Like Chilean miners emerging from the depths to a triumphant round of applause to my brother
my brother me and invite you for the modern era I'm your oldest brother Justin McElroy
I'm your middle is brother Travis McElroy I'm your sweet baby brother Griffin McElroy
they probably they probably applauded like a lot when those miners got out
yeah I'm not sure you guys Christ sack up to that which if you're in that audience how do
you know like when to stop applauding like do you think by like the 33rd one how many were there
that's an excellent question Griffin because there is like there's a moment where everybody's
like losing it right because they're like oh the first guy is the first guy is like yes and then
probably about a minor 20 they're like okay but then like 21 comes up holding a puppy and you're
like yeah and then 29 is like I think we're almost done guys let's bring this one home but
then after they were all out there had to be a moment at the end of the chair one for everybody
yeah for us we are some snacks where they were like well bye bye I guess go now do something
else like honestly I mean you're still miners you gotta go back to work in the mines like you
don't have another tomorrow tomorrow I guess not that we're still milking the miners back
yeah and the miners I am already the most sweaty that's comedy ain't easy wash it what I love
Washington DC I love it I love being in the D anytime I get a chance all this government
anytime I get to visit the DS I'm psyched about it you guys have an invisible barrier of just a
rich invisible fog of humidity that exists here it's like at this off the sea level and it's just
perfectly my underwear height and now I'm sitting it's face high time about your foggy bottoms it's
a local reverence I saw it on one of the subway platforms I'm saying it's something of a comfort
to me cuz like I watch TV and I see politicians on TV I think they're so powerful I see like
Mitch McConnell up there like women shouldn't have library cards and it's like and like everybody's
losing their minds like yeah yeah yeah but then like he walks off stage he's like my gooch is
ruined like I know as soon as they go in the back room it's like you're not so powerful anymore
cuz you're like oh my grindle is soupy like so much baby powder Kevin Spacey mommy Kevin Spacey
like walks off the set he's like Clio that was great work my under my gold goose is souped it's
so bad bring me some more of my acting trunks and I don't know well can Kevin Spacey pretending to
be I don't know why he's still in character when he's not playing Frank Drebben or whatever because
he is a method method he is method Justin whether he's hot or not he's got a soupy goose and that
is just true we do now we talk more about Kevin Spacey's taint before we get into the questions
and we got we got a lot of fun stuff playing for you this is the usual stuff but it'll be fun we
were leaving our names yeah we did that part we did that part who this is still the charming
intro there by license before the question okay we were we were leaving a restaurant last night
after eating dinner I was not here for this and I still do not think it happened Travis has
photographic evidence we leave you a place called Asia 54 I don't know if you've been but highly
recommended pretty good it's great what's great we saw Rob Reiner not there not there at our hotel
ninety eight point five nine eight point five percent Rob Reiner anyway hold on it was either
a hundred percent Rob Reiner was zero percent Rob Reiner it was not one of his failed clones
okay it was not club Reiner you mean Carl Reiner nobody's nobody's quite sure so we're leaving a
lot of clones have the Jack disease or we're leaving the restaurant and as we are leaving
this guy jumps in front of us and says be careful there's a raccoon in this tree now I'm listen I
may be from West Virginia but I've been to a big city before I know how this ends pal this ends with
you try and hit me up for cash right so my okay so I walk past him I love not exaggerating by the
way that is literally how he reacted yeah sure sure pal well there's a fucking raccoon in the
tree and before we continue on with this you need to understand I want to paint a picture for you
there's not much more but this raccoon looked terrified care this was not a taunting villain
of a raccoon this look if you had told me that raccoon was nine months old I believe yeah the
man sounds like the aggressor in this well now here's the thing we got more info as we stood
there dumbstruck he said this raccoon was chasing me down the street and then he this raccoon was
chasing me on the street and then he ran up this tree so now I'm waiting for him to come down to
anything exact your revenge any stand you gotta settle this he looks at the tree says get down
here I don't know what like I don't I do not know what like if he was drawing this on a whiteboard
the plan you know I don't know what step one yellow raccoon step two record come down step
three question mark step four vengeance vengeance yeah you get your sweet vengeance I don't that man
was vice president Joe Biden you forgot to call you here Uncle Joe Uncle Joe Jamaica you literally
we literally put him on the complex we put him on the complex wait Joe he's didn't he didn't make
him come in halfway our show yeah it's not too late we'll check in at the end yeah what our show
is we'll turn questions out can we like into wisdom and here's our first one who wait who here
is this your first experience with my brother my brother and me I see hands okay all right big
shmanners fans we we we turn quit we answer questions it's fine we do we do our best we try
damn it we try we try my young po buddies nerf picked my younger brother has recently decided in
his adulthood to begin going by his middle name while I have no problem with this choice in his
personal and professional life I am torn as to how I should now address him he insists that he
does not care one way or the other should I continue to use his first name or attempt to
break 29 years of conditioning to use the new moniker that's from doubtful designator in DC
that would be are you here wait you here like eight different people right yeah how many y'all
got younger brothers who just changed their name is this a rampant okay I need everybody to be
quiet because I don't want to muddy the result I need to know the first name in the middle name
his name okay okay and what's that wait oh I was about to ask last name it was gonna incriminate
him it was David Lee but oh shit yeah that's a good yeah can I ask the last name I didn't hear
that but it wasn't Roth so we're fine okay I'm glad that you went where I went yeah that would
be I got it I got it okay names aside it would be crazy if I was like hey guys what's up how
was your Christmas a cool I'm Bryce now wait okay it's not my middle name I should it would
be Andrew but that'd be weird hey guys Andy here here comes Andy the baby okay this is once again
this is the baby's brother drew this is the benefit of having the question asker in the
room that we don't get once again just the question asker yes or no question was this done
because they felt they needed like a business name or was this like I need a change of pace
and also what business is good for leave and not for then not for David name like David good for
lease we may not get the answer that's a business or personal all right okay I get that he said
personal got it so there was a month so there's a day he wakes up he goes to the shower a brush his
teeth he looks in the mirror he's like oh hello Lee I get I guess was that joke was funny for the
last half of the audience wait what was it say it again coward oh you didn't that's the last
time anybody's yelling anything by the way this is not that kind of show yeah this ain't a back
and forth it's not back and forth it's kind of a conduit do you guys wanna Yahoo answer from the
Yahoo answer service wait okay do you hear that Yahoo okay wait I'm cool moving on super quick we
should have at least a sentence that could qualify technically as an answer possible and whatever
yeah come on ever people you're still thinking about this when he said it doesn't matter it's
crazy to me get more life things in your life to worry about you need bigger problems this is a big
problem if you were like I'm Patrick now that would take me a year and I would never do that
Travis is an amazing but he said he doesn't care he doesn't care if he doesn't not he doesn't care
he's he's David at home he's Lee about a David in the streets and a Lee in the sheets I had to
think through that to make sure that was the idiom is that even an idiom does that qualify
okay I got a I believe that was in poor Richard's old man yeah David to bed lead to rise Julie
Martin sent in this Yahoo thank you choice by Yahoo answers user Parley Wilkinson who asks okay
Harley are you um you know what could be parlay you know what it is the fucked up nobody's nervous
okay law question this Yahoo answers user ask law question and the law question is hi guys I'm
a juggalo so I can assume y'all down with the clown I love that cocky drink by the way I just
said the word juggalo it's gonna be a while hi guys I'm a juggalo I have a hatchet man screensaver
for my phone hey that's weird phones kind of don't have screensavers I've got Dilbert's desktop
games on my phone for when I leave it on too long without interacting with my phone there's a crazy
maze and some pipes come out and make weird shapes it says Derek's phone in 3d block letters and they
wiggle back and I have a hatchet man screensaver from my phone my text notification is whoop
whoop which is what we say when we see another juggalo my fur I think I said it wrong oh wait
hold on fuck y'all yeah guys the fire marshal will shut this building the fuck down if we all
start doing juggalo mating calls my friend who is not a juggalo says that if cops pull us over
they can have probable cause to search me if they see my screensaver or hear my notification is this
true thank you for your help guys I really appreciate it smiley face I love this like
all right kids I'm gonna let you guys go with a warning this time but make sure in the future
please step out of the vehicle now the other side of that is whoo whoo indeed yes yeah carry
along I go go go for Faygo you know secret handshake that they have I don't they won't I
don't know their secret handshake I think the answer is like definitely yes like if I was a
cop and like I saw like if I saw some of this iconography I would be like I think I'd like to
see what's inside your car maybe this is a reasonable search and seizure because I really
would like to see what's in there maybe they just want to see what it's like from their point of
view like I just want to live in your shoes for a minute how's it going it's like a hieroglyphic
the hatchet man is but and it translates to roughly I love drugs and murder and murder drugs
I love murder drugs drugs that get me like crazy to murder do you mind if I just in your car to
see how things go over there what I love about this is the other side of this is that there's
definitely an orientation day where some chief of police says people that goes if you see this
hatchet man you will ask to search the car if they say whoop whoop in any form or fashion we
don't know the pronunciation you will ask to see their trunk now if it's just a bumper sticker with
Sideshow Bob in it you fucked up you lose your badge for that shit whoop whoop how about how
about another question just yeah hold on activate the iPad oh lock screen should have turned that
off he had a screen saver up our friend believes she has a life-threatening nut allergy but has
never been tested everywhere she goes she refuses to eat anything that may have any type of nut in
it however all of her friends think it's just in her head how do we get her tested so we think
we all know for sure if she's allergic or not Jesus that's from going nuts for sure and Gabby
hold on y'all here what is your day-to-day relationship with this friend where you're
like hey this done they're like no and you're like I'll get you one of these days she doesn't
want to eat nuts it's cool yeah your options are get her to eat a nut or like put up like
a put her in a big bag and like carry her to the hospital where they do the nut test like
those are the that's it I'm gonna I'm gonna lean away from the get her to eat a nut one I'm gonna
lean away from the big bad one they're both shitty they're like one of these days you're
gonna keep pushing it and pushing it and she she's just gonna say god damn it I don't like nuts okay
and that's shorter to just say I'm allergic because I don't know because then everybody's
gonna be like what about macadamia yeah I don't like those either I don't like any nuts I don't
like the concept of nuts I don't like any nuts I'm not a fan it's only nuts nut allergies are no
joke well they're not they're super not unless I think maybe it's fake and then I think we can
make jokes out of it but maybe it's not fake if you don't want us to make jokes about it get
the test that's the thing then we owe you an apology what is your friend basing it off of if
not a test I'm just like I look at a nut and I just get a bad feeling okay but flip side what's
everybody else basing it off of where they're like I saw her eat a Snickers one time I was swears
so rapper was gone she said it was a Milky Way I don't fucking believe it she threw the rapper
away she's just eating a big log I saw Snickers it could have been a Mounds but I'm pretty sure it was an Almond Joy
is your friend here oh shit
hey hey wait did you just call us here for nut allergy intervention we love you so much Debbie
eat a fucking peanut hey but listen no don't no wait no wait we're on a high-energy show here and
there's probably nuts in the lobby and oh tonight's the night tonight's the night time to dance with
don't eat that nut it's two to one majority rules I can't go to jail I don't eat the nut
let's talk about email composition to a podcast show what are you talking about your friends
imaginary nut allergy potentially imaginary because the phrase who will also be in attendance
would be fucking rad sadly absent it's too late for this one but if you're coming to if you're
coming to New York tomorrow you're like this guy does he's not gluten intolerant he'll be there
though put that second part in cuz like the material party with the most information here
it's a person who thinks they'll eat a nut and die they probably know more about this situation
than you do so sorry do what we're doing our best up here okay as long as we're sharing things so
we're recording here live at the we're recording live at the Lincoln Theatre here in Washington DC
and it's been alright RIP what RIP somebody asked didn't somebody one of our Lyft drivers
and it wasn't ours ours was cool ours was it Dwight's Dwight your Lyft driver hey everybody
it's my friend Dwight Slappy sitting exactly where Lincoln was sitting yeah yeah co-hosting
things about sheets Dwight real quick when you told your Lyft driver you want to go to
the Lincoln Theatre what'd your Lyft driver say no no he was not shot here that would have been
ironic I think oh man in my own dang theater beans our Lyft driver I'm we're telling Lyft
driver stories now to keep Travis from telling his fucking sad lip I will our Lyft driver was
awesome he was so so great but at some point him and Travis got in this like really deep
conversation about like homeless populations in urban centers and it was like no it was great
is you know it was cool idea I was like I was trying to break it up and he was going having
a really nice conversation one thing though his GPS the voice for his GPS it was T-Pain
so try to be like oh man skid row like it was horrible like there's just no respect for I wish
every time that happened trust is like but then the dude would have been like they would just go
into the woods and get up it was bad it was a bad juxtaposition hi everybody thanks for

us feel just just so wet and wild and thank you vice president Joe Biden for standing back in the
shadows and vice president Joe Biden I appreciate the fact you realized this was our night not your

this horse is like 20 years old and horses like dead it's like I had that horse and not other
horses for so long I bet after that boy that like after a certain amount of time your expectations

time we're going a little bit more fast casual president on my fast food we're taking a trip down
get your flowers that need planning cuz we're going to the Olive Garden here your olive flowers
get your olive flowers ready to plant we gotta play it something oh Olive Garden is okay the
Munch squad is a show listen to the last two episodes like I want I want the 98% of people in
this room who don't know what the fuck you're talking about the walkout going they just took
this weird talk about halfway there they talk about Olive Garden for 10 minutes do they do
that this is my first time Olive Garden is doubling its offering of breadstick sandwiches
and bringing new twist to an Italian classic cuz after you have breadstick sandwiches you're like
this is good I wish there were twice as many to choose from cuz it wasn't already hard enough
to choose I need you to start from the fucking beginning and explain to me what a bread is it
just a little just a tiny just a little like little guy sandwich pipe that you just fucking
to hit your but hey check this idea cut it down the middle put a hot dog in there you're gonna
have that one for free OG it's a breadstick sandwich I think the bread is made of breadstick
bread yeah that's fucking a sandwich you just said breadstick is not a type of bread but that's
cool beginning this week iconic Olive Garden menu items will transform it's parmesan chicken
farmers on has evolved into Parmesan Johnny Otto transform with new varieties of the legendary breadstick sandwich okay Johnny
apple seed or like fucking Paul Bunyan gather around children get this here the tale of the
breadstick this is what popped it off though my me and my lovely wife saw this in a commercial
they're also offering brand-new deep dish spaghetti pies it looks exactly how you think it would like
a big piece of angel fruit cake made out of spaghetti and frosting cheese so listen and
frosting cheese last summer America fell in love with the breadstick sandwiches when they
were debuted at Olive Garden restaurants and on food trucks touring the country we gotta
get this to the people you can't contain this in an Olive Garden these breadstick sandwiches
and spaghetti pie are too good so the Olive Garden never ending family table across the
nation to give fans the opportunity to gather together and sample the new menu items sounds
like a cool afternoon it kicked off in New York City where I'm sure did great the way
you're sitting right now makes it look like you just ate a deep dish spaghetti pie I got
the quote here and this is really the in case you're curious they're doing a spicy Calibrian
chicken breadstick sandwich and eggplant parmesan breadstick sandwich that's not pretty good
anyway here's the quote and this is what the munch squad is really all about it's about
taking the words of the experts who create food and getting their opinions about scooping
up the barf of bad PR and then showing it to you like a proud cat look at this look
at this PR barf we got this for you last year we were thrilled and our guests enthusiasm
for our breadstick sandwiches and look forward to sharing our latest breadstick and spaghetti
innovations I want to break that down bit by bit we were thrilled we've really done
it because what that let me translate that for you are you fucking eating it you weren't
supposed to oh god he's liking it he's giving it to his kid that was a joke you're on you're
on punked and you were scooping it into your ma I am horrified can I put thrilled I yes
it seems it was kind of scary yeah nothing that's from Jose Duenas executive vice president
of marketing for Olive Garden unbiased he would like it yeah since nothing brings loved
ones together like food food we're excited to help our fans create amazing memories around
the table with our never-ending do you remember when grandpa died I'll never forget that time
I ate spaghetti pie but how everybody looked anyway that's the much squat you um you used
to work at the OG I was a line shift the OG for a month I was supposed to be a dishwasher
and when I went back to get trained I saw the guy who was the current dishwasher take
a ramekin of minestrone and a jam it like a shooter so when they asked him who I was

clothing forever what would it be the obvious answer is whatever a breadstick sandwich or
spaghetti pie yeah spaghetti pie sure so let's take those off let's take those off the table

because you just blew my fucking mind I didn't think about this like if somebody can you
like what food do you want I'd be like grain hey I'm on the spot here I'm sorry so I'm
not big ups on like the lore of my baby I'm my dad that's okay I'm diving back but don't
go to D so what's the what what makes a wet stunt what okay so I'll start with I'll start
here in DC they all wet yeah you picked a really bad time to come to DC I stepped out
of our hotel and I got a lift and that was a wet fucking stunt because the time it took
me to get out of the air-conditioned lobby to like cell reception zone there was the
the freshness seal had been it gets bad really quick it does it does Chris picture a stunt
okay now picture it dripping wet okay it's really anything and so there has to be some
liquid my bad picture a dripping way okay don't put words in my mouth that's not a
way it's done is it I do want to ask you Chris I don't want to put you on the spot
okay what do you intend to do with this information it's it's just vexed me for a while okay but
you're not like gonna like go fucking like hang gliding with some new experimental rig
that you've invented and back this seems pretty way I'm hey hey I might I don't know okay
you're not responsible so don't worry about it that's right you heard that one thing you
all take away from this tonight we're not responsible yeah play the disclaimer enjoy
your nuts yeah all right thank you Chris thank you help at all thank you it wasn't really
an advice I saw this beard oh come on beard hey there my name is Peter hi Peter hello
Peter my Yahoo Answers username is Equus Princess oh that's a beautiful beautiful shirt I need
him to be removed no what's up how can we help yeah so I lived in Philly for a long
time and my nice yeah okay kind of rude so my German Shepherd kept finding what appeared
to be human bones in our yard let him finish sorry I'm gonna say let him finish this is
really important can you get can you just eat that you're a tall man get in there just
eat that man yeah so so she seemed to be finding what appeared to be human bones that were
potentially confirmed by my sister-in-law who's a doctor yeah looks like rib bones
or something and a murderer no it's just and and then and my uncle we moved to DC and
it stopped okay and then just a few days ago my wife was home with the dogs and the dog
found one rib bone and then was it a different location later or a couple right and the next
day there was an another bone that that showed up is your dog killing the people that's the
only thing that makes sense yeah it doesn't make sense your dog David fucking Caruso
like well so so here's here's the case I dig it the thing that the thing that I'm concerned
about is we just got back from Seattle and we get more monitor on us from the crowd mics
yeah I heard you say Seattle yeah the thing that bothers me is that we just got back from
Seattle my wife and I okay and we took a small side trip to Lake Sammamish okay where's that
that's where Ted Bundy abducted a bunch of people and and that was that that was at my
wife's request okay and then the bones wait is this a cry for help do you need to come
up here with us there's so many parts of this episode that are gonna be in like a courtroom
somewhere so so am I good yeah you're great okay you totally what could possibly happen
it's gonna be like okay I do I do have a question that I have to have it answered when you're
done with them do you when you're done with them do you just throw the human bones in
the garbage well what would you suggest call the police yeah I would run some tests at
the lab say that say I actually am a scientist I work for the NIH so I could probably do
that all right all right the nuclear Institute yeah why are you asking us about what to do
with the bones in because I gave you my money and I'm here to ask a question I don't come
to you and I'm like I did a yahoo during a live show about having a picture of food on
your clothes it sucked what should I do about it because I know I just shouldn't do it I'm
not gonna you know I hope we helped no I don't know I don't think we did like even close
to anything like helping at all why'd you keep watch you keep all of them until you
got skeleton going at least like half a skeleton and then see maybe it's a person your dog
killed it'll be like one of those 3d puzzles right yeah hey Chris who does your dog hate
wait no who did your dog hate that isn't around anymore anybody no am I have a friendly
dog that okay thanks guys thanks let's go farther back let's go farther back further
back okay back okay wait no no way back no no way back in the middle there you raise
your head stand up yes yes yes no no wait all the way back come on yeah yeah this is
a super nice theater I can like see it real good now the lights are up good job Lincoln
theater people you you got it really pretty in here hi what's your name hey I'm Becky
hi Becky hi Becky um I it is not a bummer I just wanted to clarify um that's what people
say when the first half is it's not it's not okay um so I uh I have a painting uh and it's
not haunted or anything it's just a painting that was my first fuck who's the who's the
painting getting older I have a I have a doll that's also haunted um no I have a painting
the problem is that it is a painting of me um it was done by my my brother-in-law I know
it's great it's great to have a painting I was like four years old just a super cute
you know just a painting of my head region um you know so it's just this like painting
this like you know bust painting of four year old and I was like super cute oh you're four
I am currently four I'm no in the painting you were four yes yes I think we've established
there's a painting of you yeah and and I kind of don't know what to do with it yeah for
sure no totally right there with you dog super yes because like I feel like if I were living
you know I'm living on my own for the first time I feel like if I was living with like
you know husband and kids it could be like up there with the family portraits or whatever
but I'm just in an apartment no yes by myself I don't know that I'm gonna have any advice
you I'm just like yeah dog that's rough like what you've got is what we call a showpiece
ah and what that means is when someone visits you the first time you have to take them into
a room that's completely empty except for a painting on the wall where you just stand
in front of it and go one day I'll get back there I think you're overestimating my my
rent budget where I can just have spare room sleep in your bathroom ah that's the solution
can you put the painting in the bathroom oh like on the toilet like I have to confront
it before they little speech balloon it just isn't nice I feel like that's that's disrespectful
to the painting like my brother-in-law did it it's a nice painting he did it was nice
of him it was a oh my god is he alive see so yes okay he's get him to well I don't want
because I got you okay preemptive get him to paint another one on the same picture of
you behind you like today looking on like so proud you're like oh look I did it recursive
paintings of myself forever I think you have to have a party where you unveil it to everybody
and then who first of all whoever sticks around that's your real friends but I'm thinking
about it now and like fuck dude if I had something like this in like my first place where I was
living by myself and it was like let's go over to Griffin's place and hang out with
this weird painting that's fun like that you could if you can own it's a hard needle holy
shit cuz like if it goes if you miss the needle hole then you're fucking Kathy Bates in misery
or something but if you can get it right in there then you've got like the dopest prop
comedy like literally ever here's the phrase you have to practice oh that get the delivery
of those two words down and you're gonna miss but then you have like a holiday party at
your place you have like a holiday party and you put like a little Santa hat cut out on
top of it it can like transform with each like new thing Super Bowl Sunday like seasonal
decorations on baby me painting own it all right your friends come over and the frame
is empty and you're like I don't know gotta get him real used to it okay own it and hide
it and then hide it all right Justin you I just did you just did oh I'll pick one let's
say wait wait wait wait okay we're so fucking bad at this just do something over there there's
a hand right yes you pointed to yourself in the shirt yeah that's nothing you can't just
say in the shirt you're all wearing shirts everybody's got shirts in here I hope hi how's
it going hey I'm great how are you what's your name Carrie hi Carrie how can we help
so I just got a present in the mail the other day from a not super close family friend it's
a co-worker of my mom's and she got me a pair of tap shoes she sent me a pair of tab shoes
in the mail I've never tap danced but I don't want to be a dick what do I do wait this is
an important question are these tap shoes brand new they are brand new in the box holy
shit like these Carrie feeling here's a bunch of clay why I just think you care about it
I don't know there's an old there's an old curve on a good quote that random ass tap shoes
are dancing lessons from God maybe you need maybe this is a sign you know like maybe it's
time for you to really take stock and say like I like that because maybe the family
friend realizes something in you that you don't realize in your slightly so this is
your my mom's co-worker who I've never met maybe she came from my mom okay wait no this
is a question how do I tell my mom not to give my address yeah maybe she saw a picture
of you on a desk or something okay maybe she's something what's your mom's name Kathy cat
Kathy listen I'm looking at the picture of your daughter and I'm going to tell you something
just one more question you're not going to believe me but I'm going to tell you the one
thing those are tappers camps I'm looking at a curvature they are on the calf these
are the gams of a tapper I am sending her the shoes Kathy do not try to talk me out
of this those are tapas legs can they let me ask you if your mom arose you you know
she will she's gonna call you a month carry all the tap shoes working out you have the
legs for listen to me trust me on this one is a tapas this is Deborah by the way it's
Deborah listen we haven't met I'm gonna ask you a question I feel like I already know
the answer to you've definitely put these bad boys on though right yes and I suck at
tap dancing but how do you get to Carnegie Hall probably by pissing off my downstairs
neighbors yeah definitely because I think about it now like it would be like I get the
box of tap shoes from a total rando and I open it up and Rachel would be like those
tap shoes I'd be like yeah and she'd be like who are they from and they're like already
on my feet I don't fucking know what my dad's weird friends but I can't stop dancing oh
god oh god who's Brian I don't fucking know watch me go I can tell you who's Savion Glover
is though how was that yeah we have time for like one more who has a super good one super
good one okay no wait hold on raising your hand up very high still very like the highest
stand up and I want to tell you it's you yes it's you come on down I got a good feeling
about that when you said super good there's a lot of waving okay take your word for it
really good wave yeah no pressure damn hi hi thanks I did my best you did great what's
your name Emma Emma okay okay so I live in a really big apartment building and there's
sort of a hallway there's a hallway and there's just me and one other person at the end of
this hallway okay and it's a old apartment building lots of policies we're not allowed
to have pets okay my neighbor has a secret dog oh shit I've heard it I've seen it I've
seen them trying to hide the dog from me what do I do wait hold on I need a couple things
how big is the dog it's a little it's a small dog this could be anything give me the it's
like the size of a breadbox yeah they have a rectangular dog quiet relatively quiet at
night yes during the day especially when I'm coming in and out for work not really how
absolute is your sense of justice judge dread
because it sounds like it might be pretty absolute maybe wait hold on to Emma's credit
I felt like she was asking how do I let them know that I'm cool with it they don't have
to how do you get some of that juice on the side like some of that money on Saturdays
don't even trip like can I since I know there's a dog can I like go and be like I won't tell
them if you let me like hang out with it yeah yeah that is exactly what I want to paint
a picture of people at home literally every person in this theater was like yes that's
fucking blackmail you know the only thing better than a dog Griffin the only thing sweeter
than a dog a secret dog every single procedure was like yeah blackmail that fool I don't
care if it's like the most adorable blackmail ever blackmail it's definitely blackmail gray
mail at best man um I guess blackmail your neighbors is it annoying is the dog is the
dog I had a secret dog once for like four days your dog was no secret it was not a secret
dog it was everybody knew about this dog including my neighbors who did bust us I was in college
just rough stuff is a rough situation I got a good scam for you get a dog your own and
then when the landlord's like do you have a dog you say no I think that's the neighbors
you didn't hear it from me but I'm pretty sure they got a breadbox dog over there um
