1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:30,720
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:44,320
It's a new craze, and good girls do you wanna just say, hey, I wanna, just say, hey, I wanna.

6
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:47,920
Welcome, my brother, my brother, and the advice show from the modern era. I'm your oldest brother,

7
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:51,600
Justin McElroy. I'm your middle brother, Travis McElroy. I'm your baby's baby brother,

8
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:56,640
Griffin McElroy. We spoke on this last week. I wanted to update everyone in our listening audience.

9
00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:03,120
Refresher correction, retraction, and updates. No, updates. Start with an update. We spoke

10
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:09,680
last week about unusual animal pairings, and how they always start off with negligence.

11
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:14,640
I found this new one on CNN that I wanted to mention to you guys.

12
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:22,240
Dallas Zoo brings in puppy to calm down cheetahs. Yeah. No.

13
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:27,440
Does it mean because the cheetahs chase the puppies and wear themselves out?

14
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:33,920
They get so tired eating puppies. I'm gonna lay down, take a nap.

15
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:40,480
Can you imagine that puppy, like, are you sure this is, I've only been alive for like two months.

16
00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:47,120
Are you sure this is cool? Cause those look like giant cats, which I'm already not crazy about that

17
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:52,800
whole genus. Listen, in this economy, I'm really happy for the work, so thank you, first and

18
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:58,960
foremost, but hard out there for a contract. I'm looking at the contract here, and it says that

19
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:06,000
there is a significant chance I'm going to be, if I read this correctly, consumed. Consumed wholesale.

20
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:10,960
Is this, I know I'm a puppy and my reading skills, not so great. So can you confirm or

21
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:18,080
deny that this says the puppy will be consumed guaranteed? So I'm sorry to that puppy. I'm also

22
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:25,360
sorry to, and God, I can't, this is, this is the website for CNN. Stubs the cat. Alaska town mayor

23
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:35,280
mauled by dog. Is there nothing? God, they just can't, they just can't let, can't let a cat get

24
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:43,360
ahead, can they? Fucking Malcolm X, Martin Luther King, JFK, the government will take down any leader

25
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:48,400
that they don't, uh, that they don't agree with. Now Stubs the cat, uh, has been mauled by the

26
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:53,920
opposition dog. It's a fucking terrible world out there. Let's all, let's all go around the circle

27
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:58,960
and talk about the most terrible thing that that is happening right now. Travis, Justin, we know

28
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:06,560
yours. Okay. Is this, is this mish-mashing of unlike animals. It's a shame, said Ashley Curds,

29
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:12,560
who works at the pizza shop in the small town 110 miles north of Anchorage. He's the mayor.

30
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:18,320
It's not a joke. I know it's ridiculous, but the town is run really well.

31
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:27,440
Oh, this is the fucking libertarian dream. I know cats in power, no laws, legal weed.

32
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:33,360
Cabinet for everyone. I'll tell you my thing tonight,

33
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:38,240
Carrie Underwood is going to perform the NFL Sunday night football theme song.

34
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:44,800
Um, the, the song has been waiting all day for Sunday night, which just seems like a child,

35
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:49,440
like an impatient child would say. There are so many things you can do during Sunday day that

36
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:54,160
are great, but she's replacing Faith Hill. Like they won't expect us to fucking notice.

37
00:03:54,800 --> 00:04:00,080
Like they won't. Oh, a pretty blonde country singer. That must be Faith Hill. She's looking good.

38
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:06,320
Wait, it's your model, huh? It's, it's a, it's a fucking crying shame. I'm sure she'll do a great

39
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:11,840
job, but like, what else does Faith have? Her and Tim are on the outs, I think. Well,

40
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:16,560
do you guys want to hear some good news? I thought I explicitly said only bad things though.

41
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:25,280
Can you frame the good news in a bad way? Yeah. So they're remaking Robocop. What the fuck?

42
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:33,280
But also my Michael Keaton's in it. So he's not dead. Michael Keaton is alive and he's a Robocop.

43
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:38,320
That's a job. Michael Keaton. Let's help. You know, I'm tired of, I'm tired of hurting people.

44
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:43,440
I want to pick their spirits back up and help them out. So this is an advice show. So let's do that.

45
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:50,240
I'm about to start announcing girls' volleyball games. What are some calls I can give to pump up

46
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:56,720
the crowd? And that's from priming to pump in Castle Rock, CO. That's Colorado, right? It's

47
00:04:56,720 --> 00:05:03,840
Columbus. They're in Castle Rock, Columbus. This is so important. I'm so glad to see you can't

48
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:11,040
just start pumping people up unless you yourself have pumped yourself. I think you have to be

49
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:17,360
pre-pumped to pump a crowd up and then by the end of it you should be just deflated. I think Dale

50
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:22,320
Carnegie said that, didn't he? Yeah. He said you can't expect people to pump you if you don't pump

51
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:27,840
them in exchange. Can I start? This is a circle of pumping. Can I recommend that you kick off

52
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:33,920
every volleyball game with a new custom theme song from Faith Hill, who now has a lot more time in

53
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:40,400
her schedule, like Waitin' All Afternoon for Thursday evening at the JC. She has to change

54
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:46,080
some of the words or else Carrie Underwood. Waitin' All Week for Bump Set Spike. Ooh,

55
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:50,960
that fucking goddamn! Auto-tune that shit and we are halfway there.

56
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:55,600
And just getting Faith Hill. That's the only other thing. And Faith Hill, yes. Well,

57
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:58,640
I think if we auto-tune you enough we can make you sound like Faith Hill.

58
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:05,600
When you say calls to pump up the crowd, does that mean like you're saying to them like get

59
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:12,080
pumped or like your reaction to exciting things that just happened? Maybe they are in some sort

60
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:18,480
of dictatorial city state where like they just shout commands over a megaphone and then everybody

61
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:25,040
else has to like stand or clap in compliance. Killer shot! Now it's time for government-mandated

62
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:31,520
push-ups! Yeah, yeah. Jump rope for heart. Or else. Every. Jump rope. Jump rope or we'll

63
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:34,640
detonate the tiny bomb installed in everyone's heart by the government.

64
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:42,400
It's Kim Trails, guys. This is like basic 101 shit. Loose change. You guys know about Kim Trails,

65
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:46,880
right? They're fucking everything. They're everything and everywhere. I feel like the only

66
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:53,440
thing you can do at any sports event anymore is play the theme from Space Jam. Like when they're

67
00:06:53,440 --> 00:07:01,040
talking about uh we got a new jam going welcome to the slam like that's gonna get people so so

68
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:05,120
pumped. Maybe but there are many sports where slamming and jamming are the operative verbs.

69
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:10,400
There's very little slamming and or jamming in like water polo. No actually there's probably

70
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:14,720
some jamming but I don't think there's any slamming in water polo. I think it's mostly

71
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:22,720
just like trying to try not to drown and throwing. So try not to drown and then you throw the ball.

72
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:30,640
Quad City DJs could do a different theme song for every sport. Hi-Li. Just stay the fuck stay safe.

73
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:38,960
It's a very dangerous sport. It's a very heavy ball. It travels very quickly. So scoop it up

74
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:45,120
and then tighten your pants. They have tight pants on Hi-Li I think. Not familiar. I don't

75
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:49,840
think you can tighten pants when you have hook hands on. Although that'd be really fun to see.

76
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:55,680
If someone's pants fall down on the fucking Hi-Li court. You're done. You're done. Oh god I need

77
00:07:55,680 --> 00:08:01,360
ah I need a fan in the audience to jump down and help me. Time out. Yeah you just if that happens

78
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:08,400
you start using your scoops to dig him a grave because he is dead. Wait do the fans have to wear

79
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:13,920
scoops too? I've never seen Hi-Li. Everyone wears the scoops in case they need to get called in.

80
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:18,400
Oh it's just like when someone wears everyone wears a mitt like a baseball game to catch foul

81
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:23,840
balls you wear the scoops so that you don't die in the crowd. Is this what about like is it uh

82
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:36,400
is it teen school volleyball or is it like um is it uh raunchy beach volleyball? Because that's

83
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:42,080
an incredibly important distinction to okay so let's do for both because I'm gonna say for like

84
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:48,240
the high school teens say stuff like uh get on your feet and cheer for these girls potential.

85
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:55,600
Yeah. I would love to be at that game. They have bright futures ahead of them in whatever career

86
00:08:55,600 --> 00:09:02,640
they choose. Yeah. And the other one is beach volleyball and you're like jug of bugs. The

87
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:14,080
juggy one spiked the other juggy one whoo. Millie time. Keep an eye out here comes the

88
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:22,560
jug cannon where we shoot distant body jugs at the crowd. It's a health code violation that's

89
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:31,760
why you signed a waver wa-wa-wa-wa-wa-wa-waver. Maybe. Maybe. I'm on board. Maybe you set the

90
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:38,400
volleyball on fire somehow. Whoa. Could you do what bowling alleys do and just make it like

91
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:42,800
extreme cosmic volleyball and like make the net glow in the dark and like the ball glow and

92
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:46,640
everybody's got like war paint on. Hey what happened gentlemen I think we've extended our

93
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:51,760
plan beyond the reach of what you can accomplish as an announcer at the game. I mean you could

94
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:57,440
demand that the ball be set on fire all you want from your shitty booth but I don't think anybody's

95
00:09:57,440 --> 00:10:01,600
gonna listen to you. What kind of high school wait whoa hold on what kind of a high school

96
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:06,720
volleyball court do you think this is or they have an announcing booth? I think yeah it's it is a

97
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:12,800
fucking fold out is the lunch table that has been poorly converted. I think the way you get people

98
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:16,880
pumped up is you shout these suggestions of ways to make the sport more awesome.

99
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:24,640
Like put some pumas out there with um yeah clap if you like. That spike now imagine if it had been

100
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:30,240
glow in the dark am I right people leave your suggestions on your way out. What if his volleyball

101
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:38,800
court was in a rancor pit from star wars like what are you talking about? Demand that the audience

102
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:45,360
imagine these things like you don't have to make it happen just and now for the next time things

103
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:51,280
with the hitting we're all gonna imagine it's on fire. Get on your feet let me paint you a picture

104
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:59,040
with my words. Griffin how about a yahoo? Yeah sure uh this yahoo was sent in by Julie Kin thank

105
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:06,160
you Julie Kin it's by yahoo answers user Casey Cherry who asks what to wear with a black cape?

106
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:14,160
I bought it ages ago so I can't really find a picture for you. It has one tab fastening like

107
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:20,400
and then there's a pic of what a cape fastener looks like. No it doesn't have a collar it doesn't

108
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:24,640
look right with anything other than tank tops but it's getting colder and I want to find something

109
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:30,240
warmer to wear under it what would be the best color thing to wear with it? Now um this is not

110
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:40,560
a Dracula costume cape it's just it's just like a black maybe wool cape. There is not a single word

111
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:49,840
in that question that doesn't hurt my heart. It only looks good with a tank top. That person they're

112
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:56,560
a human on the same planet you yourself live on listener that recently maybe not so recently

113
00:11:56,560 --> 00:12:00,320
because they apparently can't find the cape that they so desperately want to wear to take a picture

114
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:07,520
of it that that person stood in front of a full-length mirror with a black cape and a fuchsia

115
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:14,480
tank top and adjusted their top hat and thought yes this is a look. Now okay let me go further

116
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:19,520
with this picture with words. Imagine like one of those movie montages where the people go to try

117
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:24,320
out new looks for like the nerdy guy and like he keeps coming out of the dressing room and they're

118
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:29,920
like no or like yeah but it's just a string of him standing quietly in front of the mirror

119
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:40,400
cape and sweater. No. No. Cape and winter jacket. No. Cape and tank top. Yeah. Yeah I found it.

120
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:47,520
Cape and smaller cape that you wear in the front. They call that a bib. Jacob it's a bib.

121
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:54,320
It's a big joke. Cape and school marm dress. Yes. No not oh so close. Boy that could really spice up

122
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:59,600
your visits to Red Lobster though if you told everybody you're wearing a front cape. Or just

123
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:03,760
trying to avoid getting butter on you. If you can't afford a nice high quality cape from from

124
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:11,040
Nordstrom Rack you just when you're done consuming your crab butter mass then you just flip that

125
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:18,160
sloppy bib. Flip that sloppy bib. Put it on your back and you got a you got a floppy grease cape.

126
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:24,240
You're gonna fight so much crime. So much crustacean crime. I would be afraid of a person

127
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:29,680
doing that to be fair. It's the buttery mess. Get out of here. Get out of here. Everybody run.

128
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:34,560
His hands are like cheddar bay biscuits. He's gonna grease us up. Can that be a YouTube meme

129
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:39,200
like the kids who go to the through like McDonald's and they grab the ice cream cone from the wrong

130
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:45,760
end or like a thing that you do to just like totally freak out. Yeah it's like a kid thing

131
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:50,160
that kids do on YouTube. They order ice cream from McDonald's and then like they hand the

132
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:55,840
cashier hands them the ice cream and they grab it by the ice cream. It freaks people shit out.

133
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:59,840
Like it's a pretty good goof but like I I think that the food service industry needs to be

134
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:09,200
tormented I guess. If we uh if we like podcast wide agree that grabbing the ice cream by the ice

135
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:14,320
cream part is a quote pretty good goof. Yeah. I think that explains a lot about the quality of

136
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:20,960
our show over the past few months. I'm I I listen I'm all about shattering expectations and that's

137
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:26,160
what these people are doing one one scoop at a time. I think you flip that bib around. People

138
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:30,960
are gonna be confused. They're gonna talk. I think that I'll go to really take at the right lobster

139
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:36,000
saying oh thank you so much could I get some extra bibs to take home with me. I think that

140
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:42,240
would be enough to really just I don't know I frightened the the waiter or waitress. I'm I'm

141
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:47,200
I'm doing something and I don't want to get into it but it involves a lot of a lot of clarified

142
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:53,920
butter. Let me put it discreetly. I'm a sloppy boy. Real sloppy sloppy poppy. Sloppy boy.

143
00:14:53,920 --> 00:15:02,080
Um I think you can there's a way to make a fucking cape work for you. I think there's not

144
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:08,320
everybody right. Do you think everybody can pull off a cape. Not everybody no and like let's just

145
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:14,480
let's just shadow the illusion that tank tops can fit. Tank tops don't go with anything. You wear

146
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:18,640
them because it's so hot and humid outside and you don't want anything on your arms or your

147
00:15:18,640 --> 00:15:23,280
shoulders or your pits. That is the only context that you wear a tank top. You don't say. Griffin

148
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:26,960
I know that you live in Austin. Have you crumbled to tank top pressure yet? I'll never wear a

149
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:33,600
fucking tank top. Although I see dudes who do that wear like the full blown Rastafarian like neck

150
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:43,360
cut down to their ball sack and I'm like god you look so dry. You look so dry and so comfy and I

151
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:49,120
I'm sitting there in my stupid v-neck t-shirt. There is I think there are very few clothing

152
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:56,400
items. Actually you know what maybe this is why the cape and the tank top uh work together so well

153
00:15:57,040 --> 00:16:03,920
is that they are both items with an extremely high risk reward. I mean if you can nail the tank top

154
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:08,480
look. What is the reward of the cape? What is the what is the surprise? Okay but think about it this

155
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:15,120
way. It lets you blend it in the shadows. If you can if you are wearing the cape there is a 99%

156
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:23,920
chance that just you're king dipshit but if you nail it oh my god forget about it you're the mayor

157
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:29,440
you and that cat are co-mayor. Justin I just need to know real quick what would nailing it

158
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:36,880
in wearing a cape entail? Travis the odds against nailing a cape as an ensemble choice are so narrow

159
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:42,000
that I myself like if I could just sit here and tell you how to make a cape work I I wouldn't be

160
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:48,480
on a podcast I'd be fucking gallivanting on the Riviera wooing heiresses like I feel like the one

161
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:54,000
the one chance for it to quote be nailed is if you're wearing the cape you're getting picked on

162
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:59,840
by some bullies or people making fun of you but then a cry rings out from the alley you rush in

163
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:04,720
save a woman from a mugger or something a fucking superhero and then it's like you know I then

164
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:11,280
wearing the cape is justified for about 30 minutes but other than that I cannot envision a circumstance

165
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:15,200
in which you are wearing a cape and somebody looks at you and goes yeah it's justified if

166
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:18,960
you could emerge from the shadows I bet you could sneak a lot of hoagies into a football game

167
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:27,040
here comes count hoagie smell like onions and roast beef count hoagie and his dream

168
00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:35,600
code of mini sandwiches there was ham and salami and cheddar and biscuits and cheese

169
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:43,680
and mustard and there's a little show tunes humor for you how about a new question so I'm a 21 year

170
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:50,800
old guy in college and I just adopted my first pet it's a cat named Leonardo Dicatio he's cool

171
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:55,760
but he's extremely bitey all the time when he's happy when he's sad when he's playful whatever

172
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:59,680
he bites the crap out of you he's only six months old so I'm hoping he'll grow out of this

173
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:05,040
but he is huge for his age so he hurts a lot more than he means to should I just start discouraging

174
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:11,040
him when he bites will he grow out of it is it possible my cat is just an asshole that's from

175
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:17,840
Tim McVicker uh Tim if you wanted to start discouraging your cat from bite like what is

176
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:24,720
your reaction right now oh you got me uh that and I'm gonna throw this out and let and hear me out

177
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:31,840
all cats are assholes now I know somebody at home just threw their headphones off their head

178
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:38,080
I love cats and onto a cat and you gotta listen to this shit come here listen this guy is espousing

179
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:45,120
some real heinous shit about your entire species he said you are all assholes they are but just

180
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:49,760
like you have lots of friends that are assholes they're lovable assholes and they're great but

181
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:55,680
yeah cats are assholes can I can I can I have a suggestion um because I have a very large very

182
00:18:55,680 --> 00:19:02,720
violent cat that attacks me on the reg um and I have found a surefire way of dealing with it

183
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:11,120
and it is stop being such a fucking pussy baby he's got his teeth are little he's got little

184
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:17,680
six-month-old kitty teeth oh he bites my skin oh no bitey bite no hurts ow band-aids

185
00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:25,040
I would rather have I gotta rub it on my baby kitty bites I can't touch one of my cats

186
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:31,920
got two cats one was fat and just chills the other one you can't touch them can't can't uh

188
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:43,040
had any physical contact with this fucking cat this cat is is a goddamn hologram for all I know

189
00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:50,320
Justin has invented some sort of clever hologram cat technology that is I can't you can't do it

190
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:56,240
the cat and a cat has a sweet deal because the cat's like okay you know I'll eat oh and all

191
00:19:56,240 --> 00:20:02,080
your food no probs oh you want a petto nope nope nope no I also want to throw out though Justin

192
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:08,240
it's very possible that CJ is also very spookable but where's she gonna go yeah she's she she would

193
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:14,560
just waddle uh waddle away I still catch everybody I'm so panicked ah what am I gonna do in the in

194
00:20:14,560 --> 00:20:20,720
adding insult to injury the small cat the spookable one Amelia she will like literally

195
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:27,680
if CJ lies down for a couple minutes the cat will like envelop herself into CJ she'll use CJ

196
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:33,600
like a parka and just wrap herself like okay on so it's not physical contact yes exactly Travis

197
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:39,120
she'll climb into CJ's fat and control herself like a Pacific like a Jaeger from Pacific Rim

198
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:47,760
yeah but but no a human a human who controls like money and food and has invented shit yeah

fucking rock star uh I guess if that's what your definition of a rock star let me let me

210
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:56,800
rephrase is he the guy who looks like a failed bassist he looks like yes he looks like four

211
00:21:56,800 --> 00:22:01,840
different bassists all rolled together he's got don't be disturbed when Jackson Galaxy shows up

212
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:09,120
to your house with his crazy wraparound goggle glasses and his anthrax beard and his mutton chops

213
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:14,800
and his his Michael Stipe bald head like a frankenbassist he's a frankenbassist but I tell

214
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:22,560
you what he will take your cat from a zero to a four not to a hero cats can't be heroes but to

215
00:22:22,560 --> 00:22:29,200
our cats have a pretty good deal uh we have an understanding now where if they do something bad

216
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:36,720
what I do is I spray them with the spray bottle of water that I keep next to the couch at all times

217
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:43,120
like some sort of alcoholic father but I spray them with the spray bottle and then they know

218
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:48,720
immediately they go to Sydney and start rubbing on her to indicate their wetness at which point

219
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:55,120
I get in trouble for spraying the cats so it's a whole it's a whole circle we have worked out it's

220
00:22:55,120 --> 00:23:00,320
really great um on the real though do you know what fixed my cat started putting that motherfucker

221
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:06,080
outside it's hard out there isn't it pretty soft pretty sweet you got in here huh no no I think

222
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:10,880
it's outside time I think someone's forgotten I think someone's forgotten about the giant metal

223
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:16,800
dragons that live outside have fun what we did is we just started putting a harness on the cat

224
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:20,560
like we were going to walk her but we just put the harness on her and she just immediately like

225
00:23:20,560 --> 00:23:25,200
lays flat on the ground and doesn't move until you take the harness off and it's like this weird

226
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:29,840
kind of force field of like it just completely cancels out all of her willpower and soul we

227
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:35,520
actually had one of those for Travis from ages three to seven team uh I uh people got pissed

228
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:40,240
off at me when I instagrammed and vine pictures of my cat in a harness and a leash as you're

229
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:44,960
training it to go outside like cats aren't supposed to do that like yeah I guess what dogs

230
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:50,640
probably aren't either like it's just like we do that with them like I don't think dogs like a dog

231
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:55,360
in the wild you never see like a hyena in a harness yeah dogs aren't like oh restrictions cool

232
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:59,760
no they're like I just because I'm not an animal who likes to run and play yeah

233
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:06,880
um you gotta y'all gotta watch this fucking Jackson Galaxy show you think your fucking cat

234
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:13,440
is terrible this cat will like there are cats on that show that will like bite a man's sleeping

235
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:18,960
balls and then as he sits up the cat is on its face like a face hugger from aliens and will like

236
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:24,880
piss up its his nose then he leans into your it leans into his ear and says I stole your identity

237
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:34,080
there are episodes of that show that are like the goddamn exorcist for Jackson Galaxy like

238
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:37,440
Jackson Galaxy's dead because one cat like threw him down a flight of stairs

239

00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:49,520
carpe diem sure um i am you're what finished your thought finish the thought marcus don't resist

321

326
00:34:36,720 --> 00:34:44,480
um all great terrific quotes from popular media and history here's what i've been trying out

327
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:51,120
marcus time is that working just your name and then the word time assuming your name is one word

328
00:34:52,320 --> 00:35:01,520
um i i'm confused by the parameters of this question i'm because it says two word quotes

329
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:08,320
but it seems like all marcus did was list two words paired together yeah i would love to be

330
00:35:09,120 --> 00:35:17,920
so fucking fresh that i could just i could be cemented in history for just dropping a handful

331
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:24,960
of syllables on somebody like you remember what griffin mcroy said discover cowabunga bart simpson

335
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:52,320

now free pizza griffin are there any other people trying to answer this question someone said what

344
00:36:58,320 --> 00:37:03,520
and that was vinnie barbarino john travolta from welcome back cotter i don't remember him saying

345
00:37:03,520 --> 00:37:08,800
that i think this was just like a cotter file just like trying to spread his seed as far as

346
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:15,600
you can possibly go oh my god we forgot the best one oh how rude oh that's see that's fucking on

00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:33,920
dead wife that was and danny i love when danny tanner would be in like a down moment

349
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:41,680
yeah dead wife dead wife that episode where like everybody left the kitchen to go get pizza and

350
00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:47,200
danny was left alone and just quietly looked into his drink mother's dead wife that was a great

351
00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:54,960
half hour of comedy um how about uh my rippers and that's jesse he's talking about someone asks

352
00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:59,360
hey who are the other members of your band he says oh my rippers he doesn't say oh because

353
00:37:59,360 --> 00:38:10,000
it's just two words meth please and that was uh jody sweeten because she is it too soon to joke

354
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:16,480
about her it's too soon to joke about not soon enough actually no one's gonna get that comet's

355
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:26,560
dead comet never died he lives on in our hearts sag it chop and that was when bob saget great

356
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:31,600
fight when yeah when did you guys ever notice how there were like a crazy amount of fight scenes in

357
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:38,160
tgif shows fucking fucking step by step did one like literally every third episode patrick i think

358
00:38:38,160 --> 00:38:42,160
patrick duffy had like something in his contract where he's like i need to i actually don't think

359
00:38:42,160 --> 00:38:47,120
that's a joke griffin i think that crash of duffy because you're right and you could tell because

360
00:38:47,120 --> 00:38:53,600
the camera because this was a multi-camera comedy yeah the camera would take this very odd angle

361
00:38:53,600 --> 00:38:58,720
that it never really takes where you see how small the set actually is because it's basically

362
00:38:58,720 --> 00:39:03,920
just looking at dead on and you could smell like oh man patrick duffy's about to beat some ass

363
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:08,240
it really was it like every time they went to a bar every time there was a scene in a bar you're

364
00:39:08,240 --> 00:39:13,120
like oh duffy's about to do some whoopings i feel like that happened a lot in like there were always

365
00:39:13,120 --> 00:39:17,680
people challenging people to something and like it's every time there wanted to be a lesson about

366
00:39:17,680 --> 00:39:22,000
like what it really means to stand up to a bully or like use your brain the answer there was one

367
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:29,440
fucking episode where urkel in family matters like there was a rope climbing challenge and like the

368
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:34,640
one of the jocks challenged him to a rope climbing competition like everyone had happened to them in

369
00:39:34,640 --> 00:39:43,200
high school it was very relatable and so to win urkel fucking built a jet pack what jim t-shirt

370
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:49,200
travis what is the relevance of this anecdote no i suddenly just started thinking about that's

371
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:54,320
fucking cheating what are we teaching our children yeah yeah it's like that one physical prowess out

372
00:39:54,320 --> 00:40:00,400
the window just fucking cheat in these fucking teen sitcoms the writers were eventually like

373
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:06,080
well the the the challenges of high school are getting kind of boring let's have them beat the

374
00:40:06,080 --> 00:40:14,400
shit out of each other can we get duffy in the mix that was a weird crossover episode where uh

375
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:20,480
corey fought patrick duffy patrick duffy that's a quote that patrick duffy would say i mean say

376
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:29,760
his own name because he's a pokemon patrick duffy patrick duffy duffy pat pat pat pat pat pat pat

377
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:45,040
patrick duffy duffy use chop duffy duffy use acting patrick duffy duffy hasn't learned this

378
00:40:45,040 --> 00:40:52,400
duffy only has room for four moves he knows chop chopping chop they're saying patrick duffy top eat

379
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:58,320
drugs and walk just forget jumping over the general lee forget that skill you don't need

380
00:40:58,320 --> 00:41:08,080
it anymore duff he refuses you never know okay fine boy that's a fucking bitter pill when uh

381
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:15,840
you do not get the cat the call to uh reunite in the new iteration of dallas that's got to be

382
00:41:15,840 --> 00:41:21,840
bitter when uh even larry hagman's getting the call brink of death's door and then proceeding

383
00:41:21,840 --> 00:41:27,120
through death's door larry hagman gets the call to be on the new dallas and you patrick duffy

384
00:41:27,120 --> 00:41:32,720
the the phone just quiet quiet as i'll get out he's he's busy writing his one-man stage show

385
00:41:33,600 --> 00:41:37,200
he he wouldn't have time for it anyways you guys wouldn't understand the life of a professional

386
00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:40,560
actor but he's pretty busy and he would have turned him down if they called him anyways

387
00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:46,240
do you think every time patrick duffy's life has taken a turn for the worse which i imagine

388
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:51,600
has pretty much has been constantly since step by step one off the air that he's just waiting

389
00:41:51,600 --> 00:41:57,600
to like wake up and it was all a dream and he just like steps out of the shower and he's like

390
00:41:57,600 --> 00:42:05,440
patrick duffy and his wife is like no it's it's still it's still real life patrick duffy

391
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:13,920
it's still real life oh duffy have you guys seen and this is gonna one of the earliest uh

392
00:42:14,720 --> 00:42:19,840
one of the earliest like internet sensations was uh patrick duffy and the crab are you guys

393
00:42:19,840 --> 00:42:27,440
familiar with this this this had bypassed me for a long time but there is a series of videos

394
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:32,880
if you look out there on the internet about patrick duffy and his life with a stuffed crab

395
00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:38,560
puppet named the crab like in one episode the crab teaches patrick duffy about facebook and ringtones

396
00:42:39,520 --> 00:42:44,640
they watch top model together yeah this is a thing you could in one episode the crab dares patrick to

397
00:42:44,640 --> 00:42:49,680
eat a dime that that's just a thing you can watch on the internet is definitely gonna make a comeback

398
00:42:50,960 --> 00:42:54,880
i feel like duffy's like right on the edge i feel like he's on the cusp and i feel like we're doing

399
00:42:54,880 --> 00:42:59,760
the lord's work with this podcast this this duffy centric app if patrick duffy were a pokemon what

400
00:42:59,760 --> 00:43:04,720
type would it be because i would say fighting maybe psychic oh i was gonna say water based

401
00:43:04,720 --> 00:43:10,240
why is he water based because he he's able to elicit tears with the power of his act i guess

402
00:43:10,240 --> 00:43:17,680
that's true i would say electric because his fucking performance is since she's very sexual

403
00:43:17,680 --> 00:43:24,960
uh gen like genre of pokemon yeah he's a sex type sexual based sex type you sex tornado duffy

404
00:43:27,040 --> 00:43:33,200
dummy dummy dummy yeah you use evil of cereal sadly you don't know fucking duffy
