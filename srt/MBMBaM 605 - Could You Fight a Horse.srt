1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,820
The McElroy brothers are not experts and their advice should never be followed

2
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:10,580
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it

3
00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:17,660
Also, this show isn't for kids which I mentioned only so the babies out there will know how cool they are for listening

4
00:00:17,660 --> 00:00:30,660
What's up, you cool, baby?

5
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:50,420
It's better it's better

6
00:00:53,980 --> 00:00:55,980
It's better it's better

7
00:01:00,260 --> 00:01:02,260
Better it's better

8
00:01:10,900 --> 00:01:15,620
Hello everybody and welcome to my brother my brother and me an advice show for the margin era

9
00:01:15,620 --> 00:01:20,940
I'm your oldest brother Justin McElroy, and I am Travis McElroy the spookiest

10
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:26,980
I thought that Justin had pretty much planted his flag on Dracula Mountain

11
00:01:26,980 --> 00:01:32,220
You can't just no no one can just claim Dracula voice as their own. That's not okay

12
00:01:32,220 --> 00:01:36,420
That's fair, but I bring such a sensuality to it. You know to be fair

13
00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:41,260
I think Griffin's claimed it for Taz and I do think now in retrospect Justin has claimed it for my brother my brother and me

14
00:01:41,260 --> 00:01:44,060
I'm gonna claim that for till death do us part. I'm the only

15
00:01:44,060 --> 00:01:46,060
I think that's only that's only

16
00:01:46,980 --> 00:01:49,780
My name is Griffin McElroy and

17
00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:52,140
That's popcorn

18
00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:59,020
Popcorn that can only mean one thing let's all go to the movies. Hey, let's all go to the movies. Yeah

19
00:02:00,580 --> 00:02:03,100
Son of the Hedgehog 2 nope nope

20
00:02:04,100 --> 00:02:07,780
We can't we actually can't do that because I'm genuinely very fucking

21
00:02:07,780 --> 00:02:14,660
Yeah, but there's no reason you can't be stoked and also do a watch we don't do watches for movies that were not so

22
00:02:14,660 --> 00:02:16,660
I mean let me ask you a question

23
00:02:17,060 --> 00:02:23,700
Why are there no vampire movies? Why are there no superhero movies right well good news Justin?

24
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:28,580
Don't even fucking worry about it. You worry worry. Yeah, you do you dumb ass

25
00:02:28,700 --> 00:02:34,580
You don't need to worry about that shit anymore because now we got us a superhero vampire no not blade

26
00:02:34,580 --> 00:02:40,060
Huh, you know no you silly boy not blade not the daywalker why uh?

27
00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:47,980
Checks notes Morbius of course Morbius Morbius is here, and oh man his teeth are very sharp, and it is Jared Leto

28
00:02:49,180 --> 00:02:51,740
Jared Leto, and did you know it's a it's a

29
00:02:52,580 --> 00:02:54,580
autobiography of

30
00:02:55,100 --> 00:03:02,500
Mr.. Leto and his life and his challenges his blood disorder and the magical means he went about getting

31
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:06,620
Dracula powers to fix it somebody saw Jared Leto

32
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:13,620
In his turn as the Joker and said we should put that guy in more superhero movies

33
00:03:13,620 --> 00:03:17,460
This is what this is what this is what this is where it's hard for me

34
00:03:17,460 --> 00:03:22,260
This is where I struggle because Jared Leto appeared in the Suicide Squad

35
00:03:22,580 --> 00:03:26,220
Yeah, everyone said that sucks that sucks

36
00:03:26,220 --> 00:03:33,060
Let's give him also not only sucked on-screen, but ask anyone who apparently has ever worked with him sucked off-screen

37
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:37,740
Yeah, all around it. I'm not here to delve into the lives of our Hollywood stars

38
00:03:37,740 --> 00:03:41,260
We should be happy for whatever they give us now. We save that

39
00:03:42,100 --> 00:03:47,180
Questioning beyond judgment. Oh yeah, okay, okay, so Jared Leto is in

40
00:03:48,100 --> 00:03:52,420
Suicide Squad everybody's like bad job. Let's give him one more try

41
00:03:52,420 --> 00:03:57,460
Yeah, and then he's in Birds of Prey, and it's and and in that one

42
00:03:57,460 --> 00:04:04,620
They're like we actually are going to cut these parts out like we're not actually not going to use these parts because it's pretty

43
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:07,460
It's pretty rough actually we would like you to go

44
00:04:07,900 --> 00:04:15,340
We've got new Joker, and we'd like you to go please yes, and and Marvel sees this and is like well

45
00:04:15,820 --> 00:04:20,840
We do have one we don't really care about they called Jared and said hey Jared when God

46
00:04:20,840 --> 00:04:24,800
Closes the door technically this would be Sony. Yes, not not Marvel

47
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:31,240
This is a Sony spider-verse Sony was browsing through the thrift shop and made themselves a pickup of mr.

48
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:36,840
Leto, and they said fresh off house of gutsy get over here friend. You're a vampire now

49
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:43,160
That's the gutsy right over here on the left hand side left hand side. Thank you so much Jared

50
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:46,360
So now the film you're a vampire right? What's the film?

51
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:49,160
I see

52
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:50,800
a

53
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:56,880
Good Jared Leto joke that is a good Jared Leto joke. What is Morbius about you ask well?

54
00:04:57,120 --> 00:05:03,520
It's about on it's the Sony spider-verse, and it's about a superhero. Who's a bit of a bad boy

55
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:06,960
Bit of a loose cannon. He's out there

56
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,080
At night doing some spooky stuff scaring the people

57
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:15,440
Urges I know what you're thinking. I've heard about that one. No. This is a different one

58
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:20,960
Because this one is not starring Tom Hardy this one's trying Jared Leto, and that's the main difference

59
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:24,200
Yeah, I wish it was another venom movie

60
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:28,400
Jared Harris is in this you remember too many Jared's well

61
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:34,360
This is Jared Harris is the is you remember him? He's a great actor from Mad Men and many other things

62
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:36,440
the crown

63
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:43,280
Fringe my favorite my favorite film critic Mark Kermit said that Jared Leto has never been the best actor and now

64
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:46,440
In more because he's not even the best Jared nice

65
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:53,900
But listen, okay, no you listen. No you listen. I'm looking at the rotten tomatoes page

66
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:58,860
Don't here's it. Let's not put a number on now. It's not a number. This is just an idea. No

67
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:01,300
It's not a number government. It's the Scorpius

68
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:09,320
The this is a quote from Ian Simmons the further I get from it the more its flaws seem crippling

69
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:16,840
But I admire the spirit that Espinosa and company brought to the project which I'm convinced was nearly destroyed by a meddlesome and cowardly

70
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:19,880
Studio that is a positive that is one of the positive

71
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:30,840
Now we all know that he got way too method when he's playing the Joker and listen like

72
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:36,520
You can judge him all you want but talk to Paul Dano and like we know how twisted that shit can get

73
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:42,240
Yeah, so I'm willing to forgive that but all of Paul Dano's was inside his head and made his head hot where Jared Leto's

74
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:47,280
Was like I'm gonna put some fish places or whatever like yeah. Yeah, I'm gonna yeah exactly

75
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:52,440
I'm gonna I'm gonna kill that person's dog my co-star, but it's because I'm the Joker. I'm its method

76
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:59,860
Didn't even let me finish my point. Okay. Go ahead in this one. He got method by

77
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:02,720
His character has a blood disorder

78
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:07,880
Disorder uh-huh that gives him chronic pain and so to stay in character

79
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:12,520
He would use he would walk around on crutches very slowly everywhere on set

80
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:15,160
and

81
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:19,960
It and the bathroom breaks were taking a very long time and so they

82
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:25,680
This is a real one is an interview. I'm looking at with Daniel Espinosa the director of

83
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:32,480
Morbius in theaters now and so they put him in a wheelchair to get him around faster to the bathroom

84
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:34,780
and I don't and I that's and I see

85
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:41,440
Nothing wrong with that. Yeah, there's no problems with it. And in fact, it's sort of excuse that away. Mr

86
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:46,140
Espinosa the director of respondent said hey, man, it's people's processes. It's not though

87
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:49,000
Hey, man. Hey, man. Hey, hey, man's

88
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:55,040
Man and man, it's people's processes. So you but that's like saying like oh that guy

89
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:59,840
Yeah, he's uh on he works construction and every day before he builds the wall

90
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:04,560
He squishes a frog in his bare hands. It's really fun. Do you have it?

91
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:10,260
So it's process to build that wall without one squished frog

92
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:15,240
It's just I kind of am starting to get

93
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:23,200
What people who aren't white guys are saying? Oh, okay feels like this is hold on. Wait

94
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:29,440
This is the moment. I feel like Jared Leto is what really helped me to recognize the idea of privilege

95
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:31,440
Oh, yeah, but it's something good

96
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:36,920
it's just it seems like we keep he keeps like he gets the bat and

97
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:39,920
Then he drops the bat and he picks it back up

98
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:45,640
Yeah, and he eats the bat and they're like someone get this guy another bat or rabbit

99
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:50,600
Let's turn him into a bat in Morbius in theaters now. Thank you Sony Pictures

100
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:56,760
Jared Leto, this is great because there's a Venn diagram happening here Jared Leto helping Justin realize

101
00:08:57,020 --> 00:09:04,440
What everyone's saying about white guys and also helping me like lose a little bit of my strength in defending actors

102
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:09,600
When people are like actors are so out of touch and they're fucking shitty and it's like no man

103
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:13,440
Like they're people just like us they're stars. They're just like us they're doing it and they're like, what about Jared Leto?

104
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:15,640
I'm like, well fuck. Okay. Well fuck. Yeah

105
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:21,600
He has kept in a big white egg pod but between films where he can just dream his wonderful dreams

106
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:27,480
Jared Leto uses his acting career as an excuse to indulge in his real love being an asshole

107
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:30,960
Being a big big butthole everywhere. He goes

108
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:36,600
Hey, who the fuck is Morbius though? Because I know a lot of shit about comics and nerd shit

109
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:43,800
I don't know this dude from Adam who is more black at you don't know him from black out from black out. Who is Morbius?

110
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:46,480
Well, you know Griffin how in Batman

111
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:52,480
Somebody who thought it was really funny said what if Batman fought a guy named man bat, right?

112
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:56,320
Yeah, and then somebody said that's not funny. It's super fucking cool

113
00:09:56,320 --> 00:10:01,240
And now spider-man has one of those tunings called Morbius, but it's not man spider

114
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:08,560
No, that's that does exist though. Don't get it twisted. Okay, but not in this one in this one

115
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:12,040
He is Dracula and is there a scene where he fights?

116
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:17,280
This the sweet Tom Holland boy. No, this is not that he's in the venom verse

117
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:25,680
Which does cross over in the multiverse, but it's not the same versus the Tom Holland verse God Almighty. I love it

118
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:28,160
I love all this nerd shit. Hey guys

119
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:31,120
and

120
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:35,120
I'm talking to everybody not my brothers cuz they get they get this I get yeah

121
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:42,600
This is the royal guys vampires are bad. Yeah, like can we stop like?

122
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:44,600
Yeah, do you mean they're evil or they're dumb?

123
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:46,880
They're evil

124
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:48,880
They kill people for food

125
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:53,800
This is true, this is it drives me up a wall with this

126
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:59,800
What's the dead woke culture trying to fucking defend these?

127
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:06,400
Vampire yeah someone with the likeability and charisma of a journalist. I know what you're trying to do

128
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:13,200
Yeah, we get it. We get it, right? It's like it's like when they made Jim Carrey. Dr. Eggman

129
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:18,200
Yeah, they're trying to make me think he's very funny and silly and he's not he's the bad guy

130
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:24,140
Stop tricking of they made that Pattinson fellow another Batman

131
00:11:24,140 --> 00:11:29,900
But he didn't vamp out once in that whole way. I watch it and it's three hours long

132
00:11:30,020 --> 00:11:34,460
There was plenty of time in which he could have been a vampire at one point. That's ridiculous

133
00:11:34,460 --> 00:11:36,980
And can I tell you guys something just as I know about Batman?

134
00:11:37,580 --> 00:11:42,300
Wait, wait Travis Travis Travis. You have subjected us over the last week in pre-recording times

135
00:11:42,300 --> 00:11:46,660
Yes, special times the only time that we really check in on each other on a personal level

136
00:11:47,060 --> 00:11:51,580
Telling us about how you do not like that. I don't want to hear how you like the Batman

137
00:11:51,580 --> 00:11:55,380
I don't know. This is one thing. This is so important. I don't actually it's so important

138
00:11:55,380 --> 00:12:01,340
The movie is okay. Wait, if we let you do this then we get we get something in the future. Yeah

139
00:12:01,340 --> 00:12:02,940
Do you like this is all right

140
00:12:02,940 --> 00:12:09,100
Actively don't want you to talk about Batman and how you don't know Batman, please the Batman on the on the podcast

141
00:12:09,220 --> 00:12:11,380
So like that means like in the future

142
00:12:11,380 --> 00:12:16,060
I'm gonna want to talk about some shit that you guys aren't gonna want to hear about but I will get to

143
00:12:16,060 --> 00:12:22,140
Well, no juice you'll have one too you get a you get one, too. Okay, so if you want to talk about cash solitaire

144
00:12:22,740 --> 00:12:27,060
And how like deep in the pockets you are then you can do that

145
00:12:27,780 --> 00:12:32,340
And I'll find some I don't know. I'll find some you know, but it has to be as short as this thing

146
00:12:32,340 --> 00:12:36,540
I'm about to tell you. Yeah, it feels like the preamble may have extended this bit longer

147
00:12:36,540 --> 00:12:42,220
All right, let's hear it movie is three hours long and they have the gall to then also have a post-credits scene

148
00:12:42,220 --> 00:12:48,780
So how do you how do you make one has but you have a three-hour movie and then you're like

149
00:12:48,780 --> 00:12:53,820
But we couldn't squeeze this in before so now it goes it's out. It is to me Griffin

150
00:12:53,820 --> 00:12:58,740
They expect me to sit through the credits after a three-hour long movie to see 30 seconds when I know YouTube exists

151
00:12:58,740 --> 00:13:02,220
They won't you walk out with a sweet treat in your mouth my butt

152
00:13:02,860 --> 00:13:07,140
Okay. Well, I didn't make the decision. So why I can't wait to see Morbius

153
00:13:07,140 --> 00:13:15,340
Why not Morpheus or Mobius when they make a second one? Will it be M. Oh our EBS? Oh, that's good

154
00:13:15,380 --> 00:13:16,540
Yeah

155
00:13:16,540 --> 00:13:19,180
Do you it does Tom Hardy make an appearance in this one?

156
00:13:19,180 --> 00:13:24,900
Cuz that would be the thing that would actually pull me into the theater if there is a Tom Hardy slash Venom cameo

157
00:13:25,540 --> 00:13:30,460
I'm I'm in because there's a moment in the trailer. I don't know if you guys saw this where

158
00:13:31,380 --> 00:13:35,860
They're like, who are you and he's like, I'm Venom and like scares guys like now I'm just kidding

159
00:13:35,860 --> 00:13:41,300
It's fucking hilarious to be we used to do jokes about the movies

160
00:13:41,300 --> 00:13:45,860
And now I feel like Travis is just sort of like talking movie. Like he's just he's just talking

161
00:13:45,860 --> 00:13:49,620
What jokes could you make about a vampire doctor who saves people and fights crime?

162
00:13:50,380 --> 00:13:54,500
My wife didn't agree with that by the way. Oh because because of

163
00:13:55,060 --> 00:13:59,500
The fact that he's a doctor who also does vampire stuff. Yeah. Yeah, I was so upset that

164
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:05,020
She doesn't want to see Morbius or at least I'm assuming that's the reason

165
00:14:05,020 --> 00:14:09,660
Yeah, she keeps hurting me. She keeps saying no, no, no, no, no not with a million

166
00:14:10,420 --> 00:14:13,860
Not for a million dollars not with my worst enemy's eyes. No. Yeah

167
00:14:15,380 --> 00:14:20,260
Because it's a doctor that hurts people well, there is that great line in it because I did see it opening night

168
00:14:20,900 --> 00:14:28,860
Where he like eats someone's fucking neck meat and they die instantly and some bystanders like what about the Hippocratic oath?

169
00:14:28,860 --> 00:14:33,140
And he's like what about the Hippocratic both of these nuts?

170
00:14:33,140 --> 00:14:36,380
And then he bites them twice and they die from on the nuts

171
00:14:38,420 --> 00:14:41,300
Yeah, he buys some twice on the nuts Morbius ate my balls

172
00:14:44,340 --> 00:14:47,780
Is there a specific line in the Hippocratic oath about not

173
00:14:48,380 --> 00:14:54,680
Vampiring people. I mean, it's pretty I mean, it's it says do no harm. It's pretty I think that that's a blanket

174
00:14:55,220 --> 00:14:58,100
covers what if it was the only way to save their life to

175
00:14:59,260 --> 00:15:01,260
Harm them to turn them. Oh

176
00:15:01,260 --> 00:15:04,340
I got to turn them to save their life

177
00:15:04,980 --> 00:15:11,520
I'll give them the eternal curse, but they'll live and that's what matters is Morbius out there making other Morbiuses

178
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:14,860
He's right. I know I know Sony's not

179
00:15:25,140 --> 00:15:29,380
See you this weekend at the birthday party for Morbius

180
00:15:29,380 --> 00:15:35,900
Two weeks old today I think we love you so much Morbius. Happy birthday. It's a special day

181
00:15:36,580 --> 00:15:42,580
So excited about Morbius can't wait but more excited about helping people because that's our that's our thing. Oh

182
00:15:44,780 --> 00:15:49,580
Elon bought Twitter by the way, if I can just oh my god. Okay, this is gonna be your thing

183
00:15:50,340 --> 00:15:52,460
No, I'm not. Okay

184
00:15:53,140 --> 00:15:56,260
That cuz that's been my problem with Twitter. Yeah

185
00:15:56,260 --> 00:15:58,260
I

186
00:15:58,460 --> 00:16:03,500
Not enough you on not enough people like you are yeah, okay

187
00:16:05,100 --> 00:16:07,100
I'm not on Twitter anymore

188
00:16:07,460 --> 00:16:09,460
Bullshit, I'm not

189
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:17,060
These don't do you passively do Twitter? Oh, no, I'm not like I'm just like not I'll dip dip in

190
00:16:17,060 --> 00:16:22,660
Yeah, that's what yeah, it'd be wild not to dip in you gotta dip in I gotta find out what the celebs are doing

191
00:16:22,660 --> 00:16:28,500
I'm planning to propose to my long-term girlfriend on April 9th on April 8th

192
00:16:29,140 --> 00:16:31,260
Sonic the Hedgehog comes out in theaters

193
00:16:31,620 --> 00:16:37,540
How bad of an idea would it be to see the movie with her on opening night the night before I proposed to her?

194
00:16:38,220 --> 00:16:40,280
She I'm does he okay

195
00:16:40,280 --> 00:16:45,220
Go she is resigned to the fact that she will be seeing this movie with me and wouldn't describe herself as a fan

196
00:16:45,580 --> 00:16:47,380
These would be on two different days

197
00:16:47,380 --> 00:16:52,940
But the proximity of seeing Sonic and Knuckles clash it out less than 24 hours for half of the question might tie the two memories

198
00:16:52,940 --> 00:16:56,100
Together this from Eddie now listen at first blush

199
00:16:56,100 --> 00:16:57,740
I see where you're like, I think it's fine

200
00:16:57,740 --> 00:17:04,320
But now imagine it's like a decade later and people are asking the question like what was the proposal like?

201
00:17:04,660 --> 00:17:07,340
Okay, and how odd like eventually

202
00:17:07,980 --> 00:17:11,800
That story is going to be so the night after we saw Sonic the Hedgehog tear

203
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:17,320
We what you'll do is you'll do that to figure out the date, right? You'll say let's see Sonic the Hedgehog

204
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:22,440
Came out it too came on April 8th. I remember so we got engaged in April 9th, right?

205
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:24,440
This is what I'm saying so eventually it will become

206
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:28,720
inextricably linked yeah to watching the two powerhouses

207
00:17:29,560 --> 00:17:31,560
Sonic and Knuckles

208
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:37,560
Miles Prowler president, let's not rule out mr.. Tails you say Prowler. Yeah, that's what it is

209
00:17:37,560 --> 00:17:43,080
No, it's miles Prowler Travis. It's a pun. Are you sure it's not miles Prowler? I thought it's Prowler

210
00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:47,400
I know it's per hour. I know it's miles per hour, and that's the joke, but I thought it was Prowler

211
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:53,480
Okay, well it couldn't be less important, but I love that

212
00:17:54,320 --> 00:18:00,320
You know all of these considerations, and there's a considerable. You're right Griffin. I'm sorry. No yeah, I know of course

213
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:02,080
I'm right um

214
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:06,080
that the that the idea of watching Sonic the Hedgehog to

215
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:08,080
later

216
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:13,000
Did not yeah, that is not not an option not an option

217
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:19,240
We're going opening night gotta see Sonic if anything actually makes more sense to me to propose at

218
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:23,560
Sonic then to move. I mean if it's gonna be linked

219
00:18:24,040 --> 00:18:31,280
Link link it how about this okay? How about this okay into Sonic the Hedgehog 2 I've not seen it

220
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:33,280
It's not out yet, but this might be how it is

221
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:40,560
Fuckin dr. Robotnik dead big robot not dead kick Sonic so hard and his rings come shoot

222
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:42,640
Oh, I love where this is going. I know where it's going

223
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:48,720
I love he's like and then he sits up and like miles per hour by which I mean tails is dead

224
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:53,560
And that's a spoiler so sorry looking at his dead corpse, and he's like

225
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:59,160
I'm so sorry tails. I couldn't finish the fight if only I had

226
00:18:59,160 --> 00:19:04,520
another ring and then he looks out at the audience uh-huh and

227
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:10,880
You're down on one knee, and he's like girth. Could you help me out? Yeah? It's girth. It's Eddie

228
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:12,880
It's right there in the question, but that's okay

229
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:19,240
Eddie girth and you go by girth Eddie girth. Yeah, and girth's like I got a ring

230
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:24,660
But I can't give it to you Sonic because it's going to my beloved. Will you miss me and then Sonic's like

231
00:19:24,660 --> 00:19:26,660
Oh fuck

232
00:19:26,740 --> 00:19:30,620
And then your girlfriend now fiance has to fight dr. Robotnik

233
00:19:30,660 --> 00:19:37,540
Well, or you know like that's the end of the movie and in your very special screening of Sonic the Hedgehog 2

234
00:19:38,140 --> 00:19:44,580
Why won't they know what if this wasn't a special screening? Why don't they have it in more movies? Yeah?

235
00:19:46,020 --> 00:19:48,740
In more movies there should be a special

236
00:19:49,460 --> 00:19:53,900
There should be a special built-in generic proposal invitation

237
00:19:53,900 --> 00:19:57,980
Hi Dr. Morbius the vampire. I'm going to kill you, but first

238
00:19:57,980 --> 00:19:59,980
I think someone here has a

239
00:20:00,140 --> 00:20:06,140
Special question to ask and that's also gonna leave it open to other things too right like we don't have to just leave it

240
00:20:06,140 --> 00:20:11,680
Like I think someone has something important to say and then it could be like I quit or you know

241
00:20:12,780 --> 00:20:16,380
Yeah, yes your mother, and I are getting a divorce

242
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:22,780
Yeah, that would be dope why isn't that in this is this is all this is all

243
00:20:22,780 --> 00:20:25,260
I don't think there's any problem

244
00:20:26,940 --> 00:20:33,020
But I I hope I hope she's not a listener of our podcast because she now knows with 100%

245
00:20:33,020 --> 00:20:40,260
That's okay. This won't come out until two days after then oh, that's a good point. Yeah, Eddie. Let us know how it went yeah

246
00:20:41,340 --> 00:20:46,980
Yes, maybe and Google like what's the shortest engagement in history and

247
00:20:48,020 --> 00:20:50,940
Call up you know the Guinness Book and all that

248
00:20:50,940 --> 00:20:52,220
um God

249
00:20:52,220 --> 00:20:57,500
I can't wait to see Sonic I didn't realize it was so close Henry has been asking about this fucking film

250
00:20:57,780 --> 00:21:01,020
Since the first trailer came out a hundred years

251
00:21:01,020 --> 00:21:06,720
I mean technically he's been asking about it since the after-credits scene of Sonic 1 when Tails miles per hour flies out of the portal

252
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:11,540
And he's like don't worry Sonic. I'm on my way and Henry's like who the fuck is that I'm like

253
00:21:11,540 --> 00:21:13,540
I am way into this

254
00:21:13,580 --> 00:21:17,800
Sonic's best buddy, and he's like what why isn't he in this movie?

255
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:21,980
I was like oh, he'll probably be in the next movie, and then I was like why the fuck did I say that out loud?

256
00:21:22,380 --> 00:21:27,660
And then for the last what year and a half. It's just been let's get there get there. Why haven't they made it?

257
00:21:27,660 --> 00:21:33,580
Why haven't they made it yet? Tell them to hurry tell Jim Carrey to hurry hurry knuckles. You're supposed to be fast Sonic

258
00:21:33,580 --> 00:21:35,580
What the fuck can I?

259
00:21:35,820 --> 00:21:37,740
Do you guys want to talk to the wizard?

260
00:21:37,740 --> 00:21:40,300
Yeah, like I'd like we don't have to know

261
00:21:41,380 --> 00:21:45,740
I just I always feel so formal addressing the wizard is the wizard

262
00:21:45,740 --> 00:21:49,500
And I just wish we were on a first-name basis at this point. Oh, Kenneth. Oh

263
00:21:50,660 --> 00:21:56,020
Yeah, hey, what's the frequency Kenneth? Oh, I bet he hates that fuck. Yeah, and I just changed his name

264
00:22:00,260 --> 00:22:06,340
How to fake food poisoning Megan sent this in thanks Megan and food poisoning can strike at any time making this the perfect illness to

265
00:22:06,340 --> 00:22:08,340
Imitate if you need to get out of work or school

266
00:22:08,380 --> 00:22:11,480
Symptoms are relatively easy to impersonate including things like nausea

267
00:22:11,480 --> 00:22:16,800
Vomiting and stomach pain as long as you set the stage fake the illness correctly and provide proof when it is necessary

268
00:22:17,080 --> 00:22:19,760
Gross, you should be enjoying a free day to yourself

269
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:22,360
now I

270
00:22:22,360 --> 00:22:28,800
One one little thing there. They do only list the physical symptoms of food poisoning and not

271
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:34,040
Just kind of the emotional ones of like this is gonna be forever. Is this forever?

272
00:22:34,040 --> 00:22:37,680
I don't remember a time where I wasn't shitting and puking and

273
00:22:37,680 --> 00:22:43,360
I set my little TV by the body. It's like super gross. Yeah, okay. I'll try to

274
00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:46,160
There is also the the

275
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:52,100
Emotional response of like all food has betrayed me. I thought you were my friend. I'll never look at you again. Yeah

276
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:54,600
Did I even eat this much food?

277
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:59,900
Talk about stomach issues if you've had stomach issues in the past or claim to have a weak stomach try to make it more believable

278
00:22:59,900 --> 00:23:03,320
When you claim to be suffering food poisoning, so this is a long con that I've been setting up

279
00:23:03,320 --> 00:23:07,640
Professionally for over a decade now. So like y'all know my

280
00:23:08,520 --> 00:23:11,480
journey or quote-unquote journey. Oh

281
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:17,280
I'm ironclad. You're not you don't really have the delicate constitution of the boy from Secret Garden

282
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:18,400
No

283
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:24,680
So when I run to the bathroom twice before like when Paul starts his announcements before a live show

284
00:23:24,680 --> 00:23:28,160
Yeah, I have to go run to the potty before the show even starts

285
00:23:28,160 --> 00:23:35,200
Um, that's I'm actually playing with toys. I'm like fun and like doing my own stuff

286
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:40,840
Yeah, like a body leisure. Well, I'll go in the potty just so you all think that I'm being sick

287
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:46,520
But really I'm not I never have I actually think I'll be more convincing

288
00:23:47,040 --> 00:23:53,520
To brag about your iron stomach and like how you never get sick. So then when it happens, you're like what the fuck

289
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:58,480
What is it? Oh my god. Oh, is this how you guys feel all the time? Oh, oh

290
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:02,200
Like I think to me that's like, oh, this is serious. He never yeah

291
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:05,960
Invent a dicey dining situation

292
00:24:05,960 --> 00:24:10,320
You don't actually have to go out to eat but if you tell your but if you tell your classmates co-workers and boss you're going

293
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:15,800
To eat somewhere likely to cause food poisoning. That'll make it more believable when it happens. I'm going to stinky Rick's dirty plates

294
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:22,600
Yeah, I say that before is that like setting up the the fiction, okay

295
00:24:23,240 --> 00:24:27,600
Because they have like day-old escargot over there that they sell for like 50%

296
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:32,000
I cannot like a half-inch of standing water everywhere

297
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:36,120
Love it. It's a great UP. You should do that more often

298
00:24:36,120 --> 00:24:43,840
I like I like to go when I'm at the office all sometimes announce like my great-grandaunt's been like so sick lately

299
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:48,040
Wait, and then hold on set up the scene. Are you talking to like Jim or Pam or Dwight or?

300
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:53,520
Whole the whole gang is as always hanging on my every word

301
00:24:53,520 --> 00:25:00,600
Okay, Andy and I had just finished our office lottery, which has gotten us into more than a few scrapes

302
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:03,960
Okay, and was there an acapella moment between you and Andy?

303
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:06,120
Yeah

304
00:25:06,120 --> 00:25:08,120
It's like be

305
00:25:08,120 --> 00:25:14,920
24 we would like sing. Yeah, and Angela because she doesn't like the fun just so fucking me in the whole game

306
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:19,380
Margaret Kevin. Yeah, that's now the whole

307
00:25:20,040 --> 00:25:27,080
Kareem creed creed is there. Of course. Kareem Abdul-Jabbar is there when you join the office. They're hanging on my every word

308
00:25:27,080 --> 00:25:29,960
Yeah, I'm telling them about how my great-grandaunt is

309
00:25:30,560 --> 00:25:37,080
Very sick, huh? And then I just sort of leave it and then when I need a break alone later, she's really sick

310
00:25:37,080 --> 00:25:39,640
I deploy. Yeah, that's fun

311
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:46,680
It's not but because it's a sad thing when it does, you know, eventually real though. She's not real

312
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:51,680
Okay, what do you tell them that too when you say that she's dead so they don't feel bad

313
00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:55,560
No, it's okay. They won't really feel bad. That's great

314
00:25:55,560 --> 00:25:57,680
And if you sleuth it out and they'll be like, hey

315
00:25:57,680 --> 00:26:03,080
I did some sleuthing and your grand man is not real and you'd be like, yeah, she got erased from the timeline

316
00:26:03,080 --> 00:26:09,040
Oh boy, so it's sad but don't like feel bad about it or anything. They won't feel bad about it because I'm the office bad boy

317
00:26:09,080 --> 00:26:15,720
Yeah, well you didn't say that before. They think that I'm too hard to have emotions and then at the end

318
00:26:16,040 --> 00:26:17,640
Pam is like

319
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:24,160
Sees me crying. I'm like out on the dock. Yeah with Daryl and some of the other guys and they leave and she sees me

320
00:26:24,160 --> 00:26:27,080
I'm sitting there crying and she falls in love with you

321
00:26:27,080 --> 00:26:33,320
Your granddad with me instead of instead of Jim and Pam jam now, it's Justin and Pam jam

322
00:26:34,280 --> 00:26:40,320
Just him and you can be like she'd be like, well, I'm so sorry your grandma guy erased from the timeline

323
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:42,320
You'd be like, yeah, she looked at the orb

324
00:26:47,240 --> 00:26:51,560
But then she's like I wouldn't much rather sleep with you than Jim what are you doing?

325
00:26:51,560 --> 00:26:55,600
Yeah, and then you'd be like, I can't do that right now. I have for Christ

326
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:57,840
I have to go smash the orb. Yeah

327
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:04,480
Can I come to but then he vanishes and I'm like you're not gonna remember this

328
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:10,080
Change everything. Yeah, fuck dude, but it's always been you

329
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:14,380
And you kiss and no we don't it's chased. It's a chase

330
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:21,120
Because if if I selling myself with a touch of a woman the time gods won't let me through the street

331
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:28,680
Yeah, yeah basics. The orb can only be smashed by someone pure of heart and genitals. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah

332
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:32,880
Man, who's never achieved an erection is the only one

333
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:36,040
People give the sixth season of the office a lot of shit

334
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:42,040
Yeah, cuz like people like it wasn't funny anymore into after Steve Carell left. It's like well, maybe it wasn't funny anymore

335
00:27:42,040 --> 00:27:44,040
But it has some stuff to say

336
00:27:44,040 --> 00:27:50,360
The challenging shit, they talk a lot about purity and not just like don't have sex

337
00:27:50,360 --> 00:27:55,680
But like no physical contact of any kind from birth. Yeah, and like

338
00:27:56,320 --> 00:28:01,200
That kind of like it says a lot about the indulgences of our culture

339
00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:01,920
Yeah

340
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:08,000
Because that one character who had never had soda or any kind of spicy foods or the touch of another human being

341
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:13,920
And that's up for didn't didn't recognize Halloween or didn't recognize Halloween or even the days of the week

342
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:16,240
Yeah, and like just saw time

343
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:24,040
Continuous bubble and they're the only ones who could touch the time or that said a lot I think about like consumerism

344
00:28:24,520 --> 00:28:25,920
Yes

345
00:28:25,920 --> 00:28:29,480
Yes, yes. Yes, and when Kevin started wearing a robe and

346
00:28:30,120 --> 00:28:34,040
Said he couldn't work at the office anymore because he was the Chronicle of Gonzo law, right?

347
00:28:34,040 --> 00:28:41,800
Yeah, he was the only one that could protect the sacred texts. Yeah, I was his consciousness was in several different timelines at the same time

348
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:48,640
Yeah, and then there was that funny scene where he turned into an eagle in the office and then Dwight was like trying to get

349
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:54,320
Him like guys who let this he's like who let this eagle out in the office. Yeah, it's Kevin

350
00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:56,940
Don't don't get him and then Jim made it

351
00:28:56,940 --> 00:29:04,460
Okay, Kevin's gone the Kevin Union was a flesh prison for the true Chronicle of Gonzo lar whose knowledge cannot be bound by your

352
00:29:04,540 --> 00:29:09,740
Primitive paper and leather bound books. Yeah, he is one of all of us and part of the eternal consciousness

353
00:29:10,300 --> 00:29:14,460
And then Jim set Dwight's phone to Portuguese and like yeah

354
00:29:14,460 --> 00:29:18,420
I was like, how do I even and it ended up ripping a hole through existence?

355
00:29:18,420 --> 00:29:18,920
Yeah

356
00:29:18,920 --> 00:29:25,800
And then and then the Chronicle of Gonzo lar pecks out Andy's eyes and Jim looks at the camera like really yeah

357
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:27,800
It's not again

358
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:29,040
Yeah

359
00:29:29,040 --> 00:29:32,760
And he says like I always have and everybody fucking loses

360
00:29:32,760 --> 00:29:38,280
Yeah, and then Andy has to make the multi-year pilgrimage to the fountains of Felicina. Yeah restore

361
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:45,360
Yeah, yeah, but he ends up a second sight and he can see on seeing and it's a we remember we remember yeah

362
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:49,920
We all remember these classic seats for the off. Yeah, I forget what we were. Oh, I was doing a wiki out

363
00:29:49,920 --> 00:29:51,920
Oh

364
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:59,400
Use likely food is the scapegoat things like poultry meat fish and eggs earlier in the article

365
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:02,840
It says that I like to imagine four people in their car listening to the show

366
00:30:02,840 --> 00:30:08,200
And then when something like that happens, they start like kind of chuckling but also looking at each other

367
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:12,440
Like is this a reference to something that I do not that I've never heard of

368
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:18,520
I always think of these moments when I picture someone saying like you got to listen to this show

369
00:30:18,520 --> 00:30:21,800
I've been telling you about and then they play that and they're like, I don't think I do

370
00:30:21,800 --> 00:30:25,440
I don't think I get it most of the time depending on the age of the person

371
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:29,280
I can just say oh, it's Twin Peaks. Oh, yeah, like they will let that slide

372
00:30:29,960 --> 00:30:35,400
Earlier in the article. It does say that certain foods like Mexican Indian and Chinese have a reputation for causing stomach issues

373
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:40,800
I would counter that by saying that the worst stomach issues I've ever had have been mostly because of salad

374
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:42,800
Yeah, that was not washed good

375
00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:51,120
So if it's less about the origin of the cuisine and rather the sort of dedication of the

376
00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:56,240
That's like that's always happened in to romaine. Like I need an excuse to not eat salad, right?

377
00:30:56,240 --> 00:31:01,280
Okay, don't try what I've done before which is like I think I had some bad bourbon and it doesn't work

378
00:31:03,920 --> 00:31:08,520
Broadcast your illness by telling your friends and family you're not feeling well in a Facebook post or tweet

379
00:31:08,520 --> 00:31:12,420
It's more likely people will believe you've got food poisoning. That's awesome

380
00:31:12,420 --> 00:31:17,360
For instance, you might say something like I'm gonna be on the down low for a day or two got food poisoning last night

381
00:31:17,680 --> 00:31:20,800
that's a classy way of doing it and not just like

382
00:31:21,280 --> 00:31:27,560
Tap tap tap 140 characters. If you all could if you all even knew my butt dot dot dot dot dot

383
00:31:28,360 --> 00:31:33,880
It's bad y'all dot dot dot dot. This might be the one and then you can skip work for a couple days

384
00:31:33,880 --> 00:31:39,960
It has it. Okay. Listen, just a quick edit here. You have to say like, yeah, I'm feeling pretty bad

385
00:31:39,960 --> 00:31:46,240
But work comes first and you got to make it like that school comes right and you need someone else to say to you like

386
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:51,600
No, man, take care of yourself. You gotta stay home and you're like, but I gotta finish those reports

387
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:56,720
It's like the reports can wait man. What's important is your house and then you need them to tell you to stay home

388
00:31:56,720 --> 00:31:59,000
So you seem like a real trooper, right?

389
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:01,440
Focus on symptoms difficult to verify

390
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:05,120
Stomach pain and nausea will be the two easiest conditions for you to imitate and the hardest to confirm

391
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:08,020
I would argue that with food poisoning anybody who wants you to

392
00:32:08,020 --> 00:32:09,740
verify

393
00:32:09,740 --> 00:32:11,740
uh-huh with

394
00:32:12,260 --> 00:32:14,260
peer reviewed evidence is

395
00:32:15,420 --> 00:32:20,780
Out of their fucking gourd or a boss at a business where you should not be working if they're like, oh, man

396
00:32:20,780 --> 00:32:23,740
My die-die is so bad and then they'll be like show me the die-die

397
00:32:24,260 --> 00:32:29,520
You know, you can't work at that business anymore. Show me the die-die. Do you guys remember that scene?

398
00:32:29,980 --> 00:32:35,420
This from the Jerry McGuire. Yeah, I remember that. Yeah. Yeah, it's fucking funny

399
00:32:35,420 --> 00:32:37,420
I don't

400
00:32:37,620 --> 00:32:41,980
Okay, keep your so much we did keep your sick call short when you're sick

401
00:32:41,980 --> 00:32:43,860
The last thing you want to do is make small talk over the phone

402
00:32:43,860 --> 00:32:47,060
This is actually a good point if you like to try to over explain it

403
00:32:47,940 --> 00:32:52,380
Then they're gonna know that something is wrong. Yeah, so you just want to hit him with like it

404
00:32:53,620 --> 00:32:55,300
Derek I

405
00:32:55,300 --> 00:32:59,220
Can't click and then like they'll be like, hey, where's Jeremy today?

406
00:32:59,220 --> 00:33:02,900
Like I got a weird whisper goes phone call earlier and even do it

407
00:33:02,900 --> 00:33:05,940
And it's great. If you have someone else in the house. I used to have dad

408
00:33:06,740 --> 00:33:10,060
calling to work sick for me a confederate

409
00:33:10,540 --> 00:33:16,100
The best buy like listen my son. It's me radios Clint McElroy the voice you can trust

410
00:33:20,780 --> 00:33:27,860
Can't do it today can't sell can't sell Netflix subscriptions. So I do it when you came back to work. I'm so worried

411
00:33:27,860 --> 00:33:29,860
Oh

412
00:33:30,780 --> 00:33:35,740
When they went back to work did you ever get was your boss ever like don't make your fucking dad

413
00:33:36,060 --> 00:33:41,740
Call us anymore. I don't want it. I don't want that pressure on me to speak to radios Clint McElroy. I get starstruck

414
00:33:41,740 --> 00:33:48,300
It's not fair. The power dynamics are off starstruck is and I promise I say like listen never again. Don't worry

415
00:33:48,300 --> 00:33:52,620
Oh my god, he called you. I'm so embarrassed guy. He just loves me so much

416
00:33:52,620 --> 00:33:57,940
I was just gonna shit at home and not call you cuz I'm kind of the office of bad boys, you know

417
00:33:57,940 --> 00:34:00,740
Ask Andy return to work under the weather

418
00:34:00,740 --> 00:34:06,060
This is the most important step in this whole article is that you do come back like a hero like a champion?

419
00:34:06,060 --> 00:34:11,340
Yeah, you should still be home. Are you kidding? This is what I'm saying? No, okay. No, wait. No, no, no

420
00:34:11,340 --> 00:34:18,300
So they're saying okay, so you're faking we're faking right now. Yeah, we're faking. Oh, that's the point. Okay. Sorry go on

421
00:34:18,300 --> 00:34:25,540
Okay, so we're faking right now that it we're so nervous about this fucking dragnet being pulled up around us

422
00:34:25,540 --> 00:34:27,980
That we're keeping our phone conversation short

423
00:34:27,980 --> 00:34:34,180
Uh-huh, but I'm supposed to go in and give a fucking Richard the third style like full

424
00:34:34,740 --> 00:34:41,580
Physicality performance of me soldiering through my food food poisoning. Is that what they're suggesting?

425
00:34:41,580 --> 00:34:47,060
But if you pull a Bueller on April 8th, uh-huh, and then you come back to go see Sonic

426
00:34:47,060 --> 00:34:52,980
Thank you, Travis for the joke that I was going to do. Oh, no, you just sort of saw you like

427
00:34:54,700 --> 00:35:01,200
Well, I didn't know you were heading there cuz I come back April 9th and you're Hale and Hardy they'll be like Sonic, right?

428
00:35:03,140 --> 00:35:08,020
Sonic cured you is an interesting angle that when I was not the way I was in

429
00:35:09,740 --> 00:35:15,940
Secret I went I did honestly shit myself silly when saw Sonic never felt better

430
00:35:15,940 --> 00:35:19,740
It saw Morbius on the 7th nearly fucking killed me

431
00:35:21,140 --> 00:35:22,860
Sonic 2 on the 8th

432
00:35:22,860 --> 00:35:27,800
Brought me raised me right back up brought me back man. One true one true Sonic. Yeah

433
00:35:28,220 --> 00:35:30,080
I've heard of two different critics by the way

434
00:35:30,080 --> 00:35:36,900
Both David Simms and Mark Kermode tweeted that they saw Morbius and then met some sort of physical calamity

435
00:35:38,580 --> 00:35:44,300
Kermode had a toothache and David Simms said he has stomachache after sit both tweeted about this after seeing Morpheus

436
00:35:44,300 --> 00:35:46,300
It is hurting people

437
00:35:47,140 --> 00:35:53,340
It's too far. It's not funny. It's hurting. It's hurting people. The movie is bad. It's hurting people now

438
00:35:53,340 --> 00:35:55,100
Here's that you have to go under though

439
00:35:55,100 --> 00:36:01,600
If if Jared Leto had agreed to participate in Batman in the candle nights like Ben Schwartz did

440
00:36:01,940 --> 00:36:04,340
Yeah, I have different things to say

441
00:36:06,540 --> 00:36:11,020
You'll never know sliding doors. Thank you. So let's roleplay this and Justin

442
00:36:11,020 --> 00:36:17,900
I want you to pin the email to Jared fucking Leto asking him to please do a bit on candle nights this special episode

443
00:36:18,460 --> 00:36:20,140
Dear Jared

444
00:36:20,140 --> 00:36:22,860
Dearest dearest Jared. Perfect. It's

445
00:36:23,660 --> 00:36:29,280
Justin McElroy. I do a podcast. I know that you are a bad person, but I hope that

446
00:36:30,340 --> 00:36:36,260
Even though you're a bad person you would be in candle nights, which is a charity event

447
00:36:37,380 --> 00:36:39,940
famous love that shit and you can be

448
00:36:39,940 --> 00:36:46,860
The Joker in it or Morbius, but please don't be Jared Leto again. I've heard a lot of different stuff

449

You can play music from your Mars Mars attacks your band. Yeah, that's fine

450

451
00:36:57,020 --> 00:37:02,660
Just don't be yourself. You could be Jeremy cool or whatever your character's name was in my so-called life

452
00:37:02,660 --> 00:37:05,580
I think it was Jeremy cool or perhaps Slater cool

453
00:37:05,580 --> 00:37:12,980
You can be Stanley Gucci if you want. It doesn't matter. You can be a Gucci if you would like to sir. Uncle Gucci?

457
00:37:31,660 --> 00:37:38,120
Terrible remote do strange things like move around on its own like scrolling through a video if you're trying to watch it

458
00:37:38,120 --> 00:37:39,080

459
00:37:39,080 --> 00:37:40,280

00:38:42,440 --> 00:38:48,280
Yeah, I want to talk about soft seamless tagless and luxuriously cozy feeling clothes

471
00:38:48,280 --> 00:38:55,120
Yeah, then you're talking about Bombas wait, really? Yeah, everything they make is soft seamless tagless and has a luxuriously

472
00:38:56,280 --> 00:39:02,480
Cozy feel I'm wearing their socks right now. I love wearing their socks. I'm excited because I have more of the short ones

474
00:39:05,400 --> 00:39:08,680
No shows, I guess you'd call them. Yeah, and I'm about to make the switch

475
00:39:09,520 --> 00:39:14,400
This weekend probably Saturday or Sunday depending on the weather. I'm about to take my

476
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:18,120

00:39:18,920 --> 00:39:20,920
Dump them into the drawer

Exciting the long socks in the tote bag

479
00:39:23,560 --> 00:39:28,680
That's how you know that spring is true when a young man's socks turn to no-shows

480
00:39:28,680 --> 00:39:30,280
But I don't want to talk about Bombas

481
00:39:30,280 --> 00:39:32,680
I want to talk about a company who has a simple mission

482
00:39:33,240 --> 00:39:38,720
That works to make the most comfortable clothes ever and then match every item sold with an equal item donated

483
00:39:39,360 --> 00:39:43,160
A company that when you buy from them, you know, you're also giving to someone in need, right?

484
00:39:43,160 --> 00:39:48,120
Do we yeah, that's a great try to drive this. That's Bombas. You're talking so embarrassing what? Yeah

00:40:04,760 --> 00:40:09,120
Okay, but one last thing I want to talk about a company that sells really super bulky underwear

489
00:40:09,120 --> 00:40:16,920
That's really uncomfortable and itchy and like sandpaper on your loins and like just just show like it's so obvious that it's there

490
00:40:17,560 --> 00:40:24,520
Then you're talking about the competition brand. Yeah. Oh, okay. Yeah, I just love big bulky itchy underpants

493
00:40:34,920 --> 00:40:40,280
Justin knowledge on this fool. No, but what did you just do cuz you were like, I know someone who can help out with that

494
00:40:40,640 --> 00:40:42,080
Hey, well, I was setting you up

495
00:40:42,080 --> 00:40:48,080
I flicked the foosball in the air and now you just have to swat it over the net that is well illegal

496
00:40:48,080 --> 00:40:52,660
That's an illegal maneuver Justin. No, you actually I table you hike

497
00:40:52,660 --> 00:40:57,440
Put too much crank in my spank and the foosball flip in the dang air talked about this Justin

498
00:40:57,440 --> 00:41:02,520
That's gonna get us to disqualified at regionals. It's a valid tactic. It is not valid

499
00:41:02,520 --> 00:41:08,880
Maybe all the streets maybe when you're playing three, you're doing a lot of foods, man. We're playing by the rules here

500
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:10,480
It's a league game

501
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:14,920
Twirl up you curl up your wrist put a bunch of fucking crank in your spank

502
00:41:14,920 --> 00:41:17,040
We don't play out and knock that ball clean into the air

503
00:41:17,040 --> 00:41:19,720
Listen, I know you can blow on it to adjust the trajectory

504
00:41:19,720 --> 00:41:26,280
You're the bad boy the bad boy of foosball just and I know that but we've talked about this that's gonna get us disqualified

505
00:41:26,280 --> 00:41:29,720
We're never gonna get that prize money to save the rec center

506
00:41:29,720 --> 00:41:35,720
Door dash is listening to this right now and they're like part of the fucking ad because these boys are wild

507
00:41:37,080 --> 00:41:40,380
Was that in there is the must-be-read verbatim part

508
00:41:43,160 --> 00:41:50,320
It says here ad-lib foosball skit so you guys did that and I'll tell you about door dash which is the thing I use

509
00:41:51,200 --> 00:41:57,880
Several times a week at this point to get delicious dinners and lunches and breakfasts is sent to my house

510
00:41:57,880 --> 00:42:00,920
But more often than not it's to get you know

511
00:42:02,040 --> 00:42:07,280
Medicines and an onion sent to my house because every time I go to the store

512
00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:12,800
I always forget an onion because I just assume we have them at home and we never do because we could also send an onion

513
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:17,680
To someone else's house as a threat. No, I don't know that door. I don't know that door-dash would want us to say that

514
00:42:17,680 --> 00:42:26,040
That's probably a good point hey timeout on the door-dash ad go on and say that Travis is a Joker is is Jared Leto's Joker actually

515
00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:33,360
Yeah, I got fucking door-dash last night. I got el ranchito brought me that case. I beat it. Oh god. Oh my goodness

Doctors therapists and everyday folks about the obstacles that our world and our brains throw in front of us depression

544
00:44:58,360 --> 00:45:04,920
Anxiety traumatic stress all those mental health challenges that are way more common and more treatable than you might think

545
00:45:05,160 --> 00:45:09,240
The first time I went to therapy I was so ashamed and I was like can't believe I gotta go in there

546
00:45:09,240 --> 00:45:12,440
Like I thought I could be a man and Humphrey Bogart was never in therapy

547
00:45:12,440 --> 00:45:16,760
And my dad said yeah, but he smoked a carton of cigarettes a day

548
00:45:17,060 --> 00:45:22,180
Give your mind a break. Give yourself a break and join me for depression mode with John Moe

549
00:45:22,180 --> 00:45:24,180
You

550
00:45:26,100 --> 00:45:30,420
Have another question, okay. Yeah do it for the past six months or so

551
00:45:30,420 --> 00:45:35,060
I've been playing wiggle by Jason Derulo featuring Snoop Dogg for my district manager

552
00:45:35,620 --> 00:45:39,540
Whenever he comes in the store, I of course just wanted to hit you guys with the samples

553
00:45:39,540 --> 00:45:55,060
So we all know we're talking about here. Sure seems okay. So you get the idea

554
00:45:55,820 --> 00:46:00,540
No, I need more how much you have any play to to the millisecond?

555
00:46:00,540 --> 00:46:04,620
Let's play as much of Jason Derulo on our podcast as we are legally allowed to do

556
00:46:04,620 --> 00:46:08,620
Just a little bit. That's it. That's it. That's it. That's it. We're passing. We're passing

557
00:46:09,180 --> 00:46:13,600
Okay. Oh man, I'm dugging like crazy over here. Yeah, I wish you guys could see my Dougie

558
00:46:13,900 --> 00:46:17,480
So you'd know what to do with that big fat button. Yeah wiggle

559
00:46:18,300 --> 00:46:20,300
It's pretty explicitly clear

560
00:46:20,900 --> 00:46:24,980
Explicitly clear wiggling. I in fact, mr. Derulo if you're listening

561
00:46:24,980 --> 00:46:28,700
You probably could have left a slightly longer pause for me to answer

562
00:46:29,220 --> 00:46:32,820
Because you asked me a question and then you answered your own question rude

563
00:46:32,820 --> 00:46:36,620
Yeah, cuz I I'm still reeling from the fact that you said I have a big fat butt

564
00:46:36,740 --> 00:46:38,340
And I don't even know what to do with it

565
00:46:38,340 --> 00:46:40,540
And I know you probably meant it in a complimentary way

566
00:46:40,540 --> 00:46:45,060
But I was not ready for that and that's not how I like to think about my own but this is a workplace

567
00:46:45,060 --> 00:46:50,300
Anyway, the initial intent was to get into wiggle wiggle. Just yeah, obviously. Yeah, it's right there

568
00:46:50,940 --> 00:46:56,580
Now I would settle for him just acknowledging that the song exists because it's escalated to be playing the song on repeat

569
00:46:56,580 --> 00:47:02,540
Every time he visits and he has not said a single word about it. Yeah, the biggest problem is that it's an awful song

570
00:47:02,540 --> 00:47:04,100
What what?

571
00:47:04,100 --> 00:47:06,100
Did you I don't think you were listening

572
00:47:06,860 --> 00:47:08,980
What are we talking about the same song? Oh

573
00:47:11,300 --> 00:47:13,380
I turn my Bluetooth off, but you get it

574
00:47:15,700 --> 00:47:20,660
This we are so far past fair use now, this is our most that's a difference or okay

575
00:47:20,660 --> 00:47:23,620
So I was just buying the ringtone on my phone. Sorry, go on

576
00:47:24,460 --> 00:47:29,500
Man, I think a good ringtone would start right at you know what to do with that big shop

577
00:47:29,500 --> 00:47:32,320
Yeah, let's see. Hold on. Let's see what I don't know. No, no, no, no, no

578
00:47:36,060 --> 00:47:41,860
Yeah, and then it wouldn't good I'm very tempted I'm sorely tension. Oh, I just did it

579
00:47:44,420 --> 00:47:46,960
Okay, got it I'll keep wings of love okay

580
00:47:48,180 --> 00:47:54,260
How much wiggling is to it? When should I cut my losses? How much wiggling is too much? That's from done with the Rulo in Denver

581
00:47:54,260 --> 00:47:56,260
You

582
00:47:57,580 --> 00:48:03,100
Run the risk of being sorry go on you started to do a prank right and you wanted to

583
00:48:03,380 --> 00:48:05,540
Establish it says here. I don't think this part got read

584
00:48:07,020 --> 00:48:11,540
The biggest problem is it's an awful song and I have to listen to it every time and the whole store has developed a Pavlovian

585
00:48:11,540 --> 00:48:17,260
Response to him coming in. So basically the premise of this question is I tried to do a prank, but I was the pranky doodle-dandy

586
00:48:17,260 --> 00:48:18,940
yes, and

587
00:48:18,940 --> 00:48:25,260
Now should I stop doing this thing that I don't like I would I would push back against the terminology of prank

588
00:48:25,740 --> 00:48:27,740
To say like a fun

589
00:48:28,340 --> 00:48:30,340
Interaction because it doesn't seem like there's no

590
00:48:30,740 --> 00:48:35,300
Prank here. I played a song and I thought it would be funny if I played it and you wiggled

591
00:48:35,300 --> 00:48:39,140
I mean a skit a bit. Yeah a bit a bit. Well, we'll call it a bit. It's a bit

592
00:48:39,140 --> 00:48:43,020
It's a fine. I think prank implies even a small modicum of like

593
00:48:43,020 --> 00:48:48,340
Cruelty it's well, I mean when we did prank you doodle-dandy

594
00:48:49,620 --> 00:48:50,980
and

595
00:48:50,980 --> 00:48:52,980
I told I

596
00:48:53,060 --> 00:48:57,980
Told Lynn that he could have BAFTA these nuts and that wasn't that was coming from a place of like love and fun

597
00:48:57,980 --> 00:49:01,180
And I think that you can I think that you can do a fun prank

598
00:49:01,180 --> 00:49:04,220
I feel like this is definitely in that vein. No one's getting hurt here except you

599
00:49:04,220 --> 00:49:08,680
It sounds like because you really don't like the song which is weird to me because it beats ass

600
00:49:08,680 --> 00:49:13,300
It the one thing is the song whips ass. So let's start there. The second thing is like

601
00:49:14,080 --> 00:49:15,040
the

602
00:49:15,040 --> 00:49:17,040
You your boss beat you

603
00:49:17,360 --> 00:49:24,860
You know you lost you lost. Yeah, you lose sir. Yeah, good day you lost you tried to prank him

604
00:49:24,960 --> 00:49:29,920
He made you play this song that you don't like so many times every time he enters the room and just right in the room

605
00:49:29,920 --> 00:49:35,040
You have to play this song you hate you he he reversed it on you. Yeah, you got reversed

606
00:49:35,680 --> 00:49:37,440
That's tough. Sorry

607
00:49:37,440 --> 00:49:39,440
That's tough

608
00:49:39,520 --> 00:49:43,400
This is the term cut your losses is literally for this very

609
00:49:44,040 --> 00:49:48,920
Because the thing is is like you're not going to regain like how much are you going too much?

610
00:49:48,920 --> 00:49:54,600
Well, apparently negative like because I have been in this position before and I guarantee you

611
00:49:55,340 --> 00:49:59,120
Every time your district managers come on you play this you have scrutinized

612
00:49:59,880 --> 00:50:07,200
Them hips to see if there's even a little wiggle. Yeah, so that you could claim victory and just to take your failure

613
00:50:07,200 --> 00:50:09,080
one step further

614
00:50:09,080 --> 00:50:14,120
There's no way your district manager didn't realize what was happening the first time you did it

615
00:50:14,120 --> 00:50:19,080
They realize what was happening and they did not give you the satisfaction of a response

616
00:50:19,080 --> 00:50:24,480
You have been so thoroughly bested that it's time for you to start to stop this one

617
00:50:24,680 --> 00:50:29,680
Unless you secretly do like the song and that's fine. Be proud of it. It's beats ass

618
00:50:30,560 --> 00:50:36,040
But you need to start working on some new material knowing now your your district manager's steely resolve

619
00:50:36,040 --> 00:50:42,000
To not at least be like what is this Bob? This is so good, right to just not even acknowledge it

620
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:44,000
It's actually some next-level shit

621
00:50:44,760 --> 00:50:46,760
You could write your own song

622
00:50:47,240 --> 00:50:52,880
That's like, you know what to do with that big fat, but don't wiggle stay still

623
00:50:53,320 --> 00:50:59,720
That's right like that. Don't acknowledge me. Keep going. Oh, you're cutting places

624
00:50:59,720 --> 00:51:02,880
Oh, you're here to lay off a bunch of people. Oh

625
00:51:02,880 --> 00:51:04,880
Oh

626
00:51:05,680 --> 00:51:11,640
We're facing extreme hardship. Oh, okay. Oh, it's a it's a branch closing

627
00:51:12,120 --> 00:51:14,880
okay with that big fat, but and like

628
00:51:15,640 --> 00:51:22,040
See how that goes. What if the original song did go, you know what to do with that big fat, but manage the disc

629
00:51:24,320 --> 00:51:30,220
Encourage employees record highs profit and loss statements

630
00:51:30,220 --> 00:51:32,220
Um

631
00:51:32,260 --> 00:51:37,540
Should we do another question is there I actually have a submission here. This is not okay

632
00:51:38,140 --> 00:51:40,860
Yeah, it's just like from from Meeps

633
00:51:42,060 --> 00:51:43,660
Who emailed?

634
00:51:43,660 --> 00:51:45,660
this Quora

635
00:51:45,940 --> 00:51:47,940
Discussion

636
00:51:49,980 --> 00:51:55,660
Elevate the discourse in our show a little bit more show elevating the discourse Meeps

637
00:51:56,820 --> 00:51:58,820
Got surfaced a question on Quora

638
00:51:58,820 --> 00:51:59,900
that

639
00:51:59,900 --> 00:52:05,700
Was this just that the Meeps could only see the question. Okay. The question was could you fight a horse?

640
00:52:06,980 --> 00:52:11,780
Could you fight a horse Meeps had to make a an account? Oh boy Quora and

641
00:52:12,580 --> 00:52:16,260
To see the answers and Meeps was right to do this

642
00:52:17,980 --> 00:52:24,660
Because now Meeps shared the answers with me and only a few people weighed weighed in on this

643
00:52:25,420 --> 00:52:27,420
so I just wanted to

644
00:52:27,420 --> 00:52:31,820
Just wanted to share their answers with you very quickly. Yeah, is that is that okay? Yeah

645
00:52:32,060 --> 00:52:37,820
Okay, so and and you tell me who you think this is the question that I want to pose you guys out here

646
00:52:37,820 --> 00:52:41,620
I read these and I'll try to truncate them because some of them really get into the weeds

647
00:52:42,060 --> 00:52:45,220
But I just want you to tell me who knows the most about horses. Okay, okay

648
00:52:45,820 --> 00:52:52,060
Fight a horse. This is Jaden fight a horse. Well now if you're talking about fighting a bucking wild horse while you're on its back

649
00:52:52,060 --> 00:52:54,060
Heck yeah, I've done it many times before

650
00:52:54,060 --> 00:52:58,300
Sure, I've gotten thrown trampled and broken a bow from being bucked

651
00:52:58,380 --> 00:53:02,060
But that's part of the experience of breaking a horse or being a rodeo

652
00:53:02,260 --> 00:53:06,500
Now if you're not the horses back and you're fighting them sure you could find a horse from the ground

653
00:53:06,540 --> 00:53:11,020
It's kind of wrangling a horse. All you need is rope. I've ripped a few horses from the ground

654
00:53:11,020 --> 00:53:16,940
It was very hard the rearing bucking moving made it harder. Plus it hurts if you get kicked. Yeah

655
00:53:17,140 --> 00:53:20,180
Yeah, that's sort of the main reason people aren't out there fighting horses

656
00:53:20,180 --> 00:53:26,140
And it kind of seems like the horse was whipping your ass, right? But if you had no rope you could still win

657
00:53:26,500 --> 00:53:29,980
I've tried this many times. It's an experience trying

658
00:53:30,820 --> 00:53:35,220
Don't run off and try this. So I have a wild bucking untamed horse running around a pin

659
00:53:35,220 --> 00:53:38,500
I'm standing in the middle first. I put my arms up ready charges at me

660
00:53:38,500 --> 00:53:42,100
I put them into a t-shape and act like a fence. Oh good start

661
00:53:44,980 --> 00:53:49,500
I put my arms into a t-shape and act like a fence and don't move

662
00:53:49,500 --> 00:53:52,180
They will stop unless you shit get out and move

663
00:53:52,740 --> 00:53:55,420
Awesome. How can you get it? Can you guarantee that?

664
00:53:56,380 --> 00:54:02,500
After they stop they may rear and buck but clap your hands together and make them run around the pin clap stop

665
00:54:02,620 --> 00:54:09,020
Whatever make the horse run. I didn't realize when you say break you meant like their mind because a fence just clapped at them

666
00:54:09,580 --> 00:54:12,140
Right when it's just like I gotta fucking stop. There's a fence

667
00:54:12,140 --> 00:54:14,980
Whoa

668
00:54:14,980 --> 00:54:16,900
Once man fence

669
00:54:16,900 --> 00:54:19,540
Once he's running around and tries to come back to you

670
00:54:19,580 --> 00:54:23,740
Keep him out there until he lowers his head or licks his lips in a sign of submission

671
00:54:23,740 --> 00:54:26,900
Hold on, then let him come to you. You have one. How does he like?

672
00:54:26,900 --> 00:54:28,540
He wants to join your herd. That would be different

673
00:54:28,540 --> 00:54:33,020
There's different ways to lick one's lips to show submission versus like, alright fuck let's do this

674
00:54:33,020 --> 00:54:36,220
I'm gonna kill you. Come on Bob. Let them come to you. You have one

675
00:54:36,220 --> 00:54:42,380
He wants to join your herd because you seem like unless he's so yeah, I can fight a horse. Oh

676
00:54:44,580 --> 00:54:48,920
Man that's a good question. It's a good question. Now. I have another answer here

677
00:54:51,580 --> 00:54:53,740
This from kata you can fight anything

678
00:54:53,740 --> 00:54:59,540
Well that said a horse is much stronger and much quicker than a human if a horse were really determined to kill you you would

679
00:54:59,540 --> 00:55:01,620
Be physically unable to do anything except perhaps

680
00:55:01,620 --> 00:55:06,540
Climb a tree or something. Yes, and that only if you're really quick about it now

681
00:55:06,540 --> 00:55:10,060
this is an excellent, I love a good pedantic answer because

682
00:55:10,660 --> 00:55:14,940
It doesn't say could you win in a fight against a horse, but simply could you fight a horse? Yes

683
00:55:15,340 --> 00:55:17,340
Yeah, it's also not like

684
00:55:17,620 --> 00:55:18,940
Can you kill a horse?

685
00:55:18,940 --> 00:55:24,300
Yeah, I mean like if you get in a fight with a person most of the time you're not like so I can kill them

686
00:55:24,300 --> 00:55:31,740
Right. Sorry cata cata continues. Oh, yeah, we have one really important advantage. Oh guys

687
00:55:31,740 --> 00:55:34,340
What would you guess weapons really important opposable weapons?

688
00:55:35,060 --> 00:55:39,660
Opposable thumbs, okay. No the ability of abstract thought

689
00:55:39,660 --> 00:55:43,180
Oh, of course the take for example around pin

690
00:55:43,180 --> 00:55:46,580
Uh-huh. It is a round space some 12 or 16 meters in diameter

691
00:55:46,620 --> 00:55:52,380
Once the exercises are done with a wild horse is to make him run circles around you that makes the horse see for himself that

692
00:55:52,380 --> 00:55:58,700
You are faster, however fast they run. You can still come in front of them. This has a profound effect on the horse's mind. Whoa

693
00:55:59,700 --> 00:56:04,580
Wow, okay, the horses are so wicked stoops

694
00:56:05,940 --> 00:56:10,660
Is what you're saying they don't understand things moving through physical space

695
00:56:12,340 --> 00:56:13,500
Okay

696
00:56:13,500 --> 00:56:18,140
There's one last answer. I just want to just just tack on here from Raymond

697
00:56:18,580 --> 00:56:21,020
Can a human successfully fight a fist fight a horse?

698
00:56:21,020 --> 00:56:22,300
I

699
00:56:22,300 --> 00:56:27,940
Raised horses, huh? My grandfather captured wild horses and domesticated them for sale

700
00:56:27,940 --> 00:56:32,940
Okay, one previous answer mentioned a horse will most likely run away. This is true

701
00:56:33,460 --> 00:56:38,940
That one that doesn't it will end you huh? Whoa, holy shit Wow

702
00:56:39,540 --> 00:56:45,420
They're likely to outweigh you five times or six times as mentioned in another answer

703
00:56:45,420 --> 00:56:53,140
Their teeth will leave gaping wounds in your flesh. Holy shit. Their preferred method is to charge you bowl you over rear up and tramp

704
00:56:53,140 --> 00:56:53,700
Oh, yeah

705
00:56:53,700 --> 00:56:59,220
Your only defense is to run if you're in a coral and try to box a horse

706
00:56:59,900 --> 00:57:04,300
Just Justin just real quick. Probably a corral. I read the word that was written

707
00:57:05,860 --> 00:57:12,540
Okay, if you're in a coral and you try to box a horse that wanted to end you one of two things that happened

708
00:57:12,540 --> 00:57:18,120
You would be so busted up you would wish for death or your friends and family would be attending your wake

709
00:57:18,660 --> 00:57:22,900
Horses are intelligent mountains of muscle. Oh best to respect them now

710
00:57:22,900 --> 00:57:28,580
Yeah, if you go in there boxing with the Queensbury rules, yes, you gotta go in there do some street fight, right?

711
00:57:28,580 --> 00:57:30,740
You guys track you gotta do a star

712
00:57:31,380 --> 00:57:36,580
You were throwing sand your you know, bobbing and weaving and tucking and rolling

713
00:57:36,580 --> 00:57:39,820
You know what? I mean? I'm not can I tell you guys my problem with this question?

714
00:57:39,820 --> 00:57:45,180
They're only thinking about it quite literally could you fight a horse but I would add in a couple words there

715
00:57:45,180 --> 00:57:47,180
Could you bring yourself to fight a horse?

716
00:57:47,840 --> 00:57:52,180
Right you walk up there and you're like, all right, let's do this. I I feel terrible

717
00:57:52,180 --> 00:57:56,900
You broke your leg. I gotta put you down, but I'm gonna do it because I love you so much with these two hands

718
00:57:57,340 --> 00:58:01,020
Right. I'm not gonna use some highfalutin gun

719
00:58:01,020 --> 00:58:04,940
I'm gonna do it with these two hands and you roll but then you look them in the eye

720
00:58:04,940 --> 00:58:11,780
You're like goddamn don't look at me like that. Don't look at me like that fight back fight back
