1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,820
The McElroy brothers are not experts and their advice should never be followed

2
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:10,580
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it

3
00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:17,660
Also, this show isn't for kids which I mentioned only so the babies out there will know how cool they are for listening

4
00:00:17,660 --> 00:00:30,660
What's up, you cool, baby?

5
00:00:47,660 --> 00:00:49,660
It's better it's better with you

6
00:01:08,980 --> 00:01:10,100
You

7
00:01:10,100 --> 00:01:17,020
Hello everybody and welcome to my brother my brother and me and if I show for the Roger, I'm your oldest brother Justin McElroy

8
00:01:17,020 --> 00:01:20,340
Well me, I'm your middle-aged brother Travis big dog woof woof

9
00:01:20,980 --> 00:01:26,260
McElroy and I'm your sweet baby brother Griffin McElroy and I got big news for you

10
00:01:26,260 --> 00:01:31,720
Just came in through the local channels that the pools and the splash pads are back open

11
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:34,760
And this is a citywide alert and for Austin, Texas

12
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:39,820
But I imagine also around the world people are celebrating as these big beautiful water

13
00:01:40,620 --> 00:01:45,840
Bodies are ready for business for you. It's a splash pad splash pads like a pool, but it doesn't

14
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:49,880
Go deep you splashed it very very very shallow pool

15
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:53,700
But the big pool is what I'm concerned about because I am known

16
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:56,760
at my local pools

17
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:58,680
for

18
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:02,240
When I walk up on it when I walk up on the diving board

19
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:05,720
in my Oakley's and

20
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:13,420
That one little strip of sunscreen on my nose. Oh, yeah. Yeah, and and my

21
00:02:13,420 --> 00:02:14,980
surf

22
00:02:14,980 --> 00:02:21,500
shorts, uh-huh, and I do my flex and every the glisten of my body

23
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:26,460
Catches the light in just the right way and everybody looks at me and they're like, oh no here he comes

24
00:02:26,460 --> 00:02:30,060
And then I do my you know, my big jump off of it and splash down

25
00:02:30,060 --> 00:02:36,940
I people who know me and last year just from the splash from the splash in the pose and the

26
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:41,940
Shorts and now the whole thing and the strip of sunscreen last year though

27
00:02:41,940 --> 00:02:43,220
Yeah

28
00:02:43,220 --> 00:02:45,540
It's fucking disease. Yeah

29
00:02:46,620 --> 00:02:48,620
Finally we're talking about it

30
00:02:48,620 --> 00:02:54,080
And this disease sucks shit on so many different levels, but the disease kept me from getting mine last year

31
00:02:54,180 --> 00:02:59,040
Yeah, I didn't get a chance to go to my local pool and do my favorite thing

32
00:02:59,060 --> 00:03:03,100
Which is panic as my child is eating a popsicle too slowly

33
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:07,260
And I know it's gonna fall off as a stick and I know she's gonna be upset about it

34
00:03:07,260 --> 00:03:12,020
And I'm standing there in my rash guard, but I'm not surfing. I'm just covering myself

35
00:03:12,020 --> 00:03:18,180
Cuz I'm afraid of both the Sun and other people's gaze. Yes, so I'm sitting there like, you know, you need to eat it

36
00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:20,380
No, it's it's drip. It's dripping. It is drip

37
00:03:20,380 --> 00:03:25,420
You have to it's gonna fall. Yes, and I'm worried about it. She's not because she has no sense of consequences

38
00:03:25,420 --> 00:03:30,920
Yes, right legalize marijuana strike all marijuana based crimes from the record

39
00:03:31,420 --> 00:03:33,420
expunge them but

40
00:03:33,420 --> 00:03:39,700
Popsicles you have to be 18 because not 18. You don't fucking understand

41
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:47,320
What the what is expected of you and the pressure and also the consequences though if you do go slow and you do get

42
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:53,660
I'll take it to go. I'll be eating it in the worst way imaginable. Whatever the you know

43
00:03:53,660 --> 00:03:59,120
The move I love is like I've had four licks off this. I'm gonna set it somewhere. Yeah, I don't remember

44
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:04,160
Yeah, I set it down three. What do I care? Um, but now

45
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:08,160
Yeah, I got this fucking text. That's like pool time, baby

46
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:14,400
And that the text texted you that well the text went out and said hey everybody, especially Griffin

47
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:18,360
The pools are open again. So everybody detects the pools the mayor

48
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:20,880
and so

49
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:27,440
Mayor Austin Austin mayor Austin Austin Steve Austin of Austin is telling me that it's time to come get my splash on and he said

50
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:29,360
That I could be first in line

51
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:34,680
There and it was gonna be sort of a ribbon-cutting ceremony and I'm gonna jump through the ribbon in midair. But anyway, I

52
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:38,600
The pressure is huge now

53
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:47,160
Because I had a year to think about I had two years to think about how I was gonna make a splash. Yeah

54
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:51,760
Literally, hey, hey Griffin Griffin. Yeah. Yeah

55
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:55,960
Yeah, only mask you're gonna be wearing is a snorkel

56
00:04:55,960 --> 00:05:00,840
No, you don't need that when you're doing a diving board splash. Oh, you don't

57
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:03,480
Here's they've seen me do

58
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:08,160
Cannonball, they've seen me do double cannonball. Mm-hmm

59
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:10,680
That's where me and a friend do it at the same time

60
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:14,840
And we got yelled at by the lifeguard so we can't do the double cannonball again

61
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:18,680
Cuz they said they'd kick me out of the pool. They don't care how cool I am when I do it jackknife

62
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,240
Yeah

63
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:26,760
Spread spread it spread it out. I did a I did a phone I've done all the big ones

64
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:28,800
and I guess I just like

65
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:33,080
I'm a little worried that I'm gonna come up short this year. Have you done the enema?

66
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,240
That's the one where you get your though you get it to go up

67
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:42,640
Yeah, where you land like the first part of your body that makes contact with the water is your butthole

68
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:48,800
Yeah, and it looks like even the cheeks touch. It looks like a cannonball. So you have to announce loudly like it's about to go

69
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:50,800
Oh, it's about to go up

70
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:53,280
It's gonna look like a cannonball, but it's gonna go up

71
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:54,920
and

72
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:59,360
It's about how you then come out of the water like what sounds you make what face you make? Yeah

73
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:01,960
Yeah, like ah

74
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:09,440
Enema, I don't I I don't know more like enemy I cuz people are waiting. Also, this is gonna be

75
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:17,760
Them knowing that it's all over like the code like coven we're we did we did it and now it's time for us to

76
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:23,680
Do our this is our mission accomplished banner. Yeah, exactly. I think you're gonna have to make up a new one Griffin

77
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:28,160
Yeah, you're gonna have to like sit down at the drawing board

78
00:06:28,260 --> 00:06:32,180
You're gonna have to design something and call it like, you know operation mission accomplished

79
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:34,960
And like you're gonna have to do

80
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:37,460
You know

81
00:06:37,460 --> 00:06:43,400
Operation herd immunity whatever you want to call this dive, right and it has to tell the story

82
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:46,160
of America's triumph

83
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:48,160
Okay

84
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:50,680
Travis is suggesting a narrative

85
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:56,360
Splash a narrative dive. Yes, that's a good dive that tells a story that we use a tail

86
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:59,800
Yes, that's good Travis and I'll be honest. It's give me an idea

87
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:02,320
That's better than my current sort of prevailing idea

88
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:06,120
Which is that I get on the diving board and I jump up and I just keep going up

89
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:09,820
Cuz I didn't know like how I was gonna make that one happen

90
00:07:09,820 --> 00:07:17,080
But you've give me idea of when Time magazine said that I was person of the year or whoever was reading the magazine was person

91
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:19,180
Of the year and they put a little mirror on the cover

92
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:26,440
Maybe that's it and I get up on the diving board and I hold up a big mirror and I say it's you blind

93
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:31,600
Everyone no, I say it's you doing the splash. Oh, I like that

94
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:37,780
Maybe just a mirror suit Griffin just little chunks like a mosaic, but it's like little chunks of mirror all over you

95
00:07:37,780 --> 00:07:42,120
So when they look at you, it is actually their body that they see perfectly

96
00:07:42,820 --> 00:07:47,340
Aligned with your body. That's good. Yeah, that's awesome

97
00:07:47,780 --> 00:07:52,260
What if I lay what if I plank on the side of the pool and I say I'm the diving board

98
00:07:52,260 --> 00:07:57,640
Oh, you're the jump off jump off my body into the what if you sit in the pool with your mouth open say

99
00:07:57,640 --> 00:08:03,280
This is my tiny pool. Yes, and I fill my mouth right you to leap in. That's really good Justin

100
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:11,040
a team a team of people kind of a flash mob of people and one by one is they jump off

101
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:16,140
It's it's like the declaration of independence right one word at a time

102
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:21,040
Okay, and you guys are going boom boom boom boom boom boom, you know, I mean like one after another

103
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:28,640
Just everybody lined up going and it's like we the people right or maybe it's even every syllable, right?

104
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:32,480
Yeah, we the people. Is that what you're going with? Yeah. Yes

105
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:34,280
Okay, good

106
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:35,160
That could be good

107
00:08:35,160 --> 00:08:40,760
I also thought if I could do get on that little horses back and get him a jump on the diving board that would hurt him

108
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:46,540
And he would unless it's one of those cool like beach horses, which I don't think they have those in Central, Texas

109
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:49,040
He would pass away

110
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:51,520
Get a celebrity diver. Oh

111
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:55,320
Yeah

112
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:57,840
Okay

113
00:08:57,840 --> 00:09:03,520
Sure, yeah name another one name another diver who's not Greg Louganis. Oh, I didn't mean to be fair

114
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:08,120
I did not mean a diver who was a celebrity. I meant a celebrity to dive

115
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:17,200
For you the thing about Greg Louganis is everyone's gonna be really nervous. He's gonna bonk his head again. Yeah, like he's an exceptional diver

116
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:24,320
Athlete, but he did famously bonk his head one time and I think people would be like I'm trying to celebrate kovat

117
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:25,880
But here I am all stressed out that mr

118
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:32,020
Louganis is gonna bonk his noggin again is Michael Phelps good at getting into the water or is he just good inside of it?

119
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:36,360
Yeah, the camera cuts away cuts back. He's already in the water

120
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:43,320
Exactly. He might just kind of flail all around in midair as he just kind of like lowers in and he snorts like a half

121
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:45,320
quarter water each time

122
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:53,100
It's okay Michael it's okay you're in you're in it's fine

123
00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:57,460
You can start swimming now. Okay people start showing up to the Olympic Arena

124
00:09:57,900 --> 00:10:02,940
He's already in the water. He got there first. He got there an hour before everybody else

125
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:09,020
He had them fill the pool around him. Yeah. Oh, that could be good. Where is Griffin?

126
00:10:09,020 --> 00:10:13,840
He's been at the bottom of the pool for an hour holding his breath. He did the splash a long time

127
00:10:14,860 --> 00:10:18,180
I have a quick update. I wanted to mention and

128
00:10:18,180 --> 00:10:25,060
This was shared amongst our staff and now I want to bring it to everyone's attention last week. We had a brief segment a

129
00:10:25,740 --> 00:10:27,360
diverting

130
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:29,900
segment about Charles entertainment cheese and

131
00:10:30,580 --> 00:10:35,380
I did want to mention just because I did not have the information at the time that since

132
00:10:35,980 --> 00:10:37,500
2012

133
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:43,180
Charles entertainment cheese has been voiced by Jared Reddick the lead singer of bowling for soup. Oh

134
00:10:43,180 --> 00:10:48,620
Oh, so not only see the voice of the theme song of Phineas and Ferb

135
00:10:48,980 --> 00:10:53,060
He is also the voice of Charles entertainment cheese and has been for you

136
00:10:53,060 --> 00:10:55,860
That's nine years of the authenticity that you heard in those tracks

137
00:10:55,860 --> 00:10:56,140
Yeah

138
00:10:56,140 --> 00:11:03,600
real like real the Phineas the Phineas and Ferb thing Justin just unlocked a fucking puzzle box in my mind that has been

139
00:11:03,980 --> 00:11:05,860
Screwed pretty tight

140
00:11:05,860 --> 00:11:08,940
Since the since the episode since the recording of that episode

141
00:11:08,940 --> 00:11:15,940
I'm so glad that you've just set me free from the prison of my own thoughts. Tell me more. What do you how do you mean?

142
00:11:15,940 --> 00:11:18,940
It just sounded there was something about Charles entertainment cheese the town

143
00:11:18,940 --> 00:11:19,980
It's always so familiar

144
00:11:19,980 --> 00:11:25,220
Yeah, it was and it was because of the Phineas and Ferb music and I know the thing is fucking me out

145
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:28,040
What is knowing that after the fight is?

146
00:11:28,700 --> 00:11:35,540
After the fact knowing that it's actually weird to me that it's taken them nine years to think. Oh, maybe an album

147
00:11:35,540 --> 00:11:42,060
Hey, they hey bud get on Spotify and then feel like a real doofus. This guy's been cranking out the hits for a long really

00:11:55,620 --> 00:11:58,460
But now we're gonna help you. Yeah, I want to talk about art

152
00:11:59,180 --> 00:12:05,220
Let's you know because sometimes this show can be a little puerile, but sometimes it could be pretty artsy fartsy

153
00:12:05,220 --> 00:12:08,060
And it's time for work of fart

154
00:12:09,860 --> 00:12:13,460
Just so you know, just so you know trap sorry haters. No, I am I am one of them

156
00:12:17,420 --> 00:12:23,660
Okay, I got three and then a bonus one. So okay. Okay. Okay. Here we go. It's a good way of thinking about it

157
00:12:23,660 --> 00:12:26,580
Yeah, okay this great novel

musician's obsession with finding the perfect phallus

160
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:37,560
Wait, is it wait? Hold on. Do we do ding-dong stuff too? Yeah

161
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:44,920
Whoa, that's the you're expanding sort of the whole concept. Yeah, this is a broadening. This is too broad

162
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:49,200
Yeah, it's getting silly in work of fart. Okay. Give me that again

163
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:51,800
This novel this great novel

164
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:53,640
details

165
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:59,080
The journey of one musician and his obsession with finding the perfect phallus

166
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:02,320
Hmm

167
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:04,980
Damn here. I was talking a big game

168
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:12,360
I'm gonna need more

169
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:19,540
Well focus on the the musician part is a ball. Thanks trap. Oh fuck. Yeah, I forgot about one of the ten words that you said

170
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:25,000
That's all I got. I don't have more clues. Are you ready? I'll just tell you what it is. Justin you wanna make a guess

171
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:30,440
No, we were looking for Moby's dick

172
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:32,440
Dick

173
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:37,080
Moby's dick, but it's that was a book about a whale and not a musician but it was the

174
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:43,480
Musician, this is what he's doing. No, no, I know he's pulling the threads tighter, but you would you wouldn't

175
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:48,320
Do you there's no way on a million in a million years. We would have gotten that

176
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:56,680
Oh stop stop if you had said a musical artist who is obsessed with his own

177
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,720
Phallus I might have been able to get there. Yeah

178
00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:03,480
But like I wouldn't look at yeah

179
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:09,160
I don't look at any other dick in this any other like PP in this world and go that's mine

180
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:17,520
Okay, are you ready? I guess so. Is this one gonna make sense and be like solvable and be good this series?

181
00:14:17,520 --> 00:14:20,080
created by Benjamin Franklin

182
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:28,020
Collected all of the scrotal information for that year as well as richards almasack

183
00:14:28,020 --> 00:14:31,240
Oh so close. Well, you know what? Let me look at the judges

184
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:39,400
We are looking for poor Richards Balman act, but we'll give it to you. Okay. Well, let's agree to disagree. Just say Balmasack

185
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:43,360
I'm miss when I was about

186
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:50,000
All right, fine. I can't I this is a shady. It's the our president did a graded like this that he has to be drug into

187
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:55,920
Okay, I got one more and given this one's back to poops. Are you ready? Yeah, I guess okay

188
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:57,920
I can't believe that I'm reminiscent

189
00:14:58,960 --> 00:15:05,200
About that but go ahead Heathcliff. Yeah plots revenge now that he has money

190
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:10,280
Against the woman who spurned him and also he can't stop pooping

191
00:15:10,280 --> 00:15:15,600
Heathcliff, uh-huh. Not the cat but a character named Heathcliff, correct?

192
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:24,280
This is classic literature, which is not my which is not my strong suit is

193
00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:26,920
that is that from

194
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:34,120
With her is it withering heights with her and shucks. Is it withering shites? It is withering shites

195
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:36,960
It is withering shites

196
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:40,480
It is withering shites one for one one

197
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:46,320
One for one one for three. Wow. Sorry you each have one. Okay. Okay

198
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:50,240
Okay, so the bonus now. Yeah ready its deed

199
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:55,200
It's necessary unless it's also gonna be bad like the first one. Well, that's why it's a bonus

200
00:15:56,400 --> 00:15:59,080
Okay, wait a bonus cuz it's not very good

201
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:01,120
We'll see

202
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:06,680
Okay, Stella will need to depend on the kindness of strangers if she's allergic to D's

203
00:16:06,680 --> 00:16:33,840
Is it a streetcar named these nuts doing it and it's already going off the rails

204
00:16:36,680 --> 00:16:45,840
That can't be this can't be the episode title

205
00:16:53,160 --> 00:16:56,720
All right, well then it's up to us to something more

206
00:16:57,560 --> 00:16:58,880
more

207
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:01,440
Powerful Griffin you didn't hear it. I think

208
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:08,480
I said it first Justin. I heard it. I thought it I knew it

209
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:27,360
Okay, so are you done yep

210
00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:32,560
Once again Griffin wins by the way two to one. Yeah, we all lost

211
00:17:33,040 --> 00:17:37,920
I work at a bakery that often has items left over at the end of the day

212
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:40,440
No

213
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:42,800
Together

214
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:56,760
At the end of the day my boss lets me take out whatever I want when we close up shop

215
00:17:57,360 --> 00:18:00,160
We also give whatever is left away to a local church

216
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:06,880
My problem is that the church volunteers all stand there watching me pack up whatever I want, which is admittedly quite a bit

217
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:14,080
Brothers, what do I do about the very passive judgment? I feel that's from sweets taker in South, Texas

218
00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:19,880
Yeah, they shouldn't be there while you're doing your shouldn't watch you

219
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:26,160
They shouldn't watch you while you do yours and this may be something you can fix by maybe throughout the day

220
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:28,880
If you know something's gonna get

221
00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:30,720
you know

222
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:34,000
back when I was working at GameStop if somebody traded in like ooh, this is a

223
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:38,760
A fairly mint copy of dark cloud 2 on PlayStation 2. I'm gonna want this

224
00:18:39,320 --> 00:18:44,080
So I might not stock this one on the shelves right away and buy it myself

225
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:47,360
I've done a lot of things at GameStop that should have got me quite fire

226
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:52,440
But I'm saying you do the same thing this cheese Danish looks pretty good. Let me just oops

227
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:54,440
I dropped it under the bottom rack

228
00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:58,480
Where no one can see it and then the church doesn't have to watch you get it

229
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:02,920
They should you do though Griffin in that plan to run the risk of like your boss being like hey

230
00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:07,080
What's this stack of kolaches doing back here in this cupboard like those are for God?

231
00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:16,320
Your Ross has created a scenario where like you are de-incentivized to move these on our hearts, right?

232
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:21,240
So someone's like I'll take an almond tart and you're like, I don't know

233
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:28,000
I've heard about those heard something about those I would leave that behind for me. I mean

234
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:33,760
I mean also you can just get these church people in there all day anytime somebody comes in

235
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:38,960
It's like hmm. Let me buy some almond tarts for me and my beautiful wife and then you say, okay

236
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:41,160
But then the church people are like, oh no

237
00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:44,120
That's too long and tarts

238
00:19:44,360 --> 00:19:52,560
See predator predator does this and I've always felt like if I buy something at predator, I'm stealing food

239
00:19:52,560 --> 00:19:58,720
Right. When are you buying things that pretty much a yeah, I used to trap though. I didn't used to be

240
00:19:59,320 --> 00:20:01,320
bound like some sort of like

241
00:20:01,960 --> 00:20:08,080
Salt-trapped ghosts in Huntington, West Virginia, like I used to travel around throughout this great globe of ours

242
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:21,120
Yeah, what you're right though, that was a before I'll never see the inside of a fucking Kedoba I

243
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:24,440
Got a Kedoba here. I don't want to brag

244
00:20:27,080 --> 00:20:31,280
What's stopping you who who's going to Kedoba good question

245
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:35,800
Bye, you know whose decision is it when it's time to make more batches of things?

246
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:41,920
Because you would just like 20 minutes before closing up just like all right pop five in it's a bakery

247
00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:46,880
It's a fancy bakery. You're not like nuking them. Like it has to be prepared lovingly by hand. Yeah

248
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:54,160
Could you do it? Like I made these and I'm gonna why are you asking me? I don't know. It's not in charge

249
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:57,160
He's not the boss of bakery. He's not the big Baker boy

250
00:20:58,200 --> 00:21:03,520
Well, I am the big Baker boy. That's what everyone calls me in town, but not for this particular

251
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:05,520
South Texas

252
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:07,880
just like just

253
00:21:08,560 --> 00:21:15,800
You know what make the church people go first and then if they leave you interesting if they leave you nothing just go

254
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:22,720
Oh, uh, okay. I um, okay. I guess I'll won't eat any baked sweets tonight

255
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:30,800
You can also say you're taking them to a rival Church, there you go

256
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:36,840
Oh, this is this is for a church with even more kids in it who need these and also

257
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:43,580
They're building the church out of kolaches. And if I don't get on the kolaches, they won't have a roof

258
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:51,240
It's a kolache based kid Lutheran Church. See ya. I gotta take all of them. Do you remember those? Oh, man

259
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:57,960
I was thinking maybe some sort of auction where the church and you would each have a certain number of points

260
00:21:57,960 --> 00:22:01,640
Oh, that's good arbitrary points. You could bid on different baked goods

261
00:22:01,640 --> 00:22:05,920
So that would probably extend this a lot longer than you want you want it to go

262
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:10,680
I was actually just remembering do you remember the auctions that used to have a church? Yeah, it was the weirdest shit

263
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:12,680
I've told we've talked about

264
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:15,340
We have to because it's I don't think so

265
00:22:15,340 --> 00:22:19,880
I barely remember it's like on the edge of my memory like if I hadn't remembered this today

266
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:21,400
I would have permanently forgotten it

267
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:27,880
Like basically if we haven't talked about it before you were given points awarded points for things like memorizing a Bible verse

268
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:32,400
So remembering to bring your Bible bringing a friend was a big one was a billion

269
00:22:33,560 --> 00:22:39,960
Juicy one right there. And then at the end of the year, they would have a stage full of prizes

270
00:22:40,840 --> 00:22:46,120
Like it doesn't really get amazing. Yeah, that's why I got my big mouth Billy Bass from

271
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:51,880
It is a dragon's horde. Yes. I got a baseball mitt. I got a

272
00:22:52,680 --> 00:22:57,160
Tool belt one time but then you and you would see the kids they come in that night

273
00:22:57,160 --> 00:23:01,960
They're standing around like, you know, like I realize I'm like, I'm definitely gonna bid on that. Oh, is that a basketball?

274
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:07,080
Oh, yeah, I'm gonna give them and then an auctioneer would auction them off

275
00:23:08,040 --> 00:23:10,040
and it's so

276
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:13,300
Strange and it was a good incentive program

277
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:16,200
To save souls to save them

278
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:25,640
That's has nothing to do with this particular question, but it's fun it's fun to talk about some some stuff

279
00:23:25,640 --> 00:23:27,640
I

280
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:29,480
Don't think they should be there

281
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:34,000
I think this is up to you to not let them be in there while you take your stuff

282
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:37,320
I need privacy for my selection process

283
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:43,580
Yeah, I don't put it all in your cheeks like a beautiful chip. Oh, yeah happens. So while you make eye contact with them

284
00:23:44,040 --> 00:23:46,040
No again

285
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:50,680
Do y'all want some some wisdom of the crowd? Yes online

286
00:23:50,680 --> 00:23:59,920
This is another is another wiki how joint that Amelia sent in that Travis saw and then made sure that I saw it and it's

287
00:23:59,920 --> 00:24:02,880
It's a choice one because this article is gonna save a lot of lives

288
00:24:03,080 --> 00:24:09,660
This this segment when it does feature wiki how I think it's gonna have the added benefit of being first of all real gut buster

289
00:24:10,120 --> 00:24:15,080
But second of all save your life save someone's life because this one is how to act when near a coyote

290
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:18,880
That's the title of it. It was last updated April 26 2020

291
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:20,880
which is great because if there's been

292
00:24:21,300 --> 00:24:29,020
Coyote evolutions coyote developments as long as they didn't happen within the last year like we're with this article is gonna have us covered

293
00:24:29,820 --> 00:24:32,420
And I will just say that in all of the drawings here

294
00:24:32,420 --> 00:24:38,740
The coyotes look very cute and very squat and small and that's not like the coyotes

295
00:24:38,740 --> 00:24:40,740
I've seen and that's all I'm gonna say about that

296
00:24:41,100 --> 00:24:44,540
But let's start let's just get into it and then we'll talk about some of the audience Q&A

297
00:24:44,540 --> 00:24:51,100
Method number one defend yourself at close range by looking at them in the eyes and back away because the coyote is afraid of you

298
00:24:51,500 --> 00:24:58,240
Make yourself big is another thing. No, wait, hold on that first one. I said that the coyotes afraid of me

299
00:24:58,800 --> 00:25:04,940
Yeah, coyotes are generally frightened of people and will not confront you. I don't know that I trust that that might be true

300
00:25:05,260 --> 00:25:09,860
But with my luck I get that coyote is like I've seen some shit. I'm not afraid of you. Yeah

301
00:25:09,860 --> 00:25:14,440
There's there's yeah coyotes are nasty customers. They will good. They will come at you and that's why in this one

302
00:25:14,440 --> 00:25:20,840
Hold your backpack above your head or your jacket to make yourself seem big or you can shout or yell to frighten the coyote

303
00:25:20,840 --> 00:25:23,920
Or you can throw sticks or rocks to scare away the coyote

304
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:27,480
So those are things that don't throw anything at the coyote but near it I guess

305
00:25:28,760 --> 00:25:34,100
Actually, damn, I'm looking at this picture the trajectory of this stick might be coyote bound don't throw sticks at coyotes

306
00:25:34,100 --> 00:25:37,360
I'm gonna say that just to point my flag stick for the coyote to chase

307
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:42,160
Like I'm kind of puppy dog now this is important and God

308
00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:46,720
I hope nobody got a phone call in the middle of this episode and stopped before these words

309
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:51,240
I'm saying right now and then was confronted by a pack of coyotes because guess what?

310
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:55,440
When you're dealing with an entire pack of coyotes, the instructions are

311
00:25:56,000 --> 00:26:00,120
Basically the opposite you do not even give them ample space

312
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:06,360
Do not stare at any of them or act threatening toward them one right one fucking mad dog

313
00:26:06,360 --> 00:26:10,200
Um, that's why they call it that you mad dog one coyote three coyotes

314
00:26:10,920 --> 00:26:17,640
Look unimpressed. Let's look up at the sky. Do not shake a stick. Do not yell. Just be okay. I being somewhere else

315
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:22,600
I like that. They give the instruction give them ample space like no fuck

316
00:26:24,120 --> 00:26:27,440
Like I did not think the best way was like I'm gonna crowd

317
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:32,160
I'm gonna crowd into him like I'm trying to get first in line for the buffet. You know what I mean?

318
00:26:32,160 --> 00:26:36,720
Like I know yeah method number three is staying safe in coyote territory

319
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:40,440
It has only one step and it says be vigilant with your children and pets

320
00:26:40,440 --> 00:26:44,120
Make sure they don't get too close since they can be drawn toward animals and there's a picture of a dad

321
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:50,560
Ushering his small blonde child away from the three coyotes that are approaching him. No, no

322
00:26:50,560 --> 00:26:58,000
Yeah, these coyotes aren't for you. These sick-looking dogs aren't fun. Like yeah dog. I know I see them, too

323
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:04,360
So that's helpful. Remember one coyote scare that coyote three coyotes be scared of those coyotes and don't

324
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:11,440
That's why you need coyotes only one then, you know, it's time for fun, right?

325
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:16,720
If the coyotes are all three you lay down and you soil yourself and you hope

326
00:27:18,440 --> 00:27:20,440
With shit or pee

327
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:22,320
That's the right

328
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:28,000
Now I did say that's all you need to know the community did swing in here with a lot good Q&A's and a lot of them are

329
00:27:28,160 --> 00:27:29,520
fear-based

330
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:33,740
That there are coyotes in our yard and they killed all the neighbors chickens. Should I be scared? I

331
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:39,800
Don't somebody answers that says don't be scared but be wary don't go outside once it's dark and keep food inside so that you won't

332
00:27:39,800 --> 00:27:44,200
Attract unwanted animals. That sounds like scared behavior to me. That sounds like scared behavior

333
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:49,120
That sounds like the behavior of a scared person. What can I do if I hear young coyotes howling near my home?

334
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:53,280
Just stay inside, especially if it's nighttime. Make sure your pets are safe as well a

335
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:58,040
Ship in harbor is safe though. And that's very young

336
00:27:58,840 --> 00:28:03,120
You could get in there and reform them before it's too late. That sounds trainable right there

337
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:08,360
Yes, they're older like I've seen Fox and the Hound right that's fine. Pretty chill early on

338
00:28:09,040 --> 00:28:11,600
Right now right when that Fox is bigger. I don't want

339
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:17,560
He goes I mean turns into Robin Hood, but I don't want to get in there sexy

340
00:28:17,560 --> 00:28:21,320
I he's so sexy so sexual when the coyotes are young

341
00:28:21,320 --> 00:28:25,200
I feel like I could get in there and befriend them like oh, here's some meat. Let's hang out

342
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:27,240
Hey, how's how's your walk with Christ?

343
00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:31,960
You know, I'm in there and I'm talking to them and tell them the good things they could do with their lives and turn it around

344
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:39,400
I'm standing and delivering them. I'm gonna teach them about math and stuff, but now you guys know about coyotes

345
00:28:39,400 --> 00:28:41,680
So I'm not gonna provide the answers to the next questions

346
00:28:41,680 --> 00:28:44,600
I want to see if you guys can really knock it out of the park. So juice

347
00:28:44,600 --> 00:28:48,280
What do I do if a coyotes outside my front door and I need to go out?

348
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:50,380
Get a bat

349
00:28:50,380 --> 00:28:56,280
Yeah, that's actually not it says I recommend waiting until the coyote leaves the area if it's an emergency and you must leave your house

350
00:28:56,280 --> 00:29:00,560
Do so with caution and consider bringing a weapon or something to protect yourself. Okay, so not that far off

351
00:29:00,560 --> 00:29:03,900
I'm not that wicked far off. Although again, this is a community answer not from a

352
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:06,720
respected coyotologist, so

353
00:29:08,040 --> 00:29:12,800
Am I in danger if I hear coyotes near my house in the mornings Travis in the mornings

354
00:29:12,800 --> 00:29:19,360
No, absolutely not. They're sluggish and sleepy. They have not been warmed by the Sun yet. Yes, that's exactly it

355
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:23,320
They get their power from the Sun just like a Superman does. Yeah, I knew it Justin

356
00:29:23,320 --> 00:29:28,040
I got to get to work and I have to ride my bicycle through an area with high coyote activity

357
00:29:28,040 --> 00:29:34,240
What should I do tie bats to your bicycle like it just married cans? Yeah, that's what it says just here Justin

358
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:39,060
Great job. What if a pack surrounds your campsite and howls traps? You're gonna howl right back

359
00:29:39,060 --> 00:29:45,500
You remember that pack now my friend welcome your coyote. That's right Travis. It says turn into a coyote with magic from

360
00:29:46,280 --> 00:29:50,320
Some sort of spirit or an amorous that says it right there

361
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:53,880
Justin this one's great. What should I do if I am scared? Oh

362
00:29:55,560 --> 00:30:00,360
Boy if I had the answer to that one, I'd probably be a little bit of much more chill daily existence. Yeah

363
00:30:01,480 --> 00:30:07,120
Gosh, I don't know. I guess some there's some schools of thought that say like acceptance therapy

364
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:10,560
It's the way to go you accept these fears. Yes. I have these here. Okay. Sorry, let's Frank

365
00:30:10,560 --> 00:30:18,000
Let's bring this specifically around coyotes if you can. Oh, oh, oh, okay. Sorry. That is your human body giving you smart news

366
00:30:20,560 --> 00:30:26,760
You're bad at coyote and you shouldn't vacate. Yeah, that is your listen to the good news from your human body

367
00:30:26,760 --> 00:30:30,320
Yeah, but juice. Yeah, you're wrong. You have to get to work

368
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:33,600
I would argue that there are some places

369
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:38,240
Coyote should be in some places. They shouldn't if I'm out in the forest that I see a coyote

370
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:39,520
That's his home

371
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:43,600
But if I'm at my office job working on that big report for mr

372
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:49,860
Jenkins and I turn around and there's a coyote in my cubicle that coyote should be scared. This is my business

373
00:30:49,860 --> 00:30:54,240
I don't know why this has never bothered me the entirety of recording this program

374
00:30:54,240 --> 00:31:01,240
but as we're doing this segment, I am repeatedly confronted with a vision of someone who

375
00:31:01,240 --> 00:31:05,680
Finds themselves in a coyote situation

376
00:31:05,680 --> 00:31:09,720
Yeah, and is only equipped only knows about this

377
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:15,760
Information that we have like that is the one tool they've brought with them

378
00:31:15,760 --> 00:31:21,240
There is their personal item is this bit. That's what they brought to Coyote Island in my mind

379
00:31:21,240 --> 00:31:24,840
There's actually a worse scenario where they have listened to this bit

380
00:31:24,840 --> 00:31:28,520
But they also at some point did learn how to actually deal with it

381
00:31:28,520 --> 00:31:32,240
But now they can't remember which one switch exactly

382
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:35,420
So just to cover them and cover us legally

383
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:41,440
The answer to what should I do if I am scared as provided by community is you should call your parents or the nearest person

384
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:47,680
Around or call dial 9-1-1. Whatever you do. Do not run if you run the coyotes will think you're a threat and they will chase you

385
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:55,120
Getting a lot of conflicting information here, but I do appreciate the first thing I do without the cell hit up dad

386
00:31:55,120 --> 00:32:00,200
It's me. I'm on the Moby. You got me find me find me do find my phone dad. Get here

387
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:02,200
Ah, the coyote took the phone

388
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:08,360
It's me Griffin, it's everything's fine here. Did you watch dr. Who?

389
00:32:10,800 --> 00:32:14,240
I just want to cover this last one too cuz I doubt it's gonna be useful but

390
00:32:15,160 --> 00:32:18,360
Will you get attacked by a coyote if you are on a trampoline? Oh

391
00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:21,640
And the answer is if the coyote is on a trampoline

392
00:32:21,640 --> 00:32:26,160
Oh, and the community answer is if the coyotes interested in you

393
00:32:26,160 --> 00:32:28,680
It doesn't matter where you are is safer if you stay inside

394
00:32:28,840 --> 00:32:34,200
But my answer is if you're on a trampoline you will only be attacked by a coyote

395
00:32:34,920 --> 00:32:39,760
Roughly half the time because the other half you're up in the sky coyotes can't jump

396
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:45,880
And that coyote is gonna have to get on that trampoline with you. I would say you are wicked safe on it

397
00:32:45,880 --> 00:32:51,720
This is one no legal worries legal worries aside Griffin McElroy guarantee

398
00:32:52,160 --> 00:32:56,080
Coyotes coming at you get up on a trampoline. They're gonna have no fucking idea what to do

399
00:32:56,080 --> 00:33:00,920
If they do get up there popcorn bouncing baby, they're gonna know what the fuck to do with that

400
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:03,440
Hey, do you mind if we take a quick?

401
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:18,640
So sojourn is that the word to the money's I don't mind at all. Thank you. Absolutely. Thanks

402
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:20,360
You got a dream

403
00:33:20,360 --> 00:33:25,160
Right. Yeah, I'm turning into reality. Yeah. Well bad news is I have no idea how to do that. Oh

404
00:33:26,120 --> 00:33:28,120
Yes, just kidding

405
00:33:28,120 --> 00:33:35,640
I had cuz I know about Squarespace and you should too. This is the service that makeup artists are using to make websites and venues and

Can I make my stream where I realize I never finished high school and I have to go back and but it's the day of like

413
00:34:12,260 --> 00:34:13,900
The finals and I haven't studied at all

414
00:34:13,900 --> 00:34:21,260

415
00:34:21,260 --> 00:34:27,060
I when I do I like figure it out like I just jump and don't land and I think and I think like oh

416
00:34:27,060 --> 00:34:32,060
I finally figured out how to do it in real life because I think that the dream is real. Can I make that dream real?

Juicy bergamot that's in the opening is splash over you

475
00:39:23,820 --> 00:39:31,580
All of a sudden ladies are coming out of closets and woodwork crawling through windows like a zombie moves terrifying

476
00:39:37,700 --> 00:39:41,880
This bergamot, but then he's gonna we're gonna have a dry down into something

477
00:39:41,900 --> 00:39:48,620
We're gonna start to get a little bit of that amp rocks in up in there. You're gonna get some notes of citrus and tobacco

478
00:39:49,540 --> 00:39:51,420
cherry

479
00:39:51,420 --> 00:39:52,580

481
00:39:58,540 --> 00:40:03,980
Is that an option you get cherry free? It's just how it interacts with different people to the whim

482
00:40:04,500 --> 00:40:08,580
All right, the one you got you so you listen to me. Hey Richard

483
00:40:08,580 --> 00:40:11,100
Can we go back to when you said that I would wear and get attacked?

484
00:40:11,420 --> 00:40:17,460
you're gonna be it's gonna be amazing for you and the the compliments are gonna be

489
00:40:38,060 --> 00:40:39,340
I'm

490
00:40:39,340 --> 00:40:43,420
Okay, so I guess the question I would have to ask is like how warm is it outside?

491
00:40:43,540 --> 00:40:45,980
Do I have something to do outside of my house today?

492
00:40:45,980 --> 00:40:52,180
Because if not, it's probably gonna be the curvy white soap the brain of which I don't even know

493
00:40:52,180 --> 00:40:58,480
I've been using it so long. I buy a Costco in a billion packs stock. So probably probably so yeah still and then

494
00:40:59,140 --> 00:41:04,740
But if I'm going outside, it's it I mean it is gonna be pure sport and I would love to hear you think of something

495
00:41:05,380 --> 00:41:07,300
more iconic

496
00:41:07,300 --> 00:41:14,920

00:41:37,360 --> 00:41:44,400
He does not have the money for Melissa Imperial by Creed. Do you say by creed by the band creed?

551
00:45:58,740 --> 00:46:04,860
I guess compared to some of the other sense that you've talked about compared to something by create the Melissa member. Yeah. Oh

He says smells like this one. It smells like a cheese like a cheese

556
00:46:20,900 --> 00:46:26,380
All right, geez, I was like geez. Okay. I think it's time for Richard to go

557
00:46:29,380 --> 00:46:33,900
Richard go go go go go Richard go go. All right, you promise me. No, no, you don't get an outro Richard

558
00:46:33,900 --> 00:46:37,220
You need to go right now Richard. You need to go right now Richard. I

559
00:46:37,740 --> 00:46:42,300
Didn't think it would go like that. And I I'm sorry that I stepped out for so I do

560
00:46:43,340 --> 00:46:49,420
And how did you meet this guy and think like at the mall this guy kicks ass and he's funny and I gotta get them

561
00:46:49,420 --> 00:46:54,220
At the mall at the mall he I noticed he wasn't wearing a mask

562
00:46:54,220 --> 00:46:55,980
Everybody else was and I was like that's weird

563
00:46:55,980 --> 00:46:59,580
And he's like I don't I took it off so I could smell some different things

564
00:46:59,580 --> 00:47:03,300
And then I had a bottle of polo club sport in my hand

565
00:47:03,300 --> 00:47:09,940
He smacked it out of my hand and his hands like really big like they're the hands are like really big felt bad

566
00:47:09,940 --> 00:47:14,420
So I think I was just feeling kind of intimidated and I let him be on our podcast and I am sorry about that

567
00:47:14,420 --> 00:47:17,620
I'm sorry about Richard's sink and I'm sorry. I let him be on this

568
00:47:17,620 --> 00:47:20,300
I think the biggest thing for me is that usually when we do have a

569
00:47:20,980 --> 00:47:22,980
Richard stink come on the show

570
00:47:23,180 --> 00:47:29,040
We imprison him in the introduction to the show and I feel like having Richard stink come in, you know

571
00:47:29,660 --> 00:47:31,660
30-some odd minutes in

572
00:47:31,740 --> 00:47:34,420
Really caught a lot of us by surprise in a sense

573
00:47:34,420 --> 00:47:37,700
You could blame the fast-food industry for not coming up with new stuff, huh?

574
00:47:37,700 --> 00:47:42,340
Okay, so the people who are detractors of munch squad need now they know

575
00:47:42,340 --> 00:47:48,180
What is behind the curtain? What is behind what what lies behind this veil of ignorance?

576
00:47:48,180 --> 00:47:52,320
And that is if much squad goes away Richard stink come to play, you know

577
00:47:52,820 --> 00:47:58,900
People like I think this is gonna be a divisive moment. Okay in the in the show's history

578
00:47:58,900 --> 00:48:01,380
Yeah, because I like guests. Yeah

579
00:48:02,180 --> 00:48:07,380
Fresh energy. Yeah to the show and a lot of people don't like can I say you my one regret? I

580
00:48:07,380 --> 00:48:14,980
I didn't ask Richard if stink was his real name and it led him to the smell game

581
00:48:15,420 --> 00:48:16,740
or

582
00:48:16,740 --> 00:48:21,380
was he so into smells that he changed his last thing to stink and

583
00:48:21,940 --> 00:48:26,380
I was knowing his parents were stink up a wits. Oh in 10

584
00:48:26,540 --> 00:48:30,980
How do you know so much about Richard stink Justin? It was a long drive back from the mall

585
00:48:30,980 --> 00:48:33,280
Did you start to take him back there to get his car?

586
00:48:33,280 --> 00:48:39,000
He's giving me a thumbs up like he's fine here, which I'm not crazy about. Oh, boy. Hey

587
00:48:40,880 --> 00:48:47,440
All right, yeah, we're good he's gotten the hint he's leaving but you drove there Justin I did I think he's gonna hitchhike

588
00:48:47,680 --> 00:48:50,960
No, he stole my wife's car. God dang it. Oh shoot

589
00:48:52,240 --> 00:48:55,400
Happens to the best of us. Yes. We hear another question. Yeah

590
00:48:56,760 --> 00:48:58,000
What's wrong?

591
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:00,000
Still thinking about Richard stink, I guess

592
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:05,620
Well, this is the problem, right? You think at first it's not very good. And then it I guess he kind of gets

593
00:49:05,620 --> 00:49:10,580
I just have a hole in my heart for this is this delightful little little French smell monster

594

He's not French. What? Okay

596
00:49:17,380 --> 00:49:21,420
He he seemed to be an amalgamation of several accents

597
00:49:21,980 --> 00:49:25,820
Yeah, yeah, just can I say something actually now that he's out of it? Yeah

598
00:49:25,820 --> 00:49:32,740
Yeah, please don't bring up his walk with Christ cuz it's like get angry at you. Did you try to it's no

599
00:49:32,740 --> 00:49:34,740

600
00:49:34,740 --> 00:49:41,140
So like please if Richard sick ever comes back on the show, please don't bring up his walk with Christ. Okay. Thank you. Sure

601
00:49:41,940 --> 00:49:44,740
My mom and I recently attended the wedding of an acquaintance

602
00:49:45,320 --> 00:49:49,340
The wedding was for the son of a family friend. So we're not particularly close to them

603
00:49:49,580 --> 00:49:53,560
We chose to go the easy route on the gift and give them a card with some cash in it

604
00:49:53,560 --> 00:49:58,600
Perfect, but now my mom can't seem to remember if she put the money in the card

605
00:49:58,600 --> 00:50:03,600
Oh shit shit shit. Did we actually just give them a card as a wedding present?

606
00:50:03,600 --> 00:50:09,960
I don't want them to think we're cheapskates. They will our our family already has a bad rep for being late to everything

607
00:50:10,440 --> 00:50:15,720
Yes, we were late to the wedding. I don't want another stigma be spurting our good name

608
00:50:16,080 --> 00:50:21,320
Should we ask them if we put money in the card or should we just send them another card with money just in case?

609
00:50:21,320 --> 00:50:27,400
That's from awful wedding guests in Austin man. That second one. I think would be a big swing and a miss, huh?

610
00:50:27,400 --> 00:50:31,560
It would be it's the worst imaginable answer is to send them another car with money in it

611
00:50:31,560 --> 00:50:34,800
Cuz with a little inscription that's like here's some more I guess

612
00:50:35,320 --> 00:50:39,100
Because more or or any the first of it

613
00:50:40,080 --> 00:50:44,440
Yeah, this this one seems pretty it's embarrassing, but she got to just say like hey

614
00:50:44,440 --> 00:50:48,200
This is embarrassing, but my mom doesn't remember she put money in the card and I was there money in that card

615
00:50:48,200 --> 00:50:51,840
Oh, and then but they might fib to get double money

616
00:50:51,840 --> 00:50:54,400
But then the guilt is on them and not on you

617
00:50:54,400 --> 00:50:58,600
But and they oh, but what if they know what if they're like, I think they're testing me

618
00:50:58,600 --> 00:51:01,760
And if I say no and they know that they did oh

619
00:51:02,280 --> 00:51:05,240
It's gonna be uncomfortable no matter yeah, but the most

620
00:51:06,240 --> 00:51:08,920
Most uncomfortable is you do double card double money. That sucks

621
00:51:09,040 --> 00:51:14,320
next right behind that is you did not give them any money and you just gave them a great card that says like

622
00:51:14,320 --> 00:51:18,600
I enjoy the can't enjoy that. Yeah, I hope you don't spend it all in one place

623
00:51:19,480 --> 00:51:24,880
Can you create a third person? That's neither you nor your mother that you can blame it on

624
00:51:25,640 --> 00:51:28,160
Can you create a some kind of bumbling?

625
00:51:29,040 --> 00:51:33,840
You know a bun berry if you will where you can say like, oh, yeah. No, um our

626
00:51:34,480 --> 00:51:38,460
our butler was supposed to put the money in the card and now

627
00:51:38,460 --> 00:51:44,460
Uh, he can't remember if he did or not. And if he didn't I'm gonna fire him, right?

628
00:51:44,900 --> 00:51:47,700
A real uncle Billy is what you're talking. Yes

629
00:51:48,740 --> 00:51:53,580
It was supposed to go in but now mr. Potter is gonna take over the whole fucking fucking money, Billy

630
00:51:57,940 --> 00:52:03,880
Yeah, you guys just say it this is a tough one but it's it is I don't you can deal with this

631
00:52:04,620 --> 00:52:07,700
That you can deal with. Oh, all right

632
00:52:07,700 --> 00:52:13,040
Not is it not for jokes? Can we really play out that phone call? Sure. Can you be the okay, go ahead

633
00:52:14,460 --> 00:52:18,020
Hey, hey, what's up? This is chair and I wanted to say sorry

634
00:52:18,020 --> 00:52:22,340
What's Jen and I wanted to say that mine, you know how we were at the wedding great job great wedding

637
00:52:29,540 --> 00:52:34,980

Well, think about did you get we got a lot we had literally does

642
00:52:56,260 --> 00:52:58,260
The third person on this

Has to get always has to if one of us is quiet for too long

644
00:53:02,660 --> 00:53:04,660
