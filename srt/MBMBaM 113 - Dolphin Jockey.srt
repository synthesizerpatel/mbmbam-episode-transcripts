1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:30,800
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:51,280
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to my brother, my brother, and me, your headquarters for the free

6
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Fred Willard effort. Is effort what we're going with? That seems kind of inert.

7
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,160
I mean, I feel like we could have had alliteration there, but

8
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:17,680
free Fred Willard fun, won't you? Willard wiener, why? What? What? We lax.

9
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:27,520
McElroy is my middle brother. My youngest brother is Griffin McElroy. This is their voices.

10
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:32,560
This is what they sound like. Thank you for this. The lower one is Travis. He,

11
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:40,080
a few issues. Can I enumerate my issues? Why don't you recap? Give us the quick version.

12
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:44,960
Fred Willard went to an adult movie theater and masturbated, and then he got fired from

13
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:52,640
public television and radio. Right. So, enumerated list of issues. One,

14
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:59,600
fucking layoff. Two, just chill out. Two, Frederick. Listen, a lot of people have been drawing,

15
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:04,000
and by a lot of people, I haven't been following this closely. I have been, mistakenly, but then I

16
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,760
remedied my thought process. A lot of people have been drawing comparisons between this and the Paul

17
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:15,840
Rubin's Jerkoff accident incident of 1996. When was it? It was early. It was 21 years ago. For

18
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:22,960
fuck's sake. You deal with the fact that someone was born on the day that Pee Wee Herman was

19
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:28,640
arrested and can share a cocktail with someone over the fact that Fred Willard was arrested for

20
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:36,480
the exact same crime. Back then, it was rough and tumble because he was a kid star, and he was

21
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:47,360
baiting much like a kid star wouldn't do. But this was also in 1973. This is, hey Fred, it's 2012,

22
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:53,200
sir. Frederick, you can do this at home. You can do this in front of your computer. Well, see,

23
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:58,320
that brings me to my first issue with the whole thing, which is a pretty broad issue. Why the

24
00:02:58,320 --> 00:03:03,120
fuck are there still adult theaters? Yeah, it's a pretty broad issue. Why doesn't he just get

25
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:09,280
himself a pretty broad? You're a famous man. You've got some money in the bank. Once you go

26
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:14,960
out to the local dancing halls and meet a lady your own age, where are these theaters even

27
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:22,480
operating? Can I tell you the bigger double question? This is in Los Angeles, right?

28
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:29,440
I don't have no other crime to be worrying about other than my boyfriend Willard trying to hang.

29
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:35,760
Other than my boyfriend Willard trying to hang? Go bust some real criminals.

30
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:39,680
I'm willing to bet that wherever in any town there is an adult theater,

31
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:44,000
that adult theater constitutes the seedy underbelly of that town.

32
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:49,040
Now, are we casting dispersions because he was at this adult theater or because he was

33
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:53,920
jerking it so right at this adult theater? I've heard people say in his defense that

34
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:59,600
he was not jerking it right. He was just there and the police did a walkthrough and saw a famous

35
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:05,840
person and arrested him. No matter what, fuck it. Because A, if he wants to be at an adult theater,

36
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:12,560
that's his prerogative. He comes from a classic, the bronze age of America,

37
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:16,560
when everybody was jerking off all the time, everywhere, on everything.

38
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:19,760
It was the greatest jerk-oration. It was our greatest generation.

39
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:24,960
But at the same time, even if he was jerking it, what else are you going to do in there?

40
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:29,520
You can't fucking play, you can't fucking get out the old iPhone and play cut the rope.

41
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:33,440
You can yell that because someone's like, turn off your iPhone. You're disturbing everybody else

42
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:39,120
who's trying to beat it. Why are the police devoting resources to make this a safe space

43
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:45,360
for people to watch pornography and do nothing? How dare you? I'm watching genitals be exposed

44
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:50,000
I'm watching genitals be exposed on the screen, sir, not in my face.

45
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:55,440
That's way creepier to me that someone will just sit and appreciate the jugs.

46
00:04:56,560 --> 00:05:00,000
I love watching this girl get rammed and I'm going to do nothing about it.

47
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:06,720
It's a bodily function. It would be tantamount to someone going into the urinal, putting his

48
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:11,760
hands up on the wall, and just standing there. Just standing there and staring at it and not

49
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:17,120
doing anything. I'd call the cops on that guy. I think people should be arrested for not

50
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:22,640
masturbating in an adult theater. Thank you. Yes. Cause what are they doing? It's like being at

51
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:26,560
McDonald's. There's a guy over there taking notes and talking into a tiny tape recorder.

52
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:31,040
Could you please eject him from the theater? There's a real weirdo in there.

53
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:37,280
Note to self. Vaginas seem to like it when you do this stuff to them.

54
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:45,280
Can I seriously, all kidding aside, we all have bigger fucking fish to fry than Fred Willard.

55
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:50,480
Can we please let this man live out his days without this embarrassing ass shit on his record?

56
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:55,600
Another important thing, the thing that I keep coming back to is who the fuck was he hurting?

57
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:00,960
He's a genius and he's done some amazing work.

58
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:06,400
I think we were all just a little disappointed because we expect this kind of behavior from you,

59
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:12,320
Gene Levy. Fred Willard, Fred Willard, I don't know. I guess he seems a little bit more wholesome

60
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:16,640
than Eugene Levy in my mind. Somebody tells me this happens to Eugene Levy. My first reaction

61
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:24,480
is, again? Yeah. Yeah. Is it Thursday already? Because Eugene Levy always masturbates on

62
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:27,680
Thursdays. Is that what you're saying? Why do you know this? Why do you know this about him?

63
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:34,560
Do you not read his blog? I don't. He's like a Batman villain. The most ineffectual

64
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:40,640
crime spree in the world. Leave Fred Willard alone. This is an advice show. My advice,

65
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:47,840
leave Fred Willard alone. But we've got a lot of other people to advise. Let's hop right in.

66
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:54,000
My wife and I are leaving town for a week and a half and some friends of ours have agreed to come

67
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:59,200
and stay in our house to keep an eye on our puppy and whatnot. Should we have them sleep on our bed

68
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:04,640
or on our guest room futon? Our bedroom is the only room with an air conditioner, but we weren't

69
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:13,360
sure if that would be weird. That's from Troubled in Toronto. You can tell them, you can tell them

70
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:17,520
to sleep wherever you want to. If your bed's the most comfortable room in the house, that's where

71
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:21,520
they're going. Yeah. You'll never know. I mean, it's not like they're afraid of you checking in.

72
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:27,920
Yeah. They're gonna go wherever's most comfortable. Yeah, human beings are basically like, like

73
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:35,040
cockroaches. Exactly. Yeah, they're gonna go where the warmth and the comfort is. Just let them sleep

74
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:40,240
on your bed. The fear here is that they're gonna, they're just gonna get it on in your bed. And

75
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:45,040
this is the kind of fear that is destroying Fred Willard right now. People are gonna fuck. It's

76
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:52,000
part of life. You came from fuck. You came from fucking. Just calm down. From fuck you came to

77
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:59,040
fuck. You shall return. Exactly. If you're lucky. I think they're worried about it being weird for

78
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:04,640
the other person too. This is pretty easy. You change the sheets and you say, hey, we put fresh

79
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:12,080
sheets on the bed. They don't have any of our sex on them. So if you could do the same when you leave,

80
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:18,480
just leave the sheets on a sex file. But that is giving them permission to just like, just do have

81
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:25,680
sex. And then when you're, when the act comes to perfect blissful fruition, just, just, just

82
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:34,240
everywhere. Just go buck fucking wild. Just really express yourself. I like fucking Jackson Pollock

83
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:39,840
this sheet up. Go for it. And then hang it on the wall for your friends to see you and then return.

84
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:45,040
Yeah. Signed in the bottom corner. Hey, troubled in Toronto. Why do you have so many homeless

85
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:50,480
friends? Why do you know two homeless people that'll come to your home and just camp out?

86
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:55,120
What's up with these squatters that you're friends with? I've known people before that have like

87
00:08:55,120 --> 00:09:01,280
house set and like it involves spending the night at the house, even though they only live like four

88
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:07,520
miles away from the house. Yeah. Like go make sure everything's cool. Then go home, sleep,

89
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:12,400
come back in the morning. Yeah. Or else you need to get a, you need to get a chain going where

90
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:16,480
somebody has to come house hit for you. Exactly. It seems like it creates a lot of vacancies.

91
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:24,640
This is after watching, um, doomsday preppers enough. I, I, this is not an issue for me. I'm

92
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:29,520
at any moment ready to just walk around my house, flip a switch and just shut it down.

93
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:35,520
Yeah. Completely secure from the outside world. Shut it down. With that plan,

94
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:39,760
do you have like the three things you would grab and get out? No, I have a bug out bag.

95
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:45,680
Do you just keep your cat in there or what? Is this, is this a, is this a real show?

96
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:52,400
Okay. Yes, it is. Okay. You should listen to the hit TV podcast satellite dish with Justin Sidney.

97
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:56,720
We talk about it, but anyway, uh, yeah, it's a real show. People have these, uh,

98
00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:03,520
they're ready for the black Swan event. That's going to, uh, upset the balance. Is that,

99
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:08,080
is the black Swan ready for black Swan on blue Ray? Is that the rogue planet one?

100
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:14,720
Is that where a rogue planet black Swan is basically any like, Oh, like slow mo

101
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:21,520
bad news bears sweeping across the, the, uh, the planet. Yeah. But like if they made a sequel to

102
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:27,760
the remake of bad news bears, that would be a black and you know, Brendan Fraser's the coach,

103
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:31,600
you know, he is, I just got to chill. I just got to actual chill.

104
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:37,040
I can't tell if that was fear or because it was fucking movie magic. A little bit of both,

105
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:41,440
a little bit of both green light. It was safe. Green light. It, this might be the end of the

106
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:45,520
world is like when it was like when the super collider first got going, people are like,

107
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:50,320
what's it going to do? Change science forever or obliterate everything or make Brendan Fraser

108
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:57,840
have a third comeback. Uh-huh. How many changes to God particle, buddy? Can we take, can we take

109
00:10:57,840 --> 00:11:03,600
one of Brendan Fraser's fucking career nine lives and just give one to Fred Willard?

110
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:11,440
Can we float him a, a career second chance from, from old phrase? Cause I think he's had enough.

111
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:19,600
You're right. Brendan Fraser gets more second chances than he's on his like six or seven

112
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:25,120
chance. The dude makes monkey bone and someone in Hollywood goes, Oh, he can do better. Come on.

113
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:33,600
Come on. Just think of his other work. Like Georgia, the no Adam and he, no journey to no

114
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:40,240
mommy eight. No, wait, wait. God's and monsters. Oh yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Serene McKellen. That was

115
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:45,520
really good. Let's get another shot at an Encino man. He's a pretty good in the one episode of

116
00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:53,680
scrubs. It's ever on TV where he's the brother with leukemia. Yeah. Spoilers. Sorry. Sorry.

117
00:11:53,680 --> 00:12:01,840
Sorry. 2003. I ruined your episode of scrubs. Is our next episode going to open up with us

118
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:08,400
starting the Brendan Fraser defense fund? What is Brendan Fraser doing now? That's my

119
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:14,640
mastermating in Fred Willard's home. Yeah. I had to go to the point of theater. Brendan Fraser

120
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:24,720
was in my jerk room. Three things that go bad after three days, house guests, fish,

121
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:35,760
and Brendan Fraser's come back. That's the name of my cover band. No, it's not blast from the past.

122
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:44,800
Keep it. No, thanks. Oh, put your monkey boat away, Brenda. I'm kind of cause of flooring theater.

123
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:48,400
I'm out of Brendan Fraser movies. You know what I find funny? Just real quick. Brendan Fraser,

124
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:58,320
uh, thing. Wrap up your mommy. Uh, here's a, this Yahoo answer was sent in by, uh,

125
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:06,960
Dirk in it. Thanks. Dirk in it. It's by Yahoo answers user. Uh, Oh joy. Who asks if I go away

126
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:14,160
for two weeks, will my horses forget me? Okay. So I've had my horse for over two years and we built

127
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:18,400
a really strong bond and next week I'm going away for a week, coming back for a couple of days,

128
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:23,040
then going away for another week. And in that time, my friend is going to exercise him. Also,

129
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:27,920
I have a four year old who I've got a pretty strong bond with who she'll be exercising

130
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:31,760
for the first week. I fucking hope they're talking about a four year old horse and not

131
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:36,800
a four year old person. I'm worried that they'll forget me and that they'll prefer my friend to me.

132
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:41,200
I just need some reassurance. Cause sometimes I feel they are the only ones who genuinely like me

133
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:47,680
and I couldn't bear to be chosen over. I'll be seeing the first horse for the couple of days.

134
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:53,680
I'm home BTW. Thank you. X, X, X. Everything takes a real sad turn right there at the end.

135
00:13:53,680 --> 00:14:00,160
Well, well, or right there at the beginning or all throughout. It's pervasive, the sadness.

136
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:06,640
Horses can't tell one person from another. Is that sh- listen, listen. This is fact. No, no,

137
00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:14,160
this is 100% fact. To horses, humans are just lumpy skeletons that bring them carrots.

138
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:20,080
They have no idea where one human ends and another begins. I think they can recognize size,

139
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:23,520
uh, the size and girth of a human. I think they can size them up like that.

140
00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:27,440
Oh yeah, definitely. They gotta tell the difference between like a jockey and a big fat fatty.

141
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:32,960
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Cause, um, yeah, exactly. Um,

142
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:37,200
And they gotta be able to tell when somebody like bends over to pick something up and they're ready

143
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:41,840
to comically be kicked in the bottom and like flung across the room or in the head. Cause

144
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:47,680
horses are awful. Um, I think all animals are out to kill us all the time. That's just like my

145
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:52,000
opinion. It's not, it's probably not any science behind it, but I think everyone,

146
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:55,600
if you really dig deep into your heart and just like really inception those,

147
00:14:55,600 --> 00:15:02,240
those sweet pet memories, you'll know it's the truth. Um, I is, but I, the more I read

148
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:08,800
these fucking horse yahoos, the more I think maybe, maybe horses are on some next level shit.

149
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:15,280
You think that they're the one animal where they're like, they're starting to approach

150
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:20,080
some sort of relationship. Well, let me throw this out. Have you ever been nodded at by a horse?

151
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:26,400
Yeah. It's a beautiful moment when you nod back and you're like, yeah, I know. What's up horse?

152
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:31,200
Um, I guess, I mean, there's some, there's gotta be some biology to it, right? Like you're,

153
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:38,320
the horse is the only animal that you have to put your genitals on. That's true. That's the only

154
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:43,360
one you're forced to. Yeah. Right. There are so many things like just think about the connections

155
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:50,880
like horses have teeth. Humans have teeth. That's interesting. Hmm. What are you hiding? You know,

156
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:58,480
like how about an uncle Sam? I think you got to put your, your junk on the horse to interface with

157
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:04,720
it. Um, that's how you control it by flexing your junk. Yeah, exactly. There's a horse will respond

158
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:11,040
to the slightest shift in junk. Didn't you see avatar? Like that's how that's how it works. When

159
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:16,560
you're up on it, there's like, there's fear, there's danger, but there's also trust. You know

160
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:22,400
what I mean? There's kegels and there's trust and fear and danger and all that blends around. All

161
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:29,360
of that mixes up and I like it. It's straight up Equus. Yeah, right. Chinkle, chinkle, chinkle,

162
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:34,160
guys. I think this is, I think, I think horses might be on some next level shit. They're like

163
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:38,800
the dolphins of the land. They're like land dolphins. They're basically land dolphins.

164
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:44,960
Hey, do you want to go down to land dolphin races and lay some bets? Me neither. That seems inhumane.

165
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:50,480
Let's just let them run free. Why don't we have dolphin races? Just side note. Yes, dolphin races

166
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:54,960
would be fresh. I'd really rather watch that than horse races. I think it's because creating on-sea

167
00:16:54,960 --> 00:17:00,480
seeding is so, is so daunting because everyone who would want to watch dolphins races is fat.

168
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:05,600
So you would, I don't know how you would buoy them. When you call it, you would need like mermaid

169
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:10,720
jockeys probably. See, yeah, if I said dolphin jockey, that kind of sounds like a racist slur,

170
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:17,600
maybe. Yeah. Or like something you call a scuba diver if you don't like know what that is. Very

171
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:24,560
good. Maybe someone, some sort of islander. I don't know. Is it, maybe it's like a, maybe it's

172
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:30,480
like a Tongan racial slur. I don't know. I do not know that that, I don't think it's. It's like

173
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:35,840
somebody who's not from the island. You mean like they put their pineapple on top of their, on top

174
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:40,720
of their beef, you know, like, Oh, you don't put the beef on the pineapple. You dolphin jockey.

175
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:48,240
Yeah. Go back to the mainland. Is that your islander impression Justin? Yeah. You just say

176
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:58,080
everything slow. Go back to the mainland dolphin jockey. You sound like you've lost the ability

177
00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:04,720
to have inflection. Yeah. If like, if the Caribbean had like a deep south and also you were drunk.

178
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:15,680
Take your banana republic polo and your ability to modulate your voice tone back to the mainland

179
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:25,200
dolphin jockey. Now it's becoming like a Charlton Heston islander. It's why he played it. It was

180
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:30,720
the sixties. It was a crazy time. They got Charlton Heston. It was like Genghis Khan and John Wayne,

181
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:36,800
you know, they, they, they got a white man to play an ethnic role. It was highly, highly offensive.

182
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:44,480
Do you guys think that the bigger an animal is, the more your human capacity to love it is expanded?

183
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:51,200
To an extent. Yeah. I don't love elephants all that much. See, I don't love, I'm always

184
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:55,280
taking a T-Rex. I mean like that, that, that scares me. Well, those don't, those don't, and never

185
00:18:55,280 --> 00:19:04,480
existed. If you, I like, you guys remember, do you guys remember operation Dumbo drop? What was

186
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:10,560
the one with Bill Murray? It was operation Dumbo drop. Was it? Yeah. Yeah. Do you remember how much

187
00:19:10,560 --> 00:19:16,560
he fucking loved that elephant? Sure. Not by, at the beginning of course, that elephant was a huge

188
00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:23,440
hindrance to him and his, his way of life. When he was trying to crash on, crash parties and like

189
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:29,200
sleep on people's couches across the country and just like hang out. Uh-huh. You know he's coming

190
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:34,880
to Austin, right? Oh, I'm, I'm gonna fucking hunt that down. Dumbo? Yeah. No, no, Bill Murray. No,

191
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:40,000
that elephant's dead as fuck. Elephants have a lifespan of like three years. Yeah, it's weird.

192
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:45,760
They're like lightning bugs. Um, I'm saying maybe that's what's up with horses is that like I could

193
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:51,200
never love my cat as much as I could love a horse because they're, they're so much bigger that they're,

194
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:55,120
they're, I don't know, they're more of a friend. But that has limits, right? Like, okay, so you've

195
00:19:55,120 --> 00:20:01,680
got free Willy. I can concede that point, but when you get up to like the blue whale level, I think

196
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:09,520
it becomes harder to sort of. You're saying there's a bell curve for animal size and love. The perfect

197
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:15,120
size at which you can love an animal is a horse. Yeah. As it becomes bigger than a horse or smaller

198
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:21,360
than a horse, you love it less. Does that horse is like the most you can love something? I think so.

199
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:33,600
Yeah. Yes. Including other people. Yes. Okay. Now we're getting somewhere. And also, by the way, before we go

200
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:38,480
any further, a horse is the most you can love something. It's a bumper sticker trademark of

201
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:46,480
my brother, my brother and me. So for, for you, uh, you, you amateur, uh, horse riders, uh, don't,

202
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:52,960
don't, uh, don't steal that from us. Also, we, we've taken, uh, my other car is a horse. I'd rather be

203
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:59,600
horsing, and, uh, my horse is smarter than your honor roll student. Uh, that's good. We also have the

204
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:07,280
rights to just horsing around. That's J-E-S apostrophe and J-U-S apostrophe. Just horse around. We do not

205
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:15,920
own the rights to J-U-S-T horsing around. That is, of course, owned by horses. Those damn

206
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:22,400
entrepreneurial horses. Horses. Um, I don't travel all that often, but I found it odd that the last

207
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:28,080
hotel I stayed in, there was a spot on the bill for tipping the maids who clean the room. Is this

208
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:34,880
a thing? Do people do this? I've never left a tip at a hotel in my life. Am I good? That's from

209
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:39,760
confused, confused cheapskate in California. You're probably not good. No. You're not good.

210
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:44,000
You probably tipped wrong. No matter how much you put down, you either put too much or not enough,

211
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:47,040
or you didn't do it at all, or you weren't supposed to do it and you look stupid.

212
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:52,560
Tipping is- That's how I feel. Every time- Yeah. The last time I went and got, like, an expensive

213
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:58,560
haircut because, damn it, I'm worth it, I- there was a line for, like, tipping, and I had this moment

214
00:21:58,560 --> 00:22:02,400
where I looked at the lady. Oh, you definitely, definitely, you definitely tip a haircut. Yeah,

215
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:06,160
but I didn't know how much was appropriate. Twenty percent. It was a very nice place.

216
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:10,480
Tipping's a trap. Tipping is a trap to make you feel stupid. We've talked, we've talked about

217
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:14,480
tipping a lot, so I don't want to, I don't want to belabor this question too much, but

218
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:20,400
if you're just, if you're going to do anything ever, Google it and find out if you're supposed

219
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:25,040
to tip or not. Yeah. I would just leave, leave some expensive jewelry out on the counter in

220
00:22:25,040 --> 00:22:29,280
your room so the maids know that that's their tip, and they can just, like, take it when they clean.

221
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:35,120
Hey, who's such a gay boy here? He must want me to take it. I, I, uh, I actually had a situation

222
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:41,440
that came in handy real, uh, last weekend. I was in, uh, Dayton with some friends, and

223
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:46,720
we did bad things to a hotel room. We kind of messed it up, and I kind of spilled some wine on

224
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:53,600
the sheets, and it got a little hairy in there, and so I handed the maid a generous tip as she

225
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:58,640
went into the room. You fucking paid her off to forget you were there. So I paid her off to keep

226
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:05,040
a secret. Now let me revise that story with the truth. Uh, Sydney gave the maid a generous tip,

227
00:23:05,040 --> 00:23:09,600
and I, no bullshit, saw the maid was coming down the hallway and turned around and hid in the

228
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:13,600
elevator because I was so embarrassed of the room's condition. Now, can I ask what you,

229
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:18,560
you're not the fucking... She was going down, then the maid went in the room, she saw the room,

230
00:23:18,560 --> 00:23:22,800
she made some snide comments that I heard from down the hall, and then the maid went to go get

231
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:27,360
a pillow and bring it back to the room, and I, unwilling to hide in the hallway anymore, went

232
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:32,960
into our room and hid under the table, uh, hoping that she would not see me and connect me with

233
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:37,520
those other people that messed up that hotel room so bad. He's actually recording from under said

234
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:45,600
table right now. I am still under the table. You are not the fucking wild stallion type. I have to

235
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:53,120
know what you did to this room. There was just so many bottles! I'm boring, but like, I know cool

236
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:58,800
people. So, like, there was a lot of drinking, a lot of carousing. Like I said, I spilled...

237
00:23:58,800 --> 00:24:01,840
You can't just say carousing! What is that? Are you guys having a fucking...? I bought a bottle

238
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:07,040
of something called Raise the Glass to the Bacchanalian Gods. Yeah, like, I bought a...

239
00:24:07,040 --> 00:24:10,640
This is the kind of night it was. I bought, before we went, I bought a bottle of something called

240
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:17,040
Adult Chocolate Milk. Like, that was literally what it was called, and we drank that, and we

241
00:24:17,040 --> 00:24:21,440
played some music and danced, you know, like young people do. Like, this is what young people do.

242
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:28,960
You fell asleep by 1115. It was four, but yes, basically. I tried to fall asleep, and every...

243
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:33,280
The blow would keep me awake. There was no blow. I wish... I don't know how to avoid it by that.

244
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:39,200
I just assume you met people punching you in the face. No. But yeah, like, I paid her off, so

245
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:44,480
if you feel bad about what you did in your hotel room, tips are really good, because it's like,

246
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:51,200
hey, sorry. I think... The same thing applies if you house it for a friend and you bone in their

247
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:56,800
bed. Hand them a 20 on your way out the door for dry cleaning. I don't know that this is dependent

248
00:24:56,800 --> 00:25:02,560
on how much your room costs, but I kind of feel like, I don't know, like a five dollar tip per

249
00:25:02,560 --> 00:25:08,880
night is like, is good. That seems fair to me, right? I mean, I don't know actually how you

250
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:14,720
figure it out. I don't know what the recommended is. I am going into the fucking lion's mouth

251
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:23,360
of this issue next month, because my girlfriend and I are staying at a fancy all-inclusive resort

252
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:28,960
in Playa del Carmen, so it's all-inclusive. Everything's paid for, so I'm not going to have

253
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:34,800
that 20 percent rule to guide me on tips, because you've got to still tip people. You know what I

254
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:39,760
mean? Yeah, you just need like a pocket full of bills, and then stop handing them to them.

255
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:45,760
Literally. Take their hand away. Except I'm gonna be chilling in the pool all the time,

256
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:49,840
and on the beach, so I can't have like a pocket full of bills. I gotta have like a waterproof

257
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:56,240
fanny pack, and that's not a good luck. Right. You know, if you find yourself having questions

258
00:25:56,240 --> 00:26:03,600
about this, I recommend the How Stuff Works episode, Stuff You Should Know How Tipping Works.

259
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:09,280
Boom. Yeah. Helped. Consider yourself helped. I mean, I know how it fucking works. I take money

260
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:13,200
out of my pocket that's more additional. He wasn't talking to you, dullard. Yeah, Griffin,

261
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:16,960
and I'm also not talking about the process of removing bills from a wallet. That's what I'm

262
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:20,560
saying. You take the money out, and you give it to the man, even though you already gave him

263
00:26:20,560 --> 00:26:23,920
money before. It's so fucking... You have the monies, and then you give away monies, and then

264
00:26:23,920 --> 00:26:26,960
you don't have the monies no more. It's not my fault that they pay you like a joke. Work to

265
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:33,040
earn more monies. Right. You should demand better wages. I will help you unionize, but this five-ski

266
00:26:33,040 --> 00:26:38,640
is mine. What kills me... Well, we've talked about tipping enough, but what kills me is coffee shops

267
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:41,520
where I have no idea how much they're actually getting paid, and I think I'm always getting

268
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:45,440
ripped off. I think it's a dupe. I just like to get my money away. I think it's a worldwide dupe.

269
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:49,280
I think everyone who works at... I mean, I can't even go on with this bit. I have friends who work

270
00:26:49,280 --> 00:26:53,840
in restaurants that are gonna burn my fucking house down. Hey, I just checked. It's one to two

271
00:26:53,840 --> 00:27:00,480
dollars for a bad hotel, three to five dollars for a good one. But don't wait until the last night,

272
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:05,920
because different people will clean your room. So leave a couple bucks or a few bucks out,

273
00:27:05,920 --> 00:27:10,720
and leave it somewhere prominent so they'll be sure to know it's not just stealing.

274
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:16,160
Like, tape it right next to the wine stains you left all over the bed and wherever you spilled

275
00:27:16,160 --> 00:27:20,560
your adult chocolate milk. Put a dollar by every adult chocolate milk stain like you're fucking

276
00:27:20,560 --> 00:27:36,560
cataloging a crime scene. Speaking of money, money time. Okay.

277
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:50,000
Friends, every Friday at 10 pm on the IFC, you are going to tune in for Comedy Bang Bang. It's

278
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:54,800
this absurd half-hour comedy show. It only looks like a talk show. It's got Scott Ackerman. I know

279
00:27:54,800 --> 00:28:00,240
you're wondering, is the Ack there? He is. Reggie Watts? You betcha. They got great guests like Amy

280
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:07,360
Poehler, Zach Galifianakis, and Seth Rogen. This Friday, they got Elizabeth Banks, and one of the

281
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:14,720
special guests this week is Polly Shore. So maybe they can find out what the phrase is up to from

282
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:20,400
Polly. It's comedy so nice they banged it twice this Friday and every Friday at 10 pm on IFC

283
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:26,320
Comedy Bang Bang. I want to talk about Squarespace. It's a website where you can create your own

284
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:31,920
website or blog in minutes. It's now super easy to use. They've got all new beautiful templates.

285
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:39,520
They've got a really responsive design. Your website will scale to display on any device.

286
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:48,720
What about web Skype? iOS, browser, Game Boy, advanced SP. They've got an award-winning support

287
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:55,280
team. Go to Squarespace.com. Our listeners get 10% off by using the offer code MyBrother7. That's

288
00:28:55,280 --> 00:29:01,040
MySpaceBrother space and then the number seven. Go check it out. Building websites is difficult,

289
00:29:01,040 --> 00:29:11,920
but Squarespace can lead you through the desert to the sweet oasis of website success. That was a

290
00:29:11,920 --> 00:29:18,720
beautiful analogy. I was about to goof on that, but it's really evocative. I can see it in my

291
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:26,960
mind's eye, you know? Yeah, that's me. I paint pictures with my words that hang in the air.

292
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:34,640
Oh, fuck. I can taste it there. Yeah. I can taste the pictures that you said with words.

293
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:42,800
I'm on Salvia. It should be noted. We should do an all Salvia episode. It would last four minutes

294
00:29:42,800 --> 00:29:47,520
and it would be fucking bananas. It'd just be full of screaming. Don't suggest that to people

295
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:52,000
because then that'll be all we hear about. Oh, we got that Salvia app. Never. Never. I'm

296
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:57,840
never doing that. We'll do our Salvia app and our D&D app on the same day. It'll be great.

297
00:29:58,560 --> 00:30:04,240
Special bonus, subscribers only. Kickstart that. Kickstart our Dungeons and Dragons Salvia app.

298
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:11,440
Everybody, guys. Everybody. Someday we will look back on this time in American history and think,

299
00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:17,680
God, I wish I kickstarted something. Yeah. Man, I wish I got on that gravy train. I keep thinking

300
00:30:17,680 --> 00:30:26,000
like what we should do is kickstart a UK tour for my brother and my brother and me and it's like,

301
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:29,680
who would pay for that? Well, people who come to it. Okay. But I think that at this point in

302
00:30:29,680 --> 00:30:34,560
history, people will pay for anything. Yeah. They just like the idea of us doing it so they'll pay

303
00:30:34,560 --> 00:30:40,160
for it. I think a UK tour would even demand too much work from our end. I think that we could

304
00:30:40,160 --> 00:30:49,920
shoot a lot lower and have our ROI, you know, really, really synergize our ROI. I completely

305
00:30:49,920 --> 00:30:54,080
understood that. Yeah, portfolios. How would you synergize the return on investment for this? Oh,

306
00:30:54,080 --> 00:31:00,560
you know, gross national product. Oh, okay. What you have to do is you have to minimize your loss

307
00:31:00,560 --> 00:31:09,360
risk while increasing your stocks, your stocks. Now, would you diversify that, Griffin? No, no,

308
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:14,240
no. That's it. That buzzword was only applicable in the nineties. You got to synergize it. Don't

309
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:21,200
diversify. You want one big good thing. Do you emulsify it? You emulsify it in a tray of butter

310
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:28,400
for about 25 to 30 minutes. Don't over emulsify. I cannot wait until my equity matures.

311
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:37,120
I can't wait till we mature. Hey, razor choices, electric or manual from Gmail. I love it. Short,

312
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:43,760
it's sweet. Short, sweet, to the point. And I am a big believer in the wet shave with a safety

313
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:51,600
razor. That's what our pod father, Jesse Thorn, suggested on the grooming episode of Put This On.

314
00:31:52,400 --> 00:31:58,720
And it's a method that I have come to really, really enjoy. Is a safety razor like safety

315
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:03,120
scissors? No. Yeah, it's like a safety pop. It's one of those lollipops with the hoop on it so

316
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:10,160
the dumb kids can't swallow it. It's a funny name actually because it's like safety compared to

317
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:16,240
a straight razor, but compared to like all other razors, it's wicked dangerous. It is safe

318
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:20,240
compared to shaving with a fucking Claymore, to shaving with a broadsword.

319
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:27,520
But I've never experienced any bad cuts. And it turns shaving into a bit more a ritual. I mean,

320
00:32:27,520 --> 00:32:36,320
you got to get a brush and you got to lather up and you've got to make it all nice and smooth

321
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:41,920
on your face. You usually do a couple of passes, but it's worth it. It's easier on my skin. As a

322
00:32:41,920 --> 00:32:48,240
bearded gentleman, I go with the electric because it's better for trimming. Sure. And then also,

323
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:53,120
I have a very sensitive neck and the manual just gives me the razor burn. The electric,

324
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:57,600
no problem. Travis, the electric eats your face. Your neck is looking a little fat lately.

325
00:32:58,480 --> 00:33:03,360
How dare you? I'm just saying. I've been doing neck kegels. Okay.

326
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:14,800
My neck is as tight as an 18 year old's. Oh God. Do you know what I do? What? I do electric

327
00:33:14,800 --> 00:33:23,440
on the weekdays and I go straight razor on the weekends. I like that. I like that. It keeps it

328
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:27,840
from being too much of a chore, too much of a routine. The problem, I used to be all straight

329
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:32,720
razor because Justin got me that for my birthday, I think. And I really like it, but the problem is

330
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:37,920
that it takes a while. It takes like three times as long. It's just like dragging a Mach 3 across

331
00:33:37,920 --> 00:33:45,520
your stupid face. Wait, just so I'm clear, when you say electric, do you mean like a vibrating

332
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:50,400
Mach 3? I mean a vibrator. I just rub like a vibrator that I got from Extreme Restraints

333
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:56,080
across my face until the hair- You're not talking about those crazy spinning circular

334
00:33:56,080 --> 00:34:01,120
blades, right? We can all agree that's crazy. No, that's- No, I've got like a beard trimmer set.

335
00:34:01,120 --> 00:34:09,840
Yeah. I shouldn't have to say this. You shouldn't put some sort of alien thresher on your grill,

336
00:34:09,840 --> 00:34:17,840
you dumbo. Don't put that there ever. Shave it. What the fuck do those vibrating razors accomplish,

337
00:34:17,840 --> 00:34:22,800
by the way? When your skin goes like, oh, that's nice. I'm going to stick the hair out farther.

338
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:30,720
Yeah. It arouses the hairs. Yeah. It gives your hair a boner. Yeah. I was just ready for like

339
00:34:30,720 --> 00:34:36,080
everybody in the world to simultaneously realize that that was bullshit. No, Doug, I swear to God,

340
00:34:36,080 --> 00:34:42,800
it's all I can use. I swear to God, you can't go back on that. It gets your shit so smooth.

341
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:48,960
What are you talking about, Griff? That vibrating Mach 4 or 5. Oh, that is so good. I mean,

342
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:55,760
when I was using, back in the day, when I was still using those kind of multi-edge razors,

343
00:34:55,760 --> 00:35:03,600
the vibrating Mach 3 is a fine choice. It's a treat. It's a real treat. I like the beard trimmer

344
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:08,720
because the electric, I can set it at a line and just use such a clean line all the way across.

345
00:35:08,720 --> 00:35:13,360
Yeah. And use it at the same time to keep my beard manageable and not looking like a wizard.

346
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:21,600
First off, you should really chase that look. I do it my way because it's fast on the weekdays

347
00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:28,400
when it's working time. And then on the weekends, I can luxuriate. I'll take a nice, long, hot shower

348
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:38,720
and then luxuriate with a 15-minute wet shave. It's like a sharp massage. It's real good.

349
00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:46,000
The only other problem with wet shaving is when you're traveling. Yeah, there's a lot of accoutrement.

350
00:35:46,640 --> 00:35:51,440
Well, the accoutrement is not as much the problem as the fact that you can't bring razors.

351
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:57,120
If you're doing carry-on, you can't bring a safety razor with you. There's no context in which they

352
00:35:57,120 --> 00:36:03,200
are cool with it. I've gotten it through once or twice just leaving it in the razor, but they are

353
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:09,840
very... Because it is like a... I mean, it is a... It's dangerous, yeah. It's a short knife. I really

354
00:36:09,840 --> 00:36:19,120
want to bring back the Sweeney Todd style straight razor. Can I do that? I'm sure there's a hipster

355
00:36:19,120 --> 00:36:26,160
hipster doing it somewhere. No, I want to do it unironically. Too late. Everything is ironic. It's

356
00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:33,920
2012. Fuck. Griffin, hit me. Here's a Yahoo. This Yahoo was sent in by Brett Townsend. Thank you,

357
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:39,280
Brett. It's by Yahoo Insta user Tori Bailey who asks, how can I ask my gynecologist out?

358
00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:44,560
Actually, he is not my gyno. My doctor transferred me there because of my enlarged ovary.

359
00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:47,840
We are trying to find out what is wrong with my bladder and he keeps sending me back. I had a

360
00:36:47,840 --> 00:36:54,320
pelvic exam once and I kind of liked it, but before that, we was talking and laughing. I noticed we

361
00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:58,960
both looked back at each other when it was over. He was kind of checking me out. I was scared to

362
00:36:58,960 --> 00:37:02,480
look back because I didn't want him to think I liked him then. I attracted to him a lot and he's

363
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:05,760
so cute. I just went today and he wanted to do an exam again, but my little sister was with me,

364
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:11,920
so he rescheduled it. IDK. Yeah, he was checking you out. Literally. When he did the exam, I was

365
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:18,240
nervous because I was laughing when he was inside me. It kind of tickled. Is this Fifty Shades of

366
00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:23,760
Grey? This is what Fifty Shades of Grey is about. I can't go on with this question. I can't either.

367
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:32,480
How do you, I'm sorry ladies, but how do you maintain the mystique in a dating relationship

368
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:40,240
when the guy has already gotten to eighth base? Not only that, but in the most clinically detached

369
00:37:40,240 --> 00:37:49,440
way. He has cartographed your vagina to an extent that he is bored with it forever. Right. He

370
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:57,200
literally knows you better than you know yourself. He has drawn a depth map of every molecule of your

371
00:37:57,200 --> 00:38:06,640
bathing suit area. He has carved his initials into your cervix. He could find your uterus with his

372
00:38:06,640 --> 00:38:14,000
eyes closed. I don't think it will. What is the practical effort? God, where's that uterus?

373
00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:22,080
Oh no, the power's out. Yeah. It's the black swan. I need a place to hide. Let me get up in

374
00:38:22,080 --> 00:38:30,960
that enlarged uterus. Oh man. Yeah, I could see this. I could see this being an issue.

375
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:40,880
That's like me saying I'd like to ask out the poor young doctor who had to give me,

376
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:46,480
you know, stick his finger up my butt. Oh man. That poor guy. But see if the roles,

377
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:50,960
I feel like if the roles were reversed. No one has to get prostate exams anymore. Sydney just

378
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:55,680
told me that's the new thing. That's not true. No more prostate exams. It's fine. You don't need

379
00:38:55,680 --> 00:39:00,480
to get them. Now it's a lot more anecdotal. It's like, so how's your prostate? And you say,

380
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:06,160
it's good. It's good. It seems good. It feels fine. I don't actually know that was true.

381
00:39:06,160 --> 00:39:09,120
That I was sort of half listening. It can't be true. Go get your prostate

382
00:39:09,120 --> 00:39:15,360
checks right now. Even if you're 15. I think, I think if the roles were reversed. Make sure it's

383
00:39:15,360 --> 00:39:21,360
a doctor. This is a female doctor, a female penis doctor. I feel like there wasn't any mystery there

384
00:39:21,360 --> 00:39:27,760
to begin with. Everyone knows how that works. The vagina is like inside you and it's like a maze.

385
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:33,440
It's like a hedge maze with a minotaur in the middle of it. And the minotaur is pleasure.

386
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:37,280
You took a hard left there. The anger. Fred Willard is listening to this podcast right

387
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:44,720
now. Just jerking off his wiener. Hopefully for the privacy of his own Starbucks on the corner.

388
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:50,640
I don't think there's any way you can have that conversation with somebody. I do not think,

389
00:39:50,640 --> 00:39:55,680
I think when you have a person inside you, you can't clinically. When a person is in you

390
00:39:55,680 --> 00:40:02,000
clinically, there's no way to flirt. Wait, how about this? Hey, time out.

391
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:06,560
Why don't we finish this over drinks later? Yeah. Yeah. If a person is in you clinically,

392
00:40:06,560 --> 00:40:12,000
the bigger concern is that you'll flirt. That's the big, hey, why don't you do this?

393
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:16,640
Why don't you look at him and say, you've seen the trailer. Are you ready for the presentation?

394
00:40:19,120 --> 00:40:22,880
And if he's not down with that, he was never meant to be because he's not a cool dude.

395
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:29,840
Oh God. You're going to just keep coming to the open house or are you going to make an offer?

396
00:40:29,840 --> 00:40:35,760
Yeah. You're going to keep trying to sample nuggets. You can get an eight pack. You sicko.

397
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:44,880
Oh God. You're going to keep taking these sampler platters to springtime Oreos.

398
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:48,560
You're just going to go buy a package. That happened to me last week. It was awesome.

399
00:40:48,560 --> 00:40:56,640
Oh God. I don't think you can. I don't think you can tell if a person likes you or not.

400
00:40:57,680 --> 00:41:06,400
When they're when they're up ends. Yeah. There's no signal. There's they can't send you signals

401
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:11,040
or maybe they can. Maybe guy knows like I've never. Oh, don't don't. No, no, no. I'm just

402
00:41:11,040 --> 00:41:15,120
saying. I'm just saying there's got to be a fucking smooth ass gynecologist out there.

403
00:41:15,120 --> 00:41:20,720
There has to be Jude Law PhD and he's up in you and he gives you a look and you're like,

404
00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:28,000
holy shit. Like, I think this dude, I think it might be on. This is happening. This is happening

405
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:33,680
for real. It seems everything checks out. And on a personal note, nice, nice stuff.

406
00:41:33,680 --> 00:41:41,040
Nicely done. Good stuff. All of you. You cannot lose with the stuff you use. I really enjoyed that.

407
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:47,680
I really enjoyed that. Personally speak clinically speaking. I listen from a professional standpoint.

408
00:41:47,680 --> 00:41:56,720
Neat Hyman. Is that the first time you said Hyman on the show? Yeah. Confetti shot out of my mind.

409
00:41:56,720 --> 00:42:03,760
This should be. I've got a banner hanging up. They just felt like you've the banner just says you've

410
00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:11,120
the banner just says you've said all the words. All the words that you should not say. You've said all

411
00:42:11,120 --> 00:42:17,360
of them. You said all the words. I've got a little checklist here. Let's see. Mons pubis. Yep.

412
00:42:20,320 --> 00:42:27,680
Smegma. Smegma. No. Yeah. Yeah. Episode 17. Smegma. And then Griffin, you said jizz earlier. Yeah,

413
00:42:27,680 --> 00:42:34,800
I did. Check that. Labia. Labia. Yep. Hey, my friend is trying to get me to go to a hip-hop

414
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:40,480
dance class. I can't dance. I don't know anything about hip-hop. How do I lame out of the situation?

415
00:42:40,480 --> 00:42:46,320
Or should I put on my Nikes and just do it? P.S. I don't have Nikes. That's for Mindy in Columbus,

416
00:42:46,320 --> 00:42:51,520
Ohio. Step one. Get some Nikes. Get some Nikes. Hey, let me throw this out guys.

417
00:42:51,520 --> 00:42:57,600
This 20 does. If someone asked you to go to a hip-hop dance class, if someone asked me,

418
00:42:57,600 --> 00:43:03,200
I'd probably do it once. You do it once. Don't ever do it again if you don't dig it. But like,

419
00:43:03,200 --> 00:43:07,040
how will you know if you don't like hip-hop dance classes? It sounds like- Also, if your friend is

420
00:43:07,040 --> 00:43:13,680
persistent, going once gives you an out later to be like, no, I went and tried that and it was bad

421
00:43:13,680 --> 00:43:17,520
and I don't want to do it again. I hated that. Because if you don't go, they're just gonna keep

422
00:43:17,520 --> 00:43:24,480
asking. When you say no, three months from now, you guys are at the club, your friend starts

423
00:43:24,480 --> 00:43:33,440
fucking krumping so hard. Losing it. So hard that like- Dance battle erupts. People are physically-

424
00:43:33,440 --> 00:43:38,640
You've got to pop and lock for your territory. People are being pushed back by the krump waves

425
00:43:38,640 --> 00:43:42,880
that are coming off of your friend because they're just pounding it so fucking hard.

426
00:43:42,880 --> 00:43:48,080
They're krumping and you're kramping. Yeah. Their style. Just by being there. Just do it.

427
00:43:48,080 --> 00:43:54,720
You might like it. Now, I do have to say, I'm being very positive about this. If I'm at a hip-hop

428
00:43:54,720 --> 00:44:00,880
dance class, the first time the teacher's like, Justin, can you pop that and or lock it a little

429
00:44:00,880 --> 00:44:05,680
harder? I'm like, I'm out skis. My hand's in the air. Justin, you're bruising that move. I need

430
00:44:05,680 --> 00:44:13,760
you to bust it. I need to stop you both right here because I don't think either of you have watched

431
00:44:13,760 --> 00:44:19,840
a hip-hop music video in the past 15 fucking years because I do not think popping and locking it is

432
00:44:19,840 --> 00:44:26,800
still a thing that is commonplace. I do not think in a new Chris Brown video, people are moving like

433
00:44:26,800 --> 00:44:35,760
robots. Are people still busting a move? That is no, no. Young MC took that one to the fucking grave,

434
00:44:35,760 --> 00:44:43,600
dog. Now put some cardboard on the floor and spin around real fast. Oh yeah, did they do that head

435
00:44:43,600 --> 00:44:50,880
spin thing where like they kind of do it like a tornado? Teacher, would you like to see my tootsie

436
00:44:50,880 --> 00:44:57,600
roll? No, no, I wouldn't because it's fucking 2012. It is not 1999 anymore. I don't need you to

437
00:44:57,600 --> 00:45:04,640
teach me how to Dougie, but I would appreciate some notes on how to improve it. Ah, Charlie Brown.

438
00:45:04,640 --> 00:45:12,800
Nope, it's not. It's super not. Psst, when do we start working on the electric slide? We never did,

439
00:45:12,800 --> 00:45:18,560
never will. Never did that. Can't. It was never a thing. Excuse me, teach. Can you teach me how to

440
00:45:18,560 --> 00:45:22,960
teach? Can you teach me how to do that move of the guy in the fishing hat does where he shakes his

441
00:45:22,960 --> 00:45:31,840
head really fast and it looks like he's vibrating? I think it's in Breaking Two. Teach, teach. When

442
00:45:31,840 --> 00:45:40,400
do we start the partner work with the brooms? What are you talking about? Are you in Fantasia?

443
00:45:42,560 --> 00:45:48,400
Well, no, but now, yes. Teach, pardon me, when do we get the lesson about dancing on

444
00:45:48,400 --> 00:45:54,160
the ceiling? That's going to go on and on. Teach, when do we start the Jamiroquai work?

445
00:45:57,280 --> 00:46:02,720
Now Friday, we have a Jamiroquai workshop. We do have the room where the floor is a giant treadmill,

446
00:46:02,720 --> 00:46:08,480
so everyone, we're going to have a lot of fun. Yeah. Don't bring your bags in, please.

447
00:46:08,480 --> 00:46:13,680
Do not bring your bags, but do bring in your gigantic hats like Mr. Jamiroquai would wear.

448
00:46:14,640 --> 00:46:17,760
Did you guys know that the lead singer of Jamiroquai was just named Jamiroquai and

449
00:46:17,760 --> 00:46:25,120
it was just him? Now, is that true? No. He was actually the last of the Jamiroquai Indians.

450
00:46:25,120 --> 00:46:32,560
Exactly. Oh, Christ. My older sister recently watched Kick-Ass and decided she wants to be

451
00:46:32,560 --> 00:46:37,600
a real-life superhero. I don't want to discourage her, just the opposite. I want to help her get it

452
00:46:37,600 --> 00:46:42,480
in 20 Does, and if that involves helping her dress up in a costume and fight crime, then so be it.

453
00:46:43,200 --> 00:46:46,560
What can I do to help her get ready for her career as a crime fighter?

454
00:46:46,560 --> 00:46:50,880
Also, she hasn't come up with a name or theme for her persona, so any- I'm sorry,

455
00:46:50,880 --> 00:46:55,280
I said persona really bad. Let me try again. Persona. So any and all suggestions will be

456
00:46:55,280 --> 00:47:00,080
welcome. Aiming to be my sister's Alfred is the name of that question to ask her.

457
00:47:00,080 --> 00:47:02,000
First of all, I'm 100% behind this. No.

458
00:47:04,080 --> 00:47:08,320
Okay. See, we got conflicting opinions. This makes for good radio.

459
00:47:08,320 --> 00:47:18,000
It depends on how active your sister wants to be in the crime fighting process. If she wants to

460
00:47:19,680 --> 00:47:27,040
be a watcher, a lookout for crimes, and then contact the authorities,

461
00:47:28,880 --> 00:47:34,320
fucking open a newspaper and find any time where somebody being a vigilante ever turned out to be

462
00:47:34,320 --> 00:47:40,240
a good thing. No, but I think there's things like, you know, walking with people so that

463
00:47:40,240 --> 00:47:46,320
they're not walking by themselves late at night and jumping from rooftop to rooftop.

464
00:47:46,320 --> 00:47:50,320
Okay, but how long- that's going to keep your sister satisfied for maybe three days,

465
00:47:50,320 --> 00:47:54,960
and then she's going to go fucking full-blown George Zimmerman. Like, that's how this arc

466
00:47:54,960 --> 00:48:00,800
terminates. That's the fear. That's not the fear, that's the fucking 100% definite reality,

467
00:48:00,800 --> 00:48:08,000
unavoidable consequence. Okay, first, let us say don't do this. Secondly, when you do,

468
00:48:08,720 --> 00:48:12,960
first thing you gotta get is a taser. That's like a superpower, basically.

469
00:48:12,960 --> 00:48:17,600
Yeah, yeah, and then you tase somebody because you think they're committing a crime. Oops,

470
00:48:17,600 --> 00:48:21,760
they have a heart murmur. Dead. They weren't committing a crime. They were buying a fucking

471
00:48:21,760 --> 00:48:29,520
gumball from a gotcha gotcha machine, you stupid. So I think electric- electric last,

472
00:48:29,520 --> 00:48:34,800
this both way. Electric last is a bad idea. Okay. You know who's a good- you know who's

473
00:48:34,800 --> 00:48:42,160
a good crime fighter? Yell- yell for the cops, girl. Hey, I think this guy's committing a crime.

474
00:48:42,160 --> 00:48:46,240
9-1-1. Cops show up and he's buying a fucking gumball. At least you didn't kill him.

475
00:48:48,800 --> 00:48:51,280
Not like electric last we have in the back of the police car.

476
00:48:51,280 --> 00:49:00,000
Uh, here's the good news. We are a society that now spends 17 hours per day, on average,

477
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:05,360
watching reality television and eating Thai food. That is basically the only two things that any of

478
00:49:05,360 --> 00:49:12,160
us do. We've gone thick- grown thick and slovenly, uh, but from the- from our disuse of our physical

479
00:49:12,160 --> 00:49:19,600
forms. If you take like a spinning class two times a week, you're basically a superhero.

480
00:49:19,600 --> 00:49:26,160
Like you are- if you bother to be even a little bit physically fit, you are- you are

481
00:49:26,160 --> 00:49:32,640
moved to the level of that super- super heroine. I've had a brainstorm. Okay. Okay. What if you

482
00:49:32,640 --> 00:49:38,880
were a non-crime fighting superhero? You were just a lazy superhero? No, no, no. No, no, no.

483
00:49:38,880 --> 00:49:45,440
You were a much more like activist superhero. You were like Recycle Girl or Captain Vegetable. No,

484
00:49:45,440 --> 00:49:50,480
then you're Captain- then you're Captain Fuck Clean-Off. Then you might as well be like,

485
00:49:51,360 --> 00:49:55,920
Sergeant, don't tell me how to live my life because that's- I don't want your guidance.

486
00:49:55,920 --> 00:50:04,640
You're in a leotard. I like Justin's idea of you can be a superhero just by being a little bit

487
00:50:04,640 --> 00:50:08,560
better than everyone else. If you've had a Twitter account for over a year and haven't said something

488
00:50:08,560 --> 00:50:17,520
shitty on it, congrats, Superman. Way to go. Nice- nice willpower there, Hal Jordan. Do you- do you,

489
00:50:17,520 --> 00:50:25,120
uh, never let the people who try to get around traffic jams by scooting up on the berm- if you

490
00:50:25,120 --> 00:50:30,000
never let those people in, you're a superhero. Oh, if you do that like half over the line thing

491
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:34,480
so people can't get around, everyone behind you is like superhero. Yeah, yeah, that guy's a

492
00:50:34,480 --> 00:50:39,040
superhero because he's not letting- Oh, if you have figured out a way to politely honk at someone

493
00:50:39,040 --> 00:50:43,280
who doesn't realize the light has turned green but you don't sound like a dick, you're a superhero.

494
00:50:43,280 --> 00:50:46,720
No, wait, that would- that would be like an inventor-type superhero who invents a horn

495
00:50:46,720 --> 00:50:51,120
that's just like, uh, excuse me. Pardon? No, no, no, it's more that, like, you found the exact

496
00:50:51,120 --> 00:50:57,440
right length of time to press the horn. Oh, so it's just like- So they're confused? Like,

497
00:50:57,440 --> 00:51:02,400
was that a honk? Oh, the light changed. Oh, hey, oh my. Uh, is this the- is this the honks or hot

498
00:51:02,400 --> 00:51:06,880
line? I need you to come by and honk at somebody. He's been at this green light through 17 lights.

499
00:51:06,880 --> 00:51:11,280
It's- it's been three hours. Oh, he's might be dead. Hold on, yeah, oh yeah, he's dead.

500
00:51:11,280 --> 00:51:12,880
He's dead. God damn it, electric glass.

501
00:51:16,560 --> 00:51:20,960
This car is stolen, bazaap. Oh, wait, uh, fuck.

502
00:51:26,640 --> 00:51:29,600
I'm willing to bet that in real life there's not a lot of banter.

503
00:51:29,600 --> 00:51:36,320
Yeah, there's not like- Stop right- I don't want to stop, I'm a criminal. There's the banter. I

504
00:51:36,320 --> 00:51:40,720
want- I want to keep robbing. God damn it. I want to keep robbing people because I'm a robber.

505
00:51:42,240 --> 00:51:49,280
This is what I like doing. I like- I like to rob people and steal their things and have them for

506
00:51:49,280 --> 00:51:54,960
myself without working for them. Whenever I see somebody doing anything wrong, not even like a

507
00:51:54,960 --> 00:52:01,040
crime, but like, I don't know, they roll past the stop sign too fast. My immediate reaction is not

508
00:52:01,040 --> 00:52:08,320
like, what's wrong buddy, can't read? It's always like, oh fuck, fuck, oh god, oh god. Oh, here,

509
00:52:08,320 --> 00:52:13,920
I've got a great persona. Okay. Boomerang lass, because when you see something happening, you go

510
00:52:13,920 --> 00:52:20,800
away and come back later and they're gone. Yeah, that's- hey, what's up, I'm bad Samaritan.

511
00:52:20,800 --> 00:52:30,320
You could just hang around the grocery store and like help people. I'll tell you the superhero I

512
00:52:30,320 --> 00:52:35,840
need. I need cooking suggestion superhero. I'm like looking at three different kinds of pasta.

513
00:52:35,840 --> 00:52:40,480
Just tell me what fucking pesto to get so I can get out of here. I don't know anything about pesto

514
00:52:40,480 --> 00:52:45,360
sauce. Help me. That's a superhero I could get behind. Sure. What about a superhero that always

515
00:52:45,360 --> 00:52:51,280
helped me find a convenient parking space? I don't exactly know how that would work, but let's workshop.

516
00:52:51,280 --> 00:52:57,360
In Austin, in Austin, on some of the busier streets, homeless people will help you. They'll

517
00:52:57,360 --> 00:53:02,560
just like stand on the side of the, like they'll stand on a corner and just like point you to where

518
00:53:02,560 --> 00:53:08,480
an open parking space is. Really? Yeah. That's awesome. And I always, and then they come up to

519
00:53:08,480 --> 00:53:12,000
you and they're like, hey man, you're like, hey, you know, give me, give me some money. Because

520
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:17,120
they basically just valeted for you. And then you, and then you say, you actually, I'm going to give

521
00:53:17,120 --> 00:53:22,720
you something better than that. I think you're a superhero. Bye. Put a cape on. Yeah. I'm super

522
00:53:22,720 --> 00:53:32,320
hungry. Yeah. Bye. Bye. I think you're a hero. In my book, flat you man. I think you're a hero.

523
00:53:33,680 --> 00:53:37,440
Captain ill-fitting charity t-shirt. You're my number one hero.

524
00:53:37,440 --> 00:53:44,720
When I, when I worked at GameStop once, I got robbed at gunpoint and before they robbed me,

525
00:53:44,720 --> 00:53:48,320
they asked if we had any PlayStation threes in stock. Cause it was right when the PlayStation

526
00:53:48,320 --> 00:53:53,520
three came out and I lied because they had their hoodies pulled up over their faces and their hands

527
00:53:53,520 --> 00:53:57,440
in their pockets. So I knew that robbing was about to happen. And I lied and I said, no,

528
00:53:57,440 --> 00:54:01,440
we don't have any PS threes. And we had a bunch and then they robbed us and took our money,

529
00:54:01,440 --> 00:54:06,880
but not our PlayStation threes. I guess my question is, am I a superhero? Well, you're super dumb.

530
00:54:06,880 --> 00:54:11,120
That was really dumb, but I think maybe really proud of you, but at the end of the day,

531
00:54:11,680 --> 00:54:15,760
they didn't get entertainment. Do you know how long before you were fired from that job?

532
00:54:15,760 --> 00:54:20,960
I wasn't fired. I quit at my own volition. I was awarded the medal of honor from Huntington's mayor.

533
00:54:21,760 --> 00:54:25,840
The GameStop medal of honor. He's like, yo, it's actually just a copy of a medal of honor.

534
00:54:29,600 --> 00:54:33,440
The mayor was like, those guys were trying to, those guys were trying to play,

535
00:54:33,440 --> 00:54:37,760
you know, heavenly sword. Those guys are trying to get their call of duty on and you stop them

536
00:54:37,760 --> 00:54:42,160
from doing that. And we appreciate that minor inconvenience that you almost traded your life for.

537
00:54:43,920 --> 00:54:48,480
Please take this copy of medal of honor. When they pulled it, when they, did you actually see the

538
00:54:48,480 --> 00:54:55,120
gun? Yeah, dog. They pulled out the fuck. I've got a gun. Trust me. Shh. Guess what's in here.

539
00:54:55,120 --> 00:55:00,240
You don't want to know, but it's a gun. When they pull out the gun, what was your response?

540
00:55:00,240 --> 00:55:07,200
My immediate response. Your first impulse. It was very, I mean, the first impulse was,

541
00:55:07,200 --> 00:55:14,880
can I kick over this counter? How high can my kicks get? How high and lethal would this kick

542
00:55:14,880 --> 00:55:21,040
be if I delivered it? And that impulse lasted for maybe a thousandth of a second, which I think is

543
00:55:21,040 --> 00:55:30,880
pretty brave. And then it was, oh God, why did I lie about those space station threes?

544
00:55:31,600 --> 00:55:34,560
I hope they don't go in the back. Help me. Sonic the hedgehog.

545
00:55:38,240 --> 00:55:40,400
Leap into action. Mario cut out. Yeah.

546
00:55:43,040 --> 00:55:46,800
Shit. This has been our comedy podcast, my brother, my brother, and me,

547
00:55:46,800 --> 00:55:51,840
where we take your questions and turn them Alchemy-like into wisdom. Thank you to people

548
00:55:51,840 --> 00:56:00,400
tweeting about the show with the MBMBAM. Hashtag Amoeba. Dave your fave. Deferria. Gunboater.

549
00:56:00,400 --> 00:56:09,600
Gamebeast23456. Sonic Orb Studios. Terrence Fox. Frosty Plum. Red Elephant. Why you no good?

550
00:56:09,600 --> 00:56:17,040
James Letter. Fabled few. I'm AI, damn it. Of course, our friend Brentalfloss. Espypants.

551
00:56:18,160 --> 00:56:23,600
Coymore. Everybody. Me can tweet. Thank you so much for tweeting about the show. If you

552
00:56:24,160 --> 00:56:28,640
want to share our program with somebody, why not tweet a link to our sampler? It's bit.ly forward

553
00:56:28,640 --> 00:56:35,840
slash It's MBMBAM. It's a great way to get other people on board with the program. Best way we

554
00:56:35,840 --> 00:56:41,280
have of growing. Also, if you haven't seen yet, they announced the Max Fun Con East lineup,

555
00:56:41,840 --> 00:56:47,520
and it's pretty amazing. And it includes a lot of great names like John Hodgman and Dick Cavett

556
00:56:47,520 --> 00:56:52,400
and the Stop Podcasting Yourselves guys. But more than that, Michael Ian Black is going to be there.

557
00:56:52,960 --> 00:56:58,720
And how mad are you? I'm so mad. So if you haven't got tickets, I think there are still

558
00:56:58,720 --> 00:57:04,560
some available. So go get them now, maxfuncon.com, and you get all the information there. I want to

559
00:57:04,560 --> 00:57:09,040
thank John Roderick, Long Winter, for the use of our theme song. It's a departure off the album,

560
00:57:09,040 --> 00:57:14,000
Putting the Days to Bed. Thank you, John Roderick. You can pay him back by giving a listen to

561
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:18,000
Roderick on the line. It's his podcast that he does with Marilyn Mann from You Look Nice Today.

562
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:22,320
It's fantastic. If you would like to send us a question about something going on in your life,

563
00:57:22,320 --> 00:57:28,320
you need advice, or you'd like to send us a link to a Yahoo Answers question that strikes you as

564
00:57:28,320 --> 00:57:38,320
funny, email it to mbmbam at maximum fun dot org. Also, listener Ryan Mount emailed us to point out

565
00:57:38,320 --> 00:57:44,480
we talked last week about a roller derby name of Hannah Barbaric. And I was corrected in that

566
00:57:44,480 --> 00:57:49,200
there already is a Hannah Barbaric right here working with the Cincinnati Roller Girls. So I

567
00:57:49,200 --> 00:57:54,000
want to give a shout out to my girls at the Cincinnati Roller Girls. Now when you say your

568
00:57:54,000 --> 00:58:00,320
girls, you mean women that you've never, ever, ever, ever met before. I've actually met a couple

569
00:58:00,320 --> 00:58:03,760
of them. One of them worked at our theater for a while. Okay. And I want to give out to the

570
00:58:03,760 --> 00:58:08,640
Chemical Valley Roller Girls. What up? That's my team. I bet the Cincinnati Roller Girls could

571
00:58:08,640 --> 00:58:14,880
kick your roller girls asses. Well, maybe they'll have a bout and whip it. Figure it out. A throw

572
00:58:14,880 --> 00:58:19,520
down showdown? Throw down showdown. This final Yahoo Answer was sent in by Krista Whalen. Thank

573
00:58:19,520 --> 00:58:27,440
you, Krista. It's by Yahoo Answers user Assman, who asks, in Home Alone, why did the cameraman

574
00:58:27,440 --> 00:58:42,080
just film everything and not call the cops? That's the best. That's the best ever. I'm

575
00:58:42,080 --> 00:58:52,560
Justin McElroy. This has been my brother, my brother and me. Kiss your dad. School wear on

576
00:58:52,560 --> 00:59:01,680
the lips. Keep your heart, three stacks. Keep your heart. Hey, keep your heart, three stacks.

577
00:59:01,680 --> 00:59:12,480
Keep your heart. Man, these girls are smart. Three stacks, these girls are smart. Play your part.
