1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,020
The McElroy brothers are not experts,

2
00:00:04,760 --> 00:00:08,040
and their advice should never be followed.

3
00:00:08,040 --> 00:00:11,320
Travis insists he's a sexpert,

4
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:16,200
but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

5
00:00:17,240 --> 00:00:18,800
Hey, it's my gig, okay?

6
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:23,000
It's all I have.

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,240
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only,

8
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:31,640
so the babies out there will know how cool they are

9
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:33,520
for listening.

10
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:36,720
What's up, you cool baby?

11
00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:41,720
It feels like life, oh, it's better, it's better with you.

12
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:50,880
My life, oh, it's better, it's better with you.

13
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:56,920
This is true, oh, it's better, it's better with you.

14
00:00:56,920 --> 00:00:59,920
My life, oh, it's better with you.

15
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:12,280
Let me tell you something,

16
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:15,120
if you've never experienced that before,

17
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,720
and then you go two years without it,

18
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:20,320
oh, it starts to hurt.

19
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:21,160
Oh, boy.

20
00:01:21,160 --> 00:01:23,320
Oh, boy, it starts to hurt, you start to crave it.

21
00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:25,040
Hello, and welcome, my brother, my brother,

22
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:27,440
me an advice show for the modern era.

23
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:34,320
They did have to recast me during the break,

24
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:39,240
but I'll be playing Justin McElroy, the oldest brother.

25
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:42,240
Sorry, McElroy, it says here, McElroy.

26
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:45,160
I'll be playing Travis, big dog.

27
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:48,000
McElroy.

28
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Oh, no, oh, no, I don't think so, folks.

29
00:01:56,760 --> 00:01:59,560
How many more live shows can we pack into 2021

30
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:01,040
before that dies off?

31
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:04,040
I just checked, is it?

32
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:06,760
None, okay, apparently it's just this one.

33
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:10,280
And I'm Griffin McElroy.

34
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:15,280
And I also want to say a special thanks

35
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:23,160
to the old prospector who came and introduced us

36
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:24,120
at the start of the show.

37
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:25,880
Thank you, old prospector.

38
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:30,880
Yeah, that's funny, I guess.

39
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:34,600
Griff, what's the matter, buddy?

40
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:35,640
What's wrong, bud?

41
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:36,720
You should be happy we're back doing live shows.

42
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:38,080
Yeah, I was back doing shows.

43
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:40,840
Oh, yeah, I'm stoked, I'm stoked, everyone.

44
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:42,840
Did something happen?

45
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:43,680
Yeah, what's up?

46
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:47,280
Hold on, let me try, let me try again.

47
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:49,640
This is sincere, can we get a second read?

48
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:51,640
Yeah, I'll take it, we'll get this in post.

49
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:52,680
Okay, we'll get it clean.

50
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:53,960
Can we get it clean, please, everyone?

51
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:56,640
Hey, what's, what's up?

52
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:00,560
It's fine, let's just do this, we can do it.

53
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:03,080
No, hey, this is a labor, Griffin.

54
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:04,400
Clearly something's up.

55
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:06,760
Do you need to talk in private?

56
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:08,080
Yeah.

57
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:12,280
John Cena whipped your ass?

58
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:15,920
Sorry, oh, I forgot the mics were on.

59
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:17,560
I'm so sorry, Griffin.

60
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:20,600
What, wait, wait, Griffin, is he telling the truth?

61
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:22,480
Or is this some twisted game of telephone?

62
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:23,640
Certainly.

63
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:24,480
No.

64
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:26,720
TV and films John Cena didn't whip your ass?

65
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:29,720
Not children's prank show host John Cena.

66
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:34,200
It's fine, it was this afternoon

67
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:36,520
and I'm doing much better now.

68
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:37,440
What happened?

69
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:39,760
Well.

70
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:44,520
Tell me the true story about John Cena whipped your ass.

71
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:45,520
Up and down.

72
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:48,960
Oh, up and down, you didn't say.

73
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:50,360
Not side to side?

74
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:53,560
No, he got me there too, he got me there too.

75
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:56,600
Poor thing.

76
00:03:56,600 --> 00:04:01,080
It was just like, it really wasn't a big deal,

77
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:04,720
but it was right after lunch and I was going

78
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:06,840
to the restroom.

79
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:09,640
You just finished your Crestless PB&J.

80
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:11,480
Yeah, and it was just after lunch

81
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:14,560
and you know, for the bathroom, that's like rush hour.

82
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:15,680
Yeah.

83
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:17,920
And so I just like showed up to a bathroom

84
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:19,600
and there was only one stall open,

85
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:22,600
but John Cena kind of walked in there at the same time.

86
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:24,440
Yeah.

87
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:28,680
And he was like, excuse me, excuse me.

88
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:32,400
I'm glad you took a second run at that.

89
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:33,240
Excuse me.

90
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:34,760
Much more Cena-esque.

91
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:37,080
No, you guys can joke about this.

92
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:43,720
But I was like, oh hey, great stuff that you do.

93
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:45,040
I'll be real quick.

94
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:50,640
And then he started, like what surprised me

95
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:52,960
was how quickly he started just yelling.

96
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:56,920
He was like, I should go first,

97
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:58,920
I was the one who did wrestling.

98
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:02,720
And then I was like, I understand that,

99
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:03,760
but I'm actually here with,

100
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:07,240
but he already was whipping my ass at that point.

101
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:09,120
Hey, Griffin, I'm sorry.

102
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:11,000
Yeah, no, go ahead and ask.

103
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,200
Whatever you want to know.

104
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:14,840
Did the ass whipping ramp up slowly?

105
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:16,920
No, it was like, it was so,

106
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:21,080
everything about this was so fast.

107
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:25,560
He like, before I knew it,

108
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:29,400
and I was already like, oh yeah, okay, you can.

109
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:32,160
And like a few more stalls opened up,

110
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:35,920
but he was like pretty focused in on that point.

111
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:37,240
Yeah.

112
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:39,000
That's kind of his whole thing.

113
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,640
Yeah, no, he has sort of explosive strength.

114
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:46,800
And then he was like, he was like picking me up

115
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:49,600
and he was like trying to put me in the sink.

116
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:51,120
And he was like,

117
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:52,280
Like head first, like a swirly?

118
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:54,120
No, like he was sitting me in it.

119
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:56,280
And then he was like pushing me down

120
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:59,360
and he was like, I'm gonna make you go in the sink hole.

121
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:00,360
Yeah.

122
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:01,840
And you're sure it was John Cena?

123
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:03,400
It was him, for sure.

124
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:05,800
You weren't mistaking it with another large man?

125
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:10,520
We are never going to be invited

126
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:12,840
to this convention again.

127
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:14,960
100%.

128
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:15,800
We've done three.

129
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:18,520
I know John Cena just stood up in the crowd and walked out.

130
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:19,680
John, it was a joke.

131
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:21,760
We've done three events today.

132
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:24,320
And in every one, the majority of discussion

133
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:26,200
has been about John Cena.

134
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:28,040
It's only been able to talk about all day.

135
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:30,680
Before he whipped my ass inside and out

136
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:32,160
and tried pushing me down the sink.

137
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:33,760
Wait, inside and out is new.

138
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:35,600
And he was yelling.

139
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:36,680
That's a new interaction.

140
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:38,120
That's a new piece of information.

141
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:38,960
Guys, I'm not kidding.

142
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:39,960
You're running like a hand puppet.

143
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:43,160
It was like 10 minutes of him trying to push me down

144
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:44,840
what he kept calling the sink hole.

145
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:46,560
And I was like, do you mean the drain?

146
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:48,560
Was he whipping your ass during that?

147
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:49,400
Was it separate?

148
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:50,840
We're gonna get a letter.

149
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:52,160
We're gonna get a letter from someone.

150
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:53,280
So did he whip your ass

151
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:54,440
and then try to put you in the sink hole?

152
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:57,480
Please ask the McElroy brothers not to talk about me anymore.

153
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:00,160
He should have thought, I mean, it is my fault.

154
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:02,240
I should have let him go first.

155
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:03,080
I guess part of it.

156
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:05,320
Did you try going in the sink hole to defuse it?

157
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:06,560
I didn't, I did.

158
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:07,920
God, it took so long.

159
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:09,600
I started to get uncomfortable for him.

160
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:13,240
And I was like, I'll try to go in the sink hole.

161
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:15,880
How did it end?

162
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:16,880
Where did you leave him?

163
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:19,480
I ran, I mean, I stayed in the sink

164
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:20,920
until he left the room.

165
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:25,680
And then when I was outside, I grabbed a security person.

166
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:30,280
And I was like, hey, and I pointed at him.

167
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:32,280
I pointed at him and I was like, he just,

168
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:34,360
and then he started yelling like again.

169
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:38,320
And he was like, he kept yelling, I'm invisible today.

170
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:42,320
Wait, now hold up.

171
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:43,880
We don't even have time to unpack that.

172
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:45,040
This is an advice show.

173
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:46,560
We do advice here.

174
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:54,200
No, wait, I do have to ask one more question.

175
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:55,960
Did you try to fight back at all?

176
00:07:55,960 --> 00:07:57,960
Did you try to take a swing at him or anything?

177
00:07:57,960 --> 00:08:00,560
I did a couple of times, but then like,

178
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:03,440
I kind of got invested in trying to fit in the sink hole.

179
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:05,560
Would have been a great story.

180
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:07,240
It was collaborative art at that point.

181
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:09,320
And Mario makes it look so easy.

182
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:10,160
I know.

183
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:13,960
So this is an advice show.

184
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:17,280
We take your questions and turn them alchemy-like

185
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:18,120
into wisdom.

186
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:20,360
And I realize now that I should have begun

187
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:22,580
because it's never been more appropriate

188
00:08:22,580 --> 00:08:25,440
by saying we're so happy to be re-emerging

189
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:27,820
with our proud Chilean miners.

190
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:35,640
We return here to the Emerald City,

191
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:40,640
Seatown, Jet City, the Queen City until 1982

192
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:42,440
when they officially changed it to Emerald City.

193
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:43,280
Wait, no, what?

194
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:44,720
The Queen City's Cincinnati.

195
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:45,600
That's right, they changed it.

196
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:46,840
They were scared.

197
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:47,680
Yeah, take that.

198
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:50,480
That Cincinnati was gonna cross the country and-

199
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:51,760
And beat them up.

200
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:55,480
Like John Cena beating up Griffin McElroy.

201
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:57,680
Who, by the way, John's people, if you're listening,

202
00:08:57,680 --> 00:08:59,240
was the one who told that story.

203
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:00,120
Yeah, not us.

204
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:00,960
Not us.

205
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:02,860
It's very easy to confuse our three voices,

206
00:09:02,860 --> 00:09:05,160
but Griffin definitely told the story

207
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:06,160
about how John Cena-

208
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:07,120
I told that story.

209
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:09,160
John wrote it with his actions.

210
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:13,520
I, Justin McElroy, am still extremely hireable

211
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:15,360
for any work that you may have.

212
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:18,360
What the fuck are we hireable for at this point?

213
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:20,400
I mean, they're making another Trolls, so-

214
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:21,960
That is true.

215
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:23,120
That is true.

216
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:27,920
Hey, weirdly, because I'm sure,

217
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:29,920
I just want to give you guys a scoop on this.

218
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:33,220
No one has, let me check with Amanda.

219
00:09:33,220 --> 00:09:34,240
No, okay.

220
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:35,320
They're playing coy.

221
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:36,640
They're playing coy on this one.

222
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:39,760
They haven't reached out yet about that one,

223
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:44,040
but I'm assuming they'll eventually ask us

224
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:44,880
to be in the movie.

225
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:46,560
A much larger part, I have to assume.

226
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:47,400
I have to assume.

227
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:50,500
Yeah, a five-headed tall Troll.

228
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:53,440
That will still not incorporate our dad.

229
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:54,280
No.

230
00:09:54,280 --> 00:09:56,120
I don't know if you guys know this,

231
00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:58,460
but a lot has changed in the last three years.

232
00:09:58,460 --> 00:09:59,640
In these trying times.

233
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:01,880
In these trying times, a lot has changed.

234
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:04,600
I would say that in many ways, I think we've matured.

235
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:07,580
Like a third of the audience just realized

236
00:10:07,580 --> 00:10:08,920
you were setting up a bit.

237
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:11,880
The show has become, I would say, much classier.

238
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:12,720
Oh God.

239
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:14,120
Okay, that one.

240
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:14,960
Much more artistic.

241
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:18,080
Paul, I'm gonna need another White Claw, my man.

242
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:20,080
And so I'd like to start this show off

243
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:23,080
with a little high-class segment.

244
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:25,720
I like to call it Work of Fart.

245
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:26,560
Just say it.

246
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:27,400
Yeah.

247
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:32,760
Kidding aside, thanks, Paul.

248
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:33,600
Thank you, Paul.

249
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:35,440
Should we play?

250
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:36,760
Kidding aside, before we move on,

251
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:38,680
would it be possible for us to listen

252
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:41,320
to the Work of Fart jingle in absolute silence

253
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:42,880
so you guys can appreciate

254
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:45,880
what a fucking low-grade fart sound?

255
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:47,200
Okay, wait, let's all be quiet.

256
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:48,280
Play it again, Paul.

257
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:52,300
["Work of Fart"]

258
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:56,240
Okay.

259
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:59,400
So there are, there's, yeah.

260
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:02,780
Sounds like a fucking key chain.

261
00:11:02,780 --> 00:11:05,360
It sounds like a key chain you press a button on.

262
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:09,000
It sounds like a fucking yak back from like 1994.

263
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:12,620
It was a free use sound effect.

264
00:11:12,620 --> 00:11:13,460
I don't know what to tell you.

265
00:11:13,460 --> 00:11:14,280
We're not gonna spend money on this podcast?

266
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:17,040
We're not gonna spend money on Work of Fart?

267
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:19,120
Are you kidding me?

268
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:22,200
How am I gonna explain that to an accountant of any kind?

269
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:24,360
Now, I see a charge here for $1.79.

270
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:25,200
What is that for?

271
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:26,240
I'm paying for a fart?

272
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:30,720
It had to be a good fart so my brothers liked a bit.

273
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:33,280
No, that part, I think that is actually a federal crime

274
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:35,040
to lie to your accountant, so I don't think.

275
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:36,780
So here's how it works.

276
00:11:37,860 --> 00:11:39,100
I have some-

277
00:11:39,100 --> 00:11:40,360
Now really listen,

278
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:42,740
because the rules are pretty complicated.

279
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:48,620
I have some classics here of different kinds,

280
00:11:48,620 --> 00:11:50,040
and I will list the description

281
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:51,900
and all my brothers have to do

282
00:11:51,900 --> 00:11:54,600
is give me the title of that classic.

283
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:58,040
For example, if I sat a genius detective

284
00:11:58,040 --> 00:12:00,060
who uses deductive reasoning

285
00:12:00,060 --> 00:12:02,660
and is also very confident in his penis.

286
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:04,840
The Sherlock Holmes.

287
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:05,880
Yeah, exactly.

288
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:06,960
Thank you, Griffin.

289
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:10,280
Yeah, I fucking hate how good I am.

290
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:14,240
Justin, I think you're gonna win this one.

291
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:15,080
Okay.

292
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:16,720
You're not, but it's because Griffin,

293
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:18,680
Griffin and I have kind of the same twisted

294
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:20,800
Southwark style sense of humor.

295
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:21,640
Okay.

296
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:25,760
So this first one, I framed kind of like a trailer

297
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:26,840
description while I'm here.

298
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:28,680
Oh, cool.

299
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:30,940
That ought to fix it.

300
00:12:30,940 --> 00:12:35,940
This orphan waif having been tossed aside

301
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:43,280
by numerous people is back and ready for action.

302
00:12:44,260 --> 00:12:49,260
He's angry and he wants more revenge.

303
00:12:50,220 --> 00:12:54,660
This has nothing to do with using the bathroom.

304
00:12:54,660 --> 00:12:58,300
Well, what's the word for angry?

305
00:12:58,300 --> 00:13:00,260
Oh, Oliver Pissed?

306
00:13:00,260 --> 00:13:02,580
That's us. There it is.

307
00:13:02,580 --> 00:13:03,500
Tied.

308
00:13:04,620 --> 00:13:05,820
That's a tie point.

309
00:13:05,820 --> 00:13:06,780
That's a tie point.

310
00:13:06,780 --> 00:13:07,620
Are you ready?

311
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:10,140
Yeah, and don't give us a double hint.

312
00:13:10,140 --> 00:13:11,500
That felt cheap to me.

313
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:12,340
Yeah.

314
00:13:12,340 --> 00:13:15,340
Humphrey Bogart has to help.

315
00:13:15,340 --> 00:13:16,300
Humphrey Beaufort.

316
00:13:16,300 --> 00:13:17,260
Nope.

317
00:13:17,260 --> 00:13:20,340
I said it wouldn't be that.

318
00:13:21,380 --> 00:13:22,740
God, it's like you've never played

319
00:13:22,740 --> 00:13:24,140
a word of fart before.

320
00:13:24,140 --> 00:13:24,980
Okay, I'm ready.

321
00:13:24,980 --> 00:13:25,800
I'm ready.

322
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:28,860
Humphrey Bogart has to help his ex-girlfriend

323
00:13:28,860 --> 00:13:30,820
escape a Moroccan city

324
00:13:30,820 --> 00:13:33,340
if only he can stop masturbating.

325
00:13:33,340 --> 00:13:34,180
Casablanca.

326
00:13:34,180 --> 00:13:35,620
Yes!

327
00:13:35,620 --> 00:13:36,460
Wow.

328
00:13:38,580 --> 00:13:40,460
And Travis, may I say,

329
00:13:40,460 --> 00:13:42,900
just to doff my cap to you, sir,

330
00:13:42,900 --> 00:13:44,540
the easy one was Asablanca

331
00:13:44,540 --> 00:13:46,460
and you didn't walk down that route.

332
00:13:46,460 --> 00:13:47,300
Not as good.

333
00:13:47,300 --> 00:13:48,740
Not as good as Casablanca.

334
00:13:48,740 --> 00:13:50,940
Yeah, that's real good.

335
00:13:50,940 --> 00:13:52,600
Yeah, we can all agree.

336
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:57,600
After being framed for a crime he didn't commit

337
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:03,100
and sent to a terrible French prison,

338
00:14:03,100 --> 00:14:05,960
Edmond Dantes is back,

339
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:08,100
posing as a rich gentleman,

340
00:14:08,100 --> 00:14:11,540
attempting to get his revenge on his enemies

341
00:14:11,540 --> 00:14:12,760
by shoving his hand as far as-

342
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:13,600
Santa Monica Stowe.

343
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:14,440
Yes!

344
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:15,280
Wow.

345
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:22,680
Next!

346
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:24,860
Next one!

347
00:14:24,860 --> 00:14:25,700
What's the score?

348
00:14:25,700 --> 00:14:27,400
It's two-two, right?

349
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:28,240
Well, here's the weird,

350
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:29,320
that was all I had.

351
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:30,160
Damn it.

352
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:31,720
You son of a gun!

353
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:33,200
Come up with another one right now.

354
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:34,760
Come up with another one fresh.

355
00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:36,080
Just fresh, right off the dome.

356
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:36,920
Okay, great.

357
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:43,720
Ariel is dying to join Prince Eric.

358
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:44,800
The Little Spermaid?

359
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:47,160
In a land filled with flatulence,

360
00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:48,920
in this I Want song.

361
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:51,960
Fart of Your World.

362
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:52,800
Yes!

363
00:14:56,040 --> 00:14:59,240
A rare work of fart victory

364
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:00,920
for Justin McElroy.

365
00:15:00,920 --> 00:15:02,460
Wow, this is huge, huge.

366
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:04,960
This is-

367
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:05,800
It's weird.

368
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:07,120
That's weird I like this bit now.

369
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:08,160
That's weird.

370
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:09,600
This is doubly humiliating

371
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:13,960
because I didn't have to say The Little Spermaid.

372
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:16,000
Or Asa Blanca.

373
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:18,440
Yeah.

374
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:23,440
I see your true colors shining through.

375
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:26,440
So as I was saying,

376
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:27,960
this is an advice show.

377
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:32,680
And we're gonna help some people right now.

378
00:15:32,680 --> 00:15:33,840
Here we go.

379
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:37,040
I'm in the middle of creating a delicious bowl of chili.

380
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:40,080
One of its ingredients being a bottle of lager beer.

381
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:43,480
Lager beer.

382
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:44,360
Okay.

383
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:48,720
I've effed up and forgot to get this ingredient.

384
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:50,040
But there's good news.

385
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:52,000
My neighbor is having a birthday celebration

386
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
which he invited me to stop by for.

387
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:59,080
In fact, I already did drop by

388
00:15:59,080 --> 00:16:01,360
to drop off a few baked goods as a birthday gift

389
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:03,480
before returning to my apartment to do chores.

390
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:06,160
One of which was making this chili that brings us to now.

391
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:07,440
Would it be weird for me to-

392
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:08,280
Yep.

393
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:12,600
Would it be weird for me to go and grab a beer

394
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:15,640
from this celebration and then walk back to my apartment?

395
00:16:15,640 --> 00:16:19,000
It seems like it would look like a dick move

396
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:22,440
or at least just weird, but I was invited.

397
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:26,880
I did provide snacks and I wanna make this chili.

398
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:29,960
Which honestly, friend, you should have listed first

399
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:31,640
because that's what's driving you.

400
00:16:31,640 --> 00:16:32,760
What's my move?

401
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:35,520
That's from Chili Maker in Chapel Hill.

402
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:38,720
What I love, I think we need to change

403
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:40,400
the way people ask these questions

404
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:41,640
because I think it should be like,

405
00:16:41,640 --> 00:16:44,520
is this a higher level weird than normal,

406
00:16:44,520 --> 00:16:45,560
weird human behavior?

407
00:16:45,560 --> 00:16:47,160
Yeah, everybody's a baseline weird.

408
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:49,720
Our baseline for that's pretty fucked up, gang.

409
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:53,120
Yeah, because we've all done this, not this thing.

410
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:53,960
Not this thing.

411
00:16:53,960 --> 00:16:54,800
Yeah.

412
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:55,640
No, never, this.

413
00:16:55,640 --> 00:16:57,640
But we've done a thing that you've told the story

414
00:16:57,640 --> 00:16:59,680
like three years later and seen the look

415
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:01,520
on someone else's face and gone,

416
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:03,320
oh, this isn't as charming as I thought.

417
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:04,840
I thought this was kind of roguish.

418
00:17:04,840 --> 00:17:08,120
Okay, I think this may be a helpful way of framing it.

419
00:17:08,120 --> 00:17:10,720
If you throw a party and someone comes

420
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:12,640
and they have a kick-ass time,

421
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:15,400
but then they leave to go do chores,

422
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:16,240
and then they come-

423
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:17,080
Next door.

424
00:17:17,080 --> 00:17:18,960
Next door, and then they come back in

425
00:17:18,960 --> 00:17:23,040
an hour and a half later and they grab a beer

426
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:24,960
and then they leave with the beer

427
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:28,440
as if to say, I got thirsty next door,

428
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:30,640
and then they drink that beer.

429
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:33,240
You would think, pretty inconsiderate friend.

430
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:35,880
Does the same hold true if they walk in

431
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:37,920
and grab a beer and say, don't worry,

432
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:39,400
this is for my chili.

433
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:43,840
Is it the same, is it-

434
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:46,320
What if you say like, I'll be back with some chili soon.

435
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:47,440
That's one thing.

436
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:50,240
You gotta return with some, like a sampling of the chili,

437
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:52,160
but you're not making enough for a party.

438
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:53,000
No way.

439
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,240
So you're gonna have a small solo cup full of chili.

440
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:58,000
This is for the after party of just you and me, Derek.

441
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:02,320
Yeah, a chili fest style sample cup with styrofoam.

442
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:04,280
I actually think it's the one ingredient

443
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:06,160
that it is better if you walked in and said,

444
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:07,120
this is for chili.

445
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:08,560
Cause if you walked in your neighbor's house

446
00:18:08,560 --> 00:18:09,600
and went through their cupboard

447
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:12,040
and grabbed like just a bag of dry beans

448
00:18:12,040 --> 00:18:13,800
or like looked through their refrigerator

449
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:15,840
for a pound of ground beef or something,

450
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:18,680
you said, sorry, just need this for chili real quick.

451
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:21,120
But if you grab a beer and said, I need this for chili,

452
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:24,280
I think there's enough going on that someone will go, okay.

453
00:18:24,280 --> 00:18:25,120
And then only think about-

454
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:26,360
Okay, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

455
00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:28,720
In this circumstance, what you have set up

456
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:30,280
is the situation where somebody's gonna be like,

457
00:18:30,280 --> 00:18:33,240
hey, where are you going with that beer?

458
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:35,760
It's like, well, you know, it's a party.

459
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:37,160
So I'm just getting a beer.

460
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:39,600
Well, no, the nice thing is because you live next door,

461
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:41,440
you can go ahead and crack it open right there.

462
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:45,000
Pretend to drink and make like a glug, glug, glug, glug.

463
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,480
Love that beer flavor.

464
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:48,320
I'm going to hate to waste this.

465
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:50,000
I look so fizzy in my nose.

466
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,320
And hate to waste this on chili.

467
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:53,480
You guys feel me?

468
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:56,160
I'm gonna go drink this next door

469
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:57,680
so I can really savor it.

470
00:18:57,680 --> 00:18:58,920
Savor this.

471
00:18:58,920 --> 00:19:00,720
And if you smell chili later,

472
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:03,440
then I made another drunken oops.

473
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:07,680
I got so tagged off of this Corona.

474
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:09,840
Excuse me, I should have picked any other beer.

475
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:10,680
Yeah.

476
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:15,400
You know what's funny is I actually,

477
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:19,840
in my pantry, I do have about half of a six pack of Corona

478
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:21,640
that I do specifically keep around

479
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:24,080
for chili-based sort of experiences.

480
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:25,840
I can't imagine it's for drinking.

481
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:26,840
No, not anymore.

482
00:19:26,840 --> 00:19:29,360
Not today.

483
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:30,880
That's a tough break, guys.

484
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:34,160
Hey, tough break to my friends over at the Corona Foundation.

485
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:36,320
Does it change it at all?

486
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:38,160
If someone walks into your party, grabs a beer,

487
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:39,680
and says, this is for chili, and leaves,

488
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:41,000
there will still be people at that party

489
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,800
who's like, who's that asshole?

490
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:43,720
But-

491
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:45,320
They're probably already doing that though.

492
00:19:45,320 --> 00:19:47,240
To be fair, people love judging people.

493
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:49,200
Absolutely, but would the same be true

494
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:53,160
if I walked in shirtless with a cape on

495
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:56,040
and grabbed a beer and yelled like, this is for chili?

496
00:19:56,040 --> 00:19:58,000
And then laugh, people would be like,

497
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,920
who the fuck was that guy?

498
00:20:01,160 --> 00:20:04,000
Well, grab that and a lamp yelling this is for chili.

499
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,480
These are both going in, baby.

500
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:07,320
This one's for me.

501
00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:08,440
I'm trying some stuff.

502
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:09,720
It's been a weird year.

503
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:12,080
This one's for chili and this one's for dad.

504
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:13,080
Let's go.

505
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:17,240
Wait, which one was which in that example?

506
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:19,080
I'm gonna eat this fucking lamp.

507
00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:19,920
Woo!

508
00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:25,240
You can just do what I do

509
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:28,720
and just run in, just like, oh no, no, no, no, no, no.

510
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:30,440
And then do it while you're still doing that.

511
00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:32,000
Nobody's gonna stop and question you.

512
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,280
They'll be like, it seemed like an emergency.

513
00:20:34,280 --> 00:20:37,680
Especially if you say like, quick, where's the beer?

514
00:20:37,680 --> 00:20:39,400
I have a beer emergency.

515
00:20:40,560 --> 00:20:41,400
How about another question?

516
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:42,240
Please.

517
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:45,840
My sister is getting her nipples tattooed.

518
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:49,080
You're starting Chicago Bulls.

519
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:54,280
She has many tattoos already.

520
00:20:54,280 --> 00:20:56,160
And I like to be supportive and encouraging

521
00:20:56,160 --> 00:20:57,520
when she gets new ones.

522
00:20:57,520 --> 00:21:00,360
How do I appropriately compliment her new nipple tats

523
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:02,760
without being weird?

524
00:21:02,760 --> 00:21:05,480
I already follow her tattoo artists on Instagram.

525
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:07,520
So I know I'll be seeing at least some

526
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:10,480
slightly censored version of the artwork.

527
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:14,200
It should be a good regular day for you, I bet.

528
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:18,040
That's from Let's Nip It in the Bud.

529
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:20,200
That's fun.

530
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:22,840
Well, I thought, so when I picked this question,

531
00:21:22,840 --> 00:21:27,000
I thought we could do a little scene work

532
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,560
because we are- Oh, good.

533
00:21:28,560 --> 00:21:32,440
We're siblings and we all have tattoos and nipples.

534
00:21:32,440 --> 00:21:35,280
And we're famously good at doing characters.

535
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:38,280
And I thought maybe we could do this like, you know,

536
00:21:38,280 --> 00:21:40,680
and you can pick either one of your brothers

537
00:21:40,680 --> 00:21:43,120
to compliment their nipples if you want to.

538
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:44,200
And like, just pretend-

539
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:46,120
Well, the tattoo that has been recently applied-

540
00:21:46,120 --> 00:21:48,760
I mean, yes, obviously, it goes hand in hand.

541
00:21:48,760 --> 00:21:49,640
Yeah, I guess.

542
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:52,320
It's never happened before in my life.

543
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:53,160
Oh, really?

544
00:21:53,160 --> 00:21:55,280
Because our friend Barbara has a ham tattooed

545
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:56,120
on his nipple where the nipple is-

546
00:21:56,120 --> 00:21:59,920
I've seen his ham nipple and it's exquisite.

547
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:01,680
But I don't think I've ever said word one

548
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:04,960
about the fact that either of you even have nipples.

549
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:06,640
Hey, can I say, I've noticed that?

550
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:08,320
And it's actually weird that you've gone this long

551
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:09,160
without acknowledging them.

552
00:22:09,160 --> 00:22:10,000
It has been.

553
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:13,480
Hey guys, you have four nipples between the two of you.

554
00:22:13,480 --> 00:22:17,640
But we won't say between who, you know what?

555
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:19,880
All right, now, Justin, say something about Griffin's nipples.

556
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:21,960
I'm remaining completely motionless

557
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:24,600
in the hopes that my brothers will forget I am here.

558
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:30,320
Perhaps the podcast will proceed without me

559
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:32,200
and move on to a different segment

560
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:34,440
in which I am more comfortable participating.

561
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:38,000
You guys.

562
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,040
Hoo, guys.

563
00:22:40,040 --> 00:22:44,000
Where to start making jokes about your nipples.

564
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:47,560
That's our job, baby.

565
00:22:47,560 --> 00:22:50,760
Ah, boy, I love these.

566
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:55,160
These guys, if you knew them like I knew them.

567
00:22:55,160 --> 00:22:58,280
Woo, these nipples.

568
00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:04,360
You gotta be proud of that.

569
00:23:04,360 --> 00:23:05,760
What's your favorite part?

570
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:08,920
Oh, don't make him choose.

571
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:12,240
Gosh, where they look.

572
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:19,640
This just really shows that you're a Star Wars fan.

573
00:23:19,640 --> 00:23:23,760
When you go to that length for a nipple tattoo.

574
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:27,640
It's actually a Stewie Griffin in a Darth Vader helmet.

575
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:28,480
Did you catch that?

576
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:30,560
I got that, yeah.

577
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:33,320
How did you integrate the nipple into that exactly?

578
00:23:33,320 --> 00:23:35,400
It's his left and right eyes.

579
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:40,720
That is a big Stewie Griffin.

580
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:41,960
That's a real big.

581
00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:42,920
It's a life-size.

582
00:23:42,920 --> 00:23:44,480
That's why I had to go.

583
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:45,440
Can I be honest?

584
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:47,400
I said originally I just wanted a Darth Vader,

585
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:50,480
but because of sort of the wingspan,

586
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:53,160
it looked a little more sort of.

587
00:23:53,160 --> 00:23:54,520
And a lot of it was just following

588
00:23:54,520 --> 00:23:56,440
the natural contours of his body.

589
00:23:56,440 --> 00:23:57,280
Right, yeah.

590
00:23:58,240 --> 00:23:59,600
And it kind of actually looks

591
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:03,200
like a very tired, dark Stewie Griffin.

592
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:08,920
It was free-handed with a lot of it.

593
00:24:08,920 --> 00:24:10,080
Travis actually did it.

594
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:11,920
I did it, it's so cool.

595
00:24:11,920 --> 00:24:14,040
It was my first one and I really appreciate

596
00:24:14,040 --> 00:24:17,120
the trust you put in me for my first tattoo.

597
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:18,800
It took a long time.

598
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:21,480
Yeah, it looks like it took a long time.

599
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:22,840
It was a labor of love.

600
00:24:22,840 --> 00:24:23,680
It was like that.

601
00:24:23,680 --> 00:24:24,640
I got that vibe.

602
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:25,480
Yeah, for sure.

603
00:24:25,480 --> 00:24:26,880
So what do you think of my handiwork?

604
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:29,880
Why is it still me, do you think?

605
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:30,840
Why am I still the-

606
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:32,400
Why tattooed?

607
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:33,600
Griffin got the tattoo.

608
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:35,040
Yeah, why is it still me?

609
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:37,560
It feels like other people should have a turn.

610
00:24:37,560 --> 00:24:39,440
Everyone is sort of feeling bad for-

611
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:40,880
Hey Griffin, what do you think about

612
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:42,640
what Justin thinks about your nipple tattoo?

613
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:44,680
Hurts my feelings a lot.

614
00:24:44,680 --> 00:24:45,520
Hurts my feelings a lot.

615
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:46,720
Justin, do you want to address that?

616
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:48,240
I think it's important to remember

617
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:49,440
that none of this happened.

618
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:50,360
You remember the part where he thought

619
00:24:50,360 --> 00:24:52,600
it was just Darth Vader and not Stewie Griffin?

620
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:53,720
I did catch that.

621
00:24:53,720 --> 00:24:54,560
We were supposed to have fun.

622
00:24:54,560 --> 00:24:56,440
And then he asked how you integrated it

623
00:24:56,440 --> 00:24:58,280
as if he couldn't see Stewie's eyes.

624
00:24:58,280 --> 00:25:00,160
I was enjoying it at first.

625
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:01,560
The show, not this bit.

626
00:25:01,560 --> 00:25:03,440
It sounds like you really hurt Griffin's feelings.

627
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:04,560
Is there anything you want to say?

628
00:25:04,560 --> 00:25:05,400
Say it to me now.

629
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:08,800
I, you know, people grow.

630
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:11,720
Yeah, I actually heard that was going to be a problem

631
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:14,920
for the tattoo, the dimensions.

632
00:25:14,920 --> 00:25:17,760
People change, one sec, one sec.

633
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:18,680
Let me, let me-

634
00:25:18,680 --> 00:25:19,520
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

635
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:20,360
Think about it.

636
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:23,600
Let me see them again.

637
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:24,440
I-

638
00:25:40,360 --> 00:25:42,560
Great jokes, us from last week.

639
00:25:42,560 --> 00:25:44,000
Hey, Griffin here.

640
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,920
And I'm here to tell you about our sponsors this week.

641
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:48,040
Like for instance, Brooklinen.

642
00:25:48,040 --> 00:25:49,000
I don't know about y'all,

643
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:51,480
but the holidays done snuck up on me this year.

644
00:25:51,480 --> 00:25:53,440
And I'm like, what am I going to gift everyone?

645
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:56,680
You know, a bunch of those sticky slime hands?

646
00:25:56,680 --> 00:25:58,520
No, I did that last year, damn it.

647
00:25:58,520 --> 00:26:00,320
Luckily there's Brooklinen,

648
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:03,440
which has a perfect presence for everyone on your list.

649
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:04,760
Brooklinen started with bedding.

650
00:26:04,760 --> 00:26:05,680
You know this.

651
00:26:05,680 --> 00:26:07,320
But now they offer all the essentials

652
00:26:07,320 --> 00:26:09,880
to make every corner of your home next level comfy.

653
00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:11,480
They got five-star sheets.

654
00:26:11,480 --> 00:26:13,800
They got dreamy decor.

655
00:26:13,800 --> 00:26:15,760
They got cozy loungewear.

656
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:17,560
They got a new line of slippers.

657
00:26:17,560 --> 00:26:19,160
They have freaking candles, man.

658
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:22,400
Everything to turn your house into a cozy little cocoon.

659
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:25,360
That cozy loungewear is nothing to mess with.

660
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:26,280
When I slip mine on,

661
00:26:26,280 --> 00:26:28,920
I feel like a luxurious little gentleman

662
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:33,920
on my way back from the spa that is in my basement.

663
00:26:34,680 --> 00:26:35,760
That didn't make much sense,

664
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:37,800
but give the gift of comfort this holiday season

665
00:26:37,800 --> 00:26:40,400

673
00:26:58,560 --> 00:27:01,720
Squarespace is the platform you use to make a website

674
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:04,240
that will beat every other website's ass

675
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:05,600
right into the ground.

676
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:08,000
They have the tools you need to showcase your work,

677
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,640
sell products and services of all kinds,

678
00:27:09,640 --> 00:27:11,640
promote your physical or online business,

679
00:27:11,640 --> 00:27:14,240
and more, and that's for you to fill in

680
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:16,600
with your filthy mind what that means.

681
00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:18,320
They give you beautiful, customizable templates

682
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:20,040

And of course, I cannot forget about Bombas.

692
00:27:39,620 --> 00:27:40,760
Bombas' mission is simple.

693
00:27:40,760 --> 00:27:42,280
They make the most comfortable clothes ever,

694
00:27:42,280 --> 00:27:45,320
and they match every item sold with an equal item donated.

695
00:27:45,320 --> 00:27:47,600
So this holiday, when you gift Bombas to someone

696
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:50,720
on your list, you're also giving them to someone in need.

697
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:51,920
It's a give-give.

698
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:53,540
Bombas designed their socks, shirts, and underwear

699
00:27:53,540 --> 00:27:55,200
to be the clothes you can't wait to put on every day.

700
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:57,880
Everything's soft and seamless and tagless

701
00:27:57,880 --> 00:28:01,760
and feels good on the body parts that you have.

702
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:04,440
They're made from super soft materials like merino wool,

703
00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:07,240
Pima cotton, and even cashmere,

704
00:28:07,240 --> 00:28:09,360
which makes them the perfect cozy winter layers.

705
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:11,520
And they're also cozy gifts for everyone on your list

706
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:13,180
because they got these festive gift boxes

707
00:28:13,180 --> 00:28:14,840
you don't even need to freaking wrap, man,

708
00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:16,160
because you're already busy enough.

709
00:28:16,160 --> 00:28:17,560
All you gotta do is give them.

710
00:28:17,560 --> 00:28:19,260

716
00:28:31,480 --> 00:28:33,620
coming up December 18th at 9 p.m. Eastern time.

717

00:28:38,120 --> 00:28:39,160
It's lots of fun.

720
00:28:39,160 --> 00:28:42,320
All the podcasts did segments for it.

721
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:44,400
We got lots of friends and family members

722
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:47,000
who did stuff for it and all the sales for that.

723
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:49,240
The tickets are $5 with an option to give more.

724
00:28:49,240 --> 00:28:50,880
Go to Benefit Harmony House,

725
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:52,320
a wonderful organization in Huntington

726
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:54,840
that goes to support people experiencing homelessness.

727
00:28:54,840 --> 00:28:56,840
We also have the Zone of Adventure and Balance series.

728
00:28:56,840 --> 00:28:59,240
That's all up on the YouTube.com slash the McElroy family

729
00:28:59,240 --> 00:29:01,620
and a bunch of new merch over at McElroymerch.com,

730
00:29:01,620 --> 00:29:04,220
including the pin of the month, which is Steely Van,

731
00:29:04,220 --> 00:29:05,200
sales for which benefit

732
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:07,920
the Asian Pacific Environmental Network.

733
00:29:07,920 --> 00:29:09,320
There's a My Brother, My Brother,

734
00:29:09,320 --> 00:29:12,320
and the Man Who Ruined My FYP sticker,

735
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:14,480
referencing Justin's incredible summoning

736
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:16,040
of the berries and cream.

737
00:29:16,040 --> 00:29:18,160
There's a Zone of Adventure enamel pin.

738
00:29:18,160 --> 00:29:20,280
There's so much stuff at McElroymerch.com.

739
00:29:24,040 --> 00:29:25,200
Hey there, beautiful people.

740
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:26,760
I'm Trevelle Anderson.

741
00:29:26,760 --> 00:29:27,880
And I'm Jared Hill.

742
00:29:27,880 --> 00:29:30,200
We are the hosts of Fantai,

743
00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:33,720
the show where we have complex and complicado conversations

744
00:29:33,720 --> 00:29:35,360
about the gray areas in our lives,

745
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:37,960
the things that we really, really love sometimes,

746
00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:41,180
but also have some problematic feelings about.

747
00:29:41,180 --> 00:29:43,640
Yes, we get into it all.

748
00:29:43,640 --> 00:29:45,360
You want to know our thoughts about Nicki Minaj

749
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:46,520
and all her foolishness?

750
00:29:46,520 --> 00:29:47,360
We got you.

751
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:49,400
You want to know our thoughts about gentrification,

752
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:52,080
perhaps some positive question mark,

753
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:53,560
aspects of gentrification?

754
00:29:53,560 --> 00:29:55,300
We get into that too.

755
00:29:55,300 --> 00:29:57,720
Every single Thursday, you can check us out

756
00:29:57,720 --> 00:30:00,080
at MaximumFun.org.

757
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:01,720
Listen, you know you want it, honey,

758
00:30:01,720 --> 00:30:03,480
so come on and get it.

759
00:30:03,480 --> 00:30:08,480
Period.

760
00:30:08,920 --> 00:30:09,760
Here's another question.

761
00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:11,080
Yeah, please.

762
00:30:11,080 --> 00:30:13,040
The kid I tutor broke his hand

763
00:30:13,040 --> 00:30:15,680
and wants me to paint his cast for him.

764
00:30:15,680 --> 00:30:17,840
I'm not super artistically gifted,

765
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:19,920
but I don't want to let him down.

766
00:30:19,920 --> 00:30:21,960
What could I paint on an eighth graders arm

767
00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:23,400
to make him look cool,

768
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:25,760
but not super difficult to do?

769
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:28,680
That's from in way over her head in North Texas.

770
00:30:28,680 --> 00:30:31,920
Why did, why did that kid ask you to paint?

771
00:30:31,920 --> 00:30:34,860
Like why, what, maybe they only know one adult.

772
00:30:34,860 --> 00:30:36,960
That's entirely possible.

773
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:39,280
That's sad, but fair.

774
00:30:41,160 --> 00:30:42,000
Let's see.

775
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:43,320
I mean, this is a great question for us

776
00:30:43,320 --> 00:30:46,880
because we definitely know what people of that generation

777
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:49,000
are super into and think is cool.

778
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:51,640
Eventually they're going to lose interest in Fortnite

779
00:30:51,640 --> 00:30:52,800
and then I'll really be lost.

780
00:30:52,800 --> 00:30:53,840
And that's it, yeah.

781
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:55,360
Wait, oh.

782
00:30:55,360 --> 00:30:59,840
They seem to like pinatas and Minecraft.

783
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:00,760
Yeah.

784
00:31:00,760 --> 00:31:02,600
Oh no, I'm hearing some no's.

785
00:31:02,600 --> 00:31:03,440
Okay.

786
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:06,760
Well, put me in the casket, folks, legends.

787
00:31:06,760 --> 00:31:08,080
I'm done.

788
00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:11,480
Could you, instead of painting something

789
00:31:11,480 --> 00:31:14,680
or doing a picture, do some lettering

790
00:31:14,680 --> 00:31:17,840
to make it look like a Fortnite branded cast?

791
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:18,760
Oh, that's cool.

792
00:31:18,760 --> 00:31:22,560
People like that brand that, is it Massive?

793
00:31:22,560 --> 00:31:23,460
Is that it?

794
00:31:23,460 --> 00:31:24,720
No, shit.

795
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:26,840
Supreme is definitely it.

796
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:30,560
A Supreme cast.

797
00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:32,920
Pretty close though, I think we can all agree.

798
00:31:34,040 --> 00:31:37,900
They practically rhyme, those two very similar words.

799
00:31:39,280 --> 00:31:41,080
Oh, fuck, that was embarrassing.

800
00:31:47,080 --> 00:31:48,200
I want to say something,

801
00:31:48,200 --> 00:31:50,520
but I'm really trying to savor this for a second.

802
00:31:50,520 --> 00:31:51,360
And then-

803
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:52,840
You used to be the young cool one.

804
00:31:52,840 --> 00:31:54,160
Yeah, you were the young cool one.

805
00:31:54,160 --> 00:31:55,000
Yeah, yeah.

806
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:55,880
We need a fourth one now.

807
00:31:55,880 --> 00:31:57,440
We need another one who's young.

808
00:31:57,440 --> 00:32:02,440
Dad, dad, what'd you, well, I mean, drugs.

809
00:32:07,160 --> 00:32:11,720
Just write the word drugs on it real big.

810
00:32:11,720 --> 00:32:14,680
You could write, ask me about drugs.

811
00:32:14,680 --> 00:32:15,880
There you go.

812
00:32:15,880 --> 00:32:16,720
Yeah, I know.

813
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:17,560
But that's a trick question,

814
00:32:17,560 --> 00:32:18,380
because they'll be like, tell me about drugs.

815
00:32:18,380 --> 00:32:19,680
And you'd be like, they're bad.

816
00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:22,060
I have some literature for you.

817
00:32:22,060 --> 00:32:24,200
You fell into my trap, yeah.

818
00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:26,520
I keep them stuffed in my cask.

819
00:32:26,520 --> 00:32:29,560
Sorry I broke your arm, love, John Cena.

820
00:32:29,560 --> 00:32:30,400
That's good.

821
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:32,040
That's really not his style, though.

822
00:32:33,040 --> 00:32:35,120
I don't want to talk about it again.

823
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:38,080
I feel like his lawyers might just now be losing interest.

824
00:32:39,920 --> 00:32:42,040
I mean, maybe you could get, like,

825
00:32:42,040 --> 00:32:44,340
maybe it's like, get it branded.

826
00:32:44,340 --> 00:32:46,640
So it says like, hey, sorry about your arm,

827
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:48,400
but make sure to check out Matrix,

828
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:51,920
Reloaded, coming soon to H.E.O. Maxx.

829
00:32:51,920 --> 00:32:53,520
That's not the name of the film.

830
00:32:53,520 --> 00:32:57,800
Then what have I been waiting for?

831
00:33:01,800 --> 00:33:02,640
Could you-

832
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:04,520
Draw a smaller cast.

833
00:33:04,520 --> 00:33:05,360
All right, okay.

834
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:07,240
0.5% smaller.

835
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:10,280
So it's just kind of fuzzy at the edges.

836
00:33:11,160 --> 00:33:12,280
I saw- That's dumb.

837
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:17,160
Did you guys see what they're doing with the Matrix?

838
00:33:18,680 --> 00:33:19,800
What's the new Matrix?

839
00:33:19,800 --> 00:33:21,000
Resurrections. Thank you.

840
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:22,360
Yeah, you're welcome.

841
00:33:22,360 --> 00:33:26,720
So Paul Sabourin of Paul and Storm fame

842
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:31,720
and I went to go enjoy Ghostbusters Afterlife yesterday.

843
00:33:33,400 --> 00:33:34,920
In a regular theater, Justin?

844
00:33:34,920 --> 00:33:37,160
No, dipshit.

845
00:33:37,160 --> 00:33:40,920
It was a 4DX experience.

846
00:33:40,920 --> 00:33:44,400
Every time Slimer farted, my butt shook.

847
00:33:44,400 --> 00:33:48,520
Now, Justin, I know for a fact-

848
00:33:48,520 --> 00:33:50,360
Don't spoil the movie.

849
00:33:50,360 --> 00:33:51,620
We talked about this.

850
00:33:51,620 --> 00:33:54,000
Yeah, we talked about how we can't spoil the movie.

851
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:57,680
And whether some Slimers may or may not appear in the film-

852
00:33:57,680 --> 00:34:00,440
And maybe you may or may not have lost a bet to Paul

853
00:34:00,440 --> 00:34:01,800
regarding that fact.

854
00:34:01,800 --> 00:34:03,720
I may have bet Paul a sum of money

855
00:34:03,720 --> 00:34:05,640
that Slimer would be in the movie.

856
00:34:05,640 --> 00:34:08,640
Without requiring Paul to match said bet.

857
00:34:08,640 --> 00:34:09,560
Yeah.

858
00:34:09,560 --> 00:34:11,480
So the best case scenario was

859
00:34:11,480 --> 00:34:14,160
you left with the same amount of money you began

860
00:34:14,160 --> 00:34:16,560
and got to see Slimer.

861
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:18,400
Yeah, exactly.

862
00:34:18,400 --> 00:34:20,800
But the beginning of the movie,

863
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:24,560
they have these, they're like commercials for other movies.

864
00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:26,440
And they did one for-

865
00:34:26,440 --> 00:34:28,760
You've seen this, okay.

866
00:34:28,760 --> 00:34:31,840
They had one for Matrix Resurrections.

867
00:34:31,840 --> 00:34:33,640
Erections, yeah.

868
00:34:33,640 --> 00:34:35,000
And before that-

869
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:36,000
You just said erections.

870
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:36,840
Thanks, Trev.

871
00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:41,740
I actually think I said erections,

872
00:34:41,740 --> 00:34:44,200
which is now the only way I'm gonna say that word.

873
00:34:44,200 --> 00:34:46,360
Not that I say it a lot.

874
00:34:46,360 --> 00:34:47,200
Erectos.

875
00:34:47,200 --> 00:34:51,360
That gave me erection.

876
00:34:51,360 --> 00:34:54,240
Hello, hello, what's all this then?

877
00:34:54,240 --> 00:34:56,920
This is one of those erections I've heard about.

878
00:34:56,920 --> 00:34:57,760
There you go.

879
00:34:57,760 --> 00:34:58,920
So-

880
00:34:58,920 --> 00:35:00,080
Apples and pears.

881
00:35:00,080 --> 00:35:02,960
We were watching the commercial for the movie,

882
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:05,560
but before it,

883
00:35:05,560 --> 00:35:08,020
it was, there was an ad that's like,

884
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:11,480
Denny's has entered the matrix.

885
00:35:13,360 --> 00:35:17,040
And it's like, Denny's has glitch meals.

886
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:19,720
Featuring your favorite Matrix characters.

887
00:35:19,720 --> 00:35:23,400
And it's like, I guess Matrix isn't cool anymore.

888
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:25,120
Cause that made me feel pretty old.

889
00:35:25,120 --> 00:35:26,900
Cause I'm kind of excited about our new Matrix,

890
00:35:26,900 --> 00:35:31,200
but if the only brand partner they had on board was Denny's

891
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:33,840
for this new Matrix flick, for their glitch meals.

892
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:37,040
I like that their branding was Uh-Oh Meals.

893
00:35:37,040 --> 00:35:38,240
We made you glitch meals.

894
00:35:38,240 --> 00:35:39,480
There's a glitch in the Matrix.

895
00:35:39,480 --> 00:35:41,840
There's no way we'd give you this much bacon.

896
00:35:43,480 --> 00:35:45,820
Is that pancake a square?

897
00:35:45,820 --> 00:35:48,680
Must be a glitch meal.

898
00:35:49,860 --> 00:35:50,940
And then it's cats.

899
00:35:50,940 --> 00:35:52,980
There's black cats in it.

900
00:35:52,980 --> 00:35:54,780
In the, in the commercial?

901
00:35:54,780 --> 00:35:56,240
Or in the pancakes.

902
00:35:56,240 --> 00:35:57,380
It's in the pancakes.

903
00:35:57,380 --> 00:35:58,800
They're shaped like black cats.

904
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:00,940
And it's like, whoa, I know Kung Fu.

905
00:36:00,940 --> 00:36:03,540
These Matrix jokes aren't landing.

906
00:36:03,540 --> 00:36:04,820
One, not jokes.

907
00:36:04,820 --> 00:36:08,300
Two, I feel like now that it's tied to Denny's,

908
00:36:08,300 --> 00:36:10,540
maybe the shine is kind of off the proverbial apple

909
00:36:10,540 --> 00:36:12,100
a little bit on Matrix.

910
00:36:12,100 --> 00:36:14,140
Maybe Matrix isn't gonna,

911
00:36:14,140 --> 00:36:16,580
against my box office prediction is,

912
00:36:16,580 --> 00:36:20,260
Matrix is not gonna do as well as some people might hope.

913
00:36:20,260 --> 00:36:21,660
Coming soon to HBO Max.

914
00:36:21,660 --> 00:36:22,500
Check it out.

915
00:36:22,500 --> 00:36:24,380
God, this is good shit.

916
00:36:24,380 --> 00:36:25,220
Antlers.

917
00:36:25,220 --> 00:36:27,100
It's like we never missed a day.

918
00:36:27,100 --> 00:36:29,100
Antlers are super cool.

919
00:36:29,100 --> 00:36:30,940
This is a statement of fact.

920
00:36:30,940 --> 00:36:33,500
I would love to start incorporating different antlers

921
00:36:33,500 --> 00:36:35,100
into my outfit rotation.

922
00:36:35,100 --> 00:36:39,420
Problem is, you could guess for a thousand years.

923
00:36:39,420 --> 00:36:40,260
And you would not guess the proper.

924
00:36:40,260 --> 00:36:42,900
You could think the problem is clotheslines.

925
00:36:42,900 --> 00:36:45,100
Problem is leaves blowing in the wind.

926
00:36:45,100 --> 00:36:47,140
Problem is animals need them.

927
00:36:47,140 --> 00:36:49,100
No, problem is I take-

928
00:36:49,100 --> 00:36:50,580
Confused hunters.

929
00:36:50,580 --> 00:36:52,400
Confused city hunters.

930
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:55,460
Problem, there's deer near my house

931
00:36:55,460 --> 00:36:57,660
because I live in West Virginia on a hill.

932
00:36:57,660 --> 00:37:01,700
And every, literally like every West Virginia guy

933
00:37:01,700 --> 00:37:03,780
of a certain inclination and age,

934
00:37:03,780 --> 00:37:05,660
when he sees them, he's like,

935
00:37:05,660 --> 00:37:08,140
man, I'd love to come back up here with my bow.

936
00:37:08,140 --> 00:37:10,260
And I usually have to ask him like,

937
00:37:10,260 --> 00:37:12,780
do you mean to kill deer at my house?

938
00:37:12,780 --> 00:37:14,260
I'd rather you not.

939
00:37:14,260 --> 00:37:15,100
Thank you.

940
00:37:15,100 --> 00:37:17,100
Also, they're not just carrying their bow with them.

941
00:37:17,100 --> 00:37:17,940
Come on.

942
00:37:17,940 --> 00:37:19,140
Come on, it's in the trunk.

943
00:37:19,140 --> 00:37:21,320
Problem is I take public transit.

944
00:37:22,700 --> 00:37:23,620
I told you.

945
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:27,940
Anything I wear is at risk of becoming an invitation

946
00:37:27,940 --> 00:37:31,340
for fellow passengers to strike up a conversation with me.

947
00:37:31,340 --> 00:37:33,020
Some risk higher than others.

948
00:37:33,020 --> 00:37:34,500
Yeah, in this case, I would say

949
00:37:34,500 --> 00:37:36,160
it would be their legal rights.

950
00:37:37,700 --> 00:37:41,560
Even if it's just to say, excuse me, are those antlers?

951
00:37:41,560 --> 00:37:43,740
Is there any way I can wear some dope antlers

952
00:37:43,740 --> 00:37:45,940
that doesn't include strangers

953
00:37:45,940 --> 00:37:48,500
butting into my podcast time?

954
00:37:48,500 --> 00:37:50,820
That's from not as horny as I'd like to be.

955
00:37:53,740 --> 00:37:54,900
I mean, no.

956
00:37:54,900 --> 00:37:56,140
Yeah.

957
00:37:56,140 --> 00:37:57,320
But that's not funny.

958
00:37:59,700 --> 00:38:02,780
If someone says like, hey, what's up with those antlers?

959
00:38:02,780 --> 00:38:03,600
You could just read.

960
00:38:03,600 --> 00:38:04,440
You go, what?

961
00:38:04,440 --> 00:38:05,260
What?

962
00:38:05,260 --> 00:38:06,100
Not again!

963
00:38:06,100 --> 00:38:08,120
Just pull the bus brake cord thing

964
00:38:08,120 --> 00:38:09,420
that I don't know if it does.

965
00:38:09,420 --> 00:38:11,020
It's been a while since I've been on a bus,

966
00:38:11,020 --> 00:38:14,780
but I don't think it brings the bus to a crashing halt.

967
00:38:14,780 --> 00:38:16,100
No, if anything, it just kind of-

968
00:38:16,100 --> 00:38:16,940
No, it is.

969
00:38:16,940 --> 00:38:19,460
Every passenger has the right to stop the bus

970
00:38:19,460 --> 00:38:21,580
wherever they want to.

971
00:38:21,580 --> 00:38:22,700
That would add to the bit though.

972
00:38:22,700 --> 00:38:23,540
If you're like, what?

973
00:38:23,540 --> 00:38:24,460
No!

974
00:38:24,460 --> 00:38:25,800
Why isn't this working?

975
00:38:27,020 --> 00:38:28,080
Not again!

976
00:38:30,540 --> 00:38:33,260
I mean, you could have some small tasteful antlers

977
00:38:33,260 --> 00:38:34,800
that maybe they don't notice.

978
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:36,220
Some fashion antlers.

979
00:38:36,220 --> 00:38:39,340
Well, I just mean perhaps under a hat

980
00:38:39,340 --> 00:38:40,700
and then someone comes on the bus

981
00:38:40,700 --> 00:38:41,900
and you tip your hat to them.

982
00:38:41,900 --> 00:38:43,700
Just for a brief wink of a moment,

983
00:38:43,700 --> 00:38:45,420
they think, excuse me, are those antlers?

984
00:38:45,420 --> 00:38:47,180
No, it must've been my imagination.

985
00:38:47,180 --> 00:38:49,260
And now you've given them a story, my lads.

986
00:38:49,260 --> 00:38:50,100
Yeah.

987
00:38:51,180 --> 00:38:54,440
Oh, you're not gonna believe this story I have for you.

988
00:38:54,440 --> 00:38:56,140
The wildest thing happening today.

989
00:38:56,140 --> 00:38:58,220
I met Mr. Tumnus, I think.

990
00:38:58,220 --> 00:39:03,060
At first I was like, why does that person have

991
00:39:03,060 --> 00:39:06,500
like a wild Dr. Seuss Jamiroquai hat on?

992
00:39:06,500 --> 00:39:07,740
And I was like at first,

993
00:39:07,740 --> 00:39:10,220
like maybe they have antlers under there.

994
00:39:10,220 --> 00:39:12,220
He called himself Mr. Tumbus.

995
00:39:12,220 --> 00:39:15,060
And I thought that was a little on the nose.

996
00:39:16,940 --> 00:39:21,560
I guess like why, if you want to keep it incognito,

997
00:39:21,560 --> 00:39:25,320
there are many accessories that are not antlers

998
00:39:25,320 --> 00:39:26,700
that I would recommend.

999
00:39:27,540 --> 00:39:29,760
Like a flower or a hat.

1000
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:32,640
Those are just two off the top of my head.

1001
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:35,020
I bet I can list as many others given the opportunity.

1002
00:39:35,020 --> 00:39:35,860
Give it a shot.

1003
00:39:35,860 --> 00:39:37,140
Hot shot.

1004
00:39:37,140 --> 00:39:38,300
Regular shirt.

1005
00:39:38,300 --> 00:39:43,020
Okay, I wouldn't call a regular shirt an accessory.

1006
00:39:43,020 --> 00:39:46,020
It's on your ear, it's wrapped around your arm.

1007
00:39:46,020 --> 00:39:48,820
Like a, you know, like a.

1008
00:39:48,820 --> 00:39:51,500
That's not a regular shirt then.

1009
00:39:51,500 --> 00:39:53,580
It's a regular shirt that you've wrapped around your arm

1010
00:39:53,580 --> 00:39:54,580
like Bruce Springsteen.

1011
00:39:54,580 --> 00:39:58,260
No, I would say that that inherently makes it irregular.

1012
00:39:58,260 --> 00:40:01,020
Regular shirt, weird place.

1013
00:40:01,020 --> 00:40:02,900
Name some different places you can put shirts

1014
00:40:02,900 --> 00:40:05,100
where people will be like, I don't think so.

1015
00:40:05,100 --> 00:40:10,100
Could you, when they say, hey, what's up with those antlers?

1016
00:40:11,580 --> 00:40:13,180
You just look up at them and go.

1017
00:40:13,180 --> 00:40:18,180
And I'm going to say after that awesome joke

1018
00:40:23,460 --> 00:40:27,900
that I don't know what sound a deer makes.

1019
00:40:28,940 --> 00:40:32,340
It's also a good way to guarantee no one tries to talk to

1020
00:40:32,340 --> 00:40:33,660
you for the rest of the trip.

1021
00:40:33,660 --> 00:40:38,660
Yeah, unless they're like a secret crypto zoologist.

1022
00:40:40,380 --> 00:40:42,500
They're like, oh shit, actually, all right.

1023
00:40:42,500 --> 00:40:45,100
May I sidle on up next?

1024
00:40:45,100 --> 00:40:48,100
I never thought I'd meet a goat boy here on my own bus.

1025
00:40:48,100 --> 00:40:49,700
Especially one with deer antlers.

1026
00:40:51,220 --> 00:40:52,420
What a bold choice.

1027
00:40:52,420 --> 00:40:55,820
Traditionally goats have what we like to call horns.

1028
00:40:55,820 --> 00:40:56,820
You can wear a shirt that says,

1029
00:40:56,820 --> 00:40:58,420
ask me about my pocket watch.

1030
00:41:00,180 --> 00:41:01,940
And then when they ask you, you be like,

1031
00:41:01,940 --> 00:41:03,020
I don't know, watch.

1032
00:41:03,020 --> 00:41:04,180
What are you talking about?

1033
00:41:04,180 --> 00:41:05,020
What are you talking about?

1034
00:41:05,020 --> 00:41:05,860
They'll be so confused.

1035
00:41:05,860 --> 00:41:06,700
They're like, I was going to ask that guy

1036
00:41:06,700 --> 00:41:08,500
about his antlers, but nevermind.

1037
00:41:08,500 --> 00:41:10,500
He seems like a bit of a pill.

1038
00:41:10,500 --> 00:41:13,820
I'd hate for this to be another pocket watch situation.

1039
00:41:17,020 --> 00:41:20,420
Our show is funny and good and everyone's lucky to be here.

1040
00:41:20,420 --> 00:41:21,620
Okay.

1041
00:41:21,620 --> 00:41:23,580
So weird regular thing.

1042
00:41:23,580 --> 00:41:25,780
So a regular thing you're doing.

1043
00:41:25,780 --> 00:41:28,020
Ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba.

1044
00:41:28,020 --> 00:41:33,020
Folks, it's a haunt.

1045
00:41:37,220 --> 00:41:38,380
This just came across.

1046
00:41:38,380 --> 00:41:40,300
Travis, thank you for seeing that.

1047
00:41:40,300 --> 00:41:41,700
This just came across my desk.

1048
00:41:41,700 --> 00:41:42,980
It's a haunted doll watch.

1049
00:41:45,340 --> 00:41:46,180
Sorry.

1050
00:41:47,940 --> 00:41:50,940
Honestly, guys, I'm as surprised as you are.

1051
00:41:50,940 --> 00:41:53,700
Haunted doll, Khloe Kardashian lookalike.

1052
00:41:53,700 --> 00:41:55,180
Wait, sorry, wait, what?

1053
00:41:55,180 --> 00:41:56,020
What?

1054
00:41:56,020 --> 00:41:57,980
Shh, shh.

1055
00:41:57,980 --> 00:42:01,820
Haunted doll, Khloe Kardashian lookalike, succubus entity,

1056
00:42:01,820 --> 00:42:04,780
sexual spirit, nympho, nymphomania.

1057
00:42:05,860 --> 00:42:06,700
Huh?

1058
00:42:06,700 --> 00:42:08,100
Just what it says on the eBay list.

1059
00:42:08,100 --> 00:42:09,620
And guys, I don't know what to tell you.

1060
00:42:09,620 --> 00:42:12,820
Haunted doll, Khloe Kardashian lookalike, succubus entity,

1061
00:42:12,820 --> 00:42:14,860
sexual spirit, nympho, nymphomania.

1062
00:42:17,020 --> 00:42:19,100
This doll resembles Khloe Kardashian

1063
00:42:19,100 --> 00:42:22,420
and is haunted by the spirit of Khloe, as she calls herself.

1064
00:42:22,420 --> 00:42:23,580
What are the odds?

1065
00:42:23,580 --> 00:42:24,820
How convenient.

1066
00:42:24,820 --> 00:42:28,340
Khloe was a huge fan of reality TV star and spent-

1067
00:42:28,340 --> 00:42:29,820
Huge fun?

1068
00:42:29,820 --> 00:42:32,500
I'm just reading the listing.

1069
00:42:32,500 --> 00:42:35,140
Was a huge fan of reality TV star

1070
00:42:35,140 --> 00:42:39,260
and spent thousands on cosmetic procedures to look like her.

1071
00:42:39,260 --> 00:42:40,260
You heard it.

1072
00:42:41,340 --> 00:42:45,100
Huge fan of reality TV star, period.

1073
00:42:45,100 --> 00:42:46,020
And spent-

1074
00:42:48,380 --> 00:42:52,420
Was the cosmetic work before or after the dollining?

1075
00:42:52,420 --> 00:42:55,740
If I could just read the next sentence-

1076
00:42:55,740 --> 00:42:57,060
That's dumb, Griffin,

1077
00:42:57,060 --> 00:42:59,660
because there's no way it costs thousands of dollars

1078
00:42:59,660 --> 00:43:00,980
to paint a doll.

1079
00:43:00,980 --> 00:43:03,500
I just want to say that she died

1080
00:43:03,500 --> 00:43:06,260
due to complications arising from plastic surgery.

1081
00:43:06,260 --> 00:43:07,100
Yeah.

1082
00:43:07,100 --> 00:43:07,940
Oh.

1083
00:43:09,260 --> 00:43:11,220
But not really, because it's fake.

1084
00:43:11,220 --> 00:43:12,060
Travis.

1085
00:43:12,060 --> 00:43:13,660
Her looks helped her become

1086
00:43:13,660 --> 00:43:16,180
a successful high-end escort in Las Vegas.

1087
00:43:17,580 --> 00:43:20,860
Khloe says it took a long time

1088
00:43:20,860 --> 00:43:22,660
to find the right vessel,

1089
00:43:22,660 --> 00:43:24,100
but she's happy with her choice

1090
00:43:24,100 --> 00:43:27,380
and finally feeling like her true self, a doll.

1091
00:43:27,380 --> 00:43:28,700
I guess.

1092
00:43:28,700 --> 00:43:30,780
She loves to be the center of attention.

1093
00:43:32,300 --> 00:43:34,260
When you give her all of your attention,

1094
00:43:34,260 --> 00:43:36,660
she will shower you with affection.

1095
00:43:36,660 --> 00:43:37,860
Is that good?

1096
00:43:37,860 --> 00:43:40,180
It isn't hard to get along with this spirit.

1097
00:43:40,180 --> 00:43:43,860
All she asks is that you are real with her.

1098
00:43:45,740 --> 00:43:48,500
Hey, Tony, cut the shit, okay?

1099
00:43:48,500 --> 00:43:49,940
Hey, hey.

1100
00:43:49,940 --> 00:43:50,980
It's me.

1101
00:43:50,980 --> 00:43:52,380
It's Khloe, man.

1102
00:43:52,380 --> 00:43:53,740
Be honest.

1103
00:43:53,740 --> 00:43:56,700
Oh, when you get her,

1104
00:43:56,700 --> 00:43:59,500
don't forget to give her a gift of something girly,

1105
00:43:59,500 --> 00:44:01,820
maybe something to do with fashion and beauty.

1106
00:44:03,540 --> 00:44:07,540
Doll is 16 inches tall, comes with a stand, smoke-free.

1107
00:44:08,540 --> 00:44:09,860
Smoke-free?

1108
00:44:09,860 --> 00:44:10,860
Oh, okay.

1109
00:44:10,860 --> 00:44:13,500
The household where the doll came from was smoke-free.

1110
00:44:13,500 --> 00:44:14,820
You're going to.

1111
00:44:16,140 --> 00:44:18,700
As I'm required by eBay's policy on the paranormal

1112
00:44:18,700 --> 00:44:21,100
to indicate that eBay forbids the sale of intangible items

1113
00:44:21,100 --> 00:44:22,660
in this listing is only for a tangible doll

1114
00:44:22,660 --> 00:44:23,500
with no promises for the attached.

1115
00:44:23,500 --> 00:44:24,340
Wait, why?

1116
00:44:24,340 --> 00:44:25,620
Wait, why?

1117
00:44:25,620 --> 00:44:27,780
Why is this shot included?

1118
00:44:27,780 --> 00:44:28,900
Shh, shh.

1119
00:44:28,900 --> 00:44:30,100
So you can see the ass.

1120
00:44:32,100 --> 00:44:33,900
It's for entertainment purposes only.

1121
00:44:33,900 --> 00:44:35,660
But no, wait, friends.

1122
00:44:35,660 --> 00:44:37,060
I don't just have one doll for you.

1123
00:44:37,060 --> 00:44:38,180
I have two dolls for you.

1124
00:44:38,180 --> 00:44:39,380
I have another doll.

1125
00:44:39,380 --> 00:44:40,580
But wait.

1126
00:44:40,580 --> 00:44:42,540
This next doll is named Kim.

1127
00:44:42,540 --> 00:44:43,540
Thank you, Khloe.

1128
00:44:43,540 --> 00:44:45,580
Thank you for your service.

1129
00:44:45,580 --> 00:44:48,140
Oh, fuck no.

1130
00:44:48,140 --> 00:44:49,940
Oh, that, that's B.

1131
00:44:49,940 --> 00:44:51,340
I'm Khloe's friend.

1132
00:44:52,580 --> 00:44:55,500
Haunted doll, spirit vessel, negative entity,

1133
00:44:55,500 --> 00:44:56,740
dark presence.

1134
00:44:57,820 --> 00:44:59,780
I go everywhere Khloe goes.

1135
00:44:59,780 --> 00:45:01,780
I'm Khloe B.

1136
00:45:01,780 --> 00:45:03,220
Do you want a kiss?

1137
00:45:03,220 --> 00:45:05,020
This is, this is B.

1138
00:45:05,020 --> 00:45:06,900
Khloe and I have to be home by 10.

1139
00:45:06,900 --> 00:45:08,420
She can't stay.

1140
00:45:08,420 --> 00:45:09,420
This is B.

1141
00:45:09,420 --> 00:45:10,700
B's vessel is pretty.

1142
00:45:10,700 --> 00:45:14,260
An unusual vintage small bisque doll in good condition.

1143
00:45:14,260 --> 00:45:15,660
Bisque?

1144
00:45:15,660 --> 00:45:16,580
In good, I don't,

1145
00:45:16,580 --> 00:45:18,820
I'm not going to decode the doll stuff, Travis.

1146
00:45:18,820 --> 00:45:20,380
In good condition for its age.

1147
00:45:20,380 --> 00:45:21,980
This doll's full of soup.

1148
00:45:21,980 --> 00:45:26,740
But with some signs of age and where to be expected.

1149
00:45:26,740 --> 00:45:28,740
B is a dark and confused spirit.

1150
00:45:28,740 --> 00:45:31,580
She came to me recently in spirit form only

1151
00:45:31,580 --> 00:45:34,140
and was causing much disruption to my electricity.

1152
00:45:35,460 --> 00:45:36,780
Hence the lighting.

1153
00:45:38,220 --> 00:45:39,460
She's a lost spirit.

1154
00:45:39,460 --> 00:45:41,860
And to help her, I found this vessel for her to take over

1155
00:45:41,860 --> 00:45:43,140
as these do help spirits,

1156
00:45:43,140 --> 00:45:44,940
which cannot pass to the other realm,

1157
00:45:44,940 --> 00:45:46,980
to find some form of comfort or grounding.

1158
00:45:46,980 --> 00:45:47,820
Yeah.

1159
00:45:47,820 --> 00:45:49,340
Why is this the doll you put me in?

1160
00:45:49,340 --> 00:45:51,260
I'm sure that spirit is stoked.

1161
00:45:54,580 --> 00:45:56,500
I said no pictures.

1162
00:45:56,500 --> 00:45:59,940
We have communicated with B via Ouija and dowsing rods.

1163
00:46:01,340 --> 00:46:02,780
She was a farmer's wife.

1164
00:46:02,780 --> 00:46:04,180
You've been doing what?

1165
00:46:05,820 --> 00:46:10,300
She was a farmer's wife and advises that she died of quote,

1166
00:46:10,300 --> 00:46:11,140
poison.

1167
00:46:11,140 --> 00:46:15,140
Travis, can you confirm there is,

1168
00:46:15,140 --> 00:46:17,500
there are quotes on the word poison?

1169
00:46:17,500 --> 00:46:18,740
Correct.

1170
00:46:18,740 --> 00:46:20,860
When she was 43.

1171
00:46:20,860 --> 00:46:22,780
That does sound like the poster is like,

1172
00:46:22,780 --> 00:46:25,100
she's obviously lying.

1173
00:46:25,100 --> 00:46:29,540
Whilst we have not yet got to the bottom

1174
00:46:29,540 --> 00:46:31,580
of how she ingested poison,

1175
00:46:31,580 --> 00:46:34,180
we know her death was very unpleasant.

1176
00:46:34,180 --> 00:46:35,020
Yay.

1177
00:46:36,740 --> 00:46:38,660
Hey, how'd you die B?

1178
00:46:38,660 --> 00:46:39,500
Poison.

1179
00:46:39,500 --> 00:46:40,340
How?

1180
00:46:40,340 --> 00:46:41,180
No.

1181
00:46:42,540 --> 00:46:45,700
She says that she is buried quote, in the field.

1182
00:46:47,340 --> 00:46:49,420
And that she cannot sleep.

1183
00:46:49,420 --> 00:46:51,180
There's much work to be done with B

1184
00:46:51,180 --> 00:46:52,940
and many things to be discovered.

1185
00:46:52,940 --> 00:46:54,300
We'd like to find her new keeper,

1186
00:46:54,300 --> 00:46:55,980
someone who can work with her to find out her story.

1187
00:46:55,980 --> 00:46:58,220
She will disrupt electricity

1188
00:46:58,220 --> 00:47:00,460
by way of interfering with the picture on the TV.

1189
00:47:00,460 --> 00:47:01,820
House spirits love to do this.

1190
00:47:01,820 --> 00:47:03,100
That's a different doll.

1191
00:47:04,020 --> 00:47:07,460
And bulbs may go in usually quickly in succession,

1192
00:47:07,460 --> 00:47:10,380
which we all know if you've been watching.

1193
00:47:10,380 --> 00:47:14,340
She has eyes that will follow you around the room

1194
00:47:14,340 --> 00:47:16,740
and at times her presence can be quite overwhelming

1195
00:47:16,740 --> 00:47:17,780
and chilling.

1196
00:47:17,780 --> 00:47:19,700
Enhance.

1197
00:47:19,700 --> 00:47:23,120
Why do I see a reflection of myself asleep in her eyes?

1198
00:47:24,460 --> 00:47:26,300
Anyway, it says this has all been lies

1199
00:47:26,300 --> 00:47:28,300
and it makes him say it's a lie.

1200
00:47:28,300 --> 00:47:29,900
How much?

1201
00:47:29,900 --> 00:47:31,300
Paul, can you pull up the listing?

1202
00:47:31,300 --> 00:47:33,700
I don't have the, I don't know where it's at right now.

1203
00:47:33,700 --> 00:47:34,740
It's great.

1204
00:47:34,740 --> 00:47:36,340
It just jumped up significantly.

1205
00:47:36,340 --> 00:47:37,900
I would wager in the last five minutes.

1206
00:47:37,900 --> 00:47:39,820
Great, great British pounds.

1207
00:47:39,820 --> 00:47:42,140
Wait, raise your hand if you bit on this dog.

1208
00:47:42,140 --> 00:47:43,980
Oh my God, okay.

1209
00:47:43,980 --> 00:47:44,820
There are a couple.

1210
00:47:44,820 --> 00:47:46,340
Justin posted this listing.

1211
00:47:47,500 --> 00:47:49,340
I should, that would be a good grift.

1212
00:47:49,340 --> 00:47:50,180
Yeah, right?

1213
00:47:50,180 --> 00:47:51,620
I don't know where we're going.

1214
00:47:51,620 --> 00:47:52,700
And then they were arrested

1215
00:47:52,700 --> 00:47:55,580
on the weirdest insider trading charges ever.

1216
00:47:55,580 --> 00:47:57,220
She can be quite rude at times,

1217
00:47:57,220 --> 00:48:00,140
sometimes not talk or communicate at all

1218
00:48:00,140 --> 00:48:01,460
or just swear.

1219
00:48:02,980 --> 00:48:05,580
So she won't talk for you a few days

1220
00:48:05,580 --> 00:48:07,460
and then from your weird doll closet,

1221
00:48:07,460 --> 00:48:12,460
you'll just hear, shit, bastard.

1222
00:48:14,140 --> 00:48:16,900
I'm in the fucking field.

1223
00:48:16,900 --> 00:48:19,060
I'm not going to tell you how I was poisoned.

1224
00:48:19,060 --> 00:48:20,260
Get off my case.

1225
00:48:21,340 --> 00:48:22,940
That's my business.

1226
00:48:25,940 --> 00:48:27,660
Refresh it, refresh it, Justin.

1227
00:48:27,660 --> 00:48:28,500
We have to get it somebody big.

1228
00:48:28,500 --> 00:48:30,100
I can't refresh, I'm not controlling it.

1229
00:48:30,100 --> 00:48:30,940
Yay!

1230
00:48:30,940 --> 00:48:32,260
Yay!

1231
00:48:34,460 --> 00:48:37,100
It's 69, folks, we did it.

1232
00:48:40,860 --> 00:48:43,740
Boy, that was a very great doll.

1233
00:48:45,100 --> 00:48:45,980
Throughout the pandemic,

1234
00:48:45,980 --> 00:48:47,660
I've really been trying to work on my physical fitness.

1235
00:48:47,660 --> 00:48:48,660
I'm also an avid golfer.

1236
00:48:48,660 --> 00:48:52,220
My fiance said she wanted me to take thirst pics

1237
00:48:52,220 --> 00:48:54,260
out on the golf course.

1238
00:48:54,260 --> 00:48:57,500
Fellas, how do I take sexy pictures on a golf course?

1239
00:48:57,500 --> 00:48:59,140
You've come to the right place.

1240
00:48:59,140 --> 00:49:02,100
Put your balls in the hole.

1241
00:49:03,900 --> 00:49:05,100
That, I'm going to,

1242
00:49:07,700 --> 00:49:11,620
there are like four different angles

1243
00:49:11,620 --> 00:49:15,020
on why that was a bad joke.

1244
00:49:15,020 --> 00:49:17,420
Which one will you be exploring first, Griffin?

1245
00:49:20,020 --> 00:49:24,780
Both the metaphor of that image.

1246
00:49:24,780 --> 00:49:25,860
First of all, okay,

1247
00:49:25,860 --> 00:49:30,860
if you put your balls in the cup hole,

1248
00:49:30,980 --> 00:49:34,180
the hole that you try to get the golf ball in,

1249
00:49:34,180 --> 00:49:36,780
it would be hard to see, I think, what you're doing.

1250
00:49:36,780 --> 00:49:39,340
Well, it's a look on your face that sells it.

1251
00:49:39,340 --> 00:49:40,180
They would just be like,

1252
00:49:40,180 --> 00:49:42,460
why is he laying down on the golf course?

1253
00:49:42,460 --> 00:49:43,780
But you would have a look on your face.

1254
00:49:43,780 --> 00:49:45,500
It's like, what, me worry?

1255
00:49:45,500 --> 00:49:46,340
Right.

1256
00:49:47,340 --> 00:49:48,580
I'm a bad little boy.

1257
00:49:48,580 --> 00:49:49,580
I'm a stinker kind of face.

1258
00:49:49,580 --> 00:49:50,780
Yeah, I'm a stinker.

1259
00:49:50,780 --> 00:49:52,060
But I also don't know that-

1260
00:49:52,060 --> 00:49:53,620
That's a thirst trap, right?

1261
00:49:53,620 --> 00:49:54,980
Yeah.

1262
00:49:54,980 --> 00:49:56,980
I also don't know if it's like,

1263
00:49:56,980 --> 00:49:59,380
even if it was very literal,

1264
00:49:59,380 --> 00:50:00,820
especially sexy to say,

1265
00:50:00,820 --> 00:50:03,060
I'm going to put my balls in the hole.

1266
00:50:04,300 --> 00:50:07,260
Oh my, promise?

1267
00:50:11,260 --> 00:50:14,220
You can do the thirst trap and then the sand trap.

1268
00:50:14,220 --> 00:50:15,180
Yeah, that's a good one.

1269
00:50:15,180 --> 00:50:17,740
Those are two words that sound alike.

1270
00:50:18,820 --> 00:50:21,500
So I said, I don't really have a follow up.

1271
00:50:22,660 --> 00:50:24,260
I just wanted to say that.

1272
00:50:24,260 --> 00:50:25,340
Could you lift a golf-

1273
00:50:25,340 --> 00:50:27,460
Can you guys do something?

1274
00:50:27,460 --> 00:50:30,860
Can you lift a golf cart over your fucking head?

1275
00:50:30,860 --> 00:50:31,700
Yeah.

1276
00:50:33,020 --> 00:50:34,380
That's the end of my joke.

1277
00:50:37,020 --> 00:50:38,900
Now I'm still going with balls in the hole.

1278
00:50:38,900 --> 00:50:39,740
All right.

1279
00:50:41,900 --> 00:50:45,100
Could you do a hole in one in a picture?

1280
00:50:47,340 --> 00:50:49,700
Is there such a thing as a thirst gif?

1281
00:50:49,700 --> 00:50:50,540
Yeah.

1282
00:50:53,900 --> 00:50:55,100
Maybe just like a nice,

1283
00:50:55,100 --> 00:50:56,900
like if you're playing at like sunset,

1284
00:50:56,900 --> 00:50:58,740
just a nice picture you smiling.

1285
00:51:00,340 --> 00:51:02,020
Maybe like a knowing smile.

1286
00:51:02,020 --> 00:51:04,220
Hey, I got a story to tell you when I get home.

1287
00:51:04,220 --> 00:51:06,700
I just got my balls out of the hole.

1288
00:51:06,700 --> 00:51:07,540
I want to give credit-

1289
00:51:07,540 --> 00:51:08,380
I want to give credit-

1290
00:51:08,380 --> 00:51:09,500
Where are my balls then?

1291
00:51:09,500 --> 00:51:10,540
I'll never tell.

1292
00:51:10,540 --> 00:51:14,500
I'm being forcibly removed from the golf course.

1293
00:51:14,500 --> 00:51:16,540
Can you guess why?

1294
00:51:16,540 --> 00:51:19,140
That's right, I've done it again.

1295
00:51:19,140 --> 00:51:21,580
We have to move cities.

1296
00:51:25,500 --> 00:51:26,340
I want to give-

1297
00:51:26,340 --> 00:51:28,220
I need you to take me to the emergency room

1298
00:51:28,220 --> 00:51:29,620
because I put the balls in the hole,

1299
00:51:29,620 --> 00:51:31,700
but someone played through.

1300
00:51:34,900 --> 00:51:37,380
I want to give quick credit to this question asker

1301
00:51:37,380 --> 00:51:39,500
because they must have thought for so long

1302
00:51:39,500 --> 00:51:41,860
before landing on throughout the pandemic,

1303
00:51:41,860 --> 00:51:44,540
I've really been trying to work on my physical fitness.

1304
00:51:44,540 --> 00:51:46,220
Do you know how many times there was a little like,

1305
00:51:46,220 --> 00:51:47,540
I'm fucking cut.

1306
00:51:47,540 --> 00:51:52,060
I look fucking good and everybody loves it.

1307
00:51:52,060 --> 00:51:54,580
Look at these fucking abs.

1308
00:51:54,580 --> 00:51:58,500
Fucking sexy and swollen, everybody loves it.

1309
00:51:58,500 --> 00:52:00,100
Help me, sad brothers.

1310
00:52:03,220 --> 00:52:04,860
Help me, doe siblings.

1311
00:52:04,860 --> 00:52:06,340
What can I do?

1312
00:52:06,340 --> 00:52:07,460
They actually wrote here,

1313
00:52:07,460 --> 00:52:09,620
and don't say put your balls in the hole.

1314
00:52:10,540 --> 00:52:12,820
It's like, don't tell us how to do our job.

1315
00:52:12,820 --> 00:52:13,660
Right.

1316
00:52:14,460 --> 00:52:17,100
Maybe you could just like pretend to hump the windmill.

1317
00:52:17,100 --> 00:52:17,940
That's fun.

1318
00:52:17,940 --> 00:52:20,620
Yeah, cause it's definitely a mini golf course.

1319
00:52:22,300 --> 00:52:23,900
Wait, there are other ones?

1320
00:52:24,780 --> 00:52:27,060
Yeah, they make these boring ass golf courses

1321
00:52:27,060 --> 00:52:28,700
where you have to hit the ball wicked hard

1322
00:52:28,700 --> 00:52:29,540
before you get to the fun stuff.

1323
00:52:29,540 --> 00:52:30,380
Major golf courses.

1324
00:52:30,380 --> 00:52:32,020
Major golf, yes.

1325
00:52:32,020 --> 00:52:33,100
Macro golf.

1326
00:52:35,060 --> 00:52:36,300
This is actually very awkward,

1327
00:52:36,300 --> 00:52:38,300
but can I run to the restroom real quick?

1328
00:52:38,300 --> 00:52:39,140
You guys got this?

1329
00:52:39,140 --> 00:52:40,300
Thank you.

1330
00:52:40,300 --> 00:52:42,100
Okay, I mean, there's another question.

1331
00:52:42,100 --> 00:52:44,940
Hey, Paul, could I have another beer?

1332
00:52:44,940 --> 00:52:48,740
Thank you, audience, for confirming that I can.

1333
00:52:48,740 --> 00:52:50,780
Hey, give it up for Paul.

1334
00:52:55,780 --> 00:52:57,460
And Paul, can you check on Justin?

1335
00:52:57,460 --> 00:52:59,220
He's been in the bathroom for a really long time

1336
00:52:59,220 --> 00:53:00,660
and I'm worried about him.

1337
00:53:00,660 --> 00:53:03,460
Can we say a big thanks to the Sheridan Grand Seattle?

1338
00:53:05,460 --> 00:53:08,420
A beautiful hotel that I love.

1339
00:53:08,420 --> 00:53:10,660
I've stayed here for a really long time.

1340
00:53:10,660 --> 00:53:13,260
I've stayed here a few times

1341
00:53:13,260 --> 00:53:15,380
and I hold it so near and dear in my heart

1342
00:53:15,380 --> 00:53:17,180
because it's the only hotel I ever stayed in

1343
00:53:17,180 --> 00:53:20,460
that's fucking across the street from a Cheesecake Factory.

1344
00:53:23,740 --> 00:53:25,220
Also, very exciting.

1345
00:53:25,220 --> 00:53:27,500
Let's give a big cheer for Rachel, our editor.

1346
00:53:27,500 --> 00:53:28,340
Yeah.

1347
00:53:28,340 --> 00:53:31,980
This is the first time that Rachel has been here

1348
00:53:31,980 --> 00:53:33,140
to actually help run the show

1349
00:53:33,140 --> 00:53:34,180
so we don't have to worry about it.

1350
00:53:34,180 --> 00:53:35,220
And it's huge.

1351
00:53:35,220 --> 00:53:36,340
Thank you, Rachel.

1352
00:53:36,340 --> 00:53:38,060
And to Amanda and Danielle

1353
00:53:38,060 --> 00:53:40,380
and to everybody who's helped us do this show this evening.

1354
00:53:40,380 --> 00:53:42,060
And my wife, Rachel.

1355
00:53:42,060 --> 00:53:43,340
And my wife, Teresa.

1356
00:53:43,340 --> 00:53:47,620
And our kids and our dad and Paul Soborin.

1357
00:53:47,620 --> 00:53:49,060
I don't think Justin's ever coming back.

1358
00:53:49,060 --> 00:53:50,740
I think that's entirely possible.

1359
00:54:04,900 --> 00:54:05,740
Oh, God.

1360
00:54:05,740 --> 00:54:07,060
Justin, I mean, Richard.

1361
00:54:07,060 --> 00:54:12,060
Richard, no, Richard.

1362
00:54:17,460 --> 00:54:18,740
Hi, everybody.

1363
00:54:18,740 --> 00:54:20,860
It's a good thing Richard isn't sharing a room

1364
00:54:20,860 --> 00:54:22,780
with anyone this week.

1365
00:54:22,780 --> 00:54:24,660
Yeah, Richard's flying solo.

1366
00:54:24,660 --> 00:54:26,620
Wow, some people smelled it even there

1367
00:54:26,620 --> 00:54:27,940
and they wave it away.

1368
00:54:29,340 --> 00:54:31,300
They wave a smell away.

1369
00:54:31,300 --> 00:54:37,540
It's like a fucking Gallagher show in here.

1370
00:54:37,540 --> 00:54:39,660
Oh, my God, I can taste it.

1371
00:54:39,660 --> 00:54:40,500
Through the mask.

1372
00:54:40,500 --> 00:54:41,860
I'm right next to Richard.

1373
00:54:41,860 --> 00:54:44,460
Hey, guys, it's so cool to be here.

1374
00:54:44,460 --> 00:54:48,860
They're already starting with the jokes, these cut-ups.

1375
00:54:48,860 --> 00:54:50,180
But it's like...

1376
00:54:50,180 --> 00:54:51,820
Hey, Richard, was there a point halfway

1377
00:54:51,820 --> 00:54:53,540
through spraying yourself 19 times

1378
00:54:53,540 --> 00:54:54,860
that you thought, this is too much?

1379
00:54:54,860 --> 00:54:58,820
No, there was a point where I thought, this is not enough.

1380
00:54:58,820 --> 00:55:00,300
I need 20 more sprays,

1381
00:55:00,300 --> 00:55:03,380
but I'm running out of music.

1382
00:55:03,380 --> 00:55:05,580
Yeah, so it's so cool to be here with you guys.

1383
00:55:05,580 --> 00:55:07,620
You made my beard taste like it, Richard.

1384
00:55:07,620 --> 00:55:09,620
I'd like to talk.

1385
00:55:09,620 --> 00:55:11,460
When I heard you guys were doing a live show,

1386
00:55:11,460 --> 00:55:15,140
I was like, yes.

1387
00:55:15,140 --> 00:55:19,180
I got to get there because I love comics.

1388
00:55:19,180 --> 00:55:19,900
Yeah.

1389
00:55:19,900 --> 00:55:21,220
You do?

1390
00:55:21,220 --> 00:55:24,940
Yeah, I'm like a total, total nerd about this stuff, man.

1391
00:55:24,940 --> 00:55:25,460
I love it.

1392
00:55:25,460 --> 00:55:29,380
Who's your favorite superhero?

1393
00:55:29,380 --> 00:55:32,580
Don't make me choose.

1394
00:55:32,580 --> 00:55:33,780
You can say, like, five or six.

1395
00:55:33,780 --> 00:55:35,620
Just anyone, yeah.

1396
00:55:35,620 --> 00:55:39,380
Red...

1397
00:55:39,380 --> 00:55:40,300
Villain?

1398
00:55:40,300 --> 00:55:41,740
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1399
00:55:41,740 --> 00:55:42,940
You guys have him over here?

1400
00:55:42,940 --> 00:55:44,380
Your favorite superhero is Red Villain.

1401
00:55:44,380 --> 00:55:45,540
Red Falcon.

1402
00:55:45,540 --> 00:55:46,060
Falcon.

1403
00:55:46,060 --> 00:55:47,740
I misspoke, yeah.

1404
00:55:47,740 --> 00:55:48,900
Red Falcon.

1405
00:55:48,900 --> 00:55:50,860
I actually don't know if that's the one.

1406
00:55:50,860 --> 00:55:53,540
Okay, these guys know they're geeks and nerds.

1407
00:55:53,540 --> 00:55:55,540
They love it.

1408
00:55:55,540 --> 00:55:57,860
So what I want to do, right, because it's not winter yet,

1409
00:55:57,860 --> 00:55:59,860
normally I'm only allowed to come once a season,

1410
00:55:59,860 --> 00:56:02,820
which is like, I hope you don't like ratings, you know?

1411
00:56:02,820 --> 00:56:04,300
Yeah, man.

1412
00:56:04,300 --> 00:56:08,340
I wanted to talk about, like, some superhero fragrances.

1413
00:56:08,340 --> 00:56:10,740
Because I don't know if you know this, it's, like, not a joke,

1414
00:56:10,740 --> 00:56:13,500
but there's, like, there's a lot of them.

1415
00:56:13,500 --> 00:56:15,460
It's, like, a weird number.

1416
00:56:15,460 --> 00:56:18,900
If you Google later, not now, but these are, like, all real.

1417
00:56:18,900 --> 00:56:19,820
And I love them.

1418
00:56:19,820 --> 00:56:22,380
And they've been really good for me.

1419
00:56:22,380 --> 00:56:24,140
Fucking compliment machines, man.

1420
00:56:24,140 --> 00:56:25,220
Whoa, hey, Richard.

1421
00:56:25,220 --> 00:56:26,140
You get out there.

1422
00:56:26,140 --> 00:56:29,860
You spray them, people are like, yes.

1423
00:56:29,860 --> 00:56:31,180
Here's the first one I got.

1424
00:56:31,180 --> 00:56:32,660
I wanted to try on you guys.

1425
00:56:32,660 --> 00:56:33,500
No.

1426
00:56:33,500 --> 00:56:34,420
Try on us?

1427
00:56:34,420 --> 00:56:37,700
Yeah, it's just, like, yeah, this one is...

1428
00:56:37,700 --> 00:56:39,620
I do like that it came out of a capsule.

1429
00:56:39,620 --> 00:56:40,460
I do actually like that.

1430
00:56:40,460 --> 00:56:41,500
That's cool, right?

1431
00:56:41,500 --> 00:56:43,500
It's like a gamma rays.

1432
00:56:43,500 --> 00:56:44,340
Um...

1433
00:56:44,340 --> 00:56:48,220
You're fucking great, Richard.

1434
00:56:49,460 --> 00:56:53,180
This first one is for, this first one is Spider-Man.

1435
00:56:53,180 --> 00:56:54,700
Sorry?

1436
00:56:54,700 --> 00:56:58,060
This first one is Spider-Man.

1437
00:56:58,060 --> 00:57:02,460
Uh, this is, it says here, the web king is back

1438
00:57:02,460 --> 00:57:04,140
with his great original smell.

1439
00:57:04,140 --> 00:57:05,700
Notes of Vetiver Berry.

1440
00:57:05,700 --> 00:57:06,700
Can I see it?

1441
00:57:06,700 --> 00:57:07,980
The web king?

1442
00:57:07,980 --> 00:57:09,180
The web king is back.

1443
00:57:09,180 --> 00:57:10,940
Can I read where it says that?

1444
00:57:10,940 --> 00:57:13,380
The web king is back with his original smell.

1445
00:57:13,380 --> 00:57:14,460
The nose on this.

1446
00:57:14,460 --> 00:57:15,980
Can I read where it says that, Richard?

1447
00:57:15,980 --> 00:57:17,820
Do you guys know the nose on this one?

1448
00:57:17,820 --> 00:57:19,500
Is it Spider-Web?

1449
00:57:19,500 --> 00:57:20,940
Spider-Web?

1450
00:57:21,820 --> 00:57:23,740
No, it's, the nose, the Korean.

1451
00:57:23,740 --> 00:57:25,900
No, you're thinking of notes.

1452
00:57:25,900 --> 00:57:26,740
Right.

1453
00:57:26,740 --> 00:57:29,100
The nose, like that person who made the smell.

1454
00:57:29,100 --> 00:57:31,460
Oh, it's Andrew Garfield.

1455
00:57:31,460 --> 00:57:33,020
No, correct.

1456
00:57:33,020 --> 00:57:33,860
Wait.

1457
00:57:34,900 --> 00:57:35,980
Mixed message.

1458
00:57:35,980 --> 00:57:36,820
Grib?

1459
00:57:36,820 --> 00:57:37,660
Gribbert?

1460
00:57:40,820 --> 00:57:41,740
Gribbert!

1461
00:57:41,740 --> 00:57:43,260
Yeah, sorry, sorry.

1462
00:57:43,260 --> 00:57:45,420
I was, I just, I love.

1463
00:57:45,420 --> 00:57:46,900
The nose on Spider-Man.

1464
00:57:46,900 --> 00:57:48,300
Everyone knows, they all know it.

1465
00:57:48,300 --> 00:57:49,740
Don't get, don't give it to them.

1466
00:57:49,740 --> 00:57:50,740
Oh, yeah.

1467
00:57:50,740 --> 00:57:52,060
Hugo.

1468
00:57:52,060 --> 00:57:54,180
It's Spider-Man.

1469
00:57:54,180 --> 00:57:56,300
He did the scent himself.

1470
00:57:56,300 --> 00:57:58,580
I do want to take a close look at that.

1471
00:57:58,580 --> 00:58:00,540
Through the mask, he did it.

1472
00:58:00,540 --> 00:58:03,100
It's notes, I'll give, I'll do like one small smell.

1473
00:58:03,100 --> 00:58:03,940
No!

1474
00:58:03,940 --> 00:58:05,100
Because you guys know, all right,

1475
00:58:05,100 --> 00:58:06,540
we're going to pass on that.

1476
00:58:06,540 --> 00:58:09,140
But this one's Spider-Man, it's like notes of vetiver

1477
00:58:09,140 --> 00:58:11,620
and some wood and oak and Spider-Man's the nose

1478
00:58:11,620 --> 00:58:14,900
and he loves it and his wife Mary Jane loves it too.

1479
00:58:14,900 --> 00:58:16,060
They all love it.

1480
00:58:16,060 --> 00:58:17,300
Does it smell like Spider-Man?

1481
00:58:17,300 --> 00:58:18,500
I have to smell it.

1482
00:58:18,500 --> 00:58:19,820
Can I hold it in my hand?

1483
00:58:19,820 --> 00:58:20,820
Yeah, you can just smell it.

1484
00:58:20,820 --> 00:58:22,660
Give me quick, just quick thoughts.

1485
00:58:22,660 --> 00:58:23,740
Give me quick thoughts on that.

1486
00:58:23,740 --> 00:58:26,060
It's just that there's no branding on it.

1487
00:58:26,060 --> 00:58:27,500
Sample bottles.

1488
00:58:27,500 --> 00:58:31,340
Your TSA, if I can say this here,

1489
00:58:31,340 --> 00:58:33,460
I don't know if we're a mixed company,

1490
00:58:33,460 --> 00:58:36,140
your TSA won't even let me bring my seven ounce bottle

1491
00:58:36,140 --> 00:58:38,100
of Spider-Man cologne.

1492
00:58:38,100 --> 00:58:41,300
They take it out, they say, this is too big.

1493
00:58:41,300 --> 00:58:42,580
I say, I'll check it.

1494
00:58:44,300 --> 00:58:46,460
But I think that doesn't even spot back in my pocket.

1495
00:58:46,460 --> 00:58:49,140
They get very like, you know how this does.

1496
00:58:49,140 --> 00:58:51,140
Give it a quick smell.

1497
00:58:51,140 --> 00:58:53,100
No, it's just a Spider-Man cologne.

1498
00:58:53,100 --> 00:58:53,940
That's not bad.

1499
00:58:53,940 --> 00:58:56,940
Yeah, it's like got notes of vetiver and almonds.

1500
00:58:56,940 --> 00:58:58,060
Did you say notes of venom?

1501
00:58:58,060 --> 00:58:59,940
Next up is Superman.

1502
00:59:01,140 --> 00:59:03,460
Clark Kent is back, it says here.

1503
00:59:03,460 --> 00:59:04,300
Clark Kent is back.

1504
00:59:04,300 --> 00:59:05,580
Where was he?

1505
00:59:05,580 --> 00:59:06,900
Clark Kent is back from the dead

1506
00:59:06,900 --> 00:59:10,540
with a new smell that'll wake up the sexual animal in you.

1507
00:59:10,540 --> 00:59:12,140
What?

1508
00:59:12,140 --> 00:59:14,460
Why does it say this?

1509
00:59:14,460 --> 00:59:18,140
Known sexual animal, Clark Kent.

1510
00:59:18,140 --> 00:59:19,820
Clark Kent is back with a new-

1511
00:59:19,820 --> 00:59:23,420
Known boner machine, Clark Kent.

1512
00:59:23,420 --> 00:59:25,140
Do you guys know the nose on this one?

1513
00:59:25,140 --> 00:59:26,300
Is it Clark Kent?

1514
00:59:26,300 --> 00:59:28,460
No, it's Paul Lagartier.

1515
00:59:28,460 --> 00:59:29,660
You guys don't know this?

1516
00:59:29,660 --> 00:59:31,300
Paul Lagartier is the nose on this.

1517
00:59:31,300 --> 00:59:33,860
He put in notes of, let me hit, like-

1518
00:59:33,860 --> 00:59:35,700
Yeah, spray it right up your nose.

1519
00:59:36,980 --> 00:59:38,860
Oh, no!

1520
00:59:38,860 --> 00:59:39,900
No, he didn't!

1521
00:59:39,900 --> 00:59:41,420
Fresh.

1522
00:59:41,420 --> 00:59:43,420
Oh, God, it's bleeding.

1523
00:59:43,420 --> 00:59:47,820
It's like, how you doing over there, Richard?

1524
00:59:47,820 --> 00:59:49,860
It's like, it's challenging.

1525
00:59:49,860 --> 00:59:51,820
It is challenging.

1526
00:59:51,820 --> 00:59:52,660
Right?

1527
00:59:52,660 --> 00:59:53,620
It's like-

1528
00:59:53,620 --> 00:59:55,260
When you do it like that, Richard,

1529
00:59:55,260 --> 00:59:57,620
it's like everyone's wearing Superman cologne.

1530
00:59:57,620 --> 00:59:59,540
Yeah, where it's like-

1531
00:59:59,540 --> 01:00:00,540
It's kind of like-

1532
01:00:00,540 --> 01:00:01,580
How did he go?

1533
01:00:01,580 --> 01:00:03,740
Well, just like he wanted to.

1534
01:00:03,740 --> 01:00:05,860
It's got almond in it.

1535
01:00:06,980 --> 01:00:07,820
You can tell-

1536
01:00:07,820 --> 01:00:09,740
It sounds like melting brain.

1537
01:00:12,540 --> 01:00:14,460
There's some blood.

1538
01:00:14,460 --> 01:00:16,500
I want to move on to Iron Man.

1539
01:00:16,500 --> 01:00:19,860
Wait, just a kind of related question.

1540
01:00:19,860 --> 01:00:22,740
When Superman did get killed by Doomsday,

1541
01:00:22,740 --> 01:00:24,820
I think, in that comic series,

1542
01:00:24,820 --> 01:00:26,700
was there a following comic where people were like,

1543
01:00:26,700 --> 01:00:28,180
where's fucking Clark?

1544
01:00:28,180 --> 01:00:29,500
Has anyone seen Clark lately?

1545
01:00:29,500 --> 01:00:30,340
No, they covered it

1546
01:00:30,340 --> 01:00:32,980
because Supergirl pretended to be Clark Kent.

1547
01:00:32,980 --> 01:00:34,700
Okay, ask and answer.

1548
01:00:34,700 --> 01:00:36,860
Thank you, Travis.

1549
01:00:36,860 --> 01:00:39,060
Can I tell you about Iron Man?

1550
01:00:39,060 --> 01:00:40,380
I'd love to hear about Iron Man.

1551
01:00:40,380 --> 01:00:43,220
This is a robot that everyone's wild about.

1552
01:00:43,220 --> 01:00:46,220
He's a world's-

1553
01:00:46,220 --> 01:00:47,060
It says on here,

1554
01:00:47,060 --> 01:00:50,300
the world's richest robot is back.

1555
01:00:50,300 --> 01:00:52,700
Why is he always back?

1556
01:00:52,700 --> 01:00:55,420
It says the world's richest robot is back.

1557
01:00:55,420 --> 01:00:56,260
Yeah.

1558
01:00:56,260 --> 01:00:57,300
And everyone's favorite,

1559
01:00:57,300 --> 01:01:00,580
the nose on this is also Jean-Paul Leclete-Radier.

1560
01:01:00,580 --> 01:01:01,980
I swear to Christ,

1561
01:01:01,980 --> 01:01:04,220
you put some new syllables in there.

1562
01:01:04,220 --> 01:01:06,300
You put a steak on there, Richard.

1563
01:01:06,300 --> 01:01:07,580
This one is like-

1564
01:01:08,900 --> 01:01:12,060
I mean, like I smell this and I think money.

1565
01:01:12,060 --> 01:01:13,420
I think robots.

1566
01:01:13,420 --> 01:01:14,780
I think rich robots.

1567
01:01:14,780 --> 01:01:16,260
I think Iron Man smells-

1568
01:01:16,260 --> 01:01:17,860
Do you want to take a little whiff, Gribber?

1569
01:01:17,860 --> 01:01:19,580
Do you also, yeah.

1570
01:01:19,580 --> 01:01:21,860
Do you also think it smells like the last cologne

1571
01:01:21,860 --> 01:01:23,020
that you just sprayed up your nose?

1572
01:01:23,020 --> 01:01:24,020
Just get like a little-

1573
01:01:24,020 --> 01:01:25,940
Do you smell the spice though?

1574
01:01:25,940 --> 01:01:28,980
It's like a spicy Iron Man sort of rich robot, right?

1575
01:01:28,980 --> 01:01:30,980
It does kind of smell like motor oil, yeah.

1576
01:01:30,980 --> 01:01:32,580
They love this at my church, man.

1577
01:01:32,580 --> 01:01:34,260
They go crazy for it.

1578
01:01:34,260 --> 01:01:35,900
Oh yeah, how was your walk?

1579
01:01:35,900 --> 01:01:36,740
Stronger than everybody.

1580
01:01:36,740 --> 01:01:39,020
I noticed your necklace there.

1581
01:01:39,020 --> 01:01:40,300
Is that a religious symbol?

1582
01:01:40,300 --> 01:01:41,380
I did it for the geeks.

1583
01:01:41,380 --> 01:01:42,380
Like they love this.

1584
01:01:42,380 --> 01:01:43,980
It's never ending story.

1585
01:01:43,980 --> 01:01:45,500
What does it say on the back?

1586
01:01:46,860 --> 01:01:49,060
Right, this free with purchase.

1587
01:01:52,020 --> 01:01:54,380
Now my man Clint bought this for me on the show floor.

1588
01:01:54,380 --> 01:01:55,220
Thanks, Clint.

1589
01:01:55,220 --> 01:01:57,340
Well, you said like I had to leave my crucifix at home.

1590
01:01:57,340 --> 01:01:59,460
Clint, will you grab me a crucifix?

1591
01:01:59,460 --> 01:02:01,260
And what your man Clint came back with was-

1592
01:02:01,260 --> 01:02:04,540
Was the orange from Little Shop of Monsters.

1593
01:02:04,540 --> 01:02:05,380
What was it?

1594
01:02:06,700 --> 01:02:08,260
Never ending story.

1595
01:02:08,260 --> 01:02:09,820
Did you smell that, Gribber?

1596
01:02:09,820 --> 01:02:11,700
Did you spray it on you?

1597
01:02:11,700 --> 01:02:14,300
Did he, I didn't see him, guys.

1598
01:02:14,300 --> 01:02:15,260
Did he spray it on him?

1599
01:02:15,260 --> 01:02:16,100
Did he love it?

1600
01:02:16,100 --> 01:02:16,940
I did.

1601
01:02:16,940 --> 01:02:17,780
What was his reaction?

1602
01:02:17,780 --> 01:02:18,620
Do the face.

1603
01:02:18,620 --> 01:02:19,460
It was very non-plus.

1604
01:02:19,460 --> 01:02:21,420
Why is everyone wearing a mask?

1605
01:02:22,380 --> 01:02:23,220
What is happening?

1606
01:02:23,220 --> 01:02:25,300
You can't smell any fragrances.

1607
01:02:25,300 --> 01:02:26,380
I'm sorry.

1608
01:02:26,380 --> 01:02:27,660
Richard, sorry, come back.

1609
01:02:29,220 --> 01:02:30,060
What?

1610
01:02:31,940 --> 01:02:32,780
Still?

1611
01:02:35,860 --> 01:02:36,700
What?

1612
01:02:36,700 --> 01:02:37,540
Yes.

1613
01:02:39,060 --> 01:02:40,740
Oh God.

1614
01:02:40,740 --> 01:02:41,940
That's so sad.

1615
01:02:41,940 --> 01:02:44,580
Anyway, there's lots of other great ones.

1616
01:02:44,580 --> 01:02:48,100
I got Black Manta.

1617
01:02:48,100 --> 01:02:48,940
Black Manta?

1618
01:02:48,940 --> 01:02:49,980
They made a Black Manta one?

1619
01:02:49,980 --> 01:02:51,860
Green Lantern.

1620
01:02:51,860 --> 01:02:53,740
But anyway, that's all the fragrances I got.

1621
01:02:53,740 --> 01:02:56,580
I feel like the three of us can just bring it home.

1622
01:02:56,580 --> 01:02:57,420
Let's like wrap it up.

1623
01:02:57,420 --> 01:02:58,260
Yeah, for sure.

1624
01:02:58,260 --> 01:02:59,860
Justin's dead white, man.

1625
01:02:59,860 --> 01:03:01,580
We don't even need him around.

1626
01:03:01,580 --> 01:03:02,980
Yeah, man.

1627
01:03:02,980 --> 01:03:05,180
You did drop one on the floor and if it broke open,

1628
01:03:05,180 --> 01:03:08,060
we would really never be invited back

1629
01:03:08,060 --> 01:03:10,180
to Washington State.

1630
01:03:10,180 --> 01:03:11,020
Wait, I have one.

1631
01:03:11,020 --> 01:03:12,900
No, no, no, I know that this one,

1632
01:03:12,900 --> 01:03:15,060
it wasn't, because you know what superhero this is?

1633
01:03:15,060 --> 01:03:15,900
What?

1634
01:03:15,900 --> 01:03:16,740
Unbreakable.

1635
01:03:17,580 --> 01:03:19,020
Richard, I know you're the guest here,

1636
01:03:19,020 --> 01:03:22,620
but do you want to take a swing at thanking the audience

1637
01:03:22,620 --> 01:03:23,620
and getting us some more?

1638
01:03:23,620 --> 01:03:25,100
Yeah, man, thanks you.

1639
01:03:25,100 --> 01:03:27,220
Thanks ABBA for the great music.

1640
01:03:27,220 --> 01:03:28,180
No, well, Richard.

1641
01:03:28,180 --> 01:03:31,940
Thanks to, I haven't listened for a bit, is it?

1642
01:03:31,940 --> 01:03:33,340
Yeah, no, no, no, I get that.

1643
01:03:33,340 --> 01:03:35,260
No, it's actually Montaigne now.

1644
01:03:35,260 --> 01:03:36,500
Oh, thanks Montaigne.

1645
01:03:36,500 --> 01:03:38,180
This is our first live show with that

1646
01:03:38,180 --> 01:03:40,140
as our righteous theme song.

1647
01:03:40,140 --> 01:03:43,820
Let me think.

1648
01:03:43,820 --> 01:03:46,660
Okay, me and Travis thanked most people

1649
01:03:46,660 --> 01:03:47,740
while Justin was being pretty killed.

1650
01:03:47,740 --> 01:03:49,140
Did we thank our dad?

1651
01:03:49,140 --> 01:03:49,980
Yes.

1652
01:03:49,980 --> 01:03:50,820
Thank you, Clint McElroy.

1653
01:03:50,820 --> 01:03:51,660
Thank you, Clint McElroy.

1654
01:03:54,300 --> 01:03:57,100
Sorry, I heard you goofing on John Cena.

1655
01:03:57,100 --> 01:03:58,140
You want to say anything about him,

1656
01:03:58,140 --> 01:03:59,620
like sorry or anything like that?

1657
01:03:59,620 --> 01:04:01,820
No, not until he says it first.

1658
01:04:01,820 --> 01:04:04,780
Fair, that's cool, yeah.

1659
01:04:06,060 --> 01:04:10,420
Can you, Justin asked me through a mirror

1660
01:04:10,420 --> 01:04:12,420
we use to talk to each other.

1661
01:04:12,420 --> 01:04:14,140
Awesome, fuck yeah.

1662
01:04:15,700 --> 01:04:19,180
We have a mirror we use to talk to each other?

1663
01:04:19,180 --> 01:04:20,500
Definitely.

1664
01:04:20,500 --> 01:04:23,420
Everybody knows this, they all know this.

1665
01:04:23,420 --> 01:04:26,300
I've actually heard, Richard, last time we met,

1666
01:04:26,300 --> 01:04:29,380
you had like a really small knapsack

1667
01:04:29,380 --> 01:04:33,060
that I could hear Justin screaming from.

1668
01:04:33,060 --> 01:04:34,300
Was that that?

1669
01:04:34,300 --> 01:04:38,620
Yeah, it's a huge mirror I keep with a small knapsack

1670
01:04:38,620 --> 01:04:41,180
and it's got Justin, we talk to each other

1671
01:04:41,180 --> 01:04:43,340
and it's just, that's all.

1672
01:04:43,340 --> 01:04:45,180
And then he just told me to ask you,

1673
01:04:45,180 --> 01:04:49,220
he said that you had, he'd sent a whip ass

1674
01:04:49,220 --> 01:04:50,860
final Yahoo for us.

1675
01:04:50,860 --> 01:04:51,700
Oh yeah.

1676
01:04:54,020 --> 01:04:56,780
From the final Yahoo answer, which is weird to me

1677
01:04:56,780 --> 01:04:58,180
because it doesn't work anymore

1678
01:04:58,180 --> 01:04:59,820
when I try to go to the site.

1679
01:04:59,820 --> 01:05:00,660
Yeah.

1680
01:05:00,660 --> 01:05:01,500
It's still in my RS.

1681
01:05:01,500 --> 01:05:02,340
Do you have your login?

1682
01:05:02,340 --> 01:05:03,180
What?

1683
01:05:03,180 --> 01:05:04,860
Have you like updated your password for Yahoo?

1684
01:05:04,860 --> 01:05:06,220
I, no, I do.

1685
01:05:06,220 --> 01:05:07,060
That might be it.

1686
01:05:07,060 --> 01:05:08,260
I do through a VPN.

1687
01:05:08,260 --> 01:05:09,300
Oh, good call.

1688
01:05:09,300 --> 01:05:10,140
Yeah.

1689
01:05:10,140 --> 01:05:11,500
Yeah, I've just actually left the tab open

1690
01:05:11,500 --> 01:05:13,540
for a while now.

1691
01:05:13,540 --> 01:05:17,180
Yeah, I connect through a VPN at Paul Reiser's house.

1692
01:05:18,380 --> 01:05:21,620
Cause I don't want my activity to be monitored.

1693
01:05:21,620 --> 01:05:24,180
So I hack into Paul Reiser's internet

1694
01:05:24,180 --> 01:05:27,300
and then I call my sites through there.

1695
01:05:27,300 --> 01:05:29,380
Wait, so you do it at Paul Reiser's house?

1696
01:05:29,380 --> 01:05:33,100
No, I hack into Paul Reiser's house.

1697
01:05:33,100 --> 01:05:35,460
And let me tell you, he is mad about that.

1698
01:05:40,380 --> 01:05:43,020
Griffin, I'm done with my Paul Reiser story.

1699
01:05:43,020 --> 01:05:44,660
You can finish show.

1700
01:05:46,660 --> 01:05:49,660
Oh, thanks to Jesus Christ, obviously.

1701
01:05:49,660 --> 01:05:53,180
Without his love, none of us would be here.

1702
01:05:53,180 --> 01:05:55,340
Huge big ups to JC.

1703
01:05:55,340 --> 01:05:57,500
My walk with him has never been stronger.

1704
01:05:57,500 --> 01:05:59,380
Please keep me in your heart and prayer.

1705
01:05:59,380 --> 01:06:00,980
Griffin, bring us home.

1706
01:06:00,980 --> 01:06:05,980
This final Yahoo was sent in by R.L. Stein.

1707
01:06:15,220 --> 01:06:18,220
Thank you, Dr. Goosebumps.

1708
01:06:19,780 --> 01:06:22,420
Please, that's just what they call him on the court.

1709
01:06:22,420 --> 01:06:25,540
Thank you, Dr. Goosebumps.

1710
01:06:25,540 --> 01:06:27,540
It's from Yahoo Answers.

1711
01:06:27,540 --> 01:06:30,140
There's nothing I can say that would be as funny

1712
01:06:30,140 --> 01:06:32,340
as anything Richard Stank has done

1713
01:06:32,340 --> 01:06:33,900
since he crossed the threshold of this thing.

1714
01:06:33,900 --> 01:06:36,140
Just being myself, just read the one

1715
01:06:36,140 --> 01:06:36,980
that you have on the screen.

1716
01:06:36,980 --> 01:06:40,220
Sure, this one was, it's a Yahoo Answers user.

1717
01:06:40,220 --> 01:06:59,220
Don Sheena, Don, Don Sheena asks,

1718
01:07:03,220 --> 01:07:04,700
do you think there was a point where a manager

1719
01:07:04,700 --> 01:07:06,820
or someone said, should it be Gina?

1720
01:07:06,820 --> 01:07:08,140
Cause of the jeans.

1721
01:07:08,140 --> 01:07:10,140
Hurry, the people gotta go home.

1722
01:07:10,140 --> 01:07:13,380
Sure, Don Sheena asks.

1723
01:07:13,380 --> 01:07:16,140
My dad's the light guy, he says he wants to go home.

1724
01:07:16,140 --> 01:07:16,980
Whoa.

1725
01:07:18,540 --> 01:07:19,820
Hey, thank you, man.

1726
01:07:19,820 --> 01:07:22,100
Thank you for the ride over here, dad.

1727
01:07:22,100 --> 01:07:22,940
Love you, I'll see you soon.

1728
01:07:22,940 --> 01:07:25,140
Don Sheena, God, we've gone so long.

1729
01:07:25,140 --> 01:07:26,620
Don Sheena asks.

1730
01:07:26,620 --> 01:07:27,460
Yes.

1731
01:07:29,420 --> 01:07:34,420
Don Sheena asks, does, does, fuck.

1732
01:07:35,380 --> 01:07:37,620
Don Sheena asks.

1733
01:07:37,620 --> 01:07:40,260
Just read it.

1734
01:07:40,260 --> 01:07:45,260
Don Sheena, Don, Don Sheena asks, does,

1735
01:07:48,260 --> 01:07:53,260
does, does muscle milk, does muscle milk make,

1736
01:07:54,380 --> 01:07:58,220
does muscle milk make an invisibility potion flavor?

1737
01:08:00,660 --> 01:08:02,980
My name's Richard Stank.

1738
01:08:02,980 --> 01:08:04,220
I'm Travis McElroy.

1739
01:08:04,220 --> 01:08:05,180
I'm Griffin McElroy.

1740
01:08:05,180 --> 01:08:06,420
This has been My Brother, My Brother,

1741
01:08:06,420 --> 01:08:08,940
make it your dad's square on the lips.

1742
01:08:08,940 --> 01:08:10,940
It's better with you.

1743
01:08:13,860 --> 01:08:18,860
My life, it's better, it's better with you.

1744
01:08:19,780 --> 01:08:24,780
My life, it's better, it's better with you.

1745
01:08:25,780 --> 01:08:30,780
Cause it's true, it's better, it's better with you.

1746
01:08:30,780 --> 01:08:35,780
My life, it's better with you.
