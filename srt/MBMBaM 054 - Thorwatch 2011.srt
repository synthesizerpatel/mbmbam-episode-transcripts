1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:30,800
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:48,800
Welcome, my brother, my brother and me, where Travis has suggested we lead off the show by

6
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:54,480
mentioning the release of Thor. That's his high-energy opening. Did you guys see Thor?

7
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:57,600
Hey, did you guys hear about Thor? He's got this hammer thing.

8
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:03,040
He's got a hammer? Did you guys see Thor? Yeah, he's like the prince of Asgard or something.

9
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:08,480
Thorwatch. What's your cinch? Thorwatch 2011, Griffin.

10
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:12,480
The countdown is over. The countdown is over.

11
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:18,800
I saw Thor. There's a Thor signing up my Trader Joe's. He's picking up some soft pretzel bread

12
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:24,160
for Loki. Thorwatch 2011 is an

13
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:28,480
advice show for the modern era. I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy.

14
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:32,720
I'm Travis McElroy. I'm Griffin McElroy.

15
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:36,720
This is not a gag. I said, what should we lead the show off with? And Travis says,

16
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:39,200
Thor came out. All right.

17
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:44,400
What else happened this week that's worth noting? Thor.

18
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:53,920
Yep. So as I mentioned, this is an advice show for the modern era and a Thorwatch

19
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:59,760
simultaneously. We take your questions and turn them into wisdom.

20
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:07,920
And first comes to us from the Carolinas. A few weeks ago, I asked out a female friend,

21
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:12,080
classmate of mine. She said she thought it would be best to just be friends,

22
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:19,120
but we stayed pretty close. We've had a couple of double dates as she called them with a couple

23
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:26,160
we know. I started actively pursuing a relationship with her after she gave me the just friends line,

24
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:33,840
but we still kept up the flirty playful banter. We text each other very often. She sends me messages

25
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:39,360
like, I love you. After I say something particularly considerate or funny. For what

26
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:43,840
it's worth. She's going to prom with a friend of mine who likes her, but she doesn't feel the same

27
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:48,160
way about him. Obviously I'm still attracted to her, but I don't really want to try anything just

28
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:53,520
to get shut down or ruin our friendship flirting. What's her deal? And how should I respond?

29
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:59,280
Confused in Carolina. You should respond by getting as far away from her as possible.

30
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:05,520
Yeah. You should just, we should subtitle this question. Everything bad that one person can do

31
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:11,440
to another person in a relationship. All the evils of the world condensed into one question.

32
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:22,000
With our, let's see, how old are we altogether? We're over 70, right? We're almost 80. With our

33
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:28,800
almost 80 years of experience, we just would like to tell you that you're about to get your heart

34
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:34,720
broken in a way that you cannot even wrap your mind around if you don't take some immediate action.

35
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:39,760
Imagine there's like a giant hammer being swung by Thor at your face.

36
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:43,600
Yeah. That's what's going on right now. You're on top of Mount Olympus.

37
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:51,760
Nope. You're in Asgard and you're about to get a hammer spat in the face swung by this girl.

38
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:55,840
Here's the problem here. You need to guard your ass because you're about to get fucked in it.

39
00:03:55,840 --> 00:04:04,000
That's what we're saying. So your issue is that this girl really, really likes the attention.

40
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:10,000
That's the problem here. You need to get away from her because she's using you.

41
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:18,000
Like a toothpaste tube. I guarantee that if a dude rolled up that she dug on,

42
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:23,680
she would drop you so fast, you would have to pick your face up off the ground.

43
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:28,640
Yeah. Hey, pick up your face. This might be painful to hear,

44
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:35,600
but just imagine if it was like in gym and she was doing it in front of the bleachers and

45
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:38,960
everybody. Like, trust us, it's better now in the privacy of your iPod.

46
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:45,280
It sounds like she's playing a trick on you, much like Loki plays tricks on Thor,

47
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:48,400
because he's the trickster. That's good, Griffin.

48
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:51,360
I've never read it. I don't know what that- You're getting in the Thor-watched

49
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:58,320
I don't know anything about the Thor-averse. But you do know a lot about Thor-a-birch.

50
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:05,280
Yes. I would also suggest that you take a step back and look at what she's doing to your friend

51
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:09,520
that she's going to prom with and realize she's doing the exact same thing to you.

52
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:14,960
What's up? She's like a thermos the way she's playing the hot and cold.

53
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:20,800
You know that scene in Wayne's World where Garth finds the note from the agent that says,

54
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:25,840
exploit feeble public access show. And he says, I'm really glad I'm not that those guys.

55
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:30,320
That's you right now. Like you are, that is the exact guy that you are right now.

56
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:36,720
You're that guy. Get out, cut off all connections. And, and you know what?

57
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:42,240
Here's the, here's the really crazy thing. You ready for this? She'll come after you.

58
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:49,120
This is not a gag. If you have the, the wherewithal, the fortitude to just say,

59
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:54,880
I'm out and run, she is going to be so into you in a heavy, heavy way.

60
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:56,480
And that way lies madness.

61
00:05:56,480 --> 00:06:00,400
Yeah. It's, it's, it's important that you have a lot of willpower,

62
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:02,560
just like Thor's best friend, the Green Lantern.

63
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:19,920
Okay. So in closing, Thor is being shown in 3d and 2d in a theater near you.

64
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:23,840
Get his friend out and really turn in a really nice film here.

65
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:26,800
And I think they're going to enjoy the picture. Next question.

66
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:33,760
How do you turn down a birthday invite when you know the party will be lame?

67
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:37,520
It's not for a few weeks. So an excuse would seem weird.

68
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:39,120
Action now on Twitter.

69
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:45,840
Is he asking how to like how to snipe future plans? Like how to get them from far away?

70
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:52,000
That's a toughie. That's a toughie. You had to have the trick is with this one.

71
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:57,280
You have, you have to snipe them from the outset.

72
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,680
Like if you're going to do a long-term snipe, it's got to be an immediate one

73
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:06,880
because now you've lost the believability of, of doing a long-term snipe

74
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:10,800
because they've already asked you and you should have had the conflict then.

75
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:12,480
And, and first and foremost,

76
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:18,640
start training yourself now to never respond in the absolute positive or absolute negative.

77
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:19,680
For anything?

78
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:22,800
Yeah. Well, when you get asked to make plans that you don't want to do,

79
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:26,640
don't say yes. Don't say no. Say, when is that?

80
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:29,440
Oh, I'm going to have to check. I think that I can't remember.

81
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:31,520
For every single thing, Travis?

82
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:36,240
I mean, it's a good habit to get into if you want to, if you want to be a douche nozzle.

83
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:40,240
People, I've developed that habit. And let me tell you, people just love it.

84
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:44,800
I have that. I have that particular quirk where everything is like,

85
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:46,880
cause I hate to make plans. I hate to have plans.

86
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:50,320
I'll say, yeah, well, we will definitely try to get there.

87
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:54,720
Trying to, trying to hold on to Travis is like trying to hold a handful of water.

88
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:57,600
You can't do it. It'll go right through the cracks of your fingers.

89
00:07:57,600 --> 00:07:59,360
Well, the other option is someone says,

90
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:01,440
do you want to come to my birthday party in three weeks?

91
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:04,000
And you say, yeah. And now-

92
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,800
And then you go to their birthday party and you have a fucking rager.

93
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:10,800
Then we're ignoring the context of the question where he's asking,

94
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:13,440
how do you say no to that without seeming like a dick?

95
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:17,680
Yeah. I think it's a social contract where if you say,

96
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:20,240
oh, I don't know, I'm going to have to check my schedule.

97
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:22,320
That is the nice way of saying no.

98
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:26,640
I'm going to assume that whenever you get a Facebook invite to an event, you say maybe.

99
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:27,920
I do.

100
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:32,320
That's like a construct that somebody built in for your, for your non-committal.

101
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:35,040
The maybe is there so that you don't have to say no.

102
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:38,160
And they know that you're not going to be there.

103
00:08:38,160 --> 00:08:41,680
Like, cause if you say maybe no one's going, that maybe probably means yes.

104
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:46,400
I'm pretty sure Emily Walpost would have some choice words for you right now, Travis.

105
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:48,720
I'm pretty sure you're violating etiquette.

106
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:50,640
But okay, in the exact-

107
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:53,680
We're talking about how he should have, would have, should have, could have.

108
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:56,320
What does he do right now, right this second?

109
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:58,480
Get it off his plate.

110
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:03,040
I would like to suggest A, just go put on a cat in the hat hat,

111
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:05,040
roll some E, just go have a rager.

112
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:08,880
Just roll some E, put on one of those big cat in the hat.

113
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:11,040
How do you turn down a birthday rave?

114
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:12,720
One of those big cat in the hat hats.

115
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:14,960
Put on a Jester hat, you're saying.

116
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:17,360
Right on yourself and some glow in the dark highlighters.

117
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:18,480
Exactly.

118
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:20,400
I don't know the protocol now.

119
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:24,560
Oh, and then it's a self-solving problem because then you'll never get asked to

120
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:26,080
another birthday party again.

121
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:26,560
Yeah.

122
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:30,720
If you show up to your friend's lame ass birthday party and you're fucking colon rolling, like-

123
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:33,840
Like a one man, one man rave.

124
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:37,360
You'll have to suffer through this one, but it'll never happen again.

125
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:38,960
You gotta go.

126
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:41,040
Okay, why?

127
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:46,640
Well, because I think birthday parties are the one party like that people throw where

128
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:50,000
it is a direct affront to your relationship if you don't go.

129
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:53,680
If they're like, I'm throwing a Halloween party and you don't go, then it's like,

130
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:54,320
who cares?

131
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:57,200
But birthday party, it's celebrating them being alive.

132
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:01,520
If you don't go, you're basically saying, I wish you were never born.

133
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:03,040
Yeah, yes, exactly.

134
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:04,480
This isn't worth observing.

135
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:07,280
And try to think about like, when you have a birthday party,

136
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:11,840
the people's birthday parties that you go to, they're gonna feel obliged to go to yours.

137
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:12,160
Oh yeah.

138
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:14,240
So you don't wanna be that lonely little boy.

139
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:15,200
Do you, Alan?

140
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:15,760
Do you?

141
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:17,040
Do you, Alan?

142
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:20,560
Do you, Alan?

143
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:21,060
Griffin.

144
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:22,640
It'll probably be sick.

145
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:24,320
Yeah, it's probably gonna be sick.

146
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:24,820
Griffin.

147
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:26,800
You wanna Yahoo?

148
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:28,800
Yes.

149
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:31,680
Yes, I do.

150
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:32,240
Let's see.

151
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:33,600
Had a lot of new-

152
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:35,760
Well, thank you for still asking after all these years.

153
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:40,080
Had a lot of new contributors this year.

154
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:40,800
I like that.

155
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:43,440
How about this?

156
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:45,200
This one was sent in by Krista Whalen.

157
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:46,320
Thank you, Krista.

158
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:50,000
It's by Yahoo Answers user, Raven Anna Lolita.

159
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:56,240
Who asked, how can I lose weight off of my hands?

160
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:03,040
I need to get to the peanut butter at the bottom of the jar that the knife won't get,

161
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:05,600
but my hands are getting too big.

162
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:08,960
So I need to make them small and I can't cut my fingers off

163
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:10,800
because I need them to scoop up the peanut butter.

164
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:14,640
Is this that question asked by a bear?

165
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:21,840
I just wanna get one more smackerel of honey.

166
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:23,680
Listen, here's the thing.

167
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:26,160
Help, head stuck in the honey jar.

168
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:28,320
Guys, I've got this.

169
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:29,540
Okay.

170
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:31,920
Just cut your fingers off.

171
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:37,360
No, wait, you specifically said in your question

172
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:39,440
that you need those to scoop up the peanut butter.

173
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:42,720
Cut your fingers off and replace it with spoons.

174
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:44,880
This is like a snake eating its own tail

175
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:46,880
because if you were to stop eating the peanut butter,

176
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:49,120
you could probably fit your fat ass hand in there.

177
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:52,720
Oh man, I love that peanut butter.

178
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:55,680
It's my only vice because I know when I eat it,

179
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:57,520
it just goes straight to my hands.

180
00:11:57,520 --> 00:12:01,040
Is this, I'm imagining like a fucking ever long scenario.

181
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:01,540
Yes.

182
00:12:01,540 --> 00:12:02,400
Putting out here.

183
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:05,680
A moment on the lips, forever on the fingertips.

184
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:06,560
There it is.

185
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:11,760
Peanut butter's good.

186
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:14,880
Yahoo Answers user Asher responded,

187
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:17,040
break or dislocate your thumb.

188
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:18,560
Then your hand will slide right in

189
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:20,320
and you can still use your other fingers

190
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:21,920
to scoop out the peanut butter.

191
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:23,600
Why not just cut open the jar?

192
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:25,700
Yeah.

193
00:12:25,700 --> 00:12:27,040
Listen, if you're gonna do that,

194
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:28,400
listen, if she had a knife,

195
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:30,240
listen, if she had access to a knife,

196
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:31,680
she wouldn't need to put her whole mitt

197
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:33,280
in the peanut butter jar.

198
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:34,640
God knows she's not allowed

199
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:36,400
to have sharp objects on the ward.

200
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:38,240
I'm actually, I think that we could make

201
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:42,000
a pretty compelling sequel to 127 Hours here.

202
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:45,840
Or instead of it being Aaron Rolston

203
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:48,720
getting trapped under a rock in a canyon

204
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:50,240
and having to cut his own arm off.

205
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:52,640
It's a really dumb person.

206
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:55,200
That's like soups hungry for peanut butter.

207
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:58,240
And halfway through she'd masturbate

208
00:12:58,240 --> 00:12:59,520
to a picture of pizza she took

209
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:00,480
on her digital camera.

210
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:02,720
Here's what I love.

211
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:04,720
Her complaint is that her knife

212
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:06,880
can't get to the peanut butter

213
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:08,880
and she wants to slim her hand down.

214
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:09,120
Yeah.

215
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:11,760
Just smaller than a knife?

216
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:12,720
Is that what she's saying?

217
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:15,840
She wants Edward Scissorhands.

218
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:19,520
Ah, that old chestnut.

219
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:21,360
Edward peanut butter taste.

220
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:23,040
Listen, sometimes tools,

221
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:25,200
simple rudimentary tools,

222
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:26,480
aren't enough to get the job done.

223
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:29,520
Your finger is the most elegant tool

224
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:30,560
that God ever made.

225
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:33,120
The finger is the most elegant

226
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:35,760
peanut butter scooping tool.

227
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:38,240
It's a great intersection of flexibility.

228
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:39,360
Haven't you seen the videos

229
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:41,520
of the chimpanzee trying to get the thing,

230
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:44,000
like the honey out of the beaker,

231
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,760
and then a little kid tries to do it

232
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:46,800
and the little kid can't do it

233
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:48,240
because he's so fucking stupid,

234
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:50,880
but the chimpanzee just dips his finger in there

235
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:53,760
and it's like, mm, syrup.

236
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:56,400
Can I show yours a little kid like that?

237
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:58,080
Like he eats the little kid's honey too?

238
00:13:58,800 --> 00:13:59,920
Yeah, he goes to the little kid

239
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:01,280
and he's like, give me that, you dumb fuck.

240
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,760
Come here, you got some nits in your hair

241
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:06,960
that I'm gonna eat.

242
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:08,880
I'm protecting you now like my child.

243
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:11,040
Your fingers are made,

244
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:12,960
these fingers are made for scooping

245
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:14,080
and that's just what they'll do.

246
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:19,760
I would love to see this person's keyboard

247
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:20,960
that they type this question down.

248
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:23,280
Pretty sticky, right?

249
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:25,920
We would have to agree, pretty overall, pretty sticky.

250
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:30,320
We'd say it's stickiness rating is 10 out of 10.

251
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:32,960
The P and B keys are like worn down demands

252
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:38,240
for all the PB forums.

253
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:41,440
I'd like to see the roof of her mouth.

254
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:43,520
What's going on up there?

255
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:45,520
Oh boy, can you do any tongue twisters?

256
00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:47,600
I cannot, not since the mid-70s.

257
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:49,840
Ancient reservoirs of sweet peanut butter.

258
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:53,920
There's kinds that they don't even make up there.

259
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:55,920
There's Peter Pan up there.

260
00:14:58,400 --> 00:15:00,800
So in closing, kill yourself, I guess.

261
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:05,200
I don't know, I don't have a good answer for this person.

262
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:07,360
They've set themselves up with a logistical conundrum.

263
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:10,320
You gotta pick your favorite PB scooping thing.

264
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:12,240
Pick your favorite.

265
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:15,120
Thank you, I think they understood

266
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:17,760
what I meant when I said PB scooping thing.

267
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:20,080
All right, no, like you've bought into the reality

268
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:21,840
that this person has absorbed you into.

269
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:22,320
You pick?

270
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:24,960
The best PB scooping thing is like a spoon or something.

271
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:27,120
Choose your favorite thing, cut all the others off.

272
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:28,720
You only need that one.

273
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:31,680
That would actually streamline the hand enough

274
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:33,520
that they can get whatever their favorite,

275
00:15:33,520 --> 00:15:34,640
I don't wanna bias them,

276
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:37,680
but they could get their favorite

277
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:40,960
peanut butter scooping finger, slice the rest off,

278
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:45,040
and just make like the perfect PB tool.

279
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:47,360
Like a hand probiscus, like, yeah.

280
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:51,920
Could they get another mouth on their finger?

281
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:52,720
Is that possible?

282
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:56,240
Hey, science, can you do this for us?

283
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:57,040
It's science?

284
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:59,840
I'm tired of lifting it all the way to my mouth.

285
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:01,920
If I could just put my probiscus.

286
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:03,680
I need to cut out the middle man

287
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:05,600
and just turn my middle finger into a probiscus,

288
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:09,120
which I can use to sop up all the sweet PB.

289
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:10,800
I'm not sad.

290
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:11,440
This question is gonna be sad.

291
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:13,520
I've been sad for about two and a half minutes.

292
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:14,160
I'm hungry.

293
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:18,160
I'm headed to my friend's bachelor party

294
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:23,680
for a weekend of food, fun, five beverages, and frivolity.

295
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:26,720
I plan on driving out with a friend of mine

296
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:30,240
who lives in town since the party is two hours away.

297
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:32,160
The only problem is that the party starts

298
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:33,440
pretty early in the morning.

299
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:34,880
We're playing mini golf at nine.

300
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:37,680
And now the friend I'm driving with

301
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:40,560
refuses to wake up early enough to get us there on time.

302
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:42,320
I would really like to be there for the whole party

303
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:44,000
since the groom is a good friend of mine

304
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,280
and I'm sure it will be a good time.

305
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:47,200
With rising gas prices,

306
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:49,040
it would be an expensive weekend to drive alone.

307
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:52,000
How can I make it to the party on time,

308
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,520
worrisome in Wisconsin?

309
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:57,520
Finally, some advice that everyone can apply to their lives.

310
00:16:57,520 --> 00:17:00,720
How do I make it to the bachelor mini golf

311
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:03,600
by myself early enough in the morning?

312
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:07,280
Tell your friend that you will make a little bed for him,

313
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:10,720
a little nap zone right there in the passenger seat.

314
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:12,560
And then you go up to his room.

315
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:14,480
He has to give you his house keys.

316
00:17:15,040 --> 00:17:18,960
You go up to his room, you open the door,

317
00:17:18,960 --> 00:17:25,920
you lovingly, like a parent whose child has fallen asleep

318
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:27,360
watching their favorite Disney film.

319
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:30,720
Look at his face.

320
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:33,120
He's tuckered, plump tuckered.

321
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:34,560
You've known each other for years.

322
00:17:34,560 --> 00:17:36,880
Just scoop him up and hold him close.

323
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:37,840
Make sure he's big.

324
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:40,960
Get his banky, get his winky, get his boinky.

325
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:44,560
Pick all four of them up, himself included,

326
00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:45,600
and carry him down.

327
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:49,680
Oh, oh, oh, oh, careful.

328
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:51,360
There's a roller skate on the step stone.

329
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:52,960
Oh good, you missed it.

330
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:55,520
And then just lay him down in the passenger seat

331
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:56,480
and stroke his hair.

332
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:00,800
Maybe turn on some soothing music.

333
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:04,240
Maybe some raffy, some Sharon Loveson Bram.

334
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:06,960
I know you've got some Norah Jones in that CD box.

335
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:13,040
Don't know why you're driving to mini golf this early.

336
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:14,160
Something like that.

337
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:16,400
Put that on and just let him sleep the whole trip.

338
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:17,760
Done.

339
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:18,960
He doesn't even have to wake up.

340
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:23,840
He'll wake up and oh, what a good mini golf.

341
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:24,800
Like what could be better?

342
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:28,400
I want to throw out one change to that.

343
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:28,960
Okay.

344
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:30,160
Don't tell him beforehand.

345
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:32,320
Where am I?

346
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:35,760
And maybe don't take him to mini golf.

347
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:38,560
Take him somewhere else and let him find his way to mini golf.

348
00:18:38,560 --> 00:18:40,720
But also steal his wallet and cell phone and keys.

349
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:45,200
Okay, so you're creating more of a hitcher scenario

350
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:48,480
where it's like a life or death test.

351
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:50,800
And just leave a note pinned to a shirt that says

352
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:53,840
waking up early doesn't seem like such a bad idea anymore, does it?

353
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:54,960
Good luck.

354
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:56,560
Call if you die.

355
00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:00,800
I think just let him sleep and you can take him

356
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:02,240
and everything will be fine.

357
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:04,400
And then when you wake up, just make him pay for gas.

358
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:05,680
Tell him he can sleep the whole time.

359
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:08,400
I do have to say, though, whoever this bachelor is or-

360
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:10,400
He's the worst fucking worst fucking guy on the planet.

361
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:11,680
What the fuck?

362
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:14,160
Who makes people wake up that early?

363
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:16,480
I know I'm already like super inconveniencing you

364
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:17,760
by making you come to my wedding.

365
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:21,680
But also you're going to drive two hours to come play fucking mini golf.

366
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:24,000
Like sorry about it being so early.

367
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,080
It was the best tea time I could get.

368
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:26,960
Yeah.

369
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:31,360
Do you know before my friend Tommy Red's wedding, the day of,

370
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:33,120
he did a traditional bachelor party.

371
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:36,160
And then the day of the wedding before he actually went and got married,

372
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:38,640
we went to the zoo to watch monkeys jerk it.

373
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:42,240
That's 100% true.

374
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:43,600
We did that, then we left.

375
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:46,000
That was a pretty good start to the wedded bliss, I guess.

376
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:50,320
Mini golf is like the shittiest bachelor party, I think.

377
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:51,840
I don't think it's just mini golf.

378
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:53,520
I think they're starting with mini golf.

379
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:54,720
That's so early, though.

380
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:59,120
If you start partying at nine o'clock, you can't party all day.

381
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:00,080
Maybe that's the idea.

382
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:03,520
Do you think it's sexy mini golf?

383
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:08,960
Like there are ladies there that dance while they play it.

384
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:11,360
To try to distract them even with their hips and shaking and stuff?

385
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:11,920
Yeah, yeah.

386
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:14,880
So like instead of a windmill, it's like a sexy lady.

387
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:17,600
And maybe she's like swinging her arms.

388
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:24,160
Like just like at the end of the game, they'll put out.

389
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:25,360
Please go to the next question.

390
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:30,000
Last night, I ordered delivery for my local eatery.

391
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,960
When the food showed up, it happened to be delivered by a friend of mine who I met this

392
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:33,460
semester.

393
00:20:34,160 --> 00:20:38,480
We chatted a bit, and when I wondered what I was supposed to do for a tip, it's weird

394
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:41,520
tipping a friend because it's like paying them for hanging out.

395
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:43,520
Am I supposed to tip more because he's a friend?

396
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:46,480
What do I do if this situation rises again?

397
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:47,840
Okay, Ben.

398
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:48,560
That's from Ben.

399
00:20:48,560 --> 00:20:53,840
Ben, it may have seemed weird to you, but I'm pretty sure he probably wanted that tip.

400
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:55,200
Yeah, I'm sorry.

401
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:56,960
The answer is you tip more.

402
00:20:57,520 --> 00:21:01,520
Yeah, because like he's your friend, so it's an opportunity to give him money guilt free.

403
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:05,040
So you should probably just give him like probably give him a good amount of money.

404
00:21:05,040 --> 00:21:09,760
I also like how that question evolved from it was some dude that I met this semester,

405
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:12,880
but he's like my best friend, so I shouldn't have to tip him, right?

406
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:14,640
Like we're too close for that.

407
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:16,160
I think you want.

408
00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:16,880
Here's the thing.

409
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:18,640
You just want to get it's not weird.

410
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:23,280
You just want to give them because it's like it's their job, you know, so they want to

411
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:28,240
get paid to do it like so just give them a nicer tip than you would normally give to

412
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:34,720
somebody and I think that they'll have warm feelings about you and they won't break up

413
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:36,800
with you break up with your friendship.

414
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:41,680
And I tell you as a dude who delivered food when I rolled up to a friend's house.

415
00:21:42,560 --> 00:21:47,520
In my mind, like it was a big checkmark of now I know I'm getting a good tip because

416
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:50,480
they're my friend, you know, they're going to appreciate that.

417
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:51,520
Hey, I know this guy.

418
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:54,160
I know this guy, so if you were like, oh, this is weird.

419
00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:56,880
Nope, could we could we play on that?

420
00:21:56,880 --> 00:22:01,440
Could if you're like a food deliverer and a small town, can you just be friends with

421
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:01,920
everyone?

422
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:05,120
So people like, oh, oh, Ben's here.

423
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:07,760
I think that's a good idea.

424
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:09,280
Let's make it rain on that fool.

425
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:13,920
Let's take it one step further and get them so paid.

426
00:22:13,920 --> 00:22:18,960
Set up a delivery service for your friends or like say that they're sitting around.

427
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:19,920
They want some Taco Bell.

428
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:23,360
They call you, you drive to Taco Bell, pick up their food and bring it to them.

429
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:24,160
And they tip you.

430
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:31,120
You get a whole network of people at your at your food station, at your food stand,

431
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:36,320
so that you have a person for every single person that lives in your town.

432
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:39,520
Hey, anybody know Jerry?

433
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:40,640
Like, I know Jerry.

434
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:41,680
Like, go get him.

435
00:22:41,680 --> 00:22:43,680
Go get his go get his tips.

436
00:22:43,680 --> 00:22:44,320
Go get some.

437
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:45,200
Get that's on.

438
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:45,840
Bring it to him.

439
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:52,160
So how embarrassing was what this person ordered that they say they ordered delivery from a

440
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:53,200
local eatery?

441
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:54,000
What did you get?

442
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:56,720
Because there's something you're hiding here.

443
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:58,160
You're covering up something, Ben.

444
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:00,480
I'm a good enough detective.

445
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:03,680
I'm a good enough private dick to know when someone's hiding a food choice.

446
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:04,480
Oh, maybe that's it.

447
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:08,000
Hey, hey, Ben, here's your novelty dick shaped pizza.

448
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:10,480
Happy Valentine's Day.

449
00:23:11,040 --> 00:23:12,960
This is the first one we've made of these.

450
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:15,920
Is there a dick shaped pizza that's not a novelty?

451
00:23:15,920 --> 00:23:18,800
Here's your average boring dick shaped pizza.

452
00:23:19,920 --> 00:23:21,200
Here's your run of the mill.

453
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:27,200
Um, I, uh, yeah, just give him a give him a tasty, tasty tip.

454
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:31,040
And I think that they'll really they'll you'll be friends.

455
00:23:31,040 --> 00:23:31,520
Griffin.

456
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:36,080
You got any more of those Yahoo answers just sort of lying around?

457
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:37,200
Yeah, how about this one?

458
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:37,680
How about this?

459
00:23:37,680 --> 00:23:39,520
This one was sent in by Haley Keller.

460
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:40,560
Thank you, Haley.

461
00:23:40,560 --> 00:23:41,760
Thanks, Hales.

462
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:43,360
It's by Yahoo answers user.

463
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:46,800
Iggy is being constantly reported.

464
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:47,280
Thanks.

465
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:53,920
Who asks, do you hate people who urinate loudly?

466
00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:58,720
I am listening to it right now.

467
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:05,120
And it's taking all I have to not to start shouting at them to piss quietly.

468
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:06,800
As I know that would sound strange.

469
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:10,240
And I don't feel like I should be judging or trying to control the way people urinate

470
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:13,040
when they are presumably relaxing and doing something private.

471
00:24:13,040 --> 00:24:16,000
But it's just a pet peeve, you might say.

472
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:19,040
I can't stand the noise when it happens to me.

473
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:23,040
So I can't understand people who urinate so loud that it sounds like the roof is going

474
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:24,640
to cave in from water pressure.

475
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:25,280
Oh, God.

476
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:27,840
I don't mean normal urinating, by the way.

477
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:29,440
I mean loud.

478
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:31,280
Yes, I realize this question is weird.

479
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:35,600
Jimmy, Jimmy, turn down the nozzle.

480
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:36,240
Yeah, dog.

481
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:38,320
You're blowing my ears out.

482
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:41,440
Narrow your aperture.

483
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:46,080
Like, what kind of pressure are you dealing with?

484
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:47,600
When was the last time you peed?

485
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:50,240
I do know what he's talking about, though.

486
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:52,480
Not from the annoyance, not the annoyance.

487
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:58,400
But you go into you go to the bathroom, you see like some giant 60 year old Greek dude.

488
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:00,080
That's who it always seems to be.

489
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:04,160
And he'll just open up like, whoa, are you dumping out a big gulp in there?

490
00:25:04,160 --> 00:25:04,960
What's going on?

491
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:09,840
I want to I want to go a little bit deeper and set this question.

492
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:10,880
I bet you do.

493
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:11,760
Gross.

494
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:12,000
What?

495
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:13,040
What?

496
00:25:13,040 --> 00:25:18,400
OK, I want to talk about technology in the modern day where this gentleman is able to

497
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:23,600
listen to really loud urination and simultaneously ask Yahoo answers about it.

498
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:26,480
I feel like there needs to be some distance between those two events.

499
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:29,520
I presume he was just dictating it to his secretary.

500
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:32,320
Is that is that not accurate?

501
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:40,320
Margaret, take notes dictated, but not read from Stephen Billshop.

502
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:44,960
Can can you can you control?

503
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:46,320
Can you control your pressure?

504
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:49,120
Oh, you got to get that tantric peeing.

505
00:25:50,160 --> 00:25:51,040
Oh, God.

506
00:25:51,040 --> 00:25:51,600
Oh, no.

507
00:25:57,840 --> 00:25:59,040
OK, so we get it.

508
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:00,480
It's not like a super soaker.

509
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:04,240
We're like, I pump it four times and it only goes 50.

510
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:07,760
Yeah, if you're if you're in the studio, his thing is like, I want to go take a pee.

511
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:12,000
Usually your answer is like, I'm going to go to the DMV or go get a hotel room or something

512
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:14,400
because I can't I can't wait for that.

513
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:14,880
I'll see you.

514
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:15,520
I'll see you tomorrow.

515
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:15,840
Stay.

516
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:19,040
No, but the nice thing, the nice thing is he has so much control over it.

517
00:26:19,040 --> 00:26:20,560
He can do it in a second.

518
00:26:21,280 --> 00:26:22,080
Oh, right.

519
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:22,640
He can just walk in.

520
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:23,140
Done.

521
00:26:24,160 --> 00:26:26,800
It sounds like Niagara Falls.

522
00:26:26,800 --> 00:26:30,160
But it sounds like Niagara Falls.

523
00:26:30,160 --> 00:26:33,120
It sounds like somebody throwing a water balloon in a fat person.

524
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:35,280
It's just like done out.

525
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:39,040
I do feel bad for Sting.

526
00:26:39,040 --> 00:26:43,200
I think he's got a bum rap because everybody talks about his tantric sex

527
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:46,400
and nobody remembers his his his hit music.

528
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:50,400
You know, Fields of Gold was written about his urination.

529
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:50,960
Stop it.

530
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:52,400
It's true.

531
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:55,760
To be fair, he is the poster boy of tantric anything, right?

532
00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:58,320
You hear the word tantric and immediately go to Sting.

533
00:26:58,320 --> 00:26:59,680
I bet he loves that.

534
00:26:59,680 --> 00:27:01,600
Have you ever played tantric mini golf with him?

535
00:27:02,560 --> 00:27:04,160
That's why you have to start at nine.

536
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:06,480
Otherwise, it takes slightly longer than normal mini golf.

537
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:07,040
Yeah.

538
00:27:07,040 --> 00:27:08,000
Sting, holy fuck.

539
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,120
You got you.

540
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:10,880
You shot a seven hundred and thirty.

541
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:14,960
How did you even do this?

542
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:15,840
It's next week.

543
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:18,800
We missed the wedding.

544
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:20,000
We missed the wedding, Sting.

545
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,320
Sting, we missed the wedding by six whole days.

546
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:24,000
How are you so bad at this?

547
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:27,520
Do you guys get a hint of jealousy from this question?

548
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:30,960
Doesn't it seem like this person wishes they could have

549
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:32,880
just a column of pee,

550
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:34,080
just a jet of urine,

551
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:37,200
a defiant blast of urine,

552
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:40,400
just like just something that like picks him up like a little kid

553
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:42,480
holding a fire hose in an 80s movie,

554
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:44,560
just like spinning around, you know.

555
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:49,040
Oh, speaking of making mouth noises,

556
00:27:49,040 --> 00:27:50,320
that's the guy I can't stand.

557
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:51,840
Have the loudest urination you want.

558
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:53,920
But I'm tired of these guys who start peeing and then go,

559
00:27:56,320 --> 00:27:57,680
like, what are they doing?

560
00:27:58,320 --> 00:28:00,400
Yeah, they're enjoying themselves.

561
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:02,320
Is it time yet?

562
00:28:03,280 --> 00:28:04,480
It's so time, man.

563
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:05,760
Like for the money zone?

564
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:22,000
Yeah, like for the money zone.

565
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:25,360
So this week, the money zone is another sponsorship.

566
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:30,720
We are officially endorsing Alison Borges,

567
00:28:31,280 --> 00:28:33,280
a friend of the show, Alison Borges, I should say,

568
00:28:33,280 --> 00:28:36,880
to be named the official graduate.

569
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:39,840
I want to say the official 2011 graduate,

570
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:42,080
because we're probably going to get a lot of other graduates,

571
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:45,520
but the official 2011 graduate of my brother,

572
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:46,720
my brother and me.

573
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:50,240
And we are forsaking all other graduates.

574
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:52,480
That seems like a blessing and a curse.

575
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:55,200
The amount of pressure that Alison has on her now

576
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:56,880
to live up to that title.

577
00:28:56,880 --> 00:28:58,800
To succeed, right?

578
00:28:58,800 --> 00:29:01,120
You think she can slap that bitch on a resume?

579
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:01,600
Oh, yeah.

580
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:03,040
Oh, yeah.

581
00:29:03,040 --> 00:29:04,880
Well, so she got a degree in zoology, right?

582
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:07,360
So when she rolls up to a zoo,

583
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:10,240
I mean, it's the first thing that springs to mind,

584
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:12,880
and she says, hey, Mr. Zookeeper,

585
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:14,880
you should hire me to take care of the monkeys

586
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:15,840
who are jerking it,

587
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:18,240
because I am the official graduate

588
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:19,600
of my brother, my brother and me.

589
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:22,080
Class of 2000 in heaven.

590
00:29:25,040 --> 00:29:26,560
Well, that makes it sound like she's dead.

591
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:28,240
Isn't she?

592
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:29,280
Is she not dead?

593
00:29:29,280 --> 00:29:31,360
Now that college is over, it might as well be.

594
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:31,760
Oh, god.

595
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:33,040
It's all downhill from here.

596
00:29:33,040 --> 00:29:35,360
You made the biggest mistake of your life.

597
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:37,360
Haven't you seen Van Wilder?

598
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:39,280
You gotta stay in college, you guys.

599
00:29:40,160 --> 00:29:41,040
As long as you can.

600
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:43,920
Where'd all my friends go?

601
00:29:43,920 --> 00:29:46,160
Ah, that's right, college ended.

602
00:29:46,160 --> 00:29:47,360
I miss all of them.

603
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:49,440
Why do I only see them at lunch

604
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:50,560
at the Indian restaurant?

605
00:29:51,280 --> 00:29:52,240
Because you're old now.

606
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:53,840
You're an old person.

607
00:29:53,840 --> 00:29:55,760
I'm disappointed in you, Alison,

608
00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:59,360
but I'm proud of you and your friend,

609
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:03,600
and your special somebody, Nick Coffin,

610
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:09,120
wanted us to name you our official graduate.

611
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:13,360
So congratulations, and Griffin,

612
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:15,120
let's move on to the next question.

613
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:17,360
No, but I think there was a thing.

614
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:20,000
I think, well, I'm looking at this.

615
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,240
I'm pretty sure there was a special note

616
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:23,040
on this question.

617
00:30:23,040 --> 00:30:25,120
Not seeing any notes.

618
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:27,840
That Nick Coffin specifically wanted you

619
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:29,280
to do the jingle for Alison.

620
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:35,840
So let's go ahead and let's get out that sixth string.

621
00:30:35,840 --> 00:30:37,360
And kick it off one time.

622
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:38,960
Let's pluck them out.

623
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:40,160
I don't know how to,

624
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:43,200
I don't play guitar like you do, though.

625
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:45,200
Get out your sixth string and let's pluck one out.

626
00:30:46,160 --> 00:30:48,240
You always sort of freestyle.

627
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:53,680
Yeah, going well.

628
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:01,440
This is a pretty chord progression.

629
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:08,320
Shy, la, la, la, la, la, don't be shy.

630
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:13,120
Why, why you gotta graduate?

631
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:17,360
Shy, la, la, la, la, la, don't be shy.

632
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,640
You gotta don't play or hate.

633
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:30,160
Whoa, there's some science doing it across the room.

634
00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:34,720
Go and find some gold doubloons.

635
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:45,280
Come on, learn about goats.

636
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:47,200
Graduate.

637
00:31:52,800 --> 00:31:54,160
Study books.

638
00:31:54,160 --> 00:31:56,480
Don't mind their dirty looks.

639
00:31:56,480 --> 00:31:58,800
You gotta graduate.

640
00:31:58,800 --> 00:32:03,680
Whoa, la, la, la, la, la, get some paper.

641
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:05,920
Earn some cash.

642
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:08,720
Don't discriminate.

643
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:11,520
Whoa, whoa, come on, Alison.

644
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:16,800
Wear that robe and learn about any animals around with robe.

645
00:32:19,280 --> 00:32:19,840
Antelopes.

646
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:24,240
Whoa, whoa, come on, Alison.

647
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:26,000
We're proud of you.

648
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:30,560
Don't let us down to just like a cockatoo.

649
00:32:39,280 --> 00:32:40,880
Oh, yeah.

650
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:41,680
Nailed it.

651
00:32:41,680 --> 00:32:42,640
Chunky ending.

652
00:32:43,680 --> 00:32:44,720
That was good, right?

653
00:32:46,160 --> 00:32:47,200
Two notes.

654
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:48,480
Like Stevie Ray Yon.

655
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:50,560
Two notes.

656
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:54,240
You did great with all the animals.

657
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:57,600
You named at least two animals in there, one fake animal.

658
00:32:59,120 --> 00:33:02,000
Also, the gold doubloons part, you kind of lost me a little bit.

659
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:08,640
I did just want to say gold doubloons did not have a good connector there.

660
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:12,480
I assumed that was because she was going to study in South America and, you know,

661
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:14,880
Cortez and gold doubloons and everything.

662
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:15,360
Mayans.

663
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:20,000
Hard to say.

664
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:21,120
So congratulations, Alison.

665
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:29,200
How about another question from our dear friends out there on the internet?

666
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:33,760
Just a reminder, if you want to send us a question, mbnbam at maximumfun.org.

667
00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:39,520
Our form spring is formspring.me forward slash mbnbam, or you can use Twitter.

668
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:42,320
Just use the mbnbam hashtag.

669
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:47,920
If you want us to take you to the money zone, you just got to contact Teresa at maximumfun.org.

670
00:33:47,920 --> 00:33:49,520
That's Teresa with an H.

671
00:33:49,520 --> 00:33:52,400
It's a hundred dollars for a personal message like that one right there,

672
00:33:52,400 --> 00:33:54,400
or $200 for a business message.

673
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:58,640
But either way, you still get a jingle to the tune of a Disney song.

674
00:33:59,520 --> 00:34:02,080
I'm pretty renowned writer in my neck of the woods.

675
00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:04,560
So I often have people run up to me on the street,

676
00:34:04,560 --> 00:34:07,920
show a manuscript into my hand and breathlessly explain.

677
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:12,640
There's might be the next great American novel with a little help from me.

678
00:34:12,640 --> 00:34:13,760
I usually decline.

679
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:16,960
But when one of my bestest buddies asked me to read his own work, I couldn't refuse.

680
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:21,760
My question for you guys, how do I let my friend know that he sucks

681
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:25,360
and just pinned a pile of shit without saying it like that?

682
00:34:25,360 --> 00:34:31,200
Also, he's a little dyslexic, feeling preemptively sucky,

683
00:34:31,920 --> 00:34:37,120
or shitty, sorry, feeling preemptively shitty in Chicago.

684
00:34:37,120 --> 00:34:38,560
Man, this sucks.

685
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:42,800
Hey, listen, if he listens to our show, just let us tell him.

686
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:44,480
We just did.

687
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:47,280
Are you a friend of a prolific author in Chicago?

688
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:48,880
Because you're probably bad at writing.

689
00:34:48,880 --> 00:34:50,720
Are you slightly dyslexic?

690
00:34:50,720 --> 00:34:51,200
You suck.

691
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:53,840
You're not good at writing.

692
00:34:53,840 --> 00:34:56,800
Maybe audiobooks is the way to go for you.

693
00:34:56,800 --> 00:35:01,040
Maybe you could give him just like a positive

694
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:04,800
and then two negatives into infinity.

695
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:06,720
Like if you're like, I really like the title,

696
00:35:07,520 --> 00:35:10,400
but your characters are all shitty and your punctuation is terrible.

697
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:12,640
So you're saying you give him one step forward

698
00:35:12,640 --> 00:35:15,280
and two steps back until he hangs himself.

699
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:15,920
Right.

700
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:18,000
So you give him like, you say like,

701
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:21,040
I really like the paper you used,

702
00:35:21,040 --> 00:35:22,960
but everything on it is just the worst.

703
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:23,760
Great font.

704
00:35:25,120 --> 00:35:26,080
Terrible story.

705
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:31,280
You spelled many of the words correctly.

706
00:35:31,840 --> 00:35:34,720
But this is clearly the plot to Weekend at Bernie's.

707
00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:36,960
You are just copying Bernie's style.

708
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:42,800
What you've done here is you've written a book adaptation of Weekend at Bernie's.

709
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:45,120
But bad, so bad.

710
00:35:45,120 --> 00:35:47,040
But like bad, like super dyslexic.

711
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:51,680
Like the most dyslexic version there could be.

712
00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:56,160
Everyone knows that in Weekend at Bernie's, Bernie was dead.

713
00:35:56,160 --> 00:36:00,320
Well, my book presupposes maybe he isn't.

714
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:03,600
I would read that book, by the way, if he came back.

715
00:36:03,600 --> 00:36:06,400
What if he came back and started solving crimes?

716
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:07,520
He was a detective.

717
00:36:07,520 --> 00:36:09,440
Oh, but like afterlife crimes.

718
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:10,400
Afterlife crimes.

719
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:10,640
Right.

720
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:15,120
Like Beetlejuice basically mixed with Dead Men Don't Wear a Plan.

721
00:36:15,120 --> 00:36:16,240
Something like that.

722
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:16,960
Exactly.

723
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:17,280
Like Medium.

724
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:18,320
I've watched that.

725
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:20,080
Like the TV show Medium?

726
00:36:20,080 --> 00:36:21,040
Like Medium.

727
00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:22,320
Like the TV show Medium.

728
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:23,440
Or like The Closer.

729
00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:26,800
What are we doing?

730
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:27,760
Are we just randomly?

731
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:30,240
Maybe it's like Saving Grace.

732
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:32,400
Guys, guys, guys.

733
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:34,400
Maybe it's like The Ghost Whisperer.

734
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:35,840
Travis, Justin.

735
00:36:35,840 --> 00:36:36,560
Yeah?

736
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:36,800
Yeah.

737
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:38,000
Cold Case.

738
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:46,480
So tell your friend to watch Cold Case.

739
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:50,560
Hey, here's one that I always like to use.

740
00:36:51,120 --> 00:36:53,520
Why is the burden of truth placed on you?

741
00:36:54,160 --> 00:36:59,520
Clearly people throughout this person's life have told them that they are good,

742
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:00,960
that they're better than they are.

743
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:03,760
Why can't you just pass that buck?

744
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:05,760
Pass it on up the drain.

745
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:07,120
Say like, yeah, this is good.

746
00:37:07,120 --> 00:37:07,840
I like it.

747
00:37:07,840 --> 00:37:08,960
I like reading it.

748
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:10,560
I would give it to someone else.

749
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:11,280
See what they think.

750
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:18,320
You could also always switch for the lesser douche move of saying you never got a chance to read it.

751
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:20,960
Like just stay out of it.

752
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:23,360
And maybe you're the jerk who couldn't take the time to read it,

753
00:37:23,360 --> 00:37:26,160
but you're not the jerk who has to lie to his friend or tell him he's crappy.

754
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:31,600
Yeah, because it's not worth sacrificing the friendship for the truth.

755
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:33,600
You know what?

756
00:37:33,600 --> 00:37:34,800
Here's another thing to think about.

757
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:37,360
Snooki just published a book.

758
00:37:37,360 --> 00:37:41,120
Like shit goes out all the time that people like.

759
00:37:41,120 --> 00:37:43,520
There's no reason to say people won't like it just because it sucks.

760
00:37:44,080 --> 00:37:45,360
Lots of things that suck.

761
00:37:45,360 --> 00:37:50,800
But you could have been the one person who like could have avoided that whole situation.

762
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:55,040
See, that's where I think it gets tricky because as his friend,

763
00:37:55,760 --> 00:37:57,440
is it his duty to say,

764
00:37:57,440 --> 00:38:00,960
hey, this should probably end with you and I,

765
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:02,720
and you probably shouldn't show this to anyone else

766
00:38:02,720 --> 00:38:04,720
because I think it needs a lot of work.

767
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:06,240
What's the harm though?

768
00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:10,160
Like it's not going to be any worse if he's just going to tell him that he sucks.

769
00:38:10,160 --> 00:38:13,920
Like it's not going to be any worse than some agent like him not being able to get traction on it.

770
00:38:15,120 --> 00:38:18,560
Well, I think it's because like this dude is very clearly a respected

771
00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:20,560
writer in his neck of the woods, as he says.

772
00:38:20,560 --> 00:38:22,800
And like, it seems like as an artist,

773
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:26,480
it's his job to make sure that good art is being produced.

774
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:30,480
Yeah, but his is that friendship responsibility comes first.

775
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:33,600
So yeah, I'll agree with that.

776
00:38:33,600 --> 00:38:34,240
Lie to him.

777
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:35,680
Just lie, right?

778
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:36,240
Lie to me.

779
00:38:36,240 --> 00:38:37,600
That's another TV show.

780
00:38:37,600 --> 00:38:39,920
Or just let us do it.

781
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:40,720
We don't care.

782
00:38:40,720 --> 00:38:41,520
Hey, Kevin.

783
00:38:42,160 --> 00:38:42,880
Oh, it's amazing.

784
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:44,560
Do you did a great job.

785
00:38:44,560 --> 00:38:46,080
Take some night classes maybe.

786
00:38:46,080 --> 00:38:47,360
Yeah, but I think you're close.

787
00:38:47,360 --> 00:38:48,160
I think you're really close.

788
00:38:48,160 --> 00:38:49,360
It's really good.

789
00:38:49,360 --> 00:38:50,720
Oh, I can feel it.

790
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:53,840
Maybe just change a couple of the character names

791
00:38:53,840 --> 00:38:57,120
and like locations and like the events that happen.

792
00:38:57,120 --> 00:38:58,640
Yeah, like you're really close to me.

793
00:38:58,640 --> 00:39:00,640
I'm not sure this feels like a script to me, though.

794
00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:04,720
To me, it feels like an episode of CatDog.

795
00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:06,400
And maybe with just some reworking,

796
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:10,240
you could have a CatDog script published, printed,

797
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:12,400
have your name in lights, I guess.

798
00:39:13,120 --> 00:39:14,000
You guys want a Yahoo?

799
00:39:14,640 --> 00:39:15,360
Yes, please.

800
00:39:15,360 --> 00:39:16,800
Yeah, I guess I do, actually.

801
00:39:17,360 --> 00:39:19,360
Unless there's like a super fresh question that you want.

802
00:39:19,360 --> 00:39:21,600
No, like I kind of want a Yahoo now for each.

803
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:22,960
How about a Yahoo answer?

804
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:25,280
This one was sent in by Gali Ayali.

805
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:26,000
Thank you, Gali.

806
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:29,280
It's by Yahoo Answers user, question mark, who asks,

807
00:39:31,120 --> 00:39:33,840
what is an awesome wedding theme?

808
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:42,960
Example, Jamaica, Lion King, New York, Asia, et cetera.

809
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:44,400
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

810
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:45,200
Whoa, whoa.

811
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:48,800
Hold on, did I mean to say prom, but instead I said wedding?

812
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:51,040
Nope, that is the word.

813
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:53,600
Can you give me those possibilities again?

814
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:54,480
Let's run them back.

815
00:39:54,480 --> 00:39:56,160
Yeah, give me a replay.

816
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:57,680
Let's play that tape back.

817
00:39:58,240 --> 00:39:59,360
Jamaica, okay?

818
00:39:59,360 --> 00:40:00,080
Weird.

819
00:40:00,080 --> 00:40:01,520
Lion King, dig it.

820
00:40:01,520 --> 00:40:02,720
New York, sure.

821
00:40:02,720 --> 00:40:05,600
Asia, it's kind of a lot of things is Asia.

822
00:40:05,600 --> 00:40:07,040
Asia is kind of a lot of things.

823
00:40:07,840 --> 00:40:11,200
Asia is very mini, unless you're talking about the band Asia,

824
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:13,680
which that would be a pretty good wedding.

825
00:40:13,680 --> 00:40:14,400
Pretty baller.

826
00:40:15,440 --> 00:40:18,800
I think that those are all equally good.

827
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:20,720
Those are all equally great themes.

828
00:40:20,720 --> 00:40:22,960
I'm gonna throw out the, it's a great test though,

829
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:27,200
because if you have found an SO that agrees with you

830
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:29,440
that you should have a Lion King themed wedding,

831
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:31,200
you are meant for each other.

832
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:32,960
I think you forgot some possibilities.

833
00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:37,200
There's Enchantment Under the Sea, Arabian Nights.

834
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:39,120
Paradise City.

835
00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:43,200
One Night Only is one that would be good.

836
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:44,320
Snow Princess.

837
00:40:44,320 --> 00:40:45,920
Snow Princess wedding.

838
00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:47,120
One Night in Bangkok.

839
00:40:48,240 --> 00:40:49,680
Well, I think Asia would.

840
00:40:49,680 --> 00:40:54,000
Well, First Night in Bangkok, actually, if it's a wedding, right?

841
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:55,120
One Night in Paris.

842
00:40:56,480 --> 00:40:57,760
I think that that's a bad one.

843
00:40:57,760 --> 00:40:58,960
I don't think that that's very good.

844
00:41:00,240 --> 00:41:05,760
Do weddings have themes in the way that parade floats have themes?

845
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:07,120
I was not aware of this.

846
00:41:07,120 --> 00:41:08,720
I did not know that weddings have-

847
00:41:08,720 --> 00:41:11,600
You get a wedding marshal and then the Shriners show up.

848
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:16,880
Do you license the rights to your wedding out to whichever Disney property

849
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:18,320
hasn't been produced there for a while?

850
00:41:18,320 --> 00:41:23,120
For Justin's wedding, the ring man was actually a Shriner in a little car.

851
00:41:23,120 --> 00:41:23,600
He drove it up.

852
00:41:23,600 --> 00:41:24,240
It was cool.

853
00:41:24,240 --> 00:41:25,040
Drove it up the aisle.

854
00:41:25,040 --> 00:41:26,080
Sorry, the what?

855
00:41:26,640 --> 00:41:27,680
The Shriner?

856
00:41:27,680 --> 00:41:28,640
No, no, no, before that.

857
00:41:29,600 --> 00:41:31,040
What position did he fill?

858
00:41:31,040 --> 00:41:31,920
He was the ring bearer.

859
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:33,840
You said ring man.

860
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:37,200
Did I?

861
00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:38,400
He was the ring man.

862
00:41:39,760 --> 00:41:43,760
Now, if you're talking about a wrestling themed wedding right now, I'm fucking there.

863
00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:44,240
No, no, no.

864
00:41:45,840 --> 00:41:46,800
We've done that.

865
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:48,320
We've done that wedding.

866
00:41:48,320 --> 00:41:48,960
Now we're talking about-

867
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:50,320
Now we're all about Asia.

868
00:41:54,880 --> 00:41:57,920
Is there some reason that your wedding can't be wedding themed?

869
00:42:00,720 --> 00:42:04,160
Answer one said, how about affordable?

870
00:42:04,160 --> 00:42:09,440
Or love, marriage, and commitment, not five-year-old's birthday party.

871
00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:18,080
My favorite, my favorite, saying vows, eating, drinking, and dancing as adults, not trying to

872
00:42:18,080 --> 00:42:19,120
recreate our prom.

873
00:42:19,120 --> 00:42:22,480
Oh, question mark, pick up your face.

874
00:42:23,680 --> 00:42:28,240
I hate it when the answers are, I've already so thoroughly answered the question.

875
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:33,520
Well, hold on, because there's a second answer on here that's a little bit more constructive.

876
00:42:34,080 --> 00:42:34,720
Okay, good.

877
00:42:34,720 --> 00:42:42,960
Answer two says, some off the top of my head that are out there, Las Vegas, Star Wars,

878
00:42:44,640 --> 00:42:50,720
Candy Land, Winter Wonderland, superheroes, Mickey and Minnie Mouse.

879
00:42:52,240 --> 00:42:54,400
I thought about that and how creepy it would be.

880
00:42:54,400 --> 00:42:55,680
Okay, I'm going to throw out this.

881
00:42:55,680 --> 00:43:01,200
If your wedding has fucking mandatory face paint, you have fucked up somewhere down the line.

882
00:43:01,200 --> 00:43:06,240
Imagine you get that invitation, you get that invitation, and then you're looking at it going,

883
00:43:06,880 --> 00:43:08,000
okay, wait, I'm confused.

884
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:11,600
Why is this invitation shaped like Mickey Mouse's head?

885
00:43:11,600 --> 00:43:14,160
So you call your friend and you're like, I got the invitation.

886
00:43:15,040 --> 00:43:16,560
Is this for your kid's birthday party?

887
00:43:16,560 --> 00:43:17,200
What's going on?

888
00:43:17,200 --> 00:43:18,720
And they're like, no, it's for my wedding.

889
00:43:18,720 --> 00:43:20,880
It's Mickey and Minnie Mouse themed.

890
00:43:20,880 --> 00:43:21,600
Didn't you hear?

891
00:43:21,600 --> 00:43:23,920
I'm a fucking crazy person now.

892
00:43:23,920 --> 00:43:25,280
I got hit by that bus.

893
00:43:25,280 --> 00:43:27,840
I got hit by that bus last month, and now I'm fucking insane.

894
00:43:27,840 --> 00:43:30,960
Do you ever see that Jeff Bridges movie Fearless?

895
00:43:30,960 --> 00:43:33,520
That's me, except now I'm just really stupid.

896
00:43:33,520 --> 00:43:34,480
Tasteless.

897
00:43:34,480 --> 00:43:35,040
Tasteless.

898
00:43:36,080 --> 00:43:39,840
Do you think the douche chills would be so bad that they would travel through time

899
00:43:39,840 --> 00:43:42,480
and make you vomit as soon as you saw the invitation?

900
00:43:42,480 --> 00:43:45,200
Yeah, a winter wonderland of douche chills.

901
00:43:46,160 --> 00:43:47,200
I am freezing.

902
00:43:47,840 --> 00:43:53,520
The Flintstones, Disney princess theme, rock and roll theme, Hollywood glamour.

903
00:43:53,520 --> 00:43:57,440
See, this is what happens when we allow 12 year olds to get married.

904
00:43:57,440 --> 00:44:01,280
Yeah, people push for that age to be reduced, and then this is where we end up.

905
00:44:01,840 --> 00:44:03,280
Hollywood glamour.

906
00:44:03,920 --> 00:44:05,200
Night before Christmas.

907
00:44:06,080 --> 00:44:06,400
What?

908
00:44:06,960 --> 00:44:07,280
What?

909
00:44:07,920 --> 00:44:09,360
This is wedding time.

910
00:44:09,360 --> 00:44:10,640
This is wedding time.

911
00:44:12,080 --> 00:44:13,040
Excuse me?

912
00:44:14,480 --> 00:44:16,240
The night before Christmas?

913
00:44:16,880 --> 00:44:18,160
Who officiated your wedding?

914
00:44:18,160 --> 00:44:19,920
Oh, I believe it was Oogie Boogie.

915
00:44:19,920 --> 00:44:21,440
It was the worst wedding ever.

916
00:44:22,800 --> 00:44:25,120
I told you we should have gone wrestling theme.

917
00:44:25,120 --> 00:44:27,920
We went with a Beethoven themed wedding.

918
00:44:27,920 --> 00:44:29,520
Oh, like all Beethoven music?

919
00:44:29,520 --> 00:44:30,400
No, like the dog.

920
00:44:30,400 --> 00:44:31,440
It was like the dog.

921
00:44:31,440 --> 00:44:33,200
He had a ring tied to him.

922
00:44:33,200 --> 00:44:34,560
It was great.

923
00:44:34,560 --> 00:44:37,600
But then I got into shenanigans and flipped over some chairs.

924
00:44:39,120 --> 00:44:40,160
I went to Charlie's wedding.

925
00:44:40,160 --> 00:44:41,120
You know what he did?

926
00:44:41,120 --> 00:44:41,600
Thor.

927
00:44:41,600 --> 00:44:42,560
Thor themed wedding.

928
00:44:42,560 --> 00:44:43,760
It was so fucking awesome.

929
00:44:44,400 --> 00:44:45,200
Loki was there.

930
00:44:45,920 --> 00:44:49,520
Everyone saw it in 2D and 3D and screen near you.

931
00:44:49,520 --> 00:44:50,160
Super romantic.

932
00:44:50,160 --> 00:44:51,280
You got to choose.

933
00:44:51,280 --> 00:44:55,200
There's a bride side, groom side, 2D side and 3D side.

934
00:44:55,200 --> 00:44:56,320
Fucking sick wedding.

935
00:44:56,320 --> 00:44:58,400
Four Siders Arena Theater.

936
00:44:58,400 --> 00:45:02,640
Hey, wouldn't that be the best priest though if he stood up,

937
00:45:02,640 --> 00:45:05,680
saw him in their Fred and Wilma costumes and then just said,

938
00:45:05,680 --> 00:45:07,200
Dearly beloved.

939
00:45:07,200 --> 00:45:07,600
Nope.

940
00:45:11,200 --> 00:45:13,040
Yabba dabba divorced.

941
00:45:13,040 --> 00:45:17,200
I'm just going to throw out anyone who ever argues that

942
00:45:17,200 --> 00:45:22,000
that legalizing gay marriage takes something away from the

943
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:25,680
sanctity of marriage to justify that point.

944
00:45:25,680 --> 00:45:28,800
You're going to have to hunt down this question asker and

945
00:45:28,800 --> 00:45:31,920
kill them with your bare hands.

946
00:45:31,920 --> 00:45:32,880
With your bare hands.

947
00:45:32,880 --> 00:45:35,200
And there has to be a picture of it in the front page of the

948
00:45:35,200 --> 00:45:35,840
newspaper.

949
00:45:36,720 --> 00:45:38,960
Sanctity of marriage confirmed.

950
00:45:38,960 --> 00:45:39,680
Wedding safe again.

951
00:45:39,680 --> 00:45:41,600
Flintstone wedding burned to ground.

952
00:45:42,320 --> 00:45:46,000
I want to hear Griffin's last question, but real quick.

953
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:48,880
We've already told you how you can ask us a question, so we

954
00:45:48,880 --> 00:45:50,080
won't go into that again.

955
00:45:50,080 --> 00:45:53,360
But we will tell you that mbnbam.com is our website.

956
00:45:53,360 --> 00:45:55,680
Got all kinds of interactive interactive elements.

957
00:45:55,680 --> 00:45:57,200
You guys like flash games.

958
00:45:57,200 --> 00:45:58,480
We don't have any of those.

959
00:45:58,480 --> 00:45:59,760
We don't have any flash games.

960
00:45:59,760 --> 00:46:00,320
Sudoku.

961
00:46:00,880 --> 00:46:02,080
You like word search?

962
00:46:02,080 --> 00:46:04,000
Don't don't have those.

963
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:04,720
Don't have those.

964
00:46:04,720 --> 00:46:09,920
Do have pictures and a lot of Aqua Aqua and yellow.

965
00:46:09,920 --> 00:46:10,800
There's a lot of those.

966
00:46:11,520 --> 00:46:13,600
So if you want those things, we have got you.

967
00:46:13,600 --> 00:46:17,200
So we have some pretty rocking forums.

968
00:46:17,200 --> 00:46:17,760
Yeah.

969
00:46:17,760 --> 00:46:18,480
Oh, that's good.

970
00:46:18,480 --> 00:46:20,000
Check out the community.

971
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:20,480
That's there.

972
00:46:21,440 --> 00:46:26,960
We are getting close to having our next live show all sort of

973
00:46:27,760 --> 00:46:28,560
straightened out.

974
00:46:28,560 --> 00:46:30,480
It's sort of in the final acts.

975
00:46:31,360 --> 00:46:33,200
Hopefully we'll be able to tell you that next week.

976
00:46:34,400 --> 00:46:35,280
That is our plan.

977
00:46:35,280 --> 00:46:36,320
Tell me where it is, though, right?

978
00:46:37,040 --> 00:46:39,280
Yeah, we are planning on having it tentatively.

979
00:46:39,280 --> 00:46:41,760
We're going to be doing a show in Travis's hometown of

980
00:46:41,760 --> 00:46:42,400
Cincinnati.

981
00:46:42,400 --> 00:46:45,360
It's probably mid-Jun ish.

982
00:46:47,040 --> 00:46:50,400
So that's the plan right now.

983
00:46:50,400 --> 00:46:51,760
Kind of clear your calendars.

984
00:46:51,760 --> 00:46:54,960
We're thinking about like June 12th, right?

985
00:46:54,960 --> 00:46:56,640
Is that the tentative date?

986
00:46:57,440 --> 00:46:59,760
Tentative tentatively guys.

987
00:46:59,760 --> 00:47:01,360
We're trying to get it all worked out for you.

988
00:47:01,360 --> 00:47:04,640
We're holding on to this idea with both hands.

989
00:47:04,640 --> 00:47:06,080
Don't stop believing.

990
00:47:06,080 --> 00:47:08,160
It's not actually as hard as we're making out to be.

991
00:47:08,160 --> 00:47:09,040
We just haven't done it.

992
00:47:09,040 --> 00:47:12,640
So it is going to be a Flintstones theme podcast live

993
00:47:12,640 --> 00:47:12,880
show.

994
00:47:14,160 --> 00:47:14,800
You're going to love it.

995
00:47:14,800 --> 00:47:15,520
It's good for you.

996
00:47:15,520 --> 00:47:16,560
Good for the kids.

997
00:47:16,560 --> 00:47:19,520
And if you know somebody, maybe like a podcast or musician,

998
00:47:19,520 --> 00:47:23,600
a stand-up comedian in the area who'd like to open up for our

999
00:47:23,600 --> 00:47:25,120
show, get in contact.

1000
00:47:25,120 --> 00:47:25,680
Reach out.

1001
00:47:27,840 --> 00:47:32,400
But we'll have hopefully details on that for you next week.

1002
00:47:32,400 --> 00:47:33,760
It's going to be bomb, though.

1003
00:47:33,760 --> 00:47:34,480
It's going to be awesome.

1004
00:47:35,120 --> 00:47:38,160
And I think that's it.

1005
00:47:38,160 --> 00:47:39,440
Do we have anything else going on?

1006
00:47:39,440 --> 00:47:40,320
Anything else cracking?

1007
00:47:41,040 --> 00:47:45,040
If you haven't yet, take a moment and go check out Jordan

1008
00:47:45,040 --> 00:47:49,040
Jesse Go and stop podcasting yourself and Judge John Hodgman

1009
00:47:49,040 --> 00:47:51,440
and all those other wonderful Max Fun podcast.

1010
00:47:51,440 --> 00:47:52,880
Did we win the friendship war?

1011
00:47:53,600 --> 00:47:54,400
We don't know.

1012
00:47:54,400 --> 00:47:56,480
I don't think we don't know, but I'm pretty sure.

1013
00:47:57,040 --> 00:47:58,720
Pretty sure we trounced them.

1014
00:47:58,720 --> 00:47:59,840
It felt like we won.

1015
00:48:00,400 --> 00:48:04,480
We got a little Twitter hashtag war with our friends over at

1016
00:48:04,480 --> 00:48:05,120
Jordan Jesse Go.

1017
00:48:05,680 --> 00:48:06,560
A tiff.

1018
00:48:06,560 --> 00:48:07,440
A tiff, I think.

1019
00:48:07,440 --> 00:48:08,400
A spat.

1020
00:48:08,400 --> 00:48:09,680
I'm pretty sure we destroyed them.

1021
00:48:10,400 --> 00:48:16,080
We do love seeing those people quoting our show and talking

1022
00:48:16,080 --> 00:48:16,720
about the show.

1023
00:48:18,080 --> 00:48:19,840
Wendy Batty, Joey Weiser.

1024
00:48:19,840 --> 00:48:21,920
They were all up in it this week.

1025
00:48:23,040 --> 00:48:23,680
We got to thank-

1026
00:48:24,480 --> 00:48:27,760
Did you guys see Willie Pond's sweet ass Peabody's nasty gum

1027
00:48:27,760 --> 00:48:28,320
hat?

1028
00:48:28,320 --> 00:48:28,720
Yes.

1029
00:48:28,720 --> 00:48:29,680
Yes, that was sweet.

1030
00:48:30,400 --> 00:48:31,360
Jen's Valor.

1031
00:48:31,360 --> 00:48:35,280
We have to say Jen's Eric Valor.

1032
00:48:35,280 --> 00:48:39,600
We have to say thank you to randomly promoting our show to

1033
00:48:39,600 --> 00:48:40,480
Julie Benz.

1034
00:48:42,480 --> 00:48:43,600
Didn't seem to catch.

1035
00:48:43,600 --> 00:48:44,800
Maybe next time.

1036
00:48:44,800 --> 00:48:45,600
Maybe next time.

1037
00:48:45,600 --> 00:48:47,520
Just keep throwing at her and see what sticks.

1038
00:48:48,240 --> 00:48:50,320
Can I throw out a personal message real quick?

1039
00:48:50,320 --> 00:48:50,640
Yes.

1040
00:48:50,640 --> 00:48:51,360
Of course.

1041
00:48:51,360 --> 00:48:53,760
I just want to say happy birthday to my wonderful girlfriend,

1042
00:48:53,760 --> 00:48:54,240
Teresa.

1043
00:48:56,240 --> 00:48:57,680
And hey, happy Mother's Day to your mom.

1044
00:48:57,680 --> 00:49:03,120
If your mom is still around, go give her a hug on the neck and

1045
00:49:03,120 --> 00:49:04,160
a peck on the cheek.

1046
00:49:04,160 --> 00:49:08,480
They say thanks, moms, for the love and support.

1047
00:49:10,320 --> 00:49:11,920
And I think that's it.

1048
00:49:11,920 --> 00:49:13,040
I think we're done.

1049
00:49:13,040 --> 00:49:13,440
All right.

1050
00:49:14,080 --> 00:49:16,400
This final question was sent in by Scatter Heart.

1051
00:49:17,120 --> 00:49:18,080
Thank you, Scatter Heart.

1052
00:49:18,080 --> 00:49:22,400
It's by Yahoo Answers user Down to Earth who says,

1053
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:26,640
where can I find an adult race car bed?

1054
00:49:31,440 --> 00:49:32,560
Justin McElroy.

1055
00:49:32,560 --> 00:49:33,680
I'm Travis McElroy.

1056
00:49:33,680 --> 00:49:35,040
I'm Griffin McElroy.

1057
00:49:35,040 --> 00:49:36,560
This has been my brother, my brother and me.

1058
00:49:36,560 --> 00:49:37,280
Kiss your dad.

1059
00:49:37,280 --> 00:50:06,560
Let's go around the Earth.
