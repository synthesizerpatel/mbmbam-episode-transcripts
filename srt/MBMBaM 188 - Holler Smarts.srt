1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:30,800
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:49,360
Hello, welcome to my brother and my brother and me special Valentine's Day edition for Lovers.

6
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:55,200
I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy, Lovers. I'm your... I can't go on this journey with you.

7
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:59,200
I'm your middle-aged brother, Travis McElroy. Kiss my mouth, it's covered in oil.

8
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:02,480
I respect you as friends. My mouth is covered in kissing

9
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:06,400
oil. Oh God, what is that?

10
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:09,040
Kissing oil. Kissing oil, I bought it at...

11
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:12,960
From whom? I bought it from a man at Hardee's.

12
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:16,080
Oh God. I was at Hardee's,

13
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:20,000
and I bought kissing oil from a man. Was he an employee of Hardee's,

14
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,120
or was he just there? He was a man in a bathroom,

15
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:28,080
and he had a guy, Fox Mask, and he told me he would help me kiss better.

16
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:31,040
I'm Griffin and the baby. Oh no.

17
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:39,040
Guys, let's compare and contrast our Valentine's Day experiences,

18
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:44,560
because I am willing to bet that I had not only the worst of the three people on this podcast,

19
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:53,840
but of the three billion people on earth. This V-Day, my wife and I celebrated our last

20
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:59,520
Valentine's Day without a child. You're just going to casually drop

21
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:03,360
that bomb on the show, by the way. Yeah, well, we already dropped it on

22
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:07,040
Sawbones. That's where you need to go for your world exclusive baby news.

23
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:18,640
So we celebrated it by going to the Greenbrier, which is a resort at the eastern edge of West

24
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:26,480
Virginia. It's 236 years old. Like 30, maybe 50 presidents have stayed there,

25
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:29,920
and it's got a Cold War bunker in the bottom. Pretty tight.

26
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:33,280
And a casino. Very romantic. What about you, Trev?

27
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:38,480
Theresa and I, we spent a day at a Louisville bed and breakfast,

28
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:44,000
and spent a day exploring Louisville, eating at fancy restaurants, and going to museums.

29
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:53,600
Oh, Rachel and I spent our Valentine's Day with her, just sort of watching me

30
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:57,200
writhe on the couch. Sounds sexy so far.

31
00:02:58,160 --> 00:03:05,280
I wasn't writhing with sexual avarice. I wasn't writhing because I was burning with an

32
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:14,560
invisible sexual flame. An invisible flame. It's because I had, and get out your abacus,

33
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:22,240
get out your admin machines, I had a sinus infection, and then also some diarrhea,

34
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:34,160
and then I also had athlete's foot. I had a sinus infection, and I had diarrhea,

35
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:40,320
and I had athlete's foot. So that was a pretty stellar Valentine's.

36
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:44,000
Is it possible that they were all side effects of being addicted to love?

37
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:48,240
I think that may have had something. Maybe it was the kissing oil,

38
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:52,400
like a side effect of the kissing oil. It was not FDA approved.

39
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:57,760
Griffin could have gotten ovarian migraines, and the doctor would have found it less surprising.

40
00:03:57,760 --> 00:03:58,560
I did go to the doctor.

41
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:00,560
More surprising than getting athlete's foot.

42
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:05,200
I went to the doctor, and she was like, you obviously have a sinus infection.

43
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:12,800
I was like, yeah, but check this out. Also, dye dye, and plus, check out my toes.

44
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:18,960
I was like, is there a weird connection? She was like, no, you eat like a dumb shit,

45
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:21,120
and don't clean your feet in the shower.

46
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:25,040
You should contact Dr. House, because I'm betting they're connected.

47
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:27,200
There's got to be a connection.

48
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:31,040
Let me take a look in his house. Oh, he's just a dirty boy, and he eats stupid food.

49
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:38,640
I had a thing happen to me the day after Valentine's Day that I wanted to bounce off

50
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:41,920
of you guys, because this is an advice show. It's an advice podcast from Modern Era.

51
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:45,760
I'm still not sure if I did the right thing in this situation,

52
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:48,800
but it was when I was colon rolling on some Sudafed.

53
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:52,480
I went outside late at night. I was watching Curling.

54
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:58,560
It was like 1 a.m., and my cat, who was outside, was perched underneath the tree,

55
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:01,520
and he was looking up in the tree, and there were two giant possums

56
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:03,760
in the branches of the tree in my neighbor's yard.

57
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:08,640
I didn't want my cat to get in a fight with these possums and get rabies and die.

58
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:15,920
My inclination, and keep in mind, I was really, really very high.

59
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:19,840
I went and I got some rocks from my driveway,

60
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:25,120
and I started throwing them in the direction of the possums in the tree in my neighbor's yard.

61
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:26,640
Did you make contact?

62
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:29,360
I was throwing rocks. I would rather not say. I would rather,

63
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:34,400
if there are people who are super hardcore PETA folks,

64
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:39,360
I would rather not divulge whether or not I hit on target,

65
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:42,000
because you know what? It was dark. I may have or may not have.

66
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:46,320
Griffin has decided that since his body is slowly decomposing,

67
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:52,640
he might as well go full old man. Just full, weird, cantankerous old man,

68
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:54,480
throwing rocks at mammals.

69
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:57,200
In my neighbor's yard. Yeah. They may have been pet possums.

70
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:58,560
I don't know. This is fucking Austin.

71
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:03,520
Griffin, you've got to complete this picture by going over to the neighbor's house

72
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:05,600
and complaining to them about their possums.

73
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:06,000
Yeah.

74
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:10,000
630. Listen, just wanted to let you know I took care of the possums for you.

75
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,760
Hold on. And then I diarrhea on my bare, grody feet.

76
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:18,320
Also, I made you some raspberry preserves.

77
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:22,400
Is this the right thing to do though? Because what am I going to do?

78
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:24,560
Go get my cat? Nope. Because look up.

79
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:25,840
Did you try using your words?

80
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:30,640
I did. You know what the words I said were? This was great.

81
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:32,480
I walked out and I saw the possum in the tree and I said,

82
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:35,200
oh no, out loud to myself.

83
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:39,200
And then I didn't see the second possum until a couple minutes later,

84
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:41,120
because I saw the other possum hissing upwards.

85
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:43,200
I was like, what's he hissing? Oh, the second possum.

86
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:46,160
And I actually said, oh my God. And I turned around and went back in the house.

87
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:50,720
It snowed real bad here on Valentine's Day proper.

88
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:54,560
And like, I got into a minor car accident when my car slid into a curb,

89
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:57,280
but I slid for like 20, 30 feet.

90
00:06:57,280 --> 00:07:00,320
So it was like a really long 20 mile an hour slide.

91
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:03,360
And the whole time I was sitting there going, oh my, oh my goodness.

92
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:07,120
Oh, oh gosh. Oh, oh gosh. Oh my gosh.

93
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:11,440
When you're in the zone, anything can happen, man.

94
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:14,880
So isn't it weird how when you,

95
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:17,760
and maybe this isn't the same thing in every part of the country.

96
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:21,040
In fact, I'm most certain it's not, but like growing up in West Virginia,

97
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:23,280
we have squirrels, a lot of squirrels everywhere.

98
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:26,880
Don't see as many of them as you used to. Thanks Al Gore.

99
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:31,920
Al Gore ground down squirrels to turn them into internet.

100
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:33,920
He killed them with global warming.

101
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:40,400
Anyway, it's weird how if I see a squirrel, it's basically like, well, there's a squirrel.

102
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:46,720
If an animal is 20% bigger, suddenly I'm in fucking wild kingdom.

103
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:52,640
Like I feel like I'm having a grizzly man style encounter with a wild animal.

104
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:53,360
And I get terrified.

105
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:54,960
They're just ferrets with weirder tails.

106
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:57,600
But like, I don't, I just don't want to look at them.

107
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:01,120
I just always assume that the possum is looking at me going,

108
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:02,960
which one of us isn't supposed to be here?

109
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:05,280
Not infringing on my land.

110
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:09,360
Yeah. If it's in my house, it knows that it's in the wrong.

111
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:12,720
But when we're outside, it's a toss up.

112
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:14,960
Yeah, it's nocturnal.

113
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:16,400
Let's, let's start.

114
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:17,280
I feel selfish.

115
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:19,280
Like I've just been like, I just needed to vent.

116
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:21,200
Cause like I had a pretty bad two days there.

117
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:24,880
Two of my three ailments have cleared up by the way.

118
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:26,800
Sounds like your butt's been doing plenty of venting.

119
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:31,120
And my face and my fucking.

120
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:32,720
Every hole.

121
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:35,520
At just every hole, including the new ones on my feet.

122
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:39,840
How do you like podcasts?

123
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:42,720
This is what podcasts are.

124
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:44,080
How do you feel right now?

125
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:47,040
This is a journey you've taken yourself on.

126
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:48,560
Let's answer some questions.

127
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:52,800
I'm a guy in my mid twenties and I got a haircut the other day.

128
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:59,120
The barber had me turn sort of, it's an evening recording folks.

129
00:08:59,120 --> 00:08:59,920
We're not used to this.

130
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:01,280
So things may get a little rippled.

131
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:02,640
I apologize in advance.

132
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:05,520
The barber had me turn sort of sideways first, the haircut.

133
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:08,400
And I didn't want to turn my head while he was working.

134
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:09,920
That's how you lose an ear.

135
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:11,360
And lose my attention.

136
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:17,760
Ironically, when he was done, he turned me back to the mirror and asked what I thought.

137
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:20,080
Turns out he had cut it way shorter than I wanted.

138
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:22,720
Obviously I was polite and thanked him and tipped him.

139
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:25,200
But is there really anything you could do in this situation?

140
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:27,920
Yeah, like wait 30 days.

141
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:28,800
Next question.

142
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:33,040
Like, I guess get a weave?

143
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:34,160
What do you want us to tell you?

144
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:35,520
This is fucking physics.

145
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:38,640
I don't think, okay wait.

146
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:43,440
I don't think he's asking was there anything I could have done to replace the hair.

147
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:48,080
I think they're asking is there anything I could have done to tell the dude he did a shit job.

148
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:54,800
I mean, your problem was going more than 15 seconds where you didn't look, didn't like

149
00:09:54,800 --> 00:10:00,800
fucking fact check the spin job that somebody was doing to your dome while you're getting

150
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:01,440
a haircut.

151
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:04,160
You have to keep a constant eye on it.

152
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:07,360
That's why it's rough as a bespectacled man, though.

153
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:12,240
Because when they make me take off my glasses to get my hair cut, it's like I'm squitting

154
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:12,960
so hard.

155
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:14,000
Hey Travis, 1-800-CONTACTS.

156
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:20,800
I found my hairdressers hate me because when I say hairdressers, I go to Mastercuts.

157
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:21,440
The people that work at Mastercuts hate me.

158
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:23,520
Are you still going to Mastercuts?

159
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:25,520
My team was stylists.

160
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:26,720
My team was stylists.

161
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:33,920
When I go to see a stylist at Mastercuts, what I tell them is that, and that's not to

162
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:35,680
disparage people who work at Mastercuts.

163
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:37,520
I thought Sunny was at Fantastic Sam's.

164
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:39,840
No, Sunny's not at Fantastic Sam's.

165
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:44,400
And I don't go there because Fantastic Sam's has a hole that kids can put their hair in

166
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:45,520
and it turns into a toy.

167
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:49,280
That kind of alchemy is devil worship.

168
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:55,200
At the risk of running into a trademark violation, home, you don't play that.

169
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:55,840
So anyway.

170
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:59,520
You could take that toy home and like cherish it, but you know it's hair.

171
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:02,880
You know it's a hair toy.

172
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:04,880
This is a real, that's going to sound really bizarre.

173
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:05,600
I'm serious.

174
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:06,800
That's the way this thing works.

175
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:07,760
You put in some of your hair.

176
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:13,600
And then a fucking adult like replaces it, like knocks a toy down from the top of it

177
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:17,520
and you don't, sorry Travis, I don't want to go behind the candelabra here, but you know

178
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:19,200
it's not like an actual magic thing.

179
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:21,360
An adult switches the hair for a toy.

180
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:21,860
Griffin.

181
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:28,480
I don't, Justin, I don't want to shatter the illusion, but you're a fucking 38 year

182
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:29,120
old man.

183
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:32,720
How old do you think our brother is?

184
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:34,400
This makes a lot of sense in retrospect.

185
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:41,760
What I do is I tell the hairstylist that they ask what you want, which I used to say like

186
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:43,680
what do you think I should do?

187
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:45,200
Because I was just so lost.

188
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:48,400
But now I tell them just to clean up.

189
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:50,720
You know, just clean it up so it looks intentional.

190
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:57,120
And then once they do that, then I say clean it up a bit more and you just stair step them

191
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:57,840
back from that.

192
00:11:57,840 --> 00:11:58,880
I bet they love you.

193
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:01,600
Your haircuts take four and a half hours.

194
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:02,160
I know I said-

195
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:03,360
Here's some legit advice.

196
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:03,600
Okay.

197
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:07,200
Your clippers, right, they have guards on them.

198
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:10,960
The different guards have different numbers that dictate the length that it will cut your

199
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:11,600
hair.

200
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:13,600
Memorize the length you want.

201
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:16,080
When you go for a haircut and they say, what do you want?

202
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:20,080
Say, I'd like the sides at a number three and the top at a number five.

203
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:20,640
A number three?

204
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:22,560
What's the fucking point if you do a number three?

205
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:27,680
Well, number three, it trims it up so you don't get, well, I get a little bit curl

206
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:29,040
past three on the sides.

207
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:29,280
Okay.

208
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:33,120
But that just cleans it up and then the five leaves enough to style it.

209
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:33,440
I see.

210
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:34,800
I go six all over.

211
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:36,320
You do six all over?

212
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:44,160
After they have already messed up your hair though, I think you did the exact right thing

213
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:55,040
because you've got to instantly make the mental leap that you like it because you have nothing

214
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:55,680
else.

215
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:57,920
There's no other options for you.

216
00:12:57,920 --> 00:13:01,680
So telling the person that you did a good job and tipping them is an essential part

217
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:04,160
of make it because why would you ever be doing that if I didn't like it?

218
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:04,960
You have to like it.

219
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:05,840
You have to own it.

220
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:09,840
I think it's time for us to start bringing the male weave back into fashion.

221
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:11,680
I love a male weave.

222
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:13,280
I would love a male weave.

223
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:22,640
Not all the time because like I live in Texas, so like all of my haircuts are by necessity

224
00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:25,280
just like extremely short for survival sake.

225
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:29,280
But back in the day, I would get some pretty bad.

226
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:36,480
When I kicked it at the Happy Hair Boutique, when my non-regular stylist was working,

227
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:41,040
she would do some pretty whack birds nest shit up there.

228
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:45,840
And man, I would have appreciated some extensions back then when I was coming up.

229
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:48,560
So we hope that helps.

230
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:50,480
You're stuck with it.

231
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:51,200
See you in 30 days.

232
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:52,080
You're stuck with it.

233
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:52,880
Learn to like it.

234
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:57,280
Next time, you're just looking for a cleanup.

235
00:13:57,280 --> 00:13:59,360
You just want to clean it up and then clean it up more.

236
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:04,640
Keep your third eye fucking open and watch what they're doing because they'll fuck you.

237
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:08,000
They'll fuck you and then like you might say like you did a bad job.

238
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:11,600
But as soon as you walk out the door, they're going to forget all about the bad job they did

239
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:13,520
and they'll continue terrorizing people.

240
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:14,400
Do you guys want a Yahoo?

241
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:17,360
Yahoo is sent in by Drew Davenport.

242
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:18,240
Thanks, Drew Davenport.

243
00:14:19,280 --> 00:14:22,640
I'm about ready to upgrade Drew Davenport to like platinum status.

244
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:27,040
He's about to become a triple emerald member.

245
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:28,560
He's got his 10th stamp.

246
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:30,000
So his 11th one is free.

247
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:31,760
His 11th stamp.

248
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:33,920
The stamps don't mean anything, but here's a free one.

249
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:35,280
Thank you, Drew.

250
00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:38,240
It's by Yahoo Answers user Walt who asks,

251
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:44,720
what do you think of country singer Toby Keith's new restaurant not allowing guns?

252
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:52,800
From news article, country star actor and restaurateur Toby Keith,

253
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:54,640
I'll give you one of those,

254
00:14:56,320 --> 00:15:00,320
has sparked a controversy after banning guns from his newly opened eatery in Virginia.

255
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:05,200
The 52 year old Oklahoma native had a grand opening last week for his newest venture,

256
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:10,560
Toby Keith's I love this bar and grill in the DC suburb of Woodbridge.

257
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:13,680
But many of the singer's fans who turned up for the event

258
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:17,280
were shocked to discover a sign in the window that announced no guns permitted.

259
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:20,400
Maybe Toby Keith, this is that was from the article.

260
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:22,000
This is Yahoo Fresh.

261
00:15:22,640 --> 00:15:25,360
Maybe Toby Keith supports guns, but not in his restaurants,

262
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:27,280
or maybe he doesn't have control over it.

263
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:30,800
Yes.

264
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:33,360
Toby Keith done lost control of his fucking restaurant.

265
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:38,000
But listen, we can all agree that like it's a sovereign earth kind of thing.

266
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,720
When you start into a Toby Keith I love this bar and grill,

267
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:44,560
you've left American soil and you're in the land of Toby Keith America.

268
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:44,880
Okay.

269
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:48,880
And if you're saying if they didn't prohibit guns explicitly on the front door,

270
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:51,840
it would be like a fucking unreal tournament in there.

271
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:54,240
People just like as soon as they cross the threshold, just like,

272
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:54,960
give me a steak.

273
00:15:57,360 --> 00:15:58,960
Give me a steak and some peanuts.

274
00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:03,120
Real talk.

275
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:06,480
Have either of you ever been in a Toby Keith I love this bar and grill?

276
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:09,920
I remember when Travis went in one, we were in a Cincinnati Reds game.

277
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:10,640
Is this real?

278
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:12,800
This is real.

279
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:14,960
We were in a Cincinnati Reds game, Travis disappeared.

280
00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:17,360
And when we relocated him,

281
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:22,240
he informed us that he had just ventured into Toby Keith's I love this bar and grill.

282
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:24,960
It was part of my like year of new things.

283
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:28,960
And one day my new thing was I was going to go into a Toby Keith I love this bar and grill.

284
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:30,000
And it was horrifying.

285
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,440
And so many-

286
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:37,360
Little did he know it would end in tragedy as gunplay broke out for the 38th consecutive day.

287
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:40,640
There's no law like that at Cincinnati Toby Keith's I love this bar and grill.

288
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:41,840
That's just the law West.

289
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:45,200
I was wondering why you guys didn't react strongly to the name.

290
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:46,800
And I guess you were fucking-

291
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:49,840
Yeah, we're pretty, we're pretty, Travis is pretty well inundated.

292
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:53,680
Do you think Toby Keith strode in there just all angry?

293
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:56,000
I specifically said guns-

294
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:56,400
Required.

295
00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:57,040
Guns demanded.

296
00:16:57,040 --> 00:16:57,680
Guns mandatory.

297
00:16:57,680 --> 00:16:58,640
You have to have a gun.

298
00:17:04,080 --> 00:17:06,640
I think he's making a pretty big statement here.

299
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:15,040
And I've been, I've been wavering on like Toby Keith's constitutional stick-to-it-iveness

300
00:17:16,080 --> 00:17:17,920
for lack of a better term for a while now.

301
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:20,000
I think, here's what I think.

302
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,800
I'm just going to go down the list of just the things I think, okay?

303
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:26,080
Uh, the whole Dixie Chicks flare up was a false flag.

304
00:17:26,080 --> 00:17:27,440
Just from, just from the start.

305
00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:29,120
That's just how I feel.

306
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:30,560
That's just what I believe.

307
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:35,280
Beer for my horses was also a false flag.

308
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:39,520
Whiskey for my men, beer for my horses.

309
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:40,480
That's a good tune.

310
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:41,520
Yeah, that's a movie.

311
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:45,760
Hold on, but wait, sing, sing the lyrics of that song.

312
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:48,400
Sing the lyrics of that song backwards though.

313
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:51,920
Start playing, uh, Wizard of Oz.

314
00:17:51,920 --> 00:18:00,320
Uh, maybe Toby Keith just wants, doesn't want to be challenged if he decides to go in with a gun.

315
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:04,960
Because you know how it is when you go to a place with a gun and you see somebody else has a gun

316
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:08,320
and then it's like, well, I guess we have to shoot contest.

317
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:14,080
And now we have to fight and shoot each other and he just, and maybe times might get tough

318
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:19,440
and he needs to know there's at least one place he can safely hold up a gun point and rob blind.

319
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:23,840
I would like to know, like, I just think it would be great

320
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:29,200
if the other half of that was like guns prohibited, rapiers encouraged.

321
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:29,360
Yeah.

322
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:32,480
I'm sorry miss, I'm sorry.

323
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:36,000
I specifically asked for no chives on my Tato skins.

324
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:38,880
Um, I demand satisfaction.

325
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:39,280
Shing!

326
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:40,960
Um, I guess my-

327
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:42,400
I meant to sweet up that man.

328
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:45,760
Hell yeah.

329
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:49,840
My question is if you, without a gun, how are you supposed to eat pork chops?

330
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,600
And really enjoy them.

331
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:56,880
You may eat pork chops, but you don't taste pork chops unless you're packing meat.

332
00:18:56,880 --> 00:19:00,960
This is you, knife, fork, cut, cut, cut, cut, dip, maybe you dip in an A1.

333
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:02,720
Good.

334
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:07,760
Um, the best way to do it is gun, bullet, bullet, bullet, you load them in a gun

335
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:10,800
and then you shoot the bot, you shoot, if you can shoot the lip of the plate,

336
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:13,680
the pork chops on and fling it in the air, it's going to save you a few bullets.

337
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:16,960
And then you just sort of juggle it up there and then it lands in your mouth.

338
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:21,600
Ultimately, another good thing to do is to jam as much of the pork chop into

339
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:26,320
the barrel of the gun as you can and then just take this express train-

340
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:31,440
Let me tell you, you are going to need a long barreled, maybe a revolver.

341
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:32,400
Here's the thing.

342
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:37,760
You want just enough stopping power, but not too much stopping power.

343
00:19:38,560 --> 00:19:42,080
I recently dropped a small fortune on a beautiful designer purse.

344
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:46,480
The problem is I frequently get asked the question, how much did you pay for it?

345
00:19:47,040 --> 00:19:51,120
Did you guys have any subtle ways of sidestepping this question?

346
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:54,960
That's from, I'd rather not say in New Brunswick, Canada.

347
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:56,400
Well, you've come to the right place.

348
00:19:57,920 --> 00:19:58,320
I have-

349
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:03,040
When I get asked how much I paid for it, I always say more than it was worth.

350
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:08,480
When I get asked how much I paid for anything, the answer is almost always $9.

351
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:08,980
$9.

352
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:15,840
I try really hard not to own anything that costs much money.

353
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:18,240
What if I fall in-

354
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:21,680
See, I don't try, but I do.

355
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:28,320
I don't try very hard to not own things that cost a lot of money.

356
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:30,240
I just do.

357
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:32,000
I just, that's just what I-

358
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:34,880
I try really hard to have things.

359
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:38,720
It's like that joke, I don't know.

360
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:42,960
Maybe it's just from our background and sort of how we grew up,

361
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:50,880
but I almost don't know where people buy expensive things.

362
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:53,200
I always think that when someone buys an expensive thing,

363
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:55,440
it's because they didn't have a friend with them going, really?

364
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:56,240
Oh no, don't do that.

365
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:56,560
Really?

366
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:57,840
How much?

367
00:20:57,840 --> 00:20:58,480
I'm sorry, what?

368
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:05,120
It's weird because as you get older and you're allowed to go whenever stores you want,

369
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:09,760
you walk into a store and you look at a price tag and it's almost like,

370
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:12,400
wait a minute, this is the wrong store.

371
00:21:13,920 --> 00:21:15,120
I'm not supposed to be here.

372
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:18,480
There's five numbers on this shirt.

373
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:21,040
I'm not supposed to be here.

374
00:21:21,040 --> 00:21:26,160
One of my favorite things to do is to go into fancy boutique clothing emporiums

375
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:29,680
and challenge myself to look at price tags and keep a stone face.

376
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:32,880
Just keep like, I'm still considering this face.

377
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:34,240
Like, how much is this jacket?

378
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:36,160
I still might buy it.

379
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:37,440
I don't know.

380
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:40,080
Wait, I think I already own this jacket in blue.

381
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:40,640
I'm gonna leave.

382
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:46,160
But at the same time, I like to have nice stuff.

383
00:21:46,160 --> 00:21:50,800
And I don't like being talked down to by snooty store employees.

384
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:51,840
Do you remember that one time?

385
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:56,960
I think it was me and you just went to Brothers of the Year,

386
00:21:56,960 --> 00:22:01,360
went to that fucking protein powder store at the mall

387
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:03,760
and we're like, we're gonna get our brother Travis some protein powder.

388
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:07,360
And they're like, this store isn't for you.

389
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:11,600
The things in this store cost a considerable amount of money.

390
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:18,320
It's for all of Huntington, West Virginia's extremely wealthy health conscious person.

391
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:20,080
It's for Steven.

392
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:21,040
It's for Doug.

393
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:23,120
Welcome to come on in, Doug.

394
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:24,160
We just called it that.

395
00:22:25,040 --> 00:22:25,920
Welcome to Doug's.

396
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:28,080
I love this protein powder.

397
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:34,560
Because you were like, I guess you wanted to get beefy, I guess.

398
00:22:34,560 --> 00:22:36,880
Maybe this was that summer we had their weight fence

399
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:41,120
that we found outside of a dollar tree in a dumpster.

400
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:47,360
I just wish I could be there on the day that you,

401
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:49,520
young Griffin and young Justin went.

402
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:51,520
I know what Travis wants.

403
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:53,680
I remember we walked out of that store so incensed

404
00:22:53,680 --> 00:22:57,040
because and then we had all these conversations in our brain

405
00:22:57,040 --> 00:22:59,920
that we should have had with the come on in, Doug manager.

406
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:00,800
Like, oh, yeah?

407
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:03,920
Well, how about this money that I raised working at Blockbuster?

408
00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:05,520
$62.

409
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:07,760
And the guy's like, yeah, like, yeah.

410
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:10,320
Like, yeah, that's exactly what I'm talking about, little kid.

411
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:12,560
Do you have a baggie?

412
00:23:12,560 --> 00:23:13,920
I can put off scoop in.

413
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:18,000
I just don't buy nice things, I guess, is what we're saying.

414
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,120
I know that's a bad answer.

415
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:21,680
But for the money you spend on that one nice thing,

416
00:23:21,680 --> 00:23:23,280
you could buy 10 OK things.

417
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:27,760
I guess it's just weird to me that someone would see

418
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:31,760
something you're clearly proud of that you bought for yourself

419
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:33,600
and would ask you how much money you pay.

420
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:36,480
It seems so like unclassy.

421
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:40,000
The nice thing about owning a lot of things

422
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:43,360
that don't cost very much money is you can spend a lot of money

423
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:47,520
is you can always feel free to throw those things at people

424
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:48,400
to make a point.

425
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:51,680
If you have expensive things, you can't do that,

426
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:53,840
unless you're trying to make a point that like,

427
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:56,400
unless the point is about affluence.

428
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:58,400
I love the moment.

429
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:01,280
One of my favorite moments is when I have a sweet jacket,

430
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:03,040
like I bought it at thrift store.

431
00:24:03,040 --> 00:24:04,720
So I'm like, oh, my God, I love your jacket.

432
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:05,440
Where'd you get it?

433
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:07,120
And you get to say something like, you know what?

434
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,600
Paid three bucks for it.

435
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:11,040
And they're like, what?

436
00:24:11,040 --> 00:24:13,920
That seems to me like the other way seems like

437
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:15,280
it's lose, lose.

438
00:24:15,280 --> 00:24:17,200
Like somebody asked how much you pay for that purse

439
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:19,680
and you say like $1,200.

440
00:24:19,680 --> 00:24:22,720
They're either gonna think, wow, that's way too much money

441
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:25,440
to pay for a purse or you got ripped off.

442
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:28,080
I find myself incapable of admitting

443
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:30,080
how much I spend on anything.

444
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:33,040
Like I will almost, and I don't know why I do this.

445
00:24:33,040 --> 00:24:36,480
And maybe it's like, I learned it from not wanting

446
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:38,480
to admit to our parents how much I paid for stuff.

447
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:40,800
But like, and this was with my money.

448
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:42,480
So I don't really know why I was hiding.

449
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:45,200
But whatever I tell people how much something costs,

450
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:49,600
I tend to always put like a 20 to 30% discount on it.

451
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:50,800
And there's no reason.

452
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:51,680
What the fuck are we talking?

453
00:24:51,680 --> 00:24:54,080
Yeah, the answer, obviously lie.

454
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:55,120
Obviously, oh, yeah.

455
00:24:57,520 --> 00:25:00,160
It was 88% off on Amazon lightning deals.

456
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:02,000
And then you throw up the shocker

457
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:05,120
and you make a fucking five minute long uninterrupted

458
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:07,040
fart noise with your mouth until they walk away.

459
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:10,560
When I buy stupid shit, I always get to have a fun game

460
00:25:10,560 --> 00:25:12,720
of how much am I gonna tell Teresa this cost?

461
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:15,600
And it's usually like, honey, it was super clearance.

462
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:19,680
Yeah, Cindy and I took a tour of the Cold War bunker

463
00:25:19,680 --> 00:25:21,120
at the Greenbrier, right?

464
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:24,080
And I got the reservations and they told me

465
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:25,120
how much it was gonna be.

466
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:26,800
It was $30 per person.

467
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:27,440
It's a resort.

468
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:30,080
So everything costs like this dumb amount of money.

469
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:33,600
And when she said, when I was telling her this,

470
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:35,600
she said, wait, you have to pay for it?

471
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:36,880
And I said, yes.

472
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:38,960
And she said, how much was it?

473
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:42,400
And I said, it was like $10 per person.

474
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:44,720
That was it.

475
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:46,880
And later she saw how much it was.

476
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:49,360
I don't know why I felt like I had to lie about it.

477
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:51,920
There was no reason we both wanted to do it.

478
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:55,840
I just, maybe I want to be seen as thrifty, maybe.

479
00:25:55,840 --> 00:25:57,360
That's an image I'm trying to cultivate.

480
00:25:57,360 --> 00:25:58,240
It's a cool image.

481
00:25:59,280 --> 00:26:01,680
Anytime anybody asks anybody else about the price

482
00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:02,800
that they pay for their clothes,

483
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:06,960
is it too much to ask them to grab the other person

484
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:10,480
by the shoulders and hold them completely still

485
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:13,440
while they sing every word of Macklemore's Thrift Shop

486
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:14,080
in their face?

487
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:18,800
Smell like R. Kelly Sheets.

488
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:19,440
Piss.

489
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:22,800
Like please, please, please, please, please let me go.

490
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:23,520
Please let me go.

491
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:26,560
I'm popping and locking to get the Reebok snapping.

492
00:26:26,560 --> 00:26:27,120
Please.

493
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:28,000
I'm so sad.

494
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:28,560
Please.

495
00:26:28,560 --> 00:26:29,360
Piss.

496
00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:31,280
You just sang that one part over and over again.

497
00:26:31,280 --> 00:26:32,400
I think it's the only part you know.

498
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:33,840
Maybe.

499
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:35,120
Smell like R. Kelly Sheets.

500
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:37,120
Piss.

501
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:41,440
I'm five years old.

502
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:43,680
Someone can see me piss 50 times.

503
00:26:43,680 --> 00:26:44,720
I laugh every time.

504
00:26:45,680 --> 00:26:48,080
Especially when you say it like a threatening reptile.

505
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:50,960
Smell like R. Kelly Sheets.

506
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:51,460
Piss.

507
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:53,360
Humans.

508
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:56,960
Look if it sounds like a reptile that should be behind

509
00:26:56,960 --> 00:26:58,240
the Cheshire Cat.

510
00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:00,480
Like the Cheshire Cat's height, man.

511
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:02,880
Just every few sentences he punctuates it with.

512
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:05,520
Yeah, and also piss.

513
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:06,640
That's Ryan Lewis.

514
00:27:07,680 --> 00:27:08,240
Ryan Lewis is a reptile.

515
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:10,000
Mystery revealed.

516
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:10,560
He is a-

517
00:27:10,560 --> 00:27:11,040
Fuck stink.

518
00:27:11,040 --> 00:27:12,000
He's a cerulean.

519
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,080
He has been a cerulean.

520
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:17,040
There's a stink bug on my fucking computer.

521
00:27:17,680 --> 00:27:19,040
What is with your house?

522
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:22,560
It's this warm weather we're having.

523
00:27:22,560 --> 00:27:25,680
They're getting brave because they're making a run for the outside.

524
00:27:25,680 --> 00:27:29,600
The way stink bugs work is they come to your house when they're cold and they just chill.

525
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:30,560
They don't do anything.

526
00:27:30,560 --> 00:27:31,360
Oh, that's horrifying.

527
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:32,160
How can you even-

528
00:27:32,160 --> 00:27:35,280
All they do is chill because they want to stay warm through the winter.

529
00:27:35,280 --> 00:27:37,120
And then when it starts warming up they're like,

530
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:38,000
well, dip.

531
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:39,840
Thanks for letting us stay at your pad.

532
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:43,440
They put on a tiny top hat and they're clean and they get schooled out.

533
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:44,800
Travis, you're thinking of Joe's apartment again.

534
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:45,840
That wasn't a documentary.

535
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:46,560
Oh, sorry.

536
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:47,680
Sorry, you guys.

537
00:27:47,680 --> 00:27:48,160
Hey, listen.

538
00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:54,480
All this talk about expensive things has got me hungry for a smackeral of money.

539
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:55,840
So let's go to the money zone.

540
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:57,040
Why'd you get weird?

541
00:27:58,320 --> 00:27:59,840
I'm rubbing my chest because it is-

542
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:03,840
He just rubbed kissing oil on his mouth and now everything he says is weird.

543
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:07,120
I'm not capable of sounding normal while I'm rubbing my chest.

544
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:08,720
Let's go to the money zone.

545
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:09,520
I don't like this.

546
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:25,680
You've probably tried Hulu.com, but Hulu Plus is better than that.

547
00:28:25,680 --> 00:28:29,440
With Hulu Plus you can watch your favorite shows whenever the hell you want.

548
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:30,720
Because you're a grownup.

549
00:28:31,920 --> 00:28:33,520
Do you want to tell us the shows you watch?

550
00:28:36,160 --> 00:28:37,280
Do you like Jiminy Click?

551
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:39,040
Probably not on there.

552
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:41,680
Do you like Jiminy Kimmel?

553
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:44,960
Jiminy Kimmel's weird brother?

554
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:45,840
Jiminy Kimmel?

555
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:47,200
Do you like snow?

556
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:51,200
You like sharks?

557
00:28:56,720 --> 00:28:58,560
Do you like smoking Percocets?

558
00:28:58,560 --> 00:28:59,520
Because Justin does.

559
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:03,280
And also Scandal.

560
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:04,800
That's actually-

561
00:29:04,800 --> 00:29:06,560
Okay, they got those.

562
00:29:06,560 --> 00:29:08,400
They have archived shows.

563
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:10,720
R. Kelly Sheets.

564
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:11,520
Oh my god.

565
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:14,000
Hey, Hulu Plus.

566
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:14,480
You're welcome.

567
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:17,200
I just want to see if they're listening.

568
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:19,280
You can also check out exclusive content.

569
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:22,560
Can I talk about Lost and Law and Order SVU and Dr. Who and Community?

570
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:23,840
They're great shows that they have on there.

571
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:24,800
Archived.

572
00:29:24,800 --> 00:29:25,280
Check them.

573
00:29:25,280 --> 00:29:25,760
Watch them.

574
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:27,600
And also watch The Wrong Man to Behind the Mask.

575
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:32,720
They're original programs that you can watch right on there.

576
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:34,560
It's like not even a problem.

577
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:37,120
They have ad-free movies.

578
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:38,320
They got kids content.

579
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:40,560
And it is $7.99 a month.

580
00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:42,960
Sorry, not $799.

581
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:46,720
$7.99 a month to-

582
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:47,440
That's too much.

583
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:49,120
I'm not going to pay that for at least two weeks.

584
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:50,560
I don't get paid for two weeks, Griffin.

585
00:29:50,560 --> 00:29:51,760
I can't pay that right now.

586
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:57,920
Well, I guess the bad news is that you are kind of poor.

587
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:01,680
I guess the bad news is that you don't have a lot of money.

588
00:30:01,680 --> 00:30:03,120
And that makes me sad for you because you're my brother.

589
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:05,520
But the good news is that we can give you two weeks free

590
00:30:06,160 --> 00:30:09,440
if you go to HuluPlus.com slash my brother.

591
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:10,080
All one word.

592
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:13,520
And you'll get an extended two-week frial.

593
00:30:14,160 --> 00:30:14,800
Frial?

594
00:30:14,800 --> 00:30:15,600
Yeah, that's right.

595
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:16,960
That's what they call free trials.

596
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:19,200
Frials.

597
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:23,920
Go catch your frial on Hulu.com.

598
00:30:23,920 --> 00:30:28,400
Go watch some TV and enjoy it.

599
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:29,120
Get that frial.

600
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:31,920
Try for two weeks free and then decide if you want to keep it.

601
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:33,520
That's such a good deal.

602
00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:34,320
It's a great deal.

603
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:38,080
Thank you, Hulu, for giving us money to just be-

604
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:40,160
HuluPlus.com slash my brother.

605
00:30:40,160 --> 00:30:40,800
Thank you.

606
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:43,520
Here's another great product that we're perfect to advertise.

607
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:47,520
We may be after Hulu sues us out of house and home

608
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:50,160
for stealing their fucking money for bullshit.

609
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:53,680
Listen, we've all had legal troubles.

610
00:30:53,680 --> 00:30:54,400
All of us.

611
00:30:54,400 --> 00:30:55,920
Sometimes David Comey's busy.

612
00:30:56,560 --> 00:31:01,280
Sometimes David Comey, the lawyer who rocks, is busy.

613
00:31:01,280 --> 00:31:04,800
Because we fucking give him a lot of free airtime here.

614
00:31:04,800 --> 00:31:05,440
I'm a bim-bam.

615
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:08,080
So don't even worry about that quack.

616
00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:09,520
Because we got legal zoom.

617
00:31:09,520 --> 00:31:09,760
It turns you into-

618
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:10,480
That was liable.

619
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:12,240
So now we're definitely going to need legal zoom.

620
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:16,880
Legal zoom is, it makes you a lawyer, basically.

621
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:22,080
You can incorporate or form an LLC with a simple questionnaire.

622
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:26,160
And it's just $99, which seems like to create a business

623
00:31:26,160 --> 00:31:29,760
for yourself that like something you pass on to your children.

624
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:35,600
For $99, you don't want to make a business for your children to have?

625
00:31:36,160 --> 00:31:38,640
Real talk, should we fucking do this?

626
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:40,960
Should we have a business?

627
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:42,000
I think we probably should.

628
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:43,360
I think we probably should have incorporated years ago.

629
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:46,000
We could become my brother, my brother, and me incorporated.

630
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:46,240
Yeah.

631
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:47,680
Or we could just like protect our shit.

632
00:31:47,680 --> 00:31:50,320
So people can't like fucking steal it all the time.

633
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:51,920
These kids incorporated taken.

634
00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:58,640
You can also create a will starting at just $69 or a living trust.

635
00:31:58,640 --> 00:32:03,200
That's like a will for people who refuse to die quickly and easily

636
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:05,600
and get peace of mind and also protection.

637
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:07,840
Now listen, legal zoom is not a law firm,

638
00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:10,800
but they can connect you with a third party attorney

639
00:32:10,800 --> 00:32:13,280
and they can provide you with self-help services.

640
00:32:13,280 --> 00:32:18,160
Which is something I would be interested in because lawyers weird me out.

641
00:32:19,280 --> 00:32:20,400
And I don't like people.

642
00:32:20,400 --> 00:32:23,760
And having just like a person there in between me and a lawyer would be great.

643
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:26,160
I'm supposed to be closing on a house here in a few weeks

644
00:32:26,160 --> 00:32:28,240
and like there will be two to three lawyers in the room

645
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:30,480
and I'm fucking terrified.

646
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:32,640
I might request that one of them be David Comey.

647
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:36,320
I think he's like an accidents guy, but I don't know.

648
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:37,360
Maybe he diversified.

649
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:39,360
You can get more savings.

650
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:44,000
You just type my brother into the referral box at the checkout.

651
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,800
I know this stuff isn't necessarily fun to think about.

652
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:48,000
What, living wills?

653
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:48,640
Are you sure?

654
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:50,080
What?

655
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:51,520
Justin.

656
00:32:51,520 --> 00:32:52,960
You're trying to get your laugh on.

657
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:53,920
I get it.

658
00:32:53,920 --> 00:32:57,200
But right now is the time to make a business or a will.

659
00:32:58,800 --> 00:33:04,000
Make a business and then put in the will that the business goes to your kids

660
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,720
and then figure out what you're going to do in your business

661
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:08,720
because you don't have any special skills or anything.

662
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:15,200
But you do have some help on your legal documents from LegalZoom.com.

663
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:17,280
Remember to use the discount code MYBROTHER at referral.

664
00:33:17,280 --> 00:33:18,080
This might be fun too.

665
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:20,960
This might be like a fun, I'm doing like a little arm dance

666
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:22,400
because I'm so excited about this idea.

667
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:24,480
Like a fun like podcast contest.

668
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:26,240
You know how people do that sometimes?

669
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:26,720
Uh-huh.

670
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:28,320
How crazy can your will be?

671
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:29,440
Name us and your will.

672
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:31,120
Oh, okay.

673
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:32,240
You don't have to leave us like-

674
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:33,360
Like living will.

675
00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:34,560
Think of all the demands you could make.

676
00:33:34,560 --> 00:33:36,240
Don't leave us like a bunch of stuff.

677
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:38,240
Maybe just like your pogs collection or something like that.

678
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:39,440
But like it's like-

679
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:43,040
I want to get a call from a lawyer in like 2080

680
00:33:43,040 --> 00:33:44,400
because none of you are going to die anytime soon.

681
00:33:44,400 --> 00:33:46,160
It's like a podcast, like a postcard.

682
00:33:46,160 --> 00:33:47,840
Like you guys send us postcards and that's great.

683
00:33:47,840 --> 00:33:53,440
But when you send us like tell my bim bam sup and that's in your will,

684
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:56,000
that's like a postcard that you can only send once.

685
00:33:56,640 --> 00:33:59,280
It would be terrific if you could leave in your will like a haunted house

686
00:33:59,280 --> 00:34:00,720
but we have to spend the night there.

687
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:01,520
I love it.

688
00:34:01,520 --> 00:34:02,400
Yes, please.

689
00:34:03,280 --> 00:34:05,440
I just assume that's a real thing and I want that.

690
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:09,840
So I got a message for Tom from Pete and Joe and John.

691
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:12,480
Big things on the Tom front, guys.

692
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:13,440
Here's your Tom update.

693
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:15,120
Do do do do do do do do do.

694
00:34:15,120 --> 00:34:16,160
Tom update.

695
00:34:16,160 --> 00:34:17,920
Tom, this is a commercial for you.

696
00:34:17,920 --> 00:34:20,480
You got a new job, a new beard, and you're running.

697
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:23,200
Fortunately, you're so focused on moving 20 forward

698
00:34:23,200 --> 00:34:26,000
that you forgot to look 20 left and you were hit by IKEA.

699
00:34:27,360 --> 00:34:28,720
It's not funny.

700
00:34:28,720 --> 00:34:29,920
It's not funny.

701
00:34:29,920 --> 00:34:31,760
Hey, it's not funny.

702
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:32,800
Stop laughing.

703
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:34,880
Stop laughing, Tom.

704
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:37,120
So as your leg heals, just know that we love you

705
00:34:37,120 --> 00:34:39,680
and maybe someday we'll get to use the Jumbotron

706
00:34:39,680 --> 00:34:42,480
for something other than broken legs and cancer condolences.

707
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:43,200
Oh boy, oh boy.

708
00:34:43,200 --> 00:34:44,480
Tom, how's your week?

709
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:46,000
Oh man.

710
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:47,040
Tom, I hope you feel better, buddy.

711
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:47,840
Tom, feel better.

712
00:34:47,840 --> 00:34:48,880
At least it was a Kia.

713
00:34:48,880 --> 00:34:51,440
It's like the wimpiest car in the whole world.

714
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:53,200
I drive a Kia.

715
00:34:53,200 --> 00:34:56,160
Got a message for Chris Cook from Devin Cook.

716
00:34:57,120 --> 00:35:00,320
And Devin says, thank you for being an amazing partner.

717
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:01,920
I love you more every day.

718
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:05,920
My question for you, will you be my Valentine?

719
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:08,480
P.S. Happy Valentine's brothers.

720
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:13,040
Also to Chris, totes sorry about the timing.

721
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:15,520
Well, no, we can't apologize for this shit anymore.

722
00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:17,120
What did we tell you?

723
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:18,560
What did we say?

724
00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:21,840
I don't want to get like all hyphy in your face,

725
00:35:21,840 --> 00:35:24,640
but we mean what we say when we say that we're fuck ups.

726
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:29,840
I'm gonna turn a little more positive and say, I like this.

727
00:35:29,840 --> 00:35:34,880
I hope it becomes a trend of people buying money zones

728
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:37,520
and then sneaking in secret messages to us

729
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:40,800
in messages to their loved ones.

730
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:42,240
Happy birthday, dad.

731
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:44,880
Also, Travis, I dig the mustache you're rocking right now.

732
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:45,760
You're doing it great.

733
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:46,960
It is working for you.

734
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:48,080
Also, you're in my will.

735
00:35:49,600 --> 00:35:52,640
I'll leave you my mustache if you leave me your mustache.

736
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:55,760
We're mustache Will brothers.

737
00:35:55,760 --> 00:35:59,120
Uh, so, uh, that's very sweet, Devin and Chris.

738
00:35:59,120 --> 00:36:03,440
And I hope you all have a wonderful Valentine's Day together.

739
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:05,600
It's sort of in love.

740
00:36:05,600 --> 00:36:05,840
What is it?

741
00:36:05,840 --> 00:36:07,360
A happy, I hope you had a great.

742
00:36:07,360 --> 00:36:10,720
Next year, um, have a happy flag day.

743
00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:11,520
You too.

744
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:12,400
I'm Carrie Poppy.

745
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:14,320
I'm Ross Botcher and we make a show.

746
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:15,680
Oh no, Ross and Carrie.

747
00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:21,520
No, we investigate fringe science, spirituality, religious groups, alternative therapies.

748
00:36:21,520 --> 00:36:24,400
We put ourselves through a lot of uncomfortable situations.

749
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:26,000
So that you don't have to.

750
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:27,200
Because really, why would you?

751
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:31,360
For example, I watched a tube be inserted into Ross's anus.

752
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:33,760
That's true, but it sounds terrible out of context.

753
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:36,880
We've tried penis and breast enlargement pills.

754
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:39,280
We spent six months undercover becoming Mormons.

755
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:41,040
We hung out with the 9-11 truthers.

756
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:42,880
The UFO cult, the Raelians.

757
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:43,760
And we're going to do more.

758
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:46,320
It's one of the newest shows on Maximumfun.org.

759
00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:51,360
Here's a yahoo.

760
00:36:51,360 --> 00:36:52,880
Uh, hit me.

761
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:53,360
I'm ready.

762
00:36:53,360 --> 00:36:55,200
This yahoo was sent in by Elliot Nevels.

763
00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:56,000
Thanks, Elliot.

764
00:36:56,000 --> 00:37:04,720
It's by yahoo answers user saving hope who asks, can I adopt an 18-year-old if I'm 18 years old?

765
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:09,280
Wait.

766
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:13,200
Can I adopt an 18-year-old if I'm 18-year-old?

767
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:17,280
I'm rich and want a best friend who's in my care.

768
00:37:18,160 --> 00:37:20,080
I have, I have a fiancee?

769
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:21,600
It's in question.

770
00:37:21,600 --> 00:37:25,920
It's in question, so I think they do have a fiancee and they're just-

771
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:27,200
Still waiting on an answer.

772
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:29,360
No, I think they're just wondering if that sweetens the pot.

773
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:36,000
It's hard out there for a single parent of a teenager and also the single parent is a teenager.

774
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:38,720
If they have a fiancee that might, you know, fucking grease the wheels.

775
00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:40,880
It's a fucking shame how this system works.

776
00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:41,760
It's so corrupt.

777
00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:44,000
You got to grease the wheel somewhere.

778
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:48,240
It's a very greasy system, but I think having a fiancee might help this along.

779
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:53,120
I hope they, I hope they trademark this Yahoo answer before Seth Rogen and James Franco listen

780
00:37:53,120 --> 00:37:56,320
to our podcast because if not, this is their next film.

781
00:37:56,320 --> 00:37:57,200
I don't think-

782
00:37:59,120 --> 00:38:00,640
You said you wanted to adopt a kid.

783
00:38:00,640 --> 00:38:02,880
It turned out all we had was this 40-year-old man.

784
00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:04,800
Also, you're 18.

785
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:06,960
It's the new hit comedy.

786
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:07,680
Who's the dad?

787
00:38:11,120 --> 00:38:13,520
Can an 18-year-old adopt an 18-year-old?

788
00:38:13,520 --> 00:38:14,320
I don't think so.

789
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:16,080
Is that 18-year-old rich or poor?

790
00:38:16,080 --> 00:38:18,160
Can you adopt an 18-year-old at all?

791
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:21,600
I mean, this is basically the plot of the OC, right?

792
00:38:21,600 --> 00:38:25,040
Peter Gallagher is much, much, Peter Gallagher is fucking Nosferatu.

793
00:38:25,040 --> 00:38:28,160
I thought, I thought Seth adopted Ryan.

794
00:38:28,160 --> 00:38:29,440
No, no, no.

795
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:29,920
He didn't.

796
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:31,440
Stop trying to spread these falsehoods.

797
00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:34,640
I'm almost positive Seth did.

798
00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:41,520
Please do not besmirch the amazing act of love and faith that Sandy and Kirsten Cohen

799
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:43,600
made in adopting Ryan Atwood.

800
00:38:43,600 --> 00:38:45,440
I won't have it on this podcast.

801
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:47,760
There's, well, we could joke about a lot of things here.

802
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:49,120
I'm sorry, I crossed the line.

803
00:38:49,120 --> 00:38:54,240
I can't, can we reframe this to make it an actual thinker?

804
00:38:54,240 --> 00:38:54,800
Can we do what?

805
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:55,680
Can we reframe this?

806
00:38:56,560 --> 00:38:57,120
Okay.

807
00:38:57,120 --> 00:38:59,360
Can an 18-year-old adopt a 17-year-old?

808
00:39:00,160 --> 00:39:04,400
Because I don't think an 18-year-old, I'm almost certain an 18-year-old can't adopt

809
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:05,200
an 18-year-old.

810
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:09,040
I think a 17-year-old, I think you might have a case there.

811
00:39:10,160 --> 00:39:12,400
How hard is it to adopt somebody?

812
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:13,280
Pretty fucking easy.

813
00:39:14,240 --> 00:39:14,560
Yeah.

814
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:15,840
It's just, you just ask them.

815
00:39:15,840 --> 00:39:20,320
If they say yes, you can catch them under the maypole with a sugar lasso.

816
00:39:23,120 --> 00:39:24,480
That's the way it works.

817
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:28,480
And then on Sadie Hawkins Day, all the 17-year-olds chase the 18-year-olds,

818
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:30,400
whichever ones they touch, adopt them.

819
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:30,720
Yeah.

820
00:39:30,720 --> 00:39:34,160
I gigged this frog and spun around three times and now you're my kid.

821
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:36,640
And also this frog's my kid.

822
00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:39,760
I sure do have a lot to learn about this crazy country of ours.

823
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:44,240
That's how it works in Meepos, you see.

824
00:39:44,240 --> 00:39:46,080
So Valky was confused.

825
00:39:46,080 --> 00:39:54,320
I don't think the adoption authorities would give the stamp on this particular plan.

826
00:39:54,320 --> 00:39:55,920
Have you thought about legal Zoom?

827
00:39:59,520 --> 00:40:01,360
18-year-old looking to adopt a 17-year-old?

828
00:40:01,360 --> 00:40:01,920
Yeah, that sounds good.

829
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:03,120
Yeah, I will do that.

830
00:40:03,680 --> 00:40:05,600
Don't forget my brother, coupon code.

831
00:40:06,560 --> 00:40:07,120
I'm Brad.

832
00:40:07,120 --> 00:40:08,080
This is my boy, Chad.

833
00:40:08,080 --> 00:40:10,000
Hey, what's up?

834
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:11,120
His dad's kind of a dick.

835
00:40:13,520 --> 00:40:15,760
You want him to go to the Stone Temple Pilots concert?

836
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:17,680
And I couldn't think of a better-

837
00:40:17,680 --> 00:40:20,000
Wowsers, Bowser's, Stone Temple Pilots.

838
00:40:20,560 --> 00:40:21,760
Cool, cool, cool, cool, cool.

839
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:23,920
Yeah, his dad's kind of a dick.

840
00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:27,440
Listen, I reached one pocket and I came out with Stone Temple Pilots.

841
00:40:27,440 --> 00:40:28,240
I just got a place.

842
00:40:28,240 --> 00:40:31,760
It's a one bed behind the Citgo, but I don't know.

843
00:40:31,760 --> 00:40:33,040
I think I'd be a pretty cool dad.

844
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:36,880
I know I'm just a lunch lady.

845
00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:38,480
But we really want to go to warp tour.

846
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:45,360
I got another question for you.

847
00:40:45,360 --> 00:40:46,400
Love this idea, though.

848
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:49,120
Please do this thing and then call me and let me know how it worked.

849
00:40:49,840 --> 00:40:50,800
That's how it goes.

850
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:52,000
Don't forget to use legal Zoom.

851
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:55,520
I'm turning 30 soon and I'm having a party.

852
00:40:57,040 --> 00:40:58,400
It was going to be a joint party.

853
00:40:58,400 --> 00:41:00,720
Mmm, weed smoking.

854
00:41:02,240 --> 00:41:06,720
With my roommate since he turns 30 four days later.

855
00:41:06,720 --> 00:41:07,520
At 430.

856
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:08,960
What's up?

857
00:41:13,120 --> 00:41:13,840
That's nothing.

858
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:19,120
It's that one of my friends is my roommate's ex.

859
00:41:19,120 --> 00:41:21,840
They can't be in the same room as each other without a scene.

860
00:41:21,840 --> 00:41:25,360
It'll be especially bad if my roommate brings his newly pregnant fiancee.

861
00:41:27,360 --> 00:41:28,640
I'm getting confused, guys.

862
00:41:28,640 --> 00:41:29,280
Help me.

863
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:29,840
Okay, you ready?

864
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:32,400
If I ask my friend not to come, she'll be devastated.

865
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:33,360
What do I do?

866
00:41:33,360 --> 00:41:36,560
Should I have the party for myself and keep my roommate away?

867
00:41:36,560 --> 00:41:38,000
Or tell my friend not to come?

868
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:39,440
Please help.

869
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:41,440
That's from It Still Feels Like High School at 30.

870
00:41:41,440 --> 00:41:45,360
I don't know if it's that we're getting better at this or the questions are getting easier.

871
00:41:45,360 --> 00:41:46,400
This is so easy.

872
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:46,960
Quick, draw it.

873
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:52,240
Tell your friend not to come because you live with your fucking roommate and it's his house.

874
00:41:52,240 --> 00:41:53,120
And his birthday.

875
00:41:53,840 --> 00:41:54,960
And his birthday.

876
00:41:54,960 --> 00:41:56,800
Your friend will be devastated.

877
00:41:56,800 --> 00:41:58,640
That's the thing that's the craziest in this quest.

878
00:41:58,640 --> 00:42:01,680
I get there being some drama, I mean.

879
00:42:01,680 --> 00:42:02,640
I fucking get it.

880
00:42:02,640 --> 00:42:06,000
Like, it exists in every friend group that's big enough that's been around long enough.

881
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:06,720
I fucking get it.

882
00:42:06,720 --> 00:42:09,760
But, like, I can't come to this one party.

883
00:42:10,320 --> 00:42:14,560
Can't you just say to your friend, like, hey, listen, it's his birthday and it'll make things

884
00:42:14,560 --> 00:42:15,360
awkward.

885
00:42:15,360 --> 00:42:20,000
We can, like, have lunch sometime, but I just don't think it's a good idea for you to come.

886
00:42:21,120 --> 00:42:23,440
Or let me hit you with this.

887
00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:25,200
Two parties.

888
00:42:25,200 --> 00:42:26,480
Costume party.

889
00:42:26,480 --> 00:42:27,440
Everybody wears masks.

890
00:42:27,440 --> 00:42:29,040
That's so much better than two parties.

891
00:42:29,600 --> 00:42:30,560
Everybody wears a mask.

892
00:42:30,560 --> 00:42:31,440
Nobody's allowed to talk.

893
00:42:31,440 --> 00:42:34,080
Sit in silence and stare at each other and smoke that herb.

894
00:42:34,080 --> 00:42:35,120
Smoke that sweet herb.

895
00:42:35,120 --> 00:42:36,640
Don't give it to the pregnant lady.

896
00:42:36,640 --> 00:42:38,000
What are you doing?

897
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:38,560
I don't...

898
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:41,280
There's nothing you can do.

899
00:42:41,280 --> 00:42:47,360
Like, once you have this shit in your group, the only thing you can do is fucking select

900
00:42:47,360 --> 00:42:49,040
who gets to go to what, right?

901
00:42:49,040 --> 00:42:52,240
Or just tell both of them and then they can decide for themselves.

902
00:42:52,240 --> 00:42:55,760
The fact of the matter is, is, like, the next day...

903
00:42:55,760 --> 00:43:01,920
Okay, one, are you really gonna tell your roommate who it was going to be a joint birthday

904
00:43:01,920 --> 00:43:04,240
celebration with, like, hey, you can't come?

905
00:43:04,240 --> 00:43:05,040
That's crazy.

906
00:43:05,040 --> 00:43:07,760
So, instead, I've invited your ex-girlfriend.

907
00:43:07,760 --> 00:43:09,280
That's completely out of your hands.

908
00:43:09,840 --> 00:43:10,720
This is the thing, though.

909
00:43:10,720 --> 00:43:18,000
Like, I think when people decide to leave a relationship in a point that it's this sort

910
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:23,280
of strained and cantankerous, like, they have to accept that they're gonna miss out on some

911
00:43:23,280 --> 00:43:23,520
stuff.

912
00:43:23,520 --> 00:43:25,120
I mean, this is why you decide to squash-

913
00:43:25,120 --> 00:43:27,040
And you have to side with the person you live with.

914
00:43:27,760 --> 00:43:29,680
Yeah, this is why you decide to squash beeps.

915
00:43:29,680 --> 00:43:36,320
Like, your friend has to understand that, like, I mean, it's part of the risk of getting

916
00:43:36,320 --> 00:43:37,520
together and breaking up everything.

917
00:43:37,520 --> 00:43:39,040
Like, it's just collateral damage.

918
00:43:39,040 --> 00:43:44,240
But in this case, and they are forcing you to choose by not being cool with each other.

919
00:43:44,240 --> 00:43:45,440
They're forcing you to choose.

920
00:43:45,440 --> 00:43:48,960
And since it's your roommate's house and your roommate's birthday, this is not a tough one.

921
00:43:48,960 --> 00:43:52,640
It's unfortunate, but, like, if your friend cares that much, tell her to squash the beef

922
00:43:52,640 --> 00:43:53,600
with your roommate.

923
00:43:53,600 --> 00:43:58,960
You have to, seriously, let this be a blanket statement for questions like these.

924
00:43:58,960 --> 00:44:00,560
Because it really is the best solution.

925
00:44:01,920 --> 00:44:04,560
Because we've all, like, had to deal with this shit before.

926
00:44:04,560 --> 00:44:10,800
It's not fair for you to spend, like, any time, like, worrying about this and deliberating

927
00:44:10,800 --> 00:44:11,920
who gets to do what.

928
00:44:11,920 --> 00:44:16,880
Like, you're in some sort of fucked up custody battle with, like, people you didn't marry

929
00:44:16,880 --> 00:44:18,160
and aren't related to.

930
00:44:18,160 --> 00:44:19,200
Have you thought about legal zoom?

931
00:44:19,200 --> 00:44:20,400
Have you thought about legal zoom?

932
00:44:20,400 --> 00:44:20,800
A.

933
00:44:20,800 --> 00:44:21,200
B.

934
00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:24,640
If legal zoom doesn't fall through for you, which, like, why do we even have an option?

935
00:44:24,640 --> 00:44:24,800
B.

936
00:44:24,800 --> 00:44:29,680
You need to put the ball in their court, because they're fucking 30 years old, and, like, they

937
00:44:29,680 --> 00:44:32,000
should be adult enough to figure this out on their own.

938
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:37,200
So you say, like, you can either come and be cool, or you cannot come.

939
00:44:37,200 --> 00:44:44,160
Like, it just makes me tired to, like, have to figure out who gets to come to which thing.

940
00:44:44,160 --> 00:44:46,800
Like, let me get out my Garfield calendar.

941
00:44:46,800 --> 00:44:48,000
Oh, nope, it's a Greg day.

942
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:48,000
A.

943
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:50,720
We'll make the decision for you, if that's what you want.

944
00:44:50,720 --> 00:44:51,920
You can put them on the line.

945
00:44:51,920 --> 00:44:52,720
We'll break it to them.

946
00:44:52,720 --> 00:44:54,960
Gentle, but this is the right thing.

947
00:44:54,960 --> 00:44:59,840
Hold on, if I may real quick butt into your life a little bit, your roommate has been

948
00:44:59,840 --> 00:45:03,280
broken up with this person long enough to, like, have a fiance.

949
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:06,720
They need to fucking squash this beef already.

950
00:45:06,720 --> 00:45:08,080
This beef is soiled.

951
00:45:08,080 --> 00:45:08,800
Maybe.

952
00:45:08,800 --> 00:45:10,080
I meant to say spoiled.

953
00:45:10,080 --> 00:45:13,600
Maybe it's a fly-by-night, super fast developing baby embryo.

954
00:45:13,600 --> 00:45:15,200
Oh, one of those super babies.

955
00:45:15,200 --> 00:45:16,880
No, there's nothing that's tied to-

956
00:45:16,880 --> 00:45:18,960
It's an inside, it's an inside, Jack.

957
00:45:18,960 --> 00:45:22,480
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

958
00:45:22,480 --> 00:45:25,120
Nothing starts a fight between exes like Jack.

959
00:45:25,120 --> 00:45:26,160
Did you cheat on me?

960
00:45:26,160 --> 00:45:27,360
She's eight months pregnant.

961
00:45:27,360 --> 00:45:29,120
We've only been broken up for one month.

962
00:45:29,120 --> 00:45:31,280
Nah, babe, babe, babe, babe, babe, babe, baby.

963
00:45:31,280 --> 00:45:32,320
Former baby.

964
00:45:32,320 --> 00:45:33,200
Check it.

965
00:45:33,200 --> 00:45:33,920
Inside Jack.

966
00:45:35,920 --> 00:45:36,240
Check it.

967
00:45:36,240 --> 00:45:37,680
She's got a little Jack in there, trust me.

968
00:45:38,480 --> 00:45:39,520
It's been a Jack attack.

969
00:45:39,520 --> 00:45:40,240
It's a Jack attack.

970
00:45:40,240 --> 00:45:40,640
Did you ever see that-

971
00:45:40,640 --> 00:45:41,120
Jack in the Mood.

972
00:45:41,120 --> 00:45:43,680
You ever see that, you ever see that movie, Jack?

973
00:45:43,680 --> 00:45:44,320
Yeah?

974
00:45:44,320 --> 00:45:46,880
You ever see that movie, Dead Poets Society?

975
00:45:47,440 --> 00:45:48,800
It's a pretty good movie, don't you think?

976
00:45:49,520 --> 00:45:50,880
I'm glad we could talk like this again.

977
00:45:50,880 --> 00:45:51,840
I miss these talks.

978
00:45:51,840 --> 00:45:53,120
I'm glad you could come to this party.

979
00:45:53,120 --> 00:45:54,320
At least you're not being a shithead.

980
00:45:55,600 --> 00:45:56,160
For once.

981
00:45:57,360 --> 00:45:58,400
What that's supposed to mean.

982
00:45:59,120 --> 00:45:59,840
Oh, great.

983
00:45:59,840 --> 00:46:00,720
And then you get-

984
00:46:00,720 --> 00:46:03,280
Hey, speaking of adult parties, this Yahoo was sent in by Evan Quell.

985
00:46:03,280 --> 00:46:03,680
Thanks, Evan.

986
00:46:03,680 --> 00:46:05,840
It's by Yahoo Answers user Trixie Bell, who asks,

987
00:46:07,120 --> 00:46:11,920
would grownups, late 20s and early 30s, enjoy a sleepover pajama party?

988
00:46:12,560 --> 00:46:12,960
Yes.

989
00:46:12,960 --> 00:46:14,640
I'm thinking about hosting one.

990
00:46:14,640 --> 00:46:15,360
That's it.

991
00:46:15,360 --> 00:46:15,760
Yes.

992
00:46:16,960 --> 00:46:17,360
Okay.

993
00:46:17,360 --> 00:46:21,440
Like, this isn't even a funny, I had this thought the other day of like,

994
00:46:21,440 --> 00:46:24,800
why don't we do, like, I have, like, why don't we do this?

995
00:46:24,800 --> 00:46:29,840
I mean, we do, but like, it's not like an on-purpose sleepover most of the time.

996
00:46:29,840 --> 00:46:30,340
Right.

997
00:46:31,040 --> 00:46:31,760
True.

998
00:46:31,760 --> 00:46:35,680
But I've got friends that I enjoy hanging out with and that I would like to have waffles with.

999
00:46:35,680 --> 00:46:36,000
Yeah.

1000
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:39,920
Why can't, like, we have a sleepover and everybody, we, you know, we just hang out?

1001
00:46:40,640 --> 00:46:42,080
Can I tell you the problem with this?

1002
00:46:42,080 --> 00:46:47,840
And I, this has been my problem with every party I've been to since I was 18,

1003
00:46:47,840 --> 00:46:51,440
is that no one will just go to sleep at a decent hour.

1004
00:46:51,440 --> 00:46:57,440
It is impossible to get 20-somethings to just turn off the lights at midnight and get some rest

1005
00:46:57,440 --> 00:47:00,160
so we can all have a great, well-rested day.

1006
00:47:00,160 --> 00:47:02,720
But no one wants to think that far ahead, it's infuriating.

1007
00:47:02,720 --> 00:47:07,440
Let me jump, let me jump back and say, caveat to this, it would have to happen at my house

1008
00:47:07,440 --> 00:47:10,320
and everybody would have to be in a separate room from my bedroom

1009
00:47:10,320 --> 00:47:13,360
so that when it was time for me to go to bed, I could just leave.

1010
00:47:13,360 --> 00:47:16,320
Okay, but you're talking about a hotel at the, that's not a party, Travis, here.

1011
00:47:16,320 --> 00:47:19,520
No, like, they could sleep in my living room when they were ready,

1012
00:47:19,520 --> 00:47:20,720
but they gotta keep it the fuck down so they can go to bed at midnight.

1013
00:47:20,720 --> 00:47:24,800
You're talking about an amateur bed and breakfast, not a party at that point.

1014
00:47:25,520 --> 00:47:26,080
That's true.

1015
00:47:26,880 --> 00:47:28,240
I want to open a bed and breakfast.

1016
00:47:28,240 --> 00:47:31,040
Okay, so let's talk about that, then, and not, let's just, like,

1017
00:47:31,040 --> 00:47:35,600
totally jump ship on this question and talk about your new amateur bed and breakfast.

1018
00:47:35,600 --> 00:47:39,040
Is there any way that in the morning the guests could make breakfast for me?

1019
00:47:39,040 --> 00:47:39,360
Okay.

1020
00:47:40,720 --> 00:47:44,080
Should head over to legalsoon.com, get those documents going.

1021
00:47:44,080 --> 00:47:46,880
I'm telling you, this is the best new partnership.

1022
00:47:46,880 --> 00:47:49,920
And I mean, you also have to think about all the fucking.

1023
00:47:52,080 --> 00:47:53,040
I'm sorry, what?

1024
00:47:53,040 --> 00:47:54,080
Sorry, what?

1025
00:47:54,080 --> 00:47:55,200
Gotta think about the fucking.

1026
00:47:56,160 --> 00:48:01,520
Guys, this party, let's talk about Travis's amateur bed and breakfast party.

1027
00:48:01,520 --> 00:48:03,600
Okay, midnight, lights out, everybody.

1028
00:48:04,160 --> 00:48:05,120
Try to sleep.

1029
00:48:05,120 --> 00:48:08,000
Try to sleep over the sounds of chopping and screwing in the other room.

1030
00:48:10,160 --> 00:48:11,840
Like in a big, writhing pile?

1031
00:48:11,840 --> 00:48:18,640
I'm talking about fucking 20 foot Marshall stacks worth of DBs of gooshin.

1032
00:48:22,480 --> 00:48:24,640
I don't like this bed and breakfast anymore.

1033
00:48:24,640 --> 00:48:27,760
I'm going to file a very negative review on TripAdvisor.

1034
00:48:28,560 --> 00:48:29,360
Unless that's your thing.

1035
00:48:30,080 --> 00:48:31,600
The waffles were great.

1036
00:48:31,600 --> 00:48:32,880
The waffles, excellent.

1037
00:48:32,880 --> 00:48:33,680
The gooshin, not so much.

1038
00:48:33,680 --> 00:48:34,640
Not so terrific.

1039
00:48:34,640 --> 00:48:36,240
Unless we're talking about the gooshin of the syrup.

1040
00:48:36,800 --> 00:48:37,600
That was pretty good.

1041
00:48:37,600 --> 00:48:41,360
But wait, we are not talking about that specific gooshin.

1042
00:48:46,240 --> 00:48:49,840
My girlfriend and I are planning to move from Kentucky to Portland, Oregon.

1043
00:48:49,840 --> 00:48:55,760
However, her grandmother has frequently told us she would like us to stay in Kentucky.

1044
00:48:55,760 --> 00:49:00,000
We are afraid that telling her grandmother will result in some tension and arguments.

1045
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:01,280
The move is still a few months away.

1046
00:49:01,280 --> 00:49:05,200
Should we tell her now and get it over with or wait till the moving truck is packed and

1047
00:49:05,200 --> 00:49:06,480
yell peace out the window?

1048
00:49:06,480 --> 00:49:08,160
That's from feeling sucky in Kentucky.

1049
00:49:11,600 --> 00:49:13,280
How often do you see this grandmother?

1050
00:49:15,200 --> 00:49:15,920
How much longer?

1051
00:49:15,920 --> 00:49:17,920
No, stop it, stop it, stop it.

1052
00:49:17,920 --> 00:49:19,680
No, have you thought about legal zoom?

1053
00:49:19,680 --> 00:49:19,920
Okay.

1054
00:49:22,560 --> 00:49:26,720
I'm just saying, like, if you only see her three times a year, you might be able to fly

1055
00:49:26,720 --> 00:49:28,080
under the radar with this one.

1056
00:49:29,520 --> 00:49:33,360
Are you saying you can just dip and she won't notice?

1057
00:49:33,360 --> 00:49:37,600
I'm saying that, like, if you only see her, like, Memorial Day, Thanksgiving and, like,

1058
00:49:37,600 --> 00:49:41,840
Christmas, you just continue doing that.

1059
00:49:41,840 --> 00:49:44,640
Well, then, the next time you see him, you will have that Portland smell on you.

1060
00:49:45,440 --> 00:49:46,000
That's true.

1061
00:49:46,800 --> 00:49:47,360
And you won't-

1062
00:49:47,360 --> 00:49:48,560
Are you wearing him?

1063
00:49:49,760 --> 00:49:50,800
I've never been to Portland.

1064
00:49:50,800 --> 00:49:52,720
That was a gross stereotype.

1065
00:49:52,720 --> 00:49:53,360
I apologize.

1066
00:49:53,360 --> 00:49:55,920
You guys love coffee and it rains all the time.

1067
00:49:55,920 --> 00:49:56,640
I'm so sorry.

1068
00:49:56,640 --> 00:49:57,600
I can't stop.

1069
00:49:57,600 --> 00:49:58,960
I got Seattle, right?

1070
00:49:58,960 --> 00:49:59,440
What?

1071
00:49:59,440 --> 00:50:00,000
No, no, no.

1072
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:03,920
The place with all the coffee and it's really grungy.

1073
00:50:04,480 --> 00:50:05,360
And Frasier.

1074
00:50:05,360 --> 00:50:06,320
And Space Needle.

1075
00:50:06,320 --> 00:50:07,040
And Bumbershoot.

1076
00:50:07,040 --> 00:50:08,880
Yeah, yeah, you know.

1077
00:50:08,880 --> 00:50:10,320
Twilight, where Twilight was filmed.

1078
00:50:12,400 --> 00:50:13,440
Seahawks.

1079
00:50:13,440 --> 00:50:15,040
Are they not the same place?

1080
00:50:15,920 --> 00:50:17,040
They're an annex.

1081
00:50:18,080 --> 00:50:19,600
They're recently incorporated.

1082
00:50:20,640 --> 00:50:21,200
You gotta-

1083
00:50:21,920 --> 00:50:24,320
Why does your grandmother give a fuck where you live?

1084
00:50:25,280 --> 00:50:27,120
No, no, no, no, no.

1085
00:50:27,120 --> 00:50:31,120
I can assume your grandmother, because I'm assuming you're an adult,

1086
00:50:31,120 --> 00:50:33,280
that your grandmother's older than 12.

1087
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:36,160
Why doesn't she fucking understand that you're an adult?

1088
00:50:36,160 --> 00:50:38,000
You get to make your life decisions.

1089
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:39,840
And you can do what you will.

1090
00:50:40,560 --> 00:50:43,520
If she's not happy for you, she's not really your grandmother.

1091
00:50:43,520 --> 00:50:44,400
You thought about that?

1092
00:50:44,400 --> 00:50:47,840
Hold up, hold up, hold up, hold up, hold up, hold up, hold up.

1093
00:50:47,840 --> 00:50:52,560
The question asker only says that grandmama said she would like them to stay.

1094
00:50:52,560 --> 00:50:58,000
Yeah, because she's being a selfish bitch.

1095
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:01,600
I'm saying grandma's not saying, like, if you move out, you're dead to me.

1096
00:51:01,600 --> 00:51:04,560
She's saying, like, it would be great if I could continue to see you,

1097
00:51:04,560 --> 00:51:06,080
but I understand that you have to live your own life.

1098
00:51:06,080 --> 00:51:08,960
Yeah, that is, thanks for the guilt trip, James.

1099
00:51:09,600 --> 00:51:13,760
Like, fucking let me fly my own freak flag in Portland.

1100
00:51:13,760 --> 00:51:14,800
I completely understand.

1101
00:51:14,800 --> 00:51:16,800
I'm just saying I would like it if you stayed in Kentucky,

1102
00:51:16,800 --> 00:51:17,760
because I like seeing you.

1103
00:51:17,760 --> 00:51:19,440
Yeah, you know what I would appreciate?

1104
00:51:19,440 --> 00:51:20,240
Oh, grandma.

1105
00:51:20,240 --> 00:51:21,280
Oh, thanks for the pie.

1106
00:51:21,280 --> 00:51:23,920
Why don't you get off my jock for like a second?

1107
00:51:27,440 --> 00:51:29,040
Here's something you could try.

1108
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:31,360
Take her with you.

1109
00:51:31,360 --> 00:51:34,240
Now hear me out.

1110
00:51:34,240 --> 00:51:35,600
Against her will, Justin?

1111
00:51:35,600 --> 00:51:36,480
That seems harsh.

1112
00:51:37,520 --> 00:51:40,960
Put her in the back seat, put a blindfold on her,

1113
00:51:40,960 --> 00:51:44,640
give her some Dramamine until she's out, drive to Seattle,

1114
00:51:46,320 --> 00:51:49,520
buy her a house near your house, but not too close.

1115
00:51:49,520 --> 00:51:52,480
Find her a job, because you just bought two houses.

1116
00:51:54,080 --> 00:51:55,120
You're gonna need some income.

1117
00:51:57,440 --> 00:52:00,240
Oh, buy her a house that looks exactly like her house in Kentucky,

1118
00:52:00,240 --> 00:52:01,840
decorated exactly the same way.

1119
00:52:01,840 --> 00:52:04,160
Move all of her friends there, buy them houses too.

1120
00:52:04,160 --> 00:52:05,280
Import some black bears.

1121
00:52:06,640 --> 00:52:10,480
Note that this plan is only viable for Jaden Smith,

1122
00:52:10,480 --> 00:52:12,560
but Jaden, if you're listening.

1123
00:52:13,360 --> 00:52:14,880
Oh, Truman, show it.

1124
00:52:14,880 --> 00:52:16,400
So you're gonna build a tiny-

1125
00:52:16,400 --> 00:52:17,600
Okay, wait, hold on.

1126
00:52:17,600 --> 00:52:18,960
Let me think through the logistics.

1127
00:52:18,960 --> 00:52:21,040
You're gonna have to build a dome, I think around-

1128
00:52:21,040 --> 00:52:27,840
With this fucking woman's Appalachian wisdom and holler smarts,

1129
00:52:27,840 --> 00:52:30,480
you're telling me she wouldn't see through that ruse in a minute?

1130
00:52:31,280 --> 00:52:32,640
Oh yeah, I see.

1131
00:52:32,640 --> 00:52:35,040
You think I just fell off the fucking turnip truck?

1132
00:52:35,040 --> 00:52:37,440
That's a camera, that's a camera, that's a camera.

1133
00:52:39,840 --> 00:52:43,760
The first time that she starts going out to the forage for Crick Muffins,

1134
00:52:43,760 --> 00:52:46,800
and she can't find any, she's gonna know something's going on.

1135
00:52:46,800 --> 00:52:50,000
You're gonna have to make her afraid of water, if I remember correctly.

1136
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:52,400
Let me just look at any grass.

1137
00:52:52,400 --> 00:52:53,360
That's not blue.

1138
00:52:53,360 --> 00:52:54,320
Bye, fuckers.

1139
00:52:55,600 --> 00:52:57,040
Not again, you fucks.

1140
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:00,400
I gotta go to legal zoom and update my documents.

1141
00:53:01,440 --> 00:53:03,920
I'm gonna Milo and Otis this thing all the way home.

1142
00:53:04,480 --> 00:53:06,800
I want an incredible journey my way back to Kentucky.

1143
00:53:06,800 --> 00:53:09,120
I've got spry Appalachian bones.

1144
00:53:09,680 --> 00:53:14,000
Two dogs, a cat, and a grandma make their way majestically across this land.

1145
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:17,280
You'll never guess which one dies.

1146
00:53:17,280 --> 00:53:18,880
What happens next will shock you.

1147
00:53:19,440 --> 00:53:21,280
This has been my brother, my brother, me.

1148
00:53:21,280 --> 00:53:22,000
It's an advice show for you.

1149
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:24,560
These 12 photos will convince you never to move your grandmother.

1150
00:53:24,560 --> 00:53:27,840
Never to kidnap your grandmother and then build a secret television

1151
00:53:27,840 --> 00:53:30,960
installation base around her and make her think she's still in Kentucky,

1152
00:53:30,960 --> 00:53:33,840
but she won't because she's got rural smarts.

1153
00:53:36,400 --> 00:53:38,480
A lot of SEO optimization in that headline.

1154
00:53:40,240 --> 00:53:42,960
Thank you to people tweeting about the show.

1155
00:53:42,960 --> 00:53:46,480
Like Matt, that's a bunch of you, I bet.

1156
00:53:46,480 --> 00:53:47,520

Thank you to those tweeting about the show.

1161
00:54:15,120 --> 00:54:17,280
Thank you for being patient and waiting for it.

1162
00:54:17,280 --> 00:54:19,440
Hope that it was worth it.

1163
00:54:20,720 --> 00:54:21,920
Worth the wait, as they say.

1164
00:54:22,480 --> 00:54:24,400
If it's ever, I don't know.

1165
00:54:25,920 --> 00:54:27,760
And thanks again to LegalZoom.

00:55:05,200 --> 00:55:05,680
I don't know.

1183
00:55:05,680 --> 00:55:06,400
BeagleZoom.

1184
00:55:06,400 --> 00:55:10,640
Yeah, you're going to get fucking taken for everything.

1185
00:55:10,640 --> 00:55:12,640
But here's some pictures of beagles.

1186
00:55:14,160 --> 00:55:16,320
They're God's floppiest mistake.

1187
00:55:18,720 --> 00:55:21,600
I also want to thank John Roderick and the Longwinters for the use of our theme song

And every week, we're lucky enough to be joined by a guest, sometimes a comedian,

1236
00:57:47,520 --> 00:57:52,240
or sometimes just somebody that we like and somebody probably you've never heard of.

1237
00:57:53,200 --> 00:57:54,480
But trust us.

1238

1239
00:57:59,760 --> 00:58:00,800
Do we sound too desperate?
