1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there will know how cool they are for listening.

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:34,000
If you change your mind, I'm the first in line Honey, I'm still free, take a chance on me If you need me, let me know, I'm gonna be around

6
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:44,000
If you got no place to go, when you're feeling down If you're all alone, when the pretty birds have flown

7
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:53,000
The weather outside may indeed be frightful, depending on your location. There's only one thing more frightful than that, and that's ignorance.

8
00:00:53,000 --> 00:01:01,000
So, come sit by the fire of wisdom. The delightful fire of wisdom with my brother, my brother, and me.

9
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:05,000
There's some toastie over here. It's really cracklin' over here.

10
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Crackle, crackle, crackle. Foley, foley, foley. This is my brother, my brother, and me. It's an advice show for the modern era. We record at Fireside every week, whether or not you know that.

11
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
My name is Justin McElroy.

12
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I'm Travis McElroy.

13
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,000
I'm Griffin McElroy.

14
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Put another log on there. It's a toastie show.

15
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:34,000
It's funny to me that you should mention, you know, depending on your location, because just this year I realized that just because it's snowing here doesn't mean it's snowing everywhere in the world.

16
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
This is interesting, Travis.

17
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Whoa, really? This is like a rap and beats level of confession.

18
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Yeah, it really was like, winter here is not winter everywhere else, and I had no idea. I just assumed when it got cold here the entire world was cold, and that's apparently not how the world works.

19
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,000
That's like some middle ages shit.

20
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Yeah, that's about the goddamn dumbest thing I've ever heard.

21
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:06,000
This is my brother, my brother, and my pet canary that somehow gained the ability to talk is the new show.

22
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Let's jump right into the advice.

23
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:23,000
My female friend and I just got drunk at a party the other day, and she began to become a little more touchy-feely than usual, holding my hand, following me around, standing quite close to me, at one point laying down in my lap.

24
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Wait a minute. Is she a puppy?

25
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Yep, that could be.

26
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
I'd just like to know if this means anything.

27
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:33,000
I've heard people express their true feelings when they're under the influence. Is this true?

28
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:42,000
I'd like to know, as I have more than friends' feelings for her, and I'd like to know if this could mean that she does too, confused in Kali.

29
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Is Kali her name?

30
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
It sounds like...

31
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Going well.

32
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:55,000
As far as the whole idea of people expressing their true feelings when they're under the influence, that is true up to a point.

33
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:06,000
As we've used this phrase before, a bell curve, where it's like, truth, truth, truth, truth, drunk, drunk, drunk, drunk, and then it just becomes like, I'm going to give you a million dollars.

34
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,000
They're not really going to give you a million dollars. They're drunk off their ass.

35
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:16,000
And love is one of those emotions that's heightened by affection, you know, when you've been drinking a lot of times.

36
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Especially physicality.

37
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Yeah, right. It becomes like you kind of love everybody.

38
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Also, some people are just sluts.

39
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Yeah.

40
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,000
I mean, dudes can be dude sluts, I'm not being...

41
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Dluts.

42
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
There are plenty of dluts out there.

43
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:41,000
It's just that sometimes when people get drunk, they're not particularly showing you the true love that they harbor for you in their heart of hearts.

44
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:46,000
They're just being kind of slutty, and they feel like they have an excuse to do so because they're drunk.

45
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:52,000
It could be friend feelings heightened by the drunkenness.

46
00:03:52,000 --> 00:04:02,000
And honestly, my advice to you, like the action item that I would tell you is you can't read anything into it.

47
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Not at all. You got to ignore it.

48
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Not pretend like it didn't happen, but you can't be like, ah, check mark, done, I'm in there because you're not.

49
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Now, if she had done this sober, well then yes, holding your hand, laying down your lap.

50
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,000
But drunk, it's just hard to apply the logic there.

51
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Now, it could be worth...

52
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Man, see, I was about to say, ask her, you know, did that mean anything?

53
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
I don't think it's awkward enough.

54
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Yeah, it's like super weird.

55
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
You got to slow play it.

56
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
You got to slow play it.

57
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Because this is how friendships get in weird, you know, half romantic situations.

58
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
You got to protect yourself.

59
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Here's my advice to you.

60
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Get super drunk yourself and then get handsy.

61
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
I like that.

62
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Get reverse handsy.

63
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Maybe don't get super uncontrollably drunk though, because there might be some lines that you cross.

64
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Or just fake drunk.

65
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Drink a bunch of non-alcoholic beer and then pretend to be drunk and just kind of feel your way through and see how it goes.

66
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
All great relationships start that way.

67
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
People pretend to be drunk.

68
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:16,000
What I would suggest is pretend like you read her mind.

69
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:20,000
And it's not that she was drunk, that you maybe saw a little insight there.

70
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:26,000
But you can't use that information because you stole that information from her.

71
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Travis is suggesting a mind freak.

72
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Yeah, the mind freak.

73
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
You got a mind freaker.

74
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:36,000
So you're saying pretend to have extra sensory powers?

75
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:40,000
I'm saying pretend like you have this information, but you can't use the information.

76
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:44,000
You can't go up to her and be like, hey, remember the other night when you were drunk?

77
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
You can't ever use it.

78
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:51,000
But maybe that bolsters your confidence and you can say, well, maybe it's time to ask her out.

79
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Yeah.

80
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:56,000
You acquired that information via telepathy.

81
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Mind freaker.

82
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,000
You can't drop a mind freak reference in the non-expect.

83
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:04,000
It's because she did not choose to give you that information.

84
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
You pried it from her mind using mental powers.

85
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Yeah, more or less.

86
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Mind freaker and then you real freaked her.

87
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:18,000
When you do pretend to be drunk, make sure you pretend to be super duper incapacitated drunk and not fun drunk.

88
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Pretend to throw up on yourself.

89
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Yeah, pretend to throw up on yourself, really commit.

90
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Just put a back scratcher down your throat or something and whore fall over the floor.

91
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,000
And then I think this would be good.

92
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Take off your clothes except for your underwear and start pretending to be a baby.

93
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Because if she tends to, like if she continues to tend to you even after you're like,

94
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Pick me up! Pick me up!

95
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Like in a fake brief, like a BBD diaper.

96
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
That's love.

97
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
She's into it then.

98
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
You will have cracked that case.

99
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,000
You might be pushing the river there.

100
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
You might be shooting the cannon indoors.

101
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
I think a little bit.

102
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Just overdoing it a touch.

103
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:02,000
But boy, she loves you.

104
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,000
She'll take care of you after that or even look at you in the eye.

105
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
To clarify, don't do anything.

106
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Don't do anything.

107
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:13,000
How do I make someone listen to me that doesn't want to or make them do something I tell them to do?

108
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Kitty cat, Gmail.

109
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:18,000
This is actually something I've been thinking about a lot lately.

110
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:24,000
The difference between respect and fear and like the absence of those two things.

111
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Like when you tell someone to do something, they're either going to do it because they're afraid of you.

112
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Or because they want to make you happy.

113
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
On some level.

114
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Even if it's like a minor thing.

115
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,000
And this is where the telepathy comes in.

116
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
You use your mind powers.

117
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:44,000
You mind freak them and then they'll do whatever you want.

118
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Travis, why didn't I just go to Jimmy John's and get you a turkey club?

119
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Mind freak!

120
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
I mind freaked you.

121
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
I mind freaked you into doing that for me. Thank you.

122
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Where is my coleslaw?

123
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
I think you can't.

124
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:03,000
You can't make anyone do anything.

125
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:07,000
The only thing you can do is make someone want to do something.

126
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:15,000
And if you first take an interest in that person and show them that you respect them and that you care what they think.

127
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Then they're going to be more inclined to listen to you, I believe.

128
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:28,000
And also, as far as listening to you, picking your battles and stuff like that.

129
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Not just being the person that makes a big deal out of everything.

130
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Because then you're the boy who cried wolf and nobody listens to you.

131
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:44,000
But if you pick and choose and you only fight the battles that you're willing to fight that are important to you, people will respect your opinion a lot more.

132
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:52,000
I also talk less because if it's a rarity, people will be like, whoa, everyone hush up.

133
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:56,000
They say still waters run deep.

134
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Do they say that?

135
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
They say that.

136
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
That might be among the things that you can say.

137
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Maybe if you just said that.

138
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Over and over and over again.

139
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Yeah, like long periods of silence punctuated by-

140
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:10,000
While holding yours and rocking back and forth.

141
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
You know still waters run deep.

142
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
What?

143
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Did you say something?

144
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
No.

145
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:22,000
People will do things that you want them to do if they think that you're one bad decision away from murdering them.

146
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:26,000
I think that you can create a whole veneer for yourself.

147
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Oh, like a kitty cat, that girl we know who's always close to murder.

148
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Just like a step away from murder.

149
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:39,000
We should probably keep doing what she wants us to do for her.

150
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Griff, do you have a Yahoo answer for me?

151
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
I have several.

152
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Okay.

153
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
We should explain.

154
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:52,000
The Yahoo answer service allows awful people to have their questions answered by equally awful, sometimes slightly more awful people.

155
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:58,000
And we like to comb that service and help those people even though they didn't ask for our help.

156
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Let's charity.

157
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Let's do one that's going to get us in the holiday spirit.

158
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Yeah.

159
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
This one was sent in by Matt Brooks.

160
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Thanks, Matt Brooks.

161
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:10,000
It's by Yahoo answers user, Taco B.

162
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Who asks?

163
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:17,000
Ladies, X-mas gift?

164
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Ladies, if your sexual partner asked for you to walk on him with your high heels for Christmas and that's the only gift he wants this year, would you do that for him?

165
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Would you step on his privates for him with your sexiest heels if he proved it does not harm him at all?

166
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Man, I wish I could be there for that particular Mr. Wizard experiment.

167
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Let's prove that high heels don't injure my genitals.

168
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:47,000
I have empirical evidence that you stepping right on my balls with your sexiest heels.

169
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
This is my hypothesis.

170
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
Not a scratch nor bruise.

171
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:55,000
I like that he clears up it's the only thing he wants for Christmas.

172
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Well, I should hope so.

173
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:07,000
You can't be like, I'd like you to crush my genitals with your sexiest heels and also a Kindle.

174
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:13,000
I mean, this seems like kind of a shitty present.

175
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Yeah, it is.

176
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:22,000
By anyone's standards, like even if you're into this kind of thing, like even if you were the biggest like ball crush fan on the planet, this seems like...

177
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,000
And I am.

178
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Yeah.

179
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:27,000
Not a lot of thought went into this.

180
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,000
Yeah.

181
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:32,000
It's like Griffin really loves mixing bowls.

182
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
Let's get him a mixing bowl for Christmas.

183
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
That's far too obvious.

184
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,000
That's way too obvious.

185
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,000
You didn't think...

186
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
No heart, no love went into that decision.

187
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,000
You know what I'm saying?

188
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
Like you've got to flip it on him.

189
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:48,000
Make him think that you're going to step on his balls for Christmas and then maybe like step on his butthole.

190
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:54,000
Like it's a new thing that he doesn't know about, but maybe he'll be just as big a fan.

191
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,000
Discovery.

192
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,000
That's the real gift here.

193
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:03,000
What she needs to do is Christmas Eve sneak into the room wearing a Santa suit and her sexiest heels.

194
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
And he's like asleep, right?

195
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:12,000
He's conked out, visions of sugar plums dancing in his head, and then she just crushes his balls.

196
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
And his sugar plums.

197
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,000
And his sugar plums.

198
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
He just crushes his sugar plums.

199
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:25,000
Do you think that he would have time to get aroused or do you think like your fight or flight would kick in?

200
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
Oh man, I would be out of...

201
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:31,000
There would be a Griffin shaped cloud in the bed.

202
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
It would be nice to know he's real though.

203
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,000
Yeah.

204
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
That kind of empirical evidence.

205
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
Maybe not.

206
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:45,000
What if all eight of his reindeer like just went to town, just trampled your business?

207
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
Trampled your jingle bells?

208
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,000
Yeah.

209
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:53,000
Man, there's a lot of Christmas themed names for your testicles now that I think about it.

210
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:57,000
Yeah, you'll be sorry that they stepped on your balls.

211
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:03,000
I think that it's normal.

212
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,000
Is it?

213
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,000
It is.

214
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:09,000
It's okay to ask, especially if your GF is cheap.

215
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
Man, she'll be stoked.

216
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,000
What do you want?

217
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,000
Yeah, I'll do that.

218
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,000
Yeah, I'll step on your balls.

219
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
Step on your balls right here, look.

220
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
Step on your balls.

221
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:22,000
They should make a remake of Jingle All The Way.

222
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,000
Uh-huh.

223
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:27,000
Where instead of a young boy who wants a turbo man.

224
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,000
Uh-huh.

225
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:36,000
It's like a creepy, pervy, seedy dude who just wants a ball march.

226
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
Just one ball march.

227
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:44,000
We'll call it Jingle All The Way to the Emergency Room and an awkward conversation with your primary physician.

228
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
That's good.

229
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
There's an answer on this question that I really like.

230
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:55,000
It's by Yahoo Answers user Seedless Hamster who says, I hate the people who use Xmas instead of Christmas.

231
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
That's your complaint, doc?

232
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,000
That's your concern?

233
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:01,000
Pick your battles, dude.

234
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:05,000
I would argue in this case that XXXmas would be more appropriate.

235
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:10,000
God, what a, people are, ugh, they're wretched.

236
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:16,000
So let's move on to something more life-affirming, an actual listener writing in.

237
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:20,000
Since high school, none of my relationships have lasted longer than three months.

238
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:25,000
After that initial honeymoon phase, the girl tends to lose interest in me and break things off.

239
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
Is there something I'm doing wrong?

240
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
Am I possibly being over-romantic?

241
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:33,000
Or are women just not interested in me after they learn more about me?

242
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:37,000
What advice do you have on keeping the girl?

243
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:41,000
Three months seems like a pretty good length for a relationship.

244
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:44,000
You can get a lot done in three months.

245
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:51,000
I would posit that maybe you're not really being yourself at the beginning of a relationship.

246
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:58,000
So three months in, when you start being yourself, it's not the person that they fell for.

247
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:02,000
So my advice would be, be yourself from the get-go.

248
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,000
Yeah.

249
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:07,000
It sounds like, I think what Travis is saying, and this could be a distinct possibility,

250
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:10,000
that you're too good at getting into relationships.

251
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
Yeah.

252
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:20,000
Also, are you really, are you, this sounds like a long series of people.

253
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:23,000
Are you really into these girls?

254
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:29,000
Because what I'm getting the sense from you is that they leave you, and that's what's bothering you,

255
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:33,000
but not that you, like, I want to know where you're at with them.

256
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:38,000
Because it sounds like there's a lot of girls who are coming and going here,

257
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:43,000
and you seem more worried about how they perceive you than actually losing them.

258
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:46,000
So maybe you weren't that interested in them.

259
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:50,000
If you're so worried about how they're perceiving you and you're trying to be romantic,

260
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:54,000
you're trying to keep their interest, that's a huge turn-off.

261
00:15:54,000 --> 00:16:01,000
Like, you know, being yourself and being relaxed with them is much more interesting and much more relaxing for them.

262
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:04,000
If you're working hard, it puts them on edge, you know,

263
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:07,000
because they never feel comfortable in the relationship either.

264
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,000
Yeah.

265
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,000
That's good.

266
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:14,000
It's a toughie, because without actually, without more information, knowing what,

267
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:19,000
but let me put it another way, you're not necessarily doing anything wrong.

268
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:27,000
You know, if after three months someone decides, I don't want to be with this person anymore, then that's okay.

269
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:34,000
Like, that's their right, but it's good for you because it's somebody who didn't want to, wasn't going to work out for you.

270
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:38,000
You know, you can have infinity three-month relationships.

271
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:43,000
Have as many as you want to, and when it's right, she'll be in for the long haul.

272
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:49,000
And honestly, if it doesn't pan out after three months, good for you because that is not, yeah.

273
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
You got out early under the wire.

274
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,000
Yeah, really.

275
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:56,000
You got off pretty easy if it's not going to be the right person.

276
00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:01,000
It sounds like you're pretty economically knocking off dead ends.

277
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:04,000
Maybe it's not anything that you're worried about right now.

278
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,000
I think you're on the right path.

279
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:09,000
I think if you really want to do something about it, like if it's become like a serious problem for you,

280
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:13,000
go like two years without dating anybody.

281
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:18,000
And then after that, you'll just, you'll want anything.

282
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
You'll just want something.

283
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,000
This took a weird turn.

284
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
You'll just want anything.

285
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:29,000
You'll keep it like a precious flower that you tend to in your loneliness garden.

286
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:33,000
Yeah, it should be a recipe for long-term relationship success.

287
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,000
Desperation.

288
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:41,000
Starve yourself and give yourself like intravenous love, affection.

289
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,000
Hello, brothers.

290
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:45,000
I have just recently made a Facebook.

291
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
What are your guidelines for friending people?

292
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:52,000
Should I friend only my best friends, my friends, people that I've seen around but don't know too well, et cetera?

293
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:56,000
Because I'm getting friend requests from people that I don't even know.

294
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
Jack from Michigan.

295
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
I collect people on Facebook.

296
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,000
Yeah.

297
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:09,000
I have like a collection, like stamps or, you know, like preserved beetles,

298
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:12,000
which I don't want people to get weirded out when I say that.

299
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,000
Maybe a little weirded out.

300
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:16,000
Now, you say you're having trouble getting into a relationship, Griffin,

301
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:19,000
and you have a collection of preserved human beetles?

302
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,000
Yeah.

303
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:24,000
Well, that's, I mean, I'm starving myself, right?

304
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,000
Like I'm on that diet.

305
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,000
I'm on a cleanse.

306
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,000
You're on a love cleanse?

307
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
I'm on a love cleanse.

308
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:36,000
But when it's time to flip the script, like when it's time for me to flip my whole program on its ear,

309
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:46,000
I've got like 1,800 preserved people that I can just like dive into like fucking Scrooge McDuck's money vault.

310
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:50,000
You best believe, like joke now, but when I flip this fish.

311
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:55,000
Do you believe the humans encased in amber and just insert a straw and suck the marrow from them?

312
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,000
Just suck their love marrow out them.

313
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
Like, oh man, I can't wait.

314
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:04,000
I haven't set a date for when I'm going to flip it and just get so right,

315
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:08,000
but I think it's going to be February next year.

316
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,000
Oh yeah.

317
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,000
Valentine's Day.

318
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:13,000
I like it.

319
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:18,000
I keep a pretty tight ship of people that I, here's my rule of thumb.

320
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:23,000
If someone were to tell me what they were doing that day and I know them well enough

321
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:28,000
where that would be relevant, interesting relationship information for me, then I would friend them.

322
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:36,000
But if it's just going to be like just a stream of people saying inanities that only means things to them

323
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:44,000
and people who know them better than I do, or super Jesusy, then they're not going to be friended.

324
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:49,000
And by super Jesusy, I mean just it's Facebook, man.

325
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,000
It's Facebook.

326
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,000
Just chill out.

327
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:54,000
Talk about the cool sandwich you had or something.

328
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:59,000
I have a similar, like I'll add anybody, right?

329
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,000
Anybody who sends me a friend request.

330
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,000
Yeah, fuck it.

331
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:05,000
I'll add them because of the people vault.

332
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:10,000
But the first, like if I see someone who's like Jubaama, I'm like, you're done.

333
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,000
You're so done.

334
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,000
You're out.

335
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
What does that even mean, Jubaama?

336
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
Think about the things you're saying before you put them on the internet.

337
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,000
You're gone.

338
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,000
Yeah.

339
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:22,000
People don't, people don't, people don't think before they post.

340
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:26,000
They're not, they're not considering the repercussions of their actions.

341
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
They're just shouting into the ether.

342
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
But that's what, that's what the internet is, right?

343
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:38,000
The internet is a thing that people can just shout whatever comes to, like whatever floats to the top of the garbage pile that is their mind.

344
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,000
And they just throw that on the internet.

345
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:47,000
What's, what's crazy though is Facebook is like, it's a website where people you actually know,

346
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:53,000
like exclusively people you actually know can see like the garbage that you think and put on the internet.

347
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,000
Yeah.

348
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,000
That's what Twitter is for.

349
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,000
There's no censorship there.

350
00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:04,000
My, my only problem with Facebook is I honestly don't care if you want to post your random rantings about various things.

351
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:09,000
Just don't fool yourself into thinking other people care about what you think.

352
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:14,000
Like you can throw that out there, but no one's going to respond to it unless it's to say that you're dumb.

353
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:17,000
Otherwise, just keep that shit to yourself.

354
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:22,000
You're not going to change anyone's mind because of something you posted on Facebook.

355
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:27,000
I feel like there's so many needs to come up with some kind of, I don't know, protocol.

356
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:35,000
Some kind of like, like, like a Facebook cotillion where people can learn the right and wrong things to do.

357
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,000
Like Emily posts.

358
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,000
Yeah.

359
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,000
What's that?

360
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,000
Like Emily post for, for Facebook.

361
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,000
I don't know.

362
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:44,000
Ms. Manners type Emily wall posts.

363
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,000
Hey, holy shit.

364
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,000
Wow.

365
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,000
We're on something now.

366
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,000
Quick, quick.

367
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,000
Don't let this idea fire die.

368
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:55,000
Throw some Emily, Emily, Emily wall posts.

369
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,000
What does she tell you?

370
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:01,000
What does she, what does she, what are, what are some of her key lessons?

371
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:04,000
Never post anything you wouldn't want your mom to read.

372
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,000
That's good.

373
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:09,000
Don't tag images of people that they're not actually in.

374
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:12,000
Unless it's the, my brother, my brother and me party.

375
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:16,000
Unless it's the, my brother, my brother and me party, which is now up to what, 12, 13?

376
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,000
I don't know.

377
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:20,000
Monlock and his crew are repping the set.

378
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,000
Repping so hard.

379
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:25,000
Please spell check.

380
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,000
Yeah.

381
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:31,000
I don't want to have to, I know that it's very tempting to be like, it's snowing with like three W's.

382
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,000
Just stop it.

383
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:34,000
I know.

384
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,000
I'm here too.

385
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,000
I've heard about this.

386
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:40,000
And by the way, if you see snow, it's snowing all over the world.

387
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,000
So we all know.

388
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,000
Yeah, we're all right there with you.

389
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,000
We're all there in that boat.

390
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:48,000
No cryptic posts about how heartbroken you are.

391
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,000
Like, I can't believe you hurt me like this.

392
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,000
Dot, dot, dot.

393
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,000
I'm okay with those.

394
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:55,000
I fucking drink those up.

395
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,000
Oh, the ones that are like missing you.

396
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:58,000
Dot, dot, dot.

397
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,000
I sustain myself on people's anonymous sadness.

398
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:03,000
Like, yes.

399
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:07,000
What I always can see is this is always the chain you see.

400
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,000
I can't believe you've done this, you monster.

401
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:14,000
And then right after it, ten seconds later, a concerned friend is like, oh my God, what happened?

402
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,000
Is it Jeff?

403
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:16,000
Is he okay?

404
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:20,000
And then she's like, my TiVo didn't record Real Housewives of Orange County.

405
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:25,000
It's not as big a deal because this is a good sort of rule of thumb.

406
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:32,000
Maybe not for Emily Walpost, but if you are able to post on Facebook.

407
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,000
Shit ain't that bad.

408
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,000
Shit's pretty good for you.

409
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:37,000
Shit's pretty good for you.

410
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:42,000
Like, by the virtue of the fact that you are posting on Facebook, shit's okay.

411
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,000
You are okay.

412
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:51,000
If you are listed as being in a relationship and it's complicated, go fuck yourself in the neck.

413
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,000
That's the dumbest thing I've ever heard.

414
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:55,000
That's a shitty thing.

415
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:59,000
Like, I'm in a complicated relationship with this very person.

416
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:02,000
First of all, that could mean anything.

417
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:05,000
Second of all, you're just airing your dirty laundry.

418
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:11,000
That seems equivalent to like, I'm in a relationship and we're having some problems.

419
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:12,000
Especially when it changes.

420
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,000
That's my status.

421
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:16,000
When you're in a relationship and then it goes to, it's complicated.

422
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:19,000
It's like, oh, this is really weird.

423
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:21,000
This is complicated.

424
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:24,000
Hey guys, we're having a really brutal fight.

425
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,000
She hates my parents.

426
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:29,000
They should have an option on the ropes.

427
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,000
Down for the count.

428
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:32,000
Down for the count.

429
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,000
Swirl in the drain.

430
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:34,000
Oh no.

431
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:35,000
TKO.

432
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:37,000
There's a whole spectrum of things.

433
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:39,000
Like, friends with benefits.

434
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:43,000
If we're going to do this, let's do it right.

435
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:46,000
Just making my parents mad because he's black.

436
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,000
Experimenting.

437
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:48,000
There's lots of different options.

438
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,000
Yeah.

439
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:50,000
Trying something new.

440
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:53,000
Saying this person is my wife, but really, they're just my best friend.

441
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:54,000
Ha ha ha.

442
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,000
Ha ha ha.

443
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:56,000
Cortisol.

444
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:59,000
Those are always the ones that piss me off.

445
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:00,000
Total beard.

446
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:05,000
People that are like, she is married to her.

447
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:06,000
They're best friends.

448
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,000
God, I hate that.

449
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:13,000
Can't you wait until Facebook status is our law?

450
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:16,000
In the future, there will be no wedding ceremonies.

451
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,000
It's just like you change your Facebook status.

452
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:23,000
So all those people are like, oh shit, I married Susan.

453
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:25,000
I've been dating.

454
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:27,000
This is another city of love.

455
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:29,000
Relationships dating and marriage.

456
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:34,000
I've been dating my girlfriend over two years and I wanted to get her a ring for Christmas.

457
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:35,000
Not an engagement ring.

458
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:37,000
My co-workers say this is a bad idea.

459
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:39,000
How bad could it be?

460
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:40,000
Ha ha ha.

461
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:41,000
So bad.

462
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:44,000
Never, never ask that question.

463
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,000
That's how bad could it be?

464
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:51,000
Like if you end an idea with that, the answer is almost always like so bad.

465
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:56,000
It's so bad that your Facebook status is going to change to it's complicated the day after.

466
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:57,000
December 26th.

467
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:58,000
Yeah.

468
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:03,000
And I'll be the one clucking my tongue saying, bitch, we try to tell you, don't do that.

469
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:05,000
That is a bad idea.

470
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:07,000
That's a bad idea.

471
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:09,000
Anything but a ring.

472
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,000
Like a necklace.

473
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:14,000
A ring holds too much significance.

474
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:19,000
Or, or, sack up and propose to her.

475
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:21,000
Oh my god.

476
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:22,000
Yes.

477
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:23,000
This is what we're doing now.

478
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:25,000
This is our Christmas Eve.

479
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:32,000
The thing about a ring is maybe back in the day where all engagement rings were so cookie

480
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:33,000
cutter, right?

481
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:36,000
There was a gold band and then a diamond on the end of it.

482
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:37,000
Right?

483
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:41,000
But nowadays people are like going to those 25 cent like gotcha gotcha machines and like

484
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:43,000
buying rings and like it's so romantic.

485
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:44,000
This is from the arcade where we met.

486
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:45,000
Now we're married.

487
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:52,000
Uh, that any ring you give her for like us, even a split second in her mind, it's going

488
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:56,000
to be like this ring has Spiderman's face on it.

489
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,000
But like, is that anything?

490
00:26:58,000 --> 00:26:59,000
Yeah.

491
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:02,000
I think he's just been listening to too much Beyonce.

492
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:03,000
Like he likes it.

493
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:04,000
He does.

494
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:05,000
He does like it.

495
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:07,000
So he thinks he should put a ring on it, but he doesn't understand.

496
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:09,000
There's a symbolism being referenced in that song.

497
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:11,000
It's about, it's about getting engaged.

498
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:13,000
Um, let me, let me walk you through this.

499
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:18,000
I'm going to, since if you're not getting it, I need to like break it down profiler

500
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:19,000
for you.

501
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:20,000
Here's what's going to happen.

502
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:25,000
You, uh, hopefully standing or seated, not kneeling.

503
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:34,000
Uh, you give her this ring, this, this Christmas ring and she opens it and for a hot second

504
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:37,000
she thinks she's getting engaged that day.

505
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:42,000
Her mind fills with the visions of the wedding she's dreamed of since she was just a little,

506
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:43,000
a little tyke.

507
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:46,000
And then you tell her just a ring.

508
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:47,000
Yeah.

509
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:55,000
There's an, and it may be a very nice ring, but she's going to instantly not like it

510
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:56,000
very much.

511
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,000
She'll always think of it as my disappointment ring.

512
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,000
How about flip side, flip side.

513
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,000
You've only been dating two months.

514
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,000
She opens up the box.

515
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:05,000
Oh shit.

516
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:07,000
I'm so not ready to get engaged.

517
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:08,000
Oh cool.

518
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,000
It's just a regular ring.

519
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,000
That sucks for you though.

520
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,000
Cause you're going to catch that look on her face.

521
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:15,000
Lie to me style.

522
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:18,000
It's, it's been two years split second frown.

523
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:19,000
It has been two years.

524
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:21,000
Oh, it says two years, doesn't it?

525
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:27,000
How about a big four knuckle ring that covers the entire front of her hand that says not

526
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:28,000
what you think.

527
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:33,000
And so she opens it up and goes, then what is it?

528
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:35,000
And you say, it's just a big ring.

529
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:42,000
That's great because she can use that as brass knuckles to punch you in your Christmas balls.

530
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,000
And maybe that's his fantasy.

531
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:45,000
She'll save some money.

532
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:47,000
Everybody wins.

533
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:55,000
Listen, we have a, normally when like the steam runs out on a gag, we tend to move on

534
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:57,000
and sort of hop, skip and jump to the next question.

535
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:01,000
When the comedy juice has been extracted for a particular question, I'm going to really

536
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:04,000
take a step back here and say, like, don't do that.

537
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:05,000
Don't do it at all.

538
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:06,000
Please don't do that.

539
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,000
Like, this is a serious request from your friends.

540
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:09,000
I'd rather move over to me.

541
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:10,000
Don't do that.

542
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:13,000
There will be that half second and you will ruin her Christmas.

543
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:21,000
Maybe even subconsciously, but there will at least be a hitch in her giddy up, a pause

544
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:26,000
in the air where something's going to have to be clarified, especially after two years.

545
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,000
A hitch in her giddy up?

546
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:29,000
Yeah.

547
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:30,000
That's a thing.

548
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:31,000
Are you 80?

549
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:33,000
Yes, I am.

550
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:40,000
Um, if after two years she's thinking it, so like she's on the lookout.

551
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:41,000
Right.

552
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:42,000
Right.

553
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:43,000
Or I like this.

554
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:44,000
I like Trapp's idea.

555
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:45,000
I do.

556
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:46,000
Just propose.

557
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:47,000
Yeah.

558
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:48,000
Just go ahead and fucking do it.

559
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:49,000
Make it magic.

560
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:54,000
Think about how magical that could be.

561
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:55,000
Oh man.

562
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:56,000
Christmas lights twinkling.

563
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,000
Think about it, but like, don't do the other thing.

564
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:59,000
No, don't do that.

565
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:03,000
Maybe do the engagement thing like soup, like don't do it.

566
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:04,000
Okay.

567
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:05,000
Don't do it.

568
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:06,000
How about a Yahoo?

569
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,000
Well, I just wanted to touch real quick.

570
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:09,000
Okay.

571
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:11,000
If you have other Christmas questions, send them in.

572
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:14,000
We're doing an all holiday show next week.

573
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:18,000
Kwanzaa, Hanukkah, Ramadan, Ramadan.

574
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:19,000
What?

575
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:20,000
Yeah.

576
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:21,000
No, not Ramadan.

577
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:22,000
Yeah.

578
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:23,000
Ramadan.

579
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:24,000
Yeah.

580
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,000
Okay.

581
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:26,000
Yeah.

582
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:27,000
Eff it.

583
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:28,000
Ramadan.

584
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:29,000
Right.

585
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:30,000
If you have a question, we'll be all the way at the end of the show.

586
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,520
Make sure to include not only your question, but if you have any family traditions, anything

587
00:30:32,520 --> 00:30:35,200
like that, we'll talk more about it later.

588
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:36,640
Also with pagan witchness.

589
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:38,040
We forgot pagan witchness.

590
00:30:38,040 --> 00:30:39,040
Yes.

591
00:30:39,040 --> 00:30:40,040
Winter solstice.

592
00:30:40,040 --> 00:30:41,040
Yeah.

593
00:30:41,040 --> 00:30:45,760
If you have holiday traditions, send them in to us and we'll tell you if they're weird

594
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:46,760
or not.

595
00:30:46,760 --> 00:30:48,700
Which they probably are.

596
00:30:48,700 --> 00:30:52,760
If it includes stepping on balls with sexy high heels, bad news.

597
00:30:52,760 --> 00:30:53,760
Yeah.

598
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:54,840
Send that to my personal address.

599
00:30:54,840 --> 00:30:56,600
Griffin hit me with a Yahoo?

600
00:30:56,600 --> 00:30:57,600
Sure.

601
00:30:57,600 --> 00:30:59,040
This one is sent in by Modest Madison.

602
00:30:59,040 --> 00:31:00,040
Thank you, Modest Madison.

603
00:31:00,040 --> 00:31:01,120
Thank you, Modest Madison.

604
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:05,560
This is by Yahoo Answers user Dearest Love, who asks,

605
00:31:05,560 --> 00:31:06,960
friend might be a robot.

606
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:09,160
Help.

607
00:31:09,160 --> 00:31:10,160
OK.

608
00:31:10,160 --> 00:31:13,400
So my best friend of 15 years might be a robot.

609
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:17,040
She beeps and boops and has a crazy phobia of water.

610
00:31:17,040 --> 00:31:20,400
And sometimes she spazzes out like a machine overheating.

611
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:22,200
Should I confront her and be like,

612
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:24,680
I think you might be a robot, or leave it alone?

613
00:31:24,680 --> 00:31:26,480
Help.

614
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:29,680
Now, listen, straight up, everyone's immediate reaction

615
00:31:29,680 --> 00:31:31,400
is going to be to mock this person?

616
00:31:31,400 --> 00:31:32,760
No, no, no.

617
00:31:32,760 --> 00:31:34,800
Yeah, what the fuck?

618
00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:35,320
What if?

619
00:31:35,320 --> 00:31:36,400
It's an epidemic.

620
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:37,960
Yeah.

621
00:31:37,960 --> 00:31:38,920
This is what I'm saying.

622
00:31:38,920 --> 00:31:40,680
If we don't listen to these people,

623
00:31:40,680 --> 00:31:43,240
we are losing our first line of defense.

624
00:31:43,240 --> 00:31:44,320
This is how they get us.

625
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:44,820
Yeah.

626
00:31:48,920 --> 00:31:54,320
When someone someday has a friend who is secretly a robot,

627
00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:58,040
when they come, and they will, there's

628
00:31:58,040 --> 00:31:59,120
going to be at least one.

629
00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:00,320
It has to start somewhere.

630
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:01,840
That's what I'm saying.

631
00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:03,440
Like, there has to be a first.

632
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:05,480
And everyone thinks it's going to be Will Smith who's

633
00:32:05,480 --> 00:32:07,880
going to be that person who flips it.

634
00:32:07,880 --> 00:32:10,040
But I think it's going to be people like you and me

635
00:32:10,040 --> 00:32:11,520
and Dearest Love.

636
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:13,160
Yeah.

637
00:32:13,160 --> 00:32:14,660
Let's get the conversation started.

638
00:32:14,660 --> 00:32:18,680
Here's a response by Yahoo Answers user James, who says,

639
00:32:18,680 --> 00:32:21,680
splash her with water and be like, oh, sorry,

640
00:32:21,680 --> 00:32:23,040
I thought you were a robot.

641
00:32:23,040 --> 00:32:28,280
If she dies, if she dies, she was a robot.

642
00:32:28,280 --> 00:32:28,780
OK.

643
00:32:28,780 --> 00:32:30,320
Fundamental problem right here, people

644
00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:32,040
aren't using their fucking noodle.

645
00:32:32,040 --> 00:32:34,920
If she's a witch, she'll die too.

646
00:32:34,920 --> 00:32:36,080
Yeah, think about that.

647
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:37,680
What's up, mind freak?

648
00:32:37,680 --> 00:32:43,640
The preferred response here is to close her off

649
00:32:43,640 --> 00:32:48,160
in a room with no access to electricity or food or water

650
00:32:48,160 --> 00:32:50,760
for two weeks or three weeks.

651
00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:55,280
And then if she is able to, if she dies without electricity.

652
00:32:55,280 --> 00:32:56,240
Robot.

653
00:32:56,240 --> 00:32:57,120
Or food or water.

654
00:32:57,120 --> 00:32:57,960
She's a robot.

655
00:32:57,960 --> 00:32:58,600
Yeah.

656
00:32:58,600 --> 00:33:00,960
That's science.

657
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:03,920
You could ask her to divide by zero

658
00:33:03,920 --> 00:33:05,680
to see what that does to her noodle.

659
00:33:05,680 --> 00:33:06,280
Oh, shit.

660
00:33:06,280 --> 00:33:06,680
Yeah.

661
00:33:06,680 --> 00:33:07,000
Yeah.

662
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:07,500
Oh, yeah.

663
00:33:07,500 --> 00:33:09,600
You've got to pose a logic puzzle to her.

664
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:10,160
Yeah.

665
00:33:10,160 --> 00:33:12,800
Like, could God make a rock so big that he couldn't move it?

666
00:33:12,800 --> 00:33:14,000
Yeah.

667
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:16,720
If it's a religious robot, I guess,

668
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:20,560
and not a religi-bot.

669
00:33:20,560 --> 00:33:23,000
I'm Bible-y, the Bible-bot.

670
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:24,680
I know all the verses.

671
00:33:24,680 --> 00:33:27,880
What if you were to say, hey, pi.

672
00:33:27,880 --> 00:33:30,060
What was pi again, that number?

673
00:33:30,060 --> 00:33:31,960
And then try to remember it.

674
00:33:31,960 --> 00:33:34,480
And if she goes any more than four or five digits,

675
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:36,160
I'm going to go ahead and call robot.

676
00:33:36,160 --> 00:33:37,840
Well, she might have that Rain Man thing.

677
00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:38,320
Oh, fuck.

678
00:33:38,320 --> 00:33:39,640
Is Rain Man a robot?

679
00:33:39,640 --> 00:33:40,720
Yes.

680
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:44,340
That would be so much better now.

681
00:33:44,340 --> 00:33:46,000
Ask her to watch AI.

682
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,720
And if she enjoys it, she's a robot.

683
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:51,160
Rain Man is basically Minority Report now.

684
00:33:51,160 --> 00:33:53,720
It's like Minority Report prequel if you think about it.

685
00:33:57,400 --> 00:33:59,400
God damn, but people are stupid.

686
00:33:59,400 --> 00:34:00,520
Like, wow.

687
00:34:00,520 --> 00:34:03,480
It's getting bad out there, guys.

688
00:34:03,480 --> 00:34:04,840
It's getting rough.

689
00:34:04,840 --> 00:34:05,640
Yeah.

690
00:34:05,640 --> 00:34:06,360
I got a lot.

691
00:34:06,360 --> 00:34:09,080
This was a really bad week for just questions

692
00:34:09,080 --> 00:34:11,720
that are just the dumbest, like the dumbest people.

693
00:34:11,720 --> 00:34:14,840
Like the dumbest, just the dumbest people on the planet.

694
00:34:14,840 --> 00:34:17,240
I need to recalibrate here.

695
00:34:17,240 --> 00:34:19,360
MBMA, I'm tired of where I live.

696
00:34:19,360 --> 00:34:20,960
I want to pack my bags and move away

697
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:23,800
while I'm still young enough for it to be feasible.

698
00:34:23,800 --> 00:34:26,160
I don't know if I should work towards moving to Los Angeles

699
00:34:26,160 --> 00:34:27,080
or New York.

700
00:34:27,080 --> 00:34:29,600
What do you suggest, aimless actor?

701
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:31,800
I suggest getting a job.

702
00:34:31,800 --> 00:34:32,800
Nah, fuck it.

703
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:33,760
Get a real job.

704
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:34,760
Yeah.

705
00:34:34,760 --> 00:34:35,360
No, no, no.

706
00:34:35,360 --> 00:34:40,880
I think he's saying LA or New York.

707
00:34:40,880 --> 00:34:42,200
So between those two?

708
00:34:42,200 --> 00:34:42,920
Neither.

709
00:34:42,920 --> 00:34:45,720
You should go to Chicago or Miami or Utah.

710
00:34:45,720 --> 00:34:48,000
Really?

711
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:48,760
Yeah.

712
00:34:48,760 --> 00:34:50,000
Utah Shakes.

713
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:51,840
Huge theater company there.

714
00:34:51,840 --> 00:34:53,120
Also, Canada.

715
00:34:53,120 --> 00:34:55,840
A lot of movies are being filmed in Canada these days.

716
00:34:55,840 --> 00:34:58,680
If you can go to like Montreal or Winnipeg,

717
00:34:58,680 --> 00:35:00,840
there's a lot of movies being filmed up north.

718
00:35:00,840 --> 00:35:01,800
Vancouver.

719
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:03,840
Vancouver.

720
00:35:03,840 --> 00:35:12,040
I just want to put in a hearty warning against Los Angeles.

721
00:35:12,040 --> 00:35:14,760
I know very few people who have moved there

722
00:35:14,760 --> 00:35:17,440
and want to continue living there.

723
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:23,280
And I understand like City of Dreams and stuff, whatever.

724
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:26,880
But man, I don't like Los Angeles.

725
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:31,480
The thing is those two cities are like the tourist attraction

726
00:35:31,480 --> 00:35:33,040
of acting.

727
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:37,600
Everybody shows up to a place like Orlando

728
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:39,400
and wants to go to Universal Studios

729
00:35:39,400 --> 00:35:43,400
and to Disneyland for the traditional Florida

730
00:35:43,400 --> 00:35:44,280
experience or whatever.

731
00:35:44,280 --> 00:35:46,920
But there's so many other fun places

732
00:35:46,920 --> 00:35:49,280
to go where there's not as big crowds.

733
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:52,400
It doesn't cost as much to go there.

734
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:56,320
You're saying they should look for the Dollywood of acting,

735
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:56,840
right?

736
00:35:56,840 --> 00:35:57,320
Yeah.

737
00:35:57,320 --> 00:36:00,400
Honestly, find the place that's right for you.

738
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:02,800
Don't just go to New York or LA because that's

739
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:04,680
where you feel you have to go to work.

740
00:36:04,680 --> 00:36:06,640
Can I suggest Dollywood?

741
00:36:06,640 --> 00:36:07,120
Yeah.

742
00:36:07,120 --> 00:36:11,320
I'm sure they have some kind of dance ensemble.

743
00:36:11,320 --> 00:36:13,880
There are so many people there trying to be famous.

744
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:15,240
Like so many.

745
00:36:15,240 --> 00:36:16,520
And I get that.

746
00:36:16,520 --> 00:36:17,080
I get it.

747
00:36:17,080 --> 00:36:18,920
New York, things are happening.

748
00:36:18,920 --> 00:36:21,720
Like it's an exciting place.

749
00:36:21,720 --> 00:36:23,280
LA, I don't know.

750
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:24,600
I don't get it with LA.

751
00:36:24,600 --> 00:36:26,240
But stick with New York.

752
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:28,520
New York, there's a lot of stuff going on.

753
00:36:28,520 --> 00:36:31,760
But there are so many people there trying to eat your lunch.

754
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:34,120
Don't you want a place where you can just have your lunch

755
00:36:34,120 --> 00:36:37,600
in peace and quiet?

756
00:36:37,600 --> 00:36:39,600
You may have less of a chance of getting

757
00:36:39,600 --> 00:36:44,760
super omega famous in a regional theater situation.

758
00:36:44,760 --> 00:36:46,800
But you'll be able to make a living acting.

759
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:49,840
And if that's what you really want,

760
00:36:49,840 --> 00:36:52,520
then maybe explore some of those options.

761
00:36:52,520 --> 00:36:57,520
If anything, it's more important in your chosen field

762
00:36:57,520 --> 00:37:01,640
of profession that you make contacts, make connections.

763
00:37:01,640 --> 00:37:03,600
And if you roll up to LA or New York

764
00:37:03,600 --> 00:37:05,960
without any connections or contacts,

765
00:37:05,960 --> 00:37:08,080
then you are just like the tens of thousands

766
00:37:08,080 --> 00:37:10,960
of people that roll up to LA and New York every day.

767
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:15,600
If you work in smaller markets at first,

768
00:37:15,600 --> 00:37:16,880
you'll meet more people.

769
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:18,320
You'll make those contacts.

770
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:20,920
And you won't just be showing up blindly with a suitcase

771
00:37:20,920 --> 00:37:23,600
saying, I'm ready, world.

772
00:37:23,600 --> 00:37:25,640
Be prepared.

773
00:37:25,640 --> 00:37:28,160
Have all the tools at your disposal ready to go.

774
00:37:28,160 --> 00:37:29,760
Don't just roll up expecting someone

775
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:32,120
to point at you and say, you, you're

776
00:37:32,120 --> 00:37:34,560
exactly what I've been looking for.

777
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:36,480
I'm Mr. Universal.

778
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:42,760
It's a long process, and you can't be one of the lead chorus

779
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:45,320
members in your local community theater's production

780
00:37:45,320 --> 00:37:47,320
of Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat

781
00:37:47,320 --> 00:37:49,240
and then be like, made it.

782
00:37:49,240 --> 00:37:50,400
What's next?

783
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:52,280
The silver screen.

784
00:37:52,280 --> 00:37:55,520
It doesn't work like that.

785
00:37:55,520 --> 00:37:58,940
When my friends and I talk about games and movies and the like,

786
00:37:58,940 --> 00:38:01,320
I tend to notice a lot of them say things that are just

787
00:38:01,320 --> 00:38:02,280
downright wrong.

788
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:05,380
I'm a sponge, so I know a lot of useless facts about stuff.

789
00:38:05,380 --> 00:38:07,440
So sometimes I feel like I should correct them.

790
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:11,200
However, when I do this, I feel like a grade A jerk.

791
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:12,960
Is it better to just go on pretending

792
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:14,520
what they said was right, or is there

793
00:38:14,520 --> 00:38:17,400
a way to inform them without being pompous and rude?

794
00:38:17,400 --> 00:38:18,720
Is there a way to correct someone

795
00:38:18,720 --> 00:38:22,280
without making yourself look like a know-it-all douchebag

796
00:38:22,280 --> 00:38:23,720
sad in New Jersey?

797
00:38:23,720 --> 00:38:25,120
Aw.

798
00:38:25,120 --> 00:38:26,680
Why is he so sad?

799
00:38:26,680 --> 00:38:27,560
Why are you sad?

800
00:38:27,560 --> 00:38:28,480
I don't understand why that question is so sad.

801
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:30,320
Because he's in New Jersey.

802
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:33,720
And he's a sponge, which is got to be rough.

803
00:38:33,720 --> 00:38:38,160
I have 100% definitive answer for you.

804
00:38:38,160 --> 00:38:45,160
You should not, when possible, you should not correct people.

805
00:38:45,160 --> 00:38:46,080
Ever.

806
00:38:46,080 --> 00:38:47,640
Ever.

807
00:38:47,640 --> 00:38:49,440
Think about the logic of the situation.

808
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:50,840
Someone says something wrong, right?

809
00:38:50,840 --> 00:38:58,000
Someone says Mr. 500 or Mr. 5,000.

810
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,480
What's that Bernie Mac movie?

811
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:01,760
Mr. 3,000.

812
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:05,000
Mr. 3,000 starred Cedric the Entertainer.

813
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:06,920
No, of course it didn't.

814
00:39:06,920 --> 00:39:07,840
And you know that.

815
00:39:07,840 --> 00:39:09,800
Deep down in your heart, you know that.

816
00:39:09,800 --> 00:39:12,400
But someone says it.

817
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:16,800
If you say, no, you're wrong, it was Bernie Mac,

818
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:20,560
then you might feel a little better about yourself

819
00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:21,280
for a second.

820
00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:22,920
But that person's going to be embarrassed,

821
00:39:22,920 --> 00:39:25,040
and they're going to think you're a jerk.

822
00:39:25,040 --> 00:39:27,240
Best just to keep your mouth shut.

823
00:39:27,240 --> 00:39:29,080
Because this conversation happens

824
00:39:29,080 --> 00:39:31,680
during your monthly meeting of the Bernie Mac fan club.

825
00:39:31,680 --> 00:39:34,440
And he's going to have fucking scrambled eggs

826
00:39:34,440 --> 00:39:35,680
all over his face.

827
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:37,120
And you did that to him.

828
00:39:37,120 --> 00:39:37,840
You did that.

829
00:39:37,840 --> 00:39:39,280
You can't wash that away.

830
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:40,000
I mean, you can.

831
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:43,800
But it'll take longer than you think.

832
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:46,840
If you need to correct someone, if you must,

833
00:39:46,840 --> 00:39:49,800
if it's a situation where their misconception could

834
00:39:49,800 --> 00:39:51,360
be damaging or could have some effect,

835
00:39:51,360 --> 00:39:56,040
it's not just a bunch of people shooting the shit.

836
00:39:56,040 --> 00:39:56,760
Put it this way.

837
00:39:56,760 --> 00:39:58,320
I may be wrong.

838
00:39:58,320 --> 00:40:00,160
I frequently am.

839
00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:02,560
But I think, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

840
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:04,440
Yeah, something like, are you sure?

841
00:40:04,440 --> 00:40:06,640
Or I don't know if that sounds right.

842
00:40:06,640 --> 00:40:09,480
But you don't want to jump on them and be like, wrong.

843
00:40:09,480 --> 00:40:13,440
Or you could just pull them aside and be like, listen,

844
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:16,240
I didn't want to embarrass you in front of the rest

845
00:40:16,240 --> 00:40:16,720
of the club.

846
00:40:16,720 --> 00:40:18,840
But I believe you meant to say Bernie Mac

847
00:40:18,840 --> 00:40:19,920
when you said that.

848
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:21,240
It's a common mistake.

849
00:40:21,240 --> 00:40:23,720
They were in a lot of shared movies.

850
00:40:23,720 --> 00:40:25,760
I think what you want to ask yourself

851
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:27,160
is, is this something that's going

852
00:40:27,160 --> 00:40:28,960
to continue the conversation?

853
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:30,920
Or is this something that's going to awkwardly

854
00:40:30,920 --> 00:40:32,880
end the conversation because I just called out

855
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:34,880
this person for no reason?

856
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:38,600
If you guys are having a debate about Tom Cruise movies

857
00:40:38,600 --> 00:40:40,680
and somebody brings up a movie that he wasn't in

858
00:40:40,680 --> 00:40:43,960
and you want to continue on the conversation, great.

859
00:40:43,960 --> 00:40:46,800
But don't just be a douchebag and correct your friend.

860
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:48,760
Why would they be talking about Tom Cruise movies

861
00:40:48,760 --> 00:40:50,760
during their Bernie Mac fan club meeting?

862
00:40:50,760 --> 00:40:51,680
It's a great question.

863
00:40:51,680 --> 00:40:55,920
Well, they had to share the hall because it was double booked.

864
00:40:55,920 --> 00:40:58,940
You need to get used to the satisfaction of knowing

865
00:40:58,940 --> 00:41:02,640
you're right without forcing everyone else to acknowledge

866
00:41:02,640 --> 00:41:05,200
that, unless you are Bernie Mac.

867
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:06,560
Unless you are Bernie Mac.

868
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:09,360
And then it's like, I told you I would be back from beyond.

869
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:15,600
What?

870
00:41:15,600 --> 00:41:16,960
Say it.

871
00:41:16,960 --> 00:41:17,800
I forgot.

872
00:41:17,800 --> 00:41:21,400
It really exited my mind and it entered and left really

873
00:41:21,400 --> 00:41:22,160
quickly.

874
00:41:22,160 --> 00:41:24,480
That's like Bernie Mac in this world, right?

875
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:27,520
Is that a metaphor for how he left us too soon?

876
00:41:27,520 --> 00:41:28,240
I remember now.

877
00:41:28,240 --> 00:41:29,960
I had a great idea.

878
00:41:29,960 --> 00:41:32,600
What if you did the exact opposite of what we're saying?

879
00:41:32,600 --> 00:41:33,160
OK.

880
00:41:33,160 --> 00:41:35,720
I'm not saying that you correct everyone all the time, right?

881
00:41:35,720 --> 00:41:37,000
Not in the middle of conversation.

882
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:38,440
So maybe this is a polite way to handle it.

883
00:41:38,440 --> 00:41:39,080
I don't know.

884
00:41:39,080 --> 00:41:40,280
Nobody's done it before.

885
00:41:40,280 --> 00:41:42,840
This is untreaded ground.

886
00:41:42,840 --> 00:41:43,800
OK.

887
00:41:43,800 --> 00:41:47,200
What if you published your own daily newsletter

888
00:41:47,200 --> 00:41:49,080
that you distributed to your friends, right?

889
00:41:49,080 --> 00:41:50,000
But it's not news.

890
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:52,480
It's corrections only, right?

891
00:41:52,480 --> 00:41:56,040
So every time anyone says any wrong shit,

892
00:41:56,040 --> 00:41:59,680
which it sounds like happens a lot in your group of friends,

893
00:41:59,680 --> 00:42:03,240
you just send out this newsletter like,

894
00:42:03,240 --> 00:42:09,240
you said George Lopez, but you meant George Lucas.

895
00:42:09,240 --> 00:42:10,680
That one was on Tommy.

896
00:42:10,680 --> 00:42:14,760
Tommy said that at 322 PM on Thursday.

897
00:42:14,760 --> 00:42:16,680
Star Wars would have been better, at least

898
00:42:16,680 --> 00:42:19,040
the first thing.

899
00:42:19,040 --> 00:42:22,240
I'm not convinced that Phantom Menace wasn't written

900
00:42:22,240 --> 00:42:25,160
and directed by George Lopez.

901
00:42:25,160 --> 00:42:27,480
Because you weren't fucking chortling the whole way

902
00:42:27,480 --> 00:42:28,680
through, that's how you know.

903
00:42:28,680 --> 00:42:31,160
Should you wait and collect this newsletter

904
00:42:31,160 --> 00:42:33,760
throughout a given day or week, or should it

905
00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:35,920
be like someone says something wrong, and you stand up

906
00:42:35,920 --> 00:42:38,960
and walk out of the room?

907
00:42:38,960 --> 00:42:40,440
Where's he going?

908
00:42:40,440 --> 00:42:41,920
He's going to his printing press.

909
00:42:41,920 --> 00:42:44,680
You said something stupid.

910
00:42:44,680 --> 00:42:47,200
He'll be back in just a moment.

911
00:42:47,200 --> 00:42:50,040
Or maybe there's, I don't know, maybe that's something

912
00:42:50,040 --> 00:42:51,640
you could use Facebook for, right?

913
00:42:51,640 --> 00:42:54,520
And tag everybody who said some wrong shit.

914
00:42:54,520 --> 00:42:58,440
No, it's a printing press or nothing.

915
00:42:58,440 --> 00:43:01,520
A handset type printing press.

916
00:43:01,520 --> 00:43:03,560
An old school Gutenberg.

917
00:43:03,560 --> 00:43:06,960
I want you to fucking mimeograph their mistakes

918
00:43:06,960 --> 00:43:09,760
and rub it in their faces with a purple ink.

919
00:43:09,760 --> 00:43:12,520
You need to come back out with like arm garters

920
00:43:12,520 --> 00:43:16,440
and an old-timey apron and your hands covered in ink

921
00:43:16,440 --> 00:43:19,240
and just say, yeah, I like all this.

922
00:43:19,240 --> 00:43:20,080
Here's your newsletter, stupid.

923
00:43:20,080 --> 00:43:21,720
Now, is this something we could charge for?

924
00:43:21,720 --> 00:43:23,880
Is this something that people would purchase?

925
00:43:23,880 --> 00:43:25,360
I think if I was wrong about something

926
00:43:25,360 --> 00:43:26,600
and someone wrote a newsletter about it,

927
00:43:26,600 --> 00:43:27,880
I probably would want to pay to read it.

928
00:43:27,880 --> 00:43:29,400
I would pay for that privilege.

929
00:43:31,720 --> 00:43:32,960
Gervin hit me with a Yahoo.

930
00:43:32,960 --> 00:43:34,960
I feel like we need to get another Yahoo in here

931
00:43:34,960 --> 00:43:36,500
before we wrap it up.

932
00:43:37,440 --> 00:43:38,280
Okay.

933
00:43:38,280 --> 00:43:41,200
We're probably going a bit long here, but so what?

934
00:43:41,200 --> 00:43:45,120
How about, you know, I've got two

935
00:43:45,120 --> 00:43:46,500
that I'm debating between, but I don't know

936
00:43:46,500 --> 00:43:47,680
that either of them will start

937
00:43:47,680 --> 00:43:48,980
a particularly good conversation.

938
00:43:48,980 --> 00:43:50,920
So what if I just did both of them

939
00:43:50,920 --> 00:43:53,840
and we just did like two minute, like sliders, right?

940
00:43:53,840 --> 00:43:54,680
Right, okay.

941
00:43:54,680 --> 00:43:56,080
I'm excited, okay.

942
00:43:56,080 --> 00:43:57,720
This one was sent in by Yahoo Answers,

943
00:43:57,720 --> 00:43:59,440
or by Wax Catharsis.

944
00:43:59,440 --> 00:44:00,680
Thank you, Wax Catharsis.

945
00:44:00,680 --> 00:44:04,100
It's by Yahoo Answers user Michelle H, who asks,

946
00:44:04,100 --> 00:44:07,600
I see these beautiful pictures of Vin Diesel on the net.

947
00:44:07,600 --> 00:44:11,560
However, when I try to find posters, dull, dull, dull.

948
00:44:11,560 --> 00:44:13,560
Where can I order a great Vin Diesel poster?

949
00:44:13,560 --> 00:44:16,280
Or is there a place that I can take a picture off the net

950
00:44:16,280 --> 00:44:18,200
and make it into a poster?

951
00:44:18,200 --> 00:44:19,760
No.

952
00:44:19,760 --> 00:44:24,760
If you go to my mbmbam.com and click the buy stuff link,

953
00:44:25,200 --> 00:44:28,680
we have a large selection of Vin Diesel posters

954
00:44:28,680 --> 00:44:29,520
that I think would be right up your alley.

955
00:44:29,520 --> 00:44:31,600
And not just Vin Diesel posters.

956
00:44:31,600 --> 00:44:33,040
I would say that these pictures,

957
00:44:33,040 --> 00:44:35,480
these high quality glossy JPEGs,

958
00:44:35,480 --> 00:44:38,160
these are beautiful pictures of Vin Diesel.

959
00:44:38,160 --> 00:44:40,960
Artistic, like should be in a museum.

960
00:44:40,960 --> 00:44:43,440
Botticelli-esque pictures of Vin,

961
00:44:43,440 --> 00:44:46,160
just this is a gorgeous piece of art that we got.

962
00:44:46,160 --> 00:44:48,200
You can tell that they're art

963
00:44:48,200 --> 00:44:51,720
because you can see a little pube, but not like all.

964
00:44:51,720 --> 00:44:55,380
Just a tasteful, like a really tasteful amount.

965
00:44:55,380 --> 00:44:57,640
A tasteful amount of Vin Diesel's pubes.

966
00:44:57,640 --> 00:44:59,440
And if that's not the name of this episode,

967
00:44:59,440 --> 00:45:00,600
I'll eat my hat.

968
00:45:00,600 --> 00:45:01,440
Oh.

969
00:45:06,560 --> 00:45:08,000
Here's the other one.

970
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:09,320
Because I feel like that one's pretty much cast.

971
00:45:09,320 --> 00:45:11,680
Oh, this one was also sent in by Wax Catharsis.

972
00:45:11,680 --> 00:45:13,440
This is our Wax Catharsis blog.

973
00:45:13,440 --> 00:45:18,440
Yahoo Answers user Zandra asks,

974
00:45:18,720 --> 00:45:21,640
is it okay to call a baby girl Pootie Tang?

975
00:45:21,640 --> 00:45:26,640
My cousin LaShawn calls her daughter Arianna Pootie Tang.

976
00:45:27,720 --> 00:45:30,560
I tell her that Pootie Tang is another word for pussy,

977
00:45:30,560 --> 00:45:33,120
but she thinks otherwise and still calls her that.

978
00:45:34,360 --> 00:45:36,640
No, it's a hilarious, hilarious movie.

979
00:45:36,640 --> 00:45:37,480
Yeah.

980
00:45:37,480 --> 00:45:39,580
They're saying you're a baby, you make me laugh

981
00:45:39,580 --> 00:45:41,340
and you're underappreciated.

982
00:45:41,340 --> 00:45:42,180
Is.

983
00:45:42,180 --> 00:45:43,520
And you're written by Louis C.K.

984
00:45:43,520 --> 00:45:45,640
I don't think there's anything wrong with that,

985
00:45:45,640 --> 00:45:48,780
but to be fair, I also don't think there's anything wrong

986
00:45:48,780 --> 00:45:51,520
with little Pootie Tang growing up and killing her mom.

987
00:45:51,520 --> 00:45:53,660
So, yeah, there's that.

988
00:45:53,660 --> 00:45:54,680
She'll have deserved it.

989
00:45:54,680 --> 00:45:55,520
Yeah.

990
00:45:55,520 --> 00:45:57,920
Like, has that, has the word Pootie Tang been adopted

991
00:45:57,920 --> 00:46:01,280
by the consciousness of the world to mean pussy?

992
00:46:01,280 --> 00:46:02,360
See, that's the thing.

993
00:46:02,360 --> 00:46:03,540
No.

994
00:46:03,540 --> 00:46:04,380
Yeah.

995
00:46:04,380 --> 00:46:05,620
No, yeah, it's not a thing.

996
00:46:05,620 --> 00:46:06,680
I've never said that.

997
00:46:06,680 --> 00:46:07,800
It's a movie.

998
00:46:08,640 --> 00:46:11,120
It's not slang for a vagina.

999
00:46:11,120 --> 00:46:15,040
Not only a movie, but a movie that's like 12 years old.

1000
00:46:15,040 --> 00:46:16,100
Yeah.

1001
00:46:16,100 --> 00:46:17,560
Yeah.

1002
00:46:17,560 --> 00:46:19,520
Yeah, I don't think you're right on this one,

1003
00:46:19,520 --> 00:46:21,520
Yahoo Answers, I'm glad you're listening

1004
00:46:21,520 --> 00:46:25,280
because I think, I may be wrong.

1005
00:46:25,280 --> 00:46:28,560
I frequently am, but I don't think Pootie Tang

1006
00:46:28,560 --> 00:46:30,160
is a name for a woman's vagina.

1007
00:46:31,160 --> 00:46:33,060
Let me take you aside here.

1008
00:46:33,060 --> 00:46:34,020
Come with me.

1009
00:46:34,020 --> 00:46:34,860
Let's leave the burning back fan club.

1010
00:46:34,860 --> 00:46:36,200
Let's dissect this word, right?

1011
00:46:36,200 --> 00:46:37,020
Okay.

1012
00:46:37,020 --> 00:46:39,080
Let's do this like, dictionary.com style.

1013
00:46:39,080 --> 00:46:39,920
Okay.

1014
00:46:39,920 --> 00:46:41,520
Pootie.

1015
00:46:41,520 --> 00:46:42,360
Uh-huh.

1016
00:46:42,360 --> 00:46:43,180
Pooh.

1017
00:46:43,180 --> 00:46:44,020
I mean, that obviously has some kind of.

1018
00:46:44,020 --> 00:46:45,120
That sounds like a fart.

1019
00:46:45,120 --> 00:46:50,120
It sounds like something rectal, right?

1020
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:52,460
Yeah, uh-huh, yeah.

1021
00:46:52,460 --> 00:46:54,160
And Tang.

1022
00:46:54,160 --> 00:46:56,060
Delicious, refreshing.

1023
00:46:56,060 --> 00:46:58,880
Also like, creepy 1970s.

1024
00:46:58,880 --> 00:46:59,880
Space-centric.

1025
00:46:59,880 --> 00:47:00,720
Yeah.

1026
00:47:00,720 --> 00:47:04,480
Creepy 1970s slang for vagina.

1027
00:47:04,480 --> 00:47:06,540
Okay, I guess.

1028
00:47:06,540 --> 00:47:09,240
There's a lot of things going on in this word.

1029
00:47:09,240 --> 00:47:11,760
So what you're saying is she's calling her daughter

1030
00:47:11,760 --> 00:47:13,280
farty vagina.

1031
00:47:13,280 --> 00:47:15,120
She's calling her daughter.

1032
00:47:15,120 --> 00:47:15,960
Yeah, like.

1033
00:47:15,960 --> 00:47:18,200
And if that's not the name of this episode.

1034
00:47:21,600 --> 00:47:22,440
I don't.

1035
00:47:22,440 --> 00:47:24,120
Or the name of my child.

1036
00:47:24,120 --> 00:47:25,760
Yeah, I will name my child Pootie Tang

1037
00:47:25,760 --> 00:47:28,120
and that will be their Christian name.

1038
00:47:28,120 --> 00:47:30,440
And I will raise them to celebrate the winter solstice.

1039
00:47:30,440 --> 00:47:32,620
Is there any other Saturday Night Live characters

1040
00:47:32,620 --> 00:47:33,920
that we can name?

1041
00:47:33,920 --> 00:47:35,600
Was Pootie Tang a Saturday Night Live?

1042
00:47:35,600 --> 00:47:36,420
No, sir.

1043
00:47:36,420 --> 00:47:37,260
It wasn't, was it?

1044
00:47:37,260 --> 00:47:39,000
I'm thinking of, no?

1045
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:39,920
Yeah, it was just a movie.

1046
00:47:39,920 --> 00:47:40,920
You're thinking of Mr. Bill,

1047
00:47:40,920 --> 00:47:43,000
another great product by Capcom Mobile.

1048
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:44,720
What about Ladies Man?

1049
00:47:45,640 --> 00:47:47,160
Ladies Man.

1050
00:47:47,160 --> 00:47:49,060
Undercover brother.

1051
00:47:49,060 --> 00:47:50,400
You guys are bigots.

1052
00:47:50,400 --> 00:47:53,760
I've been doing this show with bigots for years

1053
00:47:53,760 --> 00:47:54,720
and I had no idea.

1054
00:47:54,720 --> 00:47:57,920
I grew up, I was reared with two bigots.

1055
00:47:57,920 --> 00:47:59,840
No, no, no, okay, hold on.

1056
00:47:59,840 --> 00:48:03,440
I think my racial tolerance is an inspiration.

1057
00:48:03,440 --> 00:48:05,360
It's an inspiration, my racial tolerance.

1058
00:48:05,360 --> 00:48:06,880
That I was able to grow up in the same household

1059
00:48:06,880 --> 00:48:10,840
as you two bigots and still not see color

1060
00:48:10,840 --> 00:48:12,840
in the manner that I do is,

1061
00:48:12,840 --> 00:48:17,160
I don't think heroism is too strong of a word.

1062
00:48:17,160 --> 00:48:18,920
It may be too weak, actually.

1063
00:48:21,720 --> 00:48:24,400
So my brothers are bigots

1064
00:48:24,400 --> 00:48:26,880
and I don't wanna do this shit anymore with them.

1065
00:48:26,880 --> 00:48:29,240
Man, we can't wait to do that Christmas episode.

1066
00:48:29,240 --> 00:48:32,200
There's a lot of warmth in here.

1067
00:48:32,200 --> 00:48:33,040
There's a lot.

1068
00:48:33,040 --> 00:48:38,040
It will be the most racially charged Christmas episode yet.

1069
00:48:40,140 --> 00:48:41,880
Probably in history.

1070
00:48:41,880 --> 00:48:43,780
So this has been My Brother, My Brother, Me.

1071
00:48:43,780 --> 00:48:45,220
But before we wrap it up,

1072
00:48:45,220 --> 00:48:48,080
a couple quick housekeeping notes.

1073
00:48:48,080 --> 00:48:50,600
mbnbam.com is our website.

1074
00:48:50,600 --> 00:48:53,420
mbnbam is the name of our Twitter feed

1075
00:48:53,420 --> 00:48:54,680
if you wanna follow us there.

1076
00:48:54,680 --> 00:48:56,920
We're coming up on 2,000.

1077
00:48:58,040 --> 00:49:00,680
If you wanna order products from us,

1078
00:49:00,680 --> 00:49:03,240
we have t-shirts and hooded sweatshirts,

1079
00:49:03,240 --> 00:49:06,240
the proceeds from which go to Big Brothers, Big Sisters.

1080
00:49:06,240 --> 00:49:09,520
You can get those at mbnbam.com.

1081
00:49:09,520 --> 00:49:11,160
If you wanna get them by Christmas,

1082
00:49:11,160 --> 00:49:13,080
you need to order in the next week.

1083
00:49:14,080 --> 00:49:16,080
The 19th is the cutoff for those, I believe.

1084
00:49:16,080 --> 00:49:16,920
Is that right, Griffin?

1085
00:49:16,920 --> 00:49:17,740
18th or 19th?

1086
00:49:17,740 --> 00:49:18,580
I have no idea.

1087
00:49:18,580 --> 00:49:20,600
I do know that we only have a few sweatshirts left,

1088
00:49:20,600 --> 00:49:22,040
a few hoodies left.

1089
00:49:22,040 --> 00:49:22,880
Okay.

1090
00:49:22,880 --> 00:49:25,680
And we have raised, well, you guys,

1091
00:49:25,680 --> 00:49:26,800
we haven't done anything,

1092
00:49:26,800 --> 00:49:29,200
you guys have raised almost $500

1093
00:49:29,200 --> 00:49:30,200
for Big Brothers, Big Sisters,

1094
00:49:30,200 --> 00:49:32,360
which is amazing.

1095
00:49:32,360 --> 00:49:34,640
That's enough to buy a Big Brother, right?

1096
00:49:34,640 --> 00:49:36,080
Yeah, that is one Big Brother.

1097
00:49:37,040 --> 00:49:38,440
If you buy a couple more,

1098
00:49:38,440 --> 00:49:40,760
maybe we can get him some cool shades or something.

1099
00:49:40,760 --> 00:49:43,160
That's what Big Brothers are supposed to do.

1100
00:49:44,280 --> 00:49:47,920
So get on there, get the goods, get the merchandise.

1101
00:49:48,840 --> 00:49:53,600
We've got a Flash Magic 8-Ball

1102
00:49:53,600 --> 00:49:54,680
you can ask questions of.

1103
00:49:54,680 --> 00:49:57,520
We've got forums that are still super active,

1104
00:49:57,520 --> 00:50:00,440
lots of people talking about lots of crazy stuff on there.

1105
00:50:01,320 --> 00:50:05,100
And Griffin and me and Travis dip in from time to time.

1106
00:50:08,520 --> 00:50:10,260
If you want to play World of Warcraft with us,

1107
00:50:10,260 --> 00:50:11,660
all our login info is there,

1108
00:50:11,660 --> 00:50:13,520
so you can just come on over and say hi.

1109
00:50:13,520 --> 00:50:15,040
Give us some buffs.

1110
00:50:15,040 --> 00:50:15,880
God.

1111
00:50:17,040 --> 00:50:18,480
I'm so sad.

1112
00:50:18,480 --> 00:50:20,000
I know, I'm getting depressed too.

1113
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:21,060
Shit's real.

1114
00:50:21,060 --> 00:50:22,760
Shit's real, though.

1115
00:50:22,760 --> 00:50:23,760
Come get some buffs.

1116
00:50:25,160 --> 00:50:26,000
You got a buff?

1117
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:26,820
Come get me.

1118
00:50:26,820 --> 00:50:27,760
You got buffs.

1119
00:50:27,760 --> 00:50:29,520
And that's it.

1120
00:50:29,520 --> 00:50:31,040
We also have a voicemail, right?

1121
00:50:31,040 --> 00:50:34,380
Yeah, it's at 203-MA-BIM-BAM-1.

1122
00:50:34,380 --> 00:50:36,960
Yeah, call us and we don't play those on the show or anything

1123
00:50:36,960 --> 00:50:39,120
but we listen to them if you need us, we're there for you.

1124
00:50:39,120 --> 00:50:42,040
And all the ways to contact us are on the website.

1125
00:50:42,040 --> 00:50:45,240
You can also send in questions through the website.

1126
00:50:45,240 --> 00:50:47,360
It's all there, one stop shopping.

1127
00:50:47,360 --> 00:50:48,200
It's nice.

1128
00:50:48,200 --> 00:50:50,880
Yeah, and oh, we love it when people

1129
00:50:50,880 --> 00:50:52,640
put up quotes from the show.

1130
00:50:53,680 --> 00:50:56,700
Sometimes they ruin jokes, but that's okay.

1131
00:50:56,700 --> 00:50:58,080
I don't mind so much.

1132
00:50:58,080 --> 00:51:03,080
We got people spreading the word Oizilla, O-I-Z-I-L-L-A,

1133
00:51:04,760 --> 00:51:08,560
out there spreading the word Michael Maney, as always.

1134
00:51:08,560 --> 00:51:11,080
Yeah, some people put up some incredible fan art

1135
00:51:11,080 --> 00:51:12,300
for Bramblepelt.

1136
00:51:12,300 --> 00:51:15,160
Lot of people do, but thank you everybody

1137
00:51:15,160 --> 00:51:20,000
who submitted your Bramblepelt illustrations.

1138
00:51:22,060 --> 00:51:25,160
And that'll do it for us.

1139
00:51:25,160 --> 00:51:27,680
Also, just to reiterate, we have the comedy show,

1140
00:51:27,680 --> 00:51:30,120
the holiday show coming up, so yeah.

1141
00:51:30,120 --> 00:51:31,720
It will not be a comedy show.

1142
00:51:31,720 --> 00:51:33,120
No, it'll be super serious.

1143
00:51:33,120 --> 00:51:36,800
Fucking super dour, like tune in.

1144
00:51:36,800 --> 00:51:37,920
And racially charged.

1145
00:51:37,920 --> 00:51:39,840
Really racially charged.

1146
00:51:39,840 --> 00:51:42,520
That episode, unfortunately, is whites only, so.

1147
00:51:43,840 --> 00:51:45,280
We're calling it White Christmas.

1148
00:51:45,280 --> 00:51:48,280
It's called the Bim Bam's Christmas Show for White Kids.

1149
00:51:48,280 --> 00:51:49,600
Oh God.

1150
00:51:49,600 --> 00:51:52,600
Just kidding, anyone can get it.

1151
00:51:52,600 --> 00:51:54,760
Just kidding, anybody can listen.

1152
00:51:54,760 --> 00:51:57,760
Like we encourage whites to download it, but we can't.

1153
00:51:57,760 --> 00:51:58,600
We can't.

1154
00:51:58,600 --> 00:52:00,440
I would like to discourage white people

1155
00:52:00,440 --> 00:52:02,440
from listening after I get it.

1156
00:52:02,440 --> 00:52:06,320
So Griffin, we have one more question.

1157
00:52:06,320 --> 00:52:07,640
Why don't you hit me?

1158
00:52:07,640 --> 00:52:10,640
Okay, let's see.

1159
00:52:10,640 --> 00:52:13,840
This one was sent in by Jairus Mitchell.

1160
00:52:13,840 --> 00:52:15,160
Thank you, Jairus.

1161
00:52:15,160 --> 00:52:18,440
It's by Yahoo Answers user, Glow, who asks,

1162
00:52:19,840 --> 00:52:22,160
is tea just gay coffee?

1163
00:52:22,160 --> 00:52:26,200
I'm Justin McElroy.

1164
00:52:26,200 --> 00:52:27,040
Travis McElroy.

1165
00:52:27,040 --> 00:52:28,360
I'm Griffin McElroy.

1166
00:52:28,360 --> 00:52:30,320
This has been my brother, my brother and me.

1167
00:52:30,320 --> 00:52:31,440
Kiss your dad.

1168
00:52:31,440 --> 00:52:33,520
Square on the lips.

1169
00:52:37,520 --> 00:52:39,600
Keep your heart three steps away.

1170
00:52:39,600 --> 00:52:41,600
I'm not gonna lie, I'm not gonna lie.

1171
00:52:41,600 --> 00:52:42,920
I'm not gonna lie.

1172
00:52:42,920 --> 00:52:45,560
Keep your heart three steps.

1173
00:52:45,560 --> 00:52:46,600
Keep your heart.

1174
00:52:46,600 --> 00:52:48,720
Hey, keep your heart three steps.

1175
00:52:48,720 --> 00:52:49,720
Keep your heart.

1176
00:52:49,720 --> 00:52:51,080
Man, these girls are smart.

1177
00:52:51,080 --> 00:52:53,440
Three steps, these girls are smart.

1178
00:52:53,440 --> 00:53:20,440
Play your part.
