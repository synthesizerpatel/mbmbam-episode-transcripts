1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:30,800
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:46,880
Hello, everybody, and welcome to My Brother, My Brother, Me,

6
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:50,560
an Advice Show for the Modron Era. I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy.

7
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:53,440
I'm your middle-est brother, Travis McElroy.

8
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:55,760
And I'm your sweet baby brother, Griffin McElroy.

9
00:00:55,760 --> 00:01:00,960
My, my, my, is that the Piper?

10
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:04,800
He's back, and I know that- real quick, guys, we should've talked about this before we started

11
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:07,200
recording. I know this is gonna be our super chill Certamax fun drive.

12
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:10,160
It's going for four weeks, but I thought we could go, like, this first week,

13
00:01:10,160 --> 00:01:11,760
like, pretty fucking heavy on it.

14
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:13,600
It's me, the Piper!

15
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:15,440
Yeah, exactly that type of energy. I love it.

16
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:17,120
I am the Piper!

17
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:18,000
Yeah, and-

18
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,760
It's I. The bill has come due, respectfully.

19
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:24,560
It's unbelievable to me that you would not know this at this point,

20
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:28,480
but we are a part of the Maximum Fun Network, which is artist-owned.

21
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:31,200
That's right, we're artists and supported.

22
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:34,880
If you take one thing away from the day, let it be that.

23
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:35,680
We are artists.

24
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:39,120
This podcast is just as good as a painting or photograph.

25
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:43,760
But more importantly, we're audience-supported, so we are asking over the next few weeks that

26
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:47,360
you become a member of the Maximum Fun family.

27
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:51,680
Just head on over to maximumfun.org forward slash donate.

28
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:54,720
You can choose a monthly amount that's comfortable for you.

29
00:01:54,720 --> 00:02:01,600
A lot of people do five or ten bucks a month, and some even go as high as 20 or 35 or $100.

30
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:07,280
Or there's one insane person that pledged $100,000 for a single night with me,

31
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:10,000
but I said, no, I shan't.

32
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:15,520
This is a way that you can support the shows of the network and say that I like this.

33
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:17,200
You help to make these shows happen.

34
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:21,040
You're the reason that we can, like, do them as regularly as we can.

35
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:26,640
And, you know, just to be quite honest with you, things have been weird for you.

36
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:27,680
We absolutely get that.

37
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:29,200
They've been weird for us, too.

38
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:33,440
We had to cancel a lot of live shows and book tours and stuff like that.

39
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:36,160
The stuff that makes our business a business.

40
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:40,560
And now we come to you hat in hand with Fallon, like Icarus,

41
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:44,160
to just begging for your scraps.

42
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:49,360
So please toss some scraps our way at maximumfun.org forward slash donate.

43
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:50,720
That was a chill vibe.

44
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:51,680
That vibe was pretty chill.

45
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:53,920
There's rewards and there's stuff you get and everything.

46
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:57,920
Yeah, you get gifts, but the gift is knowing that you're part of the family.

47
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:58,720
Yeah, the family.

48
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:02,000
Yeah, we'll talk a little bit more about it later on.

49
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:08,240
I promise we're not going to do the usual extended chats that we usually do during the

50
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:09,760
Max Fun Drive, but yeah.

51
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:10,160
Should we-

52
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:11,120
Brief chats.

53
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:14,880
A brief sort of sermon or lecture, even.

54
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:15,680
Does it sound good?

55
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:18,240
Juice, you want to kick us off with a little question?

56
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:22,480
We should start with riddle me this boys.

57
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:25,200
We can't say, hey guys, it would be cool to give us money.

58
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:27,600
And then Travis is like, and here's what you get for the money.

59
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:29,920
And then he throws up all over you and your hair.

60
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:35,760
Riddle me this boys, riddle me this.

61
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:36,160
Okay.

62
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:43,840
I took the money that people donate to the Max Fun Network and I paid composer Michael

63
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:49,040
Giacchino to write me a kind of like opener.

64
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:51,680
I paid him $150,000 for that.

65
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:54,400
Well, that was too much money for a bad song.

66
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:55,120
Oh, damn it.

67
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:58,160
Okay, well, we've got two here.

68
00:03:58,160 --> 00:03:58,480
Okay.

69
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:00,320
Wow.

70
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:04,160
One is just a quick one and another one's a real brain scratcher.

71
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:04,480
Okay.

72
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:07,200
So Hazel sent this one.

73
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:10,720
Well, and let me be clear, fair to Hazel.

74
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:13,200
This was not Hazel's question, mind you.

75
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:14,480
We know Hazel found this.

76
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:14,720
Okay.

77
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:18,080
There was a huge painting in an art museum.

78
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:23,040
Everyone looks at it more than the quote Mona Lisa in quote.

79
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:25,280
Why is that?

80
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:26,480
Why did it need to be?

81
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:26,720
Okay.

82
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:29,680
Yet the painter is not famous.

83
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:30,160
Why?

84
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:32,800
Is it the map to the museum?

85
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:35,120
A good guess, but no.

86
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:36,960
Because it's the map.

87
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:39,840
I said the map.

88
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:42,160
Yeah, but I said it with confidence.

89
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:42,960
Oh, I like that.

90
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:43,680
Yes.

91
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:46,880
No, the answer is the huge painting was the wall.

92
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:50,000
And then this is why I really enjoyed this.

93
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,800
No one is usually famous for painting a wall.

94
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:55,120
Well, is it a pain?

95
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:56,720
Is that a pain?

96
00:04:56,720 --> 00:05:02,560
If I paint my den cream eggshell off white and at the end of I'm like,

97
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:04,720
look, what do you think of my new piece?

98
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:05,440
Mm-hmm.

99
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:07,600
What do you think I'm saying with this new piece?

100
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:12,640
The Sistine Chapel was originally just a sort of nice beige color all over.

101
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:15,120
But then he spilled a bunch of fucking paint upwards

102
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:17,760
and it just so happened to make a pretty cool lord.

103
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:18,880
This is my piece.

104
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:22,240
This is my piece that I did when I originally painted the roof of the Sistine Chapel.

105
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:25,280
The Sistine Chapel?

106
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:27,280
Well, it was the 16th one they built.

107
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:27,760
Yeah, sure.

108
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:31,840
I would also argue, folks,

109
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:34,480
that a lot of people have gotten famous for painting walls.

110
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:35,840
Banksy for one.

111
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:37,760
Banksy's pretty well known for painting on walls.

112
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:41,440
Yeah, that is true.

113
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:45,280
Banksy doesn't just take a pan and a roller and try out.

114
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:47,760
I went for kind of a lavender with this one.

115
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:51,360
Do you feel like Banksy right now is getting halfway through something

116
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:53,440
and then something else even wilder happens?

117
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:54,720
He's like, well, damn it.

118
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:57,040
Guess I gotta go do a Banksy about that now.

119
00:05:57,040 --> 00:06:00,880
I bet the best part about being Banksy is half the time you didn't do it,

120
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:02,400
but you can be like, that was me.

121
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:03,920
But you can't be like, that was me,

122
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:05,600
because then that would have ruined the whole thing.

123
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:08,160
Okay, we got one more here and this one-

124
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:09,200
Just one?

125
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:10,000
I know.

126
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,640
This one is really gonna twist your noodle.

127
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:17,760
What came out from one hole and goes into two holes?

128
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:20,160
Jesus.

129
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:21,120
Is the answer gross?

130
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:22,160
Can you tell us the answer?

131
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:23,200
The answer is gross.

132
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:24,480
The answer is puerile.

133
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:26,080
Is it pee pee?

134
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:27,600
No.

135
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:28,320
A tongue?

136
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:31,200
No, the answer is farts.

137
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:37,120
And it took me a long time to figure out what the two holes they were referring to was.

138
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:41,120
There's so many holes it goes in.

139
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:46,000
You can't just say, you can't definitively say it goes into two holes.

140
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:47,920
I'm looking around my room right now.

141
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:49,840
There's a few, there's like power outlets.

142
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:52,720
That's three holes per outlet.

143
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:54,560
Like you can't tell me it doesn't go in there.

144
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:55,280
And that's gross.

145
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:57,280
And I don't want it to be in the show,

146
00:06:57,280 --> 00:07:01,520
but like there's a ceiling vent that has so many holes in it.

147
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:03,600
Wait, whenever the power goes out in my house,

148
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:05,200
the electricity never comes over and it's like,

149
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:07,520
well, it's cause so many farts went into the plugs.

150
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:08,480
It's so crazy.

151
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:11,680
All your electric pipes got clogged up with farts.

152
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:15,040
It's like my body even has more than two holes in it.

153
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:17,840
And you can't tell me that it doesn't go back in a little bit.

154
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:18,640
Do you know what I mean?

155
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:21,040
Like this is a, this sucks.

156
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:24,240
They soak it in the electrical wiring.

157
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:28,400
Think about Ghost Rider has to travel along those to get from room to room.

158
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:29,360
Oh no.

159
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:33,440
Hey, do you think Ghost Rider when a kid farted was ever like, it was Tommy?

160
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:36,560
Like, he was just like, I absolutely, I'm a ghost.

161
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:37,520
I know exactly who did it.

162
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:39,920
I can smell the farts on my wavelength.

163
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:44,480
Or made it spell it like automata poetically, like behind their butt.

164
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:45,520
And they're like, oh, come on.

165
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:45,840
Rap.

166
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:46,880
Yeah.

167
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:47,840
Oh, don't.

168
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:48,400
Oh man.

169
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:53,600
I was just sitting here reading my high and lowest cartoon

170
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:55,440
and you took the words out of high and low.

171
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:57,520
So it said rap behind my buttocks.

172
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:58,400
Right behind my butt.

173
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:02,000
And he can even do that even if you didn't rip.

174
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:02,960
Yep.

175
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:03,360
Oh yeah.

176
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:03,920
Yeah.

177
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:04,400
Just like.

178
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:05,280
It's Ghost Rider's whole thing.

179
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:07,120
Sometimes Ghost Rider just has beef.

180
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:08,240
Just wants to embarrass you.

181
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:09,280
You're like, hey, okay.

182
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:11,120
I'm sorry I didn't come to your birthday party.

183
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:11,840
You're a ghost.

184
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:13,760
Now can we do?

185
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:15,520
Yes.

186
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:16,480
Yeah, I'd like that.

187
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:17,600
I really would.

188
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:20,000
I know it would be nice just to spend some time with my brothers.

189
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:23,360
I just met a cute girl.

190
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:27,440
Within five minutes of conversation, I told her I was going to visit some friends across the state

191
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:28,960
about a three hour drive.

192
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:31,840
She exclaims that her father opened a pizza shop in that area.

193
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:33,120
She asked for my number.

194
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:35,680
I'm instructed to tell her father that she sent me.

195
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:38,320
I will likely receive free pizza.

196
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:42,720
Do I get pizza from this girl's father or is it too early to meet her parents?

197
00:08:44,160 --> 00:08:45,360
What a wild.

198
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:47,360
Hey, Vicky sent me.

199
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:50,160
Excuse me.

200
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:50,720
Excuse me.

201
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,200
Pepperoni and Vicky.

202
00:08:57,280 --> 00:08:58,080
Who is Vicky?

203
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:00,720
Who is Vicky?

204
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:01,760
Is there an owner here?

205
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:03,360
Is the owner?

206
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:05,040
Can I talk to the owner?

207
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:06,160
Is the dad here?

208
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:06,720
Is daddy here?

209
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:08,320
Is that Vicky's dad?

210
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:09,360
I'm looking for daddy.

211
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:12,400
Who made Vicky?

212
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:14,320
Who made Vicky here?

213
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:18,080
I'll have a large pepperoni and one Vicky's dad, please.

214
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:27,920
What size, shape, and organization of pie would you order when your plan to pay for

215
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:30,000
it is I know Vicky?

216
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:34,080
You got to go small, right?

217
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:37,840
It's got to be small, personal pan, single topping.

218
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:40,400
I don't want to be a bother, but I do know Vicky.

219
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:45,120
And I am trying to get with her right now.

220
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:46,880
Right now, don't worry about that, daddy.

221
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:47,760
Can I call you daddy?

222
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:54,080
Right now, can I say, hungry and confused in Ohio, there's one word in this entire

223
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:57,040
question that maybe is the one that trips me up the most.

224
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:57,840
I know it.

225
00:09:57,840 --> 00:09:58,320
I know this word.

226
00:09:58,320 --> 00:09:59,360
It is likely.

227
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:00,560
Yes, this is the word.

228
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:01,920
Yes, the word likely.

229
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:10,080
If Vicky herself cannot give you the Vicky guarantee that this plan is going to pan out,

230
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:10,560
there is no-

231
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:11,760
Personal pan out.

232
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:12,400
Personal pan out.

233
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:15,040
There is no fucking way you can try and execute it.

234
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:16,720
Because there's the chance that this happens.

235
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:18,640
I'll have one pizza, please.

236
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:20,720
And also Vicky sent me, okay?

237
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:24,800
I don't have any money.

238
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:28,000
Joke's on you, I don't like Vicky.

239
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:31,680
That is, that will cost you $100.

240
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:35,840
Vicky is my worst child, by far.

241
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:38,960
Because she keeps giving away free pizzas.

242
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:40,560
I am a small business owner.

243
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:45,040
I've just recently opened this establishment and everyone Vicky talks to for five minutes

244
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:49,200
sends them three hours my way to get one free pizza.

245
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:53,120
I'm giving away pies here because of those loose Vicky lips.

246
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:58,880
I think it's probably more likely that Vicky's trying to drum up business for her dad's pizza.

247
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:00,240
Like, doesn't that make more sense?

248
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:01,600
Like, my dad makes good pizza.

249
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:03,920
Go see him to have the pizza.

250
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:07,600
Vicky gets 10% of everything for a referral fee.

251
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:08,100
Yeah.

252
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:14,240
The worst response you could get, I think, is Vicky.

253
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:19,360
Why, Vicky died 75 years ago this very night.

254
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:22,960
There hasn't been a Vicky here for 75 years.

255
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:27,280
And also, to be fair, I died 80 years ago tonight.

256
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:31,680
So, do you want some ghost-a-roni on your ghost pizza?

257
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:33,600
Thank you for coming to our theme.

258
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:34,560
Some scaranera.

259
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:36,640
Some scaranera sauce.

260
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:42,720
Oh God, the fucking crypt keeper has entered.

261
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:45,360
Ashes to ashes, crust to crust.

262
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:47,920
Here, have a little mush gloom.

263
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:54,320
And maybe a side of pain apples.

264
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:05,440
I will say that if you go to this pizza store owner and drop Vicky's name and say that she

265
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:11,360
said you could get some free pizza and he says Vicky died 75 years ago, I think you

266
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:15,440
could make a pretty sound argument that you should super get the pizza now.

267
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:17,520
Yeah, it sounds like Vicky's unfinished business.

268
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:23,360
Vicky's ghost or angel came to you in a vision and told you, be not afraid.

269
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:26,880
Go visit my dad or grandson.

270
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:29,760
I'm not entirely sure what unclear what it is.

271
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:32,080
And get this zah.

272
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:35,440
So that I can finally rest.

273
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:39,120
So that I may die and pass on into oblivion.

274
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:40,640
Here's a Yahoo.

275
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:41,520
Can I read it?

276
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:42,720
Can you do it?

277
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:45,120
This one was sent in by Graham Roebuck.

278
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:46,000
Thank you, Graham.

279
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,680
Graham crushed it this week.

280
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:50,000
Really did not fake the funk.

281
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:56,240
It's asked by Yahoo Answers user Felix who asks, in food and drink, beer, wine, and spirits

282
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:56,640
category.

283
00:12:56,640 --> 00:13:02,240
So that's like this is one of the rare times where they actually have selected a very appropriate

284
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:02,800
category.

285
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:08,080
Felix asks, which years are the good wine years?

286
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:14,000
I've only had ever a couple sips of wine in my life, but I always hear people who are wine

287
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,880
experts saying stuff like, that was a good year.

288
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:19,920
I want to sound like I know what I'm talking about if someone ever offers me wine.

289
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:22,960
So I was wondering if anyone knows what all the good wine years are.

290
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:27,680
And I am just now realizing, fam, that we did do a question last week about how to sound

291
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:29,200
like you know what beer is like.

292
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:32,400
So this is sort of a sequel, like a squequel to that.

293
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:33,680
And that was unintentional.

294
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:41,120
But I don't, people who like know a lot of different sort of like wines and vineyards,

295
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:45,440
that in and of itself is sort of like remarkable.

296
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:49,120
I mean, I know upwards of 300 Pokemon, so maybe it's just like a different way that

297
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:53,040
we have prioritized spending our memory storage.

298
00:13:53,040 --> 00:14:00,160
But the people who can be like, ah, the Fibonacci vineyard, that was a good one.

299
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:07,120
And also in 2003, 2007, 2009, their grapes were dope.

300
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:08,480
Like, how do you do that?

301
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:10,720
That seems like they're making shit up.

302
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:11,920
Griffin, they are.

303
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:19,120
That is what it all boils down to, is like so much of that is uncheckable.

304
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:26,400
If I say, ah, a delicious, this Dreaming Tree Zinfandel from the vineyards of Dave Matthews.

305
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:26,720
Yeah.

306
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:29,200
Ah, delicious, 1998, what a good year.

307
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:30,160
What are you going to do?

308
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:35,920
Google, was 1998 a good year for Dave Matthews Zinfandel wine?

309
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:38,800
What year did Dave Matthews make the best wine?

310
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:43,840
Right, but like, Google that right now, Griffin, and watch your computer explode.

311
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:50,000
Well, I got what year did Dave, and it filled in what year did Dave Thomas die, and I got sad.

312
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:50,800
Oh, no.

313
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:53,360
So thank you, that's why I stopped, I stopped.

314
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:58,320
I'm saying there is no, like, even then, if someone was like, well, that wasn't a good year,

315
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:01,760
and you're like, it was for this bottle, okay, cool.

316
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:03,440
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

317
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:04,880
Good, it got me.

318
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:05,680
Just got me.

319
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:10,800
The good year, what you can fake is the good years differ by region.

320
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:13,360
So if you're like, is it 2012?

321
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:14,560
That sounds very good.

322
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:16,400
They'll be like, no, it's not good.

323
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:18,320
You're like, oh, I didn't, is that Napa?

324
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:19,280
My mistake, sorry.

325
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:20,560
Ah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

326
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:24,240
Sorry, I tend to stay in Tuscany.

327
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:32,400
If you want me to take a soldier on state side, I suppose I could sully my palate.

328
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:35,520
I suppose I could sully my palate.

329
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:39,360
You could also just go safe and just always say, like, that was an average year for wine.

330
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:42,000
Oh, okay, yeah, that was fine.

331
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,800
That was not my, not my favorite year for wine.

332
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:46,320
But not the worst.

333
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:52,640
If someone brings out 69, you can say, oh, nice.

334
00:15:52,640 --> 00:15:53,120
Yeah.

335
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:58,160
And then if they're like, actually, it's pretty bad, you'd say, oh, no, I was actually

336
00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:02,800
remarking on the fact that you said 69, I was just trying to support you because you said 69.

337
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:06,560
That also works if someone brings out a wine from the year 420.

338
00:16:07,280 --> 00:16:08,240
Then you can be like, ah.

339
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:13,760
What a dank blend this is.

340
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:15,680
I can't wait to drink that and die.

341
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:19,120
I mean, would you?

342
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:20,820
Die?

343
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:23,200
It probably wouldn't be very good.

344
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:25,520
No, it's corked.

345
00:16:25,520 --> 00:16:27,040
That's corked for sure.

346
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:28,400
This one's corked.

347
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:29,280
This is corked.

348
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:30,800
That one's going to need to be decanted.

349
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:35,440
It's got, it's got ancient viral streams in it.

350
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:37,520
Okay, they hand you the, they hand you the bottle.

351
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:41,840
You look at the year, you say, oh, you waited too long.

352
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:43,360
This is vinegar now.

353
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:46,160
And then you up in the bottle and dump it on the ground.

354
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:49,200
And then no one can check if you're right or not.

355
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:51,280
They're just going to assume that you knew what you were doing.

356
00:16:51,280 --> 00:16:55,360
Just chuck the unopened bottle through the nearest plate glass window.

357
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:57,120
And when they're like, you broke my home.

358
00:16:57,120 --> 00:17:00,720
You say, no, you broke my evening with this vinegar wine.

359
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:01,280
With this vinegar.

360
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:03,360
You brought vinegar to our home.

361
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:04,480
I have another idea.

362
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:05,760
This is very good.

363
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:07,840
You get the bottle, you inspect the year.

364
00:17:07,840 --> 00:17:11,840
You say, ah, 2001, a delightful vintage.

365
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:13,360
May I saber it?

366
00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:22,720
And then you just smash it to pieces.

367
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:27,040
Repeat until only beer is left.

368
00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:29,280
Repeat until there are only boxes left.

369
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:31,440
And then everybody could agree on the quality of those.

370
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:34,640
Justin, if I may, another suggestion.

371
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:38,320
They hand it to you, you say, ah, 2001, an excellent christening wine.

372
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:42,320
Then you like smash it on the nearest ship or a vessel or whatever.

373
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:42,800
What have you.

374
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:45,120
That's good.

375
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:48,400
You could also just say like, ah, what year is this from?

376
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:50,960
2009, a fantastic year.

377
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:53,920
And they'll be like, actually, it was a bad year for this vineyard.

378
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:58,560
And you would say, I meant, generally speaking, for me.

379
00:17:58,560 --> 00:18:00,320
I had a fucking avatar.

380
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:02,240
Kick ass, dude.

381
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:03,280
Loved it.

382
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:04,720
Did you see the avatar?

383
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:08,240
I had a great make out sesh with someone I had a crush on.

384
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:09,440
It was a fine year.

385
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,960
My pubes finally blossomed.

386
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:14,640
It was excellent.

387
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:16,240
An excellent year.

388
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:18,080
Family guy.

389
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:21,840
Terrific season.

390
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:25,280
Speaking of years, it's this time of year.

391
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:26,160
Well, actually, it's not.

392
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:26,960
Damn it.

393
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:28,800
It's not even this time of year, is it?

394
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:29,120
No.

395
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:30,160
It's Max Fun Drive.

396
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:32,080
And there's some amazing gifts I want to tell you about.

397
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:35,040
And let me tell you, it's like, can I give them the URL first?

398
00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:36,880
And he's like, please, you don't need to convince me.

399
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:39,600
It's maximumfun.org forward slash donate.

400
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:43,040
Please just beat Travis to the punch and just go there right now.

401
00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:43,360
Yeah.

402
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:46,800
Because if he tells you about the gifts, if you donate right now,

403
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:50,480
now, then you can always know you did it with a purity of spirit.

404
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:52,800
If you wait until my brother tells you the gifts,

405
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:56,240
then you're going to have to always carry around that question.

406
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:57,200
Why did I do it?

407
00:18:57,200 --> 00:19:00,160
Did I just do it for the things or for the love, you know?

408
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:01,680
So true.

409
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:05,920
So it's the first one, right off the bat, the best one, as far as I'm concerned,

410
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:08,800
for $5 a month.

411
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:14,160
$5 gets you exclusive members only bonus content.

412
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:15,440
And not just from this year.

413
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:20,080
From every Max Fun Drive, every piece of bonus content up till now.

414
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:23,760
It's like over 200 hours of bonus content.

415
00:19:24,560 --> 00:19:26,880
And there's some really incredible stuff in there.

416
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:28,240
And I'm not just saying it.

417
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:32,160
One of the ones I'm most excited about is on the Adventure Zone.

418
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:38,960
We played D&D, me, Justin, Griffin, and Dad with Matt Mercer DMing

419
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:43,120
with like all new characters, all new story, all of Matt's creation.

420
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:44,880
It was so much fun.

421
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:48,000
And I think it's one of the few times, aside from, I think, Dadlands,

422
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:51,120
where the four of us got to like actually all play together.

423
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:51,760
Yeah.

424
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:53,440
It was an absolute blast.

425
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:53,920
Check that out.

426
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:55,120
There's a ton of stuff there.

427
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:57,120
For $10 a month, you get the bonus content.

428
00:19:57,120 --> 00:20:00,080
Plus, you get an enamel pin.

429
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:02,000
It's a Max Fun Drive exclusive enamel pin.

430
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,600
And there's one for each show.

431
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:05,520
This has been a hit every year.

432
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:06,880
They're absolutely gorgeous.

433
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:08,720
They're designed by Megan Lynn Cott.

434
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:11,120
And they're gorgeous.

435
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:13,680
If you've ever seen a cool Max Fun pin,

436
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:15,120
it's probably one of the drive pins.

437
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:17,360
And you get to pick whichever one you want.

438
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:19,280
And you get a membership card.

439
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:21,040
So for $20, you get the pin.

440
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:22,000
You get the membership card.

441
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,240
You get the over 200 hours of bonus content.

442
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:29,600
And you get a Max Fun game pack that includes Max Fun inspired playing cards

443
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:31,600
and all kinds of cool stuff.

444
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:32,800
Dice, dice back.

445
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:35,840
And then for $35, you get the Max Fun game kit.

446
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:38,640
You get the pin, the membership card, all the bonus content,

447
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:42,240
and a Rocket Camp mug, which is frankly my favorite kind of mug.

448
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:45,120
Those kind of enamelly ones, you know, with the speckles.

449
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:46,400
Makes you look really cool.

450
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:50,000
And there's more, but you can go check those out.

451
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,320
One more time, Justin, give them that URL.

452
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:55,200
It's maximumfun.org forward slash join.

453
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:59,680
Also, we fully realize it's not a great time to be asking for money

454
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:03,280
because there's lots of very worthy causes to be giving to.

455
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:07,520
And we also know that a lot of people are not in a financial position

456
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:09,280
to become Max Fun members.

457
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:12,000
And we fully, fully, fully understand that.

458
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:17,360
We're just asking that if you are in a position to invest in this show,

459
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:18,720
in this network, in this community,

460
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:22,240
we really appreciate you sort of supporting our ability

461
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:23,600
to continue to make these shows.

462
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:27,840
Which, you know, now that we aren't touring or doing anything else,

463
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:32,560
like that's where we're earning our living right now.

464
00:21:32,560 --> 00:21:36,160
So yeah, go to maximumfun.org slash join.

465
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:37,680
Look at all the different ways you can give.

466
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:39,840
We really, really appreciate you.

467
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:43,040
And yeah, should we do something else?

468
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:44,080
Yeah.

469
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:44,400
Yes.

470
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:48,560
My wife and I recently moved into our first home together.

471
00:21:48,560 --> 00:21:49,120
My wife.

472
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:53,120
May I feel back?

473
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:59,360
I mean, like, I just asked people to consider becoming Max Fun members

474
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:00,240
and then I-

475
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:01,600
And then you fucked it up.

476
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:02,080
You know what?

477
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:03,920
Here's my solemn pledge.

478
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:06,720
No more, no more my wife.

479
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:12,240
I will become a recurring $100 a month member of our own network

480
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:14,640
if you stick to that promise.

481
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:19,920
No more my wife's 2020.

482
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:21,760
I can't promise 2021.

483
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:24,800
In five months, you're back on your bullshit.

484
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:25,040
Okay.

485
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:27,120
My wife and I.

486
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:33,200
And I.

487
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:35,120
Wow, Trev, good job.

488
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:35,600
Really good.

489
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:35,920
Thank you.

490
00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:38,000
And I recently moved into our first home together.

491
00:22:38,560 --> 00:22:40,720
Upon removing a ceiling tile in the basement,

492
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:45,920
an entire stack of the previous owner's porno VHS and DVDs

493
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:47,440
fell out of the ceiling and onto the floor.

494
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:48,000
What do we do?

495
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:53,040
Do we reach out to the previous owner to see if they want them back?

496
00:22:53,040 --> 00:22:54,880
That's from Surprised in Milwaukee.

497
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:56,160
Well, not that one.

498
00:22:56,160 --> 00:22:57,920
You've identified the worst possible solution.

499
00:22:57,920 --> 00:23:00,000
The one that you shouldn't do and it's good.

500
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,840
Weed that out because that's going to help us.

501
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:03,200
Hey, is this dog?

502
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:06,720
You used to live in one, two, three, five house street.

503
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:07,600
Cool, cool.

504
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:10,560
I got all your dirty skin, folks.

505
00:23:10,560 --> 00:23:15,360
You want me to just drop them off like loose in a pile on your front lawn or what?

506
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:20,480
I can arrange them into a fun shape like a butt on your lawn.

507
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:22,080
You do?

508
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:23,200
Huh?

509
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:24,640
You really do want that?

510
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:25,840
Okay.

511
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:28,160
You need that.

512
00:23:28,160 --> 00:23:29,840
Goodbye, sir.

513
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:31,760
You were waiting for me to find them.

514
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:34,880
That's how you get your kicks?

515
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:36,640
Oh my goodness gracious.

516
00:23:37,680 --> 00:23:39,040
You still live in the house.

517
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:41,600
I just haven't seen you.

518
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:42,800
Oh no.

519
00:23:45,040 --> 00:23:47,120
You're controlling my four-year-old.

520
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:48,960
You're possessing my four-year-old.

521
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:50,720
It's the worst.

522
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:52,400
That got weird.

523
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:53,760
It got so weird.

524
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:54,720
I didn't even see that coming.

525
00:23:55,280 --> 00:23:57,120
Yeah, you can't reach out to this person.

526
00:23:57,120 --> 00:23:57,360
No.

527
00:23:57,360 --> 00:24:07,040
Um, I would not, I would never shame anyone for sexual gratification, personal sexual gratification.

528
00:24:07,040 --> 00:24:13,600
But I do have to question, uh boy, time to have some good masturbating time.

529
00:24:14,160 --> 00:24:21,520
I better go get this, I better go get the stepladder so I can get my adult felt.

530
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:28,000
I have to place this gem into this divot in this staff and wait for the sun to shine in

531
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:32,000
through the basement window at exactly 12 PM.

532
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:37,280
I need to contact my brothers to get them to bring their safety deposit box keys down

533
00:24:37,280 --> 00:24:41,040
to the bank with me so we can unlock the drawer and I can-

534
00:24:41,040 --> 00:24:43,200
Where do you keep your porno?

535
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:45,600
The shrine of the silver monkey.

536
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:51,040
That is a wild-

537
00:24:51,040 --> 00:24:53,680
The temple guard comes out like, again, man?

538
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:56,720
Three times today.

539
00:24:56,720 --> 00:25:01,120
It's weird to think that you're so embarrassed of your pornography that you hide it in your

540
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:07,200
literal ceiling, but not so embarrassed that you mind people thinking you use a stepladder

541
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:08,240
four times a day.

542
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:08,720
Right.

543
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:10,240
Just scooting it back and forth.

544
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:14,880
What exactly has happened here is they hid it so good that they forgot.

545
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:15,600
They forgot.

546
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:25,200
And, you know, in many ways, they clearly have moved on with their lives because, like,

547
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:31,360
if they were needing that on a regular basis, they probably would have noticed by now, right?

548
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:33,920
It's not like they misplaced-

549
00:25:33,920 --> 00:25:37,440
Well, Trav, bud, here's a fact from me to you.

550
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:42,800
They guarantee they noticed 15 minutes after they left the house, but there is no remedy

551
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:44,880
for this situation from their perspective, right?

552
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:45,520
That is fair.

553
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:49,840
They can't be like, you know, I think I forgot some stuff.

554
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:55,280
I just need to get into the basement and into the ceiling of the basement, please.

555
00:25:55,280 --> 00:26:02,320
I mean, another possibility here, it's funny, I learned while doing Wonderful last week

556
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:10,960
about votive hordes, which are treasure hordes that people would create, and the idea behind

557
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:15,920
a votive horde is that it is not intended to be recovered by that person.

558
00:26:15,920 --> 00:26:22,000
It is a purposeful abandonment of those items, usually for sort of ritual practices.

559
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:23,360
Maybe that's what it is.

560
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:29,280
They have all these porno tapes and DVDs, and they hovered them over the garbage can.

561
00:26:29,280 --> 00:26:30,560
And tintypes.

562
00:26:30,560 --> 00:26:33,760
And tintypes, yes, and kinetoscopes or whatever.

563
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:36,880
They had an old Nickelodeon that you could-

564
00:26:37,920 --> 00:26:40,320
This is like sexy as wax cylinder.

565
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:45,280
Yes, and they held them over the garbage can, and they just thought, friends, we've had

566
00:26:45,280 --> 00:26:51,280
so many great times cranking to you, and I can't throw you in the garbage, but I can't

567
00:26:51,280 --> 00:26:52,320
put you in the river.

568
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:54,960
What if fish see you?

569
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:58,720
What if fish see you and get horny for people?

570
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:00,800
I don't know how that would even work.

571
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:06,080
Garbage volcano is a super good idea, but it hasn't been invented yet, so I guess I

572
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:08,640
gotta put you in the ceiling of the basement forever.

573
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:11,440
It's my favorite scene in Incredible Mr. Limpet when he's like,

574
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:13,120
Oh yeah, skin fleas!

575
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:14,160
Oh boy!

576
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:16,400
Somebody dumped a big bag of porno!

577
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:18,480
Do you guys ever think about pirates-

578
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:19,680
The Incredible Mr. Limpet?

579
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:20,000
Yeah, we-

580
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,800
Do you judge by the content of this show constantly?

581
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:27,520
Yes, but pirates, do you think like when they bury their gold, and then like two days later

582
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:29,360
they're at the store and they're like, fuck!

583
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:31,600
I do want to buy the shit!

584
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:32,800
Everybody back on the boat!

585
00:27:33,680 --> 00:27:38,480
And I guess the bigger question is if Mr. Incredible Mr. Limpet does see human pornography

586
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:41,120
if he becomes the Incredible Mr. Stiff It.

587
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:42,480
And that's a funny joke.

588
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:44,800
And folks, and folks, that's a funny one.

589
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:48,800
That's one you can take out on the road.

590
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:51,040
Take that one out on tour.

591
00:27:51,040 --> 00:27:53,040
You really spin the wheels on that one.

592
00:27:53,040 --> 00:27:54,560
Give it some time to breathe.

593
00:27:54,560 --> 00:27:56,320
Everyone's gonna enjoy that one.

594
00:27:56,320 --> 00:27:57,440
Let it aerate a bit.

595
00:27:57,440 --> 00:28:09,840
Hey, let's do a quick tip, a quick splash in the soothing waters of the Money Zone.

596
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:19,600
During these quarantine times, it can be tough to add a little variety to your life.

597
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:23,440
Let me recommend DoorDash.

598
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:28,640
It's an app you get on your phone and then you look for the kind of cuisine that you'd

599
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:33,680
like to eat, all local places, and you order what you want and they bring it to you.

600
00:28:33,680 --> 00:28:35,840
It's just as easy as that.

601
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:40,320
And maybe there's a new place to open up and you're like, hey, they're on DoorDash.

602
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:41,600
I'm gonna give them a try.

603
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:45,440
That's a great way to try new food, add a little variety, something new to talk about.

604
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:48,960
Food you're craving right now, right to your door.

605
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:56,000
I have been using DoorDash, not an exaggeration, at least four times a week, maybe five, maybe

606
00:28:56,000 --> 00:29:04,320
more, a lot to keep my family fed like some sort of brave hunter-gatherer in these times.

607
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:08,160
And it is such a smooth service.

608
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:13,360
So rarely are there hiccups and when there are, they are so quick and responsive to fix

609
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:14,320
any problems that you have.

610
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:15,600
It's a wonderful service.

611
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:20,320
Right now, our listeners can get $5 off their first order of $15 or more and zero delivery

612
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:24,000
fees for the first month when you download the DoorDash app and enter code BROTHER.

613
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:30,400
That's $5 off your first order and zero delivery fees for a month when you download the DoorDash

614
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:33,600
app in the App Store and enter code BROTHER.

615
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:37,280
Don't forget, that's code BROTHER for $5 off your first order with DoorDash.

616
00:29:37,280 --> 00:29:38,320
Look around you.

617
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:39,600
One thing is missing.

618
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:40,560
It's a website.

619
00:29:40,560 --> 00:29:45,360
You do not have one and you need one because it's 2020 and you're not gonna get it.

620
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:50,800
And everything else is on fire, but the internet surprisingly still going strong.

621
00:29:50,800 --> 00:29:56,160

Stamps.

630
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:32,320
Gotta get them.

631
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:35,520
You need them, but you gotta stay away from crowds because of virus.

632
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:37,440
But what if you need to go to the post office?

633
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:40,480
What if you need posters to send out letters and packages?

634
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:44,400
Well, don't be a real silly goose because stamps.com is here to help.

637
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:53,520
You can use your computer to print official US postage, 24-7, any letter, any package,

638
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:55,120
any class mail, anywhere you want to send it.

639
00:30:55,120 --> 00:30:58,240
Once your mail is ready, you just leave it for your mail carrier or you schedule a free

640
00:30:58,240 --> 00:31:02,480
package pickup or you drop it in a freaking mailbox and you don't have to touch anyone,

641
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:03,200
anywhere.

642
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:04,000
It's that simple.

643
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,400

00:31:20,560 --> 00:31:24,000
Just go to stamps.com, click on the microphone at the top of the homepage and type in my

648
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:25,920
brother, all one word, that's stamps.com.

649
00:31:25,920 --> 00:31:27,120
Enter my brother.

650
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:29,280
Stay safe, my friends!

651
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:34,240
I started listening to Ono, Ross, and Carey shortly after I broke my arm and the doctor

652
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:36,320
had told me I'd never walk again.

653
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:37,840
I couldn't get my book started.

654
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:39,600
I was lost, honestly.

655
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:41,760
I knew it was time to make a change.

656
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:46,800
There's something about Ono, Ross, and Carey that you just can't get anywhere else.

657
00:31:46,800 --> 00:31:50,320
They're thought leaders, discoverers, founders.

658
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:51,680
I'd call them heroes.

659
00:31:51,680 --> 00:31:55,280
Ross and Carey don't just report on French science, spirituality, and claims of the

660
00:31:55,280 --> 00:31:56,240
paranormal.

661
00:31:56,240 --> 00:31:57,520
They take part themselves.

662
00:31:57,520 --> 00:32:00,000
They show up so you don't have to.

663
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,160
But you might find that you want to.

664
00:32:02,160 --> 00:32:03,840
My arm is better.

665
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:05,280
I can walk again.

666
00:32:05,280 --> 00:32:07,440
I wrote an entire book this weekend.

667
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:09,840
It's terrible, but I did it.

668
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:12,240
Just go to Maximumfun.org.

669
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:14,640
Thank you, Ross and Carey.

670
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:16,400
Ono, Ross, and Carey is just a podcast.

671
00:32:16,400 --> 00:32:17,120
It doesn't do anything.

672
00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:18,480
It's just sounds you listen to in your ears.

673
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:19,360
All these people are made up.

674
00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:19,920
Goodbye.

675
00:32:19,920 --> 00:32:33,360
Really crank it, go.

676
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:33,600
Okay.

677
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:36,160
Losing me.

678
00:32:37,520 --> 00:32:38,480
I want to munch.

679
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,080
I want to munch.

680
00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:51,040
That felt cathartic for all three of us.

681
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:55,280
Like we're all really working some shit out in that Munch Squad intro.

682
00:32:57,280 --> 00:32:58,160
Welcome to Munch Squad.

683
00:32:58,160 --> 00:33:03,200
It's a podcast within a podcast that features the latest and greatest in brand eating.

684
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:08,080
I am very hungry, which I hate doing during the Munch Squad, because it makes me feel

685
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:10,800
like I want to eat the things we talk about.

686
00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:12,480
It's a very dangerous place to be in.

687
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:17,440
I want to thank Nathaniel, because we got a Munch Squad retro.

688
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:24,960
We're going to hop in the DeLorean, if you will, and drive all the way back to 2001.

689
00:33:25,520 --> 00:33:27,600
A great year for wine.

690
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:30,880
A great year for wine, 2001, March 20th.

691
00:33:31,680 --> 00:33:36,560
Those halcyon days of the beginning of the millennium.

692
00:33:36,560 --> 00:33:48,000
Taco Bell is offering a free taco to everyone in the United States if the core of the Mir

693
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:52,640
Space Station hits a floating Taco Bell target placed in the South Pacific.

694
00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:53,680
What?

695
00:33:56,000 --> 00:34:02,720
Taco Bell is offering a free taco, you're with me so far, to everyone in the US if the

696
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:07,600
core of the Mir Space Station hits a floating Taco Bell target placed in the South Pacific.

697
00:34:08,160 --> 00:34:08,880
Huh.

698
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:09,680
Was that?

699
00:34:09,680 --> 00:34:10,240
Okay.

700
00:34:10,240 --> 00:34:15,920
I guess the context that I'm missing here is, was that something good?

701
00:34:15,920 --> 00:34:17,920
Did they like that that happened?

702
00:34:19,200 --> 00:34:23,840
Like did people want the core of the- or was this like a conciliatory like,

703
00:34:23,840 --> 00:34:27,360
listen, well, I'll be bummed out if the core of the Mir Space Station falls.

704
00:34:27,360 --> 00:34:34,400
But on the upside, if it hits the Taco Bell target, free tacos.

705
00:34:34,400 --> 00:34:39,840
There are 80 brave astronauts serving aboard the Mir Space Station right now, and that

706
00:34:39,840 --> 00:34:40,640
sucks.

707
00:34:40,640 --> 00:34:43,200
We hate what's about to happen to them.

708
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:52,480
But on the other hand, now I think it was a planned fall, but that does raise a question

709
00:34:52,480 --> 00:35:00,240
before I get further and press release, the question that I have is, if we didn't know

710
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:06,480
it was going to land on this Taco Bell target, does that mean we didn't know where it was

711
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:07,280
going to land?

712
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:09,280
I think that's exactly it, J-Man.

713
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:12,800
I mean, that is either, either option is wild.

714
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:17,120
Either Taco Bell knew exactly where the Mir Space Station was going to land to build a

715
00:35:17,120 --> 00:35:23,360
taco target there, or that no one knew and Taco Bell's like, well, if we aren't all

716
00:35:23,360 --> 00:35:34,720
eradicated, if fucking Delaware isn't blown off the map, the good news will be free tacos

717
00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:35,040
for everyone.

718
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:37,840
All remaining states get a taco party.

719
00:35:39,520 --> 00:35:43,040
It encompasses all of human experience, right?

720
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:51,520
At one end of the scale, the Mir satellite crashes into Las Cruces and wipes out millions.

721
00:35:51,520 --> 00:35:54,160
On the other end of the scale, hey, free tacos.

722
00:35:54,160 --> 00:35:58,160
Do they clarify somewhere on the press release how big the target is?

723
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:05,280
Yes, I'm going to move on to literally the second paragraph of this wild, wild press

724
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:05,920
release.

725
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:11,760
Later this week, all eyes will be fixed on the sky in anticipation of the 150 ton space

726
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:13,920
station's return to Earth.

727
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:18,080
Taco Bell has created a 40 by 40 foot target.

728
00:36:18,080 --> 00:36:20,000
Oh, that seems fucking fair.

729
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:24,800
The Pacific Ocean's only 63 million square miles, so that seems about fair.

730
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:33,360
It's a 40 by 40 foot target painted with a bell bull's eye and bold purple letters stating

731
00:36:33,360 --> 00:36:34,640
free taco here.

732
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:36,640
Thank God so the core can see it.

733
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:39,600
Yeah, so they can see it.

734
00:36:39,600 --> 00:36:40,640
Huh, what's that?

735
00:36:40,640 --> 00:36:41,680
I'm going to crash into that.

736
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:48,320
I've been in space for decades, but I still love humans enough to give them free tacos.

737
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:50,080
I care about this.

738
00:36:50,720 --> 00:36:55,280
The floating target will be placed in the South Pacific Ocean off the coast of Australia

739
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:56,720
in advance of Mir's descent.

740
00:36:57,440 --> 00:37:02,080
Taco Bell is capturing the imagination of millions of people as they eagerly await Mir's

741
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:06,960
return to Earth, said Chris Becker, a fucking optimist if I've ever seen one.

742
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:12,880
And also the vice president of brand communications, if Mir rings our bell, we'll offer a free

743
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:14,640
taco to everyone in the US.

744
00:37:14,640 --> 00:37:19,200
It should be noted that the NASA is asking us not to do this.

745
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:20,240
Don't do this.

746
00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:26,320
They have said, quote, if the core impacts anything, it could start a nuclear winter.

747
00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:28,720
But hey, we think it's worth it.

748
00:37:28,720 --> 00:37:34,320
They're also embarrassed that their bad spaceship broke and they don't want people to pay

749
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:35,360
attention to that.

750
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:40,400
Oh, my God.

751
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:44,880
If Mir rings our bell, we'll offer a free taco to everyone in the US.

752
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:49,440
First off, you know that it's a good statement if half of your quote is just repeating the

753
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:50,880
thing that we all understand.

754
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:53,120
Chris Becker then continues.

755
00:37:53,680 --> 00:38:01,600
If the core of Mir hits the designated Taco Bell target upon its reentry, every person

756
00:38:01,600 --> 00:38:09,280
in the United States will have an opportunity to obtain a coupon for a free taco valid at

757
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:11,280
participating Taco Bell restaurants.

758
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:17,680
By the way, if you're if you're Taco Bell franchise and you say I'm not doing that dumb

759
00:38:17,680 --> 00:38:22,400
space satellite promotion, you don't deserve the name Taco Bell.

760
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:24,480
You should be stripped of your badge.

761
00:38:25,600 --> 00:38:27,760
You don't get the spirit of the brand.

762
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:33,760
Coupon distribution, redemption and offer details will be made available to consumers

763
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:38,320
on the Taco Bell website and in press materials should this event occur.

764
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:40,240
So there's no fucking way.

765
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:44,560
I guarantee they did not even have a contingency for if this actually occurred.

766
00:38:44,560 --> 00:38:46,800
Yeah, these these websites were not drawn up.

767
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:50,160
Holy shit, though, if only they had been.

768
00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:56,240
I imagine they would be some Space Jam Geocities level internet events.

769
00:38:56,240 --> 00:39:02,480
The good news is that Taco Bell has purchased an insurance policy to cover the anticipated

770
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:07,600
cost of the free taco redemption should the core of Mir hit the target.

771
00:39:07,600 --> 00:39:08,640
You know, it's funny.

772
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:16,000
I now know because of the benefit of hindsight what the next 20 years had in store for all

773
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:24,320
of us, and I can think of many better insurance policies Taco Bell could have taken out then

774
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:29,440
insurance policy if the Mir space satellite hits our dumb ocean target.

775
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:36,080
So just to be clear, they went, man, 2001 was really a different time, huh?

776
00:39:36,080 --> 00:39:43,360
They walked into an office somewhere and said, we are voluntarily offering a promotion that

777
00:39:43,360 --> 00:39:50,240
could cost us millions of dollars and we need you to cover that in case that happens.

778
00:39:50,240 --> 00:39:52,080
And someone said, you've got it.

779
00:39:52,080 --> 00:39:54,240
And someone said, you've got it.

780
00:39:54,240 --> 00:39:55,280
Sounds great.

781
00:39:55,280 --> 00:39:58,240
The fucking fix was in from the start.

782
00:39:58,240 --> 00:40:02,880
I don't want to sound like a conspiracy theorist, but like I know that whoever was controlling

783
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:07,040
Mir got a little text from from, you know, Mr.

784
00:40:07,040 --> 00:40:13,840
Taco Bell and was like, hey, we need you to aim pretty far afield from this target because

785
00:40:13,840 --> 00:40:19,760
we will be fucking ruined if this if this smacks it, we will be in so much trouble and

786
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:22,320
there will be no more tacos and it'll be on your hands.

787
00:40:22,320 --> 00:40:28,160
I want you guys to know, I am now Googling, did Mir Space Station hit the Taco Bell target?

788
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:29,120
Justin Taleb, quick.

789
00:40:30,320 --> 00:40:32,480
I mean, I have no idea, but no.

790
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:33,680
But almost certainly not.

791
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:43,440
Okay, it did miss, but it says it missed by six inches.

792
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:44,080
Oh, man.

793
00:40:45,120 --> 00:40:47,280
No, it probably missed by a million bajillion miles.

794
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:47,920
Oh, yeah, definitely.

795
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:51,440
I mean, it didn't say how much it missed by, but I wanted to make it seem interesting.

796
00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:53,360
Oh, it was so close.

797
00:40:53,360 --> 00:40:55,280
It was so close, you guys.

798
00:40:55,280 --> 00:41:00,560
Like a bird, a seagull landed on it and scooted it just out of the way.

799
00:41:00,560 --> 00:41:05,200
A big piece was heading right for it and a big bird flew in the way and got exploded

800
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:07,440
and it made the shrapnel disappear.

801
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:07,920
Damn it.

802
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:10,240
But luckily, Solly got him back.

803
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:11,760
Solly fixed it for us.

804
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:15,600
Solly was so pissed that those birds took away our free tacos.

805
00:41:15,600 --> 00:41:17,200
He took those birds out.

806
00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:18,160
Good work, Solly.

807
00:41:18,160 --> 00:41:19,840
I need just a second.

808
00:41:19,840 --> 00:41:22,240
Can you guys give me just a second to run some quick math?

809
00:41:22,240 --> 00:41:22,880
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

810
00:41:23,600 --> 00:41:24,240
Yeah, good.

811
00:41:24,240 --> 00:41:24,720
Thank you.

812
00:41:24,720 --> 00:41:26,480
Just give me a second to run some math.

813
00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:30,720
I'll put some cool math sound effects on here.

814
00:41:30,720 --> 00:41:35,280
Yeah, if you would just let me run some math.

815
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:37,040
I'll just play a clip from Swordfish.

816
00:41:37,680 --> 00:41:38,640
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

817
00:41:38,640 --> 00:41:40,080
Maybe something like a ticker.

818
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:45,680
Like you're hitting keys, you know?

819
00:41:45,680 --> 00:41:47,760
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

820
00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:48,640
Just be quiet.

821
00:41:49,360 --> 00:41:50,560
Or you're doing it in your head.

822
00:41:51,840 --> 00:41:52,720
No, no, no.

823
00:41:52,720 --> 00:41:53,680
I mean, then I don't.

824
00:41:53,680 --> 00:41:54,720
Why do I need to be quiet?

825
00:41:56,080 --> 00:41:57,920
No, I mean, you don't need to be quiet.

826
00:41:57,920 --> 00:42:00,800
I'm just like, I'm trying to get a fix on something.

827
00:42:02,080 --> 00:42:04,400
Okay, so right.

828
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:09,280
Okay, so the, okay, now I understand.

829
00:42:09,280 --> 00:42:18,320
And so the target was placed in the South Pacific Ocean, right?

830
00:42:19,040 --> 00:42:20,800
And I'm looking at a follow up here.

831
00:42:21,840 --> 00:42:23,760
The QSR chain set up a floating target,

832
00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:25,040
carrying the company logo in the phrase,

833
00:42:25,040 --> 00:42:29,040
few targets here, about 10 miles off the coast of Australia.

834
00:42:31,440 --> 00:42:35,600
But Mir landed off course near Chile.

835
00:42:35,600 --> 00:42:36,320
That sucks.

836
00:42:36,880 --> 00:42:37,600
Oh, wow.

837
00:42:37,600 --> 00:42:38,880
That sucks.

838
00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:40,560
Fucking look at a map right now.

839
00:42:41,520 --> 00:42:42,880
It fucking sucks.

840
00:42:43,440 --> 00:42:43,940
Sucks.

841
00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:48,800
Either, okay, there's two possible scenarios.

842
00:42:49,760 --> 00:42:53,760
Either Taco Bell is an incredibly unscrupulous company,

843
00:42:53,760 --> 00:42:58,160
or we all came fucking super duper duper close

844
00:42:58,160 --> 00:42:59,840
to a very un-chilled day.

845
00:43:01,120 --> 00:43:02,880
That's like half the planet.

846
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:04,480
It's half the planet away.

847
00:43:04,480 --> 00:43:05,360
It's a hemisphere.

848
00:43:05,360 --> 00:43:07,280
It's like half a planet away.

849
00:43:07,280 --> 00:43:09,120
You fucked up so bad, Mir.

850
00:43:10,160 --> 00:43:10,960
Oh my God.

851
00:43:10,960 --> 00:43:11,520
Oh, wow.

852
00:43:12,960 --> 00:43:14,400
It's like way far away.

853
00:43:14,400 --> 00:43:15,760
It's pretty far away.

854
00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:17,600
I mean, okay, can I say this?

855
00:43:17,600 --> 00:43:19,360
Even in the grand scheme of things, Taco Bell,

856
00:43:19,920 --> 00:43:22,240
10 miles off the coast of Australia,

857
00:43:22,240 --> 00:43:25,040
you were kind of betting against Australia there, right?

858
00:43:25,040 --> 00:43:26,720
Like, yeah.

859
00:43:27,680 --> 00:43:30,800
It's not like you went dead center of the ocean or anything.

860
00:43:30,800 --> 00:43:31,120
No.

861
00:43:31,120 --> 00:43:32,800
You were like, I don't know,

862
00:43:32,800 --> 00:43:35,200
strong breeze and we lose Brisbane, you know?

863
00:43:35,200 --> 00:43:38,480
Yeah, the promotion says,

864
00:43:38,480 --> 00:43:40,960
we'll give a free taco to everybody in America.

865
00:43:40,960 --> 00:43:42,320
And sure, Australia too.

866
00:43:42,320 --> 00:43:43,040
Why not?

867
00:43:43,040 --> 00:43:44,560
That's not going to cost us anything.

868
00:43:46,320 --> 00:43:46,960
Fuck.

869
00:43:46,960 --> 00:43:48,160
It's 10 miles.

870
00:43:48,160 --> 00:43:48,640
It's so close.

871
00:43:48,640 --> 00:43:49,760
That's such a great point.

872
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:56,160
The real victory there would not be free tacos for America.

873
00:43:56,160 --> 00:43:59,440
It would be the continued existence of Australia.

874
00:43:59,440 --> 00:44:03,600
That's the equivalent of in a comet's going to hit the earth

875
00:44:03,600 --> 00:44:06,080
and like it just barely misses earth

876
00:44:06,080 --> 00:44:09,120
because at the last minute Bruce Willis set off the bomb.

877
00:44:09,120 --> 00:44:10,240
That's what we're looking at.

878
00:44:10,240 --> 00:44:11,680
That's that kind of scrape.

879
00:44:13,120 --> 00:44:14,400
Australia was probably like,

880
00:44:14,400 --> 00:44:17,120
oh, thank God you guys don't get tacos.

881
00:44:17,120 --> 00:44:18,960
I feel bad for the family in Chile

882
00:44:18,960 --> 00:44:22,320
whose little five-year-old son was like,

883
00:44:22,320 --> 00:44:24,720
Papa, I'm scared that the Mir space station

884
00:44:24,720 --> 00:44:25,840
is going to crash on us.

885
00:44:25,840 --> 00:44:27,280
And the dad has to say like,

886
00:44:27,280 --> 00:44:29,360
oh, don't worry, Taco Bell put the target

887
00:44:29,360 --> 00:44:30,640
a whole hemisphere away.

888
00:44:31,520 --> 00:44:33,200
We have nothing to worry about.

889
00:44:33,200 --> 00:44:36,640
The Taco Bell scientists have spent years.

890
00:44:36,640 --> 00:44:39,280
The Taco Bell mathematicians have done their work on this

891
00:44:39,280 --> 00:44:40,240
and they've done a great job.

892
00:44:40,240 --> 00:44:42,800
Son, you have nothing to worry about.

893
00:44:44,400 --> 00:44:45,040
No problem at all.

894
00:44:45,040 --> 00:44:46,640
No issues here.

895
00:44:47,200 --> 00:44:48,160
Hey, can I do a Yahoo?

896
00:44:48,880 --> 00:44:49,120
Sure.

897
00:44:49,120 --> 00:44:50,000
Yeah, I love that.

898
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:50,800
This one's a trip.

899
00:44:50,800 --> 00:44:53,120
It was sent in by Graham Robot.

900
00:44:53,120 --> 00:44:53,520
Thank you.

901
00:44:53,520 --> 00:44:56,960
It's a Yahoo answers user, Sean, who asks,

902
00:44:57,840 --> 00:45:00,080
how to get back at my jerk coworker.

903
00:45:00,640 --> 00:45:01,360
Yeah.

904
00:45:01,360 --> 00:45:06,240
Familiar premise, every time we are in Zoom meetings,

905
00:45:06,240 --> 00:45:07,520
so this is the during times,

906
00:45:08,320 --> 00:45:11,200
and I start waxing philosophical about our business,

907
00:45:11,760 --> 00:45:13,760
we sell tires, by the way,

908
00:45:13,760 --> 00:45:16,480
he refuses to engage and just says something sarcastic

909
00:45:16,480 --> 00:45:19,440
like, okay, Play-Doh, and everyone laughs,

910
00:45:19,440 --> 00:45:22,480
just laughs, their ugly yellow teeth

911
00:45:22,480 --> 00:45:25,120
showing like the rotten top of an old fence.

912
00:45:25,760 --> 00:45:26,400
Oh boy.

913
00:45:27,040 --> 00:45:29,840
I try to insist that what I was saying had some value

914
00:45:29,840 --> 00:45:32,000
and then my boss tries to placate me, right?

915
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:34,720
He says, oh, you know we love you, Sean,

916
00:45:34,720 --> 00:45:35,920
and he tries to move on,

917
00:45:36,480 --> 00:45:40,160
but I sit there and seethe every single time

918
00:45:40,160 --> 00:45:43,920
watching these robots rattle off facts and figures.

919
00:45:44,480 --> 00:45:46,560
I feel like I never have the perfect retort,

920
00:45:46,560 --> 00:45:48,880
no matter how much I try to write it out beforehand,

921
00:45:48,880 --> 00:45:50,960
it's never ready for primetime.

922
00:45:50,960 --> 00:45:53,440
Does anybody have a good one I can use?

923
00:45:53,440 --> 00:45:56,960
Drop your Venmo and I'll pay you for it.

924
00:45:56,960 --> 00:45:59,920
Wow, that's generous.

925
00:45:59,920 --> 00:46:02,000
I do like to picture this scene

926
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:04,000
of someone who's just dunked on Sean real hard

927
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:08,320
and you just hear, all right, what have I got here?

928
00:46:11,200 --> 00:46:12,400
Same on you, pal.

929
00:46:13,520 --> 00:46:15,040
Pretty good, $5 there.

930
00:46:17,200 --> 00:46:19,360
Sean sounds like a real cool dude to work with.

931
00:46:19,360 --> 00:46:21,840
Sean sounds like a real piece of work,

932
00:46:21,840 --> 00:46:24,480
but I mean, every tire store's got one.

933
00:46:24,480 --> 00:46:29,120
That old chestnut.

934
00:46:29,120 --> 00:46:31,760
And I get it, they sell tires,

935
00:46:31,760 --> 00:46:35,920
but that doesn't mean they have to just sell tires.

936
00:46:35,920 --> 00:46:36,960
No, if you think about it,

937
00:46:36,960 --> 00:46:38,640
the way that the wheel turns

938
00:46:39,520 --> 00:46:42,640
is kind of like the way that time is a flat circle.

939
00:46:42,640 --> 00:46:46,640
And when we sell a family a tire,

940
00:46:46,640 --> 00:46:49,680
what we're really doing is giving them security

941
00:46:49,680 --> 00:46:52,640
that their car won't just scrape along the road

942
00:46:52,640 --> 00:46:55,760
and make a terrible noise and sparks and stuff, you know?

943
00:46:55,760 --> 00:46:58,080
And the stinky car smell of that rubber.

944
00:46:58,080 --> 00:46:59,280
And the stinky car smell,

945
00:46:59,280 --> 00:47:01,040
and that's really what it's all about, you know?

946
00:47:01,040 --> 00:47:02,480
So it's like, okay, Plato.

947
00:47:02,480 --> 00:47:03,280
Fuck you.

948
00:47:08,880 --> 00:47:10,320
Okay, Plato's pretty choice.

949
00:47:12,160 --> 00:47:14,800
And I don't know, if I was ever working on a job

950
00:47:14,800 --> 00:47:16,720
and tried to stick up for myself and my boss said,

951
00:47:16,720 --> 00:47:18,400
oh, you know we love you, Griffin,

952
00:47:18,400 --> 00:47:23,040
I would probably have to leave that particular job.

953
00:47:23,040 --> 00:47:25,040
Because that falls under the category of things

954
00:47:25,040 --> 00:47:26,400
that someone says when you know

955
00:47:26,400 --> 00:47:28,640
that they mean the exact opposite of that thing.

956
00:47:29,360 --> 00:47:31,200
Because no one has ever had to say to someone,

957
00:47:31,200 --> 00:47:33,520
you know we love you, and had the other person go,

958
00:47:33,520 --> 00:47:35,360
yes, I do know that you do.

959
00:47:35,360 --> 00:47:36,640
It would drive me wild though,

960
00:47:36,640 --> 00:47:38,720
sitting in one of these meetings when somebody's like,

961
00:47:38,720 --> 00:47:41,280
these tires, we should sell them for $50.

962
00:47:42,560 --> 00:47:46,240
Oh, snooze, you know what I mean?

963
00:47:46,240 --> 00:47:49,120
Like, why though?

964
00:47:49,120 --> 00:47:51,600
Are we even still selling tires?

965
00:47:52,400 --> 00:47:55,360
Is it possible that Sean works with actual robots,

966
00:47:55,360 --> 00:47:57,680
like the robots that take tires off of cars

967
00:47:57,680 --> 00:47:58,720
and put new ones on?

968
00:47:58,720 --> 00:48:00,880
I see him in the Ford commercials sometimes,

969
00:48:00,880 --> 00:48:02,160
making sparks and everything.

970
00:48:02,160 --> 00:48:04,080
What if Sean works with those and he makes a joke

971
00:48:04,080 --> 00:48:05,520
and they're like, okay, Plato.

972
00:48:06,320 --> 00:48:07,360
He's like, goddammit.

973
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:11,040
They literally cannot understand the concept

974
00:48:11,040 --> 00:48:14,880
of the platonic ideal of a wheel.

975
00:48:14,880 --> 00:48:16,640
Yeah, he has been trying to like,

976
00:48:16,640 --> 00:48:20,640
not just, they understand the mechanics of tires.

977
00:48:20,640 --> 00:48:23,440
He's trying to elevate them to a new level

978
00:48:23,440 --> 00:48:25,680
of understanding the spirituality of it.

979
00:48:25,680 --> 00:48:26,960
But they're robots, you know,

980
00:48:26,960 --> 00:48:28,400
they have a hard time dealing

981
00:48:28,400 --> 00:48:31,120
with those kind of ethereal concepts.

982
00:48:31,120 --> 00:48:33,680
And so because they're embarrassed by their inability

983
00:48:33,680 --> 00:48:37,040
to grasp these concepts, they have to put him down.

984
00:48:37,040 --> 00:48:38,400
Right, like they're robots,

985
00:48:38,400 --> 00:48:40,800
they know about the allegory of the cave,

986
00:48:40,800 --> 00:48:42,880
but they can't possibly conceive

987
00:48:42,880 --> 00:48:45,200
of how it relates to selling

988
00:48:45,200 --> 00:48:47,680
these incredible Firestone tires.

989
00:48:47,680 --> 00:48:48,640
Exactly.

990
00:48:48,640 --> 00:48:50,400
It would be hard to get a leg up on them

991
00:48:50,400 --> 00:48:52,400
because they would just search the cloud.

992
00:48:52,400 --> 00:48:54,160
I'm searching the cloud for the best way

993
00:48:54,160 --> 00:48:55,360
to tear you down.

994
00:48:55,360 --> 00:48:56,960
One second, processing.

995
00:48:58,320 --> 00:49:00,080
Here is a picture of your ex-girlfriend.

996
00:49:00,080 --> 00:49:02,720
Oh, you got me.

997
00:49:02,720 --> 00:49:04,240
That was very painful.

998
00:49:04,240 --> 00:49:05,280
But also very good.

999
00:49:05,280 --> 00:49:10,320
I had to Venmo a stranger.

1000
00:49:13,520 --> 00:49:17,040
You send the Venmo for a great bird

1001
00:49:17,040 --> 00:49:19,280
and then one of the robots dings.

1002
00:49:19,280 --> 00:49:21,280
That was me, I created that.

1003
00:49:22,240 --> 00:49:24,480
You just bought one of my insults.

1004
00:49:24,480 --> 00:49:25,840
This question's hot off the presses.

1005
00:49:25,840 --> 00:49:27,200
This is from two days ago.

1006
00:49:27,200 --> 00:49:29,040
And a commenter responded,

1007
00:49:29,040 --> 00:49:32,000
ignore him and sell more tires than he does.

1008
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:32,640
Fucking great.

1009
00:49:32,640 --> 00:49:35,360
You would think that's ironclad,

1010
00:49:35,360 --> 00:49:37,280
but Sean responded pretty much right away.

1011
00:49:37,280 --> 00:49:38,240
Yeah, I thought about that,

1012
00:49:38,240 --> 00:49:39,840
but then he'll say something like,

1013
00:49:39,840 --> 00:49:41,120
nice sales, Loman.

1014
00:49:41,120 --> 00:49:43,440
So now we do know this gentleman's entire name.

1015
00:49:44,960 --> 00:49:45,760
No, hold on.

1016
00:49:45,760 --> 00:49:48,480
No-man is about, that's lovely Loman.

1017
00:49:48,480 --> 00:49:49,040
It's worse.

1018
00:49:50,240 --> 00:49:53,280
This person just made a hilarious death of a salesman.

1019
00:49:53,280 --> 00:49:54,800
About themself too.

1020
00:49:54,800 --> 00:49:57,360
Hey, Sean sounds like a real treat to work with.

1021
00:49:58,400 --> 00:49:59,200
He'll say something like,

1022
00:49:59,200 --> 00:50:00,240
nice sales, Loman,

1023
00:50:00,240 --> 00:50:02,160
and then he'll have the place in Stitches.

1024
00:50:02,160 --> 00:50:03,840
That bastard always wins.

1025
00:50:04,400 --> 00:50:05,600
If you fucking,

1026
00:50:05,600 --> 00:50:08,240
if you can drop an Arthur Miller reference

1027
00:50:08,240 --> 00:50:10,560
and make him bus up your whole office,

1028
00:50:10,560 --> 00:50:13,360
that's a cool place to work in Sean's The Problem.

1029
00:50:13,360 --> 00:50:15,200
Oh, hold on.

1030
00:50:15,200 --> 00:50:16,560
There's no doubt in anyone's mind

1031
00:50:16,560 --> 00:50:17,920
Sean's The Problem here, yes?

1032
00:50:19,200 --> 00:50:20,400
No, we can all agree.

1033
00:50:20,400 --> 00:50:20,720
Okay.

1034
00:50:20,720 --> 00:50:22,800
We all feel pretty confident that Sean's The Problem.

1035
00:50:24,720 --> 00:50:26,240
Good sales, Loman.

1036
00:50:27,040 --> 00:50:28,400
Good sales.

1037
00:50:28,400 --> 00:50:29,840
Way to do your job, idiot.

1038
00:50:29,840 --> 00:50:33,280
What a weird, ironic insult of like,

1039
00:50:33,280 --> 00:50:35,200
but I did sell a lot of tires.

1040
00:50:35,200 --> 00:50:37,520
I was successful at my job.

1041
00:50:37,520 --> 00:50:38,640
I'm employee of the month.

1042
00:50:38,640 --> 00:50:40,400
Yeah, good work, Loman.

1043
00:50:40,400 --> 00:50:40,880
No, but-

1044
00:50:40,880 --> 00:50:41,600
Yeah, nice.

1045
00:50:41,600 --> 00:50:42,800
No, but he's,

1046
00:50:42,800 --> 00:50:44,800
the whole thing is his experience is that

1047
00:50:44,800 --> 00:50:47,440
he no longer sees himself as useful in the world

1048
00:50:47,440 --> 00:50:50,720
and he is no longer an effective salesman.

1049
00:50:50,720 --> 00:50:51,520
Yeah, whatever.

1050
00:50:51,520 --> 00:50:52,240
Yeah, whatever.

1051
00:50:52,240 --> 00:50:52,960
Arthur Miller.

1052
00:50:53,520 --> 00:50:54,880
No, but Arthur Miller did right.

1053
00:50:57,200 --> 00:50:58,160
Now they would,

1054
00:50:58,160 --> 00:51:00,480
they would ditch this zero,

1055
00:51:01,760 --> 00:51:06,240
but he does lay the huge eggs that the tires come out of.

1056
00:51:06,240 --> 00:51:06,880
Yep.

1057
00:51:06,880 --> 00:51:11,040
And it's just the clearance that they get on those

1058
00:51:11,040 --> 00:51:12,960
is just out of this world.

1059
00:51:12,960 --> 00:51:13,440
Yep.

1060
00:51:13,440 --> 00:51:16,000
Out of his huge ass.

1061
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:16,640
Oh, sorry.

1062
00:51:16,640 --> 00:51:17,200
Yeah, go ahead.

1063
00:51:17,760 --> 00:51:19,520
No, Griffin, tell me more about the eggs

1064
00:51:19,520 --> 00:51:20,960
that come out of this human man.

1065
00:51:20,960 --> 00:51:23,280
He's got a big butt and the eggs come out of them

1066
00:51:23,280 --> 00:51:24,640
and then when they hatch,

1067
00:51:24,640 --> 00:51:26,480
that's where they get the tires that they sell.

1068
00:51:26,480 --> 00:51:27,520
So it's just pure profit.

1069
00:51:27,520 --> 00:51:28,720
It's pure profit.

1070
00:51:28,720 --> 00:51:29,760
Oh, I see, okay.

1071
00:51:29,760 --> 00:51:31,520
No one else lays the tire eggs.

1072
00:51:31,520 --> 00:51:31,760
No, that's true.

1073
00:51:31,760 --> 00:51:34,000
So they have to keep Sean around.

1074
00:51:34,880 --> 00:51:37,680
Another thing about Max Fun Drive this year

1075
00:51:37,680 --> 00:51:39,360
that I want to tell you all about,

1076
00:51:39,360 --> 00:51:41,360
if you are already a member

1077
00:51:41,360 --> 00:51:43,920
and you have maybe a friend or a loved one

1078
00:51:43,920 --> 00:51:45,360
or a family member or something

1079
00:51:45,360 --> 00:51:47,520
who would love all that bonus content,

1080
00:51:47,520 --> 00:51:48,560
love all those gifts,

1081
00:51:48,560 --> 00:51:50,640
but they are not able to become a member,

1082
00:51:50,640 --> 00:51:53,920
this year you can also gift donations to them.

1083
00:51:53,920 --> 00:51:56,960
We're just so grateful to everybody who has supported us

1084
00:51:56,960 --> 00:51:59,920
and everybody who not just gives financially,

1085
00:51:59,920 --> 00:52:01,280
but listens to the shows,

1086
00:52:02,160 --> 00:52:04,960
tells their friends about it, everything.

1087
00:52:04,960 --> 00:52:06,400
Like seeing people tweet

1088
00:52:06,400 --> 00:52:08,160
about how much episodes mean to them

1089
00:52:08,160 --> 00:52:10,000
or that something cracked them up.

1090
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:13,600
Like knowing that we are able to make people smile

1091
00:52:13,600 --> 00:52:16,480
from time to time during really, really scary times,

1092
00:52:16,480 --> 00:52:17,680
that means a lot to us.

1093
00:52:17,680 --> 00:52:20,320
And knowing that it matters enough that,

1094
00:52:20,320 --> 00:52:21,920
you know, if you can,

1095
00:52:21,920 --> 00:52:24,160
you make the decision to support our shows

1096
00:52:24,160 --> 00:52:25,120
means a lot to us.

1097
00:52:25,120 --> 00:52:27,040
So thank you to everybody

1098
00:52:27,040 --> 00:52:28,400
and thank you just for listening.

1099
00:52:28,400 --> 00:52:30,160
So if you are not a member

1100
00:52:30,160 --> 00:52:32,560
or if you want to boost your membership

1101
00:52:32,560 --> 00:52:35,920
or if you want to give a membership to somebody else,

1102
00:52:35,920 --> 00:52:39,760
you can go to maximumfun.org slash join

1103
00:52:39,760 --> 00:52:41,680
and check out all the information there.

1104
00:52:41,680 --> 00:52:43,040
When someone boosts their donation,

1105
00:52:43,040 --> 00:52:44,800
can we call it hitting the nos?

1106
00:52:44,800 --> 00:52:46,400
I think that's probably okay.

1107
00:52:47,280 --> 00:52:48,000
Punch the nos.

1108
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:48,640
Yeah.

1109
00:52:48,640 --> 00:52:51,680
And punch the nos on your MP3 player

1110
00:52:51,680 --> 00:52:53,760
as you listen to It's a Departure

1111
00:52:53,760 --> 00:52:55,760
off the album Putting the Days to Bed by the Long Winters,

1112
00:52:55,760 --> 00:52:58,320
who have graciously allowed us to use the song Thank You.

1113
00:52:58,320 --> 00:53:00,560
And not gonna make Max Fun again,

1114
00:53:00,560 --> 00:53:03,360
they've gotten their fill.

1115
00:53:03,360 --> 00:53:04,400
Their pound of flesh.

1116
00:53:06,240 --> 00:53:09,760
And we have a new graphic novel out this week.

1117
00:53:09,760 --> 00:53:10,480
Is it this week?

1118
00:53:10,480 --> 00:53:10,980
Yeah.

1119
00:53:11,440 --> 00:53:12,800
Fuck.

1120
00:53:12,800 --> 00:53:14,560
Anyway, go to theadventurezonecomic.com,

1121
00:53:14,560 --> 00:53:15,200
it's real good.

1122
00:53:15,760 --> 00:53:16,640
Oh, speaking of,

1123
00:53:16,640 --> 00:53:19,200
we're doing a book event for the Adventure Zone comic

1124
00:53:19,200 --> 00:53:19,920
on the 17th.

1125
00:53:20,560 --> 00:53:22,480
It's gonna be on our YouTube channel.

1126
00:53:22,480 --> 00:53:24,160
We'll tweet all the updates and stuff

1127
00:53:24,160 --> 00:53:26,720
on the McRoy family Twitter account,

1128
00:53:27,360 --> 00:53:28,720
but it's gonna be really fun.

1129
00:53:28,720 --> 00:53:29,840
It's gonna be great.

1130
00:53:31,440 --> 00:53:32,480
So y'all want the final?

1131
00:53:33,840 --> 00:53:34,960
Final Yahoo.

1132
00:53:34,960 --> 00:53:36,560
This one was sent in by Hattrick.

1133
00:53:36,560 --> 00:53:38,480
Graham Roebuck crushed it.

1134
00:53:38,480 --> 00:53:39,200
Thank you, Graham.

1135
00:53:39,200 --> 00:53:41,760
It's Yahoo Answers user Josh, who asks,

1136
00:53:43,600 --> 00:53:46,160
how do I get pickle smell off body quick?

1137
00:53:50,400 --> 00:53:51,680
I'm gonna read the next.

1138
00:53:51,680 --> 00:53:53,840
My mom can't know I've been eating her pickles.

1139
00:53:53,840 --> 00:53:54,800
She gets off work soon,

1140
00:53:54,800 --> 00:53:56,560
and she's gonna smell them unless I get it off.

1141
00:53:56,560 --> 00:53:58,240
Tried shower, still stinks.

1142
00:54:00,800 --> 00:54:02,000
Update, update.

1143
00:54:03,040 --> 00:54:03,600
She knows.

1144
00:54:06,400 --> 00:54:07,760
My name is Justin McRoy.

1145
00:54:12,480 --> 00:54:14,160
I'm Griffin McRoy.

1146
00:54:14,160 --> 00:54:15,520
This has been my brother, my brother and me.

1147
00:54:15,520 --> 00:54:25,120
