1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:30,800
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:48,240
Hello everybody, welcome, my brother, my brother, me, and advice show and cereal roundup,

6
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:51,840
Wrap Gap for the modern era. I'm your little brother Justin McElroy.

7
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:54,080
I'm your middle-aged brother Travis McElroy.

8
00:00:54,080 --> 00:00:58,400
I'm your babiest baby brother Griffin McElroy. Let's get to the wrap gap.

9
00:00:58,400 --> 00:01:02,400
Yep, it's that. No, it's a wrap cap. It's like a wrap up and a recap.

10
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:05,520
Okay, this is your official cereal after show.

11
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:14,160
So where we look at the latest episode of true crime special cereal and we discuss where the

12
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:18,960
clues are leading us. I have to say I think it's pretty obvious at this point.

13
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:23,760
What do you think Travis? What are your suspicions based on the recent revelations

14
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:29,840
that the the Best Buy was a front this whole time? Well, I'm gonna say two words Justin,

15
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:37,680
fugue state. Fugue state. I think the reporter entered into a few state and did it and now

16
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:43,120
like 15 years later is like reporting on the crime. Huge twist Shyamalan.

17
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:48,480
I will say that is a fucking awesome cover-up is like I'm gonna get to the bottom of this,

18
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:52,320
but I'm having trouble getting to the bottom of it. Are you having trouble getting to the

19
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:57,280
bottom of it or are you the bottom? Well, she doesn't know because it was a fugue state. That's

20
00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:01,760
the twist. It's like she's gonna like find out and be like oh my god it's all pointing to me.

21
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:07,120
If she wasn't forgetting what happened every day whenever she fell asleep, it would be so much

22
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:10,800
easier for her to catch the criminal. Series finale is just gonna be her like

23
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:18,400
all of this discussion of trying to remember where these teens were makes me try, makes me

24
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:22,720
want to try and think where I was. Let me think oh my god I can't believe oh my god I'm covered

25
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:28,960
in blood still. Probably the craziest thing about Serial to Me, a podcast that I listen to,

26
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:35,920
is where is this lady finding all these teens? Yeah. She seems to know where a lot of teens hang

27
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:40,320
out and I swear to god I haven't seen a teenager in three years. And if you did, how the fuck would

28
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:43,920
you approach them without scaring them away like some sort of- I want to talk to you about a Best

29
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:50,000
Buy parking lot. No! I don't get teens to talk to you. The craziest thing about this show,

30
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:54,960
as long as we're talking about Serial, is that the events in it happened 15 years ago.

31
00:02:55,680 --> 00:03:00,880
And there are people on this show that talk about what happened at a certain time. I have four

32
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:08,960
pictures in my entire mind's eye from my entire freshman year of high school 15 years ago. And

33
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:14,880
one of them is me sitting in sweatpants listening to DC Talk on a portable CD player in the band

34
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:19,600
instrument closet. And in your head it's just subtitled Coolest Day Ever. Justin where were

35
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:25,440
you? Where were you on February 20th 1995? I can tell you exactly where I was motherfucker. Check

36
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:31,520
the DC Talk. Check my DC Talk? Let me get- let me open up my dismount and you check the memory.

37
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:37,040
But then you see I was listening to Jesus Freak on that exact day. Then he opened up the Walkman

38
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:47,360
and there was no DC Talk. It was Newsboys. Murder solved. Fugue State. I think that I

39
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:53,120
have only listened to half of an episode but I'm starting to think that maybe this is fiction.

40
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:57,440
This is a work of fiction. And I know that you can google it and like find the news reports

41
00:03:58,320 --> 00:04:02,080
saying that this this girl was actually murdered. It's an ARG. They play with those. But maybe it's

42
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:10,560
a fucking ARG and maybe I think that somebody is using this to sell us all Pringles. I think it's

43
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:15,840
a Pringles ARG. That does explain why they keep talking about Pringles at the scene of the crime.

44
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:20,400
Exactly. Jay is like I- he called me up and he was like I'm gonna murder her today.

45
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:26,240
Sir I'm gonna have to- I gotta ask you to stop eating those Pringles while we're taking your

46
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:31,920
testimony. I'm sorry now that I popped I just can't stop. I just cannot stop. The most frustrating

47
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:37,600
like experience of serial listening must be for the guy who used to run Circuit City. Because

48
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:43,760
every episode is an extended commercial for Best Buy. Like they don't need the exposure. I bet that

49
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:48,560
guy is wishing on every star he can find that someone would get murdered in the parking lot

50
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:54,400
of a Circuit City 15 years ago because he needs that heat. Yeah. Yeah. Do you know what I think

51
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:59,360
the most confusing thing about serial is? What's that, Travis? I've listened to nine episodes and

52
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:05,120
they have yet to mention Cinnamon Toast Crunch. Okay come on. Low hanging fruit is the sweetest

53
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:11,280
of fruits. I think we're like we're more than 200 episodes into this thing I think that we can hold

54
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:16,000
ourselves to a higher standard than that. Okay but I will say- French Toast Crunch. In Travis's

55
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:21,360
defense I have had at least three experiences in the past couple weeks since Sydney and I started

56
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:26,240
listening to serial where she will say to me I read the craziest thing about serial today and

57
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:32,480
I'll perk up like oh that is a that is a favorite topic oh mine did they bring back they brought

58
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:39,040
back oops all berries it's called ah fuck all berries I might have killed the girl all berries

59
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:46,640
ah shit all berries odd dunk where were you when all these berries happened what if it what if it

60
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:52,480
ties back to that Jay is like yeah I totally remember he was eating a bowl of oops all berries

61
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:58,560
nope sorry oops all berries is out of circulation then check the calendar it is it was not being

62
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:04,240
made then oh I'm sorry he was eating a McRib no he wasn't no it was not he was not eating a McRib

63
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:10,320
he was listening to DC talk was he or was it Switchfoot ah shit all berries let's do a question

64
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:16,240
yeah that sounds good by the way sorry can I apologize to everybody that this is what I sound

65
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:24,480
like it you can hear you can hear my slimy vocal cords just slapping together forming each consonant

66
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:29,680
and vowel and I apologize like a drunk seal we had to alter Griffin's voice because he doesn't

67
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:36,080
want to be identified I don't want to be identified I'm actually the guy from the serial show I need

68
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:40,640
to listen to more of it my wife won a car a while back and firmly believed it had something to do

69
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:45,760
with a lucky crystal she bought I'm quit ever since then there has been an increasing number

70
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:57,920
of crystals appearing around the house am I good god damn you ah fuck you can't make me laugh like

71
00:06:57,920 --> 00:07:02,400
that when I got the the consumption you actually sound better I feel like the crystals healed you

72
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:10,720
oh fuck thank you oh it was the topaz mmm it was the lustrous topaz on an episode of uh

73
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:15,840
Penn and Teller's bullshit they say this phrase like everybody's got a gree-gree or something

74
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:20,160
along those lines so like everybody's got a thing that like they cling to it's like they're special

75
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:25,120
like and I feel like this is a case of that I think if everybody were to look deep within

76
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:29,440
themselves everybody has a thing where they were like oh yeah when this really good thing happened

77
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:33,600
I was wearing this t-shirt so like this is my lucky t-shirt and they always kind of say it like

78
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:38,000
jokingly like I'm using a tone of voice that shows that I don't really think this is serious

79
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:43,680
but I said it 20 times today it's so serious but here's the thing can I tell you two something

80
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:52,240
I've never fucked with crystals and I've never won a car yep Justin gave me his Oldsmobile Cutlass

81
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:59,600
Sierra um when he upgraded and I guess that was free and you are and to be fair you were on

82
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:06,960
crystal meth at the time okay I was on that lucky crystal meth I was on that sweet crunch um that

83
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:12,800
oops all berries and I did get a free car so I take it back crystals are legit they resonate

84
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:19,680
at a frequency that human beings can't understand but the Silurians can I think that if someone says

85
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:24,560
they have a lucky crystal you should tell them they have to eat it because think about it if

86
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:31,520
it's so lucky that should go fine if it's so lucky you should want it inside of you powering your

87
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:38,800
body yeah like uh like that that like krang in that weird exoskeleton you should want this stone

88
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:45,600
this crystal inside of you if it's so lucky so eat it already you should start fighting crime

89
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:50,640
or something it's like I have a crystal that protects me from all harm like cool you need

90
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:55,760
to leave here or we're going to shoot you to death yeah go ahead and try check out my amethyst

91
00:08:55,760 --> 00:09:02,480
motherfucker I want a car with this shit I want a car with this and it also makes me unkillable

92
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:06,720
I might be leaving the conclusions I might be leaving the conclusions here but just try and

93
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:13,440
shoot me through the topaz you cannot sir this story is distinctly American it we find one

94
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:19,120
crystal that has the magic power to give us cars and we what do we do are we thrilled that we found

95
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:25,040
them no no we start trying to scam crystals from every which way we can exactly you did you exhaust

96
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:30,160
the charge on that like why don't you just roll with the one lucky crystal that you found it sounds

97
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:34,400
like the reporter from serial could use a magic topaz and somebody would hand it to her and she'd

98
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:38,960
be like oh it was Jay oh god of course the whole time it was right in front of me it was Jay the

99
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:44,800
whole time I am so sorry I just wasted everybody's time for for for a dozen hours trying to figure

100
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:48,720
this thing out I could have just touched this topaz and the answer would have revealed itself

101
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:53,360
to me do you think maybe it's like a ring of keys where this is her lucky car crystal and then she's

102
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:58,720
got like a lucky job crystal and she's got like a lucky like the food order I made came back

103
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:03,200
perfect crystal do you think she has a crystal that helps her find sweet crystals oh this is

104
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:11,200
my crystal crystal crystal yeah this is my crystal gale crystal that I'll crystal gale vinyl I think

105
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:16,880
that if this is her thing if this is like your wife's thing there there is a saturation point

106
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:21,520
where I think you get to say like honey the crystals they're everywhere we don't have money

107
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:26,400
for food because you bought crystals but I think I think that that line is the first time you step

108
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:32,080
on one yeah like the first time well not so lucky it seems it seems this one might be busted

109
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:36,880
check the energy on it somebody call a ghostbuster the energons in this one aren't quite matching up

110
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:44,320
maybe we go a different way do you want to yahoo yeah hit me this yahoo was sent in by sarah benson

111
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:50,720
thank you sarah you send in a lot of great yahoo's this week sarah so the I feel like we should have

112
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:54,880
a new segment on the show called game recognized game where people just like crush it with yahoo's

113
00:10:55,600 --> 00:11:01,440
um game recognized game sarah benson great job it's asked by yahoo answers user whoa fuck

114
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:09,760
before I and then there's a check mark and then you are you and then it's slash and then 18

115
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:18,000
that probably means some sort of sex thing before I check you this random string of gobbledygook

116
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:29,520
asks before I check you are you slash before I check you are you 18 that's what it is all right

117
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:36,720
gross cool history you must have a back cool backstory that you have contained in a single

118
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:44,960
username this horrible goblin asks in the truman show do they film him when he's in the shower

119
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:51,680
in the toilet or making love topical because they film every second of his life but those

120
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:55,600
things are pretty big parts of everyone's life it is certainly a big part of mine

121
00:11:56,400 --> 00:12:03,360
and I don't think they'd show the whole world that it's a pretty big plot hole okay I don't

122
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:09,120
good morning good evening and in case I don't see you again good night be right back

123
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:14,560
and then he has diarrhea for 45 minutes I'm gonna I'm gonna say that this is the most frustrating

124
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:20,320
yahoo answers question we've ever had and I'll tell you why in the movie the truman show when

125
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:25,760
he is about to make love they deal with that and the camera pans to the curtains it's a whole

126
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:34,000
fucking scene and they deal with it okay but but but but but but but but but but but maybe a sweet

127
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:39,280
sweet oh and maybe he wants to show full penetration maybe the camera operator is asleep

128
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:46,480
at the wheel and they show full jim carrey penetration wouldn't be a great scene in truman

129
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:51,440
show if they pulled back and the whole time there was just a camera operator standing pretend like

130
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:56,160
i'm not here what a way to boost it is an artificial way to boost ratings of hey guys

131

136
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:34,160
poisoning him that's what i think i tell you uh i i i don't know if this policy extends to

137
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:39,280
self-pleasuring but if i had been the star of the truman show the years between middle of middle

138
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:43,840

00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:14,960
of your sin you did that how much of it there is do you think that if truman had just turned out

144
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:19,600
to be like a really boring dude and like the show had gotten cancelled they would have murdered him

145
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:24,960
we should ask the stars of utopia who are currently living through this exact thing oh

146
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:30,720
god guys on utopia first of all i'm sorry that i cancelled your television show by talking about

147
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:37,600
it on our podcast um this podcast is basically the indian in the cupboard of reality shows by

148
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:43,280
which i mean if i say something happens then it becomes real and it becomes extant i i have to

149
00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:48,160
be fucking careful with this power with this crystal power that i've developed and not like

150
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:53,600
say any shit about survivor or amazing race because i how could i live without those truman

151
00:14:53,600 --> 00:15:00,320
other what other activities would the camera not be able to show if true like what would

152
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:05,680
you not put in the show what if he was super racist super racist and it was just like hey

153
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:10,000
can we get like some good influences in there we've tried like the teachers system the parents

154
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:14,240
who said i don't know where he gets it from i don't know super racist his whole life has been

155
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:19,920
artificial we've controlled every single element in his life i do not know it has somebody been

156
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:26,720
sneaking him blue collar comedy has somebody been smuggling blue collar comedy into the biodome

157
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:32,320
we never yeah we don't really deal with like truman's super excited when he gets out if i

158
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:37,280
found out that people had filmed everything i had done until i turned like 30 god

159
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:41,840
woof that is going to be a hard nap for me i'm gonna have to lay down for a little while and

160
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:46,320
just sort of process that would have been way better in any of that movie if he was like so all

161
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:55,520
the jerk offs yep every single one because i did 3482 and the audience loved each and every one

162
00:15:55,520 --> 00:16:01,040
and also truman we need to let you know there's a thing called the internet and people have been

163
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:06,160
tracking these obsessively there are several tumblers devoted to your jerk off schedule

164
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:12,800
how about another question i do my laundry at the laundromat sometimes when i go to bump my

165
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:17,200
clothes from the wash to the dryer all the dryers all clothes in them some of the jars won't even

166
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:20,880
be in the process of drying the clothes clothes will just be hanging out in the dryer taking up

167
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:25,040
space what's the appropriate amount of time to wait for the owner of the clothes to arrive and

168
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:28,800
remove their dry clothes before you just get up fed up and take the clothes out and put them on

169
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:35,040
the counter somewhere so you can use the dryer that's from ornery in oregon when i think about

170
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:41,200
this i think this just says a lot about me in that i just if i encounter this problem i think

171
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:46,720
man i'm losing at laundry today i'll wait like i just feel like the other people got there first

172
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:52,000
they did it better and i am i am losing it well they didn't do it better if they just leave their

173
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:57,280
fucking garbage in the dryer for six days is that not a worry for other people i mean movies have

174
00:16:57,280 --> 00:17:02,240
made me afraid that people are going to steal my clothes out of out of the dryers can you imagine

175
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:10,080
it take it took me a long long time to develop my look you guys know this sure yeah me of course

176
00:17:10,080 --> 00:17:20,160
um my look it took me a really long time to discover that my um weird body shape can only

177
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:26,880
really truly be accommodated by v-neck t-shirts from old navy so maybe not like a lot of work

178
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:32,800
maybe a lot of initial like investigation but then i just know to buy um chunky midsection

179
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:39,280
t-shirts at old navy yeah um and i spent a lot of those like high collared t-shirts yeah and it

180
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:43,920
looked bizarre it looked bizarre it was like a melting marshmallow on a rotten stump it was

181
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:50,720
bizarre that was my whole body was just all very stumpy and rotten just bad all over just sour and

182
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:54,960
then you put on the old navy v-neck it was like oh that's like a neutral okay that's like a neutral

183
00:17:55,520 --> 00:18:02,400
where where did griffin go um and i've spent a lot of money on these three dollar t-shirts um

184
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:09,200
can you imagine just being like i'm gonna leave my entire look and i'm gonna go down the street

185
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:14,640
to chipotle for four hours and just like good luck clothes just stay right there don't get stole

186
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:20,960
it's it is it is that's like my baby you know what i mean that my look is everything to me

187
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:25,280
and you're just you're just potentially sacrificing that it would take so long

188
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:30,480
to rebuild that look from the ground it would take you could 25 minutes to remember the colors

189
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:35,760
of shitty v-neck t-shirts that i got from old navy that lasts for about four weeks i just like

i can only imagine that's going to be compounded in the intervening decades yeah don't even be

213
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:22,240
young around me you want you want your your grandchildren to wear old person makeup when

214
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:28,080
they walk in the room like spike jones style yeah i think one of my favorite memories of pa pa is

215
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:33,280
like him sitting there and just whoever else was talking in the room talking at a level that only

216
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:38,160
you sitting next to him could hear and he would just be like making fun of them or saying shit

217
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:42,240
about him like yeah just keeps on talking and nobody's really listening and i don't know why

218
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:45,600
she keeps talking like that like i'd like to talk but nobody else is gonna let me because

219
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:49,520
she's in there talking to a lot and it was the best thing it was a very subtle burn he had very

220
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:54,880
subtly spit on your ferret he used to like i remember one time with pa pa we rolled up to

221
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:58,960
like a taco bell and he just kept saying like i want an apple pie ask them if they have apple pie

222
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:05,200
and then looking at me and winking like you dick and then mom would try to explain like no no dad

223
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:12,400
they don't this is talking about it but i want an apple pie wink you dick that's bit commitment

224
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:16,480
that's the one thing that old people have in spades i think it's just the ability to say i

225
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:20,000
don't know if this bit's funny or not but i'm gonna lean into it because how many more bits

278
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:53,120
hanging off the back of the device is a rod with a ball on the end of it and i guess that's for

your butt so it is an all-in-one device sort of like the magic bullet for your dick and your balls

317
00:32:00,800 --> 00:32:06,160
time i turn on hulu i find something on there that either i've forgotten it existed or i just

318
00:32:06,160 --> 00:32:11,040
assumed wouldn't be out to watch yet because it was too new and it's there yesterday i found

319
00:32:11,040 --> 00:32:16,800
garth moran's dark place which is it's hilarious it's like a six episode spoof on like 70s and

320
00:32:16,800 --> 00:32:21,920
80s like horror shows it is the funniest thing i've ever watched and i haven't watched it since

321
00:32:21,920 --> 00:32:27,040
it was on tv and there it is on hulu every episode of the season and like that's all i

322
00:32:27,040 --> 00:32:31,200
did for the rest of the day i was like well this is what i'm doing so i guarantee you it's it's

323
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:36,960
like 7.99 a month and the greatest value for that money because you're going to find something new

324
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:42,400
on there every time you look um i guess we could do an antm check in although it seems like they're

325
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:47,200
fucking calming it down a little bit like they've actually been modeling and not like doing dna

326
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:56,880
tests and dressing up like uh native american robots um although they did make them act and

327
00:32:56,880 --> 00:33:01,920
that should just be banned from the show from this point on no more acting did aaron sorkin

328
00:33:01,920 --> 00:33:06,880

373
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:18,080
fan fiction with two characters loosely based on well hold on okay she has told me that these two

374
00:38:18,080 --> 00:38:23,760
characters eventually end up dating i'm a little worried will her writing reveal uncomfortable

375
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:28,000
truths about how she sees me or wishes that i was should i stop reading now or am i worried

376
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:33,040
about nothing that's from confundus charmed in california folks these are the kinds of

377
00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:38,480
questions we need this is a perfect my brother my brother me question thank you and then when

378
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:44,000
steve the wizard pulled out his wand jenna said sure it's a little small but that's okay i still

379
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:49,600
love you it's filled honey i want to talk about this paragraph no it's a wand i talked about how

380
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:54,480
it's phoenix feather and dragon heart string and boy i wish it was thicker just a little bit

381
00:38:54,480 --> 00:39:02,080
um and steve the wizard always chewed with his mouth open and sarah the wizard hated that hey

382
00:39:02,080 --> 00:39:07,280
sarah hey sarah let's talk about this one day sarah the wizard got enchanted dagger and buried

383
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:12,480
it in his fucking throat because he couldn't keep his goddamn mouth shut and i'm also i'm talking

384
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:16,720
to you i mean first of all let's talk about the terminology because it doesn't sound like harry

385
00:39:16,720 --> 00:39:21,520
potter fan fiction it sounds like maybe a little bit of extended universe a little bit of eu a

386
00:39:21,520 --> 00:39:26,960
little bit of uh like harry potter tales from the moss isley cantina yeah canon canon g if it's

387
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:33,200
canon g that's that's perfectly fine because when you say fan fiction i immediately think of you

388
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:40,320
know a lot of draco's throbbing member and you're thinking of slash fiction right that's synonymous

389
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:45,280
no fan fiction can be completely uh completely benign and oh yeah have you read a lot of that

390
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:51,920
well uh no you've read a lot of shadow the hedgehog fucking big the cat's asshole is what

391
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:58,720
you have read sir i love those uh shadow the hedgehog bigs the cat slash fictions yeah oh were

392
00:39:58,720 --> 00:40:01,920
you laughing because you think that's a thing that doesn't exist or are you laughing because

393
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:06,400
you know and acknowledge that that is half of all fan fiction no i was laughing because i get

394
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:11,920
actual enjoyment from reading those it makes me very happy okay good i wasn't i i think that this

395
00:40:11,920 --> 00:40:16,400
question would be more troubling wouldn't you be more troubled question asker if she was writing

396
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:21,200
two characters loosely based on you who were not dating and instead she was dating like the captain

397
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:25,120
of the quidditch team that would be more you thought that was you and then it turned out the

398
00:40:25,120 --> 00:40:30,240
capital country has like a weird mole that you don't have wait a minute wait that's not me our

399
00:40:30,240 --> 00:40:38,960
neighbor jerry has a mole though and he's great at quidditch god damn it jerry please don't take her

400
00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:45,600
just because you can i'm sorry i can't catch the golden snitch his snitches are beyond compare

401
00:40:47,840 --> 00:40:49,840
his mole is covered with gross hair

402
00:40:52,400 --> 00:41:01,520
oh jesus with ivory skin and dragons of emerald green okay i this sucks on a lot of different

403
00:41:01,520 --> 00:41:06,800
levels isn't this a great test of like a relationship that first time someone hands

404
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:12,800
you their fan fiction their manuscripts how you react that will determine the course of

405
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:20,400
your love forever can i say you guys like i secretly think i would enjoy the hell i write

406
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:25,760
in fan fiction what universe i would like to enjoy what what universe would you want to dip into

407
00:41:26,720 --> 00:41:33,120
what if i had to write fan fiction in a universe which one would i want to inhabit yes i mean i

408
00:41:33,120 --> 00:41:38,080
wrote a spec office script once which was basically this yeah so that maybe like that

409
00:41:38,080 --> 00:41:43,120
was basically well that was uh that was potentially for a job and it was a good right yeah yeah but

410
00:41:43,120 --> 00:41:48,560
isn't it all fan fiction until someone pays you for it that's a good point yeah i mean when when

411
00:41:48,560 --> 00:41:53,920
jk rowling wrote the original harry potter and the sorcerer's stone that was actually dune fan

412
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:59,360
fiction not a lot of people know that very little details had to change how house house of tradies

413
00:41:59,360 --> 00:42:04,240
was just house griffin door they just changed the name oh yeah i think i would want to dip

414
00:42:04,240 --> 00:42:10,960
into quantum leap it's so it's such a rich vein god what can't you do i would write the hell out

415
00:42:10,960 --> 00:42:15,840
of some quantum leap oh i want to do one where he leaps into santa claus travis that's a fucking

416
00:42:15,840 --> 00:42:22,880
good idea thank you justin oh and who's i'm ready to meet up with dr who i'm gonna go uh actually

i've talked about this before but how fucking good would like an adventure game series set in

428
00:43:29,600 --> 00:43:34,080
quantum leap be i think about it and i get so excited i could write that is that is that fan

429
00:43:34,080 --> 00:43:38,640
fiction are you about it telltale are you talking about like a video game scenario like yes card

430
00:43:38,640 --> 00:43:44,000
game scenario no no no video game scenario be so fucking tight i would write it for free you can

431
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:48,480
make any game into a quantum leap game by just having a scene at the beginning where he leaps

432
00:43:48,480 --> 00:43:53,600
like there's very few distinguishing features of it other than the leaping it's not like he gets

433
00:43:53,600 --> 00:43:57,520
super strength or anything cool like that you could do it right now just by editing in like

434
00:43:57,520 --> 00:44:01,840
scenes into video games where like just for one second he looks at the camera and says like oh

435
00:44:01,840 --> 00:44:06,000
boy and then you just keep going you're like holy wait hold on is this a quantum leap game

436
00:44:06,960 --> 00:44:12,880
is gold my a quantum leap game did we talk about quantum loop slash fan fiction enough that will

437
00:44:12,880 --> 00:44:16,720
actually be forced into making some because i really want to write some fan fiction isn't

438
00:44:16,720 --> 00:44:21,840

442
00:44:43,440 --> 00:44:50,000
i don't want to ruin it but i'm going down through the dozens of responses to this question dozens

443
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:56,320
of people who decided this is going to be worth their while uh it is almost entirely chris angel

444
00:44:56,320 --> 00:45:04,240
almost all in chris angel's corner serious question yeah if it was revealed that chris angel was some

445
00:45:04,240 --> 00:45:11,600
kind of like suck you incubus character some kind of actual like demon person would you be shocked

446
00:45:11,600 --> 00:45:17,200
at all if he was some sort of nephilim yes if it turned out that he was like an agent of mephistopheles

447
00:45:17,200 --> 00:45:22,480
and like had some unearthly powers if it turned out he was an agent of mr mistopheles

448
00:45:25,040 --> 00:45:31,040
if he was a jellicle cat if it turned out that he was a jellicle cat and ascended to the heavy

449
00:45:31,040 --> 00:45:36,080
time layer or whatever it's called would you be shocked let me see i'm going to show you a trick

453
00:45:56,480 --> 00:46:06,000
check out that laser pointer you want to say hold on oh yeah i tell you guys something this is truth

454
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:15,680
yeah when i was a young child i saw uh david copperfield on tv performing his uh illusion

455
00:46:15,680 --> 00:46:21,840
of flight uh perhaps one of you could wikipedia that to find out the exact year and the name of

456
00:46:21,840 --> 00:46:27,840
that special because it was something amazing but i watched his illusion of flight and in my young

457
00:46:27,840 --> 00:46:37,280
mind as a as a young boy i entertained seriously entertained for the span of a few days afterwards

458
00:46:37,840 --> 00:46:48,640
that david copperfield may maybe maybe an angel i thought wait now don't laugh no i'm going to

459
00:46:48,640 --> 00:46:56,720
fuck you no i thought that david copperfield in his special his flight 1992 perfect 12 that's

460
00:46:56,720 --> 00:47:01,840
exactly where i thought i was i i and what was the name of that special do you do you have that on

461
00:47:01,840 --> 00:47:09,520
hand uh the magic of david copperfield 14 flying hyphen live the dream calm the fuck down david

462
00:47:09,520 --> 00:47:19,600
copperfield name davey so i was so stumped by how he did this trick i entertained that he was an

463
00:47:19,600 --> 00:47:29,600
angel who has was on earth to re-convince the people that miracles can happen i thought that

464
00:47:29,600 --> 00:47:36,240
david copperfield was perhaps an angel and that was the best explanation can i just say like

465
00:47:36,240 --> 00:47:42,080
it being the 90s i'm amazed that that wasn't like a movie or a tv special or something where it's

466
00:47:42,080 --> 00:47:45,920
like you know who's popular right now that david copperfield people love the angels and stuff so

467
00:47:45,920 --> 00:47:49,440
let's make it where he's really doing magic and solving crimes that was that was actually the

468
00:47:49,440 --> 00:47:54,160
finale of the secrets of magic revealed that the masked magician who's like putting everybody on

469
00:47:54,160 --> 00:48:00,240
blast like and here's the secret behind david copperfield he's a fucking angel guys like i

470
00:48:00,240 --> 00:48:04,960
fucking i've looked at that shit through every angle and this guy's a motherfucking angel i have

471
00:48:04,960 --> 00:48:09,360
no idea why can't we see his halo that's the great magic trick he made that shit disappear

472
00:48:09,360 --> 00:48:13,520
he must have linked it with another ring and then pulled it off his fucking head he actually had to

473
00:48:13,520 --> 00:48:19,040
set he had to give up his halo when he revealed his abilities to earth people is that how it works

474
00:48:19,920 --> 00:48:28,080
in my fan fiction yesterday my roommate of five plus years walked in our room and asked to borrow

475
00:48:28,080 --> 00:48:33,360
my nail clippers like it was the most normal thing in the world i had two questions for you guys but

476
00:48:33,360 --> 00:48:39,200
first the but the answers were real obvious is that okay no how do you say no to that no you

477
00:48:39,200 --> 00:48:45,040
may not use my nail clippers the real question at the root of this is how do i figure out what

478
00:48:45,040 --> 00:48:50,160
other weird stuff he thinks is normal and that's from well please don't use my nail clippers in

479
00:48:50,160 --> 00:48:56,720
pittsburgh first off thanks for handling our light work i don't think it's that weird

480
00:48:56,720 --> 00:49:04,960
what what now the nail clipper borrowing sorry what travis yeah i know i feel like i should

481
00:49:04,960 --> 00:49:09,520
but like i think if brent in college had walked into my room and said like hey can i borrow your

482
00:49:09,520 --> 00:49:15,760
nail clippers i wouldn't have thought twice about it i would have just handed it to and said here

483
00:49:15,760 --> 00:49:22,240
you go good friend okay but when i use nail clippers i don't just like clip my nails i get

484
00:49:22,240 --> 00:49:28,320
in there yeah i get i mean i do some work in there some reconstructive work yeah you get

485
00:49:28,320 --> 00:49:35,200
out the the the speculum that's one of the attachments isn't it so is the fear that okay

486
00:49:35,200 --> 00:49:40,240
is the fear like a that their feet are so gross you're going to catch something from like their

487
00:49:40,240 --> 00:49:49,440
fingernails why do i have to spell this out for you like their nail clippers uh-huh it's gross

488
00:49:49,440 --> 00:49:52,640
everything and you're worried about the feet i'm more worried about the hands because everything

489
00:49:52,640 --> 00:49:58,000
you ever touch including your butthole is going to get under there and then it's going to get on

490
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:04,320
there and then it's going to get on your shit when you touch it what kind of honey pots of items can

491
00:50:04,320 --> 00:50:08,800
you leave around the house just to see if you'll pick them up and utilize them and make yourself

492
00:50:08,800 --> 00:50:13,840
look like a chair as you like document it and being okay use my toothbrush i need to move out

493
00:50:13,840 --> 00:50:22,240
and now you're sitting on me jerked off on my china okay it's not explicitly what that's for
