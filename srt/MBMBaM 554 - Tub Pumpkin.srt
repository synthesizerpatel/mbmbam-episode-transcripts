1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,820
The McElroy brothers are not experts and their advice should never be followed

2
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:10,580
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it

3
00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:17,660
Also, this show isn't for kids which I mentioned only so the babies out there will know how cool they are for listening

4
00:00:17,660 --> 00:00:30,660
What's up, you cool, baby?

00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:50,420
It's better, it's better with you

00:00:53,980 --> 00:00:55,980
It's better, it's better with you

7
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:02,300
It's better, it's better with you

Well spring is finally here and that can only mean one thing around this house

17
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:06,680
Which is my house where I live. Okay, it's advice season has begun spring means advice here at the McElroy family. Sure

18
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:10,800
Yeah, my my kids are always running up to me like daddy. What's uh?

19
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:15,920
What's what's a good trade skill to learn if I want to be

20
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:20,920
Valuable to society in the future and I I always tell them the same thing

21
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:23,640
stucco

22
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:28,560
See, I just started saying VR technician and I don't exactly know what that means

23
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:34,280
But I think by the time BB's old enough to get a job VR technician will be a thing, right?

24
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:41,460
Nah, people are gonna get so sick of strapping bullshit to their faces. All's it's gonna take is for one of these damn

25
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:50,040
Oculi to blow up on someone's head and then people like no, thanks, but stucco that's going absolutely nowhere, baby

26
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:57,400
Now you're saying stucco over say like somebody who was specialized in like drywall or a gypsum or even drywall

27
00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:01,200
Fucking drywall is fucking bullshit

28
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:04,880
Yeah, all stucco all the time. Now. Do I know what stucco is? I

29
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:12,980
Refuse to answer that question. Okay, I'm gonna start working that into every answer that we give just like learning trade

30
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:14,680
Okay

31
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:20,240
It's so applicable learn a trade learn how to do stuck. What do you wish you knew how to do Justin?

32
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:25,320
Cuz you know you I mean you've picked it up carpentry now, so let's let's not count that. Yeah

33
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:30,720
Yeah, drywall. No, we already discussed. It's kind of like I already said drywall

34
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:35,320
But I was just saying I also would like to learn how to do drywall. Yeah, see for me

35
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:41,480
It's electrics and I'll tell you why oh don't fuck around with that. Yeah, but here's here's the thing

36
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:46,760
I feel like if you don't know what you're doing with plumbing and you don't know what you're doing with drywall and you don't

37
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:50,440
Know what you're doing with a lot of things. The worst you're going to do is ruin it

38
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:55,440
If you don't know what you're doing with electrics, you could die and kill others

39
00:03:55,600 --> 00:04:00,720
Well, if you could make a big enough plumbing, well, I could make a big enough plumbing whoopsie to die

40
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:04,800
I bet like a low poison of mold that is huge

41
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:11,680
I'm saying I break the toilet so bad the water shoots up at me with such force it just it kills me

42
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:13,680
That's that's entirely possible

43
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:17,760
But I could never learn plumbing because I would always be afraid that no matter what

44
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:24,520
Fixture I'm working on where the pipe is that I'm doing it. I'm gonna remove it and water's gonna come out and also

45
00:04:25,980 --> 00:04:29,620
Human waste even if it's like the kitchen sink pipes

46
00:04:29,620 --> 00:04:34,040
I do not know how the water gets there where it's coming from. You know what? I mean?

47
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:37,100
I don't know anything about plumbing but but yeah

48
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:41,520
Movies and TV have convinced me that if I remove something wrong

49
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:48,520
It will spray at me with such force. It might cause me physical pain. You could die. That's what I'm saying stucco though

50
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:53,160
Fully safe you could eat that stuff. I bet I was about to ask if you could eat it

51
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:55,620
Yeah, I'm sure it's got it's got nutrients

52
00:04:55,720 --> 00:05:01,000
They and they would call me the stucco bucko and I would roll up on their house and I would put stucco all over it

53
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,600
And they'd be like we had exposed brick and I would say

54
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:07,120
Not anymore. You don't know you have hidden brick

55
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:14,120
Are we fucking are we done? Are we like are we like I this?

56
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:17,160
I feel like the last few intros has been like discussing

57
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:24,960
Finances and now we're it's literally home and we're literally making home improvement to we're literally making

58
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:29,320
Well, the problem is we haven't had any new input in about 13 months

59
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:36,320
Yeah, I've heard some people I've read on Twitter. Some people are like the quality of the show has really been flagging that well

60
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:39,920
That's weird since I began my self imprisonment. Yeah

61
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:47,200
My year-long self imprisonment the the the laughs haven't been as plentiful on the show

62
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:51,760
All I've got is like hey, have you ever noticed how on this one wall next to my desk?

63
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:56,560
There's this weird discoloration that kind of looks a little bit like dick butt kiss, you know

64
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:58,560
Like that's the best I've got at this point

65
00:05:58,840 --> 00:06:05,440
But don't worry folks as soon as I get that good juice in my arm. I'm talking about that Johnson and Johnson shit

66
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:07,440
I am going to

67
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:08,720
way

68
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:13,800
Overcorrect, so just stick with us cuz I'm gonna I'm gonna start going to raves and shit

69
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:20,480
Like it's gonna be it's gonna be something to see. Yeah, I've got the juice. I've got the juice

70
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:27,160
It's pumping through me. I ain't afraid of no bugs, right? I got the juice. It's pumping through me. There's nothing to do

71
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:33,840
It's I got I went outside for a little bit. I was like, I remember this this was fine, too

72
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:39,320
Yeah, but like the masks I can't tell if you're smart. I have a hard enough time with emotions

73
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:44,360
Yeah, you know what I mean figuring out how people are feeling and now I'm looking at these strangers eyes trying to guess how much

74
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:46,360
They dislike me, right?

75
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:51,480
It's very stressful, you know speaking of this can I can I begin with a much quad? Oh, yeah

76
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:56,440
Oh, yeah, I

77
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:01,880
Want a much

78
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:06,040
What I want a much

79
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:14,100
Squad squad so excited about this. Are you all excited about this? Are you so excited that you just said I want a munch

80
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:21,620
It's the my lunch school one with your host Justin

81
00:07:22,100 --> 00:07:27,660
Did you hear what Krispy Kreme's doing? What's Krispy Kreme doing? Hey, you guys hear about this you guys hear about this

82
00:07:27,660 --> 00:07:31,060
You hear about this is a good. This is a good one. This one will make you happy

83
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:33,160
Okay

84
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:37,460
Krispy Kreme's got a new got a new promotion going on where if you get the job

85
00:07:37,460 --> 00:07:43,540
You get the vaccine. Uh-huh. You're gonna come in for a year and get free donut every day. Whoa

86
00:07:44,020 --> 00:07:47,540
Why show them your for you? Show them your vaccination card?

87
00:07:47,540 --> 00:07:52,940
You're gonna get a free original glazed donut every single day for a year

88
00:07:53,060 --> 00:07:57,340
You're doing something good for you doing something good for your community doing something bad for you

89
00:07:57,340 --> 00:08:07,060
Circular circular that's here's how it works you bring in your vaccine card to a Krispy Kreme

90
00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:10,260
You get one free original glazed donut

91
00:08:11,020 --> 00:08:13,520
That's the promotion every day though for a year

92
00:08:14,740 --> 00:08:18,620
Yeah, so I I hear your questions and we're gonna head to the FAQ

93
00:08:18,620 --> 00:08:26,700
What call here's the first cue what qualifies is vaccinated? Oh, that's a bad start. That's a bad start

94
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:31,920
Anyone who has received at least one of the two shots of Moderna or Pfizer?

95
00:08:32,260 --> 00:08:37,040
COVID-19 vaccine or one shot of the Johnson & Johnson COVID-19 vaccine now

96
00:08:37,040 --> 00:08:39,940
I am rocking this off-brand AstraZeneca

97
00:08:42,100 --> 00:08:45,900
Legal yeah, this is not a promotion that I could take advantage of right now

98
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:52,340
You know the approves you've been vaccinated by showing them your vaccination record card. Okay?

99
00:08:53,340 --> 00:09:00,620
Does my vaccine sticker qualify now if you get a sticker that says I got vaccinated that's nothing

100
00:09:01,300 --> 00:09:03,660
To Krispy Kreme. That's nothing

101
00:09:04,260 --> 00:09:10,500
Right. I guess my question is is this a like government subsidized like program how?

102
00:09:11,460 --> 00:09:14,180
Yeah, how is Krispy Kreme not going to go out of business?

103
00:09:14,180 --> 00:09:15,380
Oh

104
00:09:15,380 --> 00:09:18,660
Well, I guess they're banking on a lot of people not getting vaccinated

105
00:09:19,380 --> 00:09:22,760
Everybody who doesn't give vaccinated as money in their coffers

106
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:24,760
So this is kind of hedging their bets either

107
00:09:25,300 --> 00:09:29,300
Either it's good because everybody gets vaccinated or it's good because not as many people take their free down

108
00:09:29,300 --> 00:09:34,120
But this is what I'm saying if at every Krispy Kreme location only 20 people do this, right?

109
00:09:34,420 --> 00:09:36,880
That's that's right there. What?

110
00:09:37,940 --> 00:09:39,940
7,200 doughnuts in a year

111
00:09:39,940 --> 00:09:45,420
My hurt times the amount of Krispy Kreme locations. That's just lost money

112
00:09:46,020 --> 00:09:48,140
Yeah, it's lost money, but it's also like not

113
00:09:48,820 --> 00:09:50,760
Great, I think

114
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:55,940
To eat a free Krispy Kreme donut every day. Well, sure think that that's great for your overall well-being

115
00:09:56,060 --> 00:09:58,060
It can be part of a well-balanced

116
00:09:58,780 --> 00:10:02,500
Eating plan, but hey, listen, let's let's sneak on down the FAQ

117
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:07,180
Come with me go walk past those regular queues and let's get to a LFAQ

118
00:10:07,180 --> 00:10:14,420
Let's get to a LFAQ less frequently. Yes. Come on. This is really the point where I decided to talk about this

119
00:10:15,180 --> 00:10:19,100
Here's the LFAQ this less frequently asked question. What if

120
00:10:19,100 --> 00:10:45,100
What if I don't want to get vaccinated, can I still do this. It's so awesome. Free doughnuts. Yes. Yes. Here for that. Love it, love it, love it.

121
00:10:45,100 --> 00:11:05,660
Is there a scientifically proven vaccine that's completely safe and will prevent me from getting COVID and help me prevent the spread of the disease and protect my loved ones. I'm not crazy about that. I'm not sure about that one, Kris. But I do like doughnuts. I love freebies. I want to participate in the program. Don't get me wrong, Kris. I want the free doughnut. I need the A for that LFAQ. Here's the A

122
00:11:06,380 --> 00:11:11,860
We understand that choosing to receive the COVID-19 vaccine is a highly personal decision

123
00:11:11,860 --> 00:11:24,780
No. We advise all employees and guests to consult with their health care provider regarding whether to obtain a COVID-19 vaccination and which vaccine to receive after reviewing the available information.

124
00:11:24,780 --> 00:11:43,780
If you have made the personal decision to not receive the COVID-19 vaccine, please visit us on Mondays, March 29th through May 24th to receive a free original glazed doughnut and a medium brewed coffee.

125
00:11:43,780 --> 00:11:58,780
Get your week off to a good start. They're having a rumpus. They're having Buckwild Mondays where the promotion is come get your free doughnut and a free coffee. That's a better deal.

126
00:11:58,780 --> 00:12:11,780
We want to pack in all the nasty folks on this one day. All you ribbled motherfuckers that don't want to get the jab. You just all come in and get one swampy morass of free doughnuts and illness.

127
00:12:11,780 --> 00:12:23,780
Here's the thing. Krispy Kreme takes one quarter of a bold stance by saying, I'll give you a doughnut for your vaccine every day. And then they back it way, way up. They take one step forward and eight steps back.

128
00:12:23,780 --> 00:12:35,780
What they should do is say you get a free doughnut every day for a year if you get the vaccination. And if you don't get the vaccination, you owe us one doughnut every day for a year.

129
00:12:35,780 --> 00:12:40,780
And that's how we pay this off. This is how we swap this out. A doughnut for a doughnut.

130
00:12:40,780 --> 00:12:48,780
Yeah, because right now they're calling up President Joey, President Joey Bag of Doughnuts, and saying like, you're fucking killing us, dude. Can you chill?

131
00:12:48,780 --> 00:12:58,780
Like the last dude, he sucked shit. But like, he also wasn't sort of taking us apart at every sort of level by getting all these jabs going.

132
00:12:58,780 --> 00:13:08,780
So anyway, that's the promotion. Krispy Kreme, I love the idea. Do wish you had a little bit of a strengthier convictions there, y'all.

133
00:13:08,780 --> 00:13:17,780
Just a little bit more, because you don't get free coffee if you get the jab. You only get the free coffee if you're a dirty little dog.

134
00:13:17,780 --> 00:13:23,780
Yeah, isn't that strange? Isn't that strange that you get the coffee?

135
00:13:23,780 --> 00:13:26,780
Wait, guys, is it possible the coffee has the vaccine in it?

136
00:13:26,780 --> 00:13:35,780
That's entirely possible. I mean, it could also be possible that they're setting up like a toddler hangout, let's spread this chicken pox all around and just get it done with.

137
00:13:35,780 --> 00:13:38,780
I see. We're forcing the herd immunity here.

138
00:13:38,780 --> 00:13:44,780
And I just hope they are providing the correct sort of protective gear for the employees at Krispy Kreme.

139
00:13:44,780 --> 00:13:48,780
Well, you go and you get your free donut and your free coffee, right? But then when you leave, what's that?

140
00:13:48,780 --> 00:13:53,780
You're being ushered into the back of a big box truck. Oh, what? Where are we going?

141
00:13:53,780 --> 00:13:57,780
Well, this is going to be a farm where all the people who don't care about vaccines can live.

142
00:13:57,780 --> 00:14:00,780
And you won't be able to get everybody else infected, you dirty dogs.

143
00:14:00,780 --> 00:14:02,780
Will there be free donuts?

144
00:14:02,780 --> 00:14:05,780
There will be some kind of food.

145
00:14:05,780 --> 00:14:06,780
Yeah.

146
00:14:06,780 --> 00:14:08,780
You won't have to pay for it.

147
00:14:08,780 --> 00:14:11,780
You're going to be happy here. Don't worry about it.

148
00:14:11,780 --> 00:14:13,780
It's going to be fine.

149
00:14:13,780 --> 00:14:19,780
Let's get into the advice. I'm ready to help some people and I want to start with this one.

150
00:14:19,780 --> 00:14:21,780
An excellent question here.

151
00:14:21,780 --> 00:14:27,780
When I was in second grade, Shaquille O'Neal came to my school to have a Q&A with the kids.

152
00:14:27,780 --> 00:14:31,780
I was chosen to ask him a question. I asked it, then sat down.

153
00:14:31,780 --> 00:14:35,780
The thing is, after some of the other kids asked a question, he would give them a kiss on the cheek.

154
00:14:35,780 --> 00:14:37,780
Is this real?

155
00:14:37,780 --> 00:14:46,780
I feel like if Shaquille O'Neal went to schools a lot and kissed a lot of kids on the cheek, we would have heard about it by now.

156
00:14:46,780 --> 00:14:49,780
Well, keep going because the details lead me to believe this is real.

157
00:14:49,780 --> 00:14:51,780
Yeah, the details stack up.

158
00:14:51,780 --> 00:14:54,780
If I ever meet him again, do I ask for it? No.

159
00:14:54,780 --> 00:14:59,780
Do I relay the story and go at it coy, go for a European greeting and hope he reciprocates,

160
00:14:59,780 --> 00:15:01,780
or just forget the whole thing altogether?

161
00:15:01,780 --> 00:15:02,780
Not that one.

162
00:15:02,780 --> 00:15:04,780
That's from reflecting in the red stick.

163
00:15:04,780 --> 00:15:08,780
P.S. I asked him if he was allergic to strawberries. I had no idea who he was.

164
00:15:08,780 --> 00:15:13,780
I was talking with my mom about my mom's allergies in the car on the way there, and I was just curious.

165
00:15:13,780 --> 00:15:15,780
It was actually a clip for the news. He is not.

166
00:15:15,780 --> 00:15:21,780
Okay, that's good to know. I was worried. Thank you for letting me know that Mr. Shaquille O'Neal is not allergic to strawberries.

167
00:15:21,780 --> 00:15:27,780
I like that you, as a second grader, saw this giant man.

168
00:15:27,780 --> 00:15:30,780
People were excited that he was there, and you thought,

169
00:15:30,780 --> 00:15:35,780
I wonder if this giant man is allergic to strawberries. No further questions.

170
00:15:35,780 --> 00:15:39,780
That was the question. That was your – God almighty.

171
00:15:39,780 --> 00:15:46,780
If you had one chance to ask Shaquille O'Neal a question, for me it would be,

172
00:15:46,780 --> 00:15:49,780
what do you like better, The General or Papa John's?

173
00:15:49,780 --> 00:15:51,780
Which of your business things are you more into?

174
00:15:51,780 --> 00:15:52,780
You have to choose.

175
00:15:52,780 --> 00:15:59,780
I've seen all the commercials. Can you explain to me what The General is and why they made –

176
00:15:59,780 --> 00:16:07,780
they have you as their spokesperson, but they also have a fucking Allie McBeal CGI baby general man as the mascot.

177
00:16:07,780 --> 00:16:10,780
Can you explain – isn't that redundant, Mr. O'Neal?

178
00:16:10,780 --> 00:16:14,780
Do you think that there's a chance, because of the specificity of the question,

179
00:16:14,780 --> 00:16:17,780
that if you did run into Mr. Shaquille O'Neal now and you said,

180
00:16:17,780 --> 00:16:22,780
I was the kid, you came to my second grade class, I asked you about strawberries,

181
00:16:22,780 --> 00:16:26,780
and Shaquille O'Neal would be like, of course I remember you. I owe you one kiss on the cheek.

182
00:16:26,780 --> 00:16:30,780
I was just so befuddled in the moment by the specificity of your question,

183
00:16:30,780 --> 00:16:33,780
I forgot to give you a cheek kiss as is my way.

184
00:16:33,780 --> 00:16:38,780
Yeah. If I saw Shaq and I could ask him a question,

185
00:16:38,780 --> 00:16:41,780
I'd like to think it would be something urbane and erudite,

186
00:16:41,780 --> 00:16:48,780
but I think it would just be kind of like a – I would just be so relieved to get the chance

187
00:16:48,780 --> 00:16:51,780
that it would be something like, where do I go from here, Shaq?

188
00:16:51,780 --> 00:16:52,780
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

189
00:16:52,780 --> 00:16:57,780
You know what I mean? Like, hey Shaq, where do we go from here?

190
00:16:57,780 --> 00:16:58,780
What's next?

191
00:16:58,780 --> 00:17:01,780
What's next? Hey Shaq, what's next?

192
00:17:01,780 --> 00:17:08,780
See, I think my question, I'd want it to be – I'd want it to be funny, right, and kind of like ironic.

193
00:17:08,780 --> 00:17:10,780
Oh, you'd want to get him in stitches.

194
00:17:10,780 --> 00:17:15,780
Yeah, I'd want it to be like, did you ever fully become Jin? Right? Something like that.

195
00:17:15,780 --> 00:17:18,780
Yeah, that'd be a good one. I bet he'd never heard that one before.

196
00:17:18,780 --> 00:17:26,780
But I think in all honesty, if I now, even as a 37-year-old adult, ran into Mr. Shaquille O'Neal,

197
00:17:26,780 --> 00:17:29,780
I think – and someone like whispered in my ear like, you got one chance, one question.

198
00:17:29,780 --> 00:17:32,780
I think it would just be like, how's it going? Like, I think that's the best thing.

199
00:17:32,780 --> 00:17:34,780
You wouldn't do that. No, you would have some of the best –

200
00:17:34,780 --> 00:17:37,780
Travis, I've got a microphone. I'm putting it in your face right now.

201
00:17:37,780 --> 00:17:40,780
Ask a question of Shaquille O'Neal. Don't think about it. Just ask.

202
00:17:40,780 --> 00:17:44,780
Travis? You're thinking.

203
00:17:44,780 --> 00:17:47,780
You're right. Okay. Hey, can you give that to me again, please?

204
00:17:47,780 --> 00:17:51,780
Yeah. Travis, here's a microphone. I've got Shaquille O'Neal.

205
00:17:51,780 --> 00:17:54,780
Hi, Travis. You can ask him one question.

206
00:17:54,780 --> 00:17:57,780
What was it like to be beaten by Aaron Carter?

207
00:17:57,780 --> 00:18:03,780
That is a fucking slam dunk. Now, I do appreciate that my metaphor there was good.

208
00:18:03,780 --> 00:18:11,780
I appreciate that that just came to me, but I would love to force Shaq to relive the day that Aaron Carter –

209
00:18:11,780 --> 00:18:17,780
Yeah. Here's the thing. Okay, it is occurring to me now how many wonderful things –

210
00:18:17,780 --> 00:18:23,780
like, how many – there's Shaq Fu. There's how I beat Shaq. There's Kazam.

211
00:18:23,780 --> 00:18:25,780
There's just like this – and I believe he was –

212
00:18:25,780 --> 00:18:29,780
There's the Papa John thing where he renamed them all to Shaka Johns or whatever he called it.

213
00:18:29,780 --> 00:18:31,780
I think he was in Space Jam 1, right?

214
00:18:31,780 --> 00:18:33,780
No. Probably.

215
00:18:33,780 --> 00:18:36,780
He was not. He was in Steel, though, as –

216
00:18:36,780 --> 00:18:37,780
Steel.

217
00:18:37,780 --> 00:18:38,780
From Steel?

218
00:18:38,780 --> 00:18:46,780
It was a storied, like, able-to-be-referenced life Shaquille O'Neal has led, and –

219
00:18:46,780 --> 00:18:49,780
You don't have an ending to that thought, do you? You just want to talk about how great –

220
00:18:49,780 --> 00:18:51,780
No, I just want to talk about how great Shaq is.

221
00:18:51,780 --> 00:18:52,780
Yeah.

222
00:18:52,780 --> 00:18:58,780
I mean, here's the thing. There will be people like our question asker who may have no idea that Shaquille O'Neal ever played basketball.

223
00:18:58,780 --> 00:18:59,780
Interesting.

224
00:18:59,780 --> 00:19:05,780
He is just the guy who was in that Genie movie and played Steel, and he's in those general commercials.

225
00:19:05,780 --> 00:19:09,780
And remember that video game about him where I believe he beat up Godzilla or something?

226
00:19:09,780 --> 00:19:16,780
Like, that there are so many things Shaquille O'Neal – like, he could have just been very good at basketball.

227
00:19:16,780 --> 00:19:22,780
And he said, no, no. I have so much more Shaqs to give. Let me do other, weirder things.

228
00:19:22,780 --> 00:19:31,780
Hey! 2020. Summer 2020. A woman has a blowout. Tire has a blowout. Has to pull over to the side of the road. Who's there to assist?

229
00:19:31,780 --> 00:19:32,780
Is it Shaq?

230
00:19:32,780 --> 00:19:34,780
It's Shaq. Shaq pulls over to help.

231
00:19:34,780 --> 00:19:35,780
More great stuff.

232
00:19:35,780 --> 00:19:38,780
Shaq doesn't give a – if there's any cars, they'll just punch them out of the way.

233
00:19:38,780 --> 00:19:39,780
Right.

234
00:19:39,780 --> 00:19:41,780
Protect everybody.

235
00:19:41,780 --> 00:19:49,780
How about this? And this is – we've completely lost the plot of this question. I hope that's okay, because now we're just kind of having fun with it.

236
00:19:49,780 --> 00:19:56,780
But what if they did a new thing of Deal or No Deal, but then he was the host and it was called Shaquille or No Deal?

237
00:19:56,780 --> 00:19:57,780
Ooh, I like that.

238
00:19:57,780 --> 00:20:00,780
Or Shaquille O'Neal is another option.

239
00:20:00,780 --> 00:20:01,780
Uh-huh.

240
00:20:01,780 --> 00:20:06,780
That was a lot of fun talking – hey, guys, sometimes it's just fun to talk about Shaq for a bit.

241
00:20:06,780 --> 00:20:08,780
Yeah, we do it a lot. Have you noticed that?

242
00:20:08,780 --> 00:20:11,780
Yeah, we sure, we do. Do you want a Yahoo?

243
00:20:11,780 --> 00:20:12,780
Yeah.

244
00:20:12,780 --> 00:20:19,780
This one was sent in by Graham Roebuck – thank you, Graham, crushes – from Yahoo Answers user Emily, who asks,

245
00:20:19,780 --> 00:20:23,780
why did nature mess with dolphins this bad?

246
00:20:23,780 --> 00:20:25,780
Yes, thank you.

247
00:20:25,780 --> 00:20:29,780
They have to live in the water. They can't walk, but they have to go up for air every ten minutes?

248
00:20:29,780 --> 00:20:31,780
How could nature do that to them?

249
00:20:31,780 --> 00:20:32,780
Okay, listen.

250
00:20:32,780 --> 00:20:34,780
That sucks. Can you imagine if you had to leave –

251
00:20:34,780 --> 00:20:37,780
Yeah, I wish I could goof on this, but that's pretty fucked up.

252
00:20:37,780 --> 00:20:43,780
What if you had to leave your house every ten minutes to step outside and breathe and then go back inside your house?

253
00:20:43,780 --> 00:20:44,780
If it was that case –

254
00:20:44,780 --> 00:20:46,780
You basically decide the existence of a smoker.

255
00:20:46,780 --> 00:20:51,780
Well, but it's more like, hey, step outside, stick your head in that fountain, now come back inside.

256
00:20:51,780 --> 00:20:57,780
Oh, that's right. It's not even the same sort of physical substance.

257
00:20:57,780 --> 00:21:00,780
And it's like, hey, can I bring it inside my house? No, no, no, no.

258
00:21:00,780 --> 00:21:01,780
No.

259
00:21:01,780 --> 00:21:03,780
If you bring it in there, it'll immediately go away. It disappears.

260
00:21:03,780 --> 00:21:08,780
It is – how did nature – okay, now see, now I'm thinking about it.

261
00:21:08,780 --> 00:21:14,780
Because if you're dolphins and you're trying to figure it out, and you have to save the other dolphins.

262
00:21:14,780 --> 00:21:19,780
Okay, you guys are going to think I'm crazy, but I do think I cracked it.

263
00:21:19,780 --> 00:21:21,780
We're supposed to be in both.

264
00:21:21,780 --> 00:21:22,780
Yeah.

265
00:21:22,780 --> 00:21:25,780
Like, wait, what? Do you mean the dry or the wet?

266
00:21:25,780 --> 00:21:27,780
No, no, no. This is the wild part.

267
00:21:27,780 --> 00:21:29,780
It's going to say, I don't want to fuck with you. Both.

268
00:21:29,780 --> 00:21:30,780
Yeah.

269
00:21:30,780 --> 00:21:32,780
Like, we have to be in the wet for a while. Nobody else has to do that.

270
00:21:32,780 --> 00:21:33,780
All these fish.

271
00:21:33,780 --> 00:21:34,780
We do.

272
00:21:34,780 --> 00:21:35,780
Whales.

273
00:21:35,780 --> 00:21:36,780
Turtles.

274
00:21:36,780 --> 00:21:38,780
Whales do have to do that.

275
00:21:38,780 --> 00:21:39,780
Nobody else.

276
00:21:39,780 --> 00:21:40,780
I mean, there's probably a lot.

277
00:21:40,780 --> 00:21:42,780
Dolphins don't know about whales.

278
00:21:42,780 --> 00:21:43,780
You're right.

279
00:21:43,780 --> 00:21:45,780
I'm pretty sure dolphins know about whales.

280
00:21:45,780 --> 00:21:46,780
Oh my god, we've definitely –

281
00:21:46,780 --> 00:21:49,780
You see a fucking giant dolphin, you're going to turn around and run.

282
00:21:49,780 --> 00:21:52,780
You're not going to ask him his life story and if he's in the dry and the wet in an equal amount of time. No way.

283
00:21:52,780 --> 00:21:53,780
We have for sure –

284
00:21:53,780 --> 00:21:54,780
Dolphins don't know about whales.

285
00:21:54,780 --> 00:21:58,780
We have for sure had this exact discussion before, which is wild to me.

286
00:21:58,780 --> 00:21:59,780
No, we haven't.

287
00:21:59,780 --> 00:22:02,780
I don't think dolphins would hang out with whales. I don't think whales would hang out with dolphins.

288
00:22:02,780 --> 00:22:03,780
Absolutely not. They'd be afraid.

289
00:22:03,780 --> 00:22:07,780
I think whales would find the dolphins a little much. You know what I mean?

290
00:22:07,780 --> 00:22:11,780
You're a whale. You're moving at your own pace. You're doing things.

291
00:22:11,780 --> 00:22:17,780
I guess just floating forward until you die or make another smaller you because there's not –

292
00:22:17,780 --> 00:22:18,780
There's not a whole lot else to do.

293
00:22:18,780 --> 00:22:19,780
Like, you're not obtaining great works of art or whatever.

294
00:22:19,780 --> 00:22:20,780
Sure.

295
00:22:20,780 --> 00:22:24,780
And then you see a dolphin come over and they're doing like flips and tricks and shit and you're like, oh my god.

296
00:22:24,780 --> 00:22:25,780
Oh man.

297
00:22:25,780 --> 00:22:26,780
Could you not?

298
00:22:26,780 --> 00:22:30,780
I'm going to do that. Whoop, splash. And then they post a video online that's like, look at this big whale.

299
00:22:30,780 --> 00:22:36,780
Do it – jump out and do a huge splash. And that whale sees the video and he's like, I was trying to do a cool flip like my friend dolphin.

300
00:22:36,780 --> 00:22:37,780
Yeah.

301
00:22:37,780 --> 00:22:38,780
Do you think that when dolphins –

302
00:22:38,780 --> 00:22:39,780
I'm still like an asshole.

303
00:22:39,780 --> 00:22:46,780
When dolphins see us in our scubas swimming around and like staying underwater for longer than 10 –

304
00:22:46,780 --> 00:22:51,780
Do you think dolphins ever trail scuba divers like, Jeremy, check this out.

305
00:22:51,780 --> 00:22:57,780
That dude, he's been down here for like 20 fucking minutes and I know he likes air.

306
00:22:57,780 --> 00:23:03,780
Like, I know he loves the air as much as we do. So like, what's going on?

307
00:23:03,780 --> 00:23:12,780
And the other side of that though is like when they see a shark who can stay down the whole time, they're probably like, what the fuck?

308
00:23:12,780 --> 00:23:15,780
Why can't – hey, why can't we do that?

309
00:23:15,780 --> 00:23:16,780
Hey.

310
00:23:16,780 --> 00:23:17,780
Yeah.

311
00:23:17,780 --> 00:23:18,780
It's not fair.

312
00:23:18,780 --> 00:23:19,780
Have we tried just staying down –

313
00:23:19,780 --> 00:23:21,780
I can't.

314
00:23:21,780 --> 00:23:25,780
They got cuts on them that they do it through, so I guess – hey, cut me.

315
00:23:25,780 --> 00:23:27,780
Ow, fuck. That didn't work.

316
00:23:27,780 --> 00:23:29,780
That's not it.

317
00:23:29,780 --> 00:23:32,780
Oh shit, he's got a lot of cuts though. Okay, do it six times real fast.

318
00:23:32,780 --> 00:23:33,780
Ow, fuck.

319
00:23:33,780 --> 00:23:34,780
No, it's just my –

320
00:23:34,780 --> 00:23:35,780
Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow.

321
00:23:35,780 --> 00:23:37,780
Guys, the red is coming out.

322
00:23:37,780 --> 00:23:39,780
It's the inside wet. The inside wet.

323
00:23:39,780 --> 00:23:42,780
The inside wet's coming out. The air's not going in.

324
00:23:42,780 --> 00:23:44,780
Ah, man.

325
00:23:44,780 --> 00:23:45,780
This sucks.

326
00:23:45,780 --> 00:23:50,780
There's a lot of shitty answers on this question, by the way. A lot of shitty answers.

327
00:23:50,780 --> 00:23:51,780
Unsurprising.

328
00:23:51,780 --> 00:23:54,780
So dolphins have to breathe every ten minutes? Why did nature mess with us?

329
00:23:54,780 --> 00:23:57,780
We have to breathe every few seconds. Occasionally we can hold our breath for a few minutes.

330
00:23:57,780 --> 00:23:59,780
Hey, dumb-dumb, hey.

331
00:23:59,780 --> 00:24:00,780
That's not the point.

332
00:24:00,780 --> 00:24:01,780
That's not the fucking point.

333
00:24:01,780 --> 00:24:02,780
You live in the dry.

334
00:24:02,780 --> 00:24:05,780
Listen, someone else says goodbye and thanks for all the fish.

335
00:24:05,780 --> 00:24:10,780
42.

336
00:24:10,780 --> 00:24:13,780
Pretty good though, the one you said.

337
00:24:13,780 --> 00:24:15,780
Does it say goodbye and thanks for all the fish?

338
00:24:15,780 --> 00:24:16,780
Yeah, it's not even the right fucking –

339
00:24:16,780 --> 00:24:18,780
I couldn't even get the line right.

340
00:24:18,780 --> 00:24:25,780
But there is a rad pic of just a slimy gray dolphin he's poking out of the water.

341
00:24:25,780 --> 00:24:28,780
He's got a big smile and it says, they look pretty happy to me.

342
00:24:28,780 --> 00:24:33,780
And I want to tell that person that is just kind of what their mouth looks like.

343
00:24:33,780 --> 00:24:40,780
And for all we know, this dolphin is a circus dolphin and is probably not living his best life.

344
00:24:40,780 --> 00:24:47,780
Okay, but they do look happy.

345
00:24:47,780 --> 00:24:51,780
But again, Justin, I do want to say what I literally just said eight seconds ago.

346
00:24:51,780 --> 00:24:52,780
Yeah, but they look happy.

347
00:24:52,780 --> 00:24:57,780
Is it possible that the balance is something we can learn from that?

348
00:24:57,780 --> 00:24:58,780
But it's not balance, Justin.

349
00:24:58,780 --> 00:24:59,780
Don't spend all your time in one.

350
00:24:59,780 --> 00:25:02,780
Don't spend all your time in the wet or the dry. Find a balance.

351
00:25:02,780 --> 00:25:03,780
But it's not balance, Justin.

352
00:25:03,780 --> 00:25:07,780
They live 99% of the time in the wet.

353
00:25:07,780 --> 00:25:13,780
They're not rolling up on the land walking around for a while and then going back into the wet, Justin.

354
00:25:13,780 --> 00:25:17,780
They're in the wet and they have to basically stick their backs up.

355
00:25:17,780 --> 00:25:24,780
If every 10 minutes you had to push the back of your head through your wall to live, that fucking sucks.

356
00:25:24,780 --> 00:25:28,780
It's not balanced.

357
00:25:28,780 --> 00:25:32,780
And yet you're over here telling me evolution is real, Justin.

358
00:25:32,780 --> 00:25:37,780
But if evolution is so real, then how come dolphins haven't evolved to breathe water?

359
00:25:37,780 --> 00:25:40,780
Well, because then we wouldn't be able to see them as much.

360
00:25:40,780 --> 00:25:41,780
Oh, that's a good point.

361
00:25:41,780 --> 00:25:42,780
No, they evolved for us.

362
00:25:42,780 --> 00:25:43,780
That's something for us.

363
00:25:43,780 --> 00:25:44,780
They evolved for us.

364
00:25:44,780 --> 00:25:45,780
They miss us, too.

365
00:25:45,780 --> 00:25:46,780
Yeah, they love us.

366
00:25:46,780 --> 00:25:47,780
That's our thing.

367
00:25:47,780 --> 00:25:50,780
They evolved blowholes to come up and see us, to have an excuse.

368
00:25:50,780 --> 00:25:54,780
So what you're saying, Justin, is there was a time when dolphins lived on land and they hung out with human beings.

369
00:25:54,780 --> 00:25:58,780
And they said, we want to spend a lot of time in the wet, but we don't want to miss you entirely.

370
00:25:58,780 --> 00:26:00,780
And that's how they evolved?

371
00:26:00,780 --> 00:26:01,780
Maybe.

372
00:26:01,780 --> 00:26:05,780
The order of occurrences is something of a mystery.

373
00:26:05,780 --> 00:26:08,780
So it might have been that they were underwater the whole time and they said, what's up there?

374
00:26:08,780 --> 00:26:10,780
I want to be part of that world.

375
00:26:10,780 --> 00:26:14,780
And they made a deal with Ursula, and Ursula gave them blowholes so they could come up and say hi.

376
00:26:14,780 --> 00:26:15,780
But she took their voice.

377
00:26:15,780 --> 00:26:17,780
God, I'm so sick of her.

378
00:26:17,780 --> 00:26:18,780
I know, right?

379
00:26:18,780 --> 00:26:20,780
Ruins it for everybody.

380
00:26:20,780 --> 00:26:24,780
We have fun, but she took that lady's voice away.

381
00:26:24,780 --> 00:26:26,780
She took her fucking voice away.

382
00:26:26,780 --> 00:26:28,780
So she could go see a man she never met.

383
00:26:28,780 --> 00:26:30,780
Ursula knew what the fuck was up.

384
00:26:30,780 --> 00:26:32,780
Ursula knew she wasn't coming back.

385
00:26:32,780 --> 00:26:37,780
A lot of people like to treat Ursula like the hero of the story, but I'm sorry.

386
00:26:37,780 --> 00:26:40,780
I think she's the villain.

387
00:26:40,780 --> 00:26:41,780
Yeah.

388
00:26:41,780 --> 00:26:43,780
Well, she does get killed by a big boat.

389
00:26:43,780 --> 00:26:44,780
That is true.

390
00:26:44,780 --> 00:26:45,780
For her crimes.

391
00:26:45,780 --> 00:26:46,780
It's a fair point.

392
00:26:46,780 --> 00:26:49,780
You guys ever think about what a shitty dad Triton was?

393
00:26:49,780 --> 00:26:50,780
He was not great.

394
00:26:50,780 --> 00:26:52,780
I don't want to talk about that.

395
00:26:52,780 --> 00:26:53,780
Should we go to the Money Town?

396
00:26:53,780 --> 00:26:54,780
Yeah.

397
00:26:54,780 --> 00:26:55,780
Great.

398
00:26:55,780 --> 00:27:10,780
Let's go.

399
00:27:10,780 --> 00:27:12,780
Hey, you want to fill your belly?

400
00:27:12,780 --> 00:27:14,780
Why not fill it with a basket of sun?

401
00:27:14,780 --> 00:27:15,780
Oh, okay.

402
00:27:15,780 --> 00:27:18,780
I was going to say it depends on what is going in there.

403
00:27:18,780 --> 00:27:19,780
No, it's sun.

404
00:27:19,780 --> 00:27:20,780
Pure sunshine.

405
00:27:20,780 --> 00:27:27,780
We've partnered with the best scientist at Sun Basket to bring you a basket full of pure photons.

406
00:27:27,780 --> 00:27:28,780
They're going to fill your belly up.

407
00:27:28,780 --> 00:27:30,780
You're going to eat sunlight.

408
00:27:30,780 --> 00:27:31,780
It's not true.

409
00:27:31,780 --> 00:27:32,780
It's so stupid.

410
00:27:32,780 --> 00:27:33,780
It's not true.

411
00:27:33,780 --> 00:27:34,780
It's sunlight.

412
00:27:34,780 --> 00:27:35,780
No, it's not, Travis.

413
00:27:35,780 --> 00:27:39,780
It's delicious food that's sent to you, and then you make it, and it makes you happy.

414
00:27:39,780 --> 00:27:43,780
Last night, I had – I didn't – here's – you want to know something wild about Sun Basket?

415
00:27:43,780 --> 00:27:44,780
What?

416
00:27:44,780 --> 00:27:45,780
Here's what they sent me.

417
00:27:45,780 --> 00:27:49,780
Chicken romesco sauce with green beans and tomatoes.

418
00:27:49,780 --> 00:27:51,780
I didn't – I want to be honest with you.

419
00:27:51,780 --> 00:27:53,780
I'm going to say it right here.

420
00:27:53,780 --> 00:27:55,780
Didn't think I'd like it.

421
00:27:55,780 --> 00:27:57,780
But then I made it, and you know what happened?

422
00:27:57,780 --> 00:27:58,780
Your belly filled with sunlight.

423
00:27:58,780 --> 00:27:59,780
You liked it.

424
00:27:59,780 --> 00:28:02,780
It was absolutely delicious, just like every other meal that Sun Basket sends to me.

425
00:28:02,780 --> 00:28:07,780
They challenged me to think outside of the box a little bit by thinking inside the box.

426
00:28:07,780 --> 00:28:12,780
Whenever every week I get a new box of Sun Basket ingredients, they sent a promo box,

427
00:28:12,780 --> 00:28:15,780
and you know what I did after I ate that promo box?

428
00:28:15,780 --> 00:28:16,780
What?

429
00:28:16,780 --> 00:28:17,780
I just kept getting it.

430
00:28:17,780 --> 00:28:20,780
I was paying for it out of pocket with my own money.

431
00:28:20,780 --> 00:28:22,780
That's how wild I am about Sun Basket.

432
00:28:22,780 --> 00:28:28,780
Delicious foods, really in-depth recipes.

433
00:28:28,780 --> 00:28:30,780
You know what I love also about them is you can switch out the proteins.

434
00:28:30,780 --> 00:28:31,780
Get out.

435
00:28:31,780 --> 00:28:35,780
So if, like, if you want ground chicken and you don't like – I think chicken thighs are gross.

436
00:28:35,780 --> 00:28:36,780
Don't at me.

437
00:28:36,780 --> 00:28:37,780
What?

438
00:28:37,780 --> 00:28:39,780
I switched – I said don't at me.

439
00:28:39,780 --> 00:28:40,780
That wasn't an ad, Justin.

440
00:28:40,780 --> 00:28:42,780
I'm talking to you in real life.

441
00:28:42,780 --> 00:28:45,780
Yeah, it's like a – it's like a – it's like a spoken ad.

442
00:28:45,780 --> 00:28:49,780
You want ground turkey, ground chicken, whatever you want.

443
00:28:49,780 --> 00:28:51,780
They'll sub in the proteins for you.

444
00:28:51,780 --> 00:28:54,780
You can even do, like, tofu or something like that if you want to go meatless.

445
00:28:54,780 --> 00:28:55,780
They got the options.

446
00:28:55,780 --> 00:28:59,780
Beyond the Meal kits, they got these fresh and ready meals, which I know, Griffin, you get into.

447
00:28:59,780 --> 00:29:06,780
Yeah, we're stocking up on those for some quick and easy and tasty dinners for once the baby gets here.

448
00:29:06,780 --> 00:29:07,780
Yeah.

449
00:29:07,780 --> 00:29:09,780

454
00:29:29,780 --> 00:29:36,780
So I've been doing some streaming recently, and I have noticed conclusively that if someone says, like, great shirt or asks about my shirt,

455
00:29:36,780 --> 00:29:40,780
it is 100% a Stitch Fix shirt that I got from Stitch Fix.

456
00:29:40,780 --> 00:29:47,780
Because ever since I joined Stitch Fix and became, you know, like, a Stitch Fix user, I guess I would say, my style game has improved exponentially.

457
00:29:47,780 --> 00:29:49,780
I think all of ours has.

458
00:29:49,780 --> 00:29:54,780
And I'm also wearing the most comfortable jeans I've ever had.

459
00:29:54,780 --> 00:29:56,780
Jeans you could sleep in.

460
00:29:56,780 --> 00:29:58,780
That's their new slogan.

461
00:29:58,780 --> 00:30:00,780
Stitch Fix jeans you could sleep in.

462
00:30:00,780 --> 00:30:05,780
They offer clothing hand selected by expert stylists for your unique style, size, and budget.

463
00:30:05,780 --> 00:30:09,780
You can try on pieces at home before you buy, keep your favorites, and send back the rest.

464
00:30:09,780 --> 00:30:14,780
Stitch Fix has free shipping, easy returns and exchanges, and a prepaid return envelope is included.

465
00:30:14,780 --> 00:30:16,780
There's no subscription required.

466
00:30:16,780 --> 00:30:19,780
Try Stitch Fix once or set up automatic deliveries.

467
00:30:19,780 --> 00:30:24,780

That's stitchfix.com slash my brother for 25% off when you keep everything in your fix.

471
00:30:37,780 --> 00:30:39,780
Stitchfix.com slash my brother.

472
00:30:39,780 --> 00:30:42,780
Jeans so comfortable you can sleep in them.

473
00:30:42,780 --> 00:30:45,780
I mean, they have shirts so comfortable you can sleep in them too, probably.

474
00:30:45,780 --> 00:30:47,780
Yeah, but that's not impressed.

475
00:30:47,780 --> 00:30:49,780
There are lots of shirts that I would sleep in, and most of them.

476
00:30:49,780 --> 00:30:53,780
You can sleep in anything if you really believe in yourself and you're willing to put yourself to the test.

477
00:30:53,780 --> 00:30:54,780
I mean, yes.

478
00:30:54,780 --> 00:30:57,780
Okay, you could sleep in anything, but these are jeans you want to sleep in.

479
00:30:57,780 --> 00:30:58,780
Is that better?

480
00:30:58,780 --> 00:31:00,780
One time Chris Angel slept in a sweater.

481
00:31:00,780 --> 00:31:01,780
Oh, boy.

482
00:31:01,780 --> 00:31:03,780
It's fucking wild, man.

483
00:31:03,780 --> 00:31:05,780
And it was hot outside too.

484
00:31:05,780 --> 00:31:07,780
It wasn't like a cold night.

485
00:31:10,780 --> 00:31:11,780
Hey, it's Jon Moe.

486
00:31:11,780 --> 00:31:15,780
And look, these are challenging times for our mental and emotional health.

487
00:31:15,780 --> 00:31:16,780
I get it.

488
00:31:16,780 --> 00:31:20,780
That's why I'm so excited for my new podcast, Depression Mode.

489
00:31:20,780 --> 00:31:28,780
We're tackling depression, anxiety, trauma, stress, the kinds of things that are just super common but don't get talked about nearly enough.

490
00:31:28,780 --> 00:31:36,780
Conversations that are illuminating, honest, and sometimes pretty funny with folks like Kelsey Darrah, Dope and Mike Eagle, and Patton Oswalt.

491
00:31:36,780 --> 00:31:38,780
Humphrey Bogart was never in therapy.

492
00:31:38,780 --> 00:31:43,780
And then my dad said, yeah, but he smoked a carton of cigarettes a day.

493
00:31:43,780 --> 00:31:45,780
So he was in therapy.

494
00:31:45,780 --> 00:31:48,780
Plus psychiatrists, psychologists, and all kinds of folks.

495
00:31:48,780 --> 00:31:52,780
On Depression Mode, we're working together, learning, helping each other out.

496
00:31:52,780 --> 00:31:53,780
We're a team.

497
00:31:53,780 --> 00:31:54,780
Join our team.

498
00:31:54,780 --> 00:31:58,780
Depression Mode for maximum fun wherever you get your podcasts.

499
00:32:02,780 --> 00:32:04,780
This is usually where the Munch Squad goes.

500
00:32:04,780 --> 00:32:06,780
Now we're all kind of floundering a bit.

501
00:32:06,780 --> 00:32:09,780
Do you want to read another question?

502
00:32:09,780 --> 00:32:11,780
Yeah, I'd like that.

503
00:32:11,780 --> 00:32:23,780
When I was 13, a lawnmower I was using caught fire and started a small, they've got this in quotes, wildfire, burning a little under an acre of land.

504
00:32:23,780 --> 00:32:27,780
Much to my embarrassment, this was then put on the news.

505
00:32:27,780 --> 00:32:31,780
And since it was a small town, everyone from my school knew it was me.

506
00:32:31,780 --> 00:32:32,780
I'm 23 now.

507
00:32:32,780 --> 00:32:38,780
But sometimes when I go back home, people still sometimes joke like, hey, started any fires lately?

508
00:32:38,780 --> 00:32:39,780
That's a pretty good line.

509
00:32:39,780 --> 00:32:40,780
Good line.

510
00:32:40,780 --> 00:32:45,780
What can I do to take the heat off my history with fire and maybe get known for something new?

511
00:32:45,780 --> 00:32:46,780
Any ideas are appreciated.

512
00:32:46,780 --> 00:32:48,780
That's from accidental arsonist.

513
00:32:48,780 --> 00:32:51,780
And they've got accidental in quotes too, which is strange.

514
00:32:51,780 --> 00:32:52,780
I don't understand.

515
00:32:52,780 --> 00:32:55,780
You're going to need to stop some fires, I think.

516
00:32:55,780 --> 00:32:56,780
Oh, that's good.

517
00:32:56,780 --> 00:32:57,780
Yeah?

518
00:32:57,780 --> 00:33:02,780
I feel like, well, I don't know how many fires you'd have to stop for it to balance out.

519
00:33:02,780 --> 00:33:04,780
Maybe five stopped fires?

520
00:33:04,780 --> 00:33:06,780
One acres worth of fire.

521
00:33:06,780 --> 00:33:07,780
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

522
00:33:07,780 --> 00:33:11,780
Depending on if you're in the city, that could be a whole bunch of fires.

523
00:33:11,780 --> 00:33:14,780
But we're not talking about firefighting.

524
00:33:14,780 --> 00:33:17,780
There will be no hoses, no extinguishers involved.

525
00:33:17,780 --> 00:33:23,780
I'm talking about like you see somebody smoking next to a cotton swab factory and you say, stop it.

526
00:33:23,780 --> 00:33:24,780
Stop it.

527
00:33:24,780 --> 00:33:25,780
Hey, no, no, no.

528
00:33:25,780 --> 00:33:26,780
Don't do that.

529
00:33:26,780 --> 00:33:30,780
Don't you see this pile of sawdust you are sitting on top of?

530
00:33:30,780 --> 00:33:32,780
This is a terrible place to set off fireworks.

531
00:33:32,780 --> 00:33:34,780
It's a bad place to have big smokes.

532
00:33:34,780 --> 00:33:35,780
That's a cigar.

533
00:33:35,780 --> 00:33:39,780
That's a big novelty size cigar like a wolf would smoke in a cartoon.

534
00:33:39,780 --> 00:33:41,780
You got such a big cigar.

535
00:33:41,780 --> 00:33:42,780
What?

536
00:33:42,780 --> 00:33:43,780
You're a baby.

537
00:33:43,780 --> 00:33:44,780
You're a baby.

538
00:33:44,780 --> 00:33:45,780
What are you doing with that cigar?

539
00:33:45,780 --> 00:33:48,780
How did you get into this sawdust pile, baby?

540
00:33:48,780 --> 00:33:51,780
Hey, hey, is this Tim here from the news?

541
00:33:51,780 --> 00:33:55,780
Listen, you better get out of here because I'm about to stop a baby from smoking a huge cigar.

542
00:33:55,780 --> 00:33:57,780
And I feel like that's really going to turn my rep around.

543
00:33:57,780 --> 00:34:03,780
And listen, this is going to sound like I staged it, but I promise I came upon this completely naturally.

544
00:34:03,780 --> 00:34:08,780
I did not give this baby a cigar, nor did I set it on top of this pile of sawdust.

545
00:34:08,780 --> 00:34:11,780
Fuck, there's a whole baby cigar party happening.

546
00:34:11,780 --> 00:34:13,780
There's like four more babies with cigars.

547
00:34:13,780 --> 00:34:14,780
Tim, get down here, man.

548
00:34:14,780 --> 00:34:16,780
You got to hurry.

549
00:34:16,780 --> 00:34:17,780
Get down here.

550
00:34:17,780 --> 00:34:18,780
Bring Rob Johnson.

551
00:34:18,780 --> 00:34:19,780
Bring the camera crew.

552
00:34:19,780 --> 00:34:20,780
Call Spencer Atkins.

553
00:34:20,780 --> 00:34:21,780
Get everybody down here.

554
00:34:21,780 --> 00:34:22,780
This is wild.

555
00:34:22,780 --> 00:34:23,780
Get Bill Murray.

556
00:34:23,780 --> 00:34:25,780
Get the whole team out here.

557
00:34:25,780 --> 00:34:26,780
No, not that Bill Murray.

558
00:34:26,780 --> 00:34:29,780
The Bill Murray that was a newscaster in the hometown where we grew up.

559
00:34:29,780 --> 00:34:31,780
The Bill Murray from WSAC.

560
00:34:31,780 --> 00:34:32,780
God.

561
00:34:32,780 --> 00:34:33,780
Come on.

562
00:34:33,780 --> 00:34:34,780
Oh, you're not coming?

563
00:34:34,780 --> 00:34:35,780
Okay.

564
00:34:35,780 --> 00:34:39,780
See, now you've got to start your own television news station or newspaper.

565
00:34:39,780 --> 00:34:46,780
Okay, this is Bob Stevenson with the Bob Stevenson Dispatch, and oh boy, I've done it again.

566
00:34:46,780 --> 00:34:50,780
Stopped another baby cigar fire at the sawdust factory.

567
00:34:50,780 --> 00:34:52,780
This paper is free.

568
00:34:52,780 --> 00:34:55,780
Please just read it and give it to everyone you know.

569
00:34:55,780 --> 00:34:57,780
Well, I mean, you could start a YouTube channel.

570
00:34:57,780 --> 00:34:58,780
Those are easy.

571
00:34:58,780 --> 00:35:02,780
Everybody's got a YouTube channel now, right, where you're just going around stopping baby fires.

572
00:35:02,780 --> 00:35:04,780
Thanks for subscribing to my newsletter.

573
00:35:04,780 --> 00:35:08,780
Didn't stop any fires this week, but watch this space.

574
00:35:08,780 --> 00:35:10,780
I'm out there.

575
00:35:10,780 --> 00:35:15,780
Email me at my tip line if you see anybody doing bad fire stuff.

576
00:35:15,780 --> 00:35:17,780
No difficult fires, though, please.

577
00:35:17,780 --> 00:35:20,780
I don't have any resources.

578
00:35:20,780 --> 00:35:26,780
Do you have a sort of, is this the sort of town where just having your own YouTube would make you like the YouTube guy?

579
00:35:26,780 --> 00:35:27,780
Oh, I don't mind that.

580
00:35:27,780 --> 00:35:28,780
Rather than the fire guy?

581
00:35:28,780 --> 00:35:29,780
Yeah.

582
00:35:29,780 --> 00:35:30,780
He's the one with the YouTube.

583
00:35:30,780 --> 00:35:32,780
Started any YouTube channels lately?

584
00:35:32,780 --> 00:35:33,780
I did, actually.

585
00:35:33,780 --> 00:35:34,780
Three more.

586
00:35:34,780 --> 00:35:35,780
Yeah.

587
00:35:35,780 --> 00:35:37,780
Where's my mukbang channel?

588
00:35:37,780 --> 00:35:40,780
Okay.

589
00:35:40,780 --> 00:35:44,780
If they didn't want people to be repulsed by mukbang, they should have called it something less repulsive.

590
00:35:44,780 --> 00:35:45,780
Period.

591
00:35:45,780 --> 00:35:46,780
Mouth sounds?

592
00:35:46,780 --> 00:35:47,780
End of sentence.

593
00:35:47,780 --> 00:35:48,780
Mouth sounds bad.

594
00:35:48,780 --> 00:35:49,780
Okay.

595
00:35:49,780 --> 00:35:52,780
The sound your mouth makes when you say mouth sounds is actually pretty bad.

596
00:35:52,780 --> 00:35:53,780
It's really rough.

597
00:35:53,780 --> 00:35:57,780
I mean, we had to go become big podcasters so we could just stop being Clint's kids.

598
00:35:57,780 --> 00:35:59,780
Oh, here come Clint's kids up to no good.

599
00:35:59,780 --> 00:36:01,780
Apple doesn't fall far from the tree, huh?

600
00:36:01,780 --> 00:36:03,780
Like, I'm my own guy, actually.

601
00:36:03,780 --> 00:36:06,780
Like, I do a bunch of stuff that has nothing to do with my dad.

602
00:36:06,780 --> 00:36:10,780
Yeah, I worked pretty hard to become the non-video game brother.

603
00:36:10,780 --> 00:36:12,780
But now I'm blowing it with this Twitch thing.

604
00:36:12,780 --> 00:36:14,780
Oh no, I just realized.

605
00:36:14,780 --> 00:36:17,780
Oh no, I'm going to become the video game brother.

606
00:36:17,780 --> 00:36:18,780
No, you're still the beard brother.

607
00:36:18,780 --> 00:36:19,780
Oh, thank you.

608
00:36:19,780 --> 00:36:20,780
That means a lot to me.

609
00:36:20,780 --> 00:36:21,780
You can hear the beard on the microphone.

610
00:36:21,780 --> 00:36:22,780
Thank you so much.

611
00:36:22,780 --> 00:36:23,780
It's scratchy and rough.

612
00:36:23,780 --> 00:36:24,780
Thank you.

613
00:36:24,780 --> 00:36:28,780
You could start other bigger fires and then maybe people would still learn to watch their fucking mouths.

614
00:36:28,780 --> 00:36:29,780
Or own it.

615
00:36:29,780 --> 00:36:30,780
And someone's like, did you start any fires lately?

616
00:36:30,780 --> 00:36:32,780
And they're like, I did.

617
00:36:32,780 --> 00:36:33,780
I did.

618
00:36:33,780 --> 00:36:34,780
It's your house.

619
00:36:34,780 --> 00:36:35,780
Go home.

620
00:36:35,780 --> 00:36:37,780
You better go check on your dad.

621
00:36:37,780 --> 00:36:39,780
Go check on your dad.

622
00:36:39,780 --> 00:36:40,780
Ah, yes.

623
00:36:40,780 --> 00:36:42,780
That's Fireboy's catchphrase, don't you know?

624
00:36:42,780 --> 00:36:44,780
Go check on your dad.

625
00:36:44,780 --> 00:36:49,780
Is it possible to say it was a controlled burn?

626
00:36:49,780 --> 00:36:52,780
And that they don't get it.

627
00:36:52,780 --> 00:36:54,780
I'm an amateur fire person.

628
00:36:54,780 --> 00:36:56,780
This is a controlled burn.

629
00:36:56,780 --> 00:36:59,780
I had it completely under control.

630
00:36:59,780 --> 00:37:02,780
Don't you see how I put quotes around wildfire?

631
00:37:02,780 --> 00:37:04,780
More like mild fire.

632
00:37:04,780 --> 00:37:08,780
That's just a little joke in the controlled fire industry.

633
00:37:08,780 --> 00:37:14,780
Now you're asking, is a broken lawnmower the typical device we use to start our controlled burns?

634
00:37:14,780 --> 00:37:17,780
And that just shows how ignorant you are.

635
00:37:17,780 --> 00:37:21,780
Have you read any books about starting controlled burns lately?

636
00:37:21,780 --> 00:37:22,780
What do you think?

637
00:37:22,780 --> 00:37:26,780
People just throw their broken lawnmowers in the garbage when they're done with them?

638
00:37:26,780 --> 00:37:27,780
No.

639
00:37:27,780 --> 00:37:28,780
What a waste.

640
00:37:28,780 --> 00:37:31,780
What a tremendous waste.

641
00:37:31,780 --> 00:37:37,780
Were there several small businesses located in this one acre that also burned down?

642
00:37:37,780 --> 00:37:40,780
Yeah, that's part of the control, dude.

643
00:37:40,780 --> 00:37:43,780
I had to burn them down to make room for new businesses.

644
00:37:43,780 --> 00:37:45,780
Those have sprinklers.

645
00:37:45,780 --> 00:37:47,780
It's easier to control it.

646
00:37:47,780 --> 00:37:50,780
Think about if it was just trees, you idiot.

647
00:37:50,780 --> 00:37:52,780
Those burn so quick.

648
00:37:52,780 --> 00:37:54,780
They had to get some insurance money.

649
00:37:54,780 --> 00:37:56,780
It's all part of the plan.

650
00:37:56,780 --> 00:37:58,780
It's all part of the plan.

651
00:37:58,780 --> 00:37:59,780
They were in on it.

652
00:37:59,780 --> 00:38:00,780
We were all in on it.

653
00:38:00,780 --> 00:38:07,780
And aren't you enjoying that new Mexican restaurant that they built on the burned up ground that I burned up?

654
00:38:07,780 --> 00:38:08,780
You're welcome.

655
00:38:08,780 --> 00:38:10,780
Enjoy your enchiladas.

656
00:38:10,780 --> 00:38:11,780
What about the-

657
00:38:11,780 --> 00:38:12,780
It's a natural part.

658
00:38:12,780 --> 00:38:15,780
What about the part of the wildlife preserve that burned down too?

659
00:38:15,780 --> 00:38:16,780
You're welcome.

660
00:38:16,780 --> 00:38:21,780
That one was an accident, but everybody's allowed to make a few accidents, huh?

661
00:38:21,780 --> 00:38:23,780
Yeah, I'm human.

662
00:38:23,780 --> 00:38:24,780
I'm a human being.

663
00:38:24,780 --> 00:38:25,780
I'm a human being.

664
00:38:25,780 --> 00:38:28,780
And those were very rare birds.

665
00:38:28,780 --> 00:38:35,780
Now they're more rare, and the people who have those birds have more money in their pockets, so they're not complaining, huh?

666
00:38:35,780 --> 00:38:38,780
Hey, what about the kinds of animals that eat ashes?

667
00:38:38,780 --> 00:38:39,780
Yep.

668
00:38:39,780 --> 00:38:43,780
They gotta get their bellies full too, right?

669
00:38:43,780 --> 00:38:44,780
Yes.

670
00:38:44,780 --> 00:38:47,780
And to be fair, I thought those birds were phoenixes.

671
00:38:47,780 --> 00:38:51,780
And if that had been the case, this all would have been totally cool, wouldn't it?

672
00:38:51,780 --> 00:38:54,780
So I guess you're the jerk now, Steven.

673
00:38:54,780 --> 00:38:56,780
What if you lost your keys?

674
00:38:56,780 --> 00:38:58,780
They're easier to find now.

675
00:38:58,780 --> 00:38:59,780
Yes.

676
00:38:59,780 --> 00:39:04,780
And I know that your car was also parked in there, and so that is kind of a moot point, and I understand that.

677
00:39:04,780 --> 00:39:05,780
I am sorry.

678
00:39:05,780 --> 00:39:07,780
But that's part of the control.

679
00:39:07,780 --> 00:39:08,780
Griffin, do you have any-

680
00:39:08,780 --> 00:39:09,780
I do, I do.

681
00:39:09,780 --> 00:39:12,780
This one was also sent in by Graham Roebuck, thank you.

682
00:39:12,780 --> 00:39:15,780
It's Yahoo Answers user Sorry, who asks,

683
00:39:15,780 --> 00:39:18,780
How can a font be sexy?

684
00:39:18,780 --> 00:39:24,780
On multiple font websites, I have seen sexy as a category, but they aren't just letters?

685
00:39:24,780 --> 00:39:25,780
What is happening?

686
00:39:25,780 --> 00:39:26,780
Oh, come on.

687
00:39:26,780 --> 00:39:27,780
Stop being willfully obtuse.

688
00:39:27,780 --> 00:39:28,780
You know the answer to this.

689
00:39:28,780 --> 00:39:34,780
If you saw, let's see, if you got a love letter in papyrus, right?

690
00:39:34,780 --> 00:39:37,780
You would be like, oh, okay, whatever, right?

691
00:39:37,780 --> 00:39:41,780
Did this love letter get sent through time from ancient Egypt or some shit?

692
00:39:41,780 --> 00:39:42,780
Right, right, right.

693
00:39:42,780 --> 00:39:47,780
And I'm just pulling this off the top of my head, and I'm not looking, but sans serif sounds sexy?

694
00:39:47,780 --> 00:39:49,780
Yeah, sans serif is probably, it's up there.

695
00:39:49,780 --> 00:39:56,780
I think that that was the one that they sort of, they had sexiness in mind when they were developing this font.

696
00:39:56,780 --> 00:39:57,780
That's not very good.

697
00:39:57,780 --> 00:40:01,780
I'm just going to type in sexy font and then look away.

698
00:40:01,780 --> 00:40:03,780
Travis, type sexy font and then just go for it.

699
00:40:03,780 --> 00:40:04,780
Okay, I'm going to type sexy font.

700
00:40:04,780 --> 00:40:07,780
Helvetica.

701
00:40:07,780 --> 00:40:09,780
Helvetica sound, I would love to kiss Helvetica.

702
00:40:09,780 --> 00:40:11,780
Cassandra.

703
00:40:11,780 --> 00:40:12,780
Hello, Cassandra.

704
00:40:12,780 --> 00:40:14,780
That's kind of sexy, yeah.

705
00:40:14,780 --> 00:40:32,780
I love in all of these promotions where they're showing what the font looks like, even in the sexy font, it's like, the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.

706
00:40:32,780 --> 00:40:33,780
Oh, that would be a sexy font.

707
00:40:33,780 --> 00:40:39,780
If anyone's looking to design a sexy font, make it so anytime you put a single X, it's immediately three Xs.

708
00:40:39,780 --> 00:40:41,780
That's really good.

709
00:40:41,780 --> 00:40:43,780
You can only type three Xs at a time.

710
00:40:43,780 --> 00:40:46,780
Yeah, and while we're at it, just every M becomes three Ms.

711
00:40:46,780 --> 00:40:47,780
Yeah.

712
00:40:47,780 --> 00:40:49,780
That's something.

713
00:40:49,780 --> 00:40:53,780
The quick brown fox jump.

714
00:40:53,780 --> 00:40:56,780
And then there's a period.

715
00:40:56,780 --> 00:40:57,780
The sentence ends.

716
00:40:57,780 --> 00:41:06,780
That's a cool font when it actually changes the syntax of the sentence itself.

717
00:41:06,780 --> 00:41:11,780
So on this typography website, they got reviews for the different fonts.

718
00:41:11,780 --> 00:41:15,780
And they have this to say about Archer.

719
00:41:15,780 --> 00:41:19,780
Sweet but not saccharine, earnest but not grave.

720
00:41:19,780 --> 00:41:25,780
Archer is designed to hit just the right notes of forthrightness, credibility, and charm.

721
00:41:25,780 --> 00:41:27,780
Ooh, I like that.

722
00:41:27,780 --> 00:41:28,780
It's nice, right?

723
00:41:28,780 --> 00:41:29,780
It makes you feel like, hmm, maybe.

724
00:41:29,780 --> 00:41:35,780
Now I have here, I found one that's just called Luxurious Sexy, which, yeah.

725
00:41:35,780 --> 00:41:37,780
I bet you could find a font called E.

726
00:41:37,780 --> 00:41:40,780
I bet you could find a font called like...

727
00:41:40,780 --> 00:41:41,780
I'm going to look for Star Wars.

728
00:41:41,780 --> 00:41:44,780
Well, yeah, sure.

729
00:41:44,780 --> 00:41:47,780
That's not what I was going to say, but all right.

730
00:41:47,780 --> 00:41:50,780
Yeah, if you like Star Wars, I bet there's even a Star Trek one, too.

731
00:41:50,780 --> 00:41:51,780
Either one.

732
00:41:51,780 --> 00:41:52,780
Remember which one you like.

733
00:41:52,780 --> 00:41:53,780
I like Travis.

734
00:41:53,780 --> 00:41:54,780
I bet there's a font for you.

735
00:41:54,780 --> 00:41:55,780
I like the Travis font.

736
00:41:55,780 --> 00:41:58,780
There's a Travis font.

737
00:41:58,780 --> 00:42:04,780
Guys, what could be better fodder for a comedy audio podcast?

738
00:42:04,780 --> 00:42:06,780
Talking about what letters look like?

739
00:42:06,780 --> 00:42:07,780
Yeah, it's probably...

740
00:42:07,780 --> 00:42:08,780
Yeah, talking about letters.

741
00:42:08,780 --> 00:42:09,780
It's good.

742
00:42:09,780 --> 00:42:16,780
I hope the quarantine goes on forever.

743
00:42:16,780 --> 00:42:22,780
Just me talking here, but I love having all my meals come to me in metal boxes.

744
00:42:22,780 --> 00:42:27,780
Hooray.

745
00:42:27,780 --> 00:42:28,780
Okay.

746
00:42:28,780 --> 00:42:33,780
Lynn texted me to tell me there's going to be a Peeps Pepsi mashup.

747
00:42:33,780 --> 00:42:36,780
Peeps and Pepsi are joining forces to create marshmallow soda.

748
00:42:36,780 --> 00:42:37,780
That's gross.

749
00:42:37,780 --> 00:42:38,780
Okay.

750
00:42:38,780 --> 00:42:39,780
It's gross, right?

751
00:42:39,780 --> 00:42:41,780
I'd rather have Cola Peeps, please.

752
00:42:41,780 --> 00:42:42,780
It's marshmallow cola.

753
00:42:42,780 --> 00:42:46,780
It comes in a three pack of little seven and a half ounce cans.

754
00:42:46,780 --> 00:42:57,780
Now, you can't buy them at the fucking store, but you can tweet the hashtag hanginwithmypeeps

755
00:42:57,780 --> 00:43:00,780
and you can enter to win the sweepstakes.

756
00:43:00,780 --> 00:43:06,780
And you're supposed to show yourself enjoying your favorite springtime activities, quote,

757
00:43:06,780 --> 00:43:09,780
in a safe, socially distant manner.

758
00:43:09,780 --> 00:43:12,780
Incentivizing in the Krispy Kreme way.

759
00:43:12,780 --> 00:43:14,780
Safe, COVID-safe behaviors.

760
00:43:14,780 --> 00:43:15,780
Right, safety.

761
00:43:15,780 --> 00:43:17,780
Now, let's get a little deeper here.

762
00:43:17,780 --> 00:43:24,780
Todd Kaplan, the Pepsi's veep of marketing says, after what has been a very difficult year,

763
00:43:24,780 --> 00:43:28,780
many consumers are looking for new things to smile about.

764
00:43:28,780 --> 00:43:30,780
So we made very sweet pepsi.

765
00:43:30,780 --> 00:43:31,780
Can I...

766
00:43:31,780 --> 00:43:32,780
Just for them.

767
00:43:32,780 --> 00:43:36,780
So just because I want to just put a pin in it real quick,

768
00:43:36,780 --> 00:43:43,780
I just want to point out that I think in the QSR and food update kind of Munch Squad world,

769
00:43:43,780 --> 00:43:46,780
the new thing isn't going to be, this has been a difficult year.

770
00:43:46,780 --> 00:43:49,780
It's going to be after a difficult year.

771
00:43:49,780 --> 00:43:53,780
And it will be all about like, now that we've turned the corner, after a difficult year,

772
00:43:53,780 --> 00:43:58,780
things just need to, it's going to be that over and over and over again in some form.

773
00:43:58,780 --> 00:44:00,780
Yeah.

774
00:44:00,780 --> 00:44:02,780
I'm not very good at business, ask anybody.

775
00:44:02,780 --> 00:44:08,780
But how come these like businesses keep announcing these things and then saying,

776
00:44:08,780 --> 00:44:11,780
but you can't buy them, you have to like win them.

777
00:44:11,780 --> 00:44:16,780
Because it's just to get you, it's the new, and I guess Munch Squad is part of it.

778
00:44:16,780 --> 00:44:18,780
You know, like Munch Squad is to blame.

779
00:44:18,780 --> 00:44:21,780
But it's like, you don't actually have to do the thing.

780
00:44:21,780 --> 00:44:25,780
If you just say you're going to do the thing and then make people tweet about it,

781
00:44:25,780 --> 00:44:30,780
then you get all the attention without actually having to like make a bajillion of them

782
00:44:30,780 --> 00:44:32,780
and get logistics going and shit like that.

783
00:44:32,780 --> 00:44:33,780
It's infuriating.

784
00:44:33,780 --> 00:44:36,780
Don't tell me that you're going to make ketchup that looks like some dude's arm

785
00:44:36,780 --> 00:44:39,780
and then it's like, you have to send it in a self-addressed stamped envelope

786
00:44:39,780 --> 00:44:41,780
with fucking Bitcoins inside of it.

787
00:44:41,780 --> 00:44:43,780
Like sell that shit in stores.

788
00:44:43,780 --> 00:44:44,780
Fucking stop it.

789
00:44:44,780 --> 00:44:46,780
Stop making me jump through hoops.

790
00:44:46,780 --> 00:44:50,780
Be brave and trash your brand by making this gross soda

791
00:44:50,780 --> 00:44:53,780
and make some poor person accidentally buy it

792
00:44:53,780 --> 00:44:57,780
and then come home and be like, this soda fucking sucks.

793
00:44:57,780 --> 00:45:02,780
Have somebody accidentally buy your shitty marshmallow soda, cowards.

794
00:45:02,780 --> 00:45:05,780
We let Ed Sheeran make ketchup for us.

795
00:45:05,780 --> 00:45:06,780
Then fucking do it.

796
00:45:06,780 --> 00:45:11,780
Give him tomatoes and spices and sugar and let Ed Sheeran make the ketchup.

797
00:45:11,780 --> 00:45:14,780
And you have to mass produce whatever he makes.

798
00:45:14,780 --> 00:45:15,780
Yes, a million of them.

799
00:45:15,780 --> 00:45:20,780
Send him a million tomatoes and say, ball's in your court, Ed.

800
00:45:20,780 --> 00:45:22,780
Oh man, did you try some of this new ketchup?

801
00:45:22,780 --> 00:45:24,780
It tastes like shitty tomato water.

802
00:45:24,780 --> 00:45:27,780
Yeah, that's because Ed Sheeran squished it with his own feet

803
00:45:27,780 --> 00:45:30,780
and then we had to sell it at Kroger's.

804
00:45:30,780 --> 00:45:33,780
Because that was the deal we made with Ed Sheeran.

805
00:45:37,780 --> 00:45:41,780
Will you make Ed Sheeran ketchup if you promise to sell it for 100 years?

806
00:45:41,780 --> 00:45:43,780
Ooh, okay.

807
00:45:43,780 --> 00:45:46,780
I want it to replace real ketchup.

808
00:45:46,780 --> 00:45:48,780
Ooh, Ed Sheeran, you drive a hard bargain.

809
00:45:48,780 --> 00:45:49,780
Okay, yep, okay.

810
00:45:49,780 --> 00:45:51,780
This will be Heinz 58.

811
00:45:51,780 --> 00:45:53,780
We're throwing out the last one.

812
00:45:53,780 --> 00:45:54,780
This is the new one.

813
00:45:54,780 --> 00:45:57,780
We're not even going to name you on the bottle.

814
00:45:57,780 --> 00:46:00,780
We're just going to call this new ketchup

815
00:46:00,780 --> 00:46:02,780
and you just happen to be the person who made it.

816
00:46:02,780 --> 00:46:03,780
Sounds good to me.

817
00:46:03,780 --> 00:46:04,780
I'm Ed Sheeran.

818
00:46:04,780 --> 00:46:08,780
I dipped my french fries in Ed Sheeran's ketchup juice and it was disgusting.

819
00:46:08,780 --> 00:46:13,780
Well, that's because we're just going to have to find a new way to enjoy ketchup now.

820
00:46:13,780 --> 00:46:15,780
Because ketchup means something else.

821
00:46:15,780 --> 00:46:17,780
Pepsi means something else now.

822
00:46:17,780 --> 00:46:21,780
It's not a refreshing brown beverage that you enjoy with a pizza.

823
00:46:21,780 --> 00:46:25,780
Now it's a different thing that you have to use a different way.

824
00:46:25,780 --> 00:46:27,780
Now it's a joke that we all have to live with.

825
00:46:27,780 --> 00:46:31,780
We actually fucked up so bad because of the new law that Biden put in

826
00:46:31,780 --> 00:46:34,780
where you have to really do the things you say you're going to.

827
00:46:34,780 --> 00:46:35,780
There's no Pepsi anymore.

828
00:46:35,780 --> 00:46:37,780
It's just an Instagram filter.

829
00:46:37,780 --> 00:46:38,780
You can't drink it.

830
00:46:38,780 --> 00:46:39,780
It's a filter on Instagram.

831
00:46:39,780 --> 00:46:40,780
And we fucked up.

832
00:46:40,780 --> 00:46:41,780
Don't get it twisted.

833
00:46:41,780 --> 00:46:42,780
We fucked up.

834
00:46:42,780 --> 00:46:45,780
It was a bad idea that we did but we said we'd do it

835
00:46:45,780 --> 00:46:47,780
and this is it.

836
00:46:47,780 --> 00:46:49,780
Anyways, are you hiring?

837
00:46:49,780 --> 00:46:51,780
Oh boy.

838
00:46:51,780 --> 00:46:52,780
Oh boy.

839
00:46:52,780 --> 00:46:54,780
Um, was this a yacht?

840
00:46:54,780 --> 00:46:56,780
What was this?

841
00:46:56,780 --> 00:46:58,780
Here's a new question.

842
00:46:58,780 --> 00:47:01,780
Last Halloween, my wife and I never got around to carving the pumpkin

843
00:47:01,780 --> 00:47:02,780
our best friend brought us.

844
00:47:02,780 --> 00:47:05,780
Instead of tossing it, our friend hid it in our bathtub as a joke

845
00:47:05,780 --> 00:47:07,780
slash gentle reminder to carve it.

846
00:47:07,780 --> 00:47:10,780
Unfortunately, my wife and I proceeded to keep it in the tub

847
00:47:10,780 --> 00:47:14,780
while using the tub as usual for the next four months?

848
00:47:14,780 --> 00:47:17,780
It was surprisingly useful for many tub related act...

849
00:47:17,780 --> 00:47:19,780
Is this where we're at?

850
00:47:19,780 --> 00:47:21,780
What does that mean?

851
00:47:21,780 --> 00:47:25,780
It was surprisingly useful for many tub related activities.

852
00:47:25,780 --> 00:47:29,780
What do you do in the tub?

853
00:47:29,780 --> 00:47:32,780
Flash forward to yesterday and the pumpkin.

854
00:47:32,780 --> 00:47:33,780
You guys are never going to believe this.

855
00:47:33,780 --> 00:47:36,780
Well, it's rotted in the dang tub, hasn't it?

856
00:47:36,780 --> 00:47:37,780
I cleaned it all up.

857
00:47:37,780 --> 00:47:40,780
But in the process, a not insignificant amount of pumpkin seeds

858
00:47:40,780 --> 00:47:44,780
and guts went down the already poorly functioning drain.

859
00:47:44,780 --> 00:47:46,780
If this causes a plumbing issue,

860
00:47:46,780 --> 00:47:49,780
how do we explain it to the landlord without him telling him

861
00:47:49,780 --> 00:47:52,780
we kept a pumpkin in the tub for four months?

862
00:47:52,780 --> 00:47:55,780
This is a large clawfoot tub with a shower head hookup.

863
00:47:55,780 --> 00:47:57,780
If that reference is needed, it wasn't.

864
00:47:57,780 --> 00:48:00,780
That's from punk and pumpkin.

865
00:48:00,780 --> 00:48:03,780
It's from a person who needs some help

866
00:48:03,780 --> 00:48:07,780
and a help on a scale that may be grander than we can offer.

867
00:48:07,780 --> 00:48:10,780
I think the best course of events...

868
00:48:10,780 --> 00:48:11,780
Really?

869
00:48:11,780 --> 00:48:13,780
Yeah, I really think.

870
00:48:13,780 --> 00:48:15,780
You have to remember, I do these questions, right?

871
00:48:15,780 --> 00:48:18,780
So I saw this hours ago.

872
00:48:18,780 --> 00:48:20,780
I've had time to process it, boys.

873
00:48:20,780 --> 00:48:25,780
And the thing is, I think you are going to get the most leeway

874
00:48:25,780 --> 00:48:29,780
by just telling the landlord what you did.

875
00:48:29,780 --> 00:48:33,780
We left a pumpkin in the tub for four months while tubbing around it

876
00:48:33,780 --> 00:48:35,780
and some things went bad.

877
00:48:35,780 --> 00:48:39,780
Doing the usual tub stuff that we found the pumpkin to be

878
00:48:39,780 --> 00:48:41,780
surprisingly complimentary to.

879
00:48:41,780 --> 00:48:45,780
We were in there thumping around, and it rotted away.

880
00:48:45,780 --> 00:48:47,780
It got in the ding-ding drain, didn't it?

881
00:48:47,780 --> 00:48:50,780
This one's on us, and if you want to add an extra $20 to our rent

882
00:48:50,780 --> 00:48:52,780
for the next couple of months, we totally understand.

883
00:48:52,780 --> 00:48:53,780
We totally get it.

884
00:48:53,780 --> 00:48:56,780
For a pumpkin surcharge, the usual.

885
00:48:56,780 --> 00:48:59,780
The usual pumpkin mistake surcharge, please.

886
00:48:59,780 --> 00:49:02,780
What's your usual... Excuse me, is this landlord?

887
00:49:02,780 --> 00:49:04,780
What's your usual rate for making a pumpkin mistake?

888
00:49:04,780 --> 00:49:06,780
Hypothetically speaking.

889
00:49:06,780 --> 00:49:09,780
And is that kind of something that I can purchase prophylactically?

890
00:49:09,780 --> 00:49:14,780
I notice here that there is in the lease a listing for pet addendum.

891
00:49:14,780 --> 00:49:15,780
So I understand that.

892
00:49:15,780 --> 00:49:17,780
My pet's a pumpkin that lives in my tub.

893
00:49:17,780 --> 00:49:19,780
And he had an accident.

894
00:49:19,780 --> 00:49:21,780
He had an accident of dying.

895
00:49:21,780 --> 00:49:23,780
And so we need an emergency here.

896
00:49:23,780 --> 00:49:25,780
Excuse me, is this landlord?

897
00:49:25,780 --> 00:49:28,780
There is an emergency here, and it is of a pumpkin variety,

898
00:49:28,780 --> 00:49:30,780
and this is covered in my lease, I bet.

899
00:49:30,780 --> 00:49:31,780
So what was the damage...

900
00:49:31,780 --> 00:49:35,780
And if it's not specifically in the lease, that's a relief for me, honestly.

901
00:49:35,780 --> 00:49:39,780
Can you forward me the list of things we are allowed to get stuck in the tub

902
00:49:39,780 --> 00:49:40,780
drain, please?

903
00:49:40,780 --> 00:49:41,780
And is pumpkins one of them?

904
00:49:41,780 --> 00:49:42,780
You could just tell me that.

905
00:49:42,780 --> 00:49:46,780
What are some things that you allow in tub?

906
00:49:46,780 --> 00:49:48,780
Oh, you don't have a comprehensive list.

907
00:49:48,780 --> 00:49:52,780
Hmm, seems like a lack of forethought on your part.

908
00:49:52,780 --> 00:49:56,780
Do you recall... Excuse me, this is Dilip in the apartment you have.

909
00:49:56,780 --> 00:50:01,780
Do you remember a green mutually beneficial list of things that can go in tub?

910
00:50:01,780 --> 00:50:02,780
You remember.

911
00:50:02,780 --> 00:50:04,780
Okay, we'll clarify.

912
00:50:04,780 --> 00:50:07,780
Is there a limit to how long I was allowed to keep pumpkin in tub?

913
00:50:07,780 --> 00:50:12,780
Because I will tell you for future reference, four months is too long.

914
00:50:12,780 --> 00:50:19,780
To be fair, sir, before you get all high and mighty about it, to be fair,

915
00:50:19,780 --> 00:50:23,780
if you noticed that pumpkin had not been removed from my home by December,

916
00:50:23,780 --> 00:50:26,780
that would have been the moment for you to speak up as my landlord

917
00:50:26,780 --> 00:50:28,780
if you were really paying attention to the problem.

918
00:50:28,780 --> 00:50:31,780
And to be fair, you take a tub in my apartment every week,

919
00:50:31,780 --> 00:50:34,780
so you must have noticed, right?

920
00:50:34,780 --> 00:50:37,780
I'm sorry, I want to engage here.

921
00:50:37,780 --> 00:50:46,780
I want to have fun, but once I used a foot bath in Japan that had yuzu fruit

922
00:50:46,780 --> 00:50:50,780
floating in it and it made the water smell, and oranges, and it made the water

923
00:50:50,780 --> 00:50:55,780
smell pretty good that I had my feet in, and it was revitalizing.

924
00:50:55,780 --> 00:51:03,780
This pumpkin, I cannot imagine, served a similar purpose and also was something

925
00:51:03,780 --> 00:51:09,780
you had to bathe around while it's so big a pumpkin is.

926
00:51:09,780 --> 00:51:11,780
I understand your confusion, Griffin.

927
00:51:11,780 --> 00:51:15,780
It's a large clawfoot tub with a showerhead hookup.

928
00:51:15,780 --> 00:51:18,780
So I think that that kind of clears it up.

929
00:51:18,780 --> 00:51:19,780
Yeah, that actually makes a lot of sense.

930
00:51:19,780 --> 00:51:25,780
So you were showering in there and just you had pumpkin on the foot?

931
00:51:25,780 --> 00:51:26,780
And it has claw feet.

932
00:51:26,780 --> 00:51:28,780
And the tub has claw feet.

933
00:51:28,780 --> 00:51:30,780
Okay.

934
00:51:30,780 --> 00:51:32,780
Oh, with the claw feet.

935
00:51:32,780 --> 00:51:37,780
Yeah, because of the claw feet, sometimes the pumpkin's just going to get lost in there.

936
00:51:37,780 --> 00:51:42,780
So I guess let's just take turns apologizing, because we fucked up.

937
00:51:42,780 --> 00:51:44,780
We didn't realize the tub had claw feet.

938
00:51:44,780 --> 00:51:45,780
I thought it was a built-in.

939
00:51:45,780 --> 00:51:46,780
I'm sorry.

940
00:51:46,780 --> 00:51:49,780
It's not a built-in, it's a standalone deal with a showerhead hookup.

941
00:51:49,780 --> 00:51:50,780
I'm sorry.

942
00:51:50,780 --> 00:51:51,780
Oh, man.

943
00:51:51,780 --> 00:51:52,780
Oh, now.

944
00:51:52,780 --> 00:51:54,780
Now who left a pumpkin in the tub?

945
00:51:54,780 --> 00:51:58,780
Still you, actually.

946
00:51:58,780 --> 00:52:00,780
We don't know how big a pumpkin.

947
00:52:00,780 --> 00:52:06,780
It could have been one of those small, paint a funny face on it and put it on the table

948
00:52:06,780 --> 00:52:07,780
by the door.

949
00:52:07,780 --> 00:52:08,780
No, it's big.

950
00:52:08,780 --> 00:52:09,780
It's a big pumpkin.

951
00:52:09,780 --> 00:52:10,780
It's big.

952
00:52:10,780 --> 00:52:12,780
You don't send a question like this to us if it's not a full-size pumpkin.

953
00:52:12,780 --> 00:52:15,780
Yeah, it would have headed over to ask John and Hank.

954
00:52:15,780 --> 00:52:16,780
You know what I mean?

955
00:52:16,780 --> 00:52:17,780
They handle the tiny pumpkin stuff.

956
00:52:17,780 --> 00:52:18,780
They handle that.

957
00:52:18,780 --> 00:52:21,780
Yeah, hey, I think it's dear Hank and John, but a great try.

958
00:52:21,780 --> 00:52:23,780
No, they started a second show.

959
00:52:23,780 --> 00:52:24,780
Sure.

960
00:52:24,780 --> 00:52:26,780
Hey, let's talk about this for a second.

961
00:52:26,780 --> 00:52:29,780
I'm going to keep drilling down on parts of this until it seems less insane.

962
00:52:29,780 --> 00:52:32,780
Flash forward to yesterday and the pumpkin is rotten in the tub.

963
00:52:32,780 --> 00:52:35,780
Let me hold up for just one second.

964
00:52:35,780 --> 00:52:38,780
You don't get to flash forward to the pumpkin is rotten in the tub.

965
00:52:38,780 --> 00:52:41,780
You go in the tub every single day.

966
00:52:41,780 --> 00:52:47,780
You did not come in one day and like, holy shit, look what happened to our pristine pumpkin.

967
00:52:47,780 --> 00:52:48,780
Yeah.

968
00:52:48,780 --> 00:52:50,780
No, that's not how it shook out.

969
00:52:50,780 --> 00:52:56,780
A swarm of locusts did not fly in through the window and fuck your pumpkin up over like a two-hour period.

970
00:52:56,780 --> 00:52:58,780
And question asker.

971
00:52:58,780 --> 00:53:03,780
You didn't lift it up for one of your regular bathtub activities and the bottom just fell out.

972
00:53:03,780 --> 00:53:05,780
Were you using it as a loofah?

973
00:53:05,780 --> 00:53:06,780
You can tell me.

974
00:53:06,780 --> 00:53:07,780
I'm not going to be angry.

975
00:53:07,780 --> 00:53:08,780
I'll be a little angry.

976
00:53:08,780 --> 00:53:12,780
You would certainly notice at what point in the decompositional process it was-

977
00:53:12,780 --> 00:53:13,780
Yeah.

978
00:53:13,780 --> 00:53:17,780
Any sponginess whatsoever should have been sign one that this pumpkin was-

979
00:53:17,780 --> 00:53:22,780
Four months is a tremendous amount of time for a pumpkin to be extant.

980
00:53:22,780 --> 00:53:23,780
Huge.

981
00:53:23,780 --> 00:53:32,780
Not to continue the scrutiny here, question asker, but in the cleaning process, a not insignificant amount of pumpkin seeds and guts went down the already poorly functioning drain.

982
00:53:32,780 --> 00:53:35,780
How loosey goosey was your cleaning process?

983
00:53:35,780 --> 00:53:36,780
Yeah.

984
00:53:36,780 --> 00:53:39,780
It was getting pushed into the drain and you just thought, well, cost of doing business.

985
00:53:39,780 --> 00:53:40,780
Yeah.

986
00:53:40,780 --> 00:53:44,780
That's the number one area you got to defend if you are cleaning.

987
00:53:44,780 --> 00:53:51,780
I leave a pumpkin out in front of the house for three days past Halloween and it is deflated.

988
00:53:51,780 --> 00:53:54,780
It is a deflated pumpkin sitting out there.

989
00:53:54,780 --> 00:53:59,780
There is no way, no way it made it four months in a tub.

990
00:53:59,780 --> 00:54:00,780
Absolutely not.

991
00:54:00,780 --> 00:54:12,780
Maybe you've hit on a new pumpkin preservation technique whereby getting some fruit-tastic shampoo on it or whatever, you're going to keep it alive a little bit longer.

992
00:54:12,780 --> 00:54:14,780
We should all be submerging our pumpkins.

993
00:54:14,780 --> 00:54:18,780
So if you want to preserve your pumpkins, you can only find them usually that one time of year.

994
00:54:18,780 --> 00:54:23,780
So it's nice to have a pumpkin on hand for spring to really welcome the Easter Bunny in a way that's going to fuck them up.

995
00:54:23,780 --> 00:54:24,780
Yep.

996
00:54:24,780 --> 00:54:25,780
Right.

997
00:54:25,780 --> 00:54:27,780
You really want to confuse that cat.

998
00:54:27,780 --> 00:54:30,780
Hey, listen, thanks so much for listening to our podcast.

999
00:54:30,780 --> 00:54:31,780
We hope you've enjoyed yourself.

1000
00:54:31,780 --> 00:54:35,780
I guess this is the last one before we head into a bit of a hiatus.

1001
00:54:35,780 --> 00:54:39,780
Yes, it will be strange for a while.

1002
00:54:39,780 --> 00:54:40,780
Yeah.

1003
00:54:40,780 --> 00:54:42,780
We got some other fun, weird stuff for you though.

1004
00:54:42,780 --> 00:54:44,780
And things are turning around.

1005
00:54:44,780 --> 00:54:52,780
They're turning around here on Earth and I think brighter days are ahead, if that is any consolation to you.

1006
00:54:52,780 --> 00:54:54,780
That's where I'm at right now.

1007
00:54:54,780 --> 00:54:55,780
Okay.

1008
00:54:55,780 --> 00:54:56,780
Yeah.

1009
00:54:56,780 --> 00:54:57,780
Here's hoping.

1010
00:54:57,780 --> 00:55:01,780
Thank you to you for joining us once again.

1011
00:55:01,780 --> 00:55:04,780
And we want to tell you, we got a lot of cool merch over in the merch store.

1012
00:55:04,780 --> 00:55:08,780
We're running out of time for that March merch pin of the month.

1013
00:55:08,780 --> 00:55:11,780
It's sausage to me, which benefits feeding Texas.

1014
00:55:11,780 --> 00:55:13,780
You can also check out the empty bowl pin.

1015
00:55:13,780 --> 00:55:14,780
That one is evergreen.

1016
00:55:14,780 --> 00:55:19,780
So that is not a monthly pin as well as the 20 big dog run pin is going to be there.

1017
00:55:19,780 --> 00:55:22,780
Go pre-order the Adventure Zone Crystal Kingdom graphic novel.

1018
00:55:22,780 --> 00:55:25,780
You can pre-order that at theadventurezonecomic.com.

1019
00:55:25,780 --> 00:55:27,780
It comes out July 13th.

1020
00:55:27,780 --> 00:55:34,780
I've been doing a Twitch channel for a while now, twitch.tv slash the Travis McRoy.

1021
00:55:34,780 --> 00:55:36,780
Don't forget to check out our YouTube channel.

1022
00:55:36,780 --> 00:55:39,780
If you haven't done that in a while, just search McRoy family and you'll find it.

1023
00:55:39,780 --> 00:55:45,780
Thank you to Montane for creating our wonderful new theme music, which we love very much.

1024
00:55:45,780 --> 00:55:46,780
Yes.

1025
00:55:46,780 --> 00:55:48,780
It's called My Life is Better with You.

1026
00:55:48,780 --> 00:55:54,780
And go check out all of Montane's music and make sure that you support her during Eurovision.

1027
00:55:54,780 --> 00:55:57,780
Is there like a phone vote system?

1028
00:55:57,780 --> 00:56:00,780
Not, I don't think us Americans can get in on it.

1029
00:56:00,780 --> 00:56:02,780
Damn it.

1030
00:56:02,780 --> 00:56:04,780
Just another thing we're kept out of.

1031
00:56:04,780 --> 00:56:05,780
Right.

1032
00:56:05,780 --> 00:56:07,780
Hey, do y'all want a final Yahoo?

1033
00:56:07,780 --> 00:56:08,780
Please.

1034
00:56:08,780 --> 00:56:11,780
Okay, this final Yahoo was sent in by Merritt Palmer.

1035
00:56:11,780 --> 00:56:12,780
It's a very good one.

1036
00:56:12,780 --> 00:56:13,780
Thank you, Merritt.

1037
00:56:13,780 --> 00:56:14,780
It's an anonymous.

1038
00:56:14,780 --> 00:56:15,780
Oh no, it's John.

1039
00:56:15,780 --> 00:56:19,780
The Yahoo Answers user John asks,

1040
00:56:19,780 --> 00:56:25,780
why is the company called Johnson and Johnson and not the two Johnsons?

1041
00:56:29,780 --> 00:56:30,780
My name is Justin McElroy.

1042
00:56:30,780 --> 00:56:31,780
I'm Travis McElroy.

1043
00:56:31,780 --> 00:56:33,780
I'm Griffin McElroy.

1044
00:56:33,780 --> 00:56:34,780
This has been my brother, my brother.

1045
00:56:34,780 --> 00:56:53,780
May kiss your dad, square on the lips.

1046
00:57:04,780 --> 00:57:07,780
My life is better with you.
