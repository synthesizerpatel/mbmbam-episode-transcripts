1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:30,800
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:50,160
Live from the spot, rough and raw, at our daddy's house. We're at our daddy's house.

6
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:54,720
Let me check the date. I just opened up the calendar. It's pasta party 2011.

7
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:58,800
Welcome to our daddy's house. We're live from our daddy's couch.

8
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:01,280
Let me check this. Let me check the spaghettometer,

9
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:03,680
because it looks like we're going full blown pasta.

10
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:08,400
Spaghettiton. Spaghettagettin' 2011.

11
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:13,360
As you well know, as you've probably guessed, we had a- we carbo-loaded pre-show

12
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:19,440
here in Ironton. Our stepmom Carol fed us a bunch of spaghetti.

13
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:22,480
We're fucking primed for calling it spaghetti.

14
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:27,040
She looked down at us and said, you're not fucking funny enough,

15
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:30,240
eat some more spaghetti. She shoved spaghett-

16
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:33,120
fistful after fistful of sweet spaghett into my mouth.

17
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:36,800
I am ready to blow. Noodle up, you unfunny fucks.

18
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:42,560
It's time to get spaghett. You got spaghett.

19
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:46,960
Spaghett, you fucker. You got spaghettin'.

20
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:50,080
For real though, rough and raw, I know people have become accustomed

21
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:53,120
to a certain level of editing juice applied to this show.

22
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:55,440
This is not going to be one of those apps that's going to be rough, raw.

23
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:57,120
Just cut it, set it, forget it.

24
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:02,320
We are gathered around one mic. The last time we did this,

25
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:04,720
two of us were jet lagged. And I was drunk.

26
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:07,680
And Travis was drunk. So it's not going to be like this.

27
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:10,880
This is My Brother, My Brother, Me. It's an advice show for the modern era.

28
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:14,800
I am your most excellent eldest brother, Justin McElroy.

29
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:17,120
And I am the middle-est brother, Travis McElroy.

30
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:19,440
And I'm Griffin. And I'm a child.

31
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:22,160
This is an advice show. We take your questions and turn them into advice.

32
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:24,800
I am drinking a red stripe,

33
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:26,800
since this show is coming to you straight from the islands.

34
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:30,480
I've got a red stripe going, and an amber brown.

35
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:33,200
No, honey brown. Excuse me, pardon me.

36
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:36,480
Travis got a beer before we started, and then said,

37
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:40,320
I'm going to need a beer. He had a beer. He has a backup beer waiting.

38
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:43,840
So just so you guys know, if I need an extra burst of energy, you'll hear quiet.

39
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:47,520
And you'll know, because we'll draw attention to it.

40
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:48,400
Our first question.

41
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:51,040
At some point, also, our daddy's going to come in the room and take pictures of us.

42
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:52,800
No joke. And it's going to be super distraught.

43
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,960
It's going to throw us off whatever dope rhythm we're on.

44
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:57,440
So get ready for that moment.

45
00:02:57,440 --> 00:02:58,480
I hope he's not at the...

46
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:01,040
If he is, if he comes through that door in the single tier,

47
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:02,880
because he just heard you said that, I'm never forgiving you.

48
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:05,040
I am getting married this summer,

49
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:08,080
and one of my groomsmen is getting married a few months after me.

50
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:10,720
He is having a very small destination wedding,

51
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:14,400
and has decided to specifically not give his friends plus ones,

52
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:15,440
even if they are married.

53
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:18,240
My soon-to-be wife is understandably upset about this.

54
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:19,520
Some people think she talked...

55
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:23,680
Oh, some people she talked to think that I should decline

56
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:26,000
to go to the wedding because she wasn't invited.

57
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,200
Ideally, I would like my fiancé to be invited,

58
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:32,880
but I also understand my friend's choice to not invite any plus ones,

59
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:35,840
given how small the wedding will be.

60
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:40,960
How can I support my good friend and my fiancé at the same time,

61
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:44,000
as from Tristan, not the marine?

62
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,920
Not the marine.

63
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:47,680
Tristan, Tristan, civilian Tristan.

64
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:49,200
Civilian Tristan, Civvy Trist.

65
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:53,760
Wow, that is...

66
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:57,200
Susan, you didn't want to go to Cabo anyway, right?

67
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:58,240
You were just talking the other week

68
00:03:58,240 --> 00:03:59,840
about how much you hate destination weddings.

69
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:00,800
Don't take this personally,

70
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:03,520
but Derek specifically does not want you there.

71
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:04,400
It's a destination...

72
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:06,160
The destination is Des Moines.

73
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:07,120
It's not gonna be a big deal.

74
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:09,040
Man, that's brutal.

75
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:11,760
What a great way to start off your wedded life,

76
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:13,360
just pissing off everybody.

77
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:14,160
Yeah.

78
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:18,480
I honestly think that straight up...

79
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:20,480
You can't go.

80
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:21,280
I wouldn't go.

81
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:22,640
I mean, honestly, if they...

82
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:25,600
The thing about a wedding is,

83
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:30,160
as much as it is for you guys,

84
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:33,840
it's just as much, if not more so,

85
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:35,920
for the people that are sort of gathered there.

86
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:37,440
I know it's their special day and what all,

87
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:41,440
but I think that it is a slight.

88
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:42,480
I mean, it's like a...

89
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:43,760
It's especially...

90
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:45,520
It's like, because it's your friend

91
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:48,720
who's in your wedding saying,

92
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:50,480
whether he has thought about it or not,

93
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:52,320
saying, hey, I know you just got married

94
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:55,120
and are happily wedded for all of three months,

95
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:57,120
but you're gonna need to leave her behind.

96
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:59,280
Like that's a dick move.

97
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:01,280
Yeah, especially he's getting married

98
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:03,600
a few months after the question asked her.

99
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:05,840
So she's gonna be your wife when that happens.

100
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:07,120
You can't leave your wife behind,

101
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:11,120
especially, especially not if you're going someplace nice.

102
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:14,480
Like really, that is not the way to kick off your...

103
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:17,280
Destination weddings are the most whorish thing

104
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:18,240
you can do, right?

105
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:19,280
It's terrible already.

106
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:23,280
The only way it flies to me is if you invite no one.

107
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:25,520
If it's just like we were creepy sneaky

108
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:27,120
and we bolted out of there,

109
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:29,440
please come and give us presents in a big room.

110
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:31,600
What about webcast wedding?

111
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:32,720
Web casting.

112
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:34,400
Who's invited? Everyone.

113
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:36,240
Because everyone's got an internet connection nowadays.

114
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:37,600
You got Ustream on that phone?

115
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:38,320
You're invited?

116
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:42,240
Justin TV my wedding, please.

117
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:44,480
I'm happy to TV anyone's wedding, by the way.

118
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:45,920
It's for a very reasonable fee.

119
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:46,240
Thank you.

120
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Honestly, Tristan, you are going to learn very soon

121
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,680
that choosing the side of your wife

122
00:05:56,320 --> 00:06:00,640
is almost never not the right thing to do.

123
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:02,000
I'm not sure how my negatives are.

124
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,600
How fucked up is your friend that he's like,

125
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:06,080
I want you to come, but not your other half.

126
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:07,040
Not your better half.

127
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:10,320
And I say that kudos to you for realizing how big an influence-

128
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:12,960
God, you are ahead of the fucking game, bro.

129
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:13,760
Good job.

130
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:14,400
I'm proud of you.

131
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:15,200
See you, honey.

132
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:16,720
A worser man would have been like,

133
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:19,840
hey, did I remember to pack my trunks and my goggles,

134
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:20,880
but not my wife?

135
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:21,840
Okay, cool, I'm out.

136
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:23,680
Got the banana boat.

137
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:26,320
Don't have Barbara.

138
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:27,840
Don't got my SO, but-

139
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:28,480
Sorry.

140
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:29,120
Sorry, Tristan.

141
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:30,560
I know that's awkward.

142
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:32,320
But honestly, that's the kind of awkward

143
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:33,120
you can feel good about,

144
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:34,000
especially if you're going to be married.

145
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:34,720
You got to get used to-

146
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:36,800
You guys are a team now.

147
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:38,400
It's a package deal,

148
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:40,560
especially if you're going to be legally married.

149
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:41,520
It's not like she's your girlfriend.

150
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:42,960
It's a package deal.

151
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:46,560
It might be worth it to talk to your groomsman

152
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:48,880
and be like, hey, I'm bringing her.

153
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:50,560
And if he's like, well, it's a small wedding,

154
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:52,160
then say, okay, then I can't come.

155
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:53,920
Yeah, put that shit back on him.

156
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:55,120
Put that ball right back in his court.

157
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:56,640
Yeah, this is his decision to make.

158
00:06:56,640 --> 00:06:57,920
It's you two or nothing.

159
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:03,200
On Mother's Day, I took my mom to an ice cafe in NYC for lunch.

160
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:05,680
After we finished eating, she needed to use the restroom.

161
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:08,960
However, there was a woman ahead of her on the line,

162
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:10,720
and both of them had to wait for a long time

163
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:12,160
for the occupant to finish,

164
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:14,480
even though the men's room remained unoccupied.

165
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:16,400
I told her she should just have used the men's room.

166
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:17,920
It was as clean as the women's.

167
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:19,600
The only difference between the two bathrooms

168
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:20,880
was the sign on the door.

169
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:22,320
They were both single toilet rooms,

170
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:25,040
so there was no danger of running into someone

171
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:27,120
of the opposite sex in the bathroom.

172
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:30,160
It's also fairly common for women to use the men's room

173
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:31,360
at an overcrowded bar.

174
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:31,680
Is it?

175
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:35,280
What is someone supposed to do in a situation like this?

176
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:40,400
Is the inverse true for men using the women's restroom?

177
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:41,600
It's from Jordan.

178
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:42,720
God, no.

179
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:43,120
No.

180
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:44,320
No to everything.

181
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:45,280
No to all of that?

182
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:46,160
No to everything.

183
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:46,640
I've...

184
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:48,160
Here's what's up.

185
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:48,640
Okay.

186
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:54,080
When you are a gentleman or a lady living and surviving

187
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:57,040
and just barely getting by on the skin of your teeth

188
00:07:57,040 --> 00:08:00,000
and your charm alone with irritable bowel syndrome,

189
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:05,680
like when you see a wrong gender person in your right bathroom,

190
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:07,280
you get so fucking angry.

191
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:08,880
You get so angry because it's like...

192
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:11,680
For me, it's always an emergency.

193
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:14,960
So it's like I have to go right now, but I can't go.

194
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:16,000
There has to...

195
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:16,800
There better be a good...

196
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:19,200
There better be a goddamn great explanation for this.

197
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:22,960
I'm gonna counterpoint by saying I love using the ladies room.

198
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:23,440
And I was...

199
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:24,480
It's painted better.

200
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:25,440
It's cleaner.

201
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:27,520
It's weird how they have lounges sometimes.

202
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:28,560
Yeah, it's nice.

203
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:29,520
Better hand soap.

204
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:30,160
Are you being serious?

205
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:30,800
Yeah.

206
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:31,520
Yeah, sure, sure.

207
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:35,600
Is there a legal law that says you can't do that?

208
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:36,400
A legal law?

209
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:36,640
No.

210
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:41,760
Did someone take a bill to Congress and pass it with the president

211
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:43,120
that said you can't do that?

212
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:43,360
No.

213
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:46,000
It's just signs.

214
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,360
If you're in there with the intention of being a sneaky, creepy peeper,

215
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:51,120
I think that is illegal.

216
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:56,240
I call when I get rid of waste in the bathroom, I call it peeping.

217
00:08:57,280 --> 00:08:59,280
So you'll have to be much more specific.

218
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:00,880
I'm always creepy about it.

219
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:01,760
What is the problem?

220
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:02,640
They're just holes.

221
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:03,680
What, your butt?

222
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:05,040
Your butt hole in people?

223
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:06,720
No, I mean, you're just...

224
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:08,000
Oh, like a lady's vagina?

225
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,040
No, like the holes that you leave the bad things in.

226
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:12,880
Like, they're just holes.

227
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:14,400
Like, what does it matter?

228
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:15,360
The turlet holes.

229
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:18,320
Why are you so adherent to society's rules is what I'm saying.

230
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:19,040
Because my...

231
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:21,520
Have you seen a little show called Ally McBeal?

232
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:21,760
Yeah.

233
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:23,440
Unisex bathrooms, my friend.

234
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:24,080
Sure, sure, sure.

235
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:24,960
Way for the future.

236
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:25,520
Ooga chaka.

237
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:25,840
I dig it.

238
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:26,400
But listen.

239
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:27,840
I'm just getting old.

240
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:28,480
Listen, listen, listen.

241
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:29,520
I'm really vain.

242
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:34,480
My worst fear, 100% of the time, even when I'm not peeping,

243
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:37,280
my worst fear is that someone's gonna walk in on me on the bathroom.

244
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:41,520
If I'm in the men's room and somebody walks in and sees my bits and everything

245
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:44,480
and like a full-grown poop coming out of me, like,

246
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:48,160
if a dude sees that, I am haunted.

247
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:50,400
I am aghast.

248
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:54,240
If a lady sees it, I will commit sex poop on the SPOT.

249
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:57,840
I'll tell you right now, the biggest fear is when I'm using the bathroom

250
00:09:57,840 --> 00:10:00,720
in the ladies room and the handle jiggles.

251
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:01,040
Oh, yeah.

252
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:02,080
Like, they were trying...

253
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:06,480
Then you're trapped in this situation where you're like, oh no.

254
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:06,880
Yeah.

255
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:07,760
They're like, are you done?

256
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:08,800
And you're like, I am now.

257
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:13,040
I have the weight of the world on my shoulders now.

258
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:15,600
And then you gotta do a Mrs. Doubtfire style, like,

259
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:18,480
put the keg on your face and sneak out before they realize you're a dude.

260
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:23,760
I wanted to point something out real quick about bathrooms that made me laugh today.

261
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:25,920
Actually, yesterday it occurred to me.

262
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:27,840
I was at the movie theaters in the bathroom.

263
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:33,920
And for me, it does not get better than when two guys are in a bathroom

264
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:36,240
and one guy just toots like it's nothing.

265
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:40,480
Like, all of society's rules have, like, crumbled around him.

266
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:43,600
And there's nothing more hysterical than a guy dropping it.

267
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:44,400
Like, what?

268
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:45,120
What's up?

269
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:46,000
Check it.

270
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:46,400
Check.

271
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:47,120
Check that out.

272
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:47,840
Check what I just did for you.

273
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:49,040
What are you gonna say now?

274
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:49,680
What's up?

275
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:50,960
Whose rule is roost?

276
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:52,000
You guys want a yahoo?

277
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:52,720
Yeah, give it to me.

278
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:56,720
Uh, this spaghetti-fueled yahoo is brought to you by Nick Jensen.

279
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:57,600
Thank you, Nick Jensen.

280
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:58,400
And ragu.

281
00:10:58,400 --> 00:10:59,200
Thank you, ragu.

282
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:02,560
It's by Yahoo Answers user Darcy B who says,

283
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:08,480
should I try out for my sweet 16 or 16 and pregnant?

284
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:10,800
Really think about it.

285
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:15,280
I really want my 15-minute fame, so I am going to try and get on MTV.

286
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:18,000
I was thinking maybe my parents could throw a big party for me

287
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,920
and I could appear on my sweet 16.

288
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:24,720
Although, if I sign up for 16 and pregnant, I could also go on Teen Mom afterwards.

289
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:26,960
This would give me more chance in the public eye.

290
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:28,400
Uh-huh.

291
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:32,320
So she's saying, should my parents throw me a big party or should I get knocked out?

292
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:34,560
Should I get pregnant and then get double fame?

293
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:35,920
Well, no, this is ridiculous.

294
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:36,960
This is so stupid.

295
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:39,280
Have the super sweet 16.

296
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:42,000
Announce during super sweet 16, by the way.

297
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,120
I'm gonna get knocked up.

298
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:44,240
I'm fucking on it.

299
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:47,120
No, make the super sweet 16 about knocking her out.

300
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:48,880
Like, the knocking up theme party.

301
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:50,240
So it's a super-duper sweet 16.

302
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:50,800
Yeah.

303
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:57,680
I think that in this high-pressure society, you have to try to get on as many TV shows as possible.

304
00:11:57,680 --> 00:11:58,480
Absolutely.

305
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:01,120
So you're saying, could we do something?

306
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:02,160
Could we do, what's that?

307
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:04,960
You could do super sweet 16 and 16 and pregnant,

308
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:08,720
and also maybe you have a really challenging cake you need baked for your party.

309
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:10,080
And then you have to get on Cakebox.

310
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:15,440
What's the one where they make the real-ass little baby girls look like creepy-ass porcelain dolls?

311
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:16,560
That's not on MTV.

312
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:18,880
That's not on MTV.

313
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:20,160
We're talking single channel.

314
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:20,720
Single channel.

315
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:21,600
Here's what I'm suggesting.

316
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:22,160
X Factor.

317
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:25,600
True life, I'm a man in a woman's body.

318
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:26,240
Okay.

319
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:27,760
Then you switch it and you're-

320
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:28,320
No, no, no.

321
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:29,920
True life, I'm a woman in a man's body.

322
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:31,280
And then you do made.

323
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:34,000
At that point, you are an unofficial MTV VJ.

324
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:34,240
Right.

325
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:36,080
You're like the Jesse.

326
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:37,440
You're basically Sway at that point.

327
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:38,800
You're basically Sway.

328
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:44,080
And then what you want to do is get on super sweet 16 during the party, get knocked up.

329
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:46,480
Uh-huh. You're saying like chain it.

330
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:48,720
So like an entire like nine-year career.

331
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:50,000
A c-c-c-combo.

332
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:56,160
But I have to be honest, I'm not sure the human frame can withstand.

333
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:58,320
Can your frame handle the fame is my question.

334
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:01,440
Are you famous enough?

335
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:04,240
Actually, that is the plot to Real Housewives of New Jersey.

336
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:05,760
So they got that trademark.

337
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:07,120
Poor Sway.

338
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:08,080
He's doing his best.

339
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:09,920
His parents named him Sway.

340
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:11,120
What do you want from him?

341
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:15,120
A couple of weeks ago, one of my friends invited me to his bachelor party in Vegas.

342
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:18,880
However, about a week before we were supposed to leave,

343
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:21,440
he calls me and says that a couple of guys couldn't make it.

344
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:24,160
So they were going to reschedule it sometime during the summer.

345
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:28,720
On the day we're supposed to go to Vegas, I got a text from him that was meant for his fiancee

346
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:31,680
saying that they had got to the rooms in Vegas.

347
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:33,040
They're heading out to the casinos.

348
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:35,520
Should I confront him about this?

349
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:38,000
Do I even go to the wedding after I got royally dicked over?

350
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:39,440
Thanks, brothers.

351
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:42,320
That's from Sulking in San Diego.

352
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:44,800
So they gave this guy the fucking San Diego slip.

353
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:46,800
Became the San Diego slip, yes.

354
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:49,520
And then he doesn't, he doesn't.

355
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:50,880
What was the guy's fob after that?

356
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:52,880
Like, oh, I guess I canceled my bachelor party.

357
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:54,160
We're not having it anymore.

358
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:55,440
Now you don't get to come.

359
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:57,120
Well, what I love is I love that.

360
00:13:57,120 --> 00:14:01,360
I love his optimism that he thinks his friend accidentally sent him that text.

361
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:03,520
Or is he maybe like, hey, surprise.

362
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:04,960
We're in our hotel rooms.

363
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:06,080
Hey, can you get to Vegas?

364
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:08,000
Like, dog, we live in Ann Arbor, Michigan.

365
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,920
I absolutely can't get down to Vegas.

366
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:10,880
No, we can't do that.

367
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:15,200
What's up with this show being the theme of dick friends?

368
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:18,960
Like, hey, of all the, hey, hey, hey, bachelor.

369
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:20,800
Hey, hey, hey, potential groom.

370
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:24,880
You fucked that text up the worst you could possibly do it.

371
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:28,720
We're also having a great time and so glad Bobby's not here.

372
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:32,400
Hey, honey, I'm getting, I'm getting my dick wet.

373
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:33,680
Oops, Bobby.

374
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:34,640
No, no.

375
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:38,960
No, you, why did I marry a girl named Bobby?

376
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:40,960
My good friend name.

377
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:41,840
So what do you think that?

378
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:46,560
So sulky in San Diego is just sort of the, he's like the uncool one in the group and

379
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:50,400
the group wanted to leave him behind or got a bad rap and like a bum rap.

380
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:52,240
You got a bum rap and I don't know.

381
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:53,120
I don't know what to tell you.

382
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:53,680
He's not.

383
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:55,840
I do one word rampage.

384
00:14:55,840 --> 00:14:56,320
Okay.

385
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:56,800
Oh shit.

386
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:57,360
I like it.

387
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:58,160
Tell me more.

388
00:14:58,160 --> 00:14:59,280
You're going to Vegas.

389
00:14:59,280 --> 00:15:00,320
You're flipping tables.

390
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:02,560
I'm saying roll up to Vegas.

391
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:04,160
Sunglasses on cigarette.

392
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:04,720
That lit.

393
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:05,760
Gun loaded.

394
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:06,960
Chilling with rampage.

395
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:09,040
Chilling with Rampage Jackson, the fighter.

396
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:09,280
Yeah.

397
00:15:09,280 --> 00:15:09,840
Yeah.

398
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:12,960
Befriend all the pit bosses you can find and like say that guy over there.

399
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:15,600
Ocean's Eleven style, like huge con.

400
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:17,920
Try to steal his wedding.

401
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:19,280
Steal your dignity back.

402
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:19,680
No.

403
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:20,640
Steal the wedding.

404
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:21,360
Steal the wedding.

405
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:22,400
Now it's your wedding.

406
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:23,840
Are those carnations?

407
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:24,960
Gotta get them, Danny.

408
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:28,000
Oh, I like this sulking.

409
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:32,480
You are going to have to go A, full Ocean's Eleven, steal the wedding, hijack, heist,

410
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:33,520
loving it.

411
00:15:33,520 --> 00:15:34,960
I got tiny Korean man.

412
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:37,360
He jumped through the window of the church, got the whole cake.

413
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:40,080
Is that in one joke?

414
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:40,960
Is that a priest?

415
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:41,440
Nope.

416
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:42,400
It's Scott Conn.

417
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:48,320
Casey Affleck is there.

418
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:51,520
We're not 100% sure in one capacity.

419
00:15:51,520 --> 00:15:53,520
Scott Conn is actually a legal minister though.

420
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:56,240
Minister in the Presbyterian church.

421
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:57,120
A lot of people don't know that.

422
00:15:57,920 --> 00:15:59,200
You guys want another Yahoo?

423
00:15:59,200 --> 00:15:59,760
Yes, please.

424
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:00,320
Yes, please.

425
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:04,160
Uh, oh, God, I should have looked at these ahead of time.

426
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:05,600
How about this?

427
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:08,640
So I sent it by Jacob Locker.

428
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:11,360
It's by Yahoo Answers user Mark.

429
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:13,920
Thank you, Jacob Locker, for giving us this.

430
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:18,480
Mark asks, why is this woman farting on my wife at the gym?

431
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:23,120
Every time my wife and I go to the gym, a lady probably in her mid 40s decides to go

432
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:25,280
near her and fart the first few times.

433
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:28,400
My wife would give me a funny look and we would later laugh about it.

434
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:30,480
We'll get back to that.

435
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:35,440
But by the seventh or eighth time, my wife has become considerably annoyed.

436
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:37,200
She even said to the woman, excuse you.

437
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:40,560
And the woman completely ignored her, farted again, and then walked away.

438
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:45,120
Should we complain to the gym's management or could this lady have a problem?

439
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:49,840
It's strange that she only farts on my wife and no one else at the gym.

440
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:50,800
Have you checked around?

441
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:52,240
Did you ask?

442
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:53,280
What is you?

443
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:55,680
It qualifies as a fetish.

444
00:16:55,680 --> 00:17:01,200
If after seven to eight times, all you're doing is saying, excuse you, that is not a

445
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:06,800
passive aggression is maybe the first time it happens or the half the half time it happens

446
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:07,920
because it's unacceptable.

447
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:10,240
And then they get punched right in the butt.

448
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:15,680
By seven or eight, we're at like restraining order and or butt punches.

449
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:16,880
Yeah.

450
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:21,680
By the second time, you should ask if you can pull down the front of their tank top

451
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:22,400
and puke down it.

452
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:25,920
Because I would like to know, can we rewind back to you?

453
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:31,040
I would like to know the look that has exchanged and I think this lady just farted on me.

454
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:34,800
Okay, that's that's that's the sticking point because stinking point.

455
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:41,920
A human being just expelled gas on your wife, on your betrothed.

456
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:47,760
And what you did was she looked at you like, no, like, okay, did you get?

457
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:49,360
This is going to be a fun story later.

458
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:50,960
Like, no, it isn't.

459
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:51,840
You got farted on.

460
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:53,440
That's gross and disrespectful.

461
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:55,040
I can't even look at you anymore.

462
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:55,280
Yeah.

463
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:57,760
How am I supposed to make love to you?

464
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,200
By the way, I want a divorce.

465
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:03,040
I need a divorce.

466
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:06,560
Thank you so much, exercise Debbie.

467
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:07,200
You're a bitch.

468
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:11,120
This question was asked two days ago.

469
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:15,920
How many more times is this woman going to continue to terrorize this couple?

470
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:17,120
It is one woman, right?

471
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:18,000
It's just one.

472
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,400
Is it like just one woman or is this one serial?

473
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:22,080
Dude is a Jack the Ripper.

474
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:27,520
She's got she's got some sort of crazy obsession.

475
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:29,600
Like fucking one hour photo with this white.

476
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:34,880
Instead of like jerking off the pictures of their family's photo,

477
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:36,960
she's farting on only the wife at the gym.

478
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:38,400
Cut it out, everybody.

479
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:38,960
Cut it out.

480
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:41,520
You just ruin the fun.

481
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:42,960
Yeah, at least go.

482
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:48,960
I want that Robin Williams fart on me all day long, which is I think pretty much what

483
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:50,160
he did during license to wed.

484
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:56,960
Is it is there a possible that this middle aged woman is Robin Williams in a way?

485
00:18:58,640 --> 00:18:59,760
It's really good.

486
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:03,440
My favorite part of the email is she says, excuse you.

487
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:04,800
In a manner, it says, please leave.

488
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:08,400
And the woman's response is she farts once more and then tips.

489
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:09,120
Excuse me.

490
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:10,000
No, fuck you.

491
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,280
No, no, no, no.

492
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,440
She's a drive by tutor.

493
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:18,800
I think that's a down fire deep cut.

494
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,840
What's everyone's favorite line from what you say?

495
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:28,880
Bring them out.

496
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:29,920
Oh, fuck.

497
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:30,640
Oh, Jesus.

498
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:38,160
I like when you get your junior career to start to like slide right down that hill.

499
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:44,240
Griffin, let's we've been sitting on this couch and it's honestly it's made me a little

500
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:47,520
stir the pasta is actually settled heavy in my gut.

501
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:50,080
Yeah, it's made me a little stir crazy.

502
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:53,680
And it made me want to take a little journey with my two brothers.

503
00:19:53,680 --> 00:20:14,560
Do you know where I don't know where we've already joined so much today.

504
00:20:14,560 --> 00:20:18,880
So we've got a very happy birthday message to one.

505
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:23,600
Sherilyn is from her children, Eloise and Jordan, I hope they don't listen.

506
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:25,680
Well, they are four and two.

507
00:20:25,680 --> 00:20:26,960
So they do listen.

508
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:28,320
Wow.

509
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:32,000
They either don't understand or they understand so deeply.

510
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,880
First of all, these kids have no idea who Robin Williams is.

511
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:41,360
We should actually have a you know, how how deaf people have an interpreter there.

512
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:43,440
We need something like that for kids like Robin Williams.

513
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:45,760
He's like he's like he's like Barney.

514
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:48,720
We get Robin Williams to interpret for himself.

515
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:51,520
This is how I relate to I'm like the he's the genie in Aladdin.

516
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:52,800
Well, there's that.

517
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:57,120
But I mean, even that might watch Aladdin, you know, the man you see on TV sometimes

518
00:20:57,120 --> 00:20:59,840
and he looks like he's on his like third or fourth heart.

519
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:03,280
And also his hands are carpeted just related to death.

520
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:04,240
The synergy.

521
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:04,720
Yeah.

522
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:04,960
Okay.

523
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:10,160
So this from Sherilyn.

524
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:12,720
The message is from Jordan Eloise.

525
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:15,680
These kids are super fucking smart.

526
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:17,760
They're really they're emailing.

527
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:25,120
She is an editor of scientific documents, particularly for French scientists, which

528
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:28,080
means she's probably smarter than the whole couch.

529
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:29,280
Or a secret agent.

530
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:33,520
That sounds like a job that someone comes up with and like, oh, she edits science documents

531
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:38,000
for doesn't seem like that's every every role that Nicole Kidman has ever played in a movie.

532
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:40,560
I'm a science editor for French Sciences.

533
00:21:40,560 --> 00:21:46,640
I'm not okay with you taking French science and giving it the old American spit shine.

534
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:51,360
Yeah, I would prefer that we keep our science here in our borders safe and sound.

535
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:51,600
Right.

536
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:52,960
We had to develop our science.

537
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:56,480
We had to develop it and you're just giving it away for free for France or whatever your

538
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:56,960
salary is.

539
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:58,720
What I'm saying is I'll pay your salary.

540
00:21:58,720 --> 00:21:59,280
Stop it.

541
00:21:59,280 --> 00:21:59,760
Stop it.

542
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:00,400
Stop doing it.

543
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:01,520
I'll put your kids through college.

544
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:04,880
So the little kids aren't listeners yet.

545
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:08,160
We hope that when they get to be older, they will be listeners.

546
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:12,720
And Sherilyn, of course, Sherilyn Woltrop, happy birthday to you.

547
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:14,560
We hope you have a great one.

548
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:17,360
Shit, because this just changed from a birthday message to a time capsule.

549
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:18,480
Oh, yeah.

550
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:19,280
Hey, kids.

551
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:21,360
I hope you're at least 16.

552
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:21,920
16.

553
00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:22,960
So 12 years from now.

554
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:25,360
A good or a mature 14.

555
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:26,320
Oh, here comes daddy.

556
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:29,200
Very discreet.

557
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:29,840
Hold on.

558
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:30,480
Every smile.

559
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:31,520
It's a time capsule.

560
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:33,360
It's a time capsule for your kids.

561
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:34,880
And we're making a time capsule right now.

562
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:36,560
Oh, but my hair looks terrible.

563
00:22:36,560 --> 00:22:37,520
Not a father.

564
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:44,880
So our other our other journey that we're taking to the money zone is our buddy James

565
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:46,880
Gowdy, who is who is I don't know if you see him.

566
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:50,240
He's active on the Twitter, active on the Twitter, constantly promoting the show and

567
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:50,960
on the beat.

568
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:54,880
He's on the beat because he's a police officer for the London Metropolitan Police, the Met

569
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:55,440
Police.

570
00:22:55,440 --> 00:23:00,320
And he is going to be in B&B AM's resident policeman.

571
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:01,520
So he's British, right?

572
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:01,840
Yeah.

573
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:02,400
He's a Brit.

574
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:02,880
Brit.

575
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:06,080
They don't get guns, right?

576
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:07,200
They have all guns.

577
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:07,600
They are.

578
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:08,560
Their arms are guns.

579
00:23:10,160 --> 00:23:10,320
Yeah.

580
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:14,960
They make them surgically replace their arms with guns and not like the chintzy.

581
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:16,720
Like, look at the gun gun.

582
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:20,480
You're saying, I mean, right.

583
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:23,680
He fires a pint of Guinness right into someone's face.

584
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:28,000
You can find him Gowdy James on Twitter if you if you'd like to follow him.

585
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,120
Everyone crush him.

586
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:30,800
Just crush him with followers.

587
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:34,400
And oh, he says I should throw in my English accent, too.

588
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:40,080
So here's what I think it sounds like when a British person is a cop, is a cop.

589
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:40,320
Hold on.

590
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:43,680
Wait, why don't I just play the song, the jingle, and you can sing British cop lyrics

591
00:23:43,680 --> 00:23:44,240
over it.

592
00:23:44,240 --> 00:24:01,360
You son of a bitch.

593
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:03,920
He's Gowdy, but she's not Gowdy.

594
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:06,960
She's a French scientist editor.

595
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:08,400
He's a cop on the beat.

596
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:12,400
She joins him on the street.

597
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:16,480
Unconventional partners work in the beat.

598
00:24:17,680 --> 00:24:20,880
It's Gowdy and not Dowdy Sherilyn.

599
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:24,480
Hey, there's a crime.

600
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:27,520
Can you make it rhyme with tree?

601
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:32,240
That's the only French word I know.

602
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:38,560
Gowdy and not Dowdy Sherilyn.

603
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:42,240
Canceled after three episodes.

604
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:47,760
Rabid fan base conventions.

605
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:52,400
Yeah, they got them for Gowdy and not Dowdy Sherilyn.

606
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:53,840
Hey, Eloise.

607
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:54,880
Hey, other kids.

608
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:57,280
Sorry I scrolled away from your name.

609
00:24:58,080 --> 00:24:59,520
Happy birthday.

610
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:02,640
Happy 14th and 16th birthday.

611
00:25:03,680 --> 00:25:05,360
Asynchronous twins.

612
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:08,240
French science.

613
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:09,200
British crime.

614
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:15,760
Gowdy and not Gowdy.

615
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:21,280
Yeah, she's never party.

616
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:24,000
Governor.

617
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:26,400
Lovener.

618
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:27,920
I should say so.

619
00:25:27,920 --> 00:25:33,840
Gowdy and not Dowdy Sherilyn.

620
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:36,800
There we go.

621
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:37,680
That's the Money Zone.

622
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:39,920
I love it.

623
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:41,040
Yeah, I love it too.

624
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:42,080
I looked away for a second.

625
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:44,080
I was like, whoa, is that Liam Gallagher?

626
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:46,160
Yeah, is it Liam Gallagher?

627
00:25:46,160 --> 00:25:46,560
Is he here?

628
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:49,440
So that was our journey in the Money Zone.

629
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:50,240
They're brothers too.

630
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:51,040
They're brothers too.

631
00:25:51,040 --> 00:25:51,600
Did you know that?

632
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:52,400
The strokes?

633
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:55,680
If you're interested in joining us for a trip to the Money Zone,

634
00:25:55,680 --> 00:25:59,120
you can contact Teresa at maximumfun.org.

635
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:00,400
That is Teresa with an H.

636
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:02,960
I'm a lesbian and I...

637
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:04,800
Okay, that was British.

638
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:05,040
Okay.

639
00:26:06,560 --> 00:26:13,840
I'm a lesbian and I recently cut my hair.

640
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:15,520
But now I'm having second thoughts.

641
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:17,440
Before it was all the way down to my waist.

642
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:19,360
Now it's more a men's style cut.

643
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:22,880
Although still long enough to show my loverly curls.

644
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:24,400
I think it looks cute.

645
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:28,080
It's very low maintenance and it seems to be net positive with the ladies.

646
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:31,120
But I've noticed that strangers are ruder to me.

647
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:33,680
Should I stick it out and get used to being perceived differently by people

648
00:26:33,680 --> 00:26:37,200
or grow my hair long and lovely again so as to fly to the gaydar

649
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:40,640
and avoid the occasional embarrassing mistake about my gender?

650
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:43,120
Fan from the post lesbian apocalypse.

651
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:46,880
Is she asking us if she should be proud of her lesbianity?

652
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:47,840
Her lesbianics?

653
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:50,400
Well, she wants to be a lesbian.

654
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:51,920
She doesn't want to be mistaken for a dude.

655
00:26:52,560 --> 00:26:53,120
Okay.

656
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:54,480
But I guess that's...

657
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:55,920
I do have to tell you though,

658
00:26:56,800 --> 00:27:01,680
this decision is largely out of your hands for the next month or so.

659
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:03,200
So here's my advice.

660
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,400
Try it for a month and see what you think.

661
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:09,360
If you still don't like it, go along then.

662
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:09,840
Here's...

663
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:12,960
There are worse things that you could be mistaken for than a dude.

664
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:14,400
Do you know what I'm saying?

665
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:15,200
Liam Gallagher.

666
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:15,760
Liam Gallagher.

667
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:17,120
No, fucking Bieber.

668
00:27:17,680 --> 00:27:18,400
Bieber.

669
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:19,040
You can look...

670
00:27:19,040 --> 00:27:23,200
You can get a Bieber, a sweet Bieber bowl and then you are in a lot of trouble.

671
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:26,000
Unless your name is Justin and your last name is Bieber.

672
00:27:26,560 --> 00:27:28,720
And your middle name is whatever Justin Bieber's name is.

673
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:29,520
Saul.

674
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:30,320
Saul.

675
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:32,960
Justin Saul Bieber.

676
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:36,000
Justin Schmoo Bieber.

677
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,200
No, here's all that coming.

678
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:42,240
No, you know, it actually is Justin Osama Bieber.

679
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:45,280
A lot of people don't know that.

680
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:48,240
A lot of people don't know that.

681
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:49,120
Hussein Bieber.

682
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:49,920
Justin Hannah Montana Bieber.

683
00:27:49,920 --> 00:27:50,640
You know what?

684
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:55,680
If you like it, if you like it, if you like your haircut, it's yours.

685
00:27:55,680 --> 00:27:56,480
It's your haircut.

686
00:27:56,480 --> 00:27:57,280
Own it.

687
00:27:57,280 --> 00:27:57,680
Yeah.

688
00:27:57,680 --> 00:27:58,240
Fuck people.

689
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:01,280
Listen, if they're going to think you're a dude, they're obviously somebody you don't

690
00:28:01,280 --> 00:28:02,160
know very well.

691
00:28:02,160 --> 00:28:06,000
That's a pretty good litmus test as to whether or not they're useless.

692
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:06,800
Hey, are you a dude?

693
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:07,280
No.

694
00:28:07,280 --> 00:28:08,160
Like, fuck you.

695
00:28:08,160 --> 00:28:08,800
Get out of here.

696
00:28:08,800 --> 00:28:09,120
I don't...

697
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:10,560
Like, I obviously don't want to chill with you.

698
00:28:10,560 --> 00:28:11,600
Look at my shapeliness.

699
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:13,920
Look at my shapely curvaceousness.

700
00:28:13,920 --> 00:28:15,520
Look at this boom-bastic body.

701
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:18,320
Excuse me?

702
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:22,320
Don't you wish your girlfriend was hot and slightly androgynous like me?

703
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:25,200
Is my favorite pussycat doll song.

704
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:27,360
There are so many, though.

705
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:27,680
It's hard to choose.

706
00:28:27,680 --> 00:28:28,480
Yeah, there are so many.

707
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:29,440
Buttons is good, too.

708
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:30,000
Buttons is good.

709
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:30,960
Pushing up my buttons.

710
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:31,440
I like that.

711
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:33,360
Mr. Boom-bastic.

712
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:34,960
Mr. Boom-bastic.

713
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:35,920
Oh, holy life.

714
00:28:35,920 --> 00:28:36,800
Don't make me sweat.

715
00:28:38,560 --> 00:28:39,280
That's another one.

716
00:28:39,280 --> 00:28:44,240
Duel of the Fates.

717
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:48,240
Pussycat dolls are the most flexible artists of our times.

718
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:50,560
Feem from my closet.

719
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:56,000
They are unstoppable.

720
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:57,760
The Declaration of Independence.

721
00:28:58,640 --> 00:28:59,600
Yeah, that hit song.

722
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:01,840
Declaration of Independence.

723
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:02,240
What?

724
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:03,920
Now you're just naming documents.

725
00:29:03,920 --> 00:29:05,040
The Rosetta Stone.

726
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:06,800
That's him.

727
00:29:06,800 --> 00:29:07,760
The Sphinx.

728
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:09,760
The Empire State Building.

729
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:10,720
What are we doing?

730
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:15,040
We are fucked up our pasta.

731
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:17,760
Oh, shit.

732
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:18,400
Oh, my God.

733
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:19,520
Holy shit.

734
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:20,000
Jesus.

735
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:23,200
Oh, my God.

736
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:29,280
You just call me a self spaghetti.

737
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:32,000
I'm feeling this pasta vibe.

738
00:29:32,560 --> 00:29:34,400
I've got to answer.

739
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:34,720
Yes.

740
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:37,040
Oh, Christ.

741
00:29:39,280 --> 00:29:39,680
Let's see.

742
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:42,720
Declaration of Independence.

743
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:45,280
You thought that was the song in the heat of the moment, didn't you?

744
00:29:45,280 --> 00:29:46,000
You can admit it.

745
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:49,040
This one was sent in by John Ramsey.

746
00:29:49,040 --> 00:29:49,920
Thank you, John Ramsey.

747
00:29:49,920 --> 00:29:52,400
It's by Yahoo Answers user Pretty, who asks,

748
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:58,880
is marrying a robot, parentheses, with sexual capabilities, in parentheses,

749
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:02,080
or an animal more socially unacceptable?

750
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:03,040
Oh, God.

751
00:30:03,040 --> 00:30:06,960
The robot is designed so that you can, quotations, screw it.

752
00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:13,360
Is marrying a robot with sexual capabilities or an animal more socially,

753
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:15,200
we'll say, more socially acceptable?

754
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:16,320
Okay.

755
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:20,960
We're going to pretend that we don't live in the same universe as Beast Wars,

756
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:22,640
because I think that really matters a lot.

757
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:24,560
Yeah.

758
00:30:24,560 --> 00:30:28,960
Well, I think in the epic case, Robo V. Bobo.

759
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:31,440
Asshole.

760
00:30:35,280 --> 00:30:38,240
I think marrying a robot with sex capabilities is more acceptable,

761
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:42,880
because I have seen Lars in the real girl, but I haven't seen Lars in the real alligator.

762
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:47,680
I think the problem is that every time you introduce someone to your wife,

763
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:51,120
you have to say, this is my wife, a robot with sexual capabilities.

764
00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:52,160
Yeah, check it.

765
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:53,440
She's got holes in everything.

766
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:54,480
She is ready to party.

767
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:59,600
Is that better than, like, this is my wife, Tracy, she's not a real llama?

768
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:00,800
What's up with that art, Mark?

769
00:31:00,800 --> 00:31:02,480
Don't you talk about my wife like that.

770
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:03,440
We fuck all the time.

771
00:31:04,800 --> 00:31:07,680
Wait, so we're assuming the animal has sexual capabilities, right?

772
00:31:07,680 --> 00:31:08,800
It doesn't specify the question.

773
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:11,840
I think pretty much all animals, although it depends on the size,

774
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:16,720
because if we are talking about a porcupine, or, well, that's a bad example,

775
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:21,280
but, I don't know, a hamster, well, still, fuck.

776
00:31:21,280 --> 00:31:23,680
There's a lot of sexy animals out there, you guys.

777
00:31:23,680 --> 00:31:24,720
It is a minefield.

778
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:31,440
The worry, of course, with a fake girl is that you'll create an uncanny valley.

779
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:31,760
Yeah.

780
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:32,960
And that is the tightest leg.

781
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:39,360
Oh, man, this was just a little less canny.

782
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:45,520
Also, yeah, I worry about self-actualization, what's it called?

783
00:31:45,520 --> 00:31:47,920
Oh, like sentient.

784
00:31:47,920 --> 00:31:50,720
Well, I mean, if it's a fuck robot, I would hope that it's sentient,

785
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:52,480
or else I'd feel like I'm with a vegetable.

786
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:52,880
Yeah.

787
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:58,560
I want somebody who, after a while, figures out this system that I've set up.

788
00:31:58,560 --> 00:31:59,440
You don't have to worry about that.

789
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:01,360
Third law of robotics is don't harm a human.

790
00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:03,280
Fourth law of robotics, swallow.

791
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:05,680
Yeah, this is true.

792
00:32:05,680 --> 00:32:06,560
We are in our daddy's house.

793
00:32:06,560 --> 00:32:07,760
I'm not making this up.

794
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:08,960
We are in our daddy's house.

795
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:09,520
I know.

796
00:32:09,520 --> 00:32:11,440
Fifth law, anniversary, anything goes.

797
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:15,120
I want to marry a sex robot that has standards.

798
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:16,480
Whisper at the rest of the house.

799
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:17,920
We got to whisper at the rest of this question.

800
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:18,800
I want to.

801
00:32:18,800 --> 00:32:20,080
Nope, I can't do it.

802
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:20,800
You got it, you got it, you got it.

803
00:32:20,800 --> 00:32:21,520
No, I'm not listening.

804
00:32:21,520 --> 00:32:22,480
We're in our daddy's house.

805
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:23,440
We're in daddy's house.

806
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:26,400
I can't go wrong with this, at least first.

807
00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:28,080
Yeah, we got just this question.

808
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:28,720
Just this question.

809
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:33,920
I want to marry a sex robot with standards, like rules, or like, no, I don't do the butt.

810
00:32:33,920 --> 00:32:34,880
That's what I want.

811
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:35,760
They have that program.

812
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:38,800
You think that that would prevent them from going into a killing frenzy?

813
00:32:38,800 --> 00:32:40,640
Well, I mean, they have certain restrictions.

814
00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:46,480
Roger F's me all the time, but at least he gave me boundaries.

815
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:48,240
He programmed those boundaries in it.

816
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:51,440
I dig that, but I don't want to go wild on that.

817
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:53,840
What about, ooh, a robot animal?

818
00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:54,720
Do we already cover this?

819
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:55,360
Can we not do that?

820
00:32:55,360 --> 00:32:56,480
Yeah, we did a robot llama.

821
00:32:56,480 --> 00:32:59,520
With the Beast Wars contingent, I established that that can't be.

822
00:32:59,520 --> 00:33:02,000
But now Travis really wants to explore that space.

823
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:04,580
Yeah.

824
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:08,560
I mean, a dog is man's best friend.

825
00:33:08,560 --> 00:33:12,960
A robot dog is man's, like, brother.

826
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:15,600
And a robot dog with fuck capabilities.

827
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:16,560
Hey, are there any answers?

828
00:33:16,560 --> 00:33:19,120
Did anybody dip in to give it a shot?

829
00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:23,280
Uh, it's Romans 1, 24 through 27.

830
00:33:23,280 --> 00:33:24,400
You fucker.

831
00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:28,400
You're going to try to drop the Bible on this person like they never left

832
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:31,200
traditional morality behind a few puppies ago.

833
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:32,080
Robots one.

834
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:37,680
Everyone, turn your Bibles to the fuck of robots.

835
00:33:38,800 --> 00:33:40,800
It's one chapter, one verse.

836
00:33:40,800 --> 00:33:42,640
It's robots one, one.

837
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:44,640
Don't fuck robots, you weirdo.

838
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:49,600
You know, I'm sure there's stuff in the rest of the Bible about fucking animals, though.

839
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:50,640
Yeah, there's got to be.

840
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:52,320
There's got to be.

841
00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:53,440
You'll find the book of robots.

842
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:55,200
That was in the Dead Sea Scrolls, I believe.

843
00:33:56,560 --> 00:33:57,520
With memory serves.

844
00:33:58,080 --> 00:34:03,040
If you marry an animal, you're a freak into bestiality, e.g. a perv.

845
00:34:03,680 --> 00:34:07,520
And you're harming a living creature, so it's a double dose of perversion.

846
00:34:07,520 --> 00:34:09,840
Are we, like, all right, first of all, stop.

847
00:34:10,720 --> 00:34:11,520
Anybody just might...

848
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:12,560
Like, fail.

849
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:13,200
Stop that.

850
00:34:13,840 --> 00:34:19,920
Listen, you are assuming that what I do to my pet llama is harmful,

851
00:34:19,920 --> 00:34:22,000
and that it's, like, beautiful and natural.

852
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:22,960
Like, you know what?

853
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:23,920
Think of it this way.

854
00:34:23,920 --> 00:34:25,120
Did you guys hear about that law?

855
00:34:26,080 --> 00:34:28,160
Somebody just passed a law, I can't remember which state,

856
00:34:28,160 --> 00:34:29,840
probably one of the more fucked up ones,

857
00:34:29,840 --> 00:34:31,920
that says you can't have sex with an animal.

858
00:34:31,920 --> 00:34:35,200
But they worded it in a way that doesn't exclude human beings,

859
00:34:35,200 --> 00:34:36,480
because we're animals.

860
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:37,600
So they basically made it...

861
00:34:37,600 --> 00:34:38,400
I think it's in Florida.

862
00:34:38,400 --> 00:34:39,840
You can't fuck in Florida anymore.

863
00:34:39,840 --> 00:34:42,320
Like, that's the law, is that you can't fuck in Florida.

864
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:45,040
But that law brings up a good point, because we're animals too.

865
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:48,160
I should be able to fuck whatever I want.

866
00:34:48,160 --> 00:34:51,360
Robots, not animals, not humanoid.

867
00:34:51,360 --> 00:34:55,760
They can be humanoid-shaped, but they can't feel like they're walls,

868
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:58,640
like the walls of their vagina, like it doesn't...

869
00:34:58,640 --> 00:35:00,320
I see, right.

870
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:04,080
It's not moist, is what I'm saying.

871
00:35:05,840 --> 00:35:08,160
You know, usually these things end with big laughs,

872
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:10,480
and then we move on to that, Griffin, you've made it.

873
00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:12,800
Just dropped some science on everybody.

874
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:13,600
I'm sold.

875
00:35:13,600 --> 00:35:15,360
Animals, animals, animals.

876
00:35:15,360 --> 00:35:17,120
Case closed.

877
00:35:17,120 --> 00:35:21,120
I'm interested in dating my brother's girlfriend's sister.

878
00:35:21,120 --> 00:35:24,560
Is it acceptable for brothers to date sisters?

879
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:25,520
If one pair get married,

880
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:27,520
did the other pair have to immediately break up?

881
00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:28,960
Tag team in Texas.

882
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:30,720
I feel like this is one of those multilayered questions

883
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:32,320
where someone's trying to trick us into saying

884
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:33,600
it's okay to have sex with their sister.

885
00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:35,920
If we don't like, incept it and all.

886
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:38,080
Hey, hold on, wait, is your sister an animal?

887
00:35:38,080 --> 00:35:39,360
I think she is.

888
00:35:39,360 --> 00:35:42,640
She's an animal called human, called homo erectus.

889
00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:44,880
Get it.

890
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:45,040
Yeah.

891
00:35:46,160 --> 00:35:48,240
Actually, she's not human, she's a dancer, it says here.

892
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:56,320
Okay, so my brother's girlfriend's sister.

893
00:35:57,680 --> 00:35:58,800
I think it's okay.

894
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:02,480
Isn't that the plot of one of the Brady Bunch movies?

895
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:03,520
All of them hook up with different couples?

896
00:36:03,520 --> 00:36:04,880
Guys, we didn't think about something.

897
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:05,920
Tell me, tell me.

898
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:08,240
Bicentennial Man.

899
00:36:10,640 --> 00:36:13,520
You start out with Robin Williams, pure, whole robot.

900
00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:15,120
By the end, he's a human being.

901
00:36:15,120 --> 00:36:17,760
He's had all of his robot parts replaced with human being parts

902
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:20,400
and he can feel and die and maybe go to heaven.

903
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:23,520
Like real people in heaven, like straight up real people heaven

904
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:25,600
and not, well, robots don't get anything.

905
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:27,200
But what do you think about that?

906
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:30,720
Oh, now we're back to moral ambiguity.

907
00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:31,200
Yeah.

908
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:32,080
Damn it.

909
00:36:32,080 --> 00:36:34,000
Sorry, I didn't mean to interrupt the flow.

910
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:37,360
I would argue that if we eventually made him into Robin Williams,

911
00:36:37,360 --> 00:36:38,320
he's not a person.

912
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:43,920
I think our bigger concern is once you open the floodgate on one of them,

913
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:46,240
you're gonna end up with robots burying animals.

914
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:50,080
If you open Robin Williams' floodgate, you could just get out of the way.

915
00:36:50,080 --> 00:36:51,840
He really isn't a person anymore.

916
00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:53,520
He's a typhoon of juggles.

917
00:36:53,520 --> 00:36:55,440
He is a comedy shadow.

918
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:56,720
He is a walking awkward.

919
00:36:57,600 --> 00:36:58,720
Unpleasant with him right now.

920
00:36:58,720 --> 00:36:59,840
He's negative laughter.

921
00:36:59,840 --> 00:37:03,360
I'm unpleasant on the Paul he has cast over this show.

922
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:05,280
Na-no, na-no.

923
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:07,680
Na-no, no thanks, son of a bitch.

924
00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:09,680
Don't date your sister, you weird.

925
00:37:09,680 --> 00:37:10,720
No, she's saying...

926
00:37:11,360 --> 00:37:12,640
Your sister-in-law?

927
00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:14,400
No, don't do it because if one of you...

928
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:15,760
I don't care about one of you getting married.

929
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:20,880
I care about one of you breaking up because that will take you to the awkward village.

930
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:23,040
How was your Christmas?

931
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:23,520
It was great.

932
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:26,800
There were sword fights because one of us dated and the other ones broke up.

933
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:29,040
Just don't do it.

934
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:29,680
Just don't do it.

935
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:30,400
That was easy.

936
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:31,040
That was easy.

937
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:36,400
Romans 1, 15 through 16 says don't fuck your sister's sister.

938
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:37,760
Sisters, brothers.

939
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:40,800
Don't fuck anyone who is ever on the TV show Sister Sister.

940
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:42,240
That includes Taj Mowry.

941
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:48,560
I recently started to text and talk with an old college friend.

942
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:52,800
It's been five years and we live a few states apart, but things seem to be progressing towards

943
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:53,840
the romantic.

944
00:37:53,840 --> 00:37:59,280
My problem is I've gained a significant amount of weight since college, like a hundo, putting

945
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:01,920
me at six to 300 lbs.

946
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:02,960
Six to 300 lbs?

947
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:06,400
I weigh between six and 300...

948
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:08,800
No, six to 300 lbs.

949
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:12,320
Do I mention this to her or just show up with some extra for her to love?

950
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:13,920
Rotund romancer.

951
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:16,240
Okay, you got to drop that nomenclature.

952
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:20,480
Hey, I've got some branding to go along with this.

953
00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:21,200
That'd be good news.

954
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:21,920
I got branded.

955
00:38:22,640 --> 00:38:24,080
Check out my Lycra jacket.

956
00:38:24,640 --> 00:38:25,840
They're stitched on the back.

957
00:38:25,840 --> 00:38:31,040
I say you need to update your Facebook with a current picture and just let the chips fall

958
00:38:31,040 --> 00:38:31,760
out of their way.

959
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:34,160
With the caption, surprise!

960
00:38:34,160 --> 00:38:34,880
Surprise!

961
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:35,440
This is it.

962
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:36,880
No, I mean, if it's...

963
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:37,760
What does she love?

964
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:38,800
Does she love your heart?

965
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:40,800
Does she love that heart of yours?

966
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:42,320
It happens, guys.

967
00:38:43,520 --> 00:38:48,080
It happens from time to time that a person doesn't love this fame-filled frame.

968
00:38:48,080 --> 00:38:49,040
They love that heart.

969
00:38:50,240 --> 00:38:51,760
That sweet heart of mine.

970
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:53,200
Is that the case that you're going with?

971
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:56,160
Did your heart get fatter? Because if that's the case, it just means you have more love

972
00:38:56,160 --> 00:38:56,960
to give her.

973
00:38:56,960 --> 00:38:58,480
Here's what you should not do.

974
00:38:58,480 --> 00:39:00,720
Absolutely, you cannot mention it.

975
00:39:00,720 --> 00:39:01,200
No.

976
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:03,360
Like, you can't say, hey, listen, just big news.

977
00:39:03,360 --> 00:39:04,080
Just heads up.

978
00:39:04,080 --> 00:39:05,040
I've really bulked up.

979
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:07,520
You can't say that.

980
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:10,560
Like, don't say that, but, you know, put some current pictures up there.

981
00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:13,680
And you know, there's also a good chance she's let herself go a little bit.

982
00:39:13,680 --> 00:39:14,560
How much shame can your frame handle?

983
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:16,800
How much shame is in your frame?

984
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:20,720
Get the shame out your frame and get your frame some fame.

985
00:39:20,720 --> 00:39:24,000
Maid, I want to be about a hundred pounds less.

986
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:25,760
Maid, get down that episode.

987
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:32,480
You can, I mean, you cannot do anything, but there, there may be a look on her face that

988
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:34,480
you aren't going to be able to shake for a while.

989
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:36,080
Oh, but imagine this beautiful moment.

990
00:39:36,080 --> 00:39:38,000
There's a look on her much fatter face.

991
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:38,800
Oh, shit.

992
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:39,840
Oh, no, Shrek.

993
00:39:39,840 --> 00:39:40,880
It's a Shrek ending.

994
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:44,560
We're accidentally in love.

995
00:39:44,560 --> 00:39:46,240
He's got sh-

996
00:39:46,240 --> 00:39:47,760
I want to be a princess.

997
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:49,280
I want to be a princess.

998
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:50,800
I want to be a princess.

999
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:51,840
You are a princess.

1000
00:39:51,840 --> 00:39:52,720
Get over here.

1001
00:39:52,720 --> 00:39:53,760
I have chicken.

1002
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:58,480
Hey, listeners, sorry about us.

1003
00:39:58,480 --> 00:39:59,440
Hey, sorry about us.

1004
00:40:02,080 --> 00:40:03,760
I think that you should just go for it.

1005
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:06,880
And if she turns you down, then she doesn't deserve you.

1006
00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:08,880
Put a current picture up.

1007
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:10,000
If she says, is that current?

1008
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:13,200
Say, no, I'm chunking up and then stop eating.

1009
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:14,240
You got to get slimmer.

1010
00:40:14,240 --> 00:40:14,960
Say, I'm going.

1011
00:40:14,960 --> 00:40:15,920
I'm on my way down.

1012
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:16,480
I promise.

1013
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:17,280
Please don't leave me.

1014
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:18,960
Please, I need you so bad, Debbie.

1015
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:21,360
And if not, maybe, like, you guys will be friends or something.

1016
00:40:23,680 --> 00:40:27,840
The worst five minutes of advice anybody's ever given anyone.

1017
00:40:27,840 --> 00:40:29,520
Somebody go to CJ Maggies with.

1018
00:40:30,560 --> 00:40:32,080
How about one final Yali?

1019
00:40:32,080 --> 00:40:34,240
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1020
00:40:34,240 --> 00:40:36,320
This one was sent in by Galiayali.

1021
00:40:36,320 --> 00:40:37,680
Thank you, Galiayali.

1022
00:40:37,680 --> 00:40:39,760
It's by YaliLancer's user.

1023
00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:40,960
Oh, no.

1024
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:42,880
The picture itself is pretty wonderful.

1025
00:40:42,880 --> 00:40:44,960
The real Marty Janetti.

1026
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:46,960
Marty Janetti.

1027
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:48,960
Except no substance.

1028
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:50,240
Are you guys soaking in that image?

1029
00:40:50,240 --> 00:40:51,040
Oh, man.

1030
00:40:51,040 --> 00:40:52,480
That tiny thumbnail.

1031
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:53,200
It's a wrestler.

1032
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:54,080
He's holding a belt.

1033
00:40:55,120 --> 00:40:57,280
Usually, if I don't know a celebrity, they're a wrestler.

1034
00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:04,400
The real something something asks, how can I convince my girlfriend to dress up like

1035
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:06,320
Violet Beauregard from Willy Wonka?

1036
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:09,200
I am in love with two ladies.

1037
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:09,760
OK.

1038
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:15,040
My sweet little Blueberry, a.k.a. my G friend, and Violet Beauregard from Willy Wonka.

1039
00:41:15,040 --> 00:41:21,840
I think it's so sexy the when Violet inflates into a sphere and would love to see my lady

1040
00:41:21,840 --> 00:41:22,880
do the same.

1041
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:27,840
How can I convince her that this would be both fun and sexy?

1042
00:41:29,040 --> 00:41:33,280
She doesn't realize it yet, but her nickname comes from my number one screen crush.

1043
00:41:35,840 --> 00:41:39,440
I bought the costume last week and I'm fighting up the courage to ask her,

1044
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:40,880
please, any suggestions?

1045
00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:45,440
P.S. Not like in the new crappy Johnny Depp, Charlie and the Charge of Records.

1046
00:41:45,440 --> 00:41:47,520
That CGI looked horrible.

1047
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:48,880
Only Mel Stuart's version.

1048
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:50,320
I can't.

1049
00:41:50,320 --> 00:41:50,960
Oh, God.

1050
00:41:50,960 --> 00:41:54,000
I can't finish unless it's the Mel Stuart's version.

1051
00:41:54,640 --> 00:41:56,480
You look right now, Rashonda.

1052
00:41:56,480 --> 00:42:02,560
You look beautiful, but you look like that shitty Johnny Depp version of Charlie and

1053
00:42:02,560 --> 00:42:03,040
the Charge of Records.

1054
00:42:03,040 --> 00:42:05,680
Honey, I got you this outfit and this bicycle pump.

1055
00:42:05,680 --> 00:42:06,720
Let's go to town.

1056
00:42:06,720 --> 00:42:07,200
Yeah.

1057
00:42:07,200 --> 00:42:10,400
We are going to give you some artificial juice filled dumps.

1058
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:15,840
You ever hear that thing where it's like, if you press this button, you'll get a million

1059
00:42:15,840 --> 00:42:18,240
dollars, but someone in the world will die.

1060
00:42:18,240 --> 00:42:19,200
Do you press a button?

1061
00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:22,800
If I can guarantee it's this guy, I'm just going to start hammering on it.

1062
00:42:24,080 --> 00:42:24,880
Oh, man.

1063
00:42:24,880 --> 00:42:30,160
How stealth do you have to be about your number one screen crush that you have given this

1064
00:42:30,160 --> 00:42:35,360
girl a nickname, which is my little blueberry, and she doesn't know what it's referring to.

1065
00:42:35,360 --> 00:42:37,680
You have to watch this movie, like, on the reg, right?

1066
00:42:37,680 --> 00:42:41,920
Like, and you can tell he's got, like, a half motor, like, when she walks in the room.

1067
00:42:41,920 --> 00:42:43,520
She swells, he swells, baby.

1068
00:42:43,520 --> 00:42:44,720
That's how I do.

1069
00:42:44,720 --> 00:42:45,840
That's gross.

1070
00:42:45,840 --> 00:42:48,720
That is so unpleasant that you would like that so much.

1071
00:42:48,720 --> 00:42:53,920
If you're going to get, if you're going to jerk it to anything in that movie, why not

1072
00:42:53,920 --> 00:42:58,560
a Goose's Gloop getting sucked up in that chocolate pond, that chocolate tube?

1073
00:42:58,560 --> 00:43:02,640
I feel like, I feel like we've just found a really great psychological test.

1074
00:43:02,640 --> 00:43:08,320
There's like, if you had to jerk it to one scene in Willy Wonka, and your answer means

1075
00:43:08,320 --> 00:43:09,280
something.

1076
00:43:09,280 --> 00:43:13,760
How about if you jerked to any second about that movie, which is primarily about, primarily

1077
00:43:13,760 --> 00:43:15,120
about murdering kids?

1078
00:43:16,720 --> 00:43:20,400
Boy, there is a, you know what, as angry as I was about this guy, there is a much more

1079
00:43:20,400 --> 00:43:24,240
unpleasant gentleman whose fetish is a little boy stuck in a chocolate tube.

1080
00:43:24,240 --> 00:43:24,480
Yeah.

1081
00:43:24,480 --> 00:43:25,120
Isn't it?

1082
00:43:25,120 --> 00:43:28,480
I mean, there's that, you don't have to lay it out.

1083
00:43:28,480 --> 00:43:33,120
The parts of your brain of fear and arousal are right next to each other is anything scarier

1084
00:43:33,120 --> 00:43:38,560
than that, the look on that fucking kid's face when he's surrounded by plastic and tiny

1085
00:43:38,560 --> 00:43:40,400
orange men and sweet chocolate.

1086
00:43:40,400 --> 00:43:42,640
It's like, it's heaven and hell, baby.

1087
00:43:42,640 --> 00:43:44,560
He knows, he knows death is around the corner.

1088
00:43:44,560 --> 00:43:46,880
What about the girl that gets thrown in the incinerator?

1089
00:43:46,880 --> 00:43:47,440
Yeah.

1090
00:43:47,440 --> 00:43:48,960
That movie's terrifying.

1091
00:43:48,960 --> 00:43:51,600
Why, why am I so erect then?

1092
00:43:51,600 --> 00:43:53,520
Why am I, oh, that was a bad-

1093
00:43:53,520 --> 00:43:56,880
There's no earthly way of knowing why I have this huge boner.

1094
00:43:56,880 --> 00:43:57,680
That was a bad-

1095
00:43:57,680 --> 00:43:58,720
Well, no, no, no.

1096
00:43:58,720 --> 00:44:01,680
There is no earthly way of knowing why my boner is still growing.

1097
00:44:04,720 --> 00:44:07,280
But the bulge is surely showing.

1098
00:44:07,280 --> 00:44:08,160
Is it shrinking?

1099
00:44:08,160 --> 00:44:08,880
Is it blowing?

1100
00:44:09,520 --> 00:44:11,200
And the semen now is flowing.

1101
00:44:11,200 --> 00:44:30,880
So I want to hear Griffin's very last question.

1102
00:44:30,880 --> 00:44:35,280
But first, I wanted to say, well, we have a live show.

1103
00:44:35,280 --> 00:44:36,720
It's going to be June 12th.

1104
00:44:36,720 --> 00:44:39,200
We have a handful of tickets left.

1105
00:44:39,200 --> 00:44:42,480
And I'm not saying that they say it to try to encourage people to buy.

1106
00:44:42,480 --> 00:44:44,320
We literally have 10 seats left.

1107
00:44:44,320 --> 00:44:47,360
We have those on Sunday night, and the show's going up on Monday morning.

1108
00:44:47,360 --> 00:44:49,280
So no guarantees.

1109
00:44:49,280 --> 00:44:52,240
And hopefully, we've talked about it on Twitter and our Facebook as much as we can.

1110
00:44:52,240 --> 00:44:53,040
And on our website.

1111
00:44:53,040 --> 00:44:53,840
And our website.

1112
00:44:53,840 --> 00:44:56,080
Yeah, it's all on MaximumFun.org.

1113
00:44:56,080 --> 00:44:58,160
So if you don't get tickets, we're sorry.

1114
00:44:58,160 --> 00:44:59,680
We're going to keep doing these live shows.

1115
00:44:59,680 --> 00:45:01,440
So this isn't the last chance.

1116
00:45:01,440 --> 00:45:07,280
And this one's, hopefully we'll be able to, we're all close enough to Cincinnati.

1117
00:45:07,280 --> 00:45:09,920
Maybe we can do this again at some point if you miss out on the show.

1118
00:45:09,920 --> 00:45:12,000
Because the response has been so awesome for you guys.

1119
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:12,720
Thank you so much, guys.

1120
00:45:12,720 --> 00:45:13,360
We really appreciate it.

1121
00:45:13,360 --> 00:45:14,160
Christ.

1122
00:45:14,160 --> 00:45:16,000
And we're still shopping for opening acts.

1123
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:17,440
We've got a few really good leads.

1124
00:45:17,440 --> 00:45:22,480
But if you live in Cincinnati or know a really great comic or band or anything like that

1125
00:45:22,480 --> 00:45:25,520
in Cincinnati, at this point, I'm really excited about Magician.

1126
00:45:26,160 --> 00:45:27,840
It's something I'm leaning towards.

1127
00:45:27,840 --> 00:45:30,560
I'm getting some fight from the brothers.

1128
00:45:32,080 --> 00:45:33,760
I would take a Magician at this point.

1129
00:45:33,760 --> 00:45:34,960
Can we get a ball pit?

1130
00:45:34,960 --> 00:45:36,640
You mean just like a half hour ball pit?

1131
00:45:36,640 --> 00:45:39,680
Like I don't, like yeah, like we just put the ball pit up there and it's just like, go nuts.

1132
00:45:39,680 --> 00:45:42,160
We originally said that we could have another podcast open for us.

1133
00:45:42,160 --> 00:45:46,880
And we did have a couple of suggestions, but we were worried that they could be better than ours.

1134
00:45:46,880 --> 00:45:47,680
And we can't have that.

1135
00:45:47,680 --> 00:45:50,720
So we've got to have somebody who's not a podcast now.

1136
00:45:50,720 --> 00:45:51,280
We've decided.

1137
00:45:51,280 --> 00:45:52,960
Because that's the kind of insecurity we're talking about here.

1138
00:45:52,960 --> 00:45:56,800
And if you're already going to be in town, I'll give you your coming in town Cincinnati,

1139
00:45:56,800 --> 00:46:00,560
might I suggest checking out complete works of William Shakespeare Bridge at the Cincinnati

1140
00:46:00,560 --> 00:46:01,520
Shakespeare Company.

1141
00:46:01,520 --> 00:46:06,400
Who, they are wonderfully hosting our show.

1142
00:46:06,400 --> 00:46:09,520
So if you want to check that out in the afternoon and then come see our show at night,

1143
00:46:09,520 --> 00:46:10,880
I highly recommend it.

1144
00:46:10,880 --> 00:46:12,400
They act really fucking good.

1145
00:46:12,400 --> 00:46:13,200
They act so good.

1146
00:46:13,200 --> 00:46:14,480
All of them act really good.

1147
00:46:15,280 --> 00:46:17,200
So thank you guys.

1148
00:46:17,200 --> 00:46:23,200
We love it when people tweet on Twitter about our show and use the NBNBAM hashtag.

1149
00:46:23,200 --> 00:46:26,160
So we make sure to see it.

1150
00:46:26,160 --> 00:46:31,760
Rickman is a relatively new convert, I think.

1151
00:46:31,760 --> 00:46:34,480
He was tweeting up a storm.

1152
00:46:36,800 --> 00:46:37,200
Let's see.

1153
00:46:37,200 --> 00:46:38,640
Our buddy Rhymeswag.

1154
00:46:38,640 --> 00:46:40,880
He's a relatively new tweeter.

1155
00:46:40,880 --> 00:46:43,040
I haven't seen him popping up too much.

1156
00:46:43,040 --> 00:46:45,360
I do like IP and butts, which is a good.

1157
00:46:46,640 --> 00:46:47,200
Oh, wait, wait.

1158
00:46:47,200 --> 00:46:47,600
I love this.

1159
00:46:47,600 --> 00:46:48,320
Go back down.

1160
00:46:48,320 --> 00:46:49,360
This guy's my favorite.

1161
00:46:49,360 --> 00:46:51,920
Onk Monk says at the NBNBAM.

1162
00:46:51,920 --> 00:46:52,480
Fuck you.

1163
00:46:53,840 --> 00:46:54,560
Got us.

1164
00:46:54,560 --> 00:46:55,120
Got us.

1165
00:46:55,120 --> 00:46:56,320
Nailed us again.

1166
00:46:56,960 --> 00:47:02,480
I want to hand out a special congratulations to my friend Sabrina and Chris.

1167
00:47:02,480 --> 00:47:03,920
They just had a baby.

1168
00:47:03,920 --> 00:47:08,240
And I'm going to go ahead and name it Travis McElroy's pick for my brother, my brother,

1169
00:47:08,240 --> 00:47:09,360
and me baby of the year.

1170
00:47:09,360 --> 00:47:12,000
The most pinchable baby of 2000 and heaven.

1171
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:15,920
So let's give that up to Benjamin Prometheus Stoker.

1172
00:47:15,920 --> 00:47:16,720
Real name.

1173
00:47:16,720 --> 00:47:18,560
The sweetest baby.

1174
00:47:18,560 --> 00:47:19,360
What a great baby.

1175
00:47:19,920 --> 00:47:22,320
And thanks to our buddy Cole Ross.

1176
00:47:22,320 --> 00:47:23,680
That's Cole with a K.

1177
00:47:23,680 --> 00:47:30,160
He hosts and produces stand under the don't treat and riddle me this.

1178
00:47:30,160 --> 00:47:32,480
And is also a co-host of those damn Ross kids.

1179
00:47:32,480 --> 00:47:34,160
And he is in Cincinnati.

1180
00:47:34,160 --> 00:47:37,200
So we'll be able to feel his vibes emanating through the air.

1181
00:47:37,200 --> 00:47:38,000
I feel him here.

1182
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:39,440
I feel him in Ironton.

1183
00:47:39,440 --> 00:47:40,800
So hi to everybody.

1184
00:47:40,800 --> 00:47:41,920
DuckLips 513.

1185
00:47:41,920 --> 00:47:42,880
Everybody tweeting about the show.

1186
00:47:42,880 --> 00:47:43,680
We really appreciate it.

1187
00:47:44,720 --> 00:47:49,760
Thanks to our daddy and the Carol for just just ram jamming us with pasta.

1188
00:47:49,760 --> 00:47:50,640
So much pasta.

1189
00:47:50,640 --> 00:47:52,560
Gonna go eat some strawberry pie too.

1190
00:47:52,560 --> 00:47:53,200
Oh, yeah.

1191
00:47:53,200 --> 00:47:54,080
Don't mind if I do.

1192
00:47:54,640 --> 00:47:56,160
So this has been Pasta Fest.

1193
00:47:56,160 --> 00:47:57,920
Thank you for being a part of it.

1194
00:47:58,480 --> 00:48:01,200
Thank you for tuning in next week for Rasta Fest.

1195
00:48:01,200 --> 00:48:03,760
Every year we're going to do Pasta Fest in May.

1196
00:48:03,760 --> 00:48:05,920
Rasta Fest in late May or late June.

1197
00:48:07,920 --> 00:48:11,120
And Griffin right now is going to hit you, the listening audience,

1198
00:48:11,120 --> 00:48:12,720
with our very last question of the week.

1199
00:48:14,560 --> 00:48:15,840
Oh, one more thing.

1200
00:48:15,840 --> 00:48:21,840
If you'd like to introduce the show to somebody, we've got a brand new way of doing it.

1201
00:48:21,840 --> 00:48:23,680
It's the MBMBAM sampler.

1202
00:48:24,560 --> 00:48:30,320
That is located at bit.ly forward slash it's MBMBAM.

1203
00:48:30,320 --> 00:48:33,120
So bit.ly forward slash it's MBMBAM.

1204
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:37,520
So if you want to tweet about the show to be listened to it,

1205
00:48:37,520 --> 00:48:41,760
please use that link and just say, like, hey, I think you'd like this jerk.

1206
00:48:41,760 --> 00:48:42,880
It's about 12 minutes.

1207
00:48:42,880 --> 00:48:46,080
Some of our classic bits.

1208
00:48:46,880 --> 00:48:48,320
If this is your first time listening,

1209
00:48:48,320 --> 00:48:51,120
if you one of the people introduces that, make sure to check out our website,

1210
00:48:51,120 --> 00:48:54,240
www.mbmbam.com.

1211
00:48:54,880 --> 00:48:56,080
Let's bury this bitch.

1212
00:48:57,200 --> 00:48:57,840
Sink it.

1213
00:48:57,840 --> 00:49:00,080
Final question is sent in by Asumane Mariko.

1214
00:49:00,080 --> 00:49:01,600
Thank you, Asumane Mariko.

1215
00:49:02,240 --> 00:49:05,280
It's by Yahoo Answers user, Pumpertek, who asks,

1216
00:49:06,080 --> 00:49:07,040
I'm bored.

1217
00:49:07,040 --> 00:49:08,400
What do you do for fun?

1218
00:49:08,400 --> 00:49:09,840
It is raining out also.

1219
00:49:09,840 --> 00:49:10,960
And I'm an old man.

1220
00:49:14,400 --> 00:49:15,440
I'm Justin McElroy.

1221
00:49:15,440 --> 00:49:16,400
