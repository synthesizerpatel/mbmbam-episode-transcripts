1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:30,800
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:50,160
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome my brother, my brother, me, an advice show for the modern era.

6
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:57,360
I'm your super smooth, totally great host with the best pipes in the biz, Justin McElroy,

7
00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:03,280
oldest brother. I'm your middle brother, Travis McElroy. I'm your sweet baby, Griffin. Justin,

8
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:10,240
I can hear your individual vocal cords slapping against each other like two wet hams,

9
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:18,960
just slapping away. Yeah, over the Christmas break, I took a lot of classes in how to get

10
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:26,800
that deep, rich sound that all the radio babes crave. Was that taught by the Wolfman on WAMX?

11
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:37,520
It's taught by Dr. Wolfs. He's the wolfiest guy that is around. Why do you sound the way that you

12
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:43,280
do? Well, I've got a great, I got a new microphone for Christmas. It's a grownup microphone that's

13
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:49,280
plugged into like a mixing board that gives me full control over the sound. So if I want to go

14
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:54,400
like full high on the EQ, let me check the EQ. It sounds like you're coming from the future.

15
00:01:54,400 --> 00:02:00,800
Sure. I am, Travis, and in the future, I have full control over the EQ. Do you make it sound

16
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:05,520
like you're in a box? What? Make it sound like you're in a box. Make it sound like I'm in a box.

17
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:09,680
Okay, the one thing I'm going to tell you is I forgot to monitor myself, so I don't know what

18
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:14,320
any of this sounds like. Well, now I have more like an old-timey radio. Now I'm over here.

19
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:20,080
Well, you just cut it out entirely. Now you've disappeared. Now I'm over here in your left ear.

20
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:24,160
Okay, so don't go back to the right ear because there's nothing good for us.

21
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:28,480
I'm going to get like a nice healthy blend here of all three of my different voices.

22
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:31,200
Can you put on like an old-timey prospector filter?

23
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:37,200
Yeah, hold on one second. All right, Griff, when you're editing this,

24
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:40,400
just make it sound like I'm an old-timey prospector. Yeah, I should be able to do

25
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:46,560
that in the free basic version of Audacity that I have. Probably has that capability.

26
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:50,080
This is only the middle. What's in the middle? What does this sound like?

27
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:56,880
Nothing good. You sound like a Tally Hall record. Yeah. This is great. So you have a stude now.

28
00:02:56,880 --> 00:02:59,760
Can you welcome people into your office and say, welcome to the stude?

29
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:03,360
Welcome to the stude. Here's my four-channel mixing board.

30
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:06,640
You are not going to sound great, I bet, for the rest of the podcast because of this groove.

31
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:14,400
No, I think it'll sound really good because I've got a good balance right now. I am going to take

32
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:21,040
that bass up a little bit because it is like testosterone on a dial. Yeah, you're basically

33
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:27,280
pushing the end of your penis outwards. You're pushing it. You're stretching my prongs.

34
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:32,160
Stretching the flesh, as it were. That's his industry terms.

35
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:37,120
Did you guys introduce yourselves and shit? Yeah, you were so busy with your knobs and

36
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:41,840
your doodads. God, I was really busy with them. Is it going to be bad that we don't have doodads

37
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:48,080
and what's its galore? Yeah. Comparatively, you will sound like bug kings. You'll sound like

38
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:59,440
the omnipotent rulers of some sort of bug kingdom. Okay. I am drinking cucumber lime Gatorade.

39
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:05,360
Whoa. I bought it because it was green and green beverages are usually a surefire hit.

40
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:10,000
Just asked Dr. Mountain Dew. Have you guys had Dr. Mountain Dew?

41
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:16,480
Mm-hmm. That's the big K version of Mountain Dew. I can't believe it's not copyright infringement.

42
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:21,760
Oh, God. This tastes like fresh squeezed juice, but without all of the shit inside of it that's

43
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:26,160
supposed to be good for you. It tastes like the ghost of fresh squeezed juice. Yeah. It's like if

44
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:30,800
you put juice in a centrifuge, but I'm talking like that juice that you make in a juicer with

45
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:37,040
kale and stuff. By the way, thanks for the juicer, Justin. You can tell I'm getting deep into it.

46
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:41,120
You're really getting deep into it because you went to the store and bought cucumber Gatorade.

47
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:46,400
Can't make it my own. What do you juice to get electrolytes? A light bulb? Electricity?

48
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:50,800
Bigger electrolytes. Okay. But then you have to deal with the rind.

49
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:57,520
I think you just put batteries in there. Yeah. That'll work. Let's do some... Let's do advice.

50
00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:02,640
Let's do advice. I'm on a new health kick. Oh, so let's talk about that instead. Sorry.

51
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:07,680
Is that good? It's just, I've been mixing oatmeal into pretty much everything.

52
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:14,800
Well, that'll do it. You get full real fast. You get full so fast. That sounds like something you

53
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:22,000
would do in the depression. Yeah. You thin out your turnips with some oatmeal. It's World War

54
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:31,760
II rationing all over again. Those are all olives. If you slop some oatmeal onto some ribs and do a

55
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:38,080
dry rub, it makes the ribs healthier for your tummy and heart. I mixed them into some yogurt

56
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:44,320
with some Craisins today and it was very filling and not a food. Now, Justin, I want you to be

57
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:50,640
honest. When you say you got into a health kick of mixing oatmeal into stuff, do you mean you put

58
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:58,640
some in your yogurt this morning and that was it? No, I don't think so. Okay. Yes. Correct. That is

59
00:05:58,640 --> 00:06:04,800
correct. I've been on this health. I've tried everything. I've tried everything until I lose

60
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:10,240
weight. Have you tried eating healthy food and working out? That's my new thing. That's my new

61
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:14,320
jam that I'm going to- Because I feel like when you say you tried everything, you mean just eating

62
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:20,880
bacon. His last ditch effort. All hope was lost with nothing left to lose. Why didn't you stick

63
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:30,000
with ketosis? You looked so jaundiced when you were on that ketosis. You had such a healthy yellow glow.

64
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:34,160
Especially around your neck when it was a darker orange. Oh, God, you looked amazing.

65
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:44,240
I thought about it, Griffin. I realized that even though I felt terrible and was dying, I thought,

66
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:49,440
someday I want to be able to look at my kid in the eye and when they look back at me,

67
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:55,760
I don't want them to see two weird lemons staring back at them. I'm just going to go ahead and try

68
00:06:55,760 --> 00:07:00,400
to eat a vegetable or two. You don't have resilience. I think it was Kate Moss who said,

69
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:06,240
nothing tastes as good as jaundiced looks. Right. I think that was correct. All right. Let's actually

70
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:10,480
help some people. Travis, I don't like the font you used in the email this week. I just wanted to-

71
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:15,440
Well, blame it on my new iPad mini, Justin. Did you arrange it on your iPad mini? I did.

72
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:21,040
This does not have the sexy sex appeal that you expect from an eye product. My boyfriend

73
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:24,640
and I have been dating for almost three years. We both see ourselves in it for the long haul.

74
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:29,280
But when we talk about the future, I want to live in a beautiful apartment in the city

75
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:33,840
and he wants to live off the grid in a cabin in the woods. While I support being self-sustaining,

76
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:39,600
I still want all the cushy amenities of life. Is there a compromise here? What would you do?

77
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:45,520
What would you do? Vexed in Vancouver. So you want the stores. He wants the chores.

78
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:51,600
And the bores, the wild bores. He wants fresh air. You want Times Square.

79
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:56,080
He wants Arnold the pig and you want to eat Arnold the pig. I didn't watch. I never saw

80
00:07:56,080 --> 00:08:00,960
that show. Did not see Green Acres myself. No, never. You got a Green Acres scenario going on

81
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:07,120
here. I feel like the solution is easy. You just live off the grid in a cabin in the city.

82
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:13,760
I'm trying to find your apartment and I got it. I'm lost. I'm adjacent to where you said it would

83
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:18,560
be, but I don't see anything here. I feel like my mind has been clouded

84
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:22,240
and I cannot see it. If only I could see through the haze.

85
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:28,800
You're saying you want some sort of hologram magic invisistial that you want to wrap around.

86
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:33,200
Well, mine was more of a reference to the hit movie, The Shadows, starring Alec Baldwin.

87
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:41,440
No, just me? No, just you. Got it. Okay. Eddie Albert was, of course,

88
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:45,120
the star of Green Acres and I don't have a point.

89
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:51,600
Fuck. I think anytime someone says the phrase,

90
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:56,800
I want to live off the grid, it's a little bit weird to me to begin with.

91
00:08:56,800 --> 00:09:00,400
Everybody wants to vacation off the grid. Well, yeah, but you don't want to live off

92
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:05,840
the grid. Well, I guess if you don't want to impact this relationship that you treasure so much,

93
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:10,000
which by the way, three years and no ring on it, sweetie.

94
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:14,400
Lock it down. Lock it in and up.

95
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:20,640
Wear a locket. Wear a locket. I think you got to give in and I think you acquiesce and I think you

96
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:24,560
live off the grid for like two weeks and he's like, this fucking sucks. Can we please-

97
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:26,880
Keep your apartment, okay? Let's just put it that way.

98
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:30,880
I just pooped outside for the 28th time. You want to go?

99
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:33,920
Why don't you just like have an off the grid vacation home?

100
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:38,400
Yeah. See, that seems like rational to me. Get it like a split,

101
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:42,400
a time splitter with a bunch of other young professionals.

102
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:49,600
Or get split level, live half the home on the grid and the other half is off the grid.

103
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:53,520
Hey, should we go downstairs, have some coffee? I don't have a downstairs.

104
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:56,800
I don't know what you're talking about. Please don't look at that door.

105
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:00,400
Door, it's covered in ivy. There's no downstairs.

106
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:02,880
I think when these people say- That's Fred Penner's place.

107
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:06,320
You guys understand that when these people say off the grid, they're talking about like

108
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:10,320
no power and internet, not that they live in a fucking invisible house, right?

109
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:13,040
Because you guys know that that's not a goddamn thing that people can do,

110
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:15,120
even when they're in the woods. Hey Griffin,

111
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:20,240
spoiler alert, it sounds a good god deal more plausible than living without electricity and

112
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:27,920
plumbing, okay? For me, I would much rather try to find a fantasy castle. You would have better odds

113
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:38,480
of finding me in a mystical, some sort of illusory, time traveling magic castle than find me

114
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:44,560
voluntarily without the creature comfort to which I've become accustomed.

115
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:48,640
I feel like the next time your boyfriend brings it up, I think your response should be,

116
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:54,560
oh so you want to break up because I guarantee living together for a solid month with nothing

117
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:59,280
else to do but stare at each other until the sun goes down at six o'clock and then go to sleep,

118
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:01,840
we'll kill each other. Yeah, I just saw Lincoln

119
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:08,320
and that's basically what happened to the old Abe and Mary. So he's just like,

120
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:12,000
even when he was the president, he's still living in a goddamn ramshackle shack.

121
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:16,480
And all they can do is they can look at each other and like count how many of their sons are dead.

122
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:21,840
So like they just lost their goddamned minds. Well, she more than him. She literally did.

123
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:28,400
Well, he more literally lost his mind, but she, yeah, she done goofed mentally. And I think it

124
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:33,920
really is just because you, it's just the stare down and you just, you lose it. You can't go,

125
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:37,840
you gotta stay in the city. That's what internet, that's what iPad and iPhone is for. This is like

126
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:41,360
another face that you can look at for a while. Just some other face.

127
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:49,040
A palette cleanser from Mary Lincoln. And Mary Lincoln in the real was not a beautiful woman.

128
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:54,720
Yeah, not like Sally Fields. Nice try, Stevo. Nice try, Stevo Spielberg. I see through your

129
00:11:54,720 --> 00:12:01,680
ruse. Here's a Mary Lincoln you'll want to fuck. Nice try. Nice try.

130
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:12,480
Nice try. First he tries to, first he tries to make Val Kilmer into Moses. And now this.

131
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:13,520
You guys see Prince of Egypt?

132
00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:15,440
We're all on the same level.

133
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:17,280
Is this the same Skype call?

134
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:17,760
I guess.

135
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:28,320
You don't want to do this. I'm so rare. I'm all for finding balance in relationships, but I find

136
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:35,280
uh, living off the grid so personally offensive that I don't think I can, I can endorse compromise

137
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:35,680
here.

138
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:39,520
I feel like it would be the kind of thing if my significant other brought up, I would just laugh

139
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:42,400
and then be horrified when I realized they weren't joking.

140
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:45,840
Yeah, it would be like the breakest of deal breakers.

141
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:50,080
Could you just get a house with a big backyard and in that big backyard you can do projects

142
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:53,280
and build himself a little hut. He can make, he can make it.

143
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:55,600
Or like a house with a bomb shelter.

144
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:59,760
Yeah, or a doomsday prepper shelter, which I guess is the same thing.

145
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:01,520
Maybe like a farm property.

146
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:01,920
Yep.

147
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:05,360
So where you like, you could have a nice farm house with all the modern amenities

148
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:09,760
and he could, although you know what, like even that's not, she wants that big city life.

149
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:10,000
Yeah.

150
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:12,000
I don't think it's going to work.

151
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:15,200
I don't think it's going to work either. I'm sorry. This probably isn't the advice you were

152
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:17,280
looking for, but it's over between the two of you.

153
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:17,920
Sorry guys.

154
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:22,880
We actually are just going to go ahead and officially proclaim you guys broken up.

155
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:23,120
Yeah.

156
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:24,880
He had a good run.

157
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:26,480
I don't know. Maybe when you-

158
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:28,960
He was apparently wishing the whole time that no one could find him.

159
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:33,120
He's playing his own game of hide and seek with the world.

160
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:36,640
He knows that once he's on the grid, like you're on it.

161
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:40,160
I watch Homeland. Okay. You're on it. They can find you.

162
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:43,280
Can I read a Yahoo?

163
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:44,000
Please.

164
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:48,000
This Yahoo answer was sent in by Ira Ray. Thanks Ira.

165
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,840
It's by Yahoo answers user no name.

166
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:51,040
Sorry.

167
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:54,240
Sorry. Are you Ira Ray?

168
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:54,560
Thank you.

169
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:55,200
Who wants to know?

170
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:56,000
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.

171
00:13:56,560 --> 00:14:00,960
No name asks, is it acceptable to wear a Snuggie in church?

172
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:05,440
Have you ever seen anyone wearing a Snuggie in church?

173
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:06,880
Do you wear one?

174
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:11,200
If I went to church, I think it would be nice to snuggle up in the pew with your Snuggie in Bible.

175
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:13,600
They should make them in religious theme prints for that purpose.

176
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:17,120
I know somebody who wears a Snuggie in church.

177
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:17,520
Who's that?

178
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:19,920
Maybe, maybe he's called the Pope.

179
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:25,520
Pope's been wearing a Snuggie for all of his papal days and no one's called him out on it yet.

180
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:30,480
He's infallible and he's unsnugglable. He's so comfortable.

181
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:36,080
I think, I think when you're wearing a Snuggie, you are literally the snuggliest you could ever be.

182
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:40,880
But what if, what if they made a, I just had a great idea to like facilitate snuggling.

183
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:45,680
What if you had a Snuggie, but it ran around, it went around your entire body and you could even

184
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:50,080
get fun with it and like make it like the shape of an animal.

185
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:53,440
Wait, don't Snuggies already go around your entire body?

186
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:58,720
No, no, your hands and your face and instead of a face, you would have like a wolf's, like a sexy wolf face.

187
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:00,000
You're talking about a furry.

188
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:05,360
No, I think what he's suggesting is like a full body animal costume.

189
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:08,560
No, no, I'm talking about a full body Snuggie suit with animal, with animal skin.

190
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:10,880
Okay, so you dress up as an animal and go to church.

191
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:11,600
Basically.

192
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:12,960
That's basically what I'm saying.

193
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:13,760
That's basically it.

194
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:14,240
Okay.

195
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:23,200
We have, listen, we have come out in full support of basically every imaginable type of subgroup of people ever.

196
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:23,680
Right.

197
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:28,800
So I'm not knocking, I'm not knocking furries, I swear to you, but is there a furry church?

198
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:35,520
But okay, because here's my point, I love steampunk, I don't want to see, you know,

199
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:43,680
Dr. Laserbeam rolling up to church with his girlfriend and her parasol and Dr. Laserbeam

200
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:45,680
talking about hazel, you know what I mean?

201
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:47,200
Like time and place, people.

202
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:50,400
I'm changing churches unless you make zeppelin parking.

203
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:54,800
Where am I supposed to leave it?

204
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:56,240
It's a giant balloon.

205
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:59,680
This is my steam powered praying machine.

206
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:04,240
You put your wish into this canister.

207
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:09,280
I would shoot you, sir, if I wasn't out of water.

208
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:16,320
Travis, where does your zealotry end if I can't steampunk in church?

209
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:17,280
Can I wear shorts?

210
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:19,520
Am I allowed to wear shorts to your church?

211
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:24,880
You know, it's funny you asked that, but it gave me really strong shivers to picture it.

212
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:25,120
Yeah.

213
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:31,680
Not in my church, maybe some of those looser northern Baptist church.

214
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:33,120
Yeah, I guess I didn't think about that.

215
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:36,240
But in my church, full suits of armor.

216
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:38,320
Is there a furry church?

217
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:39,680
We didn't answer the question.

218
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:42,800
I guess we have to answer the first answer the question if there's a furry heaven in hell.

219
00:16:43,760 --> 00:16:44,320
Well, yes.

220
00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:47,920
It's in a regular heaven in hell.

221
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:49,040
I guess that's true.

222
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:50,960
I want to go to furry church now.

223
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:54,480
I want to go furry heaven, but let's let's get back to Snuggies

224
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:57,600
because I feel like we've made Justin uncomfortable.

225
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:58,640
I think Justin's left.

226
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:01,520
I think Justin might have switched the nozzle.

227
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:03,360
He might have flipped the flanger.

228
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:04,480
Oh, I'm still here.

229
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:06,160
What happened?

230
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:09,120
My cat took a dump in here and I'm dying.

231
00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:19,680
I'm trying to like, listen to this goof and pick back up on the goof.

232
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:22,160
And like, I'm trying to also light a sensei.

233
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:25,280
Now, this is important.

234
00:17:25,840 --> 00:17:30,400
Is it the cat that you have that is approximately three apples long

235
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:35,760
or is it the 600 pound sea cow with furry legs?

236
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:38,880
Is it Fatty Catty or is it Nervous Nelly?

237
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:41,040
I'm going to say it's the skinny one because they got it.

238
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:42,720
It was like a stealth mesh.

239
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:48,320
They got in and out and I didn't I didn't get them until I started getting in my old factories.

240
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:49,200
Oh, God.

241
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:52,560
It's so dirty in here.

242
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:54,080
I have to find a candle.

243
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:55,040
Say something funny.

244
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:00,880
Oh, Christ.

245
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:05,040
I mean, everybody, everybody who in their choir robes,

246
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:09,520
which I'm assuming is at this church because if you if your choir is not wearing robes,

247
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:10,800
what do you even do in there?

248
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:13,440
Jesus can't hear the singing if they're not wearing robes.

249
00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:18,240
I sprayed some Old Spice Fiji body spray.

250
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:19,760
Oh, it's getting a little better.

251
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:21,600
Oh, no, it's getting worse.

252
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:24,080
They're blending.

253
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:24,400
Stop.

254
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:25,680
They're blending.

255
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:28,240
Stop doing aerosol alchemy.

256
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:29,040
Can you not?

257
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:35,600
Oh, it's like physical therapists and cat food and I hate it.

258
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:37,920
Um, like Jim, bro.

259
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:39,360
Let's do the next question.

260
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:39,760
OK.

261
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:41,280
Oh, I got a question.

262
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:44,800
How do you get the cat poopy smell out of your office when you try to do comedy?

263
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:46,080
This is a really good idea.

264
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:49,200
The room in your house that you work out of and spend most of your time.

265
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:50,880
Maybe don't let your animals shit.

266
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:54,560
Maybe don't put up like shit receptacle for any living being in it.

267
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:57,840
You have full control over where that shit occurs.

268
00:18:57,840 --> 00:19:01,520
It all started because I had to keep the little one locked in here

269
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:03,120
to keep her separate from the big one.

270
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:06,720
So I put the dookie box in here and then I thought,

271
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:10,080
but then I realized I should move it out of here because I'm in here.

272
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:11,840
Yeah, but then I'm so worried.

273
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:15,680
He's like the cat like Amelia will be like, well, I always stay here before.

274
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:17,040
Sorry.

275
00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:18,480
Didn't have that magic dirt.

276
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:21,600
I'm a cat.

277
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:24,480
Come on, Hemingway.

278
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:25,680
You're my favorite sensei.

279
00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:28,560
Don't let me down now.

280
00:19:28,560 --> 00:19:34,160
Let the smooth blend of sandalwood and fucking cherries wash over me

281
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:35,120
and save me from this.

282
00:19:35,680 --> 00:19:38,560
I don't think that's what Hemingway smelled like.

283
00:19:38,560 --> 00:19:40,720
I'm trying so hard, Justin.

284
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:46,240
Hemingway probably smelled like probably pipe smoke and boner cream.

285
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:47,680
Save me, Papa.

286
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:50,160
I'm gonna light a pipe.

287
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:51,120
That's a good idea.

288
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:51,760
Hey, brothers.

289
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:52,800
Should I?

290
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:54,880
Hey, brothers.

291
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:57,520
Should I eat mashed potatoes with a fork or a spoon?

292
00:19:58,320 --> 00:19:59,760
That's from mashed in Kentucky.

293
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:01,760
With a fork.

294
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:02,800
With a fork, right?

295
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:04,000
I mean, that's the proper.

296
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:10,800
I feel like if you eat them with a spoon, you're that's that's like the snuggie of eating.

297
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:11,920
That's a good joy.

298
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:13,120
It's like giving up.

299
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:16,720
You're giving up like you're not eating it like a gentleman.

300
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:17,200
Hey, I don't know.

301
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:22,000
There's something about spoon that says like I need to get this in me as fast as possible.

302
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:25,120
And I also don't have the coordination to stab something.

303
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:26,080
Right, right.

304
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:28,880
Just a real quick follow up question.

305
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:30,960
Did you even watch Kony 2012?

306
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:32,480
Mashed in Kentucky.

307
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:36,640
Is this really the most fucking pressing?

308
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:41,760
We are the goddamn wizards of Oz and you come to us with your one wish.

309
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:43,360
You come to us.

310
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:46,480
You've been blessed to have us answer your one riddle.

311
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:47,920
And this is it.

312
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:49,520
This is what you landed on.

313
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:54,000
Don't you guys wish you could have been with Kony on New Year's Eve?

314
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:58,880
Because, you know, he had to be like five, four, three, two.

315
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:01,600
Yeah, not this year.

316
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:02,560
Not this year.

317
00:21:02,560 --> 00:21:04,160
Trust fund babies.

318
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:05,680
He can't come get Kony now.

319
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:09,680
Who's going to pick up Kony 2013?

320
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:10,560
No one.

321
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:15,680
He had a whole year named after him to tribute like just to catching Kony.

322
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:17,680
That's the one thing we had to do this year.

323
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:20,000
He's out and he's done for good.

324
00:21:21,040 --> 00:21:26,080
Maybe that should be our annual motto that we still haven't come up with.

325
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:30,320
Seriously though, Kony 2013.

326
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:32,640
This time for sure.

327
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:40,400
See, I gave Griffin one this weekend, but I don't think he liked it.

328
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:41,520
How does Luke warm on it?

329
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:42,080
What was it?

330
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:44,240
2013.

331
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:46,800
Get it out.

332
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:47,840
Dig it up.

333
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:48,800
Get it out.

334
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:49,680
Get the dirt out.

335
00:21:49,680 --> 00:21:50,400
It's 13.

336
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:54,320
13 would be the hashtag.

337
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:55,120
Nobody's using it.

338
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:58,560
We'd have like full control over 13.

339
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:02,080
We were all about getting it, and now you've got it.

340
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:02,880
What do you do with it?

341
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:04,320
You got to get the dirt out.

342
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:07,520
You know, someone else, I saw somebody post on Twitter, 20 did.

343
00:22:09,040 --> 00:22:13,680
Well, I like it to be a little bit more active, a little proactive, you know?

344
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:16,240
I take it this way.

345
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:17,920
So you can say what you did.

346
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:22,480
Right, but if you chill on it for a second, if you stop for a second,

347
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:26,480
and you turn your eyes away from the heavens and in front of you,

348
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:29,520
your feet in front of you, and you look behind you, you're going to trip.

349
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:30,320
Then you're going to die.

350
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:34,480
Yeah, I don't want to take a moment to rest on our laurels.

351
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:37,280
You might as well be eating mashed potatoes with a spoon.

352
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:39,040
Yeah, that's not somebody who's active.

353
00:22:39,040 --> 00:22:41,040
That's not somebody who's there to get it.

354
00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:42,640
I eat mashed potatoes with a knife.

355
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:47,680
Well, okay, the annualized motto question is so important,

356
00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:50,320
so let's knock this mashed potatoes bullshit out of the way real quick.

357
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:52,560
You're going to eat it with a fork because it's there with something

358
00:22:52,560 --> 00:22:54,000
that you're also eating with a fork,

359
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:58,560
and you're not going to put down that fork that you're eating turkey or ham or steak with

360
00:22:58,560 --> 00:23:03,920
to pick up, like you're not going to take the time to manually reach down and switch tools.

361
00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:06,400
You're just going to eat it with the fork and the spoon's going to go unused.

362
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:09,520
Right, that sounds like the perfect solution.

363
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:11,600
You'll try to eat soup with that fucking fork,

364
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:14,000
if it means you don't have to go back down and do a switcheroo.

365
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:17,840
That sounds like the, yes, you're 100% right.

366
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:18,640
Nailed it.

367
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:19,440
Nailed it.

368
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:22,240
Now about 2013.

369
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:25,440
Now I've seen people say the 20 Bakers does, which I like.

370
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:27,440
I like that, but like, it's right there.

371
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:32,240
I don't feel that it has anything contextually to do with any kind of message,

372
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:36,800
unless our suggestion is that in 2013 everyone should become bakers.

373
00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:44,000
Mm-hmm, my problem with 2013 is that it makes us sound fucking stupid every time we say it.

374
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:46,480
How many is this, 13?

375
00:23:47,680 --> 00:23:49,760
It is a 13 year.

376
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:54,160
I don't think we would, I don't think we would say the 20.

377
00:23:55,040 --> 00:23:59,600
Why not just, I mean, before it's 20 does it, and we said 20 does, why not just 20 dirt?

378
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:02,800
20 dirt, no, I like that.

379
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:05,360
20 dirt, I like a lot.

380
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:06,240
I like a lot.

381
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:08,080
Griffin, how do you feel about 20 dirt?

382
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:11,840
I don't know how I feel.

383
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:12,800
It made me giggle.

384
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:16,000
You feel strongly about it, you just don't know strongly in what way.

385
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:20,720
I was halfway there with 2013, and Travis had to come take you home to 20 dirt.

386
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:22,800
Okay, but here's the problem though.

387
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:26,960
What if someone's dirt is like, I fucked my dog 10 years ago.

388
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:28,640
Like that dirt, just keep it in.

389
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:30,480
That's been way out on their shoulders then.

390
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:33,120
That's been crushing them.

391
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:37,440
We've always been about honesty, and we've always been about forthrightness, and about

392
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:42,640
getting it off your chest, and getting it out there, and this is the year that we crystallize

393
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:48,640
that, formalize it, and euthanize it, and really say, dirt, 20 dirt, get it out.

394
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:49,440
Get it out.

395
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:50,400
Get it out in 20 dirt.

396
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:51,360
Get it out, dig it out.

397
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:53,680
Dig it up, set it free.

398
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:56,880
Wash it out, eat it up.

399
00:24:57,520 --> 00:24:58,960
Don't eat it out.

400
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:00,240
Don't eat it, that's dirty.

401
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:02,720
Don't eat it out.

402
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:03,680
Brush it off.

403
00:25:03,680 --> 00:25:04,560
Blow it.

404
00:25:04,560 --> 00:25:04,960
Blow it.

405
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:05,440
Spray it.

406
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:06,480
Stop formatting.

407
00:25:07,040 --> 00:25:08,800
Put it back into the NES.

408
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:09,600
See if it plays.

409
00:25:10,160 --> 00:25:11,040
20 dirt.

410
00:25:11,040 --> 00:25:11,600
20 dirt.

411
00:25:12,160 --> 00:25:13,840
Okay, I'll go there with you.

412
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:14,320
All right.

413
00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:17,760
I frequent a nearby arcade, and when I'm there, I like to play some of the games that give

414
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:19,840
tickets or rewards, such as skeeball.

415
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:24,640
However, as a grown man, I have absolutely no use for these tickets whatsoever.

416
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:28,080
I usually look for the nearest child at the end of the day, and hand them a fistful of

417
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:30,400
tickets to brighten their day.

418
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:34,240
However, I am worried this makes me look like a creeper.

419
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:35,600
Is it acceptable to do?

420
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:41,120
Should I just leave the tickets in the machine for kids to stumble upon themselves, or should

421
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:44,960
I stop doing this entirely and just leave with a handful of spider rings every time?

422
00:25:46,160 --> 00:25:47,760
That's from No Ticky No Problem.

423
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:49,200
All right.

424
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:50,400
Okay.

425
00:25:51,040 --> 00:25:52,080
Straight up.

426
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:52,800
Yeah.

427
00:25:52,800 --> 00:25:57,600
This is one of the problems, I think, of the modern age, and it really frustrates me.

428
00:25:57,600 --> 00:26:02,400
In what way is giving a child the tickets you're not going to use creepy?

429
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:06,720
Well, Trapp, that is the problem of the modern age, is that everybody thinks that everyone

430
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:09,680
else is trying to fuck them constantly.

431
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:10,800
Right?

432
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:12,800
Constantly.

433
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:18,400
I was just playing croquet in the park, and a dude walked by with his dog, and I gripped

434
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:19,360
my mallet.

435
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:25,440
I gripped my mallet in a stance that made me look threatening in case he tried to come

436
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:28,720
over and get some touch.

437
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:30,960
Did you come over and dirty your ascot?

438
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:33,360
Now, did you spill-

439
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:34,800
He almost spilled my mimosa.

440
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:37,120
He almost spilled my cucumber soda.

441
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:39,280
I'm trying to play croquet over here.

442
00:26:39,280 --> 00:26:40,640
I hand-juiced that.

443
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:46,160
I think that problem is certainly, certainly exacerbated when you have a child, because

444
00:26:46,160 --> 00:26:50,240
you better believe if I have my child, and I was teaching him the betters of croquet,

445
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:53,440
I was teaching him the rules and proper etiquette of hammerball.

446
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:57,120
While still not disturbing the plate of cucumber sandwiches.

447
00:26:57,120 --> 00:26:58,080
Correct.

448
00:26:58,080 --> 00:26:58,880
The croquetiquette.

449
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:04,160
The croquetiquette of it all, and a person came within my line of sight, I would probably

450
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:06,560
just chase them down and beat them to death with the hammer.

451
00:27:06,560 --> 00:27:07,060
Yeah.

452
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:08,080
Yeah.

453
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:14,400
Now, just so I can double-check, you felt threatened at a moment when you had a giant

454
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:15,680
wooden hammer in your hand?

455
00:27:15,680 --> 00:27:18,480
Is that, just so I'm clear about the situation you found yourself in?

456
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:24,240
Mm-hmm, but I was wearing a headscarf to protect myself from the sun's rays.

457
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:27,920
So the two really cancel each other out.

458
00:27:27,920 --> 00:27:28,320
Right.

459
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:32,640
You were worried that you might get confused and actually hit him with the parasol you

460
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:33,600
were holding in your hand.

461
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:37,280
I was delicately dabbing the corners of my mouth with a pocket square.

462
00:27:37,280 --> 00:27:38,880
You had no free hand to clobber.

463
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:39,380
Exactly.

464
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:40,480
I get it.

465
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:44,240
I was also singing a little song.

466
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:49,120
I was singing the most flop-ish song I could think of.

467
00:27:50,560 --> 00:27:54,160
You noticed that only one of your loafers actually had a penny slid inside of it.

468
00:27:54,160 --> 00:27:54,800
That's correct.

469
00:27:54,800 --> 00:27:58,240
Made a note to burn them when you got home.

470
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:04,720
Yeah, I understand why you think it's creepy.

471
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:11,520
And as much as I'd like to say, well, sorry, society, this seems like one where you just

472
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:15,920
got to kind of hope that things change, I have two solutions for you.

473
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:19,280
One, people have had children for worse reasons.

474
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:23,680
If you have your own kids, then you can give them all your tickets.

475
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:26,880
People have had kids for worse reasons than that.

476
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:28,080
Okay?

477
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:28,880
That's number one.

478
00:28:29,680 --> 00:28:37,280
Number two, there are prizes that every kid goes in and they look and they say, you know,

479
00:28:37,280 --> 00:28:40,880
they play, they had a cast party there, they had a post soccer party.

480
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:42,400
I know where you're going with this and I love it.

481
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:45,200
And you look at it and you're like, oh my God, a bike?

482
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:48,640
Who has enough to get a bike?

483
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:51,280
There's no way I could ever save up 10,000 tickets.

484
00:28:51,280 --> 00:28:52,720
That's astronomically high.

485
00:28:52,720 --> 00:29:00,160
You could be a guy who comes in one day with a laundry basket full of tickets and dumps

486
00:29:00,160 --> 00:29:03,280
it out and say, I'll take the bike.

487
00:29:03,280 --> 00:29:09,440
And you can ride this stubby little 10-speed out the door while kids are cheering like,

488
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:11,520
yeah, he did it, this one's for us.

489
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:15,280
You would take down the bike and there's just like a dirt imprint around it where it's just

490
00:29:15,280 --> 00:29:16,800
been on the wall for so long.

491
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:22,000
You would be too excited when you handed over that laundry hamper of tickets.

492
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:26,160
You would be too excited to just say, I'll have the bike.

493
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:29,520
Like you would involuntarily shout like, eat my dick.

494
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:33,520
Eat my dick, Tilt.

495
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:35,360
Give me that shit.

496
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:36,880
Bike me.

497
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:43,200
Get it off the wall, bike me, dick.

498
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:46,800
Or you just go in with your laundry basket, but you're so excited you get all tongue-tied

499
00:29:46,800 --> 00:29:48,400
and you go, all the rings.

500
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:51,760
It's legally binding.

501
00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:55,360
Once you say it.

502
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:58,400
I'll have three and a half miles of Laffy Taffy.

503
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:00,240
Fuck, I love those jokes.

504
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:05,280
I specifically told myself not to say it.

505
00:30:05,280 --> 00:30:09,520
I was just thinking, don't say that about the Laffy Taffy.

506
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:13,920
Hey, Dillweed, I'll take the electronic battleship, please.

507
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:16,160
I'll take the 13-inch-

508
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:23,120
I'll take the 13-inch TV that you can plug into your cigarette lighter for before.

509
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:28,640
I think, wasn't it at the pub, Gino's Pub in Huntington, West Virginia.

510
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:30,800
Wasn't the big prize a Lincoln Town Car?

511
00:30:30,800 --> 00:30:31,840
Or am I making that up?

512
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:33,040
You are high on-

513
00:30:33,040 --> 00:30:33,920
So fucking high.

514
00:30:33,920 --> 00:30:34,880
No, sir.

515
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:36,400
There is no thing like that.

516
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:37,200
Yeah, I swear to-

517
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:40,880
For 14 and a half million tickets.

518
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:43,200
I was just there.

519
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:51,280
Now you do run the risk of, the problem is that arcades in this culture, they're closing.

520
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:54,640
We just lost Tilt at the Huntington Mall.

521
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:57,120
What if I had been saving up?

522
00:30:57,840 --> 00:30:59,760
That shit is not transferable.

523
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:03,760
There's not a Swiss bank account where you can deposit all your tickets

524
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:05,120
when Tilt goes out of biz.

525
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:06,880
That's why you go to Mr. Gaddy's.

526
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:11,600
They accept all tickets at Gaddy's.

527
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:12,400
They're not choosy.

528
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:14,400
That's actually their motto.

529
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:14,800
Fuck it.

530
00:31:14,800 --> 00:31:15,520
We'll take them.

531
00:31:15,520 --> 00:31:16,000
Gaddy's.

532
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:19,440
Our pizza's garbage, but we'll take your tickets.

533
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:21,760
All we have is Laffy Taffy, though.

534
00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:27,040
What you definitely don't want to do is leave the tickets in the machine and let kids get them

535
00:31:27,040 --> 00:31:30,080
because you are going to get so many fucking orbits.

536
00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:34,400
You're going to get so many clingers and barnacles that will just like rush in

537
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:35,680
and then they'll get shitty about it.

538
00:31:36,800 --> 00:31:39,920
They'll just like stand behind you and be like, 900 points, huh?

539
00:31:39,920 --> 00:31:40,560
It's the best you can do.

540
00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:41,600
Scott.

541
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:45,120
I did have my eye on a slap bracelet.

542
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:46,880
Thanks, Scott.

543
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:47,920
Thanks, Scott.

544
00:31:47,920 --> 00:31:51,440
One of those fucking styrofoam airplanes,

545
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:54,320
but I guess this is just going to go ahead and be the worst birthday ever.

546
00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:54,960
Thanks, Scott.

547
00:31:54,960 --> 00:32:00,640
Scott, sorry you couldn't ski ball better, idiot.

548
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:01,520
Oh, Scott.

549
00:32:02,160 --> 00:32:04,720
I'll just call my dad and tell him to pick me up now, Scott,

550
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:07,600
because this obviously isn't your hot day, Scott.

551
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:15,680
You could just tear them up in front of the kids.

552
00:32:15,680 --> 00:32:16,480
Oh, man.

553
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:19,760
Just burn them in the park.

554
00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:21,440
What a power play that is.

555
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:22,880
Hey, kids, come over to the parking lot.

556
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:24,560
I got something I want to show you.

557
00:32:24,560 --> 00:32:26,560
Look at all these tickets I've collected.

558
00:32:27,520 --> 00:32:30,160
Well, if you're worried about creeping kids out,

559
00:32:30,160 --> 00:32:33,840
I think walking backwards with a fistful of tickets into the parking lot,

560
00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:35,760
screaming, follow me into the parking lot.

561
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:38,480
That dog probably won't like it.

562
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:39,280
And the liar.

563
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:41,040
Come on, kids.

564
00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:46,800
You could pile them up in your back seat and have a lot of awkward conversations.

565
00:32:47,680 --> 00:32:48,960
You want some tickets?

566
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:51,440
Did you want some tickets for next time?

567
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:53,200
You know what would actually be great?

568
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:54,080
What?

569
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:57,120
I mean, it would be better if we thought of this a month ago,

570
00:32:57,120 --> 00:32:58,640
but like a tree garland.

571
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:00,640
Beautiful.

572
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:02,320
That would be very nice.

573
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:03,360
That would be tasteful.

574
00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:07,760
You know, at the Geno's Pub and Family Fun Center on Fifth Avenue,

575
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:10,800
you can't give the guy tickets.

576
00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:13,040
The guy won't count your tickets.

577
00:33:13,040 --> 00:33:13,280
Right.

578
00:33:13,280 --> 00:33:14,320
You have to feed them.

579
00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:15,440
The magic counter thing.

580
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:17,040
Yeah, you got to feed them in the machine.

581
00:33:17,040 --> 00:33:17,600
Do you know why?

582
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:25,120
Why? Because we're living in a really bad time period where hard work is not valued.

583
00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:27,920
Well, and also because that man doesn't know maths.

584
00:33:29,040 --> 00:33:30,320
Hey, I used to be that man.

585
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:30,560
Yeah.

586
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:34,160
Fair enough.

587
00:33:34,160 --> 00:33:35,760
We need to move on.

588
00:33:36,400 --> 00:33:37,600
Do we want to go?

589
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:51,040
Yeah, let's count all the money that we made.

590
00:33:51,040 --> 00:33:52,320
Who's in our magic mirror today?

591
00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:53,600
Who's getting a special treatment?

592
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:56,880
I'm throwing it out to Joshua Colt Kelly.

593
00:33:56,880 --> 00:33:57,920
Cool name, Josh.

594
00:33:59,280 --> 00:34:01,600
I think he has to be a cowboy with that name.

595
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:04,080
With a name like that, he's like a train robber.

596
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:07,920
Fucking three people that are trying to get in,

597
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:09,680
and I think they're trying to cram it on us.

598
00:34:09,680 --> 00:34:12,080
To Joshua Kelly and Colt from Three Ninjas?

599
00:34:12,720 --> 00:34:14,640
Or Colt McCoy, the football man.

600
00:34:16,160 --> 00:34:18,240
There's a football man named Colt McCoy.

601
00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:21,920
This message comes from Britt, Cam, Adam, Yasir, and Jones.

602
00:34:21,920 --> 00:34:26,080
I'm telling you, two of those people know Josh, one knows Colt, and two know Kelly.

603
00:34:26,080 --> 00:34:27,280
I'm telling you, we are getting fucked.

604
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:28,720
Why are you shortchanging Colt?

605
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:30,560
Colt might know all of them.

606
00:34:30,560 --> 00:34:34,560
Maybe one of them knows Josh and Kelly, and the rest are friends with Colt,

607
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:36,560
and they're like, well, if you want to get on the Colt train.

608
00:34:36,560 --> 00:34:41,680
Now, this is, okay, this is answered in the next section.

609
00:34:41,680 --> 00:34:45,120
Happy birthday, Josh, from Britt, Cam, Adam, Yasir, and Jones.

610
00:34:45,120 --> 00:34:48,560
Please enjoy these finely crafted jokes we've purchased for you.

611
00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:50,720
Brothers, make funny goos, especially Griffin.

612
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:54,320
Oh, there's like, this is an instruction here.

613
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:57,680
Now, I want to point out, we got a follow-up email to correct the fact

614
00:34:57,680 --> 00:35:03,200
that they spelled it crafted, but that's all I can think of

615
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:06,880
from this entire email is finely crafted jokes.

616
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:10,240
I'm just thinking about how we're getting shortchanged.

617
00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:13,920
If you guys just make this right, send us like an extra,

618
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:16,080
an extra few Benjis and we'll be cool.

619
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:19,040
Toss a few Benjis our way and we'll be straight.

620
00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:21,200
Just give us some tiny famous dogs.

621
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:22,720
Speaking of tiny famous dogs.

622
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:28,000
ExtremeRestraints.com is your home for bone.

623
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:30,960
It's a new thing I came up with.

624
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:32,400
Your home for bone.

625
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:39,120
This is the one day of the week when I get to go to a site with naked ladies on it

626
00:35:39,120 --> 00:35:42,560
and my wife can't get mad when she checks my eye history.

627
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:48,320
When you say eye history, do you mean she has doctor skills to go in

628
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:50,560
and look at everything you looked at with your eyes?

629
00:35:50,560 --> 00:35:52,400
Yes, exactly, precisely.

630
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:54,400
Bondage bedsheets.

631
00:35:54,400 --> 00:36:01,200
It may be a way for you and your partner to start exploring the exciting world of S&M

632
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:06,880
that you may have heard of in the hit novel, 50 Shades of Grey.

633
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:08,640
Isn't every bedsheet a bondage?

634
00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:10,400
I almost said Eat, Pray, Love.

635
00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:14,560
The author of Eat, Pray, Love listens to our podcast.

636
00:36:14,560 --> 00:36:16,960
The hit psychosex rom.

637
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:20,960
The hit psychosexual Eat, Pray, Love.

638
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:28,320
Elizabeth Gilbert, if you have managed to stick with it and are still listening,

639
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:32,960
consider, I'm not telling you how to do your work because you're obviously very good at it,

640
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:36,720
but if you could work some crazy fucking into the next book.

641
00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:38,720
Maybe like Eat, Pray, Love, Sexing.

642
00:36:38,720 --> 00:36:40,560
Eat, Pray, Love, This Butthole.

643
00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:44,240
Eat, Pray, Love, Shower.

644
00:36:44,240 --> 00:36:52,560
The Handy Snatch Masturbator is a mouthful to say and a dickful to have sex with.

645
00:36:54,720 --> 00:36:57,440
Oh man, I thought I could finish it, but this is a dickful.

646
00:36:59,360 --> 00:37:01,920
My dick is bigger than my eyes or something.

647
00:37:03,040 --> 00:37:07,280
I am stuffed into this realistic feeling latex.

648
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:10,880
Ladies, I don't mean to brag, but my dick's bigger than my eyes.

649
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:15,920
If you put them together, it would be bigger than the two of them.

650
00:37:17,120 --> 00:37:21,600
Then there's the Mouth Thruster Masturbator, which is just a mouth and a tongue.

651
00:37:21,600 --> 00:37:24,800
It's kind of horrifying, like a cast off from Mominshans.

652
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:31,200
You can put your finger in it or something that's not your finger, where the P comes out.

653
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:35,200

You're welcome.

658
00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:49,840
Good Extreme Restraints ads from this show is like slam poetry.

659
00:37:49,840 --> 00:37:58,080
Like when we are on and like the cadence of it is, ah, the meter, it's poignant and powerful.

660
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:04,480
This is breaking, just breaking, breaking in.

661
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:05,280
Come in, come in.

662
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:05,920
Can you read me?

663
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:06,480
Can you read me?

664
00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:09,120
This is urgent.

665
00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:10,960
Urgent dispatch about Michael Keaton.

666
00:38:14,640 --> 00:38:18,880
Got a Keaton update for you from Sam coming in latest work from Sam.

667
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:22,400
He says, I just listened to the candlelight podcast where you're asking about the whereabouts

668
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:23,280
of Michael Keaton.

669
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:27,280
I work at an actual food store in Bozeman, Montana, where he frequently shops when he

670
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:31,360
is in Montana at his ranch at the Paradise Valley, about 40 miles from Bozeman.

671
00:38:31,360 --> 00:38:34,320
Although I do not know him personally, he seems to be doing fine.

672
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:38,000
He's still buying expensive food, such as fish that cost 25 pounds.

673
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:47,920
I did want to take a quick, quick break from my break to say, is there not some sort of

674
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:52,880
fish selling fish purchaser confidentiality here?

675
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:56,400
Is this not a private exchange when I went at the natural food store?

676
00:38:56,400 --> 00:39:01,200
More importantly, what the fuck kind of fish costs $25 a pound?

677
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:04,400
I'll take two pounds of the goldfish, please.

678
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:04,640
Yeah.

679
00:39:06,320 --> 00:39:10,000
He comes in with a ball cap and sunglasses no matter what time of day.

680
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:12,800
Despite the picture I'm paying of him, he's actually a really nice guy.

681
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:13,280
Courteous.

682
00:39:13,280 --> 00:39:15,200
He looks you in the eye when speaking to him.

683
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:18,880
As far as his work record, I know he was in the other guys and that is the most recent

684
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:20,720
thing I can remember, which is in 2010.

685
00:39:20,720 --> 00:39:24,240
Just want to give you the info on the little bit I know about Michael Keaton to help you

686
00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:24,960
sleep at night.

687
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:26,160
That's from Sam.

688
00:39:26,160 --> 00:39:28,960
Sam, thank you for that Keaton update.

689
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:33,840
If you are, if you are in a position to update us on Michael Keaton's whereabouts, we would

690
00:39:33,840 --> 00:39:34,800
ask that you please do it.

691
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:35,680
I mean, I don't.

692
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:38,640
I've got a big map on the wall and I'm putting push pins in it.

693
00:39:38,640 --> 00:39:41,600
So far I've got one in Bozeman, Montana.

694
00:39:41,600 --> 00:39:44,640
So I don't want to, I don't want to show two in Gotham.

695
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:52,000
I don't, I don't want to show what seems to be a very promising bit, but I saw that

696
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:56,080
motherfucker on the silver screen in a trailer for the new Superman movie plays Superman's

697
00:39:56,080 --> 00:40:00,400
Dad. You dumb motherfucker.

698
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:02,960
Do you mean Kevin Costner?

699
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:04,800
Now, listen to what I did.

700
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:05,760
Listen to what I did.

701
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:06,400
Listen to what I did.

702
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:07,040
Hold on.

703
00:40:07,040 --> 00:40:09,600
Can I, can you give me two minutes to do six degrees?

704
00:40:13,520 --> 00:40:16,320
Michael Keaton was in the Keaton-Costner transposition.

705
00:40:16,320 --> 00:40:19,440
Keaton was in Batman.

706
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:20,080
The first Batman.

707
00:40:20,080 --> 00:40:20,880
Okay.

708
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:21,600
Got it.

709
00:40:21,600 --> 00:40:27,600
With Jack Nichols, Flapjack Nicholsack.

710
00:40:30,320 --> 00:40:32,480
Jack Nichols, he's in with the Golden Bear.

711
00:40:33,680 --> 00:40:36,160
Flapjack was in One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest.

712
00:40:36,160 --> 00:40:36,640
I'm done.

713
00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:38,080
Okay.

714
00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:41,360
I did, real quick, I did want to double check this.

715
00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:48,720
So I went to IMDB and the most recent things I've looked at are Jonathan Taylor Thomas,

716
00:40:48,720 --> 00:40:51,680
Michael Keaton, apparently.

717
00:40:51,680 --> 00:40:54,080
Justin Tone, Sidewalk of Stars.

718
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:58,080
I only use IMDB when I'm doing this show.

719
00:40:58,960 --> 00:41:01,440
And when he's worried about the safety of an actor.

720
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:02,800
Just want to make sure he's okay.

721
00:41:03,440 --> 00:41:07,120
Don't you guys worry about like, like we got worried about French tour and then he made a

722
00:41:07,120 --> 00:41:07,520
comeback.

723
00:41:07,520 --> 00:41:08,560
He made a big comeback.

724
00:41:09,120 --> 00:41:13,120
I'm actually, I'm very ashamed of how often I use IMDB to check to see if someone has

725
00:41:13,120 --> 00:41:15,120
died in the last year or not and I just missed it.

726
00:41:16,240 --> 00:41:17,040
It happens a lot.

727
00:41:17,040 --> 00:41:19,040
You should, you should, you should probably be.

728
00:41:19,040 --> 00:41:20,560
Do you guys want a Yahoo?

729
00:41:20,560 --> 00:41:21,840
Yeah, yeah, I do.

730
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:24,400
This Yahoo was sent in by Ira Ray.

731
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:27,520
By the way, everybody sent in really great questions this week.

732
00:41:27,520 --> 00:41:32,480
Like I got a ton of really good submissions, but I've only read two Ira Rays in a row,

733
00:41:32,480 --> 00:41:33,920
but that's just because they're really good.

734
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:35,600
Thank you Ira Ray.

735
00:41:35,600 --> 00:41:37,600
It's by Yahoo Answers User Question Mark who asks,

736
00:41:39,680 --> 00:41:45,120
is it weird that my BF wants a puppet show for his 30th birthday?

737
00:41:45,120 --> 00:41:47,120
Whoa.

738
00:41:47,120 --> 00:41:50,640
He's never wanted anything before and if I ever ask, he says nothing.

739
00:41:51,200 --> 00:41:55,680
But today he said very seriously that he would love so much to have a puppet string,

740
00:41:55,680 --> 00:41:58,640
a string puppet show performed for his birthday.

741
00:41:58,640 --> 00:42:01,360
Should I book him one or is it weird for him to want that?

742
00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:03,600
Oh my God.

743
00:42:03,600 --> 00:42:04,560
What if it's a test?

744
00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:09,040
Or what if he's just a psychopath?

745
00:42:09,040 --> 00:42:11,440
Which seems like one of those two.

746
00:42:11,440 --> 00:42:18,160
I've never, Diane, I've never asked you for anything, but I'm turning 30 and I'm gonna

747
00:42:18,160 --> 00:42:19,520
blow it out in style.

748
00:42:21,120 --> 00:42:29,120
I want to have a man put his hand in some socks and entertain me and all my closest friends.

749
00:42:30,160 --> 00:42:31,840
Bring me some napery.

750
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:37,440
Bring me a foppish fuzz.

751
00:42:37,440 --> 00:42:39,280
Go down to the corner.

752
00:42:39,280 --> 00:42:41,680
Bring me the Punch and Judy man.

753
00:42:41,680 --> 00:42:45,280
Have him come here and entertain me with a show.

754
00:42:45,280 --> 00:42:47,520
What do you mean that's not a thing?

755
00:42:47,520 --> 00:42:48,640
That's not a thing.

756
00:42:49,200 --> 00:42:51,200
What isn't this Victorian England?

757
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:53,920
I can just picture Diane just every day.

758
00:42:53,920 --> 00:42:54,560
What do you want?

759
00:42:54,560 --> 00:42:55,440
What do you want?

760
00:42:55,440 --> 00:42:56,080
What do you want?

761
00:42:56,080 --> 00:42:56,880
What do you want?

762
00:42:56,880 --> 00:42:57,760
What do you want?

763
00:42:57,760 --> 00:42:58,480
What do you want?

764
00:42:58,480 --> 00:43:00,720
I want nothing for 29 years.

765
00:43:00,720 --> 00:43:02,560
For 29 years, nothing.

766
00:43:02,560 --> 00:43:04,800
And then he goes, okay, you want to know?

767
00:43:04,800 --> 00:43:05,360
You want to know?

768
00:43:05,920 --> 00:43:06,480
Puppet.

769
00:43:06,480 --> 00:43:09,840
Go into the street and bring me a jacket ape.

770
00:43:09,840 --> 00:43:13,200
I shall instruct him in the ways.

771
00:43:14,960 --> 00:43:17,920
Maybe her constant badgering has just broken his mind.

772
00:43:17,920 --> 00:43:18,420
Yeah.

773
00:43:20,160 --> 00:43:28,480
To me, the upsettingness of puppets is inversely proportionate to the extent to which I can

774
00:43:28,480 --> 00:43:29,440
see the puppeteer.

775
00:43:30,240 --> 00:43:32,640
If I can't see the puppeteer at all, fine.

776
00:43:32,640 --> 00:43:33,760
Take me away.

777
00:43:33,760 --> 00:43:37,200
You know, like King Friday in the land of make-believe.

778
00:43:37,200 --> 00:43:38,480
Like, that's fine.

779
00:43:38,480 --> 00:43:39,680
Whisk me away.

780
00:43:39,680 --> 00:43:47,440
If I can see a grown adult man manipulating this cloth and trying to trick me, I hate that.

781
00:43:47,440 --> 00:43:50,160
So you had huge problems with, like, Welcome to Weinerville.

782
00:43:51,600 --> 00:43:53,760
Pretty sure everybody has huge problems with Weinerville.

783
00:43:54,320 --> 00:44:01,280
Justin, can I ask, is your deep-seated hatred of visible puppetry, does it boil down to

784
00:44:01,280 --> 00:44:04,720
the fact that you just don't like seeing people do anything?

785
00:44:06,480 --> 00:44:11,360
Is it your problem with interacting with people that are doing things that you are watching?

786
00:44:12,080 --> 00:44:16,480
Griffin, I sometimes have a problem with social cues.

787
00:44:16,480 --> 00:44:16,960
Right.

788
00:44:16,960 --> 00:44:21,360
Like, I don't know, I'm in a conversation or a social scenario, and I don't exactly

789
00:44:21,360 --> 00:44:24,720
know the right thing to say in that exact situation.

790
00:44:24,720 --> 00:44:31,520
Now, if you can just blow that up and think, like, in what scenario would you have the least

791
00:44:31,520 --> 00:44:33,120
chance of saying the right thing?

792
00:44:33,120 --> 00:44:38,480
And I think it's when you make eye contact with a man whose hand is in felt.

793
00:44:38,480 --> 00:44:38,800
Yeah.

794
00:44:38,800 --> 00:44:42,480
Like, that is the number one situation, which, like, I don't know what to say to you.

795
00:44:42,480 --> 00:44:44,400
You're pretending to talk me through a puppet.

796
00:44:44,400 --> 00:44:47,600
It also boils down to the fact that they are trying to trick you.

797
00:44:48,240 --> 00:44:49,440
They really are trying to trick me.

798
00:44:49,440 --> 00:44:51,360
They're lying to you, is what they're doing.

799
00:44:51,360 --> 00:44:53,360
They're saying, look at these two small men.

800
00:44:53,360 --> 00:44:55,040
And I'm-

801
00:44:55,040 --> 00:44:57,360
I'm trying to get the dirt out over here, and you're trying to make more dirt?

802
00:44:57,360 --> 00:44:58,480
This is Tony Dirt.

803
00:44:58,480 --> 00:45:01,440
And what you're doing is you're scooping more piles on, sir.

804
00:45:02,880 --> 00:45:06,400
Why don't we just cut through the bullshit, and you tell me the story directly?

805
00:45:06,400 --> 00:45:06,720
Yeah.

806
00:45:06,720 --> 00:45:07,600
How about you sit us down-

807
00:45:07,600 --> 00:45:09,040
Cut out the tiny middle man.

808
00:45:09,920 --> 00:45:14,000
Why are you so afraid of committing to this conversation we're having?

809
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:16,160
Just weave me a tale with your words.

810
00:45:17,280 --> 00:45:18,560
And your Weinerville puppets.

811
00:45:18,560 --> 00:45:19,840
And your Weinerville puppets.

812
00:45:19,840 --> 00:45:20,640
Is leaving the Weinerville-

813
00:45:20,640 --> 00:45:22,400
Which I mean puppetry of the penis.

814
00:45:22,400 --> 00:45:29,760
Can one of you guys use your IMDb wizardry to quickly and discreetly find out how many

815
00:45:29,760 --> 00:45:31,520
seasons of Weinerville there were?

816
00:45:31,520 --> 00:45:34,240
And if anyone I know was ever on Weinerville?

817
00:45:34,960 --> 00:45:37,520
Yeah, Matthew Weiner, the creator of Mad Men.

818
00:45:38,560 --> 00:45:40,080
He was the one behind it.

819
00:45:40,080 --> 00:45:41,120
I don't think that's true.

820
00:45:42,720 --> 00:45:45,600
Okay, so they did 62 episodes of Weinerville.

821
00:45:46,160 --> 00:45:48,240
Almost enough for Cindy.

822
00:45:48,240 --> 00:45:49,680
Almost enough for Cindy.

823
00:45:49,680 --> 00:45:51,680
Almost didn't get quite to Cindy.

824
00:45:51,680 --> 00:45:54,160
We made it to Cindy almost twice now.

825
00:45:54,160 --> 00:45:56,000
I guess a little bit more than once now.

826
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:57,520
And Weinerville couldn't crest it.

827
00:45:57,520 --> 00:45:59,600
But I think that might just be because we

828
00:45:59,600 --> 00:46:03,520
don't have tiny impotent bodies attached to our chins.

829
00:46:04,240 --> 00:46:04,480
Yeah.

830
00:46:05,760 --> 00:46:09,920
Well, Mark Weiner was a writer for Saturday Night Live.

831
00:46:10,720 --> 00:46:14,640
Yeah, and he kept saying, I'd like to be on the show, but just my head.

832
00:46:15,280 --> 00:46:17,120
They're like, that's impossible.

833
00:46:17,120 --> 00:46:18,640
I got a great idea for a sketch.

834
00:46:18,640 --> 00:46:22,880
You are going to try and throw this ping-pong ball using a tiny puppet hand

835
00:46:22,880 --> 00:46:24,080
that we've attached to your chin.

836
00:46:24,080 --> 00:46:25,680
And it's going to be fucking hilarious.

837
00:46:26,480 --> 00:46:30,480
Oh, he's also the voice of Mapp and Swiper the Fox on Dora the Explorer.

838
00:46:30,480 --> 00:46:31,760
Well, there you go.

839
00:46:31,760 --> 00:46:37,360
On Nes Declassified School Survival Guide, he is credited as Mr. Weiner.

840
00:46:37,360 --> 00:46:41,520
And I think I might have discovered Mark Weiner's problem with his career.

841
00:46:41,520 --> 00:46:47,120
He refuses to appear on television unless his character makes use of his

842
00:46:47,120 --> 00:46:48,640
hilarious surname.

843
00:46:50,800 --> 00:46:51,280
What's the name?

844
00:46:51,280 --> 00:46:52,160
What's the character's name?

845
00:46:54,480 --> 00:46:56,800
No, is it Tony Soprano?

846
00:46:56,800 --> 00:46:58,240
I've got a better idea.

847
00:46:58,240 --> 00:46:59,360
Let me hit you with this.

848
00:47:00,160 --> 00:47:01,520
How about Tony Weiner?

849
00:47:01,520 --> 00:47:02,960
How about Don Draper?

850
00:47:02,960 --> 00:47:03,440
No.

851
00:47:03,440 --> 00:47:04,080
How about this?

852
00:47:04,080 --> 00:47:05,280
How about Don Weiner?

853
00:47:05,280 --> 00:47:08,080
But also, have you thought about making your body real small and weird?

854
00:47:09,840 --> 00:47:14,240
I can't believe we just fucking, what fucking obscure Nickelodeon game show

855
00:47:14,240 --> 00:47:19,120
have we not discussed in length on this podcast program?

856
00:47:19,120 --> 00:47:21,440
I think they would actually have to pre-date your birth.

857
00:47:21,440 --> 00:47:23,360
Like, I think I would have to dip into like-

858
00:47:23,360 --> 00:47:24,000
Picture Perfect?

859
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:26,560
Pinwheel, sorry?

860
00:47:26,560 --> 00:47:27,840
Picture Perfect?

861
00:47:27,840 --> 00:47:31,200
What was the one where they had the house and they had to go through

862
00:47:31,200 --> 00:47:32,560
and they had to like find the differences?

863
00:47:32,560 --> 00:47:33,520
That's finder-

864
00:47:33,520 --> 00:47:40,080
Okay, you have maybe conflated finder's keepers and picture pages-

865
00:47:40,080 --> 00:47:40,480
Picture pages.

866
00:47:40,480 --> 00:47:41,520
... hosted by Bill Cosby.

867
00:47:41,520 --> 00:47:42,240
Fuck me.

868
00:47:42,240 --> 00:47:42,800
What was the one-

869
00:47:42,800 --> 00:47:44,960
Have we done Legends of the Hidden Temple yet?

870
00:47:45,520 --> 00:47:46,240
We have to have.

871
00:47:46,240 --> 00:47:48,400
I went and sat at it for Halloween when we were doing this.

872
00:47:48,400 --> 00:47:49,440
I'm sure we discussed it.

873
00:47:49,440 --> 00:47:52,320
What was the one with the squares, the TV squares,

874
00:47:52,320 --> 00:47:54,560
and you would unveil them and they would make a picture?

875
00:47:54,560 --> 00:47:56,960
What was the My Brother, My Brother, Me when I stopped listening?

876
00:47:58,800 --> 00:48:04,320
I think it was the one where they just didn't make any jokes for like 20 minutes.

877
00:48:04,320 --> 00:48:05,440
Just named all the different-

878
00:48:05,440 --> 00:48:06,960
They just said titles of shows.

879
00:48:06,960 --> 00:48:08,800
Well, let's bring it to now.

880
00:48:08,800 --> 00:48:10,080
Let's bring it to today.

881
00:48:10,080 --> 00:48:13,840
Because how come every show on Nickelodeon is about teens trying to fuck each other?

882
00:48:13,840 --> 00:48:14,400
Huh?

883
00:48:14,400 --> 00:48:17,600
And how come it's not about them trying to figure out television riddles?

884
00:48:17,600 --> 00:48:19,280
And none of them have tiny bodies.

885
00:48:19,280 --> 00:48:22,640
None of them have tiny bodies and none of them say wiener unless they're saying,

886
00:48:22,640 --> 00:48:24,160
hey John, I want to suck your wiener.

887
00:48:24,160 --> 00:48:25,840
I'm a 15-year-old girl.

888
00:48:25,840 --> 00:48:27,200
It's disgusting.

889
00:48:27,200 --> 00:48:28,240
When I was a child-

890
00:48:29,440 --> 00:48:30,560
I behaved as a child.

891
00:48:30,560 --> 00:48:34,560
I behaved as a child and I watched The Adventures of the Little Prince,

892
00:48:34,560 --> 00:48:37,280
Picture Pages, Belle and Sebastian, Danger Mouse,

893
00:48:37,280 --> 00:48:40,800
and Curious George, and so many others when I was a child.

894
00:48:41,680 --> 00:48:44,960
And then, and like, and the shows used to be so good.

895
00:48:44,960 --> 00:48:51,520
Guys remember like, Are You Afraid of the Dark and Sleuth Shorts and Clarissa and Welcome Freshmen and Hey Dude?

896
00:48:51,520 --> 00:48:54,240
Do you think Linda Ellerby was ever like, hey, you want to fuck?

897
00:48:54,240 --> 00:48:55,120
Of course not.

898
00:48:55,120 --> 00:48:58,080
She wanted to talk to you about the news, the important issues to you.

899
00:48:58,080 --> 00:48:58,800
She wanted to-

900
00:48:58,800 --> 00:49:00,400
She cared about global warming and shit.

901
00:49:00,400 --> 00:49:02,640
She wanted to open up about the cancer that she beat.

902
00:49:02,640 --> 00:49:07,040
And like, and now I have to watch Drake and Josh try to open up about it.

903
00:49:07,040 --> 00:49:09,520
Try to have sex with each other or something.

904
00:49:09,520 --> 00:49:10,640
I don't watch that show either.

905
00:49:10,640 --> 00:49:13,440
But like, it sounds like that's what's happening.

906
00:49:14,160 --> 00:49:16,400
It did seem like Moe was trying to party though.

907
00:49:17,120 --> 00:49:18,160
Moe was down to party.

908
00:49:18,160 --> 00:49:19,760
She laid it on just a little thick.

909
00:49:20,400 --> 00:49:23,680
I wanted to talk about a glowing piece of that radical rock.

910
00:49:23,680 --> 00:49:27,680
And she wanted to talk about a glowing piece of my radical cock.

911
00:49:27,680 --> 00:49:28,320
There it is.

912
00:49:28,320 --> 00:49:28,640
Thank you.

913
00:49:29,280 --> 00:49:29,840
Sure.

914
00:49:29,840 --> 00:49:30,320
Why not?

915
00:49:31,520 --> 00:49:33,680
There are several, several great reasons why not.

916
00:49:33,680 --> 00:49:37,280
Yeah, many, including time and size.

917
00:49:39,360 --> 00:49:40,000
Spatial.

918
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:40,960
Mainly spatial.

919
00:49:41,600 --> 00:49:45,200
Spatial ratios to physical space right now.

920
00:49:45,200 --> 00:49:46,480
And time, chrono-

921
00:49:46,480 --> 00:49:47,440
And confetti.

922
00:49:47,440 --> 00:49:50,880
And it was full of jets of confetti, which is not positive.

923
00:49:51,920 --> 00:49:53,280
There are chrono-spatial reasons.

924
00:49:53,280 --> 00:49:54,480
Oh, oh, sorry, baby.

925
00:49:54,480 --> 00:49:56,080
Looks like you missed an actuator.

926
00:49:58,480 --> 00:49:59,600
Hold on, hold on.

927
00:49:59,600 --> 00:50:01,680
Inside my desk, I put this in here yesterday.

928
00:50:01,680 --> 00:50:02,960
It's a sealed envelope.

929
00:50:02,960 --> 00:50:04,160
Let me just open it up real quick.

930
00:50:04,720 --> 00:50:06,400
On this piece of paper, I wrote,

931
00:50:06,400 --> 00:50:09,600
we are going to talk about literally fucking the aggro crag.

932
00:50:10,560 --> 00:50:11,760
I predicted it.

933
00:50:11,760 --> 00:50:13,040
I mailed this to myself.

934
00:50:13,760 --> 00:50:17,520
What an odd power you've been given.

935
00:50:19,280 --> 00:50:25,600
So that's just a little sampling of my brother, my brother, and me for you.

936
00:50:25,600 --> 00:50:27,520
That's kind of a thing we do here.

937
00:50:27,520 --> 00:50:31,040
Whatever that was that you just listened to, that's pretty much what we do.

938
00:50:31,040 --> 00:50:33,120
And we're sorry.

939
00:50:33,120 --> 00:50:35,600
And we're sorry you've heard it now and you can't unhear it.

940
00:50:35,600 --> 00:50:37,680
So maybe you should just hear more of it.

941
00:50:37,680 --> 00:50:41,120
Maybe you'll come back around on the other end.

942
00:50:42,080 --> 00:50:43,360
Thank you for listening, though.

943
00:50:44,160 --> 00:50:53,600
Thank you to people tweeting about the show, like Happy Bob, Eric Nottenrice.

944
00:50:54,160 --> 00:50:55,360
Man, that's a mouthful.

945
00:50:55,360 --> 00:50:56,080
I don't know.

946
00:50:56,080 --> 00:50:58,240
Brandon McStamm, Note in Color, The Davenporter,

947
00:50:58,240 --> 00:51:02,240
J. Ryan Johnson, Iggy K. Kuber, Kuber, sorry, Jacob Blocker,

948
00:51:03,600 --> 00:51:07,600
Para Delonian, Logan Bonner, David Fave.

949
00:51:07,600 --> 00:51:09,680
Thank you guys for tweeting about our program.

950
00:51:09,680 --> 00:51:12,320
It really means a lot to us.

951
00:51:12,320 --> 00:51:19,360
And if you want to spread the show even more, tweet about our sampler bit.ly forward slash

952
00:51:19,360 --> 00:51:20,400
it's b-b-bam.

953
00:51:20,400 --> 00:51:25,120
It would be great if 20 dirt was the year that we fucking exploded.

954
00:51:25,120 --> 00:51:26,160
Wouldn't that be great?

955
00:51:26,160 --> 00:51:30,880
Like, I, I'd love like publicity wise, not like physically, not physically, but I would

956
00:51:30,880 --> 00:51:35,760
love it if like we like became like if we became like the new Drake and Josh.

957
00:51:35,760 --> 00:51:37,200
Only there would have to be a third one.

958
00:51:37,200 --> 00:51:38,240
Blake and Drake and Josh.

959
00:51:39,520 --> 00:51:43,040
I would love it if like Michael Keaton started asking about what we were up to.

960
00:51:43,040 --> 00:51:44,080
Yeah, yeah.

961
00:51:45,040 --> 00:51:47,040
Why doesn't he want to start on our life story?

962
00:51:47,040 --> 00:51:51,200
They there's obviously a bunch of them because they were in multiplicity.

963
00:51:51,760 --> 00:51:53,200
So he could do that.

964
00:51:53,200 --> 00:51:59,680
With Michael Keaton as Justin, Michael Keaton as Travis, and introducing Michael Keaton

965
00:51:59,680 --> 00:52:00,720
as Griffin.

966
00:52:00,720 --> 00:52:02,800
And as Clint McElroy, Rachel Billson.

967
00:52:03,920 --> 00:52:05,440
Because why the fuck not?

968
00:52:05,440 --> 00:52:06,480
Because why not?

969
00:52:06,480 --> 00:52:07,920
Never going to happen anyway.

970
00:52:08,720 --> 00:52:10,720
And Eddie Murphy plays everyone else.

971
00:52:10,720 --> 00:52:12,400
We're going to toil at obscurity.

972
00:52:12,400 --> 00:52:14,320
Jesse Thorne played by Eddie Murphy.

973
00:52:16,480 --> 00:52:18,720
Eddie Murphy as Simon Thorne also.

974
00:52:18,720 --> 00:52:20,080
And they talk about it a lot.

975
00:52:20,080 --> 00:52:23,760
Eddie Murphy as Simon Thorne also, and they talk to each other.

976
00:52:23,760 --> 00:52:24,880
It's amazing.

977
00:52:24,880 --> 00:52:26,640
It's the best scene in the whole fucking movie.

978
00:52:27,600 --> 00:52:29,520
Eddie Murphy played by Michael Keaton.

979
00:52:30,480 --> 00:52:31,520
As Michael Keaton.

980
00:52:36,240 --> 00:52:37,040
What haven't we mentioned?

981
00:52:37,040 --> 00:52:40,160

Batman.

987
00:52:49,120 --> 00:52:50,800
What was it?

988
00:52:50,800 --> 00:52:51,360
Batman.

989
00:52:51,360 --> 00:52:51,920
Batman.

990
00:52:51,920 --> 00:52:52,800
The podcast.

991
00:52:52,800 --> 00:52:53,280
Batman.

995
00:53:03,440 --> 00:53:04,400
I want to thank John Roderick.

996
00:53:04,400 --> 00:53:04,960
Special thanks.

997
00:53:04,960 --> 00:53:05,600
Oh, damn.

998
00:53:05,600 --> 00:53:06,800
And I was going to do it this week.

999
00:53:06,800 --> 00:53:07,760
I want to thank John Roderick.

1000
00:53:07,760 --> 00:53:08,480
Do you want to do it?

1001
00:53:09,200 --> 00:53:10,240
I mean, I've never done it.

1002
00:53:10,240 --> 00:53:10,480
Go for it.

1003
00:53:10,480 --> 00:53:10,960
Give it a try.

1004
00:53:11,840 --> 00:53:13,360
I want to thank John Roderick.

1005
00:53:13,360 --> 00:53:14,080
You're yelling.

1006
00:53:14,080 --> 00:53:14,580
Boo.

1007
00:53:17,680 --> 00:53:18,320
Go ahead.

1008
00:53:18,320 --> 00:53:21,840
I want to thank John Roderick and the Long Winners for the use of our theme song,

1009
00:53:21,840 --> 00:53:23,840
It's a Departure, off the album Put in the Days to Bed.

1010
00:53:23,840 --> 00:53:25,760
You can find that on iTunes and buy it.

1011
00:53:26,880 --> 00:53:32,960
Justin got me the John Roderick, John Colton Christmas album, one Christmas at a time.

1012
00:53:32,960 --> 00:53:36,480
And inside the box is a candy cane and some gelt.

1013
00:53:36,480 --> 00:53:40,240
And I don't know if they're actually good to eat because it came in a box that you got

1014
00:53:40,240 --> 00:53:42,320
shipped to Amazon and then gave to me.

1015
00:53:42,320 --> 00:53:44,080
I think those are good for like ever.

1016
00:53:44,080 --> 00:53:44,480
OK.

1017
00:53:44,480 --> 00:53:45,920
Well, I'll give it a try and I'll report back.

1018
00:53:45,920 --> 00:53:48,960
This final Yahoo answer was also sent in by Ira Ray.

1019
00:53:48,960 --> 00:53:49,680
Thank you so much.

1020
00:53:50,720 --> 00:53:54,160
It's by Yahoo Answers user, you don't even know, who asks,

1021
00:53:56,160 --> 00:53:59,520
how did Fred Savage go back in time to narrate himself?

1022
00:54:02,800 --> 00:54:04,000
I'm Justin McElroy.

1023
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:04,960
I'm Kevin Feinberg.

1024
00:54:04,960 --> 00:54:06,000
I'm Griffin McElroy.

1025
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:07,120
This has been my brother, my brother.

1026
00:54:07,120 --> 00:54:16,720
And may you kiss your dad square on the lips.
