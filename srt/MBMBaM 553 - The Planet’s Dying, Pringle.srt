1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,820
The McElroy brothers are not experts and their advice should never be followed

2
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:10,580
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it

3
00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:17,660
Also, this show isn't for kids which I mentioned only so the babies out there will know how cool they are for listening

4
00:00:17,660 --> 00:00:30,660
What's up, you cool, baby?

5
00:00:48,380 --> 00:00:50,380
It's better it's better with you

6
00:00:53,980 --> 00:00:56,060
It's better it's better with you

7
00:01:00,340 --> 00:01:02,340
Better it's better

8
00:01:10,900 --> 00:01:15,580
Hello everybody and welcome to my brother my brother and me and if I show the modern era

9
00:01:15,580 --> 00:01:22,420
I'm your oldest brother Justin McElroy. Woof woof. That's me chasing my own tail. I'm old dog Travis McElroy

10
00:01:22,420 --> 00:01:27,300
You're his brother. I'm jealous of Travis's thing cuz he's been doing it. Yeah

11
00:01:28,260 --> 00:01:33,140
You ever see those videos? Hey, hey, hey, you ever seen one of them videos on

12
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:38,300
Facebook where the people share like I took a picture of myself every day for ten years

13
00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:42,180
Yeah, I see that and I'm like fuck that looks cool. I wish I could have done that

14
00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:46,660
But then I think that's too late. I can't you guys you guys lack

15
00:01:47,260 --> 00:01:54,340
Commitment to really anything but let alone bits and that's why if I start doing a bit even if everybody hates it

16
00:01:54,340 --> 00:01:56,340
I'll just keep doing it. You know what I mean?

17
00:01:56,460 --> 00:02:01,700
Yeah, it's a good bit and I'm Griffin McElroy. You could start doing it now Griffin

18
00:02:01,700 --> 00:02:07,060
You know the best time to start doing an intro bit is yesterday and the second best time is today. Damn

19
00:02:07,540 --> 00:02:10,060
That's good shit, except we weren't recording yesterday

20
00:02:10,060 --> 00:02:13,060
So then I would have just weren't then what was I doing?

21
00:02:14,140 --> 00:02:15,420
so

22
00:02:15,420 --> 00:02:17,420
Do we have an intro? I?

23
00:02:17,820 --> 00:02:24,100
Thought we'd just check in as bro. Oh, okay. No, sorry. Mine was more of a faithful. Yeah, I bet

24
00:02:25,900 --> 00:02:27,900
I have to I have to imagine

25
00:02:28,140 --> 00:02:32,940
Otherwise, why did we start recording? There's a you know that kind of deal. There's an emptiness in your heart

26
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:39,240
There's an emptiness in this in the in our heart and my shit in this show speak on that

27
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:42,040
Yeah, Griffin folded that impulse. Okay. Well

28
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:45,920
When we're doing this show we rely on

29
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:52,800
It on the bit on the bits to sort of float us through the hour, right?

30
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,280
But without the bits

31
00:02:55,280 --> 00:03:02,000
It's just the three of us sort of standing in a big white empty room and it's so bright in here

32
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,800
And it's bright because it's exposing us. We are nude

33
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:12,280
Because there's no bits to hide our shame behind and there's a there's a huge emptiness here now

34
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:15,640
I get that Griffin, but maybe that means that this is where we'll do our best work

35
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:16,920
I think for too long

36
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:23,680
The three of us have relied literally for the entire length of the show have relied on you know, bits Yahoo answers

37
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:29,640
Questions having ideas these kinds of things. We've relied on that too heavily

38
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:32,760
So what if we just did a whole episode where we didn't make any jokes?

39
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:34,760
We didn't come up with any good ideas

40
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:41,840
We didn't have any thought starters or anything. We just kind of actually as liberating as that sounds

41
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:44,880
I feel like we've unintentionally tried that a few times in the last few years

42
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:50,040
Yeah, and I tried that too and it didn't go good. The response hasn't been great

43
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:52,800
We did a whole episode about war with grandpa, didn't we?

44
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:57,480
Yeah, we did do the whole episode about war with grandpa that nobody but that was maximum artifice

45
00:03:57,480 --> 00:04:01,080
So this is the other way around right? Oh, there's a minimum artifice

46
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:03,080
Yeah, I mean with this

47
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:08,840
Spring is here. Uh-huh. Shit. Yeah, bud. Now we have all of that. Yeah

48
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:15,880
Yeah, spring is here and that means one thing around these times this this neck of the woods time for spring cleaning

49
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:18,000
Okay, I'm gonna get out

50
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,720
Some of the parts of this podcast that are not working. Oh

51
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:24,200
them out

52
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:29,320
Dumpster. Yeah, and and you know, I don't know if we want no no there's you don't want to bring in new stuff

53
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:33,460
Why you're spring cleaning? You just want to clear out some of the cross. Yeah, there's let me see

54
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:40,960
Let me see. I got one that's I'm just immediately immediately. I'm gonna get one out. Okay, just let me crank it

55
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:43,060
Let me crank one out gross one

56
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:45,520
jam

57
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:50,320
So that was the last one of those they're done. I'm getting rid of in the spring cleaning

58
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:59,520
I'm getting rid of pretending like I'm ending munch squad. I'm not one squad. I'm getting rid of I'm sunsetting the bit where it's

59
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:03,960
It's final days. Okay, so net so that that bit is now

60
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:06,960
retired as they say on

61
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:09,640
Blank check we're hanging its Jersey

62
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:13,280
Yeah, me and Travis still make them jokes

63
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:22,600
About much. No, it's it's done. The continuity is done. Like it's important to reset continuity for our show, right?

64
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:29,800
So people knew new listeners aren't lost. So that's not a thing anymore. I don't say that sure

65
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:35,160
I'd like to get rid of something. It's just been bothering me for a while. Yeah the part of the show

66
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:42,520
And it's kind of like after we've made everything right, but yeah still talk for like another five minutes

67
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:47,600
Yeah before the I'd so I would like just get rid of the closing interesting

68
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:50,480
So I just want to end whatever the last thing is

69
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:55,360
So we say a joke right and we're like Kelsey Grammer's dick and then the mp3 stops

70
00:05:57,160 --> 00:06:00,000
Yeah, no, you know, I think we can leave the silence

71
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:06,480
Oh so that we don't get people like messaging us late. I think the got cut off right ever, right?

72
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:08,560
But we just I don't think we need

73
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:11,600
Closing stuff anymore. Okay, interesting

74
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:17,480
I'm gonna say this and this is a huge one and may actually be the most difficult one

75
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:25,080
To actually stick to and I this is not for the boys because I do not think I could muzzle them like this in

76
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:31,000
Good in good faith, but I am never going to say the word

77
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:34,720
Frazier again on this Wow

78
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:41,480
We're sunsetting Frazier and I'll there's a lot of our younger fans who I think are gonna be fully fucking stoked about that

79
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:44,120
Cuz they don't they don't know who this old

80
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:50,700
Northwestern fucking nosy Jagoff is his name's phrase

81
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:56,040
His name is a word. I won't be saying on the show anymore. Yeah

82
00:06:56,560 --> 00:07:02,680
And that's it. And that's it. Hey, can I just say Griffin that people are gonna think that that was a really good edit?

83
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:09,240
My Rachel right there. No, I caught it. That was just an amazing selfish. Yeah, it was very red and it was not intentional

84
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:11,240
I fully was about to say that

85
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:14,280
Northwestern gentleman's name. It sounded like it sounded

86
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:18,020
Computer clean. Yeah, good. That's all that it was. All right. I

87
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:24,040
One last thing that I do want to cut from the show. I just want to cut wherever we say the word this

88
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:30,580
Oh, I don't want to say that word anymore any of them and if we do we'll put a quarter in the jar

89
00:07:30,580 --> 00:07:35,860
Okay, that's gonna rack up pretty fast trap. Yeah, but then we'll spend that on ice cream

90
00:07:36,380 --> 00:07:40,700
Okay, we can keep doing all of our great bits like where we do stuff

91
00:07:40,700 --> 00:07:43,940
That's just for people to use on tik-tok, right that we do all the time

92
00:07:43,940 --> 00:07:49,900
But now you've fucked it up trap the possibly the whole show because now I'm going to be thinking

93
00:07:51,180 --> 00:07:57,820
Constantly for the rest of my life about that word and how I can avoid saying it about this. Yeah

94
00:07:57,820 --> 00:07:59,220
God

95
00:07:59,220 --> 00:08:01,220
Sorry, that's a quarter

96
00:08:01,860 --> 00:08:05,940
One of the things that I've seen a lot of people complain about I'd like to discuss sunsetting is

97
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:08,820
the very lengthy

98
00:08:09,100 --> 00:08:12,500
Introduction sequences. Oh, they're kind of rambly people complain

99
00:08:12,940 --> 00:08:15,820
Sometimes I've seen this you guys don't believe me, but it's true

100
00:08:15,820 --> 00:08:22,260
I've seen people complain about the fact that we don't do enough questions. Okay, is that I I'm not kidding

101
00:08:22,260 --> 00:08:25,780
I don't know if it's a problem or not. Like it doesn't bother me

102
00:08:25,780 --> 00:08:27,260
because

103
00:08:27,260 --> 00:08:31,740
They know we've been doing this for like 11 years, right? We've answered basically everything

104
00:08:31,740 --> 00:08:37,700
It's thought starters and also nobody has new problems. They just have same problem want to leave

105
00:08:38,220 --> 00:08:39,500
tired of

106
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:45,420
This time what you leave the person they want to ask out has blue hair instead of like red hair or whatever

107
00:08:45,420 --> 00:08:47,420
But it's all the same

108
00:08:47,780 --> 00:08:49,740
Reductive. No, you're being reductive

109
00:08:49,740 --> 00:08:55,140
What I'm saying is everybody has same problem and it is brothers want to leave right?

110
00:08:55,140 --> 00:08:59,300
I want to do other else or how make friends

111
00:08:59,820 --> 00:09:01,820
No, you Travis. You're not

112
00:09:04,460 --> 00:09:09,900
The same wavelength as us fuck I guess I just am kind of an introvert and I've liked being inside. Oh

113
00:09:10,900 --> 00:09:13,220
you've been driven mad without the

114
00:09:13,940 --> 00:09:17,260
Travis without the the incredible power of people

115
00:09:18,260 --> 00:09:20,420
applauding for him Travis is withered into a

116
00:09:20,420 --> 00:09:26,740
Huh? Huh? Huh? He's like fucking Gary Oldman in Dracula when he has it fed. He's just lurking around

117
00:09:27,140 --> 00:09:31,300
He's like one of the little snot creatures in Ursula's lair in the little

118
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:39,340
Yeah, I be actually calls me a Tinkerbell for that very reason. Yeah without people applauding for me. I am dying

119
00:09:39,460 --> 00:09:41,460
Yeah. All right. Well

120
00:09:41,820 --> 00:09:44,740
Let's do it. Oh, thank you. Oh, yeah. Hooray for you

121
00:09:44,740 --> 00:09:50,820
So we're gonna do actual questions because this is how this is this is real, you know

122
00:09:51,220 --> 00:09:57,060
That's like 75 cents. By the way, what is you just said the THI word?

123
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:02,620
My partner and I are expecting our first baby in September congratulations

124
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:07,900
After our first midwife appointment, my wife asked me if I wanted to catch the baby at delivery

125
00:10:07,900 --> 00:10:15,220
Don't believe brothers. What is the best technique to catch my child and not experience a big? Oh, oopsie on day one? This is from

126
00:10:15,420 --> 00:10:17,700
Butterfingers Buckeye and Akron and pal

127
00:10:18,700 --> 00:10:20,700
You don't know listen

128
00:10:21,020 --> 00:10:27,040
Don't do it. Listen. I want to do it intra question an intro episode this year. We're here

129
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:29,040
we're gonna have a lot of fun and

130
00:10:29,580 --> 00:10:31,940
We're gonna have a lot of fun. You should probably just do it

131
00:10:31,940 --> 00:10:36,580
however, the very nice midwife says you should do it right when when dot was

132
00:10:36,580 --> 00:10:40,500
Born we did a scheduled c-section and all

133
00:10:41,420 --> 00:10:46,700
Morning as we were prepared for this at least three different medical professionals asked me

134
00:10:47,380 --> 00:10:54,300
When we remove the baby, yeah, do you want to watch and I said?

135
00:10:54,740 --> 00:10:56,740
At least three different times

136
00:10:57,260 --> 00:10:58,500
No

137
00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:00,380
Not on your life

138
00:11:00,380 --> 00:11:07,660
Yeah, then a fourth medical professional who failed to ask you that question got involved in the delivery

139
00:11:07,660 --> 00:11:15,660
Oh beans and when the baby was removed held it up to me like Rafiki did Simba and I was like put that thing away

140
00:11:18,060 --> 00:11:26,460
Down wipe it down. What are you doing? And here's the thing that you're not expecting Butterfingers Buckeye and Akron when a baby comes out

141
00:11:26,460 --> 00:11:34,260
They're gonna be a little blue and they look fucked up babies when they come out of shit fucked up man

142
00:11:34,260 --> 00:11:38,940
And oh, I'm looking at it going. Oh, no, and now I say not yet

143
00:11:38,940 --> 00:11:40,540
I would say my daughter dot but in that moment

144
00:11:40,540 --> 00:11:46,260
Oh, no, and the doctor and all the everybody else just kept saying like oh good color looks good

145
00:11:46,260 --> 00:11:48,620
No looks good. I don't like I think it's that's a good color

146
00:11:49,180 --> 00:11:54,300
Here's my point question asker. You're gonna have a lot on your mind. You don't want to be in there

147
00:11:54,300 --> 00:11:57,620
You're gonna have a lot on your mind. You don't want to be in there

148
00:11:57,620 --> 00:12:00,460
I mean you got to be in there and you got to be supportive but

149
00:12:00,980 --> 00:12:06,420
like I can't imagine like like imagine you're a major league baseball catcher and

150
00:12:06,980 --> 00:12:11,960
Also behind the pitcher. It's like some kind of monster. Yeah

151
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:15,780
There's a lot of stuff in that room that if you look at it

152
00:12:16,340 --> 00:12:21,940
It's gonna fuck you up pretty bad. And so you need to be you got to keep your head on a swivel in there

153
00:12:21,940 --> 00:12:29,400
I do not think catching. Well, okay, they're gonna have to catch this baby. So what's the best technique maybe some kind of kid?

154
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:35,140
Okay, you're gonna get seven other large people and a hula hoop with like some fabric stretched

155
00:12:35,140 --> 00:12:40,860
Oh, I love that cuz that can like catch people jumping out of windows if the building is on fire, right?

156
00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:45,200
So it surely can catch anybody ever actually seen that happen where they stretch out the big

157
00:12:45,300 --> 00:12:49,540
The big trampoline and then people jump out of the buildings and they catch them in the trampoline

158
00:12:49,540 --> 00:12:55,420
That's gotta happen, right? Don't say surely. Have you seen it happen? Have you seen it? I've seen it in cartoons

159
00:12:56,220 --> 00:13:01,180
Travis yeah, I'm talking about this. I see. I see mr. Game and watch do it, but that's a

160
00:13:01,700 --> 00:13:06,380
Any true to life, you know, if there's one thing that I remember from middle school what you're gonna want to do

161
00:13:07,340 --> 00:13:11,740
Get a little parachute attached to the baby ahead of time get some cushioning around it

162
00:13:11,740 --> 00:13:19,460
Yeah, right and so that way even if it falls from like a second story that cushioning that maybe you can like suspend it in the

163
00:13:19,460 --> 00:13:22,160
Middle of a structure with like some rubber bands. Here we go

164
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:28,220
Now Travis is building fucking a science fair project where you see how high up you can drop the egg from yes, exactly

165
00:13:28,220 --> 00:13:34,620
But with a baby you see so yeah, if we're not is that not what that test was supposed to be for?

166
00:13:35,580 --> 00:13:37,700
Prototype for this exact moment. Yeah

167
00:13:38,580 --> 00:13:42,860
Hey, can I do a yahoo? I'd love that. This one was like that whole time

168
00:13:42,860 --> 00:13:46,620
Justin didn't say anything about how he would catch a baby. Yeah, I'm not going to

169
00:13:46,620 --> 00:13:51,260
But think about how much great free time I'll have when y'all are in the court battle of your fucking lives

170
00:13:51,340 --> 00:13:57,980
Okay, but don't listen to us. You don't have to do any of that. Yeah. Oh, yeah, that's enough. That's enough to do it

171
00:13:58,580 --> 00:14:04,540
This one's sent in by Graham Roebuck. Thank you Graham. It's yahoo answers user good Vegeta who asks

172
00:14:05,940 --> 00:14:08,840
Should the NFL create a SuperDuper Bowl?

173
00:14:09,460 --> 00:14:14,720
If if the team who lost the Super Bowl had better regular season record than team who defeated them

174
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:17,660
They can ask for a SuperDuper Bowl rematch

175
00:14:17,980 --> 00:14:25,300
It's played in a special gigantic arena with lots more fans if the team with better regular season record doesn't want a challenge to rematch

176
00:14:25,300 --> 00:14:27,780
For SuperDuper Bowl out of belief. They would lose again

177
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:34,520
Then the next season they could use that challenge left over to claim a first seed playoff spot with first round by

178
00:14:34,980 --> 00:14:42,120
Interesting now, okay. I like the concept, but I don't think that they're executing it the way I would choose

179
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:47,580
I think a Super Bowl right you have the number one and number two teams, right and whoever wins

180
00:14:48,180 --> 00:14:56,180
Should then in the SuperDuper Bowl one team play against whoever they lost or like whoever lost and the third team

181
00:14:56,620 --> 00:15:02,860
Right now it's one team against two teams. Oh, that's great, right? So it's like, okay. Well you could beat that one team

182
00:15:02,900 --> 00:15:07,100
Let's see how far we can go with this and then no if they win

183
00:15:07,100 --> 00:15:13,460
We go to the SuperDuper Extra Mega Bowl right and that's one team versus three teams and you can see where I'm going right now

184
00:15:13,460 --> 00:15:15,900
Okay, let me hit you with a twist it

185
00:15:16,620 --> 00:15:24,640
Super Bowl who wins whoever won the last one right Tampa Bay. That's not right. Yeah, sure. Okay Bucks win, but then

186
00:15:25,380 --> 00:15:28,780
The Bucks have to compete against the winner of the World Series

187
00:15:29,100 --> 00:15:30,780
Okay from that year

188
00:15:30,780 --> 00:15:38,980
This is the SuperDuper Bowl where the winner the greatest of all the each of the sports gets to compete against the top

189
00:15:39,460 --> 00:15:42,740
Sportos, yeah for like athlete like athlete

190
00:15:43,580 --> 00:15:47,260
Compete in football or in baseball trivia, baby. Oh

191
00:15:48,300 --> 00:15:53,220
I'm meeting of them. I know I'm in flat-footed. Do you see I like oh boy

192
00:15:53,220 --> 00:15:56,420
I like if we did it wwm by we I mean

193
00:15:56,420 --> 00:16:00,280
the National Football League of which I am NOT a

194
00:16:00,980 --> 00:16:02,180
representative

195
00:16:02,180 --> 00:16:06,300
but I would I think the NFL should follow the WWE and

196
00:16:06,940 --> 00:16:12,420
How they do it where they do the the money in the bank and whoever grabs the briefcase

197
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:18,980
They can exchange that to fight the champ right then and there whenever the fuck they bring the briefcase in

198
00:16:18,980 --> 00:16:20,980
So I don't know what this is the all-star game

199
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:26,500
Whoever wins the all-star game can like immediately after the Super Bowl the confetti is flying

200
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:30,560
They're lifting Tom Brady up my shoulders and he's you know

201
00:16:31,340 --> 00:16:33,660
He's he's thinking about fucking a mattress

202
00:16:33,660 --> 00:16:40,180
He's doing his whole thing that he fucking does and then but you hear not so fast

203
00:16:40,180 --> 00:16:47,420
and it's the all-star team and they get to they get to do it now and that's a great strategy because the

204
00:16:47,420 --> 00:16:49,420
Buccaneers are so tired

205
00:16:49,420 --> 00:16:54,740
I'm gonna take it and turn it just a little bit Griffin. Okay, so the Buccaneers have just won, right?

206
00:16:54,740 --> 00:16:57,740
I'm Brady. I want everyone shoulders think about fucking a mattress, right?

207
00:16:58,340 --> 00:17:02,660
Then not so fast. Who's that? It's the dark Buccaneers. Oh

208
00:17:04,100 --> 00:17:10,380
It's like they're exact replicas right they have to beat their clones. I love this. Yeah, I always love this, right?

209
00:17:10,380 --> 00:17:14,700
It's the best part of like any video game where you have to fight yourself and like you move to the right and they move

210
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:17,380
To the left. That's what I'm talking. That's good. Yeah, that's good

211
00:17:17,380 --> 00:17:23,940
Or we could just go Final Fantasy 7 style where after the after they lift up Tom Brady up on his shoulders

212
00:17:23,940 --> 00:17:29,900
He's thinking about having a good sex with a mattress and they're celebrating but then he looks back on the field and he says set

213
00:17:29,900 --> 00:17:35,060
Me down and he slowly walks back out on the field where the Kansas City Chiefs

214
00:17:35,780 --> 00:17:37,780
quarterback Patrick Mahomes

215
00:17:37,860 --> 00:17:44,500
This is there and he's shirtless and we do it Sephiroth style where if you really want to win the Super Bowl

216
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:51,180
You really want to win the Super Bowl? We settled this one-on-one quarterback versus quarterback

217
00:17:51,180 --> 00:17:55,620
Yeah, you beyond QB street ball just like we used to play where one quarterback

218
00:17:56,740 --> 00:17:58,940
Everybody's got giant heads throws it to

219
00:17:59,420 --> 00:18:03,140
To just throws it down the street and then you run and just try to grab okay

220
00:18:03,140 --> 00:18:05,140
They have to pick someone from the crowd

221
00:18:05,740 --> 00:18:12,300
Okay, so that way, you know, it's like this is all about quarterback skill. Yeah, right. We're just gonna pick because okay

222
00:18:12,300 --> 00:18:16,820
Oh, here's the thing. Sometimes when the Super Bowl is done, right? The quarterbacks get a lot of credit

223
00:18:16,820 --> 00:18:22,940
I feel so empty after the Super Bowl is done, right? No, I was here before the next Super Bowl. Fuck

224
00:18:22,940 --> 00:18:26,660
Yeah, I was bad for like the other members of the team, right?

225
00:18:26,660 --> 00:18:31,080
Cuz the quarterback gets so much credit. So when the Super Bowl is done, we switch quarterbacks

226
00:18:31,080 --> 00:18:37,100
We play again exact same game. We swapped quarterbacks. Now. We see how this game goes, right?

227
00:18:37,100 --> 00:18:39,880
I'm still gonna probably reflexively pass to their guys

228
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:41,840
well

229
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:44,360
Okay, we okay now

230
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:53,080
The quarterbacks are gonna rotate to safety and everybody else is gonna move up one spot. We play again. Okay, right?

231
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:55,960
That's maybe it's punter

232
00:18:55,960 --> 00:18:58,680
I don't want to downplay cuz I couldn't do any of them

233
00:18:58,680 --> 00:19:02,400
But there has to be a like and you're at this end

234
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:07,840
There's somebody on that team who's there's got to be somebody on every team in the major sports

235
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:13,480
Who sucks shit, but they just hoping like man. I hope I don't go in. Yeah

236
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:18,960
That's good. That was me in every sport. I ever played up to this point. I'm just happy to be here

237
00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:21,560
We solved it. Yep

238
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:28,080
That was an easy one. Yeah, I wish they were all but all slid down that smoothly because it normally there's a little bit more

239
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:33,480
Of a challenge. Um, can I so real quick? This isn't really a question, but I you know, I I go through the

240
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:37,000
the the emails and from time to time

241
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:42,920
I think it's important to do just a little PSA here folks about getting your question on the show. Yeah, and

242
00:19:43,560 --> 00:19:50,960
This this question stuck out to me. Okay, I will read the body of the email and then I will read the subject line

243
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:55,120
The body of the email reads title says it all

244
00:19:55,120 --> 00:20:03,080
Thanks brothers wet and wild in Alberta. Okay, and then the subject line is how do I stay dry at the dentist?

245
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:09,400
Yeah, that's a good that's it because you've now it's a mystery a puzzle box

246
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:16,560
For us to try and crack open. I would argue here question asker. The title does not quite say it all

247
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:18,640
No, there's definitely a lot

248
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:23,600
There's a lot left unsaid here. Yeah, maybe a little too much room for us to play

249
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:25,660
I would say a little bit

250
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:33,600
Too loosey-goosey here with how one might be getting a little wet and wild at the dentist. Yeah, that's not great

251
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:35,600
That's not a place where?

252
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:37,960
Moisture of any kind is acceptable

253
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:43,480
No, cuz you they you put it it goes up the tube that it sucks it out fast

254
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:47,640
Do you guys wish you have one of those just going in your mouth all day? Yes

255
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:54,440
Yes, I'll never forget. I was a child at the dentist and one of the the dental hygienist

256
00:20:54,840 --> 00:21:00,000
Cleaning my teeth said aloud you are the spittiest kid I've ever worked on

257
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:06,720
And that is a thing that's really stuck with me over the years. Yeah one spitty kid

258
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:14,200
Yeah, and I think a comment like that offhandedly delivered by a professional. It's the kind of thing that shapes a young man

259
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:17,600
That's somebody who would know yeah

260
00:21:18,120 --> 00:21:25,800
Like a stranger. Yeah, there's somebody who would know it's really stuck with me my housemate, and I have recently been getting more into puzzles

261
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:36,000
One time I was at a weekend murder mystery Ravenwood Castle and now extinct shadow stalkers

262
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:39,880
Murder mystery

263
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:41,920
crew and

264
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:46,200
They do murder mysteries, and there was one guy there who of his own

265
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,400
volition

266
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:53,520
He decided he would style himself as a puzzle master. Uh-huh and he would

267
00:21:54,440 --> 00:22:01,760
Not through the organizers know of the event. He was sort of like a rogue puzzle master

268
00:22:02,280 --> 00:22:06,320
God, I miss these fucking things. It was like it was my my Bonnaroo

269
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:13,120
So they made himself a rogue puzzle master, and he would just stand up and announce. I have more puzzles

270
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:18,440
And they were good. They were good. Were you there for that guy? Yeah? He was there the

271
00:22:19,040 --> 00:22:20,800
One I loved it

272
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:26,320
Fucking the greatest it's the greatest thing on the world turn out dude worked at the meat counter at Kroger

273
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:30,520
Fantastic, and he and he gets his one week. It'd be a puzzle master grace

274
00:22:30,520 --> 00:22:34,920
Can he hook it he sees that opportunity yes loved it?

275
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:35,920
it

276
00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:42,360
Puzzles how he would say every time and it made me excited about puzzle sure I that was my favorite thing about going to those

277
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:47,980
Things Justin because the people seizing the opportunities like that person who with no affiliation to the organizers

278
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:52,040
Dresses the werewolf and scared people in the woods. So it's just a werewolf and ran around the woods

279
00:22:52,040 --> 00:22:54,720
Yeah, he just wanted to do that scare the shit out of me one time

280
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:58,920
I was at the murder mystery shadow stalkers, and someone stood up dressed as

281
00:22:58,920 --> 00:23:05,560
um Johnny Depp pirate Jack Captain Jack Sparrow yeah, and um his name was Dave

282
00:23:05,560 --> 00:23:10,680
I think and he stood up and I noticed that he'd been there a few murder mysteries in that exact same costume

283
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:13,880
And then he stood up at the last day of the murder mystery

284
00:23:13,880 --> 00:23:18,640
Everybody has to stand up without their costumes on and say who they really are and he stood up

285
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:26,080
And he was still dressed as Johnny Depp pirate. He said I have come to realize that Dave is the costume

286
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:28,400
Huh fuck. Yeah, yes

287
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:34,720
Yeah, go live your life reclaim Captain Jack Sparrow you are Batman

288
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:41,400
We are it's a reclamation project. We're taking him back. You can't have him Johnny

289
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:47,000
We're taking back Captain Jack Sparrow time. We see weirdly photorealistic

290
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:50,720
Johnny Depp at the end of the Pirates of the Caribbean ride out Walt Disney

291
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:56,940
I do there is a part of me that recoils slightly like anymore. You're taking it back. Now. He's Dave

292
00:23:57,080 --> 00:24:02,420
There was a point in history where people like I hear Johnny Depp sometimes sneaks on to and appears on it

293
00:24:02,420 --> 00:24:05,480
And it was said in a much different way than it would be said now

294
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:15,360
Johnny Depp sneaks on to the Pirates of the Caribbean

295
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:21,440
Okay, so we put together a really rad thousand piecer of a bunch of colorful scoops of ice cream

296
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:24,080
I took a lot of effort over the week or so now

297
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:27,120
It's just chilling out taking a good half of our coffee table

298
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:31,560
How long do we keep it assembled before we undo all our hard work and throw it back in the box?

299
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:38,080
What's the proper amount of time to bask in our accomplishments versus maybe wanting the surface area back? That's from Pittsburgh puzzlers

300
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:45,520
Okay, this is I totally understand this question because you have kind of like if if you don't do it right away

301
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:53,480
Which is so disheartening which can really destroy your coverage. Then it's like how long is enough to take?

302
00:24:53,480 --> 00:24:55,160
Are you I?

303
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:57,160
have this feeling

304
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:59,560
Are either of you the type of person that would like?

305
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:04,480
She'll lack a puzzle. You have a little puzzle glue buy some puzzle glue

306
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:09,000
No amount and like frame it cuz you're never in a million because the glue eventually

307
00:25:09,720 --> 00:25:13,840
Will also wear off and the puzzle will it will erode?

308
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:20,480
I I would instantly take apart the putt you've wasted your time right making a puzzle is a waste of time

309
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:26,360
But you've wasted the time in the way you choose and there's fucking power in that right?

310
00:25:26,360 --> 00:25:29,120
Yeah, I've decided I'm gonna waste my time exactly like this

311
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:32,640
I'm gonna make a picture of ice cream. No one likes and then when you're done with it

312
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:37,600
you know what you do you spit the face of mortality and say and now I'm going to take it apart because I can because

313
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:41,480
I'm alive and I'm a human being and I'm gonna disassemble it there right back in the fucking box

314
00:25:41,480 --> 00:25:47,760
Just go ahead and burn my time. I want you should be allowed to fucking destroy. There should be instructions on the box

315
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:54,640
I put it together and once it's done look at it for one uninterrupted minute and then put it down the fucking garbage

316
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:58,400
Disposal, baby. Yeah, throw it up in the air

317
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:02,800
Can you imagine the satisfaction of throwing the air and then just punching right through the whole shit? Oh my god

318
00:26:03,280 --> 00:26:07,440
You've earned it better yet charge somebody to come do that

319
00:26:08,120 --> 00:26:11,160
Cuz oh, that's true and then say like hey

320
00:26:11,160 --> 00:26:16,520
Do you want like have the feeling of honest-to-god like destroying five hours of my life?

321
00:26:17,080 --> 00:26:19,600
Here you go, but $25, right?

322
00:26:20,520 --> 00:26:24,280
$25 and then you can use that on your next puzzle. This is what I'm saying

323
00:26:24,280 --> 00:26:29,720
Okay, now it's a gig economy and that's how we keep things going. You know what? I mean your jobs creator now

324
00:26:29,720 --> 00:26:31,720
I am here from puzzler

325
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:33,720
There's no you or II

326
00:26:34,160 --> 00:26:39,640
It's just puzzler. Yeah, and I'm here to destroy your puzzle. I want to destroy something beautiful. Ah, yes, right this way

327
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:43,520
We made it

328
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:49,960
Used to look like this it used to be many smaller pieces of ice cream picture. Do you want me to?

329
00:26:49,960 --> 00:26:55,840
Do the lights any certain way or no, thank you. I would like you to would you mind leaving the room you leave the room?

330
00:26:55,840 --> 00:27:00,800
Oh, you don't want me to watch? No, no, no. No, I'm not one of those. No, no, no, that's not really my thing

331
00:27:01,160 --> 00:27:07,760
No shade, but like I really I I just want to take it apart piece by piece one by one

332
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:09,720
Oh, sorry, just before you leave

333
00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:14,520
Are you ever gonna want to put this together or is it okay if I just eat a few or does that bother you?

334
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:17,520
Six or seven. I'm never gonna put it together. Yeah, okay

335
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:19,520
I imagine recently the same puzzle. Oh

336
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:24,720
I can't remember what it looks like. Are you kidding me? It's right here on the box Bob Bob stop

337
00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:31,200
What are you doing? I can't do this with kids our age like the kids there

338
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:35,800
If it's not a one-shot if it's not something I finish in one night, there's no point

339
00:27:35,800 --> 00:27:40,680
I can leave it in the highest cabin. Yeah, it's all a shelf and they would sense it and destroy it

340
00:27:40,680 --> 00:27:41,960
Yeah, here's the thing that I learned

341
00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:44,080
I used to do puzzles a lot and then I realized

342
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:49,560
I could just like print pictures off the internet if I wanted to look at ice cream. Yeah, and it was done way faster

343
00:27:50,280 --> 00:27:56,400
Yeah, or you think now I knit which is like putting together a puzzle that can keep you warm

344
00:27:56,680 --> 00:28:01,960
You can't do that with like a jigsaw puzzle you could try but people will laugh at you

345
00:28:01,960 --> 00:28:07,120
Do they have jigsaw puzzles that turn that are useful at the end? Wouldn't that be cool? Yeah

346
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:09,120
I guess it's kind of Ikea

347
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:11,120
Yeah

348
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:14,480

355

They've rethought every detail. I'm wearing a pair right now

356
00:28:56,620 --> 00:29:03,380
I love the kind of hexagonal support in the middle the no seam on the toe, but that's not it

357
00:29:03,580 --> 00:29:07,140
I'll tell you my favorite thing about it. They do more than keep your feet cozy

411
00:33:18,440 --> 00:33:25,480
Pringles this is I'm gonna I want to start covering NFTs in more detail. This is not about NFTs

412
00:33:26,280 --> 00:33:27,800
NFTs are

413
00:33:27,800 --> 00:33:33,800
They're like unique unique tokens that you could trade online like poach among cards, but they're bad for the planet

414
00:33:33,800 --> 00:33:40,960
They because I use a lot of resources. I'm and Pringles launching NFT along with Taco Bell. Are they real I?

415
00:33:41,520 --> 00:33:44,080
I've kept myself. I'm actually not gonna do that

416
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:47,200
Okay, I'm not I'm actually not gonna listen to like planet money or something

417
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:53,280
But the first response to Pringles launching their NFT is from someone just said the planet is dying Pringles

418
00:33:53,280 --> 00:33:58,280
Oh

419
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:01,280
So this news in

420
00:34:01,880 --> 00:34:07,020
Pringles has plucked a new flavor from the far reaches of the gaming world

421
00:34:07,520 --> 00:34:10,640
answering a question pondered by many Halo fans

422
00:34:11,360 --> 00:34:17,840
What what a moa burger tastes like? I don't know that is okay. So Griff you I've played Halo

423
00:34:17,840 --> 00:34:23,200
You've played all the halos you co-founded a video gaming website covered video games for 10 15 years

424
00:34:23,200 --> 00:34:27,280
However long it's been you don't know you don't know what a moa is

425
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:32,480
This is the wildest pull I've ever seen for a video game crossover product

426
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:38,320
This is Pringles wavy moa burger now a moa is the big

427
00:34:39,080 --> 00:34:42,880
flightless bird like creatures with two legs wings

428
00:34:43,600 --> 00:34:46,280
scales from the neck up and a lizard like head

429
00:34:46,280 --> 00:34:51,120
Similar to the extinct bird from New Zealand of the same name

430
00:34:51,200 --> 00:34:58,120
So just to double-check what the lead on this story would have us believe is that one?

431
00:34:58,320 --> 00:34:59,840
Anybody remembers the name of that?

432
00:34:59,840 --> 00:35:07,640
But two whilst playing the game and seeing said a large road with scales and whatnot their thought was wonder what that tastes like

433
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:12,240
For those not fluent in the video game halos lore moa

434
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:16,960
or like I said the bird is native to the halo planet called reach and

435
00:35:17,160 --> 00:35:21,320
Is the signature dish of a restaurant chain in that unit fuck?

436
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:29,080
Just give me a Master Chief burger. I'm an idiot. Give me a Master Chief burger with Cortana sauce. I'm a fucking idiot

437
00:35:30,200 --> 00:35:34,960
The bird is native to the halo planet reach and the signature dish of a restaurant chain in that universe

438
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:43,720
So the gaming community is continually curious about what moa might taste like in burger form. Really? This is like the longest

439
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:52,040
Fucking walk ever and what's wild column halo chips is there was supposed to be a new halo game

440
00:35:52,040 --> 00:35:57,560
And now there's not and the only thing that makes sense is that Pringles had already made all the chips

441
00:35:57,560 --> 00:36:02,760
Yeah, they're like listen. We can't wait for them to finish the new halo game. They should

442
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:04,640
Do it fail

443
00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:09,520
We have to make the even more insane play. I'm just releasing these chips

444
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:13,120
Nothing for no reason

445
00:36:14,560 --> 00:36:17,140
Through Pringles exclusive partnership with halo

446
00:36:18,160 --> 00:36:25,080
The new moa burger flavor brings the food item from the halo universe to life with an interstellar twist on the much enjoyed

447
00:36:25,400 --> 00:36:28,520
Sometimes written and often misunderstood moa bird

448
00:36:28,520 --> 00:36:34,720
This bird is based on a real bird that went extinct in New Zealand and now you can eat it

449
00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:37,940
All right. This is so good in a pretty nice Pringles

450
00:36:37,940 --> 00:36:44,720
I always there is not a paragraph in here explaining why it doesn't just taste like burger. I'm gonna lose it

451
00:36:44,720 --> 00:36:48,760
I'll hit you with that. Listen, they did a baconator. They know what they're doing. They're experts

452
00:36:48,760 --> 00:36:50,480
No, but this is what I'm saying. It's like

453
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:53,840
Okay, go on. Go on. Thank you. I'm just mad Justin

454
00:36:53,840 --> 00:36:58,760
I'm just a little verse has one of the greatest fan bases within the gaming world. Okay

455
00:36:58,760 --> 00:37:04,440
So we had to create a flavor that would deliver on a taste fans could previously only imagine

456
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:10,400
The famous moa burger, but isn't that what any taste in halo it right?

457
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:17,160
Like hey, I don't know what anything in halo tastes like Gareth McGuire senior director of marketing for Pringles. This is nothing

458
00:37:17,160 --> 00:37:19,160
Yeah, but none of it's anything

459
00:37:19,160 --> 00:37:24,280
Even us gamers on this podcast don't know what you're fucking talking about

460
00:37:24,280 --> 00:37:28,600
Yeah, I've learned more about what it would be like to lick master chiefs helmet

461
00:37:28,600 --> 00:37:34,680
Yeah, they're gonna eat that or the inside of it. Check this out. Let me flip this into a successful business plan

462
00:37:34,720 --> 00:37:35,720
Let me flip it

463
00:37:35,720 --> 00:37:37,040
We have taken

464
00:37:37,040 --> 00:37:43,760
We have extracted the DNA of the extinct moa bird and put it into a chip so that you can eat it to know what this

465
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:45,680
long dead animal tastes like

466
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:50,760
That's awesome because that opens the door to Pringles immortality

467
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:53,960
Like when I when I die, don't roll me up and smoke me

468
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:56,960
Turn me into a potato slurry mash

469
00:37:58,120 --> 00:38:04,800
Slice that baby up into delicious crisps extrude them and shot me down. Oh, I miss Griffin

470
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:06,800
He died 500 years ago, but

471
00:38:08,360 --> 00:38:12,520
Mmm taste him on the Pringle. That's the technology

472
00:38:12,520 --> 00:38:19,080
In case you're curious they deliver a bowl crunch because they're wavy feature a blend of flavors including garlic

473
00:38:19,520 --> 00:38:21,520
sweet ginger and

474
00:38:21,560 --> 00:38:22,800
savory beef

475
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:30,920
Okay, each bite finishes with a craveable slight heat from chili pepper and red pepper that will take taste buds on a journey to new

476
00:38:30,920 --> 00:38:32,920
star system

477
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:39,920
Gareth said we pride ourselves in creating an insanely accurate flavor combination

478
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:45,880
This is a fun one to develop while moa burger has a flavor that appeals to everyone

479
00:38:45,880 --> 00:38:51,600
We expect this to be enjoyed and maybe even collected by Halo fans. Oh boy

480
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:53,600
Got a

481
00:38:53,600 --> 00:39:00,560
Sometime this segment guys. Sometimes this one goes down. They're only at Walmart Pringles tweeted about them on March 3rd and

482
00:39:02,240 --> 00:39:06,600
I got some replies for you guys to the tweet. I got some replies

483
00:39:06,600 --> 00:39:11,520
I'm just gonna read some of the replies to the tweet about the chips the new chips that are only at Walmart and based on

484
00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:15,800
The space man bird. I'm having some but after eating too many it gets really hot

485
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:22,920
What help please help me help me Master Chief them holding the chip as if maybe you were doubting it

486
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:28,560
See, I feel like there's two types of people in this world people who play Halo and people who shop at Walmart

487
00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:30,560
And there's not much overlap between the two

488
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:35,400
I would argue quite a few. Halo players shop at Walmart

489
00:39:35,400 --> 00:39:41,680
It's not even a judgment call just stay with a fact a lot of people shop at Walmart and a lot of people play Halo

490
00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:48,200
The chance that there's not much of an overlap is a small right are these in Canada too?

491
00:39:49,240 --> 00:39:54,680
Unfortunately says Pringles. Yes limited time product is only available in the US

492
00:39:55,520 --> 00:39:58,240
Come on. I want to I wanted to try them out

493
00:39:58,240 --> 00:40:05,160
It tastes so awesome. Please. Let us keep them then Walmart says thanks Vic. Glad you like it

494
00:40:05,880 --> 00:40:07,880
Anyway, I'm Walmart

495
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:15,200
I'm 350 billion market cap Walmart just responding to your tweet about the space chip with it with an

496
00:40:16,240 --> 00:40:21,960
Unenthusiastic and non-committal answer I might add. Thanks. No, but I said can I keep them? Okay. Thanks, dude

497
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:24,400
Please please I need this

498
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:32,300
Oh, thank you Pringles. You saved my life. Please don't ever get rid of them. Wow. This is pickle eye Joe says

499
00:40:33,080 --> 00:40:40,460
Delicious, then Pringle says there's a high probability your taste buds will enjoy reaching capital are

500
00:40:41,080 --> 00:40:48,720
Reaching new heights with moa burgers Pringles. See you at Walmart pickle eye Joe rioters burned down my Walmart. Whoa

501
00:40:48,720 --> 00:40:50,720
Oh

502
00:40:56,400 --> 00:41:02,240
Just a quick note Steve next time don't engage with pickle eye Joe we we learned that a long time ago

503
00:41:02,240 --> 00:41:10,600
Yeah, our first time with pickle eye Joe, but I will thumbs up and then Pringle says you're about to witness the newest Pringles flavor

504
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:17,000
Plucked from the far reaches of the Halo verse run don't walk to your nearest Walmart or will kill you

505
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:21,340
Kid skull says already got some very yum and Pringles response

506
00:41:21,900 --> 00:41:28,520
Congratulations, you are among the very few so far who have taken their taste buds to new galaxies by trying Pringles Moa burger

507
00:41:28,680 --> 00:41:32,300
Then kids call says I glad you guys are still kicking around in 25

508
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:35,000
Awesome

509
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:40,040
It's just rice says are they at every store. I'm pretty sure we've established it just at Walmart

510
00:41:40,280 --> 00:41:42,560
Jake says can I order them online? Nope

511
00:41:42,560 --> 00:41:44,560
Cago

512
00:41:45,640 --> 00:41:49,640
Available in Poland, I don't know. Do you got Walmart's there? Are you America?

513
00:41:49,640 --> 00:41:53,880
I've been surprised by the answer with others. So I'll just ask are these vegan?

514
00:41:54,520 --> 00:41:56,520
This they're not big. Oh, they're not

515
00:41:57,200 --> 00:42:02,640
They got moa. They got moa flakes in them. They're wicked not vegan super not vegan. They got moa

516
00:42:03,200 --> 00:42:08,920
Has anyone has anyone tweeted? I want moa them. Oh, that's good trap. Thank you

517
00:42:08,920 --> 00:42:13,960
I'm a professional comedy person. Yeah. Um, hey, can I do that Yahoo now?

518
00:42:14,560 --> 00:42:16,680
Are there more incredible tweets about this?

519
00:42:19,560 --> 00:42:24,520
Because I'm excited about this one several people have said it and thanks everybody's Yahoo answers user Jake who asks

520
00:42:25,120 --> 00:42:28,440
in the category entertainment and music music rap and hip-hop

521
00:42:29,380 --> 00:42:33,520
Should we get rid of the calendars and dates and just go with the flow?

522
00:42:35,680 --> 00:42:37,340
So

523
00:42:37,340 --> 00:42:39,560
Rad that yeah kicks

524
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:48,280
Man, it's tough for me to even feign enthusiasm because I feel like how we wouldn't be recording right now. Oh my god Griffin

525
00:42:48,280 --> 00:42:49,720
You're so uptight

526
00:42:49,720 --> 00:42:55,720
Wait, you're afraid of missing doctor's appointments. Just go to the doctor when your body needs it. You know what I mean? Okay

527
00:42:55,720 --> 00:42:58,280
This is oh, what's that? You're late for brunch

528
00:42:58,560 --> 00:43:04,680
No, you'll get to brunch when it's time for you to have brunch and maybe your friend will be there and maybe they won't

529
00:43:04,680 --> 00:43:11,120
You know what? I mean? Maybe I was late to my job interview Derek because I wasn't ready to be interviewed

530
00:43:11,120 --> 00:43:16,460
Yeah, you know what? I mean dad. Yeah. Hey, I don't feel like going to college today dad

531
00:43:16,880 --> 00:43:22,020
You're just a rock in the middle of the flow while I am a leaf. I'm a leaf

532
00:43:22,240 --> 00:43:26,000
I'm traveling down the way the river. Can I borrow 20 bucks?

533
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:35,000
Give me $20. I just need it for Pringles. Give me $20 now because I don't really do time

534
00:43:35,960 --> 00:43:41,200
So that's not the linear sense that you're sort of into so I need that right now

535
00:43:41,200 --> 00:43:47,960
I'm just saying what does it matter if you think it's Monday, and I think it's Wednesday if you give me $20

536
00:43:47,960 --> 00:43:54,240
Yeah, I mean like what's it? What's it really matter if I cleaned my room when I'm really stoned

537
00:43:54,240 --> 00:44:01,160
We're gonna have to restructure society. I feel like to pull this off. No jobs. No school. Okay, no doctor's appointments

538
00:44:01,160 --> 00:44:06,780
What's other things use no birthdays? No trains, right? So like no birthdays no holidays

539
00:44:07,320 --> 00:44:09,320
It's just there is

540
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:11,480
now

541
00:44:11,480 --> 00:44:16,360
There is now. Okay. Now you're talking to me. Yeah. Yeah, this is so good

542
00:44:16,360 --> 00:44:22,940
And that would be dope. That would be so rad for us because then like we could just like release episodes

543
00:44:22,940 --> 00:44:27,420
when it's when they are needing to be

544
00:44:28,380 --> 00:44:32,780
Released when we have one in us to make it and not

545
00:44:33,780 --> 00:44:34,940
immediately

546
00:44:34,940 --> 00:44:36,140
after

547
00:44:36,140 --> 00:44:39,060
Doing a very very long the adventure zone record

548
00:44:41,060 --> 00:44:47,740
We would just feel it and fucking do it now that would be a fun way to explain to someone why you didn't like pay

549
00:44:47,740 --> 00:44:49,040
your bills

550
00:44:49,040 --> 00:44:55,140
Hey, I noticed you're late on this am I or perhaps the bill did not need to be paid. There would be no bills

551
00:44:55,140 --> 00:44:56,860
Oh, okay, right, right, right

552
00:44:56,860 --> 00:45:01,860
Cuz when because we're all just going with the flow people who make the electricity and bring it to your house

553
00:45:01,860 --> 00:45:09,140
We'll come knock on your door and say it's time and then you'll give them whatever money that you have. Oh, that's great

554
00:45:09,140 --> 00:45:13,640
They'll make the energy to give to me and I have I don't know grown some wheat or something

555
00:45:13,640 --> 00:45:16,580
So I'll give them the energy they brought

556
00:45:16,580 --> 00:45:23,320
I'm like, right and then you say you're gonna want to cook that for one hour and then they'll say

557
00:45:23,820 --> 00:45:29,580
What's an hour because there's no time so cooking things is gonna get pretty fucked up pretty bad

558
00:45:29,620 --> 00:45:35,540
So only raw foods, which is good cuz that's what we should be doing. Anyway, how raw though Griffin

559
00:45:35,860 --> 00:45:39,500
Raw raw raw what? Okay question

560
00:45:40,260 --> 00:45:43,220
Sunday morning is the day that I clean the house. Okay

561
00:45:43,220 --> 00:45:48,780
So how will I know when house dirty house got dirt on start? Do you clean it?

562
00:45:50,780 --> 00:45:53,700
An alarm for when to take a shit. Yeah

563
00:45:54,860 --> 00:45:57,540
No, no, you do and your body tells you to now

564
00:45:57,540 --> 00:45:59,460
You just gotta wait for a house to tell you to clean it

565
00:45:59,460 --> 00:46:03,380
Like your house is your bowels and the cleaning is the shit and everybody's body

566
00:46:03,620 --> 00:46:08,540
does have a point where they look around at their environment and just goes and

567
00:46:08,940 --> 00:46:12,700
That's when that's when yeah, that's when you take a shit

568
00:46:12,700 --> 00:46:17,340
Yeah, well now do you set an alarm for when it's time to wake up? Um

569
00:46:18,020 --> 00:46:22,180
Yeah, I did. No, I actually don't do that cuz my stupid body won't let me sleep

570
00:46:22,180 --> 00:46:26,020
Ah, it's like your body knows better than Oh, mr. Clock over there, huh?

571
00:46:26,020 --> 00:46:30,740
So my body's going with the flow, but I haven't enjoyed that. Oh, I kind of wish it would rated it

572
00:46:30,740 --> 00:46:37,660
Hey, what if we went the opposite way and nobody went with the flow and we just scheduled everything. No fucking flow. Yeah, that's great

573
00:46:37,660 --> 00:46:43,220
I'm just saying like now like you do have a time when you're allowed to take a shit and if you miss it

574
00:46:43,380 --> 00:46:45,380
Too bad, you know what? I mean?

575
00:46:45,860 --> 00:46:50,720
Now it is like an extra super duper preachy episode of Star Trek the next generation

576
00:46:51,380 --> 00:46:55,180
Where it's like they're about to kiss and somebody comes up and it's like no

577
00:46:55,940 --> 00:47:00,160
Kissing time's over. It is not kissing time. And then it's like but love

578
00:47:00,900 --> 00:47:04,780
You can't put a time schedule on you can't make love

579
00:47:04,780 --> 00:47:10,820
Well, if you guys kiss we're gonna kill Wesley. That's right. Wesley did a kiss during hug time

580
00:47:10,820 --> 00:47:16,700
So he's fucking dead now because we killed him. And as soon as murder time rolls around he's out of here

581
00:47:16,700 --> 00:47:19,460
He's done so. You're lucky we only murder on Fridays

582
00:47:19,460 --> 00:47:23,060
Ah shit guys if we get rid of dates and calendars you just go with the flow

583
00:47:23,060 --> 00:47:26,700
How are we supposed to know when the purge is? Oh, man, that's true

584
00:47:26,700 --> 00:47:29,620
You'll just you'll go up and hit someone in the head with a sledgehammer

585
00:47:29,620 --> 00:47:34,620
And then someone's like not yet. Yeah, you go to jail. You're like fuck that wasn't it

586
00:47:34,620 --> 00:47:39,420
I had but then you could just walk out of jail because there's no such thing as jail sentences. Oh, yeah, that's right

587
00:47:39,420 --> 00:47:42,940
How long do I have to be in here? Oh, uh, we haven't thought of that. Yeah, I didn't

588
00:47:46,100 --> 00:47:51,000
So I was at work one day with another co-worker it was really slow so we were talking about sharing stories

589
00:47:51,620 --> 00:47:57,380
Talking and sharing stories. She got a customer right after telling me something super personal

590
00:47:57,380 --> 00:48:03,060
She ended it with don't tell anyone. I told you that you're the only one in this whole state. I've told

591
00:48:03,700 --> 00:48:05,700
Problem is I zone the fuck out

592
00:48:05,700 --> 00:48:12,100
She was talking and I didn't hear anything that she said since then she brought it up again saying that thing

593
00:48:12,100 --> 00:48:16,780
I told you before. What do I do? Oh boy. That's from awful co-worker and

594
00:48:17,580 --> 00:48:24,640
Alaska and I think this is great. Oh, I think this is wonderful. Go on. Okay

595
00:48:24,640 --> 00:48:31,440
Okay, I'm going to tell you the person on the other end of this question

596
00:48:32,200 --> 00:48:35,980
She got to unload the thing that has been bothering her

597
00:48:36,600 --> 00:48:37,800
you

598
00:48:37,800 --> 00:48:40,880
Have now that but that information is very sensitive

599
00:48:41,760 --> 00:48:49,080
You have now become like a cryptocurrency cold wallet at this point. Okay that data is

600
00:48:49,920 --> 00:48:52,280
fucking archived and locked down

601
00:48:52,280 --> 00:48:54,280
beyond all

602
00:48:55,120 --> 00:48:58,000
Blockchain on the blockchain now

603
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:04,820
You can't get the block chain of your rudeness is what it's all right, and that's great. Yeah

604
00:49:06,200 --> 00:49:13,720
Sometimes people do have to say sometimes people do tell you things because they do they are looking for a source of commiseration

605
00:49:14,640 --> 00:49:20,760
but it is also like a heavy load sometimes and they're gonna be worried that you'll let it slip and

606
00:49:20,760 --> 00:49:28,040
And they all they don't have to because it can't slip it won't slip. Yeah, it's not even technically there

607
00:49:28,040 --> 00:49:30,040
It's not there. That's awesome

608
00:49:30,120 --> 00:49:36,800
Now if you did want to figure it out, is there a way to do that? Other than hey, just so you know, I

609
00:49:37,640 --> 00:49:43,800
Wasn't really listening to her that super sensitive thing that you've only told me damn it. Why didn't you fucking listen?

610
00:49:43,800 --> 00:49:50,240
Fuck you should listen. Hey Griffin. You sound like my brain ten times a day. Yeah

611
00:49:50,920 --> 00:49:52,640
Really? You should have listened to their net

612
00:49:52,640 --> 00:49:55,760
Sometimes my brain does that when I'm meeting somebody and they're like hi

613
00:49:55,760 --> 00:50:02,200
I'm and my brains like pay attention, but the brain is so loud saying that that I don't actually hear the name

614
00:50:02,440 --> 00:50:09,160
Yeah, and you're looking I'm thinking like I'm listening so hard right now. Yeah shit. I'm doing such a good job listening. Oh, no

615
00:50:09,920 --> 00:50:11,640
Yeah

616
00:50:11,640 --> 00:50:12,920
Sure

617
00:50:12,920 --> 00:50:17,160
Okay, I'm gonna give you a script. So I've been thinking about what you told me, you know the thing

618
00:50:17,160 --> 00:50:20,160
Oh, yeah, the thing that I don't want you to tell anybody ever you've been carrying

619
00:50:20,160 --> 00:50:27,680
Yeah, exactly even carrying around the burden that for so long and I read about an exercise in time a leadership magazine that I subscribe

620
00:50:27,680 --> 00:50:29,680
to leadership

621
00:50:30,080 --> 00:50:32,400
Monthly actually, oh, it's I don't think it's good

622
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:37,160
So I doesn't say is that today with the ever-changing leadership techniques, but go on

623
00:50:37,160 --> 00:50:43,160
What what you do is you write the thing down on a scrap of paper, okay, and then you fold it

624
00:50:43,160 --> 00:50:45,480
And then I'll go burn it for you

625
00:50:45,960 --> 00:50:53,440
When you're not around, okay, and that way you'll be free of the burden. I have really bad handwriting. Is that a problem?

626
00:50:53,880 --> 00:50:55,880
It's like it's like not even legible

627
00:50:56,440 --> 00:51:00,880
Can you put it on Google Drive as I'm worried about a secure thing?

628
00:51:00,880 --> 00:51:05,760
Do you have like any kind of like a typewriter I can use do you how much do you know about the blockchain?

629
00:51:05,760 --> 00:51:07,760
Oh, I know quite a bit

630
00:51:07,840 --> 00:51:09,840
Shit, okay

631
00:51:10,560 --> 00:51:16,040
