1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:30,800
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:46,080
Hello everybody, welcome, my brother, my brother,

6
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:50,320
and me at Advice Show for the Modron Era. I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy.

7
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:52,640
I'm your middle-est brother, Travis McElroy.

8
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:57,520
And I'm your new year's baby and sweet 30 under 31, Griffith McElroy.

9
00:00:57,520 --> 00:00:59,840
It's- we're more Modron than ever.

10
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:03,360
Oh yeah, baby, we're in those sci-fi years now.

11
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:05,600
It's the most Modron we've ever been.

12
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:08,800
People say we weren't gonna make it, and we did.

13
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:09,280
Looks like we made it.

14
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:10,320
Who the fuck said that?

15
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:12,320
A lot of naysayers.

16
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:12,960
Point them out.

17
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:13,920
Name them one by one.

18
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:14,560
Name names.

19
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:16,000
Alan Alda.

20
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:17,920
Alan Alda said that?

21
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:21,600
Damn, I don't want to burn Alan Alda, but if he's talking a bunch of shit about

22
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:23,680
our ability to make it, then-

23
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:26,000
Yeah, he doubted us, and I guess we showed him.

24
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,400
You know what? It buzzed me out especially because I just talked to him a week ago,

25
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:32,800
and he's like, I always said you guys would make it.

26
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:34,960
That's the two-timing. That's the thing.

27
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:41,840
Wow, you know, way to start 2018 off on a bad foot to find out that Alan Alda is a two-faced

28
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:42,640
son of a gun.

29
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:51,120
I feel a little at sea though, gentlemen, because we are in a new year, and yet in a sense we aren't.

30
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:53,920
In a sense we are still in a sort of limbo.

31
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:54,560
Yes.

32
00:01:54,560 --> 00:02:03,360
Because we have not sort of thematically found what this year is going to be about.

33
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:05,840
So we've had a lot of people tweeting at us.

34
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:09,120
And I'm not sure that they've necessarily helped us.

35
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:17,120
If only anything, they've added more C by giving us a billion very good suggestions

36
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:18,240
of what the year should be.

37
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:23,520
And just listen, I can't stress enough how much I appreciate the participation which

38
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:25,120
everyone has put forth.

39
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:30,480
But rhyming teen with things is easy and could apply to any year.

40
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:34,880
So serpentine works because it's like 17, but serpentine.

41
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,040
Even that was a stretch.

42
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:38,240
I think we can all agree.

43
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:43,200
You can't just say like 28 clean because that could be anything.

44
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:44,960
Like that could be this year or next year.

45
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:46,400
I guess 2020 would have-

46
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:48,080
I wanted to float one.

47
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:51,040
And we agree that 2020 is going to be looking forward.

48
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:53,600
But that's not what 2020 means, but sure.

49
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:55,760
Clear vision.

50
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:03,200
I want to float this one because we didn't talk about last time, but I think it's powerful.

51
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:07,600
I think it has power and it is 2018.

52
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:12,960
And it's like the Black Eyed Peas song, but it's obviously it's been 10 years.

53
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:15,200
10 years since that tune.

54
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:17,200
And we're all really looking forward to the anniversary.

55
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:18,320
I don't think I speak for-

56
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:18,960
Yeah.

57
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:19,840
I think I speak for all of us.

58
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:27,200
The reunion, they're going to blow the horn of Gondor and the peas will get back together

59
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:27,680
in the same way.

60
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:31,760
When William and Taboo and Ferguson-

61
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:33,200
Ferguson and-

62
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:40,240
Here's one from Percival Press who says, 20 trampoline, time to bounce back.

63
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:44,960
Now, when you sent that one in, did you know that you were going to change my life on a

64
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:46,240
personal spiritual level?

65
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:51,440
Because maybe this is the year we get specific about it and it's like, this is it.

66
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:53,520
Go buy a fucking trampoline and get hot.

67
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:57,440
20 trampoline, higher and higher.

68
00:03:57,440 --> 00:03:58,320
Now, here's the thing though-

69
00:03:58,320 --> 00:04:02,880
Now, I will say, I did just say that this is just rhyming the teen part.

70
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:03,680
Shh, shh, shh, shh.

71
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:04,000
Okay.

72
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:04,800
No, no, no, no.

73
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:07,120
2018, we're going fishing.

74
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:08,960
Who's that?

75
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:10,000
Tyler Petty says 2018.

76
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:15,280
No, it sounds like a literal, like literally going fishing or is this like catfishing?

77
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:18,720
I think a lot of parts of fishing seem chill to me.

78
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:20,720
The one I can't do-

79
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:22,000
I'll fuck up a worm.

80
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,280
I don't care.

81
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:25,360
But when the fish is on the hook-

82
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:25,840
Too big.

83
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:26,080
That's-

84
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:28,240
I can't close that deal.

85
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:30,560
What do I do with this slimy fella?

86
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:31,520
It's a big worm.

87
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:35,760
If you think about maybe it's a big worm with eyes and mouth, it'll help.

88
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:36,960
But no, it won't.

89
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:40,320
And I can convince myself that that worm has done some shit.

90
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:41,200
You know what I mean?

91
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:43,840
But like, I look at a fish and I'm like, that fish has never-

92
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:44,800
It didn't do nothing.

93
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:45,440
A soul.

94
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:46,960
It's never done anything wrong.

95
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:50,480
Might be somebody's grandpa with a bunch of stories that got dropped down in the water,

96
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:52,800
transfigurized.

97
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:53,040
Right.

98
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:54,480
Or it could be Don Knotts.

99
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:55,920
You never know.

100
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:56,720
Most fishes are.

101
00:04:58,480 --> 00:05:02,880
Also, there's obviously people are going to take that one and run with it in a sort of

102
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:04,480
masturbatory direction.

103
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:10,720
And that's its own can of worms to continue talking about worms.

104
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:12,160
Can we go there just one step further?

105
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:14,800
Do we already talk about 20 Master 18?

106
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:15,280
We should.

107
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:17,200
20 Master 18 is achievable.

108
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:22,000
Easily achievable, I would say.

109
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:23,840
I want to try to avoid-

110
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:27,360
What I liked about Serpentine is it's very personal.

111
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:29,200
And I think that we want to-

112
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:33,760
I don't want any that could be easily disappointing.

113
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:35,600
Like, which one was building bridges?

114
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:37,200
2016 building bridges.

115
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:43,280
Okay, that required actually two people on either end to sort of like get it done.

116
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:45,440
You know, nobody builds a bridge from one end and then-

117
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:46,080
But that's good.

118
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:53,440
I would argue that we need to move back in that direction as opposed to having more years

119
00:05:53,440 --> 00:06:01,440
about, you know, individual distrust of the system and almost Neil Breen-esque distrust

120
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:02,240
of the system.

121
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:06,320
And more of like where we can get-

122
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:11,520
I'm just, guys, I can't get away from this image of two horses getting doubly strong

123
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:16,080
or triply strong because of their friendship pulling this big cart we call life.

124
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:24,080
A few people have suggested 20 Gayteen, which I love, except for it is phonetically

125
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:27,520
indistinguishable from 20 Gate-teen.

126
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:32,560
And I don't want people to think that we're kind of putting up barriers.

127
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:34,400
Now, I like this one from Warrior Princess.

128
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:38,080
He suggested 20 Blade-teen the year of Wesley Snipes.

129
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:42,000
Once again, specific.

130
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,840
That's some specificity.

131
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:46,560
Everybody can get into Wesley Snipes this year.

132
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:52,560
Also 20 Slayteen, but that could break bad pretty fast, I think.

133
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:55,280
Yeah, that's the problem with a lot of these.

134
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:59,680
Yeah, apparently 8 rhymes with a lot of sort of, I mean, hate.

135
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:04,240
Like, it rhymes with a lot of words that I don't think we want to make the sort of-

136
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:07,280
20 Skate-teen, bringing back rollerblades.

137
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:10,560
20 Skate-teen, back from the brink.

138
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:13,120
20 Skate-teen, back from the brink.

139
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:16,880
I feel like I'm really fucking good at coming up with the subtitles and really bad at coming

140
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:17,920
up with the year names.

141
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:26,000
Now, somebody, because we did talk about Mount Up, and somebody suggested 20 Regulate-teen,

142
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,520
and I'm sorry that I can't remember.

143
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:28,320
Or just Regulate-teen.

144
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:31,600
No, we got, I mean, we got a billion people saying, like, how could you not say Regulate-teen

145
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:33,600
after saying Mount Up as much as you did?

146
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:33,920
Yes.

147
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:37,920
And I don't know that that's the right spirit of the thing.

148
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:38,960
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

149
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:41,760
I have one that I'm very enthusiastic about.

150
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:42,080
Okay.

151
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:47,520
Because I can't, like I said, the horses, that's very much our thing.

152
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:51,200
Pulling carts, working together, friendship, love.

153
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:56,720
Last episode, or last non-live episode, I suggested 20 Mate-teen, stronger together.

154
00:07:56,720 --> 00:08:01,840
And we got a lot of tweets from people concerned about 20 Mate-teen being sort of the thing,

155
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:05,680
because it sounds like almost a Paul Ryan-esque sort of challenge to increase.

156
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:08,400
I did mention that specifically in the moment.

157
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:09,200
I believe yes.

158
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:11,440
So how about this?

159
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:12,720
And we've gotten this from a lot of people.

160
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:15,040
I can't claim credit for it, but I think it's kind of great.

161
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:18,560
Collaborate-teen, stronger together.

162
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:20,400
Because that can mean anything.

163
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:25,040
That just means two hearts, two minds, two souls, or more.

164
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:25,600
Many souls, many different minds.

165
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:29,200
It is important to me, Griffin, that it does not mean anything.

166
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:34,800
It has to, we need to give it some sort of boundaries, I think, for it to be an effective,

167
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:36,400
I do like Collaborate-teen.

168
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:37,520
Well, that's it, that's it.

169
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:42,160
It could mean like creatively, if you have a thing that you want to do that you struggled

170
00:08:42,160 --> 00:08:44,560
with or been hesitant to do, get somebody else.

171
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:48,080
A like-minded individual on board who can help you fulfill your dreams.

172
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:52,560
It can also mean like get involved with something that's important to you.

173
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:56,240
Maybe let's go fucking rain fire down on the midterm elections.

174
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:59,440
Just a fucking biblical reckoning on those, on them shits.

175
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:01,200
I'm very into that.

176
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:02,880
Collaborate-teen, we're stronger together.

177
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:06,960
You're strong alone, but we're stronger together.

178
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:13,600
It could be collaborating as far as like, as Griffin said, creativity or like social

179
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:16,720
action, but it could also be like accountability.

180
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:17,520
You know what I mean?

181
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:23,200
Like having a friend that keeps you on track of your writing project while you keep, not

182
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:28,160
necessarily working together so much as just like that, like horse working across the-

183
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:29,520
It is necessarily working together.

184
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:30,000
It is.

185
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:30,720
But that's what I'm saying.

186
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:33,520
It doesn't have to be working together on the same project so much as it could be working

187
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:35,920
together to help one of you finish something.

188
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:39,360
To help one another become stronger, validate one another.

189
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:40,800
Validate-teen.

190
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:42,640
Validate-teen's pretty good.

191
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:43,440
Validate-teen's pretty good.

192
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:47,200
From John, who says, navigate-teen.

193
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:48,160
All hands on deck.

194
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:51,120
I love that.

195
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:51,920
I love sailing.

196
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:54,640
I love nautical, that sort of vibe.

197
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:56,160
What are we navigating though?

198
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:57,600
Just life's choppy waters?

199
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:59,040
Just navigating it.

200
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:00,560
We're just navigating it.

201
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:02,640
This big blue spaceship we call Earth.

202
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:11,360
Listen, I'm willing to throw my hat over the fence, my weight throwing-

203
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:13,840
Why did you just throw a hat at collaborate-teen?

204
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:18,240
I don't know, but I'm willing to throw my support behind collaborate-teen.

205
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:21,760
I think that's my huckleberry.

206
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:26,240
Because not only do I like the spirit of it, I also like that we wouldn't have to say 20

207
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:28,080
at the beginning of it every time.

208
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:28,720
Yeah.

209
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:30,400
Which I think is a little played.

210
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:36,880
A little played at this point, and we're gonna keep doing it for the next, what, in 82 years?

211
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:42,080
And then when 2,118 rolls around, we can just do it again.

212
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:45,360
Yeah, so I think collaborate-teen, stronger together.

213
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:49,840
And then just the picture of a bunch of horses pulling the world out of orbit.

214
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:54,320
Yes, maybe pulling it so that global warming's not an issue anymore.

215
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:55,920
Pulling it away from the sun.

216
00:10:55,920 --> 00:11:00,560
Yeah, we moved one degree over, one centimeter out of our orbit.

217
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:02,560
That's how we're gonna fix this whole thing.

218
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:04,320
Just get a little bit further away from the sun.

219
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:06,720
Not very far, but just a little bit further.

220
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:11,440
Which I actually think will give us like one more day a year that's just like a rest day.

221
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:11,760
Yeah.

222
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:14,720
I actually think that that's a future Rama plot now that I'm thinking about it.

223
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:17,280
But anyway, stronger together.

224
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:20,000
Justin, do we have a consensus?

225
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:26,080
I just want to make sure we've thought about all the different things.

226
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:28,320
Well, hum a few more at us, big boy.

227
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:30,480
Do you guys know what spate means?

228
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:34,720
I don't, but I thought there might be something there.

229
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:36,640
I think it's like a fight.

230
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:39,600
No, that's a spat, isn't it?

231
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:44,720
Okay, spate is a large number of similar things or events

232
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:47,040
appearing or occurring in quick succession.

233
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:49,040
This is nothing.

234
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:49,840
That's nothing.

235
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:53,040
Okay, let me pitch one out that we did talk about earlier

236
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:56,480
that I wanted to give one more chance here.

237
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:56,800
Okay.

238
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:58,320
20 slates clean.

239
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:01,600
But I still have the same reservations about it

240
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:03,920
in that I don't want anybody to start over.

241
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:05,280
I don't want anybody to start over.

242
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:08,080
That's the sentiment that might have carried us into 2017.

243
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:09,920
We're like, boy, 2016 sucked.

244
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:11,360
2017 slates clean.

245
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:12,160
Let's do this thing.

246
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:16,400
And 2017 was like a dump and it dumped all over.

247
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:19,120
And then it was like, wow, I wish I hadn't had a clean slate.

248
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:24,880
I wish I'd had some of my experience points left over from the previous year

249
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:29,120
to help bolster me going into this new game plus.

250
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:30,960
2018, we're a little bit wiser.

251
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:34,400
Now we know it's time to, you know.

252
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:38,320
Is this collaborate teen or 20 collaborate teen?

253
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:41,040
20 collaborate teen is such a vicious mouthful.

254
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:43,040
It actually stung my mouth to say it.

255
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:44,480
I think collaborate teen.

256
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:46,240
But it's like-

257
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:48,560
Now what about, Justin, can I take your idea

258
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:50,080
and just put a little spin on it?

259
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:52,400
Sure, not my idea, but go on.

260
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:53,760
Blank slate teen.

261
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:56,160
And it's just all about the movie Blank Slate.

262
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:58,000
Let me hit you with this.

263
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,600
Blank check teen.

264
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:00,000
Uh-huh.

265
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:00,800
Uh-huh.

266
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:03,280
How about captivate teen?

267
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:04,000
Can't look away.

268
00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:05,520
From what?

269
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:09,920
Now, once again, that's a good turn of phrase, I guess,

270
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:13,360
but not super actionable as far as what to do this year.

271
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:15,680
Aspirate teen.

272
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:16,240
Just breathe.

273
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:19,040
No, aspirate is when you choke on your own vomit.

274
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:23,280
Well, yeah, but aspirate teen.

275
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:24,880
Fluoridate teen.

276
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:25,360
Nope.

277
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:26,400
Keep those teeth.

278
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:26,640
No.

279
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:28,160
Germinate teen.

280
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:29,840
Watch it grow.

281
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:31,040
Watch what grow?

282
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:35,200
This is the thing you keep referencing these arcane subjects.

283
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:39,040
Lubricate teen.

284
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:39,680
Get it wet.

285
00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:41,760
Jesus God, Justin.

286
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:42,640
Now hold on.

287
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,680
We might have something here.

288
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:46,400
Get what yet?

289
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:47,280
You might be wondering.

290
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:47,920
The year.

291
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:50,080
Get the year wet.

292
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:52,240
Just a sloppy, slimy year.

293
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:54,080
Machinate teen.

294
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:55,120
Watch the gears turn.

295
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:57,840
No, okay, once again, what does that mean?

296
00:13:59,040 --> 00:13:59,440
What?

297
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:01,200
It means devise a plan.

298
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:03,680
Devise a plan and watch the gears turn.

299
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:04,720
Watch it grow.

300
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:05,280
Get it wet.

301
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:07,760
Elucidate teen.

302
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:08,960
Becoming clear.

303
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:13,200
Wait, no, that makes it sound like we're becoming Scientologists.

304
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:14,560
Hey, maybe this is it.

305
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:15,440
Maybe this is the year.

306
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:16,000
This is the year.

307
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:17,840
Relocate teen.

308
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:21,200
2013, time to audit.

309
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:25,680
Is there something with like illuminate, but it's about Illuminati?

310
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:30,000
I mean, yeah, I mean, but that's literally all you just said and it wasn't much.

311
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:31,760
Okay, all right.

312
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:33,360
I think we've done our due diligence at this point.

313
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:36,320
Collaborate teen, I think, is the standout.

314
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:40,960
So I think we can officially say it at this point that this year,

315
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:47,360
the year of our Lord 2018, has been re-dubbed Collaborate teen.

316
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:49,440
And you don't gotta do this today.

317
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:54,240
Who is our Lord that was born 20,018 or whatever years ago?

318
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:56,160
What Lord are we referencing here?

319
00:14:57,280 --> 00:15:01,040
The one true Lord, Jesus of Nazareth.

320
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:02,000
Oh, wow.

321
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,920
Okay, I thought there was gonna be a joke in there.

322
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:05,680
There's no joke.

323
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:10,560
There's only Jesus of Nazareth, King of Kings and Lord of Lords.

324
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:12,720
The true Christian God.

325
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:15,520
A strange twist of a strange sort of, okay.

326
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:19,360
Is this our ICP twist?

327
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:19,920
Yeah.

328
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:22,000
The lamb, guys, the lamb.

329
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:24,320
The big one, the big guy.

330
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:25,760
So we should make it clear.

331
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:26,640
Jesus.

332
00:15:26,640 --> 00:15:29,040
Yeah, you don't gotta do this today.

333
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:30,320
Emmanuel.

334
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:31,520
Him, all right.

335
00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:33,360
You don't gotta do this right now.

336
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:37,200
I feel like that's the problem with our mottos is people are like,

337
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:40,880
it's January 2, I need to start zacking right now.

338
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:42,960
And you get burned out and you don't follow through.

339
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:44,000
It's just, think about it.

340
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:44,960
Think about what you could do.

341
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:47,120
That could be improved with the help of another person.

342
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:49,920
And how you can help them.

343
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:52,240
That's what it's all about.

344
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:54,160
This is how I see it working best, right?

345
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:57,760
This is how I think all of our years should be implemented moving forward.

346
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:03,280
I think that this is something that when you find yourself in a situation, right?

347
00:16:03,280 --> 00:16:08,800
Where you would normally say no, or you would normally do something by yourself,

348
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:10,320
or you would normally, whatever.

349
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:14,800
And I want you to hear in your head, collaborating.

350
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:15,520
Mm-hmm.

351
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:17,360
And you say, no, you know what?

352
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:18,400
I could use some help.

353
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:19,680
Thank you for asking.

354
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:20,720
Don't be afraid to reach out.

355
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:22,240
That's what I'm saying.

356
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:25,760
So like that, I don't want it to be like, okay, guess I gotta go.

357
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:27,040
I don't want you to have to feel that way.

358
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:28,560
You can if you want to.

359
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:31,360
But instead, I want this to be that little, you know,

360
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:36,080
the pebble in the stream that just changes the current a little bit for you.

361
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:37,040
Perfect.

362
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:37,360
Right?

363
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:43,680
That's how I think it is most actionable as a gentle guide to your year.

364
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:50,400
I would love to collaborate with you two, Jags, to do the podcast that we do sometimes.

365
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:51,280
Oh, okay.

366
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:52,400
Sheesh.

367
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:54,000
Kind of rushing it, but let's get into it.

368
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:54,960
It's been 20 minutes.

369
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:58,880
We take your questions and turn them back into wisdom.

370
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:01,040
It's an advice show, as you almost certainly guessed.

371
00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:05,440
My friend is kind of an awkward guy when he doesn't know how to reply in a text,

372
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:06,880
tweet, post, or chat.

373
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:08,800
He will throw in a random emoji.

374
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:12,000
I think he thinks it's funny, but it's not.

375
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:17,040
At best, it grinds the conversation to a halt and force the other person to pivot awkwardly

376
00:17:17,040 --> 00:17:18,720
because it doesn't make any sense.

377
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:21,760
At worst, the emoji he chooses end up being kind of insulting.

378
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:25,840
For instance, today I asked him would I should get a mutual friend for their birthday

379
00:17:25,840 --> 00:17:29,360
and he replied with a snoring emoji, which was super rude.

380
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:34,240
I told him off and he didn't get why I was mad because it was just a random choice for him.

381
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:37,760
How can I teach him the art of emoji use, or even better, get him to stop?

382
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:39,360
And that's from Exhausted by Emojis.

383
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:46,800
I think 2018, collaborate, stronger together, pull the world out of orbit is all very important.

384
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:51,200
But I would love to have sort of a secondary thing going on where we ban the use of the

385
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:55,200
word emoji and we try to find a different word for these little guys because-

386
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:56,320
Icons.

387
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:57,920
Icons is good.

388
00:17:57,920 --> 00:17:59,040
Face cons.

389
00:17:59,040 --> 00:18:00,160
Tiny pictures.

390
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:01,120
Tiny pics.

391
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:02,160
Little guys.

392
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:08,000
Are you worried because emojis sound so much like emotions that some people might be confused

393
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:12,400
that emojis is new teen slang for emotions as I was back in 2013?

394
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:13,040
Absolutely.

395
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
This is a, boy, what a-

396
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:16,880
I'll tell you the problem.

397
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:23,760
The problem here is clearly the emojis being chosen, excuse me, the tiny pics being chosen

398
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:25,200
are not random enough.

399
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,480
Like, what should we get our friend for a birthday?

400
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:32,800
You're going to want to use that little, like the cable car that hangs from the wire

401
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:36,240
that goes between Mountain Chalet and Switchwood, right?

402
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:37,120
That's random.

403
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:39,840
No one's ever going to get offended by Skytram car.

404
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:48,160
It drives me crazy when the keyboard on my iPhone tries to auto complete with a picture.

405
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:53,040
Like I type in bread and it meant like, did you mean a picture of bread?

406
00:18:53,040 --> 00:18:56,560
And it suggests that to me like, no, I actually didn't.

407
00:18:56,560 --> 00:19:01,840
I'm kind of 37 years old, so I'm just going to keep using words for now.

408
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:06,080
The last thing I want is the person on the receiving end of this shopping list to have

409
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:09,600
to solve a fucking rebus to know what I need from the store.

410
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:09,760
It's ridiculous.

411
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:11,040
And that is what this person-

412
00:19:11,040 --> 00:19:19,440
I get having social anxiety and even in sort of telecom scenarios, definitely.

413
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:23,440
Because my go-to is just not responding at all.

414
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:27,280
And I don't know what is worse in this situation, not responding

415
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:34,960
or responding with this sort of random sort of piece of art for them to interpret.

416
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:37,680
Because I think that's even a little bit more annoying than just like,

417
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:40,960
oh, well, Griffin's anxious and not responding to this.

418
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:46,640
My worldview on all this really shifted when I found out one of the emojis means dick.

419
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:51,600
And I think after that moment, I really had to start getting more careful.

420
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:56,080
I mean, you can't randomly choose emojis when one of them means penis.

421
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:57,200
And one means butt.

422
00:19:57,760 --> 00:20:00,400
Yeah, the peach one is a fanny.

423
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:06,960
So what I'm confused about is how Eggplant got picked for this and not the hot dog.

424
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:09,200
Did we have a vote?

425
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:10,800
I don't remember voting on this.

426
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:14,320
Is the hot dog emoji just a loose hot dog or is it not in a bun?

427
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:17,280
No, it's on a bun, but I mean, you get the idea.

428
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:20,560
I would have thought it'd be banana or a cucumber.

429
00:20:20,560 --> 00:20:23,760
The problem is hot dogs come up in conversation all the time.

430
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:25,600
I'm very rarely talking about eggplant,

431
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:31,120
but I can't have a conversation about ballpark snacks where people think that I'm being weird.

432
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:33,200
You want to go to the game and get a penis.

433
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:36,640
I guess the context does help there.

434
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:42,160
But I guess you don't really use the word eggplant as much as you use hot dog.

435
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:42,960
And that is me.

436
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:47,360
Unless you live in Italy and where they eat those dang little purple guys all the dang time.

437
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:53,200
And you think over there, people are texting just like, yo, why are you talking to your own mom about dick?

438
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:57,360
And it's like, no, it's about dinner tonight because we are eating an eggplant parmesan.

439
00:20:57,360 --> 00:21:01,680
It would also probably be a problem if you're just a huge fan of Captain N

440
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:02,880
and you're just like constantly recounting-

441
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:04,720
Jesus Christ, Travis.

442
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:05,200
What's wrong?

443
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:06,560
What happened, Griffin?

444
00:21:06,560 --> 00:21:11,680
It's just, that's a very obscure reference, my boy.

445
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:16,720
I would like to go back in time now and watch the Captain N cartoons

446
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:19,040
and think of King Eggplant.

447
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:19,760
What was he?

448
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:20,800
Eggplant Wizard.

449
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:22,400
Eggplant Wizard is a penis.

450
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:23,520
Yeah.

451
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:28,320
As a representative, excuse me, as a metaphor for a penis.

452
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:30,800
It's actually from Kid Icarus, which I get.

453
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:35,520
When you think look at it that way, it's an angel just blasting dongs nonstop,

454
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:41,120
which maybe that game had more sort of heavy religious undertones than we gave it credit for.

455
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:43,600
I actually think you guys, Kid Dicarus.

456
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:49,440
I really feel bad for Eggplant Wizard the day he found out about the whole penis thing.

457
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:51,680
Because that's like-

458
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:53,920
That's my whole brand.

459
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:55,920
Like his whole brand's kind of wrecked.

460
00:21:55,920 --> 00:22:00,720
He's got an eggplant like on the end of his staff.

461
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:02,320
Like that's ridiculous now.

462
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:06,240
And you know, there was probably a delay too where he was just like,

463
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:09,600
I don't know what this new surge in popularity has been.

464
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:10,160
What's that?

465
00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:13,680
Oh, well, I'm a penis now.

466
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:17,520
Shed a tear for the ice climbers who are climbing this whole dang mountain

467
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:21,360
when they get to the top to get the penis emoji at the top of it.

468
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:22,800
And they didn't own that.

469
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:24,000
That wasn't their choice.

470
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:28,080
So should we talk about something accessible?

471
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:28,720
Yes, please.

472
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:31,040
How about a Yahoo?

473
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:33,280
Yeah, that sounds good.

474
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:37,120
I need to tell you guys something about Yahoo right now on January 1st, 2018.

475
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:40,240
Um, it's fucked.

476
00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:46,720
The website is full-blown Y2K Colonel Panic fucked up bad.

477
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:49,760
Is this gonna be the year we lose it, you think?

478
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:59,920
If this is any indication, then the website has crossed the event horizon down the internet drain.

479
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:05,760
Because I'm looking at it now, all the elements on the page are aligned in a single column,

480
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:09,760
meaning they're all just on top of each other, meaning I can't read a lot of it.

481
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:11,440
Which was difficult.

482
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:14,320
I had to like pick questions that didn't have a lot of additional details.

483
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:17,360
Wait, and this was like all of the questions?

484
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:17,760
Everything.

485
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:18,400
The website.

486
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:19,520
It's fucking gone.

487
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:22,160
Y2K hit it 18 years late.

488
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:23,680
It's fucked up bad.

489
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:29,680
So I have a question here that I'm very drawn to because I can't read any of the additional

490
00:23:29,680 --> 00:23:31,200
details about it.

491
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:33,440
And with that in mind, I want to dive into this one.

492
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:34,240
Abby sent it in.

493
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:34,880
Thank you, Abby.

494
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:37,520
It's from, I don't know, it's covered up.

495
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:42,800
But it's asked by a person who's named, I'll call them Rinaldo, asks,

496
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:46,320
Can I eat twice at Denny's?

497
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:49,760
What does this mean?

498
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:53,360
Does this mean can I eat there twice in one week or twice in one day?

499
00:23:53,360 --> 00:24:02,320
Or how I like to interpret it, you've just ordered and completely eaten either on a dare

500
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:06,560
or voluntarily, you know, a Denny's egg mess.

501
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:09,920
And then they say, here's your check and you pay it.

502
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:12,240
And they bring it back and they say, all right, you have a nice day.

503
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:14,400
And you say, actually, hold on a minute.

504
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:16,160
I think I'd like to go again.

505
00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:16,400
Yeah.

506
00:24:17,040 --> 00:24:18,320
I think I'd like to go again.

507
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:22,160
And you can walk me back up to the host table and walk me back down to either this seat

508
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:23,760
or a different seat if you'd like to.

509
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:26,080
But I think I'd like to do a Denny's again.

510
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:28,000
Can I go one more again?

511
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,040
One more again, please.

512
00:24:29,040 --> 00:24:29,360
One more again?

513
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:32,960
I'm wondering why not just order two entrees in the same.

514
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:35,680
Nah, it's twice at the Denny's.

515
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:43,280
Bring me the check for round one and then let's fire it up again.

516
00:24:43,280 --> 00:24:44,080
And let's see.

517
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:48,400
And I want to compare and contrast, you know, certain elements of service.

518
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:52,480
I might, do you order the same dish again and just check their consistency?

519
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:58,960
Because at Denny's, when you get the egg mess, I imagine consistency is not

520
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:02,880
a top bullet point sort of strength there.

521
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:07,280
When you guys go out to eat and you order, right?

522
00:25:07,280 --> 00:25:12,320
And the server person takes away your menu.

523
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:19,440
Do you ever feel this moment of completely irrational panic when they take the menu away?

524
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:20,480
Every single time.

525
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:21,200
Every single time.

526
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:27,520
Especially if they have, this kills me, when they have a lot of fun cocktails in there.

527
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:29,440
Actually, I'm going to drink more.

528
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:31,840
So go ahead and leave that with the table place.

529
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:36,560
Or, you know, cool pictures of food and people eating them that I might just want to enjoy

530
00:25:36,560 --> 00:25:37,520
during my meal.

531
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:38,960
And recreate.

532
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:40,480
And recreate with my great friends.

533
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:44,720
Especially if they have a lengthy dessert section in the menu.

534
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:47,600
And I'm just like, but I don't know if I want that yet.

535
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:49,360
Okay, so we'll have that right out.

536
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:50,160
Let me grab your menus.

537
00:25:50,160 --> 00:25:55,360
Well, hold on a moment because I seem to have fallen in love with one of the people inside

538
00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:56,080
the menu.

539
00:25:56,080 --> 00:25:59,600
And I need to, I would love to have them here with me, dining with me.

540
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:01,920
I'm going to cut them out and Larsen the real girl them.

541
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:05,840
Do you have the contact info for your menu models?

542
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:11,440
Do you think it's because they don't want you to compare the pictures of the food?

543
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:14,000
That is definitely it, that's 100% it.

544
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:14,800
Absolutely.

545
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:19,040
I mean, if you should just accept that if you're eating at a restaurant with pictures

546
00:26:19,040 --> 00:26:22,000
of the food in the menu, it ain't going to look like that.

547
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:23,200
They're not going to get it right.

548
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:23,520
They're not going to do that good.

549
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:25,040
It's ironic, isn't it?

550
00:26:25,040 --> 00:26:25,440
Yeah.

551
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:25,920
It is.

552
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:28,880
They are always off-put when you're like, well, actually, I'm going to hold on.

553
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:29,760
Oh, you're going to.

554
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:30,960
Oh, okay.

555
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:33,920
Okay, well, I guess.

556
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:37,840
Okay, well, I'm going to have to check with my manager.

557
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:42,240
And here you'd need to because you need to plan for round two during round one.

558
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:44,320
I'd like to do Applebee's again.

559
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:50,480
They should really have enough menus for everybody to enjoy a menu while they're at the restaurant.

560
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:52,160
Why don't they have enough for everyone?

561
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:54,400
This one's mine.

562
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:57,280
You borrowed it to me for the entirety of my meal.

563
00:26:57,920 --> 00:26:58,880
Well, I'll tell you.

564
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:03,040
Before anybody tweets to this, having worked in the restaurant industry is because people

565
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:04,480
are horrible monsters.

566
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:09,280
And if you leave their menu with them, they will inevitably get food in it and stuff and

567
00:27:09,280 --> 00:27:10,240
ruin the menu.

568
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:12,080
That's why so many menus are laminated.

569
00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:14,240
But that's my fucking right.

570
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:17,040
That is my God-given right.

571
00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:18,240
Inalienable.

572
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:23,600
Given to me in the Bible to ruin the menus at the restaurants I go to.

573
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:24,320
What about this?

574
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:25,600
Print it off.

575
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:26,400
Piece of paper, right?

576
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:28,880
When you hand it to someone, when you sit them down at the table and you hand it to

577
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:30,560
them, you say, that's yours to keep.

578
00:27:30,560 --> 00:27:31,600
Yeah, yuck it up.

579
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:32,480
Here's yours.

580
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:33,680
Here's three crayons.

581
00:27:33,680 --> 00:27:34,960
It says Todd at the top.

582
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:35,760
That's yours.

583
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:37,120
Here's three crayons.

584
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:38,080
Have fun.

585
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:39,040
Go to town.

586
00:27:39,040 --> 00:27:41,600
And you know when you see kids menus that do do this.

587
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:44,320
Travis, by the way, you've just invented kids menus.

588
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:49,040
And you see them coloring on it and not really engaging in conversation with everybody else

589
00:27:49,040 --> 00:27:49,680
at the table.

590
00:27:49,680 --> 00:27:53,760
You know, you look at them like, damn, that looks fun.

591
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:55,760
Damn, that looks good.

592
00:27:55,760 --> 00:27:57,840
They got this whole activity there to do.

593
00:27:57,840 --> 00:27:59,600
Oh, I love, I love that activity.

594
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:02,400
I never doodle and I never do little jumbles.

595
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:04,080
I would love to do a jumble right now.

596
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:04,800
How good?

597
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:07,440
Talking about my, you know, my friend, how it's going at work.

598
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:12,240
How good would it be if people started like awkward dinner conversation and you looked

599
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:15,200
up like, uh, I'm halfway through my maze.

600
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:17,760
So just pump the brakes.

601
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:18,960
You're going to have to circle back.

602
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:22,240
A thing which I cannot do because I keep running into all these dead ends.

603
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:26,800
We're so off topic about double, double time.

604
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:28,160
Double food.

605
00:28:28,160 --> 00:28:28,880
Can you?

606
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:29,360
Yes.

607
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:30,000
Should you?

608
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:30,400
Yes.

609
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:31,120
Next question.

610
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:34,800
Can you, do you have to go to the back of the line?

611
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:38,320
Or can you, like, do you get preferential treatment because you're very, you're kind

612
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:39,200
of a repeat.

613
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:44,800
I feel like if there's a line long enough that you have to wait, you might talk yourself

614
00:28:44,800 --> 00:28:46,800
out of it while you're in the line.

615
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:52,240
I can't imagine how I would feel as a Denny's employee if a customer finished.

616
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:53,280
Oh, thank you very much.

617
00:28:53,280 --> 00:28:54,240
Oh, sorry, Bill.

618
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:54,720
Okay, great.

619
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:55,440
Thank you.

620
00:28:55,440 --> 00:29:01,440
Stood outside silently, but like mouthing the words counted to 60 and then walked back

621
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:04,080
in and said, like, one for Denny's, please.

622
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:05,920
Like, I think I just called the police.

623
00:29:06,800 --> 00:29:11,280
Yeah, for everybody in the situation, that would probably be the best sort of outcome.

624
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:16,560
Do you think Denny themselves would show up at that point and say, like, you've done

625
00:29:16,560 --> 00:29:18,000
it, you've solved my puzzle.

626
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:19,840
The Empire is yours.

627
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:21,840
Now you're in charge of Denny's.

628
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:25,920
You know, the story about the boy who got all of the Denny's he wanted.

629
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:29,040
Yeah, they get his stomach pumped.

630
00:29:29,040 --> 00:29:31,040
You didn't finish your first egg mess.

631
00:29:31,040 --> 00:29:32,080
You get nothing.

632
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:32,880
Good day, sir.

633
00:29:33,920 --> 00:29:38,240
My big worry would be that the freshest big boy would be watching from across the street.

634
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:39,680
Like, that's painful.

635
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:44,640
It hurt enough that you went one time over to Denny's, but he knows that you're full

636
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:44,880
now.

637
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:47,920
Like, you don't even want to come see what I have to offer.

638
00:29:47,920 --> 00:29:49,440
I thought I was your big boy.

639
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:51,200
I thought I was your big boy, you said.

640
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:53,600
You said I was your big boy.

641
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:57,600
The other night, I ripped my pants at a local bar.

642
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:01,760
That's not me, Justin, talking, although it very well could be.

643
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:05,440
Except for me being at a bar, I guess.

644
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:08,400
I stayed until the end of the event I was watching.

645
00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:11,200
How much do you have to rip your pants to leave immediately?

646
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:14,800
Is this a condition that you can, quote, pull off?

647
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:17,920
And that's from Split Decision in KC.

648
00:30:17,920 --> 00:30:18,720
Hmm.

649
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:24,160
Man, I don't want to get too Andy Rooney on it, but like, I've seen pants in all kinds

650
00:30:24,160 --> 00:30:29,840
of different states of both array and disarray, and just not question the fact that it was

651
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:33,440
like a legitimate style decision.

652
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:39,440
And so I feel like I'm not the best person to ask this question, but I do want to state

653
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:45,440
that right now, and last night at the New Year's Eve event, I am and was wearing my

654
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:48,480
ripped pants I ripped on an episode of My Brother, My Brother, and Me.

655
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:50,000
I can't let these things go.

656
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:50,480
I love them.

657
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:51,840
I'll never let go.

658
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:53,840
When did you tear them?

659
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:55,360
When he was trying to pull his pocket out.

660
00:30:55,360 --> 00:30:56,560
I was trying to pull my pocket out.

661
00:30:56,560 --> 00:31:01,040
I tore the pants, and this is a small hole, and I think that's acceptable.

662
00:31:01,040 --> 00:31:04,000
Although you can, if you look very closely, see me on these.

663
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:08,640
The question stands, how far would you have to rip your pants?

664
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:15,760
Rip your pants before just sitting down until you're done isn't an option.

665
00:31:15,760 --> 00:31:18,640
Well if it's on your butt, you can sit down for as long as you want, because that's where

666
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:19,760
the butt is.

667
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:23,120
I don't know if you know that, Trav, but the butt is on the back, and it's where the seat

668
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:23,120
goes.

669
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:24,560
That's a great point about where the butt is.

670
00:31:24,560 --> 00:31:25,760
That is where the butt is, you are right.

671
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:28,880
The butt's on the back, and that's also where a chair goes, so.

672
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:35,920
I think my pants would have to rip from my waistband above my butt all the way around

673
00:31:35,920 --> 00:31:38,160
to the waistband at the front.

674
00:31:38,160 --> 00:31:42,400
It's gonna have to, Travis is right, it's gonna have to be a logistical issue.

675
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:46,320
It's going to have to be a cold comfort issue.

676
00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:51,360
If it is no longer comfortable because you're letting too much of the elements outside,

677
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:57,920
inside, and your shit's not freshness locked, then I think it's probably time to get up

678
00:31:57,920 --> 00:31:58,320
and go.

679
00:31:59,040 --> 00:32:01,360
Right, if they've become chaps.

680
00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:02,000
Yes.

681
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:05,520
If at any point they become chaps and you didn't make that decision before you left

682
00:32:05,520 --> 00:32:09,840
the house, then it's probably time to get in the car and go home.

683
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:13,760
You know, I was actually thinking about this because, like, now since having a baby and

684
00:32:13,760 --> 00:32:18,080
carrying around a diaper bag that has, like, changes of clothing and stuff in it, I thought

685
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:21,120
about, like, why do we ever give that up?

686
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:26,000
Like, why do we ever give up, like, having a backpack that's just like, yeah, at any

687
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:30,720
given time, I have another pair of pants and another shirt in there, just like, whenever.

688
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:32,800
Right?

689
00:32:32,800 --> 00:32:36,480
Like, my life becomes way more rough and tumble the older I get, it seems.

690
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:37,680
Does it?

691
00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:38,480
No.

692
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:39,920
What's going on?

693
00:32:39,920 --> 00:32:42,160
No, come on, you can't just say a bunch of shit.

694
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:46,000
I eat a lot of strawberries and I just can't really do them, you know?

695
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:51,200
All right, so Travis is a big yucky brown bear just making a mess in the brambleberry patch.

696
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:54,320
This is not the first time we've had a question about someone ripping their pants.

697
00:32:54,320 --> 00:32:55,760
I'm like, what do I do now?

698
00:32:55,760 --> 00:32:58,720
And the thing is, I understand this because this happened to me once when I was working

699
00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:04,560
at Best Buy, and I ripped my khakis, and I had this moment of like, well, here I am.

700
00:33:04,560 --> 00:33:09,440
Well, then let me suggest this, instead of a backpack you carry around everywhere, which

701
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:12,880
that's an issue, because somebody's like, uh-oh, Travis's backpack looks a little bit

702
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:15,680
thinner, so I'm wondering what happened.

703
00:33:15,680 --> 00:33:20,960
They're going to assume it was a dookie mistake, and you don't maybe necessarily want to own

704
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:21,200
that.

705
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:23,680
Instead of that, a backpack that you carry around everywhere, because a lot of places

706
00:33:23,680 --> 00:33:27,360
won't let you in with a backpack, because they think you're a thief, and they won't

707
00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:28,720
say that to your face, but I will.

708
00:33:29,680 --> 00:33:35,520
Instead of a backpack, what about a series of dead drops located in some of your most

709
00:33:35,520 --> 00:33:36,800
frequent haunts?

710
00:33:36,800 --> 00:33:42,480
So your local bar's a great place for this, because local bar dookie mistakes probably

711
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:44,080
aren't even the number one thing here.

712
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:46,080
There's drink spills.

713
00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:47,440
Drink spilled.

714
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:50,400
Nacho cheese whoopsies, maybe, perhaps.

715
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:53,120
Some escaped cherry from some sort of beverage.

716
00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:57,760
Oh, the bartender was doing a frickin' trick, and the cherries went and landed right on

717
00:33:57,760 --> 00:34:04,000
your pants, and it makes it look like a nasty stain, and so you go to the dead drop that

718
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:08,240
you have in the bathroom duct taped to the back of the toilet chamber, like in Godfather,

719
00:34:08,240 --> 00:34:12,800
but instead of pulling a revolver out that you'll use to kill two men, you pull out just

720
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:13,840
new pants.

721
00:34:13,840 --> 00:34:15,520
That you use to kill two men.

722
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:16,400
No, no, no.

723
00:34:16,400 --> 00:34:17,280
Oh, no, no.

724
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:18,000
No, wait, sorry.

725
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:21,200
Don't kill with your pants.

726
00:34:21,200 --> 00:34:21,920
This is my work.

727
00:34:21,920 --> 00:34:29,280
This is my place, and then under this one particular box of this one, you know, household

728
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:35,280
device that I know nobody ever uses, nobody's ever gonna buy one of these things, this jalopy,

729
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:38,560
it's just full of new pants that I can use in case of a stain.

730
00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:43,840
If I was gonna do it, I would do this for underwear, because I think that the odds of

731
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:46,960
me ruining underwear are immensely higher.

732
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:48,960
Well, they're the first line of defense, right?

733
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:55,840
Right, they're the 300 phalanx protecting the captain of pants.

734
00:34:55,840 --> 00:35:01,280
I think it would ease a lot of anxiety on my part if I knew that if my day was sort

735
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:07,440
of run a little long, and I needed a little get up and go, the ability to just throw on

736
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:13,840
some clean undies, I think would be huge for just my whole mental state.

737
00:35:13,840 --> 00:35:17,120
Oh, okay, I'm gonna pitch this, because this is what I think I would both need and

738
00:35:17,120 --> 00:35:22,160
appreciate it most. From now on, whenever I attend some sort of convention, I'm gonna

739
00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:28,480
duct tape a fresh pair of me undies and socks somewhere in the convention for next year,

740
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:30,320
and then I'll just know that they're there.

741
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:38,240
I mean, why fucking stop there? New undies, new socks, a, like, nourishing face mask that

742
00:35:38,240 --> 00:35:43,120
you can just, like, get in the toilet stall and just, like, plop that on, and a little,

743
00:35:43,120 --> 00:35:47,280
maybe, like, a little, you know, five-hour energy drink, or actually something that is

744
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:48,880
good, something good equivalent.

745
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:50,000
Like a bottle of water?

746
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:54,080
A bottle of water that you can use to just sort of freshen up, and then you come out,

747
00:35:54,080 --> 00:35:58,800
and you're just a new person. Hello! How's it, wow, you seem, what's, must've had a great

748
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:04,320
bathroom trip. You could say that. Are you talking about a big shit you took? I don't

749
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:05,840
know. I'll never tell.

750
00:36:05,840 --> 00:36:08,320
Why are you winking at the camera? Don't worry about it.

751
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:08,880
Don't worry about it.

752
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:09,440
Wink, wink!

753
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:11,840
Care package secured. Wink.

754
00:36:11,840 --> 00:36:13,040
Self-care package.

755
00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:14,080
Self-care package.

756
00:36:14,080 --> 00:36:14,800
That's what we call it.

757
00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:16,240
Now, at this point-

758
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:20,000
Where would you guys hide? Where would you guys hide? We're all pretty homebodies at

759
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:24,240
this point in our life trajectories. Where would you drop your dead drop?

760
00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:24,880
Upstairs.

761
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:26,160
That's a bad-

762
00:36:27,840 --> 00:36:31,600
What a lot of flexibility that would give to my day, huh? Don't you think?

763
00:36:31,600 --> 00:36:38,320
Whoa, look out. I don't know, probably, like, in the CVG airport. I tend to be there a lot,

764
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:38,720
like, in the max and almost.

765
00:36:38,720 --> 00:36:44,000
That airport is such a- Oh my god, Travis. Seed them across every airport in this great

766
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:49,120
country of ours. Every time I fly to a new airport, the Atlanta airport, I have the Nashville

767
00:36:49,120 --> 00:36:54,000
airport with its long layovers. I have never been in the Nashville airport and not wanted

768
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:54,320
new underwear.

769
00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:59,440
Okay, let's walk through it. Hi, excuse me. Yes, my name is Travis McElroy. This is my

770
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:06,160
license. I'm looking for a discreet location in the airport where I can duct tape a mysterious

771
00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:06,720
package to.

772
00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:11,840
It's easier to ask for forgiveness than permission on this specific one. They don't gotta know.

773
00:37:11,840 --> 00:37:16,480
Listen, the level of discretion, Justin, yes, there's a challenge there. I'm gonna have

774
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:20,400
to. But, I think it's possible. Let me suggest this.

775
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:25,040
You can't just skip out halfway out of a sentence when you do not have an ending to

776
00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:30,000
the sentence. You can't get around to talking about circumventing airport security measures.

777
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:33,680
I know that there are places where you can, like, there are places in airports where you

778
00:37:33,680 --> 00:37:38,320
can, like, rent. Basically, it's like a tiny hotel room for, like, an hour to nap in.

779
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:40,080
What are you talking about?

780
00:37:40,080 --> 00:37:41,920
This is the thing. This is not in every airport.

781
00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:45,680
Yeah, it's a thing. Yeah. Yeah, little micro hotels in the airport.

782
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:50,240
I think maybe there's, like, a locker in there. If that exists, I could do that.

783
00:37:50,240 --> 00:37:55,360
Is this what the American Airlines Admirals Club is? Like, if I went into the adm- if

784
00:37:55,360 --> 00:38:00,960
I ever got behind those glistening doors, would I just find dozens of duct tape underwear

785
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:02,400
to the wall for rich-

786
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:06,000
Well, the original name was the American Airlines Clean Butt Experience.

787
00:38:07,840 --> 00:38:10,560
Why don't you go to Shoe Shine? Go to Shoe Shine, slip them a hundo,

788
00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:13,280
just say, I need to keep something here, and then you'll be arrested.

789
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:18,080
Okay. Damn it. I think that there's something to this, though, because I think you could

790
00:38:18,080 --> 00:38:23,280
make this, like, a form of geocaching where it's, like, take some underpants, leave some underpants.

791
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:32,320
Oh, Travis. I hadn't even considered the act of, you know, take a penny, need a penny.

792
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:37,280
Right? Like, you open up an app on your phone, and it is like, do you need fresh socks? Cool.

793
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:39,440
20 feet to your right, go down that alley.

794
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:45,600
All it would take is one, and I don't want to get too blue here, but Bad Apple, who puts

795
00:38:45,600 --> 00:38:51,520
some maybe less than clean stuff in there, and then it's the- it spoils the bunch.

796
00:38:51,520 --> 00:38:53,360
One Bad Apple, if you will.

797
00:38:53,360 --> 00:38:57,360
I mean, you put literally a bad rotten apple in the bag of dead drop underwear,

798
00:38:57,360 --> 00:38:59,040
and it's- none of it's going to be wearable.

799
00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:02,960
Well, that is the thing. Like, it's- no matter how good you are at hiding this stuff,

800
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:05,760
it's always going to be a risk if you start counting on it.

801
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:06,000
Yeah.

802
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:09,040
Where it's just like, you know what? I don't even have to worry about this,

803
00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:10,320
because I know I got that underpants over there.

804
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:13,680
But if you can't count on it, there's no point in this.

805
00:39:13,680 --> 00:39:19,120
No, it's there if you need it, and it's like, oh, thank God this worked. But you can't take

806
00:39:19,120 --> 00:39:22,000
it for granted that it's going to be there. You can't be like, well, I have to pee,

807
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:25,200
but rather than find a bathroom, I'm just going to, like, burn this one.

808
00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:27,600
This is just a burner underpants.

809
00:39:27,600 --> 00:39:28,080
This is it.

810
00:39:28,080 --> 00:39:28,800
You can't do that.

811
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:33,360
Collaborate team. You have underpants, leave underpants. Maybe just start doing this.

812
00:39:33,360 --> 00:39:36,560
Next time you're at the airport, you pack too many underwear, and you're leaving.

813
00:39:36,560 --> 00:39:38,960
You're not coming back, because then all your stuff's done.

814
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:42,560
But you got a fresh pair, you don't need it, just hide it somewhere.

815
00:39:42,560 --> 00:39:45,840
And put that energy out there in the universe. It's a secret. They'll come back to you.

816
00:39:45,840 --> 00:39:47,280
You won't want them to.

817
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:52,880
Could you start, could you do this mobily? Could you have, could we have some buttons

818
00:39:52,880 --> 00:39:58,000
made up that are like, just ask me, I've got them, and then a picture of a wink,

819
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:02,000
and people see that button, and they know that you're packing undies for them.

820
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:02,800
Yeah.

821
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:05,200
Ooh, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.

822
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:07,040
That's a good conversation, too.

823
00:40:07,040 --> 00:40:09,200
You're the one with the underwear for me, right?

824
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:12,320
No. A lot of us have red carnations, so.

825
00:40:12,880 --> 00:40:15,840
So, we should have talked about it more before we started.

826
00:40:15,840 --> 00:40:19,120
Hey, let's take a break and go over to the Money Zone.

827
00:40:29,360 --> 00:40:32,080
Do you think everybody's going to think that we're messy underwear boys, though?

828
00:40:32,080 --> 00:40:34,240
Because I just worry that we talked about it for like 20 minutes,

829
00:40:34,240 --> 00:40:36,240
and people are going to think we're just sort of messy underwear boys.

830
00:40:36,240 --> 00:40:40,000
We've been doing this show like 369 times, something like that.

831
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:44,080
They, if they wanted to build a case file against our messy underwear abilities,

832
00:40:44,080 --> 00:40:47,840
they would have plenty of evidence to compile a very compelling case.

833
00:40:48,560 --> 00:40:49,920
So, tell me about Casper Trapp.

834
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:55,280
I traveled out of the last like 10 days, nine of them,

835
00:40:56,720 --> 00:41:01,600
and I missed sleeping on my Casper mattress so much.

836
00:41:01,600 --> 00:41:06,240
Not only emotionally and mentally, but physically.

837
00:41:06,240 --> 00:41:10,320
My body craved that Casper comfort.

838
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:12,480
I miss it so much.

839
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:15,360
And like, this is not a joke- As somebody who you spent three of those days with,

840
00:41:15,360 --> 00:41:16,640
thank you very much.

841
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:21,120
Listen, I love you, and I love my in-laws, and I traveled to LA,

842
00:41:21,120 --> 00:41:23,600
and I love my friends, and I love my co-workers and shit.

843
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:27,840
But not, I don't love any of you as much as I love my Casper mattress.

844
00:41:27,840 --> 00:41:28,800
I'm sorry.

845
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:31,040
My Casper mattress is my closest and dearest friend.

846
00:41:31,040 --> 00:41:34,640
He's always there for me, wrapping his loving arms around me.

847
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:37,200
I love him, and it's so comfortable.

848
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:41,200
Oh, it's the best. It's the best. I love it.

849
00:41:41,200 --> 00:41:44,640
Do you want to talk about how people can secure their own Casper-

850
00:41:44,640 --> 00:41:45,440
What are you doing?

851
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:47,520
Oh, we have an ad.

852
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:49,760
Oh, I was just talking about how much I love my Casper mattress.

853
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:53,360
Well, Casper mattresses combine multiple supportive memory foams

854
00:41:53,360 --> 00:41:57,360
for quality sleep service with the right amounts of both sink and bounce,

855
00:41:57,360 --> 00:41:58,640
and sounds and bing.

856
00:41:59,200 --> 00:42:05,200
And you can be sure of your Casper purchase with 100 nights risk-free sleep on it trial.

857
00:42:05,200 --> 00:42:07,280
So start sleeping ahead of the curve with Casper.

00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:12,480

I want to tell you about stamps.com.

862
00:42:19,120 --> 00:42:21,280
Can I tell you about stamps.com?

863
00:42:21,280 --> 00:42:23,920
Because we're a podcast and we're the only ones that are going to tell you

864
00:42:23,920 --> 00:42:25,120
the truth about stamps.com.

865
00:42:25,120 --> 00:42:26,320
And here it comes.

866
00:42:26,320 --> 00:42:29,760
It brings you all the amazing services of the US Postal Service right to your computer.

867
00:42:29,760 --> 00:42:31,440
And that's the dang truth about it.

868
00:42:31,440 --> 00:42:34,720
You can just use your computer and you can print out any official US postage

869
00:42:34,720 --> 00:42:36,720
for any letter of package, any class of mail.

870
00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:38,160
And you let the mailman pick it up.

871
00:42:38,160 --> 00:42:41,840
No leaving the office, no lugging mail to the post office, no more hassle.

872
00:42:41,840 --> 00:42:43,280
It's super convenient.

873
00:42:43,280 --> 00:42:43,760
It's great.

874
00:42:43,760 --> 00:42:47,920
Sometimes maybe you don't have time to leave the house and go, you know, run errands.

875
00:42:47,920 --> 00:42:53,840
And so with stamps.com, they bring the errands to you, which, God, I wish that literally

876
00:42:53,840 --> 00:42:58,080
this service was offered for, like, everything I have to do in my life.

877
00:42:58,080 --> 00:43:00,640
I can't say that, but it pretty much is.

878
00:43:00,640 --> 00:43:01,760
We're getting there.

879
00:43:01,760 --> 00:43:03,440
I was going to say, it's 2018.

880
00:43:03,440 --> 00:43:03,680
Yeah.

881
00:43:03,680 --> 00:43:08,480
Yeah, right now you too can enjoy the stamps.com service with a special offer that includes

882
00:43:08,480 --> 00:43:11,920
a four-week trial plus postage and a digital scale.

883
00:43:11,920 --> 00:43:13,760
Are you ready for a happier new year?

884
00:43:13,760 --> 00:43:14,480
Well, I hope so.

885
00:43:14,480 --> 00:43:18,080
Just go to stamps.com and click on the microphone at the top of the homepage and type in my

886
00:43:18,080 --> 00:43:18,640
brother.

887
00:43:18,640 --> 00:43:20,880
That's stamps.com, enter my brother.

888
00:43:21,440 --> 00:43:22,640
I love to mail shit.

889
00:43:23,520 --> 00:43:25,520
Yeah, cool, cool, cool.

890
00:43:25,520 --> 00:43:26,800
I'm getting pretty excited about this.

891
00:43:26,800 --> 00:43:28,240
I'm signing up right now.

892
00:43:28,240 --> 00:43:28,720
Are you?

893
00:43:28,720 --> 00:43:29,280
Are you really?

894
00:43:29,280 --> 00:43:31,280
Is that why you're not reading the Jumbotron?

895
00:43:31,280 --> 00:43:33,280
Yeah, hold on, I'll get back to it.

896
00:43:33,280 --> 00:43:34,560
Okay.

897
00:43:36,160 --> 00:43:41,680
News Goblins is a weekly podcast focused on hard news, not hard news, nerd news.

898
00:43:41,680 --> 00:43:42,400
I mean, it is hard.

899
00:43:42,400 --> 00:43:44,240
It is challenging sometimes.

900
00:43:44,240 --> 00:43:45,600
Challenging nerds.

901
00:43:45,600 --> 00:43:52,400
Hard nerds get swole with these hard nerds, nerd news, nerd culture, nerd relationships,

902
00:43:52,400 --> 00:43:53,920
and maybe goblins.

903
00:43:53,920 --> 00:43:59,520
News Goblins is hosted by Jared and Leslie Anderson, real, live, married weirdos with

904
00:43:59,520 --> 00:44:04,320
graduate degrees in writing and publishing credits in places like Asimov's, Drabblecast,

905
00:44:04,320 --> 00:44:05,440
and Escape Pod.

906
00:44:05,440 --> 00:44:10,480
Jared and Leslie are curious, silly, creative professionals who love to discuss serious

907
00:44:10,480 --> 00:44:14,480
and not-so-serious topics with a mix of humor and insight.

908
00:44:14,480 --> 00:44:18,320
You can find out more at newsgoblins.com.

909
00:44:18,320 --> 00:44:19,600
Or on iTunes.

910
00:44:19,600 --> 00:44:21,600
Just search iTunes for News Goblins.

911
00:44:21,600 --> 00:44:30,320
Yeah, I got another message here from Clayton, and it's for Yoshi, Eli, and Ruggles.

912
00:44:30,320 --> 00:44:30,880
Hell yeah.

913
00:44:30,880 --> 00:44:32,720
Those are some choice names all around.

914
00:44:33,680 --> 00:44:34,720
Told you I'd get one.

915
00:44:36,720 --> 00:44:39,040
Got a little hard there.

916
00:44:39,840 --> 00:44:44,080
Anyway, congrats on being the coolest group of people ever and inspiring me to create

917
00:44:44,080 --> 00:44:44,960
every single day.

918
00:44:44,960 --> 00:44:46,000
Collaborate team.

919
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:47,200
Collaborate team, there it is.

920
00:44:47,200 --> 00:44:53,200
Here's to another year of talking to bears, gambling with goblins, and going to Bangor

921
00:44:53,200 --> 00:44:54,560
for chicken wings.

922
00:44:54,560 --> 00:45:01,360
I love you, time traveler boy, stab child, and Yoshi, but spelled with a B emoji.

923
00:45:01,360 --> 00:45:03,200
And as always, Rudy dies.

924
00:45:03,200 --> 00:45:07,200
I'm pretty sure it's Bangor, Maine.

925
00:45:07,200 --> 00:45:11,440
Bangor just does not trip off the tongue in the same way.

926
00:45:11,440 --> 00:45:15,840
I bet they have a lot of fun with that turn of phrase up there though, like it's a

927
00:45:15,840 --> 00:45:17,760
Bangor, get it, it's our town kind of.

928
00:45:19,520 --> 00:45:21,040
Boy, I'd love to go eat some chicken wings.

929
00:45:21,040 --> 00:45:22,800
That's my main takeaway from this sweet message.

930
00:45:23,520 --> 00:45:24,480
We have one more message.

931
00:45:24,480 --> 00:45:26,880
This is for Claire, and it's from Ivy.

932
00:45:26,880 --> 00:45:29,600
It says, Claire, I need to tell you something.

933
00:45:29,600 --> 00:45:30,160
I'm gay.

934
00:45:30,720 --> 00:45:32,800
I know this is sudden.

935
00:45:32,800 --> 00:45:35,280
I'm not sure if you suspected when you proposed to me.

936
00:45:35,840 --> 00:45:40,960
I look forward to building a forge in our backyard where we'll create powerful silverware

937
00:45:40,960 --> 00:45:44,080
and other sacred artifacts to pass down to our children.

938
00:45:44,080 --> 00:45:45,440
I love you.

939
00:45:45,440 --> 00:45:47,280
This is the fucking best.

940
00:45:47,280 --> 00:45:55,040
There is very little punctuation in this message, which makes it reads like a very energetic.

941
00:45:55,840 --> 00:46:00,800
It's a lot of sort of thoughts and ideas crammed into this message, and I adore it.

942
00:46:00,800 --> 00:46:05,600
Knowing the speed at which people had to operate to get a Jumbotron in 2018, I think we're

943
00:46:05,600 --> 00:46:09,680
going to see a lot of fucking radical stream of consciousness Jumbotrons this year.

944
00:46:09,680 --> 00:46:14,160
Becomings like slam poetry.

945
00:46:14,160 --> 00:46:18,880
SF Sketch Fest is just around the corner, January 11th to 28th, and there will be plenty

How about a Yahoo?

Yep.

958
00:46:55,760 --> 00:46:58,880
Okay, again, it's fucked up really bad.

959
00:46:58,880 --> 00:47:01,600
It was sent in by Level 9000 Yajuru Drew Davenport.

960
00:47:01,600 --> 00:47:07,040
Thank you, Drew, and it's from, I don't know, but I'm going to call this one.

961
00:47:07,040 --> 00:47:13,840
Esther asks, who do you think will win in a fight, your mailman or your garbage man?

962
00:47:14,560 --> 00:47:21,600
Let's just gender neutralize this and mail carrier or sanitation worker, I guess.

963
00:47:21,600 --> 00:47:22,100
Yes.

964
00:47:23,680 --> 00:47:28,240
These two have been obviously beefing for a long, long time, and it's a secret war,

965
00:47:28,240 --> 00:47:35,680
kind of like the underworld movies or the Twilight movies where the vampires and lycanthropes

966
00:47:35,680 --> 00:47:37,440
are sort of at each other's throats.

967
00:47:37,440 --> 00:47:43,360
There is a secret war constantly going on, and read literally any book or Google it or

968
00:47:43,360 --> 00:47:47,360
whatever, but the mail carriers of our country and the sanitation workers of our country.

969
00:47:48,320 --> 00:47:52,240
Secret underground war fought at night, and nobody sees it.

970
00:47:52,240 --> 00:47:53,680
Nobody knows about it except for us now.

971
00:47:53,680 --> 00:47:56,560
Also, just real quick, it's 420 right now, so we're recording.

972
00:47:56,560 --> 00:47:58,640
I'm just trying to observe it.

973
00:47:58,640 --> 00:47:59,680
Okay, can you hear us?

974
00:47:59,680 --> 00:48:00,320
Blaze one out.

975
00:48:02,640 --> 00:48:09,920
The secret war between mail, and I have a really hard time putting my finger on what

976
00:48:09,920 --> 00:48:13,040
the solution, because I think there's more mail carriers, right?

977
00:48:13,040 --> 00:48:20,240
So they have the personnel advantage here, but we cannot discount the sanitation workers,

978
00:48:20,240 --> 00:48:23,600
big, powerful, and sometimes automated trucks.

979
00:48:23,600 --> 00:48:25,200
Yes, that's exactly what I was going to say.

980
00:48:25,200 --> 00:48:26,960
They are literally driving like tanks.

981
00:48:28,240 --> 00:48:32,720
Yeah, they got tanks, and the mail carriers, though, they do have everything that's ever

982
00:48:32,720 --> 00:48:39,680
been mailed to use as weaponry in their proud fight, and God knows that I've bought a bunch

983
00:48:39,680 --> 00:48:48,560
of swords on Amazon.com, and so they've got those working for them, but the trash ones

984
00:48:48,560 --> 00:48:52,320
have all the swords I've thrown away, which is a considerable amount, because I can't

985
00:48:52,320 --> 00:48:55,360
have 200 freaking swords in my house.

986
00:48:55,360 --> 00:48:55,920
That's true.

987
00:48:55,920 --> 00:49:02,960
Garbage carriers will have accessible swords, because they'll know they've been cataloging

988
00:49:02,960 --> 00:49:07,440
sort of where the swords are, but every sword that they have access to has been discarded

989
00:49:07,440 --> 00:49:11,200
for unneeded swords.

990
00:49:11,200 --> 00:49:17,600
The mail carriers are going to have to guess at which boxes hold new swords, so a lot of

991
00:49:17,600 --> 00:49:22,400
times they're going to get a baguette or something that someone has mailed in a sword

992
00:49:22,400 --> 00:49:23,360
box as a joke.

993
00:49:24,720 --> 00:49:29,120
Well, and not only that, but your mail carrier is going to have access to everything that's

994
00:49:29,120 --> 00:49:34,080
been sent to you, but your garbage carrier or garbage sanitation worker is going to have

995
00:49:34,080 --> 00:49:37,360
access to everything you're ashamed of and are trying to get rid of.

996
00:49:38,480 --> 00:49:41,600
You're suggesting that they could blackmail you somehow.

997
00:49:41,600 --> 00:49:46,960
Well, if we're looking at this not as like a one-v-one war, but rather more like when

998
00:49:46,960 --> 00:49:50,720
the sun and the wind tried to figure out who's more powerful to see if they could get the

999
00:49:50,720 --> 00:49:52,080
human to take their jacket off.

1000
00:49:52,080 --> 00:49:52,800
That's not what this is.

1001
00:49:52,800 --> 00:49:54,800
That's not what this is, and that makes me uncomfortable.

1002
00:49:54,800 --> 00:49:55,840
They're not fighting for us.

1003
00:49:57,680 --> 00:49:58,400
Whichever side wins, we lose.

1004
00:49:58,400 --> 00:50:06,160
That is a weird sort of like neoconservative fantasy, but that I do not espouse.

1005
00:50:06,160 --> 00:50:10,240
This is, and they've got their reasons, and it has nothing to do with us.

1006
00:50:10,240 --> 00:50:15,680
They got their own reasons, they got their own inspirations for this battle, and it's

1007
00:50:15,680 --> 00:50:19,040
just a big, big street fight, and they're doing it at night, in the dark hour, when

1008
00:50:19,040 --> 00:50:25,840
none of us can see it, or underground, and that's all there is to it, and I just, I'm

1009
00:50:25,840 --> 00:50:31,920
so torn, and I'm so sad that Yahoo is so deeply fucked up, because I see little teases

1010
00:50:31,920 --> 00:50:36,880
and hints at the great comments in here that I can't read all of, but here's a fragment.

1011
00:50:37,680 --> 00:50:40,720
AIDS and diesel fumes all day and never gets out of his truck.

1012
00:50:40,720 --> 00:50:42,400
The vehicle does the actual work.

1013
00:50:42,400 --> 00:50:46,560
I don't know which one that's talking about, because both have trucks that they

1014
00:50:46,560 --> 00:50:47,520
ride around in a lot.

1015
00:50:48,080 --> 00:50:51,120
Somebody says, a switchblade or a butterfly.

1016
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:53,760
What could that possibly mean?

1017
00:50:54,960 --> 00:50:57,520
But we'll never know, because Yahoo's all garbled.

1018
00:50:57,520 --> 00:51:04,960
Do you know that both garbage trucks and mail trucks both dispatch from the exact same place?

1019
00:51:04,960 --> 00:51:06,000
Is that true?

1020
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:10,240
They return to the same place, and there's a lot of tension in the air as they all clock.

1021
00:51:10,240 --> 00:51:14,800
It's like that scene where the wolf and the sheepdog are both clocking in, and they're

1022
00:51:14,800 --> 00:51:16,560
like, another day at the office, right?

1023
00:51:16,560 --> 00:51:19,840
But then, out there on the streets, it's war.

1024
00:51:19,840 --> 00:51:23,120
That makes a lot of sense, because there was one time I opened up my mailbox, and there

1025
00:51:23,120 --> 00:51:29,440
was a stinky banana peel and two old bottles in there, and I looked, and my mail was in

1026
00:51:29,440 --> 00:51:30,320
the garbage can.

1027
00:51:30,320 --> 00:51:37,040
The garbage, the sanitation workers can take the mail away from the mail carriers and throw

1028
00:51:37,040 --> 00:51:39,360
it in their trucks, and then it's trash.

1029
00:51:39,360 --> 00:51:41,280
And I think that's a huge power play.

1030
00:51:41,280 --> 00:51:42,720
It's a huge advantage.

1031
00:51:42,720 --> 00:51:47,040
It's a huge power play, because you can't, the mail carrier can't take the trash away

1032
00:51:47,040 --> 00:51:48,880
and put it in a box and put a stamp on it.

1033
00:51:48,880 --> 00:51:51,760
I mean, they can, but at great personal expense.

1034
00:51:53,280 --> 00:51:56,000
But it's nothing like the power play of like, oh, you just delivered those.

1035
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:56,720
Cool, cool, cool.

1036
00:51:56,720 --> 00:51:58,720
Let me just, and then swipe them.

1037
00:51:58,720 --> 00:52:02,640
It's a federal crime, but like, are you going to get in the truck to find them?

1038
00:52:02,640 --> 00:52:03,440
Find the evidence?

1039
00:52:03,440 --> 00:52:04,160
I don't think so.

1040
00:52:04,160 --> 00:52:11,120
Gosh, we can't, we cannot discount the garbage truck's huge automated crushing arms.

1041
00:52:11,120 --> 00:52:13,840
It's huge, you can't get rid of a body, get rid of whatever.

1042
00:52:13,840 --> 00:52:17,920
Well, or get rid of a living person, because that arm grabs you.

1043
00:52:17,920 --> 00:52:21,680
If it gets its hand on a person, I think you're already dead.

1044
00:52:21,680 --> 00:52:22,560
Like, do you know what I mean?

1045
00:52:22,560 --> 00:52:27,840
Like, once the grabbing process of that huge trash arm has got you, you're pretty much

1046
00:52:27,840 --> 00:52:28,800
done already.

1047
00:52:28,800 --> 00:52:32,400
There is no exit, because it basically lowers you into the big trash mouth.

1048
00:52:32,400 --> 00:52:36,960
It's like the people who say like, when you fall off a mountain or something, you die

1049
00:52:36,960 --> 00:52:38,320
before you hit the ground, you have like a heart attack.

1050
00:52:38,320 --> 00:52:40,560
Yeah, yeah, you're dead as soon as that arm gets its hand on you, because it will not.

1051
00:52:40,560 --> 00:52:45,040
There is no forgiveness, there is no escape, you know, emergency eject button, probably.

1052
00:52:45,040 --> 00:52:50,960
Yeah, my mail carrier, I saw him with a big sack of packages, carrying it up to my porch.

1053
00:52:50,960 --> 00:52:54,880
I'm like, I think it was probably about five days before Christmas.

1054
00:52:54,880 --> 00:52:58,800
I was like, hey, hanging in there, and he said, I'm just living for the 26th.

1055
00:52:58,800 --> 00:53:04,240
It's like, man, cool, happy holidays to you too, my friend.

1056
00:53:04,240 --> 00:53:05,360
Well, damn, I didn't even think about that.

1057
00:53:05,360 --> 00:53:12,000
There's a week here or so where the mail carrier is gonna have their hands full, and by which

1058
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:19,920
I mean literally full of holiday deliverables, and not necessarily a Glaive or a Halberd.

1059
00:53:20,800 --> 00:53:26,000
And I feel like the sanitation worker doesn't necessarily have that same, yes, obviously

1060
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:31,040
they're dealing with maybe more boxes or whatever, but I don't think they're gonna be at as much

1061
00:53:31,040 --> 00:53:32,240
of a disadvantage.

1062
00:53:32,240 --> 00:53:43,680
The first trash day after Christmas, I ruined my sanitation workers with just a number of

1063
00:53:43,680 --> 00:53:48,640
pink boxes that are just unfathomable to me.

1064
00:53:48,640 --> 00:53:52,560
I wish I could have looked at my trash like eight years ago and just be like, no, no,

1065
00:53:52,560 --> 00:53:54,560
no, really, I promise.

1066
00:53:54,560 --> 00:53:58,000
You're gonna carry all of this out, I swear to you, seriously.

1067
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:00,400
Oh, shit, okay.

1068
00:54:00,400 --> 00:54:04,320
I've always wondered about it, because sometimes when you order something from Amazon, the

1069
00:54:04,320 --> 00:54:09,520
item is in a box already, but then Amazon puts it in another box.

1070
00:54:09,520 --> 00:54:10,160
I hate that.

1071
00:54:10,160 --> 00:54:15,200
But what if that's just the mail carriers fucking with the sanitation workers?

1072
00:54:16,480 --> 00:54:19,760
Like, guys, I put it in another box.

1073
00:54:19,760 --> 00:54:22,080
That would have been two boxes.

1074
00:54:22,080 --> 00:54:24,400
It's probably where this beef got started.

1075
00:54:24,400 --> 00:54:26,080
Yeah, absolutely.

1076
00:54:26,080 --> 00:54:27,520
Stop with all the boxes.

1077
00:54:27,520 --> 00:54:30,000
Just put a stamp on this vacuum cleaner.

1078
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:31,280
Don't even put it in a box.

1079
00:54:31,280 --> 00:54:33,040
Just put a stamp on it, mail it, it's fine.

1080
00:54:33,040 --> 00:54:34,720
They're gonna take it out of the box anyway.

1081
00:54:34,720 --> 00:54:41,040
This is probably one of the main causes, and also the assassination of the Duke of Trash.

1082
00:54:41,040 --> 00:54:43,200
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1083
00:54:43,200 --> 00:54:44,640
Nobody wants to talk about it.

1084
00:54:44,640 --> 00:54:51,440
Nobody even talks about it, but it sent ripples and really caused this huge scuffle.

1085
00:54:51,440 --> 00:54:52,480
How about another question?

1086
00:54:52,480 --> 00:54:56,560
Yeah, I'm spending some of my holiday at my grandparents' house, and I'm pretty drunk.

1087
00:54:57,600 --> 00:54:58,560
Cool, thank you.

1088
00:54:58,560 --> 00:54:59,840
I went into the cold room.

1089
00:55:00,480 --> 00:55:00,980
What?

1090
00:55:02,240 --> 00:55:04,320
I went into the cold room to refill my drink.

1091
00:55:04,320 --> 00:55:05,280
What's a cold room?

1092
00:55:06,160 --> 00:55:07,520
The cellar?

1093
00:55:08,320 --> 00:55:09,680
What is a cold room?

1094
00:55:09,680 --> 00:55:12,720
Sorry, we can't continue the question right now.

1095
00:55:12,720 --> 00:55:13,920
What is a cold room?

1096
00:55:14,640 --> 00:55:16,080
What is a cold room?

1097
00:55:16,080 --> 00:55:18,320
It's a cold, it is just a cold room.

1098
00:55:18,320 --> 00:55:22,960
It's like a cold room in the basement.

1099
00:55:22,960 --> 00:55:24,720
Okay, this is like a Northerner thing.

1100
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:27,120
It's like a root cellar.

1101
00:55:28,320 --> 00:55:30,480
A room in the back of the basement that was naturally chilly.

1102
00:55:31,280 --> 00:55:34,320
We put bins of potatoes from the garden in there, and they kept all winter.

1103
00:55:34,320 --> 00:55:35,520
It's like a big fridge.

1104
00:55:35,520 --> 00:55:40,000
It's like the, you know, the refreshment zone at a gas station.

1105
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:44,480
It's like a big fridge that sometimes ruins everything you put in there.

1106
00:55:44,480 --> 00:55:45,360
Okay, fine.

1107
00:55:45,360 --> 00:55:50,080
Okay, so I went into the cold room to refill my drink, and I saw a gun.

1108
00:55:50,720 --> 00:55:54,640
It's my granddad's old air rifle, and while it looks like it hasn't been used for ages,

1109
00:55:54,640 --> 00:55:57,440
it seems in good repair, and also it looks really cool.

1110
00:55:57,440 --> 00:56:01,360
So I check it out, figure out how to load it and cock it, but not how to uncock it.

1111
00:56:01,360 --> 00:56:03,600
So I ended up pulling the trigger just to uncock it.

1112
00:56:03,600 --> 00:56:06,160
After all, it had spider webs all over it.

1113
00:56:06,160 --> 00:56:07,200
It won't be loaded.

1114
00:56:07,200 --> 00:56:07,920
Bad logic there.

1115
00:56:07,920 --> 00:56:11,040
You have made so many issues already.

1116
00:56:11,040 --> 00:56:13,600
Crack, and there's a hole in my granny's wall.

1117
00:56:13,600 --> 00:56:17,680
I put the gun back, take my drink, and now I'm sat in the living room with my mom, dad,

1118
00:56:17,680 --> 00:56:20,080
sister, and granny watching the end of Skyfall.

1119
00:56:22,480 --> 00:56:26,960
It's been 20 minutes since I've punched a hole straight through the cold room.

1120
00:56:26,960 --> 00:56:28,240
How do I break the news?

1121
00:56:28,240 --> 00:56:30,560
And that's from Naughty Not Nice in Newcastle.

1122
00:56:30,560 --> 00:56:31,760
I mean, I'll say.

1123
00:56:31,760 --> 00:56:33,520
That's pretty naughty, bud.

1124
00:56:33,520 --> 00:56:39,040
Let's just go ahead and preface this by saying, just preface whatever we're about to say.

1125
00:56:39,040 --> 00:56:40,720
Don't play with guns.

1126
00:56:40,720 --> 00:56:44,000
Don't play with guns drunk in a house that's not-

1127
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:45,920
No story has ever begun.

1128
00:56:45,920 --> 00:56:51,920
So I was playing with this gun and aided with, and nothing happened and everything was fine.

1129
00:56:51,920 --> 00:56:52,400
Don't play with guns.

1130
00:56:52,400 --> 00:56:55,680
Even if it's an air rifle, it's still a bad time for you.

1131
00:56:55,680 --> 00:56:57,760
Clearly, you punched a hole in the cold room.

1132
00:56:57,760 --> 00:57:00,000
Yeah, ain't gonna stay cold for long.

1133
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:01,600
It's a lot of bad potatoes.

1134
00:57:01,600 --> 00:57:06,960
Or you have just made the cold room larger by sharing the cold with whatever bigger room

1135
00:57:06,960 --> 00:57:08,960
is containing the smaller cold room.

1136
00:57:08,960 --> 00:57:12,000
Possibly.

1137
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:14,800
Yeah, I guess maybe it is a, yeah, I guess it's a-

1138
00:57:14,800 --> 00:57:15,600
Northern UK maybe?

1139
00:57:15,600 --> 00:57:19,760
Okay, the thing where I found it being a northern thing is on a website, the subtitle for which

1140
00:57:19,760 --> 00:57:22,480
is Everything About Old English Sheep Dogs.

1141
00:57:22,480 --> 00:57:25,440
So who's to say the veracity?

1142
00:57:25,440 --> 00:57:30,640
You have broken every rule of gun usage.

1143
00:57:30,640 --> 00:57:33,040
Number one is, of course, don't.

1144
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:37,760
But number two, right after that is like, it's always loaded.

1145
00:57:37,760 --> 00:57:39,440
You treat it like it's always loaded.

1146
00:57:39,440 --> 00:57:40,560
It's a dangerous thing.

1147
00:57:40,560 --> 00:57:41,440
What's wrong with you?

1148
00:57:41,440 --> 00:57:42,960
Especially when you are.

1149
00:57:42,960 --> 00:57:44,720
Treat it like it's loaded when you are.

1150
00:57:46,240 --> 00:57:46,960
Jesus.

1151
00:57:46,960 --> 00:57:50,000
Yeah, we're having a lot of fun here, but there's also a part of this question that

1152
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:51,600
scares the living shit out of me.

1153
00:57:52,400 --> 00:57:52,640
Yeah.

1154
00:57:53,680 --> 00:57:58,800
So let's, I don't know how to get past that and get into the fun zone, necessarily.

1155
00:57:58,800 --> 00:58:00,560
He did say air rifle, right?

1156
00:58:00,560 --> 00:58:01,520
I don't understand.

1157
00:58:01,520 --> 00:58:06,080
Should that be able to put a whole, I guess it would, huh?

1158
00:58:06,080 --> 00:58:07,280
It obviously has.

1159
00:58:07,280 --> 00:58:07,680
It did.

1160
00:58:07,680 --> 00:58:09,360
It did, huh?

1161
00:58:09,360 --> 00:58:12,640
Let's not pretend like we have any idea what a cold dream is made out of.

1162
00:58:12,640 --> 00:58:14,160
It might be rice paper.

1163
00:58:14,160 --> 00:58:14,800
I don't know.

1164
00:58:15,760 --> 00:58:17,520
You seem efficient, but you're right.

1165
00:58:17,520 --> 00:58:20,080
You have to say, I mean, you've got to say something.

1166
00:58:20,720 --> 00:58:22,160
James Bond did it.

1167
00:58:22,160 --> 00:58:23,760
James, you blame it on James Bond.

1168
00:58:23,760 --> 00:58:26,320
I mean, you blame it on whoever you want to blame it on.

1169
00:58:26,320 --> 00:58:31,040
We're talking about a lot of spoiled potatoes if I'm going off of this Old English Sheep

1170
00:58:31,040 --> 00:58:31,760
Dog website.

1171
00:58:33,840 --> 00:58:34,640
You're talking about a lot of-

1172
00:58:34,640 --> 00:58:36,160
Which is the new Yahoo.

1173
00:58:36,160 --> 00:58:43,600
Yeah, I'll get off Yahoo and go to oes.org, the Old English Sheep Dog information hub.

1174
00:58:45,200 --> 00:58:48,400
It's a lot of bad potatoes, and you can't do that to your grams.

1175
00:58:48,400 --> 00:58:51,280
So you've got to speak up.

1176
00:58:51,280 --> 00:58:52,560
Now, who do you blame it on?

1177
00:58:52,560 --> 00:58:53,920
Travis suggests James Bond.

1178
00:58:53,920 --> 00:58:55,840
I do not dislike this.

1179
00:58:55,840 --> 00:58:57,760
You could say it's a new TV technology.

1180
00:58:58,320 --> 00:59:02,960
It's the 4D like Captain EO, but instead of spraying water in your face, when James Bond

1181
00:59:02,960 --> 00:59:05,280
shoots a gun, bullets do come out of the TV.

1182
00:59:05,280 --> 00:59:09,440
And one, thankfully, you should be fortunate it only destroyed your cold room.

1183
00:59:09,440 --> 00:59:10,880
You could blame it on your granddad.

1184
00:59:11,600 --> 00:59:12,720
Blame it on your granddad.

1185
00:59:13,840 --> 00:59:15,600
Blame it on an Old English Sheep Dog.

1186
00:59:15,600 --> 00:59:17,200
Wait, is granddad still in the picture?

1187
00:59:17,200 --> 00:59:19,360
Granddad is not in the room watching Skyfall.

1188
00:59:19,360 --> 00:59:21,760
Maybe he's upstairs doing something else.

1189
00:59:23,280 --> 00:59:27,280
In another area of the cold room, just wait.

1190
00:59:27,280 --> 00:59:29,600
We also don't know how big the cold room is.

1191
00:59:29,600 --> 00:59:30,880
One of those Christmas carols.

1192
00:59:30,880 --> 00:59:33,360
Are there any of the Christmas carol ghosts that would have done this?

1193
00:59:33,360 --> 00:59:34,800
Because I know that they're in the UK.

1194
00:59:34,800 --> 00:59:35,760
You know Present.

1195
00:59:35,760 --> 00:59:38,000
You know Present would fuck around with an air rifle like,

1196
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:40,640
Oh ho ho, I'm fucked up.

1197
00:59:40,640 --> 00:59:42,720
Look at the stunts I can do with this gun.

1198
00:59:45,600 --> 00:59:48,240
I feel so good because I'm holding a gun.

1199
00:59:48,240 --> 00:59:50,640
Like, yo dude, you need to calm down a little bit.

1200
00:59:52,080 --> 00:59:53,920
Don't tell me what to do.

1201
00:59:53,920 --> 00:59:55,680
I'm in charge now.

1202
00:59:55,680 --> 00:59:56,400
Oh god.

1203
00:59:56,400 --> 01:00:01,120
My brothers and sisters have no scoped here for ages and now I am here to play with-

1204
01:00:01,120 --> 01:00:04,000
Everyone has told me how great it is to play with guns.

1205
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:09,520
This is ignorance and this is want and their KD ratio is a joke.

1206
01:00:10,240 --> 01:00:12,080
Now I have an air rifle.

1207
01:00:12,080 --> 01:00:13,680
Ho ho ho.

1208
01:00:13,680 --> 01:00:15,120
Now which movie are we doing now?

1209
01:00:15,120 --> 01:00:16,240
That was Die Hard.

1210
01:00:16,240 --> 01:00:18,880
That one was Die Hard and it was a little on the nose.

1211
01:00:18,880 --> 01:00:23,520
Can you find some way to create a locked room mystery?

1212
01:00:23,520 --> 01:00:28,720
Because if you can't blame it on somebody, blame it on the unsolvable mystery.

1213
01:00:28,720 --> 01:00:31,360
Although you gotta be careful because Sherlock will roll up.

1214
01:00:31,360 --> 01:00:33,760
Sherlock will roll up in this one.

1215
01:00:33,760 --> 01:00:36,080
You got Sherlock and Poirot up in your neck of the woods.

1216
01:00:36,080 --> 01:00:37,120
You gotta be careful.

1217
01:00:37,120 --> 01:00:39,600
Then you gotta pit them against each other and that's the only way you win.

1218
01:00:40,160 --> 01:00:41,680
Locked room mystery is gonna be tricky though.

1219
01:00:41,680 --> 01:00:44,720
You're gonna have to get a wire in through the small hole you've created in the wall

1220
01:00:45,280 --> 01:00:46,640
and use it to lock the door.

1221
01:00:47,280 --> 01:00:48,480
That's a pretty easy locked room mystery.

1222
01:00:48,480 --> 01:00:51,920
You're gonna need a block of ice to melt but that's gonna be hard to do in the cold room.

1223
01:00:51,920 --> 01:00:52,480
Yeah, it's true.

1224
01:00:52,480 --> 01:00:53,280
It's gonna take a while.

1225
01:00:54,400 --> 01:00:55,840
Can you stick a bit of gum in there?

1226
01:00:56,800 --> 01:00:57,840
Stick a bit of chewy.

1227
01:00:58,400 --> 01:00:59,680
Little ducky tape?

1228
01:00:59,680 --> 01:01:02,560
Little ducky tape or a little bit of chewy and you're fine.

1229
01:01:02,560 --> 01:01:03,840
You're probably not fine.

1230
01:01:03,840 --> 01:01:04,160
Listen.

1231
01:01:04,160 --> 01:01:04,960
Don't play with guns.

1232
01:01:04,960 --> 01:01:06,400
We've had a lot of fun here.

1233
01:01:06,400 --> 01:01:09,200
I think this is actually a very important thing for the three of us to do.

1234
01:01:09,200 --> 01:01:11,280
Question asker, naughty not nice in Newcastle.

1235
01:01:11,280 --> 01:01:12,720
We had a lot of fun with your question.

1236
01:01:12,720 --> 01:01:14,000
I need you to go get a chair.

1237
01:01:14,800 --> 01:01:16,480
Go ahead and put it in the corner, facing the corner.

1238
01:01:16,480 --> 01:01:18,480
I need you to sit right there in the chair for 15 minutes.

1239
01:01:18,480 --> 01:01:19,680
Pause the podcast.

1240
01:01:19,680 --> 01:01:20,560
You're in timeout.

1241
01:01:20,560 --> 01:01:24,400
We are literally putting you, I'm assuming an adult, right in timeout.

1242
01:01:24,400 --> 01:01:25,840
15 minutes, sit right there.

1243
01:01:25,840 --> 01:01:30,240
What you did was quite bad and we had a lot of fun with the question but we shouldn't have

1244
01:01:30,240 --> 01:01:31,920
because what you did was a bad thing.

1245
01:01:31,920 --> 01:01:32,880
Go timeout.

1246
01:01:32,880 --> 01:01:36,800
Take a picture from the corner and email it to us on the same thread so we know it's you.

1247
01:01:37,600 --> 01:01:40,320
We're going to be doing some punishments here in 2018.

1248
01:01:40,320 --> 01:01:45,440
So that's going to be one of our new things is like if you, okay, all right.

1249
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:52,160
If you write in a question to us, you need to accept that you might get a legally binding

1250
01:01:52,160 --> 01:01:57,760
punishment and we're going to be punishing some people this year for getting out of line

1251
01:01:57,760 --> 01:02:00,880
and kind of upsetting the apple cart a little bit and it sounds like you've

1252
01:02:00,880 --> 01:02:02,880
earned our first punishment of 2018.

1253
01:02:02,880 --> 01:02:04,480
Naughty, not nice in Newcastle.

1254
01:02:04,480 --> 01:02:06,800
So go to the corner and think about what you did.

1255
01:02:06,800 --> 01:02:07,840
Set a timer on your phone.

1256
01:02:09,520 --> 01:02:13,520
Oh, I swear to God, if you get on your phone and you play your flappy bird or a game or

1257
01:02:13,520 --> 01:02:14,800
you get on Twitter, no.

1258
01:02:14,800 --> 01:02:16,560
Put your phone away after you set the timer on it.

1259
01:02:16,560 --> 01:02:18,720
Set it down and you just think about it.

1260
01:02:19,680 --> 01:02:25,440
I would also say that you could, if you owned the entire thing and then fix the hole in

1261
01:02:25,440 --> 01:02:29,200
the cold room, I think that would be acceptable too.

1262
01:02:29,200 --> 01:02:34,080
Not only that, and not to glorify this at all, but that is also a good way to then actually

1263
01:02:34,080 --> 01:02:38,080
earn a few points because like not only were you honest, but you took care of the problem

1264
01:02:38,880 --> 01:02:42,960
and you fixed it and you admitted it.

1265
01:02:42,960 --> 01:02:47,920
That is a good, responsible thing to do that almost makes up for your irresponsible

1266
01:02:47,920 --> 01:02:49,440
playing with gun actions.

1267
01:02:49,440 --> 01:02:51,120
I need photo evidence of either one.

1268
01:02:51,120 --> 01:02:53,760
Whatever option you want to take, I don't really care.

1269
01:02:53,760 --> 01:02:57,760
I don't live in your grandma's cold room, so it's your call.

1270
01:02:57,760 --> 01:03:00,320
Yes, think that, you know, 2018, who knows?

1271
01:03:01,280 --> 01:03:02,240
Should we wrap up?

1272
01:03:02,240 --> 01:03:04,000
Yeah, I believe we should.

1273
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:05,520
I've had too much fun already.

1274
01:03:05,520 --> 01:03:06,640
I can't handle any more fun.

1275
01:03:08,560 --> 01:03:14,080
But people at home, if you're looking for more fun, I just guested on a couple podcasts

1276
01:03:14,080 --> 01:03:15,440
that are going to be coming out soon.

1277
01:03:17,760 --> 01:03:20,000
I'm on an upcoming episode of Can I Pet Your Dog?

1278
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:23,840
Upcoming episode where I returned for an episode of Bunker Buddies.

1279
01:03:23,840 --> 01:03:29,040
Uh, I just guested on a video that's going to be coming out on Gary Dunn's YouTube

1280
01:03:29,040 --> 01:03:32,640
channel, but I also just did an episode of Good Christian Fun, which-

1281
01:03:32,640 --> 01:03:34,560
That is such a great podcast.

1282
01:03:34,560 --> 01:03:35,040
Yes.

1283
01:03:35,040 --> 01:03:36,880
I'm very into Good Christian Fun right now.

1284
01:03:36,880 --> 01:03:38,560
I can't recommend it enough.

1285
01:03:38,560 --> 01:03:44,080
If you've ever heard Gilmore Guys, Kevin Porter from Gilmore Guys, and his friend

1286
01:03:44,080 --> 01:03:47,680
Caroline are hosting Good Christian Fun.

1287
01:03:47,680 --> 01:03:53,040
It's a review show of Christian pop culture that neither glorifies Christianity, neither

1288
01:03:53,040 --> 01:03:55,200
glorifies Christianity, nor makes fun of it.

1289
01:03:55,200 --> 01:03:59,520
It just talks about why they made the things that they made.

1290
01:03:59,520 --> 01:04:02,480
Justin, there's a Bibleman episode with your name on it, bud.

1291
01:04:02,480 --> 01:04:04,000
Ooh, nice.

1292
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:06,640
Let's see, also coming up very soon-

1293
01:04:06,640 --> 01:04:08,560
What did you do on your episode?

1294
01:04:08,560 --> 01:04:11,600
We did an episode of McGee and Me called Twister and Shout.

1295
01:04:11,600 --> 01:04:12,640
Fuck, yes.

1296
01:04:12,640 --> 01:04:19,760
Yes, it was very fun, and Griffin, I just did one episode to leave the door open for

1297
01:04:19,760 --> 01:04:22,400
you to come on and discuss other McGee and Me episodes.

1298
01:04:22,400 --> 01:04:23,920
Thank you, I appreciate that.

1299
01:04:23,920 --> 01:04:29,440
But yeah, also coming up in, well, 11 days from today, Teresa and I are going to be at

1300
01:04:29,440 --> 01:04:30,720
San Francisco Sketch Fest.

1301
01:04:31,440 --> 01:04:35,360
I'm performing in a couple shows, one Friday night, one Saturday night, but then we're

1302
01:04:35,360 --> 01:04:42,080
doing a Schmanners on Sunday the 14th in the afternoon, and you can find out all the details

1303
01:04:42,080 --> 01:04:45,520
about that at sfsketchfest.com.

1304
01:04:45,520 --> 01:04:47,040
And you got the cruise, too, right?

1305
01:04:47,040 --> 01:04:51,040
Yeah, and we're doing the JoCo cruise, which is coming up middle of February, February

1306
01:04:51,040 --> 01:04:52,560
18th through 25th.

1307
01:04:52,560 --> 01:04:56,800
We're going to be doing Schmanners there as well, just a bunch of other random things,

1308
01:04:56,800 --> 01:05:00,960
and Dad's going to be there, and yeah, it's going to be a good time if you want to come

1309
01:05:00,960 --> 01:05:01,520
check that out.

1310
01:05:01,520 --> 01:05:03,760
I think it's going to be an absolute blast.

1311
01:05:03,760 --> 01:05:07,280
Not only have I never been on JoCo cruise before, I've never been on a cruise before,

1312
01:05:07,280 --> 01:05:08,480
so I'm super excited about it.

1313
01:05:08,480 --> 01:05:09,280
Yeah, I'm going to say-

1314
01:05:09,280 --> 01:05:13,600
You can find out about that, JoCoCruise.com, J-O-C-O-Cruise.com.

1315
01:05:13,600 --> 01:05:20,240
I want to say thanks to everybody who pitched in during the holiday season for both MoBimBam

1316
01:05:20,240 --> 01:05:23,840
Angels, who just crushed the empty stockings list this year.

1317
01:05:24,640 --> 01:05:28,400
That's a thing that when I see people in Huntington, that's the thing they talk about,

1318
01:05:28,400 --> 01:05:32,960
and that is so wonderful, and I hope that you all appreciate what a change you make

1319
01:05:32,960 --> 01:05:37,120
in our lovely hometown and Justin's current place of residence, and everybody who came

1320
01:05:37,120 --> 01:05:43,600
out to the Candle Nights show, and everybody who chipped in on the Candle Nights Star project

1321
01:05:43,600 --> 01:05:49,520
that Riley spearheaded, who helped raise, I think it was like $45,000 total for Big

1322
01:05:49,520 --> 01:05:51,680
Brothers Big Sisters of South Central West Virginia.

1323
01:05:52,560 --> 01:05:59,680
They were asking for $60,000 to help open one of their closed branches up again, and

1324
01:06:00,640 --> 01:06:05,520
the fact that the listeners of this podcast almost single-handedly got there is so-

1325
01:06:05,520 --> 01:06:07,120
They weren't asking us for it.

1326
01:06:07,120 --> 01:06:07,680
No, no, no.

1327
01:06:07,680 --> 01:06:11,120
That was their big ask when they lost their funding.

1328
01:06:12,240 --> 01:06:18,640
The fact that you all came out for that to such a huge degree is so wonderful, and we

1329
01:06:18,640 --> 01:06:20,000
love you all so much for it.

1330
01:06:20,800 --> 01:06:24,000
Also, I want to say thanks to John Roderick in The Long Winters for the use of our theme

1331
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:26,320
song, It's a Departure, off the album Putting the Days to Bed.

1332
01:06:26,320 --> 01:06:29,120
It's a very good album, and thank you to Maximum Fun for having us on the network.

Collaborate, team.

1340
01:06:43,920 --> 01:06:44,640
Just think about it.

1341
01:06:44,640 --> 01:06:45,680
You don't got to act on it right now.

1342
01:06:45,680 --> 01:06:46,400
Just think about it.

1343
01:06:46,400 --> 01:06:49,280
Uh, and, uh, Griff, you got one more Yahoo for us?

1344
01:06:49,280 --> 01:06:52,320
Yeah, I have one more off this fucking blighted website.

1345
01:06:52,320 --> 01:06:54,960
Uh, it's from Andrew Gerald.

1346
01:06:54,960 --> 01:06:56,800
Thank you, Andrew, for sending this one in.

1347
01:06:56,800 --> 01:06:59,200
It's by Yahoo Answers user.

1348
01:06:59,200 --> 01:07:03,600
I can't see it because the website's all fucked up, but I'm going to say, uh, Dennis

1349
01:07:03,600 --> 01:07:11,360
asks, what if, for the last episode of Frasier, Kelsey Grammer was butt naked the whole time?

1350
01:07:11,360 --> 01:07:15,440
My name's Justin McElroy.

1351
01:07:17,120 --> 01:07:18,720
My name's Travis McElroy.

1352
01:07:18,720 --> 01:07:20,080
I'm Griffin McElroy.

1353
01:07:20,080 --> 01:07:21,200
This has been My Brother, My Brother.

1354
01:07:21,200 --> 01:07:23,760
May it kiss your dad's square on the lips.

1355
01:07:23,760 --> 01:07:47,520
Hello, Internet.

1356
01:07:47,520 --> 01:07:49,440
I'm your husband, host Travis McElroy.

1357
01:07:49,440 --> 01:07:51,680
And I'm your wife, host Teresa McElroy.

1358
01:07:51,680 --> 01:07:53,360
And together we present Schmanners.

1359
01:07:53,360 --> 01:07:54,800
It's extraordinary etiquette.

1360
01:07:54,800 --> 01:07:56,400
For ordinary occasions.

1361
01:07:56,400 --> 01:08:01,440
We explain the historical significance of everyday etiquette topics, then answer your

1362
01:08:01,440 --> 01:08:03,280
questions relating to modern life.

1363
01:08:03,280 --> 01:08:07,440

1366
01:08:11,040 --> 01:08:12,560
