1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:30,800
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:47,760
Welcome to My Brother and My Brother and Me, an advice show for the modern era.

6
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:51,680
I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy, and I was just talking with my middle brother,

7
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:55,280
Travis McElroy. You just went to Zen church, Travis, correct?

8
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:55,840
That is correct.

9
00:00:55,840 --> 00:01:01,680
And you and I have been told by you that your chakras are really right.

10
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:03,600
They are gaping open.

11
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:04,480
Oh, God.

12
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:08,800
Your chakras are so sharp that Xena could throw them.

13
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:11,520
That's right. That is correct.

14
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:17,760
Now, I did have a question about Zen church, and I think you're probably better equipped

15
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:20,160
to answer it than my youngest brother, Griffin McElroy, who's also with us.

16
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:26,400
When you go, do you have to renounce Jesus and his teachings, or how does that work?

17
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:30,960
Well, I wouldn't say renounce, but he is not allowed to come in with me.

18
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:38,160
He has to sit on the stairs outside and wait for me, like that scene in Peanuts when Snoopy

19
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:41,920
has to wait outside the library for Charlie Brown, and the music plays, and it plays,

20
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:44,320
no Jesus allowed.

21
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:44,820
Yeah.

22
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:46,180
Wow.

23
00:01:46,180 --> 00:01:48,480
Now, does he mind that? Is that hard on him?

24
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:53,920
No, I give him some money to grab an ice cream bar from the ice cream man when he passes,

25
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:55,440
so he has a pretty good time.

26
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:56,500
Okay, good.

27
00:01:56,500 --> 00:02:00,400
This podcast took a pretty sharp anti-Jesus turn pretty quickly.

28
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:02,160
Why? I'm giving him ice cream.

29
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:04,080
How is that anti-Jesus?

30
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:07,280
You know, I went to see my voodoo practitioner today, and you guys didn't see me.

31
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:08,560
You're going to talk to me about that.

32
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:14,720
You've been hugely, hugely different personality-wise since you started.

33
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:19,200
Every time I try to eat a frog, you're like, hey, what are you doing with this gizzard?

34
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:19,700
That's racist.

35
00:02:19,700 --> 00:02:21,200
Can I have his gizzard?

36
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:24,000
That thing you just said is racist.

37
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,480
Voodoo practitioners love gizzards, frog gizzards.

38
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:27,760
They use them in everything.

39
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:29,440
It's racist to Voodoos?

40
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:29,940
Is that-

41
00:02:29,940 --> 00:02:32,880
To the Voodoo people, like me.

42
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:33,380
To the Voodoo-

43
00:02:33,380 --> 00:02:34,880
The Voodees.

44
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:38,320
The Creole, ah, fuck it.

45
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:41,840
Jesus lives in my heart, and I never let him out.

46
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:42,400
He's like a prisoner.

47
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:43,600
You don't let him get ice cream?

48
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:46,080
I don't let him get out for anything.

49
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:47,760
Only the ice cream that Justin eats.

50
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:49,920
I'm afraid he'll leave.

51
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:53,120
He says he needs to get out to stretch his legs.

52
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:55,520
I say, no, you stay in there.

53
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:56,480
He's a POW.

54
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:01,040
Prisoner of worship.

55
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:02,000
Prisoner of worship.

56
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:05,200
So let's get to the end of this podcast.

57
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:14,320
I'm 22 years old, and I've never been involved in any kind of sports due to the fact that I

58
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:17,280
used to be rather overweight and hated any physical activity.

59
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,800
That never stopped Goldberg the goalie, but we'll move on.

60
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:25,760
After deciding to lose some weight, I've dropped over 80 pounds and have found myself

61
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:27,600
in an awkward situation.

62
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:31,040
I want to get involved in team sports, but due to my lack of effort growing up,

63
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:34,000
I feel inept in any physical activities I was running on my own.

64
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,120
Not really a team sport.

65
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:40,080
Do you have any suggestions on sports I could easily pick up or ways to join a sports team

66
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:41,600
and pretend that I'm good?

67
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:43,760
That's from Inept in England.

68
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:45,360
And boy, have you come to the right place.

69
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:48,000
Well, first, congrats on dropping 80 pounds.

70
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,520
Jesus Christ, dude.

71
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:50,560
Is it that easy?

72
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:51,200
Can I do that?

73
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:54,160
Can I just be like, I decided to weigh 80 less pounds.

74
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:57,520
Yeah, I was going to say, I feel like there's a couple steps in the middle there.

75
00:03:57,520 --> 00:03:59,840
I decided to lose some weight, so I dropped 80 pounds.

76
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:00,880
Welded off.

77
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:01,360
Yeah, right.

78
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:04,080
All right, I don't know.

79
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:08,000
First off, sports in England, I don't know what you guys are doing over there.

80
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,440
So you're going to have to take our American advice.

81
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:15,440
And maybe there's probably a parallel sport for every sport that we recommend.

82
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:18,240
Run it through Google Translator or something.

83
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:23,920
You got cricket, you got crocket, you got darts, you got lawn darts.

84
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:24,480
Rugby?

85
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:25,520
That's huge over there.

86
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:26,000
Rugby.

87
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:27,200
Darts.

88
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:28,800
Extreme rugby.

89
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:30,400
Double extreme rugby.

90
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:31,520
And boring rugby.

91
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:32,400
Boring rugby.

92
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:34,640
No hands, anybody.

93
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:37,120
This is no hands rugby.

94
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:39,360
No hands, no feet rugby.

95
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:48,080
The thing is, there are sports you could play if you're just a big fat guy without athletic talent.

96
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:55,120
I know when I was playing midget league football, I was the center, which meant that I stood there.

97
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:58,640
I was not aware of the rules of football.

98
00:04:58,640 --> 00:05:00,320
And people just kept running into you.

99
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:02,080
They kept running into me and it would hurt.

100
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:04,000
Hey, excuse me, bro.

101
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:04,800
I was standing there.

102
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:06,000
You got me again.

103
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,320
You could be, yeah, that's a great, center's a great position.

104
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:11,840
I believe that was the position filled by Fridge the Refrigerator Perry.

105
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:14,480
Yeah, but he's not big anymore.

106
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:17,520
You know, Griffin, I'm almost certain his first name is not Fridge.

107
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:21,760
He's Fridge, nicknamed the Refrigerator.

108
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:24,640
Hey, I got a great nickname for you, Fridge.

109
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:25,440
Let me guess.

110
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:26,320
I thought that-

111
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:27,440
It's Whirlpool.

112
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:30,080
It was because he was shaped like a refrigerator.

113
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:32,720
And also his first name was Fridge.

114
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:34,240
And so it was really logical.

115
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:36,320
They put two and two together.

116
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:40,160
What about Warren, Warren the Refrigerator Sap?

117
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:42,480
Former Buccaneer Slime Man.

118
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:45,600
John the Refrigerator Elway.

119
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:48,400
It's just a, it's a, it's a name that gets passed down.

120
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:51,440
Chris, Chris the Refrigerator Sabo, he needs a letter.

121
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:54,240
Sports.

122
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:58,560
Maria the Refrigerator Sharapova.

123
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:02,640
You know, as far as team sports, I know what you're saying,

124
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:06,480
because it's like a lot of people depend on you catching the baseball

125
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:08,160
and knowing where to throw the baseball.

126
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:10,800
That's why I didn't do very well.

127
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:14,480
I tried to join a softball team and I would, I would catch it.

128
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:17,200
I got good hand-eye coordination from the vidya games,

129
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:19,760
but then I would catch it, just sort of look panicked.

130
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:23,440
Yeah, and just drop it on the ground and go, I don't want it.

131
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:24,320
I don't want it.

132
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:25,040
It's too much.

133
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:25,680
Not mine.

134
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:30,000
I always, my legs lock up like one of those fucking fainting goats.

135
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,360
Whenever anyone pays any amount of attention to me,

136
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:37,680
which made, which made playing the infield and baseball really, really terrifying.

137
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:38,880
Cause like it's a shortstop.

138
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:41,360
If you catch that ball and try to run it to third,

139
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:45,120
but then your legs lock up and you fall over and you poop your pants a little bit,

140
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:47,600
they won't let you play sports anymore.

141
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:49,600
The Griffin McElroy story.

142
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:54,480
The story of Chris O'Donnell coming to a theater near you.

143
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:57,440
Do you guys have over in England, do you guys have kickball?

144
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:58,480
Do you guys do kickball?

145
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:01,040
Cause I find that that's really easy to like,

146
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:03,040
just step into a game and like call your friends.

147
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:05,680
Like, Hey, you guys want to get together a kickball game?

148
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:07,840
Like kickball is pretty good.

149
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:10,320
It's not really, I don't think it qualifies as a sport.

150
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:13,200
It's more of a game, but I think it'd be a good place to start.

151
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:16,800
But it's a good place to like start learning the basics of like team sports

152
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:19,520
and everything and kind of get out there and get active.

153
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:24,720
Here in the Americas, we have social clubs in some cities where you can come and play.

154
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:26,400
There's actually two here in Austin.

155
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:29,360
And one is for people who are actually good at sports.

156
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:30,640
And I think they have like a softball league.

157
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:33,280
And the other one is for people who just want to like drink and hang out outside

158
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:36,160
and play like kickball and the like.

159
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:40,000
And the best is when the two of them compete for the citywide trophy.

160
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,440
It just gets rambunctious.

161
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:44,400
You basically get a heavy dual scenario going on.

162
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:47,600
They have a name for people who just want to drink and play outside.

163
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:49,440
It's called all of sports ever.

164
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:56,800
The good news is I found, because I, you know, I too am not the biggest sports nut,

165
00:07:56,800 --> 00:08:01,360
but I find that you've probably got a friend that if you said to him,

166
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:03,760
you know, I'm kind of interested in sports,

167
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:08,160
he is just going to inundate you with help and facts and be like,

168
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:09,200
well, come on with me.

169
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:12,720
Let's go down and watch a cricket bout.

170
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:16,640
You know, what's funny by definition, if you about the phrase,

171
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:20,880
I'm not a sports nut, is that if you actually use the phrase sports nut,

172
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:24,320
it automatically disqualifies you from the distinction.

173
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:26,080
Unless you're Bob Uecker.

174
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:28,880
If you're Bob Uecker, he can say he's a sports nut.

175
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:29,200
Yeah.

176
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:31,360
Other than that, like you don't like sports.

177
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:35,760
You're saying something you think someone like sports says.

178
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:38,960
I'm a bit of a sports nut.

179
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:41,920
I think you could call me a sports nut.

180
00:08:41,920 --> 00:08:44,400
I spend time at the BW3s.

181
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:47,440
One could accurately classify me as a basketball man.

182
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:51,520
A soccerista.

183
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:54,400
A soccerista in your country.

184
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:57,840
Well, I don't know what they call it.

185
00:08:57,840 --> 00:08:58,560
Footballerino.

186
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:01,440
Football, footballist, I guess.

187
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:05,040
You know what's great?

188
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:06,480
Lawn games.

189
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:09,280
I don't know if you can solve your problem with lawn games,

190
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:12,400
but lawn games are like sports only.

191
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:15,440
They don't require any movement whatsoever.

192
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:17,440
And you can drink outside while you play them.

193
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:19,920
And like the more you drink, the better you get at them.

194
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:20,240
Yeah.

195
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:21,360
Can you like frisbee?

196
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:22,080
No, I mean like-

197
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:23,440
Ladder ball.

198
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:28,080
Baggos and ladder ball and washers and croquet.

199
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:30,400
Croquet is my new jam.

200
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:32,000
If you guys haven't played croquet, go to Target,

201
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,400
buy yourself a $30 croquet set, get a bunch of people together,

202
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:36,160
drink mimosas and play croquet all day.

203
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:39,040
I would love it if croquet would have a big resurgence.

204
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:42,960
I'm trying to get it started here in the ATX, but it's hard.

205
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:43,440
It's hard.

206
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:45,200
We're so separated from the rest of the country.

207
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:46,480
What about-

208
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:49,520
No, I got nothing.

209
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:53,680
I like that honesty.

210
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:55,120
Polo, that's what I was going for.

211
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:56,800
Polo, polo.

212
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:58,400
We need more horse-based sports.

213
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:02,960
We need to be more honest about the production of this show, Travis.

214
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:03,520
I like that.

215
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:07,600
So when Griffin was talking about mimosas and croquet,

216
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:11,200
I should have just said some sort of Downton Abbey reference

217
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:12,240
that I can't come up with.

218
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:12,880
Yeah.

219
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:16,800
There's something about the guy Carter.

220
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:18,320
Is that his name?

221
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:18,880
Fuck.

222
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:20,640
Mr. Bates.

223
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:21,600
Mr. Bates.

224
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:23,280
Good croquet.

225
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:24,080
God damn it.

226
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:25,280
You got me.

227
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:29,120
So maybe try fencing.

228
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:30,800
No one knows how you're really supposed to do that.

229
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:31,360
Don't do that.

230
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:32,560
Don't fucking do that.

231
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:34,400
No, don't fucking do that.

232
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:35,360
It's just sword fighting.

233
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:37,120
Trapeze artist.

234
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:37,920
Trapezing.

235
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:38,880
No one knows how to do that.

236
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:40,400
Now that you could get Jack.

237
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:43,120
What if he broke his back, put the weight right back on?

238
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:44,080
You want that heat?

239
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:46,320
Then it becomes a Lifetime movie and it's awesome.

240
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:48,800
The Griffin McElroy story.

241
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:51,840
I lost my fat, but then I broke my back and I found it again.

242
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:53,440
And then I fell down.

243
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:54,880
Then I put my pants on the infield.

244
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:57,600
A little bit while people watched me, the Griffin McElroy story.

245
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:00,480
And my fat is played by Jack Black.

246
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:03,280
It's a pretty good movie.

247
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:04,160
What's he doing?

248
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:04,960
Nothing.

249
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:06,160
Gulliver travels tubes.

250
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:07,520
Still traveling.

251
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:09,040
How about a Yahoo?

252
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:10,720
Hit me.

253
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:14,160
This one was sent in by Lisa Holifield.

254
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:14,800
Thank you, Lisa.

255
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:17,840
It's by Yahoo Answers user, the Leviathan, who asks,

256
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:20,880
how do you prepare for a staring contest?

257
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:24,880
I always get into a staring contest with my cousin when I see him.

258
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:27,520
And I want to prepare to finally beat him over the holidays.

259
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:29,440
What can I do to become a champ?

260
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:31,600
This is a good sport you get into, right?

261
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:34,560
Step one, training montage.

262
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,920
She loves her cousin, right?

263
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:39,520
I mean, by staring contest,

264
00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:42,480
she means staring at her cousin who's staring at her.

265
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:44,320
Just deep F me eyes.

266
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:48,480
Just wanting to break Colonel Law's, Travis.

267
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:49,520
What, what?

268
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:50,400
F me eyes?

269
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:51,840
F me eyes.

270
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:53,440
I censored myself.

271
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:55,120
I'm not surprised at you.

272
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:57,840
Thank you, Justin.

273
00:11:57,840 --> 00:12:00,080
Look, this is my brother and my brother in 2012.

274
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:01,200
It's about honesty.

275
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:02,800
I believe you said that.

276
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:04,400
Valentine's Day is coming up.

277
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:09,120
What can we do to make people's lovers give them F me eyes?

278
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,520
Staring contest, you're going to,

279
00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:15,440
step one, you're going to want to moisturize.

280
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:15,680
Yeah.

281
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:20,080
Is applying Visine during a staring contest legal?

282
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:20,880
Is that allowed?

283
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:23,360
As long as you don't blink, if you could do that blinkless.

284
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:25,840
Then you're a fucking robot with robot eyes.

285
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:26,160
Yeah.

286
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:27,120
Oh, robot eyes.

287
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:28,640
Steve Forbes up in this bitch.

288
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:32,480
Stab both your eyes out, put some glass in there.

289
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:36,560
You'll never, I don't think you'll have to moisten them.

290
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:38,400
Wait, do you mean just like shards of glass

291
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:39,680
or like a fake eyeball?

292
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:41,440
Glass eyeballs, not shards of glass.

293
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:44,240
Okay, shards of glass is a very intimidating technique.

294
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:44,480
Yeah.

295
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:46,640
I don't see how that helps you.

296
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:50,560
Can I get a clarification on this?

297
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:54,320
I find that I travel all around this great, great blue globe

298
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:57,040
and people have different definitions of staring contest.

299
00:12:57,040 --> 00:12:59,840
Growing up in my neck of the woods, it was if you.

300
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:00,240
Laugh.

301
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:02,000
If you blinked, you lose.

302
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,520
If you blinked, you're out.

303
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:04,800
If you blinked, you're out.

304
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:07,760
But a lot of people seem to roll with,

305
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:09,600
if you smile or laugh, you out.

306
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:10,880
It's about keeping a straight face.

307
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:13,680
No, then that could just go on forever.

308
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:16,160
See, Griffin knew what I was talking about though.

309
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:16,880
Griffin complete.

310
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:17,600
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

311
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:18,400
That's how we did it.

312
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:19,440
I've heard it.

313
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:20,160
Do you know what it was?

314
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:23,600
It was a lot of kids were doing it the original,

315
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:28,240
the original full game version of staring contest,

316
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:31,200
and they were going blind.

317
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:33,760
They were just going blind.

318
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:39,120
And so the academia, the public education system

319
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:40,720
of this great nation of ours,

320
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:45,040
sort of enforced the second rule set

321
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:46,480
and taught that to my generation

322
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:49,360
so that our perfect peepers would remain.

323
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:51,760
And then when that started to get boring,

324
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:53,600
they introduced pogs.

325
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:55,200
They actually recorded a lot of,

326
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:56,880
there was a lot of public awareness.

327
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:57,760
The same people who did,

328
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:00,080
I'm not gonna play Sun City,

329
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:01,920
did a tribute song.

330
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:04,000
If you care, please don't stare.

331
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:08,160
That was kind of swept the airwaves.

332
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:11,520
Lionel Richie, I think, co-wrote that with Andrew Dice Clay,

333
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:12,560
which was kind of a weird pair.

334
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:15,520
And then there was the one, stop and think

335
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:16,800
and then take a blink.

336
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:17,360
Yeah, right.

337
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:18,400
I really liked that one.

338
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:19,680
Who co-wrote that, Trav?

339
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:20,880
Because I was trying to remember.

340
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:25,440
I think that was Elton John and Billy Joel together.

341
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:26,320
It was amazing.

342
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:27,760
Okay, yeah.

343
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:33,840
There was a redo of the Donald O'Connor song,

344
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:34,560
Make Them Laugh,

345
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:36,000
called Make Them Laugh,

346
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:39,040
colon the new rule set for staring contest.

347
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:40,000
Right.

348
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:42,640
For God's sake, make them laugh.

349
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:43,520
Who co-wrote that?

350
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:44,240
I forget.

351
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:46,080
It was originally written by Donald O'Connor,

352
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:50,960
but the new version was written by Rosie O'Donnell.

353
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:51,840
And Donald Loege.

354
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:53,920
That's weird.

355
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:54,480
That's weird.

356
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:56,560
And I know that there was another one,

357
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:03,600
song for about blinking.

358
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:07,600
Laugh.

359
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:09,440
And that one was by Tears for Fears.

360
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:14,000
That one was by Tears for Fears and an Infant Lady Gaga.

361
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:17,360
Embryo Gaga.

362
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:20,240
I basically wanted to say Infant Lady Gaga

363
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:22,960
and didn't come up with the part with the song.

364
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:25,600
So I kind of, I don't know if you guys could notice,

365
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:27,600
but I kind of flubbed my way through that.

366
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:29,280
No, no, you totally covered it.

367
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:29,840
Malcolm to the-

368
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:30,400
Did I nail it?

369
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:32,320
The Mabim Bam Sausage Factory.

370
00:15:33,520 --> 00:15:35,760
We're taking you inside with director's commentary.

371
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:37,120
Going deep.

372
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:38,880
2012, deep cut.

373
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:42,480
Sorry, guys.

374
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:43,440
I've got a lot of coughs.

375
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:45,520
You should get all those coughs out.

376
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:46,240
Find a head cold.

377
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:46,960
I'm zinking up.

378
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:48,960
You know, I'm doing everything.

379
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:50,240
I got my Akai.

380
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:51,760
I got my Blackberry.

381
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:52,800
It is pronounced Acai.

382
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:54,640
Acai.

383
00:15:54,640 --> 00:15:55,120
Okay.

384
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:55,840
I got my Akai.

385
00:15:55,840 --> 00:15:56,720
I got my Blackberry.

386
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:58,080
I got everything that I need.

387
00:15:58,080 --> 00:15:58,720
Can I make a rec?

388
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:00,080
Yeah, please.

389
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:01,040
Can I drop a rec on you?

390
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:02,320
Hit me.

391
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:02,800
Goji.

392
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:04,240
Goji.

393
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:04,960
Goji?

394
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:08,000
Oh, it tastes like fish jizz,

395
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
but oh, man, is it gonna-

396
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:10,880
Let's call the row.

397
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:13,520
It is going to fix you up right.

398
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:16,080
And then maybe you need to get flavor blasted.

399
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:18,720
You can flavor blast the goji.

400
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:21,840
I haven't found anything that you can put in the goji

401
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:23,040
to make it palatable,

402
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:25,280
but good luck to you.

403
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:26,400
Yeah.

404
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:28,880
Hey, one of my best friends wants me

405
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:30,960
to take a trip to Chicago with her.

406
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:32,080
I've never been there before,

407
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:33,520
and it seems like a pretty cool place,

408
00:16:33,520 --> 00:16:34,800
to which I'm sure Griffin could attest.

409
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:35,520
Yep.

410
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:38,000
So naturally, I'm totally down.

411
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,200
However, there's a twist.

412
00:16:39,760 --> 00:16:41,840
My friend is planning on bringing her boyfriend,

413
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:43,440
and now I'm wondering whether or not

414
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:44,880
I should really be going.

415
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:46,000
Can you guys please advise me

416
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,800
on how to navigate the perils of third wheeledom,

417
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:52,960
and whether a trip I'd like to take

418
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:54,640
is worth the potential awkwardness

419
00:16:54,640 --> 00:16:55,840
that could be incurred?

420
00:16:55,840 --> 00:16:58,400
And that's from the Vancouver Voyager.

421
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:01,360
Important detail here that they left out.

422
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:03,120
This is a guy asking the question.

423
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:04,640
Okay.

424
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:08,160
So it's a guy and his female best friend,

425
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:09,200
and her boyfriend.

426
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:11,200
Oh yeah.

427
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:13,680
Oh God, I'm so glad you clarified,

428
00:17:13,680 --> 00:17:15,680
because yes, that is going to be kind of weird.

429
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:16,000
Yes.

430
00:17:17,040 --> 00:17:18,800
So it's more like the Vancouver Voyer.

431
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:20,560
Yes.

432
00:17:20,560 --> 00:17:22,000
He plays his cards right.

433
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,760
Now, this is the one,

434
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:25,120
before we get too into it,

435
00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:26,240
I will say this.

436
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:28,560
If the friend invited you first,

437
00:17:28,560 --> 00:17:30,480
and the plan was like the two of you as friends

438
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:31,600
were gonna go to Chicago,

439
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:33,920
and then the boyfriend got invited along,

440
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:36,400
that's a different situation

441
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:39,520
than, hey, my boyfriend and I are gonna go to Chicago.

442
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:40,880
Would you like to go with us?

443
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:42,000
And it depends on,

444
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:43,280
see, here's the thing.

445
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:47,280
It depends entirely on what kind of dude the boyfriend is.

446
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:47,760
Yeah.

447
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:50,000
And the fact that you're writing us to ask

448
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,760
makes me think that he's not the kind of dude

449
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:53,120
that you wanna go on a road trip with,

450
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:54,800
with his girlfriend, right?

451
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:56,720
Like, if it's just a cool guy who's like,

452
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:58,880
yeah, man, whatever, let's go hang out.

453
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:00,560
All three of us, come on, we'll go see a movie.

454
00:18:00,560 --> 00:18:03,280
Yeah, is it gonna be like Ferris Bueller's Day Off?

455
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:03,600
Yeah.

456
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:04,400
You're Cameron.

457
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:05,920
Oh, perfect.

458
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:06,480
Right?

459
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:08,640
I'll tell you the kind of guy he is.

460
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:10,160
He's the kind of guy who said,

461
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:12,560
you're going to Chicago with Kevin?

462
00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:14,000
Yeah, right, I'm coming with you.

463
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:14,640
Oh, that's true.

464
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:16,560
I can't leave you on watch, that's what happened.

465
00:18:16,560 --> 00:18:18,320
That's how it shook out, 100%.

466
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:20,240
So I would guess, just to infer here,

467
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:23,360
that the girl and the boyfriend

468
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:25,440
have only been together like six months.

469
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:29,920
Oh my God, we are fucking Sherlocking this.

470
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:30,800
I know, right?

471
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:32,160
I've been reading How to the Baskervilles

472
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:32,720
and I'm on point.

473
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:34,880
We are giving this the Cumberbatch treatment.

474
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:38,960
So I would say like,

475
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:42,640
even if there were no layers of like being a third wheel,

476
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:45,760
you don't want to go because I don't think this guy likes you.

477
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:47,680
Or at least he doesn't trust his girlfriend with you

478
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:48,800
or something along the lines where

479
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:53,520
it's awkward for levels I don't even think you realize yet.

480
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:55,520
It is a trip you'd like to take,

481
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:57,440
but if it's really a trip you'd like to take,

482
00:18:57,440 --> 00:18:58,880
you wouldn't be asking us about it.

483
00:18:58,880 --> 00:18:59,200
Yeah.

484
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:00,240
You would just be going.

485
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:02,960
There's something deep down in you that knows

486
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:04,960
you're not going to have a fun time.

487
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:05,920
It's going to be weird.

488
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:06,320
Yeah.

489
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:08,240
Also, if you're planning on fucking going

490
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:11,760
in the middle of February, stop.

491
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:13,200
Like don't do that.

492
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:14,640
Chicago's awful then.

493
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:15,600
Also-

494
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:18,640
I went in April and it was still pretty brutal.

495
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:20,720
Yeah, wait until July or something.

496
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:22,560
That's when that city starts popping off.

497
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:25,120
Man, if you really want to go, you could still go.

498
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:29,040
It's not like it's a hard to get to destination,

499
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:29,360
you know?

500
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:30,960
If you're like, you know, I really want to go,

501
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:32,720
I really want to visit Chicago,

502
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:36,720
but maybe this opportunity isn't the opportunity for you.

503
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:38,720
Maybe you set up your own trip with a friend.

504
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:41,120
I thought you were restating for her

505
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:43,280
that even if we said she couldn't go,

506
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:44,480
she could still go.

507
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:44,720
Like-

508
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:46,160
No, no, no.

509
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:47,520
What we say is binding.

510
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:48,960
Our word is law.

511
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:51,360
Legally binding decision that we're making here.

512
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:52,720
Hey, he wrote in.

513
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:53,760
This was his mistake.

514
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:55,280
You shouldn't have asked if he wanted to go.

515
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:56,560
Right.

516
00:19:56,560 --> 00:20:01,440
If you're just worried because of the social norms,

517
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:03,280
it really depends on the dude.

518
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:06,560
So if the dude's cool, then there's no reason not to.

519
00:20:06,560 --> 00:20:08,720
But I think you know the dude's not cool.

520
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:09,360
Yeah.

521
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:11,120
Also, the sleeping arrangement.

522
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:12,960
What's the housing?

523
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:14,160
Are you staying like in a hotel?

524
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:16,240
Or do you guys know people there?

525
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:17,360
Or what's the deal?

526
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:19,520
Because if you're staying in a hotel and all three of you

527
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:20,560
are going to be sharing a room,

528
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:24,160
I think that is the deal breaker right there.

529
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:24,400
Yeah.

530
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:26,080
Yeah, I really do.

531
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:29,440
I mean, like, you know if it's going to be good or not.

532
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:32,560
Like, you know, trips are expensive

533
00:20:32,560 --> 00:20:33,760
and they take a long time.

534
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:38,000
So if you have doubts now, like, just hold off.

535
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:38,560
Yeah.

536
00:20:38,560 --> 00:20:41,680
Wait till they break up and then swoop on her.

537
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:41,920
Yeah.

538
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:45,840
I mean, you know the situation better than we do.

539
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:47,200
And the fact that you wrote in-

540
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:48,880
I think it's never stopped us before.

541
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:49,440
That's true.

542
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:51,840
But I think that we can all agree that the fact that this guy

543
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:55,280
wrote in and asked means he knows the answer is not to go.

544
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:57,200
But Chicago's so dope though.

545
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:57,840
Yeah.

546
00:20:57,840 --> 00:20:59,200
So go another time.

547
00:20:59,200 --> 00:20:59,440
Go by yourself.

548
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:00,720
Not in February.

549
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:01,680
Yeah, go by yourself.

550
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:03,840
Strike up a conversation with somebody.

551
00:21:04,560 --> 00:21:06,480
Just have you ever seen Midnight in Paris?

552
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:08,240
Just be like that, Midnight in Chicago.

553
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:11,840
Or Lost in Translation and go and meet Scarlett Johansson.

554
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:14,320
Or Before Sunrise, Before Sunset.

555
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:14,880
Both of them.

556
00:21:16,560 --> 00:21:19,280
Fall in love with a stranger on the L train.

557
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:20,640
It's going to happen for you.

558
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:22,320
Big things, 2012, 20 does.

559
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:25,680
Upton Sinclair, he's from Chicago, right?

560
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:26,560
I don't know.

561
00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:28,080
Sure, I think he had John Updike.

562
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:29,760
I can never keep the two of them straight.

563
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:30,000
Yeah.

564
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,320
Guys, this Yahoo answer was-

565
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:34,000
Should we Yahoo it?

566
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:37,680
Yeah, I was about to ask you for one and then you fucking incepted me.

567
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:38,240
All right, shh.

568
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:38,880
I love it.

569
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:40,560
This Yahoo was sent in by Lisa Holifield.

570
00:21:40,560 --> 00:21:41,680
Thank you, Lisa.

571
00:21:41,680 --> 00:21:44,800
Lisa is becoming, quickly, our top gold contributor.

572
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:57,760
This question was asked by Rezxion, R-E-Z-X-I-A-N, Rezxion, or perhaps Rezxion.

573
00:21:58,640 --> 00:21:59,200
Oh no.

574
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:00,640
Rezxion.

576
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:05,760

579
00:22:11,040 --> 00:22:14,800
What's up with these basic bitches?

580
00:22:18,560 --> 00:22:23,040
Rezxion asks, if you could assassinate any of the characters of Saved by the Bell,

581
00:22:23,040 --> 00:22:24,080
who would it be and how?

582
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:31,360
Zack, Slater, Screech, Kelly, Lisa, Jessie, or Mr. Belding?

583
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:37,760
I feel like that's really limiting because you're leaving out Max and Tori and whatever

584
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:40,960
the character was that King or Queen's wife played.

585
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:44,080
Oh, somebody did some quick Google research, I think.

586
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:45,360
I did.

587
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:47,760
I'm looking at the Saved by the Bell Wiki right now.

588
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:51,120
Makes me sad that that exists, but go on.

589
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:55,680
I've been saved by the internet and what was her name?

590
00:22:55,680 --> 00:22:56,400
Leah Remney.

591
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:57,120
Who did you play?

592
00:22:58,240 --> 00:22:58,800
She played-

593
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:04,800
This is a really good video.

594
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:05,680
I'm going to save.

595
00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:06,800
Doesn't matter.

596
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:08,320
Stacey Kurosi.

597
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:09,920
Yeah, Kurosi.

598
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:10,400
There it was.

599
00:23:13,040 --> 00:23:18,960
I would have to go with probably A.C. Slater.

600
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:19,680
Oh my God.

601
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:21,200
Why would you kill A.C. Slater?

602
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:22,320
You actually answered it.

603
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:24,640
Yeah, why would I kill A.C. Slater?

604
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:26,960
I don't know.

605
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:31,600
It would be like traveling back in time to kill Hitler when he was a baby.

606
00:23:32,560 --> 00:23:36,560
I would kill A.C. Slater so that he couldn't go on to host all the Miss America past.

607
00:23:36,560 --> 00:23:38,000
And do all that genocide.

608
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,920
Do all that preppy related genocide.

609
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:42,960
I'm sorry.

610
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:44,800
That was in Saved by the Bell the college years.

611
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:47,280
You probably didn't get to that subplot.

612
00:23:48,560 --> 00:23:49,840
I'll probably get to that here in a little bit.

613
00:23:50,560 --> 00:23:54,480
Can I kill all of the cast members of Saved by the Bell the new class?

614
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:57,440
For their own good.

615
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:58,640
Not the college years.

616
00:23:58,640 --> 00:23:59,680
No, there was college years.

617
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:01,520
There was college years and there was also new class.

618
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:07,440
Well, you know, the funny thing about this is that this is actually how Good Morning

619
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:10,480
Miss Bliss ended was with the assassination of Miss Bliss.

620
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:14,000
And it was the catalyst of Saved by the Bell.

621
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,200
That's how Saved by the Bell started.

622
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:16,800
As I'm going over this-

623
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:18,800
Hayley Mel's character Miss Bliss was assassinated.

624
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:22,880
As I'm going over this wiki, one of my favorite things that I've learned is that

625
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:28,960
the creators and writers and the producers and everything don't give two shits about

626
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:31,600
continuity in the Saved by the Bell universe.

627
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:36,640
Cause like, so they, they canceled Good Morning Miss Bliss after like 12 episodes and relaunched

628
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:37,600
it to Saved by the Bell.

629
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:42,560
And so then when they sold it into syndication, they just kind of wrapped the Good Morning

630
00:24:42,560 --> 00:24:44,640
Miss Bliss episodes into it.

631
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:45,440
And they're like, fuck it.

632
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:46,640
No one will notice.

633
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:48,000
And nobody did.

634
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,120
They're kids, Donald.

635
00:24:49,680 --> 00:24:50,240
They're kids.

636
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:52,640
Kids are stupid.

637
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:57,680
They just love Zach's hair and they love romance between him and Kelly Kapowski.

638
00:24:57,680 --> 00:25:00,400
You see, he said time out and he had like a phone and shit.

639
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:01,280
It's awesome.

640
00:25:01,280 --> 00:25:05,920
But I would, I would of course assassinate Zach because you do that, the infrastructure

641
00:25:05,920 --> 00:25:07,280
crumbles and you can slip in there.

642
00:25:07,280 --> 00:25:08,800
And then you're the cool guy.

643
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:10,160
You can't let anyone know you did it.

644
00:25:10,160 --> 00:25:15,280
What you're failing to take into account, Justin, is that all of this is the dream of

645
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:17,520
Zach Morris.

646
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:19,280
Oh shit.

647
00:25:19,280 --> 00:25:24,240
He's staring into a snow globe while his dad and mom sit in the corner going, he just

648
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:29,280
stares at it all day long when he when he freezes time.

649
00:25:29,280 --> 00:25:31,120
He actually is talking to his therapist.

650
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:36,960
Yeah, we need to consider this question a little more deeply because you don't.

651
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:37,360
Hold on.

652
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:38,080
Sorry to interrupt.

653
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:43,440
Is it possible that all the characters on Saved by the Bell represent different aspects

654
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:49,760
of Zach Morris's psyche and Screech is like his nerdy, like self-conscious side and Jesse

655
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:54,960
is like his empowered feminist side and A.C. Slater is like his jock, like, you know, powerful

656
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:55,680
manly side.

657
00:25:55,680 --> 00:25:57,360
Mr. Belding is his impotent side.

658
00:25:58,800 --> 00:26:02,480
His bonerless side and Max is his magician side.

659
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:08,720
I think the problem with your theory is that Lisa Turtle was on the show and I think we

660
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:10,720
can all agree that Zach did not have a black side.

661
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:13,760
Okay, you got me.

662
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:15,360
There's no, there's nothing.

663
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:16,960
You fo' told through my theory.

664
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:23,840
Let's let's back up really quick because first off, I don't think you assassinate a Saved

665
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:24,720
by the Bell character.

666
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:26,400
I think you can only murder them.

667
00:26:27,040 --> 00:26:32,320
I think I think if you kill Zach or A.C. Slater, it's a murder and not an assassination.

668
00:26:33,040 --> 00:26:33,600
Right?

669
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:34,400
What's the difference?

670
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:38,160
I thought you were going to say that you can't murder them because they're all vampires.

671
00:26:39,040 --> 00:26:41,760
Well, that but I don't only slay them.

672
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:48,080
You assassinate a king or a political figure, but you murder a high school student.

673
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:50,640
I would assassinate Senator Zach Morris.

674
00:26:52,560 --> 00:26:58,240
I mean, to be to be fair, Zach is basically the king of Bayside High.

675
00:26:58,800 --> 00:27:01,520
I think he may have even referred to himself as such.

676
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:03,040
Justin, point of order.

677
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:07,760
If you remember, Zach is actually of Native American descent, so he would have been chief

678
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:08,640
of Bayside High.

679
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:10,800
Ah, that's true.

680
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:16,880
That's just that's as we learned from the terrific episode in which Zach ran track for

681
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:18,400
all of one episode.

682
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:20,160
Yeah, he got their kids.

683
00:27:20,160 --> 00:27:23,120
Donald won't notice the kids.

684
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:24,080
They all look the same.

685
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:27,760
That's actually how the high school wars were started.

686
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:34,960
Is that Archduke Zach Morris was assassinated by one of the cast of the cast of California

687
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:38,960
Dreams actually assassinated Archduke Zach Morris.

688
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:44,880
And that was the start of and the problem is, is that the kids from California Dreams

689
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:51,280
had a signed treaty with the cast of Hang Loose that in the event of war, you have to

690
00:27:51,280 --> 00:27:52,160
fight with us.

691
00:27:52,160 --> 00:27:56,240
And, you know, pretty soon it just got rid of the Zach attack proclamation.

692
00:27:57,440 --> 00:27:57,680
Right.

693
00:27:57,680 --> 00:27:58,400
That's correct.

694
00:27:58,400 --> 00:27:59,200
All recall.

695
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:04,000
Let's play a game called the shot heard around Bayside.

696
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:07,920
Let's play a game called who on Yahoo Answers scares the shit out of me the most.

697
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:09,280
Okay.

698
00:28:09,280 --> 00:28:14,240
Is it best answer submitter art Yana who replies AC Slater?

699
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:16,160
I don't know how, but I'd make it painful.

700
00:28:17,040 --> 00:28:17,440
Whoa.

701
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:18,720
Okay.

702
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:24,080
Is it cutie pie 1987 who says Kelly suffocation on pom poms?

703
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:25,440
Wow.

704
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:27,440
Is it Chris who said screech?

705
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:28,320
I would choke him.

706
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:29,200
I hate his voice.

707
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:31,600
Jesus Christ.

708
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:33,120
Was it James A?

709
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:35,440
It was James A who responded.

710
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:37,680
I would handcuff them all together in a circle.

711
00:28:37,680 --> 00:28:41,600
Then I would stand in the center wearing body armor and drop a live hand grenade.

712
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:44,000
Whoever lived would be subsequently beheaded.

713
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:45,680
Wow.

714
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:47,760
I would watch that movie.

715
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:49,200
Dear internet.

716
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:50,320
This is Travis.

717
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:51,200
We're breaking up.

718
00:28:51,920 --> 00:28:53,120
Jesse's been a good run.

719
00:28:53,920 --> 00:28:54,400
Jesse.

720
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:58,080
I'd make her watch show girls over and over again until she killed herself.

721
00:28:58,800 --> 00:28:59,520
Wow.

722
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:00,480
Hey everybody.

723
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:05,280
Maybe you don't remember, but Saved by a Bow, you loved it.

724
00:29:05,280 --> 00:29:05,920
You were cute.

725
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:06,320
You loved it.

726
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:07,600
You had good times.

727
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:09,120
What's the matter with you?

728
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:14,320
To be fair, Elizabeth Berkley already committed career suicide with Showgirls.

729
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:14,800
So yeah.

730
00:29:14,800 --> 00:29:17,920
And if you're wondering what the number of times she would have to watch Showgirls to

731
00:29:17,920 --> 00:29:20,080
kill herself is, it's 1.2.

732
00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:28,000
Guys, Brynn McDonald 2005 said Jesse, because she was one of the ones who left for most of

733
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:31,760
the show and returned only till the end for Kelly and Zach's wedding.

734
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:33,840
I would have her fall out her window room.

735
00:29:35,040 --> 00:29:35,360
Wow.

736
00:29:36,160 --> 00:29:38,160
Jesse, you fair weather bitch.

737
00:29:39,920 --> 00:29:40,400
Wow.

738
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:41,200
Yeah.

739
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:43,360
She's there when it suits her.

740
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:44,080
Yeah.

741
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:47,760
I would kill Tori Scott because clearly she is a phantasm.

742
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:49,680
We just kill nobody.

743
00:29:49,680 --> 00:29:53,280
Can we not kill anybody on this fictional kids show?

744
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:53,840
You fuck.

745
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:55,840
It's over.

746
00:29:55,840 --> 00:30:02,400
The fact that the show no longer persists, although you know that reunion special is

747
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:03,680
just around the corner.

748
00:30:03,680 --> 00:30:05,600
America's dying for it.

749
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:08,400
You're, of course, not counting my fan fiction, correct?

750
00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:09,360
Oh, no, no, no.

751
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:11,200
That's in a splinter universe.

752
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:11,840
Okay, thank you.

753
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:14,720
That's canon T for Travis.

754
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:17,520
I'm talking about canon B for Bayside.

755
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:23,360
Do you think Dustin Diamond will be allowed into any sort of reunion special after having

756
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:25,680
publicly smeared doo doo on a woman's face?

757
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:29,520
Well, that is so screech.

758
00:30:30,160 --> 00:30:32,080
It is not screech, sir.

759
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:34,320
Something screech would have done in my fan fiction.

760
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:35,200
Sir, I protest.

761
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:38,000
Guys, I'm not kidding you.

762
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,640
There are dozens of answers on here that are like screech.

763
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:41,680
He's so annoying.

764
00:30:42,160 --> 00:30:44,480
You guys don't have to watch screech anymore.

765
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:46,800
You're safe.

766
00:30:46,800 --> 00:30:54,400
If you see screech at all, it's by your own screech because he caused my nightmare.

767
00:30:54,400 --> 00:30:55,440
How was your day?

768
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:56,000
Pretty bad.

769
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,600
It got screeched over.

770
00:30:57,600 --> 00:31:01,120
It's just like he kept, he was in my periphery the whole time.

771
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:03,920
Why haven't I changed my desktop wallpaper?

772
00:31:03,920 --> 00:31:08,080
Maybe these are people talking about how annoying Dustin Diamond is because they're frequent

773
00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:10,320
visitors to the Chipotle in Petaluma.

774
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:17,040
Every time he's like, beans or beef?

775
00:31:17,040 --> 00:31:21,120
And I'm like, I sort of leap across the counter and fucking murder him.

776
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:25,360
Griffin, in those answers, how many of them are like, Zach Morris because I love him so

777
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:27,920
much and if I can't have him, nobody can?

778
00:31:27,920 --> 00:31:30,400
I would want to put him in a jar in my basement.

779
00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:34,000
Nobody did.

780
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:35,280
Nobody?

781
00:31:35,280 --> 00:31:36,720
Mostly just screech or Jesse.

782
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:41,520
I would say Kelly Kapowski and I'd kill her with kisses.

783
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:44,880
And suffocate her with pumpkins.

784
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:46,000
That's just horrifying.

785
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:47,920
No, you took a wrong turn.

786
00:31:47,920 --> 00:31:50,640
My friend just got dumped after a little over a month.

787
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:53,600
His lady seemed to be really great for him, but things just went sour.

788
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:58,000
But now the proper time of morning is over and I need a friend back.

789
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:03,360
Brothers, should I force feed my dear friend his first bite of the recovery sandwich?

790
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:06,240
And that's from Need My Friend in New York City.

791
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:12,240
I think in the rules of the recovery sandwich, I don't think it's something you can force feed.

792
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:13,600
Oh, that's not true.

793
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:14,000
You think?

794
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:17,920
I think by the very nature of the recovery sandwich, it's something somebody's forced

795
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:18,320
feeding you.

796
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:20,080
I think more often than not, it's force fed.

797
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:25,280
Here's my problem with this question, New York City.

798
00:32:25,280 --> 00:32:31,840
The intent is maybe noble, but your motivation is all screwy.

799
00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:32,320
Yeah.

800
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:36,320
Everything I'm hearing from you is about what you need and how you need your friend back

801
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:39,360
and what he is to you.

802
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:49,520
Like if you want him to break out of the funk, it has to be about him wanting him to get

803
00:32:49,520 --> 00:32:53,680
out of it or like him wanting to get out of it or you wanting him to get out of it.

804
00:32:53,680 --> 00:32:57,120
Him wanting to get out of it or you wanting him out of it because it's what's best for

805
00:32:58,080 --> 00:32:58,480
him.

806
00:32:58,480 --> 00:33:00,720
And that's not what I'm hearing right now.

807
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:06,240
Let's all just acknowledge that the elephant in the room, that being that you are probably

808
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:08,480
the reason that his relationship didn't work out.

809
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:10,160
Now, what are you basing that on Griffin?

810
00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:14,640
He needs it so much.

811
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:15,600
He needs him.

812
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:22,400
And when you get a need that is that strong and that deep, you get that's a guaranteed

813
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:23,760
Dupree.

814
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:29,200
Okay, so you're not saying that the end of the he caused it by like cheating with the

815
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:30,000
girl on him.

816
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:31,760
You know, very presence.

817
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:36,240
He I have not seen you, me and Dupree, but I don't think that cheating happens.

818
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:41,200
I just think that there's a there's a there's an anchor that weighs that ship of love down

819
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:44,320
to the bottom of the ocean and that anchor is Dupree.

820
00:33:44,320 --> 00:33:48,240
You know, I also have not seen you, me and Dupree, but I'm almost certain that it doesn't

821
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:52,480
end with the woman leaving and Dupree saying, well, at least we still have each other.

822
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:54,880
Justin, did you see you, me and Dupree?

823
00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:56,320
Can you clear this up for us?

824
00:33:57,360 --> 00:33:58,560
I saw Marmaduke.

825
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:03,840
And at the end of that, he's a dog acting like a human.

826
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:07,920
I thought you were going to say at the end of that, he gives a synopsis of you, me and

827
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:08,800
Dupree.

828
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:13,520
At the end of it, he's like, well, I guess we've all learned a lot here, but not as much

829
00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:15,840
as I learned watching you, me and Dupree.

830
00:34:15,840 --> 00:34:20,160
In that charming film, Mr. Sarah Owen Wilson.

831
00:34:20,720 --> 00:34:21,200
So wait.

832
00:34:21,200 --> 00:34:22,800
OK, I need a whole backup.

833
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:24,480
You, me and Dupree.

834
00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:26,240
Marmaduke.

835
00:34:26,880 --> 00:34:27,280
Gotcha.

836
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:29,840
And the one where he-

837
00:34:29,840 --> 00:34:31,760
No, Marley and Me.

838
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:33,680
What is what is his game?

839
00:34:33,680 --> 00:34:35,120
What what is he playing at?

840
00:34:35,120 --> 00:34:39,280
Marley and Me is like a remix of those two movies, but it came out before Marmaduke.

841
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:41,680
What's his story?

842
00:34:41,680 --> 00:34:43,920
Wait, is Marmaduke in Marley and Me?

843
00:34:43,920 --> 00:34:45,520
Because if so, I'll watch that movie.

844
00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:48,320
No, but it's part of the Marley and Me verse.

845
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:49,040
Right.

846
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:49,920
The Marley verse.

847
00:34:49,920 --> 00:34:50,720
It's canon M.

848
00:34:51,600 --> 00:34:52,560
It's canon M of the Marley verse.

849
00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:56,800
Marmaduke is the Lobo to Marley's Superman.

850
00:34:56,800 --> 00:34:57,040
Right.

851
00:34:57,040 --> 00:35:00,720
You know, have you seen Marley and Me Terrible Twos?

852
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:02,160
Yeah.

853
00:35:02,160 --> 00:35:02,960
Is that a thing?

854
00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:06,400
Yeah, I watched that back to back with Space Buddies.

855
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:11,920
It's a it's a prequel to Marley and Me, even though everybody knows that in Marley and

856
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:13,680
Me, the dog fucking dies.

857
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:17,200
So here's the prequel of this dead ass dog as a puppy.

858
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:21,280
Also, Owen Wilson is there and he's staying at his friend's place with his girlfriend.

859
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:26,480
So back to the recovery sandwich.

860
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:30,160
Back to the recovery sandwich, you philanderer.

861
00:35:31,840 --> 00:35:32,880
That's not the right word.

862
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:33,680
Philanthropist.

863
00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:35,200
You philanthropist.

864
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:42,480
Yeah, I think I think your motivations are whack, but you should still still do this for him.

865
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:44,240
He's he's ready. How long has it been?

866
00:35:45,120 --> 00:35:45,840
A month.

867
00:35:45,840 --> 00:35:46,320
A month.

868
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:47,120
He may not be ready.

869
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:51,520
Yeah, I was gonna say it depends on how long the relationship was.

870
00:35:51,520 --> 00:35:54,240
My friend just got out of a seven year long relationship.

871
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:55,280
It's been a month.

872
00:35:55,280 --> 00:35:56,320
Come on, buddy.

873
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:56,800
I know that.

874
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:59,600
I know what I said a second ago, but he meant, you know what?

875
00:35:59,600 --> 00:36:01,840
He may just be stretching his bachelor legs.

876
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:07,280
You know, he may just be enjoying eating Hot Pockets and watching, you know,

877
00:36:07,840 --> 00:36:10,000
Arnold Schwarzenegger maybe still three o'clock in the morning.

878
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:10,720
What does he care?

879
00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:14,480
Yeah, I know whenever I got dumped,

880
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:19,200
all I did was chew down on some Lean Pockets and watch Junior over and over again.

881
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:23,360
I just watched Twins and cried for so many reasons.

882
00:36:23,360 --> 00:36:26,720
I always knew when Griffin had been eating Lean Pockets and watching Junior

883
00:36:26,720 --> 00:36:28,720
because he called me three in the morning and said,

884
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:29,840
I just want a baby.

885
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:33,760
My biological clock is ticking.

886
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:36,080
I'm 19.

887
00:36:36,080 --> 00:36:39,440
My man womb is barren.

888
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:46,480
I'll never feel what it's like to have a life inside me besides these Lean Pockets.

889
00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:53,360
Is the bigger stretch logically required that a man gets pregnant in that movie

890
00:36:53,360 --> 00:36:55,440
or that Arnold Schwarzenegger is a scientist?

891
00:36:58,800 --> 00:36:59,920
It's harder to believe.

892
00:37:01,120 --> 00:37:02,720
It's sort of like jingle all the way.

893
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:07,120
Is it hard to believe a man would turn a town upside down for a single action figure

894
00:37:07,120 --> 00:37:11,120
and fight Simba for it or that Arnold Schwarzenegger is a dedicated father?

895
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:14,400
What's harder to wrap your mind around?

896
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:17,680
That's the problem with any Arnold Schwarzenegger movie

897
00:37:17,680 --> 00:37:21,920
where he's not like ripping enemy skulls out of their heads.

898
00:37:21,920 --> 00:37:27,040
There's nothing to be said about playing against type, but right, man, I don't buy it.

899
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:29,840
Arnold Schwarzenegger, he's a philanderer, right?

900
00:37:29,840 --> 00:37:30,720
That's right.

901
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:32,240
That's the right thing.

902
00:37:32,240 --> 00:37:33,040
You've done that correctly.

903
00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:34,240
He is also a philanthropist.

904
00:37:34,240 --> 00:37:35,840
I would assume he makes a good deal of money.

905
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:39,200
So maybe make your friend watch Junior.

906
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:40,000
That doesn't help.

907
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:43,520
I think after a month, he may not be ready to get back in the game.

908
00:37:43,520 --> 00:37:44,960
He will let you know.

909
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:47,360
I mean, I just, I don't know.

910
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:48,880
You're right, Travis.

911
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:50,240
It's all about how long the relationship was.

912
00:37:50,240 --> 00:37:50,800
Yeah.

913
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:51,600
A month.

914
00:37:51,600 --> 00:37:52,640
That might be pushing it.

915
00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:57,920
I think you could present the recovery sandwich to him and say like,

916
00:37:57,920 --> 00:38:03,840
hey, I'm thinking about maybe taking a trip to, I don't know, where are you in New York?

917
00:38:03,840 --> 00:38:04,720
Whatever.

918
00:38:04,720 --> 00:38:04,960
Yeah.

919
00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:09,840
So you can say like down to Atlantic city, you know, or maybe someplace that doesn't suck.

920
00:38:09,840 --> 00:38:13,200
But like, sounds like crappy swingers.

921
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:14,960
Yeah.

922
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:17,280
Hey, let's have a shitty swingers moment.

923
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:21,280
But you know, maybe like try to set things up.

924
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:22,960
And if he's like, no, man, I'm not in the mood.

925
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:24,240
I don't want to do it.

926
00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:28,160
I think that it's been short enough that you have to respect that.

927
00:38:29,360 --> 00:38:32,080
That this isn't the time to like drag him out of his house.

928
00:38:32,080 --> 00:38:32,400
You know?

929
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:32,800
I don't know.

930
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:35,600
A month is a long time and you're going to, everyone dies.

931
00:38:35,600 --> 00:38:39,440
So I just take him out to a shitty club and just like, see what happens.

932
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:39,680
Yeah.

933
00:38:39,680 --> 00:38:40,640
Let's just mix it up.

934
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:42,800
And you know what?

935
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:47,360
He's never going to be more attractive to the opposite sex than when he has no interest in

936
00:38:47,360 --> 00:38:48,320
being in a relationship.

937
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:52,240
So now's the time to strike where the iron is.

938
00:38:53,360 --> 00:38:53,920
Lonely.

939
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:54,880
So cold.

940
00:38:54,880 --> 00:38:55,920
So very, very cold.

941
00:38:55,920 --> 00:38:56,480
So cold.

942
00:38:57,200 --> 00:38:58,480
So ice, ice cold.

943
00:38:59,680 --> 00:39:05,920
We have a lot of famous friends that we've helped recover from bad relationships.

944
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:11,280
And the way we ask that they repay us is by sending in a question to us.

945
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:13,920
This week we have a second question by our good buddies,

946
00:39:14,640 --> 00:39:16,880
Chuck and Josh from Stuff You Should Know.

947
00:39:17,840 --> 00:39:20,160
So let's check it out right now.

948
00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:23,280
Hello, this is Josh.

949
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:26,960
And that's Chuck from Stuff You Should Know, the podcast.

950
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:28,240
That's right.

951
00:39:28,240 --> 00:39:31,200
And we have, well, you go ahead, Chuck.

952
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:32,320
I have a question.

953
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:35,760
And guys from my brother, my brother and me, thank you for having us on.

954
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:36,160
Yes, thank you.

955
00:39:36,160 --> 00:39:37,920
And allowing us to ask you this question.

956
00:39:38,640 --> 00:39:43,280
Josh refuses to take part in this question, but I would like to know what the deal is

957
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:44,880
with male grooming.

958
00:39:46,080 --> 00:39:50,880
And I'm not talking about eyebrows and ear hair and nose hair and head hair.

959
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:53,120
I'm talking about other kinds of male grooming.

960
00:39:53,120 --> 00:39:54,480
And again, I want to make this point.

961
00:39:54,480 --> 00:39:55,680
This is Chuck's question.

962
00:39:55,680 --> 00:39:59,280
I reject any participation in this question.

963
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:00,720
But I'm just glad to be on.

964
00:40:00,720 --> 00:40:01,840
I'm looking for tips, guys.

965
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:04,720
Josh, first off, I want to first thank you, gentlemen.

966
00:40:04,720 --> 00:40:07,680
Josh, I want to say you made the right call not getting involved there.

967
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:10,560
Chuck's driving this steamship.

968
00:40:11,360 --> 00:40:13,920
You just need to let him navigate into these waters.

969
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:15,440
But we're here.

970
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:17,280
There's nothing we won't talk about.

971
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:22,560
I don't think you should be ashamed of your flora, as it were.

972
00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:22,800
Nope.

973
00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:27,520
Or if you don't have any down there and haven't been able to your entire life.

974
00:40:27,520 --> 00:40:28,720
That's nothing to be ashamed of.

975
00:40:28,720 --> 00:40:30,480
There's nothing to be ashamed of wearing a merkin.

976
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:32,400
Oh, why?

977
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:33,680
Now, what is that?

978
00:40:33,680 --> 00:40:34,240
A merkin?

979
00:40:34,240 --> 00:40:35,520
It's a pubic wig.

980
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:36,320
You know what it is.

981
00:40:36,320 --> 00:40:37,760
They wear them in the movies.

982
00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:39,120
Yeah, like a hair donut.

983
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:41,120
Oh, no.

984
00:40:41,120 --> 00:40:42,560
Yeah, deal with that image.

985
00:40:42,560 --> 00:40:42,880
Why?

986
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:44,000
Why?

987
00:40:44,720 --> 00:40:45,040
Why?

988
00:40:46,160 --> 00:40:46,960
Why wouldn't you?

989
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:48,480
No, why any of it?

990
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:49,520
Why do you know it?

991
00:40:49,520 --> 00:40:50,320
Why does it exist?

992
00:40:50,320 --> 00:40:51,040
Why do I know it?

993
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:53,600
Why to all?

994
00:40:53,600 --> 00:40:53,840
Why?

995
00:40:54,560 --> 00:40:55,760
It's just why over and over again.

996
00:40:55,760 --> 00:40:57,040
Just across the board why?

997
00:40:57,040 --> 00:40:59,040
What do you think people talk about at Zen Church?

998
00:41:04,080 --> 00:41:09,840
And now as we breathe peacefully and sit quietly, let us think on the humble merkin.

999
00:41:09,840 --> 00:41:10,720
Check this out.

1000
00:41:10,720 --> 00:41:11,360
Merkins.

1001
00:41:13,680 --> 00:41:15,440
What's the deal with merkins?

1002
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:17,360
Consider the merkin, align it.

1003
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:21,600
You know, I didn't really get into World of Warcraft until they let you be a merkin.

1004
00:41:22,560 --> 00:41:26,960
I have a merkin warlock that is just unbeatable.

1005
00:41:29,040 --> 00:41:35,840
Listen, sometimes a lady plays a lady actress in the 70s and they need a merkin down there.

1006
00:41:35,840 --> 00:41:37,040
That's just that's just that.

1007
00:41:37,040 --> 00:41:38,320
What did you think it was, Justin?

1008
00:41:38,320 --> 00:41:39,040
Wedda works?

1009
00:41:39,040 --> 00:41:40,240
Do you think it was Hollywood magic?

1010
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:42,880
CGI, huh?

1011
00:41:42,880 --> 00:41:49,280
So I could I could I could tell the ladies that I'm trying to invent like a merkin bald cap

1012
00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:51,120
and I'm I'm prototyping it.

1013
00:41:51,120 --> 00:41:56,000
Would that be a believable scenario that I could try to put out there on the?

1014
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:57,680
I am learning more about you.

1015
00:41:58,880 --> 00:42:01,920
Are you looking for an excuse to be baby smooth down there?

1016
00:42:03,680 --> 00:42:05,120
Yes, yes.

1017
00:42:05,120 --> 00:42:12,080
I think I either got to go bear bear merkin prototype or horrible fire accident.

1018
00:42:12,080 --> 00:42:16,400
Yeah, oh, but horrible fire accident while saving a child from a burning building.

1019
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:17,200
With my penis.

1020
00:42:17,200 --> 00:42:22,560
Grab on, we got to get out of here.

1021
00:42:22,560 --> 00:42:26,800
The chopper, the ladder hanging from the helicopter isn't long enough.

1022
00:42:27,600 --> 00:42:28,160
I know.

1023
00:42:28,160 --> 00:42:28,720
I know.

1024
00:42:29,920 --> 00:42:30,800
Grab my merkin.

1025
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:36,960
Grab my merkin, oh no, it tore off.

1026
00:42:36,960 --> 00:42:38,480
Superman, you a freak.

1027
00:42:41,520 --> 00:42:44,560
You nasty Superman, nasty.

1028
00:42:47,120 --> 00:42:49,040
Can we give Chuck anything actionable?

1029
00:42:49,040 --> 00:42:50,240
Go with the high top fade.

1030
00:42:51,280 --> 00:42:53,360
OK, I have your basketball number.

1031
00:42:53,360 --> 00:42:54,080
You go down.

1032
00:42:54,080 --> 00:42:57,840
You go down to Earley's Barbershop and tell him you want a number, a number three.

1033
00:42:58,960 --> 00:43:00,160
Number three with burns.

1034
00:43:00,160 --> 00:43:03,280
Number three with burns and a lightning bolt shaved in.

1035
00:43:04,320 --> 00:43:06,000
As I see it, you got two options.

1036
00:43:07,040 --> 00:43:14,880
You either go full blown laissez faire like Van Morrison super bush.

1037
00:43:18,880 --> 00:43:23,680
Or you fucking burn and salt the earth down there.

1038
00:43:24,880 --> 00:43:29,040
You, you, you do psychological warfare down there.

1039
00:43:29,040 --> 00:43:32,720
Yeah, Agent Orange shit.

1040
00:43:34,080 --> 00:43:39,120
Oh, man, I could give real advice, but I just don't want to.

1041
00:43:39,120 --> 00:43:40,240
Yeah, I don't want you to either.

1042
00:43:40,880 --> 00:43:42,640
Fucking weird motherfucker.

1043
00:43:42,640 --> 00:43:44,560
Keep it to yourself and your merkins.

1044
00:43:44,560 --> 00:43:48,160
Ask your partner what style they prefer.

1045
00:43:49,520 --> 00:43:51,120
Oh no, oh no.

1046
00:43:51,120 --> 00:43:59,840
Okay, ask about erotic cornrows.

1047
00:43:59,840 --> 00:44:03,120
What is the most sensuous way I could touch your undercarriage?

1048
00:44:04,400 --> 00:44:11,360
How can I maintain my masculinity in a way that pleases you, my lover?

1049
00:44:13,120 --> 00:44:14,720
Check out this sexy perm.

1050
00:44:15,520 --> 00:44:16,480
I got it permed.

1051
00:44:16,480 --> 00:44:18,080
It's like Gabe Kaplan down there.

1052
00:44:18,080 --> 00:44:21,120
It looks like I got Gabe Kaplan in a scissor hold.

1053
00:44:22,720 --> 00:44:23,600
Oh, Jesus.

1054
00:44:24,160 --> 00:44:26,880
You know, having Gabe Kaplan in a scissor hold is how I won the

1055
00:44:26,880 --> 00:44:29,040
celebrity poker tournament in 1888.

1056
00:44:29,600 --> 00:44:30,160
That's true.

1057
00:44:32,080 --> 00:44:33,120
Can I leave?

1058
00:44:33,120 --> 00:44:34,400
Can we all leave?

1059
00:44:34,400 --> 00:44:36,960
It would be a question that I'd like to ask you.

1060
00:44:38,160 --> 00:44:40,160
Let's, let's do one more Yahoo question.

1061
00:44:40,800 --> 00:44:46,560
This one, this one was sent in by Liam Dines.

1062
00:44:46,560 --> 00:44:47,200
Thank you, Liam.

1063
00:44:47,200 --> 00:44:52,720
It's by Yahoo Answers user Timonator, who asks, how would it make you feel

1064
00:44:52,720 --> 00:44:57,360
if your partner kept constant unblinking eye contact with you during lovemaking?

1065
00:44:58,400 --> 00:45:00,480
He's talking about them f me eyes.

1066
00:45:00,480 --> 00:45:03,760
Yeah, he's also talking about a staring contest.

1067
00:45:04,480 --> 00:45:05,600
Yeah, sexual stare.

1068
00:45:05,600 --> 00:45:08,720
Well, in the animal kingdom, that usually implies a challenge.

1069
00:45:12,080 --> 00:45:13,920
I would feel not good, I guess.

1070
00:45:13,920 --> 00:45:15,120
I guess I would feel sad.

1071
00:45:15,120 --> 00:45:21,360
I guess, I guess I would feel out of place, really put out.

1072
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:25,360
Like if it was a person I cared deeply about and then they dropped that bomb on me,

1073
00:45:25,360 --> 00:45:27,920
like I didn't, I don't know how I'd respond to it.

1074
00:45:27,920 --> 00:45:31,120
If they were doing, I feel like I would just every couple seconds go,

1075
00:45:31,920 --> 00:45:34,320
no, but seriously, is there something I can help you with?

1076
00:45:34,960 --> 00:45:35,600
What do you need?

1077
00:45:36,320 --> 00:45:38,000
What do you need that I'm not providing for you?

1078
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:39,280
Is there something you'd like to share?

1079
00:45:39,280 --> 00:45:41,120
What, what does that look mean?

1080
00:45:41,840 --> 00:45:42,480
I'm gonna go.

1081
00:45:42,480 --> 00:45:47,200
If there is one place I want a lady to look during lovemaking,

1082
00:45:47,200 --> 00:45:50,240
it is above me at the poster of Scott Backlick.

1083
00:45:50,240 --> 00:45:56,080
Scott Backlick gave him a big thumbs up, but just says, you're doing it right.

1084
00:45:56,080 --> 00:46:01,360
When, I, when Griffin was 13, he finally discovered himself

1085
00:46:01,360 --> 00:46:03,520
and turned from an oh boy into an oh man.

1086
00:46:06,480 --> 00:46:07,920
It was a really proud day for all of us.

1087
00:46:07,920 --> 00:46:12,960
I asked this question on Twitter the other day,

1088
00:46:12,960 --> 00:46:16,080
and I don't think anybody took me seriously, but I was watching Quantum Leap

1089
00:46:16,080 --> 00:46:19,680
and it was the first episode, I believe in season two,

1090
00:46:19,680 --> 00:46:22,720
where he jumps into the body of a woman and I asked,

1091
00:46:22,720 --> 00:46:25,200
is it okay to be aroused by that?

1092
00:46:25,200 --> 00:46:26,240
For who, Scott Backlick?

1093
00:46:26,240 --> 00:46:28,720
I mean, obviously it's okay to be aroused by anything,

1094
00:46:28,720 --> 00:46:32,720
but as me, a young heterosexual man,

1095
00:46:32,720 --> 00:46:36,240
is it like, it's like Scott Backlick, but a pretty lady.

1096
00:46:36,240 --> 00:46:38,160
That's the best of both worlds, isn't it?

1097
00:46:38,160 --> 00:46:41,760
Right, because you can hang, you can pilot the Enterprise.

1098
00:46:42,400 --> 00:46:43,760
You could talk to Ziggy.

1099
00:46:43,760 --> 00:46:45,120
Talk to Ziggy, whatever.

1100
00:46:45,120 --> 00:46:46,640
And maybe God?

1101
00:46:46,640 --> 00:46:50,480
It's still unclear.

1102
00:46:50,960 --> 00:46:54,640
Griffin, does he still look like Scott Backlick?

1103
00:46:54,640 --> 00:46:56,960
Is this one of the things where he looks in the mirror and he's the woman?

1104
00:46:56,960 --> 00:47:00,480
Here's the thing, you would have to have some sort of mirror apparatus

1105
00:47:00,480 --> 00:47:01,520
where that's all you saw.

1106
00:47:02,480 --> 00:47:03,120
Wait, wait, wait.

1107
00:47:03,120 --> 00:47:04,480
Or maybe it's not, depending on what the flavor is.

1108
00:47:04,480 --> 00:47:07,360
Wait, are you saying that you wouldn't be able to do it

1109
00:47:07,360 --> 00:47:10,560
unless you could constantly remind yourself visually

1110
00:47:10,560 --> 00:47:12,240
that it is in fact Scott Backlick?

1111
00:47:12,240 --> 00:47:14,160
There's a lot of questions here, okay?

1112
00:47:14,160 --> 00:47:17,600
Let's not just jump to conclusions because, okay,

1113
00:47:17,600 --> 00:47:20,160
he's way bigger than the lady that he was in the movie,

1114
00:47:20,160 --> 00:47:23,760
yet he's still in the episode, but he's still put on her shoes.

1115
00:47:25,120 --> 00:47:27,120
So he must have a lady's body.

1116
00:47:28,480 --> 00:47:31,440
Because Al sees him as the lady and he's aroused by it

1117
00:47:31,440 --> 00:47:32,720
and he doesn't know how to handle it.

1118
00:47:32,720 --> 00:47:35,920
Sort of like the choppy waters I'm navigating right now.

1119
00:47:35,920 --> 00:47:37,040
Right.

1120
00:47:37,040 --> 00:47:38,160
Because he sees the lady.

1121
00:47:39,840 --> 00:47:41,280
I want to point something out, Griffin.

1122
00:47:41,920 --> 00:47:43,600
The fact that you're struggling with this

1123
00:47:43,600 --> 00:47:46,160
is kind of like the people who still want to kill Screech.

1124
00:47:47,520 --> 00:47:50,240
You don't have to be encountering this quandary right now.

1125
00:47:51,200 --> 00:47:53,680
I watched this episode yesterday.

1126
00:47:53,680 --> 00:47:55,120
Griffin, is it possible?

1127
00:47:55,120 --> 00:47:59,920
I feel like this is something you could easily just pretend away,

1128
00:47:59,920 --> 00:48:03,040
you know, just have a girl say, hey, I'm really Scott Backlick,

1129
00:48:03,600 --> 00:48:04,000
or pray it away.

1130
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:05,440
I think I'm just going to have to,

1131
00:48:05,440 --> 00:48:07,280
does anybody have the contact information

1132
00:48:07,280 --> 00:48:09,120
for executive producer Donald Bellissari?

1133
00:48:10,080 --> 00:48:11,200
Just do what I do.

1134
00:48:11,200 --> 00:48:13,840
Go to the set of NCIS and wait to be cast as a corpse.

1135
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:17,920
That's usually how I connect with him.

1136
00:48:17,920 --> 00:48:21,200
It's sort of like the bat signal for really untalented people.

1137
00:48:23,040 --> 00:48:24,720
Can I just call up Scott Backlick?

1138
00:48:24,720 --> 00:48:26,240
I bet he could talk me through this.

1139
00:48:26,240 --> 00:48:28,720
I bet he's handled this situation before.

1140
00:48:28,720 --> 00:48:35,280
If you've got, oh, you got a bag case of the number 26s, huh?

1141
00:48:35,280 --> 00:48:36,080
All right.

1142
00:48:36,080 --> 00:48:38,800
Scott, I might be in love with you.

1143
00:48:38,800 --> 00:48:39,120
Help.

1144
00:48:40,240 --> 00:48:42,240
Does Scott Backlick have his own advice podcast

1145
00:48:42,800 --> 00:48:44,000
that we can reach out to?

1146
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:45,680
My Backlick, my Backlick, and me.

1147
00:48:48,960 --> 00:48:50,720
I actually worked with him on

1148
00:48:50,720 --> 00:48:52,960
It's Not Worth The Prize If You Can't Shut Your Eyes,

1149
00:48:52,960 --> 00:48:59,840
a tribute song that the two of us wrote back a long time ago,

1150
00:48:59,840 --> 00:49:03,040
so back when everybody discovered that was making you blind.

1151
00:49:03,040 --> 00:49:04,560
So I could probably get in touch with him.

1152
00:49:04,560 --> 00:49:07,040
I've only got his pager number,

1153
00:49:07,040 --> 00:49:09,360
so we'll have to hope that that's fine.

1154
00:49:09,360 --> 00:49:13,040
Backlick's having a little trouble moving into the 23th century.

1155
00:49:13,040 --> 00:49:15,040
Well, and what's funny is to get his pager to work,

1156
00:49:15,040 --> 00:49:18,320
he has to whack it with the palm of his hand every so often.

1157
00:49:18,320 --> 00:49:18,560
Yeah.

1158
00:49:19,280 --> 00:49:20,720
What if that, you know that's it,

1159
00:49:20,720 --> 00:49:23,840
by the way, you know that's his ringtone, you know it 100%.

1160
00:49:26,320 --> 00:49:28,960
So this has been our advice podcast

1161
00:49:28,960 --> 00:49:34,160
slash Baccala fanfic slash testicular grooming show.

1162
00:49:35,520 --> 00:49:38,640
Another point, is it Baccala or Baccala like Dracula?

1163
00:49:38,640 --> 00:49:40,240
It's Baccala like Dracula.

1164
00:49:40,240 --> 00:49:42,400
Okay, because I say Baccala and that's a point of some kind.

1165
00:49:42,400 --> 00:49:44,800
I honestly, Gervin, I think to each his own.

1166
00:49:44,800 --> 00:49:45,040
Yeah.

1167
00:49:45,600 --> 00:49:47,680
I feel like a Baccala would be cool either way.

1168
00:49:47,680 --> 00:49:48,480
Demanded a motto.

1169
00:49:48,480 --> 00:49:51,520
Yeah, so thank you so much for listening.

1170
00:49:52,080 --> 00:49:54,000

00:50:18,880 --> 00:50:20,880
which is about, or ghost boss,

1180
00:50:20,880 --> 00:50:22,400
which is about exactly what you'd expect.

1181
00:50:23,840 --> 00:50:26,880
Best way to get the inside scoop on those and those go live

1182
00:50:26,880 --> 00:50:29,840

It's at nbmbam.

1186
00:50:35,920 --> 00:50:38,400
I want to thank John Roderick and the Long Winters

1187
00:50:38,400 --> 00:50:40,640
for the use of our theme song, It's a Departure,

1188
00:50:40,640 --> 00:50:43,440
which plays at the beginning of our show and is incredible.

1189
00:50:43,440 --> 00:50:46,080
You can listen to that, Jim, and other Jims like it

1190
00:50:46,080 --> 00:50:47,520
on the album Putting the Days to Bed,

1191
00:50:48,320 --> 00:50:50,480
which I expect everybody owns at this point,

1192
00:50:50,480 --> 00:50:52,480
but if not, get you some.

1193
00:50:53,200 --> 00:50:55,680
And I'd like to thank our buddies Chuck and Josh

1194
00:50:55,680 --> 00:50:57,680

1195
00:50:57,680 --> 00:50:59,360

00:50:59,360 --> 00:51:01,280
If you've never checked it out, do it now.

1197
00:51:01,920 --> 00:51:02,560

They just did an episode on the moon

1199
00:51:04,880 --> 00:51:06,640
not too long ago that I listened to.

1200
00:51:06,640 --> 00:51:08,000
So if you'd like to spend a half hour

1201
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:09,200
thinking about Portal 2,

1202
00:51:10,240 --> 00:51:12,480

Jeff Shearer, all of our dear friends

1215
00:51:51,600 --> 00:51:53,120
who tweet with the IBM hashtag.

1216
00:51:53,760 --> 00:51:55,760
We really, really, really appreciated it.

1217
00:51:55,760 --> 00:51:56,720
Thank you all.

1218
00:51:56,720 --> 00:51:59,200
We appreciated it and continue to appreciate it.

1219
00:52:00,080 --> 00:52:02,160
And may appreciate it in the future.

1220
00:52:02,160 --> 00:52:02,880
It's hard to say.

1221
00:52:02,880 --> 00:52:09,040
Okay, and keep an eye out for something

1222
00:52:09,040 --> 00:52:11,280
that may be coming out this week.

1223
00:52:13,040 --> 00:52:13,840
Can we tease it?

1224
00:52:14,800 --> 00:52:25,200
I think something of the more musical variety, maybe?

1225
00:52:25,200 --> 00:52:28,000
Keep it locked to our Twitter feed and find out.

1226
00:52:28,960 --> 00:52:31,120
There will be a little bit of chopping

1227
00:52:31,120 --> 00:52:33,360
and a little bit of screwing.

1228
00:52:33,360 --> 00:52:35,920
And if you play it at the right time with your lady,

1229
00:52:35,920 --> 00:52:37,120
a lot of bit of screwing.

1230
00:52:38,240 --> 00:52:39,440
Tot stuff.

1231
00:52:39,440 --> 00:52:41,680
And if you're a psychopath murderer,

1232
00:52:41,680 --> 00:52:43,280
a lot of chopping too.

1233
00:52:44,720 --> 00:52:45,760
But follow us.

1234
00:52:45,760 --> 00:52:47,600
And you might want to follow our friend Rocky Horror.

1235
00:52:47,600 --> 00:52:48,640
Because I don't know.

1236
00:52:48,640 --> 00:52:50,880
Maybe he's a cool guy.

1237
00:52:50,880 --> 00:52:53,120
He's a cool guy and there's no other reason.

1238
00:52:57,280 --> 00:52:58,480
We haven't mentioned it in a while,

1239
00:52:58,480 --> 00:53:02,800
but if you want to subscribe and rate and review on iTunes,

1240
00:53:02,800 --> 00:53:04,640
we continue to appreciate that as well.

1241
00:53:04,640 --> 00:53:05,200
It's cool too.

1242
00:53:06,640 --> 00:53:07,760
And that's everything?

1243
00:53:08,400 --> 00:53:10,000
Yeah, I'm going to finish it.

1244
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:10,320
Do it.

1245
00:53:10,320 --> 00:53:11,040
I'm going to kill it.

1246
00:53:11,040 --> 00:53:14,000
This final Yahoo, it was sent in by Tim.

1247
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:14,560
Thank you, Tim.

1248
00:53:15,200 --> 00:53:18,080
It's by Yahoo Answers user GoodTimeCharlie who asks,

1249
00:53:18,080 --> 00:53:31,120
How long should I sit on the loo to chase these Tuesday blues away?

1250
00:53:31,120 --> 00:53:51,280
How long should I sit on the loo to chase these Tuesday blues away?

1251
00:53:51,280 --> 00:53:52,400
I'm Griffin McElroy.

1252
00:53:52,400 --> 00:53:54,240
It's been my brother, my brother, and me,

1253
00:53:54,240 --> 00:54:03,040
and it's too bad we're on the same team.

1254
00:54:03,040 --> 00:54:04,720
Keep your heart, Three Stacks.

1255
00:54:04,720 --> 00:54:05,760
Keep your heart.

1256
00:54:05,760 --> 00:54:07,920
Hey, keep your heart, Three Stacks.

1257
00:54:07,920 --> 00:54:08,960
Keep your heart.

1258
00:54:08,960 --> 00:54:10,240
Man, these girls are smart.

1259
00:54:10,240 --> 00:54:12,000
Three Stacks, these girls are smart.

1260
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:27,520
Keep your heart, Three Stacks, keep your heart, Three Stacks, keep your heart, Three Stacks.
