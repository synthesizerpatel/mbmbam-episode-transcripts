1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:30,640
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:47,920
Hello everybody and welcome to my brother my brother made advice show for the modern era.

6
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:51,360
I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy. I'm your middle brother, Travis McElroy.

7
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:55,280
And I'm Craig. I'll be your server this evening. Can I interest you guys in some

8
00:00:55,280 --> 00:01:00,960
magnum shrimp on a crispy toast? Uh actually, Craig, I was looking at the uh

9
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:06,080
do you do the magnum shrimp on like a grilled or maybe like a ceviche?

10
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:09,920
We don't. What is that? You're just using words that we've never heard here at the Applebee's.

11
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:15,680
You never heard the word grilled? We invented the grill. What was the other one? Servicer?

12
00:01:18,160 --> 00:01:22,800
Ceviche? We're here at the Applebee's for Father's Day waiting for Dad to show up

13
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:28,160
um and also celebrating Justin. This is Justin. Happy Father's Day. Thanks guys.

14
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:32,080
Wow, what an honor. I'm a dad. You didn't even ask me. You didn't even ask your old pal Craig

15
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:38,400
about his children. Craig, are you a dad? How many children do you have, Craig? 19.

16
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:46,800
19 children? Yes. You could have more? Human children? Six of those. Six human children.

17
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:50,560
What are the other 13? How many are real doll babies? How many of the what's are what's?

18
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:55,200
How many are real doll babies? Of the of the human children or all of them? It's a complicated

19
00:01:55,200 --> 00:02:00,480
diagram. I hope you're not counting real doll babies. Okay, how many of your human children

20
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:08,880
are real doll babies? None. Pound puppies? Yes. Wait, hold on. Some of your human babies

21
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:15,280
are pound puppies. 13 pound puppies, six real doll human babies. You said none of your babies

22
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:21,120
are real dolls. They're not real dolls. They're CPR test dummies. What can I get you all started

23
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:27,680
with some appetizers? I would like a jalapeno mudslide, please. That's a happening. I would

24
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:33,120
like for your voice to not sound like a malfunctioning talk boy. That's my problem. My

25
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:40,960
brother fed me one at force when I was six. I used a tremendous amount of brother force to get that

26
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:47,360
talk boy down the throat. The battery's been running out for years. In that case, I'll have

27
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:51,200
the steak quesadilla towers. I'm gonna need one of y'all to punch me in the throat to start the

28
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:57,520
rewinding of the tape. Why don't you head on back to the kitchen. I'll rewind the tape and you give

29
00:02:57,520 --> 00:03:02,320
our order. If you see our brother Griffin on the way back from the badmama jamma slamma bamma

30
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:08,320
bathroom, maybe you could. Oh, I forgot my doggone gear notebook again. So I'm gonna need y'all to

31
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:12,880
start over with the food and the drinks that you want to take and consume. You know what, I actually

32
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:18,000
think we're not ready to order yet. We're gonna wait for our dad. That's fair. I'm a dad, y'all

33
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,200
know about that. All right, I'll tell you see talk to y'all later. I'm gonna go hit the drawn.

34
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:30,320
Hey guys. Oh, hey. Did you see Craig on the way? Uh, no. I did see some sort of swamp thing-esque

35
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:34,800
monster and it looked like he had a microphone coming out of his throat. Anyway, uh, should I

36
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:40,640
sit? Where should I sit? Yeah, Griffin, I got you a booster seat. Just pop up right there.

37
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:47,840
Thanks. You know how little my legs are and how short my butt is. Here I go. You're notoriously

38
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:51,440
short butted. Hi everybody, I'm Griffin McElroy. I'm the youngest brother. We have a lot of fun

39
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:55,360
here on the podcast, but today let's talk about something serious. Pennies from heaven. Pennies

40
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:59,840
from heaven. Who knows? I know where they come from, but where do they go? Today, an expose.

41
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:04,640
Didn't you guys recently, you went to Guy Fieri restaurant, didn't you? Yes. How does that stack

42
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:10,720
up compared to this, uh, to this Applebee's? Uh, we haven't eaten this Applebee's yet, but, uh,

43
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:16,160
I'm going to go ahead and go out on a limb and say that this Applebee's is going to be a 20 star

44
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:22,720
dining experience comparatively. If I open my day planner and turn it to today, I have not colored

45
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:28,400
the second half of the day in orange highlighter and just written diarrhea with big block letters

46
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:35,600
on it. Diarrhea would be a blessing for me right now. I had a crazy Hagar cocktail to drink and

47
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:41,360
then I had a bacon mac and cheeseburger, uh, for my entree. Uh, and I haven't been pooping those

48
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:46,000
out as much as they have been sort of bursting from my chest, like a Xenomorph from the alien

49
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:51,040
films. And, um, when they, when they burst out of my chest, it's, it's Mark McGrath from the band

50
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:57,120
Sugar Ray. He grows up to turn into Guy Fieri. Well, at least you didn't force like a Tony

51
00:04:57,120 --> 00:05:03,120
award winning Emmy award winning, just all around great guy to go with you. Well, it was his fucking

52
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:09,600
idea. Remind him of that to the grave. Um, which is tomorrow. Tomorrow is the grave. Thank you for

53
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:13,120
that Lin-Manuel. Your pooping schedule is so much better than mine. Griffin might've been,

54
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:17,840
my Guy Fieri meal has been popping out like guest stars on a Jerry Lewis telephone.

55
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:22,560
Just you never know when it's going. It lasts for two days. You never know when they're somebody

56
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:25,840
else is going to show up. We've had a lot of fun here twice on my brother, my brother and me,

57
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:30,960
the episode that we're on now, the number that I don't know. Um, but this is an important public

58
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:34,240
service announcement. First of all, we're going to get to the bottom of that here in just a bit.

59
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:42,000
Second of all, don't go to Guy Fieri's place as a joke because the joke's on, it's not even on you

60
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,720
because then that would assume that somebody is getting some form and pleasure out of it.

61
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:49,840
I assume Mr. Fieri is getting a lot of money out of it, but it's not even funny bad. It's not,

62
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:57,040
it's not. What I discovered that day is you can't eat ironically. You can't eat things as a goof.

63
00:05:57,040 --> 00:06:02,720
They still go in your human body and stay there. Right. Sure. Um, you also can't eat his pretzel

64
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:08,400
breaded chicken tendos that you can't. It's a, it's a trick and it's a trap to lure tourists.

65
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:14,720
Travis, these chicken tendos were so dry. They came with a honey, they were dry as a popcorn fart

66
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:20,560
and they came with a honey mustard dipping sauce. Griffin was so desperate to get the final, um,

67
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:27,760
remnants of any sort of moisture, any sort of moisture for the chicken that he actually

68
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:34,240
knocked the ramekin across the table and onto the floor, uh, because he was trying so hard to get

69
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:39,520
the last of the dipping sauce out. I was excavating to get that flavor, any juice. Oh, there's gotta be

70
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:45,840
some juice. I was, I was a, uh, a dousing rod for sweet mustard, but instead of falcon, I falcon

71
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:50,720
punched a ramekin across a Guy Fieri steakhouse. The worst part about it is as soon as the ramekin

72
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:56,560
touched the floor, we heard a prerecorded message from Guy Fieri play across the loudspeakers and

73
00:06:56,560 --> 00:07:02,560
he just says, fuck it, play it where it lays. And that's like, apparently anytime you drop food there,

74
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:08,400
yeah, anytime you drop food there, Guy Fieri says, fuck it, play it where it lays. In the Guy Fieri

75
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:14,080
restaurant, they had a recording of him saying, fuck it, fuck it, play it where it lays. I can't believe

76
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:21,680
that's true. I know, it's hard to believe. Fuck that shit. This is Guy Fieri's fuck house. Yeah, and then when you,

77
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:25,600
when you walk in, there's another prerecorded message and it plays and it says, abandon all

78
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:32,320
hope ye who enter here. Now, we're, we're, we're having a lot of fun here, my brother, my brother, and me. We've had three funs so far.

79
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:38,480
This is the same building that had love, peace, and taco grease written, like, on the wall in huge

80
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:44,000
letters. You know the weirdest thing about it? Wasn't that crowded? Got a table right away. No problemo.

81
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:49,440
Um, what are we doing? Paint me a picture. What time was it when you entered the restaurant,

82
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:55,120
were they all, like, sitting around smoking and then they had to, like, oh, oh, hey, oh, hey. I think the

83
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:59,840
time was the time of my life. Do you guys want to do some advice? When I suggest a meeting time with

84
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:03,440
my friend and they decline, who bears the responsibility to suggest a different time?

85
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:09,200
I personally feel obliged to do this if I'm the one vetoing a date, but some of my friends provide

86
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:13,120
no such follow-up and I end up feeling like a control freak when I push the matter.

87
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:19,280
Are my expectations unreasonable? That's from Anxious in Alberta. If it is, if it is a spoken

88
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:26,160
conversation in person and you have both expressed equal amount of interest to do this thing,

89
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:31,760
now it's a back and forth. You say 5 p.m. They can't do 5 p.m. It's now their thing. If it's a thing

90
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:37,840
that you desperately want to do that they've, like, agreed to go do with you, it's your job.

91
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:46,160
See, this is why I don't, I just don't like our measurements of time, how numerical they are.

92
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:51,760
I just wish we could do it, like, um, they used to do it in the olden days or how they do it, like,

93
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:59,760
in, like, a chill sort of oceanside town in Greece where it's just, like, sunset. Come by at sunset.

94
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:03,120
Everyone can get down with that because then it's objective. You got a pretty wide window of time

95
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:08,080
there that you can show up. Come to the, come to the cafe at sunset. Oh, how nice does that sound?

96
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:11,920
Oh, but that gives me such, like, panic shivers now if someone's like,

97
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:18,480
just come by in the afternoon. Uh, is, is, do you mean 1201 or like 430 or?

98
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:22,160
Afternoon represents, like, a good six hour chunk of time. I don't, I don't like that. Tie it to a

99
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:29,520
celestial body is what I'm saying. When the, when the, when the polar star above us, um, shines high

100
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:36,400
in Cerberus's belt, then that is the time that we will go see Jurassic World. Honey, what time are

101
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:40,560
we supposed to have dinner with the Smiths? I, let me pull out my sextant. Hold on one second.

102
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:45,360
Let me get out my sextant. It's at cloud noon. What is cloud, what is cloud noon?

103
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:49,920
That's not real. Yeah, sure. It's when the clouds are at their highest noon. Yes, exactly.

104
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:56,320
It's in the Poor Richard's Almanac. That's a poor, poor Richard though. He doesn't know what he's

105
00:09:56,320 --> 00:10:00,640
talking about. Yeah, I think it's on you. If you, if you're the one saying like, no, that time doesn't

106
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:05,120
work for me, I think the ball's in your proverbial cord at that point. I think that you do have to

107
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:10,960
say like, no, that won't work, but here's this, check this out. I often think that if I suggest

108
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:15,920
a time and someone's like, no, and they don't offer an alternative, like they don't want to do

109
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:20,240
it. Yeah, they get left behind. Right? You don't like, you don't, you don't get to come to Arby's

110
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:26,240
with me. What time do you want to go to Arby's? Like five? No. No. Can I, can I recommend cloud

111
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:34,160
noon? Working sky gold to cloud noon. The sky's illuminated. Time to get to the office until the

112
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:44,000
clouds are shaded by the moon's reprieve. Clouds behind the mountains. If you see the sun glistening

113
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:49,520
all across the fountains. Oh, now, now listen, it's going to be vitally important that there

114
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:53,680
are fountains everywhere in order for you to make your point. You have to do that. Yeah. It's, it's

115
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:59,040
hard to, yeah. How about a Yahoo? Yeah. Let me hit you with this Yahoo. Uh, this one was sent in by

116
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:07,200
Evan Jones Thorn. Thank you Evan Jones Thorn. It's by Yahoo Answers user. Hottie101. H-O-T-I-E 101.

117
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:16,000
Thank you Hottie101 for your bravery. Hottie101 asks, what is a good sumer gob for teens?

118
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:25,920
Uh, summer job I think is the translation from this language, which I believe is Swahili. Uh,

119
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:32,000
what is a good sumer gob for teens? Something that brings in cash, dollars, pretty good business.

120
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:35,200
These are bullet points by the way. Let's start over from the beginning now that you understand

121
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:40,560
the context of this list. Something that brings in cash money. So no volunteer work. Pretty good

122
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:49,200
business. So that one's important. No lemonade field. No lemonade stands though. Those are

123
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:54,160
illegal. Have you seen these stories? Have you seen stories by the way of like cops shutting down

124
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:57,520
lemonade stands? Like, like people actually shutting down lemonade stands because like I

125
00:11:57,520 --> 00:12:02,560
guess they're not like licensed or whatever. This doesn't happen. It's really happening in

126
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:09,360
our America. How old is this teen that they want to bring in good cash money and good business

127
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:15,520
but lemonade stand would even be on the table in some form or fashion? I don't know Travis,

128
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:20,240
but I can give you a six-year range. I can, I can say they are definitely between 13 and 19.

129
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:25,120
For sure. For sure. I hope to God there's not a 19 year old that people are like,

130
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:30,560
you should start a lemonade stand. No, no, forget that. That would be some good ass lemonade.

131
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:36,880
I'm not, I'm not interested in like a, a mix where like there's a, a bottom layer of silt

132
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:41,280
that is just sugar and you don't get to any of that delicious glucose and all you get is

133
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:47,360
yellow water. No, I want that. I want the steady hand of a 19 year old who's been around the block.

134
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:51,920
I was picturing like backward E, you know, like made out of like cardboard and like

135
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:56,320
dowel rod, but maybe it's like a food truck thing. Yeah. If you go to a 19 year old's

136
00:12:57,200 --> 00:13:03,840
lemonade stand, you're going to get some like made with agave nectar, some like cilantro mixed in

137
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:09,440
there. And maybe there's some tequila in it. Yeah. And they're going to have a selection of apps,

138
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:14,240
like some sweet potato with like a, some sort of kimchi sauce on top of it. Oh, I thought you

139
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:22,560
meant like iPhone apps. No. Well, yeah, they have an iPhone app to crush. You get to follow made,

140
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:28,240
the lemonade truck stand. They just call it nade because it's like a hipper cooler version of

141
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:32,960
lemonade. And that's the, pretty much the way to do things these days is just to shorten the word

142
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:38,800
and maybe take one of the vowels out. So it's like n-d and that's n-n-n-d and then maybe like

143
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:47,200
an umlaut over the a. Yeah. Let's hit. I've been mowing this lawn all day. I've worked,

144
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:54,480
been working up a hearty sweat. You know, I could really go for some. Maybe a 19 year old could get

145
00:13:54,480 --> 00:14:03,760
an artisanal lawn mowing job. And it's just, they, they clip it all by hand. No machines used. Very

146
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:10,400
like carbon neutral footprint with plastic safety scissors and free range goats. What if you open

147
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:16,080
your door after hiring a 19 year old to mow your lawn and you open the door to see them holding

148
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:22,000
like 20 ropes connected to 20 goats and they just mouth the words, fuck you. And then you had to

149
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:27,600
give them a thousand dollars. Yeah. And 600 of those dollars are going to a fresh class of,

150
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:32,560
and at the end of the day you go out, the goats are still there. You bought the goats. Yeah.

151
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:36,240
They, those live with you now. But now you have an alternative revenue source and those goats are

152
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:41,360
going to pay you back in full. Oh, goats will pay dividends. Because goats are, goats are good

153
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:44,800
borrowers. They, they, they pay you back with interest in a very timely manner.

154
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:52,960
What would be a good teen summer job? Well, okay. Let's, let's give a little bit of background. You

155
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:57,920
guys tell me your teen summer jobs. What did you guys do when you were teens? I used dog buttholes.

156
00:14:57,920 --> 00:15:03,040
Yeah, Travis had dog buttholes. We've covered that. Super lucrative career. I did mow lawns

157
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:07,440
for a while. Mowed lawns for a while. I remember you not being very good at it. I remember Dave

158
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:11,760
read my dear friend Tommy's dad complaining that you did a bad job. Or was that girl? Oh,

159
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:15,680
that was me. I did not have, I lacked follow through. Yeah, that was me. I was using a push

160
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:20,160
mower, which, which means like you can't really tell that your lawn's been mowed. It's just sort

161
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:25,120
of been combed. I did, I did a good job brushing his lawn for him. You were a great lawn flattener.

162
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:29,920
Yeah. And he would come around and be like, Hey, uh, this sucks. And I'd be like, I know. Money,

163
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:36,560
please. A poor, a poor craftsman blames his tools. So let me just say that my grass, my grass isn't

164
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:41,360
shorter. No, but it is different. Let me get 40 though. Let me get 40 though for that. What do

165
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:46,720
you think? I made it look weird. $40 please. Don't be cinchy on the tip. Some of us littler.

166
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:54,400
And then I got very tired. I worked at blockbuster twice. I, uh, I was a newspaper carrier. I did

167
00:15:54,400 --> 00:16:00,240
that as a teen summer job. Um, you newspaper carried. And I think my mom and dad do so much

168
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:07,280
of the work that they would not allow me to do it. I tried to. Yeah. Yeah. I kind of killed that

169
00:16:07,280 --> 00:16:12,880
golden goose and boy, I was making it hand over fist. I was actually so bad at collecting that

170
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:16,720
in the end when you zeroed everything out, I was pretty much just doing like volunteer work

171
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:22,320
to keep print alive. I had a summer job working for Justin, your father-in-law,

172
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:27,600
the tri data incorporated, um, where I possessed a lot of, I would say natural talent and natural

173
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:32,880
skill, but not a lot of natural showing up and doing it. I did instead possess a lot of natural.

174
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:36,720
I'm going to go to Bonnaroo and just like check out the acts this year. Cause I hear it's going

175
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:40,960
to be tight. So I'm going to need all of that time off work later. And then the next week,

176
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:44,880
there was always another Bonnaroo. There were, there were several Bonnaroo's that summer.

177
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:49,360
Griffin, Griffin worked at the tri data studios where things I bought at sheets is filmed.

178
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:54,000
Mm-hmm. Uh, he worked there for how long did you make that last Griffin before you

179
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:58,640
literally, literally a summer, one summer before my freshman year of college. Yeah.

180
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:02,640
I was a legend. I was a legend. He scanned how many documents,

181
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:07,520
4,000 documents, put them up on the board. There really was a board

182
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:10,880
and 4,000 was actually very low on the number of documents.

183
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:12,240
Yeah. Not a great job.

184
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:15,840
Not a great job. It was a great job. I did a bad job.

185
00:17:15,840 --> 00:17:19,200
You didn't do a great job. Yeah. I did a bad job at it to be clear.

186
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:23,040
But I did lay a lot of the groundwork that things I bought at sheets was built upon.

187
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:26,960
That's true. We still find some of your leavings.

188
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:27,760
And my riddles.

189
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:35,600
I opened a ceiling tile yesterday and riddles just came flying out at me that Griffin had

190
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:39,040
stored there. Yeah. Maybe that explains my low output.

191
00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:46,000
He was too busy filling the plates with riddles. He was too busy national treasuring it.

192
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:50,800
Me and my girlfriend watch a lot and enjoy, I would hope, but you do both of those,

193
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:55,520
a lot of Netflix and Hula together. My girlfriend watched a lot of Netflix and Hula just despise it.

194
00:17:55,520 --> 00:18:01,040
Uh, we enjoy it. And, uh, the only problem is that when we start a show, we both like,

195
00:18:01,040 --> 00:18:04,640
she will continue to watch it while I'm at work and be seven episodes ahead of me by the time I

196
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:09,520
get home. What? I've tried to ask her to wait for me until I get off work and we watch it together,

197
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:15,120
but she continues on in her sin and watches the show while I'm at work. How can I get her to stop

198
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:20,480
and watch the show with me? P.S. My work schedule is 9 a.m. to 9 p.m., so I'm gone a lot of the

199
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:25,520
time. I think your bigger question is, what do I do when my girlfriend dumps me because she does

200
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:29,280
not like me very much? This relationship is headed for rocky waters, my friend.

201
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:32,800
I was going to say just break up with her. Justin, I'm so glad we're on the same page.

202
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:37,280
I don't- this relationship's over. This is like the keystone. It's 2015. Like,

203
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:43,680
keeping your Netflix and Hulu episode count in sync is like the keystone of a happy marriage.

204
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:48,320
If I- I- I saw a new book at the bookstore. It's called, uh, Men Are From Episode 16,

205
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:52,560
Abortions of the New Black, and Women Are From Episode 10, and on the inside of the

206
00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:57,040
book it just says, fuck it. You're hosed. She has to have a show that she wants to

207
00:18:57,040 --> 00:19:03,040
watch that you don't. That's the secret. That's the secret. Is it- to keep this in line, you've

208
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:08,880
gotta have your secret shows that each of you have, and then you have to have these shared shows,

209
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:14,160
because it's not- it's not a question of them wanting to get further ahead. It's not a race.

210
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:18,960
You know, Orange Is The New Black is not the race. Unless she just wants to feel like prescient,

211
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:24,480
like, oh, you'll never know what happens next. Oh, something very exciting is coming.

212
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:31,360
Um, you gotta have your stuff. Rachel's got her scandal. I just- I love Josh Molina. Oh,

213
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:36,640
man, do I love Josh Molina. But it does not seem like my thing. Uh, in the same vein, for me,

214
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:40,560
Twin Peaks. That's not Rachel's thing. That's not gonna be her thing. But if I'm sitting alone,

215
00:19:40,560 --> 00:19:46,640
and she's out, uh, doing a thing, and I'm at home not doing a thing, I'll turn on the Twin Peaks.

216
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:50,320
And that's how we keep ourselves honest when it's time to burn through, you know,

217
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:55,760
Key and Peele or something like that. There is another option that is probably less palatable

218
00:19:55,760 --> 00:20:00,320
for your girlfriend, but that is when you return home, you jump back to where you were,

219
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:05,920
and she has to sit and watch the episode she's already seen. So if she's just doing it as a time

220
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:10,480
filler, like, then you both still get to watch them together, but she gets to keep going.

221
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:15,600
I guarantee if you, like, make her do that a couple times, she'll stop watching them without

222
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:20,800
you, so as not to just have to repeat view them a couple times. Yeah. But it may get old for her.

223
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:25,360
I love, Travis, the supposition you've made that he's gonna be able to tell her

224
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:28,800
anything when it comes to Netflix. Yeah, sure. It sounds like, it sounds like this,

225
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:33,200
this Bronco's done been let out the pen already, and I don't think he's gonna lasso that, that,

226
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:37,040
that, that steed back, back into its, uh, horse pen. How much, how much more? Yeah, keep going.

227
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:41,760
I want more rodeo. Justin and Sydney have been watching a lot of rodeo masters together.

228
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:46,160
It's just in his brain. Let me hit you guys with this business opportunity is fiscal

229
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:54,240
potential promise that I'm making to you. It is a dongle, USB dongle for your device,

230
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:58,880
whatever device you use, uh, that is tied to your accounts. You can tie it to your Netflix

231
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:03,840
account. You can tie it to your Apple TV. You can tie it to your Roku. I don't know. I don't know.

232
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:08,160
All of your devices and your accounts and your boxes and your set top boxes and your devices

233
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:11,920
and your peripherals. And you're going to have a dongle for it. And this dongle has two key holes

234
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:16,080
in it and you each have a key and you have to activate it like a submarine. If you want to

235
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:22,640
watch orange is the new black. I love it, Griffin. That's a wonderful, wonderful concept. I think she

236
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:27,120
would just take his key though. Like you cannot hold this woman back from watching television.

237
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:33,120
The key has a biometric key inside of it as well. Have you not seen leverage? There's a way around

238
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:40,080
all of this because that biometric password is one password. And it's also, you have to provide a

239
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:44,640
stool sample. So yes, yes, it's complicated. It's going to solve your problem, but you're

240
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:49,600
going to have to take a shit every time you want to watch bloodlines or have some lying around,

241
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:52,960
but Oh God, that actually gets into a problem because then you can get into the other person's

242
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:57,760
shit. Okay. You're going to need a biometric say for your stool and your reserve stool.

243
00:21:57,760 --> 00:22:04,640
Your orange is the new black poop and hold on. This goes down so deep. Why don't you just like

244
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:08,480
trust and love each other? I guess that's an easier option and you don't have to buy our dongle.

245
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:14,800
If the roles were reversed, um, Sydney could definitely Trump me by saying that, Oh, that's

246
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:22,160
okay. I'll just pick up wherever you're at. What are you serious? Oh, we would turn up when we first

247
00:22:22,160 --> 00:22:26,720
started dating, we would turn on shows and she would say, Oh yeah, I've seen some of the season.

248
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:33,840
What? What did you say? You watched some of them and then stopped and then started watching.

249
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:40,320
What are you even saying? I don't even understand. I read the first and middle chapters of that book.

250
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:44,240
Who does that? I mean, I did. If I was like cheating to get through my accelerator,

251
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:51,040
I read every other page of treasure Island. I'm just saying, if you don't sync up with your

252
00:22:51,040 --> 00:22:54,960
partner, when you're watching your favorite television shows, then you're being a real

253
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:59,600
goober boy. So I said it like that. So it'd be like an inside joke that like, maybe it would

254
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:03,280
seem like we've referenced that in past episodes of my brother, my brother and me. And so like,

255
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:06,240
people would think like, wait a minute, did you listen to that episode to their partner?

256
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:09,280
If they listened to my brother, my brother and me in that way, just to sort of like throw them

257
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:14,080
off as like a practical joke. But what about this part, Griffin? But you've just said that you just

258
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:18,880
explained why you did it. Well, I was hoping that one of the partners would be laughing so loud that

259
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:24,960
they can't hear this. Okay. The great goober boy joke. Well, it's a, it's a conceptual, but you didn't

260
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:28,960
before. It was an alternate reality. It was an alternate. It was an alternate. It was an

261
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:38,160
alternate reality game. Griffin. That was genius. Thank you. Griffin, Griffin, Griffin.

262
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:45,760
I'm honored to work with you. Happy Father's Day. You guys want another Yahoo?

263
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:53,120
Sure. Was that all the opening? Yeah. Let's get to our first question. This Yahoo was sent in by

264
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:57,840
Zoe Kinski climbing that ladder. Thank you Zoe Kinski. It's by Yahoo answers user VB who asks,

265
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:05,120
does anyone practice baby massage on their six, 12 month old baby? A friend of mine is

266
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:09,440
trained in baby massage and showed me how to do it on my little boy when he was about three months

267
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:13,840
old. He loved it, but I didn't really continue with it as much as I should have. Now he is eight

268
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:16,800
months old and he is having trouble with his teething and sleeping problems. So I thought

269
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:22,960
perhaps baby massage would help. Only problem is he is now so active. I can't get him to stay still

270
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:27,040
long enough. He gets frustrated if I try and keep him lying down. I don't really want to try and

271
00:24:27,040 --> 00:24:31,440
make him anyway. Is that defeats the purpose of baby massage as you are only supposed to do it

272
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:36,000
when they are relaxed. So I was just wondering if anyone on here has been more successful with their

273
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:43,200
LO and little one. Correct. And if you have any tips, thanks X. This is a Father's Day question

274
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:50,480
just for Justin about his baby massage techniques. Yeah, I, they're good for when the baby is trying

275
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:57,200
to get to sleep. It can be useful to, to, I found that that soothes her sometimes. Oops. Oops. This

276
00:24:57,200 --> 00:25:00,800
is supposed to be a joke. Is this baby massage a real thing? Well, yeah, massage is like a real

277
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:05,440
thing. Well, it's also important to use it after your baby's had a tough week at work. Maybe the

278
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:11,280
boss has been riding. So this, so okay. Baby massage is a real thing, but to Travis's point,

279
00:25:11,280 --> 00:25:18,880
I, the, the problem I had with baby massage is what am I, what, what, what stress is this,

280
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:27,200
what stress is this baby trying to unwind from? Like I saw your whole day, baby. You ate some

281
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:33,120
Cheetos and then fell asleep in the car and then watched cartoons forever and then went to sleep

282
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:39,200
at seven. Your life is fucking dope as hell. I would trade, I would Freaky Friday you in a

283
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:45,200
heartbeat. Why am I going to massage you? How about you get those little feet, get those little

284
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:49,440
puppies up on daddy's back and walk on dad's back and massage him cause dad's had a day. Thanks for

285
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:54,400
the rub down pops. Mom left the room, thought she existed no more. Yeah, that's the thing,

286
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:58,160
that object permanence Justin, that is the stressful thing. Can you imagine if every time

287
00:25:58,160 --> 00:26:02,400
Sydney left the room was like, well Sydney's not here anymore. Shit. You would get some tension

288
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:08,480
up in your sacrum and stuff. Sydney is not now nor ever was. No, whoops. Yeah, but then it's

289
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:14,000
counterbalanced by the fact that every, every like two minutes you got to be like, I have a mother.

290
00:26:17,040 --> 00:26:25,600
It's all balanced out. Oh man. That doesn't relax you. Run me through your baby massage techniques

291
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:32,400
are there aromatherapeutic elements? What do you ask her? You get the, you light a Barney scented

292
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:38,720
candle. What does that smell? What does Barney smell like? Like the sweaty inside of a sweaty

293
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:43,440
suit. It is very unpopular. I bet that I bet actually a baby would like that because for

294
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:47,760
like nine months a baby was like inside of a sweaty suit. That's what it's like to be in utero

295
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:53,280
inside of a Barney costume or any costume. I used to play cowabunga, the WTCR mascot of our daddy's

296
00:26:53,280 --> 00:26:58,080
radio station. So it was basically like I was having a, a rebirth experience every time that

297
00:26:58,080 --> 00:27:04,000
I was chili fest rolled around. Where is that? He should be here by now. I don't know. I don't know.

298
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:07,760
Oh, he just texted. He said he's running about 15 minutes late. If he's not in the room,

299
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:12,000
then I refuse to acknowledge his existence. The apps are going to get cold. I don't know.

300
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:17,920
Baby, you like squeeze their little hands and arms and like, is it just squeezing the baby back?

301
00:27:17,920 --> 00:27:21,280
What? It's just basically squeezing. That sounds like it's more for you than it is for her.

302
00:27:21,920 --> 00:27:25,760
I didn't really, I didn't really learn how to do it. I got as far as learning that it's a thing and

303
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:30,720
then just kind of went crazy. Well, I am of the school. It's not something you can learn. It's

304
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:36,000
something you either can do or you can't like, look at your hands. Look at that baby does one

305
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:40,960
and one make two. You know what I mean? Yeah, for sure. I like to, I like to take an Ashiatsu

306
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:47,440
approach. A lot of, uh, you mix in some, some, uh, oh, some cleansing yoga and then you, uh,

307
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:52,240
and this part's, oh man, be careful, but you got to stand on your baby and you're not going to want

308
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:56,400
to do it and the baby's not going to want to do it. And don't do cupping. A lot of people will

309
00:27:56,400 --> 00:28:01,760
say, cup the baby. Don't. No, you'll get, you'll suck the whole baby up into it. Charlie really

310
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:09,280
enjoys, uh, baby acupuncture. And that takes a steady hand, boy. And you have to pink the needles

311
00:28:09,280 --> 00:28:15,360
in some parts. Because, oh my goodness, there is not a lot of area on that baby that's expendable.

312
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:21,440
Especially if you're going in the ocular region, who, boy. I mean, the baby gets the,

313
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:24,880
well, they get tension headaches. Is there a difference between that and hot stone?

314
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:30,400
Hot stone? Oh no, for that I just leave the baby out on the sidewalk because I feel like

315
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:35,120
it's been, it's been sunny all day and that'll be, that'll be fun. And also daddy needs a drink and

316
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:40,960
a nap. Catch you in 15, little kid. I guess I prefer it when babies massage each other,

317
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:46,320
um, just sort of like in like a seductive way because it's like more pure and, um, like the

318
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:52,240
energy will be better. Mm-hmm. It's good to, um, it's good to do baby massage outside on the lawn,

319
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:57,360
but do not leave your baby unattended for too long or they will be carried away by ants.

320
00:28:57,360 --> 00:29:01,840
Yeah. That is a, that is a parenting tip from me to you. It would, it would blow your mind

321
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:06,240
how many babies get carried away by ants. Ants are very strong. Just one per year,

322
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:12,080
but then they get to be the ant king or queen. Uh, listen, acupuncture needles aren't gonna

323
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:16,640
buy themselves. So, uh, let's go to the money zone. Especially not these super little ones.

324
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:28,400
Yeah. With all the fun colors.

325
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:33,200
My brother, my brother and me is supported in part by Casper, an online retailer of premium,

326
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:38,640
obsessively engineered mattresses for a fraction of the price. Now I know it's weird what you're

327
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:43,600
thinking. Buy a mattress without sleeping on it. That's insane. So what Casper does is a risk-free

328
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:49,680
trial and return policy. You can try sleeping on one for a hundred days and you get free delivery

329
00:29:49,680 --> 00:29:53,680
and painless returns. That's a lot of farts you can put in that mattress. Travis. You can put a

330
00:29:53,680 --> 00:29:57,840
lot of farts in that mattress. Justin. You can fill that mattress with farts and send it back.

331
00:29:57,840 --> 00:30:01,680
You would double the weight of that mattress before you send it back. Travis. If you listen

332
00:30:01,680 --> 00:30:06,400
our show, you can get $50 towards any mattress purchase if you go to Casper.com slash my brother

333
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:10,800
and then use the coupon code, my brother, all one word at checkout. Terms and conditions do apply.

334
00:30:10,800 --> 00:30:15,840
Travis, you, uh, you have been sleeping on a Casper. Uh, how's that working out for you?

335
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:22,160
Um, it was interesting at first because I prefer a bit of a softer mattress and Teresa prefers a

336
00:30:22,160 --> 00:30:29,600
firmer mattress. And this is such an interesting balance of those two that now it's been about a

337
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:34,320
month, I would say, since we started sleeping on it. I can't imagine sleeping on anything else.

338
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:39,920
It's it's because it's memory foam. It's very soft, but because of the engineering of it,

339
00:30:39,920 --> 00:30:44,160
it's also a very firm. So it's like a very firm memory foam. I highly recommend it.

340
00:30:44,160 --> 00:30:48,400
Um, been getting a lot of good sleeps. It says here that these mattresses are obsessively

341
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:52,560
engineered. That's not just a, like a bullet point that literally you are guaranteed that

342
00:30:52,560 --> 00:30:57,440
an engineer went mad with every mattress that they create. Every mattress they get,

343
00:30:57,440 --> 00:31:01,920
they, they basically burn out an engineer's mind and, and they succumb to the darkness.

344
00:31:01,920 --> 00:31:05,920
Now, one out of every hundred mattresses is haunted by that engineer.

345
00:31:05,920 --> 00:31:09,280
Oh, and you got to be careful with that one. What do you think they call it? Casper? What

346
00:31:09,280 --> 00:31:16,960
do you think the next thing is like the next sponsor? Oh yeah. Next sponsor is a slip shine.

Oh, and saving lives. We're so proud of you. You're a pal and a confidant and we rely on each

364
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:18,320
other. Oh, is that the golden girls theme song? No, that's islands in the stream. I got those two

365
00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:22,560
confused. Didn't I? You did. You did get those two confused. Both great tunes. Let me get on the ones

366
00:33:22,560 --> 00:33:26,320
and twos real quick. And cause now I've got the inspiration and if I don't do it now, I'll forget

367
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:32,400
about it. Here comes the birthday mashup. Kate from us to you. My name is Ez. This is my new

368
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:36,080
band. I'm putting together a new musical artists. I'm calling myself golden girl talk.

369
00:33:36,800 --> 00:33:42,560
Um, that was a great joke and it was pearls before swine. I leave that for the audience.

370
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:50,240
I, uh, the only song that Charlie likes is all about that base. The only song that Charlie

371
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:54,880
liked. It used to be that and smoke weed every day. Uh, but now it's just all about that base.

372
00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:59,760
I've listened to that fucking song so many times that I've started inadvertently creating mashups

373
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:03,920
in my head between that and other songs that I like more than all about that base, which is to

374
00:34:03,920 --> 00:34:10,160
say basically any of them at this point. So I will often walk down my house singing to myself. Let me

375
00:34:10,160 --> 00:34:17,280
see if I can do it. All about that base, about that base. No trouble. You'd like to think that

376
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:22,320
you're immune to this stuff. Oh my God, that's fresh. It's a really good, it's a really good

377
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:26,560
mix. If somebody could like edit that and make it into like a mix I can listen to, maybe my baby

378
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:33,600
will like that. I can transition her gradually to any other song by mixing up with, uh, all about

379
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:38,320
that base. I don't know. I got a message for Crystal from Daniel. Uh, Jumbotron, Jumbotron,

I did appreciate how you tried to make that last sentence rhyme. I also really like it had more of

389
00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:33,040
like a slam poem. Yeah, I was kind of hoping you would slam it even harder than you slammed it. Like

390

I want like a monster dump. Man, this, this rhyming stuff is easy. Happy birthday, Crystal. I hope

table. Yeah, I thought we had those installed before, and I didn't think there were, I didn't

407
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:10,880
think there were microphones. I thought they were bottles of A1 sauce. We just had our microphones

408
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:16,400
painted to look like bottles of A1 sauce because it helps us focus our recording. How about we

409
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:20,800
could make you a podcast celebrity? If you let us keep sitting here waiting for our daddy,

410
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:26,400
we'll let you read a question on our podcast. I'm interested in fame. I get more than enough

411
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:31,040
fame working here at the Applebee's on 16th and Lexington. People know my name. I have a

412
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:35,840
distinctive voice. I'm very memorable. My name is Sheila, and I'm the Applebee's manager. If you

413
00:37:35,840 --> 00:37:43,040
work at an Applebee's, statistically speaking, you probably will at some point be the subject of a

414
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:50,960
snarky opinion column on a food blog at some point. For sure. I run my own food blog. What's it called?

415
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:57,440
It's called Five People You Meet in Heaven. Listen, you guys can take it. You seem like a good bunch.

416
00:37:57,440 --> 00:38:01,120
I'm gonna, I'm gonna let you, I'm gonna get out of here. I just, can I take a drink order? Can I

417
00:38:01,120 --> 00:38:07,200
do anything for you? I ordered a jalapeno mudslide that still hasn't come yet. I will check into

418
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:15,280
that, sir. I'm just, I'm grossly sorry. I will also take two brutuses. Do you want those all in

419
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:21,360
same glass or do you just want me to pour them in some sort of gravy boat? Same glass is fine. Terrific. I'm

420
00:38:21,360 --> 00:38:27,120
gonna get that gravy boat too on the free, on the free cheese. I get arrested all the time.

421
00:38:27,120 --> 00:38:31,120
Is that one of the collectible ones with the Star Trek characters on it? Yeah, it's one of the Star

422
00:38:31,120 --> 00:38:34,640
Trek gravy boats. I'll see y'all later. Hey, I'll talk to you guys. See you tomorrow.

423
00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:43,520
I already missed Sheila. Yeah, me too. I missed the first guy,

424
00:38:43,520 --> 00:38:49,600
but I couldn't remember what his voice sounded like. I'm sorry, Trav. Go ahead. I get interrupted all

425
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:53,520
the time. No, you know what? I don't, I don't want to break the tradition. Whether I'm telling a

426
00:38:53,520 --> 00:38:57,360
long-winded story or just trying to finish a sentence, it seems like people have no problem

427
00:38:57,360 --> 00:39:03,520
with just talking over me before I've made my point. It's really starting to bug me,

428
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:09,520
but I don't know. I don't know how to tell people to pipe down. This is going to be impossible to

429
00:39:09,520 --> 00:39:14,720
edit. Don't edit. Why would you edit this? This has all been gold. Let me finish without coming

430
00:39:14,720 --> 00:39:18,160
off like a jerk. How do I get my friends to STFU for like a second without sounding like a complete

431
00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:25,680
dick constantly cut off in Colorado? What I, the way I did deal with this when I did Children's

432
00:39:25,680 --> 00:39:33,440
Theater is I would stop mid-sentence and just stop. Just stop my thought. Stop it. Just let

433
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:37,680
the awkwardness hang there. And if they don't want to come back to me, that's fine. That's

434
00:39:37,680 --> 00:39:42,080
their prerogative. It probably wasn't that important anyway. I can also say as someone who

435
00:39:42,080 --> 00:39:49,200
interrupts people a lot, the best defense against getting interrupted is to keep the energy you are

436
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:53,600
using, the conversational energy you are using up. Because a lot of the time when I interrupt people,

437
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:59,680
it's because you're trying to save them. What? They're bombing. Well, yeah, I feel like they're,

438
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:04,160
so it's something you deal with like in acting, especially in Shakespeare, not going down at the

439
00:40:04,160 --> 00:40:09,280
end of lines because people will tend to like drop their energy as they get to the end of a thought.

440
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:14,720
So you're suggesting that when you or anybody else interrupts a person, it's because they

441
00:40:14,720 --> 00:40:20,720
weren't being hype enough. It's their fault. Well, no, it's because they felt like I think they run

442
00:40:20,720 --> 00:40:26,560
out of things to say, but they won't let themselves stop talking. I'm doing them a favor by interrupting.

443
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:35,200
That is a demented way to think about things. It just seems like. I mean, yeah, I'm not saying it's

444
00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:39,360
like a healthy mindset. I'm just saying that that is the idea of like, I want to keep the ball in

445
00:40:39,360 --> 00:40:44,320
the air and it feels like their energy is flagging. So I'm going to take over for them and then they

446
00:40:44,320 --> 00:40:49,200
can jump back in. Why not just say that then? Instead of hopping in and seeming rude, why

447
00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:52,560
don't you let them know that you're doing them a favor and be like, hold on, hold on, hold on.

448
00:40:52,560 --> 00:40:56,960
Let me step in here because you take a break. Go, go take a drink of water. Your mouth sounds very

449
00:40:56,960 --> 00:41:02,400
dry. Have you confronted these people? Like literally just said like, hey, I don't know

450
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:07,040
if you realize you're doing it, but you interrupt me a lot. What if they can't even get that out,

451
00:41:07,040 --> 00:41:13,760
though? Are they are they invisible? Are they a ghost person? Like maybe just wait a minute.

452
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:24,160
Are you a ghost? Oh, shit. Have you been a ghost this whole time? The earbuds fall out of his ears

453
00:41:24,160 --> 00:41:28,320
and roll across the floor. He pictures all the red things he's come in contact with over the

454
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:36,400
last 16 years. He looks in a mirror. It's the first time he's looked at a mirror ever. I think

455
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:40,880
a ghost would be able to see themselves. I don't know the rule on. Is it a ghost mirror? That's a

456
00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:45,360
good question. Travis didn't even think about that. The mirror must be haunted. That's my

457
00:41:46,320 --> 00:41:50,800
favorite Barbara Streisand movie. The mirror must be haunted. Can we talk about what?

458
00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:57,840
If he can only interact with red objects. Is that some sort of ghost lore that I don't know about?

459
00:41:57,840 --> 00:42:01,120
Like ghosts love cherry lifesavers. They're the only ones that can eat and taste and they're

460
00:42:01,120 --> 00:42:06,880
delicious. No, Griffin. Those are the road flags planted that every time it was a ghost moment,

461
00:42:06,880 --> 00:42:12,400
that there was something red there. Not that his power was only to interact with red things.

462
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:15,600
That's the dumbest thing I've ever heard. Was that for us, the viewers? I'm getting angry. Do

463
00:42:15,600 --> 00:42:20,480
you guys want a Yahoo? Sure. This one's for dads out there in the audience. If you're a dad,

464
00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:25,920
listen. Congratulations. It's sent in by Zoe Kinski climbing that ladder. Thank you, Zoe. It's by

465
00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:33,120
Yahoo Answers user unknown who asks, how to make my dad stop using words like swag. He is ruining

466
00:42:33,120 --> 00:42:42,560
my life. I am 16 and my dad is 40 something. Learn your dad's age. Everybody learn your dad.

467
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:45,680
I can't tell you how many people I talked to. You're like, how old is your dad? And I don't

468
00:42:45,680 --> 00:42:50,240
know. I don't know. 50 something. I can't tell you how many times I've listened to Griffin ask

469
00:42:50,240 --> 00:42:54,720
people how old their dads are. And that's what I want to intercede on his behalf. Well, yeah.

470
00:42:54,720 --> 00:43:00,240
Cause it's a competition. The oldest dad or youngest dad or tightest dad bod or which dad

471
00:43:00,240 --> 00:43:04,640
traveled the farthest to get here today. Yeah. Yeah. Most likely to succeed. My dad has the

472
00:43:04,640 --> 00:43:13,680
prettiest eyes. Class clown. Did not succeed is another one. Biggest failure. Anyway, my dad is

473
00:43:13,680 --> 00:43:18,400
40 something and IDK if his having a midlife crisis or something, but he keeps using words

474
00:43:18,400 --> 00:43:25,760
like swag, YOLO. And then there's some like at sign hash pound percent at like maybe they're

475
00:43:25,760 --> 00:43:32,880
cursing or maybe this dad is just like yelling YOLO and then using profanity. Um, bro chilling

476
00:43:32,880 --> 00:43:40,160
with my bros dudes sup and then in words, but that's not, that's different. That's a whole

477
00:43:40,160 --> 00:43:47,440
another can of worms. Um, it's a whole other dad per se. Yeah. Uh, that's not that exclusive.

478
00:43:47,440 --> 00:43:52,880
That's a just bad, uh, et cetera. I think you get what I mean. And it's so annoying because he's

479
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:56,320
trying to act all cool and stuff, but it's just so weird. For example, yesterday my friends were

480
00:43:56,320 --> 00:44:00,800
here and we were playing this video game my friend brought and he walks in all like sup bros,

481
00:44:00,800 --> 00:44:07,360
are you chilling? You want some beer? And then he attempted to high five my friends. Oh God.

482
00:44:07,360 --> 00:44:11,200
And he took a look at the game and he was like sick game. You've got dude

483
00:44:13,760 --> 00:44:18,080
update. I actually did ask him to just stop because he's making a fool out of himself.

484
00:44:18,080 --> 00:44:23,440
And you know what he said? He literally said blank, please. I'm guessing that is another

485
00:44:23,440 --> 00:44:28,560
racial slur, racial charge word and left. It's getting out of control. I know this might sound

486
00:44:28,560 --> 00:44:33,120
fake, but he's like that. That's why I'm here. Update number two. Ooh, long narrative on this

487
00:44:33,120 --> 00:44:38,400
one. Dad and I have come to an understanding. I didn't appreciate him. He didn't appreciate me.

488
00:44:38,400 --> 00:44:43,440
We've grown closer as friends. No, instead a update to the copy of updates who reads

489
00:44:43,440 --> 00:44:52,960
he said inward please and we are not even black. Seriously. This question asked by Timmy Hawk.

490
00:44:54,320 --> 00:44:58,400
No, Tony Hawk is a perfectly just and I interviewed Tony Hawk for our job

491
00:44:58,400 --> 00:45:02,880
and he's a perfectly lovely man. Also, Tony Hawk's son is not Timmy. I brought this up because there

492
00:45:02,880 --> 00:45:07,440
was a commercial that popped on Hulu the other day of like Tony Hawk, like had his kid, like he's

493
00:45:07,440 --> 00:45:11,120
driving a car, his kids are in the back seat and they're all like boarding on their phones and

494
00:45:11,120 --> 00:45:16,880
stuff and he like peels off the road and drives to like an abandoned water park and they like all

495
00:45:16,880 --> 00:45:22,240
skateboard around the park. Hell yes. I was left with this genuine feeling of I bet he's an awesome

496
00:45:22,240 --> 00:45:27,760
dad. Oh, he's the best dad in the world. Yeah, the only problem is he named his first child 360 bones.

497
00:45:30,560 --> 00:45:37,600
And then the second one, Ollie. And it's like, okay, that's better. But then his second son was

498
00:45:37,600 --> 00:45:42,800
born without bones and I bet he was like, oh, if only I'd waited. And he named his third son

499
00:45:42,800 --> 00:45:50,080
Harry Potter. That's just what he was into. And then his fourth son he named Giant Flaming. So

500
00:45:50,080 --> 00:45:56,400
his name would be Giant Flaming Hawk, which is a pretty sweet name. It's my son Thunder Hawk.

501
00:45:56,400 --> 00:46:00,160
How do you make my dad stop using these words? These terrible, terrible words. A lot of these

502
00:46:00,160 --> 00:46:03,360
words I think are fine for your dad to use and I'm kind of excited about them. Obviously

503
00:46:03,360 --> 00:46:11,200
not the racially charged ones. It depends on how he how he's. Let's take the racially charged words

504
00:46:11,200 --> 00:46:16,800
out of the conversation because that's a whole nother can of worms. Yeah, you have to be a

505
00:46:16,800 --> 00:46:21,760
pretty cool dad to pull those off. Am I right, guys? Yeah. But if he's if he's coming in with

506
00:46:21,760 --> 00:46:26,080
like swag and yellow, is he saying like this? Yeah. What up, bros? Or is he coming and going,

507
00:46:26,080 --> 00:46:37,360
yo, what up bros? Huh? Yolo? Who here is a cool homie who wants to swig some of my beer, Yolo?

508
00:46:38,480 --> 00:46:44,320
I'm going to a group hang with my other swag dads. Swag dads would be an awesome bowling

509
00:46:44,320 --> 00:46:49,920
league name. Hashtag swag dads. Hashtag swag dads. It's just a chill hang at the Sitco.

510
00:46:49,920 --> 00:46:58,240
I'm going to meet some other dads at the DMV. Gonna get our car registration on. Yeah,

511
00:46:58,960 --> 00:47:03,760
you know we gotta get that state approved identification. I'm gonna go because they

512
00:47:03,760 --> 00:47:11,520
revoked our license for drunk driving. Hashtag swag dads. We got all silly with some four loco

513
00:47:11,520 --> 00:47:21,520
and then we got in my Jeep Grand Cherokee. Steve died. Damn, I'm gonna go meet my other gearhead

514
00:47:21,520 --> 00:47:25,600
dads and we're gonna go get our rides checked to get them inspected, which is something you have to

515
00:47:25,600 --> 00:47:31,600
do once a year just so you know for the future. You have that to look forward to, Yolo. Hey,

516
00:47:31,600 --> 00:47:38,240
kids, Rolos. It's not the thing. I just, does anybody want any delicious Rolos candy? Maybe

517
00:47:38,240 --> 00:47:42,960
I'll get a sweet new Hummer with some neon on the bottom. Just kidding. With these gas prices,

518
00:47:42,960 --> 00:47:47,920
I think I'm gonna go with sort of a midsize sedan. But anybody wants some of this purple

519
00:47:47,920 --> 00:47:58,400
drink? By which I mean grape, clearly Canadian. Which is clear. By the way, I put some purple

520
00:47:58,400 --> 00:48:06,160
food coloring in it. Yolo. I'm getting down on some caesarip. By which I mean, I'm robo tripping,

521
00:48:06,160 --> 00:48:11,600
I meant. Because I have a head cold and so I do. I'm gonna hit the sack early. Night, you guys.

522
00:48:11,600 --> 00:48:15,600
Don't stay up too late. Don't wake up your mother. I love you. I love you all so much.

523
00:48:15,600 --> 00:48:21,440
I love all of you. I know that Bryce is my only one of you who's a son, but I feel like we're

524
00:48:21,440 --> 00:48:26,240
connected with you guys. You all have so much potential. I feel like I just don't want to see

525
00:48:26,240 --> 00:48:31,280
you waste it. I'm proud of all of you. I know for a while you guys have just thought of me as Bryce's

526
00:48:31,280 --> 00:48:36,800
dad, but it would actually help me out a lot. And I think it would help us build a stronger relationship

527
00:48:36,800 --> 00:48:40,800
if you would think of me as your 420 Yolo swag. Do you guys like-

528
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:44,160
Hey, don't stay up too late. Do you guys like Drake?

529
00:48:44,160 --> 00:48:48,400
Hey, you guys remember when I burned those pizza rolls a while ago and everybody was really upset

530
00:48:48,400 --> 00:48:51,440
and we didn't have any more? I feel like we came out of that with a real like,

531
00:48:51,440 --> 00:48:56,240
standby me vibe. Like a real brotherhood, like just really connected. Like we're never gonna

532
00:48:56,240 --> 00:49:01,200
forget it. Do you guys get the same sense or is that just- okay. Please don't wake up your mother.

533
00:49:01,200 --> 00:49:03,040
Please don't wake up your mother. It's final.

534
00:49:03,040 --> 00:49:07,120
And don't come into my bedroom later because I'm gonna be crushing some guts up there.

535
00:49:08,640 --> 00:49:10,080
I love you all so much.

536
00:49:10,080 --> 00:49:14,240
I love you all so much. Some of you more than Bryce.

537
00:49:15,360 --> 00:49:18,320
And also, I was just kidding about that. We're probably gonna hit that hair early.

538
00:49:19,520 --> 00:49:23,920
Bryce's mom and I haven't touched each other in years. Okay. Good night, everybody. Yolo.

539
00:49:23,920 --> 00:49:28,960
We're gonna go up there and finish True Detective for a season and then we're gonna hit the hair.

540
00:49:28,960 --> 00:49:32,400
Now that I've got you kids here though, I do want to talk to you about crushing guts

541
00:49:32,400 --> 00:49:39,120
because it's important that you do it responsibly in a place where you feel safe. I know for you

542
00:49:39,120 --> 00:49:44,640
guys, you think you know all there is to know about crushing guts and busting nuts, but there's

543
00:49:44,640 --> 00:49:50,400
a lot more to it than that. There's a lot more to it than that. It's a promise. When you crush a gut,

544
00:49:50,400 --> 00:49:51,760
it's a promise you're making.

545
00:49:51,760 --> 00:49:55,040
You know what's really cool, guys? Safe sex.

546
00:49:56,160 --> 00:50:00,400
Safe sex. If you're gonna bust a nut, make sure you put a Jimmy cap on your dunger.

547
00:50:00,400 --> 00:50:00,720
Yeah.

548
00:50:00,720 --> 00:50:01,920
All right. We've lost a bit.

549
00:50:01,920 --> 00:50:03,040
Okay. Good night, everybody.

550
00:50:03,040 --> 00:50:04,000
Good night, everyone.

551
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:07,760
Hey, listen. Please, please don't wake up your mother.

552
00:50:07,760 --> 00:50:08,560
Oh my gosh.

553
00:50:08,560 --> 00:50:10,640
Don't tell her I talked to you guys about this. Yolo.

554
00:50:11,840 --> 00:50:14,720
Don't tell her I talked out loud without her permission. You know how she gets.

555
00:50:15,520 --> 00:50:18,000
Please be out of here before she wakes up if she finds you guys here.

556
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:18,880
Please be gone.

557
00:50:18,880 --> 00:50:20,480
I'm not allowed to have friends over.

558
00:50:20,480 --> 00:50:26,240
What if your dad talked a bunch of shit like this, and then Dakota crossed you, and he's like,

559
00:50:26,240 --> 00:50:30,080
I'm gonna go get loked on Dakota's dad, and he went out and just blew Dakota's dad away.

560
00:50:31,120 --> 00:50:36,640
Just like, full drive-by, like, holy shit, dad. He's like, I know. I've been trying to tell you

561
00:50:36,640 --> 00:50:40,400
guys I'm gangster as hell. You shouldn't have tried to-

562
00:50:40,400 --> 00:50:44,320
I was supposed to go be a deacon at the church tonight, but I'm gonna take a break to go kill

563
00:50:44,320 --> 00:50:45,680
Dakota's dad.

564
00:50:45,680 --> 00:50:50,480
I call my boy Nate Dog. I call my boy Nate Dog's dad, and we had to go regulate.

565
00:50:50,480 --> 00:50:55,520
Nate Dog's dad would be 88 years old at this point. Are we regulating?

566
00:50:58,720 --> 00:51:01,520
I'm gonna need someone to roll me out.

567
00:51:01,520 --> 00:51:04,880
Hey, thanks so much for listening to our podcast, my brother, my brother, and me.

568
00:51:04,880 --> 00:51:08,960
We hope you've had a lot of fun. Listen, if you're in the Seattle or Vancouver area,

569
00:51:08,960 --> 00:51:13,840
or you can get there, we're gonna be doing a live show there at the end of August.

570
00:51:13,840 --> 00:51:21,760
Bit.ly forward slash mbnbamseattle, bit.ly forward slash van mbnbam.

571
00:51:21,760 --> 00:51:27,360
Those tickets are going quickly, so please buy some tickets. It's reserved seating, so the

572
00:51:27,360 --> 00:51:32,080
longer you wait, the worse your seats will be, so make sure you go right now and go buy some

573
00:51:32,080 --> 00:51:35,280
tickets to those shows. Buy tickets to all the shows, and then just come to all of them.

574
00:51:35,280 --> 00:51:37,600
We're gonna drive to all of them. Why can't you?

575
00:51:38,240 --> 00:51:40,240
Well, they can't buy ones to the Portland ones.

576
00:51:40,240 --> 00:51:45,360
Don't buy ones to the Portland shows. It's sold out, but the other ones do it.

577
00:51:45,360 --> 00:51:46,560
Yeah, why not?

578
00:51:46,560 --> 00:51:51,840
It's different stuff. Jeff, at least 60% different jokes every night. I can guarantee you that.

579
00:51:51,840 --> 00:51:55,200
The stunts will be the same, and the games, those are mostly gonna be the same.

580
00:51:55,920 --> 00:52:01,760
If you haven't yet, we really appreciate it if you would go to iTunes and subscribe,

581
00:52:01,760 --> 00:52:07,600
rate, review, help bump us up them old iTunes charts. It makes us feel good and makes you

582
00:52:07,600 --> 00:52:11,360
look awesome. I don't know how, but it does.

583
00:52:11,360 --> 00:52:14,160
All right, excuse me, are you reviewing a podcast on iTunes?

584
00:52:14,720 --> 00:52:16,640
You seem like one slag dad.

585
00:52:16,640 --> 00:52:18,640
Do you mind if I crush your guts?

586
00:52:20,720 --> 00:52:23,680
Thank you so much to John Roderick and the Long Winters for the use of our theme song

587
00:52:23,680 --> 00:52:26,560
instead of Parchu off the album, Putting the Days to Bed. We got to kick it

588
00:52:26,560 --> 00:52:30,320
with John Roderick at Max Funcon. By the way, thank you to everybody who came to Max Funcon.

589
00:52:30,320 --> 00:52:35,440
That was a hell of a fun weekend. We had a good time chatting with John about his Seattle

590
00:52:35,440 --> 00:52:41,760
City Council campaign. If you live in the city of Seattle, look him up. Look up his platform.

591
00:52:41,760 --> 00:52:43,600
He's got some real good ideas.

592
00:52:44,800 --> 00:52:49,360
And just go vote in the primary. The primary's coming up. It's like August 1st, I think.

593
00:52:49,360 --> 00:52:50,800
Yeah, so go do that.

594
00:52:51,840 --> 00:52:55,680
He's a super sweet dude. Thank you, John Roderick. Go listen to the other shows on the Max Funcon

595
00:52:55,680 --> 00:53:00,160
network, too. We have other shows that we do, like The Adventure Zone, which is a D&D podcast

596
00:53:00,160 --> 00:53:04,320
that the three of us do with our dad. It's a super fun show. If you don't know anything

597
00:53:04,320 --> 00:53:10,080
about D&D, we don't either, so it's a pretty good barrier or a low barrier of entry, I guess.

598
00:53:10,080 --> 00:53:13,680
But then we got Justin Has Sawbones, which he does with his wife, Sydney, about medical

599
00:53:13,680 --> 00:53:17,520
history. Travis has Bunker Buddies that he does with his friend, Andy, about different

600
00:53:17,520 --> 00:53:24,560
apocalypses. And then there's a bunch of other shows on the Max Funcon network, like Throwing

601
00:53:24,560 --> 00:53:29,360
Shade and Lady 2 Lady and International Waters, which is hilarious. We saw a live taping of that

602
00:53:29,360 --> 00:53:33,200
at Max Funcon, too. There's so many good shows. They're all free. Go to maxfuncon.org and check

603
00:53:33,200 --> 00:53:39,120
them all out. I also do a podcast with my best friend, Brent. You may know him as Brentalfloss.

604
00:53:39,120 --> 00:53:41,920
We do a show called Trends Like These, where we talk about what's trending on the internet. It

605
00:53:41,920 --> 00:53:47,680
comes out every Monday and Thursday. And Justin, I'm so glad you guys are back, right?

606
00:53:49,200 --> 00:53:54,160
Should be this week, yes. I cannot wait. New episodes of Things I Bought at Sheets. They

607
00:53:54,160 --> 00:53:59,040
went on hiatus for a while while they explored different artistic endeavors, but they're coming

608
00:53:59,040 --> 00:54:05,200
back. So excited. Things I Bought at Sheets with the Z. Go check it out on YouTube. Also,

609
00:54:05,200 --> 00:54:08,560
I've been getting way into Periscope. People should follow me on Periscope. Having a lot of

610
00:54:08,560 --> 00:54:15,520
fun. A lot of fun on Periscope. If you are anywhere near Charleston, West Virginia,

611
00:54:16,720 --> 00:54:25,840
our friend and confidant, John Hodgman, is going to be doing a show in Charleston. If you go to

612
00:54:25,840 --> 00:54:31,200
bit.ly. And this is today. If you're listening this Monday, the 22nd, he's doing it today.

613
00:54:31,200 --> 00:54:38,000
Go to bit.ly forward slash Hodgman WV, and you can get tickets to see Hodgman. They're 30 bucks,

614
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:42,160
and it's going to be great. I'll be there. Come say hi to both of us, and it's going to be a hoot.

615
00:54:42,160 --> 00:54:47,600
Bit.ly forward slash Hodgman WV. Do you guys want that final?

616
00:54:47,600 --> 00:54:52,640
Yeah. We hit you with it. It was sent in by Zoe Kinski. Oh, scaling that ladder. So close to the

617
00:54:52,640 --> 00:54:57,280
top. She'll get there. It's going to happen. Thank you, Zoe. It's by Yahoo Answers user,

618
00:54:58,240 --> 00:55:04,160
Danny, who asks, an anime that will make my dad cry?

619
00:55:06,640 --> 00:55:11,040
I'm Justin McElroy. I'm Travis McElroy. I'm Griffin McElroy. This has been my brother,

620
00:55:11,040 --> 00:55:23,520
and my brother may kiss your dad square on the lips.

621
00:55:41,280 --> 00:55:46,480
I'm Dan McCoy. I'm Stuart Wellington. And I'm Elliot Kalin. What is The Flophouse,

622
00:55:46,480 --> 00:55:50,160
you may very well ask? We watch a bad movie, and then we talk about it.

623
00:55:50,160 --> 00:55:54,000
A bad movie podcast? Isn't that like every fifth podcast on the internet?

624
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:57,680
I'd answer that by saying, one, we've been doing this show for over seven years,

625
00:55:57,680 --> 00:56:03,520
long before the entire premise of our show was a cliche, and two, shut up. Sick burn.

626
00:56:03,520 --> 00:56:08,640
I'd say that our show is more of a comedy podcast, a podcast about words that sound like other words,

627
00:56:08,640 --> 00:56:13,280
a podcast about me singing long, irritating songs like this one,

628
00:56:13,280 --> 00:56:18,480
a podcast about pitches for a Ziggy comic book movie or discussions about sex tarps.

629
00:56:18,480 --> 00:56:22,000
Yeah, I mean, mostly it's a show about three friends just hanging out

630
00:56:22,560 --> 00:56:25,120
and talking about ding dongs. That's mostly used to.

631
00:56:25,120 --> 00:56:27,760
Wait, what? So if you like any of those things,

632
00:56:27,760 --> 00:56:33,760
subscribe in iTunes today or visit MaximumFun.org to follow the show.

633
00:56:33,760 --> 00:56:39,760
The Flophouse.
