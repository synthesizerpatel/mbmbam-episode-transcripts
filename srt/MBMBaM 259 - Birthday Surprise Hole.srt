1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:30,800
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:45,360
It's a new craze, and good girls do you wanna? Just say, hey I wanna. Just say, hey I wanna.

6
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:48,080
Hey everybody, welcome to My Brother and Me, an invite show for the modern era. I'm

7
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:51,280
your oldest brother Justin McElroy. I'm your middle-est brother Travis McElroy.

8
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:56,480
It's me, the sweet baby brother, Griffin McElroy. I am so sorry that I was late

9
00:00:56,480 --> 00:01:01,120
recording the podcast. Like 20 minutes late. 40 minutes combined between me and Travis.

10
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:04,640
Yeah, wasted. That's 40 minutes of our life we won't get back. What could we have done with

11
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:10,400
that 40 minutes? Knowing you, you were probably like watching old episodes of Sister Sister on

12
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:14,800
Hulu or something. I'll have you know I was eating cold fried chicken over my kitchen sink like a

13
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:24,000
monster. And I was watching old episodes of Sister Sister on HBO Go. I was taking a cold shower.

14
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:29,840
Uh, that's my new thing. If you haven't tried it, I would highly recommend it. Very bracing,

15
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:34,720
very good for the heart, the creativity. I do that as well. It's also very good for

16
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:38,560
your skin and for your smell. When do you start that Trav? Uh, I started about uh,

17
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:44,160
about eight months ago. Yeah, do you only take cold showers? Well what I do is I start off warm

18
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:48,880
and then turn the temperature down. Ah, you do that James Bond shower. Do that James Bond

19
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:52,720
shower. That's correct Griffin. Are you trying to get rid of some hard-ons? You two just got chronic

20
00:01:52,720 --> 00:02:00,880
hard-ons for China squash? I do, but it's not connected. It's actually, I think an old wives

21
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:07,600
tale that taking the cold shower increases one's sexual potency. No, it can't and it won't. It

22
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:13,680
gives you better boners because it freezes them in place. And it freezes the blood in there?

23
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:20,080
It freezes the blood in your boner-sickle. This is the worst introduction we've ever done.

24
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:24,960
Because we're just talking about frozen boners. This was your idea Griffin. You were curious

25
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:29,360
about the cold shower lifestyle that Travis and I are living. And I'm here to tell you,

26
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:35,280
almost every day you switch it to cold. I get in it like lukewarm and then I just go full cold

27
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:40,800
shower the whole time. Uh, it feels, at first it feels like you're gonna die. I'm dying. But then

28
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:46,960
it's like I'm alive. You come through a hole. You live in that pain. You just exist in it. And then

29
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:53,600
you can't feel it anymore. Um, but how do the ghosts talk to you? Sorry, what? How do you,

30
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:58,960
oh sorry, not talk, but how do the ghosts get messages to you? Oh, without the steamy mirror.

31
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:02,720
I got you. The mirror gets steamy from the hot shower and then the ghost is like,

32
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:09,200
hey Griffin, have a good day. Love your grandpa. Love your, sorry, it's not denoting who it's from.

33
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:12,480
Love your grandpa. It's like, by the way, we're out of salsa. Can you pick some up?

34
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:18,080
Love your wife, Rachel. I want you to do two things for me today. I need you to run to HEB.

35
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:22,080
I need you to get some salsa, preferably of the mild variety. And also go love your grandpa.

36
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:32,240
Boo, it's me, your wife. I can't believe your wife was grandpa ghost catfishing you the whole time.

37
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:39,600
You misunderstand. She just wants me to love my grandpa. Okay. And also to go get some salsa

38
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:44,400
because we are plum out. Are you completely out or do you have like the dregs at the bottom,

39
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:49,280
but nobody really wants the dregs because there's like one tomato chunk in there.

40
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:52,400
No, it's not. I'm not worried about the tomato chunks. I'm worried about the

41
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:58,560
Tostito residuals. There's one sad chip in there that's just been marooned from his flock.

42
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:04,160
Here's the other thing about salsa. Yeah. But seriously, I do want to say one other thing

43
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:12,000
about salsa. Don't you guys hate it when you see a jar of flavored salsa, like some sort of exotic

44
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:17,600
salsa, like maybe a mango habanero salsa and you think, oh my God, that's going to be great.

45
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:22,080
And you eat it and you're like, well, that was good. But now I've condemned myself to this salsa

46
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:27,440
for, you just want, your buds want just like normal salsa. That's only a party salsa, Justin,

47
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:31,680
because you're basically tasking your group of friends to take on the beast with you.

48
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:38,640
Yeah. I don't want to go this alone. Yeah, sure. It's a Sunday, you just got out of church and

49
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:43,600
you're just looking for a sensible dip. And all that you've got is a sweet salsa. And that's

50
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:49,120
on Saturday night and it's party time. That's what you want. Let me hit you guys with this.

51
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:52,960
As long as we're talking about salsa, one last sort of salsa avenue I want to take us down.

52
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:58,960
Hop in your row boats through the lovely avenues of Salsa Venice, where the alleyways are just

53
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:04,800
salsa, salsa Greeks. And we're going to go on this salsa trip together. How about this salsa idea

54
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:10,480
that I've just come up with? Individual salsa packets, like ketchup packets, but it's just a

55
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:14,160
little bit of salsa in there. And then you can have whatever kind of fun flavors you want in there.

56
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:19,520
Are you talking like a little ramekin size or just like literally like a little pouch?

57
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:24,480
A little pouch. I think they have those. They're at Taco Bell and you can take as many as you want.

58
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:28,720
Oh, that's salsa in there, idiot? Well, I mean, it's more like taco sauce.

59
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:30,960
Yeah, it's more like taco sauce. That's a totally different thing.

60
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:34,400
I'm drinking a tall glass of salsa right here. I mean, it's actually more like water.

61
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:38,880
You can't just call things salsa. You can't just call things other things.

62
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:45,200
This is an original idea. You've made me so upset and we haven't even started the show.

63
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:50,400
I used to think that the thing about, you always think fresh salsa, you're going to make it homemade,

64
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:54,160
right? You're going to put it in the bullet. I have never thought this. I've never thought

65
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:59,600
that once in my adult life. You're going to think it's going to be so good, get it homemade, and then you just make salsa at home.

66
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:04,560
It just tastes like garbage. It's like a slurry of shitty vegetables and like,

67
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:08,240
oh, this is from my garden. Really? Because it tastes like trash. It's almost like there

68
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:13,520
should be a professional version of it you could pay money for that somebody who knows better than

69
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:20,160
you made. Yeah. I recreate other things in my home. Right. I have brought other things into my

70
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:26,720
home that I've tasted in the outside world that I've enjoyed. Today I tried two, this is not a joke,

71
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:30,720
I tried two different preparations of candied bacon because I'm trying to find the one that works

72
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:36,080
best for me and my family. I am here to tell you the results are private.

73
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:42,960
Well, you're still trying to get funding. You don't want to release the results too quickly,

74
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:46,080
or else no one's going to pay. Hey guys, as we're talking about salsa, did I ever tell you about

75
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:56,400
the time that I was in my high school TV news class? I say news, but it was really just fun

76
00:06:56,400 --> 00:07:03,280
vids for kids. I tried to make a cooking show using the condiment station at Huntington High

77
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:09,520
School. There's one episode where I did try to make salsa using packets of hot sauce and

78
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:16,720
banana peppers and tomatoes and lettuce. I didn't have a whole lot going on. I didn't have a lot

79
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:25,680
to work with. Can I tell you that I failed and what I created is unspeakable. Now you have IBS.

80
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:32,000
When I was in my TV production class in high school, I was not well liked at all. Everyone

81
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:37,280
thought nobody liked me in my TV production class, which was not a rarity in high school,

82
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:40,560
but it was really pronounced in the TV production class, which is somewhere I thought I would fit

83
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:49,440
in pretty well. The whole class was run by just jackbooted hillbilly thugs. One day I looked in

84
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:55,280
the TV monitor and I saw that they had trained a camera on me and written at the bottom of the TV

85
00:07:55,280 --> 00:08:01,440
monitor, Justin is a homosexual. I was upset not to be called a homosexual. That's fine. That's

86
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:08,400
their prerogative. At the bottom, I didn't know how to make words come up on the screen. I didn't

87
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:15,120
even know that was something we could do in class. I was upset about that because I thought that my

88
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:18,880
superiority intellectually would carry me, but I didn't even have that to hold over them anymore

89
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:24,160
because they had all these advanced video toaster techniques that I was not privy to.

90
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:35,200
Do they actually use those words or was it more colorful? That's the weird thing about it. If one

91
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:44,320
was making a nature documentary. On the sexuality spectrum, Justin lands closer to the homosexual

92
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:47,760
side of things. Observe him in his natural habitat, which is getting bullied in high school.

93
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:52,880
Do you guys just want to wrap this whole time? We've gone like nine minutes now without doing

94
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:56,880
a classroom. Yeah, let's keep going. What did that remind you guys of? High school?

95
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:04,000
I did a hard-hitting expose in my high school TV media class about why the third lunch period

96
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:10,800
always ran out of turkey clubs. When I was doing it, I fucking felt like I was cracking this case

97
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:16,320
wide open. Then the lunch lady informed me that it was because they were very popular,

98
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:21,840
so everybody ate them during the first two lunch periods. After that, she always held a turkey

99
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:27,840
club for me that I could eat. She would hide it under the table and then give it to me during

100
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:33,680
third lunch period. I appreciate that. Thank you very much. I did a hard-hitting expose. One day,

101
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:37,600
we all got pedometers in high school and then whoever racked up the highest count over the

102
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:42,240
course of a week got a bike. There were some kids that would just sit in class and shake their

103
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:46,480
pedometers to get that number going. I did a hard-hitting expose on pedometer shaking,

104
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:54,000
but it did devolve into just a bunch of jerk-off gags, like a bunch of jerk-off gags.

105
00:09:54,560 --> 00:10:02,160
One day, when I was in media production in middle school, we had a weekly news program for all of

106
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:07,360
Comac. I think it was WCMS was the name of the show because it was Comac Middle School and it

107
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:18,720
was the show. I used to do top 10 lists as a comedy segment on WCMS. I don't know if you guys

108
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:26,320
have heard about these top 10 lists, but they were ahead of the curve. Maybe I wasn't targeting my

109
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:36,560
audience very well. Maybe it was a little too adult, too grown up. I was fired from doing top

110
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:41,920
10 lists because they told me that they didn't want to do them anymore. The next week, I'm

111
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:51,840
sitting in class watching WCMS and what do I see? John Fraley on the screen doing a top 10 list,

112
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:58,720
stealing my bit I stole from David Letterman and just doing it like, here are some. They were like,

113
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:02,240
it was all fart gags. There was no nuance, nothing.

114
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:06,880
Now, Griffin, did you get to do KidsMag or was that just Justin and I?

115
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:10,480
No, I didn't get to do it. I was not invited on the air. I think they knew that

116
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,680
my material was a little bit too raw.

117
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:20,080
KidsMag was a local kids news program that was shown, I think, Saturday mornings,

118
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:26,320
Sunday mornings on WWK. It's great because I'm really glad that there's filmed evidence of what

119
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:33,840
giant, giant. Holy shit, what a dingus you are. Oh God, man. A Minkus, I would say. I was a solid

120
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:41,040
Minkus. You were Minkus Khan. They had to pay Travis for his life rights to Minkus.

121
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:45,760
They didn't want a lawsuit on their hands, so they actually paid him a nominal fee to be able

122
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:49,600
to use the character Minkus in Boy Meets World. I just picture Mom and Dad looking at me while

123
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:54,480
I was watching Boy Meets World and they were like, he's pretty close, but we could get closer.

124
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:59,120
And then they took a picture of Minkus and said, give us these glasses and this haircut

125
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:03,280
and whatever shirts you can find that kind of look like this, and then put them on the air.

126
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:07,040
Let's do our thing.

127
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:09,200
No, absolutely not. I refuse.

128
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:14,240
I spent like a half hour looking up Yahoo's, by which I mean going through our Gmail and

129
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:18,960
picking my favorite Yahoo's. And I don't want that work to be for naught. I already had 20 minutes

130
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:23,440
wasted for me today. Use them next week. They'll keep. I feel like people are gonna get angry if

131
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:30,960
we don't do advice. I'm showing, not telling. I'm showing through my life experience how to live.

132
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:36,720
Okay, so what have we said so far that's been actionable? Take cold showers,

133
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:45,120
individually wrapped salsa packets. But do be a Minkus, Travis, because you were a happy kid.

134
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:50,800
You know my one regret, Griffin? I didn't embrace it. I was a very smart kid. I was

135
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:56,400
in the advanced programs, but I wanted to be cool. And I was so worried about that,

136
00:12:56,400 --> 00:13:03,920
that I didn't just like go on to be a very rich doctor or a lawyer or engineer or scientist.

137
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:07,200
Isn't it funny how like, I don't think I was a smart kid. I think I was really,

138
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:12,240
really good at taking tests. And like, whenever I talk about like now that I'm an adult,

139
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:16,320
and I talk about being in the tag classes and the talented and gifted classes, and I brag,

140
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:22,480
I'm bragging. But really, I know in my heart of hearts that I just really was psyched to like

141
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:29,520
twice a week play Island of the Zoombinis. Yeah. Do a math blaster? Do some math blaster. And I

142
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:33,280
did great at math blaster. Again, I do not think I was especially smart. I think I was just like

143
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:39,520
dope at video games. And I didn't, I refused. I was, I was defiant against learning anything

144
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:42,800
from the Island of the Zoombinis. They were trying to teach me problem solving skills,

145
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:47,520
trying to teach me logic, reasoning, morals. And I said, thank you Zoombinis for the lessons,

146
00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:51,280
but I will ignore those. I'm just trying to get a high score because I'm a number one, 100% gamer.

147
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:57,600
I remember we built a toothpick bridges. We did some Coke can like balancing scale.

148
00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:01,920
I built a toothpick version of Jeff Bridges and he was my boyfriend for a while.

149
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:09,040
Here's the thing. When I described the tag class to people, people often don't believe me that I

150
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:13,600
got into it because of how especially smart I was because when I described, well, we would lay in

151
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:19,520
like a pillow thing and read. And the kids hear it. Yeah. And then we would, we would play math

152
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:25,200
blaster and people were like, and this was for especially smart kids. I think the more I think

153
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:29,760
about tag, the tag classes we're in, did we explain that means talented and gifted? Yeah.

154
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:35,120
Tag. That's what that stands for. Not smart, not smart. Listen to the words. Not smart,

155
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:41,360
talented and gifted euphemism and euphemism. I think, I think really that where I think about

156
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:46,880
it, it was more of like a, a wedgie quarantine. Like these kids, these kids are not going to

157
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:51,760
survive. They are not going to live to middle school and we can't lose another one. We have to

158
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:56,400
cordon them off to keep them from the rest of the kids just so they are not nuclear wedgie.

159
00:14:56,400 --> 00:15:01,200
Yeah. I was going to talented and gifted classes. It was like Tuesday and Thursday. And on Wednesday,

160
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:07,680
I was going to speech therapy. So really just like I was leaving class three out of five days

161
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:12,400
of the week to go be weird. Who's that kid? I don't know. He comes around sometimes. I think

162
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:17,280
he's a ghost. I think he's a minkus. Should we bully him? Let's get to it tomorrow. Oops.

163
00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:24,320
There's your mistake. You gotta catch him on Monday and Friday. I gotta set it. Promise me

164
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:28,560
you'll remember this time guys. You have to remember this time we'll bully. I would, I would,

165
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:33,840
they would try to bully me and I'd be like, hold please sirs before you try to bully me a riddle.

166
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:39,680
You have one sheep, one sack of grain and one wolf and only two rafts to get them. Oh, oh,

167
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:44,400
nope. You're bullying me. It's happening. I'm being bullied right now. Didn't even want to take a

168
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:48,240
crack at it, huh? But then by fifth grade we were all on safety patrol and that's where you

169
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:54,400
wield the true power. Right. Everybody respects that. A safety gun.

170
00:15:54,400 --> 00:16:01,440
It's just for looks. I got fired. I got fired from safety patrol. Did you? I was a loose cannon.

171
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:08,080
What did you do? I got too many temerits. I mouthed off the teachers. What the, what? Yeah. No you

172
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:14,800
didn't. I did. I was late to like a shit. It was like my third temerit and I was late to get out

173
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:19,040
to the corner and the teacher was like, you were late. And I was like, I don't think I was. And that

174
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:24,960
was my third temerit. And I got kicked off. I had to turn in my badge and sash. I really liked the

175
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:28,960
flag part of safety patrol. That's where you help people cross the street. Did every school have

176
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:33,440
safety patrol and fire patrol? I don't know. I don't know if they did or not. I'm just going

177
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:37,920
to assume that they did. And I had a big flag that I would use to help kids cross the street,

178
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:44,640
but really it was a bo staff like Donatello had in the teenage turtles. And I would, I would

179
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:49,280
flail it around and do all kinds of stick and stick like stunts with it. And I realized now as

180
00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:54,960
a 28 year old man that maybe I just wanted to be in flag core, but I also wanted a badge and they

181
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:59,360
don't give you those in flag core. I know there's no badges. I also think that now most of that

182
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:03,760
safety stuff is done by adults because somebody realized that what they were doing was putting

183
00:17:03,760 --> 00:17:10,400
the lives of children into the hands of children and then sending the children with sashes to stand

184
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:15,600
in the middle of the street. Yeah. Yeah. Can you imagine like the, like their children,

185
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:20,880
like they're still chill that you're giving the children, the power to stop cars. Like,

186
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:27,440
what are you doing? All right. Stephen, you got this, right? Like you can barely tie your shoes,

187
00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:33,680
but you can like decide when is it safe, right? Okay. Have fun. I remembered the one time that

188
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:41,280
this girl walked around my flag. What? She didn't respect, she didn't respect the staff

189
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:46,720
or the badge. She just walked around and I tried to stop her and I couldn't. And that's when I

190
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:52,320
realized that authority is meaningless. It's all an illusion, Justin. It's all an illusion. You can

191
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:55,920
build your own bridges. You know, she taught me a powerful lesson that day. Your own Jeff Bridges

192
00:17:55,920 --> 00:18:02,000
to be your boyfriend. So you guys are on safety patrol and fire patrol. Do you guys remember in

193
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:07,360
safety patrol there being a rush on the really good flag staff? Oh yeah. I remember we had some

194
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:12,000
that were like kind of crummy and threadbare. They were like frayed on the end too. Yeah. Yeah. And

195
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:15,200
I was always afraid to get those cause I thought I'd break it accidentally. And that's a big

196
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:20,640
demerit there. Was it bamboo? It was bamboo. Yeah. It was like bamboo staffs that they attach flags

197
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:26,080
to. With a blade on the end, a crude bronze blade. I will, I will also say, I want to say it was

198
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:32,880
Ms. Wilson was the head teacher of safety patrol. To her credit, even though I was kicked off of

199
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:39,760
safety patrol, I was still allowed to attend the yearly event at Camden park celebrating all the

200
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:46,960
safety patrol. I was just shows up, but beard all grizzled, fucking Hawaiian shirt, half unbuttoned,

201
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:52,880
like a ring of cocaine still around. Hey, you guys still patrolling? You know, I still got it.

202
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:57,680
I could patrol right now. No problem. Down at Camden park and all the other safety patrol

203
00:18:57,680 --> 00:19:02,080
kids were rounded up and I was left as like the rogue guy. Cause they were like, he's not

204
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:06,960
in safety patrol. He didn't even have a sash, but I still had all the wherewithal. Yeah. I fucking,

205
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:11,360
I saved all of them. Swimming through the log flume, like popping up, slitting a dude's throat.

206
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:17,040
Or safely escorting him through traffic. Yeah. That's another thing. One of those two things.

207
00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:21,680
Their whole plan hinged on running through traffic and the, luckily there was one man

208
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:28,640
there able to stop him. I was captain of the fire patrol one year. Got. Whoa. Yeah. I got a lot of

209
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:39,280
puts. I was talking about, uh, uh, getting fired from the patrol and, uh, it reminded me of one of

210
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:44,560
the two times I've ever been fired at a job. One of course was cause I stole a copy of fight club

211
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:50,080
and got fired from blockbuster. Among other things, among other things, show girls, the VHS tape.

212
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:54,320
No, it didn't. I had Tommy read, uh, while we were on vacation, he taped that off at HBO for me. I

213
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:57,360
didn't need to get that. You had that. God, this is the second time that we've had to do this

214
00:19:57,360 --> 00:20:03,360
intervention on the show before it had a blockbuster video box. I found your stash. I got a better,

215
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:09,760
I got a better copy later, but that was like, I didn't need it. Um, so I got fired from,

216
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:14,480
did you guys know I got fired at the pub? I used to be, I, you know how I'm always telling jokes

217
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:22,720
and doing like jicanery and stuff. Well, well, uh, that job, that, that proclivity for entertainment

218
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:30,160
got, um, it got me a job at the pub, uh, and family fun center as a weekly, uh, weeknight DJ

219
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:34,160
on Fridays and Saturday nights. I'd be the one up there spinning CDs and playing everybody's hits

220
00:20:34,160 --> 00:20:40,880
from the fifties, sixties, seventies, and today. Um, and I, uh, they constantly wanted me to add

221
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:45,200
new stunts, new like tricks and stunts to my repertoire while people were trying to eat some

222
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:52,640
fucking pizza. Yeah. Devil, devil sticks. Yeah. Yeah. The guy named Chad that I replaced,

223
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:58,560
he later came back. He got a job at circusy. He like was so, he, he had like a way with it. I

224
00:20:58,560 --> 00:21:03,760
don't know how he was able to do it, but I think he turned it up really loud and sometimes he would

225
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:12,640
light some, um, he would light the table on fire. That was like a cool trick. I got demoted from

226
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:18,000
that position. They like called me in. They're like, would you consider doing some extra stunts?

227
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:24,080
Like maybe trying to get people to do the YMCA or maybe bring in a suit and do a blues brothers

228
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:29,360
performance with somebody else. And I said, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, not, not, not, not, not,

229
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:35,520
not. What a crazy thing to ask. What a, what a crazy thing that you were working in the arcade.

230
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:41,920
You were like ticket exchange. No, I got demoted to that, to that. You were, you were front room.

231
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:47,040
You were at the big show. I was in the big show. And then I had to watch the big show while I

232
00:21:47,040 --> 00:21:53,040
fucking unjammed a token out of the, the, uh, sunset writers machine. Sure. They moved you

233
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:58,640
from the place where you did not belong to the place where you absolutely belonged.

234
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:02,880
Because maybe I just love that job for you because one time me and Alex White rolled up,

235
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:07,440
we're like, Hey, we're going to beat this Sega underwater shooter game. And it would,

236
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:11,040
otherwise it would cost you $130 in quarters to do that. And you're like, let me show you

237
00:22:11,040 --> 00:22:14,560
a special switch. And you show a special switch when you played it all day long. It was the best

238
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:21,920
day of my life. So still dirty that day. No, still, still. Sorry, Rachel. Um, yeah,

239
00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:26,800
I liked working back in the arcade. That was a good gig. Did you ever steal shit? What?

240
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:31,840
Did you ever steal shit? What am I going to steal? I'm going to jeopardize my job so I can

241
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:36,720
take home 30 wacky wall gummy crawlers. Like really one of those pencil toppers. Let me say

242
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:43,120
this. You work at an establishment, uh, where you sell things that you like and you steal from it.

243
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:46,320
And it's great because now you have the things that you like, right? The, the arcade, there's

244
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:52,480
not a lot of stuff that you like there. Unless you steal like a, like a, an arcade game. Well,

245
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:56,160
yes. If you can see, if you can get the sunset writers into your car, then it was never the pubs

246
00:22:56,160 --> 00:23:02,080
to begin with. It was just waiting for you. Right. Um, but what I'm saying is it's less about what

247
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:07,600
you like and more about like sort of the, you steal the fog machine, right? You steal the disco

248
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:15,200
ball. That's 30,000 tickets. That's so like the, the, the fiscal sense that that makes, right? Like

249
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:19,360
you know, you're stealing a 30,000 ticket item. I'm not saying you steal a bunch of tootsie rolls

250
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:24,880
for five tickets a pop. I'm saying you steal the bike for 200,000 tickets. Right. And you know that

251
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:29,360
like there's no way anybody would ever get that thing. And so like the, I don't know. I would

252
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:33,040
think I would find that just deeply, deeply rewarding, but that stuff was always there.

253
00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:38,000
That's like, that's like why I couldn't steal the bike. The bike was like part of the decoration.

254
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:43,760
I think it had a fucking chips logo on it. Like if you move the bike, the paint underneath was

255
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:50,400
a different color. Absolutely. Like you couldn't take the bike. Everybody would notice that.

256
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:55,120
Did you work at Tilt too? Or am I dreaming now? Nah, nah, nah. I didn't work at Tilt. I applied to Tilt but

257
00:23:55,120 --> 00:24:00,480
didn't make that. But you know what? Considering sort of financially what became of Arcade specifically

258
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:06,000
Tilt, which is now a Primitives store at the mall. That was probably- Did you know I live around the

259
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:09,760
corner from a Primitives? I could spit on a Primitives. I could open up my window right

260
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:13,440
now and spit on a Primitives. I wouldn't think Austin would be like a hotspot for Primitives.

261
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:19,200
Wait, what is Primitives? They sell a lot of things made of cow hide. For us, it's like,

262
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:24,240
I don't know, sort of a fake pioneer. Like if all the pioneers had like unlimited- Oh,

263
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:29,280
interesting. So a bunch of like corn husk dolls and- That kind of thing. Maybe some whisk brooms.

264
00:24:29,280 --> 00:24:35,280
See for our Primitives, it sells just a lot of things made out of cow hide. A lot of reclaimed

265
00:24:35,280 --> 00:24:42,080
wood. A lot of like things that you would see in a wealthier person that maybe lives up in the

266
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:46,400
hills but they still want to like keep it real so they have like a few wooden Native Americans.

267
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:50,960
Oh, see. So like here in Los Angeles, it would be like old film reels and like really vintage

268
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:57,840
cocaine. Yeah, exactly. That's hard too because it sticks together and you just get big rocks of it.

269
00:24:57,840 --> 00:25:01,760
I mean, yeah, at that point, it's more of a showpiece than a practical thing unless,

270
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:04,960
you know, you get really late at night and all the other cocaine has run out and then you're like,

271
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:11,040
well, and that's when you like crack open your canter of cocaine. You dig through your fridge

272
00:25:11,040 --> 00:25:14,560
and you're like, there's gotta be some cocaine here somewhere. And then you just cut away the

273
00:25:14,560 --> 00:25:18,560
moldy part of the cocaine and it's still good. It's still good, man. Still that booger sugar

274
00:25:18,560 --> 00:25:24,000
still gonna get you feeling so right. Get in the pool. Hey, get in the pool.

275
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:25,680
Do you guys ever do cocaine? No.

276
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:32,240
No. I don't think that's like a crazy question. Someone out there is doing cocaine.

277
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:36,640
Yeah. Hey, hey, someone's gotta be doing it, right? We're talking about it. Someone's gotta

278
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:40,880
be doing it. Somebody's gonna win. I remember in college fighting out their girlfriend of mine had

279
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:47,680
done cocaine at her senior prom. Nice. It rapid, it like drastically changed my opinion of her

280
00:25:47,680 --> 00:25:53,520
like in a split second where I went, oh. And like the, I was 21 at the time and the thought

281
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:58,880
that flashed in my head was, I think she's too hardcore for me because she had done cocaine once.

282
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:07,200
I was a babe. I have been places, I have lived places where cocaine was enjoyed irresponsibly.

283
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:15,280
Right. Basically every night. And one time me and my roommate took a Blockbuster DVD back

284
00:26:15,280 --> 00:26:21,360
for one of said enjoyers. Just doing them a quickie favor and we ran it to the Blockbuster

285
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:24,880
and when the guy opened it up to make sure the disc was in there, a very small bag of cocaine

286
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:29,920
fell out. Let me grab that. To my roommate's credit, to my roommate's credit, it was like a

287
00:26:29,920 --> 00:26:39,360
like a three card Monty dealer. Like that level of subtlety. He just like put his hand on the,

288
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:43,760
put his hand like, no late fees. But like when he sat down there was some cocaine underneath it.

289
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:48,960
My friends Nick and Rusty, who were the guys hanging out in college,

290
00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:54,960
they took me under their wing and they did a lot of cocaine. Maybe not cocaine,

291
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:59,760
but definitely a lot of weed. I remember very clearly. Well those two aren't analogous at all.

292
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:04,720
No, I know. But I needed a way into talking about Nick and Rusty because the fun thing about hanging

293
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:08,480
out those cats is I literally hang out with them every single day. It was like the first place I

294
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:12,800
hung out that wasn't my parents. You know what I mean? Like I would be there constantly after school

295
00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:20,720
and they smoked weed every single day and I never did. But it was a very weird position to be in

296
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:27,600
because every day was the same routine of like, well let's go rent Jekyll and Hyde together again

297
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:32,800
from Blockbuster and get some of those pepperoni pan pizzas from the Super America. And I would

298
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:38,240
like, this is a good day for you guys? Like you're enjoying, you're having a fun day today? I was

299
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:47,600
more of like a weed mascot, I think. But then I began to question like, am I maybe, I'm not high,

300
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:54,080
but they do have me around every time. And every time they also eat pepperoni pizza from the Super

301
00:27:54,080 --> 00:28:00,560
America and also rent Jekyll and Hyde together again. So maybe am I part of the essential weed?

302
00:28:00,560 --> 00:28:02,800
Like am I the Doritos of people?

303
00:28:02,800 --> 00:28:05,520
You're the Doritos of dudes.

304
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:09,520
I mean, that's the only way they can, maybe they only liked me when they were high? I don't know

305
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:10,080
exactly what role I was playing there.

306
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:13,680
No, no, no, no, Justin. Everybody likes pepperoni pizza all the time.

307
00:28:13,680 --> 00:28:14,320
Right, sure.

308
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:16,080
You just like it more when you're high.

309
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:18,720
It heightened the experience of hanging out with me.

310
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:22,240
You could really get every sense of the Justin McElroy when you're high.

311
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:30,720
We actually, oh, I actually helped to fund a drug dealing operation. They wanted to get

312
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:34,960
into selling weed. This was at Rusty, it was a friend of his whose name escapes me,

313
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:36,640
but he wanted to get into selling weed.

314
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:37,600
Hooba Stank, his name is Hooba Stank.

315
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:39,680
His name was Hooba Stank.

316
00:28:39,680 --> 00:28:43,040
Hooba J Stank.

317
00:28:43,040 --> 00:28:49,360
I gave him some money on the promise that my investment of money would be returned to me

318
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:54,240
because he would purchase weed and then sell it to me and then give me back more money

319
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:55,280
than I had given him.

320
00:28:55,280 --> 00:29:02,400
Are you just now realizing the repercussions for your actions, Heisenberg?

321
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:05,040
We're way past the, what's it called?

322
00:29:05,040 --> 00:29:06,480
Statute of Limitations.

323
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:09,760
Statute of Limitations on this. And I'm joking, it's a podcast.

324
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:13,440
But the-

325
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:15,760
Dude, you get the money back. Don't leave me on pins and needles.

326
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:19,360
What? Yeah, I made like $10, so worth it.

327
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:22,480
So what you're saying is selling drugs, good way to go.

328
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:25,760
Pays off. Well, no, not selling drugs. I never saw the product.

329
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:30,320
Just being a venture capitalist in the drug world.

330
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:30,640
Yes.

331
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:36,960
You weren't Heisenberg, you were Gus Fring. You were in charge of the whole thing.

332
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:42,720
And at the top of the ladder, Justin Kingpin McElroy.

333
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:47,680
Yeah, can I ask what your name, your cool drug guy name was?

334
00:29:47,680 --> 00:29:51,200
I didn't have a drug guy name, but we did have a name for our corporation.

335
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:52,800
It was called Balls Out United.

336
00:29:52,800 --> 00:29:53,760
Come on.

337
00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:55,040
I was in college, what do you want from me?

338
00:29:55,040 --> 00:29:58,720
So you really were in business with Hubert J. Stankington.

339
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:04,560
It was easy money. Here's what I will say about selling drugs.

340
00:30:04,560 --> 00:30:08,400
No, here's what I will say about funding drug sales. It's easy money.

341
00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:12,480
10 of them. It's easy 10 money units.

342
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:15,920
You know, people say like every time you buy drugs, you're also helping to fund terrorism

343
00:30:15,920 --> 00:30:16,720
because of their whole thing.

344
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:23,200
But keep in mind that by buying drugs, you might just be helping me to buy that one last

345
00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:28,160
Marvel Legends action figure I needed to complete the robot

346
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:30,640
that had like one piece of his body in each package.

347
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:32,400
Remember that?

348
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:36,880
Yeah, I do. I'm sorry. I'm just like, I guess I'm like disappointed in you.

349
00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:39,520
Well, I mean, I'm kind of disappointed too because I can

350
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:44,800
retrospect that's pretty heavy, but at the time it seemed like a very accessible way.

351
00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:46,000
Can I ask how much you put in?

352
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:51,280
Yeah, like $75, I think.

353
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:54,560
It was not a major investment.

354
00:30:54,560 --> 00:30:58,480
Were you, wait, were you the sole investor or did you have like a 10% stake?

355
00:30:58,480 --> 00:31:00,560
Yeah, I was the money man.

356
00:31:00,560 --> 00:31:08,800
Okay, let me put it this way. If you're trying to bust this guy and your plan was follow the money.

357
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:14,080
But this is just in quarters. Does he work at an arcade? What the fuck?

358
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:18,000
Yeah. Why are there pub pizza family fund center tokens in here?

359
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:20,480
If you follow the money, it would have led to me.

360
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:22,880
You would have thought that I was the kingpin of this organization.

361
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:28,560
It would have been just like two Polaroids on a cork board with just like one line between us.

362
00:31:28,560 --> 00:31:36,400
Justin, can I say how much money I would pay for a just interrogation video of 19 year old Justin

363
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:41,440
McElroy with like two cops with like a bright light shining in his face. It's all I want.

364
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:42,880
With his frosted tips.

365
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:49,920
Sorry, I've been waiting for an opportunity to talk to you about your frosted tips.

366
00:31:49,920 --> 00:31:53,920
They would have dropped a bag of weed on the table and said,

367
00:31:53,920 --> 00:31:56,640
so does this look familiar? And I could look dead in the eye and say,

368
00:31:56,640 --> 00:32:00,640
I do not know what that is. And then they said,

369
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:04,800
this is $75 worth of weed because it's 1936.

370
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:13,360
What if they could have literally put like construction paper leaves of marijuana

371
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:17,840
in a pile on the table and they would said, does this look familiar? And I would have

372
00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:21,040
not literally not known if they were messing with me or not.

373
00:32:21,040 --> 00:32:24,960
Is this what weed is? I have no idea. I'm just the money man.

374
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:36,080
Speaking of money.

375
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:38,400
We deserve money for not doing advice.

376
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:42,800
Yep. Yeah. Oh, absolutely. We get, we get our money no matter what.

377
00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:45,920
We need to buy and sell weed.

378
00:32:46,560 --> 00:32:50,720
Yeah. My brother, my brother, me is supported in part by harrys.com,

379
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:55,120
which offers high quality shave better for your face and better for your wallet.

380
00:32:55,120 --> 00:32:58,560
I'm a huge fan of Harry's products that make great razors.

381
00:32:58,560 --> 00:33:03,440
I love their aftershave. They have an aftershave lotion that I adore.

382
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:06,320
I love their beforeshave. The pre-shave.

383
00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:08,960
I love the during shave lotion that you're doing with your left hand

384
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:10,880
while you're shaving with your right. Yeah.

385
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:15,200
It's next level shave maneuvers. You don't want to do this if it's your first time shaving.

386
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:17,440
It's like you're patching, it's like you're patching drywall.

387
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:18,720
Yeah. The wall is your face.

388
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:21,840
I like the intra-shave lotion, which is between two shaves.

389
00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:24,720
When you think I really should shave, you just need to calm down a little bit

390
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:26,320
and not shave. That's a great lotion.

391
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:28,080
I like the anti-shave lotion.

392
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:31,120
And you put it on your face and it's like the Santa Claus movie.

393
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:32,320
Hair just grows right back.

394
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:36,480
Speaking of, hey listeners who join me on Periscope, thank you so much.

395
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:38,800
I'm just going to go ahead and cover this one outright.

396
00:33:38,800 --> 00:33:40,960
People will keep asking, how did I grow my beard?

397
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:42,480
Just didn't shave it.

398
00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:44,080
Don't shave it.

399
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:45,680
Just stop shaving.

400
00:33:45,680 --> 00:33:49,440
But you do want to shave and Harry's is going to help you do that with a $15 starter set

401
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:52,960
that includes a razor foaming shave gel or shave cream

402
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:56,560
and three razor blades plus free shipping.

403
00:33:56,560 --> 00:33:59,680
$15, that's a great deal, but we're going to make it even better.

404
00:33:59,680 --> 00:34:04,480
If you go to harrys.com and use the coupon code, my brother,

405
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:08,960
use the code, my brother, all one word, you can save $5 off that starter set.

406
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:12,960
And too often a lot of shave stuff is always marketed like directly towards men,

407
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:13,760
which is a mistake.

408
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:15,680
I think that Harry's is good for everybody.

409
00:34:15,680 --> 00:34:17,120
Anybody will like using Harry's.

410
00:34:17,120 --> 00:34:22,960
It's an excellent quality razor where you get really reasonably priced blades.

411
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:23,840
Teresa uses it.

412
00:34:23,840 --> 00:34:24,400
She loves it.

413
00:34:25,360 --> 00:34:29,760
So that code again, my brother, go to harrys.com, use coupon code, my brother,

414
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:32,720
and save $5 off of that starter set.

415
00:34:32,720 --> 00:34:34,080
Travis, who's our next sponsor?

416
00:34:34,080 --> 00:34:37,040
Oh, that would be a little company called Squarespace.

417
00:34:37,680 --> 00:34:39,360
Squarespace is a gigantic company.

418
00:34:39,360 --> 00:34:39,920
They're immediate.

419
00:34:39,920 --> 00:34:41,600
Griffin, I was doing, it was ironic.

420
00:34:41,600 --> 00:34:44,080
My brother, my brother and me is brought to you in part by Squarespace,

421
00:34:44,080 --> 00:34:45,840
the all-in-one website platform.

422
00:34:45,840 --> 00:34:48,320
At this point, is there anybody who like,

423
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:51,200
what's the Venn diagram of people who listen to podcasts,

424
00:34:51,200 --> 00:34:53,040
but don't know what Squarespace is?

425
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:56,720
I mean, there's only one website on the internet that doesn't use Squarespace,

426
00:34:56,720 --> 00:35:00,800
and it's the Space Jam website that's still in operation after all these years.

427
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:02,400
Can you please just fucking talk about Squarespace?

428
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:04,560

Squarespace, build it beautiful.

435
00:35:19,840 --> 00:35:22,080
You know, I used Squarespace to design this week.

436
00:35:22,080 --> 00:35:25,760
Actually, I used Squarespace to make a website for things I bought at Sheets,

437
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:30,080
which you can find at Sheets with a Z, show.com.

438
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:35,440
And I designed that with Squarespace, and it doesn't look very, very good,

439
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:36,800
but it looks okay.

440
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:38,640
It looks better than it deserves.

441
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:40,960
It looks better than it deserves, and I only spent an hour on it.

442
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:43,760
Like, if I spent a little bit more time, I could make it look really good.

443
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:49,120
But, like, Squarespace, they really make it easy for you to make a website.

444
00:35:49,120 --> 00:35:55,040
And that was, don't use Sheets show.com as, like, your meter

445
00:35:55,040 --> 00:35:58,080
for how all Squarespace sites should look.

446
00:35:58,080 --> 00:36:01,040
But I did that very quickly, which is a compliment to Squarespace.

447
00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:04,800
So go to Squarespace.com and use the coupon code, MYBROTHER, all one word.

448
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:08,960
I got my things I bought at Sheets shirt in today, or yesterday.

449
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:10,160
Pics or it didn't happen.

450
00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:12,560
I mean, I got it in, and it's a nice shirt, and it looks nice,

451
00:36:12,560 --> 00:36:13,280
and I like the design.

452
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:16,160
It has a very bad smell, and I don't know what the reason is for that,

453
00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:17,440
but I'm excited to wash it and wear it.

454
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:19,520
Each shirt is scented like a Sheets.

455
00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:21,520
Sheets smells great.

456
00:36:21,520 --> 00:36:22,160
Don't be an idiot.

457
00:36:22,160 --> 00:36:24,240
I got a message for Susan, and it's from Grant.

458
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:25,760
Message is this.

459
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:26,640
It reads thusly.

460
00:36:26,640 --> 00:36:28,480
Dear Susan, happy anniversary.

461
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:30,400
Wherever the brothers decide it should happen,

462
00:36:31,120 --> 00:36:34,640
I'd like to take this opportunity to pay the McElroy's to say nice things about you.

463
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:38,960
For example, they could compliment you on your blossoming video game skills,

464
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:41,600
your girls show prowess,

465
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:46,400
or promise you they'd never lose you in a department store.

466
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:47,120
Allons-y.

467
00:36:51,120 --> 00:36:53,760
I want to compliment you on your blossoming video game skills,

468
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:58,560
but that feels like a weird like, girl, you'll be a woman soon.

469
00:36:59,680 --> 00:37:00,800
It's the word blossoming.

470
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:02,240
Yeah.

471
00:37:02,240 --> 00:37:03,440
Blossoming creeps me out.

472
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:04,720
Burgeoning.

473
00:37:04,720 --> 00:37:07,840
Your burgeoning video game skills, your development, nope.

474
00:37:07,840 --> 00:37:08,340
Nope.

475
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:09,140
Nope.

476
00:37:09,680 --> 00:37:10,240
Wrong.

477
00:37:10,240 --> 00:37:11,120
You're flowering.

478
00:37:11,120 --> 00:37:11,680
No.

479
00:37:11,680 --> 00:37:12,240
No, can't.

480
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:14,000
You won't.

481
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:16,640
Your cycle.

482
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:20,240
Happy anniversary, Susan.

483
00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:21,600
Travis, tell me about this next message.

484
00:37:21,600 --> 00:37:22,800
Can I read a message?

485
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:23,360
Yes.

486
00:37:23,360 --> 00:37:26,960
This message is for Tyler, and it's from Snugglebeard.

487
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:28,640
Snugglebeard says to Tyler,

488
00:37:28,640 --> 00:37:31,280
since we have to check Facebook to learn our anniversary,

489
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:35,280
I figured our favorite brotherly trio's timely method of message delivery

490
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:36,880
wouldn't be too problematic.

491
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:39,520
I love you, my paycheck in a jock strap.

492
00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:40,880
Wait, let me try that again.

493
00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:43,360
I love you, my paycheck in a jock strap.

494
00:37:43,360 --> 00:37:46,320
I can't wait until all the jokes about you leaving me

495
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:48,240
because I'm too old come true.

496
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:50,240
Now, please take your dishes to the sink.

497
00:37:50,240 --> 00:37:51,440
Ooh, Tyler, that's no joke.

498
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:52,800
Oh, Tyler busted.

499
00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:55,120
Tyler, you leave those dishes out,

500
00:37:55,120 --> 00:37:57,520
you're going to get dried Captain Crunch on the side of the bowl.

501
00:37:57,520 --> 00:37:58,320
That's never coming off.

502
00:37:58,320 --> 00:38:00,960
Also, Snugglebeard's not even asking you to put them in the dishwasher.

503
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:01,920
Take them to the sink.

504
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:02,880
Just take them to the sink.

505
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:03,760
That's nothing.

506
00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:04,720
That's purgatory.

507
00:38:04,720 --> 00:38:06,080
That's dishes purgatory.

508
00:38:06,080 --> 00:38:08,480
Happy anniversary, you two.

509
00:38:09,360 --> 00:38:11,280
Hey, you like t-shirts, right?

510
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:12,880
How about a mug?

511
00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:15,760
Are your walls looking a little bare?

512
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:21,120

MaxFunStore.com

517
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:39,840
Speaking of dishes, I made that candied bacon on a cookie sheet.

518
00:38:39,840 --> 00:38:43,120
I made it on a rack, on a cookie cooling rack,

519
00:38:43,120 --> 00:38:44,960
on top of a drying sheet to let the grease drip off

520
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:46,800
and let the canning process take place.

521
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:50,960
And I stupidly put the dish into the,

522
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:52,640
put the pan into the sink when I was done,

523
00:38:52,640 --> 00:38:53,680
ran cool water on it.

524
00:38:54,240 --> 00:38:57,760
Fucking instantly, instantly knew,

525
00:38:57,760 --> 00:38:59,040
well, I'm throwing this out.

526
00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:00,240
This is going to the trash.

527
00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:01,920
I need to buy a new cookie sheet today.

528
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:04,000
It's completely gone, completely destroyed.

529
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:05,200
We'll never get it off.

530
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:06,800
It was a big grease.

531
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:08,240
It was great.

532
00:39:08,240 --> 00:39:09,120
No, it's not just grease.

533
00:39:09,120 --> 00:39:10,880
Grease I could work with, but the candy.

534
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:14,720
The candy mixed with the grease crystallized

535
00:39:14,720 --> 00:39:16,240
and it was just seized onto it.

536
00:39:16,240 --> 00:39:16,880
It's never coming off.

537
00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:18,240
Justin, I want to get into this candy.

538
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:22,720
Were you doing a brown sugar or a praline thing?

539
00:39:22,720 --> 00:39:24,080
Oh, this isn't going to be funny.

540
00:39:24,080 --> 00:39:25,120
No, this is a serious-

541
00:39:25,120 --> 00:39:26,240
I just want it to be funny.

542
00:39:26,240 --> 00:39:27,440
No, but it does, it does, it does.

543
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:29,200
It's like in iTunes, whenever you click

544
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:31,280
like my brother, my brother, me, it shows up

545
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:34,080
under the comedy tab, not under the like cooking.

546
00:39:34,080 --> 00:39:36,480
Well, it could be 96% comedy.

547
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:37,120
No, it can't.

548
00:39:37,120 --> 00:39:38,400
Just real brother talk.

549
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:39,040
I can't.

550
00:39:39,040 --> 00:39:40,400
We've done, no, it can't.

551
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:41,680
This won't even be real brother talk.

552
00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:43,120
I just need to know if it was Fraley-

553
00:39:43,120 --> 00:39:45,520
No, listen, listen, listen, listen.

554
00:39:45,520 --> 00:39:46,320
I'm not going to care.

555
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:47,520
We can talk about it.

556
00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:48,080
We can talk about this.

557
00:39:48,080 --> 00:39:49,520
I'm just not going to care very much about it.

558
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:50,560
Is this in the show?

559
00:39:50,560 --> 00:39:51,360
I can't tell if this is in the show.

560
00:39:51,360 --> 00:39:52,000
Yeah, yeah, for sure.

561
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:52,800
All of this is in the show.

562
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:54,560
Listen, hey, hey.

563
00:39:54,560 --> 00:39:56,080
This is our Outback Steakhouse episode.

564
00:39:56,080 --> 00:39:57,760
No fucking rules, just right.

565
00:39:57,760 --> 00:39:59,600
I'm not going to care talking about candy bacon.

566
00:39:59,600 --> 00:40:00,640
The people listening aren't going to care,

567
00:40:00,640 --> 00:40:01,360
and they're certainly not going to laugh at it.

568
00:40:01,360 --> 00:40:02,400
Why don't you care?

569
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:04,720
Like when you care if you made it and you enjoyed it?

570
00:40:04,720 --> 00:40:04,960
Yeah, but I can get on-

571
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:06,720
Or if you made it for you, if someone gave it to you

572
00:40:06,720 --> 00:40:07,520
as a present.

573
00:40:07,520 --> 00:40:09,760
Okay, but I'm not going, I'm going to get on all recipes

574
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:10,560
and look up the right way to do it.

575
00:40:10,560 --> 00:40:12,000
No, here's what I'm telling you.

576
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:13,680
You can't just say a bunch of horse shit

577
00:40:13,680 --> 00:40:15,120
and expect to get away with it.

578
00:40:15,120 --> 00:40:16,960
The thing I'm telling you about candy bacon

579
00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:19,120
is that literally 80% of the recipes

580
00:40:19,120 --> 00:40:20,640
you read on the internet about candy bacon

581
00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:22,400
are a fucking lie.

582
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:25,120
They will make something that is utterly inedible

583
00:40:25,120 --> 00:40:26,480
that you cannot consume.

584
00:40:26,480 --> 00:40:27,520
It's garbage.

585
00:40:27,520 --> 00:40:31,120
I got a recipe from a judge on Chopped,

586
00:40:31,120 --> 00:40:33,920
and I tried her candy bacon, and it was a nightmare.

587
00:40:33,920 --> 00:40:34,240
Which one?

588
00:40:34,240 --> 00:40:35,440
It was inedible.

589
00:40:35,440 --> 00:40:35,920
Which judge?

590
00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:37,280
Alex, Alex.

591
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:38,480
See, she knows what she's talking about.

592
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:40,080
I would actually trust her more than I would trust you.

593
00:40:40,080 --> 00:40:40,320
Yeah.

594
00:40:40,320 --> 00:40:41,680
I'm not just about cooking about anything.

595
00:40:41,680 --> 00:40:43,280
No, but Justin's the man on the street.

596
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:44,640
He's been in the shit.

597
00:40:44,640 --> 00:40:45,120
I'm in the trenches with you.

598
00:40:45,120 --> 00:40:48,880
He isn't the general directing it from his ivory tower.

599
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:49,200
Justin-

600
00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:50,240
Just in the trenches.

601
00:40:50,240 --> 00:40:51,440
I love you, Justin.

602
00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:53,920
You're my brother, and you've helped me grow and mature

603
00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:55,680
and become the man I am today.

604
00:40:55,680 --> 00:41:01,520
And I will take a peer-reviewed candied bacon recipe

605
00:41:01,520 --> 00:41:04,160
off of the internet that has been peer-reviewed.

606
00:41:04,160 --> 00:41:06,000
I will get on LexisNexis,

607
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:09,760
and I will find peer-reviewed with thousands of ratings

608
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:11,680
of people saying, yum, yum, good bacon.

609
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:14,320
Do you know what all the comments on every recipe

610
00:41:14,320 --> 00:41:16,080
of good bacon recipes are?

611
00:41:16,080 --> 00:41:19,920
Are there people saying, this recipe is horseshit.

612
00:41:19,920 --> 00:41:21,200
Here's how I do it.

613
00:41:21,200 --> 00:41:22,720
And then there's a reply to that that's like,

614
00:41:22,720 --> 00:41:23,520
that will never work.

615
00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:24,640
That'll set your house on fire.

616
00:41:24,640 --> 00:41:25,760
Here's a real recipe for candied bacon.

617
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:27,040
But there's gotta be one.

618
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:28,720
You are a wonderful man,

619
00:41:28,720 --> 00:41:31,280
but you're not the computer that wore tennis shoes.

620
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:33,280
That's why I'm saying I was conducting research

621
00:41:33,280 --> 00:41:34,640
this morning, Griffin.

622
00:41:34,640 --> 00:41:36,640
If you'd listen for a second-

623
00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:39,280
I still wouldn't find the conversation exciting.

624
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:43,440
So is it praline, or is it just like brown sugar?

625
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:45,120
Just like brown sugar on top.

626
00:41:45,680 --> 00:41:47,920
And then I put it on a cookie rack, bake it in a foil.

627
00:41:47,920 --> 00:41:49,120
So you could do perfect bacon.

628
00:41:49,120 --> 00:41:51,360
Now Griffin, you know how to make perfect bacon, right?

629
00:41:51,360 --> 00:41:52,560
You make perfect bacon.

630
00:41:52,560 --> 00:41:53,520
There's a foolproof 100%.

631
00:41:53,520 --> 00:41:55,200
There's the bacon method.

632
00:41:55,200 --> 00:41:57,440
Start it in a cold oven, set it at 400,

633
00:41:57,440 --> 00:41:59,360
and wait about 15 minutes until it's done,

634
00:41:59,360 --> 00:42:00,400
and it'll be perfect.

635
00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:01,200
That's perfect bacon.

636
00:42:01,200 --> 00:42:04,960
I like a little cracked black pepper and cumin on it.

637
00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:10,320
Welcome to my house.

638
00:42:10,320 --> 00:42:12,160
Griffin's just playing Hearthstone now.

639
00:42:13,360 --> 00:42:13,920
Why not?

640
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:15,760
Hey, no rules just right.

641
00:42:15,760 --> 00:42:16,720
Why can't I play Hearthstone?

642
00:42:16,720 --> 00:42:17,600
If we're not gonna do advice,

643
00:42:17,600 --> 00:42:18,640
if we're not gonna do the thing,

644
00:42:19,760 --> 00:42:21,040
now it's our Hearthstone cast.

645
00:42:21,040 --> 00:42:23,200
I've been really enjoying playing the priest class lately,

646
00:42:23,200 --> 00:42:25,280
because there's a lot of card control cards,

647
00:42:25,280 --> 00:42:27,680
and I like to play those and really stump my enemies.

648
00:42:28,320 --> 00:42:29,600
Well, I'll just talk about Hearthstone

649
00:42:29,600 --> 00:42:30,800
if that's what you want to talk about.

650
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:32,080
I mean, Paladin's a good way to go,

651
00:42:32,080 --> 00:42:35,600
because then you have a lot of damage cards and healing cards.

652
00:42:35,600 --> 00:42:36,100
Listen.

653
00:42:36,560 --> 00:42:37,280
I'm listening.

654
00:42:38,320 --> 00:42:39,120
I don't have anything.

655
00:42:39,120 --> 00:42:40,640
I just didn't want to talk about bacon anymore.

656
00:42:41,680 --> 00:42:42,480
That's the first.

657
00:42:42,480 --> 00:42:43,600
Nobody's ever said that.

658
00:42:43,600 --> 00:42:44,800
Bacon has been ruined for me, okay?

659
00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:46,800
I live in Austin, and so it's like, it's in everything.

660
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:50,160
It did get kind of, bacon did get kind of ruined.

661
00:42:50,160 --> 00:42:51,600
It's not even the, it's not the food.

662
00:42:51,600 --> 00:42:52,480
It's not the eating it.

663
00:42:52,480 --> 00:42:55,200
I don't, I still get psyched if I'm like at a hotel.

664
00:42:55,200 --> 00:42:57,200
I like like shitty bacon kind of this way.

665
00:42:57,200 --> 00:42:59,600
I like like swag weed that like snickle frits,

666
00:42:59,600 --> 00:43:00,640
because you can smoke a lot of it.

667
00:43:00,640 --> 00:43:01,360
You know what I mean?

668
00:43:01,360 --> 00:43:03,760
And like, I like shitty, flat, floppy, shitty bacon.

669
00:43:03,760 --> 00:43:05,360
Because it's the fun of smoking weed

670
00:43:05,360 --> 00:43:06,640
that really appeals to you.

671
00:43:06,640 --> 00:43:07,760
Yeah, but, but-

672
00:43:07,760 --> 00:43:09,520
Oh no, I'm high already?

673
00:43:09,520 --> 00:43:09,920
I like-

674
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:11,920
I just started smoking this weed.

675
00:43:11,920 --> 00:43:12,420
No!

676
00:43:13,040 --> 00:43:13,360
I like-

677
00:43:13,360 --> 00:43:14,880
I'm so enjoying it.

678
00:43:14,880 --> 00:43:18,320
I like flat, flat hotel nightmare bacon.

679
00:43:19,120 --> 00:43:20,480
I still get excited about that, but like,

680
00:43:20,480 --> 00:43:24,160
like eating a vegetable and like you've opened up a fold of it

681
00:43:24,160 --> 00:43:27,440
and where you expected to find the life-giving seeds inside.

682
00:43:27,440 --> 00:43:29,120
There's like a bacon chutney.

683
00:43:29,120 --> 00:43:30,320
Like, I just can't get excited about that.

684
00:43:30,320 --> 00:43:32,160
But for me, it's not the eating of the bacon that's ruined it.

685
00:43:32,160 --> 00:43:35,840
It is the fact that bacon has become comedy.

686
00:43:35,840 --> 00:43:40,000
Like there, it is, it is its own sort of comedy food group

687
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:42,000
where it's just like, is this joke not working for you?

688
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:43,040
Just say something about bacon.

689
00:43:45,040 --> 00:43:46,160
It's, it's like not-

690
00:43:47,200 --> 00:43:48,560
It's not, bacon's not a punch line.

691
00:43:48,560 --> 00:43:52,240
No, it's thin pig that you fried up.

692
00:43:52,240 --> 00:43:55,920
It's not a, it's not a, some sort of clever play on words.

693
00:43:56,640 --> 00:44:00,320
We just, I think everybody in the nation got so excited

694
00:44:00,320 --> 00:44:03,280
that for once we found something that could unite us

695
00:44:03,280 --> 00:44:04,160
instead of divide us.

696
00:44:04,160 --> 00:44:06,400
Like, I think that was the thing that's like,

697
00:44:06,400 --> 00:44:09,360
we're such a divided country anymore, politically speaking

698
00:44:10,080 --> 00:44:12,720
and ideologically, religiously, I could go on,

699
00:44:12,720 --> 00:44:15,280
that we finally found one thing where we all were like,

700
00:44:15,280 --> 00:44:17,440
you know what, let's just put everything aside

701
00:44:17,440 --> 00:44:18,800
and just enjoy bacon first.

702
00:44:18,800 --> 00:44:21,840
And it was also like bad for you, but not like cigarettes,

703
00:44:21,840 --> 00:44:22,880
you know, not like-

704
00:44:22,880 --> 00:44:23,200
Right.

705
00:44:23,200 --> 00:44:25,440
And it was like, we're gonna be naughty

706
00:44:25,440 --> 00:44:26,880
and have some bacon today.

707
00:44:26,880 --> 00:44:28,720
How's it, I don't wanna talk about bacon anymore.

708
00:44:28,720 --> 00:44:29,840
How's your guys' summer?

709
00:44:31,280 --> 00:44:33,200
I haven't done shit yet.

710
00:44:33,200 --> 00:44:34,320
Okay, moving on to Justin.

711
00:44:37,520 --> 00:44:38,560
Fourth of July, you know?

712
00:44:39,920 --> 00:44:40,800
Okay, so that-

713
00:44:40,800 --> 00:44:42,960
Well, I wanted, Teresa and I wanna do some kind

714
00:44:42,960 --> 00:44:45,520
of vacation thing, but it's hard because like,

715
00:44:45,520 --> 00:44:48,320
one, it's not like we have the summers off from school.

716
00:44:48,880 --> 00:44:51,360
It's not that much different from any other month.

717
00:44:51,360 --> 00:44:53,520
And now that I am a professional podcaster,

718
00:44:54,080 --> 00:44:57,600
i.e. unemployed, it's not really like I have a job

719
00:44:57,600 --> 00:44:59,200
to take a vacation from.

720
00:44:59,200 --> 00:45:02,240
So it's really just spending money at that point.

721
00:45:02,240 --> 00:45:04,400
TV has led me to believe that La La Land

722
00:45:04,400 --> 00:45:06,720
is like a vacation 24 hours a day.

723
00:45:06,720 --> 00:45:08,880
I will say that there is like,

724
00:45:09,440 --> 00:45:11,120
if you've ever been on Atlas Obscura,

725
00:45:11,120 --> 00:45:12,880
which is really awesome and I highly recommend it,

726
00:45:12,880 --> 00:45:17,120
the website, there is like a thousand cool places

727
00:45:17,120 --> 00:45:20,560
to go in Los Angeles that cost nothing,

728
00:45:20,560 --> 00:45:23,360
that are like, here's a weird little adventure day.

729
00:45:23,360 --> 00:45:25,920
But that doesn't really feel like a vacation.

730
00:45:25,920 --> 00:45:28,640
That feels like, I just don't wanna be home for three hours.

731
00:45:29,680 --> 00:45:31,040
And so like, I don't know.

732
00:45:31,040 --> 00:45:33,040
I'm thinking about going to Disneyland, you guys.

733
00:45:33,040 --> 00:45:35,840
I'm 31 years old, haven't been to Disneyland yet.

734
00:45:35,840 --> 00:45:36,720
You have been to Disneyland.

735
00:45:36,720 --> 00:45:37,920
No, I've been to Disney World.

736
00:45:37,920 --> 00:45:39,440
I've been to Disney World, Griffin.

737
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:42,000
Yeah, I've always wondered about Disneyland.

738
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:44,000
I feel like it would be just different enough

739
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:46,320
from Walt Disney World that I would kind of get messed up.

740
00:45:46,320 --> 00:45:46,720
Yeah.

741
00:45:46,720 --> 00:45:48,640
Like it would kind of be hard to,

742
00:45:48,640 --> 00:45:49,520
like I would keep feeling

743
00:45:49,520 --> 00:45:51,280
like I was in a dissociative state or something.

744
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:54,320
I've been thinking about taking a Swaycation

745
00:45:54,320 --> 00:45:56,080
and let me know if this isn't funny.

746
00:45:56,080 --> 00:46:00,960
But it's, I'm gonna go like get lunch with my friend Sway.

747
00:46:01,520 --> 00:46:04,960
You know that I met Sway once when I was in college and-

748
00:46:04,960 --> 00:46:06,320
Yeah, you never let us forget it.

749
00:46:06,320 --> 00:46:08,000
We had lunch, I had lunch with Sway

750
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:10,560
and then the next day I had lunch with John Roberts.

751
00:46:10,560 --> 00:46:12,320
Pretty much the best two days.

752
00:46:13,760 --> 00:46:15,280
It goes in order, those two days

753
00:46:15,280 --> 00:46:17,040
and then the best day ever that I mentioned earlier

754
00:46:17,040 --> 00:46:18,400
in the show that I can't remember what I said.

755
00:46:19,600 --> 00:46:20,800
Listen, I've had a pretty good life.

756
00:46:21,360 --> 00:46:26,000
I like going out with Sway,

757
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:27,520
like different events and stuff like that.

758
00:46:27,520 --> 00:46:27,840
Yeah.

759
00:46:27,840 --> 00:46:29,440
But the one thing I don't like about it

760
00:46:29,440 --> 00:46:34,160
is that he always expects you to reserve a spot with the hang.

761
00:46:34,160 --> 00:46:37,520
He sounds like those really annoying RSVS's,

762
00:46:37,520 --> 00:46:39,680
the respondez-vous Sway.

763
00:46:39,680 --> 00:46:43,840
Yeah, and he makes you fill those out

764
00:46:43,840 --> 00:46:45,920
and return them to him before you can get a good hang.

765
00:46:45,920 --> 00:46:53,280
And then when you're on a cruise ship and it capsizes

766
00:46:53,280 --> 00:46:55,840
and then you and he are the only two survivors

767
00:46:55,840 --> 00:46:59,920
and you swim through the sunken channels

768
00:46:59,920 --> 00:47:02,080
and hallways of the ship to make it to the radio room

769
00:47:02,080 --> 00:47:05,440
to put out a save our Sway dispatch.

770
00:47:05,440 --> 00:47:11,520
And then he always talks about that 90s R&B,

771
00:47:11,520 --> 00:47:15,600
two man on 90s R&B group that he was in right before

772
00:47:15,600 --> 00:47:18,080
they made it huge and then they changed the name

773
00:47:19,120 --> 00:47:22,000
from Kid and Sway to Kid and Play

774
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:24,400
and then it was like and they just cut him out of the-

775
00:47:24,400 --> 00:47:25,120
Cut him out of the whole thing.

776
00:47:25,120 --> 00:47:28,080
What are the odds that 90% of our listeners

777
00:47:28,080 --> 00:47:30,240
have no idea who you're talking about?

778
00:47:30,240 --> 00:47:31,200
Oh, 100%.

779
00:47:31,200 --> 00:47:31,840
Okay, great.

780
00:47:31,840 --> 00:47:33,680
No, sorry, 100% of our listeners

781
00:47:33,680 --> 00:47:34,720
know exactly who we're talking about.

782
00:47:34,720 --> 00:47:35,440
He's fucking Sway.

783
00:47:37,120 --> 00:47:38,240
Do you guys want a Yahoo?

784
00:47:38,240 --> 00:47:38,480
What?

785
00:47:39,360 --> 00:47:40,400
What do you mean?

786
00:47:40,400 --> 00:47:40,960
A what who?

787
00:47:41,680 --> 00:47:42,160
A what?

788
00:47:43,120 --> 00:47:44,720
I'm worried people are listening to this going like,

789
00:47:44,720 --> 00:47:46,000
are they just going to change the whole show?

790
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:48,320
Is this- I can't stress this enough.

791
00:47:48,320 --> 00:47:50,640
This isn't us being lazy.

792
00:47:50,640 --> 00:47:53,120
This isn't us like not doing the pre-pro work.

793
00:47:53,120 --> 00:47:55,440
I'm looking at an email full of questions just right.

794
00:47:55,440 --> 00:47:56,240
Ooh, juicy, juicy questions.

795
00:47:56,240 --> 00:47:57,040
Extra questions.

796
00:47:57,040 --> 00:47:57,440
There's actually-

797
00:47:57,440 --> 00:47:57,680
Extra questions.

798
00:47:57,680 --> 00:47:59,440
I had eight questions as we can sort of say.

799
00:47:59,440 --> 00:48:02,640
I have like nine Yahoo's and we've got them all together

800
00:48:02,640 --> 00:48:05,280
and then at some point we just made this unconscious decision

801
00:48:05,280 --> 00:48:06,880
just to neglect them.

802
00:48:06,880 --> 00:48:09,840
If we don't go the full hour, like-

803
00:48:09,840 --> 00:48:10,160
Right.

804
00:48:10,160 --> 00:48:12,240
Do you remember that time we went to see the Reds game

805
00:48:12,240 --> 00:48:13,520
and it started raining

806
00:48:13,520 --> 00:48:15,840
and everybody else cleared out of the stadium

807
00:48:15,840 --> 00:48:17,040
and we're standing in the hallways

808
00:48:17,040 --> 00:48:18,160
waiting for the rain to blow over

809
00:48:18,160 --> 00:48:18,800
and we were like,

810
00:48:18,800 --> 00:48:20,320
we're going to stay in our seats the whole time

811
00:48:20,320 --> 00:48:21,280
and be cool dudes

812
00:48:21,280 --> 00:48:23,680
and then lightning struck a flagpole

813
00:48:23,680 --> 00:48:25,600
on the opposite side of the ballpark

814
00:48:25,600 --> 00:48:28,560
at which point after sitting in the rain for an hour

815
00:48:28,560 --> 00:48:30,640
then we got up and went and stood in the hallways

816
00:48:30,640 --> 00:48:31,520
with everyone else.

817
00:48:31,520 --> 00:48:31,840
Do you want to be back?

818
00:48:31,840 --> 00:48:32,400
And we left.

819
00:48:32,400 --> 00:48:33,840
We left because we were wet

820
00:48:33,840 --> 00:48:35,200
and then the rain stopped

821
00:48:35,200 --> 00:48:36,800
and everybody else got to enjoy the game.

822
00:48:36,800 --> 00:48:38,240
I think we also stopped at skyline

823
00:48:38,240 --> 00:48:40,720
because we also wanted to shit ourselves on the way home.

824
00:48:40,720 --> 00:48:41,680
We definitely-

825
00:48:42,240 --> 00:48:44,080
One of the best things about going to a Reds game-

826
00:48:44,080 --> 00:48:46,240
So we live three hours away from Cincinnati

827
00:48:46,240 --> 00:48:48,960
in Huntington is three hours away from Cincinnati.

828
00:48:48,960 --> 00:48:51,360
So it would be a day trip, right?

829
00:48:51,360 --> 00:48:51,920
So we would-

830
00:48:52,480 --> 00:48:54,080
So dad would say,

831
00:48:54,080 --> 00:48:55,520
hey boys, let's go.

832
00:48:55,520 --> 00:48:56,480
Sometimes mom would come too

833
00:48:56,480 --> 00:48:58,880
but I remember it being a few times

834
00:48:58,880 --> 00:49:00,880
it was just like the four of us

835
00:49:00,880 --> 00:49:02,960
and it would be like, let's make a day of it.

836
00:49:02,960 --> 00:49:03,840
Go see a Reds game.

837
00:49:03,840 --> 00:49:05,520
So we'd drive up in the morning.

838
00:49:05,520 --> 00:49:06,800
We'd get there, you know

839
00:49:06,800 --> 00:49:08,400
we'd get the mini Reds bat

840
00:49:08,400 --> 00:49:09,760
and we'd watch the game.

841
00:49:09,760 --> 00:49:12,400
Justin would fill out an application for a credit card.

842
00:49:12,400 --> 00:49:14,160
That almost always happened.

843
00:49:14,160 --> 00:49:15,200
I did do that once.

844
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:17,760
Started myself on a road to financial ruin

845
00:49:17,760 --> 00:49:18,880
that I'm still trying to escape from.

846
00:49:18,880 --> 00:49:22,080
I was 16 years old

847
00:49:22,080 --> 00:49:24,640
and I got one to get a free Reds baseball cap.

848
00:49:24,640 --> 00:49:27,120
Hi Justin, they sell those.

849
00:49:27,120 --> 00:49:29,440
Hi dad, you had to co-sign.

850
00:49:29,440 --> 00:49:31,360
Like, fuck everybody.

851
00:49:31,360 --> 00:49:33,280
So that was a great thing.

852
00:49:33,280 --> 00:49:35,120
And then as we would leave the stadium

853
00:49:35,120 --> 00:49:37,520
and I had my like, I can't wait to get a credit card.

854
00:49:37,520 --> 00:49:38,480
I wonder what that's like.

855
00:49:39,200 --> 00:49:42,080
As we're leaving, still on that credit card high

856
00:49:43,040 --> 00:49:45,360
we would always stop at Skyline Chili

857
00:49:45,360 --> 00:49:47,600
and then have a three hour drive home.

858
00:49:47,600 --> 00:49:49,680
It was just like a fart rocket.

859
00:49:49,680 --> 00:49:54,960
It was like, do you want to sous vide yourself in farts?

860
00:49:54,960 --> 00:49:59,280
Do you want to fart a ceviche here in our Toyota Corolla?

861
00:49:59,280 --> 00:50:00,400
Like, let's just do it.

862
00:50:00,400 --> 00:50:02,240
We would get out and we would open the door

863
00:50:02,240 --> 00:50:04,080
so we got home and the outside of the car

864
00:50:04,080 --> 00:50:06,560
would just be like unpainted, tarnished metal.

865
00:50:11,200 --> 00:50:12,720
The Reds game was right.

866
00:50:12,720 --> 00:50:14,320
God, baseball games are so expensive

867
00:50:14,320 --> 00:50:15,920
because you got to get the tickets.

868
00:50:15,920 --> 00:50:17,920
You got to get the kids the souvenirs.

869
00:50:17,920 --> 00:50:21,200
You have to have the seats of the car reupholstered

870
00:50:21,200 --> 00:50:21,840
and then barn.

871
00:50:23,920 --> 00:50:24,640
Oh, farts.

872
00:50:25,440 --> 00:50:26,960
Yeah, that's what the joke is

873
00:50:26,960 --> 00:50:28,560
because the chili would make you fart.

874
00:50:28,560 --> 00:50:29,520
That's what I was saying.

875
00:50:29,520 --> 00:50:29,920
Let's see.

876
00:50:29,920 --> 00:50:31,520
We talked about safety patrol.

877
00:50:31,520 --> 00:50:32,960
We talked about cold showers.

878
00:50:32,960 --> 00:50:33,680
What else is on your list Griffin?

879
00:50:33,680 --> 00:50:35,280
I did get a credit card.

880
00:50:35,280 --> 00:50:37,360
Travis, thank you for reminding me.

881
00:50:37,360 --> 00:50:39,040
The first credit card I ever got

882
00:50:39,040 --> 00:50:42,320
was at a fucking Reds game for a baseball cap.

883
00:50:42,320 --> 00:50:43,120
What was the limit?

884
00:50:43,120 --> 00:50:44,240
Do you remember the credit limit on that?

885
00:50:44,240 --> 00:50:45,440
$16,000.

886
00:50:45,440 --> 00:50:47,680
Okay, at first, no, no bullshit.

887
00:50:48,560 --> 00:50:50,320
At first it was 500.

888
00:50:51,200 --> 00:50:51,920
Okay.

889
00:50:51,920 --> 00:50:52,800
That's good for a kid.

890
00:50:52,800 --> 00:50:55,200
I'd let my 16 year old have a $500 credit card.

891
00:50:55,200 --> 00:50:58,800
And then I got a letter that it had been extended to $6,000.

892
00:51:01,920 --> 00:51:02,720
And I never-

893
00:51:02,720 --> 00:51:06,000
And this is why we had the credit collapse everybody.

894
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:07,200
Yeah, because of Justin.

895
00:51:07,200 --> 00:51:11,200
$6,000 credit cards to 16 year olds.

896
00:51:11,200 --> 00:51:11,760
That's right.

897
00:51:11,760 --> 00:51:14,240
That is higher than my current credit card limit.

898
00:51:14,240 --> 00:51:15,280
That's insane.

899
00:51:15,280 --> 00:51:15,760
You know what?

900
00:51:15,760 --> 00:51:17,600
I can't get a credit card now.

901
00:51:18,560 --> 00:51:19,680
Because of Justin.

902
00:51:19,680 --> 00:51:21,600
Because of how bad Justin goofed up.

903
00:51:23,040 --> 00:51:24,480
$6,000.

904
00:51:24,480 --> 00:51:25,280
What?

905
00:51:25,280 --> 00:51:25,780
$6,000?

906
00:51:26,720 --> 00:51:29,440
You might as well have had a blank check at that point.

907
00:51:29,440 --> 00:51:30,720
That is the movie blank check.

908
00:51:31,440 --> 00:51:33,440
It's red card.

909
00:51:33,440 --> 00:51:34,640
That's insanity.

910
00:51:34,640 --> 00:51:35,360
$6,000.

911
00:51:37,360 --> 00:51:38,160
But you know what?

912
00:51:38,160 --> 00:51:43,440
To be fair, I used that credit card to pay my tuition at Marshall

913
00:51:43,440 --> 00:51:44,560
and I used it to buy books.

914
00:51:45,840 --> 00:51:48,400
Which is what I told Linda at Universal Credit.

915
00:51:48,400 --> 00:51:50,560
You knew when I got that debt consolidation loan.

916
00:51:51,920 --> 00:51:52,880
What's up?

917
00:51:52,880 --> 00:51:57,440
Actually, I used it to buy an electric guitar and lots of Taco Bell.

918
00:51:57,440 --> 00:51:59,840
And tons and tons and tons of hero clicks.

919
00:52:01,680 --> 00:52:02,480
Put it on the card.

920
00:52:02,480 --> 00:52:03,840
I'll never have to pay this back.

921
00:52:03,840 --> 00:52:05,120
That's adult Justin's problem.

922
00:52:05,120 --> 00:52:06,640
I am adult Justin.

923
00:52:06,640 --> 00:52:09,360
Thank you for your waste.

924
00:52:09,360 --> 00:52:11,520
I got a call from a-

925
00:52:13,360 --> 00:52:16,240
There's a lot of bad information out there about credit cards.

926
00:52:16,240 --> 00:52:18,880
I got it in my head.

927
00:52:18,880 --> 00:52:22,480
Okay, so I saw one of those commercials for one of those like,

928
00:52:22,480 --> 00:52:23,680
we'll take care of your debt.

929
00:52:23,680 --> 00:52:24,160
No problem.

930
00:52:24,160 --> 00:52:26,800
We'll talk to the creditors so you don't have to.

931
00:52:26,800 --> 00:52:28,960
And I was like, well, that sounds like really great.

932
00:52:28,960 --> 00:52:32,000
And they're like, we'll get you your thing for pennies on the dollar.

933
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:35,120
And I looked it up.

934
00:52:35,120 --> 00:52:35,760
I googled it.

935
00:52:35,760 --> 00:52:37,280
I was like, what do these companies do?

936
00:52:37,280 --> 00:52:39,520
Because that seems kind of crazy.

937
00:52:39,520 --> 00:52:44,160
And what I basically said is what they tell you is just to basically stop paying.

938
00:52:44,160 --> 00:52:48,560
And then eventually the credit company will get so desperate

939
00:52:48,560 --> 00:52:50,880
that they'll sell the loan to somebody else

940
00:52:50,880 --> 00:52:54,480
and they'll search you out for like less money, right?

941
00:52:54,480 --> 00:52:56,800
Because they just want to get it off the books at that point.

942
00:52:56,800 --> 00:52:57,920
So they'll sell your debt.

943
00:52:57,920 --> 00:53:01,360
And then that person who's a real dick is going to come for you hard,

944
00:53:01,360 --> 00:53:02,560
but for less money.

945
00:53:02,560 --> 00:53:05,040
And I read that and I thought, well, that's what they do.

946
00:53:05,040 --> 00:53:06,880
I could do that right now.

947
00:53:06,880 --> 00:53:08,400
So I just stopped paying it.

948
00:53:10,560 --> 00:53:14,080
In the first fiscally responsible decision I ever made,

949
00:53:14,080 --> 00:53:17,920
I cut out the middleman and just stopped paying my credit card.

950
00:53:17,920 --> 00:53:19,600
Because I realized I was never going to pay it down.

951
00:53:19,600 --> 00:53:20,800
So I'm just going to stop paying it.

952
00:53:20,800 --> 00:53:23,760
It sounds like you also attempted to cut out the upper man.

953
00:53:23,760 --> 00:53:25,520
I cut out the upper man.

954
00:53:25,520 --> 00:53:27,840
Just you, the lower man.

955
00:53:27,840 --> 00:53:30,720
Leaving only me, the lower man, to deal with this.

956
00:53:30,720 --> 00:53:31,840
And I didn't do anything.

957
00:53:31,840 --> 00:53:34,000
And for months it worked fine.

958
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:34,560
Yeah.

959
00:53:34,560 --> 00:53:37,680
And then I got a very angry call from a gentleman

960
00:53:37,680 --> 00:53:39,680
who wanted some money right then.

961
00:53:39,680 --> 00:53:41,200
But that was for your drugs thing.

962
00:53:41,200 --> 00:53:42,000
That was a different thing.

963
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:43,520
That was actually, yeah.

964
00:53:43,520 --> 00:53:46,000
He was collecting taxes on Balls Out United.

965
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:46,800
And then we had an extensive-

966
00:53:46,800 --> 00:53:49,840
Balls Out United, listen to the words that you said.

967
00:53:49,840 --> 00:53:50,880
I can't.

968
00:53:50,880 --> 00:53:53,200
I'm trying to be honest here on our podcast.

969
00:53:53,200 --> 00:53:56,480
I could have gussied it up and maybe made it a cool name.

970
00:53:56,480 --> 00:53:57,520
Speaking of-

971
00:53:57,520 --> 00:53:58,480
Cool Dudes Inc.

972
00:53:59,120 --> 00:54:02,720
Speaking of gussying up and also your Balls Out United phase,

973
00:54:02,720 --> 00:54:04,720
I want to talk to you about those frosted tips.

974
00:54:05,280 --> 00:54:06,240
As long as we're just like-

975
00:54:06,240 --> 00:54:07,120
As long as this is just-

976
00:54:07,120 --> 00:54:08,240
I don't have enough time.

977
00:54:08,240 --> 00:54:12,000
I think as long as we've been doing the Justin McElroy

978
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:14,160
revelation hour, let's just go ahead

979
00:54:14,160 --> 00:54:15,680
and dive deep into those frosted tips.

980
00:54:15,680 --> 00:54:17,280
I'm going to speak for Justin here.

981
00:54:17,840 --> 00:54:20,640
The frosted tips were a mistake, Griffin.

982
00:54:20,640 --> 00:54:22,400
Because you see, his girlfriend at the time

983
00:54:22,400 --> 00:54:23,440
is getting highlights.

984
00:54:23,440 --> 00:54:25,680
He was there at the salon with her.

985
00:54:25,680 --> 00:54:26,240
What's that?

986
00:54:26,240 --> 00:54:30,160
They had a little bit of leftover, you know, frosting dye.

987
00:54:30,160 --> 00:54:32,000
And he said, well, I can't remember-

988
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:33,600
Oh my god.

989
00:54:33,600 --> 00:54:36,560
Did someone ask you or did you volunteer?

990
00:54:36,560 --> 00:54:37,840
It's been lost to time.

991
00:54:37,840 --> 00:54:38,560
Been lost to time.

992
00:54:38,560 --> 00:54:39,680
No one will ever know.

993
00:54:39,680 --> 00:54:42,800
Okay, so he volunteered that he wanted-

994
00:54:42,800 --> 00:54:44,880
He was like, oh, give me some tips.

995
00:54:44,880 --> 00:54:47,360
Like Justin Timberlake.

996
00:54:47,360 --> 00:54:49,040
And they're like, you want to get a little bit more-

997
00:54:49,040 --> 00:54:51,440
Hey, hey, my name's also Justin.

998
00:54:52,240 --> 00:54:53,680
This sounds good to me.

999
00:54:53,680 --> 00:54:56,080
And then so what they did was they put,

1000
00:54:56,640 --> 00:55:00,800
I would say like 26 very defined points

1001
00:55:00,800 --> 00:55:02,240
of frosted color in his hair.

1002
00:55:03,200 --> 00:55:04,720
If I remember correctly.

1003
00:55:04,720 --> 00:55:06,560
It looked very good.

1004
00:55:08,880 --> 00:55:12,320
Do you know that I had a phase before the frosted tips phase

1005
00:55:12,320 --> 00:55:14,720
where, you know, the, oh my god.

1006
00:55:14,720 --> 00:55:15,920
I can't believe I'm gonna say this.

1007
00:55:15,920 --> 00:55:17,760
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.

1008
00:55:18,320 --> 00:55:20,160
Oh god, this is a rough one.

1009
00:55:20,160 --> 00:55:20,800
Okay, hold on.

1010
00:55:23,520 --> 00:55:27,440
Rougher than you getting couple's frosted tips?

1011
00:55:27,440 --> 00:55:30,160
That's worse than I ever could have imagined.

1012
00:55:30,160 --> 00:55:31,760
It's rougher than that.

1013
00:55:31,760 --> 00:55:36,320
You know those cans of hairspray that you use around Halloween

1014
00:55:36,880 --> 00:55:40,080
to color your hair a certain color just as a goof?

1015
00:55:40,080 --> 00:55:40,640
Yeah.

1016
00:55:40,640 --> 00:55:44,400
I had a period for about two weeks in high school

1017
00:55:44,400 --> 00:55:48,960
where I was spraying some of that blonde spray

1018
00:55:49,600 --> 00:55:53,120
into my hair to give myself a different look,

1019
00:55:53,120 --> 00:55:54,720
a different blonder look.

1020
00:55:54,720 --> 00:55:57,920
It fucked my hair up so bad

1021
00:55:57,920 --> 00:56:00,560
because it is not meant to be a daily application.

1022
00:56:01,360 --> 00:56:02,880
He used it how much?

1023
00:56:02,880 --> 00:56:04,640
Get him to the doctor.

1024
00:56:04,640 --> 00:56:06,800
Yeah, go to the hair doctor right now.

1025
00:56:06,800 --> 00:56:08,480
Justin, Justin.

1026
00:56:08,480 --> 00:56:10,320
Griffin.

1027
00:56:10,320 --> 00:56:13,920
Last year, you had a beautiful baby girl.

1028
00:56:13,920 --> 00:56:16,080
You and Sydney had a beautiful baby girl, Charlie.

1029
00:56:16,080 --> 00:56:17,760
She's a wonderful child.

1030
00:56:17,760 --> 00:56:18,480
I'm a fan.

1031
00:56:18,480 --> 00:56:19,680
It's, I am too.

1032
00:56:19,680 --> 00:56:21,440
I like her new stuff and her old stuff.

1033
00:56:21,440 --> 00:56:22,240
The whole catalog.

1034
00:56:22,800 --> 00:56:26,800
It is a miracle that you were able to produce her

1035
00:56:27,440 --> 00:56:30,000
that this ritual that you just described

1036
00:56:30,640 --> 00:56:34,240
did not burn and salt your dick completely clean off.

1037
00:56:36,880 --> 00:56:37,680
Thank you, Griffin.

1038
00:56:37,680 --> 00:56:38,880
I was pretty excited.

1039
00:56:38,880 --> 00:56:39,920
I'm excited for you.

1040
00:56:39,920 --> 00:56:42,960
Now that I know this, that's a miracle child.

1041
00:56:42,960 --> 00:56:44,240
Oh, what a miracle baby.

1042
00:56:44,240 --> 00:56:47,360
I'm going to try and canonize her for sainthood

1043
00:56:47,360 --> 00:56:48,800
because she should not exist.

1044
00:56:48,800 --> 00:56:50,240
And Justin, can you tell me,

1045
00:56:50,240 --> 00:56:53,440
did you do all of these hair shenanigans

1046
00:56:53,440 --> 00:56:55,280
before or after the credit card?

1047
00:56:55,840 --> 00:56:58,960
I'm just trying to develop a timeline of times

1048
00:56:58,960 --> 00:57:00,000
I could have stopped you.

1049
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:01,840
Yeah, Travis, I see where you're getting at.

1050
00:57:01,840 --> 00:57:05,920
I think that once I did have a net worth

1051
00:57:05,920 --> 00:57:08,640
of roughly six thousand dollars,

1052
00:57:08,640 --> 00:57:10,720
I felt like I had to live up to that lifestyle.

1053
00:57:10,720 --> 00:57:11,600
You know what I mean?

1054
00:57:11,600 --> 00:57:13,520
I couldn't just roll into the hottest clubs

1055
00:57:13,520 --> 00:57:17,360
with my brown, boring, plain Jane hair.

1056
00:57:17,360 --> 00:57:20,720
I had to go in with a three dollar can of costume shop

1057
00:57:20,720 --> 00:57:24,480
blonde spray on my locks.

1058
00:57:24,480 --> 00:57:26,480
The money really changed you.

1059
00:57:26,480 --> 00:57:28,800
This has been a rough episode for you, Justin.

1060
00:57:29,520 --> 00:57:31,280
I mean, I didn't come out of it looking great

1061
00:57:31,280 --> 00:57:32,400
if that's what you're getting at.

1062
00:57:32,400 --> 00:57:33,840
Maybe you should get some blonde tips.

1063
00:57:33,840 --> 00:57:37,680
Well, Travis, I've kind of been down that road.

1064
00:57:37,680 --> 00:57:39,360
Have you ever thought about shaving your head

1065
00:57:39,360 --> 00:57:41,840
into like some kind of a monk's tonsure?

1066
00:57:41,840 --> 00:57:45,040
God, yes, yes, yes, Justin, Justin,

1067
00:57:45,040 --> 00:57:48,160
you have lived such a wonderful, wonderful life.

1068
00:57:48,160 --> 00:57:52,320
I did do that, but that was for a show.

1069
00:57:52,320 --> 00:57:53,920
And that was actually laziness

1070
00:57:53,920 --> 00:57:56,480
because I couldn't commit to putting a skull cap on every night.

1071
00:57:56,480 --> 00:57:58,960
I was Friar Lawrence and Romeo and Juliet

1072
00:57:58,960 --> 00:58:01,440
and I had to get, I shaved a tonsure in there.

1073
00:58:01,440 --> 00:58:04,880
And then the worst part was that I,

1074
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:08,000
if you shave a tonsure into your head,

1075
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:10,240
the hair is never gonna catch up.

1076
00:58:10,240 --> 00:58:11,440
It doesn't work that way.

1077
00:58:11,440 --> 00:58:13,440
You'll always end up with a donut.

1078
00:58:13,440 --> 00:58:15,440
Yeah, exactly, like a perma donut.

1079
00:58:15,440 --> 00:58:18,000
So I was like, well, I've gotta shave it off.

1080
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:21,200
And let me tell you, bald Justin is a look.

1081
00:58:22,480 --> 00:58:24,160
The best way I can describe it is

1082
00:58:24,880 --> 00:58:30,240
if Uncle Fester and Pugsley had a baby, that was me.

1083
00:58:30,240 --> 00:58:33,520
I had like the fat stubby Pugsley body,

1084
00:58:33,520 --> 00:58:35,840
but the Uncle Fester head.

1085
00:58:35,840 --> 00:58:37,920
Uncle Pugster was Justin.

1086
00:58:37,920 --> 00:58:39,360
Uncle Pugster was me.

1087
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:41,360
Oh man.

1088
00:58:41,360 --> 00:58:44,000
Did you guys have anything you wanna like get off your chest?

1089
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:45,920
I haven't done anything even,

1090
00:58:47,520 --> 00:58:49,680
the tamest thing that you've said so far

1091
00:58:49,680 --> 00:58:51,040
is worse than my worst thing.

1092
00:58:51,760 --> 00:58:54,320
I think I had a rat tail when I was like seven.

1093
00:58:54,320 --> 00:58:55,520
But that's fine, you're seven.

1094
00:58:55,520 --> 00:58:55,680
I was seven.

1095
00:58:55,680 --> 00:58:57,440
You can do anything when you're seven.

1096
00:58:57,440 --> 00:58:58,880
I did all this for you guys.

1097
00:58:58,880 --> 00:59:01,440
I fjorded the path for you

1098
00:59:02,240 --> 00:59:05,440
so you wouldn't have to make these same mistakes.

1099
00:59:05,440 --> 00:59:08,560
Oh, I will also say this towards my minkusing.

1100
00:59:08,560 --> 00:59:12,320
For high school, my junior homecoming,

1101
00:59:13,200 --> 00:59:16,480
I wanted to have my hair like Sean from Boy Meets World.

1102
00:59:17,040 --> 00:59:19,760
So I parted it down the middle, grew it out.

1103
00:59:19,760 --> 00:59:21,120
Mission accomplished, by the way.

1104
00:59:21,120 --> 00:59:22,800
Did not look like Sean from Boy Meets World.

1105
00:59:22,800 --> 00:59:27,360
But I did wear a leather jacket to homecoming

1106
00:59:27,360 --> 00:59:30,160
and in all of my pictures.

1107
00:59:30,800 --> 00:59:31,760
God, that's good.

1108
00:59:31,760 --> 00:59:32,800
Yeah, that's really good.

1109
00:59:32,800 --> 00:59:34,080
That was a solid moment.

1110
00:59:34,080 --> 00:59:35,920
I think I still have that somewhere.

1111
00:59:35,920 --> 00:59:37,600
I, when I was in high school,

1112
00:59:38,880 --> 00:59:40,560
my girlfriend went to get highlights.

1113
00:59:40,560 --> 00:59:42,240
So I said, let me just get some of that extra goo

1114
00:59:42,240 --> 00:59:43,600
and put it right up in my stuff

1115
00:59:43,600 --> 00:59:45,280
and then we'll get matching hair color.

1116
00:59:46,160 --> 00:59:48,960
Oh, I got confused.

1117
00:59:48,960 --> 00:59:50,800
I didn't think you licensed that one.

1118
00:59:51,840 --> 00:59:54,960
I think you repurposed that from my life story.

1119
00:59:54,960 --> 00:59:56,160
I have another embarrassing one.

1120
00:59:56,160 --> 00:59:58,640
I'll just trot this out real quick.

1121
00:59:58,640 --> 01:00:00,640
As long as we're just like leaving it all in the court.

1122
01:00:01,680 --> 01:00:03,680
When I was in my freshman year of college,

1123
01:00:03,680 --> 01:00:06,160
the same girlfriend who I got frosted tips with,

1124
01:00:06,880 --> 01:00:08,800
I wanted to surprise her for her birthday.

1125
01:00:09,600 --> 01:00:12,000
And I, oh boy.

1126
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:14,480
And I wanted to do something

1127
01:00:14,480 --> 01:00:16,800
that she had talked about for a long time,

1128
01:00:16,800 --> 01:00:19,440
but I thought just never had the courage to do.

1129
01:00:19,440 --> 01:00:21,840
I am terrified right now.

1130
01:00:22,800 --> 01:00:25,520
I'm legitimately moving away from my computer and microphone.

1131
01:00:25,520 --> 01:00:27,120
Don't move it, just hang there with me.

1132
01:00:31,040 --> 01:00:32,320
Okay, I'm just gonna commit.

1133
01:00:32,320 --> 01:00:33,680
I'm just gonna go for it.

1134
01:00:33,680 --> 01:00:35,680
So I've made her put on a blindfold

1135
01:00:36,480 --> 01:00:41,760
and I drove her to Davidson's Music,

1136
01:00:42,480 --> 01:00:46,880
which was a combination CD store and piercing place.

1137
01:00:46,880 --> 01:00:48,320
And I brought her in the front door,

1138
01:00:48,320 --> 01:00:51,040
removed the blindfold and said,

1139
01:00:52,800 --> 01:00:53,680
this is my girlfriend

1140
01:00:53,680 --> 01:00:56,400
and she would like to get her belly button pierced please.

1141
01:00:57,040 --> 01:01:00,400
Because she had talked about it for so long.

1142
01:01:00,400 --> 01:01:03,840
She left a girlfriend shaped dust cloud

1143
01:01:03,840 --> 01:01:06,320
as she vacated the premises.

1144
01:01:06,320 --> 01:01:09,280
That is the craziest thing I've ever.

1145
01:01:09,280 --> 01:01:12,800
That is, that is no, no, no.

1146
01:01:12,800 --> 01:01:14,880
That's something a serial killer does.

1147
01:01:17,200 --> 01:01:19,120
I thought it was a grand gesture.

1148
01:01:19,680 --> 01:01:20,800
Okay, appropriately enough,

1149
01:01:20,800 --> 01:01:22,160
you were doing it to a high school girl,

1150
01:01:22,160 --> 01:01:24,320
which is what a serial killer would also,

1151
01:01:24,320 --> 01:01:26,160
that's all they intend to tell you.

1152
01:01:26,160 --> 01:01:28,080
If you had said, this is my girlfriend,

1153
01:01:28,080 --> 01:01:29,280
I'm going to murder her.

1154
01:01:29,840 --> 01:01:30,480
I'm not kidding.

1155
01:01:30,480 --> 01:01:32,000
Everything about the blindfold,

1156
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:34,640
the dual purpose establishment where you took her,

1157
01:01:34,640 --> 01:01:36,480
the surprise piercing,

1158
01:01:36,480 --> 01:01:38,880
all of these things combined are a serial killer.

1159
01:01:38,880 --> 01:01:40,240
If it wasn't you telling me this,

1160
01:01:40,240 --> 01:01:42,800
I would be calling the fucking police right now.

1161
01:01:42,800 --> 01:01:47,040
That's the craziest thing I've ever heard.

1162
01:01:47,040 --> 01:01:50,080
Happy birthday, here's a hole.

1163
01:01:50,080 --> 01:01:51,360
I'm going to put a hole in you.

1164
01:01:51,360 --> 01:01:52,880
Happy birthday, I'm going to put a hole.

1165
01:01:52,880 --> 01:01:55,920
This stranger CD, this used CD salesman

1166
01:01:55,920 --> 01:01:56,960
is going to put a hole in you

1167
01:01:56,960 --> 01:01:58,720
like there's a hole in all his CDs.

1168
01:01:58,720 --> 01:02:01,040
While I look at this hooting the blowfish album,

1169
01:02:01,040 --> 01:02:03,200
I consider whether or not to buy a second copy.

1170
01:02:04,720 --> 01:02:07,200
I, she had talked about it for a while.

1171
01:02:07,200 --> 01:02:10,400
So I just thought that she wanted it done.

1172
01:02:10,400 --> 01:02:14,880
Put by a stranger and on a surprise date and time.

1173
01:02:14,880 --> 01:02:17,440
Put by a stranger and on a surprise date and time.

1174
01:02:17,440 --> 01:02:18,240
We're not together.

1175
01:02:22,240 --> 01:02:22,960
Didn't work out.

1176
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:26,240
Can we end the episode now?

1177
01:02:26,240 --> 01:02:26,560
Yes.

1178
01:02:26,560 --> 01:02:27,360
Yeah, sure.

1179
01:02:27,360 --> 01:02:29,200
I can't think of a better,

1180
01:02:29,200 --> 01:02:31,360
more uplifting way for me to walk away

1181
01:02:31,360 --> 01:02:33,280
from the flaming wreckage of my life.

1182
01:02:33,280 --> 01:02:34,320
So that's in digital.

1183
01:02:34,320 --> 01:02:35,760
I mean, this is digitally archived now.

1184
01:02:35,760 --> 01:02:35,920
Yeah.

1185
01:02:35,920 --> 01:02:36,720
This is in the cloud.

1186
01:02:36,720 --> 01:02:37,200
This is in a library.

1187
01:02:37,200 --> 01:02:38,800
I can't get any of these memories back.

1188
01:02:39,760 --> 01:02:42,720
Listen, next week advice, I promise.

1189
01:02:42,720 --> 01:02:44,560
This is a Griffin McElroy D&T.

1190
01:02:44,560 --> 01:02:45,760
Yeah, well, we had advice.

1191
01:02:45,760 --> 01:02:47,280
It's just reverse advice this time.

1192
01:02:47,280 --> 01:02:49,040
Just don't do anything that we've talked about

1193
01:02:49,040 --> 01:02:50,080
the second half of this program.

1194
01:02:50,080 --> 01:02:51,440
You will be aces.

1195
01:02:52,080 --> 01:02:53,360
I mean, don't do anything we've talked about

1196
01:02:53,360 --> 01:02:55,120
for the last 259 episodes.

1197
01:02:55,840 --> 01:02:56,560
Right, but still.

1198
01:02:58,080 --> 01:03:00,080
Okay, we really need to start the episode now.

1199
01:03:00,080 --> 01:03:00,640
Here we go.

1200
01:03:00,640 --> 01:03:00,880
All right.

1201
01:03:01,520 --> 01:03:02,240
All right.

1202
01:03:02,240 --> 01:03:03,440
I'm Justin McElroy.

1203
01:03:03,440 --> 01:03:04,560
A lot of people have been asking,

1204
01:03:05,440 --> 01:03:07,520
speaking of when we're going to start,

1205
01:03:07,520 --> 01:03:10,240
the Totino's thing, 100% true.

1206
01:03:10,240 --> 01:03:11,120
We're doing that.

1207
01:03:11,120 --> 01:03:12,160
That's a real thing.

1208
01:03:12,160 --> 01:03:14,560
Hashtag NBNBAM Totino's.

1209
01:03:14,560 --> 01:03:17,040
We have gotten so many awesome already.

1210
01:03:17,040 --> 01:03:19,760
I would say at least 35 usable questions

1211
01:03:20,320 --> 01:03:21,760
for the Totino's episode.

1212
01:03:22,880 --> 01:03:24,080
It's very exciting.

1213
01:03:24,080 --> 01:03:27,360
We've gotten hundreds of Totino's flavored Yahoos,

1214
01:03:27,360 --> 01:03:29,760
which I'm very, very excited to dig into.

1215
01:03:29,760 --> 01:03:31,360
What date is that episode going to be on again?

1216
01:03:31,360 --> 01:03:34,000
It's going to be July 22nd, I believe.

1217
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:34,400
Awesome.

1218
01:03:34,400 --> 01:03:35,760
And that's a bonus, by the way.

1219
01:03:35,760 --> 01:03:38,480
Like we're not, this is not like the new direction

1220
01:03:38,480 --> 01:03:41,920
of my brother and me is like sponsored episode.

1221
01:03:41,920 --> 01:03:44,080
No, we'll put that up in the middle of the week,

1222
01:03:44,080 --> 01:03:46,080
or is it going to go up also on Monday?

1223
01:03:46,080 --> 01:03:48,400
It goes up on Wednesday.

1224
01:03:48,400 --> 01:03:49,440
What else do you want to talk about?

1225
01:03:49,440 --> 01:03:51,920
The Midwest or the Pacific Northwest shows?

1226
01:03:51,920 --> 01:03:52,240
Yes.

1227
01:03:53,840 --> 01:03:55,200
Well, we've got three shows coming up,

1228
01:03:55,200 --> 01:03:57,280
but we've got two with tickets still available.

1229
01:03:57,840 --> 01:04:00,960
We're doing shows August 28th, 29th, 30th.

1230
01:04:00,960 --> 01:04:02,720
On the 29th, we're going to be in Seattle.

1231
01:04:03,600 --> 01:04:05,760
On the 30th, we're going to be in Vancouver.

1232
01:04:05,760 --> 01:04:07,680
Tickets are still available for both of those.

1233
01:04:07,680 --> 01:04:08,960
On the 28th, we're going to be in Portland,

1234
01:04:08,960 --> 01:04:10,320
but that one's sold out.

1235
01:04:10,320 --> 01:04:14,240
If you go to bit.ly forward slash M-B-M-B-A-M Seattle

1236
01:04:14,240 --> 01:04:18,480
and bit.ly forward slash V-A-N-M-B-M-B-A-M,

1237
01:04:18,480 --> 01:04:19,600
you can find those tickets.

1238
01:04:19,600 --> 01:04:20,640
It's assigned seating.

1239
01:04:20,640 --> 01:04:24,080
So the longer you wait, the less good your seats will be.

1240
01:04:24,880 --> 01:04:27,360
And they're selling, they're selling.

1241
01:04:27,360 --> 01:04:29,520
There are a lot of seats that are gone.

1242
01:04:29,520 --> 01:04:31,120
There are still plenty of good seats available

1243
01:04:31,920 --> 01:04:34,960
and make sure you don't, which sounds like a line,

1244
01:04:34,960 --> 01:04:35,520
but really isn't.

1245
01:04:35,520 --> 01:04:37,280
Yeah, I would not be surprised if they're sold out before.

1246
01:04:37,280 --> 01:04:39,520
But don't wait much longer.

1247
01:04:39,520 --> 01:04:40,720
Yeah.

1248
01:04:40,720 --> 01:04:41,440
I hope.

1249
01:04:41,440 --> 01:04:42,560
God, I hope so.

1250
01:04:42,560 --> 01:04:46,080
And if you are going to be attending those shows,

1251
01:04:46,080 --> 01:04:48,240
go ahead and start sending us questions now.

1252
01:04:48,240 --> 01:04:50,320
Make sure you put either Portland, Seattle,

1253
01:04:50,320 --> 01:04:51,760
or Vancouver in the subject line,

1254
01:04:51,760 --> 01:04:53,280
depending on which one you're going to be at.

1255
01:04:55,200 --> 01:04:59,040
And just, we'll also probably do live audience questions.

1256
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:01,280
Or maybe no advice at all.

1257
01:05:01,280 --> 01:05:03,520
Maybe we'll just talk about our jobs

1258
01:05:03,520 --> 01:05:05,360
and the horrible, horrible things we did

1259
01:05:05,360 --> 01:05:06,800
for our high school girlfriend.

1260
01:05:06,800 --> 01:05:07,520
Yes.

1261
01:05:07,520 --> 01:05:09,120
I want to thank John Roderick and the Longwinters

1262
01:05:09,120 --> 01:05:09,920
for the use of our theme song.

1263
01:05:09,920 --> 01:05:12,000
It's a departure off the album, Pointing the Days to Bed.

1264
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:12,720
It's a great album.

1265
01:05:13,360 --> 01:05:15,600
I've been listening to my old mixtapes

1266
01:05:15,600 --> 01:05:17,440
from when I had my college radio show

1267
01:05:17,440 --> 01:05:20,000
and there's a lot of Longwinters on there.

1268
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:24,480
So it's a good music option for any time of life.

1269
01:05:25,280 --> 01:05:25,840
Well put.

1270
01:05:26,720 --> 01:05:29,760
We've also made some updates and some changes

1271
01:05:29,760 --> 01:05:32,400
to our YouTube page so that it's a little bit easier

1272
01:05:32,400 --> 01:05:37,840
to navigate if you go to youtube.com slash mbmbam.

1273
01:05:37,840 --> 01:05:39,760
We have lots of animated shorts.

1274
01:05:39,760 --> 01:05:42,160
We have a couple of live show clips.

1275
01:05:42,160 --> 01:05:42,960
So go check it out.

1276
01:05:42,960 --> 01:05:45,440
Go listen to all the other amazing Max Fon podcasts.

1277
01:05:46,240 --> 01:05:49,200
There's far too many to mention, but they're all incredible.

1278
01:05:49,200 --> 01:05:50,240
I highly recommend them.

1279
01:05:50,240 --> 01:05:52,240
Go check out Things I Bought at Sheets,

1280
01:05:52,240 --> 01:05:54,640
Justin's hit YouTube video series.

1281
01:05:54,640 --> 01:05:56,880
And go listen to trends like these.

1282
01:05:56,880 --> 01:06:00,400
That's a new show that Travis does with his buddy Brent.

1283
01:06:00,400 --> 01:06:03,760
They talk about internet trends and important buzzwords.

1284
01:06:04,480 --> 01:06:05,360
And it's really great.

1285
01:06:05,360 --> 01:06:06,480
Go check that out.

1286
01:06:06,480 --> 01:06:07,280
Go check that out.

1287
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:09,920
Instead of a Yahoo, a final Yahoo,

1288
01:06:09,920 --> 01:06:11,280
that certainly wouldn't be appropriate,

1289
01:06:12,400 --> 01:06:14,720
I'm trying to think of something embarrassing about me

1290
01:06:14,720 --> 01:06:15,440
that I can tell.

1291
01:06:15,440 --> 01:06:16,800
I really am having a hard time placing.

1292
01:06:16,800 --> 01:06:17,920
You know what I wish we could find?

1293
01:06:17,920 --> 01:06:20,000
It's one of the Boy Detective recordings.

1294
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:23,680
Oh my god, Justin and I were in a band called Boy Detective.

1295
01:06:23,680 --> 01:06:24,800
And it was the greatest band ever.

1296
01:06:24,800 --> 01:06:26,240
See, I'm not even embarrassed about that.

1297
01:06:26,240 --> 01:06:27,520
I just haven't done one yet.

1298
01:06:27,520 --> 01:06:31,840
And my life can't be completely devoid of embarrassing moments.

1299
01:06:31,840 --> 01:06:35,200
When I was in high school, we had to do lip syncs

1300
01:06:35,200 --> 01:06:41,200
and my song that I chose to lip sync was Sweet Home Alabama.

1301
01:06:41,200 --> 01:06:44,080
And I wore a flannel shirt and had a hobo bend

1302
01:06:44,080 --> 01:06:44,880
all over my shoulder.

1303
01:06:45,600 --> 01:06:48,000
And I just spent the entire song walking back and forth

1304
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:50,240
on the stage, mouthing the lyrics.

1305
01:06:50,240 --> 01:06:53,440
And with my thumb out, I just walked back and forth,

1306
01:06:53,440 --> 01:06:56,000
mouthing the entire, like lip syncing the entirety

1307
01:06:56,000 --> 01:06:57,280
of Sweet Home Alabama.

1308
01:06:57,280 --> 01:06:59,360
I mean, Griffin and I also did Walk the Dinosaur

1309
01:06:59,360 --> 01:07:00,240
where he played the dinosaur.

1310
01:07:00,240 --> 01:07:01,120
But that was adorable.

1311
01:07:01,120 --> 01:07:02,160
He was fucking adorable.

1312
01:07:02,160 --> 01:07:03,600
And we won second place too.

1313
01:07:03,600 --> 01:07:05,360
So like, yeah.

1314
01:07:05,360 --> 01:07:07,200
I don't think anything bad has happened.

1315
01:07:07,200 --> 01:07:10,160
When I was in seventh grade, our final project

1316
01:07:10,160 --> 01:07:12,320
for English class was we had to write a book.

1317
01:07:12,320 --> 01:07:16,720
And I did write my own sort of like Tales

1318
01:07:16,720 --> 01:07:19,760
from the Mos Eisley Cantina sort of extended universe

1319
01:07:19,760 --> 01:07:21,600
Pokemon story that I had to read aloud

1320
01:07:21,600 --> 01:07:23,440
in front of the entire class.

1321
01:07:23,440 --> 01:07:26,720
And then later that day, Jack Hoover speared me into the mud

1322
01:07:26,720 --> 01:07:37,520
and ruined my only copy of the transcript.

1323
01:07:37,520 --> 01:07:39,360
I knew there was something Pokemon related,

1324
01:07:39,360 --> 01:07:42,240
but I forgot that I had penned my own sort of masterpiece.

1325
01:07:44,320 --> 01:07:45,440
We're all disasters.

1326
01:07:46,160 --> 01:07:46,960
I'm okay now.

1327
01:07:46,960 --> 01:07:48,640
Because now I get paid to write about Pokemon.

1328
01:07:48,640 --> 01:07:49,360
Fuck the haters.

1329
01:07:49,360 --> 01:07:56,160
Fuck the haters, and kiss your dad's square in the lips.

1330
01:07:56,160 --> 01:08:11,360
Hey, girls, do you want to say, hey, I want to?

1341
01:08:30,720 --> 01:08:32,720
that we've tried to fix each other over the years.

1342

You know, some light summer listening.

1343
01:08:34,880 --> 01:08:36,880
Maybe you want to hear about yogurt enemas,

1344
01:08:36,880 --> 01:08:39,520
or why we tried to eat mummies for a while,

1345
01:08:39,520 --> 01:08:43,040
or why drinking cholera diarrhea sounded like a good idea.

1346
01:08:43,040 --> 01:08:46,320
That and so much more is waiting for you every Tuesday

1347
01:08:46,320 --> 01:08:50,160
right here on the Maximum Fun Network with Sawbones,

1348
