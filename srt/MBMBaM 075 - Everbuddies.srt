1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:30,800
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:46,720 --> 00:00:52,400
You've got 55 minutes to record this episode before Justin has to leave and go hang out with

6
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:57,040
his in-laws. At the- where am I going? Did you guess the West Virginia Pumpkin Festival? Because

7
00:00:57,040 --> 00:01:01,760
that's the fuck exactly where I'm going. That is exactly the fucking pumpkin festival destination

8
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:07,200
that he is attending. Did you- do you think I will see the biggest pumpkin in the country?

9
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:11,920
No, it's not a national pumpkin festival, but I will see the biggest in the state, and that's-

10
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:17,840
that ain't- that ain't- ain't too shabby. Ain't too shabby. Tony Almeida, hand me that gun,

11
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:23,840
I have to shoot this pumpkin. Boop. Welcome to our Pumpkin Slash 24 Tribute episode,

12
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:28,960
episode 75, My Brother, My Brother, Me, an advice show for the modern era. I'm your oldest brother,

13
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:34,320
Justin McElroy. I'm your sleepiest brother, Travis McElroy. I'm your sickest brother, Griffin. Guys,

14
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:40,400
54 minutes, let's cram some fucking comedy into this shit. I work in a law firm, and I just

15
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:46,080
received an all-office email inviting me to my workplace's first ever Rockin' Halloween Bash.

16
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:52,960
Let me try that one. Let me try that one more time. Rockin' Halloween Bash. My office has thrown

17
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:58,400
some memorably awkward parties in the past, but this one by far promises to be the worst.

18
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:05,440
We've been told we need to dress up, and there's a special award waiting for the least enthusiastic

19
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:12,960
party attendee. Oh god, this is a recipe for success. But my already planned Halloween costume

20
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:19,600
is definitely not office appropriate. I need some suggestions for quick, inexpensive costume

21
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:25,360
that I'll pass the muster at this godawful party and help me avoid being pinned as the office party

22
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:33,040
pupa. I'm a lady in my mid-20s, if that helps narrow down the ideas at all. Well, she definitely

23
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:40,240
doesn't want to be the party pupa. Yeah, no. Or the party koopa. Get out of here, crazy shell.

24
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:45,680
Folks, when you ask a question like this, you gotta tell us what celebrity you most resemble,

25
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:50,720
because otherwise I can't picture in my head. I can't tell you a good costume. Let's start off by,

26
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:55,120
what do you think that inappropriate costume is? What do you think she's going as? I think it's

27
00:02:55,120 --> 00:03:01,040
somebody humping an animal. Have you seen? What? You think she's just gonna walk around with an

28
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:05,280
animal around her like on a belt that she's gonna be like, get it? I'm fucking this dog.

29
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:11,360
That's my costume. It's probably that, it's probably that kid, that lady that John under

30
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:17,760
baby. That's not appropriate. Damn it. I thought of that costume idea and I thought it would be

31
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:22,480
so clever. And apparently I keep thinking of clever things like, but they're not clever.

32
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:27,040
Everyone thought of them first. What about this? This occurred to me in, in listening to the

33
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:31,600
question. Do you have an, a buddy at your office, like a good friend that you really trust? Cause

34
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:37,120
if so, give him a micro recorder, uh, with your voice on it and go as an invisible person.

35
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:45,120
Um, and then you just go Travis. That's brilliant. Yeah. That's really good. A lot of, a lot of

36
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:52,240
hard work to sync up that audio, but we need what you need is a webcam with some sort of three G

37
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:59,280
dongle where you can watch the action and respond appropriately to your process. Racist jokes.

38
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:08,080
Um, here's, here's a, here's a cheap costume idea. Easy to do that. Uh, my, my friends in college and

39
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:13,600
I have did on occasion was when we would need a last minute costumes to go to like a Halloween

40
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:20,160
party or whatever, we were all broken and, and, uh, nobody prepared for anything. So we would,

41
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:25,600
uh, all switch clothes and come as each other. I like it. It's a, you mix it up a little bit.

42
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:29,680
You try, you know, as, as much as you're, cause people at the office will get a kick out of that.

43
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:35,760
I'm Gary. Do you get it? Like I'm dressed like Gary. I'm Gary. Gary would have to wear some

44
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:40,720
pretty distinctive garb though, wouldn't he? It would have to be like Gary's ducky tie,

45
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:45,840
Gary's cummerbund that he always wears. Man, Gary's a fucking monster. And that's going to

46
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:50,960
be horrifying. You need to cut off Gary's whole face. I live inside Gary now.

47
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:58,800
Could I go as Dilbert or is that like too meta? Holy shit. Office Halloween party.

48
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:05,280
Can you go as sexy Dilbert? I'm slutty Dilbert. I'm sorry. Do you, do you mean Dilbert?

49
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:13,280
The way that tie curves up. Don't mind if I do those tufts that his no nose and very,

50
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:19,120
very underspoken mouth. Lack of pupils. I dig that. I'm into that today. His ambiguous shape.

51
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:24,720
Yeah. It's like a, it's like a, uh, some sort of squash, like a spaghetti squash.

52
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:31,680
I'd love me a bulbous, noseless fictional character. People at offices love, oh my God,

53
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:37,520
you know, you should go as Kathy. People in offices love Kathy. They put a, put a Kathy

54
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:44,320
comic up a Ziggy. They love that. You could just go as office supplies and sitting at your desk,

55
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:49,120
just start attaching stuff to your clothes. And it's like, I'm the office supply cabinet.

56
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:54,000
I'm, I'm Rachel from accounting that used to steal things all the time. Hey, uh, Katie,

57
00:05:54,000 --> 00:06:00,000
I'm going to take this a step back. I'm going to, um, I'm going to shake this dream and bounce up

58
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:04,960
a level and say, don't go to something called the rock and Halloween bash. Just like life rule.

59
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:11,200
Unless Dick Clark is going to, unless they're going to wheel out Dick Clark's fucking cryo chamber.

60
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:14,640
That's a hell of a zombie costume. I'm actually Dick Clark.

61
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:17,680
There's nothing they can threaten you with. Cause what are they going to do? Fire you?

62
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:21,520
Cause that's going to be an awkward lawsuit afterwards. Like why did they fire you?

63
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:27,120
Because I wouldn't go to the rocking Halloween. Here's the thing you guys,

64
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:32,560
I've never worked in an office before, but I have watched every episode of the U S office

65
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:38,880
and parties like these is when you find your true love. Yeah, right. So maybe you should go

66
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:44,800
Katie and meet that special, special someone. You'll go and you'll meet Mary Steenburgen.

67
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:48,160
She'll be the one that you've been meant to be with your whole life.

68
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:52,480
And now you make a special connection and Oscar will be there

69
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:59,600
from the show, the office. And Kevin's always getting into some Kevin, Kevin. What's he doing

70
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:08,560
with those M and M's get out of here. Crazy kook hubby, uh, Griffin, you want to Yahoo?

71
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:14,480
You know, I do. I got a few of those. I saw some people on Twitter blowing you up.

72
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:19,600
They blew my shit right up with the answers. You said, can I get dozens of them? And they

73
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:24,800
literally gave me dozens. Baker's Ian follows close BC Evans, blowing you up.

74
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:30,160
Uh, this one was sent in by frequent contributor Gali Ayali. Thank you, Gali. It's by Yahoo

75
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:35,520
answers user Emily, who asks, is it illegal to go to class in a high school? You don't go to,

76
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:40,800
I am homeschooled and recently went to class in my local high school just to see if anyone noticed

77
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:47,520
they didn't in North Carolina, U S by the way, uh, additional details. I live in a town with

78
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:53,280
200 population. Everybody, my age knows me anyway. I've been in public schools before. I was just

79
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:59,920
curious if they would notice or not. I think a better question is, uh, why didn't her parent

80
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:04,880
teacher notice? Like imagine that homeschool should have a pretty strict attendance policy.

81
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:16,000
Uh, Darla, Darla, Darla. Absent. Okay. Well this is going to be an awkward class period. Mommy's

82
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:23,520
getting drunk. Why? First, I think why would you want to go to go to high school? Why would you

83
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:28,800
question like, why would you just slip in like, Oh, high school? Yeah. You know, you can enroll

84
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:32,880
in that shit. If you don't like homeschooling, you can be like, I'm just going to go to school

85
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:40,240
school, you know, school, school. Yeah. Not for play play school, school, school. Can,

86
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:47,040
can she audit? Is that allowed? Can she just audit a class? I'm sure that in, in reality,

87
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:51,040
in like real people world, all of these things are fine that you could be homeschooled, but there's

88
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:55,280
like an advanced chemistry class you want to take or something. But what you don't get to do is just

89
00:08:55,280 --> 00:09:00,400
like Jane Goodall slip in and see what it's like amongst the gorillas in the mist. Like you have to

90
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:06,080
like sign up for this shit. Yeah. You have to go to the thing and because at some point the teacher

91
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:11,760
is going to look over and say, and you are, why are you here? Why are you standing in the doorway?

92
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:19,760
Um, I see you. I don't want to, I'm about to knock both homeschoolers and my own father and

93
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:27,120
I apologize to both parties, but there's gotta be a point in your life when you're homeschooled when,

94
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:34,960
for instance, my dad once dumped kitty litter down a drain in our basement and then the kitty

95
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:40,880
litter got stuck. And so he tried to wash it out with bleach and then almost died because of the

96
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:46,400
fumes. Those two things killed him. I don't want my dad to teach me chemistry. Does that make sense?

97
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:50,560
There has to be a moment where you look at your, your parents and you say, no, I don't want to

98
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:55,040
learn this particular thing from you. If I ever have kids and I ended up homeschooling them,

99
00:09:55,040 --> 00:10:00,240
homeschooling is going to become a euphemism for lying school because it's going to be like,

100
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:04,000
how does the sun work? And I'm like, oh, that's a good question. The devil's inside of it.

101
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:08,080
Next question. Are you just go to school in Texas? There's another option.

102
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:11,280
Hey, you know, that's true.

103
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:14,800
Just the bad parts where you hate people. I don't know. I know there are smart parts.

104
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:19,360
So if you're listening and you're upset, I'm not talking about you. I'm talking about the other

105
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:24,240
ones. I just don't understand how you have to be very, very bright to be a teacher. And I'm not

106
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:30,000
saying that everybody who listens to this show, your parents are stupid. I'm just saying that

107
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:34,080
they're teaching you literally every bit of information you're ever going to know. Maybe

108
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:39,440
you want them to like super, super on point with their brain smarts. Like, and I don't think that

109
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:44,080
everybody would possess that, right? Does that make sense? Like I got taught by like 60 different

110
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:49,120
people coming up. Yeah, right. You got their wisdom. You like a, like an educational Highlander,

111
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:54,480
you suck their wisdom out. I sucked up the marrow of their brain bones. And now I'm,

112
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:59,600
I'm the well-rounded person I am today. If it was just my dad, like saying like,

113
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:04,480
Hey, you would be a clone of, of our dad, which I pretty much pretty much already am, but,

114
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:09,920
but like a brain clone, like a brain clone. Yeah. And I think Griffin, you're selling yourself sort

115
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:13,440
of, if you don't think teachers are making up most of it. When I was in high school,

116
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:17,920
that was the smartest I was ever like the knowing the most things I was ever going to know. And then

117
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:23,440
after that, and now as an adult, I know barely anything. I think teachers are just struggling

118
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:27,920
to keep their minds wrapped around the one subject they have to be an expert of because

119
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:32,400
they're adults and they can't remember as many things as they use. I used to know everything.

120
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:38,320
I used to be the smartest man alive. I'm willing to bet that they are reading one chapter ahead

121
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:43,120
in the book every week. You think? Yeah. Yeah. I think they assign a chapter and then they go

122
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:46,160
home and read it too. And they're like, Oh, that's some interesting shit. I should talk about that.

123
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:51,200
I went to a bar trivia night the other night and I got there and they were like, all right,

124
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:54,640
all the questions tonight are going to be geography based. And so what I did,

125
00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:58,480
cause I was there with friends was I just got drunk as drunk as I possibly could as fast as I

126
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:05,040
could. So I can have a reason for not contributing anymore. They'd be like, find Zimbabwe on a map,

127
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:12,960
like I can't. What's a Zimbabwe? Find the toilet. I'm so sick. Uh, I'm sorry that,

128
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:21,040
that you can't go to high school and, and muddle with your peers. Um, can I go to high school?

129
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:28,240
Yeah. I can just kick in the door to a high school and be like, hi, I'm Jeremy. And I have

130
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:34,080
in no way an investigative reporter. My dear friend, Jason is a English teacher and I just

131
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:39,280
walked in that high school that he teaches at and they let me talk to students. So I always think

132
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:44,240
it's a troubling circumstance when you drive up to a high school and there's like that guard shack

133
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:48,720
security tower and they just kind of go, go ahead. Yeah. Go ahead. You're good. What are you doing

134
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:53,520
here at your job? Yeah. What do you think the parameter is that they, that they kick you out?

135
00:12:53,520 --> 00:13:00,000
Like I am here to not touch kids. I don't know that shouldn't even come to your mind.

136
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:06,320
Why are you bringing this up? Why did you even bring it up? Hey guys, I'm an avid believer in

137
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:10,800
the philosophy of waiting as long as possible to wash a pair of jeans for the sake of preserving

138
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:17,680
the color in them. I will often go a few months without washing them. The jeans I wear are usually

139
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:23,760
dark in color. So they do not show food and or coffee stains, nor do they noticeably smell from

140
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:30,080
a distance. My main fear of doing this is that those who see me on a day to day basis and work

141
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:36,240
setting will start to notice that I'm rewearing my jeans every day for weeks on end, or that I am

142
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:44,560
a slob or a hobo. Is this a weird thing to do? Are my fears justified? That's from dirty denim

143
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:53,360
in Detroit. That was my favorite Bruce Springsteen album. Hey, hey buddy. You're a slob. No Travis.

144
00:13:54,000 --> 00:14:01,200
Hey, hey. No, here's when you, when your qualifiers are, they don't noticeably smell from a distance.

145
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:06,800
Yeah. And they're dark so they don't show coffee or food stains. Not that they don't have coffee

146
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:11,280
or food stains. Well sure, a man's gonna spill coffee on his pants. That's, that's gravity. Well,

147
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:16,800
but third is, a few months? Like you're changing seasons with these pants? What I need you to do,

148
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:21,360
Travis, is I need you to go and watch the denim episode of Put This On. You're supposed to wear

149
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:27,280
those jeans out until they, until the smell is so strong that you can't wear them. Wait, so okay.

150
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:31,600
Is he saying- You're like putting on your jeans and trying not to retch.

151
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:40,640
Is he saying that like he, do you think he means he wears them like in a month three times spread

152
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:44,960
out over a month or he's like every day for a month? I think these are his off-court buddies

153
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:49,920
and he's wearing them every day. I mean if you go into work in those. Yeah, he's also wearing them

154
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:53,680
on the court. They're off and on court buddies. Yeah, they're just his constant buddies. They're

155
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:58,000
just his constant buddies. They're his ever buddies. There are many ways to preserve- Have

156
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:04,640
you worn those ever buddies jeans? The new brand? They're nice. They have so many pockets. Your ass

157
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:09,200
looks terrific in those ever buddies. They have little inserts for Glade plugins that you can

158
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:13,760
just like slide right in there and then the smell isn't noticeable from a distance. They have a

159
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:18,960
Teflon weave. It's pretty nice. It really catches the stink and holds it in. But man, watch out

160
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:26,000
when you take it off. There is a visible cloud. You know, I hear people using those instead of

161
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:30,000
security deposit boxes now. You just put them in your ever buddies and- This is where I keep

162
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:40,800
my stink and my bouillon. In my jeans vault. There are just so many better ways to preserve

163
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:47,520
the color of your jeans. Do this. Try like a cold wash. No, like A, wash them inside out because

164
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:53,040
denim's only dyed on the outside. Wash them inside out in a bathtub of cool water with a little bit

165
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:58,000
of color protection, uh, detergent in there. And line dry them instead of tumble dry because that's

166
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:02,480
going to help. And, uh, put a little bit of vinegar in there when you wash them. It helps,

167
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:07,200
uh, lock the dye in. Not a lot. Is that for real? Yeah, for, yeah, for real. I didn't know that.

168
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:12,000
So yeah. All my pants are covered in paint. So I really, I don't know. Travis doesn't own a pair.

169
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:17,840
I swear to God, he's not making that up. Travis works in a shop and all of his, his pants are-

170
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:21,280
That's good. That's good and specific. That's good and specific. Yeah. You know, a shop,

171
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:26,000
like a workshop, like a shop. Travis is in business. A set shop. I work with my hands.

172
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:30,160
He's, all of his pants are covered in paint and holes. And like, I can't go out to dinner with him

173
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:35,920
in a nice place. I actually went and bought one pair of jeans and it has remained untouched, uh,

174
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:41,680
by paint. And it is like the Holy of Holies in my house. We're like, I must know where those pants

175
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:46,720
are at all times and that they aren't touching in my dirty shop pants. Travis and, Travis and I went

176
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:52,240
to America's favorite water park, the Great Wolf Lodge in Cincinnati. His chunks had paint on them.

177
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:57,040
I don't know. I can't understand it. I don't either. Did you paint, did you paint in your

178
00:16:57,040 --> 00:17:03,120
chunks, Travis? I paint in everything. When I started in the shop, I had such like high hopes

179
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:08,240
of like, I will have one pair of paint pants and one paint shirt. And then flash forward two years

180
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:14,400
later where I'm just like, fuck it. And I just, I just pour paint right onto my shirts. I buy them

181
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:25,600
and then just, it's like flash dance pulls a rope and paint covers them completely. Um, I, you are,

182
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:30,800
okay, listen, I don't know how much your jeans cost, but if, but if you are so worried about

183
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:37,840
the dye in your jeans and that is more precious to you than people thinking you as the stinky kid,

184
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:45,360
which they do, I'd wear cheaper jeans. I'd rather be, I'd rather be cheap jeans Charlie

185
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:53,360
than stinky kid Steve. Right? I agree. Get those, hey, right out to Target. Get those $20 Mossimo

186
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:57,120
jeans. They're fine. They're, you know what? They're just fine. Why don't you just get instead

187
00:17:57,120 --> 00:18:03,840
of expensive jeans, more jeans and get like a wider rotation. Double jeans. Get them double

188
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:10,320
jeans. Have you worn, have you worn double Everbuddies? Have you worn those double jean

189
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:17,840
Everbuddies from Gap? It's basically like an airlock system. They cost $300,000. Your dick

190
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:27,280
will suffocate. They are airtight. They keep the last remaining sample of smallpox in there. That's

191
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:33,200
three of my Everbuddies. More or less it's like an iron lung from the waist down.

192
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:38,320
I'm not even sure that we understand the concept of Everbuddy jeans anymore.

193
00:18:39,040 --> 00:18:46,240
Nope. Nope. Pretty sure we don't. And one more thing before we move on. I don't want to call

194
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:52,880
you out on this man, but this isn't a philosophy. Like this isn't the kind of thing that you base

195
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:57,120
your life choices on. Like this is something that like, I don't think we should wash the jeans.

196
00:18:57,120 --> 00:19:04,960
It's not like you're starting like a temple on this. If your jeans smell like hot rotten wood,

197
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:11,040
then like I think people, I think that's going to inform a lot of the decisions in your life.

198
00:19:11,040 --> 00:19:14,960
I feel like this isn't like when someone's like, man, your jeans smell real bad. And you're like,

199
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:22,480
oh, I believe in the towel of gene smelly. Well, that can be, that can be a thing. And I feel like

200
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:27,360
you're totally wrong on this. I feel like that if you say that word, that sentence out loud

201
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:32,640
to somebody, a potential love prospect, that they will leave you, you know, and then that will

202
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:36,720
inform even more decisions of your life. Like in Facebook where it says like religious views,

203
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:40,960
you put smelly jeans. Yeah. I don't wash my jeans to preserve their color.

204
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:46,560
If you want to, if you want to really sell this, um, build a little, put a little, uh,

205
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:50,720
portrait of Matthew McConaughey somewhere in your house, like some votives around it and stuff.

206
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:55,600
Um, does he not wash his jeans? Oh, crusty one. You are the crustiest.

207
00:19:55,600 --> 00:20:01,280
Does he have crusty? He's wearing nothing but crusty dungarees. You know it. Have you?

208
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:07,040
Oh, have you worn the Everbuddy crusty dungarees? The double, the double jeans. They more or less

209
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:11,600
stand up on their own. Double crusty. They got three legs. The only way to get in them is to

210
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:16,080
be lowered in them. Cause they're so, they're just rock hard. They have to be fused onto you.

211
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:20,320
Yeah. Thanks everybody. They're worth every penny though. Worth every penny.

212
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:24,480
How much do you guys spend on jeans? What's the, what's the max? I had this argument with somebody

213
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:30,160
the other day. I don't spend more than like 35 bucks. 20 bucks jeans. 20. I know I'm going to

214
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:35,200
destroy them is the thing. Like I know between wearing cowboy boots and like working in the shop,

215
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:40,960
I'm going to destroy these pants in about a month and a half. Yeah. I, uh, Justin, I don't,

216
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:48,400
I don't like to spend a lot cause I tell myself I'm going to lose weight so soon. They won't fit

217
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:53,920
for very long. I'll say, I'm going to be too skinny for these soon. Not going to be this husky forever,

218
00:20:55,520 --> 00:21:00,480
but I still shop in the Husky boy section. Can you shop in the maternity section?

219
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:08,320
Well, no, I mean, I'm not that, oh, you're saying like, you can send them up. You can send them,

220
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:13,600
you can cinch them up, cinch them with a web belt. You know, you know, you don't have to worry about

221
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:19,680
that with, with everybody's. Yeah. Everybody's are, are, they are molded to your body and you

222
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:24,800
can never take them off. Do you guys remember in back to the future too? He pulls the thing and

223
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:29,680
goes, I'm like sucks out. I want that. Why don't we have that technology? Everybody technology.

224
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:35,440
Yeah. Cause it was a movie. I mean, we don't have like hoverboards. It was a film. It was a

225
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:40,800
fictional. You realize that wasn't a document. That wasn't a docu drama. That was a, it was a

226
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:48,720
fiction. It was a piece of fiction. Yeah. It was a fiction license. Uh-huh. Do you know what a

227
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:54,960
nonfiction is? Um, it was a not, it was not nonfiction. It was fake. It was total fake

228
00:21:54,960 --> 00:22:02,720
Hollywood bullshit. Okay. So it was fake like Benjamin Franklin. Okay. Back it up. Okay.

229
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:08,800
If you see someone on money, they're real. Okay. Got it. He was really one of our, our earliest

230
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:14,800
presidents. Benjamin Franklin. If you see somebody on, if you see somebody on spin city, then it's

231
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:21,200
fake. Uh-huh. Does that make sense to you? So Michael J. Fox is not a real person. Okay.

232
00:22:22,160 --> 00:22:26,800
Are you saying, Griffin, are you only saying that people projects that involve people

233
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:32,320
with Parkinson's disease are fake? Is that a nonfiction? That's cold. That's cold.

234
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:38,320
This whole thing has gotten away from me. Yeah. I, I think you're the one who maybe needs the word

235
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:45,760
class on words. Whenever I talk to my friends about a cartoon, a comic game, manga or anime,

236
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:52,000
they seem interested in it. What's up? No, you didn't. You read all those words.

237
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:59,280
You did such a good job representing our, our, our Japanese ties. Manga and anime. Is that correct?

238
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:05,120
Yeah. That's proper. And they seem interested in it. I offer to lend them to discuss the media.

239
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:09,280
The thing is that from time to time I give them stuff. I get it back. They never touch it.

240
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:12,640
At this point, I'm considering if I should stop lending stuff out all together,

241
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:17,600
but I really do want to share the joy slash hate of these things and discuss it with my friends.

242
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:23,280
What should I do? That's the lost lore lender of Los Angeles. Can I, can we take a moment and say

243
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:29,040
that everybody is getting very good at those nicknames? Yeah. Everyone's doing a much better

244
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:33,440
job. I think that sometimes people spend more time coming up with the clever nicknames than they do

245
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:36,960
the question. And I love it. Don't get me wrong, but I would like to think that people said, they

246
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:42,080
go, I have this really important pressing question, but not yet. Not yet. I know what my name is going

247
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:49,280
to be. Let me say something up. I think that this question asker needs to be a little bit better

248
00:23:49,280 --> 00:23:53,280
detecting when people are being polite. Yes. That's what I was going to say. You need to take a long,

249
00:23:53,280 --> 00:23:58,160
hard look and say, are they really interested? Cause if all you talk about is Gundam when you're

250
00:23:58,160 --> 00:24:02,560
hanging out with them, then eventually like they're just going to, they're going to,

251
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:09,280
they're going to say, yes, Gundam. Yes. That sounds pretty cool. Okay. If you spend, uh,

252
00:24:09,280 --> 00:24:15,840
like 30 minutes laying out the whole plot to Gundam Onoriki B7 party down,

253
00:24:17,680 --> 00:24:21,760
that's the one about the vitamins, right? Yeah. That's the one about the vitamins that work at

254
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:26,160
a catering service. Yeah. It's, it's really good. It's, I mean like it's underappreciated,

255
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:30,800
but if you spend 30 minutes relating the plot to them, they're not going to look you dead in the

256
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:36,800
eye and say, well, that sounds like incomprehensible bullshit. They're going to say like, sounds like

257
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:44,240
some real made up rigamarole. Sounds sounds pretty good to me. Pretty good. And so I would say good

258
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:49,440
rule of thumb is if they ask to borrow it, let them borrow it, but don't be like, Hey, remember

259
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:53,520
that thing we talked about yesterday that you said sounded kind of cool? I brought it in today. Here

260
00:24:53,520 --> 00:25:01,440
you go. They don't want it. It's also really hard to, you got to stop thinking of, I, I want to get

261
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:09,520
them into the things that I like and try to think of what, what they will actually enjoy rather than

262
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:12,720
just trying to convert them because it's good. There are many things that are good that the

263
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:16,720
people in your life won't care for. Like for instance, I watched Breaking Bad by myself

264
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:22,480
because I know my wife would not enjoy it. It's very grim, but it's still a good show. I mean,

265
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:28,000
I enjoy it, but it's not her taste. That's how I was with Twin Peaks. Twin Peaks is an amazing

266
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:32,880
show, but I know that that is not Teresa's bag. You know, I actually learned this lesson from

267
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:37,680
my buddy Brent, Brent O'Floss. When we were in together in college, I would come to him,

268
00:25:37,680 --> 00:25:41,040
like when Family Guy first came out and I was sitting there going, dude, you're going to love

269
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:47,280
this. Check it out. And he more or less politely refused to watch it because I was so passionate

270
00:25:47,280 --> 00:25:52,480
about trying to get him to do it that he kind of pushed back naturally. Well, way to go, Travis.

271
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:57,280
Well, but then two years later, he started watching it on his own and came back and said,

272
00:25:57,280 --> 00:26:03,040
you're right. Family Guy is awesome. And like, but that's the story of how Brent started watching

273
00:26:03,040 --> 00:26:10,960
Family Guy. People have been writing in and asking us for the origin story of watching Family Guy.

274
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:15,440
And there you have it. I saw him hear the whole story. You can check out my blog,

275
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:20,480
how Brent started doing stuff. The next issue of the Brent O'Floss comic is good.

276
00:26:21,040 --> 00:26:26,560
It's going to be about his origins. How did Brent start scrapbooking? That's what I want.

277
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:32,800
You got a scrapbook. Scrapbooking is awesome. These pictures are everywhere.

278
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:39,280
Check out these wallpaper samples I found. Check out this floral print. I got a really fun,

279
00:26:39,280 --> 00:26:45,360
really kicky foam font that you can stick on to just say like winner or home run or top

280
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:51,920
prize or blue ribbon or science fair or any wedding day, day before wedding day.

281
00:26:51,920 --> 00:26:55,200
Baby's first gum, whatever. Baby's last gum.

282
00:26:58,800 --> 00:27:03,360
Put that gum down. Science fair.

283
00:27:03,920 --> 00:27:13,840
Never again. Dear Bubble Yum, your product choked my baby. I would like a refund and I will put

284
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:26,160
your response in my scrapbook. I also think not to in any way put down these media forms at all,

285
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:33,520
but as you move into things like manga, anime, comics, that kind of stuff, you are less likely

286
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:39,200
to reach a wider audience. Yeah, they're pretty esoteric and that's fine because the people that

287
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:41,440
you are going to find who are going to be enthusiastic about them are going to be

288
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:47,120
doubly, doubly enthusiastic. But maybe there's a difference between like, oh, you've never seen

289
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:53,440
the Star Wars movies. Check these out. And like, here's Vampire Love Diary, Killer Samurai 7.

290
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:58,480
Yeah, because a lot of the, a lot of the, especially with things like manga and anime,

291
00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:03,760
there's a lot of cultural touchstones. You really need to be indoctrinated in

292
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:08,960
before you, you know, you can really get the most out of it. And it's kind of hard,

293
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:13,440
I think, for some people to just sort of get on board with that whole aesthetic without,

294
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:18,560
you know, really growing up with it and being introduced to it a lot.

295
00:28:19,680 --> 00:28:22,240
If you want to do geeky, start out with something easier.

296
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:24,720
Like Scott Pilgrim is a good place to start with manga.

297
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:30,720
No, that's not. Yeah, that's a good idea. See, there you go. Get them, you ease them into the

298
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:37,280
queues, the cute little story about a guy who loves a girl and also loves poutine and work from

299
00:28:37,280 --> 00:28:42,560
there, build from there. But I think good rules wait for them to ask to borrow it.

300
00:28:42,560 --> 00:28:47,520
What is a manga? And you say, oh, friend, come to me. This is Evangelion.

301
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:55,440
I think it's also just like anything else where if you are too forward, if you're the guy who's

302
00:28:55,440 --> 00:29:00,720
trying too hard, like if you're the guy that brings something in anytime anyone talks about it,

303
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:05,120
you're going to become less and less popular. So make them want it.

304
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:09,840
It's annoying. What you do is you show them where it is on your shelf and say,

305
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:12,800
it's over here if you want to borrow it. It's over there if you want to borrow it.

306
00:29:12,800 --> 00:29:19,920
And then if they want to borrow it, fine, God bless. But yeah, don't pressure them because,

307
00:29:19,920 --> 00:29:26,160
yeah, you're right. I mean, it's a weird situation to have something that someone

308
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:30,320
lets you that you don't really want to read or watch. I did that with Griffin's novel for

309
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:35,680
about a year. I just gave it back eventually. Wait, what? Sorry? You said you loved it.

310
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:43,120
Are you talking about Grant Andrews Kid Cop? I read the entirety. No, I'm sorry. Grant Andrews

311
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:48,160
Kid Cop, I loved very much. I knew I was going to love it. It was one of those, you know,

312
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:54,240
when you meet someone right away, you know, this is something special. I felt that way

313
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:58,720
about after the first three pages, like I read them. I think we can all agree that

314
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:02,720
Grant Andrews Kid Cop is lightning in a bottle. Yeah, it is lightning in a bottle.

315
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:06,880
I wanted to savor it. I'm reading a page a year. You know, you have to be careful with lightning

316
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:09,840
in a bottle because if you let it out, you get struck by lightning and you die.

317
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:13,520
I hope Travis said it's not lightning in a bottle because I'm already working on

318
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:20,640
Grant Andrews Teen Cop. He goes around patrolling the area for teen crimes on his jetpack.

319
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:23,840
I'm just glad, Griffin, that you're working on these sequels in a timely manner.

320
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:29,440
Oh, I will be on my deathbed working on Grant Andrews 20 something cop.

321
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:39,280
I'm looking forward to Grant Andrews Cop because he will get to that point.

322
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:48,320
And then crazy old Mr. Andrews in the house down the lane.

323
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:52,400
If we get the crazy old Mr. Andrews, Griffin's going to really have to start doing some clean

324
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:57,840
living to get to like one hundred and thirty seven. Yeah, I am looking forward to Grant Andrews

325
00:30:57,840 --> 00:31:02,320
meets Paul Blart. Yeah, that's the crossover that I'm doing with the team.

326
00:31:03,520 --> 00:31:07,200
Man, what about Grandpa Cop? That's a nice little turn of phrase.

327
00:31:08,560 --> 00:31:12,480
You like Grandpa Cop? I like Grandpa Cop because, well, I mean, that's pretty much

328
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:20,960
that's pretty much every Clint Eastwood movie that's been released since the early 90s.

329
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:30,560
Yeah, pretty much. I want smothers! I know. I know you do. Where's the justice?

330
00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:35,520
No, you gave away your Werther's. You gave them to everyone. I had a bag full of Werther's.

331
00:31:35,520 --> 00:31:39,520
Yeah, I know. I miss my dog. Which one?

332
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:49,600
You've had many dogs over the years. I'm putting your baggy jeans under arrest. My gun is heavy.

333
00:31:52,400 --> 00:31:57,600
Come back here. I'm three feet away. I'm just standing. Come closer.

334
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:03,440
We're making fun of Clint Eastwood now, and I don't know how I feel about that.

335
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:08,160
Let him come for me. Let him come. He will come with a swift breeze of death.

336
00:32:08,160 --> 00:32:12,000
Do you guys want a Yahoo? Yes, please. Are you sure?

337
00:32:13,280 --> 00:32:16,560
I'm positive. This one is to get riled up. Is that it?

338
00:32:16,560 --> 00:32:20,800
Yeah, I want you to get psyched. This one was sent in by Kristen Travers. Thank you, Kristen.

339
00:32:20,800 --> 00:32:32,080
It's by Yahoo Answers user. Oh, fuck. Sayamara, who asks, this one was asked by Psyduck, the Pokemon.

340
00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:38,880
He asks, can you list the reasons? Psyduck, Psyduck. That's what he asks. That's all he says.

341
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:45,440
That was Justin's Pokemon impression. Can you list the reasons why a man cries?

342
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:55,120
As many as possible be appreciated. Like a full list? I think he wants something comprehensive.

343
00:32:55,120 --> 00:33:00,880
Well, if it's me, number one at the top of that list is cartoon robots.

344
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:09,520
Cartoon robots are the saddest, whether they be toasters or Wall-E's, Iron Giants.

345
00:33:09,520 --> 00:33:12,400
Yeah, Iron Giants. Iron Giants is the saddest.

346
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:18,880
And then a subcategory of that is any Pixar movie where somebody learns a lesson.

347
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:25,120
I'm gonna cry in that. Cartoon robots is right, because only men cry at those.

348
00:33:26,160 --> 00:33:32,480
Pixar movies, I feel like, is more universal. I've seen females cry at Pixar movies.

349
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:39,920
Right, but women cry watching Up for the wrong reasons. They don't know that Ed Asner is a robot.

350
00:33:39,920 --> 00:33:46,400
Yeah, they didn't understand the subtle hints and clues that his character is actually a robot.

351
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:49,600
I mean, really, they're all robots.

352
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:53,920
Look how big he is. He's two feet tall. You ever see a person like that?

353
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:59,840
Yeah, he's like a little robot. He's boxy, too. He's cuboid.

354
00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:01,200
He was a little servo-bot.

355
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:03,040
A servo-bot with a dead-dead wife.

356
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:12,640
When something falls on their privates or something with velocity collides with their private area.

357
00:34:12,640 --> 00:34:16,560
I would say if anything falls on them in general.

358
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:22,320
No, because I can take a blow to the head from like an umbrella that falls down on me.

359
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:28,000
But if that umbrella somehow squarely falls on my penis, then the tears, that's what makes the tears.

360
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,640
Hey guys, straight up, I'm going to call you guys out.

361
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:35,040
What is the most random weirdest thing that you've ever gotten choked up over?

362
00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:39,440
There is a statement that says,

363
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:46,800
There is a Staples commercial where the dad is at the store and he says,

364
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:51,120
we have to buy all these supplies and they're for the kids and his wife's a teacher.

365
00:34:51,120 --> 00:34:54,480
And she's like, well, the school doesn't have enough money this year.

366
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:58,000
And then she sees him at another register later,

367
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:03,040
even though he was upset and he's buying some supplies for the class.

368
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:05,600
I want you to know, I actually just got choked up.

369
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:08,160
Just listening to you tell about the story, that's beautiful.

370
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:10,640
I'm getting worked up again, the Staples commercial.

371
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:15,920
Any more? Now that I'm an old man, any Christmas commercial?

372
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:17,520
Literally any Christmas commercial.

373
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:23,920
For me, it's that Zales commercial, or no, it's Kay, Kay Jewelers, where they're in the cabin.

374
00:35:24,640 --> 00:35:29,200
And the girl and the guy are standing there and the lightning strikes.

375
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:31,600
And he holds her and he's like, don't worry, I'm here.

376
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:34,080
I'll always be here.

377
00:35:34,080 --> 00:35:38,240
And he gives her the thing and I cry because that woman's about to be murdered.

378
00:35:38,240 --> 00:35:42,880
She's about to get murdered in the cabin and all of her friends and family will never see her again.

379
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:47,600
I got a call bullshit because I opened my heart with that Staples commercial revelation

380
00:35:47,600 --> 00:35:50,880
and you went for a gag and I had to call shenanigans on it.

381
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:52,720
You want to know what commercials I've cried at?

382
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:56,240
This is an embarrassing deep dark secret.

383
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:00,640
Katy Perry's Firework.

384
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:06,240
Fuck you. What? Wait, hold on. No more questions today, kids.

385
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:07,520
Hold on one second, Travis.

386
00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:13,520
Was it because the song played right after you won the season finale of America's Next Top Model?

387
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:16,480
No, wait, you weren't on America's Next Top Model.

388
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:20,480
I was having a particularly rough, sleepy day.

389
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:23,680
I was at the end of like a hundred hour work week, like I often do.

390
00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:29,520
And I just was singing at the top of my lungs, but saying, I'm a firework.

391
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:31,840
And it was particularly moving.

392
00:36:31,840 --> 00:36:34,400
And now I wish I would just kept that one to myself.

393
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:38,080
I don't know if it's better if you're joking or not.

394
00:36:38,080 --> 00:36:41,440
Like, I can't, I can't know. You can never tell me.

395
00:36:42,080 --> 00:36:44,720
Actually, no, I need you to tell me this is a joke right now.

396
00:36:44,720 --> 00:36:46,560
I need you to tell me you're kidding.

397
00:36:46,560 --> 00:36:51,760
No, I like the picture of a single tear rolling down your paint covered face

398
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:54,640
and then resting gently in the nestles of your beard.

399
00:36:56,240 --> 00:36:59,120
Firework, Travis, don't ever let anybody-

400
00:36:59,120 --> 00:37:01,360
That is true. You are a firework.

401
00:37:01,360 --> 00:37:04,480
I've long thought, when Travis McElroy springs to mind,

402
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:06,480
it's with a trail of sparks behind him.

403
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:09,120
Cause he, goddammit, he's a firework.

404
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:12,480
You know what the worst part about that is to you?

405
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:15,360
Yeah, I do, Travis. I know what the worst part is.

406
00:37:15,360 --> 00:37:17,680
I know what the worst part is, Travis, I do.

407
00:37:17,680 --> 00:37:20,560
I do know the worst part. It's the part that it is it.

408
00:37:20,560 --> 00:37:23,840
It is the thing that it is, the fact that it is that.

409
00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:25,040
The thing it is?

410
00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:26,640
The thing it is is the worst thing.

411
00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:30,480
It is the thing and then you do it. Like-

412
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:31,760
You've heard the song, right?

413
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:35,520
You didn't just cry at the idea of it. Like, you heard the song.

414
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:38,400
I want you guys to know I'm crying right now.

415
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:43,120
So I changed it. That's the last thing I got chugged up by you guys being mean.

416
00:37:43,120 --> 00:37:43,920
I like to cry.

417
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:45,360
Cause baby, I'm a firework.

418
00:37:46,240 --> 00:37:49,440
How dare you talk to a firework like that?

419
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:54,400
Do you guys ever just think about sad things to try and get a good cry out?

420
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:57,200
I never, I didn't until about 30 seconds ago.

421
00:37:57,200 --> 00:37:59,600
Now I got all the sad things I need to last me forever.

422
00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:03,760
Um, his crying feels so good, I think.

423
00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:06,320
It's like, it's like, it's like jerking it for your eyes.

424
00:38:08,080 --> 00:38:11,120
Forcing, forcing a cry is like jerking it for your emotions.

425
00:38:11,120 --> 00:38:14,000
Well, have you ever heard someone say that anyone ever,

426
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:15,760
when you hear someone say it's a tear jerker?

427
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:20,720
That's what they're talking about.

428
00:38:20,720 --> 00:38:24,400
And now that is not using, uh, tears as a lubricant as you masturbate.

429
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:24,960
No, no.

430
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:27,280
That's something Jeffrey Dahmer does. Don't do that.

431
00:38:29,840 --> 00:38:31,440
Dead. Jeffrey Dahmer dead. I'm sorry.

432
00:38:32,080 --> 00:38:33,920
Do you guys know what we forgot to do last week?

433
00:38:34,720 --> 00:38:35,040
Fuck.

434
00:38:35,040 --> 00:38:35,600
Oh God.

435
00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:38,000
We've got to ring in the new month.

436
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:38,240
Yeah.

437
00:38:38,240 --> 00:38:38,720
Like we do.

438
00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:43,520
Um, I just, God, time is so tight. Let's just burn through them.

439
00:38:43,520 --> 00:38:45,840
Apple month. That'd be appropriate, wouldn't it?

440
00:38:45,840 --> 00:38:47,520
Yeah. Appropriate. Appropriate moving.

441
00:38:48,080 --> 00:38:50,320
Uh, church safety and security month.

442
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:52,160
Cut out dissection month.

443
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:53,760
Eat better. Eat together month.

444
00:38:56,160 --> 00:38:59,280
Energy management is a family affair. Improve your home month.

445
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:00,720
Shut the fuck up.

446
00:39:00,720 --> 00:39:02,160
That's not a month.

447
00:39:02,160 --> 00:39:04,560
You just said the whole, it took a whole month to say it.

448
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:07,440
Um, feral hog month.

449
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:08,640
There. Yep.

450
00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:09,520
Hog out month.

451
00:39:09,520 --> 00:39:14,080
Uh, feral hog is a good one.

452
00:39:14,080 --> 00:39:15,040
Watch out for that pig.

453
00:39:15,680 --> 00:39:16,800
That's pretty much sums it up.

454
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:17,360
The end.

455
00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:19,360
Month of free thought.

456
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:24,240
It's national chili month.

457
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:28,640
It's also national caramel month, but I would prefer chili, I think.

458
00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:34,320
If you see a web that says, holy fucking shit, feral pig, just turn around and run.

459
00:39:35,360 --> 00:39:36,160
What is it?

460
00:39:36,160 --> 00:39:37,840
Do I even know what a feral pig is?

461
00:39:37,840 --> 00:39:39,280
Cause I don't think I do.

462
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:39,440
Yeah.

463
00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:43,440
I think it's a pig that was raised by wolves.

464
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:47,360
Guys, this is the fucking coolest month I'm going through.

465
00:39:47,360 --> 00:39:48,400
It's pizza month.

466
00:39:49,600 --> 00:39:51,680
Guys, it's sausage month.

467
00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:53,360
Guys, it's raptor month.

468
00:39:54,160 --> 00:39:54,880
What?

469
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:56,320
What is the coolest things?

470
00:39:56,320 --> 00:39:57,520
Pizza and raptors.

471
00:39:58,400 --> 00:39:59,440
And raptor pizza.

472
00:40:00,080 --> 00:40:01,200
I'd like a pizza.

473
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:05,680
If you could just put some sausage and feral pig on that.

474
00:40:05,680 --> 00:40:14,160
A feral meat is something that is domesticated and then became wild.

475
00:40:14,160 --> 00:40:16,000
It went from being domesticated to wild.

476
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:22,320
Oh, so this is like people that have released their pot-bellied pigs back into the wild?

477
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:23,440
Okay.

478
00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:24,080
Let's do this.

479
00:40:24,080 --> 00:40:25,600
This is a good thread.

480
00:40:27,120 --> 00:40:31,600
How about, hey, have you guys seen babe pig in the city with a gun?

481
00:40:33,840 --> 00:40:35,440
My brother, my brother, and me.

482
00:40:35,440 --> 00:40:37,280
Not so much a PSA though, was it?

483
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:37,520
No.

484
00:40:37,520 --> 00:40:38,160
How about this?

485
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:43,040
Hey, stop flushing your baby piglets down the toilet because then they grow to be feral

486
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:44,800
in the sewers and it's terrifying.

487
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:46,400
My brother, my brother, and me.

488
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:48,400
It's a little wordy, but I'll accept it.

489
00:40:49,040 --> 00:40:52,960
Oh no, you flushed too many baby piglets and now you've made a pig king.

490
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:54,960
Oh, the pig king.

491
00:40:55,680 --> 00:40:56,640
He was right there.

492
00:40:56,640 --> 00:40:59,280
Oh, a pig king would be so adorable, wouldn't it?

493
00:40:59,280 --> 00:41:01,200
With all of its snoots and snouts.

494
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:03,120
Look at all these little corkscrew tails.

495
00:41:03,120 --> 00:41:04,800
I want to pinch him, pig king.

496
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:10,160
My brother, how about this?

497
00:41:11,600 --> 00:41:15,520
Why has no one ever caught on tape a fight between a feral pig and an urban fox?

498
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:16,800
My brother, my brother, and me.

499
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:20,400
Man, that would be fucking, that's the new sci-fi ridge, isn't it?

500
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:25,040
How else are you going to get feral bacon?

501
00:41:26,720 --> 00:41:27,680
My brother and me.

502
00:41:27,680 --> 00:41:29,120
What do you guys think about this?

503
00:41:29,120 --> 00:41:31,280
My brother and me.

504
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:35,280
I would know more ways to warn people.

505
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:37,040
Obviously you should stay away from a feral pig.

506
00:41:37,600 --> 00:41:40,240
Because I don't know what kind of diseases it's contracted.

507
00:41:40,240 --> 00:41:42,960
I just don't know how to warn people against this thing

508
00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:44,560
if I haven't seen it in action.

509
00:41:44,560 --> 00:41:45,440
Is it fast?

510
00:41:46,480 --> 00:41:47,440
Is it dangerous?

511
00:41:47,440 --> 00:41:48,160
Will it bite you?

512
00:41:53,360 --> 00:41:57,040
What is the difference between a feral pig and a wild boar?

513
00:41:57,040 --> 00:41:58,400
That's my question.

514
00:41:58,960 --> 00:42:00,480
Is that, are those the same thing?

515
00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:05,280
I think a feral pig has known the luxuries, the conveniences of mankind.

516
00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:06,080
Yeah.

517
00:42:06,080 --> 00:42:08,080
And a wild boar hasn't.

518
00:42:08,080 --> 00:42:11,120
And I don't know if that makes it, I don't know if that makes it tough.

519
00:42:11,120 --> 00:42:15,040
I feel like a feral pig is just going to be kind of sad.

520
00:42:15,040 --> 00:42:17,680
The feral pig is just going to think about the life that he used to have

521
00:42:17,680 --> 00:42:19,520
and he doesn't have anymore, you know?

522
00:42:19,520 --> 00:42:20,560
Right, right.

523
00:42:21,440 --> 00:42:22,640
He's going to be bitter.

524
00:42:22,640 --> 00:42:25,760
It looks like they're going to be, I'm doing a little research right now

525
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:27,040
on the internet.

526
00:42:27,040 --> 00:42:31,200
It looks like they're, it looks like they're going to be a furrier.

527
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:32,480
Okay.

528
00:42:32,480 --> 00:42:34,880
It looks like they're going to have big tusks.

529
00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:35,680
Oh no.

530
00:42:35,680 --> 00:42:39,840
It actually looks, they basically look like Peter Jackson in short.

531
00:42:39,840 --> 00:42:46,400
You can imagine Peter Jackson with bigger lower teeth.

532
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:48,000
That's what a feral pig looks like.

533
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:49,440
And slightly more charm.

534
00:42:49,440 --> 00:42:54,960
Hey, Peter Jackson, I liked you way better when you were super fat.

535
00:42:54,960 --> 00:42:57,840
When you were so jolly.

536
00:42:57,840 --> 00:43:00,880
When you looked like the kind of guy who had spent his entire life

537
00:43:00,880 --> 00:43:03,040
directing a Lord of the Rings movie.

538
00:43:03,040 --> 00:43:03,440
Yeah.

539
00:43:03,440 --> 00:43:05,920
I feel like you're getting above your raisin right now.

540
00:43:05,920 --> 00:43:06,400
Yeah.

541
00:43:06,400 --> 00:43:10,880
You went from looking like a dwarf to an elf to use terminology

542
00:43:10,880 --> 00:43:11,920
that you would understand.

543
00:43:11,920 --> 00:43:12,400
Yeah.

544
00:43:12,400 --> 00:43:13,040
I don't like it.

545
00:43:13,680 --> 00:43:14,720
I don't like it one bit.

546
00:43:14,720 --> 00:43:15,920
I don't like emaciated.

547
00:43:15,920 --> 00:43:19,280
I want to give you a sandwich made of the finest elven bread.

548
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:21,920
And wild and feral pig.

549
00:43:21,920 --> 00:43:23,200
Sweet, sweet feral pig.

550
00:43:23,200 --> 00:43:24,080
Is this feral pig?

551
00:43:24,080 --> 00:43:25,440
This is delicious.

552
00:43:25,440 --> 00:43:27,280
And then I look at, dad?

553
00:43:27,280 --> 00:43:28,400
That's not your dad.

554
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:30,160
It's feral pig.

555
00:43:31,520 --> 00:43:33,200
You know, there are a big problem in Cape Canaveral.

556
00:43:33,760 --> 00:43:36,640
Down in Florida, you'll see them rolling around.

557
00:43:36,640 --> 00:43:39,520
Florida can't, Florida makes me so fucking angry the way

558
00:43:39,520 --> 00:43:41,200
they treat animals down there.

559
00:43:41,200 --> 00:43:41,600
Yep.

560
00:43:41,600 --> 00:43:43,200
They throw alligators in sewers.

561
00:43:43,200 --> 00:43:46,080
They throw feral pigs out in pig bins.

562
00:43:46,080 --> 00:43:47,760
They throw alligators at pigs.

563
00:43:49,200 --> 00:43:50,640
They make pig gators.

564
00:43:50,640 --> 00:43:51,440
They make gator pigs.

565
00:43:51,440 --> 00:43:54,560
They put birds in slingshots and then throw them at pigs.

566
00:43:55,120 --> 00:43:56,160
Crocoswine!

567
00:43:57,840 --> 00:43:59,840
The monster I just invented is Crocoswine.

568
00:44:01,840 --> 00:44:02,240
That's it.

569
00:44:03,040 --> 00:44:03,680
I don't have a joke.

570
00:44:03,680 --> 00:44:04,480
I just wanted to-

571
00:44:04,480 --> 00:44:06,480
He's got the teeth of a gator.

572
00:44:06,480 --> 00:44:07,840
The ears of a pig.

573
00:44:07,840 --> 00:44:11,840
He's got tusks and tusks and tusks and back ridges.

574
00:44:13,200 --> 00:44:14,320
Like the crocodile does.

575
00:44:14,320 --> 00:44:15,520
And he loves you.

576
00:44:15,520 --> 00:44:17,120
And he loves you so much.

577
00:44:17,120 --> 00:44:18,000
Give him a kiss.

578
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:18,480
No, don't.

579
00:44:18,480 --> 00:44:22,000
He's got so many tusks.

580
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:24,800
Crocoswine, tusks, and ridges.

581
00:44:24,800 --> 00:44:26,240
Don't let him bite your face.

582
00:44:27,440 --> 00:44:30,240
He's got a tail and another tail that's curlier.

583
00:44:32,400 --> 00:44:34,560
That's the one that Grant's wishes if you cut it off.

584
00:44:34,560 --> 00:44:35,200
Just-

585
00:44:35,200 --> 00:44:37,760
He will give you bacon and boots.

586
00:44:40,080 --> 00:44:41,200
I'm gonna be honest.

587
00:44:41,200 --> 00:44:43,440
I thought Crocoswine would be much more intimidating,

588
00:44:43,440 --> 00:44:44,880
but he sounds pretty cool.

589
00:44:44,880 --> 00:44:46,800
I wanna hang out with him.

590
00:44:46,800 --> 00:44:49,440
If it weren't for all the tusks, he'd make a great home pet.

591
00:44:49,440 --> 00:44:51,440
If it weren't for all those genie tusks.

592
00:44:51,440 --> 00:44:53,840
He's like the giving tree of feral animals.

593
00:44:53,840 --> 00:44:58,480
He's gonna give you bacon and boots with his meat and his skin.

594
00:44:59,360 --> 00:45:02,160
And he'll make you sweat penicillin, which is nice.

595
00:45:02,160 --> 00:45:04,880
He'll make people think you're hanging out with Peter Jackson.

596
00:45:06,720 --> 00:45:10,720
Oh, that's unfair because I feel like Peter Jackson isn't as scaly as Crocoswine.

597
00:45:10,720 --> 00:45:11,600

who asks, me and my girlfriend want to have a role playing sex

638

Squirt on the lips.

Did I mess that up?

00:47:26,560 --> 00:47:27,200
You sure did.
