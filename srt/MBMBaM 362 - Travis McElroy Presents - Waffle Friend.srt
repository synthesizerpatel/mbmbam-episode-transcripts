1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:30,800
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:48,400
Hello, everybody, and welcome to My Brother, My Brother, and Me,

6
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:54,240
an advice show for the modern era. I'm your oldest brother, Pupa Justin McElroy.

7
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:59,520
I'm your middlest brother, Travis McElroy. Not sure what the theme was.

8
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:02,800
Not sure what that is. I'm sweet baby brother, 30 under 30 media luminary,

9
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:05,120
Griffin McElroy. Justin, explain yourself immediately.

10
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:15,280
I am but a pupa that is snuggling into a chrysalis right now, and have been so for 36-odd years.

11
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:17,760
Why are you a French pope?

12
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:22,560
Is this a slow-carb thing? Is this like one of the phases of the slow-carb,

13
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:26,320
like you eat a bunch of beans, and then you turn those beans into a chrysalis,

14
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:31,680
and then you become larval? He tears up strips of newspaper,

15
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:36,080
smears his bean goo upon them, and they'll form his house.

16
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:42,320
It's nothing like the dumb thing you guys said. Today is Friday. Tomorrow, July 8th,

17
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:50,080
I'm going to go see Mr. James Buffett live in concert, and in doing so, I will have

18
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:55,840
completed my development as a person, and I will emerge like a butterfly.

19
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:58,480
Ah, we're going to bliss the light situation.

20
00:01:58,480 --> 00:02:02,400
Yeah, that's what I was just about to say. It sounds like maybe Justin's going to come back

21
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:05,360
maybe a new character on the next episode of My Brother, My Brother and Me,

22
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:08,800
which I'm very excited about. Can you tell me how you've been preparing your body?

23
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:11,360
Is there some sort of powder that you apply?

24
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:18,640
I went through every Hawaiian shirt I owned, and all the ones Amazon had to find the perfect one,

25
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:24,320
and I've been re-listening to some tunes to try to pick out some nuance, and maybe reading up on

26
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:29,120
some trivia that I can kind of spout during, like, hey, did you know he wrote this one?

27
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:33,840
Wherever. Lauderdale? You know, I haven't read much yet, so there's still time.

28
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:37,840
Jesus, no, Justin, there's not much time. It's tomorrow. This is like your fucking

29
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:42,880
capstone project. You think you can just fucking buffalo this one in at the last minute? No.

30
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:52,880
My question is this. Will James Buffett witness me? Will he witness me? Will he, since I am there,

31
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:56,960
like, and this one goes out to Island Boy or something like that?

32
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:59,920
Yeah. Do you want to back channel this?

33
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:06,080
That's, I mean, that's kind of a, that's kind of a crest. It'll work, but I mean,

34
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:11,840
you really want to leverage your limited media power for this one. But the answer is yes,

35
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:13,360
of course you want to do that. Yes, obviously.

36
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:16,880
I mean, I think there's also a lot of, like, tried and true standard options here.

37
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,600
You could just try singing along with all the songs louder than anybody else, the loudest.

38
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:22,880
Oh, that's a good idea.

39
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:24,960
If you do it loud enough and good enough, they don't tell you this,

40
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:27,920
when we're up on stage doing our jokes, when you do our jokes,

41
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:33,840
the loudest and the best out of anybody, we see you. There's recognition there.

42
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:39,520
Maybe if you, maybe if you yell the trivia to James Buffett and you're like,

43
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:44,080
hey, you wrote this one in Key West, he'll be like, thank you for reminding me, Island Boy.

44
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:48,320
You know, you know how to fly a plane. Yes, I did.

45
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:53,360
I do know that. Thank you. Is that Island Boy? I recognize you. Come up here. Come up here.

46
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:57,600
You do one. Island Boy, did you know I was also a restaurateur, right?

47
00:03:57,600 --> 00:04:01,200
Yeah, restaurateur and pilot. Yeah, an author.

48
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:06,000
Now have you considered, and I hope the answer is no, but I need to know if you've

49
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:11,360
seen all the angles of this thing, rushing the stage and attacking James Buffett.

50
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:15,680
Now what would that accomplish? How would that get me further,

51
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:18,640
how would that get me closer to the goals of my vision board?

52
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:23,200
Well, he would certainly, I mean, he would definitely know,

53
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:26,480
he would definitely know Island Boy. He would witness me.

54
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:29,680
Well, maybe he's just been waiting for a challenger.

55
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:33,520
Maybe he's ready to hand over his blown out flip flops.

56
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:38,240
This is a bad plan. I'm not endorsing this plan, but it's

57
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:44,960
worked in the past, that's all I'm going to say. So you're suggesting I rush up on stage, I rend my

58
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:52,000
Hawaiian shirt in twain, I toss Jimmy Buffett a bat left, and I battle him for supremacy of

59
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:56,320
like Island Lord. You'll lose. You'll def, def, def, def lose.

60
00:04:56,320 --> 00:05:00,080
But maybe he'll like Mr. Miyagi you, take you under his wing.

61
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:02,480
No, he'll kill you. He'll kill you on stage. I see something in you.

62
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:07,760
No, he'll kill you right there on the stage. How high up can you jump? Because I imagine

63
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:11,440
this, this stage is going to be four or five feet up off the ground.

64
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:16,000
It's at Riverbend in Cincinnati. Travis, I don't know. Have you ever been there?

65
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:21,120
Okay. You're in an amphitheater situation then. So the stage I believe is lower and you might be

66
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:24,240
able to jump. That's great. You could just parachute right down onto that thing. Bat

67
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:29,120
lefts out. And it just, it just really attacked Jimmy Buffett.

68
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:32,240
I want to attack Jimmy Buffett. He has to make the first move.

69
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:36,160
You really need to pick the right song. What's the bet? You're at a Jimmy Buffett concert.

70
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:41,680
What's the best song to get the drop on Jimmy Buffett during? Cause like, if it's something,

71
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:46,560
I think like Margaritaville, I think he pretty much, that's just muscle memory at this point.

72
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:50,080
Like he will definitely see you coming. Is there more of an emotional ballad where he's

73
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:54,480
maybe thinking of like a long lost friend? Or maybe one of his new songs.

74
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:57,520
You're thinking like one that he doesn't know how to play very good yet.

75
00:05:57,520 --> 00:06:02,000
Yeah. It's a new song. He's really nervous about like whether the crowd's going to love it. And

76
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:07,040
he doesn't know how to like play the instrument good enough. And so he's like really focused on

77
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:10,080
that. And then all of a sudden you're behind him with a baseball bat with a bunch of nails in it.

78
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:12,640
And then you do toss him also another baseball bat.

79
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:19,680
So you're suggesting James rips into something from the third canon, which is what we call songs

80
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:26,400
after like 2005. He rips into the third canon, maybe like a math sucks or I will play for gumbo.

81
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:27,680
Sorry, there's one called math sucks?

82
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:29,680
Yeah, it's called math sucks.

83
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:33,840
Real quick, real quick, real quick. It's with a K by the way. No C just a K.

84
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:35,280
S U K S.

85
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:39,280
Perfect. Perfect. Real quick, quick, quick. How much did you pay for these tickets?

86
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:44,000
Like not much. We're on the lawn. So we're just kind of kicking it.

87
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:48,480
All right. That's actually, that's how it should be. I would be amazed if anybody actually bought

88
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:52,880
like the actual seats to sit. Like everyone's just like, oh, there's lawn. I can just sit on

89
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:54,720
grass. Yes, please.

90
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:57,840
That's the vibe right there. Who wants to sit in a chair? That's fine. You know,

91
00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:02,320
you could pay for the chair, but you're not going to need it. Once he, once he tears into the,

92
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:06,560
to the, some of his first cannon hits, you'll also be too stoned to sit down.

93
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:08,720
You won't remember how to do it.

94
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:12,640
And that's a bad place to be because that's, that leaves you very few options.

95
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:16,880
So have you considered if you do powder yourself up just right and you get,

96
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:23,200
he witnesses you, however you decide to do it, what you might do because you're growing

97
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:26,800
with your family, I imagine, right? As a family experience. What if he wants to kiss in my club to

98
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:34,320
you because he like, there's, oh, there's, there's plenty of hours in the day. I'll make him take me

99
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:38,720
to the plane first and let me fly it a little bit. Like, okay. You know, why didn't we done me,

100
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:44,320
Jim? Just so you know, it's, it's real. It's, uh, listen, that's I'll report back next week.

101
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:48,480
I was actually trying to engineer a way that I could record an episode at the concert.

102
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:52,480
I couldn't come up with anything substantial though. You realize how shitty that would be

103
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:57,280
for me and Travis though. Oh, the worst. I get my idea was like, I would barely pay attention to

104
00:07:57,280 --> 00:08:02,240
what you guys were saying and just check in every few minutes. Yeah. Like a live correspondent.

105
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:07,360
Well, you guys kind of held out in the fort. Um, but I really want to, this isn't about work

106
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:13,360
and it's, and you know what, in a way it's not even about me, this concert, it's, it's,

107
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:17,920
it's about James and him connected with his fans. Um, he's getting up in years and any tour could

108
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:22,240
be the last one before he retires. And I'm sure he's been saying that forever, but you know,

109
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:27,520
I'm just happy to have the opportunity to finally go see Jim live. Um, please let us know how it

110
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:31,680
goes. Oh, well, uh, here's our first question. Hey, but then bam, about two months ago I got

111
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:37,680
pulled over during my driver's test for pulling out in front. You got pulled over during your

112
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:43,840
driver's test as a bad beat as a bad, that's a whoof. Ouch. Uh, I normally don't drive this

113
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:48,080
poorly, but the cop who was giving the test made me nervous. How do I stay? That's why they got

114
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:53,520
pulled over. Everyone's going to be like, wow, how do I stay chill next time I take it? Wait a minute.

115
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:57,600
Okay. Okay. Okay. I think the cop, the cop that was giving the test, I think made them stop the

116
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:01,520
test because they pulled out in front of it. Yes. Sorry. Are there places where cops give driving

117
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:06,240
tests? That's terrifying. That's a fucking nightmare. Are you kidding me? You pulled out

118
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:11,440
in front of traffic doing a left turn, not a protect, I assume not a protect the left turn.

119
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:16,320
There's people honking, which is just terrifying. And there's a cop that is going like, nope.

120
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:21,040
The cop like, it looks like you pulled out in front of traffic also. Is that weed I smell on you

121
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:27,600
from two years ago? That's right. Nevermind the barking dog in the back. Yeah. Um, that's,

122
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:34,240
that's fucking terrifying. I, I like, oh man, I don't know that I could recover from this.

123
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:40,800
I, I, I don't know how to stay moved. Is moving to a different, is packing your bags and moving

124
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:47,040
to a state where you can just like take a test from just like some fucking who usually administers

125
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:56,240
these tests. Big fucking old nerd is like, well, it looks like you didn't hit the brakes a little

126
00:09:56,240 --> 00:10:01,760
bit fast enough, but that's okay. Cause I'm afraid of you. And so here's your license and not a cop.

127
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:08,080
And then you can move back to Arkansas, I suppose. Can you try to drive past a crime? So the cop is

128
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:14,640
like, hold on, pull over partner. And he tosses you a shotgun and it's like, let's get this done.

129
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:19,760
You've got to stop this crime. And then afterwards he's the rock. Yes, he's the rock. And this is the

130
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:26,720
rundown too. And also like after that, there's no way he's going to fail you. No way. No way.

131
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:33,920
You've been through some shit together. Oh, oh, oh, okay. Wait, marry the, you gotta marry the two

132
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:38,480
situations. The next time this happens, if you pull out in front of traffic, right? You make

133
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:45,280
another infraction and he's like, Ooh, that's an infraction. You say, no, I saw that person in that

134
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:52,080
car was doing something bad. They were, they were going to go murder someone and I had to stop them.

135
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:59,360
So what seemed like an infraction was actually me doing like a citizen's driving maneuver to stop

136
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:07,360
a future crime. It was a citizen's wreck. Yeah. You don't understand. I had to do it. I had a,

137
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:12,720
listen, I had a fucking premonition. Okay. Get off my case. Are you biased against psychics?

138
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:20,000
Here's one you could try. Psych could talk his way out of this, by the way. Psych could do anything.

139
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:23,520
Psych could talk his way out of this. With the help of his best friend, Dule Hill. So could

140
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:27,840
monk and also white collar. Characters welcome. Is there ever a crossover episode between

141
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:31,680
psych and monk and maybe white collar pops out at the end? Gotta be, gotta be. Oh God,

142
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:36,480
I want that so bad now. Please, please bring it back. Make the psych movie. Bring monk back.

143
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:41,360
Burn notice is there. At the end. Yeah. They try to solve the crime. They're like,

144
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:45,680
we need one more hand. Then burn notice shows up. What's up on burn notice? Characters welcome.

145
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:49,680
See you guys over on Royal pains. That's a different. Royal pains is there.

146
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:55,680
Could you tell, like, I think the problem that you're having here is the pressure to succeed.

147
00:11:55,680 --> 00:12:00,080
You need to find a way to release that. So I would say start going to these driving tests,

148
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:07,280
deciding to fail. And when you get into the car, tell the cop, hey, this run, this is a burner

149
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:12,160
test. I ain't going to pass this one. Hang on. I've already got a second appointment scheduled.

150
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:15,520
It's a confidence booster. I'm going to do. So I'm really going to explore the space out there.

151
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:20,080
And then you pop in your headphones, you play some music, baby driver, this shit,

152
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:22,960
which I still haven't seen, but I assume this is what happens.

153
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:27,600
There's all seem like good options. I'm glad we could help so much.

154
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:33,600
Or just like when you fuck up, just look at him and go, Poban, he's nerve and go for a high five.

155
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:37,520
And like, he'll be like, oh, you know, you fucked up, but that's really charming. Okay.

156
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:43,360
You're fine. You're fine. You still failed. I have a Yahoo here. It was sent in by a couple

157
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:47,520
people. Level 9,000. Yeah. Drew, Drew, Drew Davenport and Nick Potter. Thank you. Thank you.

158
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:57,200
Both. It's from Yaja answers user questions lost in time. The question is true or false.

159
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:02,080
You have fully explored your entire body at least once.

160
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:08,880
I will say, can I just say right off the bat? Yeah. Really think about it.

161
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:13,280
No, I'm just going to say just form out of the question. I'd like a Yahoo answer. That's like,

162
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:19,040
listen, you only got two answers. You don't got to get eloquent here. This is a yes or no,

163
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:26,560
true or false question. It really makes you confront like, this is my body. Obviously

164
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:35,840
we've been through a lot together. Swimming, walking, scrubbing, scrubbing it in the shower,

165
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:42,720
but is there parts of it I just don't know about. It's like when you're out in the woods and you're

166
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:48,080
like, you know, you think like this, this square foot of land I'm standing on, has any human ever

167
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:53,600
stood here before? Yeah. You know, has anyone walked, has a foot trod this, this mountain

168
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:57,440
or am I the first? And I think about that every time I touch the back of my knee,

169
00:13:57,440 --> 00:14:00,720
have I touched this inch of my body? That's what I'm saying. I don't think,

170
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:03,840
I don't know that I have. I'm thinking there's probably untread ground somewhere.

171
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:12,080
There, uh, my body is like, uh, an urban area by and large. There's a lot of culture and

172
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:18,960
exciting development, but there are some places, uh, in town that you just don't go. There's some

173
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:24,560
places in my body I'm just not, forget places, there's angles of my body. I'm like, ah, I don't

174
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:30,720
know. I don't know if that's, that one's for me. Mine has a lot of sprawl.

175
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:35,200
Let me say this. There's bodies, there's parts of my body that are so mixed areas that Roman

176
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:42,000
Mars has done an episode about them. Like it's, it's pretty, it's pretty well hidden from the, the,

177
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:48,080
it's like it's, it's at least 75% invisible. I would say that it's, it's, it's rough out there.

178
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:53,200
I just think about it. Hey, here's something weird. You guys ever think,

179
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:59,520
I was thinking about this yesterday that there's organs in your body that you won't see,

180
00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:04,240
but like you've been carrying them with you forever, but like you will never see

181
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:09,280
your heart or whatever. Like maybe through x-rays or MRIs or whatever, but like you,

182
00:15:09,280 --> 00:15:14,800
like you're just been hauling those things around with you and they could be weird or cool and you

183
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:19,760
just don't know. They're just kind of along for the ride with you forever locked away.

184
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:23,440
This is a, this is a thing I've thought about before, Justin, where like I've never had any

185
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:27,840
kind of, uh, like open my body surgery. I've never had any surgery. And I thought like,

186
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:32,080
what if they were to cut me open at like 45 and be like, what is that?

187
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:37,760
Yeah. And I just like, I, I'm like an ex man. Dude, your liver's all weird. Oh man.

188
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:41,280
I've got a whole nother organ in there that they've like never seen. It's just like,

189
00:15:41,280 --> 00:15:46,960
well, this is new. He's got stomach too. The sequel, the stomach.

190
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:50,720
This is why you could eat all those bagel sandwiches. That don't make sense.

191
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:54,720
It's like a cow stomach in here. It's a lot of chambers.

192
00:15:56,080 --> 00:16:01,120
I can have a perfect liver. I might have like the perfect liver and I'd never know.

193
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:05,200
I don't know. You like Hennessy a lot. That's true. No, I mean, not anymore.

194
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:09,920
The slow carb business, it's not compatible with pounding the Hennessy every night.

195
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:13,360
Now, Justin, I'm pretty sure at this point, as long as you've been doing slow carb,

196
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:17,680
if you ever did have some sort of surgery, it would just sort of be like a beanbag situation.

197
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:22,080
Just like a lot of pintos would just come just spilling, spilling out of you.

198
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:25,600
I hear the pintos shuffling around when you walk. I'm just saying.

199
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:31,200
It's gotten a little distracting for sure. A little bit. It's sort of a maraca situation.

200
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:34,560
Are there parts of your body you haven't explored?

201
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:37,760
Listen, we're all thinking about it. We're all dancing around it,

202
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:39,360
but there's probably a part of the...

203
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:42,480
I mean, the taint, right?

204
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:44,960
The taint, the gooch region, the back of it. Everyone's thinking about the taint.

205
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:48,080
Everybody's thinking about it. Here's something kind of fun.

206
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:55,600
I would be willing to bet $100 that 100% of the people listening to this episode have,

207
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:58,640
in the past three minutes, visualized their own taint.

208
00:16:58,640 --> 00:17:03,680
And they have probably thought about the last taint experience that they had,

209
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:05,840
and they're all visualizing their own taint.

210
00:17:05,840 --> 00:17:09,360
If you've visualized your own taint in the past three minutes, please tweet,

211
00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:12,720
I just visualized my own taint. Hashtag MBMBAM.

212
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:15,360
If you want to throw a link to the iTunes page, all the better.

213
00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:18,960
Oh, this will also be fun, because we also often get questions about this.

214
00:17:18,960 --> 00:17:24,000
If you're in a public setting, maybe on the subway,

215
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:27,520
or you're just walking down the street, right now, if you visualize your own taint,

216
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:31,040
just raise your hand, and if you see someone else,

217
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:34,560
like, oh, they raised their hand for no reason, just walking down the street, you'll know.

218
00:17:34,560 --> 00:17:35,840
That's how they'll know.

219
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:39,200
Yeah, you'll know, like, oh, okay, you're listening to my brother and my brother and me right now,

220
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:41,840
and you thought about your taint. Cool. And maybe high-five them.

221
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:48,480
And not only visualized it, thought about your history with it.

222
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:49,520
Yeah, for sure.

223
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:53,280
Have I been all over that? Have I Magellaned my taint?

224
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:56,160
Thought about the intricate setup of mirrors you once did.

225
00:17:57,680 --> 00:18:01,520
It's gotta be, it's gotta, you know what? No.

226
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:04,000
I've seen everything my body has to offer.

227
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:07,680
Next question.

228
00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:11,600
I picked up a pair of jeans one day and couldn't remember where I had bought them,

229
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:14,400
but they quickly became my favorite pair of jeans.

230
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:18,240
After wearing them a few times, it hit me that there's a chance they were my roommates,

231
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:20,480
and they ended up in my laundry by accident.

232
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:24,800
She hasn't said anything, and there's a chance I just forgot I bought them.

233
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:27,520
I checked, and we don't wear the same size,

234
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:30,400
but I also know that those are just justifications I'm using

235
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:33,600
to avoid possibly having to give up my favorite pair of jeans.

236
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:39,600
What should I do? That's from Potential Denim Deviant.

237
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:40,080
You're good.

238
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:42,560
You're fine.

239
00:18:42,560 --> 00:18:44,080
I really don't know what else to say.

240
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:47,600
It's good jeans, roommate doesn't care, it's not even the same size, you're good.

241
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:50,160
Traveling pants is the way to go though, Trav.

242
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:54,560
If you are ever caught, like I thought we were in the sisterhood together,

243
00:18:54,560 --> 00:19:01,280
and they may travel back to you at some point if I get some cheese stains on them,

244
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:04,160
but right now they've wandered long enough,

245
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:07,840
and they've found respite and shelter, and we gotta let them embrace that.

246
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:10,480
This is something I wish you could do with a roommate,

247
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:15,440
which is like, I'm traveling to Italy to go to a friend's wedding,

248
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:17,200
and it's going to be a difficult time for me,

249
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:22,560
so I stole some of your fucking pants because these are my traveling jeans.

250
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:25,360
I think that's what that movie, I think that's how it starts.

251
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:28,080
And this is our traveling wallet that I stole from you.

252
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:33,440
Yeah, guys, the sisterhood of the traveling identity.

253
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:36,560
The traveling social security number, what's the problem?

254
00:19:36,560 --> 00:19:38,720
Listen, I'm going to a wedding, it's going to be tough.

255
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:41,760
I bought a bunch of shit with your Amazon account, I had to deliver to my dad's place.

256
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:46,400
So they're fine, right?

257
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:47,520
Like, this is an easy one.

258
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:52,720
But I also think that there's a third more mysterious possibility here of like,

259
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:55,440
you don't remember buying them, but they're not your roommate's size,

260
00:19:55,440 --> 00:20:01,520
so like, there is a third option that it's neither yours nor your roommate's,

261
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:03,360
and like, where the fuck did they come from?

262
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:06,640
Sentient alien pretending to be jeans to get a bunch of bucks.

263
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:07,360
Oh my god.

264
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:07,680
Thank you, Justin.

265
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:09,040
These fucking perverts.

266
00:20:09,040 --> 00:20:10,800
I'm so sick of these genomorphs.

267
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:14,960
Thank you, and thank you, Philip K. Dick, for giving aliens the idea to do that.

268
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:18,080
I want to go ahead and give Griffin a bit of a moment here,

269
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:22,240
because usually it's mine, but Griffin did just say genomorph,

270
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:25,040
and like, I really want to hang a lantern on that.

271
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:25,600
Nothing.

272
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:27,520
I've been there, Griffin.

273
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:28,800
I know how that feels.

274
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:32,080
I know, Trav, and I just, it felt bad.

275
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:35,680
I'm sorry I do that to you so often.

276
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:41,600
You put up pearls before swine so frequently, and it just felt so shitty.

277
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:44,000
Yeah, no, that was, genomorph was great.

278
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,480
And don't get me wrong, I'm gonna keep doing it to you,

279
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:49,920
but like, in that envious moment, it just like, is weird.

280
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:54,160
No, when you got a rhythm like we have, it's okay if you shit on me from time to time.

281
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:57,920
Oh, by the way, genomorph is a really great roller derby name,

282
00:20:57,920 --> 00:21:00,720
if anyone wants to use that and be kind of like, alien themed.

283
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:03,760
I mean, I already TM'd it, so.

284
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:05,280
Oh, well, never mind.

285
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:06,640
How about another question?

286
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:10,160
Yeah, I recently discovered that my brother eats toaster waffles weird.

287
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:14,880
Instead of eating both waffles separately with some kind of spreadable food stuff or syrup,

288
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:17,600
he immediately takes the waffles after they've popped out from the toaster

289
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:20,960
and eats them without any accompanying butter, jam, marmalade, etc.

290
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:23,440
Furthermore, he holds them together as if they're sandwich slices

291
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:27,520
without any actual filling, taking large bites out of both dry waffles at a time.

292
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:29,600
How do I communicate to him that he's doing this wrong,

293
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:31,760
or is it weird that I find this weird?

294
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:34,080
And that's from Whacked Out by Waffle Weirdness.

295
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:38,720
When y'all started this show, when we started this show,

296
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:44,560
did you think it would turn into a internet forum

297
00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:48,400
for us to learn about all the different types of perverts that there are in the world?

298
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:54,720
Because I didn't think it would be that, but that's certainly where we are.

299
00:21:56,160 --> 00:21:57,200
I'm into this.

300
00:21:57,760 --> 00:21:59,440
I've done exactly this.

301
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:01,760
I enjoy, if I'm going to make a toaster waffle,

302
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:04,080
I just want to wrap it in a paper towel and go to town.

303
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:06,080
I don't want a bunch of accoutrement.

304
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:07,120
Here's what it is.

305
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:10,800
Here's what it is, Justin, because I felt this way as well,

306
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:15,600
which is I think the brother in question here has recognized like,

307
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:18,160
I'm not having a gourmet dinner.

308
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:22,640
I am getting two frozen toaster waffles because if I don't eat, I'll die.

309
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:26,000
And this is function more than form.

310
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:29,040
I just need to consume this food as quickly as possible

311
00:22:29,040 --> 00:22:34,000
so I can continue on with my day so that I don't get cranky around 1130.

312
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,200
Now I want to hit you with this Griffin,

313
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:37,360
because you were sort of turning your nose up at this.

314
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:39,680
Does it change the math at all for you?

315
00:22:39,680 --> 00:22:41,280
I don't eat plain waffles.

316
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:45,280
If I'm going to eat a toaster waffle, I like them with some fixings.

317
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:47,680
So right now I've got Spiderman waffles

318
00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:50,400
and they have blue and red berries in them and they're shaped like webs.

319
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:53,040
And full of spiders, just like lots of spiders.

320
00:22:53,040 --> 00:22:54,640
One bite, spiders in your mouth.

321
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:55,680
It's fantastic.

322
00:22:55,680 --> 00:22:56,800
Spider in every bite.

323
00:22:56,800 --> 00:22:57,840
Guaranteed.

324
00:22:57,840 --> 00:22:58,480
Guaranteed.

325
00:22:58,480 --> 00:22:59,840
So does that change it for you?

326
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:03,920
If it's like a sweet treat with berries in it to just eat it dry,

327
00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:04,720
does that bother you?

328
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:12,880
I wasn't imagining just like a flax fucking plain flavorless waffle.

329
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:14,320
I'll tell you what freaks me out.

330
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:18,960
It's the combination of no accoutrement, no syrups,

331
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:22,000
no peanut butters or jellies or jams or butters,

332
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:25,120
and also eating them two at a time.

333
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:28,400
Like to quote this amazing turn of phrase from the question,

334
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:29,600
sandwich slices.

335
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:32,160
I just like that.

336
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:33,200
Doing both to me,

337
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:35,520
eating it like it's a sandwich with nothing in the middle

338
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:38,480
is ludicrous to me.

339
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:39,840
It's beyond the pale.

340
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:42,560
I cannot forgive it or get over it.

341
00:23:42,560 --> 00:23:47,760
What if I told you that this brother Griffin was an EMT

342
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:50,240
who had to get out there and save lives

343
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:54,320
and doesn't have time to put butter on the waffle and syrup

344
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:55,920
and enjoy it like you.

345
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:58,720
Like you, they're out there saving lives.

346
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:05,280
If you're gonna eat two waffles and you can eat them both

347
00:24:05,280 --> 00:24:09,200
in a time it takes you to eat one through stacking technology,

348
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:12,640
it seems irresponsible not to.

349
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:14,080
Yes, I mean, you're fucking,

350
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:17,680
but now you're on some like bullshit Silicon Valley stuff

351
00:24:17,680 --> 00:24:19,440
of just like, you don't have got time to eat.

352
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:21,120
You got to program Facebook too.

353
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:24,080
So here's a protein slurry that we can shoot into your mouth

354
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:24,880
with a big gun.

355
00:24:25,680 --> 00:24:27,520
No, you gotta take time and enjoy your life.

356
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:28,640
You're an EMT, that's fine.

357
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:29,840
You get out there and save lives,

358
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:31,440
but save your own life first

359
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:32,800
because what's life worth living

360
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:35,040
if you don't eat your waffles one at a fucking time

361
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:36,800
with the syrup and stuff.

362
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:39,520
Aren't there some days where a scientist like knocked

363
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:41,920
on your door and said, eat this pill

364
00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:44,160
and you won't need to eat for the next 24 hours

365
00:24:44,160 --> 00:24:45,520
and you'll get all the nutrients you need

366
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:47,600
and you'll feel totally full and satisfied

367
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:50,080
and you'll like be able to like really focus

368
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:52,080
on getting shit done today.

369
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:52,720
What the fuck?

370
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:55,040
Not every day, not every day.

371
00:24:55,920 --> 00:24:57,440
Eating's the best.

372
00:24:57,440 --> 00:24:59,440
Eating's my favorite.

373
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:01,280
I saw that in an episode of Garfield

374
00:25:01,280 --> 00:25:02,800
when we went to the future

375
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:04,880
and everybody was eating food pills.

376
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:05,840
And what was the lesson you learned?

377
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:06,560
What was the lesson you learned?

378
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:09,440
Because I bet he was like, what about my lasagna?

379
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:10,480
That's what he was like.

380
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:12,480
He was like, fuck this, I'm going back to the past.

381
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:16,640
It was the first time that the F word was used on TV.

382
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:18,480
And it was very unscripted.

383
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:19,360
It was live.

384
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:20,480
Griffin, you have to remember,

385
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:22,160
and I don't know if you're old enough to remember this.

386
00:25:22,160 --> 00:25:25,840
I grew up in a house where I once watched my dad

387
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:27,680
eat a pop tart with butter on it.

388
00:25:27,680 --> 00:25:29,600
Like he put butter on a pop tart.

389
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:32,320
So it's like very hard to sort of trip me out

390
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:33,840
with breakfast methodology.

391
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:37,840
I guess it's just, it's just slow down y'all.

392
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:40,960
You only get one go, put some syrup on some shit.

393
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:41,760
That's it.

394
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:42,800
That's all I'm gonna say.

395
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:45,760
We get one go, yolo, syrup your shit up.

396
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:48,560
What if it was a syrup sandwich?

397
00:25:48,560 --> 00:25:49,840
What is that?

398
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:50,960
What have you just said?

399
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:52,800
Two waffles, syrup in the middle,

400
00:25:52,800 --> 00:25:54,960
squish it together, syrup sandwich.

401
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:57,440
It's gonna be a mess, but it's better than nothing.

402
00:25:57,440 --> 00:26:00,560
What if you made like syrup infused butter?

403
00:26:00,560 --> 00:26:02,160
I don't do that much syrup on my shit anymore.

404
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:05,040
Actually, I'm more of a peanut butter and jam kind of man

405
00:26:05,040 --> 00:26:09,120
because one time it was just when we had gotten Cecil,

406
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:11,920
our cat, I put some syrup on a waffle

407
00:26:11,920 --> 00:26:12,880
and it slipped off my plate

408
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:14,720
and landed on the cat syrup side down.

409
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:16,520
I hate that.

410
00:26:16,520 --> 00:26:17,840
Sticky kitty.

411
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:19,920
That cat fucking hates my guts still.

412
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:21,200
And it's because of that.

413
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:22,480
And I don't blame him.

414
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:23,760
I don't blame him.

415
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:25,040
What a shitty day.

416
00:26:25,040 --> 00:26:26,720
Waffles are kind of bullshit.

417
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:30,560
The first time the inventor of the waffle, Ed Waffle,

418
00:26:30,560 --> 00:26:35,600
invented it, the first time he tried to spread butter on it,

419
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:38,080
he should have gone back to the fucking drawing board

420
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:40,240
and just said like, this didn't work out.

421
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:43,440
I just tried it and like, this didn't work.

422
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:45,200
You guys, are you ready?

423
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:46,480
Are you ready for my new invention

424
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:47,440
that I've just come up with?

425
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:50,560
Waffle iron, smooth on one side for the butter,

426
00:26:50,560 --> 00:26:52,080
waffled on the other for the syrup.

427
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:52,880
Oh my God.

428
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:53,280
Holy shit.

429
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:55,200
Oh my God.

430
00:26:56,160 --> 00:26:58,400
It's just like, yeah, choose your own adventure.

431
00:26:58,400 --> 00:26:59,920
That's so good, Trav.

432
00:26:59,920 --> 00:27:04,400
You spread the butter onto the flat side

433
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:07,120
and then you flip it and dip it

434
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:09,360
and then you fill every one of those crannies

435
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:10,800
with that golden juice.

436
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:13,440
Oh my God, this is good, Travis.

437
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:14,640
I'm so, wow.

438
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:16,800
Wow, that's good.

439
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:18,320
Name it so you can TM it real quick.

440
00:27:20,160 --> 00:27:20,720
Falafel.

441
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:23,360
Okay, it's a flat waffle.

442
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:24,720
No, you fucked up.

443
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:25,520
Oh, damn it.

444
00:27:27,040 --> 00:27:29,600
Can I just, breakfast friend.

445
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:30,640
Breakfast friend.

446
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:32,080
The name of the tool is the breakfast friend.

447
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:33,040
A little general.

448
00:27:34,160 --> 00:27:35,680
If I buy something called a breakfast friend

449
00:27:35,680 --> 00:27:39,120
and it does this one thing, it's not a great friend.

450
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:42,480
It's just sort of like a very single-minded friend.

451
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:46,080
Future waffle love sounds.

452
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:52,160
Travis McRoy presents waffle friend.

453
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:55,840
A Travis McRoy joint.

454
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:59,920
So what about waffle box, the pancake below?

455
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:03,360
Yeah, waffle box, the pancake below is really, really good.

456
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:03,840
Okay.

457
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:04,960
Spider-Man waffles.

458
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:07,200
Those are used.

459
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:09,280
Groot waffles.

460
00:28:09,280 --> 00:28:10,480
I am Groot waffles.

461
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:11,760
Everybody loves that little guy.

462
00:28:12,800 --> 00:28:13,440
Groffles.

463
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:14,560
Groffles.

464
00:28:14,560 --> 00:28:15,600
Janine Groffles.

465
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:20,960
And it comes with a cereal like Cheerios

466
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:22,560
and that's the O's that you pour on top.

467
00:28:22,560 --> 00:28:26,000
Why didn't Janine Groffle ever get her own cereal?

468
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:27,200
It's not too late.

469
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:30,160
Janine Groffle's tasty waffles.

470
00:28:30,160 --> 00:28:33,280
And it's just like it's waffles with her Cheerios.

471
00:28:33,280 --> 00:28:35,200
Can we call him Mark Groffle-O's?

472
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:37,040
She's just wearing a chef's outfit.

473
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:41,200
Hi, I'm Mark Groffle-O and this is my partner Janine Groffle-O

474
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:44,640
and we want to present to you Groffle-O and Groffle-O's waffles.

475
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:50,320
Coming, coming this fall.

476
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:51,040
Look forward to it.

477
00:28:51,040 --> 00:28:52,720
It's my new potato chip brand.

478
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:54,480
It is just called Groffle-O's.

479
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:55,360
It's not as good.

480
00:28:56,720 --> 00:28:58,800
I came up with it early and I'm in debt.

481
00:28:59,680 --> 00:29:00,960
We need to talk about it.

482
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:02,320
I think that's all the jokes.

483
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:04,720
We're going to have to fund these new inventions somehow.

484
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:18,000
So let's take a trip on down to the money town.

485
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,800
I would like to tell you all about our sponsor this week.

486
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:22,960
One of them, Squarespace.

487
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:25,120
I have on Squarespace right now,

488
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:28,400
I think four or five different websites I've set up there.

489
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:30,160
It's so easy and convenient.

490
00:29:30,160 --> 00:29:32,560
Just started a new project with my friends here in Cincinnati

491
00:29:32,560 --> 00:29:35,680
where we're doing like a puzzle bar crawl

492
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:38,640
where you move from bar to bar and get different puzzles

493
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:39,840
to tell you the next place to go.

494
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:40,800
That sounds fun.

495
00:29:40,800 --> 00:29:42,800
Yeah, and I set up a website on Squarespace

496
00:29:42,800 --> 00:29:44,160
with the registration.

497
00:29:44,160 --> 00:29:46,080
You can pay the registration fee through there,

498
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:46,960
find all the information.

499
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:48,720
I even was able to set up puzzles

500
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:51,840
where you have to enter the answer to get to the next page.

501
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:56,080
It's really cool and it's so user-friendly

502
00:29:56,080 --> 00:29:57,920
and their support is amazing.

503
00:29:57,920 --> 00:29:59,840
You have 24 seven customer support.

504
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:02,640
There's nothing to install, patch, upgrade ever.

505
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:04,880
It's just amazing award-winning templates

506
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:06,240
and an all-in-one platform.

507
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:10,960
I highly recommend you can also get your domains

508
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:12,880
right through Squarespace.

509
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:15,280
So it's an all-in-one experience.

510
00:30:15,280 --> 00:30:18,240
And for a free trial and 10% off your first purchase,

511
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:22,080
you can visit squarespace.com slash my brother.

512
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:24,240
That's squarespace.com slash my brother.

513
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:25,040
Go check it out.

514
00:30:25,040 --> 00:30:26,320
I'm a huge fan.

515
00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:29,120
I also wanna say I went to roundzone.com once.

516
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:32,240
To try to get a website, gave my computer a big virus.

517
00:30:33,280 --> 00:30:36,000
You may not spend a lot of time thinking about your taint,

518
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:39,040
but your taint knows you so well.

519
00:30:39,040 --> 00:30:39,680
You know why?

520
00:30:39,680 --> 00:30:44,080
Because you take the time to give it the very best

521
00:30:44,080 --> 00:30:46,320
when you go to MeUndies.

522
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:51,280
MeUndies is sustainably sourced and made from micromodal.

523
00:30:51,280 --> 00:30:53,920
It's a fabric that's three times softer than cotton,

524
00:30:53,920 --> 00:30:56,960
which your taint certainly appreciates.

525
00:30:56,960 --> 00:31:00,160
You know, I'm gonna put a limit, four more times.

526
00:31:00,160 --> 00:31:01,360
Four more times.

527
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:03,760
You can try MeUndies today, and you should.

528
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:06,400
Go get the celebrate pattern before they're all gone

529
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:09,120
at MeUndies.com slash my brother.

530
00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:11,280
I should mention the celebrate pattern,

531
00:31:11,280 --> 00:31:13,760
it looks like confetti and it's fun.

532
00:31:13,760 --> 00:31:14,880
It's real fun.

533
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:16,320
It's fun.

534
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:17,440
If you go to that address I gave you,

535
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:19,200
MeUndies.com slash my brother,

536
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:22,000
you'll save 20% off your first pair.

537
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,640
So that makes affordable undies even more so.

538
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:27,360
You can get 20% off your first pair plus free shipping

539
00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:30,480
at MeUndies.com slash my brother right now.

540
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:33,760
That's MeUndies.com slash my brother.

541
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:34,320
I'm wearing those,

542
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:36,320
I don't know if y'all are down on this experience,

543
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:38,160
those MeUndies lounge pants right now.

544
00:31:38,160 --> 00:31:38,880
Fuck me.

545
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:41,200
It's just like a big pair of MeUndies that are pants also.

546
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:42,560
And I gotta get into those.

547
00:31:42,560 --> 00:31:43,200
They're real good.

548
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:44,320
Hey, can I tell you about wink?

549
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:44,800
Please do.

550
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:46,160
I'm gonna do it real quick.

551
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:47,920
Do you hear that?

552
00:31:47,920 --> 00:31:49,040
That was the sound of my,

553
00:31:49,040 --> 00:31:50,720
that's the sound I make when I wink.

554
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:51,520
Oh God.

555
00:31:51,520 --> 00:31:53,760
Yeah, they say to do it.

556
00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:54,560
Huh.

557
00:31:54,560 --> 00:31:55,360
Do that.

558
00:31:55,360 --> 00:31:56,320
Go to a doctor.

559
00:31:57,680 --> 00:32:01,440
Formerly, you may know this project formerly as Club W.

560
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:03,280
It gives you access to exceptional wines

561
00:32:03,280 --> 00:32:04,960
from around the world.

562
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:07,040
They base the wines that they send you

563
00:32:07,040 --> 00:32:08,400
on your taste preferences

564
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:10,080
and will introduce you to new custom wines

565
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:11,680
that are not available anywhere else.

566
00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:14,080
We've gotten a few bottles from them before

567
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:17,440
and I'm not like a huge wine drinker.

568
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:18,560
I enjoy drinking wine.

569
00:32:18,560 --> 00:32:20,880
I just like don't know how to get good stuff.

570
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:22,480
Like I don't know what is good

571
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:24,000
because I'm a child.

572
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:24,880
But all the stuff they send

573
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:26,000
has been like really, really great.

574
00:32:26,800 --> 00:32:27,680
You can join for free,

575
00:32:27,680 --> 00:32:29,520

and they have a 100% satisfaction guarantee.

578
00:32:32,160 --> 00:32:33,840
So you never pay for a bottle you don't like.

579
00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:37,200
You can just go to trywink.com

580
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:41,280
and that is spelled T-R-Y-W-I-N-C.

581
00:32:41,280 --> 00:32:43,760
It's wink with a C.com

582
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:46,160
and take a brief palette profile quiz

583
00:32:46,160 --> 00:32:47,680
and wink will recommend wines

584
00:32:47,680 --> 00:32:48,560

00:32:48,560 --> 00:32:50,320
to be shipped directly to your door every month.

00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:51,840

Trywink.com slash my brother.

595
00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:09,760
We got some personal messages here.

596
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:12,560
First is for Geekly Con.

597
00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:15,760
It's a weekend long gathering of friends

598
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:18,960
who love podcasts, tabletop gaming, video games.

599
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:20,240
I like those things.

600
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:21,680
And generally having fun.

601
00:33:21,680 --> 00:33:24,960
In 2017, Geekly Con will be in St. Louis

602
00:33:26,160 --> 00:33:29,360
from July 20th to the 23rd.

603
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:32,480
Geek me in St. Louis, Louis.

604
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:33,120
It's a little joke.

605
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:35,440
Very little.

606
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:39,600
Geekly Con is an open-minded and welcoming group

607
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:42,400
and we invite you to come and meet your new best friends.

608
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:44,400
Now tickets are selling fast

609
00:33:44,400 --> 00:33:46,800
so you're gonna wanna go to geeklycon.com

610
00:33:46,800 --> 00:33:50,240
to order one before they are sold out.

611
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:52,240
This will be a great event

612
00:33:54,320 --> 00:33:55,760
and I think everybody should go.

613
00:33:55,760 --> 00:33:59,120
Michael, the guy who's done so much web design for us

614
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:02,400
over the years, puts it on and he's a real sweetheart.

615
00:34:02,400 --> 00:34:05,200
So you should go check it totally out.

616
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:07,360
Geeklycon.com.

617
00:34:08,240 --> 00:34:10,560
I have a personal message here and it's for Adam.

618
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:12,640
Happy birthday to my favorite husband.

619
00:34:12,640 --> 00:34:15,040
And it's from Tabitha, your favorite wife.

620
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:17,920
This is the first time I think anybody using a Jumbotron

621
00:34:17,920 --> 00:34:21,360
has ever snuck a secret message into the name field.

622
00:34:21,360 --> 00:34:23,200
It's like that great 1-800 collect commercial

623
00:34:23,200 --> 00:34:25,360
where the guy's like, we oughta baby it's a boy.

624
00:34:25,360 --> 00:34:26,080
You remember that one?

625
00:34:27,120 --> 00:34:28,320
Yeah, I do actually.

626
00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:30,720
Oh God, why do I remember that?

627
00:34:31,360 --> 00:34:32,880
We oughta baby it's a boy.

628
00:34:32,880 --> 00:34:34,720
I can't remember my wife's phone number

629
00:34:34,720 --> 00:34:36,000
but I can remember that commercial.

630
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:36,640
What's wrong with me?

631
00:34:36,640 --> 00:34:37,600
Same dude, same.

632
00:34:37,600 --> 00:34:38,480
So funny.

633
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:41,200
Anyway, Adam, Tabitha has this message for you.

634
00:34:41,200 --> 00:34:44,080
Thanks for sticking with me through all my podcast obsessions

635
00:34:44,080 --> 00:34:45,600
and even joining me in some.

636
00:34:45,600 --> 00:34:46,960
I couldn't think of anything better

637
00:34:48,160 --> 00:34:50,320
than to have the brothers wish you a great year.

638
00:34:51,200 --> 00:34:52,720
You're always supportive and kind

639
00:34:52,720 --> 00:34:55,440
even with a grumpy, that's just my face, face

640
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:57,200
and a sigh, winky emoticon.

641
00:34:58,240 --> 00:34:59,680
That's the sound it makes again, I'm sorry.

642
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:04,000
PS, I'm buying this on my bday since they opened 2017 today.

643
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:04,960
Now that's love.

644
00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:06,640
What a love.

645
00:35:07,600 --> 00:35:08,480
What a love.

646
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:10,240
What an exceptional love.

647
00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:13,200
Buying somebody a birthday present on your dang birthday.

648
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:15,040
That is such an amount of foresight

649
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:17,440
that I cannot even comprehend.

650
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:18,480
I do it every year.

651
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:23,760
We oughta baby, it's a boy.

652
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:24,320
So good.

653
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:27,520
I'm so glad we could bring that great gag to a new generation.

654
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:30,640
Hello, Amita Patel.

655
00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:32,400
Hello, Sean David Johnson.

656
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:33,520
What's going on?

657
00:35:33,520 --> 00:35:34,880
I think a friend of mine may have

658
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:37,360
chronic pop culture deficiency syndrome.

659
00:35:37,360 --> 00:35:40,480
Oh no, PCDS, what are the symptoms?

660
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:43,040
Well, she doesn't know Wakanda from Westeros.

661
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:43,680
Shameful.

662
00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:47,040
And she keeps confusing Aziz Ansari and Riz Ahmed.

663
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:48,320
Oh my gosh, so sad.

664
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:51,760
Kinda racist too, but what did you tell her to do?

665
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:55,200
I told her to listen to our podcast, Inside Pop, of course.

666
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:56,640
Fantastic idea.

667
00:35:56,640 --> 00:35:59,280
A weekly dose of Inside Pop will help anyone discover

668
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:01,600
the best in TV, film, and music.

669
00:36:01,600 --> 00:36:03,920
Suffer from PCDS no more.

670
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:06,480
Inside Pop has you covered every Wednesday on Max Fun.

671
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:08,800
How about a Yahoo, please?

672
00:36:10,080 --> 00:36:11,440
This one was sent in by Level 9000,

673
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:13,440
Yahoo Drew, Drew Davenport, thank you, Drew.

674
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:15,520
It's from Yahoo Answers user, Max Tyler.

675
00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:18,240
Sometimes I can sense a smile in you

676
00:36:18,240 --> 00:36:20,960
when you begin to read these, and I always get very excited.

677
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:22,080
They're just really good.

678
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:25,200
In a war between sin towers...

679
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:27,040
Why did I say it like that?

680
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:31,280
I figured it was misspelled, and you were giving the person shit.

681
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:32,320
Sin towers.

682
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:33,280
Sin towers.

683
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:35,840
You're saying them sin towers in Munich.

684
00:36:35,840 --> 00:36:40,880
In a war between sin towers and men on horses, who would win?

685
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:42,800
By the way, it would be in a fantasy world

686
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:45,280
with swords, spears, bows, and arrows,

687
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:46,960
and such like, thanks in advance.

688
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:48,560
This question is fucking on point.

689
00:36:49,360 --> 00:36:51,280
Okay, I really, I'm not gonna just start.

690
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:53,440
Let's not do the thing we always do

691
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:55,600
where we just start running our fucking mouths

692
00:36:55,600 --> 00:36:57,200
before we actually think about it.

693
00:36:57,200 --> 00:36:58,960
We're gonna take, I'm sorry, listener,

694
00:36:58,960 --> 00:37:02,720
perhaps you have a 15 second skip button on your player.

695
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:04,480
Let's give ourselves 15 seconds

696
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:06,800
to just fucking think about this for a second.

697
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:08,960
I have a bit of filler for the audience

698
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:10,880
to think about while we think about it.

699
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:13,280
Do you think the first time a centaur

700
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:15,920
sees a person on horseback get off the horse,

701
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:17,600
they just start screaming in terror?

702
00:37:17,600 --> 00:37:18,560
That would be very scary.

703
00:37:18,560 --> 00:37:21,360
All right, shut your fucking gob and think about this.

704
00:37:21,360 --> 00:37:22,560
Think about it, ready, go.

705
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:28,160
I've got my, I got my answer.

706
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:31,200
Okay, okay, I think I'm ready.

707
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:32,400
I'm ready too.

708
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:38,160
Three, two, one, men on horses.

709
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:39,440
Yeah, okay, okay, okay.

710
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:41,200
And here's how I came to this conclusion.

711
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:45,360
Centaurs is one big, beautiful beast,

712
00:37:45,360 --> 00:37:48,320
and don't get me wrong, big, beautiful beast, love it.

713
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:51,600
And there's certainly a thing you can put in the pro column

714
00:37:51,600 --> 00:37:55,280
of just like full synthesis.

715
00:37:55,280 --> 00:37:56,720
Full integration.

716
00:37:56,720 --> 00:37:57,920
Full integration.

717
00:37:57,920 --> 00:37:59,760
You're gonna have, there's going to be,

718
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:02,560
even the most beautiful domesticated horse

719
00:38:02,560 --> 00:38:05,920
with the most beautiful connection with a jockey,

720
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:07,920
even if they're in the fucking drift together,

721
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:08,720
there's gonna be some.

722
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:10,880
Yeah, you've petted them every time they've turned left

723
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:12,240
or stopped for you at the right time.

724
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:13,520
You know what I mean?

725
00:38:13,520 --> 00:38:15,520
All the hearts exploded around their heads.

726
00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:17,120
There's a break point there

727
00:38:17,120 --> 00:38:19,680
of just how good that relationship can be.

728
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:23,040
There's a loss of control there somewhere.

729
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:24,960
But the thing I just can't get over

730
00:38:25,600 --> 00:38:27,200
is centaurs have one hit point

731
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:28,880
and a man and a horse have two.

732
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:32,240
Yeah, it's hard to deny that if you take out

733
00:38:32,240 --> 00:38:35,360
a centaur's legs, then it's done.

734
00:38:35,360 --> 00:38:38,080
If you take out the man on a horseback's legs,

735
00:38:38,080 --> 00:38:42,560
he's got another sort of methodology he can employ.

736
00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:44,160
I was thinking of spears, right?

737
00:38:44,160 --> 00:38:45,840
You throw a spear through a centaur,

738
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:48,240
you've hit the centaur.

739
00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:50,960
You would have to throw that spear really good

740
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:53,360
to get it through dude and horse.

741
00:38:53,360 --> 00:38:54,400
You know what I mean?

742
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:56,320
Now here's the question though, Griffin.

743
00:38:56,320 --> 00:39:00,080
In that case, if the centaur takes out person,

744
00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:02,800
is the horse like, I'm gonna keep fighting?

745
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:05,200
Or is the horse like, thank God, bye.

746
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:07,200
Wow, this is actually a fucking great point

747
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:13,200
because this gets back to that animal rider synthesis.

748
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:18,000
If the man is killed, does horse continue the fight?

749
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:20,320
I think that takes a special kind of horse.

750
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:23,440
So like a really, just a murder sea biscuit,

751
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:25,360
a murder biscuit, if you will.

752
00:39:25,360 --> 00:39:27,040
What is the horse gonna do?

753
00:39:27,040 --> 00:39:30,480
Like, oh, well, Daryl's down.

754
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:33,200
I guess I'll go eat all their oats

755
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:35,200
so they won't have any for later.

756
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:37,040
I'm gonna burn their homes.

757
00:39:37,040 --> 00:39:37,920
Whoa, horse.

758
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:39,600
What you just said is racist.

759
00:39:39,600 --> 00:39:40,800
That centaurs would eat oats.

760
00:39:41,360 --> 00:39:42,240
Actually, you know it's not

761
00:39:42,240 --> 00:39:43,440
because I eat oats sometimes.

762
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:44,480
Yeah, thank you.

763
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:47,040
Yeah, everybody likes oats except for me

764
00:39:47,040 --> 00:39:48,080
who only eats beans.

765
00:39:51,360 --> 00:39:52,960
Now if the horse ate all my beans,

766
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:54,320
then we'd have a fucking issue.

767
00:39:54,320 --> 00:39:55,360
Yeah, you'd have a real problem.

768
00:39:57,360 --> 00:39:58,480
This is a fucking good point.

769
00:39:58,480 --> 00:40:00,400
I think this might change the equation a little bit.

770
00:40:03,520 --> 00:40:05,440
If you get a centaur and the horse meat,

771
00:40:06,240 --> 00:40:07,360
then I think they might be able

772
00:40:07,360 --> 00:40:08,960
to keep going a little bit, right?

773
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:11,920
There's very little meat I have

774
00:40:11,920 --> 00:40:13,920
that if attacked with a big spear,

775
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:16,000
I could keep the fire.

776
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:16,880
You know what I mean?

777
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:20,800
But a centaur, there's a lot of extra stuff on there.

778
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:22,160
Shit, because if you take me out,

779
00:40:22,160 --> 00:40:23,120
my horse is done.

780
00:40:23,120 --> 00:40:25,440
My horse isn't gonna do anything to a centaur.

781
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:25,940
Yeah.

782
00:40:25,940 --> 00:40:29,620
And also, you do have to get into the question

783
00:40:29,620 --> 00:40:32,740
of where the centaur is keeping their vital organs.

784
00:40:32,740 --> 00:40:37,220
Because if it's all in the human section,

785
00:40:37,220 --> 00:40:38,900
then you could just keep taking arrows

786
00:40:38,900 --> 00:40:41,620
to the horse meat and like brush it off.

787
00:40:41,620 --> 00:40:42,740
Your horse takes one arrow.

788
00:40:42,740 --> 00:40:43,540
He's gonna be like,

789
00:40:43,540 --> 00:40:45,140
actually, I've thought about it.

790
00:40:45,140 --> 00:40:46,740
Um, fuck all you guys.

791
00:40:46,740 --> 00:40:48,020
I'm actually leaving.

792
00:40:48,020 --> 00:40:48,740
Goodbye.

793
00:40:48,740 --> 00:40:49,300
I'm sorry.

794
00:40:49,300 --> 00:40:52,020
I know we're two souls intertwined

795
00:40:52,020 --> 00:40:54,340
in the most magical relationship possible,

796
00:40:54,340 --> 00:40:55,380
but I actually am gonna go ahead

797
00:40:55,380 --> 00:40:56,900
and dip because this sucks.

798
00:40:56,900 --> 00:40:57,460
This sucks.

799
00:40:57,460 --> 00:40:58,260
I'm out of here.

800
00:41:00,420 --> 00:41:02,420
Here's a Yahoo Answers user, Robin,

801
00:41:03,060 --> 00:41:07,700
whose profile image is just the word Irish says,

802
00:41:08,260 --> 00:41:10,500
centaurs would win because they can use

803
00:41:10,500 --> 00:41:12,740
the bow and arrows better than humans can.

804
00:41:13,300 --> 00:41:15,380
That's if there was a real war

805
00:41:15,380 --> 00:41:16,740
between centaurs versus human,

806
00:41:16,740 --> 00:41:17,540
they would all be dead.

807
00:41:18,900 --> 00:41:19,780
Don't even think about the fact

808
00:41:19,780 --> 00:41:20,820
that centaurs would be better

809
00:41:20,820 --> 00:41:21,700
with the bow and arrows.

810
00:41:23,380 --> 00:41:24,820
You cannot bring in those facts.

811
00:41:24,820 --> 00:41:26,740
We do not know what kind of training

812
00:41:27,300 --> 00:41:28,820
anybody has in this.

813
00:41:28,820 --> 00:41:30,660
That has to be a zero something.

814
00:41:31,460 --> 00:41:33,220
Is there something about the integration

815
00:41:33,220 --> 00:41:34,500
of human and horse that makes them

816
00:41:34,500 --> 00:41:35,780
inherently better at archery?

817
00:41:35,780 --> 00:41:36,580
I'm confused.

818
00:41:36,580 --> 00:41:40,020
I know that lore wise,

819
00:41:40,020 --> 00:41:41,460
centaurs are amazing archers,

820
00:41:41,460 --> 00:41:42,420
but I'm talking like,

821
00:41:46,180 --> 00:41:47,780
we're talking about a real war here.

822
00:41:47,780 --> 00:41:48,260
You know what I mean?

823
00:41:48,260 --> 00:41:49,140
Not some fantasy war.

824
00:41:49,140 --> 00:41:51,540
We're talking about real centaurs, okay?

825
00:41:51,540 --> 00:41:52,040
Yeah.

826
00:41:52,040 --> 00:41:55,720
Yeah, I think I've changed my answer.

827
00:41:55,720 --> 00:41:56,440
Okay, wait a minute.

828
00:41:56,440 --> 00:41:58,200
We're talking about a war,

829
00:41:58,200 --> 00:42:00,520
not a battle, not a skirmish, a war.

830
00:42:03,400 --> 00:42:05,400
Look at the Civil War, right?

831
00:42:05,400 --> 00:42:08,120
Look at how important predicting

832
00:42:08,120 --> 00:42:10,280
troop movement was in that war,

833
00:42:10,280 --> 00:42:12,840
and it led to several lopsided battles

834
00:42:13,560 --> 00:42:15,480
and predicting where the enemy was gonna be.

835
00:42:15,480 --> 00:42:16,680
I'm sure that's true for any war.

836
00:42:16,680 --> 00:42:18,600
I've just read more books about the Civil War.

837
00:42:18,600 --> 00:42:24,440
So if you can assume that centaurs are going to be more mobile

838
00:42:24,440 --> 00:42:30,520
and going to be able to sort of be in other places

839
00:42:30,520 --> 00:42:32,200
like faster than the humans,

840
00:42:33,800 --> 00:42:36,040
like in terms of troop formation

841
00:42:36,040 --> 00:42:38,520
and sort of moving your resources around,

842
00:42:38,520 --> 00:42:41,720
the centaurs might actually have an advantage there.

843
00:42:41,720 --> 00:42:44,200
Oh shit, not only that, Justin,

844
00:42:44,200 --> 00:42:45,960
but speaking of resources,

845
00:42:45,960 --> 00:42:47,800
you only gotta feed a centaur once.

846
00:42:47,800 --> 00:42:48,760
Yes, exactly.

847
00:42:48,760 --> 00:42:50,520
You gotta feed a dude and a horse separately.

848
00:42:50,520 --> 00:42:51,640
That's double the food.

849
00:42:51,640 --> 00:42:51,960
Fuck.

850
00:42:51,960 --> 00:42:52,520
Okay.

851
00:42:52,520 --> 00:42:54,840
And centaurs are probably just eating apples, so.

852
00:42:55,480 --> 00:42:55,980
Whoa.

853
00:42:57,320 --> 00:42:58,440
Whoa, I mean, yeah.

854
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:00,840
And terrain, I was gonna say something

855
00:43:00,840 --> 00:43:03,240
about terrain being an issue for a centaur,

856
00:43:03,240 --> 00:43:05,080
but you've gotta bring your horses,

857
00:43:05,080 --> 00:43:07,640
so it can't be, that's equal.

858
00:43:08,520 --> 00:43:09,960
But there is the issue.

859
00:43:09,960 --> 00:43:11,960
Now, okay, you do have to imagine though

860
00:43:11,960 --> 00:43:14,600
that the caloric load of a centaur-

861
00:43:14,600 --> 00:43:15,560
It's tremendous.

862
00:43:15,560 --> 00:43:16,280
It's tremendous.

863
00:43:16,280 --> 00:43:19,240
I mean, it's not gonna be one-to-one,

864
00:43:19,240 --> 00:43:21,720
but there are certainly some efficiencies there.

865
00:43:21,720 --> 00:43:23,160
Strike it from the pro list.

866
00:43:23,160 --> 00:43:24,440
It's gone, it's gone.

867
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:27,400
Is there something to be said about the styles of combat

868
00:43:27,400 --> 00:43:32,920
that humans beings have that centaurs do not have, right?

869
00:43:34,520 --> 00:43:37,880
Centaurs essentially, it's all cavalry, no infantry.

870
00:43:37,880 --> 00:43:41,720
And so the human beings dismount the horses

871
00:43:41,720 --> 00:43:44,680
and you put those poles to the spikes on the ground

872
00:43:44,680 --> 00:43:45,880
sticking out towards the horses.

873
00:43:45,880 --> 00:43:50,760
You could build like a centaur barricade pretty well,

874
00:43:50,760 --> 00:43:51,720
I feel like.

875
00:43:52,600 --> 00:43:54,280
Another thing is that centaurs,

876
00:43:54,280 --> 00:43:56,680
very little stealth capabilities, I feel like.

877
00:43:56,680 --> 00:43:59,320
Very little guerrilla combat available to them.

878
00:43:59,320 --> 00:44:02,280
You go into a woods and they're playing on an ambush

879
00:44:02,280 --> 00:44:05,080
and all you hear is like, clop, clop, clop, clop, clop.

880
00:44:05,080 --> 00:44:06,520
You're like, there's fucking centaurs here.

881
00:44:06,520 --> 00:44:07,880
Everybody stay frosty.

882
00:44:07,880 --> 00:44:10,120
Let's just open up the big book

883
00:44:10,120 --> 00:44:11,640
that nobody is willing to look at,

884
00:44:11,640 --> 00:44:14,520
but I'm gonna pull it off the shelf, blow the dust off.

885
00:44:14,520 --> 00:44:16,840
And it's a big book labeled espionage.

886
00:44:16,840 --> 00:44:21,560
And that's gonna be extremely difficult for a human,

887
00:44:21,560 --> 00:44:22,840
but feasible.

888
00:44:22,840 --> 00:44:26,440
If you got the right costume, you could maybe pull it off.

889
00:44:26,440 --> 00:44:29,880
If you're a centaur double agent, no one is fooled.

890
00:44:29,880 --> 00:44:30,440
There's just no-

891
00:44:30,440 --> 00:44:33,960
Fuck that, no, you just drape some fucking jeans

892
00:44:34,680 --> 00:44:36,920
around your torso and it'll be like,

893
00:44:36,920 --> 00:44:38,280
that's a weird way to ride a horse.

894
00:44:38,280 --> 00:44:40,360
Don't you judge me, me and this animal.

895
00:44:40,920 --> 00:44:41,880
Where's your horse's head?

896
00:44:41,880 --> 00:44:42,520
Don't worry about it.

897
00:44:42,520 --> 00:44:43,720
It's in the jeans with me.

898
00:44:43,720 --> 00:44:46,360
And Justin, I'm sorry, but I'll tell you who's fooled.

899
00:44:46,360 --> 00:44:47,320
A horse.

900
00:44:47,320 --> 00:44:48,120
Yep.

901
00:44:48,120 --> 00:44:50,440
The human might not be, but the horse is like,

902
00:44:50,440 --> 00:44:52,440
hey, I'm gonna come hang out with you guys here.

903
00:44:52,440 --> 00:44:53,480
You're all horses.

904
00:44:53,480 --> 00:44:54,120
What's that?

905
00:44:54,120 --> 00:44:56,200
Tranquilizer, tranquilizer, tranquilizer.

906
00:44:56,200 --> 00:44:57,240
Let's go, right?

907
00:44:57,240 --> 00:44:58,280
And you're in there.

908
00:44:58,280 --> 00:44:59,320
Also, here's the thing.

909
00:45:00,040 --> 00:45:01,560
We can't separate.

910
00:45:01,560 --> 00:45:03,720
I don't think it's fair in this discussion

911
00:45:03,720 --> 00:45:07,400
to talk about humans separate from horse versus centaur.

912
00:45:08,120 --> 00:45:10,360
Because like, that's not the question.

913
00:45:10,360 --> 00:45:11,160
It's person on horse.

914
00:45:11,160 --> 00:45:13,080
That has to be it, that's our own thing.

915
00:45:13,080 --> 00:45:15,400
That's the only fucking thing we got going for us

916
00:45:15,400 --> 00:45:15,800
in this fight.

917
00:45:15,800 --> 00:45:17,160
You want to tie a hand behind our back?

918
00:45:17,160 --> 00:45:18,040
No way.

919
00:45:18,040 --> 00:45:19,480
It's a plus and a minus.

920
00:45:19,480 --> 00:45:21,400
Well, but then the centaurs are going to partner

921
00:45:21,400 --> 00:45:22,680
with some fairies and shit.

922
00:45:22,680 --> 00:45:24,040
And like, they're in there.

923
00:45:24,040 --> 00:45:24,520
No, come on.

924
00:45:24,520 --> 00:45:27,480
You're confusing this fucking conversation for no reason.

925
00:45:27,480 --> 00:45:29,720
My ability to get off a horse is the only thing

926
00:45:29,720 --> 00:45:31,640
separating me from centaurs.

927
00:45:32,920 --> 00:45:34,840
This is their ability to factor in.

928
00:45:34,840 --> 00:45:37,080
And their connection, their deep connection

929
00:45:37,080 --> 00:45:38,440
is the advantage over us.

930
00:45:38,440 --> 00:45:39,960
It's the one defining factor.

931
00:45:39,960 --> 00:45:43,640
Now, I will grant, Travis, that I think that

932
00:45:44,280 --> 00:45:48,120
allowing for humans to sort of build traps

933
00:45:48,120 --> 00:45:51,320
and what have you is against the spirit.

934
00:45:52,200 --> 00:45:54,120
I think it's against the spirit of the question.

935
00:45:54,120 --> 00:45:55,800
I think the assumption has to be anytime

936
00:45:55,800 --> 00:45:58,360
these two are fighting, it is definitely man on horse.

937
00:45:58,360 --> 00:46:00,440
Whose fucking side are you on in this thing?

938
00:46:00,440 --> 00:46:03,640
Because it sounds like you're anti-human now.

939
00:46:03,640 --> 00:46:06,280
I'm just torn about it, Griffin, because the thing is,

940
00:46:06,280 --> 00:46:08,440
if they do separate and can separate,

941
00:46:08,440 --> 00:46:10,760
it also lends the centaurs an advantage

942
00:46:10,760 --> 00:46:12,680
because if they get the drop on the humans,

943
00:46:13,640 --> 00:46:14,760
it could be a massacre.

944
00:46:14,760 --> 00:46:16,120
I mean, it could be-

945
00:46:16,120 --> 00:46:17,720
I could fuck up a centaur right now.

946
00:46:17,720 --> 00:46:18,520
I'm not afraid.

947
00:46:18,520 --> 00:46:19,320
This is fucked up.

948
00:46:19,320 --> 00:46:20,120
Can we agree?

949
00:46:21,800 --> 00:46:24,520
I think what we have to all accept now

950
00:46:25,240 --> 00:46:29,640
is the ultimate is a person centaur team up.

951
00:46:29,640 --> 00:46:30,680
Whoa, hold on.

952
00:46:31,400 --> 00:46:31,880
Right?

953
00:46:31,880 --> 00:46:34,760
Whoa, I did not expect this West Side story bullshit.

954
00:46:34,760 --> 00:46:37,640
This is a love story that blossoms here.

955
00:46:37,640 --> 00:46:39,240
But imagine that.

956
00:46:39,240 --> 00:46:41,320
Think about riding a horse and being able to

957
00:46:41,880 --> 00:46:44,840
also strategize with them and be like,

958
00:46:44,840 --> 00:46:46,040
you go left, I'll go right.

959
00:46:46,040 --> 00:46:47,720
You pick me back up and then we're gonna-

960
00:46:49,400 --> 00:46:52,440
I have a short, I have a very short list of people

961
00:46:52,440 --> 00:46:55,400
in my life where if I was a centaur,

962
00:46:56,760 --> 00:46:58,680
I would be okay with them riding me.

963
00:46:58,680 --> 00:46:59,720
It's very short.

964
00:46:59,720 --> 00:47:02,280
And boys, I don't know if you're on it.

965
00:47:02,280 --> 00:47:03,400
It's really short.

966
00:47:03,400 --> 00:47:05,320
Give me a bit more time on the slow carb diet.

967
00:47:05,320 --> 00:47:05,800
We'll see.

968
00:47:05,800 --> 00:47:07,720
It may be a little more validable.

969
00:47:07,720 --> 00:47:08,360
It's not a weight thing.

970
00:47:08,360 --> 00:47:08,920
It's not a weight thing.

971
00:47:08,920 --> 00:47:10,600
Because first of all, if I was a centaur,

972
00:47:10,600 --> 00:47:12,600
I would have the most beautiful, strong, proud back

973
00:47:12,600 --> 00:47:13,720
and I can carry anybody.

974
00:47:15,800 --> 00:47:18,440
Why do you not think that your centaur form

975
00:47:18,440 --> 00:47:20,520
would be a reflection of your current

976
00:47:21,640 --> 00:47:24,520
uber fragile, no hot food allowed human state?

977
00:47:24,520 --> 00:47:28,040
I don't see why you're granting yourself immunity

978
00:47:28,040 --> 00:47:30,040
to stomach acid all of a sudden.

979
00:47:30,040 --> 00:47:31,400
Big, beautiful, proud, strong back.

980
00:47:31,400 --> 00:47:33,080
I can carry anybody.

981
00:47:33,080 --> 00:47:35,800
It is not a, it has nothing to do with you.

982
00:47:35,800 --> 00:47:40,040
It has everything to do with my pride, I guess.

983
00:47:40,040 --> 00:47:42,440
You never just see like, wait, who would you?

984
00:47:42,440 --> 00:47:43,720
Well, who's at the top of your list?

985
00:47:43,720 --> 00:47:44,680
Who's number one?

986
00:47:44,680 --> 00:47:45,720
Yes, yes, yes.

987
00:47:45,720 --> 00:47:46,760
I mean, it was in our vows

988
00:47:46,760 --> 00:47:47,640
and you guys were at the wedding.

989
00:47:47,640 --> 00:47:48,440
So, you know, Rachel.

990
00:47:51,480 --> 00:47:54,200
I mean, my son, but after, I mean, it's dangerous up there.

991
00:47:54,200 --> 00:47:57,080
Big, strong back and he can't really sit up so good yet.

992
00:47:57,800 --> 00:47:59,720
I'm gonna say Joe Biden's at the top of mine.

993
00:47:59,720 --> 00:48:01,000
Joe Biden's up there for me too.

994
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:02,040
I mean, that goes without saying,

995
00:48:02,040 --> 00:48:03,480
just because I think he probably does have

996
00:48:03,480 --> 00:48:05,080
some sort of equestrian experience.

997
00:48:05,080 --> 00:48:06,600
And he'll call himself Joe Ryden,

998
00:48:06,600 --> 00:48:10,040
which is like, oh, Joe, yes, so good.

999
00:48:10,040 --> 00:48:12,760
Now, are we assuming that the first time they meet,

1000
00:48:12,760 --> 00:48:15,880
there is no period in which the centaurs

1001
00:48:15,880 --> 00:48:18,280
are sort of swept up, or sorry,

1002
00:48:18,280 --> 00:48:20,040
the humans are sort of swept up

1003
00:48:20,040 --> 00:48:23,080
in the majesty and beauty of seeing centaurs for real.

1004
00:48:23,080 --> 00:48:24,120
We're gonna lose a lot of humans

1005
00:48:24,120 --> 00:48:25,800
just from that sort of shock factor.

1006
00:48:25,800 --> 00:48:27,400
Oh, see, I think the opposite.

1007
00:48:27,400 --> 00:48:30,600
I think humans, what we know about humans in,

1008
00:48:30,600 --> 00:48:34,360
you know, now is like the immediate distrust of like,

1009
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:37,960
no, we're just gonna go ahead and just start the war.

1010
00:48:37,960 --> 00:48:39,080
I think humans start the war.

1011
00:48:39,080 --> 00:48:41,560
I think centaurs start the war, yeah.

1012
00:48:41,560 --> 00:48:45,400
The humans will be more upset

1013
00:48:45,400 --> 00:48:49,320
by the sort of like fear of the outsider here

1014
00:48:49,320 --> 00:48:52,200
than centaurs are gonna be about the blasphemy

1015
00:48:52,760 --> 00:48:54,280
of humans riding horses.

1016
00:48:54,280 --> 00:48:55,800
That will disgust them.

1017
00:48:55,800 --> 00:48:57,640
Here's a fact that we've never considered

1018
00:48:57,640 --> 00:48:59,000
in this argument yet.

1019
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:02,600
One makes us think this war gets going.

1020
00:49:02,600 --> 00:49:03,960
This war is popping off.

1021
00:49:04,680 --> 00:49:06,120
One makes us think that the horses

1022
00:49:06,120 --> 00:49:08,120
are gonna stay on our fucking side.

1023
00:49:08,120 --> 00:49:08,920
Oh, fuck.

1024
00:49:10,200 --> 00:49:10,680
You're right.

1025
00:49:11,320 --> 00:49:14,200
I think that's the deciding factor here.

1026
00:49:14,200 --> 00:49:16,200
I think maybe they'll stick with us for a while, right?

1027
00:49:16,200 --> 00:49:17,160
Just cause it's what they know.

1028
00:49:17,160 --> 00:49:19,080
We give them sugar cubes.

1029
00:49:19,720 --> 00:49:23,080
But after a minute, they see this other way of living

1030
00:49:23,080 --> 00:49:25,080
and they're like, hey, you know what?

1031
00:49:25,080 --> 00:49:28,760
You keep me in a big jail and feed me sugar cubes only.

1032
00:49:28,760 --> 00:49:29,080
Bye.

1033
00:49:30,680 --> 00:49:32,360
If that happens, we're fucked.

1034
00:49:32,360 --> 00:49:33,720
If that happens, we're done.

1035
00:49:33,720 --> 00:49:34,440
We're done.

1036
00:49:34,440 --> 00:49:36,760
And the only way to get a grasp on the situation

1037
00:49:36,760 --> 00:49:38,200
is to tighten the grip.

1038
00:49:38,200 --> 00:49:39,800
And I'm fucking uncomfortable with that.

1039
00:49:39,800 --> 00:49:41,640
I don't wanna win like that.

1040
00:49:41,640 --> 00:49:44,680
No, Griffin, I think we need to build more trust

1041
00:49:45,720 --> 00:49:48,600
with our horses now.

1042
00:49:48,600 --> 00:49:49,560
Start now.

1043
00:49:49,560 --> 00:49:52,520
We've gotta promise them liberty.

1044
00:49:52,520 --> 00:49:54,200
We've gotta promise them freedom

1045
00:49:54,840 --> 00:49:56,520
if they help us win this war.

1046
00:49:56,520 --> 00:50:00,840
Is this like the beginning of a Planet of the Apes movie

1047
00:50:00,840 --> 00:50:02,600
where like us working with horses

1048
00:50:02,600 --> 00:50:04,680
is what leads to centaurs

1049
00:50:04,680 --> 00:50:06,840
and then we have to fight our own,

1050
00:50:06,840 --> 00:50:08,760
like that's the future that centaurs have.

1051
00:50:08,760 --> 00:50:10,600
Okay, Travis, are you suggesting,

1052
00:50:10,600 --> 00:50:12,840
and I think you are and I'm just gonna pretend you are

1053
00:50:12,840 --> 00:50:13,880
if you aren't,

1054
00:50:13,880 --> 00:50:18,200
are you suggesting that this war takes quite a while

1055
00:50:18,200 --> 00:50:22,920
and in an underground bunker hidden from the eyes of centaur

1056
00:50:22,920 --> 00:50:25,960
and more faithful humans alike,

1057
00:50:25,960 --> 00:50:28,280
scientists decide that we have to,

1058
00:50:28,280 --> 00:50:32,120
the only recourse is to breed our own race of centaurs

1059
00:50:32,120 --> 00:50:34,920
in the exact way that you think that that would happen?

1060
00:50:34,920 --> 00:50:36,920
Yes, and then we send them back

1061
00:50:36,920 --> 00:50:40,360
to start to like fight the war for us at the beginning.

1062
00:50:40,360 --> 00:50:42,280
This is like a Terminator situation.

1063
00:50:42,280 --> 00:50:45,960
Boys, I am thinking about those early centaurs.

1064
00:50:47,640 --> 00:50:50,040
There's gonna be some whoopsies in there, huh?

1065
00:50:51,320 --> 00:50:51,800
Wait a minute.

1066
00:50:51,800 --> 00:50:54,920
It's just a fucking horse body, four hooves,

1067
00:50:54,920 --> 00:50:57,000
and then just like at the armpits,

1068
00:50:57,000 --> 00:50:59,480
it starts right at the end of the top hooves

1069
00:50:59,480 --> 00:51:02,440
and the dude's arms and head just hanging down like,

1070
00:51:02,440 --> 00:51:04,760
oh yes, oats me, dog.

1071
00:51:06,200 --> 00:51:10,120
Can you imagine a centaur with horse body,

1072
00:51:10,120 --> 00:51:11,720
horse neck, human head?

1073
00:51:11,720 --> 00:51:14,840
No torso, just human head on horse neck.

1074
00:51:14,840 --> 00:51:17,160
Imagine horse body, no neck or head,

1075
00:51:17,160 --> 00:51:19,800
but then the human torso and arms and human head

1076
00:51:19,800 --> 00:51:22,520
are coming out of the side of the horse body.

1077
00:51:22,520 --> 00:51:25,880
Oh no.

1078
00:51:25,880 --> 00:51:28,840
He's just always stunting off the side.

1079
00:51:29,880 --> 00:51:30,680
This is true.

1080
00:51:30,680 --> 00:51:33,640
Centaurs are always seen with like upright spine

1081
00:51:33,640 --> 00:51:34,840
from where the neck would be.

1082
00:51:34,840 --> 00:51:36,920
What if it's just straight out continuation,

1083
00:51:37,560 --> 00:51:39,720
just flat looking downward?

1084
00:51:39,720 --> 00:51:42,360
I, Travis, I'm gonna go with your plan.

1085
00:51:42,360 --> 00:51:46,520
We send the centaurs back in time to begin the war,

1086
00:51:46,520 --> 00:51:48,760
but we send them back too far.

1087
00:51:48,760 --> 00:51:49,560
And what do they do?

1088
00:51:49,560 --> 00:51:51,160
They continue to breed.

1089
00:51:51,160 --> 00:51:52,600
And then what do we find out?

1090
00:51:52,600 --> 00:51:53,480
That's right.

1091
00:51:53,480 --> 00:51:56,360
The centaurs that we're fighting in present day

1092
00:51:56,360 --> 00:51:58,360
are the descendants of the centaurs

1093
00:51:58,360 --> 00:52:00,520
that we ourselves invented and sent back in time.

1094
00:52:00,520 --> 00:52:02,040
When will we learn?

1095
00:52:02,040 --> 00:52:03,480
It was our own hubris.

1096
00:52:05,560 --> 00:52:07,080
Someone needs to stop us.

1097
00:52:08,440 --> 00:52:13,720
We need to stop making mix ups in God's Chipotle

1098
00:52:13,720 --> 00:52:16,520
and just kind of accept what we have on Earth.

1099
00:52:16,520 --> 00:52:18,360
Stop throwing the beans and rice around

1100
00:52:18,360 --> 00:52:20,840
in the good Lord's Chipotle.

1101
00:52:20,840 --> 00:52:23,000
And just kind of be satisfied with what we get.

1102
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:24,920
Appreciate every day.

1103
00:52:24,920 --> 00:52:25,720
Every day is a gift.

1104
00:52:25,720 --> 00:52:26,840
That's why it's called the present.

1105
00:52:28,280 --> 00:52:30,040
Maybe the centaurs deserve to win.

1106
00:52:30,600 --> 00:52:32,040
I think the centaurs deserve to win.

1107
00:52:32,040 --> 00:52:33,720
I think it's time to give someone else a shot.

1108
00:52:33,720 --> 00:52:35,000
Give someone else a chance.

1109
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:36,040
Good house we screwed.

1110
00:52:36,040 --> 00:52:37,640
We've already screwed this pooch.

1111
00:52:37,640 --> 00:52:39,320
I think it's time to give somebody else a chance

1112
00:52:39,320 --> 00:52:39,960
running things.

1113
00:52:40,680 --> 00:52:41,800
I'm talking about these centaurs.

1114
00:52:43,160 --> 00:52:45,560
I cannot stop thinking about a side saddle centaur.

1115
00:52:45,560 --> 00:52:51,480
That is the most grisly life I could ever, ever envision.

1116
00:52:51,480 --> 00:52:52,680
Horsehead human body.

1117
00:52:53,640 --> 00:52:55,560
I mean, good.

1118
00:52:56,120 --> 00:52:57,000
That's good.

1119
00:52:57,000 --> 00:52:57,560
It's good.

1120
00:52:58,280 --> 00:52:59,480
Yeah, you never really think about that.

1121
00:53:00,200 --> 00:53:03,480
The perfect blend probably took quite a few generations

1122
00:53:03,480 --> 00:53:04,440
of experimentation.

1123
00:53:06,440 --> 00:53:10,200
Well, folks, that's going to do it for us.

1124
00:53:10,200 --> 00:53:10,520
Oh, shit.

1125
00:53:10,520 --> 00:53:12,360
That was like 25 minutes of horse talk.

1126
00:53:12,360 --> 00:53:14,440
That's our whole episode.

1127
00:53:14,440 --> 00:53:15,800
We hope you enjoyed this discussion

1128
00:53:15,800 --> 00:53:17,240
because it was half the show.

1129
00:53:17,240 --> 00:53:19,240
And the ones before it also were there.

1130
00:53:20,040 --> 00:53:24,440
Hey, listen, I'm going to be doing Sawbones live

1131
00:53:24,440 --> 00:53:25,480
in Philadelphia.

1132
00:53:26,120 --> 00:53:27,400
And I would really like it.

1133
00:53:27,400 --> 00:53:29,560
It's going to be next or this coming weekend,

1134
00:53:29,560 --> 00:53:30,600
I guess, by the time you listen to this,

1135
00:53:30,600 --> 00:53:32,040
if you would come out and check that.

1136
00:53:32,040 --> 00:53:33,240
What day is that?

1137
00:53:33,240 --> 00:53:35,400
That is going to be Sunday.

1138
00:53:36,760 --> 00:53:38,920
And you can get tickets.

1139
00:53:38,920 --> 00:53:40,120
The 16th or the 9th?

1140
00:53:40,120 --> 00:53:41,800
Because this is coming out on the 10th.

1141
00:53:41,800 --> 00:53:42,840
Yeah, it's the 16th.

1142
00:53:42,840 --> 00:53:43,640
Sunday the 16th.

1143
00:53:43,640 --> 00:53:44,360
Okay, okay.

1144
00:53:44,360 --> 00:53:46,760
It's going to be at 2 p.m. at the Trocadero Theater.

1145
00:53:46,760 --> 00:53:49,480
Tickets are like $24.50, I think.

1146
00:53:50,120 --> 00:53:51,720
Sunday, July 16th.

1147
00:53:51,720 --> 00:53:53,560
That's part of the Philly Podcast Festival.

1148
00:53:53,560 --> 00:53:55,160
Sawbones is going to be live.

1149
00:53:55,160 --> 00:53:58,680
And you can get tickets at bit.ly forward slash Sawbones Philly.

1150
00:53:59,480 --> 00:54:00,360
Come out and say hi.

1151
00:54:00,360 --> 00:54:01,080
It should be fun.

1152
00:54:01,080 --> 00:54:01,960
It's in the middle of the afternoon.

1153
00:54:01,960 --> 00:54:02,920
It's an all ages show.

1154
00:54:03,800 --> 00:54:06,360
No swearing to the best of our ability.

1155
00:54:06,920 --> 00:54:09,720
And Flophouse is going to be there too.

1156
00:54:09,720 --> 00:54:11,720
So get tickets to see them.

1157
00:54:11,720 --> 00:54:14,120
And come out and see me.

1158
00:54:15,960 --> 00:54:20,920
We are also, of course, doing our live shows at San Diego Comic Con

1159
00:54:20,920 --> 00:54:22,360
coming up in just a couple weeks.

1160
00:54:22,360 --> 00:54:24,840
So if you have questions for the My Brother, My Brother, and Me show,

1161
00:54:24,840 --> 00:54:29,240
make sure to send them in with the subject SDCC live show.

1162
00:54:29,960 --> 00:54:32,760
And maybe we'll see you there as we're walking around and stuff.

1163
00:54:33,480 --> 00:54:35,160
I want to thank John Roderick and the Long Winters

1164
00:54:35,160 --> 00:54:37,000
for these for our theme song, It's a Departure,

1165
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:39,240
which is a song off the album, Putting the Days to Bed.

1166
00:54:39,240 --> 00:54:40,600
It's a very, very good song.

1167
00:54:40,600 --> 00:54:41,160
Very good album.

1168
00:54:41,160 --> 00:54:43,800
We're very grateful that we're able to use it here on this show.

1169
00:54:43,800 --> 00:54:45,960
I also want to thank Maximum Fun for having us on the network.

Right and hi, Zoe Kinski.

1180

It's from Yahoo Answers user Christian who asks,

1181
00:55:15,560 --> 00:55:17,960
Is Minecraft based on a true story?

1182
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:22,520
My name is Justin McElroy.
