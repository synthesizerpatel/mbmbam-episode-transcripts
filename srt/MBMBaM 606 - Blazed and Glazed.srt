1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,820
The McElroy brothers are not experts and their advice should never be followed

2
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:10,580
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it

3
00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:17,660
Also, this show isn't for kids which I mentioned only so the babies out there will know how cool they are for listening

4
00:00:17,660 --> 00:00:30,660
What's up, you cool, baby?

5
00:00:47,900 --> 00:00:49,900
It's better, it's better with you

6
00:00:53,940 --> 00:00:55,940
It's better, it's better with you

7
00:01:00,220 --> 00:01:02,220
It's better, it's better with you

8
00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:13,820
Hello everybody and welcome to my brother my brother me an advice show for the modern era

9
00:01:13,820 --> 00:01:21,020
I'm your oldest brother Justin McElroy. I'm Travis the resplendent. I am Griffin McElroy. Hey guys

10
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:29,220
Can it come any faster can I go to sleep now

11
00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:32,620
Hibernate through the time when this doesn't happen

12
00:01:33,100 --> 00:01:37,900
24th bonk me on the head with a bowling ball in a very

13
00:01:37,900 --> 00:01:43,620
Specific way with a very specific amount of force to make me be asleep until June 24th

14
00:01:43,620 --> 00:01:50,820
Let me go to sleep bowling in the clouds only to wake up on June 24th with a long beard. Oh, I creak awake

15
00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:57,460
Oh, what's that? My kids are like two and a half months older. That's not that bad. But what's that man versus B is out?

16
00:01:57,460 --> 00:02:00,460
Huh? It's all worth it. It was all worthwhile

17
00:02:00,460 --> 00:02:08,700
because our head hurts all the time and we can't smell no more but a man versus B is out and we get to

18
00:02:08,700 --> 00:02:12,100
Watch it whenever the fuck we want. Now. Here's I know what you're wondering

19
00:02:12,460 --> 00:02:17,980
What are you allowed to watch it? The answer is as you want. Well, here's the thing you here's the thing

20
00:02:17,980 --> 00:02:21,940
What is man versus B? Well, first of all, it's a revelation. Second of all is

21
00:02:21,940 --> 00:02:29,940
A revelation. It's a revelation. It's it's revelations. It's the first sign of revelations. It's Rowan Atkinson. Yeah, he's back

22
00:02:29,940 --> 00:02:35,260
And he's fighting a B in a Netflix get this series impossible

23
00:02:35,260 --> 00:02:38,460
This is the impossible part of man versus B. Thank you. Yes, I agree

24
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:46,700
Man versus B can't be a series can't be a series unless there is a development where it becomes a

25
00:02:47,060 --> 00:02:48,340
like

26
00:02:48,340 --> 00:02:52,700
Emotional journey of these two battling. Okay, it'll be an emotional journey

27
00:02:52,700 --> 00:02:58,580
You know the tagline prepare for battle Rowan Atkinson man versus B landing 24th of June

28
00:02:58,580 --> 00:03:01,380
That's literally all we know. He is holding a spatula and there's

29
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:08,840
Fire yeah, so I think chaos is part of this. Okay. Yeah, so here's what I need you guys to help me do

30
00:03:08,860 --> 00:03:16,320
Uh-huh, man versus B. The poster looks like mouse hunt, right? Yes. Oh, yeah thousand in a major way, but it's not

31
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:22,480
It's not man versus B the movie. Nope. It's man versus B the series. So I need you guys to help me brainstorm

32
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:30,160
How this is a series. Every episode the B gives a food challenge that he has to complete. Okay, I like that. I like that

33
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:32,640
That's it. It is scripted though

34
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:39,040
I love that they say in the tweet that it's scripted as if I they would have the fucking

35
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:47,040
Guts, guts to do an unscripted reality series about Rowan Atkinson fighting a B. So thank you for the clarification

36
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:53,020
What if in fighting the B he starts becoming a B himself?

37
00:03:53,020 --> 00:03:55,880
Ooh, a Kafka-esque. Yes, and it's like

38
00:03:56,840 --> 00:04:03,160
Three seasons in he's like I am the stinger. Yeah, it's like he's the he becomes the B. The B man

39
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:10,940
Sarah Davis who works with us and is incredible asked who is voicing the B based off of she does not know if the B

40
00:04:10,940 --> 00:04:16,680
Speaks but her assumption and I believe it's correct is that the B must speak and my assumption in response is I

41
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:23,660
Bet the B if it is voiced is voiced also by Rowan Atkinson at which way what I love about this

42
00:04:23,660 --> 00:04:29,080
Is it poses a like the B is not just like oh, no, there's a B in my kitchen. I gotta deal with it

43
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:31,080
It is an active antagonist

44
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:35,720
To Rowan Atkinson and everybody else is like man. It's just a B. Leave it alone

45
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:40,480
Then I can see where it's slowly him devolving into wait

46
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:46,760
Am I the man or the B who have I become what is this moment? We can't love this. We can't

47
00:04:47,260 --> 00:04:53,960
We don't work for Netflix. You're right. We don't we are not Rowan Atkinson. We cannot possibly

48
00:04:53,960 --> 00:05:01,360
Possibly deign to guess at what the plot structure of man versus B is gonna be but if you ask me who's gonna voice

49
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:04,820
It be I will I would say Gerald Seinfeld because he speaks for the beats

50
00:05:04,980 --> 00:05:09,440
now this is an excellent point Griffin because my assumption here is that somewhere a

51
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:17,100
TV a creator person was watching B movie and getting more and more frustrated and finally they just screamed to the heaven

52
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:20,060
But what about the man side of the story, right?

53
00:05:20,060 --> 00:05:25,380
Guys, okay. So here's some more I went to the I headed on over to IMDb to try to get some more details

54
00:05:25,380 --> 00:05:28,080
Getting them those clicks. We have some behind-the-scenes

55
00:05:30,660 --> 00:05:33,000
Shots of Rowan Atkinson and the

56
00:05:35,020 --> 00:05:39,020
Outfit that this man is wearing the look the steez of this man

57
00:05:39,740 --> 00:05:42,220
In the in this in the I'm gonna send home

58
00:05:42,220 --> 00:05:46,260
I'm gonna send you guys a screenshot if you're at home or you're driving go to IMDb

59
00:05:46,260 --> 00:05:53,020
No, don't do it for driving if you're driving Travis. It's that important. Okay, it's that important pull over to the side of the road

60
00:05:53,020 --> 00:05:57,300
Wherever you are just pull over. I'm gonna stop and put on your hazards

61
00:05:57,500 --> 00:06:03,500
Just stop put on your hazards cuz this takes this takes precedence, right? This is more important. Hold on. I

62
00:06:04,340 --> 00:06:07,140
Can't wait. Yeah, it's gonna be so fucking good

63
00:06:07,820 --> 00:06:10,060
huh, so I've sent you a screenshot of the

64
00:06:10,060 --> 00:06:15,540
Of behind the scenes and his fucking steez is his shirt and his hat makes it look like he's

65
00:06:16,300 --> 00:06:21,060
Making legally mandated door-to-door introductions. Okay. Yeah, this is the first thing

66
00:06:21,060 --> 00:06:22,760
The second thing that I could tell you about it

67
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:27,780
Is that his house sitting in a luxurious mansion who will win and what?

68
00:06:27,940 --> 00:06:34,140
Irreparable Dan image will be done in the process and actually I find myself asking that second question quite seriously

69
00:06:35,180 --> 00:06:37,180
Can I tell you what's wild?

70
00:06:37,180 --> 00:06:45,100
Shouldn't they shouldn't no pun intended bug me but in the promotional photo the image that Netflix is posted

71
00:06:45,180 --> 00:06:47,180
He has a very close haircut

72
00:06:47,580 --> 00:06:55,100
Very representative and then I look at this image and I'm like, is there a time-lapse the bee and him end up living together?

73
00:06:55,180 --> 00:07:02,860
And this image comes from let's say 15 years later and they're watching their first child go off to high school

74
00:07:02,860 --> 00:07:09,300
each I okay first sorry guys now Griffin I assumed it would be adopted but I see what you're saying

75
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:13,900
I just got in first cast reveal. I have four cast members

76
00:07:14,620 --> 00:07:20,840
In the cast currently Jing Lucy plays Nina Lee Byford plays builder

77
00:07:21,220 --> 00:07:24,740
Tony McCarthy is playing you guessed it Prisoner

78
00:07:25,300 --> 00:07:29,300
1968 huh? Yeah, that's a sick album from Megadeth

79
00:07:29,300 --> 00:07:35,060
I don't know if you've ever heard it says Rowan Atkinson unknown episodes. Let's hope it's all I would

80
00:07:37,660 --> 00:07:42,140
Shit that's the twist Justin. He's dead for a step. That's that lost the twist

81
00:07:43,220 --> 00:07:45,220
Anything can happen

82
00:07:48,420 --> 00:07:51,660
That's cool and then man man is his last name

83
00:07:51,660 --> 00:07:56,860
He kills the heat be kills man in the first app and then it becomes a legal case

84
00:07:56,860 --> 00:07:59,660
I'm man VB where his family is

85
00:08:00,460 --> 00:08:02,980
Suing the bee. Here's here's what's stressing me out

86
00:08:03,820 --> 00:08:09,420
Yeah, stressing me out. Yeah, talk about irreparable damage. That's gonna be done in the process. I'm standing by the way

87
00:08:09,420 --> 00:08:14,500
Yeah, I'm pacing I'm saying I can tell I hear it irreparable damage done the process to our brand

88
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:17,220
I know as much as we've talked about this now

89
00:08:17,740 --> 00:08:23,380
It is gonna be something that people tell us about yeah every step of the way every and you know

90
00:08:23,380 --> 00:08:30,380
What in this case good? I'll take keep anything. Yeah, keep it coming. Keep it coming. I gotta know more about me

91
00:08:32,460 --> 00:08:38,460
Do you think the episodes are like three minutes long and then that's how they make a series out of it

92
00:08:40,100 --> 00:08:41,260
Here's the thing guys

93
00:08:41,260 --> 00:08:48,660
I know you're not supposed to do it like the handle like liberals telling you not to but you can kill a be so easy

94
00:08:48,660 --> 00:08:54,220
You're so much bigger than they are and as soon as you stop being afraid of the sharp part on them

95
00:08:54,260 --> 00:08:56,580
Yeah, you learn that the rest of the parts of them are

96
00:08:57,660 --> 00:09:02,500
Will yield beneath your your mighty pond. Also all things considered bees. Oh

97
00:09:03,460 --> 00:09:08,180
Fine, you know what? I mean at a certain point and I haven't seen the movie but at a certain point

98
00:09:08,180 --> 00:09:12,940
I don't know how long I can go before I'm just like just ignore it. Yeah, what's the beef?

99
00:09:12,940 --> 00:09:17,260
What could what damage could it be possibly to launch it?

100
00:09:17,260 --> 00:09:22,100
Sorry, there's somebody there's somebody at my door. That was the weirdest. Oh my god. It's me from the future

101
00:09:22,900 --> 00:09:24,740
What Justin?

102
00:09:24,740 --> 00:09:27,920
It's ten episodes long. Wow

103
00:09:28,660 --> 00:09:31,500
Wait, that can't be right. I swear to God

104
00:09:32,220 --> 00:09:33,940
now

105
00:09:33,940 --> 00:09:35,940
Season one

106
00:09:36,420 --> 00:09:41,580
Season one of this epic tale season one, huh? This is be how is it ten episodes?

107
00:09:41,580 --> 00:09:47,820
I hope that the first nine episodes are building to the B and the man encountering each other for the first time

108
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:55,740
I hope that they have the sheer guts to make the man and be not face off until like episode 10

109
00:09:55,740 --> 00:09:58,780
Do it right your style where it's taking place in like two

110
00:09:59,740 --> 00:10:02,420
Lines and they meet in the middle. That's good

111
00:10:03,660 --> 00:10:09,300
I love this get to see I imagine Rowan Atkinson's backstory and that be

112
00:10:09,300 --> 00:10:13,100
Talking about like his greatest opponent, right?

113
00:10:15,420 --> 00:10:17,420
How is it ten episodes Justin

114
00:10:18,460 --> 00:10:20,460
How many episodes should it be Justin?

115
00:10:20,980 --> 00:10:23,740
Mr. Mr. Hotshot fucking Hollywood producer

116
00:10:25,660 --> 00:10:30,580
Okay, how many episodes or episodes well now it's a miniseries Justin

117
00:10:30,580 --> 00:10:39,740
Yeah, which means we it's got Golden Globe heat at that point. That's true earth. What if it oh, oh, what if it doesn't come to America?

118
00:10:39,740 --> 00:10:47,200
No, fuck that. I'll move. I'll move to the UK for ten weeks cuz I assume they're not gonna dump this all at once

119
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:49,200
This will be one episode at a time

120
00:10:49,380 --> 00:10:56,100
Yeah, this is appointment view. This is the point. You can't dump it all at once. This is structure. They're gonna build this out

121
00:10:56,100 --> 00:11:01,060
They're gonna be there day one. We'll be there day one live streaming with you

122
00:11:01,420 --> 00:11:07,260
Yeah, we're doing a live watch along June 24th. Get there if we can make it to the premiere fuck man

123
00:11:07,260 --> 00:11:12,460
I'll be there. You know what I mean? I can't make they gotta send me screenies. I got oh, yeah

124
00:11:14,620 --> 00:11:20,780
Process it's got big sag energy this one. You can't expect me to just talk about a day one unpack my feelings

125
00:11:20,780 --> 00:11:27,700
No, I need time. Did we say Rowan Atkinson's bad yet? I feel like we could have covered that up. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah

126
00:11:27,700 --> 00:11:33,700
Okay, good. Yeah. So anyway, um, if we hey, here's a safe assumption if we do a watch or something

127
00:11:33,700 --> 00:11:36,900
There's probably at least one person in there. We don't like yeah, right?

128
00:11:37,140 --> 00:11:42,380
This one there's just the one person so far the B might be a piece of shit. Yeah, that's true

129
00:11:42,380 --> 00:11:47,660
I don't know about this B. I don't know what this B is doing. I don't know. Oh boy

130
00:11:47,660 --> 00:11:51,980
Oh boy, but if they caught me right now and said hey, would you voice the beat? I consider it

131
00:11:51,980 --> 00:11:53,980
I see what the offer is

132
00:11:55,740 --> 00:11:57,900
How's it ten how is it ten though

133
00:11:57,900 --> 00:12:02,180
I'm hoping that maybe this is one of those like early side the hedgehog things

134
00:12:02,420 --> 00:12:07,900
We're like all the fans are like certainly not ten. Yeah, like, okay, we regret

135
00:12:12,060 --> 00:12:17,180
They'll also be like Rowan Atkinson's whole steez looks way off guys and they'll be like, oh, okay

136
00:12:17,180 --> 00:12:19,460
We'll see GI in a different Rowan Atkinson

137
00:12:20,540 --> 00:12:27,100
Can I posit this I could see it being ten episodes. Just take out Rowan and give me Chris O'Dowd. Thank you

138
00:12:27,740 --> 00:12:33,020
Okay, Richard Ayoade fighting a B. Oh my fuck. I would watch a hundred episodes of that

139
00:12:33,020 --> 00:12:33,900
Are you kidding me?

140
00:12:33,900 --> 00:12:39,740
Legitimately pumped if somebody was like do you want to watch Richard Ayoade fight a B for ten episodes like yeah, so

141
00:12:40,060 --> 00:12:45,700
Lutely, yes for some reason as soon as you said Chris my mind went to Elliot and I would also watch that

142
00:12:45,700 --> 00:12:48,740
Also watch there's so many people I would rather watch fight a B

143
00:12:49,300 --> 00:12:54,380
Almost any but yeah, almost any it's the least I mean except unless it was like

144
00:12:55,300 --> 00:12:58,180
Lawrence the Cable Gentleman like that that would be the only

145
00:12:58,820 --> 00:13:05,580
But if it if he was playing himself and he had kind of like let his hair down and retarger this is him at home

146
00:13:06,460 --> 00:13:09,020
Cameras are off the lights have dimmed, you know

147
00:13:09,020 --> 00:13:16,260
The Lawrence the Cable Gentleman doesn't have quite as funky an accent as he puts I know he's laying a little bit. It is a role

148
00:13:16,260 --> 00:13:21,160
He's got he's got a little bit of drawl, but it is not nearly the the no

149
00:13:21,380 --> 00:13:24,900
Get the cadence that he pulls off in his in his day-to-day life

150
00:13:24,900 --> 00:13:30,020
He is Lawrence Chrysler the National Security Advisor to the Biden administration

151
00:13:30,020 --> 00:13:35,860
So that is day-to-day and then at night he's like get her done. Yeah. Hey time to get her done

152
00:13:35,860 --> 00:13:40,540
That must have been really hard. Can you imagine him in the mirror for like three days straight? Just like get her done

153
00:13:40,540 --> 00:13:42,540
Get her done. Yeah

154
00:13:46,780 --> 00:13:52,740
So we got to focus on man versus be right here I showed is the same day told from a different perspective

155
00:13:53,020 --> 00:13:55,020
It's the same offense

156
00:13:57,100 --> 00:14:00,540
Yes, this is what I'm saying I can see that how much them on okay

157
00:14:00,540 --> 00:14:06,780
I would also accept ten episodes each episode exact same exact same different comedian

158
00:14:06,940 --> 00:14:11,740
Plays the Rowan Atkinson part each time. I would watch that. That would be good

159
00:14:11,740 --> 00:14:18,580
I want one of the episodes to just be a shot-for-shot recreation of that one episode of Breaking Bad where there's the fly

160
00:14:18,580 --> 00:14:23,660
But in this case, it's a B and the BS represent the guilt you feel for letting someone die

161
00:14:24,420 --> 00:14:25,820
exactly

162
00:14:25,820 --> 00:14:32,960
He was he in a situation where he's like I want to do a TV show who my friends to see who wants to do

163
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:37,620
A TV show. Not bad. Not far. I were like, we checked and no no

164
00:14:38,340 --> 00:14:40,340
He's like what about bees?

165
00:14:40,580 --> 00:14:45,900
What about bees indeed Rowan? He walked into like his manager's office or his agents and he said, okay

166
00:14:45,900 --> 00:14:52,060
You know what? I'm ready. Hand me the stack of scripts people have submitted that they want me to be a part of and they're like

167
00:14:52,060 --> 00:14:57,340
There was no second scripts, but then the agent saw a dead bee on the windows

168
00:14:57,340 --> 00:15:02,620
I was like, well, I tell you what I got it. I got somebody to pitch me a great idea and that's how it happens

169
00:15:02,700 --> 00:15:08,220
Okay, we could I be a bee last lives a month. Uh-huh a bee lives a month

170
00:15:08,220 --> 00:15:10,900
So the there's ten episodes

171
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:16,540
The bees gonna die of natural causes at the that has to be we're headed towards a Charlotte's Web

172
00:15:16,540 --> 00:15:22,020
There's a big problem in filming. Yeah. Yeah, we can't these bees keep dying. We have to go faster

173
00:15:22,300 --> 00:15:25,140
I'm so tired of trading these bees how to do a punchline

174
00:15:25,860 --> 00:15:28,780
But Rowan just kept eating the bees. He just

175
00:15:28,780 --> 00:15:51,680
He was gonna die anyways, it's me Rowan Atkinson. I don't know who Rowan Atkinson is. I wish the listeners have been here the first time

176
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:56,160
I looked at the image because honestly, it's the most it's one of the most powerful images

177
00:15:56,160 --> 00:16:02,400
I've seen in quite some time in terms of just like the raw potential of man. How how is it?

178
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:05,200
Can I ask a question?

179
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:09,040
How is it ten?

180
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:18,020
How how is it not I was gonna say a movie but even to like let's say

181
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:24,640
85 minutes a movie a movie makes sense. I see we're not talking about it if it's a movie. No, absolutely a movie

182
00:16:24,640 --> 00:16:31,680
It's like oh, whatever. Yes, we've seen that it's called Mouse Hut. It was good. It was great. I love that movie

183
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:33,840
Is he allergic to bees? Oh

184
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:38,320
That does give the bee a fighting chance, which I appreciate. He has like one shot

185
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:45,600
Yeah, that's what maybe the bee is like stolen his social security number and it's it's like, oh, okay

186
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:50,800
I wear a bit of a standoff your bee. I don't want you to ruin my credit. Yeah, I could see that

187
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:56,460
Oh, it could be a what about Bob kind of scenario where at first the whole family's like get rid of that bee

188
00:16:56,460 --> 00:16:59,260
But then the family was like, yeah, you know what? I actually like this bee

189
00:16:59,780 --> 00:17:03,060
Reincarnated wife. I'm enjoying imagining Rowan Atkinson

190
00:17:03,740 --> 00:17:09,300
Reaching for his podcast volume knob just turning it all the way down and he keeps turning a little back up to see if we're still

191
00:17:09,300 --> 00:17:22,820
Talking about it. Oh god, they're still okay. Please just do a Munch Squad. Get me back. Hey, hello. Hello. It's me. Rowan Atkinson. I love it if you all stop talking about my movies

192
00:17:22,820 --> 00:17:25,460
I'm spiraling. I just need to eat a few bees

193
00:17:26,340 --> 00:17:33,140
That'll that'll even me out. Yeah, I just need some I'm way down. I just need to level up. No, no, you've been clean for months

194
00:17:33,140 --> 00:17:39,220
I'm hungry. I'm gonna chomp down some bees or as I call them honey gushes, you know, they don't

195
00:17:39,540 --> 00:17:44,580
The honey's not in. Rowan, you can have some ants. It's all we've got in the house. You know, that won't get me there

196
00:17:46,460 --> 00:17:53,100
All right, my favorite brothers have ruined my movie. It's actually ten episodes Rowan. Boys, you're getting a little silly

197
00:17:53,100 --> 00:17:58,620
We need to calm down. It's ten episodes Rowan. Wait, how is it ten episodes? Okay, I don't remember that

198
00:17:58,620 --> 00:18:03,740
I'm gonna I'm gonna put out a thing. This just says how we should do a shirt

199
00:18:03,740 --> 00:18:05,740
That just says how's it ten?

200
00:18:05,740 --> 00:18:07,740
How's it ten?

201
00:18:08,220 --> 00:18:14,240
Okay, let's let's start the show I'm not feeling like doing a war with grandpa. No, we're not grant we're not gonna war

202
00:18:14,740 --> 00:18:16,740
war with grandpa as

203
00:18:17,060 --> 00:18:24,200
I mean, I will say it is sad because if anything was deserving. Yeah, it would be man versus bee but like

204
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:29,340
We have a long road, you know, we have a lot of build-up to this. There's gonna be a trailer

205
00:18:30,260 --> 00:18:32,140
In a different universe though

206
00:18:32,140 --> 00:18:39,100
I would love an entire episode of us doing a ten episode breakdown purely on spec of trying to figure out like, okay

207
00:18:39,100 --> 00:18:42,500
So what could you have one? What would you do an F1 and then F2?

208
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:45,860
How do you what's the bad is quickly what this episode is becoming?

209
00:18:45,860 --> 00:18:49,900
No, we're not letting it happen. No, no, we would never but what no

210
00:18:49,900 --> 00:18:56,340
How is it not even if we joke about it three times it comes real there's a lemonade stand on my college campus that is

211
00:18:56,340 --> 00:18:57,640
Handing out free cups of lemonade nice

212
00:18:57,640 --> 00:19:00,180
I would love to approach them and receive a free drink

213
00:19:00,180 --> 00:19:04,180
But there's something strange one of the people working at the tables wearing a rainbow clown wig

214
00:19:05,540 --> 00:19:10,900
And a red nose and the other is holding a large video camera. Oh, no, who has those?

215
00:19:13,260 --> 00:19:18,020
It's a phone now, okay, they're filming everyone who walks by or approaches the table

216
00:19:18,020 --> 00:19:22,220
I've seen several people approach the table and although everyone seems equally confused

217
00:19:22,220 --> 00:19:24,940
They all received their free cups of lemonade and walked away unscathed

218
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:30,500
Brothers am I good to get my free lemonade? I don't want to be pranked or put into a YouTube video of some sort

219
00:19:30,540 --> 00:19:34,940
What is the catch to this and that's from limiting up lover in LA and it's all I can think about now

220
00:19:34,940 --> 00:19:36,860
So I really really hope that they did

221
00:19:36,860 --> 00:19:41,820
I do need I'm about to tell them not to but I hope that they did because I need to know what happened

222
00:19:41,820 --> 00:19:44,980
Hey guys, I still have that one image of their own accent up on my computer. I

223
00:19:44,980 --> 00:19:46,980
Have to close it

224
00:19:47,220 --> 00:19:51,540
I promise you we'll be talking about man versus be a lot more in the lead-up to the series

225
00:19:51,540 --> 00:19:54,580
We are the brand ambassadors. Yeah, I did get a call

226
00:19:55,740 --> 00:20:01,080
Street scene. Okay. Here's the thing. What else could it be?

227
00:20:02,180 --> 00:20:08,180
if not some sort of prank or I mean, I guess it could be like a

228
00:20:08,180 --> 00:20:15,540
You come up and we're gonna like ask you your feelings of like, what do you think about the current college administration?

229
00:20:15,980 --> 00:20:18,140
Yeah, what do you think about Jesus Christ?

230
00:20:18,860 --> 00:20:19,360
Yeah

231
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:23,020
That's and that's always on the table this group and they're like

232
00:20:23,020 --> 00:20:26,780
We're really out there changing some hearts and minds out there with our cold lemon drink

233
00:20:26,900 --> 00:20:30,760
By the way, I thought about this the other day colleges should offer one class

234
00:20:30,760 --> 00:20:38,120
That's just called like Avia's professor pick support Bible just I think that would be nice just to give that to them

235
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:43,280
That would be dope because then you would have a place for the strong ex-marine

236
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:50,580
Who stands up and punches the professor so hard he dies and everybody gets saved and he's like that was from Jesus

237
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:53,280
engineer that sort of on a

238
00:20:54,360 --> 00:20:59,560
You know institutional level that would just be nice to give that to them, you know

239
00:20:59,560 --> 00:21:02,160
Just night. I think naughty would appreciate it

240
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:09,280
Okay, but by them you mean people who don't like who think that's all that happens in colleges

241
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:14,000
Yeah, sure. That's why the rainbow wig

242
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,040
I mean, that's what I mean

243
00:21:16,040 --> 00:21:20,400
I don't know why we need to pick apart the hue of the clown wig is a clown wig

244
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:26,680
They're wearing a clown nose and a clown wig. Okay, but that's what I'm saying. It's like if not a prank

245
00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:30,320
Who puts that on and thinks this will draw them in?

246
00:21:31,080 --> 00:21:34,000
That can't be it. Now. I will say

247
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:38,280
It is noticeable. You know that you were talking about it, aren't you?

248
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,920
To to why is the lemonade free then?

249
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:47,880
Why lemonade huh

250
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:51,760
Why the camera why all the parts of it I hate this

251
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:57,160
Real quick because there's not a lot of context to go on here and I we do need to move on because this is not

252
00:21:57,160 --> 00:22:02,520
An advice situation. I do really though quickly want to hear from each of you your best guess

253
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:07,760
As to what is happening here? Okay, and then I can I am in that too?

254
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:15,120
I would like wow instantly best guess and would we take the free lemonade? Okay, I can answer the second part

255
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:19,640
No, no, I know how I'm a man. I'm 41 years old. I can get my own limit. Okay, great

256
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:21,780
The best guess is what's going on?

257
00:22:24,680 --> 00:22:30,120
If the person's walked away unscathed I think that they have set up the premise and

258
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:31,920
forgotten

259
00:22:31,920 --> 00:22:34,720
That you also need some sort of punchline. They're just hoping

260
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:42,680
Something funny happens. Okay. My guess is this is a like a sociology class and they are

261
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:46,440
Showing how much are like survival

262
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:48,520
instincts have dulled

263
00:22:48,520 --> 00:22:56,440
To a point where we're accepting lemonade from from clowns. Oh, I like that too. Okay. I think there's a YouTube channel called piss boys

264
00:22:57,840 --> 00:23:03,720
Okay, I can see where you're going with this but it piss boys would have better equipment

265
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:10,960
I like Justin's because I believe a school still has a big video. Stop your mind told your brain told you to say out loud

266
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:17,180
That's wrong because piss boys would have better equipment than that. Yeah, this boys would be a popular

267
00:23:17,180 --> 00:23:18,420
stop

268
00:23:18,420 --> 00:23:19,820
Why?

269
00:23:19,820 --> 00:23:21,180
Why not?

270
00:23:21,180 --> 00:23:25,860
Travis Travis you were so quick to shit on my thing and

271
00:23:26,500 --> 00:23:33,140
You and your reasoning for it was his boys the imaginary YouTube channel would you are professional than that?

272
00:23:33,420 --> 00:23:35,420
Yeah, I would have more success

273
00:23:35,900 --> 00:23:39,060
I spent we all spend a lot of time on the internet government

274
00:23:39,060 --> 00:23:41,820
You can't tell me that a channel called piss boys wouldn't be breaking it

275
00:23:41,820 --> 00:23:47,220
But I feel like you're doing a lot of talking and not listening and critical thinking. Yeah. Thank you, Griffin

276
00:23:47,220 --> 00:23:52,100
I think that piss boys would not be a good YouTube channel Travis. Okay. Why is that?

277
00:23:52,860 --> 00:23:53,860
because the

278
00:23:53,860 --> 00:24:00,040
Because this the joke that they are doing here is that they walk up and the clown says want free lemonade and someone takes it

279
00:24:00,040 --> 00:24:04,780
And they say it's piss and then the person's like then I don't want it and then the clowns like it's not piss

280
00:24:04,780 --> 00:24:09,860
And then that's good and then they see if the person drinks it or not. Oh, that's five million hits

281
00:24:09,860 --> 00:24:16,180
Let's see. Justin has a link to oh, okay. Justin has his boys. That's how you pronounce it. Oh, okay

282
00:24:16,180 --> 00:24:21,500
I just found that I searched YouTube to see if there was already a piss boys channel. There's not yet

283
00:24:21,820 --> 00:24:23,820
There's a band. Oh

284
00:24:25,500 --> 00:24:28,580
Okay, all right moving on yeah, let's go

285
00:24:29,540 --> 00:24:34,300
They publish every Tuesday and Thursday by the way, if anyone wants to check out their content, it's incredible

286
00:24:34,340 --> 00:24:38,820
Some of it is piss related, but they also do some like how to DIY stuff around the house

287
00:24:38,820 --> 00:24:41,260
I'm witnessing and there's a lot of money by the way

288
00:24:41,260 --> 00:24:43,660
It was a Christian thing the Christians witnessing to you or something

289
00:24:43,660 --> 00:24:43,900
Yeah

290
00:24:43,900 --> 00:24:47,860
A friend of mine has been looking to buy an older TV to play her SNES on the other day

291
00:24:47,860 --> 00:24:49,860
My boss I believe it's renowned sneeze

292
00:24:49,980 --> 00:24:56,100
The other day my boss had a pristine Kurt on the floor of her office. Sorry. That's a CRD. I

293
00:24:56,860 --> 00:25:00,260
I asked about it and she said she was waiting for her husband to take it to Goodwill

294
00:25:00,260 --> 00:25:02,620
I texted my friend to ask if she wanted a free TV. Of course

295
00:25:02,620 --> 00:25:06,380
She said yes when I went back to my boss to tell her I would take it off her hands. She was thrilled

296
00:25:06,380 --> 00:25:09,620
She then asked how much my friend was willing to pay for it. I

297
00:25:10,980 --> 00:25:14,420
Had already told my friend it was free. So I panicked and said I would see what I could do

298
00:25:15,100 --> 00:25:17,860
Brothers the TV is now sitting in my house waiting to be picked up

299
00:25:17,860 --> 00:25:19,580
I don't want to take it back to work

300
00:25:19,580 --> 00:25:25,140
But if I asked my notoriously cheap friend to pay she won't want it. Do I have to pay for this TV now?

301
00:25:25,460 --> 00:25:30,180
Can I just not mention it to my boss again? I'm a broke college student, but I really want to play Super Mario

302
00:25:30,340 --> 00:25:35,260
Please help that's for financially flustered in the Finger Lakes here. Hey right off the bat

303
00:25:35,260 --> 00:25:37,260
Can I just say that's why she's the boss?

304
00:25:37,660 --> 00:25:38,820
Yeah

305
00:25:38,820 --> 00:25:40,820
Okay, she sees a deal

306
00:25:41,660 --> 00:25:43,660
She's working it, right?

307
00:25:43,820 --> 00:25:51,300
Yeah, I mean here's the thing if you want the true experience of playing

308
00:25:51,900 --> 00:25:53,900
fucking

309
00:25:54,540 --> 00:26:01,620
You know, dr. Crankenstein 3d or like whatever the old cool SNES games are you gotta go she's islands

310
00:26:01,620 --> 00:26:08,820
I'm pretty sure dr. Crankenstein is wonderful laboratory 3d is the game that I was thinking of they came on the same

311
00:26:09,700 --> 00:26:14,820
Cartridge it was like a half and half. Well, I know that they did the cartridge

312
00:26:15,740 --> 00:26:22,940
That was part Chrono Trigger part. Dr. Crankenstein's wonderful. Yeah, but on the back of it was Yoshi's Island if you turned it around

313
00:26:23,260 --> 00:26:30,380
Yeah, if you put the card in backwards if you put it in upside down as Yoshi's cookie. Yeah, it's a cool cartridge

314
00:26:30,380 --> 00:26:33,100
It was if he blew in it. It was a game genie

315
00:26:33,300 --> 00:26:37,700
Yeah, and it made a harmonica noise probably but it was a literal genie that came out. Yeah

316
00:26:38,100 --> 00:26:44,100
Yeah, but he played games with you, but he would grant your wishes in all these like really ironic terrible way

317
00:26:44,100 --> 00:26:46,680
Yeah, yeah while he beat you at Mario Kart. So

318
00:26:47,860 --> 00:26:54,540
Man, I don't know. I get it. I get that lifestyle, right? There's something about like input lag

319
00:26:54,700 --> 00:26:58,700
That's why people like playing Smash Brothers on old-ass TVs

320
00:26:58,700 --> 00:27:02,820
Well, it's that I think it's the input. I don't know if the input lag is part

321
00:27:02,820 --> 00:27:06,060
I know that it's the the pixels are blurred

322
00:27:06,060 --> 00:27:12,180
If you if you use a CRT that has individual pixels being eliminated there at that you get the true

323
00:27:12,460 --> 00:27:17,140
prison at it, but on an LCD the the pixels are blurred because they're being I

324
00:27:17,420 --> 00:27:22,140
Say artificially rendered. They also probably don't want to worry about adapters for the cables guys

325
00:27:22,140 --> 00:27:28,460
That's probably they just have the one cable that plugs into an RCA hookup. You think that's what's going on here Jeff?

326
00:27:28,460 --> 00:27:30,780
Yes, Justin. That's a thousand percent what it is

327
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:32,980
Yeah, okay. All right

328
00:27:32,980 --> 00:27:33,820
That's what I said

329
00:27:33,820 --> 00:27:37,440
You guys are coming at this from your elite video game journalist days

330
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:40,620
And I'm like they don't want to go to the trouble of finding an adapter

331
00:27:40,620 --> 00:27:44,380
You're shooting from the hip with your your hot piss boys take. Yes. Thank you

332
00:27:44,380 --> 00:27:46,100
I'm trying to get on that channel so bad

333
00:27:46,100 --> 00:27:51,020
You guys who'd be so good for our brand if they would just have I I would say here's the here's the thing

334
00:27:51,020 --> 00:27:56,760
I this is my take. Yeah, I think that everything's fine because you already have the TV

335
00:27:56,760 --> 00:28:02,360
Right, so it's not like your boss said. Oh great. I'll hold on to it to it till you bring me the money

336
00:28:02,680 --> 00:28:08,760
You've got it. Wow. Okay, so like dropped it outside then went bang. I mean at this point

337
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:15,160
It's not a problem until it becomes a problem again. So I would just stop worrying about it if it was me

338
00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:18,880
Right cuz it's fine until it's not fine and then you can figure it out

339
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:26,920
Uh, yeah, that's not great advice. That's just not good. It kind of feels weird to say

340
00:28:26,920 --> 00:28:29,640
I'm gonna give this away to go. Well, I don't know wait

341
00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:35,640
I'll sell it like I guess you do you do you and you know, you get you I guess you got to chase the paper

342
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:37,160
but

343
00:28:37,160 --> 00:28:40,000
Nothing, nothing lost there. You know what I mean?

344
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:46,320
Now I will say Griffin to that point the boss didn't say you will have to pay for it

345
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:50,800
Or that will be $20 or whatever. They said how much would they pay for it?

346
00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:53,620
And you question asker could have said oh

347
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:55,760
nothing

348
00:28:55,760 --> 00:29:03,080
Right, like it was a very open-ended question with a possibility of zero dollars was an answer

349
00:29:04,560 --> 00:29:06,560
And so I that I

350
00:29:06,920 --> 00:29:11,060
There was a moment there that would have now I get it sometimes on the show

351
00:29:11,060 --> 00:29:17,880
We have to think about yeah, but we didn't do that. That wasn't what happened. I understand that but that's where I would have gone

352
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:22,120
Or just follow the husband to Goodwill and get it from there. Well, then you gotta buy it

353
00:29:22,440 --> 00:29:27,500
Or oh, okay. Yeah, you're right Justin when he starts to bring it in you come around the corner like yes

354
00:29:27,500 --> 00:29:31,180
I'm a good will employee. I'll take that right off your hands. Boom. No

355
00:29:31,680 --> 00:29:34,640
There's no ethical or no issues

356
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:41,000
What so ever Travis just said and while you're at it walk in there and just keep telling people you're a good will employee

357
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:42,560
Just take some stuff

358
00:29:42,560 --> 00:29:45,600
It's perfect. It's a good way of building goodwill. Oh

359
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:48,440
Hey

360
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:54,160
Griffin do you have anything for us this week anything? I mean the wizard came to me in a dream last night

361
00:29:54,840 --> 00:29:56,840
whoa, yeah

362
00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:02,440
Daniel sent this one and thank you Daniel and it's not it's not them. I mean, it's not the most not rages

363
00:30:02,440 --> 00:30:04,080
one

364
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:07,480
But I found it fascinating and it is how to become a saint. Oh

365
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:12,520
I have wondered of course you have yeah

366
00:30:12,520 --> 00:30:13,060
I mean

367
00:30:13,060 --> 00:30:13,800
It's me

368
00:30:13,800 --> 00:30:19,120
Saints are people that Christians particularly Roman Catholics believe are the holiest and virtuous servants of God and that they are now in heaven

369
00:30:19,320 --> 00:30:25,320
Saints are celebrated with prayers days on the holy calendar and an art and iconography on churches and their lives are revered studied as

370
00:30:25,880 --> 00:30:28,640
Examples for the rest of the faithful to follow I that's cool

371
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:33,760
There's also a lot of those places that will like make those big votive candles, but sure sure sure

372
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:36,120
But it'll have you know, like a fucking

373
00:30:38,600 --> 00:30:40,600
Be Arthur be Arthur

374
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:43,840
Some of these real sinners

375
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:48,500
Anyway, oh step one. It was be Arthur a real sinner. Yeah, she

376
00:30:48,920 --> 00:30:55,600
Did all kinds of blood rituals so the awesome first step become Catholic and you can just do that

377
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:59,520
You can just go do that go hit up the go hit up your local

378
00:31:00,160 --> 00:31:03,680
Parish or whatever and you're like, I would love to be Catholic and it juice

379
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:08,440
Don't you have to take didn't they try to make you do like Catholic mostly Catholic at this point, right?

380
00:31:08,440 --> 00:31:14,960
I added a little bit of training but not by mean like just so they would let me get married in the church

381
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:18,320
We had to meet with a priest. Yeah, and he had to tell us the real meaning

382
00:31:18,760 --> 00:31:23,340
Now Justin was this a lot like that one scene and there's a very important scene in cinema

383
00:31:23,340 --> 00:31:29,460
In Street Fighter when they were trying to make Blanca evil and they filled it almost all the way up with evil

384
00:31:29,460 --> 00:31:34,740
But then the last moment it switched to good was that like you converting to Catholicism and the last moment

385
00:31:34,740 --> 00:31:40,100
It was basically exactly a shot-for-shot remake of the 2007 film license to win

386
00:31:41,140 --> 00:31:46,900
Robin Williams is the Reverend. Okay, who's getting John Krasinski and Mandy Moore married? Okay, I do

387
00:31:46,900 --> 00:31:48,500
I remember it vividly

388
00:31:48,500 --> 00:31:53,440
But you're saying it wasn't a shot-for-shot remake of the 1994 film Street Fighter in the scene where they try to make

389
00:31:53,980 --> 00:31:57,700
100% evil, but he and when the priest was like you want to get married on a Tuesday?

390
00:31:58,780 --> 00:32:00,620
Yeah

391
00:32:00,620 --> 00:32:02,700
That's a good Street Fighter movie joke

392
00:32:05,460 --> 00:32:11,420
Yeah, everyone got that one for sure, okay, so here we go live an exemplary and pious life that's one step

393
00:32:11,700 --> 00:32:14,180
That's a single step. This is just like live

394
00:32:14,180 --> 00:32:22,140
So right, it's so good and spend all of your days on this earth fighting against poverty and oppression and devoting your life

395
00:32:22,140 --> 00:32:23,540
to scholarly study

396
00:32:23,540 --> 00:32:26,740
Did I start that now? I think it might

397
00:32:32,780 --> 00:32:40,300
Say Paul did some shit, right? I mean he came around he did his was a pretty extreme example

398
00:32:40,300 --> 00:32:43,620
Example, but sure. Yeah, okay

399
00:32:43,620 --> 00:32:50,500
So next next step and I love the wording perform at least two miracles. Okay. Okay. Yeah

400
00:32:50,500 --> 00:32:52,500
Yeah, you know like if you do

401
00:32:53,060 --> 00:32:54,340
five

402
00:32:54,340 --> 00:32:59,180
That's cool. I feel like you get into a case where like if you do too many miracles people are gonna get a little bit

403
00:32:59,340 --> 00:33:03,220
Suspicious two is kind I would say two to three is the sweet spot

404
00:33:03,220 --> 00:33:06,800
Yeah, I think once you hit four or more people are gonna be like we get it

405
00:33:06,800 --> 00:33:11,400
But like they have to there's like a ratification process that takes place

406
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:15,520
So like if you want to be safe there might it might make sense to do

407
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:20,520
Two or three or even four if you feel like maybe one of them isn't gonna count

408
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:25,160
And I just take it from me if you're like and then the third

409
00:33:25,240 --> 00:33:29,780
Eminem in a row that I got out of the package was blue. They don't probably not gonna cut them

410
00:33:29,780 --> 00:33:31,780
They don't take that one. What's cool

411
00:33:31,780 --> 00:33:37,980
It is a little bit like the Guinness Book of World Records where they send someone to watch it like, okay do it

412
00:33:37,980 --> 00:33:42,820
Oh, yeah six in one minute. He's in which is pretty cool. They don't actually do it like that for reasons

413
00:33:42,820 --> 00:33:44,340
We'll get into very very shortly

414
00:33:44,340 --> 00:33:49,820
But some examples unexplainable hearing healing of the incurably sick wounded or dying is a classic

415
00:33:49,820 --> 00:33:53,820
It says as is interceding to miraculously stop or rescue people from an impending disaster

416
00:33:54,300 --> 00:34:00,540
You don't technically have to perform these miracles while alive. You could intercede from heaven to make your miracles happen instead

417
00:34:00,540 --> 00:34:07,100
Oh, that sounds good. That sounds like the easiest one. Tell me if this next step sounds good. Step four die

418
00:34:08,260 --> 00:34:11,860
Hmm. I wasn't planning on that one though. I'm not gonna do that one

419
00:34:11,860 --> 00:34:14,860
No getting around this one st. Hood is a posthumous title

420
00:34:14,860 --> 00:34:19,620
In fact, the organization process only begins a minimum of five years after the subjects death

421
00:34:20,460 --> 00:34:26,700
What? Oh, man, that's so long after if but this is the tricky needle to thread is if possible

422
00:34:26,700 --> 00:34:30,940
Try to be martyred for your faith. I do not see how I could get myself in a situation

423
00:34:31,860 --> 00:34:36,860
But if I was gonna go out, that's not bad. I mean, yeah sure

424
00:34:39,020 --> 00:34:45,740
So, okay, here's here's okay. So remember now at this step there's lots more things to do here, but you are dead now

425
00:34:45,740 --> 00:34:55,320
I'll try to keep that in mind. Okay navigating the canonization process as a dead skeleton through the ground

426
00:34:56,780 --> 00:34:59,620
Don't get up and dance around in the ground

427
00:35:00,100 --> 00:35:03,780
Frown upon don't climb out of your grave and start to kill people

428
00:35:06,260 --> 00:35:13,100
Does not work make me a saint or I'll make you a skeleton too that will not work threats do not work in this process

429
00:35:13,100 --> 00:35:18,100
They don't like it develop a local quote devotion of people who remember your holiness and pray to you

430
00:35:18,100 --> 00:35:20,260
You've got I think set this one up ahead of time

431
00:35:21,380 --> 00:35:26,740
Have you really helps to have like a confederate in this he's like, hey, do you guys remember Travis? Yeah

432
00:35:26,740 --> 00:35:29,060
I ruled right. Let's get together and talk about him

433
00:35:29,060 --> 00:35:33,880
Have your local bishop initiate a cause with the Vatican's congregation for st. Hood causes again

434
00:35:33,880 --> 00:35:37,600
This is gonna be a ball that you got to start rolling five years prior

435
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:42,120
Right at least right before your worm food, bro

436
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:48,760
Because it's gonna this part it takes a while get investigated by the church a postulate will pour over the details of your life

437
00:35:48,760 --> 00:35:50,760
Works and your writings. Oh boy

438
00:35:52,600 --> 00:35:58,200
We're gonna have to erase a lot of content from the old interest this guy does a lot of war stuff

439
00:35:59,840 --> 00:36:05,640
Hey, I really quick the last like beatified person

440
00:36:05,640 --> 00:36:10,400
Yeah, you guys know my mother Teresa, right or st. Teresa know

441
00:36:11,320 --> 00:36:15,360
So I just real quick want to mention something. Yeah, so she did two

442
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:17,600
Miracles, right?

443
00:36:17,600 --> 00:36:23,640
Anima and yeah, you gotta do two miracles and then there's somebody like this this person

444
00:36:25,160 --> 00:36:27,000
Named Monica

445
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:32,280
Had a tumor and she's in India then she saw a light emanating from a photo of Mother Teresa

446
00:36:32,280 --> 00:36:36,520
and then a medallion from Mother Teresa was put on her abdomen and

447
00:36:36,840 --> 00:36:40,800
The tumor went away and it says in this story here on biography

448
00:36:41,160 --> 00:36:45,200
That theologians and medical experts who delved into the case found though

449
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:48,720
There was no earthly explanation for Bessra's recovery

450
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:52,920
Huh and her cure was therefore attributed to the miraculous intervention of Mother Teresa. All right

451
00:36:53,840 --> 00:36:59,660
That's cool. And the miracle was recognized by the Vatican in 2002 and there's another one just like this in

452
00:36:59,660 --> 00:37:01,660
2008 uh-huh

453
00:37:06,500 --> 00:37:11,380
Somebody should have said something about that the cool. Yeah

454
00:37:11,980 --> 00:37:16,300
Like no, I mean like hey big news everybody

455
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:23,060
We have proof we got a miracle like that's huge. Like I feel like that should have been maybe Twitter was

456
00:37:24,580 --> 00:37:26,580
How the fuck were we supposed to know about it

457
00:37:26,580 --> 00:37:30,860
I also say this the end result of that. It's hard for me not to

458
00:37:31,820 --> 00:37:38,220
Throw a little shade on old Teresa there. I'm like, so just keep do it. Why did you stop more medallions?

459
00:37:39,460 --> 00:37:44,320
That's a really cool thing to do a lot of juice it uses a lot of

460
00:37:45,020 --> 00:37:47,260
Well, that's how we need to work on more renewable energy

461
00:37:48,260 --> 00:37:54,620
Have your first miracle verified and beatified by the Pope. So this one's got to go way up the flagpole essentially

462
00:37:54,620 --> 00:37:59,140
Oh, hey Pope. It's me Travis. First of all, cut some of that shit out second of all

463
00:37:59,140 --> 00:38:04,120
Yeah, you know what I'm talking about. I got a last-minute reservation for 17

464
00:38:04,580 --> 00:38:12,180
I'm like I'm talking like an hour before dinner. So if you want to fast-track this process where it doesn't matter where?

465
00:38:12,180 --> 00:38:14,020
It doesn't matter stop

466
00:38:14,020 --> 00:38:18,600
Applebee's it was a second, but it was a lot of people last-minute. It was a big out

467
00:38:18,600 --> 00:38:21,980
It was a small Applebee's and then oh and then when they brought the check

468
00:38:21,980 --> 00:38:25,720
They had left two of the desserts off. So we got it for cheaper than excepted

469
00:38:25,720 --> 00:38:32,300
So so pretty cool night pretty cool next step get that second and I was not hung over the next day

470
00:38:32,300 --> 00:38:34,660
Even though I had eight Brutus's. Okay

471
00:38:35,180 --> 00:38:39,920
All right, get that second miracle verified and become a saint. That's one step

472
00:38:41,180 --> 00:38:44,540
Easy easy if you got the first if you can do one miracle

473
00:38:44,540 --> 00:38:48,140
Yeah, I bet you can do two and then they're already bought in at that point

474
00:38:48,140 --> 00:38:51,040
And then it gets not fun at the end where it says answer prayers now that

475
00:38:51,040 --> 00:38:54,940
Catholics are officially permitted to venerate you they can ask you to speak with God on their behalf

476
00:38:55,160 --> 00:38:57,360
Don't I'm gonna I'm gonna be so busy

477
00:38:58,320 --> 00:39:05,400
Cranking out medallions. I do not have time to make sure that your kid wins the soccer game once I get into that

478
00:39:05,400 --> 00:39:10,480
Let's be honest awesome VIP area that must exist in heaven for Saints. Yeah

479
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:14,760
I doubt I'm dipping out to answer a call on my cell phone

480
00:39:14,760 --> 00:39:19,280
You know what I mean? Like I need a middle to be the middle man to just be like, that's true

481
00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:24,480
Lord, you got to check out this one. You probably just make it a little baby. Jonathan needs a win

482
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:30,000
He is so shitty at soccer. You would not believe it. Could you send some angels down? We've done it before

483
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:35,200
Just let the angels help. No, not this time. Okay. Sorry. I'll let him know

484
00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:41,680
Yeah, he said uh, you got it the angels would be there, but no one could see them powers in you all along

485
00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:44,720
Bye, what miracles do you guys think you could?

486
00:39:44,720 --> 00:39:50,640
Do we'll say humously not posthumously, okay

487
00:39:52,200 --> 00:39:55,080
Let's see, um, I could float

488
00:39:55,640 --> 00:40:00,440
Okay, like David Blaine style. No, not really like on water

489
00:40:01,400 --> 00:40:06,640
Well lay down and no cuz everyone kind of floats in water. I would I mean I can't do it

490
00:40:06,640 --> 00:40:08,640
I'm too dense with muscle, but I

491
00:40:08,640 --> 00:40:15,920
I would make you float. Yeah, that would be a good one. I made better people than you have tried. What's the miracle?

492
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:18,160
I'm in my really muscly brother Travis. Yeah

493
00:40:19,680 --> 00:40:24,000
He said he couldn't do it cuz it's through an all-starch diet and eight months of hard work

494
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:28,480
I made it so he would I I actually I did a miracle recently where

495
00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:37,760
At first there only seemed to be enough content for one episode and I made it into ten episodes before their very eyes. That

496
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:44,460
Way there would be enough man versus be for the whole congregation. Yeah

497
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:50,880
My past out of the scripts and I said these are for you this take of it. It is not very good

498
00:40:51,480 --> 00:40:53,480
Episodes two through ten is where I carried

499
00:40:53,480 --> 00:41:01,120
Yeah, anyway, that's how to become a saint and I you know, I think that's neat

500
00:41:01,960 --> 00:41:03,960
Go for it. Yeah

501
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:08,360
Anyway, take it from me podcaster Griffin back Roy. This is swell

502
00:41:08,360 --> 00:41:11,720

Guys the other day

562
00:46:17,780 --> 00:46:21,500
Something occurred to me and I would like to issue guys a bit of a challenge

563
00:46:22,220 --> 00:46:25,380
Okay, I think and I've been thinking about this a lot

564
00:46:26,340 --> 00:46:31,300
In the straight white cis male category. I think of the three of us

565
00:46:31,300 --> 00:46:37,540
I am the most quintessential millennial down and I feel very strongly the other day. I was mowing my lawn

566
00:46:37,540 --> 00:46:41,860
I was wearing a Cobra Kai t-shirt that I've owned since before the TV show came out

567
00:46:41,860 --> 00:46:48,060
Thank you, and I was listening to music on my iPhone without headphones. Just blasting it out of my pocket. Heck

568
00:46:48,060 --> 00:46:52,460
Yeah, and the music I was listening to was a combination of his playlist of matchbox 20

569
00:46:53,100 --> 00:46:58,540
Incubus Dave Matthews BAM Jesus and I was like, oh, this is it. This is the height of it

570
00:46:58,540 --> 00:47:02,980
Oh and my sunglasses they had a little strap around the back so they wouldn't fall off my sweaty ears

571
00:47:02,980 --> 00:47:04,980
What is this this?

572
00:47:04,980 --> 00:47:11,060
Unforced error you are just saying I've reached the point that hit a point where I was like, I've hit it

573
00:47:11,060 --> 00:47:12,660
This is peak

574
00:47:12,660 --> 00:47:14,660
millennial down energy

575
00:47:14,980 --> 00:47:16,140
in

576
00:47:16,140 --> 00:47:19,900
brackets straight white cis male in brackets what

577
00:47:20,500 --> 00:47:26,020
Okay, is there a bit associated with well, I had kind of thought you guys would step up and back

578
00:47:26,020 --> 00:47:30,660
I think I'm the most quintessential but now I'm just kind of hanging out there. Yeah

579
00:47:32,700 --> 00:47:36,340
It's interesting Griffin and I are sort of peering at you through the comedy glass

580
00:47:36,340 --> 00:47:43,340
Wondering wondering why this exhibit is here. Well, I kind of thought that it would become a thing where you guys would talk about your

581
00:47:44,420 --> 00:47:48,900
quintessential millennial dad now present that presumption is extremely millennial

582
00:47:49,340 --> 00:47:54,660
Thank you so much. See now I'm re-energized because I just like to be peak anything

583
00:47:54,660 --> 00:47:59,020
I think is what it comes to you, but I also wanted to be a competition. I don't want to just hand it to me. I

584
00:48:00,860 --> 00:48:05,500
As long as we're I want to get this train back on the road with a little anecdote that happened to me this week

585
00:48:05,500 --> 00:48:09,220
Okay, I didn't realize it was off the road. I thought okay, it was way off

586
00:48:10,140 --> 00:48:11,860
Yeah

587
00:48:11,860 --> 00:48:15,180
my daughter is for one of them and she

588
00:48:15,980 --> 00:48:20,180
Has this thing she's been doing lately where rather than just sit on the potty?

589
00:48:20,620 --> 00:48:23,500
She puts like her whole ass in

590
00:48:24,220 --> 00:48:27,660
Toilet while she's peeing. It's safer that way

591
00:48:28,420 --> 00:48:33,320
Honey, you got to stop doing that. She said why and I said well the

592
00:48:33,320 --> 00:48:36,320
germs will get out of the potty water and

593
00:48:37,240 --> 00:48:40,880
Get into your body through your butt. Uh-huh. Ah

594
00:48:41,800 --> 00:48:44,800
Up the stairs right into the stink mouth

595
00:48:49,760 --> 00:48:52,520
The future it was I

596
00:48:53,440 --> 00:49:00,680
Had to lay down cuz up the stairs right into the sink mouth. I mean, it's just so powerful. It's like powerful powerful

597
00:49:00,680 --> 00:49:02,680
powerful wordplay

598
00:49:05,040 --> 00:49:10,720
I haven't done anything weird or bad or uncool. I just

599
00:49:11,800 --> 00:49:13,800
pretty normal stuff

600
00:49:15,760 --> 00:49:21,440
How about another question, yeah, I bought a new belt and I was so glad

601
00:49:22,160 --> 00:49:27,440
To have it that I considered swapping out my old one as I walked down the street leaving the store

602
00:49:27,440 --> 00:49:33,720
This is my brand. I didn't do it cuz I cuz I this would be me leaving the store

603
00:49:33,720 --> 00:49:37,560
And this thought would be in my subconscious this belts gonna fix everything

604
00:49:38,680 --> 00:49:44,560
Here it is. I gotta get this belt on right now. Hold up my pants and my emotions

605
00:49:44,880 --> 00:49:46,880
This is gonna fix it. I

606
00:49:47,600 --> 00:49:53,680
Didn't do it cuz I feared it was a little too close to actually removing my pants or signaling to others that the pants could

607
00:49:53,680 --> 00:49:59,680
Come off would I have been justified to swap the belt and toss it in the garbage or is that too risqué for a public?

608
00:49:59,880 --> 00:50:04,960
Sidewalk that's from new belt in New York. How bad is your old belt that you're gonna throw in the garbage?

609
00:50:05,080 --> 00:50:10,800
Has it reached that point cuz then yes, well, I mean you I don't know why they're buying a new belt

610
00:50:10,800 --> 00:50:15,000
Yeah, this is a good point Justin because I don't know I've bought multiple

611
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:16,160
I own multiple belts

612
00:50:16,160 --> 00:50:23,600
But I've never bought one while wearing one because I never think that's on the time when you think about do I need a belt?

613
00:50:23,600 --> 00:50:26,040
That's not it's really hot. I

614
00:50:29,480 --> 00:50:35,840
Something's going wrong in the wiring of this belt. There's a short somewhere in here. It's overheating on a regular basis

615
00:50:35,840 --> 00:50:37,840
I have to keep pouring water into the old radiator

616
00:50:38,080 --> 00:50:44,760
The belt the belts that I wear on what I realized I was getting these tiny these tiny holes

617
00:50:44,760 --> 00:50:50,240
In the front of my t-shirts and it's from why the belt but yeah would repeatedly

618
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:52,640
scrape against

619
00:50:52,640 --> 00:50:54,160
counters

620
00:50:54,160 --> 00:51:00,960
So now I have I found these special belts that are elastic and they have flat plastic clips

621
00:51:01,240 --> 00:51:05,460
On the front and it looks it looks like a pretty looks cool. It looks like

622
00:51:05,460 --> 00:51:12,660
It's that kind of sounds like it Justin it looks like a prescription belt

623
00:51:12,660 --> 00:51:18,380
But it stretches way out way okay, and it doesn't hold my pants up very good

624
00:51:18,740 --> 00:51:26,000
But I did and it does not make the holes in my shirt. Uh-huh. Well, I'll slack. I'll slack you know

625
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:28,000
It's all right. It's cool

626
00:51:28,020 --> 00:51:33,440
Hey, here's the thing. It's a prescription. It's like a prescription. It's like a prescription belt. I get that I

627
00:51:33,440 --> 00:51:39,440
This is rare, but I will say new belt in New York. You are correct

628
00:51:40,200 --> 00:51:41,840
to a point

629
00:51:41,840 --> 00:51:47,760
Where if you engage in the visible action of beginning to remove your belt?

630
00:51:48,280 --> 00:51:54,920
Correct for that time until the new belt goes on. Yeah, anybody observing will think

631
00:51:55,760 --> 00:51:56,760
to

632
00:51:56,760 --> 00:52:02,080
Your is pay you are taking off your pants. You're just in the very early right taking off your pants

633
00:52:02,080 --> 00:52:03,680
Okay, you're in the preamble

634
00:52:03,680 --> 00:52:11,480
So until step two deviates from the expected outcome the expected outcome is and then pants

635
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:18,400
You're right. It does look like you're wearing juice. Sorry. I'm just looking at Justin's belt because it's the most busted thing

636
00:52:18,400 --> 00:52:20,200
I've ever seen it does look

637
00:52:20,200 --> 00:52:25,080
Like it looks like a lot of things it looks sort of like a restraint strap on a child stroller

638
00:52:25,080 --> 00:52:28,480
It looks like a fanny pack without the fanny pack

639
00:52:28,480 --> 00:52:33,800
Yeah, I also think it looks a little bit like you showed up to somewhere and they said oh we have a dress code here

640
00:52:33,800 --> 00:52:37,000
You have to wear a belt and you said I don't have a belt and they said well

641
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:43,960
We have some belts you could wear just to match the dress code. This is our simple. It's like that

642
00:52:43,960 --> 00:52:48,680
It's like the um hospital gown equivalent of of belts

643
00:52:48,680 --> 00:52:52,520
It looks like this isn't really doing much at least you got something

644
00:52:52,520 --> 00:52:53,920
It's like the 3d glasses

645
00:52:53,920 --> 00:52:59,520
Equivalent of a belt that you walked into a ride and they handed out belts that they expect you to give back at the end

646
00:52:59,520 --> 00:53:01,520
of the ride

647
00:53:02,320 --> 00:53:04,260
That is what this looks like to me

648
00:53:04,260 --> 00:53:09,360
It looks like a child has drawn their idea of a belt and then you've turned it into a reality

649
00:53:10,560 --> 00:53:15,360
It just doesn't um, it doesn't make the holes in my t-shirt. That's great. I love that about it

650
00:53:15,360 --> 00:53:18,180
I do love that for you. Could you announce?

651
00:53:19,080 --> 00:53:22,080
I'm not taking off right now. That is what would assign help

652
00:53:22,080 --> 00:53:24,240
What a side help

653
00:53:24,240 --> 00:53:29,600
It's been a while since I asked but if you made a sign that said just switching belts and you held it up or had

654
00:53:29,600 --> 00:53:32,560
Someone hold it up next to you. Could you loudly talk about like

655
00:53:33,360 --> 00:53:37,880
Can't wait to put on this new belt. Oh, yeah a new belt like prominently. Oh

656
00:53:38,580 --> 00:53:42,160
Yeah, I'll wear oh you should have done it in the store. I'll wear it out. I'll wear it out

657
00:53:42,160 --> 00:53:46,960
Can you throw away my old belt? Oh walk up to a stranger on the street grab by the shoulders and scream

658
00:53:46,960 --> 00:53:52,600
It's new belt day. It's new belt day everyone and switch out then they're like, well now

659
00:53:52,600 --> 00:53:55,520
I'm the weird one for not getting a new belt today and what's that?

660
00:53:55,520 --> 00:54:00,360
The belt industry has turned around what the economy's fixed all thanks to new belt day

661
00:54:00,680 --> 00:54:03,960
Yeah, could you find someone who doesn't have a belt and just be like, hey, brother

662
00:54:04,600 --> 00:54:11,520
You're on hard times. Here, please take my belt. No, these are overalls. No, they actually they're straps at the top here, brother

663
00:54:11,520 --> 00:54:14,960
No, raise your hands up brother like an airplane. Let me put this belt on

664
00:54:14,960 --> 00:54:21,160
I'll take the belt. I just don't I don't need it right this second. Am I it's a kind of an oh, you're oh, okay

665
00:54:21,160 --> 00:54:24,920
You're putting it around me like a hula hoop. Okay. Thank you for the belt

666
00:54:24,920 --> 00:54:30,160
I have a formal belt in black too. That's this exact thing, but it's black for formal occasions

667
00:54:30,160 --> 00:54:35,840
Well, okay, you can't just calling something formal doesn't make it formal does it? It's black. Okay

668
00:54:36,440 --> 00:54:39,460
That just means it's black doesn't mean it's formal

669
00:54:39,460 --> 00:54:44,900
Okay, I want to hear your honest evaluations of my belt Griffin go it sucks

670
00:54:56,020 --> 00:54:58,020
Shit I

671
00:54:58,420 --> 00:55:01,660
Want a much weed it sounds like it. Yeah, baby

672
00:55:01,660 --> 00:55:08,200
I want too much. Oh, I get it

673
00:55:09,620 --> 00:55:12,600
playful, this is our last episode before

674
00:55:13,420 --> 00:55:18,060
The big day and we haven't even mentioned it. Oh, right 420

675
00:55:18,060 --> 00:55:22,780
yeah, 420 is our this our last I mean, it's basically our 420 episode and

676
00:55:23,660 --> 00:55:28,820
This is a story about Winx. Everybody's getting into the biz. I just wanted to note the holiday

677
00:55:28,820 --> 00:55:31,660
Here's the press release from Wingstop

678
00:55:32,380 --> 00:55:40,140
Let's listen there. We stopped to offer blazed and glazed flavor for 420. Okay. Yeah, let's be blunt

679
00:55:40,140 --> 00:55:43,020
Let's be honest. Yeah, I love that. That's wordplay, baby

680
00:55:43,940 --> 00:55:47,820
Wingstop Inc knows their wings are the ultimate munchies

681
00:55:47,860 --> 00:55:54,340
Well, and that for I this hard to say yeah, by the way hard I do not want so many ways

682
00:55:54,340 --> 00:56:01,080
I don't want to be messy. No, no, and it's also a man like I got munchies don't down once chill

683
00:56:01,080 --> 00:56:04,420
Yeah, right cheetos. I just want to read those and Cheetos

684
00:56:04,780 --> 00:56:11,020
Could battle for the ultimate munchie a little bit of popcorn with some tahini and MSG on it. That's what I want

685
00:56:11,020 --> 00:56:13,020
I don't want meat sauce

686
00:56:13,500 --> 00:56:15,500
420 is a sin. I think jerky

687
00:56:16,340 --> 00:56:18,780
420 is a sacred holiday for our guests

688
00:56:18,780 --> 00:56:25,420
So don't let the fact that we put ink in the name of our company fool you we are down with marijuana

689
00:56:25,780 --> 00:56:30,500
so in celebration of the most chill day of the year the wing joint is

690
00:56:35,500 --> 00:56:38,340
It lets me know they're hip, you know what I mean, I can trust them

691
00:56:38,340 --> 00:56:42,820
It's definitely not cops in celebration of the most chill day of the year

692
00:56:42,820 --> 00:56:47,540
The wing joint is honoring their cannabis loving fans with a limited edition

693
00:56:47,540 --> 00:56:51,980
420 inspired flavor called blazed and glazed

694
00:56:52,780 --> 00:56:55,980
Available starting on April 18th in restaurants nationwide

695
00:56:56,740 --> 00:56:58,740
crafted with a blend of hemp seeds

696
00:56:59,500 --> 00:57:03,460
Terpenes strawberry and cayenne pepper. What are you doing over there?

697
00:57:05,100 --> 00:57:10,420
Some stuff laying around some different the new flavor is designed to taste like 420

698
00:57:10,780 --> 00:57:16,260
Capturing the herbal notes of the holiday and many even produce a mouth-tingling sensation

699
00:57:16,260 --> 00:57:23,900
Although and I think it's really cool that they put this in here. The flavor won't actually get you. Okay

700
00:57:24,340 --> 00:57:26,340
Well, all right, then

701
00:57:26,980 --> 00:57:31,720
Can I just say real quick and we talk about this a lot on this show, especially a month squad words mean things

702
00:57:31,720 --> 00:57:35,360
I don't think food can be limited edition, right?

703
00:57:35,360 --> 00:57:40,220
But you could say limited time, but unless you've only made like 12 of these wings

704
00:57:40,220 --> 00:57:46,500
We've made 12 of these wings come get them. They're $1,000 a piece. So

705
00:57:46,500 --> 00:57:52,660
It might produce a mouth-tingling sensation, but it won't get you high and I'm gonna I'm gonna need to hear more about this

706
00:57:52,660 --> 00:57:56,500
So let's check in with Marisa Corona. Thank you. I've been waiting officer

707
00:57:58,280 --> 00:58:03,700
Some of our biggest fans aren't just pairing their favorite wings with seasoned fries

708
00:58:03,700 --> 00:58:10,980
And then it says she rose her eyebrows suggestively for 35 straight, huh?

709
00:58:13,860 --> 00:58:20,740
While many brands are starting to give a nod to 420 we're going higher than ever this okay by

710
00:58:21,140 --> 00:58:25,640
Dedicating an entire flavor to it as the cannabis industry grows

711
00:58:25,940 --> 00:58:29,580
So does wing stops desire to engage this audience

712
00:58:29,580 --> 00:58:34,780
Huh and yet you're still treating it like a bunch of hippies in a van

713
00:58:35,220 --> 00:58:37,220
They are yeah, it's still

714
00:58:37,580 --> 00:58:39,020
Exactly. Oh

715
00:58:39,020 --> 00:58:41,020
We're playing fish music

716
00:58:41,900 --> 00:58:47,060
While wing stop is no stranger to weed culture. Jesus Christ alive

717
00:58:47,820 --> 00:58:53,560
We're oh, that's what I say when I walk into a room full of people smoking. I'm like, oh me

718
00:58:53,560 --> 00:59:00,220
I'm no stranger to weed culture. We're no strangers to weed culture. We drug test our employees probably I bet

719
00:59:00,980 --> 00:59:03,700
You know all the dirty things these perverts are

720
00:59:04,900 --> 00:59:09,640
This is the first year the brand has created a custom flavor in honor of the holiday

721
00:59:10,240 --> 00:59:17,720
Wing stops blazed and glazed flavor is available in restaurants nationwide starting on April 18th through the 20s. I should hope so

722
00:59:18,340 --> 00:59:20,340
or walls

723
00:59:20,460 --> 00:59:22,380
Starting May 3rd

724
00:59:22,380 --> 00:59:24,060
the flavor and

725
00:59:24,060 --> 00:59:32,380
Wingstop food truck will also meet celebrants at hippie Hill in San Francisco's Golden Gate Park on April 20th to infuse

726
00:59:32,380 --> 00:59:33,720
flavor

727
00:59:33,720 --> 00:59:35,720
Into the festival, okay

728
00:59:36,940 --> 00:59:43,300
Yeah, I mean cool yeah, it's yeah man, I mean cool I think yeah, it's pretty cool

729
00:59:43,900 --> 00:59:49,200
There's thousands of people incarcerated for fucking having having, you know

730
00:59:49,200 --> 00:59:56,060
A couple of leaves of marijuana in their pocket during a traffic stop and the wing stops over here like crunch them up, baby

731
00:59:56,420 --> 01:00:01,540
Roll them in the sweet green stuff, right? We know you're chronically hungry for these

732
01:00:02,460 --> 01:00:04,280
You get it. Yeah

733
01:00:04,280 --> 01:00:06,280
That's fair. Yum. Yum

734
01:00:06,780 --> 01:00:07,760
Cocoa

735
01:00:07,760 --> 01:00:14,140
Cocoa anyway, that's the story on 420. I will say though. It's like not a lot of

736
01:00:14,140 --> 01:00:18,660
There's not a lot of 420 this year there. I feel like it breathe

737
01:00:18,660 --> 01:00:24,440
I think it's because people are hitting the CBD so hard like that. That was a big thing for sure people putting a lot of

738
01:00:25,520 --> 01:00:32,000
CBD into their into their product also though a lot of places have now like legalized marijuana and it's hard to compete with the

739
01:00:34,380 --> 01:00:41,040
It's like if a like if McDonald's was like hey this ain't Patrick's Day come get our beer flavored burger

740
01:00:41,040 --> 01:00:45,780
No beer in it. There's no beer. I can't stress enough. You're fucked up not fun at all

741
01:00:47,660 --> 01:00:51,520
Thank you so much for listening to our podcast it's called my brother my brother me in case you've forgotten

742
01:00:51,700 --> 01:00:58,020
It's not called man versus B. That is our favorite TV show. Yeah, that one was taken that one was taken

743
01:00:59,180 --> 01:01:01,180
