1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:31,120
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:57,120
Ladies and gentlemen, Jurassic Park is back in IMAX and 3D, and to pay homage to the return

6
00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:02,560
of John Hammond's dream, we are broadcasting this special Max Fun Drive episode of My Brother,

7
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:15,520
My Brother, Me in IMAX and 3D and shit. What's a box? 40. No, what's a box? Tesseract.

8
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:22,480
Tesseract sound and... What's that? The sound folds the space between your ears.

9
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:29,680
D-box. We got D-box in it, and also lasers are in it.

10
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:37,200
So it's much like the Jurassic Park relaunch. It's the same fucking movie. So yeah, I guess,

11
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:42,640
yeah, $13 for a ticket for a movie I already saw. Okay. Yeah, that's cool. Did you change anything?

12
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:46,160
Did you change anything? It could also be a lot more laughable now whenever they talk about

13
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:51,520
hacking and her computer skills and the internet. Yeah. Yeah. What's that? No one knows.

14
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:59,040
Reading the fucking reviews of this 40-year-old movie that has been re-released. This is an

15
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:04,880
excerpt from Richard Corliss, Time Magazine's movie critic. The 3D process adds not just dimension,

16
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:09,040
but depth. A technological extension of cinematographer Greg Toland's deep focus

17
00:02:09,040 --> 00:02:13,600
innovations in The Grapes of Wrath and Citizen Kane. The change in perspective creates greater

18
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:19,920
intensity. Thanks, Dick. How's the fucking dinosaurs? How do they look? The depth in

19
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:25,040
the field of focus is unlike anything I've ever seen in the original Jurassic Park.

20
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:30,160
Just tell me about the fucking velociraptors. How sick are they? Are they still awesome?

21
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:34,880
Here's what would totally make me go see that movie. If they added a short scene at the beginning

22
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:41,920
with people digging in South America for the amber stuff, and they uncover a chunk of amber

23
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:47,760
with a movie reel in it, and they're like, ah, we can remake it. We can do this again.

24
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:53,120
Jurassic Park was impressive in 1993. 20 years later, it's flawless. Same fucking movie,

25
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:57,680
dog. I didn't see it in 1993 going, where's my crispness? I actually slept through it because

26
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:04,160
I was six. I was a sleepy bear. Yeah, you were so little. My joke that I have been leaning on

27
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:09,600
and really deploying a lot recently is, and I actually just got a chance to do this yesterday.

28
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:13,920
I was at the Tri-State Combo Convention, and someone told, I was there with Sydney,

29
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:20,560
and we ran into a friend of hers, a coworker actually. He said, yeah, we're going to finish

30
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:26,480
here, and then I'm going to go see Jurassic Park. And I said, oh man, you're just going to love it.

31
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:31,360
It's really tense, and there's dinosaurs and stuff. I don't know how you've missed it this long.

32
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:36,800
Spoiler alert. Life runs away. What's the joke? The joke is that everybody's already seen Jurassic

33
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:42,960
Park, so it's not like he's seeing it. He didn't laugh either. Are you the same person that when

34
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:46,000
Titanic came out, you're like, I hear the boat sinks at the end. Sorry, spoiler alert. Yeah,

35
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,120
exactly. I hear the boat sinks. You're a horrible person. You're one of those fucking dicks.

36
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:54,560
You're a horrible person. I'm not ruining the plot or anything. Hey, this is an advice show

37
00:03:54,560 --> 00:04:04,240
where we take your questions into wisdom. I want to start off with a question, and then we'll do

38
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:11,520
other questions, and then I will stop recording. Just see where it goes. We should mention the

39
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:16,160
second week of our Max Fun Drive two-week long spectacular. You're going to get a bonus length

40
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:21,280
app this week, and we're going to tell you all about how important Justin just ejaculated.

41
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:26,320
It is untenable to do this show for an hour, but I have to tell you guys, when you're staring down

42
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:33,040
the barrel of an hour and 15 minutes of goofs, it is simply, simply incomprehensible to me.

43
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:36,160
I don't know how I'm going to be funny that long. Well, it's going to be incomprehensible to our

44
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:42,320
listeners as well. We'll see if they kick it with us for an hour and 15. Just relax with us and kick

45
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:46,400
it. Here's our first question. Here's what we'll do. We'll just keep going until you all drop out.

46
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:51,600
We're going to keep the show going, and you just bail, whatever. Yeah. We're playing chicken with

47
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:55,760
you right now, dearly. No friction, zero friction. It's a free podcast. You don't have to, you know,

48
00:04:55,760 --> 00:05:00,800
you're not paying us. You should. You should be. Max Fun Drive 2013. Here's our first question.

49
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:06,240
My girlfriend and I recently got into a bit of a tiff over a TV spoiler. She just started watching

50
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:10,400
The X-Files, and I offhandedly mentioned that I heard it was no good after David Duchovny left.

51
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:15,600
What the fuck? I didn't know that either. I've only seen like four seasons of X-Files.

52
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:20,240
What the fuck? It was so bad when the Terminator showed up and started killing everyone.

53
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:28,480
Where does he go? David Duchovny? He went to do Californication. Yeah. Have fun solving

54
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:32,960
these alien mysteries. I'm going to go get my dick wet on the reg every day. I'm going to go

55
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:38,880
have sex with Susan, it's a random daughter. Is that real? Yeah. No, I think she plays his daughter

56
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:44,080
on the show. Or is that how it is? I don't know. I've never seen it. I hear it's pornographic.

57
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:51,200
You're guessing then. When they're cut up like that, can one of them even continue on the X-Files?

58
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:56,000
I don't think so. They're like, sorry, you're down to the J-Files now.

59
00:05:56,880 --> 00:06:02,240
I don't think you're ready for the X-Files anymore. When you had two of you, you were prepped. You

60
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:07,840
had the faculties. Now I'm going to bump you down to J, maybe R if you're good. So she got a bit

61
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:12,320
annoyed and considered it a spoiler, and he just considered it common knowledge about the program

62
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:16,400
and its history. I wouldn't think it's a spoiler to say that Steve Carell eventually leaves the

63
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:20,960
office or the doctor who eventually regenerates. They just seem like facts about the show.

64
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:25,360
Brothers, what constitutes a spoiler? And that's from Spoiled in South Slope.

65
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:32,080
This is interesting because I think it has to do with our modern age, with this modern era that

66
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:36,720
we're trying to fucking get people through every day, through this wasteland that we're leading the

67
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:43,120
underground railroad through, is the fucking, it's the internet. Like everything, it's the internet.

68
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:49,280
Because in 1990, 80, when this fucking X-Files show was on, there was no internet. So David,

69
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:52,400
the company left, you didn't know about it. The only reason, the only way you could watch it

70
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:57,360
is on TV or on VHS that your dad recorded. I remember when it was on in 1990, 80 too.

71
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,120
Yeah. For good years.

72
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:03,440
It's a super old show, is what I'm saying. Office, Steve Carell leaves the show,

73
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:07,280
and fucking people are on the street with it tattooed on their goddamn face.

74
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:10,480
They have a hyperlink to a Huffington Post article about Steve Carell leaving,

75
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:11,520
tattooed on their face. Everybody knows it.

76
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:17,280
This is also different though because in this, that has happened since, like okay,

77
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:22,160
I don't think you could have escaped the news of Steve Carell leaving the office. That happened

78
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:28,080
post internet age. David, the company leaving the X-Files though, that was a long time ago.

79
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:29,360
That was probably before the internet.

80
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:35,040
But Justin, to finish out your argument, that's like saying like, Darth is Luke's father. Oh,

81
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:37,200
what the shit? Spoiler alert, man.

82
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:39,600
That is a spoiler. I don't know why you'd do that.

83
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:42,400
I'm sorry. I didn't say his last name. It could be Darth anybody.

84
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:45,040
You could still spoil loss for people, is what I'm saying.

85
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:47,440
Could you?

86
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:53,200
I still think there's a, I still think that loss spoilers are like in effect, I feel like.

87
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:57,760
So let's, there's a hierarchy, right? Let's rank them. Number one, Breaking Bad. If you

88
00:07:57,760 --> 00:08:01,520
fucking say anything that has ever happened throughout the fullness of Breaking Bad,

89
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:03,360
you're a bag of dicks.

90
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:05,920
But I will say that the difference is that's still running.

91
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:07,440
It's not.

92
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:10,400
Right, that's what I'm saying. That's the, that's the, I'm establishing,

93
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:15,920
I'm establishing the worst thing you can do. And to me, that is Breaking Bad.

94
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:21,360
Even like Game of Thrones, there's books. So like people can read that shit if they want to know.

95
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:26,080
You know what I mean? Breaking Bad, number one. And then, I mean, it goes down the whole AMC

96
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:28,880
list, right? I've never watched Mad Men. If somebody told me shit about Mad Men,

97
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:30,960
I'd be upset because I'm going to get there one day.

98
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:34,080
You'll get there eventually. What do you, what is it that you're waiting for?

99
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:39,600
I'm waiting for them. I watch an episode and just the way they treat those women is just like.

100
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:40,560
It's too much for you.

101
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:44,880
It really is too much. I'm watching it like Beyonce, like, like, baby, I,

102
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:48,240
baby, I'm sorry that they, that things were like this back then.

103
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:52,080
And they still are like this in parts of the world. Third world, second world countries,

104
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:55,680
developing nations, California, Californication.

105
00:08:56,480 --> 00:09:00,880
Sometimes spending too long in a world without internet, even via television or

106
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:06,080
ironically, the internet makes you feel like fucking claustrophobic.

107
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:10,320
When I look at them and I realized that that is a phone on their desk and it is not anything

108
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:14,320
other than a phone on their desk. Like, and that's how they do their work. And if they need to,

109
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:19,520
I get a little, it's a little much for me. It's a little dour.

110
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:22,400
Yeah. That's what makes the amazing race so difficult.

111
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:27,680
Because there are these countries, you get exposed to what people are living like in other.

112
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:32,640
And some people are like, I saw people on that show dancing and it didn't seem to be for like

113
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:35,600
money or anything. They just seem to be dancing to pass the time.

114
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:40,480
Yeah. Well, that's, well, I mean, it's also the most beautiful thing.

115
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:45,280
It's the most beautiful thing in the world that people are just dancing

116
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:49,040
for the, for the feel of it. You know what I mean?

117
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:49,840
Not for tips or anything?

118
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:54,400
No, no. Well, actually in this, in this scenario.

119
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:57,600
In this particular challenge, they had to get $10 in tips before they could bounce, but.

120
00:09:58,320 --> 00:09:59,120
Okay. Okay.

121
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:01,600
A hundred rand if memory serves.

122
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:04,960
I would, I would say that the funny thing of this question is the opposite side of

123
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:09,520
this question is when you start watching the show after it's already been on like 10 years.

124
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:12,880
She can't roll up to her friends and be like, oh my God, you guys,

125
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:16,400
I just found this new show is called X-Files. You should all check it out.

126
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:23,280
But like, okay. I think there's a converse relation to the statute of limitations ending

127
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:28,720
and the value of like talking about it.

128
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:34,400
I think it's just, just be fucking polite. Like, have you watched X-Files?

129
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:40,560
Yes. Man, when, when, when Chovny leaves, it really takes a nosedive. Yeah, I know.

130
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:44,720
I was there when that happened so I can talk to you about it. Hey, have you seen X-Files?

131
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:46,800
No, I haven't. Well, then I'm not going to tell you about this.

132
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:52,080
Hey, and Guy, can I just like double underline that what you said about it,

133
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:57,360
she said she's enjoying this new program. And for you to come along and be like, oh,

134
00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:02,160
oh, enjoy it while it lasts. Cause I hear it gets shitty. It drives me fucking crazy when

135
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:08,640
people do that. They'll try to do any discussion of the West wing. It is always like, just make

136
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:12,960
sure you stop watching before after season five. Well, fuck those people because six and seven

137
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:19,840
gets good. But the thing is about West Wing, and I'm sure other shows are like this too,

138
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:24,400
is it takes persistence. I fucked up my first time watching West Wing. I watched that

139
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:31,280
fucking episode in season five. Oh, that fucking episode where he's like, shut it down. And then

140
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:35,920
I did shut down my Xbox and I stopped watching the goddamn television program because it was so bad.

141
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:41,440
No, I mean, and it gets crazy. And John Goodman's president for a while. It gets fucking nuts.

142
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:47,440
But we just spoiled, you just fucking spoiled something, Justin. Justin? What? You just fucking,

143
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:50,800
somebody's listening right now that's on season four and a half of West Wing. Like,

144
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:54,320
can't wait to experience this in my own, in real time. And you just fucking looped on.

145
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:58,320
It's going to be such a heightened, no, it is, I have heightened the experience

146
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:02,240
because if you're watching West Wing and constantly wondering, is this when John

147
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:06,960
Goodman becomes president? Can I see? Is he bit by John Goodman and at the full moon,

148
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:09,600
he transforms into- He becomes Goodman.

149
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:16,480
That's not outside the realm of- Your hand looked like a shoulder stake. I'm sorry,

150
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:21,840
I don't know what to tell you. I just read a great Onion article where it was about a friend

151
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:28,320
one season ahead and TV show of another friend gives him mystic wisdom about upcoming events.

152
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:32,960
And that's what, and that's, let's not lie. Like that's exactly when we talk about how six and

153
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:37,040
seven gets so much better and you guys, oh, you got to stick with it. It's because we're so fucking

154
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:42,320
cultured and experienced and- Oh, when someone says like, oh, have you made it to season three yet?

155
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:48,080
Ah, just wait for season three. They're not doing that to help you. They're not your friends.

156
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:53,200
Sometimes though they're helping. Like when they say that, make sure you stick around for season

157
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:57,920
2.5 of Battlestar. You might not know that there is a 2.5, you might skip it, go straight to three

158
00:12:57,920 --> 00:13:02,480
and then you're like, where's Starbuck? A lot of shows are hard to watch.

159
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:07,760
Battlestar Galacta is hard to like watch right. Like you can mess it up very easily.

160
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:12,800
You got to go 3.2 up to 4.1 and then you got to drop back down to 3.8 for the webisodes.

161
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:19,280
A lot of important canonical extensions in those webisodes. So don't miss it. You got to watch

162
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:26,000
Razor, Razor, Razor 2, drop back to Caprica, hop back on for Heart of the Swarm and then drop

163
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:33,360
back down. You got to watch Razor, but backwards. So, Spoilers on a Slope, in short, you were the

164
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:37,040
jerk this time. Because it was really silly of you to tell her it gets bad. Like what,

165
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:41,280
why would you even say that? Unless you were warning her that it gets better,

166
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:44,640
which I don't think it does. Sorry, X-Files. You guys want a Yahoo?

167
00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:48,880
Yeah, yeah I do. This Yahoo was sent in by two different people,

168
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:52,720
one of whom was Jacob Blocker, one of whom was Jack Howard. I don't know how it happened.

169
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:57,040
It's a mystical occurrence. Are they working together?

170
00:13:57,040 --> 00:14:00,480
I think that they fucking work together, except they were sent like days apart. So they probably

171
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:04,640
found it together and then Jack was like, yeah, let's wait until Tuesday to send this in. And then

172
00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:10,800
he fucking got the jump on it on Saturday. Anyway, thank you both. It's by Yahoo Institute user

173
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:25,280
Manuel who asks, is it okay to eat in the bathroom at McDonald's? Hi. Hello. How are you? Whenever I

174
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:29,120
go to McDonald's, I always eat in the bathroom. I've been doing this for five years now without

175
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:36,720
a problem. I think that saying without a problem is very generous.

176
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:42,560
Well, yeah, let's break that term down. Like the fucking McDonald's bouncer's not going to kick the

177
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:46,960
door and be like, I've been following your trail for five years. It goes straight from the fucking

178
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:50,000
cash register to the bathroom. So it was not a very difficult trail to follow.

179
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,960
You got to think though, that if he's been going to the same McDonald's,

180
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:58,400
that the cashiers are starting to talk. Oh, I hope he's not going to- I hope nobody's

181
00:14:58,400 --> 00:15:02,240
going to the same McDonald's. Except for that dude in Supersize Me.

182
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:04,480
Oh, new guy, don't worry. That's just bathroom Steve.

183
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:09,360
That dude in Supersize Me, who's like, I ate 5,000 Big Macs. I eat six a day. And it's like,

184
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:14,480
that's great. But like, can you do them at different McDonald's's? So they're not like,

185
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:16,960
oh, here comes Big Mac Mac. Cause his name's Mac.

186
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:18,720
His name is also Mac.

187
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:19,920
His name is also Mac.

188
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:20,720
Can you-

189
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:23,040
And it's like, why wouldn't you just call him Big Mac? If that's the case.

190
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:24,320
Can you imagine-

191
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:27,600
Well, cause he was actually very thin, if I remember correctly. He was a thin man.

192
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:28,320
He was fucking disgusting.

193
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:33,040
Can you imagine you're on a road trip, you park a car, you park a car,

194
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:37,840
you park, you pull into a McDonald's, you run, you make a rush for the bathroom,

195
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:41,040
promising yourself that you'll go back and buy a Hi-C or something.

196
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:46,960
You go to the bathroom, you open the stall door, and there's just this guy,

197
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:50,240
hunched over, jamming chicken strips into his-

198
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:54,800
Occupied, occupied, occupied with flavor.

199
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:57,760
Is he voiding though, while he eats, is the question.

200
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:00,080
I should hope not.

201
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:04,320
Is this, have we ever told the corncob story?

202
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:06,080
I feel like we have to have told the corncob story,

203
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:07,840
cause it's the best thing that's ever happened.

204
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:09,600
No, to my knowledge, we have not.

205
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:13,360
The perfect diagram of efficiency that is the corncob story.

206
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:17,440
The corncob story is, we were at a trailer, trailer park?

207
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:17,840
No.

208
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:19,120
It was a trailer park campground.

209
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:20,960
It was a trailer park campground, which is like,

210
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:23,280
I don't care how fucking temporary your stay is,

211
00:16:23,280 --> 00:16:26,560
you're living in a trailer park for the period that you were there.

212
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:31,360
We were staying there with our cousins or uncles or, I think it was Tim and Tom, right?

213
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:35,360
And so we were staying there, and we were walking the grounds,

214
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:39,680
seeing the sights, checking out, scoping some whinnies.

215
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:46,240
And we went to the bathroom, and it was one of those deplorable kinds of bathrooms,

216
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:48,000
with no doors on the stalls.

217
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:49,760
So like, those technically aren't even-

218
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:50,720
Which are not bathrooms.

219
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:52,400
In my opinion, they're not bathrooms.

220
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:53,360
They're not bathrooms.

221
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:57,280
They're fucking temporary concentration camps that you can walk out of.

222
00:16:57,280 --> 00:17:00,000
They're risky water fountains, as far as I'm concerned.

223
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,040
There's nothing-

224
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:02,720
They're little public jails.

225
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:07,440
And we walked in, and I was walking, you know,

226
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:10,800
just checking to see if maybe one of these fucking stalls had a door on it,

227
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:14,800
because it's 1999, and we're living in a civilized goddamn world.

228
00:17:15,840 --> 00:17:17,920
And kind of, I mean, we were in a trailer park.

229
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:25,520
And walked by one stall, and I didn't look long,

230
00:17:26,080 --> 00:17:27,440
because it's like, I guess, a crime.

231
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:31,680
But there was a little kid, I would say half chubby.

232
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:33,680
I mean, he was half fat.

233
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:38,160
Not either party in this scenario was half chubby.

234
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:41,040
He was this half fat kid, and he was sitting there taking a poop.

235
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:47,920
And while he was taking a poop, he was also eating some corn on the cob.

236
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:50,400
He was eating his corn on the cob while voiding.

237
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:54,960
And I walked out and made a hand gesture to-

238
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:56,000
I forget who was with me.

239
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,720
I made a hand gesture, like a fucking SWAT team.

240
00:17:58,720 --> 00:17:59,680
Like, I can't talk.

241
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:00,080
I can't-

242
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:02,480
I'm about to lose my fucking mind laughing.

243
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:06,320
You need to go walk eight feet in that direction and look westward.

244
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:08,640
Turn your eyes westward towards-

245
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:11,600
Corncob boy.

246
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:11,840
Corncob boy.

247
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:12,960
And then we'll talk-

248
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:13,520
We will-

249
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:18,560
I did a little loop with my finger to say we will do some recon later on this.

250
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:21,680
We will get together and discuss it in a group.

251
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:23,600
Not now, though.

252
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:25,200
For now, we are completely-

253
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:25,600
Not now.

254
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:26,800
I need your total silence.

255
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:28,480
We're deep within enemy territory.

256
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:29,440
I need you to walk there.

257
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:31,520
I need it to be very clear that I did not say,

258
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:33,600
hey, go check out this kid with no pants on.

259
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:36,320
You have to keep it totally cash.

260
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:37,280
You got to keep it cash.

261
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:37,920
Cash.

262
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:38,320
Turn.

263
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:38,560
Say-

264
00:18:38,560 --> 00:18:40,000
Oh, excuse me.

265
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,560
Say, like, excuse me, or how's that corn?

266
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:47,520
Pretty good, I bet, since you couldn't fucking tear yourself away from it.

267
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:50,560
Couldn't leave it on the pic-a-nic table.

268
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:52,400
Go void.

269
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:55,280
Go evacuate, and then return to your biz.

270
00:18:56,480 --> 00:19:00,240
There was a moment in this kid's life where he was eating corn,

271
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:01,920
realized he needed to use the bathroom with the-

272
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:03,760
Well, I can't leave this here.

273
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:04,400
I get it.

274
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:05,360
I mean, he buttered it.

275
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:07,680
And once you butter it, it's like, that's your day.

276
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:08,080
Yeah.

277
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:10,160
That's your day until it's done.

278
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:10,800
That's your day.

279
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:13,840
Have you ever thought about it from this kid's point of view,

280
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:17,120
that maybe, like, Griffin's acknowledgement of him

281
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:20,560
and, like, just the look on Griffin's face changed this kid's life?

282
00:19:20,560 --> 00:19:21,360
Turned his life around.

283
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:22,800
That kid grew up Steve Jobs.

284
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:23,760
He grew up super fast.

285
00:19:24,560 --> 00:19:25,760
He grew up Steve Jobs.

286
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,960
Anyway, maybe that's what this kid-

287
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:32,400
Maybe that's who's asking this question.

288
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:33,760
It's fine, right?

289
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:35,600
Um, it's not okay.

290
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:36,160
I mean, I get it.

291
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:38,960
Like, I hate, hate, hate, hate, hate.

292
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:40,000
It's not just McDonald's.

293
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:44,000
It's anything going inside of a fast food restaurant when I-

294
00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:45,520
You know what I mean?

295
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:48,240
Like, unless I am on a road trip and I'm going to use the bathroom,

296
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:50,960
I'm never like, hey, you guys want to get out and eat inside?

297
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:52,560
Like, the answer to that question is always no.

298
00:19:52,560 --> 00:19:52,880
No.

299
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:54,320
I can't even imagine-

300
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:58,960
I don't understand why most fast food restaurants have dining rooms.

301
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:00,080
Like, I really-

302
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:02,880
I think it's- It's also, I think, for kids' parties in the 90s.

303
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:05,040
I think it's one of those vestig-

304
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:05,680
Yes.

305
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:09,040
It's one of those like crazy vestigial things of-

306
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:13,360
There was a simpler time in the 1950s where you would go

307
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:15,920
and Speedy would bring you out a tasty burger,

308
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:17,440
bring it right out to you,

309
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:19,440
and you'd sit there with your family after church,

310
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:22,480
and it would smell so clean.

311
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:24,480
And now, like, that's not-

312
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:27,280
Every McDonald's, it's been around for longer than six months.

313
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:30,320
It's like caked in funk, and you have to-

314
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:32,480
That's not fair or accurate.

315
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:34,080
McDonald's are pristine.

316
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:36,800
Many McDonald's are pristine.

317
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:39,120
Some McDonald's are clean.

318
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:39,760
Okay.

319
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:40,240
Okay.

320
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:40,880
You're right.

321
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:42,880
When was the last time you were inside a steak and shake?

322
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:45,840
I don't think I've been here.

323
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:46,640
They don't have those here.

324
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:47,920
Well, because it is that.

325
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:49,760
Like, it's an actual, like, restaurant inside,

326
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:52,880
and like that full-on you walk into a time warp and you're in the 50s.

327
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:53,200
Yeah.

328
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:54,800
And like, there's families everywhere.

329
00:20:54,800 --> 00:20:57,920
It's crazy. Sorry, tangent, but it blows my mind.

330
00:20:57,920 --> 00:20:59,600
So if you want to see some families,

331
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:01,600
cruise on down to the steak and shake,

332
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:04,800
and you can scope all the families, all the families you like.

333
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:06,640
I just go down there and family watch, you know what I mean?

334
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:11,040
And if you want to see a half-fat kid eating corn on the cob,

335
00:21:11,040 --> 00:21:12,080
if you want to see-

336
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:13,680
I know what you're talking about, though,

337
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:16,880
because you don't see that in adults, really,

338
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:19,360
but like, you would see that in little kids a lot,

339
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:21,680
mainly because, I guess, little kids have to have their show.

340
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:24,960
Yeah, but like, you would see kids who are like skinny

341
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:27,920
to about like three inches above their belly button,

342
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:28,880
and then they're fat below there.

343
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:30,240
And then it got around, yeah.

344
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:31,600
It's like bingo from the biggest-

345
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:35,760
this latest season, the biggest loser, except like after, after he-

346
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:37,840
and like, I don't want to fucking put bingo on blast,

347
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:39,440
and I don't want to salt his game or anything like that,

348
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:40,800
because he worked really hard.

349
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:42,080
He had a broken ankle for a long time,

350
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:43,920
and he still managed to drop like 70 pounds,

351
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:46,480
which for a 10-year-old kid is like everything,

352
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:48,160
but he was still a little weak.

353
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:49,440
Yeah, he was a little weak.

354
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:52,880
Everything, but he was still a little, little, you know what I mean?

355
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:54,160
They're mean to him on that show.

356
00:21:54,160 --> 00:21:55,200
Did you read about-

357
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:57,440
Oh man, it is a brutal environment.

358
00:21:57,440 --> 00:22:00,080
Yeah, well, yeah, because you had fucking Jillian Michaels like,

359
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:04,240
if you don't eat this okra, you're gonna eat my shit!

360
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:06,320
And then she put shit down Bingo's throat.

361
00:22:07,040 --> 00:22:10,240
Hey, speaking of eating stuff, I can't eat eggs.

362
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:12,800
Not because of allergenic reasons.

363
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:15,040
Ever since I was a toddler,

364
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:17,200
I just couldn't bring myself to eat them.

365
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:20,720
Scrambled, poached, boiled, even mixed with fried rice.

366
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:21,360
You name it.

367
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:22,800
Over the years, I've tried it.

368
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:24,080
Can't even chew them.

369
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:24,960
Really want to like them.

370
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,760
Not only for the protein content,

371
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:30,400
but my GF apparently makes devastating scrambled eggs

372
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:31,440
that I would love to try.

373
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:36,240
Oh, brothers, what can I do to change my senses and love eggs?

374
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:37,120
That's from eggs.

375
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:41,760
Eggervated in Egan.

376
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:43,600
I have a hard time not picturing him

377
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:44,800
putting eggs in his mouth and going,

378
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:45,680
it's not working!

379
00:22:45,680 --> 00:22:47,200
I can't do it!

380
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:50,640
How do you move your teeth around these things?

381
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:52,400
How does anyone eat eggs?

382
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:54,640
This reminds me of Bingo from Biggest Loser

383
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:55,760
trying to eat vegetables.

384
00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:56,400
Can't do it.

385
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:57,440
You can lead a horse to water,

386
00:22:57,440 --> 00:22:58,960
but you can't make Bingo eat vegetables.

387
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:00,320
That's what Bingo's dad always says.

388
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:05,760
I don't understand the question.

389
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:07,440
You don't like them, you mean?

390
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:10,560
Because it's okay not to like some food.

391
00:23:10,560 --> 00:23:12,720
Can I say, listen, I get it.

392
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:15,360
Because this is how I feel about mayonnaise.

393
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:18,720
But I have no reason.

394
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:20,160
I have no justification.

395
00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:21,600
There is no background to it.

396
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:22,720
I just don't want to eat it.

397
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:24,720
That's crazy that you don't like mayonnaise, first of all.

398
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:25,440
I get it.

399
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:27,200
Do you know what mayonnaise is, Travis, right now?

400
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:29,440
Can you tell me right now what mayonnaise is?

401
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:31,840
It's basically just like solid fat.

402
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:32,160
No.

403
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:32,880
It's oil.

404
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:33,840
No, you're wrong.

405
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:36,400
It's an egg and it's oil and that's all that it is.

406
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:39,280
I know for a fucking fact you love both of those things.

407
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:41,600
You will fry an egg in oil and you'll eat that.

408
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:42,240
That's mayonnaise.

409
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:45,360
Better men than you have tried to dissect my problem with mayonnaise.

410
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:46,880
No, mayonnaise is gross.

411
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:48,400
You don't want to know the messed up thing?

412
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:48,720
What?

413
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:52,240
If it's like on something and I'm unaware of it, I have no problem with it.

414
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:52,640
Oh, sure.

415
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:54,480
But if someone says like, do you want mayonnaise on it?

416
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:55,120
I'm like, oh, no.

417
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:59,600
But that's mayonnaise's only job is to fucking ghost it on a sandwich to make it a little wetter.

418
00:23:59,600 --> 00:23:59,840
That's it.

419
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:00,960
This is my problem, though.

420
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:03,440
But like, here's the thing with all condiments.

421
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:06,880
And I stayed away from condiments for a good part of my life.

422
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:08,560
Because it feels better to just be natural.

423
00:24:08,560 --> 00:24:09,760
Because I just want a raw dog.

424
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:12,400
Just want a raw sandwich.

425
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:17,840
No, I stayed away from it because people would, restaurants especially, will always over apply.

426
00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:23,680
A little thin layer of mayo can be appealing.

427
00:24:23,680 --> 00:24:25,760
But you don't ever get that anywhere.

428
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:28,160
It's like, that's how much mayo you get.

429
00:24:29,920 --> 00:24:31,200
You get how much of mayo.

430
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:33,280
How much mayo would you like a, or would you like?

431
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:35,520
That's what you get.

432
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:40,880
I always, if I bite a sandwich and mayonnaise gooshes out of it,

433
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:43,600
my dining experience has come to an abrupt halt.

434
00:24:44,560 --> 00:24:46,320
That's the end of my dining experience.

435
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:49,120
You bite it and then like a solid jet of it shoots out.

436
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:51,440
And it gets on your grandma.

437
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:54,000
And then that's Nutty Professor 3.

438
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:55,520
You're welcome.

439
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:56,880
You're welcome, Nutty Professor 3.

440
00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:57,840
Enjoy the clumps.

441
00:24:57,840 --> 00:25:01,200
So I'm betting that this guy's problem is like purely mental.

442
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:02,720
That it's just like, oh, eggs?

443
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:03,280
No.

444
00:25:03,280 --> 00:25:04,720
Eggs is a big fucking.

445
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:06,240
That's a huge.

446
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:07,920
I don't, I couldn't make it without eggs.

447
00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:08,480
Couldn't make it.

448
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:09,840
How do you eat breakfast tacos?

449
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:12,080
I ate eggs inside my breakfast tacos yesterday.

450
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:15,200
I'd say like, it's a four times a week thing for me.

451
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:20,080
You can't see the thing though where it's like, oh, that's like a chicken baby.

452
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:20,800
Oh, it's not that.

453
00:25:20,800 --> 00:25:21,440
I don't think it's that.

454
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:24,400
It doesn't seem to be conceptually bothering this person.

455
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:28,400
I think maybe you should just start trying different styles.

456
00:25:29,040 --> 00:25:33,680
Like you need to find a handhold in the world of eggs.

457
00:25:33,680 --> 00:25:36,240
And then like build from there.

458
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:39,120
Eggs are a protein and they are a vehicle for other flavors.

459
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:42,080
And that vehicle can be delivered in so many different ways.

460
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:43,760
That's what's craziest to me.

461
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:47,680
Is you can fucking disguise it in so many.

462
00:25:47,680 --> 00:25:51,120
I put a little Fox Point seasoning in it and a little salt and a little pepper.

463
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:51,600
And that's it.

464
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:53,200
And it doesn't taste anything like eggs.

465
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:55,040
Tastes like fucking Fox Point seasoning.

466
00:25:55,040 --> 00:25:56,720
What's Fox Point seasoning?

467
00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:58,640
It's a, you know, it's a special, I don't know.

468
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:03,520
It just came with the, it came with the seasoning set that Rachel got me for my birthday.

469
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:04,320
A couple of years ago.

470
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:07,120
And it's fucking delicious.

471
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:10,800
Hey, here's some free, speaking of spices, here's some free advice to everybody.

472
00:26:10,800 --> 00:26:11,200
Yeah.

473
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:15,120
If it's been a few years since you've used a spice, check the expiration date on it.

474
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:16,240
Oh, Fox Point doesn't go bad.

475
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:20,720
It won't ever hurt you, but you will really lose a lot of potency.

476
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:24,400
I bought some new crushed red pepper flakes and I stopped using the jar I've been using

477
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:25,040
for five years.

478
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:29,760
I bought some new crushed red pepper flakes and it was honestly, it was like being able

479
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:32,480
to taste again after being in some sort of heat loop.

480
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:36,000
See, I just go to, I just go to Pizza Hut during, when they have their lunch buffet

481
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,800
and I just scoop up the red pepper flakes, just throw them in my pocket.

482
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:39,840
Fill your pockets full.

483
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:42,320
Fill my pockets, just put, you know, pepper flakes and Parmesan.

484
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:45,200
I do the same thing with the carrot shreddings.

485
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:47,520
Those are delicious.

486
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:54,480
My jam with eggs right now, and this is really delicious, is I make an omelet and I cook

487
00:26:54,480 --> 00:27:01,600
some apple slices in brandy and cinnamon and then put the apple slices into the omelet.

488
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:05,760
I learned that from the Frugal Gourmet, who it turns out is a child molester guy, sort

489
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:06,320
of.

490
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:07,280
Oh no!

491
00:27:07,280 --> 00:27:08,160
I know, right?

492
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:09,360
I was so bummed.

493
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:15,520
That story just went from my extreme fascination of cinnamon apples and eggs.

494
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:16,560
Why haven't, aw man.

495
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:23,680
But no, guys, seriously, he taught me how to make the best omelets and I don't, you know,

496
00:27:23,680 --> 00:27:25,440
he can have a kid or two as far as I'm concerned.

497
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:27,440
That's not, oh no, Justin, no!

498
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:28,720
I don't mean it like that.

499
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:31,440
We don't need to lay a sacrifice at the feet of the Frugal Gourmet.

500
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:33,760
I'm not gonna sit here and pass judgment on Frugal Gourmet.

501
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:37,200
Okay, Justin, what if that kid was corncob boy?

502
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:38,240
Now don't you feel bad.

503
00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:40,000
Isn't there egg on your face?

504
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:42,560
Just eat these fucking eggs.

505
00:27:42,560 --> 00:27:45,760
You can, oh my god, there's eggs in everything you eat.

506
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:49,280
I have a second suggestion that might help.

507
00:27:49,280 --> 00:27:49,760
What's that?

508
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:55,920
I mean, it's how you train dogs, but have a little bit egg along with your favorite

509
00:27:55,920 --> 00:28:00,640
kind of food and just pair them together until eventually you're gonna create a new

510
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:04,720
connection that eggs are good and they remind you of your favorite food.

511
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:08,000
Put a little bit of egg on the tip of your nose and then when I ring this bell,

512
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:09,760
I want you to jump up and grab it.

513
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:11,680
You laugh, but that'd be a really impressive trick.

514
00:28:11,680 --> 00:28:13,760
It would be because eggs are super floppy.

515
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:20,160
I made the mistake this week of, I thought the Onion AV Club, when they did podcast reviews,

516
00:28:20,160 --> 00:28:25,680
they only like did them about episodes that were good and a few weeks ago,

517
00:28:25,680 --> 00:28:31,600
we, I guess we put up a rock as they say in the e-ball world and they said like,

518
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:34,880
they called us on and they said, wow, they really threw an air ball this time.

519
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:35,920
Real clunker.

520
00:28:35,920 --> 00:28:42,320
And now like anytime we're recording, the only voice I can hear is the voice of the AV Club.

521
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:47,280
So they're like, there is a prolonged 20 minute discussion of egg preparation.

522
00:28:47,280 --> 00:28:50,560
I do not recommend to anyone.

523
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:55,600
Right, but then you go fucking switch over to egg blog podcast reviews and they're like,

524
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:58,720
A plus, best ep ever.

525
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:00,080
Go see it, five stars.

526
00:29:01,040 --> 00:29:02,000
Drop some money on them.

527
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:09,600
Finally, the McElroy's break their three year long egg silence and fucking get on.

528
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:14,160
Actually it is three years on the 30th, right?

529
00:29:14,160 --> 00:29:17,200
Wednesday, the 10th, April 10th was our first time.

530
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:21,680
Jesus Christ, I can't fucking believe how long you've been doing this stupid goddamn show.

531
00:29:21,680 --> 00:29:24,320
Hey, if you want us to keep doing this goddamn show,

532
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:26,400
you're going to have to get up in the Max Fund Drive.

533
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:35,920
It is our annual fundraiser to help collect money for the maximum fun podcast network,

534
00:29:35,920 --> 00:29:39,040
of which we are a proud, proud member.

535
00:29:39,040 --> 00:29:40,480
This is our third Max Fund Drive.

536
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:44,400
I'm sure that most of you know the score, especially if you listened last week.

537
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:51,360
If you don't, we are raising money for Max Fund Drive, for the maximum fund network.

538
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:57,520
We get paid, I think it's safe to say, I know you guys are uncomfortable talking about finances.

539
00:29:57,520 --> 00:29:58,880
We make bank!

540
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:03,920
We make bank, we get that sticky green, is that weed or money?

541
00:30:03,920 --> 00:30:04,480
It's both.

542
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:08,880
We get the money and we spend it on weed and that money comes from you.

543
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:12,240
We're a donor supported network, which is amazing.

544
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:18,720
Jesse Thorn wrote up a big essay about why it is a donor supported network and it's moving.

545
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:20,560
So go look that up and find it.

546
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:26,640
But yeah, we have, we collect monthly donations at a number of different levels.

547
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:30,800
There's something for whatever price point you can work with.

548
00:30:30,800 --> 00:30:35,520
We have a $10 donation level, $20, $35, all the way up to $200.

549
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:43,200
For doing that, you not only support us and help grow the show and help bring new shows to the Max

550
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:49,520
Fund Network, which this past year we've seen crazy expansion with RISK and the Memory Palace

551
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:56,640
and Wham Bam Pow and what up, God, One Bad Mother just opened up, Dave Hill's podcasting incident.

552
00:30:56,640 --> 00:31:04,720
It's like we've doubled the network this year and every show is just delightful.

553
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:10,000
There's really no collection of media anywhere else on internet or otherwise.

554
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:13,120
But anyway, you help support us. You also get some pretty dope gifts.

555
00:31:13,680 --> 00:31:15,520
Justin, you want to break some of those down for us?

556
00:31:15,520 --> 00:31:19,520
So if you give us $10 a month, that is super generous of you.

557
00:31:19,520 --> 00:31:25,520
And to say thank you, we are going to send you some very cool Maximum Fun earbuds.

558
00:31:25,520 --> 00:31:29,920
They are branded with our distinctive Rocketship logo and they are fresh to death.

559
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:34,400
You're also going to get a ton of, how many hours?

560
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:36,960
We figured it up, like it was like 30 something.

561
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:40,800
Like 30 some hours of donor exclusive material.

562
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:42,880
Yeah, every year we do a bonus episode.

563
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:44,480
So does every other podcast.

564
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:48,720
So based on how many years they've been, like this is our third year, we have three bonus episodes.

565
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:53,440
Plus the episode that we did for Max Fund Day in October.

566
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:54,720
Oh shit, that's right.

567
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:58,640
Yeah, and one of those episodes contains Papa McElroy.

568
00:31:58,640 --> 00:31:59,200
Our daddy.

569
00:31:59,200 --> 00:31:59,840
It's hilarious.

570
00:31:59,840 --> 00:32:03,520
So if you have been wanting to hear from whence we came,

571
00:32:03,520 --> 00:32:09,840
And if you're a previous donor, like the physical gifts are for people who are new donors or people who upgrade.

572
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:12,960
You can find all this information on MaximumFun.org forward slash donate by the way.

573
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:17,360
But if you're a previous donor, you get all that bonus shit, like regardless.

574
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:20,480
For $20 a month, we're going to give you the Intimate Sensations pack.

575
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:26,320
That is definitely, definitely, definitely a box of sex stuff.

576
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:27,360
There's a black sexy mask.

577
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:29,600
For our freaky listeners, you know you love it.

578
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:40,960
The Velvafil Massager, Rocket Lube, which is Maximum Fun Sex Lube, which I would not, I would not recommend opening for collector's value.

579
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:42,080
You're going to want to sell that.

580
00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:45,200
Well, but good luck existing it when you're trying to fuck a dry butt.

581
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:48,400
And then you look over and you're like, I got the solution right here.

582
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:50,800
I have the ungent that I need to perform this.

583
00:32:50,800 --> 00:32:52,800
And to be...

584
00:32:52,800 --> 00:32:55,120
Or a dry vagina or a dry vagina.

585
00:32:55,120 --> 00:32:55,840
Sorry, go ahead.

586
00:32:55,840 --> 00:32:59,840
Travis, I just to make it clear, that's from our friends, the Extreme Restraints.

587
00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:10,080
Like not only our biggest supporters, but we didn't just take a Gatorade bottle and just put some, put like a mixture of olive oil and bathwater into it.

588
00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:11,200
Like it's legit.

589
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:12,160
It's legit lube.

590
00:33:12,160 --> 00:33:15,360
It's going to help you fuck a butt or a vagina.

591
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:23,040
At $35, you're going to get all that stuff plus a pair of rocket engraved rocks glasses, which I would not recommend.

592
00:33:23,040 --> 00:33:28,240
These are, these are some sharp glasses.

593
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:28,880
Well, they're not sharp.

594
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:31,200
You're not going to like cut your mouth to the touch.

595
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:31,680
They're smooth.

596
00:33:31,680 --> 00:33:33,520
They've got a thick, heavy bottom.

597
00:33:33,520 --> 00:33:36,400
You can pour just like spirits in it.

598
00:33:36,400 --> 00:33:38,320
Just like Travis got a thick ass.

599
00:33:40,160 --> 00:33:43,520
You pour, you pour your spirits in this and you have a good time with friends.

600
00:33:43,520 --> 00:33:44,240
There's two of them.

601
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:46,080
So you can have maybe an intimate date.

602
00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:50,880
Maybe you fill it with rocket lube and then you pour the rocket lube from the glass into a dry butt.

603
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:59,840
Maybe you pour it into your own butt because like, maybe you're at like a festival and it's like, it's really dry down there or it gets really swampy.

604
00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:01,440
We'll pour a little lube in there.

605
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:02,400
It'll fix you right up.

606
00:34:02,400 --> 00:34:04,160
Maybe your window is a little...

607
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:08,000
Also, if you, if you massage the lube into a bald man's head, his hair will grow back.

608
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,240
His hair will grow back because you got streaks on your windows.

609
00:34:10,240 --> 00:34:14,160
Just throw some lube on it and then wipe it down and then shove it in your ass.

610
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:16,320
The window?

611
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:21,040
The whole window, the whole fixture right in there.

612
00:34:21,040 --> 00:34:21,760
You know what they say?

613
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:27,440
A man's way to his heart is the window to the soul, which is his asshole with an actual window in it.

614
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:31,920
So I guess, so do that.

615
00:34:32,720 --> 00:34:36,400
It's maximumfun.org forward slash donate.

616
00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:39,280
Please do this right now while you're thinking about it.

617
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:40,400
You'll forget later.

618
00:34:40,400 --> 00:34:42,160
Go do it right this second.

619
00:34:42,160 --> 00:34:45,760
We can, we will be here waiting for you when you get back.

620
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:49,840
Or if you have a computer handy, just go ahead and do it.

621
00:34:49,840 --> 00:34:53,520
We are, we are almost halfway.

622
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:56,640
We have a goal of a thousand new donors, which is the goal we have every year.

623
00:34:56,640 --> 00:35:00,160
We don't have a thermoboner this year to track it, which is horseshit.

624
00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:03,200
Typically Jesse Thorn draws up a thermometer to keep track of it,

625
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:07,600
but because he's got a boner addled mind, it always ends up looking like a boner.

626
00:35:07,600 --> 00:35:08,880
Not this year, not this year.

627
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:11,520
We got some sort of HTML5 thing, which is...

628
00:35:12,080 --> 00:35:12,800
It's horseshit.

629
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:13,440
It's horseshit.

630
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:18,400
But we're on track, we still need everybody's help to get there.

631
00:35:19,120 --> 00:35:21,520
And we also have challenge donors who, every time we get a new donor,

632
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:23,200
they donate a certain amount of money, which is...

633
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:24,880
Does anybody know where it's at?

634
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:27,040
It was over six bucks last time, which is...

635
00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:29,840
If we hit the goal of a thousand donors, it's like a lot of money.

636
00:35:29,840 --> 00:35:32,000
Oh God, please gimme.

637
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:35,680
And I also want to say, lest we forget, lest we forget,

638
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:39,840
if you are a Max Fund donor from the past, we are so grateful for you.

639
00:35:39,840 --> 00:35:43,520
I know that sometimes we hit the new Max Fund drive and it seems like

640
00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:46,480
we're so excited about new donors and we're trying to get new people.

641
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:53,120
But if you've been a donor with us for a while, you are what makes this station happen.

642
00:35:53,120 --> 00:35:55,280
Somebody pointed out to me on Twitter, they were like,

643
00:35:56,560 --> 00:35:58,160
I'm uncomfortable with doing a monthly donation

644
00:35:58,160 --> 00:36:02,960
because it's the same amount of Netflix or other services like that.

645
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:06,960
And the fact that there are people out there that feel like

646
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:08,800
they get the same amount of entertainment from us

647
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:10,000
and the other shows on the Max Fund Network

648
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:13,600
that they do from quote unquote professional services like that

649
00:36:13,600 --> 00:36:17,440
and are willing to support us with the same amount of money,

650
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:18,960
that's fucking amazing to me.

651
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:22,960
And I'm not saying that they are mistaken in saying that

652
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:26,160
because I get literally a dozen hours of entertainment

653
00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:27,520
for the Max Fund Network every week.

654
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:32,240
But I don't know, it's incredibly, incredibly flattering.

655
00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:33,840
I never thought that guaranteed it would support us like that.

656
00:36:33,840 --> 00:36:35,760
Netflix does not love you as much as we love you.

657
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:39,040
No, Netflix is fucking shitty, they send you broken disks

658
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:41,040
and you don't realize it until you put it in your Xbox

659
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:42,480
and it's just shrapnel in there.

660
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:44,560
I also hear they fart in every-

661
00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:48,480
They fart on every, here's the thing though, it's only certain movies.

662
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:50,800
So like if you get Hope Floats, that's a farter.

663
00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:54,560
If you get Serendipity, that's a farter.

664
00:36:54,560 --> 00:36:56,720
If you get The Lake House, that's a farter.

665
00:36:56,720 --> 00:36:58,880
Why is it all like romantic comedies?

666
00:36:58,880 --> 00:37:00,480
It's all romantic comedies.

667
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:03,760
If it has John Cusack in it and he kisses a woman at the end,

668
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:05,840
then don't touch the disk with your bare hands.

669
00:37:05,840 --> 00:37:06,400
That's all I'm saying.

670
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:08,000
Except for Must Love Dogs, Must Love Dogs is safe.

671
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:10,400
Except for Must Love Dogs, that's the only fart-free one.

672
00:37:11,120 --> 00:37:12,240
Because it is made of farts.

673
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:14,880
Because it is a literal, oh man.

674
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:17,200
Maximumfun.org for size donate is the link.

675
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:19,840
Click it and just think about it, think about your options.

676
00:37:19,840 --> 00:37:24,160
I'm in a rock band and may or may not be attempting to climb a stardom.

677
00:37:24,160 --> 00:37:28,960
We've written a handful of songs and started playing them at a local karaoke.

678
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:31,040
Sorry, that word is not in this question.

679
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:37,280
I'm playing out at local venues and said horse shows.

680
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:40,400
No, house shows, not horse shows.

681
00:37:41,360 --> 00:37:46,960
My problem is that after every set whenever someone attempts to compliment me on our music,

682
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:50,880
I have an overwhelming urge to ask them questions about the songs,

683
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:54,080
about my playing, about literally anything I can think of.

684
00:37:55,040 --> 00:37:58,000
So my question is this, how far can I go with this?

685
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:02,240
Should I ask a question at all or just nod and thank them?

686
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:05,520
And that's from Noteless in New Jersey.

687
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:12,320
Guys, this reason, this question is, this is not a joke,

688
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:14,800
literally the reason I had to stop doing community theater.

689
00:38:16,240 --> 00:38:16,560
Really?

690
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:21,680
Because coming off, there's no, whether you're in the audience or coming off the stage,

691
00:38:21,680 --> 00:38:28,160
coming off the stage, that 15 minute period afterwards where people have to come up to you

692
00:38:28,160 --> 00:38:34,800
and tell you how sweet your voice is or you have to tell them how you were moved and touched

693
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:37,760
by this particular performance of Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat

694
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:42,880
is like the worst human interaction I think that you can be party to.

695
00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:46,560
Yeah, and if I may, Noteless, here's the problem.

696
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:50,240
No matter what you ask them, you're not going to believe their response.

697
00:38:50,240 --> 00:38:50,880
No.

698
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:52,320
Everyone's lying.

699
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:54,800
Yeah, and if you say like, hey, so what'd you think?

700
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:56,320
And they're like, man, it was so good.

701
00:38:56,320 --> 00:38:58,160
And you're like, no, really, honestly, what did you think?

702
00:38:58,160 --> 00:38:59,680
No, really, it was so good.

703
00:38:59,680 --> 00:39:02,080
I mean, okay, you can tell me like, cause we're trying to get better.

704
00:39:02,080 --> 00:39:02,960
No, it was so good.

705
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:03,360
So good.

706
00:39:04,080 --> 00:39:05,600
You're like the early shins.

707
00:39:05,600 --> 00:39:06,880
I like it so much.

708
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:10,800
There is no affirmation they can give you that you're going to go, oh, okay.

709
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:12,560
Do you know what's going to be affirmation?

710
00:39:13,120 --> 00:39:16,400
When you get wet panties flung on stage at show.

711
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:17,520
That's how you're going to know.

712
00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:18,560
And they have to be wet?

713
00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:19,600
Why do they have to be wet?

714
00:39:19,600 --> 00:39:20,960
I don't know.

715
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:21,680
Why are these wet?

716
00:39:21,680 --> 00:39:24,000
Hey, who threw these wet panties up on the stage?

717
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:26,640
That's gross.

718
00:39:26,640 --> 00:39:29,120
I think they have to be wet for aerodynamic purposes.

719
00:39:29,120 --> 00:39:30,400
I don't think you're going to cut one.

720
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:31,280
That's true.

721
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:31,760
Yeah, it's like.

722
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:34,240
Oh no, if they're dry, there's not enough mass to them.

723
00:39:34,240 --> 00:39:35,040
They won't fall.

724
00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:36,320
Inertia, you need the mass.

725
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:37,200
Yeah, you need inertia.

726
00:39:39,120 --> 00:39:43,440
That's like the Foo Fighters had to ask people to stop throwing Mentos at them when they

727
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:47,440
played Big Me because they are hard.

728
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:48,640
Yeah, they're like little bullets.

729
00:39:48,640 --> 00:39:49,600
Little minty bullets.

730
00:39:49,600 --> 00:39:50,320
Please don't do that.

731
00:39:51,520 --> 00:39:56,000
You're never going to get an honesty from people who are there, presumably your friends,

732
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:59,920
or even if they're not, like they're there, they're looking you dead in the eye.

733
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:01,840
If you want honesty, get on the internet.

734
00:40:01,840 --> 00:40:03,120
Everyone will fucking hate you.

735
00:40:03,120 --> 00:40:06,080
The only reason that we're saying this, yes, thank you Justin.

736
00:40:06,080 --> 00:40:09,840
The only reason that we're saying this is because I have never said anything bad about

737
00:40:09,840 --> 00:40:13,440
any art anyone's ever done to their face.

738
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:17,440
And I try not to say it on internet even because I know how nasty the internet gets.

739
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:18,960
Oh boy, howdy, does it ever.

740
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:20,800
Sheeminy creaminy.

741
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:25,440
And you know the double-edged sword is like maybe, see, everybody also has that like one

742
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:28,560
friend that's like their straight shooter friend that will be like, I'm going to give

743
00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:29,600
you my honest opinion.

744
00:40:29,600 --> 00:40:33,520
And you would think that in your mind, you're like, that's exactly what I want.

745
00:40:33,520 --> 00:40:35,840
I want an honest opinion so I can grow and improve.

746
00:40:35,840 --> 00:40:36,640
But you don't.

747
00:40:36,640 --> 00:40:40,240
You super don't because then Jerry's like, I don't know, man, it just sounded a little

748
00:40:40,240 --> 00:40:42,560
derivative of New Fugazi.

749
00:40:42,560 --> 00:40:43,520
Do they have new stuff?

750
00:40:44,320 --> 00:40:46,000
It sounds like New Fugazi to me.

751
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:50,880
If Fugazi had continued to operate as a band in an alternate dimension, this sounds very

752
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:51,360
derivative of that.

753
00:40:51,360 --> 00:40:52,480
This sounds derivative of that.

754
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:55,680
Then you would say, well, Jerry, thank you for your honest opinion.

755
00:40:55,680 --> 00:40:57,840
And then in your bed at night at 4 a.m.

756
00:40:57,840 --> 00:41:01,680
because you can't fucking sleep, you're like, God damn it, Jerry, my whole life is in white.

757
00:41:01,680 --> 00:41:03,760
Why didn't you just fucking say it was good and walk away?

758
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:04,880
Why'd you straight shoot me?

759
00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:06,400
Why'd you straight shoot me in the heart?

760
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:11,440
That's why that's actually why people started bringing flowers to things because you could

761
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:16,320
give someone flowers and then walk away and you don't have to say anything.

762
00:41:16,320 --> 00:41:20,320
And later they'll think, I must have talked to them because I have flowers here.

763
00:41:20,320 --> 00:41:21,040
Hey, take these.

764
00:41:21,040 --> 00:41:21,600
Oh, thank you.

765
00:41:21,600 --> 00:41:22,160
What do you think?

766
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:24,640
I just fucking gave you flowers.

767
00:41:24,640 --> 00:41:27,280
Like, I shouldn't have to tell you that.

768
00:41:27,280 --> 00:41:28,400
The interaction's over.

769
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:29,280
I went to Kroger.

770
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:29,680
We're done.

771
00:41:29,680 --> 00:41:30,800
I went to Kroger.

772
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:33,840
To be fair, you guys, I think you're letting your theater show because I don't think a lot

773
00:41:33,840 --> 00:41:36,400
of people roll up to rock shows with flowers.

774
00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:39,440
Maestro, maestro, one more.

775
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:41,120
Maestro, maestro, one more.

776
00:41:41,120 --> 00:41:41,840
I say play on.

777
00:41:41,840 --> 00:41:43,840
Bravissimo, bravissimo.

778
00:41:47,840 --> 00:41:49,840
The flowers have to be wet though or else they won't travel.

779
00:41:51,120 --> 00:41:52,000
Don't do this.

780
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:53,760
Just say, thank you so much.

781
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:56,160
And we really appreciate you coming.

782
00:41:56,160 --> 00:41:56,960
Thank you so much.

783
00:41:56,960 --> 00:41:57,920
I really appreciate it.

784
00:41:57,920 --> 00:41:58,400
Did we?

785
00:41:58,400 --> 00:41:59,600
Because I mean, after our live shows-

786
00:41:59,600 --> 00:42:03,840
Can you imagine if we did a My Brother, My Brother, Me live show and someone came up

787
00:42:03,840 --> 00:42:05,920
afterwards and they were like, hey, that was funny.

788
00:42:05,920 --> 00:42:10,320
And I was like, go on, let's down.

789
00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:16,000
Tell me, are you physically exhausted from laughing?

790
00:42:18,560 --> 00:42:24,880
Yeah, I mean, we don't, like after our live shows, we usually just like fucking just like

791
00:42:24,880 --> 00:42:25,600
hang, right?

792
00:42:25,600 --> 00:42:28,320
Like we're almost ashamed of the shit that we just did and we don't want to talk about

793
00:42:28,320 --> 00:42:28,400
it.

794
00:42:28,400 --> 00:42:29,040
Let's move on.

795
00:42:30,240 --> 00:42:31,200
No, I'm not joking.

796
00:42:31,200 --> 00:42:35,520
That's typically like, after our first live show at Second City,

797
00:42:35,520 --> 00:42:36,480
we went out to that bar.

798
00:42:37,120 --> 00:42:40,400
It was my birthday and I don't remember a lot of it because fucking Rocky Horror got

799
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:41,360
me blackout.

800
00:42:41,920 --> 00:42:45,840
But like, we all just drank and didn't talk about it, I feel like.

801
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:47,840
Am I misremembering?

802
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:48,960
No, you're right.

803
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:49,440
No, I didn't.

804
00:42:49,440 --> 00:42:50,240
I didn't talk about it.

805
00:42:50,240 --> 00:42:51,600
I don't want to talk about it.

806
00:42:51,600 --> 00:42:52,080
That's the thing.

807
00:42:52,080 --> 00:42:53,280
I don't want to talk about it now.

808
00:42:53,280 --> 00:42:54,560
We're talking a big game, but like-

809
00:42:55,120 --> 00:42:58,640
That's actually the worst part about this is getting so stupid.

810
00:42:58,640 --> 00:43:05,760
But like, when we do a live show and then we talk to people afterwards, I really like

811
00:43:07,360 --> 00:43:13,440
being in any way like entertaining or worth listening to, I don't know if this is this

812
00:43:13,440 --> 00:43:18,400
way for genuinely talented people, but for me is a finite resource.

813
00:43:18,400 --> 00:43:18,800
Yeah.

814
00:43:18,800 --> 00:43:23,280
I put it all into like an hour of doing a live show afterwards.

815
00:43:23,280 --> 00:43:26,080
Like, I know I suck.

816
00:43:26,080 --> 00:43:27,600
Like, I am not funny.

817
00:43:27,600 --> 00:43:33,760
I do not have any, whatever neurons those are that connect me to saying like, not even

818
00:43:33,760 --> 00:43:36,720
funny, like applicable, like even relevant.

819
00:43:36,720 --> 00:43:38,240
You fried all of those connections.

820
00:43:38,240 --> 00:43:42,720
You can chart that between, so our Chicago live show where we did like 20 minutes and

821
00:43:42,720 --> 00:43:44,720
then we're like, what's up?

822
00:43:44,720 --> 00:43:45,840
Oh, this guy.

823
00:43:45,840 --> 00:43:50,640
And then our Austin live show when we did two back to back hour long episodes and went

824
00:43:50,640 --> 00:43:53,200
out for like five and a half minutes and we're like, uh.

825
00:43:53,200 --> 00:43:55,760
And fell asleep on the tables in the back of that monk's place.

826
00:43:55,760 --> 00:43:57,440
Do you have a Yahoo?

827
00:43:57,440 --> 00:43:58,160
I have a few.

828
00:43:58,160 --> 00:44:01,360
This Yahoo answer was sent in by Reed.

829
00:44:01,360 --> 00:44:02,000
Thank you, Reed.

830
00:44:03,440 --> 00:44:07,040
It's by Yahoo Answers user, Miomi, who asks, well, I quitted karate.

831
00:44:07,040 --> 00:44:08,080
Is that a good decision?

832
00:44:10,080 --> 00:44:10,960
Trainings are hard.

833
00:44:10,960 --> 00:44:12,160
My bro told me to quit.

834
00:44:12,160 --> 00:44:12,960
Oh, Jesus.

835
00:44:12,960 --> 00:44:13,840
Trainings are hard.

836
00:44:13,840 --> 00:44:17,440
My bro told me to quit because I didn't want to attend karate, so I quitted.

837
00:44:18,160 --> 00:44:20,320
My parents don't.

838
00:44:20,320 --> 00:44:22,640
Hey, did you, were you found guilty for karate?

839
00:44:22,640 --> 00:44:23,440
No, I was acquitted.

840
00:44:23,440 --> 00:44:29,920
My parents don't want me to quit because they wanted me to protect myself when I grow older.

841
00:44:29,920 --> 00:44:31,920
So is it a good or bad decision to quit?

842
00:44:33,920 --> 00:44:35,120
There's so many factors here.

843
00:44:35,120 --> 00:44:41,520
Do you guys know anybody who did karate coming up?

844
00:44:42,480 --> 00:44:43,440
Yes, I do.

845
00:44:43,440 --> 00:44:44,000
I knew one.

846
00:44:44,880 --> 00:44:45,600
Chris Sizemore?

847
00:44:46,400 --> 00:44:46,960
Derek Moore.

848
00:44:47,680 --> 00:44:50,000
But like, here's the thing.

849
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:56,160
I feel like there was a mythos around karate or all forms of kung fu, and there still is,

850
00:44:56,160 --> 00:44:58,400
which is I'm learning it for self-defense.

851
00:44:58,400 --> 00:45:05,040
I don't think that situation has ever unfolded organically in the history of pugilism.

852
00:45:05,600 --> 00:45:12,320
I think that somebody who has dedicated 20 years of their life to mastering kung fu,

853
00:45:13,040 --> 00:45:18,320
and then they get in one bar fight, in that bar fight, in that moment, that primal moment

854
00:45:18,320 --> 00:45:22,080
of punch, they do not go, what did my sensei teach me?

855
00:45:23,120 --> 00:45:26,640
See, I disagree, because I think in the moment of punch, it probably comes up,

856
00:45:26,640 --> 00:45:31,120
but like in the dark alley where a dude like pulls a gun, you're probably not thinking like,

857
00:45:31,120 --> 00:45:31,680
I want to karate.

858
00:45:31,680 --> 00:45:36,160
Well, no, because you're not going to fucking like throw a ball of chi at him.

859
00:45:36,160 --> 00:45:37,920
Like that's obviously not going to work.

860
00:45:37,920 --> 00:45:39,120
Have you guys seen that thing though?

861
00:45:39,120 --> 00:45:43,520
When you're fucking, when you're careening towards that drunk truck driver,

862
00:45:43,520 --> 00:45:46,240
you're not going to kung fu his car out of the way, Travis.

863
00:45:46,240 --> 00:45:51,840
When this, when the fucking sun explodes and we experience the heat death of the universe,

864
00:45:51,840 --> 00:45:53,680
you're not going to fucking kick your way out of that one.

865
00:45:53,680 --> 00:45:56,640
Can I tell you the funny thing is though, as soon as someone says like self-defense,

866
00:45:56,640 --> 00:45:59,600
I'm taking it for self-defense, that is what I picture like fighting off.

867
00:45:59,600 --> 00:46:03,600
I'm 95 years old and this coronary is about to get me, but let me just chop it.

868
00:46:04,880 --> 00:46:05,360
Done.

869
00:46:05,360 --> 00:46:05,840
Fixed it.

870
00:46:06,960 --> 00:46:07,920
Fixed it with a chop.

871
00:46:07,920 --> 00:46:08,720
It's cool now.

872
00:46:08,720 --> 00:46:09,760
Got it with a chop.

873
00:46:09,760 --> 00:46:11,360
90 years of kung fu paid off.

874
00:46:11,360 --> 00:46:17,760
Yeah, people say they do it to defend themselves and if you really pound that math out,

875
00:46:18,480 --> 00:46:22,720
it is a bad investment no matter which way it breaks.

876
00:46:22,720 --> 00:46:23,280
Inconceivable.

877
00:46:23,280 --> 00:46:27,600
In this situation, in this situation that you're, that you're envisioning,

878
00:46:28,160 --> 00:46:33,760
you're in mano a mano combat, hand to hand, no weapons allowed.

879
00:46:33,760 --> 00:46:40,000
Because make no mistake, my friend, if you have karate and he has insert sharp thing here,

880
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:40,960
you lose.

881
00:46:40,960 --> 00:46:41,600
You lose.

882
00:46:41,600 --> 00:46:42,480
It's over.

883
00:46:42,480 --> 00:46:43,680
You get stabbed.

884
00:46:43,680 --> 00:46:48,240
That's why, that's why fucking knives and swords and guns were invented is because people

885
00:46:48,240 --> 00:46:51,680
like this fuck hole on yahoo is like karate is too hard.

886
00:46:51,680 --> 00:46:53,200
I wish there was a substitute.

887
00:46:53,200 --> 00:46:58,320
Oh, you're telling me this knife is worth a hundred billion years of karate.

888
00:46:58,320 --> 00:46:59,840
Okay, I'll just take that then.

889
00:46:59,840 --> 00:47:00,960
It's way easier.

890
00:47:00,960 --> 00:47:03,440
Yeah, how about just bring some mace with you?

891
00:47:03,440 --> 00:47:06,160
Because what you're talking about is four hours a week, right?

892
00:47:06,160 --> 00:47:12,800
Yeah, like an hour a week for a month, something like 50 hours a year of karate.

893
00:47:12,800 --> 00:47:14,240
You just pulled all that out of your butt.

894
00:47:15,120 --> 00:47:15,520
Why?

895
00:47:15,520 --> 00:47:16,160
That's nothing wrong.

896
00:47:16,160 --> 00:47:18,000
Based on the latest statistics.

897
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:18,560
The latest statistics.

898
00:47:18,560 --> 00:47:27,120
Hours a year of karate training versus like the one opportunity you may ever have to just

899
00:47:27,120 --> 00:47:31,040
not get your ass beat as bad as your ass would have gotten beaten.

900
00:47:31,040 --> 00:47:35,520
Also with those karate classes, from what I know from watching movies and TV shows,

901
00:47:35,520 --> 00:47:37,360
you get your ass beat a lot.

902
00:47:37,360 --> 00:47:41,680
You get thrown around and people beat the shit out of you.

903
00:47:41,680 --> 00:47:43,520
Right now, I've never been in a fight in my life.

904
00:47:43,520 --> 00:47:46,320
I feel like I've talked about this in the podcast before, and I'm afraid that first

905
00:47:46,320 --> 00:47:47,440
punch I'd be done.

906
00:47:47,440 --> 00:47:51,040
So maybe being in kung fu classes gets the shit beaten out of you, so you're a little

907
00:47:51,040 --> 00:47:52,880
bit more used to getting the shit beaten out of you.

908
00:47:52,880 --> 00:47:54,240
But at the same time, it seems so...

909
00:47:55,600 --> 00:47:59,280
I say this, but I watch Tony Jaa and he's on some next level shit.

910
00:47:59,280 --> 00:48:02,640
I think that if he got embroiled, he would come out the victor.

911
00:48:02,640 --> 00:48:07,680
But I guarantee he's not going to master Tony's, you know, Taekwondo class.

912
00:48:07,680 --> 00:48:12,640
Right, because that shit, you're like outside a bar and a dude is drunk and coming after

913
00:48:12,640 --> 00:48:12,960
you.

914
00:48:12,960 --> 00:48:15,520
You're not going to be like, so are you doing crane style or Taekwondo?

915
00:48:15,520 --> 00:48:16,080
Oh, fuck.

916
00:48:17,440 --> 00:48:23,440
And right now, I know there are dozens of people that are shouting at their iPods saying,

917
00:48:23,440 --> 00:48:28,560
I don't do martial arts for self-defense.

918
00:48:28,560 --> 00:48:31,600
I do it for mental clarity and physical exercise.

919
00:48:31,600 --> 00:48:33,200
And newsflash.

920
00:48:33,200 --> 00:48:34,960
I can kick all your asses.

921
00:48:34,960 --> 00:48:36,000
If you are in a bar...

922
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:36,880
Blanket statement.

923
00:48:36,880 --> 00:48:39,280
If you see me, fucking bring it.

924
00:48:39,280 --> 00:48:40,720
I will take you to clown town.

925
00:48:41,600 --> 00:48:42,240
Go ahead, Justin.

926
00:48:42,880 --> 00:48:43,760
Oh, thanks.

927
00:48:45,120 --> 00:48:45,920
There's a fight.

928
00:48:46,720 --> 00:48:48,880
They are looking to you.

929
00:48:48,880 --> 00:48:50,080
You are the guy.

930
00:48:50,080 --> 00:48:53,040
You cannot use the excuse of, no, I just do martial...

931
00:48:53,040 --> 00:48:53,600
No, no, no.

932
00:48:54,240 --> 00:48:59,760
They're going to look to you, Kung Fu Kim or whatever your name is, to fight this fight

933
00:48:59,760 --> 00:49:00,160
for them.

934
00:49:00,160 --> 00:49:01,120
Mm-hmm.

935
00:49:01,120 --> 00:49:03,920
You're setting up unrealistic expectations, is what I'm saying.

936
00:49:04,720 --> 00:49:05,680
And I will say this, too.

937
00:49:06,320 --> 00:49:07,680
I mean, counterpoint.

938
00:49:08,480 --> 00:49:12,560
If I were about to fight a dude in a bar and somebody else in the bar was like, you know,

939
00:49:12,560 --> 00:49:14,080
he's a black belt, right?

940
00:49:14,080 --> 00:49:15,280
I would run away.

941
00:49:16,160 --> 00:49:17,120
It is good for that.

942
00:49:17,120 --> 00:49:18,160
It is good for intimidation.

943
00:49:18,160 --> 00:49:18,960
It's intimidation.

944
00:49:18,960 --> 00:49:19,120
But...

945
00:49:19,120 --> 00:49:20,560
I would totally leave the situation.

946
00:49:20,560 --> 00:49:27,760
Is there such a thing as a dojo run by like a drunk dock worker?

947
00:49:27,760 --> 00:49:31,920
Yeah, I have a judge you could try, it's called all of them.

948
00:49:36,480 --> 00:49:43,360
If there was an illegal boxing gambling ring run by a drunk dock worker, that is the kind

949
00:49:43,360 --> 00:49:44,720
of shit that I would be on.

950
00:49:45,440 --> 00:49:46,160
You know what I mean?

951
00:49:46,160 --> 00:49:50,400
Yeah, like where's the dojo that like teaches you to like punch sides of beef?

952
00:49:50,400 --> 00:49:56,320
I'm a Miller's High Life belt at my dojo, and it's just a belt, just like a regular

953
00:49:56,320 --> 00:49:58,240
belt with a Miller's High Life label stuck on it.

954
00:49:58,240 --> 00:49:59,920
But it's the next to highest one you can get.

955
00:49:59,920 --> 00:50:00,640
It's the champagne.

956
00:50:00,640 --> 00:50:01,360
You know what?

957
00:50:01,360 --> 00:50:04,240
I would go to a dojo run by like Norman Reedus.

958
00:50:05,040 --> 00:50:06,560
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

959
00:50:06,560 --> 00:50:09,600
I wouldn't be in that kind of fighting.

960
00:50:09,600 --> 00:50:13,200
He kind of is like a drunk, the drunk dock worker of actors though.

961
00:50:13,200 --> 00:50:13,440
Right?

962
00:50:13,440 --> 00:50:28,640
Like, I think that the big problem with karate is I don't have an end of the sentence.

963
00:50:28,640 --> 00:50:30,960
It keeps taking our jobs is the issue.

964
00:50:31,520 --> 00:50:32,080
Sure.

965
00:50:32,080 --> 00:50:34,320
Something, something, whatever.

966
00:50:35,440 --> 00:50:37,120
Let's ask, let's answer a real question.

967
00:50:37,120 --> 00:50:38,400
Nobody does kung fu anymore.

968
00:50:38,960 --> 00:50:40,400
Nobody's ever done kung fu again.

969
00:50:40,400 --> 00:50:42,480
I'm sorry if we hurt your feelings and you do kung fu.

970
00:50:42,480 --> 00:50:45,520
Now, that's some shit.

971
00:50:45,520 --> 00:50:46,160
That's some shit.

972
00:50:46,160 --> 00:50:48,160
I can crowd McGraw or Tim McGraw.

973
00:50:50,400 --> 00:50:53,600
Welcome to Tom, welcome to Tim McGraw's crowd McGraw.

974
00:50:54,320 --> 00:50:57,520
I'll teach you how to tumble, how to throw somebody, use their weight against them and

975
00:50:57,520 --> 00:50:59,280
not get your head knocked off.

976
00:50:59,280 --> 00:51:01,760
Welcome to Tom McGraw's Tim McGraw crowd McGraw.

977
00:51:01,760 --> 00:51:03,200
Hi, I'm Tom McGraw.

978
00:51:03,200 --> 00:51:06,080
People tell me I look like Tim McGraw, but that's just because my name sounds the same.

979
00:51:06,080 --> 00:51:07,600
Who wants to learn how to tussle?

980
00:51:07,600 --> 00:51:12,160
My brother Tim McGraw taught me his fighting style of crowd McGraw that he invented.

981
00:51:12,160 --> 00:51:13,680
I miss him every day.

982
00:51:13,680 --> 00:51:15,280
I miss him so much.

983
00:51:15,280 --> 00:51:16,240
I miss him.

984
00:51:16,240 --> 00:51:18,160
He died in a crowd McGraw accident.

985
00:51:18,880 --> 00:51:21,680
I've been pretending to be him for the last 20 years.

986
00:51:22,640 --> 00:51:24,080
Have you had sex with Faith Hill?

987
00:51:24,080 --> 00:51:24,640
No?

988
00:51:24,640 --> 00:51:26,160
Well, come on, let's crowd McGraw.

989
00:51:29,680 --> 00:51:32,800
Everybody do in the crowd McGraw crowd.

990
00:51:32,800 --> 00:51:33,920
I don't think that was Tim McGraw.

991
00:51:33,920 --> 00:51:34,880
I don't think that was Tim McGraw.

992
00:51:34,880 --> 00:51:36,160
Everybody crowd McGraw.

993
00:51:36,160 --> 00:51:37,840
I don't think that was Tim McGraw.

994
00:51:37,840 --> 00:51:38,720
Everybody crowd McGraw like you were dying.

995
00:51:38,720 --> 00:51:39,680
Let's go.

996
00:51:39,680 --> 00:51:40,160
That one.

997
00:51:40,160 --> 00:51:40,800
That one works.

998
00:51:41,440 --> 00:51:42,000
Thank you.

999
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:46,560
Don't take the crowd McGraw lessons from my brother Tom.

1000
00:51:47,760 --> 00:51:49,600
Don't take his shit.

1001
00:51:49,600 --> 00:51:50,560
Don't take his shit.

1002
00:51:50,560 --> 00:51:51,520
Crowd McGraw him.

1003
00:51:53,440 --> 00:51:54,640
I mean, oh my God.

1004
00:51:56,240 --> 00:51:57,760
I'm an Indian crowd McGraw.

1005
00:51:58,480 --> 00:52:00,640
I'm Cherokee and Choctaw.

1006
00:52:00,640 --> 00:52:02,000
I'll flip you over my shoulder.

1007
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:11,040
Can anyone give me an I like it I love it?

1008
00:52:12,240 --> 00:52:13,200
I like it.

1009
00:52:13,200 --> 00:52:14,000
I love it.

1010
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:15,760
I chopped that guy's arm off.

1011
00:52:18,080 --> 00:52:19,520
All right, let's answer a question.

1012
00:52:20,720 --> 00:52:22,640
I love my boyfriend of a year.

1013
00:52:22,640 --> 00:52:26,320
Oh man, guys, I got to start reading these before I start reading them.

1014
00:52:26,320 --> 00:52:27,440
Got to do a little prep.

1015
00:52:27,440 --> 00:52:28,480
A little pre pro.

1016
00:52:28,480 --> 00:52:31,280
I love my boyfriend of over a year very much.

1017
00:52:31,280 --> 00:52:34,080
However, something's been bothering me lately.

1018
00:52:34,080 --> 00:52:37,680
Whenever I need to vent to him about a hard day or someone I don't like,

1019
00:52:37,680 --> 00:52:40,160
he always feels the need to play devil's advocate,

1020
00:52:40,160 --> 00:52:43,600
telling me they have a point or that I shouldn't have done something

1021
00:52:43,600 --> 00:52:46,640
when all I really wanted was to get it off my chest.

1022
00:52:46,640 --> 00:52:49,280
I know not everything that bothers me is entirely reasonable,

1023
00:52:49,280 --> 00:52:50,640
but sometimes I just need to hear.

1024
00:52:51,280 --> 00:52:53,120
I just need to hear what I want to hear.

1025
00:52:53,760 --> 00:52:55,200
What should I tell him?

1026
00:52:55,200 --> 00:52:55,760
Thanks.

1027
00:52:55,760 --> 00:52:57,840
That's from can't vent in Kentucky.

1028
00:52:57,840 --> 00:53:01,760
It sounds like this dude's first time being a boyfriend.

1029
00:53:01,760 --> 00:53:07,120
It sounds like his first significant other of any gender.

1030
00:53:08,080 --> 00:53:11,280
It might also be his first time trying to be like a good boyfriend.

1031
00:53:12,080 --> 00:53:12,400
What do you mean?

1032
00:53:12,400 --> 00:53:14,800
It might be possible that he's been an SO before.

1033
00:53:15,520 --> 00:53:16,800
And was just a shithead?

1034
00:53:17,360 --> 00:53:19,360
Yeah, well, here's the thing.

1035
00:53:19,360 --> 00:53:20,400
I'm bad at this too.

1036
00:53:21,200 --> 00:53:23,200
Like I completely relate to this dude.

1037
00:53:23,200 --> 00:53:27,840
Oh, this is so awful to tell you how horrible I am at reading human emotions.

1038
00:53:27,840 --> 00:53:29,920
I actually have taken the shorthand.

1039
00:53:29,920 --> 00:53:32,240
And like when Teresa will start to vent about something,

1040
00:53:32,240 --> 00:53:33,600
I will literally say,

1041
00:53:33,600 --> 00:53:37,280
do you want me to be supportive boyfriend or devil's advocate boyfriend?

1042
00:53:37,280 --> 00:53:38,160
There is litter.

1043
00:53:38,160 --> 00:53:41,200
I do the exact same thing and maybe that's cheating.

1044
00:53:41,200 --> 00:53:44,320
I don't know, but it seems to work better than guessing.

1045
00:53:44,320 --> 00:53:47,120
Yeah, it is cheating because like I don't do that.

1046
00:53:47,120 --> 00:53:50,400
I have to just read, you know, read the room, read the variables.

1047
00:53:50,400 --> 00:53:53,440
Is she perioding, right fellas?

1048
00:53:54,160 --> 00:53:54,720
High five.

1049
00:53:56,320 --> 00:53:56,960
Skype five.

1050
00:53:57,600 --> 00:53:58,080
Why five?

1051
00:53:59,360 --> 00:54:00,320
I like that.

1052
00:54:00,320 --> 00:54:01,280
That's a good one.

1053
00:54:01,280 --> 00:54:03,840
No, I mean, I don't know what to say.

1054
00:54:03,840 --> 00:54:07,120
Sometimes you just want to say something out loud

1055
00:54:07,120 --> 00:54:09,200
and you don't necessarily want an argument about it.

1056
00:54:09,200 --> 00:54:12,320
You just want to be angry for a while.

1057
00:54:12,320 --> 00:54:16,240
There was a moment last night where Teresa was telling me a story about something

1058
00:54:16,240 --> 00:54:20,080
and I was just staring at her waiting for her to like ask for my opinion

1059
00:54:20,080 --> 00:54:22,000
or ask for me like what to do.

1060
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:25,920
And she finished the sentence and didn't have anything else to say.

1061
00:54:25,920 --> 00:54:27,280
And I was just staring at her.

1062
00:54:29,280 --> 00:54:31,200
She's like, and I'm really upset about that.

1063
00:54:31,200 --> 00:54:32,880
And I was like, oh yeah, no, that's shitty.

1064
00:54:32,880 --> 00:54:33,440
That's awful.

1065
00:54:35,040 --> 00:54:36,560
Were you, honestly time,

1066
00:54:37,200 --> 00:54:40,960
were you listening to the completeness of the thought?

1067
00:54:41,920 --> 00:54:43,120
It was one of two things.

1068
00:54:43,120 --> 00:54:46,800
I was either so deep in it that I couldn't see the light to get out

1069
00:54:47,360 --> 00:54:49,760
or I was thinking about like pizza.

1070
00:54:49,760 --> 00:54:55,440
You were pondering an earlier phrase that she said.

1071
00:54:55,440 --> 00:54:59,520
You were so busy processing that that you didn't hear the punchline.

1072
00:55:00,400 --> 00:55:01,200
That might be true.

1073
00:55:01,200 --> 00:55:03,760
You didn't, you were so stuck on the descending action.

1074
00:55:03,760 --> 00:55:09,360
It is really hard to shake the impulse to fix.

1075
00:55:10,080 --> 00:55:14,960
And I think that that's something that I've always struggled with in my relationships

1076
00:55:14,960 --> 00:55:22,880
that I never have, and I think Sydney is the first relationship I've been in

1077
00:55:22,880 --> 00:55:28,000
where like I finally, because of just her telling me what I'm doing wrong

1078
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:30,160
and me sort of realizing it on my own and growing up,

1079
00:55:30,160 --> 00:55:35,360
like it seems like a very healthy impulse to like want to fix everything.

1080
00:55:35,360 --> 00:55:40,400
But man, that can, you can get into a bad situation very fast.

1081
00:55:40,400 --> 00:55:42,480
The issue is like, I'm always that guy.

1082
00:55:42,480 --> 00:55:45,040
I am always like, well, let me find a way to help you.

1083
00:55:45,040 --> 00:55:48,320
And so the way that it breaks down for me, again, let me preface,

1084
00:55:48,320 --> 00:55:51,280
I'm awful at this, is I have a two-step process.

1085
00:55:51,280 --> 00:55:56,080
And the first step is, is there anything I can do directly to fix this?

1086
00:55:56,080 --> 00:55:58,640
To which the answer is almost always no.

1087
00:55:59,680 --> 00:56:03,280
And then step two is, can you find a teacher or an adult?

1088
00:56:04,720 --> 00:56:07,760
Can you find a teacher or an adult that can help you out with this problem?

1089
00:56:07,760 --> 00:56:09,760
Because there's an adult out there somewhere that will help you,

1090
00:56:09,760 --> 00:56:12,640
a parent or a teacher or a trusted close friend.

1091
00:56:12,640 --> 00:56:16,640
Sydney has had problems, was having problems sleeping recently.

1092
00:56:16,640 --> 00:56:22,960
And I tried to advise her with my vast amount of sleep knowledge.

1093
00:56:23,840 --> 00:56:26,000
And then I realized that that didn't work.

1094
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:30,640
So I found out who the sleep doctor was at the hospital where she works

1095
00:56:30,640 --> 00:56:33,600
and started insisting that she talked to him because he's an adult.

1096
00:56:34,320 --> 00:56:36,320
That is what I'm saying. It's a foolproof method.

1097
00:56:36,320 --> 00:56:37,920
I've gone through my entire checklist.

1098
00:56:37,920 --> 00:56:39,360
I'm going to bump you up to an adult.

1099
00:56:39,360 --> 00:56:42,080
Listen, I got to elevate, I got to escalate this.

1100
00:56:42,080 --> 00:56:43,520
I really have nothing for you.

1101
00:56:44,160 --> 00:56:46,320
I don't know any teachers anymore.

1102
00:56:46,320 --> 00:56:47,440
They all fucking died.

1103
00:56:49,360 --> 00:56:52,880
It's really unfortunate because you can't, I mean, it's frustrating.

1104
00:56:52,880 --> 00:56:54,320
I get it from the guy's perspective.

1105
00:56:54,320 --> 00:56:56,960
I mean, the devil's advocate thing, that's easy.

1106
00:56:56,960 --> 00:56:59,360
Here's when people want you to be devil's advocate.

1107
00:56:59,360 --> 00:57:00,320
A never.

1108
00:57:00,320 --> 00:57:02,320
Like they don't ever want that.

1109
00:57:02,320 --> 00:57:04,400
Trust me, they know what the flip side is.

1110
00:57:04,400 --> 00:57:06,560
They don't need you to illuminate that for them.

1111
00:57:06,560 --> 00:57:09,120
You can put your boyfriend on the line if you want.

1112
00:57:09,120 --> 00:57:10,080
We can tell him that.

1113
00:57:10,080 --> 00:57:12,080
It might not hurt to say like,

1114
00:57:12,080 --> 00:57:14,000
I'm just going to vent for a second, but.

1115
00:57:14,640 --> 00:57:15,920
But what if they need that truth?

1116
00:57:15,920 --> 00:57:19,040
What if they're saying some bullshit

1117
00:57:19,040 --> 00:57:21,760
and they need you to fucking grab them, pull them back down.

1118
00:57:21,760 --> 00:57:23,200
Do you want to know the answer, Griffin?

1119
00:57:23,200 --> 00:57:24,800
You don't do it.

1120
00:57:24,800 --> 00:57:27,200
But what if they need it, Travis?

1121
00:57:27,200 --> 00:57:28,160
This is what I'm saying.

1122
00:57:28,720 --> 00:57:31,120
What if they need it and that's secretly what they want?

1123
00:57:31,120 --> 00:57:33,040
Is somebody telling them no stop?

1124
00:57:34,880 --> 00:57:35,360
They don't.

1125
00:57:35,360 --> 00:57:36,400
Wait, what?

1126
00:57:36,400 --> 00:57:37,840
Want someone to disagree with them?

1127
00:57:37,840 --> 00:57:38,080
Yeah.

1128
00:57:38,720 --> 00:57:39,040
Never.

1129
00:57:39,600 --> 00:57:40,320
But what if they do?

1130
00:57:40,320 --> 00:57:40,960
That's what I'm saying.

1131
00:57:40,960 --> 00:57:42,240
They don't.

1132
00:57:42,240 --> 00:57:42,960
But they don't.

1133
00:57:42,960 --> 00:57:44,800
What if they don't want it, but they need it?

1134
00:57:44,800 --> 00:57:46,240
Griffin, we're older than you.

1135
00:57:46,240 --> 00:57:47,280
They don't.

1136
00:57:47,280 --> 00:57:48,160
They don't.

1137
00:57:48,160 --> 00:57:49,040
They never do.

1138
00:57:49,680 --> 00:57:52,080
And I mean they as in all people.

1139
00:57:52,080 --> 00:57:55,120
Not like women or men, all people.

1140
00:57:55,120 --> 00:57:56,880
When I hear Sydney is wrong about something

1141
00:57:56,880 --> 00:57:58,720
or she's angry at someone else,

1142
00:57:58,720 --> 00:58:04,640
here is the extent to which that is not the J-Man's department.

1143
00:58:04,640 --> 00:58:05,600
Do you call an adult?

1144
00:58:05,600 --> 00:58:07,760
Do you call a teacher or an adult to come in and be like,

1145
00:58:07,760 --> 00:58:10,640
hey, nope, wrong, wrong girl.

1146
00:58:10,640 --> 00:58:12,240
I'm not getting into a fight with you

1147
00:58:12,240 --> 00:58:13,840
because this does not have an effect.

1148
00:58:13,840 --> 00:58:17,040
Justin called me in to tell you this, nope.

1149
00:58:17,040 --> 00:58:19,920
Here's another piece of advice to the question asker.

1150
00:58:20,960 --> 00:58:23,360
The time to discuss this with your boyfriend

1151
00:58:23,360 --> 00:58:25,360
is not in the middle of this situation.

1152
00:58:27,120 --> 00:58:27,760
Wait a minute.

1153
00:58:29,120 --> 00:58:29,840
No.

1154
00:58:29,840 --> 00:58:31,520
Who is going to start a conversation?

1155
00:58:31,520 --> 00:58:32,640
No one does that.

1156
00:58:32,640 --> 00:58:36,320
Hey, by the way, if I'm talking some bullshit anytime

1157
00:58:36,320 --> 00:58:38,160
in the discernible future.

1158
00:58:38,160 --> 00:58:40,560
No, what I'm saying is she, okay,

1159
00:58:40,560 --> 00:58:42,560
so she's upset enough to feel they need to vent

1160
00:58:43,280 --> 00:58:45,200
and then her boyfriend does something wrong.

1161
00:58:45,760 --> 00:58:48,960
I guarantee she ain't going into it with a cool level head

1162
00:58:48,960 --> 00:58:50,720
to be like, hey, honey, side note,

1163
00:58:50,720 --> 00:58:52,640
let me explain to you what's going on right now

1164
00:58:52,640 --> 00:58:53,920
and why I'm upset.

1165
00:58:53,920 --> 00:58:55,520
Well, okay, that's fine.

1166
00:58:55,520 --> 00:58:58,080
But the better thing is don't talk to him

1167
00:58:58,080 --> 00:59:00,160
and just let him listen to this part

1168
00:59:00,160 --> 00:59:03,040
and we'll tell him for you to not,

1169
00:59:03,040 --> 00:59:04,720
because that way it won't seem aggressive.

1170
00:59:04,720 --> 00:59:07,360
It's just like, hey, these zany brothers

1171
00:59:07,360 --> 00:59:09,680
who sometimes talk about eggs for 20 minutes

1172
00:59:09,680 --> 00:59:11,040
have a special message.

1173
00:59:11,040 --> 00:59:13,200
It was like 10, but also-

1174
00:59:13,200 --> 00:59:15,440
To be fair, Justin was adding in the 10 minutes

1175
00:59:15,440 --> 00:59:16,720
that we'll talk about eggs later.

1176
00:59:19,040 --> 00:59:21,280
It's just not worth, like, it's not a fight.

1177
00:59:21,280 --> 00:59:23,760
It's not a, you get no prize

1178
00:59:23,760 --> 00:59:26,240
for being righter than the other person or-

1179
00:59:26,240 --> 00:59:28,800
Because it very easily turns into you

1180
00:59:28,800 --> 00:59:31,520
shouldering the burden of the person they're mad at.

1181
00:59:31,520 --> 00:59:33,600
And that's what love is.

1182
00:59:34,400 --> 00:59:35,520
That's what you do.

1183
00:59:36,160 --> 00:59:37,440
How do you guys not get this?

1184
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:39,680
Whoever you're defending

1185
00:59:39,680 --> 00:59:43,200
will never, ever, ever, ever, ever

1186
00:59:43,200 --> 00:59:46,800
make you some coffee or give you a foot rub

1187
00:59:46,800 --> 00:59:48,480
or drive you to the airport.

1188
00:59:48,480 --> 00:59:49,760
It does not matter.

1189
00:59:49,760 --> 00:59:52,960
They lost the chance for you to be on their side

1190
00:59:52,960 --> 00:59:54,880
when they were not at the altar

1191
00:59:54,880 --> 00:59:57,120
or at the boyfriend vault with you.

1192
00:59:57,120 --> 00:59:59,520
At the boyfriend store.

1193
00:59:59,520 --> 01:00:01,040
They lost, they missed their chance

1194
01:00:01,040 --> 01:00:02,160
to have you on their team.

1195
01:00:02,160 --> 01:00:04,960
What I'm saying is they're not gonna do those things

1196
01:00:04,960 --> 01:00:08,320
unless you go to them and tell them what you did for them.

1197
01:00:08,320 --> 01:00:09,760
I asked it as your sur-

1198
01:00:09,760 --> 01:00:11,440
I was your second.

1199
01:00:11,440 --> 01:00:13,120
I was your surrogate.

1200
01:00:13,120 --> 01:00:14,160
I stood up for you.

1201
01:00:14,720 --> 01:00:15,680
Rub my tootsies.

1202
01:00:15,680 --> 01:00:17,760
You don't know me, Trisha's boss.

1203
01:00:17,760 --> 01:00:20,960
But I, can you put Trisha's boss on the phone?

1204
01:00:20,960 --> 01:00:22,400
He needs to appreciate something.

1205
01:00:22,400 --> 01:00:24,800
Listen, you're a grade A bitch

1206
01:00:24,800 --> 01:00:26,960
and my wife hates your guts.

1207
01:00:26,960 --> 01:00:29,760
But I took that hate from you,

1208
01:00:29,760 --> 01:00:33,600
put it on myself and now I would love a foot rub.

1209
01:00:33,600 --> 01:00:35,120
Hey, I'm going to Tucson next week.

1210
01:00:35,120 --> 01:00:36,400
Can I get a ride to the airport?

1211
01:00:36,400 --> 01:00:37,360
That's all I'm asking.

1212
01:00:38,160 --> 01:00:39,360
It's not asking a lot.

1213
01:00:39,360 --> 01:00:40,400
Wow, she wasn't lying.

1214
01:00:40,400 --> 01:00:41,280
You are a bitch.

1215
01:00:43,200 --> 01:00:44,640
Can I have $7 then, please?

1216
01:00:44,640 --> 01:00:45,520
I just want $7.

1217
01:00:46,640 --> 01:00:46,880
My relationship-

1218
01:00:46,880 --> 01:00:48,240
I'm also gonna need to move in with you

1219
01:00:48,240 --> 01:00:49,120
because she kicked me out.

1220
01:00:49,120 --> 01:00:51,760
My relationship is permanently negatively impacted.

1221
01:00:51,760 --> 01:00:53,440
All I need is one to the airport.

1222
01:00:54,320 --> 01:00:56,000
I need $10 a month.

1223
01:00:56,000 --> 01:00:56,640
Just, that's it.

1224
01:00:56,640 --> 01:00:57,840
That's not asking so much.

1225
01:00:57,840 --> 01:01:01,520
And in exchange, I'll give you some earbuds that I have.

1226
01:01:01,520 --> 01:01:02,880
They have a rocket ship on them.

1227
01:01:03,680 --> 01:01:05,040
You know, that's not asking a lot.

1228
01:01:05,040 --> 01:01:06,560
Listen, I need $20 a month.

1229
01:01:07,360 --> 01:01:08,400
If you give me $20 a month,

1230
01:01:08,400 --> 01:01:11,520
and this is probably overstepping our bounds,

1231
01:01:11,520 --> 01:01:14,720
but I'll give you some sex lube in a box.

1232
01:01:14,720 --> 01:01:17,120
To be fair, if you're not cool with sex lube in a box,

1233
01:01:17,120 --> 01:01:18,480
I can also give you a t-shirt.

1234
01:01:18,480 --> 01:01:20,400
Yes, there's a substitute program.

1235
01:01:21,760 --> 01:01:23,920
Are people, do you think people understand what we're doing?

1236
01:01:23,920 --> 01:01:25,600
No, it's covert.

1237
01:01:25,600 --> 01:01:26,400
It's subliminal.

1238
01:01:26,400 --> 01:01:27,360
It's superliminal.

1239
01:01:29,360 --> 01:01:31,920
Maximum Fun Drive is here, of course, friends.

1240
01:01:32,960 --> 01:01:36,560
And we so appreciate your support.

1241
01:01:36,560 --> 01:01:38,800
We appreciate ExtremeRestraints.com

1242
01:01:38,800 --> 01:01:44,000
for their generous gift to help us make this drive the,

1243
01:01:44,800 --> 01:01:48,400
well, the weirdest of any drive going on right now.

1244
01:01:48,400 --> 01:01:50,960
Let's talk about the upper echelons.

1245
01:01:50,960 --> 01:01:54,080
Let's talk about the premium rush.

1246
01:01:55,440 --> 01:01:58,960
I saw that movie, such great bike stunts,

1247
01:01:58,960 --> 01:02:01,120
such great acting from Mr. Gordon Levitt.

1248
01:02:02,560 --> 01:02:04,400
Now, you do remember that we set that up

1249
01:02:04,400 --> 01:02:06,640
as a euphemism for being a douche, right?

1250
01:02:06,640 --> 01:02:08,320
Yep, I do remember that.

1251
01:02:09,760 --> 01:02:13,680
So there are tears, premium tears,

1252
01:02:14,720 --> 01:02:18,080
which is what I cried after I watched Maximum Rush.

1253
01:02:18,080 --> 01:02:21,200
Justin, tell us, tell us what people are gonna get.

1254
01:02:21,200 --> 01:02:22,560
So we talked about 10, 20, 35.

1255
01:02:22,560 --> 01:02:25,280
If you give us $100 a month,

1256
01:02:25,280 --> 01:02:27,520
you're gonna be one of Jesse's Golden Eagles.

1257
01:02:27,520 --> 01:02:29,760
You're gonna get, join the Inner Circle,

1258
01:02:29,760 --> 01:02:31,600
which is a monthly club celebrating the best

1259
01:02:31,600 --> 01:02:32,960
in comedy, music, and culture.

1260
01:02:33,600 --> 01:02:37,440
Hosts of the Max Fun programs will pick a favorite book,

1261
01:02:37,440 --> 01:02:39,680
movie, album, something else cool,

1262
01:02:39,680 --> 01:02:41,280
and you're just gonna get it

1263
01:02:41,280 --> 01:02:43,840
with a note about why you'll like it.

1264
01:02:44,880 --> 01:02:46,800
You're also gonna get a free ticket

1265
01:02:46,800 --> 01:02:49,280
and you're also gonna get the Rocks Glasses,

1266
01:02:49,280 --> 01:02:51,360
the Intimate Sensations Pack, Max Fun earbuds,

1267
01:02:51,920 --> 01:02:55,680
and you're gonna be invited to the Max Fun Dinner in LA,

1268
01:02:55,680 --> 01:03:00,720
which is before Max Fun Con, and we'll be there.

1269
01:03:00,720 --> 01:03:02,000
Have a very special night.

1270
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:04,960
I went last year and hung out with Chuck Bryant

1271
01:03:05,680 --> 01:03:09,360
and John Hodgman and the guys from RiffTrax,

1272
01:03:09,360 --> 01:03:11,840
but I also got to hang out with Dimitri Pertnoy,

1273
01:03:11,840 --> 01:03:14,400
who is an awesome listener and a really cool guy.

1274
01:03:14,400 --> 01:03:15,760
Really looking forward to hanging out with him

1275
01:03:15,760 --> 01:03:16,880
at Max Fun Con again.

1276
01:03:16,880 --> 01:03:17,920
See, you could be that guy.

1277
01:03:17,920 --> 01:03:20,000
He's a really awesome guy, yes.

1278
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:23,200
Two years, a year before that, Justin and I went

1279
01:03:23,200 --> 01:03:26,080
and got, Justin embarrassed me in front of John Hodgman.

1280
01:03:26,080 --> 01:03:27,360
In the worst way possible.

1281
01:03:27,360 --> 01:03:29,280
I still have a picture of it, if you ever wanna see it.

1282
01:03:29,280 --> 01:03:31,120
If you ever wanna see, maybe we can put that picture up.

1283
01:03:31,120 --> 01:03:33,200
It's like a special thing in the forums

1284
01:03:33,200 --> 01:03:34,640
of when Justin made me the angriest

1285
01:03:34,640 --> 01:03:35,600
I've ever been at Justin.

1286
01:03:36,640 --> 01:03:37,680
It was a special moment.

1287
01:03:37,680 --> 01:03:38,720
It was not a special moment.

1288
01:03:38,720 --> 01:03:40,640
It was the angriest I've ever, ever been.

1289
01:03:40,640 --> 01:03:41,680
At anyone, probably.

1290
01:03:42,400 --> 01:03:44,080
Well, we're past it now.

1291
01:03:44,080 --> 01:03:44,800
Are we?

1292
01:03:44,800 --> 01:03:48,000
For $200 a month, you can join Jordan's Platinum Angels.

1293
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:50,400
You get all the shit that we've talked about so far, right?

1294
01:03:50,400 --> 01:03:52,400
You also get free registration

1295
01:03:52,400 --> 01:03:54,480
for the Atlantic Ocean Comedy and Music Festival

1296
01:03:54,480 --> 01:03:56,000
for boatparty.biz.

1297
01:03:56,000 --> 01:03:56,960
What is that, you ask?

1298
01:03:57,520 --> 01:03:58,720
You stupid idiot.

1299
01:03:59,920 --> 01:04:01,600
How do you not know about this already?

1300
01:04:02,240 --> 01:04:03,120
It's a cruise.

1301
01:04:04,240 --> 01:04:05,680
It's a comedy cruise.

1302
01:04:05,680 --> 01:04:08,800
You get on a ship from September 13th to 16th.

1303
01:04:08,800 --> 01:04:11,760
You get on a ship and you get to do and experience comedy

1304
01:04:11,760 --> 01:04:14,000
with people like Maria Bamford and Chuck Bryant

1305
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:16,560
and Dan Deacon and John Hodgman and Josie Long

1306
01:04:17,120 --> 01:04:19,120
and Al Magigal and Eugene Merman

1307
01:04:19,120 --> 01:04:21,520
and Marc Maron or Marc Maron.

1308
01:04:22,560 --> 01:04:23,760
John Roderickson in the mix.

1309
01:04:23,760 --> 01:04:25,360
I think it's Marc Mariner.

1310
01:04:25,360 --> 01:04:26,800
Marc Mariner's in there.

1311
01:04:26,800 --> 01:04:27,280
Yeah, sure.

1312
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:29,440
It's a maritime law that Marc Maron-

1313
01:04:29,440 --> 01:04:30,560
His son's Submariner.

1314
01:04:32,240 --> 01:04:33,920
Kristen Schaal is gonna be there.

1315
01:04:34,800 --> 01:04:35,040
Fuck.

1316
01:04:35,840 --> 01:04:37,120
Fuck, why aren't we going to this?

1317
01:04:37,760 --> 01:04:38,800
It's so dope.

1318
01:04:38,800 --> 01:04:41,600
It's so good and we can't go because we're not allowed.

1319
01:04:42,880 --> 01:04:43,680
We're not allowed on the internet.

1320
01:04:43,680 --> 01:04:45,680
We're not allowed to go to anything, ever.

1321
01:04:45,680 --> 01:04:48,560
Justin and Travis and I, before we were podcasters,

1322
01:04:50,400 --> 01:04:52,320
we were whale molesters.

1323
01:04:54,800 --> 01:04:56,960
You let us anywhere within-

1324
01:04:56,960 --> 01:04:58,800
I'm only laughing because I feel so guilty.

1325
01:04:59,360 --> 01:05:02,080
We would get 10,000 lees under the sea

1326
01:05:02,080 --> 01:05:04,480
and then we would get one leek inside a whale

1327
01:05:04,480 --> 01:05:04,880
and it would-

1328
01:05:05,600 --> 01:05:06,960
Guys, no shit.

1329
01:05:07,600 --> 01:05:08,960
It's the best feeling in the world.

1330
01:05:10,560 --> 01:05:11,600
But we're not allowed to do it anymore.

1331
01:05:11,600 --> 01:05:12,800
And the shame you feel afterwards.

1332
01:05:12,800 --> 01:05:15,200
The shame you feel afterwards is the most pungent shame

1333
01:05:15,200 --> 01:05:16,160
you'll ever experience.

1334
01:05:16,160 --> 01:05:16,800
But when you're-

1335
01:05:17,920 --> 01:05:18,480
When you're-

1336
01:05:18,480 --> 01:05:19,600
Oh my God.

1337
01:05:19,600 --> 01:05:22,560
Sometimes I read the parable of Jonah and the whale

1338
01:05:22,560 --> 01:05:24,720
and it's like, I just can't control myself.

1339
01:05:24,720 --> 01:05:29,920
I watch Pinocchio and I'm like, ow, Pieschio is more like it.

1340
01:05:31,680 --> 01:05:36,480
I think I get on the forums and I read my Monstro slash fic.

1341
01:05:36,480 --> 01:05:38,400
Monstro is the whale from Pinocchio.

1342
01:05:38,400 --> 01:05:41,600
And I just can't help it.

1343
01:05:41,600 --> 01:05:45,120
I get my rocket lube and I spend two and a half hours

1344
01:05:45,120 --> 01:05:46,240
right there on the web.

1345
01:05:48,240 --> 01:05:51,760
Just reading it and keeping my hands moisturized with the lube

1346
01:05:51,760 --> 01:05:53,360
so that my knuckles don't get all cracky.

1347
01:05:53,360 --> 01:05:55,280
I get- It's very dry in my office.

1348
01:05:55,280 --> 01:05:56,320
Also, I masturbate.

1349
01:05:59,120 --> 01:06:01,280
Maximumfun.org first slash donate.

1350
01:06:01,920 --> 01:06:03,280
And then you can just donate.

1351
01:06:03,840 --> 01:06:07,200
If you donate, I will never talk about that shit

1352
01:06:07,200 --> 01:06:08,800
I just talked about ever again.

1353
01:06:08,800 --> 01:06:09,840
That's a guarantee.

1354
01:06:09,840 --> 01:06:10,240
It's not.

1355
01:06:10,240 --> 01:06:12,480
And it is also important that when you donate,

1356
01:06:12,480 --> 01:06:15,200
that you post on Twitter or Facebook or something

1357
01:06:15,200 --> 01:06:18,240
and say, hey, friends that haven't donated to the Max Fun Drive,

1358
01:06:18,240 --> 01:06:20,880
you freeloaders, get in gear.

1359
01:06:20,880 --> 01:06:22,960
There's only like four or five or six days left.

1360
01:06:22,960 --> 01:06:23,920
I can't count.

1361
01:06:23,920 --> 01:06:26,240
But it's time to get out there and support Max Fun Drive.

1362
01:06:26,240 --> 01:06:27,200
I know you listen.

1363
01:06:27,840 --> 01:06:28,720
I know you do.

1364
01:06:28,720 --> 01:06:31,120
I know you do, joke thieves.

1365
01:06:32,400 --> 01:06:33,520
Seriously, thank you guys.

1366
01:06:33,520 --> 01:06:36,560
Thank you guys so, so much for your support.

1367
01:06:36,560 --> 01:06:38,960
It really does mean so much to me.

1368
01:06:38,960 --> 01:06:41,360
I don't have the words to express my gratitude,

1369
01:06:41,360 --> 01:06:42,400
my love, my affection.

1370
01:06:43,040 --> 01:06:43,760
But it's there.

1371
01:06:43,760 --> 01:06:44,800
You got to trust it.

1372
01:06:44,800 --> 01:06:49,920
I love you guys as much as I love getting bones deep in a whale.

1373
01:06:50,480 --> 01:06:51,680
Do you guys want a Yahoo?

1374
01:06:51,680 --> 01:06:53,360
This Yahoo answer was sent in by Jacob Locker.

1375
01:06:53,360 --> 01:06:53,920
Thank you, Jacob.

1376
01:06:53,920 --> 01:06:57,600
It's by Yahoo Answers user magicmissile1 who asks,

1377
01:06:58,400 --> 01:07:00,080
what if Sonic the Hedgehog was real?

1378
01:07:01,120 --> 01:07:01,680
Whoa.

1379
01:07:01,680 --> 01:07:03,360
If he was real and alive in our world.

1380
01:07:04,400 --> 01:07:05,520
Well, the end.

1381
01:07:05,520 --> 01:07:05,920
That's it.

1382
01:07:05,920 --> 01:07:06,640
That's all it is.

1383
01:07:07,440 --> 01:07:08,080
He- Okay.

1384
01:07:08,080 --> 01:07:08,720
Okay.

1385
01:07:08,720 --> 01:07:11,120
Are we talking about Sonic, video game Sonic,

1386
01:07:11,120 --> 01:07:14,640
or Sonic Jaleel White voiced Sonic from the Sonic cartoon?

1387
01:07:14,640 --> 01:07:15,760
Good question.

1388
01:07:15,760 --> 01:07:18,640
If you fucking are capable of playing a Sonic game now

1389
01:07:18,640 --> 01:07:20,400
and not hearing Jaleel White's voice,

1390
01:07:20,400 --> 01:07:21,680
you're out of your mind.

1391
01:07:21,680 --> 01:07:22,400
Yeah.

1392
01:07:22,400 --> 01:07:25,680
Because I feel like that Sonic could be reasoned with.

1393
01:07:25,680 --> 01:07:28,240
I feel like if Sonic the Hedgehog was real,

1394
01:07:28,240 --> 01:07:30,000
but it was one from the video game,

1395
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:32,560
it's basically you just have like a blue rat

1396
01:07:32,560 --> 01:07:34,000
looking for shiny keys in your home.

1397
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:36,560
That's my important question here is,

1398
01:07:36,560 --> 01:07:39,600
is he real in the real world looking like Sonic

1399
01:07:39,600 --> 01:07:40,560
from the video game?

1400
01:07:40,560 --> 01:07:42,080
Or is he real in the real world

1401
01:07:42,080 --> 01:07:43,760
and he's just a really fast hedgehog?

1402
01:07:43,760 --> 01:07:44,480
Can you reason?

1403
01:07:45,200 --> 01:07:49,040
Does he have the faculties for reason?

1404
01:07:49,040 --> 01:07:50,800
Because my guess would be dissection.

1405
01:07:51,440 --> 01:07:52,000
Right.

1406
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:52,880
Why?

1407
01:07:52,880 --> 01:07:55,200
Because everybody wants to know why he's so fast.

1408
01:07:55,200 --> 01:07:55,440
Yeah.

1409
01:07:55,440 --> 01:07:56,880
Well, I mean, if you capture Bigfoot,

1410
01:07:56,880 --> 01:07:58,960
they wouldn't just be like, go on about your business.

1411
01:07:58,960 --> 01:08:01,200
Nobody's seen Jaleel White in 15 years.

1412
01:08:01,920 --> 01:08:04,400
And maybe he's inside Sonic the Hedgehog.

1413
01:08:04,400 --> 01:08:07,040
We all talk about capturing Bigfoot,

1414
01:08:07,040 --> 01:08:09,920
but wouldn't we know what to do with him when we got him though?

1415
01:08:09,920 --> 01:08:11,360
You think so much about the chase.

1416
01:08:11,360 --> 01:08:12,960
You never think about the end game.

1417
01:08:12,960 --> 01:08:16,320
You probably just, you try to recreate Harry and the Hendersons

1418
01:08:16,320 --> 01:08:19,600
and he would not be, he would not be down with that.

1419
01:08:19,600 --> 01:08:22,880
I feel like he would probably just want to maul you.

1420
01:08:22,880 --> 01:08:24,240
How big is Sonic the Hedgehog?

1421
01:08:24,240 --> 01:08:26,080
Is he the size of a regular hedgehog?

1422
01:08:26,080 --> 01:08:28,320
Because that's like, that would be kind of,

1423
01:08:29,680 --> 01:08:30,400
okay, what's worse?

1424
01:08:30,400 --> 01:08:32,160
Sonic the Hedgehog is real and he's small

1425
01:08:32,160 --> 01:08:33,360
like a regular hedgehog.

1426
01:08:33,360 --> 01:08:36,000
And so you never find him or he's the size of a human,

1427
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:37,360
which is the scariest.

1428
01:08:37,360 --> 01:08:38,160
Oh my God.

1429
01:08:38,160 --> 01:08:40,000
You open your door and he's like,

1430
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:42,960
I was hoping you could give me some milk.

1431
01:08:42,960 --> 01:08:45,120
And Sonic, you get out of here,

1432
01:08:45,120 --> 01:08:47,760
you weird two and a half foot tall hedgehog.

1433
01:08:47,760 --> 01:08:49,200
I hate your guts.

1434
01:08:49,200 --> 01:08:51,200
But what if he's fucking eye level and he's like-

1435
01:08:51,200 --> 01:08:52,880
Does he not sound like Jaleel White?

1436
01:08:52,880 --> 01:08:55,280
That was Justin's Jaleel White impression.

1437
01:08:55,280 --> 01:08:56,880
That's right, Jaleel White.

1438
01:08:56,880 --> 01:09:00,480
Justin and Jaleel White is a matchstick girl.

1439
01:09:00,480 --> 01:09:01,520
Did I do that?

1440
01:09:01,520 --> 01:09:02,960
Did I do that?

1441
01:09:02,960 --> 01:09:04,720
I'm back with like some plates.

1442
01:09:04,720 --> 01:09:06,960
Could you put and have a cheese?

1443
01:09:10,800 --> 01:09:12,800
Please place a cheese for me.

1444
01:09:14,880 --> 01:09:16,800
You got any chili dogs?

1445
01:09:17,440 --> 01:09:19,840
It's like a tiny ghostly Peebo Bryson.

1446
01:09:24,800 --> 01:09:26,320
And Stefan comes out and he's like,

1447
01:09:26,320 --> 01:09:28,480
hello, I'm Stefan.

1448
01:09:28,480 --> 01:09:30,000
My voice is a little deeper.

1449
01:09:30,800 --> 01:09:31,440
Come on, fuck.

1450
01:09:31,440 --> 01:09:34,080
I'm still very upsetting.

1451
01:09:34,080 --> 01:09:35,520
Do you love me?

1452
01:09:35,520 --> 01:09:40,720
If he was real, I think he would find a very hollow-

1453
01:09:40,720 --> 01:09:45,760
He comes from a reality where his entire world is built around

1454
01:09:46,320 --> 01:09:48,400
not just his height, but his abilities.

1455
01:09:49,120 --> 01:09:52,480
There was an architect at some point in Green Hill Zone

1456
01:09:52,480 --> 01:09:54,480
who's like, I don't know, a loop here?

1457
01:09:54,480 --> 01:09:57,200
And no one questioned the practicality of that.

1458
01:09:57,200 --> 01:10:00,080
Maybe one day someone will be able to use this fucking thing.

1459
01:10:00,080 --> 01:10:04,560
Because that's our only method of egress from our home,

1460
01:10:04,560 --> 01:10:07,120
is that we have to run really fast to the loop

1461
01:10:07,120 --> 01:10:08,640
and get out that way.

1462
01:10:08,640 --> 01:10:10,160
And I also think I'm going to follow that up

1463
01:10:10,160 --> 01:10:11,760
with a pit with some spikes in it.

1464
01:10:11,760 --> 01:10:14,000
Whoa, why would you do that?

1465
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:16,000
So if people fall down, they die.

1466
01:10:16,000 --> 01:10:18,400
Yeah, we're just building like a hillside here.

1467
01:10:18,400 --> 01:10:20,320
Why are you- I want them to die.

1468
01:10:20,320 --> 01:10:22,640
Why would you put spikes anywhere?

1469
01:10:22,640 --> 01:10:22,960
Sure.

1470
01:10:22,960 --> 01:10:23,200
Right?

1471
01:10:23,200 --> 01:10:24,880
Unless you're defending a castle.

1472
01:10:24,880 --> 01:10:27,360
Like I see no use for spikes.

1473
01:10:27,360 --> 01:10:31,200
I think Sonic the Hedgehog would find this to be a miserable existence

1474
01:10:32,480 --> 01:10:36,080
because there would be a cabal of,

1475
01:10:37,360 --> 01:10:39,600
I'll say a certain kind of internet user,

1476
01:10:40,640 --> 01:10:46,640
a certain kind of author of a certain type of fiction

1477
01:10:47,600 --> 01:10:51,440
that would hunt him down and fuck him to death.

1478
01:10:51,440 --> 01:10:58,480
And now I'm imagining Julia White's screams of protest.

1479
01:11:00,080 --> 01:11:00,800
Not again.

1480
01:11:01,920 --> 01:11:02,800
Julia dogs.

1481
01:11:05,040 --> 01:11:06,320
That one wasn't very good.

1482
01:11:06,320 --> 01:11:08,640
Are we just now discovering that Justin does horrible,

1483
01:11:08,640 --> 01:11:10,160
horrible impressions of Julia White?

1484
01:11:11,280 --> 01:11:13,200
Replace Julia White with everybody

1485
01:11:13,200 --> 01:11:16,480
and I think that you are pretty much got my whole thing.

1486
01:11:16,480 --> 01:11:17,680
That's my whole situation.

1487
01:11:17,680 --> 01:11:20,240
What if one of the scientists that captured him

1488
01:11:20,240 --> 01:11:22,480
were the same people riding the-

1489
01:11:22,480 --> 01:11:23,600
Oh, Jesus.

1490
01:11:23,600 --> 01:11:25,200
Oh, can you imagine that?

1491
01:11:25,200 --> 01:11:27,280
We will continue to study him throughout the night.

1492
01:11:27,280 --> 01:11:29,120
You all can leave and I will keep an eye on him.

1493
01:11:29,840 --> 01:11:32,320
Hey, Dave, can you keep an eye on Sonic?

1494
01:11:32,320 --> 01:11:35,360
We're all gonna leave and shut off the security cameras

1495
01:11:35,360 --> 01:11:38,640
to save electricity, so just don't do anything.

1496
01:11:38,640 --> 01:11:40,000
Hey, happy birthday, buddy.

1497
01:11:40,000 --> 01:11:40,800
Happy birthday.

1498
01:11:42,800 --> 01:11:44,400
If you look in the closet,

1499
01:11:44,400 --> 01:11:46,080
we've switched out one of the hazmat suits

1500
01:11:46,080 --> 01:11:48,400
for a tail suit. Go wild.

1501
01:11:48,400 --> 01:11:50,400
We know you've been lonely since the divorce.

1502
01:11:50,400 --> 01:11:52,000
Just really go wild.

1503
01:11:52,000 --> 01:11:54,800
Hey guys, what's going on?

1504
01:11:54,800 --> 01:11:56,640
Do I smell chili sauce?

1505
01:11:56,640 --> 01:11:57,440
You do.

1506
01:11:57,440 --> 01:11:59,920
It's not, I want you people listening at home to know

1507
01:11:59,920 --> 01:12:00,880
who might be worried about it.

1508
01:12:00,880 --> 01:12:01,920
It's consensual.

1509
01:12:01,920 --> 01:12:03,280
It is consensual.

1510
01:12:03,280 --> 01:12:04,720
Like this is not, we're not joking about it.

1511
01:12:04,720 --> 01:12:07,760
I think it would take some negotiation though.

1512
01:12:08,320 --> 01:12:08,800
Yeah.

1513
01:12:08,800 --> 01:12:09,280
I think it would take-

1514
01:12:09,280 --> 01:12:11,520
No, you show that fucker one gold ring,

1515
01:12:11,520 --> 01:12:13,600
like every woman, and he's down the fuck.

1516
01:12:13,600 --> 01:12:14,640
Oh, no.

1517
01:12:14,640 --> 01:12:16,880
And he's down the fuck, what?

1518
01:12:16,880 --> 01:12:17,840
Jesus.

1519
01:12:17,840 --> 01:12:20,800
Girlfriend, are you gonna take out that joke I said?

1520
01:12:20,800 --> 01:12:22,800
Cause I feel like I could do that joke better.

1521
01:12:22,800 --> 01:12:23,280
Yeah, okay.

1522
01:12:24,400 --> 01:12:25,360
Let me try it again.

1523
01:12:26,480 --> 01:12:27,600
I think it would be consensual.

1524
01:12:28,800 --> 01:12:31,360
Yeah, it would be, come on, consensual.

1525
01:12:31,360 --> 01:12:35,280
You show that guy one gold ring and he's ready to marry you.

1526
01:12:35,280 --> 01:12:36,960
Like every woman ever.

1527
01:12:38,480 --> 01:12:40,480
Boom, got him again.

1528
01:12:40,480 --> 01:12:41,600
Sorry, women.

1529
01:12:41,600 --> 01:12:43,360
You had it too easy for too long.

1530
01:12:43,360 --> 01:12:44,720
You wanna try it a third time?

1531
01:12:44,720 --> 01:12:46,000
Yeah, why don't we try one more time?

1532
01:12:50,560 --> 01:12:51,760
Yeah, give me a cue line.

1533
01:12:55,600 --> 01:12:57,680
Man, I would just really fuck Sonic's face off.

1534
01:13:00,880 --> 01:13:03,840
His face is on the ground, like in the movie Face Off.

1535
01:13:03,840 --> 01:13:04,880
None of this is usable.

1536
01:13:06,640 --> 01:13:08,720
Here, let's try a fourth time.

1537
01:13:08,720 --> 01:13:09,360
Okay.

1538
01:13:09,360 --> 01:13:11,760
I would fuck Sonic's face off.

1539
01:13:11,760 --> 01:13:14,320
That's my new ringtone.

1540
01:13:18,800 --> 01:13:20,480
Please don't fuck my face off.

1541
01:13:23,920 --> 01:13:25,760
Real quick, guys, we're heading out.

1542
01:13:25,760 --> 01:13:27,200
We're gonna leave you now.

1543
01:13:27,200 --> 01:13:32,880
Those of you who are still listening, which I'm sure is a small fraction of those who

1544
01:13:32,880 --> 01:13:34,160
began this journey with us.

1545
01:13:34,160 --> 01:13:38,800
But one more time, I just really wanna encourage you to go to maximumfun.org forward slash

1546
01:13:38,800 --> 01:13:44,960
donate and give anything you can is really helpful to our network.

1547
01:13:45,920 --> 01:13:48,720
I know a lot of people have asked about making one-time donations.

1548
01:13:50,000 --> 01:13:54,000
If that's all you can do, that is, of course, that money still spends.

1549
01:13:54,000 --> 01:13:58,720
But monthly donations are really what help us to be sustainable as a network and help

1550
01:13:58,720 --> 01:14:00,320
us to budget a lot better.

1551
01:14:00,880 --> 01:14:04,880
And even if you feel like you can't do 10, there's a $5 a month level that still gets

1552
01:14:04,880 --> 01:14:07,120
you all the bonus content and everything.

1553
01:14:07,120 --> 01:14:08,960
That option is available to you.

1554
01:14:08,960 --> 01:14:12,000
So maximumfun.org forward slash donate.

1555
01:14:12,000 --> 01:14:16,000
Support the stuff you like, because that's the only way that the stuff you like keeps

1556
01:14:16,000 --> 01:14:17,360
getting created.

1557
01:14:18,480 --> 01:14:24,160
And we are so, so, so, so grateful to everybody who gives and thinks this show is worth their

1558
01:14:24,160 --> 01:14:24,720
money.

1559
01:14:24,720 --> 01:14:30,080
I feel like there's usually some resistance that we see on Twitter, because we only do

1560
01:14:30,080 --> 01:14:30,720
this once a year.

1561
01:14:30,720 --> 01:14:36,080
And so people who join in and haven't heard it before, I don't know, they are made uncomfortable

1562
01:14:36,080 --> 01:14:38,640
by the fact that we ask for money once a year.

1563
01:14:38,640 --> 01:14:39,920
I guess twice a year, two episodes.

1564
01:14:39,920 --> 01:14:42,000
But this year, I don't think I've seen any of that.

1565
01:14:42,000 --> 01:14:42,480
And that's-

1566
01:14:42,480 --> 01:14:43,760
No, everybody's been so cool.

1567
01:14:43,760 --> 01:14:45,360
Everybody's been so super fucking cool.

1568
01:14:45,360 --> 01:14:48,640
And you guys have no idea how huge that is to me.

1569
01:14:49,360 --> 01:14:50,160
It really does.

1570
01:14:50,160 --> 01:14:54,640
It makes me legit real world excited every time I see somebody tweet, like, so happy

1571
01:14:54,640 --> 01:14:56,080
to support NBNBA AM.

1572
01:14:56,960 --> 01:14:57,600
Thank you a lot.

1573
01:14:57,600 --> 01:14:58,640
Thank you, guys.

1574
01:14:58,640 --> 01:14:59,680
Thank you so much.

1575
01:14:59,680 --> 01:15:02,400
I want to thank John Roderick and The Long Winters for using our theme song, It's a

1576
01:15:02,400 --> 01:15:04,480
Departure, off the album, Putting the Days to Bed.

1577
01:15:04,480 --> 01:15:06,960
It'll be at fucking boat party.

1578
01:15:06,960 --> 01:15:07,680
I won't.

1579
01:15:07,680 --> 01:15:09,520
I'll be at my house, just thinking about it.

1580
01:15:10,160 --> 01:15:12,080
I'll be sitting in a bathtub with a toy boat.

1581
01:15:12,080 --> 01:15:12,880
Like, it's the same.

1582
01:15:13,840 --> 01:15:17,840
Thanks to everybody tweeting about the show, like Candace Pye, Ian Farrell, CL, Jessica

1583

1585
01:15:29,600 --> 01:15:31,120
Everybody, thank you so much.

1586
01:15:31,120 --> 01:15:32,880
We really appreciate you spreading the word.

1587
01:15:32,880 --> 01:15:33,680
Thank you, guys.

1588
01:15:33,680 --> 01:15:36,560
This final Yahoo was sent in by Rachel Nero, another friend of the family.

1589
01:15:36,560 --> 01:15:37,120
Thank you, Rachel.

1590
01:15:37,120 --> 01:15:44,960
It's by Yahoo Answers user Amanda Lynn Samples, who asks, can my husband use Activia, the

1591
01:15:44,960 --> 01:15:46,560
yogurt, or is it just for women?

1592
01:15:48,800 --> 01:15:49,840
I'm Justin McElroy.

1593
01:15:49,840 --> 01:15:50,880
I'm Travis McElroy.

1594
01:15:50,880 --> 01:15:52,080
I'm Griffin McElroy.

1595
01:15:52,080 --> 01:15:53,440
This has been my brother, my brother and me.

1596
01:15:53,440 --> 01:15:54,480
Kissed your dad.

1597
01:15:54,480 --> 01:16:04,080
Skullway on the lips.
