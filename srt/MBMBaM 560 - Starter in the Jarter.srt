1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,820
The McElroy brothers are not experts and their advice should never be followed

2
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:10,580
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it

3
00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:17,660
Also, this show isn't for kids which I mentioned only so the babies out there will know how cool they are for listening

4
00:00:17,660 --> 00:00:30,660
What's up, you cool, baby?

5
00:00:47,660 --> 00:00:49,660
It's better, it's better with you

6
00:00:53,980 --> 00:00:55,980
It's better, it's better with you

7
00:01:00,260 --> 00:01:02,260
It's better, it's better with you

8
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:15,580

Now it's fucking done I'm Griffin mackerel, you know, it looks like a

15
00:01:49,980 --> 00:01:51,860
busted sprocket

16
00:01:51,860 --> 00:01:56,780
Can't it's you know, there was a moment in time and it is past. This is my brother

17
00:01:56,780 --> 00:02:02,620
My brother means advice show where we help people would take your questions and turn them out to me like into wisdom

18
00:02:02,620 --> 00:02:09,140
We just wrapped up a maximum fun drive if you supported us. Thank you so much for your support

19
00:02:09,140 --> 00:02:10,580
It means the world

20
00:02:10,580 --> 00:02:16,900
What I love about the first post max fun drive episode is I feel like if any episodes are gonna turn you off like this

21
00:02:16,900 --> 00:02:22,420
Is it for me? It's those so now we're just talking to the fucking diehard. Oh, yeah

22
00:02:23,580 --> 00:02:29,340
We've shaken away the wheat and it's all chaff all the way down

23
00:02:30,780 --> 00:02:35,000
Chapas, we're the wheat and that audience is the chat. Oh

24
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:40,800
Oh junk. There's no way not this time. Remember who's hosting this show. That's me

25
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:47,560
With my co-hosts Griffin and Travis cool energy bad boys of radio. Yeah, it's awesome

26
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:51,440
we did a lot of hard work those last two weeks trying to and you sort of

27
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:55,000
Lean upon the kindness of our listenership to support us

28
00:02:55,920 --> 00:03:01,000
Fiducially speaking and then in the last three minutes, you've really opened it up and let a huge dude

29
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:05,080
There me fall right and Peterson ripping off the mass to find out that I was a real

30
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:07,640
creepazoid

31
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:14,720
Time nothing but disdain inside these rickety rickety bones. Hey guys. Sorry. I'm late to the recording

32
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:18,840
What did I miss so far? Like what energy are we bringing to the podcast this week?

33
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:21,440
Yeah, well

34
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:22,960
Tell me

35
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:31,400
Are we doing like enthusiasm and gratitude and that was last time now we heard on I'm on a juice cleanse of enthusiasm

36
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:35,080
I don't think I don't think juice cleanses are supposed to like

37
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:41,260
Make the decency come spraying out of your body. Yeah, I don't my friend. I'll think you've ever done a juice

38
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:45,280
It ain't a mood lifter. Yes, my friend. Yes

39
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:48,800
No that a juice cleanse isn't like to get all the juice out of your body, right?

40
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:53,320
I just couldn't visit like I gotta cleanse all this juice out of here. Yeah

41
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:59,080
That's what I call it every morning when I squeeze my oranges. Hey, let's talk about squeeze it or just for juice

42
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:06,160
Just talking about this the other day we I've had we had some

43
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:11,080
Some oranges from a recipe. I didn't end up making a sick mate stuff

44
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:15,600
Yeah, and I was like, I think I'm gonna treat my wife for Mother's Day

45
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:21,360
Yeah to a nice what's the thing with the champagne and the memosa a mimosa, right?

46
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:25,880
I'm like, oh my dear nothing, but the best for you fresh squeezed orange juice

47
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:32,160
Flash-forward, I got 60s motherfuckers littered in the counter. I'm up to maybe a half cup. Yeah

48
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:34,160
Where are we getting all this?

49
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:41,120
From people the return on investment the ROI of fresh squeezed orange juice is oh very low. It's ridiculous

50
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:47,260
I mean when you're using some kind of utensil Jamie, I was gonna be my question. Yeah, I mean I'm using a juicer

51
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:51,880
No, no, no listen guys

52
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:59,720
There's a reason God made our armpits perfectly orange shaped and it's because he wanted us to use that to perfectly

53
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:04,260
Just you plop of any any size orange really any size orange?

54
00:05:04,260 --> 00:05:08,400
It's perfectly a little baby clementine one of those little halo guys

55
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:12,880
or it's just a big you could grapefruit it even depending on your

56
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:16,920
Just the size of a boy. Here's the problem Griffin. I've tried that

57
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:19,520
Yeah, but when I do it and maybe there's something wrong with me

58
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:25,960
But when I do it my whole body concaves around the orange. I lifted my arm. The orange is still

59
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:32,240
Yeah, your armpit ate it like a pac-man did. Yeah, is that weird? It's not great

60
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:35,760
But I guess any way you can get vitamins in your system is good

61
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:40,680
According to what I'm doing here. I just throw the whole orange into a food processor

62
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:42,640
Okay

63
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:47,520
Grind it all up all of it. Yeah, the whole rind at all a rind at all

64
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:50,080
And then I just eat that with one raw egg

65
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:53,360
Hold one whole egg like a viper

66
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:56,280
Why can't you just cook the egg?

67
00:05:56,760 --> 00:06:02,560
Huh? I guess time I guess Rocky's really lazy or really busy. I suppose

68
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:05,560
The peel is like the bones of the orange. Wow

69
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:08,640
damn

70
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:14,780
No, no, no, no the peel is the bones of the orange I'm gonna hit you with this

71
00:06:14,780 --> 00:06:17,360
I'm it you're thinking it's the skin, right? Yeah

72
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:23,000
There's a lot of things in orange that could pass for skin and I don't feel like anything else even comes close to bone

73
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:28,000
But it's the outside the seeds are the bones, you know, it's exoskeletons, you know

74
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:35,000
It's seeds are the eyes that we have a whole fucking word for it. So rare. Yeah is the phenomena that it is

75
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:41,560
Identified as an exoskeleton, but it is common enough though. We do have nomenclature and it is exoskeleton

76
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:45,000
I have peeled up an orange from my lab to eat

77
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:52,160
And he I put it on his plate and he picked it up and he said what's this stuff in that tone of voice?

78
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:56,460
What's this stuff and he pointed at it and he pointed the sort of white?

79
00:06:56,460 --> 00:06:58,460
webbing

80
00:06:58,700 --> 00:07:04,620
The veins of it and he said what is this? This looks gross and I was like, oh, well, that's just the

81
00:07:05,980 --> 00:07:07,980
that's just the

82
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:14,540
That's just the I didn't know what to tell him inside skin the inside the it's not he was like

83
00:07:14,540 --> 00:07:17,820
Can I eat this and I was like, I don't know like I've been doing it my whole life

84
00:07:17,820 --> 00:07:21,860
And I don't know if you're supposed to do it or if I've been doing a bad job with it

85
00:07:21,860 --> 00:07:28,140
That stuff is kind of like the central nervous system of the orange if we're still breaking it down in comparison to the human body

86
00:07:28,420 --> 00:07:35,460
Yeah, the little the little strands that happen like as you break apart the the little segments, which are like the muscles

87
00:07:35,460 --> 00:07:39,860
Oh, yeah, it's like the central nervous system. That's how that's how the orange feels

88
00:07:40,660 --> 00:07:46,200
My I had a I had a I had a glass of grapefruit juice. Yeah, tell me more about fruit

89
00:07:46,860 --> 00:07:51,580
Let's keep talking about fruit juice. I had a glass of grapefruit juice. I got a bottle of this stuff

90
00:07:51,580 --> 00:07:54,180
Not ruby red. I'm talking about like original

91
00:07:54,780 --> 00:07:56,420
GJ. Oh

92
00:07:56,420 --> 00:08:04,060
She'll call it the bitter bad stuff that I was drinking for my health. Sure. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, my wife

93
00:08:05,420 --> 00:08:12,360
Who's a physician what I'm drinking? Yeah, I'm drinking this juice and she's like be careful cuz

94
00:08:13,460 --> 00:08:19,600
Grapefruit juice can mess with your antidepressants and I was thinking it about it. It's like

95
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:21,200
damn

96
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:23,200
grapefruit

97
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:28,440
It's not bad enough that you taste like you do I already feel not great

98
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:34,680
Then you're gonna get into my brain and fuck with my pills. Really you have to taste a bit better

99
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:39,680
Than you do. Yeah, you're gonna fuck with my brain shit. Yeah

100
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:43,480
Grapefruit someone that can also mess with birth control, right?

101
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:46,680
whatever

102
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:49,840
And nature is sending us all the signals that this is not for you

103
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:54,200
Don't do it. I think it's like sour patch kids

104
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,800
Destroyed the antidepressants and my bloodstream

105
00:08:57,800 --> 00:09:04,800
I would have to there would be a reckoning there that I would have it would take you some real soul-searching with grapefruit easy pass

106
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:13,920
No, thank you, I don't need this anymore. This is a good blend. I think if fried chicken canceled out my antidepressants

107
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:17,000
I think there would just be a day that I just call like Travis's sad day

108
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:20,760
Yeah, I get to eat a bunch of fried chicken. No, this is a thing, right?

109
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:26,280
At least that you'd be like, huh? It was pretty cool earlier when I was

110
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:33,480
This depressive episode right on the floor staring at the ceiling

111
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:37,480
What are what all means all I can think is like the back of my throat tastes like barf

112
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:43,720
From the terrible juice that I have and nothing is good. It's all bad all the way down

113
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:46,360
They don't give you much to hang your hat on with the great

114
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:49,800
Oh except for the girth of it the size of it. You could hang a hat on it

115
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:53,560
It's rare that there is a vegetable or fruit either one

116
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:59,600
Well, yeah free where nature said yeah, you can eat this but minus it just setting it on fire first

117
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:04,120
Perhaps if you set it on fire first, it would taste better. That's reserved for like meat

118
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:09,160
Yeah, that's reserved for like whole thing. Grapefruit is better when you set it on fire

119
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:14,560
Yeah, you toast a grapefruit take a little blowtorch to it. You put a little salt on there

120
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:20,200
We never listen to nature though. You look at a you look at that. So would you say that again? That sounded so

121
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:24,240
Nature the first time we saw a coconut. What's up?

122
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:29,720
This thing is hard as fuck and it's covered in hair and we're like, I think I'm gonna have me some

123
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:34,640
I'm gonna get in there. Somebody grab one of those hard nuts those hard hairy nuts off the ground

124
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:37,240
They're like, I'll drink this and the person with them was like, you'll

125
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:43,920
Yeah, I don't know whatever is in it

126
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:49,200
I'm gonna do it and then I'm gonna pretend like it's good for me and selling little cardboard bottles

127
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:53,320
Yeah, I've tried to drink every nut on this fucking island and it hasn't landed yet

128
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:58,300
I am gonna drink this with guys this huge everyone is gonna be the one I drink first was having a wild day

129
00:10:58,300 --> 00:11:02,840
They walked up to like a banana and they're like, I'll sing to this and did it and nothing

130
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:07,280
That wasn't it. I'll drink this nut. I'm argue with this potato

131
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:17,000
Not that either no, so this is an advice show. Yeah and vice stay away from fruit. Yep. Yeah, so

132
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:22,080
So thank but but thank you for joining us. Thank you for your support in the maximum fun drive

133
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:25,680
I'm sure it went swimmingly. We really do appreciate you

134
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:30,120
I feel bad anytime we even goof about not being grateful. We're so deeply grateful

135
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:33,500
we've done this so many times and y'all have been so supportive of us and

136
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:38,380
Just just but thank you. Thank you all and here's to another year of us

137
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:44,720
Just doing that good stuff that you crave like 12 minutes about how gross grapefruits are. It's not about

138
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:47,360
It's not that

139
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:54,960
Okay, they're also vindictive. I think that's what Justin say. Yeah, the grapefruit is both gross and punishing us for eating it

140
00:11:54,960 --> 00:12:01,760
Yeah, I just feel like and don't hey guys. I listen. I'm gonna cut you off right here. Delete the tweet taste this objective

141
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:05,960
I'm so glad you like grapefruit. That's wonderful. I'm happy to hear good for you

142
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:11,280
Please don't tweeted me about how grapefruit is good. I don't need you can tweet at Griffin. He doesn't check Twitter

143
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:13,520
Yeah, tell me all your fruit thoughts

144
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:21,320
Tell me all your thoughts on fruit a co-worker of mine recently expressed interest in trying sourdough recipes

145
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:26,760
So I said I would bring her some of my extra starter to use I put some starter in a really cute

146
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:30,840
Jarter and let her know that I put it in the break room fridge for her

147
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:34,840
She seemed really excited and she said she would take it home with her that day

148
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:39,360
But here's the thing. It's been a week and the jar of starter is still in the fridge

149
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:40,680
And here's the other thing

150
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:47,040
It's a really really cute jar the kind that is the perfect travel size for salad dressings and other condiments

151
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:52,360
I know the one this jar back do I awkwardly nudge my co-worker to use my starter?

152
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:57,640
So I so lovingly prepared or at what point can I take my sourdough and more importantly my jar back home?

153
00:12:57,640 --> 00:12:59,640
That's from sour in Southern, California

154
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:05,560
We made a sourdough starter in some home at class in like high school

155
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:08,680
I think maybe and they made us do that shit in a ziploc bag

156
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:16,720
Like we were making it like we were making prison sourdough. That's not this is an adorable jar

157
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:21,720
And the fact that it is not being utilized like this is a fucking crime

158
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:29,040
I'm angry sourdough. That's a living thing right there. Yes

159
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:33,040
And you brought a sourdough starters tribe. What's that for? Why?

160
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:41,760
What's the deal with the sourdough starter is what cultivates wild yeast so you can use that in your bread in place of like dried

161
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:49,680
yeast mm-hmm and because it is cultivated in such a way that it then will give the bread the flavor the sour flavor that we

162
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:51,240
associate with sourdough

163
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:54,320
And so each starter is different

164
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:59,160
Because you know it grows and changes over time as the yeast

165
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:05,120
Consumes the food and you keep feeding it and you take care of it like a pet

166
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:10,180
Right and this would be like if someone asked me to cut my dog in half so they could share some of my dog

167
00:14:10,180 --> 00:14:13,020
You know I did that and I brought half a dog into work

168
00:14:13,020 --> 00:14:17,880
And then they just left that half a dog there and didn't take it home to feed it and you put your dog half in

169
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:20,480
A really cute, you know box such a cute you

170
00:14:22,100 --> 00:14:25,180
Is it this person always plan to get the jar back

171
00:14:25,940 --> 00:14:32,800
100% or if this is a recent slight that has prompted the thought of like maybe they don't deserve the jar. Oh, this is good

172
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:40,380
yeah, I you know a good fixture this is just come come Friday five o'clock everybody's punching out and

173
00:14:40,380 --> 00:14:44,300
The jar is still there. I think you go grab that jar you unscrew the lid pop it off

174
00:14:44,460 --> 00:14:48,260
Go up to your co-worker take out their extended hands and just dump

175
00:14:48,780 --> 00:14:55,460
The gooey mess right into their open palms, and then you take the jar and say that you now we both got what we need

176
00:14:56,560 --> 00:15:01,500
What if what if 2021 maybe part of big dog run hmm?

177
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:03,380
Oh, what's that?

178
00:15:03,380 --> 00:15:06,400
Big dog run. Yeah, that's our year. That's our year Griffin

179
00:15:06,820 --> 00:15:08,140
perhaps the

180
00:15:08,140 --> 00:15:14,540
Part of big dog run right is when you have this impulse like I did this thing and they didn't do it

181
00:15:14,540 --> 00:15:20,320
Like like you're having now right? I brought it in. It's that there for a week. They didn't take it. Just take it home, right?

182
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:25,940
Yeah, they're not gonna ask about it. Hey, where was that sourdough starter that you put in the cute jar now?

183
00:15:25,940 --> 00:15:30,080
Let's sit there and die die on the vine for one whole entire week

184
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:32,960
It's taking up space in your mind

185
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:38,840
It's got like it's taking up a whole corner of your brain right now that it does not need to be taking up

186
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:44,720
Declutter your brain. Just do the damn thing and take your fucking cute jar back my friend

187
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:50,020
Yes, you have my full permission to do that. You have done nothing wrong

188
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:53,520
Except to care too much you care way too much

189
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:56,240
Is it possible that they don't know what a sourdough starter is?

190
00:15:56,240 --> 00:16:01,640
And so you say and you say I left you sourdough starter in the fridge and they said awesome and they raced to the fridge

191
00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:06,520
And they threw it open and they saw a few things in there. They saw well that yellow curvy friend is a banana

192
00:16:06,520 --> 00:16:12,200
I know him. Yeah, that is a sandwich which is bread adjacent

193
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:16,360
But that seems like us bread finisher and not a starter

194
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:21,440
we have what I'm I believe maybe a cup of miso soup and there is a

195
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:28,120
Half drinkin diet coca-cola. There's a jar with some sort of blob in it. That doesn't look particularly appetizing

196
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:33,320
So that can't possibly be it and a bay and a cold baby Ruth who freezes their baby Ruth

197
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:35,680
They see all this stuff. They don't know

198
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:40,440
They don't want to walk out with that with the the half can of diet coke and be like

199
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:45,800
Is this sourdough starter and seem like a real dipshit and be the office dipshit all of a sudden

200
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:50,480
You can't leave me hanging Griffin who did freeze their baby Ruth. Oh, it was Mike

201
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:52,480
it's nice my

202
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:58,040
Classic Mike ever since he got promoted a night manager. He thinks he can freeze whatever he wants

203
00:16:58,040 --> 00:17:00,320
Yeah, the weirdest part. It's half a baby Ruth

204
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:05,480
So it's like did he freeze it at some point and then well, you know, they put it back in the freezer. Sorry

205
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:11,680
No, he boils hot the other half and he squishes them together back to make one normal baby Ruth

206
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:13,840
No, and that's how he feels. Yeah

207
00:17:14,440 --> 00:17:16,440
Do you guys want a a?

208
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:18,480
Do you guys want a?

209
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:20,480
Quora. Oh

210
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:26,760
Sorry, what do you guys want a yahoo, but it's not from yahoo. It's from the website Quora

211
00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:31,240
I thought for a second you're about to ask if we wanted a Quibi. Do you guys?

212
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:37,040
I would actually I believe you would go down so fucking smooth right now, but no I'm gonna ask about do you want to?

213
00:17:37,560 --> 00:17:39,680
I'm I I'm out here on the edge

214
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:46,680
I'm just a man on the edge out in the rain asking his two brothers if they wanted a core you have been okay

215
00:17:46,680 --> 00:17:52,440
I know I take two people inside, you know what I'm gonna say. You've been in fucking skunk works are

216
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:59,560
Scenes for weeks. Yeah, you've had months to prepare

217
00:17:59,560 --> 00:18:05,100
Yeah, and you'd be like I'm still looking for the next big thing and what you come to us with is off-brand

218
00:18:05,100 --> 00:18:11,160
Yeah, and you didn't even rebrand your question like do you want a Quora?

219
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:14,600
Does it if that's not right, you know, that doesn't sound right

220
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:17,060
Do you want a dr. Pop?

221
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:32,980
Here's the thing about Quora, okay, let me tell you cuz this this this is in many ways better than the avatar. Yeah this

222
00:18:34,040 --> 00:18:35,680
this has

223
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:38,600
Opened my eyes this one particular Quora that was

224
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:43,840
Sent in to us. Hold on. I will get this this information who sent this in to us

225
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:49,920
I'm just gonna type in our gmail bar Quora urinal and that's from Nikki sent this in

226
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:51,920
Thank You Nikki for this flagship

227
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:53,960
Quora thing about Quora

228
00:18:53,960 --> 00:18:58,160
I didn't realize is that they called the Yahoo Answers website Yahoo Answers

229
00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:03,480
But very rarely were answers provided on Yahoo Answers. The question was the star of the show, right?

230
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:09,120
Here is a Quora I guess is what they I don't know if they call them Quora's or not

231
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:15,200
This is the question that was posted on Quora when you spit in the urinal and there's a string of saliva

232
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:18,140
Do the bacteria have time to go inside your mouth?

233
00:19:18,820 --> 00:19:25,820
So you read that and if that was Yahoo Answers the very next one would be first of all a wild 12 paragraph

234
00:19:26,120 --> 00:19:34,240
Screed about how electricity has the devil in it and that the only way to save yourself is to pray to some saint or whatever

235
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:41,440
Right, then the next one would be like shut up idiot. That's not how Quora does it how Quora does it is that they have

236
00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:46,640
Anoop Sinha who taught microbiology to medical undergrads for over 10 years

237
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:53,200
That's what his profile says and he provides an extensive answer and to me

238
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:57,340
That is the joy of Quora and I'd love to read some of it if I can

239
00:19:57,560 --> 00:19:58,560
Yes, sir

240
00:19:58,560 --> 00:20:01,880
To remind you the question is when you spit in the urinal and there's a string of saliva

241
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:04,880
Do the bacteria have time to go in your mouth? Anoop Sinha says?

242
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:11,080
Vibrio is one of the fastest bacteria around if not the fastest if you live if you see live Vibrio under a microscope

243
00:20:11,080 --> 00:20:16,580
They seem to dip around zip around like Barry Allen navigating through Central City and then there's a badass picture of the flash

244
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:19,120
So already we got micro

245
00:20:19,660 --> 00:20:26,680
Multimedia on this website. We've got all kinds of great stuff and how fast is this bacterium of 75 micrometers per second?

246
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:34,560
Is it fast or slow? That's pretty fast and the the McGraw-Hill encyclopedia of science and technology cites at 200

247
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:39,840
Micrometers per second. That's pretty fast. Yeah, and then it's an organism. That's barely two micrometers in length

248
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:45,920
That's incredible speed. That'd be like if we ran 75 to 200 meters per second or a 447 miles an hour

249
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:48,080
That's a fast little germ, huh?

250
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:52,080
Yeah, so Griffin, I had to ask where's the funny part?

251
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:56,760
Well, how quickly can this organism traverse through a string of saliva bridging your mouth in the urinal?

252
00:20:56,760 --> 00:20:59,720
Well, let's assume the length of the salivary bridge is 50 centimeters

253
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:04,680
That seems like a reasonable estimate considering the average heart height of the adult male and placement of the average urinal

254
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:06,040
I'm not being sexist here

255
00:21:06,040 --> 00:21:11,660
I just think it is logical to assume that urinals are mostly used by people who pee standing up and then there's a picture of a

256
00:21:11,660 --> 00:21:12,600
bridge

257
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:19,600
Okay, 50 centimeters is five hundred thousand micrometers. That's a long bridge and so to go

258
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:27,360
500,000 micrometers moving at 200 micrometers second that would take 2500 seconds. So if you stood still

259
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:30,240
With your spit dangling out of your mouth

260
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:32,640
into the urinal

261
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:37,320
I like hearing that all of these words so far for 42 uninterrupted minutes

262
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:44,320
That little nasty germ could maybe make it up there and you're but you would have to maintain the salivary bridge for 42 minutes

263
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:48,240
And the bacteria would have to move at top speed and I don't know how long Vibrio can keep it up

264
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:51,000
I the problem I the problem I have with this is like

265
00:21:51,320 --> 00:21:56,300
Even if you did it if I'm a bacteria and I see someone spit in the toilet

266
00:21:56,300 --> 00:22:00,480
I want to be like a you see a young buck who's like I'm going for it and

267
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:06,440
Every other bacteria is like I've seen so many dudes fucking try. You're never there's no way they're gonna

268
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:14,280
Maintain that salivary bridge no chance bud. I mean by the time you get to five minutes, which is definitely a world record

269
00:22:14,280 --> 00:22:18,680
I think that is the first moment where the bacteria would be like, you know what? I

270
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:24,920
Think we were all fucking good for this guys. This may be the one we've always wanted to try this stuff

271
00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:31,800
But it's too late just they'd have to go right away right it would have to be as soon as it tight like boom

272
00:22:32,680 --> 00:22:38,160
Yeah off off to the races. Yeah, the bacteria would have to be sort of poised on the edge of the urinal waiting for your

273
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:40,160
Pit your your not your piss

274
00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:45,120
Your spit. Hey, if I see you standing over urinal with a dangly dangle a spit hanging out of your mouth

275
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:50,560
Let's round it up to an hour. Let's round it up. Let's say an episode of television sans commercials

276
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:58,280
I'm gonna say to something to somebody I'll find a teacher or an adult and I will get them to I don't know put you

277
00:22:58,280 --> 00:23:03,780
In trouble somehow because you shouldn't be that you definitely shouldn't be doing that or or because at that point

278
00:23:03,780 --> 00:23:10,820
I think I might be impressed by the focus because I think you would see this that you'd walk in. Oh, hey, oh and

279
00:23:11,300 --> 00:23:17,180
Then there would be an amount of time that you would definitely be frozen in place watching this happen

280
00:23:17,300 --> 00:23:22,100
Mmm, right what where you think like I need to go tell some what is happening?

281
00:23:22,100 --> 00:23:25,500
I need to write something and I think in that time

282
00:23:26,380 --> 00:23:32,020
The curiosity would overtake you and you keep thinking well, I do want to go get someone

283
00:23:32,020 --> 00:23:39,940
But I also want to see how long they can dangle this big lugia spit into the urinal now

284
00:23:39,940 --> 00:23:44,740
This is getting a little gross. So I just want to say that there are also bad answers on here

285
00:23:44,740 --> 00:23:50,580
Like somebody saying good what bacteria under normal conditions human urine is sterile in a pinch

286
00:23:50,580 --> 00:23:55,060
You can even use it to clean a wound. So they're saying like there's no germs in a toilet in which case

287
00:23:56,100 --> 00:24:00,820
Stop fucking stop it. Of course there is I'm so sick of people saying that you can pee on a jellyfish sting

288
00:24:00,820 --> 00:24:04,980
So you may as well drink toilet water. Stop it. That's not what that means even a little bit at all

289
00:24:05,460 --> 00:24:07,460
somebody did question the

290
00:24:07,780 --> 00:24:09,780
Dr. Anup Sinha's

291
00:24:09,980 --> 00:24:16,060
Answer here and they did say wouldn't the bacteria have a shorter route going up your penis and then Chris Wilson who has nothing to do

292
00:24:16,060 --> 00:24:21,740
With anybody comes in and he's like it would have to overcome the speed of the stream and urine streams are not continuous

293
00:24:21,740 --> 00:24:24,580
If you were to watch it in slow motion, it's broken up into drops

294
00:24:24,580 --> 00:24:27,740
It would be like trying to run up a treadmill going the same speed as a fighter jet

295
00:24:27,740 --> 00:24:30,500
Not nearly as scientific. I could do that

296
00:24:31,060 --> 00:24:34,060
You could do that. First of all, you would have to keep this pee stream going

297
00:24:34,540 --> 00:24:36,540
for 42 minutes

298
00:24:39,820 --> 00:24:46,180
Do that I've been practicing I only pee once every four days. Yeah, it's wicked uncomfortable

299
00:24:46,180 --> 00:24:53,140
Don't get me wrong, but it's how I do it and I've been able to perfect it. It just comes out one set steady

300
00:24:53,140 --> 00:24:56,820
There's no arc to it. Yeah, it's like a lightsaber pretty

301
00:24:56,820 --> 00:24:58,300
wild

302
00:24:58,300 --> 00:25:01,700
Steady for 42 minutes. Yeah, that's a good way

303
00:25:02,540 --> 00:25:03,660
Yeah

304
00:25:03,660 --> 00:25:07,780
It doesn't save a lot of time. I've been keeping track of how much time I say

305
00:25:07,780 --> 00:25:14,660
I haven't figured out how to utilize it at all either. I don't know why I've been doing this. My doctor's really worried

306
00:25:15,300 --> 00:25:19,940
I'm just saying that's what Cora does. That's how Cora that's Cora

307
00:25:19,940 --> 00:25:24,120
And it's a little they have they have what we like to call a joke killer right at the beginning

308
00:25:24,120 --> 00:25:29,860
Where some fucking poindexter hop so up on your biz and is like actually I have a good answer

309
00:25:29,860 --> 00:25:35,060
But what's great is then you get a bunch of exactly like doofenshmirtz Justin. Yeah, that was wild

310
00:25:35,060 --> 00:25:37,060
You know, I had a doofenshmirtz

311
00:25:37,060 --> 00:25:42,460
I love those that then you get a bunch of hop-ons from people who get on the answer and they're like, hmm

312
00:25:42,460 --> 00:25:44,460
That's a really smart. Here's what I think

313
00:25:44,820 --> 00:25:48,740
Wouldn't you suck some of this biddle back up into your mouth and it's like stop it

314
00:25:48,740 --> 00:25:53,180
The good doctor heard already answered this one. You don't have to try and put some extra doctor juice on it

315
00:25:53,180 --> 00:25:56,520
Yeah, that boy Griffin Cora sounds a lot like Twitter

316
00:25:57,980 --> 00:25:59,980
How about a question yes

317
00:26:00,860 --> 00:26:05,340
My girlfriend recently tagged along while I went grocery shopping

318
00:26:06,780 --> 00:26:11,260
When we passed by the cheese aisle, she stopped surprised and said hold on a sec

319
00:26:11,860 --> 00:26:13,860
You're not gonna buy yourself any cheese. I

320
00:26:14,580 --> 00:26:20,020
Didn't really think of anything of it until my sister came to visit the next day and open my fridge to get a drink

321
00:26:20,020 --> 00:26:25,900
She laughed herself and said oh, I see you have a few cheese blocks in here. I know how much you love your cheese

322
00:26:26,500 --> 00:26:29,220
The thing is I do love cheese

323
00:26:29,620 --> 00:26:36,180
But I don't think I like it any more than the average person and I have no idea what I did to earn this reputation

324
00:26:36,940 --> 00:26:39,780
Brothers, how do I shake this and assert myself as an average?

325
00:26:40,260 --> 00:26:47,420
Cheese loving Joe that's from Elizabeth in Maryland Elizabeth. Let's first take one stop. Let's step back a little Elizabeth

326
00:26:47,420 --> 00:26:55,180
I want to talk about your sister. I think your sister opened the fridge and set out loud and I hope to God you are quoting

327
00:26:55,580 --> 00:26:58,660
Them like exactly or else it's liable. Oh

328
00:26:59,660 --> 00:27:04,900
I see you have a few cheese blocks in here. I know how much you love your cheese

329
00:27:04,900 --> 00:27:08,420
That's a real observation Elizabeth sister. It's a lot

330
00:27:09,060 --> 00:27:12,260
I would imagine that that was not quite the delivery

331
00:27:12,260 --> 00:27:17,460
I would think it would make a price out of a bit more human, but I for sure but like I think it would go like this

332
00:27:17,460 --> 00:27:19,460
Oh

333
00:27:20,020 --> 00:27:22,580
Little something like this. Oh

334
00:27:23,340 --> 00:27:29,460
I see you have a few cheese blocks in here. I know how much you love your cheese

335
00:27:30,500 --> 00:27:33,340
Yeah, that didn't sound more natural Shraff. I don't know

336
00:27:34,580 --> 00:27:38,700
From what Justin did but it was nearly identical to my ears. Here's the thing

337
00:27:38,700 --> 00:27:44,460
I'm starting to suspect just hearing Justin say it out loud and then me say it out loud in a better way that perhaps

338
00:27:45,020 --> 00:27:50,180
Your girlfriend and your sister have have been in contact with one another like hey

339
00:27:50,180 --> 00:27:52,180
Do we want to do a thing with cheese?

340
00:27:52,260 --> 00:27:56,060
Because I also don't know how I feel about your girlfriend saying hold on a sec

341
00:27:56,180 --> 00:28:03,420
You're not gonna buy yourself any cheese like like it's a special occasion that one might do on their birthday. You're not gonna have cake

342
00:28:03,420 --> 00:28:09,180
The only the only reason that somebody should be allowed to say that to you at a grocery store

343
00:28:09,940 --> 00:28:14,540
with a like shock in their voice should be if your name is dr. Cheese and

344
00:28:15,100 --> 00:28:20,340
You sell cheese on the internet that you buy at the grocery store, and it's a weird business

345
00:28:20,340 --> 00:28:22,340
It doesn't make any sense, but

346
00:28:22,340 --> 00:28:29,100
You're not getting cheap. I feel like if you have blocks of cheese in your fridge you like cheese more than the average bear

347
00:28:29,100 --> 00:28:32,300
Okay, that's all right. What do you base it?

348
00:28:32,300 --> 00:28:38,460
What are you basing that on that a normal a normal person doesn't have just blocks of blocks of cheese?

349
00:28:38,460 --> 00:28:39,660
I do

350
00:28:39,660 --> 00:28:42,820
Yeah, I do you have blocks of what do you do with them? I?

351
00:28:43,500 --> 00:28:48,300
Slice them off. I fucking eat them. Yeah different cheese for different moods. You know just

352
00:28:49,300 --> 00:28:55,560
No, no, no this issue Justin. You don't like raw cheese my wife can get nasty all she wants. I don't hold her back

353
00:28:55,560 --> 00:29:01,760
Okay, she's a strong beautiful bisexual woman. I let her live her own life, and if that includes eating cheese

354
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:08,560
Okay, then fucking God bless unmelted Justin doesn't hard you have to leave the room or yeah, I excuse myself

355
00:29:12,160 --> 00:29:17,780
Excuse myself to our rear home where there is the dairy which is a cheese-free yeah your panic room

356
00:29:17,780 --> 00:29:25,180
If yeah, that's another way of that's all sort of less extravagant way of putting it, but yes my cheese-free panic room

357
00:29:26,180 --> 00:29:31,780
Sometimes she you know what on my birthday. She goes to the panic room to eat the cheese. Wow that's not I appreciate that

358
00:29:31,780 --> 00:29:33,620
She lets me have free reign

359
00:29:33,620 --> 00:29:37,820
Yeah, you see her reach in the fridge and pull out a big block of gouda

360
00:29:37,820 --> 00:29:42,220
And you're like any chance you're about to melt those on some nachos nope. I'm out of here

361
00:29:42,860 --> 00:29:44,860
No, thank you. Bye

362
00:29:44,860 --> 00:29:46,860
I

363
00:29:47,380 --> 00:29:50,800
Let's uh let's take a quick break wait yeah

364
00:29:51,220 --> 00:29:56,460
Have we answered this to its fullest extent of the law I don't think there's an answer for I think we just say sorry that

365
00:29:56,460 --> 00:29:58,960
you were put in that position just sorry you know it's nice to have a

366
00:29:59,820 --> 00:30:02,800
Fucking you know there are worse things you could be

367
00:30:03,980 --> 00:30:07,940
Worse stuff and if you will know you love cheese it makes Christmas a lot easier

368
00:30:07,940 --> 00:30:12,220
Yeah, nothing like getting some boxes of room-temperature cheddar

369
00:30:12,220 --> 00:30:18,220
And I'm really sorry by the way if your friends and family are all huge my bim-bam heads, and they're gonna start calling you dr.

370
00:30:18,220 --> 00:30:19,180
cheese

371
00:30:19,180 --> 00:30:21,700
Yeah, that one's just too catchy

372
00:30:31,820 --> 00:30:38,860
Our first sponsor this week yeah, that's right sponsors are back, baby in a big way in a big way

373
00:30:38,860 --> 00:30:45,980
And the first one is bombas, which I this is so wild I'm wearing bombas right now get out

374
00:30:45,980 --> 00:30:48,700
Yep, yeah, I'm working out when I'm working out

375
00:30:49,420 --> 00:30:51,420
I slip on my bombas

376
00:30:51,780 --> 00:30:56,020
Sometimes I have a different pair just for working out. There's a bad the bad pair

377
00:30:56,020 --> 00:31:01,280
I don't like to wear those in public because I do some profane things in them vis-a-vis sweat

378
00:31:01,420 --> 00:31:05,940
But they always are so comfortable. They're stitched with this

379
00:31:05,940 --> 00:31:12,100
Moisture wicking yarn and they got vents that let the cool air in and prevent

380
00:31:12,500 --> 00:31:18,780
Overheating and there's a little pillow like tab to save you from blisters. They have stay up technology

381
00:31:18,780 --> 00:31:21,660
This is what it says here stay up. I know what they mean though

382
00:31:21,660 --> 00:31:28,460
It's like a nice perfect snug fit without being like restricted. Yeah, dude your foot can just kind of like live in these socks

383
00:31:28,460 --> 00:31:31,460
It's fantastic. There's like a bit of cushiony comfort on the bottom

384
00:31:31,460 --> 00:31:38,500
Oh, I wear them whenever I'm doing all my charity walk-a-thons that idea at least for a day. Yeah jump rope for heart

385
00:31:38,500 --> 00:31:40,020
Yeah, you know traps is in his bomb

386
00:31:40,020 --> 00:31:44,860
Yeah, my bomb is because otherwise my feet they'll get all blistery and uncomfortable and all those things

387
00:31:44,860 --> 00:31:47,640
But I'll wear my bomb us and it lets me do more

388
00:31:48,340 --> 00:31:51,340
charitable power walking sometimes it's a

389
00:31:52,180 --> 00:31:59,340
Triathlon and I'll do the power walking into a crab crawl and finish up with some skipping

390
00:31:59,340 --> 00:32:04,740
Don't give me Rhonda. I'll wear these guys in business. Absolutely. Oh, yeah. I mean they go day to evening for sure

391
00:32:07,900 --> 00:32:12,040
Yeah, I haven't experienced that for a very long time, but I do know that evening can become day

But also you could become friends with them like in first kid, but the question is that's the dream. That's the dream

400
00:32:49,560 --> 00:32:53,680
How would I even go about hiring someone for something like that?

401
00:32:54,360 --> 00:32:59,040

413
00:33:57,540 --> 00:34:01,980
But it ended up being a novelty erotic dancer who just based on drill bit Taylor. Oh

414
00:34:03,180 --> 00:34:05,180
Sexy how are they? Yeah

415

You

416
00:34:09,080 --> 00:34:11,080
We have wasted this world

417
00:34:11,720 --> 00:34:16,200
Our magic put a storm in the sky that has rendered the surface of our planet

418
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:17,720
uninhabitable

419
00:34:17,720 --> 00:34:22,560
But beneath the surface. Well, that's another story entirely

420
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,240
In a city built leagues below the apocalypse

421
00:34:27,120 --> 00:34:31,000
survivors of the storm forged paths through a strange new world

422
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:38,200
Some seek salvation for their homeland above others seek to chart the vast undersea expanse outside the city's walls

423
00:34:38,680 --> 00:34:41,480
And others still seek what else?

424
00:34:42,160 --> 00:34:43,900
fortune and glory

428
00:35:02,680 --> 00:35:09,480
I do you mean in that you've done it every episode for the last 50 some I need to sunset this but you can't say

431
00:35:18,440 --> 00:35:23,080
I want too much

432
00:35:25,880 --> 00:35:33,080
You could start doing it at different times in the podcast instead of right after I need this though because it helps me cut

433
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:37,420
You know what? I mean? This is like I can't puts me on its back and it helps me carry me through

434
00:35:37,980 --> 00:35:42,080
What do you want from me pilot? I just this isn't funny

435
00:35:42,080 --> 00:35:46,760
I don't want to let you know how desperate think things have gotten in this in the chicken sandwich whores

436
00:35:46,760 --> 00:35:49,840
I just want to update everybody the pilot

437
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:56,400
Flying J is getting into the fucking the gas station chain the gas

Including our newest southern and spicy chicken sandwiches make pilot Flying J the ultimate stop to fill up a great food

442
00:36:21,320 --> 00:36:28,680
Here's the reason you go to eat at a Flying J because you get off at an exit and the Wendy's says

443
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:30,800
0.5 miles and you're like, ah, fuck it

444
00:36:31,800 --> 00:36:36,900
That's too far. I'll probably get lost. I'm going to fly J. You're not lured in by menu item

445
00:36:36,900 --> 00:36:38,900
But that's not what we're here to talk about

446
00:36:39,880 --> 00:36:41,880
Pepsi has created peps place

447
00:36:41,880 --> 00:36:45,880
Wait fast better say that one. No, say it again. Say it again slower

00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:58,240
I need you to keep saying those three words over and over to me again until I fall asleep

PEP apostrophe EPS

455
00:37:29,800 --> 00:37:34,760
I just think it's fun. We talked about it on sawbones once the original name of Pepsi is

456
00:37:34,760 --> 00:37:43,400
is Brad's but I bet they're kicking themselves now because Brad's place is a better name. Yeah

457
00:37:44,040 --> 00:37:51,680
1890 yeah, if it was called Brad's drink still guys, so funny Brad's to me. I'm renaming it to Pepsi

Fridge which is also strong. This one is like among the more Orwellian

461
00:38:15,180 --> 00:38:22,580
Few things are more agreed upon than our collective unapologetic love of food cheesy juicy

462
00:38:22,580 --> 00:38:28,500
Here's different ways food could be taken from us Pepsi

Trust us. We know about foods. So it's um

00:38:33,460 --> 00:38:38,380
So many of our favorite eats are enhanced with pair with an ice-cold Pepsi Cola

So I won't so what you're saying is the process is I would get on pets place calm and pick Pepsi

Well that pairs gracefully with our crisp and tangy season chicken Caesar salad

Craving a tropical splash of Pepsi mango the fruity and floral notes complement the perfect blend of mild chilies

485
00:40:14,220 --> 00:40:18,620
Found in our buffalo wing sauce. Here's how you order first step one

486

Soda Pepsi so quiet. There's there's quiet

Curated from with mouth-watering food pairings from your cola choice, and then it lists food cheeseburgers buffalo wings Cajun chicken sandwiches

498
00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:10,920
You get the idea chicken sandwich wars raging on even at pep pep pep pep pep pep peps place

499
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:17,440
Then you fill out the meal with delectable sides including mac and cheese broccoli and Lay's chips

500
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:33,080
Oh, all right peps place will be opened every day for the next 30 days

501
00:41:33,080 --> 00:41:48,360
When's your restaurant open every day for the next 30 days

502
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:54,760
This is can I I rarely do this because I want I always want it to be a special surprise

503
00:41:54,760 --> 00:41:58,960
but I did load up the menu and I I do I

504
00:41:59,640 --> 00:42:01,640
am confused about

505
00:42:01,640 --> 00:42:05,000
If I do you have access to peps place and also no

506
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:09,720
There's one in El Paso, which I'm pretty sure the Pepsi would have gone quite flat by the time

507
00:42:09,720 --> 00:42:11,680
It reached my house from El Paso

508
00:42:11,680 --> 00:42:13,960
But like you can get

509
00:42:14,760 --> 00:42:20,560
Any it doesn't suggest a food. I they have six items and then they have

510
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:25,760
Nine Pepsi's and no matter which Pepsi you choose you can get one of the six

511
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:31,120
I want it to be restrictive like I want it to be like I would like the Pepsi mango zero sugar

512
00:42:31,120 --> 00:42:38,320
With the Louisiana style chicken sandwich and have the website be like no because those two don't go together

513
00:42:39,160 --> 00:42:42,760
You can't have that. I mean, I know it seems like a small complaint

514
00:42:42,760 --> 00:42:47,640
But like it is the entire point of the entire fucking thing. It's like if that doesn't right

515
00:42:50,320 --> 00:42:54,260
Now this press release didn't tell me about this but I

516
00:42:54,260 --> 00:43:00,580
Started thinking about it and like there is no way that Pepsi is springing up

517
00:43:01,940 --> 00:43:05,080
Like restaurants, right? No, because they're Pepsi

518
00:43:06,260 --> 00:43:09,220
Right. So I because you've it you've seen this

519
00:43:09,940 --> 00:43:13,940
Phenomenon and unlike all the the different food delivery apps

520
00:43:13,940 --> 00:43:18,000
I don't know if you guys have seen these all of a sudden a restaurant opens up and you're like

521
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:22,540
Well, I've never heard of this place and it's like well, that's because it's just yeah. Oh, yeah

522
00:43:22,540 --> 00:43:24,540
It's just chillies like a ghost restaurant

523
00:43:24,860 --> 00:43:29,820
Yeah, ghost restaurant. All right, we've discussed this this subject. So I was like this cat this can't be

524
00:43:30,460 --> 00:43:32,460
just like me dot

525
00:43:32,460 --> 00:43:36,340
So we just heard of a chain called famous Dave's. Yeah. Yeah

526
00:43:37,020 --> 00:43:40,240
Okay, so say famous Dave's or did you say peps place?

527
00:43:41,460 --> 00:43:48,540
My internet broke up. It's the distinction is basically is is what I'm saying is it is a

528
00:43:48,540 --> 00:43:52,020
Um, there is no distinction peps

529
00:43:53,140 --> 00:43:58,580
Circle peps place is a different way to order from famous days, which would have been a better

530
00:43:59,340 --> 00:44:01,340
headline

531
00:44:01,940 --> 00:44:06,060
Famous days has a way bigger menu the best place. This is well

532
00:44:06,060 --> 00:44:09,700
Yeah, but house place is a smaller restaurant that is in the corner

533
00:44:10,260 --> 00:44:12,260
Dave's is what we're

534
00:44:12,260 --> 00:44:19,460
Supposed to imagine they don't mention by the way in the press release. They do not say this is the food for famous. Yeah

535
00:44:20,020 --> 00:44:23,660
That's how that's how famous Dave is. They won't even give him a shout out

536
00:44:23,660 --> 00:44:26,060
No, no, no, it's from peps place a real restaurant

537
00:44:26,060 --> 00:44:29,900
Hey, tell me what you think of this idea boys business idea because you guys love this shit

538
00:44:29,900 --> 00:44:31,660
You watch Shark Tank and all that shit

539
00:44:31,660 --> 00:44:36,020
I'll go buy an aquarium and I'm gonna fill it with country time lemonade powder

540
00:44:36,020 --> 00:44:41,460
And I might put a hose in there and make that good yellow drink and I'm gonna throw that in the trunk of my car

541
00:44:41,460 --> 00:44:47,060
Which I will then crash into the foyer of a Burger King and then open the trunk and hang a sign out

542
00:44:47,060 --> 00:44:54,080
This is Griffin's place and then you can come there and get this lemonade forward experience at Griffin's place

543
00:44:55,500 --> 00:45:02,180
Catered by Bert the Burger King that I crashed my car into. Okay. Here's my question. I'm looking at two different menus

544
00:45:02,860 --> 00:45:05,560
Pest place is offering a brownie dessert

545
00:45:05,560 --> 00:45:12,800
If I don't have that it is very clearly a brownie dessert. They are under the desserts

546
00:45:12,800 --> 00:45:16,680
There's one option and it looks like a brownie with some whipped cream on top of it

547
00:45:17,040 --> 00:45:24,320
if I order from that pest place and I call them and I say I would like the apple cut the apple crisp and

548
00:45:24,320 --> 00:45:29,080
They're like that's not on the menu call famous days and say hi. I'm recalling for peps place

549
00:45:29,080 --> 00:45:33,400
They will think you are an absolute maniac. There is no way they will know about this

550
00:45:33,400 --> 00:45:39,600
I'm just saying if peps place is at famous days and famous days has peach cobbler and apple crisp and

551
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:43,920
Dave's award-winning bread pudding. I'm looking at the menu now in El Paso

552
00:45:43,920 --> 00:45:46,480
I should be able to get those things from peps place

553
00:45:46,480 --> 00:45:52,320
Why is peps place limiting the things I can order when I know they have access if you eat peach cobbler with peps?

554
00:45:52,320 --> 00:45:54,600
You'll fuck you'll die. You'll fucking die, dude

555
00:45:54,600 --> 00:45:59,480
I wish on the past days menu like we know this isn't the only food on earth

556
00:45:59,480 --> 00:46:04,640
But it is the only food you can eat safely with Pepsi. We're going to restrict

557
00:46:04,640 --> 00:46:08,560
You're not ready for the entire famous days menu. You can't handle it

558
00:46:08,560 --> 00:46:15,760
A lot of talk about diet coca-mentos and makes a big explosion all people talk about peepus does that with most foods?

559
00:46:16,320 --> 00:46:20,440
For years, we've known that Pepsi is the perfect complement to a variety of foods

560
00:46:20,600 --> 00:46:28,360
But even though consumers know that food tastes better with Pepsi, that's how I talk when I'm saying all caps better with Pepsi

561
00:46:28,360 --> 00:46:32,940
They often still forget to order a beverage with their favorite meals says Todd Kaplan

562
00:46:33,280 --> 00:46:38,640
Vice president of marketing of Pepsi inventing an absolute fucking fabrication. That doesn't happen

563
00:46:39,200 --> 00:46:41,860
for the convenience of his absolute

564
00:46:42,880 --> 00:46:49,320
Unhinged ghost restaurant with the launch of peps place. We've designed a new fast beverage restaurant

565
00:46:49,760 --> 00:46:52,960
Delivery concept that features a menu and experience

566
00:46:52,960 --> 00:46:58,040
Literally built around the idea of what foods go best with Pepsi

567
00:46:58,520 --> 00:47:02,120
Allowing consumers at home to fully optimize their meals

568
00:47:02,360 --> 00:47:09,520
We are confident that by doing this everyone will agree and taste firsthand how well Pepsi goes with their favorite foods

569
00:47:09,520 --> 00:47:11,520
Cool. So that's the news

570
00:47:12,520 --> 00:47:18,220
For for this week. Cool. Um, we can blast back to the past with a final yahoo

571
00:47:18,220 --> 00:47:22,660
Yeah, let's take a trip back I need a name for this segment also

572
00:47:22,660 --> 00:47:28,780
I'm so couldn't even be troubled to come up with the name of my graph. Wow. All right. Hey, you know what? Never mind

573
00:47:30,620 --> 00:47:35,700
We do have more show so you do have to say something so this final yahoo is from episode 5 and

574
00:47:37,220 --> 00:47:43,180
Yeah, it's a it's a very old one and the archive org of yahoo has been

575
00:47:43,180 --> 00:47:49,340
Really fucking up today, which is a shame. I think the way back machine is not putting a lot of their juice behind

576
00:47:49,540 --> 00:47:53,900
Keeping the yahoo answer service in its in its heart. Okay. No, but Matt

577
00:47:54,980 --> 00:48:01,700
Matt asked this and asked back in episode 5 so many years ago. Can you take parakeets in the shower with you?

578
00:48:02,020 --> 00:48:03,900
Hey, I'm thinking of getting a parakeet

579
00:48:03,900 --> 00:48:07,860
And I was wondering if it's possible to take them in the shower with you by using some kind of special perch

580
00:48:08,060 --> 00:48:12,680
Thanks. See you don't get those extra details in a final yahoo because I just get

581
00:48:12,680 --> 00:48:17,340
I get in there with the wham-bam. Thank you, ma'am. I get you with a good joke. Here's whoa

582
00:48:19,060 --> 00:48:21,420
We don't know much about birds or bird

583
00:48:22,420 --> 00:48:24,460
Biology, you don't oh, okay

584
00:48:25,500 --> 00:48:29,700
Yeah, go ahead. No, I don't either. Okay. Yeah, I mean there's water birds

585
00:48:29,700 --> 00:48:35,060
I've seen penguins swim and flamingos stand in the water. I don't know if they like to actually get down in it ducks

586
00:48:35,060 --> 00:48:40,660
Are another bird outside right? It rains outside and that's where birds usually do except for parakeets aren't really outside

587
00:48:40,660 --> 00:48:41,980
I

588
00:48:41,980 --> 00:48:46,980
Think the junk wait, I mean they were originally outside. Where are they Justin?

589
00:48:47,580 --> 00:48:49,580
You have no way of doing that

590
00:48:49,740 --> 00:48:54,580
Because here's the thing think about Justin think about this because this is what just happened to me, right?

591
00:48:54,580 --> 00:48:59,100
I thought well parakeets must originally come from the jungle. They're brightly covered colored bird

592
00:48:59,180 --> 00:49:02,980
Right like I can picture a parrot in the jungle

593
00:49:03,180 --> 00:49:08,980
Right, but when I try to picture like a parakeet in the wild my brain won't do it

594
00:49:08,980 --> 00:49:11,300
And also not to keep poking holes in this thing

595
00:49:11,300 --> 00:49:16,260
But I'm trying to imagine a wet parrot and I just can't get there guys. I bet it looks weird

596
00:49:16,660 --> 00:49:19,300
Yeah, I bet it's not a happy camper for sure

597
00:49:19,300 --> 00:49:25,980
I just assume most birds if they get the least bit wet they die instantly because they can't fly anymore because of the extra weight

598
00:49:26,540 --> 00:49:28,540
I think for this new

599
00:49:29,700 --> 00:49:34,260
For this new segment what I love is the idea of actually trying to get some answers here

600
00:49:34,580 --> 00:49:37,820
So I want to take you guys inside with the nest

601
00:49:37,820 --> 00:49:39,380
and

602
00:49:39,380 --> 00:49:43,540
their article how to bathe parakeets now step one is

603
00:49:44,500 --> 00:49:48,580
Spritz your parakeet gently with lukewarm water from a spray. Well, that's how I shower

604
00:49:48,580 --> 00:49:56,340
So these stars have aligned quite perfectly so far. Why isn't step one prepare your parakeet mentally for what's about to happen?

605
00:49:56,980 --> 00:49:59,220
Yeah, yeah, just absolutely not

606
00:49:59,860 --> 00:50:04,660
Just yeet a bunch of water onto your parakeet out of fucking nowhere. What the fuck was that?

607
00:50:04,660 --> 00:50:09,860
Well, I mean step one should be by or hatch a parakeet. Yeah, right

608
00:50:09,860 --> 00:50:13,940
I can't wonder into this article fucking parakeet lists and just lost from the jump

609
00:50:14,580 --> 00:50:19,340
If it if it likes it how to and how she enjoys this

610
00:50:19,340 --> 00:50:24,100
She will hold her wings away from her body and ruffle her feathers. She may also make a

611
00:50:24,700 --> 00:50:29,500
Budgie play face at you by gaping her beak and try to drink the water

612
00:50:30,820 --> 00:50:33,660
Except for very specific sure we can't do that

613
00:50:33,660 --> 00:50:37,820
Now what kind of spray bottle we're talking here? What's the max pressure?

614
00:50:40,180 --> 00:50:44,200
No, you want to actually absolutely just blaze your parakeet you want to blow it

615
00:50:44,940 --> 00:50:49,980
Blow it off its perch. But here's the thing, right if it if it likes it

616
00:50:50,500 --> 00:50:57,060
You can go for you could jump to step three and step three right here is the shower method

617
00:50:57,260 --> 00:51:02,780
Where it says I shit you not bring your parakeet into the bathtub or shower with you

618
00:51:02,780 --> 00:51:07,540
Spray her gently with the handheld shower nozzle and lukewarm or mildly warm water

619
00:51:07,700 --> 00:51:12,980
This option is for parakeets that love water and absolutely adore the spray bottle

620
00:51:12,980 --> 00:51:20,100
It adds extra excitement for your pet and turns bath time into a social event with her favorite person

621
00:51:21,380 --> 00:51:24,980
Does it specify whether or not I can wear my swim trunks?

622
00:51:24,980 --> 00:51:33,300
I don't want the parakeet to see me naked. Even worse though is if it does attack it

623
00:51:33,300 --> 00:51:38,300
And I have to fight it off in a sort of panic response. Then you get you get the question

624
00:51:38,300 --> 00:51:40,300
So you're like, what do I like?

625
00:51:40,420 --> 00:51:42,660
Like I just don't want to have to Justin

626
00:51:42,660 --> 00:51:46,460
I don't want to have to go to the doctor and when the doctor's like what happened to your penis?

627
00:51:46,460 --> 00:51:52,820
I don't want to be like well my parakeet panicked and it attacked right so I'm thinking maybe like I could wear my swim trunks

628
00:51:52,820 --> 00:51:57,660
And I'm gonna protect I want to protect my nipples too if I'm being honest. I was having a non-sexual bath

629
00:51:58,220 --> 00:52:00,220
with my parrot

630
00:52:00,460 --> 00:52:02,340
parrot

631
00:52:02,340 --> 00:52:05,660
His name's my parakeet parrot Pete is his name. Yeah

632
00:52:06,540 --> 00:52:11,420
My parakeets name Paris in there. All right, my parakeet parrot Pete. Yeah, my parrot parrot Keith

633
00:52:12,180 --> 00:52:18,940
And it was on the parapet and I got got a shower going and it went right for it and gosh, don't it?

634
00:52:18,940 --> 00:52:23,600
I should have seen it covered. This is your third visit this week. Yeah, doc

635
00:52:24,860 --> 00:52:29,860
Pretty bad down a lot of birds got even more showers, but how's the parakeet? Oh dead

636
00:52:29,940 --> 00:52:36,060
Yeah, no, he attacked my wiener in the shower and that's a private place. And you understand it's it's all in sick

637
00:52:36,060 --> 00:52:38,060
Yeah, it was all in

638
00:52:40,060 --> 00:52:46,140
Survival is caveman shit doc. I mean back our ancestors was it between friends?

639
00:52:46,140 --> 00:52:47,980
Just

640
00:52:47,980 --> 00:52:53,380
Hey, that's so cool. Hey everybody. Don't we have the coolest veterinarian in town and everybody's like, yeah

643
00:53:04,580 --> 00:53:12,820
Yeah parakeets the one that talks no, I don't think so fucking fine baby

644
00:53:18,500 --> 00:53:24,620
This guy he either tells me it's okay that I killed my birds or tries to buy him off of me at less than market

645
00:53:24,620 --> 00:53:26,620
rates

646
00:53:26,620 --> 00:53:33,900
I cause that he keeps saying he says so much funny shit like I'm not a vet and things like he dates my mom. Oh

647
00:53:34,820 --> 00:53:40,860
My god, yeah, Justin. Do you guys want to something? Absolutely wild. This is unrelated before we close the show as
