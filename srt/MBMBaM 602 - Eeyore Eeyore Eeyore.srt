1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,820
The McElroy brothers are not experts and their advice should never be followed

2
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:10,580
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it

3
00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:17,660
Also, this show isn't for kids which I mentioned only so the babies out there will know how cool they are for listening

4
00:00:17,660 --> 00:00:30,660
What's up, you cool, baby?

5
00:00:47,660 --> 00:00:50,060
It's better it's better with you

6
00:00:53,980 --> 00:00:56,060
It's better it's better with you

7
00:01:00,260 --> 00:01:02,260
Better it's better with you

8
00:01:10,180 --> 00:01:17,100
Hello everybody welcome to my brother my brother made a vice show for the modern era. I'm your oldest brother Justin McElroy

9
00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:22,060
I'm your middlest brother Travis McElroy. I'm your sweet baby brother Griffin McElroy

10
00:01:24,260 --> 00:01:26,260
Okay

11
00:01:26,940 --> 00:01:34,040
Not haunted doll watch it is a bad movie watch Batman watch Batman's back new another one the newest best Batman yet

12
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:36,040
They're saying Ben Affleck. Fuck you

13
00:01:36,340 --> 00:01:40,540
Christopher Nolan eat shit idiot cuz this Batman is

14
00:01:41,180 --> 00:01:45,100
The original Batman by which I do mean the Twilight gentlemen

15
00:01:45,100 --> 00:01:47,100
Have the bat

16
00:01:48,100 --> 00:01:49,420
Robert

17
00:01:49,420 --> 00:01:54,020
Rob pats is up in it. He's the new Batman which is funny because he was a Batman

18
00:01:54,900 --> 00:01:56,020
before oh

19
00:01:56,020 --> 00:02:02,860
I see and that's the first joke that that said has been said about that and that's thank you fucking great

20
00:02:02,860 --> 00:02:09,100
That's real quick. I want to highlight something wonderful about Robert Pattinson. I'd love to he recently revealed that

21
00:02:09,660 --> 00:02:13,940
Often in interviews he lies and I didn't know that was a thing you could do

22
00:02:13,940 --> 00:02:18,980
Okay, okay. I didn't know that when an interviewer is like, what are you working on?

23
00:02:18,980 --> 00:02:24,740
I'm like, what's your how's it going? You could just like I'm in six movies or whatever and like nobody checks it

24
00:02:24,740 --> 00:02:30,260
I like when he tried to describe the plot of Final Fantasy 7 to Zoe Kravitz during an interview and she was like

25
00:02:31,100 --> 00:02:34,780
Why do you think why do you think I give a shit about that Rob Pats?

26
00:02:35,340 --> 00:02:39,460
Anyway, he had an interview once that he wanted to open his own spaghetti restaurant

27
00:02:39,460 --> 00:02:44,620
That's good. Yeah, he's having fun out there, but you know who's not having fun Paul Dano

28
00:02:46,180 --> 00:02:48,280
Well, wait Paul Dano is a person

29
00:02:49,620 --> 00:02:52,600
He might be but he's the Riddler this time around which is

30
00:02:53,260 --> 00:02:56,220
Such good casting because when I look at that man, I think

31
00:02:56,980 --> 00:03:00,620
He's got some twisted shit up in there. What a mystery

32
00:03:01,860 --> 00:03:05,260
We're watching him the small yeah

33
00:03:05,260 --> 00:03:11,500
And he was in a skit where he cuz they had Zoe Kravitz the cat woman on there

34
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:14,460
And he was in a skit where he popped out from underneath the couch

35
00:03:15,220 --> 00:03:19,520
Funny in this skit it is it was funny and he was like, I don't know. I don't know what he said

36
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:25,540
He had a joke. I'm looking for change. Let's just say he said that and my wife Sydney Smurl McElroy who is not

37
00:03:26,980 --> 00:03:31,460
Super duper plugged in. Yeah culture said who's that?

38
00:03:31,460 --> 00:03:35,240
I I can't I don't mean it's Paul Dano, right obviously

39
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:40,100
Yeah, but it must have been so weird to have someone pop out from underneath the couch

40
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:45,420
Yeah, that you don't know who it is for like why is that man? Why is that Paul Dano look?

41
00:03:45,420 --> 00:03:51,500
Yeah, I love Paul Dano doesn't look like a lot of the people you would see on Saturday Night Live or television or the big

42
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:52,300
movie screen

43
00:03:52,300 --> 00:03:59,020
But he's having a tough time of it because he is playing Riddler and he did an interview and we're talking about a lot of interviews

44
00:03:59,020 --> 00:04:05,020
But this is an important one because he was talking about how the Riddler playing him and inhabiting him and being him

45
00:04:05,540 --> 00:04:07,540
Fucked him up

46
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:14,380
He said he said there were some nights around that

47
00:04:14,380 --> 00:04:19,380
I probably didn't sleep as well as I would have wanted to because it was a little hard to come down from the character takes

48
00:04:19,380 --> 00:04:21,700
Oh my god takes a lot of energy to get there

49
00:04:21,700 --> 00:04:25,620
and so you almost have to sustain it once you're there because going up and down is kind of hard and

50
00:04:25,620 --> 00:04:33,020
What what I felt was the opportunity that director Matt Reeves was giving with a villain in this film was more real potentially more terrifying

51
00:04:33,260 --> 00:04:35,260
My head was just throbbing with heat

52
00:04:35,660 --> 00:04:38,980
He said later about being encased in plastic wrap. I

53
00:04:39,540 --> 00:04:43,660
Went home that night after the first day and I couldn't sleep because I was scared of what was happening in my head

54
00:04:49,060 --> 00:04:54,780
Riddles where there weren't riddles the guy asked me if I wanted paper plastic I was like, oh what a conundrum

55
00:04:54,780 --> 00:05:00,540
I think that if the next Batman director comes to you and is like, hey, man

56
00:05:00,980 --> 00:05:07,580
Huge you're gonna be calendar man in this one. You should probably just say no fucking way. No doing it

57
00:05:07,580 --> 00:05:13,700
I'll do other I'll do other acting shit because those won't fuck with my head and make my head all hot

58
00:05:13,700 --> 00:05:16,100
So I can't sleep. Are you kidding me?

59
00:05:16,780 --> 00:05:20,300
There's a time where Danny DeVito's like I can't get the penguin out

60
00:05:20,300 --> 00:05:26,300
I'm more penguin than Danny DeVito at this point. He was a pleasant man before the penguin happened

61
00:05:26,300 --> 00:05:32,060
And now and now she'll tank Chris because the Riddler I mean the penguin didn't make his head so hot

62
00:05:32,740 --> 00:05:33,900
fire I

63
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:39,980
Also, just want to take this second to apologize to everybody who I ruined the Batman for yes

64
00:05:39,980 --> 00:05:45,740
Because they watch it in the Riddler's in and all they think of his room. He pissed. Yeah. Sorry. This was not my intention

65
00:05:45,740 --> 00:05:51,460
I apologize to the default, you know, right? I know family the sure and family

66
00:05:51,460 --> 00:05:53,580
Well, I the whole day and family

67
00:05:53,580 --> 00:05:58,620
I feel like that if he does he is a serial murderer in the film though, and I do feel like if you know

68
00:05:59,180 --> 00:06:06,380
Yeah, and if you murder a lot of people and ask some riddles here in there, they should call you the murderer

69
00:06:06,380 --> 00:06:12,060
The murderer who does riddles

70
00:06:12,380 --> 00:06:17,460
Yeah, maybe maybe like the question mark murderer maybe or like murderer

71
00:06:17,580 --> 00:06:21,340
No, I was gonna say murderer question mark, but that implies some ambiguity

72
00:06:21,340 --> 00:06:24,500
It does you're are kind of burying the lead a bit

73
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:28,420
The thing you have to know about this guy is he loves conundrums and delicious

74
00:06:29,060 --> 00:06:33,340
Fun. Yeah, there's also a little bit of murder on a lot of it

75
00:06:33,340 --> 00:06:35,340
Oh

76
00:06:35,460 --> 00:06:37,880
See murder more than he asks riddles. Yeah

77
00:06:39,780 --> 00:06:45,360
Zodiac Puzzle, man, they did. Yeah, that's you know, I mean, they're not is the code boy code master

78
00:06:47,540 --> 00:06:49,540
First the killer

79
00:06:52,140 --> 00:06:58,540
All of the Batman films should be murderer brackets riddles murderer brackets clown theme

80
00:06:58,540 --> 00:07:05,540
It's weird it's weird that I want one Batman that does is like I'm not doing the bullshit

81
00:07:05,980 --> 00:07:12,380
You don't do riddles. You're a murderer. I'm the riddler. I'm not calling you that. Oh the one with birds

82
00:07:12,380 --> 00:07:18,100
I'm not playing around. I'm I'm so busy. Do you think I have fucking time? I'm really busy

83
00:07:19,100 --> 00:07:24,060
Batman what can you put in a barrel to make it lighter? You're strangling someone, right?

84
00:07:24,060 --> 00:07:29,620
I'm gonna stop you strangling him for a moan and then we can address the riddle

85
00:07:29,620 --> 00:07:35,140
You've asked me the answer is a hole. I read this one in highlights when I was eight, please stop strangling the chief

86
00:07:36,580 --> 00:07:38,580
Chief are you cool?

87
00:07:41,580 --> 00:07:44,820
Give me a second. I was gonna get there. I

88
00:07:45,460 --> 00:07:49,280
Want to do it on my own as we another one the doctor was his mom

89
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:53,960
Fuck fuck being strangled socks stop him. He's

90
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:02,040
But Batman's doing great

91
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:07,920
Well, can I just say that it does confuse me a little bit it surprises me

92
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:12,520
Oh, because we've had a lot of Batman films we have

93
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:17,680
There's been a lot of Batman films and it it is weird to me because this one

94
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:19,800
Happens to be three

95
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:22,920
God damn hours

96
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:29,720
I don't understand. Listen, I'm a I'm a nerdy guy in his early 40s

97
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:37,240
Like I should be target demo, right? But by the same turn, I don't know how many chunks of three hours I have

98
00:08:37,920 --> 00:08:43,680
Ahead of me and I'm very surprised at so much. The American populace is like Batman. Let's go

99
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:47,900
I'll take three hours of that. Sure. Let's go three hours of the bat. I love it

100
00:08:47,900 --> 00:08:52,360
Give me a he's three hours though. It is weird to think that it occurred to me

101
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:57,560
We have more living actors who have portrayed Batman

102
00:08:58,400 --> 00:09:00,720
than there are living presidents and

103
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:05,360
That is wild to me in my lifetime in one generation. Yeah

104
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:12,900
Presidents keep fucking beefing though, don't they? Yeah, but like so we got seven if you include the

105
00:09:12,900 --> 00:09:17,100
Prominent voice actors, but yeah, we've got seven

106
00:09:17,860 --> 00:09:19,460
Batman's

107
00:09:19,460 --> 00:09:26,300
Well, but that man film is can't push back against something the Batman film is rated pg-13 and he's a serial killer

108
00:09:26,300 --> 00:09:33,180
So wait, man is no the Riddler. How does that portray like? Well, I oops a lot of people

109
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:36,660
I solved a lot of people

110
00:09:36,660 --> 00:09:43,020
I unlocked their chests my gun key

111
00:09:43,940 --> 00:09:45,940
This is getting too grizzly

112
00:09:46,220 --> 00:09:48,220
for pg-13

113
00:09:49,180 --> 00:09:51,480
Those people I can't tell you

114
00:09:52,660 --> 00:09:56,820
I really can't I don't know what happens after death

115
00:09:58,260 --> 00:10:00,260
The afterlife is the greatest

116
00:10:02,020 --> 00:10:06,640
I thought for a second just like you they were saying that Batman was a serial killer in this movie

117
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:08,820
And I was gonna be like, well that is a gritty term, huh?

118
00:10:09,100 --> 00:10:14,480
That would be a weird change if the Riddler looked at Batman like you have to calm it down

119
00:10:15,020 --> 00:10:20,540
I love I love Mack McElroy and but the man's been texting me and he's like

120
00:10:20,980 --> 00:10:25,300
You want to do Batman today and like guys I do legitimately have

121
00:10:26,060 --> 00:10:29,740
Like even when I do have a very little bit of free time

122
00:10:29,740 --> 00:10:36,780
Yeah, I just can't sit down for three hours and watch Batman. Here's what we need

123
00:10:36,780 --> 00:10:39,820
It's pretend. Do you know that? Yeah, I've been thinking about this

124
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:43,680
I got the two kids and finding a window of time

125
00:10:44,140 --> 00:10:48,660
Where I can go watch a pg-13 movie even for three hours is impossible

126
00:10:48,660 --> 00:10:54,180
So here's what I recommend movie theaters sell special old folks tickets for 38 year olds like me

127
00:10:54,180 --> 00:11:00,380
Where I can watch it an hour at a time, right and then I pop back in for hour two on another day

128
00:11:00,380 --> 00:11:05,260
I pop back in for hour three on a different day and you like punch holes in it just show like oh don't let him in

129
00:11:05,260 --> 00:11:11,180
For our one he's already watched that one and let me watch it in three chunks because the chances that I will that my window

130
00:11:11,180 --> 00:11:13,460
of time that I have three hours three free and

131
00:11:14,420 --> 00:11:20,980
Three hours worth of energy and interest in my body that will never align that will never happen

132
00:11:20,980 --> 00:11:25,180
We're so please let me watch the movie in chunks or just let me watch it at home

133
00:11:25,460 --> 00:11:29,260
Cuz we've been doing that the last two years. It's pretty great. You guys good guys

134
00:11:29,260 --> 00:11:35,100
Like we get it like is bed. You gotta see the big worm when it's big

135
00:11:35,380 --> 00:11:40,140
Yeah, but I'd rather see it small than not see it because it

136
00:11:40,900 --> 00:11:43,700
Does dune have a paw patrol timothy chalamet?

137
00:11:43,700 --> 00:11:47,420
It doesn't then I can't actually go see it on the big silver screen

138
00:11:47,420 --> 00:11:52,060
Unless you put it picture and picture on the big silver screen and the big picture is ball patrol

139
00:11:52,060 --> 00:11:56,660
I'm the little pictures dude, and I have one headphone in and the other one out so I can go

140
00:11:56,660 --> 00:12:00,260
Oh, yeah, buddy. Oh, yeah. Oh more popcorn. Can we pause dune?

141
00:12:00,620 --> 00:12:06,160
Yeah, we pause dune so I can go get my child more popcorn because they dumped theirs on the seat in front of them like

142
00:12:06,420 --> 00:12:08,300
idiot

143
00:12:08,300 --> 00:12:11,540
Anyway, that may get there three hours

144
00:12:12,220 --> 00:12:13,980
Having fun with our friends

145
00:12:13,980 --> 00:12:19,280
Get their best three hours non-stop to me. I bet there's no fat on no

146
00:12:19,740 --> 00:12:22,900
On that definitely not all we know

147
00:12:24,060 --> 00:12:25,340
definitely

148
00:12:25,340 --> 00:12:32,180
What do you think the odds are it is the first reboot of an of a new Batman franchise, right?

149
00:12:32,180 --> 00:12:35,500
And so what are the eyes wait since when Griffin?

150
00:12:35,780 --> 00:12:42,980
because like the first reboot in the most the most recent reboot of the Batman franchise does it end with like and

151
00:12:42,980 --> 00:12:44,300
you

152
00:12:44,300 --> 00:12:45,980
hear like

153
00:12:45,980 --> 00:12:49,580
The Riddler gets, you know blown up or whatever by Batman's cool

154
00:12:51,380 --> 00:12:56,940
Missile launcher or something Batman Batman stabs him and kills him but then in his pocket, what does he find?

155
00:12:56,940 --> 00:12:58,100
It's not a riddle

156
00:12:58,100 --> 00:13:03,540
It's a picture of a clown because Joker is the next one like it's got to be something like that where it's like

157
00:13:03,540 --> 00:13:06,420
Oh, I've decided to move on from riddles now

158
00:13:06,420 --> 00:13:11,740
I'm doing jokes and then in the next movie Paul Dano's gonna play the Joker and he's gonna be

159
00:13:11,740 --> 00:13:17,660
We can't recover from we won't be able to salvage Paul Dano after that

160
00:13:19,020 --> 00:13:24,780
There will be too many broken pieces of Paul Dano to try to glue him back together if he plays the Riddler and the Joker

161
00:13:26,100 --> 00:13:29,820
They should let him play Batman next to balance it out. Yes

162
00:13:29,820 --> 00:13:34,540
I know like Superman let him play somebody who's like super light and fluffy next

163
00:13:34,540 --> 00:13:42,340
Okay, and it's just like if you play a Batman villain in a great Batman movie next you get to be like Captain

164
00:13:42,340 --> 00:13:43,380
Shazam

165
00:13:43,380 --> 00:13:45,380
Shazam, there you go

166
00:13:46,300 --> 00:13:51,100
Fucking Levi or whatever his name is like every day rolled up the set like

167
00:13:51,980 --> 00:13:55,180
How you doing there Zach? Pretty good, man. I'm Shazam

168
00:13:55,180 --> 00:14:03,020
I'm Shazam, I got nothing to worry about. Are you sure you're in the right headspace to play Shazam? You got I just won Mario Kart

169
00:14:03,020 --> 00:14:05,020
I'm in a great good headspace

170
00:14:05,260 --> 00:14:10,020
Paul are you okay? You look like shit. No, man. I couldn't sleep last night the riddles made my head so hot

171
00:14:10,660 --> 00:14:14,900
Here just take a break playing Mario Kart. I can't don't you understand?

172
00:14:14,900 --> 00:14:20,100
I can't, but to turn my mind away from the riddles for a moment is to betray my sacred charge

173
00:14:21,140 --> 00:14:23,140
anyway, despite I

174
00:14:23,140 --> 00:14:28,300
Listen a lot of people were hoping the walking Phoenix Joker would show up

175
00:14:28,300 --> 00:14:34,620
Oh, that's what it isn't then you walking Phoenix like fucking moonwalks onto the screen during the credits like

176
00:14:35,340 --> 00:14:37,340
Catch you next time bats

177
00:14:37,620 --> 00:14:42,780
But I have an article here from Game Rant that explains why it can't possibly happen

178
00:14:42,780 --> 00:14:47,140
Oh shit, I want to run through just so you guys are prepared for the different. Okay

179
00:14:47,140 --> 00:14:53,460
so in 2019's Joker the Joker does not even face Batman and in fact

180
00:14:53,540 --> 00:14:57,780
Operates in a Gotham City that appears to be without the caped crusader. I have noticed that

181
00:14:57,780 --> 00:15:00,900
Yeah, that is that yeah, you notice how Batman's not in it

182
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:05,220
I did not actually reference Bruce Wayne as a young boy. So that's that they don't have one

183
00:15:05,220 --> 00:15:08,540
So here's the first problem high tech versus no tech. Oh, yeah

184
00:15:09,460 --> 00:15:16,180
He has he has a bat being a billionaire gives one access to technology that the rest simply cannot yeah

185
00:15:16,180 --> 00:15:20,820
Wait, hey, sorry article writer. I'm sure that there's some good insight in here

186
00:15:20,860 --> 00:15:21,580
But yeah

187
00:15:21,580 --> 00:15:28,580
You've just summarized the whole point of Batman as a superhero in the Batman's new trailer Batman uses one of his gauntlets to electrocute

188
00:15:28,580 --> 00:15:30,500
And take down the enemy combatant

189
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:33,460
Conversely Joaquin Phoenix Joker barely knows how to shoot a gun

190
00:15:33,460 --> 00:15:33,900
Yeah

191
00:15:33,900 --> 00:15:37,860
If the two were to meet in combat the fight would be over with one use of Batman's grappling hook

192
00:15:38,140 --> 00:15:44,280
Batarangs or a few punches the scene would barely be enough to fit a trailer let alone an entire film next bullet point

193
00:15:44,280 --> 00:15:49,000
Batman can fight the Joker cannot. Yeah. Yeah, that's a great point to shit

194
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:55,800
I didn't you almost never is there a scene where Batman and the Joker fucking Duke?

195
00:15:57,040 --> 00:16:02,160
Phoenix's Joker is easily kicked to the ground by three smug civilians in white-collar clothing

196
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:08,080
How would this iteration of the Joker fight against the greatest melee tactician in Gotham City? He simply would not

197
00:16:08,680 --> 00:16:10,500
next point

198
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:17,280
Batman is young and physically fit the gym the Joker is older and not physically fit

199
00:16:17,280 --> 00:16:20,440
Yeah, the Batman would kick the Joker's ass

200
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:24,120
Can I read here's another interview with?

201
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:33,520
Allergic to Batman here's one with here's an interview with Joaquin Phoenix or he's talking about playing the Joker as humans were so malleable

202
00:16:33,520 --> 00:16:38,080
It's probably how we survive and just and adapt when making a movie my whole life changes. I go to a new city

203
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:41,480
I'm living in a new place. I don't have any photos from home or anything that reminds me of my life

204
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:46,520
I don't know that you I don't know that you know how it changes you or whether it does

205
00:16:46,520 --> 00:16:53,720
But I certainly don't have any great actor stories about having nightmares or stuff like that. Honestly, I had so much fun making this

206
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:56,200
meanwhile Paul Dano

207
00:16:58,840 --> 00:17:06,400
So hot his pants are so wet from nightmare piss is someone stopping Joaquin Phoenix from bringing photos of home

208
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:12,640
Yes, you could take him off the chain and just turn that dog

209
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:19,720
Like I'm in a new city, I don't know anyone I don't have anything that reminds me of my life

210
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:24,640
I burn I burn my I burn my driver's license

211
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:31,720
I bury all my clothes in the desert in an unmarked grave that signify the death of the old me basic style of the grid

212
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:36,680
The last point that I didn't want to touch on from this game

213
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:41,040
Is that Joaquin Phoenix's iteration of the Joker is not really the Joker. Oh, yeah

214
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:45,720
Yeah, yeah, I mean he calls himself the Joker and wants everyone to call him the Joker and lives in Gotham City

215
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:47,720
It does crime

216
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:54,800
Because it says here the Joker is a character who has a tragic backstory that no one is entirely sure about sure

217
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:57,640
But eventually he falls into a vat of chemicals while being chased by Batman

218
00:17:57,640 --> 00:18:04,880
I know he emerges physically and mentally warped becoming the Joker. He is not just a clown at face paint. Well, okay

219
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:10,400
Furthermore Phoenix's Joker is not a criminal mastermind nor an anarchist nor gangster

220
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:15,200
He is really just a man who has lived a less than ideal life and has some unaddressed issues. Yeah

221
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:19,880
Didn't see Joker with Joaquin Phoenix, but that does sound like

222
00:18:20,840 --> 00:18:26,600
Sounds like a role you would take I saw it over someone's shoulder on an airplane and I bet that was my takeaway from it

223
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:33,120
Yeah, cuz there was can I say there was no point where he squirted someone with like acid out of a little pail flower

224
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:39,040
There was no point what he didn't have like a big mallet that like a bomb came out of or something

225
00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:44,280
And the Batman from what I could see the person in front of me kept like moving their head around

226
00:18:44,360 --> 00:18:46,360
But from what I could see Batman

227
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:52,560
Only appeared eight times in the movie, but never never as the Batman

228
00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:57,320
It was always someone or I was like that could be Bruce Wayne and it like but he never put on the suit and

229
00:18:57,680 --> 00:19:01,120
But it was like George Clooney was in it. Affleck was in it

230
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:06,160
Pattinson was in it. They did like it was like a you know in that one scene in Doctor Who where it's like

231
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:12,240
It's all the doctors. Yeah, it was like it's all the Batman's together. You did dream this what? Yeah

232
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:18,360
I'm really worried about how long we talked about Batman every morning every morning

233
00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:23,120
I sit inside my friend's car with her and another friend before school

234
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:30,520
Yeah, it worked. Yeah, the other day when we were getting out of her car to start heading to class

235
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:32,880
She said autobots roll out

236
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:37,320
Under her breath. I feel like something's being lost here

237
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:43,160
Yeah, people listening may not have followed that other day when we were getting out of the car to start heading to class

238
00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:48,800
She said autobots roll out under her breath when she set saw that we noticed

239
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:52,320
She said that she hadn't meant for us to hear her and she became embarrassed

240
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:56,300
Mistaking our genuine joy at her statement for laughter at her expense

241
00:19:56,800 --> 00:20:00,600
Even though we've tried to explain that we legitimately liked it. She won't say it again

242
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:03,880
How could we convince her to say it again or even say it every day?

243
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:10,320
Or is it better to just leave it and not bother her about it? Have we already ruined it by drawing attention to it?

244
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:14,120
Yes, I would love to start every morning with my friend saying autobots roll out

245
00:20:14,120 --> 00:20:16,280
But I don't want to press the issue if he'll just annoy her

246
00:20:16,360 --> 00:20:23,280
How can I get her to continue saying it without accidentally putting her in an uncomfortable position that's from anonymous autobot in Orlando

247
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:29,600
Florida your friend your friend is not Bart Simpson like with great catchphrases

248
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:34,760
That they say every day every episode to like get the crowd rolling

249
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:37,280
But why not Griffin?

250
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:45,400
Mmm. Yeah, why not if I have the chance to be a Bart Simpson ask catchphrase machine that would get

251
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:51,040
All I'd have to do is say autobots roll out and my friends would just bust the fuck up

252
00:20:51,040 --> 00:20:55,040
Yeah, this is the thing though. It's like yeah, I want to tell you the macro way handling this

253
00:20:55,040 --> 00:20:59,320
It's a perfectly good bit your friend doesn't want anymore. Now. It's your business your bit

254
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:04,840
You know that this bit works it already crushed right right and they don't want the bit anymore

255
00:21:04,840 --> 00:21:08,200
So that's your bit now you are the one who's like autobots raw

256
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:12,400
You're the you're the fucking Keurig cup of coffee that's getting everybody's day roll

257
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:15,200
Oh, you know the good little head jumpstart also McRoy way

258
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:17,560
Let me tell you how to make it better cuz I'm me

259
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:21,360
Make it a call and response you say autobots

260
00:21:22,280 --> 00:21:29,480
Right, and then if you do it like that and leave that little look at the end you have to I mean like you just

261
00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:32,780
Have to you're not gonna leave it. Hey, they'll say roll out saving a haircut to

262
00:21:32,780 --> 00:21:38,700
Right exactly autobots roll out right and now it's a thing because what you don't want to do

263
00:21:38,700 --> 00:21:40,540
This is the tricky thing about making it your own bit

264
00:21:40,540 --> 00:21:45,820
Dustin is you don't want to make it seem like you're making it as an in-joke making fun of oh

265
00:21:46,780 --> 00:21:51,540
God Travis is actually a good point. Yes weird cuz now cuz it would be easy what wait

266
00:21:54,180 --> 00:21:58,940
It would be easy for your friend to see it as like well now it's a joke about the fact that I said it now

267
00:21:58,940 --> 00:22:03,540
They're dunking on me. Yes, but if you make it a call and response now, it's saying we're all in this

268
00:22:03,660 --> 00:22:07,140
This is all of us here. This is an exciting thing that the three of us can share

269
00:22:07,740 --> 00:22:12,620
Every morning before we've got to go into miss Dinkins class, which we all know fucking sucks, right?

270
00:22:12,620 --> 00:22:18,100
We can have this one brief moment of joy in our young lives as we all share through this reference

271
00:22:18,100 --> 00:22:20,140
Which if you're going to school, I don't know why

272
00:22:20,740 --> 00:22:25,580
Autobots roll out as a reference any of you get but congratulations on being so fucking cool

273
00:22:25,580 --> 00:22:32,260
I don't think in the Sam Witwicky movies with the Shia LaBeouf

274
00:22:32,780 --> 00:22:37,340
Sam Witwicky, I don't think they ever say Autobots roll out do they guarantee they do

275
00:22:37,340 --> 00:22:40,940
It's got me in like the fifth film though. And he's like, oh, yeah. Yeah ever all is lost

276
00:22:40,940 --> 00:22:42,900
It's right after the all is lost. He's like

277
00:22:42,900 --> 00:22:48,380
Autobots roll out as he dies. Why did you say like he was dying as as he melts?

278
00:22:48,380 --> 00:22:52,380
Oh Autobots

279
00:22:52,380 --> 00:22:54,380
Hey, if I ever saw people doing a call and response

280
00:22:54,900 --> 00:22:58,420
Autobots roll out regardless of where I am or what the situation is

281
00:22:58,420 --> 00:23:04,340
I will I will I will start going to wedgie school to learn how to do it the best I can possibly get out

282
00:23:04,340 --> 00:23:05,940
You would get in the car with them

283
00:23:05,940 --> 00:23:10,780
If there's an empty seat you would hear them and like jump in and be like roll out. I'm part of it, too

284
00:23:10,780 --> 00:23:13,980
I know you Griffin you clearly don't

285
00:23:13,980 --> 00:23:18,100
You would wedgie you would wedgie rather than join

286
00:23:19,100 --> 00:23:25,740
You're what's wrong with society Griffin. I don't think I am actually on this one. I don't think that this is on this one

287
00:23:25,740 --> 00:23:30,660
I don't think it's not I'm not ideal for society in this example, but I don't think I'm the

288
00:23:31,420 --> 00:23:37,780
You know the main cheese. I just got excited because I thought there's probably somewhere someone that sells

289
00:23:37,780 --> 00:23:45,780
Like I can get an autobots like hood ornament. So it looks like my car is a transformer in disguise

290
00:23:46,460 --> 00:23:53,100
And I'm there's no joke here. I'm just really excited about the possibility of this. Okay. Oh, I want it so bad

291
00:23:53,740 --> 00:23:58,180
Imagine what if someone looked at my car and said he's the new sandwich wiki. The wizard is

292
00:23:59,020 --> 00:24:05,620
Shired up off. Are you okay in his throne? He wants us to approach him if yes, can I just real quick?

293
00:24:05,620 --> 00:24:06,740
I want you to

294
00:24:06,740 --> 00:24:11,460
Frank I just want to talk about Peter Cullen real quick. He's the voice actor behind Optimus Prime and

295
00:24:12,340 --> 00:24:18,000
He's very focused a lot of voice actors. They're kind of bouncing all over the place and I got to give a shout out to

296
00:24:19,180 --> 00:24:26,860
To Peter Cullen, I'm gonna read just real quick. I'm just gonna read down his list of credits

297
00:24:26,860 --> 00:24:28,860
Oh, please in recent years, okay

298
00:24:28,860 --> 00:24:35,840
Optimus Prime Optimus Prime Optimus Prime Optimus Prime Optimus Prime Optimus Prime Optimus Prime

299
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:37,180

Optimus Prime Optimus Prime Optimus Prime Optimus Prime Optimus Prime Optimus Prime

301
00:24:43,460 --> 00:24:45,580

Optimus Prime Optimus Prime

303
00:24:47,220 --> 00:24:52,520
Optimus Prime

304
00:24:52,520 --> 00:24:54,080
Optimus Prime

305
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:55,240
Optimus Prime

306
00:24:55,240 --> 00:24:57,660
Optimus Prime

307
00:24:57,660 --> 00:24:59,780
Eeyore. Eeyore. Eeyore. Eeyore. Eeyore.

308
00:24:59,780 --> 00:25:01,200
Okay, now it's Prime.

309
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:03,900
The eeyore has lost all meaning to me now.

310
00:25:03,900 --> 00:25:05,440
Eeyore. Eeyore. Eeyore.

311
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:07,320
And it's like, an error message in a fancy robot.

312
00:25:07,740 --> 00:25:10,180
Captain Nathaniel Flint, in Treasure Planet.

313
00:25:12,340 --> 00:25:15,020
K-k-k-k-k- combo breaker!

314
00:25:16,060 --> 00:25:18,060
He had a fucking twen- that was in 2002.

315
00:25:18,460 --> 00:25:20,060
Treasure Planet whips ass, by the way.

316
00:25:20,060 --> 00:25:20,560
Yeah.

317
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:22,220
I saw it for the first time a couple weeks ago.

318
00:25:22,220 --> 00:25:24,620
That movie, fucking- Griffin have you seen Treasure Planet?

319
00:25:24,620 --> 00:25:25,900
Fuck yeah, whips ass, Michael J.

320
00:25:25,900 --> 00:25:26,900
Yeah, whips ass.

321
00:25:26,900 --> 00:25:31,860
Whips ass. Do you think that he got to Captain Nathaniel Flint and he started to do like

322
00:25:32,380 --> 00:25:36,620
Optimus Prime voice and they're like no not that one and he's heard do er and they're like not that one

323
00:25:36,620 --> 00:25:41,540
He's like wait what fuck do you want them? Wait? Why am I here? What what what one?

324
00:25:42,060 --> 00:25:47,660
Maybe he loved the role of Captain Nathaniel Flint so much that he was like, this is it

325
00:25:47,660 --> 00:25:57,780
I'm retiring from voice acting forever and they're like, you're still gonna do either right? He's like, you know, I love that

326
00:25:57,780 --> 00:25:58,980
sad donkey

327
00:25:58,980 --> 00:26:00,980
Disney acquires Hasbro

328
00:26:01,420 --> 00:26:08,020
Bringing the transformers under the Disney license. Okay, and this is this this this will happen

329
00:26:09,460 --> 00:26:15,180
That means Kingdom Hearts for this lucky gentleman gets to play your and transformers

330
00:26:15,180 --> 00:26:21,920
And I think treasure planet and treasure planet guy. Yeah. Fuck. Yeah. What a good day. That's a

331
00:26:22,500 --> 00:26:26,780
Hey, can the wizard can we talk about him real quick? Oh, no, no, please. Yes, of course, of course

332
00:26:27,300 --> 00:26:32,980
I'm so sorry. I didn't mean to give you away. Yeah, this one's in it by the other wizard Ben can't thank you Ben

333
00:26:33,780 --> 00:26:39,900
So it's it's just the wiki house staff sent this one. Wow, they wrote this last year. It got

334
00:26:41,180 --> 00:26:42,260
63%

335
00:26:42,260 --> 00:26:48,420
Quality vote from the audience not great. That's a bad score. So, you know passing

336
00:26:49,140 --> 00:26:54,500
Yeah, but the riddles calm audience are miscreants like this isn't riddles calm

337
00:26:55,380 --> 00:26:57,380
Griffith's not pulling these wiki

338
00:26:59,580 --> 00:27:05,140
I got a wire cross. It's not a big deal. Okay. Okay. Well, um, oh, yeah, but I'm sorry guys

339
00:27:05,140 --> 00:27:07,720
I try to stop thinking about riddles and we're head

340
00:27:07,720 --> 00:27:12,920
So fucking hot it sucks. So this is how to use bad language without getting in trouble. Yes

341
00:27:13,480 --> 00:27:18,920
Nice part very important one staying out of trouble at home. Ask your parents what you're allowed to say

342
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:21,000
That's well

343
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:24,040
That's I guess it takes a lot of the fun out of it

344
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:31,320
But I guess you can do that where it's like hey, how do we feel about bastard? No

345
00:27:32,120 --> 00:27:34,120
What if I say like this bastard?

346
00:27:34,120 --> 00:27:39,960
Can I say kick-ass or when referring to a donkey father?

347
00:27:40,440 --> 00:27:46,800
How would you prefer I refer to a donkey father? Oh, this is good because you can do the slow erosion method here

348
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:53,080
Where it's just like ass is okay. Great. Okay. Well, I'm gonna say like kick-ass and then I'm gonna say is it cool?

349
00:27:53,080 --> 00:27:58,640
If I say shit, well, what if it's just like in the mo, right and you're gonna do basically what we have done to

350
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:05,560
Like cable TV where eventually it's just like what what is the fuck ever man? Yeah, I don't have the energy to care anymore

351
00:28:05,560 --> 00:28:10,240
I remember the first time someone said shit on cable TV and we were all like, whoa

352
00:28:10,920 --> 00:28:15,080
Yeah, and now they can say things like, you know, really naughty words

353
00:28:15,080 --> 00:28:20,960
Well like South Park had an episode where they had a counter going in the current corner of the screen and I counted

354
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:25,560
That's so fucking twisted. It was so twisted. So like a hundred times

355
00:28:25,560 --> 00:28:27,360
Like a half hour is so cool

356
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:27,880
Okay

357
00:28:27,880 --> 00:28:32,560
So you might want to say something in a polite tone such as I feel like I'm getting old enough to say certain things

358
00:28:32,560 --> 00:28:37,840
I wasn't allowed to say before and I want to run this idea by you and see if you think there are certain words

359
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:44,600
I can say now that are less offensive than hey pop pop. I'm 10 now, right? Yeah, I want to say fuck

360
00:28:45,080 --> 00:28:51,720
No, son. No, son. That's okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. What about shit? I meet you halfway. We'll do piss

361
00:28:51,720 --> 00:28:59,160
We'll do piss and ass until you're 13 and then we'll see if you can show me you're responsible enough to handle piss and ass

362
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:06,040
We will circle back on shit and ass. Can I call people an ass or do I can I only say that kiss my ass?

363
00:29:06,040 --> 00:29:13,340
Oh boy, son. Uh, I think I think referring to your own heinie as an ass is okay

364
00:29:14,520 --> 00:29:18,680
Okay, and it's son if I find out that you went at school and said I got to take a piss or

365
00:29:18,680 --> 00:29:24,960
I got to take an ass piss, which is nothing son that I got pissed out by ass. Is that anything?

366
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:29,040
That's not you've lost it. Now. You've lost both. Can I say asshole you?

367
00:29:30,040 --> 00:29:33,840
Absolutely, you could say asshole. Okay, be conscious of who's around you

368
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:34,500
If you swear at home

369
00:29:34,500 --> 00:29:40,040
You're giving everyone in your home the capability of hearing you make sure your parents are several rooms away before uttering a bad word

370
00:29:40,040 --> 00:29:48,720
Awesome, they're both in the kitchen having another argument, but you're in your bedroom. Just going ass ass ass bastard

371
00:29:49,800 --> 00:29:56,720
Well, maybe they're in their bedroom and they're saying dirty words quiet too because they don't think they're allowed to say them and say

372
00:29:56,720 --> 00:30:01,760
No, you have more in common than you don't maybe it'd be cool if all the parents are all the parents and kids just got

373
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:06,400
In front of each other. This is what I'm saying. Like Justin and I have never cursed in front of each other

374
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:12,160
And I think it would really bring us together Justin would curse right now. Choose your words wisely as culture change

375
00:30:12,160 --> 00:30:16,080
This is a quote, but it's not true. It's not gonna curse. I wanted to hear Justin what?

376
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:20,320
He did he said it don't make him do it twice

377
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:27,520
Fuck. All right, choose your words wisely as culture. This is a quote un-attributed as culture changes. So does what is taboo?

378
00:30:28,560 --> 00:30:32,480
Sure. Awesome. Somebody probably said that at some point. Somebody must have said it at some point

379
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:38,440
I mean, it sounds like something someone's would say it's best if you determine a list of curse words that you find acceptable and won't

380
00:30:38,440 --> 00:30:44,520
Accidentally offend someone that doesn't exist. Make up your own curse words. Oh, how cool is that? Oh

381
00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:47,040
Piff. Oh

382
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:49,040
shooty, oh

383
00:30:49,320 --> 00:30:51,000
Shig

384
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:53,000
Piff my blink. Oh

385
00:30:54,200 --> 00:30:56,680
Oh, I belonged everywhere

386
00:30:56,680 --> 00:31:04,680
So anyway, do not curse. I want to say in that circumstance, I don't know what belong was standing in for. Yeah, it's a little smurfy

387
00:31:04,680 --> 00:31:06,880
I belonged everywhere. You shit everywhere

388
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:14,120
Do not curse in front of your parents friends, even if you're not home other parents and adults may relay what you said back to your parents

389
00:31:14,760 --> 00:31:18,600
It should have an asterisk there. This one's actually a pretty good one

390
00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:27,360
because I remember I had friends and we were in their car listening to the Big Monty musical soundtrack and they were like

391
00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:32,400
Full Monty. Did I say Big Monty? Which I think was a pizza you could get from Monty's Pizza

392
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:37,160
so anyway, they were doing the Big Monty which meant the whole balls and everything and

393
00:31:37,800 --> 00:31:44,960
Singing along. Now hold on, the full Monty is everything. The Big Monty is just one testicle and shaft. One nut. Yeah, so

394
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:51,520
They were singing along. You're holding back one testicle. They were singing along with all the cuss words in everything and I was like, okay

395
00:31:51,520 --> 00:31:57,400
So we're cussing then but then there's a part that talks about smoking a joint and I sang that part out loud and they were like

396
00:31:57,400 --> 00:32:02,300
Whoa Griffin, that's drugs and I was like, so wait a minute. Anyway

397
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:06,400
Using bad language at school one avoid cursing during class or to your teacher

398
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:12,400
A lot of these are just like here's how to curse don't do it in front of anybody do it in your own secret hole

399
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:15,320
Kind of cut a hole in a sheet

400
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:19,600
Hole in the backyard and lay

401
00:32:20,120 --> 00:32:21,280
lay

402
00:32:21,280 --> 00:32:24,760
AstroTurf over it to make your own secret space where you can say cuss words

403
00:32:24,920 --> 00:32:28,520
Don't do that because if you curse that hole and then cover it up, you might grow a fuck tree

404
00:32:28,520 --> 00:32:30,520
You might want to do that. Oh

405
00:32:31,080 --> 00:32:35,740
Happen to Eddie Murphy in 1000 words. Exactly what happened to Eddie Murphy. We can't keep referencing that movie every episode

406
00:32:35,740 --> 00:32:42,380
Then use bad language during busy times or class changes cool

407
00:32:42,940 --> 00:32:48,940
Time to head to fucking math. What it's good math that you have no jurisdiction over me. Damn it. I

408
00:32:50,500 --> 00:32:55,220
Can't I do apologize if a teacher hears you sometimes it feels natural to let a curse word out

409
00:32:55,220 --> 00:32:57,180
If you drop a book your backpack rips open. Yeah

410
00:32:57,180 --> 00:33:00,180
Yeah, in those cases if a teacher happens to overhear you and starts glaring at you

411
00:33:00,180 --> 00:33:02,180
It's best to be sincere and apologize for the outburst

412
00:33:02,180 --> 00:33:08,300
And especially if it's your cool teacher Mike who doesn't want you to call him like mr

413
00:33:08,300 --> 00:33:12,380
Smith he's just like call me Mike you could probably curse in front of Mike as long as it's not the f-word and you

414
00:33:12,380 --> 00:33:16,740
Keep your grades up. That's how he tricks you actually Mike is actually a cuss cop and he wants to catch

415
00:33:18,620 --> 00:33:24,220
He's like cool, but he is not cool not Mike it is mystifying to me

416
00:33:24,220 --> 00:33:29,400
I want to give a quick shout out to parents who have decided that it is worth policing profanity

417
00:33:29,400 --> 00:33:35,240
Because like I honestly guys there's so many things that you have to fix about kids. Yeah, it's just a game of triage

418
00:33:35,240 --> 00:33:35,800
Oh, yeah

419
00:33:35,800 --> 00:33:41,040
I like we we want them to like be kind to themselves and to other people and

420
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:45,480
Even that has been a multi-year fail. Oh, man, like

421
00:33:47,480 --> 00:33:50,040
It is a fucking sinkhole of

422
00:33:50,560 --> 00:33:55,900
Energy and time and money. Yeah, and it is going nowhere and it has been the one thing

423
00:33:55,900 --> 00:34:00,280
We've tried to do is make them decent people and you can't it's like going no

424
00:34:00,280 --> 00:34:02,760
Yeah, we're at less than zero and I feel like

425
00:34:03,320 --> 00:34:07,800
Shout out to you if you're like, I'm gonna do that. But also they can't say fuck

426
00:34:07,800 --> 00:34:16,320
I really I don't have the energy God bless anybody who can but I'm barely getting I would rather have my daughter

427
00:34:17,200 --> 00:34:23,200
BB stand in front of a room full of the judges people on earth and yell fuck with abandon if

428
00:34:23,200 --> 00:34:28,880
I could just stop her from awkwardly standing on top of every unstable surface

429
00:34:28,880 --> 00:34:33,520
She could find yes, like I would I'd be like, yeah, honey say whatever the fuck you want. Just please get down

430
00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:37,960
What are you doing? Please get off the calculator, honey. Why would you see him? Why do you stand on daddy's computer?

431
00:34:37,960 --> 00:34:42,920
Don't stand on that's even elevated that money like paper towel roll. What are you doing? Yes. Yes

432
00:34:43,400 --> 00:34:45,840
Yes, you can't stand on that. It's not load-bearing

433
00:34:47,400 --> 00:34:51,160
Practice being polite to school administrators. It doesn't say keep your grades up

434
00:34:51,160 --> 00:34:56,920
But I think we all know I mean that's implied there. Did you say do you curse in a polite way?

435
00:34:56,920 --> 00:34:59,320
You're like well, fuck you very much. I'll be moving

436
00:34:59,320 --> 00:34:59,480
No

437
00:34:59,480 --> 00:35:05,280
but I think if you're like a super polite valedictorian and you say fuck a teacher in the public school system is

438
00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:10,520
Thrilled right like what a long game that would be if you're like in your vector

439
00:35:11,600 --> 00:35:15,440
valedictorian speech and you're like anyway in closing a fuck

440
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:21,840
Oh, wow, nobody can say anything you're the valedictorian apparently cursing is good and cool, right?

441
00:35:22,080 --> 00:35:26,800
Well, if you're 18 at that point, what are they gonna do? What are they gonna do?

442
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:31,200
Call vassar and get me kicked out. No fucking way man. I'm

443
00:35:31,720 --> 00:35:33,760
Vassar when this goes viral. Yeah

444
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:40,720
Can you remember when you guys started college and that freshman class and you just realized like I can say fuck here

445
00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:47,120
Like they're not gonna call my parents. It actually was a fuck. It wasn't something I was waiting on

446
00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:55,560
All right, let me finish this because we just got to the fun part of the article which is swearing with your friends

447
00:35:55,560 --> 00:35:58,480
Oh, yeah, make sure your friends are okay with cursing

448
00:35:59,840 --> 00:36:05,600
It was almost fun for a second or is like do you mind hey, pardon me. Do you mind if I say ass?

449
00:36:05,600 --> 00:36:12,440
Oh, thank you, Timothy. My best friend for life. I do have to ask you these questions ask your friends to keep it a secret

450
00:36:12,440 --> 00:36:16,140
And then there's somebody winking and putting a little shush finger up like shh

Don't get too used to cursing with your friends

453
00:36:26,780 --> 00:36:31,680
Sometimes you get too comfortable swearing with the people you trust if this happens you could end up accidentally cursing around your family

454
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:36,480
This is a quick and easy way to get yourself into trouble. That's true, man. That's so to summarize

455
00:36:37,360 --> 00:36:39,440
How do you use bad language without getting in trouble?

456
00:36:40,440 --> 00:36:45,800
Do it in a room that nobody else is in no one's gonna hear you but Jesus and

He can definitely keep a secret. He can hang man. He can hang man with the best

458
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:54,000

00:36:55,120 --> 00:36:57,120
real dirty mouths

460
00:36:57,120 --> 00:37:01,160
Do you guys remember that commercial for that gum?

461
00:37:04,920 --> 00:37:07,640

Glistening through my shirt they were my butt

amazing

548
00:44:22,220 --> 00:44:25,900
Leads incoming first years on trips into the main woods. I

549
00:44:26,740 --> 00:44:28,740
the main would not

550
00:44:28,740 --> 00:44:32,380
I marry woods, you know, what?

551
00:44:34,540 --> 00:44:37,620
Not those other words the normal woods I

552
00:44:38,540 --> 00:44:40,540
Led one of those trips last August

553
00:44:41,260 --> 00:44:43,380
However, after coming back and doing my laundry

554
00:44:43,380 --> 00:44:49,540
I realized that one of my co leaders sports bras had actually gotten mixed up with my stuff clothes

555
00:44:49,540 --> 00:44:56,220
Sometimes get misplaced among tent groups on trips about I let her know this had happened and she said she'd come and pick it up

556
00:44:56,220 --> 00:44:59,780
That was seven months ago. It has not been picked up. What do I do?

557
00:44:59,860 --> 00:45:05,240
Do I say nothing do a reminder to pick it up? If so, how have I passed the window?

558
00:45:05,240 --> 00:45:08,780
Which this could have been done painlessly. Yes, I desperately don't want to be creepy

559
00:45:08,780 --> 00:45:12,380
But I feel like any route I decided travel now would be perceived as such

560
00:45:13,420 --> 00:45:15,740
This from bra boozled in Brunswick, Maine

561
00:45:15,740 --> 00:45:21,500
And I do want to I do want to sympathize with you before we start trying to fix this because this is extremely challenging

562
00:45:21,860 --> 00:45:24,000
you did try to do the the

563
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:29,780
Responsible adult thing here, but the problem that you now face is

564
00:45:30,520 --> 00:45:35,560
You have held on to this person's bra for seven months at that because on the one hand

565
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:40,600
I know you were every day like patting it on the head as you walk out the door or something

566
00:45:40,600 --> 00:45:44,120
Well, I have kept this for a long time. Yes

567
00:45:44,560 --> 00:45:49,440
Yes, the problem is because yes, Justin you make an excellent point because I was going to say

568
00:45:49,920 --> 00:45:52,120
Like you you told them they left it there

569
00:45:52,120 --> 00:45:58,000
But but but you kept it because I don't know

570
00:45:58,520 --> 00:46:04,620
Throw it in the fucking garbage can. Yeah touch their boobs. No, no, no, it's not it's but you're not

571
00:46:05,500 --> 00:46:11,280
Immediately supposed to do that, but there was a day and I don't know how you would have divined this

572
00:46:11,440 --> 00:46:15,640
There was a day when you should have picked it up and taken it to the trash can

573
00:46:15,640 --> 00:46:20,280
I don't know what day that was though. Yeah, it wasn't seven months for certain

574
00:46:20,280 --> 00:46:27,520
It was a sir. We can all agree you've overshot. I would say definitely the change of seasons like

575
00:46:27,880 --> 00:46:29,880
like if you are I

576
00:46:30,040 --> 00:46:36,540
Know in Maine right you got seasons you're pulling out your winter wardrobe and the bras still there

577
00:46:37,080 --> 00:46:38,920
That that was the time

578
00:46:38,920 --> 00:46:42,680
that was that when you're going through and you're like time to put away the Bermuda shorts and

579
00:46:43,040 --> 00:46:48,080
Hawaiian shirts that we all have and wear a lot time to put those away and also

580
00:46:48,080 --> 00:46:53,640
But like Chuck this bra like that's the time I would say that's the sweet spot

581
00:46:54,120 --> 00:46:58,120
That's what we call that because you can't contact them again

582
00:46:58,640 --> 00:47:00,640
Yeah, oh, oh no

583
00:47:02,400 --> 00:47:07,760
Hey, I've had your bra for seven months you're gonna come get it or am I just gonna leave it on this hanger next to my

584
00:47:07,760 --> 00:47:09,760
Tuxedo

585
00:47:11,720 --> 00:47:17,360
Still here still got it. Hey, don't worry if you thought that I wouldn't cling desperately to your

586
00:47:17,360 --> 00:47:25,720
Discarded bra, I definitely am doing you can now throw it away with it because the chance that another human being will contact you

587
00:47:25,720 --> 00:47:27,640
And say hey

588
00:47:27,640 --> 00:47:32,600
Remember seven months ago when you said you have my bra you still have it, right?

589
00:47:32,800 --> 00:47:38,620
Yeah, that would be that would be wilder. I think that you're okay to after a month

590
00:47:38,620 --> 00:47:43,440
I think that you're okay to throw something away where you don't mind

591
00:47:43,440 --> 00:47:47,840
Reimbursing the dollar that that that's a get out of jail

592
00:47:47,840 --> 00:47:51,400
Like if somebody's like hey, I asked you about a bra like six months ago

593
00:47:51,400 --> 00:47:55,360
You don't still have it. The only sane answer is absolutely not like no

594
00:47:55,360 --> 00:48:01,520
There's no reality which but I would happily reimburse you for it because I did this I was entrusted with it

595
00:48:01,520 --> 00:48:05,840
Well, and I discard I disagree there Justin. I was not entrusted with it

596
00:48:05,840 --> 00:48:12,320
You fuck it got mixed up in my shit. You didn't hand me your bra say protect. Yeah, but if that person was like

597
00:48:12,320 --> 00:48:17,880
The person wasn't like drop it on the ground. Don't touch it. Meet me on a bridge

598
00:48:18,080 --> 00:48:20,360
I'll be on one side you be on the other side

599
00:48:21,600 --> 00:48:27,520
Yeah, they said I trust you with it and then every day that went past was another vote of confidence that you could handle this

600
00:48:27,920 --> 00:48:30,160
Responsibility and you will have failed it

601
00:48:30,800 --> 00:48:33,640
Because you didn't get it. Sure. Yeah, I'm worried

602
00:48:33,640 --> 00:48:38,880
We sound like three real porky boys though in this exact way this about any garment. Yeah

603
00:48:38,880 --> 00:48:41,140
Very literally about anything

604
00:48:41,760 --> 00:48:47,480
Right if someone left a book at my house and it was and seven and I said hey you left this year

605
00:48:47,480 --> 00:48:51,360
Come get it and seven months passed because here's what I'm thinking, right?

606
00:48:51,360 --> 00:48:51,840
Yeah

607
00:48:51,840 --> 00:48:57,200
I think the expiration date for lack of a better term of when you can like get rid of something is the amount of time

608
00:48:57,320 --> 00:49:03,080
Where you feel you could reasonably respond to the request to have it back with I have no idea where it is

609
00:49:03,400 --> 00:49:06,640
Right because like someone leaves your something at your house you say hey

610
00:49:06,640 --> 00:49:10,400
I found your book and two days later they come to pick it up and you say I don't know where it is

611
00:49:10,400 --> 00:49:12,780
You fucked up. Someone leaves a book at your house

612
00:49:12,780 --> 00:49:19,360
You call six months later after like life has happened and you're like I've cleaned up so many times since then

613
00:49:19,640 --> 00:49:25,560
That book could be anywhere is a fair response to it's been six months, dude

614
00:49:25,840 --> 00:49:30,020
Like I I think I'm getting really impassioned about this

615
00:49:30,020 --> 00:49:33,260
I can tell I don't know where anything in my house is at any given time

616
00:49:33,260 --> 00:49:38,620
Sure, let alone something that's not mine and I have no emotional or spiritual connection to

617
00:49:39,200 --> 00:49:42,700
Can I ask you something that like this is gonna seem weird when I initially say it

618
00:49:42,700 --> 00:49:44,740
Give it a second before you sweat it down. What about like?

619
00:49:45,620 --> 00:49:49,600
Just putting it in a bag and leaving it on their porch. Oh, that's great

620
00:49:50,100 --> 00:49:52,740
Now what kind of look at what kind of bag?

621
00:49:53,420 --> 00:49:56,020
Because the details are very important right now used

622
00:49:56,900 --> 00:50:01,380
No, no, not a used Kroger bag. That's a threat what you just described

623
00:50:01,380 --> 00:50:06,140
But I have so many of them and I care about the environment. It's like take them back to a Kroger

624
00:50:06,140 --> 00:50:10,180
They have a bag or can't reset. Do they have a bag recycler there? They could turn them into like, yeah

625
00:50:11,460 --> 00:50:14,660
Well, I keep them. I mean, I don't want I don't need to do what you're saying

626
00:50:14,660 --> 00:50:18,140
I keep them and use them for lots of stuff like threatening people with gloves

627
00:50:18,140 --> 00:50:23,420
I make makeshift gloves and boots, you know, okay. Wow for my kids

628
00:50:24,300 --> 00:50:27,940
They go so fast. They don't grow garbage bags. Yeah, that's fair

629
00:50:27,940 --> 00:50:34,340
But you just put it on and put it in a Kroger bag. No, and then you leave on a door. No

630
00:50:34,340 --> 00:50:39,940
Like what's wrong with that? It's a threat just it's not a threat Travis. What are they threatening it?

631
00:50:39,940 --> 00:50:43,660
Why would it be a threat? It feels somehow because okay

632
00:50:43,660 --> 00:50:49,100
I feel like sometimes we blow past Travis's bad idea so fast that he's not forced to

633
00:50:50,420 --> 00:50:52,420
Reinforce it. So speak on this

634
00:50:52,420 --> 00:50:58,100
Threat because after seven months the chance that this person is forgotten that you have their sports was very high

635
00:50:58,220 --> 00:51:01,780
So now and I'm assuming here you're not leaving a note incorrect

636
00:51:02,100 --> 00:51:06,740
Okay, but the possibility that they have forgotten is there you they have forgotten?

637
00:51:06,740 --> 00:51:13,220
Yes, you hang the bra in a bag. They open the door. It's there

638
00:51:14,100 --> 00:51:17,540
someone has left an article of clothing that

639
00:51:17,540 --> 00:51:25,300
They might remember is theirs on the doorknob in a bag a plastic bag and it's just a loose bra in there

640
00:51:25,620 --> 00:51:32,440
No, they see the brothel immediately you are assuming that now a hundred percent. I feel very okay

641
00:51:33,540 --> 00:51:38,680
Remember Justin and then it will be weird. You're right. You'll be weird hearing you lay it out like that. I realize

642
00:51:38,680 --> 00:51:45,120
Okay, bring bring Tom did you did you you know?

643
00:51:45,120 --> 00:51:51,740
I remember now that I thought about did you just come and without like ringing the doorbell and just handing it to me?

644
00:51:51,840 --> 00:51:58,660
You left it in a used Kroger bag hanging from the doorknob for me to find the next time I went to exit my do

645
00:51:58,660 --> 00:52:00,080
You hate me?

646
00:52:00,080 --> 00:52:06,400
What about this? What if you say hey, I'm moving and I'm getting packed up and I ran across this old bra of yours

647
00:52:06,400 --> 00:52:10,120
And they brought back so many great memories. I didn't mean to keep it. I

648
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:17,120
Promise I just didn't throw it away. I found it in my roommate's room. He's a real creep. No, it's not creepy

649
00:52:17,120 --> 00:52:19,520
It's just like do you want the bra? Do you want it back?

650
00:52:20,160 --> 00:52:22,040
It's no big deal. It could be yours

651
00:52:22,040 --> 00:52:25,320
It could be I think that the window if they wanted it back

652
00:52:25,800 --> 00:52:32,120
They would have come and gone what I'm saying is you have to invent a fiction where you've encountered the bra again

653
00:52:32,120 --> 00:52:37,800
Yes, you don't move there. You are old friend. It's a lie. No, you're not moving up a new place

654
00:52:39,800 --> 00:52:45,680
Father couldn't swing it. Yeah unpacked everything opened up underneath it. You probably heard about it in the new you didn't hear about it

655
00:52:45,680 --> 00:52:47,680
Oh, you might hear about it tomorrow. I gotta go

656
00:52:49,240 --> 00:52:51,500
I actually get an early edition. So

657
00:52:54,400 --> 00:52:58,240
Yeah, I get I get early edition so I'm thinking of a sinkhole tomorrow

658
00:52:58,240 --> 00:52:59,760
I gotta go

659
00:52:59,760 --> 00:53:06,960
Hit me that shovel. I got like prevent it or whatever. Where's your car parked? Yeah, you should move it cuz that's sinkhole country

660
00:53:06,960 --> 00:53:09,420
I was gonna move across the street. Bye

661
00:53:10,340 --> 00:53:12,340
Do you think he's ever like?

662
00:53:12,920 --> 00:53:16,320
Okay, are you early edition early edition?

663
00:53:16,320 --> 00:53:23,240
It'll be so cool because you can do this and then you can put it like pretty high. It's Justin. Hey, Justin

664
00:53:23,680 --> 00:53:25,680
This is the newspaper. Okay, cool

665
00:53:25,680 --> 00:53:31,000
Um, can you put in a classified ad that said hey Justin it was weird with the bra

666
00:53:31,480 --> 00:53:36,400
Don't just forget about it and throw it in the trash. So that's who you want the classified. I have to say yeah

667
00:53:36,600 --> 00:53:38,600
Yeah, yeah, put it in the paper

668
00:53:38,600 --> 00:53:45,640
Okay, and then you would get it that more. Yeah. Oh, you've hacked the early edition conundrum, right?

669
00:53:45,640 --> 00:53:53,080
Yeah, you really on early edition. They never showed him like looking at the sales ads and it's like, ah tomorrow

670
00:53:53,080 --> 00:53:56,760
It's various. Oh, look at this with a winning lot. Oh, come on. No

671
00:53:57,680 --> 00:54:02,160
Fisher Stevens always wanted to use the winning lot of numbers. Oh, but then

672
00:54:03,040 --> 00:54:09,040
Kyle from Friday Night Lights knew that if he did that then he would lose access to the paper

673
00:54:09,720 --> 00:54:11,720
at most he would do like

674
00:54:12,360 --> 00:54:16,080
Here's a solution to yesterday's. Yeah, and he'd be like a size

675
00:54:17,080 --> 00:54:20,800
On my phone that the last listener stopped the show

676
00:54:20,800 --> 00:54:22,240
Hey

00:54:32,360 --> 00:54:39,080
Okay. Okay, Jeremy Piven in that originally a rock block of rebooted Fantasy Island. Yeah, let's first

680
00:54:39,080 --> 00:54:43,400
So you're saying as long as yeah, I mean, I guess if nobody's listening we can talk about all the

681
00:54:44,200 --> 00:54:48,760
Bathroom you want Jeremy Piven to start in the bathroom right now a bit. I'm going I know

682
00:54:48,760 --> 00:54:53,600
I don't want Jeremy Piven to be in it again. He wasn't in it when they were you be rebooted at the first time

683
00:54:53,600 --> 00:54:56,100
Oh, what was the one Gryphon with the dude who?

688
00:55:17,220 --> 00:55:23,020
But he like what but like a kick-ass John candy. Hey, so let's wrap up the show while Justin's gone

689
00:55:24,580 --> 00:55:30,460
