1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:30,800
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:46,640
Hello everybody, welcome to my brother, my brother made it,

6
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:49,920
vice show for the modern era of breaking news, I'm Justin McElroy.

7
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:51,920
Wait, is that the breaking news? I'm Travis McElroy.

8
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:54,080
Now I'm setting people up for breaking news.

9
00:00:54,080 --> 00:00:55,280
Oh, it's a teaser.

10
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:58,720
We've got our lead video game correspondent, Travis McElroy.

11
00:00:58,720 --> 00:01:00,720
I'm Griffin McElroy.

12
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:04,640
Travis, report in, lead video game expert and correspondent, Travis McElroy.

13
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:06,240
What's the news in video games?

14
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:13,200
So I think Bill Gates is playing Minecraft now. Hold on, let me read the story.

15
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:18,000
He just joined my son's server, and he won't stop stealing all the diamonds.

16
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:23,760
It looks like, oh yep, okay, so it looks like they're gonna buy Minecraft.

17
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:28,640
You can't buy, you can't buy Minecraft, it's a world of infinite freedom

18
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:30,800
and exploration and imagination, you can't.

19
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:34,080
Yeah, don't be ridiculous, you need like 2.5 billion dollars.

20
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:36,560
I'm gonna buy all the rainbows in the world.

21
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:40,720
Oh, it looks like Bill Gates sneezed and accidentally bought Minecraft.

22
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:43,440
Yeah, it's like trying to buy all the world's wishes.

23
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:44,560
Yeah, we can't do that.

24
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:46,480
He did that too, he did that in 2010.

25
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:48,400
For two billion, a clean two billion.

26
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:52,240
I wonder why my dreams died, I thought that was connected to turn of 30,

27
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:54,240
but apparently Bill Gates bought my dreams.

28
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:57,840
It's the energy by which he sustains his life now.

29
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:02,080
But now he's using voxels, a voxel-based imagination engine.

30
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:04,000
Fucking thanks for that Bill, Bill G.

31
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:11,600
I've long suspected that the rich are not concerned about global warming

32
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:16,720
because they have another, they have an escape plan that they're not telling us about,

33
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:19,440
that's why they're accumulating that vast wealth

34
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:25,120
to make an ark from which to leave the earth and possibly the solar system.

35
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:32,000
Do you think that Minecraft is actually the vehicle

36
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:38,400
by which the world's rich are going to exit this planet?

37
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:41,680
They're going to basically join the mind stream.

38
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:46,320
Hold on, are you talking like toys level shit?

39
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:50,400
Where like we all think it's a game but really we're terraforming a far off planet

40
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:55,200
and it's all real or they're going to like matrix into the Minecraft world?

41
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:55,840
They're matrixing into Minecraft.

42
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:58,080
Which weird movie are you referencing?

43
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:01,520
What I'm saying is that my, I'm not, this is completely from my mind.

44
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:03,280
This is like from my mind's eye.

45
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:13,920
I think that America and the world's rich are going to download their ego into Minecraft

46
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:18,320
and that will become the new utopia of the rich.

47
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:21,120
So more like Captain Inn or more like-

48
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:25,040
Stop trying to fucking put my genius in a pop culture box.

49
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:26,800
I just wanna know, is it like Cool World?

50
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:27,280
Like what are we looking at?

51
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:28,800
It's nothing like Cool World.

52
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:31,440
It's kind of like Cool World.

53
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:32,800
It's kind of like Cool World.

54
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:35,600
Are we talking about a snow dog situation?

55
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:39,280
Are we talking about a snow dog situation?

56
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:40,320
What about Out to Sea?

57
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:44,160
Okay, have you seen A Walk Among the Clouds?

58
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:44,560
Uh-huh.

59
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:46,000
I've seen Boat Trip.

60
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:48,400
Okay, have you seen Boat Trip?

61
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:50,640
With Kuba Gooding Jr.

62
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:52,480
Okay, it's like that.

63
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:53,360
It's kind of like that.

64
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:54,720
It's kind of like that.

65
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:56,640
Straight talk.

66
00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:01,920
This is the fucking dumbest and worst thing ever $2.5 billion for a 300 year old game.

67
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:03,200
Why didn't they email me?

68
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:05,680
Hey Griffin, can we get you to sign off on this one?

69
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:07,200
Ooh, 2.5 million.

70
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:08,560
Yeah, that's not a bad idea.

71
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:10,320
Sorry, dog, reread that letter.

72
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:13,520
Oh no, that's far too much money, Bill Gates.

73
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:15,600
Hey Griffin, is it 2007?

74
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:17,040
Should we buy Minecraft?

75
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:18,640
Is it 1991?

76
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:19,840
Notch was just born.

77
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:22,960
I'm going to buy his product ahead of time for $2.5 hundred.

78
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:24,880
Sounds great.

79
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:26,000
That's a great decision.

80
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:27,600
That's a great decision.

81
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:28,720
It's called the ground floor.

82
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:37,600
You are on a spaceship overlooking the building because that building is a billion years old.

83
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:42,880
And you just spent $2 for every year that that game has been on the earth.

84
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:45,120
Bring it to a scale we can all understand, right?

85
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:53,680
My maximum fund scooped up my brother, my brother and me, the brand in April of 2011.

86
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:54,960
For $750 million.

87
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:56,160
For $750 million.

88
00:04:56,960 --> 00:05:01,520
If they came to us now with $750 million, I would spit in Jesse Thorn's face.

89
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:02,480
I would spit in his face.

90
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:05,440
I would say, look at who you're talking to.

91
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:06,480
Mm hmm.

92
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:08,560
Bring the car around, right?

93
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:13,200
Like, I would, but because we're, I mean, I'm massive.

94
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:14,400
I guess massive would be the word.

95
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:18,160
But what Microsoft has done, Microsoft did the equivalent of coming to my brother, my

96
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:24,720
brother and me in two thousand two hundred and eleven and trying to buy the property.

97
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:28,240
When we're more of a religion, wild science-esque religion.

98
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:32,240
Yeah, we're just, our energies are contained within crystals.

99
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:36,480
You light a magic torch behind it and we are projected into the world and then we say some

100
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:37,360
shit about a horse.

101
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:40,880
Uh, no, it's really bad.

102
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:46,240
I don't have a video game podcast anymore, so I'll just have to tell you, to my brother,

103
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:48,640
my brother and me audience, that's a crazy thing.

104
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:49,280
Yeah.

105
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:55,040
It would be like coming to the Beatles now and saying, I want to sign the deal.

106
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:59,200
I just played, I played the Beatles rock band and I, I had never heard of you guys before,

107
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:03,040
but I love your stuff, so I will need to buy all of you.

108
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:04,320
I mean, that is what Apple did.

109
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:05,920
Apple did do that.

110
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:08,960
Uh, bad businesses.

111
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:10,640
Apple did that to you, too, though.

112
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:11,920
I feel bad for you, too.

113
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:16,960
Apple, Apple went to you, too, and said, we'll give, is any man gonna buy your new album?

114
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:19,600
And you two said, oh, Blimey, probably not, Gov.

115
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:25,680
And then, uh, uh, Steve Jobs Jr., the new president was like, uh, what if we gave it,

116
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:27,520
what if we forced everybody to take it?

117
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:29,200
Oh, Gov, Blimey, that'd be great.

118
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:30,240
You'll have to give us some money.

119
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:31,040
How many dollars?

120
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:31,760
Catorce.

121
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:34,240
Fourteen dollars?

122
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:36,720
I was never quite clear on that, right?

123
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:37,520
How about a hundred?

124
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:43,120
I thought catorce was just like a number and you can make it mean whatever you want it to mean.

125
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:44,560
No, it's Spanish for 14.

126
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:48,160
Like, you know, like supercalifragilisticexpialidocious, right?

127
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:53,600
You just count up, it's like one, two, three, and then a number that can mean any number.

128
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:55,520
Higher than three, right?

129
00:06:55,520 --> 00:07:02,160
The first iPod I ever owned was a secondhand U2 themed iPod that came with discography on the iPod.

130
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:04,560
Yeah, they've been sucking that tea for a long, long time.

131
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:06,800
Should we, uh, do advice?

132
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:08,960
Yeah, don't buy Minecraft.

133
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:10,000
Don't buy Minecraft.

134
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:10,800
I mean, buy the game.

135
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:11,760
It's a great game.

136
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:14,960
Don't buy the game because you don't have to buy the game because it's free.

137
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:16,800
You paid 2.5 million dollars.

138
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:18,240
That's a horrible business model.

139
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:21,440
I'm gonna buy McDonald's and also they give burgers away for free.

140
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:22,880
Overhead.

141
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:23,760
Who cares?

142
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:24,560
Who gives a shit?

143
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:25,360
Who gives a shit?

144
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:25,860
Questions.

145
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:28,160
Questions.

146
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:33,760
I've been happily married for two years, but I could not come up with a passable way to address

147
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:34,800
my mother-in-law.

148
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:38,800
I know people usually call their mother-in-law mom or mother or just call her by this name,

149
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:39,840
but it kind of freaks me out.

150
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:42,960
Due to this situation, I usually avoid addressing her directly,

151
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,640
which requires a good amount of effort in social gatherings.

152
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:51,040
I try not to call her out directly, e.g. if we're on the same dinner table and she has the salt

153
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:56,480
shaker in front of her, I would do without the salt shaker for that entire meal.

154
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:57,600
That is cool.

155
00:07:57,600 --> 00:08:01,440
She's like a server standing just looming over the salt shaker.

156
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:02,480
Can I get the salt?

157
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:03,280
Uh, nevermind.

158
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:06,720
Hey, why do you always have gravy on your sleeves?

159
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:08,960
Well, it's because I'm a far reacher.

160
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:11,840
How can I overcome this problem, brothers?

161
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:12,720
And there's a name here.

162
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:15,840
Patrasche just put this person's real name and that's not what we do.

163
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:19,600
Especially not in this situation.

164
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:24,080
We'll call them, we'll call them naughty in Nebraska.

165
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:25,120
Naughty in Nebraska.

166
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:25,440
Fine.

167
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:28,320
Probably doesn't have anything to do with their question.

168
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:31,680
That's the best nomenclature in Nome, Alaska.

169
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:33,680
Horny and Corpus Christi.

170
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:37,280
What do you guys call your mother-in-law's?

171
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:38,480
Linda.

172
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:39,840
Justin.

173
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:42,400
Uh, you know, I've been,

174
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:46,480
I've been getting more into mom.

175
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:48,240
I've been saying mom more often.

176
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:52,320
I found myself saying mom more often just because we've been family for a long time.

177
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:54,400
It seems weird to say Mary.

178
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:55,440
Let me ask you this.

179
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:56,000
Since-

180
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,920
It was a pretty natural thing that it's something I forged.

181
00:08:57,920 --> 00:08:59,040
It just seemed-

182
00:08:59,040 --> 00:08:59,600
Yeah.

183
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:01,520
Since baby Chuck, did that evolve?

184
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:05,440
Like, did she take on a grandmother type name from you?

185
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:06,480
I've heard that before.

186
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:10,800
No, I mean, probably as Chuck's older, I need to talk to Chuck now.

187
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:12,480
I don't need to talk to Chuck at all.

188
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:14,800
Some people talk to her and I'm like, she doesn't get it.

189
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:15,360
That's weird.

190
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:16,640
Stop wasting your breath.

191
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:23,120
But like, I, no, I mean, it just sort of happened over time.

192
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:26,960
I will admit, like, the first time it has to be like a conscious decision, I think.

193
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:32,400
Like, I'm gonna say this now and it's gonna be kind of weird, but I'm just gonna like go for it.

194
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:35,440
And then after that, like, it wasn't that strange.

195
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:38,720
I mean, sometimes I say mom, sometimes I say Mary.

196
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:41,760
It just kind of depends on the situation.

197
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:44,720
Can I hit you guys with something I've been thinking about?

198
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:45,440
Yeah.

199
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:50,400
Why don't you just call, if you've got a mother-in-law or a father-in-law, just call them law.

200
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:53,280
Just call them law.

201
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:54,320
And like, you could use it.

202
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:57,840
It's gender neutral and you can just use it whenever you want.

203
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:01,920
And I think, I mean, it sounds tight if someone was like, hey, law.

204
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:04,720
And I'd be like, yes, that's me.

205
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:05,680
I am the law.

206
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:06,480
Thank you for saying that.

207
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:09,200
You could go with like law mom and law dad.

208
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:10,480
Nope, you can't.

209
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:12,240
Just law, but doesn't that get confusing?

210
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:13,920
It's like, wait, me law or her law?

211
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:16,480
No, it's context sensitive, Travis.

212
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:21,200
You don't always have to explicitly say who the subject of any sentence is.

213
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:23,360
People are smart enough to figure it out.

214
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:26,160
It's like when you say you, that can mean like anybody.

215
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:30,400
Or when you say Linda and you're in a room with a few Lindas in it.

216
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:31,840
Maybe you're at a Linda convention.

217
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:34,400
Maybe you're at LindaCon 2014.

218
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:34,960
Exactly.

219
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:40,560
Maybe you're the hired entertainment and maybe you should have practiced your songs a little bit.

220
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:44,800
Hi, I'm Linda Ronstadt and thank you for bringing me here.

221
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:47,280
I'm a Linda Ronstadt cover, Linda non-stat.

222
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:52,320
Are there any Lindas in the house tonight?

223
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:54,240
Lindas, let me hear you.

224
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:56,320
You know what name I really like is Linda.

225
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:59,200
It sure is great to be back in Corpus Christi, Texas.

226
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:05,040
This is a tough one.

227
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:09,600
I mean, I just, I have dropped the honorifics almost entirely for my life

228
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:16,000
because people have names for a reason and it's just to let you know where they fit

229
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:19,520
in the great big old filing cabinet we call the earth.

230
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:20,400
Isn't that right, guys?

231
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:23,840
But I think the best advice is to ask her.

232
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:26,720
Be like, hey, oh, that's a cool conversation.

233
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:27,840
Can I call you mom?

234
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:32,560
That's not a fucking relationship bender.

235
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:34,560
Make sure you're covered in-

236
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:35,760
Excuse me.

237
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:37,760
Can I, excuse me.

238
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:39,440
You're on your knees pulling her apron.

239
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:40,800
You're covered in food.

240
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:42,560
Can I call you mommy?

241
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:43,760
Yeah.

242
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:48,080
Well, I mean, I thought this was kind of a throw it at the wall,

243
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:51,520
see what sticks kind of conversation, but I didn't know you guys already had the answer.

244
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:53,920
We don't have the answer.

245
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:58,720
Listen, a lot of times on this show, you've been a part of this program for a long time now,

246
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:00,800
Travis, you should know that we don't always have the answers,

247
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:04,720
but we do know the absolute wrongest answer.

248
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:07,200
And I believe that you certainly got the square right.

249
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:09,600
Well, let me, okay, so let me take another shot of this.

250
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:10,080
Okay.

251
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:15,520
If you're at a point where you're not sure, then you should just call her by her name.

252
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:17,680
Do you know her name?

253
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:19,840
That is actually decent advice.

254
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:23,840
Because, I mean, right now, I think it's like saying I love you.

255
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:28,560
If you're not ready to call her mom or mother or anything like that, then don't do it.

256
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:30,880
Because it's not at that point yet.

257
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:34,560
I would say two years seems like a long time,

258
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:37,920
but in the grand scheme of things, it's still pretty new.

259
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:41,840
I honestly just got to a point where my mother-in-law had done me so many solids

260
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:46,960
over our time together as relatives that if I didn't start calling her mom,

261
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:48,880
I was going to start feeling really guilty.

262
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:49,520
Yeah.

263
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:51,520
Like, listen, you cannot be married anymore.

264
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:56,080
You have like brought me, you've brought a McDonald's breakfast to the hospital like

265
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:57,760
seven days in a row for me.

266
00:12:57,760 --> 00:12:59,920
So I'm just promoting you to mom.

267
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:00,880
Congratulations.

268
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:04,880
Do you guys want a Yahoo?

269
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:05,440
Yes.

270
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:06,480
You didn't answer.

271
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:06,720
Yeah.

272
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:07,200
Sorry.

273
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:07,440
I do.

274
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:08,240
I was thinking about it.

275
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:10,880
You asked and I figured.

276
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:13,840
Just across the board, we got really good questions this week.

277
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:14,080
Okay.

278
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:15,680
I really love them.

279
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:18,480
Thanks for ruining the surprise.

280
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:18,800
Okay.

281
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,920
This Yahoo was sent in by Scuba Steve,

282
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:25,040
and it's, I think, a pretty great transition off the last question.

283
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:34,320
And that's by Yahoo Answers user Tony, who asks, is memory foam bad for sex?

284
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:40,080
Thinking of getting either a memory foam mattress or a topper.

285
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:40,640
Update.

286
00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:43,920
Also, I mean, good sex, not boring sex.

287
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:45,440
Thanks for any insight.

288
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:50,320
Oh, well, I'm quite clarified because memory foam is great for boring sex.

289
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:57,280
I mean, I don't want to show my hand, but I make love like I'm slowly being absorbed by quicksand.

290
00:13:58,320 --> 00:13:59,280
I don't want.

291
00:13:59,280 --> 00:14:00,160
I don't want.

292
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:00,960
Here's the problem.

293
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:03,920
You can use a memory foam mattress.

294
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:06,000
It'll make sex better.

295
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:11,760
But only if you get a memory foam mattress after you've been having sex for a while.

296
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:15,520
Because if you have sex for the first few times on a memory foam mattress,

297
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:18,000
and then later you're still having sex on it,

298
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,880
you're going to look at those previous indentations and think,

299
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:23,280
ugh, what was I doing?

300
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:24,880
Memory foam remembers.

301
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:26,160
Don't remember that.

302
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:28,080
What's with all the elbow imprints?

303
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:30,800
What was I doing?

304
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:33,680
The weird thing is when you plug your memory foam into your computer

305
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:35,840
and you download all of the information

306
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:38,800
and it gives you all the stats off of your previous lovemaking sessions.

307
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:40,000
Yeah.

308
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:41,680
Hey, it's me, Clippy.

309
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:43,280
Good number of pumps there, Trout.

310
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:46,080
You want me to keep track of your pumps?

311
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:47,600
It's me, Clippy.

312
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:50,400
I'll track your pumps for you, Trout.

313
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:52,160
Hey, have you tried Minecraft?

314
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:54,880
What if it's-

315
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:58,240
I see you added a swerve, Trout.

316
00:14:58,240 --> 00:14:59,280
That's fantastic.

317
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:02,320
You need to see a doctor, Trout.

318
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:04,320
We can take the virus alerts.

319
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:07,360
Hey, Trout, you need to compensate for the angle, Trout.

320
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:08,480
You know what I'm talking about.

321
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:10,960
You need to run a McCaffrey virus check, buddy.

322
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:14,640
Can't help but notice not cuddling afterwards, you jackass.

323
00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:21,040
What if he ran it and his erect penis had a red squiggly line underneath it?

324
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:25,040
Oh, boy.

325
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:27,760
You spelled oh incorrectly.

326
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:36,320
I mean, none of us own a memory foam, right?

327
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:38,960
I know that we're making a lot of-

328
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:42,720
I know we're making a lot of money on this show, but not that Minecraft money.

329
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:44,720
No.

330
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:51,680
It seems to me, though, like it wouldn't be ideal unless for some reason while you fuck,

331
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:57,360
you like to have glasses of wine all around you that you don't want to spill over onto yourself.

332
00:15:58,080 --> 00:16:05,280
It's so funny to me because it seems like 40 years ago, the thing was like water,

333
00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:07,040
you know, water mattresses.

334
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:07,200
Yeah.

335
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:07,840
What are those called?

336
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:08,400
Water beds.

337
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:09,040
Water beds.

338
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:12,880
Which is like the polar opposite of memory foam.

339
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:15,520
Memory foam is like, oh, you can like bounce a bowling ball and nothing happens.

340
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:17,920
And like a water bed is like, oh, you moved your elbow

341
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:20,080
and you flipped the other person out of the bed.

342
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:20,320
Yeah.

343
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:26,000
Well, I think that making love, when you make love in a memory foam,

344
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:33,360
you are nullifying a lot of the earth's natural physics and effects

345
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:39,440
and a lot of the simple machines featured in a traditional mattress.

346
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:44,160
And I think that, I mean, I love extreme restraints,

347
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:47,920
but I get by with those simple machines.

348
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:48,480
You know what I mean?

349
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:50,240
Springs, levers.

350
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:50,720
Screws.

351
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:52,000
Thank you.

352
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:55,040
Inclined planes, things like that.

353
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:58,880
And in a memory foam, you are floating in the negative zone.

354
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:00,320
You know what I mean?

355
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:02,640
You are imprisoned in the negative zone.

356
00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:04,800
And you and Zod making love.

357
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:05,600
Making love.

358
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:07,520
And that can be pleasurable.

359
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:08,800
Kneel before Zod.

360
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:13,840
But I don't think it works for everyone.

361
00:17:15,040 --> 00:17:18,000
But isn't that true of all lovemaking, Griffin?

362
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:21,360
Maybe one man's memory foam is another man's sleep number bed.

363
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:26,160
Is another man's inflatable camping mattress.

364
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:33,680
Sleep number bed would be great because I have always wanted a fuck number.

365
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:36,160
That's something they do not feature in the advertisements.

366
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:38,400
But you say, what's your sleep number?

367
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:38,880
28.

368
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:40,160
What's your fuck number?

369
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:41,600
35.

370
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:43,280
Yes.

371
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:45,680
And then someone's like, is that the number of people you've slept with?

372
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:48,000
And it's like, no, that number is zero.

373
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:55,040
I just know my fuck number in preparation for that special day.

374
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:56,640
They find that for you in the store.

375
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:58,560
That number is zero and looking.

376
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:00,720
Ladies.

377
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:01,920
Zero plus.

378
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:03,520
And then you say, why is it zero?

379
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:05,520
And he says, true love waits.

380
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:07,760
And it was a commercial for true love waits the whole time.

381
00:18:08,560 --> 00:18:09,280
Okay, guys.

382
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:10,160
Marry, fuck, kill.

383
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:11,280
Are you ready?

384
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:13,200
Sleep number.

385
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:13,520
Yeah.

386
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:14,320
Memory foam.

387
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:14,640
Yeah.

388
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:16,240
Craftmatic adjustable.

389
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:17,040
Oh, my God.

390
00:18:17,040 --> 00:18:25,360
I didn't kill the craftmatic just because it would kill you, I think, to try and make

391
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:27,200
that two back piece up on that.

392
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:28,560
You get fold up like a panini.

393
00:18:30,560 --> 00:18:31,760
The sexiest panini.

394
00:18:32,560 --> 00:18:35,840
Did you see someone did that with us in the Facebook group?

395
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:37,600
I asked them.

396
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:38,480
Did I win?

397
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:39,040
Did I win?

398
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:41,120
Nobody won.

399
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:42,240
It was the worst.

400
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:45,360
I often crash on friends' couches because I don't like driving drunk.

401
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:46,320
Good for you.

402
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:50,080
My friends are always cool with this because they'd rather me crash at their place than

403
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:53,200
into another car or in a jail or into a jail.

404
00:18:54,560 --> 00:18:57,760
My issue with this is that I can't sleep with pants on.

405
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:03,920
I usually get under a blanket, slip off my pants, sleep in just a shirt and undies.

406
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:05,280
My question is this.

407
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:07,840
Am I making myself too at home when I do this?

408
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:11,120
Or is this okay as long as I don't walk around their home in my undies?

409
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:15,280
That's from sleepless when I have pants on in Birmingham, Alabama.

410
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:18,160
Oh my God, I have done this move.

411
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:18,800
I know.

412
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:19,280
Oh me?

413
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:20,160
I'm a gentleman.

414
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:21,600
I'm sleeping in my pants.

415
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:28,160
As soon as the lights are off, the covers are on, those pants are outskis.

416
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:31,520
Can we talk about Bachelor in Paradise?

417
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:32,240
Just for a second.

418
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:35,600
Just for like, give me 45 seconds to please talk about that.

419
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:37,520
You get a 45 second visa.

420
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:41,600
In the finale, there is this couple, Sarah and Robert.

421
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:46,000
There is this couple, Sarah and Robert, and you could tell that Robert wasn't feeling it.

422
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:50,720
I think he just liked that good Paradise scene.

423
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:53,920
He liked being a part of the beach scene.

424
00:19:55,040 --> 00:19:58,640
They went to the fantasy suite on their last day there and nothing happened.

425
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:03,440
I knew that it was a whole situation because Sarah was like,

426
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:05,280
yeah, Robert slept in the bed with me.

427
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:07,040
He never took his jeans off.

428
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:09,280
I was like, that's not love.

429
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:10,800
That's not intimacy.

430
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:12,960
That is what a murderer does.

431
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:16,240
Nobody can be comfortable in jeans.

432
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:17,840
Nobody can be comfortable in jeans.

433
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:23,840
If you're doing this frequently enough that you had to write into a comedy

434
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:28,080
advice podcast to ask us about it, maybe you need to start carrying like a little

435
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:31,120
overnight bag with you when you go to parties at friends houses

436
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:33,200
and take some like comfy sleep pants.

437
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:35,680
Yeah, that's the secret that I have.

438
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:37,680
I bring sleep shorts with me.

439
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:39,440
Where?

440
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:40,080
What?

441
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:41,360
Because he's everywhere he goes.

442
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:42,560
He's got everywhere.

443
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:46,000
Well, if I'm going to be sleeping in another locale, I bring sleep shorts.

444
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:50,800
So, you know, like, I don't think I basically bring huge basketball shorts.

445
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:56,480
He's he's I don't think he's ever planning on sleeping at the maybe you need.

446
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:57,040
I got it.

447
00:20:57,040 --> 00:20:57,520
I got it.

448
00:20:57,520 --> 00:20:58,080
I got it.

449
00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:02,240
You don't want to carry a fucking gym bag around with you to the to the bars.

450
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:03,040
You know what I mean?

451
00:21:03,040 --> 00:21:09,920
But you can sew your seeds of comfortable pants at all of the houses of your friends

452
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:13,520
that you think you are going to pass out at.

453
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:16,560
Oh, like a hide a key like you bury it in the yard.

454
00:21:16,560 --> 00:21:22,160
Yeah, you're going to get probably pay a nominal fee for this service of rent for your shorts.

455
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:26,720
And then you place that strategically at a dozen locations.

456
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:30,800
You know, fuck, I'm I'm real, real fucked up.

457
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:33,120
I'm going to go to sleep, but I can't.

458
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:34,160
I've got my jeans on.

459
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:38,720
And they'll be like, Don't worry, Bryce, because you planned for this.

460
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:40,240
You planted this pants seed.

461
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:43,280
And now you get to reap the sweet rewards of it.

462
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:48,480
You change into those comfy, dry shorts and you feel the breeze on your legs and you sleep.

463
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:49,920
You sleep the sleep angels.

464
00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:53,920
Sometimes I just go full nude.

465
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:54,880
No, you don't.

466
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:55,840
No, no, you don't.

467
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:56,720
You would never.

468
00:21:56,720 --> 00:21:57,280
You wouldn't.

469
00:21:57,280 --> 00:21:58,080
And you haven't.

470
00:21:58,080 --> 00:21:59,600
Don't lie to be cool.

471
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:04,160
Well, you've been in you have both been in hotel rooms with me where you have seen me

472
00:22:04,160 --> 00:22:06,400
go to bed as a shorts clad gentleman.

473
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:11,200
You son of a bitch, that was a place of trust.

474
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:14,000
That was a place of belief and safety.

475
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:18,560
I'm sorry, Justin, but that's a huge difference between being in a hotel room that you've

476
00:22:18,560 --> 00:22:23,840
paid to be in and just go and commando on your friend's couch where he also watches.

477
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:26,880
I don't know, Bachelor in Paradise, it sounds like.

478
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:28,800
Yeah, that's weird.

479
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:30,000
That's weird.

480
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,040
Is it worse or better?

481
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:32,640
Worse.

482
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:33,840
It's 100 times worse.

483
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:35,120
What I did was worse.

484
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:35,680
No.

485
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:37,360
Balls on the couch is worse.

486
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:41,520
So you're more you're very, very comfortable with my naked body, is what you're saying.

487
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:46,480
You're very, very, very comfortable with Justin.

488
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:52,720
At this point, yes, I mean, I've grown up with it.

489
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:54,240
It's 30 years in the making.

490
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:54,640
Yeah.

491
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:58,400
When I look at your naked body, Justin, on Reddit.

492
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:00,960
Thank you.

493
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:06,320
When I look at your Reddit nudes, I basically I just feel like I'm looking at my body.

494
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:07,040
You know what I mean?

495
00:23:07,040 --> 00:23:13,440
Like genetically, like it's it's that's those are my that's my scrotum.

496
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:15,120
Say it.

497
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:15,680
Say the word.

498
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:17,520
Finish it.

499
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:18,800
It's my scrotum, basically.

500
00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:20,720
I can't stress enough.

501
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:28,720
This is triply not OK if you're in either briefs or really loose fitting boxers.

502
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:33,760
Now that's drunk passed out on our friend's couch in briefs is not the best scene.

503
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:39,760
I think I think boxers is a is a horse of a different color compared.

504
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:42,480
I'm talking those loose fitting, like really thin.

505
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:44,960
There's nothing keeping the fly together ones.

506
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:46,160
You're in boxer briefs.

507
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:46,960
You've got it.

508
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:50,480
You got full coverage and it's almost like you're wearing tiny shorts.

509
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:51,280
Exactly.

510
00:23:51,280 --> 00:23:55,120
I want to actually can I bring up a related underwear issue?

511
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:58,720
And I'm hoping that either you guys or listeners can help me with this.

512
00:23:59,280 --> 00:24:02,800
When I buy boxers and I wear boxers from excuse me.

513
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:08,960
When I wear boxers, I like the boxers that have like stretch to them,

514
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:13,600
like are a fabric that has some flexibility and stretching.

515
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:20,640
And I keep buying boxers that don't have that that are just like a solid,

516
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:24,160
stiff fabric with no flex or stretch.

517
00:24:24,160 --> 00:24:25,520
And I don't know how to avoid it.

518
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:29,920
Is there some sort of language that I should be looking for on the packaging

519
00:24:29,920 --> 00:24:33,440
that tells me that I'm getting the kind of boxers I like?

520
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:34,480
Am I alone here?

521
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:38,240
You got to look at what the material is.

522
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:39,840
Well, now you look at what I'm looking for,

523
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:42,880
because I bought a hundred percent cotton that are both swung both ways.

524
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:46,960
There should be a sticker on the package somewhere that describes its viscousness rating.

525
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,040
That is true.

526
00:24:49,040 --> 00:24:50,160
I've never seen that.

527
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:51,440
Where are you buying these shorts again?

528
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:54,240
Again, everywhere we're online.

529
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:55,760
I thought maybe paying.

530
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:59,920
I thought maybe like the cheap ones were the ones that didn't have any sort of stretch to them.

531
00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:00,640
No, no, no.

532
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:03,120
It's like sometimes you could buy expensive ones that don't have any stretch.

533
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:04,320
Go to Target.

534
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:05,520
They bind.

535
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:06,240
Go to Target.

536
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:12,080
They'll let you just take one out of the package and then you throw it at the wall

537
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:16,720
and then tell me, call me when that happens and I'll tell you where to go from there.

538
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:18,320
Okay, good.

539
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:20,400
If you don't mind, I'm going to get you on the horn beforehand,

540
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:23,200
just because I don't want to get into a situation where

541
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:26,880
I'm just a guy throwing underwear at a wall and not a guy throwing underwear at a wall and talking.

542
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:29,120
Well, not any wall at the underwear wall.

543
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:29,360
Yeah.

544
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:30,320
Oh, okay.

545
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:31,280
There's a wall.

546
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:33,040
Listen, there's going to be a wall in Target.

547
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:35,680
You're fucking 42 years old.

548
00:25:35,680 --> 00:25:37,120
How do you not know this?

549
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:39,840
How do you not know about underwear walls and viscousness ratings?

550
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:40,720
See your first day.

551
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:41,280
Read a book.

552
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:46,480
Have you been living with uncomfortable genitals your whole time here on earth?

553
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:49,040
I'm going to check my underwear right now.

554
00:25:49,040 --> 00:25:49,440
Okay.

555
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:50,480
No, they're binding.

556
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:51,040
They're binding.

557
00:25:51,040 --> 00:25:51,280
Okay.

558
00:25:51,280 --> 00:25:52,080
These are binding.

559
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:52,400
Okay.

560
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:53,760
Oh, I hate that.

561
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:56,080
I would be uncomfortable with that level of detail,

562
00:25:56,080 --> 00:25:59,040
but it's basically my underwear and balls too.

563
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:00,080
Let's go to the money sign.

564
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:11,200
Speaking of undies.

565
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:12,720
Speaking of undies.

566
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:15,360
Oh man, that is not intentional.

567
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:17,280
But hey, me undies.

568
00:26:17,280 --> 00:26:19,200
I'll tell you what I need to do.

569
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:20,320
You know what I need to do?

570
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:24,880
I need to just go to meundies.com slash my brother

571
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:27,520
and get some of the best underwear on earth.

572
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:32,160
I talk about how this ruins my day wearing bad underwear.

573
00:26:32,160 --> 00:26:36,400
Me undies is going to scoop me up in the most delectable,

574
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:41,600
comfortable underwear I've ever owned and whisk me away.

575
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:44,400
And if I go to meundies.com slash my brother,

576
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:47,040
I'm going to get 20% off my first order.

577
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:47,680
Fuck yeah.

578
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:49,120
And then you're going to love it, Justin.

579
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:52,000
You know what the viscousness rating on these undies are?

580
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:53,280
A plus.

581
00:26:53,280 --> 00:26:53,760
Infinite?

582
00:26:55,120 --> 00:26:56,480
Well, not infinite.

583
00:26:56,480 --> 00:26:58,400
That would just be like wearing a cloud.

584
00:26:58,400 --> 00:26:59,360
Wearing mood slime.

585
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:01,920
No, it's going to feel so great.

586
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:04,000
It's a delectable weave.

587
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:05,040
You're going to love how these undies-

588
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:06,320
A delectable weave?

589
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:10,720
You're going to love how these undies feel on your breezeway.

590
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:11,920
I guarantee it.

591
00:27:11,920 --> 00:27:13,120
And it's not just undies.

592
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:14,720
They've got like t-shirts and stuff too.

593
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:19,600
They've got pretty much your under clothes, it's covered.

594
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:21,280
Men, women, everyone.

595
00:27:21,280 --> 00:27:25,360
You can take a t-shirt and you can flip it upside down

596
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:26,560
and put your legs through the arm holes

597
00:27:26,560 --> 00:27:27,680
and use that as underwear.

598
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:30,240
And it's still going to feel better than the bullshit joke ass

599
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:32,000
underwear that you're wearing right now.

600
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:35,440
I'm looking at the banner across the top of the me undies website

601
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:39,360
and it threw me for a second because it says men, women, more.

602
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:42,560
And then I thought it said refer, but it said refer.

603
00:27:42,560 --> 00:27:44,960
And that was a much different thing you can buy.

604
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:45,600
We got you.

605
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:46,160
What do you need?

606
00:27:46,160 --> 00:27:47,040
Shirts?

607
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:47,680
Underwears?

608
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:52,160
Did you need a little bit-

609
00:27:53,040 --> 00:27:55,360
Did you want a tank top or a dank top?

610
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:03,280
Did you want underwear or did you want pot?

611
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:07,360
They got seat clothes too,

612
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:10,800
so if you're looking for something to drunkenly pass out in, covered.

613
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:14,560
Or in a fog of that seat, see Sticky Mary Jane.

614
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:19,040
Your pass out game is going to increase tenfold.

615
00:28:19,040 --> 00:28:20,240
I guarantee it.

616
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:23,120
I'm on their website buying underwear right now

617
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:27,520
and I also have to say that they have some really attractive models.

618
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:30,080
Men, women, whatever kind of butts you want to look at,

619
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:31,600
they have got them here for you.

620
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:33,360
Butts and butts and butts and butts.

621
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:34,640
Butts for miles.

622
00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:36,160
Bait for days.

623
00:28:36,160 --> 00:28:39,040
They literally made all the models line up

624
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:44,640
and form a human wall of butts for three and a half miles.

625
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:47,680
Butts for miles.

626
00:28:47,680 --> 00:28:48,240
That's my-

627
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:50,720
Okay, so anyway, that's me undies slashing my brother.

628
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:51,920
Go there, get 20% off,

629
00:28:51,920 --> 00:28:55,360
get freaking comfortable for once in your life.

630
00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:55,680
Please.

631
00:28:56,560 --> 00:28:58,160
How can you buy more undies?

632
00:28:58,160 --> 00:29:00,000
Well, I'm glad you asked.

633
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:04,240
If you knew 72 hours from now that you'd have $35,000,

634
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:05,120
what would you do with it?

635
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:07,120
I would quit this stupid fucking podcast.

636
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:08,160
Hands down.

637
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:09,600
Hands down.

638
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:12,880
Maybe more normal people,

639
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:15,280
maybe they could pay off credit cards

640
00:29:15,280 --> 00:29:17,760
or start a business or a home improvement project.

641
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:25,440
Why would you want a project about home improvement?

642
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:28,080
Oh man, I fucking threaded the needle.

643
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:32,720
I don't get a lot of the MVP jokes of the show.

644
00:29:33,920 --> 00:29:35,680
So it feels really good when I know that

645
00:29:35,680 --> 00:29:37,040
I just really fucking nailed it.

646
00:29:37,040 --> 00:29:38,640
And I had the one that like,

647
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:40,880
we're gonna do the YouTube breakout video for.

648
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:42,160
I fucking love it.

649
00:29:42,160 --> 00:29:42,960
It never happened.

650
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:45,440
So I know it just happened and it feels great.

651
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:47,200
Well, if you're looking to start on a big project,

652
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:50,000
I think Prosper is gonna be your answer.

653
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:50,240
Yeah.

654
00:29:51,040 --> 00:29:52,480
Tell me about Prosper, Travis.

655
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:53,440
I mean, it's a little hard.

656
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:55,920
It's a financial thing.

657
00:29:55,920 --> 00:29:58,640
So it's a little hard to explain on a comedy podcast.

658
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:01,840
But basically the concept is it's like a peer to peer lending.

659
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:05,520
So say, you know, I'm moving cross country and I say,

660
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:07,920
I think that this is gonna end up being, yes.

661
00:30:07,920 --> 00:30:10,240
I think this is gonna end up costing me $20,000.

662
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:11,760
I don't have $20,000.

663
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:12,720
You sure don't.

664
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:13,920
But I go to a bank and I say,

665
00:30:13,920 --> 00:30:15,360
hey, I need $20,000 to move.

666
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:16,720
And they're like, yeah, that's not really

667
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:18,720
the kind of loan we give out, right?

668
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:21,040
In the olden days, I'd be done.

669
00:30:21,040 --> 00:30:21,600
That would be it.

670
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:23,120
And like, well, I guess I'll wait two years

671
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:24,880
and save the money, right?

672
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:28,160
But with Prosper, I just go on Prosper

673
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:30,240
and I make a post, you know,

674
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:32,800
I make a listing that say, I'm looking for this.

675
00:30:32,800 --> 00:30:35,920
So then everybody, the lenders on Prosper

676
00:30:35,920 --> 00:30:37,920
are all other Prosper users.

677
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:39,760
So they go, okay, great.

678
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:41,360
This seems like a good investment.

679
00:30:42,160 --> 00:30:43,520
He's got a good rating.

680
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:44,880
He's paid back his other stuff.

681
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:45,920
I'm gonna do this.

682
00:30:45,920 --> 00:30:48,880
And then you give that person a loan

683
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:49,920
and they pay you back.

684
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:52,960
So basically it cuts out the middleman of the banks

685
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:55,600
and makes it so that you are loaning your money

686
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:57,120
and getting that money paid back.

687
00:30:57,120 --> 00:30:59,120
I like the sound of this.

688
00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:01,600
Yeah, I mean, it's a genius idea.

689
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:06,240
Basically, you'll never have to set foot in a bank.

690
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:08,960
There's no outrageous fees, no raising interest rates.

691
00:31:09,680 --> 00:31:10,800

00:31:10,800 --> 00:31:13,280

Go check it out.

706
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:47,440
I hope it, I hope.

707
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:49,520
Does it still legally apply?

708
00:31:49,520 --> 00:31:51,440
It still legally applies.

709
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:51,760
Okay.

710
00:31:52,800 --> 00:31:53,520
What is this voice?

711
00:31:53,520 --> 00:31:55,200
Sorry, I missed the intro to this voice.

712
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:57,680
It's several voices combined.

713
00:31:57,680 --> 00:32:03,760
It's female Woody Allen and also jerky voice apparently.

714
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:07,200
I have a favor to ask everybody.

715
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:09,600
Well, not a favor because a favor makes,

716
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:12,640
it sounds like I'm asking you to do something unpleasant.

717
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:15,440
What I'm asking you to do will be most pleasurable.

718
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:16,400
I guarantee it.

719
00:32:17,040 --> 00:32:18,720
I want you to check out-

720
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:20,640
Griffin guarantees your pleasure.

721
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:23,840
I want you to check out the Lovecraft Brewing Company.

722
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:28,400
They are, they got a Kickstarter campaign going right now

723
00:32:28,400 --> 00:32:33,920
to open up a farmhouse style craft brewery up Washington.

724
00:32:35,040 --> 00:32:40,800
And they are crafting beers that are all Lovecraftian in nature

725
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:46,400
like the Hypnos IPA, the Elder God Beer de Gard,

726
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:51,840
a lot of Bruce Hulu barley wine, a lot of really, really great stuff.

727
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:53,280
So yeah, they are raising money.

728
00:32:53,280 --> 00:32:57,280
They have asked for our help to signal boost their campaign.

729
00:32:57,280 --> 00:33:00,800
And they have a lot of really great rewards for backers.

730
00:33:00,800 --> 00:33:03,600
They've got a couple of limited edition prints, coasters,

731
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:06,960
t-shirts, glassware, and lots of different levels.

732
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:10,160
And if you live in Washington, you should help out with this anyway

733
00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:13,520
because I mean, I'm sure it's going to be delicious,

734
00:33:13,520 --> 00:33:16,480
I mean, I'm sure it's going to be delicious, but also-

735
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:19,920
It would also be nice for Washington to finally get like a craft brewing company.

736
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:23,760
You know, something that scene, it's ready to start.

737
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:27,440
It's time to start a craft brewing company in Washington finally.

738
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:28,480
Yeah, for once.

739
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:30,240
So anyway, yeah, Lovecraft Brewing.

740
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:32,080
Check it out on Kickstarter, Facebook, or Google.

741
00:33:33,040 --> 00:33:33,840
Great.

742
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:37,440
Kevin Locky, I got a message for you from Nicholas Bale.

743
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:40,800
He says, hey Kevin, you board game playing goof.

744
00:33:40,800 --> 00:33:42,560
I couldn't think of what to get you for your birthday.

745
00:33:42,560 --> 00:33:44,240
So here's a message from me to you.

746
00:33:44,800 --> 00:33:45,840
Happy birthday.

747
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:46,640
All right.

748
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:50,720
Enjoy this message from the three wisest brothers I know

749
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:54,720
sent one month before your special day, so it's probably late.

750
00:33:55,280 --> 00:33:57,520
You're a cool guy who's fun to game with

751
00:33:57,520 --> 00:33:59,680
and I hope this year is your best yet.

752
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:03,120
Listen, Nicholas, don't fucking throw shade on us.

753
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:04,880
So it's probably late.

754
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:06,320
Maybe it's not late.

755
00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:09,040
I thought that was Nicholas throwing shit on himself and saying-

756
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:10,400
I got a podcast for you.

757
00:34:10,400 --> 00:34:13,440
I didn't get in quick enough because I know I have to request them

758
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:14,720
like eight months in advance.

759
00:34:14,720 --> 00:34:15,120
Yeah.

760
00:34:15,120 --> 00:34:16,800
I got a podcast for you on this network.

761
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:19,840
If you want to throw shade, it's called Throwing Shade.

762
00:34:19,840 --> 00:34:24,800
And I think your brand of comedy will be more welcome there, Mr.

763
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:25,920
It's also a great show.

764
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:27,120
It's also a really good show.

765
00:34:27,120 --> 00:34:28,960
It's like fun to listen to, but still also-

766
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:30,560
You turd.

767
00:34:31,680 --> 00:34:32,480
Thanks for your money.

768
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:36,000
Thanks for the money and happy birthday, Kevin.

769
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:37,600
Thanks for your turd money.

770
00:34:37,600 --> 00:34:39,760
Thanks for the turd money, Nicholas.

771
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:42,560
It smells like turds, but it spins like gold.

772
00:34:44,880 --> 00:34:46,320
Hi, my name is Ruchikesh Hereway

773
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:48,640
and I have a podcast called Song Exploder.

774
00:34:48,640 --> 00:34:51,280
In each episode, a musician takes apart one of their songs

775
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:54,000
and piece by piece tells you the story of how it was made.

776
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,720
You get an inside look into the creative and technical process

777
00:34:56,720 --> 00:34:58,960
and a unique view of a song by hearing just the drums

778
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:05,360
or just the guitars or say just a Wurlitzer piano.

779
00:35:05,360 --> 00:35:07,360
If you're a fan of music, if you make music,

780
00:35:07,360 --> 00:35:09,040
or if you just like to learn how things are made,

781
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:11,200
come check it out on Maximumfun.org.

782
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:11,700
Thanks.

783
00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:15,600
I got a Yahoo here.

784
00:35:15,600 --> 00:35:16,320
All right.

785
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:21,280
And it was sent in by a level 300 Emerald member shaman,

786
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:22,320
Drew Davenport.

787
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:23,120
Yeah, Drew.

788
00:35:23,120 --> 00:35:23,920
Thank you, Yadru.

789
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:28,400
It's by Yahoo Answers user, Hazza, who asks,

790
00:35:29,360 --> 00:35:32,880
what do you think Brutus would reply to see the song

791
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:38,320
Et Tu Brute?

792
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:42,000
I'm doing a project based off the fault in our Stars movie

793
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:42,880
poster.

794
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:45,680
The top cloud says Et Tu Brute.

795
00:35:45,680 --> 00:35:48,880
The bottom cloud would have to be something after that.

796
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:52,480
I was going to use Et Tu Caesar, but I don't think that

797
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:53,600
makes much sense.

798
00:35:53,600 --> 00:35:54,100
Nope.

799
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:58,080
What would be a good relatively short quote to put?

800
00:35:58,080 --> 00:35:59,520
Doesn't have to be a real quote.

801
00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:02,560
Also, if you have better quote instead of the Et Tu Brute,

802
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:04,320
something having to do with Brutus and Cassius,

803
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:05,120
that would also work.

804
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:08,480
So we're helping this person do homework, it sounds like.

805
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:12,800
And it sounds like it's an English teacher who's trying

806
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:14,000
to be fun, I guess.

807
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:17,360
I'm thinking like Et Tu Brute?

808
00:36:17,360 --> 00:36:19,200
Yeah, Et Tu Brute.

809
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:19,700
Yeah.

810
00:36:20,080 --> 00:36:20,580
Maybe?

811
00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:23,120
That would be like Et Three Brute.

812
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:26,240
No, I don't think that's how Latin works.

813
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:28,800
I love the play.

814
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:31,440
I think it's the only Shakespeare play I've ever been

815
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:32,480
and I played Casca.

816
00:36:33,360 --> 00:36:34,640
You were excellent, by the way.

817
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:34,960
Thank you.

818
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:39,040
I don't want to brag, but I was fucking awesome.

819
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:42,400
And I got really good reviews from the New York Post.

820
00:36:44,720 --> 00:36:48,000
But I do think that it could be improved if when Caesar's like,

821
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,320
you did this, this is how you do me.

822
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:55,040
If Brutus was like, yeah, you basic bitch.

823
00:36:58,000 --> 00:36:59,520
You've just been Brutus.

824
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:00,720
Travis, you've done a lot of like-

825
00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:02,640
And starring Aaron Paul as Brutus.

826
00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:06,160
You've done a lot of like Shakespeare bullshit,

827
00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:07,840
a lot of follies in your life.

828
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:10,560
So you're probably better at Latin than I am.

829
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:12,640
How would you say in Latin?

830
00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:13,280
Yeah, that's right.

831
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:14,480
You basic bitch.

832
00:37:17,120 --> 00:37:19,760
Ath they, ite re, ou ye.

833
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:20,560
No, you didn't do it.

834
00:37:21,120 --> 00:37:22,000
Come on.

835
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:24,400
That was low, low, low hanging fruit.

836
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:26,000
I went on Google Translate.

837
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:27,840
You went on Dad Joke Translate.

838
00:37:27,840 --> 00:37:33,440
It'll change your regular jokes to dad jokes.

839
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:37,520
Do you know what I mean?

840
00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:38,000
Like that scene-

841
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:39,920
It's a real talk, but real talk.

842
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:43,200
There's so many amazing quotes from Caesar

843
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:45,600
that why would you pull the one that's basically like,

844
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:46,880
really, Brutus?

845
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:47,520
Really, dog?

846
00:37:48,080 --> 00:37:48,480
Really?

847
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:52,080
That's the line where like, yeah, this is Brutus.

848
00:37:52,080 --> 00:37:56,000
Because he put it in Latin, this is just brilliant writing.

849
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,000
He's just saying, you too, Brutus?

850
00:37:58,000 --> 00:37:58,240
Yeah.

851
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:00,320
Like, yeah, let's do it.

852
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:03,280
What if he'd be like, what if in response Brutus is like,

853
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:06,160
it's pronounced Brutus.

854
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:09,360
You dummy.

855
00:38:09,360 --> 00:38:09,760
Everybody's been-

856
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:10,800
This is why you get stabbed.

857
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:11,920
You don't know anyone's name.

858
00:38:12,640 --> 00:38:14,880
Everybody's been saying it the whole play.

859
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:19,200
Your last words is a fuck up.

860
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:19,520
And then you get him again.

861
00:38:19,520 --> 00:38:22,000
Why did you just start speaking Latin?

862
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:25,120
We're Roman.

863
00:38:25,120 --> 00:38:28,320
Did the knife hit the part of your brain for English?

864
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:32,000
Do you guys think in plays,

865
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:34,640
the person who plays Julius Caesar thinks like,

866
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:39,360
for like a second, every night before the stabbing scene,

867
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:44,800
thinks like, what if one of these jokesters has a real knife

868
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:48,400
and thinks about like, I might get stabbed for real though.

869
00:38:49,120 --> 00:38:51,840
But then the show must go on, so you just gotta lie there and die.

870
00:38:51,840 --> 00:38:55,440
Oh God, what a believable, stirring performance that'd be.

871
00:38:55,440 --> 00:38:57,120
If I was playing Julius Caesar,

872
00:38:57,120 --> 00:38:58,960
I'm the sort that every night before I get stabbed,

873
00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:00,640
I would think, maybe not tonight.

874
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:04,560
Then what am I going to say in the play though?

875
00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:05,280
Fight them off?

876
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:05,920
Uh-huh.

877
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:08,160
Maybe this night, maybe tonight I'll win.

878
00:39:08,160 --> 00:39:09,040
I'll make a-

879
00:39:10,160 --> 00:39:13,920
Maybe tonight they won't make a heel turn,

880
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:15,920
and it'll just be at work,

881
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:18,480
and I'll just pop out like nobody's business.

882
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:20,240
You hear, speak hands for me.

883
00:39:20,240 --> 00:39:23,840
You pull out a fucking bow staff, a couple of sighs,

884
00:39:23,840 --> 00:39:28,000
like, nope, fuck your hands.

885
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:28,800
Yes, and.

886
00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:32,800
Yeah, that would be fucking tight.

887
00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:34,560
That would be sweet, right?

888
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:38,320
Is the fault in our stars a reference to Julius Caesar?

889
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:39,280
Yeah.

890
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:40,560
I didn't know that.

891
00:39:41,120 --> 00:39:41,600
Travis.

892
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:44,720
I mean, I've been doing Shakespeare for the last five years,

893
00:39:44,720 --> 00:39:46,400
but I haven't been paying attention.

894
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:47,920
No, not that close of attention.

895
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:48,960
I've just been coasting.

896
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:50,640
You've been floating on that me undies weed.

897
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:54,720
I got a question for you guys.

898
00:39:54,720 --> 00:39:56,800
Often when I arrive at the office or a restaurant,

899
00:39:56,800 --> 00:39:59,920
I want to wash my hands because the subway is a little gnarly.

900
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:02,000
I usually lock the bathroom door when I do this,

901
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:03,280
but since I'm not using the toilet

902
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:04,320
and I'm only in there for a minute,

903
00:40:04,320 --> 00:40:06,240
locking the door feels pretty useless.

904
00:40:06,240 --> 00:40:09,360
But if I stop locking the door, what if someone walks in?

905
00:40:09,360 --> 00:40:12,160
Should I keep locking the door only when hand washing

906
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:14,960
or risk a weird moment to avoid the hassle?

907
00:40:14,960 --> 00:40:17,680
Listen, we can, that was from Gmail.

908
00:40:17,680 --> 00:40:20,720
We can burn through this one in 20 seconds.

909
00:40:20,720 --> 00:40:22,560
You shouldn't lock the door

910
00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:24,960
when you go to the bathroom to wash your hands,

911
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:27,680
because why wouldn't you want to brag about the fact

912
00:40:27,680 --> 00:40:29,120
that you're washing your hands?

913
00:40:29,120 --> 00:40:31,680
I can't envision a scenario in which someone walks in

914
00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:32,880
and you've got soapy hands and it's like,

915
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:35,440
uh, I don't know, don't know.

916
00:40:36,640 --> 00:40:38,320
God, you tell no one.

917
00:40:39,360 --> 00:40:41,120
You take this to your grave, Steven.

918
00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:44,000
Situation for me would be a little more like,

919
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:46,080
come on in, come check this clean boy.

920
00:40:46,080 --> 00:40:48,720
I'm doing the nails too.

921
00:40:48,720 --> 00:40:50,000
This isn't just a water rinse.

922
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:51,280
I did the soap and everything.

923
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:52,720
No one's gonna walk in and be like,

924
00:40:52,720 --> 00:40:55,040
is that soap on your hands or come?

925
00:40:58,320 --> 00:41:00,880
On the other hand, I also don't know what the scenario is

926
00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:03,520
where someone walks up, they try the knob, it's locked,

927
00:41:03,520 --> 00:41:04,480
and then you walk out and they go,

928
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:06,320
you were just washing your hands, weren't you?

929
00:41:06,320 --> 00:41:07,840
Well, what if it's a freak?

930
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:10,640
Okay, what if it is a single serving bathroom, right?

931
00:41:10,640 --> 00:41:13,520
No stalls, no stalls, no area stall to be seen.

932
00:41:13,520 --> 00:41:15,760
And somebody just like tests the door.

933
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:16,800
It's open.

934
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:18,720
They already have their pants around their ankles.

935
00:41:18,720 --> 00:41:23,040
They turn around, do a flip 180, pop down on that toilet,

936
00:41:23,040 --> 00:41:26,400
start just tearing the lever off,

937
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:28,960
and then they realize that you are in there.

938
00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:31,200
I think that the concern is more like,

939
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:33,120
I'm in this physical space where dumps happen.

940
00:41:33,680 --> 00:41:36,480
To be honest, I don't know why you wouldn't just lock the door.

941
00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:39,120
Because you want people to see you washing your hands.

942
00:41:39,120 --> 00:41:39,760
I just-

943
00:41:39,760 --> 00:41:41,200
Maybe announce as you're walking in,

944
00:41:41,200 --> 00:41:43,440
I'm just washing my hands, so I'm not gonna lock the door,

945
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:45,520
but please don't come in and start pooping while I'm in here.

946
00:41:45,520 --> 00:41:46,240
Yeah.

947
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:48,880
See you all in like, tops 45 seconds.

948
00:41:48,880 --> 00:41:52,320
I don't understand people who don't lock the door reflexively.

949
00:41:52,320 --> 00:41:57,040
Just like, thank God, finally, a few moments of peace.

950
00:41:57,840 --> 00:42:00,560
Just a few moments to myself away from the rest of them.

951
00:42:00,560 --> 00:42:02,080
A few moments of peace.

952
00:42:03,840 --> 00:42:04,640
I'm with you, Justin.

953
00:42:04,640 --> 00:42:05,280
Just lock the door.

954
00:42:06,560 --> 00:42:07,120
I guess.

955
00:42:07,120 --> 00:42:09,440
No one will judge you for locking the door,

956
00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:11,760
but it will be weird if someone walks in and you're in there.

957
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:13,120
Even if you're just washing your hands,

958
00:42:13,120 --> 00:42:16,880
especially if it's a small, like there's just a sink and a toilet in the bathroom,

959
00:42:16,880 --> 00:42:17,680
and they walk in and it's like,

960
00:42:17,680 --> 00:42:19,040
oh, sorry, I didn't know anyway.

961
00:42:19,040 --> 00:42:20,880
Because they'll see you and think,

962
00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:22,880
if I had walked in 10 seconds earlier, they might still be peeing.

963
00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:24,400
I would have seen Dong, yes.

964
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:24,720
Yeah.

965
00:42:24,720 --> 00:42:25,680
Absolutely.

966
00:42:25,680 --> 00:42:27,040
What are you doing, you sicko?

967
00:42:27,040 --> 00:42:30,000
Why do you want me to see you do that thing?

968
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:32,960
Unless they see you walk in and they can time out,

969
00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:34,320
like, oh, it's only like 35 seconds.

970
00:42:34,320 --> 00:42:35,200
Probably just washing his hands.

971
00:42:35,200 --> 00:42:38,400
Because everyone times it out no matter what you say.

972
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:41,280
And also, why did you wash your hands if you didn't use the bathroom?

973
00:42:41,280 --> 00:42:43,520
Did you kill somebody?

974
00:42:43,520 --> 00:42:43,920
Killer?

975
00:42:45,760 --> 00:42:49,680
Hey, Steve, have you noticed that Jerry washes his hands every morning when he comes in?

976
00:42:49,680 --> 00:42:50,640
What's his deal?

977
00:42:51,520 --> 00:42:52,800
I don't know, but he's not pooping.

978
00:42:52,800 --> 00:42:53,520
I timed it out.

979
00:42:55,360 --> 00:42:56,240
Look at my logs.

980
00:42:56,960 --> 00:42:57,520
Stop it.

981
00:42:59,520 --> 00:43:00,320
Do another question.

982
00:43:01,600 --> 00:43:01,840
Yeah.

983
00:43:02,400 --> 00:43:04,000
Over the past few weeks in university,

984
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:06,800
I've noticed several people, both men and women,

985
00:43:06,800 --> 00:43:11,520
sitting their disgusting bare feet on the back of chairs in front of them during lectures.

986
00:43:12,480 --> 00:43:15,200
How do I nicely and subtly let these people know

987
00:43:15,200 --> 00:43:17,040
they are human monsters who need to stop?

988
00:43:17,840 --> 00:43:19,200
That's from the barefoot belligerent.

989
00:43:20,080 --> 00:43:21,600
You gotta tell on them to the teacher.

990
00:43:22,720 --> 00:43:24,080
Excuse me, teach.

991
00:43:24,080 --> 00:43:24,960
Hey, teach.

992
00:43:24,960 --> 00:43:25,120
I don't want-

993
00:43:25,120 --> 00:43:25,920
Yo, teach.

994
00:43:25,920 --> 00:43:26,880
Beat these feets.

995
00:43:26,880 --> 00:43:30,000
I'm trying to make friends over here and have a great college experience,

996
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:32,640
but Brenda won't get her fucking dirty feet off the table.

997
00:43:32,640 --> 00:43:34,240
This little piggy went to disgusting.

998
00:43:34,240 --> 00:43:34,720
Mm-hmm.

999
00:43:34,720 --> 00:43:37,200
I'm trying to enrich myself with education.

1000
00:43:38,480 --> 00:43:40,160
I feel like this is a much bigger problem.

1001
00:43:40,160 --> 00:43:41,600
Whenever I go to a movie theater,

1002
00:43:41,600 --> 00:43:44,960
I feel like two out of three people are putting their feet up.

1003
00:43:44,960 --> 00:43:46,800
Maybe not bare feet, maybe still in shoes,

1004
00:43:46,800 --> 00:43:48,560
but up on the back of the seats.

1005
00:43:49,200 --> 00:43:51,520
And it's like, were you born in a barn?

1006
00:43:51,520 --> 00:43:53,200
Like who, why would you do that?

1007
00:43:53,200 --> 00:43:54,560
It's so upsetting to me.

1008
00:43:55,200 --> 00:43:56,960
Why would you think like, this is a cool thing.

1009
00:43:56,960 --> 00:43:58,480
I know I'm in public and this is like-

1010
00:43:58,480 --> 00:43:59,040
Because it feels-

1011
00:43:59,040 --> 00:44:00,320
A place where a bunch of other people hang out.

1012
00:44:00,320 --> 00:44:01,760
It feels so good.

1013
00:44:02,400 --> 00:44:04,080
It also feels good not to wear pants.

1014
00:44:04,080 --> 00:44:06,160
I'm not going to do that listening to a lecture.

1015
00:44:06,160 --> 00:44:09,600
Is the problem with this that we, the decent people of the world,

1016
00:44:09,600 --> 00:44:10,960
are just not speaking up enough?

1017
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:14,880
Does this person owe it to the rest of us to just stand up and say,

1018
00:44:14,880 --> 00:44:18,080
put your shoes on and put your feet down?

1019
00:44:18,080 --> 00:44:19,920
Oh, and maybe the person will be like, thank you.

1020
00:44:19,920 --> 00:44:20,960
I was waiting to see.

1021
00:44:20,960 --> 00:44:22,160
Nobody said anything.

1022
00:44:22,160 --> 00:44:23,680
I never had boundaries before.

1023
00:44:23,680 --> 00:44:26,560
My parents didn't, they were like helicopter parents,

1024
00:44:26,560 --> 00:44:29,200
but they never like trained me in how to be a decent human.

1025
00:44:29,200 --> 00:44:31,120
Thank you for giving me boundaries.

1026
00:44:31,120 --> 00:44:31,680
Now I know.

1027
00:44:31,680 --> 00:44:33,520
The person stands up and turns around.

1028
00:44:33,520 --> 00:44:34,800
It was Jason Mraz.

1029
00:44:34,800 --> 00:44:36,160
He says, you set me free.

1030
00:44:37,120 --> 00:44:40,080
He turns ethereal and floats into the air and he evaporates.

1031
00:44:42,320 --> 00:44:45,120
You ever see people with their bare feet up like on dashboards

1032
00:44:45,120 --> 00:44:46,320
in like the passenger seat?

1033
00:44:46,320 --> 00:44:47,920
I got to hoot the passenger seat,

1034
00:44:47,920 --> 00:44:50,400
but like feet up on the dashboards on long drives.

1035
00:44:50,400 --> 00:44:51,440
That pisses me out too.

1036
00:44:51,440 --> 00:44:52,160
No, I mean, that was fine.

1037
00:44:52,160 --> 00:44:54,720
Not as much, not as much, but it's still troubling.

1038
00:44:54,720 --> 00:44:58,080
Do you ever Google pictures of the bare feet of the guy from Dashboard Confessional?

1039
00:44:58,640 --> 00:44:59,140
Yeah.

1040
00:44:59,760 --> 00:45:00,640
Chris Carrabba's.

1041
00:45:00,640 --> 00:45:03,920
Do you ever Google pictures of the bare naked ladies?

1042
00:45:03,920 --> 00:45:06,320
I'm going to just real quick and treat myself.

1043
00:45:08,240 --> 00:45:13,760
Hey, on that note, Google, if I could ask everybody Googling a favor,

1044
00:45:14,880 --> 00:45:21,280
it would be great if anytime I do a Google search on an actress,

1045
00:45:22,480 --> 00:45:25,200
Or any human woman.

1046
00:45:25,200 --> 00:45:33,200
Any human woman, the very, very, very first auto complete response was not feet.

1047
00:45:33,200 --> 00:45:35,600
That would be like amazing.

1048
00:45:35,600 --> 00:45:39,760
If I could just like investigate the career of Miss Juliana Margulies,

1049
00:45:39,760 --> 00:45:44,960
like on my own accord and find out like when the year she was active on ER,

1050
00:45:44,960 --> 00:45:50,320
that sort of thing, without like the very first response being pictures of her feet,

1051
00:45:50,320 --> 00:45:52,080
that would be like the best for me.

1052
00:45:52,080 --> 00:45:55,280
I gotta tell you, Justin, it's both sides of the aisle too,

1053
00:45:55,280 --> 00:46:03,040
because if you type CH into Google, it autofills Chris Carrabba's feet from Dashboard Confessional.

1054
00:46:03,920 --> 00:46:07,200
Chris Carrabba's, and then in parentheses, from Dashboard Confessional,

1055
00:46:07,200 --> 00:46:10,000
and his luscious feet is what it autofills.

1056
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:10,880
Just by CH.

1057
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:15,600
That's, man, people need to get their Google habits fixed,

1058
00:46:15,600 --> 00:46:16,480
because this is breaking my heart.

1059
00:46:16,480 --> 00:46:18,000
Or start using Ask Jeeves.

1060
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:22,880
Yeah.

1061
00:46:22,880 --> 00:46:25,760
What if all the feet searches have been Ask Jeeves the whole time?

1062
00:46:25,760 --> 00:46:27,920
What a delicious tendency.

1063
00:46:31,520 --> 00:46:33,600
The Achilles tendons are my weakness.

1064
00:46:37,680 --> 00:46:39,680
Thank you guys so much for listening.

1065
00:46:39,680 --> 00:46:42,160
Guys and gals for listening too.

1066
00:46:42,160 --> 00:46:44,960
I say guys, but I don't really mean that gendered, but I guess it has gendered roots.

1067
00:46:44,960 --> 00:46:48,400
That probably means that English doesn't have the plural pronoun.

1068
00:46:48,400 --> 00:46:49,040
It has y'all.

1069
00:46:49,040 --> 00:46:54,720
Yeah, people make fun of y'all, but that's actually just a correction in English anyway.

1070
00:46:55,600 --> 00:46:58,400
Thank you for listening to our program, my brother, my brother, and me.

1071
00:46:59,120 --> 00:47:05,760
You can tweet about our show using the NBNBAM hashtag or at NBNBAM on Twitter.

1072
00:47:05,760 --> 00:47:10,880
If you wanna get in on a huge social media awakening right now,

1073
00:47:10,880 --> 00:47:12,800
I guess that's not overstating things too much,

1074
00:47:12,800 --> 00:47:16,400
you should go to the my brother, my brother, and me appreciation group.

1075
00:47:16,400 --> 00:47:21,200
It is a public group that is, I mean, it's ballooning out of control.

1076
00:47:21,200 --> 00:47:22,240
I think I can say that.

1077
00:47:22,240 --> 00:47:29,520
It is a massive, massive group that is growing like gangbusters for no reason that I can detect.

1078
00:47:29,520 --> 00:47:30,560
No reason at all.

1079
00:47:30,560 --> 00:47:33,280
People, it looks like they're posting every five minutes.

1080
00:47:33,280 --> 00:47:34,560
Somebody's posting something on there.

1081
00:47:34,560 --> 00:47:35,440
It's fantastic.

1082
00:47:35,440 --> 00:47:37,920
There's a lot, I tell you what there is though.

1083
00:47:37,920 --> 00:47:43,040
There are a lot of people asking about what episode they can find a certain bit.

1084
00:47:43,040 --> 00:47:46,320
It would be amazing if we can harness this Facebook group to finally make the Wiki

1085
00:47:46,320 --> 00:47:49,440
that we've been needing for all these many years.

1086
00:47:49,440 --> 00:47:55,040
Or if we can harness it to making us have our own fucking Wikipedia page, which we never had.

1087
00:47:55,040 --> 00:47:56,080
Yeah, bullshit.

1088
00:47:56,080 --> 00:47:56,800
Come on.

1089
00:47:56,800 --> 00:48:00,800
Anyway, just search for my brother, my brother, and me appreciation group on Facebook

1090
00:48:00,800 --> 00:48:02,480
and you can join it and it'll make you happy.

1091
00:48:03,280 --> 00:48:06,400
You should also check out our new Tumblr's up, yes?

1092
00:48:06,400 --> 00:48:08,640
Oh yes, it is.

1093
00:48:08,640 --> 00:48:09,280
And what's the-

1094
00:48:09,280 --> 00:48:10,720
mmbam.tumblr.com.

1095
00:48:11,440 --> 00:48:16,160
It's just, you know, like a regular Tumblr, it's got lots of stuff on it.

1096
00:48:16,160 --> 00:48:20,160
I wish you two would add something to it ever instead of just making me do it all the time.

1097
00:48:20,160 --> 00:48:21,760
I put videos up on it.

1098
00:48:21,760 --> 00:48:22,080
Maybe I'll start like-

1099
00:48:22,080 --> 00:48:23,360
Travis, I'm looking at it right now.

1100
00:48:23,360 --> 00:48:24,640
You have put nothing up on it.

1101
00:48:24,640 --> 00:48:27,440
I don't understand, I guess, what Tumblr's for.

1102
00:48:27,440 --> 00:48:30,880
I just thought it was like where people put their tasteful nudes.

1103
00:48:32,800 --> 00:48:34,400
That might not be accurate.

1104
00:48:34,400 --> 00:48:35,680
I'll try to write some stuff on it.

1105
00:48:35,680 --> 00:48:38,640
I mean, I don't use it to put like your-

1106
00:48:38,640 --> 00:48:39,920
Don't use it as like a diary.

1107
00:48:39,920 --> 00:48:40,480
It's not like-

1108
00:48:40,480 --> 00:48:41,520
I'll post my musings.

1109
00:48:42,240 --> 00:48:42,800
Oh God.

1110
00:48:43,920 --> 00:48:48,080
Here's some observations on today's news from my skewed perspective.

1111
00:48:48,800 --> 00:48:49,680
It's Travis.

1112
00:48:49,680 --> 00:48:50,160
Travis.

1113
00:48:52,160 --> 00:48:55,760
These aren't going to be the most popular opinions, but goddammit, they're mine.

1114
00:48:57,760 --> 00:48:58,080
I want to-

1115
00:48:58,080 --> 00:48:58,640
Go check that out.

1116
00:48:58,640 --> 00:48:59,920
Check out our YouTube page as well.

1117
00:48:59,920 --> 00:49:00,720
I put-

1118
00:49:00,720 --> 00:49:03,120
So a lot of people really liked the Adventure Zone.

1119
00:49:03,120 --> 00:49:08,800
If you want to share it with a friend, we made a YouTube video of the whole episode.

1120
00:49:09,920 --> 00:49:11,520
It's a little bit easier to share.

1121
00:49:11,520 --> 00:49:15,440
It's a little bit more consumable for people that maybe don't normally listen to podcasts.

1122
00:49:15,440 --> 00:49:16,720
So it's on there.

1123
00:49:17,680 --> 00:49:18,400
So go check it out.

1124
00:49:19,520 --> 00:49:20,160
I want to thank-

1125
00:49:21,760 --> 00:49:22,720
I almost said Yahoo.

1126
00:49:23,760 --> 00:49:24,480
Goddammit.

1127
00:49:25,040 --> 00:49:28,160
I want to thank John Roderick in the long winters for the use of our theme song,

1128
00:49:28,160 --> 00:49:30,880
It's a Departure, off the album, putting the days to bed.

1129
00:49:30,880 --> 00:49:32,640
It's a truly fantastic album.

1130
00:49:32,640 --> 00:49:36,400
I was doing some cooking this past weekend.

1131
00:49:36,400 --> 00:49:40,800
I had it playing on vinyl, and it was like 58 degrees here in Austin.

1132
00:49:40,800 --> 00:49:44,640
I had all the windows open and just smelling that fall foliage.

1133
00:49:44,640 --> 00:49:45,200
That's a recipe.

1134
00:49:45,200 --> 00:49:46,080
That's chili making.

1135
00:49:46,080 --> 00:49:46,640
That's-

1136
00:49:46,640 --> 00:49:48,640
Oh my god, it was a dream, is what it was.

1137
00:49:48,640 --> 00:49:50,160
So get that album.

1138
00:49:50,160 --> 00:49:51,280
It's perfect for chili.

1139
00:49:52,320 --> 00:49:54,560

And they might even throw a little bit of nug of weed in the box.

1143
00:50:04,560 --> 00:50:05,760
They won't do that.

1144
00:50:05,760 --> 00:50:08,240
They might even give you a little bit of a nug of weed.

1145
00:50:08,800 --> 00:50:10,480
Check out all the other great shows on MaxFun.

1146

1151
00:50:33,360 --> 00:50:34,560

00:50:34,560 --> 00:50:35,360
Slam Bam Pow.

1153
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:36,800
Slam Bam Pow.

1154
00:50:36,800 --> 00:50:37,760
Oh no, Ross and Carrie.

1155
00:50:38,800 --> 00:50:39,440
The Goose Down?

1156
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:40,720
The Goose Down.

1157
00:50:41,760 --> 00:50:42,480
Lady and a Lady?

1158
00:50:42,480 --> 00:50:43,520
It's Judge John Hodgman.

1159
00:50:43,520 --> 00:50:44,020
Griffin.

1160
00:50:44,560 --> 00:50:45,520
Griffin, last question.

1161
00:50:47,040 --> 00:50:48,560
Thank you all for listening.

1162
00:50:48,560 --> 00:50:49,440
Thank you.

1163
00:50:49,440 --> 00:50:51,440
This final Yahoo was sent in by Elia K.

1164
00:50:51,440 --> 00:50:52,240
Thank you, Elia.

1165
00:50:52,240 --> 00:50:58,640
It's by Yahoo Answers user Allie, who asks, my dad is a goth.

1166
00:50:58,640 --> 00:50:59,360
What do I do?

1167
00:51:00,640 --> 00:51:02,000

This has been My Brother, My Brother.

1171
00:51:04,480 --> 00:51:05,440
May kiss your dad.

1172
00:51:05,440 --> 00:51:05,920
School.

1173
00:51:05,920 --> 00:51:23,920
Wear on the lips.

1174
00:51:23,920 --> 00:51:25,840

That's an action and sci-fi movie podcast you can find on Maximumfun.org or on iTunes.

1183

1185
00:51:50,400 --> 00:51:51,520
Tons of things you can use.

1186
00:51:51,520 --> 00:51:54,960
We break it down so it can forever be broken.

1187
00:51:54,960 --> 00:51:56,240
Hilarious jokes.

1188
00:51:56,240 --> 00:51:57,840
Plus, sometimes there's a dog in the studio.

1189
00:51:57,840 --> 00:51:59,120
Sometimes there's a dog here.

1190
00:51:59,120 --> 00:52:10,240
We'll see you in your earbuds.
