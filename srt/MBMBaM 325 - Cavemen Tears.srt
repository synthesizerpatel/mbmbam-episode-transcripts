1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:30,720
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:49,120
Hello, everybody, and welcome to My Brother, My Brother, Me, an advice show for the modern era.

6
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:53,200
I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy. I'm your middle-est brother, Travis McElroy.

7
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:56,400
I'm that sweet baby brother that you crave, Griffin McElroy.

8
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:59,440
How's your guys' weekends? Do you have good weekends out there?

9
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:06,320
I have been, I am taking 12 hours of birthing classes this weekend from 10 to 4 every day

10
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:19,200
for the two days, and boys, that is a gushy situation. Gushy from Quantum Leap rolls up,

11
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:22,320
and he's like, because he delivers every baby. That's the weird part.

12
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:25,680
Wow. He must be busy. He's like Santa Claus.

13
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:29,360
I'm just, I'm learning so much.

14
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:32,000
About the miracle, Griffin? About the miracle?

15
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:39,120
I mean, it is a miracle, right? The bodies do so much wonderful stuff to get it all going,

16
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:45,600
but I was, I guess, ill-prepared for the amount of stuff I didn't know, and it made me think,

17
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:54,000
I'm realizing now as I'm approaching 30 that I didn't pay very good attention in school,

18
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,080
and I get these little realizations every day, and this was the first one where it was like,

19
00:01:58,080 --> 00:02:01,440
man, I didn't even pay attention in health class, because there's stuff I did not know,

20
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:10,240
just sort of about how, like, where I originated from and grew and grew and blasted out of.

21
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:15,840
There was one video birth, and I think there's another one coming today.

22
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:18,880
They don't warn you. They just start it.

23
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:24,480
They just, they hit play. It's like a jump scare. It's like a Five Nights at Freddy's situation.

24
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:28,720
Do they at least put, like, a fun soundtrack, like Yackety Sax or something to it? Something

25
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:33,440
where it's like, hey, we know how, you know, intense this can be. We're gonna soften it just

26
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:41,520
a little bit. They play his much less popular Yuckety Sax. Yucky. Yuckety sucks. You know what?

27
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:47,680
I think rather than Yackety Sax, I think, like, Careless Whisper would be better. I think I'd

28
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:54,080
rather, like, have just some smooth, like, baritone sax playing along with it to make it seem like,

29
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:57,120
yeah, this is a smooth, non-intense, non-terrifying moment.

30
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:00,160
Did you make it born to be wild and then perhaps

31
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:04,880
some sunglasses over the baby as they come out?

32
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:10,560
And the baby comes out giving the okay sign saying, it's cool, dad. Don't even worry.

33
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:13,840
That would be tricky because it would require you to find the face

34
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:17,120
on whatever it is that comes out of there first.

35
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:18,960
Before they mold it into a baby.

36
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:25,760
What they don't tell you is you don't, you can't love what comes out initially until about 15

37
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:31,920
minutes before you can love it. People say the moment that baby was born, my entire life changed.

38
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:37,040
And that's true because you immediately feel like you're in a life or death situation,

39
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:42,000
face hugger coming at you, and you're looking around the room for, like, stray torches

40
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:46,400
or something like that, pepper spray, something to defend yourself from this creature.

41
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:50,400
There was this awesome couple that was sitting next to us in the class yesterday

42
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:54,240
who the instructor was talking about how they go, like, birth to, like,

43
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:58,240
straight to skin to skin, like, they get it on mama's chest, like, immediately.

44
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:02,800
And there was one woman who was like, I don't want that.

45
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:08,400
Wipe that thing down. I do not want all of that goo on me. No, thanks.

46
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:10,640
Wipe it down. Thank you.

47
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:14,000
The video we watched, real quick, this is a true thing.

48
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,760
Like, what we focused on a lot yesterday was, like, different positions you can get into,

49
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:22,320
like, relieve pain, but there were also different birthing positions.

50
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:26,400
This I did not know. I thought we had figured out sort of the best way to do this,

51
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:30,000
and it was, like, on the back, legs up, blast off.

52
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:37,920
No, because the video we watched, the birth was an all fours situation,

53
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:46,240
and it must have been effective because that baby just like, just like, just like blasted out of

54
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:53,920
there like it was a t-shirt cannon. It was the craziest shit I've ever, ever, ever seen.

55
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:58,160
I'm not squeamish, and I'm not, like, childish about birth. I do think it's beautiful.

56
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:01,040
This was a new sort of thing for me because it was just like,

57
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:06,640
clip-a-plio. Griffin, you can read about all the different birthing positions in the Mamasutra.

58
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,120
I can't with that. I fucking can't. It's 9 a.m.

59
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:14,560
Because it's like commas, but it's like the mama because it's like a mother.

60
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:17,600
I don't think I can't. No, you don't think we can't because it's actually a perversion of,

61
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:22,880
of, like, a nice thing. They, I actually... I mean, Kama Sutra can be a nice thing.

62
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:25,760
Yeah, it can be very nice if done properly.

63
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:34,160
Yeah, we actually are supposed to give it, like, give that baby to earth just, like,

64
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:40,880
squatting. I say wait. People capable of having babies biologically are supposed to just squat

65
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:45,120
and let that baby just, like, pop right out. They didn't invent laying on your back until, like,

66
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:51,600
the 1300s or something like that. I guess moms, I guess moms just, just got lazy.

67
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:53,040
Moms know what I'm saying. No, from what I understand,

68
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:57,040
it's actually, like, they did the laying on the back to make it easier for doctors to get in there

69
00:05:57,040 --> 00:06:00,880
so they didn't have to, like, squat. The doctor was like, I'd rather just sit on a stool. Could

70
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:04,320
you lay down, please? Yeah, what's the doctor do if mama's squatting? Does the doctor just

71
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:09,200
lay down on the floor? No, this is silly. No, he's got a giant, like, giant catcher's mitt.

72
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:16,240
Or, like, a net situation. We covered this at Max Funcon in Sydney's birthing class,

73
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:20,720
and Griffin, I'm assuming you just didn't really key in there. You're kind of assuming that

74
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:27,600
other people would halo for you, huh? I took a nap. I missed that class on Forch. Fair enough.

75
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:33,360
Let's get into the shit, huh? I mean, I'm already definitely in the shit, and literally,

76
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:36,800
as soon as we wrap this, I'm gonna hop in the shower and then go back for six more hours of

77
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:46,160
pu-pu-plow. Have they covered the fact that, um, most, most, um, poop? Oh, yeah. Okay, good,

78
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:52,480
good, good, good. But I'm not gonna make a big deal out of it. Well, actually, Justin, like,

79
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:56,960
all women poop, but just some of them do it during childbirth. Okay, here's our first question.

80
00:06:56,960 --> 00:07:01,520
This is, this is... Actually, sorry, there was a guy, there was a guy who asked about that. He's

81
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:06,080
like, at what point do I need to be afraid of getting shat on, he said, and his choice is,

82
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:10,240
well, I found it very distasteful, and his wife was very embarrassed, and the woman leaving the

83
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:16,240
house is like, 99.9 women, percent of women, like, do it, and I saw in his face a brief

84
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:21,520
moment of relief, like, all right, baby, something to, something to aspire to. Be that one in a

85
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:28,160
thousand. When you introduce yourself to someone and they call you the wrong name or decide that

86
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:33,920
they get to shorten it, like shorten Jeffrey to Jeff, exactly how many times can you correct them

87
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:40,480
without being a big old jerk? Like, at what point does Mel or Melody just become my name?

88
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:48,480
Wait. We should make it clear, her name is Melanie. Oh, okay, I was gonna say, well, Melody,

89
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:53,920
if your name's Melody, that, the die is cast. My name is Jeff, my name is Jeff. Hi, Melody.

90
00:07:53,920 --> 00:08:00,560
No, no, it's wrong. That's from just call me whatever. I would like to give a pretty

91
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:05,680
laissez-faire attitude towards it, if that's your name. I would like to pose, like, a very

92
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:13,200
non-McRoy answer. Okay. The first time it happens, look them square in the eye, and not in a jerky

93
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:21,040
way, but just in a very clear, like, just say, no, actually, it's Melanie. Period. The end.

94
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:26,080
That's such a hard one, especially over the phone, where the phone, there's like six letters,

95
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:31,680
the phone, whoever invented it, I guess Alexander Graham Bell, they were like, his assistant was

96
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:39,280
like, hey, Alex, do we need this thing to, like, recognize n's and m's and d's and t's?

97
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:46,880
And Alex was like, no, no, no, people will figure it out. Anyways, it's 420, I gotta go. Anyway,

98
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:54,480
I gotta blaze it. That was the first recording. 420, time to blaze. At the tone, it's time to

99
00:08:54,480 --> 00:09:03,840
blaze it. I'm sorry, I just, there's just not a world in which I would ever correct someone for

100
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:10,000
this. There's just not a, cause like, think about the payoff for this, right? You let the person

101
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:14,080
call whatever you want, cause in the end, it doesn't really matter that much, like, you know

102
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:18,800
what they're doing, like, you know who they want, you know they wanna get hold of you, so let them

103
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:24,320
do whatever they're gonna do. Names are for other people to get a hold of you, so like, if they

104
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:28,560
use the wrong name, like, whatever, it doesn't matter. As long as it doesn't create confusion,

105
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:32,720
fine. And then they'll do it for long enough that eventually, they're gonna do it in front of

106
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:40,000
someone that knows you better than they do, and it will be the fucking greatest payoff. Like,

107
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:45,840
really? I feel so different, Jamie. No, that's good shit, Travis. No, no, no, you're fucking,

108
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:50,560
like, you'll turn around and they'll look at you and it'll be like the fucking end of

109
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:55,440
the usual suspects. This whole time? This whole time? But I've had that happen to me.

110
00:09:56,400 --> 00:10:01,040
The person found out they were using the wrong name, and the look they gave me was like I'd been

111
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:07,520
grifting them the whole time to set them up for this moment. Yeah, no shit. It's called, like,

112
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:13,760
a kindness grift, because you are such, like, a good and generous person that cared so much about

113
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:17,200
upsetting them that you let them call you whatever you want, cause it doesn't really matter that much

114
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:21,360
anyway, and then they're going to feel bad about it forever. You know, like, you show up at work the

115
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:26,640
next day, oh, what's this on my desk? Is this a fresh baked pie with the crisscross thing on the

116
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:32,320
top? Delicious. I'm so glad I let you call me the wrong thing for so long. But the other side of

117
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:37,040
that is like, hey, has anybody seen Jerry? Oh, he quit. What? Yeah, he felt so bad for calling you

118
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:43,200
Trevor for the last six months. He just couldn't show his face anymore. He moved to another

119
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:49,040
country. He's a monk now. It's crazy. But what if the inverse happens and they let it go until you

120
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:55,840
quit, and then, like, as you're leaving the person finds out, like, your name was what the whole time?

121
00:10:55,840 --> 00:11:01,920
Or they don't even make a big deal out of it. They go up to you and they're like, see you later. Have

122
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:07,440
happy trails, Nathan. And it's like, wait, this whole time you actually knew?

123
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:11,520
So many different griffs you can pull on the name thing. Justin, I would argue that you have,

124
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:17,120
it sounds like you have a fairly laissez-faire attitude towards name truncation and wrongness,

125
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:24,240
because your name is impossible to either get wrong or shorten. Except for, except for Dustin.

126
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:29,680
But guess what? Nobody's named Dustin. That's a prank. That's actually incorrect, because I get

127
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:39,040
Jason free. I had a theater professor that called me Jason exclusively for basically all four years

128
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:45,760
of college. Not exclusively, but a considerable amount. It doesn't bother me. My great-grandmother

129
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:53,120
called me Jason some. It's just like, I don't care. I don't care. That name is missing so many sort of

130
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:59,840
word experiences that Justin has in it. It's missing, it's missing so many fun notes.

131
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:09,200
The key to happiness from what I have gathered, a big part of it is being able to let go of ego.

132
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:15,280
And like to me, being worried about what people are calling you is like the personification of ego.

133
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:17,600
Like it just, it does not matter.

134
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:18,880
Well, for some of us-

135
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:19,680
It just doesn't matter.

136
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:20,240
What?

137
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:24,720
Well, for some of us, ego has been what we've shaped our entire life around, Justin.

138
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:29,600
Well, it's a, trust me, that's a rickety bridge, man. You got to maybe check the supports on that one,

139
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:32,720
on that whole worldview. You can be a rickety bridge.

140
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:37,040
Travis also seems impossible to get, Travis seems impossible to get wrong too.

141
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:41,360
I've been called Trevor, Tarvis.

142
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:44,800
I've been called Tarvis, Targus, Targus.

143
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:48,560
The worst is when people try to make it like Travy, fuck it.

144
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:51,200
The worst is when people try to make it like Travy, fucking hate that.

145
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:52,240
Oh, that won't do.

146
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:57,120
It's just like an infantilization of my name. I'm a 32 year old man.

147
00:12:57,840 --> 00:13:01,920
When I call restaurants and I place orders,

148
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:07,520
do you guys want to guess what name they put down for me when they don't get it right?

149
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:08,960
And this is not a goof.

150
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:14,400
The name, I would say maybe 50, 50, 50% people hear Griffin and they say,

151
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:19,680
oh, I've heard that name before, the other half.

152
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:20,480
Anybody want to guess?

153
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:22,240
Jeffin.

154
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:25,200
No, Kristen, Kristen.

155
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:26,640
Kristen?

156
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:29,360
Hello, yes, this is Kristen.

157
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
Egg rolls, please. A hundred of them.

158
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:35,920
Kristen has an egg roll size hole in her belly, please.

159
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:39,760
Oh, this is a good little segue.

160
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:42,160
This Yahoo was sent by Eric Woods. Thank you, Eric.

161
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:44,960
It's Yahoo Answers user. Sorry, something's gone wrong.

162
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:47,680
Do a quick refresh of the page, see if we can't get the data to load.

163
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:49,680
And no, unfortunately it's still wrong.

164
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:50,560
It's from Kristen.

165
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:58,240
My alter ego asks, can you legally have a number in your name?

166
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:01,600
For example, if you are the fourth Peter in your family,

167
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:03,840
can you legally be called Peter four?

168
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:11,360
Now, not Peter the fourth, Peter four.

169
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:12,240
Peter four.

170
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:12,880
Petty four.

171
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:15,280
Can you legally have a number in your name?

172
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:16,640
It depends.

173
00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:19,920
Are you talking about, like, the number is pronounced?

174
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:24,720
Like, could you put an eight in there and just have that,

175
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:29,040
like, you know, pronounced as part of the pronunciation?

176
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:32,960
Oh, like if your name was-

177
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:34,960
Kate, and it was just like K-8.

178
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:36,320
Damn.

179
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:40,320
Damn, like, kind of give you, namely, a license play vibe.

180
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:44,800
I'm saying you could do, like, Caitlin and just like K-8-L-Y-N.

181
00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:48,160
Okay, but seriously now, can you put a number in your name?

182
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:49,680
Can you do that, though, for real, though?

183
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:51,600
Because they're characters.

184
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:53,440
They're on a keyboard.

185
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:54,080
Yeah.

186
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:54,800
The government.

187
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:56,320
I mean, the government on this one.

188
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:57,360
Do you think that they're so-

189
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:58,400
Okay, picture this.

190
00:14:58,400 --> 00:15:00,960
Honey, she's beautiful.

191
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:03,760
I think we're gonna go with Kristen Four.

192
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:06,400
No, shut it down.

193
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:06,640
What?

194
00:15:07,520 --> 00:15:08,640
How'd you get in here?

195
00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:09,840
I'm with the government.

196
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:12,000
You can't put a number in that baby's name.

197
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,200
It's Kristen the Fourth.

198
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:14,400
Now get out of the hospital.

199
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:15,680
We need it for somebody else.

200
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:18,960
One of the nurses in the birthing class yesterday

201
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:22,640
said they had a baby named Absid, which was literally A-B-C-D.

202
00:15:22,640 --> 00:15:23,360
Slam dunk.

203
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:25,280
Crushed it.

204
00:15:25,280 --> 00:15:26,160
I like that.

205
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:27,280
That's really good.

206
00:15:27,280 --> 00:15:27,760
What about Peter?

207
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:28,720
It is important.

208
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:30,240
When we were trying to come up with baby names,

209
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:32,240
we had the thought of what's a name that you could pick

210
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:35,360
that you couldn't turn into anything else

211
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:36,880
and that no one's used before.

212
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:39,360
Absid's pretty good.

213
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:40,400
Absid's pretty good, yeah.

214
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:42,160
Peter, I like this.

215
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:44,240
I like the idea of if you have a Peter

216
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:49,920
and you could do a shitty video game branding convention

217
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:53,040
where there's a game series called Thief,

218
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:53,920
the third Thief game.

219
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:56,080
It was T-H-I-3-F.

220
00:15:57,200 --> 00:15:58,160
Oh, god.

221
00:15:58,160 --> 00:15:58,800
I forgot that.

222
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:02,080
Thief, I think you just throw a three.

223
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:06,000
If you're the third Peter, you can be Pthreeter.

224
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:08,000
I'm Pthreeter.

225
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,280
That's a tight ass name, too.

226
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:09,760
I like that.

227
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:11,440
Yeah, Pthreeter.

228
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:14,480
But we know that they're the fourth.

229
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:15,920
You gotta get a four in there somewhere.

230
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:16,480
You're right.

231
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:17,760
Pthorder.

232
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:18,480
Pthorder.

233
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:22,720
It's pronounced Peter, but it says Pthorder.

234
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:23,120
I know.

235
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:24,800
I know what it says.

236
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:25,760
It's my fucking name.

237
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:27,200
You think I don't know what it says?

238
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:28,800
My dad Pthreeter named me.

239
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:31,440
But we have a thing.

240
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:37,920
The parallel that they draw is a weird example

241
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:39,840
because we have a thing for that.

242
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:43,600
We have a way to put numbers if you're the third or fourth

243
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:45,040
Peter in your family.

244
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:47,440
We have one of those.

245
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:50,240
Does it have to be a direct line of succession

246
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:52,080
in order to justify that, though?

247
00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:54,000
Can you just be like, this is the fourth time

248
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,840
we couldn't come up with anything better than Peter,

249
00:16:55,840 --> 00:16:58,400
so here it is presenting Peter.

250
00:16:58,400 --> 00:17:00,960
Justin, this is the classic James Bond,

251
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:02,800
James Bond Jr. conundrum.

252
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:05,440
Because James Bond Jr. was not James Bond's son.

253
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:06,560
Wait, what?

254
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:07,600
But rather his nephew.

255
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:08,480
No.

256
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:09,440
Yeah.

257
00:17:10,080 --> 00:17:10,320
No.

258
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:11,520
Yeah.

259
00:17:12,320 --> 00:17:14,720
No, I'm saying you're not wrong.

260
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:17,120
I'm saying no to just the whole thing.

261
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:20,240
I think even like Blofeld was like,

262
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:22,240
wait, that's not how that fucking works.

263
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:24,240
You can't do that.

264
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:28,320
How did they justify that in the canon of James Bond Jr.?

265
00:17:28,320 --> 00:17:29,680
His parents were real lazy.

266
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:33,280
Also, James Bond doesn't have a brother.

267
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:34,160
Wait, hold on.

268
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:34,880
Hold on.

269
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:36,720
Hold on, James Bond Jr. series.

270
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:39,200
James Bond doesn't have a brother or sister.

271
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:41,280
Lot of holes.

272
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:48,240
They had to have like dealt with that, right?

273
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:48,740
Right?

274
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:50,560
Hold on.

275
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:51,840
Hold on.

276
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:53,440
Why don't I know the answer to that?

277
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:54,400
I watched every episode.

278
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:56,560
Maybe it was just a young James Bond.

279
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:58,240
No, he was related.

280
00:17:58,880 --> 00:17:59,360
Damn it.

281
00:18:00,560 --> 00:18:03,840
Did James Bond ever roll up on the cartoon show James Bond Jr.?

282
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:07,680
And he was like, make sure you shoot them right in the brain.

283
00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:10,560
Anyway, time to go fuck.

284
00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:11,680
It's like, whoa, damn.

285
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:14,080
Have some gin.

286
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:15,120
But I'm 12.

287
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:15,680
I can't.

288
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:16,560
I can't have gin.

289
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:18,240
I don't care.

290
00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:19,440
Drink it.

291
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:23,840
No, okay, I don't have any idea.

292
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:27,040
Like it is not covered and also no one.

293
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:27,540
Okay.

294
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:29,920
The son of David Bond.

295
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:32,640
Hello, I'm Dave Bond.

296
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:33,840
Hey, I'm Dave Bond.

297
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:35,040
What are you naming your son?

298
00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:35,840
David Jr.?

299
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:38,480
Well, James, actually, it's funny.

300
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:39,440
You should ask.

301
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:45,920
I got this is gonna come off a little weird, but his name is James Bond Jr.

302
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:47,440
What are you talking about?

303
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:48,320
Crikey.

304
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:49,760
This is my new British accent.

305
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:50,080
Yeah.

306
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:53,840
Well, I just thought, you want him?

307
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:55,620
What?

308
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:59,280
It's funny that we're talking about this because I've actually

309
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:00,560
wanted to talk to you boys about this.

310
00:19:00,560 --> 00:19:04,640
I think I'm gonna name my son Justin Travis McElroy Jr.

311
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:08,400
So is that, are we good?

312
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:08,960
Are we good?

313
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:10,400
Am I good?

314
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:13,360
Honestly, can I just tweet that out real quick?

315
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:14,640
Because I'm like so honored by it.

316
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:17,920
Uh, maybe sit on the tweet.

317
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:24,160
We're waiting for the social, our social media manager, Bryson, to work up a package.

318
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:29,920
Can I read just one sentence from the James Bond Jr. Wikipedia page?

319
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:32,640
Oh, Travis, that's the rest of the episode.

320
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:37,760
Alternatively, it has been proposed that Fleming's James Bond had a brother

321
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:41,600
also named James Bond, who is the father of James Bond Jr.

322
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:48,480
Alternately, it was proposed by an idiot, a popular, well-known idiot with a platform.

323
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:49,920
What the fuck?

324
00:19:50,560 --> 00:19:52,560
These are my son, James.

325
00:19:52,560 --> 00:19:52,880
What?

326
00:19:54,080 --> 00:20:00,080
And his friend's IQ, the grandson of Q, not how that naming convention works either.

327
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:05,040
And his friend Gordo Lighter, the son of Felix Lighter.

328
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:07,680
This show is whack.

329
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:12,320
I'm James, this is my dad, David Bond, and my best friend Gordo.

330
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:17,920
I'm the creator of this show has never seen James Bond movies before in action.

331
00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:19,440
He chases scum around the world.

332
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:23,040
That's the only thing I remember about James Bond Jr. character.

333
00:20:23,040 --> 00:20:23,920
How about another question?

334
00:20:24,560 --> 00:20:26,320
Yeah, here it comes.

335
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:29,760
And Goldfinger has a teenage daughter named Goldy Finger.

336
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:30,640
What the fuck?

337
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:31,120
That's gross.

338
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:32,400
That's like not great.

339
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:33,760
Oh no.

340
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:35,920
That's really not actually excellent.

341
00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:38,960
Enjoy high school, Goldy Finger.

342
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:41,760
Oh no.

343
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:42,000
No.

344
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:46,400
So you're really naming, I'm really naming her that.

345
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:53,040
But you understand that, yes, I've looked through all of it.

346
00:20:53,040 --> 00:20:54,880
I know exactly what it means, yes.

347
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:55,840
I know what I'm doing.

348
00:20:57,280 --> 00:20:59,680
Goldfinger, do you not remember what high school was like?

349
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:01,200
Yes, it was awesome.

350
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:03,920
It was awesome.

351
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:06,080
No, I remember exactly.

352
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:08,720
I wanted to grow up strong.

353
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:12,480
Also, Goldfinger was his fucking last name.

354
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:13,760
Yeah.

355
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:16,080
His name was Arik Goldfinger.

356
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:19,200
You can't name your daughter Goldy Finger.

357
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:23,040
They're really playing fast and loose in the James Bond Jr. writers room.

358
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:25,280
So stupid, okay.

359
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:26,080
So stupid.

360
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:27,120
All right, here's a question.

361
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:28,000
God, I'm too mad.

362
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:30,000
Oh boy.

363
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:35,600
When I use the stall at work, some office prankster likes to come in and use an app

364
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:37,680
on their phone to create fart noises.

365
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:40,160
Pretty good.

366
00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:43,120
Then when they have finished, they leave, turning out the light.

367
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:44,720
How do I get them to stop this?

368
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:47,680
Please help me bring peace and quiet back to the bathroom.

369
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:49,360
That's from Disturbing Detroit.

370
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:52,240
And fucking obviously this is camouflage.

371
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:57,680
They're obviously socially uncomfortable with the idea that someone is listening to them

372
00:21:57,680 --> 00:22:02,400
do the damn thing and they have created, they have probably not created.

373
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:05,040
They probably just downloaded this app to help them.

374
00:22:05,040 --> 00:22:08,720
No, they develop their own fart piano.

375
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:13,600
They still can valid up a new program to fart when they fart.

376
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:14,560
There's a lot of sensors.

377
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:17,360
Are you making any kind of, maybe they're turning off the light.

378
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:19,040
They don't even know you're there.

379
00:22:19,040 --> 00:22:20,800
No, they always, they do it every time.

380
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:22,480
Then they're Jamie fucking Kennedy.

381
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:26,480
Meaning they're Jamie Kennedy Jr.

382
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:34,000
I just like, can we just do this question and never deal with it again?

383
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:37,920
And then like, maybe this will be our first viral thing where it gets picked up.

384
00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:49,440
And our message can just be like, in the bathroom, keep it cool in the toilet area.

385
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:52,400
Yeah, just like get in.

386
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:53,440
How many questions do we get?

387
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:54,640
Like people try to talk to me.

388
00:22:54,640 --> 00:23:00,080
People just get in, do the damn thing and get the fuck out.

389
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:07,360
This is the crazy, this is the most, it's a place where you make yourself vulnerable

390
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:10,240
and then you do the dirtiest thing you do.

391
00:23:11,040 --> 00:23:13,760
Can we not do a tight five in there?

392
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:17,280
And also literally everyone fucking does it.

393
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:21,040
So this idea of like, I'm uncomfortable in the bathroom.

394
00:23:21,040 --> 00:23:26,000
Like this jokester who's in there pranking you and turning off the lights.

395
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,720
They're also doing stuff in the bathroom.

396
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:32,080
Why can't we all have a little bit of human compassion for one another

397
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:36,560
and recognize that the thing we're doing is in many ways the worst.

398
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:38,880
See, human compassion does not fit.

399
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:47,040
Okay, to me, the bathroom is the break room from being a human being.

400
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:52,640
I have seen people I've known my entire life in the bathroom

401
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:57,600
and we have let it pass without any hint of acknowledgement.

402
00:23:57,600 --> 00:24:00,720
I've been in like at an event where I've ended up in the bathroom

403
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:02,400
at the same time as a famous person.

404
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:07,360
They are not, to me, it's not like I'm polite and I just, no, they're not.

405
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:08,880
They're not a person right then.

406
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:09,680
None of us are people.

407
00:24:09,680 --> 00:24:11,920
We're taking a break from society right now.

408
00:24:11,920 --> 00:24:13,600
We're like, we don't have to interact.

409
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:14,800
We don't have to do anything.

410
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:20,560
It's a sacred time of not fucking talking or looking at each other, period, the end.

411
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:22,800
I took a piss next to Paul Simon once.

412
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:25,440
He may as well have been a stack of shoe boxes.

413
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:26,720
I don't give a fuck.

414
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:28,240
Mine's Lou Diamond Phillips.

415
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:30,640
And he might as well have been a picture of Lou Diamond Phillips

416
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:32,640
just on the urinal next to me.

417
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:37,600
Now, can we take a moment and figure out why that picture was hung up?

418
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:42,560
Enjoy this LDP while you do your LDP.

419
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,040
Low down dirty poop.

420
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:46,800
God.

421
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:56,640
Yeah, just we are all just primitive boxes in there.

422
00:24:56,640 --> 00:25:02,560
We are all just, we are just husks doing our caveman stuff.

423
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:08,480
Please don't, the ladder of awful things you can do is like,

424
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:12,880
it starts with innocuous stuff like don't hand out mints in there.

425
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:17,600
I'm sorry that somebody either hired you or invited you to do this,

426
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:22,560
but it is a trespass upon me and my safe space.

427
00:25:22,560 --> 00:25:24,480
Oh, I have a money making scheme for that.

428
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:25,280
Just encourage me.

429
00:25:25,280 --> 00:25:28,160
Stand outside the bathroom door and everybody who walks in

430
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:29,760
tell them if you don't give me a dollar,

431
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:30,560
I'm gonna come in there and hand out mints.

432
00:25:30,560 --> 00:25:31,760
I'm gonna go in there with you.

433
00:25:35,920 --> 00:25:40,240
Could we, oh man, guys, oh man, guys.

434
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:41,600
What?

435
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:43,360
Here's a money making idea.

436
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:46,880
You walk into the bathroom.

437
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:49,120
What's the first thing you see on your left?

438
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:52,720
It's a rack full of Phantom of the Opera masks.

439
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:57,040
You throw one of those little, you throw one of those bad boys on

440
00:25:57,040 --> 00:25:58,720
or maybe you bring your own from home

441
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:00,480
and then you can have your own sort of, well, no,

442
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:01,440
you can't bring your own from home.

443
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:03,520
It has to be, it has to promise anonymity.

444
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:05,920
All of these beautiful masquerade masks.

445
00:26:05,920 --> 00:26:09,040
Turn every, turn every bathroom into eyes wide shut.

446
00:26:09,680 --> 00:26:09,920
Yeah.

447
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:13,200
Except that it's literally like we're pretending

448
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:15,600
like all of our eyes are just shut.

449
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:16,720
It's just eyes shut.

450
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:22,240
God, I mean, if we could, if we could figure out a way to like,

451
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:24,640
okay, another solution is you walk into the bathroom

452
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:26,400
and there's blindfolds and you put those on

453
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:29,200
and then there's like a string that you follow

454
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:32,640
to either, you know, Browntown or to either,

455
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:35,200
which of the different toilets there are.

456
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:38,720
Maybe, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

457
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:41,360
Another money making idea, bathroom bouncer.

458
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:44,160
Okay, okay.

459
00:26:44,160 --> 00:26:45,920
And they've got like a rope and they're like,

460
00:26:45,920 --> 00:26:48,800
now we're at capacity, gotta wait till someone else comes out.

461
00:26:48,800 --> 00:26:48,960
Yeah.

462
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:50,240
That kind of, you know, and it's also,

463
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:51,440
that's gotta make it feel cool.

464
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:54,160
And then if somebody flips off the light and he's like,

465
00:26:54,160 --> 00:26:57,280
oh no, you're not allowed back at the bathroom ever again.

466
00:26:58,160 --> 00:26:59,200
In any bathroom.

467
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:00,960
In any bathroom, I'm gonna spread the word.

468
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:04,320
I have a, we, we, when we were shooting our TV show,

469
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:08,560
there was a, there was probably 20 people,

470
00:27:08,560 --> 00:27:10,800
I would guess working on it at the same time

471
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:14,400
in one building that had one toilet to spare.

472
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:17,200
So basically anytime you went to use the bathroom,

473
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:19,840
you were doing like the knob turn,

474
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:24,480
oh, there's like knock occupied and then having to move away.

475
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:29,040
My question is, how far do you have to move away?

476
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:33,600
Do you guys do the thing where you move away so far

477
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:37,440
that you couldn't conceivably have been the mystery knocker?

478
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:40,160
The person who is like, like I've gone so far

479
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:43,120
as to like look around as though I've just seen the person

480
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:46,480
that knocked on them, like get away from me again.

481
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:48,400
Like I was trying to get tabs on him.

482
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:50,960
Like, well, he went that way boss, go get him.

483
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:52,880
Oh yeah, he ran right through you.

484
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:54,800
He's dressed like a real perv.

485
00:27:54,800 --> 00:27:56,480
When they walk out of the bathroom,

486
00:27:56,480 --> 00:27:58,800
I am on my phone making a fake phone call.

487
00:27:58,800 --> 00:28:01,280
And as they walk by me, I'll say something like,

488
00:28:01,280 --> 00:28:03,360
it's been so nice talking to you for 20 minutes.

489
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:07,040
I will often do a full pantomimus though.

490
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:08,800
I've just realized I need to go to the right,

491
00:28:08,800 --> 00:28:10,880
even if no one else is around, just in case.

492
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:13,280
Like it's sort of like, oh, were you just in the bathroom?

493
00:28:13,280 --> 00:28:16,080
You know, now that you mentioned it, I could bathroom.

494
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:17,360
Yeah, I could go.

495
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:20,400
Yeah, oh, cause there's nothing worse than like,

496
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:24,960
they walk out and I have just through contrivances

497
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:27,360
and situations that befall us all,

498
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:29,920
have been too close to the bathroom after that.

499
00:28:29,920 --> 00:28:31,200
And then when the person comes out,

500
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:32,640
they're like, it's all yours.

501
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:34,000
Like the worst.

502
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:34,640
No, I don't.

503
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:35,520
What did you do?

504
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:37,120
What did you do to prepare it for me?

505
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:39,200
What ceremony is prepared?

506
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,960
This is not, yeah, this is not like a giant robot

507
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:44,080
that you've been piloting

508
00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:45,920
that I am now taking on the legacy of.

509
00:28:45,920 --> 00:28:48,880
This is a toilet that we use for shame.

510
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:50,240
Justin, use my mech.

511
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:52,320
You have to, you have to finish the fight.

512
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:53,360
That's a good thing to say.

513
00:28:53,360 --> 00:28:54,240
Finish the fight.

514
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:56,240
Finish the fight, bro.

515
00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:57,520
This one's for all of us.

516
00:28:57,520 --> 00:28:58,800
This is a good opportunity for me

517
00:28:58,800 --> 00:29:00,080
to have a little press conference for you,

518
00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:02,480
my two brothers, because Justin was not joking.

519
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:05,040
We had one toilet for all 20 of us

520
00:29:05,040 --> 00:29:07,440
for three weeks while we were shooting the show.

521
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:09,680
And at one point the toilet seat broke.

522
00:29:09,680 --> 00:29:10,880
It came off the hinge

523
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:12,960
and was just kind of a free floating situation.

524
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:14,320
And ladies and gentlemen,

525
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:15,920
thank you for gathering here today.

526
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:19,200
It is with much sorrow that I admit

527
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:21,120
that I was the one who did break the toilet seat

528
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:22,960
for everybody.

529
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:24,400
And I never admitted it

530
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:26,960
and nobody ever fixed the toilet seat.

531
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:28,160
We did get another toilet seat

532
00:29:28,160 --> 00:29:29,760
and I thought like, boy, I broke it.

533
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:32,640
I should really take it on myself to put it on there.

534
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:33,840
But here's the thing.

535
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:36,480
I used my foot to open and close toilet lids

536
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:39,040
because I'm not some sort of wild animal.

537
00:29:39,040 --> 00:29:44,640
And I guess I did like sort of a hard bicycle kick

538
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:48,720
and it disrupted the machinery.

539
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:50,400
And so I apologize

540
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:52,480
and I hope that we can all come together

541
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:53,680
as a country to find a way forward.

542
00:29:53,680 --> 00:29:54,400
Thank you very much.

543
00:29:56,240 --> 00:29:57,360
No questions at this time.

544
00:29:57,360 --> 00:30:09,360
All right, let's let the healing begin in the money zone.

545
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:14,560
Do you guys wanna know what I had for dinner last night?

546
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:16,480
Not especially.

547
00:30:17,280 --> 00:30:18,080
Yes, I do.

548
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:23,520
In great detail, pan-seared cod.

549
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:24,000
Slower.

550
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:27,920
With udon noodles served in a-

551
00:30:27,920 --> 00:30:29,840
That is not how that word is pronounced,

552
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:31,120
even close to it.

553
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:33,600
Udon, ayudon noodles.

554
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:34,640
No, I'm not Don.

555
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:36,160
Thank you for asking though.

556
00:30:36,160 --> 00:30:37,760
Ayudon noodles.

557
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:39,840
I'm Dizerone.

558
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:45,440
Shiitake broth and some very other good flavors

559
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:47,600
to enjoy with a relish.

560
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:48,640
I believe so.

561
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:49,760
Yes, thank you.

562
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:53,920
Two scoops of that over at table Justin.

563
00:30:53,920 --> 00:30:55,600
Oh, my regards to the chef.

564
00:30:56,640 --> 00:30:59,440
My compliments to him on this perfection

565
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:00,880
served on a platter.

566
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:02,240
Who's the chef for this one?

567
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:05,520
Well, consider me abashed

568
00:31:05,520 --> 00:31:08,880
because it is I, Justin, or Chef Justin

569
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:10,160
as I prefer to be called

570
00:31:10,160 --> 00:31:10,720
when I'm wearing my hat and says that.

571
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:12,160
Are you in a fugue state?

572
00:31:12,160 --> 00:31:12,800
What are you doing?

573
00:31:12,800 --> 00:31:14,880
You made dinner but you don't remember it?

574
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:17,840
Yeah, that's how good it was

575
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:20,960
because I convinced myself that no one could have made,

576
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:24,160
no person that was me could have made this Blue Apron meal.

577
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:25,440
That's right, it's Blue Apron

578
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:27,360
that turned me into a chef magically,

579
00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:29,440
so magical I don't remember the details.

580
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:32,000
You sound like a drunk chopped contestant.

581
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,480
Like it's noodles with flavor.

582
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:39,440
So Blue Apron is a service that will,

583
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:42,320
you sign up for it and they send you boxes

584
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:45,040
with meals in it that you get to make yourself

585
00:31:45,040 --> 00:31:46,560
and they're really like good meals.

586
00:31:46,560 --> 00:31:48,480
Like I just described one

587
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:50,880
and then there's Thai green curry chicken

588
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:52,640
and squash with the yu choy.

589
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:53,680
That was in September.

590
00:31:53,680 --> 00:31:55,440
Roasted pork steam buns.

591
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:56,960
I love the steam buns, man.

592
00:31:56,960 --> 00:31:58,160
You can't get those around here.

593
00:31:58,160 --> 00:31:59,040
So it's really nice.

594
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:00,480
Like there's a lot of stuff.

595
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:01,280
I live in West Virginia.

596
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:03,840
There's a lot of stuff like I literally don't have access to

597
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:05,760
like produce that I don't have access to

598
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:06,880
and that kind of thing.

599
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:08,800
So it's really cool to be able

600
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:10,560
to get the experience of making those.

601
00:32:10,560 --> 00:32:12,480

They don't even say to say this anymore

636
00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:23,360
but build it beautiful.

637
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:25,840
Maybe they're moving away.

638
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:27,040
They're rebranding.

639
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:28,000
They can't.

640
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:29,280
You can't take that from me.

641
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:33,280
Do you remember when Pepsi used to be Pepsi?

642
00:33:33,280 --> 00:33:34,400
America's Pepsi.

643
00:33:35,120 --> 00:33:36,320
And that was their tagline?

644
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:38,400
And now every time I think of Pepsi

645
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:40,320
it's like Pepsi America's Pepsi.

646
00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:45,920
I think the tagline was I think the tagline was Pepsi.

647
00:33:45,920 --> 00:33:46,880
It's better Coke.

648
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:49,920
Do you remember when Dr. Bell.

649
00:33:49,920 --> 00:33:51,040
Oh sorry go ahead.

650
00:33:51,040 --> 00:33:53,280
Dr. Pepper had one and it was like Dr. Pepper

651
00:33:53,280 --> 00:33:54,400
the other brown stuff.

652
00:33:55,040 --> 00:33:55,920
And they said that.

653
00:33:55,920 --> 00:33:57,440
And now like every time I drink a Dr. Pepper

654
00:33:57,440 --> 00:33:59,120
I'm like that is the other brown stuff.

655
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,400
Do you remember when Taco Bell invented tacos

656
00:34:02,400 --> 00:34:05,040
and had to sell them to a hungry nation in the 60s?

657
00:34:05,040 --> 00:34:06,720
And the tagline was Taco Bell.

658
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:08,400
It's like a hamburger flipped in half.

659
00:34:08,400 --> 00:34:10,320
There's no one that ever had them.

660
00:34:11,680 --> 00:34:12,880
Yeah that was crazy.

661
00:34:12,880 --> 00:34:13,840
I'm so glad they invented it.

662
00:34:13,840 --> 00:34:18,320
We have a message for John from Kitty and Ten.

663
00:34:19,920 --> 00:34:22,960
Congratulations to the okayest dungeon master ever

664
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:25,120
for acquiring your first home.

665
00:34:25,120 --> 00:34:27,520
That's all we have to say but the more I type

666
00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:29,600
the less each word costs.

667
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:32,800
I've got it down to two dollars and eight cents.

668
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:36,320
All the best Kitty Purry and Den Visa.

669
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:38,880
Oh god when you break down the math like that

670
00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:41,280
it really makes me question the sort of

671
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:44,640
efficiency of some of it.

672
00:34:44,640 --> 00:34:47,600
Well that and also like you just I would

673
00:34:47,600 --> 00:34:50,160
if the next Jumbotron I just want it to be like

674
00:34:50,160 --> 00:34:51,760
no articles.

675
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:55,520
No just like conjunctions in every single word

676
00:34:55,520 --> 00:34:56,480
to just like squeeze.

677
00:34:59,120 --> 00:35:01,760
It reminds me of that that 1-800 collect commercial

678
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:03,600
it's like we oughta baby eat Subway.

679
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:04,320
You remember that?

680
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:05,840
Oh it was a good commercial.

681
00:35:05,840 --> 00:35:06,400
That was good.

682
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:10,560
I don't think we had a baby.

683
00:35:10,560 --> 00:35:11,920
It's a boy was the tagline.

684
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:15,280
Rolling that commercial because it's like

685
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:17,920
what a cheap man to spin the quarter.

686
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:18,880
You just had a baby.

687
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:19,920
It's a boy.

688
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:20,640
Spin the quarter.

689
00:35:20,640 --> 00:35:21,600
Call your folks.

690
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:23,440
Oh my god.

691
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:26,400
I haven't thought about that fucking commercial yet.

692
00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:29,440
I haven't thought about the idea of collect calls

693
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:30,800
in probably a decade.

694
00:35:33,120 --> 00:35:34,800
Wow times huh.

695
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:37,440
The time as they are changing.

696
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:40,720
This message is for Sarah and it's from Team Chicago

697
00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:44,240
which is apparently made up of Lauren Shell and Jess.

698
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:46,880
The 2016 Chicago Bulls.

699
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:49,280
Lauren Shell and Jess.

700
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:51,200
That's right they're going with a three person

701
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:53,520
basketball team which is unconventional.

702
00:35:56,880 --> 00:35:59,200
Sarah without you our nails would be ragged.

703
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:01,280
Our skeeball teams would be sadder.

704
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:03,600
And our party drinks would be flatter.

705
00:36:03,600 --> 00:36:06,720
Happy belated birthday to our favorite mixologist

706
00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:08,320
and Swasomest friend.

707
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:09,680
We love you.

708
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:13,040
To be fair they just said Swasom friend

709
00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:15,200
so she might not be there Swasomest.

710
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:17,120
Yeah sure.

711
00:36:17,120 --> 00:36:19,520
I don't want to put words in Team Chicago's mouth.

712
00:36:21,520 --> 00:36:22,960
Sarah it sounds like provides

713
00:36:23,840 --> 00:36:26,560
and I try not to look at human beings this pragmatically

714
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:29,360
but just like a lot of functionality.

715
00:36:29,360 --> 00:36:30,160
Oh yeah.

716
00:36:30,160 --> 00:36:31,840
Like my nails are looking good.

717
00:36:31,840 --> 00:36:33,520
My drink is very much on point.

718
00:36:33,520 --> 00:36:36,720
And what's that in the skeeball hole the 100.1?

719
00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:37,760
It's a ball.

720
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:38,720
Sarah put it there.

721
00:36:38,720 --> 00:36:39,040
Damn.

722
00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:40,880
Damn Sarah.

723
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:43,520
Now just to be fair Griffin it doesn't say that she

724
00:36:43,520 --> 00:36:45,920
brings any kind of skill to the skeeball

725
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:47,840
but rather just makes them happy.

726
00:36:47,840 --> 00:36:50,880
So she might be like kind of you know like a mascot.

727
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:53,040
Maybe she's not good at skeeball at all

728
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:55,840
but rather she's got a lot of skeeball puns

729
00:36:55,840 --> 00:36:57,200
that every time she breaks them out

730
00:36:57,200 --> 00:36:59,920
everyone groans a little bit but they also smile and laugh too.

731
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:02,080
Like they get it.

732
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:06,720
Tai is a pedantic person.

733
00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:08,800
I think when he pronounces these words

734
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:11,040
it's in a very show-offy way.

735
00:37:11,680 --> 00:37:12,480
Jairo.

736
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:13,360
Yiro.

737
00:37:13,360 --> 00:37:14,400
Sacrebleu.

738
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:15,360
Sacrebleu.

739
00:37:15,360 --> 00:37:16,400
Ayers Rock.

740
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:17,040
Uluru.

741
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,400
What you are witnessing is real.

742
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:24,640
The participants are not actors.

743
00:37:24,640 --> 00:37:27,120
They are actual litigants with real cases.

744
00:37:27,120 --> 00:37:30,960
They call in via Skype to Judge John Hodgman's court.

745
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:32,960
The real people's court.

746
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:36,560
Now I call you to Judge John Hodgman's internet court.

747
00:37:36,560 --> 00:37:40,880
Find it at Maximumfun.org or wherever you download podcasts.

748
00:37:43,840 --> 00:37:45,680
Hey I've got a Yahoo here.

749
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:47,520
Oh I've been hoping you would say that.

750
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:49,120
It's someone sent in by Sarah Urias.

751
00:37:49,120 --> 00:37:49,600
Thank you Sarah.

752
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:50,800
It's by Yahoo Answers user.

753
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:51,680
They're anonymous.

754
00:37:51,680 --> 00:37:56,400
This platform is just quicksand.

755
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:58,880
It's just sucking down.

756
00:37:58,880 --> 00:38:00,000
It's just disappearing.

757
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:02,880
This anonymous user asks,

758
00:38:03,680 --> 00:38:04,960
did cavemen cry?

759
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:07,040
Did cavemen cry?

760
00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:09,120
Wow.

761
00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:10,240
Did cavemen cry?

762
00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:12,880
Yeah but did cavemen cry?

763
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:16,000
Here's cavemen.

764
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:17,440
Uh huh.

765
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:18,720
Things they had to worry about.

766
00:38:18,720 --> 00:38:20,240
One, fighting dinosaurs.

767
00:38:20,240 --> 00:38:21,760
Defo.

768
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:23,760
Nonstop.

769
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:25,760
Left and right.

770
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:26,960
Left and right.

771
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:28,800
Dinos, dinos, dinos, dinos, dinos.

772
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:32,800
It was like Jurassic World up in there but for real this time.

773
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:36,000
Fighting dinos just to survive.

774
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:37,600
And I think when that's happening.

775
00:38:37,600 --> 00:38:39,600
Oh also other things they were worried about.

776
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:43,760
Playing funny ribcage xylophones.

777
00:38:46,640 --> 00:38:49,200
Grunting at each other and trying to make sense of what

778
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:51,840
augment in different contexts.

779
00:38:51,840 --> 00:38:56,800
Making just really shitty art on cave walls.

780
00:38:56,800 --> 00:38:57,840
Yeah good work guys.

781
00:38:57,840 --> 00:38:59,520
Yeah put it, where should we put my art?

782
00:38:59,520 --> 00:39:00,640
I'm gonna work really hard on it.

783
00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:02,320
It's the first art anyone's ever done.

784
00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:05,600
How about inside of this cave where nobody will ever come?

785
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:07,760
Yeah that sounds, it seems good to me.

786
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:10,640
What they don't tell you about cave art is that

787
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:15,040
cavemen would only do it at their friends houses as a prank.

788
00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:16,320
Like you would come home and be like,

789
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:20,720
uh god damn it Augg what is this?

790
00:39:20,720 --> 00:39:26,480
God damn it Jamie Kennedy senior, senior, senior, senior, senior, senior, senior, senior, senior.

791
00:39:26,480 --> 00:39:27,840
Come clean this up.

792
00:39:27,840 --> 00:39:29,440
This is uh this is terrible.

793
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:31,520
This doesn't look like anything.

794
00:39:32,240 --> 00:39:35,440
What if cavemen just cried like at the drop of a hat?

795
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:36,400
A lot yeah.

796
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:37,600
All the fucking time.

797
00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:39,760
I got you this uh new bone.

798
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:46,800
I saw it was crazy I saw a fucking huge dinosaur today.

799
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:51,680
Did you check out that mastodon over there?

800
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:54,480
Beautiful masto.

801
00:39:55,280 --> 00:39:57,120
Do you think they're like,

802
00:39:57,120 --> 00:40:00,880
I bet that there was probably a situation where they got to become like really good

803
00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:05,040
friends with the dinosaur uh and like they would pet them all the time but then their

804
00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:08,160
family would be like very hungry and they would have to like,

805
00:40:08,160 --> 00:40:12,480
and the dinosaur is very hungry too and they had to make that decision like do I feed my

806
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:17,920
family to the dinosaur or vice versa and also it's the last dinosaur.

807
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:23,040
Oh cool yeah and he's like as he's clubbing and he's like I'm sorry Grog sorry.

808
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:32,400
Can you imagine how fucking annoying sidebar can you imagine how fucking annoying the meetings

809
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:39,120
the meetings would have been when a bunch of cavemen decided to create language like

810
00:40:39,120 --> 00:40:46,880
let's call this one an apple like like no that's a terrible name for it it's a it has wings and it

811
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:50,880
looks like a mouse with wings they can't call it an apple let's call it something else let's call

812
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:54,640
it a bat they were just picking that shit from whole cloth yeah like that that must have been

813
00:40:54,640 --> 00:40:55,440
infuriating.

814
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:57,520
Can we just call it all rocks?

815
00:40:57,520 --> 00:41:00,720
No we can't just call everything rocks Doug.

816
00:41:00,720 --> 00:41:04,560
Well everything is made out of rocks pretty much right like everything is just different

817
00:41:04,560 --> 00:41:08,160
size and shaped rocks you got to think long term Doug.

818
00:41:09,520 --> 00:41:14,640
Can you imagine being the first caveman to cry like maybe something like fall and just

819
00:41:14,640 --> 00:41:16,960
like water starts streaming from your eyeballs?

820
00:41:16,960 --> 00:41:23,600
Yeah what the fuck is Jerry even doing right now I don't know I got so bummed that I just

821
00:41:23,600 --> 00:41:24,560
started gushing.

822
00:41:27,280 --> 00:41:28,880
From these orbs in my face.

823
00:41:28,880 --> 00:41:29,840
Please.

824
00:41:29,840 --> 00:41:33,040
Yeah from these things that I don't know what they do when I poke them it hurts I don't

825
00:41:33,040 --> 00:41:37,200
know I don't know I'm stupid as hell when I go like this I can't see the dinosaurs anymore

826
00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:43,120
so I guess they're eyes anyway when I cry it's weird feels good as fuck to like really

827
00:41:43,120 --> 00:41:48,640
get it out there because we're all under a lot of duress and it we live to be 11 years

828
00:41:48,640 --> 00:41:52,960
old and so like there's kind of a lot going on right now and when I do this and I gush

829
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:57,280
from my eyes I guess it feels good as fuck.

830
00:41:57,280 --> 00:42:03,360
Feels really good I just kind of sit down and take like one second off of like hunting

831
00:42:03,360 --> 00:42:09,200
and killing things and I just have like a moment for me where like I gush from these

832
00:42:09,200 --> 00:42:14,560
eye things and suddenly it's like oh yeah that was I don't know what's the word cathartic

833
00:42:14,560 --> 00:42:15,920
I just made that up.

834
00:42:15,920 --> 00:42:18,560
I just made that one up that's a crazy word I made up.

835
00:42:18,560 --> 00:42:22,960
Excuse me Philip I hate to interrupt I've been trying to do it I've been thinking like

836
00:42:22,960 --> 00:42:28,400
just like squeezing them and poking them and but I can't I'm not gushing like what's

837
00:42:28,400 --> 00:42:31,200
well maybe it's because you're a failure and you're bad at it.

838
00:42:31,840 --> 00:42:35,920
Wait hold on let me try let me try something and then he lets a velociraptor into eat

839
00:42:35,920 --> 00:42:40,720
your dad and it's like how about now yeah I'm gushing this is crazy it feels so good.

840
00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:47,440
Does the velociraptor get away with it or well no he goes to prison.

841
00:42:47,440 --> 00:43:03,200
Yeah cavemen cavemen cried if dogs cry right dogs cry sometimes I think cavemen probably

842
00:43:03,200 --> 00:43:03,920
did it.

843
00:43:03,920 --> 00:43:10,960
Cavemen didn't cry because cavemen were the luckiest phase of humanity ever because

844
00:43:10,960 --> 00:43:18,000
cavemen were the only listen I can prove this scientifically cavemen were the only

845
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:26,240
time of any of our species history one of the very much only times when they didn't

846
00:43:26,240 --> 00:43:32,960
live among dinosaurs but were too stupid to realize that they could have with the things

847
00:43:32,960 --> 00:43:37,520
that shook them out just a bit differently like they missed the dinosaurs too like I

848
00:43:37,520 --> 00:43:42,000
miss them as well but I have to look at like their bones and realize like fuck I could

849
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:46,560
have got a huge saddle and just like killed it out there they had no idea that they had

850
00:43:46,560 --> 00:43:53,200
missed out that was the last truly happy generation of humans like as soon as our like great awakening

851
00:43:53,200 --> 00:43:58,800
as a people was the first time somebody found like a giant tibia and was like oh fuck we

852
00:43:58,800 --> 00:44:05,840
fucked up we did it so bad just uh counterpoint they were also a generation where the leading

853
00:44:05,840 --> 00:44:12,160
cause of death was being devoured by a big and terrible dog and so I would argue that

854
00:44:12,160 --> 00:44:19,680
that wasn't so great and now we're worried about like not having internet and mean tweets

855
00:44:19,680 --> 00:44:25,840
and our millennials right huh the guy is so much better than cavemen and they don't even

856
00:44:25,840 --> 00:44:34,000
realize it I mean if I had to decide between people with anime avatars saying horrible

857
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:41,600
things to me on twitter or being devoured by a big and horrible dog I think I'd actually

858
00:44:41,600 --> 00:44:45,040
go with the dog thing because at least then it's over with and now I have to live with

859
00:44:45,040 --> 00:44:51,840
the weight of these anime avatars my girlfriend and I live in a basement apartment and our

860
00:44:51,840 --> 00:44:56,560
landlord lives upstairs we have a door in the backyard that goes to our carport and

861
00:44:56,560 --> 00:45:01,680
we drive frequently our landlord has two small dogs that poop in the backyard so whenever we

862
00:45:01,680 --> 00:45:06,720
come home from work late at night we can't see well enough and sometimes step in dog poop it's

863
00:45:06,720 --> 00:45:11,440
her private backyard so she's probably never had to clean up after them should we ask that she

864
00:45:11,440 --> 00:45:15,360
clean up her dog's poop or just walk around the house and coming through the front door

865
00:45:15,920 --> 00:45:21,040
that's from doo doo dilemma in dc there's just the point in here it's her private backyard so

866
00:45:21,040 --> 00:45:27,520
she's probably never had to clean up after them oh okay so another caveman question then cool two

867
00:45:27,520 --> 00:45:33,440
in a row what is that yard just belongs to the dogs no one else gets back there so i just let

868
00:45:33,440 --> 00:45:42,720
the dookie pile up i'm turning into a real junk pit what are you saying i just leave the dookie

869
00:45:42,720 --> 00:45:50,560
there forever yeah you do have to like even if you own the dogs you do accept that like

870
00:45:51,520 --> 00:45:57,280
this is diminishing the value of this as a yard whenever you leave the dookie out there

871
00:45:57,280 --> 00:46:03,680
let me take you on a tour or march on your calendar is one worst day ever of your life

872
00:46:03,680 --> 00:46:07,200
this is my this is my house is the new bathroom we just got it remodeled and really happy with

873
00:46:07,200 --> 00:46:11,440
that i got yeah porcelain features and then oh you're gonna love the backsplash in the kitchen

874
00:46:11,440 --> 00:46:19,040
and anyway um this is the shit field don't go into the shit field you just have a like a big

875
00:46:19,040 --> 00:46:28,240
part of your yeah it's about 1500 square feet and it's just an ocean of dookie that one cleanup

876
00:46:28,240 --> 00:46:35,520
once a year though that's rough yeah the reaping i can't come with you guys this week the dark

877
00:46:35,520 --> 00:46:41,200
harvest begins on friday and then i'll have to take a day off uh maybe a week off just to like

878
00:46:41,200 --> 00:46:46,720
throw up yeah i think you just i think you just chuck a molotov cocktail back there and see what

879
00:46:46,720 --> 00:46:54,320
happened pave it pave it pave it more dirt over it and then more grass and then you just keep

880
00:46:54,320 --> 00:46:59,280
building it up so eventually you just have like a mountain of shit in your back i think that's how

881
00:47:00,080 --> 00:47:06,960
like uh uh like those landfills work yeah i think that's how uh the plot of the movie poltergeist

882
00:47:06,960 --> 00:47:12,000
we're agree though that they cannot speak to their landlord about this right like there is

883
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:19,520
nothing that would upset me like if okay if my dog is pooping in the backyard and i'm just like

884
00:47:19,520 --> 00:47:24,320
living with that situation i have certainly done some soul searching prior to this about

885
00:47:25,200 --> 00:47:30,320
what sort of yard i want for myself what sort of yard i want to leave for my children and my

886
00:47:30,320 --> 00:47:35,680
children's children like i i think i've probably already made this life choice i don't need these

887
00:47:35,680 --> 00:47:39,760
young upstarts telling me what i should and shouldn't be doing with my poopy yard

888
00:47:39,760 --> 00:47:46,080
um yeah and also it's that's just a crazy thing to ask somebody hi i don't know you but i live in

889
00:47:46,080 --> 00:47:53,280
your house anyway touch shit touch touch shit touch it touch that shit go out there and get

890
00:47:53,280 --> 00:48:01,360
your hands get your grubby hands all over it maybe some kind of sky bridge now we're talking

891
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:07,840
you either need to touch shit or put in a state-of-the-art sky bridge i'm talking like

892
00:48:07,840 --> 00:48:13,840
high bridge maybe like a ski lift that just sort of lifts you over the dukey fields or like that

893
00:48:13,840 --> 00:48:18,000
thing that wayne zelinsky had in honey i shrunk the kid that like you just lay in and kind of

894
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:22,880
like pulley yourself across the yard and then you get on and it also helps you look for your

895
00:48:22,880 --> 00:48:29,680
miniature kids you remember god what if the kids from the kid shrinking movies and we cannot go

896
00:48:29,680 --> 00:48:35,280
off on another kid shrinking movie tangent again but what if this is where they got lost no

897
00:48:35,280 --> 00:48:42,800
no where are the kids they're they are they've they're better off dead at this point they're

898
00:48:42,800 --> 00:48:54,560
in they're lost in the shit fields oh god hey uh uh i have a uh vape confirmation by the way

899
00:48:54,560 --> 00:49:00,240
oh okay i didn't know this was a thing that we do on the show well this is one that we had

900
00:49:00,240 --> 00:49:05,920
discussed previously okay that i just wanted to put a pin in it because i got a text from

901
00:49:05,920 --> 00:49:12,240
my dear friend dwight slappy last night and it read thusly fyi john q sac was just caught vaping

902
00:49:12,240 --> 00:49:18,720
at the cubs game so that one is in the books that's an official like that i think he should

903
00:49:18,720 --> 00:49:24,160
actually be removed from which one vapes because that's an official one yeah it's just cheating i

904
00:49:24,160 --> 00:49:32,160
do want to hit you his jersey needs to get raised up into the rafters of which one you guys have a

905
00:49:32,160 --> 00:49:36,720
quick quick one because i didn't wander over the website while i was thinking about this and i did

906
00:49:36,720 --> 00:49:42,720
just want to hit you with this one montel williams versus tim curry which one vapes oh that's good

907
00:49:44,320 --> 00:49:50,720
now which one vapes though on that one does vape um i think tim curry tried it once and he said no

908
00:49:50,720 --> 00:49:59,360
i find it displeasurable uh expected winner was montel williams i think that's right yeah i think

909
00:49:59,360 --> 00:50:07,280
that one is is legit um alan cumming or mr t which one fuck that's a really alan cumming

910
00:50:08,960 --> 00:50:15,760
alan oh man oh man that's tough alan cumming can probably do cool like alan cumming definitely

911
00:50:15,760 --> 00:50:25,360
smoked analog and when he did that he probably could do cool like french smoke blow techniques

912
00:50:25,360 --> 00:50:32,400
and so i think that translates over to a vapor environment really really easily so i think you're

913
00:50:32,400 --> 00:50:41,040
really good at it i think it's alan okay fair enough it's mr t uh that just according to the

914
00:50:41,040 --> 00:50:47,520
science of which one vapes uh is mr t the whole time uh can we take it to the leaderboards mo

915
00:50:47,520 --> 00:50:51,120
real quick because yeah let's check the leaderboards i don't think there's been a lot

916
00:50:51,120 --> 00:50:56,960
of action uh but i do just want to recap number six most likely to vape rob kardashian number five

917
00:50:56,960 --> 00:51:04,480
ashton kutcher number four shyla buff uh number three macklemore number two chris angel i'm pretty

918
00:51:04,480 --> 00:51:10,880
sure this number one is new coming in with a bullet number one and it's basically absolutely

919
00:51:10,880 --> 00:51:18,560
so on point is dane cook um on on the number one uh number one least likely to vape right now is

920
00:51:18,560 --> 00:51:25,120
lana turner i think a lot of people use a cheap get out of jail free card with those least likely

921
00:51:25,120 --> 00:51:31,200
to vapes when they're i don't think you can assume that vape technology was not available

922
00:51:31,200 --> 00:51:36,080
in lana turner's time and that should like give her an out i think you need to just make the

923
00:51:36,080 --> 00:51:44,160
assumption debbie reynolds would have pulled down the thickest luscious cotton um by the way most

924
00:51:44,160 --> 00:51:50,160
likely brother to vape right now is travis excellent congrats i just i just don't see that

925
00:51:50,160 --> 00:51:55,680
but that's fine okay um i would i'm more of a second most likely i think but you know what

926
00:51:55,680 --> 00:52:03,360
i'm not here to judge that's what the website is for let's uh let's wrap it up huh i gotta go watch
