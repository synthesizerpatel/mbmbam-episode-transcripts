1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:30,800
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:50,560
Guys, I have breaking news from 22 Infinite Loop, or whatever the fuck Apple's address is.

6
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:53,440
This is my brother. My brother and me in advice for the modern era.

7
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:53,840
What's the news?

8
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:59,440
Let me break out this fucking tech news. I'm trying to get the SEO right,

9
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:02,400
and you're stepping on my... What are you doing?

10
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:03,920
That's the breaking news sound.

11
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:07,840
Yeah, that's the one we paid that studio thousands upon thousands of dollars to make,

12
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:11,040
and you got so mad at us because you said it sounded like us going boop-boop-boop-boop.

13
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:14,240
Here, let me hit play again, so you can do your breaking news.

14
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:19,920
Breaking news from 22 Infinite Loop. It's the new model of everyone's favorite touchable.

15
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:25,520
It's the guy phone. They changed it. It's the new model.

16
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:29,840
Going along just like Dr. Pepper and 7up. This is just for men.

17
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:35,040
Nope, that's not it. It's a little anthropomorphic phone. It lives in your pocket.

18
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:39,440
It's just a little guy. He's just a little guy. He lives in your pocket,

19
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:40,560
and he does all the things that iPhone 5 did.

20
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:42,400
Is he saved like a phone or a guy?

21
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:48,640
He is... Imagine a hybrid of both.

22
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:53,920
Okay, wait. Okay, wait, hold on. So like a phone with arms and legs,

23
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:56,240
or like a man with a phone for a face.

24
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:58,400
It does. It has appendages. Okay.

25
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:03,280
It has appendages, and it has a fleshy, scratch-resistant exterior.

26
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:08,160
The thing you should know about the appendages is that they are extremely breakable.

27
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:13,120
Oh my god. It's like Mr. Glass from Unbreakable.

28
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:14,640
You'll never stop hearing about it.

29
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:16,560
So be careful.

30
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:23,040
You have a phone call. Must be nice. I don't have arms. I'm guy phone.

31
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:27,040
Also, there's an unwrapped Starlight Mint in here. It's terrible in here.

32
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:27,840
It sucks.

33
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:31,280
Please don't leave your iPhone in a jar.

34
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,920
I need you to have baggy pants, please.

35
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:40,160
I need you to be the legend of baggy pants, and I need to ride around in there.

36
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:43,200
And if you could wrap me in pillows, I'm so fragile.

37
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:47,440
Did you want to apps? Did you want to Angry Birds on me?

38
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:49,760
Angry Birds on my tummy.

39
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:53,280
Angry Birds on my tummy? We used to Angry Birds all the time, Dave.

40
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:55,440
My battery's dying!

41
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:57,200
I'm dying.

42
00:02:58,720 --> 00:02:59,440
That's what I need.

43
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:03,040
I need a guy phone that can tell me when I shanked it on Super Stickman Golf,

44
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:06,160
even though I know. I know. I did. I know it.

45
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:10,960
Oh, a little high. A little too much mustard on that tomato.

46
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:12,320
Thanks, guy phone.

47
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:15,040
I would like a guy phone that was sitting there like,

48
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:18,320
hey, we're going karaokeing tonight. Don't you have to work tomorrow?

49
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:19,680
You really think it was a good idea?

50
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:23,600
Ew, gosh. I don't know. Better set an alarm on me now.

51
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:25,360
So what I want is a tiny pocket nanny.

52
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,080
Pocket nanny from the makers of guy phone.

53
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:30,640
My name is Justin McElroy, by the way.

54
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:32,080
I'm Travis McElroy.

55
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:36,000
I'm Griffin McElroy. Ten thousand dollars for the guy phone.

56
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:36,640
Does it make calls?

57
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:39,760
They have a cheaper model. It does not make calls, no.

58
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:40,160
It does not.

59
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:46,160
They have a cheaper model that doesn't make calls or have apps, and it's just a small man.

60
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:48,640
That's cheaper?

61
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:52,400
It's called the guy phone Stephen.

62
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:53,920
Neither are a phone.

63
00:03:53,920 --> 00:04:00,320
No, it's also not. It's not a living. It's a tiny. It's a little corpse.

64
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:01,200
Guy phone does.

65
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:03,520
Wait, guy phone Stephen is dead?

66
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:09,360
Yeah, it's a dead. It's a dead pygmy corpse and you carry it around and it doesn't have apps,

67
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:11,200
but you can still like play with it at the movies.

68
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:12,320
Does it ward off evil?

69
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:17,440
Doesn't do any of that. No, that's very, very nonfunctional, but it is cheaper than the guy

70
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:20,400
phone, so just food for thought.

71
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:23,600
Which as we've already established is pretty limited in terms of functionality already.

72
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:27,360
Listen, your kids are going to ask for the fucking guy phone for Christmas.

73
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:31,600
You don't have ten stacks to drop on each and every one of your seven kids,

74
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:34,320
so I've got a cheaper option for you.

75
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:36,160
We call it the guy phone Stephen.

76
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:40,720
Guy phone Stephen comes in a lot of different colors. He is a dead corpse.

77
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:45,120
He's a dead corpse. I'm not going to beat around the bush. We're selling you a corpse,

78
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:48,640
but it's cheaper than the guy phone, so you'll be able to fill all those Christmas wishes.

79
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:52,880
Great stocking stuffer. Guy phone Stephen's not going to complain about being stuffed.

80
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:57,280
He's got the same features as the guy phone. Very breakable, very brittle appendages.

81
00:04:57,280 --> 00:05:03,040
I'm ready to make a buy. How much do I have to lay down for guy phone Stephen?

82
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:05,680
Guy phone's $10,000. What's guy phone Stephen going to run me?

83
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:11,360
$14.99. $14.99 and you can have your own guy phone Stephen.

84
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:15,440
You are going to have to walk me through how we are not... I mean,

85
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:21,360
where are you finding these Lilliputians for your experiments,

86
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:23,360
and how are we not going to wipe out this resource?

87
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:29,520
I don't want to be accused of false advertising in saying that it is very much similar.

88
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:36,000
The guy phone Stephen is very similar to the guy phone. These are obviously failed guy phones.

89
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:42,560
These came out of the printing press a little sloppy.

90
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:46,480
So these are guy phones into which we were unable to breathe life.

91
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:52,800
Yes, they are. They are these half formed golems.

92
00:05:55,760 --> 00:06:02,480
They are lots of variation in the models. Some of them are very big, which people

93
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:08,080
aren't crazy about, just having these really big mutated corpses.

94
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:13,040
But $14.99 price it can't be beat coming out this November 32nd.

95
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:14,640
Get it. Get it.

96
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:15,360
Guy phone Stephen.

97
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:18,000
That's all for today, and now everybody Coolio.

98
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:23,440
I'm Coolio, and I'm here to say I like guy phone Stephen in a major way.

99
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:26,560
That's Coolio.

100
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:28,320
He has not missed a step.

101
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:33,120
He is still, and then he's going to drop in a fantastic voyage and lots of tiny Stevens

102
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:36,480
are going to just flop on the stage from the ceiling.

103
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:38,720
Be dropped like so much dead confetti.

104
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:42,640
Guys, how old do I have to be to call people in college kids?

105
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:47,440
I'm 25, and I really want to do that. That's from Caleb in New Zealand.

106
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:51,280
God, don't call anyone below 13 a kid.

107
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:55,200
I'm getting to that age where everyone's a kid to me now.

108
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:57,760
Yeah, but you don't hold on, but there's a difference.

109
00:06:57,760 --> 00:07:01,360
Are you like, are you specifically referring to someone like, look at that kid?

110
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:04,720
Are you saying like kids today or those college kids?

111
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:07,040
Cause I think that's a lot less. That's innocuous.

112
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:10,720
You know, say like college kids these days are like, well, I don't want to go hang out

113
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:15,200
with college kids at some college bar, but I think if you like point at a 22 year old

114
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:16,960
and you're like, look at this kid over here.

115
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:22,240
Like everyone is a kid because every, the distinction for me is do they have

116
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:27,200
responsibilities? And if you're in college, you don't.

117
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:29,680
I mean, you probably don't. You might have some.

118
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:34,160
They may seem like responsibilities that you have, but you don't.

119
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:35,520
That's not accurate.

120
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:38,880
Are they sexually active? Middle schoolers.

121
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:43,440
By the time you reach middle school, this is, I saw Pew research study about this.

122
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:49,280
By the time that anyone ever reaches middle school, they're already hooking up.

123
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:53,440
They're already, you know, shagging and snogging.

124
00:07:55,680 --> 00:08:01,120
You can't look at a middle schooler that, you know, this Saturday night is going to

125
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:05,600
make sweet love to a woman or to a man and say, look at that kid.

126
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:08,480
Look at that sexually active kid. It's not right.

127
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:10,800
But he also doesn't have a job.

128
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:12,720
That doesn't matter.

129
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:13,920
It does to me.

130
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:15,280
Lots of adults don't have jobs.

131
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:17,600
And their kids.

132
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:20,080
You're saying that unemployed to a kid?

133
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:20,580
Yeah.

134
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:22,400
Oh, you got fired?

135
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:23,520
You're a kid again.

136
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:24,240
You're a kid now.

137
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:29,520
Listen, if it was that way, I would tender my resignation right now.

138
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:34,480
But if you have if you have no job, but you have a child, you become a young adult.

139
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:36,320
OK, I don't understand.

140
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:37,520
It's a weird sliding scale.

141
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:38,800
I have it written down somewhere.

142
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:42,960
Is there any gradient between the two or is it just hard stop?

143
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:43,680
You're a kid now.

144
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:48,400
Yeah. You mean if you become like a part time employee, then you're a teenager.

145
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:52,640
Griffith, Travis, you realize these are tied to ages, right?

146
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:55,520
I mean, you're you're we're having a lot of fun here so far.

147
00:08:56,880 --> 00:09:00,960
You realize these are our delineations for ages.

148
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:01,460
Yeah.

149
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:06,000
I did not.

150
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:06,500
OK.

151
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:09,360
But I'm also not ashamed.

152
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:12,000
Well, I guess that's I guess that's something.

153
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,680
Travis is a West Virginia heart.

154
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:15,040
He's living mountain proud.

155
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:17,040
He doesn't care about the role society makes for him.

156
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:17,840
He's a mountain proud.

157
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:20,720
Can we change the name of our podcast to Mountain Proud?

158
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:23,200
Don't call anyone a kid.

159
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:31,760
I think I think God, once you're like an irascible 70 year old who like only sits on their porch

160
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:36,080
exclusively, then you can start busting out that kind of vernacular.

161
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:39,680
You're 20 fucking five. No way.

162
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:42,560
Because realistically, like and I get it because I do the same thing.

163
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:47,840
But the reason that you want to do that is to feel superior is so that you can be like,

164
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:50,400
I've seen some shit and they are still kids.

165
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:51,360
And like, yeah, I get it.

166
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:55,600
But it's always going to kind of even people around you that want to do the same thing.

167
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:58,880
It's always going to make you seem a little bit judgy.

168
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:03,920
See, it's our fucking it's our stupid fucking language devoid of any and all honorifics.

169
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:07,040
That is what that is what Japanese has got on us.

170
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:14,240
Like they have a system, a regimented system in place for referring to people based on

171
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:18,880
their place compared to yours in like the social cast.

172
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:25,760
We don't have anything like that, because if so, like, you know, I would probably call you guys,

173
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:28,880
you know, misters Travis and Justin.

174
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:33,760
And you would call me like Lil Griffin or something like that.

175
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:35,680
Can we please get that started?

176
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:37,040
I think we probably could.

177
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:40,000
I have news for you, Caleb, why you should be careful.

178
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:40,800
I'm 32.

179
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:41,680
You're 25.

180
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:42,240
Guess what?

181
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:44,240
You're a kid to me.

182
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:45,360
You're 25 years old.

183
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:45,840
You're a kid.

184
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:47,360
You're a baby boy.

185
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:48,560
You're a sweet baby boy.

186
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:52,240
Travis is going to be 30 years old in November.

187
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:53,280
Oh, Jesus.

188
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:53,680
I know.

189
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:54,320
Can you imagine?

190
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:56,400
What do you think you're going to be to him?

191
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:57,600
I have a hint for you.

192
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:58,000
A kid.

193
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:01,360
This fucking podcast is not unless you be kidded.

194
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:01,920
Think about it.

195
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:05,360
This podcast is going to be like two and a half fucking men when Travis turns 30.

196
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:10,160
It's two adults and a young upstart, crazy religious son.

197
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:12,880
And introducing Lil Griffin.

198
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:15,760
He melted the heart of a nation.

199
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:18,000
I eat it all the potato chips.

200
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:21,200
I've never watched a single episode of that show.

201
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:23,600
Where's the potato chips?

202
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:24,640
I have a date.

203
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:25,760
I eat it all.

204
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:28,240
Have you seen my slingshot?

205
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:30,320
What?

206
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:37,120
I actually just found my I eat it all the potato chips t-shirt from when Lil Griffin

207
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:39,360
was still really big on TGIF.

208
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:42,160
It is a collector's item now.

209
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:43,840
So I'm going to try to hold on to it.

210
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:44,560
It's going to come back.

211
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:45,680
You know, they're getting the reunion.

212
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:47,360
They're doing it.

213
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:48,160
You guys want to Yahoo?

214
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:49,120
Yeah.

215
00:11:49,120 --> 00:12:00,240
Um, this Yahoo was, uh, this Yahoo was sent in by Julie Ken.

216
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:00,880
Thanks, Julie Ken.

217
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:08,160
It's by Yahoo Answers user Koolaidman who asks how to make my clothes smell clean.

218
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:12,880
I have gym tomorrow and I don't have time to wash them.

219
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:17,120
How would I make them smell clean or just smell good with spraying them with tag work?

220
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:18,240
Sorry, what's tag?

221
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:19,360
One more time.

222
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:20,960
Is that like the body spray?

223
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:22,000
Is that a body spray?

224
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,600
So there's three body sprays, right?

225
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:33,040
There's the, there's the Trinity of douche smells and there's ax, there's tag, um, which

226
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:36,640
is very much, it's, I believe it is also delivered in aerosol form.

227
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:40,320
And then there's bod, uh, which I don't know if you guys remember bod.

228
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:44,640
It was, it was a fully blown liquid form that came in a little Windex bottle.

229
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:45,120
Uh huh.

230
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:45,680
Uh huh.

231
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:47,360
Uh huh.

232
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:48,400
And you would spray that.

233
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:48,800
Oh yeah.

234
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:50,320
I want your bod.

235
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:51,120
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

236
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:55,120
A very successful eye campaign, very successful, uh, uh, perfume.

237
00:12:56,080 --> 00:13:00,960
Um, and you, yeah, you just spray that on your clothes or on your wiener and then you're

238
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:02,480
ready to go for the Eve.

239
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:04,880
What about Saber with four R's at the end?

240
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:09,360
Was that, am I misremembering that as a, as a pretty, a pretty popular one?

241
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:11,840
I think you're misremembering that as like an extant thing.

242
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:13,360
Saber.

243
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:21,280
Remember it was like, it was like Alpine Stink and Mountain Wafter and.

244
00:13:21,280 --> 00:13:21,520
Yeah.

245
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:24,080
Truck, truck bed gravel.

246
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:26,160
Cloud shaker.

247
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:28,400
Midtime Saturdays.

248
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:28,960
Yeah.

249
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:30,160
Bad time Saturdays.

250
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
Fucking casual cretins.

251
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:36,480
Uncle Dylan secret.

252
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:38,000
They had lots of different.

253
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:38,720
Uncented.

254
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:46,160
You just, you just mist yourself with a, a saline.

255
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:46,800
I'm dry.

256
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:47,920
Sort of saline solution.

257
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:48,880
I'm really dry.

258
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:52,880
Um, take that with you to the theme park.

259
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:54,000
Sure.

260
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,040
Treat yourself.

261
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:57,600
Treat yourself to a little spritz, spritz, little spray.

262
00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:05,120
How do you make clothes smell, um, in Ghostbusters, he says that if you leave a shirt in the sun

263
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:07,040
for an hour, it'll smell good.

264
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:09,280
Is that, is that a possibility?

265
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:12,800
I thought it was that he left it outside his window so that the wind would blow through

266
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:14,720
it and take all the stink particles away.

267
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:17,760
I'm not sure on the physics of stink.

268
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:19,920
No little, little bugs are attracted to it.

269
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:21,920
They'll come harvest your stink.

270
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:26,560
Take it back to their, um, um, you know, the drones will take your stink particles back

271
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:27,360
to the queen.

272
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:28,320
Build a stink nest.

273
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:31,040
It's just like the circle of life, I guess.

274
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:31,600
Beautiful.

275
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:32,400
Yeah.

276
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:35,440
I'm so glad that my stink is being put to a good purpose.

277
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:37,120
Would you rather just waste it?

278
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:40,160
Would you rather just like flush it down the washing machine, Justin?

279
00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:42,240
No, you're right.

280
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:43,760
I'm, I'm eco.

281
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:44,720
I'm green.

282
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:50,800
I use shopping bags at the shopper and, uh, I, I, uh, I'm into this.

283
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:51,920
I'm into stink harvesting.

284
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:56,720
I actually wash my clothes in the river, uh, with sharp, uh, jagged stones.

285
00:14:56,720 --> 00:15:02,720
Um, so that way all the stink forms into a reef, um, that can host marine life.

286
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:03,280
Yeah.

287
00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:05,600
You always have to fucking one-up me.

288
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:07,520
Well, I'm just saying, like, I'm trying to live a green life.

289
00:15:07,520 --> 00:15:08,000
I'm sick of it.

290
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:08,560
I'm sick of it.

291
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:09,360
I don't take baths anymore.

292
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:09,920
I'm sick of it.

293
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:10,960
I feed my clothes.

294
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:11,840
Do I use deodorant?

295
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:17,840
I feed my clothes to my kids and that's like a fun way of like reducing my footprint.

296
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:24,480
Um, because my kids die and then they don't, they don't like do anything and they don't

297
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:25,760
like consume anything anymore.

298
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:31,840
I, I actually send, uh, all my unwanted, uh, stinky clothes, uh, to, uh, starving children

299
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:33,360
in Africa.

300
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:38,880
Uh, so they can wear like my print at Hardy T's, um, some of my, like my Ginko jeans.

301
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:39,840
Oh, they love that shit.

302
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:40,320
They love it.

303
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:40,800
They love the bag.

304
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:45,200
Oh, that is a great, please tell me that you wore your Ed Hardy T and your Ginko jeans

305
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:49,920
together while you sprayed yourself with unscented bod and just like got ready to get

306
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:50,400
fucked.

307
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:53,600
When they see me, I want them to be like, ah, that dude is classy.

308
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:56,480
And I know that because his t-shirt says classy.

309
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:57,840
Travis isn't just a look.

310
00:15:57,840 --> 00:15:59,840
Travis isn't just a person.

311
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:01,520
Travis is an aesthetic.

312
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:01,840
Really?

313
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:02,080
Yeah.

314
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:03,360
You know what?

315
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:06,320
What I'm doing is I'm, I'm selling my brand.

316
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:06,960
You know what I mean?

317
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:08,320
Like it's not just me.

318
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:09,840
It's Travis trademark.

319
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:12,880
Travis's saggums.

320
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:18,080
And cause you're, um, I'm assuming your Ginko jeans were tent like.

321
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:21,600
They actually contain smaller pants.

322
00:16:23,280 --> 00:16:24,720
So I don't understand.

323
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:26,000
Are we talking about four pant legs?

324
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,360
You're only occupying two at a time.

325
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:29,120
Please don't say three like a dick joke.

326
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:31,920
No, no, I have two dicks.

327
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:32,160
Okay.

328
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:34,880
Uh, moving on.

329
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:39,360
I was raised super religious and was prohibited from most physical contact with other people.

330
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:42,480
If I had been caught even holding hands with a girl, I would have been expelled.

331
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:47,040
I've since gotten out of that environment, but now I don't know what the rules are in

332
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:48,160
the real world.

333
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:52,320
So far I've been avoiding touching people except for handshakes and goodbye hugs, but

334
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:57,600
touching is really important for flirting and it would be fun if I could be sure I wasn't

335
00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:00,560
committing some unforgivable social sin by doing it to be clear.

336
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:02,480
I'm not talking about kissing or sex.

337
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:04,000
Those have obvious rules.

338
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:07,120
I'm talking about the zone between greeting strangers and kissing.

339
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:11,680
When can I touch people without being a creepy jerk?

340
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:14,000
That's from touchless in Rhode Island.

341
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:16,880
Such a good question.

342
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:17,200
Yeah.

343
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:22,240
Except that like the zone between greeting strangers and kissing is like all of it.

344
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:25,280
It's like, it's like everything.

345
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:27,600
Everything's hard and dangerous.

346
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:28,880
It's the whole spectrum.

347
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:31,520
You're talking about like a billion different steps in between those two.

348
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:33,200
Do you want to hear the creepy actor answer?

349
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:35,440
I don't think I do.

350
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:37,440
I think you have a feeling you're going to say it out loud anyway.

351
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:38,240
I am.

352
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:43,280
One of the things that we learned in our acting movement kind of classes is that when you're

353
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:46,880
working with someone, you can feel their energy.

354
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:47,760
Fuck off.

355
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:53,360
Open holes where like people could like let you know where it's okay to touch them during

356
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:56,960
a scene based on where their energy opened up a vacuum.

357
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:05,840
For a long time, Travis would walk into a party and say, does everyone feel my dick energy?

358
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:08,400
I feel some really prominent energy.

359
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:09,520
If anyone wants to...

360
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:14,000
I actually, to be fair, called it pinergy, but go on.

361
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:21,200
I have created a hole in my chi and in my jinko jeans for you to experience my dick beams.

362
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:22,320
Bzzz.

363
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:22,880
Let me help.

364
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:23,760
Bzzz.

365
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:24,240
Gotcha.

366
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:24,960
We can set some-

367
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:25,840
Should I go?

368
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:29,520
We can set some pretty easy rules, okay?

369
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:30,240
Here's one.

370
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:32,960
Don't touch anyone's butt.

371
00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:34,080
Yep.

372
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:37,120
Don't touch anyone's butt ever.

373
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:38,160
I think if it's...

374
00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:43,280
If it is shielded by a bathing suit, of course not.

375
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:46,480
If it's shielded by...

376
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:47,440
I don't care if it's shielded by-

377
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:52,240
What appropriate amount of fabric is there that it is okay to socially touch someone's butt?

378
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:54,720
God.

379
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:56,640
You don't.

380
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:57,840
I'm sorry, you don't.

381
00:18:57,840 --> 00:18:59,200
Don't ever touch anyone's butt.

382
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:00,800
Man, woman, child, child.

383
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:03,120
I don't care if you're wearing six ski suits.

384
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:07,040
Yeah, I don't even care if you can't tell where their butt is.

385
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:12,080
Like you give them a butt sort of DMZ, right?

386
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:13,760
Do not touch that butt.

387
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:15,040
Do not touch any butts.

388
00:19:15,040 --> 00:19:18,480
If you're in a committed relationship, then you get an engagement ring

389
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:20,880
and then you ask if you can touch the butt.

390
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:22,000
Other than that, no butt touching.

391
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,920
Are we talking about in public or in private?

392
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:26,800
I'm talking about if you're not in a relationship with someone,

393
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:29,040
you should never touch their butt.

394
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:29,920
Yes.

395
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:31,280
Why are you even like-

396
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:33,600
This person doesn't know!

397
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:34,560
I'm helping.

398
00:19:34,560 --> 00:19:35,440
This is helpful.

399
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:39,600
I don't think it's helpful as much as it is like completely obvious.

400
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:40,720
Let's go for more of a gray area.

401
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:42,480
Don't put your finger in their butt either.

402
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:43,520
Like don't-

403
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:44,880
Don't come their ears.

404
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:47,120
Don't go inside them in any way.

405
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:48,480
In any way.

406
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:50,240
I'm trying to create a practical guide.

407
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:51,600
Don't enter any orifices.

408
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:52,320
That's great.

409
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:53,520
Don't touch their butt.

410
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:56,160
Your mouth probably shouldn't touch anything.

411
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:57,920
Like don't put your mouth on someone's neck.

412
00:19:57,920 --> 00:19:58,560
They hate it.

413
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:01,760
Okay, so let's go for more of a gray area

414
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:04,800
and less of like an evil like dark dark area.

415
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:06,640
Sorry, if you were this guy,

416
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:08,800
would you be more concerned about entering a gray area

417
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:11,200
or entering the evil dark area?

418
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:13,680
Just like you put your tongue in my butt and I'm a stranger.

419
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:15,200
Like I didn't- I didn't know.

420
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:16,640
I don't know what this is.

421
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:17,280
I know he's not-

422
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:18,400
I'm stuck!

423
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:19,280
I'm stuck!

424
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:22,720
I know he's not in Cedar, man.

425
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:25,120
Like I know he has some baseline.

426
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:26,400
I'm just trying to get the easy stuff-

427
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:27,600
Well, but like what about shoulder?

428
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:28,480
What about shoulder?

429
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:29,440
Okay.

430
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:30,960
When is it okay to touch someone's shoulder?

431
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:33,600
I think you could touch someone's shoulder for one fact-

432
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:35,280
One Mississippi, done.

433
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:36,000
Out.

434
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,360
Longer than one Mississippi

435
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:38,480
and I think that you've-

436
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:40,160
Unless you're posing for a picture.

437
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:41,600
Like I think that that's-

438
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:43,920
I think also like there's a big difference between

439
00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:45,680
touching someone's shoulder like in greeting.

440
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:46,320
Like, hey!

441
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:48,160
And you kind of like smack their back,

442
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:48,960
you know, kind of thing.

443
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:50,480
Or like give them like a side hug.

444
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:51,040
Don't hurt them.

445
00:20:51,040 --> 00:20:52,400
Versus like you're sitting there talking to them

446
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:53,760
and suddenly you just reach out

447
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:55,200
and rest your hand on their shoulder.

448
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,720
That- that should be saved for serious conversations.

449
00:20:58,720 --> 00:20:58,960
Yes.

450
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:02,560
I think that what if-

451
00:21:02,560 --> 00:21:03,360
What if we had-

452
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:06,080
What if we invented some kind of social sex dice?

453
00:21:07,040 --> 00:21:08,960
And then whenever you greeted a stranger,

454
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:10,160
you would each roll a dice

455
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:12,880
and it would tell you a body part to touch with their body part.

456
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:14,400
But it wouldn't be anything perverse.

457
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:16,480
It would just be like hand to like cheek.

458
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:18,400
Oh, so it's just like completely innocuous

459
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:19,840
like elbow to elbow.

460
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:21,920
Yep, to knock your knees together.

461
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:24,320
And then you would just like do a-

462
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:25,520
Oh, you know what would be good?

463
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:28,960
What if there was some sort of codified way of greeting somebody

464
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:30,640
where you just like grabbed their hand

465
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:31,600
and then grabbed your hand?

466
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:33,440
Like what are we fucking talking about?

467
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:35,440
He already covered handshakes.

468
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:38,080
That- that part he's good with.

469
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:41,360
He's trying to close the bridge between handshakes and kissing

470
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:44,000
and I'm trying to shine the light of truth

471
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,640
on some of the pitfalls that he's got to avoid.

472
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:46,960
All right.

473
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:47,600
Flirty fun.

474
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:48,480
Flirty fun.

475
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:49,120
That's our new-

476
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:50,000
That's the new motto.

477
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:50,640
Flirty fun.

478
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:52,080
Keep it fun.

479
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:52,880
Keep it flirty.

480
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:53,840
Keep it not weird.

481
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:56,240
That's like nothing.

482
00:21:57,040 --> 00:21:58,480
There's nothing you can do.

483
00:21:58,480 --> 00:21:59,680
This is the great-

484
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:00,000
There's-

485
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,960
It's a mystery how anyone gets born.

486
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:04,000
No, you know what you do?

487
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:04,480
You gotta-

488
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:07,920
You gotta take the- the shit that you already know.

489
00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:12,640
You gotta take your- your areas in which you are confident and competent

490
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:13,920
and you need to put a little-

491
00:22:13,920 --> 00:22:15,280
You gotta chop it and screw it.

492
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:16,480
You gotta remix it a little bit.

493
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:19,360
So like go in for that hug when you say goodbye to somebody you like.

494
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:22,800
Maybe hold it in for like second and a half too long

495
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:25,040
or like really get your chin down in that neck.

496
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:28,320
People are gonna either like that or not like that and then you know.

497
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:30,160
Or maybe when your hand-

498
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:31,920
Maybe when you're shaking their hand,

499
00:22:31,920 --> 00:22:33,840
you hold it for like a long time

500
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:35,360
and then you take your other hand on the-

501
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:38,000
You take your index finger and you make little circles

502
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,520
on the back of their hand while you're holding it.

503
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:42,480
It's just like fun flirty stuff you can do.

504
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:44,800
Griffin's suggesting a very-

505
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:48,800
A very Dian Fossey sort of gorillas in the mist approach

506
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:52,720
to learning social interaction where just you physically do it

507
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:54,320
and see if you get bitten.

508
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:55,440
And then take notes.

509
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:58,880
And then move to a different town once you've established your thing.

510
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:00,000
That's another important thing.

511
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:03,040
After every physical interaction,

512
00:23:03,040 --> 00:23:05,280
copious notes in front of the person.

513
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:07,120
They need to see you're engaged.

514
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:11,280
And if you could do it like on a live blog kind of setup

515
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:14,400
so that other people can learn from your experiences.

516
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:16,960
Oh definitely, definitely want to know what happens here.

517
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:18,880
Definitely want some follow-up info.

518
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:20,240
And maybe some GIFs.

519
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:21,920
Maybe a couple GIF GIFs.

520
00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:25,120
Maybe the answer here is just to never be

521
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:28,400
sort of the hugresser if you will.

522
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:32,560
And make it clear the sort of social physical contact

523
00:23:32,560 --> 00:23:34,320
that you're in the market for.

524
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:39,680
Sort of put your sign out and let that person take the lead.

525
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:41,600
I mean because here's the thing realistically,

526
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:43,520
like as I've been sitting here trying to think about it,

527
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:46,400
it's one of those things that as soon as you are thinking about it,

528
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:49,280
there is nothing you can do that's not creepy.

529
00:23:49,280 --> 00:23:49,840
You know what I mean?

530
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:51,760
Because the thing is,

531
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:55,520
as soon as it's not like just a spontaneous action that you've taken,

532
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:56,480
when you think about it like,

533
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:58,320
can I touch their shoulder right now?

534
00:23:58,320 --> 00:23:59,440
It's already creepy.

535
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:00,800
You're inherently thinking about something

536
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:02,880
that you would be ashamed to say out loud.

537
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:04,720
Like you would never say out loud to someone,

538
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:06,720
I've been thinking about how to touch you.

539
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,720
Because that dog will not hunt.

540
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:12,640
So I would say like the best thing to do

541
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:14,640
is just try to quiet your mind

542
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:17,680
and just like hang out with the person and not worry about it.

543
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:22,080
And then if you know in the course of the conversation,

544
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:24,640
like you end up like kind of you know touching their arm or whatever,

545
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:25,360
so be it.

546
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:28,880
But if you try to think about it while you're doing it,

547
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:31,840
one, you're probably not paying attention to them

548
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:34,320
and not really listening and being a good friend

549
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:36,080
or flirting efficiently.

550
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:38,240
And secondly, as you're thinking about it,

551
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:42,240
you're ruining the moment by forcing it.

552
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:43,680
Yeah, but if you don't think,

553
00:24:43,680 --> 00:24:46,720
I mean, yes, but if you just go out,

554
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:48,960
that's what being drunk is for,

555
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:50,880
to do these sorts of things without consideration.

556
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:52,080
Oh, was that not clear?

557
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:54,080
You need to be drunk 24 stuff.

558
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:57,440
Yeah, there's nothing that people like around more than a touchy drunk guy.

559
00:24:57,440 --> 00:25:01,280
That's never gotten anyone into trouble.

560
00:25:01,280 --> 00:25:03,920
Everybody else also has to be as drunk if not more.

561
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:05,440
Did we all touch?

562
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:09,040
I was just gonna make a joke about how you can sing ZZ Top's

563
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:11,120
I'm just looking for some touch to people,

564
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:13,040
but the name of that song is actually tush.

565
00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:16,800
Like they're singing like I'm just looking for some tush.

566
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:20,560
How the fuck have we allowed ZZ Top to get away with that shit

567
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:21,920
since the summer of 75?

568
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:23,920
What the like, what the fuck have we-

569
00:25:23,920 --> 00:25:26,080
They have a song called like tube snake boogie.

570
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:27,040
Right.

571
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:28,240
How about wieners?

572
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:30,320
That song called she wants a pearl necklace.

573
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:31,040
But that's fun.

574
00:25:31,040 --> 00:25:33,840
But that's like fun, like a fun double entendre.

575
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:35,440
They're literally saying like,

576
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:38,240
I'm just trying to hunt some fanny cheeks.

577
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:43,360
Like ZZ Top, I just wanna squeeze a titty.

578
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:47,040
Like ZZ Top, you can't just come out and say the thing that you wanna do.

579
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:54,880
I would like to ejaculate thanks to a sexual partner's interaction with my genitals.

580
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:57,520
ZZ Top.

581
00:25:57,520 --> 00:25:58,640
Mr. Top, please stop.

582
00:25:59,280 --> 00:26:02,160
The joke, the persistent joke of ZZ Top

583
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:04,320
is that anyone could ever love a bearded man.

584
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:11,360
This is the great underlying satirical tone in their music,

585
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:14,640
which you miss if you aren't paying close enough attention.

586
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:15,040
Also-

587
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:16,800
The word, according to the Wikipedia article,

588
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:19,760
the word tush is pronounced in the song in such a way

589
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:21,200
that it rhymes with the word rush,

590
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:25,040
resulting in a mond green, which has some listeners believing the word is touch

591
00:26:25,040 --> 00:26:26,080
if they haven't read the lyrics.

592
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:28,320
That's because they fucking like said the word wrong.

593
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:29,680
You're not allowed to do that either.

594
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:33,920
You're not allowed to do that either.

595
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:37,520
Say what you will, I love Munduck Dynasty.

596
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:39,840
Some episodes of that show are really tushing.

597
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:40,880
What are you fucking doing?

598
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:41,380
Yeah.

599
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:44,320
Here's a Yahoo answer.

600
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:46,000
Here's a Yahoo mystery, Knights.

601
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:49,840
Yahoo mystery, Knights.

602
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:51,840
It was sent to me by Jacob Holt.

603
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:52,400
Thanks, Jacob.

604
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:55,680
It's by Yahoo mystery user Mondo10, who asks,

605
00:26:57,520 --> 00:27:01,920
would it look cocky or vulgar if I posted a transformation pic on Facebook?

606
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:06,400
Like, I was about to upload my before and after pic

607
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:10,960
of how I was fat starting sophomore and how I look now with a six pack

608
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:12,160
and completely shredded.

609
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:14,480
When people hate or think I'm cocky,

610
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:16,560
it's not like I'm doing a selfie of my body.

611
00:27:16,560 --> 00:27:18,240
It's putting both in one pic.

612
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:20,160
You're doing a double selfie.

613
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:25,360
Right, but if he was totally ripped and shredded in both pics,

614
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:26,480
then I think it would be a selfie.

615
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:29,520
I think this is like an admission of-

616
00:27:30,160 --> 00:27:31,280
Let me throw this out.

617
00:27:31,280 --> 00:27:34,880
This is the only circumstance in which I would allow this.

618
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:38,080
Picture one, ripped, shredded, lifting up,

619
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:40,960
your wife beat her to show your abs, posing.

620
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:44,720
Picture two, exact same picture, but you took it a month later

621
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:45,840
after you're growing a mustache.

622
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:48,560
And you have a seventh, you have a seventh pack.

623
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:51,360
And it's like one of those like magic eye,

624
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:54,240
like find the differences and the difference is the mustache

625
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:57,440
and the seventh app that's migrated up towards your right breast.

626
00:27:57,440 --> 00:27:59,280
Right, and if you look really, really,

627
00:27:59,280 --> 00:28:01,440
if you put your face really close into those abs

628
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:04,160
and you pull back just a little bit, oh, it's a sailboat.

629
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:07,760
There's a sailboat in there.

630
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:08,320
That's fun.

631
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:14,880
I think that you should have one picture of yourself completely fat,

632
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:16,240
totally fat.

633
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:17,680
You probably have one of those.

634
00:28:17,680 --> 00:28:20,800
And then the second picture, you're shredded, right?

635
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:24,960
Six pack the whole bit, except you're surrounded by Nazi paraphernalia.

636
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:32,000
People are forced to confront the nature of transformation

637
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,640
and the steep price we must sometimes pay.

638
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:36,880
You take the good, you take the bad, you take them both.

639
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:41,120
And this is a third panel that just says worth it, question mark.

640
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:42,640
Maybe, it's up to you, listener.

641
00:28:43,280 --> 00:28:46,560
I miss fat, non-antisemitic Joe.

642
00:28:46,560 --> 00:28:47,920
Okay, what about first picture?

643
00:28:47,920 --> 00:28:49,840
You're fat, but you're very happy.

644
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:51,120
Second picture, you're ripped,

645
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:53,520
but they can see that there's trouble behind your eyes.

646
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:56,880
Then a third panel where you're fat again and clearly happy again.

647
00:28:56,880 --> 00:28:57,200
Okay.

648
00:28:57,840 --> 00:28:59,520
You've just come back around, but you know what?

649
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:00,400
I wasn't happy.

650
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:02,240
I wasn't, it's like limitless.

651
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:04,320
No, it's like fucking shallow hell.

652
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:05,600
If you're going to compare it to a film.

653
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:06,800
It's like shallow limitless.

654
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:11,680
I think the fat to like shred it up to like,

655
00:29:11,680 --> 00:29:14,320
then a third panel where you're just kind of somewhere in the middle.

656
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:16,480
And that's sort of a realistic take on weight loss.

657
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:18,080
It's like, oh man, I fucking slipped up.

658
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:20,160
I need to eat and healthy sucked.

659
00:29:20,160 --> 00:29:23,440
So I might as well just try and like balance out until I die.

660
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:25,600
You know, but they don't do that with other things.

661
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:28,400
There's not like one where the dudes are just sitting in pajama pants at home

662
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:31,280
watching SpongeBob SquarePants at like three o'clock in the afternoon.

663
00:29:31,280 --> 00:29:33,680
And then the second panel where the guy sitting in a cubicle,

664
00:29:33,680 --> 00:29:35,760
like talking on the phone, giving a big thumbs up.

665
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:36,800
I don't understand.

666
00:29:36,800 --> 00:29:39,120
Like, oh, you're talking about being unemployed and employed.

667
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:42,160
Like there's not before and after for any other life situation.

668
00:29:42,160 --> 00:29:43,600
Between being a kid and an adult, you mean?

669
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:45,600
Yes. Thank you.

670
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:48,560
But like that idea of saying like, this was me fat and this is me fit.

671
00:29:48,560 --> 00:29:52,480
Like there's no like, this was me living in an apartment.

672
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:53,600
This is me living in a house.

673
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:56,000
This is me before I learned C plus programming.

674
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:56,400
Yeah.

675
00:29:56,400 --> 00:29:57,520
And this is me after I learned it.

676
00:29:57,520 --> 00:29:58,080
Can you tell?

677
00:29:58,880 --> 00:29:59,380
Right.

678
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:01,200
I programmed this Facebook.

679
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:01,760
I don't understand.

680
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:02,880
I don't understand the obsession.

681
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:05,600
I used to not be able to cook quinoa.

682
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:06,480
Now I totally do.

683
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:07,520
And I eat it all the time.

684
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:11,920
Can you tell before and after you look so much happier in the second picture?

685
00:30:11,920 --> 00:30:12,960
Yeah, it's the quinoa.

686
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:17,760
I told you I learned it's an ancient, it's an ancient grain, super food.

687
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:20,320
It's a super food and an ancient grain.

688
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:22,480
This is me pre-goji.

689
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:23,440
This is me after goji.

690
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:28,080
You can tell because I'm fucking, I have a 13 pack and I'm fucking glowing.

691
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:33,360
And I'm floating six inches off.

692
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:34,800
I'm floating six inches off the ground.

693
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:38,320
I'm shooting beams of energy out of my, out of my chi holes.

694
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:41,360
I went super Saiyan.

695
00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:42,160
There, it's out.

696
00:30:42,160 --> 00:30:44,960
I went super Saiyan thanks to my goji and my ancient grains.

697
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:49,680
If we want to buy more goji and ancient grains, we got to get some money.

698
00:30:49,680 --> 00:31:03,520
So let's do that now.

699
00:31:03,520 --> 00:31:07,600
We talk a lot about sex toys on this program week to week.

700
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:07,920
We do?

701
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:09,440
I know.

702
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:11,200
Thanks to our friends, extremistraints.com.

703
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:13,200
But I want to, I want to change it up.

704
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:19,360
I feel like we give so much coverage to extremistraints.com's sex toys that we miss

705
00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:21,520
all the other great options.

706
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:23,920
I get all my groceries off extremistraints.

707
00:31:25,520 --> 00:31:27,280
The Claiming of Sleeping Beauty.

708
00:31:27,280 --> 00:31:28,160
That's a book.

709
00:31:28,160 --> 00:31:29,200
You could just buy that.

710
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:30,880
It's by Anne Rice.

711
00:31:31,920 --> 00:31:37,600
It's a very, it's a book about the creator of Sleeping Beauty who is very litigious.

712
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:43,760
And there were a lot of people who wrote basically Sleeping Beauty knockoffs.

713
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:47,120
And so this writer had to like defend her intellectual property.

714
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:48,480
It's very fascinating stuff.

715
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:49,280
Very interesting.

716
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:51,520
It's probably not about that at all.

717
00:31:51,520 --> 00:31:58,080
There's also a book you can pick up called Bondage for Sex, which is a great, I'm glad

718
00:31:58,080 --> 00:32:05,440
they're differentiating from, I don't know, bondage for tax evasion.

719
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:08,240
I don't know the other reasons for bondage.

720
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:10,960
Pipe sealant, I'm guessing.

721
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:11,440
I guess.

722
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:14,720
Bondage for own protection.

723
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:17,040
Bondage for your own safety.

724
00:32:17,040 --> 00:32:17,520
Your werewolf.

725
00:32:17,520 --> 00:32:18,240
For werewolves.

726
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:19,280
Yeah, exactly.

727
00:32:20,160 --> 00:32:23,440
Or maybe like you just can't control yourself around chocolate chip cookies, you know?

728
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:25,200
Like if you put me in front of them, I'm going to eat them.

729
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:27,200
So I'm going to need you to strap into this bed.

730
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:27,840
Hold me back.

731
00:32:28,800 --> 00:32:29,600
There's a paddle.

732
00:32:30,160 --> 00:32:32,160
That's great for strict parents.

733
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:34,160
Or for getting pizzas out of the oven.

734
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:38,800
That is if you want the bottom of your child or the bottom of your pizza to say

735
00:32:38,800 --> 00:32:40,000
slut on it backwards.

736
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:46,400
Will you make, you make this amazing artichoke slut pizza?

737
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:48,720
Uh, can you, can we have that for dinner tonight?

738
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:51,680
Can we have slut pizza for dinner tonight?

739
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:53,440
Absolutely.

740
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:55,680
That's all, that's the only thing on my menu.

741
00:32:56,640 --> 00:32:58,400
And I mean, of course there's nipple clamps.

742
00:32:58,400 --> 00:33:03,120
There's so much extreme restraints.com chastity devices, which are like the opposite of sex

743
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:04,000
toys.

744
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:04,640
Think about it.

745
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:06,720
And so much more.

746
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:11,360
The good news is you can get it all 20% off by using the coupon code sexabunga.

00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:15,920
You didn't like, you just said it again.

749
00:33:15,920 --> 00:33:16,480
You didn't spell.

750
00:33:17,280 --> 00:33:18,240
One more time.

751
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:19,360

00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:21,440

00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:23,760
Spelled just like it sounds.

00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:25,040
Spelled just like it sounds.

755
00:33:25,040 --> 00:33:27,200
All capitalized and with three exclamation points.

756
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:28,080
And unsettling.

757
00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:31,840

00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:33,840
Go get 20% off right now.

759
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:41,040
I have a message for Blaine from Mary who says in just a few days we will be married.

760
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:45,680
I can't properly express how excited I am to spend the rest of my life with you.

761
00:33:45,680 --> 00:33:49,760
I look forward to years of cats, video games, and traveling all over the world.

762
00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:54,240
I love everything about you and hope that someday we can finally own a horse together.

763
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:55,520
I did not misspell house.

764
00:33:57,280 --> 00:33:59,360
I'm sure this comes as quite the surprise to Blaine.

765
00:34:00,560 --> 00:34:03,520
A horse is like the best shelter I think you can have.

766
00:34:03,520 --> 00:34:04,560
Like a tax shelter?

767
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:06,720
No, like a living place.

768
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:07,200
Oh, okay.

769
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:13,040
I would point out though that if you're hoping to travel the world, maybe having a pet horse

770
00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:16,880
isn't the way to go because you can't really like take them with you.

771
00:34:18,080 --> 00:34:19,680
And God knows you'll want to.

772
00:34:19,680 --> 00:34:20,960
Like you're not going to want to leave them.

773
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:22,000
That's the problem.

774
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:24,000
All your plans for, you know, you can make all these plans.

775
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,160
We're going to be different from all the other horse owners.

776
00:34:26,160 --> 00:34:27,760
We're going to be cool, you know.

777
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:31,440
But once you have the horse, everything changes.

778
00:34:32,720 --> 00:34:34,320
You're going to want to stay home more.

779
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:38,320
You know, maybe another night watching Project Runway reruns.

780
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:43,360
Not so bad because you get to do it together as a family with your horse.

781
00:34:43,360 --> 00:34:47,200
I've been looking into this two-bedroom, two-bath horse here in Austin.

782
00:34:48,720 --> 00:34:49,680
I can get it for a song.

783
00:34:49,680 --> 00:34:52,080
It's really competitive, the horsey market.

784
00:34:53,040 --> 00:35:01,280
I got a message for Alexandra Splendor from Alexandra Splendor and she says,

785
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:05,120
hey brothers, it's my 20th birthday on the 21st.

786
00:35:05,120 --> 00:35:09,040
I want to treat myself to a special birthday message from my favorite trio.

787
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:11,680
My friend Amber introduced me to your show via Corncob Boy

788
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:12,960
and I've been obsessed ever since.

789
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:15,520
Your show has helped me get through life with a smile.

790
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:18,480
Danny Glover, you all.

791
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:21,920
P.S. Can Griffin say sugar water?

792
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:28,320
Man, we had a fucking exterminator come to our house

793
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:30,560
because we have a very serious ant problem.

794
00:35:30,560 --> 00:35:36,000
Um, and my cat, like, went ape shit on him.

795
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:39,040
Like, I've never seen my cat, like, freak the fuck out before.

796
00:35:39,600 --> 00:35:41,200
And when I told Rachel, she was like,

797
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:43,840
is it possible that he was a bunch of bugs in a suit?

798
00:35:45,840 --> 00:35:47,440
Like, the cockroach guy from Men in Black.

799
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:52,240
If he's a bunch of bugs in a suit, being an exterminator seems a cruel twist of fate.

800
00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:57,120
Maybe, or else he's just, like, false flagging it and just spraying water.

801
00:35:57,120 --> 00:35:58,160
Or sugar water.

802
00:35:58,160 --> 00:36:00,720
Sugar is spraying over the water all around my house.

803
00:36:02,720 --> 00:36:05,840
You shouldn't have any more problems with ants.

804
00:36:07,840 --> 00:36:11,440
We've sprayed it with a deadly toxin.

805
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:12,480
You sound like Torgo.

806
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:17,520
The only way to check it is to leave apples on the counter.

807
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:22,000
A dish of jelly?

808
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:25,120
Well, that seems perfect.

809
00:36:25,120 --> 00:36:28,160
Uh, we have one more message.

810
00:36:28,160 --> 00:36:31,120
It's for Alicia Neal, uh, from Justin Gray.

811
00:36:31,120 --> 00:36:32,000
Happy birthday.

812
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:34,080
Happy 30th birthday to Alicia Neal.

813
00:36:34,080 --> 00:36:39,680
Wonderful painter, beloved by corgis, never-ending story, and M-B-M-B-A-M devotee.

814
00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:44,880
An all-around swell lady from her demo partner in crime and co-liver in sin, Justin.

815
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:51,120
May this year bring you the fanciest of cocktails, macaroons, adventures, and parties.

816
00:36:51,120 --> 00:36:53,280
I feel like I know everything about this lady now.

817
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:55,360
Yeah, I have a window into her soul.

818
00:36:55,360 --> 00:36:57,520
I like that we're on par with never-ending story.

819
00:36:58,560 --> 00:36:59,680
I wouldn't say that.

820
00:36:59,680 --> 00:37:00,960
It's heavy praise.

821
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:02,800
But she's devoted to us both.

822
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:04,480
She is a servant of two masters.

823
00:37:05,120 --> 00:37:07,040
I don't think we could call ourselves her master.

824
00:37:07,040 --> 00:37:07,920
That's terrible.

825
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:09,040
Now we're her master.

826
00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:10,160
You can't get the fold, Alicia.

827
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:12,480
Please put on this robe.

828
00:37:13,360 --> 00:37:15,200
Uh, this robe smells terrible.

829
00:37:17,840 --> 00:37:19,360
Didn't you have this thing harvested?

830
00:37:20,560 --> 00:37:22,240
I forgot to put it outside the window.

831
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:23,280
I'm so sorry.

832
00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:24,560
New question.

833
00:37:24,560 --> 00:37:29,440
I'm on a semester abroad in France, and there's some really cool girls here that I've met both

834
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:31,200
English-speaking and not.

835
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:35,200
I'd really like to take one out to dinner to get to know her better, but apparently in

836
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:39,120
Europe, that is much too serious and reserved for actual couples.

837
00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:44,000
I feel like anything less than a date just puts me in the friend zone.

838
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:48,320
How do I show interest in a girl without taking her on a date?

839
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:52,720
That's from really confused in, I don't know, some French city, I think.

840
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:54,320
I can't pronounce it.

841
00:37:55,360 --> 00:37:57,120
Some fur in place.

842
00:37:57,120 --> 00:37:58,480
Some fur in place.

843
00:37:58,480 --> 00:38:00,080
First off, friend zone is illusion.

844
00:38:00,640 --> 00:38:00,960
Yep.

845
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:01,680
That doesn't exist.

846
00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:02,400
That doesn't exist.

847
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:04,880
Second off, they're women, not girls.

848
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:08,320
I guess just get all the classics out of the way.

849
00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:10,400
Now, let me get a country.

850
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:12,880
It's a commonwealth.

851
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:16,240
It is a union of nation-states.

852
00:38:16,240 --> 00:38:18,800
Let me get to the real meat of this question.

853
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:27,360
What exactly about the last three and a half years we've all spent together have you said,

854
00:38:27,360 --> 00:38:35,200
boy, these guys have such a good handle on how relationships work in America, I bet that

855
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:38,000
they're just experts about all around the globe.

856
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:39,200
Do you really think that-

857
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:41,440
They seem like intercontinental.

858
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:44,160
They seem like intercontinental classy gentlemen.

859
00:38:44,160 --> 00:38:49,600
Do you think we got so smart about relationships in America that we've branched out to challenge

860
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:50,160
ourselves?

861
00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:51,920
We don't know where to put hands.

862
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:54,640
The only thing we could tell a guy is not to touch people's butts.

863
00:38:54,640 --> 00:38:56,480
That's where we're at, caveman status.

864
00:38:57,280 --> 00:39:03,600
Is it possible that it is simply, and I know you said English-speaking and non-English-speaking,

865
00:39:03,600 --> 00:39:09,680
but is it possible that it's just different connotations to hear when you say go on a

866
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:13,840
date, it just means you're going one-on-one with the person to go do something?

867
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:19,440
Maybe there, when you say go on a date, it just carries a different kind of weight?

868
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:20,800
Because what difference is there?

869
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:26,080
If you just said, hey, do you want to go hang out and see a movie, how is that different?

870
00:39:26,080 --> 00:39:28,160
Travis, I don't know.

871
00:39:28,160 --> 00:39:30,560
It's another goddamn country.

872
00:39:31,360 --> 00:39:31,760
I don't know.

873
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:35,760
Because it seems to me like the question this person's asking is, hey, they don't want to

874
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:36,560
call it a date.

875
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:38,400
How do I still get to know him?

876
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:41,840
By just hanging out?

877
00:39:41,840 --> 00:39:46,000
Just being around them and then listening to them talk and then interpreting the things

878
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:49,120
they say and then storing that data in your brain?

879
00:39:49,120 --> 00:39:50,960
Without having to label it like an American?

880
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:52,320
That's the problem.

881
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:54,080
That's the issue.

882
00:39:54,080 --> 00:39:57,040
You got to think a little bit more European.

883
00:39:57,760 --> 00:40:00,720
Travis, you're going to Europe in a couple months.

884
00:40:00,720 --> 00:40:03,680
How have you started to recalibrate your thought patterns?

885
00:40:03,680 --> 00:40:04,880
Well, I got a passport.

886
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:05,760
Sure, that's key.

887
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:09,280
I'm driving on the other side of the road.

888
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:11,120
Does this person have a passport?

889
00:40:11,120 --> 00:40:12,240
Do you have a passport?

890
00:40:12,240 --> 00:40:13,360
Have you checked their passport?

891
00:40:13,360 --> 00:40:15,040
That'd be a good way to learn some stuff about them.

892
00:40:15,040 --> 00:40:18,960
Let's see what passports are for them.

893
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:20,880
Let's pack each other's bags for travel.

894
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:21,920
Let me see all your visas.

895
00:40:24,560 --> 00:40:26,320
Can I check your receipts for travel?

896
00:40:26,320 --> 00:40:27,840
Do you have anything to declare?

897
00:40:27,840 --> 00:40:29,600
Have you brought any fruits and vegetables?

898
00:40:29,600 --> 00:40:30,160
Do you have any?

899
00:40:30,160 --> 00:40:31,600
Hey, just a quick question.

900
00:40:31,600 --> 00:40:33,280
Just to just quick get to know you.

901
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:36,240
Have you got any foreign soils?

902
00:40:36,240 --> 00:40:38,640
Got any jars of foreign soils that you're sneaking in?

903
00:40:38,640 --> 00:40:42,560
I was wondering about your youth,

904
00:40:42,560 --> 00:40:46,160
and specifically your youth within the last three weeks,

905
00:40:46,160 --> 00:40:47,760
and have you interacted with any livestock?

906
00:40:50,240 --> 00:40:54,160
The Brothers McElroy told me that this is a social faux pas,

907
00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:56,800
but I'm going to have to stick my finger in your butthole

908
00:40:56,800 --> 00:40:59,280
just to make sure you don't got any foreign soils in there.

909
00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:01,520
Or livestock.

910
00:41:01,520 --> 00:41:02,480
I have a bit of a problem.

911
00:41:02,480 --> 00:41:02,800
Don't do it.

912
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:04,160
Why are you trying to start a relationship

913
00:41:04,160 --> 00:41:06,320
that you know when the semester is over

914
00:41:06,320 --> 00:41:07,600
is just going to end in heartbreak?

915
00:41:07,600 --> 00:41:10,080
Didn't you see fucking Before Sunrise?

916
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:12,480
Or After Sunset?

917
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:14,800
Or After Sunset?

918
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:16,720
Or From Dawn Till Dawn?

919
00:41:16,720 --> 00:41:17,440
1230.

920
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:20,400
They had a movie called 1230.

921
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:21,440
It was a minute long.

922
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:22,480
They were at Hardee's,

923
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:26,080
and they were drinking a triple thick milkshake.

924
00:41:26,080 --> 00:41:27,760
And at the very end of the movie, she's like,

925
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:30,240
why are we eating it hot?

926
00:41:30,240 --> 00:41:33,280
And then credits.

927
00:41:33,280 --> 00:41:34,160
Haunting stuff.

928
00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:36,000
It is not Linklater's best work.

929
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:38,240
In fact, I'll go out on a limb and call it his worst work.

930
00:41:40,640 --> 00:41:42,080
You know, that was the last movie Roger D.

931
00:41:42,080 --> 00:41:42,960
would ever saw.

932
00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:44,400
His quote upon leaving the theater was,

933
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:45,200
oh man.

934
00:41:45,200 --> 00:41:45,760
Stop it.

935
00:41:46,640 --> 00:41:47,280
Not like this.

936
00:41:47,840 --> 00:41:48,400
Not like this.

937
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:49,280
You guys want Yahoo?

938
00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:50,080
Not now.

939
00:41:50,080 --> 00:41:50,800
You guys want Yahoo!

940
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:51,680
Night's Mystery?

941
00:41:51,680 --> 00:41:52,880
Yeah, please.

942
00:41:52,880 --> 00:41:53,440
This Yahoo!

943
00:41:53,440 --> 00:41:55,200
Night's Mystery was sent in by Nathan Hull.

944
00:41:55,200 --> 00:41:55,840
Thanks, Nathan.

945
00:41:55,840 --> 00:41:56,400
It's by Yahoo!

946
00:41:56,400 --> 00:41:58,080
Answers user Cassie, who asks,

947
00:41:58,080 --> 00:41:59,920
simple cosplay ideas for me.

948
00:42:00,880 --> 00:42:03,520
I really want to do a cosplay for crazy day at school,

949
00:42:04,320 --> 00:42:06,560
but I don't have any money to buy and thing.

950
00:42:08,080 --> 00:42:11,520
So is there a cosplay I can make with normal cloths,

951
00:42:11,520 --> 00:42:13,360
but still have it look cool?

952
00:42:13,360 --> 00:42:14,880
I have wavy shoulder length,

953
00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:16,160
blonde hair and blue eyes.

954
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:18,500
Wait.

955
00:42:20,560 --> 00:42:21,760
So she's asking,

956
00:42:22,720 --> 00:42:25,600
is there a cosplay I can do without dressing up?

957
00:42:25,600 --> 00:42:27,120
No, no, no.

958
00:42:27,120 --> 00:42:30,160
She has normal cloths, not a big budget.

959
00:42:31,200 --> 00:42:32,000
She needs a lot of bang.

960
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:34,080
And give me her look one more time.

961
00:42:34,080 --> 00:42:36,000
Shoulder length, blonde hair and blue eyes.

962
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:37,680
Wavy, wavy ass hair.

963
00:42:37,680 --> 00:42:39,760
Oh, well that's, wait.

964
00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:40,240
Is that Buffy?

965
00:42:40,240 --> 00:42:41,280
Could she do Buffy?

966
00:42:41,280 --> 00:42:43,360
No, I'm thinking more like a Carrie Bradshaw.

967
00:42:44,160 --> 00:42:45,680
You could go as Carrie Bradshaw.

968
00:42:45,680 --> 00:42:47,840
That's a pretty lazy answer.

969
00:42:47,840 --> 00:42:49,200
Expecting a little bit more from you.

970
00:42:50,160 --> 00:42:52,240
You could go as Carrie Bradshaw's evil twin.

971
00:42:52,880 --> 00:42:53,380
Bane.

972
00:42:53,380 --> 00:42:54,740
Carrie Bradshaw's evil twin.

973
00:42:55,380 --> 00:42:56,260
Barry Bradshaw.

974
00:42:56,980 --> 00:42:57,860
Barry Bradshaw.

975
00:42:58,820 --> 00:43:00,260
That sounds more like a football player.

976
00:43:00,980 --> 00:43:02,340
You could go as a football player.

977
00:43:05,380 --> 00:43:07,300
Maybe it's like a scary doctor.

978
00:43:09,540 --> 00:43:12,500
Are you just naming things that women can be?

979
00:43:12,500 --> 00:43:14,980
Like is that just our, here's a list of things.

980
00:43:14,980 --> 00:43:17,460
I was evolving more into like Halloween costumes.

981
00:43:18,260 --> 00:43:21,380
At least he went fairly progressive down that line.

982
00:43:21,940 --> 00:43:22,500
Yeah.

983
00:43:22,500 --> 00:43:23,380
Women can be doctors.

984
00:43:23,380 --> 00:43:24,660
Women can be football players.

985
00:43:25,300 --> 00:43:26,340
They can be ghosts.

986
00:43:26,340 --> 00:43:27,780
They can be, women can be ghosts.

987
00:43:31,060 --> 00:43:32,820
Hey, women can be mummies too, you know.

988
00:43:33,940 --> 00:43:35,700
Such a narrow-minded point of view.

989
00:43:36,260 --> 00:43:38,820
All mummies are women, otherwise they're duddies.

990
00:43:40,660 --> 00:43:41,780
That joke was a duddy.

991
00:43:45,060 --> 00:43:45,860
Like Duddy Rock?

992
00:43:45,860 --> 00:43:47,060
Like Sean Paul?

993
00:43:48,020 --> 00:43:49,300
I'm sorry, what?

994
00:43:49,300 --> 00:43:54,340
Take that, Duddy, Duddy, Sean Paul, Sean Paul.

995
00:43:55,220 --> 00:43:56,260
You could be Sean Paul.

996
00:43:56,260 --> 00:43:57,860
Could you cosplay as Sean Paul?

997
00:43:57,860 --> 00:43:59,220
No one knows what he looks like anyways.

998
00:43:59,220 --> 00:44:00,100
The man's a mystery.

999
00:44:00,980 --> 00:44:03,140
Sean Paul is constantly changing.

1000
00:44:03,140 --> 00:44:04,580
Sean Paul is anonymous.

1001
00:44:04,580 --> 00:44:05,700
Sean Paul is Guy Fawkes.

1002
00:44:07,780 --> 00:44:09,700
It's hard to hear him at his concerts through his mask.

1003
00:44:09,700 --> 00:44:15,540
Can you take the mask off, Sean Paul?

1004
00:44:22,260 --> 00:44:25,700
Another thing you didn't know about Sean Paul is he's not a person.

1005
00:44:25,700 --> 00:44:27,220
According to his Wikipedia page,

1006
00:44:28,020 --> 00:44:32,100
Duddy Rock is the second album by reggae dancehall toaster Sean Paul.

1007
00:44:32,740 --> 00:44:34,420
So he's been a toaster this whole time.

1008
00:44:36,980 --> 00:44:38,020
You didn't suspect that.

1009
00:44:38,020 --> 00:44:39,860
He certainly has good flow for a toaster.

1010
00:44:45,380 --> 00:44:46,900
Your toast is done.

1011
00:44:46,900 --> 00:44:47,940
It's brown on country.

1012
00:44:51,380 --> 00:44:53,300
Oh man, all these are so terrible.

1013
00:44:53,300 --> 00:44:57,220
Sorry, Sean Paul, but if you're unpopular for long enough, you get on the list.

1014
00:45:00,340 --> 00:45:05,700
Our fucking random list of people that we summoned from the grave,

1015
00:45:05,700 --> 00:45:10,180
like Dr. Frankenstein, to turn into comedy tubes for our podcast.

1016
00:45:11,380 --> 00:45:13,300
Should have had a hit, son.

1017
00:45:15,860 --> 00:45:18,740
I imagine him and Duffy just sharing a long embrace.

1018
00:45:18,740 --> 00:45:19,380
Like, it's okay.

1019
00:45:20,820 --> 00:45:23,780
Welcome to my brother, my brother and me, bullied anonymous.

1020
00:45:24,580 --> 00:45:25,780
Please, no names.

1021
00:45:26,580 --> 00:45:28,020
Just the names that they gave us.

1022
00:45:28,020 --> 00:45:30,740
Duffy, Squinto, Sean Paul the toaster.

1023
00:45:32,980 --> 00:45:33,540
Welcome.

1024
00:45:33,540 --> 00:45:37,380
Welcome. I haven't been mentioned on my brother, my brother and me in three months.

1025
00:45:38,980 --> 00:45:39,620
So proud of you.

1026
00:45:43,700 --> 00:45:44,740
That's the problem.

1027
00:45:44,740 --> 00:45:49,940
See, you have people like French Stewart who crawled their way back into relevance

1028
00:45:49,940 --> 00:45:53,140
by getting back onto TV and then we can't talk about him anymore.

1029
00:45:53,700 --> 00:45:54,260
No.

1030
00:45:54,260 --> 00:45:55,540
Apparently, oh, by the way, you fucked up.

1031
00:45:55,540 --> 00:45:56,980
Duffy is on Dallas, too.

1032
00:45:56,980 --> 00:45:58,420
So we're gonna have to scratch him off the list.

1033
00:45:58,420 --> 00:46:00,980
And he's also not on Dukes of Hazzard.

1034
00:46:00,980 --> 00:46:03,780
No, he's not?

1035
00:46:03,780 --> 00:46:04,180
No.

1036
00:46:04,180 --> 00:46:05,300
Patrick Duffy wasn't in Dukes of Hazzard.

1037
00:46:05,300 --> 00:46:05,940
It was Tom Wopat.

1038
00:46:07,220 --> 00:46:07,460
Wow.

1039
00:46:07,460 --> 00:46:09,700
It was Wopat and the dad from Smallville.

1040
00:46:09,700 --> 00:46:11,860
Well, I mean.

1041
00:46:13,220 --> 00:46:14,100
What? Say it.

1042
00:46:14,100 --> 00:46:14,900
You say potato.

1043
00:46:15,780 --> 00:46:16,740
You say Wopato.

1044
00:46:19,540 --> 00:46:20,580
How about another question?

1045
00:46:20,580 --> 00:46:22,820
Wow, you are 100% right, Travis.

1046
00:46:22,820 --> 00:46:24,740
He was not on the Dukes of Hazzard.

1047
00:46:25,860 --> 00:46:26,500
Yeah.

1048
00:46:26,500 --> 00:46:28,260
He absolutely was not.

1049
00:46:28,820 --> 00:46:29,300
It's okay.

1050
00:46:29,300 --> 00:46:31,460
We'll get it in the Corrections and Attractions episode.

1051
00:46:31,460 --> 00:46:32,980
I'll be like, that's what-

1052
00:46:32,980 --> 00:46:34,180
Episode 200.

1053
00:46:34,180 --> 00:46:37,220
Episode 200 is gonna be like things we fucked up through history.

1054
00:46:37,220 --> 00:46:37,460
And it's gonna be-

1055
00:46:37,460 --> 00:46:38,180
Four hours.

1056
00:46:38,180 --> 00:46:39,380
It's gonna be a very long one.

1057
00:46:43,940 --> 00:46:45,860
I have a bit of a problem involving two friends.

1058
00:46:45,860 --> 00:46:48,740
These friends of mine have been in a relationship for a good few months now.

1059
00:46:48,740 --> 00:46:52,260
However, it is common for them to show their affection for one another in public.

1060
00:46:52,260 --> 00:46:56,180
It has even come to the point in which it can be rude, for example.

1061
00:46:56,180 --> 00:46:57,300
I would be talking to one of them.

1062
00:46:57,300 --> 00:46:59,380
Then the other will interrupt our conversation.

1063
00:46:59,380 --> 00:47:01,860
And they'll start smooching each other.

1064
00:47:02,660 --> 00:47:07,460
Is it not just me that has an issue with this number of our friends also find it uncomfortable?

1065
00:47:08,420 --> 00:47:11,140
What would you guys do in this situation?

1066
00:47:11,140 --> 00:47:15,300
So it's like you're talking about the latest episode of America's Next Top Model.

1067
00:47:15,300 --> 00:47:18,180
And then one of your friends is like, oh, hold up, smooch break.

1068
00:47:18,180 --> 00:47:21,380
I don't even think they're that polite about it.

1069
00:47:21,380 --> 00:47:22,740
I don't even think they interject like,

1070
00:47:22,740 --> 00:47:26,100
hold on, talking time is about to be put on hold while I get my smooch on.

1071
00:47:26,100 --> 00:47:34,900
Can you slide, can you crouch down low and then very slowly slide your face in between their faces?

1072
00:47:35,940 --> 00:47:37,540
And get kisses on your cheek.

1073
00:47:37,540 --> 00:47:39,380
I'm just gonna, excuse me.

1074
00:47:39,380 --> 00:47:41,540
Excuse me, let me just, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop.

1075
00:47:41,540 --> 00:47:45,220
So yeah, on the latest episode, Cory pulls this great prank.

1076
00:47:47,940 --> 00:47:51,140
I feel like if you made your displeasure with that known just like once,

1077
00:47:51,140 --> 00:47:53,460
it would be enough to shame them into stopping, right?

1078
00:47:53,460 --> 00:47:57,860
I mean, have you said like, hey, that's kind of rude.

1079
00:47:57,860 --> 00:48:00,020
Like, just say that.

1080
00:48:00,020 --> 00:48:02,180
Why is it like, hey, could you guys cool it a bit?

1081
00:48:02,180 --> 00:48:03,060
Just say that.

1082
00:48:04,740 --> 00:48:06,500
That's a little, do you know why?

1083
00:48:06,500 --> 00:48:06,980
Do you know why?

1084
00:48:06,980 --> 00:48:11,700
Because I'm developing a theory on this and I believe it is because in real life,

1085
00:48:12,260 --> 00:48:17,700
people would rather have that thing in their group that everybody can form around

1086
00:48:17,700 --> 00:48:20,420
and kind of bitch about quietly behind people's backs

1087
00:48:20,420 --> 00:48:24,580
than just address it and have it be done because it's more interesting.

1088
00:48:24,580 --> 00:48:26,500
Oh my God, you are getting real.

1089
00:48:27,220 --> 00:48:29,380
Yeah, right, but like I've seen that happen.

1090
00:48:29,380 --> 00:48:30,660
I've done that before where it's like,

1091
00:48:30,660 --> 00:48:33,860
it's more fun to bitch about the person behind their back

1092
00:48:33,860 --> 00:48:36,500
than it is to actually take steps to fix the problem.

1093
00:48:36,500 --> 00:48:39,940
Travis, that is such a good reminder and I think we've gone too long

1094
00:48:39,940 --> 00:48:44,820
without reminding people that it is, it is 2013.

1095
00:48:44,820 --> 00:48:45,300
That's true.

1096
00:48:45,300 --> 00:48:49,620
You are supposed to be getting out the dirt, washing it out, shaking it out.

1097
00:48:49,620 --> 00:48:51,700
And well, you can't really wash dirt, can you?

1098
00:48:53,860 --> 00:48:56,420
I'm just saying the thing you said, the thing you said was dumb and wrong.

1099
00:48:59,300 --> 00:49:02,340
When you try to wash dirt, it turns into mud and that's not especially clean.

1100
00:49:03,060 --> 00:49:05,380
Okay, then when you try to wash mud, it just goes away.

1101
00:49:05,380 --> 00:49:07,540
Okay, so then you're left with nothing.

1102
00:49:07,540 --> 00:49:09,780
You gotta bleach it and teach it, you know what I mean?

1103
00:49:10,980 --> 00:49:12,100
I don't know what that means.

1104
00:49:12,100 --> 00:49:12,740
I don't either.

1105
00:49:12,740 --> 00:49:15,380
Doesn't rhyme with 13 either, so what the fuck are you doing?

1106
00:49:15,380 --> 00:49:18,580
You gotta clean it and-

1107
00:49:18,580 --> 00:49:21,700
Clean rhymes with 13, like stop, put that part at the end.

1108
00:49:21,700 --> 00:49:23,300
You gotta clean it and screen it.

1109
00:49:25,540 --> 00:49:27,780
The screen keeps more of it from coming back.

1110
00:49:27,780 --> 00:49:29,620
So you clean it and then you screen it out.

1111
00:49:29,620 --> 00:49:31,060
Okay, wrap your friends-

1112
00:49:31,060 --> 00:49:33,140
2013, screen it and clean it.

1113
00:49:33,140 --> 00:49:35,140
Wrap your friends in a protective screen.

1114
00:49:35,140 --> 00:49:37,620
Have you thought about like a Faraday cage for your friends?

1115
00:49:40,180 --> 00:49:42,900
Oh, put your two friends in two separate Faraday cages

1116
00:49:42,900 --> 00:49:44,420
and that will keep them from coming back.

1117
00:49:44,420 --> 00:49:48,020
And that will keep their kissing electrons from meeting.

1118
00:49:48,020 --> 00:49:51,140
Put your friends in a box and then put a vial

1119
00:49:51,780 --> 00:49:53,860
full of harmful radiation in that box.

1120
00:49:53,860 --> 00:49:54,740
Maybe it'll break.

1121
00:49:54,740 --> 00:49:55,700
Maybe your friends are dead.

1122
00:49:55,700 --> 00:49:56,660
Maybe they're not.

1123
00:49:56,660 --> 00:49:59,220
You are existing in two universes simultaneously

1124
00:49:59,220 --> 00:50:02,180
where your friends are both necking and not necking.

1125
00:50:02,180 --> 00:50:03,300
Isn't that a little bit better?

1126
00:50:04,340 --> 00:50:04,900
No?

1127
00:50:04,900 --> 00:50:05,300
Okay.

1128
00:50:05,300 --> 00:50:05,940
Nope.

1129
00:50:05,940 --> 00:50:09,460
You're overwhelmed with existential dread?

1130
00:50:09,460 --> 00:50:09,940
Oh no.

1131
00:50:12,100 --> 00:50:12,740
Not again.

1132
00:50:12,740 --> 00:50:13,860
Not again, sorry.

1133
00:50:13,860 --> 00:50:14,500
We're not very good at this.

1134
00:50:14,500 --> 00:50:15,540
Or maybe not again.

1135
00:50:16,660 --> 00:50:17,460
We don't know.

1136
00:50:17,460 --> 00:50:18,180
We're not sure.

1137
00:50:18,180 --> 00:50:18,980
Open the box.

1138
00:50:18,980 --> 00:50:19,940
Don't open the box.

1139
00:50:19,940 --> 00:50:20,820
Don't open it.

1140
00:50:20,820 --> 00:50:22,020
Don't open that box.

1141
00:50:22,020 --> 00:50:22,580
But open it.

1142
00:50:22,580 --> 00:50:23,300
Not until Christmas.

1143
00:50:23,300 --> 00:50:24,420
You're gonna see some limbs.

1144
00:50:25,780 --> 00:50:26,020
Limbs all-

1145
00:50:26,020 --> 00:50:26,820
It's a Kimbo.

1146
00:50:26,820 --> 00:50:27,620
All a Kimbo.

1147
00:50:28,420 --> 00:50:31,540
It's gonna look like two giant Guy Fone Stevens in there.

1148
00:50:34,260 --> 00:50:37,620
Hey, thank you so much for hanging out with us again for another hour.

1149
00:50:37,620 --> 00:50:41,140
We hope you've enjoyed yourself half as much as we have.

1150
00:50:41,140 --> 00:50:41,940
Thank you to those Tweety Bucks-

1151
00:50:41,940 --> 00:50:43,140
That seems about accurate.

1152
00:50:43,140 --> 00:50:43,700
Yeah.

1153
00:50:43,700 --> 00:50:44,500
Matt Oldenburg.

1154
00:50:45,460 --> 00:50:47,460
I didn't enjoy myself all that much.

1155
00:50:47,460 --> 00:50:47,940
So 50% of that-

1156
00:50:47,940 --> 00:50:49,620
I will hope you don't put the muddle through it.

1157
00:50:49,620 --> 00:50:49,860
Yeah.

1158
00:50:49,860 --> 00:50:50,580
Just like we did.

1159
00:50:51,460 --> 00:50:52,340
Jordan B.

1160
00:50:52,340 --> 00:50:53,060
Megashurry.

1161
00:50:53,780 --> 00:50:54,740
Zacharias.

1162
00:50:54,740 --> 00:50:55,700
Scrooge McDunk.

1163
00:50:57,060 --> 00:50:57,940
Ray Frendan.

1164
00:50:58,580 --> 00:50:58,980
Sean.

1165
00:51:01,220 --> 00:51:01,860
Luke Gayne.

1166
00:51:02,580 --> 00:51:03,620
Don Zacharias.

1167
00:51:03,620 --> 00:51:05,060
Thank you so much for sharing the show.

1168
00:51:05,060 --> 00:51:06,020
We sure appreciate it.

1169
00:51:08,100 --> 00:51:08,600
A lot.

1170
00:51:09,700 --> 00:51:11,940
I want to thank John Roderick in the long winters.

1171
00:51:11,940 --> 00:51:14,100
I want to put myself out there,

1172
00:51:14,100 --> 00:51:16,100
make myself a little vulnerable for a second,

1173
00:51:16,100 --> 00:51:18,260
and just thank John Roderick in the long winters

1174
00:51:18,260 --> 00:51:19,220
for the use of our theme song,

1175
00:51:19,220 --> 00:51:20,340
It's a Departure,

1176
00:51:20,340 --> 00:51:21,860
off the album Putting the Days to Bed.

1177
00:51:21,860 --> 00:51:22,660
Heard a lot of people say,

1178
00:51:22,660 --> 00:51:24,260
Griffin, I bought Putting the Days to Bed.

1179
00:51:24,260 --> 00:51:25,460
Where do I go now?

1180
00:51:25,460 --> 00:51:26,820
How about when I pretend to fall?

1181
00:51:27,380 --> 00:51:29,540
How about the other one?

1182
00:51:31,220 --> 00:51:32,900
The Name of Which Escapes Me.

1183
00:51:32,900 --> 00:51:34,740
The Name of Which I Cannot Recall.

1184
00:51:34,740 --> 00:51:36,820
That would be a badass name for an album.

1185
00:51:36,820 --> 00:51:37,780
How about-

1186
00:51:37,780 --> 00:51:39,060
The Name of Which Escapes Me.

1187
00:51:39,060 --> 00:51:40,660
There's the Ultimatum EP.

1188
00:51:40,660 --> 00:51:41,940
That's one.

1189
00:51:41,940 --> 00:51:43,140
Lot of albums.

1190
00:51:43,140 --> 00:51:44,020
Maybe four or five.

1191
00:51:45,780 --> 00:51:47,300
Then John Roderick will make more for us.

1192
00:51:48,660 --> 00:51:49,860
He's just been waiting for you.

1193
00:51:50,740 --> 00:51:52,900
This whole podcast is basically a pyramid scheme

1194
00:51:52,900 --> 00:51:54,580
to get people to buy Long Winter's albums

1195
00:51:54,580 --> 00:51:55,460
so he can get that new one.

1196
00:51:55,460 --> 00:51:56,420
Anyway, thanks John Roderick.

1197
00:51:56,420 --> 00:51:57,220
Thanks Long Winters.

1198
00:51:57,940 --> 00:51:59,620
And then if you're looking for something else to listen to,

1199
00:51:59,620 --> 00:52:01,780
go check out the other Max Fun podcasts.

1200
00:52:02,500 --> 00:52:03,620
Stop podcasting yourself,

1201
00:52:03,620 --> 00:52:05,620
Throwing Shade, Jordan Jesse Goh, Bullseye.

1202
00:52:06,340 --> 00:52:07,860
And check out Sawbones.

1203
00:52:07,860 --> 00:52:13,540
It's a podcast all about pee pee.

1204
00:52:13,540 --> 00:52:15,460
It's not all about pee pee.

1205
00:52:15,460 --> 00:52:15,860
I mean-

1206
00:52:15,860 --> 00:52:17,780
I listened to this week's episode.

1207
00:52:17,780 --> 00:52:20,580
You guys talk about nothing but urine on your show.

1208
00:52:20,580 --> 00:52:22,740
It's a medical history show, but okay.

1209
00:52:22,740 --> 00:52:23,700
