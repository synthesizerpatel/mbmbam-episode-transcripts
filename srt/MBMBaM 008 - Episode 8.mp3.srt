1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,000
If you change your mind, I'm the first in line Honey I'm still free, take a chance on me

2
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:19,000
If you need me, let me know, I'm gonna be around If you got no place to go, when you're feeling down

3
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,000
If you're all alone, with a pretty verse

4
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Carve another notch in your bedpost, you've done it, you've made time in your week for us

5
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
My brother, my brother and me

6
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:39,000
This is an advice show for the modern era, I am Justin McElroy

7
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
I'm Travis McElroy, I'm Griffin McElroy

8
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000
And this has been my brother, my brother and me, the end

9
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Have a great week

10
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Have a great week, it's the beginning, don't worry about it

11
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Can we address?

12
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Okay

13
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Just right from the get

14
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
I'm addressing it

15
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,000
We fucked up

16
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Take it a head on

17
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Fucked up

18
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,000
We fucked up

19
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,000
We done fucked up

20
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,000
We done fucked up

21
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
We done y'all wrong

22
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:06,000
This show is like two weeks old, it's like a two week old infant

23
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,000
And we went ahead and we done skipped a week

24
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Done skipped a week

25
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Can we assign blame?

26
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Memorial Day, what's up?

27
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:19,000
So we're blaming Memorial Day for our malfeasance

28
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Memorial Day caused us to forget

29
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Yeah, we forgot to make the show for you

30
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Right

31
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Yeah, I'm eternally sorry

32
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,000
I want to apologize because I expected like we skip a week

33
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,000
And then all the love falls out the bottom

34
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
And we lose all the love

35
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:41,000
But I did a Twitter search for the title of our show yesterday

36
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
As I want to do

37
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,000
And still just a lot of people support

38
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
A lot of questions, not a lot of anger

39
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Mostly just sorrow

40
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
And I want to apologize

41
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
A deep hunger was the theme

42
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:59,000
I want to personally deeply apologize to little Badkins

43
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,000
He's a way fish young lad who lives on the streets

44
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
He was heart broke

45
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
He was, I'm so sorry Badkins

46
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
We'll send you some new matchsticks

47
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Can we just say, make it official

48
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Episode 008 right now, official decree

49
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,000
We will never miss another week ever again

50
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Until we die

51
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Until we die, and even then we'll get two more shows out

52
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Yeah, ghost shows

53
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Here's our first question

54
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Comes to us from FormSpring

55
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
FormSpring questions are anonymous

56
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
If you want to send a question to us

57
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Listen to the end of the show and we'll tell you how

58
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
I've been seeing this girl lately

59
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
And every time we have plans to hang out she bails on me

60
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
If we don't make plans

61
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
And I tell her I'm just going to show up

62
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
She's cool with it

63
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Is this a case of plans are meant to be broken

64
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Or is it something more

65
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Oh my friend

66
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
I didn't know that was an idiom

67
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
No dude, plans are meant to be broken

68
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
No actually, that's kind of counterintuitive

69
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
To what a plan is

70
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
They're actually meant to people do things

71
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
If plans

72
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
What's the difference between making plans

73
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
And telling her you're going to show up

74
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Is that not a plan?

75
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Is that not a thing?

76
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
That seems like an awfully narrow distinction

77
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
I think it seems like if you and I

78
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Should go somewhere

79
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Okay cool

80
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
I'm not going to do that

81
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
I'm going to be at a place

82
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Are you going to be at that same place?

83
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
We'll see

84
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
I think maybe she's just not

85
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Necessarily

86
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Into this relationship right now

87
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Or maybe she just loves

88
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Scavenger hunts

89
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Have we considered that?

90
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Maybe she likes to pretend it's serendipitous

91
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
She doesn't want to meet you

92
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
She wants to find you

93
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
And a lot of the times

94
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
We try to tell ourselves with stuff like that

95
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Maybe she's just the type of person

96
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
That breaks plans

97
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
And she's all willy nilly and crazy

98
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
No, she just doesn't want to hang out with you

99
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
She is the type of person

100
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
That doesn't particularly care for you

101
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
So much anymore

102
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Plans are meant to be broken

103
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Hey they are

104
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
My GF

105
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
I'm a different person now

106
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
She's always wanting to go out to dinner

107
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
But she expects me to romantically choose

108
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Where to eat and pay

109
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Despite the fact that she pretty much

110
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Always eats steak no matter where we go

111
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Also money is tight

112
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Should I cave to her demands?

113
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
My suggestion

114
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Plan on a really fancy dinner

115
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
And tell her about it and then don't go

116
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
And she'll look at you like what?

117
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
And you'll be like plans are meant to be broken

118
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Can I just say how much I love

119
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
The concept of romantically choosing

120
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Where to eat dinner

121
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Like baby girl

122
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
I've been thinking about it for a long time

123
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
But I think

124
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Golden corral

125
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Golden corral girl

126
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
You want to get some of them hot buttery rolls

127
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Sensual rolls

128
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Sensual rolls

129
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Um no

130
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
She wants you to be in charge

131
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Like a man say this is where we're going tonight

132
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Steco

133
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Also start calling your

134
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Call your GF Steco

135
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
She'll love it

136
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Yeah and also

137
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Don't let your girlfriend eat steak everywhere you go

138
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
What's the matter with her

139
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
It's not healthy

140
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Take her to a vegan restaurant

141
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
And see if her head implodes

142
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Next time she buys steak just cough

143
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
And be like please choose another option

144
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Cough

145
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Please choose the chicken

146
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
She'll have the chicken

147
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Are you dating a caveman maybe

148
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Or a feral wolf

149
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Maybe you should romantically order for her

150
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
She'll have the chicken

151
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Thank you Garcon

152
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
As dry as possible please

153
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Another form spring question

154
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Does my best man have to be a man

155
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
My closest confidants

156
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Are all female

157
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
And I have just casual mostly

158
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Uncaring relationships with the majority of

159
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Guys in my life

160
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
His closest what

161
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Confidants

162
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
That's how they say it

163
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
In France

164
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
I don't

165
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
I don't know that's awfully progressive

166
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
I don't have a problem with it one bit

167
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Yeah

168
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
No you wouldn't

169
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Well I have a lot of female friends

170
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Right but we'll never have to deal with this

171
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Because we've already agreed that we're going to be

172
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Each other's best man

173
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
This is correct

174
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
We've signed that blood pact

175
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
I forget how it breaks down

176
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Alright

177
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
What if like Steve Gutenberg

178
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Rolls up the day of my wedding and is like

179
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Hey I've got like two hours to kill

180
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Could I do it? That's fine

181
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Would you understand Justin?

182
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Oh what if for the Goots?

183
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Yeah when the Goots in there

184
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
The only thing I would wish is that we could be co-best men

185
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
And I could go to things remembered

186
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
And have a co-best men

187
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Necklace made that would be broken into

188
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Two parts with two separate chains

189
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
So it would be like a dead hooker

190
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Or a death stripper

191
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
And one of you would get one part and one of you would get the other

192
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
And when you link it up it shows

193
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
It shows

194
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
That you are co-best men right

195
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Also I want to kill a hook with Steve Gutenberg

196
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Once again we've created

197
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
The greatest movie idea ever

198
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
The new Steve Gutenberg

199
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Vehicle co-best men

200
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
That sounds like

201
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
An Adam Sandler movie

202
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
No it's Steve Gutenberg and Dave Coulier

203
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Kevin James and Adam Sandler in co-best men

204
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Hey guys

205
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
You can do it

206
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Can we give this guy some real advice

207
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Yeah

208
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
I think it's okay

209
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Yeah it's fine

210
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
But make her wear a tux

211
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Hey can I say this? It's your wedding so tell everybody to eat a bacon

212
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Yeah

213
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
In this scenario would you

214
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Have to refer to her as best man still?

215
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
I would say best woman

216
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
I think I would still go with best man

217
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
I was kidding about the tux

218
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
But I think

219
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Talk to your fiance first

220
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Gender switching

221
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Is not that

222
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Sydney had

223
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Guys in her party but they weren't bridesmaids

224
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
They were bridesmen

225
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Can you have groomsmen?

226
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
I had to walk down the aisle

227
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
With one of them

228
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
It may be best maid

229
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Best lady

230
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
You should probably marry your best lady

231
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
You have to realize

232
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
That's what's going to happen

233
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Day of the wedding

234
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Right before you get cold feet

235
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Your lady friend

236
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Confesses her

237
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Your wife might have a problem with that

238
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
That's what I'm saying

239
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Talk to your fiance first

240
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
My official advice is I don't know

241
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Is your best woman going to be

242
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Jennifer Lopez?

243
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
If so you're definitely

244
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Going to switch over at the last second

245
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Hey you know

246
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Guys I have this problem

247
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Every time I talk to some stranger on the phone

248
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
They mistake me for a woman

249
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
What can I do in the future to prevent this?

250
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
I don't drink whiskey or smoke so forget about that

251
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Yeah are you 12?

252
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
That you don't drink whiskey or smoke?

253
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Maybe pick up one of those and we'll meet you halfway

254
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Could I suggest

255
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Either saying your name

256
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
But what if your name is like Aaron

257
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Double A Aaron

258
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
And that doesn't help the matter at all

259
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
So to cut any confusion I would say

260
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Just call a person up

261
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
And they say hello

262
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
And you say hi this is Aaron

263
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Man can we

264
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Hi this is Aaron I'm a fella

265
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
And let's keep going

266
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
I'm known dude Aaron

267
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
You should do

268
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
My name's Aaron got a wiener can we talk?

269
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
My suggestion would obviously

270
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Be to talk like Christian Bale

271
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
From the Batman movies

272
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
You reach Aaron's residence

273
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
I'm a Russian chicken

274
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
I want a chick

275
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
I'm gonna wear an

276
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
Augie Paz

277
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Or just go with it

278
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
That's not your problem if they think you're a woman

279
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
That's their problem

280
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
And their embarrassment when they realize

281
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
The faux pas they've made that's a power play dude

282
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Some people are paid

283
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Big money to live life as a woman

284
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
And they get the full taste of it for free

285
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
If you could do

286
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
You could leverage that if you were

287
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
In the

288
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
Telemarketing industry

289
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Leverage it in the sense that

290
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
I think female telemarketers

291
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Probably are more successful than dudes

292
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
Cause they can call up lonely dudes

293
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
And you know

294
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Get a foot in the door

295
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Telemarketresses?

296
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Telemarketrinas

297
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Telemarketrinas

298
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
Yeah just go with it

299
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
I've known a girl for a while

300
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
And since I got back from college for summer

301
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
We've been hanging out a lot

302
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
But I'm not sure if I can make it a relationship

303
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Because we go to school 100 miles apart

304
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
Advice

305
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
100 miles ain't nothing

306
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
100 miles is a

307
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
Pretty long distance actually

308
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
No it's like 2 hours

309
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
I say don't date a girl

310
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
Who lives farther away from you

311
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
I was gonna say that you could walk

312
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
To but that's

313
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Probably better

314
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
Could you throw in a pinch

315
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
I could throw a shot put

316
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
100 to 150 yards

317
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
That's why my wife lives with me

318
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
In my house

319
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
How far do you think you could throw a baseball?

320
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
About 5 feet

321
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
50 feet

322
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
You think you could clear it from the mount?

323
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
I'd get it at home play

324
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Oh yeah I'd get it at home play

325
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
Funky of the year and they'd hire me on

326
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
Funky butt loving

327
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
Funky butt loving?

328
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
What?

329
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
Here's my advice

330
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
Would you give him a high stinky cheddar?

331
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
Yes I would

332
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
This young person has already

333
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
Answered their own question

334
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
You don't think you can make it a relationship

335
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
Guess what? You're not gonna

336
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
You would know

337
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
He's unsure

338
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
Yeah but he would know

339
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
If it's a cross country trip

340
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
If 2 hours isn't worth it to you

341
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
Then I think you've already answered your own question

342
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
Real life

343
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
Is gonna work really hard

344
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
In every relationship

345
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
To try to tear it down

346
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
If you're not sold on it from the jump

347
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
It's not gonna pan out

348
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
If she's the one

349
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
You wouldn't be asking us this question

350
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
If you were sure about it

351
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
You wouldn't trust us to the reality of a long distance relationship

352
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
Is way harder than you think it would be

353
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
100 miles apart

354
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
You know where I live 100 miles from?

355
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
Kings Island, I don't get there

356
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
And you love Kings Island, that's the relationship

357
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
I do, I love the Viking

358
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
Fury, I wanna make that relationship

359
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
Beautiful boat

360
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
Let's do one from Yahoo

361
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
This one comes from Chris D

362
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
Chris R?

363
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
Not Chris R, Chris D

364
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
Please help

365
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
Where should we make out?

366
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
Well, me and my girlfriend

367
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
Are both going into 9th grade

368
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
We're both 14 and she wants to make out

369
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
Where should we make out?

370
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
And this is my first make out

371
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
So any tips would be great, thanks

372
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
I heard like during a movie

373
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
In the theaters, but I don't know

374
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
Any places would be great, thanks

375
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
Easy 10 points

00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
I think if any places are great

377
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
You should stop worrying about it so much

378
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
Dude, you can't

379
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
Has it been so long

380
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
Since you went into 9th grade

381
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
And we're about to have your first make out sesh

382
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
That you can't recall the mortal

383
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
Terror that is involved with

384
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
Finding a locale for this

385
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
To go down

386
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
This is hard, now it's suddenly hard

387
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
Yeah, cause I can recall

388
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
Exactly, and I also recall

389
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
The

390
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
Unorthodox

391
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
Solution that I came up with

392
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
Oh Christ

393
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
It was in Ritter Park

394
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
Which is a park

395
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
That was a few blocks from my house

396
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
In our hometown of Huntington, West Virginia

397
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
And there's a

398
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
There's a little

399
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
Concave, like a little

400
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
Circle

401
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
A little stone circle

402
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
Of benches that's kind of hidden

403
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
Beneath the shady trees

404
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
But

405
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
I think that that circle was

406
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
Constructed as

407
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
A monument to

408
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
AIDS

409
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
Yes, it's the AIDS circle

410
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
Which is probably

411
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
I don't know

412
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
Disrespectful

413
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
Maybe not romantic, maybe not the most

414
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
Romantic thing I've ever done in my life

415
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
But you have to get your make out on

416
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
And you have to do it in a place where your folks won't catch you

417
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
Did you wrap it up?

418
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
Cause that would have been disrespectful

419
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
Yeah, definitely, I played it smart

420
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
Even at 14

421
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
I find dens

422
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
Dens and basements

423
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
Dens and basements are awesome

424
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
Friends tree houses

425
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
Parents can't stay up forever, dawg

426
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
They're old

427
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
I'm almost parent age, trust me

428
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
You can't stay up that long

429
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
You'll outlast them

430
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
I don't think I've

431
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
I never, ever, ever got fresh in a movie

432
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
If I see you making out in a movie

433
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
I'm gonna fucking smack you

434
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
If you're gonna do it

435
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
Sit in the back

436
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
Cause people paid so much money to go to that movie

437
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
They don't need to hear you're smacking

438
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
But it's in 3D

439
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
Here's the thing

440
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
Right now you're paying 12 bucks

441
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
To get into a movie

442
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
15 bucks, don't waste that money

443
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
Watch the damn movie

444
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
That's 15 dollars

445
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
You're halfway to a cheap hourly motel

446
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
Unless the movie

447
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
Is really bad and you can add

448
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
Some humor to it

449
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
You know, like

450
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
Train my dragon

451
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
If you're in the middle of it

452
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
I like that one

453
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
There are people like me that will sit

454
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
Uncomfortably close to you

455
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
So that you are not able to do that

456
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
On the note that I just brought up

457
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
I wouldn't do it in like a kid's movie

458
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
Don't go to like a generated movie

459
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
Some of us have

460
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
Made out during Toy Story 2

461
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
Yeah

462
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
It was creep

463
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
Flubber

464
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
Dear podcast

465
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
Okay, kind of inhuman

466
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
Last night I went to my friend's

467
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
21st birthday party when suddenly his girlfriend

468
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
Who was very drunk told me

469
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
She had feelings for me

470
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
I don't feel the same about her

471
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
So my question is how do I or even

472
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
Do I tell my friend

473
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
Okay, hold on

474
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
You're at

475
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
Your friend's birthday party

476
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
His lady tells you

477
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
She has feelings for you

478
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
You don't have feelings for you

479
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
Guess what you got buddy

480
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
You got a little something I like to call a non-problem

481
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
You do not have an issue

482
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
That you need to address

483
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
Here's the important

484
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
Little segment there

485
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
She was very drunk

486
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
Doesn't matter

487
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
I say things

488
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
Say things you wouldn't believe

489
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
It's astonishing how many questions we get

490
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
Where my answer is just pack up

491
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
And move away and never talk to anyone

492
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
Involved in a scenario again

493
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
Because that's literally the only

494
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
The only solution I have for this

495
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
Maybe that's why I've been such a globetrotter these past few years

496
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
You keep messing up social

497
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
Situations and you gotta move

498
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
In my mind this is unfixable

499
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
And you have to get out of there

500
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
It's called a global reset

501
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
You can either stick around, don't say anything

502
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
And then have it be awkward forever

503
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
Or you can tell your friend and he'll get mad

504
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
At you and

505
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
You know

506
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
Here's what I'd do if I was you

507
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
Don't

508
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
Don't say anything

509
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
But frequently

510
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
Ask your friend how his relationship

511
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
Is going and then when he answers

512
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
You say oh yeah? Cool

513
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
I guess

514
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
Can I suggest a honeypot

515
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
Scenario

516
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
Where you tell the

517
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
Friend and then if he doesn't believe

518
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
You'd be like no no no check it out

519
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
And then you

520
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
You get the friend drunk

521
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
No well no that's exploitative

522
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
But you know

523
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
You were gonna suggest a baiting situation

524
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
Yes get her to confess those feelings again

525
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
I like that

526
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
Like you're wearing a wire

527
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
Or your friend is like hidden in the closet

528
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
And ask her about the new package

529
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
And ask her where Omar is

530
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
I assume that's a joke

531
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
Cause we haven't washed the wire

532
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
Yeah

533
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
You need to talk to your friend's girlfriend is what you need to do

534
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
No you don't need to tell

535
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
Oh shit people don't want to hear about things

536
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
They don't want to talk about them

537
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
Your two options are honeypot or move the fuck away

538
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
Change your name

539
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
Change your name

540
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
I'm gonna switch these gmail

541
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
Gmail questions cause these people have their names on them

542
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
Ender

543
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
I know right

544
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
Ender writes tons of people I went to high school

545
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
With are already about to get married

546
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
Or are married and I've only been out of high school

547
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
For two years what am I missing here

548
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
A girlfriend

549
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
Yeah let me throw in a little side note here

550
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
This email comes to us from Utah

551
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
I don't know if that changes

552
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
Your outlook on this but it does for me

553
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
So they get married

554
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
Like six years earlier than

555
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
Probably the median age in the nation

556
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
I think that's a fair

557
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
Figure

558
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
What you're missing is a partner to go through life with

559
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
And you are going to die alone

560
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
Ender you're not missing anything

561
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,000
You're 20 years old

562
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
You're kicking it living it large in Utah

563
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
Yeah

564
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
Going to jazz games

565
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
Listening to jazz games and

566
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
Listening to jazz and

567
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
Going to jazz basketball games

568
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
Just jazzing

569
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
In general

570
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
You need to stop all that jazz and get yourself a girlfriend

571
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
I don't

572
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
Are you going to college

573
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
Well he didn't say he's going to college

574
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
He said he's been out of high school for two years

575
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
Just pair up quick

576
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
Cause your options are dwindling everyday

577
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
I'm probably the only person from Huntington

578
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,000
Who's not married

579
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,000
And I

580
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
I'm so fucking lonely

581
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
All the time Ender do it just find someone

582
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
Anyone

583
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
You know one of my friends once told me

584
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
Who was married he said marriage isn't a goal

585
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
Marriage isn't something you work towards

586
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
It's something that happens

587
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
So

588
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
It is a goal in the sense that if you don't cross it

589
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
By the time you die then you've failed it

590
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
Yes

591
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
Whatever it's a goal if you don't cross it by the time you're 30

592
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,000
It comes out

593
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
Speed it up Ender

594
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,000
Matt writes to us from gmail

595
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
Says myself and my friend

596
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,000
And my brother and me

597
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
That's not true just myself and my friend

598
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,000
Myself and my friend recently went for the same job

599
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,000
And he got it ahead of me

600
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
Do you have any advice for how to

601
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,000
Deal with this

602
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
Yeah keep your mouth shut Matt

603
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,000
Move to a different town

604
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
Just move away dude

605
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
No I mean that sucks

606
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,000
That sucks pretty royally but

607
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
You gotta ask yourself what would he do

608
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,000
If the scenario was switch

609
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
And it sounds like he's a really good friend

610
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,000
And that he wouldn't

611
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
Cause a big stink about it

612
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
I think in any situation even if he would do that

613
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
You gotta be the bigger man

614
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,000
And if he's really your friend you gotta be happy for him

615
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,000
You know what I mean

616
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,000
Yeah

617
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,000
At the end of the day what is more important the job you went for

618
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,000
And the friendship with this kid

619
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
Well the job

620
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,000
Probably

621
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,000
It sounds like a great gig

622
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,000
With a nice big salary and lots of benefits

623
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,000
And also Matt

624
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,000
He's probably more qualified than you

625
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,000
He probably got it based on merit

626
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,000
He deserves it

627
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,000
He earned it What did you do

628
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,000
Wow

629
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,000
Good jobs Matt

630
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,000
Can we give Matt an internship

631
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,000
At NBNBAM Industries

632
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,000
Matt is the first intern of NBNBAM Industries

633
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,000
What's he gonna do

634
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,000
He's gonna promote the show

635
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,000
Is it paid

636
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,000
He's gonna sell tribes and away slavery

637
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,000
Can we scrounge some money together

638
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,000
To give this guy a salary do you think

639
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
If I get any money I'm gonna spend it on a Facebook

640
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,000
App for our show

641
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,000
Yeah that's true

642
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,000
6x9

643
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,000
Who's a known gmail user

644
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,000
Asks I've recently moved

645
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,000
To the states from Australia

646
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,000
And I'd like to find a low calorie

647
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,000
Beer to drink I have no problem

648
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,000
Sampling from your wide selection of microbrews

649
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,000
On occasion but I'd really like a nice beer to drink

650
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,000
Regularly and I don't need the extra

651
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,000
Calories I'm looking for a taste sensation

652
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,000
But something that tastes better

653
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,000
Than brackish water would be nice

654
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,000
Any suggestions PBR

655
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,000
He asked PBR

656
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,000
Get out of this website

657
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,000
Get off the podcast

658
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,000
I mean you can't go wrong with an MGD-64

659
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,000
How about I slap both of you

660
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,000
In the mouth

661
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,000
That's the only low calorie beer I mean

662
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,000
No okay let me

663
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,000
Hip you guys because you're

664
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,000
Like children you're like an infant

665
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,000
Tickling yourself with a razor

666
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,000
Number one

667
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,000
Is your an

668
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,000
Infant tickling yourself with a razor

669
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,000
The best low

670
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,000
Calorie beer is Guinness

671
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,000
Which clocks in at

672
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,000
125 calories per bottle

673
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,000
That's high calorie

674
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,000
That's not comparatively high

675
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,000
Calories the idea that beer

676
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,000
Has calories in it

677
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,000
Is astonishing to me

678
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,000
I don't know why I've never been able

679
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,000
If you drink too much beer you get fat

680
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,000
My brain has never been able to

681
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,000
It's a liquid

682
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,000
It's not a food

683
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,000
Have you tried pork chunk

684
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:42,000
Ale

685
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,000
I don't think it's real

686
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,000
I would say that

687
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,000
Your top three

688
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,000
I think Guinness is good

689
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,000
Right after that I think the

690
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,000
Two best light beers you can get

691
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,000
Are

692
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,000
Sam Adams Light and

693
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,000
So if it has light on it

694
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,000
Then that's what that means

695
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,000
You would be surprised

696
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,000
I would actually check calorie

697
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,000
Comparisons

698
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,000
A lot of those light beers

699
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,000
Are not as low calorie

700
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,000
As

701
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,000
Like a Guinness or something like that

702
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,000
Guinness is low in calories

703
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,000
I'll tell you what I had a lot of

704
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,000
When I was up Shytown

705
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,000
Is that light?

706
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,000
Would you say that's light

707
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,000
I would say that's probably

708
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,000
Ripping with calories

709
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,000
It felt airy in my mouth

710
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,000
It had an airy quality to it

711
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,000
I would say go with that

712
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,000
And don't worry about the calories

713
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,000
Because you deserve it

714
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,000
Girl

715
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,000
You're worth it girl

716
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,000
130 calories per bottle

717
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,000
Not bad at all

718
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,000
Also

719
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,000
Jack and Diet Coke

720
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,000
It saved you a bunch of calories

721
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,000
Dominic

722
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,000
Says I'm trying to be more outgoing

723
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,000
And looking for more venues to meet people

724
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,000
And possible relationships

725
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,000
Would church groups be a good start?

726
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,000
Even though I'm not particularly

727
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,000
Churchy

728
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,000
Or do you have any other suggestions?

729
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,000
Okay Dominic

730
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,000
That won't be a great conversation starter

731
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,000
Hey what's going on

732
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,000
Mallory

733
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,000
No I'm not particularly churchy

734
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,000
I'm not churchy

735
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,000
This is apparently working for you

736
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,000
I think so

737
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,000
I made a lot of good connections

738
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,000
In

739
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,000
Church

740
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,000
My old church

741
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,000
I actually went out to dinner last night

742
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,000
With old Alex White

743
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,000
Good people

744
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,000
I don't know if he's thinking

745
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,000
About love

746
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,000
Relationships

747
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,000
I think maybe he's just talking about friendships

748
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,000
And if that's the way to go

749
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,000
Now if you're looking for someone

750
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,000
Who's going to give up to pussy

751
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,000
God

752
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,000
Well

753
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,000

Oh man

762
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,000
Dick asks

763
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,000
If there is no oxygen in space

764
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,000
Then how does the sun burn?

765
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,000

He's got you there

769
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,000
Game over

770
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,000
Fuck

771
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,000
Ah shit

772
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,000
I don't have an answer for that

773
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,000
I know you don't

774
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,000
Hey do you guys see what Dick said?

775
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,000
Fuck we're all ruined

776
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,000
There are

777
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,000
Like 300

778
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,000
Theology professors across the country

779
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,000
Who just like

780
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,000
Exploded

781
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,000
Oh wait a minute

782
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,000
Dick just solved it for all of us

783
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,000
Everyone knows that the sun burns cause the devil lives inside

784
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,000
Yup the devil lives in the sun

785
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,000
Duh what's up

786
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,000
It's your first night at the rodeo apparently

787
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,000
I have to thank

788
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,000
I did a little bit of

789
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,000
Crowd sourcing that question

790
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,000
Was actually sent to me by

791
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,000
Godly is the person's name

792
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,000
Who sent that to me so thanks Godly shout outs

793
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,000
Shout outs

794
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,000
I've been having problems

795
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,000
With expressing my anger

796
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,000
Says Sean from Gmail

797
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,000
And I was wondering if you could help

798
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,000
I'm a 17 year old New Zealander and over here

799
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,000
Any showing of anger to anyone

800
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,000
Will often result in a physical fight

801
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,000
I have the problem that I seem to

802
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,000
Either bottle it up

803
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,000
I've been meditating late

804
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,000
And it seems to help a little in thinking about things

805
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,000
Or completely fly off the handle and hurt people badly

806
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,000
I was wondering if you guys could help

807
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,000
Hey Sean

808
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,000
Hi

809
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,000
Sean

810
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,000
You're a

811
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,000
You're talking to three guys

812
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,000
Who are raised Baptist if you're looking

813
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,000
For guys who are telling you to not bottle

814
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,000
It up you've come to the wrong podcast

815
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,000
Keep it inside

816
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,000
Or get to your bottle

817
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,000
Breaks and then you get a bigger bottle

818
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,000
I don't

819
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,000
I don't know

820
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,000
I can't I think the last time

821
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,000
I got angry was when I was

822
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,000
I was

823
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,000
Making a left turn onto

824
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,000
The interstate and someone behind me

825
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,000
Was upset by the fact that I was making

826
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,000
A left turn so they passed me and gave me

827
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,000
The finger and I just wanted to get out

828
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,000
Of my car and

829
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,000
Just

830
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,000
Hurt them

831
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,000
I'm so bad at it see

832
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,000
Would you rather be Sean the guy who

833
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,000
Expresses his

834
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,000
Feeling in a healthy way or Sean

835
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,000
The guy who at any second

836
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,000
Could fucking flip and fight somebody

837
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,000
I kind of like the last

838
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,000
Sean yeah right

839
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,000
That Sean's cool that Sean's crazy

840
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,000
Like Sean's crazy

841
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,000
Nobody knows what the fuck Sean's about to do

842
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,000
What's Sean doing now

843
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,000
Sean's drinking everybody stops

844
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,000
Looks at Sean real slow

845
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,000
And maybe this time Sean laughs it off

846
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,000
But next time fucking Sean

847
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,000
Is basically a human

848
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,000
Version of Kerplunk

849
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,000
Yeah only the marbles are his

850
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,000
Rage and every time you

851
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,000
Scuff his pumas you're pulling a stick

852
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,000
Out

853
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,000
And once you step on that

854
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,000
Poo that wrong time you're sunk

855
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,000
Also Sean in real advice

856
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,000
You're 17 dude you're a wash of hormones

857
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,000
And emotion yeah completely normal

858
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,000
You will calm down as you get older

859
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,000
Meditation's the best way to go

860
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,000
Just think about everything someone's

861
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,000
Scuffing your pumas not a time

862
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,000
To pull the stick out no if you

863
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,000
I mean if he's 17

864
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,000
If you don't let that anger out

865
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,000
Then you'll get really bad acne

866
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,000
That's where

867
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,000
Those hormones gotta work

868
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,000
Them out of your body little anger volcanoes

869
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,000
I actually saw

870
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,000
A dermatologist when I was 17

871
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,000
I had really bad skin she said

872
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,000
You got lots of anger volcanoes on your face

873
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,000
Thanks

874
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,000
What's Sean

875
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,000
Don't hurt anybody Sean

876
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,000
Everybody

877
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,000
Don't follow our advice ever

878
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,000
Dude have you guys heard about Cody

879
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,000
From Gmail where he's going

880
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,000
Next weekend no

881
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,000
He's taking a trip up with his

882
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,000
Family up to Canada

883
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,000
Oh Canada I like it up there. Homeland of

884
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,000
Rafi

885
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,000
I love to drink

886
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,000
And I'm 19 years old which means

887
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,000
I can drink in Canada however

888
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,000
My mom hates that I drink

889
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,000
How can I get shit faced in Canada

890
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,000
Without my mother getting upset

891
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,000
Cody

892
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,000
I have great news for you

893
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,000
This is a wonderful

894
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,000
Time

895
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,000
To start practicing the art of

896
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,000
Flaskmanship

897
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,000
She don't need to know anything

898
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,000
She turns away for 30

899
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,000
10 8 seconds

900
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,000
You got that flask out you pound it

901
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,000
You're done

902
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,000
I would say also that it sounds like

903
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,000
Laws aren't keeping you from drinking

904
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,000
So much in the US of A

905
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,000
So what's the concern

906
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,000
Well there's a difference

907
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,000
There's a difference between

908
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:12,000
Our laws

909
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,000
And statutes and mama

910
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,000
Law mama law

911
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,000
I think he might be afraid of

912
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,000
Transgressing

913
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,000
On mama laws

914
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,000
Which I understand

915
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,000
Maybe what he's saying

916
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,000
Is the reason he's excited about drinking is because

917
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,000
It's legal right what I'm saying

918
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,000
Is it doesn't seem to be slowing down

919
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,000
Although I'm sure the beer in Canada is so

920
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,000
Dope

921
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,000
Cody why do you need to get shit faced

922
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,000
As you put it

923
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,000
Can you not just

924
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,000
Have a beer or two

925
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,000
Do you have a

926
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,000
Do you have an eye opener Cody

927
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,000
Do you ever have an eye opener do you ever drink alone

928
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,000
Again I

929
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,000
Would you say your mom has a problem

930
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,000
With it do you mean she keeps having interventions

931
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,000
For you because that's a different thing altogether

932
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,000
I've got

933
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,000
A Canada fetish so I imagine

934
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,000
Everything is cooler in Canada maybe

935
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,000
Getting drunk in Canada is like the sweetest

936
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,000
Thing ever like maybe a mount he sees you

937
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:10,000
On the street and instead of arresting

938
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,000
You like he gets off his horse he's like hey go

939
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,000
Ahead just take one around the block

940
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,000
Winnie

941
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,000
Maybe

942
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,000
Getting fucked up and eating poutine

943
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,000
Is like you know

944
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,000
A religious experience

945
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,000
Joel writes to us

946
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,000
From Gmail he says I'm in a bit of a

947
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,000
Predicament I recently moved to a new

948
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,000
Town and I only know a few people I'm not

949
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,000
In college so I can't meet people that way

950
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,000
And I'm 19 so I can't meet people in bars

951
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,000
Can you guys put your heads together and

952
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,000
Give me some pointers on how to meet people and make friends

953
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,000
Joel started the D&D group

954
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,000
That's a really good I'm actually

955
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,000
You're joking but I met a lot of people

956
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,000
That way I'm not joking I think that would be fun

957
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,000
Give a call to Dominic and go to church

958
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,000
With him sometime

959
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,000
He just wants to tell you about a friend of his his name

960
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,000
Is Jesus on the serious on on Justin's

961
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,000
First point there's a website called meet up

962
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,000
You can use that to find groups of people

963
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,000
That have your interest maybe not D&D maybe knitting

964
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,000
Maybe scrapbooking maybe that's

965
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,000
Joel's game you can find a group

966
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,000
And do that thing with them

967
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,000
I wish he had told us what city he was in

968
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,000
And then we could have some MBMBAM

969
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,000
Like friendship connections

970
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:16,000
Here's what we'll do Joel go to Facebook

971
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:18,000
Go on our appreciation group

972
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,000
Put some stats

973
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,000
Some things you're into the city you're into

974
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,000
We'll make that connection

975
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,000
Height weight eye color

976
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,000
Basically a match.com profile

977
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,000
But put it in our Facebook group

978
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,000
And then see if you can find any

979
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,000
People should be using our Facebook group for friendship

980
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:36,000
And love connections I know

981
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,000
I wish more people were doing that

982
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,000
I want by our next show to have at least one

983
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,000
Piece of verifiable evidence

984
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,000
Of two kids who found each other

985
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,000
On the Facebook group got together

986
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,000
And fucked

987
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,000
What kind of verifiable evidence

988
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:54,000
Are you looking for? Kicks

989
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:56,000
Jesus

990
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,000
Here's one

991
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,000
Yahoo answer also sent

992
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,000
To me by Action Allen

993
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:04,000
Thank you Action Allen this one comes from Kyle S

994
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,000
He asks

995
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,000
I need a list of the

996
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,000
Most practical kicks

997
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,000
What?

998
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,000
What? Oh just you wait

999
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,000
I want a list of kicks

1000
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:18,000
All must be practical and where they would land

1001
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:20,000
So far the obvious ones

1002
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,000
Front kick to groin

1003
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:24,000
Mid area head

1004
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,000
I'm sorry

1005
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,000
Side kick to groin

1006
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,000
Mid area I personally don't like

1007
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,000
This one because it's hard to see

1008
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,000
Round kick

1009
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,000
To lower leg back of knee

1010
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,000
All suggestions are welcome

1011
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,000
I'm about to kick the spirit

1012
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,000
Yeah how about

1013
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,000
Below to your subconscious

1014
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,000
Hey listen

1015
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:50,000
Why do you need this list?

1016
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,000
Sean what are you doing?

1017
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:54,000
Guys can we get

1018
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,000
He's got the front he's got the side he's got the round

1019
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,000
Have you considered a donkey kick?

1020
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,000
A back kick as it's

1021
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,000
Referred to it in some circles where

1022
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,000
An assailant comes behind you

1023
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,000
You can usually kick the front

1024
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,000
Of their knee or groin area

1025
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:10,000
And that will completely take them

1026
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:12,000
Out of the fight all together

1027
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,000
Have you tried a spin kick?

1028
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,000
Spin kick's really good

1029
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:18,000
That's the coolest kick you can do

1030
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,000
When the point of your boot goes into their

1031
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,000
Butthole

1032
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,000
A butthole kick

1033
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:26,000
A butthole boot knocker

1034
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,000
A well aimed butthole kick

1035
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,000
Have you tried perhaps like a

1036
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,000
Ryu style bicycle kick where you fly

1037
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:34,000
Through the air for 10 seconds and squeal

1038
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:36,000
Like a pig? How about an awesome kick

1039
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:38,000
Where you literally take their head off

1040
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,000
And one cleans it

1041
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,000
Have you tried the mental kick

1042
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,000
Where you don't actually kick

1043
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,000
But they think that you do

1044
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:48,000
And then in three days their stocks crash

1045
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,000
What about the kick where you

1046
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,000
Take your foot off and make the guy smell your foot

1047
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:54,000
Like in a funny movie

1048
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,000
The Zoans

1049
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:58,000
That Zoan movie. That's pretty funny

1050
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:00,000
Have you tried a taint kick?

1051
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,000
What?

1052
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:04,000
A taint kick where you kick them square in the tank

1053
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,000
And it lifts them off of the ground and into the air

1054
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,000
By about three feet

1055
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,000
That one's really hard to do. Could I suggest a kick kick?

1056
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,000
Which is where you kick their kick

1057
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:14,000
And disrupt their kick

1058
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:16,000
They're meant to kick

1059
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,000
You gotta be careful though because if you don't time it right

1060
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,000
They'll kick your kick and then you're fucked

1061
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,000
That's a kick kick kick

1062
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:24,000
The triple kick. The KKK

1063
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,000
Have you tried a punch kick?

1064
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:28,000
Which is where you take your shoe off

1065
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,000
And put it on your hand

1066
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,000
And then you punch them with it

1067
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:38,000
Oh god

1068
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,000
That's a pretty

1069
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:42,000
Comprehensive list I feel

1070
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,000
Yeah I think that's all the kicks

1071
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:46,000
That's all the kicks I know about I guess

1072
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,000
What about the junior kick where you kick their kid?

1073
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:54,000
Yeah that's sometimes more painful

1074
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,000
In the long run I mean

1075
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:00,000
What do you think? One more question?

1076
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,000
Before the last question? Yeah

1077
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,000
You got time for one more? Griffin you pick

1078
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:06,000
You pick this time

1079
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:08,000
This one comes from Allison via Gmail

1080
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:10,000
I like a sociable smart

1081
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:12,000
Funny nerdy guy

1082
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:14,000
But I don't know where to find them

1083
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:16,000
Why'd you pick this one? Weird

1084
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,000
I don't want to show up at a magic game and be laughed out

1085
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:20,000
Because I'm playing with my merfolk deck

1086
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,000
And can't remember all of the rules

1087
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:24,000
Or be ignored because I'd rather watch someone play the horror games

1088
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,000
For example Fatal Frame 2

1089
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,000
So that I can cover my eyes when it gets scary

1090
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,000
How do you suggest I go about finding

1091
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,000
These guys without running into the creepy stalkers

1092
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:34,000
On Craigslist? Do they even exist?

1093
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:36,000
Say it

1094
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:38,000
Griffin you are fucking adorable

1095
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:40,000
You can tell me how girls get your attention

1096
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,000
Sorry okay well thanks

1097
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,000
Well thank you

1098
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:46,000
This one was a confidence booster

1099
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:48,000
For me

1100
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,000
A little pep in my step

1101
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:52,000
The pep in your step kick is good too

1102
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:54,000
Yeah

1103
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,000
That one hurts really bad

1104
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,000
Whoa that has something extra

1105
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:00,000
He kicked me right in my pep

1106
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,000
Wow right in the pep

1107
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:04,000
I will say that

1108
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:06,000
In situations like this

1109
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:08,000
I don't think

1110
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,000
I don't think ladies need to use their

1111
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:12,000
Their nerd charm to try and attract

1112
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,000
Fellas because their usual old

1113
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,000
Feminine wiles will

1114
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:18,000
Serve them pretty well

1115
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,000
Yeah I think actually you're going to attract the wrong

1116
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,000
Kind of guy by being outwardly nerdy

1117
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,000
Yeah maybe that's just me

1118
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,000
Here's the thing

1119
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:28,000
The nerdy guys they already want to go out with you

1120
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:30,000
Yeah

1121
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:32,000
Because according to your email you're pretty

1122
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:34,000
And they're guys

1123
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:36,000
They're probably lonely

1124
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,000
Here's the trick though

1125
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:40,000
The trick is you've got to find the right kind of nerdy guy

1126
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:42,000
Because

1127
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:44,000
God love them you may not want to end up

1128
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:46,000
A lot of nerdy guys can be kind of socially

1129
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:48,000
Eh retarded

1130
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:50,000
And I don't mean that in the

1131
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,000
Retarded sense I mean socially retarded

1132
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:54,000
Like slow

1133
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:56,000
Inept just comically inept

1134
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,000
Look at our emails

1135
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,000
Just pick like the top 5 from the people who

1136
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,000
Email us every week and we'll send them to you

1137
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,000
No kidding

1138
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:06,000
Yeah not a joke

1139
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:08,000
I think the MBMBAM community is a good

1140
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:10,000
Place for you to cast

1141
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:12,000
Your proverbial net

1142
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:14,000
Yeah that should pan out real good

1143
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:16,000
Just go on our Facebook group and post a

1144
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:18,000
Picture of yourself and say you're looking to meet the eyes

1145
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:20,000
We don't have time to read his question

1146
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:22,000
But we got a question

1147
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,000
From a gentleman

1148
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,000
We've been debating how to pronounce his name

1149
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:28,000
Khem Lewis

1150
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,000
I think Khem

1151
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:32,000
Lewis sent us a picture after we

1152
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:34,000
We mentioned that we got a ton of questions

1153
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:36,000
From people who don't know how girls work

1154
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:38,000
And he sent us

1155
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:40,000
Pictures of himself and his girlfriend

1156
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:42,000
And he looks like a really dope

1157
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:44,000
Like a kind of guy

1158
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:46,000
Like a dude I could be best friends with

1159
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,000
Best friends

1160
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:50,000
He's got himself a cute lady friend

1161
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,000
I imagine that Khem Lewis

1162
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:54,000
Is the norm

1163
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,000
In our little family

1164
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:58,000
That we've built

1165
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:00,000
You live in that house of cards and tell me how it works out

1166
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,000
I think he's the coolest

1167
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:04,000
He's the best of us

1168
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:06,000
Don't try hitting on Khem though

1169
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:08,000
Because he's got a lady friend

1170
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:10,000
Khem's not the fan we deserve

1171
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,000
She's a cutie

1172
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:14,000
Also

1173
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:16,000
Allison

1174
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:18,000
Opposites attract

1175
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,000
Be your classy lady that hides from

1176
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,000
Horror games and shows up with her

1177
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:24,000
Merfolk deck

1178
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,000
I don't know what that means

1179
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:28,000
And you want guys

1180
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:30,000
That are attracted to you in a

1181
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:32,000
Romantic sense and not a friend sense

1182
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,000
So you don't have to appeal to their

1183
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:36,000
Nerdy side

1184
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:38,000
Appeal to their man side

1185
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:40,000
Griffin how does a girl get your attention?

1186
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:42,000
She sends me flattering

1187
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:44,000
Emails over the internet

1188
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:46,000
No she

1189
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:48,000
She goes naked day one

1190
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:50,000
No I very much fit into this

1191
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:52,000
I try to put on air

1192
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:54,000
I'm so cool but

1193
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:56,000
I fall into the group of people

1194
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:58,000
Where if a lady walks up to me and is like

1195
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:00,000
Hey I'm like I love you

1196
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:02,000
Thank you

1197
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:04,000
For giving me this chance

1198
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:06,000
I love you

1199
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:08,000
I promise that I will take this trust

1200
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:10,000
This sacred trust that you've put in me

1201
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:12,000
By saying hi

1202
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:14,000
But seriously sir do you want

1203
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:16,000
A grande or a bento?

1204
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:18,000
Do you ask everyone that?

1205
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:20,000
Let's go out

1206
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:22,000
You want to go to Starbucks?

1207
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:24,000
Damn it

1208
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:26,000
We're already at Starbucks

1209
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:28,000
I want to hear Griffin's last question

1210
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:30,000
But first I want to tell you fine

1211
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:32,000
Folks at home how you can get in touch with us

1212

NBNBAM we like that one a lot

1216
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:42,000
Because it helps promote

1217
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:44,000

Where you can find all this jazz

1227
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:04,000
Um

1228
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:06,000
The Utah Jazz

1229
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:08,000
Also thank you so much we've passed

1230
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:10,000
300 ratings on iTunes

1231
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:12,000
And we're approaching 150 reviews

1232
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:14,000
Really great

1233
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:16,000
Can we just have a solid minute

1234
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:18,000
Where we thank everyone for being so great

1235
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:20,000
Like we missed a week

1236
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:22,000
And people were hungry for it

1237
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:24,000
And I hope that this

1238
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:26,000
I hope that we can somehow in the future

1239
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:28,000
Find a way to make up for it

1240
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:30,000
But please tell somebody

1241
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:32,000
You know about the show

1242
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:34,000
Cause it

1243
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:36,000
It really does

1244
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:38,000
That's the only way we can spread

1245
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:40,000
We're not advertising or anything

1246
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:42,000
You gotta

1247
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:44,000
We're gladvertising

1248
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:46,000
The show makes you happy and then you tell people about it

1249
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:48,000
And here's what happened

1250
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:50,000
We were going to advertise and then we watched a lot of Mad Men

1251
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:52,000
And then we just ended up getting drunk

1252
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:54,000
I can't feel that world

1253
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:56,000
I can't put money in those

1254
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:58,000
Misogynist hands

1255
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:00,000
I would suggest maybe listening to us in your car

1256
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:02,000
Maybe you're doing that right now

1257
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:04,000
Look out! Just kidding

1258
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:06,000
Roll all your windows down

1259
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:08,000
And just blast it

1260
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:10,000
Yeah

1261
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:12,000
And then we'll be like hey people on the streets

1262
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:14,000
Download NBNBAM

1263
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:16,000
Hey everybody

1264
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:18,000
Look at this fresh car

1265
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:20,000
You wanna be like him?

1266
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:22,000
He knows what he's doing

1267
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:24,000
We gave him this car

1268
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:26,000
Make sure you check out our Facebook appreciation group

1269
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:28,000
Allison's gonna be on there

1270
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:30,000
Joel's gonna be on there

1271
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:32,000
Dominic's gonna be on there meeting

1272
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:34,000
Christian girls

1273
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:36,000
That's what he's into apparently

1274
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:38,000
But that's the

1275
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:40,000
That's the whole podcast

1276
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:42,000
But we wanna have something to grow on

1277
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:44,000
Something to ponder over the next week

1278
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:46,000
The ensuing week

1279
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:48,000
We promise it won't be a week until the next NBNBAM

1280
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:50,000
Next Monday

1281
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:52,000
So Griffin why don't you break us off a slice

1282
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:54,000
This one comes to us from

1283
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:56,000
Yahoo Answers user Chuck Boris

1284
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:58,000
Who asks

1285
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:00,000
How many drops of LSD

1286
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:02,000
Should I give a 4 month old to get her to stop crying

1287
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:08,000
I'm Justin McElroy

1288
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:10,000
I'm Travis McElroy

1289
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:12,000
I'm 7

1290
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:14,000
And this is my brother and me

1291
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:40,000
You will never know me

1292
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:46,000
You
