1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:30,800
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:48,080
Hello everybody, welcome to my brother, my brother-mean-advice show for the modern era.

6
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:52,800
I'm your oldest brother Justin McElroy. I'm your mentalist brother Travis McElroy.

7
00:00:52,800 --> 00:01:03,200
And I'm Bliss Delight, an intergalactic being of all-encompassing love and light.

8
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:09,760
Guys, it's good to be back in the studio after traveling through the Ethersphere,

9
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:12,640
which is a whole thing that you guys haven't even gotten to yet.

10
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:19,120
This is the second Metamorphoses, if I remember correctly.

11
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:23,360
Yeah, you know, I came back, I took a sabbatical from being Bliss Delight,

12
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:27,040
and back then I was just sort of a ball of energy which was sort of launched into space,

13
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:29,120
hadn't even, I hadn't even hit the Ethersphere yet.

14
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:33,200
And guys, let me tell you, someday humanity's gonna get there, and that'll be a good day.

15
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:35,520
What inspired this turnaround, Griffin?

16
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:40,080
I saw the, I saw the queen last night, I saw-

17
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:40,720
Queen Elizabeth?

18
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:45,200
Yes, reincarnated into Carly Rae Jepsen.

19
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:49,280
Gang, three words, shades of Liza.

20
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:50,480
Shades of Liza?

21
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:53,600
There was, there were glimpses of Liza.

22
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:56,400
God rest her soul, reincarnated into Carly Rae Jepsen.

23
00:01:56,400 --> 00:02:00,640
Okay, that's two women who are not passed away that she's reincarnated as.

24
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:01,760
She's a lot of women.

25
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:05,920
She's a future reincarnation of the undeceased Liza Minnelli.

26
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:08,000
She's every woman.

27
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,920
You know, actually I was at that concert too.

28
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:12,720
You were not?

29
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:16,080
I was, it was okay.

30
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:20,000
I mean, one time I saw Styx in concert, and let me tell you guys, they can put on a show.

31
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,920
See Travis, I'm impervious, I'm impervious to these jests.

32
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:25,280
No, I said she was good.

33
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:27,440
Bliss Delight does not recognize haters.

34
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:29,680
I'm not hating, she was fine, she was good.

35
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:30,160
Once you become an all-encompassing-

36
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:31,920
I can really see what she was going for.

37
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:35,360
Once you become an all-encompassing being of intergalactic love,

38
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:42,080
it's just like the only emotion that really, emotion, that matters to you at that point.

39
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:43,840
Once you've sailed through the cosmos-

40
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:47,200
Guys, I went to Earth Junior, the other Earth that supports-

41
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:49,040
That's only kids programming.

42
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:53,440
It supports human-like life.

43
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:58,320
I have to say, I love Earth Junior, but I'm really into Earth at night

44
00:02:58,320 --> 00:03:00,960
when they start showing old Earths.

45
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:04,880
And then there's Earth games and sports, which is just like global guts.

46
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:08,880
I went to Earth Junior just to check out their pop star scene.

47
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:13,920
Not a lot, there's not a lot going on there in that department.

48
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:17,280
Interesting planet though, they speak through taste.

49
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:18,800
What?

50
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:19,840
That's so different.

51
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:22,560
Yeah, they have a spray nozzle on their palm.

52
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:27,040
And then if they want to talk to somebody, that person has to open their mouth

53
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:29,440
and they spray their flavor into the mouth.

54
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:33,520
You know, Earth Junior would leave me to believe that they're just the next step.

55
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:37,280
After Earth comes Earth Junior.

56
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:43,360
So you're saying we're one step removed from spraying taste for talking.

57
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,880
It's actually a really effective way of getting the job done.

58
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:52,320
Unfortunately, it's not an effective mode of transmitting pop music.

59
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,360
If there was a Carly Rae Jepsen Earth Juniorite human,

60
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:01,920
but she would just spray her music into your mouth directly,

61
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:03,760
fuck, that would be great, actually.

62
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:07,360
Do you think that we would just coin them as like Tumans?

63
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:08,560
Yes, absolutely.

64
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:12,480
I was at that concert too, I wanted to tell you.

65
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:13,360
I saw Justin there.

66
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:18,800
I was there, I really liked the music.

67
00:04:19,520 --> 00:04:21,120
Wasn't as crazy about the decor.

68
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:25,120
My Bloomin' Onion was a little bit substandard.

69
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:32,800
But my steak was excellently prepared and the $5.99 added skewer of grilled shrimp

70
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:36,160
was worth all 599 pennies that I paid for it.

71
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:38,640
How were the rules, Justin?

72
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:42,800
Well, there weren't any actually there at the concert.

73
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:43,840
It was just right.

74
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:44,640
That sounds nice.

75
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:47,440
I thought it was weird when they had to pivot

76
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:52,720
and take the concert out of the Austin City Limits music hall

77
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:54,000
where it was supposed to take place.

78
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,680
And then halfway through the show, she was like,

79
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:56,560
okay, come with me.

80
00:04:56,560 --> 00:05:00,160
And then we walked the whole crowd and her leading it like a big parade

81
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:03,200
to the Outback Steakhouse that doesn't exist in Austin.

82
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:05,840
Yeah, very Andy Kaufman inspired.

83
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:09,440
They only had Austin City Limits reserved till 8 p.m.

84
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:13,920
And then it was being taken over by the White Stripes, I think.

85
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:17,440
Well, the nice thing is if you're already at the Austin City Limits,

86
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:18,720
you're pretty close to Outback

87
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:21,520
because they have to put it legally just outside the bounds of the city.

88
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:22,720
They gotta keep it weird.

89
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:24,240
Gotta keep it weird.

90
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:28,000
You know, every my brother and me is somebody,

91
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,480
my brother, my brother, first, my brother, my brother, me.

92
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:32,480
And I really hope that this is somebody's.

93
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:33,920
I hope it's Carly Rae Jepsen's first one.

94
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:36,080
She'll be like, fuck yeah, podcast all about me.

95
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:36,580
Awesome.

96
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:39,280
I wish, ZRJ, I wish.

97
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:42,880
But instead, what we do is we take questions from listeners

98
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:44,800
and we put them, did she do any covers?

99
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:46,960
No.

100
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:47,920
God, what?

101
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:48,560
No.

102
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:48,960
God.

103
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:50,240
Curious if she did covers.

104
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:52,400
No, she did emotion front to back.

105
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:54,800
But wouldn't you like to hear her do Purple Rain?

106
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:56,720
No, I wanna hear her do fucking emotion.

107
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:59,920
You fucking tell me if ZRJ walked out and was just like,

108
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:02,160
I'd like to do one that's really close to my heart

109
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:03,760
and saying fucking Purple Rain,

110
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:05,760
you wouldn't lose your goddamn mind.

111
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:06,480
It'd be pretty good.

112
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:08,640
You know what else would make me totally psyched,

113
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:11,520
totally just crazy for this?

114
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:13,440
Would be any other song off emotion.

115
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:17,600
Okay, two questions, super quick.

116
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:18,640
Was there an opener?

117
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:19,360
Yeah, there were two.

118
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:22,480
Oh, anybody good?

119
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:22,960
Prince.

120
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:29,280
There was Carly, and then also Carly Spray Jepsen,

121
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:31,520
who was the Earth 2 version of Carly Rae Jepsen.

122
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:33,520
And that was actually pretty horrifying

123
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:36,560
because our mouths don't possess like the-

124
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:38,000
Receptacles.

125
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,200
The sensors that are required to understand spray talk.

126
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:43,040
And so when she just like fucking fully,

127
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:46,160
you know, Nickelodeon Teen Choice Award,

128
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:48,080
like blasted us with Gak,

129
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:49,680
like none of us knew how to accept that.

130
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:52,320
Was it like a Gallagher show?

131
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:54,320
A lot of people left and it was a shame.

132
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:55,520
Just like a Gallagher show.

133
00:06:56,320 --> 00:06:58,720
Yeah, but they missed a good Carly Rae Jepsen concert

134
00:06:58,720 --> 00:06:59,760
is the only bad thing.

135
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:01,760
It seemed like you had pretty good seats from the photos.

136
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:02,960
Yeah, well, it's stands.

137
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:04,560
They were stands, not seats.

138
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:05,200
They were stands?

139
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:07,120
We had seats and we were like,

140
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:09,040
and I said, fuck this,

141
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:10,320
and they let me exchange the ticket

142
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:12,720
to be in the dance zone and got it.

143
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:17,040
Where in the concert did she drop Call Me Maybe?

144
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:18,480
Close to the end.

145
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:19,680
It was it?

146
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:19,920
Yeah.

147
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:21,040
I've been to the place that loses its mind?

148
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:22,880
Yeah, everybody went crazy.

149
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:23,840
But I mean, she closed with,

150
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:26,240
I really, really, really, really, really, really like you.

151
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:27,760
And I went, I mean, do you want me?

152
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:29,920
Hey gang, hey gang, can I talk to you for a second?

153
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:31,680
If you think for like a second

154
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:34,000
that even an ounce of this is ironic,

155
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,240
put yourself in a toilet and then flush it

156
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:37,360
like in the Harry Potter movies.

157
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:39,760
We are never ironic on this show.

158
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:40,880
Very rarely.

159
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:43,920
Yeah, we occasionally are,

160
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:46,160
but I work really hard to eschew irony.

161
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:48,960
Like if we talk about Meet the Deedles,

162
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:51,520
it's because it's a fucking dope movie everybody should watch.

163
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:52,480
I do want to say-

164
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:55,360
Sincere irony, that's what our brand is.

165
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:56,560
Sincere irony.

166
00:07:56,560 --> 00:08:00,560
I do want to say since living in Austin,

167
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:02,080
like the entire five years I've lived here,

168
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:04,400
I've run into maybe like two people who were like,

169
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:05,280
hey, I listen to the show.

170
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:07,520
And that's really, really neat.

171
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:09,440
Last night at the Carly Rae Jepsen concert,

172
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:12,960
I ran into maybe nine people who were like,

173
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:15,600
great job, Griffin, you're here for the big night.

174
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:17,120
And I love that all of that,

175
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:21,520
like this relationship building took place at CRJ.

176
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:22,000
It was meant to be.

177
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,120
Of course it did.

178
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:24,640
It's a better sampling of people.

179
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:24,880
Yeah.

180
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:26,240
It's a better class of human.

181
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:28,720
Can I tell you guys my favorite fan spotting moment

182
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:30,480
I've had since we started the show?

183
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:31,920
And it happened very, very recently

184
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:33,520
when Bradbury was in town,

185
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:36,480
he and I were walking into this wizard themed shop

186
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:38,320
here in Los Angeles called Whimsic Alley.

187
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:39,360
It's amazing.

188
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:40,800
But I was talking to Bradbury

189
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:43,200
and this group of people turned around and were like, Travis?

190
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:44,240
And I was like, yeah.

191
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:45,840
And they're like, we're big fans of my brother.

192
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:46,400
My brother and me.

193
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:48,800
And one of the guys looks at me and goes, Andrew Johnson.

194
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:52,240
And I thought he was introducing himself,

195
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:54,480
but actually he was chastising me

196
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:57,040
for not knowing who Andrew Johnson was.

197
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:59,120
And to just really drive it home,

198
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:00,880
I had, this was like the day

199
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:03,360
after we put out the Andrew Johnson episode

200
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:04,400
and I'd already forgotten.

201
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:05,760
And I just went, oh yeah.

202
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:08,320
And he went like the episode.

203
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:09,200
I was like, oh yeah, yeah.

204
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:11,920
I've already forgotten who Andrew Johnson is again.

205
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:12,400
Excellent.

206
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:14,560
Like I cannot hold Andrew Johnson.

207
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:16,720
He's like the silence from Doctor Who.

208
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:18,960
I can't hold Andrew Johnson in my mind.

209
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:22,800
I want to, we need to get into the advice

210
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:23,600
because we're going a little,

211
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:26,320
it's been, it's a little laborious.

212
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:27,360
People get it.

213
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:29,680
I love Carly Rae Jepsen and the two of you.

214
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:31,760
We're also there.

215
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:32,720
You were there.

216
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:35,360
But I want to mention this Facebook post that I saw

217
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:37,520
right before we started recording from Rick Steves,

218
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:40,560
the travel author and travel video man.

219
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:42,480
Justin, you know Rick Steves, right?

220
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:43,520
From Rick, I don't know.

221
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:44,640
Rick Steves Europe.

222
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:46,640
You know Rick Steves.

223
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:48,160
He's an amazing travel man.

224
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:50,960
He has one of my favorite NPR shows about traveling.

225
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:52,560
He's an amazing travel man.

226
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:54,960
He's a beautiful old soul and he travels

227
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:56,800
and he does TV shows about it.

228
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:58,400
And he did a Facebook post

229
00:09:58,400 --> 00:09:59,920
and there's a picture in the Facebook post

230
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:02,400
and it's this old, beautiful soul man.

231
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:04,560
And he's holding a wine glass

232
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:06,400
and he's sitting at a piano

233
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:09,200
and there's some Chopin sheet music at the piano.

234
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:12,000
But wait a minute, that's not wine in that wine glass.

235
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,800
It's about 30 gigantic weed nuggets

236
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:16,160
and he's holding one in his hand

237
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:17,280
and he's grinning like,

238
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:20,240
next stop, Rick Steves is going to take you

239
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:21,920
to the fucking Blaze Zone.

240
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,680
And he has a really impassioned post about,

241
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:27,840
I'm Rick Steves and if I want to get blazed

242
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:29,760
because I just went on a trip with my whole family

243
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:31,840
to the fucking black forests of Germany

244
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:33,280
to check out their hostels

245
00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:34,400
and it was a stressful trip

246
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:36,720
and now I want to come home and get fucking blazed

247
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:38,560
in my house, that's my fucking right.

248
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:39,680
I'm Rick Steves.

249
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:40,320
That's a good point.

250
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:41,680
He's got every right to go get blazed.

251
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:43,360
Oh, now look at the picture.

252
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:44,640
It's fucking dope.

253
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:46,560
Isn't that the best picture I've ever seen?

254
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:48,000
All right, let's do the show.

255
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:48,720
That's good.

256
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:49,840
Oh, you know what sets it off

257
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:51,760
is the fucking book of Chopin.

258
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:54,640
He's just sat down to play a little.

259
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:56,080
And I just, I want everyone to know,

260
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:56,880
look at this picture

261
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:58,720
and then picture the two seconds

262
00:10:58,720 --> 00:10:59,840
after the picture was taken,

263
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:02,240
he just pops a nug into his mouth and eats it.

264
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:05,120
Like popcorn.

265
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:08,080
I fuck, like I'm imagining,

266
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:10,800
what I would really enjoy is being there at this concert

267
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:13,920
just to listen to Rick Steves play Chopin beautifully

268
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:15,920
and then listen to it get progressively worse.

269
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:20,400
Hey, now here's another one for Chopin.

270
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:22,560
Plink, plonk, plink, plonk, plink.

271
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:23,120
What do you think?

272
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:25,200
This next one's my favorite Chopin song.

273
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:27,360
Hey now, you're an all star.

274
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:28,320
Get your game on.

275
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:34,240
Hold on, I'm trying to save this image to my heart.

276
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:36,640
So this is as you've almost certainly gathered.

277
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:37,840
People know what's up.

278
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:41,840
This is a Rick Steves fan cast.

279
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:44,720
Time to do the damn thing.

280
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:46,960
For years, I've always had the problem

281
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:48,960
of people assuming I don't know a lot

282
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:50,880
about common knowledge subjects

283
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:54,320
or how to do basic tasks like cook or small home repairs.

284
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:55,520
In fairness, it usually only comes

285
00:11:55,520 --> 00:11:56,800
from people who don't know me very well.

286
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:58,640
Still, I find these assumptions insulting

287
00:11:58,640 --> 00:12:00,400
and damaging to my confidence

288
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:02,640
and would like a subtle way of letting people know

289
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:04,000
that they're out of line.

290
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,320
Yeah, I know how to clean a cast iron skillet

291
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:07,600
is the name of that question asker.

292
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:08,880
Travis, how do you deal with this?

293
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:13,280
I'm a fairly capable human being.

294
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:15,120
Yeah, that's not...

295
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:19,520
I feel like this is gonna be leveraged against anybody.

296
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:20,560
I don't think it would be Travis.

297
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:24,640
I'm talking about people assuming.

298
00:12:25,280 --> 00:12:27,760
I actually saw a Twitter exchange last night

299
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:28,800
where somebody was like,

300
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:32,000
Travis wouldn't like something about Travis

301
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,160
doing construction, how badly it would turn out.

302
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:37,520
And Travis talked about how he was a carpenter,

303
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:38,880
a stage carpenter for a long time,

304
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:40,640
and he knows his way around a saw.

305
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:41,440
I don't know why...

306
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:43,840
He also said that if I touched a saw,

307
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:44,880
I would have a heart attack, which-

308
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:47,200
No, no, no, he said if you touched the table saw,

309
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:47,680
you'd die.

310
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:48,960
I'd die.

311
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:50,960
I don't know why I felt compelled to tear me down.

312
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:53,280
I do my fair share of home improvement projects.

313
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:56,080
But yeah, but I don't know.

314
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:58,960
It seems like for some reason,

315
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:01,040
people assume Travis is less capable

316
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:02,880
just because back in 2010,

317
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:05,200
he thought that the weather he saw outside his window

318
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:06,720
was the same weather all over the planet.

319
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:10,000
It's amazing how much shit like that sticks with you.

320
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:13,280
What a difference six years makes, right, gang?

321
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:13,760
Yeah.

322
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:15,040
Well, I went back to school.

323
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:17,840
Here's what I've learned.

324
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:18,640
Kindergarten.

325
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:20,320
I'm gonna tell you the truth, question asker.

326
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:22,320
Here's what you need to keep in mind.

327
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:24,880
Everybody on this planet

328
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:28,000
knows so very little off the top of their head.

329
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:31,520
Like the idea that people in this day and age

330
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:34,320
know as much as we did before we had like phones

331
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:36,480
and computers to just tell us stuff whenever.

332
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:38,720
Like people used to have to hold this shit in their head

333
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:40,960
all the time and just memorize it and know it.

334
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:43,600
So when someone does have a piece of knowledge

335
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:45,600
that they know off the top of their head,

336
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:48,400
they're so proud to whip that out

337
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:50,080
and tell you how to do the thing

338
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:53,280
that you just need to let them have that precious moment

339
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:56,240
of like, I know how to clean a cast iron skillet.

340
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:57,840
I'm gonna tell you how to do it.

341
00:13:57,840 --> 00:13:58,800
You just have to sit there

342
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:00,880
and let them feel special for a moment

343
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:02,160
and then go on about your day.

344
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:04,000
Fuck that, no way.

345
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:08,480
You're saying that he should just let them

346
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:11,520
run wild on them with their trivia?

347
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:12,240
Just for a second,

348
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:13,840
because everybody's got that thing

349
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:14,720
that they know how to do

350
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:16,720
that they're so proud that they know how to do it.

351
00:14:19,280 --> 00:14:20,480
If they're using that knowledge

352
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:22,400
to actively make you feel small

353
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:24,400
for not knowing the thing, then fuck them.

354
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:25,200
That's garbage.

355
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:26,480
Well, it is in the delivery

356
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:29,440
because if they're like, helpful hint time,

357
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:32,000
let me like Mr. Goodbody, Mr. Roger,

358
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,640
share a helpful tip with you, that's great.

359
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:36,480
If they're like, let me make you feel stupid

360
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:37,920
because I know how to do this and you don't.

361
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:39,520
Have you seen those posts of like,

362
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:41,440
it's a picture of a guy with like a beard

363
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:44,240
and it's like, if you don't know how to change a tire,

364
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:46,960
like you should shave, fuck that shit.

365
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:48,560
Like, I hate that.

366
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:50,000
But the idea of like, you know what?

367
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,160
Most people don't know how to do most things.

368
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:54,080
Like, if you think about all the things

369
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:56,160
there are to know how to do in the world,

370
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:57,360
how many of them do you know?

371
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,120
A very slight percentage.

372
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:00,080
Yeah, like three.

373
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:02,720
Rick Steves can't change a tire.

374
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:03,440
Actually, that's not true.

375
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:04,880
He travels a bunch, I bet he-

376
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:06,720
I bet that fool knows how to do most things.

377
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:08,480
I bet he's road wise, but-

378
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:13,760
I bet Rick Steves knows how to do pretty much anything.

379
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:15,680
Now, you've called him Rick Steves.

380
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:17,040
I can't help but notice.

381
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:18,480
Yeah, that's when he's blazed.

382
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:20,000
That's his blaze name?

383
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,720
Steves, his blaze name is Rick Steves.

384
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:24,800
What's your blaze name, Justin?

385
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:25,680
Justin McElroy.

386
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:29,040
I've always, I'm always blazed.

387
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:30,400
Let me tell you my secret.

388
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:31,440
I'm always blazed.

389
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:34,960
There's gonna be a weird episode of Mabim Bam in the future

390
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:37,280
where Justin's like, hi, my name is Derek,

391
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:39,680
and I'm ready to get a lot of stuff done today.

392
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:41,680
Are you ready, advice boys?

393
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:43,360
What the fuck?

394
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:44,800
No, this is me.

395
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:45,300
Yeah.

396
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:50,400
The part of this question that's kind of tripping me up

397
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:54,480
is that the person finds the assumptions

398
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:56,720
insulting and damaging to their confidence.

399
00:15:56,720 --> 00:16:01,200
Listen, you are giving your power away,

400
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:04,160
and it is completely unnecessary.

401
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:05,760
You don't have to let anybody,

402
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:08,960
people can only make you feel the way you let them

403
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:09,460
make you feel.

404
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:15,920
I think a big part of life and trying to maintain

405
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:20,960
is deciding how much you're gonna let people in

406
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:22,800
with the way that they're treating you

407
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:24,960
and how much you're gonna let that affect your mood

408
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:26,320
and your own view of yourself.

409
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:28,960
I mean, if someone assumes you don't know how to do something

410
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:31,040
and you do know how to do it

411
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:32,960
that says more about them than it does about you,

412
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:34,640
don't let that take away your own,

413
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:37,760
you know, your own confidence in yourself

414
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:38,800
because it's, I mean.

415
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:39,920
Yeah, if you can't love yourself,

416
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:41,680
how in the hell you gonna love anybody else?

417
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:42,400
Can I get an amen?

418
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:44,240
Amen, amen.

419
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:45,120
Now let the music play.

420
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:46,480
Do you guys wanna Yahoo?

421
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:46,980
Sure.

422
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:50,800
This Yahoo was sent in by Morgan Davey.

423
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:51,360
Thank you, Morgan.

424
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:53,840
It's by Yahoo Answers user Conley who asks,

425
00:16:54,640 --> 00:16:56,320
jealous of other people's boats?

426
00:16:57,520 --> 00:16:59,600
I don't have a boat or jet ski,

427
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:01,920
but I do enjoy kayaking and paddle boarding.

428
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:04,720
Whenever I go out to a lake with boats and jet skis,

429
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:06,400
all that I can think about the whole time

430
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:07,920
is how much I want one of those.

431
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:10,800
People I know have them.

432
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:12,000
It bothers me so much.

433
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,200
I am 15.

434
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:14,160
How do I get over this?

435
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:15,300
Wow.

436
00:17:16,560 --> 00:17:17,360
How do I get over this?

437
00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:19,200
Does anybody else feel like this?

438
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:20,800
That's a lot of babysitting jobs.

439
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:22,000
Okay, wait, wait, hold on.

440
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,440
To get a boat.

441
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:24,720
So that I can understand,

442
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:27,120
because he doesn't,

443
00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:28,000
or question asked,

444
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:28,880
it doesn't quite say,

445
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:32,720
are we to assume that they have a kayak

446
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:35,840
or they have some sort of non-motored boat?

447
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:40,320
I think it's possible that they have a kayak.

448
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:42,240
They have a super puffy life jacket.

449
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:44,240
Okay, but what we're gonna picture

450
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:46,320
is that they're out on a said lake

451
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:48,000
in a non-motored boat

452
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:51,680
and a jet ski or motored boat goes flying past them

453
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:53,200
and they're like, man, that's better.

454
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:54,240
If I had a jet ski,

455
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:56,800
I would make little punks like this eat wake,

456
00:17:56,800 --> 00:17:58,880
like 24 seven, right?

457
00:17:58,880 --> 00:17:59,380
Yeah.

458
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:02,560
This is, but, and I get it,

459
00:18:02,560 --> 00:18:04,480
because when you're paddling a boat

460
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:06,400
with like your human arms

461
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:09,680
and then you see like a mechanical engineering marvel

462
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:11,840
go flying past you, yeah.

463
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:13,920
It's like you are tapping into the deepest,

464
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:16,080
most primal human impulse.

465
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:18,160
It's like, ah, no more row.

466
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:19,360
No more row.

467
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:21,120
Row bad.

468
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:22,560
Motorboat, good.

469
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:24,800
It could, but it could also just be like

470
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:27,760
this 15 year old has already made up their mind

471
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:30,160
about the trajectory they want their life to take,

472
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:32,080
which is to say ocean work.

473
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:34,480
Their life, their love, their lady is the sea.

474
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:35,520
They wanna get out there

475
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:37,840
and see what's up in the deep ocean.

476
00:18:39,040 --> 00:18:40,560
And they wanna get started early.

477
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:42,240
I'm fucking into that, man.

478
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:43,680
No, listen, I get it.

479
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:45,760
And I'm not saying that there's not a beautiful time

480
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:47,440
to like paddle a canoe down a river

481
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:48,560
and you're like, I get it.

482
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:50,320
This is me, this is danger.

483
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:52,400
But listen, jet skis are made for one thing

484
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:54,320
and one thing alone, fun.

485
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:57,600
Also sweet tricks and probably ocean rescue,

486
00:18:57,600 --> 00:18:58,560
but mostly fun.

487
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:00,800
And surfer towing.

488
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:03,200
And surfer towing, but mostly fun.

489
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:05,440
And also maybe like dolphin petting.

490
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:10,400
I would argue that also that sweet stunts are fun too.

491
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:12,480
Yeah, but I mean it all falls under

492
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:13,680
saving people from the ocean,

493
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:16,480
petting dolphins and sick tricks all fall under fun.

494
00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:18,000
And carving wake.

495
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,360
Where does carving wake fit in?

496
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:20,720
That's actually work, yeah.

497
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:23,840
That's a job, to carve wake in the ocean.

498
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:24,640
Because that's what makes the waves.

499
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:26,240
So it looks sweet for astronauts?

500
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,520
Oh fuck yeah, thanks Jeremy.

501
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:31,920
But even when you're on your jet ski,

502
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:33,440
that rocket goes flying up past you.

503
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:34,560
You're like, well now I want that.

504
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:37,920
Hell yeah, look at that sweet wake he's carving out.

505
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:40,080
Oh shit, he drew Jerry Garcia.

506
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:41,280
Fuck that's dope.

507
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:42,240
Thank you so much.

508
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:43,760
God, that's awesome.

509
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:45,600
Hold on guys, hold on.

510
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:47,600
He writes down thanks Jeremy on a piece of paper

511
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:49,360
and just like blasts it out the airlock.

512
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:51,280
That'll get to him.

513
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:53,680
As Jeremy slams his Capri Sun.

514
00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:54,880
Great wake Jeremy.

515
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:56,880
I want a kid captain.

516
00:19:56,880 --> 00:20:00,480
Captain kid, the kid captain sailing the ocean.

517
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:03,920
If this kid is gonna be 15 and gonna own a boat,

518
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:05,040
he needs to fully like,

519
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:07,200
I want a full blank check kind of deal

520
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:10,400
where he's wearing like a love boat style captain's hat.

521
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:13,280
I want the jacket with the buttons on them

522
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:15,680
with anchors on the buttons,

523
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:18,720
like looking very cool, very traditional,

524
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:21,200
like very stern task master,

525
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:23,360
like captain kid, the kid captain,

526
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:25,840
15 year old out there on,

527
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:27,040
I want a big boat though.

528
00:20:27,040 --> 00:20:28,560
Like a 15 year old on a jet ski,

529
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:29,920
I would think like you little punk.

530
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:34,800
Well, if I see like a jet ski is just a motorbike for a while.

531
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:35,920
I love that what you're pitching

532
00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:38,000
is like a sequel to Little Big League,

533
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:42,400
but it's like a kid inherits his grandpa's pirate boat

534
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:44,560
and the crew's just like,

535
00:20:44,560 --> 00:20:46,240
well, we're signed on for 10 years,

536
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:47,440
so I guess we're stuck here.

537
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,040
Okay, I'm sorry.

538
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:51,040
Trademark, trademark, trademark.

539
00:20:51,040 --> 00:20:52,400
That's a great idea.

540
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:54,000
Also, he broke his arm

541
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,760
and it makes him really good at sailing.

542
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:56,320
Uh-huh.

543
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:57,520
He's the fastest sailor

544
00:20:57,520 --> 00:20:59,680
because of how quickly he can turn the wheel

545
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:00,960
which powers the boat.

546
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:04,800
He can yoink the anchor and run the jib so fast.

547
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:05,440
So good.

548
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:06,800
Funky kid jib.

549
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:08,640
Funky butt loving that's a fast jib.

550
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:11,680
Did he just say funky butt loving that's a fast jib?

551
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:14,720
Which one of the three of us...

552
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:17,920
Listen, time for another Bim Bam Superlative.

553
00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:19,200
Everybody's favorite segment.

554
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:23,520
Which one of the three of us is most likely to own boat?

555
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:26,800
And also for bonus credit, what would we name it?

556
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:29,120
I think the answer is Justin.

557
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:30,880
Correct?

558
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:32,800
Yeah, I think, well, just because like,

559
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:36,320
I think Huntington, you could probably house a boat

560
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:38,800
like a lot easier than you could.

561
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:40,560
And Justin also strikes as the type of person

562
00:21:40,560 --> 00:21:43,840
who would see boat and be like, yeah, and just get it.

563
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:46,160
I'll take a boat.

564
00:21:46,160 --> 00:21:47,440
Yeah, boat, sure.

565
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:49,360
He'd go down to the local boat show

566
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:51,360
at the Big Sandy Superstore Arena.

567
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:54,480
I just don't know that I would...

568
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:56,160
Here's my fear.

569
00:21:56,160 --> 00:21:59,520
I don't think I'd use the boat a lot.

570
00:21:59,520 --> 00:21:59,840
No.

571
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:03,120
I feel like I would spend a lot of money housing it.

572
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:06,960
It would metaphorically collect dust in your front closet.

573
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:08,800
I would not get out there very often.

574
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:11,840
I feel like I don't think it would be a good investment.

575
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:14,640
And I hear that from a lot of boat owners that like-

576
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:15,920
Or boners as I call them.

577
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:19,840
There's an old saying that the two happiest days

578
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:22,320
in your life are the day you buy your boat

579
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:24,560
and the day your first child's born.

580
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:29,360
And then after that, you sell your boat.

581
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:34,480
I thought you said the day you buy your boat

582
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:37,040
and then the day you either sell or crash your boat.

583
00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:41,440
That is actually to say that I don't think is well known enough

584
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:43,760
for me to have turned into a joke.

585
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:45,680
The joke is the two happiest days of your life

586
00:22:45,680 --> 00:22:47,680
are the day you buy your boat and the day you sell your boat,

587
00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:50,160
which I thought that was a well-known enough

588
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:54,320
that I could sort of twist it in my trademark skewed perspective.

589
00:22:54,320 --> 00:23:01,600
So you thought it was like a boat proverb that everybody-

590
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:04,560
Yeah, a boat proverb everybody knows.

591
00:23:04,560 --> 00:23:06,880
It could be you uncultured fucks just don't know it.

592
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:09,920
This is my night at the museum where they'll be like,

593
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:11,120
oh yeah, everybody knows that saying.

594
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:12,000
It's a classic.

595
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:12,880
I want to be clear here.

596
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:14,160
I did know that saying.

597
00:23:15,040 --> 00:23:16,080
Thank you, Travis.

598
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:17,360
I did know it.

599
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:19,920
Well, you guys eat at Cracker Barrel more than I do, I guess.

600
00:23:19,920 --> 00:23:20,800
That's true.

601
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:23,600
And I read a lot more New Yorker and Ziggy comics.

602
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:26,560
And you read a lot more of the novelty signs

603
00:23:26,560 --> 00:23:27,840
that they sell at Cracker Barrel.

604
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:28,720
So many of them.

605
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:30,800
Like I would say obsessively,

606
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:34,560
like sometimes I'll be there for hours just reading the signs.

607
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:37,360
Hey, listen, two words for you guys.

608
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:38,800
Jaden Smith.

609
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:43,120
Is that the name of your boat?

610
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:47,920
Get captain the captain kid Jaden Smith running his crew.

611
00:23:47,920 --> 00:23:48,880
How good would that be?

612
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:49,520
I'd be very good.

613
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:50,960
He's not so much a child anymore though.

614
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:51,760
He's kind of a big boy.

615
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:53,840
He's kind of a Jonathan lymph Nicky.

616
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:55,360
Well, he's also a bigger boy.

617
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:56,240
He actually got bone.

618
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:57,600
Haley Joel Osmond.

619
00:23:57,600 --> 00:23:58,160
Absolutely.

620
00:23:58,160 --> 00:23:59,360
Can you read another question?

621
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:00,160
Willow Smith.

622
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:02,560
I'd rather have Willow, frankly.

623
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:07,600
I am naming my boat Jaden Smith.

624
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:08,480
Yeah, absolutely.

625
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:09,280
Thank you.

626
00:24:09,280 --> 00:24:10,480
Captain by Willow Smith.

627
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:14,640
How do I ask my roommate who I never interact with

628
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:15,440
if I can get a cat?

629
00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:17,920
I don't want to get one without asking.

630
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:18,800
That'd be pretty rude.

631
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:21,520
But we're both home at the same time.

632
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:23,200
She goes and hangs in a room.

633
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:25,280
The most we say to each other is hello

634
00:24:25,280 --> 00:24:26,560
and that's how our days were.

635
00:24:26,560 --> 00:24:28,720
I really don't know how to casually bring up the topic

636
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:30,960
of a kitten in that small amount of time.

637
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:34,000
Any advice on how I should approach the topic?

638
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:35,600
That's from Gmail.

639
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:40,080
So you have currently a creature that lives in your house

640
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:42,160
that doesn't pay a lot of attention to you.

641
00:24:42,160 --> 00:24:42,560
Yeah.

642
00:24:42,560 --> 00:24:45,200
And like you walk in, they greet you and then go away.

643
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:46,160
You already own a cat.

644
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:46,800
You own a human cat.

645
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:47,920
Yeah, you have a cat.

646
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:49,520
You have a roommate cat human.

647
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:51,600
This could be a reverse Hocus Pocus situation.

648
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:52,720
Cats.

649
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:53,440
How do you mean?

650
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:54,800
You know how the human became a cat?

651
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:57,040
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

652
00:24:57,040 --> 00:24:58,240
In Hocus Pocus, the movie?

653
00:24:59,040 --> 00:25:00,800
I went and saw the witch recently.

654
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:03,520
I was sold that it was basically a spiritual sequel

655
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:04,960
to Hocus Pocus.

656
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:06,160
No, no.

657
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:07,520
It was not?

658
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:08,080
No.

659
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:09,280
First of all, was it spookier?

660
00:25:09,280 --> 00:25:10,240
No to Jimmy.

661
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:12,640
Significantly spookier, I would say.

662
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:16,000
Like on a scale of Hocus Pocus to Sabrina the Teenage Witch,

663
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:17,760
the spookiest thing I've ever seen.

664
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:18,000
Okay.

665
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:19,040
How spooky was it?

666
00:25:19,040 --> 00:25:20,880
There's a part of Hocus Pocus where Kathy and Jimmy

667
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:22,000
rides around on a vacuum cleaner.

668
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:23,680
That's funny.

669
00:25:23,680 --> 00:25:24,400
That's funny.

670
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:25,120
It is funny.

671
00:25:25,680 --> 00:25:27,600
It is funny because it's kind of a modern broom.

672
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:32,240
I don't know a problem that you solve with a cat

673
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:34,480
that you don't less depressingly solve

674
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:37,440
by getting to know your roommate a little bit better.

675
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:38,560
I just feel like-

676
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:40,080
And we're all three cat owners.

677
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:41,360
Let's be clear here.

678
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:41,920
Yeah.

679
00:25:41,920 --> 00:25:44,000
Yeah, I have two cats.

680
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,280
You have one and a half cats.

681
00:25:45,280 --> 00:25:48,640
Well, no, CJ's one and a half cat.

682
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:50,080
Yeah, CJ's one and a half cats.

683
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:51,920
And then I have a border who is a cat

684
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:54,640
that has nothing to do with me or anybody.

685
00:25:56,080 --> 00:25:59,680
She is renting and what she pays is turds.

686
00:25:59,680 --> 00:26:02,400
I guess she pays in turds.

687
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:03,520
That's currency.

688
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:05,840
Anyway, Amelia is the cat no man has touched.

689
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:07,600
Nobody's ever touched that fucking cat.

690
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:08,160
It's the worst.

691
00:26:08,160 --> 00:26:09,840
I'm not saying that this is going to work.

692
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:13,840
I'm saying you should make a go of it first with your roommate

693
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:15,440
before you buy the cat

694
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:20,080
because it works both ways.

695
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:22,480
One, you form a bond and you think like,

696
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:22,880
you know what?

697
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:24,240
I don't really need a cat right now.

698
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:26,160
I have a new sort of relationship

699
00:26:26,160 --> 00:26:27,360
that I'm trying to foster

700
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:29,520
or you become close enough to them

701
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:32,880
where you can say, listen, this isn't working for me.

702
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:34,160
I need to buy a cat.

703
00:26:34,160 --> 00:26:36,240
Or third option, you get to use the phrase,

704
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:37,200
we should get a cat.

705
00:26:37,920 --> 00:26:39,440
We should get a cat together

706
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:42,480
and use it to help our friendship develop.

707
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:43,760
We need this.

708
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:45,520
We can combine our names

709
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:47,840
and smush them together in a portmanteau

710
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:50,320
and it'll be like our cat that we share together.

711
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:51,520
You are absolutely correct though

712
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:54,240
that you should not get a cat without asking your roommate.

713
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:56,800
Well, yeah, Travis, I think that's illegal.

714
00:26:57,920 --> 00:26:59,600
You would be amazed, Griffin,

715
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:01,760
how many people I know have told me stories

716
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:03,520
about their roommate just bringing home animals

717
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:05,120
and be like, we own a dog now

718
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:07,840
or we own a cat now and be like, well, fuck.

719
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:09,280
Shit, Stephanie, I got bad news.

720
00:27:09,280 --> 00:27:11,040
I completely spaced

721
00:27:11,040 --> 00:27:13,040
and I totally forgot to tell you about this,

722
00:27:13,040 --> 00:27:14,000
but we bought a zoo.

723
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:16,960
Yeah, we bought a zoo.

724
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:18,080
You live in a zoo now.

725
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:18,960
There's lemurs and stuff.

726
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:20,400
I think it's gonna bring me and my daughter together

727
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:22,000
because her mom, you know, kicked it.

728
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:25,760
But anyway, lemurs, zebra, it's gonna be great, Deborah.

729
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:27,200
I mean, Stephanie, fuck.

730
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:28,720
I have a good way into this conversation

731
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:30,640
because I'm assuming that's the only thing

732
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:31,600
this person's asking for

733
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:32,880
since they obviously do have a way

734
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:34,720
of like getting in contact with their roommate.

735
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:36,000
They're not in the fandom zone.

736
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:36,960
Like they can reach them.

737
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:40,640
I would say to them,

738
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:42,800
hey, a quick question.

739
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:43,920
Do you have any allergies?

740
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:46,160
And then they would answer

741
00:27:46,160 --> 00:27:49,040
and you would be like, okay, cool, thank you.

742
00:27:49,040 --> 00:27:50,320
Because I was thinking about getting some milk

743
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:51,200
on the way home.

744
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:52,560
And if you're really allergic to milk,

745
00:27:53,680 --> 00:27:55,520
then I didn't wanna have it in the house.

746
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:56,400
It was gonna mess you up.

747
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:57,280
The milk's for a cat.

748
00:27:57,840 --> 00:27:58,960
And then walk out.

749
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:00,320
Well, you went in a different way

750
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:01,440
than I would have thought.

751
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:02,960
It's a little disappointing

752
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:04,000
because I was just about to comment

753
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,160
on how like disquietingly good you are

754
00:28:06,160 --> 00:28:07,760
at the back door conversation.

755
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:10,320
Well, mine was a joke,

756
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:12,640
but the initial thing is actually,

757
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:13,600
I think would be pretty good

758
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:16,080
because that makes you seem considerate.

759
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:18,480
Like, oh, thank you for asking about that.

760
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:19,120
That's really nice.

761
00:28:20,160 --> 00:28:23,680
But it's like you're opening this conversation

762
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:25,360
where you're asking for something

763
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:27,280
by a considerate act,

764
00:28:27,280 --> 00:28:29,520
which is like a really good entryway

765
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:32,240
into an awkward conversation.

766
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:35,040
Okay, here, let's try that out.

767
00:28:35,040 --> 00:28:35,840
I will be the roommate

768
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:37,600
and Justin just like throw that at me, okay?

769
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:39,200
Hey, I meant to ask you,

770
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:40,560
do you have any allergies?

771
00:28:40,560 --> 00:28:42,160
Cats, I'm definitely allergic to cats.

772
00:28:42,160 --> 00:28:43,360
Oh God, bring a cat around me.

773
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:45,760
I flood my attic,

774
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:46,880
by which I mean I sneeze

775
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:48,160
and I get stuffy and stuff.

776
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:50,800
Can you, well, oh, no problem.

777
00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:52,480
Seriously, one time I saw a video

778
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:53,760
of a cat on YouTube

779
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:55,280
and I went into anaphylactic shock.

780
00:28:57,520 --> 00:28:59,120
Good news, we're getting a skunk.

781
00:28:59,680 --> 00:29:01,200
Then you buy a black cat,

782
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:02,320
white stripe on the back,

783
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:02,560
paint it there.

784
00:29:02,560 --> 00:29:03,760
Your roommate dies.

785
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:04,880
It's fucking foolproof.

786
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:05,760
Full proof.

787
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:07,520
What if you just left your front door open

788
00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:08,880
until a cat wandered in

789
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:10,480
and then you just have to keep it?

790
00:29:11,680 --> 00:29:13,120
I can't catch this darn thing.

791
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:15,040
Yeah, fucking castle doctrine.

792
00:29:15,040 --> 00:29:17,200
I guess this is what he called sanctuary.

793
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:17,680
This is our cat now.

794
00:29:17,680 --> 00:29:19,040
I am 90% sure

795
00:29:19,040 --> 00:29:20,880
that that is what castle doctrine is.

796
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:21,680
To go to my zone.

797
00:29:21,680 --> 00:29:33,200
Meow.

798
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:34,720
I want to talk about Trunk Club.

799
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:36,480
Oh, thank God.

800
00:29:37,040 --> 00:29:38,400
I just did it.

801
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:41,760
It's my elephant appreciation society.

802
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:43,120
Your time.

803
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:44,480
I'm in the Trunk Club.

804
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:45,440
I've been admitted.

805
00:29:47,040 --> 00:29:49,440
I was sent a red letter

806
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:51,760
with a golden triangle on the front

807
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:52,960
and inside it just said,

808
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:54,720
you're in, here's the shirt.

809
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:56,560
And now I belong to the Trunk Club.

810
00:29:56,560 --> 00:29:59,840
The power I wield is mind boggling.

811
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:01,120
What's the Trunk Club, Travis?

812
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:02,000
Oh, I'm glad you asked.

813
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:03,760
Trunk Club is basically,

814
00:30:05,280 --> 00:30:07,040
you know how we have lots of questions

815
00:30:07,040 --> 00:30:08,160
about where people say like,

816
00:30:08,160 --> 00:30:09,520
I don't know what to wear.

817
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:11,600
Imagine if you had a friend

818
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:13,520
who knew what to wear

819
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:14,320
and you could say,

820
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:16,480
here's the kinds of things I go to,

821
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:18,560
here's the kinds of clothes I like to wear

822
00:30:18,560 --> 00:30:20,480
and I have no idea where to get them

823
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:21,680
or how clothes work.

824
00:30:21,680 --> 00:30:22,800
And then they came back to you

825
00:30:22,800 --> 00:30:23,280
and you're like,

826
00:30:23,280 --> 00:30:25,440
hey, here's like a thousand options

827
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:26,400
that you'll really like.

828
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:28,240
And you do in fact like all of them.

829
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:29,200
The way it works,

830
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:31,280
after you try on the stuff in your box,

831
00:30:31,280 --> 00:30:32,320
in your trunk,

832
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:33,760
then you keep the stuff that you want

833
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:34,560
and the rest of the stuff,

834
00:30:34,560 --> 00:30:35,760
you put it right back in the box

835
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:36,560
and ship it back to them.

836
00:30:36,560 --> 00:30:37,760
Like no problem,

837
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:38,400
no questions asked.

838
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:38,960
And then they charge you

839
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:39,920
for the stuff you keep.

840
00:30:39,920 --> 00:30:40,720
Trav, what do you,

841
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:42,080
do you have any items in your,

842
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:43,360
did you get your trunk yet?

843
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:44,560
Can I tell you Justin?

844
00:30:44,560 --> 00:30:45,760
Here in Los Angeles,

845
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:48,160
there is like a brick and mortar place

846
00:30:48,160 --> 00:30:50,560
that I went to and like,

847
00:30:50,560 --> 00:30:51,920
one, they had a pool table

848
00:30:51,920 --> 00:30:52,720
and an open bar.

849
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:54,480
It was like the coolest shit.

850
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:55,920
And two, Brooke said like,

851
00:30:55,920 --> 00:30:56,800
okay, what do you want?

852
00:30:56,800 --> 00:30:57,360
Okay, great.

853
00:30:57,360 --> 00:30:59,360
And came back with this rack of stuff

854
00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:01,440
and they were all club bangers.

855
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:03,440
Like, and I got a pair of jeans.

856
00:31:04,160 --> 00:31:04,800
That's the,

857
00:31:04,800 --> 00:31:05,840
it's like the first time

858
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:07,200
I've ever worn jeans.

859
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:08,320
How's that butt look?

860
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:09,280
It's so good.

861
00:31:09,280 --> 00:31:10,240
Like it's how jeans

862
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:11,440
are supposed to feel.

863
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:13,760
It's like the best feeling denim,

864
00:31:13,760 --> 00:31:14,800
the best fit I've ever had.

865
00:31:14,800 --> 00:31:15,600
Do you sleep in them?

866
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:17,520
Griffin, can I tell you something?

867
00:31:17,520 --> 00:31:18,560
No joke, I could.

868
00:31:18,560 --> 00:31:20,400
No, no, but don't, but don't.

869
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:23,280
They're so comfortable, Griffin.

870
00:31:23,280 --> 00:31:24,720
It's like I've always thought

871
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:26,320
I was wearing jeans before,

872
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:28,080
but then like I take the pill

873
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:29,520
and I realized I've just been wearing

874
00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:30,640
barbed wire pants.

875
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:33,280
I'm a big fan.

876
00:31:33,280 --> 00:31:34,000
I'm a big fan.

877
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:35,040
How can I get on board?

878
00:31:35,040 --> 00:31:37,600
You can go to trunkclub.com slash my brother

879
00:31:38,560 --> 00:31:40,640
and you'll get set up with like

880
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:42,960
your account and the recommendations

881
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:43,520
and everything.

882
00:31:43,520 --> 00:31:44,640
But the personal stylist,

883
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:45,760
like I was talking about,

884
00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:47,920
who like is a real person

885
00:31:47,920 --> 00:31:49,440
that will like really help you.

886
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:51,040
It's not like it's an AI thing

887
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:52,480
where you type in pants

888
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:54,400
and it's just like, yes, pants here.

889
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:55,680
Like it's a real ass person

890
00:31:55,680 --> 00:31:56,320
that will help you.

891
00:31:56,320 --> 00:31:57,840
It's not a subscription service.

892
00:31:57,840 --> 00:31:59,840
You only pay for the clothes that you want.

893
00:31:59,840 --> 00:32:01,840
No hidden charges, just great clothes.

894
00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:02,960
They'll style you for free

895

plus free shipping both ways.

896
00:32:05,920 --> 00:32:07,680
You only pay for the clothes you keep.

897
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:09,920
trunkclub.com slash my brother.

898
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:12,480
And listen, if you're on the fence

899
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:13,600
about any items,

900
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:14,880
just tweet us a picture.

901
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:16,080
No, we'll give you like a thumbs up

902
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:16,800
or thumbs down.

903
00:32:16,800 --> 00:32:17,680
We're not styled.

904
00:32:17,680 --> 00:32:19,520
We are absolutely not styled.

905
00:32:19,520 --> 00:32:21,760
I turn to us with these questions.

906
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:23,360
Travis is now he's in the club.

907
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:25,200
I know how pants are supposed to fit.

908
00:32:25,920 --> 00:32:26,800
I want to tell you all about

909
00:32:26,800 --> 00:32:27,680
bowl and branch.

910
00:32:27,680 --> 00:32:29,440
It's B-O-L-L and branch.

911
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:31,760
One important thing you can do

912
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:33,200
to help ensure having a good day.

913
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:35,920
That's getting the right amount of sleep.

914
00:32:35,920 --> 00:32:40,320
The night before I have been sleeping recently

915
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:42,720
a lot better thanks to bowl and branch sheets

916
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:46,400
that I have been using obsessively.

917
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:47,600
If it's time to wash these

918
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:49,440
usually I'll like circulate.

919
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:50,640
You know, you wash one

920
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:51,680
and then you put on the other one

921
00:32:51,680 --> 00:32:53,040
the clean ones that you have in the closet.

922
00:32:53,680 --> 00:32:55,840
I wash them and my bed just sits naked

923
00:32:55,840 --> 00:32:56,960
until those sheets are done

924
00:32:56,960 --> 00:32:58,400
because that's all I want to sleep on.

925
00:32:59,040 --> 00:33:00,400
They're some of the most comfortable sheets

926
00:33:00,400 --> 00:33:01,520
I've ever slept on

927
00:33:01,520 --> 00:33:03,440
and they're really nicely priced.

928
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:04,880
You're paying for quality sheets

929
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:06,240
not department store overhead.

930
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:08,000
So you get really luxurious sheets.

931
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,320
Luxurious, they're luxurious sheets

932
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:12,160
for a couple hundred bucks.

933
00:33:12,160 --> 00:33:14,880
Go to online to bowl.

934
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:18,960
That's B-O-L-L and branch.com

935
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:21,520
and they'll let you try them risk-free for 30 nights.

936
00:33:21,520 --> 00:33:23,920
There's no way you're going to want to send them back.

Band-Aids, bandages.

942
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:37,680
No, they don't have any of those things.

943
00:33:37,680 --> 00:33:39,200
Survival axes.

944
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:40,720

950
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:55,200
I want to apologize to bowl and branch

951
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:57,040
for laughing through a lot of that message.

952
00:33:57,920 --> 00:34:00,800
It's not because I find the idea of high quality sheets

953
00:34:00,800 --> 00:34:04,720
and duvet covers sent to your door particularly funny.

954
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:06,800
It's because I read ahead to this next message.

955
00:34:06,800 --> 00:34:07,920
If you want to get a message on the show

956
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:09,120
for a friend or a small business

957
00:34:09,120 --> 00:34:11,040
go to maximumfun.org.jumbotron

958
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:12,320
and we'll get you set up.

959
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:14,080
But this message is for Eric

960
00:34:14,080 --> 00:34:16,000
and it's from Big Daddy Hoffman.

961
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:18,160
And the entirety of the message is

962
00:34:18,720 --> 00:34:21,280
what is dickshoulders.biz?

963
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:24,800
And I was laughing because I clicked through to it.

964
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:26,080
Have you guys visited?

965
00:34:26,080 --> 00:34:27,040
Yes, I have.

966
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:28,640
I'm visiting it.

967
00:34:28,640 --> 00:34:29,520
I'm there.

968
00:34:31,200 --> 00:34:33,840
This is the best website in the world.

969
00:34:33,840 --> 00:34:38,080
Dickshoulders.biz is maybe the best website.

970
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:41,120
What is dickshoulders.biz?

971
00:34:41,120 --> 00:34:44,320
That's the whole message for Eric from Big Daddy Hoffman.

972
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:45,760
And now you all have to live with this.

973
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:48,080
This message is for Sarah.

974
00:34:48,080 --> 00:34:49,040
Fuck you.

975
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:49,760
From Tim.

976
00:34:50,640 --> 00:34:53,280
Dear Sarah, happy anniversary.

977
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:55,040
These last two years have been amazing

978
00:34:55,040 --> 00:34:58,080
and I feel closer to you and love you more than ever.

979
00:34:58,080 --> 00:35:01,200
I'm incredibly excited to spend the rest of my life with you.

980
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:02,080
Love, Tim.

981
00:35:02,080 --> 00:35:04,480
P.S. I know our anniversary is October 5th,

982
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:06,240
which is exactly why I had our brothers

983
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:09,360
read this on February 22nd.

984
00:35:09,360 --> 00:35:12,560
I could not have fucked it up worse.

985
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:14,240
We couldn't have fucked it up worse.

986
00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:15,040
Oofa doofa.

987
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:16,160
Yeah, we almost got it.

988
00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:18,080
This is another one of those wonderful messages

989
00:35:18,080 --> 00:35:19,760
that's almost like the equinox.

990
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:23,280
Like we almost split the uprights between the dates

991
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:24,800
across two different years.

992
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:27,200
Do you think every episode Tim would see it again

993
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:28,720
and go like, honey, just listen.

994
00:35:28,720 --> 00:35:29,520
I think you'll...

995
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:31,600
Oh, no, no, fuck, nope.

996
00:35:31,600 --> 00:35:32,100
Nevermind.

997
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:35,760
And then it got enough months away

998
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:37,520
where he was like, oh, I hope it's not now.

999
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:38,720
It's gonna be worse than this.

1000
00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:39,680
Now it's gonna be weird.

1001
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:42,000
But hey, happy anniversary, you two.

1002
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:46,400
You guys, I'm so excited to introduce to you

1003
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:49,280
my new baby, Getting Curious with Jonathan Van Ness.

1004
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:51,040
This is gonna be a really fun look

1005
00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:52,560
at things that I find curious,

1006
00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:54,400
whether it's a menstrual cup,

1007
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:55,920
it might be the Romanov family,

1008
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:58,640
it might be fracking, it could be Carly Fiorina.

1009
00:35:58,640 --> 00:35:59,360
I don't even know.

1010
00:35:59,360 --> 00:35:59,920
Who knows?

1011
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:01,440
It's gonna be whatever I think is interesting.

1012
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:03,520
I can't wait to bring it to you guys.

1013
00:36:03,520 --> 00:36:05,040
We're gonna be bringing in content experts.

1014
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:06,480
I'm gonna be learning the things.

1015
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:08,160
It's only gonna take about 30 minutes

1016
00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:10,320
for you to expand your baby brains with me

1017
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:11,600
and have a super fun time.

1018
00:36:11,600 --> 00:36:12,720
So I can't wait to see you

1019
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:14,560
on our first episode of Getting Curious.

1020
00:36:15,600 --> 00:36:17,680
Hey, it's time for a Yahoo.

1021
00:36:17,680 --> 00:36:18,000
I don't...

1022
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:18,720
Okay, fine.

1023
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:21,920
Everybody's doing Yahoo's now.

1024
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:23,200
I don't feel like it's like...

1025
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:26,560
It doesn't feel as special to me anymore.

1026
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:27,840
Yeah, but their Yahoo's are like,

1027
00:36:27,840 --> 00:36:29,520
I put Piscetti up my butt

1028
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:32,320
and I'm a penguin.

1029
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:33,840
Like, fakey fake bullshit.

1030
00:36:33,840 --> 00:36:34,560
I'm not into that.

1031
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:36,000
I'm into the real shit.

1032
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:39,200
Real shit slung to us by heroes like Level 9000,

1033
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:40,400
Yajur, Drew, Drew Davenport.

1034
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:40,960
Thank you, Drew.

1035
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:42,320
Hashtag real shit.

1036
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:43,200
Hashtag real shit.

1037
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:45,200
It's by Jamie who asks...

1038
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:48,400
I put Piscetti up my butt.

1039
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:50,960
That's what it said.

1040
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:57,200
Is Mark Hamill going to be able to do lightsaber fights

1041
00:36:57,200 --> 00:36:59,360
in the next two movies of the Star Wars?

1042
00:37:00,080 --> 00:37:03,280
I have just realized and looked on Wikipedia.

1043
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:05,120
He is 64 years old.

1044
00:37:05,120 --> 00:37:07,760
Plus, I am thinking he will fight like an old man,

1045
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:10,320
like Obi-Wan Kenobi in Episode 4, A New Hope.

1046
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:14,080
Is Mark Hamill going to be too old to do the fights?

1047
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:15,360
No.

1048
00:37:15,360 --> 00:37:17,760
Okay, first things first.

1049
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:19,280
Mark Hamill's 64 years old?

1050
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:20,560
Dude, he looks fucking great.

1051
00:37:20,560 --> 00:37:21,680
Yeah, he looks really good.

1052
00:37:21,680 --> 00:37:22,640
Looks really good.

1053
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:23,200
But does he look good enough?

1054
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:24,560
That beard is working for him.

1055
00:37:24,560 --> 00:37:27,200
But can he flip and shit?

1056
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:27,520
You know what I mean?

1057
00:37:27,520 --> 00:37:30,720
But he did it with Yoda and he was like 875.

1058
00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:35,120
We're gonna have a CGI Mark Hamill.

1059
00:37:35,120 --> 00:37:36,720
Oh my fuck, how awesome is that?

1060
00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:38,320
Or just put him in a mech suit?

1061
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:40,000
Is that a thing that happens in Star Wars?

1062
00:37:41,600 --> 00:37:43,440
I feel kind of bad for Mark Hamill

1063
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:45,040
when he found out that it was like,

1064
00:37:45,040 --> 00:37:47,360
uh, we're doing this again, huh?

1065
00:37:47,360 --> 00:37:48,480
Can't get back in it.

1066
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:50,400
Because like, I bet Mark Hamill was like,

1067
00:37:51,360 --> 00:37:52,720
if that is coming up,

1068
00:37:52,720 --> 00:37:57,120
you know that you like have to start getting carved.

1069
00:37:57,120 --> 00:37:58,880
Like you have to start getting fit.

1070
00:37:58,880 --> 00:38:00,480
How baller would that be?

1071
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:02,240
Start of episode like eight,

1072
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:03,760
he just like pulls back his throat

1073
00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:05,920
and he's fucking ripped.

1074
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:08,800
Yeah, he's as jacked as Mark Hamill was

1075
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:10,160
in the original trilogy.

1076
00:38:10,160 --> 00:38:11,120
No, more so.

1077
00:38:11,120 --> 00:38:13,600
And it's just like, we haven't seen Luke in 20 years.

1078
00:38:13,600 --> 00:38:15,760
It's just because he's been getting diesel.

1079
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:18,400
No, I'm making a joke at your two expense.

1080
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:19,600
Because I don't think there is a part

1081
00:38:19,600 --> 00:38:21,440
in the original Star Wars where he ripped off his shirt

1082
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:24,000
and he had like a 13, a glistening 13 pack.

1083
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:25,120
Not in the original edit.

1084
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:30,400
In the fucking George Lucas wacky CGI special edition.

1085
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:32,000
It was like, oh my God.

1086
00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:36,320
We take you live to Dagobah

1087
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:38,320
where I just found this image of Luke

1088
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:39,680
carrying Yoda on his back.

1089
00:38:39,680 --> 00:38:40,720
And I gotta say, boys,

1090
00:38:40,720 --> 00:38:42,240
those fish lifters are looking mighty tempted.

1091
00:38:42,240 --> 00:38:42,880
Yeah, all right.

1092
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:44,400
That's fair, that's fair, that's fair.

1093
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:44,900
Deez!

1094
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:45,940
Deez!

1095
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:48,080
Rick Deez!

1096
00:38:48,080 --> 00:38:49,280
Look at Rick Deez!

1097
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:50,640
Rick Deez.

1098
00:38:50,640 --> 00:38:52,320
Rick Deez is the wee name.

1099
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:53,440
Get me Rick Deez.

1100
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:54,560
That's taken.

1101
00:38:54,560 --> 00:38:55,280
Yeah, you know what?

1102
00:38:55,280 --> 00:38:56,880
This picture just made me realize

1103
00:38:56,880 --> 00:38:59,840
there was somebody whose face was right at Mark Hamill's butt

1104
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:01,280
with their hand up Yoda.

1105
00:39:02,160 --> 00:39:03,520
Oh my God, you're right!

1106
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:05,280
You're right!

1107
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:07,200
If Yoda is on his back,

1108
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:11,600
there's somebody with his hand basically up Mark Hamill's ass.

1109
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:13,460
Yeah.

1110
00:39:13,840 --> 00:39:15,360
Oh, that's very unpleasant.

1111
00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:18,320
That's hugely unpleasant.

1112
00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:20,000
Let's just call it like it is.

1113
00:39:20,720 --> 00:39:28,000
That fight with Sir Alec Guinness as Obi-Wan Kenobi

1114
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,400
in episode four is bullshit.

1115
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:33,920
It is two old men just touching their dicks together, basically.

1116
00:39:34,560 --> 00:39:37,200
It is the worst, most boring fight ever.

1117
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:40,960
And then that's why I was so psyched in the new trilogy

1118
00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:42,960
when they got crazy with the flips and stuff.

1119
00:39:43,600 --> 00:39:46,400
They had the horn-headed man that had the two lightsabers

1120
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:48,720
and it got crazy up in there with the flips and stuff.

1121
00:39:49,680 --> 00:39:50,640
That's what I want.

1122
00:39:50,640 --> 00:39:54,000
I don't want two old men having a cane fight.

1123
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,800
I want to see some fucking action, some dynamic action.

1124
00:39:56,800 --> 00:39:58,640
Some Diego Montoya shit.

1125
00:39:58,640 --> 00:40:01,040
But you don't want to see grumpy old men in space.

1126
00:40:01,040 --> 00:40:01,440
Right.

1127
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:02,480
But here's the thing.

1128
00:40:02,480 --> 00:40:05,120
In this day and age, famous person...

1129
00:40:05,120 --> 00:40:06,080
Yeah, that would be great.

1130
00:40:06,080 --> 00:40:07,520
I just need to say real quick.

1131
00:40:07,520 --> 00:40:10,480
I know that it's unlikely considering.

1132
00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:17,280
But if we could get and stack back for grumpy old men in space.

1133
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:18,240
CGI.

1134
00:40:18,240 --> 00:40:20,240
Just thinking about all the factors.

1135
00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:22,880
It's difficult.

1136
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:23,920
It'd be a big get.

1137
00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:25,520
I mean, it'd be a big get.

1138
00:40:25,520 --> 00:40:27,760
But I would just really like to see that film.

1139
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:28,960
If we could see that film.

1140
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:30,960
Everyone, I think, in this day and age knows that

1141
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:36,800
like a celebrity like 64 is like normal person 30.

1142
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:38,000
Like I just saw...

1143
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:39,440
Okay, saw Deadpool, right?

1144
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:40,560
Ryan Reynolds.

1145
00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:41,680
Totally ripped.

1146
00:40:41,680 --> 00:40:43,120
71 years old.

1147
00:40:43,120 --> 00:40:45,920
Think about the fact that like he looked exactly the same as he did

1148
00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:47,520
in Two Guys a Girl on a Pizza Place.

1149
00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:49,680
And that was fucking like 45 years ago.

1150
00:40:49,680 --> 00:40:50,240
Yeah.

1151
00:40:50,240 --> 00:40:55,040
And he still looks that he has not aged a moment.

1152
00:40:56,400 --> 00:40:59,040
And it's like, okay, Mark Hamill might be 64,

1153
00:40:59,040 --> 00:41:01,760
but I bet he still looks better than me.

1154
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:03,360
32 year old Travis McElroy.

1155
00:41:03,360 --> 00:41:06,160
Two Guys a Girl on a Pizza Place was like pre 9-11.

1156
00:41:06,720 --> 00:41:08,560
And that motherfucker looks the same.

1157
00:41:08,560 --> 00:41:10,880
It looks exactly the fucking same.

1158
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:14,320
Rob Lowe looks actually has aged backwards.

1159
00:41:14,320 --> 00:41:17,680
Rob Lowe is like Dorian Graying all over the place.

1160
00:41:17,680 --> 00:41:18,960
Will Smith looks great.

1161
00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:19,840
Will Smith looks great.

1162
00:41:19,840 --> 00:41:21,200
This is what I'm saying.

1163
00:41:21,200 --> 00:41:21,680
Yeah.

1164
00:41:21,680 --> 00:41:26,960
Will Smith's like his face is like a reverse cut in a tree

1165
00:41:26,960 --> 00:41:28,240
and have to count his rings.

1166
00:41:28,240 --> 00:41:31,280
You cannot tell the age of anything by Will Smith's face.

1167
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:32,720
Like try cutting it in half.

1168
00:41:32,720 --> 00:41:33,120
You can't.

1169
00:41:33,120 --> 00:41:34,880
Try cutting his face in half and counting the rings.

1170
00:41:34,880 --> 00:41:35,840
There's no rings.

1171
00:41:35,840 --> 00:41:40,320
Recently, I've been invited to two, quote, passion parties.

1172
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:43,440
If you're unaware, this is a thing where women gather around

1173
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:46,720
and examine paraphernalia of the secular variety.

1174
00:41:46,720 --> 00:41:47,280
It's where they watch-

1175
00:41:47,280 --> 00:41:48,000
Wait, no, no.

1176
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:48,720
Not secular.

1177
00:41:49,680 --> 00:41:52,720
It's where they watch Tyler Perry's The Passion TV special.

1178
00:41:53,600 --> 00:41:58,000
By my female identifying family members and their co-workers.

1179
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:00,640
And it was just as awkward as I had envisioned it.

1180
00:42:00,640 --> 00:42:01,760
Oh, you went?

1181
00:42:01,760 --> 00:42:03,440
Mistake.

1182
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:06,160
You said you had been invited, but then you went.

1183
00:42:06,160 --> 00:42:07,520
That's a whole other kettle of fish.

1184
00:42:07,520 --> 00:42:08,640
That's a horse of a different color.

1185
00:42:09,280 --> 00:42:10,720
My question to you all is this.

1186
00:42:10,720 --> 00:42:12,400
Despite the popularity of such events,

1187
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:15,360
these rituals normal for relatives to be participating in?

1188
00:42:15,360 --> 00:42:16,000
No.

1189
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:19,760
Personally, I consider myself a fairly well-adjusted individual

1190
00:42:19,760 --> 00:42:23,280
that has no issue having these conversations with my close friends.

1191
00:42:23,280 --> 00:42:26,880
Yet I'm immensely uncomfortable discussing my intimate life

1192
00:42:26,880 --> 00:42:28,800
with my family in particular.

1193
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:30,240
And due to my research into this,

1194
00:42:30,240 --> 00:42:33,200
I'm a bit concerned that I'm the weird one.

1195
00:42:33,200 --> 00:42:36,640
And that's from Much Love Moby.

1196
00:42:36,640 --> 00:42:38,480
Stand in your truth, stand in your bliss.

1197
00:42:39,360 --> 00:42:40,560
Like chase your bliss.

1198
00:42:40,560 --> 00:42:44,160
Whatever feels right, go for it.

1199
00:42:45,680 --> 00:42:48,800
I don't think there's anything wrong with these parties.

1200
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:52,800
And the family thing wears me out a little bit.

1201
00:42:52,800 --> 00:42:53,760
Like not the friend thing.

1202
00:42:53,760 --> 00:42:55,760
Like going to one of these parties is like whatever.

1203
00:42:55,760 --> 00:42:58,160
Could be a real hootenanny.

1204
00:42:58,160 --> 00:42:59,680
I don't really understand the-

1205
00:42:59,680 --> 00:43:02,080
I think the point of it is the awkwardness, right?

1206
00:43:02,080 --> 00:43:04,160
Because it's not like you're going to be doing some like

1207
00:43:04,160 --> 00:43:07,360
peer-reviewed research on different Bilbo's.

1208
00:43:07,360 --> 00:43:09,120
Like I think you can get on Extreme Restraints

1209
00:43:09,120 --> 00:43:14,560
and just look at the critical consensus on the Bilbo's

1210
00:43:14,560 --> 00:43:15,840
and their special features.

1211
00:43:15,840 --> 00:43:21,680
I don't know how much info gathering is happening at these parties.

1212
00:43:22,320 --> 00:43:25,280
But then I think about if I was in a room with my two brothers

1213
00:43:25,280 --> 00:43:26,880
and we were examining Bilbo's.

1214
00:43:26,880 --> 00:43:29,120
And God forbid my dad was there.

1215
00:43:29,120 --> 00:43:29,760
Oh no.

1216
00:43:29,760 --> 00:43:33,600
And we were scoping some Bo's, then I would probably be

1217
00:43:34,400 --> 00:43:36,080
hugely bummed out by that.

1218
00:43:36,080 --> 00:43:38,960
But like if someone were to invite me, I would be like,

1219
00:43:38,960 --> 00:43:42,400
oh man, that sounds super fun if that's your thing.

1220
00:43:42,400 --> 00:43:45,440
It's like if someone invited me to any event

1221
00:43:45,440 --> 00:43:49,280
that I don't particularly enjoy, I wouldn't go to it.

1222
00:43:50,320 --> 00:43:50,880
You know?

1223
00:43:50,880 --> 00:43:53,360
If somebody was like, come watch like soccer.

1224
00:43:53,360 --> 00:43:54,400
I'd be like, no thanks.

1225
00:43:55,040 --> 00:43:57,680
We try on this show to-

1226
00:43:57,680 --> 00:43:59,920
And it's something that we weren't great at when we started

1227
00:43:59,920 --> 00:44:00,800
and I think we all-

1228
00:44:00,800 --> 00:44:03,360
One might say that we were fucking terrible at it.

1229
00:44:03,360 --> 00:44:04,800
We were fucking terrible at it.

1230
00:44:04,800 --> 00:44:08,160
We try on this show to be as like open-minded

1231
00:44:08,160 --> 00:44:10,480
and open-hearted as possible.

1232
00:44:11,120 --> 00:44:15,440
And we try, like we work really, really hard at it.

1233
00:44:15,440 --> 00:44:19,600
But there is a part of that where at some point

1234
00:44:19,600 --> 00:44:23,520
you do run into a wall within yourself

1235
00:44:23,520 --> 00:44:26,880
where you say like, okay, this is my personal limit.

1236
00:44:26,880 --> 00:44:28,080
And that's not a failing.

1237
00:44:28,640 --> 00:44:31,280
But if someone says to me, Justin,

1238
00:44:31,280 --> 00:44:34,560
do you want to go look at plastic dicks with your Aunt Dana?

1239
00:44:34,560 --> 00:44:36,640
The answer is no, I don't.

1240
00:44:36,640 --> 00:44:37,760
I don't want to do that.

1241
00:44:37,760 --> 00:44:38,720
And I'm like allowed to say no.

1242
00:44:38,720 --> 00:44:40,480
I don't like spicy food

1243
00:44:40,480 --> 00:44:43,920
and I don't like looking at plastic dicks with my Aunt Dana.

1244
00:44:43,920 --> 00:44:46,560
Like those are two things I just know about myself.

1245
00:44:46,560 --> 00:44:48,640
Aunt Patty, that might be a hoot,

1246
00:44:48,640 --> 00:44:50,960
but I still am going to politely decline.

1247
00:44:50,960 --> 00:44:53,680
No, I don't want to look at plastic dicks with you,

1248
00:44:53,680 --> 00:44:56,800
especially not if there's going to be spicy food.

1249
00:44:56,800 --> 00:45:02,000
Please let me know what sort of canapes you're planning on.

1250
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:04,320
Those are just two things I know I don't like.

1251
00:45:04,960 --> 00:45:07,040
Flavorful spicy, that's fine.

1252
00:45:07,040 --> 00:45:10,160
But just heat for heat's sake and also plastic dicks.

1253
00:45:10,160 --> 00:45:13,440
And big metal cocks, yeah, that's fine too.

1254
00:45:13,440 --> 00:45:14,000
Definitely.

1255
00:45:14,640 --> 00:45:15,280
We're going to have some-

1256
00:45:15,280 --> 00:45:16,080
I don't mind that.

1257
00:45:16,080 --> 00:45:17,200
I have a problem with plastic

1258
00:45:17,200 --> 00:45:18,320
because it's bad for the environment.

1259
00:45:18,320 --> 00:45:21,360
Do you know how long it takes for a plastic dick to break down

1260
00:45:21,360 --> 00:45:24,000
if you like bury it in a landfill or something?

1261
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:26,080
You can't recycle plastic dicks for anything,

1262
00:45:26,080 --> 00:45:29,040
but big metal dicks, you could turn that into a park bench.

1263
00:45:29,040 --> 00:45:31,280
You could turn that into, I think, shopping bags.

1264
00:45:31,280 --> 00:45:32,400
I haven't read the literature,

1265
00:45:32,400 --> 00:45:34,240
but I know that it's a thing you could do.

1266
00:45:34,240 --> 00:45:37,040
And also please don't make the food too spicy.

1267
00:45:37,040 --> 00:45:37,600
I'll be there.

1268
00:45:37,600 --> 00:45:40,160
How long it takes for a plastic dick to break down

1269
00:45:40,160 --> 00:45:42,720
if you bury it in an anus,

1270
00:45:42,720 --> 00:45:46,320
because listen, I'm in a pretty bad way over here.

1271
00:45:46,320 --> 00:45:48,640
And if you could give me some sort of timeline.

1272
00:45:48,640 --> 00:45:52,480
But a metal dick, a big metal hog.

1273
00:45:52,480 --> 00:45:53,600
You could take like a hundred of those

1274
00:45:53,600 --> 00:45:55,280
and make the Iron Throne from Game of Thrones,

1275
00:45:55,280 --> 00:45:57,360
except crazier and way more hilarious.

1276
00:45:57,360 --> 00:45:58,560
That sounds awesome.

1277
00:45:59,600 --> 00:46:00,080
I want that.

1278
00:46:00,080 --> 00:46:00,800
That sounds awesome.

1279
00:46:00,800 --> 00:46:02,080
What if I, what if every,

1280
00:46:02,080 --> 00:46:05,120
do you guys think if I started recording the podcast

1281
00:46:06,160 --> 00:46:08,720
in the Guyron Throne, which is what I'd call it.

1282
00:46:10,240 --> 00:46:11,280
Not the iron bone.

1283
00:46:13,200 --> 00:46:13,600
Fuck.

1284
00:46:13,600 --> 00:46:14,640
The Guyron bone?

1285
00:46:14,640 --> 00:46:15,280
No, we're getting too silly.

1286
00:46:15,280 --> 00:46:15,920
That's too much.

1287
00:46:15,920 --> 00:46:19,520
Would you be able to tell the difference?

1288
00:46:19,520 --> 00:46:20,880
Just sort of in my demeanor and my attitude.

1289
00:46:20,880 --> 00:46:21,440
Yes.

1290
00:46:21,440 --> 00:46:23,360
I think that you would naturally take on

1291
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:25,920
a certain gravitas that you don't get

1292
00:46:25,920 --> 00:46:27,120
in just like an office chair.

1293
00:46:28,480 --> 00:46:28,800
Okay.

1294
00:46:28,800 --> 00:46:30,720
Justin's just linked to another image

1295
00:46:30,720 --> 00:46:32,960
and I'm assuming it exists and it does.

1296
00:46:32,960 --> 00:46:34,320
And wow, this is really good.

1297
00:46:34,320 --> 00:46:35,680
Well, hold on.

1298
00:46:39,120 --> 00:46:41,280
What we're looking at here is the crown.

1299
00:46:41,280 --> 00:46:42,800
The exact thing that I've described.

1300
00:46:42,800 --> 00:46:45,600
And, but it's sitting on it sort of lazily.

1301
00:46:45,600 --> 00:46:46,320
Yeah.

1302
00:46:46,320 --> 00:46:48,000
As if to say killed him.

1303
00:46:49,040 --> 00:46:50,080
Is a giant hog.

1304
00:46:50,080 --> 00:46:51,760
Anyway, thanks for that, Justin.

1305
00:46:51,760 --> 00:46:54,400
We've got to get a visual component of this show.

1306
00:46:54,960 --> 00:46:57,200
We've got, we've got, we've got to have some sort of.

1307
00:46:57,920 --> 00:47:02,080
Now imagine instead of Yoda on Lou's back.

1308
00:47:02,080 --> 00:47:03,280
It's a dick.

1309
00:47:03,280 --> 00:47:07,120
Listen, we haven't been closed-minded in this, right?

1310
00:47:07,120 --> 00:47:09,600
Like I think, I think shit like this

1311
00:47:09,600 --> 00:47:11,520
could be really empowering and fun.

1312
00:47:11,520 --> 00:47:12,640
But what I'm saying is like,

1313
00:47:12,640 --> 00:47:16,320
like you shouldn't feel obligated to go

1314
00:47:16,320 --> 00:47:18,320
because you don't want to seem closed-minded

1315
00:47:18,320 --> 00:47:19,440
for not wanting to go.

1316
00:47:19,440 --> 00:47:21,200
This idea that you're the weird one

1317
00:47:21,200 --> 00:47:22,720
because you don't feel comfortable doing it.

1318
00:47:22,720 --> 00:47:25,600
Like that don't, don't, that's like the worst

1319
00:47:25,600 --> 00:47:27,840
possible thing you could do.

1320
00:47:27,840 --> 00:47:30,800
Like you're actually in a, in like, in a broader sense.

1321
00:47:30,800 --> 00:47:34,160
And I, and I know that you're, you know,

1322
00:47:34,720 --> 00:47:36,720
I can tell from your question that you're trying

1323
00:47:36,720 --> 00:47:38,720
really hard to, to be sort of like progressive

1324
00:47:38,720 --> 00:47:39,600
and open-minded sexually.

1325
00:47:39,600 --> 00:47:41,120
And I'm really into that.

1326
00:47:41,120 --> 00:47:43,600
But part of that, like the biggest part of that

1327
00:47:43,600 --> 00:47:47,120
from where I sit is the lack of judgment.

1328
00:47:47,120 --> 00:47:50,080
And when you say like, am I the weird one?

1329
00:47:50,800 --> 00:47:52,320
You're judging yourself.

1330
00:47:52,320 --> 00:47:54,400
Like, because you just have a preference.

1331
00:47:54,400 --> 00:47:55,280
Like you have a limit.

1332
00:47:55,280 --> 00:47:57,120
You have a thing that you don't want.

1333
00:47:57,120 --> 00:48:01,040
That's completely like, that is 100% within your right.

1334
00:48:01,040 --> 00:48:02,960
And by saying that, that you're weird,

1335
00:48:02,960 --> 00:48:04,800
like you're, you're putting that judgment on yourself.

1336
00:48:04,800 --> 00:48:06,240
If you're not gonna apply it to other people,

1337
00:48:06,240 --> 00:48:07,520
you shouldn't apply it to you either.

1338
00:48:07,520 --> 00:48:08,720
It's just not your thing.

1339
00:48:08,720 --> 00:48:09,760
That's the thing you gotta know.

1340
00:48:09,760 --> 00:48:10,640
You gotta know yourself.

1341
00:48:10,640 --> 00:48:12,240
It's weird. Know what you're into,

1342
00:48:12,240 --> 00:48:14,560
know what your deal is, and then follow that.

1343
00:48:15,440 --> 00:48:15,940
Yep.

1344
00:48:16,560 --> 00:48:17,360
That's where I'm at.

1345
00:48:17,360 --> 00:48:19,200
I feel like this has been a weirdly,

1346
00:48:19,200 --> 00:48:21,680
you guys feel like this has been like an unusually helpful,

1347
00:48:21,680 --> 00:48:24,160
like I'm feeling very, very like I'm really,

1348
00:48:24,160 --> 00:48:26,320
I think we've really gotten help from people.

1349
00:48:26,320 --> 00:48:28,960
Well, let's take five minutes just as a palette cleanser

1350
00:48:28,960 --> 00:48:30,720
and knock out this Yahoo real quick.

1351
00:48:30,720 --> 00:48:31,360
Hell yeah.

1352
00:48:31,360 --> 00:48:32,880
From Yahoo, it was, it was sent in

1353
00:48:32,880 --> 00:48:34,480
by game recognized game, Rachel Rosen.

1354
00:48:34,480 --> 00:48:35,040
Thank you, Rachel.

1355
00:48:35,040 --> 00:48:37,360
It's by Yahoo Answers user, Camille, who asks,

1356
00:48:37,360 --> 00:48:40,880
any good nicknames to call drumming?

1357
00:48:41,600 --> 00:48:45,360
Hey, hey, I need help finding something cool

1358
00:48:45,360 --> 00:48:49,280
and preferably original to call drumming for my bios for X.

1359
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:50,500
What?

1360
00:48:50,800 --> 00:48:51,300
What?

1361
00:48:51,760 --> 00:48:52,260
What?

1362
00:48:52,400 --> 00:48:52,900
What?

1363
00:48:53,280 --> 00:48:54,640
Like for their X.

1364
00:48:55,200 --> 00:48:55,700
I don't know.

1365
00:48:57,520 --> 00:48:59,280
Something original called drumming for my bios.

1366
00:48:59,280 --> 00:49:03,520
Skin pounder, tub banger, stick thrower slash crosser.

1367
00:49:03,520 --> 00:49:04,080
Ya feel?

1368
00:49:04,640 --> 00:49:07,120
All of those could be names of dildos.

1369
00:49:07,120 --> 00:49:08,800
Stick skin pounder, yes.

1370
00:49:08,800 --> 00:49:10,320
Tub banger, absolutely.

1371
00:49:10,320 --> 00:49:11,920
Stick thrower slash crosser.

1372
00:49:12,560 --> 00:49:14,800
The least of the three, but yes, still good.

1373
00:49:14,800 --> 00:49:15,300
Ya feel?

1374
00:49:15,840 --> 00:49:16,880
Oh, I feel.

1375
00:49:17,440 --> 00:49:18,320
Anything helps.

1376
00:49:18,320 --> 00:49:20,240
So just leave anything you've been called,

1377
00:49:20,240 --> 00:49:21,440
heard or made up, please.

1378
00:49:21,440 --> 00:49:22,240
Thank you.

1379
00:49:22,240 --> 00:49:25,040
So we're supposed to believe that we exist in a world

1380
00:49:25,040 --> 00:49:27,200
in which just saying drumming isn't cool?

1381
00:49:28,800 --> 00:49:29,120
Right.

1382
00:49:29,120 --> 00:49:30,320
You need something sexy.

1383
00:49:30,320 --> 00:49:32,960
You know, like they call guitar players like shredders

1384
00:49:34,080 --> 00:49:36,000
or master splinters.

1385
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:39,040
They call bassists like strang-slippers

1386
00:49:39,040 --> 00:49:42,160
and then they call singers throat pusher.

1387
00:49:42,160 --> 00:49:45,440
Throat, throat, throat, throat notes.

1388
00:49:46,160 --> 00:49:50,720
What if, what if, what if you were just like beat punisher?

1389
00:49:50,720 --> 00:49:52,160
That sounds a little extreme for me

1390
00:49:52,160 --> 00:49:53,440
because like what if they're just like a,

1391
00:49:53,440 --> 00:49:57,760
you know, sort of a pop rock sort of outfit.

1392
00:49:57,760 --> 00:49:58,260
Nice.

1393
00:49:59,760 --> 00:50:00,720
Symbol tickler.

1394
00:50:01,760 --> 00:50:02,400
That's not bad.

1395
00:50:02,400 --> 00:50:04,080
Symbol tickler, that's pretty good.

1396
00:50:04,080 --> 00:50:04,960
I like that.

1397
00:50:04,960 --> 00:50:07,920
But I feel like pianists have like tickler like on lock.

1398
00:50:07,920 --> 00:50:09,200
Like nobody else can be a tickler.

1399
00:50:09,200 --> 00:50:10,240
They are the ticklers.

1400
00:50:10,240 --> 00:50:11,200
Master of beats.

1401
00:50:12,480 --> 00:50:14,720
That's a little wordy, I think.

1402
00:50:14,720 --> 00:50:17,680
I tend to lean towards the grandiose because I believe

1403
00:50:17,680 --> 00:50:22,640
and you know, I know that my musical feelings are strong

1404
00:50:22,640 --> 00:50:24,080
and some people don't feel this strong,

1405
00:50:24,080 --> 00:50:27,840
but I believe that the drummer is the heartbeat of the band.

1406
00:50:29,200 --> 00:50:29,600
I know.

1407
00:50:29,600 --> 00:50:31,440
I feel like the drummer sets the time.

1408
00:50:31,440 --> 00:50:33,680
Yeah, and I feel like that's important.

1409
00:50:33,680 --> 00:50:35,040
I don't know much about music,

1410
00:50:35,040 --> 00:50:37,600
but the little bit I do know, I feel very strongly about.

1411
00:50:39,280 --> 00:50:40,240
I am Spartacus.

1412
00:50:41,360 --> 00:50:42,160
I led you here.

1413
00:50:43,760 --> 00:50:46,080
Spartacus is the name of my favorite drummer

1414
00:50:46,080 --> 00:50:48,720
from the film That Thing You Do.

1415
00:50:48,720 --> 00:50:50,800
What about Bop Bop Boys?

1416
00:50:51,840 --> 00:50:52,480
One more time.

1417
00:50:54,560 --> 00:50:57,600
What about Bop Bop Boys?

1418
00:50:58,640 --> 00:50:59,520
I like it.

1419
00:51:01,760 --> 00:51:03,200
Can we just call them?

1420
00:51:03,200 --> 00:51:07,360
And if you're a woman playing, Gone Girls.

1421
00:51:08,240 --> 00:51:09,360
I like that too.

1422
00:51:09,360 --> 00:51:11,280
Except it sounds a little bit like Gone Girl.

1423
00:51:12,320 --> 00:51:15,920
That's a fucking great pun that I'd like cooked up,

1424
00:51:15,920 --> 00:51:18,800
but that's like a terrifying thing that you wouldn't want to be.

1425
00:51:19,360 --> 00:51:22,000
I'm looking forward to you identifying other puns as they come up.

1426
00:51:23,600 --> 00:51:24,560
But what I'm saying is like,

1427
00:51:24,560 --> 00:51:27,520
I don't know that anyone wants to be identified as a Gone Girl.

1428
00:51:27,520 --> 00:51:28,720
Taplads.

1429
00:51:28,720 --> 00:51:30,400
Taplads is good too.

1430
00:51:31,920 --> 00:51:32,960
Beat machines.

1431
00:51:32,960 --> 00:51:34,160
No, drum machines.

1432
00:51:34,160 --> 00:51:36,240
Okay, no, fucking stop and think about it.

1433
00:51:36,800 --> 00:51:39,920
Please think, drum machine is a thing.

1434
00:51:39,920 --> 00:51:41,920
Oh, well, here's the thing, Griffin.

1435
00:51:41,920 --> 00:51:42,880
You can think all you want to,

1436
00:51:42,880 --> 00:51:44,400
but the one thing I know about music,

1437
00:51:44,400 --> 00:51:46,560
it's not about thinking, it's about feeling, damn it.

1438
00:51:46,560 --> 00:51:49,600
Especially the drums, which is all about,

1439
00:51:49,600 --> 00:51:51,760
have you fucking seen Whiplash?

1440
00:51:51,760 --> 00:51:53,280
It's not about thinking.

1441
00:51:53,280 --> 00:51:54,720
You should just be a whiplash.

1442
00:51:54,720 --> 00:51:57,120
How about we're all just whiplashes from now on?

1443
00:51:57,120 --> 00:51:58,880
What about Conker Kings?

1444
00:51:59,760 --> 00:52:01,520
Justin's the best at this.

1445
00:52:01,520 --> 00:52:03,600
What about Cuban Pete?

1446
00:52:03,600 --> 00:52:05,680
That's not a, Travis, let's just take a backseat

1447
00:52:05,680 --> 00:52:06,720
and just let Justin go.

1448
00:52:06,720 --> 00:52:09,200
Okay, what about Bongo Bears?

1449
00:52:09,760 --> 00:52:10,240
Pretty good.

1450
00:52:11,600 --> 00:52:12,480
Give me three more.

1451
00:52:13,440 --> 00:52:15,040
Okay, Jim Bay Jim.

1452
00:52:16,400 --> 00:52:18,240
Are you, okay, nope, stop.

1453
00:52:18,240 --> 00:52:19,040
Okay.

1454
00:52:19,040 --> 00:52:22,640
Do you have a Wikipedia page open called different drums?

1455
00:52:22,640 --> 00:52:24,000
No, I'm just thinking of different-

1456
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:25,600
The different drums that there are.

1457
00:52:25,600 --> 00:52:27,440
Fuck it, boys.

1458
00:52:27,440 --> 00:52:28,400
Snare Bears.

1459
00:52:28,400 --> 00:52:30,400
Snare Bears.

1460
00:52:30,400 --> 00:52:32,320
Back in the game, on the scoreboard.

1461
00:52:32,880 --> 00:52:33,520
Bass Bass.

1462
00:52:34,320 --> 00:52:36,240
Like a what?

1463
00:52:36,240 --> 00:52:38,400
Like a bitch playing drums?

1464
00:52:38,400 --> 00:52:40,720
It's great because it also works as bass bass.

1465
00:52:40,720 --> 00:52:42,480
What about cymbal tickler?

1466
00:52:42,480 --> 00:52:43,760
You said that.

1467
00:52:43,760 --> 00:52:44,240
What?

1468
00:52:44,240 --> 00:52:46,240
What about Jim Bay Jim?

1469
00:52:46,880 --> 00:52:48,000
I like that, Griffin.

1470
00:52:48,640 --> 00:52:51,040
I'm having an episode.

1471
00:52:51,040 --> 00:52:56,560
How about Rhythm Robbie?

1472
00:52:56,560 --> 00:52:59,280
Well, that's specific.

1473
00:52:59,280 --> 00:53:03,200
I think we're naming like musical garbage pail kids for the most part.

1474
00:53:05,200 --> 00:53:06,640
Can we call it blue manning?

1475
00:53:10,400 --> 00:53:14,240
Can we call the act of hitting one thing with another thing?

1476
00:53:14,240 --> 00:53:17,440
You could be like shaping a sword with a hammer

1477
00:53:17,440 --> 00:53:19,360
and we would call that blue manning.

1478
00:53:19,360 --> 00:53:20,720
Stomp without the trash cans.

1479
00:53:21,600 --> 00:53:22,880
Or stomp with the trash cans.

1480
00:53:22,880 --> 00:53:24,640
That would also fit.

1481
00:53:25,280 --> 00:53:26,000
That's not drumming.

1482
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:26,880
That's just noise.

1483
00:53:26,880 --> 00:53:28,400
What are they doing over there?

1484
00:53:28,400 --> 00:53:29,120
Stomp.

1485
00:53:29,120 --> 00:53:30,720
Sure, I'm glad somebody's taking them to task.

1486
00:53:31,280 --> 00:53:31,920
Yeah.

1487
00:53:31,920 --> 00:53:32,800
What's up, Stomp?

1488
00:53:32,800 --> 00:53:33,520
Come at me.

1489
00:53:33,520 --> 00:53:34,800
What about drum haters?

1490
00:53:35,680 --> 00:53:37,520
What do we call people who hate drummers?

1491
00:53:37,520 --> 00:53:38,080
No, no, no.

1492
00:53:38,080 --> 00:53:40,960
Because if you think about it, what you're really doing as a drummer

1493
00:53:40,960 --> 00:53:42,960
is just like hitting drums.

1494
00:53:42,960 --> 00:53:44,000
Drum fighters.

1495
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:44,880
Drum fighters.

1496
00:53:46,560 --> 00:53:50,560
What do you do in, what do you play for Coldplay?

1497
00:53:50,560 --> 00:53:52,000
Oh, I'm the drum fighter.

1498
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:52,640
What do you mean?

1499
00:53:52,640 --> 00:53:56,320
Well, the drum, if you don't keep it, you know, beaten back,

1500
00:53:56,320 --> 00:53:58,720
will just attack and kill Chris Martin.

1501
00:53:58,720 --> 00:54:02,400
So I have to like constantly sort of keep it in its place.

1502
00:54:02,400 --> 00:54:05,600
I think it's probably the hardest to, as a drummer,

1503
00:54:05,600 --> 00:54:08,800
like it's the hardest instrument to convince people

1504
00:54:08,800 --> 00:54:11,280
that they need to be careful when they're carrying your stuff.

1505
00:54:11,280 --> 00:54:11,680
Yeah.

1506
00:54:11,680 --> 00:54:13,600
Because if they drop it, you're like, hey, hey, hey, hey.

1507
00:54:14,240 --> 00:54:15,840
And they say, well, you're, I mean,

1508
00:54:15,840 --> 00:54:17,120
you're just going to hit it later, right?

1509
00:54:18,720 --> 00:54:20,320
I'm just going to hit it with sticks later.

1510
00:54:20,320 --> 00:54:23,840
I don't see how I'm going to be in any worse, you know,

1511
00:54:23,840 --> 00:54:25,120
I don't see how that's any worse.

1512
00:54:25,120 --> 00:54:28,080
Technically, by dropping that snare down that flight of stairs,

1513
00:54:28,080 --> 00:54:29,760
I played the drums.

1514
00:54:29,760 --> 00:54:31,680
I guess I'm drumming, I guess I'm a drummer now.

1515
00:54:32,240 --> 00:54:34,400
I guess now I'm the Jimba Jim.

1516
00:54:36,080 --> 00:54:38,800
Now who's the skin pounder is what I want to know.

1517
00:54:39,520 --> 00:54:41,040
That's going to do it for us, folks.

1518
00:54:41,040 --> 00:54:45,280
Thank you so much for listening to our program.

1519
00:54:45,280 --> 00:54:46,480
We hope you had a lot of fun.

1520
00:54:47,600 --> 00:54:48,720
Super quick stuff.

1521
00:54:48,720 --> 00:54:51,520
McElroy shows, you can find a bunch of our shows there.

1522
00:54:54,400 --> 00:54:58,000
We've got, let's see, I want to try to keep these shorter.

1523
00:54:58,000 --> 00:54:59,120
Yeah, real fast.

1524
00:54:59,120 --> 00:55:02,320
We got, we got Rose Buddies is a new show

1525
00:55:02,320 --> 00:55:03,760
I do with my wife about The Bachelor.

1526
00:55:04,480 --> 00:55:06,800
I got a new video game podcast called Cool Games Inc.

1527
00:55:06,800 --> 00:55:09,360
I just started one called Interrobang with Travis and Tybee

1528
00:55:09,360 --> 00:55:11,280
where me and my friend Tybee go on rants

1529
00:55:11,280 --> 00:55:13,520
that take us through whining conversations.

1530
00:55:13,520 --> 00:55:15,280
Do one called Schmanners with my wife

1531
00:55:15,280 --> 00:55:16,960
where we talk about etiquette.

1532
00:55:16,960 --> 00:55:20,160
And we just moved trends like these over to Max Fun.

1533
00:55:20,160 --> 00:55:21,440
So that's very exciting.

1534
00:55:21,440 --> 00:55:23,280
I do a show called Sawbones with my wife.

1535
00:55:23,280 --> 00:55:24,800
It's a medical history show.

1536
00:55:24,800 --> 00:55:25,920
If you haven't listened to it,

1537
00:55:25,920 --> 00:55:28,240
our most recent episode was about heartburn

1538
00:55:28,240 --> 00:55:30,160
and like why you get heartburn.

1539
00:55:30,160 --> 00:55:32,800
How we've tried to treat it, it was very informative.

1540
00:55:32,800 --> 00:55:36,160
I thought you can find that on iTunes or McElroy shows.com.

1541
00:55:36,160 --> 00:55:36,800
They're all there.

1542
00:55:37,600 --> 00:55:39,120
I want to thank John Roderick and the Long Winters

1543
00:55:39,120 --> 00:55:39,920
for the use of our theme song

1544
00:55:39,920 --> 00:55:42,000
as a departure off the album, Putting the Days to Bed.

1545
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:43,680
You can find it on iTunes.

1546
00:55:43,680 --> 00:55:44,320
You can find it on Amazon.

1547
00:55:44,320 --> 00:55:45,680
You can find it anywhere where music's sold

1548
00:55:45,680 --> 00:55:46,880
and it's very, very good.

1549
00:55:46,880 --> 00:55:48,400
It's a terrific, terrific album.

1550
00:55:48,400 --> 00:55:49,520
And John's a good guy.

1551
00:55:49,520 --> 00:55:51,520
We also want to say thank you to Maximumfun.org

1552
00:55:51,520 --> 00:55:52,480

as well as like a ton of other shows, a lot of them ours.

1554
00:55:56,800 --> 00:55:58,160
Coming up, we got the Max Fun drive.

1555
00:55:58,160 --> 00:55:59,200
So look out for that

1556
00:55:59,840 --> 00:56:02,640

We hope you had fun.

We hope you have a very safe and happy rest of your week.

1561
00:56:09,520 --> 00:56:11,360
Griffin, do you have a final Yahoo for us to think about?

1562
00:56:11,360 --> 00:56:11,760
I sure do.

1563
00:56:11,760 --> 00:56:13,440
This one was sent in by Brooks Oglesby.

1564
00:56:13,440 --> 00:56:13,920
Thank you, Brooks.

1565
00:56:13,920 --> 00:56:15,840
It's by Yahoo Answers users.

1566
00:56:15,840 --> 00:56:16,800
Something's gone wrong.

1567
00:56:16,800 --> 00:56:17,600
Call him Dave.

1568
00:56:18,320 --> 00:56:22,800
Dave asks, did the moon exist in the 90s?

1569
00:56:22,800 --> 00:56:23,840
I hate the moon.

1570
00:56:29,840 --> 00:56:31,200
My name is Justin McElroy.

1571
00:56:31,200 --> 00:56:32,080
I'm Travis McElroy.

1572
00:56:32,080 --> 00:56:33,040
I'm Griffin McElroy.

1573
00:56:33,040 --> 00:56:34,240
This has been my brother, my brother and me.

1574
00:56:34,240 --> 00:56:35,200
Kiss your dad.

1575
00:56:35,200 --> 00:56:44,800
Square the lips.

1576
00:57:05,440 --> 00:57:07,120
We welcome a kick-ass lady guest.

1577
00:57:07,120 --> 00:57:08,880
We talk about our lives, our dreams,

1578
00:57:08,880 --> 00:57:11,200
and the terrible decisions we've made that still haunt us.

1579
00:57:11,840 --> 00:57:15,280
We've had on great comedians like Aisha Tyler and Margaret Trough,

1580
00:57:15,280 --> 00:57:17,280
plus screenwriters, doctors, authors, you know,

1581
00:57:17,280 --> 00:57:19,440
anyone who's willing to be as open as we are.

1582
00:57:19,440 --> 00:57:20,400
It's all a lot of fun.

1583
00:57:20,400 --> 00:57:21,920
That's us, Lady to Lady.

1584
00:57:21,920 --> 00:57:22,960
Can you keep a secret?

1585
00:57:22,960 --> 00:57:38,960
Neither.
