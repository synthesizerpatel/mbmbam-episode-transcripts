1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:30,800
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:54,800
Hey everybody, it's E3 time again. Heading out to sunny LA to see the latest and greatest in

6
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:59,120
video games. This is my brother, my brother, and me, the Vice Chef of the Modern Era. I'm Justin,

7
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:07,840
and the middle one's Travis and Griffin, but I want to talk to our leading video game expert to

8
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:14,160
get his predictions about what we're going to see as a big show. Travis McElroy, video games have

9
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:21,520
come a long way since Pac-Man, as I remember it. Maybe you could let us in on what we can expect

10
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:27,840
from interactive entertainment in 2014 at E3. Well, the buzz is that they're going to make

11
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:35,120
Pac-Man, but for girls. And what will the difference be? Just an ass with some

12
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:40,400
fair amount of trepidation? The Pac-Man will have female genitalia,

13
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:47,520
and it will be visible. I always assumed Pac-Man's mouth was a vagina this whole time.

14
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:53,440
Is that incorrect? No, it is correct. It'll just be more blatant. Our fastest,

15
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:59,520
most problematic episode to date. So what else can we expect from video games?

16
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:06,320
Well, do you remember the Sonic game for Dreamcast in which you could collect little animals,

17
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:08,160
and they were in your memory card? Chows.

18
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:13,040
They're going to take that, but turn it into a little standalone game.

19
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:18,560
You can feed the animals and clean up their poop and exercise them.

20
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:24,240
So like a Tamagotchi is what? Like a what? Except they will die within seconds.

21
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:29,920
They're telling us we need to wrap up our segment. Any other quick rapid fire predictions

22
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:33,440
about the big show? I think they're going to make a new Mario game.

23
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,600
That's probably- Now when you say they.

24
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:39,440
Uh-huh. Video game people. The video game people are-

25
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:41,680
The video gamesters. Jim Tendo.

26
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:51,840
Hi, my name is Jim Tendo. I've been making Mario games from my garage for the past 30 years,

27
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:55,280
and I'm not going to do a goddamn thing different. It's all I know.

28
00:02:55,280 --> 00:03:00,880
His original name wasn't Mario. It was Mark. My brother Mark, who is a plumber, yes.

29
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:08,320
I have a calendar. Each page is one year. On alternating pages, there are pictures of Mario

30
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:14,240
and Link. It helps me remember what game I'm making. Guess which year this is?

31
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:17,920
Santa Star. We don't even do Santa Star, I don't think.

32
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:23,840
And when I say they, I just mean me, Jim Tendo. Jim Tendo, I make all of the video games you play.

33
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:27,920
I want to help people. I don't like video games anymore.

34
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:30,800
Me neither. I just think they peaked.

35
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:34,800
When? Prince of Persia, the original one? Battle Toads.

36
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:38,000
Battle Toads. Quest for Glory.

37
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:43,840
I haven't played a game that has been as good as Quest for Glory since Quest for Glory.

38
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:45,760
That's goddamn true.

39
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:51,200
Yeah, that's accurate. Let's not talk about this anymore. I feel like this is excluding,

40
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:56,640
well, if not a majority of our audience, at least all the cool ones.

41
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:58,480
Yeah, video games are a huge bummer.

42
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:03,120
So let's move on to some helping. I work on a history ship. No ghosts, sorry.

43
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:08,080
Now, to be fair, Jocelyn, it does say historic ship, not a history ship.

44
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:13,120
Hup along on my history ship. We're going back to 1512.

45
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:17,040
What's up in 1512? Nothing, it sucks. Hop on the boat.

46
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:19,840
Here comes the time dock.

47
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:22,320
Oh shit, we missed the time dock.

48
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:24,880
Time to pay your fees to disembark.

49
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:26,320
We missed the time dock.

50
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:29,520
Now it's 1314. It gets worse as you go back.

51
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:35,520
Now we're going to charge you all a premium for the smallpox vaccine.

52
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:38,320
That's how they get you on history time ship.

53
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:40,720
That's how they extort you on the history ship.

54
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:44,160
I work on a historic ship. No ghosts, sorry.

55
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:44,720
Prove that.

56
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:48,320
And also that you can see and that have made their presence known.

57
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:50,560
I mean, let's qualify a little bit.

58
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:51,520
They're all around us.

59
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:54,640
I also live in one of the staterooms that you see on the ship.

60
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:57,840
I also live in one of the staterooms that used to be officer's quarters.

61
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:03,520
The deal is that I live here for free as long as I agree to be the after hours security guard.

62
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:08,480
The problem is I have a hard time kicking people off who snuck on late at night.

63
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:10,560
I'm not a naturally intimidating person.

64
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:14,960
I'm a young early twenties woman, usually very cheerful, sort of plump,

65
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:17,360
and I like nearly everyone I meet.

66
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:20,720
What are some things I can do to scare trespassers

67
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:22,560
so they'll get lost without putting up a fight?

68
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:25,200
And that's from Scarcely Scary Sailor.

69
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:30,080
Your last sentence, your last sentence is answered by your first one.

70
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:32,800
Yes. A thousand times yes.

71
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:34,640
You have to pretend a ghost.

72
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:35,760
You gotta ghost them.

73
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:37,680
You have to ghost them.

74
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:43,120
All you have to do, walk up in like an old timey dress and say like,

75
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:45,200
have you seen my child?

76
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:47,520
And they will fucking run away.

77
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:49,840
Oh, God, Travis, you just put a chill up my spine.

78
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:51,600
A ghostly chill.

79
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:52,560
DMVM chillers.

80
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:54,960
Have you seen my husband?

81
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:57,920
Oh, yeah, he'd be in the lifeboats.

82
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:00,880
Tropic chillers.

83
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:03,200
I'm cold.

84
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:06,560
I ate some bad shrimp at the buffet.

85
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:10,480
Oh no, I've had the norovirus for three days.

86
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:14,720
I don't have any fluid in my body or my bowels.

87
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:15,220
Boop.

88
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:18,240
I booped everywhere.

89
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:21,840
The border lost my trunk.

90
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:23,360
That's not ectoplasm.

91
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:26,560
It's my crushing diarrhea again.

92
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:27,840
Oh no, I've gotta go bye.

93
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:35,440
I, what if you, what if you are too good?

94
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:36,960
Is my worry.

95
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:39,360
And they stab you because they don't know how ghosts work.

96
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:40,560
And they bust you.

97
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:42,960
No, and they, no, they call the ghostbusters.

98
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:44,560
Here's my question, okay?

99
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:46,480
You're a very convincing ghost.

100
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:46,800
Yeah.

101
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:47,600
All right.

102
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:50,320
The ghostbusters show up to bust you.

103
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:55,120
You tell them, oh, sorry, I understand the confusion.

104
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:58,240
I'm a human pretending to be a ghost.

105
00:06:58,240 --> 00:06:59,680
I'm ghost catfishing.

106
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:00,640
I'm ghost fishing.

107
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:05,440
They say, ha ha ghost, oldest trick in the book.

108
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:07,200
You don't think slime are trying that shit.

109
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:08,400
We've tried this one.

110
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:11,040
We've seen this one many, many times before.

111
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:12,400
You are a ghost.

112
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:13,760
Busting makes me feel good.

113
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:14,880
Add it up.

114
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:17,600
And those proton beams.

115
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:22,160
Those, those don't just like make you twirl around.

116
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:26,560
And when, and sparks shoot off of you, those will lathe you in half.

117
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:26,880
Okay.

118
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:29,280
So we can all agree that there is a circumstance in which the

119
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:31,840
ghostbusters have accidentally murdered people.

120
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:33,600
Almost certainly.

121
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:37,680
Almost break into the bus, busting HQ late at night.

122
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:40,640
And, and Winston's jumpy.

123
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:42,400
He's like, whoa, who's that?

124
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:44,880
And then he opens his bedroom door blast.

125
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:45,520
Oops.

126
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:45,920
Oops.

127
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:46,240
Sorry.

128
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:46,720
I know.

129
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:48,560
Why would you jump on Winston?

130
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:49,920
Who is my favorite ghost buster.

131
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:50,400
Yeah.

132
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:50,640
Yeah.

133
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:51,600
Justin, you want to explain that?

134
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:52,720
Why?

135
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:55,440
I just, I thought he might be near the front door.

136
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:56,480
Makes sense.

137
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:56,880
I don't know.

138
00:07:56,880 --> 00:07:58,320
Cause he was the last ghost buster.

139
00:07:58,320 --> 00:07:58,720
So he was the last ghost buster.

140
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:00,160
Oh, so he got the shittiest bed.

141
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:03,600
Everybody else wants to be on the second floor above them

142
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:06,720
so they can use the pole, you know, and they know immediately

143
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:08,000
when they fucked up too, right?

144
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:10,240
Cause you kill, you kill the woman.

145
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:14,640
And then she's just there again, but in a different form.

146
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:17,840
Now you do need to bust that because she,

147
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:20,240
she has been murdered in a horrible manner.

148
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:23,680
And then it just goes down in the books as a preemptive busting.

149
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:23,920
Yeah.

150
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:26,160
That's a good point, Travis.

151
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:30,080
It's a causal busting, not premeditated,

152
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:33,040
not premeditated accidental causal busting.

153
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:36,240
So we hope you, you know what?

154
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:38,400
You don't need to scare people off.

155
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:39,440
Just be cool.

156
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:42,800
Listen, honest to God, I've never snuck into anything ever,

157
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:45,120
but I can imagine that if I snuck onto something

158
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:49,040
and somebody with a flashlight period were to say,

159
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:50,160
Hey, get off.

160
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:51,200
I'd be like, Oh, yep.

161
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:51,440
Yep.

162
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:51,840
Yep.

163
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:52,080
Yep.

164
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:54,400
You got cursing a lot is good too.

165
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:55,280
That one's on me.

166
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:56,400
I'm not supposed to be here.

167
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:59,600
And I recognize that I am a dork.

168
00:08:59,600 --> 00:08:59,840
Yeah.

169
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:02,880
It seems weird that people wouldn't just like leave.

170
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:03,360
I don't know.

171
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:04,640
I would be so frightened.

172
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:06,960
I hear anyone who tries to argue like, no, I'm,

173
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:08,320
I'm supposed to be here.

174
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:10,160
I'm on the list.

175
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:11,680
I'm on the historic boat list.

176
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:13,040
If you could take a look.

177
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:15,360
I just think you throw a good throaty curse at them

178
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:16,800
and they're gone.

179
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:17,840
So what's more scary?

180
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:19,360
If somebody shines a flashlight on you in a place,

181
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:21,120
you're not supposed to be, he's like, Hey, get out of here.

182
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:23,120
Or like, Hey, get the fuck out of here.

183
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:23,840
You're gone.

184
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:24,400
You've vanished.

185
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:24,880
You're out.

186
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:25,440
You're done.

187
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:27,360
I'll eat your fucking eyeballs.

188
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:29,120
I assume they hired a Frankenstein.

189
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:29,360
Yeah.

190
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:30,560
Yeah.

191
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:32,000
No noise that scary could come from you.

192
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,280
They captured, they took the history shit back in time

193
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:36,800
to when Frankenstein was.

194
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:38,080
And they captured him.

195
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:39,600
1991.

196
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:45,200
You all remember that, right?

197
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:47,440
You guys don't remember that.

198
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:49,600
You remember when Frankenstein had that hit song,

199
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:51,680
I'm too sexy for my shirt, right?

200
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:52,480
That's how you know.

201
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:54,400
That's how you know you're a child in the nineties.

202
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:56,320
You remember when Frankenstein was alive.

203
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:59,280
It's one reason to know if you were a child in the nineties,

204
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:00,960
Frankenstein killed your sister.

205
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:03,840
You want to Yahoo?

206
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:04,960
Sure.

207
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:08,640
So Yahoo was sent in by fucking who do you think drew Davenport

208
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:09,680
guys.

209
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:11,600
I can show you just have a direct pipeline.

210
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:14,000
I think we need to get drew on the show to explain like how

211
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,600
he finds these goddamn gyms.

212
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:16,560
Cause they're all gyms.

213
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:20,000
And like, I'm not saying that everybody else is bad,

214
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,080
but I mean, he's clearly running the game right now.

215
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:22,720
Spoiler alert.

216
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:25,120
He has three questions on the show.

217
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,080
I don't even need to say who sent him in anymore.

218
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:28,400
Anyway.

219
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:31,360
And remember level now you just have to say when they weren't

220
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:33,920
sent in by driven level 61.

221
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:35,600
One Yahoo shaman.

222
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:37,040
He bought the expansion.

223
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:38,800
He broke past the level cap.

224
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:39,120
Thank you.

225
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:40,640
It's a hundred to get them out.

226
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:41,280
Thank you, Drew.

227
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:45,440
It's asked by Yahoo answers user KTI who asks.

228
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:48,480
Does jail make you a man?

229
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:52,960
If it does, I'm thinking of stealing something or hurting

230
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:54,800
someone so that I can go there.

231
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:57,760
I want to get bulked up and have a strong personality.

232
00:10:57,760 --> 00:10:58,320
So does it?

233
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:00,000
So does it or not?

234
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,680
I think we should strip that.

235
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:03,600
I think we should strip the gender from this.

236
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:04,400
Yeah.

237
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:06,080
Does it make you tough?

238
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:08,000
Doesn't make you a grownup, right?

239
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:08,960
I mean, that's the question.

240
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:11,680
I guess if we're being very literal about it, does it make

241
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:12,960
you older than 18?

242
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:17,120
I think I, of course, these are not the same class of people,

243
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:20,880
but there is something to me about people who've been in a

244
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:23,520
prison or served in the military and that they've been in

245
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:25,280
something that is unknowable to me.

246
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:26,720
These are not an experience.

247
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:27,360
You hope.

248
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:32,640
I hope, right, that I have ever had, will ever have, I hope.

249
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:37,600
So that does make me see them differently.

250
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:42,560
I don't know if like grown up is the word.

251
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:45,680
But here's my thing, because I've been trying to think like

252
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:49,760
where that perception comes from.

253
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:52,160
And it's got to be just like movies and TV, because every

254
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:55,120
time I've watched like an actual documentary or a movie

255
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:57,760
every time I've watched like an actual documentary or anything

256
00:11:57,760 --> 00:12:00,400
that actually like shows real prisons and real people in the

257
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:03,840
prisons, it just seems like it makes you sad.

258
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:06,720
Yeah, you know, but like in movies, it's always like, oh,

259
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:10,320
it made them toughened them up, made their souls all leathery

260
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:13,120
and you couldn't mess with them after that because they'd been

261
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:13,840
in prison.

262
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:16,000
But really, then you watch things and it's just like, I

263
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,440
miss my family.

264
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:18,080
I don't know about that.

265
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:21,600
Like Shawshank had like maybe a few rough members in there.

266
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:25,840
But most of the dudes in Shawshank, I would say, are

267
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:26,560
pretty pillowy.

268
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:28,720
I mean, I guess that's true.

269
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:31,440
Shawshank's more about like breaking people.

270
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:35,120
It's more about, you know, like fucking Brooks and shit.

271
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:38,160
And okay, Brooks didn't come out tough.

272
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:40,800
No one at the supermarket that Brooks will work that was

273
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:41,680
like, do not do not.

274
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:44,320
Damn, don't fuck with Brooks.

275
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:46,640
He will sharpen a carrot and stab you in the eyeball.

276
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:49,920
Brooks was here, bitch.

277
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:51,120
Stab, stab, stab.

278
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:53,600
Yeah, that would be a way better movie.

279
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:57,520
Man, that movie sucks.

280
00:12:57,520 --> 00:12:58,720
Shawshank Redemption 2.

281
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:00,720
Brooks was here.

282
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:06,720
That movie could have used way more produced violence in it.

283
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:11,360
I mainly just included this question to ask if you guys

284
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:13,040
think you would do good in jail.

285
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:15,280
Because like I sometimes think about it and I think about

286
00:13:15,280 --> 00:13:16,960
putting myself in that situation.

287
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:19,520
And I think about how I would thrive on like a strategic

288
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:22,240
level and I would like make the right partnerships and

289
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:24,480
alliances with the people that I needed to to help really

290
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:25,200
help myself rain.

291
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:27,760
But then I think, oh, I'm thinking of Survivor.

292
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:31,360
Well, we just I think we have the closest thing we have to

293
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:33,920
this is middle school.

294
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:35,680
I was just about to say that.

295
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:38,320
I was just going to say, I know we talked about this last week,

296
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:39,760
but middle school is prison.

297
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:43,040
I certainly adapted to that socioeconomic structure by

298
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:45,040
graduating after three years.

299
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:46,880
Yeah, that was the way I dealt with that.

300
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:48,160
You don't upset the guards.

301
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:50,240
I went to your three years.

302
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:51,120
You get out.

303
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:53,680
I went to come back middle clink and it was not.

304
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:58,880
I look back at my time at come back and think about how much

305
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:01,680
I spent like, OK, you're like the football team.

306
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:02,880
Popular cool kids.

307
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:05,280
I want to make you laugh and make you guys not want to beat

308
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:06,160
me up.

309
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:10,240
I don't remember ever getting beat up or it wasn't just that.

310
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:11,520
It wasn't just that, was it?

311
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:15,520
It was OK, so it seems like I have to sort of fit into a group

312
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:16,080
and find a group.

313
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:18,400
Well, I'm going to take a day and think about it.

314
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:19,280
Oh, fuck it.

315
00:14:19,280 --> 00:14:20,880
All the groups are closed now.

316
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:21,920
Well, I guess I'm just.

317
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:23,520
Oh, you're all calling me Pig Boy.

318
00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:25,200
My new name is Pig Boy.

319
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:26,800
My new name is Pig Boy.

320
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:29,760
And this gentleman stole my super donut.

321
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:31,040
Oh, how fun.

322
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:32,640
No, that is that is fine.

323
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:36,960
It's my fault for taking a day to think about what the role

324
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:39,520
that I'm going to fill for the rest of my come back middle

325
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:41,760
clink career is going to be.

326
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:42,560
No, that's fine.

327
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:44,240
No, that's my fault for taking a day.

328
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:46,800
Yeah, that is that is really true.

329
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:51,600
I would constantly see people in groups or teams and think,

330
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:54,160
how did you get into that?

331
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:56,000
How did you do this?

332
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,600
Did you sign up for it?

333
00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:00,240
Was it a thing like you pay ten dollars?

334
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:02,480
Did you all get pants at the same time?

335
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:05,040
And you all looked at each other's wieners and you were

336
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:06,480
like, well, this sucks.

337
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:07,280
Should we hang out?

338
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:09,360
We're going to do our own thing here, right?

339
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:11,920
So we can watch each other's backs and not get pants.

340
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:15,280
Did one football man do like a running tackle and managed to

341
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:18,560
get all six of you in his wingspan and pinned you to the

342
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:21,360
ground and peed in your hair at the same time?

343
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:22,960
And you're just like, well, I guess we're friends now.

344
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:27,920
The only group I ever heard about and oh, my God, I'm just

345
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:29,280
remembering this story.

346
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:33,520
And in the context of the present day, it is very strange

347
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:37,760
that at one point in middle school, I had one chance to get

348
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:40,000
into a click or a group of some sort.

349
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:45,280
There was a young lady who told me about an organization that

350
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:50,400
she was involved in where they it was sort of like a youth

351
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:54,320
group, except the main activity was that they would take the

352
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:59,840
youth around to try to buy cigarettes to see if they could.

353
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:01,600
And that was going to be your click?

354
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:04,400
You were going to be part of fucking Narc Club?

355
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:08,960
No, like Narc Club apparently did like a ton of other cool

356
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:11,600
shit as I remember, like go to movies and have pizza parties.

357
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:14,160
They tried to buy cigarettes and also drank a lot of beer.

358
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:19,920
Now that I'm like thinking about it in like in retrospect,

359
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:23,280
maybe my like non-involvement with this particular club-

360
00:16:23,280 --> 00:16:25,280
With the fucking honey pot society?

361
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:28,320
We're bait kids.

362
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:30,720
Come hang out with us, Justin.

363
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:32,720
Hi, I'm the leader of this group.

364
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:35,040
I'm John Quinones and these are my bait kids.

365
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:39,200
Come on, bait kids.

366
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:42,160
To be fair, that does seem like the like first you go in and

367
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:45,440
try to buy cigarettes and then like next step you go to a

368
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:48,320
restaurant and see if you get carded and then third step

369
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:49,680
you're catching predators.

370
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:51,680
We're going to knock up.

371
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:53,680
Listen, we got a busy day of filming.

372
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:55,840
We need to get you kids all around town.

373
00:16:55,840 --> 00:16:59,760
By the third show, though, like the criminal element in that

374
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:01,200
town is calling each other like, hey, watch out.

375
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:02,000
Bait kids are out.

376
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:06,000
Don't pick up one of those bait kids.

377
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,200
Bait kids are on the prowl.

378
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:10,080
I would like a glass of wine, please.

379
00:17:10,080 --> 00:17:11,200
Yeah, right, bait kid.

380
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:12,240
Let me see your ID.

381
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:14,000
I already got the call from Hector.

382
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:17,040
You got it.

383
00:17:17,040 --> 00:17:17,680
Oh, you're right.

384
00:17:18,960 --> 00:17:19,520
You're right.

385
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:21,360
This is convincing makeup.

386
00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:24,960
Quinones will go to any length to fuck you over.

387
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:29,360
I bet you actually are 16 and you got Jack disease and you're

388
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:31,200
legally a 16 year old.

389
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:32,800
That's the only community I still go to.

390
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:33,760
Get out of here.

391
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:34,880
Get out of here, bait kid.

392
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:36,400
You wrinkly ass kid.

393
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:39,200
Wrinkly ass bait kid with your old liver spots and you're

394
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:39,600
dying.

395
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:40,240
You're dying.

396
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:41,040
And you're dying, miss.

397
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:42,480
Oh, God, you're dying now.

398
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:45,760
You're way, way before me.

399
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:47,680
Like the dude in Holy Grail.

400
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:49,200
You're really selling this bait kid.

401
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:50,160
You're turning to dust.

402
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:51,200
You're turning to dust.

403
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:52,560
You have chosen poorly.

404
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:56,960
You never know.

405
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:57,840
I'm so sorry, bait kid.

406
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:00,400
I miss you, bait kid.

407
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:03,920
I wish you were still here, bait kid.

408
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:05,760
Quinones rolls up like 15 minutes later.

409
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:06,800
Time to move to the next set.

410
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:08,400
What did you do to my bait kid?

411
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:10,880
He's ash.

412
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:17,600
He was my nephew and he had Jack disease and I loved him.

413
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:20,160
This is the fourth old ass bait kid this week.

414
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:24,320
That bait kid nephew is going to make me richer than I am.

415
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:25,600
I'm already very rich.

416
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:29,200
John Quinones.

417
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:34,320
I'm 26 and I've recently started going to college again after a dismal attempt at online

418
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:34,800
education.

419
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:40,160
I met this lovely young lady in my public speaking course that I really dug and we have

420
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:42,000
some great common footing.

421
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,400
We're about the same age with similar interests.

422
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:47,120
We both work full time and we go to school full time.

423
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:51,200
We started getting a little flirtatious during class, but then I found out her last name.

424
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:56,800
It turns out she is the niece of my stepfather's stepfather.

425
00:18:57,520 --> 00:19:08,000
Now, I'm no genealogist, but I think by marriage that makes us double step cousins once removed.

426
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:10,240
Hachi-machi, now I know it.

427
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:12,160
She knows it and the American people know it.

428
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:15,600
Pump them brakes or keep on trucking.

429
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:18,960
That's for maybe a mishap in Grand Rapids.

430
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:26,000
I can't, I can't like, is there, there's, is there any blood there?

431
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:30,080
The point, the point is not whether or not there's blood.

432
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:32,000
It, I mean, it doesn't matter, right?

433
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:32,480
Is that-

434
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:33,680
That sounds so cra-

435
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:34,080
Like I-

436
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:37,920
Justin Tyler McElroy, let me pitch this.

437
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:40,960
Is the point, here's what I'm, here's what I'm trying to get to here, guys.

438
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:45,840
You are, you are wanting to move on because you don't know if there's blood or not.

439
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:47,360
I'm saying, is that the issue?

440
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:49,760
This is the fucking Kobayashi Maru though.

441
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:55,120
Because what I'm saying is it's not the issue because the issue is you know and your family

442
00:19:55,120 --> 00:20:00,160
knows and that's the thing is like, okay, let's, let's draw a line down two, three years.

443
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:01,280
You guys really hit it off.

444
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:03,280
You get engaged, day of the wedding.

445
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:05,840
Are you on the groom's side or the bride's side?

446
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:06,240
Both.

447
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:08,720
But that's so far off.

448
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:10,880
What if it's love?

449
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:12,080
I did, this is what I'm saying.

450
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:15,280
I don't want to fall into this trap, but that's so crazy far apart.

451
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:19,520
Like, you never would have met her, you know?

452
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:20,320
Except you did.

453
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:21,680
You did though.

454
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:23,760
You did meet her though.

455
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:26,640
It wasn't even at a, it wasn't at a family gathering.

456
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:28,240
That's fair.

457
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:29,840
I guess you got points in that column.

458
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:37,120
You didn't meet her by just like nature or God or what have you brought you two together,

459
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:37,600
right?

460
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:38,880
Probably nature and God.

461
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:40,240
God wants this to happen.

462
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:42,400
God wants this to happen if that's true.

463
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:43,440
Nature wants it to happen.

464
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:45,280
Mother Gaia.

465
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:48,880
Are you, do you like each other because you are related?

466
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:55,200
Do you have a weird uncle that you both shared tender memories of before realizing that it

467
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:56,320
was the same guy?

468
00:20:56,320 --> 00:21:02,880
Well, it would be your weird uncle, her like step brother, uncle, step, it'd be your step

469
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:04,400
bruncle at that point.

470
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:06,640
It would be your funky.

471
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:09,760
It would be your funky, funky, dunkey, unkey.

472
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:12,080
My boy just got married last weekend.

473
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:13,760
Mad props to Jacob Dunkel.

474
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:15,440
I'm so, so proud of you.

475
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:16,480
What's up?

476
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:17,040
Funky uncle.

477
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:17,520
What up?

478
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:18,240
Funky uncle.

479
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:21,760
Thanks for the bachelor party invite.

480
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:22,960
You piece of trash.

481
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:24,880
Just kidding.

482
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:26,240
Human garbage.

483
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:27,760
I hope you had a good time.

484
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:28,400
All right.

485
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:31,440
Here comes another question coming right to your dome.

486
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:33,680
My girlfriend and I just moved in together.

487
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:39,840
Neither of us have lived with a significant other for a long-term period and we need advice

488
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:40,880
about finances.

489
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:45,280
What's the best way to keep track of how much we're both spending and divide it up evenly?

490
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:46,320
Some other details.

491
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:51,680
I work full-time and make a reasonable but not excessive amount of money.

492
00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:55,520
And my girlfriend is preparing to go to med school next year.

493
00:21:56,480 --> 00:22:02,400
So there's an income difference between us and that's from long-term in Louisville.

494
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:07,680
This is a great question because we have the opportunity to between the three of us

495
00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:11,280
determine, like, this is like we're talking about sitting on the same side of the table,

496
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:13,120
other side of the table, that kind of thing.

497
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:14,640
How do you guys do it?

498
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:16,480
I had to, by the way, do that.

499
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:20,880
We went to an Italian restaurant yesterday, regional I did, and we sat at like a semicircle

500
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:26,240
table and they put like all of our plates and shit together at the end of the semicircle.

501
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:29,600
It was a waking nightmare.

502
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:32,800
We were both just shuddering the entire time.

503
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:33,520
We couldn't even-

504
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:34,240
Don't touch me.

505
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:34,800
We couldn't eat.

506
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:38,160
Don't touch me, don't touch me.

507
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:39,280
What do we do?

508
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:40,320
Like, I don't-

509
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:43,920
Doesn't everybody reach a point where they just don't give a fuck about how the money's

510
00:22:43,920 --> 00:22:45,280
distributed anymore?

511
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:46,240
Is that marriage?

512
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:46,720
Because I think I-

513
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:48,080
That's absolutely right.

514
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:53,280
I think I hit that point like way before marriage where like we-

515
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:57,920
It was even before we got like a joint checking account or anything like that.

516
00:22:58,480 --> 00:22:58,800
It was just like-

517
00:22:58,800 --> 00:22:59,840
I think early on-

518
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:01,440
You do it.

519
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:06,640
Yeah, I think early on you fall into this trap of going like, well, I pay for the cable

520
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:10,480
and so you pay for the gas and I'll pay for the thing.

521
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:15,920
And eventually like after you've been together long enough, all of your money is the same

522
00:23:15,920 --> 00:23:20,000
because like you're paying for dinner or she's paying for the movie or you're paying

523
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,280
for, you know, whatever.

524
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:24,000
And eventually it's like, listen, let's not keep track.

525
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:28,000
This needs paid, you have money right now and I don't, so you pay it.

526
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:32,080
When we first got together, Teresa and I, like I wasn't making a lot of money because

527
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:34,400
I was bouncing between part-time jobs.

528
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:39,280
And so she like paid rent for like the first three or four months we were together and-

529
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:40,400
That's a lot.

530
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:44,560
Yeah, but then eventually it just kind of balanced out because then I started paying

531
00:23:44,560 --> 00:23:47,760
for groceries and started paying for, you know, stuff around the house.

532
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:52,400
And eventually it all balances out in the wash, especially if you're together for like

533
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:53,760
a long enough period of time.

534
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:56,640
Eventually it's all going to just even out to zero anyway.

535
00:23:56,640 --> 00:24:01,840
So, you know, what Teresa and I did is we went through and determined how much like

536
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:06,720
we spent on bills and rent and everything, and then opened a joint checking account.

537
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:10,400
And then we deposit enough money in it to cover all those things.

538
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:13,280
Plus a little bit more auto-debit it out every month.

539
00:24:13,280 --> 00:24:14,400
So we don't have to worry about it.

540
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:18,720
And we're both just feeding money into that account that that way.

541
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:20,080
We're just paying for it together because-

542
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:25,120
It's like rounding like, like, you know how you, if you buy something from a store in,

543
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:31,440
you know, you're round to the cents, maybe the longer you're together, there's a formula

544
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:36,800
where, you know, at first you would, you would round to like the buck, right?

545
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:38,800
This is a $64 dinner.

546
00:24:38,800 --> 00:24:41,440
We each need to pay $37 of it.

547
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:43,680
And then the longer you're together, you round-

548
00:24:43,680 --> 00:24:45,200
You get such a bad job at that.

549
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:47,040
No, that was pretty good.

550
00:24:47,040 --> 00:24:50,080
You round to the, oh no, it'd be 27, wasn't it?

551
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:52,640
Or 30, don't worry about it, it's not a big deal.

552
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:57,760
32, okay, anyway, and then the longer you're together, you know, you round to the teens.

553
00:24:57,760 --> 00:25:02,160
Like you, you spent $40 on the movie and tomorrow I'll spend $40 on dinner.

554
00:25:02,160 --> 00:25:05,520
And then after you've been together for a couple of years, then you round it like to

555
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:06,720
the thousands.

556
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:08,880
You spent a thousand on rent.

557
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:09,760
I spent nothing.

558
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:10,960
Rachel and I are up to the bills.

559
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:12,880
To the billions.

560
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:14,080
We're up to the billions, yeah.

561
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:17,760
You spent a billion on that private jet.

562
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:19,120
I don't know how much that cost.

563
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:19,680
A billion.

564
00:25:19,680 --> 00:25:21,520
That's a billion round billion.

565
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:24,560
And I bought three Bugattis for 300.

566
00:25:24,560 --> 00:25:27,040
I'm at a point where it's like, that is expensive.

567
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:28,720
It's probably a billion dollars.

568
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:30,160
Yeah, oh, a Bugatti?

569
00:25:30,160 --> 00:25:34,720
It's probably 333 repeating million dollars, I would assume.

570
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:36,800
You could probably get three of those bad boys for a clean bill.

571
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:39,040
For a Boog?

572
00:25:39,040 --> 00:25:40,080
Oh, for a Boog?

573
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:41,200
For a Boogavinsky?

574
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:45,840
Where are you guys at now as far, like, do you think that once you're married is the

575
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:49,600
time to transition to like, it doesn't matter whatsoever?

576
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:53,280
Or do you think that there's still a divide?

577
00:25:53,280 --> 00:25:58,080
Because I think once you're married, especially once you're married, it hits a point.

578
00:25:58,080 --> 00:26:02,160
And listen, if you're the type of couple that decides just to live together forever and

579
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:04,480
marriage isn't important to you, this also includes you.

580
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:07,600
Once you've made that commitment, there are people out there who do not believe in the

581
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:08,640
institution of marriage.

582
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:09,920
I'm talking to you too.

583
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:17,360
Once you hit that point, like, your survival and thriving in life becomes so intertwined

584
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:23,680
that it's like, I will also pay for the gas so that you do not stall out on the highway

585
00:26:23,680 --> 00:26:29,120
later because that would also be bad for me because our lives are intertwined so deeply.

586
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:35,360
I don't want to pay for this, but I also don't want to be married and or permanently tied

587
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:41,520
to a bag person, some sort of person out on the streets.

588
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:42,480
I can't have that.

589
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:45,040
I have to keep you financially solid to a certain extent.

590
00:26:45,040 --> 00:26:50,000
Because it's not like having a roommate if your if your wife or husband or significant

591
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,960
other can't afford to pay rent, but you can.

592
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:54,720
I'm very sorry, sweetheart.

593
00:26:58,240 --> 00:26:59,920
Time to start looking for a new roommate.

594
00:27:02,160 --> 00:27:04,080
Rachel, did you eat all those Doritos?

595
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:07,120
I thought those were my Doritos.

596
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:07,920
I labeled them.

597
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:09,760
I paid for those with my money.

598
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:10,400
We joke.

599
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:15,440
OK, I just made that goof, but like, well, I don't really give a shit about who spends

600
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:16,240
what on what.

601
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:20,560
If Rachel ate my goddamn Doritos, I would probably be pretty upset about that because

602
00:27:20,560 --> 00:27:22,560
it's clearly not for I mean, they're Doritos.

603
00:27:22,560 --> 00:27:24,000
She doesn't typically eat those.

604
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,400
I bought those because I knew she didn't eat them.

605
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:29,760
And I got excited about Domitos is what they were.

606
00:27:31,280 --> 00:27:32,160
Fomitos.

607
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:37,120
They were they were Yoritos in the Spanish sense.

608
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:46,160
I I don't think there's a time when I feel more like a fat person than when I eat food

609
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:53,680
that I did not realize was not communal marriage food, but rather my wife's food, her food.

610
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:56,480
And I ate it and I didn't know.

611
00:27:56,480 --> 00:27:58,480
And then I realized, I mean, you did.

612
00:27:58,480 --> 00:27:59,920
You did know.

613
00:27:59,920 --> 00:28:00,560
Hold on.

614
00:28:00,560 --> 00:28:02,400
How often does that happen?

615
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:05,680
Like if it's like, OK, a good example is leftovers.

616
00:28:05,680 --> 00:28:08,880
We're not super good at like leftover consumption.

617
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:13,520
So sometimes I'll eat her leftovers and she and I don't realize like I think I'm being

618
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:15,120
a good boy, right?

619
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:15,920
Justin's good.

620
00:28:15,920 --> 00:28:17,120
You're cleaning out the fridge.

621
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:20,240
Clean out the fridge and put it in my belly fridge.

622
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:22,800
We've talked we talked about this like three episodes ago.

623
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:24,960
OK, I think we had different positions on it.

624
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:26,560
So I guess we're still evolving as people.

625
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:28,080
We grow.

626
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:28,880
We grow people.

627
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:29,440
We change.

628
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:31,040
We're growing.

629
00:28:31,040 --> 00:28:32,160
Let's go to the money zone.

630
00:28:32,160 --> 00:28:33,360
Hey, that's a pretty good intro.

631
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:36,720
OK, and a fart noise for color.

632
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:38,400
How about this?

633
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:41,680
Might I invite you to the money zone?

634
00:28:41,680 --> 00:28:42,320
That's way better.

635
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:43,280
You sound like a warlock.

636
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,960
And you can't see me, but I did the full arm wave and turn.

637
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:47,440
I heard it.

638
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,000
OK, I just want to make sure my blocking was clear.

639
00:28:50,000 --> 00:29:09,200
I can't see so good because I'm getting old and I've been hesitant about going to the store,

640
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:12,560
you know, because I don't I don't want to let that because it's the most humiliating

641
00:29:12,560 --> 00:29:14,480
fucking thing ever trying on glasses.

642
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:19,520
Yeah, and the paps are outside waiting to snap a few pics of me in my glasses and then

643
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:21,200
it'll be all over the gossip rags.

644
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:23,440
Griffin, you wear the glasses.

645
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:27,680
The last time you were in a glasses store trying them on, do you not feel like just

646
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:31,120
the the stupid I put them all on looking yourself in the mirror,

647
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:36,160
as you greening on your face and making like I like the you know how we all do like a smile

648
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:40,480
in the mirror that you do that you like practice your smile.

649
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:45,440
So you look less like a creep and more like Sean from Boy Meets World.

650
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:47,440
Let me just mention real quick.

651
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:49,280
This is an advertisement for Warby Park.

652
00:29:49,280 --> 00:29:52,800
No, we're going to get to the advertising, but I'm saying I want them to feel like they're

653
00:29:52,800 --> 00:29:53,840
getting their money's worth.

654
00:29:53,840 --> 00:29:56,160
I go to this is part of your ad Warby Park.

655
00:29:56,160 --> 00:29:59,520
I went to the glasses store and I had to like put on each pair of glasses and do that.

656
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:00,720
Sean from Boy Meets World smile.

657
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:03,440
It made me look like the biggest fucking creep.

658
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:06,240
I went the last time I went and bought another vignette.

659
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:06,880
Fantastic.

660
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:12,720
My wife was not with me.

661
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:16,880
And the number of times I put on glasses and looked at the employees of the store and said,

662
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:17,760
does this look good?

663
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:20,880
Like I was the most helpless human being.

664
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:23,120
Like I clearly can't gauge my own appearance.

665
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:26,560
You don't have to live like Travis Seymour because there's Warby Parker.

666
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:28,880
Glasses shouldn't cost as much as an iPhone.

667
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:34,640
They've got fashionable, fashionable frames starting at ninety five dollars.

668
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:35,280
Not just frames.

669
00:30:35,280 --> 00:30:38,320
I should mention they include the lenses too.

670
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:41,840
That's an amazing deal for anyone who's ever bought in a store.

671
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:44,240
Ninety five dollars for frames and lenses.

672
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:45,040
It's fantastic.

673
00:30:45,040 --> 00:30:49,120
I mean, what they do is they've got a home try on program.

674
00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:52,400
You can get five pairs of glasses and they're going to ship them to you.

675
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:56,880
You pick the ones you like and you ship the rest back.

676
00:30:56,880 --> 00:30:57,840
There's no obligation.

677
00:30:57,840 --> 00:30:59,360
It's free to ship them.

678
00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:01,600
It's it is not not even a big deal.

679
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:07,280
The only problem is that all the glasses come to your door and they're covered in caramel.

680
00:31:09,280 --> 00:31:10,560
It's not accurate.

681
00:31:10,560 --> 00:31:11,760
You have to clean all the caramel off.

682
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:13,440
You can put them on your face.

683
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:18,720
Well, they got them secondhand from that store that got washed over with that wave of caramel.

684
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:20,800
That's what they sell them to you at discount prices.

685
00:31:20,800 --> 00:31:24,400
Yeah, Warby Parker dot com slash my brother.

686
00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:24,720
They don't.

687
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:26,400
The caramel thing wasn't true.

688
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:27,600
It is basically true.

689
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:27,920
But here.

690
00:31:27,920 --> 00:31:29,840
Wait, before we move on, here's something that is true.

691
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:32,320
That's very awesome for every pair of glasses sold.

692
00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:34,800
They distribute a pair of glasses to someone in need.

693
00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:38,320
So you're buying glasses for yourself and helping someone out at the same time.

694
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:41,280
In need of in need of caramel thing that they don't

695
00:31:41,280 --> 00:31:43,600
check to see if the prescription matches.

696
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:46,320
No, so they just hand them out and people go, I don't need glasses.

697
00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:47,040
Like, you're welcome.

698
00:31:47,040 --> 00:31:47,440
Shut up.

699
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:48,400
You look like Rivers Cuomo.

700
00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:49,120
You look awesome.

701
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:49,920
Shut up.

702
00:31:49,920 --> 00:31:51,120
Except for this caramel.

703
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:55,440
You look like if Rivers Cuomo is somehow coated in like caramelized.

704
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:57,120
You're like you're like the sticky face.

705
00:31:57,120 --> 00:31:59,040
Rivers Cuomo, the developing world.

706
00:31:59,040 --> 00:32:00,560
Now wear your sunglasses.

707
00:32:00,560 --> 00:32:02,080
Rivers of caramel Cuomo.

708
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:08,560
If you go to Warby Parker dot com slash my brother, you're going to get free three day shipping.

709
00:32:08,560 --> 00:32:09,840
So that's really nice.

710
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:13,520
And you should go, you know, check it totally out.

711
00:32:13,520 --> 00:32:15,920
Warby Parker dot com slash my brother.

712
00:32:15,920 --> 00:32:16,640
Go now.

713
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:18,160
Go, go, go.

714
00:32:18,160 --> 00:32:18,880
Do it.

715
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:23,120
Speaking of caramel, let's talk about nature box.

716
00:32:23,920 --> 00:32:25,040
Friend of the show.

717
00:32:25,040 --> 00:32:26,160
I think they're so excited.

718
00:32:26,160 --> 00:32:27,440
We've had a number of people.

719
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:29,520
Yeah, I'm finally trying it.

720
00:32:29,520 --> 00:32:30,320
And that's exciting.

721
00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:31,440
But at the same time, I want to go.

722
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:32,000
What do you mean?

723
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,400
Finally, we've been talking about what took you so long.

724
00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:35,440
Six months.

725
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:38,960
What is it we said we said to you?

726
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:39,920
I know what I said.

727
00:32:39,920 --> 00:32:40,480
How did we?

728
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:41,040
How did we?

729
00:32:41,040 --> 00:32:44,960
OK, all right, guys, I'm looking at this month's new snacks.

730
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:46,000
They are amazing.

731
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:49,120
Well, what we got you some of these new snacks.

732
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:52,400
Sea salt pop pops pop pop.

733
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:54,400
Whole wheat strawberry figgy bars.

734
00:32:54,400 --> 00:32:58,480
OK, how about this dark cocoa num nums?

735
00:32:58,480 --> 00:32:59,520
Excuse me.

736
00:32:59,520 --> 00:33:02,720
Chocolate quinoa granola.

737
00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:04,800
Maple habanero.

738
00:33:04,800 --> 00:33:08,800
The shit out of this just because of your fun, your fun accents that you're

739
00:33:08,800 --> 00:33:09,040
doing.

740
00:33:09,040 --> 00:33:11,520
Maple habanero pretzel pops.

741
00:33:13,520 --> 00:33:14,320
I know.

742
00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:15,680
The praline pumpkin seeds.

743
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:17,120
Are those good?

744
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:18,880
God, it's amazing.

745
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:20,800
People at NatureBox asked me what snacks I wanted.

746
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:22,400
They're going to send me a box.

747
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:23,360
Like, I want all of them.

748
00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:24,240
You're getting free bows?

749
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:26,720
All these look amazing.

750
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:27,680
I'll share with you guys.

751
00:33:27,680 --> 00:33:28,480
Yeah, sure.

752
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:29,600
Yeah, you sure fucking will.

753
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:30,080
Can't wait.

754
00:33:31,040 --> 00:33:32,560
Coffee kettle popcorn.

755
00:33:32,560 --> 00:33:33,280
Like, goddamn.

756
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:35,840
So NatureBox is it's all healthy and stuff.

757
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:42,640
There's no there's no GMOs, no trans fat, no hard fruit, just no HMOs.

758
00:33:45,280 --> 00:33:48,640
You can choose wherever you want to go to the doctor with NatureBox.com.

759
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:50,720
It's true, but you will never need to again.

760
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:51,920
That's our guarantee.

761
00:33:51,920 --> 00:33:52,960
It's so fucking funny.

762
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:55,360
What's funny is like you won't even need to go to Warby Parker because you'll

763
00:33:55,360 --> 00:33:57,680
eat the fucking snacks and suddenly your eyesight will get better.

764
00:33:57,680 --> 00:33:58,560
Your vision's red.

765
00:33:58,560 --> 00:34:00,400
These are fashion Warby Parkers.

766
00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:01,520
I don't need them anymore.

767
00:34:01,520 --> 00:34:06,320
Check out my fashion Warby's.

768
00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:08,800
They'll send you a whole box of snacks.

769
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:12,560
You can eat the whole thing in one sitting and call the newspaper and tell them you're

770
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:14,160
a disaster.

771
00:34:14,160 --> 00:34:16,800
Then take off your Warby so you don't have to look at yourself in the mirror.

772
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:22,800
Take off your Warby so you don't have to see the pile of self-mess you've created and are

773
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:23,680
now living in.

774
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:25,520
Don't eat them all at once.

775
00:34:26,240 --> 00:34:27,920
They're healthy, but nothing's that healthy.

776
00:34:27,920 --> 00:34:31,040
Get one of the boxes to like eight people and just slam jam them.

777
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:33,840
If you drink water that much, you'll get water poisoning.

778
00:34:33,840 --> 00:34:37,360
Nothing is that healthy that you could eat an entire box of it in one sitting.

779
00:34:38,160 --> 00:34:42,560
Anyway, naturebox.com is healthy.

780
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:47,520
You're going to go to naturebox.com forward slash my brother and they'll give you 50%

781
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:49,040
off your first box.

782
00:34:50,240 --> 00:34:52,560
You can spend that on buying another box.

783
00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:55,120
You disaster because you ate the first one.

784
00:34:55,120 --> 00:34:56,160
Under a different name.

785
00:34:57,680 --> 00:34:59,440
My name is Bustin Lackalroyd.

786
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:01,680
I love your salt caramel pop pops.

787
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:03,200
Same address.

788
00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:08,160
I am best friends and roommates.

789
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:11,920
Just make sure you put apartment one and then apartment two and they'll never know.

790
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:14,800
I'm going to erase apartment one because that won't get there.

791
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:16,080
It's just a single family residence.

792
00:35:16,640 --> 00:35:18,400
But yeah, 50% off.

793
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:20,880
You will really like these snacks, so stay full, stay strong.

794
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:23,120
Go to naturebox.com slash my brother.

795
00:35:23,120 --> 00:35:27,120
That's naturebox.com slash my brother.

796
00:35:27,120 --> 00:35:29,920
I got a message for Brian from Sarah.

797
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:34,000
Brian, happy 10th anniversary and one year-ish until our wedding.

798
00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:37,200
Thank you for all the random hilarity you add to my life,

799
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:40,560
not including introducing me to the McElroy family of podcasts.

800
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:42,640
I fucking love the sound of that, by the way.

801
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:46,720
Now I finally understand the random laughter coming from the kitchen while you do dishes

802
00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:47,760
wearing headphones.

803
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:50,000
Also, thanks for always doing the dishes.

804
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:50,480
Love you.

805
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:52,400
Ah, that's so nice.

806
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:54,240
Man, should we expand our empire?

807
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:57,760
So like the idea of the McElroy family of podcasts.

808
00:35:58,560 --> 00:36:01,120
I've been thinking about getting into like drug running and numbers.

809
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:04,080
How would that help our podcast empire?

810
00:36:04,080 --> 00:36:06,000
Oh, no, I was just thinking like a family empire.

811
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:06,880
You were just thinking-

812
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:08,000
Like Boardwalk Empire?

813
00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:10,720
I haven't watched that show.

814
00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:11,280
Me neither.

815
00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:14,240
Okay, so, okay.

816
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:17,040
Brian and Sarah, happy 10th anniversary.

817
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:19,040
Happy, man, that sucks dick, doesn't it?

818
00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:20,880
That you guys like spend all that time.

819
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:22,800
You racked up 10 years and then after you get married,

820
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:24,160
you have to start right back at one, right?

821
00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:26,000
Just like the Brian McKnight song.

822
00:36:27,600 --> 00:36:30,160
This next one is, well, let me pronounce this name correctly.

823
00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:33,360
Master Brit Brad Jamison.

824
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:36,560
And that message is from Justin Steve.

825
00:36:37,520 --> 00:36:42,720
Justin Steve say, happy 25th one up birthday to he who gives good beard,

826
00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:45,040
great beer and mad super boops.

827
00:36:46,160 --> 00:36:46,480
What?

828
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:49,280
What could you be talking about?

829
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:52,080
How does one give good beard?

830
00:36:52,080 --> 00:36:54,160
That is very confusing to me, Master Brett.

831
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:55,360
Brad.

832
00:36:56,320 --> 00:36:57,520
Is it Brett or Brad?

833
00:36:58,720 --> 00:37:01,040
Brad is his nom de plume.

834
00:37:01,040 --> 00:37:02,320
Brad's his stage name.

835
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:05,440
Jess and Steve, they are-

836
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:07,120
Please, Brett was my father.

837
00:37:07,120 --> 00:37:07,840
Call me Brad.

838
00:37:11,600 --> 00:37:13,040
Gosh, Brett, 25.

839
00:37:13,040 --> 00:37:14,080
That's a great birthday.

840
00:37:14,080 --> 00:37:15,680
It says 25 plus one up.

841
00:37:15,680 --> 00:37:17,120
So I'm wondering if it's maybe 26.

842
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:19,760
Oh, he's gonna be 25 for a while.

843
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:20,720
Is that it?

844
00:37:20,720 --> 00:37:22,080
Is that it, Master Brett?

845
00:37:22,080 --> 00:37:23,600
Is that what's going on?

846
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:28,160
Happy birthday, Brad.

847
00:37:28,160 --> 00:37:28,960
Brad.

848
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:30,240
No, Brad is 32.

849
00:37:31,120 --> 00:37:32,560
Brad's my older dad.

850
00:37:34,080 --> 00:37:35,520
He was seven when he had me.

851
00:37:37,120 --> 00:37:38,000
Hey, Ross.

852
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:38,640
Hey, Carrie.

853
00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:40,000
Hey, it's me, your co-host.

854
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:41,120
Oh yeah, we have a show, don't we?

855
00:37:41,120 --> 00:37:42,000
We have a show.

856
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:43,840
Oh No, Ross and Carrie.

857
00:37:43,840 --> 00:37:46,640
It's about undercover investigations of fringe groups.

858
00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:49,040
Yeah, like the Tony Olomo Ministries cult.

859
00:37:49,040 --> 00:37:50,880
Yep, that's led by a pedophile.

860
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:51,680
He's in jail.

861
00:37:51,680 --> 00:37:52,880
He's in jail.

862
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:55,360
Also, we became Mormons.

863
00:37:55,360 --> 00:37:57,600
We became Raelians, which is a UFO group.

864
00:37:57,600 --> 00:37:58,160
That's right.

865
00:37:58,160 --> 00:38:00,320
We joined the Ordo Templi Orientis.

866
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:02,400
Yes, the 9-11 truthers.

867
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:03,120
We got cupped.

868
00:38:03,120 --> 00:38:04,080
We got acupunctured.

869
00:38:04,080 --> 00:38:04,880
We got rakey.

870
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:07,840
We've pretty much anything that you've heard of and been like,

871
00:38:07,840 --> 00:38:09,520
that doesn't sound quite right.

872
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:10,560
We've done that.

873
00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:12,000
So you don't have to do it.

874
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,880
So if you want to hear about this, and you should,

875
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:22,000
then go to maximumfun.org.

876
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:27,200
We are taking a moment out from our regularly scheduled program.

877
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:29,680
Every once in a while on My Brother, My Brother, Me,

878
00:38:29,680 --> 00:38:31,360
we like to welcome someone who actually

879
00:38:31,360 --> 00:38:33,520
knows anything about anything.

880
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:36,720
None of the three of us fill that criteria.

881
00:38:37,520 --> 00:38:39,680
But our guest today certainly does.

882
00:38:39,680 --> 00:38:42,800
John Roderick is a musician.

883
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:44,800
He is a podcaster.

884
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:46,320
He is an author.

885
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:48,720
He is a raconteur.

886
00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:54,000
A raconteur, a friend, a father figure to some, myself included.

887
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:54,800
An herbalist.

888
00:38:55,360 --> 00:38:56,080
An herbalist.

889
00:38:56,080 --> 00:38:58,720
John Roderick, welcome to My Brother, My Brother, Me.

890
00:38:58,720 --> 00:38:59,680
Thank you, fellows.

891
00:38:59,680 --> 00:39:00,240
Hello.

892
00:39:01,120 --> 00:39:03,920
Are you actually an herbalist or is Travis talking out of his ass?

893
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:06,640
No, everything that you said about me is 100% true.

894
00:39:06,640 --> 00:39:09,440
That's also the name of John's autobiography.

895
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:10,560
That's the full title.

896
00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:12,000
Everything you just said about me.

897
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:12,880
The full title.

898
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:14,160
Is 100% true.

899
00:39:14,160 --> 00:39:15,360
The John Roderick story.

900
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:18,960
Herbalist Secrets in the back, in the index.

901
00:39:19,680 --> 00:39:22,960
We asked the audience for questions for you

902
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:24,720
and we left it very open-ended.

903
00:39:24,720 --> 00:39:26,080
Because you're an open-ended man.

904
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:27,440
Well.

905
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:28,320
I think that's fair to say.

906
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:31,600
And we got a lot of, what would you say, Travis?

907
00:39:31,600 --> 00:39:32,100
Duds?

908
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:37,840
Well, no, see, this is the thing, guys.

909
00:39:37,840 --> 00:39:41,520
You know, like, what you might think is a dud question

910
00:39:41,520 --> 00:39:43,760
might either be, I mean, first of all,

911
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:44,960
could be a coded message.

912
00:39:46,720 --> 00:39:48,640
Warning you about your impending death.

913
00:39:48,640 --> 00:39:49,280
Well, or-

914
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:51,920
Or to activate you like my Manchurian candidate style.

915
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:52,400
That's right.

916
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:55,440
Or it might be one of my agents checking in with me.

917
00:39:56,960 --> 00:40:00,640
So what you might interpret as a dud could be something,

918
00:40:00,640 --> 00:40:03,840
you know, just that you don't understand, too sophisticated.

919
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:07,440
Or it might be a question that you think is a dud

920
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:09,360
because you haven't heard my answer yet.

921
00:40:09,360 --> 00:40:10,400
That's true.

922
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:12,880
It is just the spark that will light the fire

923
00:40:12,880 --> 00:40:14,240
of your intellect and wisdom.

924
00:40:14,240 --> 00:40:15,200
Yeah, you didn't have me-

925
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:17,040
Travis, maybe you should read the worst one.

926
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:21,120
You didn't have me on the show to try and get interesting

927
00:40:21,120 --> 00:40:22,800
questions from your ding-a-ling readers.

928
00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:23,680
No.

929
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:26,800
You had me on the show to answer questions

930
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:28,240
from your ding-a-ling readers.

931
00:40:28,240 --> 00:40:29,600
I guess they're not readers, are they?

932
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:32,080
Some of them probably do read.

933
00:40:32,720 --> 00:40:34,000
They just read the transcripts.

934
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:38,720
Yeah, that's the way to really, that's how you get the comedy.

935
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:41,200
I like to imagine what their voices sound like.

936
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:42,960
It would just be like, it'd be like a sentence

937
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:44,320
and then it would be sniffle noise

938
00:40:44,320 --> 00:40:46,320
and then another sentence and then sniffle noise.

939
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:50,400
Justin opens bag of pretzels.

940
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:52,960
I try to get them all out, but fuck, guys,

941
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:55,520
we are very nasally productive people.

942
00:40:55,520 --> 00:40:57,040
Poorly masked flatulence.

943
00:40:58,560 --> 00:41:00,320
Here's our first question for you, Mr. Rodger.

944
00:41:00,320 --> 00:41:02,000
Okay, I'm a musician.

945
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:10,560
Dear John, I am everyone who's ever asked you anything ever.

946
00:41:11,840 --> 00:41:13,280
This is not me.

947
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:14,960
This is another person who is.

948
00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:17,760
Justin is something of a musician, I would say.

949
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:22,880
Let's, listen, I can play you my Long Winter's covers

950
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:26,400
after we're done recording and you can pick the best one.

951
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:28,480
Yeah, that'll be a separate episode

952
00:41:28,480 --> 00:41:30,960
where you play me your music and I...

953
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:35,040
No, I play you my version of your music

954
00:41:35,040 --> 00:41:36,880
and you tell me if you think I got it.

955
00:41:36,880 --> 00:41:39,040
And then you do our bits.

956
00:41:39,040 --> 00:41:39,280
Okay.

957
00:41:39,280 --> 00:41:41,520
And then you do our bits.

958
00:41:41,520 --> 00:41:41,920
Classic.

959
00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:43,360
I'm a musician.

960
00:41:44,720 --> 00:41:46,560
I make this noise music.

961
00:41:47,120 --> 00:41:50,240
It fits well in the cliche of atonal ambient noise,

962
00:41:50,240 --> 00:41:53,200
although it's got a drive to it that's accessible.

963
00:41:53,200 --> 00:41:55,040
And I like to think I transcend the norm,

964
00:41:55,040 --> 00:41:56,720
but I'm just not getting heard.

965
00:41:56,720 --> 00:41:59,280
I know the music is all about the art of persistence.

966
00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:02,000
So do you have any tips on how I can sell myself,

967
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:05,520
how to solicit venues for gigs, how to get paid?

968
00:42:05,520 --> 00:42:08,720
Should I spam my poor Twitter following more hashtags?

969
00:42:08,720 --> 00:42:10,800
That's from Amy Vibes in Vermont.

970
00:42:12,080 --> 00:42:12,640
What do you think?

971
00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:16,640
It doesn't sound very good, does it?

972
00:42:16,640 --> 00:42:17,680
I mean, just between us.

973
00:42:17,680 --> 00:42:18,960
Well, not really selling it.

974
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:22,880
You know, yeah, there's a lot of underselling language for sure.

975
00:42:24,480 --> 00:42:28,560
I mean, using the word cliche to describe your own tunes is,

976
00:42:28,560 --> 00:42:33,120
I don't know, I feel like that's maybe a cultural signifier.

977
00:42:33,840 --> 00:42:36,080
They don't want to seem like they're too hungry.

978
00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:38,960
I also, I think the term noise music,

979
00:42:38,960 --> 00:42:40,080
and I understand that it's a genre,

980
00:42:40,080 --> 00:42:42,080
but it's always sounded so pejorative to me.

981
00:42:42,080 --> 00:42:42,400
Yeah.

982
00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:44,720
Because that sounds like noise is what like

983
00:42:44,720 --> 00:42:48,720
your shitty upstairs neighbor calls the music that you produce

984
00:42:48,720 --> 00:42:49,840
if they're shitty enough.

985
00:42:49,840 --> 00:42:50,080
Right.

986
00:42:51,520 --> 00:42:52,880
The neighbor, not the musicians.

987
00:42:52,880 --> 00:42:53,440
But you know,

988
00:42:53,440 --> 00:42:55,360
just downstairs making some noise music.

989
00:42:55,360 --> 00:42:57,840
Yeah, I play racket.

990
00:42:57,840 --> 00:42:58,720
You don't play racket?

991
00:42:58,720 --> 00:43:01,760
I feel like noise music, though, I mean, it's such a broad,

992
00:43:01,760 --> 00:43:02,640
it's like indie music.

993
00:43:02,640 --> 00:43:03,920
It's sort of a meaningless word.

994
00:43:04,640 --> 00:43:07,360
And it could, I mean, half the soundtracks these days

995
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:10,960
are what you would call noise music, right?

996
00:43:10,960 --> 00:43:13,200
I mean, what is the soundtrack to,

997
00:43:14,560 --> 00:43:17,840
what the hell was that movie with the, about the-

998
00:43:17,840 --> 00:43:18,400
Me, Dave.

999
00:43:19,040 --> 00:43:19,600
Goodfellas?

1000
00:43:19,600 --> 00:43:20,160
No.

1001
00:43:20,160 --> 00:43:20,640
Gattaca?

1002
00:43:20,640 --> 00:43:21,680
Goodfellas, that was good music.

1003
00:43:21,680 --> 00:43:24,480
No, the one about the goal or the oil miner.

1004
00:43:24,480 --> 00:43:27,360
Extensiz, extin, existence.

1005
00:43:27,360 --> 00:43:30,000
No, no, no, there's gonna be blood.

1006
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:30,960
There's gonna be blood.

1007
00:43:31,840 --> 00:43:33,280
I swear to you, there will be blood.

1008
00:43:33,280 --> 00:43:34,480
That was a lot of noise.

1009
00:43:35,200 --> 00:43:37,760
Yeah, it was all punk, tank, tank, tank.

1010
00:43:37,760 --> 00:43:40,320
And it sounded like, it sounded a lot of like,

1011
00:43:40,320 --> 00:43:42,480
that's what the, that's what an oil,

1012
00:43:43,040 --> 00:43:44,960
like an oil well sounds like.

1013
00:43:44,960 --> 00:43:47,760
That's what it sounds like inside the head of an oil well.

1014
00:43:47,760 --> 00:43:50,160
Let me ask you this question from this question,

1015
00:43:50,720 --> 00:43:51,760
because now it's got me thinking.

1016
00:43:53,360 --> 00:43:57,200
Is there a certain truth to, if you start making music, right?

1017
00:43:57,200 --> 00:43:57,840
Yeah.

1018
00:43:57,840 --> 00:43:59,280
If it takes off immediately,

1019
00:43:59,280 --> 00:44:00,960
if people seem to like it right away,

1020
00:44:00,960 --> 00:44:02,480
you know you've got something.

1021
00:44:02,480 --> 00:44:05,360
But if after like a couple years, you're still going,

1022
00:44:05,360 --> 00:44:08,720
hmm, I just don't feel like I'm getting heard and it's growing.

1023
00:44:09,280 --> 00:44:12,240
Is that like, you know, the world's way of going,

1024
00:44:12,240 --> 00:44:13,200
maybe it's not good.

1025
00:44:13,760 --> 00:44:14,240
No.

1026
00:44:14,240 --> 00:44:15,840
Maybe, maybe you got no future in this.

1027
00:44:15,840 --> 00:44:16,640
Not necessarily.

1028
00:44:16,640 --> 00:44:20,000
I feel like the, I feel like what happens is that,

1029
00:44:20,640 --> 00:44:22,960
I mean, anytime you've heard of a music scene,

1030
00:44:22,960 --> 00:44:26,080
that scene is already over.

1031
00:44:26,080 --> 00:44:26,880
Or you know what I mean?

1032
00:44:26,880 --> 00:44:29,360
Like that scene is not accepting any new members.

1033
00:44:30,560 --> 00:44:30,880
Right.

1034
00:44:30,880 --> 00:44:31,440
That scene's full up.

1035
00:44:31,440 --> 00:44:31,680
Right.

1036
00:44:31,680 --> 00:44:34,560
By the time, by the time anyone has heard of a scene,

1037
00:44:34,560 --> 00:44:36,720
it's like, sorry, too late to join that scene.

1038
00:44:36,720 --> 00:44:39,600
But that's, for most musicians, that's all,

1039
00:44:40,640 --> 00:44:41,760
you know, that's your reality.

1040
00:44:41,760 --> 00:44:42,800
You look at a scene and you're like,

1041
00:44:42,800 --> 00:44:44,400
well, I kind of identify with that scene.

1042
00:44:44,400 --> 00:44:46,960
I would like to be a part of that, but it's like, no chance.

1043
00:44:46,960 --> 00:44:49,040
That, that, those doors are closed.

1044
00:44:49,040 --> 00:44:51,040
Then why do people still make rock music,

1045
00:44:51,040 --> 00:44:53,120
which is the oldest music ever.

1046
00:44:53,120 --> 00:44:54,720
That's why it's called, it's called rock.

1047
00:44:54,720 --> 00:44:56,240
It's as old as rocks.

1048
00:44:56,240 --> 00:44:56,960
It's that.

1049
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:00,480
I think what ends up happening is that

1050
00:45:02,480 --> 00:45:04,560
the way to get, the way to get into,

1051
00:45:05,920 --> 00:45:07,920
the way for people to hear your music is,

1052
00:45:07,920 --> 00:45:12,480
it's very rare that somebody just makes genius music.

1053
00:45:12,480 --> 00:45:14,240
And I mean, this is the fantasy, right?

1054
00:45:14,240 --> 00:45:16,240
I used, my ex-girlfriend used to say to me like,

1055
00:45:16,240 --> 00:45:19,120
well, if your music is any good, you'll just make it.

1056
00:45:19,120 --> 00:45:21,920
And then people will come running and it's like, wow.

1057
00:45:21,920 --> 00:45:24,720
Yeah, because you're going to play it super fucking loud.

1058
00:45:24,720 --> 00:45:26,880
You're going to buy the biggest speakers ever.

1059
00:45:26,880 --> 00:45:27,440
Right, right.

1060
00:45:27,440 --> 00:45:28,880
You're going to, you know, you're going to just,

1061
00:45:28,880 --> 00:45:31,120
I mean, her version of reality was that like,

1062
00:45:31,120 --> 00:45:33,360
oh, somebody is going to hear you playing.

1063
00:45:33,360 --> 00:45:35,200
They're going to be walking by your house

1064
00:45:35,200 --> 00:45:36,880
and hear you playing and they're going to happen

1065
00:45:36,880 --> 00:45:38,000
to be a record executive.

1066
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:38,640
Sure, kid.

1067
00:45:38,640 --> 00:45:39,360
Yeah, exactly.

1068
00:45:39,360 --> 00:45:41,440
I mean, isn't that true of everybody who like,

1069
00:45:41,440 --> 00:45:44,480
wants to be an actor in movies or make paintings?

1070
00:45:44,480 --> 00:45:46,960
All I need is for someone to see it.

1071
00:45:46,960 --> 00:45:49,360
All I need is for someone to see it.

1072
00:45:49,360 --> 00:45:51,920
I'm a video game journalist, which is sort of like

1073
00:45:52,560 --> 00:45:54,320
the rock stars of fat people.

1074
00:45:54,320 --> 00:45:54,720
Sure.

1075
00:45:54,720 --> 00:45:57,600
And even that is, even that is like,

1076
00:45:57,600 --> 00:45:59,520
you hope you're going to get discovered

1077
00:45:59,520 --> 00:46:01,360
and you hope you, you make it.

1078
00:46:01,360 --> 00:46:04,400
But I still tell people that if you work really hard at it

1079
00:46:04,400 --> 00:46:06,400
and you're doing something really good,

1080
00:46:06,400 --> 00:46:07,840
that the, the cream.

1081
00:46:07,840 --> 00:46:09,280
It's not really, not what happened to you though.

1082
00:46:09,280 --> 00:46:09,840
Rise.

1083
00:46:09,840 --> 00:46:11,200
Is that like naive of me?

1084
00:46:11,200 --> 00:46:14,880
Some dude saw you kill a can of Pringles

1085
00:46:14,880 --> 00:46:16,240
six chips at a time.

1086
00:46:16,240 --> 00:46:19,760
And they're like, oh, buddy, eat no more.

1087
00:46:19,760 --> 00:46:20,480
You have made it.

1088
00:46:21,040 --> 00:46:23,600
I feel like what happens is anybody that makes it

1089
00:46:24,160 --> 00:46:28,000
then, then revises their origin story

1090
00:46:28,640 --> 00:46:31,280
and takes out all the parts of their origin story

1091
00:46:31,280 --> 00:46:32,320
where they're like, well, you know,

1092
00:46:32,320 --> 00:46:35,680
my mom really helped me a lot and my dad gave me eight grand.

1093
00:46:36,240 --> 00:46:40,160
And then I, and it turns out that I knew a guy who knew a guy

1094
00:46:40,160 --> 00:46:43,200
who knew a guy who got me on an elevator with a guy.

1095
00:46:43,200 --> 00:46:45,360
Like none of that is very interesting.

1096
00:46:45,360 --> 00:46:49,360
And it, and it, and people mistakenly feel like

1097
00:46:49,360 --> 00:46:51,440
they want to erase that part of their story

1098
00:46:52,480 --> 00:46:55,680
because it makes them, because it exposes the degree

1099
00:46:55,680 --> 00:46:58,240
to which you need a leg up or, you know,

1100
00:46:58,240 --> 00:47:00,640
it exposes their advantage, however small.

1101
00:47:00,640 --> 00:47:01,680
That's why I like The Voice.

1102
00:47:02,240 --> 00:47:03,680
I mean, there's a, there's, don't get me wrong.

1103
00:47:03,680 --> 00:47:05,520
There's a lot of reasons why I like The Voice.

1104
00:47:06,160 --> 00:47:06,480
I'm sure.

1105
00:47:06,480 --> 00:47:11,440
But when I watch The Voice every Tuesday night at 730.

1106
00:47:11,440 --> 00:47:12,320
And then again, Wednesday.

1107
00:47:12,320 --> 00:47:14,640
And again, Wednesday morning.

1108
00:47:14,640 --> 00:47:16,960
You just use this one of the advertisements

1109
00:47:16,960 --> 00:47:18,800
that you like subtly put into the show.

1110
00:47:18,800 --> 00:47:20,960
Is this how you guys get rich?

1111
00:47:20,960 --> 00:47:22,480
We're hoping to get free episodes.

1112
00:47:22,480 --> 00:47:23,600
When you watch The Voice.

1113
00:47:24,960 --> 00:47:26,000
That's how we get paid.

1114
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:27,120
It's a partner system.

1115
00:47:27,120 --> 00:47:29,600
When you watch The Voice on Fox at 730.

1116
00:47:29,600 --> 00:47:30,880
They sent us exclusive clips.

1117
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:33,600
Nobody doesn't know where like

1118
00:47:33,600 --> 00:47:35,600
that Soul Patrol dude came from.

1119
00:47:35,600 --> 00:47:38,320
He came from like season 15 of American Idol.

1120
00:47:38,320 --> 00:47:39,440
You know where he came from.

1121
00:47:39,440 --> 00:47:40,720
You know his whole backstory.

1122
00:47:41,360 --> 00:47:42,320
There's no guesswork.

1123
00:47:42,320 --> 00:47:44,800
And well, so then it sounds to me like

1124
00:47:44,800 --> 00:47:46,400
what she's asking there at the end

1125
00:47:46,400 --> 00:47:49,280
is that she shouldn't be embarrassed to say like,

1126
00:47:49,280 --> 00:47:50,800
hey, if you guys like this,

1127
00:47:50,800 --> 00:47:52,080
make sure to tell your friends

1128
00:47:52,080 --> 00:47:53,280
if you want to come see a show.

1129
00:47:53,280 --> 00:47:55,840
I mean, the problem with that is that,

1130
00:47:56,400 --> 00:47:57,920
you know, you cannot go out

1131
00:47:57,920 --> 00:48:02,480
and personally shake the hand of 30,000 people

1132
00:48:03,600 --> 00:48:06,240
and count that every one of those people

1133
00:48:06,240 --> 00:48:08,880
is going to hear and love your music.

1134
00:48:08,880 --> 00:48:11,600
You know, I feel like music has always

1135
00:48:11,600 --> 00:48:12,800
and even in the internet,

1136
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:16,400
future land that we're occupying now.

1137
00:48:16,400 --> 00:48:17,600
The shitty wasteland.

1138
00:48:18,240 --> 00:48:19,120
The shitty wasteland.

1139
00:48:19,120 --> 00:48:21,200
But the reason you hear about bands

1140
00:48:21,200 --> 00:48:23,280
is that they are part of a community

1141
00:48:23,840 --> 00:48:26,240
of other musicians and you like one

1142
00:48:26,240 --> 00:48:29,440
and then you're drawn to see

1143
00:48:29,440 --> 00:48:30,560
like who their friends are

1144
00:48:30,560 --> 00:48:33,360
and who they associate with.

1145
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:36,400
And most scenes, if you think about it,

1146
00:48:37,520 --> 00:48:40,080
most scenes are formed by bands

1147
00:48:40,080 --> 00:48:43,040
that are like,

1148
00:48:43,920 --> 00:48:45,280
the reason they form a scene

1149
00:48:45,280 --> 00:48:47,200
is that they are initially unwelcome

1150
00:48:47,200 --> 00:48:49,200
anywhere else, right?

1151
00:48:49,200 --> 00:48:52,240
You form a collective of other musicians

1152
00:48:52,240 --> 00:48:53,920
who are struggling

1153
00:48:55,040 --> 00:48:56,400
because you're living in a world

1154
00:48:56,400 --> 00:48:58,240
where it's like, oh, I'm not invited

1155
00:48:58,240 --> 00:48:59,440
into these other scenes.

1156
00:49:00,400 --> 00:49:02,560
All I have are these other jerks

1157
00:49:03,600 --> 00:49:04,560
who are right around me.

1158
00:49:04,560 --> 00:49:06,960
You get an Isle of Misfit toys thing going on,

1159
00:49:06,960 --> 00:49:08,880
but then eventually it becomes like

1160
00:49:08,880 --> 00:49:10,720
a continent of Misfit toys.

1161
00:49:10,720 --> 00:49:11,600
That's right.

1162
00:49:11,600 --> 00:49:13,600
And every music scene starts out

1163
00:49:13,600 --> 00:49:15,120
as an island of Misfit toys.

1164
00:49:15,120 --> 00:49:16,240
And most of the time,

1165
00:49:16,240 --> 00:49:17,760
those other bands,

1166
00:49:18,320 --> 00:49:19,920
maybe they don't sound like you.

1167
00:49:19,920 --> 00:49:21,200
Maybe, you know,

1168
00:49:21,200 --> 00:49:22,960
maybe you're friends

1169
00:49:22,960 --> 00:49:24,480
because you're just proximate

1170
00:49:24,480 --> 00:49:25,200
to one another.

1171
00:49:26,160 --> 00:49:28,240
But then a scene comes out of it

1172
00:49:28,240 --> 00:49:29,920
and other people look at it and go,

1173
00:49:29,920 --> 00:49:33,200
actually, there is a connective sound

1174
00:49:33,200 --> 00:49:34,400
between these acts

1175
00:49:35,120 --> 00:49:36,880
and it ends up being the next,

1176
00:49:36,880 --> 00:49:38,560
it ends up being the next sound, you know?

1177
00:49:38,560 --> 00:49:39,520
Yeah, maybe we're-

1178
00:49:39,520 --> 00:49:41,360
Can you con people into thinking

1179
00:49:41,360 --> 00:49:42,320
there is a scene,

1180
00:49:42,320 --> 00:49:44,400
sort of like an Emperor's New Clothes type situation?

1181
00:49:44,400 --> 00:49:45,840
Oh, the Vermont noise scene?

1182
00:49:45,840 --> 00:49:47,760
Oh, it's popping off right now.

1183
00:49:47,760 --> 00:49:49,680
If you're not making Vermont noise,

1184
00:49:49,680 --> 00:49:50,800
what are you even doing?

1185
00:49:50,800 --> 00:49:52,320
It's just leaves rustling.

1186
00:49:52,320 --> 00:49:54,000
I feel like every,

1187
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:55,760
I feel like everybody that wants to get

1188
00:49:55,760 --> 00:49:58,000
into show business feels like

1189
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:02,640
there's some kind of chemtrails-based conspiracy

1190
00:50:03,120 --> 00:50:04,960
that, yeah, it's all a con job.

1191
00:50:04,960 --> 00:50:07,280
It's all like, how do I get my, you know,

1192
00:50:07,280 --> 00:50:10,480
they're out there buying Facebook likes or whatever.

1193
00:50:11,360 --> 00:50:13,600
And I think it's much more likely

1194
00:50:13,600 --> 00:50:17,520
that if you go to see bands that interest you

1195
00:50:18,640 --> 00:50:21,440
and support your friends,

1196
00:50:21,440 --> 00:50:23,200
like, I think you go see music,

1197
00:50:23,200 --> 00:50:24,480
first of all, is the number one thing.

1198
00:50:24,480 --> 00:50:26,880
You support other musicians

1199
00:50:26,880 --> 00:50:28,320
and support music that you like.

1200
00:50:29,520 --> 00:50:32,240
Like, all that stuff happens very organically.

1201
00:50:32,240 --> 00:50:34,160
And every successful scene I've ever seen,

1202
00:50:34,160 --> 00:50:38,240
has come up organically among a group of people

1203
00:50:38,240 --> 00:50:40,240
that are going to each other's shows

1204
00:50:41,280 --> 00:50:43,920
and share a kind of like-minded desire

1205
00:50:43,920 --> 00:50:46,560
to perform a certain kind of music.

1206
00:50:46,560 --> 00:50:47,440
And pretty soon, you know,

1207
00:50:47,440 --> 00:50:49,040
you're putting on shows where it's like,

1208
00:50:49,040 --> 00:50:50,160
I'm playing with my friend's band.

1209
00:50:50,160 --> 00:50:51,840
I'm playing with my other friend's band.

1210
00:50:51,840 --> 00:50:54,640
You're not worried about penetrating

1211
00:50:54,640 --> 00:50:58,160
the big show business capital S

1212
00:50:58,160 --> 00:51:00,080
because you're making a little show business.

1213
00:51:01,040 --> 00:51:02,880
And then the big show business comes

1214
00:51:02,880 --> 00:51:04,240
looking for you.

1215
00:51:04,800 --> 00:51:06,240
I've noticed, John, that you have not

1216
00:51:06,240 --> 00:51:07,360
to this point mentioned,

1217
00:51:08,160 --> 00:51:10,560
put your music into an Apple commercial.

1218
00:51:11,360 --> 00:51:13,040
That seems to work.

1219
00:51:13,040 --> 00:51:14,720
Yeah, it seems like the easiest thing.

1220
00:51:14,720 --> 00:51:15,280
You're right.

1221
00:51:15,280 --> 00:51:16,320
It seems like the easier thing.

1222
00:51:16,320 --> 00:51:17,200
You're absolutely right.

1223
00:51:17,200 --> 00:51:18,960
I should have started off by saying,

1224
00:51:19,520 --> 00:51:22,160
first thing you do is get on an Apple commercial.

1225
00:51:22,160 --> 00:51:23,120
Just get into one of those.

1226
00:51:23,120 --> 00:51:24,080
I got another question for you.

1227
00:51:24,080 --> 00:51:25,680
Me and a close-knit group of friends

1228
00:51:25,680 --> 00:51:26,720
formed a rock band.

1229
00:51:26,720 --> 00:51:28,960
See, see what I'm saying?

1230
00:51:28,960 --> 00:51:29,760
Next question.

1231
00:51:29,760 --> 00:51:32,640
Travis, Travis, Travis.

1232
00:51:32,640 --> 00:51:34,160
That validates my viewpoint.

1233
00:51:34,160 --> 00:51:37,360
Travis, go back into the files

1234
00:51:37,360 --> 00:51:40,000
and get me something non-music related

1235
00:51:41,440 --> 00:51:43,600
as we talk about this next question.

1236
00:51:43,600 --> 00:51:43,920
All right.

1237
00:51:43,920 --> 00:51:44,160
Okay.

1238
00:51:44,720 --> 00:51:46,320
Me and a close-knit group of friends

1239
00:51:46,320 --> 00:51:47,120
formed a rock band,

1240
00:51:47,120 --> 00:51:48,800
but the problem is our drummer friend

1241
00:51:48,800 --> 00:51:52,400
is super flaky and rarely shows up to practice.

1242
00:51:52,400 --> 00:51:53,920
I don't want to lose him as a friend,

1243
00:51:53,920 --> 00:51:55,280
but we'll never get out of the garage

1244
00:51:55,280 --> 00:51:56,400
with him as our drummer.

1245
00:51:56,400 --> 00:51:58,640
How do I politely give him the old boot?

1246
00:51:58,640 --> 00:52:00,240
And that's from dropping the drummer

1247
00:52:00,240 --> 00:52:01,280
in Utah, friend.

1248
00:52:01,280 --> 00:52:02,720
You're in Utah.

1249
00:52:02,720 --> 00:52:06,080
I feel like this question is based on another

1250
00:52:07,120 --> 00:52:09,840
like rock industry myth

1251
00:52:09,840 --> 00:52:11,600
and that is that you have to practice.

1252
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:15,120
You just get in a room.

1253
00:52:15,120 --> 00:52:16,480
You just, you say like,

1254
00:52:16,480 --> 00:52:17,600
this is our sound, our sound.

1255
00:52:17,600 --> 00:52:18,560
What's our sound?

1256
00:52:18,560 --> 00:52:19,040
Get together.

1257
00:52:20,080 --> 00:52:20,880
That's it.

1258
00:52:20,880 --> 00:52:21,920
That's our sound.

1259
00:52:21,920 --> 00:52:23,040
Let's go smoke some weed.

1260
00:52:23,040 --> 00:52:25,040
Let's smoke a bunch of weed and see what happens.

1261
00:52:25,040 --> 00:52:26,320
Start designing our logo.

1262
00:52:27,920 --> 00:52:28,880
The number one thing-

1263
00:52:28,880 --> 00:52:30,400
We start with fog hat covers

1264
00:52:30,400 --> 00:52:32,400
and we just cruise into our own sound.

1265
00:52:32,400 --> 00:52:32,880
Perfect.

1266
00:52:32,880 --> 00:52:34,480
The number one thing any band needs to do

1267
00:52:34,480 --> 00:52:36,960
is get out a notebook of lined paper

1268
00:52:36,960 --> 00:52:38,320
and start designing your logo

1269
00:52:38,320 --> 00:52:42,560
because that's where you're going to get

1270
00:52:42,560 --> 00:52:43,840
an Apple commercial, I'll tell you why.

1271
00:52:43,840 --> 00:52:44,720
And make sure you have the proper-

1272
00:52:44,720 --> 00:52:46,960
And maybe your logo is you

1273
00:52:46,960 --> 00:52:48,560
kicking the drummer out the door.

1274
00:52:50,960 --> 00:52:53,920
Maybe you have a logo contest in the band

1275
00:52:53,920 --> 00:52:56,320
and say whoever draws the worst logo

1276
00:52:56,320 --> 00:52:57,760
is out of the band.

1277
00:52:57,760 --> 00:52:58,320
Is out.

1278
00:52:58,320 --> 00:53:00,320
And even if the drummer is a graphic artist-

1279
00:53:01,920 --> 00:53:02,800
I don't get it.

1280
00:53:02,800 --> 00:53:04,320
I use my 3D printer.

1281
00:53:04,320 --> 00:53:05,600
I created this logo.

1282
00:53:05,600 --> 00:53:08,800
It's a building of us playing.

1283
00:53:08,800 --> 00:53:10,800
Oh yeah, I like this guy's better.

1284
00:53:10,800 --> 00:53:13,360
He drew us as like stick figures all high-fiving.

1285
00:53:13,360 --> 00:53:14,160
You're out.

1286
00:53:14,160 --> 00:53:14,880
Yeah, you're out.

1287
00:53:14,880 --> 00:53:15,440
Sorry, bro.

1288
00:53:16,080 --> 00:53:16,640
Sorry.

1289
00:53:16,640 --> 00:53:18,240
He drew the Pearl Jam logo.

1290
00:53:19,040 --> 00:53:21,920
John, I don't want to unspool this incredible answer

1291
00:53:21,920 --> 00:53:22,800
that you just gave,

1292
00:53:22,800 --> 00:53:26,640
but does The Long Winters have a logo I don't know about?

1293
00:53:26,640 --> 00:53:30,320
I mean, like an Eskimo shrugging?

1294
00:53:30,320 --> 00:53:31,600
Like, what gives?

1295
00:53:32,160 --> 00:53:35,360
You know, the initial logo was of a guy

1296
00:53:35,360 --> 00:53:38,960
in a sort of an Eskimo style coat

1297
00:53:39,520 --> 00:53:40,800
pushing a snow blower.

1298
00:53:41,680 --> 00:53:44,560
And the snow blower produced a big cloud of snow cloud.

1299
00:53:45,280 --> 00:53:48,720
And The Long Winters name was in the snow cloud.

1300
00:53:48,720 --> 00:53:49,520
That was our original-

1301
00:53:49,520 --> 00:53:50,400
And it dripped blood.

1302
00:53:51,040 --> 00:53:51,920
Yeah, that's right.

1303
00:53:51,920 --> 00:53:52,240
That's right.

1304
00:53:53,840 --> 00:53:55,680
It's not exactly giant lips, is it?

1305
00:53:55,680 --> 00:53:56,640
I mean-

1306
00:53:56,640 --> 00:53:57,840
No, no, it's not.

1307
00:53:57,840 --> 00:53:58,880
And that was the problem with it.

1308
00:53:58,880 --> 00:54:00,480
If you look at the Nirvana logo,

1309
00:54:01,760 --> 00:54:02,240
the first thing-

1310
00:54:02,240 --> 00:54:04,080
Is that the one with the guns and roses in it?

1311
00:54:06,080 --> 00:54:08,240
No, that was the Alice in Chains logo.

1312
00:54:08,240 --> 00:54:10,480
The Nirvana logo is just the name Nirvana

1313
00:54:10,480 --> 00:54:11,600
in some kind of font.

1314
00:54:12,480 --> 00:54:13,120
And your first thought was-

1315
00:54:13,120 --> 00:54:14,400
I think it was the Wingdings.

1316
00:54:14,400 --> 00:54:15,440
Is it Wingdings font?

1317
00:54:16,400 --> 00:54:17,680
It's not Comic Sam.

1318
00:54:17,680 --> 00:54:19,600
It's an edgy fucking band, man.

1319
00:54:19,600 --> 00:54:21,360
They invented a sound and Wingdings.

1320
00:54:21,360 --> 00:54:22,960
You look at it and your first thought is

1321
00:54:22,960 --> 00:54:25,840
Nirvana is the stupidest band name

1322
00:54:25,840 --> 00:54:27,120
in the history of band names.

1323
00:54:28,320 --> 00:54:29,680
It seems reasonable now,

1324
00:54:29,680 --> 00:54:32,960
but when those guys from Aberdeen, Washington

1325
00:54:32,960 --> 00:54:34,160
were like, we're Nirvana?

1326
00:54:34,960 --> 00:54:35,920
Totally ridiculous.

1327
00:54:37,200 --> 00:54:38,640
But it looked good.

1328
00:54:39,680 --> 00:54:42,400
It was in a font that just looked right

1329
00:54:42,400 --> 00:54:47,040
and they put that same exact logo on everything they did.

1330
00:54:48,640 --> 00:54:50,880
And that's why they took off.

1331
00:54:50,880 --> 00:54:51,200
That's right.

1332
00:54:51,200 --> 00:54:53,200
Look at them compared to the Long Winters.

1333
00:54:53,200 --> 00:54:53,520
Yeah.

1334
00:54:53,520 --> 00:54:57,120
Who had some inscrutable Eskimo on there,

1335
00:54:58,400 --> 00:54:59,440
and it's just like,

1336
00:55:00,160 --> 00:55:01,760
by the time I got to Snow Cloud,

1337
00:55:01,760 --> 00:55:02,880
you guys weren't even listening.

1338
00:55:04,080 --> 00:55:04,560
That's true.

1339
00:55:04,560 --> 00:55:06,240
I was thinking about the letters dripping blood.

1340
00:55:06,240 --> 00:55:06,880
Yeah, yeah.

1341
00:55:07,520 --> 00:55:09,840
But in answer to this person's question,

1342
00:55:11,040 --> 00:55:14,080
the number of bands I've seen that have believed

1343
00:55:14,800 --> 00:55:18,560
that the integrity of the original lineup

1344
00:55:18,560 --> 00:55:22,320
or the core group was paramount.

1345
00:55:24,880 --> 00:55:28,880
And so they kind of willfully refused

1346
00:55:28,880 --> 00:55:30,720
to acknowledge that one of the guys

1347
00:55:30,720 --> 00:55:33,040
was not committed to being in the band

1348
00:55:33,600 --> 00:55:37,120
and that person was just committed enough

1349
00:55:37,120 --> 00:55:39,520
that they would be willing to stick around

1350
00:55:40,080 --> 00:55:43,280
and thwart the band's ambitions time and time again

1351
00:55:43,280 --> 00:55:44,640
until all was destroyed.

1352
00:55:44,640 --> 00:55:44,880
Sure.

1353
00:55:44,880 --> 00:55:48,480
That's a very common problem in collaborative work.

1354
00:55:48,480 --> 00:55:51,360
Like this person doesn't love the band enough

1355
00:55:51,360 --> 00:55:53,200
to recognize that they need to quit

1356
00:55:54,240 --> 00:55:55,280
for the band to do well.

1357
00:55:55,280 --> 00:55:57,360
I mean, that sounds like the saving grace to me

1358
00:55:57,360 --> 00:56:00,240
is he's not saying, hey, our drummer sucks.

1359
00:56:00,240 --> 00:56:02,320
Like he's super committed and he's always the first one

1360
00:56:02,320 --> 00:56:03,600
at practice and the last one to leave,

1361
00:56:03,600 --> 00:56:04,880
but he's just dumb.

1362
00:56:04,880 --> 00:56:07,120
Like you've got a great door opening to say like,

1363
00:56:07,120 --> 00:56:09,520
hey, Bill, do you remember how you haven't been here

1364
00:56:09,520 --> 00:56:10,800
for the last six weeks?

1365
00:56:10,800 --> 00:56:11,440
Yeah, out.

1366
00:56:11,440 --> 00:56:13,280
No, you shouldn't make him make him play

1367
00:56:13,280 --> 00:56:16,880
a show with you do like the actor's worst nightmare shit.

1368
00:56:16,880 --> 00:56:18,800
Like get him on a stage on practice.

1369
00:56:18,800 --> 00:56:20,400
He doesn't even know the songs.

1370
00:56:20,400 --> 00:56:21,440
You're playing like a slow ballad.

1371
00:56:21,440 --> 00:56:24,320
He's giving you like a good and you're like,

1372
00:56:24,320 --> 00:56:27,040
oh man, he's not going to want to even perform music anymore

1373
00:56:27,040 --> 00:56:28,480
after this embarrassing time.

1374
00:56:28,480 --> 00:56:29,760
But then to be fair, he's the drummer.

1375
00:56:29,760 --> 00:56:31,680
So he's walking out going nail that perfect.

1376
00:56:31,680 --> 00:56:32,320
Exactly.

1377
00:56:32,320 --> 00:56:33,120
That is the problem.

1378
00:56:33,120 --> 00:56:36,000
The drummer is going to be like, whoa, did you see my,

1379
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:37,360
did you see my performance?

1380
00:56:38,640 --> 00:56:39,520
That was amazing.

1381
00:56:39,520 --> 00:56:40,000
I don't know.

1382
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:41,760
You guys must not have seen that.

1383
00:56:41,760 --> 00:56:43,760
You guys must not have seen that thing you do

1384
00:56:43,760 --> 00:56:44,880
because the way that it shakes out

1385
00:56:44,880 --> 00:56:46,400
is that everybody instinctually starts

1386
00:56:46,400 --> 00:56:47,600
playing with the drummer.

1387
00:56:47,600 --> 00:56:49,120
Tom Hanks loves it.

1388
00:56:49,120 --> 00:56:50,000
You're famous.

1389
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:50,640
You're huge.

1390
00:56:50,640 --> 00:56:52,000
I guess it works either way.

1391
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:56,880
I mean, your point about not adhering to the original lineup

1392
00:56:56,880 --> 00:56:59,040
genre reminds me of something I was reading about just today.

1393
00:56:59,040 --> 00:57:01,280
I was reading up on the band The Suite or Sweet.

1394
00:57:02,080 --> 00:57:04,560
You may know from Ballroom Blitz fame.

1395
00:57:05,440 --> 00:57:07,360
The Suite had four guys in it.

1396
00:57:08,320 --> 00:57:10,000
Two of the guys died.

1397
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:14,800
The other two guys are now performing as individual suites

1398
00:57:15,680 --> 00:57:17,760
in the US and the UK.

1399
00:57:17,760 --> 00:57:18,320
Uh-huh.

1400
00:57:18,320 --> 00:57:19,600
They have franchised.

1401
00:57:19,600 --> 00:57:20,880
They have splinter-celled.

1402
00:57:20,880 --> 00:57:22,960
They have splinter-celled The Suite.

1403
00:57:22,960 --> 00:57:25,120
And half the band is dead.

1404
00:57:25,120 --> 00:57:29,600
The other half have basically asexually reproduced.

1405
00:57:29,600 --> 00:57:29,920
Right.

1406
00:57:29,920 --> 00:57:33,200
And half the members, twice the band.

1407
00:57:34,320 --> 00:57:35,920
Sweet UK, Sweet US.

1408
00:57:35,920 --> 00:57:36,560
Mm-hmm.

1409
00:57:36,560 --> 00:57:39,760
That's not, and that's not just resilience.

1410
00:57:39,760 --> 00:57:40,160
That's resilient.

1411
00:57:40,160 --> 00:57:41,120
That's creating jobs.

1412
00:57:41,120 --> 00:57:41,360
Yeah.

1413
00:57:42,560 --> 00:57:44,480
I mean, that's super common in rock and roll, right?

1414
00:57:44,480 --> 00:57:46,880
I mean, what the hell is Creedence Clearwater Revisited?

1415
00:57:47,760 --> 00:57:52,000
It's the three guys minus the guy that wrote all the songs

1416
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:54,080
and sang them and played all the guitar parts.

1417
00:57:54,080 --> 00:57:57,200
It's like if you keep swapping out members of Crosby, Stills,

1418
00:57:57,200 --> 00:57:58,960
Nash, and Young, and actually you don't even notice,

1419
00:57:58,960 --> 00:58:00,080
you don't know any of these guys.

1420
00:58:00,080 --> 00:58:00,400
Yeah.

1421
00:58:00,400 --> 00:58:01,920
Or the Commodores.

1422
00:58:01,920 --> 00:58:03,600
How many original Commodores are there left?

1423
00:58:03,600 --> 00:58:07,920
It's like one guy from the Commodores, his son, his son's

1424
00:58:07,920 --> 00:58:09,920
friend, his son's friend's dad.

1425
00:58:09,920 --> 00:58:11,520
One master general, one.

1426
00:58:11,520 --> 00:58:12,320
I like it.

1427
00:58:12,320 --> 00:58:12,960
Yeah, exactly.

1428
00:58:12,960 --> 00:58:17,920
Like the postman, like the postman's dog.

1429
00:58:17,920 --> 00:58:20,000
It's like it doesn't resemble the original band at all.

1430
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:20,880
Dr. Feelgood.

1431
00:58:21,600 --> 00:58:23,280
But listen, you got to fire the guy.

1432
00:58:23,280 --> 00:58:24,400
You got to fire the weak link.

1433
00:58:24,400 --> 00:58:28,480
I mean, I don't want to introduce any strife into the

1434
00:58:28,480 --> 00:58:31,040
my brother and my brother and me podcast.

1435
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:33,680
How do you start that conversation?

1436
00:58:33,680 --> 00:58:35,760
If we had, for instance, let's just role play

1437
00:58:35,760 --> 00:58:39,200
if we had to have it with Travis, let's just role play.

1438
00:58:39,200 --> 00:58:39,360
Sure.

1439
00:58:39,360 --> 00:58:40,080
Hold on.

1440
00:58:40,080 --> 00:58:40,320
Sure.

1441
00:58:40,320 --> 00:58:41,600
Like you got a weak link.

1442
00:58:41,600 --> 00:58:42,160
Yeah.

1443
00:58:42,160 --> 00:58:43,040
What are you going to say?

1444
00:58:43,040 --> 00:58:44,000
Hypothetical, Travis.

1445
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:44,400
Don't worry.

1446
00:58:45,120 --> 00:58:46,400
It's a hypothetical, Travis.

1447
00:58:46,400 --> 00:58:47,200
We're just picking.

1448
00:58:47,200 --> 00:58:48,400
It's any one of us.

1449
00:58:48,400 --> 00:58:49,520
Yeah, let me do it here.

1450
00:58:49,520 --> 00:58:51,040
I've got three names written on a piece of paper.

1451
00:58:51,040 --> 00:58:52,720
I'm going to throw them into the air and catch one.

1452
00:58:52,720 --> 00:58:54,000
I caught Travis.

1453
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:57,120
So for instance, in this situation, what I would do is I

1454
00:58:57,120 --> 00:58:59,840
would have like a guest expert come on the show.

1455
00:58:59,840 --> 00:59:00,640
Interesting.

1456
00:59:00,640 --> 00:59:02,000
That you kind of like better.

1457
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:03,920
That's like funnier, quicker than Travis.

1458
00:59:03,920 --> 00:59:06,480
We'd have to start doing that, but OK, yeah.

1459
00:59:06,480 --> 00:59:07,760
Sounds good so far.

1460
00:59:07,760 --> 00:59:08,080
Right.

1461
00:59:08,080 --> 00:59:10,480
And then after you establish a rapport,

1462
00:59:10,480 --> 00:59:12,080
where Travis just is kind of like trying

1463
00:59:12,080 --> 00:59:13,840
to get a word in edgewise and can.

1464
00:59:13,840 --> 00:59:14,320
Yeah.

1465
00:59:14,320 --> 00:59:14,880
Wait, hold on.

1466
00:59:14,880 --> 00:59:16,880
Then it becomes just kind of clear to him

1467
00:59:16,880 --> 00:59:17,760
that he's being supplanted.

1468
00:59:17,760 --> 00:59:19,280
Maybe it's time to.

1469
00:59:19,280 --> 00:59:20,320
How long do you think that would take?

1470
00:59:20,320 --> 00:59:23,600
Maybe 21 minutes and 48 seconds-ish.

1471
00:59:24,640 --> 00:59:26,560
I think he'd get the point pretty fast,

1472
00:59:26,560 --> 00:59:27,440
unless he's a drummer.

1473
00:59:28,640 --> 00:59:31,280
John, we wish we could keep talking to you.

1474
00:59:31,280 --> 00:59:32,400
Wait, I have one more question.

1475
00:59:32,400 --> 00:59:34,800
You guys hear that?

1476
00:59:34,800 --> 00:59:36,080
You'll like this.

1477
00:59:36,080 --> 00:59:36,960
OK, OK.

1478
00:59:36,960 --> 00:59:38,000
Real quick, Travis.

1479
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:40,000
Dear brothers and John Roderick, my girlfriend

1480
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:42,320
refuses to eat chicken unless it's been deboned.

1481
00:59:45,760 --> 00:59:48,640
No wings, legs, thighs, nothing unless the bones

1482
00:59:48,640 --> 00:59:50,160
are out of sight and out of mind.

1483
00:59:50,160 --> 00:59:52,720
She tells me it's because the bones are gross and morbid.

1484
00:59:52,720 --> 00:59:54,640
I tell her she is being hypocritical

1485
00:59:54,640 --> 00:59:56,240
and should consider vegetarianism

1486
00:59:56,240 --> 00:59:57,360
if she can't face facts.

1487
00:59:57,360 --> 00:59:59,040
Is my girlfriend being hypocritical

1488
00:59:59,040 --> 01:00:01,040
and how do I stop picking these dumbfights?

1489
01:00:01,040 --> 01:00:03,440
And that's from Thanks, I Eat the Bones in Texas.

1490
01:00:03,440 --> 01:00:08,000
And that is subject line Roderick specifically.

1491
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:11,120
John, have you done anything in your fucking life

1492
01:00:11,120 --> 01:00:12,560
that would make people think that you're

1493
01:00:12,560 --> 01:00:14,800
some sort of weird chicken expert, man?

1494
01:00:15,440 --> 01:00:17,120
As a matter of fact, yes.

1495
01:00:18,480 --> 01:00:21,600
I am a chicken fingers eater.

1496
01:00:22,480 --> 01:00:23,360
Are you a known?

1497
01:00:24,480 --> 01:00:29,200
I have listened to all of your albums back and forth.

1498
01:00:29,200 --> 01:00:31,360
I don't think there's a song on one of them

1499
01:00:31,360 --> 01:00:32,480
called Yummy Yum Yum.

1500
01:00:32,480 --> 01:00:33,760
I'm a chicken eater, man.

1501
01:00:33,760 --> 01:00:36,800
No, no, I keep I keep that part of my life separate.

1502
01:00:37,600 --> 01:00:39,200
That's sort of that's that's that's

1503
01:00:39,200 --> 01:00:40,960
on the private premises for you.

1504
01:00:40,960 --> 01:00:41,520
That's right.

1505
01:00:41,520 --> 01:00:46,480
But I, too, share your girlfriend's sort of distaste.

1506
01:00:46,480 --> 01:00:48,640
Not I don't think it's gross exactly,

1507
01:00:48,640 --> 01:00:52,640
but like if I were given a plate of chicken tenders

1508
01:00:53,760 --> 01:00:57,440
and next to it was a plate of like whole chicken parts,

1509
01:00:57,440 --> 01:01:01,360
and I prefer the processing because, you know,

1510
01:01:01,360 --> 01:01:03,600
you take a chicken, you have to kill it.

1511
01:01:03,600 --> 01:01:05,920
You have to pull the feathers out of it.

1512
01:01:05,920 --> 01:01:08,480
You have to wash it and pull all its guts out.

1513
01:01:08,480 --> 01:01:09,680
Then you have to chop it up.

1514
01:01:10,320 --> 01:01:12,240
Now, that's a lot of processing.

1515
01:01:13,280 --> 01:01:17,200
I don't see what is so I don't see why you stop processing

1516
01:01:17,200 --> 01:01:18,560
the fucking thing at that point.

1517
01:01:18,560 --> 01:01:20,640
Yeah, you get to like you do feathers

1518
01:01:20,640 --> 01:01:22,400
and then you're basically like, I'm done.

1519
01:01:22,960 --> 01:01:25,760
Keep processing it until it's just a pile of meat.

1520
01:01:25,760 --> 01:01:27,600
But when you've got bones, you know,

1521
01:01:27,600 --> 01:01:29,440
they're passing the savings along to you.

1522
01:01:30,240 --> 01:01:33,280
Yeah, that's the thing you're paying for that bone weight.

1523
01:01:33,280 --> 01:01:33,920
That's true.

1524
01:01:33,920 --> 01:01:34,720
That's another thing.

1525
01:01:34,720 --> 01:01:36,000
Like, if I'm going to pay the extra,

1526
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:40,320
I want to pay for the processing of somebody taking all that meat,

1527
01:01:40,320 --> 01:01:43,760
putting it in a little pile, breading it and deep frying it.

1528
01:01:43,760 --> 01:01:45,440
I don't want to have to sit.

1529
01:01:45,440 --> 01:01:48,480
I mean, I feel like the I feel like eating chicken off

1530
01:01:48,480 --> 01:01:53,760
the bone is the last vestige of like feral.

1531
01:01:53,760 --> 01:01:56,880
Like animal instinct that most of us get to experience.

1532
01:01:56,880 --> 01:01:59,120
You're sitting you're sitting at your freaking desk all day

1533
01:01:59,120 --> 01:02:00,320
in an air on chair.

1534
01:02:01,200 --> 01:02:04,560
You go down to an air conditioned garage and get in your Prius.

1535
01:02:04,560 --> 01:02:07,200
You drive to your air conditioned garage in your subdivision.

1536
01:02:07,200 --> 01:02:08,640
And then you're eating chicken off the bone.

1537
01:02:08,640 --> 01:02:09,680
And you think you're a wild man.

1538
01:02:12,880 --> 01:02:16,480
And then you bury the bones in the backyard and shit by the tree.

1539
01:02:16,480 --> 01:02:19,360
And your girlfriend is some kind of wuss because she wants

1540
01:02:19,360 --> 01:02:20,880
she wants it to come to her.

1541
01:02:20,880 --> 01:02:26,160
Like as a Totino's pizza roll, like, yeah, fully processed chicken pills.

1542
01:02:26,160 --> 01:02:30,720
She wants she wants someone from what's a chicken company?

1543
01:02:30,720 --> 01:02:35,600
Who does who's good about Dyson, Tyson, Tyson, Tyson, Dyson, Dyson, Dyson.

1544
01:02:35,600 --> 01:02:37,600
Mr. Dyson rolls up, chews up the chicken,

1545
01:02:37,600 --> 01:02:39,360
spits it in your girlfriend's mouth.

1546
01:02:39,360 --> 01:02:40,560
That's what you want.

1547
01:02:40,560 --> 01:02:41,840
That's what you're asking for.

1548
01:02:42,400 --> 01:02:46,800
You want chicken paste that is formed into the shape of of little chickens

1549
01:02:46,800 --> 01:02:48,000
like they do at McDonald's.

1550
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:51,520
Yeah, we're stars or dinosaurs. Dinosaurs is fine.

1551
01:02:52,240 --> 01:02:55,920
John, if you would like to spend more time with John Roger and who wouldn't?

1552
01:02:56,640 --> 01:02:58,000
You have that opportunity.

1553
01:02:58,000 --> 01:03:03,120
You can go to boatparty.biz and hop on to the Atlantic Ocean

1554
01:03:03,120 --> 01:03:04,720
Comedy and Music Festival.

1555
01:03:04,720 --> 01:03:05,520
John, what's that?

1556
01:03:06,480 --> 01:03:12,000
Well, it is a I was not aware how ad driven this podcast was.

1557
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:15,520
It is all for every time we mentioned boatparty.biz.

1558
01:03:15,520 --> 01:03:18,160
We get a free book. If you can talk about how delicious the Tyson

1559
01:03:18,160 --> 01:03:20,080
chicken served on this boat is going to be.

1560
01:03:20,800 --> 01:03:22,160
So you show up on the process.

1561
01:03:22,160 --> 01:03:23,520
Is it you show up on the boat?

1562
01:03:23,520 --> 01:03:26,880
The first thing that the first thing that happens is the first thing you see

1563
01:03:26,880 --> 01:03:28,720
is some kind of animal.

1564
01:03:29,280 --> 01:03:33,200
The original cruise I went on, it was a lion, sometimes it's a dolphin

1565
01:03:33,840 --> 01:03:39,120
carved out of butter, sitting in it, sitting in a bowl of ice next to a

1566
01:03:39,120 --> 01:03:39,600
swimming pool.

1567
01:03:40,640 --> 01:03:44,080
And I mean, that's that's your first impression of a swimming pool.

1568
01:03:44,080 --> 01:03:45,600
I mean, that's that's your first impression.

1569
01:03:45,600 --> 01:03:46,960
Use your imagination from there.

1570
01:03:47,520 --> 01:03:52,320
That is the degree of luxury you are experiencing on even the on even

1571
01:03:52,320 --> 01:03:53,440
the smallest cruise.

1572
01:03:54,720 --> 01:03:59,120
And boatparty.biz, of course, is a major cruise property.

1573
01:04:00,720 --> 01:04:02,320
Is it fun? Can we go back to the butter?

1574
01:04:02,320 --> 01:04:05,680
I hate to stall out here, but is it functional butter or is this?

1575
01:04:06,560 --> 01:04:08,400
Are you going to be the asshole?

1576
01:04:08,400 --> 01:04:10,560
Is it just a time keeping mechanism?

1577
01:04:10,560 --> 01:04:13,280
If you're the guy who dips in first, are you the asshole?

1578
01:04:13,280 --> 01:04:15,200
I think you just go after that butter.

1579
01:04:15,200 --> 01:04:19,920
And, you know, what's what ends up happening, I think, is is that they

1580
01:04:19,920 --> 01:04:21,280
use that butter for the rest of the cruise.

1581
01:04:21,280 --> 01:04:23,680
Like if you're eating it, if you're eating a scone on the last day of

1582
01:04:23,680 --> 01:04:25,840
the cruise, it came from the dolphin tail.

1583
01:04:27,840 --> 01:04:28,320
So I go.

1584
01:04:28,320 --> 01:04:29,840
OK, so you go nose to tail.

1585
01:04:29,840 --> 01:04:30,640
Yeah, I go right.

1586
01:04:30,640 --> 01:04:31,280
I go right.

1587
01:04:31,280 --> 01:04:31,680
I go.

1588
01:04:31,680 --> 01:04:34,240
I go right for the lion, right for the butter lion.

1589
01:04:34,240 --> 01:04:35,440
Just dig right in.

1590
01:04:35,440 --> 01:04:36,640
That's how you know you're on the boat.

1591
01:04:36,640 --> 01:04:41,760
Is there is there any entertainment acts or is it just looking at butter?

1592
01:04:41,760 --> 01:04:46,800
Mostly, I will tell you, I've been on a lot of cruises and the boat party

1593
01:04:46,800 --> 01:04:52,640
that biz last year was I mean, it was it was absolutely a singular cruise

1594
01:04:52,640 --> 01:04:54,640
experience, freaking hilarious.

1595
01:04:55,280 --> 01:04:58,880
It's a it's a small it's a small enough boat that there's a lot of

1596
01:04:58,880 --> 01:05:01,840
interaction with the with the entertainment.

1597
01:05:01,840 --> 01:05:07,280
There's so much entertainment on the bill that you almost can't help but

1598
01:05:07,280 --> 01:05:11,280
interact with them, because when you go into your state room, there's a

1599
01:05:11,280 --> 01:05:14,080
chance that one of the comedians or musicians is actually going to be

1600
01:05:14,080 --> 01:05:15,760
in there fluffing your pillow.

1601
01:05:15,760 --> 01:05:20,240
Yeah, that's that's how Chris Fairbanks earned his ticket on board.

1602
01:05:20,240 --> 01:05:24,720
We had such a hilarious time last year, the last night of the cruise,

1603
01:05:24,720 --> 01:05:29,280
the entire like all the performers all jumped in the swimming pool at

1604
01:05:29,280 --> 01:05:30,560
about one o'clock in the morning.

1605
01:05:30,560 --> 01:05:34,640
Eugene Mermin was like first in with I think he had a bottle of brandy in

1606
01:05:34,640 --> 01:05:38,480
one hand and maybe like a vape cigarette in the other.

1607
01:05:39,840 --> 01:05:40,960
Everybody in the pool.

1608
01:05:41,680 --> 01:05:42,880
I hope you got home all right.

1609
01:05:43,520 --> 01:05:44,320
Oh, yeah, he's fine.

1610
01:05:44,320 --> 01:05:44,880
He survived.

1611
01:05:45,920 --> 01:05:49,440
Boat party is just added Todd Barry, who is I think going to be performing

1612
01:05:49,440 --> 01:05:53,840
the Eugene Mermin role this year of embarrassing himself in a pool.

1613
01:05:53,840 --> 01:05:57,440
Yeah, although although he will not have a bottle of brandy or a vape

1614
01:05:57,440 --> 01:06:02,160
cigarette or get in the pool, but otherwise he will be he'll be the

1615
01:06:02,160 --> 01:06:03,440
spark that ignites it.

1616
01:06:03,440 --> 01:06:04,000
Yeah, that's right.

1617
01:06:04,640 --> 01:06:08,560
Now, Joe, we're not going to be on the cruise, so can you describe it

1618
01:06:08,560 --> 01:06:12,080
again but make it sound worse and shittier so I don't feel so bad?

1619
01:06:14,240 --> 01:06:14,720
Let's see.

1620
01:06:16,240 --> 01:06:20,800
The city of Nassau, Bahamas feels a little dangerous.

1621
01:06:21,520 --> 01:06:23,120
It's a beautiful paradise, John.

1622
01:06:23,120 --> 01:06:24,720
It's a beautiful paradise.

1623
01:06:24,720 --> 01:06:28,560
But but yeah, it's you know, it's it's a little bit.

1624
01:06:28,560 --> 01:06:33,440
It has that shabby chic of a of a of that is so characteristic of the

1625
01:06:33,440 --> 01:06:34,320
Mediterranean.

1626
01:06:34,320 --> 01:06:36,640
It was a valiant effort, but the whole thing is going to be magical.

1627
01:06:36,640 --> 01:06:40,080
Last year on Nassau, I rented a I rented a scooter and drove to the

1628
01:06:40,080 --> 01:06:42,960
other side of the island with a beautiful girl on the back.

1629
01:06:42,960 --> 01:06:45,840
And we got caught in a brief warm rainstorm.

1630
01:06:45,840 --> 01:06:51,040
If that makes it so that we were both just soaked to the bone.

1631
01:06:51,040 --> 01:06:54,560
Oh, it was so bad.

1632
01:06:54,560 --> 01:06:58,400
That sounds like the day that Bill Murray talks about wishing he had

1633
01:06:58,400 --> 01:07:00,400
instead of Groundhog Day and Groundhog Day.

1634
01:07:03,520 --> 01:07:04,720
Oh, no, wait, wait, wait.

1635
01:07:04,720 --> 01:07:07,920
I got soaked and my my iPhone got wet.

1636
01:07:07,920 --> 01:07:09,520
Oh, no.

1637
01:07:10,080 --> 01:07:12,960
So that now when I take it in to have it serviced, they give me the

1638
01:07:12,960 --> 01:07:14,720
stink eye at the Apple store.

1639
01:07:14,720 --> 01:07:17,360
Does that make is the phone still wet, John?

1640
01:07:17,360 --> 01:07:19,440
From last year, it still works.

1641
01:07:19,440 --> 01:07:22,400
But, you know, they have some litmus paper in there that's like, oh,

1642
01:07:22,400 --> 01:07:25,600
this phone is pregnant and you can't it won't get fixed anymore.

1643
01:07:26,720 --> 01:07:28,240
If you get it wet after midnight.

1644
01:07:28,240 --> 01:07:28,720
Yeah, right.

1645
01:07:28,720 --> 01:07:30,880
They're giving you the stink eye because your phone smells like the

1646
01:07:30,880 --> 01:07:34,000
funnest thing to ever happen and they didn't get to go.

1647
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:37,040
Well, what happened is it would turn from a Mowgli into a gremlin.

1648
01:07:37,040 --> 01:07:39,760
And now I have to deal with this fucking angry gremlin phone all the

1649
01:07:39,760 --> 01:07:40,080
time.

1650
01:07:40,080 --> 01:07:43,920
John Roderick, thank you so, so much for joining us on our show.

1651
01:07:43,920 --> 01:07:46,640
It is it is a a real pleasure.

1652
01:07:46,640 --> 01:07:52,720
BoatParty.biz is where people can go if they want to spend some time

1653
01:07:52,720 --> 01:07:53,600
with you.

1654
01:07:53,600 --> 01:07:54,720
Personal time.

1655
01:07:54,720 --> 01:07:57,120
Me and many other great performers.

1656
01:07:57,680 --> 01:07:58,480
So many others.

1657
01:07:59,040 --> 01:08:01,120
And you're on Twitter, of course.

1658
01:08:02,560 --> 01:08:06,080
John Roderick, that's R-O-D-E-R-I-C-K.

1659
01:08:06,080 --> 01:08:08,320
Is there anything else you would like to promote?

1660
01:08:08,320 --> 01:08:11,520
Do we still announce being on Twitter as though it's something?

1661
01:08:11,520 --> 01:08:13,360
That not everybody is already doing.

1662
01:08:13,360 --> 01:08:14,480
Let me check my notes here.

1663
01:08:14,480 --> 01:08:16,640
You're on something called Twitter?

1664
01:08:16,640 --> 01:08:18,400
I just don't want people to have to look for you.

1665
01:08:18,400 --> 01:08:22,240
I want them to just have a direct line to your to your feed so they can

1666
01:08:22,240 --> 01:08:22,560
follow.

1667
01:08:22,560 --> 01:08:25,680
At John Roderick on Twitter, you should listen to my podcast, which is

1668
01:08:25,680 --> 01:08:29,200
called Roderick on the Line, which is not part of the Maximum Fun

1669
01:08:29,200 --> 01:08:31,440
Network for reasons that are unclear to me.

1670
01:08:32,160 --> 01:08:35,040
But I am just a I'm just a lonely soldier in the world.

1671
01:08:35,040 --> 01:08:36,880
We can't afford we can't afford Merlin.

1672
01:08:36,880 --> 01:08:42,000
His his writer is like, believe me, I know it's it's absinthe all the

1673
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:42,480
way down.

1674
01:08:42,480 --> 01:08:43,680
But yeah, that's right.

1675
01:08:43,680 --> 01:08:45,360
I do a podcast with Merlin Man.

1676
01:08:45,920 --> 01:08:50,000
And yeah, I'm just you know, I'm part of the the general fabric of the

1677
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:52,720
American sub entertainment business.

1678
01:08:53,920 --> 01:08:56,080
And you will see me in your town at some point.

1679
01:08:56,080 --> 01:08:56,880
You'll see him.

1680
01:08:56,880 --> 01:08:59,440
Are you going to are you going to I know you've been I know you've been

1681
01:08:59,440 --> 01:09:03,040
playing playing some shows up in the up in the Pacific Northwest.

1682
01:09:03,040 --> 01:09:05,920
Are you planning on doing that more countrywide?

1683
01:09:05,920 --> 01:09:06,720
Good question.

1684
01:09:06,720 --> 01:09:07,760
Well, I'm going on a cruise.

1685
01:09:07,760 --> 01:09:08,720
Did I tell you about that?

1686
01:09:08,720 --> 01:09:09,120
Right.

1687
01:09:09,120 --> 01:09:11,040
Is that cruise coming to Austin, fucking Texas?

1688
01:09:11,040 --> 01:09:12,720
Are you going to park the boat in Lady Bird Lake?

1689
01:09:14,720 --> 01:09:16,640
You know, why the hell is that called a lake?

1690
01:09:16,640 --> 01:09:17,680
It's a fucking river.

1691
01:09:17,680 --> 01:09:19,440
It's a I mean, it is a lake.

1692
01:09:19,440 --> 01:09:19,920
It's close.

1693
01:09:19,920 --> 01:09:22,080
You put it you put a dam on a river.

1694
01:09:22,080 --> 01:09:23,280
I guess you can call it a lake.

1695
01:09:23,280 --> 01:09:24,560
It still looks like a river.

1696
01:09:24,560 --> 01:09:26,960
It's a fucked up river, but it's the slowest moving.

1697
01:09:26,960 --> 01:09:28,880
They can't call it Lady Bird fucked up river.

1698
01:09:29,600 --> 01:09:31,200
This is the greatest podcast.

1699
01:09:31,200 --> 01:09:31,700
All right.

1700
01:09:32,240 --> 01:09:33,680
No, we will come to Austin.

1701
01:09:34,480 --> 01:09:38,640
We'll come to Austin very soon because, you know, Austin loves the long

1702
01:09:38,640 --> 01:09:41,280
loves the long winters and we love Austin.

1703
01:09:41,280 --> 01:09:42,000
We love you.

1704
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:44,480
Thank you so much for joining us, Mr.

1705
01:09:44,480 --> 01:09:46,480
Roderick, John, if you don't mind.

1706
01:09:46,480 --> 01:09:47,280
Thank you, bros.

1707
01:09:48,320 --> 01:09:48,820
Sure.

1708
01:09:49,280 --> 01:09:52,080
And I think there's more show after this.

1709
01:09:52,080 --> 01:09:54,080
So let's go back to the show.

1710
01:09:55,040 --> 01:09:56,560
That is also us.

1711
01:09:56,560 --> 01:09:57,680
It'll be just like this.

1712
01:10:00,480 --> 01:10:01,200
How about a Yahoo?

1713
01:10:01,840 --> 01:10:02,340
Quickie.

1714
01:10:03,600 --> 01:10:04,800
This who was sent in by Drew.

1715
01:10:04,800 --> 01:10:05,280
Thanks, Drew.

1716
01:10:05,280 --> 01:10:06,560
It's by Yahoo Answers User.

1717
01:10:06,560 --> 01:10:07,200
They've been deleted.

1718
01:10:09,200 --> 01:10:11,040
They ask, do you ever get scared?

1719
01:10:11,040 --> 01:10:13,200
Your parents might find out about Sims 4.

1720
01:10:15,520 --> 01:10:18,240
I'm assuming they mean Sims 3 because obviously Sims 4 is not yet.

1721
01:10:18,240 --> 01:10:22,560
But I am very much looking forward to the new create a Sim system with dynamic face dragging.

1722
01:10:23,920 --> 01:10:24,560
Watch the trailer.

1723
01:10:24,560 --> 01:10:25,120
It looks great.

1724
01:10:25,120 --> 01:10:26,240
This face dragging.

1725
01:10:26,240 --> 01:10:27,040
It looks out of control.

1726
01:10:27,840 --> 01:10:32,880
It has woohooing and stuff in the game, but I don't do that stuff except woohooing to make kids.

1727
01:10:32,880 --> 01:10:36,480
I get scared my parents might find out and I may not be able to play it anymore.

1728
01:10:36,480 --> 01:10:40,080
That's why I limit my woohooing, kissing, hugging, and touching.

1729
01:10:40,080 --> 01:10:43,280
I tell my parents my Sim is single and she's not ready to mingle.

1730
01:10:43,920 --> 01:10:45,520
When they ask, who's the guy in the house?

1731
01:10:45,520 --> 01:10:48,320
I ask them what guy they're talking about until they leave me alone.

1732
01:10:49,760 --> 01:10:50,480
Jesus Christ.

1733
01:10:51,760 --> 01:10:53,520
I only woohoo to make kids.

1734
01:10:54,640 --> 01:10:55,680
I don't throw this out.

1735
01:10:55,680 --> 01:10:58,320
When you first asked the question, Griff, I was like, I don't know.

1736
01:10:58,320 --> 01:10:58,820
I don't know.

1737
01:10:58,820 --> 01:10:59,320
I don't know.

1738
01:10:59,320 --> 01:10:59,820
I don't know.

1739
01:10:59,820 --> 01:11:00,320
I don't know.

1740
01:11:00,320 --> 01:11:00,820
I don't know.

1741
01:11:00,820 --> 01:11:01,320
I don't know.

1742
01:11:01,320 --> 01:11:01,820
I don't know.

1743
01:11:01,820 --> 01:11:02,320
I don't know.

1744
01:11:02,320 --> 01:11:04,160
When you asked the question, Griffin, I was afraid you meant something like,

1745
01:11:04,160 --> 01:11:08,800
I'm afraid my parents will find out about Facebook and start using it and contacting all my friends.

1746
01:11:08,800 --> 01:11:09,560
Well, yeah.

1747
01:11:09,560 --> 01:11:12,800
But you don't want your parents woohooing on the side.

1748
01:11:13,520 --> 01:11:15,760
You want to only know that they woohooed once.

1749
01:11:15,760 --> 01:11:16,480
And then you were born.

1750
01:11:16,480 --> 01:11:17,520
To make you.

1751
01:11:17,520 --> 01:11:18,480
That's the ideal.

1752
01:11:19,840 --> 01:11:22,080
They could somehow, like, genetically woohoo

1753
01:11:22,640 --> 01:11:25,760
so that none of their Sim bits actually touch, but that would be wonderful.

1754
01:11:26,480 --> 01:11:31,280
You, uh, while Griffin was reading this question, my connection broke up so I didn't hear it.

1755
01:11:31,280 --> 01:11:40,280
And I was going to stop and say something, assume it, but I decided not to, assuming that I would be able to assemble the question through context clues.

1756
01:11:40,280 --> 01:11:44,280
That is becoming increasingly unlikely, it seems.

1757
01:11:44,280 --> 01:11:47,280
No, this will be fun. This will be like a board game.

1758
01:11:47,280 --> 01:11:58,280
So, I think, I mean, if I was a parent and I saw my kid woohooing and kissing, hugging, and touching virtual boys or girls,

1759
01:11:58,280 --> 01:12:03,280
I would say, I don't care if your sim is single and not ready to mingle.

1760
01:12:03,280 --> 01:12:08,280
I'm not interested in watching you do this, because I have to watch everything you do on your computer.

1761
01:12:08,280 --> 01:12:11,280
Because if I look away for a second, you'll be abducted.

1762
01:12:11,280 --> 01:12:16,280
Through the computer, like in Captain Man. You'll be sucked right into the screen.

1763
01:12:16,280 --> 01:12:19,280
You'll be sucked in. Mother brain will fucking snatch you up.

1764
01:12:19,280 --> 01:12:21,280
Also, like, several issues of Are You Afraid of the Dark, I believe.

1765
01:12:21,280 --> 01:12:25,280
Yeah, there's basically the plot of every other Are You Afraid of the Dark.

1766
01:12:25,280 --> 01:12:30,280
I would be willing to bet that if this is a big enough of a problem for this question asker,

1767
01:12:30,280 --> 01:12:34,280
that their parents keep bringing this up, they're already pretty worried about it.

1768
01:12:34,280 --> 01:12:35,280
Yeah.

1769
01:12:35,280 --> 01:12:43,280
If it's enough that you have to constantly explain to your parents that while your sim is single, she is not ready to mingle,

1770
01:12:43,280 --> 01:12:46,280
the parents are going, what the fuck is wrong with our kid?

1771
01:12:46,280 --> 01:12:50,280
Can we all admit how we play The Sims right now for once and all and settle it?

1772
01:12:50,280 --> 01:12:55,280
We all start it like, oh, I'm going to start it and I'm going to recreate the house I live in.

1773
01:12:55,280 --> 01:13:00,280
Or maybe I'm just going to pick up some architectural studies and test out what kind of crazy MCS or shit I can make.

1774
01:13:00,280 --> 01:13:02,280
He was the guy who made all the buildings.

1775
01:13:02,280 --> 01:13:06,280
And then, you know, maybe I'll make a boat or something.

1776
01:13:06,280 --> 01:13:11,280
Or maybe, you know what, I'm going to have a guy that's really good at guitar and he becomes the most famous guitarist on the earth.

1777
01:13:11,280 --> 01:13:12,280
That's what I'm going to do.

1778
01:13:12,280 --> 01:13:17,280
And then 15 minutes later, you're trying to get your sim to fuck everybody in town. Everybody.

1779
01:13:17,280 --> 01:13:22,280
I feel like it is like a psychological test that if you watch someone play Sims, they're either going to end up,

1780
01:13:22,280 --> 01:13:27,280
A, being the most boring, all-knowing, all-powerful being in the world.

1781
01:13:27,280 --> 01:13:31,280
They're going to, B, spend all their time trying to make their Sims fuck.

1782
01:13:31,280 --> 01:13:35,280
Or, C, they're going to put walls up around a Sim and make them pee themselves and die.

1783
01:13:35,280 --> 01:13:40,280
I'm going to download the celebrity skins so they look famous.

1784
01:13:40,280 --> 01:13:45,280
And I'll lock, like, Greatest American Hero and MC Hammer in a room.

1785
01:13:45,280 --> 01:13:48,280
And MC Usher.

1786
01:13:48,280 --> 01:13:49,280
And MC Usher.

1787
01:13:49,280 --> 01:13:50,280
MC Usher.

1788
01:13:50,280 --> 01:13:52,280
And then you make them all fuck.

1789
01:13:52,280 --> 01:13:55,280
And then you put a fireplace in the room.

1790
01:13:55,280 --> 01:13:56,280
I'll take care of them.

1791
01:13:56,280 --> 01:14:03,280
That's what Kanye West, when he wrote the album My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy, that's what he was talking about.

1792
01:14:03,280 --> 01:14:05,280
About Sims?

1793
01:14:05,280 --> 01:14:06,280
It was about that.

1794
01:14:06,280 --> 01:14:09,280
Literally that situation we just described.

1795
01:14:09,280 --> 01:14:12,280
MC Usher, MC Usher, MC Hammer, and the other one.

1796
01:14:12,280 --> 01:14:14,280
Fucking in a fiery inferno.

1797
01:14:14,280 --> 01:14:19,280
Can you make your Sim look like a nun?

1798
01:14:19,280 --> 01:14:21,280
Is that a possibility?

1799
01:14:21,280 --> 01:14:26,280
I mean, you can, and it'll just make it more scintillating when that nun breaks the habit, if you know what I mean.

1800
01:14:26,280 --> 01:14:30,280
I mean, she takes all of her clothes off.

1801
01:14:30,280 --> 01:14:33,280
When she takes off her clothes, she's not a nun anymore.

1802
01:14:33,280 --> 01:14:34,280
Come on, Griffin.

1803
01:14:34,280 --> 01:14:36,280
I guess you're right, that's how it works.

1804
01:14:36,280 --> 01:14:38,280
That's why all nuns stink like shit.

1805
01:14:38,280 --> 01:14:42,280
It's true.

1806
01:14:42,280 --> 01:14:45,280
You ever seen a nun just walk through the car wash?

1807
01:14:45,280 --> 01:14:46,280
Man, I want to play some Sims now.

1808
01:14:46,280 --> 01:14:47,280
Yeah, I know, right?

1809
01:14:47,280 --> 01:14:49,280
Do you guys remember Sims Online?

1810
01:14:49,280 --> 01:14:50,280
That shit was fucked up.

1811
01:14:50,280 --> 01:14:54,280
Yeah, it was real fucked up, because that game was like The Sims.

1812
01:14:54,280 --> 01:14:56,280
Everyone's trying to fuck, but guess what?

1813
01:14:56,280 --> 01:14:59,280
There's people on the other end, real life people.

1814
01:14:59,280 --> 01:15:00,280
Hello.

1815
01:15:00,280 --> 01:15:01,280
Hello, how are you?

1816
01:15:01,280 --> 01:15:02,280
Good to meet you.

1817
01:15:02,280 --> 01:15:03,280
Oh, internet?

1818
01:15:03,280 --> 01:15:04,280
Sure.

1819
01:15:04,280 --> 01:15:05,280
Fuck me.

1820
01:15:05,280 --> 01:15:06,280
I fucked you.

1821
01:15:06,280 --> 01:15:07,280
We did it for real.

1822
01:15:07,280 --> 01:15:08,280
If you fuck in the game, you fuck in real life.

1823
01:15:08,280 --> 01:15:11,280
The Sims Online, brought to you by EA.

1824
01:15:11,280 --> 01:15:15,280
You're going to love fucking the internet.

1825
01:15:15,280 --> 01:15:18,280
It's like EverQuest, but it's going to leave you bone dry.

1826
01:15:18,280 --> 01:15:20,280
Folks, that's going to do it for us.

1827
01:15:20,280 --> 01:15:25,280
Thank you so much to, well, I mean, John Roderick, but we thank you every week.

1828
01:15:25,280 --> 01:15:26,280
Right.

1829
01:15:26,280 --> 01:15:33,280
Triple thanks, with sugar, to John Roderick for joining us on this program.

1830
01:15:33,280 --> 01:15:38,280
We haven't recorded that interview yet, so I hope he has lived to this point to actually record it.

1831
01:15:38,280 --> 01:15:44,280
Well, more likely, I hope we don't fucking pee our pants, and then you can hear the pee in the recording.

1832
01:15:44,280 --> 01:15:46,280
So thank you to him.

1833
01:15:46,280 --> 01:15:48,280
Thank you to you for listening to the program.

1834
01:15:48,280 --> 01:15:50,280
You can follow John Roderick.

1835
01:15:50,280 --> 01:15:52,280
We probably did the plugs, didn't we?

1836
01:15:52,280 --> 01:15:53,280
Do you think?

1837
01:15:53,280 --> 01:15:54,280
In the past?

1838
01:15:54,280 --> 01:15:55,280
In the past?

1839
01:15:55,280 --> 01:15:57,280
Our future selves?

1840
01:15:57,280 --> 01:16:01,280
We should mention again to go to BoatParty.biz.

1841
01:16:01,280 --> 01:16:02,280
Think about it.

1842
01:16:02,280 --> 01:16:06,280
Think about it real hard, because it's going to be a goddamn slam dunk.

1843
01:16:06,280 --> 01:16:17,280
Thanks to people tweeting about the show, like Jesse, Don Chappell, Epinards and Caramel, so many others.

1844
01:16:17,280 --> 01:16:19,280
You're all fantastic.

1845
01:16:19,280 --> 01:16:25,280
And we haven't, I don't know that we've ever mentioned this, but if you'd like to get some more information

1846
01:16:25,280 --> 01:16:30,280
or see pictures from Live Show and everything, check out our Facebook group, My Brother, My Brother, and Me.

1847
01:16:30,280 --> 01:16:31,280
Go check it out.

1848
01:16:31,280 --> 01:16:32,280
Yeah, get there.

1849
01:16:32,280 --> 01:16:33,280
Hey, we have one of those.

1850
01:16:33,280 --> 01:16:41,280
If you are going to be at our LA Live Show next week, a week from fuck, in like four days, goddamn it.

1851
01:16:41,280 --> 01:16:43,280
Please send us a question.

1852
01:16:43,280 --> 01:16:46,280
Let us know that you're going to be there so we can call you out.

1853
01:16:46,280 --> 01:16:50,280
And then let's get some mad bro grabs going afterwards.

1854
01:16:50,280 --> 01:16:51,280
Let's get it going.

1855
01:16:51,280 --> 01:16:52,280
Let's get it popping.

1856
01:16:52,280 --> 01:16:53,280
And that's going to do it for us here.

1857
01:16:53,280 --> 01:16:55,280
My Brother, My Brother, Me, Griffin, you got a last question for us.

1858
01:16:55,280 --> 01:16:56,280
Got this final one.

1859
01:16:56,280 --> 01:16:58,280
Please let's send the other MaxFun shows too.

1860
01:16:58,280 --> 01:16:59,280
MaxFunFun.org.

1861
01:16:59,280 --> 01:17:00,280
So many good ones.

1862
01:17:00,280 --> 01:17:01,280
All right.

1863
01:17:01,280 --> 01:17:02,280
Final question.

1864
01:17:02,280 --> 01:17:03,280
Yahoo was sent in by Zach Bomb.

1865
01:17:03,280 --> 01:17:04,280
Thank you, Zach.

1866
01:17:04,280 --> 01:17:11,280
It's by Yahoo Answers user Erica, who asks, oh, what is a marijuana nugget?

1867
01:17:11,280 --> 01:17:14,280
I'm Justin McElroy.

1868
01:17:14,280 --> 01:17:15,280
I'm Travis McElroy.

1869
01:17:15,280 --> 01:17:16,280
I'm Griffin McElroy.

1870
01:17:16,280 --> 01:17:17,280
This has been My Brother, My Brother, and Me.

1871
01:17:17,280 --> 01:17:18,280
Kiss your dad.

1872
01:17:18,280 --> 01:17:19,280
Square on the lips.

1873
01:17:19,280 --> 01:17:20,280
Thanks.

1874
01:17:20,280 --> 01:17:39,800
MaxFunFun.org.

1875
01:17:39,800 --> 01:17:40,800
Comedy and culture.

1876
01:17:40,800 --> 01:17:41,800
Artist owned.

1877
01:17:41,800 --> 01:17:43,760
Listener supported.

1878
01:17:43,760 --> 01:17:45,640
Have you made vacation plans yet?

1879
01:17:45,640 --> 01:17:50,380
The second annual Atlantic Ocean Comedy and Music Festival is ready to set sail this summer,

1880
01:17:50,380 --> 01:17:52,720
and we want to see you on board.

1881
01:17:52,720 --> 01:17:57,400
Imagine amazing comedians, stellar music, and beautiful Caribbean views.

1882
01:17:57,400 --> 01:18:03,920
It all takes place July 25th through 28th, en route to Nassau, The Bahamas.

1883
01:18:03,920 --> 01:18:08,340
And frankly, we've impressed even ourselves with this lineup of bullseye favorites.

1884
01:18:08,340 --> 01:18:09,480
You've got Moshe Kasher.

1885
01:18:09,480 --> 01:18:11,280
I was in an airport recently.

1886
01:18:11,280 --> 01:18:16,440
You ever see somebody and you're just like, oh, so you're what's wrong with everything

1887
01:18:16,440 --> 01:18:17,440
in the world?

1888
01:18:17,440 --> 01:18:18,440
Kyle Kinane.

1889
01:18:18,440 --> 01:18:21,500
Anybody else in here get so drunk last month you had to call a cab just to take you to

1890
01:18:21,500 --> 01:18:23,760
Wendy's?

1891
01:18:23,760 --> 01:18:25,620
W. Kamau Bell.

1892
01:18:25,620 --> 01:18:29,440
So complicated, my feelings.

1893
01:18:29,440 --> 01:18:30,440
Morgan Murphy.

1894
01:18:30,440 --> 01:18:33,080
I don't know if you guys know what a facelift is.

1895
01:18:33,080 --> 01:18:38,920
When they take your face skin and they peel it away from your face, and in that little
