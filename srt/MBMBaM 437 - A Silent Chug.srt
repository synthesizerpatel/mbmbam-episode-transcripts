1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:30,800
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:47,120
Hello, everybody, and welcome to My Brother, My Brother, Me,

6
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:51,840
an advice show for the modern era. I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy.

7
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:55,440
I'm your middle-est brother, Travis McElroy.

8
00:00:55,440 --> 00:01:02,240
I'm your sweet baby brother, 30 under 30 boy, Griffin McElroy.

9
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:06,720
I came up with a theme for this opening bit.

10
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:07,760
Okay, go for it.

11
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:08,560
Do it again, sorry.

12
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:12,320
I just, I won't do it if you guys-

13
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:14,640
No, rip it, rip that shit.

14
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:16,160
Do it. Grip it and rip it.

15
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:17,760
Okay.

16
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:22,960
You got your problems. Whoa, I got my eyes wide.

17
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:28,720
Oh, you got your big Gs. I got my smash pipe.

18
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:31,040
This is smash pipe.

19
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:32,000
Wait, hold on.

20
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:37,520
It's where we take, it's a Smash Brothers dispatch direct from us to you.

21
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:44,000
I don't think it counts as fair use, Justin, if you just change cash to smash.

22
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,600
I don't think that counts as a parody.

23
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:51,440
Travis, listen, there's no amount of licensing fees I would not pay to keep that great joke

24
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:54,480
in the beginning of our episode of our podcast.

25
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:55,120
Okay.

26
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:56,960
Welcome to Smash Pipe, everyone.

27
00:01:56,960 --> 00:02:03,920
Light it up and huff this great news and strategies and cheat codes for Super Smash Brothers Ultimate.

28
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:06,880
Can I start it off with a little cheat?

29
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:10,800
That also is going to include my favorite character to play as.

30
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:12,480
Go for it, please.

31
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:17,200
If you scroll all the way up in the character creation screen, I mean, just keep holding up

32
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:19,840
way past when it seems like there's no further to go up.

33
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:25,520
You can eventually select the pencil from the NES game anticipation.

34
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:26,480
Fucking great.

35
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:28,240
And you can play as the pencil.

36
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:31,200
Do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do.

37
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:32,320
Fuck, it's so good.

38
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:33,280
Such a good game.

39
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:39,520
What he does is he draws a cube around the other players and then they can't escape from that cube.

40
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:40,320
That's pretty good.

41
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:41,920
It takes forever, though.

42
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:43,040
You have to wait.

43
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:45,360
That hints the anticipation.

44
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:46,480
Justin, you got me.

45
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:49,360
Who's your favorite characters and strategies in cheat codes?

46
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:51,360
And cheat codes from Super Smash Brothers.

47
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:54,720
I have a cheat code that I'd like to lay out.

48
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:56,480
My favorite character is Seaman.

49
00:02:56,480 --> 00:03:01,280
He can't do anything because they won't have pure water stages.

50
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:05,680
So Seaman just lays on the ground and complains at you until you throw him back.

51
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:07,840
But then it's like, ring out.

52
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:10,320
So that's a loss every time.

53
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:11,360
It's a guaranteed loss.

54
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:14,240
But it's a challenging character with a lot of different dimensions.

55
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:23,360
And my cheat code is that if you press A three times in a row at any point while you're playing the game,

56
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:28,880
you will get a refund check from Reggie Fils-Aime from his personal checking account.

57
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:29,200
Wow.

58
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:31,040
And that is true.

59
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:33,040
Does the game self-delete at that point?

60
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:42,240
The game self-deletes and it wipes your hard drive of any, in your memory, of Smash Brothers.

61
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:45,840
And it doesn't even give you like an, are you sure you want to do this kind of command?

62
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:46,560
No, no.

63
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:49,440
If you press the A button three times,

64
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:53,200
you get a refund check from Reggie Fils-Aime's personal checking account.

65
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:53,600
That's good.

66
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:57,600
Your mind is erased of all Smash Brothers secrets and content

67
00:03:57,600 --> 00:04:00,320
and also the middle names of everyone you know and love.

68
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:01,520
That's good.

69
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:06,000
Well, my favorite character is Tony Shalhoub in Super Smash Brothers Ultimate.

70
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,480
And my cheat code, he's the best, first of all.

71
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:11,040
He's a great edge defender and he's easier to wave dash.

72
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:16,720
But my cheat code is, obviously, the character has lots of costumes.

73
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:17,200
Mm-hmm.

74
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:21,920
Red Monk, Blue Monk, they're all sort of variations on Monk, Electric Monk.

75
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:25,040
But you know how the Switch has Amiibos?

76
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:25,760
Uh-huh.

77
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:28,640
It's delightful new creation from Nintendo that blends both toy and game alike.

78
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:33,040
If you scan Amiibos on it, you can earn unlocks, as we call them in the business.

79
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:41,600
If you can find Tony Shalhoub in real life and swipe his face across your Switch,

80
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:44,400
it'll unlock the Antonio Scarpacci skin.

81
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:45,040
Whoa.

82
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:46,000
That's huge.

83
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:51,760
My favorite character is the big scary moon from Majora's Mask.

84
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:53,440
Yeah, well, yeah, big one.

85
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:55,600
And you crash into the whole screen.

86
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:57,600
I'll tell you my favorite character.

87
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:59,600
I'll tell you my favorite character.

88
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:01,600
My favorite character.

89
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:08,960
My favorite character is Bowser the Third.

90
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:10,720
He's Bowser Jr.'s son.

91
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:14,560
Bowser Jr. first appeared in 2002, Super Mario Sunshine.

92
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:15,920
He's a team dad.

93
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:22,720
Bowser Jr. is now a team dad, a 16-year-old team dad of his son, a baby named Bowser the Third.

94
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:27,920
He's Bowser Jr.'s son, and he's a great new character in the game Super Smash Brothers Ultimate.

95
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:30,800
I like Donkey Dong.

96
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:36,880
I'm just bananas for Donkey Dong.

97
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:38,640
I like Donkey Duck.

98
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:41,360
He's in there, too, from the good place.

99
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:42,480
That character from the good place.

100
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:44,320
All the good place characters are in it.

101
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:45,040
They're in there.

102
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:47,200
Back for another round.

103
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:48,240
They're all in there.

104
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:50,080
Can you play as Mario?

105
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:54,160
No, so we've done pretty much all of the video game jokes for 2019.

106
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:54,800
Sorry, gang.

107
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:56,000
We looked at the ledger.

108
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:00,720
We realized that we had a large budget of video game jokes that we hadn't told,

109
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:06,400
and now that we've ostracized the sort of non-ludological members of our audience,

110
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:08,080
maybe we get into our core compasses.

111
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:10,880
2019, we're going to get back to video games.

112
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:16,560
That's who raised us, who supped us at their proverbial breast, and we are here.

113
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:18,000
Not proverbial, no.

114
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:18,480
Not proverbial.

115
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:20,400
Mario's literal breast.

116
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:22,400
I supped on Mario.

117
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:23,440
I drank the game milk.

118
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:28,720
The game milk for the special game cow that we've supped on grew us to where we are today,

119
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:29,840
so we're really excited.

120
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:35,440
I'd love to get back to my Wii U so I could play more Smash Brothers Ultimate right now,

121
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:37,600
but I can't because I got to do this podcast.

122
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:39,600
We could do both at the same time.

123
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:42,640
Oh, man, that might be a good streaming thing that people could watch.

124
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:45,040
You know if we were going to do that, Travis, you know where people could find it?

125
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:51,040
Our YouTube channel or on our website, themacaroy.family?

126
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:52,400
Yes, that's the one, Travis.

127
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:54,400
Our YouTube channel is just called Macaroy Family.

128
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:55,680
We finally have a website, folks.

129
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:57,360
That's just too exciting to wait for the end of the show.

130
00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:00,000
We have a website, believe it or not.

131
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:00,720
We did it.

132
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:03,200
We set up our GeoCities account, finally.

133
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:05,600
That's in partnership with Vox.

134
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:07,600
They're helping us with the website.

135
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:11,360
If you ever watched Monster Factory from me and Griff, that's here.

136
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:15,040
A new episode there on our channel, the Macaroy Family.

137
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:19,760
For some bizarre reason, there's also the episodes I did of Carry On,

138
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:23,440
a journey through the cinematic career of Jim Carrey starting at the beginning.

139
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:24,160
I beg you not to put that on there.

140
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:24,960
This is a bug.

141
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:26,080
This is a bug.

142
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:28,800
This is a bug, and we will get it worked out by the time this episode comes out.

143
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:32,000
If I get enough positive feedback, maybe I'll record the next one.

144
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,600
I still haven't done Once Bitten.

145
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:35,360
That's the next one in the chronological order.

146
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:40,640
I only got like four movies into what I assume is like 50-some movies that man has done.

147
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:45,680
So if you want me to keep going reviewing Jim Carrey movies, go to themacaroy.family,

148
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:48,720
click on videos, watch some Carry On, let me know what you think.

149
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:53,040
That's the new home of Carry On, macaroy.family.

150
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:53,600
Go check it out.

151
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:54,640
There's lots of other stuff there.

152
00:07:54,640 --> 00:08:01,120
But if you like it, we hope you'll bookmark it and make it your homepage and the only page.

153
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:05,760
It's also a search engine, as long as the only thing you need is our content.

154
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:10,480
Let's get into some advice because I have missed helping people

155
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:18,720
while I've been busy joining this hot, extremely stable world of digital media websites.

156
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:20,240
So excited to get into it finally.

157
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:23,920
But let's help some people, all right?

158
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:24,800
Is that okay?

159
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:26,480
Just yes, go, just do it, go.

160
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:27,840
Yeah, you don't need our permission.

161
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:32,720
Today I learned that next week, the office team I'm part of

162
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:37,040
is going to be going paintballing as a form of team bonding.

163
00:08:37,040 --> 00:08:40,800
I'm very excited by this since I've always wanted to go paintballing

164
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:44,480
and I'm also very competitive in nature.

165
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:50,240
However, everyone that will be there is either my boss or someone who has worked at my office

166
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:54,320
much longer than I have since I was only just hired at the beginning of the year.

167
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:57,760
I'm worried about getting into the game and maybe shooting some people I really shouldn't.

168
00:08:57,760 --> 00:08:58,800
What should I do?

169
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:02,320
Any advice on the best level of competitiveness I should try to achieve?

170
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:07,120
And that's from Concerned and Competitive in Kalamasa.

171
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:10,400
Well, I mean, you got your squeegee?

172
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:12,080
You got your squeegee ready?

173
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:15,040
Oh, no, Griffin.

174
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:15,760
What's wrong?

175
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:16,240
Is that your...

176
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:23,280
My watch just heard the entirety of that question and would love to weigh in on it.

177
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:23,840
Sorry, watch.

178
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:26,080
It said, I'm not sure I understand.

179
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:27,040
Yeah, no shit, watch.

180
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:27,840
Yeah, dude.

181
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:28,480
Calm down.

182
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:29,840
Daddy's trying to record, okay?

183
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:35,680
I think that you should go full four.

184
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:36,720
I think that this is...

185
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:43,920
We, as humans, many of us have been fortunate enough to not have to taste of battle.

186
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:51,520
And this is a time to find if something will be awoken within you that maybe the person

187
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:58,640
that gets the sandwiches can then be the lord of murder with so much blood on their hands.

188
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:03,440
And from then on, when they get their sandwiches from you, they will know it's from death himself

189
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:06,080
is coming, is getting the sandwiches today.

190
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:07,440
Do they make blood balls?

191
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:11,520
Just like full blown just blood balls.

192
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:19,280
So that the feeling of the war horniness, you can really feel it.

193
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:22,080
The warniness, so it can really just kick in.

194
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:23,840
All you have to do, this is easy.

195
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:32,080
All you have to do is make sure you're on whoever the head boss is on their team, because

196
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:37,600
then you go hard and they're like, one, I appreciate your commitment.

197
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:41,680
Two, I appreciate how you just paintball murdered everyone in accounting.

198
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:45,600
Just spend the entire game leaping in front of your boss and yelling no.

199
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:51,200
Eventually, someone is going to shoot you while you're doing that.

200
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:54,320
They can't legally, they can't fire you at that point.

201
00:10:56,480 --> 00:11:03,120
It is wild in this particular climate of 2018 where it's like, I feel like, and rightly

202
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:09,600
so, people are a lot more plugged in to how to make everyone feel comfortable in a working

203
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:13,520
environment and sort of where those lines are because they had been so very blurred

204
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:19,520
for so long, except this Saturday, we're all going to fucking blaze each other with

205
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:25,760
extremely painful guns and there will be people who feel targeted because they're literally

206
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:32,480
100% being targeted by our extremely painful yet non-lethal weaponry.

207
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:33,920
That's crazy.

208
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:40,000
Do you live in the one state where like, I don't know where Calamity is, probably in

209
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,120
California, it seems.

210
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:45,840
Do you not have laser tag within a hundred mile radius of you?

211
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:50,640
Because it's like paintball, but with like nachos and no paint.

212
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:52,400
You gotta feel it, Trev.

213
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:57,680
I can't feel a laser and they try to make the vest vibrate and that does not set off

214
00:11:57,680 --> 00:11:59,200
my war horniness.

215
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:02,080
I need it to be, I need the feeling.

216
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:06,320
Can I make a suggestion to you that's different from the suggestions we've put forward so

217
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:06,720
far?

218
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:07,280
Please do.

219
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:11,520
You're on your team and there's an enemy team, maybe you're playing capture the flag,

220
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:13,920
maybe you're just playing a good old team death match.

221
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:18,720
You leave your team immediately, run away from as fast as you can, head into the woods.

222
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:22,560
In there, you're gonna find the ghillie suit that you planted the previous night and you're

223
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:23,520
gonna climb into that.

224
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:30,160
You're gonna find the $500 sniper paintball rifle that you bought on the dark web and

225
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:37,600
then you're just gonna start taking people out, sort of agnostic of team, just sort of

226
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:38,640
away from team.

227
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:40,240
You are going to be-

228
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:41,280
You're going rogue.

229
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:42,640
You're going to be predator.

230
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:48,480
You're gonna have two long sort of paint rollers that are gonna shoot out of your wrists like,

231
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:52,720
you know, wrist mounted blades that you're gonna cover in paint and hit people with them

232
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:55,440
but when they turn to look at what hit them, you're already gone.

233
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:58,160
And then they're gonna call a ref and be like, is this legal?

234
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:00,000
Is this legal?

235
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,360
You hit me with a paint roller.

236
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:03,360
You should tell people you're not gonna come.

237
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:09,680
Tell them that you'd love to make it but you're gonna be on vacation in Petaluma and send

238
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:13,840
them pictures, like set up your phone, you can probably get like an automated script

239
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:18,080
to do this sort of thing, like text everybody at your office mid-match, like having a great

240
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:22,080
time here in Petaluma, wish you were here, wish I could be there, hope y'all are being

241
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:22,800
safe out there.

242
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:27,040
And then like while they're checking your text, dead.

243
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:27,440
What's that?

244
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:29,120
You're triangulating the signal.

245
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:30,640
You used it.

246
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:33,360
Oh, you heard their message tones go off.

247
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:37,040
You come up from the ground, you just splatoon them from the inside out.

248
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:37,680
I love it.

249
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:39,840
Add everybody in your office.

250
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:42,640
Say, hey, listen, I'd love to keep track of the fun.

251
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:44,160
Can I add you on Find My Friends?

252
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:49,520
Before, I'd love to keep track of all the fun everybody's having and then like, how

253
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:50,880
does he know where I am?

254
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:51,520
Oh, that's great.

255
00:13:51,520 --> 00:13:52,880
You send them that picture, right?

256
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:54,720
And then they text back like, looks great.

257
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:56,240
What's that?

258
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:59,520
It sounded like that message alert came from right behind me.

259
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:01,460
Good.

260
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:03,680
Hey, can I read y'all a Yahoo?

261
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:04,240
Yes, please.

262
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:05,840
No, but do just have fun out there.

263
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:06,880
Yeah, just have a lot of fun.

264
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:09,520
You won't because it's the most exhausting activity.

265
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:14,960
Yeah, maybe just let yourself get shot and go to like the concession stand and have like

266
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:16,000
ice cream cone or something.

267
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:16,480
Something.

268
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:19,040
Addie sent this one and thank you, Addie.

269
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:23,600
It's a Yahoo answers user who has chosen to remain anonymous and I respect their choice

270
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:24,640
so they will get no name.

271
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:33,440
They ask, if I break a wishbone by myself, right hand versus left hand, will I get my wish?

272
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:36,640
My husband always gets the larger part of the wishbone.

273
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:37,360
Always.

274
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:39,440
And consequently gets his wish.

275
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:43,600
He's wished for and received trips, cars, money, even a dog.

276
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:46,160
Let me start over.

277
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:51,280
He's wished for and received trips, cars, money, even a dog, which magically showed up

278
00:14:51,280 --> 00:14:53,600
after he got the bigger part of the wishbone.

279
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:56,080
I, on the other hand, have gotten nothing.

280
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:58,480
So I've decided to break the wishbone by myself.

281
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:01,680
The right hand will have one wish and the left hand will have a different wish.

282
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:10,640
My, my, my husband says it is the means of distribution of the two wishes to your two

283
00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:13,200
discreet hands is something I'm very curious about.

284
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:17,040
If you whisper it into your closed fist and try not to let it escape.

285
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:22,000
Anyway, my husband says it is totally against the wishbone quote rules and I'll end up putting

286
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,480
a hex on all our future wishbone endeavors.

287
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:27,600
Can anyone offer any insight on the wishbone dilemma?

288
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:29,520
I sure can offer insight.

289
00:15:29,520 --> 00:15:34,320
Your husband wants to buy himself trips and cars and dogs and stuff and he's already done

290
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:39,040
it and then he rigs the wishbone so that he wins and then he's like, I didn't buy it,

291
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:40,960
I need the wishbone, brought the car.

292
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:44,480
It's a complicated pulley system that he has attached to the back of his belt.

293
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:46,800
He wins the wishbone, he starts walking backwards.

294
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:50,480
The pulley releases the dog suspended from the ceiling.

295
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:51,280
Miracle dog.

296
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:52,560
Thank you, wishbone.

297
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:56,800
And your husband knows that if you were to break it yourself, you would blow this whole

298
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:58,000
thing wide open.

299
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:01,600
Yeah, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep.

300
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:05,760
I am not a vegetarian, obviously, I love meat.

301
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:09,840
We have time to make this kind of revelation, Justin, but go on.

302
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:16,080
Yeah, this is one I'm not sure I could explain to turkeys.

303
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:17,440
It's a secret.

304
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:22,720
If turkeys did decide to ask me like, are you sure about this, about the whole thing?

305
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:25,200
I would say like, yeah, I get it.

306
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:27,600
Like, I need to eat you for sustenance.

307
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:31,840
And they're like, okay, but what about the part where you wait for my dad's neck bone

308
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:39,040
to dry and then you and your dad grab it and fight over it and break it in front of me

309
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:42,080
and then make a wish on my dad's dried bones?

310
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:42,480
As you said-

311
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:48,000
What I can only call like a macabre sacrifice to your hope that, I don't know, your favorite

312
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,600
football team wins or something.

313
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:50,480
Something.

314
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:53,040
Like it could, it's, it's ghoulish.

315
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:55,360
I would have a hard time.

316
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:59,360
Like you didn't even call it by the bone that it is in the turkey.

317
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:01,280
You're calling it a wishbone.

318
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:01,920
Wink.

319
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:02,560
Nope.

320
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:03,200
It's not.

321
00:17:03,760 --> 00:17:05,040
It's not that.

322
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:08,560
This, I couldn't stop thinking about this when I was looking at this Yahoo.

323
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:14,400
This thought of like, you know how in like cartoons and like some fantasy shit, there's

324
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:21,360
like ogres or like the Uruk-hai in the Lord of the Rings movies where you look at them

325
00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:26,240
and they like just fucking tear a little goblin apart and start gnawing on its bones and you

326
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:29,120
see that and you're like, barbaric.

327
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:34,800
That's kind of what we do with the turkey's neck every year it seems like a little bit.

328
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:38,800
It's kind of, maybe now we're the, we're the barbarians.

329
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:43,200
I mean there was a moment, this was my first year making a turkey, roasting a turkey for

330
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:49,520
Thanksgiving and I did at one point put it on my hand like a Muppet and I thought that

331
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:54,480
was very funny, not thinking about the fact that at one point it was a living being who

332
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:55,360
probably had friends.

333
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:59,680
So does the wish come true if you do it by yourself?

334
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:04,560
Let's, I want to return to the idea of individual wish deployment.

335
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:06,640
Do you write it on your palms?

336
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:10,960
Do you hold it in your hand like a little butterfly and try not to let the wish go away?

337
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:14,960
Do you have one wish that you clearly prefer, right?

338
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:19,200
And maybe that's how the wishbone magic continues is one of the wishes is like, I get a check

339
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:24,320
for, you know, $10,000 and the other one is like, you know, I don't lose my car keys for

340
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:27,920
the rest of the year, which you want the money, but either one's a wish.

341
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:33,120
It's gotta be a blind, a double blind kind of thing where like you put a whole bunch

342
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:37,760
of wishes in a bowl, you draw two out, you put them in your shoes, you put the shoes

343
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:39,200
on, you don't look.

344
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:39,840
Maybe.

345
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:40,160
Right?

346
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:45,440
You can't, like literally the right hand can't know what the left hand is doing, right?

347
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:47,920
Or, and, but here's the thing.

348
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:53,120
What you do, and this is what they don't tell you, you run the risk of the wishbone

349
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:55,920
splitting perfectly in half and you die.

350
00:18:55,920 --> 00:18:56,320
Yeah.

351
00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:57,360
That's what it would do.

352
00:18:57,360 --> 00:18:57,680
Wow.

353
00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:00,240
The genie comes out, strangles you.

354
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:00,800
Yes.

355
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:02,720
If that kind of power was unleashed.

356
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:08,240
There's a genie just sort of riding around inside of every turkey's neck just waiting

357
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:09,200
for his chance.

358
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:09,700
Yep.

359
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:13,040
He's like, hey, I have a wish.

360
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:17,520
As long as, as long as my neck can grant wishes, you know the wish that I have?

361
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:18,960
Can you guess?

362
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:23,760
Do you think if a turkey like has an accident, an escape or something, and breaks its neck,

363
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:24,640
it gets its wish?

364
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:26,080
Oh, I wish I don't die.

365
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:27,120
Oh, shit.

366
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:27,920
Whoa.

367
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:28,880
I'm fine.

368
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:30,320
That's how they discovered it.

369
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:33,120
Then we started harvesting them for their wish powers.

370
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:34,960
And then we found out they were also delicious.

371
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:36,080
They're awesome to eat.

372
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:40,880
We should do something with the rest of this bird and not just use this one bone.

373
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:41,360
You're right.

374
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:42,160
Thank you, Todd.

375
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:43,600
Thank you for saying what we're all thinking.

376
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:45,440
This is extremely wasteful.

377
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:47,360
We're just digging this magic bone out.

378
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:50,320
There's got to be a better way.

379
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:54,480
Well, I mean, it definitely if you got to think of this Occam's razor style.

380
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:56,720
They see a turkey doing rad skateboard tricks.

381
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:59,920
It has a tragic fall, snaps its neck, but then it gets back up.

382
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:00,880
A wish has been granted.

383
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:01,680
It's fine.

384
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:03,440
I don't think the next step is eat it.

385
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:08,000
I think the next step is let's explore the magical possibilities of the rest of the bones

386
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:08,800
in this creature.

387
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:13,680
That's like if, you know, if you saw Superman be invincible, your first thought wouldn't be,

388
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:14,720
let's eat him.

389
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:18,400
You would get there eventually, but you'd probably be like, we should study him.

390
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:25,920
Can you use your losing bone shard to stab your husband right in the neck and then you

391
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:30,560
claim his winning bone shard and the wish he wanted?

392
00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:34,560
Oh, what if his wish was to lose at the wish bone?

393
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:36,400
Oh, damn.

394
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:37,360
I know this riddle.

395
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:42,080
You have to ask one of the wish bones what the other one will say.

396
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:44,560
Yeah, how about a question?

397
00:20:44,560 --> 00:20:45,600
I would love that.

398
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:51,680
My boss and I were talking one day and she told me about her favorite candy bar, which

399
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:53,280
she said is very hard to find.

400
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:57,040
The next day, I discovered that my local grocery store happens to carry said candy bar.

401
00:20:57,040 --> 00:20:58,800
So I bought her one as a surprise.

402
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:02,640
I gave it to her the next day and she seemed genuinely excited.

403
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:05,840
But then she stashed the candy bar in the freezer at my workstation.

404
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:09,520
Oh, it's been a week and the candy bar is still in the freezer.

405
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:10,560
Flowsers.

406
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:11,520
Can I eat it?

407
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:14,960
Oh, I didn't expect the question to end like that.

408
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:15,440
Me neither.

409
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:17,520
I expected it to be like, hey, what should I do?

410
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:20,480
Because she's not enjoying my gift the way I envisioned.

411
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:23,840
That's from a clever, alliterated name in New York City.

412
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:26,500
Huh.

413
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:28,340
Yeah.

414
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:29,380
No.

415
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:30,740
Justin?

416
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:33,300
Yeah?

417
00:21:33,300 --> 00:21:34,400
Split the wish bone.

418
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:36,080
Split the, split the wish bone.

419
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:37,940
No.

420
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:38,900
Yeah.

421
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:44,320
To be fair, when I said yeah, that was, I was referring to the stumpedness of you two.

422
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:45,200
Oh, I see.

423
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:47,120
Not me saying, yes, eat.

424
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:52,960
Because this, if I gave someone a lovely candy bar and they put it on a shelf, perhaps to

425
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:56,560
display it, I wouldn't then say, well, you missed your window.

426
00:21:56,560 --> 00:21:58,240
It's mine again now.

427
00:21:58,240 --> 00:21:58,880
And eat it.

428
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:02,000
It is, I will say two things.

429
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:07,520
One, it's not necessarily a dunk on your candy bar gift.

430
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:12,400
Some people do like, like, listen, there's a lot of candy I love and I could secure because

431
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:13,600
I'm a grown man.

432
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:19,360
But I'm not gonna go out and secure it because if I eat that kind of sugar, that's my week,

433
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:19,860
gang.

434
00:22:19,860 --> 00:22:20,960
That's it, man.

435
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:24,880
A Snickers bar would put me in the fucking hospital.

436
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:25,380
I can't.

437
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:27,600
I love your candy gift.

438
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:28,960
Are you trying to kill me?

439
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:31,520
Because I'm gonna eat this and then I'm gonna go home and be like, well,

440
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:34,880
that's my whole day and eat an entire box of Lucky Charms.

441
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:36,960
And then I'll say that's my whole week and that's it.

442
00:22:37,680 --> 00:22:40,800
Yeah, well, let me tell, I would like to take this one step further, right?

443
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:43,840
Your boss said it's hard to find.

444
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:44,880
You found one.

445
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:46,640
What's she supposed to do?

446
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:48,960
Just go ahead and eat that on any old day of the week?

447
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:50,240
No, it's special.

448
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:50,640
It's gotta be special.

449
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:52,560
It's a hard to find candy bar.

450
00:22:52,560 --> 00:22:57,680
She is saving it for when you guys, I don't know, land the big account or whatever and

451
00:22:57,680 --> 00:22:59,120
save the business.

452
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:00,080
Or the big meteor.

453
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:01,200
The big meteor is gonna fall.

454
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:04,560
When the big meteor is gonna fall and you land the big meteor and save the business.

455
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:10,000
You blow up the big meteor and save the business and everybody else on planet earth.

456
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:14,400
And they're like, hey, you did it, digital media startup company.

457
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:18,560
You say you destroyed that meteor because it was easier to train you to be astronauts

458
00:23:18,560 --> 00:23:21,680
than train astronauts to be digital media executives or whatever.

459
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:24,000
I'm not done.

460
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:27,280
You blow up the meteor and then candy bar time.

461
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:28,080
Okay, now I'm done.

462
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:32,000
I have to share with you all this visceral reaction I'm having to this question.

463
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:37,360
I can't explain why it's so powerful, but since we have started discussing it, I can't

464
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:42,640
I can't stop thinking about and imagining and envisioning so much so that I feel like

465
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:49,680
it's actually happening in my actual mouth and body, the thought of eating a Three Musketeers

466
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:54,960
bar like now, like a king size Three Musketeers bar now as a 31 year old adult.

467
00:23:54,960 --> 00:24:00,960
Just the feeling of gomming down all of that sweet nougat and like what that would feel like, taste like.

468
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:02,960
Is that a pleasant feeling in your experience?

469
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:04,560
No, no, no, it's quite bad, quite bad.

470
00:24:04,560 --> 00:24:08,560
I'm saying in trying to ingest that truck bed full of nougat.

471
00:24:08,560 --> 00:24:10,720
I'm just envisioning what it would like.

472
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:14,880
I it's obviously it's a fancy fantasy land if I actually try to do that.

473
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:20,240
Like I would need to be standing in front of my own open grave just kind of topple over into it.

474
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:23,280
I'm just thinking about trying to get all that nougat down.

475
00:24:23,280 --> 00:24:26,000
It's like a fucking survivor challenge in my mind.

476
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:33,520
Sometimes I think about this, how I do this where I'll open a candy bar, I will eat, let's say, a third of it

477
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:38,240
and then kind of fold the wrapper back over it and place it somewhere.

478
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:44,480
And I just picture like nine year old Travis just like crying and weeping at what I have become.

479
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:50,960
Like you can't finish a candy, like we took BB trick-or-treating, which means I got a lot of candy.

480
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:56,480
And like the fun-sized bars, I was like, oh, thank God.

481
00:24:56,480 --> 00:25:00,560
But for me, those are not even fun-sized anymore.

482
00:25:00,560 --> 00:25:05,680
What would be fun-sized is like a little amuse-bouche of Snickers served out of a tiny spoon.

483
00:25:05,680 --> 00:25:07,440
Give me that technology, Marsh.

484
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:11,040
When I was a young man and I was selling candy for a fundraiser

485
00:25:11,040 --> 00:25:16,480
and I sold a packet of Skittles to my Spanish professor, Senora Berry.

486
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:24,320
And upon the next arrival at the beginning of class, she told me how much she enjoyed the Skittles.

487
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:28,400
And then she told me she had to cut the Skittles in half because they were so extremely sweet.

488
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:32,320
And friends, I'm here to tell you, I'm saying this with a lot of shame in my heart.

489
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:36,000
I laughed in her face that day, that Dia, if you will.

490
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:41,600
And I feel a lot of regret about that because at this point in my life, I get it, Senora Berry.

491
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:45,920
I'm sorry if you're out there listening. Thank you so much. I'm sorry for laughing at you.

492
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:50,400
Now I'm experiencing deja vu because either we've talked about that explicitly on this show before

493
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:52,640
or somebody just changed something in The Matrix.

494
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:58,240
When I was a kid, I sold candy bars for band and they were those kind of like,

495
00:25:58,240 --> 00:26:01,600
not name brand, just kind of silver with a white wrapper.

496
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:04,240
And some kind of like, it just said like crackle.

497
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:09,040
But I, out of like the 30 bars, ate 20 of them myself.

498
00:26:09,040 --> 00:26:09,920
Hell yeah.

499
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:11,840
And then I had to go to mom and dad and say like,

500
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:16,640
hey, I need to borrow $20 to cover my debt fucking high on my own supply gang.

501
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:21,600
And like, I think about that now and like,

502
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:28,400
I might as well have eaten 20 rocks as far as I'm concerned now as an adult.

503
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:30,400
Now at KitKat, I can fuck with.

504
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:33,760
KitKat, you can, the catchphrase, give me a break.

505
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:36,160
For me, that is prescriptive in a way.

506
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:38,800
It's pre-portioned.

507
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:39,120
Yes.

508
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:42,080
Sometimes I cut the Reese's in half.

509
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:43,760
I can't eat a whole Reese's cup.

510
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:46,400
What is this, Christmas?

511
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:48,160
Let's step out of the candy corner.

512
00:26:48,160 --> 00:26:48,880
Okay.

513
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:50,960
I'm starting to get comfy.

514
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:52,240
No, let's do a quick Yahoo.

515
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:52,480
Okay.

516
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:55,280
Because I don't think this will give us much room to play in the space.

517
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:56,800
I want you guys to play with me.

518
00:26:56,800 --> 00:26:58,080
I just don't think it's going to be possible.

519
00:26:58,080 --> 00:26:59,280
I just really want to explore this.

520
00:26:59,280 --> 00:27:00,480
It was sent in by Ian.

521
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:01,280
Thank you, Ian.

522
00:27:01,280 --> 00:27:05,600
It's an anonymous Yahoo Answers user who I'm going to call Poppy who asks,

523
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:12,160
is it possible to drink water without making any throat sounds at all?

524
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:13,760
Huh.

525
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:14,960
I don't want to name names.

526
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:26,480
I have edited at this point approximately 520 maybe plus hours of all of us.

527
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:27,680
Out of this episode?

528
00:27:28,160 --> 00:27:30,400
No, out of all of the podcasts we've ever done.

529
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:34,320
I just thought about that number and my butthole puckered up deep, deep.

530
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:35,760
It's deep down up inside of me.

531
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:41,440
Some of us, I don't want to name names, make pretty bad throat noises when they drink.

532
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:43,040
It makes me think that the throat is putting-

533
00:27:43,040 --> 00:27:43,680
Is it me?

534
00:27:43,680 --> 00:27:44,160
No.

535
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:44,720
Is it me?

536
00:27:45,920 --> 00:27:46,720
It's not Travis.

537
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:54,000
It makes me think your throat is doing extra work.

538
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:58,560
It makes me think your throat, when the water hits it, it gets panicked and every muscle

539
00:27:58,560 --> 00:28:02,320
in your throat is like, get this shit down to the tummy.

540
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:10,480
Maybe one of us is drinking chunkier water than the rest of us.

541
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:15,760
It's possible that West Virginia water is maybe it's got a lot of protein in it.

542
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:17,280
It's got a lot of minerals.

543
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:18,320
It's possible.

544
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:23,920
Part of it is if I work up the nerve to drink some water, I feel like I better make it really

545
00:28:23,920 --> 00:28:25,920
count because I'm already here.

546
00:28:25,920 --> 00:28:27,520
I better see how much I can get inside.

547
00:28:28,160 --> 00:28:28,720
Yeah, sure.

548
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:33,360
I actually like the noise, Justin.

549
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:38,320
It's to the point where it's like, I can't sleep without my wife snoring situation.

550
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:45,040
Is there anything we can do just to make the edit a little bit easier to make that water

551
00:28:45,040 --> 00:28:47,840
go down completely silently?

552
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:48,080
Okay.

553
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:52,480
Well, I have a bottle of water here and I'm going to turn up.

554
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:54,560
I'm going to put my microphone right in my throat.

555
00:28:54,560 --> 00:28:58,880
Yeah, just put your glottis right up against the microphone.

556
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:02,000
Just to see if you're full of shit.

557
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:02,640
Give me the base.

558
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:04,880
I'm just going to give you a base line.

559
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:05,600
A big swig too.

560
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:06,800
Don't take no baby sips.

561
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:17,760
This is the sort of heat that I have to touch with my special gloves every week, sometimes

562
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:18,480
twice a week.

563
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:24,240
Justin, how would you feel about if we installed within your throat some sort of sluice

564
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:32,880
situation where we could completely bypass any swallowing muscles and you would just

565
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:34,240
pour it down a wooden track?

566
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:36,800
I saw an episode of ER once.

567
00:29:36,800 --> 00:29:40,560
I think it was George Clooney did a tracheotomy with a ballpoint pen.

568
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:43,120
I think you might be thinking of scrubs.

569
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:43,440
Yeah.

570
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:44,240
Or the good doctor.

571
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:45,200
There's a lot of possibilities.

572
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:46,400
It's hard to say, but I-

573
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:47,600
It might be Grey's Anatomy.

574
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:50,960
I'm saying if you could do that with a pen, you could certainly do that with a Capri Sun

575
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:55,520
straw and just kind of hook you up to Capri Sun, right?

576
00:29:55,520 --> 00:30:00,880
I mean, we could get less gory with it and just hook you up with a proboscis.

577
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:02,080
And then it's up to you whenever you want to use it.

578
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:04,080
Well, but then you might have to deal with this kind of noise.

579
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:06,480
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

580
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:07,600
Dip in.

581
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:10,800
Do you hear noises when you're drinking a full drink with a straw?

582
00:30:10,800 --> 00:30:11,600
Not usually.

583
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:16,640
What about just like a beer bong, but the end of it connects to his belly button and

584
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:18,320
just goes straight inside his tummy?

585
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:21,040
This is obviously the best imaginable scenario, Travis.

586
00:30:21,040 --> 00:30:21,520
Yes.

587
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:28,240
I was about to suggest that I could try to do it silently, but I feel like if I succeeded,

588
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:32,800
that would be not great for me because then if the noise ever happened, it would feel

589
00:30:32,800 --> 00:30:35,120
very intentional and threatening.

590
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:41,520
Is it possible that you could just sleep not in your bed where you traditionally sleep,

591
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:47,840
but in like a kiddie pool full of like water with a little bit of glucose in it or something,

592
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:52,880
and you absorb through your skin like a froggy frog all the water that you need throughout

593
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:53,360
the day?

594
00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:56,960
And that's going to be actually juice pretty fucking efficient if you think about it.

595
00:30:56,960 --> 00:30:57,760
That would be nice.

596
00:30:57,760 --> 00:31:00,320
You know, it doesn't even just have to be at night.

597
00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:06,240
If we could build some kind of like pod where your head is out and you're able to speak

598
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:12,720
into the microphone, but inside of the pod is just your body osmosis-ing water all the

599
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:12,960
time.

600
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:13,360
Oh, shit.

601
00:31:13,360 --> 00:31:13,920
Flip it.

602
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:14,400
Flip it.

603
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:15,520
Flip that shit.

604
00:31:15,520 --> 00:31:17,760
Flip that shit around.

605
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:23,440
I'm imagining a sort of beanbag-sized apparatus or perhaps a like a punching bag that boxers

606
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:24,240
use to get strong.

607
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:25,200
What are they doing with that thing?

608
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:26,080
Getting stronger?

609
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:26,720
I don't think so.

610
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:28,160
Toughing up their knuckles.

611
00:31:28,160 --> 00:31:28,960
Yeah, I guess so.

612
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:31,600
One of those, it's about that size, but it's full of water.

613
00:31:32,160 --> 00:31:35,760
And we hang that up next to Justin's desk.

614
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:39,920
And then whenever you need to take a drink of water, Justin, your whole body can enter

615
00:31:39,920 --> 00:31:42,000
it and you just drink in there.

616
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,480
And I guarantee you, no sound's going to escape.

617
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:45,840
Ooh, I like that.

618
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:52,160
What if, beginning of the week, like a train, Justin moves under a big water tower, we open

619
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:56,720
it, it pours down his throat, and he has all of his water for the week in one go.

620
00:31:56,720 --> 00:31:57,440
That works too.

621
00:31:58,480 --> 00:32:00,320
So you get to pick now.

622
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:00,640
Yeah.

623
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:05,120
Boy, we spent a lot of time sort of criticizing the old train man.

624
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:07,840
Not really criticizing.

625
00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:08,880
It was fun.

626
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:11,840
I remember distinctly it being fun for a second.

627
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:13,520
Yeah.

628
00:32:13,520 --> 00:32:21,600
I think the easy fix juice is just put some water in your mouth and then sort of tilt

629
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:26,080
your head upward, but don't do anything with your muscles.

630
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:27,520
No muscular work at all.

631
00:32:27,520 --> 00:32:33,120
Yeah, just let the water fall down your neck.

632
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:34,240
Do you know what I'm saying?

633
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:35,440
And that's going to be better for you.

634
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:39,200
It's going to, like when you have a sore throat, like no ish at all because the water just

635
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:42,240
kind of falls down you.

636
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:43,200
Give that a spin now.

637
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:43,920
Okay.

638
00:32:45,040 --> 00:32:45,920
Give that a spin for me.

639
00:32:45,920 --> 00:32:46,880
No swallowing?

640
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:49,200
No muscular movement at all.

641
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:51,280
Yeah, you're going to swallow.

642
00:32:51,280 --> 00:32:53,520
Now juice, juice, juice, wait before you do it.

643
00:32:53,520 --> 00:32:56,480
The water's going to want to go down your lung holes.

644
00:32:56,480 --> 00:32:58,160
Okay, close those off.

645
00:32:58,160 --> 00:32:58,640
Close those off.

646
00:32:58,640 --> 00:33:00,240
Think about not doing that.

647
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:00,480
Yeah.

648
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:00,800
Okay.

649
00:33:00,800 --> 00:33:01,040
Yes.

650
00:33:01,040 --> 00:33:01,600
Okay, here we go.

651
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:02,100
Yeah.

652
00:33:08,800 --> 00:33:09,680
It got worse?

653
00:33:09,680 --> 00:33:10,720
Yeah, this is worse.

654
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:11,200
It's worse.

655
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:11,600
It's worse.

656
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:12,480
Let's go to the Money Zone.

657
00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:24,800
I don't want to talk.

658
00:33:24,800 --> 00:33:25,360
You guys talk.

659
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:27,120
Yeah, sure.

660
00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:29,520
I imagine you've done a number on your most of your-

661
00:33:29,520 --> 00:33:31,040
I need to get my human body back in order here.

662
00:33:31,040 --> 00:33:32,640
... your vital organs.

663
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:34,720
Hey, I want to tell you all about Squarespace.

664
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:36,080
Bad timing on this one.

665
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:36,960
Whoops-a-daisy.

666
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:40,400
Squarespace is fantastic.

667
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:43,840
Squarespace allows you to build a beautiful website you can use to showcase your work,

668
00:33:43,840 --> 00:33:48,320
announce an upcoming event or special project to promote your physical or online business,

669
00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:49,360
and more.

670
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:53,600
True, yes, we do have a new website elsewhere, but I still use Squarespace for my personal

671
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:53,920
website.

672
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:55,200
It was super easy to put together.

673
00:33:55,760 --> 00:33:59,120
Travis has set up Buttercup is a good, good-

674
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:01,040
Buttercup is a verygoodgirl.com.

675
00:34:01,040 --> 00:34:02,720
Yeah, that's a Squarespace joint.

676
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:06,480
If you want to make a website and you want to make it fucking now and you want it to

677
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:12,080
look awesome and you want it to have e-commerce functionality and analytics and built-in search

678
00:34:12,080 --> 00:34:18,160
engine optimization and award-winning customer support 24 hours a day, I mean, you got Squarespace.

679
00:34:18,160 --> 00:34:19,600
Squarespace is tops.

680
00:34:19,600 --> 00:34:20,320
And let me say this.

681
00:34:21,120 --> 00:34:23,520
We have got ourselves a second dog.

682
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:24,560
Her name is Lily.

683
00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:27,280
She is also a verygoodgirl.com.

684
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:32,560
And as soon as I get enough pictures of her, I will be building another Squarespace website

685
00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:34,400
called lilyisaveverygoodgirl.com.

686
00:34:34,400 --> 00:34:37,360
I should go buy that now before this episode goes up.

687
00:34:37,360 --> 00:34:37,680
Yes.

688
00:34:37,680 --> 00:34:39,600
And just go ahead and sit on that.

689
00:34:39,600 --> 00:34:43,680
I mean, the real competition, I think, is you need to do it before Justin does it because

690
00:34:43,680 --> 00:34:44,000
he-

691
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:44,640
Oh, no.

692
00:34:44,640 --> 00:34:47,520
Yeah, the juice, the race is on if you've recovered and are able to use it.

693
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:49,600
He's going to be way faster at it than me.

694
00:34:49,600 --> 00:34:52,640
So go to squarespace.com slash my brother for a free trial.

695
00:34:52,640 --> 00:34:56,560
And when you're ready to launch, use the offer code MYBROTHER, all one word, to save 10%

696
00:34:56,560 --> 00:34:58,640

697
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:01,040
Oh, sorry.

698
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:02,400
I'm racing Justin.

699
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:04,400
Yeah, I can't wait to see the results of this.

700
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:05,360
I'm just going to lose it.

701
00:35:05,360 --> 00:35:06,160
He needs this.

702
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:07,760
I need it?

703
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:09,280
I don't need your charity.

704
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:11,680
I don't need your charity.

705
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:15,040
Okay, then you read the next one while I get it.

706
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:15,920
All right.

707
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:17,040
Yeah, you grab it, Trav.

708
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:17,840
Go for it, bud.

709
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:19,760
Get it, Trav.

710
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:20,160
Get it.

711
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:20,800
I don't have it.

712
00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:22,000
Oh, no.

713
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:23,040
Did you already get it?

714
00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:24,480
You having any troubles getting it, bud?

715
00:35:25,120 --> 00:35:25,920
Did you already get it?

716
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:27,920
Oh, bud, I got it three weeks ago, bud.

717
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:31,360
No, I got it when you adopted the dog, bud.

718
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:32,880
Oh, no.

719
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:37,760
You shouldn't have texted me that you're getting a dog before you got to the URL of your dog.

720
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:39,040
Obviously.

721
00:35:41,120 --> 00:35:43,040
So Justin can now hook that up to whatever he wants.

722
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:45,200
I'm going to read the next ad because you guys are taking too long.

723
00:35:46,080 --> 00:35:46,800
It's Quip.

724
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:47,600
Quip is great.

725
00:35:47,600 --> 00:35:49,840
Everybody, I think all of us have a Quip toothbrush.

726
00:35:49,840 --> 00:35:50,720
I certainly do.

727
00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:54,160
And it's my sort of main bathroom bud.

728
00:35:54,160 --> 00:35:56,480
I use it and it fits in the mouth quite nice.

729
00:35:56,480 --> 00:35:59,040
And it gets all the nasty stuff off there.

730
00:36:00,080 --> 00:36:01,200
And it's fun.

731
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:02,320
I tell you my favorite thing about it.

732
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:04,800
We travel pretty much nonstop these days.

733
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:05,920
And it is so easy.

734
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:10,560
It's got this little case that you stick onto your mirror and you put your toothbrush in it.

735
00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:13,600
And then whenever you want to travel, it comes off the mirror and then the case

736
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:16,000
covers up the sensitive bristles.

737
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:17,280
And so you just take it right with you.

738
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:17,680
It's a great travel toothbrush.

739
00:36:17,680 --> 00:36:19,120
Also, it's an electric toothbrush.

740
00:36:19,120 --> 00:36:20,400
Yes, it's an electric toothbrush too.

741
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:21,680
I don't know if I said that, which is great.

742
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:24,400
I would not fuck with an analog toothbrush at this point.

743
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:29,040
Anyway, Quip is the gift that keeps refreshing with brush heads automatically delivered on

744
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:32,160
a dentist recommended schedule every three months for just $5.

745
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:39,440
I just got my first refill and I am never that diligent about re-upping my toothbrush game.

746
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:41,760
And it's so nice just getting those stiff bristles.

747
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:42,960
You know what my favorite thing about it is?

748
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:47,280
When you get the new one, you pop off the old one and it says in the instructions,

749
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:51,440
use the old one to clean it up to make it feel like a new toothbrush again.

750
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:51,920
It's genius.

751
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:56,400
I'm also on the plan where I get a AAA battery with it also.

752
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:57,440
Yeah, they don't recharge.

753
00:36:57,440 --> 00:36:59,120
Like you don't have to fucking worry about that.

754
00:36:59,120 --> 00:37:01,520
You just pop like one AAA into it, I think.

755
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:02,640
It's weird flags, but okay.

756
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:07,440
So lilyisaveverygoodgirl.com is taken.

757
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:11,680
Yeah, so Quip is, it looks like a big ticket tech gift with a stocking stuffer price starting

758
00:37:11,680 --> 00:37:12,320
at just $25.

759
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:17,360
Go to getquip.com slash my brother and get your first refill pack for free with a Quip

760
00:37:17,360 --> 00:37:18,400
electric toothbrush.

761
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:22,720
That's your first refill pack free at getquip.com slash my brother.

762
00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:29,040
So now I assume, Justin, I'm going to have to pay you or it may be a bidding war.

763
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:30,320
Off mic.

764
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:32,000
We'll figure it out.

765
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:37,040
Hey, if you like your podcast to be focused and well researched and your podcast host

766
00:37:37,040 --> 00:37:41,120
to be uncharismatic, unhorny strangers who have no interest in horses, then this is not

767
00:37:41,120 --> 00:37:42,240
the podcast for you.

768
00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:43,120
Yeah, and what's your deal?

769
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:45,200
I'm Emily.

770
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:45,920
I'm Lisa.

771
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:47,600
Our show is called Baby Geniuses.

772
00:37:47,600 --> 00:37:49,680
And its hosts are horny adult idiots.

773
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:52,640
We discover weird Wikipedia pages every episode.

774
00:37:52,640 --> 00:37:54,960
We discuss institutional misogyny.

775
00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:58,880
We ask each other the dumbest questions and our listeners won't stop sending us pictures

776
00:37:58,880 --> 00:37:59,600
of their butts.

777
00:37:59,600 --> 00:38:02,560
We haven't asked them to stop, but they also aren't stopping.

778
00:38:02,560 --> 00:38:04,560
Join us on Baby Geniuses.

779
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:06,640
Every other week on MaximumFun.org.

780
00:38:12,640 --> 00:38:13,680
I want a munch.

781
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:14,820
Squad.

782
00:38:14,820 --> 00:38:18,900
I want too much.

783
00:38:18,900 --> 00:38:19,400
Squad.

784
00:38:22,980 --> 00:38:26,340
This is a little bit different from Munch Squad because it's not about a menu innovation.

785
00:38:27,540 --> 00:38:31,860
And it's not even a lot of like bizarre PR speak.

786
00:38:32,580 --> 00:38:39,940
I just want to give it up to Burger King for going so hard.

787
00:38:41,140 --> 00:38:42,020
Two in a row.

788
00:38:42,020 --> 00:38:45,300
I'm going to give you the first one that's a little less amazing.

789
00:38:45,300 --> 00:38:47,380
Burger King introduces the dog purr.

790
00:38:49,380 --> 00:38:50,340
You need to say that again.

791
00:38:50,340 --> 00:38:53,300
I need you to really hit the consonants a little bit harder.

792
00:38:53,300 --> 00:38:55,460
Burger King introduces the dog purr.

793
00:38:56,660 --> 00:38:57,620
Dog purr.

794
00:38:57,620 --> 00:38:57,940
Dog purr.

795
00:38:57,940 --> 00:38:59,940
D-O-G-P-U-R.

796
00:38:59,940 --> 00:39:02,420
Instead of wa, there's dog.

797
00:39:04,740 --> 00:39:05,860
Oh Lord, take me now.

798
00:39:06,980 --> 00:39:08,420
Take me into your blessed kingdom.

799
00:39:08,420 --> 00:39:13,220
It's a special flame grilled bone for your dog.

800
00:39:13,940 --> 00:39:15,140
Oh, thank you.

801
00:39:15,140 --> 00:39:19,860
If you get it through Door Dash, then you're going to get a free one.

802
00:39:20,660 --> 00:39:22,020
Because they're going to bring it to your house.

803
00:39:22,020 --> 00:39:22,980
They're going to bring your food.

804
00:39:22,980 --> 00:39:26,100
Then got a little something for your four-legged friend.

805
00:39:26,100 --> 00:39:31,220
A little BK for a little Burger King for your king, Rex.

806
00:39:31,220 --> 00:39:33,780
Yeah, I don't have one of those.

807
00:39:33,780 --> 00:39:35,700
So what am I supposed to do with this?

808
00:39:35,700 --> 00:39:36,260
You eat it.

809
00:39:36,900 --> 00:39:38,100
No, stop.

810
00:39:38,100 --> 00:39:38,500
Stop.

811
00:39:38,500 --> 00:39:39,540
I want you guys to stop.

812
00:39:39,540 --> 00:39:41,460
And I want you to really use your fucking noggins.

813
00:39:41,460 --> 00:39:42,900
I want you to think about this.

814
00:39:42,900 --> 00:39:45,300
I would bet that a lot of people don't have dogs.

815
00:39:45,300 --> 00:39:46,820
I would say that if you're the type of person

816
00:39:46,820 --> 00:39:50,500
that has to order Burger King remotely,

817
00:39:50,500 --> 00:39:53,620
you're probably not in a place sort of in your life

818
00:39:53,620 --> 00:39:55,700
where you can support a dog.

819
00:39:55,700 --> 00:39:58,500
And so with that in mind, Burger King will deliver

820
00:39:58,500 --> 00:40:01,940
their hamburgers to you and a bone.

821
00:40:01,940 --> 00:40:03,620
This is fantastic news for me.

822
00:40:04,340 --> 00:40:04,820
Yes.

823
00:40:04,820 --> 00:40:05,700
It is good.

824
00:40:05,700 --> 00:40:09,540
I do question most fast food hamburgers are inedible

825
00:40:09,540 --> 00:40:11,300
before you leave the parking lot.

826
00:40:11,300 --> 00:40:13,540
You have about a 30 second freshness window

827
00:40:13,540 --> 00:40:15,700
to enjoy them and pretend you're eating food.

828
00:40:15,700 --> 00:40:17,300
But I cannot imagine it's like, well,

829
00:40:17,300 --> 00:40:18,900
it's been in my trunk for 20 minutes.

830
00:40:18,900 --> 00:40:19,860
So happy to be here.

831
00:40:19,860 --> 00:40:21,540
Please enjoy your food.

832
00:40:22,260 --> 00:40:23,620
Adjacent to a bone.

833
00:40:25,300 --> 00:40:28,180
They are not saying where these bones are coming from.

834
00:40:28,180 --> 00:40:28,740
Yes.

835
00:40:28,740 --> 00:40:30,180
Now, here's the thing, Griffin.

836
00:40:30,180 --> 00:40:32,820
If you don't have a dog for your dog purr,

837
00:40:32,820 --> 00:40:36,820
you can save them up and build an anatomically correct

838
00:40:36,820 --> 00:40:37,780
edible skeleton.

839
00:40:38,660 --> 00:40:39,380
Did you know that?

840
00:40:40,580 --> 00:40:41,300
For who?

841
00:40:41,300 --> 00:40:42,900
And I don't think they're delivering skulls.

842
00:40:42,900 --> 00:40:43,620
For the king.

843
00:40:43,620 --> 00:40:44,900
Yeah, they're not delivering.

844
00:40:44,900 --> 00:40:45,700
If you have two dogs now.

845
00:40:45,700 --> 00:40:49,140
No, you have to find this skull in a whimsical

846
00:40:49,140 --> 00:40:50,500
cross country adventure.

847
00:40:52,100 --> 00:40:53,780
I have a second.

848
00:40:53,780 --> 00:40:55,940
So like that, they came out with that, right?

849
00:40:56,660 --> 00:40:57,620
Legit.

850
00:40:57,620 --> 00:41:01,540
And then this just came out yesterday or any before.

851
00:41:01,540 --> 00:41:04,180
It's the Whopper Detour.

852
00:41:04,180 --> 00:41:06,340
And folks, I fucking love this.

853
00:41:06,340 --> 00:41:06,580
Okay.

854
00:41:07,780 --> 00:41:09,060
Do you already know about it, Griffin?

855
00:41:09,700 --> 00:41:13,620
No, it's just the name makes me think that you're on the

856
00:41:13,620 --> 00:41:16,660
Ural and you're taking a trip through the Mediterranean.

857
00:41:16,660 --> 00:41:17,540
So here it is.

858
00:41:18,180 --> 00:41:22,820
You can get, from now until December 12th,

859
00:41:22,820 --> 00:41:26,500
you can get a Burger King Whopper.

860
00:41:26,500 --> 00:41:29,220
If you order it through the Burger King app,

861
00:41:29,220 --> 00:41:32,020
you can get a Whopper for one cent.

862
00:41:33,780 --> 00:41:36,820
The trick of it is though, you're going to love this.

863
00:41:36,820 --> 00:41:40,100
The trick of it is, you got to order it at McDonald's.

864
00:41:41,380 --> 00:41:42,020
What?

865
00:41:42,020 --> 00:41:42,980
What?

866
00:41:42,980 --> 00:41:49,300
You have to go to McDonald's, activate the Burger King app.

867
00:41:49,300 --> 00:41:49,860
What?

868
00:41:49,860 --> 00:41:51,380
You have to go to McDonald's.

869
00:41:51,380 --> 00:41:53,940
You have to turn on your Burger King app.

870
00:41:53,940 --> 00:41:56,980
And if you're within 600 feet of a McDonald's,

871
00:41:56,980 --> 00:41:59,620
you can order a Whopper for a penny.

872
00:41:59,620 --> 00:42:02,500
It's so fucking good.

873
00:42:02,500 --> 00:42:06,020
I would please do go through the drive-through.

874
00:42:06,020 --> 00:42:07,620
You have to go through the drive-through.

875
00:42:07,620 --> 00:42:08,340
Like, what do you need?

876
00:42:08,340 --> 00:42:11,220
Like, just your GPS coordinates, I guess,

877
00:42:11,220 --> 00:42:13,140
because I'm getting a Whopper for a penny.

878
00:42:17,140 --> 00:42:18,660
This is very, this is-

879
00:42:18,660 --> 00:42:19,860
It's not even an ironic one.

880
00:42:19,860 --> 00:42:23,700
Did the Jackass crew become like the new marketing team

881
00:42:23,700 --> 00:42:24,740
for Burger King?

882
00:42:24,740 --> 00:42:29,300
Like, these seem like pranks to me.

883
00:42:29,300 --> 00:42:30,340
It is a prank.

884
00:42:31,140 --> 00:42:32,020
It's a prank.

885
00:42:32,820 --> 00:42:38,180
You can order it at almost all of the McDonald's 14,000 locations.

886
00:42:38,180 --> 00:42:38,980
You can get yourself-

887
00:42:41,140 --> 00:42:42,980
The poster for this is extremely good.

888
00:42:43,540 --> 00:42:45,780
It's the McDonald's sign kind of blurred out,

889
00:42:45,780 --> 00:42:48,260
and it just says, billion swerved,

890
00:42:48,260 --> 00:42:49,940
because they fucking got you.

891
00:42:49,940 --> 00:42:51,140
Oh, shit.

892
00:42:51,140 --> 00:42:53,060
They got you, McDonald's.

893
00:42:53,060 --> 00:42:53,860
Holy shit.

894
00:42:53,860 --> 00:42:55,620
That's really good, actually.

895
00:42:55,620 --> 00:42:59,940
Yeah, we're enjoying this in a very direct and unironic way,

896
00:42:59,940 --> 00:43:01,780
which I'm not super comfortable about.

897
00:43:03,540 --> 00:43:06,740
But I feel like McDonald's and Burger King

898
00:43:06,740 --> 00:43:09,940
have a sort of mutually assured destruction,

899
00:43:09,940 --> 00:43:14,100
sort of stalemate demilitarized zone between them right now.

900
00:43:14,100 --> 00:43:18,260
This is clearly an act of organized aggression

901
00:43:18,260 --> 00:43:22,420
that, like, I am terrified of what the repercussions of this,

902
00:43:22,420 --> 00:43:24,100
what McDonald's is going to do to answer.

903
00:43:26,100 --> 00:43:27,860
Oh, God, you're right, Griffin.

904
00:43:27,860 --> 00:43:28,900
This is going to escalate.

905
00:43:28,900 --> 00:43:29,940
It is going to escalate.

906
00:43:29,940 --> 00:43:30,580
That's true.

907
00:43:30,580 --> 00:43:33,140
This is the beginning of an arms race.

908
00:43:35,860 --> 00:43:37,540
If you burn down a Burger King,

909
00:43:37,540 --> 00:43:39,460
you get free McDonald's for life.

910
00:43:40,100 --> 00:43:41,860
No, don't say that, Griffin.

911
00:43:43,700 --> 00:43:44,420
I'm not done.

912
00:43:44,980 --> 00:43:45,780
I'm not done.

913
00:43:45,780 --> 00:43:47,860
The swerve's extremely good,

914
00:43:47,860 --> 00:43:50,340
but this year, and this one's already come and gone,

915
00:43:50,340 --> 00:43:54,020
this year, Burger King also opened whoppershopper.com.

916
00:43:55,620 --> 00:43:57,780
What's whoppershopper.com, you ask?

917
00:43:57,780 --> 00:43:59,540
Well, it launched for Black Friday

918
00:43:59,540 --> 00:44:00,820
and went till Cyber Monday.

919
00:44:00,820 --> 00:44:02,660
So it was real great.

920
00:44:02,660 --> 00:44:03,940
It's a quick deal.

921
00:44:03,940 --> 00:44:07,780
It was a site heavily populated by banner ads

922
00:44:07,780 --> 00:44:08,980
from different brands.

923
00:44:09,700 --> 00:44:12,580
And then you would put in the name of the brands

924
00:44:12,580 --> 00:44:14,100
that are being advertised there.

925
00:44:14,100 --> 00:44:17,780
And then because every time someone would click on the site,

926
00:44:18,340 --> 00:44:19,940
Burger King would earn money.

927
00:44:19,940 --> 00:44:22,660
And then they would give that money direct to free whoppers.

928
00:44:22,660 --> 00:44:25,860
So you would go to whopper-shopper.com

929
00:44:25,860 --> 00:44:30,020
and demand that brands buy you hamburgers

930
00:44:31,620 --> 00:44:34,020
in exchange for clicking on their banner ads.

931
00:44:35,620 --> 00:44:37,220
Thanks, Dick's Sporting Goods.

932
00:44:37,220 --> 00:44:38,100
Thanks, Dick's.

933
00:44:38,980 --> 00:44:40,820
Does the presence of a Munchquad in this episode

934
00:44:40,820 --> 00:44:43,300
mean we are not also getting That's a Christmas to me?

935
00:44:43,300 --> 00:44:43,860
It does.

936
00:44:43,860 --> 00:44:48,260
My wife and I have not had time to craft a new Hallmark film.

937
00:44:48,260 --> 00:44:49,140
I'm sorry.

938
00:44:49,140 --> 00:44:50,340
Let's answer another question.

939
00:44:50,340 --> 00:44:51,220
How's that sound to y'all?

940
00:44:51,940 --> 00:44:52,820
Yeah, is it?

941
00:44:52,820 --> 00:44:54,580
Yeah, regular question time.

942
00:44:54,580 --> 00:44:56,820
Recently, my close friend texted me

943
00:44:56,820 --> 00:44:58,980
asking if I still had Pokemon cards.

944
00:44:58,980 --> 00:44:59,700
Of course I do.

945
00:45:00,340 --> 00:45:04,180
Specifically, she wanted to know if I had a holographic Zapdos.

946
00:45:05,140 --> 00:45:06,500
Don't pretend like you don't know the word.

947
00:45:06,500 --> 00:45:07,460
I don't, bud.

948
00:45:07,460 --> 00:45:08,420
I don't.

949
00:45:08,420 --> 00:45:10,740
I never even finished one of those fucking things.

950
00:45:10,740 --> 00:45:13,140
And if so, if I was willing to part with it.

951
00:45:13,140 --> 00:45:15,860
I immediately and excitedly told her that I did.

952
00:45:15,860 --> 00:45:17,540
And of course she could have it for free.

953
00:45:17,540 --> 00:45:19,220
After a brief eBay search,

954
00:45:19,220 --> 00:45:21,380
I've realized that the version of the card I have

955
00:45:21,380 --> 00:45:22,980
is actually worth a good amount of money.

956
00:45:23,780 --> 00:45:24,580
What should I do?

957
00:45:25,140 --> 00:45:26,820
Do I still have to give it to her?

958
00:45:26,820 --> 00:45:28,260
Do I have to ask for some kind of payment?

959
00:45:28,820 --> 00:45:31,300
Or do I sell it on eBay for all it's worth?

960
00:45:31,300 --> 00:45:34,100
And this is from Pokemon Master in Medford.

961
00:45:34,100 --> 00:45:35,940
This is actually a good one.

962
00:45:35,940 --> 00:45:39,540
Let's, let's, can we, I hate to ask this

963
00:45:39,540 --> 00:45:40,740
this close to the holidays.

964
00:45:40,740 --> 00:45:43,300
Do you guys mind if we send jokes out of the room

965
00:45:43,300 --> 00:45:45,540
for a couple of minutes to really just hash through this?

966
00:45:45,540 --> 00:45:47,780
Oh yeah, jokes.

967
00:45:47,780 --> 00:45:48,820
Jokes, get out of here.

968
00:45:48,820 --> 00:45:49,620
Go have a sandwich.

969
00:45:49,620 --> 00:45:53,140
Go have a Burger King Whopper on us jokes.

970
00:45:55,140 --> 00:45:56,900
Let's take away, let's abstract this.

971
00:45:56,900 --> 00:45:57,400
Okay.

972
00:45:58,020 --> 00:46:00,180
I think about the, if my memory serves,

973
00:46:00,180 --> 00:46:02,500
I'm not as plugged into the market as I once was,

974
00:46:02,500 --> 00:46:05,460
but I think street value on a holographic Zapdos,

975
00:46:06,020 --> 00:46:10,740
if it's first edition, we're talking about 75 to $100.

976
00:46:10,740 --> 00:46:11,780
We sent jokes out of the room.

977
00:46:11,780 --> 00:46:13,140
I'm just gonna check the bay.

978
00:46:13,140 --> 00:46:14,020
I'll just check the bay.

979
00:46:14,020 --> 00:46:17,540
Yeah, see, see, see if I'm, see if I'm close.

980
00:46:18,420 --> 00:46:21,140
So if that's the case, if your friend says,

981
00:46:21,140 --> 00:46:23,620
hey, do you have 75 to $100?

982
00:46:23,620 --> 00:46:25,380
And you say, yes.

983
00:46:25,380 --> 00:46:27,220
And they say, are you willing to part with it?

984
00:46:27,220 --> 00:46:28,260
And you say, yes.

985
00:46:28,820 --> 00:46:31,060
You can't really walk that back, I feel like.

986
00:46:31,620 --> 00:46:36,020
There is a sort of wild variance on this.

987
00:46:37,940 --> 00:46:39,140
It looks like there is a, Griffin,

988
00:46:40,100 --> 00:46:42,340
just will you look Griffin, because you could probably like

989
00:46:42,340 --> 00:46:44,980
yeah, decode this a little better than I could.

990
00:46:44,980 --> 00:46:45,780
What did you search for?

991
00:46:45,780 --> 00:46:47,700
Holographic Zapdos.

992
00:46:48,420 --> 00:46:48,920
Okay.

993
00:46:49,700 --> 00:46:51,300
Yeah, I mean, we got some pre-owned ones

994
00:46:51,300 --> 00:46:53,060
that look a little dingy, a little beat up.

995
00:46:53,060 --> 00:46:54,500
They could also be fake.

996
00:46:54,500 --> 00:46:56,100
Some of them are from sun and moons.

997
00:46:56,100 --> 00:46:57,140
They're not first edition.

998
00:46:57,140 --> 00:46:58,980
Those are the ones you're looking at that are like $1.

999
00:46:59,860 --> 00:47:01,940
Then you start getting into the base set,

1000
00:47:01,940 --> 00:47:03,460
first gen holographic Zapdos.

1001
00:47:03,460 --> 00:47:04,740
You're talking about $65.

1002
00:47:04,740 --> 00:47:06,660
Here's a buy it now for 275.

1003
00:47:06,660 --> 00:47:07,460
Here's a 200.

1004
00:47:08,180 --> 00:47:08,660
Here's more.

1005
00:47:08,660 --> 00:47:13,300
Here's more what I was looking at about 85, 84, 95, 100.

1006
00:47:13,300 --> 00:47:14,980
That's about the, that's about where you're going.

1007
00:47:14,980 --> 00:47:15,620
So there's some core.

1008
00:47:15,620 --> 00:47:17,780
I mean, there's some serious coin on the line.

1009
00:47:17,780 --> 00:47:18,020
Yeah.

1010
00:47:18,020 --> 00:47:18,260
Okay.

1011
00:47:19,220 --> 00:47:20,180
And you know what?

1012
00:47:20,820 --> 00:47:22,260
Some serious Zapdos.

1013
00:47:22,260 --> 00:47:24,580
We can't just sort of look at the monetary value.

1014
00:47:24,580 --> 00:47:26,020
We've got to look at the strategic value.

1015
00:47:26,020 --> 00:47:26,820
This thing can play.

1016
00:47:26,820 --> 00:47:28,180
This thing can do thunder.

1017
00:47:28,180 --> 00:47:29,140
That's 60 damage.

1018
00:47:29,140 --> 00:47:30,900
It can also use Thunderbolt for 100 damage.

1019
00:47:30,900 --> 00:47:33,540
Like this is a fucking powerful car.

1020
00:47:33,540 --> 00:47:34,500
It's a powerhouse.

1021
00:47:35,140 --> 00:47:35,700
Yeah.

1022
00:47:35,700 --> 00:47:38,180
I guess the thing that I'm left wondering

1023
00:47:38,180 --> 00:47:40,260
and Griffin maybe you can give some insight to this.

1024
00:47:41,220 --> 00:47:46,500
Why would your friend call and ask you for Zapdos

1025
00:47:46,500 --> 00:47:49,540
if not because either A, it is a powerful card

1026
00:47:49,540 --> 00:47:51,540
that they wish to use in playing the game.

1027
00:47:51,540 --> 00:47:51,860
Yeah.

1028
00:47:51,860 --> 00:47:54,340
Or B, they know it is worth money.

1029
00:47:55,220 --> 00:47:57,220
Those are the only two reasons.

1030
00:47:57,220 --> 00:47:59,700
The only third is some kind of art project

1031
00:47:59,700 --> 00:48:05,460
that specifically means that Zapdos-esque flair to it.

1032
00:48:05,460 --> 00:48:07,860
Well, and boy, jokes has been out of the room

1033
00:48:07,860 --> 00:48:08,660
for such a long time.

1034
00:48:08,660 --> 00:48:10,020
I'm starting to miss them.

1035
00:48:10,020 --> 00:48:12,340
But like it could also be a collection thing,

1036
00:48:12,340 --> 00:48:14,420
like where they just need a holographic Zapdos.

1037
00:48:14,420 --> 00:48:16,820
I mean, it's also kind of a cool looking card, isn't it?

1038
00:48:16,820 --> 00:48:18,900
Look at this big bird, this big scary bird

1039
00:48:18,900 --> 00:48:21,620
with a holographic background behind it.

1040
00:48:21,620 --> 00:48:23,540
It's a powerful object.

1041
00:48:23,540 --> 00:48:25,220
Like sometimes you just want,

1042
00:48:25,220 --> 00:48:27,140
you know how people are like really into crystals

1043
00:48:27,140 --> 00:48:29,060
because of the power that resides inside of them?

1044
00:48:29,060 --> 00:48:30,100
That's kind of what's going on

1045
00:48:30,100 --> 00:48:31,620
with this holographic Zapdos card.

1046
00:48:32,660 --> 00:48:32,980
Okay.

1047
00:48:32,980 --> 00:48:37,220
Okay, what do you owe this person?

1048
00:48:38,020 --> 00:48:41,860
Assuming it's monetary, what do you owe this person?

1049
00:48:41,860 --> 00:48:43,060
Because it seems weird.

1050
00:48:43,700 --> 00:48:47,300
We have to, there's no fucking way it's monetary.

1051
00:48:47,300 --> 00:48:48,820
For them to email you and say,

1052
00:48:48,820 --> 00:48:49,700
do you have Pokemon cards?

1053
00:48:49,700 --> 00:48:51,140
Do you have a holographic Zapdos?

1054
00:48:51,140 --> 00:48:51,860
I need that.

1055
00:48:51,860 --> 00:48:54,740
That's a wild way to get 85 bucks off your friend, huh?

1056
00:48:54,740 --> 00:48:58,420
It is wild, but they did say holographic, didn't they?

1057
00:48:59,380 --> 00:49:00,340
That's not for play.

1058
00:49:00,340 --> 00:49:00,980
You could play.

1059
00:49:00,980 --> 00:49:02,660
You could play a non-holographic Zapdos.

1060
00:49:02,660 --> 00:49:03,620
Damn it, Justin, you're right.

1061
00:49:03,620 --> 00:49:06,500
This also means, Griffin, if it's for a collection,

1062
00:49:06,500 --> 00:49:08,340
they've looked it up and said,

1063
00:49:08,340 --> 00:49:10,020
mm, $85, no thank you.

1064
00:49:10,020 --> 00:49:11,220
I'll just see if they have one.

1065
00:49:11,220 --> 00:49:13,460
Just con my idiot friend Jeremy.

1066
00:49:13,460 --> 00:49:13,960
Yes.

1067
00:49:14,980 --> 00:49:16,980
They know exactly what they're doing, Griffin.

1068
00:49:17,540 --> 00:49:19,780
They're trying to catch them all.

1069
00:49:19,780 --> 00:49:21,620
And by um, I mean you.

1070
00:49:21,620 --> 00:49:23,620
And by all, I mean in a trap.

1071
00:49:23,620 --> 00:49:27,220
I'm also pretty sure that Zapdos isn't allowed

1072
00:49:27,220 --> 00:49:28,340
in like league play.

1073
00:49:28,340 --> 00:49:29,220
It's legendary.

1074
00:49:29,220 --> 00:49:31,380
Okay, let's bring jokes back in the room.

1075
00:49:31,380 --> 00:49:32,900
Hey, jokes, thanks for coming.

1076
00:49:32,900 --> 00:49:33,860
I'm afraid of Griffin.

1077
00:49:33,860 --> 00:49:34,740
Fart, fart, fart.

1078
00:49:36,660 --> 00:49:38,580
What would smell like if Zapdos farted?

1079
00:49:40,100 --> 00:49:41,460
A one man play.

1080
00:49:41,460 --> 00:49:44,180
Sorry, Griffin, coming to Broadway.

1081
00:49:44,180 --> 00:49:46,660
Yeah, what if you had sex with Zapdos and it was pregnant?

1082
00:49:46,660 --> 00:49:48,980
Do you guys feel better now that the jokes are back?

1083
00:49:48,980 --> 00:49:49,940
A little bit, actually.

1084
00:49:49,940 --> 00:49:51,300
That is actually very good.

1085
00:49:51,300 --> 00:49:53,460
I think you have to ask them.

1086
00:49:54,180 --> 00:49:55,620
Nope, sorry.

1087
00:49:55,620 --> 00:49:57,540
You agreed to it.

1088
00:49:57,540 --> 00:50:00,580
You were so excited about someone being interested

1089
00:50:00,580 --> 00:50:02,580
in the collection that you just agreed to it.

1090
00:50:02,580 --> 00:50:03,860
I think you gotta live with that.

1091
00:50:04,500 --> 00:50:06,100
Yeah, yeah.

1092
00:50:07,300 --> 00:50:09,380
Damn it, I wish I still had my fucking Pokemon cards.

1093
00:50:09,380 --> 00:50:11,540
Damn it, I wish I was playing any kind of TCG right now.

1094
00:50:11,540 --> 00:50:12,820
Boys, you gotta stop me.

1095
00:50:12,820 --> 00:50:14,980
I'm an adult with more money than I had when I was a teen.

1096
00:50:14,980 --> 00:50:17,300
I could buy a bunch of TCG shit right now.

1097
00:50:17,300 --> 00:50:19,220
What happened to all your Pokemon cards, Griffin?

1098
00:50:19,220 --> 00:50:20,420
I did sell them.

1099
00:50:21,060 --> 00:50:22,100
I did all right.

1100
00:50:22,100 --> 00:50:23,620
Made a little scratch.

1101
00:50:23,620 --> 00:50:24,980
Do you think you would have made more money now

1102
00:50:24,980 --> 00:50:25,860
if you had just waited?

1103
00:50:25,860 --> 00:50:27,460
Uh, yeah, pal.

1104
00:50:28,340 --> 00:50:29,700
Does that bother you?

1105
00:50:29,700 --> 00:50:31,780
Let's spend, actually, let's spend the rest of this podcast

1106
00:50:31,780 --> 00:50:33,620
just me looking up cards that I definitely did.

1107
00:50:33,620 --> 00:50:35,940
Oh, holographic Blastoise, that's 175 bucks.

1108
00:50:35,940 --> 00:50:38,420
That's about what I made for my entire collection.

1109
00:50:38,420 --> 00:50:40,020
So that one hurts.

1110
00:50:40,020 --> 00:50:42,580
What about the promotional Mewtwo

1111
00:50:42,580 --> 00:50:44,900
from the movie that got released?

1112
00:50:44,900 --> 00:50:47,780
Here it is for $249.

1113
00:50:47,780 --> 00:50:50,180
So that one really shrinks the old nuts.

1114
00:50:53,940 --> 00:50:55,540
All right, I can't fucking do this anymore.

1115
00:50:55,540 --> 00:50:56,820
Griffin, you need the distraction.

1116
00:50:56,820 --> 00:50:57,460
Yeah, sure.

1117
00:50:59,300 --> 00:51:00,420
This one was sent in by Nick G.

1118
00:51:00,420 --> 00:51:00,980
Thank you, Nick.

1119
00:51:00,980 --> 00:51:01,620
It's a Yahoo!

1120
00:51:01,620 --> 00:51:03,060
Answers user anonymous.

1121
00:51:03,060 --> 00:51:04,820
What's weird is that it's an actual user

1122
00:51:04,820 --> 00:51:07,700
who has made their name literally anonymous,

1123
00:51:07,700 --> 00:51:09,940
which is a strange way of going about it.

1124
00:51:10,740 --> 00:51:15,300
And it's, is this Radio Disney song about sex?

1125
00:51:16,660 --> 00:51:18,340
Heard this song on Radio Disney the other day

1126
00:51:18,340 --> 00:51:20,260
while my little sister was listening to it in the car.

1127
00:51:20,260 --> 00:51:21,300
Started listening to the lyrics

1128
00:51:21,300 --> 00:51:24,100
and there seems to be a ton of sexual references in them.

1129
00:51:24,100 --> 00:51:26,340
Show me yours and I'll show you mine.

1130
00:51:26,340 --> 00:51:28,260
You be the lock and I'll be the key.

1131
00:51:28,260 --> 00:51:31,140
W-T-H, what do you, W-T-H?

1132
00:51:31,140 --> 00:51:32,100
What the hell?

1133
00:51:32,100 --> 00:51:34,580
Why is this on, why is this on Radio Disney?

1134
00:51:34,580 --> 00:51:35,220
What do you think?

1135
00:51:35,220 --> 00:51:36,900
Am I interpreting the lyrics wrong?

1136
00:51:36,900 --> 00:51:39,780
The song is Midnight Romeo

1137
00:51:39,780 --> 00:51:43,220
by a band or artist named Push Play.

1138
00:51:43,220 --> 00:51:46,020
This was on Radio Disney where Goofy lives?

1139
00:51:47,780 --> 00:51:48,580
Where Goofy lives?

1140
00:51:48,580 --> 00:51:50,020
Goofy is trapped inside Radio Disney.

1141
00:51:50,820 --> 00:51:52,420
So some of the lyrics include,

1142
00:51:52,420 --> 00:51:54,180
my lips touch your lips.

1143
00:51:54,180 --> 00:51:56,500
My hands is on your hips.

1144
00:51:56,500 --> 00:51:58,980
What's it gonna take for you to give me my goodnight kiss?

1145
00:51:59,700 --> 00:52:01,140
Man, they went for that, huh?

1146
00:52:01,140 --> 00:52:02,100
Instead of the lyric,

1147
00:52:02,100 --> 00:52:04,900
you'll be screaming for more and more and more of me.

1148
00:52:05,620 --> 00:52:06,980
Yeah, so that's in there too.

1149
00:52:06,980 --> 00:52:07,460
They turned it off in the house.

1150
00:52:07,460 --> 00:52:10,660
Where Goofy lives with his friend Donald?

1151
00:52:10,660 --> 00:52:11,940
In my home?

1152
00:52:11,940 --> 00:52:16,020
We're singing this next to Mickey Mouse who's 90 years old.

1153
00:52:16,020 --> 00:52:17,780
His fucking heart can't take Midnight Romeo.

1154
00:52:17,780 --> 00:52:19,380
Gonna make you sweat.

1155
00:52:19,380 --> 00:52:22,500
Gonna feel it head to toe.

1156
00:52:22,500 --> 00:52:24,340
The orgasm.

1157
00:52:24,340 --> 00:52:26,180
Right after that line though, it says,

1158
00:52:26,180 --> 00:52:28,660
I'll be your Dr. Jekyll, your Mr. Hyde.

1159
00:52:28,660 --> 00:52:30,340
Which makes me think that Push Play

1160
00:52:30,340 --> 00:52:32,820
might have a fundamental misunderstanding

1161
00:52:32,820 --> 00:52:34,980
of the story of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde.

1162
00:52:34,980 --> 00:52:36,340
Horror of six.

1163
00:52:41,060 --> 00:52:42,260
This is a good song.

1164
00:52:44,740 --> 00:52:45,860
There's also a line here,

1165
00:52:45,860 --> 00:52:47,540
tonight's about to win.

1166
00:52:48,180 --> 00:52:48,740
What's that mean?

1167
00:52:48,740 --> 00:52:49,540
What's that mean?

1168
00:52:49,540 --> 00:52:51,380
Hey, are you sure you got that right?

1169
00:52:51,380 --> 00:52:53,380
You guys don't say that right before you make coitus?

1170
00:52:54,420 --> 00:52:55,780
Tonight's gonna win.

1171
00:52:55,780 --> 00:52:58,580
Tonight's gonna be so, it's gonna be epic.

1172
00:52:58,580 --> 00:53:00,900
I say that as I'm stretching, preparing my body.

1173
00:53:00,900 --> 00:53:02,740
It's gonna be, it's about to be epic.

1174
00:53:03,380 --> 00:53:04,260
I'm just saying,

1175
00:53:04,820 --> 00:53:06,260
Uncle Scrooge is gonna have to have a talk

1176
00:53:06,260 --> 00:53:07,300
with Huey, Dewey and Louie

1177
00:53:07,300 --> 00:53:08,740
who live inside of Radio Disney

1178
00:53:08,740 --> 00:53:10,420
because this song is their new neighbor.

1179
00:53:11,060 --> 00:53:13,700
And it's talking about, you know, sweat.

1180
00:53:13,700 --> 00:53:18,420
I do believe, even if there were no other references,

1181
00:53:18,420 --> 00:53:21,620
something about the word sweat in a song of like,

1182
00:53:21,620 --> 00:53:23,780
I don't know how to explain this to my kids.

1183
00:53:23,780 --> 00:53:26,340
It's never been used in a non-erotic sense

1184
00:53:26,340 --> 00:53:27,460
when speaking about music.

1185
00:53:27,460 --> 00:53:29,380
If you're even gonna make you sweat,

1186
00:53:29,380 --> 00:53:30,820
that could be referring to dancing

1187
00:53:30,820 --> 00:53:32,100
or perhaps working out.

1188
00:53:32,100 --> 00:53:34,260
It could also be, you know,

1189
00:53:34,260 --> 00:53:36,260
a reference to working out that boner.

1190
00:53:37,060 --> 00:53:38,340
Maybe we go through line by line

1191
00:53:38,340 --> 00:53:40,020
and see if we can make it sort of,

1192
00:53:40,820 --> 00:53:42,900
we can interpret it in a Disney way.

1193
00:53:42,900 --> 00:53:44,020
In a Disney way.

1194
00:53:44,020 --> 00:53:44,520
Okay.

1195
00:53:45,620 --> 00:53:47,460
So, meet me at my door.

1196
00:53:48,020 --> 00:53:49,300
I'm also looking at the lyrics.

1197
00:53:49,860 --> 00:53:51,780
By the end, meet me by my door

1198
00:53:51,780 --> 00:53:52,900
at the, by the end of the night.

1199
00:53:52,900 --> 00:53:53,380
That's okay.

1200
00:53:53,380 --> 00:53:55,940
That could be something you say to a UPS driver.

1201
00:53:55,940 --> 00:53:56,900
I have a pizza for you.

1202
00:53:57,540 --> 00:54:00,180
You'll be screaming for more and more and more of.

1203
00:54:00,180 --> 00:54:02,260
Already we've hit a considerable roadblock.

1204
00:54:02,260 --> 00:54:03,860
This is a pretty big bump.

1205
00:54:03,860 --> 00:54:04,660
That's challenging.

1206
00:54:06,980 --> 00:54:08,180
I also want to say though,

1207
00:54:08,180 --> 00:54:08,900
the next line is,

1208
00:54:08,900 --> 00:54:11,380
tonight's a big night, so let's make history.

1209
00:54:11,380 --> 00:54:11,620
Okay.

1210
00:54:11,620 --> 00:54:14,580
Which must imply that the sex is going to be so good.

1211
00:54:14,580 --> 00:54:17,380
People will write about it for years to come.

1212
00:54:17,380 --> 00:54:18,500
The year of our Lord.

1213
00:54:20,020 --> 00:54:22,500
So, what if they finally figured out sex?

1214
00:54:22,500 --> 00:54:24,500
Let's take this first stanza

1215
00:54:24,500 --> 00:54:26,820
and we'll say that it is actually

1216
00:54:26,820 --> 00:54:28,420
about a pizza being delivered

1217
00:54:28,420 --> 00:54:29,540
and it is sung from the,

1218
00:54:30,500 --> 00:54:32,420
from the perspective of the pizza.

1219
00:54:32,420 --> 00:54:33,140
Okay.

1220
00:54:33,140 --> 00:54:35,460
You'll be screaming for more and more and more of me.

1221
00:54:35,460 --> 00:54:36,820
More pizza, please.

1222
00:54:36,820 --> 00:54:39,220
That goes with my lips touch your lips.

1223
00:54:39,220 --> 00:54:41,220
It'll be like, oh, your lips touch my pizza lips.

1224
00:54:41,220 --> 00:54:42,740
I guess I'm not falsifying.

1225
00:54:42,740 --> 00:54:44,260
That's what pepperonis is.

1226
00:54:44,260 --> 00:54:45,460
Pepperonis is pizza lips.

1227
00:54:45,460 --> 00:54:47,620
Now, my hand is on your hips.

1228
00:54:47,620 --> 00:54:48,900
Now that could just be,

1229
00:54:48,900 --> 00:54:50,980
my pizza hands are kind of on your,

1230
00:54:50,980 --> 00:54:52,020
like a moment on the lips,

1231
00:54:52,020 --> 00:54:53,300
a lifetime on the hips.

1232
00:54:53,300 --> 00:54:54,420
Oh, yes, yes, yes.

1233
00:54:54,420 --> 00:54:56,820
You're putting on the LBs from eating so much za.

1234
00:54:57,700 --> 00:54:59,860
What's it gonna take for you to give me my goodnight kiss?

1235
00:54:59,860 --> 00:55:01,300
Like, late night snack.

1236
00:55:01,300 --> 00:55:02,020
I thought you were done.

1237
00:55:02,020 --> 00:55:03,940
It came back for more za, perfect.

1238
00:55:04,580 --> 00:55:05,460
Oh, whoa.

1239
00:55:05,460 --> 00:55:06,580
Have you guys ever left?

1240
00:55:06,580 --> 00:55:08,100
I've done this so many times recently.

1241
00:55:08,100 --> 00:55:09,140
I hate to admit it.

1242
00:55:09,140 --> 00:55:12,180
Have you guys ever left a pizza out all night

1243
00:55:12,180 --> 00:55:12,980
in self-defense?

1244
00:55:13,700 --> 00:55:15,060
I've gotten in the habit of like,

1245
00:55:15,940 --> 00:55:16,900
I gotta let it rot.

1246
00:55:16,900 --> 00:55:17,860
I can't put it away.

1247
00:55:17,860 --> 00:55:19,620
You gotta let it, you gotta.

1248
00:55:19,620 --> 00:55:21,700
Now, this fits our pizza theme.

1249
00:55:21,700 --> 00:55:22,260
It's so good.

1250
00:55:22,260 --> 00:55:23,780
The next line is, oh, whoa.

1251
00:55:23,780 --> 00:55:26,260
My heart is being fast, but my hands are moving slow.

1252
00:55:26,260 --> 00:55:28,020
I think this person's having a heart attack.

1253
00:55:29,220 --> 00:55:30,820
They ate too much pizza.

1254
00:55:30,820 --> 00:55:31,620
Yeah, sure.

1255
00:55:31,620 --> 00:55:33,060
Now their heart is being fast

1256
00:55:33,060 --> 00:55:34,420
and like their hand,

1257
00:55:34,420 --> 00:55:36,580
you know, they're having pain in their arm.

1258
00:55:36,580 --> 00:55:38,420
Okay, so this one's tough.

1259
00:55:38,420 --> 00:55:40,340
Late night, gonna hit the town,

1260
00:55:40,340 --> 00:55:41,780
gonna take you out, gonna make you go, whoa, whoa.

1261
00:55:41,780 --> 00:55:44,900
You would not do this with, wouldn't do that with pizza.

1262
00:55:44,900 --> 00:55:48,820
I can't, you could take your pizza out on the town,

1263
00:55:48,820 --> 00:55:50,020
like, hey pizza, I'm gonna show you

1264
00:55:50,020 --> 00:55:51,780
some of my favorite hotspots.

1265
00:55:51,780 --> 00:55:53,220
I don't think pizza can be like,

1266
00:55:53,220 --> 00:55:55,940
this one's on me, let's go, I'm driving.

1267
00:55:55,940 --> 00:55:59,140
Is this a switch in perspective to the driver maybe?

1268
00:55:59,860 --> 00:56:02,340
If that's the case, then it's gonna make you sweat.

1269
00:56:02,340 --> 00:56:03,140
Here's the problem, boys.

1270
00:56:03,140 --> 00:56:04,340
I'm looking three lines ahead.

1271
00:56:04,340 --> 00:56:05,620
We got gonna make you sweat

1272
00:56:05,620 --> 00:56:06,260
and it's gonna be tough though.

1273
00:56:06,260 --> 00:56:07,780
We've got that and show me yours

1274
00:56:07,780 --> 00:56:08,740
and I'll show you mine.

1275
00:56:08,740 --> 00:56:09,700
And that's just hard.

1276
00:56:09,700 --> 00:56:10,500
That's just tough.

1277
00:56:10,500 --> 00:56:11,940
And I'll tell you, there's no reason.

1278
00:56:11,940 --> 00:56:13,700
I've eaten so much pizza in my life.

1279
00:56:13,700 --> 00:56:16,020
The next line is literally the title of the song,

1280
00:56:16,020 --> 00:56:16,980
Midnight Romeo.

1281
00:56:16,980 --> 00:56:18,420
I've never said anything even like close to that.

1282
00:56:18,420 --> 00:56:19,620
That's the name of the pizza company.

1283
00:56:19,620 --> 00:56:21,540
The pizza company is Midnight Romeo.

1284
00:56:21,540 --> 00:56:23,940
Romeo's Pizza delivers very late

1285
00:56:23,940 --> 00:56:24,900
and they want you to know

1286
00:56:24,900 --> 00:56:26,660
you can get Romeos at midnight

1287
00:56:26,660 --> 00:56:28,980
or a Midnight Romeo as they have called it here.

1288
00:56:28,980 --> 00:56:29,780
If you will.

1289
00:56:29,780 --> 00:56:31,060
Show me yours, I'll show you mine.

1290
00:56:31,060 --> 00:56:31,940
That's easy.

1291
00:56:31,940 --> 00:56:34,340
They've got a pizza exchange program where-

1292
00:56:35,220 --> 00:56:37,460
Give me your old pizza, I'll give you this new one.

1293
00:56:37,460 --> 00:56:37,960
Exactly.

1294
00:56:38,660 --> 00:56:40,740
Alternatively, you know how every PG-13 movie

1295
00:56:40,740 --> 00:56:42,100
you can say fucking at once?

1296
00:56:42,100 --> 00:56:44,580
Maybe this one line is referring to genitals.

1297
00:56:44,580 --> 00:56:46,820
Now we do get to Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde.

1298
00:56:46,820 --> 00:56:47,220
Do they work?

1299
00:56:47,220 --> 00:56:49,540
I wanna hear it gonna make you sweat,

1300
00:56:49,540 --> 00:56:50,580
gonna feel it from head to toe.

1301
00:56:51,540 --> 00:56:54,260
That's jalapeno on the pizza.

1302
00:56:54,260 --> 00:56:55,460
It's very spicy and you're like,

1303
00:56:55,460 --> 00:56:57,460
ooh, I can feel this through my whole body.

1304
00:56:57,460 --> 00:56:58,260
It's so zesty.

1305
00:56:58,980 --> 00:57:01,060
Oh, and it says here a little later in the song,

1306
00:57:01,060 --> 00:57:02,420
tonight your dinner's free.

1307
00:57:03,060 --> 00:57:05,700
So like, they probably got there after 30 minutes.

1308
00:57:05,700 --> 00:57:08,900
Let me just say problematic Push Play lyrics.

1309
00:57:08,900 --> 00:57:10,180
Tonight your dinner's free.

1310
00:57:10,180 --> 00:57:11,140
What's in it for me?

1311
00:57:11,860 --> 00:57:13,620
No, sometimes you just buy the pizza

1312
00:57:13,620 --> 00:57:15,220
because you wanna buy the pizza for someone.

1313
00:57:15,220 --> 00:57:16,340
Yeah, hey, Goofy's in there.

1314
00:57:16,340 --> 00:57:18,100
So watch what you're doing there, Push Play.

1315
00:57:18,740 --> 00:57:23,300
I played my little one, my four-year-old.

1316
00:57:23,860 --> 00:57:26,980
We were talking to her about Kesha and who Kesha is.

1317
00:57:26,980 --> 00:57:30,900
I think she came up because your wife Teresa

1318
00:57:30,900 --> 00:57:33,220
had discussed Kesha with her on tour.

1319
00:57:33,220 --> 00:57:36,900
And I wanted to play a song of hers to familiarize her

1320
00:57:36,900 --> 00:57:38,100
with this concept.

1321
00:57:38,100 --> 00:57:40,820
So I picked TikTok, the concept of Kesha,

1322
00:57:40,820 --> 00:57:42,340
the very idea of Kesha.

1323
00:57:42,340 --> 00:57:45,300
And I picked TikTok because it slaps.

1324
00:57:45,300 --> 00:57:48,740
But I noticed that luckily there's a Kidz Bop version of it

1325
00:57:49,540 --> 00:57:52,180
because some of the lyrics are challenging

1326
00:57:52,180 --> 00:57:52,980
for a four-year-old.

1327
00:57:53,780 --> 00:57:56,100
I just wanna hit you guys with it.

1328
00:57:56,100 --> 00:57:57,940
Yeah, what does she brush her teeth with?

1329
00:57:57,940 --> 00:58:00,660
Okay, so grab my glasses.

1330
00:58:00,660 --> 00:58:01,380
I'm out the door.

1331
00:58:01,380 --> 00:58:02,580
I'm gonna hit this city.

1332
00:58:02,580 --> 00:58:05,460
Before I leave, brush my teeth, and then I go and pack.

1333
00:58:07,060 --> 00:58:09,380
Because when I leave for the night, I ain't coming back.

1334
00:58:09,380 --> 00:58:11,620
Well, that's very responsible.

1335
00:58:11,620 --> 00:58:13,860
You're gonna go maybe spend the night at a friend's house.

1336
00:58:13,860 --> 00:58:14,740
Spend the night at a friend's house.

1337
00:58:14,740 --> 00:58:18,900
And then later we got drop topping, playing our favorite CDs,

1338
00:58:18,900 --> 00:58:23,540
pulling up to the parties, trying to get a little bit silly,

1339
00:58:23,540 --> 00:58:26,500
which actually sounds more like drug use than tipsy.

1340
00:58:28,340 --> 00:58:30,820
Tipsy sounds like I'm gonna have one drink too many

1341
00:58:30,820 --> 00:58:33,540
because I've earned it, I've had a hard day at work.

1342
00:58:33,540 --> 00:58:35,060
I'm going to have one drink too many

1343
00:58:35,060 --> 00:58:37,220
and then wait and sober up before I head home.

1344
00:58:37,220 --> 00:58:42,500
So here's a weird change I didn't see coming.

1345
00:58:42,500 --> 00:58:44,180
Don't stop, make it pop.

1346
00:58:44,180 --> 00:58:46,100
DJ, blow my speakers up.

1347
00:58:46,100 --> 00:58:49,620
Tonight, I'm all right till we see the sunlight.

1348
00:58:49,620 --> 00:58:52,100
So that's, again, perhaps-

1349
00:58:52,100 --> 00:58:53,300
Not I'm gonna fight?

1350
00:58:53,300 --> 00:58:54,900
No, they're all right.

1351
00:58:54,900 --> 00:58:57,540
Like, this is more disturbing, Kidz Bop.

1352
00:58:57,540 --> 00:59:00,900
This is someone who is only okay when it's nighttime

1353
00:59:00,900 --> 00:59:02,660
and they're in a darkened club.

1354
00:59:02,660 --> 00:59:05,540
And then when they see the sun come up at five in the morning,

1355
00:59:05,540 --> 00:59:08,260
they're like, well, time to get back to my terrible kids,

1356
00:59:08,260 --> 00:59:09,620
I guess, I hate this.

1357
00:59:10,180 --> 00:59:14,180
And then the best part of TikTok, the Kidz Bop version,

1358
00:59:14,180 --> 00:59:18,500
is that's all the words in the entire song

1359
00:59:18,500 --> 00:59:20,900
because they can't make any of the rest.

1360
00:59:20,900 --> 00:59:22,820
The rest of the song is unsalvageable.

1361
00:59:22,820 --> 00:59:25,540
So I hand to God for 90 seconds,

1362
00:59:25,540 --> 00:59:29,540
they do the chorus five times and that's it.

1363
00:59:29,540 --> 00:59:31,780
That's it, they can't do anything.

1364
00:59:31,780 --> 00:59:33,060
They can't like get like,

1365
00:59:33,060 --> 00:59:35,140
boys wanna touch our junk and all that stuff.

1366
00:59:35,140 --> 00:59:36,740
Nope, can't figure it out.

1367
00:59:36,740 --> 00:59:38,420
Can't figure it out, can't do it.

1368
00:59:38,420 --> 00:59:40,820
Just gonna do the chorus five times, Kidz Bop.

1369
00:59:40,820 --> 00:59:43,300
The Kidz Bop version of Sleazy is just an instrumental.

1370
00:59:44,180 --> 00:59:47,140
Thank you all so much for listening to our program.

1371
00:59:47,140 --> 00:59:48,180
We hope you've enjoyed yourself.

1372
00:59:48,900 --> 00:59:52,500
Again, our new website and YouTube channel is McElroy Family.

1373
00:59:52,500 --> 00:59:55,780
If you are subscribed to MBMBAM on YouTube,

1374
00:59:55,780 --> 00:59:58,660
one, sorry about the years long neglect of that.

1375
00:59:58,660 --> 01:00:00,020
Thank you for your patronage.

1376
01:00:00,580 --> 01:00:02,500
But it has been resurrected as McElroy Family.

1377
01:00:02,500 --> 01:00:04,660
So you're already subscribed, but it's worth it to go check.

1378
01:00:04,660 --> 01:00:08,660
And McElroy.family is the website.

1379
01:00:08,660 --> 01:00:11,380
If you would go check it out and follow,

1380
01:00:11,380 --> 01:00:13,540
there's a Twitter account too, at McElroy Family.

1381
01:00:13,540 --> 01:00:16,740
Honestly don't know, might just be a good catch all feed.

1382
01:00:16,740 --> 01:00:18,500
We don't exactly know what we're gonna do with that yet.

1383
01:00:18,500 --> 01:00:20,980
But if you could go subscribe to that channel

1384
01:00:20,980 --> 01:00:22,820
and bookmark that page, we'd sure appreciate it.

1385
01:00:23,700 --> 01:00:26,820
We're really happy with it and we think it came out real neat.

1386
01:00:26,820 --> 01:00:29,060
And that's gonna be for the future,

1387
01:00:29,060 --> 01:00:32,340
like where we're gonna have the McElroy mail,

1388
01:00:32,340 --> 01:00:34,900
our mailing list that you can get stuff through.

1389
01:00:34,900 --> 01:00:38,820
And also the website is gonna be where all tour information

1390
01:00:38,820 --> 01:00:39,780
and there's a merchant link there

1391
01:00:39,780 --> 01:00:41,940
and a link to donate to the show, all that stuff.

1392
01:00:41,940 --> 01:00:45,140
It's all at McElroy.family, M-C-E-L-R-O-Y,

1393
01:00:45,140 --> 01:00:45,940
in case you're curious.

1394
01:00:45,940 --> 01:00:50,900
And also go check out McElroyMerch.com.

1395
01:00:50,900 --> 01:00:53,860
You could see some of that at McElroy.family as well.

1396
01:00:53,860 --> 01:00:57,780
The fucking December pin of the month is so fucking great.

1397
01:00:57,780 --> 01:00:58,740
It is real great.

1398
01:00:58,740 --> 01:01:00,260
There's ornaments on there too.

1399
01:01:00,260 --> 01:01:02,420
There's some good stuff that you wanna get

1400
01:01:02,420 --> 01:01:03,780
all your family and friends.

1401
01:01:03,780 --> 01:01:06,500
And you know that coworker that you drew their name

1402
01:01:06,500 --> 01:01:07,860
for the Secret Santa gift exchange.

1403
01:01:07,860 --> 01:01:10,500
You're like, I literally know nothing about them.

1404
01:01:10,500 --> 01:01:12,260
Get them some of our McElroy Merch.

1405
01:01:12,260 --> 01:01:14,340
It's as good as anything else you would get them.

1406
01:01:14,340 --> 01:01:16,020
Fair, the December pin of the month

1407
01:01:16,020 --> 01:01:20,420
is my job application electronic sign

1408
01:01:20,420 --> 01:01:21,620
that says, you know, on it.

1409
01:01:21,620 --> 01:01:22,820
It's so fucking choice.

1410
01:01:22,820 --> 01:01:23,540
It's really good.

1411
01:01:24,740 --> 01:01:25,300
Anything else?

1412
01:01:26,500 --> 01:01:28,340
Start setting in your Candle Nights questions.

1413
01:01:28,340 --> 01:01:29,780
Yeah, yes, please.

1414
01:01:30,660 --> 01:01:32,500
I wanna thank John Roderick and the Long Winters

1415
01:01:32,500 --> 01:01:33,300
for the use of our theme song,

1416
01:01:33,300 --> 01:01:35,220
It's a departure off the album, Putting the Days to Bed.

1417
01:01:35,220 --> 01:01:38,900
It's a fantastic album, fantastic dude.

1418
01:01:38,900 --> 01:01:41,460
And hey, good holidays gift, I bet.

1419
01:01:41,460 --> 01:01:43,940
I also wanna thank Maximum Fun for having us on the network.

1420
01:01:43,940 --> 01:01:46,740
Definitely wanna shout out that the JV Club

1421
01:01:46,740 --> 01:01:49,540
with Janet Varney has joined the network very recently.

1422
01:01:49,540 --> 01:01:52,020
So if you've sampled the other shows on the network,

1423
01:01:52,020 --> 01:01:54,900
go give that one a try because it's fantastic

1424
01:01:54,900 --> 01:01:57,380
and much better than any of the shows that we make.

1425
01:01:58,100 --> 01:02:00,500
So that's something that we're gonna have to struggle with.

1426
01:02:00,500 --> 01:02:01,380
Do you guys want the final?

1427
01:02:01,380 --> 01:02:03,300
Yes, yeah.

1428
01:02:03,300 --> 01:02:05,220
This final Yahoo was sent in by Graham Roebuck.

1429
01:02:05,220 --> 01:02:07,700
Thank you, it's Yahoo Answers user Al The Pal,

who I'm almost certain I've gotten

1431
01:02:09,220 --> 01:02:10,820
the last question out of before.

1432
01:02:10,820 --> 01:02:16,980
Al The Pal asks, I know cows have udders,

1433
01:02:18,580 --> 01:02:22,100
but do they also have breasts?

1434
01:02:23,860 --> 01:02:25,940
My name is Justin McElroy.
