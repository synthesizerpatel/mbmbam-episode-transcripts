1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:30,800
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:49,520
Hey, what's up? It's time for the Super Bowl. No, no, no, no. What? You gotta say big game.

6
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:59,360
Why? Because if you say S-U-P-E-R bowl, then we'll get sued. Says who? The government.

7
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:04,240
The government. You're making that up. Obama. Obama said so. I know. Obama is the football

8
00:01:04,240 --> 00:01:09,440
commish, and he said that you're not allowed to say those words. If I understood the rules correctly,

9
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:17,440
I could say Super Bowl, but I could not say Super Base. There are three people in the world right

10
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:23,680
now who can say Super B. You aren't one of them, but Boomer, the sports commentator, is one,

11
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:34,880
and also Dan Marino, and also everybody who's playing in the Super Bowl. Do you guys get excited

12
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:42,720
for the big game? I'm excited for the Puppy Bowl. You know, I only watch it for the commercials.

13
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:51,920
Sometimes I think that commercials are better than the game. Justin, you actually can't refer

14
00:01:51,920 --> 00:02:00,560
to the commercials that air during the Super B. You have to call them TV breaks. TV breaks? Or

15
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:11,680
very expensive advertisements. My favorite TV break ever is when that lady has the hammer,

16
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:17,600
and she swings around, and then she throws it through the TV screen. You know the one

17
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:27,840
from 1984? A lot of people don't know that she poops herself. But it's unrelated. I think it

18
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:36,480
was during Big Game 38. It was the very expensive advertisement where the overweight woman who

19
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:41,600
married Tom Arnold got hit by a log. Do you remember that? Griffin, you actually can't say

20
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:51,440
Tom Arnold? Okay, the overweight woman who married the main protagonist from the movie The Stupids.

21
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:55,760
Exactly. Thank you. Thank you very much. I think my favorite is that one. Have you seen that one?

22
00:02:55,760 --> 00:03:01,520
And it's got the animal in it, and he talks, but he says something really funny. And I think it's

23
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:09,920
either about beer or chips. I like the one for beer chips with Spuds McKenzie. You actually can't

24
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:14,640
say Spuds McKenzie. I cannot say Spuds McKenzie. You can say Potatoes McGee and we'll know.

25
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:22,080
Okay. Potatoes McGee, the dog-shaped spokesperson. Thank you. Is that legal? Is that okay? Barely.

26
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:26,080
Barely legal. Speaking of things that are barely okay, this is my brother and brother and me,

27
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:31,600
an advice show. For the modern era, I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy. I'm your

28
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:34,880
middle-est brother, Travis McElroy. I'm your baby brother, Kit Dan Marino.

29
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:38,960
Kit Kenneth Dan-nith Marino. Kay Dan Marino.

30
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:44,640
Kay Dan Marino Jr. What does Kay stand for? Not to be confused with the football guy.

31
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:54,320
Kick. Kick. Kick. Catch with a K. Since we obviously aren't fit to offer any sort of

32
00:03:54,320 --> 00:04:03,120
advice on sport or sporting, let's go to the advice. I'm graduating college this semester,

33
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:08,640
and then I'm up and moving to San Fran, probably not for good. No, I'm sorry. Probably for good.

34
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:12,800
The thing is, I've been dating a wonderful girl here in North Carolina for the past three months

35
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:18,320
or so. She's amazing, but we're not about to do the long-distance thing across three time zones,

36
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:23,600
so we're trying to cut it off. The question is, when is the right time for us to stop dating?

37
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:28,800
Right now, we're trying to gradually transition it into a sexy friendship with pretty good results.

38
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:35,840
Help us, brothers. That's from nearly departed in North Carolina. Oh my god. I think you should do

39
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:40,880
it at the last second. As your car is driving away, lean your head out the window and be like,

40
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:46,480
oh, by the way, we're breaking up. Goodbye. Does she know, right? She knows. She has to know.

41
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:51,600
That doesn't matter, though, because you're actually up and moving to the fucking danger zone.

42
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:59,840
Yeah. You're in deep, deep trouble. Why? We're trying to transition

43
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:04,160
our love into a sexy friendship. Yeah, that's going to work out pretty well, probably.

44
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:12,160
Yeah. Have you not seen any movie with Jennifer Aniston in it, ever? That's all they're about,

45
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:16,400
is how impossible this is, this movie we're trying to do. Did you not see Friends with Benefits or

46
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:24,800
what was that other one? Friendster with Benefits. Buddies. Social Network. Buddies with Perks.

47
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:33,360
Buddy Bollin. Buddy Bollin. Bone and Buddies. Bone and Buddies or Fuck Pal or Air Buddies.

48
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:40,640
Air Buddies or Treasure Buddies. Or Pleasure Buddies. Or MVP for Most Valuable Fuck Buddy.

49
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:51,280
Let's start with a P. Let's start with a P. P-H-U-C-K. Yesterday is the proper time.

50
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:58,960
Is it possible that this dude has found the perfect combination of words to actually make

51
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:05,120
that transition? I know that we all doubt that he said, hey, honey, this is going great, but I'm

52
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:10,960
moving, let's just be sexy friends. But is it possible? Well, they're gradually trans- they

53
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:16,400
are gearing, they're shifting their gears down, right? So it's a sexy friendship now. Next week

54
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:20,000
it'll be regular friendship, the week after that it'll be sort of an acrimonious friendship,

55
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:26,400
and the week after that it'll be like bitter rivals. Right. Arch-nemesis. Arch-nemesis,

56
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:31,520
and then you bounce. And then you're out with that, that you're someone who wants you to die

57
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:37,120
in North Carolina somewhere. They're plotting your death. Which, hey, actually with the trajectory

58
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:43,440
you're on, that may not be too far off of a goof. Yeah. Yeah, it may end up just like that.

59
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:52,080
I mean, I think you need to decide what you want. If you guys just want to continue

60
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:57,440
fooling around, but once you move it never be anything else, you're on the right track. If

61
00:06:57,440 --> 00:07:03,760
you want to preserve the friendship, I think you have to stop with the sexual stuff ASAP,

62
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:09,680
and start to create some sort of friendship outside of that. Otherwise, the only connection

63
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:13,040
you're going to have is physical, and as soon as you go to San Francisco, that's done.

64
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:18,400
You also want to think about the fact that you're, as you said, moving three time zones away,

65
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:23,920
so maybe you want to make sure you have some free and clear time, like a month or two before you

66
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:29,360
leave to kind of say goodbye to everyone, and just have some quality time with all your friends and

67
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:35,200
everything without worrying about this friendship, relationship, sticky morass you've gotten

68
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:44,800
yourself into. So vital. Yeah, maybe try sticking morass. Oh, Justin. What? It was just as Travis

69
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:50,640
said it, I was just saying it a different way. Is it riffing? Is it riffing? Just three bros

70
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:55,440
getting yucked at. Now you're fucked. But hey, here's the good news. If you manage to actually

71
00:07:55,440 --> 00:08:00,080
pull this off, then you should have an advice podcast that we listen to. Call, I'm a warlock.

72
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:08,080
Yeah, wizard time. I'm a sex wizard. Sex wizard with your friend in North Carolina, Guy. Guy,

73
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:17,600
sex wizard, Guy. So congratulations on that. Griffin. Here's a very timely yahoo that has to

74
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:24,640
do with both football and wizardry. It's sent in by Elisa Holifield. It's asked by yahoo user

75
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:32,800
forever Rogers fan, who asks, who would win, Aaron Rodgers or Harry Potter? I know this is really

76
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:37,280
random and hard to compare, but who would win? There's no specific competition, but you should

77
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:43,520
assume they are not playing a football game or having a magical duel, although Aaron could use

78
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:50,000
football skills and Harry could use magical skills. Also, who wins when it comes to moral character?

79
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:56,720
My friend and I literally debated this for 1.5 and a half more, more than one and a half hours.

80
00:08:56,720 --> 00:09:02,240
So this is very important. Yeah, it's serious. Just some background for you too. Aaron Rodgers

81
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:09,120
is the quarterback of the Green Bay Packers. This morning was named the NFL MVP for the year.

82
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:15,360
Oh, so that must mean that the Packers are in the big game. It is. It's actually the Packers

83
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:21,840
v. Packers. They were so good that they put him right in there twice. Can you, isn't that objectively

84
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:27,840
untrue though? Like if they had the most value, what are they using to measure value? Here's the

85
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:32,720
great thing is that their offense is so good, but their defense is the worst in the league. So he is

86
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:38,080
the most valuable. If it weren't for him, we would have like a real major league scenario. I guess

87
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:43,360
sinkhole would just open up and swallow them all. Basically, yeah. He's the only thing keeping them

88
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:51,440
from sinkhole status. Imagine like a bunch of poop, but the poop is held together by glue.

89
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:58,800
So you're saying Aaron Rodgers is the poop glue. Yeah, that's what I'm saying. The most valuable

90
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:06,720
poop glue. In their failed playoff game, he got the most rushing yards of anybody on the field,

91
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:11,600
which usually quarterbacks don't do. That's not very good. He also got all the tackles.

92
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:22,560
And he sold hot dogs. So who'd win, guys? So wait, so the question is not Harry Potter

93
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:29,760
versus Aaron Rodgers, but not in any competition. Yeah. So they're not actually competing. Well,

94
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:34,800
okay. Or you could look at it like in all competitions. Right. Like what if there was

95
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:40,480
a magical duel? I would say probably Aaron Rodgers, because the only way that you can

96
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:47,920
throw that good is with wizarding abilities. Right. I saw him once throw a football through a man.

97
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:57,440
I saw him battle a dragon with a football. Yeah. So I would say that match Rodgers.

98
00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:02,720
If it's a cooking competition, Harry Potter. Why? Because his cupcakes are magical. Okay.

99
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:10,560
Okay. Have you sampled his cupcakes? Yeah. It's in Travis's fanfic. Yeah. In his cupcake

100
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:20,320
fic. It's a Draco slash Harry slash Ron slash buttercream. Is this buttercream made from

101
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:31,120
butterbeer? Scandalous! Harry, I've become tipped in tipsund. I've actually rewritten

102
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:36,640
all of the Harry Potter series, removed all of the female characters and turned them all into

103
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:44,560
18th century fops. Okay. You're gonna say you turned them all into cupcakes. Basically,

104
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:49,520
it's just about cupcakes. The cupcakes aren't alive and don't move or anything. It's just

105
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:56,000
about them like sitting on a shelf. Yeah. Getting magical. It's not very good. I think Aaron Rodgers

106
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:04,720
would probably, like overall, does it being real give you an advantage? Like being an actual thing

107
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:09,680
that exists as opposed to Harry Potter? What are you talking about? Did you not see the Harry Potter

108
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:14,240
movies? Like how could they, how could they film him? Like I saw him, you know? I saw him. I saw

109
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:20,240
him do magic. I saw him and I saw him do magic. You know, people said actually, I saw this on the

110
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:27,600
back of a bazooka joke, bazooka wrapper, Harry Potter is the most successful documentary ever

111
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:34,640
released in the world. A lot of people said you can't release an eight-part documentary, each of

112
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:42,720
which is three hours, not since the Seven Up series. Has anyone attempted such a feat following,

113
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:46,720
you know, young people throughout their years? But I'm actually surprised that they were able

114
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:52,240
to get David Attenborough to narrate it. Yeah. It's pretty amazing. Is he, so he was the guy

115
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:57,920
with the beard. I was wondering where he fit in and why he was there. Well, he wore the beard as a

116
00:12:57,920 --> 00:13:03,280
disguise because as a documentarian, you don't want to like influence your subjects, but also

117
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:09,760
he fucking loves jelly beans. Yeah, some real gorillas in the mission. I'm into that sort of

118
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:18,880
gorilla style filmmaking. What if they played football? Oh, okay. Like on broomsticks? Or no

119
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:25,200
brooms. I don't, that's like saying, okay, Harry Potter, you don't get to use a broom, but Aaron

120
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:30,160
Rogers, you don't get to use your legs. I don't think we should, don't, let's not limit these

121
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:35,440
people. So Harry Potter's on a broomstick. Aaron Rogers is on his legs. If we're just Aaron Rogers.

122
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:40,400
First of all, there is no such thing as like one-on-one street football. Like, no, it's me.

123
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:47,360
That's like, I have a ghost, I have a ghost wide receiver and he definitely caught that.

124
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:50,480
I gotta be honest with you, from the way you're describing the Green Bay Packards,

125
00:13:50,480 --> 00:14:00,480
it doesn't sound that far off. Man, was that a sports joke? It was a good sports joke. I need

126
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:06,080
to go lie down. I've got the papers. I pulled something in my brain. Pulled a chuckle muscle.

127
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:11,760
Harry Potter could just use magic to kill Aaron Rogers, is what I'm afraid of.

128
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:15,920
Aaron Rogers could just use football to kill Harry Potter. But he wouldn't. Like,

129
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:21,760
what you're saying is, like, he wouldn't use, uh, uh, one of the forbidden curses? No,

130
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:27,280
you just use a gun. Well, Aaron Rogers could use a gun too, Travis. Don't be an asshole.

131
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:30,960
No, but I'm just saying, like, I think Harry Potter would kill Aaron Rogers before Aaron

132
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:36,960
Rogers would kill Harry Potter. I agree a hundred percent. You think Harry Potter would kill Aaron

133
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:42,960
Rogers with a gun? Have you ever seen, have you ever seen, like, an interview with Aaron Rogers?

134
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:48,640
Like, he's the sweetest guy. And Harry Potter's just a right asshole. Yeah. He's a murderous,

135
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:53,280
bloodthirsty asshole. Let's go, let's go down the list. How many people has Harry Potter killed?

136
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:58,960
At least one. The Dark Lord. Spoilers. How many people has Aaron Rogers killed? None. Zero people.

137
00:14:58,960 --> 00:15:02,880
He killed my dreams. Harry Potter has killed a hundred percent more people than Aaron Rogers,

138
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:10,640
as far as we know. Yeah. Okay, fine. Yes. I would like to amend this question and make it Aaron

139
00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:16,400
Rogers or Harry Potter, who would win in a gentleman's duel at dawn? So with what? Magic?

140
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:21,920
Aaron Rogers has no magic. Harry Potter gets to use his magic. Aaron Rogers throws a football.

141
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:30,320
Count to ten. Walk. Turn. Throw. Avada Kedavra. Both die. What a tragedy. What a tragedy.

142
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:36,960
Senseless tragedy this was. I bet. Thanks a lot, my brother, my brother, and me. Do we have one

143
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:42,320
listener out there who is not a very big nerd and also is not a very big jock and they're just like,

144
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:52,560
who the fuck are- what the fuck are you talking- What is going on? I'm having an aneurysm. Hey. Hey.

145
00:15:53,440 --> 00:16:00,400
Yeah? I got another question. Okay. Are you ready for it? Yeah. Griffin, what about you? Yes, of

146
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:07,600
course, go. Jesus. Let's do it. Next week, I have to be at home while a security company installs an

147
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:11,840
alarm system in my house. I was told this could take up to three hours. These house calls are

148
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:16,960
always awkward because I never know what to do. Should I sequester myself in another room and let

149
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:22,800
the security dudes work in peace? Should I make small talk? Help me, McElroy. That's from unsure

150
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:29,600
and newly secure. No, don't make small talk. No. This is something- as somebody who works out of

151
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:36,080
my home, this is something I've had to deal with on occasion. My general strategy is to pretend I'm

152
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:41,920
an architect, like Mike Brady, and I'm working upstairs. I'll say, I'm just finishing up some

153
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:46,560
stuff upstairs, so if you guys need me, just yell, and then I hide. Do you know what I almost always

154
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:56,160
do, almost like reflexively, is I do chores. Like, I'm working too. Like, I'll do some dishes. I'll

155
00:16:56,160 --> 00:17:01,920
be like, oh, tell me about it, guys. Woo, backfucking stuff. Right? Every 10 minutes, I just come in

156
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:06,880
with a tray of lemonade and brownies. I'm like, you guys sure you don't want any of these brownies?

157
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:12,160
Wearing an apron and only an apron. You know, I actually, when I worked at Best Buy,

158
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:17,360
I went out on a couple of installs with our installer and went into people's houses and

159
00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:23,760
installed sound systems and home theater stuff. It is the worst thing when the person won't leave

160
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:30,480
the room for two reasons. One, it feels like they're judging every single thing that you do,

161
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:39,280
and they're like, oh, you're going to put a wire there, huh? Okay. But also, they're just there,

162
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:44,080
because even if they make small talk, after like three minutes, the small talk ends and they're

163
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:49,600
still just hovering in the room like a ghost. Yeah. You know, it's funny, Trev. The last time

164
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:57,840
this happened to me was Best Buy installers hanging a TV for me, and one of them actually made a

165
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:03,840
comment. They had to have me come down a couple of times to answer questions, and one guy actually

166
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:10,080
said, I noticed you keep running upstairs. What's going on? Do you want me to chill?

167
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:15,600
Why don't you call G-Nos? It's order is on. Just get to know each other. Let's just bro out,

168
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:20,000
you know? Let's get a pub, which we just hung. I know you got a baller TV. I just hung it.

169
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:24,880
He taps you on the forehead and says, let me get in there, and then he taps you on the heart and

170
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:28,640
then he taps you on the heart and says, and then here. Then let me get in there. Let's just eat

171
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:34,320
some za and watch some tapes. Let me just test this TV out real quick all day. Let's take it

172
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:41,200
for a spin. Let's take it for a watch. You may, finally. When someone comes in your home to do

173
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:46,560
a thing to it, that home is theirs until they leave. That's all right. It's the law of the

174
00:18:46,560 --> 00:18:51,280
land. You might as well just go, because they live there for a bit. You guys are going to live

175
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:57,200
here for a tip and I'll just chill. I say you have like three prepared questions.

176
00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:08,800
Oh my God. And then, do you guys need anything? Are there any things I could point you towards?

177
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:13,040
And then say, well, now I will leave you to do your job because you are professionals and I am

178
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:17,920
in the way. And then you stand quietly facing in the corner. Here's one that you can trot out that

179
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:30,480
I use and maybe you can use. I said, what are my walls made of? I'm imagining you talking to a

180
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:35,600
best buyman with like a bunch of index cards in your hands just like flipping through. I'm like,

181
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:44,560
hey, your shirt is very dirty. Why is that? So do I have a good house? Can I look at your hands?

182
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:49,280
I've been told the hands of a workman are a second home. What's it like to be a member of

183
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:54,960
the working class? I knew you guys were supposed to have blue collars. I didn't know your whole

184
00:19:54,960 --> 00:20:02,320
shirt would be blue. Please explain. What is your tax rate? Interesting. Did you feel ostracized

185
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:09,280
when you went to technical high school? I don't want to. I don't want to. I don't want to. It's

186
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:13,520
not that this is what's so terrible, but I'm like, this is the same thing. Like when I go to the

187
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:22,880
mechanic or whatever, it's not that I look down on people who have a trade. It's that I'm so

188
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:30,880
embarrassed. Yeah, you look up. What I do, people who can make things and hang things and know what

189
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:37,280
my walls are made of. It's so far from anything I have any concept of. I desperately want to know

190
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:44,800
those. I would love to be in that part of that world, but my brain doesn't. I don't know. I don't

191
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:50,880
remember what my walls are made of. I've already forgot. What I find is that I feel the same way,

192
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:57,840
and it's usually because in any other situation, I wouldn't hesitate to expound on my own opinions

193
00:20:57,840 --> 00:21:03,200
and be like, oh yeah, that is good pizza, and it's got this. But when I go to a mechanic and

194
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:08,080
he starts telling me shit is wrong with my car, I just go, yeah, that's probably true. Just take

195
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:13,680
me. I completely agree with you because I'm an idiot. Whenever you pay for any kind of skilled

196
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:19,200
labor, you're basically saying, I can't do this. Please do this for me, and I'll give you money

197
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:24,080
for doing it for me. I don't know. You might as well be crying every time you ask anyone to do

198
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:28,480
something for you along the lines of skilled labor. But you know what else is important? I

199
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:35,840
don't try to improve on that, though. I'm not trying to learn the skill. I'm such a fucking

200
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:42,080
phony. You know what I'll throw out sometimes? Yeah, I just don't have the time. I'd love to

201
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:46,560
get in there and just fucking rip that oil filter out and put in a new one. What are you doing?

202
00:21:46,560 --> 00:21:51,280
Oh, you're doing some soldering, huh? Yeah, I could. Yeah, just who's got the time to solder?

203
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:56,960
Gotta go to the depot, buy the solder juice. I'm out of solder, so if you guys could solder

204
00:21:56,960 --> 00:22:03,120
those things shut or on or whatever it is that we agreed that needed to happen. Yeah, my forge down

205
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:09,680
in the basement. It's out of commish. Yeah, I was hammering away on the old anvil, pulled the

206
00:22:09,680 --> 00:22:15,600
hamstring, and are you guys gonna... I tell you what, if you guys are gonna smelt something later,

207
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:22,320
I'll come back. He who smelt it, dealt it. Am I right, guys? I'm gonna go. Just give me a call

208
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:28,400
when the smell takes over. Oh, my phone's dead. Well, catch you later. What if you did that for

209
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:32,880
everything? You were at fucking Pier 1 Imports buying some plates, and you're like, yeah,

210
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:39,520
I'd make my own plates, but who's got the time? My ceramics wheel is busted. I gotta dry and

211
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:44,960
glaze the ceramic. Like, oh, too busy. You know, the other day, Teresa's dad tried to explain to

212
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:50,960
me how to change my oil. He was like, oh, you just do it. And after like 10 minutes of him explaining

213
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:58,160
it to me, I just stopped him and said, hey, Mike, I'm not gonna do it. Here's the amount of frequency

214
00:22:58,160 --> 00:23:04,800
that I have to do something in order for me to learn how to do it, and that thing is... I'll say

215
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:09,200
four days. If I have to do something like shave every four days, if I had to shave every five

216
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:14,320
days, I'd have someone else do it for me. I'd go pay to have someone do it for me. Getting your oil

217
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:19,440
changed is like what, every eight months? Yeah. Every eight months, every 10,000 miles? Like,

218
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:24,800
that is not a big deal. You know, every time I go get my hair cut, I ask them if they offer

219
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:32,000
shaves. Every time. And the people at Supercuts are pissed. They never have like a...

220
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:39,600
give you like a massage like Jesse's barber does for him. Like an electric massage. I used to get

221
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:43,360
that treatment in Chicago, but I haven't found a place in Austin that can replicate it, but God

222
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:49,520
damn, it makes you feel like the king of some sort of small country. My man, Sonny, will wash my hair

223
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:56,400
if I tip him right. That's about it. It's a weird vibe, having a dude washing your hair. It's weirder

224
00:23:56,400 --> 00:24:02,400
to ask for it because you enjoy it. Sonny, can you do this for me, please? Sonny, please? I don't

225
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:07,040
know how to wash my hair! Sonny, I only wash my hair every five days, so I have to get a guy.

226
00:24:07,040 --> 00:24:15,600
It's not a skill I've taken on. I guess that answers that question. Yeah, I guess that answers

227
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:23,360
that. I'm looking for an activity that my girlfriend and I could do together. We spend a lot of time at

228
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:27,440
home doing nothing, which we enjoy, but we'd like to get out more. What do you suggest?

229
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:38,160
That's from Bored in Burlington. Bored in Burlington. Literally anything. Well, that's not

230
00:24:38,160 --> 00:24:44,960
very helpful. I know, but the question is just so broad. The world is your fucking oyster. Go shuck

231
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:51,440
it. I also have no idea what you enjoy. Yeah, what do you like? Do you want to go to like a vineyard,

232
00:24:51,440 --> 00:25:00,400
or do you want to go like to a monster truck show? It's hard to say. Or both. Man, just go get wasted

233
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:06,080
at a vineyard and then pound some brews at a monster truck rally. Or get real drunk, buy a

234
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:12,320
monster truck, then drive it all over a vineyard. I don't know what people are doing these days.

235
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:19,440
Here's what I like to do when I go out. Go to eat. Yeah. That's something you can try. Have you

236
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:25,600
tried TGI Fridays? Have you tried the dip at TGI Fridays? That's pretty good. They've got this three

237
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:31,840
for $60.99 deal. It's awesome. It's a great deal. And just incredible cheesecake there.

238
00:25:33,040 --> 00:25:41,040
What about, what if the two of you learn to shoot pool, and you go out to local watering holes,

239
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:45,360
and you just get really good at- Hustle some bitches. Well, at first you can't hustle,

240
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:50,080
because I learned this the hard way. You have to get good first. If you just say you're really bad,

241
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:54,640
and then you play pool, and you lose really bad, that's not a hustle. I tried that once. That's

242
00:25:54,640 --> 00:26:00,240
hubris. I went out, and I saw pool hall junkies. I was like, oh, I can do that. And I went, and I

243
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:05,200
lost some games. And I was like, how about we drop $400 on it? And they're like, okay. And I said,

244
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:11,600
rack them. And then I lost $400. Yeah. You can't just all of a sudden start using pool lingo.

245
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:16,800
That's not what a hustle is. I thought that for a while. You take off your jacket dramatically.

246
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:21,600
Yeah. Take off your jacket and be like, rack them, and I'll crack them. And your shirt says,

247
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:33,520
best at pool. Best at pool, 2003. That would be a double hustle. They think you're bad,

248
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:36,800
then they think you're good for a second, and then you go back to being bad. Then you take

249
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:41,600
off your jacket, and they're like, oh, no. Oh, you're actually not. But then you take off that

250
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:45,440
t-shirt, and underneath it is another t-shirt that says, but actually really bad at pool.

251
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:51,360
This is the 10th time I've ever played pool. I got this shirt made just for the occasion.

252
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:58,000
Rack them. People ask what the point of the double hustle is, and usually it plays on pity.

253
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:04,560
And you go, hey, that was the last $400 I have. Please don't take that away. They ask you what

254
00:27:04,560 --> 00:27:09,760
the point is, and you say, I just spend every night at home doing nothing with the old lady.

255
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:16,720
I just had to do something to feel alive. You burn somebody at pool, you hustle them.

256
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:21,520
That's going to sting for a night. If you can make someone wonder why you attempted

257
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:26,320
the double hustle, that'll last a whole lifetime. They'll be trying to puzzle that out.

258
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:29,200
Yeah. So that's one thing you can do.

259
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:30,160
A double hustle.

260
00:27:30,160 --> 00:27:36,640
A double pool hustle. Why don't you make some friends? Why don't you hang out with friends?

261
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:39,200
That's usually a good option, right?

262
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:41,520
Yeah. Go to the movies with them.

263
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:44,240
Yeah, you can go to the movies with them.

264
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:47,040
Spend a couple hours in a Cracker Barrel.

265
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:48,720
Okay. Doing what?

266
00:27:49,280 --> 00:27:49,780
Shopping.

267
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:53,920
That sounds like the pits.

268
00:27:55,680 --> 00:27:58,800
But it'll really make you appreciate your time at home doing nothing.

269
00:27:58,800 --> 00:28:04,560
Hey, this is kind of like being at a flea market, except everyone smells like gravy

270
00:28:04,560 --> 00:28:07,120
and everything costs three times as much. I love it here.

271
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:09,760
Let's stay for a couple hours.

272
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:12,800
Is that Kenny Rogers? No, that's not. Is that Kenny Rogers?

273
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:16,240
Let's hustle people at Giant Checkers.

274
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:17,440
That's actually a lady.

275
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:26,400
You can hustle people at Giant Checkers. No one bets on this. That'd be sweet.

276
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:30,720
There's a whole sort of like gang culture. Like there was around chess.

277
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:37,440
They got a lot of big jawbreakers there at the Cracker Barrel. You could sample all of them.

278
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:42,960
You could spend time making that mechanical parrot repeat dirty words.

279
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:45,200
Yeah. I kind of want to go to Cracker Barrel.

280
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:46,800
Yeah, right?

281
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:49,040
Yeah, that sounds kind of fun.

282
00:28:49,040 --> 00:28:52,400
You know, if you don't like Cracker Barrel, you're an igneau ramus.

283
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:53,440
Oh, God damn it.

284
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:56,960
Wow. That was a deep cut, Trav.

285
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:59,440
Nobody on the planet is going to get that joke.

286
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:03,200
Our dad is going to laugh his fucking ass off.

287
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:10,560
Did you guys know that there is no such thing as a hate crime inside of a Cracker Barrel?

288
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:12,080
Really?

289
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:14,720
If you're in a Cracker Barrel and you do a hate crime,

290
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:18,320
the same hate crime laws don't apply to you because you're in a Cracker Barrel.

291
00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:19,120
I had no idea.

292
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:21,600
Yeah. Why is that?

293
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:26,400
It's just they have the, that's in the Cracker Barrel code of conduct.

294
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:29,840
It's what Obama pushed through Congress last week.

295
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:37,600
It's just, they call it an old-timey, sunrise, farmhouse opportunity for growth.

296
00:29:39,280 --> 00:29:41,600
Hey, some people might see a hate crime here.

297
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:45,520
We see an opportunity to learn about another race.

298
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:53,360
They call it a sunshine, cornstalk, harvest time, annual, autumn breeze murder.

299
00:29:55,120 --> 00:29:55,840
Hate murder.

300
00:29:56,640 --> 00:30:00,320
It's an opportunity to learn about another culture.

301
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:01,280
That's what they say.

302
00:30:01,280 --> 00:30:03,120
It's immersion therapy.

303
00:30:06,160 --> 00:30:08,640
I like this idea of being inside Cracker Barrel

304
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:11,440
and just everything translating into double speak.

305
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:11,680
Yeah.

306
00:30:11,680 --> 00:30:18,400
Yeah, if you're in a Cracker Barrel, for instance, I'll give you an example.

307
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:27,920
If you pay taxes there, now this whatever joke I make is gonna be better than the other word

308
00:30:27,920 --> 00:30:30,240
I was about to say, which is have an abortion.

309
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:32,960
So let's keep going with the taxes thing.

310
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:37,200
I don't have one because I made up one for abortion.

311
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:38,080
I backed off.

312
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:42,000
Okay, but say the same thing that you would have said for abortion but for taxes.

313
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:46,160
Okay, so when you go to Cracker Barrel to pay taxes,

314
00:30:46,160 --> 00:30:57,280
they call it an old-fashioned, sunrise, harvest house, baby dwindling.

315
00:31:00,560 --> 00:31:04,560
It's folksy, but at the same time horrific.

316
00:31:06,160 --> 00:31:07,840
And that's paying taxes.

317
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:12,080
That's what paying taxes is at Cracker Barrel.

318
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:16,560
And they also have a lot of old candy, which is good, which I like.

319
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:21,600
You know, once a courier delivered a paycheck to me in a Cracker Barrel and I was like,

320
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:27,600
ah, fuck, now I gotta get a Cracker Barrel 1099 just for the state of Cracker Barrel.

321
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:31,760
This doesn't make any goddamn sense.

322
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:33,040
Nothing we've said, nothing we've said.

323
00:31:33,040 --> 00:31:36,400
Stupid show, stupid shit, idiotic.

324
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:38,000
Nobody even goes to Cracker Barrel anymore.

325
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:39,280
Nobody knows what we're talking about.

326
00:31:39,920 --> 00:31:43,840
The only person that goes anymore is our dad so he can get those jawbreakers he likes.

327
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:46,640
You know, the white ones with the colored flecks?

328
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:47,440
Oh yeah.

329
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:49,360
But I mean, if it makes you guys feel any better,

330
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:51,760
dad is also the only one still listening at this point.

331
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:52,240
Hi, dad.

332
00:31:52,800 --> 00:31:53,280
Hi, dad.

333
00:31:54,160 --> 00:31:55,760
Hey, dad, we're gonna go to the Money Zone.

334
00:31:55,760 --> 00:31:56,560
You wanna come along?

335
00:31:56,560 --> 00:32:14,000
Hey, Trav, let's do like a call and response like in church.

336
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:15,840
Who is this message for?

337
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:17,040
Michelle.

338
00:32:17,040 --> 00:32:18,720
Who is this message from?

339
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:19,280
Dave.

340
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:21,440
What is the message, Trav?

341
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:26,080
Happy fifth anniversary to my amazing girlfriend, Michelle.

342
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:28,480
Well, not my, it's not my amazing girlfriend.

343
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:29,760
It's Dave's amazing girlfriend, Michelle.

344
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:31,120
You're ruining the rhythm.

345
00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:31,520
Sorry.

346
00:32:31,520 --> 00:32:33,200
Where does she live, Travis?

347
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:34,800
She lives in Cleveland, Justin.

348
00:32:34,800 --> 00:32:36,880
Where is she earning her master's degree?

349
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:40,480
It's in our history.

350
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:42,400
Where does she live?

351
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:44,400
No, he lives in Cincinnati.

352
00:32:44,400 --> 00:32:45,600
Where does he live?

353
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:46,720
He works, ah, fuck.

354
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:50,320
He lives in Cincinnati where he works as a restaurant manager.

355
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:51,520
You should find him.

356
00:32:51,520 --> 00:32:53,120
I too live in Cincinnati.

357
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:55,520
What restaurant do you go to?

358
00:32:55,520 --> 00:32:57,440
And can I get free food there, please?

359
00:32:57,440 --> 00:33:01,680
Do you have anything, if you have any fries coated in a liquid

360
00:33:01,680 --> 00:33:03,920
that used to be a solid, Travis loves that.

361
00:33:03,920 --> 00:33:04,640
Yeah.

362
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:06,640
Cheese, bacon, grease, whatever.

363
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:07,520
Anything, dude.

364
00:33:07,520 --> 00:33:09,920
One might say that that is Travis's core competency.

365
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:12,480
They, they're both native Floridians.

366
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:15,680
And they met while they were students

367
00:33:15,680 --> 00:33:17,920
at Florida State University, go Knowles.

368
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:21,520
And now it's cut off the end of the sentence here.

369
00:33:21,520 --> 00:33:24,480
It says she loves musicals, visiting museums,

370
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:26,160
and watching Law.

371
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:29,120
Larry King Live reruns.

372
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:30,960
Law and Order SVU.

373
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:33,920
Law and Order VUS.

374
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:38,800
So happy fifth anniversary, Dave and Michelle.

375
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:40,960
Happy fifth anniversary, you guys.

376
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:45,520
Justin, who is, who is our next one for and from and about?

377
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:48,080
This was for a dog.

378
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:49,200
Oh no.

379
00:33:50,160 --> 00:33:52,240
Is our favorite dog listener, Ebby.

380
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:54,640
This is from Kirsten, who is her owner.

381
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,160
And what does she have to say, Griff?

382
00:33:58,880 --> 00:33:59,520
She has to say,

383
00:33:59,520 --> 00:34:01,920
woof, woof, woof, woof, woof, kibble.

384
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:05,200
Okay, but translated, Travis, how would you translate that loosely?

385
00:34:05,840 --> 00:34:08,080
Happy anniversary, Badoodly Kitten.

386
00:34:08,080 --> 00:34:09,600
I adopted you a year ago,

387
00:34:09,600 --> 00:34:12,320
and I can't imagine what my life was like before.

388
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:15,600
You are my constant companion, my best friend,

389
00:34:15,600 --> 00:34:17,680
and my snuggle, snuggle bug.

390
00:34:17,680 --> 00:34:18,960
I love you so much.

391
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:21,760
I'm gonna edit out that part of you saying that.

392
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:25,120
And just make a looped MP3 that I go to sleep to.

393
00:34:25,120 --> 00:34:27,040
Because I think that would make me feel really safe.

394
00:34:28,080 --> 00:34:29,040
I'm glad.

395
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:29,360
Thank you.

396
00:34:29,360 --> 00:34:32,720
Is it possible that this is not a dog animal,

397
00:34:32,720 --> 00:34:36,160
and that this is some sort of weird domination S&M thing,

398
00:34:36,160 --> 00:34:38,160
and Ebby is her man dog?

399
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:40,880
You think maybe it's like a Randy Jackson dog?

400
00:34:40,880 --> 00:34:42,480
Like, it's like a Randy Jackson.

401
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:44,480
It's like a, it's, it's like a...

402
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:46,240
Timbaland.

403
00:34:46,240 --> 00:34:48,560
Is it like a Timbaland dog scenario,

404
00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:52,000
where it's like a domination dog S&M thing,

405
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:53,840
only I guess it's like a gentle S&M,

406
00:34:53,840 --> 00:34:55,040
because they like to cuddle?

407
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:56,560
Yeah.

408
00:34:56,560 --> 00:34:58,560
That's probably exactly what it is, Griffin.

409
00:34:58,560 --> 00:35:00,560
Thank you for taking this really sweet message

410
00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:02,400
from a dog owner to her pet,

411
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:04,000
and just really ruining it.

412
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:04,800
I petted it.

413
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:06,000
I petted it too hard.

414
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,640
You petted the goof too hard,

415
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:09,600
then you broke its neck.

416
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:13,520
Hey, guys.

417
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:15,920
Have you heard of Gimo Games?

418
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:17,200
Yeah.

419
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:17,920
Yeah?

420
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:19,520
They're making this iPhone game, right?

421
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:21,200
It's called Monster Guru.

422
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:23,360
It's like a hand-drawn version of Pokemon.

423
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:25,680
I know.

424
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:27,280
Using the iPhone's geo-tracking,

425
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:30,720
the character in the game moves as you move in real life.

426
00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:37,200
And we have a cameo that somebody in their Kickstarter video

427
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:39,120
was totally wearing our t-shirt, so...

428
00:35:39,120 --> 00:35:39,680
Nice.

429
00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:41,200
You gotta go find that.

430
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:44,160
They just want you to donate to their Kickstarter.

431
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:46,400
And I don't think that's asking too much.

432
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:49,120
No, I think this game is gonna be just absolutely dope.

433
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:53,200
And so you, as the kind public,

434
00:35:54,160 --> 00:35:55,280
should fund it.

435
00:35:55,280 --> 00:35:58,000
And to do that, you should go to Gimogames.com,

436
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:02,720
and that's G-I-M-O-Games.com slash fund,

437
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:06,160
and then donate to their iPhone game on Kickstarter.

438
00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:08,240
Is Pikachu in the game?

439
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:10,320
No, it's like...

440
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:12,400
There's like a hand-drawn Pikachu.

441
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:17,280
So it'll look like a it'll look like a caricature of Wilford Brimley, basically.

442
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:18,320
But a hand.

443
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:20,400
It's basically Pikachu with a mustache.

444
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:20,640
Right.

445
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:22,400
I want it.

446
00:36:24,080 --> 00:36:27,120
I know, Griffin, you're speaking his language, Gimogames,

447
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,320
and Griffin is ready for it.

448
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:32,960
So I'm ready for it,

449
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:34,960
but the only way we're gonna get Griffin to play this game

450
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:39,200
is if we go to Gimogames, that's G-I-M-O-Games.com,

451
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:43,600
forward slash fund and help set them up.

452
00:36:43,600 --> 00:36:45,920
So do that and tell them, you know,

453
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:48,800
that we love them and that you love them

454
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:50,320
and you can't wait to play their game.

455
00:36:51,680 --> 00:36:52,720
I was so inspired.

456
00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:54,640
I thought I would write them a theme song.

457
00:36:54,640 --> 00:36:55,360
Please do.

458
00:36:55,360 --> 00:36:56,320
For their game?

459
00:36:56,320 --> 00:36:56,960
Yeah, for their game.

460
00:36:57,520 --> 00:36:58,480
Monster Guru!

461
00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:01,600
Monster Guru!

462
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:04,240
It's you and Peehee!

463
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:08,000
I catch you on my iPhone!

464
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:11,920
Monster Guru, you're my best bud

465
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:14,800
and the world we must defend.

466
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:19,920
Monster Guru, let's go fight other monsters.

467
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:23,920
Our courage will pull us through!

468
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:26,720
You teach me and I'll teach you!

469
00:37:27,600 --> 00:37:29,520
Monster Guru!

470
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:31,600
This is the, this is bad tabulature.

471
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:36,640
Gotta catch em all!

472
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:38,880
Gotta catch all the monsters!

473
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:42,560
MonsterGuru.com, what's the website?

474
00:37:44,240 --> 00:37:45,520
That was the original art,

475
00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:46,960
that was the original piece of art

476
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:49,200
under fair use of the Creative Commons license.

477
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:53,760
Did you guys ever watch Pokemon

478
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:56,000
and think how great it would be

479
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,000
if every night, if I had Pokemon,

480
00:37:58,000 --> 00:37:59,520
what I would do is every night

481
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:02,720
I would poke each of them and say,

482
00:38:02,720 --> 00:38:04,080
nope, not ready to eat yet.

483
00:38:04,080 --> 00:38:05,920
And then go to sleep.

484
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:07,200
Cause I think that would really cute them

485
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:07,840
on their toes.

486
00:38:07,840 --> 00:38:10,640
Yeah, and then just after like a couple weeks of that,

487
00:38:10,640 --> 00:38:12,160
one of them disappears.

488
00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:13,280
One of them goes away.

489
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:15,920
How come they never ate their Pokemon?

490
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:17,200
Would that be a sin against Christ?

491
00:38:19,520 --> 00:38:22,640
It's the best sin, I bet it tastes so good.

492
00:38:22,640 --> 00:38:25,440
I'm sorry, Monster Guru, that wasn't a very good,

493
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:26,480
I'll catch you on the flip.

494
00:38:27,600 --> 00:38:28,560
Once you get your game out,

495
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:30,880
I'm gonna record you a fresh theme song.

496
00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:34,640
Send me a beta, maybe with a few monsters pre-caught.

497
00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:37,200
A little bonus, a little perk for your boy.

498
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:42,160
For doing such a great job on our theme song.

499
00:38:42,160 --> 00:38:43,520
I just got my guitar restored.

500
00:38:43,520 --> 00:38:44,480
Could you hear the quality?

501
00:38:45,120 --> 00:38:45,840
I could.

502
00:38:45,840 --> 00:38:47,120
What kind of, what'd you go with, Elixir?

503
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:49,760
Nah, I just wanted to play an old D'Addario's.

504
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:51,920
You know, the man is the instrument, not the strings.

505
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:54,960
How many strings did you put back on it?

506
00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:55,280
12.

507
00:38:55,840 --> 00:38:58,800
How about, there's a bunch.

508
00:38:58,800 --> 00:38:59,520
How about this one?

509
00:38:59,520 --> 00:39:00,960
It was sent in by Emily Wall.

510
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:01,520
Thank you, Emily.

511
00:39:01,520 --> 00:39:02,080
It's by Yahoo!

512
00:39:02,080 --> 00:39:04,320
Answers user Horde, who asks,

513
00:39:05,600 --> 00:39:07,280
can't stress up as firefighters

514
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:09,360
in order to save people from a burning building.

515
00:39:09,360 --> 00:39:10,480
Good idea or not?

516
00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:15,360
What?

517
00:39:15,360 --> 00:39:16,160
Not.

518
00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:17,680
Not, that was easy.

519
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:21,680
If nothing else, I just can't believe

520
00:39:21,680 --> 00:39:23,520
that they've had the proper training.

521
00:39:23,520 --> 00:39:24,480
Well, Yahoo!

522
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:28,880
Answers user VivaLaRosa777 responded, why not?

523
00:39:28,880 --> 00:39:30,480
I think it is a very noble idea

524
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:32,640
and it will make the kids want to serve the public

525
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:34,640
and care for people and help people in general.

526
00:39:34,640 --> 00:39:36,720
A very fine idea indeed.

527
00:39:38,640 --> 00:39:39,440
Is it?

528
00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:40,560
So he has a good point.

529
00:39:40,560 --> 00:39:43,040
This is like AmeriCorps, isn't it?

530
00:39:43,040 --> 00:39:45,120
Isn't this what that is, the Peace Corps?

531
00:39:45,120 --> 00:39:49,120
It's like Newt Gingrich's Army of Children Janitors.

532
00:39:49,120 --> 00:39:49,600
Exactly.

533
00:39:50,160 --> 00:39:54,640
You can pay 30 firefighters the wage of one firefighter

534
00:39:54,640 --> 00:39:58,880
and you will only lose like four kids per fire, I bet.

535
00:39:58,880 --> 00:40:02,160
And lots of people know that because of the extra innocence,

536
00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:03,600
children are far less flammable.

537
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:07,360
I think that you could just take this idea

538
00:40:07,360 --> 00:40:10,320
and really run with it and be like,

539
00:40:10,320 --> 00:40:12,480
children dressed up as doctors.

540
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:13,200
That's great.

541
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:14,480
That's great.

542
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:19,440
And we can have like our own kids crusade, right?

543
00:40:20,320 --> 00:40:21,200
We could do that again.

544
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:23,600
This is actually what Kid Nation was about.

545
00:40:23,600 --> 00:40:24,960
Oh, I did.

546
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:27,440
A bunch of kid firefighters and kid doctors.

547
00:40:28,320 --> 00:40:29,920
Cutting therapists.

548
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:30,160
Right.

549
00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:36,080
It's a bad idea?

550
00:40:36,080 --> 00:40:37,040
Well, here's the thing.

551
00:40:37,040 --> 00:40:38,880
Sometimes you've got to keep your head down,

552
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:40,160
right, to get out of the smoke.

553
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:43,120
Kids' heads are naturally down.

554
00:40:43,120 --> 00:40:45,680
That's like the one thing they have on me is that.

555
00:40:46,320 --> 00:40:47,760
They're lower to the ground.

556
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:48,800
They're lower to the ground.

557
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:52,240
They require less air to go in their tiny, beautiful lungs.

558
00:40:52,240 --> 00:40:56,480
You know how you and I have to stop, drop, and roll

559
00:40:56,480 --> 00:40:57,280
if we catch on fire?

560
00:40:57,280 --> 00:40:59,680
Kids that have that down to two steps,

561
00:40:59,680 --> 00:41:00,960
they can just stop and roll.

562
00:41:01,520 --> 00:41:03,520
They're already so low to the ground.

563
00:41:03,520 --> 00:41:03,760
Yeah.

564
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:06,080
And they're not really contributing much to society.

565
00:41:06,080 --> 00:41:09,120
So if we lose a couple, like, what are we out?

566
00:41:09,120 --> 00:41:10,480
They weren't even paying taxes.

567
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:11,520
Yeah.

568
00:41:13,600 --> 00:41:16,160
They won't have families that we'll have to take care of.

569
00:41:16,160 --> 00:41:16,400
Yeah.

570
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:21,840
I think that the economy is as bad as it is

571
00:41:21,840 --> 00:41:24,080
because all these freeloading kids everywhere.

572
00:41:24,080 --> 00:41:24,480
Yeah.

573
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:26,480
So maybe we put them to work, you know?

574
00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:30,880
Like, you know, as doctors, you know, lawyers, miners.

575
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:31,440
Here's the thing.

576
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:34,160
You never hear about, like, in the news,

577
00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:37,760
like, a dad waking up and the house is on fire

578
00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:39,280
and so he saves all of his kids.

579
00:41:39,280 --> 00:41:40,400
You never hear about that.

580
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:42,640
It's always a kid or a dog or a pig.

581
00:41:42,640 --> 00:41:43,360
Right.

582
00:41:43,360 --> 00:41:43,840
Yeah.

583
00:41:43,840 --> 00:41:45,680
It's always one of those three things.

584
00:41:45,680 --> 00:41:46,720
I don't know why that is.

585
00:41:46,720 --> 00:41:50,240
Maybe kids have natural fire senses.

586
00:41:50,240 --> 00:41:54,320
Yeah. Maybe it's that they're beautiful, sweet little lungs.

587
00:41:54,320 --> 00:41:56,480
Don't need as much air and their head's so low.

588
00:41:57,040 --> 00:41:57,520
And maybe they get-

589
00:41:57,520 --> 00:42:00,080
Is it possible the dads are just really forgetful?

590
00:42:00,080 --> 00:42:02,720
The dads just lay there and, like, die.

591
00:42:04,240 --> 00:42:05,280
Well, this is the end.

592
00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:06,080
Well, this is it.

593
00:42:06,080 --> 00:42:06,800
Guess the time for,

594
00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:08,800
I knew I should have gotten a dog!

595
00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:10,800
That's what he said to his own father.

596
00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:12,720
The dads are just happy for a way out.

597
00:42:12,720 --> 00:42:12,960
Yeah.

598
00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:17,040
I thought my stupid ass son would come rescue me.

599
00:42:17,040 --> 00:42:23,120
The kids, they're so low and they get in the heat of the moment,

600
00:42:23,120 --> 00:42:25,600
pun intended, they get so diesel

601
00:42:25,600 --> 00:42:28,880
and they just pull their dad all the way downstairs.

602
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:31,920
They get fully gamma-rayed and they just go for it.

603
00:42:31,920 --> 00:42:34,560
They freak out and they get super D's

604
00:42:34,560 --> 00:42:36,240
and they just pull them downstairs

605
00:42:36,240 --> 00:42:38,160
and then they save the whole day.

606
00:42:38,720 --> 00:42:38,960
Yeah.

607
00:42:38,960 --> 00:42:41,840
You know, wouldn't you hate that to be that kid that, like, doesn't

608
00:42:43,040 --> 00:42:45,280
and, like, dad comes outside and he's, like, coughing

609
00:42:45,280 --> 00:42:47,040
and, like, you know, covered in soot and stuff.

610
00:42:47,040 --> 00:42:48,240
He's, like, where the fuck were you?

611
00:42:48,240 --> 00:42:48,640
Daniel!

612
00:42:49,840 --> 00:42:52,080
I waited in my bedroom for an hour and a half.

613
00:42:52,720 --> 00:42:54,320
I want to hit you guys with this.

614
00:42:54,320 --> 00:42:58,320
People say, oh, children of firefighters, that's so dangerous.

615
00:42:58,320 --> 00:42:59,600
Let me ask you this.

616
00:42:59,600 --> 00:43:03,840
When was the last time you heard of a child firefighter dying?

617
00:43:04,480 --> 00:43:04,800
Never?

618
00:43:06,080 --> 00:43:07,760
Maybe they're better at it than you think.

619
00:43:07,760 --> 00:43:11,520
When have you ever heard of a child brain surgeon

620
00:43:11,520 --> 00:43:13,920
killing a person by cutting their brain wrong?

621
00:43:13,920 --> 00:43:15,280
Never.

622
00:43:15,280 --> 00:43:18,080
They are batting a thousand vis-a-vis brain surgery.

623
00:43:19,040 --> 00:43:19,440
Yeah.

624
00:43:19,440 --> 00:43:23,360
I think kids are maybe way better at it than you give them credit for.

625
00:43:23,360 --> 00:43:26,240
You know, you just point a kid at a burning building and tell them,

626
00:43:26,240 --> 00:43:28,160
hey, Gullah Gullah Allen's in there.

627
00:43:28,160 --> 00:43:28,800
Go get him out.

628
00:43:28,800 --> 00:43:30,000
Go get Gullah Gullah.

629
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:32,080
Stay, stay low.

630
00:43:32,640 --> 00:43:33,280
Stay low.

631
00:43:34,240 --> 00:43:35,600
What would Binya Binya do?

632
00:43:35,600 --> 00:43:36,400
He'd crouch.

633
00:43:36,400 --> 00:43:38,080
What would Binya, shh, like me?

634
00:43:40,160 --> 00:43:42,640
You know, I went to a child therapist once

635
00:43:42,640 --> 00:43:44,320
and I was really depressed.

636
00:43:44,320 --> 00:43:48,320
And now I eat like two packages of cookies a day and I feel great.

637
00:43:49,120 --> 00:43:50,480
I'm so happy all the time.

638
00:43:51,040 --> 00:43:52,960
Kids have it figured out, man.

639
00:43:52,960 --> 00:43:55,920
They know not to be firefighters because it's dangerous.

640
00:43:57,280 --> 00:43:58,160
So they don't do it.

641
00:43:58,800 --> 00:44:01,120
Maybe kids are smarter than we give them credit for.

642
00:44:01,120 --> 00:44:04,640
If you think about all this stupid shit that we have to do day to day,

643
00:44:04,640 --> 00:44:08,560
and I don't just mean lying to your mechanic that you know how to do things.

644
00:44:08,560 --> 00:44:10,640
I mean like everything, you know?

645
00:44:10,640 --> 00:44:15,280
You know, burying loved ones, paying your mortgage.

646
00:44:16,240 --> 00:44:18,400
Like kids don't have to do any of it.

647
00:44:18,400 --> 00:44:22,560
And we think that we have to teach them so they can be ready to,

648
00:44:22,560 --> 00:44:25,120
man, I think they got it all figured out.

649
00:44:25,120 --> 00:44:26,480
They already cracked the case.

650
00:44:27,040 --> 00:44:30,720
It's like the Benjamin Button of having shit figured out.

651
00:44:30,720 --> 00:44:35,040
Like they are living it a hundred percent from the start.

652
00:44:35,040 --> 00:44:36,880
And then we just whittle that away.

653
00:44:36,880 --> 00:44:40,640
Like the wisdom that they have.

654
00:44:40,640 --> 00:44:44,640
So you're trying to set up like a Logan's Run scenario.

655
00:44:45,360 --> 00:44:46,160
Yes.

656
00:44:46,160 --> 00:44:46,560
Okay.

657
00:44:46,560 --> 00:44:47,520
Exactly.

658
00:44:47,520 --> 00:44:48,800
That's exactly what I'm saying.

659
00:44:48,800 --> 00:44:53,520
Where we don't have, maybe we don't need a bunch of grown up firefighters.

660
00:44:53,520 --> 00:44:58,480
If none of us know how to build houses or make fire because we're all kids,

661
00:44:59,200 --> 00:45:00,800
then we won't need it.

662
00:45:00,800 --> 00:45:02,240
You know what else you don't hear about?

663
00:45:02,240 --> 00:45:03,200
Kid arsonists.

664
00:45:03,840 --> 00:45:04,480
Yeah.

665
00:45:04,480 --> 00:45:06,640
Kids are the ones setting the fires.

666
00:45:06,640 --> 00:45:08,560
Put out your own goddamn fires.

667
00:45:08,560 --> 00:45:13,280
You know, a baby president didn't get us into the Vietnam War.

668
00:45:13,280 --> 00:45:13,760
That's right.

669
00:45:13,760 --> 00:45:14,720
So there's that.

670
00:45:14,720 --> 00:45:16,160
Baby presidents never gotten us.

671
00:45:16,160 --> 00:45:18,400
How many wars has baby president gotten us in?

672
00:45:18,400 --> 00:45:20,320
A baby president?

673
00:45:20,320 --> 00:45:22,880
All the baby presidents all together, their careers combined?

674
00:45:23,440 --> 00:45:25,040
They kept a balanced budget for our country.

675
00:45:25,040 --> 00:45:26,560
You know, it's funny.

676
00:45:26,560 --> 00:45:31,680
No baby president got us into Vietnam, but one lone baby soldier got us out.

677
00:45:31,680 --> 00:45:35,280
Oh, God.

678
00:45:35,280 --> 00:45:37,440
I can't wait to see Baby Brigade this summer.

679
00:45:37,440 --> 00:45:38,160
Yeah, me too.

680
00:45:39,200 --> 00:45:40,160
Band of babies.

681
00:45:41,840 --> 00:45:46,240
They're making a dirty dozen with babies, but there's only eight of them because babies are stupid.

682
00:45:47,360 --> 00:45:48,960
You don't know how many there are, baby.

683
00:45:48,960 --> 00:45:49,280
Okay.

684
00:45:49,280 --> 00:45:50,080
I've got to show you.

685
00:45:50,080 --> 00:45:51,440
I'm going to pitch it to you guys.

686
00:45:51,440 --> 00:45:52,000
All right.

687
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:53,200
Band of little brothers.

688
00:45:56,720 --> 00:45:58,080
Just a bunch of little brothers.

689
00:45:58,080 --> 00:46:02,400
What about a shot for shot remake of the entire series of Lost,

690
00:46:02,400 --> 00:46:05,040
but everyone's babies and it's called Baby Island.

691
00:46:07,840 --> 00:46:09,200
Confusing Baby Island.

692
00:46:10,240 --> 00:46:11,280
I'd watch that.

693
00:46:11,280 --> 00:46:12,320
Yeah, I would watch that too.

694
00:46:13,600 --> 00:46:16,720
The smoke monsters made of diapers.

695
00:46:18,800 --> 00:46:20,320
And it's also called Gullah Gullah Island.

696
00:46:20,320 --> 00:46:22,720
It's called Gullah Gullah Island, the babies edition.

697
00:46:22,720 --> 00:46:25,600
Except Locke is still an adult, still played by the same guy.

698
00:46:25,600 --> 00:46:26,640
Everyone else is babies.

699
00:46:26,640 --> 00:46:27,440
Mm-hmm.

700
00:46:27,440 --> 00:46:28,400
He looks like a baby.

701
00:46:28,400 --> 00:46:29,120
He looks like a baby.

702
00:46:29,120 --> 00:46:29,440
I know.

703
00:46:29,440 --> 00:46:31,920
And he's in a diaper, so he's very confused the whole time.

704
00:46:31,920 --> 00:46:34,720
You guys remember Honey, I Blew Up the Kids?

705
00:46:35,520 --> 00:46:40,080
John Locke looks like halfway between baby and blown up, doesn't he?

706
00:46:41,120 --> 00:46:42,080
He does.

707
00:46:42,080 --> 00:46:42,880
I guess I can see that.

708
00:46:42,880 --> 00:46:43,360
Like a tall-

709
00:46:43,360 --> 00:46:45,680
You put him in overalls and a curly wig.

710
00:46:45,680 --> 00:46:47,600
Imagine a tall bipedal baby.

711
00:46:48,400 --> 00:46:49,920
That is what we're talking about.

712
00:46:49,920 --> 00:46:53,200
It's cool though because he's got a giant M&M in his shirt pocket.

713
00:46:53,200 --> 00:46:57,440
Is it weird that when I talk about babies, I have to talk in this voice

714
00:46:57,440 --> 00:46:59,920
so I don't wake up the imaginary baby in my room?

715
00:47:00,960 --> 00:47:02,640
I don't think that's weird.

716
00:47:02,640 --> 00:47:02,880
Okay.

717
00:47:04,560 --> 00:47:05,280
I don't do it.

718
00:47:05,280 --> 00:47:06,160
I don't do it.

719
00:47:06,160 --> 00:47:07,680
I don't, it's not a conscious decision.

720
00:47:08,720 --> 00:47:12,080
Is there an age cutoff for imaginary baby that you talk to in your room?

721
00:47:12,080 --> 00:47:15,360
I just, I just want to be soft, you know?

722
00:47:15,360 --> 00:47:17,360
Is imaginary baby there right now, Griffin?

723
00:47:17,360 --> 00:47:19,360
Babies aren't tough, you know, guys.

724
00:47:19,360 --> 00:47:20,160
So don't get rough.

725
00:47:20,160 --> 00:47:21,280
Let's not get rough with these babies.

726
00:47:21,280 --> 00:47:24,080
Do you ever sit in a, do you have a rocker in your office

727
00:47:24,080 --> 00:47:26,960
in which you snuggle and rock your imaginary baby?

728
00:47:27,600 --> 00:47:30,560
It's not a real, it's not a real imaginary baby.

729
00:47:30,560 --> 00:47:33,280
I'm just saying, I talk like there is one.

730
00:47:33,920 --> 00:47:36,640
I know, I know it's not a real imaginary baby, sweetie.

731
00:47:36,640 --> 00:47:38,560
If you guys wouldn't mind, just like keep it down.

732
00:47:38,560 --> 00:47:39,920
Keep your voices down a little bit.

733
00:47:40,720 --> 00:47:41,520
What's his name?

734
00:47:41,520 --> 00:47:42,400
It's adorable.

735
00:47:42,400 --> 00:47:44,720
His name is Dor, Dor, Dorp.

736
00:47:46,960 --> 00:47:48,080
Wait, hold on.

737
00:47:48,080 --> 00:47:54,240
Did you name your imaginary baby Dorp?

738
00:47:54,240 --> 00:47:56,720
He sounded like the head of the House of Lannister.

739
00:48:01,120 --> 00:48:01,840
Oh, God.

740
00:48:03,360 --> 00:48:06,640
I like the one where your imaginary baby taught me how to play golf.

741
00:48:10,480 --> 00:48:12,640
And Tim Conway has Dorp.

742
00:48:12,640 --> 00:48:16,960
He's short because he's a baby.

743
00:48:18,880 --> 00:48:21,120
It's an imaginary baby that lives in Griffith's heart.

744
00:48:22,560 --> 00:48:23,040
Dorp.

745
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:27,520
You know, when I, when I go, whenever I go hiking,

746
00:48:27,520 --> 00:48:29,520
I always bring a big bag of Dorp.

747
00:48:33,760 --> 00:48:34,320
Delicious.

748
00:48:35,040 --> 00:48:35,840
Hey, guys.

749
00:48:35,840 --> 00:48:36,400
Yeah.

750
00:48:36,400 --> 00:48:38,640
I would like to keep the chuckles going.

751
00:48:38,640 --> 00:48:39,840
I will leave.

752
00:48:40,400 --> 00:48:41,040
I will leave the show forever.

753
00:48:41,040 --> 00:48:42,880
We had some requests on Twitter.

754
00:48:42,880 --> 00:48:45,280
I will get up and I will leave the country.

755
00:48:45,280 --> 00:48:47,920
People wanted me to do a sad lib, so I wrote one.

756
00:48:49,200 --> 00:48:53,120
I think, I know that you guys don't usually cotton to these,

757
00:48:53,120 --> 00:48:55,680
but I think you'll really like this one.

758
00:48:55,680 --> 00:48:58,160
I've been, I took a creative writing course.

759
00:48:58,160 --> 00:49:00,320
Just, just go, just go, just go, just go.

760
00:49:00,320 --> 00:49:00,960
Just do it.

761
00:49:03,520 --> 00:49:05,440
It was another moist night in Boner City.

762
00:49:05,440 --> 00:49:08,560
It's a, why is it, hold on, stop, stop, stop, stop.

763
00:49:08,560 --> 00:49:09,920
It always starts with moist.

764
00:49:09,920 --> 00:49:11,200
And I think if you're going to do this,

765
00:49:11,200 --> 00:49:13,440
you may as well do it right and mix it up.

766
00:49:14,800 --> 00:49:16,240
And I'm just saying, it always starts with moist.

767
00:49:16,240 --> 00:49:18,160
So if you're going to do this awful thing, do it better.

768
00:49:19,680 --> 00:49:23,040
It was another uncomfortably wet night in Boner City

769
00:49:23,040 --> 00:49:25,760
and I was as shitty as an incorporeal wiener.

770
00:49:25,760 --> 00:49:29,840
I just ordered another ice dong from the scabby bartender Usher

771
00:49:29,840 --> 00:49:34,080
when I fractured my gaze on a hypertension beauty across the bar.

772
00:49:34,080 --> 00:49:36,480
I made my way over facetiously.

773
00:49:36,480 --> 00:49:38,960
Pardon my genocide, I defenestrated,

774
00:49:38,960 --> 00:49:42,560
but you have the most erect mandible I have ever floundered.

775
00:49:42,560 --> 00:49:45,280
Oh, is that an aardvark in your flibberty gibbet

776
00:49:45,280 --> 00:49:48,240
or you just boner de bogart me, she ruminated.

777
00:49:48,240 --> 00:49:50,320
Let's ping pong this prestidigitation

778
00:49:50,320 --> 00:49:52,640
and get down to tomfoolery, I rucketed.

779
00:49:52,640 --> 00:49:54,080
What's your name, fiddlesticks?

780
00:49:54,640 --> 00:49:57,920
Bunny hug geronimo, she said with a wedding on her face.

781
00:49:57,920 --> 00:50:01,600
And you, maverick, maverick flesh daddy.

782
00:50:01,600 --> 00:50:04,560
And with that, we climbed onto my laser comb

783
00:50:04,560 --> 00:50:10,800
and cudgled all night long.

784
00:50:10,800 --> 00:50:12,080
That was your longest one yet.

785
00:50:12,640 --> 00:50:13,760
I'm so sorry.

786
00:50:13,760 --> 00:50:15,040
It was a nightmare, Travis.

787
00:50:15,040 --> 00:50:16,320
It was a waking nightmare.

788
00:50:17,680 --> 00:50:20,080
But did you guys like all the dramatic tension?

789
00:50:20,080 --> 00:50:22,320
There was build, there was character development.

790
00:50:23,440 --> 00:50:26,320
The vast majority of my friends are male

791
00:50:26,320 --> 00:50:29,440
and are all mutual friends.

792
00:50:29,440 --> 00:50:30,240
I am a lady.

793
00:50:30,800 --> 00:50:32,400
While I care for all of them,

794
00:50:32,400 --> 00:50:34,800
I have romantic feelings for one in particular

795
00:50:34,800 --> 00:50:37,280
who has mutual feelings for me.

796
00:50:37,280 --> 00:50:39,200
However, I get to feel that some of the others

797
00:50:39,200 --> 00:50:41,520
may have romantic feelings towards me as well.

798
00:50:41,520 --> 00:50:42,880
How do I handle the situation

799
00:50:43,440 --> 00:50:45,760
so that the least amount of people get their feelings hurt?

800
00:50:45,760 --> 00:50:47,840
That's from Worried in Washington.

801
00:50:49,200 --> 00:50:49,700
Damn.

802
00:50:50,560 --> 00:50:52,560
Damn, girl, Vixen.

803
00:50:52,560 --> 00:50:53,680
You gotta date all of them?

804
00:50:54,240 --> 00:50:55,440
Date them all at once, girl.

805
00:50:55,440 --> 00:50:56,240
Date them all.

806
00:50:56,240 --> 00:50:56,740
Damn.

807
00:50:56,740 --> 00:51:00,980
Tears. Ain't you never seen Wings?

808
00:51:03,860 --> 00:51:06,420
I love that season where she's dating both brothers.

809
00:51:07,380 --> 00:51:08,580
It was a weird season.

810
00:51:08,580 --> 00:51:10,420
And then Roy got in the mix.

811
00:51:10,420 --> 00:51:10,980
Yeah, you know.

812
00:51:10,980 --> 00:51:12,020
And Lowell was there.

813
00:51:12,580 --> 00:51:15,540
I actually just watched the fifth season

814
00:51:15,540 --> 00:51:17,860
Dawson's Creek episode, Appetite for Destruction,

815
00:51:18,420 --> 00:51:24,580
where the gang has a dinner at Graham's Place in Boston.

816
00:51:24,580 --> 00:51:29,380
And it's when Jen and Dawson get back together.

817
00:51:29,380 --> 00:51:32,420
And of course, this group has paired off

818
00:51:32,420 --> 00:51:33,620
in so many different ways

819
00:51:35,140 --> 00:51:36,340
that it makes for an awkward evening.

820
00:51:36,340 --> 00:51:37,140
But you know what they do?

821
00:51:37,700 --> 00:51:38,820
They hit it head on.

822
00:51:39,540 --> 00:51:42,100
And they don't try to keep anything secret.

823
00:51:42,100 --> 00:51:43,380
They don't play a lot of games.

824
00:51:44,100 --> 00:51:45,140
They just go for it.

825
00:51:46,100 --> 00:51:47,540
And I think that that's the only way

826
00:51:47,540 --> 00:51:49,220
you're gonna handle the situation,

827
00:51:49,220 --> 00:51:51,140
to just be really super direct about it.

828
00:51:51,140 --> 00:51:54,260
I mean, you don't have feelings for those other guys.

829
00:51:54,260 --> 00:51:55,380
If they get their feelings hurt,

830
00:51:55,380 --> 00:51:59,860
that's their own fault for getting the wrong message.

831
00:52:01,860 --> 00:52:02,820
Can you tell us more?

832
00:52:02,820 --> 00:52:05,060
Can you give us more Dawson's Creek recaps?

833
00:52:05,620 --> 00:52:08,260
Because between that and the Sad Lead,

834
00:52:08,260 --> 00:52:10,820
this is, I would say, our most compelling episode yet.

835
00:52:13,220 --> 00:52:15,300
It was just a metaphor.

836
00:52:15,300 --> 00:52:17,460
I mean, something I was using to illustrate a point.

837
00:52:17,460 --> 00:52:17,780
Sure, sure.

838
00:52:17,780 --> 00:52:18,180
That's all.

839
00:52:19,620 --> 00:52:20,820
I mean, she's got just...

840
00:52:21,380 --> 00:52:22,900
I don't think you need to worry about,

841
00:52:22,900 --> 00:52:23,700
am I wrong?

842
00:52:23,700 --> 00:52:25,540
I mean, I get how this sort of...

843
00:52:27,940 --> 00:52:29,540
What's what I'm looking for?

844
00:52:29,540 --> 00:52:32,660
Energy, this sort of relationship could develop.

845
00:52:34,100 --> 00:52:37,860
But, you know, it's not like you owe them anything.

846
00:52:38,340 --> 00:52:40,100
Yeah, I think as long as you're being really careful

847
00:52:40,100 --> 00:52:42,580
not to like lead anybody on and, you know...

848
00:52:44,660 --> 00:52:47,460
As long as these other guys have not gotten the impression

849
00:52:47,460 --> 00:52:49,220
from you that you have feelings for them,

850
00:52:49,940 --> 00:52:51,220
you know, if they have questions on you,

851
00:52:51,220 --> 00:52:52,020
if they have feelings for you,

852
00:52:52,020 --> 00:52:54,660
then that's, you know, that's their issues to deal with.

853
00:52:55,380 --> 00:52:58,900
Hopefully the fact that they are your guys' mutual friends,

854
00:52:58,900 --> 00:53:00,980
they'll be happy for you if you're happy.

855
00:53:00,980 --> 00:53:02,020
That's kind of the thing, right?

856
00:53:02,020 --> 00:53:02,820
Like they're not...

857
00:53:02,820 --> 00:53:05,300
If they're not the sort of people that want to,

858
00:53:07,460 --> 00:53:08,820
you know, be happy for you

859
00:53:08,820 --> 00:53:11,860
when you get into a relationship that makes you happy,

860
00:53:11,860 --> 00:53:12,900
then, and they, you know,

861
00:53:12,900 --> 00:53:14,900
they were only interested in dating you,

862
00:53:14,900 --> 00:53:16,500
then they weren't really your real friends.

863
00:53:16,500 --> 00:53:18,500
But that's not how the human mind works.

864
00:53:19,060 --> 00:53:20,900
It's not how the human heart works either.

865
00:53:20,900 --> 00:53:24,980
But you got to bring some element of logic to these scenarios.

866
00:53:24,980 --> 00:53:26,980
There's what is logical about love, you know,

867
00:53:26,980 --> 00:53:28,580
putting yourself out there and just letting yourself...

868
00:53:28,580 --> 00:53:29,380
Boy, howdy.

869
00:53:29,380 --> 00:53:30,100
Just get hurt.

870
00:53:30,660 --> 00:53:32,420
I think you should just chase your bliss.

871
00:53:33,220 --> 00:53:33,720
Yeah.

872
00:53:34,420 --> 00:53:35,940
Isn't that what I'm saying she should do?

873
00:53:35,940 --> 00:53:39,540
I, well, yeah, but you said it in a hundred words.

874
00:53:39,540 --> 00:53:40,500
I'm saying it in three.

875
00:53:40,500 --> 00:53:42,660
Chase, period, your, period, bliss, period.

876
00:53:43,540 --> 00:53:44,040
Period.

877
00:53:44,420 --> 00:53:45,780
Don't chase your bliss, period, though.

878
00:53:45,780 --> 00:53:46,280
That's...

879
00:53:47,780 --> 00:53:48,980
Chase your miss bliss.

880
00:53:48,980 --> 00:53:49,480
Mm-hmm.

881
00:53:49,480 --> 00:53:50,520
Wait, I said it wrong.

882
00:53:50,520 --> 00:53:51,240
No, you did that.

883
00:53:51,240 --> 00:53:51,740
Find it.

884
00:53:52,360 --> 00:53:52,860
Get it.

885
00:53:52,860 --> 00:53:54,120
It's 20 does.

886
00:53:54,120 --> 00:53:54,620
Get it.

887
00:53:54,620 --> 00:53:55,400
Get your love.

888
00:53:55,400 --> 00:53:57,160
And everything else doesn't matter.

889
00:53:57,720 --> 00:53:58,220
Yeah.

890
00:53:58,220 --> 00:53:59,720
They're gonna, if they're your friends,

891
00:53:59,720 --> 00:54:01,160
they'll be happy for you.

892
00:54:01,160 --> 00:54:01,880
You know what I think?

893
00:54:01,880 --> 00:54:04,520
Honestly, I think, Justin, you're right.

894
00:54:04,520 --> 00:54:05,960
Head on is the best approach,

895
00:54:05,960 --> 00:54:09,240
because if you walk on eggshells and like,

896
00:54:10,040 --> 00:54:14,520
it gives the impression that you're, you know,

897
00:54:14,520 --> 00:54:16,040
that it's a bigger deal than it is.

898
00:54:16,760 --> 00:54:17,400
You know what I mean?

899
00:54:17,400 --> 00:54:18,280
These guys are like,

900
00:54:18,280 --> 00:54:20,600
you know what I mean, these guys that have feelings for you

901
00:54:21,480 --> 00:54:24,840
may read into you trying to be delicate about their feelings.

902
00:54:25,480 --> 00:54:25,980
It's like,

903
00:54:26,680 --> 00:54:28,200
she's trying to let me, you know,

904
00:54:28,200 --> 00:54:31,560
like, as opposed to just being head on and direct

905
00:54:31,560 --> 00:54:33,000
and being clear about it,

906
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:34,440
sending a clear message of like,

907
00:54:34,440 --> 00:54:35,640
hey, we're just friends.

908
00:54:35,640 --> 00:54:37,560
And they may not, you know,

909
00:54:37,560 --> 00:54:39,720
you may be wrong about the feelings for you.

910
00:54:39,720 --> 00:54:41,480
You know, it's hard to separate that

911
00:54:41,480 --> 00:54:43,080
when you've been friends with somebody for a long time.

912
00:54:43,720 --> 00:54:46,440
Maybe it's that it's like a room full of 20 dudes and you,

913
00:54:46,440 --> 00:54:49,560
so it might seem like that's feelings for you

914
00:54:49,560 --> 00:54:50,920
because they're gonna flirt with you.

915
00:54:50,920 --> 00:54:51,720
Yeah.

916
00:54:51,720 --> 00:54:52,680
Yeah, and you know what?

917
00:54:52,680 --> 00:54:58,200
If they haven't pounced already on this relationship,

918
00:54:58,200 --> 00:55:00,520
they're apparently, this torch that they're holding,

919
00:55:00,520 --> 00:55:02,360
they're probably gonna be perfectly content

920
00:55:02,360 --> 00:55:04,200
to continue holding a torch.

921
00:55:04,200 --> 00:55:05,560
In fact, it's even better

922
00:55:05,560 --> 00:55:06,920
because now they don't have to feel guilty

923
00:55:06,920 --> 00:55:07,960
about not pursuing it.

924
00:55:07,960 --> 00:55:11,080
They can just live in sort of this tortured,

925
00:55:11,080 --> 00:55:12,520
sad agony of love.

926
00:55:13,400 --> 00:55:14,520
Yeah, so good job.

927
00:55:14,520 --> 00:55:14,840
Good work.

928
00:55:14,840 --> 00:55:15,560
20 does.

929
00:55:15,560 --> 00:55:15,960
20 does.

930
00:55:15,960 --> 00:55:16,920
20 does, you're getting it.

931
00:55:17,720 --> 00:55:19,800
I'd like to start a segment every week

932
00:55:19,800 --> 00:55:21,800
during this year for the remainder of it

933
00:55:21,800 --> 00:55:25,000
where one of us just talks about how we got it this year.

934
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:28,840
So our sort of self-made motto doesn't seem disingenuous.

935
00:55:29,960 --> 00:55:32,360
Okay, Griffin, how did you get it this year?

936
00:55:32,360 --> 00:55:33,080
Or this week?

937
00:55:33,640 --> 00:55:34,920
Sure, this week, yeah.

938
00:55:34,920 --> 00:55:37,640
This week, I heard a knock at the door

939
00:55:37,640 --> 00:55:39,880
and I went and answered it and it was a stranger

940
00:55:39,880 --> 00:55:41,880
and they were holding a clipboard

941
00:55:41,880 --> 00:55:43,640
with a bunch of magazines on it

942
00:55:43,640 --> 00:55:44,920
and they started talking and I said,

943
00:55:44,920 --> 00:55:45,960
I don't want to waste your time.

944
00:55:45,960 --> 00:55:48,120
I am not going to buy any magazines

945
00:55:48,120 --> 00:55:49,960
and they said thank you and left.

946
00:55:49,960 --> 00:55:51,320
You know what I did this week?

947
00:55:51,320 --> 00:55:53,720
I went to the mall to kill some time

948
00:55:54,360 --> 00:55:58,200
and while I was at the mall, I saw the manicure place

949
00:55:59,240 --> 00:56:02,760
and you guys had told me that getting manicures was good

950
00:56:02,760 --> 00:56:03,960
but this is West Virginia

951
00:56:03,960 --> 00:56:07,000
so there weren't any other men in there ever forever

952
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:08,360
but I went in anyway and said,

953
00:56:08,360 --> 00:56:10,120
hey, I'm ready for a manicure.

954
00:56:10,120 --> 00:56:10,620
Yeah.

955
00:56:11,880 --> 00:56:13,320
My brother said I need to try this

956
00:56:13,320 --> 00:56:15,080
so I'm just going to get it and 20 does.

957
00:56:15,800 --> 00:56:17,080
It was great, relaxing.

958
00:56:17,720 --> 00:56:19,560
How is the conversation is what I want to know.

959
00:56:20,600 --> 00:56:23,480
Oh, sort of screechy and only half English.

960
00:56:24,920 --> 00:56:27,000
Were they like, how's your menopause?

961
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:29,080
Ah, no, ah, damn it.

962
00:56:29,080 --> 00:56:31,080
No, then Justin just brought up Dawson's Creek

963
00:56:31,080 --> 00:56:32,680
and they all had common ground.

964
00:56:37,880 --> 00:56:38,380
Travis.

965
00:56:38,920 --> 00:56:39,960
Oh, how did I get it?

966
00:56:39,960 --> 00:56:42,760
I've been doing my Pilates videos.

967
00:56:43,800 --> 00:56:45,720
I share Netflix queue with Travis.

968
00:56:45,720 --> 00:56:47,240
He is not joking about that.

969
00:56:47,240 --> 00:56:47,640
Damn it.

970
00:56:47,640 --> 00:56:48,520
I'm not.

971
00:56:48,520 --> 00:56:50,120
Oh God, it's real?

972
00:56:50,120 --> 00:56:50,840
Yeah, man.

973
00:56:50,840 --> 00:56:53,800
I want to get healthy and I'm not ashamed of the methods

974
00:56:53,800 --> 00:56:54,520
in which I do it.

975
00:56:54,520 --> 00:56:56,760
I am ashamed of it because I share it

976
00:56:56,760 --> 00:56:58,600
and people see the queue and they're like,

977
00:56:58,600 --> 00:57:03,240
Griffin, did you do Dr. Feelgood's stretchaholics

978
00:57:03,240 --> 00:57:07,000
2012 AbFlex core blasters with a Z?

979
00:57:08,040 --> 00:57:09,320
I don't mean to shut you down, Griffin,

980
00:57:09,320 --> 00:57:10,520
but I do it with my girlfriend

981
00:57:10,520 --> 00:57:12,760
and it's very nice and couple time together

982
00:57:12,760 --> 00:57:14,200
and we're getting healthy together.

983
00:57:14,200 --> 00:57:15,160
We're fucking getting it.

984
00:57:15,720 --> 00:57:18,040
I don't let my girlfriend see me sweat.

985
00:57:18,040 --> 00:57:18,600
That's true.

986
00:57:20,200 --> 00:57:21,640
I mostly just do the yoga.

987
00:57:22,760 --> 00:57:25,800
I share Netflix queue with my in-laws

988
00:57:25,800 --> 00:57:31,400
and my ten-year-old, sorry, 11-year-old sister-in-law.

989
00:57:31,400 --> 00:57:36,840
So my Netflix queue is like one really cool movie

990
00:57:36,840 --> 00:57:39,640
and then Suite Life of Zack and Cody and then-

991
00:57:41,480 --> 00:57:42,440
And Riley's like,

992
00:57:42,440 --> 00:57:44,200
why did you put Suite Life of Zack and Cody

993
00:57:44,200 --> 00:57:45,560
on my instant queue, Justin?

994
00:57:45,560 --> 00:57:48,280
And you're like, I ran out of Dawson's Creek episodes.

995
00:57:48,280 --> 00:57:51,320
Sorry, Suite Life of Zack and Cody on deck.

996
00:57:51,320 --> 00:57:52,040
It's on there.

997
00:57:52,040 --> 00:57:56,520
There is a time where I like to just get on Netflix

998
00:57:56,520 --> 00:57:58,920
and watch the first two minutes of every episode

999
00:57:58,920 --> 00:58:00,360
of Melissa and Joey

1000
00:58:00,360 --> 00:58:02,440
so that when Travis loaded up his instant queue,

1001
00:58:03,480 --> 00:58:05,160
he had a whole treat waiting for him.

1002
00:58:05,160 --> 00:58:06,520
That explains so much.

1003
00:58:06,520 --> 00:58:08,680
Or that Travis's girlfriend would see it and be like,

1004
00:58:08,680 --> 00:58:12,280
oh, you watched all the episodes of Melissa and Joey.

1005
00:58:12,280 --> 00:58:13,080
Oh, in one day.

1006
00:58:13,080 --> 00:58:14,520
I didn't even know that was possible.

1007
00:58:14,520 --> 00:58:15,960
To save on production costs,

1008
00:58:15,960 --> 00:58:18,040
they actually only filmed the first two minutes

1009
00:58:18,040 --> 00:58:19,480
of each episode.

1010
00:58:19,480 --> 00:58:22,200
The rest is 28 minutes of an empty set

1011
00:58:22,200 --> 00:58:24,280
because they figured no one's gonna keep watching.

1012
00:58:24,280 --> 00:58:25,880
While Joey Lawrence sleeps it.

1013
00:58:27,480 --> 00:58:28,600
This is how I earn my paychecks.

1014
00:58:28,600 --> 00:58:29,640
There's no more show.

1015
00:58:30,680 --> 00:58:32,040
Go on, there's no more show.

1016
00:58:32,040 --> 00:58:35,240
Please go, this is where I sleep.

1017
00:58:37,240 --> 00:58:39,560
Whoa, whoa, you're still here.

1018
00:58:40,680 --> 00:58:41,800
We didn't make any more show.

1019
00:58:41,800 --> 00:58:43,240
Please lock up on your way out.

1020
00:58:43,240 --> 00:58:44,120
I'm loamless.

1021
00:58:49,880 --> 00:58:50,520
Oh, fuck.

1022
00:58:51,880 --> 00:58:52,440
That show is off.

1023
00:58:52,440 --> 00:58:53,000
What do we do now?

1024
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:53,800
Just the worst.

1025
00:58:53,800 --> 00:58:54,680
Where do we go from here?

1026
00:58:56,360 --> 00:58:58,600
We could, you know what we should do.

1027
00:58:58,600 --> 00:59:01,960
Tell me, we fucked up pretty bad last week.

1028
00:59:01,960 --> 00:59:02,680
Or last month.

1029
00:59:03,480 --> 00:59:06,440
Are we gonna do like two shitty things in one episode?

1030
00:59:06,440 --> 00:59:09,000
Can we limit it to one shitty thing per show?

1031
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:10,520
It doesn't have to be shitty.

1032
00:59:10,520 --> 00:59:11,320
Listen, Justin.

1033
00:59:12,360 --> 00:59:15,160
Thousands of people died last month.

1034
00:59:16,040 --> 00:59:17,800
Thousands of people died last month.

1035
00:59:17,800 --> 00:59:18,360
Thousands.

1036
00:59:18,360 --> 00:59:24,520
Because they didn't know that it was carnival season.

1037
00:59:24,520 --> 00:59:27,560
All right.

1038
00:59:27,560 --> 00:59:30,920
They did not know it was national radon action month.

1039
00:59:30,920 --> 00:59:32,840
All right, tell me what February is.

1040
00:59:32,840 --> 00:59:34,120
Thousands died.

1041
00:59:34,120 --> 00:59:35,800
Well, Justin, it's a lot of things.

1042
00:59:38,520 --> 00:59:40,520
Is there a funny thing that it is?

1043
00:59:40,520 --> 00:59:42,200
It is jobs in golf month.

1044
00:59:43,640 --> 00:59:45,400
That's what dwarf does, right?

1045
00:59:47,400 --> 00:59:51,880
It is February is fabulous Florida strawberry month.

1046
00:59:51,880 --> 00:59:55,480
So international hoof care month.

1047
00:59:56,440 --> 00:59:59,080
If you want to take care of your pony's feet.

1048
01:00:00,920 --> 01:00:05,480
It's your pull your sofa off the wall month, which what?

1049
01:00:05,480 --> 01:00:06,200

1050

Hold on.

1051
01:00:07,400 --> 01:00:08,360
Say again.

1052
01:00:08,360 --> 01:00:10,840
Pull your sofa off the wall month.

1053
01:00:12,120 --> 01:00:12,360
Why?

1054
01:00:13,640 --> 01:00:15,640
Justin, that's our job.

1055
01:00:16,280 --> 01:00:17,640
My sofa is on the wall.

1056
01:00:17,640 --> 01:00:18,520
I want to keep it there.

1057
01:00:18,520 --> 01:00:19,560
Why am I pulling off?

1058
01:00:20,120 --> 01:00:20,520
Is this a fire hazard?

1059
01:00:20,520 --> 01:00:23,560
It took me hours to super glue that bitch up there.

1060
01:00:23,560 --> 01:00:23,800
Yeah.

1061
01:00:27,480 --> 01:00:28,840
This month incur.

1062
01:00:28,840 --> 01:00:31,880
I'm looking at pull yourself off the wall month and answers.com.

1063
01:00:31,880 --> 01:00:32,200
Thank you.

1064
01:00:32,200 --> 01:00:35,400
Answers.com says February 1st through 28th.

1065
01:00:35,400 --> 01:00:38,520
This month encourages people to experiment with and freshen up

1066
01:00:38,520 --> 01:00:41,240
their home decor through new furniture arrangement.

1067
01:00:41,240 --> 01:00:41,560
Wow.

1068
01:00:42,120 --> 01:00:44,120
So not particularly funny.

1069
01:00:45,160 --> 01:00:47,000
That's not it.

1070
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:47,960
It's sad.

1071
01:00:47,960 --> 01:00:51,400
Like this is the country that we're in that people come up with

1072
01:00:51,400 --> 01:00:52,280
days for this.

1073
01:00:52,920 --> 01:00:57,080
Like, do you realize there are people out there that are starving?

1074
01:00:57,080 --> 01:00:58,760
They don't have enough to eat.

1075
01:00:58,760 --> 01:01:02,280
If you put a bag of dwarf in front of them, they would devour it.

1076
01:01:02,280 --> 01:01:07,320
And and and we're talking about like, I need to reorganize the

1077
01:01:07,320 --> 01:01:09,400
furniture in my home that I have.

1078
01:01:09,960 --> 01:01:11,320
Like, what's wrong with us?

1079
01:01:12,120 --> 01:01:15,240
I'm a soup kitchen and donate your time.

1080
01:01:15,240 --> 01:01:16,760
Just put it in the middle of the room.

1081
01:01:16,760 --> 01:01:19,720
I guess this could be a really good solution for the guy who is

1082
01:01:19,720 --> 01:01:23,000
wondering what to do while the people install the security system.

1083
01:01:23,800 --> 01:01:26,840
Just repeatedly push the sofa against the wall and then move it

1084
01:01:26,840 --> 01:01:29,720
back and then push it back and then just like shake your head and

1085
01:01:29,720 --> 01:01:30,760
rub your chin.

1086
01:01:30,760 --> 01:01:32,040
I just keep doing it.

1087
01:01:33,080 --> 01:01:39,560
Let's for me, if for me, pull the sofa off the wall month is have

1088
01:01:39,560 --> 01:01:43,000
a wall coated in recent chocolate chew wrappers and dirt.

1089
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:46,440
That's all that's back there.

1090
01:01:47,160 --> 01:01:49,640
It's called sticky rectangle of floor month.

1091
01:01:50,200 --> 01:01:50,440
Yeah.

1092
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:53,960
God, you know what?

1093
01:01:53,960 --> 01:01:56,440
I think we should have stuck with jobs in golf month because there's

1094
01:01:56,440 --> 01:02:06,120
a lot of golfer golf pro golf pro club maker, grass tender, whole

1095
01:02:06,120 --> 01:02:12,760
digger check Chevy Chase Chevy Chase in that movie about Chevy

1096
01:02:12,760 --> 01:02:16,760
Chaser Chevy Chaser bald eye bald eye.

1097
01:02:16,760 --> 01:02:19,720
Hey, man, did you go out with Deborah the other day?

1098
01:02:19,720 --> 01:02:22,120
Yeah, dude turned out she was a real Chevy Chaser.

1099
01:02:23,320 --> 01:02:24,520
Also, I am Chevy Chase.

1100
01:02:27,400 --> 01:02:32,120
I say is she a Chevy Chaser, but she ain't messing with men who

1101
01:02:32,120 --> 01:02:33,320
are not named Chevy.

1102
01:02:33,320 --> 01:02:34,840
She messing with Dan Aykroyd.

1103
01:02:36,280 --> 01:02:37,240
No, Dan Aykroyd.

1104
01:02:37,240 --> 01:02:40,760
Aykroyd, fuck, man.

1105
01:02:40,760 --> 01:02:43,080
There aren't that many jobs in golf February.

1106
01:02:44,040 --> 01:02:48,520
Now there's pretty much just golf golfer guy who helps out golfer

1107
01:02:48,520 --> 01:02:49,080
assistant.

1108
01:02:49,080 --> 01:02:49,960
What are they the club?

1109
01:02:49,960 --> 01:02:51,160
The club is club.

1110
01:02:51,160 --> 01:02:51,640
Yes.

1111
01:02:51,640 --> 01:02:56,040
Clubber club barista club barista club arena.

1112
01:02:56,040 --> 01:02:56,600
Yeah.

1113
01:02:56,600 --> 01:02:58,360
Golf course designer.

1114
01:02:58,360 --> 01:03:01,480
What about rich people who live on golf courses to make that golf

1115
01:03:01,480 --> 01:03:02,440
course seem nicer?

1116
01:03:03,240 --> 01:03:03,960
That's good.

1117
01:03:03,960 --> 01:03:04,680
That's a good one.

1118
01:03:04,680 --> 01:03:08,920
Yeah, and then they need window fixers because of all the golf balls.

1119
01:03:08,920 --> 01:03:09,960
Because of all the golf balls.

1120
01:03:09,960 --> 01:03:11,000
That's correct, Justin.

1121
01:03:14,280 --> 01:03:16,920
What about what Brian Brian Doyle Murphy does?

1122
01:03:17,560 --> 01:03:18,200
Murray?

1123
01:03:18,200 --> 01:03:19,240
Who's that guy?

1124
01:03:19,240 --> 01:03:20,920
I was going to get a good riff.

1125
01:03:24,120 --> 01:03:28,520
I was going to say golf ball maker, but of course everyone knows that

1126
01:03:28,520 --> 01:03:29,400
they use eggs.

1127
01:03:31,000 --> 01:03:31,720
Turtle eggs.

1128
01:03:31,720 --> 01:03:32,760
Turtle eggs because they're so bouncy.

1129
01:03:32,760 --> 01:03:34,520
That would be turtles.

1130
01:03:34,520 --> 01:03:36,680
What about mini golf attendees?

1131
01:03:36,680 --> 01:03:38,280
The people who have to like chase off.

1132
01:03:38,280 --> 01:03:39,160
Windmill winder.

1133
01:03:39,160 --> 01:03:41,880
When teens are like fucking on the mini golf course, somebody has to

1134
01:03:41,880 --> 01:03:44,360
chase them off and that's a job that we can get paid for.

1135
01:03:44,360 --> 01:03:46,920
Get out of that clown's mouth, you fucking teens.

1136
01:03:46,920 --> 01:03:47,320
Yeah.

1137
01:03:47,320 --> 01:03:49,000
Dirty, dirty, dirty teens.

1138
01:03:49,560 --> 01:03:50,120
Oh shit.

1139
01:03:50,680 --> 01:03:51,640
Jesus, it's dwarf.

1140
01:03:53,800 --> 01:03:55,000
You kids get out of here.

1141
01:03:55,000 --> 01:03:56,520
Oh Travis.

1142
01:03:56,520 --> 01:03:57,960
I'm an invisible baby.

1143
01:03:57,960 --> 01:04:04,280
I'm an invisible baby from Brooklyn.

1144
01:04:12,760 --> 01:04:16,280
I'm going to call the baby police to have them come get you out.

1145
01:04:18,680 --> 01:04:21,080
Baby firemen in the tiny ladders.

1146
01:04:21,080 --> 01:04:23,880
And now I sound like a baby hairdresser.

1147
01:04:24,680 --> 01:04:27,880
This is baby mini golf, so you can't even see it.

1148
01:04:27,880 --> 01:04:31,480
It's microscopic and it's imaginary.

1149
01:04:31,480 --> 01:04:39,320
It's the walk of the dwarfs mini, mini imaginary baby golf.

1150
01:04:39,320 --> 01:04:42,120
I owe it all to my dad, Griffin.

1151
01:04:44,120 --> 01:04:44,920
So weird.

1152
01:04:45,720 --> 01:04:47,800
Now where can I ask for a baby?

1153
01:04:47,800 --> 01:04:52,760
It's so weird, now where can I ask this cigar humorously?

1154
01:04:54,360 --> 01:04:59,560
Where would be a funny disrespectful place for me to ask my mini imaginary cigar?

1155
01:04:59,560 --> 01:05:00,280
I'm dwarf.

1156
01:05:01,240 --> 01:05:04,760
Next time on invisible baby wall in the family.

1157
01:05:13,240 --> 01:05:14,520
My child is Edith Bunker.

1158
01:05:16,200 --> 01:05:17,480
I meant to mention earlier.

1159
01:05:17,480 --> 01:05:19,160
I meant to mention the ghost child that's Edith Bunker.

1160
01:05:19,160 --> 01:05:24,600
So this has been my brother and my brother's main advice show for the modern era.

1161
01:05:24,600 --> 01:05:26,120
Thank you so much for listening.

1162
01:05:26,120 --> 01:05:26,680
Get again.

1163
01:05:28,040 --> 01:05:29,880
We promise next week might make more sense.

1164
01:05:32,440 --> 01:05:33,240
What's going on?

1165
01:05:33,240 --> 01:05:37,560
mbnbam.com is our website, at mbnbam on Twitter.

1166
01:05:37,560 --> 01:05:42,120
You can follow us there for all the latest scoops and poops.

1167
01:05:42,120 --> 01:05:46,920
And we haven't mentioned in a while, but maximumfun.org, we got forums over there.

1168
01:05:46,920 --> 01:05:52,680
That so every episode that goes up, there's a forum topic and you can chat about the show.

1169
01:05:52,680 --> 01:05:56,360
Yeah, talk about all the shit that just didn't make sense this week.

1170
01:05:56,360 --> 01:05:58,280
Yeah, did you guys notice that this week?

1171
01:05:58,280 --> 01:05:59,240
It did not make sense.

1172
01:06:00,040 --> 01:06:00,680
Thank you so much.

1173
01:06:00,680 --> 01:06:02,600
People who are tweeting about the show.

1174
01:06:03,160 --> 01:06:11,080
The lovely Heather Macaulay, Matt McC1, funny Sorenson, the shirms.

1175
01:06:11,640 --> 01:06:15,320
Our boy, Mitchie D, black nerd, quiet alien.

1176
01:06:15,320 --> 01:06:18,680
Jay Wiltshire, on the wren, everybody.

1177
01:06:18,680 --> 01:06:20,040
I really, I really appreciate it.

1178
01:06:20,840 --> 01:06:22,760
Banker, C Kilgore.

1179
01:06:24,040 --> 01:06:24,680
Thank you, everybody.

1180
01:06:24,680 --> 01:06:28,040
I want to thank John Roderick in the long winters for the use of our theme song.

1181
01:06:28,040 --> 01:06:30,200
It's a departure off the album, putting the days to bed.

1182
01:06:31,720 --> 01:06:35,720
I recommend that everybody buy it every week.

1183
01:06:35,720 --> 01:06:37,000
And this week is no different.

1184
01:06:37,000 --> 01:06:37,800
We could do that thing.

1185
01:06:39,080 --> 01:06:40,680
I also want to thank everybody.

1186
01:06:41,720 --> 01:06:44,040
Cincinnati Shakespeare Company won the lights.

1187
01:06:44,040 --> 01:06:49,320
So thank you, everybody, who went and voted for our lighting video in the Ledco challenge.

1188
01:06:50,120 --> 01:06:52,520
You have helped us win $20,000 in light.

1189
01:06:52,520 --> 01:06:53,720
So thank you so much.

1190
01:06:53,720 --> 01:06:54,200
Wow.

1191
01:06:54,200 --> 01:06:57,480
I hope they have they realize that you're the orchestrator of that.

1192
01:06:58,360 --> 01:06:59,240
I hope so, too.

1193
01:06:59,240 --> 01:06:59,960
I think they do.

1194
01:06:59,960 --> 01:07:01,720
I think my stock has gone way up.

1195
01:07:01,720 --> 01:07:03,960
I'm basically I am Shakespeare.

1196
01:07:07,960 --> 01:07:11,800
If you have some free time this week when you're not listening to all the great maximum

1197
01:07:11,800 --> 01:07:15,000
fun podcasts, get In Case of an Emergency.

1198
01:07:15,000 --> 01:07:20,680
It's Travis's other show where he talks about disaster scenarios and how to best survive them.

1199
01:07:21,560 --> 01:07:25,560
And when you're not doing that, you should check out The Satellite Dish with Justin and Sidney.

1200
01:07:26,280 --> 01:07:29,560
They talk about, you know, TV and all the zaniness therein.

1201
01:07:30,360 --> 01:07:32,280
This past episode, they talk about hoarders.

1202
01:07:32,840 --> 01:07:34,040
It was dope.

1203
01:07:34,040 --> 01:07:35,240
Good work, guys.

1204
01:07:35,240 --> 01:07:35,720
Thanks.

1205
01:07:35,720 --> 01:07:36,680
Thanks, Trav.

1206
01:07:36,680 --> 01:07:38,680
And then you should check out Griffin's podcast.

1207
01:07:38,680 --> 01:07:40,040
Griffin, what's it called again?

1208
01:07:40,040 --> 01:07:41,000
It's called Bathroom.

1209
01:07:41,000 --> 01:07:42,440
It's called Bathroom Reviews.

1210
01:07:45,480 --> 01:07:46,440
I go around town.

1211
01:07:46,440 --> 01:07:52,040
I go around town to different public bathrooms, and then I I highlight the best ones and then

1212
01:07:52,040 --> 01:07:53,480
I low light the worst one.

1213
01:07:54,760 --> 01:07:56,840
That's just some terminology I use on the show.

1214
01:07:56,840 --> 01:07:58,600
It's Bathroom Reviews on iTunes.

1215
01:07:58,600 --> 01:07:59,560
Get it on your iPod.

1216
01:08:01,320 --> 01:08:05,800
Griffin, can you give us one more, you know, question?

1217
01:08:05,800 --> 01:08:06,040
Sure.

1218
01:08:06,040 --> 01:08:07,400
This one we could think about.

1219
01:08:07,400 --> 01:08:07,800
Yeah.

1220
01:08:07,800 --> 01:08:08,440
True on this one.

1221
01:08:08,440 --> 01:08:09,960
It's sent in by Joseph Schmeisser.

1222
01:08:09,960 --> 01:08:11,560
Schmeisser.

1223
01:08:11,560 --> 01:08:12,760
Thank you, Joseph.

1224
01:08:12,760 --> 01:08:16,280
It's by Yahoo Answers user Tyrone, whose profile picture is a bear.

1225
01:08:16,280 --> 01:08:18,200
He asks, when were dogs invented?

1226
01:08:22,680 --> 01:08:23,720
I'm Dorp.

1227
01:08:23,720 --> 01:08:24,440
I'm Dorp.

1228
01:08:24,440 --> 01:08:25,800
I am Dan Moreno.

1229
01:08:27,400 --> 01:08:30,600
To my brother, my brother, it means kiss your dad.

1230
01:08:30,600 --> 01:08:32,120
Square on the lips.

1231
01:08:32,120 --> 01:08:32,520
Teens.

1232
01:08:37,080 --> 01:08:37,880
Keep your heart.

1233
01:08:37,880 --> 01:08:38,760
Three stacks.

1234
01:08:38,760 --> 01:08:39,800
Keep your heart.

1235
01:08:39,800 --> 01:08:41,080
Hey, keep your heart.

1236
01:08:41,080 --> 01:08:41,960
Three stacks.

1237
01:08:41,960 --> 01:08:43,000
Keep your heart.

1238
01:08:43,000 --> 01:08:44,280
Man, these girls are smart.

1239
01:08:44,280 --> 01:08:44,920
Three stacks.

1240
01:08:44,920 --> 01:08:46,600
These girls are smart.

1241
01:08:46,600 --> 01:08:47,480
Play your part.

1242
01:08:53,160 --> 01:08:55,400
I'm Jesse Thorne, America's radio sweetheart.

1243
01:08:55,400 --> 01:08:57,720
And I'm Jordan Morris, boy detective.

1244
01:08:57,720 --> 01:09:01,960
You know me mostly as a stentorian public radio host.

1245
01:09:01,960 --> 01:09:05,240
And you probably know me as a cable TV cutout.

1246
01:09:05,240 --> 01:09:10,440
Every week on our show, Jordan, Jesse, Go, I would say that we share a little slice of

1247
01:09:10,440 --> 01:09:11,240
our hearts.

1248
01:09:11,240 --> 01:09:12,920
Yeah, and dick jokes.

1249
01:09:12,920 --> 01:09:15,320
We are both complex and aimless.

1250
01:09:15,320 --> 01:09:19,480
Leaving you with a empty, dirty feeling after the podcast is over.

1251
01:09:19,480 --> 01:09:21,080
And a chalky taste in your mouth.

1252
01:09:22,040 --> 01:09:23,880
But if you start to taste pennies, that's not us.

1253
01:09:23,880 --> 01:09:25,160
That's a heart attack.

1254
01:09:25,160 --> 01:09:27,560
And remember, a stroke is a brain attack.

1255
01:09:27,560 --> 01:09:28,040
Yeah.

1256
01:09:28,040 --> 01:09:33,880
We talk about, like, important stuff that's going on in our lives, like babies and dogs

1257
01:09:33,880 --> 01:09:34,840
and traveling.

1258
01:09:34,840 --> 01:09:38,920
With some very impressive guests from the worlds of art and entertainment.

1259
01:09:38,920 --> 01:09:42,120
Yeah, Sarah Val, Rob Corddry, Kurt Anderson.

1260
01:09:42,120 --> 01:09:47,080
They've all had to sit through many, many dick jokes made by us.

1261
01:09:47,080 --> 01:09:49,160
It's all online at maximumfun.org.
