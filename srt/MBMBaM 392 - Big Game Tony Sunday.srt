1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:30,640
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:48,160
Hello everybody, and welcome to my brother, my brother, me, and advice show for the modern era.

6
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:59,440
I'm your oldest brother, Justin Pigskin McElroy. I'm Travis Touchdown McElroy,

7
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:05,280
and I'm Griffin McElroy. I'm a hologram this time. Couldn't get the real me. Couldn't get the

8
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:12,480
meet me. This time, it's the hologram one, for this time, the episode. We all loved the big game

9
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:19,680
last night, and a lot of fun was had by all, and congratulations. Or none was. It's possible no fun

10
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:25,120
was had. Or maybe it all ended in a tie, and everybody just went home. Yeah, and they fell

11
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:30,160
in love. All the New England's fans fell in love with all the Philadelphia's fans. Anything's

12
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:33,120
possible in football, and that's what's so exciting and dynamic about this sport. That's

13
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:38,960
why Vince is getting in on the action. We wanted to say in our second consecutive football intro,

14
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:45,680
to both the teams, you'll get them next year. Yeah. Or you got them this year. Or you got it.

15
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:49,520
You did get them this year. Maybe they both got them. Maybe they both win. Maybe they do the thing,

16
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:53,440
and then the Eagles win, and they're like, you know what guys? We had so much fun,

17
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:58,160
and we still have lots of fun Doritos commercials that we didn't even have time to do,

18
00:01:58,720 --> 00:02:05,680
because they won the game in three periods. Do you guys want to play again? What do they do

19
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:10,400
if they finish the game early? Has that ever happened? All the time. All the time. And they're

20
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:15,280
just like, what do we do with this leftover? Because we already got the top score, and we

21
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:20,560
can't play anymore. As we all know, if your team gets to 69 points, you instantly win,

22
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:27,360
whether or not you're ahead. And if you go over, you lose. Well, no, but you just don't win. So

23
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:32,640
like you may want to overshoot it, right? Oh, shoot. Why did we go for two? We had 68 points,

24
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:36,480
and now we have 70. Well, that means we don't get the instant win. And somebody else comes in and

25
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:43,360
gets 69. Nice. They win. But it's only been one period, and it's like, wow, our defense fucking

26
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:48,160
sucks. Oh, shit. Somebody caught the snitch already. Somebody caught the 69 snitch. That's

27
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:53,440
the thing that you don't talk about in Quidditch, by the way. If somebody catches the snitch in the

28
00:02:53,440 --> 00:03:00,000
first five minutes, and you fucking paid like 800 Krugles or whatever for your box seats,

29
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:05,120
and you're like, oh, it's been three minutes, and the game's done? Do I get my Krugles back? No?

30
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:12,160
I just want to step in here. It would be Bitcoin. That is what wizards and warlocks use. And that's

31
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:17,280
why I can't find a motherfucking graphics card for my computer, just because Hagrid's buying them all

32
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:23,840
up reselling them on eBay for a thousand bucks piece of shit. So big predictions for the game

33
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:33,920
this year. I have a lot of money down on like 30 bucks on one that is probably not going to happen.

34
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:41,360
But if it does, it has like a 100 times buyout. So that would be like 300 bucks is the rapture

35
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:47,760
happens in the middle of the game. And everyone just, well, not everyone, but most people, well,

36
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:52,560
not most people. Just Tom Brady. I mean, let's say it, just Tom Brady. Do you think Jesus is

37
00:03:52,560 --> 00:04:00,000
going to let Tom Brady in after all the deflate gate? I don't think so. Jesus loves hard, full

38
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:08,400
balls, not these soft ones that Tom likes to play with. My prediction is that if, I have to figure

39
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:15,840
out the right tense here, if they will have won, if the Patriots will have won in the past, right?

40
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:18,800
Yeah. Then during the post-game interview,

41
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:22,320
they're going to say to Tom Brady, like, what are you going to do now? And he's going to say,

42
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:25,920
I'm going to go fuck that beauty rest mattress I've had my eye on.

43
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:29,680
Yeah. Yeah. He loves to do that. Puts his wiener between.

44
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:33,600
You all seen that commercial, right? Where he's definitely going to have sex with that mattress

45
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:36,400
and the dude's like, will there be anything else? And he's like, no,

46
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:40,160
I'm just going to go fuck that mattress. And he fucks a mattress, huh?

47
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:45,520
Yeah. Well, in the extended version, they edit it for TV, but you can find it on YouTube

48
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:50,560
where there's a solid 10-minute rest of the commercial where he just-

49
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:52,640
Oh, he fucks that. You know what? I'll say it. Makes love.

50
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:56,080
You said YouTube likes that. YouTube loves it.

51
00:04:56,080 --> 00:05:00,320
YouTube wants that content on their channel. YouTube loves it. You can see Tom Brady make

52
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:02,880
love to a mattress on YouTube. All right.

53
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:06,880
And search for those words exactly. Yeah, explicitly.

54
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:12,160
One of the things that I'm going to love, I did love, was the Prince hologram.

55
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:17,440
Now, what's fun about the Prince hologram is everybody, I think people started joking about it

56
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:21,440
at some point and then everybody started saying like, yeah, actually, now that I think about it,

57
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:24,160
the way things are going, there will probably be a Prince hologram.

58
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:30,240
Yeah. So Justin Timberlake and Sheila E. got on the phone.

59
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:36,640
Sheila E. takes the Twitter and is like, don't even trip. JT assures me there's no hologram.

60
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:42,720
But if I was going to drop a hologram, that's exactly the environment I want to drop it into.

61
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:46,720
Because when you're not expecting a hologram, that's when you're going to love it the most.

62
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:51,280
And you know Sheila E. can't keep a secret. Telephone, telegraph, tell a Sheila E.

63
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:57,040
I want, if it will have happened, that the hologram pops up and everybody's kind of like,

64
00:05:57,040 --> 00:06:03,200
uh, and then like JT tries to like throw it off to Prince and Prince just like shakes his head.

65
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:10,560
Yeah, I would love a hologram of Prince who was explicitly against ever being a hologram

66
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:21,040
ever was just like, actually, no, dude, you can't just sort of fucking conjure me there, JT.

67
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:25,040
I mean, it's fucked that you get to do the Super Bowl again anyway.

68
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:31,040
And Janet is banned for life. We all kind of remember that. This is mine now.

69
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:35,680
No, JT, I think maybe calm down for just a minute because it's not,

70
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:41,200
you don't get to have Prince's sort of essence. Do you know what I mean, dude?

71
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:44,800
Like, here's the one, here's the one way I'm okay with them doing a Prince hologram.

72
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:49,360
Oh, be careful. Look at the ice below you, bud. You can see the water right through.

73
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:53,840
It's wild. While JT is performing, they just cut to the stands.

74
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:57,280
And Prince is just like sitting in a seat, like eating some popcorn,

75
00:06:57,280 --> 00:07:00,560
cut back to Justin Timberlake, right? And then people are just like, wait,

76
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:06,480
was that a Prince hologram? Hold on. And then at the end of it, Justin Timberlake is

77
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:09,760
banned from the Super Bowl for life. Well, congratulations to everybody.

78
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:14,640
I guess is what we're trying to get at. It kind of feels like we all won.

79
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:18,720
And those commercials don't get me started on the ad. You know what?

80
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:25,920
I only watch the big game, which we have to call it. I only watch the big game for the ads.

81
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:31,680
Tony, can you go back and edit out every time he said Super Bowl and put in big game, Tony?

82
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:34,560
No, don't put in big game, Tony. Why are you laughing?

83
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:38,800
Don't put in big game, Tony. We don't call the Super Bowl big game, Tony.

84
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:42,720
I mean, we can if you want. You've been trying to get big game,

85
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:47,040
Tony going for a long time and we told you it's not happening.

86
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:51,760
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to big game, Tony 52.

87
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:58,320
I'm very excited. It's big game, Tony Sunday.

88
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:05,360
Are you ready for some Tony? Hey, folks, all our big screen TVs are on sale

89
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:10,640
to celebrate big screen, Tony Sunday. Come on down for this big screen, Tony sale.

90
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:13,440
Holy shit. Big game, Tony Sunday.

91
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:16,720
Hey, let's actually help people for a change.

92
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:21,200
I think we just help people with some good jokes about the big game, Tony.

93
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:25,600
Hi, brothers. I work as a waiter at a Thai restaurant from 530 to 11.

94
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:29,760
Seems unnecessary, but thank you for the specificity.

95
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:31,120
Well, you'll find out why.

96
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:36,160
One of the highlights of working here is there's a family style meal the staff gets for dinner,

97
00:08:36,160 --> 00:08:38,880
which the chefs put extra special love and care into.

98
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:42,960
However, if it's a slow night, my boss will sometimes tell me I can go home early.

99
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:44,720
That sounds nice.

100
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:47,680
What this means is that I don't get dinner from the kitchen

101
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:49,760
because the chefs and waiters usually eat around 10.

102
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:55,200
Sometimes I can literally smell the curry cookie when my boss tells me to go home

103
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:57,280
and I have to live with the fact that I don't get to eat it

104
00:08:57,280 --> 00:09:00,160
and instead have to survive on cereal or leftover pasta.

105
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:02,960
When my boss tells me to go home, is it acceptable for me to say,

106
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:06,800
no, Ashley, I'd like to stay for dinner. Thank you very much.

107
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:09,680
Or is that absolutely crazy?

108
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:12,480
That's from Tongue Tied in New Jersey.

109
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:17,360
This is, well, see, here's, okay.

110
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:21,280
The reason you get sent home is because there's not enough business

111
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:23,600
to justify paying for you to be there.

112
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:28,960
What is the window of time that you would have to be within 10 o'clock

113
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:31,440
that it would not be weird if you said,

114
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:37,200
okay, I'm off the clock, but I'm going to stick around until dinner time, right?

115
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:40,640
Is that 15 minutes, 30 minutes, two hours?

116
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:43,440
Two hours, it's not two hours.

117
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:47,200
I think if it's about to pop off, I think you're fine to be like,

118
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:49,440
can I, you mind if I kick it and just eat?

119
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:52,720
Because I would love to just grub here if that's fine by you.

120
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:55,040
The boss is like, grub away, grub away.

121
00:09:55,040 --> 00:10:04,560
This one's challenging for me because my two favorite things in Earth is eaten and not working.

122
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:08,800
And so it sounds like these two things are so diametrically opposed.

123
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:11,520
If you tell me I'm going to send you home an hour early,

124
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:16,160
I think that's another hour of Monster Hunter I can play before my body has to go to sleep.

125
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:17,520
And that's very good to me.

126
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:21,200
It's almost as good as eating this good free food it sounds like,

127
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:23,920
which is also something I'm extremely into.

128
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:27,520
So in my mind, you're looking at a win-win.

129
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:29,280
This is a great job because it's a win-win.

130
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:30,160
Every night you work.

131
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:35,600
Either you get to go home early and spend an hour or two doing shit you'd rather do than work,

132
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:37,760
or you work the whole time.

133
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:41,920
But then you get to eat some yum stuff.

134
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:44,320
And that's very good too.

135
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:48,400
I think you need to celebrate sort of either way this thing breaks.

136
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:49,120
But that's what I'm saying.

137
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:52,640
I think 20 minutes, half hour of like, okay, cool.

138
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:53,520
I'm off the clock.

139
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:59,600
I mean, because you could ostensibly like just shoot the shit with the boss until dinner is,

140
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:02,240
you know, and then be like, oh, well, as long as I'm here, right?

141
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:05,120
Oh, stall them in a conversation.

142
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:06,400
That's very good, Travis.

143
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:08,880
Where it's like, you don't explicitly ask to be sent home.

144
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:14,400
You just enjoy their company so much that eventually it'd be like rude for you to leave then.

145
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:15,360
The dinner's coming out.

146
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:16,560
It's time for me to just kick it.

147
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:20,480
Can we talk for a second about getting sent home early from work?

148
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:24,800
Because there's really nothing better than that.

149
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:25,520
And it's fun.

150
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:29,760
And the fun thing about that is you don't get paid when you get sent home from work.

151
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:35,120
And you ostensibly got a job because you did want to get paid for time rendered.

152
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:40,320
But that value proposition, something about getting sent home an hour early,

153
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:43,040
that value proposition just goes straight out the window.

154
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:49,200
Like, if you could just stream together weeks of getting sent home early,

155
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:52,720
I mean, again, financially, you're going to be in ruin.

156
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:53,120
Yeah.

157
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:55,760
It just, nothing goes down sweeter than that.

158
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:59,120
And you absolutely lose that when you work for yourself.

159
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:04,000
Or like when you, because like I remember even before like working from home,

160
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:08,320
when I worked at the theater, I wasn't hourly.

161
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:09,440
I was salary.

162
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:15,840
And so like leaving early was a decision I made and always made me feel guilty and bad.

163
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:19,440
But having a boss type person who looks at me and goes,

164
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:21,360
this decision isn't up to you.

165
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:24,240
I'm telling you to go home and take a nap.

166
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:26,080
It's like, okay.

167
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:27,360
I like it the opposite.

168
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:29,120
I added him a bim bam.

169
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:38,080
And then I'm like, time to yank the old pterodactyl whistle and clock out.

170
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:39,040
Jesus.

171
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:40,080
Okay, okay.

172
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:48,480
So like, for instance, you should have gotten to the end of that sentence quicker Griffin.

173
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:51,120
My, oh, oh, my back hitting that podcast.

174
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:52,480
It's a flaring up.

175
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:54,640
Guess the rainstorms coming in.

176
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:56,160
Better punch out.

177
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:58,480
Play some Monster Hunter for nine hours.

178
00:12:58,480 --> 00:12:59,280
Oh, my back.

179
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:01,040
You've earned it.

180
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:02,240
I think I earned it.

181
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:04,640
Stay at the podcast minds.

182
00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:07,200
Or just, you can probably just take the food, right?

183
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:08,960
Like nobody's going to yell at you.

184
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:10,400
Well, not if it's not ready.

185
00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:13,520
I mean, it's curry.

186
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:17,760
You could probably just throw it on a pot at home and get it to where it needs to be.

187
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:18,480
Oh, that's good.

188
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:20,240
Okay, Griffin has a great point.

189
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:24,000
What you do is you go in the kitchen with a Tupperware and you just start scooping things

190
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,200
out of pots as they're cooking.

191
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:26,320
Like, don't worry, bros.

192
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:27,600
I'll finish this one at home.

193
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:30,640
Yeah, I mean, curry is a lot of principle work, right?

194
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:37,200
It's a lot of chopping and screwing and boiling and then simmering and then simmering and then

195
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:40,160
really like 90% of it's just mostly simmering.

196
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:41,680
You can do that at home.

197
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:44,000
You just throw it on the pot and then-

198
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:49,280
Yeah, that's a real good way to cut out the love and care too that the chefs usually provide

199
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:52,400
if you consistently say, well, I could just do this myself.

200
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:55,920
I feel like the love and the care is in the mise en place.

201
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:59,200
Like after that, it's just heat and time.

202
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:00,000
Like you could do that.

203
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,760
Yeah, stove top don't care.

204
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:02,720
Stove top don't love.

205
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:04,400
It's all right, guys.

206
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:06,000
I'll nuke it at home.

207
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,880
How long do you think I need to nuke this to finish up your work?

208
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:10,160
I'm not saying curry is easy to cook.

209
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:11,200
It's extremely difficult.

210
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:15,760
But what me and Justin are saying is like most of that stuff comes in the beginning of it

211
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:18,880
when you sort of build the house that the curry is going to live in.

212
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:21,600
And then you sort of let that house settle on the stove top.

213
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:25,440
And I think it comes right at the end when the person lifts the lid at the very end to

214
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:28,320
check it, kisses the surface of the curry.

215
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:28,800
Yes.

216
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:31,680
And that's where the love gets infused into it.

217
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:36,880
And you know really like a master curry chef by how blistered and horribly scarred their

218
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:40,000
lips are from kissing this extremely hot stuff.

219
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:44,000
And can they get the lipstick print to stay on the surface of the curry?

220
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,280
It's hard, man.

221
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:49,520
Yeah, don't you guys hate when you get takeout curry and you take a bite and you're like,

222
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:50,240
ugh.

223
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:53,280
You can tell they've only kissed it like two or three times.

224
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:56,960
It's like if I had known that when I was there, I would have just asked for extra kisses

225
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:58,320
while I was already there.

226
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:00,720
I could drive back out to get the rest of my kisses.

227
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:04,160
And not only that, Justin, it's also like the peanut butter where you open it up and

228
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:06,720
there's the surface level, right, where the kiss was.

229
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:09,680
And if that's already been scooped out and you're getting down to like the middle of

230
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:13,440
the peanut butter, like did the kiss make it all the way down there?

231
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:14,000
You know what I mean?

232
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:14,640
So that's the problem.

233
00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:18,080
If someone makes a big old pot of curry, like a big old pot, they kiss the top.

234
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:22,080
Even if they kiss it 10 times, is that really making it to the bottom third of the curry?

235
00:15:22,640 --> 00:15:25,840
The thing is you have to kiss your ingredients as you go.

236
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:28,400
That's the only way to make sure that you're really well covered.

237
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:29,920
That's so true.

238
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:31,760
Griffin, how about Yahoo?

239
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:34,560
Blue Apron kisses all their stuff for you, so you don't have to worry about that.

240
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:36,560
It shows up pretty smooched.

241
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:39,440
You do have to kiss your own salt and pepper and olive oil, though.

242
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:39,680
Yes.

243
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:43,200
Sometimes there's a disposable ramekin of kisses in case you want to add more and you

244
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:44,160
can handle it.

245
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:44,480
Yeah.

246
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:46,240
This one was sent in by the delivery man, Seth Carlson.

247
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:46,720
Thank you, Seth.

248
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:48,160
It's Yahoo Answers user.

249
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:57,120
MiniMiniTeckel asks, do doves like being used for magic tricks?

250
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:59,120
Huh.

251
00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:01,600
Ethics.

252
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:02,400
Huh.

253
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:03,360
Ethics, y'all.

254
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:04,720
Been watching a lot of Good Place.

255
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:07,840
Just the ethics, though, of this one is a real challenge.

256
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:08,400
Is this...

257
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:10,960
Okay, how is this not already a cartoon movie?

258
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:11,360
I've got...

259
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:11,760
Hold on.

260
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:14,720
Cartoon movie.

261
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:17,600
Hey, Travis, read me everything on that shitty notepad right now.

262
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:19,120
I want to know everything you got.

263
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:19,600
No, no, no.

264
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:21,280
I'm Googling it first just to make sure.

265
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:26,800
Okay, understand what I think about you and sort of how your brain works that I was

266
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:31,840
100% sure you had a notebook full of half-baked movie.

267
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:32,960
No, I absolutely do.

268
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:35,280
In my phone, I do keep a running note.

269
00:16:35,280 --> 00:16:38,800
The other day, I just wrote down taglines for movies that don't exist, and my favorite

270
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:41,360
one was, she's one hip granny.

271
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:46,400
And it's about a grandmother who gets hip surgery and has a bionic hip that maybe turns

272
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:49,440
into a superhero or some kind of dance champion.

273
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:49,680
Yeah.

274
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:50,000
Don't know.

275
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:50,960
Haven't fleshed it out.

276
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:56,880
I think it would be hard to make a compelling animated feature about a bird that spends

277
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:59,600
multiple hours at a time in a man's armpit.

278
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:00,080
Yeah.

279
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:04,560
That, I don't think that that, like you could get Jason Sudeikis to do the voice if you

280
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:06,560
wanted to, still would not be...

281
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:08,240
The footage, the visual element of the film.

282
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:10,800
Just the visual element of very dark...

283
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:14,000
That's a good twist for the ending though, like a bird, like a dove who's trying to,

284
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:18,640
maybe it's a pigeon, right, who isn't a dove, and the pigeon's trying to break into show

285
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:22,320
business, and everyone's like, we only bring doves in here, and the pigeon's like, I can

286
00:17:22,320 --> 00:17:26,560
do it, right, and the pigeon's training, and then at the end, he's like, oh yeah, you

287
00:17:26,560 --> 00:17:30,000
know what, you made it, come on bird, but then the bird, the end of the movie is just

288
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,560
like him in a sleeve, and he's like, oh this isn't...

289
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:33,040
Oh wait.

290
00:17:33,040 --> 00:17:33,840
Yeah, this sucks.

291
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:34,320
This sucks.

292
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:36,400
All right, let's break it down, pros and cons.

293
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:43,760
Okay, the con, I think that like any performer, the dove probably hates the part where she's

294
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:50,800
in a person's armpit, but then for many hours, that part is probably not a big hit, but I

295
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:55,600
think that the dove probably loves the part where everybody's like, oh shit, a dove.

296
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:56,400
Yeah, people are...

297
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:57,680
Like that's gotta be thrilling.

298
00:17:57,680 --> 00:18:00,560
Think of a time where you are that excited to see a bird.

299
00:18:00,560 --> 00:18:01,360
It's almost...

300
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:01,840
Never.

301
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:02,800
Pretty much never.

302
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:10,000
My like interest in birds is a sliding scale to they're up in the sky, they're in a tree,

303
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:14,320
okay, they're right in front of me on the sidewalk as I'm walking towards them, I'm

304
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:17,440
a little interested, I hope that thing flies away before I get to it, it almost certainly

305
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:21,760
will, I'm not worried about it, to it gets in my house somehow, oh god, oh god, I'm

306
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:27,440
extremely interested in this bird, but not really excited for its presence, to oh shit,

307
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:29,840
where did that thing even come from?

308
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:32,640
Probably the armpit, but that's still kind of an impressive feat.

309
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:39,600
Now to counteract the counter for the armpit thing is magicians are known to train their

310
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:45,280
bodies to get a lot of space in there, I don't know, like Pin, Pin has like, you could get

311
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:48,880
like a gallon and a half of water inside of Pin's armpit.

312
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:51,120
Yeah, it's a deep, deep, deep pit.

313
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:55,360
Chris Angel, before he started doing sort of more transgressive magical acts, he did

314
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:56,880
a lot of sort of dove work.

315
00:18:56,880 --> 00:19:03,440
You, I mean, you could eat an entire bowl of gazpacho, like a full, like full belly's

316
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:07,680
worth of gazpacho out of that dude's pit, if you were nasty.

317
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:12,960
He actually had a lot of his dove pockets removed to make it harder on him to do magic

318
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:15,840
because it was just, he lost sort of the thrill of it.

319
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:20,880
You know, I'm thinking about what that moment must be like for the dove, right?

320
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:26,400
You're in a dark armpit, you know, and you're like, I hate this, and then you come out the

321
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:31,920
sleeve and you're like, you get half a second of like, oh yes, I'm out, and then it's all

322
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:36,640
bright lights and techno music and people clapping really loudly and you're probably

323
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:38,240
like, put me back in that armpit.

324
00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:40,000
This sucks.

325
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,680
It's probably a little bit spooky.

326
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:46,240
I've never been physically present for a show where a dove is magically sent out in the

327
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:49,040
audience after a magician does his incredible trick.

328
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:55,840
I think that would be highly distracting because that has gone from magic trick almost instantly

329
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:59,200
devolves from magic trick into serious scenario.

330
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:04,400
I would be clocking that bird for the rest of the program, just making sure that its

331
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:09,280
movements did not hove into my sort of like, action scene.

332
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:11,600
Because what, somebody in the audience has to get the dove.

333
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:13,200
Like somebody's gonna have to grab the dove.

334
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:18,400
Yeah, well I think the closest we've come, Justin, is when we went to the pirate adventure

335
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:21,760
and they sent out a big old parrot.

336
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:26,480
Big old parrot made a loop and then I get, never showed up again for the rest of the

337
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:31,760
show, which I do have to think like, I wish I could do that as a performer, like be in

338
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:36,160
a play where I just come out pre-show, hi everybody, and then I sit backstage and I

339
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:37,120
eat some fruit.

340
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:38,320
Here's a big wild dog.

341
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:41,440
I'm just gonna let it out into the audience for the rest of the show.

342
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,040
Keep an eye on it.

343
00:20:43,040 --> 00:20:43,840
Don't look at it.

344
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:51,600
How come parrot is okay to be out inside bird, but pretty much most other birds if they're

345
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:55,920
outside in the house, it's like, if I go into a house and there's a parrot just like chilling,

346
00:20:55,920 --> 00:20:59,600
not in any sort of captivity, I'm like, yeah, all right.

347
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:02,640
Any other bird, I'm like, you know, you've got a pigeon in here, right?

348
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:05,440
You know, even a parrot.

349
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:08,880
A really fun goof would be like, invite someone over to your house for the first time, and

350
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:12,160
there's like a parrot on a stand right, and then they're like, oh, a parrot, and you

351
00:21:12,160 --> 00:21:13,360
react like, what?

352
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:15,360
Oh, God, how did that get in here?

353
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:16,960
It's because it can talk, right?

354
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:17,760
That's it?

355
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:20,240
That's because it's big, easy to spot.

356
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:20,720
I think it's size.

357
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:28,160
My concern about animal size can be plotted on a sort of bell curve to, the peak of the

358
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:32,880
bell curve is the likelihood with which I could spin kick the animal.

359
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:40,240
So like, if it's very small, if it's a mouse or pigeon, which is a mouse that flies, that

360
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:43,280
I would have a very hard time spin kicking.

361
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:48,640
If it gets larger than that to like medium range, like a parrot, absolutely, absolutely

362
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:51,920
one flying spin kick, I could take that down.

363
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:58,560
If it gets bigger than that, a very, very, like a bear, right, I could spin kick it all

364
00:21:58,560 --> 00:21:59,520
day long.

365
00:21:59,520 --> 00:21:59,840
Yes.

366
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:01,760
It's not going to have the desired effect.

367
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:09,040
So on the x-axis is ability to spin kick, and on the y-axis is impact of spin kick.

368
00:22:09,040 --> 00:22:13,200
Well, yeah, and there's a z-axis of need to spin kick, because I want to make it clear,

369
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:18,480
I'm assuming Justin's talking about self-defense here, and not that he is some sort of small

370
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:25,120
game, the smallest game hunter who goes around with an insatiable desire to spin kick God's

371
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:25,920
creations.

372
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:28,000
The new sequel, it's a monster hunter.

373
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,160
Yeah, Justin spin kicks a bunch of birds.

374
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:35,920
I need to know, I could defend my family from the animal via spin kick, if need be.

375
00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:41,920
Because there is also a number of like, one parrot v. a hundred pigeons, you know what

376
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:42,240
I mean?

377
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:48,160
Like, we could get into some Tippi Hedren shit of just like, I don't mind a dove.

378
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:50,560
Oh no, a thousand doves.

379
00:22:50,560 --> 00:22:51,680
That's how birds ends.

380
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:57,600
Tippi Hedren does a sick street fighter spin kick, gets like 20 doves at a time in that

381
00:22:57,600 --> 00:22:58,000
kick.

382
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,480
I want to make another point here.

383
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:05,920
I feel like there would be sort of a mounting resentment for a dove used in a magic trick,

384
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:13,600
because there really is not much career advancement you could seek beyond that as a dove, aside

385
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:17,200
from John Woo movie use.

386
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:18,080
Yes, huge.

387
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:23,440
And that is a very small, or like even the job pool for this one, very competitive, is

388
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:25,200
sign of a miracle from God.

389
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:30,720
And that's, that's, that's a, I don't even know where you apply, like you can't get,

390
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:34,720
Zip Recruiter is great, but I don't think you can get on Zip Recruiter, a bird Zip Recruiter

391
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:41,120
and say like, great dove, beautiful wings, beautiful lustrous beak, looking to be used

392
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,640
to show people that it's going to stop raining real soon from God.

393
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:50,240
Uh, Trav, can I check in with you real quick and see how much energy you expended trying

394
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:52,640
to come up with a punny name for a bird related to Zip Recruiter?

395
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:55,360
Oh, a lot Justin, thank you for asking.

396
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:58,240
I was sitting here in silence trying to do it.

397
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:03,040
That's exactly what was going on, thank you for asking.

398
00:24:03,040 --> 00:24:07,440
Yeah, do you have any failed, uh, failed things that you just want to like throw out there?

399
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:12,720
Was, Travis, did, in the last 30 seconds has, has the word bird recruiter crossed your mind

400
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:13,040
sort of reflexively?

401
00:24:13,040 --> 00:24:18,000
No, it was more like tweet recruiter, I was trying to do it like bird sounds,

402
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,000
cheap recruit, you know, like something in there.

403
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:23,840
Um, and I just, and I honestly just wasn't getting there.

404
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:29,680
It just wasn't, I didn't even have any false starts, the engine wasn't even turning over

405
00:24:29,680 --> 00:24:34,080
because I, I was simultaneously trying to come up with a punny name for it and also

406
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:40,480
thinking, man, I hope that there's not like a whole like, magicians are bad to doves kind of thing.

407
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:46,480
Um, let me, let's like, let's lay that on the table and yell at it.

408
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:48,320
It's not a nice thing to do.

409
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:51,760
One of my cool metrics is when I do it to a human child,

410
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:55,840
because I don't think that I would do that to a human child.

411
00:24:55,840 --> 00:24:59,840
I put it in my sleeve and, and then throw it out into an audience.

412
00:25:01,040 --> 00:25:04,880
Yeah, when you put it like that, it's an uncool thing.

413
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:05,280
You're right.

414
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:06,720
It's an, it's inhumane.

415
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:09,200
And I think we can put, put, put this to bed.

416
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:10,960
Doves do not like being used for magic tricks.

417
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:14,160
And so I would like to present to you the magic trick of the future.

418
00:25:14,160 --> 00:25:18,640
You see me, I've got a white cloth and I say, keep an eye on this cloth, folks.

419
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:20,400
You're going to love what happens next.

420
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:24,960
And then I tuck it into my sleeve or whatever magicians do.

421
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:30,400
And then I pull out a drone and then I just kind of fly the drone around the audience for a little

422
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:31,520
bit for like 10 minutes.

423
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:34,240
And that's going to eat up a lot of magic showtime.

424
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:38,640
I actually think that that would, that is far more impressive than a duh.

425
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:39,200
Okay, cool.

426
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:40,640
It's a small drone.

427
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:43,520
I'm not talking about like one of those big ones they use for movies and shit.

428
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:46,000
I'm not talking about one of those Avatar 2 drones.

429
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,720
I'm talking about like a little one, stocking stuffer drone.

430
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:50,240
Here's, okay, here's a movie.

431
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:52,800
All right, here's, here's a cool magic trick.

432
00:25:52,800 --> 00:25:54,560
No, go ahead and say the movie, Trav.

433
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:55,440
Okay.

434
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:57,040
Just chase that instinct, bud.

435
00:25:57,040 --> 00:25:59,040
There's no reason to shy away from it.

436
00:25:59,040 --> 00:25:59,680
Okay.

437
00:25:59,680 --> 00:26:01,440
Here's the magic movie about doves.

438
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:06,560
So the dove, it's all about, it's kind of a John Henry kind of thing where now there's

439
00:26:06,560 --> 00:26:11,600
a mechanical dove being brought in who does his own magic tricks and the dove has to outperform

440
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:12,800
the drone.

441
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:19,840
But also, sorry, the dove, the dove is the magician.

442
00:26:21,040 --> 00:26:25,200
Cause this can be great if, if a magician pulls a dove out and the dove's like, oh

443
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:25,440
yeah.

444
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:30,320
And the dove lifts up its wing and produces like a bee and it's yeah.

445
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:30,560
Yeah.

446
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:34,160
And then the bee pulls out some plankton or something like that.

447
00:26:34,160 --> 00:26:35,360
And it's like, what's up?

448
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:36,080
What's up?

449
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:39,280
And then the plankton lifts up and what's that as a blue whale?

450
00:26:39,280 --> 00:26:40,960
And it just starts all over again.

451
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:45,120
That's what the circle of life is from Lion King.

452
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:46,720
How about another question?

453
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:48,240
Yeah, I'd love that.

454
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:50,000
Don't put doves in your armpits.

455
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:53,840
I accidentally, I'm looking over these questions and realizing the first three are all about

456
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:54,400
food.

457
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:58,880
And then I just remembered I didn't eat breakfast, so they might all be connected.

458
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:00,160
Anyways, next question.

459
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:04,640
While leaving our apartment today, my boyfriend and I found a torn open unmarked cardboard

460
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:09,200
box full of 10 boxes of Tagalong Girl Scout cookies in our lawn.

461
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:13,920
It was rained on, but none of the cookie boxes are damaged.

462
00:27:13,920 --> 00:27:19,040
There is a receipt with the attended address in it, but the address is half a mile away.

463
00:27:19,040 --> 00:27:23,520
The address also belongs to the house that I lived next to last year.

464
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:25,840
And they were terrible neighbors.

465
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:26,320
God.

466
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:28,160
Can we keep these?

467
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:30,800
Are they ours now?

468
00:27:30,800 --> 00:27:34,560
Or will we end up in some horrible cookie hell?

469
00:27:34,560 --> 00:27:39,120
That's from taking tagalongs in Muncie.

470
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:49,200
Now, I don't know if this is going to be important for the show itself, but tagalongs are the

471
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:52,880
ones that are like a cookie with peanut butter on top and then covered in chocolate.

472
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:53,200
Yeah.

473
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:54,480
Oh, shit.

474
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:55,280
I love those.

475
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:56,320
But-

476
00:27:56,880 --> 00:27:57,440
Sure, of course.

477
00:27:57,440 --> 00:28:00,080
Of course, that specific cookie.

478
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:02,640
There's two questions here.

479
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:04,880
One, are you going to eat these cookies?

480
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:06,080
And they didn't even mention this.

481
00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:08,640
Are we going to eat these rained on outside cookies?

482
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:10,400
I don't know how to begin unpacking that.

483
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:11,520
I don't know how to begin answering that.

484
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:12,480
Take them out of the box.

485
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:15,520
No, I know how eating cookies works, Travis.

486
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:16,560
I'm very good at it.

487
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:22,800
The other question is returning them because here's my theory.

488
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:30,080
The girl scout in this family of the neighbors you live to next to last year who were terrible

489
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:35,600
is on that grift grind so hard.

490
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:38,880
Yeah, it just went out, sold the whole freaking box.

491
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:40,960
It was amazing.

492
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:42,320
Sold the whole freaking box.

493
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:43,440
Don't even worry about it.

494
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:48,560
So I'm going to get my points that I need for the trip to Disneyland because of the box.

495
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:50,720
Now, this grift has not been thought through very well because I mean-

496
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:51,200
No, yes.

497
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:56,480
What, like $40 that they, unless they stole, maybe they, you know, stole $40 or they went

498
00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:59,520
up to somebody and said, hey, can I just have $40?

499
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:00,320
And they said, yes.

500
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:01,200
And they said, good.

501
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:05,600
And then they threw the box they were carrying as hard and as far away as they possibly could.

502
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:08,160
I actually did a similar thing when I was a child once.

503
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:09,760
This is another Travis anecdote.

504
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:11,040
Is this banned candy?

505
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:16,560
Yeah, it was banned candy and I ate, I think, all the bars and then like it came time to

506
00:29:16,560 --> 00:29:20,240
turn in the money or the unsold bars and I had to go to mom and dad and be like, hey,

507
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:25,040
I need $30 because I just ate all of those and they did it.

508
00:29:25,040 --> 00:29:26,480
Or I will go to prison.

509
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:27,120
Yeah.

510
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:29,040
Yeah, in other words, candy fraud.

511
00:29:29,040 --> 00:29:36,080
And they did it and they were not, they were not pleased with me for, oh, so many reasons.

512
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:40,560
I think you have to take the cookies to them and drop them on their porch.

513
00:29:40,560 --> 00:29:41,520
It's an angel test.

514
00:29:42,160 --> 00:29:47,280
The problem is, the problem is that you don't know, there's two things you don't know.

515
00:29:47,280 --> 00:29:53,120
One, have the people moved and maybe there's very nice new people there who spent the last

516
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:57,280
$50 they had buying 10 boxes of tagalong cookies.

517
00:29:57,280 --> 00:29:58,080
Are they bad with money?

518
00:29:58,080 --> 00:29:58,640
Of course they are.

519
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:00,560
That's how they got down to just $50 left.

520
00:30:00,560 --> 00:30:04,960
And bad with cookies, it sounds like, because they just left them laying on their lawn somewhere.

521
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:06,000
Yeah, bad with cookies.

522
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:10,480
But if you don't take the cookies as person, you're setting up a world where this person

523
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:15,040
is going to be mercilessly hounding a Girl Scout asking about their cookies.

524
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:16,320
And that's not very nice.

525
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:20,480
Like, that's not a good reality for that poor girl to have to endure.

526
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:25,360
Not only that, but I look at this and I think about all the factors here, right?

527
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:26,640
10 boxes.

528
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:28,320
10 boxes.

529
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:29,280
10 boxes.

530
00:30:29,280 --> 00:30:32,960
And it appears to be rained on, but no damage to the boxes.

531
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:37,280
And it just so happens to be the address of a house you live next to.

532
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:42,880
And you know they're bad people, but you also know that these cookies belong.

533
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:44,720
This is a test of some sort.

534
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:46,800
I've been watching a lot of Good Place.

535
00:30:46,800 --> 00:30:49,280
And I truly believe that this is some sort of ethical-

536
00:30:49,280 --> 00:30:51,520
Because to have all those factors of like-

537
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:52,560
All those factors.

538
00:30:52,560 --> 00:30:56,000
It's just far enough away that you'd have to drive there.

539
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,720
But not so far that like you don't know where it is.

540
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:00,240
You know the people who live there.

541
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:01,680
Somebody's watching you.

542
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:03,520
Yeah, you're being watched.

543
00:31:03,520 --> 00:31:10,000
If there is a van parked across the street from your place and the windows are blacked out,

544
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:12,960
I can give you basically a 100% Griffon macro guarantee

545
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:15,120
that John Quinones is in there somewhere.

546
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:17,680
Because he's run out of ideas pretty much completely

547
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:23,040
based on how many times we reference him in our podcast about situations like this.

548
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:24,640
Here's the problem though.

549
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:26,880
And this is where my dilemma is.

550
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:28,320
This is a good thing to do, right?

551
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:29,600
Taking the cookies back.

552
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:30,720
That is a good thing to do.

553
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:34,720
And by the way, I recognize the whole time that we've been talking about this question,

554
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:37,200
you have been at home, chocolate all over your mouth.

555
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:38,000
Oh no.

556
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:39,920
Oh no, yeah.

557
00:31:39,920 --> 00:31:41,600
But it's a good thing to do.

558
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:46,320
Or alternatively, you've just left a wet cookie crate in your home somewhere,

559
00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:47,840
which is also very unappealing.

560
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:49,920
It's a good thing to do, right?

561
00:31:49,920 --> 00:31:54,240
Taking these cookies back, categorically, unless this is a grift

562
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:56,640
and you are going to be putting this Girl Scout on blast.

563
00:31:56,640 --> 00:32:03,120
And you can not just turn on a fellow grifter like this.

564
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:05,040
Yeah, that's true.

565
00:32:05,040 --> 00:32:06,080
It's really rough.

566
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:09,600
Maybe you could talk to the Girl Scout about maybe cutting you in on the grift.

567
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:10,720
Interesting.

568
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:12,400
Now there's an idea.

569
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:21,280
An unaddressed envelope, you just drop it off at their front door,

570
00:32:21,280 --> 00:32:27,280
is an envelope with one tag along in it as like a warning.

571
00:32:27,280 --> 00:32:28,560
Maybe wrapped in a napkin.

572
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:30,480
I know the grift.

573
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:31,680
I need a taste.

574
00:32:31,680 --> 00:32:33,440
I've run this one so many times.

575
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:35,680
I need into your grift.

576
00:32:35,680 --> 00:32:37,760
And maybe you could actually help with the grift.

577
00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:42,480
Like you could just be like, hi, I'm looking for a tag.

578
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:45,600
I want tag along so much.

579
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:47,520
If you've got some coming, I'll pay you twice.

580
00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:50,960
If you just give me half of it now, half of the money now,

581
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:54,160
I can give you twice as many tag alongs later.

582
00:32:54,160 --> 00:32:56,240
Yeah, the parents might answer the door though.

583
00:32:56,240 --> 00:33:02,480
And you have to be like, hello, your daughter sold me a box of tag along cookies.

584
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:04,400
And because you got to get to her, right?

585
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:06,640
To like set up the grift arrangement.

586
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:11,680
And so you're like, and I don't know how to eat them.

587
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:17,040
So I was hoping to get a little bit more additional details from your little salesperson.

588
00:33:17,680 --> 00:33:24,720
And then the grift is over because you fucked up.

589
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:27,840
I wanted to discuss wine pairings.

590
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:31,040
And I thought maybe she would have some suggestions.

591
00:33:31,920 --> 00:33:32,960
You're going to prison.

592
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:34,240
Actually, if you do wine, you're going to prison.

593
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:35,280
So don't do mine.

594
00:33:35,280 --> 00:33:36,880
Mine seems like a bad idea.

595
00:33:38,160 --> 00:33:39,680
No, oh, this is it.

596
00:33:39,680 --> 00:33:40,800
I figured out the grift.

597
00:33:40,800 --> 00:33:41,840
I figured out the grift.

598
00:33:42,560 --> 00:33:43,200
What's the grift?

599
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:47,280
Okay, the person orders the boxes from the Girl Scout.

600
00:33:47,280 --> 00:33:50,240
The Girl Scout orders them, right?

601
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:53,600
They then say the box never made it to me.

602
00:33:54,160 --> 00:33:56,800
Then another box of 10 tag alongs gets sent.

603
00:33:57,360 --> 00:33:58,800
Then that person pays for it.

604
00:33:58,800 --> 00:34:03,120
Then the Girl Scout goes back, collects the 10 boxes, resells those.

605
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:07,120
Bada bing, bada boom, rolling in money.

606
00:34:07,120 --> 00:34:13,360
So wait, you think that the Girl Scout is in some sort of shipping fulfillment business

607
00:34:14,160 --> 00:34:21,760
where she is handling bulk orders and something went wrong somewhere in the logistical side?

608
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:23,040
And she's counting on you.

609
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:24,880
That's why the address is so close to you.

610
00:34:24,880 --> 00:34:30,000
Counting on you returning the box once the second batch has been ordered.

611
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:33,920
And then that doubles up profits.

612
00:34:33,920 --> 00:34:35,120
It's a profits game.

613
00:34:35,680 --> 00:34:41,760
I don't understand why the Girl Scout has to use somebody's yard as a dead drop for this grift.

614
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:44,080
It seems like she could just keep it somewhere in her home.

615
00:34:44,080 --> 00:34:45,440
Now they come and check that shit.

616
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:47,120
Okay.

617
00:34:47,120 --> 00:34:48,800
The Girl Scouts are very thorough.

618
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:50,320
Very thorough.

619
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:52,720
I think you should return these cookies.

620
00:34:52,720 --> 00:34:55,360
Or one other thing you could do.

621
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:56,800
PO Box 54.

622
00:34:56,800 --> 00:34:56,960
No.

623
00:34:56,960 --> 00:35:00,160
Don't make us complicit in the sin.

624
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:02,880
Yeah, don't make us complicit in the sin.

625
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:04,720
Also, I don't like Tagalongs that much.

626
00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:05,040
What?

627
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:05,680
So...

628
00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:09,360
You scoop out the peanut butter with your teeth, you eat that chunk,

629
00:35:09,360 --> 00:35:10,400
and then you eat the whole cookie.

630
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:11,680
What's not to love?

631
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:12,880
So there is a way to eat Tagalongs.

632
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:13,600
Yes, there is.

633
00:35:13,600 --> 00:35:14,880
There is a correct way.

634
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:16,800
Okay, so maybe the scam is better than I thought.

635
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:18,320
You can say that to the parents like,

636
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:19,760
I need help eating these things.

637
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:21,120
And like, what the fuck are you talking about?

638
00:35:21,120 --> 00:35:25,440
And then you take it and first you press it up into your cheek and you're like,

639
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:26,960
oh, nope, missed again.

640
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,160
Then you take just like a little bit of a nibble.

641
00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:31,920
You're gonna watch me do this whole thing.

642
00:35:33,120 --> 00:35:35,280
Is the nose involved?

643
00:35:36,080 --> 00:35:36,720
Please help.

644
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:39,840
How much tonguey stuff should I be doing?

645
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:41,680
Does she have WhatsApp?

646
00:35:41,680 --> 00:35:42,320
I'll just...

647
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:44,080
I could just hit her up there.

648
00:35:45,120 --> 00:35:45,840
That would be fine.

649
00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:49,280
Listen, if we're gonna buy a bunch of Girl Scout Cookies of our own,

650
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:51,200
I don't know if the season is on or not.

651
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:51,600
I'm just saying...

652
00:35:51,600 --> 00:35:52,080
Oh, it is.

653
00:35:52,080 --> 00:35:54,080
It's on like Donkey Kong, my friend.

654
00:35:54,080 --> 00:35:54,880
Is it on?

655
00:35:54,880 --> 00:35:55,520
Okay.

656
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:57,200
Well, we're gonna need the other money zone.

657
00:35:57,200 --> 00:35:58,400
So let's go.

658
00:36:09,120 --> 00:36:11,280
Our first sponsor this week is Casper.

659
00:36:11,840 --> 00:36:13,440
You like to sleep, coward?

660
00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:15,360
Whoa, huh?

661
00:36:15,360 --> 00:36:15,760
Wow.

662
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:17,200
No, sleep is good.

663
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:18,720
They want sleep to happen in this app.

664
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:19,520
Oh, they want sleep.

665
00:36:19,520 --> 00:36:19,760
Okay.

666
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:20,320
They want...

667
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:20,720
Oh, good.

668
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:20,960
Okay.

669
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:21,680
See, you know what?

670
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:22,560
I should read to the end.

671
00:36:23,120 --> 00:36:24,000
Sleep is good.

672
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:24,400
Yeah.

673
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:28,080
Which is something that Casper, a sleep brand that continues to revolutionize its line of

674
00:36:28,080 --> 00:36:32,400
products to create an exceptionally comfortable sleep experience one night at a time,

675
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:33,200
thinks as well.

676
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:38,160
They offer affordable prices because Casper cuts out the middleman.

677
00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:40,480
And you know, what is the middleman doing to your mattress?

678
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:41,680
A lot of people don't know.

679
00:36:41,680 --> 00:36:44,000
Like, are they getting a sleep in on it?

680
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:46,080
Are they maybe trying it out before you get to it?

681
00:36:46,080 --> 00:36:47,440
You don't have to worry about that with Casper.

682
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:49,680
Is your middleman Tom Brady wearing a big fake mustache?

683
00:36:49,680 --> 00:36:51,360
Because I'll tell you what he's gonna do to your mattress.

684
00:36:51,360 --> 00:36:57,680
Casper Ray mattresses combine multiple, supportive, never fucked Fimmery moans.

685
00:36:57,680 --> 00:37:01,040
Fimmery moans?

686
00:37:01,040 --> 00:37:01,600
Hold on.

687
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:04,160
They combine multiple...

688
00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:04,800
I misread.

689
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:05,280
I'm sorry.

690
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:06,000
I misread.

691
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:06,320
Multiple, supportive...

692
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:08,640
No, it says Fimmery moans here.

693
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:10,000
That's on Casper.

694
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:16,480
Never fucked Fimmery moans for a quality sleep surface that has the right amount of both sink

695
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:18,080
and bounce, Tom.

696
00:37:18,080 --> 00:37:20,960
We will not be paid for this advertisement.

697
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:21,840
That's fine.

698
00:37:21,840 --> 00:37:22,320
I get it.

699
00:37:23,680 --> 00:37:28,560
Kira at Max Fun, go ahead and email us when you want to set up the make good for this ad,

700
00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:30,720
which we will not be compensated for.

701
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:35,920
You can be sure of your purchase with Casper's 100 night risk-free sleep on it trial.

702
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:42,960
Get $50 towards selected mattresses by visiting Casper.com slash my brother

703
00:37:43,680 --> 00:37:46,880
and using promo code my brother at checkout.

704
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:48,000
Terms and conditions apply.

705
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:49,440
I have a really serious question.

706
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:56,800
And we had a lot of fun there, but this question, I think we need to give it sort of the weight

707
00:37:56,800 --> 00:38:00,240
that it deserves because it's heavy.

708
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:08,000
And that is, do you guys think that Tom Brady marries each mattress before he has sex with

709
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:08,560
them?

710
00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:09,060
Yes.

711
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:12,480
I want to tell you about Pro Flowers.

712
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:19,680
I got a beautiful little bouquet of roses sent to me by Pro Flowers last week, and they

713
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:20,640
are so lovely.

714
00:38:21,600 --> 00:38:22,400
It is so exciting.

715
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:25,200
We've gotten Pro Flowers in like this a few times, and it's so nice.

716
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:29,200
I never really think about getting flowers in the house.

717
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:33,680
I'm not much of a plant guy, but it's really nice to just have a beautiful little vase

718
00:38:33,680 --> 00:38:38,320
of flowers just sitting in your house and making everything look good and smell good.

719
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:41,600
And Pro Flowers sets you up like that.

720
00:38:41,600 --> 00:38:42,560
They'll send you a bouquet.

721
00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:43,600
They'll send you the vase you need.

722
00:38:43,600 --> 00:38:46,080
They'll send you the food that you need to keep the flowers fresh.

723
00:38:46,080 --> 00:38:46,800
It's really great.

724
00:38:47,360 --> 00:38:51,840
So an exclusive Valentine's Day bouquet from Pro Flowers is a perfect way to make a big

725
00:38:51,840 --> 00:38:52,720
impression.

726
00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:55,040
Pro Flowers thought inside the box, so you can too.

727
00:38:55,040 --> 00:38:58,960
Their flowers are boxed fresh and delivered fast, so they'll last surprisingly longer.

728
00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:00,000
Seven days at least.

729
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:03,120
You just choose a delivery date, and it's guaranteed making you look good.

730
00:39:03,120 --> 00:39:08,000
Right now, our listeners can send a bouquet to their Valentine or whoever and save 20%

731
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:10,640
off of their purchase of $29 or more.

732
00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:11,680
So hurry and order today.

733
00:39:11,680 --> 00:39:16,160
Valentine's Day is next week to get 20% off your purchase.

734
00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:16,720
Yeah, I know.

735
00:39:16,720 --> 00:39:20,800
To get 20% off your purchase of $29 or more, go to proflowers.com today and use the promo

736
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:24,320
code MYBROTHER in the special codes box at checkout.

737
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:27,600
That's proflowers.com and the code MYBROTHER.

738
00:39:27,600 --> 00:39:29,760
And that's the end of the ad, Pro Flowers.

739
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:31,440
You can stop listening right there.

740
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:36,480
One fun thing is that Pro Flowers is sponsoring three of our podcasts.

741
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:40,960
So I got three boxes of Pro Flowers sent to my house on the same day.

742
00:39:41,600 --> 00:39:47,120
So now it kind of looks like in my house, it kind of looks like I'm trying to hide the

743
00:39:47,120 --> 00:39:52,960
scent of a corpse I buried underneath my floorboards because I have three vases of flowers.

744
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:54,320
Now that is a good question.

745
00:39:54,320 --> 00:39:57,120
How would you cover up the smell of a corpse under your floorboards?

746
00:39:57,120 --> 00:39:58,960
Because for me, it would be Febreze.

747
00:39:58,960 --> 00:40:02,640
I would turn to- with these prices, I don't think you could afford not to use Pro Flowers.

748
00:40:02,640 --> 00:40:08,720
14 Knights of Ahriman is an asymmetrical two player unit and resource management card game.

749
00:40:08,720 --> 00:40:13,920
One player leads the defense of a medieval city while the other controls a reawakening ancient

750
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:14,560
evil.

751
00:40:14,560 --> 00:40:18,400
Each player will take turns building their economy and recruiting powerful units for

752
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:19,840
the ongoing war.

753
00:40:19,840 --> 00:40:24,400
Both players recruit from the same five decks, but a high priest in service to the city behaves

754
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:27,520
quite differently than a cult leader pledged to the dark.

755
00:40:27,520 --> 00:40:34,000
You visit ATOZGame.com or find them on Kickstarter to see more.

756
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:35,280
That sounds awesome.

757
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:35,920
Yeah, that sounds extremely good.

758
00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:36,640
Sounds really cool.

759
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:40,000
I want to get that now.

760
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:44,160
And that's A-A-T-O-Z-Game.com.

761
00:40:44,160 --> 00:40:46,320
A-T-O-Z-Game.com.

762
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:48,160
I'm just gonna go to this website.

763
00:40:48,160 --> 00:40:49,360
This is a nice little website.

764
00:40:49,360 --> 00:40:50,320
This is a nice little website.

765
00:40:50,320 --> 00:40:51,280
This game looks dope as hell.

766
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:53,920
Just gonna go grab this one real quick.

767
00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:55,120
Just can't get this.

768
00:40:55,120 --> 00:40:56,720
While you guys do that, I'll read the next one.

769
00:40:56,720 --> 00:41:02,160
This is for, and these are all exclamation points, so I will try to read it.

770
00:41:02,160 --> 00:41:03,040
Please don't yell.

771
00:41:03,040 --> 00:41:03,760
Please don't yell.

772
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:04,560
I'm not going to yell.

773
00:41:04,560 --> 00:41:05,360
I'm not going to yell.

774
00:41:05,360 --> 00:41:06,960
I'm just saying I edit the show, and so if you yell-

775
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:07,600
I'm not going to yell.

776
00:41:07,600 --> 00:41:07,920
It's a lot of work for me.

777
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:10,000
I'm going to try to say it with excitement.

778
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:18,080
Elena, Ash, Chris, Mike, Riley, Cheryl, Erica, Patrick, Meredith.

779
00:41:18,080 --> 00:41:19,120
No, it is just Sherry.

780
00:41:19,760 --> 00:41:21,920
I think you read the exclamation point from L there.

781
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:24,960
No, that's fine, because there's a free one there, because Sherry, you are included in

782
00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:27,600
this one, and Cheryl, just go make a friend named Sherry-

783
00:41:27,600 --> 00:41:30,320
Cheryl, and that's more free money zone for you.

784
00:41:31,120 --> 00:41:33,280
And this is from Turbles.

785
00:41:33,280 --> 00:41:35,600
To my beloved Vortex, pals.

786
00:41:36,240 --> 00:41:39,760
If all has gone according to plan, you now have a recording of a macro,

787
00:41:39,760 --> 00:41:42,400
exclaiming your name you can use as a ringtone.

788
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:45,120
Yes, I threw one in for myself.

789
00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:46,800
My name is Sherry.

790
00:41:48,240 --> 00:41:51,120
You're all amazing people and good, good friends.

791
00:41:51,120 --> 00:41:55,120
Thank you for being horny for this one, even in the darkest of times.

792
00:41:55,120 --> 00:41:57,040
Love you always, Turbo.

793
00:41:57,040 --> 00:42:01,200
And that's so important that we find the ability, even in the darkest hour,

794
00:42:01,200 --> 00:42:03,440
to still maintain a level of horniness.

795
00:42:04,240 --> 00:42:10,400
Like that's- because sometimes you're like, oh no, everything seems so down and so bleak.

796
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:11,520
And not horny.

797
00:42:11,520 --> 00:42:12,320
But still-

798
00:42:12,320 --> 00:42:13,440
Not horny at all.

799
00:42:13,440 --> 00:42:15,600
I'm so horny for this, you know?

800
00:42:15,600 --> 00:42:17,360
Like, it's so important.

801
00:42:17,360 --> 00:42:20,640
I have a message here for Clara, and it's from Savannah, who says,

802
00:42:20,640 --> 00:42:23,600
to the best wolf mom around, happy 21st.

803
00:42:23,600 --> 00:42:28,160
From Urinetown Ensemble to Company Wives, every show with you is a joy.

804
00:42:28,160 --> 00:42:29,920
Can't wait for you to save the oceans.

805
00:42:29,920 --> 00:42:32,320
I love you to shrimp heaven and back.

806
00:42:32,320 --> 00:42:36,160
So does all of Hoof and Horn, which is why they pitched in for this Jumbotron.

807
00:42:36,160 --> 00:42:42,240
Love, Julia, Wes, Karen, Maddie, Libby, Shana, Adam, Cole, Booty, and Savannah.

808
00:42:42,240 --> 00:42:44,480
One of those names is not like the other.

809
00:42:44,480 --> 00:42:46,640
And it's- it's Karen.

810
00:42:46,640 --> 00:42:50,560
Karen, I love when we get a Jumbotron that makes me go,

811
00:42:51,680 --> 00:42:51,920
what?

812
00:42:51,920 --> 00:42:53,920
I want to know about these people.

813
00:42:53,920 --> 00:42:54,160
Yeah.

814
00:42:54,160 --> 00:42:55,440
I want to know all about this.

815
00:42:55,440 --> 00:42:57,360
These sound like great people.

816
00:42:57,360 --> 00:42:59,520
Are they all in the Piss musical?

817
00:42:59,520 --> 00:43:00,320
I don't know.

818
00:43:00,320 --> 00:43:02,240
Are they in the Piss musical?

819
00:43:02,240 --> 00:43:03,440
What is Hoof and Horn?

820
00:43:03,440 --> 00:43:05,280
Is it like Skull and Bones?

821
00:43:05,280 --> 00:43:07,440
But for, you know, Buffalo?

822
00:43:07,440 --> 00:43:08,160
But for Buffalo?

823
00:43:08,160 --> 00:43:09,360
But for Buffaloes?

824
00:43:09,360 --> 00:43:11,360
Is this a message for like nine buffaloes?

825
00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:13,920
So what's the story here, y'all?

826
00:43:13,920 --> 00:43:16,800
Do buffaloes like being used in Magic Acts?

827
00:43:16,800 --> 00:43:17,600
Absolutely.

828
00:43:17,600 --> 00:43:18,240
They love it.

829
00:43:20,400 --> 00:43:20,960
Yeah, Mark.

830
00:43:20,960 --> 00:43:21,840
Hey, buddy.

831
00:43:21,840 --> 00:43:22,640
Oh, hey, what's up, man?

832
00:43:23,200 --> 00:43:26,160
So I'm at this mafia restaurant.

833
00:43:26,160 --> 00:43:26,480
What?

834
00:43:26,480 --> 00:43:31,280
I'm going to go in and ask these guys what they think the best pasta shape is.

835
00:43:31,280 --> 00:43:32,640
Mark, they're probably eating-

836
00:43:32,640 --> 00:43:35,360
I have a hunch that it's probably ravioli.

837
00:43:35,360 --> 00:43:36,000
But I mean, you know what?

838
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:36,720
That's a good idea.

839
00:43:36,720 --> 00:43:40,080
Whatever they're eating, I'll just take a look in their bowls and see what they have.

840
00:43:40,080 --> 00:43:40,240
Maybe-

841
00:43:40,240 --> 00:43:41,600
There's supposed to be a big meeting there today.

842
00:43:41,600 --> 00:43:42,960
Can you see it from the street?

843
00:43:42,960 --> 00:43:44,320
That sounds really dangerous.

844
00:43:44,320 --> 00:43:45,680
I'm just going to go inside and ask.

845
00:43:45,680 --> 00:43:46,880
Don't, don't bother them.

846
00:43:46,880 --> 00:43:48,160
They're probably eating, you know-

847
00:43:48,160 --> 00:43:49,520
Look, I'm not threatened by them.

848
00:43:49,520 --> 00:43:52,480
How about we tell them what the best pasta is on our podcast?

849
00:43:52,480 --> 00:43:53,760
We got this with Mark and Hal.

850
00:43:53,760 --> 00:43:54,880
Oh, that's a great idea.

851
00:43:54,880 --> 00:43:55,760
Thank God.

852
00:43:55,760 --> 00:43:56,720
Tuesdays at nine?

853
00:43:56,720 --> 00:43:58,400
On MaximumFun.org.

854
00:43:58,400 --> 00:43:59,760
Hey, I love that show.

855
00:44:02,800 --> 00:44:04,720
Here comes the Unready Yahoo for you.

856
00:44:04,720 --> 00:44:05,360
I just picked it up.

857
00:44:06,240 --> 00:44:07,920
God, but I was-

858
00:44:07,920 --> 00:44:12,880
I was really excited.

859
00:44:12,880 --> 00:44:14,080
I want a munch!

860
00:44:14,080 --> 00:44:14,560
Squad!

861
00:44:17,440 --> 00:44:19,280
I want to munch!

862
00:44:19,280 --> 00:44:20,320
Squad!

863
00:44:20,320 --> 00:44:23,440
Are you trying not to wake somebody up because it was a very reserved-

864
00:44:23,440 --> 00:44:26,400
Nah, I'm just getting over a little bit of a bug.

865
00:44:26,400 --> 00:44:27,280
Welcome to Munch Squad.

866
00:44:27,280 --> 00:44:29,040
It's a podcast within a podcast.

867
00:44:30,480 --> 00:44:31,440
I do want to get-

868
00:44:33,600 --> 00:44:34,880
There's an elephant in the room.

869
00:44:34,880 --> 00:44:36,640
The elephant is shaped like nachos.

870
00:44:36,640 --> 00:44:37,680
Olive Garden.

871
00:44:37,680 --> 00:44:38,640
Yes, I know.

872
00:44:38,640 --> 00:44:40,320
There are nachos at Olive Garden.

873
00:44:40,320 --> 00:44:41,120
Justin!

874
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:42,880
What's wrong, Griff?

875
00:44:44,160 --> 00:44:45,440
This is not what the-

876
00:44:45,440 --> 00:44:46,400
This is the worst-

877
00:44:46,400 --> 00:44:49,600
This is so much worse than Taco Bell doing fries.

878
00:44:49,600 --> 00:44:52,400
This is so much worse than that.

879
00:44:52,400 --> 00:44:54,240
But that's not what the episode's about today.

880
00:44:54,240 --> 00:44:58,080
I just want to mention, I know that, but they don't have the fucking guts.

881
00:44:58,640 --> 00:45:05,200
They don't have the guts to make a press release about

882
00:45:05,200 --> 00:45:12,960
their loaded pasta chips, which are chips made of pasta with stuff dumped on them.

883
00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:15,120
They don't have the guts to do a press release for it.

884
00:45:15,120 --> 00:45:20,000
This is just pasta they ruined, and now they're trying to find a way to get it out?

885
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:21,920
It's extremely al dente.

886
00:45:21,920 --> 00:45:25,200
It's extremely al dente.

887
00:45:25,200 --> 00:45:26,480
It's Alfred dente.

888
00:45:27,200 --> 00:45:29,600
Cherry peppers in an Alfredo drizzle.

889
00:45:29,600 --> 00:45:31,600
Oh my god.

890
00:45:31,600 --> 00:45:35,840
It's chilling, but they don't have the guts to do a press release, so I can't do-

891
00:45:36,480 --> 00:45:38,800
Yeah, you have to send me a press release, folks.

892
00:45:38,800 --> 00:45:40,720
That's the only way this segment works.

893
00:45:40,720 --> 00:45:43,040
And I do have one here from Einstein Bros.

894
00:45:44,640 --> 00:45:50,560
They're the bros that make bagels, and they introduce breakfast-themed alarm tones.

895
00:45:52,640 --> 00:45:56,080
So Einstein Brothers, a place that sells bagels,

896
00:45:56,080 --> 00:46:04,240
announced the launch of Wake Up Tones for limited edition downloadable alarm tones

897
00:46:04,240 --> 00:46:11,120
that mimic morning breakfast essentials to help people wake up on the right side of the bed

898
00:46:11,120 --> 00:46:15,360
in time for the most important meal of the day, breakfast.

899
00:46:15,360 --> 00:46:28,080
Now, if you visit einsteinbros.com slash wake up, you can download the free mp3 alarm tone.

900
00:46:28,080 --> 00:46:34,800
Direct your mobile device, and you get a coupon for an egg sandwich.

901
00:46:34,800 --> 00:46:36,160
Now, here's the thing.

902
00:46:36,160 --> 00:46:43,440
So the consumer that this program is for is the consumer that is like,

903
00:46:43,440 --> 00:46:51,520
like, I really need the sound of bacon sizzling or coffee brewing to use as a very,

904
00:46:51,520 --> 00:46:58,480
I would assume, ineffective alarm, but I just don't know where to get the glossy mp3 file to upload.

905
00:46:58,480 --> 00:47:02,240
So what they're supposing here is that I'm going to go to-

906
00:47:02,240 --> 00:47:05,920
I'm going to type in the web address einsteinbros.com slash wake up.

907
00:47:05,920 --> 00:47:10,560
I want to pick from bacon, coffee, a rooster crowing, or eggs frying.

908
00:47:10,560 --> 00:47:14,800
I'm going to pick one of those mp3s to download.

909
00:47:14,800 --> 00:47:15,120
Yeah.

910
00:47:15,120 --> 00:47:21,520
Now, only one of those seems to me to be of alarm sound quality.

911
00:47:22,080 --> 00:47:27,040
I've never heard eggs frying and covered my ears and thought, oh, god, no, so loud.

912
00:47:27,040 --> 00:47:30,560
The ineffectiveness, I think, is what we're getting at there.

913
00:47:30,560 --> 00:47:32,480
I don't see how that would work very well.

914
00:47:32,480 --> 00:47:36,080
So this is a fun thing we can do because this is an audio program.

915
00:47:36,080 --> 00:47:40,640
Let's just play eggs frying right now just so we can have a conversation about it.

916
00:47:45,440 --> 00:47:46,640
Rise and shine.

917
00:47:46,640 --> 00:47:52,240
Sizzling bacon, fresh cracked eggs, and warm delicious bagels aren't going to eat themselves.

918
00:47:52,240 --> 00:47:53,680
Go ahead, get up.

919
00:47:53,680 --> 00:47:57,680
Let Einstein Brothers Bagels handle breakfast so you can handle your day.

920
00:47:58,480 --> 00:48:00,880
So there's a few problems here with eggs frying.

921
00:48:00,880 --> 00:48:05,280
The first is that the sound that starts off is quiet, not loud enough to wake you up.

922
00:48:05,280 --> 00:48:11,920
If it does wake you up, it also kind of sounds like the sound of, I don't know, drywall being

923
00:48:11,920 --> 00:48:18,240
ablaze, which is maybe not like, oh, god, oh, god, oh, god, smashed through the window

924
00:48:18,240 --> 00:48:23,840
every time your phone goes off because you think that a fire has taken the house.

925
00:48:24,400 --> 00:48:25,440
That's a challenge.

926
00:48:25,440 --> 00:48:31,360
The other challenge is the, I'm sorry, stranger who has wandered into your bedtime routine

927
00:48:31,360 --> 00:48:33,840
to yell at you about this bagel store.

928
00:48:33,840 --> 00:48:38,800
These eggs aren't going to eat themselves is maybe the weirdest phrase to use to wake

929
00:48:38,800 --> 00:48:39,440
someone up.

930
00:48:39,440 --> 00:48:44,080
And you know, if you're going to go that far to have a voice in it, why not just make

931
00:48:44,080 --> 00:48:48,000
that like, here's somebody telling you to get the fuck up.

932
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:53,200
Like, that seems to me a more- this is not an eggs frying alarm clock.

933
00:48:53,200 --> 00:48:57,200
This is a human voice saying, hey, go eat some eggs.

934
00:48:57,200 --> 00:48:58,400
At Einstein Brothers.

935
00:48:58,400 --> 00:49:01,520
Can we just, can we just before, can we just sample coffee brewing?

936
00:49:01,520 --> 00:49:05,840
Yeah, I wanted to talk about coffee brewing also because there's a sound and it sounds

937
00:49:05,840 --> 00:49:07,040
a little like something else.

938
00:49:07,040 --> 00:49:08,080
And let's go ahead and tune in.

939
00:49:12,640 --> 00:49:13,520
Good morning.

940
00:49:13,520 --> 00:49:15,440
Time to conquer another day.

941
00:49:15,440 --> 00:49:20,480
Stop by Einstein Brothers Bagels for an incredible breakfast and cup of coffee to set your day

942
00:49:20,480 --> 00:49:21,600
up for success.

943
00:49:21,600 --> 00:49:22,320
You got this.

944
00:49:23,280 --> 00:49:24,000
Good morning.

945
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:25,600
It's time to take a piss.

946
00:49:25,600 --> 00:49:27,680
It's definitely, I'm definitely already pissing.

947
00:49:27,680 --> 00:49:28,960
And guess what, pal?

948
00:49:28,960 --> 00:49:33,360
You are too, right now, because this is the sound you chose to woke up to today.

949
00:49:33,360 --> 00:49:40,720
Every so often in Munch Squad, I like, Justin will talk about a food and I will think who

950
00:49:40,720 --> 00:49:41,680
will want that.

951
00:49:41,680 --> 00:49:43,280
And then I think somebody.

952
00:49:43,280 --> 00:49:47,120
There's somebody who is experiencing some kind of food challenge.

953
00:49:47,120 --> 00:49:52,160
I myself just recently on Trends Like These, we were talking about a bagel place that for

954
00:49:52,160 --> 00:49:55,040
the Super Bowl was making a pretzel, excuse me, a big game.

955
00:49:55,040 --> 00:50:00,480
Tony was making a pretzel bagel with mint chocolate chip spread on it.

956
00:50:01,440 --> 00:50:01,920
Hell yeah.

957
00:50:01,920 --> 00:50:03,120
Yeah, it sounds really good.

958
00:50:03,120 --> 00:50:05,600
And here's the thing about this.

959
00:50:05,600 --> 00:50:12,800
I don't only wonder who would want these, but also like the amount of work you would

960
00:50:12,800 --> 00:50:16,000
have to go to to actually put these onto your phone.

961
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:17,040
It would be tremendous.

962
00:50:17,040 --> 00:50:22,400
It would be a tremendous, it's a tremendous, hey listen, if you're a higher ranked member

963
00:50:22,400 --> 00:50:28,080
of the Schmear Society, which is actually a thing that they call their fans, I guess,

964
00:50:29,600 --> 00:50:30,960
it doesn't, you want this.

965
00:50:30,960 --> 00:50:34,400
You want these strangers to be the first voice that you hear in the morning.

966
00:50:34,400 --> 00:50:39,600
You want the sound of this hot, troubled piss to be the first thing that you hear in the

967
00:50:39,600 --> 00:50:42,960
morning, because you hear that hot, troubled piss and you think Einstein Brothers sounds

968
00:50:42,960 --> 00:50:43,920
pretty good right about now.

969
00:50:43,920 --> 00:50:51,760
You also, if they're, what if you were married and you, I think that's fair grounds for

970
00:50:51,760 --> 00:50:56,400
divorce, is like every morning my husband Jeffrey, who I love very much, wakes up to

971
00:50:56,400 --> 00:51:01,680
a piss alarm and then a man yells at him to go to Einstein Brothers.

972
00:51:01,680 --> 00:51:05,360
Let me just say, let me just say also, if you're the sort of person that would download

973
00:51:05,360 --> 00:51:10,160
an Einstein Brothers ringtone to serve as your alarm, you do not need a reminder to

974
00:51:10,160 --> 00:51:11,760
go to Einstein Brothers.

975
00:51:11,760 --> 00:51:16,560
I have to imagine that is your first fucking thought every day when you wake up, is I have

976
00:51:16,560 --> 00:51:19,120
got to get to Einstein Brothers right away.

977
00:51:19,120 --> 00:51:24,480
Now I think we have an opportunity here though, because they clearly missed the point here,

978
00:51:24,480 --> 00:51:25,520
Einstein Brothers did.

979
00:51:25,520 --> 00:51:29,680
But I mean, I think there's a lot of opportunity here and maybe we could just knock out a few

980
00:51:30,720 --> 00:51:32,400
wake up alarms for them.

981
00:51:32,400 --> 00:51:34,320
Like I have some coffee right here, so I could go like,

982
00:51:37,520 --> 00:51:41,360
hot damn, get your ass to Einstein's partner.

983
00:51:42,560 --> 00:51:45,120
That'll wake people up, I feel like.

984
00:51:45,120 --> 00:51:47,840
The sound is bad, doesn't sound like piss.

985
00:51:47,840 --> 00:51:48,560
Uh huh.

986
00:51:48,560 --> 00:51:52,400
And then the voice is just more of a command.

987
00:51:52,400 --> 00:51:53,680
That'll get your pants on.

988
00:51:53,680 --> 00:51:55,840
Let me see what foley stuff I have around here.

989
00:51:55,840 --> 00:51:56,960
Here, let me try this.

990
00:52:00,160 --> 00:52:04,960
A lot of paperwork at the office you gotta do, you better wake up good, just stop by

991
00:52:04,960 --> 00:52:05,520
outside.

992
00:52:05,520 --> 00:52:08,320
Try that again but yell it like louder, because it's not gonna, it's got a long.

993
00:52:08,320 --> 00:52:11,040
And try to make the paperwork sound less like farting.

994
00:52:11,040 --> 00:52:12,640
Yeah, it sounded a lot like a big toot.

995
00:52:13,200 --> 00:52:13,700
Okay.

996
00:52:13,700 --> 00:52:14,200
Okay.

997
00:52:17,540 --> 00:52:20,580
That paperwork isn't gonna complete itself.

998
00:52:20,580 --> 00:52:21,940
Louder, get louder at the end.

999
00:52:22,820 --> 00:52:23,320
Okay.

1000
00:52:24,420 --> 00:52:26,660
Start off kind of quiet but then get louder.

1001
00:52:26,660 --> 00:52:27,160
Okay.

1002
00:52:30,500 --> 00:52:32,980
That paperwork isn't gonna do itself.

1003
00:52:34,100 --> 00:52:35,700
Time to get some brothers.

1004
00:52:35,700 --> 00:52:44,580
Bagels, coffee, they're not picky, you can have whatever you want at Einstein Brothers

1005
00:52:44,580 --> 00:52:46,980
Bagels or other places that have bagels.

1006
00:52:46,980 --> 00:52:48,020
I'm not getting a cut.

1007
00:52:48,580 --> 00:52:52,820
My name is Enrique Iglesias and I recorded this voicemail just for you.

1008
00:52:52,820 --> 00:52:53,320
Perfect.

1009
00:52:53,780 --> 00:52:54,900
Was it a voicemail?

1010
00:52:54,900 --> 00:52:56,740
It was a voicemail.

1011
00:52:56,740 --> 00:53:03,060
Also leave a message, leave a message at the sound of the bacon.

1012
00:53:03,060 --> 00:53:08,260
If you, if you are not a coward you will download these and make them your voicemail message.

1013
00:53:10,900 --> 00:53:14,820
I was calling to talk to a human being but certainly I couldn't have reached that

1014
00:53:14,820 --> 00:53:16,260
considering your voicemail message.

1015
00:53:16,820 --> 00:53:17,320
Jesus.

1016
00:53:18,260 --> 00:53:19,300
Let me try another one.

1017
00:53:19,300 --> 00:53:20,340
Oh yeah, try just one more.

1018
00:53:21,300 --> 00:53:26,980
Bacon, bacon, bacon, bacon, bacon, bacon, bacon, bacon, bacon, bacon, bacon, Kevin Bacon.

1019
00:53:27,780 --> 00:53:29,300
You've reached Kevin Bacon's phone?

1020
00:53:29,300 --> 00:53:31,780
Leave a message at the numbers at the top, at the...

1021
00:53:31,780 --> 00:53:32,740
Leave a message.

1022
00:53:34,580 --> 00:53:36,580
If you know Kevin Bacon you can get that to him.

1023
00:53:37,860 --> 00:53:39,140
So here's Yahoo.

1024
00:53:39,140 --> 00:53:41,940
This one was sent in by level 9000 Yajur Jujur Davenport.

1025
00:53:41,940 --> 00:53:46,820
We've done one similar to this before but it's, this one has some exciting sort of options for us.

1026
00:53:46,820 --> 00:53:49,380
It's Yahoo Answers user...

1027
00:53:49,380 --> 00:53:54,820
Orange Glow Ahoy asks, I need a catchphrase.

1028
00:53:54,820 --> 00:53:55,320
Help.

1029
00:53:56,420 --> 00:53:57,380
Here they is.

1030
00:53:57,940 --> 00:53:58,440
One.

1031
00:53:59,380 --> 00:54:00,580
I like a do what?

1032
00:54:00,580 --> 00:54:01,380
I like a do what?

1033
00:54:03,780 --> 00:54:04,280
Two.

1034
00:54:04,820 --> 00:54:06,900
Oyster burger a palooza.

1035
00:54:08,340 --> 00:54:08,840
Three.

1036
00:54:09,700 --> 00:54:10,820
Hack it, why don't ya?

1037
00:54:12,900 --> 00:54:13,700
End of options.

1038
00:54:13,700 --> 00:54:16,100
So, I thought we could...

1039
00:54:16,660 --> 00:54:23,700
We have a lot of great stuff here in the writers room and I figured we could just kind of weigh

1040
00:54:23,700 --> 00:54:26,820
them because obviously it's got to be one of these three.

1041
00:54:26,820 --> 00:54:30,980
I feel like this is the new sort of like personality test of what kind of person you are.

1042
00:54:30,980 --> 00:54:35,700
Like hack it, why don't you just want to leave the party a little bit earlier than everybody else

1043
00:54:35,700 --> 00:54:39,780
because they need to, you know, go home and recuperate some of their energy.

1044
00:54:40,500 --> 00:54:45,940
Here's my question and I'm really trying to rack my brain for a catchphrase from a popular

1045
00:54:46,500 --> 00:54:50,660
media thing that, I mean, maybe got me cheese.

1046
00:54:51,780 --> 00:54:52,180
Question.

1047
00:54:52,180 --> 00:54:54,900
I'm looking for a question catchphrase.

1048
00:54:54,900 --> 00:54:57,940
What was the other catchphrase Trav that...

1049
00:54:57,940 --> 00:55:00,420
I was trying to remember this last night because I was showing my daughter

1050
00:55:01,700 --> 00:55:03,060
some Urkel clips on YouTube.

1051
00:55:04,100 --> 00:55:07,780
What was the catchphrase that you identified that we didn't recognize?

1052
00:55:07,780 --> 00:55:08,740
Not while I'm pouring?

1053
00:55:08,740 --> 00:55:11,380
Not while I'm pouring.

1054
00:55:11,380 --> 00:55:12,500
Yeah, that was a good...

1055
00:55:12,500 --> 00:55:12,900
I forget.

1056
00:55:12,900 --> 00:55:14,100
I want to watch that clip now.

1057
00:55:14,100 --> 00:55:14,980
He had a lot of them.

1058
00:55:15,540 --> 00:55:16,420
Yeah, it was almost like

1059
00:55:16,980 --> 00:55:20,100
Urkel was purely written to just have catchphrases.

1060
00:55:20,900 --> 00:55:22,020
It's weird, yeah.

1061
00:55:22,020 --> 00:55:23,460
I like a do what?

1062
00:55:23,460 --> 00:55:25,860
I like a do what is so good.

1063
00:55:25,860 --> 00:55:27,620
Let's circle back to I like a do what.

1064
00:55:27,620 --> 00:55:27,940
Okay.

1065
00:55:27,940 --> 00:55:29,700
Because I think it has the most promise.

1066
00:55:29,700 --> 00:55:38,100
Oysterburgerpalooza, the use case for that one is gonna be quite limited, I worry.

1067
00:55:38,100 --> 00:55:42,180
Well, also, it's got a lot of hard syllables in it.

1068
00:55:42,740 --> 00:55:46,180
Like, it doesn't exactly drip from the tongue.

1069
00:55:46,180 --> 00:55:47,780
It's hard to say.

1070
00:55:47,780 --> 00:55:48,420
Yeah.

1071
00:55:48,420 --> 00:55:50,180
It takes a long time to say, too.

1072
00:55:50,180 --> 00:55:53,300
People are gonna be tuning out in the middle of your catchphrase.

1073
00:55:53,300 --> 00:55:57,140
Also, it's straight up dookie nonsense.

1074
00:55:57,140 --> 00:55:59,620
And the other two are, yes, also that.

1075
00:55:59,620 --> 00:56:03,060
But they at least form semi-coherent thoughts.

1076
00:56:03,060 --> 00:56:06,740
Now, I actually see a lot of promise for hack it, why don't you?

1077
00:56:06,740 --> 00:56:08,740
Because that seems like a good thing.

1078
00:56:08,740 --> 00:56:10,260
Like, if somebody's complaining like,

1079
00:56:10,980 --> 00:56:15,860
oh, I can't get my iPhone to connect to the...

1080
00:56:15,860 --> 00:56:17,220
Well, hack it, why don't you?

1081
00:56:17,220 --> 00:56:20,660
Because in this day and age of people trying to figure out constant life hacks.

1082
00:56:20,660 --> 00:56:22,260
Oh, I see.

1083
00:56:22,260 --> 00:56:24,740
Yeah, 10 things you didn't know your iPhone could do,

1084
00:56:25,460 --> 00:56:27,380
that kind of like YouTube, you're just like,

1085
00:56:27,380 --> 00:56:29,700
ugh, this guy, hack it, why don't you?

1086
00:56:29,700 --> 00:56:32,740
And it could both be used to encourage someone

1087
00:56:32,740 --> 00:56:34,740
to figure out how to use their device properly,

1088
00:56:34,740 --> 00:56:36,500
but also it's kind of a snarky like,

1089
00:56:36,500 --> 00:56:39,220
oh, why don't you just tell me about some life hacks?

1090
00:56:39,220 --> 00:56:40,820
Just hack it, why don't you?

1091
00:56:40,820 --> 00:56:42,660
I think it means like hack it, like...

1092
00:56:43,460 --> 00:56:44,500
Yeah, that's how I read it.

1093
00:56:44,500 --> 00:56:46,100
Like, oh, you just can't hack it.

1094
00:56:46,100 --> 00:56:48,340
Oh, buddy, hack it, why don't you?

1095
00:56:49,220 --> 00:56:52,100
But I do think Travis is right.

1096
00:56:52,100 --> 00:56:54,500
And we're wrong, we're the wrong ones,

1097
00:56:54,500 --> 00:56:57,140
because it could just be like,

1098
00:56:57,140 --> 00:57:00,180
I'm having a lot of trouble getting big wins

1099
00:57:00,180 --> 00:57:01,380
in PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds.

1100
00:57:01,380 --> 00:57:03,620
It's like, well, hack it, why don't you?

1101
00:57:03,620 --> 00:57:07,380
Get some, look through walls, do some cheats on there.

1102
00:57:07,380 --> 00:57:10,100
I get the appeal now of hack it, why don't you?

1103
00:57:10,100 --> 00:57:11,940
But can I just offer this up?

1104
00:57:13,140 --> 00:57:14,180
I like to do what?

1105
00:57:14,180 --> 00:57:15,540
I like to do what?

1106
00:57:15,540 --> 00:57:16,180
Here's what I like.

1107
00:57:16,180 --> 00:57:17,220
It's so good.

1108
00:57:17,220 --> 00:57:20,580
It's rare to find a catchphrase, as I said, that is a question.

1109
00:57:20,580 --> 00:57:23,380
It's even rarer to find a catchphrase

1110
00:57:23,380 --> 00:57:26,260
that is both a question and a response

1111
00:57:26,260 --> 00:57:28,260
to something someone else has just said

1112
00:57:28,900 --> 00:57:31,540
that is so specific that someone would be like,

1113
00:57:31,540 --> 00:57:33,060
Travis, do you like crosswords?

1114
00:57:33,060 --> 00:57:34,820
I like to do what?

1115
00:57:34,820 --> 00:57:35,860
Crosswords.

1116
00:57:35,860 --> 00:57:36,180
Yes.

1117
00:57:36,820 --> 00:57:37,540
Yes, I do.

1118
00:57:37,540 --> 00:57:38,340
Thank you for asking.

1119
00:57:38,340 --> 00:57:40,660
Yes, thank you for reconfirming that.

1120
00:57:41,220 --> 00:57:44,820
I got some good ones here though from Yahoo Answerage.

1121
00:57:44,820 --> 00:57:45,940
Thank you, God, thank you.

1122
00:57:45,940 --> 00:57:51,060
I want to thank God and Jesus, just my heaven friends,

1123
00:57:51,060 --> 00:57:51,620
for this one.

1124
00:57:51,620 --> 00:57:54,100
How much longer do we have on the Yahoo Answers, by the way?

1125
00:57:54,100 --> 00:57:54,980
Do we have a timetable?

1126
00:57:54,980 --> 00:57:57,780
Because they definitely killed Instant Messenger.

1127
00:57:57,780 --> 00:57:58,100
Yeah.

1128
00:57:58,100 --> 00:58:04,340
And like, I mean they and like the broad sense here.

1129
00:58:04,340 --> 00:58:05,140
Kim Trails.

1130
00:58:05,940 --> 00:58:08,740
Kim Trails, they killed it because they didn't have the guts.

1131
00:58:10,580 --> 00:58:12,260
It can't have long, right?

1132
00:58:12,260 --> 00:58:13,060
Probably not long.

1133
00:58:13,060 --> 00:58:17,300
Probably not long, so let's gather our delicious rosebuds

1134
00:58:17,300 --> 00:58:19,540
that we're going to eat like you do with rosebuds.

1135
00:58:20,340 --> 00:58:22,020
Proflowers.com.

1136
00:58:22,020 --> 00:58:24,660
Proflowers, they're the tastiest rosebuds.

1137
00:58:24,660 --> 00:58:25,220
They're edible.

1138
00:58:25,780 --> 00:58:27,460
Well, everything is, if you try hard enough.

1139
00:58:27,460 --> 00:58:29,060
Yahoo Answers user question mark says,

1140
00:58:29,780 --> 00:58:31,540
don't light your farts on a hayride.

1141
00:58:31,540 --> 00:58:33,540
And again, the use case for this one.

1142
00:58:34,260 --> 00:58:34,820
Narrow.

1143
00:58:34,820 --> 00:58:38,580
It's more of a folksy idiom, I would say.

1144
00:58:39,540 --> 00:58:41,860
Catchphrases have to be broadly applicable.

1145
00:58:41,860 --> 00:58:44,260
I mean, the fact that, shh, not why I'm pouring,

1146
00:58:44,260 --> 00:58:46,900
got as many uses as it did is kind of an anomaly.

1147
00:58:48,020 --> 00:58:49,380
This user who's just an emoji,

1148
00:58:49,380 --> 00:58:50,740
so I'm not going to try to pronounce that,

1149
00:58:51,860 --> 00:58:53,220
says, eat my shorts.

1150
00:58:53,220 --> 00:58:55,540
And it's a good one, but the problem with that is that

1151
00:58:55,540 --> 00:58:57,220
it was already used.

1152
00:58:57,220 --> 00:58:58,580
Well, just take it and turn it.

1153
00:58:58,580 --> 00:58:59,780
Don't eat my shorts.

1154
00:58:59,780 --> 00:59:01,940
Hey, stop eating my shorts.

1155
00:59:01,940 --> 00:59:03,140
Stop eating my shorts.

1156
00:59:03,140 --> 00:59:04,180
Again, the use case.

1157
00:59:04,740 --> 00:59:07,620
No, you could use it if somebody kind of like

1158
00:59:07,620 --> 00:59:08,980
don't blow smoke up my ass.

1159
00:59:08,980 --> 00:59:10,500
It would be like, if someone was like, hey,

1160
00:59:10,500 --> 00:59:11,780
I really think you're doing a great job.

1161
00:59:11,780 --> 00:59:13,140
I'm like, listen, man, I don't need it.

1162
00:59:13,140 --> 00:59:13,940
Stop eating my shorts.

1163
00:59:13,940 --> 00:59:15,380
I don't need anybody eating my shorts right now.

1164
00:59:16,900 --> 00:59:18,900
Smiley says-

1165
00:59:18,900 --> 00:59:21,380
Someone eating my shorts is the last thing I need, okay?

1166
00:59:22,740 --> 00:59:24,660
Don't eat my shorts and tell me it's a goat.

1167
00:59:27,460 --> 00:59:29,060
Listen, people have been eating my shorts

1168
00:59:29,060 --> 00:59:30,180
around here all morning.

1169
00:59:30,180 --> 00:59:31,860
Just be straight with me, Doug.

1170
00:59:31,860 --> 00:59:33,860
Is it a good presentation or not?

1171
00:59:33,860 --> 00:59:35,140
Don't eat my shorts on this one.

1172
00:59:35,140 --> 00:59:36,500
Hey, Valerie, we're all counting on you.

1173
00:59:36,500 --> 00:59:37,700
Don't eat your shorts, okay?

1174
00:59:37,700 --> 00:59:38,740
Just don't eat your shorts.

1175
00:59:39,780 --> 00:59:40,580
This is your moment.

1176
00:59:40,580 --> 00:59:41,620
You're the anchor here, okay?

1177
00:59:41,620 --> 00:59:42,420
Don't eat your shorts.

1178
00:59:42,420 --> 00:59:43,380
You're the anchor.

1179
00:59:43,380 --> 00:59:45,860
This is your moment to shine at the big presentation.

1180
00:59:45,860 --> 00:59:46,980
Don't eat your shorts.

1181
00:59:46,980 --> 00:59:47,780
Go in there.

1182
00:59:47,780 --> 00:59:49,460
You make them eat their shorts.

1183
00:59:50,820 --> 00:59:53,380
14 seconds on the clock in the fourth period

1184
00:59:53,380 --> 00:59:56,260
and Tom Brady just has wide open receivers

1185
00:59:56,260 --> 00:59:58,740
and he really eats the shorts on this one, folks.

1186
01:00:00,740 --> 01:00:01,860
I'm not going to eat my shorts.

1187
01:00:01,860 --> 01:00:03,060
I'm not going to eat my shorts.

1188
01:00:03,060 --> 01:00:04,340
I'm not going to eat my shorts.

1189
01:00:04,340 --> 01:00:08,500
A big, stinky mouthful of shorts for Thomas Brady.

1190
01:00:08,500 --> 01:00:10,740
He's basically chewing the shorts at this point.

1191
01:00:12,020 --> 01:00:14,420
Smiley says, winner, winner, chicken dinner.

1192
01:00:14,420 --> 01:00:16,420
Or when you go out with friends to eat,

1193
01:00:16,420 --> 01:00:19,220
when the bill comes, tell them you got the tip.

1194
01:00:19,220 --> 01:00:20,820
Always wear clean underwear

1195
01:00:20,820 --> 01:00:22,980
or look both ways when crossing the street.

1196
01:00:23,700 --> 01:00:25,140
That's like a routine.

1197
01:00:25,140 --> 01:00:27,460
It's not a catchphrase.

1198
01:00:27,460 --> 01:00:28,660
And the best one here's from

1199
01:00:28,660 --> 01:00:39,060
sportswithaz55 said, where did you buy those clothes?

1200
01:00:39,060 --> 01:00:40,100
At the toilet store?

1201
01:00:43,220 --> 01:00:44,740
It's a mean catchphrase,

1202
01:00:45,300 --> 01:00:49,780
but I mean, some catchphrases are transgressive.

1203
01:00:49,780 --> 01:00:51,540
Well, now here's what's interesting about this.

1204
01:00:53,460 --> 01:00:55,540
I guess it could be considered a catchphrase,

1205
01:00:55,540 --> 01:01:00,020
but it is also a joke from Anchorman

1206
01:01:00,020 --> 01:01:03,620
in which someone is trying to make a joke in the movie

1207
01:01:03,620 --> 01:01:05,380
and fails.

1208
01:01:05,380 --> 01:01:06,260
Well, that's a good point.

1209
01:01:06,260 --> 01:01:08,260
Can we just do more jokes from Anchorman

1210
01:01:08,260 --> 01:01:10,500
on our fucking podcast without realizing it?

1211
01:01:10,500 --> 01:01:12,180
Has it been long enough now?

1212
01:01:12,820 --> 01:01:14,180
I mean, shit, dude.

1213
01:01:14,180 --> 01:01:15,940
I ate the shorts hard on that one.

1214
01:01:19,460 --> 01:01:20,340
Oh, God.

1215
01:01:21,220 --> 01:01:21,720
Damn it.

1216
01:01:22,500 --> 01:01:24,180
Now it's making me wonder how many other things

1217
01:01:24,180 --> 01:01:25,300
we ate the shorts on and said,

1218
01:01:25,300 --> 01:01:30,820
like, an Anchorman thing throughout the last 392 episodes.

1219
01:01:30,820 --> 01:01:36,260
I mean, the jokes per minute in that film is a lot.

1220
01:01:36,260 --> 01:01:39,140
And so it's kind of, you kind of used them all up, I think.

1221
01:01:39,140 --> 01:01:41,060
Well, and also they use a lot of words in there

1222
01:01:41,060 --> 01:01:42,740
that if we said, like, you know, coffee,

1223
01:01:42,740 --> 01:01:44,820
and it's like, oh, they said coffee once on Anchorman.

1224
01:01:44,820 --> 01:01:45,460
That was an Anchorman reference.

1225
01:01:45,460 --> 01:01:46,660
Yeah, I mean, we said coffee a lot

1226
01:01:46,660 --> 01:01:49,300
when we were talking about the Einstein Brothers stupid thing.

1227
01:01:49,300 --> 01:01:51,220
And I think we said San Diego before.

1228
01:01:51,220 --> 01:01:52,980
That's an Anchorman reference.

1229
01:01:52,980 --> 01:01:57,300
Damn it.

1230
01:01:57,300 --> 01:01:58,180
Nanu Nanu.

1231
01:01:58,180 --> 01:01:58,900
That's a good one.

1232
01:01:58,900 --> 01:01:59,860
That's a good catchphrase.

1233
01:02:00,740 --> 01:02:01,860
That's a good one because it's,

1234
01:02:01,860 --> 01:02:04,100
um, you can use it pretty much anytime

1235
01:02:04,100 --> 01:02:05,940
that you don't have something different to say.

1236
01:02:05,940 --> 01:02:09,140
I don't think so is a good one,

1237
01:02:09,140 --> 01:02:10,340
but you have to say it like that.

1238
01:02:11,540 --> 01:02:12,020
That's fine.

1239
01:02:12,020 --> 01:02:13,540
Because if you say, I don't think so,

1240
01:02:13,540 --> 01:02:13,780
that's not a catchphrase.

1241
01:02:13,780 --> 01:02:15,300
I like to do what?

1242
01:02:15,300 --> 01:02:16,180
I like to do what?

1243
01:02:16,180 --> 01:02:17,140
I like to do what?

1244
01:02:19,540 --> 01:02:20,660
It does land.

1245
01:02:20,660 --> 01:02:21,620
It does land.

1246
01:02:21,620 --> 01:02:23,300
All right, let's end the episode.

1247
01:02:24,100 --> 01:02:25,300
So that's the end of our show.

1248
01:02:25,300 --> 01:02:28,820
Hey, I'm doing the voice of a guy named Very Deadward

1249
01:02:28,820 --> 01:02:30,260
on a show called Slug Riot.

1250
01:02:30,260 --> 01:02:35,380
And you can find that at vrv.co and search for Slug Riot.

1251
01:02:36,020 --> 01:02:38,260
It's a fun animated series about a guy

1252
01:02:38,260 --> 01:02:39,620
who makes a mold core band.

1253
01:02:39,620 --> 01:02:41,060
His sister tries to make him bring it back.

1254
01:02:41,060 --> 01:02:41,460
It's fun.

1255
01:02:41,460 --> 01:02:42,500
The episode's like three minutes longer.

1256
01:02:42,500 --> 01:02:42,820
Check it out.

1257
01:02:42,820 --> 01:02:43,380
You'll like it.

1258
01:02:43,380 --> 01:02:45,300
I destroyed my voice doing it.

1259
01:02:45,300 --> 01:02:46,500
So please enjoy it.

1260
01:02:46,500 --> 01:02:47,220
Make it worth it.

1261
01:02:48,180 --> 01:02:48,980
Yeah, make it worth it.

1262
01:02:48,980 --> 01:02:50,500
Also, that's where you can find my brother.

1263
01:02:50,500 --> 01:02:51,940
My brother and me to stream.

1264
01:02:51,940 --> 01:02:53,220
If you want to watch the episodes

1265
01:02:53,220 --> 01:02:55,700
and own them for your very own,

1266
01:02:55,700 --> 01:03:00,580
you can do so now via Google Play or on iTunes.

1267
01:03:00,580 --> 01:03:01,780
You can get them there.

1268
01:03:02,500 --> 01:03:04,660
And so thank you again to everybody who got that.

1269
01:03:04,660 --> 01:03:09,380
And we take that to number one on the TV charts.

1270
01:03:09,380 --> 01:03:11,700
We put up a commentary for episode two

1271
01:03:11,700 --> 01:03:14,580
to thank everybody so you can hear the three of us

1272
01:03:14,580 --> 01:03:16,900
and director and showrunner J.D. Amato.

1273
01:03:16,900 --> 01:03:21,860
That's in just our regular My Brother, My Brother, and Me feed

1274
01:03:21,860 --> 01:03:23,700
if you want to listen to the commentary

1275
01:03:23,700 --> 01:03:25,300
and watch the episode at the same time.

1276
01:03:26,900 --> 01:03:27,620
I also want to say,

1277
01:03:27,620 --> 01:03:31,940
so I put together a secret society show here in Cincinnati.

1278
01:03:31,940 --> 01:03:34,340
It's not so secret anymore if you're talking about it.

1279
01:03:34,340 --> 01:03:35,620
Well, here's what it is.

1280
01:03:35,620 --> 01:03:37,140
I'm going to tell you where it is,

1281
01:03:37,140 --> 01:03:38,660
when it is, and how to get tickets.

1282
01:03:38,660 --> 01:03:41,380
But the guests are a secret mystery.

1283
01:03:41,380 --> 01:03:42,740
I can tell you right now,

1284
01:03:42,740 --> 01:03:46,740
I've got six amazing guests that I know who they are

1285
01:03:46,740 --> 01:03:49,140
and it's pretty good.

1286
01:03:49,140 --> 01:03:50,260
You did a pretty good job.

1287
01:03:50,260 --> 01:03:52,100
And I'm also pretty excited to say

1288
01:03:52,100 --> 01:03:53,940
it's already three quarters of the way sold out

1289
01:03:53,940 --> 01:03:57,300
and we're still about two months away from the show.

1290
01:03:57,300 --> 01:03:58,340
So it has allowed us to go ahead

1291
01:03:58,340 --> 01:04:00,740
and start planning for the show for April two.

1292
01:04:00,740 --> 01:04:04,180
And so I'm hoping that this will become an every month thing

1293
01:04:04,180 --> 01:04:05,780
and it seems like people are into it.

1294
01:04:06,580 --> 01:04:08,740
It's the Cincinnati Underground Society Show.

1295
01:04:09,620 --> 01:04:11,140
If you want to get tickets, they're $15.

1296
01:04:11,700 --> 01:04:13,780
And once we cover the expenses,

1297
01:04:13,780 --> 01:04:16,580
50% of profits are going to go towards next month's show.

1298
01:04:16,580 --> 01:04:18,340
And the other 50%, I'm going to donate

1299
01:04:18,340 --> 01:04:19,860
to a local Cincinnati charity.

1300
01:04:20,420 --> 01:04:24,820
You can get tickets at bit.ly forward slash cussmarch.

1301
01:04:24,820 --> 01:04:28,500
C-U-S-S-M-A-R-C-H, because it is the March show.

1302
01:04:29,620 --> 01:04:30,900
And I'm also working,

1303
01:04:30,900 --> 01:04:34,420
you might've seen the great logo made by Justin Russo.

1304
01:04:35,300 --> 01:04:37,780
And I'm also working on some like enamel pins

1305
01:04:37,780 --> 01:04:38,900
and stuff for the show.

1306
01:04:38,900 --> 01:04:41,060
And profits from that will also go to the charity.

1307
01:04:42,100 --> 01:04:46,020
But yeah, if you want to get tickets, bit.ly slash cussmarch.

1308
01:04:46,020 --> 01:04:50,100
The show is March 30th and I hope to see you there.

1309
01:04:50,100 --> 01:04:50,500
Also-

1310
01:04:50,500 --> 01:04:52,180
Real quick, can you tell us about the Joko Cruise?

1311
01:04:52,180 --> 01:04:56,100
Yeah, so this is the last week to get your tickets

1312
01:04:56,100 --> 01:04:59,220
for the ticket booking on the Joko Cruise.

1313
01:04:59,940 --> 01:05:02,100
Some of those performers include Amy Mann,

01:05:02,100 --> 01:05:07,380
Jonathan Colton, Jean Grey, Cameron Esposito,

1315
01:05:07,380 --> 01:05:08,180
and Rhea Butcher.

1316
01:05:09,060 --> 01:05:10,740
Teresa and I are going to be there.

1317
01:05:10,740 --> 01:05:12,020
Our dad is going to be there.

1318
01:05:12,020 --> 01:05:16,260
Will Wheaton, Matt Fraction, all kinds of-

1319
01:05:16,260 --> 01:05:17,140
Fraction's going to be there?

1320
01:05:17,140 --> 01:05:19,620
Yeah, all kinds of really cool people are going to be there.

1321
01:05:20,580 --> 01:05:24,180
And you can come hang out with us on this boat for a week

1322

of the first arc of the Adventure Zone balance

1327

called Here There Be Gerblin's.

1328
01:05:39,540 --> 01:05:41,620
And it's coming out this summer

1329
01:05:41,620 --> 01:05:44,980
and you can pre-order it right now at theadventurezonecomic.com.

1330
01:05:44,980 --> 01:05:46,820
Also want to thank John Roderick and the Long Winters

1331
01:05:46,820 --> 01:05:47,620
for the use of our theme song,

1332
