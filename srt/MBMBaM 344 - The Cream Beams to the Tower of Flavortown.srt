1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:30,640
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:47,760
Hello everybody, and welcome to My Brother, My Brother, Me, and the Advice Show for the

6
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:52,400
modern era. I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy. I'm your middle-est brother, Travis McElroy.

7
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:56,400
I'm your sweet baby brother, 30 under 30 media luminary, Griffin McElroy.

8
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:58,880
You said you had something funny to say, Griffin.

9
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:05,600
It's just, I, the ox, the ox, the oxers were last night, and we all had, I think we can all agree,

10
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:11,600
a really fun time watching them. Got a little silly there at the end.

11
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:17,120
Now, Griffin, was that, was that silly like in the way of when they like drop candy and donuts from

12
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:23,040
the sky silly, or? That was very silly, but they did something even sillier at the end that I

13
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:26,480
thought was- Oh, do you mean like when they brought in the tour group, and they were like,

14
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:30,400
you're going to look at dresses, but it was actually like- That was super silly,

15
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:34,240
and it was just sort of Jimmy's sort of patented sort of prank.

16
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:38,960
Do you mean when they fucking robbed our dear friend, Lin-Manuel Miranda,

17
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:43,760
of his deserved Oscar that he deserved for writing the best song of the year?

18
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:45,360
Is that what you mean, Griffin? That they robbed him?

19
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:49,440
On that note, this is uncalled for. And us, by extension, by the way.

20
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:53,680
Because he would have called that great job horn so many times from that podium.

21
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:57,440
It's the closest I would have ever gotten to winning an Oscar, and they took that from me.

22
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:05,440
Yes, that is, that was uncomfortable. And I know we were all there for our friend,

23
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:09,520
Lin, when he was robbed during that scene. Although this part's actually not silly.

24
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:18,240
This is actually kind of uncomfortable in that I'm afraid that our friendship with Lin is over

25
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:22,400
now, and now La La Land is my best friend. Is that right? Does that make sense?

26
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:24,560
That's uncomfortable. That seems unpleasant.

27
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:30,880
We have a TV show now, so we have to keep swinging to the next sexiest Vine.

28
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:34,800
And he's been a sexy Vine for such a long time, and a really good dude,

29
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:38,240
like a super, super good dude. But friendship with Lin is over now.

30
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:43,200
La La Land is now my best friend. Gonna find out the name of the person who did it?

31
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:48,880
Because I watched this, I didn't see the movie, but I've seen pictures of it.

32
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:52,000
And I know it's Ryan Gosling, and he's in there playing piano.

33
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,160
But did he play the, did he actually make the songs?

34
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:56,720
It's unclear.

35
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:57,760
It's a confusing movie.

36
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:07,840
I haven't seen La La Land yet, but the scene that they used to be like Ryan Gosling for Best Actor

37
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:14,560
is a scene of a person at a jazz club while jazz people are trying to play jazz.

38
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:20,160
And here's this person in the audience at full voice talking about what's going on.

39
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:24,400
And all I can think is that person needs to be removed from this place.

40
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:27,040
That's not real jazz, man.

41
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:32,960
But at some point, a host or a server should have come over and said,

42
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:35,200
excuse me, sir, could you shut the fuck up?

43
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,520
Yeah, I mean, that's the secret.

44
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:45,680
A member of the Marsalis family or Cannonball, they don't talk during jazz.

45
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:49,520
That's like the rule one of jazz. Rule two is just make a bunch of stuff up.

46
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:52,480
But like Cannonball will tell you, do not talk during the jazz.

47
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:53,360
That's the second rule.

48
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:55,440
No eye contact during jazz.

49
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:56,560
No, God, no.

50
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:59,200
Yeah. And then the third rule is just make a bunch of shit up.

51
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:00,880
And yeah, good luck.

52
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:10,480
No, the silly part is talking about where Faye and Warren who are two national sort of treasures,

53
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:14,880
masters of the stage and screen, masters of their craft.

54
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:16,720
Like they're both masters of their craft, you know,

55
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:19,840
and they've they've they've accomplished some great works between the two of them.

56
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:24,320
But they did remind us that they are still older folks.

57
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:26,240
It's not their fault.

58
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:34,080
Well, if I'm sorry, if you know you're dishing out best pick at the end,

59
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:38,720
the big show and you get handed a card that has Emma Stone's name on it,

60
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:44,240
I think you would go there's been a mistake before you just pull the fucking trigger

61
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:48,720
and just say another this card says Emma Stone won best picture.

62
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:49,520
Get up here, Emma.

63
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:50,320
You did it.

64
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:51,840
Can we get a good movie?

65
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:52,800
I want to dissect.

66
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:54,480
I want to dissect that moment for a second,

67
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:57,600
because I think Warren Beatty got a lot of heat for that moment.

68
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:59,680
I think he's going to continue to get a lot of shade thrown out.

69
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:02,000
Well, first of all, I think that's undeserved

70
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,880
because I think Faye is the one that took that ball and ran with it.

71
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:07,840
That's what I'm saying, because Warren Beatty opens the envelope was like,

72
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:09,520
wait, Emma Stone's not a movie.

73
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:12,000
Warren Beatty knows Emma Stone is not a movie.

74
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,960
And Faye Dunaway goes, oh, you're terrible.

75
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:18,240
And all I can think is inside Warren Beatty's head,

76
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:21,280
he must have just been screaming, Faye, no.

77
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:28,880
Faye at that point made a fucking risk reward sort of evaluation

78
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:33,120
and decided I don't want to be up on this stage anymore in this uncomfy moment.

79
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:35,600
So I'm just going to pull the trigger on this fucking thing

80
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:40,480
without even like blocking down whether or not I'm saying the name of the real best pick.

81
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:43,040
It's weird that Emma Stone's name is so big on this card,

82
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:45,600
but whatever, I'll read the movie name smaller.

83
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:50,720
I just feel like what we're seeing is old Hollywood

84
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:55,360
still having its instincts in place for heat seeking.

85
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:58,720
My man Warren and my lady Faye are nothing if not heat seekers.

86
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:02,960
They saw that and they thought my man Warren looked at that card

87
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:04,480
and you know what crosses mind?

88
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:06,400
Time to go trending.

89
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:10,080
Time to get back in the fucking limelight.

90
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:11,840
Have I had sex with Emma Stone?

91
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:12,800
I'm Warren Beatty.

92
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:17,200
I'm Warren Beatty, but also now time to trend.

93
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:20,560
Time to get on this comet and trend with me, Faye.

94
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:21,840
Hey Faye, take my hand.

95
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:24,400
Take my hand and follow me.

96
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:25,600
It's time to trend.

97
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:28,240
I have no idea what that means, but I want to do it.

98
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:29,680
I do want to do it.

99
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:32,560
I hear a lot of people trending and it's time to trend, Faye.

100
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:33,200
Come with me.

101
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:38,160
Catch this comet in a net with me, Faye, and fly to trending.

102
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:45,840
Is it possible that this really silly thing that happened here at the end-

103
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:46,960
It's a zag.

104
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:48,640
I mean, let's call it a good fucking zag.

105
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:50,320
It's a fucking zag at half.

106
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:51,440
It's a silly switch up.

107
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:57,040
Do you think that this was done somehow as sort of a magic trick prank

108
00:06:57,040 --> 00:07:04,720
by Now You See Me Too as a sort of like slight for being slighted by the Oscar noms?

109
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:07,600
Anything's possible.

110
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:11,280
I really wish La La Land could have won it because that's my best friend now

111
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:14,880
and I would have loved it to have that feather in its cap.

112
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:17,440
But super congratulations to Moonlight.

113
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:23,040
I should say I would love, love, love to talk about all the movies

114
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:25,280
and if they deserved it and who won what.

115
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:31,840
I saw, let me see, 0.01% of the movies nominated

116
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:34,800
and that's just like the 10 minutes I was awake

117
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:38,400
during Dr. Strange.

118
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:40,160
Not because Dr. Strange was a boring movie.

119
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:41,840
I had just had a baby.

120
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:43,680
So I was just very asleep.

121
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:45,040
Took it to sleep, sleepberg.

122
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:47,600
I'm thinking about being a parent of a young child

123
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:50,320
when you're watching the Oscars for me this year.

124
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:56,960
Most of the awards I was about engaged with and as like versed in

125
00:07:57,520 --> 00:08:00,480
as if I was watching awards for lawn furniture design.

126
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:04,400
Like it might as well have been that until the animated segment

127
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:08,080
at which point I was like on my feet losing it.

128
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:12,800
Like just like listing off the merits and demerits

129
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:14,320
of all the nominated pictures.

130
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:15,920
How do you, let's get into this.

131
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:17,360
How do you feel about Zootopia?

132
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:18,080
Taking the big one.

133
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:20,400
Zootopia has a great message.

134
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:20,800
Yes.

135
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:24,000
And it's that animals deserve to be people.

136
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:25,120
Something like that.

137
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:28,640
Well, it's not really that so much.

138
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:32,160
Zootopia is a fine film with a great message.

139
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:36,880
Does it make me cry every time I watch it when she's like,

140
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:39,360
I am Moana and I'm like, me too.

141
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:42,240
And I'm on my feet crying and screaming at the screen?

142
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:42,640
Yeah.

143
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:44,240
No, absolutely not.

144
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:46,880
But it's a movie about discrimination,

145
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:50,240
which seems like a good message for right now.

146
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:50,640
Yeah.

147
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:54,800
How to do it in a good way that's very secret and no one will know about.

148
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:56,560
Wait, hold on.

149
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:58,560
I haven't seen Zootopia, Justin.

150
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:01,360
Is Zootopia about how to get away with racism?

151
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:03,120
No, it's about.

152
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:04,000
Okay.

153
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:08,240
No, but I'll tell you what it's not about, inspiring a generation.

154
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:12,080
Well, it probably is also about, it is kind of like also that.

155
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:12,640
I get you.

156
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:15,840
I mean, I get you, but yeah.

157
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:20,080
They're both fine pictures.

158
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:22,720
Moana is obviously better, but it's fine.

159
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:26,160
I tried to watch Kubo, but it was a little bit dark

160
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:28,560
and my daughter lost interest in 10 minutes.

161
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:30,800
So I'll give that one a Razzie.

162
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:32,000
That one gets a Razzie from me.

163
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,280
Just because it was just again,

164
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:35,440
just because the colors were a little muted.

165
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:38,560
Well, colors were dark and there wasn't a big musical number

166
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:39,760
within the first 10 minutes.

167
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:42,880
Can I say just before we move on for the Oscars,

168
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:48,320
I would like to give my own award and this is 100% all sincerity.

169
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:52,400
Best jacket at the Oscars goes to Dwayne The Rock Johnson.

170
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:53,360
Oh, was it?

171
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:54,320
That jacket.

172
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:57,280
Oh, it was an amazing like blue velvet number.

173
00:09:57,280 --> 00:10:01,760
Oh, I fell in love with it right away.

174
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:04,560
And now we gotta do our worst dress segment.

175
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:07,120
Can you even believe they left the house in it?

176
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:08,640
And I'll start things out.

177
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:13,440
Josh Gad was just, he was wearing, he's wearing just a suit,

178
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:16,240
but his wiener was hanging out the whole time.

179
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:18,320
But really the problem was the shoulder pads.

180
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:21,760
The shoulder pads were a bit wild, yes.

181
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:23,040
The wiener was fine.

182
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:26,160
The wiener was excellent.

183
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:31,360
I liked when Deadpool jumped up, ran up on the stage

184
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:33,840
and he was like, I'm gonna let you finish.

185
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:36,320
But actually Deadpool was the best.

186
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:38,800
That was like very good viral and his butt was out

187
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:40,720
and he was like, fart you very much.

188
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:44,320
He said fart you very much and it was like kind of inappropriate

189
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:46,800
because it was like La La Land won and then they got up

190
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:48,480
and they're like, no, we didn't, Moonlight won

191
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:50,080
and then Moonlight got up to accept his award

192
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:53,040
and then he ran up and he was like, Deadpool won, I'm sorry.

193
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:55,040
I didn't know that the other thing was gonna happen

194
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:58,160
and now this is all getting a little over complicated.

195
00:10:58,160 --> 00:10:59,200
Can we go back?

196
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:00,720
Can we edit this?

197
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:02,480
No, Mr. Reynolds.

198
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:06,560
Anyway, if anybody has La La Land's phone number

199
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:08,960
and or wants to like tell them about our show

200
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:11,120
so I can get that certifier going.

201
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:13,600
Can we not joke about this, please?

202
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:15,440
Because Lin will take it very personally.

203
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:17,440
It's not personally, but seriously,

204
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:20,160
and he'll take the joke too far and he'll stop talking to us

205
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:22,000
and he'll make us talk to La La Land

206
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,280
and that's a movie, not a person.

207
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:26,400
I don't stand with Griffin on this, Lin.

208
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:29,120
Anyway, that's our skewed take on the Oscars.

209
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:30,640
It's our skewed views.

210
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:32,560
Why don't we do more movie stuff?

211
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:33,760
We've got a lot to say.

212
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:37,120
Suicide Squad won a, what, it did?

213
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:40,000
So that's like could be one whole segment

214
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,320
and it's like Hacksaw Ridge, really?

215
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:44,240
That could be a whole different segment.

216
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:48,240
Neither one of those movies have I seen.

217
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:49,040
No, God, no.

218
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:50,880
They don't give it to the movies that I like,

219
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:54,400
which is like the movies that I saw in the theater.

220
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:55,760
Because I'm looking down the list,

221
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:58,800
I saw, I did see Deadpool in the theater.

222
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:00,240
That got a nom?

223
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:05,120
No noms for Deadpool on this one.

224
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:06,640
Maybe we'll nominate it next year.

225
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:09,760
You know how they always do like Stuff We Missed?

226
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:10,080
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

227
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:11,760
Or like Missed Connections?

228
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:15,360
I should see movies that don't have superheroes in them,

229
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:17,280
I think, if I want to get the most out of the Oscars.

230
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:19,760
The Doctor Strange got a nom.

231
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:22,640
It got the nom for the best effect things.

232
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:26,800
Hey, also while we're talking about best effects Oscars,

233
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:29,760
if I could bend your ear for a second,

234
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:34,240
I think I'm with you in that it's very funny

235
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:36,800
that no one understands the technical awards.

236
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:38,720
Like that's hysterical, I'm with you.

237
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:45,040
Maybe that doesn't have to be the joke every single year

238
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:47,120
and multiple times per show.

239
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:49,840
Like at some point don't you just expect

240
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:52,000
those special effects wizards to stand up and say,

241
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,040
we get it!

242
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:54,880
Or alternatively they say,

243
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:56,240
fuck you, we're taking a year off.

244
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:58,160
And then Jurassic World 2 comes out

245
00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:01,280
and all the dinosaurs are just like fucking dudes

246
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:03,920
in those stupid inflatable costumes and that's it.

247
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:06,480
And then the next year it's like, okay guys, we're sorry.

248
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:07,840
This year the technical Oscars

249
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:09,200
are the only Oscars we're gonna do.

250
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:11,520
The best actress was handed out

251
00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:13,680
in a non-televised segment of the show.

252
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:18,480
But anyway, here's a new way of fucking a new stylus

253
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:19,760
that you can use to draw shit.

254
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:21,120
But it's amazing.

255
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:22,720
I think it's horrible that the people

256
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:25,440
who actually make the movies get cloistered off

257
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:29,760
to their sub Oscars, but best animated short?

258
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:30,320
Like really?

259
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:30,720
Those animated shorts were amazing though.

260
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:32,960
Unless it's before Pixar movie, nobody saw it.

261
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:34,480
They were amazing though.

262
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:36,160
Here's my problem with it.

263
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:39,120
We really are doing this fucking thing.

264
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:40,560
Year over year they're like,

265
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:42,320
technical we don't even know what's going on.

266
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:44,000
And guaranteed there's people that work

267
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,040
in the technical field like,

268
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:47,200
oh, okay, well we'd be happy to explain it to you.

269
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:50,640
Nope, no, you'd ruin the joke.

270
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:53,920
It's like, we just don't get it.

271
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:55,760
Did you see fucking Finding Dory?

272
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:57,120
We made all of it.

273
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:58,080
All of it was me.

274
00:13:58,080 --> 00:13:59,520
It was me, my name's Clark

275
00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:01,920
and I made Finding Dory with my computer.

276
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:04,480
If they had spent half the time,

277
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:06,400
they spent joking about not understanding them

278
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:07,680
to actually explaining them,

279
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:12,640
we would all have like minors in special effect

280
00:14:13,280 --> 00:14:15,120
design work engineering.

281
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:15,920
That would be amazing.

282
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:17,760
Next year, Andrew Garfield gets up

283
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:19,200
to present the technical Oscars

284
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:20,160
and he gets up and he goes,

285
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:22,160
I'm supposed to talk about how I don't understand that.

286
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:24,000
That's the shit they've written for me here.

287
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,160
And he just throws away the script

288
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:27,840
and he like sits down at a table

289
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:29,920
and has a three hour long conversation

290
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:32,160
about the new like refraction lenses.

291
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:36,000
He pulls a fucking Justin Trudeau up there.

292
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,160
He's like, well, I'll break this shit down.

293
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:38,960
How long you got?

294
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:41,120
The history of the camera.

295
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:46,240
Here's the best part is it's all wrong and lies

296
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:47,840
but it is three hours long.

297
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:50,640
Here's how I bet it works.

298
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:54,320
And now I've never used a camera

299
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:55,440
but if I had to guess,

300
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:59,520
okay, time to get into the advice.

301
00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:00,720
Here's my first question.

302
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:03,280
Yesterday, I went to a used video store

303
00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:04,160
and I tried to buy a copy

304
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:05,920
of the Denzel Washington movie, Unstoppable.

305
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:08,080
Denzel was robbed again.

306
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:09,680
It's the greatest act of our time.

307
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:11,280
I took the case to the register

308
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:14,080
but the girl couldn't find the disc in the filing cabinet.

309
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:15,680
She took my name and phone number

310
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:17,680
and said she'd call when and if they found it.

311
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:18,320
Here's the problem.

312
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:21,440
I don't actually want Unstoppable that badly.

313
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:25,360
If I never go back to pick it up, am I good?

314
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:31,440
And that's from somewhat of Unstoppable,

315
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:32,400
somewhat Stoppable.

316
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:35,280
Yeah, I mean, a lot of issues.

317
00:15:35,280 --> 00:15:37,920
This is the wild train movie, right?

318
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:39,680
Where Denzel has to fight a big train

319
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:42,000
with the help of Captain Kirk.

320
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:42,800
I think so.

321
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:48,800
A lot of Hollywood glitz in this episode, I think.

322
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:50,160
Yeah, a lot of that razzle-dazzle.

323
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:51,840
No stars in the sky tonight.

324
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:53,520
They are all in this episode.

325
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:57,280
I think I used to work at a GameStop

326
00:15:57,280 --> 00:16:02,080
and if you came in and you tried to buy SSX trains,

327
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:04,240
SSX Tricky, and I was like, I can't find the disc.

328
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:06,160
I'll take your name down and if I find the disc,

329
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:06,800
I'll let you know.

330
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:10,400
That's just sort of a salve for you

331
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:12,080
to try to get you to leave the store

332
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:13,760
because I ain't gonna find that disc.

333
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:19,440
If it's not right in the SSX section of my folio,

334
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:22,080
then I'm not going to locate the disc.

335
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:25,200
In three months, when fucking Halo 8 comes out

336
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:27,200
and I am stocking up Halo 8,

337
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:30,000
a fucking SSX Tricky disc is not going to fall

338
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,160
from a hidden crevice in the cabinet.

339
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:34,160
That disc is gone and the game is gone forever.

340
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:35,600
Unstoppable is gone.

341
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:37,280
It got dragged to hell and I'm very sorry.

342
00:16:37,280 --> 00:16:39,760
Somebody threw it in the fucking garbage can or stole it.

343
00:16:39,760 --> 00:16:40,880
That is how it does.

344
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:44,000
Griffin, let me paint a counter picture for you.

345
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:47,600
One in which miracles can happen and angels do exist.

346
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:50,160
Let me take down your number.

347
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:54,000
I'll call you as soon as we find a copy of it.

348
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:54,960
They find it.

349
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:56,880
They call them like, oh, okay, yeah, great.

350
00:16:57,520 --> 00:16:59,760
And then the next day, somebody else comes in and say,

351
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:01,360
hey, is that Unstoppable?

352
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:03,440
No, this is for Dave.

353
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:05,600
This is Dave's copy.

354
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:07,120
And then Dave doesn't come in.

355
00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:08,400
And then the next day, somebody else is like,

356
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:09,520
ooh, Unstoppable.

357
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:10,960
I've been meaning to check that out.

358
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:13,200
Can I please buy that VHS copy?

359
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:15,440
No, this is Dave's copy.

360
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:18,080
But after a while, the store clerk begins

361
00:17:18,080 --> 00:17:19,440
to lose faith in Dave.

362
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:22,960
And then by extension, humanity, sadness reigns.

363
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:24,560
Is that it?

364
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:25,600
The fin.

365
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:28,080
Oh, Jesus, Travis, I thought there was going to be a turn.

366
00:17:28,080 --> 00:17:30,080
No, that's the thing, Griffin, there is no turn

367
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:32,000
because Dave did not go get Unstoppable.

368
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:36,160
I have a fun story along these lines.

369
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:37,120
A friend in college.

370
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:41,440
Used to work at Blockbuster and stole a copy of Showgirls.

371
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:42,720
Yeah, tell me all about this friend.

372
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:44,320
I didn't steal a copy of Showgirls.

373
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:45,280
I stole a copy of Fight Club.

374
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:46,640
It's in our fucking TV show.

375
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:48,480
Cisto.com, free week.

376
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:50,640
I forgot, you're only allowed to steal one thing

377
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:51,760
when you work at Blockbuster.

378
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:56,000
No, I had Tommy Redd come over and videotape Showgirls off HBO

379
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,120
while we were on vacation.

380
00:17:57,120 --> 00:18:00,880
Anyway, a friend of mine was working in a video store in LA

381
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:08,240
and Lance Henderson came in and he asked for a Millennium

382
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:11,840
and the guy working the desk said,

383
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:16,720
do you want the 1989 movie or do you want the TV show?

384
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:19,760
And Lance Henderson said, I want the one with me in it.

385
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:24,000
Because Lance Henderson is the star of the TV series.

386
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:28,880
So I don't know what this world is that Lance has to go

387
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:31,280
rent his own copy of Millennium, the series,

388
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:33,840
on a videocassette, presumably.

389
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:37,200
But I always get a kick out of that story.

390
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:39,360
Do y'all want a yahoo?

391
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:40,560
Yeah, please.

392
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:44,480
So I'm gonna send him by riding high Zoe Kinski.

393
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:45,840
Thank you Zoe, it's yahoo answers user.

394
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:47,200
Sorry, something's gone wrong.

395
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:48,400
I'm gonna try one refresh.

396
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:49,760
I'm gonna give this a little bit of bandwidth

397
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:54,320
and see if we can't, no, this dog won't bark.

398
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:59,840
It's from Joey who asks, I am naming all of my pants.

399
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:01,600
Let's start with the torn Wranglers

400
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:03,600
with spaghetti sauce on the left leg.

401
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:04,320
Any ideas?

402
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:05,440
I'm very fond of them.

403
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:08,960
It's just like a fun way of like categorize,

404
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:11,520
like you need to know, you need to know,

405
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:13,760
like you open up the drawer and it's like,

406
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:15,280
what jeans do I want to wear today?

407
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:16,160
And it's like at this point,

408
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:17,760
I have like eight or nine pairs of jeans.

409
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:19,760
You know, I'm on TV.

410
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:23,920
And so I need like a way of like a shorthand way

411
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:25,120
of like knowing who they are.

412
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:26,320
One more time.

413
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:29,680
Torn Wranglers, spaghetti sauce on the left leg.

414
00:19:29,680 --> 00:19:30,960
If you'd like, I can start you off

415
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:34,000
with some responses for yahoo.

416
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:35,440
Yeah, that'd be great.

417
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:38,320
Katz says Italian Stallions.

418
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:40,400
That's fun, but I think we can do better.

419
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:43,200
And just like that, here comes Dolores in the prune

420
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:50,080
who says rip, mess well, Tom Longstrand,

421
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:53,600
Basil Pastowski.

422
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:58,080
Sally says, how about naming them

423
00:19:58,080 --> 00:20:00,000
after the Swiss national hero, William Tell?

424
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,560
The missing drawstring has been used for this crossbow.

425
00:20:02,560 --> 00:20:04,400
The hole where he was aiming for the apple

426
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:06,080
in your pocket but lost his concentration.

427
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:08,080
He got a whiff of cheese mixed with something

428
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:10,880
he didn't quite recognize as emanating from his homeland.

429
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:11,520
Fuck right off.

430
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:12,020
What?

431
00:20:12,020 --> 00:20:12,660
What?

432
00:20:12,660 --> 00:20:15,540
Why are we wasting the best minds of our generation?

433
00:20:15,540 --> 00:20:17,220
The most creative talents of our generation

434
00:20:17,220 --> 00:20:18,580
on yahoo answers.

435
00:20:18,580 --> 00:20:21,140
Enzyme 303 says Rangweenie.

436
00:20:21,140 --> 00:20:23,220
It has that spaghetti Western feel to it.

437
00:20:23,220 --> 00:20:25,140
Perfect name for the good, bad, and the ugly.

438
00:20:25,860 --> 00:20:27,220
That's actually pretty good.

439
00:20:27,220 --> 00:20:29,220
There's four fucking pages of answers

440
00:20:29,220 --> 00:20:29,620
to naming this person's jeans.

441
00:20:29,620 --> 00:20:31,380
So these people are just trying to name their pants

442
00:20:31,380 --> 00:20:32,500
that has spaghetti on them?

443
00:20:34,420 --> 00:20:34,920
Why?

444
00:20:35,620 --> 00:20:36,260
Why?

445
00:20:36,260 --> 00:20:38,020
Play along, yes and.

446
00:20:38,020 --> 00:20:40,420
But what's the, play with me.

447
00:20:40,420 --> 00:20:42,100
But I need to know for what?

448
00:20:42,100 --> 00:20:44,260
For the National Pants Registry?

449
00:20:44,260 --> 00:20:45,300
Like, where does this come up?

450
00:20:45,300 --> 00:20:45,780
Is this just like-

451
00:20:45,780 --> 00:20:47,060
Play with me.

452
00:20:47,940 --> 00:20:49,700
But Griffin, I need to know.

453
00:20:50,900 --> 00:20:53,300
I need to know the parameters of when you might say

454
00:20:53,300 --> 00:20:56,180
this name out loud to fully understand.

455
00:20:57,140 --> 00:20:58,660
Because like, mess pants.

456
00:20:58,660 --> 00:20:59,940
Why not just mess pants?

457
00:20:59,940 --> 00:21:00,340
These are mess pants.

458
00:21:00,340 --> 00:21:02,180
Mess pants is good, but you can do better.

459
00:21:02,180 --> 00:21:03,940
Just play with me.

460
00:21:03,940 --> 00:21:04,980
I'm trying to, Griffin.

461
00:21:04,980 --> 00:21:06,900
I just need to understand who-

462
00:21:06,900 --> 00:21:07,780
Okay, Griffin.

463
00:21:07,780 --> 00:21:10,900
Answer me this one simple question.

464
00:21:10,900 --> 00:21:11,700
Yeah.

465
00:21:11,700 --> 00:21:14,660
Who might I say the name of these pants allowed to?

466
00:21:14,660 --> 00:21:16,580
No one, just to you.

467
00:21:16,580 --> 00:21:18,820
It's like a fun game for yourself.

468
00:21:18,820 --> 00:21:20,020
Then why not just like, Doug?

469
00:21:20,580 --> 00:21:21,700
These pants are Doug.

470
00:21:22,900 --> 00:21:23,620
If that's funny to you, I guess.

471
00:21:23,620 --> 00:21:25,140
I'm gonna put on Doug.

472
00:21:25,140 --> 00:21:25,700
If that's funny to you-

473
00:21:25,700 --> 00:21:27,700
I put my legs inside Doug.

474
00:21:27,700 --> 00:21:29,300
See, now it's getting better.

475
00:21:29,300 --> 00:21:30,820
Doug's a little worse for wear.

476
00:21:30,820 --> 00:21:32,660
Doug got some sauce on Doug.

477
00:21:32,660 --> 00:21:38,020
Got some Doug, now your name is Rip Meswell.

478
00:21:38,020 --> 00:21:39,780
Tom Longstrand.

479
00:21:42,340 --> 00:21:44,580
I'll be honest, I'll part the curtain a little bit here.

480
00:21:45,380 --> 00:21:48,100
I did include this question just because I wanted to put up

481
00:21:48,100 --> 00:21:50,420
these amazing names from Dolores and the Prune.

482
00:21:50,420 --> 00:21:52,820
Rip Meswell, Tom Longstrand, and Basil Pistowski.

483
00:21:53,380 --> 00:21:55,460
Basil Pistowski is my favorite.

484
00:21:55,460 --> 00:21:56,180
It's very good.

485
00:21:56,180 --> 00:21:58,580
And I thought maybe we could get in there and play along.

486
00:21:58,580 --> 00:22:00,660
But apparently you boys don't want to play my new game

487
00:22:00,660 --> 00:22:01,620
that I came up with for you.

488
00:22:01,620 --> 00:22:03,300
I just, Griffin, I don't-

489
00:22:03,300 --> 00:22:04,340
No, it's fine.

490
00:22:04,340 --> 00:22:05,140
I just don't know.

491
00:22:05,940 --> 00:22:07,140
I just don't know.

492
00:22:07,140 --> 00:22:07,620
It's fine.

493
00:22:08,340 --> 00:22:09,300
How about a different one?

494
00:22:09,300 --> 00:22:10,980
We'll get you guys back in your comfort zone.

495
00:22:11,540 --> 00:22:12,020
Okay.

496
00:22:12,020 --> 00:22:14,340
This one was sent in by a lot of folks.

497
00:22:14,340 --> 00:22:15,380
Well, two folks.

498
00:22:15,380 --> 00:22:17,700
Nicholas Potter and Christian Ang with Syntheson.

499
00:22:17,700 --> 00:22:18,260
Thank you.

500
00:22:18,260 --> 00:22:20,020
It's from Yahoo Answers user Justin.

501
00:22:20,020 --> 00:22:20,420
Uh oh.

502
00:22:22,020 --> 00:22:22,580
Not me.

503
00:22:22,580 --> 00:22:26,260
Justin started his account on Christmas Day

504
00:22:26,260 --> 00:22:28,020
and put this one up on Christmas Day.

505
00:22:28,020 --> 00:22:28,740
Thank you, Justin.

506
00:22:28,740 --> 00:22:34,980
Justin asks, do dogs know they are dogs?

507
00:22:36,180 --> 00:22:36,820
Oh shit.

508
00:22:37,460 --> 00:22:37,860
Yeah.

509
00:22:38,500 --> 00:22:40,420
So I think now you'll play.

510
00:22:40,420 --> 00:22:41,860
Now you'll play with me.

511
00:22:41,860 --> 00:22:42,420
Because I think if-

512
00:22:42,420 --> 00:22:44,420
Do dogs know they are dogs?

513
00:22:44,420 --> 00:22:46,500
You think about this and you think who gives a shit,

514
00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:49,700
but then you also think about Marmaduke,

515
00:22:49,700 --> 00:22:51,620
the dog who thinks he's a person.

516
00:22:53,300 --> 00:22:56,100
So if he exists,

517
00:22:56,100 --> 00:22:58,740
he exists?

518
00:22:58,740 --> 00:22:59,140
Okay.

519
00:22:59,140 --> 00:23:01,380
Let's establish this baseline just for those people

520
00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:03,460
screaming at your podcast player,

521
00:23:03,460 --> 00:23:04,980
your Victrola or whatever.

522
00:23:06,260 --> 00:23:09,540
I think that dogs very clearly can see themselves

523
00:23:09,540 --> 00:23:11,700
and other dogs and humans and be like,

524
00:23:11,700 --> 00:23:12,660
we're definitely,

525
00:23:13,300 --> 00:23:14,820
there's something different here.

526
00:23:14,820 --> 00:23:17,460
The question for me at least is,

527
00:23:17,460 --> 00:23:19,380
do they register like,

528
00:23:19,380 --> 00:23:21,060
well, those people own us.

529
00:23:21,780 --> 00:23:23,460
We are their pets.

530
00:23:23,460 --> 00:23:26,020
So they are definitely above.

531
00:23:26,020 --> 00:23:27,140
I don't know if they go that far,

532
00:23:27,140 --> 00:23:31,700
but I do think they regard us as like the Tallstriders

533
00:23:31,700 --> 00:23:32,900
and the food god,

534
00:23:34,100 --> 00:23:37,700
you know, who reigns their benevolence down upon us.

535
00:23:38,980 --> 00:23:43,860
I feel like dogs know other dogs are dogs.

536
00:23:43,860 --> 00:23:44,260
Yeah.

537
00:23:44,260 --> 00:23:46,340
But they kind of feel bad for those guys.

538
00:23:46,340 --> 00:23:47,380
Oh, I see.

539
00:23:47,380 --> 00:23:50,100
Look at all those guys that are owned by people

540
00:23:50,100 --> 00:23:52,340
and man, that must be a rough putt for them.

541
00:23:52,340 --> 00:23:53,380
I feel bad for dogs.

542
00:23:53,380 --> 00:23:54,660
I don't feel like dogs.

543
00:23:54,660 --> 00:24:00,500
Dogs probably see themselves as small humans on four legs

544
00:24:00,500 --> 00:24:02,340
and then they see other dogs as dogs.

545
00:24:02,340 --> 00:24:04,020
Like there's an air of superiority.

546
00:24:04,020 --> 00:24:04,740
I feel like.

547
00:24:04,740 --> 00:24:05,540
Really?

548
00:24:05,540 --> 00:24:07,860
All dogs are kind of up their own butts a little bit.

549
00:24:08,420 --> 00:24:09,220
A little bit.

550
00:24:09,220 --> 00:24:10,260
Well, that would make a lot of sense.

551
00:24:10,260 --> 00:24:12,660
They are always trying to get up their own butts.

552
00:24:13,220 --> 00:24:14,580
Yeah, that would explain it.

553
00:24:15,860 --> 00:24:16,820
You'd think that they,

554
00:24:18,340 --> 00:24:19,780
this is a tough one.

555
00:24:19,780 --> 00:24:21,140
Do you think they'd be bummed out

556
00:24:21,140 --> 00:24:23,460
or is this just the world that they know?

557
00:24:23,460 --> 00:24:25,060
What do you think they think of cats?

558
00:24:25,940 --> 00:24:28,020
Yeah, I mean, now we're really getting into it.

559
00:24:29,060 --> 00:24:33,220
Like, I think we can all look at a cat that lives in the house with them.

560
00:24:33,220 --> 00:24:34,420
Is the cat like,

561
00:24:34,420 --> 00:24:37,380
yeah, me and the other humans just putting up with this thing.

562
00:24:37,940 --> 00:24:43,540
I think we can all agree that they do look at us as giant gods,

563
00:24:44,420 --> 00:24:47,860
as giant, like giant powerful figures.

564
00:24:47,860 --> 00:24:48,580
You know what I mean?

565
00:24:48,580 --> 00:24:51,060
Like they worship, they worship us unto a god.

566
00:24:51,620 --> 00:24:52,660
That's all Striders.

567
00:24:52,660 --> 00:24:53,940
I actually think Griffin,

568
00:24:53,940 --> 00:24:55,780
you have really touched a nerve for me

569
00:24:55,780 --> 00:24:57,940
because this is my problem with raccoons

570
00:24:57,940 --> 00:24:59,700
is I spend so much time with dogs.

571
00:24:59,700 --> 00:25:00,900
Finally, we're getting to the heart of it.

572
00:25:00,900 --> 00:25:02,740
I know, let's really get down to it.

573
00:25:02,740 --> 00:25:04,500
I spend so much time with dogs

574
00:25:04,500 --> 00:25:08,740
who like very clearly recognize that I am a superior being.

575
00:25:08,740 --> 00:25:10,580
And then there's like a raccoon in my garbage

576
00:25:10,580 --> 00:25:11,540
and I'm like, blah.

577
00:25:11,540 --> 00:25:13,220
And it looks at me like, fuck you.

578
00:25:13,220 --> 00:25:14,420
And just keeps doing what it's doing.

579
00:25:14,420 --> 00:25:17,380
I'm like, no, this is not how this is supposed to go.

580
00:25:17,380 --> 00:25:19,060
And raccoons know they're raccoons, right?

581
00:25:19,060 --> 00:25:21,700
But raccoons don't recognize my divinity is what I'm saying.

582
00:25:21,700 --> 00:25:22,500
Right, exactly.

583
00:25:22,500 --> 00:25:22,980
So-

584
00:25:22,980 --> 00:25:24,020
Yes, that's a good point.

585
00:25:24,020 --> 00:25:25,940
I think horses are, I think equally,

586
00:25:25,940 --> 00:25:27,700
I think horses are just ambivalent, right?

587
00:25:27,700 --> 00:25:28,980
Like horses know they're horses

588
00:25:28,980 --> 00:25:30,740
and I think they're one of the few animals

589
00:25:30,740 --> 00:25:32,900
that are like, yeah, I'm a fucking horse.

590
00:25:32,900 --> 00:25:34,340
Check, guess what?

591
00:25:34,340 --> 00:25:35,620
That I just told you.

592
00:25:35,620 --> 00:25:38,100
So, and I think that they're totally fine with it.

593
00:25:38,100 --> 00:25:40,500
And I don't even think they would refer,

594
00:25:40,500 --> 00:25:42,500
I don't think they would think of us as gods at all.

595
00:25:42,500 --> 00:25:43,780
I think, cause they're taller than us

596
00:25:43,780 --> 00:25:46,420
and they have like way more legs, like twice as many.

597
00:25:46,420 --> 00:25:48,900
So shoot.

598
00:25:48,900 --> 00:25:50,180
I think when we ride a horse,

599
00:25:50,180 --> 00:25:53,220
I think the horse is like, what a cool favor I'm doing.

600
00:25:53,220 --> 00:25:55,860
What about when a dog sees you on a horse?

601
00:25:56,500 --> 00:25:58,260
Now that's probably like,

602
00:25:58,260 --> 00:26:00,820
I don't know why all dogs don't just instinctively shit

603
00:26:00,820 --> 00:26:01,540
when they see that.

604
00:26:02,340 --> 00:26:04,180
Like, what do we even do now?

605
00:26:04,180 --> 00:26:06,900
The one thing I had on them was I had four legs

606
00:26:06,900 --> 00:26:08,980
and now they have six.

607
00:26:08,980 --> 00:26:11,460
This would be essentially like seeing

608
00:26:11,460 --> 00:26:19,140
like God giving like a bigger God a piggyback ride somehow.

609
00:26:19,140 --> 00:26:21,460
Like, I don't even understand how that visual would pan out.

610
00:26:21,460 --> 00:26:23,460
I bet the harder thing for dogs

611
00:26:23,460 --> 00:26:25,860
is when they see people get off a horse.

612
00:26:25,860 --> 00:26:27,220
Like, no, what are you doing?

613
00:26:27,220 --> 00:26:29,300
You just figured, no, what are you?

614
00:26:29,300 --> 00:26:30,420
Are you crazy?

615
00:26:30,420 --> 00:26:31,380
Get back on there.

616
00:26:31,940 --> 00:26:32,740
What are you doing?

617
00:26:32,740 --> 00:26:34,020
Why would you ever get off?

618
00:26:34,020 --> 00:26:35,220
Do you think that when animals,

619
00:26:36,100 --> 00:26:38,420
we human beings have made such a big deal

620
00:26:38,420 --> 00:26:41,380
out of animal pairings and like weird animal pairings.

621
00:26:41,380 --> 00:26:44,500
But I guarantee that like most animals are just like,

622
00:26:44,500 --> 00:26:46,260
yep, you, me, yep.

623
00:26:46,260 --> 00:26:48,100
Like horse is just a bigger dog.

624
00:26:48,100 --> 00:26:49,140
Dogs are just smaller horses.

625
00:26:49,140 --> 00:26:51,700
Travis, are you sure you haven't seen Zootopia?

626
00:26:54,900 --> 00:26:55,780
You got the message.

627
00:26:55,780 --> 00:26:56,660
You got it, dude.

628
00:26:56,660 --> 00:26:58,180
Like you've got, it's a great,

629
00:26:58,180 --> 00:26:58,980
you should watch it

630
00:26:58,980 --> 00:27:01,140
because you've already got it's good message in your heart.

631
00:27:02,020 --> 00:27:03,060
And I guess I don't need it.

632
00:27:04,660 --> 00:27:05,940
That's how I look at movies.

633
00:27:05,940 --> 00:27:07,940
Do I already know that that thing is bad?

634
00:27:07,940 --> 00:27:09,300
I don't need that movie.

635
00:27:09,300 --> 00:27:10,020
I've got it.

636
00:27:10,020 --> 00:27:11,540
I already know to guard the galaxy.

637
00:27:11,540 --> 00:27:12,340
Thank you very much.

638
00:27:13,220 --> 00:27:17,380
I have a new segment on the show.

639
00:27:17,380 --> 00:27:19,140
Is it just another question or is it like a new?

640
00:27:19,780 --> 00:27:21,620
No, it's a new segment I invented.

641
00:27:21,620 --> 00:27:24,180
It's called Guy Another Day.

642
00:27:24,180 --> 00:27:25,780
And it's a Guy Fieri update.

643
00:27:25,780 --> 00:27:27,060
Just like checking in on Guy.

644
00:27:27,700 --> 00:27:30,020
Guy Fieri, see what he's into.

645
00:27:30,020 --> 00:27:30,580
All right.

646
00:27:30,580 --> 00:27:33,380
Wait, like minute by minute, like right now, what is he doing?

647
00:27:33,380 --> 00:27:35,140
No, just like when he does something notable.

648
00:27:36,020 --> 00:27:36,420
Okay.

649
00:27:36,420 --> 00:27:41,380
My wife sent me a quote from a real interview

650
00:27:41,380 --> 00:27:44,580
that Guy Fieri did with a vice property called Munchies.

651
00:27:45,460 --> 00:27:48,980
And they asked him where Flavortown was.

652
00:27:50,260 --> 00:27:51,300
Have you guys seen this?

653
00:27:51,300 --> 00:27:54,340
No, but I would really like to make guesses as to his answer.

654
00:27:54,340 --> 00:27:58,740
Just fucking hold on for literally,

655
00:27:58,740 --> 00:28:00,420
probably the quote of your life.

656
00:28:00,420 --> 00:28:00,900
Oh my God.

657
00:28:01,940 --> 00:28:03,860
I want this to be my Yuletide.

658
00:28:03,860 --> 00:28:06,740
Okay, here we go.

659
00:28:06,740 --> 00:28:08,500
On camera, I once said,

660
00:28:08,500 --> 00:28:11,380
this pizza looks like a manhole cover in Flavortown.

661
00:28:11,940 --> 00:28:12,900
I'm sorry.

662
00:28:12,900 --> 00:28:14,740
I know that's not the funny part of the quote,

663
00:28:14,740 --> 00:28:16,420
but I hadn't heard that one before.

664
00:28:17,220 --> 00:28:19,860
Willy Wonka had a chocolate stream, you know?

665
00:28:20,660 --> 00:28:23,620
So it's taking these iconic food items,

666
00:28:23,620 --> 00:28:26,580
these iconic food moments and giving them a home.

667
00:28:27,380 --> 00:28:28,820
They all live in Flavortown.

668
00:28:29,780 --> 00:28:31,700
It's like one of those things in the matrix.

669
00:28:31,700 --> 00:28:34,660
You can only get down with Flavortown

670
00:28:34,660 --> 00:28:36,180
if you believe in Flavortown.

671
00:28:37,060 --> 00:28:38,580
I have people walk up to me and say,

672
00:28:38,580 --> 00:28:40,900
hey, I'm a citizen of Flavortown.

673
00:28:41,700 --> 00:28:43,140
I have people that want to pledge

674
00:28:43,140 --> 00:28:45,300
to be a city council member of Flavortown

675
00:28:45,940 --> 00:28:47,620
or the mechanic.

676
00:28:48,340 --> 00:28:49,380
It doesn't stop.

677
00:28:49,380 --> 00:28:51,860
Their names are Justin, Travis, and Griffin McElroy.

678
00:28:51,860 --> 00:28:53,140
They email me every week.

679
00:28:54,020 --> 00:28:56,180
What would be the airline of Flavortown?

680
00:28:56,820 --> 00:28:58,100
Sausage Airlines?

681
00:28:58,100 --> 00:29:00,340
Wait, I'm reading the fucking quote.

682
00:29:00,340 --> 00:29:03,460
He, within his own statement about Flavortown,

683
00:29:03,460 --> 00:29:07,700
began to pose his own questions to flesh out the universe.

684
00:29:08,420 --> 00:29:10,420
What would be the airline of Flavortown?

685
00:29:10,420 --> 00:29:12,260
What would be the titles of the Star Wars movies

686
00:29:12,260 --> 00:29:13,220
in Flavortown?

687
00:29:14,100 --> 00:29:15,060
Sausage Airlines?

688
00:29:15,780 --> 00:29:16,740
It just doesn't stop.

689
00:29:17,700 --> 00:29:20,340
I just said it and then people heard it.

690
00:29:20,340 --> 00:29:23,220
Goes all the way to the top.

691
00:29:23,220 --> 00:29:25,780
Here's the fucking cherry on this bad boy.

692
00:29:25,780 --> 00:29:29,460
Of course, there's no Flavortown unless you believe in it.

693
00:29:29,460 --> 00:29:32,340
Oh my God, you scared me so bad because of course I do.

694
00:29:32,340 --> 00:29:35,060
You scared me fucking really, really bad for a second there, guy.

695
00:29:35,060 --> 00:29:37,300
What do you think, as long as we're going down

696
00:29:37,300 --> 00:29:39,380
this hypothetical road, Mr. Fieri,

697
00:29:40,020 --> 00:29:45,140
what do you think mayoral elections are like in Flavortown?

698
00:29:45,140 --> 00:29:47,620
Do you think it's based on who's most flavorful,

699
00:29:47,620 --> 00:29:50,740
who can bring, protect the most flavor,

700
00:29:50,740 --> 00:29:52,660
who can bring the most flavor from outside?

701
00:29:52,660 --> 00:29:54,900
Is it like I've traveled afar

702
00:29:54,900 --> 00:29:57,300
and I've brought you new flavors to Flavortown

703
00:29:57,300 --> 00:30:00,180
or it's like Pizza the Hut, the mayor of Flavortown?

704
00:30:00,180 --> 00:30:04,500
I think there's an electoral college system

705
00:30:04,500 --> 00:30:06,340
just on a very local, hyper-local level

706
00:30:06,980 --> 00:30:10,020
and then I think that results in two candidates

707
00:30:10,020 --> 00:30:12,260
and then they have a buffalo wing eating contest.

708
00:30:13,620 --> 00:30:20,020
Do you think, what role does Mr. Fieri play in politics

709
00:30:20,020 --> 00:30:21,220
and the running of Flavortown?

710
00:30:21,220 --> 00:30:22,100
Doesn't, doesn't, doesn't.

711
00:30:22,100 --> 00:30:22,740
Are you fucking kidding me?

712
00:30:22,740 --> 00:30:25,780
Guy Fieri wandered into Flavortown

713
00:30:25,780 --> 00:30:27,700
as one might wander into Narnia

714
00:30:27,700 --> 00:30:28,980
and discovered it's dark secret.

715
00:30:28,980 --> 00:30:33,380
He was transformed by a satyr.

716
00:30:34,900 --> 00:30:35,700
Interesting.

717
00:30:35,700 --> 00:30:40,580
And then he returned to us through his magic pizza oven

718
00:30:40,580 --> 00:30:43,940
he climbed out of and he, somebody was like,

719
00:30:43,940 --> 00:30:47,700
what the fuck happened to your hair and face and body?

720
00:30:47,700 --> 00:30:50,260
And he was like, I don't know, it got wild over there.

721
00:30:50,260 --> 00:30:52,900
These sunglasses are fused to the back of my head.

722
00:30:52,900 --> 00:30:53,460
Yeah, and then.

723
00:30:53,460 --> 00:30:55,940
They're hot, those are covering the eyes that he uses

724
00:30:55,940 --> 00:30:59,700
to watch his back constantly in case Flavortown comes for him

725
00:30:59,700 --> 00:31:01,940
because they do send, they're called reclaimers

726
00:31:02,580 --> 00:31:05,060
and what they do is they escape,

727
00:31:05,060 --> 00:31:08,100
they are given permission to walk in our world

728
00:31:08,100 --> 00:31:12,180
and if you speak of Flavortown, then they're hunting you.

729
00:31:12,180 --> 00:31:13,460
They're basically hunting people

730
00:31:14,100 --> 00:31:17,220
who can let their secret be known.

731
00:31:17,220 --> 00:31:19,140
But then Jason, why does Mr. Fieri,

732
00:31:19,940 --> 00:31:21,700
like why does he draw their wrath?

733
00:31:21,700 --> 00:31:23,540
He could just stay quiet about Flavortown.

734
00:31:23,540 --> 00:31:24,980
Oh, because he stole their fucking secrets.

735
00:31:26,020 --> 00:31:29,460
And also he's very good with his spark lance.

736
00:31:29,460 --> 00:31:32,100
That's one of the weapons that he took from Flavortown

737
00:31:32,100 --> 00:31:36,580
from the armory and when the reclaimers come for Guy Fieri,

738
00:31:37,300 --> 00:31:39,940
he uses the spark lance that he stole from Flavortown

739
00:31:39,940 --> 00:31:40,820
to defend himself.

740
00:31:41,940 --> 00:31:44,980
And that's why he must always be on the move,

741
00:31:44,980 --> 00:31:47,940
moving from diner to drive in to dive.

742
00:31:47,940 --> 00:31:50,260
Never stopping, never sleeping.

743
00:31:50,260 --> 00:31:52,580
That's why they play the sad, incredible Hulk music

744
00:31:52,580 --> 00:31:54,740
at the end of every episode of Dive, Drives and Dives

745
00:31:54,740 --> 00:31:56,260
because he's on the way.

746
00:31:56,260 --> 00:31:57,940
He's gotta keep on the move

747
00:31:57,940 --> 00:31:59,700
because they're always looking for it.

748
00:31:59,700 --> 00:32:00,500
This does make sense

749
00:32:00,500 --> 00:32:04,500
because I actually went to a restaurant not two days ago

750
00:32:04,500 --> 00:32:07,300
that had one of those like guy's been here panels

751
00:32:07,940 --> 00:32:09,380
and I always thought that was like,

752
00:32:09,380 --> 00:32:10,660
because we're on the show and now I'm thinking

753
00:32:10,660 --> 00:32:12,500
maybe it's like a memorial plaque

754
00:32:12,500 --> 00:32:14,420
because like he finished filming

755
00:32:14,420 --> 00:32:17,140
and then bought off like four reclaimers

756
00:32:17,140 --> 00:32:18,900
saved all of our lives.

757
00:32:18,900 --> 00:32:22,660
Yeah, if they see, if you ever see one of those plaques

758
00:32:23,220 --> 00:32:25,300
just to stay near it for a while

759
00:32:25,300 --> 00:32:27,220
and eventually you'll see someone come in

760
00:32:27,220 --> 00:32:30,500
that looks like a predator made out of fettuccine Alfredo

761
00:32:30,500 --> 00:32:31,620
and that's a reclaimer.

762
00:32:31,620 --> 00:32:33,940
That's what a reclaimer is.

763
00:32:33,940 --> 00:32:34,500
It's just-

764
00:32:34,500 --> 00:32:35,940
Sorry, a fettitor?

765
00:32:35,940 --> 00:32:37,860
No, no, no, no, no.

766
00:32:37,860 --> 00:32:39,780
Maybe it's made of feta, would that be better?

767
00:32:40,340 --> 00:32:41,220
It's not really.

768
00:32:41,940 --> 00:32:45,140
It's just Guy and his hot rod and his spark lance

769
00:32:45,140 --> 00:32:46,660
just driving from place to place

770
00:32:46,660 --> 00:32:49,460
just trying to find the secret that's gonna get

771
00:32:49,460 --> 00:32:52,500
the Flavortown reclaimers off of his back

772
00:32:52,500 --> 00:32:54,900
and really the last Final Fantasy game

773
00:32:54,900 --> 00:32:57,220
was loosely based off of Guy Fieri's story

774
00:32:58,420 --> 00:32:59,780
it's kind of like a cool crossover.

775
00:32:59,780 --> 00:33:01,540
Here's what the history books don't tell you.

776
00:33:02,180 --> 00:33:05,300
There was actually a time at which Flavortown

777
00:33:05,300 --> 00:33:07,540
and our world were one.

778
00:33:07,540 --> 00:33:08,500
Interesting.

779
00:33:08,500 --> 00:33:09,780
And they actually were torn apart

780
00:33:09,780 --> 00:33:12,980
though there is a small like Venn diagram overlap

781
00:33:12,980 --> 00:33:15,780
in the pizza oven that Mr. Fieri uses to travel

782
00:33:15,780 --> 00:33:17,380
betwixt the two planes.

783
00:33:17,380 --> 00:33:22,180
Now Mr. Fieri is trying to draw them back into overlap.

784
00:33:22,180 --> 00:33:24,900
That world was called the personal Pangea, right?

785
00:33:24,900 --> 00:33:25,780
Correct.

786
00:33:25,780 --> 00:33:28,740
And so Mr. Fieri is trying to pull the two worlds

787
00:33:28,740 --> 00:33:29,940
back into alignment.

788
00:33:30,500 --> 00:33:33,380
But now the government of Flavortown

789
00:33:34,020 --> 00:33:35,380
realizes that if that happens

790
00:33:35,380 --> 00:33:38,900
they will lose all the control over their delicious citizens

791
00:33:38,900 --> 00:33:42,580
that they've come to rely on and really bask in.

792
00:33:42,580 --> 00:33:44,740
So they're trying to stop the convergence,

793
00:33:44,740 --> 00:33:46,180
the flavor convergence.

794
00:33:46,180 --> 00:33:47,460
The flavor singularity,

795
00:33:47,460 --> 00:33:51,460
because if he's unsuccessful it's gonna happen

796
00:33:51,460 --> 00:33:53,060
and we're gonna get like a shot

797
00:33:53,060 --> 00:33:56,820
of like an eight-year-old in Iowa or something

798
00:33:56,820 --> 00:34:01,460
and she bites into a crisp, a honey crisp apple

799
00:34:01,460 --> 00:34:04,100
and just fucking pizza sauce spills out of it.

800
00:34:04,100 --> 00:34:05,940
She's like, mama, something's wrong.

801
00:34:06,500 --> 00:34:07,700
And then you look up into the sky

802
00:34:07,700 --> 00:34:09,860
and it's just noodles, zesty noodles falling out.

803
00:34:09,860 --> 00:34:12,180
Well, that's the thing is like right now

804
00:34:12,180 --> 00:34:16,740
everything you taste is maybe 1% of what the actual flavor is.

805
00:34:16,740 --> 00:34:18,100
You would die.

806
00:34:18,100 --> 00:34:21,060
If you got a fucking unfiltered Flavortown

807
00:34:21,060 --> 00:34:21,780
you would be destroyed.

808
00:34:21,780 --> 00:34:23,380
This is like the giver, right?

809
00:34:24,100 --> 00:34:26,500
Only Mr. Fieri remembers flavor

810
00:34:27,060 --> 00:34:28,980
and he has to tell us about it

811
00:34:28,980 --> 00:34:31,460
because flavor has been removed from our lives.

812
00:34:31,460 --> 00:34:33,300
But if this convergence happens

813
00:34:33,300 --> 00:34:36,660
the flood of flavor would knock your tongue

814
00:34:37,300 --> 00:34:38,660
out the back of your head.

815
00:34:38,660 --> 00:34:39,140
Yeah.

816
00:34:39,140 --> 00:34:40,820
And I'm not speaking metaphorically here.

817
00:34:40,820 --> 00:34:43,060
Yeah, it would knock your tongue.

818
00:34:43,860 --> 00:34:46,980
The secret is, and the thing that they're really trying

819
00:34:46,980 --> 00:34:49,060
to keep him from is there is a tower

820
00:34:49,700 --> 00:34:52,740
that connects our world to Flavortown.

821
00:34:52,740 --> 00:34:54,900
And in order to get to, you have to follow,

822
00:34:54,900 --> 00:34:56,660
they call them cream beams.

823
00:34:56,660 --> 00:34:59,300
They're beams made of different cream sauces.

824
00:34:59,940 --> 00:35:03,540
And you can follow them to the tower that unites.

825
00:35:04,820 --> 00:35:07,620
And the man who controls it all is the sorcerer.

826
00:35:07,620 --> 00:35:11,380
And the sorcerer defends the cream beams

827
00:35:11,380 --> 00:35:14,660
but he also tries to keep interlopers out.

828
00:35:15,780 --> 00:35:17,780
So he has to sneak past the sorcerer

829
00:35:17,780 --> 00:35:20,020
to get into Flavortown every time.

830
00:35:20,020 --> 00:35:22,660
It's truly a miraculous tale

831
00:35:22,660 --> 00:35:24,500
when you really sit down and think about it.

832
00:35:24,500 --> 00:35:25,700
If I can just stop for a second

833
00:35:25,700 --> 00:35:26,820
because we always forget to do this.

834
00:35:26,820 --> 00:35:28,500
Fucking TM, TM, TM, TM.

835
00:35:28,500 --> 00:35:29,860
Well, no, hold on, sorry.

836
00:35:29,860 --> 00:35:31,780
We can't TM Guy Fieri.

837
00:35:31,780 --> 00:35:32,820
I'm sorry, fellas.

838
00:35:32,820 --> 00:35:34,340
No, we can't do that.

839
00:35:34,340 --> 00:35:35,780
Okay, but it's fair use.

840
00:35:35,780 --> 00:35:40,660
TM, Big Giant Head LLC, TM, us, don't steal this one.

841
00:35:40,660 --> 00:35:43,460
This one's got cinematic potential.

842
00:35:43,460 --> 00:35:44,900
This one's a movie.

843
00:35:44,900 --> 00:35:46,660
This one's our money maker.

844
00:35:46,660 --> 00:35:48,580
This is the one we can finally retire on.

845
00:35:48,580 --> 00:35:51,780
Can we make a movie about the sorcerer

846
00:35:51,780 --> 00:35:53,380
who controls the all pillar

847
00:35:53,380 --> 00:35:55,780
that connects our world to Flavortown

848
00:35:55,780 --> 00:35:59,220
and our quartet across the cream beams

849
00:36:00,500 --> 00:36:02,740
without including Mr. Fieri at all?

850
00:36:02,740 --> 00:36:04,820
Because I don't actually know that that would be a good hang.

851
00:36:04,820 --> 00:36:06,900
I feel like the story is bigger than him at this point.

852
00:36:06,900 --> 00:36:10,900
Yeah, I feel like if he won't get on board, somebody will.

853
00:36:10,900 --> 00:36:13,460
Well, name our main character Guy Fieri.

854
00:36:14,340 --> 00:36:15,300
Oh, that's good.

855
00:36:17,460 --> 00:36:19,860
Listen, if we're gonna fund this film,

856
00:36:19,860 --> 00:36:22,020
we're gonna need some outside investment

857
00:36:22,020 --> 00:36:24,820
and just to get that kick started,

858
00:36:24,820 --> 00:36:26,660
let's head on over to the Money Zone.

859
00:36:26,660 --> 00:36:39,060
Do you want to shave your goatee?

860
00:36:39,060 --> 00:36:40,500
Sure, we all do.

861
00:36:40,500 --> 00:36:44,500
Hi, I'm Travis McElroy speaking specifically to Guy Fieri now.

862
00:36:47,140 --> 00:36:48,980
This week we're sponsored by Harry's.

863
00:36:48,980 --> 00:36:52,100
Mr. Fieri, I really think this may be the product for you.

864
00:36:52,100 --> 00:36:54,820
That pesky facial hair, you've tried everything.

865
00:36:54,820 --> 00:36:57,620
You've tried clippers, you've tried hedge trimmers,

866
00:36:57,620 --> 00:37:00,100
you've tried like sheep to eat off your face.

867
00:37:00,100 --> 00:37:02,660
You've used the spark lance, like be honest.

868
00:37:02,660 --> 00:37:04,020
And nothing has worked.

869
00:37:04,020 --> 00:37:06,340
Well, might I recommend Harry's razors?

870
00:37:08,740 --> 00:37:12,420
It's got five German engineer blades, a lubricating strip,

871
00:37:12,420 --> 00:37:14,260
flex hinge for a comfortable glide,

872
00:37:14,260 --> 00:37:16,340
trimmer blade for hard to reach places

873
00:37:16,340 --> 00:37:19,380
like the back of your head where your glasses are fused to

874
00:37:19,380 --> 00:37:21,140
and weighted ergonomic handle.

875
00:37:21,140 --> 00:37:23,540
Harry's started with just two guys, Jeff and Andy,

876
00:37:23,540 --> 00:37:25,780
then they bought a factory with a hundred years

877
00:37:25,780 --> 00:37:27,060
of blade making experience

878
00:37:27,060 --> 00:37:29,060
so they could make their own high quality razors,

879
00:37:29,060 --> 00:37:31,540
sell them online and ship them directly for half the price.

880
00:37:31,540 --> 00:37:33,860
You don't have to go to stores and wait for someone

881
00:37:33,860 --> 00:37:38,260
to unlock a cage and pay $50 for two blades.

882
00:37:38,260 --> 00:37:40,340
Instead, just check it out.

883
00:37:40,340 --> 00:37:42,340
All that stuff I mentioned, the five engineer blades,

884
00:37:42,340 --> 00:37:45,940
the lubricate, all that, that's $2 a blade.

885
00:37:46,660 --> 00:37:48,660
That's such an amazing deal.

886
00:37:48,660 --> 00:37:51,220
And Harry's is so confident in the quality of their blades.

887
00:37:51,220 --> 00:37:55,220
They want you to try their most popular trial set for free.

888
00:37:55,220 --> 00:37:56,980
It comes with a razor handle of your choice,

889
00:37:56,980 --> 00:37:59,060
five blade cartridge and shaving gel.

890
00:37:59,060 --> 00:38:02,260
Free when you sign up, just pay a small fee for shipping.

891
00:38:02,260 --> 00:38:03,940
If you want to redeem that trial offer,

892
00:38:03,940 --> 00:38:10,940
go to harrys.com, H-A-R-R-Y-S.com slash my brother right now.

893
00:38:10,940 --> 00:38:13,780
That's harrys.com slash my brother.

894
00:38:14,740 --> 00:38:15,620
Can I talk about Blue Apron?

895
00:38:15,620 --> 00:38:18,820
Cause it's really, I like it a lot.

896
00:38:18,820 --> 00:38:19,140
Yes.

897
00:38:19,140 --> 00:38:20,340
Nope, I'm just going to do it.

898
00:38:20,340 --> 00:38:22,420
I don't need to bother asking for permission.

899
00:38:22,420 --> 00:38:23,620
Folks, when you eat Blue Apron,

900
00:38:23,620 --> 00:38:26,020
you will think you have stolen the secrets of Flavortown

901
00:38:26,020 --> 00:38:28,020
for yourself, which is ridiculous

902
00:38:28,020 --> 00:38:29,860
because you would almost certainly be destroyed

903
00:38:29,860 --> 00:38:33,780
by the woodland satyrs and the fairy circles.

904
00:38:33,780 --> 00:38:36,260
You would be trapped in their endless dance.

905
00:38:36,260 --> 00:38:40,020
But they are going to send you the most flavorful food

906
00:38:40,020 --> 00:38:41,860
without having to risk this deadly journey,

907
00:38:41,860 --> 00:38:43,940
this deadly voyage.

908
00:38:43,940 --> 00:38:45,860
For less than 10 bucks per person, per meal.

909
00:38:45,860 --> 00:38:48,020
And what they send is seasonal recipes

910
00:38:48,020 --> 00:38:49,860
along with pre-portioned ingredients

911
00:38:49,860 --> 00:38:51,860
that you can use to make delicious home-cooked meals.

912
00:38:51,860 --> 00:38:54,660
Stuff like salmon piccata with orzo and broccoli,

913
00:38:54,660 --> 00:38:56,740
pork chops and miso butter with bok choy

914
00:38:56,740 --> 00:38:58,740
and marinated apple, vegetable chili

915
00:38:58,740 --> 00:39:00,900
and baked sweet potatoes with crispy tortilla strips.

916
00:39:00,900 --> 00:39:03,620
Sometimes these like featured upcoming meals,

917
00:39:03,620 --> 00:39:06,340
really almost every time they are stuff

918
00:39:06,340 --> 00:39:08,100
that we haven't gotten yet.

919
00:39:08,100 --> 00:39:10,180
And so this is like actually an exciting sneak preview

920
00:39:10,180 --> 00:39:12,900
for me, a diehard Blue Apron fan.

921
00:39:12,900 --> 00:39:14,820
A diehard Blue Apron subscriber.

922
00:39:14,820 --> 00:39:16,340
Like, ooh, pork chops and miso butter.

923
00:39:16,340 --> 00:39:17,140
Don't mind if I do.

924
00:39:18,100 --> 00:39:18,820
It's really great.

925
00:39:18,820 --> 00:39:21,860
I've had it going for like almost,

926
00:39:21,860 --> 00:39:23,220
I feel like almost a year now

927
00:39:23,220 --> 00:39:26,900
and I didn't know how to cook very good beforehand.

928
00:39:26,900 --> 00:39:30,100
And now I'm getting pretty good and I love cooking.

929
00:39:30,100 --> 00:39:31,540
And it was like a thing that I never thought

930
00:39:31,540 --> 00:39:32,980
I would sort of get good at.

931
00:39:34,420 --> 00:39:35,780
So it's really great.

932
00:39:35,780 --> 00:39:37,060
And you can check out this week's menu

933
00:39:37,060 --> 00:39:39,140

941
00:39:52,900 --> 00:39:56,180
I got a message for Valley and it's from David.

942
00:39:56,180 --> 00:39:57,780
It says, hey Valley, hello.

943
00:39:58,420 --> 00:40:00,420
I'm talking to you right now Valley.

944
00:40:00,420 --> 00:40:01,860
I am in fact speaking to you

945
00:40:01,860 --> 00:40:03,700
from inside the mouth of a McElroy brother.

946
00:40:04,260 --> 00:40:06,420
It's a disturbing image.

947
00:40:06,420 --> 00:40:08,580
I have to say it feels pretty good in here.

948
00:40:08,580 --> 00:40:11,300
Happy birthday Valley.

949
00:40:11,860 --> 00:40:13,620
I hope you have a good day

950
00:40:13,620 --> 00:40:15,780
and that your tentacles can continue to creep

951
00:40:15,780 --> 00:40:18,020
in all sorts of places over the next year.

952
00:40:18,020 --> 00:40:20,100
You are absolutely amazing.

953
00:40:20,100 --> 00:40:22,180
Well, this goes on to some places.

954
00:40:22,180 --> 00:40:24,260
Yeah, that took my mouth some places.

955
00:40:24,260 --> 00:40:26,100
I don't like the idea that I'm in Tomatown

956
00:40:26,100 --> 00:40:28,020
controlled by in like a meet Dave scenario,

957
00:40:28,020 --> 00:40:29,700
but that's fine.

958
00:40:29,700 --> 00:40:32,740
Happy birthday Valley.

959
00:40:32,740 --> 00:40:34,180
It's a birthday one.

960
00:40:34,180 --> 00:40:35,620
That one was by me, by the way.

961
00:40:35,620 --> 00:40:38,500
No one could, no one made me do that.

962
00:40:38,500 --> 00:40:39,860
I have a message for Daniel

963
00:40:39,860 --> 00:40:41,780
and it's from your older sister Julia

964
00:40:41,780 --> 00:40:45,060
who says happiest birthday to my fourth favorite brother.

965
00:40:45,060 --> 00:40:47,620
Thanks for infecting me with my bim bam mania.

966
00:40:47,620 --> 00:40:50,580
You're one of the smartest and funniest people I know

967
00:40:50,580 --> 00:40:52,180
and you have excellent taste in podcasts,

968
00:40:52,180 --> 00:40:55,300
motorcycles, tattoos, and music.

969
00:40:56,260 --> 00:40:58,340
I don't know why that has a bunch of, yeah.

970
00:40:59,140 --> 00:41:00,260
Only a few more years

971
00:41:00,260 --> 00:41:01,940
until we're in a nursing home together,

972
00:41:01,940 --> 00:41:03,780
day drinking and wearing diapers.

973
00:41:03,780 --> 00:41:04,740
That's the dream.

974
00:41:04,740 --> 00:41:06,260
I love you very much.

975
00:41:06,900 --> 00:41:07,620
You know, Griffin,

976
00:41:07,620 --> 00:41:10,420
you on a very recent episode of Rosebuddies

977
00:41:10,420 --> 00:41:15,060
talked about how like the different jumbotrons

978
00:41:15,060 --> 00:41:18,260
for each show had their own kind of like themes,

979
00:41:18,260 --> 00:41:19,940
you know, and like with the Rosebuddies,

980
00:41:19,940 --> 00:41:21,860
it's like all about love and adventure zone.

981
00:41:21,860 --> 00:41:23,780
It's all about like D&D groups.

982
00:41:23,780 --> 00:41:24,100
Yeah.

983
00:41:24,100 --> 00:41:25,460
And my brother and my brother and me,

984
00:41:25,460 --> 00:41:29,300
we have a recurring like gentle insult thing

985
00:41:29,300 --> 00:41:31,460
that happened like you're my fourth favorite brother

986
00:41:31,460 --> 00:41:32,660
and you have tentacles.

987
00:41:32,660 --> 00:41:34,740
It's good-natured ribbing,

988
00:41:34,740 --> 00:41:40,260
but it's also like psycho sexual control over us

989
00:41:40,260 --> 00:41:42,180
and like the glee that people feel

990
00:41:42,180 --> 00:41:44,340
like I'm making a McElroy say stuff.

991
00:41:45,140 --> 00:41:47,460
It feels good in this soft mouth.

992
00:41:48,900 --> 00:41:49,780
It's very upsetting.

993
00:41:50,500 --> 00:41:51,460
I mean, yeah.

994
00:41:51,460 --> 00:41:52,500
Thank you for your support.

995
00:41:52,500 --> 00:41:53,140
Thank you for your support.

you can go to maximumfun.org forward slash jumbotron.

998
00:41:57,540 --> 00:41:59,300
And then cry because there's nothing.

999
00:41:59,860 --> 00:42:01,140
Yeah, for not this year,

1000
00:42:01,140 --> 00:42:03,700
you can weep and gnash your teeth.

1001
00:42:03,700 --> 00:42:05,380

We've only done one question,

1022
00:42:39,620 --> 00:42:41,220
so I'm gonna do another question.

1023
00:42:41,220 --> 00:42:42,260
Well, what about a Yahoo?

1024
00:42:43,220 --> 00:42:45,060
But we've only done one question

1025
00:42:45,060 --> 00:42:46,660
and you did two Yahoos.

1026
00:42:46,660 --> 00:42:47,460
That's a good point.

1027
00:42:49,780 --> 00:42:52,500
I started dating my longtime friend recently.

1028
00:42:52,500 --> 00:42:54,740
I noticed a horseback riding trophy on his dresser

1029
00:42:54,740 --> 00:42:56,100
and asked him about it.

1030
00:42:56,100 --> 00:42:58,500
He said that as a youth, he did trick riding

1031
00:42:58,500 --> 00:43:01,300
and could even do handstands while the horse was in motion.

1032
00:43:02,740 --> 00:43:05,060
When asked to do a handstand, he refused,

1033
00:43:05,060 --> 00:43:07,380
saying it's easier to do on a horse.

1034
00:43:09,460 --> 00:43:11,700
Brothers, is my new boyfriend a liar?

1035
00:43:11,700 --> 00:43:14,900
How can I get him to back up his claims of sick tricks?

1036
00:43:14,900 --> 00:43:19,620
That's from riding high or hiding lies in Kings County.

1037
00:43:19,620 --> 00:43:20,340
Ah, damn it.

1038
00:43:21,300 --> 00:43:22,180
I got so excited

1039
00:43:22,180 --> 00:43:24,020
because you said you're dating your longtime friend.

1040
00:43:24,020 --> 00:43:26,100
In my mind, I was just like, oh, what a love.

1041
00:43:26,100 --> 00:43:30,900
But then this is a pretty big lie.

1042
00:43:30,900 --> 00:43:32,340
Like this is a pretty major lie.

1043
00:43:32,340 --> 00:43:38,740
And it tells you that this person is willing to lie about,

1044
00:43:38,740 --> 00:43:40,420
and if they'll lie about this,

1045
00:43:40,420 --> 00:43:44,100
they'll lie about literally anything for fun.

1046
00:43:44,100 --> 00:43:47,380
But they do have a trophy.

1047
00:43:50,100 --> 00:43:53,380
Okay, I will not deny the fact

1048
00:43:53,380 --> 00:43:58,500
that it is possible to handstand while riding on a horse.

1049
00:43:58,500 --> 00:44:01,540
I think it's going to require a pretty fucking good jockey

1050
00:44:01,540 --> 00:44:03,860
and a pretty fucking good horse.

1051
00:44:03,860 --> 00:44:10,740
A broad horse that has a real flat-backed literal pommel horse

1052
00:44:10,740 --> 00:44:12,100
is what we're talking about here.

1053
00:44:13,300 --> 00:44:16,500
Is it easier to do that on the ground

1054
00:44:16,500 --> 00:44:20,580
that doesn't have shifting meat and bones inside of it?

1055
00:44:20,580 --> 00:44:23,540
No, no, no, no, no, of course not.

1056
00:44:23,540 --> 00:44:24,100
No, it's-

1057
00:44:24,100 --> 00:44:26,420
Counterpoint, counterpoint, counterpoint, counterpoint.

1058
00:44:26,420 --> 00:44:29,380
This is gonna have to be a fucking pretty good counterpoint.

1059
00:44:29,380 --> 00:44:33,700
Perhaps this boyfriend from birth

1060
00:44:34,500 --> 00:44:37,380
was only trained to handstand on a horse.

1061
00:44:37,380 --> 00:44:40,260
They have never done it on a flat surface before.

1062
00:44:41,860 --> 00:44:47,380
So it's like, maybe he's from a family of fucking trick riders

1063
00:44:47,380 --> 00:44:50,020
because otherwise, how do you accidentally get into it?

1064
00:44:50,020 --> 00:44:53,540
How, if your family is not horse people, do you at like six

1065
00:44:53,540 --> 00:44:58,500
be like, mom, dad, parents, folks, I want a trick ride?

1066
00:44:58,500 --> 00:44:58,740
And your parents are like, okay.

1067
00:44:58,740 --> 00:45:02,180
Travis, I love you and I know this is all for the joke

1068
00:45:02,180 --> 00:45:05,380
and it's a joke show full of goofs and spoofs.

1069
00:45:06,260 --> 00:45:10,820
There's no reality in which the first time you try a handstand

1070
00:45:11,380 --> 00:45:14,420
it's on a horse that simply does not track.

1071
00:45:14,420 --> 00:45:15,460
Cannot be done.

1072
00:45:15,460 --> 00:45:16,180
It cannot be-

1073
00:45:16,180 --> 00:45:17,460
You're right, you're right, you're right.

1074
00:45:17,460 --> 00:45:20,980
A pony, you have to grow up together to establish that trust.

1075
00:45:20,980 --> 00:45:22,340
Thank you, Justin.

1076
00:45:22,340 --> 00:45:23,460
You are right.

1077
00:45:23,460 --> 00:45:26,500
At two years old, you had a new foal.

1078
00:45:26,500 --> 00:45:28,100
You handstand on the foal.

1079
00:45:28,100 --> 00:45:29,380
You grow up together.

1080
00:45:29,380 --> 00:45:30,900
You died and the pony died.

1081
00:45:32,100 --> 00:45:34,340
I think if you try to do a handstand on a pony and you die

1082
00:45:34,340 --> 00:45:36,900
I think the pony is also sort of summarily killed.

1083
00:45:38,340 --> 00:45:40,100
I think the pony's also destroyed.

1084
00:45:40,100 --> 00:45:41,140
You killed my boy.

1085
00:45:41,140 --> 00:45:45,460
You weak back baby horse.

1086
00:45:48,260 --> 00:45:49,380
It's just not true.

1087
00:45:49,380 --> 00:45:51,860
It can't be done, it's not.

1088
00:45:51,860 --> 00:45:54,420
Okay, the two things that bother me the rest of this.

1089
00:45:54,420 --> 00:45:58,100
One, he is objectively lied by saying it's easier on a horse.

1090
00:45:58,100 --> 00:45:59,860
That's a lie.

1091
00:45:59,860 --> 00:46:02,180
Good on you for your lie detector going off.

1092
00:46:02,740 --> 00:46:06,740
As far as proof, there is no reality in which

1093
00:46:06,740 --> 00:46:09,220
if I did a handstand on a horse

1094
00:46:09,220 --> 00:46:12,260
I would not be wearing a shirt that says take your fucking phone out

1095
00:46:12,260 --> 00:46:15,220
and get ready to take a picture of this sick shit I'm about to do.

1096
00:46:15,220 --> 00:46:18,500
Everybody would be ready to take a picture of me

1097
00:46:18,500 --> 00:46:22,020
doing a handstand on a horse if I was about to do that.

1098
00:46:22,580 --> 00:46:23,780
Absolutely.

1099
00:46:23,780 --> 00:46:24,580
There would be pictures.

1100
00:46:24,580 --> 00:46:26,660
Alternate theory, alternate theory I have now.

1101
00:46:28,260 --> 00:46:34,180
This boyfriend is hiding a traumatic handstand horse event similar to-

1102
00:46:34,180 --> 00:46:35,060
They're all traumatic.

1103
00:46:35,060 --> 00:46:40,980
There's been tops four non-traumatic handstand horse activities.

1104
00:46:40,980 --> 00:46:42,580
This is just like in the Kingkiller Chronicles

1105
00:46:42,580 --> 00:46:44,500
when it's like Kvothe doesn't do magic anymore.

1106
00:46:44,500 --> 00:46:46,180
It doesn't play music and we're all like-

1107
00:46:46,180 --> 00:46:47,060
What happened, yeah.

1108
00:46:47,060 --> 00:46:47,940
But why?

1109
00:46:47,940 --> 00:46:49,780
In book three of your relationship,

1110
00:46:49,780 --> 00:46:51,860
book one was longtime friends.

1111
00:46:51,860 --> 00:46:54,180
Book two, boyfriend.

1112
00:46:54,180 --> 00:46:58,500
Book three, in book three of your relationship with this person

1113
00:46:58,500 --> 00:47:00,420
you're going to find out what happened

1114
00:47:00,420 --> 00:47:02,420
and oh, it's going to be so, it's-

1115
00:47:02,420 --> 00:47:04,340
Listen, I don't want to build this up.

1116
00:47:04,340 --> 00:47:06,020
I don't want to give you false hope.

1117
00:47:06,020 --> 00:47:08,420
It's going to be the sickest story you've ever heard.

1118
00:47:08,420 --> 00:47:10,660
It doesn't matter how long it takes book three

1119
00:47:10,660 --> 00:47:12,020
of your relationship to come out.

1120
00:47:13,620 --> 00:47:14,420
Take your time.

1121
00:47:15,300 --> 00:47:17,700
Horse handstand Patrick Rothfuss.

1122
00:47:17,700 --> 00:47:19,380
Take your time and polish it up.

1123
00:47:20,100 --> 00:47:20,980
Get it ready.

1124
00:47:20,980 --> 00:47:22,100
Get it ready for us.

1125
00:47:23,780 --> 00:47:29,700
But it's going to be the fucking sickest shit ever.

1126
00:47:29,700 --> 00:47:34,260
Now, in the meantime, don't press your partner too hard here

1127
00:47:34,260 --> 00:47:36,740
because this third silence is his.

1128
00:47:36,740 --> 00:47:39,300
He'll give you the story when he's ready for it.

1129
00:47:40,580 --> 00:47:44,580
But it's going to be incredible.

1130
00:47:44,580 --> 00:47:45,460
Incredible.

1131
00:47:45,460 --> 00:47:46,820
Do you guys want to yahoo?

1132
00:47:46,820 --> 00:47:47,620
Yes, please.

1133
00:47:47,620 --> 00:47:48,120
Yes.

1134
00:47:49,540 --> 00:47:52,260
This one, well, there's another one that's like-

1135
00:47:52,260 --> 00:47:53,300
Give me a name for a thing.

1136
00:47:53,300 --> 00:47:53,860
But I feel like we-

1137
00:47:53,860 --> 00:47:55,300
Well, we didn't really do that with the jeans

1138
00:47:55,300 --> 00:47:58,020
because you fellas didn't really want to play along

1139
00:47:58,020 --> 00:47:59,060
and play my game.

1140
00:47:59,060 --> 00:47:59,860
Let's just do this one.

1141
00:47:59,860 --> 00:48:01,140
Or maybe I'll do two more.

1142
00:48:01,140 --> 00:48:02,580
This one's from Irham Waisessa.

1143
00:48:02,580 --> 00:48:03,220
Thank you, Irham.

1144
00:48:03,220 --> 00:48:05,140
It's by yahoo answer's user, They Are Anonymous.

1145
00:48:05,140 --> 00:48:07,860
So I'm going to say also Joey.

1146
00:48:07,860 --> 00:48:09,620
Joey is a very curious young man.

1147
00:48:10,420 --> 00:48:14,580
Joey asks, what's a good name for a posh all boys school?

1148
00:48:15,860 --> 00:48:17,140
Pesto pants.

1149
00:48:17,140 --> 00:48:20,500
Travis, God, saucy slacks.

1150
00:48:20,500 --> 00:48:23,140
I fucking can't believe you guys.

1151
00:48:26,660 --> 00:48:28,100
Okay, a good name.

1152
00:48:28,100 --> 00:48:31,460
A good name for a fancy boys school.

1153
00:48:33,380 --> 00:48:35,220
Wait, was it posh or fancy?

1154
00:48:35,220 --> 00:48:36,580
Posh all boys school.

1155
00:48:36,580 --> 00:48:39,220
If you're about to become the headmaster of-

1156
00:48:39,220 --> 00:48:43,060
I think we can all agree that's the dream.

1157
00:48:44,260 --> 00:48:48,100
How about Professor Xavier's school for okay kids?

1158
00:48:52,020 --> 00:48:54,020
And you can go and you can still get the patch.

1159
00:48:54,020 --> 00:49:01,300
And yes, we do have a cool futuristic jet, but just the kids are just kind of okay.

1160
00:49:01,860 --> 00:49:07,860
How about Lord Zachary Quillington's Institute for Refinement and Math?

1161
00:49:07,860 --> 00:49:08,740
Also math.

1162
00:49:08,740 --> 00:49:09,380
Also math.

1163
00:49:09,380 --> 00:49:12,420
Well, maths, if we're going to get fancy on it.

1164
00:49:12,420 --> 00:49:24,420
How about Benedict Cumberbatch's home for sharp faced boys?

1165
00:49:24,420 --> 00:49:24,980
Welcome.

1166
00:49:26,020 --> 00:49:27,780
So glad you could join us.

1167
00:49:27,780 --> 00:49:28,500
Is that him?

1168
00:49:29,060 --> 00:49:30,580
I'm Benedict Cumberbatch.

1169
00:49:33,860 --> 00:49:37,220
You, doughy faced young man, how did you get in?

1170
00:49:38,020 --> 00:49:39,620
Get this dough boy out.

1171
00:49:39,620 --> 00:49:42,260
Round features.

1172
00:49:43,460 --> 00:49:48,100
I shall leave you in the competent hands of my co-teacher, Eddie Redmayne.

1173
00:49:50,500 --> 00:49:54,420
And then Eddie Redmayne just kind of like morphs out of him.

1174
00:49:54,420 --> 00:49:57,780
They just sort of like cellularly divide and then they're-

1175
00:49:59,140 --> 00:50:01,300
And our sister, Tilda Swinton.

1176
00:50:01,300 --> 00:50:02,740
Yes, all of- yeah, excellent.

1177
00:50:03,620 --> 00:50:08,340
Take yourself to Brendan Gleason's school for round boys.

1178
00:50:08,340 --> 00:50:09,300
Round boys.

1179
00:50:15,060 --> 00:50:19,860
That's where you belong, at Brendan's Institute of Ill Repute.

1180
00:50:19,860 --> 00:50:22,100
Though fucking when that dodgeball game happened-

1181
00:50:22,100 --> 00:50:23,620
That's exactly what I was about to say.

1182
00:50:23,620 --> 00:50:25,300
This fucking go-kart race.

1183
00:50:26,100 --> 00:50:26,580
Yes.

1184
00:50:26,580 --> 00:50:31,540
And think of the hilarious, like one of the sharp faced boys gets hit by a ball, ball deflates.

1185
00:50:31,540 --> 00:50:32,900
Ball deflates, hysterical.

1186
00:50:32,900 --> 00:50:33,380
That's good, that's solid.

1187
00:50:35,460 --> 00:50:36,180
Fucking great.

1188
00:50:36,180 --> 00:50:37,460
I don't need- we're done.

1189
00:50:37,460 --> 00:50:39,540
No need to go further into this one.

1190
00:50:39,540 --> 00:50:40,820
Yeah, that's great.

1191
00:50:40,820 --> 00:50:41,620
We answered that.

1192
00:50:41,620 --> 00:50:42,580
We helped that person.

1193
00:50:43,140 --> 00:50:43,940
We helped someone.

1194
00:50:45,940 --> 00:50:50,740
I live in a college dorm and an improv group recently started meeting every night.

1195
00:50:50,740 --> 00:50:52,420
No, that's too much improv.

1196
00:50:52,420 --> 00:50:53,460
That's too much of it.

1197
00:50:53,460 --> 00:50:54,180
It's too much.

1198
00:50:56,020 --> 00:51:00,660
Take it from somebody who tried to do that for three weeks straight, making a TV show.

1199
00:51:00,660 --> 00:51:01,300
It's too much.

1200
00:51:01,300 --> 00:51:02,180
You can't do that much.

1201
00:51:02,180 --> 00:51:03,380
You can't be funny, all of it.

1202
00:51:03,380 --> 00:51:05,620
The problem is their improv is really bad.

1203
00:51:05,620 --> 00:51:10,420
I used to use the common room to cook dinner for myself, but it's hard to focus on cooking the food

1204
00:51:10,420 --> 00:51:14,420
that I need to live while they're literally rolling around the ground in front of me.

1205
00:51:15,220 --> 00:51:18,420
These are people that I need to face in class the next day.

1206
00:51:18,420 --> 00:51:19,380
How can I cope?

1207
00:51:19,940 --> 00:51:22,100
That's from Just Hungry in Baltimore.

1208
00:51:22,100 --> 00:51:24,260
Oh, fucking shit.

1209
00:51:25,300 --> 00:51:26,420
That's a legit problem.

1210
00:51:27,060 --> 00:51:34,420
At what point, if one is constantly doing improv, does that differ from just living your life

1211
00:51:34,420 --> 00:51:36,420
every day?

1212
00:51:36,420 --> 00:51:38,420
Whoa.

1213
00:51:38,420 --> 00:51:39,380
Whoa.

1214
00:51:39,380 --> 00:51:40,340
Wait, what?

1215
00:51:40,340 --> 00:51:40,660
What?

1216
00:51:40,660 --> 00:51:41,620
Well, because like every day-

1217
00:51:41,620 --> 00:51:42,820
That sounded insightful.

1218
00:51:42,820 --> 00:51:44,820
And then my other brain is like-

1219
00:51:44,820 --> 00:51:47,220
Yeah, your left lobe was like, no, no, no, that was dumb.

1220
00:51:47,220 --> 00:51:47,700
No, no, no.

1221
00:51:47,700 --> 00:51:48,900
That didn't make any sense.

1222
00:51:48,900 --> 00:51:54,020
But what I'm saying is if you walk into these people doing this every day and you leave and

1223
00:51:54,020 --> 00:51:59,780
they're still doing it, how do you know that they're doing an event and that this is just

1224
00:51:59,780 --> 00:52:02,180
not the way they've chosen to live their lives?

1225
00:52:02,180 --> 00:52:03,380
It doesn't fucking matter.

1226
00:52:03,380 --> 00:52:06,340
I'm trying to make my spaghetti over here.

1227
00:52:08,900 --> 00:52:15,940
You just bumped into me doing a little skit about how you guys are shoveling coal into

1228
00:52:15,940 --> 00:52:16,580
a train engine.

1229
00:52:16,580 --> 00:52:18,900
Oh, you fucking punched me while you were doing that.

1230
00:52:18,900 --> 00:52:22,820
Why are you doing improv right fucking next to me while I'm trying to live my life?

1231
00:52:22,820 --> 00:52:26,420
You know they're so desperate for inputs and prompts that they're definitely going to

1232
00:52:26,420 --> 00:52:31,140
incorporate, hey, Luigi, pass me the sauce over here.

1233
00:52:31,140 --> 00:52:32,820
I've got to put the pepper in it.

1234
00:52:32,820 --> 00:52:34,820
Like, can you just not?

1235
00:52:34,820 --> 00:52:36,740
Can you please, please?

1236
00:52:36,740 --> 00:52:40,340
Oh, oh, instant ramen again.

1237
00:52:40,340 --> 00:52:41,220
Uh oh.

1238
00:52:41,220 --> 00:52:42,660
I don't know why I'm doing this.

1239
00:52:42,660 --> 00:52:44,500
Michael, you don't need to do that voice right now.

1240
00:52:44,500 --> 00:52:44,980
You're right.

1241
00:52:46,020 --> 00:52:46,500
You're right.

1242
00:52:46,500 --> 00:52:51,540
The problem with cooking your dinner is every night you have to come equipped with a readily

1243
00:52:51,540 --> 00:52:55,620
available place, career, and funny situation.

1244
00:52:55,620 --> 00:52:56,660
Just call it out.

1245
00:52:56,660 --> 00:52:57,620
Anybody, anybody.

1246
00:52:57,620 --> 00:52:58,980
I'm the only one here.

1247
00:52:58,980 --> 00:53:04,900
It's like the weirdest three billy goats, answer me these riddles three, a place, a

1248
00:53:04,900 --> 00:53:06,740
profession, and a food.

1249
00:53:08,020 --> 00:53:09,460
This stinks.

1250
00:53:09,460 --> 00:53:12,260
Maybe this is like their answer to improv anywhere.

1251
00:53:12,260 --> 00:53:16,020
And this is like improv in one specific place forever.

1252
00:53:16,020 --> 00:53:16,980
Improv where you are.

1253
00:53:17,620 --> 00:53:18,100
Here.

1254
00:53:18,100 --> 00:53:18,980
Improv here now.

1255
00:53:18,980 --> 00:53:19,780
Now here.

1256
00:53:19,780 --> 00:53:22,100
Improv where Jim is making spaghetti.

1257
00:53:22,100 --> 00:53:23,060
Improv at Jim.

1258
00:53:24,260 --> 00:53:25,060
Just don't.

1259
00:53:25,060 --> 00:53:28,180
Improv should be, I get uncomfortable with the improv.

1260
00:53:28,180 --> 00:53:28,820
Jim improv.

1261
00:53:28,820 --> 00:53:29,620
Fucking shit.

1262
00:53:29,620 --> 00:53:33,300
I get uncomfortable with the improv everywhere stuff because it's like improv should be a

1263
00:53:33,300 --> 00:53:36,500
thing that I agree to.

1264
00:53:37,220 --> 00:53:40,100
I am going to go to an improv tonight.

1265
00:53:40,100 --> 00:53:42,900
I said while living in Chicago, not so much here in Austin.

1266
00:53:42,900 --> 00:53:45,940
Tonight I will go to an improv and I would go to it.

1267
00:53:45,940 --> 00:53:48,820
It cannot come to me because I'm doing other things right now.

1268
00:53:49,380 --> 00:53:51,220
I don't have time for you improv.

1269
00:53:51,220 --> 00:53:53,140
Oh, time to watch the season finale of Lost.

1270
00:53:53,700 --> 00:53:54,740
Are you sure?

1271
00:53:55,540 --> 00:53:56,420
Ding dong.

1272
00:53:56,420 --> 00:53:59,060
Cuckoo cuckoo.

1273
00:53:59,060 --> 00:53:59,460
Uh oh.

1274
00:53:59,460 --> 00:54:00,740
Somebody feed that duck.

1275
00:54:01,380 --> 00:54:01,940
Stop it.

1276
00:54:02,580 --> 00:54:02,900
Stop.

1277
00:54:02,900 --> 00:54:04,260
I got to know what happens to Sawyer.

1278
00:54:05,860 --> 00:54:06,260
Uh oh.

1279
00:54:06,260 --> 00:54:07,540
My toilet's broke.

1280
00:54:07,540 --> 00:54:08,340
I've got it.

1281
00:54:08,340 --> 00:54:09,380
Don't worry about it.

1282
00:54:11,380 --> 00:54:11,700
Stop.

1283
00:54:11,700 --> 00:54:12,340
He's stabbing me.

1284
00:54:12,340 --> 00:54:13,140
He's stabbing me.

1285
00:54:14,020 --> 00:54:15,540
No, I'm not stabbing you.

1286
00:54:15,540 --> 00:54:18,740
I'm improv.

1287
00:54:19,700 --> 00:54:20,900
Can you not do this?

1288
00:54:20,900 --> 00:54:23,300
I'm in a movie with my kid.

1289
00:54:23,300 --> 00:54:24,820
We're seeing trolls too.

1290
00:54:24,820 --> 00:54:27,540
Can you fucking please not do this in the movies right now?

1291
00:54:28,740 --> 00:54:29,380
Excuse me, sir.

1292
00:54:29,380 --> 00:54:33,140
I'd like to see your ticket or else I'll have to kick you off the train.

1293
00:54:34,180 --> 00:54:34,660
Stop it.

1294
00:54:34,660 --> 00:54:36,100
It's not a train.

1295
00:54:36,100 --> 00:54:36,900
It's not a train.

1296
00:54:36,900 --> 00:54:38,100
I'm at Trolls 2 with my kid.

1297
00:54:39,140 --> 00:54:40,340
Please.

1298
00:54:42,500 --> 00:54:44,660
Oh, you got to take this and turn it to your advantage.

1299
00:54:44,660 --> 00:54:48,020
If you're like, I can't wait to see Trolls 2, but I'm not able to go tonight.

1300
00:54:48,020 --> 00:54:52,180
You know, then you go to the common room and you just shout out like Trolls 2.

1301
00:54:52,900 --> 00:54:53,940
Then they're just like.

1302
00:54:53,940 --> 00:54:54,980
That's good.

1303
00:54:54,980 --> 00:54:57,380
Can you guys do how you think Trolls 2 goes?

1304
00:54:58,500 --> 00:55:01,140
Let me walk you through Trolls 1.

1305
00:55:01,140 --> 00:55:03,860
Okay, so the Bergens have to eat trolls to be happy.

1306
00:55:04,740 --> 00:55:05,380
Get comfortable.

1307
00:55:05,380 --> 00:55:06,660
There's a lot of twists and turns.

1308
00:55:09,300 --> 00:55:10,500
I don't see anybody taking notes.

1309
00:55:12,180 --> 00:55:14,820
Folks, that's going to do it for us on our improv show.

1310
00:55:16,500 --> 00:55:19,540
If you do improv, I hope I didn't upset you just then.

1311
00:55:19,540 --> 00:55:20,180
Never did it.

1312
00:55:20,180 --> 00:55:22,260
Don't quite understand the craft.

1313
00:55:22,260 --> 00:55:28,020
I know it's not all people doing make-believe professions on each other, but.

1314
00:55:28,020 --> 00:55:30,020
Yes, there's heralds involved.

1315
00:55:30,020 --> 00:55:30,900
I know that.

1316
00:55:30,900 --> 00:55:31,940
Yeah, yeah.

1317
00:55:31,940 --> 00:55:32,580
That's part of it.

1318
00:55:34,660 --> 00:55:37,060
Anyway, thank you for listening.

1319
00:55:38,180 --> 00:55:40,180
So we've got a TV show now.

1320
00:55:40,900 --> 00:55:42,820
It's on a service called CISO.

1321
00:55:42,820 --> 00:55:44,260
You can get CISO at CISO.com.

1322
00:55:44,260 --> 00:55:46,740
That's S-E-E-S-O.com.

1323
00:55:47,620 --> 00:55:50,420
They got a free week so you can go check it out and see what you think.

1324
00:55:50,420 --> 00:55:51,700
There's a ton of great stuff on there.

1325
00:55:51,700 --> 00:55:55,460
And I think you're just going to go gaga over it besides our show.

1326
00:55:55,460 --> 00:55:59,460
But in addition to our show, I was going to say, if you've already checked it out,

1327
00:55:59,460 --> 00:56:00,740
and you're like, I watched the show.

1328
00:56:01,780 --> 00:56:09,460
We just put up a deleted scenes and an eight minute blooper reel for the first episode.

1329
00:56:09,460 --> 00:56:11,380
And there's going to be more of that coming.

1330
00:56:11,380 --> 00:56:13,940
So even though all six episodes went up on the same day,

1331
00:56:13,940 --> 00:56:17,140
there's going to be more bonus content coming out periodically.

1332
00:56:17,140 --> 00:56:19,940
Yeah, we're talking like 15 minutes of stuff went up today.

1333
00:56:19,940 --> 00:56:21,780
So there's a lot on there.

1334
00:56:21,780 --> 00:56:26,180
They've got an app you can get on the Roku and Apple Store.

1335
00:56:26,180 --> 00:56:28,260
And you can watch through Amazon Prime.

1336
00:56:28,260 --> 00:56:29,940
And you could subscribe to CISO through that.

1337
00:56:29,940 --> 00:56:31,700
But check it out.

1338
00:56:31,700 --> 00:56:32,580
It's a great service.

1339
00:56:32,580 --> 00:56:37,780
And the feedback to our show has just, everybody's been really, really kind about it.

1340
00:56:37,780 --> 00:56:40,820
And we just really, really appreciate it.

1341
00:56:40,820 --> 00:56:46,260
If it came together at all, by the way, it has only like partially to do with us

1342
00:56:46,260 --> 00:56:49,140
and mainly to do with like the amazing people that we work with,

1343
00:56:49,140 --> 00:56:53,620
like Greg and Jackie, JD, Seth and Alex and New and everybody,

1344
00:56:54,500 --> 00:56:57,140
Steve and everybody who worked on the show.

1345
00:56:57,140 --> 00:56:58,420
So thank you to all of them.

1346
00:56:58,420 --> 00:57:02,420
And thank you to you all for watching it and letting us know what you think.

1347
00:57:03,060 --> 00:57:06,180
I just want to say thank you to everybody for watching it and sharing it with friends.

1348
00:57:06,180 --> 00:57:09,060
We've seen a lot of like listening parties, a lot of people like tweeting it,

1349
00:57:09,060 --> 00:57:12,020
saying like, I sat down with my wife and she's never listened to the show before.

1350
00:57:12,020 --> 00:57:12,900
And she loved it.

1351
00:57:12,900 --> 00:57:18,980
Like that kind of stuff makes me so happy to see like people not only supporting our show,

1352
00:57:18,980 --> 00:57:22,180
but also like supporting other people seeing it.

1353
00:57:24,020 --> 00:57:27,140
It makes me feel very warm and fuzzy inside.

1354
00:57:27,140 --> 00:57:28,100
So thank you very much.

1355
00:57:29,700 --> 00:57:31,300
I want to thank John Roderick in the long winter,

1356
00:57:31,300 --> 00:57:34,340
who used our theme song, It's a Departure, off the album, Putting the Days to Bed,

1357
00:57:34,340 --> 00:57:40,180
which I, boy, I hope you've purchased that album in some way now.

1358
00:57:40,180 --> 00:57:43,940
They've been letting us use it for almost 350 episodes and it's a really good album.

1359
00:57:43,940 --> 00:57:44,900
I think you're really going to dig it.

1360
00:57:45,860 --> 00:57:47,940
We also want to say go check out all the other amazing shows

1361
00:57:47,940 --> 00:57:49,300
on MaximumFun.org.

1362
00:57:49,300 --> 00:57:50,420
There's a ton on there.

1363
00:57:51,780 --> 00:57:54,740
A lot of them we're on, but all of them are great.

1364
00:57:54,740 --> 00:57:56,660
I'm a big fan of every show on the network.

1365
00:57:56,660 --> 00:57:57,940
No exaggeration.

1366
00:57:57,940 --> 00:58:00,420
Coming up is the Max Fun Drive, which we'll tell you all about.

1367
00:58:00,420 --> 00:58:03,860
But if you're new to the show since last March-ish,

1368
00:58:05,140 --> 00:58:08,100
we've got a chance for you coming up to help support this show

1369
00:58:08,100 --> 00:58:09,700
and the other shows on Max Fun that you love.

1370
00:58:09,700 --> 00:58:11,140
So stay tuned for that.

1371
00:58:12,260 --> 00:58:15,780
The important thing is there's going to be a lot of bonus content

1372
00:58:15,780 --> 00:58:17,700
and a lot of new stuff for you to listen to.

1373
00:58:17,700 --> 00:58:19,460
So it's a very exciting time.

1374
00:58:22,100 --> 00:58:22,500
Anything?

1375
00:58:22,500 --> 00:58:24,340
Oh, you can go to McElroyShows.com.

1376
00:58:24,340 --> 00:58:27,220
Also, if you want to check out all the stuff we're involved in.

1377
00:58:28,340 --> 00:58:29,140
I just made it.

1378
00:58:29,140 --> 00:58:30,500
Squarespace is not a sponsor this week,

1379
00:58:30,500 --> 00:58:33,860
but I made my own website in Squarespace over the weekend.

1380
00:58:33,860 --> 00:58:35,460
You did so good, Griffin.

1381
00:58:35,460 --> 00:58:36,820
Thank you, Travis.

1382
00:58:36,820 --> 00:58:37,700
Great website.

1383
00:58:37,700 --> 00:58:42,100
It looks so good that it made me feel like I need to update TravisMcElroy.com.

1384
00:58:42,100 --> 00:58:43,700
GriffinMcElroy.com, for a long time,

1385
00:58:43,700 --> 00:58:47,940
was just referring to my Tumblr that I never fucking used,

1386
00:58:47,940 --> 00:58:49,620
and it was embarrassing, so.

1387
00:58:49,620 --> 00:58:54,260
And JustinMcElroy.com is for a Canadian reporter, I believe.

1388
00:58:54,260 --> 00:58:55,060
Do you have.org?

1389
00:58:57,060 --> 00:58:59,380
Yeah, he got to the.com.

1390
00:58:59,940 --> 00:59:01,300
We haven't talked about that recently,

1391
00:59:01,300 --> 00:59:03,620
but I don't really appreciate him doing that.

1392
00:59:03,620 --> 00:59:04,980
I think.org might be available.

1393
00:59:06,580 --> 00:59:07,780
Or.pizza.

1394
00:59:07,780 --> 00:59:09,220
I used to have a website.

1395
00:59:09,220 --> 00:59:10,580
I did have a website.

1396
00:59:10,580 --> 00:59:12,260
You had one for a bit, though.

1397
00:59:12,260 --> 00:59:13,460
Yeah, I had one for a grit.

1398
00:59:13,460 --> 00:59:14,740
I mean, I have my WordPress.

1399
00:59:15,300 --> 00:59:16,100
Yeah, that's weird.

1400
00:59:16,100 --> 00:59:17,380
But I don't know, that's weird.

1401
00:59:17,380 --> 00:59:20,660
Anyway, don't have the WordPress either,

1402
00:59:20,660 --> 00:59:21,860
so don't go hunting for it.

1403
00:59:22,900 --> 00:59:25,860
Except on Christmas, apparently updated during Christmas time

1404
00:59:25,860 --> 00:59:27,220
with my favorite playlist.

1405
00:59:27,220 --> 00:59:27,860
I'm looking at it now.

1406
00:59:27,860 --> 00:59:29,540
That's all I have is just Christmas playlists.

1407
00:59:31,540 --> 00:59:33,700
That's all of our show.

1408
00:59:33,700 --> 00:59:34,980
There's no more of the show.

1409
00:59:34,980 --> 00:59:37,380
So this is the end of it.

1410
00:59:37,380 --> 00:59:39,540
Here's a final Yahoo from Jeffrey Corbello.

1411
00:59:39,540 --> 00:59:40,020
Thank you, Jeffrey.

1412
00:59:40,020 --> 00:59:41,140
It's Yahoo Answers user.

1413
00:59:41,700 --> 00:59:43,220
Please just give me one fucking...

1414
00:59:43,220 --> 00:59:43,720
Okay.

1415
00:59:44,660 --> 00:59:49,140
ArterUSA's key.

1416
00:59:50,260 --> 00:59:51,300
Oh, man, I don't know.

1417
00:59:51,940 --> 00:59:52,580
Thank you.

1418
00:59:52,580 --> 00:59:53,460
Whatever your name is.

1419
00:59:54,180 --> 00:59:58,820
Asks, I'm a fan of Kevin Costner.

1420
00:59:58,820 --> 01:00:00,500
Can any of you beat that?

1421
01:00:04,020 --> 01:00:05,620
My name is Justin McElroy.

1422
01:00:05,620 --> 01:00:06,820
I'm Travis McElroy.

1423
01:00:06,820 --> 01:00:08,020
I'm Griffin McElroy.

1424
01:00:08,020 --> 01:00:08,980
This has been my brother, my brother.

1425
01:00:08,980 --> 01:00:10,180
May you kiss your dad.

1426
01:00:10,180 --> 01:00:19,780
Square on the lips.

1427
01:00:28,900 --> 01:00:30,820

1428
01:00:30,820 --> 01:00:31,860

My name is Parker.

1433
01:00:38,260 --> 01:00:42,180
Max Fun Con has been a huge inspiration in my life.

1434
01:00:42,180 --> 01:00:47,460
Now I have this network of friends that I've made that's been literally across the entire

1435
01:00:47,460 --> 01:00:50,500
globe and they're some of my favorite people in the world.

1436
01:00:50,500 --> 01:00:56,100
I truly cannot believe the amount of wonderful and lasting friendships that have come out

1437
01:00:56,100 --> 01:00:56,660
of this.

1438
01:00:56,660 --> 01:01:01,860
If you feel like you might not fit in, as long as you're a good person, you'll fit in

1439
01:01:01,860 --> 01:01:06,100
because everyone there is good and amazing and kind and wonderful.

1440
01:01:06,100 --> 01:01:08,340
And you should absolutely go.

1441
01:01:08,340 --> 01:01:10,420
It will be the best decision of your life.
