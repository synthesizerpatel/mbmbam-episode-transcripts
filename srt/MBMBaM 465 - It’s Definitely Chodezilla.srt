1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:30,640
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:47,840
Hello everybody, and welcome to my brother, my brother, mean advice show for the modern era.

6
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:54,000
I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy. And I, as always, am your middlest brother,

7
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,160
Travis McElroy. Yeah, it's Griffin.

8
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:00,800
And you're probably wondering how Griffin got here.

9
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:07,280
God stepped on a dang bear trap again. Folks, bad news. Kind of a slow start

10
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,640
to the summer blockbuster season. Men in Black International disappoints.

11
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:19,360
So far, it's pulled in 32 domestic, 73 milo. That's not a lot.

12
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:20,960
That's not a lot. No, that's not a lot.

13
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:25,200
That's not a production budget of 110 milo. Of course, you got to remember,

14
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:30,880
50% of that is going to go back to the studios. They got to clear 220 just to kind of get a

15
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:34,880
little green. How's Dark Fino doing?

16
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:42,240
Dark Fino, big disappointment. We're talking about, so far,

17
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:49,040
205 milo domestic on an unknown budget, but probably high.

18
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:55,520
What about Godzilla? Godzilla got nothing, no dollars. It's a huge disappointment.

19
00:01:55,520 --> 00:02:00,160
Big stinker, stinky. It's not out for two more days, but Toy Story 4,

20
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:04,240
I'm going to go ahead and call it. Shit sales. No tickets.

21
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:07,440
We're tired of it. Tired of it. Are they toys? Are they people?

22
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:11,120
Do they have souls? Are they ghosts? Do they make love? What's the deal?

23
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:13,760
We're tired of it. We just want to be done with them.

24
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:16,560
We thought we were done with them. Rocket Man's okay.

25
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:22,480
Rocket Man's doing okay. 66 milo on a 40 milo budget.

26
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:25,520
Blasting off. Not great, but blasting off.

27
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:29,680
How's J-Wick 3? J-Wick 3, of course, huge sales.

28
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:32,960
Everyone's crazy about J-Wick 3. Are movies done?

29
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:36,400
Are movies done? Well, not yet, Trav, because we have good news.

30
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:44,400
We, the box office doctors, Dr. B.O. They call us Dr. B.O.

31
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:46,960
And we're here to bring it home. And we don't like it. Let's be clear.

32
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:48,880
We find that name mean. We do not like that name.

33
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:54,720
It's hasteless. It's a tasteless name, but we are here to try to save.

34
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:58,000
I just want to, we want to save this movie going season.

35
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:02,240
Avengers, it did fine. That made a lot of money.

36
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:08,160
I want to fire up this year in movie making

37
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:10,800
to get some real big grosses in the theater.

38
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:13,840
I'm going to hit you guys with this, Avengers Endgame 2.

39
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:18,000
What is that? What does that look like when they make that one, Travis?

40
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,400
Oh, what would that movie look like? Yeah, tell me now.

41
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:24,160
I have a pitch, but I want to pitch you guys on this.

42
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:29,920
All the heroes die. A bunch of regular ass people died.

43
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:34,080
And the movie skips over that. What Avengers Endgame 2

44
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:37,840
has the bravery to say is, let's luxuriate.

45
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:42,000
Let's just enjoy the lack of lines at Target.

46
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:47,360
Let's get down deep into the Luckmire and see what it's like

47
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:52,960
when all those people die for a bit. Avengers Endgame 2 is about the benefits.

48
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:56,240
If the lines are shorter at Target, that's more time for drama.

49
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:58,800
And that's all I'm saying is that you don't have to have,

50
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:02,560
you know how every movie has 20 minute long scenes

51
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:08,800
where people are in line at Target? This movie has the courage to skip those

52
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:12,160
and just give you more of the character action you crave.

53
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:16,720
Aladdin, what if you made a cartoon of that one?

54
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:19,520
Sure. Let's get it out there.

55
00:04:19,520 --> 00:04:23,200
I have a pitch for kind of a different take on Godzilla.

56
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:27,760
See, everybody makes that thunder lizard real big, right?

57
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:33,040
Real tall, but what if he was real wide? Okay.

58
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:37,280
So this is the wide Godzilla. Instead of being like 100 feet tall

59
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:41,360
and 20 feet wide, he's 20 feet tall and 100 feet wide.

60
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:43,600
I'm not saying round. I'm not saying round.

61
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:45,920
And let me step in here because I've already, Travis,

62
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:48,240
I've got the marketing team on the phone and they are saying,

63
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:50,560
what is it? Are you sure?

64
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:53,760
Are you absolutely certain? Okay.

65
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:58,240
Chodezilla. I don't think so.

66
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:00,800
And I don't think so. I don't think so.

67
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:03,600
Yeah, but that's what they came up with down in marketing.

68
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:06,800
Yeah, down market. Maybe I misheard it because I get weird static.

69
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:08,560
I'm no, it's definitely Chodezilla.

70
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:15,280
Yeah, that's pretty good. I like Godzilla.

71
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:21,200
Chodezilla. The load is wide. The coast is searched.

72
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:23,120
Yeah, pretty good. Pretty good.

73
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:25,840
Actually, wait. No, the marketing team didn't like that.

74
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:27,600
They didn't like that. Yeah.

75
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:29,120
They think it clashes with Chodezilla.

76
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:31,200
I don't even know what that means. I don't think words can clash.

77
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:36,080
I have another one too because they just brought out Shaft.

78
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:37,840
Another Shaft. Okay.

79
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:40,240
Maybe instead, another Shrek.

80
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:44,080
Shrek 2. I think it's time for us to finally do it.

81
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:47,680
What's he been doing in the swamp? Who's he dating?

82
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:50,960
I think we might be on Shrek 8 at this point.

83
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:53,840
No, I know. This is the reboot of Shrek 2.

84
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:56,880
Travis. They were going to reboot Shrek 1.

85
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:59,680
And I called him and I said, it's the perfect movie.

86
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:03,120
Eddie Murphy, Mike Myers, Cameron Diaz,

87
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:05,920
and the third rock guy, Lothgau is in it.

88
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:09,680
He's got the heat and it's got a dragon and the dance scene

89
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:11,440
and Puss in Boots is in too.

90
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:13,680
That's where it stopped making sense for me.

91
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:17,200
So we're going to reboot 2. No Puss in Boots in this one.

92
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:23,920
Just a lot of Shrek and Fiona kissing for long periods of time.

93
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:26,160
Then they do wait in the target line for a little bit

94
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:27,680
and then it's just right back to kissing

95
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:29,440
while Donkey says things like,

96
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:33,920
hey guys, the movie's going, should we be having

97
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:36,960
some sort of dragon adventure or shoot, you're still kissing.

98
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:38,880
Can I hit you with you?

99
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:40,800
Travis, I want to hit you with something that you're going to love.

100
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:41,760
Please don't. That would hurt.

101
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:52,480
Rocketman 2, except it's a sequel to the 1997 Rocketman

102
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:54,000
starring Harlan Williams now.

103
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:58,480
But it's released so closely to the other one,

104
00:06:58,480 --> 00:07:01,440
people are going to assume, and maybe for the trailer

105
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:04,080
you play a little bit of Elton John music.

106
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:06,160
Oh, that's great.

107
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:11,040
We could also just take the original cut of Rocketman

108
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:13,760
and maybe remaster it a bit, take it to Weta

109
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:15,680
and get them to touch it up here and there

110
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:18,240
and we play all the Elton John songs over it.

111
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:19,920
So we could have Goodbye Yellow Brick Road

112
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:21,920
in that one scene where he farts so much

113
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:23,760
that his space suit explodes.

114
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:24,800
Yes.

115
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:28,160
Or we could do, oh, you know, be funny as if it was like

116
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:30,960
a candle in the breaking wind so we could have him

117
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:32,160
do parody stuff.

118
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:34,720
How about people in black?

119
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:36,240
Pib.

120
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:37,040
That could be fun.

121
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:41,280
Or people in whatever.

122
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:42,400
People in clothes.

123
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:43,440
Yes.

124
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:46,240
That's people in clothes is great.

125
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:49,040
But we can't do any nudes in that one.

126
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:50,080
No, not yet.

127
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:52,880
You saved that for number two and you call it

128
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:55,520
People in Clothes Tudes.

129
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:57,920
And it's the number two, D-E, Tude.

130
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:05,200
And then that's the sequel where there's explicit nudity.

131
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:09,200
Pokemon Bus Driver Pikachu.

132
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:09,760
Okay.

133
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:13,440
You can put any job in there and just make it different.

134
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:15,200
He doesn't have to be a detective.

135
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:17,040
Pokemon Assassin Pikachu.

136
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:20,640
That's what the games are basically.

137
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:23,280
Oh, who just cracked him up a cold one?

138
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:26,720
Pokemon Sewage Treatment Pikachu.

139
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:29,040
Someone's trying to enjoy suds and buds.

140
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:30,640
Who's that cracking one?

141
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:34,480
It's a...

142
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:37,040
Oh, cracking a BL orange.

143
00:08:37,040 --> 00:08:37,920
Yeah, dude.

144
00:08:37,920 --> 00:08:39,200
We can't have this.

145
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:40,960
That's what I call Hollywood fuel.

146
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:43,440
That's what keeps the wheels spinning, baby.

147
00:08:44,160 --> 00:08:46,960
It's a Coca-Cola Zero Orange Vanilla.

148
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:47,280
Nice.

149
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:49,360
I've got it.

150
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:52,640
A prequel Pokemon Unemployed Pikachu.

151
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:54,400
Stop it.

152
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:56,880
And it's just Pikachu going through the one ends,

153
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:58,880
going in for interviews,

154
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:02,000
not quite making it through the interview

155
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,520
because he is a Pokemon.

156
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:07,440
Hey guys, at what point there...

157
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:08,880
I want to go inside the bit.

158
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:11,840
At what point during this bit did you pivot from

159
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:15,200
this is going pretty good to we've never been funny

160
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:16,480
and we'll never be funny again.

161
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:16,960
I'm not there yet.

162
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:18,000
Because that's sort of the...

163
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:18,880
You're not there yet.

164
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:21,440
Because that is sort of the panic that I'm experiencing

165
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:24,400
over on this end that did prompt me to pop up in a cold one.

166
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:26,480
See if I can reinvigorate the brain cells

167
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:28,240
with a little bit of Coke Zero.

168
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:28,960
How about...

169
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:30,000
I've got it.

170
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,200
Guys, I've got it.

171
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:33,600
Two popular movies that could be more popular.

172
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:35,520
Okay, you ready for this?

173
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:36,000
I call it...

174
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:36,800
Thank God for you.

175
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:37,600
Book Dumbo.

176
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:42,400
Inability to see within and to see without.

177
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:45,360
See, instead of book smart, they're book dumb.

178
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:48,800
But also instead of... Because then they're applying elephant

179
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:50,000
who like three books.

180
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,920
I'm all ego over here.

181
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:56,560
I'm all deep within my own consciousness,

182
00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:00,720
contemplating my irrelevance as I, you know,

183
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:01,840
hurdle towards 40.

184
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:05,200
I feel like my best work is behind me and Travis...

185
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:06,320
Sha-yam.

186
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:09,440
And it's about a yam with magic powers.

187
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:11,760
Oh my God, Justin, they're getting worse, man.

188
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:14,560
See, now I'm in...

189
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:16,720
I'm in Carvel and it's about an ice cream store

190
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:18,080
that's also a superhero.

191
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:20,080
He's brought me back in.

192
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:23,840
How do I get my coworkers to genuinely leave me alone

193
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:25,760
before I've had my morning coffee?

194
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:26,820
How do I...

195
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:31,600
How do I ask them to back off

196
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:34,560
and tell them I had a good 300 milligrams of caffeine in me

197
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:36,400
without sounding like an overused caption

198
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:37,680
on a corporate coffee cup?

199
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:40,960
And that's from Cranky Coffee Consumer in Colorado.

200
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:42,960
That's gotta be tough, right?

201
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:45,440
Because if you're like, hey, please just leave me alone.

202
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:46,800
I haven't had my coffee.

203
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:48,640
Oh, the nice one.

204
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:49,440
Yeah, I get it.

205
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,920
So anyways, what did you do last night?

206
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:55,200
It's like, no, I really hate you.

207
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:56,080
Please don't.

208
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:57,600
I need this to talk to you.

209
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:01,440
You've gotta start having your coffee earlier.

210
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:02,160
This is good.

211
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:03,120
You can't.

212
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:05,760
You gotta be up before anybody.

213
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:06,960
You can't risk this.

214
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:09,680
This is apparently a very real situation for you.

215
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:11,280
You have to be up at four in the morning,

216
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:12,960
cranking beans.

217
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:14,240
Well, but Justin, there you are,

218
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:15,200
cranking those beans,

219
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:17,120
and somebody's just gonna get into your house

220
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:19,360
to talk to you before that happens.

221
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:21,360
They smell the beans are grinding

222
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:23,840
and they're like, they smash into the window.

223
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:26,000
Pretty soon they'll start talking to you the night before.

224
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:28,000
You know what I mean?

225
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,600
And then what, Justin?

226
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:31,600
You're just gonna crank your beans in bed

227
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:32,800
in front of God and everybody?

228
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:34,800
Come on.

229
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:35,600
What a mess.

230
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:37,440
Tell me where I can crank my beans.

231
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:40,880
I don't even know if it's safe to crank your beans these days

232
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:41,840
in this economy?

233
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:46,000
What's great about this is it's a self-fulfilling idea.

234
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,320
Because if you do start saying to your coworkers

235
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:50,080
any sort of amalgamation of,

236
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:52,960
please don't, I can't with you right now, Barbara,

237
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:57,440
because I haven't had my good brown bean juice yet.

238
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:59,200
There's a beverage that I have to have

239
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:00,880
in order for me to even listen

240
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:02,960
to the dumb shit you say every day.

241
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:05,920
If you say that to a person, great news,

242
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:07,920
they'll never come talk to you again

243
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:09,520
if you have your coffee or don't.

244
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:12,480
You will be the mean office person, so.

245
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:14,720
You can have your coffee for the luxury of your home

246
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:16,080
because you will be unemployed.

247
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:19,840
Yeah, just get the coffee sooner.

248
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:20,800
I really don't know.

249
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:26,480
You can't value people less than a good hot bean juice.

250
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:27,200
You know what I mean?

251
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:28,080
It seems rude.

252
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:30,080
What you have to communicate to them

253
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:34,560
is you're showing them respect and caring and nurturing

254
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:39,120
by saving them from you pre-bean juice.

255
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:39,620
That's correct.

256
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:41,200
Does that make sense?

257
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,600
You have to take care of yourself

258
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:46,400
before you can take care of other people.

259
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:48,640
If you want to be an efficient caregiver

260
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:49,760
in any sort of setting,

261
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:55,520
you have to have achieved your coffee earlier than that.

262
00:12:55,520 --> 00:12:58,160
I wake up before everyone in my house

263
00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:01,920
and the first thing I do is start drinking coffee

264
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:04,400
is the first thing I do.

265
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:07,600
So when they wake up, they don't know that man,

266
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:10,720
that lonely man that walks the halls

267
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:14,400
and lurks in the shadows because they never meet him.

268
00:13:15,280 --> 00:13:19,120
He's only up from 645 to 655 while he makes his job.

269
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:20,640
That's the fussy man.

270
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:24,080
We don't talk about the fussy man in this household.

271
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:25,440
We don't speak of the fussy man.

272
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:27,760
Nobody ever goes in.

273
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:30,720
I think you could play that out even more

274
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:32,640
and just build up a whole like,

275
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:35,840
tell your co-workers like, I'd love to stop and talk,

276
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:38,400
but I have to take this coffee to go kill the fussy man

277
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:39,760
and then leave.

278
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:42,000
Do you want to make an appointment with me

279
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:44,480
or do you want to talk to the fussy man?

280
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:44,800
That's it.

281
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:48,400
Because he is here currently and he's got my office.

282
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:50,000
I have an idea.

283
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:50,400
Okay.

284
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:52,000
Do you want to hear an idea?

285
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:52,320
Yes.

286
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:54,640
You put a sign up that says,

287
00:13:54,640 --> 00:13:57,200
this cubicle or office or whatever it is

288
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:02,320
has been entered into a co-working office sharing program.

289
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:08,240
I will be, I, Dylan, who everybody knows and loves,

290
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:10,400
will be sharing an office with a man named Gustav

291
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:12,080
who does not understand our business

292
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:15,760
and it's not to be shared proprietary information

293
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:16,400
with Gustav.

294
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:20,000
Then every morning when you go to work,

295
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:24,880
you have a kind of festive bowler and maybe a monocle

296
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:26,560
and some sort of mustache.

297
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:28,320
I don't know exactly the getup.

298
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:30,320
It's got to be something you could apply every day.

299
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:33,360
Some spirit glue and a Gustav, a little bit of spirit.

300
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:34,960
A Gustav skin mask.

301
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:36,560
Something.

302
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:38,240
Yeah, you see Mission Impossible.

303
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:43,200
And anyway, Gustav, he has, he is the one who drinks the coffee.

304
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:44,960
He's the one that coffee is gone.

305
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:46,000
He loves coffee.

306
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:46,480
Right.

307
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:47,600
Yes, yes.

308
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:50,960
He's a coffee taster, is what he does for a living.

309
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:53,200
He's using this co-working thing to get out of the house.

310
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:58,560
After he's done, he goes into a broom closet and dies.

311
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:02,960
And dies every day.

312
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:04,400
And then who comes out?

313
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:07,440
It's you looking fresh and ready for the day.

314
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:09,440
And you've killed Gustav again.

315
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:13,120
Until Gustav climbs back into your body while you're asleep.

316
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:14,800
Shit, Gustav.

317
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:17,760
Gustav's such a messy little fuck.

318
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:20,080
I love him.

319
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:22,240
What happens when your co-workers and your boss

320
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:23,760
start to like Gustav better?

321
00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:26,480
That is a huge, they're not going to.

322
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:27,760
He's a fucking dick.

323
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:28,640
But you know what?

324
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:31,920
People like that bad boy sometimes, Justin.

325
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:33,280
Ah, dude.

326
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:36,240
If people like the bad boy, your problem is solved.

327
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:38,640
They love you no matter what.

328
00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:39,140
Yeah.

329
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:42,160
Get on some Maxtrum shit.

330
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:45,200
You could do like I do when people try to talk to me

331
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:46,880
about serious stuff before I've had coffee

332
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:48,400
and just cry a little bit.

333
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:51,840
Just cry a little bit and then they'll probably

334
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:53,280
go find something else to do.

335
00:15:53,280 --> 00:15:53,600
Yeah.

336
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:55,920
Tell them you're having a really hard time right now.

337
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:58,240
It's probably true.

338
00:15:58,240 --> 00:15:59,120
Do you want a Yahoo?

339
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:00,560
Yes, please.

340
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:01,920
I got one sent in by Emily.

341
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:02,480
Thanks, Emily.

342
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:05,200
It's Yahoo Answers user Sayana who asks,

343
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:08,800
what's your weed whacking style like?

344
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:10,160
Whoa.

345
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:12,640
Do you use barely enough gas to cut the weeds?

346
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:16,240
Or are you one of those people that really goes for it?

347
00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:18,020
Huh.

348
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:21,440
You know, I've never really thought about it before,

349
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:23,440
but I guess mine's pretty whimsical.

350
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:26,400
Oh, yeah, I would say so.

351
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:26,800
I would say so.

352
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:29,440
I like to stand in one place and kind of swing around

353
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:33,280
in a circle to kind of, I like to make hairs.

354
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:34,960
This is my thing.

355
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:36,080
Don't tell anybody, okay?

356
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:39,840
I like to make patterns in the yard that make it look

357
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:41,840
like aliens have landed.

358
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:44,000
I like to cut Spiderman in my yard.

359
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:44,500
Nice.

360
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:46,880
How much gasoline do you use?

361
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:49,280
Six.

362
00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:49,840
Six or seven.

363
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:50,800
Oh, really?

364
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:51,300
Yeah.

365
00:16:51,300 --> 00:16:53,220
Oh, man, I have to get some tips from you.

366
00:16:53,220 --> 00:16:55,220
I usually use like 12 and a half.

367
00:16:56,420 --> 00:16:58,340
Yeah, well, I only do half the yard.

368
00:16:58,340 --> 00:17:01,460
The rest, yeah, the Spiderman is a pretty light lift.

369
00:17:01,460 --> 00:17:03,460
Just what's your weed whacking style?

370
00:17:03,940 --> 00:17:04,900
I have a boy.

371
00:17:05,540 --> 00:17:06,040
You what?

372
00:17:06,820 --> 00:17:07,620
I have a boy.

373
00:17:08,580 --> 00:17:09,860
Like a neighborhood youth?

374
00:17:10,820 --> 00:17:12,900
A neighborhood youth, okay.

375
00:17:13,620 --> 00:17:15,060
I have a boy for that job.

376
00:17:15,620 --> 00:17:17,700
How do you contact a boy when you need him?

377
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:19,620
He's there when I need him.

378
00:17:19,620 --> 00:17:20,900
He's there when I need him?

379
00:17:20,900 --> 00:17:21,540
He just knows?

380
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:23,940
He checks the weeds.

381
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:29,620
He says, Dr. McElroy, I haven't told him a lot about my life.

382
00:17:29,620 --> 00:17:32,580
I need to keep him at a distance because I don't trust him.

383
00:17:32,580 --> 00:17:37,540
And he says, Dr. McElroy, your weeds are in need of whacking.

384
00:17:37,540 --> 00:17:39,860
I say, well, boy, you know the cure for that?

385
00:17:39,860 --> 00:17:40,900
You know the prescription?

386
00:17:41,460 --> 00:17:42,180
Here's $3.

387
00:17:43,620 --> 00:17:45,220
And then the boy whacks the weeds for me.

388
00:17:45,220 --> 00:17:45,860
Not in this.

389
00:17:45,860 --> 00:17:47,380
No, Justin.

390
00:17:47,380 --> 00:17:50,420
You have a lawn mower, right?

391
00:17:50,420 --> 00:17:51,540
You have a lawn mower.

392
00:17:51,540 --> 00:17:53,140
What's the weed whacker for?

393
00:17:53,140 --> 00:17:54,260
For weeds.

394
00:17:54,260 --> 00:17:54,820
Really?

395
00:17:54,820 --> 00:17:55,780
Drama.

396
00:17:55,780 --> 00:17:56,420
Drama.

397
00:17:56,420 --> 00:17:56,900
That's it.

398
00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:02,100
It's for drama and to sell filament.

399
00:18:02,100 --> 00:18:02,740
That's it.

400
00:18:03,860 --> 00:18:04,420
That's it.

401
00:18:04,420 --> 00:18:08,340
People want to get down and chop their dirt up and kill some worms

402
00:18:08,340 --> 00:18:10,500
because it's a perversion.

403
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:15,380
And I let the boy treat his dark passenger to some worm murder.

404
00:18:15,380 --> 00:18:17,140
He makes $3 off the deal.

405
00:18:17,140 --> 00:18:19,460
And I never have to hear about this business ever again.

406
00:18:19,460 --> 00:18:21,540
It's got to be more than $3, though, right, Juice?

407
00:18:22,260 --> 00:18:22,820
Four.

408
00:18:22,820 --> 00:18:23,460
Fine.

409
00:18:23,460 --> 00:18:23,940
Yes.

410
00:18:23,940 --> 00:18:24,660
OK.

411
00:18:24,660 --> 00:18:25,060
Fine.

412
00:18:25,060 --> 00:18:25,620
Yes.

413
00:18:25,620 --> 00:18:26,020
All right.

414
00:18:26,580 --> 00:18:27,860
Two ghosts.

415
00:18:27,860 --> 00:18:31,140
Where's the third one to tell me about how I need to give more

416
00:18:31,700 --> 00:18:33,220
dollars to the weed whacking boy?

417
00:18:35,700 --> 00:18:37,460
I'll buy his family a turkey.

418
00:18:37,460 --> 00:18:38,740
How's that sound?

419
00:18:38,740 --> 00:18:39,940
Let him whack that turkey.

420
00:18:40,580 --> 00:18:42,180
I'm going to get myself a goat.

421
00:18:42,180 --> 00:18:42,900
Pay him $3.

422
00:18:43,620 --> 00:18:46,980
Justin, this neighborhood youth, what would you say his weed whacking style is?

423
00:18:46,980 --> 00:18:47,780
The weed boy.

424
00:18:47,780 --> 00:18:48,500
The weed boy.

425
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:51,380
What is his sort of what's his weed whacking style?

426
00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:55,460
If I have to spend a single second contemplating weeds,

427
00:18:55,460 --> 00:19:00,260
and I'm including this time here, then the $3 is wasted.

428
00:19:01,060 --> 00:19:05,700
I never want to think about weeds and their need to be whacked again ever.

429
00:19:05,700 --> 00:19:11,940
And I have the luxury of the boy who comes to my house to whack the weeds for me.

430
00:19:11,940 --> 00:19:13,860
You can't even give him a fiber, Justin.

431
00:19:13,860 --> 00:19:15,780
You'd rather make change?

432
00:19:15,780 --> 00:19:17,140
I know you, Justin.

433
00:19:17,140 --> 00:19:18,820
I know your soul.

434
00:19:18,820 --> 00:19:21,140
I've seen the fucking dark heart of you.

435
00:19:21,140 --> 00:19:24,740
And I know the anxiety that dwells within you because it's in my blood, too.

436
00:19:24,740 --> 00:19:26,100
It's in all our blood.

437
00:19:26,100 --> 00:19:30,260
So I know that you have definitely had the thought of how much do I pay this person for

438
00:19:30,260 --> 00:19:32,100
doing a task I don't want to do?

439
00:19:32,100 --> 00:19:35,140
And I know you well enough to know that your brain didn't bounce to,

440
00:19:35,140 --> 00:19:36,260
eh, $3 seems fine.

441
00:19:36,260 --> 00:19:37,220
It probably bounced to-

442
00:19:37,220 --> 00:19:39,060
$3 the first time, that's what he asked for.

443
00:19:39,060 --> 00:19:42,420
If I had offered him $4 the next time, he would assume that every time he did it,

444
00:19:42,420 --> 00:19:44,180
he was going to make an extra dollar.

445
00:19:44,180 --> 00:19:49,940
Flash forward to, you know, 2020 where I'm shelling out 30 to 40 grand per weed whacking.

446
00:19:49,940 --> 00:19:51,300
I've done the math.

447
00:19:51,300 --> 00:19:53,780
The boy gets $3 or he whacks no weeds.

448
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:56,260
How old is- how old would you estimate?

449
00:19:56,980 --> 00:19:58,340
He's a boy, Griffin.

450
00:19:58,980 --> 00:19:59,300
Okay.

451
00:20:00,260 --> 00:20:01,620
He has not- he's not a man.

452
00:20:01,620 --> 00:20:03,620
He doesn't have the strength to bring me down.

453
00:20:03,620 --> 00:20:05,220
He doesn't have the strength to destroy me.

454
00:20:05,220 --> 00:20:07,780
When he becomes a weed man, will you pay him more?

455
00:20:08,660 --> 00:20:11,140
He will be dismissed summarily.

456
00:20:11,140 --> 00:20:20,500
I need my- I need my lawn tended to by the starry-eyed naivete of a child.

457
00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:23,700
With the care and precision that only a child can offer.

458
00:20:23,700 --> 00:20:29,860
A weed- a weed man is going to be too busy thinking about his sexual escapades.

459
00:20:29,860 --> 00:20:31,620
And his weed taxes.

460
00:20:31,620 --> 00:20:34,100
His next drink, his weed taxes.

461
00:20:34,100 --> 00:20:38,180
But the boy, to him, his entire world is my weeds.

462
00:20:38,180 --> 00:20:44,900
Because to him, they're a bright, shiny new comic book or soda phosphate.

463
00:20:44,900 --> 00:20:46,820
You know, whatever boys spend their money on.

464
00:20:46,820 --> 00:20:49,380
Yeah, three quarters of a pack of Pokemon cards.

465
00:20:49,380 --> 00:20:52,740
It may not be the same boy every time.

466
00:20:52,740 --> 00:20:57,060
I would have no way of knowing about the weed boy.

467
00:20:57,060 --> 00:20:59,540
You don't have his information for a W2?

468
00:20:59,540 --> 00:21:00,980
How on earth?

469
00:21:00,980 --> 00:21:04,500
I can't even summon him to whack weeds if I need him.

470
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:07,300
I don't have a- I don't have a light on top of the house.

471
00:21:07,300 --> 00:21:11,060
On top of the house that I flick on that looks like weeds.

472
00:21:11,060 --> 00:21:11,620
Not yet.

473
00:21:11,620 --> 00:21:13,700
He just comes when I need him.

474
00:21:13,700 --> 00:21:15,140
Alright, asked and answered.

475
00:21:17,300 --> 00:21:18,660
My birthday is today.

476
00:21:18,660 --> 00:21:19,060
Happy birthday.

477
00:21:19,060 --> 00:21:20,020
And I wanted to go out-

478
00:21:20,020 --> 00:21:20,820
Happy birthday.

479
00:21:20,820 --> 00:21:24,020
I wanted to go out to lunch with some of my co-workers to celebrate.

480
00:21:24,020 --> 00:21:25,860
Because it was during the middle of the week.

481
00:21:25,860 --> 00:21:28,420
Many people brought their lunch and couldn't come.

482
00:21:28,420 --> 00:21:30,500
So the group was very small.

483
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:32,100
And just people I work closely with.

484
00:21:32,100 --> 00:21:32,740
Which was fine.

485
00:21:32,740 --> 00:21:37,220
But one of my co-workers who couldn't come dropped what I believe to be

486
00:21:37,220 --> 00:21:39,460
some backhanded advice later that afternoon.

487
00:21:39,460 --> 00:21:42,500
He said, my birthday is coming up soon too.

488
00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:45,300
About a week out I start letting people know about it.

489
00:21:46,020 --> 00:21:50,260
It seems very cocky and forward to me to tell people it's my birthday

490
00:21:50,260 --> 00:21:52,100
and provoke the attention it brings.

491
00:21:52,100 --> 00:21:53,620
I never liked having to do that.

492
00:21:53,620 --> 00:21:55,140
But he brings up a good point.

493
00:21:55,140 --> 00:21:57,540
How do I let people know about my birthday coming up

494
00:21:57,540 --> 00:22:01,700
so they can go to lunch with us and not sound like a narcissist?

495
00:22:01,700 --> 00:22:05,140
It's all about me and Tennessee.

496
00:22:05,140 --> 00:22:08,340
Just take your birthday out of the equation entirely.

497
00:22:08,340 --> 00:22:09,140
Sup y'all?

498
00:22:09,140 --> 00:22:09,780
Outback.

499
00:22:09,780 --> 00:22:10,820
Next Wednesday.

500
00:22:10,820 --> 00:22:11,460
Get there.

501
00:22:11,460 --> 00:22:12,260
Blooming.

502
00:22:12,260 --> 00:22:12,820
Onion.

503
00:22:12,820 --> 00:22:13,940
Big steak.

504
00:22:13,940 --> 00:22:14,820
Tall beer.

505
00:22:14,820 --> 00:22:17,540
Let's do this fucking thing Wednesday 12 o'clock.

506
00:22:17,540 --> 00:22:18,420
Route 60.

507
00:22:18,420 --> 00:22:18,900
Fucking be there.

508
00:22:18,900 --> 00:22:22,420
But Dave Griffith, the feeling of your co-workers when you get there

509
00:22:22,420 --> 00:22:25,300
and you're like, oh by the way, it's my birthday.

510
00:22:25,300 --> 00:22:26,980
And they're like, oh you got me.

511
00:22:27,540 --> 00:22:28,820
They're gonna feel tricked.

512
00:22:28,820 --> 00:22:31,380
They can just say lunch is on us and move on with it.

513
00:22:31,380 --> 00:22:32,820
Like, do you just?

514
00:22:33,540 --> 00:22:39,540
Because the alternative is guess whose big day is coming on Wednesday?

515
00:22:39,540 --> 00:22:40,740
It's Ricky.

516
00:22:41,300 --> 00:22:41,860
That's me.

517
00:22:42,500 --> 00:22:43,940
That's exactly what I do.

518
00:22:45,540 --> 00:22:46,900
This is the thing.

519
00:22:46,900 --> 00:22:49,620
I was gonna go completely the other direction with this question

520
00:22:49,620 --> 00:22:54,500
that only now I'm trying to think is this perhaps, you know, because of me.

521
00:22:54,500 --> 00:22:58,260
Then I would sit there and be like, hey everybody, it's my birthday next week.

522
00:22:58,260 --> 00:22:59,620
What are you gonna do for me?

523
00:22:59,620 --> 00:23:03,540
What are you planning to make me feel like the special boy I am?

524
00:23:04,100 --> 00:23:05,380
You need a middle person.

525
00:23:05,380 --> 00:23:10,180
You need to have someone who is following all your dark machinations

526
00:23:10,900 --> 00:23:12,660
and someone who will get the word out

527
00:23:12,660 --> 00:23:17,300
but has that like that one layer removed where it's not crass.

528
00:23:17,300 --> 00:23:18,980
Like you're probably, here's a perfect thing.

529
00:23:18,980 --> 00:23:21,140
You probably have a brother who has the same birthday as you

530
00:23:21,140 --> 00:23:22,420
but different years.

531
00:23:22,420 --> 00:23:28,260
So if the two of you exchange that, like Travis and I, for example.

532
00:23:28,260 --> 00:23:29,380
Oh yeah, right.

533
00:23:29,380 --> 00:23:32,020
Like a lot of people, we're two people who have the same birthday.

534
00:23:32,020 --> 00:23:34,660
I would just sort of, and we worked at the same office.

535
00:23:34,660 --> 00:23:37,140
Maybe it sold rubber bands.

536
00:23:37,140 --> 00:23:39,380
Oh, I'm so deep in this story.

537
00:23:39,940 --> 00:23:42,100
Yeah, and I would tell people-

538
00:23:42,100 --> 00:23:45,940
Just so I know, we're looking to expand into orthodontia rubber bands

539
00:23:45,940 --> 00:23:50,180
just to make it clear, like we're trying to merge with another company

540
00:23:50,180 --> 00:23:52,020
that maybe Griffin works at that sells orthodontia.

541
00:23:52,020 --> 00:23:53,060
Can I work here too?

542
00:23:53,060 --> 00:23:54,180
I want to be in this fun role play.

543
00:23:54,180 --> 00:23:55,860
You don't work in our office.

544
00:23:55,860 --> 00:23:58,980
Do you want to be in the rubber band department or the gun department?

545
00:23:58,980 --> 00:23:59,700
Good question.

546
00:24:00,900 --> 00:24:01,940
I'll do guns.

547
00:24:01,940 --> 00:24:02,900
I'll do guns.

548
00:24:02,900 --> 00:24:06,500
Okay, you can be over in the gun annex or gun X, as we call it.

549
00:24:07,220 --> 00:24:07,620
Okay.

550
00:24:07,620 --> 00:24:09,860
It's not funny, but you need a little bit of, you know

551
00:24:09,860 --> 00:24:13,060
you're looking for any levity you can find when you're working that rat race.

552
00:24:14,740 --> 00:24:16,020
So anyway, you have your brother-

553
00:24:16,020 --> 00:24:16,820
What's our boss like?

554
00:24:16,820 --> 00:24:18,980
What is the boss like?

555
00:24:18,980 --> 00:24:22,020
Does he say embarrassing things to embarrass you sometimes?

556
00:24:22,660 --> 00:24:24,500
Would you say that your boss gets it?

557
00:24:25,380 --> 00:24:25,940
Good question.

558
00:24:25,940 --> 00:24:29,460
Our boss is Chris Christie, former mayor, governor of New Jersey.

559
00:24:29,460 --> 00:24:30,420
So he does run.

560
00:24:30,420 --> 00:24:31,220
No then.

561
00:24:31,220 --> 00:24:32,820
No is the answer then.

562
00:24:32,820 --> 00:24:33,860
No is the answer.

563
00:24:33,860 --> 00:24:35,300
Do we hate our jobs?

564
00:24:35,300 --> 00:24:37,060
What's my upper mobility like?

565
00:24:37,940 --> 00:24:39,140
We don't love them.

566
00:24:39,140 --> 00:24:42,100
I mean, the nice thing is there is upper mobility

567
00:24:42,100 --> 00:24:45,460
but it almost always requires you to switch from either the rubber band department

568
00:24:45,460 --> 00:24:46,420
or the gun department.

569
00:24:46,420 --> 00:24:51,940
Could I lobby the board of directors to fire Chris Christie and replace me as boss?

570
00:24:53,460 --> 00:24:54,740
You can try anything.

571
00:24:54,740 --> 00:24:58,820
You can try anything Travis, but these are way back to,

572
00:24:58,820 --> 00:25:00,980
these are like old school gum band guys.

573
00:25:00,980 --> 00:25:03,540
You know, they've been in the biz for forever.

574
00:25:03,540 --> 00:25:10,820
They're not gonna be fooled by some young upstart with visions of guns and rubber band futures.

575
00:25:10,820 --> 00:25:14,100
I have a big page though Justin about how we can score the big account.

576
00:25:15,300 --> 00:25:16,340
How would you make-

577
00:25:16,340 --> 00:25:17,620
The Cracker Barrel account.

578
00:25:18,500 --> 00:25:19,380
Here's the problem.

579
00:25:19,380 --> 00:25:20,740
I have two announcements.

580
00:25:20,740 --> 00:25:23,700
One, Travis's birthday is next week.

581
00:25:23,700 --> 00:25:24,820
Let's all do something.

582
00:25:25,380 --> 00:25:28,500
And then Trav, didn't you have, you had something you wanted to mention?

583
00:25:28,500 --> 00:25:31,860
I have a plan for the big account and how we're going to get it.

584
00:25:31,860 --> 00:25:36,580
But only if we fire that piece of shit and hire this guy as the boss.

585
00:25:36,580 --> 00:25:38,660
Did you have anything else Travis you wanted to do?

586
00:25:38,660 --> 00:25:43,860
And when you do that, I'm going to shoot these rubber bands right into the 21st century.

587
00:25:43,860 --> 00:25:48,820
Hey guys, it's me Crevin and oh, can I do, I'm in a role play.

588
00:25:49,620 --> 00:25:51,620
Travis had one thing, one other thing.

589
00:25:51,620 --> 00:25:54,580
So okay, I'll step back, I'll step- It's my birthday next week, don't forget.

590
00:25:54,580 --> 00:25:55,540
Crevin will wait his turn.

591
00:25:56,100 --> 00:25:57,300
No, you go ahead Crevin.

592
00:25:58,420 --> 00:25:59,700
Yeah, I just made a new gun.

593
00:26:01,300 --> 00:26:05,620
Yeah, the shape is really cool because you can throw it right down into a sewer drain

594
00:26:06,260 --> 00:26:08,020
and it will fit right in there.

595
00:26:08,020 --> 00:26:11,220
Now it's still a gun that fires only rubber bands, right Crevin?

596
00:26:11,780 --> 00:26:13,940
Oh, was that shit?

597
00:26:15,940 --> 00:26:17,140
That's Crevin.

598
00:26:17,140 --> 00:26:18,820
And then the title card will pop up.

599
00:26:18,820 --> 00:26:22,420
Oh, listen, shut up, listen.

600
00:26:22,420 --> 00:26:25,300
Everybody, Travis, are you sure you didn't have anything else?

601
00:26:25,300 --> 00:26:27,540
Oh yeah, somebody ate my yogurt.

602
00:26:28,260 --> 00:26:32,980
Okay, how do we make millennials buy rubber bands?

603
00:26:32,980 --> 00:26:34,820
Hey, don't look away from me.

604
00:26:35,380 --> 00:26:36,660
Do you fucking eat my yogurt?

605
00:26:37,540 --> 00:26:38,180
No.

606
00:26:38,180 --> 00:26:38,500
Chris?

607
00:26:39,460 --> 00:26:39,940
No.

608
00:26:39,940 --> 00:26:40,340
Chris?

609
00:26:41,220 --> 00:26:41,860
Okay, yeah.

610
00:26:41,860 --> 00:26:42,740
You're fired.

611
00:26:43,620 --> 00:26:46,020
You can't do that, you don't have the authority.

612
00:26:46,020 --> 00:26:49,620
Oh, don't I? And then I'm going to shoot a rubber band at him.

613
00:26:49,620 --> 00:26:50,020
Uh-oh.

614
00:26:51,300 --> 00:26:53,780
I'll hoist it by my own gun band.

615
00:26:53,780 --> 00:26:54,420
You're fired.

616
00:26:54,420 --> 00:26:56,180
Hey, listen, it's me, Justin.

617
00:26:56,180 --> 00:26:58,340
I have a question for everybody at the meeting.

618
00:26:58,900 --> 00:27:00,260
There's seven or eight of us now.

619
00:27:00,980 --> 00:27:04,420
How do we make the millennials start buying rubber bands?

620
00:27:04,420 --> 00:27:09,860
And I want to know everyone, you had two weeks to put together a presentation

621
00:27:09,860 --> 00:27:12,180
for how to make millennials buy rubber bands.

622
00:27:12,180 --> 00:27:14,900
Travis, you asked to go first.

623
00:27:14,900 --> 00:27:18,900
You said you would make everybody, I'm looking at the memo you sent me.

624
00:27:18,900 --> 00:27:21,700
You said that your presentation would make everyone,

625
00:27:22,900 --> 00:27:26,660
everyone else's presentations, quote, look like the feudal ravings of a madman.

626
00:27:26,660 --> 00:27:27,220
Correct.

627
00:27:27,220 --> 00:27:29,220
And they should just burn them in a fire right now.

628
00:27:29,220 --> 00:27:32,180
Travis, how are you going to make the millennials buy rubber bands?

629
00:27:32,180 --> 00:27:36,900
Edible rubber bands that you get inside a tiny house.

630
00:27:38,980 --> 00:27:41,620
So you have to buy the house in order to get the gum candy?

631
00:27:41,620 --> 00:27:48,100
Yes, or you buy the gummy rubber bands and then you get a tiny house if you buy enough.

632
00:27:48,100 --> 00:27:49,620
I call them rubber band points.

633
00:27:50,180 --> 00:27:53,140
You gotta use those rubber band points to earn a tiny house.

634
00:27:53,140 --> 00:27:54,260
That's pretty good shit.

635
00:27:55,300 --> 00:27:56,820
That's way better than my idea.

636
00:27:56,820 --> 00:27:57,620
I don't even want to say my idea.

637
00:27:57,620 --> 00:27:58,660
What was yours?

638
00:27:58,660 --> 00:27:59,860
No, it was so bad.

639
00:27:59,860 --> 00:28:02,180
Griffin, you were, Trevon, Trevon.

640
00:28:02,180 --> 00:28:03,060
Wait, who's Trevon?

641
00:28:03,700 --> 00:28:05,220
Is Trevon related to Crevon?

642
00:28:06,180 --> 00:28:08,420
Crevon, Trevon's brother, Crevon.

643
00:28:08,420 --> 00:28:12,260
Hey, isn't it both your birthdays coming up pretty soon?

644
00:28:12,260 --> 00:28:15,460
Crevon, how are you going to make the millennials buy rubber bands?

645
00:28:15,460 --> 00:28:16,340
It's so stupid.

646
00:28:16,340 --> 00:28:17,540
I don't even want to say it.

647
00:28:17,540 --> 00:28:19,220
Say it or you're fired.

648
00:28:19,220 --> 00:28:20,820
Listen, we've talked about this, Crevon.

649
00:28:20,820 --> 00:28:22,660
You gotta have more confidence in yourself.

650
00:28:23,220 --> 00:28:26,820
This is what the moment you've been training for in all those montages.

651
00:28:26,820 --> 00:28:28,500
This has all been building up to this.

652
00:28:28,500 --> 00:28:34,180
Okay, well, I guess it's who's hot right now in social media, would you say?

653
00:28:35,220 --> 00:28:36,100
That's right.

654
00:28:36,100 --> 00:28:37,540
Justin Guarini.

655
00:28:37,540 --> 00:28:40,740
So we're going to take this dude and we're going to wrap these rubber bands across his

656
00:28:40,740 --> 00:28:43,620
arms and make it look all lumpy like the Michelin Man.

657
00:28:43,620 --> 00:28:45,220
And the teens are going to love this.

658
00:28:45,780 --> 00:28:47,460
And we call it the rubber band challenge.

659
00:28:48,100 --> 00:28:49,380
The rubber band challenge.

660
00:28:49,380 --> 00:28:51,620
How many rubber bands can you get around your-

661
00:28:51,620 --> 00:28:52,420
Justin Guarini.

662
00:28:52,420 --> 00:28:52,740
Head.

663
00:28:53,540 --> 00:28:56,820
How many rubber bands can you get around your head before it splits like that one

664
00:28:56,820 --> 00:28:58,420
watermelon stunt that kids love?

665
00:28:58,420 --> 00:28:59,780
Oh, I don't know about all that, Justin.

666
00:29:00,660 --> 00:29:05,460
Here at Travis McElroy's rubber bands and stuff, I just rebanded it.

667
00:29:06,260 --> 00:29:06,980
That sounds-

668
00:29:06,980 --> 00:29:07,780
You rebanded it?

669
00:29:07,780 --> 00:29:08,740
Rebanded it.

670
00:29:08,740 --> 00:29:09,940
Sounds a little dangerous.

671
00:29:11,140 --> 00:29:16,580
How many watermelons can you get around your head before you have to go buy a rubber band?

672
00:29:16,580 --> 00:29:17,540
I love it.

673
00:29:17,540 --> 00:29:18,660
Put that on the package.

674
00:29:19,860 --> 00:29:22,580
Travis, in the words of my niece, you're canceled.

675
00:29:22,580 --> 00:29:23,220
Oh, man.

676
00:29:24,340 --> 00:29:26,500
Next up to run the company is Crevin.

677
00:29:26,500 --> 00:29:28,580
We love this Justin Guarini idea.

678
00:29:28,580 --> 00:29:29,060
Cool.

679
00:29:29,060 --> 00:29:30,180
Want to know my next one?

680
00:29:31,780 --> 00:29:33,300
I can't believe you have another one.

681
00:29:33,300 --> 00:29:34,580
That didn't take you all weekend?

682
00:29:34,580 --> 00:29:40,100
Uh, no, man, I did a big speedball and it just sort of came to me in like a minute and a half, so.

683
00:29:40,740 --> 00:29:41,780
Okay, what's your other one?

684
00:29:42,660 --> 00:29:43,460
More real guns.

685
00:29:44,580 --> 00:29:45,940
Well, you're canceled.

686
00:29:45,940 --> 00:29:47,220
Ah, shoot.

687
00:29:47,220 --> 00:29:49,060
You're canceled too, Crevin.

688
00:29:49,060 --> 00:29:51,940
Did you guys ever see that movie Wanted where they curve the bullets?

689
00:29:52,500 --> 00:29:54,020
Yeah, I love that play.

690
00:29:54,020 --> 00:29:54,820
Can we make those?

691
00:29:54,820 --> 00:29:55,780
Because that was badass.

692
00:29:56,580 --> 00:29:58,580
Okay, you're back to being CEO.

693
00:29:59,220 --> 00:29:59,860
Fuck yeah.

694
00:30:00,420 --> 00:30:03,380
Angelina Jolie curved it all around town.

695
00:30:03,380 --> 00:30:03,700
Are you-

696
00:30:03,700 --> 00:30:04,500
Can we get her?

697
00:30:04,500 --> 00:30:06,100
Can we get Angelina?

698
00:30:06,100 --> 00:30:07,380
Can we go to the money zone?

699
00:30:18,420 --> 00:30:24,900
I want to talk about MeUndies because MeUndies has a new design that I love so very much.

700
00:30:24,900 --> 00:30:32,260
It is pineapple and you can get pineapple underpants and pineapple socks and wear them

701
00:30:32,260 --> 00:30:36,020
at the same time and feel so cool.

702
00:30:36,740 --> 00:30:40,740
And they have multiple style options that you're going to find one that you love.

703
00:30:40,740 --> 00:30:44,180
They're, you know, they're that coveted micro modal fabric.

704
00:30:44,180 --> 00:30:46,100
It's three times softer than cotton.

705
00:30:46,100 --> 00:30:48,500
Why don't you already have these on your body?

706
00:30:48,500 --> 00:30:49,700
You'll love them.

707
00:30:49,700 --> 00:30:52,020
They have the softest lounge around the planet.

708
00:30:52,020 --> 00:30:54,820
I've got a couple different sets of their sleep pants at this point.

709
00:30:54,820 --> 00:30:56,580
I love them so much.

710
00:30:56,580 --> 00:30:59,300
They even have super comfy onesies at this point.

711
00:30:59,300 --> 00:31:01,460
Yes, that's right, onesies.

712
00:31:01,460 --> 00:31:07,140
You can get 50% off your first pair, free shipping, and 100% satisfaction guarantee

713
00:31:07,140 --> 00:31:10,340
if you go to MeUndies.com slash my brother.

714
00:31:10,340 --> 00:31:13,860
That's MeUndies.com slash my brother.

715
00:31:13,860 --> 00:31:18,500
It specifically says here to say something about the boxer briefs with a fly and you

716
00:31:18,500 --> 00:31:19,940
failed at doing that.

717
00:31:19,940 --> 00:31:25,380
So now I have to step in and say like you slip your bing bong through it and you pee

718
00:31:25,380 --> 00:31:27,140
right through these things.

719
00:31:27,140 --> 00:31:28,820
Okay, now we can move on.

720
00:31:28,820 --> 00:31:30,980
I want to talk about a sponsor too.

721
00:31:30,980 --> 00:31:34,980
It's Bowl and Branch, who I feel like we haven't spoken on in a while.

722
00:31:34,980 --> 00:31:39,540
I'm so glad we get to because every night I love sleeping on my Bowl and Branch sheets

723
00:31:39,540 --> 00:31:41,460
and that's not a bunch of fucking horseshit.

724
00:31:42,660 --> 00:31:44,020
I love these motherfuckers.

725
00:31:44,020 --> 00:31:46,020
Do they have a hole that I can pee through as well?

726
00:31:48,260 --> 00:31:53,220
Everyone has a custom made for your specific genitalia.

727
00:31:53,220 --> 00:31:58,500
Everything Bowl and Branch makes is designed with your comfort in mind from their pure

728
00:31:58,500 --> 00:32:02,580
1000% organic cotton signature soft sheets.

729
00:32:02,580 --> 00:32:09,140
Sheets which start out luxuriously soft and get even softer over time to their cozy throws

730
00:32:09,140 --> 00:32:10,500
to their plush.

731
00:32:10,500 --> 00:32:14,020
Until it disintegrates into little puffs of cotton seeds.

732
00:32:14,020 --> 00:32:14,500
Goodbye.

733
00:32:15,060 --> 00:32:20,340
It's supposed to be 100% cotton and Justin said 1000% and I'm having a very real inside

734
00:32:20,340 --> 00:32:23,140
discussion in my head about whether we're going to get sued over that or not.

735
00:32:23,140 --> 00:32:26,020
Well are we going to get in trouble because I think Justin just suggested that each one

736
00:32:26,020 --> 00:32:29,220
is 10 of them.

737
00:32:29,220 --> 00:32:34,420

744
00:32:46,740 --> 00:32:50,180
Is that a bad name because there's already a thing called a bowl that everybody knows

745
00:32:50,180 --> 00:32:50,580
about?

746
00:32:50,580 --> 00:32:51,220
Sure.

747
00:32:51,220 --> 00:32:54,340
But you have to support them because they need you now.

748
00:32:54,340 --> 00:32:56,020
They need your money to buy a better name.

749
00:32:56,660 --> 00:33:00,980
It's too late to change it back so they're stuck with this and you've got to help them

750
00:33:00,980 --> 00:33:01,620
out.

751
00:33:01,620 --> 00:33:02,900

759
00:33:12,340 --> 00:33:13,300
And I'm Teresa.

760
00:33:13,300 --> 00:33:16,980
And we host One Bad Mother, a comedy podcast about parenting.

761
00:33:16,980 --> 00:33:22,180
Whether you are a parent or just know kids exist in the world, join us each week as we

762
00:33:22,180 --> 00:33:25,060
honestly share what it's like to be a parent.

763
00:33:25,060 --> 00:33:27,380
And then that's how my day starts.

764
00:33:27,380 --> 00:33:27,700
Yeah.

765
00:33:27,700 --> 00:33:28,820
Come on.

766
00:33:28,820 --> 00:33:30,420
I'm so sick of it.

767
00:33:30,420 --> 00:33:32,340
When is that going to be over?

768
00:33:32,340 --> 00:33:34,500
Like, I want it to stop.

769
00:33:34,500 --> 00:33:36,100
Teresa, you're hurting my ears.

770
00:33:37,940 --> 00:33:39,140
I mean, that's it.

771
00:33:39,140 --> 00:33:39,540
Yeah.

772
00:33:39,540 --> 00:33:39,860
No.

773
00:33:39,860 --> 00:33:41,060
I just hate it.

774
00:33:41,060 --> 00:33:42,340
Yeah, I don't blame you.

775
00:33:42,340 --> 00:33:44,020
It sucks.

776
00:33:44,020 --> 00:33:45,140
It really sucks.

777
00:33:45,700 --> 00:33:50,660
So join us each week as we judge less, laugh more, and remind you that you are doing a

778
00:33:50,660 --> 00:33:51,780
great job.

Find us on Maximumfun.org, on Apple Podcasts, or wherever you get your podcasts.

780
00:33:59,460 --> 00:33:59,700
Wow.

781
00:34:01,700 --> 00:34:02,420
I'm going bassy.

782
00:34:05,140 --> 00:34:06,020
Oh, God, that sounds bad.

783
00:34:06,020 --> 00:34:07,140
I want a munch.

784
00:34:07,140 --> 00:34:07,640
Squad.

785
00:34:07,640 --> 00:34:08,140
Squad.

786
00:34:08,140 --> 00:34:11,380
Yeah, digga digga, yeah, yeah, yeah.

787
00:34:11,380 --> 00:34:14,180
I want to munch.

788
00:34:14,180 --> 00:34:14,680
Squad.

789
00:34:15,940 --> 00:34:17,380
Trying to make this one sexier.

790
00:34:17,380 --> 00:34:23,300
This is a segment about brand eating, I guess is one way of putting it.

791
00:34:23,300 --> 00:34:29,540
It's just, it's a segment about the latest and greatest in fast food innovations.

792
00:34:29,540 --> 00:34:34,980
And it's also a segment about how the fast food industry in this country, through press

793
00:34:34,980 --> 00:34:44,820
releases, is taking the English language and our culture and dismantling it piecemeal for

794
00:34:44,820 --> 00:34:45,540
scrap.

795
00:34:45,540 --> 00:34:47,220
There's not even that much left.

796
00:34:47,220 --> 00:34:48,420
They're picking the bones, please.

797
00:34:48,420 --> 00:34:52,100
There's not even that much, thank you, there's not even that much left.

798
00:34:52,740 --> 00:34:54,260
And they are dismantling it.

799
00:34:54,260 --> 00:35:02,500
I have, this one's kind of a contest, and I want to see who is sort of like playing

800
00:35:02,500 --> 00:35:10,260
with fire the most, and who's sort of like most detrimental to language and culture.

801
00:35:10,260 --> 00:35:10,760
Okay.

802
00:35:11,620 --> 00:35:12,120
Okay.

803
00:35:12,120 --> 00:35:19,560
Okay, so the one I will tell you about is Just Egg Partners with Next Level Burger to

804
00:35:19,560 --> 00:35:21,800
create the Brekkie Burger.

805
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:23,720
And that is...

806
00:35:26,120 --> 00:35:28,920
I need you to, there's so many words even in that.

807
00:35:28,920 --> 00:35:30,680
There's a company called Just Egg.

808
00:35:31,240 --> 00:35:32,360
Just Egg.

809
00:35:32,920 --> 00:35:33,800
What do they do?

810
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:37,800
That's a wild ass name for a company, because one, it's not plural.

811
00:35:38,680 --> 00:35:39,640
Just Egg.

812
00:35:39,640 --> 00:35:40,680
Just the one egg.

813
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:41,800
Just Egg.

814
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:44,920
Hey, everybody, this is my new company, Just the One, oh, someone bought it.

815
00:35:44,920 --> 00:35:51,240
Just is the company, and the Just Egg is not eggs.

816
00:35:51,240 --> 00:35:58,920
Twist on you, it's made from 4,400, okay, this is what it says, Just Egg is made from

817
00:35:58,920 --> 00:36:05,560
the 4,400 year old mung bean, amazing to think those are still fresh enough for human consumption,

818
00:36:05,560 --> 00:36:06,600
but here we are.

819
00:36:06,600 --> 00:36:11,560
And the baked patty version used by Next Level Burger has more protein than conventional

820
00:36:11,560 --> 00:36:12,360
chicken eggs.

821
00:36:13,160 --> 00:36:22,360
So this is like a fake eggs with vegan sausage and vegan bacon on a burger.

822
00:36:22,360 --> 00:36:26,280
The thing is called the Brekkie Burger, and I find that highly upsetting.

823
00:36:26,280 --> 00:36:27,080
It's not great.

824
00:36:27,080 --> 00:36:28,360
Obviously, it's third place.

825
00:36:28,360 --> 00:36:28,860
Okay.

826
00:36:29,640 --> 00:36:34,280
I'm more upset by the fact that they make vegan eggs and they call it Just Egg, and

827
00:36:34,280 --> 00:36:41,080
that seems like, it's like, it's just egg, it's not this, it's just egg, Tony, eat it.

828
00:36:41,080 --> 00:36:43,560
Go ahead, just try it, Tony.

829
00:36:43,560 --> 00:36:48,040
The Pizza Hut Cheesy Bite Pizza has returned for a limited time.

830
00:36:48,040 --> 00:36:55,000
It's just in time for summer, and here's the quote, only Pizza Hut can bring you a bold

831
00:36:55,000 --> 00:37:01,800
creation, an epic pizza eating experience like Cheesy Bites Pizza, says Mary Ann Radley,

832
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:05,640
chief brand officer of Pizza Hut, presumably because the technology is trademarked.

833
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:13,480
But anyway, pizza meets party with this all time fan favorite, which lets you and your

834
00:37:13,480 --> 00:37:20,040
friends soak up some much needed vitamin cheese all summer long.

835
00:37:20,040 --> 00:37:26,520
Oh my God, I am so far away from my computer monitor when I record my Bim Bam, and I got

836
00:37:26,520 --> 00:37:29,800
a lot of spit on it from that vitamin cheese.

837
00:37:29,800 --> 00:37:37,480
It's vitamin cheese, which seems like the kind of thing to me that starts out as a joke,

838
00:37:37,480 --> 00:37:40,320
and then in 20 years people are like, well, it's gotta be good for you, it's got a lot

839
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:42,760
of vitamin cheese.

840
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:43,800
It's not bad.

841
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:48,360
So Pizza Hut shits on the floor on June 17th.

842
00:37:48,360 --> 00:37:55,940
Today, no, sorry, yesterday, June 18th as we're recording this, Krispy Kreme announced

843
00:37:55,940 --> 00:38:02,720
their stuffed doughnuts, which will be free on June 22nd, which I'm assuming has passed.

844
00:38:02,720 --> 00:38:09,480
Yes, it has passed, so I'm sorry, but the product is still available, presumably.

845
00:38:09,480 --> 00:38:15,640
Okay, it's round, it's glazed, and for the first time in the US, it's filled.

846
00:38:15,640 --> 00:38:22,320
Introducing a doughnut innovation fans have only imagined until now, Krispy Kreme's new

847
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:24,600
original filled doughnut.

848
00:38:24,600 --> 00:38:32,480
Wait, yeah, but Justin, this one's a ring, okay?

849
00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:35,000
This one's a ring, and it's filled all the way through.

850
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:36,000
Do you understand?

851
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:37,000
Okay.

852
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:38,000
What they've done?

853
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:39,000
No, I'm back, I'm back, I'm back.

854
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:40,000
You're back.

855
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:41,000
You can visualize it.

856
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:46,840
Delivering a new taste experience for the doughnut verse, fuck off, Krispy Kreme's original,

857
00:38:46,840 --> 00:38:50,760
that's my least favorite cinematic universe that will be the most financially successful

858
00:38:50,760 --> 00:38:52,880
is the doughnut verse.

859
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:57,440
Krispy Kreme's original filled is a whole new interpretation of the brand's iconic original

860
00:38:57,440 --> 00:39:01,260
glazed doughnut featuring Krispy Kreme's classic original glazed doughnut.

861
00:39:01,260 --> 00:39:05,320
This new product is initially offered with a choice of two fillings, classic cream and

862
00:39:05,320 --> 00:39:08,320
chocolate cream, providing the perfect bite every time.

863
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:10,120
Okay, are you ready?

864
00:39:10,120 --> 00:39:11,120
Yeah.

865
00:39:11,120 --> 00:39:17,960
This is a quote from Dave Skeena, Chief Marketing Officer for Krispy Kreme Doughnut Corporation.

866
00:39:17,960 --> 00:39:21,680
Krispy Kreme was at the launch of Apollo 11.

867
00:39:21,680 --> 00:39:28,160
Giving fresh doughnuts to Americans witnessing liftoff of this monumental mission.

868
00:39:28,160 --> 00:39:33,280
As America prepares to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the moon landing, we want to

869
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:37,160
give our fans a new taste experience that is out of this world.

870
00:39:37,160 --> 00:39:43,240
We choose to fill our original glazed doughnuts, not because it is easy, but because it is

871
00:39:43,240 --> 00:39:45,240
hard.

872
00:39:45,240 --> 00:39:49,280
No disrespect intended, JFK.

873
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:52,140
Basically, it's not hard.

874
00:39:52,140 --> 00:39:55,800
It's melt in your mouth, delicious.

875
00:39:55,800 --> 00:39:56,800
How could they?

876
00:39:56,800 --> 00:40:01,400
This is the why, why are they doing this for this?

877
00:40:01,400 --> 00:40:04,680
Why do they care about the Apollo 11 mission?

878
00:40:04,680 --> 00:40:07,400
They were there.

879
00:40:07,400 --> 00:40:12,440
They were there and now they did a doughnut that's as good as the moon landing.

880
00:40:12,440 --> 00:40:18,320
It's the 70th anniversary of the beginning of the Manhattan Project and we were there

881
00:40:18,320 --> 00:40:23,000
making sure those scientists had lots of doughnut fuel to blow up the whole earth with.

882
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:27,160
And it's to celebrate, we're going to blow up your mouth with our creamed fuck stuffed

883
00:40:27,160 --> 00:40:28,460
doughnut boys.

884
00:40:28,460 --> 00:40:34,440
Get in here and just start biting everything you see and just wait for nuclear winter courtesy

885
00:40:34,440 --> 00:40:37,200
of your pals at Krispy Kreme.

886
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:40,640
I mean, it's just, it's unfathomable.

887
00:40:40,640 --> 00:40:45,520
You also can't be like, we didn't do it, not because it's easy, but because it is hard.

888
00:40:45,520 --> 00:40:46,520
It's not hard.

889
00:40:46,520 --> 00:40:49,080
Actually, I messed up.

890
00:40:49,080 --> 00:40:50,080
It's not hard.

891
00:40:50,080 --> 00:40:53,800
I just thought it would be so fucking funny if I quoted that beloved dead president that

892
00:40:53,800 --> 00:40:56,280
got shot in Dallas, remember?

893
00:40:56,280 --> 00:40:57,320
We were there too.

894
00:40:57,320 --> 00:40:59,320
We just don't like to brag about that one.

895
00:40:59,320 --> 00:41:03,480
But we were there selling Krispy hot fresh, delicious Krispy Kreme doughnuts that day

896
00:41:03,480 --> 00:41:04,480
too.

897
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:07,540
Everyone remembers JFK getting shot, but what do they not remember?

898
00:41:07,540 --> 00:41:12,160
Your pal Krusty Kreme in the audience passing out all these delicious doughnuts.

899
00:41:12,160 --> 00:41:16,480
God, marketing, advertising doughnuts well spent, huh Krusty Kreme?

900
00:41:16,480 --> 00:41:21,400
If you slow the Zapruder film down and you look at the crowd, they're clearly enjoying

901
00:41:21,400 --> 00:41:25,240
a lot of delicious Krispy Kreme doughnuts.

902
00:41:25,240 --> 00:41:26,240
That's all I'm saying.

903
00:41:26,240 --> 00:41:27,240
Nobody wants to talk about that.

904
00:41:27,240 --> 00:41:31,960
They just want to talk about the grassy knoll and the death of our beloved president.

905
00:41:31,960 --> 00:41:34,520
It's the second, yes, I agree.

906
00:41:34,520 --> 00:41:37,320
That is definitely the most important thing that happened there.

907
00:41:37,320 --> 00:41:43,760
The second most important thing is we were there with doughnuts at that time.

908
00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:48,120
Anyway, these ones are filled with cream now, so we got that going for us which is huge.

909
00:41:48,120 --> 00:41:51,520
Thank God I can finally get a doughnut with cream in it.

910
00:41:51,520 --> 00:41:52,520
But not where you'd expect.

911
00:41:52,520 --> 00:41:58,080
And even less doughnut to eat because they done cut out the middle of it.

912
00:41:58,080 --> 00:42:00,800
Yeah, it's basically a cream hoop with crust.

913
00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:06,760
Let me give you less doughnut for the money and you'll thank me for it.

914
00:42:06,760 --> 00:42:07,760
This shit is thick.

915
00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:09,760
Oh, is this a dummy thick doughnut?

916
00:42:09,760 --> 00:42:12,320
It's a real thick one.

917
00:42:12,320 --> 00:42:14,320
Okay, good.

918
00:42:14,320 --> 00:42:15,320
Do you want a Yahoo though?

919
00:42:15,320 --> 00:42:16,320
Absolutely.

920
00:42:16,320 --> 00:42:18,080
This one's sent in by Brandon.

921
00:42:18,080 --> 00:42:19,080
Thanks Brandon.

922
00:42:19,080 --> 00:42:20,080
It's Yahoo Answers user.

923
00:42:20,080 --> 00:42:21,880
Thanks Brandon.

924
00:42:21,880 --> 00:42:23,440
We don't usually do that, Travis.

925
00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:27,920
I know, but I felt like I wasn't voicing my gratitude enough just in general, but also

926
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:29,360
specifically for Brandon.

927
00:42:29,360 --> 00:42:31,000
So thanks, Brandon.

928
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:34,160
This is from Yahoo Answers user, Penfold, who asks.

929
00:42:34,160 --> 00:42:36,520
Thanks Penfold.

930
00:42:36,520 --> 00:42:40,080
What to do for a pig-themed jazz party?

931
00:42:40,080 --> 00:42:43,520
Huh?

932
00:42:43,520 --> 00:42:46,360
My friend's kid is having a party with a pig theme.

933
00:42:46,360 --> 00:42:47,840
I think she likes them.

934
00:42:47,840 --> 00:42:52,120
They're her fave animal or something, but also it's at a park with jazz music?

935
00:42:52,120 --> 00:42:53,120
What should I-

936
00:42:53,120 --> 00:42:54,120
Stiles Davis.

937
00:42:54,120 --> 00:42:55,120
What?

938
00:42:55,120 --> 00:42:56,120
What?

939
00:42:56,120 --> 00:43:00,140
Like a pigsty, but it's Stiles Davis.

940
00:43:00,140 --> 00:43:01,200
What should I expect?

941
00:43:01,200 --> 00:43:02,440
What gift will fit the theme?

942
00:43:02,440 --> 00:43:03,840
Help, I really want to impress her.

943
00:43:03,840 --> 00:43:04,840
She's really sweet.

944
00:43:04,840 --> 00:43:08,240
Update, the kid is 10 years old and it's definitely not Peppa Pig themed.

945
00:43:08,240 --> 00:43:09,480
I know she hates that.

946
00:43:09,480 --> 00:43:13,480
Boy, that's a cool brain that this child has.

947
00:43:13,480 --> 00:43:17,120
I love pigs, but not the famous one that the children enjoy.

948
00:43:17,120 --> 00:43:18,120
Not that bastardization.

949
00:43:18,120 --> 00:43:20,800
That's not how pigs really act.

950
00:43:20,800 --> 00:43:21,800
Pigs don't live in houses.

951
00:43:21,800 --> 00:43:22,800
Like classic pigs.

952
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:23,800
Yeah.

953
00:43:23,800 --> 00:43:26,320
Roll around some slop, you fucking narc.

954
00:43:26,320 --> 00:43:27,320
I like frogs.

955
00:43:27,320 --> 00:43:29,120
No, not fucking Kermit.

956
00:43:29,120 --> 00:43:33,800
He does not live in a pond, except in that one movie when he does.

957
00:43:33,800 --> 00:43:34,800
Update two, I'm freaking out.

958
00:43:34,800 --> 00:43:37,360
I think my friend's kid wants me to do karaoke too?

959
00:43:37,360 --> 00:43:40,160
Are there any jazz songs about pigs?

960
00:43:40,160 --> 00:43:42,640
Blue styes.

961
00:43:42,640 --> 00:43:46,400
You just did stye twice.

962
00:43:46,400 --> 00:43:47,400
You just did stye.

963
00:43:47,400 --> 00:43:51,200
I don't know of any jazz songs that contain something that rhymes with oink.

964
00:43:51,200 --> 00:43:53,400
I don't know what to tell you.

965
00:43:53,400 --> 00:43:55,640
List all the jazz songs you know right now.

966
00:43:55,640 --> 00:43:56,640
Blue skies.

967
00:43:56,640 --> 00:43:57,640
Let's see.

968
00:43:57,640 --> 00:44:00,540
End of list.

969
00:44:00,540 --> 00:44:04,300
In a Sentimental Mood by Duke Ellington, of course.

970
00:44:04,300 --> 00:44:08,240
You just Googled jazz songs and that's the first result on Google?

971
00:44:08,240 --> 00:44:09,840
You're reading them in order.

972
00:44:09,840 --> 00:44:10,840
How could you?

973
00:44:10,840 --> 00:44:11,840
Wait.

974
00:44:11,840 --> 00:44:13,020
Goodbye Pork Pie Hat by Charles Mingus?

975
00:44:13,020 --> 00:44:14,720
Is that close enough?

976
00:44:14,720 --> 00:44:19,040
That one writes itself.

977
00:44:19,040 --> 00:44:24,480
But that's really more about Charles just throwing his hat away and being very sad about

978
00:44:24,480 --> 00:44:25,480
it.

979
00:44:25,480 --> 00:44:26,780
It's not so much about the pork.

980
00:44:26,780 --> 00:44:27,840
Pig land.

981
00:44:27,840 --> 00:44:30,200
It's like bird land.

982
00:44:30,200 --> 00:44:32,880
So what should I do for my pig themed jazz party?

983
00:44:32,880 --> 00:44:36,580
The kid likes pigs, but the park is jazz, I guess.

984
00:44:36,580 --> 00:44:37,580
Let me tell you this.

985
00:44:37,580 --> 00:44:40,940
First, right off the bat, don't bring any kind of pork food.

986
00:44:40,940 --> 00:44:42,400
That's a misstep.

987
00:44:42,400 --> 00:44:46,460
Because you're going to think, oh this is fun because it's like pig, but if the kid

988
00:44:46,460 --> 00:44:53,960
likes pigs, my bet is that that does not extend to consuming them in a fun way.

989
00:44:53,960 --> 00:45:01,100
Henry's very into superheroes right now, but if I brought him a nice flank cut of Iron

990
00:45:01,100 --> 00:45:05,360
Man meat, he would be pretty PO'd, I bet.

991
00:45:05,360 --> 00:45:06,360
Yes.

992
00:45:06,360 --> 00:45:11,620
Bebe is really into like petting zoos and aquariums, and I fear the day when she puts

993
00:45:11,620 --> 00:45:14,080
two and two together.

994
00:45:14,080 --> 00:45:18,640
Get the giant keyboard from Big.

995
00:45:18,640 --> 00:45:21,320
Get a pig.

996
00:45:21,320 --> 00:45:26,520
Sprinkle corn on the piano.

997
00:45:26,520 --> 00:45:30,840
And then that pig is going to play jazz.

998
00:45:30,840 --> 00:45:36,680
I mean, it will be a very avant garde form of jazz, but it is going to be jazz, and it's

999
00:45:36,680 --> 00:45:39,720
going to be hard to deny it as jazz.

1000
00:45:39,720 --> 00:45:41,960
Now get a stand up bass.

1001
00:45:41,960 --> 00:45:44,040
Put some corn on it.

1002
00:45:44,040 --> 00:45:48,280
That pig's going to play some jazz on a stand up bass.

1003
00:45:48,280 --> 00:45:49,280
Yours is dumb.

1004
00:45:49,280 --> 00:45:50,280
A trumpet.

1005
00:45:50,280 --> 00:45:52,920
Travis, that's the dumbest thing I've ever heard.

1006
00:45:52,920 --> 00:45:57,840
It's got to be creamed corn that you sort of slop down the fretboard, or else it's not

1007
00:45:57,840 --> 00:46:00,240
going to stick.

1008
00:46:00,240 --> 00:46:02,240
Speak before you speak.

1009
00:46:02,240 --> 00:46:08,360
If you don't have any corn, you can use dead cowboys, because that's what they do in Deadwood.

1010
00:46:08,360 --> 00:46:12,720
That's the only thing I know that pigs really love eating, is dead cowboys.

1011
00:46:12,720 --> 00:46:14,160
What would you get?

1012
00:46:14,160 --> 00:46:15,160
Maybe some peppa pig?

1013
00:46:15,160 --> 00:46:16,160
No, fuck.

1014
00:46:16,160 --> 00:46:17,160
No.

1015
00:46:17,160 --> 00:46:18,160
Shit.

1016
00:46:18,160 --> 00:46:19,160
Hates that one.

1017
00:46:19,160 --> 00:46:20,360
Maybe a pet pig.

1018
00:46:20,360 --> 00:46:24,160
Maybe just a big ol' pig that they are now in charge of.

1019
00:46:24,160 --> 00:46:26,360
That does autographs and photo ops.

1020
00:46:26,360 --> 00:46:32,960
Oh, get him a pet pig, but name the pig, you know, Herbie Hancock or something sweet like

1021
00:46:32,960 --> 00:46:33,960
that.

1022
00:46:33,960 --> 00:46:34,960
Or Stiles Davis.

1023
00:46:34,960 --> 00:46:38,160
That one's still bad.

1024
00:46:38,160 --> 00:46:39,160
Let's do another question.

1025
00:46:39,160 --> 00:46:42,960
Did you guys know Shaq just started buying up Papa John's's?

1026
00:46:42,960 --> 00:46:43,960
Huh?

1027
00:46:43,960 --> 00:46:44,960
This is unrelated.

1028
00:46:44,960 --> 00:46:53,480
It's not only much government, did you guys know that Shaq just started?

1029
00:46:53,480 --> 00:46:56,840
Papa John's is like, we are in this huge chamber.

1030
00:46:56,840 --> 00:46:59,160
We cannot get out because of the bad John's.

1031
00:46:59,160 --> 00:47:00,160
Everyone hated.

1032
00:47:00,160 --> 00:47:04,600
And they went to Shaq and they said, Shaq, if you say nice things about Papa John's,

1033
00:47:04,600 --> 00:47:08,880
we'll give you $4 million and 87,000 shares of stock.

1034
00:47:08,880 --> 00:47:11,280
And also some Papa John's's.

1035
00:47:11,280 --> 00:47:14,760
So he just started buying up Papa John's's.

1036
00:47:14,760 --> 00:47:15,760
And he just started-

1037
00:47:15,760 --> 00:47:21,640
Justin DeFleur's girl is actually Papa's John.

1038
00:47:21,640 --> 00:47:23,880
He just started acquiring them.

1039
00:47:23,880 --> 00:47:26,640
Like wild, he just started buying up Papa John's's.

1040
00:47:26,640 --> 00:47:33,640
There's a Papa John's in Atlanta where the number to get it is 470-444-Shaq, nice.

1041
00:47:33,640 --> 00:47:34,640
Call that number right now.

1042
00:47:34,640 --> 00:47:35,640
That's going to give you a Papa John's.

1043
00:47:35,640 --> 00:47:37,800
They are probably getting a few calls.

1044
00:47:37,800 --> 00:47:41,480
So please only call if you're in the area.

1045
00:47:41,480 --> 00:47:45,560
But this is like, he bought seven of them.

1046
00:47:45,560 --> 00:47:48,480
And it's like, these are the good ones.

1047
00:47:48,480 --> 00:47:53,080
These are the ones that are okay because Shaq owns them.

1048
00:47:53,080 --> 00:47:54,920
These are Shaq's Papa's John's.

1049
00:47:54,920 --> 00:47:57,600
I would much rather eat at a Papa Shaq's.

1050
00:47:57,600 --> 00:48:01,760
Papa Shaq's Slam Dunk City, I would be there in a fucking heartbeat.

1051
00:48:01,760 --> 00:48:09,020
If they renamed the restaurant to Papa Shaq's, I would frequent it again, probably.

1052
00:48:09,020 --> 00:48:13,120
There is a Papa John's on Houger Boulevard here in Huntington.

1053
00:48:13,120 --> 00:48:16,800
And you know how they have like the sign out front with like where they put the specials

1054
00:48:16,800 --> 00:48:19,000
and the deals.

1055
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:24,000
The one in Huntington has had the same message for the past eight months and in huge letters

1056
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:27,440
it just says, locally owned.

1057
00:48:27,440 --> 00:48:30,400
We will not bend the knee to Lord Shaq.

1058
00:48:30,400 --> 00:48:34,720
Well, I think it's part of reference to Papa Shaq.

1059
00:48:34,720 --> 00:48:35,720
To shitty John.

1060
00:48:35,720 --> 00:48:38,720
Not to Shaq, their new savior.

1061
00:48:38,720 --> 00:48:44,480
I thought he was saying, this is the house of John.

1062
00:48:44,480 --> 00:48:46,920
We are unbent and unbroken.

1063
00:48:46,920 --> 00:48:50,600
Do not even approach us with your golden coins, Shaq.

1064
00:48:50,600 --> 00:48:57,080
We know you have many of them from the movie, Kazam or Shazam, whichever it was.

1065
00:48:57,080 --> 00:48:59,680
Shaq owns an Atlanta Krispy Kreme.

1066
00:48:59,680 --> 00:49:05,920
In Las Vegas, he owns a fast casual restaurant called Big Chicken, a fine dining place in

1067
00:49:05,920 --> 00:49:10,600
LA, and he once ran 27 Five Guys franchises.

1068
00:49:10,600 --> 00:49:13,800
Wow, that's 135 guys.

1069
00:49:13,800 --> 00:49:16,640
Dammit Travis, you did the math so much faster than I did.

1070
00:49:16,640 --> 00:49:19,720
Yep, I was a mathlete.

1071
00:49:19,720 --> 00:49:23,840
Just real quick, the perfect name for Jazz Pig is Fats Waller.

1072
00:49:23,840 --> 00:49:25,840
Yeah, pretty good, pretty good.

1073
00:49:25,840 --> 00:49:26,840
Thank you.

1074
00:49:26,840 --> 00:49:34,320
The press release says, broadly it could ignite outside interest to garner additional franchisees

1075
00:49:34,320 --> 00:49:35,880
into the system.

1076
00:49:35,880 --> 00:49:40,480
What, how, okay, how are you making life choices where you're like, I know what I'm gonna do

1077
00:49:40,480 --> 00:49:43,560
for a living, open the restaurant that Shaq has some of.

1078
00:49:43,560 --> 00:49:49,440
No, no, I've heard a lot of bad press about Papa John's, wait, what's that?

1079
00:49:49,440 --> 00:49:52,680
Shaq bought some, huh?

1080
00:49:52,680 --> 00:49:54,680
Just rename it Papa Shaq's.

1081
00:49:54,680 --> 00:50:05,120
Oh, okay, I'll take two, two Papa Shaq's please, with extra shakaroni.

1082
00:50:05,120 --> 00:50:10,520
We've got all the food you want, we do have shakaroni.

1083
00:50:10,520 --> 00:50:11,520
Shakaroni and cheese.

1084
00:50:11,520 --> 00:50:15,320
We've got shakaroni and cheese, we've got shakaroni salad.

1085
00:50:15,320 --> 00:50:22,760
It's an expansive, expansive side dish menu that Shaq himself insisted on, and also we

1086
00:50:22,760 --> 00:50:25,000
do sell basketballs now, which is wild.

1087
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:29,760
Make sure you dip all that shit in our free throw stink water, which is what he has renamed

1088
00:50:29,760 --> 00:50:31,760
the garlic dipping sauce, unfortunately.

1089
00:50:31,760 --> 00:50:37,560
We begged him not to, but he sold out, he's a genius.

1090
00:50:37,560 --> 00:50:41,840
Wow, this whole time we shouldn't have called it free throw stink water.

1091
00:50:41,840 --> 00:50:48,400
I can't even know that's stink water.

1092
00:50:48,400 --> 00:50:52,200
Just call it Papa Shaq's, please.

1093
00:50:52,200 --> 00:50:56,600
I can't even do Papa John's shit in Munch Squad anymore, because there's like the preamble

1094
00:50:56,600 --> 00:51:04,200
it would require when you use up all of our hilarious movie box office joke time.

1095
00:51:04,200 --> 00:51:10,000
So if it was just called Papa Shaq's, one, all those would become 17% funnier fucking

1096
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:11,000
instantly.

1097
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:14,320
And we could all feel good about eating at Papa Shaq's.

1098
00:51:14,320 --> 00:51:18,280
Yeah, buy up Jimmy John's while you're at it, and call it Shaqy Shaq's.

1099
00:51:18,280 --> 00:51:19,280
Shaqy Shaq's.

1100
00:51:19,280 --> 00:51:21,600
He's on the board, by the way.

1101
00:51:21,600 --> 00:51:23,840
He's on the board of directors.

1102
00:51:23,840 --> 00:51:25,320
Of Jemethy Johns?

1103
00:51:25,320 --> 00:51:28,120
Yeah, of Papa John's.

1104
00:51:28,120 --> 00:51:31,480
One of the people that sits at the big table to make the big decisions about whether or

1105
00:51:31,480 --> 00:51:35,800
not to call it Papa Shaq's is Shaq himself, he will almost certainly be the tallest person

1106
00:51:35,800 --> 00:51:37,680
in the room.

1107
00:51:37,680 --> 00:51:41,520
Certainly he can take the saucy throne for himself.

1108
00:51:41,520 --> 00:51:51,720
There is a vacuum of leadership, a vacuum of power that Shaq is prepared to leap into.

1109
00:51:51,720 --> 00:51:56,000
The ones that he owns, there are size 22 footprints at the front door, so you can kind of see

1110
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:59,720
how you stack up to Shaq.

1111
00:51:59,720 --> 00:52:06,400
When the pizza chain announced his board placement in March, chief executive Steve Ritchie said,

1112
00:52:06,400 --> 00:52:09,520
organizational decision makers cheered.

1113
00:52:09,520 --> 00:52:17,360
Well, certainly, what other response are you going to have to Shaq, Shaq has thrown in

1114
00:52:17,360 --> 00:52:18,760
his lot with us.

1115
00:52:18,760 --> 00:52:23,960
The powerful man is here to save our terrible pizza.

1116
00:52:23,960 --> 00:52:28,560
Wicked John is gone and Shaq is here to deliver us.

1117
00:52:28,560 --> 00:52:33,400
He demands fealty is the one thing about it, is that he demands your fealty.

1118
00:52:33,400 --> 00:52:41,440
Please Shaq, act as our shield, our Shaq shield O'Neal.

1119
00:52:41,440 --> 00:52:46,760
Part of the agreement is that Shaq will be made available for 60 minutes of total interview

1120
00:52:46,760 --> 00:52:52,520
time promoting Papa John's, he will be trained ahead of time for each talk.

1121
00:52:52,520 --> 00:52:58,880
Wait, so there's one hour of Shaq spread across all of time that they could use.

1122
00:52:58,880 --> 00:53:04,000
Shaq just got a little chest clock, a little speed chest clock, he's like, okay, go.

1123
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:07,920
Shaq, I'd like to start off talking to you about your career.

1124
00:53:07,920 --> 00:53:11,000
Fuck no, we've only got 60 minutes, talk about pizza.

1125
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:13,960
What is it about pizza that drew you to Papa John's?

1126
00:53:13,960 --> 00:53:17,960
Pizza's awesome, I've said that in interviews before, you've just wasted 14 seconds of my

1127
00:53:17,960 --> 00:53:18,960
precious interview time.

1128
00:53:18,960 --> 00:53:19,960
Next question.

1129
00:53:19,960 --> 00:53:25,120
It's wild guys, for the affiliation announcement between Shaq and Papa John's, Shaq will provide

1130
00:53:25,120 --> 00:53:31,000
business and consumer PR interviews, including two broadcast TV and three print or online

1131
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:33,160
media interviews in New York City.

1132
00:53:33,160 --> 00:53:37,600
Two approved photos for release, one at a Papa John's restaurant and one making pizza

1133
00:53:37,600 --> 00:53:38,600
with Richie.

1134
00:53:38,600 --> 00:53:43,800
A social media post, a social media post, a quote for a press release, a business headshot

1135
00:53:43,800 --> 00:53:48,080
and business bio, that's what Shaq is providing.

1136
00:53:48,080 --> 00:53:52,760
Shaq's to be included in that Papa John's heat.

1137
00:53:52,760 --> 00:53:58,880
Just to get a little bit of Shaq's light to shine on this terrible pizza person.

1138
00:53:58,880 --> 00:53:59,880
Who's Richie?

1139
00:53:59,880 --> 00:54:04,920
Like the guy who runs, Steve Richie's, chief executive, Papa John's.

1140
00:54:04,920 --> 00:54:08,600
And he had to put in a contract, I want to make pizza with Shaq.

1141
00:54:08,600 --> 00:54:10,120
I bet that that was the, that was-

1142
00:54:10,120 --> 00:54:11,880
It did add in the contract.

1143
00:54:11,880 --> 00:54:17,880
Yes, we can assume safely, Steve Richie, chief executive of Papa John's, put into a written

1144
00:54:17,880 --> 00:54:22,240
document that part of the deal is you have to make pizza with me, Shaq.

1145
00:54:22,240 --> 00:54:23,240
And that's how I met Shaq.

1146
00:54:23,240 --> 00:54:26,160
They have to take one picture of it.

1147
00:54:26,160 --> 00:54:27,160
You promised.

1148
00:54:27,160 --> 00:54:28,160
You have to be my best friend now.

1149
00:54:28,160 --> 00:54:31,160
You promised to come make pizza with me, Shaq.

1150
00:54:31,160 --> 00:54:32,160
You promised.

1151
00:54:32,160 --> 00:54:37,920
Yeah, but you can have one of my tickets for the big concert, Shaq, but you got to come

1152
00:54:37,920 --> 00:54:40,680
over to my house and be my friend for the day.

1153
00:54:40,680 --> 00:54:46,080
All right, so Shaq owns Seven Papa John's.

1154
00:54:46,080 --> 00:54:49,440
Folks, that's going to do it for us here on my brother, my brother and me.

1155
00:54:49,440 --> 00:54:52,320
We hope you've enjoyed yourself.

1156
00:54:52,320 --> 00:54:54,520
Please only eat at Shaq's Papa John's.

1157
00:54:54,520 --> 00:54:55,520
Don't get it twisted.

1158
00:54:55,520 --> 00:55:01,480
The brand is still treacherous, but the ones that Shaq owns are probably okay, I guess.

1159
00:55:01,480 --> 00:55:03,480
I don't actually know how that all works.

1160
00:55:03,480 --> 00:55:05,600
I'm not a scientist.

1161
00:55:05,600 --> 00:55:09,000
You bet I'll stick with Domino's, the shadowy cabal that runs that place.

1162
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:12,760
It's not been uncovered for its evil yet, so go for it.

1163
00:55:12,760 --> 00:55:15,080
Let's see.

1164
00:55:15,080 --> 00:55:16,080
What do we need to-

1165
00:55:16,080 --> 00:55:17,080
I got a couple things I want to tell people.

1166
00:55:17,080 --> 00:55:18,080
Housekeeping, Travis.

1167
00:55:18,080 --> 00:55:19,080
Yes, please.

1168
00:55:19,080 --> 00:55:20,080
Can I?

1169
00:55:20,080 --> 00:55:21,080
First off-

1170
00:55:21,080 --> 00:55:22,080
Please, go ahead.

1171
00:55:22,080 --> 00:55:23,080
We got our book two are coming up.

1172
00:55:23,080 --> 00:55:27,360
It's for the Adventure Zone graphic novel book two, Murder on the Rockport Limited.

1173
00:55:27,360 --> 00:55:36,080
We're going to be in on July 16th, Justin and Griffin will be in New York City and dad

1174
00:55:36,080 --> 00:55:40,100
and I will be in Portland, but I'm pretty sure the Portland show is already sold out.

1175
00:55:40,100 --> 00:55:45,480
And then on July 17th, Justin and Griffin will be in Austin, Texas, and dad and I will

1176
00:55:45,480 --> 00:55:47,640
be in Los Angeles.

1177
00:55:47,640 --> 00:55:52,220
Oh, and I should mention Carrie Peach, our amazing artist, is going to be at the New

1178
00:55:52,220 --> 00:55:56,760
York show on the 16th with Justin and Griffin.

1179
00:55:56,760 --> 00:56:03,220
And listen, that LA show isn't selling as much as we would like.

1180
00:56:03,220 --> 00:56:08,140
Maybe because it's like a day before San Diego Comic Con, we don't know.

1181
00:56:08,140 --> 00:56:11,600
But if you have friends in LA that like the show, tell them to get tickets.

1182
00:56:11,600 --> 00:56:13,840
I think it's just they're all jocks, you know?

1183
00:56:13,840 --> 00:56:18,480
And then they're all just such jocky, you know, cool kids in LA.

1184
00:56:18,480 --> 00:56:25,040
And then on the 19th, we are doing a book tour show in San Diego during San Diego Comic

1185
00:56:25,040 --> 00:56:26,140
Con at the Balboa.

1186
00:56:26,140 --> 00:56:29,940
And then the day after that, on the 20th, we are going to do an Adventure Zone live

1187
00:56:29,940 --> 00:56:32,040
show at San Diego Comic Con.

1188
00:56:32,040 --> 00:56:36,800
And you can get tickets for all of that if you go to McElroy.family and click on tours,

1189
00:56:36,800 --> 00:56:42,360
as well as other upcoming tour shows at the end of August, we're going to be in Atlanta

1190
00:56:42,360 --> 00:56:43,360
and Orlando.

1191
00:56:43,360 --> 00:56:45,360
Get your tickets for that.

1192
00:56:45,360 --> 00:56:49,040
Also want to tell people, we have some new amazing merch up there.

1193
00:56:49,040 --> 00:56:53,040
We're trying to add new merch up every month.

1194
00:56:53,040 --> 00:56:55,640
So if you haven't checked in a while, go to McElroyMerch.com.

1195
00:56:55,640 --> 00:57:03,360
Oh, and before I forget, speaking of the book, that comes out July, I believe 17th.

1196
00:57:03,360 --> 00:57:09,000
So if you haven't pre-ordered a copy yet, go to TheAdventureZoneComic.com, pre-order

1197
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:14,440
that and go ahead and, I'm very proud of it and I just want you all to see it.

1198
00:57:14,440 --> 00:57:17,640
So pre-order it and you'll like it a lot, I promise.

1199
00:57:17,640 --> 00:57:19,460
I can't do any more of these.

1200
00:57:19,460 --> 00:57:22,880
So thanks to John Roderick and the Long Winters for the use of our theme song, It's a Departure

1201
00:57:22,880 --> 00:57:24,840
off the album, Putting the Days to Bed.

1202
00:57:24,840 --> 00:57:26,240
I highly recommend you get it.

1203
00:57:26,240 --> 00:57:31,960
The tunes are great and also the disc can't be burned or melted in any way.

1204
00:57:31,960 --> 00:57:35,760
The disc is fully heat resistant and you can take that to the bank.

1205
00:57:35,760 --> 00:57:37,920
Thanks also to Maximum Fun for having us on the network.

1206
00:57:37,920 --> 00:57:41,520
They have all kinds of great shows on there like Switchblade Sisters and Beef and Dairy

1207
00:57:41,520 --> 00:57:47,720
Network and Judge John Hodgman and Jordan Jesse Goh and a bunch more at MaximumFun.org

1208

1209
00:57:51,480 --> 00:57:52,480
Anything else?

1210
00:57:52,480 --> 00:57:53,480
I think that's it.

1211
00:57:53,480 --> 00:57:54,480
I think that'll do it.

1212
00:57:54,480 --> 00:57:55,480
Okay, here's that final Yahoo.

1213
00:57:55,480 --> 00:57:57,080
It was sent in by Adrian Cowles.

1214
00:57:57,080 --> 00:57:58,840
Thanks Adrian, it's Yahoo Answers user.

1215
00:57:58,840 --> 00:58:09,880
They're anonymous, so I'm going to call them Zippy asks, does it seem like ticklish feet

1216
00:58:09,880 --> 00:58:13,720
are less common now than they were 40 years ago?

1217
00:58:13,720 --> 00:58:14,720
Who?

1218
00:58:14,720 --> 00:58:18,600
My name is Justin McElroy.

I'm Griffin McElroy.

1221

This has been my brother, my brother and me, kiss your dad's square on the lips.

1222
00:58:42,120 --> 00:58:43,120
Maximumfun.org.

1223
00:58:43,120 --> 00:58:44,600

1226
00:58:46,800 --> 00:58:51,200
Hey, if you like your podcast to be focused and well researched and your podcast host

1227
00:58:51,200 --> 00:58:55,280
to be uncharismatic, unhorny strangers who have no interest in horses, then this is not

1228
00:58:55,280 --> 00:58:56,280
the podcast for you.

1229
00:58:56,280 --> 00:58:58,520
Yeah, and what's your deal?

1230
00:58:58,520 --> 00:58:59,520
I'm Emily.

1231
00:58:59,520 --> 00:59:00,520
I'm Lisa.

1232
00:59:00,520 --> 00:59:03,940
Our show is called Baby Geniuses and its hosts are horny adult idiots.

1233
00:59:03,940 --> 00:59:06,920
We discover weird Wikipedia pages every episode.

1234
00:59:06,920 --> 00:59:09,180
We discuss institutional misogyny.

1235
00:59:09,180 --> 00:59:12,980
We ask each other the dumbest questions and our listeners won't stop sending us pictures

1236
00:59:12,980 --> 00:59:13,980
of their butts.

1237
00:59:13,980 --> 00:59:16,760
We haven't asked them to stop, but they also aren't stopping.

1238
00:59:16,760 --> 00:59:46,720
Join us on Baby Geniuses every other week on Maximumfun.org.
