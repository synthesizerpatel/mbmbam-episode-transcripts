1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,040
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:06,040 --> 00:00:11,440
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:16,840
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there will know how

4
00:00:16,840 --> 00:00:21,120
cool they are for listening.

5
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:30,720
What's up, you cool baby?

6
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:51,640
Oh, hello.

7
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:52,640
Did you start the thing?

8
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:54,520
Yeah, no, I started the thing.

9
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:55,800
The thing is going.

10
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:56,800
This is it.

11
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:57,800
We're in it now.

12
00:00:57,800 --> 00:00:58,800
We're in the shit.

13
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:00,320
We're in the part that the people paid the money for.

14
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:04,520
Chilean miners emerging from the ground.

15
00:01:04,520 --> 00:01:12,440
We are here with you, the podcast viewing public, to sell our wares.

16
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:13,440
What's on offer today?

17
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:14,440
Podcast.

18
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:15,440
Podcast.

19
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:17,120
Podcast for sale.

20
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:18,120
And honey.

21
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:19,120
I made honey.

22
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:20,120
I figured it out.

23
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:21,120
He made it himself.

24
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:24,680
Welcome to My Brother, My Brother, Me, and Advice Show for the modern era.

25
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:30,440
I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy.

26
00:01:30,440 --> 00:01:31,440
I tickled you, huh?

27
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:34,400
Because it's the name of the shit and then it was your name.

28
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:41,080
I'm your middle brother, Travis McElroy.

29
00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:43,240
And I'm your sweet baby brother, Griffin McElroy.

30
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:44,800
All right.

31
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:46,360
That's fine.

32
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:47,360
All right.

33
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:48,360
That's fine.

34
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:49,360
We get it.

35
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:53,240
Thank you all for joining us here live at the PlayStation Theater.

36
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:55,600
That's the name of the place.

37
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:56,600
It's the name of the theater.

38
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:57,600
It's the PlayStation Theater.

39
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:00,080
That's not a clever bit we came up with.

40
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:01,080
We do have some stuff.

41
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:02,080
We're super excited to be here.

42
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:07,840
It's a nice place, centrally located right across from Guy Fieri's shit store.

43
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:08,840
His whole thing?

44
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:09,840
His whole...

45
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:12,760
As Fieri watches overall.

46
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:16,400
His chubby museum.

47
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:17,400
But it is the PlayStation Theater.

48
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:20,400
I thought it was a museum of the swang.

49
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:21,400
No.

50
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:22,400
It is the PlayStation Theater.

51
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:23,400
All right.

52
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:24,400
We got some stuff out of the way.

53
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:25,400
And just the first thing is...

54
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:26,400
Yo, fuck Xbox.

55
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:27,400
Right?

56
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:28,400
Yeah.

57
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:34,280
The whole fucking family, man.

58
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:36,120
The first Xbox, Xbox One.

59
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:39,600
You can't call it Xbox One again.

60
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:40,600
Xbox 360.

61
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:44,040
Sounds like you skipped 359 of them, idiot.

62
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:45,040
Boom.

63
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:46,040
Boom.

64
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:47,040
Cameo.

65
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:48,040
Suck my dick.

66
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:49,040
Blink's a time sweeper.

67
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:50,040
Suck my dick.

68
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:51,040
Fuck off, Blink's a time sweeper.

69
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:52,040
You got nothing.

70
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:53,040
Suck my dick.

71
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:54,040
Suck my dick.

72
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:55,040
Suck my dick.

73
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:56,040
I don't know any platform exclusive games.

74
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:57,040
But yeah, fuck them.

75
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:58,040
Halo.

76
00:02:58,040 --> 00:02:59,040
Halo.

77
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:00,040
Reach around my butt and grab my balls.

78
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:01,040
Yeah.

79
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:02,040
Fuck Xbox.

80
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:03,040
Fuck Xbox.

81
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:04,040
Uh-oh.

82
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:05,040
Who's that?

83
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:06,040
Over the horizon.

84
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:07,040
It's Nintendo.

85
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:08,040
Fuck you guys, too.

86
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:09,040
Yeah.

87
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:10,040
Luigi can suck my balls.

88
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:11,040
Okay.

89
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:12,040
That's good.

90
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:13,040
You know what Nintendo thinks.

91
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:14,040
Now, I will say this.

92
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:15,040
Thank you.

93
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:16,040
I will say this, though.

94
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:17,040
Yeah.

95
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:18,040
Backstage.

96
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:22,960
I got smoked out by Crash Bandicoot.

97
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:23,960
That dude fucking rules.

98
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:24,960
He's so cool and chill.

99
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:25,960
He's so fucking cool and chill.

100
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:26,960
And who lit the spliff?

101
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:27,960
Spyro the dragon.

102
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:28,960
Spyro the dragon did it.

103
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:29,960
Of course he did.

104
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:30,960
The reason I broke up...

105
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:31,960
Did I say lit the spliff?

106
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:32,960
How old am I?

107
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:42,120
The reason I broke up when I was introduced to myself is I was thinking about how just

108
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:49,280
a second ago Griffin told us, as he has told us before every live show we've ever done

109
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:50,280
in our lives...

110
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:51,280
Okay.

111
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:52,280
This is gonna make me sound terrible.

112
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:53,280
This is...

113
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:55,320
I told you that in confidence, obviously.

114
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:56,320
Okay.

115
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:59,400
What he said was, aw, they horny for this one.

116
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:00,400
Now, there is...

117
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:01,400
Listen.

118
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:02,400
Listen.

119
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:03,400
Now, listen, though.

120
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:04,400
No, listen, though, for real.

121
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:05,400
Listen.

122
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:06,400
Listen.

123
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:07,400
Listen.

124
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:08,400
Listen.

125
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:09,400
Listen.

126
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:10,400
Listen.

127
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:11,400
Listen.

128
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:12,400
Listen.

129
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:13,400
Listen.

130
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:14,400
Listen.

131
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:15,400
Listen.

132
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:16,400
Listen.

133
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:17,400
It's mind over matter.

134
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:18,400
I'm extremely nervous.

135
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:19,400
I get so scared back there.

136
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:20,400
Well, that's the old saying.

137
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:25,040
If you're nervous, just picture everyone in the crowd horny.

138
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:26,040
Just for this...

139
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:27,880
Just for this one.

140
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:28,880
Just for this one?

141
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:29,880
Just for this one.

142
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:30,880
Just for this one.

143
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:34,760
I believe you also use the term wet and wild.

144
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:37,280
That's just in reference to this dance that we're gonna be doing up here.

145
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:38,280
Okay.

146
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:41,680
That's a lot of fun falls we've been practicing.

147
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:47,160
I want to say you all are very, very special tonight.

148
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:53,240
Not just because you're here, but because you will also be the first human beings to

149
00:04:53,240 --> 00:05:00,840
hear us say out loud that we are doing a television show in the near future.

150
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:03,520
Yeah.

151
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:14,320
So here's the thing.

152
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:15,320
That's good.

153
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:16,320
The house lights are good.

154
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:18,520
You can bring the stage lights even down a little bit, help me out with the glare.

155
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:19,520
Here's the thing.

156
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:21,320
It's coming next year.

157
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:23,640
And here's the other thing we're...

158
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:25,040
This is true.

159
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:29,960
We're filming it in Huntington, West Virginia.

160
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:34,720
So I guess my question, and I can't see you guys right now, but I'm trusting you're still

161
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:35,720
there.

162
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:36,720
My question is this.

163
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:40,880
Are you all horny for this one?

164
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:47,560
So that is gonna be available on CISO TV, who we are of course big fans of.

165
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:48,800
Thank you so much.

166
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:50,800
Don't wait to subscribe to CISO.

167
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:51,800
Do it right now.

168
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:53,700
They got so much better stuff.

169
00:05:53,700 --> 00:05:57,320
You could right now leave the theater and I think go watch Hidden America, which is

170
00:05:57,320 --> 00:06:00,040
probably gonna be better than whatever we put on up here.

171
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:03,640
They're also the first company that we went to and they didn't immediately see what we

172
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:07,480
look like and we're like, no.

173
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:08,480
Absolutely not.

174
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:09,480
No.

175
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:12,200
You can't.

176
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:13,200
Not on TV.

177
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:14,200
No.

178
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:15,200
Wait.

179
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:17,000
With your face and everything?

180
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,960
You realize this is the bigger screen, right?

181
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:22,360
Not the computer one or the iPad one, the one that people hold.

182
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:27,440
And we looked into that truth about cats and dogs technology that they did in the movie

183
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:29,240
where I haven't seen it.

184
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:32,400
I'm gonna let you fucking hang.

185
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:36,080
If you think I'm gonna fucking Tarzan to your rescue with cats and dogs.

186
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:37,080
Here it goes.

187
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:38,080
Here it goes.

188
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:39,080
Here it goes.

189
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:40,080
Here it goes.

190
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:41,080
Oh, here we go.

191
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:44,040
Janine Garofalo turned Uma Thurman into a human puppet.

192
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:45,040
I think.

193
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:49,920
Nailed it.

194
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:54,000
I'm a dude who loves to walk around the apartment in my underwear.

195
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:58,040
I step in the door and boom, my clothes are off.

196
00:06:58,040 --> 00:07:03,440
Now my roommates don't mind this, but one of them is Airbnb-ing his room while he summers

197
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:04,440
in Chicago.

198
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:05,440
Ruh-roh.

199
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:08,440
While he summers in Chicago.

200
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:11,520
While he summers in Chicago.

201
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:15,760
He has rented the room to a nice couple and has asked that in his three month absence,

202
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:18,840
I reframe some semi-nudity so he doesn't get a bad review.

203
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:21,840
I hate the idea of giving up on my freedom.

204
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:23,340
It's not my problem.

205
00:07:23,340 --> 00:07:25,460
Or is it?

206
00:07:25,460 --> 00:07:30,540
Am I the asshole here for wanting to continue a clothes-free lifestyle that's from nudists

207
00:07:30,540 --> 00:07:32,560
in New York?

208
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:33,560
You're in boxers.

209
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:34,560
Are you here?

210
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:35,560
Yeah!

211
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:43,000
Are Ozzy Osbourne, is that you?

212
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:48,800
I was fucking running a list of things I hope you don't sound like in my head.

213
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:51,800
Welcome to the apartment!

214
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:57,120
Check out my dick!

215
00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:03,720
Dear Airbnb review, this was a cool house, centrally located.

216
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:04,720
Great neighborhood.

217
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:07,480
Great neighborhood, very affordable.

218
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:11,600
The other thing about it is I can draw Chris' penis from memory.

219
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:17,040
Are you curious about every nook and cranny of Chris' penis?

220
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:18,040
Do you have an hour?

221
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:19,040
Okay.

222
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:20,040
Sit down.

223
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:22,440
He's got a lot of them.

224
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:25,440
Act one, the shaft.

225
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:30,520
Five star, ten out of ten.

226
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:31,520
Would recommend.

227
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:32,520
It was great.

228
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:33,520
No, it was great.

229
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:34,520
It was great.

230
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:35,520
The penis?

231
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:36,520
Great.

232
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:37,520
Good stuff.

233
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:38,520
Great.

234
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:42,320
How is this not a criminal crime for criminals?

235
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:46,840
I can't like bounce on my wife who I live with and be like, someone else is gonna be

236
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:47,840
here for a while.

237
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:49,840
I'm going to eat all the fruit by the foot later.

238
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:50,840
No, it's cool.

239
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:52,720
I'm going to get like 150 bucks.

240
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:53,720
It's totally cool.

241
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:57,280
Do you have to put that in like the Airbnb description?

242
00:08:57,280 --> 00:08:58,280
There might be a God in you.

243
00:08:58,280 --> 00:09:03,760
Do you think there's like coded language of like, open air plan, you know what I mean?

244
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:04,760
Derrick.

245
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:05,760
Open Derrick.

246
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:06,760
Open Derrick.

247
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:12,320
Public Derrick for use by all.

248
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:16,800
Why not?

249
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:17,800
I don't know.

250
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:20,280
Wait, I was about to make a joke about the guy's penis.

251
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:21,800
What is the name we settled on?

252
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:22,800
Chris Derrick?

253
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:23,800
Chris Derrick?

254
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:24,800
Chris Derrick?

255
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:25,800
Chris Derrick?

256
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:28,800
Hey, Chris Derrick, let me see you erotica.

257
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:31,160
Now I lost the joke, but I do remember his name is Chris Derrick.

258
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:34,560
And something about his penis.

259
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:36,960
That's just comedy math right there.

260
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:40,200
Name plus penis reference equals audience disappointment.

261
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:42,600
Six years of podcasting, apparently.

262
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:50,280
Hey, do you guys want a Yahoo answer from Yahoo Answers?

263
00:09:50,280 --> 00:10:00,840
Can you take a moment, though, and game recognize game Rachel Rosie for me real quick?

264
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:01,840
Thank you, Rachel.

265
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:02,840
It's about Yahoo Answers.

266
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:11,360
User Brian, who asks, can cops pull over other cops?

267
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:14,720
Let's say a cop was breaking the law, driving down the street for something like speeding

268
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:16,160
or not using a turn signal.

269
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:18,520
Can another cop get behind him and pull him over?

270
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:19,520
Got you.

271
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:20,520
Arrest you.

272
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:21,520
Good.

273
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:22,520
This time, Derrick again.

274
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:23,520
Derrick's been spelled differently.

275
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:28,520
You saw on Twitter over there on your phone?

276
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:29,520
What?

277
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:30,720
I thought we were supposed to tweet.

278
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:34,920
I wanted to tweet about the show happened, and I thought you guys could handle it.

279
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:35,920
Cool.

280
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:39,600
Already big time Mr. Hollywood phoning it in.

281
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:41,240
TVs were the real money.

282
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:45,560
You know, the first time we talked about this question, I thought of like plain clothes,

283
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:48,640
like a dude in a car who was like, I'm actually a cop.

284
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:53,280
But now I'm picturing like someone pulling over another cop car with a uniform on top.

285
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:54,280
But then what if-

286
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:55,280
Do you know why I pulled you over?

287
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:57,440
Yes, fuck, I know why you pulled me over.

288
00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:01,640
What if to catch that cop car, the second cop car had to speed, and we got a whole human

289
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:04,820
centipede situation?

290
00:11:04,820 --> 00:11:08,560
They sewed the cars together?

291
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:10,680
That seems cruel and unusual.

292
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:13,880
That is what happened in that movie.

293
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:14,880
Which one?

294
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:15,880
The human centipede.

295
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:16,880
Oh, I'm with you now.

296
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:20,440
Someone's got to stop him from doing like, I mean-

297
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:21,960
Who watches the Watchmen?

298
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:22,960
Yeah, exactly.

299
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:23,960
Exactly.

300
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:29,200
That's a good- Why has nobody ever thought of seeing if cops are on the love learn?

301
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:31,600
There should be a cop for cops.

302
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:32,600
Cop cop.

303
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:37,560
Do you think- Cop cop, time to go to jail or work.

304
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:39,720
Time to come to work with me.

305
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:41,000
Time to come to work with me.

306
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
You're in jail now.

307
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,560
Cop cop, making arrests, but no friends.

308
00:11:45,560 --> 00:11:47,280
You just said top cop, I think?

309
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:48,280
Top cop.

310
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:51,280
You got to make it to the top to arrest other cops.

311
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:52,680
Yeah, you got to be the king of cops.

312
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:54,720
You can't arrest from the bottom up.

313
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:57,280
You can't be first day on the job arresting the chief.

314
00:11:57,280 --> 00:11:58,440
First off, okay, two things.

315
00:11:58,440 --> 00:12:01,720
First off, coming this summer to TLC, top cop.

316
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:03,880
America's next top cop.

317
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:08,400
America's next top cop, and secondly, do you think they would have to get the best cop

318
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:10,040
to catch the other cops, right?

319
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:12,520
How do you want to think a cop with the best cop?

320
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:13,520
Not the worst cop.

321
00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:14,520
It was like, I don't know.

322
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:16,160
What do you even do?

323
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:26,680
Is President Barack Hussein Obama, and a lot of people forget about the Hussein, it's important.

324
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:30,720
I've never done that one live, and it was like, I didn't know how it was going to go.

325
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:31,720
It's okay.

326
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:32,720
You only said half the syllables.

327
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:36,120
Yeah, you kind of farted the last- Does President Barack Hussein, and a lot of

328
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:43,960
people forget about the Hussein, but it's important, Obama, is he the top cop?

329
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:46,960
Because the buck stops here, is that what that means?

330
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:50,640
The crime stops here, and I'm it, like if Joe Biden's speed, and he's like, I got you

331
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:52,000
and I'm the only one, dog.

332
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,000
Bad luck.

333
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,320
I was like right behind you in traffic.

334
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:56,520
I saw you turn left without the signal.

335
00:12:56,520 --> 00:12:58,040
Joe, that's a bad beat, dude.

336
00:12:58,040 --> 00:12:59,840
I'm literally the only dude.

337
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:00,840
It's me.

338
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:02,520
Why'd you do it in front of me?

339
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:03,520
I'm top cop.

340
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:04,520
You know this.

341
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:07,840
It's all checks and balances, because he can arrest Joe Biden, but who can arrest Barack

342
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:08,840
Obama?

343
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:13,400
The lowliest, the criminals.

344
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:17,960
Only criminals can arrest the president for speeding.

345
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:22,760
I love the world where the president's A, driving himself, and B, just like burning

346
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:23,760
it.

347
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:28,720
Just like pedal to the metal, see you bitches in Arlington, bye.

348
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:32,640
Him and Joe Biden have a famous series of pranks that they do back and forth on each

349
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:33,640
other.

350
00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:37,000
And this is the end game.

351
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:42,360
Do you think that cops, I was thinking about when we were saying come with me to jail,

352
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:43,360
I mean work.

353
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:50,480
Do you think cops, if the money's ever tight, just like decide to live in jail?

354
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:51,720
Cut down on the commute.

355
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:53,040
Just like there's no commute.

356
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:56,960
It's like, do you think it ever occurs to them like, well, I could just go home, or

357
00:13:56,960 --> 00:13:57,960
I could just live in jail.

358
00:13:57,960 --> 00:13:58,960
Do jail, I think.

359
00:13:58,960 --> 00:13:59,960
You got beds and everything?

360
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:02,960
You got beds.

361
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:08,280
Somebody can scoot my desk up close to the bar so I can do work and stuff.

362
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:09,640
I'll come back at the end of the day.

363
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:10,640
You let me out, I'll come back.

364
00:14:10,640 --> 00:14:11,640
I got nowhere else to go.

365
00:14:11,640 --> 00:14:12,640
Yeah.

366
00:14:12,640 --> 00:14:14,760
I mean, you should lock me in for security's sake, and it's really locking out.

367
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:15,760
I can't be trusted.

368
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:16,760
I can't be trusted.

369
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:17,760
Who knows?

370
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:18,760
I'm a wild man.

371
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:21,160
And then if you do get arrested for real, you're like used to it a little bit.

372
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:23,920
It's like, you know, I'm just back at work.

373
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:26,080
I'm just really, really busting my ass.

374
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:28,600
I'm really spending the nights at the old office.

375
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:30,600
How about another question?

376
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:31,600
Here's another question.

377
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:34,200
What?

378
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:37,200
Tell me how to live my life.

379
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:42,280
A few weeks ago, my girlfriend and I splurged on a fancy meal in an upscale restaurant.

380
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:43,280
One of the courses...

381
00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:44,280
Already loving it.

382
00:14:44,280 --> 00:14:45,280
Oh, shit.

383
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:46,280
Wait.

384
00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:47,280
Was it you?

385
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:48,280
Oh, yeah.

386
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:49,280
Wait, hold on.

387
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:54,020
The only information you got is someone wrote in about splurging on a fancy meal, and only

388
00:14:54,020 --> 00:14:58,240
one person in the audience went, I think that's me.

389
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:01,440
One of the courses was a Sunchoke dish garnished with dainty purple flowers.

390
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:02,440
What dish?

391
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:03,440
A Sunchoke dish?

392
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:04,440
It's a type of fish?

393
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:05,440
I believe it's a fish.

394
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:06,440
Fish?

395
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:09,320
Hey, is it a fish?

396
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:12,160
What was that noise?

397
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:13,160
Is it a fish?

398
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:14,560
It's like an artichoke?

399
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:18,960
I want one person to answer wherever I'm pointing into the void.

400
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:20,520
I was pointing there.

401
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:21,520
What is it?

402
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:22,520
Okay.

403
00:15:22,520 --> 00:15:23,520
Okay.

404
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:24,520
You don't have to fucking yell at me.

405
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:25,520
Yeah, we're on stage with you.

406
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:26,520
Okay.

407
00:15:26,520 --> 00:15:27,520
What's the demonstration?

408
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:28,520
I got internet.

409
00:15:28,520 --> 00:15:32,520
You know what we were doing while you were learning about types of fish?

410
00:15:32,520 --> 00:15:37,680
We're at podcast school, getting our degrees in podcasts.

411
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:41,680
Hey, this is like ginger.

412
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:42,880
Nice try, Sunchoke.

413
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:43,880
You're ginger.

414
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:44,880
Got them again.

415
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:48,920
It was a Sunchoke dish garnished with dainty purple flowers.

416
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:55,240
I ate some of the flowers, and I thought they were okay, but I didn't eat them all in case

417
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:56,960
they were just decoration.

418
00:15:56,960 --> 00:16:02,280
However, when the server cleared our table, he asked, sir, would you like to finish your

419
00:16:02,280 --> 00:16:06,760
flowers before I take your plate?

420
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:11,800
So then I felt obligated to eat the flowers as he watched.

421
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:14,200
I suddenly felt inexplicable shame as I chewed.

422
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:16,580
I can't imagine why.

423
00:16:16,580 --> 00:16:22,080
His gaze seemed to suggest, yes, little fancy boy loves eating little purple flowers, doesn't

424
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:23,080
he?

425
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:24,560
I'm no stranger to public shame.

426
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:30,560
I did magic in a talent show when I was six and later went on to play Oompa Loompa in

427
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:36,000
a community theater production of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory.

428
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,000
Tick tick boom.

429
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,920
My main question is this.

430
00:16:38,920 --> 00:16:42,160
Was this dude fucking with me?

431
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:47,160
Am I wrong to feel like he was shaming me for being a fancy flower boy?

432
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:50,040
As from Blossom Binging in Brooklyn.

433
00:16:50,040 --> 00:16:51,040
Yeah.

434
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:54,480
Hey, whoever you are.

435
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:57,680
I feel like I know you better than my brothers.

436
00:16:57,680 --> 00:17:02,240
Sometimes we finish a question and have to say like, we don't have enough information

437
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:03,400
to answer this.

438
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:04,400
That is not a problem.

439
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:07,080
We totally see what's going on here.

440
00:17:07,080 --> 00:17:09,720
I take some of that information, put it aside, save it for the winter.

441
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:15,000
You could have just written a question, I went to a place and a bully made me eat flowers.

442
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,480
A bully made me eat a whole bouquet.

443
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:20,040
What do I do now?

444
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:21,840
But you are here though, right?

445
00:17:21,840 --> 00:17:23,920
Oh, you're real close.

446
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:24,920
Okay.

447
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:26,200
The flower eater.

448
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:27,200
How do they taste?

449
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:28,200
How do they taste for real?

450
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:29,200
How do they taste?

451
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:30,200
Why are you yelling at him?

452
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:31,880
I'm really excited to find out.

453
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:32,880
Compare it.

454
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:33,880
What?

455
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:34,880
Savory.

456
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:40,280
Well, I can tell you where the floral element of it came from.

457
00:17:40,280 --> 00:17:43,000
No fucking root word.

458
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:49,000
No pun intended because apparently this is a root vegetable, the Sunchoke.

459
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:54,600
Is it possible that you weren't supposed to eat the flowers, but the guy had counted

460
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:57,720
how many flowers are on the plate when he put them down, and he came back with five

461
00:17:57,720 --> 00:18:01,400
and he was like, do you want to eat the rest?

462
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:03,360
You know what you're supposed to eat?

463
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:05,320
Anything you could swallow.

464
00:18:05,320 --> 00:18:09,840
No, you've had a baby for too long, that's not actually true.

465
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:16,120
Fucking markers, crayons, dice, it's all good in the hood.

466
00:18:16,120 --> 00:18:21,000
My brothers played, I was trying to get my baby to eat while still buffering was on,

467
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:25,000
my brothers played restaurant with her backstage.

468
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:28,160
What kind of wild and crazy rock star shenanigans do we get on?

469
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:29,160
Good question.

470
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:33,920
And then 45 minutes later, I said the sentence, oh yeah, they horny for this one.

471
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:35,160
So it all balances out.

472
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:36,480
We're very complex individuals.

473
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:38,720
That's how I come at you, hot and cold.

474
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:41,720
Let's say this, though, they got her to eat some chicken quesadilla, so what's up now?

475
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:43,680
Mission accomplished.

476
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:47,600
You ate the flowers, though, and that's great.

477
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:50,640
There's no part of that that doesn't make me very, very happy.

478
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:52,080
I like that.

479
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:56,440
This is to any other living person, I don't want to put you on blast, I'm saying it's

480
00:18:56,440 --> 00:19:01,080
a beautiful thing you've done here.

481
00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:07,040
Eating flowers is an in for a penny, in for a pound situation where you either don't eat

482
00:19:07,040 --> 00:19:13,600
the flowers because they're plants, or you eat all the flowers because it's like, hey

483
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:15,080
when in Rome, nom nom nom nom.

484
00:19:15,080 --> 00:19:18,520
You can't rule out plants from being eaten.

485
00:19:18,520 --> 00:19:24,720
Right, but like, the point he's making is, if they're decoration, you're not off the

486
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:26,600
hook by eating some.

487
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:27,600
Yeah.

488
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:30,840
Like, no, I just ate some of the decoration.

489
00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:33,080
Is this an ice cream bar or a candle?

490
00:19:33,080 --> 00:19:36,200
I'm going to take six to seven bites out of it.

491
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:37,880
No, you've committed.

492
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:40,280
You're eating the whole candle now.

493
00:19:40,280 --> 00:19:44,560
You need the waiter to come back and go, where is the candle, and you go, yum yum.

494
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:45,560
Yum yum in my belly.

495
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:48,640
Might I suggest the next time this happens, should this happen again or happen to anyone

496
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:53,560
out there, you eat two flowers, the person says, would you like to finish the flower,

497
00:19:53,560 --> 00:20:00,640
and you go, no, they're not the best I've had, and you big time them right back.

498
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:01,640
I've had better flowers.

499
00:20:01,640 --> 00:20:08,160
I will say this though, I've got a super pretty tummy, and you show them your tummy.

500
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:09,160
They'll love that.

501
00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:10,160
They love that.

502
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:12,680
That's what restaurants do.

503
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:16,880
You want to do another Yahoo?

504
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:17,880
Yeah.

505
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:18,880
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

506
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:19,880
Oops.

507
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:20,880
I lost the name on this one.

508
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:21,880
Dang it.

509
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:22,880
I'll find it.

510
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:23,880
Here we go.

511
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:24,880
It's also from Rachel Rosen.

512
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:25,880
Game Recognized Game.

513
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:26,880
Fuck.

514
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:28,240
It's a lot of game recognition going on.

515
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:37,520
It's from Yahoo Answers user, they're anonymous, and you're about to know why.

516
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:42,320
This anonymous user will call Derek, yeah.

517
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:44,320
Got it in one.

518
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:49,040
Derek asks, help me add to and improve a standup I'm writing.

519
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:54,120
Most of it's observational humor.

520
00:20:54,120 --> 00:20:55,120
Buckle up.

521
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:56,120
We got you.

522
00:20:56,120 --> 00:20:57,120
Ideas so far.

523
00:20:57,120 --> 00:21:00,120
Let's just run through some of these bullet points.

524
00:21:00,120 --> 00:21:02,480
Some standup comedy ideas.

525
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:04,400
Should I stand up and just deliver something?

526
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:05,400
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

527
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:07,760
If we didn't have any of you, we wouldn't stand up.

528
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:09,960
Let me get that spotlight.

529
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:10,960
Okay, okay, okay.

530
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:11,960
All right.

531
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:13,520
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

532
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:16,520
Our phones fall and we panic, right?

533
00:21:16,520 --> 00:21:17,580
Our friends fall.

534
00:21:17,580 --> 00:21:18,580
We laugh.

535
00:21:18,580 --> 00:21:19,580
Hey, guys.

536
00:21:19,580 --> 00:21:20,580
Phones, they're getting bigger.

537
00:21:20,580 --> 00:21:21,580
Our laptops are getting smaller.

538
00:21:21,580 --> 00:21:47,200
The best reaction you get from that is someone going, yes.

539
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:49,200
There's no laughter at that standup show.

540
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:51,200
Phones getting bigger, laptops getting smaller.

541
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:52,200
Yes.

542
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:53,200
Agreed.

543
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:54,200
They certainly are.

544
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:55,200
I noticed.

545
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:56,200
Uh-huh.

546
00:21:56,200 --> 00:21:57,200
Hey, guys.

547
00:21:57,200 --> 00:22:02,000
If there's no talking during the movie, isn't it then a silent movie?

548
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,680
No, it's fucking not.

549
00:22:04,680 --> 00:22:05,680
But hold on.

550
00:22:05,680 --> 00:22:07,240
They played into the bit.

551
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:10,000
Think about it, because it's not.

552
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,160
Oh, that's the joke.

553
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:13,760
Yes, yes, and no?

554
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:14,760
No.

555
00:22:14,760 --> 00:22:16,880
Vin Diesel's saying words up there in Fast 7.

556
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:21,020
You can hear them.

557
00:22:21,020 --> 00:22:22,920
When a guy likes a girl, he looks her in the eye.

558
00:22:22,920 --> 00:22:25,040
When a girl likes a guy, she looks away.

559
00:22:25,040 --> 00:22:28,700
Again, you're just, it's patently untrue.

560
00:22:28,700 --> 00:22:31,600
But also, what's the punchline there?

561
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:33,720
Just, the sky's blue.

562
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:34,720
Hey, guys.

563
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:37,920
Why does chicken, why does chicken mean wimp?

564
00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:40,920
A chicken will peck you to pieces.

565
00:22:40,920 --> 00:22:41,920
So a little bit of that.

566
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:42,920
That's how I lost my brother.

567
00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:45,920
That's a rural Seinfeld.

568
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:51,000
Okay, like, we're all having a lot of fun here, but let's all agree.

569
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:56,000
If we saw a human being, like us, you know how we're humans?

570
00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:02,580
If we saw a human being stand on stage and say these things as jokes, it would be literally

571
00:23:02,580 --> 00:23:05,440
the funniest comedian I've ever seen in my entire life.

572
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:08,400
But not, I would argue, for the right reasons.

573
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:09,400
Right reasons.

574
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:13,440
But if, hey, guys, right reasons.

575
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:20,240
The word none, though, this one's real, is just the letter N doing a cartwheel.

576
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:25,920
You have to think about that one for like 45 fucking seconds, but once you get there,

577
00:23:25,920 --> 00:23:26,920
it's good.

578
00:23:26,920 --> 00:23:33,260
Hey, no word, no word in the English language rhymes with month.

579
00:23:33,260 --> 00:23:34,260
That's another one.

580
00:23:34,260 --> 00:23:37,600
That wasn't just some weird non sequitur that I did.

581
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:41,540
Let's just punch these up real quick, guys.

582
00:23:41,540 --> 00:23:44,400
Do we have to do other jokes other than these jokes?

583
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:46,640
Our phones fall, we panic.

584
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:48,600
Our friends fall, we laugh.

585
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:53,280
What if your friend is like playing Angry Birds on your phone and like asteroid lands

586
00:23:53,280 --> 00:23:59,280
on both of them and you lose both and you're just, your reaction is just.

587
00:23:59,280 --> 00:24:00,280
I'm neutral.

588
00:24:00,280 --> 00:24:02,200
I'm completely neutral about this.

589
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:03,200
I don't know.

590
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:05,560
All those two events, they both canceled each other out.

591
00:24:05,560 --> 00:24:13,040
My friend is dead, but my tiny phone is also dead.

592
00:24:13,040 --> 00:24:18,880
It's very funny that my friend died, but very sad that my phone died.

593
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:27,600
Derek, oh my God, you're just standing there doing something.

594
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:28,840
Can I still get my numbers?

595
00:24:28,840 --> 00:24:31,440
Are those in the cloud?

596
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:35,280
I'll tell you who is in the cloud.

597
00:24:35,280 --> 00:24:37,280
James.

598
00:24:37,280 --> 00:24:43,400
Now see, that's a bit.

599
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:46,920
We did do the shit.

600
00:24:46,920 --> 00:24:47,920
That's a tight five.

601
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:48,920
Thank you.

602
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:49,920
That's my time.

603
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:50,920
Thank you.

604
00:24:50,920 --> 00:24:51,920
That's my time.

605
00:24:51,920 --> 00:24:52,920
You want to hear another question?

606
00:24:52,920 --> 00:24:53,920
Or do you want to punch up some more of those bad boys?

607
00:24:53,920 --> 00:24:57,120
No, I've literally, I can't anymore.

608
00:24:57,120 --> 00:25:01,720
At the grocery store line, the clerk got to my last item, a large bag of cherries.

609
00:25:01,720 --> 00:25:02,720
Okay.

610
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:03,720
I love this crowd.

611
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:09,160
This is the second time in a row, somebody's like, oh, here comes my shit.

612
00:25:09,160 --> 00:25:10,160
Everybody listen.

613
00:25:10,160 --> 00:25:11,160
Shut up.

614
00:25:11,160 --> 00:25:12,160
Shut up.

615
00:25:12,160 --> 00:25:13,160
Here comes the drop.

616
00:25:13,160 --> 00:25:14,160
Here comes my jam.

617
00:25:14,160 --> 00:25:15,160
Okay.

618
00:25:15,160 --> 00:25:19,480
At the grocery store checkout line, the clerk got to my last item, a large bag of cherries.

619
00:25:19,480 --> 00:25:34,520
They looked at the bag, then at me and said, you know, these are expensive, right?

620
00:25:34,520 --> 00:25:41,120
It's such a fucking, that's like a nuclear bird from like deployed from orbit.

621
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:43,640
So fucking good.

622
00:25:43,640 --> 00:25:49,360
Asking them to clarify might have sent the conversation to a super judgy place.

623
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:51,600
But in the future, too late, too late.

624
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:56,240
How should I handle egregious displays of fiscal judgment from cashiers or other service

625
00:25:56,240 --> 00:26:00,560
personnel that's from swimming in subtext?

626
00:26:00,560 --> 00:26:02,160
And that was you who laughed at it.

627
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:03,160
Yes.

628
00:26:03,160 --> 00:26:04,160
Oh, shit.

629
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:05,160
Okay.

630
00:26:05,160 --> 00:26:06,160
Somebody was just like, yeah, buy some cherries.

631
00:26:06,160 --> 00:26:07,160
Are you here?

632
00:26:07,160 --> 00:26:08,160
Are you here?

633
00:26:08,160 --> 00:26:09,160
Hi.

634
00:26:09,160 --> 00:26:10,160
Hi.

635
00:26:10,160 --> 00:26:11,160
Hi.

636
00:26:11,160 --> 00:26:12,160
You are here.

637
00:26:12,160 --> 00:26:13,160
How are the cherries?

638
00:26:13,160 --> 00:26:14,160
Moldy.

639
00:26:14,160 --> 00:26:15,160
Moldy?

640
00:26:15,160 --> 00:26:16,160
What the fuck?

641
00:26:16,160 --> 00:26:20,880
Are these your artisanal molded cherries?

642
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:22,720
Did you take them back after like that?

643
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:28,480
You were a real shithead to me and look at your garbage cherries.

644
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:33,560
At these prices, maybe they, did they kind of, were they patronizing when they said it?

645
00:26:33,560 --> 00:26:34,560
Like, did you?

646
00:26:34,560 --> 00:26:35,560
How could they not be?

647
00:26:35,560 --> 00:26:36,560
Yeah.

648
00:26:36,560 --> 00:26:37,560
Like.

649
00:26:37,560 --> 00:26:38,560
You know these are expensive, right?

650
00:26:38,560 --> 00:26:39,560
Good job.

651
00:26:39,560 --> 00:26:40,560
You did great.

652
00:26:40,560 --> 00:26:46,000
Did you, did you mean to get grapes?

653
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:47,600
Come on.

654
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:48,600
Come on, sweetheart.

655
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:53,480
Hey, why don't I put those, why don't I take those back for you and get you some grapes?

656
00:26:53,480 --> 00:26:55,200
You know grapes.

657
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:56,560
You ever have raisins?

658
00:26:56,560 --> 00:26:58,920
They're like dope raisins.

659
00:26:58,920 --> 00:26:59,920
Pre raisins.

660
00:26:59,920 --> 00:27:00,920
I call them.

661
00:27:00,920 --> 00:27:01,920
Come on.

662
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:02,920
Super wet raisins.

663
00:27:02,920 --> 00:27:03,920
They're good as heck.

664
00:27:03,920 --> 00:27:05,360
You're going to love eating these.

665
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:07,080
Grapes are like your cherries.

666
00:27:07,080 --> 00:27:08,080
You know what?

667
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:09,080
Hold on.

668
00:27:09,080 --> 00:27:10,640
Why don't you eat one cherry?

669
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:11,640
Just so I can watch.

670
00:27:11,640 --> 00:27:12,640
This is going to be adorable.

671
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:13,640
Oh, it's sour, isn't it?

672
00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:14,640
Wait, let me.

673
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:15,640
A little bit sweet.

674
00:27:15,640 --> 00:27:17,720
Oh, there's a hard thing in the middle.

675
00:27:17,720 --> 00:27:18,720
Let me find this.

676
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:19,720
Hold on.

677
00:27:19,720 --> 00:27:20,720
Oh, that's cute.

678
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:21,720
Look at him go.

679
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:23,440
Look at him eat that cherry for the first time.

680
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:24,440
What a sweet boy.

681
00:27:24,440 --> 00:27:29,320
That'll be a hundred dollars because that was a fucking cherry you just ate.

682
00:27:29,320 --> 00:27:35,840
They put those as the symbol on slot machines for a reason because you're rich.

683
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:39,440
The problem is if someone asked the question, you know, these are expensive, right?

684
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:43,360
There's literally no way to like come out from under that burn.

685
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:44,360
You can't say yes.

686
00:27:44,360 --> 00:27:46,880
Like, and sound like an adult.

687
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:47,880
Okay.

688
00:27:47,880 --> 00:27:49,360
Here's the old, like there's no cool way.

689
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:50,360
You're right, Travis.

690
00:27:50,360 --> 00:27:55,840
Because what, and one answer is, oh no, that sucks.

691
00:27:55,840 --> 00:28:01,000
The other answer is, hell yeah, let it ride.

692
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:02,120
This was just for me.

693
00:28:02,120 --> 00:28:03,120
I had a good month.

694
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:04,120
Hell yeah.

695
00:28:04,120 --> 00:28:05,120
I know they're expensive.

696
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:06,120
I love cherries.

697
00:28:06,120 --> 00:28:07,120
I earned this shit.

698
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:08,120
I promised myself.

699
00:28:08,120 --> 00:28:17,560
He said one day I would walk in here and I would buy the cherries.

700
00:28:17,560 --> 00:28:23,320
I saw the rich man when I was a kid and I said one day, that'll be me.

701
00:28:23,320 --> 00:28:24,680
I've earned this.

702
00:28:24,680 --> 00:28:29,120
Just say no and like ask if you could have someone help you back with them because you're

703
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:33,600
worried you'll drop them and you can't afford it.

704
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:35,240
You know there's this, I do.

705
00:28:35,240 --> 00:28:37,560
Could you pretend to put them in the bag, please?

706
00:28:37,560 --> 00:28:40,320
Just don't let people see you put them in the bag.

707
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:41,320
My boss is here.

708
00:28:41,320 --> 00:28:42,760
Yeah, do put grapes in there.

709
00:28:42,760 --> 00:28:44,200
Yes, of course, of course, of course.

710
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:45,200
Of course I fucked up.

711
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:46,200
Thank you for asking.

712
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:47,200
Thank you.

713
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:48,200
They look super duper similar.

714
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:49,200
Okay.

715
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:53,080
You're going to understand how I slipped up, but of course I want grapes instead.

716
00:28:53,080 --> 00:28:54,080
Can we get-

717
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:55,080
Yeah.

718
00:28:55,080 --> 00:28:56,080
Can we do our special-

719
00:28:56,080 --> 00:28:57,080
No, no.

720
00:28:57,080 --> 00:28:58,080
I want the one.

721
00:28:58,080 --> 00:28:59,080
I want the one.

722
00:28:59,080 --> 00:29:04,600
You've been teasing with it for two shows about the TV question.

723
00:29:04,600 --> 00:29:05,600
Okay.

724
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:06,600
All right.

725
00:29:06,600 --> 00:29:07,600
We've got a wonderful-

726
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:08,600
Type two.

727
00:29:08,600 --> 00:29:11,080
We're going to do a type two about this Yahoo that's sent in by Aaron Keyes.

728
00:29:11,080 --> 00:29:12,080
Thank you, Aaron Keyes.

729
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:13,080
I'm sorry-

730
00:29:13,080 --> 00:29:16,720
Remember, you credit me for whatever happens in the next two minutes unless it's bad.

731
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:17,720
Okay.

732
00:29:17,720 --> 00:29:18,720
Thank you, Aaron Keyes.

733
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:19,720
It's from Yahoo.

734
00:29:19,720 --> 00:29:34,640
Answers user lalizard who asks, in home improvement, are the sons related to Tim Allen?

735
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:43,160
They look so much like him.

736
00:29:43,160 --> 00:29:49,200
In the series Home Improvement, Tim Allen has three sons, Brad, Randy, and Mark.

737
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:51,560
Two of the kids look exactly like Tim Allen.

738
00:29:51,560 --> 00:29:55,480
I'm frustrated.

739
00:29:55,480 --> 00:29:56,480
Which two?

740
00:29:56,480 --> 00:29:57,840
I have to know.

741
00:29:57,840 --> 00:29:59,520
Are they related in any way?

742
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:03,400
Maybe not as actual sons in real life, but maybe his nephews or something.

743
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:06,120
You're already backpedaling.

744
00:30:06,120 --> 00:30:07,400
They just have to be related.

745
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:08,400
Can someone please help?

746
00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:09,400
It's killing me.

747
00:30:09,400 --> 00:30:10,400
It's killing me.

748
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:16,560
I think about those sons from Home Improvement so much.

749
00:30:16,560 --> 00:30:23,080
If they're not related, I don't even know what to think.

750
00:30:23,080 --> 00:30:26,240
Which two look like Tim Allen?

751
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:28,440
It doesn't matter.

752
00:30:28,440 --> 00:30:30,040
Are they related?

753
00:30:30,040 --> 00:30:35,640
That would be weird, though, if they got two of his sons in their neighborhood friends.

754
00:30:35,640 --> 00:30:36,640
Stupid Reggie.

755
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:37,640
We wanted three.

756
00:30:37,640 --> 00:30:38,640
Do you got anybody else?

757
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:39,640
We got stupid Reggie.

758
00:30:39,640 --> 00:30:40,640
Stupid Reggie are friends of mine.

759
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:41,640
We only expected this to go a season.

760
00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:42,640
Yeah, he's a doofus.

761
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:43,640
You want him for the acting?

762
00:30:43,640 --> 00:30:44,640
We can get him.

763
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:45,640
He's cheap.

764
00:30:45,640 --> 00:30:55,560
I always did assume they were the love child of Tim Allen and Richard Karn.

765
00:30:55,560 --> 00:30:56,560
They-

766
00:30:56,560 --> 00:30:57,560
Those are Richard Karn's boys.

767
00:30:57,560 --> 00:30:58,560
Yeah.

768
00:30:58,560 --> 00:30:59,560
Oh, the Karn boys?

769
00:30:59,560 --> 00:31:00,560
Oh, the Karn boys.

770
00:31:00,560 --> 00:31:01,560
Yeah, I love those guys.

771
00:31:01,560 --> 00:31:03,280
Karn boys are at it again.

772
00:31:03,280 --> 00:31:07,280
They experience Karnal pleasures and they-

773
00:31:07,280 --> 00:31:10,200
Shut the fuck up.

774
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:11,200
I'm just saying-

775
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:12,200
Go to prison.

776
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:13,200
Oh my God.

777
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:19,000
If he ever had a late nights and weekend R&B show, that would be like the greatest time.

778
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:20,000
Like he's a DJ.

779
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:21,000
Karnal pleasures.

780
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:22,000
You're listening.

781
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,720
We talked about this on the show, but he does host a celebrity golf tournament called The

782
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:25,720
Carnival.

783
00:31:25,720 --> 00:31:26,720
That's legit and real.

784
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:28,560
And you can buy tickets to just like go to it.

785
00:31:28,560 --> 00:31:30,360
And I guess just hang out with Rich.

786
00:31:30,360 --> 00:31:31,360
Rich.

787
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:32,360
With Sweet Rich.

788
00:31:32,360 --> 00:31:36,160
But no, they definitely junior'd each other, Tim Allen and Richard Karn.

789
00:31:36,160 --> 00:31:42,320
Did you see that movie Junior where Tim Allen had sex with Richard Karn?

790
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:43,320
I haven't seen-

791
00:31:43,320 --> 00:31:45,200
It must not get blue.

792
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:46,200
It was romantic.

793
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:47,200
Tender.

794
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:48,200
Yeah.

795
00:31:48,200 --> 00:31:49,200
Tender.

796
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:50,200
They meant it.

797
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:51,200
I heard full penetration.

798
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:57,240
I didn't see the movie Junior, but the best scene in it was when Arnold Schwarzenegger

799
00:31:57,240 --> 00:32:02,080
and Dane DeVito, I assume, may love for 30 minutes tenderly-

800
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:03,080
30 minutes.

801
00:32:03,080 --> 00:32:04,080
It was a third of the movie.

802
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:05,080
Yeah.

803
00:32:05,080 --> 00:32:09,800
They went from, cover your ears if you don't want to hear this, from fully soft.

804
00:32:09,800 --> 00:32:12,500
Like you saw every act, every part of it.

805
00:32:12,500 --> 00:32:15,000
Like them coming in the front door and putting their keys down.

806
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:16,000
Like how was your day?

807
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:17,000
Like I'm feeling it.

808
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:18,000
You feeling it?

809
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:19,000
Yeah.

810
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:20,000
Fully soft.

811
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:21,000
Well, not right now, but like maybe in two minutes.

812
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:22,000
Okay, great.

813
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,360
Let's eat some pasta.

814
00:32:24,360 --> 00:32:27,360
We got to carve up.

815
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:32,480
This is going to go long.

816
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:33,480
That was all you.

817
00:32:33,480 --> 00:32:44,800
Just want to go ahead and put that disclaimer back on there.

818
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:51,920
Folks, we hate to break into the action here, but we want to take a second-

819
00:32:51,920 --> 00:32:54,240
This nonstop thrill a minute.

820
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:55,240
Chill a minute.

821
00:32:55,240 --> 00:32:56,240
Action.

822
00:32:56,240 --> 00:32:57,240
Disaster.

823
00:32:57,240 --> 00:32:58,240
Chill a minute.

824
00:32:58,240 --> 00:32:59,840
Hey, why don't you chill for a bit?

825
00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:01,400

Now how good is Squarespace websites, you ask?

845
00:33:52,600 --> 00:33:59,240
I'm glad that you did ask because I made a website inside of which I trapped my brother

846
00:33:59,240 --> 00:34:00,240
Travis McElroy.

847
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:02,440
Yeah, kind of a Phantom Zone type thing.

848
00:34:02,440 --> 00:34:06,360
It's like a Phantom Zone place where I've trapped Travis and now he spends his days

849
00:34:06,360 --> 00:34:12,880
surfing the web helping teens solve mysteries and cyberbullying a lot.

850
00:34:12,880 --> 00:34:16,600
Is he doing the cyberbullying or is he stopping it or what's up helping the teens?

851
00:34:16,600 --> 00:34:20,160
He's doing it a lot and he's very good at it because he is cyber.

852
00:34:20,160 --> 00:34:21,160
He is cyber.

853
00:34:21,160 --> 00:34:22,160
Hey, goofball.

854
00:34:22,160 --> 00:34:25,120
By the way, Travis is in the cyber dimension.

855
00:34:25,120 --> 00:34:26,120
That's right.

856
00:34:26,120 --> 00:34:27,120
He's not here.

857
00:34:27,120 --> 00:34:29,360
He's also at MaxFunCon, which I didn't fucking know he's going to.

858
00:34:29,360 --> 00:34:30,360
That's cool.

859
00:34:30,360 --> 00:34:31,360
That's cool.

860
00:34:31,360 --> 00:34:32,360
Have fun.

861
00:34:32,360 --> 00:34:33,360
I guess we don't tell each other things.

862
00:34:33,360 --> 00:34:34,360
We're not really a unit, huh?

863
00:34:34,360 --> 00:34:35,360
Kind of fun.

864
00:34:35,360 --> 00:34:36,360
We're a package deal.

865
00:34:36,360 --> 00:34:37,360
Interesting.

866
00:34:37,360 --> 00:34:38,360
Kind of broke away from the shark pack, huh?

867
00:34:38,360 --> 00:34:39,360
Tell me about Bowlin Branch.

868
00:34:39,360 --> 00:34:40,360

Yeah, I love it.

879
00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:06,760
We say this all the time on Sawbones.

880
00:35:06,760 --> 00:35:08,520
We do not sleep on other sheets.

881
00:35:08,520 --> 00:35:11,680
When those sheets are dirty, we wash those sheets and then put them back on the bed.

882
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:12,680
We have other sheets.

883
00:35:12,680 --> 00:35:13,680
We don't sleep on them.

884
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:14,680

00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:45,320
Go to bowl, branch.com.

899
00:35:45,320 --> 00:35:46,440
Use the promo code MYBROTHER.

900
00:35:46,440 --> 00:35:47,440
That's all one word.

901
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:48,440
My brother.

902
00:35:48,440 --> 00:35:49,440
My brother.

903
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:50,440
My brother.

904
00:35:50,440 --> 00:35:51,440
Oh, so luxurious.

905
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:52,440
How about a Jumbotron?

906
00:35:52,440 --> 00:35:54,280
If you want to get a message on this show, a personal message to a friend or maybe for

907
00:35:54,280 --> 00:35:57,200
a small business, just go to maximumfun.org.jumbotron.

908
00:35:57,200 --> 00:35:59,160
They'll help you do that exactly.

909
00:35:59,160 --> 00:36:04,680
This message is for Poopsie and it's from Moopsie.

910
00:36:04,680 --> 00:36:05,680
Got it.

911
00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:08,360
Who says, happy birthday six months ago.

912
00:36:08,360 --> 00:36:10,520
Well, was that worth the wait?

913
00:36:10,520 --> 00:36:13,680
Since this is halfway late, it counts as halfway early, so you're welcome.

914
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:17,680
Love you muchly and even though I know part of your heart belongs to three other dudes,

915
00:36:17,680 --> 00:36:20,800
they are brothers and married and that's gross.

916
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:22,120
Get it together, Grady.

917
00:36:22,120 --> 00:36:26,200
You're still always numbers one through five with me.

918
00:36:26,200 --> 00:36:27,200
Smoot.

919
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:32,920
Wait, that might be the beginning of the word smooth, but I do very much like, here's the

920
00:36:32,920 --> 00:36:33,920
thing.

921
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:34,920
Slang term for smooching.

922
00:36:34,920 --> 00:36:41,560
Right, or salutations or my condolences or best regards.

923
00:36:41,560 --> 00:36:42,880
That shit, it's done.

924
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:43,880
Now?

925
00:36:43,880 --> 00:36:44,880
Over with.

926
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:45,880
When you're done, when you send an email?

927
00:36:45,880 --> 00:36:46,880
Smoot.

928
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:47,880
Smoot.

929
00:36:47,880 --> 00:36:48,880
I love that.

930
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:52,120
So we got another personal message here.

931
00:36:52,120 --> 00:37:00,060
Another sort of, I think you could call it an e-smoot from Claire Winnick and sorry,

932
00:37:00,060 --> 00:37:05,920
it is for Claire Winnick and it is from the sweet baby Nichols brother, Jake.

933
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:07,820
And that's her name is pronounced Nichols.

934
00:37:07,820 --> 00:37:08,820
So I got it right.

935
00:37:08,820 --> 00:37:10,160
Yeah, you did very good.

936
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:11,240
No problem there.

937
00:37:11,240 --> 00:37:12,240
Happy 30th birthday.

938
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:18,200
It says, there seemed to be no greater gift than immortalizing you in the intricate mythology

939
00:37:18,200 --> 00:37:23,400
of the bim bamma verse nestled on the shelves of an Indiana Jones-esque warehouse somewhere

940
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:25,560
between the lost gushy tapes.

941
00:37:25,560 --> 00:37:26,560
They're never getting out.

942
00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:27,560
Stop asking.

943
00:37:27,560 --> 00:37:30,160
And I literally, I don't have, they were deleted.

944
00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:31,600
Do you not, do you guys understand?

945
00:37:31,600 --> 00:37:35,960
When I delete, when I edit something out of a podcast, I don't take that audio and then

946
00:37:35,960 --> 00:37:39,300
put it in a little folder and say like for savesies.

947
00:37:39,300 --> 00:37:40,300
It goes to hell.

948
00:37:40,300 --> 00:37:42,560
It goes to deleted hell.

949
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:46,820
Between the gushy tapes and Willem Dafoe in a handmade green goblin costume, your name

950
00:37:46,820 --> 00:37:53,200
will live eternally in semi-obscurity what you've always wanted and that is for Claire.

951
00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:55,720
Happy 30th birthday, Claire, and that's from Jake.

952
00:37:55,720 --> 00:37:57,480
So thanks, baby Jake.

953
00:37:57,480 --> 00:37:58,480
Thank you, Jake.

954
00:37:58,480 --> 00:37:59,480
Jake from State Farm.

955
00:37:59,480 --> 00:38:00,480
Magic baby Jake.

956
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:04,720
I like anytime anybody says Jake, I like to say like Jake from State Farm, like the commercial.

957
00:38:04,720 --> 00:38:09,320
Well, it's worth asking because one out of a million, the person's gonna say yeah, in

958
00:38:09,320 --> 00:38:10,320
fact.

959
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:11,320
Yeah, that is actually me, Jake from State Farm.

960
00:38:11,320 --> 00:38:12,320
That's me.

961
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:13,320
I'm Jake from State Farm.

962
00:38:13,320 --> 00:38:15,000
Anyway, that's gonna do it for us.

963
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:20,460
For the ad portion of our program, we got a lot more jokes for you, lots of jokes.

964
00:38:20,460 --> 00:38:23,120
Thank you everybody who came out to all the live shows in DC and New York.

965
00:38:23,120 --> 00:38:24,120
Thanks to John Hodgman.

966
00:38:24,120 --> 00:38:27,600
Is he out there yet or did I just ruin the surprise?

967
00:38:27,600 --> 00:38:28,600
I don't know.

968
00:38:28,600 --> 00:38:29,600
We gotta think of him at some point.

969
00:38:29,600 --> 00:38:30,600
I'm gonna thank him right now.

970
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:34,920
Thanks John Hodgman for your help with the show.

971
00:38:34,920 --> 00:38:35,920
And we had a great time.

972
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:37,280
Hope everybody who came out did too.

973
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:38,680
Boston, we're coming for you, dawg.

974
00:38:38,680 --> 00:38:39,920
Those shows sold out.

975
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:40,920
Thanks Boston.

976
00:38:40,920 --> 00:38:41,920
Thanks Beantown.

977
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:42,920
Watch your butt.

978
00:38:42,920 --> 00:38:43,920
Watch your butt, Beantown.

979
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:44,920
Smoot.

980
00:38:44,920 --> 00:38:45,920
Smoot.

981
00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:46,920
Hey guys, this is Adam Conover.

982
00:38:46,920 --> 00:38:49,160
You may know me from my true TV show, Adam Ruins Everything.

983
00:38:49,160 --> 00:38:50,160
Well guess what?

984
00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:53,200
Now we're doing a podcast version right here on Maximum Fun.

985
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:56,360
What we do is we take all the interesting, fascinating experts that we talked to for

986
00:38:56,360 --> 00:39:00,760
just a couple minutes on the show and we sit with them for an entire podcast, really going

987
00:39:00,760 --> 00:39:04,240
deep and getting into the fascinating details of their work.

988
00:39:04,240 --> 00:39:09,000
And Adam Ruins Everything wherever you get your podcasts or at MaximumFun.org.

989
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:10,400
So we do our, we have a thing.

990
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:12,080
Okay, so like a couple weeks ago.

991
00:39:12,080 --> 00:39:15,000
I have the thing here, the OG.

992
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:17,840
Don't read the OG, but do read the OG story.

993
00:39:17,840 --> 00:39:18,840
Okay.

994
00:39:18,840 --> 00:39:19,840
Okay.

995
00:39:19,840 --> 00:39:23,780
My Brother, My Brother and Me episode 304, a very recent one.

996
00:39:23,780 --> 00:39:28,720
We had, we do a segment in the middle of the show called The Money Zone, which is where

997
00:39:28,720 --> 00:39:29,720
we get paid.

998
00:39:29,720 --> 00:39:38,040
And in episode 304, we had a very special part of The Money Zone where somebody sent

999
00:39:38,040 --> 00:39:44,600
in a message that was unfortunately the funniest thing that's maybe ever happened on the show.

1000
00:39:44,600 --> 00:39:46,960
They are, what are their names, Griffin?

1001
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:51,960
Their names are Avital and Rishi.

1002
00:39:51,960 --> 00:39:53,880
And who put who on blast?

1003
00:39:53,880 --> 00:39:59,680
Rishi put Avital so fucking on blast that they were like pushed 10 feet into the ground.

1004
00:39:59,680 --> 00:40:03,480
And it was so good.

1005
00:40:03,480 --> 00:40:06,840
And the first off, let me say they're here.

1006
00:40:06,840 --> 00:40:07,840
Oh yeah.

1007
00:40:07,840 --> 00:40:08,840
Yeah.

1008
00:40:08,840 --> 00:40:09,840
Avital and Rishi, you guys here?

1009
00:40:09,840 --> 00:40:10,840
Just stand up real quick.

1010
00:40:10,840 --> 00:40:11,840
Perfect.

1011
00:40:11,840 --> 00:40:12,840
Thank you.

1012
00:40:12,840 --> 00:40:13,840
Oh, front row, center.

1013
00:40:13,840 --> 00:40:14,840
Thank you.

1014
00:40:14,840 --> 00:40:15,840
Hello.

1015
00:40:15,840 --> 00:40:16,840
The best.

1016
00:40:16,840 --> 00:40:17,840
The best.

1017
00:40:17,840 --> 00:40:19,760
Thank you for, this is the fucking funniest thing that's ever happened.

1018
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:24,800
Now it's a message about, it's a message of, I mean, it's about Coldplay, but it's really

1019
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:25,800
about Rebirth.

1020
00:40:25,800 --> 00:40:27,840
Rebirth, I guess.

1021
00:40:27,840 --> 00:40:32,680
And it was a, we should set it up a little bit more, a live journal message that Avital

1022
00:40:32,680 --> 00:40:39,160
wrote a while ago about Coldplay and how transformative seeing Coldplay was.

1023
00:40:39,160 --> 00:40:44,400
We read some of the message, but there wasn't enough room in the Jumbotron to read the whole

1024
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:45,400
message.

1025
00:40:45,400 --> 00:40:48,320
So we have it in its entirety.

1026
00:40:48,320 --> 00:40:52,360
And we debated back and forth about which one of us would read it.

1027
00:40:52,360 --> 00:40:54,420
And the answer was none of us.

1028
00:40:54,420 --> 00:40:59,600
So without further ado, we'd like to welcome to the stage, John Hodgman.

1029
00:40:59,600 --> 00:41:00,600
Coldplay.

1030
00:41:00,600 --> 00:41:05,400
Keep it, keep it up guys.

1031
00:41:05,400 --> 00:41:14,840
He really needs a, okay, wait, wait, hold on, time out, time out.

1032
00:41:14,840 --> 00:41:17,800
Coldplay comes on.

1033
00:41:17,800 --> 00:41:20,460
My God.

1034
00:41:20,460 --> 00:41:35,560
When they had started up in my place and I saw him on stage and he was singing to heaven.

1035
00:41:35,560 --> 00:41:41,840
I swear his arms were outstretched.

1036
00:41:41,840 --> 00:42:06,240
He was just so at peace with himself and everything, just so free.

1037
00:42:06,240 --> 00:42:13,640
Are we not done?

1038
00:42:13,640 --> 00:42:16,920
I started crying.

1039
00:42:16,920 --> 00:42:21,080
Not just crying, sobbing.

1040
00:42:21,080 --> 00:42:30,840
I dredged everything up and everything melted away.

1041
00:42:30,840 --> 00:42:36,600
But it was me and the words.

1042
00:42:36,600 --> 00:42:57,560
I cried for everything bad that had happened to anyone.

1043
00:42:57,560 --> 00:43:05,600
That people live in fear, that there is injustice and cruelty.

1044
00:43:05,600 --> 00:43:12,520
And that I take what I have for granted.

1045
00:43:12,520 --> 00:43:21,640
I cried on behalf of everything.

1046
00:43:21,640 --> 00:43:29,520
Oh God.

1047
00:43:29,520 --> 00:43:35,520
And he sang.

1048
00:43:35,520 --> 00:43:48,160
No one ever said it would be easy.

1049
00:43:48,160 --> 00:44:00,080
And I, I knew what he meant.

1050
00:44:00,080 --> 00:44:05,960
It was so meaningful.

1051
00:44:05,960 --> 00:44:09,380
It sounds dumb.

1052
00:44:09,380 --> 00:44:12,820
It sounds dumb.

1053
00:44:12,820 --> 00:44:37,160
When I was momentarily at peace myself, Coldplay is so awesome.

1054
00:44:37,160 --> 00:44:57,120
All I needed was yellow.

1055
00:44:57,120 --> 00:45:06,000
All I needed was yellow.

1056
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:08,000
And I'm okay again.

1057
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:09,000
Yes!

1058
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:16,000
Ladies and gentlemen, John Audrey.

1059
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:18,000
Brilliant.

1060
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:28,840
John, would you like to stay on stage and help us answer some audience questions?

1061
00:45:28,840 --> 00:45:29,840
Yes, please.

1062
00:45:29,840 --> 00:45:30,840
Yes.

1063
00:45:30,840 --> 00:45:31,840
Is there a chair?

1064
00:45:31,840 --> 00:45:32,840
May we have a chair?

1065
00:45:32,840 --> 00:45:33,840
Thank you.

1066
00:45:33,840 --> 00:45:34,840
Thank you.

1067
00:45:34,840 --> 00:45:35,840
Thank you very much.

1068
00:45:35,840 --> 00:45:38,200
John, he's going to read some dope shit I read about train.

1069
00:45:38,200 --> 00:45:39,200
This guy.

1070
00:45:39,200 --> 00:45:41,200
No, I didn't write anything about train.

1071
00:45:41,200 --> 00:45:43,240
Seriously, thank you for letting us read that.

1072
00:45:43,240 --> 00:45:44,240
Thank you.

1073
00:45:44,240 --> 00:45:45,240
Stand up again.

1074
00:45:45,240 --> 00:45:46,240
Another big round of applause.

1075
00:45:46,240 --> 00:45:47,240
No.

1076
00:45:47,240 --> 00:45:48,240
It's so wonderful.

1077
00:45:48,240 --> 00:45:49,240
That was so, so, so good.

1078
00:45:49,240 --> 00:45:50,240
It was beautifully written.

1079
00:45:50,240 --> 00:45:51,240
It makes me so sad.

1080
00:45:51,240 --> 00:45:52,240
The funniest thing that's ever happened on our show has nothing to do with us.

1081
00:45:52,240 --> 00:45:53,240
Let's say I love you.

1082
00:45:53,240 --> 00:45:54,240
This is life.

1083
00:45:54,240 --> 00:45:55,240
Hey, thanks for doing that, John.

1084
00:45:55,240 --> 00:45:56,240
Oh, it was my pleasure.

1085
00:45:56,240 --> 00:45:57,240
We're going to take some audience questions.

1086
00:45:57,240 --> 00:46:10,960
And the way this works is this, you raise your hand, you get called on, you come to

1087
00:46:10,960 --> 00:46:17,240
the microphone, you ask us, all four of us, my brother, my brother, my brother, and me,

1088
00:46:17,240 --> 00:46:20,960
all four, for advice, and we help you.

1089
00:46:20,960 --> 00:46:21,960
There is one rule.

1090
00:46:21,960 --> 00:46:24,520
What's the one rule, everybody?

1091
00:46:24,520 --> 00:46:25,520
No bummers.

1092
00:46:25,520 --> 00:46:26,520
That is correct.

1093
00:46:26,520 --> 00:46:28,760
So, who has a question that is not a bummer?

1094
00:46:28,760 --> 00:46:29,760
Oh, my God.

1095
00:46:29,760 --> 00:46:30,760
The pressure is so on.

1096
00:46:30,760 --> 00:46:32,200
I saw the gentleman there in the light blue shirt.

1097
00:46:32,200 --> 00:46:33,200
Come on up.

1098
00:46:33,200 --> 00:46:34,200
Yeah.

1099
00:46:34,200 --> 00:46:35,200
The mic is actually behind you.

1100
00:46:35,200 --> 00:46:36,200
Yeah.

1101
00:46:36,200 --> 00:46:37,200
Yeah.

1102
00:46:37,200 --> 00:46:38,200
The gentleman there in the light blue shirt.

1103
00:46:38,200 --> 00:46:39,200
While he's walking to the mic, may I just say one thing?

1104
00:46:39,200 --> 00:46:40,200
Yes.

1105
00:46:40,200 --> 00:46:41,200
Sure.

1106
00:46:41,200 --> 00:46:45,640
I was very moved by your description of Arnold Schwarzenegger and Danny DeVito having sex.

1107
00:46:45,640 --> 00:46:48,400
The weird thing is that it wasn't, like, romantic.

1108
00:46:48,400 --> 00:46:49,600
No.

1109
00:46:49,600 --> 00:46:50,600
They were just like...

1110
00:46:50,600 --> 00:46:53,040
It was purely of convenience.

1111
00:46:53,040 --> 00:46:55,440
They were porking for science.

1112
00:46:55,440 --> 00:46:57,120
They were porking for science.

1113
00:46:57,120 --> 00:47:02,280
It reminded me that when I was a young person here in New York City, my friends and I had

1114
00:47:02,280 --> 00:47:06,400
a would-you-rather game with one specific question.

1115
00:47:06,400 --> 00:47:14,720
Would you rather cuddle with Danny DeVito nude every night for the rest of your life...

1116
00:47:14,720 --> 00:47:15,720
That one.

1117
00:47:15,720 --> 00:47:24,520
...or have Danny DeVito call you every day and have to talk with him for an hour?

1118
00:47:24,520 --> 00:47:26,840
They're both really good things.

1119
00:47:26,840 --> 00:47:27,840
Yeah.

1120
00:47:27,840 --> 00:47:29,320
I mean, they're both good outcomes.

1121
00:47:29,320 --> 00:47:31,360
You're the centerpiece of my day.

1122
00:47:31,360 --> 00:47:32,360
Don't make me choose.

1123
00:47:32,360 --> 00:47:33,360
I know.

1124
00:47:33,360 --> 00:47:37,000
And we talked about it for a long time because we couldn't decide.

1125
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:44,400
And I understand you want to ask your question, sir, but I don't care about you.

1126
00:47:44,400 --> 00:47:54,000
In the year 2012, I took my family on a vacation to London, England, and we stayed in a hotel.

1127
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:56,640
And I took my children, who were very young at the time.

1128
00:47:56,640 --> 00:48:03,760
They're approximately four years older each now, but at the time they were younger, by

1129
00:48:03,760 --> 00:48:04,760
roughly eight years.

1130
00:48:04,760 --> 00:48:06,760
It was a weird thing.

1131
00:48:06,760 --> 00:48:12,700
Anyway, we went up to the pool of this hotel in London, England, and because it was London,

1132
00:48:12,700 --> 00:48:15,720
the pool was about the size of a postage stamp.

1133
00:48:15,720 --> 00:48:25,120
And we were there, and there was a weird old man there doing exercises.

1134
00:48:25,120 --> 00:48:26,120
What do you call these?

1135
00:48:26,120 --> 00:48:27,120
Bicep curls?

1136
00:48:27,120 --> 00:48:28,120
Bicep curls.

1137
00:48:28,120 --> 00:48:29,120
Yes, exactly so.

1138
00:48:29,120 --> 00:48:30,120
And it took me a while to realize.

1139
00:48:30,120 --> 00:48:31,960
Why was I the one to get that?

1140
00:48:31,960 --> 00:48:32,960
You beat me through.

1141
00:48:32,960 --> 00:48:33,960
You jumped.

1142
00:48:33,960 --> 00:48:38,000
It took me a while to realize that that man was Danny DeVito.

1143
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:39,000
Nice.

1144
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:40,120
Getting some gains.

1145
00:48:40,120 --> 00:48:41,560
And I was like, how about that?

1146
00:48:41,560 --> 00:48:42,560
There's Danny DeVito.

1147
00:48:42,560 --> 00:48:45,520
Well, children, it's time to leave immediately.

1148
00:48:45,520 --> 00:48:53,200
And before we could go, Danny DeVito caught my eye, and he said, daily show.

1149
00:48:53,200 --> 00:48:57,280
I'm like, oh, Jesus, kids.

1150
00:48:57,280 --> 00:49:03,120
You were physically putting yourself between them and Danny DeVito.

1151
00:49:03,120 --> 00:49:08,280
And I went over, and I'm like, hello, Danny DeVito, who, by the way, is a hero of mine.

1152
00:49:08,280 --> 00:49:12,300
But Danny DeVito, all I wanted to do is take my kids back to the room so we could get on

1153
00:49:12,300 --> 00:49:13,300
with the day.

1154
00:49:13,300 --> 00:49:16,960
And Danny DeVito just started talking and talking and talking about his love for the

1155
00:49:16,960 --> 00:49:18,160
daily show.

1156
00:49:18,160 --> 00:49:20,520
And then he took his shirt off.

1157
00:49:20,520 --> 00:49:21,520
Nice.

1158
00:49:21,520 --> 00:49:22,520
To go swimming.

1159
00:49:22,520 --> 00:49:24,120
To show you his John Stewart tattoo.

1160
00:49:24,120 --> 00:49:25,120
No, no, no.

1161
00:49:25,120 --> 00:49:31,160
He was just going to go swimming, and it was this profound, weird moment where I realized

1162
00:49:31,160 --> 00:49:40,280
both versions of my dream are coming true.

1163
00:49:40,280 --> 00:49:41,280
And with that, your question.

1164
00:49:41,280 --> 00:49:42,280
Your question.

1165
00:49:42,280 --> 00:49:43,280
I hadn't thought about that.

1166
00:49:43,280 --> 00:49:44,280
It was a wonderful life you've led.

1167
00:49:44,280 --> 00:49:45,280
Also, I love you, Danny DeVito.

1168
00:49:45,280 --> 00:49:46,280
All right, go on.

1169
00:49:46,280 --> 00:49:48,840
If you're listening, please, you're welcome any time.

1170
00:49:48,840 --> 00:49:52,000
I'll cuddle with you or talk to you every day for the rest of my life.

1171
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:55,040
What if this guy, like, what's your name, and this guy's like, my name's Steve DeVito,

1172
00:49:55,040 --> 00:49:56,040
and I'm not entertained.

1173
00:49:56,040 --> 00:49:58,680
Could be.

1174
00:49:58,680 --> 00:49:59,680
What is your real name?

1175
00:49:59,680 --> 00:50:00,680
My name's Tim.

1176
00:50:00,680 --> 00:50:01,680
What?

1177
00:50:01,680 --> 00:50:02,680
Tim.

1178
00:50:02,680 --> 00:50:03,680
Tim.

1179
00:50:03,680 --> 00:50:04,680
Tim.

1180
00:50:04,680 --> 00:50:05,680
Just a disclaimer, you've got to eat that mic.

1181
00:50:05,680 --> 00:50:06,680
Yeah.

1182
00:50:06,680 --> 00:50:07,680
The sound just disappears.

1183
00:50:07,680 --> 00:50:08,680
Levels?

1184
00:50:08,680 --> 00:50:09,680
Levels.

1185
00:50:09,680 --> 00:50:10,680
You're great.

1186
00:50:10,680 --> 00:50:11,680
We're going to shut up and let you talk, too.

1187
00:50:11,680 --> 00:50:12,680
It's just a dead room, they told us.

1188
00:50:12,680 --> 00:50:13,680
I should be teaching a first aid course.

1189
00:50:13,680 --> 00:50:14,680
One more question, Danny DeVito.

1190
00:50:14,680 --> 00:50:15,680
Yes.

1191
00:50:15,680 --> 00:50:16,680
Yes.

1192
00:50:16,680 --> 00:50:17,680
Sorry.

1193
00:50:17,680 --> 00:50:18,680
Go ahead.

1194
00:50:18,680 --> 00:50:22,600
So I should be teaching a first aid course this weekend, but when I saw the opportunity

1195
00:50:22,600 --> 00:50:26,800
to come see you guys live, my best friend stepped in and said he would teach the course

1196
00:50:26,800 --> 00:50:33,020
for me, and how do I pay someone back for a treat like this, and I don't count John because

1197
00:50:33,020 --> 00:50:34,560
you weren't part of the original deal.

1198
00:50:34,560 --> 00:50:35,560
Fair.

1199
00:50:35,560 --> 00:50:37,120
No, he's only sweetened it.

1200
00:50:37,120 --> 00:50:38,120
Amazing.

1201
00:50:38,120 --> 00:50:40,560
I was going to get him an Xbox, but in light of recent events-

1202
00:50:40,560 --> 00:50:41,560
No, fuck it.

1203
00:50:41,560 --> 00:50:42,560
Are you kidding me?

1204
00:50:42,560 --> 00:50:43,560
Xbox.

1205
00:50:43,560 --> 00:50:44,560
Xbox.

1206
00:50:44,560 --> 00:50:45,560
Xbox.

1207
00:50:45,560 --> 00:50:46,560
Not so much.

1208
00:50:46,560 --> 00:50:47,560
So I just don't know if you have any ideas.

1209
00:50:47,560 --> 00:50:48,560
Commencer it for the amount of appointments.

1210
00:50:48,560 --> 00:50:49,560
Have you thought about a PlayStation 4?

1211
00:50:49,560 --> 00:50:50,560
Yeah.

1212
00:50:50,560 --> 00:50:51,560
It's a good one.

1213
00:50:51,560 --> 00:50:52,560
It's a solid get.

1214
00:50:52,560 --> 00:50:53,560
Have you considered a subscription to CISO?

1215
00:50:53,560 --> 00:50:54,560
What was the-

1216
00:50:54,560 --> 00:50:56,560
There's a lot of great programming on CISO.

1217
00:50:56,560 --> 00:50:57,560
Beautiful.

1218
00:50:57,560 --> 00:50:58,560
All good.

1219
00:50:58,560 --> 00:50:59,560
What was the course you were going to take?

1220
00:50:59,560 --> 00:51:01,040
I was going to teach a first aid course.

1221
00:51:01,040 --> 00:51:02,440
You were going to teach a first aid course.

1222
00:51:02,440 --> 00:51:04,440
Is your friend qualified to do this?

1223
00:51:04,440 --> 00:51:05,440
Super not.

1224
00:51:05,440 --> 00:51:06,440
All right, here's the thing.

1225
00:51:06,440 --> 00:51:07,800
The heartbeat is super important.

1226
00:51:07,800 --> 00:51:10,760
You got to keep a bunch of blood in there all at once.

1227
00:51:10,760 --> 00:51:12,960
If you see blood outside, bummer.

1228
00:51:12,960 --> 00:51:13,960
That's bad.

1229
00:51:13,960 --> 00:51:14,960
That's bad.

1230
00:51:14,960 --> 00:51:15,960
That's bad.

1231
00:51:15,960 --> 00:51:16,960
That's bad.

1232
00:51:16,960 --> 00:51:17,960
Okay.

1233
00:51:17,960 --> 00:51:18,960
Were you going to be paid to teach this course?

1234
00:51:18,960 --> 00:51:19,960
No.

1235
00:51:19,960 --> 00:51:20,960
Volunteer.

1236
00:51:20,960 --> 00:51:21,960
Then you should have just not done it.

1237
00:51:21,960 --> 00:51:22,960
He's giving up a weekend.

1238
00:51:22,960 --> 00:51:23,960
Just don't come.

1239
00:51:23,960 --> 00:51:24,960
Just don't go.

1240
00:51:24,960 --> 00:51:27,560
Just don't arrive at the time you're supposed to.

1241
00:51:27,560 --> 00:51:29,560
But now I'm on audio and they know I'm here.

1242
00:51:29,560 --> 00:51:30,560
What are they going to do?

1243
00:51:30,560 --> 00:51:31,560
Not pay you?

1244
00:51:31,560 --> 00:51:32,560
Well, you're fine.

1245
00:51:32,560 --> 00:51:34,320
Just don't go.

1246
00:51:34,320 --> 00:51:37,180
So I figured I'd say thank you on the mic to him because I'm going to play this episode

1247
00:51:37,180 --> 00:51:38,180
for him to say thank you.

1248
00:51:38,180 --> 00:51:39,180
Oh, so you're just fucking losing yourself.

1249
00:51:39,180 --> 00:51:40,180
We're going to edit this out.

1250
00:51:40,180 --> 00:51:42,320
We're going to edit this out, Tim.

1251
00:51:42,320 --> 00:51:43,320
No free ride.

1252
00:51:43,320 --> 00:51:44,320
It's a fun arrangement.

1253
00:51:44,320 --> 00:51:46,400
You got to buy a Jumbotron.

1254
00:51:46,400 --> 00:51:49,920
By the way, if any of you are thinking about going to that Saturday night volunteer first

1255
00:51:49,920 --> 00:51:54,240
aid course, I would say don't bother.

1256
00:51:54,240 --> 00:51:55,520
The party courts they call it.

1257
00:51:55,520 --> 00:51:56,520
Let's do this.

1258
00:51:56,520 --> 00:51:57,520
Let's do this.

1259
00:51:57,520 --> 00:51:58,520
How many people are going to be at the first aid course?

1260
00:51:58,520 --> 00:51:59,520
How many people?

1261
00:51:59,520 --> 00:52:00,520
About 40.

1262
00:52:00,520 --> 00:52:01,520
40.

1263
00:52:01,520 --> 00:52:02,520
Jesus.

1264
00:52:02,520 --> 00:52:03,520
That's a lot.

1265
00:52:03,520 --> 00:52:04,520
This bit may not work then.

1266
00:52:04,520 --> 00:52:05,520
I was going to say just give...

1267
00:52:05,520 --> 00:52:06,520
There's like a thousand people here.

1268
00:52:06,520 --> 00:52:10,360
Just give them like a little nug, like a little first aid nug, like the first like most important

1269
00:52:10,360 --> 00:52:11,360
like keep the blood inside.

1270
00:52:11,360 --> 00:52:12,360
Right now.

1271
00:52:12,360 --> 00:52:13,360
So no bleeding.

1272
00:52:13,360 --> 00:52:14,360
Right.

1273
00:52:14,360 --> 00:52:15,360
It better not be a joke.

1274
00:52:15,360 --> 00:52:16,360
I want to learn something.

1275
00:52:16,360 --> 00:52:17,360
First, don't bleed.

1276
00:52:17,360 --> 00:52:18,360
Don't bleed?

1277
00:52:18,360 --> 00:52:19,360
Right.

1278
00:52:19,360 --> 00:52:20,360
Okay.

1279
00:52:20,360 --> 00:52:21,360
But if they're already doing that, then like...

1280
00:52:21,360 --> 00:52:22,360
Oh, then stop it.

1281
00:52:22,360 --> 00:52:23,360
Stop it.

1282
00:52:23,360 --> 00:52:24,360
All right.

1283
00:52:24,360 --> 00:52:25,360
There we go.

1284
00:52:25,360 --> 00:52:26,360
Great.

1285
00:52:26,360 --> 00:52:27,360
Tim, everybody.

1286
00:52:27,360 --> 00:52:28,360
Tim.

1287
00:52:28,360 --> 00:52:29,360
All right.

1288
00:52:29,360 --> 00:52:30,360
Who's next?

1289
00:52:30,360 --> 00:52:31,360
I see this hand.

1290
00:52:31,360 --> 00:52:32,360
I saw this hand go really fast front row.

1291
00:52:32,360 --> 00:52:33,360
Come on down.

1292
00:52:33,360 --> 00:52:34,360
You did it.

1293
00:52:34,360 --> 00:52:35,360
You did it.

1294
00:52:35,360 --> 00:52:36,360
Come on down.

1295
00:52:36,360 --> 00:52:37,360
Okay.

1296
00:52:37,360 --> 00:52:38,360
My name is Allison.

1297
00:52:38,360 --> 00:52:39,360
Hi, Allison.

1298
00:52:39,360 --> 00:52:40,360
Hi, Allison.

1299
00:52:40,360 --> 00:52:41,360
So John, I have to tell you, I have a really good friend who used to work at The Daily

1300
00:52:41,360 --> 00:52:42,360
Show.

1301
00:52:42,360 --> 00:52:43,360
Come on.

1302
00:52:43,360 --> 00:52:44,360
It's our show.

1303
00:52:44,360 --> 00:52:45,360
I'm sorry.

1304
00:52:45,360 --> 00:52:46,360
I'm sorry.

1305
00:52:46,360 --> 00:52:47,360
Come on.

1306
00:52:47,360 --> 00:52:48,360
Do you...

1307
00:52:48,360 --> 00:52:49,360
John.

1308
00:52:49,360 --> 00:52:50,360
Hi, Allison.

1309
00:52:50,360 --> 00:52:51,360
How are you?

1310
00:52:51,360 --> 00:52:52,360
I'm fine back here.

1311
00:52:52,360 --> 00:52:53,360
I'm going to tweet more about my TV show.

1312
00:52:53,360 --> 00:52:55,360
John, do you know my friend Jocelyn who used to work at The Daily Show?

1313
00:52:55,360 --> 00:52:56,360
Sure.

1314
00:52:56,360 --> 00:52:57,360
Of course I know Jocelyn.

1315
00:52:57,360 --> 00:52:58,360
Yeah, we're good friends.

1316
00:52:58,360 --> 00:52:59,360
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1317
00:52:59,360 --> 00:53:00,360
Oh, fantastic.

1318
00:53:00,360 --> 00:53:01,360
I hate Jocelyn.

1319
00:53:01,360 --> 00:53:02,360
Yeah, she stinks.

1320
00:53:02,360 --> 00:53:03,360
Boo.

1321
00:53:03,360 --> 00:53:04,360
Jocelyn is made of farts.

1322
00:53:04,360 --> 00:53:05,360
Let me tell you.

1323
00:53:05,360 --> 00:53:07,640
We're all making a big mistake because she's a lovely woman.

1324
00:53:07,640 --> 00:53:08,640
I bet.

1325
00:53:08,640 --> 00:53:09,640
Made of farts.

1326
00:53:09,640 --> 00:53:10,640
She is.

1327
00:53:10,640 --> 00:53:12,880
And my whole point is that you were very nice to me.

1328
00:53:12,880 --> 00:53:13,880
I met you before once.

1329
00:53:13,880 --> 00:53:14,880
You probably don't remember, but it was...

1330
00:53:14,880 --> 00:53:15,880
I don't.

1331
00:53:15,880 --> 00:53:16,880
It was great.

1332
00:53:16,880 --> 00:53:19,280
It was great for me.

1333
00:53:19,280 --> 00:53:20,280
Were you with Jocelyn?

1334
00:53:20,280 --> 00:53:21,280
Yeah, I was.

1335
00:53:21,280 --> 00:53:22,280
Yeah, I still don't remember.

1336
00:53:22,280 --> 00:53:26,640
I bet you're regretting not pointing your question at us, huh?

1337
00:53:26,640 --> 00:53:28,120
We would have remembered you.

1338
00:53:28,120 --> 00:53:30,360
But anyway, nice to see you again.

1339
00:53:30,360 --> 00:53:32,080
Oh, it's great to see you as well.

1340
00:53:32,080 --> 00:53:33,080
My question...

1341
00:53:33,080 --> 00:53:38,580
Is there something for our desk that we have here?

1342
00:53:38,580 --> 00:53:39,760
We have an inbox.

1343
00:53:39,760 --> 00:53:40,760
It's empty.

1344
00:53:40,760 --> 00:53:42,080
We have an outbox for trash.

1345
00:53:42,080 --> 00:53:43,800
I think she's transitioning to the question.

1346
00:53:43,800 --> 00:53:44,800
I am.

1347
00:53:44,800 --> 00:53:45,800
I am indeed.

1348
00:53:45,800 --> 00:53:52,840
So my question is, I was introduced to my Bim Bam about a year ago by a guy, and I'm

1349
00:53:52,840 --> 00:53:55,440
about to turn 31.

1350
00:53:55,440 --> 00:53:56,440
And it's fine.

1351
00:53:56,440 --> 00:53:57,640
It didn't work out, but it was cool.

1352
00:53:57,640 --> 00:53:59,520
I'm totally mature and whatever.

1353
00:53:59,520 --> 00:54:00,520
It's fine.

1354
00:54:00,520 --> 00:54:10,840
Mature people usually do say stuff like that, so whatever.

1355
00:54:10,840 --> 00:54:13,200
But I'm totally great and successful and whatever.

1356
00:54:13,200 --> 00:54:14,200
It's fine.

1357
00:54:14,200 --> 00:54:15,200
My life is great.

1358
00:54:15,200 --> 00:54:16,200
I'm doing great.

1359
00:54:16,200 --> 00:54:17,200
It's fucking sick.

1360
00:54:17,200 --> 00:54:18,200
Yeah.

1361
00:54:18,200 --> 00:54:19,200
You're doing great.

1362
00:54:19,200 --> 00:54:22,200
Hey, can I ask you some advice questions?

1363
00:54:22,200 --> 00:54:29,480
But I introduced one of my really very good friends from college to my Bim Bam, and he

1364
00:54:29,480 --> 00:54:30,480
loves it.

1365
00:54:30,480 --> 00:54:36,360
However, his wife, who also happens to be one of my best friends, is not as interested.

1366
00:54:36,360 --> 00:54:37,360
Cool.

1367
00:54:37,360 --> 00:54:38,360
By the way, this is quite an emotional journey.

1368
00:54:38,360 --> 00:54:39,360
I agree.

1369
00:54:39,360 --> 00:54:41,800
Yeah, this is like, I'm going to need a flow chart.

1370
00:54:41,800 --> 00:54:44,600
So some people like us, some people don't, and you're doing great.

1371
00:54:44,600 --> 00:54:45,600
Yeah.

1372
00:54:45,600 --> 00:54:54,120
So honest, we're like 50-50, you're 100% rad, and also you have a friend who knows John.

1373
00:54:54,120 --> 00:54:55,120
Yeah.

1374
00:54:55,120 --> 00:54:56,120
I have picked up all the details.

1375
00:54:56,120 --> 00:54:59,080
The key to writing a fantasy novel is world building.

1376
00:54:59,080 --> 00:55:07,800
Sorry, did you say your name was Griffin McElroy's Twitter mentions?

1377
00:55:07,800 --> 00:55:14,240
No, but for real, are you asking us like how to get your friend on board with our brand

1378
00:55:14,240 --> 00:55:15,240
of comedy?

1379
00:55:15,240 --> 00:55:19,080
Yeah, because there's two of us now, and we have good taste, and we're strong, and we

1380
00:55:19,080 --> 00:55:24,120
believe in ourselves, but this one other person outlier is not into it.

1381
00:55:24,120 --> 00:55:25,920
How do we convince?

1382
00:55:25,920 --> 00:55:26,920
Who is the person?

1383
00:55:26,920 --> 00:55:27,920
I'm confused.

1384
00:55:27,920 --> 00:55:28,920
Who's the person?

1385
00:55:28,920 --> 00:55:29,920
No one.

1386
00:55:29,920 --> 00:55:30,920
It's not Jocelyn.

1387
00:55:30,920 --> 00:55:31,920
It's no one you know.

1388
00:55:31,920 --> 00:55:32,920
No, no, no.

1389
00:55:32,920 --> 00:55:33,920
Everyone loves you, John.

1390
00:55:33,920 --> 00:55:34,920
Don't worry.

1391
00:55:34,920 --> 00:55:35,920
Yeah, don't worry.

1392
00:55:35,920 --> 00:55:36,920
So this is your friend's wife.

1393
00:55:36,920 --> 00:55:40,720
Yeah, who happens to be also my very good friend.

1394
00:55:40,720 --> 00:55:41,720
Like do they try?

1395
00:55:41,720 --> 00:55:42,720
They don't try.

1396
00:55:42,720 --> 00:55:43,720
Are they unaware?

1397
00:55:43,720 --> 00:55:44,720
Are they trying?

1398
00:55:44,720 --> 00:55:45,720
They're like, eh, eh.

1399
00:55:45,720 --> 00:55:46,720
Do they know we have a TV show now?

1400
00:55:46,720 --> 00:55:47,720
Yeah.

1401
00:55:47,720 --> 00:55:48,720
We're like multimedia.

1402
00:55:48,720 --> 00:55:49,720
Maybe they'll prefer like a visual medium.

1403
00:55:49,720 --> 00:55:50,720
To be fair.

1404
00:55:50,720 --> 00:55:51,720
Probably not.

1405
00:55:51,720 --> 00:55:52,720
To be fair.

1406
00:55:52,720 --> 00:55:53,720
I've tried.

1407
00:55:53,720 --> 00:55:56,720
I've tried, but her husband like walks around the house like laughing to himself, which

1408
00:55:56,720 --> 00:55:57,720
is not very cool.

1409
00:55:57,720 --> 00:55:58,720
No, that's not it.

1410
00:55:58,720 --> 00:55:59,720
No, no, no.

1411
00:55:59,720 --> 00:56:00,720
That's not really how you sell anything.

1412
00:56:00,720 --> 00:56:01,720
What are you laughing at?

1413
00:56:01,720 --> 00:56:02,720
No, you can't hear it.

1414
00:56:02,720 --> 00:56:03,720
Be quiet.

1415
00:56:03,720 --> 00:56:11,720
Listen, I've spent a lot of time with baby Charlie over the last two days.

1416
00:56:11,720 --> 00:56:15,200
To get someone interested in something, you have to be withholding of it.

1417
00:56:15,200 --> 00:56:18,120
So what has to happen is your friend has to laugh at it, and when she's like, what is

1418
00:56:18,120 --> 00:56:19,120
it like?

1419
00:56:19,120 --> 00:56:20,120
It's not for you.

1420
00:56:20,120 --> 00:56:21,120
No, no, no.

1421
00:56:21,120 --> 00:56:22,120
It's only for cool, mature people.

1422
00:56:22,120 --> 00:56:23,920
This is just for cool, mature people who are doing great financially.

1423
00:56:23,920 --> 00:56:26,920
It's not for you babies.

1424
00:56:26,920 --> 00:56:28,920
Babies wouldn't appreciate our show.

1425
00:56:28,920 --> 00:56:29,920
It's a grown-up podcast.

1426
00:56:29,920 --> 00:56:32,920
You do that enough, and pretty soon you'll catch her listening to it.

1427
00:56:32,920 --> 00:56:34,920
I'm like, I had to find out what all the fuss was about.

1428
00:56:34,920 --> 00:56:35,920
I'm like, welcome.

1429
00:56:35,920 --> 00:56:36,920
Yeah, welcome to the family.

1430
00:56:36,920 --> 00:56:37,920
Come with me.

1431
00:56:37,920 --> 00:56:38,920
Do they live in the area?

1432
00:56:38,920 --> 00:56:39,920
Yeah, we all live in New York.

1433
00:56:39,920 --> 00:56:40,920
Is she here?

1434
00:56:40,920 --> 00:56:41,920
No, she's not.

1435
00:56:41,920 --> 00:56:42,920
I had to take it.

1436
00:56:42,920 --> 00:56:43,920
That would have been a great onboard though.

1437
00:56:43,920 --> 00:56:48,480
If they live in the area, it's probably pretty good they didn't get into the show, because

1438
00:56:48,480 --> 00:56:49,480
we ain't got no more seats.

1439
00:56:49,480 --> 00:56:50,480
What's up?

1440
00:56:50,480 --> 00:57:00,160
I've had a TV show for 30 minutes, and I fucking lost it.

1441
00:57:00,160 --> 00:57:02,640
I'm an insane person.

1442
00:57:02,640 --> 00:57:04,080
Is her husband here?

1443
00:57:04,080 --> 00:57:06,400
Hey, you did great.

1444
00:57:06,400 --> 00:57:07,400
You guys are together.

1445
00:57:07,400 --> 00:57:08,400
Oh, that's fantastic.

1446
00:57:08,400 --> 00:57:09,400
Okay.

1447
00:57:09,400 --> 00:57:10,400
Here's a solution.

1448
00:57:10,400 --> 00:57:11,400
You leave your wife.

1449
00:57:11,400 --> 00:57:12,400
Jesus.

1450
00:57:12,400 --> 00:57:13,400
Oh, no.

1451
00:57:13,400 --> 00:57:14,400
John, John.

1452
00:57:14,400 --> 00:57:15,400
Wait, wait, wait.

1453
00:57:15,400 --> 00:57:16,400
No, no, hold on.

1454
00:57:16,400 --> 00:57:17,400
John, John, John, John, John, John, John.

1455
00:57:17,400 --> 00:57:23,080
And you guys- John, John, John, John, it's your first time here.

1456
00:57:23,080 --> 00:57:25,120
Justin's literally covering his ears like a child would do.

1457
00:57:25,120 --> 00:57:26,120
John, John, no.

1458
00:57:26,120 --> 00:57:27,120
Not about John.

1459
00:57:27,120 --> 00:57:28,120
No.

1460
00:57:28,120 --> 00:57:29,120
We have samplers on YouTube.

1461
00:57:29,120 --> 00:57:31,320
There are easier ways to go about this.

1462
00:57:31,320 --> 00:57:33,680
Please try our samplers on YouTube.

1463
00:57:33,680 --> 00:57:35,240
Please.

1464
00:57:35,240 --> 00:57:36,240
Maybe get her a t-shirt.

1465
00:57:36,240 --> 00:57:37,240
They're great.

1466
00:57:37,240 --> 00:57:39,800
You guys know this is where this is going.

1467
00:57:39,800 --> 00:57:40,800
Just go.

1468
00:57:40,800 --> 00:57:41,800
It wasn't.

1469
00:57:41,800 --> 00:57:42,800
It wasn't.

1470
00:57:42,800 --> 00:57:43,800
It wasn't.

1471
00:57:43,800 --> 00:57:47,680
Justin is shipping our audience who are doing her best up here.

1472
00:57:47,680 --> 00:57:48,680
Who's next?

1473
00:57:48,680 --> 00:57:49,680
Let's get someone from over there.

1474
00:57:49,680 --> 00:57:51,680
I see somebody in a white jacket over there.

1475
00:57:51,680 --> 00:57:52,680
Yes, you're waving your hand.

1476
00:57:52,680 --> 00:57:53,680
Yes, yes, yes.

1477
00:57:53,680 --> 00:57:54,680
The one who applauded.

1478
00:57:54,680 --> 00:57:55,680
Come on down.

1479
00:57:55,680 --> 00:57:56,680
The one who applauded when we picked you.

1480
00:57:56,680 --> 00:57:57,680
That's wonderful.

1481
00:57:57,680 --> 00:57:58,680
Hi.

1482
00:57:58,680 --> 00:57:59,680
What's your name?

1483
00:57:59,680 --> 00:58:00,680
Hi.

1484
00:58:00,680 --> 00:58:01,680
My name is Dani.

1485
00:58:01,680 --> 00:58:02,680
Hi, Dani.

1486
00:58:02,680 --> 00:58:03,680
Hi, Dani.

1487
00:58:03,680 --> 00:58:04,680
First of all, I'm wearing a Kung Fu Panda 3.

1488
00:58:04,680 --> 00:58:05,680
Fuck yeah.

1489
00:58:05,680 --> 00:58:06,680
Yeah.

1490
00:58:06,680 --> 00:58:07,680
Have you seen it?

1491
00:58:07,680 --> 00:58:08,680
It's so good, dude.

1492
00:58:08,680 --> 00:58:13,280
I was interning at DreamWorks when that episode came out.

1493
00:58:13,280 --> 00:58:14,880
Holy shit.

1494
00:58:14,880 --> 00:58:15,880
They must have been...

1495
00:58:15,880 --> 00:58:16,880
And you played it for Jim DreamWorks?

1496
00:58:16,880 --> 00:58:19,880
They must have been so excited to hear us buzzing.

1497
00:58:19,880 --> 00:58:21,880
I almost got fired.

1498
00:58:21,880 --> 00:58:22,880
No.

1499
00:58:22,880 --> 00:58:29,560
So my question is, I have had a childhood friend since we were in second grade.

1500
00:58:29,560 --> 00:58:33,840
Unfortunately, it has kind of turned into a hate kind of thing.

1501
00:58:33,840 --> 00:58:34,840
Okay.

1502
00:58:34,840 --> 00:58:35,840
Cool.

1503
00:58:35,840 --> 00:58:37,640
But this is a long journey, but...

1504
00:58:37,640 --> 00:58:42,280
You're on the razor's edge of Bummer County.

1505
00:58:42,280 --> 00:58:43,280
No, no, no.

1506
00:58:43,280 --> 00:58:44,280
No, no, no.

1507
00:58:44,280 --> 00:58:45,280
No.

1508
00:58:45,280 --> 00:58:46,280
I got this.

1509
00:58:46,280 --> 00:58:47,280
Okay.

1510
00:58:47,280 --> 00:58:48,280
But I really love his mom.

1511
00:58:48,280 --> 00:58:57,640
She's like a second mom to me, and she is trying to pay me to tutor his little brother.

1512
00:58:57,640 --> 00:58:58,640
Layer upon layer.

1513
00:58:58,640 --> 00:58:59,640
This is an onion, Dani.

1514
00:58:59,640 --> 00:59:00,640
Go on.

1515
00:59:00,640 --> 00:59:08,040
So what I'm trying to figure out is how do I avoid that guy while getting paid?

1516
00:59:08,040 --> 00:59:09,040
You don't.

1517
00:59:09,040 --> 00:59:11,040
You rub it right in his face.

1518
00:59:11,040 --> 00:59:12,520
You are getting paid to be in his house.

1519
00:59:12,520 --> 00:59:16,320
He is there for free.

1520
00:59:16,320 --> 00:59:21,560
You are the grim specter that haunts him for all his days.

1521
00:59:21,560 --> 00:59:22,560
What's...

1522
00:59:22,560 --> 00:59:24,200
I shouldn't ask what the friend's name is.

1523
00:59:24,200 --> 00:59:25,680
That's probably a little too personal.

1524
00:59:25,680 --> 00:59:31,480
Let's just call him Chad, and he'll be like, hey, Chad, you got any little debbies like

1525
00:59:31,480 --> 00:59:32,480
you usually have?

1526
00:59:32,480 --> 00:59:34,280
I guess your mom doesn't have money for that anymore.

1527
00:59:34,280 --> 00:59:35,280
Wonder where it went.

1528
00:59:35,280 --> 00:59:38,280
Flip, flip, flip, flip, flip, flip, flip, flip, flip, flip, flip, flip, flip, flip, flip,

1529
00:59:38,280 --> 00:59:39,280
flip, flip, flip.

1530
00:59:39,280 --> 00:59:40,280
Your brother can do math now.

1531
00:59:40,280 --> 00:59:41,280
You Chad, I'm out.

1532
00:59:41,280 --> 00:59:42,280
Thank you.

1533
00:59:42,280 --> 00:59:43,280
You're welcome.

1534
00:59:43,280 --> 00:59:44,280
Oh, that's it.

1535
00:59:44,280 --> 00:59:45,280
Oh, we did it.

1536
00:59:45,280 --> 00:59:46,280
Cool.

1537
00:59:46,280 --> 00:59:47,280
Yep.

1538
00:59:47,280 --> 00:59:48,280
Fucking fixed it.

1539
00:59:48,280 --> 00:59:49,280
Got it in one.

1540
00:59:49,280 --> 00:59:50,280
Wait.

1541
00:59:50,280 --> 00:59:51,280
You pick.

1542
00:59:51,280 --> 00:59:52,280
Right here in the middle, because we never do in the middle.

1543
00:59:52,280 --> 00:59:53,280
Right here with the pink hair.

1544
00:59:53,280 --> 00:59:54,280
Yes.

1545
00:59:54,280 --> 00:59:55,280
Yes.

1546
00:59:55,280 --> 00:59:56,280
You got it.

1547
00:59:56,280 --> 00:59:57,280
Here with the cool hair.

1548
00:59:57,280 --> 00:59:58,280
Come on.

1549
00:59:58,280 --> 01:00:05,680
I feel like you didn't get a hand on that ball, the Tudor ball.

1550
01:00:05,680 --> 01:00:06,680
You okay with that?

1551
01:00:06,680 --> 01:00:07,680
I'm just fine.

1552
01:00:07,680 --> 01:00:08,680
Okay.

1553
01:00:08,680 --> 01:00:09,680
Hey.

1554
01:00:09,680 --> 01:00:10,680
Hi.

1555
01:00:10,680 --> 01:00:11,680
What's your name?

1556
01:00:11,680 --> 01:00:12,680
I'm Jessica.

1557
01:00:12,680 --> 01:00:13,680
Hi, Jessica.

1558
01:00:13,680 --> 01:00:14,680
I'm Justin.

1559
01:00:14,680 --> 01:00:18,680
So I discovered Maximum Fun while I was pregnant with my second child.

1560
01:00:18,680 --> 01:00:19,680
Really?

1561
01:00:19,680 --> 01:00:20,680
Named Moxie.

1562
01:00:20,680 --> 01:00:21,680
That's cool.

1563
01:00:21,680 --> 01:00:22,680
That's cool.

1564
01:00:22,680 --> 01:00:23,680
We're now-

1565
01:00:23,680 --> 01:00:26,920
I saw a few people nodding approvingly.

1566
01:00:26,920 --> 01:00:30,480
I think the ship has sailed.

1567
01:00:30,480 --> 01:00:32,360
Did Moxie sponsor your child?

1568
01:00:32,360 --> 01:00:35,040
Because they didn't sponsor my goddamn podcast.

1569
01:00:35,040 --> 01:00:37,440
Moxie did sponsor your podcast.

1570
01:00:37,440 --> 01:00:38,440
Oh, no, no.

1571
01:00:38,440 --> 01:00:39,440
Don't.

1572
01:00:39,440 --> 01:00:40,440
Don't.

1573
01:00:40,440 --> 01:00:41,440
Go on with your question.

1574
01:00:41,440 --> 01:00:42,440
Yeah.

1575
01:00:42,440 --> 01:00:43,440
We sent you some money.

1576
01:00:43,440 --> 01:00:44,440
So how can we help you?

1577
01:00:44,440 --> 01:00:47,400
Or did you just want to talk to John like you're crazy?

1578
01:00:47,400 --> 01:00:50,960
So John helped name my second child.

1579
01:00:50,960 --> 01:00:51,960
Okay.

1580
01:00:51,960 --> 01:00:52,960
So the second one-

1581
01:00:52,960 --> 01:00:54,520
I need you guys to help name my third child.

1582
01:00:54,520 --> 01:00:56,520
Hell yeah.

1583
01:00:56,520 --> 01:00:58,240
Have you considered-

1584
01:00:58,240 --> 01:01:00,320
It has to start with an M.

1585
01:01:00,320 --> 01:01:01,320
M?

1586
01:01:01,320 --> 01:01:02,320
Okay.

1587
01:01:02,320 --> 01:01:07,320
How about extreme restraints?

1588
01:01:07,320 --> 01:01:16,200
What about just mmm and you call them mmm for short?

1589
01:01:16,200 --> 01:01:17,200
What about Mbembe?

1590
01:01:17,200 --> 01:01:18,200
Yeah.

1591
01:01:18,200 --> 01:01:23,200
Yeah, you really set us up easy for that one.

1592
01:01:23,200 --> 01:01:24,200
McElroy.

1593
01:01:24,200 --> 01:01:25,200
What McElroy?

1594
01:01:25,200 --> 01:01:26,200
McElroy's such a good name.

1595
01:01:26,200 --> 01:01:28,240
I figured you guys would have enough M names to suggest.

1596
01:01:28,240 --> 01:01:29,240
Macklemore.

1597
01:01:29,240 --> 01:01:30,800
Shit no.

1598
01:01:30,800 --> 01:01:32,960
Have you-

1599
01:01:32,960 --> 01:01:43,840
I've never met a person with the name money, but I kind of love it.

1600
01:01:43,840 --> 01:01:45,000
I'm money.

1601
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:46,000
You know me.

1602
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:47,000
You know my style.

1603
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:48,000
You know me.

1604
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:49,000
I'm money.

1605
01:01:49,000 --> 01:01:50,000
Are you quoting swingers?

1606
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:51,000
No.

1607
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:58,200
Here's my driver's license.

1608
01:01:58,200 --> 01:02:00,000
I'm 115 years old.

1609
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:02,000
I'm Benjamin Buttoning out.

1610
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:08,920
Have you thought about Mark, but said with like a fun way, like Merck?

1611
01:02:08,920 --> 01:02:13,360
Like if somebody's having fun with a guy named Mark, they're not just going to say, hey Mark.

1612
01:02:13,360 --> 01:02:14,360
Never.

1613
01:02:14,360 --> 01:02:15,360
Hey Mark.

1614
01:02:15,360 --> 01:02:17,680
I would have to say that's a winner, but we already used that one.

1615
01:02:17,680 --> 01:02:18,680
Son of a bitch.

1616
01:02:18,680 --> 01:02:19,680
What about Mark all caps?

1617
01:02:19,680 --> 01:02:23,680
So it's like this is Mark and this is brother Mark.

1618
01:02:23,680 --> 01:02:24,680
Wait a minute.

1619
01:02:24,680 --> 01:02:27,920
This is for your third child.

1620
01:02:27,920 --> 01:02:28,920
Number one is Mark.

1621
01:02:28,920 --> 01:02:29,920
Yeah.

1622
01:02:29,920 --> 01:02:30,920
Number two is Moxie.

1623
01:02:30,920 --> 01:02:31,920
Yeah.

1624
01:02:31,920 --> 01:02:37,280
You have to stop that.

1625
01:02:37,280 --> 01:02:39,520
Might I suggest these are, these are human beings.

1626
01:02:39,520 --> 01:02:50,240
You understand that they're not your craft project.

1627
01:02:50,240 --> 01:02:52,480
Come up with something else.

1628
01:02:52,480 --> 01:02:57,960
You can maybe combine the two older boys names and call him Marks.

1629
01:02:57,960 --> 01:02:58,960
Yeah.

1630
01:02:58,960 --> 01:02:59,960
That's good.

1631
01:02:59,960 --> 01:03:00,960
Marksy for short.

1632
01:03:00,960 --> 01:03:01,960
Or mock.

1633
01:03:01,960 --> 01:03:02,960
I am mock.

1634
01:03:02,960 --> 01:03:03,960
I'm excited for school.

1635
01:03:03,960 --> 01:03:04,960
Thank you for the PB&J mother.

1636
01:03:04,960 --> 01:03:05,960
Mock desires applesauce.

1637
01:03:05,960 --> 01:03:06,960
You will bring mock applesauce.

1638
01:03:06,960 --> 01:03:07,960
You are mother.

1639
01:03:07,960 --> 01:03:08,960
Do as I say.

1640
01:03:08,960 --> 01:03:09,960
You do as mock.

1641
01:03:09,960 --> 01:03:10,960
All are become mock.

1642
01:03:10,960 --> 01:03:11,960
Hey Modoc at some point.

1643
01:03:11,960 --> 01:03:12,960
Hey Modoc.

1644
01:03:12,960 --> 01:03:13,960
Hey.

1645
01:03:13,960 --> 01:03:14,960
Hey.

1646
01:03:14,960 --> 01:03:15,960
Hey.

1647
01:03:15,960 --> 01:03:16,960
Hey.

1648
01:03:16,960 --> 01:03:17,960
Hey.

1649
01:03:17,960 --> 01:03:18,960
Hey.

1650
01:03:18,960 --> 01:03:19,960
Hey.

1651
01:03:19,960 --> 01:03:20,960
Hey.

1652
01:03:20,960 --> 01:03:21,960
Hey.

1653
01:03:21,960 --> 01:03:22,960
Hey.

1654
01:03:22,960 --> 01:03:23,960
Hey.

1655
01:03:23,960 --> 01:03:24,960
Hey.

1656
01:03:24,960 --> 01:03:25,960
Hey.

1657
01:03:25,960 --> 01:03:26,960
Hey.

1658
01:03:26,960 --> 01:03:27,960
Hey.

1659
01:03:27,960 --> 01:03:28,960
Hey.

1660
01:03:28,960 --> 01:03:29,960
Hey.

1661
01:03:29,960 --> 01:03:30,960
Hey.

1662
01:03:30,960 --> 01:03:31,960
Hey.

1663
01:03:31,960 --> 01:03:32,960
Hey.

1664
01:03:32,960 --> 01:03:33,960
Hey.

1665
01:03:33,960 --> 01:03:34,960
Hey.

1666
01:03:34,960 --> 01:03:35,960
Modoc is very good too.

1667
01:03:35,960 --> 01:03:36,960
What about, hey.

1668
01:03:36,960 --> 01:03:37,960
Hello for babies.

1669
01:03:37,960 --> 01:03:40,900
Kill those were the real gay much play brought to you by play station.

1670
01:03:40,900 --> 01:03:43,160
I hope that answers your question.

1671
01:03:43,160 --> 01:03:44,160
Wait, wait.

1672
01:03:44,160 --> 01:03:46,960
You have to decide.

1673
01:03:46,960 --> 01:03:51,080
Well, Mr. Mr.

1674
01:03:51,080 --> 01:03:57,120
Manzy, but taken Maraites Mandy.

1675
01:03:57,120 --> 01:03:58,380
Mattington.

1676
01:03:58,380 --> 01:03:59,820
I like Manzi a lot better.

1677
01:03:59,820 --> 01:04:01,020
Mustin.

1678
01:04:01,020 --> 01:04:02,540
Mustin McElroy.

1679
01:04:03,640 --> 01:04:04,800
Mavis.

1680
01:04:04,800 --> 01:04:05,860
Mustard Gas.

1681
01:04:05,860 --> 01:04:06,700
Mustard.

1682
01:04:06,700 --> 01:04:08,620
I didn't know what I was getting into when I asked.

1683
01:04:08,620 --> 01:04:10,180
Yeah, you're just getting into a fucking free association.

1684
01:04:10,180 --> 01:04:11,860
You guys literally aren't here right now.

1685
01:04:11,860 --> 01:04:13,180
We're just doing a free association.

1686
01:04:13,180 --> 01:04:14,980
We gave up on words that start with M

1687
01:04:14,980 --> 01:04:16,780
and we're adding the M to other words.

1688
01:04:16,780 --> 01:04:19,220
That's a bad job, huh?

1689
01:04:19,220 --> 01:04:20,380
That's not even humor.

1690
01:04:20,380 --> 01:04:21,900
And now you see my problem.

1691
01:04:21,900 --> 01:04:23,460
My words, my words.

1692
01:04:23,460 --> 01:04:25,340
Just love, love large numbers.

1693
01:04:25,340 --> 01:04:27,220
I think the name was in there somewhere.

1694
01:04:27,220 --> 01:04:28,060
Somewhere. Thank you guys.

1695
01:04:28,060 --> 01:04:28,900
Glad we could help.

1696
01:04:28,900 --> 01:04:29,740
Thank you.

1697
01:04:29,740 --> 01:04:30,560
Let's do one more.

1698
01:04:30,560 --> 01:04:31,400
One more?

1699
01:04:31,400 --> 01:04:32,240
Yeah.

1700
01:04:32,240 --> 01:04:33,060
Right there.

1701
01:04:33,060 --> 01:04:33,900
Yes.

1702
01:04:33,900 --> 01:04:34,740
Red shirt.

1703
01:04:34,740 --> 01:04:35,560
Red shirt.

1704
01:04:35,560 --> 01:04:36,400
Yes, yes, yes.

1705
01:04:36,400 --> 01:04:38,100
Right under, under shirt.

1706
01:04:38,100 --> 01:04:39,020
It says Goosebumps.

1707
01:04:39,020 --> 01:04:40,180
It's clearly a Goosebumps shirt.

1708
01:04:40,180 --> 01:04:41,180
It is a Goosebumps shirt.

1709
01:04:41,180 --> 01:04:42,020
That's so rad.

1710
01:04:42,020 --> 01:04:42,860
Excellent.

1711
01:04:42,860 --> 01:04:43,700
Which one is that?

1712
01:04:43,700 --> 01:04:45,940
It's Night of the Living Dummy.

1713
01:04:45,940 --> 01:04:49,620
I actually, I used my alcohol money on this shirt.

1714
01:04:49,620 --> 01:04:50,460
Because I.

1715
01:04:50,460 --> 01:04:53,740
You are going to be fantastic.

1716
01:04:53,740 --> 01:04:54,940
Yeah.

1717
01:04:54,940 --> 01:04:56,340
Yeah.

1718
01:04:56,340 --> 01:04:57,860
I'm going to say you don't drink enough.

1719
01:04:57,860 --> 01:04:59,100
Yeah.

1720
01:04:59,100 --> 01:05:00,900
So to answer your question, yes, I budget.

1721
01:05:00,900 --> 01:05:03,460
And yes, I'm great at it.

1722
01:05:03,460 --> 01:05:05,020
I have vodka in my freezer.

1723
01:05:05,020 --> 01:05:06,580
I couldn't bring that with me.

1724
01:05:06,580 --> 01:05:07,460
You could have.

1725
01:05:07,460 --> 01:05:08,980
I have to confess a sin.

1726
01:05:08,980 --> 01:05:10,220
Oh shit.

1727
01:05:10,220 --> 01:05:11,140
I murdered.

1728
01:05:11,140 --> 01:05:13,460
Not to, I murder a bunch.

1729
01:05:13,460 --> 01:05:14,300
No.

1730
01:05:14,300 --> 01:05:15,120
You know murder?

1731
01:05:15,120 --> 01:05:16,580
I bought an Xbox.

1732
01:05:16,580 --> 01:05:18,620
Oh, that's a great name for your baby.

1733
01:05:18,620 --> 01:05:19,440
Murder.

1734
01:05:20,780 --> 01:05:21,620
Yeah.

1735
01:05:24,200 --> 01:05:25,040
Okay.

1736
01:05:25,040 --> 01:05:25,860
What did you do?

1737
01:05:25,860 --> 01:05:26,700
What did you do?

1738
01:05:26,700 --> 01:05:30,020
So last year I made my friend listen to all of the Haunted

1739
01:05:30,020 --> 01:05:31,260
Doll Watch segments.

1740
01:05:31,260 --> 01:05:32,100
Okay.

1741
01:05:32,100 --> 01:05:32,940
Sure.

1742
01:05:32,940 --> 01:05:34,820
And she got really into it and started selling dolls

1743
01:05:34,820 --> 01:05:35,660
on eBay.

1744
01:05:37,300 --> 01:05:38,140
Hold on.

1745
01:05:38,140 --> 01:05:39,460
It's becoming Ouroboros.

1746
01:05:39,460 --> 01:05:40,820
It's a snake in its own tail.

1747
01:05:40,820 --> 01:05:44,260
One day we might do a Haunted Doll Watch of your friend's

1748
01:05:44,260 --> 01:05:46,460
Haunted Dolls that we learned about from Haunted Dolls.

1749
01:05:46,460 --> 01:05:47,300
Let her finish because I'm worried.

1750
01:05:47,300 --> 01:05:52,220
See that's the thing is that she hired me to write a couple

1751
01:05:52,220 --> 01:05:53,540
of doll stories.

1752
01:05:53,540 --> 01:05:55,060
You traitor.

1753
01:05:55,060 --> 01:05:59,180
You wrote Haunted Doll stories for eBay?

1754
01:05:59,180 --> 01:06:00,020
She paid me.

1755
01:06:00,020 --> 01:06:00,860
Wait.

1756
01:06:00,860 --> 01:06:01,700
Hold on, hold on.

1757
01:06:01,700 --> 01:06:02,520
Oh shit.

1758
01:06:02,520 --> 01:06:03,780
I'm all about that dollar.

1759
01:06:03,780 --> 01:06:07,260
One of them actually sold and she paid me 25% which amounted

1760
01:06:07,260 --> 01:06:09,900
to $8 consisting of a pair of socks.

1761
01:06:09,900 --> 01:06:11,660
Fuck yeah, dude.

1762
01:06:11,660 --> 01:06:13,780
Kind of a garment based economy.

1763
01:06:13,780 --> 01:06:14,620
Yeah.

1764
01:06:15,500 --> 01:06:16,680
It's kind of the barter system.

1765
01:06:16,680 --> 01:06:19,020
So I just, I needed to confess that I did technically.

1766
01:06:19,020 --> 01:06:19,860
I prodded you.

1767
01:06:19,860 --> 01:06:20,700
Yeah, you're fine.

1768
01:06:20,700 --> 01:06:21,660
I technically prod.

1769
01:06:21,660 --> 01:06:22,480
You're exonerated.

1770
01:06:22,480 --> 01:06:23,320
I still have those socks.

1771
01:06:23,320 --> 01:06:24,160
They're really, really good.

1772
01:06:24,160 --> 01:06:25,000
Nice.

1773
01:06:25,000 --> 01:06:27,100
Guys, two Hawaiian shirts.

1774
01:06:27,100 --> 01:06:28,100
That's the trade.

1775
01:06:28,100 --> 01:06:28,940
And we'll fight over.

1776
01:06:28,940 --> 01:06:29,760
I wish.

1777
01:06:29,760 --> 01:06:30,980
Hawaiian shirts are expensive.

1778
01:06:30,980 --> 01:06:31,800
I know.

1779
01:06:33,980 --> 01:06:35,100
For sure.

1780
01:06:35,100 --> 01:06:35,940
No.

1781
01:06:35,940 --> 01:06:37,140
Thank you all so much for coming.

1782
01:06:37,140 --> 01:06:41,020
Thank you, John, for all of the hard work that you've done.

1783
01:06:42,420 --> 01:06:44,420
A big thank you to the PlayStation Theater.

1784
01:06:44,420 --> 01:06:45,260
Yeah, seriously.

1785
01:06:45,260 --> 01:06:46,100
Fuck Xbox.

1786
01:06:46,100 --> 01:06:46,920
Fuck Xbox.

1787
01:06:46,920 --> 01:06:47,760
Fuck Xbox for real.

1788
01:06:47,760 --> 01:06:49,300
Blink's the time sweeper.

1789
01:06:49,300 --> 01:06:50,700
I can't even say your name.

1790
01:06:50,700 --> 01:06:51,820
Good sequel you did.

1791
01:06:51,820 --> 01:06:53,060
Oh wait, did he do a sequel?

1792
01:06:53,060 --> 01:06:53,900
He did.

1793
01:06:53,900 --> 01:06:54,720
