1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:30,800
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:51,440
Welcome, my brother, my brother, and me, where we've just finished our yearly viewing

6
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:59,440
of the VMAs. We all gathered together. Hands up, hands up, meta question. Who actually watched

7
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:07,760
them? Because I missed out. I watched Lady Gaga's performance, which was haunting,

8
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:14,080
and then I watched her second one that she did with Robin Thicke, and god, she is a chameleon.

9
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:18,960
You could barely even detect that that was her. She was blending into his suit.

10
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:24,800
Did you know that everyone in the audience is Lady Gaga? They did it with computers.

11
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:29,760
Actually, I heard a rumor that that first part was true, but that it wasn't computers.

12
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:33,760
She just did it? She's amazing. She just fucking did it. She's the first mutant.

13
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:40,720
The gene is making itself known. God, we were going to talk about Miley Cyrus,

14
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:44,640
like this is all anyways fucking talking about. I'm going to hit it from a different angle.

15
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:52,560
She was an embarrassment to furries. Yeah. Miley Cyrus was? Yes. Was she wearing a fursuit? She

16
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:58,000
was convinced that it was about furry. She was in a fucking like had mouse ears on and like

17
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:03,600
was wearing like a mouse bathing suit and everybody was in these weird like almost like

18
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:08,480
those teddy bear plastic toys you get out of like a gumball machine. We should mention Griffin has

19
00:02:08,480 --> 00:02:12,560
been in Germany for the past week where that kind of thing is completely normal. Can I say something

20
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:16,480
without I imagine we have German listeners. I don't want people to think I'm xenophobic because

21
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:22,320
I genuinely do love traveling to Germany. This is this is my second time doing it for work,

22
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:27,760
but the hotel we were staying at had a TV station that was literally 24 hours Nazi documentary,

23
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:37,120
like a like an old timey like like a like a TV news special on on the whole Nazi thing.

24
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:42,080
And they showed it like literally like around the clock. Every time we ate dinner at the hotel,

25
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:47,680
they had the TV turned to that station. And it's like, guys, this is worse than the Miley Cyrus

26
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:52,640
shit. And that was really bad. I'm not saying that what the things that the Nazis did were worse,

27
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:57,760
but the documentary, the documentary, why are you dredging that shit up? Move on.

28
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:03,920
You've got lots of stuff going for you now. You bail out every country. Yep. You made the

29
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:09,440
new Beatle, which is fantastic. You're not Russia. You're not Russia. Look at that. That's pretty

30
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:14,800
great. Hello, Germany. And we're here to help you. I'm sorry. Morgan thing funny about the

31
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:19,280
Miley. Watch that Miley Cyrus video, I think, is what it's like for most people listening to

32
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:23,520
my brother. My brother and me, there's adults walking around with giant teddy bears on their

33
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:28,160
back. And it's like, yeah, life feels like that sometimes. Listen, that only thing that makes

34
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:32,480
that whole thing worthwhile is every time it cuts to the audience, like you either see like

35
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:40,160
screaming fans or like other like actual musical professionals who just look horrified. I'm gonna

36
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:46,960
say this. Okay. I'm gonna let you guys finish. I'm gonna say this, though. Just let the fucking

37
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:54,320
girl twerk. Let the girl do her goddamn thing. The fucking news people who are making this a big deal

38
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:59,040
are pitching it from the angle of look at what Hannah Montana turned out to be. And it's like,

39
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:03,840
guess what? Everybody fucking grows up. You're the one that's looking at this 20-year-old woman

40
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:07,920
slapping her butt cheeks together in a way that's supposed to be sexually provocative and being

41
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:13,360
like, I wonder what a 12-year-old doing that would look like. You fucking perverts. If you're

42
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:16,960
sharing that link, if you're dropping that link on your Facebook wall, guess what? You're a pervert,

43
00:04:16,960 --> 00:04:23,200
too. I'm the only non-pervert in the room saying this is a 20-year-old woman trying to be sexually

44
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:27,280
provocative by slapping her butt cheeks together like you would your hands after a good theater

45
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:35,280
performance. I cannot tell if you're in favor or against it. I'm neutral on the thing, but what I'm

46
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:40,720
against are people like, that used to be, that's somebody's daughter. Yeah, guess what? So is every

47
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:47,520
stripper. Right about that, CNN. CNN does not do enough stripper-based programming. No, but they

48
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:52,240
do a fuck ton of Miley Cyrus-based programming. But the problem with your whole idea of it being

49
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:58,000
sexually provocative is that it like- It's not sexual at all? It literally, like, I have filed

50
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:04,160
1099s that have been more sexually arousing than that whole performance. Yeah, but in defense,

51
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:10,240
you file your 1099 by taking it to a strip club and tying two pins to a stripper's butt cheeks,

52
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:17,360
and then making him twerk on top of it. Twerk my taxes. You know, Justin never gets his taxes

53
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:22,320
done on time, and he doesn't write anything on the sheets. And it smells like buffet. It smells

54
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:27,840
like buffets. I try to get him on TurboTwerk because it's cheaper. It's ultimately cheaper.

55
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:32,560
This is My Brother, My Brother Me. It's an advice show for the modern era where we take your

56
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:38,160
questions and turn them alchemy-like into wisdom. Stop being a fucking pervert. That's point number

57
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:43,120
one. Guess what? One day, Miley Cyrus is going to die, probably of old age if she gets there.

58
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:48,720
You're not going to write, you remember when this old broad died. That wouldn't have happened if

59
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:53,200
she was 12 years old. Yeah, no shit. People get older. Time passes. We're all traveling through

60
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:57,440
fucking time. Where does Hannah Montana get off dying of old age? Do you guys think everyone

61
00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:03,200
else is just as surprised as we are when Robin Thicke shows up at performances now? As surprised

62
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:08,480
as Robin Thicke is, maybe. In his head, the entire time, he can't stop thinking,

63
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:14,560
I'm Alan Thicke's son. What am I even doing here? What am I doing here? It's only a matter of time

64
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:19,360
before they see through the charade. I'm dressed like Beetlejuice. They have to see through this.

65
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:22,480
They have to know what's up. They have to know I'm Alan Thicke's son. That's the dude from

66
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:27,520
Not Quite Human. He's going to go around the bend, and Alan Thicke is going to be more edgy than

67
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:32,080
Robin Thicke. He's got to be careful, because he's going to come out with some real role.

68
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:42,560
Show me that frown again. That's his edgy song. Instead of wanting to see your smile,

69
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:48,320
he wants to see your frown. I will soon be moving back to college for the second time at the age of

70
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:54,640
27. I will most likely be older than most of my classmates and flatmates. English, please. I'm

71
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:58,720
moving to a new city, and that won't help anyone. Have you any advice on how to deal with the

72
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:04,320
situation in terms of making friends? Like with relationships, is there an age gap that makes

73
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:12,880
friendships a bit weird? And that's from New to Newcastle. We're all taking a while to get to this

74
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:20,400
one, because we all know what we have to say. No, there's no age gap to relationships.

75
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:28,720
I had friends in college, at which point I was in my early 20s. I guess like 19 to 24,

76
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:34,880
I was in college. Yeah, five years. I'll back off. But I had friends that I did not realize until a

77
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:40,320
couple years into our friendship that they were in their late 20s or early 30s. It did not even

78
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:46,400
occur to me. I have friends like that now that I started working with the theater, and I knew some

79
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:50,240
of them for like two or three years, and then we had a birthday party for one of their 40th

80
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:58,080
birthdays. And I was like, oh shit, I thought you were like 28. But at the same time in your classes

81
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:05,360
as a freshman, when you look over and see somebody who's obviously nine years your senior, you get to

82
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:11,680
have some questions. I think that's a normal thing. What questions, though? You're going

83
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:17,200
to school. You're improving your life. It's not like the dude's 85 and going back to college.

84
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:23,840
I'm not saying it's a bad thing. I'm saying it's a mysterious thing. I was about to say,

85
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:31,200
then it's like a Rodney Dangerfield movie, when no, in fact, it is just a Rodney Dangerfield movie.

86
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:39,760
I don't think he was 27 when that movie was. Hard livin'. Hard livin'. That was after the point

87
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:44,400
when his face started to look like a fish's face, and I think that he hit that point.

88
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:51,760
His face slid down. By the time he was 70, Rodney Dangerfield's face is on his belly.

89
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:58,160
All people know that. Still hilarious. So funny. Funniest belly in the Catskills.

90
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:01,360
He looks like the alien from the Men in Black movie that we reference

91
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:05,360
in every episode of this podcast. I'm glad we're finally beating that

92
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:08,560
pretty boy Rodney Dangerfield up. That'll teach it.

93
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:13,840
Did you see him twerking at the VMAs? Who does he think he is?

94
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:17,680
Where does he get off? He's gotten too much respect for too long.

95
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:24,000
I think that when it comes to age and stuff in college, I think you are as old.

96
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:29,680
You know, you're as old as you act. You're as old as you feel. I think that if you go in there

97
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:34,720
being like, I'm out of place and I am too old and I don't fit in, that is exactly the vibe you're

98
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:37,440
going to give off, and people are going to be like, yeah, I don't know.

99
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:41,520
Yeah, I think that that's actually good. If you don't make a big thing of your age,

100
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:47,280
nobody's going to grill you on it. But when I moved back to Huntington after

101
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:53,200
college, I was like 23, 24, and I was hanging out with 19-year-olds, and it was no big deal.

102
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:57,280
That young stuff. I'm 32,

103
00:09:57,280 --> 00:10:03,600
and whenever I go to the high school football games and just talk to the people in band about

104
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:05,840
my glory days, I don't feel. You pull your van up

105
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:10,080
right underneath the bleachers. Probably just shout up until one of them looks down.

106
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:13,280
Yeah. Say, I got a stage pack if you guys want to share it.

107
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:14,880
You want to check the smell of light in your tuba?

108
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:19,680
They even made up a cute nickname for me. Him.

109
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:23,040
Oh, that's nice.

110
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:24,000
Or he's back.

111
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:28,320
They call me that sometimes. He's back. Him.

112
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:30,320
Griffin, how about a Yahoo?

113
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:35,200
Yeah, I would love that. I got a bunch of really, really good ones this week. Thank you guys all for

114
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:41,520
sending them in. If you want to send any Yahoo, just shoot it to mbmbam at maximumfun.org,

115
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:46,560
and I read every one. Thank you. This one was sent in by Ira Ray.

116
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:48,560
Are you Ira Ray?

117
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:49,200
Ira Ray.

118
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:52,560
Who wants to know? It's asked by Yahoo answer. She's a true beauty who asks,

119
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:57,600
how can I legally change my dog's name?

120
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:04,320
His name is Larry. I want to change it to Larry's Fiesta party on the house.

121
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:06,640
I'm sorry.

122
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:10,400
I'm going to open up a food truck inside my dog.

123
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:14,640
Or additional details or hot dog party days.

124
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:19,440
It's a really good name for a dog. Why do people keep sticking with one word name for dogs?

125
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:22,560
Well, this person doesn't say is that this is the dog's request.

126
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:26,960
Hey, Larry feels so unsophisticated, so unironic.

127
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:32,720
I don't know what channels you need to go through, but I've written down some suggestions.

128
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:36,320
It's why we don't teach dogs English because they ask for stupid things like this.

129
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:40,720
This is why I brought this question up is because it brings up a good point.

130
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:47,920
I'm learning all about sort of the life of dogs. We already discussed my revelation about dog

131
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:52,960
periods. Dogs go through a lot of the same shit that we go through, but at the same time, if I

132
00:11:53,600 --> 00:12:02,480
take my dog, Larry, his previous given name was Larry, and I decided to change it to Larry's

133
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:03,920
Fiesta party on the house.

134
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:05,760
The puppy formerly known as Larry.

135
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:14,240
Right. And I take LFPH to the vet and they're like, Larry? And I say, no, it's Larry's Fiesta

136
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:21,440
party on the house. They're not going to be like, says here on his documentation, it's Larry,

137
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:25,920
right? Or do I need to like go to the fucking courthouse, get a new social security card for

138
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:31,040
my goddamn dog? I thought it was just like my property. Like if I call my table Jerry,

139
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:35,680
then I can change it to Jerry's Fiesta party on the house, my table. I'm going to throw this out.

140
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:39,760
There actually is a circumstance in which you would have to go through some channels to change

141
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:45,600
your dog's name. What the fuck? If it is AKC registered, if it is registered with the American

142
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:50,800
Kennel Club as a purebred dog, then you have to register your dog. If it's a competition dog?

143
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:54,880
Is that what you're saying? No, if you breed it, our dog Nessie, Nessie was registered with the

144
00:12:54,880 --> 00:13:02,400
AKC as Nessie Bell Macaroy. We would have had to contact them to change her name. I changed my cat's

145
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:08,560
name. That's because you're a fucking dummy. I'm sorry. She looked like a- At the time she looked

146
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:13,680
like a Toby. That's my whole defense. Then it turned out when I got in there that- Her name

147
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:24,080
was Kunta Kinte. I asshole. I don't like this. She was a woman. She was a cat woman. She wasn't

148
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:29,760
a cat woman. She was a cat woman. This is my cat, cat woman. We have Toby on the books.

149
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:35,280
We have Toby on the books. We're going to need you to change your story. We're going to need to see

150
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:42,800
this cat's passport. What the fuck? This makes me angry. I think back to the pioneer days,

151
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:50,160
horses didn't have no documentation. You know what I mean? What about when all the dogs go to heaven,

152
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:53,520
don't you want St. Pete to have- What if he doesn't have them? Then they go to hell.

153
00:13:53,520 --> 00:13:57,040
I don't have a Larry Fiesta party on the house listed here.

154
00:13:57,040 --> 00:14:01,040
Can I break down actually Larry's Fiesta party on the house?

155
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:03,200
On the house is a parenthetical.

156
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:06,880
I mean, you could just do it. I mean, Fiesta party is obviously problematic.

157
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:11,760
Because we're really just saying Larry party party.

158
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:15,120
This is my dog Lawrence party party.

159
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:21,200
Larry's Fiesta party casual get together. The dog. The movie.

160
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:23,440
Did you see that movie?

161
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:26,960
Oh, Christ.

162
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:33,120
It asks or hot dog party days. I think Larry's Fiesta party is-

163
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:36,560
I think we're pretty- Is that in case the first name is already taken?

164
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:41,840
We actually already have Larry's Fiesta party.

165
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:45,440
We have a champion Basset hound named Larry's Fiesta party on the house.

166
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:50,640
This is fucking the fucking commentators at the Kennel Club show.

167
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:53,680
The annual Kennel Club show. Ladies and gentlemen,

168
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:57,200
I know this is going to get confusing, but here comes the second Larry's Fiesta party.

169
00:14:58,960 --> 00:15:00,480
Another purebred Basset hound.

170
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:06,880
It's a battle of the Larry's Fiesta party on the house.

171
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:09,360
Somehow we all knew it would come down to this.

172
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,360
A hush falls over the crowd.

173
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:16,080
And it all comes down to the heat of the genitals.

174
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:20,320
They both defecate at the same time. It is perfect.

175
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:25,360
We may have a multiverse situation. We may have a multiverse bleed.

176
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:27,920
It's made eye contact from across the room.

177
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:29,680
Travis, you know about dogs and shit.

178
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:34,400
Is a perfect defecation a category in the Westminster Kennel Club-

179
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:35,680
Only as a tiebreaker.

180
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:42,240
Make it look like the little iPhone picture of poopy.

181
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:44,240
Go.

182
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:45,280
Do you mean emoticon?

183
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:48,000
I actually have mean emojis.

184
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:48,720
Oh, that's right.

185
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:53,840
I forgot you finally learned that emojis is not teen slang for emotion,

186
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:55,600
which it still should be.

187
00:15:57,040 --> 00:16:02,080
I recently purchased a few suits for a new job I got that requires me to look somewhat formal.

188
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:04,720
I feel classy as hell wearing them.

189
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:06,480
I don't want to wear them as often as possible,

190
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:09,520
but my girlfriend keeps shooting me down saying I look silly.

191
00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:14,080
Aside from my job, when is classy but modern formal wear acceptable?

192
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:15,360
I'm a college student as well.

193
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:19,360
Would it be weird to wear a suit and tie to a college class

194
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:21,360
or when I'm just hanging out on campus?

195
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:23,280
That's from Suitless in Seattle.

196
00:16:23,280 --> 00:16:24,720
No, no, of course not.

197
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:26,480
No, Minkus, go right for it.

198
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:30,000
Can we go one episode with that?

199
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:33,680
You know, whenever I tell my significant other, Sidney,

200
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:36,800
to not wear something as formal,

201
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:40,000
it's usually because I don't want to-

202
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
Change out of your fat mama t-shirt?

203
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:45,760
Yeah, I don't want to match her game.

204
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:50,960
So maybe your girlfriend is just worried about having to step up her thing.

205
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:57,360
It is also possible that you and your friends are going to go ironically to Chuck E. Cheese,

206
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:59,600
and she does not want you to wear your suit there.

207
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:02,400
Well, I mean, that's a pretty extreme example.

208
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:04,400
I can think of like a hundred other ones,

209
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:08,000
a hundred other ones, including one that you mentioned in the email,

210
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,280
which is going to class.

211
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:13,120
No, unless you're in fucking forensics, no.

212
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:16,080
And even then, unless it's a debate day.

213
00:17:16,080 --> 00:17:17,200
And listen, here's the thing.

214
00:17:17,840 --> 00:17:21,440
You got to take a long, hard, cold look at yourself in the mirror.

215
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:23,760
Turn the AC way, way, way down.

216
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:25,440
Are you rocking that suit?

217
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:28,560
Everybody thinks they rock their own suits, right?

218
00:17:28,560 --> 00:17:29,200
Yep.

219
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:30,080
But are you?

220
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:33,760
Everybody says, you know, you look really good in a suit.

221
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:34,720
Well, yeah, they're suits.

222
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:35,520
Yeah, they're suits.

223
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:36,400
That's what they're there for.

224
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:37,440
That's what they're there for.

225
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:38,880
They hide all the bad things.

226
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:40,000
They hide all the secrets.

227
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:40,720
But here's the thing.

228
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:44,640
If you wear the same thing every day, if you wear a suit every day, it will wear off.

229
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:45,760
Sure.

230
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:48,880
Like, I look really good in my plate mail armor that I own.

231
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:49,760
Yeah.

232
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:54,000
It's because it hides all of my secret dumps and bumps.

233
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:58,960
See, you got to be careful because you can fall into like a Jesse Thorne scenario.

234
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:02,000
And the situation I feel like he set up for himself is that

235
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,880
he would wear a suit for a day-to-day function.

236
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:09,280
And then if I see him at something more formal where I'm wearing a suit,

237
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:14,160
I expect him to be in a tuxedo with a monocle riding a horse.

238
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:16,880
In full-blown, like, military dress.

239
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:21,280
If I am in full-blown military dress, I expect to see him in a diving bell.

240
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:23,520
Wait, what?

241
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:24,400
Why is he in that?

242
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:26,480
The next step up.

243
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:29,120
It's the most formal thing you can be in.

244
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:30,640
I mean, this is a diving bell.

245
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:34,720
I expect him to show up in like one of those suits that they wear in Tron.

246
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:38,000
And he's like, this is what's above it.

247
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,600
You didn't know because you've never been,

248
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:41,440
you've never seen anything like this before.

249
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:43,360
But this Tron is above military dress.

250
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:45,680
Well, the invitation said Tron formal.

251
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:46,240
Yeah.

252
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:52,720
That's actually pronounced semi.

253
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:53,920
And I think you're illiterate.

254
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:56,240
It's my other worry.

255
00:18:57,040 --> 00:18:59,360
The flip side of that coin, though,

256
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:01,520
is that I think if I have a picnic

257
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:03,840
and Jesse Thorne comes to it wearing cargo shorts,

258
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:05,520
then the entire park will burn down.

259
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:06,480
Right.

260
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:08,480
The universe can't handle that.

261
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:11,360
If you become suit guy, that's fine.

262
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:16,480
You know, we have a dude who was on ICOE with me.

263
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:19,760
He is, like, every day a dress shirt and tie dude.

264
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:20,320
You know what I mean?

265
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:22,080
And he rocks it and he wears it.

266
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:24,000
But there's a huge, there's a huge,

267
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:28,880
a gargantuan difference between just shirt and tie and suit.

268
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:30,560
And he can also rock a vest.

269
00:19:30,560 --> 00:19:31,440
Important to note.

270
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:33,680
You're stepping, I mean, he's stepping closer to the line there.

271
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:36,640
But every so often, like, one day a month,

272
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:38,880
like, he'll roll up in, like, T-shirt and jeans

273
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:41,200
and, like, everybody comments.

274
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:43,040
Everybody's like, oh, just T-shirt and jeans today?

275
00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:43,520
What's up?

276
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:47,680
And it's like, he's like, no, just wore T-shirt and jeans.

277
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:48,800
But I feel like it's the same

278
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:50,560
as if you wear T-shirt and jeans every day

279
00:19:50,560 --> 00:19:52,640
and then just roll up to class in, like, a suit.

280
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:54,800
It's like if you're Hannah Montana for 20 years

281
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:55,760
and then you torque.

282
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:56,800
It's the same, exactly.

283
00:19:56,800 --> 00:19:59,040
Wow, but you're, but, you know, I even know.

284
00:19:59,040 --> 00:20:01,120
Sometimes Dubin comes into the office twerking.

285
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:02,080
I was like, hey, why are you twerking today?

286
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:06,240
I even draw a clearer delineation between school and work.

287
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:07,920
I feel like no matter what your job is,

288
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:11,680
if you wear, I mean, with most circumstances,

289
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:14,640
if you wear a suit, it's pretty much just like a power play

290
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:17,200
that says, I'm in a suit.

291
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:18,240
Why aren't you in a suit?

292
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:21,680
This is what we, this is what adults wear to work.

293
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:22,880
Why don't you wear it?

294
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:27,920
Well, because Arby's makes you wear a very specific uniform.

295
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:30,960
Yeah, but if you wear a suit to Arby's,

296
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:32,560
you're manager by the end of the week.

297
00:20:32,560 --> 00:20:33,280
Oh yeah.

298
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:33,600
Period.

299
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:35,680
I don't think that's how that, I don't think I,

300
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:36,000
if I go to-

301
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,680
Period the end, I said.

302
00:20:37,680 --> 00:20:41,280
If I go to Arby's and the cashier is wearing a full-blown suit,

303
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:43,440
I'm gonna be like, thank you for the roast beef,

304
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:44,480
but do you work here?

305
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:46,560
Let me throw this out.

306
00:20:46,560 --> 00:20:49,040
Went to Home Depot, the cashier checked me out,

307
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:51,520
was wearing cargo shorts and a polo shirt,

308
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:55,280
and wait for it, a tie with his polo shirt.

309
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:56,640
I am into this look.

310
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:58,240
And a cabby hat.

311
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:00,320
Oh my God.

312
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:01,520
Wait, what's a cabby hat?

313
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:03,200
A cabby hat, like a newsboy hat.

314
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:04,000
And a flat cap.

315
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:08,640
And then like some like bug-eye shaped glasses

316
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:10,560
that were purely for decoration.

317
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:13,360
Okay, was it fucking Puck from the real world?

318
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:16,000
Did he wait on you at the Home Depot?

319
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:20,000
I am 19 years old, and I'm a long time listener of the show.

320
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:23,520
I enjoy smoking a pipe or cigar from time to time,

321
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:27,520
but many of my friends think it's odd for someone my age.

322
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:30,320
Even some clerks of the stores I purchase these products from

323
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:32,160
act like it's weird for me to buy them.

324
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:35,280
Is it strange that I enjoy these things?

325
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:36,640
That's from Junius V.

326
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:39,680
I don't think anyone actually enjoys a cigar.

327
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:43,840
Yeah, I mean, I sure don't.

328
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:46,400
I think a cigar is like a commitment that you make.

329
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:47,600
Don't make, Travis, please.

330
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:49,200
We've been on the internet for three years.

331
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:51,840
Have you not learned that if you make a blanket statement

332
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:53,200
on that, you're basically saying,

333
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:56,240
hey, email me about your cigar life.

334
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:58,960
Well, I don't think, like, what's the most expensive cigar

335
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:00,800
that anyone on this podcast has smoked?

336
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:05,040
Because I guarantee my like finest experience

337
00:22:05,040 --> 00:22:08,000
costs maybe like $3 at a gas station.

338
00:22:09,040 --> 00:22:11,600
I've had me a $20 cigar.

339
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:13,840
I've had me a $20 cigar.

340
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:14,880
Wow.

341
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:16,640
Yeah, it was at a wedding.

342
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:20,240
And it tasted exactly like a $1 cigar.

343
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:24,160
I think it's probably like whiskey or brandy, right?

344
00:22:24,160 --> 00:22:26,000
Like you can't really appreciate.

345
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,640
Maybe, but a cigar is just such a commitment

346
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:30,800
or like this is what I'm doing for the next three hours

347
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:33,200
or I'm gonna like stub it out or cut it off

348
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:35,120
or do lots of weird shit.

349
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:36,880
When someone hands you a cigar and they're like,

350
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:40,080
smoke with me for the next three hours,

351
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:42,400
it'll be stinkier than a billion cigarettes.

352
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:45,120
Your mouth will taste like you ate

353
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:46,640
a bunch of wet cigarette butt.

354
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:47,680
That is a good point.

355
00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:50,240
If someone asks you to go smoke a cigar with them,

356
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:53,360
they might as well be asking me to go on vacation.

357
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:55,600
Like it's the same, I see it as the same,

358
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:57,360
oh, we're gonna talk for three hours?

359
00:22:57,360 --> 00:22:58,880
Sounds good, sounds good.

360
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:02,320
If I were on a yacht and that was like all I was doing

361
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:04,880
for three hours, yes, I would probably have a cigar,

362
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:06,720
but not like middle of a nice party

363
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:07,920
where I'm hanging out with friends

364
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:10,240
and somebody like, hey, do you wanna ignore everyone

365
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:12,160
for like two and a half, three hours?

366
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:14,160
Hey, you're never gonna wear that shirt again, right?

367
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:20,640
Okay, so to actually answer your question

368
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:23,040
rather than us just passing judgment on cigar smokers,

369
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:26,080
a pipe is similar.

370
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:28,720
A pipe could take you 30 minutes to an hour

371
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:29,920
to smoke through a whole.

372
00:23:29,920 --> 00:23:31,760
Pipe don't stink like shit though.

373
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:32,640
Yeah, everybody loves a pipe.

374
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:35,680
Okay, but let's not, I really, I don't care about this

375
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:38,720
but I really, really don't wanna get emails about cigars.

376
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:39,680
Like I really don't.

377
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:42,160
You don't even read the emails, I'll deal with it.

378
00:23:43,040 --> 00:23:44,480
I'll take this heat.

379
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:46,720
The only way I have of educating myself

380
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:49,920
about anything anymore is by saying mean shit

381
00:23:49,920 --> 00:23:52,160
about it on the internet and then I get very mean

382
00:23:52,160 --> 00:23:54,000
but very educational emails on the matter.

383
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,040
That's how I learned about furries,

384
00:23:55,040 --> 00:23:56,240
that's how I learned about farmers.

385
00:23:57,760 --> 00:23:58,880
That's how I learned about jugglers.

386
00:24:01,040 --> 00:24:03,280
I like, I used to like a pipe.

387
00:24:03,280 --> 00:24:06,960
It's hard for me to wholeheartedly recommend

388
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:09,440
any of this stuff now because there's kids.

389
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:10,480
I mean, I can't do it.

390
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:12,400
But here, I can tell you right now,

391
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:15,040
I can pinpoint why it seems weird

392
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:18,160
and I don't think it's because you're 19.

393
00:24:18,160 --> 00:24:20,320
I think it's because both of those things,

394
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:22,320
a pipe and a cigar are so indicative

395
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:25,200
of like a leisurely lifestyle of like,

396
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:28,640
I'm a man who sits in my lounge and smokes a pipe

397
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:30,560
while I read a thick book.

398
00:24:30,560 --> 00:24:33,680
Okay, so Travis, you're saying that a pipe

399
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:37,040
or a cigar is like a victory lap for life.

400
00:24:37,040 --> 00:24:37,600
I am.

401
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:39,440
And if you're younger, it's like,

402
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:41,120
why aren't you out there on the hustle?

403
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:42,400
Why aren't you on your game?

404
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:45,840
I think it's just like we see a kid smoking a pipe

405
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:47,280
and we're like, you haven't earned that.

406
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:48,080
Yeah.

407
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:49,920
You don't get to just do that.

408
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:51,920
Well, I think a part of that,

409
00:24:51,920 --> 00:24:53,360
and I'm not saying that this is the case

410
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:55,440
for our dear beloved listener,

411
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:59,360
but I think that these two things fall into the long list

412
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:03,520
of things that like super grown ass adults do

413
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:07,360
that in college kind of plays like an affectation.

414
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:08,800
And I'm not saying that that's the case,

415
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:11,600
but I like, I don't know, for 19,

416
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:14,160
I didn't know any 19 year olds that smoke cigars and pipes,

417
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:18,480
but I did know a lot of 22 year olds who did it.

418
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:19,680
But if you were like the kid

419
00:25:19,680 --> 00:25:22,400
who only drinks fine brandy at parties,

420
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:25,760
it's like, yeah, at 19, that's incredibly douchey

421
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:28,320
and at like 59, it's incredibly classy

422
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:30,240
without with very little difference.

423
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:31,440
You gotta earn that shit.

424
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:32,480
You gotta have some kids.

425
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:34,160
You gotta lose some wives.

426
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:34,720
You know what I mean?

427
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:39,200
You gotta see like the nitty gritty shit of the world.

428
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:39,840
You know what I mean?

429
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:42,640
You gotta be crushed down and build yourself back up

430
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:44,480
or just stop doing it in front of people.

431
00:25:45,280 --> 00:25:46,800
Just keep it like a secret.

432
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:48,640
Yeah, that is a thing.

433
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:50,960
Also, I think with pipes and cigars is that

434
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:53,440
it's such a production that if you're doing it around people,

435
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:56,800
you're really saying like, hey, check this out.

436
00:25:56,800 --> 00:25:58,480
Check this out, especially a pipe.

437
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:00,800
Oh God, it's like you're making a Subway sandwich

438
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:05,600
because you gotta get the pipe out.

439
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:07,120
You gotta clean it with a pipe cleaner

440
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:08,560
that you keep in a separate bag

441
00:26:08,560 --> 00:26:09,920
and then you gotta get your tobacco out

442
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:11,040
and then you gotta make everyone smell

443
00:26:11,040 --> 00:26:12,480
like it smells so good.

444
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:14,480
And then you gotta stuff it in with the ramrod

445
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:16,400
and then you gotta light it, which takes forever.

446
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:21,360
And then you gotta drizzle mustard on top of the tobacco.

447
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:24,000
When I used to smoke a pipe, I did know,

448
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,320
I felt like it was an affectation,

449
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:28,880
but the thing about it is,

450
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:30,800
if you do an affectation for long enough,

451
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:32,080
it's just your thing.

452
00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:35,840
You have to do it until someone else tries to do it

453
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:37,440
and then it's their affectation.

454
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:40,400
Like, they're the low man on the smoking totem pole.

455
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:42,960
And listen, smoking a pipe is awesome.

456
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:43,520
Yeah, it's great.

457
00:26:44,560 --> 00:26:47,200
Don't get one of those fucking Lord of the Rings

458
00:26:47,920 --> 00:26:49,440
long ass Tolkien pipes.

459
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:51,280
Don't do a Sherlock either.

460
00:26:51,280 --> 00:26:53,280
Don't do a Sherlock, just get a basic ass-

461
00:26:53,280 --> 00:26:54,320
How long did I do a Sherlock?

462
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:56,080
Griffin got me this beautiful pear wood pipe

463
00:26:56,080 --> 00:26:57,920
that I still enjoy from time to time.

464
00:26:57,920 --> 00:26:59,360
That was for display only.

465
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:00,240
You're smoking that?

466
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:01,840
Oh God.

467
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:03,120
That was soaked in resin.

468
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:05,280
Bong resin.

469
00:27:05,280 --> 00:27:07,120
I used it as a bong for four years.

470
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:08,000
Bong resin.

471
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:10,320
Oh, just smoke a bong.

472
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:11,840
Just smoke a bunch of weed.

473
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:13,040
What are you doing?

474
00:27:13,040 --> 00:27:14,560
That's why all the adults judge you

475
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:15,360
because they're sitting there going,

476
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:16,400
do you know why I smoke this pipe?

477
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:17,840
Because I can't smoke weed anymore.

478
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:18,800
What are you doing?

479
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:19,680
Actually, you know what?

480
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:21,200
That's a great point.

481
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:23,920
When you're an adult, you'll be able to buy cigars.

482
00:27:23,920 --> 00:27:26,880
Once you get to be my age,

483
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:28,960
you don't know where weed is anymore.

484
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:31,040
When you are handed the diploma by the dean,

485
00:27:31,040 --> 00:27:33,120
the dean says hand over all your doobers.

486
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:35,120
Hand over your final doobers.

487
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:36,720
Should have smoked these last night, chief.

488
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:40,880
Oh, you fucked up bad.

489
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:42,400
Nobody's ever been to a party-

490
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:44,800
Enjoy your shitty cigars that do nothing for you

491
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:46,560
except give you dry mouth the next day.

492
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:47,680
When you're at a party

493
00:27:47,680 --> 00:27:50,240
and you stand next to somebody smoking a cigar,

494
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:53,360
you think, oh man, they're going to be doing that for a while.

495
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:54,080
We better move.

496
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:55,760
And if you see them smoking weed, you think,

497
00:27:55,760 --> 00:27:58,960
oh man, it would be cool if you offered that.

498
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:02,240
If you said, hey-

499
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:04,000
If you pass that on the left-hand side.

500
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:08,080
I wish that that man was standing closer to me

501
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:10,640
so I might absorb some of his magic.

502
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:24,160
Hey Travis, who's this message for?

503
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:25,280
It's for Lance Taylor.

504
00:28:25,920 --> 00:28:27,360
Hey Griffin, who's this message from?

505
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:31,280
It's from Brett, Shelby, Jordan, and Alyssa.

506
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:33,920
Hey Justin, what is the message?

507
00:28:35,040 --> 00:28:37,520
Wishing our cousin Lance a belated happy birthday.

508
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:40,000
He never ceases to live like he's dying,

509
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,160
which is a mentality that's easy to achieve

510
00:28:42,160 --> 00:28:44,880
once you turn 30, then new 40.

511
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:47,120
Also with introducing us and others to MBMBAM,

512
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:50,080
he enjoys video games, music, and hanging out with his family.

513
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:52,640
We love you and hope you are alive to celebrate next year.

514
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:53,840
That's grim.

515
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:54,400
That's a little grim.

516
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:55,840
The first time I read through it,

517
00:28:55,840 --> 00:28:58,640
I thought it said he never ceases to be dying.

518
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:00,800
Yeah, well, but that's true too, right?

519
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:01,920
It's very depressing for a moment.

520
00:29:01,920 --> 00:29:03,040
It's very true though, right?

521
00:29:03,040 --> 00:29:04,080
It's true though.

522
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:07,520
Here's a haunting reminder of your ephemeral existence.

523
00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:09,680
I like upscaling that 30 to 40 thing

524
00:29:09,680 --> 00:29:11,360
because since I turned 26,

525
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:13,840
I'm pretty convinced that 26 is the new 75.

526
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:17,360
It's strange though because it's not a sliding scale

527
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:21,920
because 27 is the new 82, but then 28 is the new 46.

528
00:29:21,920 --> 00:29:23,600
Yeah, you get downgraded.

529
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:26,640
But yeah, oh God, guys, I'm falling apart.

530
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:29,680
I think I have just entire bones missing.

531
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:32,800
I think I'm just missing entire bones.

532
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:35,120
The tooth fairy actually gets greedy as you get older.

533
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:36,160
She comes for your bones.

534
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:39,200
She leaves your teeth though, which is nice.

535
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:41,600
Hey, do you like TV, you guys?

536
00:29:42,160 --> 00:29:42,640
I guess.

537
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:44,640
I mean, I like watching.

538
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:47,120
That's a medium, you know?

539
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:48,080
I like shows.

540
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:53,520
We have been paid to tell you about a product

541
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:57,680
that we're pretty sure everybody in the world already has.

542
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:01,280
Hulu Plus, of course, you know,

543
00:30:01,280 --> 00:30:04,080
it lets you watch thousands of hit shows wherever you want.

544
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:05,360
You can stream it on your TV

545
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:07,920
or like your smartphone or your tablet

546
00:30:07,920 --> 00:30:09,360
and you can binge watch shows.

547
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:10,320
Or all three at the same time.

548
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:10,800
All three.

549
00:30:10,800 --> 00:30:14,160
If you need constant entertainment like I do.

550
00:30:14,160 --> 00:30:16,160
Talks about binge watching your favorite shows

551
00:30:16,160 --> 00:30:19,040
like SNL, Community, Modern Family, shows like that.

552
00:30:19,040 --> 00:30:21,120
Like you could get through a whole season

553
00:30:21,680 --> 00:30:23,680
of Community in like an hour

554
00:30:23,680 --> 00:30:25,680
if you just stream them from four devices

555
00:30:25,680 --> 00:30:26,480
that you simultaneously.

556
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:29,360
Yeah, surround yourself like in Swordfish.

557
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:31,920
Oh, just watch, do they have Swordfish on Hulu Plus?

558
00:30:31,920 --> 00:30:32,400
Probably.

559
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:33,120
Can you get Swordfish?

560
00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:34,800
I'm almost certain they have Cabin Boy,

561
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:36,640
but I don't think it's the same thing.

562
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:42,320
It's only $79 a day.

563
00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:43,680
What are you doing?

564
00:30:43,680 --> 00:30:46,000
It is $7.99 a month.

565
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,240
$7.99 for all the shows and movies you can watch.

566
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:50,720
It's super cheap for infinite television.

567
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:53,280
You can binge on old classics.

568
00:30:53,280 --> 00:30:54,080
You can watch movies.

569
00:30:54,080 --> 00:30:54,800
They got movies.

570
00:30:55,840 --> 00:30:57,520
It's great, but like they came to us

571
00:30:57,520 --> 00:31:00,000
and they're like, here's three free codes to do Hulu Plus.

572
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:03,520
And it's like, thanks, but we all literally already have it

573
00:31:03,520 --> 00:31:04,800
because everybody has Hulu.

574
00:31:04,800 --> 00:31:06,720
They're like, here's three social security cards.

575
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:07,520
Like we have those.

576
00:31:08,160 --> 00:31:08,960
We don't need those.

577
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:11,520
But on the off chance that you don't,

578
00:31:11,520 --> 00:31:14,480
go to HuluPlus.com slash my brother

579
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:19,040
and prove that this is apparently a thing

580
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:19,840
that people don't have.

581
00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:21,520
And you can get two free weeks

582
00:31:21,520 --> 00:31:25,360
by going to HuluPlus.com slash my brother.

583
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:26,560
And yeah, and if you don't use it,

584
00:31:26,560 --> 00:31:28,560
it's great because Hulu Plus is awesome.

585
00:31:28,560 --> 00:31:30,880
And it also makes us look like super cool dudes.

586
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:33,360
Who deserve more Hulu money,

587
00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:35,360
even though everybody already has it.

588
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:38,320
Let him keep flushing this money down the toilet.

589
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:40,000
Down the toilet of our wallet.

590
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,720
Hey, hey, have you been looking to integrate

591
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:46,320
the toilet into your lovemaking?

592
00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:48,640
Boy, if I got a place for you to go,

593
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:50,400
it's called extremistraints.com.

594
00:31:51,680 --> 00:31:53,760
Tell me more about this website, Justin.

595
00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:55,360
Again, it's like Hulu fucking Plus.

596
00:31:55,360 --> 00:31:58,000
It's like, doesn't everybody already have every dildo?

597
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,000
Every, every faux gaper.

598
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,680
Don't they have all that shit already?

599
00:32:01,680 --> 00:32:05,120
Don't they already have all the sex furniture?

600
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:06,960
They could, let me tell you about the door.

601
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:10,960
Oh man, the doggy style locking spreader is great

602
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:14,160
because sometimes when I'm about to get my butthole blasted,

603
00:32:14,160 --> 00:32:17,120
I'll flake out late in the game.

604
00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:19,280
Like, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

605
00:32:19,280 --> 00:32:21,920
Or you have to sneeze and it's like, oh no.

606
00:32:22,800 --> 00:32:26,960
Great, now my kidney's on the ground.

607
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:29,920
But the great thing about the doggy style spreading locker

608
00:32:29,920 --> 00:32:33,360
is for, or sorry, the doggy style locking spreader,

609
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:36,000
it's just $188.

610
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,640
There's probably one of those too, a spreading locker.

611
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:43,600
For just $188, you can buy one of these

612
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:46,240
and you can cuff your hands and your ankles together

613
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:48,960
and let someone just go to town.

614
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:52,560
Yeah, we'll see if this multimedia

615
00:32:52,560 --> 00:32:54,160
that I'm trying to incorporate in the show works.

616
00:32:54,160 --> 00:32:56,400
But I just texted both of you a picture

617
00:32:56,400 --> 00:32:59,520
that I took of a vending machine in a German bathroom.

618
00:32:59,520 --> 00:33:01,680
And let's just wait until it gets there

619
00:33:01,680 --> 00:33:05,200
and then we can fold it into the experience of the show.

620
00:33:07,520 --> 00:33:08,240
Oh, there we go.

621
00:33:11,920 --> 00:33:16,320
This is a product that is sold in this German vending machine.

622
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:18,160
I did not purchase it because it was three euro

623
00:33:18,160 --> 00:33:19,200
and I had already exchanged.

624
00:33:20,160 --> 00:33:21,920
It's a product called Travel Pussy.

625
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:27,840
Is that people who need a neck pillow all the time

626
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:29,520
anytime they're on a flight?

627
00:33:29,520 --> 00:33:30,960
I think the Travel Pussy, yeah,

628
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:33,760
it's someone who's actually afraid of going through security.

629
00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:35,440
Hold my hand, we're taking off.

630
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:37,680
Oh, just, oh, come on.

631
00:33:37,680 --> 00:33:39,280
What is Travel Pussy?

632
00:33:39,280 --> 00:33:41,760
This is, I did not buy this product,

633
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:43,760
but people I know did.

634
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:48,400
This sounds like somebody, a friend of mine.

635
00:33:48,400 --> 00:33:50,160
I didn't, but a friend, no.

636
00:33:50,160 --> 00:33:52,320
It's a guy named Miffin Grackleroy.

637
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:56,800
Apparently it's just a, and I don't wanna get coarse

638
00:33:56,800 --> 00:33:57,920
and I don't wanna get blue,

639
00:33:57,920 --> 00:33:59,360
because it's not that kind of show,

640
00:33:59,360 --> 00:34:04,320
but apparently it's just a plastic bag with some lube.

641
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:08,640
And if that's like true love waits,

642
00:34:08,640 --> 00:34:12,320
and like obviously I believe in that and I'm waiting,

643
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:16,080
but if it's just a wet garbage bag,

644
00:34:16,080 --> 00:34:18,640
like I'm just gonna go hang myself.

645
00:34:18,640 --> 00:34:20,320
Like if that's what I've been waiting for

646
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:23,200
and that's what I've been looking forward to, I'm dead.

647
00:34:23,200 --> 00:34:25,680
Griffin, important, important question.

648
00:34:25,680 --> 00:34:28,400
What else was in the vending machine?

649
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:31,520
Oh, I mean, I can text you another pick.

650
00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:34,640
Well, because if you could get a Travel Pussy LMRs bar,

651
00:34:34,640 --> 00:34:36,480
I'm gonna be really excited.

652
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:39,360
This is gonna cover me for the whole trip.

653
00:34:39,360 --> 00:34:40,480
But you don't want this,

654
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:41,920
you don't want that kind of low grade shit.

655
00:34:41,920 --> 00:34:44,320
You want the good stuff on ExtremeRestraints.com.

656
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:46,960
Stuff that'll bend your penis into the shape of a snake

657
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:49,200
for $50, but not $50 because that's the price.

658
00:34:49,200 --> 00:34:52,480
To be fair, most penises are already in the shape of a snake.

659
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:55,520
Like a cobra about to strike them.

660
00:34:55,520 --> 00:34:57,520

669
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:18,800
Hi everybody, I'm Justin McElroy.

670
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:20,320
I'm Dr. Sydney McElroy.

671
00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:23,040
You told me to say it that way.

672
00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:26,400
We have a medical history show called Sawbones right here on Maximum Fun

673
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:29,760
where we talk about all the dumb, hurtful,

674
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:32,720
damaging ways that we've tried to fix people over the years.

675
00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:35,840
Have you ever tried to put mercury on a syphilis shanker?

676
00:35:35,840 --> 00:35:38,000
Or maybe you tried to drill a hole in your head

677
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:39,920
because you heard it would reduce your blood-brain volume?

678
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:41,520
That was dumb.

679
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:43,600
But if you want to know exactly why

680
00:35:43,600 --> 00:35:46,720
and know about all the other people that try to do the same dumb thing you did,

681
00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:53,920
you can listen to our show every Friday right here on MaximumFun.org.

682
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:55,120
Let's move on.

683
00:35:55,120 --> 00:35:56,240
Griffin, how about another Yahi?

684
00:35:56,240 --> 00:35:57,120
You got one of those lying around?

685
00:35:57,120 --> 00:35:57,840
You're not going to do Farm Wisdom?

686
00:36:00,080 --> 00:36:01,360
Farm Wisdom!

687
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:03,120
Farm Wisdom.

688
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:06,240
Call your Uncle Jake Farm Wisdom.

689
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:06,880
That one.

690
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:08,000
It's not my best.

691
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:08,800
It's not his name.

692
00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:10,480
What?

693
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:11,280
What are you talking about?

694
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:12,880
Our uncles, we don't have an Uncle Jake.

695
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:15,600
I was going to rhyme it with something

696
00:36:15,600 --> 00:36:16,800
I ran out of syllables.

697
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:19,600
I thought you said Uncle Drake, like the performer.

698
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:22,560
My Uncle Drake?

699
00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:24,240
He played Jimmy on Degrassi?

700
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:27,840
Why don't you read it, Travis?

701
00:36:27,840 --> 00:36:32,480
To trap slugs, bury a dish to ground level and fill with beer.

702
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:35,520
Slugs crawl in and drown in beer.

703
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:37,760
Also, apparently slugs prefer dark beer.

704
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:39,040
And that is from Laura.

705
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:41,520
And she says, PS, I am an actual farmer.

706
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:43,360
That's handy.

707
00:36:43,360 --> 00:36:46,400
But you're also going to get a lot of high schoolers.

708
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:48,960
Just drink up.

709
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:50,720
Another one drowning here, Margaret.

710
00:36:50,720 --> 00:36:52,720
Boy, you know how desperate you have to be

711
00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:54,720
to impress your friends to say,

712
00:36:54,720 --> 00:36:57,040
I know there's a farm we can drive out to

713
00:36:57,040 --> 00:36:59,520
where we can squirt some brew

714
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:02,960
that may have the occasional 80 slugs in it.

715
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:04,080
How much you ask?

716
00:37:04,080 --> 00:37:05,360
About half a bowl's worth.

717
00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:08,640
Depends on how much the slugs get.

718
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:11,840
Who wants to kick back a bowl of suds and slugs?

719
00:37:11,840 --> 00:37:13,040
Slugs and slugs.

720
00:37:13,040 --> 00:37:13,540
What?

721
00:37:15,680 --> 00:37:16,560
Suds and slugs.

722
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:18,320
I said I knew where beer was.

723
00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:20,000
That's what I said.

724
00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:23,680
Really, it's your fault for not asking any follow up questions.

725
00:37:23,680 --> 00:37:24,160
Right.

726
00:37:24,160 --> 00:37:27,280
You should, when I said, hey, I know where beer is,

727
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:30,080
you should have said, hey, Jeff, quick follow up.

728
00:37:30,080 --> 00:37:30,880
Is there slugs?

729
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:34,080
Is there slugs, too?

730
00:37:34,080 --> 00:37:36,640
You could be the worst cool older brother ever.

731
00:37:38,240 --> 00:37:41,120
Mark that on this map and I'll sell it to you for $15.

732
00:37:41,120 --> 00:37:41,600
No problem.

733
00:37:41,600 --> 00:37:43,040
I could screw you guys some brew.

734
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:44,880
Well, I'm where the map told me to be.

735
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:48,560
But all I see is sort of brown drunk slugs.

736
00:37:49,360 --> 00:37:51,680
Oh, you didn't tell me your position on slugs.

737
00:37:52,240 --> 00:37:53,120
Wasn't aware.

738
00:37:53,120 --> 00:37:54,080
Wasn't aware, Steve.

739
00:37:54,080 --> 00:37:54,640
Sorry, guys.

740
00:37:54,640 --> 00:37:55,840
You're squeamish.

741
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:57,360
Got a date with a prom queen.

742
00:37:57,920 --> 00:37:59,360
Gotta go, your older brother.

743
00:38:01,600 --> 00:38:04,720
This next one is applicable because I do have an ant problem.

744
00:38:04,720 --> 00:38:06,480
If ants start invading your home,

745
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:10,000
lay down or sprinkle cinnamon wherever you think the ants are coming from.

746
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:11,200
Ants hate cinnamon.

747
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:14,160
It's environmentally safe, so it also works in gardens.

748
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:17,280
That's from our buddy, Asumen Mariko.

749
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:19,200
I want to say I'm really glad that he gave us the option

750
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:21,760
so we can either sprinkle it or just lay it down.

751
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:25,360
Get cozy.

752
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:26,880
I'll put you right here.

753
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:28,080
You're gonna be okay.

754
00:38:28,080 --> 00:38:28,880
Hey, Simminen.

755
00:38:29,680 --> 00:38:30,400
Hey, Simminen.

756
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:32,720
Hey, Simminen, baby.

757
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:36,240
Just lay down.

758
00:38:37,120 --> 00:38:37,920
Do you guys want Yahoo?

759
00:38:38,560 --> 00:38:39,060
Yeah.

760
00:38:39,060 --> 00:38:40,180
Yahoo.

761
00:38:40,180 --> 00:38:44,180
This Yahoo was sent in by Richard Chachere or Chachere.

762
00:38:45,060 --> 00:38:45,460
Thank you.

763
00:38:45,460 --> 00:38:46,900
Are you Richard Chachere?

764
00:38:48,340 --> 00:38:49,460
He is.

765
00:38:49,460 --> 00:38:49,780
Yes.

766
00:38:49,780 --> 00:38:51,380
Yes, I am.

767
00:38:51,380 --> 00:38:52,420
Did you need-

768
00:38:52,420 --> 00:38:53,220
No, okay.

769
00:38:53,220 --> 00:38:56,900
It's by Yahoo Answers user Jenny who asks,

770
00:38:58,660 --> 00:39:04,500
why is a big chest or doing it on a bed not called a fetish,

771
00:39:04,500 --> 00:39:07,300
but toilet time love is called a fetish?

772
00:39:07,300 --> 00:39:07,800
Wow.

773
00:39:07,800 --> 00:39:08,300
Wow.

774
00:39:08,300 --> 00:39:08,800
Wow.

775
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:12,120
A lot of textbook terms in there.

776
00:39:12,120 --> 00:39:15,720
What if everyone around me also likes toilet time love?

777
00:39:15,720 --> 00:39:18,440
On some websites, does that mean they're normal?

778
00:39:18,440 --> 00:39:22,040
And people who need big chests or being kissed

779
00:39:22,040 --> 00:39:23,560
are like weird because they're different.

780
00:39:28,360 --> 00:39:31,320
Does she mean big chests like bosoms

781
00:39:31,320 --> 00:39:34,840
or like doing it inside of a large trunk?

782
00:39:34,840 --> 00:39:37,720
Get inside of this treasure chest.

783
00:39:37,720 --> 00:39:39,640
You are my treasure and I'm going to fuck you.

784
00:39:41,400 --> 00:39:42,200
Avast.

785
00:39:42,200 --> 00:39:42,760
Avast.

786
00:39:42,760 --> 00:39:43,640
Ahoy.

787
00:39:43,640 --> 00:39:44,140
Yarr.

788
00:39:44,680 --> 00:39:46,760
I hate when a Yahoo Answer question is like a good-

789
00:39:47,960 --> 00:39:49,400
It's a good fucking, right?

790
00:39:49,400 --> 00:39:50,920
It's a good fucking point, Yahoo Answers.

791
00:39:50,920 --> 00:39:53,800
How come everybody kisses and that's fine,

792
00:39:53,800 --> 00:39:55,800
but I want to have toilet time fun

793
00:39:55,800 --> 00:39:58,360
and whatever that may be, I'm not sure yet.

794
00:39:58,360 --> 00:40:00,120
Travis, it's not toilet time fun, okay?

795
00:40:00,120 --> 00:40:01,240
This is love.

796
00:40:01,240 --> 00:40:03,240
It's toilet time party fiesta in the house.

797
00:40:03,240 --> 00:40:06,600
Travis, do you make fun to your fiance?

798
00:40:08,040 --> 00:40:08,840
Pardon?

799
00:40:08,840 --> 00:40:09,320
Do you make-

800
00:40:09,320 --> 00:40:10,440
We listen to fun.

801
00:40:10,440 --> 00:40:12,360
Do you make fun to your fiance?

802
00:40:12,920 --> 00:40:13,800
Fun dip?

803
00:40:13,800 --> 00:40:14,440
What did you say?

804
00:40:16,040 --> 00:40:17,560
I make fun with her.

805
00:40:20,200 --> 00:40:21,960
I would call what we do making fun.

806
00:40:28,920 --> 00:40:30,040
What happened, folks?

807
00:40:30,040 --> 00:40:32,200
It took us 160 some episodes.

808
00:40:32,200 --> 00:40:34,760
The show is too weird for me to listen to.

809
00:40:34,760 --> 00:40:35,800
Good night, everybody.

810
00:40:36,520 --> 00:40:37,880
That's great, because in that statement,

811
00:40:37,880 --> 00:40:40,680
I think I alienated both my brothers and my fiance.

812
00:40:40,680 --> 00:40:41,400
Yeah, well done.

813
00:40:42,520 --> 00:40:43,960
Yeah, it's a record.

814
00:40:45,080 --> 00:40:45,560
I apologize.

815
00:40:45,560 --> 00:40:48,440
That question was the fucking Kobayashi Maru.

816
00:40:48,440 --> 00:40:49,240
I apologize.

817
00:40:49,240 --> 00:40:50,840
There's no winning there.

818
00:40:52,840 --> 00:40:58,360
I feel like a fetish is the equivalent of being into an indie band.

819
00:40:58,360 --> 00:41:00,600
Like, if everybody likes it,

820
00:41:00,600 --> 00:41:02,920
then it doesn't feel like a fetish anymore.

821
00:41:02,920 --> 00:41:05,160
It's just sort of a common thing.

822
00:41:06,680 --> 00:41:08,760
If fetish feels special to you, it's like,

823
00:41:08,760 --> 00:41:10,440
oh, this is my special thing.

824
00:41:10,440 --> 00:41:12,840
The thing, isn't it, that indie bands,

825
00:41:13,560 --> 00:41:16,040
the fucking Vampire Weekend was super indie,

826
00:41:16,040 --> 00:41:18,680
and then they got a Grammy, didn't they?

827
00:41:20,200 --> 00:41:22,040
Arcade Fire used to be indiest of the indie,

828
00:41:22,040 --> 00:41:23,000
and then they got a Grammy.

829
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:24,040
What I'm saying is that-

830
00:41:24,040 --> 00:41:25,480
Anal Sex used to be a fetish,

831
00:41:25,480 --> 00:41:26,920
and then it was on the VMAs.

832
00:41:26,920 --> 00:41:28,520
And then it was on the VMAs.

833
00:41:28,520 --> 00:41:32,040
But are we, in like a few years,

834
00:41:32,040 --> 00:41:33,880
just gonna be pooping on each other and that's it?

835
00:41:34,440 --> 00:41:36,440
And then that's just the thing?

836
00:41:36,440 --> 00:41:37,160
That's the new-

837
00:41:37,160 --> 00:41:39,160
Missionary was probably a fetish at some point.

838
00:41:39,160 --> 00:41:41,160
Listen, I'm gonna throw this out, though.

839
00:41:41,160 --> 00:41:45,720
What if it's not that it becomes more prevalent,

840
00:41:45,720 --> 00:41:47,560
but that it becomes simply more accepted?

841
00:41:48,760 --> 00:41:51,480
That there's not an increase in the performing of the act,

842
00:41:51,480 --> 00:41:55,400
but rather illumination brought to the performing of the act?

843
00:41:55,400 --> 00:41:57,880
What the fuck are you talking about?

844
00:41:57,880 --> 00:42:00,120
That everyone's always been pooping on each other.

845
00:42:00,120 --> 00:42:02,360
We've just been afraid to talk about it, people.

846
00:42:02,360 --> 00:42:08,120
I guess in the fucking atomic sense, yes.

847
00:42:09,080 --> 00:42:12,920
When you break it down to the subatomic level, yes.

848
00:42:13,640 --> 00:42:16,520
I don't think most fetishes can hold this kind of atomic scrutiny.

849
00:42:20,280 --> 00:42:22,680
Hey guys, my wife and I finally found out

850
00:42:22,680 --> 00:42:24,440
she's pregnant with our first child,

851
00:42:24,440 --> 00:42:26,760
and we're waiting to tell my mom face to face

852
00:42:26,760 --> 00:42:28,600
when we see her on Labor Day weekend.

853
00:42:28,600 --> 00:42:30,040
I hope she doesn't listen.

854
00:42:30,600 --> 00:42:32,760
I was wondering if you three have any tips

855
00:42:32,760 --> 00:42:35,320
for the grand reveal of a grandkid.

856
00:42:35,320 --> 00:42:37,880
That's from Inducing in Indianapolis.

857
00:42:37,880 --> 00:42:38,920
Oh, this is a good one.

858
00:42:38,920 --> 00:42:40,440
We've never gotten one of these before.

859
00:42:40,440 --> 00:42:44,840
No, we've gotten a lot, a lot of proposal things.

860
00:42:44,840 --> 00:42:47,720
Also a lot of how do I sleep with my best friend's girlfriend.

861
00:42:48,760 --> 00:42:49,800
Did we really?

862
00:42:49,800 --> 00:42:50,680
Yeah, we get a lot of those.

863
00:42:50,680 --> 00:42:53,400
I filtered those out because I don't want to hurt your delicate ears.

864
00:42:53,400 --> 00:42:55,640
But you just like created this-

865
00:42:55,640 --> 00:42:56,520
Oh no.

866
00:42:56,520 --> 00:42:58,120
This sense of terror in my mind

867
00:42:58,120 --> 00:43:01,720
that like 90% of the people that listen to our show are adulterers.

868
00:43:01,720 --> 00:43:02,920
Yeah, would be.

869
00:43:03,480 --> 00:43:05,640
We stop them because we do not help them.

870
00:43:05,640 --> 00:43:08,120
Like they're fucking waiting on our, waiting on your go guys.

871
00:43:08,840 --> 00:43:11,480
I've had my eye on Susan for a wicked long time.

872
00:43:11,480 --> 00:43:12,760
Wait, still waiting on the go ahead.

873
00:43:14,600 --> 00:43:17,960
If you were planning on having your mother-in-law listen to this,

874
00:43:17,960 --> 00:43:20,680
or your mom listen to this,

875
00:43:21,800 --> 00:43:23,480
I'm sorry that we put that part in there

876
00:43:23,480 --> 00:43:27,480
as like, if you're going to use this as your grand reveal.

877
00:43:27,480 --> 00:43:29,160
You are such an egotist.

878
00:43:29,160 --> 00:43:31,960
You really think they're going to be like,

879
00:43:31,960 --> 00:43:35,080
we just know that they're going to do it for us.

880
00:43:35,080 --> 00:43:37,720
So let's just plug these earbuds into grandma's ears.

881
00:43:37,720 --> 00:43:40,520
We could just record a whole episode where it's just like,

882
00:43:40,520 --> 00:43:42,440
you're fired and a bunch of like news

883
00:43:42,440 --> 00:43:44,440
that you want to get people through our podcast.

884
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:46,040
That would be great.

885
00:43:46,040 --> 00:43:48,760
Maybe like we could record people's answering machine messages.

886
00:43:49,800 --> 00:43:51,240
We're like the new Carl Castle.

887
00:43:51,240 --> 00:43:54,520
People have said that about us.

888
00:43:54,520 --> 00:43:55,880
Okay, you guys, that's not just me.

889
00:43:56,520 --> 00:43:59,880
I think the best way to tell her is to spend the whole party

890
00:43:59,880 --> 00:44:02,040
convincing your family that she's not drinking

891
00:44:02,040 --> 00:44:03,480
because of her alcohol problem.

892
00:44:05,480 --> 00:44:07,720
And then at the end be like, no, just kidding.

893
00:44:07,720 --> 00:44:09,240
She's, she's preggers.

894
00:44:09,240 --> 00:44:11,000
And everyone will be like twice as happy.

895
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:12,680
Or check this out, check this out.

896
00:44:12,680 --> 00:44:14,440
You turn all the lights off in the room

897
00:44:14,440 --> 00:44:15,640
and you gather everybody around

898
00:44:15,640 --> 00:44:17,720
and then you shine a flashlight on her back

899
00:44:17,720 --> 00:44:19,560
and then it'll show up on the wall.

900
00:44:19,560 --> 00:44:21,880
It's like the bat signal.

901
00:44:21,880 --> 00:44:25,080
It's a lot like the bat signal, but it's a baby signal.

902
00:44:25,640 --> 00:44:27,880
Oh, just say like everybody who's pregnant

903
00:44:27,880 --> 00:44:30,600
take one step forward and then she'll step forward.

904
00:44:30,600 --> 00:44:32,120
And we're like, oh, okay.

905
00:44:32,120 --> 00:44:33,160
That's pretty good.

906
00:44:33,160 --> 00:44:34,840
Yeah, that's a pressure situation

907
00:44:34,840 --> 00:44:36,920
because then what if someone else steps forward too?

908
00:44:38,120 --> 00:44:40,520
Then your fucking announcement is worth.

909
00:44:40,520 --> 00:44:42,600
What if everyone steps forward?

910
00:44:42,600 --> 00:44:43,560
We're all pregnant.

911
00:44:44,600 --> 00:44:45,960
Except you, Dave.

912
00:44:45,960 --> 00:44:46,920
Ah, damn it.

913
00:44:46,920 --> 00:44:47,720
Ah, damn it.

914
00:44:47,720 --> 00:44:50,040
Listen, Rod, thanks for coming into my office.

915
00:44:50,600 --> 00:44:52,760
This script you turned in for the new episode,

916
00:44:52,760 --> 00:44:54,120
The Twilight Zone.

917
00:44:54,120 --> 00:44:56,600
I don't think that this is gonna work.

918
00:44:56,600 --> 00:44:57,000
What do you mean?

919
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:58,840
We've all been pregnant for years.

920
00:44:58,840 --> 00:45:00,280
We've all been pregnant for years.

921
00:45:00,280 --> 00:45:02,440
The title of your new Twilight Zone episode

922
00:45:02,440 --> 00:45:05,080
is neither spooky nor sensical.

923
00:45:05,080 --> 00:45:07,480
It does not meet any of the basic criteria

924
00:45:07,480 --> 00:45:09,240
of being logically sound

925
00:45:09,240 --> 00:45:11,400
or in any way spooky for The Twilight Zone.

926
00:45:11,400 --> 00:45:12,920
But thank you for trying, Rod.

927
00:45:12,920 --> 00:45:14,760
Don't worry, we're gonna save it in a vault

928
00:45:14,760 --> 00:45:16,520
until Star Trek Next Generation

929
00:45:16,520 --> 00:45:18,440
and then they'll make the episode.

930
00:45:24,280 --> 00:45:27,400
You could write like a nice card.

931
00:45:29,160 --> 00:45:29,960
Skywriting.

932
00:45:32,040 --> 00:45:33,880
Can you just deliver the baby?

933
00:45:35,080 --> 00:45:36,200
That'd be a nice surprise.

934
00:45:36,200 --> 00:45:37,960
It's like when Sega announced the Sega Saturn.

935
00:45:37,960 --> 00:45:39,400
They're like, by the way, it's already out.

936
00:45:39,400 --> 00:45:40,440
You could do the same thing,

937
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:42,600
but the baby would be the Sega Saturn.

938
00:45:43,480 --> 00:45:45,320
Or just bring everyone to Sega Saturn.

939
00:45:45,320 --> 00:45:46,680
That would work too.

940
00:45:46,680 --> 00:45:49,000
What if you just rolled up with a baby in your arms

941
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:49,960
and be like, what?

942
00:45:49,960 --> 00:45:51,080
And be like, here's a preview.

943
00:45:52,680 --> 00:45:53,800
Then you drop the baby.

944
00:45:54,360 --> 00:45:56,200
One of these is gonna come out of her super soon.

945
00:45:56,200 --> 00:45:56,920
Can you believe that?

946
00:45:58,600 --> 00:46:00,040
Man, woman's bodies are a miracle.

947
00:46:00,040 --> 00:46:01,320
Am I right, you guys?

948
00:46:01,320 --> 00:46:02,440
Mom, be honest with me.

949
00:46:02,440 --> 00:46:03,640
Does Melanie look chunky?

950
00:46:05,400 --> 00:46:05,960
Here's the thing.

951
00:46:08,680 --> 00:46:10,840
I don't have kids.

952
00:46:12,040 --> 00:46:13,640
Fingers crossed, one day.

953
00:46:13,640 --> 00:46:18,840
But like, to me, if my child came to me

954
00:46:20,040 --> 00:46:22,760
and said, my wife is pregnant,

955
00:46:22,760 --> 00:46:24,280
what I'm going to hear is,

956
00:46:24,840 --> 00:46:27,080
I've had sex with this person at least one time.

957
00:46:29,480 --> 00:46:30,680
And that would be disquieting.

958
00:46:30,680 --> 00:46:31,960
Why don't you just keep it to yourself

959
00:46:31,960 --> 00:46:33,160
and then the baby will come

960
00:46:33,160 --> 00:46:36,760
and they'll be so happy about the actual arrival of the baby

961
00:46:36,760 --> 00:46:43,160
that they won't be disquieted by your obvious coitus?

962
00:46:43,160 --> 00:46:45,400
Well, you're like rubbing your sexual exploits

963
00:46:45,400 --> 00:46:47,640
in your mom's face at that point,

964
00:46:47,640 --> 00:46:48,600
which seems pretty rude.

965
00:46:48,600 --> 00:46:51,400
Yeah, make your wife show up in a t-shirt that says,

966
00:46:51,400 --> 00:46:55,640
conquered, because that's all you're saying with your baby

967
00:46:55,640 --> 00:46:57,960
is like, I put my flag in this mountain.

968
00:46:57,960 --> 00:46:59,880
Maybe like a really great mixtape.

969
00:47:01,640 --> 00:47:03,080
Something with baby in the title.

970
00:47:03,080 --> 00:47:05,480
Are there any songs with baby in the title?

971
00:47:05,480 --> 00:47:08,040
At least there's a Justin Bieber song

972
00:47:08,040 --> 00:47:11,800
with enough uses of the word baby

973
00:47:11,800 --> 00:47:13,800
to just make up for all the other tracks on the album.

974
00:47:13,800 --> 00:47:15,640
Oh, shit, flash mob.

975
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:17,960
Flash mob.

976
00:47:17,960 --> 00:47:21,160
Everybody seems like the baby from Alan McBeal.

977
00:47:21,160 --> 00:47:22,680
Travis, I'm trying to meme flash mob.

978
00:47:22,680 --> 00:47:24,680
Can you just lean in here with me?

979
00:47:24,680 --> 00:47:25,240
Yeah.

980
00:47:25,240 --> 00:47:26,040
Flash mob.

981
00:47:26,040 --> 00:47:27,000
Flash mob.

982
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:29,160
Because you tell him, that's how you tell him.

983
00:47:29,880 --> 00:47:31,960
Soldier boy tell him, can you get soldier boy?

984
00:47:34,600 --> 00:47:37,320
That'd be the best courier service.

985
00:47:37,960 --> 00:47:38,920
Soldier boy tell him.

986
00:47:38,920 --> 00:47:41,240
Soldier boy tell him that this is a summons

987
00:47:41,240 --> 00:47:42,040
to appear in court.

988
00:47:46,040 --> 00:47:48,280
Soldier boy tell him we all think he has a problem

989
00:47:48,280 --> 00:47:49,160
and needs to cut back.

990
00:47:50,600 --> 00:47:52,920
Soldier boy, we do wish that you would stop just sticking

991
00:47:52,920 --> 00:47:54,520
the notices on people's backs.

992
00:47:54,520 --> 00:47:57,240
I know, yes, you're Superman-ing that ho,

993
00:47:57,240 --> 00:47:58,840
but it is inappropriate.

994
00:47:58,840 --> 00:48:03,560
Soldier boy, I have a very dark secret to tell you

995
00:48:03,560 --> 00:48:06,760
and I need you, can I count on you

996
00:48:06,760 --> 00:48:10,440
to keep this message in the absolute confidence?

997
00:48:11,880 --> 00:48:13,000
Don't tell him.

998
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:13,880
Don't, soldier boy.

999
00:48:13,880 --> 00:48:14,440
Promise me.

1000
00:48:14,440 --> 00:48:15,000
Soldier boy.

1001
00:48:16,040 --> 00:48:19,640
I cheated on Margaret, soldier boy, you can't tell him.

1002
00:48:19,640 --> 00:48:21,240
To your grave, soldier boy.

1003
00:48:21,240 --> 00:48:22,120
To your fucking grave.

1004
00:48:22,120 --> 00:48:23,160
I gotta tell him.

1005
00:48:23,880 --> 00:48:25,400
Soldier boy, you can't.

1006
00:48:25,400 --> 00:48:26,440
I blame myself.

1007
00:48:26,440 --> 00:48:29,480
Robocop, you can't, soldier boy, I need you to be quiet.

1008
00:48:29,480 --> 00:48:31,160
Margaret is in the other room.

1009
00:48:31,160 --> 00:48:33,000
Why are you guys talking about robocop?

1010
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:34,360
Soldier boy, don't you fuck me.

1011
00:48:34,360 --> 00:48:35,400
Soldier boy, don't you fuck me.

1012
00:48:37,240 --> 00:48:38,040
You promised me.

1013
00:48:38,040 --> 00:48:38,760
Say the words.

1014
00:48:39,320 --> 00:48:41,080
Say the words, you promised not to tell him.

1015
00:48:46,040 --> 00:48:47,000
I hope he listens.

1016
00:48:47,720 --> 00:48:51,080
I hope so too, for so many reasons.

1017
00:48:51,960 --> 00:48:53,400
You want another yahoo?

1018
00:48:53,400 --> 00:48:54,440
Yeah, sure.

1019
00:48:54,440 --> 00:48:55,400
It's about soldier boy,

1020
00:48:55,400 --> 00:48:57,160
because that's all I'm thinking about for the rest of the show.

1021
00:48:58,360 --> 00:48:58,860
You!

1022
00:49:00,280 --> 00:49:02,040
This yahoo is sitting in also beverage.

1023
00:49:02,040 --> 00:49:04,920
Just eat a ghost.

1024
00:49:04,920 --> 00:49:06,760
Yahoo is also standing by Richard Chachere.

1025
00:49:09,160 --> 00:49:09,720
Thank you, Richard.

1026
00:49:09,720 --> 00:49:12,200
It's by yahoo answers user Ari, who asks,

1027
00:49:12,200 --> 00:49:14,680
can you get a DUI on a pair of Heelys?

1028
00:49:16,440 --> 00:49:19,640
I've heard you can get a DUI on anything but your feet.

1029
00:49:19,640 --> 00:49:23,000
Example, boat, bike, skateboard, rollerblades, et cetera.

1030
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:25,160
However, with Heelys, you're technically on your feet,

1031
00:49:25,160 --> 00:49:26,360
but also on wheels.

1032
00:49:26,360 --> 00:49:28,280
What is the true legal consequence of healing

1033
00:49:28,280 --> 00:49:29,560
under the influence?

1034
00:49:29,560 --> 00:49:35,240
Can you get a DUI on inline skates?

1035
00:49:35,240 --> 00:49:36,760
Yeah, I think so.

1036
00:49:36,760 --> 00:49:38,600
I think it's a state by state thing,

1037
00:49:38,600 --> 00:49:42,760
but I think any mode of transportation will get you busted.

1038
00:49:42,760 --> 00:49:44,760
I am deeply impressed by that,

1039
00:49:44,760 --> 00:49:47,880
because I have worn rollerblades in my life,

1040
00:49:47,880 --> 00:49:50,600
and I know what a difficult process it is

1041
00:49:50,600 --> 00:49:53,480
to get them on your feet and then you stand up once more.

1042
00:49:53,480 --> 00:49:54,520
You're gonna need stability.

1043
00:49:54,520 --> 00:49:57,000
When me and Clint Wilson,

1044
00:49:57,000 --> 00:49:58,920
we didn't have two pairs of rollerblades

1045
00:49:58,920 --> 00:49:59,800
between us, we just had one,

1046
00:49:59,800 --> 00:50:01,560
so we would do a pretty cool way

1047
00:50:01,560 --> 00:50:03,720
of getting our tooling around town

1048
00:50:03,720 --> 00:50:05,800
where we would both wear one shoe and one rollerblade

1049
00:50:05,800 --> 00:50:07,000
and just kind of push ourselves on it

1050
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:07,960
like a shitty skateboard.

1051
00:50:08,760 --> 00:50:10,040
That was a really cool look.

1052
00:50:10,040 --> 00:50:13,960
Man, we got a lot of nucky.

1053
00:50:19,240 --> 00:50:25,080
In West Virginia, Charleston guy got a DUI driving a tractor.

1054
00:50:25,080 --> 00:50:29,160
Well, that's like if he fucking hits anybody in a tractor

1055
00:50:29,160 --> 00:50:30,920
going any speed, that person's dead.

1056
00:50:31,720 --> 00:50:34,760
He was driving on a highway from reserves at night.

1057
00:50:34,760 --> 00:50:36,680
Well, that's, yes, I've been clearly,

1058
00:50:36,680 --> 00:50:38,600
that's not for sure.

1059
00:50:38,600 --> 00:50:41,320
Do you know what a cool night you have to have

1060
00:50:41,320 --> 00:50:43,080
if you're like, you know what I'm gonna do?

1061
00:50:44,280 --> 00:50:45,320
God, let's fire up that.

1062
00:50:45,320 --> 00:50:47,000
Why do I only tractor sober?

1063
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:48,440
I'm gonna get some tractoring done.

1064
00:50:48,440 --> 00:50:50,760
I did all the fucking corn.

1065
00:50:50,760 --> 00:50:52,840
What if I just kept doing it?

1066
00:50:53,720 --> 00:50:54,680
What if I just kept going?

1067
00:50:54,680 --> 00:50:56,360
I'm gonna tractor this whole nation of ours.

1068
00:50:56,360 --> 00:50:56,760
You know what?

1069
00:50:56,760 --> 00:51:00,920
It's 2013 and my resolution was to stop limiting myself.

1070
00:51:00,920 --> 00:51:02,600
I'm gonna tractor everything.

1071
00:51:02,600 --> 00:51:03,640
I'm the modern day

1072
00:51:03,640 --> 00:51:06,920
and also feloniously drunk Johnny Appleseed.

1073
00:51:08,600 --> 00:51:10,200
But like the reverse Johnny Appleseed.

1074
00:51:10,200 --> 00:51:10,680
But the reverse.

1075
00:51:10,680 --> 00:51:11,640
Pairing stuff up.

1076
00:51:11,640 --> 00:51:13,560
I'm just like running into buildings.

1077
00:51:13,560 --> 00:51:17,000
I'm like a weird Johnny Appleseed Billy Joel hybrid.

1078
00:51:18,440 --> 00:51:19,880
Johnny Billyseed.

1079
00:51:19,880 --> 00:51:21,240
I'm Johnny Billyseed.

1080
00:51:21,240 --> 00:51:25,880
This is a cool house.

1081
00:51:25,880 --> 00:51:27,880
Now you're part of a great American legend.

1082
00:51:29,720 --> 00:51:31,560
I destroyed your dining room

1083
00:51:31,560 --> 00:51:33,160
but your front yard's good to go

1084
00:51:33,160 --> 00:51:36,760
if you want to play on any corn or wheat or soybeans.

1085
00:51:36,760 --> 00:51:39,000
This is actually a wonderful way to get your

1086
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:41,640
if you fuck up like super bad

1087
00:51:42,280 --> 00:51:45,640
the only recourse you have is to continue fucking up

1088
00:51:46,200 --> 00:51:50,120
so bad that you make that person part of an American legend.

1089
00:51:50,120 --> 00:51:53,240
If you drag a giant ax through someone's house

1090
00:51:53,240 --> 00:51:54,200
they're pissed.

1091
00:51:54,200 --> 00:51:55,880
If you drive it through a hundred houses

1092
00:51:55,880 --> 00:51:57,080
they're celebrities.

1093
00:51:57,080 --> 00:51:58,200
Right, right.

1094
00:51:59,160 --> 00:52:01,080
You think that the fucking people

1095
00:52:01,880 --> 00:52:06,120
Billy Joel crashes his sedan into somebody's foyer

1096
00:52:06,120 --> 00:52:07,880
and obviously they're they're woken up.

1097
00:52:07,880 --> 00:52:10,040
They're startled and they go downstairs

1098
00:52:10,040 --> 00:52:12,600
and Billy Joel steps out like I fucked up.

1099
00:52:15,240 --> 00:52:16,520
I fucked up.

1100
00:52:16,520 --> 00:52:17,960
They're like Billy it's okay.

1101
00:52:17,960 --> 00:52:22,360
Hey Billy I'm gonna tell this story forever Billy.

1102
00:52:22,360 --> 00:52:24,680
We're gonna be at a bar and piano man will come on.

1103
00:52:24,680 --> 00:52:27,560
I could I could fuck anybody at that bar at that point.

1104
00:52:29,400 --> 00:52:31,640
I can show you Billy Joel's car hole.

1105
00:52:33,240 --> 00:52:34,360
I'm never fixing this shit.

1106
00:52:34,360 --> 00:52:36,680
Come back to my place I can show you his car hole.

1107
00:52:37,720 --> 00:52:39,080
I want to meet the guy who

1108
00:52:41,400 --> 00:52:44,280
fucking steps out of his outside of the bar

1109
00:52:44,280 --> 00:52:45,800
like thanks guys I had a fun night.

1110
00:52:45,800 --> 00:52:47,720
Whee!

1111
00:52:47,720 --> 00:52:48,680
And Heely's away.

1112
00:52:49,560 --> 00:52:50,920
Heely's into the moon set.

1113
00:52:53,720 --> 00:52:56,040
I would have to be drunk to wear Heely's

1114
00:52:56,040 --> 00:52:57,960
to think I could pull that off actually.

1115
00:52:59,480 --> 00:53:01,240
How do you how do you convince the cops

1116
00:53:01,240 --> 00:53:02,440
you weren't wearing Heely's?

1117
00:53:02,440 --> 00:53:04,360
Can you tell them like nah it's just ice.

1118
00:53:04,360 --> 00:53:05,160
Nah they're just shoes.

1119
00:53:06,680 --> 00:53:07,240
I'm wearing shoes.

1120
00:53:07,240 --> 00:53:09,000
Can you walk the straight line?

1121
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:10,120
No I cannot.

1122
00:53:10,120 --> 00:53:12,360
I was doing a perpetual Michael Jackson dance.

1123
00:53:13,880 --> 00:53:15,160
I'm the greatest dancer.

1124
00:53:15,160 --> 00:53:16,520
I'm pretty much the greatest dancer.

1125
00:53:17,400 --> 00:53:20,120
Sir we could hear you wheeing all the way down the street.

1126
00:53:20,120 --> 00:53:21,720
We know that you were wearing Heely's.

1127
00:53:21,720 --> 00:53:22,360
I don't.

1128
00:53:22,360 --> 00:53:23,320
I was parkouring.

1129
00:53:23,320 --> 00:53:24,440
Yeah that's a DUI too.

1130
00:53:24,440 --> 00:53:25,320
You can't parkour.

1131
00:53:26,440 --> 00:53:27,080
You can't.

1132
00:53:27,080 --> 00:53:28,360
What if you flip into traffic?

1133
00:53:31,720 --> 00:53:35,080
What if you stunt like through an elementary school window?

1134
00:53:36,920 --> 00:53:40,520
I have a problem with someone planning their weekend this thoroughly.

1135
00:53:40,520 --> 00:53:42,040
I have a problem with so well.

1136
00:53:42,040 --> 00:53:45,560
I'm gonna be wearing the Heely's for an earlier activity.

1137
00:53:45,560 --> 00:53:46,840
Do I need to go home and change?

1138
00:53:48,040 --> 00:53:49,240
I'm gonna get drunk.

1139
00:53:50,840 --> 00:53:52,120
Here's the order of operations.

1140
00:53:52,120 --> 00:53:54,440
I'm going to the skate park with my Heely's.

1141
00:53:55,080 --> 00:53:57,160
I just assumed that that's where you stunt.

1142
00:53:58,200 --> 00:53:58,920
I'm gonna drink.

1143
00:53:59,480 --> 00:54:01,400
Do I need to work a home visit in there somewhere?

1144
00:54:04,840 --> 00:54:06,680
Thank you so much for listening to our program.

1145
00:54:06,680 --> 00:54:08,760
We hope you had a lot of fun listening to it.

1146
00:54:08,760 --> 00:54:13,480
Want to say a quick thank you to people who've mailed us stuff through snail mail.

1147
00:54:13,480 --> 00:54:18,520
Our address is P.O. Box 54 Huntington, West Virginia 25706.

1148
00:54:18,520 --> 00:54:21,400
Thank you to Julie Van Wye and Ian Van Wye.

1149
00:54:21,400 --> 00:54:27,080
They sent us some pretzels that they baked themselves and sent along pictures.

1150
00:54:27,080 --> 00:54:27,880
That's awesome.

1151
00:54:27,880 --> 00:54:30,120
Oh I ate them with Sydney and they were so good.

1152
00:54:30,120 --> 00:54:31,160
We got back from vacation.

1153
00:54:31,160 --> 00:54:32,120
Did you eat all of them?

1154
00:54:32,120 --> 00:54:34,280
It was the only thing in the house and we ate them all.

1155
00:54:34,280 --> 00:54:35,400
You ate all of them?

1156
00:54:35,400 --> 00:54:37,480
Just send us some more around the holidays so I can share.

1157
00:54:37,480 --> 00:54:42,200
We got some beautiful yolo earrings with some one-up mushrooms on them.

1158
00:54:42,200 --> 00:54:46,840
A postcard from what appears to be Dean Snodgrass that just says hey.

1159
00:54:48,120 --> 00:54:49,560
We got an email from Jeanette.

1160
00:54:49,560 --> 00:54:51,400
He's gonna fucking kill all three of us.

1161
00:54:52,040 --> 00:54:52,760
I know.

1162
00:54:52,760 --> 00:54:53,800
We got an email.

1163
00:54:53,800 --> 00:55:00,040
We got a postcard from Maria that has a lenticular picture of Dawson City.

1164
00:55:00,040 --> 00:55:00,680
That's beautiful.

1165
00:55:01,720 --> 00:55:05,800
Our uncle Travelin' Matt sent us one from the Phoenix Art Museum.

1166
00:55:05,800 --> 00:55:09,880
We got a postcard from another one from uncle Travelin' Matt from Colorado.

1167
00:55:09,880 --> 00:55:10,600
He's on tour.

1168
00:55:12,200 --> 00:55:13,560
A baby announcement.

1169
00:55:13,560 --> 00:55:14,920
This is actually really good.

1170
00:55:14,920 --> 00:55:20,520
We got a baby announcement from Joshua and Danielle that says we're thrilled to announce

1171
00:55:20,520 --> 00:55:21,800
having a baby.

1172
00:55:21,800 --> 00:55:25,480
Baby Cygnus expected due date is November 12th.

1173
00:55:26,040 --> 00:55:27,720
Stay tuned for more information.

1174
00:55:27,720 --> 00:55:32,040
And then here they have just handwritten mission accomplished.

1175
00:55:33,960 --> 00:55:34,600
Pretty great.

1176
00:55:34,600 --> 00:55:43,160
That's really got another great postcard from Stephanie and a lovely note from Ty Nielsen

1177
00:55:43,160 --> 00:55:45,080
and so much more from her.

1178
00:55:45,080 --> 00:55:47,800
A copy of Space Jam I think from Tyne.

1179
00:55:47,800 --> 00:55:48,360
On DVD?

1180
00:55:48,360 --> 00:55:48,440
I don't know.

1181
00:55:48,440 --> 00:55:48,920
Ty Nielsen.

1182
00:55:48,920 --> 00:55:49,480
Man, I love him.

1183
00:55:49,480 --> 00:55:50,600
Is it out on Blu-Ray yet?

1184
00:55:51,400 --> 00:55:58,440
It is a four pack in this box that includes Looney Tunes the movies, Looney Tunes Back

1185
00:55:58,440 --> 00:56:04,920
in Action the movie, Space Jam, Osmosis Jones.

1186
00:56:04,920 --> 00:56:06,680
That's a fucking great movie.

1187
00:56:06,680 --> 00:56:14,840
And then what I can only assume is they just had this lying around and they wanted to toss

1188
00:56:14,840 --> 00:56:15,400
it in.

1189
00:56:15,400 --> 00:56:16,600
I want to see if you guys can see.

1190
00:56:16,600 --> 00:56:20,360
I want to throw it up on my cam so you guys can see there.

1191
00:56:20,360 --> 00:56:25,240
It's just called Funky Monkey and it's a picture of a monkey wearing headphones giving

1192
00:56:25,240 --> 00:56:28,200
like a sort of like a DJ Tiesto fist bump.

1193
00:56:28,200 --> 00:56:31,640
I think whenever they started putting this four pack together the people were like let's

1194
00:56:31,640 --> 00:56:33,480
do a four pack because they were drunk.

1195
00:56:33,480 --> 00:56:37,640
Let's do a four pack of movies with Bill Murray and cartoons and they were like there's

1196
00:56:37,640 --> 00:56:39,240
only two of those like ah fuck it.

1197
00:56:39,240 --> 00:56:40,120
What else we got?

1198
00:56:40,120 --> 00:56:40,840
Funky Monkey?

1199
00:56:40,840 --> 00:56:41,880
Sure, I guess.

1200
00:56:41,880 --> 00:56:46,120
We got a lot of these leftover Funky Monkey DVDs from the MVP.

1201
00:56:46,760 --> 00:56:49,640
Can we splice Bill Murray and also cartoons into that?

1202
00:56:49,640 --> 00:56:54,680
I also want to say thank you again to Hulu Plus where you can binge on thousands of hit

1203
00:56:54,680 --> 00:56:55,000
shows.

1204
00:56:55,800 --> 00:56:57,320
They're supporters of the show.

1205
00:56:57,320 --> 00:56:58,280
It's a great deal.

1206
00:56:58,280 --> 00:56:59,240

1207
00:56:59,240 --> 00:57:04,200
Go to huluplus.com and just forward slash my brother for the extended free trial.

1208
00:57:04,920 --> 00:57:05,960
Don't you slash me.

1209
00:57:07,720 --> 00:57:08,600
Slash my brother.

1210
00:57:11,160 --> 00:57:13,800
I want to throw out a special thanks to Allison Greenberg.

1211
00:57:13,800 --> 00:57:17,160
She sent us an email with 50 yahoo answers in them.

1212
00:57:19,320 --> 00:57:24,760
I didn't get time to do any of them on the show but I appreciate it must have taken like

1213
00:57:24,760 --> 00:57:27,240
a week of preparation so thank you.

1214
00:57:27,240 --> 00:57:30,680
I also want to thank John Roderick and the Long Winters for the use of our theme song

1215
00:57:30,680 --> 00:57:33,000
Is a Departure off the album Putting the Days to Bed.

1216
00:57:34,440 --> 00:57:35,800
You can find it on iTunes.

1217
00:57:35,800 --> 00:57:37,320
You can probably find it on Spotify.

1218
00:57:37,320 --> 00:57:38,920
I'm not sure how much of a kickback he gets.

1219
00:57:38,920 --> 00:57:41,880
I know that it's tricky with streaming, media rights.

1220
00:57:43,880 --> 00:57:49,080
I know that Metallica has raised quite a stink about that very issue and so if by bringing

1221
00:57:49,080 --> 00:57:53,320
up Spotify I've injured John Roderick's prospects I apologize.

1222
00:57:53,320 --> 00:57:57,960
And on that grim note we're going to end this episode with a final question from

1223
00:57:58,840 --> 00:58:00,120
young Griffin McElroy.

1224
00:58:01,160 --> 00:58:03,560
This yahoo answer was sent in by Steven Isaacson.

1225
00:58:03,560 --> 00:58:04,280
Thank you Steven.

1226
00:58:04,280 --> 00:58:06,440
It's by yahoo answer user Cooper who asks.

1227
00:58:08,200 --> 00:58:13,880
Is it true if you take a cop's badge that they're not a cop anymore and you're the cop?

1228
00:58:16,920 --> 00:58:17,800
I'm Justin McElroy.

1229
00:58:17,800 --> 00:58:18,760
I'm Travis McElroy.

1230
00:58:18,760 --> 00:58:19,960
I'm Griffin McElroy.

1231
00:58:19,960 --> 00:58:21,400
This has been my brother my brother and me.

1232
00:58:21,400 --> 00:58:22,520
Kiss your dad.

1233
00:58:22,520 --> 00:58:24,520
Square in the lips.
