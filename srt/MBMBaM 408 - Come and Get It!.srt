1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:31,840
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:46,720
Hello everybody and welcome, my brother, my brother, me, and advice show for the

6
00:00:46,720 --> 00:00:52,000
modern era. I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy. I am your middlest brother, Travis

7
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:57,520
McElroy. I'm your sweet baby brother and 30 under 30 media luminary, Griffin McElroy.

8
00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:01,520
Well, it's time to take my brother, my brother, me to the next level.

9
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:08,240
Are we getting married to like cereal or something?

10
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:10,160
Are we getting a fourth brother finally?

11
00:01:10,160 --> 00:01:13,680
No, no fourth brother. Travis, I told you the budget just isn't there.

12
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:20,640
We could CGI the fourth brother. It would be like Travis, but I don't know,

13
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:25,440
red hair? No, I have red hair now. Travis, but made of gold.

14
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:29,680
I have finished the Steve Martin masterclass in comedy.

15
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:32,320
I can't fucking believe we're talking about this again.

16
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:40,080
I am ready to, here is my kind of thing. I have absorbed the entirety of the masterclass.

17
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:49,680
It comes at a retail value of $90. I will impose my knowledge to you for half that amount.

18
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:50,320
Us?

19
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:55,040
Yes. Well, we could start with you guys and then we could just take this show on the road.

20
00:01:55,040 --> 00:02:01,120
Now, you all should probably charge one fourth as much as I, the math isn't clean.

21
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:02,400
Wait, hold on.

22
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:07,360
2250, I think. And you charge half as much as you paid me because you are giving this

23
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:11,280
information away third hand at this point. And charge other people, and then how much

24
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:13,360
of that money do you have to kick back up to Steve?

25
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:18,960
It's not a big deal. It's just like 10% of everything I earn goes back to, oh.

26
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:20,720
Yeah, Justin.

27
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:25,760
Yeah, I see. I see what he wrote me into. Let's just get a dry run at it though.

28
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:30,960
I'm here. I'm ready to answer your comedy questions from you two. Whatever.

29
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:36,400
I want to hear your sincere queries about comedy.

30
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:37,040
I got a great one.

31
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:38,000
I'm ready to help.

32
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:38,960
Let's say you're part of a-

33
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:40,560
Hold on. Can you raise your hand for me?

34
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:42,800
Yeah, I'm doing it.

35
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:44,240
Griffin?

36
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:46,320
Yeah, I wasn't doing it. Eat my nards.

37
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:46,820
Got him.

38
00:02:46,820 --> 00:02:56,580
So, Steve Junior, Steve TA, say I was part of a comedy outfit, a long-term project that's

39
00:02:56,580 --> 00:03:03,780
been running for eight years or so. And then there was this recurring bit that the other

40
00:03:03,780 --> 00:03:09,940
people in the outfit were really enthusiastic about, but I wasn't. One, what is the right

41
00:03:09,940 --> 00:03:16,420
way to tell them we really shouldn't do that bit again? And number two, if they still want

42
00:03:16,420 --> 00:03:21,540
to just sort of break on through to the other side of comedy, which is tragedy or at the

43
00:03:21,540 --> 00:03:28,820
very least boredom, is it okay to walk away and find new outfit? What do you think about

44
00:03:28,820 --> 00:03:30,180
that, Mr. Steve Junior?

45
00:03:31,220 --> 00:03:35,780
Interesting, huh? Gosh, you really stopped me midway through eating my banana.

46
00:03:37,140 --> 00:03:40,740
That's the funniest fruit, so I'll give you that one, Steve Junior. You got it good.

47
00:03:40,740 --> 00:03:47,860
Here's what I do in your scenario. What I do is I call Marty Short and I say, is this

48
00:03:47,860 --> 00:03:48,360
funny?

49
00:03:48,980 --> 00:03:52,260
Hold on, that's what Steve would do or that's what Steve Junior would do?

50
00:03:52,260 --> 00:03:55,620
This is what Steve told me to do, guys. I don't actually know.

51
00:03:55,620 --> 00:03:56,180
Okay.

52
00:03:56,180 --> 00:04:00,980
I don't actually know, I don't even know Martin Short's phone number, but he just says,

53
00:04:00,980 --> 00:04:04,100
call Marty Short and ask him if it's funny.

54
00:04:04,100 --> 00:04:09,380
Yeah, yeah. And he would say if it was like this, for instance, this bit, this intro,

55
00:04:09,380 --> 00:04:14,180
he would say, and that patented Marty Short voice, he'd be like, no, you know?

56
00:04:14,180 --> 00:04:18,020
Do we have any other questions? What about you, bearded fellow?

57
00:04:18,020 --> 00:04:19,460
Yeah, it's Travis.

58
00:04:20,020 --> 00:04:21,300
Oh, great, Travis.

59
00:04:21,300 --> 00:04:24,020
I mean, I paid for the course, you could learn my name.

60
00:04:24,580 --> 00:04:26,580
Sure, can you raise your hand real quick?

61
00:04:26,580 --> 00:04:27,380
It is raised.

62
00:04:27,380 --> 00:04:27,940
Oh, it's raised.

63
00:04:27,940 --> 00:04:28,740
Up your butt.

64
00:04:29,620 --> 00:04:34,020
Okay, this is good too. You guys are already, you should be the teachers.

65
00:04:34,020 --> 00:04:42,180
I guess my question is, when it comes to like working blue, how blue is too blue?

66
00:04:42,180 --> 00:04:50,500
You know, PC culture is so different than it was when I was starting in the 70s doing my thing.

67
00:04:51,380 --> 00:04:54,500
And some people are into the PC thing and some people aren't.

68
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:59,460
One thing that everybody can agree on though is banjo music.

69
00:04:59,460 --> 00:05:00,180
Oh.

70
00:05:00,180 --> 00:05:04,420
So you should do more of that.

71
00:05:04,420 --> 00:05:07,460
That can't possibly have been in the lessons, Justin.

72
00:05:07,460 --> 00:05:10,500
Just more banjo music and if you're stuck, call Marty Short.

73
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:12,180
It was about a three minute long video.

74
00:05:13,140 --> 00:05:17,780
So the whole class, the whole class is just a three minute long video of him playing banjo

75
00:05:18,340 --> 00:05:22,420
and trying to convince you to call Marty Short and ask him if it's funny.

76
00:05:22,420 --> 00:05:29,140
Is it funny to pay $90 for a course and then give them two weeks worth of free advertising?

77
00:05:29,140 --> 00:05:33,380
It's un-fucking-believe. I am beyond belief.

78
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:38,980
Okay, well, I mean, I was just trying to, here's the way I kind of figured it.

79
00:05:38,980 --> 00:05:42,500
It's like, if I managed to turn it into something funny,

80
00:05:43,460 --> 00:05:48,500
then one, I feel like it's a business expense at that point that I have recouped.

81
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:48,980
Yeah.

82
00:05:48,980 --> 00:05:53,780
And two, then Steve knows that his time was well spent

83
00:05:53,780 --> 00:05:56,260
because something really funny came out of it from me.

84
00:05:56,260 --> 00:06:00,820
His stew, his bride's pupil, Justin, wild and crazy guy, McElroy.

85
00:06:00,820 --> 00:06:04,180
Right, but neither of those things happened is the only problem.

86
00:06:04,180 --> 00:06:09,060
Okay, negative feedback is something that's going to come to everybody in their career.

87
00:06:09,060 --> 00:06:12,900
But one thing that everybody loves is this fucking banjo and calling Marty Short.

88
00:06:14,260 --> 00:06:18,740
I'm like, we get it. I get it. I gotta eat. I got it. I do have it.

89
00:06:18,740 --> 00:06:21,860
You gave it, you gave it, you gave it to me and I have it now.

90
00:06:21,860 --> 00:06:29,620
Let's say that you have to do a speech at the MoMA for a Tom Hanks ceremony honoring him.

91
00:06:29,620 --> 00:06:32,180
Oh, I love this because I actually do have to do that.

92
00:06:32,180 --> 00:06:34,420
Good. So what you're going to want to start with is like,

93
00:06:34,420 --> 00:06:38,660
what things do you know about Tom personally?

94
00:06:38,660 --> 00:06:42,340
Not the stuff that people read in the papers, but like your own interactions with him.

95
00:06:42,340 --> 00:06:43,300
Soft hands.

96
00:06:44,020 --> 00:06:45,380
Soft hands. That's good.

97
00:06:45,380 --> 00:06:48,580
Softer than you think, but not as soft as you'd hope.

98
00:06:48,580 --> 00:06:50,740
Okay, good. See, that's funny already.

99
00:06:50,740 --> 00:06:52,820
Soft hands, hard dick.

100
00:06:53,700 --> 00:06:56,100
Yep. If there's one thing I know, it's soft hands.

101
00:06:56,100 --> 00:06:59,140
But if there's two things I know, it's hard dick.

102
00:06:59,140 --> 00:07:02,020
Uh, little fella back there, you didn't raise your hand.

103
00:07:02,020 --> 00:07:06,100
I love that you want to contribute and you're excited about being part of the class.

104
00:07:06,100 --> 00:07:07,220
I do need to see that hands.

105
00:07:07,220 --> 00:07:10,580
Yeah, no, come back. Here's my hand, Stephen. You talked about getting nasty.

106
00:07:10,580 --> 00:07:13,940
Let's get nasty. I want you to talk about fucking Tom Hanks throbbing thong.

107
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:17,460
I want to hear you talk about that right now in your own voice.

108
00:07:17,460 --> 00:07:19,220
Talk about his throbbing thong.

109
00:07:19,220 --> 00:07:25,060
Well, PC culture has come a long way since the 60s when I was a writer on the Smothers Brothers.

110
00:07:25,060 --> 00:07:29,620
And we used to just take that envelope and push it right out the window.

111
00:07:30,340 --> 00:07:33,860
Sure. And the banjo, too, would come in there somewhere.

112
00:07:34,900 --> 00:07:38,180
So this is my Brother by Brother video. It's an advice show for the modern era.

113
00:07:38,180 --> 00:07:40,900
We take your questions and turn them alchemy-like into wisdom.

114
00:07:40,900 --> 00:07:45,060
And now, for the first time in 408 episodes,

115
00:07:45,060 --> 00:07:48,580
this one's going to be funny because I know what I'm doing.

116
00:07:48,580 --> 00:07:49,140
Yeah, sure.

117
00:07:49,140 --> 00:07:50,020
Good, good, good.

118
00:07:50,020 --> 00:07:53,460
I work in an art museum and people are always asking me about my art.

119
00:07:53,460 --> 00:07:56,100
The problem is I'm not an art student. I just work there.

120
00:07:56,100 --> 00:07:59,540
I have blue hair and I'm standing there looking at art. So I get it.

121
00:07:59,540 --> 00:08:04,260
But it's always awkward when they find out I'm actually a law student.

122
00:08:04,260 --> 00:08:05,780
And often they don't believe me.

123
00:08:05,780 --> 00:08:09,380
They usually make an awkward comment about the way I look to justify the assumption.

124
00:08:09,380 --> 00:08:12,340
What can I say to make the whole thing less weird?

125
00:08:12,340 --> 00:08:13,620
That's from Deceptive in DC.

126
00:08:14,180 --> 00:08:18,340
Law is just a kind of art, the art of the deal.

127
00:08:18,340 --> 00:08:20,020
Yeah, it's so subjective.

128
00:08:20,020 --> 00:08:20,660
Thank you.

129
00:08:20,660 --> 00:08:21,540
Yeah, the art.

130
00:08:22,420 --> 00:08:24,500
Prior art, that's a law thing.

131
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:25,540
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

132
00:08:25,540 --> 00:08:31,700
I would give any amount of money to routinely be set up with the line,

133
00:08:31,700 --> 00:08:33,380
tell me about your art.

134
00:08:34,020 --> 00:08:36,260
So I could say, oh, my art?

135
00:08:36,260 --> 00:08:40,820
And then, I don't know, maybe play the spoons or like lift up my shirt

136
00:08:40,820 --> 00:08:45,460
and I've painted a painting on my belly or, you know, just various things.

137
00:08:45,460 --> 00:08:48,740
I feel like there's so many good punchlines you could deliver.

138
00:08:48,740 --> 00:08:49,380
That's good.

139
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:52,580
Art doesn't just have to be paint on paper.

140
00:08:52,580 --> 00:08:52,900
Exactly.

141
00:08:52,900 --> 00:08:54,020
Art can be anything.

142
00:08:54,020 --> 00:08:55,460
So they say, tell me about your art.

143
00:08:55,460 --> 00:08:57,700
And you pull out a little, you know, a foosball.

144
00:08:57,700 --> 00:08:59,060
And you're like, I'm a master on that table.

145
00:08:59,060 --> 00:09:00,020
Let me show you.

146
00:09:00,020 --> 00:09:03,860
And you throw it as hard as you can across the room because you don't have a table.

147
00:09:03,860 --> 00:09:06,180
But I think it'll still get the point across.

148
00:09:07,140 --> 00:09:08,580
Yeah, and you do it.

149
00:09:08,580 --> 00:09:09,940
You kind of flick it across the room.

150
00:09:09,940 --> 00:09:10,420
And what's that?

151
00:09:10,420 --> 00:09:14,100
Oh, it pops right into the mouth of that guy that's screaming in that one painting.

152
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:15,540
And you're like, go.

153
00:09:15,540 --> 00:09:16,180
Yeah, go.

154
00:09:16,180 --> 00:09:18,580
You punch a big hole in the screaming painting.

155
00:09:18,580 --> 00:09:22,180
And they're like, oh my god, the alarms are going off now.

156
00:09:22,180 --> 00:09:26,020
And you say, I know, but this is a pretty good shot right into the scream mouth, huh?

157
00:09:26,020 --> 00:09:26,660
Go.

158
00:09:26,660 --> 00:09:28,020
Or you say, like, my art.

159
00:09:28,020 --> 00:09:29,300
And then you heist the painting.

160
00:09:29,300 --> 00:09:32,820
And you're like, I'm a master thief.

161
00:09:32,820 --> 00:09:33,860
That's my art.

162
00:09:33,860 --> 00:09:35,700
It's the art of stealing shit.

163
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:37,140
And then you paint it on them.

164
00:09:37,140 --> 00:09:39,460
But then you get them out of prison because that's your real art.

165
00:09:39,460 --> 00:09:40,180
You're a lawyer.

166
00:09:40,180 --> 00:09:45,220
There's a guy I follow on YouTube that my daughter loves his work.

167
00:09:45,220 --> 00:09:47,300
And I'm a fan too, named Joseph.

168
00:09:47,300 --> 00:09:51,620
And he does like Rube Goldberg machines.

169
00:09:51,620 --> 00:09:53,780
And he calls himself a kinetic artist.

170
00:09:54,340 --> 00:09:57,380
And that seems like a pretty easy one to lie about.

171
00:09:57,380 --> 00:10:01,860
Because if you say you're a kinetic artist, no one's really going to push you on it.

172
00:10:01,860 --> 00:10:06,500
And if they do, you just knock a can of pins over and be like, well,

173
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:08,980
this one is still in the form of stages.

174
00:10:08,980 --> 00:10:10,260
Look at how they scattered.

175
00:10:10,260 --> 00:10:11,220
Isn't that interesting?

176
00:10:11,220 --> 00:10:12,340
It's definitely interesting.

177
00:10:12,340 --> 00:10:14,740
I knew they would all kind of do that.

178
00:10:15,460 --> 00:10:18,020
Just like that is how I meant for it to happen.

179
00:10:18,020 --> 00:10:19,060
Oh, wait, I've got it.

180
00:10:19,940 --> 00:10:20,580
I've got it.

181
00:10:20,580 --> 00:10:23,940
How many times have you been in a museum, right?

182
00:10:23,940 --> 00:10:25,860
And you come across something and you're like,

183
00:10:25,860 --> 00:10:28,180
is that a light switch or is that a piece of art?

184
00:10:28,180 --> 00:10:31,300
What you do is you claim that light switch as your art.

185
00:10:31,300 --> 00:10:32,980
Yeah, put a sticker on it.

186
00:10:32,980 --> 00:10:33,300
Right?

187
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:35,300
And like you walk over to a trash can and you're like,

188
00:10:35,940 --> 00:10:36,900
this is my art.

189
00:10:36,900 --> 00:10:37,620
This bench.

190
00:10:37,620 --> 00:10:38,580
I made this bench.

191
00:10:38,580 --> 00:10:39,220
I love that.

192
00:10:39,860 --> 00:10:42,420
And then they're like, oh shit, I sat on that bench.

193
00:10:42,420 --> 00:10:43,780
And you say, what?

194
00:10:43,780 --> 00:10:45,540
And you get really mad about it.

195
00:10:45,540 --> 00:10:48,980
Who put this hippopotamus sticker on my light switch for the museum?

196
00:10:49,620 --> 00:10:50,820
You don't understand.

197
00:10:50,820 --> 00:10:54,180
The hippopotamus is my childhood.

198
00:10:55,620 --> 00:10:59,540
The light switch represents an old light switch I had in my house.

199
00:10:59,540 --> 00:11:01,060
And if you don't understand, that's on you.

200
00:11:01,060 --> 00:11:02,420
Because it's my art and it's subjective.

201
00:11:02,420 --> 00:11:03,060
Look at my hair.

202
00:11:03,060 --> 00:11:03,940
You know it's true.

203
00:11:03,940 --> 00:11:08,980
What if you're at the museum and when someone's like looking at a painting,

204
00:11:08,980 --> 00:11:12,020
you come up behind them and say, it belongs to the museum.

205
00:11:12,020 --> 00:11:14,180
And they would say, yeah, it is.

206
00:11:14,180 --> 00:11:14,980
It's in one.

207
00:11:14,980 --> 00:11:17,620
And you say, hello, impression is my art.

208
00:11:17,620 --> 00:11:19,140
I am not Harrison Ford.

209
00:11:19,140 --> 00:11:20,660
I'm in fact this question asked.

210
00:11:20,660 --> 00:11:22,660
Oh, or you walk up behind them and what's that?

211
00:11:22,660 --> 00:11:26,020
You're dressed like Caesar and you say, I was the statue of Caesar,

212
00:11:26,020 --> 00:11:29,460
but I came to life and you have to help me recover a tablet.

213
00:11:30,020 --> 00:11:30,980
I am art.

214
00:11:30,980 --> 00:11:32,020
I am art.

215
00:11:32,020 --> 00:11:33,700
I've been art the whole time.

216
00:11:33,700 --> 00:11:34,500
Art the whole time.

217
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:37,060
I'm living art for thousands of years.

218
00:11:37,060 --> 00:11:38,100
Help me, Ben Stiller.

219
00:11:39,700 --> 00:11:42,340
Help me sneak some pants onto David.

220
00:11:42,340 --> 00:11:43,780
Because come on, man.

221
00:11:43,780 --> 00:11:46,580
Every time he wakes up at night, it's a whole thing.

222
00:11:46,580 --> 00:11:47,300
It's a whole thing.

223
00:11:47,300 --> 00:11:47,860
Where's that?

224
00:11:48,420 --> 00:11:50,020
You know, Night at the Museum.

225
00:11:50,020 --> 00:11:54,580
Where Ben Stiller turns around, there's a big flesh dick in his face.

226
00:11:54,580 --> 00:11:54,900
What?

227
00:11:54,900 --> 00:11:57,460
That's the most unrealistic thing about Night at the Museum.

228
00:11:57,460 --> 00:12:00,980
Because you know, the first thing he would say is, I'm stealing all of you.

229
00:12:00,980 --> 00:12:03,620
Yeah, everybody get in my van.

230
00:12:03,620 --> 00:12:05,300
I'm going to steal you all.

231
00:12:05,300 --> 00:12:09,700
And you get too far from the museum and like, I don't feel so pop on Mona Lisa now again.

232
00:12:09,700 --> 00:12:10,660
You're like, ha ha ha.

233
00:12:10,660 --> 00:12:11,460
Hell yeah, you are.

234
00:12:11,460 --> 00:12:12,580
Actually, you're confused.

235
00:12:12,580 --> 00:12:17,700
You are a beach house in Maui because I sold you already in my mind.

236
00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:18,660
How about Yahoo?

237
00:12:18,660 --> 00:12:19,140
Yeah.

238
00:12:19,140 --> 00:12:20,260
Here's one from Merit Polymer.

239
00:12:20,260 --> 00:12:20,660
Thanks, Merit.

240
00:12:20,660 --> 00:12:27,380
It's Yahoo Answers user, question mark, who asks, what problems do us farmers have?

241
00:12:28,420 --> 00:12:29,220
Right?

242
00:12:29,220 --> 00:12:30,820
It's confusing.

243
00:12:30,820 --> 00:12:31,460
A bit.

244
00:12:31,460 --> 00:12:36,340
Because you would think if it's us farmers, you would be familiar with the problems that

245
00:12:36,340 --> 00:12:38,980
you face in your chosen vocation.

246
00:12:40,020 --> 00:12:44,500
But maybe you live a sort of, you know, a semi-charm farm life, a semi-farm kind of

247
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:48,020
life and it's going all good.

248
00:12:48,020 --> 00:12:50,180
And so, but you want to be able to relate to the other farmers.

249
00:12:50,180 --> 00:12:54,660
You go to the farm bar and you say like, oh, how's it going?

250
00:12:54,660 --> 00:12:56,500
Everyone's like, oh, not good.

251
00:12:57,220 --> 00:12:57,460
Why?

252
00:12:57,940 --> 00:12:59,940
You know, bean bugs.

253
00:12:59,940 --> 00:13:02,100
Oh, no, you got the bean bugs again?

254
00:13:02,100 --> 00:13:06,100
Yeah, these little guys climb up all my stalks and they take the beans back to their village

255
00:13:06,100 --> 00:13:07,700
to, you know, worship it or whatever.

256
00:13:07,700 --> 00:13:09,140
And then I don't have that to sell.

257
00:13:09,140 --> 00:13:10,500
Griffin, can I ask you a question?

258
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:15,860
And I just want to clarify here because I have heard you on other podcasts talk about

259
00:13:15,860 --> 00:13:17,780
the magazine US Weekly.

260
00:13:17,780 --> 00:13:23,060
Is it possibly the question here is what issues do US farmers have?

261
00:13:23,780 --> 00:13:24,820
It's lowercase.

262
00:13:24,820 --> 00:13:26,660
Okay, we're probably good.

263
00:13:26,660 --> 00:13:27,160
Yeah.

264
00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:31,000
Yeah, what problems do us farmers have?

265
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,200
I mean, the usual.

266
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:37,800
That kind of sounds like a question someone trying to pretend to be a farmer in a farmer

267
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:39,080
bar would say, right?

268
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:43,160
Yeah, you guys know about the problems us farmers have, right?

269
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:48,120
Yeah, they went to the grocery store and they bought a ear of corn and then they, you know,

270
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:52,520
dug a little hole in their front yard and just laid the ear of corn gently down into

271
00:13:52,520 --> 00:13:55,080
it and they're like, well, I'm now in the farm life.

272
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:57,720
So now I need more things to complain about.

273
00:13:57,720 --> 00:13:58,200
What's that?

274
00:13:58,200 --> 00:13:58,920
Bean bugs?

275
00:13:58,920 --> 00:14:00,760
Yeah, I hate those fucking things.

276
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:02,120
I bet I've got them.

277
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:05,160
I bet I probably have worse bean bugs than you, bean farmer.

278
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:10,440
I mean, usual stuff, too, like economy is probably not, you know, great for them or

279
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:11,560
maybe it's very good.

280
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:14,280
Can't decide what to wear.

281
00:14:14,840 --> 00:14:19,400
Yeah, you know, some days you just go and stand in front of the mirror for 30 minutes

282
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:23,400
and it's like, these shorts look like shit and I have stains on everything because of

283
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:25,000
my rough farm life.

284
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,440
What am I going to wear today?

285
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:30,760
You know, and then you say, like, you know, I think I'm going to go with this black tea,

286
00:14:30,760 --> 00:14:35,320
but then you're out in the sun and the black tea gets so hot.

287
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:40,760
So you go back and you change into like a crisp white tea and that's pretty good.

288
00:14:40,760 --> 00:14:42,200
Don't get me wrong, it's great.

289
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:45,480
And it really shows off, I don't know, your muscles, probably.

290
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:52,680
You know, the cartoon farmer aesthetic is overalls no shirt and that's maybe the worst

291
00:14:52,680 --> 00:14:57,960
imaginable scenario because then you get the hot downtown and the burnt burnt topside.

292
00:14:58,680 --> 00:15:00,200
Is there anything worse than that?

293
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:01,800
I don't believe there is.

294
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:08,920
You could complain with them about the absolutely miserable web interface of farmersonly.com.

295
00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:15,640
Yeah, it is just unthinkable in 2018 that this would be how you interact with this website.

296
00:15:15,640 --> 00:15:20,200
And that could be one of the things you bring up is like the images never load.

297
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:26,200
Yeah, you could also like join them in a good round of complaining about how Farmville isn't

298
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:29,400
really representative of the kind of work you actually do.

299
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:31,720
So frustrating.

300
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:32,920
That's not how it works.

301
00:15:32,920 --> 00:15:34,680
I don't just like click it till it grows.

302
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:35,160
You know what?

303
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:37,560
I'm out there with my machines.

304
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:39,800
You do kind of click it till it grows though, right?

305
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:41,000
Yeah, it's kind of like that.

306
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:45,560
Is on FarmersOnly, I've never been on the website.

307
00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:47,800
There's a good reason.

308
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:50,440
Well, yeah, I'm married, but I don't hate farmers.

309
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:51,320
I don't want people to think that.

310
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:55,640
No, I said I wasn't going to say because you're married, though that is a very good reason.

311
00:15:55,640 --> 00:15:56,440
I mean, because you, Griffin...

312
00:15:56,440 --> 00:15:57,640
Oh, yeah, I'm not a farmer.

313
00:15:57,640 --> 00:15:58,600
I'm not a farmer.

314
00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:01,000
The name's right there.

315
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:08,520
Is there a heuristic, some sort of search filter you can apply to look at potential

316
00:16:08,520 --> 00:16:10,600
partners by their yield?

317
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:13,880
Because that seems like the one I want to go with.

318
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:22,120
I'm not as interested in interests or personality or looks or anything like that.

319
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:30,120
I just want to know what the raw tonnage of carrots was for your institution last year

320
00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:37,240
because I'm here bringing in the payloads of this soybean and I'm killing,

321
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:39,400
squashing bean bugs left and right, quick, quick, quick, quick, quick.

322
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:40,840
I got my son walking around.

323
00:16:40,840 --> 00:16:43,560
He's got his stomping boots on killing these nasty guys.

324
00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:47,240
And all my soybeans are coming in and I'm a top earner.

325
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:50,040
My DPS rankings are off the fucking charts.

326
00:16:50,040 --> 00:16:51,880
I can't be messing around with somebody who's like,

327
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:54,760
yeah, I brought in four buckets of carrots left.

328
00:16:54,760 --> 00:16:56,200
Four buckets?

329
00:16:56,200 --> 00:16:57,240
I can't love you.

330
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:03,720
I do want to, as I did sign up for Farmers Only because I thought I would have some good

331
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:05,960
stuff to kind of share with the show.

332
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:12,440
I will say this is an irritating thing about FarmersOnly.com is that there is no field

333
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:13,160
for yield.

334
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:14,680
There's no yield field, sadly.

335
00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:15,240
Damn it.

336
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:16,840
How could you get on there, Justin?

337
00:17:16,840 --> 00:17:20,200
What kind of lies did you have to perpetrate to get on Farmers Only?

338
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:21,000
I got in deep.

339
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,840
But here's the thing I want to share with you.

340
00:17:22,840 --> 00:17:24,440
There is no yield field.

341
00:17:24,440 --> 00:17:31,640
There is a field for profession, which like, I should hope I know the answer to that fucking

342
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:32,520
question.

343
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:34,600
I should hope that it's farmer.

344
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:37,080
I hope that you should say type of farmer.

345
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:37,580
I hope.

346
00:17:38,680 --> 00:17:40,040
Farmer specialization?

347
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:40,840
Yeah.

348
00:17:40,840 --> 00:17:43,400
What's your- what are you spec'd in for farming?

349
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:45,240
Are you dual wielding your field?

350
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:46,680
Dual fielding, if you will?

351
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:53,560
It also does have a place for your sign, which is not- I don't know why.

352
00:17:53,560 --> 00:17:56,040
I just did not expect that on FarmersOnly.com.

353
00:17:56,040 --> 00:17:57,000
He's a Virgo.

354
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,840
Don't touch his tomatoes.

355
00:17:58,840 --> 00:17:59,480
You know why.

356
00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:01,000
They're nasty.

357
00:18:01,560 --> 00:18:08,520
I think you should have to print your FarmersOnly.com profile on all goods that you sell.

358
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:16,600
I think that would be so great if I could buy a big vat of avocados and know sort of

359
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:20,280
like what they're looking for in a potential special partner.

360
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:23,800
That's a Scorpio's avocados right there.

361
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:25,480
Scorpio avocado's delicious.

362
00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:30,600
You think if they got their own dating website, I never thought about this before, probably

363
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:32,360
pretty tight-knit crew, right?

364
00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:33,160
Yep, yep.

365
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:39,160
Is- is there a secret farmers market after a sex party?

366
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:43,240
If there was that, they wouldn't need the website, is what I would suggest.

367
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:45,800
Oh, they want to so bad.

368
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:46,680
They want to so bad.

369
00:18:46,680 --> 00:18:54,520
They see my rutabaga, I see, you know, their- their onions, and I'm like, oh my god, I'm

370
00:18:54,520 --> 00:18:57,240
feeling it so hard and they're craving my wave.

371
00:18:57,240 --> 00:19:02,200
Anytime that you leave a farmers market and there's nobody there, like when it's abandoned

372
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:07,480
and it's rare, so like you could never see it by definition, but anytime that there are

373
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:13,000
no customers at a farmers market, every single stall is just shouting back and forth to each

374
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:17,640
other like, are you all like crazy horny?

375
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:21,400
And they will all say like, yes, we're all extremely horny.

376
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:21,880
If only-

377
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:23,800
I wish we didn't have to sell this veg.

378
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:24,280
Yeah.

379
00:19:24,280 --> 00:19:28,760
I'm very worried because Griffin, because as you pointed out, the farmers are very tight-knit

380
00:19:28,760 --> 00:19:32,920
and I'm worried that they will know that Justin is not a farmer, but he has signed on to their

381
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:38,040
website and they're going to come for him and I'm worried about my brother.

382
00:19:38,040 --> 00:19:40,600
Oh, he's going to get run over by a big tractor.

383
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:43,960
Justin, I think you're going to need to start farming right now.

384
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:45,400
Yeah, like right now, bud.

385
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:46,440
All right, good luck.

386
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:51,480
There's no, like unless they're like pinging my IP address, I don't think they're going

387
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:51,800
to track me.

388
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:53,400
What if they're listening right now?

389
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:57,720
You guys think there's a bumper sticker that says, farmers don't make love, they plow?

390
00:19:57,720 --> 00:20:03,960
Oh no, for sure there is.

391
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:09,480
I'm going to, if not, mackleroymerch.com, just go get that.

392
00:20:10,920 --> 00:20:13,160
I want to ask you guys another question.

393
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:17,800
For about a year now, I've been collecting screenshots of men on Tinder or OkCupid,

394
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:21,480
holy up a fish, lobster and crab in their profile pictures.

395
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:23,400
I have nearly 150 now.

396
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:24,360
Oh my God.

397
00:20:24,360 --> 00:20:25,400
What should I do with them?

398
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:27,480
And why do men think this is attractive?

399
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:30,360
That's from Hook, Line and Tinder in Nova Scotia.

400
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:37,160
I mean, the obvious thing, and this is, I mean, there are some very old, I guess,

401
00:20:37,160 --> 00:20:41,560
preconceived notions that the man should be the provider.

402
00:20:41,560 --> 00:20:50,520
And maybe he is trying to display his skills at providing sustenance.

403
00:20:50,520 --> 00:20:53,560
This is the protein I could provide for you.

404
00:20:53,560 --> 00:20:57,560
This is the protein that I'm bringing to the relationship.

405
00:20:57,560 --> 00:21:01,240
The question asker has provided a screenshot.

406
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:04,280
I can't stop, it's really good.

407
00:21:04,280 --> 00:21:07,320
There's something, there's two curious things.

408
00:21:07,320 --> 00:21:11,960
One, all these boys are so proud of these things they killed in the water.

409
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:14,120
And that's great to me, good job, boys.

410
00:21:14,120 --> 00:21:18,120
You got really rowdy under the sea and you just really got those guys.

411
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:22,600
Here's the other thing, and stop me if I'm way off base here,

412
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:24,920
but I'm looking, there is a lot of lobsters.

413
00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:27,400
And a lot of these lobsters are really huge.

414
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:33,480
I'm saying of this 20 image chunk they sent over, good 11 of them are lobsters.

415
00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:38,280
And boys, I swear to God, the same lobsters in a lot of these pictures.

416
00:21:40,840 --> 00:21:42,280
I don't know what the answer is there.

417
00:21:42,280 --> 00:21:44,840
Maybe a few of these boys went on the same fishing trip.

418
00:21:44,840 --> 00:21:46,360
They caught a lobster and they're like, all right,

419
00:21:46,360 --> 00:21:49,560
let's all take pictures of it and put it up on our dating profile.

420
00:21:49,560 --> 00:21:51,000
And that would explain it.

421
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:57,800
Maybe there's just one weird sort of rental lobster pickup service

422
00:21:57,800 --> 00:22:01,160
where you go and you get the big lobster and you take a picture with it.

423
00:22:01,160 --> 00:22:05,080
They make it look professional, make it look like you did just kill it in the ocean.

424
00:22:05,080 --> 00:22:08,520
And then you bring it right back and you give them their $40 or whatever.

425
00:22:08,520 --> 00:22:11,800
Is it the lobster maybe who's renting himself out?

426
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:13,880
Like, yeah, I'll make you look real nice.

427
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:14,680
Come on in.

428
00:22:14,680 --> 00:22:16,280
All right, boys, what are we doing?

429
00:22:16,280 --> 00:22:16,840
What do we got?

430
00:22:16,840 --> 00:22:18,280
We got profile pictures.

431
00:22:18,280 --> 00:22:18,840
Okay, good.

432
00:22:18,840 --> 00:22:22,200
Go ahead and put a strap on my claw.

433
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:23,640
I let you pick the color.

434
00:22:24,680 --> 00:22:25,640
That's fine.

435
00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:26,520
Okay, that's good.

436
00:22:26,520 --> 00:22:29,560
Now just scoot me up and you get three shots.

437
00:22:29,560 --> 00:22:32,120
So make them good, okay?

438
00:22:32,120 --> 00:22:34,280
You want to put on the overalls?

439
00:22:34,280 --> 00:22:34,840
You don't have to.

440
00:22:34,840 --> 00:22:35,560
Make sure you...

441
00:22:36,360 --> 00:22:37,160
Let me turn on.

442
00:22:37,160 --> 00:22:42,440
I got a green screen background of a rain-slicked day in St. John's.

443
00:22:42,440 --> 00:22:42,920
Hold on.

444
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:44,760
All right, good.

445
00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:47,240
Is that really the face you're gonna fucking make, pal?

446
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:53,080
Because let me spritz the camera a little bit and make the lens look like it's raining on there.

447
00:22:53,080 --> 00:23:01,880
Listen, some fellas find it helps if they imagine the process of obtaining me from the sea.

448
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:03,560
So maybe you want to give that a whirl.

449
00:23:03,560 --> 00:23:05,480
I'll give you a second in private.

450
00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:06,600
I can't be in here.

451
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:08,200
I'll fucking puke.

452
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:12,920
But go ahead and just get yourself ready and then we'll just do this thing, okay?

453
00:23:12,920 --> 00:23:17,800
I also really like the dude in the top left who has the lobster like it's a parrot on his shoulder.

454
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:19,080
Yeah, he's got a friend here.

455
00:23:19,080 --> 00:23:21,960
Because it fucking reminds me of Muppet's Treasure Island.

456
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:24,520
All the other ones are like, I just caught this.

457
00:23:24,520 --> 00:23:26,920
That picture might be like, this lobster?

458
00:23:26,920 --> 00:23:28,840
I've had this lobster since I was a baby.

459
00:23:28,840 --> 00:23:29,720
This is my cousin.

460
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:35,160
I'm just now noticing that he's a lobster.

461
00:23:35,160 --> 00:23:36,840
Thank you for pointing that out, actually.

462
00:23:36,840 --> 00:23:40,440
A bunch of the boys are making sort of a duck mouth face

463
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:45,480
to sort of let you know that they're, you know, bad boys.

464
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:51,320
Unless what they're actually doing is doing a pantomime kiss to let you know,

465
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:54,840
this is the kind of stuff I can haul out of the ocean.

466
00:23:54,840 --> 00:23:57,560
And this is what I'll look like when I'm kissing you because of it.

467
00:23:58,280 --> 00:24:04,200
Which I think is like a really concise sales pitch to be contained inside of a single JPEG.

468
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:05,000
Like you can do...

469
00:24:05,960 --> 00:24:07,320
What was the question though?

470
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:08,200
What was the question?

471
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:09,400
What am I going to do with this?

472
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:11,320
What should I do with them? You can't do anything with them.

473
00:24:11,320 --> 00:24:12,200
Like now you can't.

474
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:12,600
You gotta...

475
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:13,880
This is your secret collection.

476
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:17,560
You can't like make this a public thing.

477
00:24:17,560 --> 00:24:18,200
You don't want to...

478
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:18,840
Because you know what?

479
00:24:18,840 --> 00:24:22,920
The thing about it is I'm not sure I would notice individually.

480
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:28,040
It only becomes notable as a collective, right?

481
00:24:28,040 --> 00:24:33,800
Like you don't think about it until you see a lot of them back on the next to each other.

482
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:37,720
You really need the full like a wall of pictures in front of you before you're like,

483
00:24:37,720 --> 00:24:40,360
wait a minute and then you can Kaiser Sose it all together.

484
00:24:40,360 --> 00:24:41,000
Yeah.

485
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:47,240
It's been the same lobster the entire time.

486
00:24:47,240 --> 00:24:48,760
Here's what I would do if I were you.

487
00:24:48,760 --> 00:24:54,360
I would also start collecting photos of men on dating websites posing with dogs

488
00:24:54,360 --> 00:24:58,840
and then try to find men from lobster and dog photos who look similar

489
00:24:58,840 --> 00:25:03,000
and try to construct the narrative where the person's dog was cursed and turned into a lobster.

490
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:03,640
Yes, that's good.

491
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:05,320
And you can like write a book about it.

492
00:25:05,320 --> 00:25:07,160
Or lobster to dog.

493
00:25:07,160 --> 00:25:10,200
It's up to you which direction you want to go.

494
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:11,880
Just for the facial hair.

495
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:15,560
You could elevate this I think if you were one of these very proud boys

496
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:20,200
and have one image of you with the big lobster that you definitely caught.

497
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:22,600
And the second image is you with that.

498
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:24,680
And this is what would entice me.

499
00:25:24,680 --> 00:25:28,360
You with that lobster cooked, butter poached, delicious looking.

500
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:31,800
Also, they're holding up today's newspaper to let you know, come and get it.

501
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:35,560
Do they ever do this on the dating websites where they're like,

502
00:25:35,560 --> 00:25:38,440
they show you a big crock pot full of stew

503
00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:45,640
and then they're holding today's newspaper to let you know, act fast, first come first serve.

504
00:25:45,640 --> 00:25:52,280
I think you should have, there should be a special indicator on every dating profile.

505
00:25:52,280 --> 00:25:54,760
And it's either if it's red, that means nothing.

506
00:25:54,760 --> 00:25:58,600
If it means, if there's a green light, it means, hey, I've got a stew on right now.

507
00:25:58,600 --> 00:26:00,120
Right this second.

508
00:26:00,120 --> 00:26:02,680
Right, you can include it in the bio,

509
00:26:02,680 --> 00:26:06,360
but you're going to be doing a lot of updates just like one day later.

510
00:26:06,360 --> 00:26:09,080
Just like, sorry ladies, no stew today.

511
00:26:09,800 --> 00:26:10,840
I got busy.

512
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:13,720
I got busy.

513
00:26:13,720 --> 00:26:16,200
I had sex last night because of the stew.

514
00:26:16,840 --> 00:26:18,120
So I'm good for a little bit.

515
00:26:18,120 --> 00:26:20,360
You don't want me to rush it.

516
00:26:20,360 --> 00:26:21,000
Yeah.

517
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:25,160
I'll put a gumbo on tomorrow and we'll go ahead and just flip.

518
00:26:25,160 --> 00:26:25,880
Watch this face.

519
00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:27,560
We'll do a slow crock pot.

520
00:26:27,560 --> 00:26:31,080
That'll give me at least, if I started at noon on Tuesday,

521
00:26:31,080 --> 00:26:35,240
it'll give me until, I don't know, probably 8pm Wednesday.

522
00:26:35,240 --> 00:26:37,240
So anywhere in there that you want to come over.

523
00:26:39,800 --> 00:26:42,040
If you agree to date me right now,

524
00:26:42,040 --> 00:26:46,760
I have three fourths of a German chocolate cake that my mom made and she left it here.

525
00:26:47,320 --> 00:26:52,520
If you agree to be my girlfriend now, you could have some of this cake.

526
00:26:52,520 --> 00:26:57,000
Our first date will include some of this cake that my mom made me and left at my apartment.

527
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:01,320
I will save some for you, but I get the last piece because my mommy made it.

528
00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:01,560
Yep.

529
00:27:02,360 --> 00:27:06,120
See, if this were me, I would have four pictures as my dating profile.

530
00:27:06,120 --> 00:27:08,280
Picture one, holding up the lobster.

531
00:27:08,280 --> 00:27:09,080
Got to, got to, got to.

532
00:27:09,080 --> 00:27:10,360
I just caught it.

533
00:27:10,360 --> 00:27:14,040
Picture two, me holding the lobster over a pot of boiling water.

534
00:27:14,680 --> 00:27:18,360
And making a face like, here comes the cook.

535
00:27:18,360 --> 00:27:19,000
Here it goes.

536
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:22,840
But then photo three, now I'm hugging the lobster.

537
00:27:22,840 --> 00:27:25,560
Picture four, I'm watching with tears in my eyes

538
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:28,520
as that lobster graduates from college with honors.

539
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:33,000
And then he's holding a lobster.

540
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:36,280
Yeah, that's your son.

541
00:27:36,280 --> 00:27:37,720
He's holding your son.

542
00:27:37,720 --> 00:27:46,680
Now, if your picture was a giant lobster holding a tiny man with his hands rubber banded together,

543
00:27:47,240 --> 00:27:48,600
that's a profile picture.

544
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:50,600
I want to get to know that crustacean.

545
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:54,360
Yeah, and the big lobster be holding today's newspaper trying to attract the lady lobster.

546
00:27:54,360 --> 00:27:58,760
She was like, do they eat people?

547
00:27:58,760 --> 00:28:01,480
Oh yeah, if they're big enough, for sure, for sure.

548
00:28:01,480 --> 00:28:02,920
Yeah, they would, for sure.

549
00:28:02,920 --> 00:28:03,640
Asked and answered.

550
00:28:04,680 --> 00:28:09,240
Let's take a quick break and we're going to head on over to the Money Zone.

551
00:28:19,880 --> 00:28:22,200
Can I tell you all about Stitch Fix?

552
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:23,240
I wish you would.

553
00:28:23,240 --> 00:28:29,400
Stitch Fix has helped me, and this is no joke, revolutionize my wardrobe.

554
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:33,160
Here's the thing I've never had before that Stitch Fix has helped me with.

555
00:28:33,160 --> 00:28:39,880
I've got clothes that are like my winter clothes and now like my spring and summer clothes.

556
00:28:39,880 --> 00:28:46,440
I would say that if you have ever seen a picture from, I would say September 2017 on,

557
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:49,480
of like I was performing at a live show and you've thought,

558
00:28:49,480 --> 00:28:53,960
oh, I really like Travis's shirt there, 90% chance that's from Stitch Fix.

559
00:28:53,960 --> 00:28:59,480
Yeah, when we are on the road, we're always comparing like, hey, where is that from?

560
00:28:59,480 --> 00:29:00,440
Oh yeah, Stitch Fix.

561
00:29:00,440 --> 00:29:01,000
Yeah, me too.

562
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:02,120
This is from Stitch Fix.

563
00:29:02,120 --> 00:29:03,240
And it's not just shirts.

564
00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:07,640
Like I get pants, shirts, socks, shoes, jackets.

565
00:29:07,640 --> 00:29:09,960
Like they'll put together whole outfits for you.

566
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:14,840
And one of my favorite things that they do is they send you a card along with all the

567
00:29:14,840 --> 00:29:19,640
clothes that shows what would go with what, what you could add to stuff that's in the box

568
00:29:19,640 --> 00:29:21,080
to make an outfit.

569
00:29:21,080 --> 00:29:24,920
And like, they give you suggestions of like, it would, you could wear it for this.

570
00:29:24,920 --> 00:29:26,600
And like, it would work with this.

571
00:29:26,600 --> 00:29:28,840
And you have a stylist that you can talk to.

572
00:29:28,840 --> 00:29:32,760
And like, when you send stuff back, you say like, I really love this.

573
00:29:33,960 --> 00:29:35,080
This was okay.

574
00:29:35,080 --> 00:29:35,800
I didn't like this.

575
00:29:35,800 --> 00:29:37,480
You return the stuff you don't want to wear.

576
00:29:38,360 --> 00:29:42,920
And that helps them update their profile for you of your style.

577
00:29:42,920 --> 00:29:48,360
And like, every time it's a better and better fit for both like, how it fits, but also like,

578
00:29:48,360 --> 00:29:48,920
your style.

579
00:29:48,920 --> 00:29:49,560
It's great.

580
00:29:49,560 --> 00:29:52,760
And it's free to ship the stuff back and to get it.

581
00:29:52,760 --> 00:29:55,880
So go to stitchfix.com slash my brother.

582
00:29:55,880 --> 00:29:56,680
Get started now.

Stitchfix.com slash my brother.

586
00:30:04,040 --> 00:30:06,200
I want to tell y'all about Wink.

587
00:30:07,160 --> 00:30:08,840
Do you like Wink?

588
00:30:08,840 --> 00:30:15,880
You like wine, but I went to go buy wine for my Eurovision party and I look at the wine

589
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:18,200
and my mind just melts.

590
00:30:18,920 --> 00:30:20,680
I can't make any heads or tails of it.

591
00:30:20,680 --> 00:30:24,120
Some are red, some are white, some are pink, some are blue.

592
00:30:24,120 --> 00:30:26,520
Don't get that one unless you should.

593
00:30:26,520 --> 00:30:27,720
And that's a very rare one.

594
00:30:27,720 --> 00:30:29,240
I don't actually have the answers.

595
00:30:29,240 --> 00:30:29,960
But you know who does?

596
00:30:29,960 --> 00:30:30,920
It's Wink.

597
00:30:30,920 --> 00:30:35,640
Wink makes it easy to discover great wines personalized for you starting at just $13 a

598
00:30:35,640 --> 00:30:35,960
bottle.

599
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:37,640
You fill out this quiz.

600
00:30:37,640 --> 00:30:38,600
It's fun.

601
00:30:38,600 --> 00:30:44,040
You tell it what kind of foods you like, what kind of palette you have and then it will

602
00:30:44,040 --> 00:30:45,560
suggest some wines for you.

603
00:30:45,560 --> 00:30:46,600
There's no membership fees.

604
00:30:46,600 --> 00:30:47,480
You can skip any month.

605
00:30:47,480 --> 00:30:48,760
You can cancel any time.

606
00:30:48,760 --> 00:30:53,160
They cover the shipping and if you don't like a bottle, they'll replace it.

607
00:30:53,960 --> 00:30:55,080
No questions asked.

608
00:30:55,080 --> 00:30:57,800
So discover great wine today.

609
00:30:57,800 --> 00:31:00,600
Go to trywink.com slash my brother.

610
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:03,240
You'll get $20 off your first shipment.

611
00:31:03,240 --> 00:31:10,120
That's trywink, T-R-Y-W-I-N-C dot com slash my brother.

612
00:31:10,120 --> 00:31:11,960
You get $20 off.

613
00:31:11,960 --> 00:31:17,640
That's trywink.com slash my brother.

614
00:31:17,640 --> 00:31:22,680
I'm really glad there's no questions asked because sometimes I have some really shady

615
00:31:22,680 --> 00:31:24,600
reasons that I don't like a bottle of wine.

616
00:31:25,320 --> 00:31:32,920
It's also worth noting that our exclusive URL trystink.com does work if you don't want

617
00:31:32,920 --> 00:31:34,680
to use that URL.

618
00:31:34,680 --> 00:31:37,800
You can use the URL trystink with a K.

619
00:31:37,800 --> 00:31:41,160
When did we pick that one up, Juicer?

620
00:31:41,160 --> 00:31:42,680
I don't know when we got trystink.

621
00:31:42,680 --> 00:31:43,880
Because it's insulted.

622
00:31:43,880 --> 00:31:49,560
It's a weird dig at the sponsor so it's kind of a weird choice you made.

623
00:31:49,560 --> 00:31:51,000
It's not really.

624
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:53,240
I don't know how we got that one.

625
00:31:53,240 --> 00:32:00,360
You would probably be better off using trywink W-I-N-C dot com slash my brother.

626
00:32:00,360 --> 00:32:05,880
If you find that hard to remember, I'm sure that Wink would prefer you just take advantage

627
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:09,240
of their services no matter what fucking URL you have.

628
00:32:09,240 --> 00:32:10,440
That's true, Juicer.

629
00:32:10,440 --> 00:32:11,960
I don't know, Justin.

630
00:32:11,960 --> 00:32:16,040
I'd be worried that they would know somehow and I would get my first shipment of wine,

631
00:32:16,040 --> 00:32:19,400
but also a note that's like, did we do something to upset you?

632
00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:25,000
The emails that we get this week will tell the tale of how Wink feels about their URL

633
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:26,760
being manhandled like this.

634
00:32:26,760 --> 00:32:30,920
I want to tell you all about Dungeons and Hangovers and Orcs, Orcs, Orcs.

635
00:32:30,920 --> 00:32:32,280
It's two things.

636
00:32:32,280 --> 00:32:35,720
Let me start doing it right now.

637
00:32:35,720 --> 00:32:40,600
Dungeons and Hangovers purveys fun, original D&D adventure modules to the discerning gamer.

638
00:32:40,600 --> 00:32:46,360
Our publications include The Unquiet, a cozy autumnal adventure inspired by Hana Dollwatch

639
00:32:46,360 --> 00:32:53,080
and Snow Daemon, a tale of Krampus set in a magical mountain village where it's always

640
00:32:53,080 --> 00:32:54,680
winter but never candle nights.

641
00:32:54,680 --> 00:32:59,720
This spring, we're releasing our first Dungeons and Hangovers triple shot, a three-pack of

642
00:32:59,720 --> 00:33:05,080
short, chuckle-fest adventures playtested at Orcs, Orcs, Orcs, our tavern pop-up in

643
00:33:05,080 --> 00:33:06,600
Portland, Oregon.

644
00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:08,280
That all sounds extremely good.

645
00:33:08,280 --> 00:33:11,160
If I lived in Portland, you know I'd be hitting up Orcs, Orcs, Orcs.

646
00:33:11,160 --> 00:33:15,880
I don't still know what a pop-up is, although they say that word a lot on like Top Chef

647
00:33:15,880 --> 00:33:20,920
and I'm like, is it a restaurant that you pull both sides of and it inflates?

648
00:33:20,920 --> 00:33:22,760
And I think the answer is yeah, probably.

649
00:33:22,760 --> 00:33:29,400
But visit DungeonsandHangovers.com slash WhereIsWizardHut for an adventure pandering exclusively

650
00:33:29,400 --> 00:33:30,600
to Mbem Bambinos.

651
00:33:30,600 --> 00:33:33,800
Portland folks, come hang out at Orcs, Orcs, Orcs.

652
00:33:33,800 --> 00:33:34,920
I got a message.

653
00:33:34,920 --> 00:33:35,880
It's for Chloe.

654
00:33:35,880 --> 00:33:37,480
It's for Ian and Sarah.

655
00:33:37,480 --> 00:33:41,960
And it's for Joanna and the super secret friend zone.

656
00:33:41,960 --> 00:33:43,400
And it's from Sean.

657
00:33:43,400 --> 00:33:45,400
It says, I love you all.

658
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:50,760
I cherish the time we spend playing games, talking about anime or the latest Taz, or

659
00:33:50,760 --> 00:33:52,920
teasing Ian with puns.

660
00:33:52,920 --> 00:33:59,240
After Bone Folder, Chloe's rise to fame at Boston Mbem Bamb, that's her Mbem Bamb show

661
00:33:59,240 --> 00:34:05,080
there, I decided to immortalize us all via JTron, which is a fun slang.

662
00:34:05,080 --> 00:34:10,680
For JonTron, everyone's favorite disgraced video game streamer.

663
00:34:10,680 --> 00:34:14,840
Congrats on upcoming weddings for Chloe and Ian and Derek and Anna.

664
00:34:14,840 --> 00:34:16,600
That's going to be one hell of a wedding.

665
00:34:16,600 --> 00:34:17,640
Got to get to that event.

666
00:34:17,640 --> 00:34:23,800
To my friends and the McElroys all, thank you, keep on boning down hard.

667
00:34:23,800 --> 00:34:24,760
Okay.

668
00:34:24,760 --> 00:34:25,560
All right.

669
00:34:25,560 --> 00:34:27,480
All right.

670
00:34:27,480 --> 00:34:33,240
Not usually how this arrangement works is I get sort of sexual encouragement from the

671
00:34:33,240 --> 00:34:34,360
listeners of this show.

672
00:34:34,360 --> 00:34:39,880
Usually it's we make a horse joke here, a ghost joke here, and you send an email in.

673
00:34:39,880 --> 00:34:41,560
It's like, that's great.

674
00:34:41,560 --> 00:34:46,440
I don't even know that I want more of that.

675
00:34:46,440 --> 00:34:49,640
That's weird.

676
00:34:49,640 --> 00:34:54,440
I don't even know that I enjoy that sensation of that.

677
00:34:54,440 --> 00:34:54,940
Cool.

678
00:34:56,040 --> 00:34:57,800
Trav, you want to read this last Jumbotron?

679
00:34:57,800 --> 00:34:58,300
Yeah.

680
00:34:58,760 --> 00:35:04,520
This is from Rocket Ship and from, no, for Smelly It.

681
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:06,120
All right.

682
00:35:06,120 --> 00:35:08,840
Happy birthday, old Ramble Gamble.

683
00:35:08,840 --> 00:35:11,160
Now, why didn't we go with that nickname?

684
00:35:11,160 --> 00:35:14,360
Why did we start with Smelly It and work our way to Ramble Gamble?

685
00:35:14,360 --> 00:35:15,000
Okay.

686
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:17,160
Thanks for goofing and aloofing with me.

687
00:35:20,200 --> 00:35:21,240
You all.

688
00:35:21,240 --> 00:35:23,000
And here's to many years more.

689
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:27,800
Thanks for being the best bestie, a strong independent woman who don't need no man could

690
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:28,440
have.

691
00:35:28,440 --> 00:35:30,760
The best thing here is the preferred time frame.

692
00:35:30,760 --> 00:35:32,600
Yes, I see you've just gotten there.

693
00:35:32,600 --> 00:35:33,720
I just hit it.

694
00:35:33,720 --> 00:35:38,760
The preferred time frame is read this anytime I don't actually know when his birthday is.

695
00:35:39,960 --> 00:35:43,960
That's somebody, because the Jumbotrons are in demand now, I think we had a lot of people

696
00:35:43,960 --> 00:35:47,000
that were just kind of like blasting through.

697
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:47,960
Hip firing.

698
00:35:47,960 --> 00:35:48,280
Sure.

699
00:35:48,280 --> 00:35:50,120
It's just like, it's hype anything.

700
00:35:51,880 --> 00:35:52,440
Hi, everybody.

701
00:35:52,440 --> 00:35:53,400
I'm Justin McElroy.

702
00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:54,840
And I'm Dr. Sydney McElroy.

703
00:35:54,840 --> 00:35:59,240
Every week, we release a medical history podcast called Sawbones.

704
00:35:59,240 --> 00:36:04,040
We go over the history of the dumbest, grossest, weirdest stuff humans have been doing to each

705
00:36:04,040 --> 00:36:05,800
other since the dawn of mankind.

706
00:36:05,800 --> 00:36:07,400
But it's a funny show.

707
00:36:07,400 --> 00:36:12,680
But it's also so disgusting and stomach turning, you won't believe it.

708
00:36:12,680 --> 00:36:15,320
But it's also like funny.

709
00:36:15,320 --> 00:36:16,040
It's funny.

710
00:36:16,040 --> 00:36:21,160
It is the wildest, grossest, nastiest stuff you can imagine.

711
00:36:21,160 --> 00:36:22,120
It's a real hoot.

712
00:36:22,120 --> 00:36:23,160
It's called Sawbones.

713
00:36:23,160 --> 00:36:29,080
And we release it every week on iTunes, wherever podcasts are sold, and right here on maximumfun.org.

714
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:32,360
How about Yahoo?

715
00:36:32,360 --> 00:36:33,320
I love that, Griffin.

716
00:36:33,320 --> 00:36:34,040
Thank you.

717
00:36:34,040 --> 00:36:35,240
You ran my mind.

718
00:36:35,240 --> 00:36:36,040
Yeah, sure.

719
00:36:36,040 --> 00:36:38,120
This one is sent by a couple folks.

720
00:36:38,120 --> 00:36:38,600
Thank you.

721
00:36:38,600 --> 00:36:41,800
It's Yahoo Answers user bad guy who asks.

722
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:43,400
I'm going to stand.

723
00:36:43,400 --> 00:36:44,280
Oh.

724
00:36:44,280 --> 00:36:45,960
Should I lift up my standing desk?

725
00:36:45,960 --> 00:36:46,760
Should I stand?

726
00:36:47,320 --> 00:36:48,920
I feel like I just wanted to stand.

727
00:36:48,920 --> 00:36:49,720
Okay, let's try it.

728
00:36:49,720 --> 00:36:50,280
I'm going to stand.

729
00:36:50,280 --> 00:36:51,400
So I'm just going to stand.

730
00:36:51,400 --> 00:36:55,080
I will extend the arm of my microphone stand.

731
00:36:55,080 --> 00:36:56,120
It's still going up.

732
00:36:56,120 --> 00:37:00,120
One of the things about stand up is you want to be standing up.

733
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:02,360
No, that's not from Steve.

734
00:37:02,360 --> 00:37:03,320
That one's from me.

735
00:37:04,040 --> 00:37:05,160
But you could use it.

736
00:37:05,160 --> 00:37:06,840
I feel like I'm going to yell now.

737
00:37:06,840 --> 00:37:07,960
Get the energy flowing.

738
00:37:07,960 --> 00:37:08,520
All right, here we go.

739
00:37:08,520 --> 00:37:09,720
Let's go, Yahoo.

740
00:37:09,720 --> 00:37:13,880
Yeah, bad guy asks, when feeling the heat,

741
00:37:13,880 --> 00:37:17,320
do you usually bail out or stay for the action?

742
00:37:17,320 --> 00:37:18,280
Oh, boy.

743
00:37:18,280 --> 00:37:19,880
So glad I stood for this.

744
00:37:19,880 --> 00:37:21,880
Yeah, this is a thinker regardless.

745
00:37:21,880 --> 00:37:24,200
This one's worth the effort.

746
00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:28,440
So I've been told before, like the, you know, the kitchen,

747
00:37:28,440 --> 00:37:30,120
that the kitchen is hot.

748
00:37:30,120 --> 00:37:31,640
Yeah, but I don't like that.

749
00:37:31,640 --> 00:37:33,320
I should go to the living room.

750
00:37:33,320 --> 00:37:36,840
Yeah, that's what they say when they're trying to get you psyched up for fucking sports.

751
00:37:36,840 --> 00:37:38,600
When it gets difficult, for sure.

752
00:37:38,600 --> 00:37:42,200
And it's like, if you don't like the kitchen because of the temperature,

753
00:37:42,200 --> 00:37:45,080
feel free to sit in the living room, coward.

754
00:37:45,080 --> 00:37:47,400
Yeah, I would rather be doing that though.

755
00:37:47,400 --> 00:37:49,000
That's like where all my devices are.

756
00:37:49,560 --> 00:37:53,080
Sometimes I'm at a party and I see two people starting to fight.

757
00:37:53,720 --> 00:37:55,400
And I think I better start it.

758
00:37:55,400 --> 00:37:58,520
But I learned something from my friend Charles Groton.

759
00:37:58,520 --> 00:38:02,840
He said, we can't possibly keep doing the Steve Martin.

760
00:38:02,840 --> 00:38:05,560
We cannot possibly keep doing the Steve Martin.

761
00:38:05,560 --> 00:38:10,120
He has been doing it for 40 years and look where it's gotten him.

762
00:38:10,120 --> 00:38:11,480
I'm so psyched, boys.

763
00:38:11,480 --> 00:38:14,200
Because this may surprise you to learn.

764
00:38:14,200 --> 00:38:18,120
Really, really good answers from Yahoo Answers users on this one.

765
00:38:18,120 --> 00:38:19,160
It does surprise me.

766
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:23,720
Best answer, little big man says, I stay for the action, my friend.

767
00:38:23,720 --> 00:38:25,480
Asker gave that one five stars.

768
00:38:25,480 --> 00:38:27,480
So that's the best answer, all of them.

769
00:38:27,480 --> 00:38:28,760
I agree to disagree.

770
00:38:29,640 --> 00:38:30,680
How is it the best answer?

771
00:38:30,680 --> 00:38:33,320
They chose one of the two binary options.

772
00:38:33,320 --> 00:38:38,920
They included the phrase, my friend, Justin, which is like, oh, we just made a connection.

773
00:38:38,920 --> 00:38:39,560
Five stars.

774
00:38:40,120 --> 00:38:41,800
Like the most interesting man in the world, right?

775
00:38:41,800 --> 00:38:42,920
I love his shit.

776
00:38:42,920 --> 00:38:47,640
How about this one from Rick29148 who says, not me, baby.

777
00:38:47,640 --> 00:38:48,520
I'm out of here.

778
00:38:51,800 --> 00:38:52,520
Not me, baby.

779
00:38:52,520 --> 00:38:53,560
I'm out of here.

780
00:38:53,560 --> 00:38:54,760
Not for the Rick.

781
00:38:54,760 --> 00:38:59,640
I stayed a year ago and burned my toes so badly, they actually brought in a surgeon

782
00:38:59,640 --> 00:39:01,480
to make sure they were worth saving.

783
00:39:01,480 --> 00:39:03,640
Took a year, but nine of them are okay.

784
00:39:03,640 --> 00:39:06,280
One of them still giving me troubles.

785
00:39:06,280 --> 00:39:07,080
Wait, what?

786
00:39:07,640 --> 00:39:10,600
How did this become a real world scenario for Rick?

787
00:39:10,600 --> 00:39:11,640
Just had some fun.

788
00:39:11,640 --> 00:39:12,920
Rick just had some fun.

789
00:39:12,920 --> 00:39:14,440
Hey, Griffin, have you ever looked at Yahoo?

790
00:39:15,320 --> 00:39:19,320
Does the original question asker pick the best answer?

791
00:39:19,320 --> 00:39:19,960
Is that something?

792
00:39:20,520 --> 00:39:21,560
Okay, why?

793
00:39:22,600 --> 00:39:31,400
What makes the question asker qualified to decide who is most correct about their question?

794
00:39:31,400 --> 00:39:34,760
It seems like by definition, they know the least about it, right?

795
00:39:34,760 --> 00:39:35,240
Yeah, that's fair.

796
00:39:35,240 --> 00:39:38,200
So like, how do they have any insight into whether or not you should leave your-

797
00:39:39,160 --> 00:39:43,960
Sounds like it's getting pretty hot in here, Justin, with all your questions.

798
00:39:44,760 --> 00:39:45,880
Travis, where are you going?

799
00:39:46,680 --> 00:39:48,040
Come back.

800
00:39:48,040 --> 00:39:50,040
No, I don't want to do the show anymore.

801
00:39:50,040 --> 00:39:51,400
It's too hot in here.

802
00:39:51,400 --> 00:39:53,160
Yeah, it's pretty hot.

803
00:39:53,160 --> 00:39:59,000
I'm staying even though these piggies are sizzling, but I'm gonna stay and keep reading

804
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:00,520
bad things people said online.

805
00:40:00,520 --> 00:40:03,800
Like Cab, who says, I'm bringing the gasoline.

806
00:40:03,800 --> 00:40:05,400
Fuck yeah, dude.

807
00:40:05,400 --> 00:40:06,600
Yeah, Cab.

808
00:40:06,600 --> 00:40:07,720
Yeah, Cab.

809
00:40:07,720 --> 00:40:12,840
This is a dookie website with a bullshit question with a question that didn't mean anything

810
00:40:12,840 --> 00:40:14,760
and an answer that was garbage.

811
00:40:14,760 --> 00:40:16,200
Fuck yeah, dude.

812
00:40:16,200 --> 00:40:16,700
Get it.

813
00:40:18,200 --> 00:40:19,400
Me, motherfucker?

814
00:40:20,120 --> 00:40:21,480
I'm gonna spice it up.

815
00:40:21,480 --> 00:40:23,960
I'm gonna spice it up Cab style, baby.

816
00:40:23,960 --> 00:40:25,800
God, no, it's too hot again.

817
00:40:26,840 --> 00:40:27,720
Travis is out.

818
00:40:27,720 --> 00:40:28,680
Got too hot.

819
00:40:28,680 --> 00:40:29,880
I told him it was cool.

820
00:40:29,880 --> 00:40:35,480
Pour a little Cabernet Sauvignon on this, which is my way of saying I'm gonna heat it up.

821
00:40:35,480 --> 00:40:36,920
Hey, let's hit you with this one.

822
00:40:36,920 --> 00:40:38,840
Question mark says, turn on the AC.

823
00:40:38,840 --> 00:40:41,160
Anonymous says, turn on the AC.

824
00:40:42,200 --> 00:40:45,160
So got a couple little double down on that one.

825
00:40:45,160 --> 00:40:49,320
I wish the other one would be turn on the AC DC and kind of just crank it up.

826
00:40:49,880 --> 00:40:50,600
Thunderstruck.

827
00:40:50,600 --> 00:40:51,320
Get in there.

828
00:40:51,320 --> 00:40:52,040
Jump in the fire.

829
00:40:52,040 --> 00:40:53,480
Oh God, I just got back here.

830
00:40:53,480 --> 00:40:54,360
Can we please?

831
00:40:54,360 --> 00:40:55,400
Yeah, Travis, let me calm it down.

832
00:40:55,400 --> 00:40:56,600
I'll calm it down.

833
00:40:56,600 --> 00:40:57,720
I'm gonna bring it down with this one.

834
00:40:57,720 --> 00:40:59,080
It's easy.

835
00:40:59,080 --> 00:41:03,400
Blue Sky says, I jump into the frying pan.

836
00:41:04,040 --> 00:41:05,240
Fuck yes.

837
00:41:05,240 --> 00:41:06,280
Are you kidding me?

838
00:41:07,320 --> 00:41:08,040
Wait, hold on.

839
00:41:08,040 --> 00:41:10,120
That's not one of the options in the saying.

840
00:41:10,120 --> 00:41:11,480
It doesn't matter.

841
00:41:11,480 --> 00:41:12,360
It doesn't matter.

842
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:16,200
It's not like if you can't stay in the kitchen, get into the frying pan.

843
00:41:16,200 --> 00:41:17,400
Like that's not the fucking-

844
00:41:17,400 --> 00:41:21,320
Just so many fucking righteous guys on here.

845
00:41:21,320 --> 00:41:24,040
Just so many fucking cool bros.

846
00:41:24,040 --> 00:41:27,320
Just fucking let me know how sick they are.

847
00:41:27,320 --> 00:41:31,800
Just holding up their giant fish and lobster in their profile pictures.

848
00:41:31,800 --> 00:41:33,000
Let me ask you guys a question.

849
00:41:33,640 --> 00:41:38,920
When it starts cooling down, and I mean getting really cool, do you stay or do you go?

850
00:41:38,920 --> 00:41:41,240
I mean, like it's way too chill.

851
00:41:41,240 --> 00:41:41,960
You know what I mean?

852
00:41:41,960 --> 00:41:45,960
Like everybody's too chill to remember to like eat.

853
00:41:45,960 --> 00:41:47,080
Yeah, yeah, Travis.

854
00:41:47,080 --> 00:41:47,560
You know what?

855
00:41:47,560 --> 00:41:49,560
If given those two options, you know what I'd do?

856
00:41:49,560 --> 00:41:52,680
Stick my balls in the icebox, baby.

857
00:41:52,680 --> 00:41:53,000
Whoa.

858
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:54,520
Oh hell yeah, dude.

859
00:41:54,520 --> 00:41:55,400
That wasn't-

860
00:41:55,400 --> 00:41:56,600
Chill them out.

861
00:41:56,600 --> 00:41:58,280
No, I'm saying like it's chill.

862
00:41:58,280 --> 00:41:59,240
Everybody's relaxed.

863
00:41:59,240 --> 00:42:00,760
Stay for the action.

864
00:42:00,760 --> 00:42:03,240
Here's the best answer because it's the only realistic one.

865
00:42:03,240 --> 00:42:06,120
The only one that sort of actually mirrors my beliefs.

866
00:42:07,080 --> 00:42:11,080
Dark Places says, want to stay, but bail.

867
00:42:16,360 --> 00:42:22,760
Yeah, there is a fucking very quick sort of turnaround on, God, this party's amazing.

868
00:42:22,760 --> 00:42:25,320
To, I have to go.

869
00:42:25,320 --> 00:42:27,160
I can't be here.

870
00:42:27,160 --> 00:42:31,400
There's like, there's three human bodies difference between those two things.

871
00:42:32,440 --> 00:42:36,920
And also I'm building this question on fucking theory and hyperbole.

872
00:42:37,480 --> 00:42:39,160
I'm 37 years old.

873
00:42:39,160 --> 00:42:40,680
I actually have no idea.

874
00:42:40,680 --> 00:42:44,360
Justin watches the mask and the bit where he says P-A-R-T-Y.

875
00:42:44,360 --> 00:42:48,840
Justin has to sit there for a few minutes and actually sort of think of what the answer would be.

876
00:42:48,840 --> 00:42:50,680
That's a great question, James.

877
00:42:50,680 --> 00:42:52,520
Why are we partying?

878
00:42:52,520 --> 00:42:54,440
Our time is so limited.

879
00:42:54,440 --> 00:42:55,240
So fleeting.

880
00:42:55,240 --> 00:42:56,520
Thank you, James.

881
00:42:56,520 --> 00:42:58,840
And thank you to LMFAO for apologizing.

882
00:42:58,840 --> 00:43:00,600
It was a bit transgressive.

883
00:43:00,600 --> 00:43:03,000
I was having a good time and you rolled up.

884
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:07,480
You had a, you know, 48 natty lights and you're like, let's get fucking twisted.

885
00:43:07,480 --> 00:43:11,400
And I was like, I was having a good time catching up with my friends, but I'll see you guys later.

886
00:43:12,760 --> 00:43:13,640
Jesus Christ.

887
00:43:14,200 --> 00:43:15,080
Can we sit back down?

888
00:43:15,960 --> 00:43:17,960
No, no, this is, you gotta get up for this.

889
00:43:17,960 --> 00:43:27,240
I have a creaky floorboard right under me and I just found it.

890
00:43:27,240 --> 00:43:28,680
I want to munch!

891
00:43:28,680 --> 00:43:29,240
Squared!

892
00:43:31,480 --> 00:43:33,560
I want to munch!

893
00:43:33,560 --> 00:43:34,040
Squared!

894
00:43:37,160 --> 00:43:37,960
Welcome to Munch Squad.

895
00:43:37,960 --> 00:43:43,480
It's a podcast within a podcast celebrating the latest and greatest in quick serve restaurants.

896
00:43:43,480 --> 00:43:46,040
McDonald's and Sprite announced the debut of

897
00:43:46,600 --> 00:43:47,240
Oh God.

898
00:43:47,240 --> 00:43:54,760
A new multi-faceted marketing campaign created in celebration of mix, all caps.

899
00:43:55,400 --> 00:43:59,000
So when I say the word mix a few times in the next few moments,

900
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:00,840
you'll know why I'm saying it like that.

901
00:44:00,840 --> 00:44:01,960
Because it's in all caps.

902
00:44:02,520 --> 00:44:10,600
It's a celebration of mix by Sprite Tropic Berry, a sparkling soft drink made with natural flavors.

903
00:44:12,600 --> 00:44:13,320
Yeah, sure.

904
00:44:14,040 --> 00:44:16,600
Each one's got four crushed up berries in it.

905
00:44:16,600 --> 00:44:17,720
Yeah, sure Sprite.

906
00:44:17,720 --> 00:44:18,760
Sure Sprite, okay.

907
00:44:19,720 --> 00:44:23,000
It's 2018, we're all just lying, okay.

908
00:44:23,720 --> 00:44:33,320
Including pineapple, orange, and strawberry blended with a classic crisp lemon-lime taste of Sprite.

909
00:44:33,320 --> 00:44:36,520
Available just for McDonald's customers.

910
00:44:36,520 --> 00:44:41,240
Don't go into Aldi thinking you're gonna get the mix.

911
00:44:41,880 --> 00:44:42,600
Because you're not.

912
00:44:42,600 --> 00:44:45,400
You're only gonna get it at McDonald's and that's why the marketing campaign is called

913
00:44:45,400 --> 00:44:46,920
That's the Mix.

914
00:44:46,920 --> 00:44:50,600
You should only do that if you dress up like a time traveler from the future.

915
00:44:50,600 --> 00:44:54,360
And you roll up to Aldi like, I'll have the pineapple Sprite.

916
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:59,240
I don't know what beautiful world you come from, but here we just got the plain one.

917
00:44:59,240 --> 00:44:59,720
Damn it.

918
00:45:00,360 --> 00:45:06,680
Do you think that they mean natural flavors in the sense that like they are present in this dimension?

919
00:45:07,240 --> 00:45:08,440
Yes, you taste them.

920
00:45:08,440 --> 00:45:11,720
Like these are natural this dimension flavors.

921
00:45:11,720 --> 00:45:13,880
A Warlock didn't conjure them.

922
00:45:13,880 --> 00:45:14,280
Exactly.

923
00:45:14,280 --> 00:45:19,000
Hey dumb-dumbs, I'm loving all this, but I'm never gonna get to the fashion line if you don't let me.

924
00:45:20,600 --> 00:45:25,160
That's the Mix is gonna launch this Friday when we're recording this on Wednesday.

925
00:45:25,160 --> 00:45:28,840
I'm sorry, it was last Friday, May 25th.

926
00:45:28,840 --> 00:45:30,520
It's probably already sold out.

927
00:45:30,520 --> 00:45:38,360
A dedicated Spotify takeover featuring the premiere of an exclusive new track and music

928
00:45:38,360 --> 00:45:47,160
video about this soda from multi-platinum rapper Kyle, all caps, just like Mix, and an original

929
00:45:47,160 --> 00:45:54,040
custom capsule collection by leading streetwear designer Joe Freshgoods.

930
00:45:56,760 --> 00:45:59,960
And I'm sure he'll continue to be a leading streetwear designer

931
00:45:59,960 --> 00:46:04,920
with McDonald's and their special pineapple drink on his resume.

932
00:46:04,920 --> 00:46:10,680
If you're in Atlanta, Chicago, and Los Angeles, New York, you can go to a select McDonald's there

933
00:46:10,680 --> 00:46:16,280
and you're gonna have the rare opportunity to take home items from the That's the Mix capsule

934
00:46:16,280 --> 00:46:21,800
collection, including a, which I guess a capsule collection must mean something else because I'm

935
00:46:21,800 --> 00:46:25,720
thinking Gachapon, but I guess it's just a small collection of clothes maybe.

936
00:46:25,720 --> 00:46:27,240
I don't understand exactly.

937
00:46:27,240 --> 00:46:31,160
But they're clothes that don't have seasonal application.

938
00:46:31,160 --> 00:46:32,120
Okay, thank you.

939
00:46:32,120 --> 00:46:38,840
Yes, they're including a wool and leather varsity jacket, a long sleeve t-shirt about a soda,

940
00:46:38,840 --> 00:46:44,440
short sleeve t-shirt about a great new sprite with pineapple, and socks with McDonald's on them.

941
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:50,440
Beginning at 2 p.m. local time, fans who visit one of the participating locations and say out

942
00:46:50,440 --> 00:46:53,320
loud, I'd like the clothes about the juice, please.

943
00:46:53,320 --> 00:47:00,440
They're going to get pieces from the collection which will be available exclusively at McDonald's

944
00:47:00,440 --> 00:47:05,080
while supplies last, which should be for quite some time, I would imagine.

945
00:47:06,360 --> 00:47:10,840
Now, Linda Van Gosen decides to get fucking hysterical.

946
00:47:10,840 --> 00:47:14,760
Linda opens with, we're mixing things up, so to speak.

947
00:47:17,560 --> 00:47:19,320
That's the mix right there.

948
00:47:19,320 --> 00:47:20,600
That is the mix.

949
00:47:20,600 --> 00:47:22,040
That's the mix, Linda.

950
00:47:23,400 --> 00:47:27,240
We're mixing it up in McDonald's with a new exclusive drink.

951
00:47:27,240 --> 00:47:32,200
I don't know why McDonald's gets its rocks off keeping soda from people,

952
00:47:32,200 --> 00:47:34,680
but that is McDonald's whole fucking thing.

953
00:47:34,680 --> 00:47:35,560
They love it.

954
00:47:35,560 --> 00:47:45,560
The flavor, she says, this vice president of menu innovation, the flavor is craveable and delicious.

955
00:47:45,560 --> 00:47:50,520
That would be so weird if it was craveable and disgusting.

956
00:47:50,520 --> 00:47:52,760
Why do I like this so much?

957
00:47:52,760 --> 00:47:53,800
I can't stop.

958
00:47:53,800 --> 00:47:55,320
I hate it.

959
00:47:55,320 --> 00:47:57,960
Please free me from this.

960
00:47:57,960 --> 00:47:59,000
I hate it.

961
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:03,400
And we know our customers will come back for more of this unique beverage,

962
00:48:03,400 --> 00:48:05,480
which I think is called That's the Mix.

963
00:48:05,480 --> 00:48:11,240
I'm trying to, it just says it's in celebration of Mix by Sprite Tropic Berry.

964
00:48:11,240 --> 00:48:14,600
I guess that's the actual name of the soda.

965
00:48:14,600 --> 00:48:17,560
Yes, it is Mix by Sprite Tropic Berry.

966
00:48:18,760 --> 00:48:23,720
The program launched to McDonald's All American Games Fan Fest on March 25th in Atlanta,

967
00:48:23,720 --> 00:48:28,600
where Kyle premiered That's the Mix, a song about a soda with a live performance,

968
00:48:28,600 --> 00:48:33,880
and fans had the chance to visit the Mix by Sprite Tropic Berry Dug Zone.

969
00:48:37,640 --> 00:48:40,280
Where they were instantly dissolved.

970
00:48:40,280 --> 00:48:43,560
Hi, I'm multi-platinum rapper Kyle.

971
00:48:43,560 --> 00:48:48,760
Welcome to the Mix by Sprite Tropic Berry Dug Zone.

972
00:48:48,760 --> 00:48:50,520
Would you like to hear my new song?

973
00:48:50,520 --> 00:48:52,040
It's about a clear beverage.

974
00:48:52,040 --> 00:48:53,000
That has flavors.

975
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:53,960
Does that make it?

976
00:48:53,960 --> 00:48:55,160
Now you into it?

977
00:48:55,160 --> 00:48:55,960
They're natural.

978
00:48:56,760 --> 00:49:01,080
I would not kick this jacket out of my closet for eating crackers, boys.

979
00:49:02,280 --> 00:49:03,320
Is it good?

980
00:49:03,320 --> 00:49:08,440
I'll say this, Joe Freshgoods lives up to that name.

981
00:49:08,440 --> 00:49:12,200
I also want to say I just shared in Skype with you a link to Joe Freshgoods' website.

982
00:49:12,200 --> 00:49:14,280
Yeah, it's the best website I've ever seen.

983
00:49:14,280 --> 00:49:17,160
Yeah, specifically his collabs page.

984
00:49:17,160 --> 00:49:18,840
I'm actually not seeing any of the images.

985
00:49:18,840 --> 00:49:21,800
I'm just seeing the message that says, I've been killing shit lately.

986
00:49:21,800 --> 00:49:23,720
Page under construction until further notice.

987
00:49:23,720 --> 00:49:25,000
That is correct.

988
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:26,120
That's all that's on there.

989
00:49:26,120 --> 00:49:27,880
Fuck yeah, Joe Freshgoods.

990
00:49:27,880 --> 00:49:28,920
I don't need anything else.

991
00:49:28,920 --> 00:49:29,640
I believe you.

992
00:49:31,400 --> 00:49:32,760
That's a great message from Joe.

993
00:49:32,760 --> 00:49:33,960
Things are going very well.

994
00:49:33,960 --> 00:49:38,040
I apparently don't need a website, so I'm not going to make one right now.

995
00:49:38,040 --> 00:49:41,160
And then when I need one later, I will make a website.

996
00:49:41,160 --> 00:49:49,880
So to get this stuff to participate, you purchase a Mix by Sprite Tropic Berry or any soft drink.

997
00:49:49,880 --> 00:49:51,480
Oh, huh.

998
00:49:51,480 --> 00:49:58,520
On May 25th, and you take your receipt to the organized line and wait in line to see

999
00:49:58,520 --> 00:50:01,480
the prize you won while supplies last.

1000
00:50:02,520 --> 00:50:07,880
To participate without making a purchase, you must obtain a free method entry form at

1001
00:50:07,880 --> 00:50:12,200
the participating restaurant and complete it with your first and last name, your date

1002
00:50:12,200 --> 00:50:16,280
of birth, email address, and then take your completed entry form to the organized line

1003
00:50:16,280 --> 00:50:19,400
and wait in line to see the prize you won while supplies last.

1004
00:50:19,400 --> 00:50:22,760
Can you imagine an exchange more buckwild than,

1005
00:50:22,760 --> 00:50:25,880
Hi, I'm here to win the soda jacket.

1006
00:50:25,880 --> 00:50:30,440
I won't be purchasing any beverages because I hate it.

1007
00:50:31,960 --> 00:50:34,280
I'm a big fan of the idea of soda.

1008
00:50:34,280 --> 00:50:38,360
I love the concept of this new exclusive drink that you're keeping from the plebs that can't

1009
00:50:38,360 --> 00:50:39,720
get into McDonald's.

1010
00:50:39,720 --> 00:50:44,440
And I love this drink and I just want the jacket, but I'm not buying one today.

1011
00:50:44,440 --> 00:50:50,200
So I would like to sit here in this McDonald's and fill out an order form, an entry to perhaps

1012
00:50:50,200 --> 00:50:53,560
win the great jacket about the soda.

1013
00:50:53,560 --> 00:50:57,080
And at this point in our episode, I would like to fast forward like, I don't know, a

1014
00:50:57,080 --> 00:51:02,280
year when McDonald's has gone out of business and Ronald is sitting in an empty McDonald's

1015
00:51:02,280 --> 00:51:04,200
with Kyle and Joe Freshgoods.

1016
00:51:04,200 --> 00:51:09,480
And they're just like sitting on folding chairs and like Ronald raises his drink and they

1017
00:51:09,480 --> 00:51:10,040
cheers him.

1018
00:51:10,040 --> 00:51:13,720
And he goes, I think we can all agree that was the mix.

1019
00:51:13,720 --> 00:51:15,480
And then like fade to credits.

1020
00:51:15,480 --> 00:51:16,520
And then the boat sinks.

1021
00:51:18,120 --> 00:51:22,280
Every few weeks, my friend brings his Wii U over to my house to play Smash Brothers.

1022
00:51:22,280 --> 00:51:26,200
While playing, we typically trash talk and poke fun at each other.

1023
00:51:26,200 --> 00:51:30,840
My four year old daughter loves to watch us and comments on how we're doing.

1024
00:51:30,840 --> 00:51:34,840
One day I was pretty handily beat to stock in about a minute.

1025
00:51:34,840 --> 00:51:35,400
What's that mean?

1026
00:51:36,360 --> 00:51:40,760
You had two lives and you got knocked off the map by, you know, Ness's big baseball

1027
00:51:40,760 --> 00:51:41,800
bat swing, probably.

1028
00:51:41,800 --> 00:51:46,120
My friend, excited in his win, called me a fucking scrub.

1029
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:51,480
Excited by my devastation, my daughter turned to me and shouted quite loudly, you fucking

1030
00:51:51,480 --> 00:51:51,980
scrub.

1031
00:51:51,980 --> 00:51:58,440
How do I get my daughter to love me again and respect my premium game skills?

1032
00:51:58,440 --> 00:52:00,440
And should I worry about her swearing?

1033
00:52:00,440 --> 00:52:01,480
Probably not, right?

1034
00:52:01,480 --> 00:52:04,840
That's from Sulking in Smashville slash Denver.

1035
00:52:04,840 --> 00:52:07,160
I think you need to worry about you being a fucking scrub.

1036
00:52:07,160 --> 00:52:08,280
Yeah, that's a problem, huh?

1037
00:52:08,280 --> 00:52:13,720
You're so quick to assign blame to everybody else in this situation, except for yourself,

1038
00:52:13,720 --> 00:52:17,480
for getting fucking completely dunked on in Final Destination.

1039
00:52:17,480 --> 00:52:20,200
Like, L2P maybe a little bit?

1040
00:52:20,200 --> 00:52:25,320
Like, maybe before you start throwing stones, look at your own glass house and how quickly

1041
00:52:25,320 --> 00:52:28,680
it shatters under the, you know, Salvo Falco's punches.

1042
00:52:28,680 --> 00:52:32,680
Especially when you talk about your daughter respecting your quote unquote premium game

1043
00:52:32,680 --> 00:52:33,180
skills.

1044
00:52:34,040 --> 00:52:36,600
Yeah, kind of sounds like you got put in the toilet.

1045
00:52:36,600 --> 00:52:40,120
Yeah, and like, maybe your daughter is now the daughter of your friend.

1046
00:52:40,760 --> 00:52:42,280
Yeah, sounds like, yeah.

1047
00:52:42,280 --> 00:52:47,560
If my daughter started calling me a fucking scrub, I'd tell her to pick up a controller

1048
00:52:47,560 --> 00:52:48,600
and back up those words.

1049
00:52:48,600 --> 00:52:50,360
1v1 me.

1050
00:52:50,360 --> 00:52:55,160
If you're gonna talk shit, you better 1v1 me, and we'll kind of see who is the best

1051
00:52:55,160 --> 00:52:55,880
at Smash Brothers.

1052
00:52:55,880 --> 00:52:58,760
I don't understand what button punches in that game.

1053
00:52:58,760 --> 00:52:59,800
It's always been a mystery to me.

1054
00:52:59,800 --> 00:53:03,880
My daughter could probably beat me through randomness, so this may not be a great tack.

1055
00:53:03,880 --> 00:53:05,800
But like, still, 1v1 me, daughter.

1056
00:53:05,800 --> 00:53:10,840
And to be fair, Justin did teach his beautiful daughter, Charlie, my niece who I love very

1057
00:53:10,840 --> 00:53:16,200
much, to tell me, her uncle who loves her very much, that she is going to kick his ass.

1058
00:53:16,200 --> 00:53:20,520
So that is a thing that now I live with all the time.

1059
00:53:20,520 --> 00:53:25,560
I've been teaching my daughter to curse for a long time, and I hope that I never reach

1060
00:53:25,560 --> 00:53:26,760
a point where I regret it.

1061
00:53:27,320 --> 00:53:32,760
And perhaps I will, but you guys can take heart in teaching your children to curse,

1062
00:53:32,760 --> 00:53:38,120
confident in the knowledge that if it ever dawns on me that it was a huge mistake, then

1063
00:53:38,120 --> 00:53:40,040
I can kind of warn you away.

1064
00:53:40,040 --> 00:53:47,240
I can be the lighthouse on the Isle of Cursing, and I can ward your ship into safer waters.

1065
00:53:47,240 --> 00:53:51,640
We'll have about two and a half years, like, you'll be able to travel back in time, so

1066
00:53:51,640 --> 00:53:54,920
to speak, to us and say, don't make the same mistakes I did.

1067
00:53:54,920 --> 00:53:57,400
I'm just gonna teach my son weird cuss words.

1068
00:53:57,400 --> 00:53:58,120
Okay.

1069
00:53:58,120 --> 00:54:03,000
Okay, not the main ones, but like, you know, piss.

1070
00:54:05,880 --> 00:54:07,240
That's the only one?

1071
00:54:07,240 --> 00:54:10,840
What was the last time you said, unironically, bastard?

1072
00:54:10,840 --> 00:54:11,560
You know what I mean?

1073
00:54:11,560 --> 00:54:12,120
Yeah.

1074
00:54:12,120 --> 00:54:17,560
My daughter came into our room, and it was 530 in the morning, and we were just trying

1075
00:54:17,560 --> 00:54:20,760
to snooze a little bit, so we were trying to get her to just, like, lay down and try

1076
00:54:20,760 --> 00:54:21,960
to sleep a little bit.

1077
00:54:21,960 --> 00:54:28,600
And then from next to me, I hear, that light on your TV is really annoying, and it's this

1078
00:54:28,600 --> 00:54:33,080
blue light that is on on our TV in our bedroom, always.

1079
00:54:33,080 --> 00:54:36,040
And I say, yeah, it is really annoying.

1080
00:54:36,040 --> 00:54:41,800
And there's about 90 seconds of silence, and then I hear, that light's fucking crazy.

1081
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:48,920
It is, yeah, it is, sweetie.

1082
00:54:48,920 --> 00:54:50,120
It is fucking crazy.

1083
00:54:50,120 --> 00:54:50,920
That's true.

1084
00:54:50,920 --> 00:54:55,080
I don't know why that light does what it does, but you're right.

1085
00:54:55,080 --> 00:54:57,080
And you're like, okay, Coop, we're going back to bed.

1086
00:54:57,080 --> 00:54:58,440
Those are your first words, eh, Coop?

1087
00:54:58,440 --> 00:54:59,000
Thanks.

1088
00:54:59,000 --> 00:54:59,720
Great.

1089
00:54:59,720 --> 00:55:02,120
Well, this has been a heck of a lot of fun.

1090
00:55:02,120 --> 00:55:03,400
We hope you've enjoyed yourself.

1091
00:55:03,400 --> 00:55:05,000
I'm loving standing.

1092
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:05,880
I'm going to make that a thing.

1093
00:55:05,880 --> 00:55:07,080
You know, I'm a little over it.

1094
00:55:07,640 --> 00:55:08,360
Okay.

1095
00:55:08,360 --> 00:55:11,800
Well, because once I stood up, I realized, like, well, where do I go from here?

1096
00:55:11,800 --> 00:55:12,600
You know what I mean?

1097
00:55:12,600 --> 00:55:15,160
I feel great if I can get in control of the room.

1098
00:55:15,160 --> 00:55:15,720
Anyway.

1099
00:55:15,720 --> 00:55:22,520
So real quick, I wanted everyone to know, next weekend, Dad and I are going to be in

1100
00:55:22,520 --> 00:55:28,520
a live stream that Wizards of the Coast is doing to announce their new D&D campaign,

1101
00:55:28,520 --> 00:55:29,800
their new D&D story.

1102
00:55:30,760 --> 00:55:33,480
And the stream is called Stream of Many Eyes.

1103
00:55:34,920 --> 00:55:36,120
Dad is performing in one.

1104
00:55:36,120 --> 00:55:37,000
I'm performing another.

1105
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:41,720
We're going to be, Merle and Magnus, with different DMs.

1106
00:55:41,720 --> 00:55:45,320
My DM is Chris Perkins, which I'm, like, super excited about.

1107
00:55:45,320 --> 00:55:45,880
Yes.

1108
00:55:45,880 --> 00:55:46,360
I know.

1109
00:55:46,360 --> 00:55:48,760
You are in for a good sesh, my friend.

1110
00:55:48,760 --> 00:55:49,720
I'm very excited.

1111
00:55:49,720 --> 00:55:52,360
It's going to be live streamed, so you can watch it from wherever.

1112
00:55:53,080 --> 00:55:58,360
If you want to find out more details about it, you can go to dnd.wizards slash articles

1113
00:55:58,360 --> 00:56:03,480
slash events slash S-O-M-E slash some and get all the things.

1114
00:56:03,480 --> 00:56:05,640
Or you can just, like, look on our Twitter accounts.

1115
00:56:05,640 --> 00:56:06,440
We tweeted about it.

1116
00:56:07,960 --> 00:56:09,000
We're going on the road.

1117
00:56:11,320 --> 00:56:13,080
Okay, Travis, did you misspell-

1118
00:56:13,080 --> 00:56:14,120
I can't believe it.

1119
00:56:14,120 --> 00:56:14,440
Fuck!

1120
00:56:14,440 --> 00:56:16,040
I misspelled our own last name.

1121
00:56:16,040 --> 00:56:17,320
I spelled McElroy-

1122
00:56:17,320 --> 00:56:19,160
Go to m-a-c-e-l-r-

1123
00:56:20,600 --> 00:56:22,680
McElroy shows dot com slash tours.

1124
00:56:22,680 --> 00:56:31,080
We're going to be in Phoenix in June and in Orlando and Atlanta at the end of August.

1125
00:56:31,080 --> 00:56:37,400
And also, we're going to be doing some shows for our book tour, which are going to be more,

1126
00:56:37,400 --> 00:56:40,360
like, Q&A with some readings of the book.

1127
00:56:40,360 --> 00:56:41,480
But those are still going to be fun.

1128
00:56:41,480 --> 00:56:42,360
Those are in July.

1129
00:56:42,360 --> 00:56:46,280
You can find details on all that at McElroy shows dot com slash tours.

1130
00:56:46,280 --> 00:56:51,800
Or you can pre-order the graphic novel at theadventurezonecomic dot com.

1131
00:56:51,800 --> 00:56:55,480
My wife and I, Sydney and her sister Taylor, we wrote a book.

1132
00:56:55,480 --> 00:56:58,680
It's called The Sawbones Book.

1133
00:56:58,680 --> 00:57:00,360
It's about our podcast Sawbones.

1134
00:57:00,360 --> 00:57:01,480
It's not about our podcast.

1135
00:57:01,480 --> 00:57:02,920
It's not like a behind the scenes.

1136
00:57:02,920 --> 00:57:05,240
It's similar to our podcast, Taylor to the Illustrations.

1137
00:57:06,520 --> 00:57:10,280
And it's going to be great if you go to bit.ly forward slash Sawbones Book.

1138
00:57:10,280 --> 00:57:13,480
It comes out in October, but you can pre-order it now.

1139
00:57:13,480 --> 00:57:14,760
And I hope you really like it.

1140
00:57:14,760 --> 00:57:15,880
Uh, one last thing.

1141
00:57:15,880 --> 00:57:19,000
We have a merch website, McElroy Merch dot com.

1142
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:23,480
We are constantly, well not constantly, but we are trying to add new stuff to it as often

1143
00:57:23,480 --> 00:57:24,200
as possible.

1144
00:57:24,200 --> 00:57:29,800
And I will say right now, I am wearing our Adventure Zone Bureau of Balance hoodie.

1145
00:57:29,800 --> 00:57:32,280
It is so incredibly comfortable.

1146
00:57:32,920 --> 00:57:38,920
And 90s Travis loves it because there's holes sewn into the cuffs that I can put my thumbs

1147
00:57:38,920 --> 00:57:39,720
through.

1148
00:57:39,720 --> 00:57:40,520
Fantastic.

1149
00:57:40,520 --> 00:57:41,560
I love it.

1150
00:57:41,560 --> 00:57:45,480
We've also got a new, we're doing a Bureau of Balance bracer that's only going to be

1151
00:57:45,480 --> 00:57:50,840
on pre-sale for another like week or so.

1152
00:57:50,840 --> 00:57:52,120
I think another week.

1153
00:57:52,120 --> 00:57:55,400
And there's also a monthly pin that changes out.

1154
00:57:56,440 --> 00:58:01,400
May's is an abracafuckupin, available in both explicit and non-explicit.

1155
00:58:01,400 --> 00:58:02,280
Cause we were curious.

1156
00:58:02,280 --> 00:58:07,080
Getting some interesting A, B comparisons on how nasty y'all are.

1157
00:58:07,080 --> 00:58:10,600
Yeah, largely nasty, but some not so nasty.

1158
00:58:10,600 --> 00:58:11,240
Interesting.

1159
00:58:11,240 --> 00:58:12,520
That's at McElroy Merch dot com.

1160
00:58:13,160 --> 00:58:16,440
Thanks to John Roderick and the Long Winters for the use of our theme song, It's a Departure

1161
00:58:16,440 --> 00:58:17,960
off the album, Putting the Days to Bed.

1162
00:58:17,960 --> 00:58:19,720
I've been listening to that one this week.

1163
00:58:19,720 --> 00:58:20,280
It's a good one.

1164
00:58:20,280 --> 00:58:21,720
Some of the older albums too.

1165
00:58:21,720 --> 00:58:23,880
Thanks to Maximum Fun for having us on the network.

1166
00:58:23,880 --> 00:58:27,960

You want that final though?

1170
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:35,880
Wait, hold on.

1171
00:58:35,880 --> 00:58:36,920
I want to do, hold on.

1172
00:58:36,920 --> 00:58:37,960

Coming up Simpsons.

1210
01:00:19,960 --> 01:00:24,280
Every episode we cover a different episode of the Simpsons that is a favorite of our

1211
01:00:24,280 --> 01:00:25,160
special guest.

1212
01:00:25,160 --> 01:00:29,080
We've had guests that are showrunners and writers and voice actors like Nancy Cartwright.

1213
01:00:31,720 --> 01:00:34,680
And we've also had people that are on the Max Fun Network already.

1214
01:00:34,680 --> 01:00:37,560
Homer wearing that golf outfit is so funny.

1215
01:00:37,560 --> 01:00:42,840

I was just struck by how sharp the writing is.

1218
01:00:47,800 --> 01:00:49,720
I mean, that's no surprise because it's the Simpsons.

1219
01:00:49,720 --> 01:00:53,400
But I mean, like, you can't say that about a lot of TV shows, particularly ones that

1220
01:00:53,400 --> 01:00:55,800
at that point had been on the air for 14 years.

1221
01:00:55,800 --> 01:01:00,920

1222
01:01:00,920 --> 01:01:01,400
All right.

1223
01:01:01,400 --> 01:01:19,400
Smell you later.
