1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:16,000
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:30,800
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:48,240
Hello, everybody. Top of the podcast to you.

6
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:50,400
A top of the morning to you.

7
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:51,120
Oh, Christ.

8
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:52,800
But that's the last time.

9
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:53,360
You said it.

10
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:55,920
Oh, lady, lady, lady.

11
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:56,560
I didn't know.

12
00:00:56,560 --> 00:00:58,720
A touch of the Blarney Stone.

13
00:00:58,720 --> 00:01:01,920
Okay, that's all that you know Irish-wise.

14
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:03,360
Me lucky charms.

15
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:04,240
Okay, that's-

16
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:06,720
Hello, lady, lady, lady.

17
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:11,360
Okay, well, you said you might try that, but I didn't think you would sort of-

18
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:13,520
I'm doing the rest of the podcast in this-

19
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:16,240
Oh, no, you're not. That I won't be.

20
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:18,400
Is it offensive, what he's doing?

21
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:21,120
I can't- I don't know, because, like, we have some of that heritage.

22
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:26,160
So, like, I don't know if it's like- it's like how people- if you're in a wheelchair and-

23
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:28,320
It's not offensive, me boyo.

24
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:31,360
It's like if you're in a wheelchair and you pass someone else in a wheelchair,

25
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:32,560
you're allowed to push them over.

26
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:36,160
Like, I think this is sort of in that similar vein.

27
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:39,120
So are you- are you saying you'd like me to stop?

28
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:42,880
No, I'm saying you sound like a handicapped person.

29
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:50,720
So, what- this weekend, this St. Paddy's weekend, what are you guys getting rump-a-dumped on?

30
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:52,980
Meth?

31
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:56,800
That's not really like a traditional Irish-

32
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:57,920
Yeah.

33
00:01:57,920 --> 00:01:59,280
I'm gonna drop it into Guinness.

34
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:03,040
Oh, I see. What do you call that concoction?

35
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:04,080
Irish Car Death.

36
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:06,640
That's not a good name.

37
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:07,280
No?

38
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:08,240
That's not a good name.

39
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:10,720
How about the sore- the sore tooth?

40
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:16,400
Doesn't that drink sound like it would be called the sore tooth in circles?

41
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:18,240
A sore- a sore tooth?

42
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:18,740
Uh-huh.

43
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:23,520
Now, what would be the l- what would be the derivation of this name?

44
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:26,400
Uh, when you do meth, it makes your teeth hurt.

45
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:27,040
Oh, okay.

46
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:30,880
And so, when you drop it into Guinness, it's a sore tooth, because that's sort of a fun-

47
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:33,280
sort of a fun, edgy bath name.

48
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:35,920
Sort of a fun take on meth, right?

49
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:38,560
It's basically the most fun way to take meth.

50
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:43,040
The most, like, footloose and fancy-free form of meth consumption.

51
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:47,840
On a completely different note, not in any way advocating the use of meth,

52
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:51,040
did you guys see- I think it was American Eagle or Urban Outfitter,

53
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:57,360
like, got- is- is being, like, sued by Irish Defamation Leagues or something?

54
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:57,680
What?

55
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:58,400
Why?

56
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:00,720
Well, they- they had a t-shirt that said, like,

57
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:03,280
kiss me, I'm Irish, you're drunk, or whatever.

58
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:04,880
And-

59
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:07,040
Kiss me, I'm Irish, you're drunk, or whatever?

60
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:07,520
Yeah.

61
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:10,560
And- and they were told that that was offensive to-

62
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:11,120
Yeah, maybe a little bit.

63
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:15,120
To Irish heritage, and so, like, they had to take it off their websites and stuff.

64
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:18,240
Well, and also, it's offensive to drunk people, because-

65
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:19,600
And also, it's stupid.

66
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:23,200
I've never been so drunk that I forgot my fucking nationality.

67
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:28,880
It should say, help me, I'm drunk, or Irish, or whatever,

68
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:30,960
I just don't know, and I'm really scared.

69
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:34,240
I've been looking for my apartment for, like, two- two hours now.

70
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:36,400
It's very cold outside.

71
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:39,520
That's how homeless people get their start, usually.

72
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:41,920
This is an advice show for the modern era.

73
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:43,760
I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy.

74
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:45,600
I'm your middle-est brother, Travis McElroy.

75
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:47,360
I'm your baby brother, Griffin McElroy.

76
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:52,400
Uh, let's- let's not waste any more time with these- with these, uh,

77
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:56,400
blind alleys of racial danger.

78
00:03:57,040 --> 00:04:00,080
Let's, uh, let's get right into the advice.

79
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:05,120
I work at a grocery store where we're required to stay clean-shaven at all times.

80
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:11,440
Over vacation, I grew a beard that every- everyone thought really worked for me,

81
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:14,640
including myself, only to have to shave it off.

82
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:17,840
I'm not a big fan of this job, and I was considering getting other work.

83
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:21,920
I'm a student, can- can be unemployed for a while.

84
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:23,600
Is this a valid reason to quit?

85
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:28,240
Should I risk unemployment to get a job I can have a beard at?

86
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:30,640
Yes.

87
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:31,840
This is Travis.

88
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:33,040
Wait, what?

89
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:34,320
No, Travis.

90
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:34,560
No?

91
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:35,360
No.

92
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:40,320
I'm just saying that if he was already, like, thinking about leaving this job,

93
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:41,600
if he's not happy with this job,

94
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:45,760
I feel like it would be a real power move to walk into the boss's office and say, like,

95
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:47,680
listen, Bill, I'm going to be honest with you.

96
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:50,000
I'm quitting because I want to have a beard.

97
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,320
Listen, there's- there is one thing in this world.

98
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:57,520
I don't know much about women, but I do know that the two things that they love

99
00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:01,520
are newly grown beards and unemployment.

100
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:03,920
These are two things- these are two traits.

101
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:06,960
When you get the- the scraggle, you know what I'm talking about?

102
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:09,440
The scraggle where you're just growing it?

103
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:10,480
Ladies love that.

104
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:10,720
Oh, yeah.

105
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:12,000
Especially- especially-

106
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,080
Scratchy and abrasive on their face.

107
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:15,040
Waste scragged.

108
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:18,720
When it's attached to a man who doesn't have a steady form of income coming in,

109
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:21,280
ladies can't get enough.

110
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:24,880
A look that says I have this beard because I can't afford to shave it.

111
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:30,400
In all seriousness, in- in the modern age, in this day and age,

112
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:33,600
there's no reason to quit a job without having another job lined up.

113
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:37,600
But there's so many jobs- there's so many jobs out there.

114
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:41,920
I think you can just pretty safely quit and then just know that you're gonna get caught

115
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:44,000
by- by some sort of safety net.

116
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,120
Yes, because in this economy, jobs are everywhere.

117
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:49,200
Yeah, they're like littering the streets like-

118
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:52,560
And people are like, hey, Obama, how about we destroy some of these jobs?

119
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:55,840
To- just to reduce job inflation, right?

120
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:58,400
All these spare jobs are sitting around making me feel guilty.

121
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:02,720
I have to get two or three jobs just to make myself feel good in the morning.

122
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:06,640
What jobs- what jobs do you have currently, Trev?

123
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:10,160
Well, as you know, I work for the theater.

124
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:14,160
I also am a carriage driver in the park.

125
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:15,840
Oh, really?

126
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:16,560
Uh-huh.

127
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:17,920
And I kill bats.

128
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:19,920
Wait a minute.

129
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:24,080
I never knew killing bats was professional for you.

130
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:25,760
Well, you have to turn in the pelts.

131
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:30,560
For EXP.

132
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:33,760
Yeah, monster.

133
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:36,880
And then you can turn them into like cloaks and belts and stuff.

134
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:39,040
If- if your skill is high enough.

135
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:43,200
I am moonlighting as Stanley Tucci's wax man.

136
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:49,120
I don't know that I possess that skill, nor that I have that connection with the Tucci,

137
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:49,680
as I call him.

138
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:51,520
Justin?

139
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:53,200
I put dolphins back in their place.

140
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:54,320
Oh, man.

141
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:58,960
Now wait, do you mean like dolphins who like get trapped in sewers because they jumped weird?

142
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:00,160
Or do you mean like-

143
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:01,040
You mean the uppity dolphins?

144
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:01,600
Yeah.

145
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:02,880
No, I mean dolphins.

146
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:04,880
It starts to think that they're people.

147
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:06,720
God damn it.

148
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:08,400
You take that hat off.

149
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:11,360
Take that hat off and give me back my fish.

150
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:15,520
That was in my sandwich and it was unacceptable.

151
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:17,760
Your hijinks have no sway here.

152
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:20,560
I get back in the ocean, sir.

153
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:23,360
And then I- that's pretty much it.

154
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:24,640
And then I get all sheepish.

155
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:25,360
And that's a job?

156
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:27,360
That's a job.

157
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:29,040
Who pays you to do this?

158
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:30,240
Sharks.

159
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:31,760
Sharks.

160
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:32,880
Sharks.

161
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:34,800
Sharks pay me in apples.

162
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:41,360
The maritime economy is so strange.

163
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:43,360
They don't know what we use.

164
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:46,800
All these ocean apples.

165
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:48,320
You humans like apples, right?

166
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:49,280
Hey, you like apples?

167
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:51,120
Like, dolphins don't like fish.

168
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:52,800
It's just what we throw at them because they're dumb.

169
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:56,240
Like, sharks- sharks pay me in apples.

170
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:58,480
They think that that's the kind of currency.

171
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:00,800
I don't know why.

172
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:02,240
Fucking sharks, man.

173
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:06,080
No, don't, like, have another- get another job.

174
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:08,080
This should be a good role for everybody.

175
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:10,160
Get another job before you quit the last job.

176
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:11,600
So, before beard.

177
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:15,920
Or go in and be like, grow your beard out secretly.

178
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:17,280
Wear a burqa or something.

179
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:19,680
Grow your beard out secretly and go in and be like,

180
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:21,200
this is what you are missing.

181
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:22,720
Also, you need-

182
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:23,920
Look at this look.

183
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:28,080
You need to take a long look in that deep, dark, truthful mirror

184
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:30,480
and really think about if this beard

185
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:32,880
that you grew over a vacation

186
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:37,520
is really as critically acclaimed as you said it is.

187
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:40,800
Really think about that.

188
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:42,560
Really think about the inflection people had.

189
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:44,880
On last day was a six-month vacation.

190
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:46,960
Yeah, did they say- did they say,

191
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:48,560
oh, um-

192
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:49,200
A beard.

193
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:50,640
That looks great.

194
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:52,080
I kept to-

195
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:53,040
Keep it up.

196
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:56,880
I kept a scrowdy, rowdy, scraggle-daggle on my face

197
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:59,360
for a couple of years

198
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:01,920
before I realized that,

199
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:04,000
hey, this doesn't actually look very good.

200
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:08,000
And I had tricked myself into thinking it was all the rage.

201
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:08,720
I know.

202
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:10,240
I still feel guilty about that.

203
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:14,320
Griffin walked around looking like a Bob Denver impersonator

204
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:16,960
and I said nothing to him.

205
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:20,080
You know, from Gilligan's Island.

206
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:22,240
Also, uh, Dobie Gillis.

207
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:23,680
Dobie Gillis.

208
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:25,120
Take care of your face.

209
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:27,680
It's the only gift you have.

210
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:29,600
That's all you've got going for you.

211
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:31,040
All you've got going for is your face.

212
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:31,920
Don't cover it up.

213
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:33,280
Don't fuck up your moneymaker.

214
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:34,240
That's where-

215
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:35,920
No, your moneymaker's your fucking job.

216
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:36,960
Don't fuck that up either.

217
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:40,080
Your moneymaker's your bagging hands.

218
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:41,440
You gotta keep those safe.

219
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:42,800
Don't worry about your face.

220
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:44,320
I just also want to throw out

221
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:47,280
what kind of fucking grocery store doesn't let people have beard?

222
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:48,240
Like, I don't understand-

223
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:51,200
I- If you find out, let me know and I will attend.

224
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:54,000
It will be my sole source of grocery.

225
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:56,640
You don't want to buy my Aunt Jemima

226
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:58,960
from someone that's not clean shorn.

227
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:01,040
In this bag, I'm gonna put your eggs

228
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:02,240
and I'm gonna put your juice

229
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:04,400
and I'm gonna put a few of these little chin hairs.

230
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:07,680
Just gonna sprinkle them in there like so much oregano.

231
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:11,440
Maybe he works in the deli or something.

232
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:13,600
Or we'll get that.

233
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:16,160
That made me sense, right?

234
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:19,280
Don't they make beard nets for just such an occasion?

235
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:21,760
Yeah, but you can't be, like, walking around with a beard net.

236
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:22,240
It's weird.

237
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:23,040
Mm-hmm.

238
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:24,640
You can't be seen with a beard net.

239
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:26,640
This is a jockstrap, basically.

240
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:28,080
A jockstrap for your chin.

241
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:28,320
Yeah.

242
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:30,480
It's also, like, saying to the world, like,

243
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:32,960
I've got this beard, but I cannot keep a handle on it.

244
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:35,760
His beard is out of control.

245
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:37,760
It's like boarding school for beards.

246
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:38,400
Like, you can't-

247
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:41,280
You can't- It's saying, like, I don't know what to do with it.

248
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:42,880
It's got its own mind.

249
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:46,160
Mind of its own, I'd say.

250
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:46,560
Griffin.

251
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:48,320
You want a Yahoo answer?

252
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:49,520
Yeah.

253
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:52,720
This is great.

254
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:54,320
This one was sent in by Lisa Holifield.

255
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:54,960
Thank you, Lisa.

256
00:10:55,520 --> 00:11:03,840
It's by Yahoo Answers user Holly, who posted in the Yahoo Answers rodents category.

257
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:07,920
And asks, how to take care of a duck.

258
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:11,680
I'm thinking of getting a pet duck, but I don't know much about them.

259
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:12,240
Clearly.

260
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:17,520
Some phylum genus action would be good.

261
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:17,920
Just to-

262
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:19,360
Maybe just, like, a dictionary.

263
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:21,120
Just look up the word duck.

264
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:22,560
Have you seen the duck yet?

265
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:26,960
Respondent Yahoo Answers user CP4 says,

266
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:29,520
well, the first thing you should know is that it is not a rodent.

267
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:35,280
Oh, Yahoo Answers, taking care of our light work since 2010.

268
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:38,080
Yahoo Answers, taking care of our light work since 2003.

269
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:40,240
Yahoo Answers user Matt says,

270
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:42,800
here's a list I've constructed for your consideration.

271
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:44,720
One, let the duck go.

272
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:46,800
Two, watch the duck fly away.

273
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:49,040
Three, go buy a rodent.

274
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:50,960
Four, go about with your normal life.

275
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:53,680
Source?

276
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:56,080
I am a duckologist.

277
00:11:56,080 --> 00:12:08,320
Well, the first thing you're gonna want to do, so many people neglect.

278
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:10,000
Webbing cream.

279
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:13,040
They get a lot of irritation there.

280
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:13,520
Are you-

281
00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:16,720
Now, is this a cream that you make out of duck foot webbing?

282
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:17,440
Or is this-

283
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:18,480
That would be cruel.

284
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:19,840
No, this is a balm.

285
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:24,400
It's a poultice that you rub onto the webbing of a duck.

286
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:30,240
So from its day of like stepping on pine cones and other irritants,

287
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:36,800
it will soothe the webbing and make sure that it stays, you know, uninfected.

288
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:40,480
Now, step two, and this is a tricky one and it's gonna take some time,

289
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:43,200
but you have to train the duck to say, put it on my bill.

290
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:47,280
It's the only good reason to have a duck.

291
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,200
Oh man, what a duck.

292
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:53,440
What a great duck.

293
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:56,160
Griffin, do you have any duck raising tips?

294
00:12:57,200 --> 00:13:07,840
Um, make it a, um, fucking, uh, make it a shirt.

295
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:09,520
Make it, I guess, duck clothes.

296
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:15,440
Dress it up like Scrooge McDuck, obviously.

297
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:16,720
That's good.

298
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:18,880
Yeah, I wish I said that.

299
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:20,560
Little spats on its webbed feet.

300
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:25,200
Um, I can't imagine having a bird.

301
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:31,120
I was at a, uh, a hamburger stand the other day eating a hamburger.

302
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:32,160
Was this a food truck?

303
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:35,520
No, no, it was a, it was an establishment.

304
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:37,840
They just didn't have an indoor dining area.

305
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:41,360
They had some shit out back where you could just chill on some picnic tables

306
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:43,760
and enjoy your frozen custard.

307
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:49,840
And I was there and I was, I was just surrounded by pigeons

308
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:57,680
and finches and, and sparrows in all manner of, of tiny woodland birds.

309
00:13:57,680 --> 00:14:01,840
And, uh, I just had a constant panic attack the entire time I was there.

310
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:05,040
Couldn't enjoy my meal because I was surrounded by tiny birds.

311
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:08,960
And I have friends here in Texas who have like chickens.

312
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:10,160
You have pet chickens.

313
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:10,560
Can't.

314
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:11,680
Unacceptable.

315
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:12,560
Can't fathom.

316
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:13,520
Okay.

317
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:14,560
Cause here's the thing.

318
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:17,120
I agree with you, Griffin, a hundred percent.

319
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:20,240
And I know of people that have like cockatiels and

320
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:21,760
parrots and that kind of thing.

321
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:24,960
And it's like, okay, they're, you know, they're beautiful birds

322
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:27,680
and they fly around, but a duck or like a chicken,

323
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:31,120
they're just like a big stupid walking around on the ground bird.

324
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:31,760
Yeah.

325
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:32,960
Like don't get it.

326
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:34,400
Think about bird for a second.

327
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:38,240
Like if you have a pet bird, pet bird, like if you have a dog,

328
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:40,080
it can come and snuggle up on you.

329
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:46,000
Cat can pat its little, little feet on you and, and, and ignore you most of the time.

330
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:46,560
Yeah.

331
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:50,640
A bird has two methods of interaction with the outside world.

332
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:53,120
Talons and a poker.

333
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:54,400
That's it.

334
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:54,880
All it can do is-

335
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:56,880
Talons and a poker and yelling.

336
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:58,480
Just come up and yelling.

337
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:00,080
Shitting everywhere.

338
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:03,200
Like those are the interactions a bird can have with the outside world.

339
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:04,640
Why would you want that in your home?

340
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:06,480
Why would you want anything?

341
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:08,960
I'm going to offend so many people right now.

342
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:09,280
Sorry, bird.

343
00:15:09,280 --> 00:15:10,560
A dog and a cat.

344
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:12,640
Why would you want anything other than a dog and a cat?

345
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:14,800
You can teach a dog to go outside.

346
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:16,480
You can teach a cat to poop in a box.

347
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:16,800
Okay.

348
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:21,120
But what about hilariously comically large rabbits?

349
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:22,320
Okay.

350
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:22,880
That's fine.

351
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:26,400
And like, and you call them like Floppenstein or something?

352
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:28,400
How about sugar gliders?

353
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:33,600
Oh, that's what, cause that's been the problem with mice this whole time.

354
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:34,960
Their inability to fly.

355
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:38,560
Thank God for sugar.

356
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:45,680
Thank you County Ferris all over this great land for putting a race of flying mice throughout

357
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:46,080
the-

358
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:46,960
Forgiven it.

359
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:51,440
And also just FYI, sugar glider pelts aren't worth as much as bat.

360
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:55,280
You only make that mistake once.

361
00:15:55,280 --> 00:15:56,240
Travis has a chart.

362
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:01,760
If you do, ladies and gentlemen, this is a plea from me to you.

363
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:06,000
If you do buy a duck and take it home to raise your own,

364
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,640
or don't let him drop out of school.

365
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:13,760
There's, there's going to be a real temptation because he won't understand any of it and

366
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:14,480
he can't write.

367
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:20,320
But a duck without an education, there's nothing sadder in my opinion.

368
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:32,240
And if you, if the duck that you have adopted becomes, let's say racially insensitive towards

369
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:38,080
Japanese people, then you really, really need to take a good hard look at it because there's

370
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:40,560
a good chance that you just adopted Gilbert Gottfried.

371
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:51,120
He is similar to ducks, not only in fashion, but in manner, which is why he was such a

372
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:52,800
perfect choice for the Aflac.

373
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:54,720
This bit is fucking stupid.

374
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:59,040
Bad news for you, I'm editing today.

375
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:00,080
So I'm going to frame it.

376
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:04,080
I'm going to frame it with special sound effects and guitar riffs.

377
00:17:04,080 --> 00:17:07,600
And here it is, Griffin's bit about Gilbert Gottfried.

378
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:10,880
There's a goof in there somewhere about how Gilbert Gottfried is duck-like.

379
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:14,720
But I think the Aflac connection sort of sullies.

380
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:17,360
The problem, your problem is, was looking for the goof.

381
00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:21,760
Like you should just say, I, I, earlier I had something about sharks paying me with

382
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:22,080
apples.

383
00:17:22,080 --> 00:17:24,160
Just say the first goddamn thing that comes to your head.

384
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:25,760
Let the goof find you.

385
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:29,360
Then 90% of the audience would hear it and be like, oh, he's making a dumb Aflac goof.

386
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:33,360
But the other 10% would understand how avant-garde that was.

387
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:35,840
How edgy your Gilbert Gottfried goof was.

388
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:40,480
If you guys could adopt one celebrity, who would it be?

389
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:42,480
Obviously not Gilbert Gottfried.

390
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:44,000
He's going to keep you rolling, right?

391
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,800
With, with all the, with all like the zingers.

392
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:51,600
But I don't think that the rest of it would make up for it.

393
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:52,480
Ian McShane.

394
00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:53,360
Okay.

395
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:57,360
What would Ian McShane be like, Travis?

396
00:17:57,360 --> 00:18:00,400
Mostly he'd just shuffle around the house in a bathrobe cursing.

397
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:02,240
Sounds pretty good.

398
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:02,800
Yeah, right?

399
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:03,680
Wouldn't that be awesome?

400
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:06,880
And just have friends over and be like, oh, don't mind my Ian McShane.

401
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:09,680
Don't let him, don't let him climb on your lap.

402
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:12,480
Ian, down, down, down.

403
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:12,800
Ian.

404
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:17,360
I'm going to go, I'm going to go with Giamatti.

405
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:22,480
Oh, he would, I imagine him like hiding up in the corner of the ceiling.

406
00:18:23,040 --> 00:18:25,360
Just spot him with a flashlight to get him down.

407
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:26,080
Don't look at him.

408
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:27,440
It's a challenge.

409
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:29,440
Giamatti.

410
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:33,600
Do you know what the problem with having a pet Giamatti is?

411
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:35,440
He's a Pokemon.

412
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:38,000
Giamatti.

413
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:40,160
Giamatti, go.

414
00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:41,920
You're so skittish.

415
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:43,280
Go.

416
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:44,320
Oh, God.

417
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:48,720
Giamatti is the human equivalent of a comically large rabbit, I feel like.

418
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:51,440
Oh, crap.

419
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:52,640
Justin.

420
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:54,480
What?

421
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:56,400
You got a celeb?

422
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:59,040
I'm not going to adopt a celebrity to make any goddamn sense.

423
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:00,880
They're people.

424
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:01,920
They live in houses.

425
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:03,440
They are human beings.

426
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:04,800
I don't understand.

427
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:05,920
I don't understand the question.

428
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:09,440
Hey, I'm a guy and also a monster.

429
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:10,560
Oh, whoa.

430
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,600
And also a monster.

431
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:14,800
And also a monster.

432
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:22,160
I started sleeping with a close friend of mine, a girl, who also plays bass in my band,

433
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:24,400
bass in my band.

434
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:29,520
We were, quote, friends with benefits, end quote, for about six months, but it never

435
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:32,880
really developed into an exclusive relationship.

436
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:36,800
She feels heartbroken because I recently slept with another girl, and this may have

437
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:39,040
ruined a wonderful friendship as well as our band.

438
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:41,680
Is there any way to salvage our friendship?

439
00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:45,040
Probably unforgivable.

440
00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:50,880
So I guess the band maybe is not finding the success that he had hoped for.

441
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:52,880
That's maybe not top priority at this point.

442
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:53,380
Right.

443
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:56,960
Hey, dude, you done goofed.

444
00:19:56,960 --> 00:19:57,840
Yeah, oh, man.

445
00:19:57,840 --> 00:19:59,840
The number of ways in which you've goofed.

446
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:04,000
You goofed, but if you can keep the band together, wow, you're going to write some

447
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:04,640
good stuff.

448
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:08,960
Look at Fleetwood Mac.

449
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:10,400
Oh, yeah.

450
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:17,200
Like, they fought and fought and fought and fought and they didn't stay in love, but

451
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:18,800
they stayed in love with the music.

452
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:22,240
And the pain, you can just feel it in Tusk.

453
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:25,360
Nothing powers good rock and roll like sexual contempt.

454
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:26,420
Right.

455
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:33,200
Holland Oates, so bitter, so broken hearted.

456
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:34,800
I can't believe you did this to me, Oates.

457
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:39,520
Dave Matthews Band, there's so many members, you know, some people.

458
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:45,600
Let's just say Oates has that mustache to cover a really, really embarrassing scar,

459
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:46,640
and let's leave it at that.

460
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:49,840
I think this is the problem with the friends with benefits deal.

461
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:51,520
Yeah, because it's a fantasy.

462
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:53,120
Yeah, it really is.

463
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:55,600
It's a game.

464
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:59,440
It doesn't work because you're sitting there and you're like, oh, this is so nice, and

465
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:03,440
there's no strings attached, and I can do whatever, and then you sleep with someone

466
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:05,120
else and you somehow piss them off.

467
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:11,600
In that explanation, you actually reference two movie titles about having sex with your

468
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:13,040
bud, Bud Love.

469
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:15,200
You've got a friends with benefits deal.

470
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:18,320
And you've got a friends with benefits deal with Crocodile Dundee.

471
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:30,560
The thing about friends with benefits is that it seems like a smashing idea if you're a

472
00:21:30,560 --> 00:21:37,840
single person, but what's friends with benefits is more is a constant beautiful reminder of

473
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:40,320
the power of biology over us.

474
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:46,240
Like, we think to ourselves, hey, I think that I'll do this friends with benefits thing,

475
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:47,920
and biology is like, oh, yeah, good one.

476
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:49,920
No one's ever thought of that before.

477
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:53,040
I won't force you to have emotions about this, but of course you do.

478
00:21:53,040 --> 00:21:53,680
Of course you do.

479
00:21:54,320 --> 00:22:02,320
The human heart is not as much older and wiser than our rapidly crumbling morales.

480
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:06,880
Yes, and unfortunately, there are certain chemicals and things released in your brain

481
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:11,920
during intimate moments that make you feel emotionally connected to the person.

482
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:14,160
Yeah, like horny dioxide and things like that.

483
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:19,600
They get in there and they trigger the love center.

484
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:20,800
Boner juice.

485
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:22,560
Boner juice is just another one.

486
00:22:22,560 --> 00:22:26,160
Less scientific, of course, but no less real and actual.

487
00:22:26,160 --> 00:22:27,360
Street slang.

488
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:30,320
Street slang that Griffin uses for brain chemicals.

489
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:35,600
This is the thing, though, like you played the game of bones and you lost.

490
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:38,000
This is what happens.

491
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:44,720
You try to come out on top, and no one ever does.

492
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:46,720
Except for Dinklage.

493
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:47,360
What?

494
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:48,320
Except Dinklage.

495
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:49,360
Except Pete Dink.

496
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:50,800
Pete Dink, number one.

497
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:58,320
I think the problem is the friends with benefits move, that play,

498
00:22:58,320 --> 00:23:02,480
that play is like cheating because you're saying like,

499
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:06,080
I want to have the sex, but I don't want to put the time in the relationship.

500
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:07,920
So basically, I think what you're really saying is,

501
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:10,080
I want to do this thing and eventually fuck it up.

502
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:11,460
Right.

503
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:15,600
Yeah, there's no good ending to that.

504
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:20,320
The arc, if you look at the arc, it just doesn't pan out.

505
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:26,560
The only good arc to keep, and maybe this is my Protestant upbringing

506
00:23:26,560 --> 00:23:32,320
rearing its head, is just to keep unrealized sexual tension forever.

507
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:32,880
Yeah.

508
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:35,200
Until you're so old that you don't feel that anymore.

509
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:37,440
In that way sexier?

510
00:23:38,560 --> 00:23:39,760
Isn't that sexier?

511
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:45,600
Sort of puritanical, button down, keep it under your apron type approach.

512
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:49,200
Yeah, you hide it right under your bonnet.

513
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:50,560
Guys, how about another Yahoo?

514
00:23:50,560 --> 00:23:50,880
Please.

515
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:51,200
Do it.

516
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:56,880
Do it. This one was sent in by Jacob Locker.

517
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:58,080
Thank you, Jacob.

518
00:23:58,080 --> 00:24:03,200
It's by Yahoo Answers user cdmaxteambringit, who asks,

519
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:06,000
how pathetic are the rock haters?

520
00:24:09,040 --> 00:24:11,680
Rock haters are usually mostly Cena marks,

521
00:24:11,680 --> 00:24:14,880
but Cena fans have no idea how good the rock was,

522
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:16,800
how good the rock can still be.

523
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:19,280
Everybody knows the rock is holding back,

524
00:24:19,280 --> 00:24:22,560
and to whoever thinks it's funny that the rock made the Tooth Fairy movie,

525
00:24:22,560 --> 00:24:25,520
you're dumb, because he made more money off that movie

526
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:27,680
than you will ever make in your entire life.

527
00:24:28,560 --> 00:24:30,720
Cena hasn't been owning the rock.

528
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:33,600
John Cena is nowhere near the rock's level,

529
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:35,920
and the only reason that it looks like he is

530
00:24:35,920 --> 00:24:39,280
is because the rock is holding back to make Cena look good.

531
00:24:39,280 --> 00:24:42,320
Cena's jokes aren't funny, and Cena is terrible in general.

532
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:46,480
Another argument rock haters have is he sold out.

533
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:47,840
No, he didn't sell out.

534
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:49,520
The only thing the rock sold out,

535
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:51,840
the only thing the rock sold out was arenas,

536
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:53,760
and he is still selling out arenas.

537
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:56,560
So what if he left WWE in 2004?

538
00:24:56,560 --> 00:24:57,600
It's his life.

539
00:24:57,600 --> 00:24:59,440
Why should we tell him how to live it?

540
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:00,320
Bonus question.

541
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:01,280
Agree, disagree.

542
00:25:01,280 --> 00:25:02,800
John Cena isn't funny.

543
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:08,320
Bonus question.

544
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:12,480
I don't, there wasn't really a question in there anywhere.

545
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:17,040
How pathetic are the rock haters is the question.

546
00:25:17,040 --> 00:25:18,560
Apparently very pathetic.

547
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:23,120
Like, what does he want, what does he want?

548
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:25,360
What does he want me to say?

549
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:27,200
Okay, the rock is cool.

550
00:25:27,920 --> 00:25:29,440
He made more money than me.

551
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:31,520
Like, he's very rich.

552
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:35,680
He's very rich, and he's very, I guess he's bald now.

553
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:39,600
It's a two-part question.

554
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:40,240
Okay.

555
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:40,720
Part one.

556
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:43,520
Pathetic are the rock haters, and how, what are your,

557
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:46,480
what are just your general feelings on John Cena?

558
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:48,640
Okay, John Cena.

559
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:49,360
Pay me a picture.

560
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:51,360
John Cena has muscles.

561
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:52,240
Let's get that out of the way.

562
00:25:53,280 --> 00:25:55,120
And he was the Marine, I think?

563
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:56,000
He was in the Marine.

564
00:25:57,040 --> 00:26:01,280
And he, when he gets angry, or he's about to get beat,

565
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:04,800
he rips off his yellow tank top,

566
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:07,600
and the song I'm a Real American plays,

567
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:09,920
and he goes, oh yeah, brother.

568
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:11,520
He says he's a Cena maniac.

569
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:13,680
I'm a Cena maniac, brother.

570
00:26:13,680 --> 00:26:15,120
I've got Cena-phobia.

571
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:17,040
I've got Cena-phobia, bro.

572
00:26:17,040 --> 00:26:18,480
Well, that's probably accurate.

573
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:22,880
The only thing I know about John Cena is that his,

574
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:26,480
quote, wrestling costume is a t-shirt and jean shorts.

575
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:29,760
Like, he just could not be bothered.

576
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:32,400
That is actually the official wrestling costume

577
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:36,320
of both the Stonewall Club and the New Polo Club in Huntington.

578
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:39,280
So if you're ever around, and you're gonna do some wrestling there,

579
00:26:39,280 --> 00:26:41,840
make sure you get your cut-off jean shorts early,

580
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:44,720
because most of the common sizes go quick.

581
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:47,600
John Cena's original wrestling name was actually Jortsman.

582
00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:51,760
Or, if you will, Jortsman.

583
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:53,920
He wore a mask.

584
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:59,120
I'm the Jortsman, and I'm here to stuff it.

585
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:03,840
Stuff what?

586
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:06,320
Wrestling touchdowns?

587
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:09,280
His legs, his legs in the jort holes.

588
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:13,360
Check out these socks.

589
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:16,000
You like how long the socks are?

590
00:27:16,560 --> 00:27:17,200
Stuff it!

591
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:21,600
My jorts are comfortable and easy to wear.

592
00:27:23,040 --> 00:27:24,160
I'm web savvy.

593
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:26,240
It's a meme.

594
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:27,040
Oh, man.

595
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:30,560
Fuck, The Rock is awesome.

596
00:27:30,560 --> 00:27:33,120
Has anyone seen Fast Five in this podcast?

597
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:33,760
Other than me?

598
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:34,960
No.

599
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:35,600
No.

600
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:39,760
There's a scene where The Rock and Vin Diesel just wail on each other.

601
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:41,920
They just go crazy.

602
00:27:41,920 --> 00:27:42,880
Like romantically?

603
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:46,880
There's strong romantic undertones,

604
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:49,280
but it's mostly them just throwing each other through walls.

605
00:27:50,560 --> 00:27:51,600
And you know what?

606
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:52,720
I watched that.

607
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:54,160
I watched that movie ironically,

608
00:27:54,160 --> 00:27:56,320
but I came out with the very unironic position

609
00:27:56,320 --> 00:27:58,480
that The Rock is actually pretty fucking awesome.

610
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:01,360
I mean, have you seen-

611
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:02,320
Is it Walking Tall?

612
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:05,200
Uh, I've seen both Walking Tall and The Rundown.

613
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:07,840
The Rundown, now The Rundown rules.

614
00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:08,240
Yeah.

615
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:12,400
The Rundown is a movie where the ending is actually telegraphed

616
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:15,040
in the first 30 seconds of the film,

617
00:28:15,040 --> 00:28:20,880
because The Rock can't touch guns because bad things happen.

618
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:24,400
And if you don't know how the movie ends now,

619
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:27,920
then you should turn in your cinephile badge

620
00:28:27,920 --> 00:28:29,520
that I made you last week.

621
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:31,520
Your cinephile badge?

622
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:32,480
Your cinephile badge?

623
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:34,080
Your cinephile badge.

624
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:38,640
I don't go to the cinema.

625
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:40,560
I go to the cinema.

626
00:28:40,560 --> 00:28:44,560
I only see movies starring John Cena.

627
00:28:45,920 --> 00:28:48,560
Guys, I worked in a movie theater when The Marine came out,

628
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:54,000
and the number of cups, like Dixie cups,

629
00:28:54,000 --> 00:29:01,520
full of skull leavings would turn your stomach.

630
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:02,640
Quick quiz, hotshot.

631
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:07,040
Is the Cineplex a move that John Cena does,

632
00:29:07,040 --> 00:29:10,080
or a place where you see a lot of John Cena movies?

633
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:10,720
I don't know.

634
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:12,080
I don't know.

635
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:13,040
It's wordplay.

636
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:16,560
It's a double entendre.

637
00:29:16,560 --> 00:29:23,440
I often forget that the rock wrestler with hair

638
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:30,640
is the same person as the bald rock that is in movies.

639
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:31,520
The Balrog?

640
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:35,360
The Balrog of a man that is in movies.

641
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:37,040
My brain just doesn't connect them

642
00:29:37,040 --> 00:29:38,800
as the same entity sometimes.

643
00:29:38,800 --> 00:29:41,280
That's because he's Dwayne Johnson now.

644
00:29:41,280 --> 00:29:41,780
Right.

645
00:29:41,780 --> 00:29:47,300
Dwayne Johnson, which I can understand, of course,

646
00:29:47,300 --> 00:29:48,260
why he changed that name.

647
00:29:48,260 --> 00:29:49,620
It's not particularly memorable,

648
00:29:49,620 --> 00:29:51,700
unless you put the rock in the middle of it.

649
00:29:51,700 --> 00:29:54,420
His original wrestler name was actually the Dwayne.

650
00:29:56,100 --> 00:29:57,220
It was the Dwayne versus Georgeman.

651
00:29:57,220 --> 00:29:59,780
I would have started watching wrestling

652
00:29:59,780 --> 00:30:01,540
to become a fan of the Dwayne.

653
00:30:01,540 --> 00:30:03,380
I'm gonna stomp you, Georgeman.

654
00:30:03,940 --> 00:30:04,820
I'm the Dwayne.

655
00:30:06,340 --> 00:30:07,140
Make it Dwayne.

656
00:30:08,020 --> 00:30:09,140
I'm gonna make it Dwayne.

657
00:30:09,140 --> 00:30:11,220
Bring the Dwayne.

658
00:30:12,980 --> 00:30:15,380
I think he should have just gone for the agro crag.

659
00:30:15,380 --> 00:30:17,060
That's what I would have called myself.

660
00:30:17,060 --> 00:30:18,180
The radical rock.

661
00:30:18,180 --> 00:30:20,020
Come break a piece off this radical rock.

662
00:30:22,900 --> 00:30:23,940
Oh, the rock.

663
00:30:26,500 --> 00:30:29,700
Do people really get this up in arms about their wrestlers?

664
00:30:30,340 --> 00:30:32,100
Is this the way things are going?

665
00:30:32,100 --> 00:30:33,140
It's crazy.

666
00:30:33,140 --> 00:30:34,820
It's crazy on the streets, right?

667
00:30:34,820 --> 00:30:37,220
I watched Wrestlemania for the first time last year,

668
00:30:37,220 --> 00:30:46,180
and there were people in the audience

669
00:30:46,820 --> 00:30:48,980
who, when their guy lost,

670
00:30:49,620 --> 00:30:52,900
they would just commit seppuku right there,

671
00:30:54,100 --> 00:30:54,980
holding up signs.

672
00:30:55,780 --> 00:30:57,860
John 3.14, whatever, seppuku.

673
00:31:00,500 --> 00:31:01,700
I'm not kidding you.

674
00:31:01,700 --> 00:31:04,340
It was a fervor that I haven't seen.

675
00:31:04,340 --> 00:31:07,540
I mean, the Beatles have nothing on some of these guys.

676
00:31:11,700 --> 00:31:14,020
The only thing that I ever took away from wrestling,

677
00:31:14,020 --> 00:31:16,180
and I know this is just too bad

678
00:31:16,180 --> 00:31:17,860
because we talked about Pokemon a little bit earlier,

679
00:31:17,860 --> 00:31:20,500
but to me, getting upset about it

680
00:31:20,500 --> 00:31:24,100
is like getting upset about Pikachu losing a fight

681
00:31:24,100 --> 00:31:25,620
because you know what's going to happen

682
00:31:25,620 --> 00:31:27,300
is he's going to get angry

683
00:31:27,300 --> 00:31:29,620
and he's going to get his electricity back

684
00:31:29,620 --> 00:31:31,220
and then he's going to come back strong.

685
00:31:31,220 --> 00:31:34,740
Like Hulk Hogan and Pikachu

686
00:31:34,740 --> 00:31:36,580
are basically the same story arc.

687
00:31:38,980 --> 00:31:40,260
Hulk Hogan gets pinned.

688
00:31:40,260 --> 00:31:40,740
He's beat.

689
00:31:40,740 --> 00:31:41,940
He's down for the count.

690
00:31:41,940 --> 00:31:43,460
Then they lift his hand up

691
00:31:43,460 --> 00:31:47,220
and he keeps it up the third time.

692
00:31:47,220 --> 00:31:48,900
They drop his hand and he keeps it up

693
00:31:48,900 --> 00:31:50,820
because he's got America power.

694
00:31:50,820 --> 00:31:52,500
And he comes back and he just-

695
00:31:52,500 --> 00:31:54,980
He does renaissance commercials.

696
00:31:54,980 --> 00:31:58,660
Exactly, Travis.

697
00:31:58,660 --> 00:31:59,780
Exactly what I meant.

698
00:31:59,780 --> 00:32:02,500
Pikachu, exact same.

699
00:32:02,500 --> 00:32:03,300
Gets kicked around.

700
00:32:03,300 --> 00:32:07,700
He gets those little pound signs on his face

701
00:32:07,700 --> 00:32:09,620
that mean he's been beaten up.

702
00:32:09,620 --> 00:32:10,260
And then-

703
00:32:10,260 --> 00:32:12,740
He gets one big sad anime tear

704
00:32:12,740 --> 00:32:13,860
that appears over his head.

705
00:32:13,860 --> 00:32:14,580
And Ash is like,

706
00:32:14,580 --> 00:32:16,100
Pikachu, I don't care if you win or not.

707
00:32:16,100 --> 00:32:16,900
I still love you.

708
00:32:16,900 --> 00:32:17,620
Yeah, I still love you

709
00:32:17,620 --> 00:32:18,660
because we're friends forever.

710
00:32:18,660 --> 00:32:21,460
And then he falls into an earth's wild electric socket.

711
00:32:21,460 --> 00:32:23,620
And then Pikachu just murders everyone.

712
00:32:23,620 --> 00:32:24,660
Then just comes back and murders everyone.

713
00:32:24,660 --> 00:32:25,460
It's the exact same story.

714
00:32:25,460 --> 00:32:26,260
They're both yellow.

715
00:32:26,980 --> 00:32:28,020
They both have ears.

716
00:32:28,020 --> 00:32:30,500
Pikachu's original wrestler name was Thunder Boy

717
00:32:30,500 --> 00:32:31,220
with an I.

718
00:32:32,100 --> 00:32:32,740
Oh yeah?

719
00:32:33,620 --> 00:32:35,380
It was actually Thunder Boy Tellum.

720
00:32:36,660 --> 00:32:37,780
But he shortened it.

721
00:32:37,780 --> 00:32:38,740
He shortened it.

722
00:32:38,740 --> 00:32:40,820
Because it's a fit on t-shirts that he was selling.

723
00:32:41,380 --> 00:32:43,540
Hey, we can't sell t-shirts

724
00:32:43,540 --> 00:32:44,740
with Thunder Boy written on them.

725
00:32:45,700 --> 00:32:46,740
Because it's copyrighted.

726
00:32:46,740 --> 00:32:48,260
Because it's copyrighted.

727
00:32:48,260 --> 00:32:49,860
So we have to rely on the money zone.

728
00:32:49,860 --> 00:32:58,340
Guys, let's pull this shit into the dock of money.

729
00:32:58,340 --> 00:33:00,340
Oh, money dock.

730
00:33:01,380 --> 00:33:06,420
We have been waiting on this culmination of this campaign.

731
00:33:07,620 --> 00:33:09,860
Okay, five weeks ago, I want to take you back.

732
00:33:09,860 --> 00:33:12,260
Five weeks ago, we got an email

733
00:33:12,260 --> 00:33:17,460
that we were going to be promoting a product called

734
00:33:17,460 --> 00:33:23,140
Stack Soap and the crazy person in charge of this product,

735
00:33:23,140 --> 00:33:26,100
which is an infinite cycle of soap.

736
00:33:26,100 --> 00:33:28,340
It's a soap bar with a divot in it.

737
00:33:28,340 --> 00:33:31,060
So once you've used the first bar up,

738
00:33:31,060 --> 00:33:34,340
you can slide the remaining sliver in

739
00:33:34,340 --> 00:33:35,780
and it makes a whole new bar.

740
00:33:35,780 --> 00:33:38,420
And that cycle continues in perpetuity.

741
00:33:38,420 --> 00:33:41,220
When we were told by our Maximum Fun overlords

742
00:33:41,220 --> 00:33:43,780
that we were going to be promoting this product,

743
00:33:43,780 --> 00:33:46,420
and they wanted to raise $9,000,

744
00:33:46,420 --> 00:33:48,980
there was a part of me, I got to admit, that thought,

745
00:33:48,980 --> 00:33:49,940
hey, that's great.

746
00:33:49,940 --> 00:33:51,780
Thanks for the money, stupid.

747
00:33:51,780 --> 00:33:53,300
Thanks for the money, dumbo.

748
00:33:53,940 --> 00:33:56,820
Sorry, we're really going to give it the old college try.

749
00:33:58,820 --> 00:34:02,660
But sorry, there's no chance that this is going to pan out for you.

750
00:34:02,660 --> 00:34:06,020
And in just five short weeks, they've managed to make more

751
00:34:06,020 --> 00:34:09,860
goddamn money than we ever made off this show in the entire year.

752
00:34:09,860 --> 00:34:15,300
They managed to make more goddamn money than we ever made off this show in the entire time we've been doing it.

753
00:34:15,300 --> 00:34:16,900
So good on them.

754
00:34:17,620 --> 00:34:18,900
Good on you, Stack Soap.

755
00:34:18,900 --> 00:34:22,260
You've grown too powerful and we have to destroy you.

756
00:34:23,940 --> 00:34:27,860
$17,000 goddamn dollars.

757
00:34:29,140 --> 00:34:30,580
It's got to have reached a point.

758
00:34:30,580 --> 00:34:32,740
I don't want to stop you from going and giving more money

759
00:34:32,740 --> 00:34:34,500
because Eric's doing a great job

760
00:34:34,500 --> 00:34:36,020
and this soap thing is a brilliant idea

761
00:34:36,020 --> 00:34:38,100
and the Stack Soap is going to be huge.

762
00:34:38,100 --> 00:34:41,620
But I'm just saying, yeah, the $9,000 goes to the dye

763
00:34:41,620 --> 00:34:45,780
and then he could get some new fragrances and colors and stuff.

764
00:34:45,780 --> 00:34:47,860
Yeah, he's going to sample a lot of fragrances,

765
00:34:47,860 --> 00:34:50,180
which is code for do a bunch of coke.

766
00:34:51,780 --> 00:34:55,620
That extra $8,000 is going straight up his nose.

767
00:34:55,620 --> 00:34:58,740
Which, great, you know, maybe that's the kind of juice that he needs

768
00:34:58,740 --> 00:35:02,100
to come up with brilliant ideas like fucking Forever Soap.

769
00:35:02,100 --> 00:35:03,220
Yeah, Forever Soap.

770
00:35:03,220 --> 00:35:07,540
Well, we should come up with that instead of wasting, what is it now, 94 hours?

771
00:35:07,540 --> 00:35:10,100
Just palling around, talking about Pokemon.

772
00:35:10,100 --> 00:35:11,620
We could have been making soap.

773
00:35:11,620 --> 00:35:14,260
We could have made some crazy soap thing.

774
00:35:14,260 --> 00:35:16,340
He didn't even make fucking soap.

775
00:35:16,340 --> 00:35:18,980
He made a video about how he wants to make soap.

776
00:35:20,420 --> 00:35:21,940
He made hypothetical soap.

777
00:35:21,940 --> 00:35:26,340
He made fantasy soap and we gave him $17,000.

778
00:35:26,340 --> 00:35:28,260
He said, I have soap ideas.

779
00:35:29,780 --> 00:35:31,700
I have a soap concept.

780
00:35:31,700 --> 00:35:33,220
I want to whiteboard this with you.

781
00:35:33,780 --> 00:35:35,940
Please give me so much money.

782
00:35:35,940 --> 00:35:39,540
And meanwhile, we're talking about wrestling and Pokemon,

783
00:35:39,540 --> 00:35:44,340
not spending a single moment thinking of new soap-ovations.

784
00:35:44,340 --> 00:35:47,620
And this guy's getting rich off of it, but God bless him.

785
00:35:47,620 --> 00:35:48,260
God bless you.

786
00:35:48,980 --> 00:35:51,220
You guys are pretty fantastic people.

787
00:35:51,940 --> 00:35:56,820
And you have made Eric turn him into a mini mogul, I think.

788
00:35:56,820 --> 00:36:03,460
And he is going to use the pledges to start this line of soap.

789
00:36:03,460 --> 00:36:11,060
And it is not, well, depending on when you get this, it is not too late.

790
00:36:11,060 --> 00:36:14,500
You can still rush in for a last minute pledge.

791
00:36:14,500 --> 00:36:21,540
If you pledge $10 or more, you can get six bars of soaps shipped straight to you.

792
00:36:21,540 --> 00:36:28,980
Or you can get 12 bars for $25 and you'll be on the ground floor of something.

793
00:36:28,980 --> 00:36:33,060
Even if you listen to this episode in three weeks, four weeks,

794
00:36:33,060 --> 00:36:36,420
and you're behind and you've missed the deadline to donate,

795
00:36:36,420 --> 00:36:38,980
still check out Tax Soap because I think it's going to be huge.

796
00:36:38,980 --> 00:36:40,340
And I think people are really going to love it.

797
00:36:40,900 --> 00:36:43,460
And so go ahead and check it out and find out about it

798
00:36:44,020 --> 00:36:46,500
because you're going to want to know about it in the future, I think.

799
00:36:46,500 --> 00:36:48,260
Yeah, it's just taxsoap.com.

800
00:36:48,260 --> 00:36:53,300
And as requested, as promised, I should say,

801
00:36:54,500 --> 00:36:59,860
we have got a jingle that is over a month in the making.

802
00:36:59,860 --> 00:37:02,980
Don't fucking talk about that.

803
00:37:02,980 --> 00:37:08,340
And it's been something Griffin's been sort of working on in his spare time

804
00:37:08,340 --> 00:37:09,940
in his off hours in the basement.

805
00:37:09,940 --> 00:37:15,300
Five weeks, about 35 minutes of work on it.

806
00:37:16,100 --> 00:37:19,300
Yeah, just hours of tinkering.

807
00:37:19,300 --> 00:37:21,460
He just wants, sometimes he'll say like, can I hear it?

808
00:37:21,460 --> 00:37:23,540
And he'll be like, he's not ready.

809
00:37:23,540 --> 00:37:24,420
It sounds tinny.

810
00:37:24,980 --> 00:37:29,300
Bring up the speaker on the base.

811
00:37:29,300 --> 00:37:30,420
It's got hand claps.

812
00:37:30,420 --> 00:37:31,220
It's got bass.

813
00:37:31,220 --> 00:37:32,260
It's got kazoo noises.

814
00:37:32,260 --> 00:37:33,140
It's got layering.

815
00:37:34,260 --> 00:37:35,380
It's going to be amazing.

816
00:37:35,380 --> 00:37:38,100
So here it is.

817
00:37:38,100 --> 00:37:47,860
Put your soap in my soap and we'll both get clean together.

818
00:37:50,500 --> 00:37:52,420
Put your soap in my soap.

819
00:37:54,020 --> 00:37:57,940
It's got a divot for your pleasure.

820
00:37:57,940 --> 00:38:00,260
You've got to use Stack Soap.

821
00:38:02,660 --> 00:38:05,140
Don't you waste your soap away.

822
00:38:08,180 --> 00:38:10,340
You've got to use Stack Soap.

823
00:38:12,740 --> 00:38:15,220
Buy yourself some bars today.

824
00:38:20,020 --> 00:38:22,420
Don't let your skin get dry.

825
00:38:22,420 --> 00:38:25,300
Stack Soap, don't use no lye.

826
00:38:25,300 --> 00:38:28,100
Stack your soap into the sky.

827
00:38:30,980 --> 00:38:35,460
Buy yourself a little hope with Stack Soap.

828
00:38:44,900 --> 00:38:45,860
Stack Soap.

829
00:38:47,540 --> 00:38:48,580
Get yourself clean.

830
00:38:50,180 --> 00:38:51,300
Buy a soup bar.

831
00:38:51,300 --> 00:38:53,940
That's where you find it.

832
00:38:53,940 --> 00:38:56,580
Get it on Kickstarter.

833
00:38:56,580 --> 00:39:02,580
It's going to smell so fresh.

834
00:39:06,020 --> 00:39:06,520
Soap.

835
00:39:11,940 --> 00:39:12,440
Wow.

836
00:39:12,980 --> 00:39:13,460
I don't know.

837
00:39:14,660 --> 00:39:17,940
I hope I win the Grammy this year for best soap song.

838
00:39:17,940 --> 00:39:21,780
Griffin, I have heard some songs before.

839
00:39:22,340 --> 00:39:29,300
But in comparison to that, they're just random collections of beeps and boops.

840
00:39:29,300 --> 00:39:33,060
Yeah, everything else just sounds like audio garbage.

841
00:39:33,700 --> 00:39:35,300
I cried soapy tears.

842
00:39:35,300 --> 00:39:38,100
Yeah, it hurt really bad.

843
00:39:38,100 --> 00:39:42,420
I cried soapy tears because this motherfucker just made 17 grand

844
00:39:43,460 --> 00:39:45,140
to come up with a soap-ovation.

845
00:39:45,140 --> 00:39:48,740
Fun. Also, soapy tears was my favorite 1950s comedian.

846
00:39:52,500 --> 00:39:56,420
He's a toast of vodka now he's storming Broadway.

847
00:39:56,420 --> 00:39:57,620
Soapy tears.

848
00:39:58,340 --> 00:40:01,700
Come learn his signature dance, the scorch.

849
00:40:01,700 --> 00:40:03,700
Do you remember that time when soapy tears?

850
00:40:03,700 --> 00:40:07,300
There's a big controversy because he told kids to go in their parents wallet

851
00:40:07,300 --> 00:40:10,740
and email him and mail him their social security cards.

852
00:40:10,740 --> 00:40:14,260
Email me your social security cards.

853
00:40:14,260 --> 00:40:16,260
Fuck, fuck, shit.

854
00:40:16,260 --> 00:40:18,260
Just feed it into your gramophone.

855
00:40:20,420 --> 00:40:24,100
I'm more popular than Justin Bieber will be in 80 years.

856
00:40:24,100 --> 00:40:25,460
I'm soapy tears.

857
00:40:25,460 --> 00:40:28,340
Soapy tears was our nation's greatest prognosticator.

858
00:40:29,940 --> 00:40:31,620
Now let's all do the scorch.

859
00:40:31,620 --> 00:40:33,620
And it turns out that the scorch was the Dougie.

860
00:40:37,620 --> 00:40:38,900
Let me teach you how to scorch.

861
00:40:41,060 --> 00:40:41,540
Fuck.

862
00:40:41,540 --> 00:40:44,660
Guys, we have a new brother and sister. Did you know this?

863
00:40:46,500 --> 00:40:51,860
I'm worried that mom and dad Jesse and Teresa aren't going to love us as much anymore.

864
00:40:51,860 --> 00:40:52,340
They won't.

865
00:40:52,900 --> 00:40:54,660
But here's the good news.

866
00:40:54,660 --> 00:40:58,740
We have a new awesome hilarious podcast on the maximumfun.org network.

867
00:41:00,740 --> 00:41:02,500
This is just as soapy tears predicted.

868
00:41:05,540 --> 00:41:07,940
I thought it was just the scribblings of a bad man.

869
00:41:07,940 --> 00:41:12,340
He said one day an actual woman and an actual homosexual

870
00:41:12,340 --> 00:41:15,140
will record a podcast together about their plight

871
00:41:15,700 --> 00:41:17,460
and it will be called Throwing Shade.

872
00:41:17,460 --> 00:41:21,380
And it will edge out the love that Jesse and Teresa have.

873
00:41:21,380 --> 00:41:24,020
It will cut into the love of my brother, my brother and me.

874
00:41:24,820 --> 00:41:26,340
They will be cast aside.

875
00:41:27,060 --> 00:41:27,940
Not be the scorch.

876
00:41:29,780 --> 00:41:34,020
Travis, can you tell us a little bit more about this new program?

877
00:41:34,020 --> 00:41:37,380
Well, it's not a new program, but it's new to our family.

878
00:41:37,380 --> 00:41:44,820
Throwing Shade, they take issues that affect the female and homosexual community

879
00:41:44,820 --> 00:41:47,380
and treat them with less respect than they deserve.

880
00:41:49,540 --> 00:41:52,260
Is that a company line or is that your own?

881
00:41:52,260 --> 00:41:55,380
No, that's their company line. I'm not judging in any way. I love it.

882
00:41:56,180 --> 00:41:59,220
It can be slightly more political than you might be used to,

883
00:41:59,220 --> 00:42:04,340
but in episode 18, which was their first Max Fun episode,

884
00:42:04,340 --> 00:42:07,380
within the first like 10 minutes, Brian talks about

885
00:42:07,380 --> 00:42:09,780
shoehorning his soft penis into somebody's butt.

886
00:42:09,780 --> 00:42:12,260
With a literal shoehorn?

887
00:42:12,260 --> 00:42:13,540
Like with a literal shoehorn.

888
00:42:13,540 --> 00:42:16,180
Oh, I've got to get down on this podcast.

889
00:42:16,180 --> 00:42:18,100
So I highly recommend it.

890
00:42:18,100 --> 00:42:22,900
It's hosted by Aaron Gibson and Brian Safi and it's very funny.

891
00:42:24,420 --> 00:42:27,060
Everybody needs to go listen to it and show it the same

892
00:42:27,620 --> 00:42:31,460
love that you showed us when we so recently joined the Maximum Fun Network.

893
00:42:31,460 --> 00:42:35,300
I promise. I really think you guys will like it, so make sure you check it out.

894
00:42:36,660 --> 00:42:41,300
Yeah, it's great. And just promise you won't love them as much.

895
00:42:41,300 --> 00:42:44,100
Yeah, I promise you. Yeah, still love us.

896
00:42:44,100 --> 00:42:45,940
But love them, but mainly us.

897
00:42:45,940 --> 00:42:48,260
Yeah, love us more, I guess I would say.

898
00:42:49,380 --> 00:42:51,460
And them less, but still some.

899
00:42:51,460 --> 00:42:53,220
But still some, but not much.

900
00:42:54,100 --> 00:43:00,420
Not as much. Don't like throw us overboard like you did with the soap thing.

901
00:43:00,420 --> 00:43:05,300
When you describe when you decided you're going to run wild like Hulkamania on this soap concept

902
00:43:05,300 --> 00:43:09,060
and leave your old buddies, Justin and Griffin, without Travis.

903
00:43:10,100 --> 00:43:13,540
Well, I've never thought of you as like much of a soap guy.

904
00:43:13,540 --> 00:43:15,380
I feel like Griffin and I could be in the soap biz.

905
00:43:15,380 --> 00:43:16,180
I'm not sure you would.

906
00:43:17,220 --> 00:43:19,620
I've been a soap man since before you were born, Justin.

907
00:43:19,620 --> 00:43:24,260
If we get any bats in the soap factory, I'll have you come by and de-bat the place.

908
00:43:27,060 --> 00:43:30,100
My British friend is in her first year of med school in the US

909
00:43:30,100 --> 00:43:33,700
and has recently decided that she can't maintain a long distance relationship

910
00:43:33,700 --> 00:43:35,460
with her longtime boyfriend in the UK.

911
00:43:36,580 --> 00:43:40,660
Problem is that he's already booked tickets to visit her over spring break

912
00:43:40,660 --> 00:43:42,740
and he won't be able to get the money back.

913
00:43:42,740 --> 00:43:46,020
Oh, when is the right time for her to break up with him?

914
00:43:46,020 --> 00:43:48,500
Before, during or after the visit?

915
00:43:49,220 --> 00:43:52,660
She's asking me for advice and I'm at a loss would tell her help.

916
00:43:53,780 --> 00:43:55,700
That's from Stumpton, Cincinnati.

917
00:43:55,700 --> 00:43:57,860
Well, you've indirectly come to the right place.

918
00:43:57,860 --> 00:44:02,180
Oh man, there's so many issues here.

919
00:44:02,180 --> 00:44:07,860
First off, I can imagine, like it was tough enough to maintain a relationship

920
00:44:08,580 --> 00:44:12,740
in med school when I lived in the same places as my now wife.

921
00:44:12,740 --> 00:44:16,100
Like I can't imagine trying to do that long distance.

922
00:44:16,100 --> 00:44:19,700
Yeah, with a fucking continental divide between you, there's no way.

923
00:44:20,740 --> 00:44:23,620
Well, we're not telling her anything, she already doesn't know.

924
00:44:23,620 --> 00:44:27,860
With all the plate shifting and the tectonics.

925
00:44:27,860 --> 00:44:32,660
If he can't refund the ticket, you have to take,

926
00:44:32,660 --> 00:44:36,420
like you should have known that this wouldn't have worked before you left.

927
00:44:36,420 --> 00:44:40,580
So this is your punishment for not ending it before then

928
00:44:40,580 --> 00:44:42,900
is you have to try to keep it up.

929
00:44:43,780 --> 00:44:44,500
Really?

930
00:44:44,500 --> 00:44:44,740
No.

931
00:44:44,740 --> 00:44:45,220
Yeah, you do.

932
00:44:46,340 --> 00:44:48,260
That is patently bad advice.

933
00:44:48,260 --> 00:44:49,300
I disagree.

934
00:44:49,300 --> 00:44:54,740
I think before you got to go before so that they come and then they have the opportunity

935
00:44:54,740 --> 00:44:56,020
of they flying to America.

936
00:44:56,020 --> 00:44:58,180
They don't have to hang out with you if they don't want to.

937
00:44:59,300 --> 00:45:02,260
So like they still come or they say like, fuck it, I don't want to go

938
00:45:02,260 --> 00:45:06,660
because otherwise the other thing is if you do it during that's bad.

939
00:45:07,220 --> 00:45:11,060
If you do it after you've just spent like a week with this person,

940
00:45:11,060 --> 00:45:13,300
super awkward and totally not into them at all.

941
00:45:13,940 --> 00:45:15,460
Oh God, you're right.

942
00:45:15,460 --> 00:45:16,580
God damn it.

943
00:45:16,580 --> 00:45:21,940
How much a ticket from the UK to the US is how many euros?

944
00:45:23,700 --> 00:45:26,100
I think it's like, depending on, you know,

945
00:45:26,900 --> 00:45:33,060
anywhere from 600 to $1,000, I think to get round trip.

946
00:45:33,060 --> 00:45:34,340
So like 20 euros.

947
00:45:34,340 --> 00:45:36,340
So like 20 to 25 euros.

948
00:45:36,340 --> 00:45:37,140
Right, exactly.

949
00:45:37,140 --> 00:45:42,180
How I would pay $1,000 to not have to go through this.

950
00:45:44,260 --> 00:45:46,100
I actually think that's a good way of looking at it.

951
00:45:46,100 --> 00:45:48,500
Yeah, I would reimburse them.

952
00:45:48,500 --> 00:45:49,460
Here's a question, Griff.

953
00:45:49,460 --> 00:45:51,620
Do you think she should get the checkbook out

954
00:45:51,620 --> 00:45:53,460
and maybe try and meet him halfway on this?

955
00:45:53,460 --> 00:45:54,100
That's what I'm saying.

956
00:45:54,100 --> 00:45:58,180
It's worth to her $1,000 for her not to go through this.

957
00:45:59,060 --> 00:46:01,860
Okay, so she should say like, hold on, let me cover that for you.

958
00:46:01,860 --> 00:46:04,980
Yeah, let me go ahead and get that tick and talk to you never.

959
00:46:06,500 --> 00:46:07,700
Oh man, that's brutal.

960
00:46:08,260 --> 00:46:10,420
Yeah, because if you tell them in advance enough,

961
00:46:11,060 --> 00:46:12,900
maybe he could sell it on Craigslist or something.

962
00:46:12,900 --> 00:46:14,100
Do they have Craigslist there?

963
00:46:14,100 --> 00:46:15,780
Of course they do, they have to.

964
00:46:15,780 --> 00:46:17,380
Sell it on Craigslist or something.

965
00:46:17,380 --> 00:46:18,820
Sell it on Lord's Craigslist.

966
00:46:20,900 --> 00:46:22,660
The Craigslist of Davenshire.

967
00:46:24,100 --> 00:46:25,700
Yeah, you guys are right.

968
00:46:25,700 --> 00:46:28,420
I was in the wrong at the beginning of this.

969
00:46:30,340 --> 00:46:31,460
You can't go through with this.

970
00:46:31,460 --> 00:46:32,100
Here's the thing.

971
00:46:32,100 --> 00:46:34,500
What you're probably trying to solve,

972
00:46:34,500 --> 00:46:38,660
person asking this question, is the good way to do it.

973
00:46:38,660 --> 00:46:40,420
There is no good way to do it.

974
00:46:40,420 --> 00:46:44,340
No, that's the thing is like you could contort yourself

975
00:46:44,340 --> 00:46:47,700
into something that you think is the most decent, right?

976
00:46:47,700 --> 00:46:49,460
Like it's probably the most decent to,

977
00:46:49,460 --> 00:46:52,500
depending on how long term this relationship is,

978
00:46:52,500 --> 00:46:55,860
it's probably the most decent to like end it face to face, right?

979
00:46:55,860 --> 00:46:58,580
But at the same time, you could kill yourself

980
00:46:58,580 --> 00:47:00,740
to try to make that happen.

981
00:47:00,740 --> 00:47:05,300
But in the end, it's still gonna be the dude got dumped.

982
00:47:05,300 --> 00:47:06,740
I mean, he's not gonna think that.

983
00:47:06,740 --> 00:47:09,540
Got dumped in a foreign country while he stuck with you

984
00:47:09,540 --> 00:47:11,860
with like no other mode of transportation

985
00:47:11,860 --> 00:47:14,100
or place to hang out or anywhere to go.

986
00:47:14,100 --> 00:47:15,380
He can't be away from you.

987
00:47:16,740 --> 00:47:18,660
And you are gonna tell him before he makes the trip.

988
00:47:18,660 --> 00:47:22,740
You are going to permanently injure his opinion of America.

989
00:47:23,380 --> 00:47:25,380
If you do that, whenever he thinks of America,

990
00:47:25,380 --> 00:47:26,980
he's gonna think of the heartbreak.

991
00:47:26,980 --> 00:47:28,180
And we don't need more bad press.

992
00:47:28,180 --> 00:47:29,460
Heartbreak in the heartlands.

993
00:47:29,460 --> 00:47:31,860
I want people to think of hamburgers and John Cena.

994
00:47:32,980 --> 00:47:34,340
And Cena burgers.

995
00:47:34,340 --> 00:47:37,060
Like if you tell him that he shouldn't come,

996
00:47:37,620 --> 00:47:40,740
then he really shouldn't have any problem.

997
00:47:40,740 --> 00:47:44,100
I mean, like basically isn't a ticket to America

998
00:47:44,100 --> 00:47:46,500
like the most valuable thing you can get?

999
00:47:46,500 --> 00:47:48,020
Like there are people in Mexico

1000
00:47:48,020 --> 00:47:49,300
that would kill for a ticket to America.

1001
00:47:49,300 --> 00:47:49,700
Yeah, right?

1002
00:47:50,740 --> 00:47:53,060
It's like a fucking Willy Wonka golden ticket.

1003
00:47:53,060 --> 00:47:55,620
Right, you come over here, we're gonna get you set up.

1004
00:47:55,620 --> 00:47:58,420
We're gonna take you to the Cenaplex and we're gonna-

1005
00:47:59,300 --> 00:48:00,820
We're gonna eat Cena burgers.

1006
00:48:00,820 --> 00:48:02,820
I imagine Cena burgers come,

1007
00:48:02,820 --> 00:48:05,300
it's two burgers that come in a pair of jorts.

1008
00:48:07,060 --> 00:48:09,140
Like a Happy Meal, but instead of a box.

1009
00:48:09,140 --> 00:48:10,660
Those jorts are made of french fries?

1010
00:48:10,660 --> 00:48:12,820
Sure, if we want to go there.

1011
00:48:12,820 --> 00:48:15,220
They would lose the gene quality.

1012
00:48:16,820 --> 00:48:18,580
They're dyed blue, they're made of blue corn.

1013
00:48:18,580 --> 00:48:19,940
Blue corn french fries.

1014
00:48:19,940 --> 00:48:21,380
I just want you guys to know that in my mind,

1015
00:48:21,380 --> 00:48:23,220
as we've been talking about John Cena,

1016
00:48:23,220 --> 00:48:26,420
I've been pronouncing it in my head as John Zena

1017
00:48:26,420 --> 00:48:27,620
and it makes me a lot happier.

1018
00:48:27,620 --> 00:48:28,820
Okay, you can do it.

1019
00:48:28,820 --> 00:48:30,180
Sure, you can go down that.

1020
00:48:30,180 --> 00:48:30,420
Yeah.

1021
00:48:30,420 --> 00:48:31,540
Go down that blind alley.

1022
00:48:32,180 --> 00:48:33,700
I feel like we've helped this person enough.

1023
00:48:33,700 --> 00:48:35,140
Can we jump to a Yahoo?

1024
00:48:35,140 --> 00:48:37,540
Yeah, yeah, we helped him like a wicked lot.

1025
00:48:38,100 --> 00:48:39,460
This one was sent in by Jacob Locker.

1026
00:48:39,460 --> 00:48:40,020
Thank you, Jacob.

1027
00:48:40,020 --> 00:48:42,420
It's by Yahoo Answers user Marcus who asks,

1028
00:48:43,060 --> 00:48:45,940
is it true that the Olive Garden is for poor people?

1029
00:48:48,180 --> 00:48:50,100
My girlfriend said it was

1030
00:48:50,100 --> 00:48:51,540
and didn't want us to go there last night.

1031
00:48:51,540 --> 00:48:53,620
She's a rich girl and knows what fine food is,

1032
00:48:53,620 --> 00:48:58,980
but we've never even ever been in there before.

1033
00:48:58,980 --> 00:49:01,540
So how does she know it is such a low quality place?

1034
00:49:06,100 --> 00:49:07,860
This is a sticky subject.

1035
00:49:07,860 --> 00:49:10,660
Yeah, Justin, didn't you sign an NDA

1036
00:49:10,660 --> 00:49:12,420
when you stopped working at the Olive Garden?

1037
00:49:12,420 --> 00:49:16,580
Yeah, as a former line chef at the Olive Garden,

1038
00:49:16,580 --> 00:49:18,660
I think I might have to recuse myself from this question

1039
00:49:18,660 --> 00:49:24,740
because I can't say anything negative about the OG.

1040
00:49:26,900 --> 00:49:29,860
For an entire three and a half weeks, that was my home.

1041
00:49:29,860 --> 00:49:33,860
Can I just say that as somebody who shared a house with you

1042
00:49:33,860 --> 00:49:36,020
while you were an OG line cook,

1043
00:49:36,020 --> 00:49:38,420
whenever you came home from that job,

1044
00:49:38,420 --> 00:49:40,740
you kind of smelled like a poor person.

1045
00:49:40,740 --> 00:49:42,820
I did.

1046
00:49:42,820 --> 00:49:48,740
I got soaked in what was colloquially referred to as OG water,

1047
00:49:48,740 --> 00:49:52,100
which was the, nevermind, I don't want to ruin the Olive Garden.

1048
00:49:52,100 --> 00:49:54,420
Tell me the OG water story today.

1049
00:49:56,420 --> 00:49:58,420
Well, at the end of the night,

1050
00:49:58,420 --> 00:50:02,260
the floor was coated in squished garlic and noodles

1051
00:50:02,260 --> 00:50:03,860
that had fallen to the ground.

1052
00:50:03,860 --> 00:50:06,020
So you would have to get on your hands and knees

1053
00:50:06,020 --> 00:50:07,380
and hose off the floor.

1054
00:50:07,380 --> 00:50:09,940
Why did you have to get on your hands and knees to do it?

1055
00:50:09,940 --> 00:50:13,060
Well, to get underneath the breadstick oven.

1056
00:50:14,100 --> 00:50:16,660
So you would spray the floor off

1057
00:50:16,660 --> 00:50:19,060
and you would get kind of soaked in OG water.

1058
00:50:19,060 --> 00:50:20,580
Oh, fuck.

1059
00:50:20,580 --> 00:50:25,620
And your whole clothes would smell like hobo garlic.

1060
00:50:25,620 --> 00:50:27,380
And it was a nightmare.

1061
00:50:27,380 --> 00:50:31,700
I would say that if eating pounds and pounds

1062
00:50:31,700 --> 00:50:34,500
of unlimited breadsticks and bottomless pasta pits

1063
00:50:34,500 --> 00:50:37,380
is for poor people, I don't want to be rich.

1064
00:50:37,380 --> 00:50:38,340
Amen.

1065
00:50:38,340 --> 00:50:40,660
I did that gross thing that I just described

1066
00:50:40,660 --> 00:50:42,740
and you put a plate of chicken scampi in front of me,

1067
00:50:42,740 --> 00:50:44,340
you better believe I'm going to town.

1068
00:50:44,340 --> 00:50:45,220
That's what I'm saying.

1069
00:50:45,220 --> 00:50:46,580
Gonna hurt that bad boy.

1070
00:50:46,580 --> 00:50:49,940
Just gonna carb up, face the day.

1071
00:50:49,940 --> 00:50:50,980
Take a run.

1072
00:50:50,980 --> 00:50:53,300
But mathematically speaking, though,

1073
00:50:53,300 --> 00:50:58,580
the Olive Garden offers you infinite food for like $3.25.

1074
00:50:58,580 --> 00:51:00,500
So yes, I would say mathematically,

1075
00:51:00,500 --> 00:51:02,340
I would say mathematically speaking,

1076
00:51:02,340 --> 00:51:05,300
it is indeed ideal for poor people.

1077
00:51:05,300 --> 00:51:06,020
Right.

1078
00:51:06,020 --> 00:51:08,420
It's a pretty sweet scene for the poor folk.

1079
00:51:09,220 --> 00:51:11,060
It's for the people who are too uppity

1080
00:51:11,060 --> 00:51:13,220
to eat the pasta at Golden Corral.

1081
00:51:13,220 --> 00:51:14,100
Right, exactly.

1082
00:51:14,100 --> 00:51:19,460
And they think too much of themselves to get down on some,

1083
00:51:19,460 --> 00:51:20,340
what do they have there?

1084
00:51:20,340 --> 00:51:21,380
Like beef on a hook.

1085
00:51:22,900 --> 00:51:24,500
They don't want to eat the hook beef.

1086
00:51:24,500 --> 00:51:26,900
No, you just gnaw on it with a bunch of people.

1087
00:51:26,900 --> 00:51:31,460
Pulling up to the Golden Corral.

1088
00:51:31,460 --> 00:51:33,860
Darrell, make me a spot on the beef hook.

1089
00:51:35,140 --> 00:51:37,780
You cover it with a nondescript gray sauce.

1090
00:51:40,100 --> 00:51:45,140
Yahoo answers user coconut guy responded.

1091
00:51:45,700 --> 00:51:48,420
Olive Garden are for all kinds of people.

1092
00:51:48,420 --> 00:51:50,740
Everyone with all sorts of different incomes

1093
00:51:50,740 --> 00:51:52,500
go there and dine to enjoy

1094
00:51:52,500 --> 00:51:54,340
and just have a good time eating there.

1095
00:51:54,340 --> 00:51:56,740
Hope that helps.

1096
00:51:57,620 --> 00:51:59,220
Oh, it helps tremendously.

1097
00:51:59,220 --> 00:52:01,060
It's such a big help.

1098
00:52:01,940 --> 00:52:04,180
They go there, they dine to enjoy.

1099
00:52:04,820 --> 00:52:05,540
Come.

1100
00:52:05,540 --> 00:52:05,860
Nobody.

1101
00:52:05,860 --> 00:52:07,940
You know who I bet eats at the Olive Garden?

1102
00:52:09,060 --> 00:52:10,500
Dwayne The Rock Johnson.

1103
00:52:10,500 --> 00:52:11,700
Bet he's not too big.

1104
00:52:11,700 --> 00:52:12,740
Not too proud.

1105
00:52:12,740 --> 00:52:14,180
Well, he's too big to fit through the door.

1106
00:52:14,180 --> 00:52:15,540
They have to like feed him outside,

1107
00:52:15,540 --> 00:52:17,620
but he's a man of the people.

1108
00:52:18,500 --> 00:52:20,740
I got some of the people's pasta on the people's elbow.

1109
00:52:20,740 --> 00:52:24,260
I have a few problems with this guy's response.

1110
00:52:24,260 --> 00:52:25,700
Okay.

1111
00:52:25,700 --> 00:52:26,980
The most glaring of which being that

1112
00:52:26,980 --> 00:52:30,100
I don't think anyone has ever gone to the Olive Garden

1113
00:52:30,100 --> 00:52:31,940
to quote, have a good time eating there.

1114
00:52:32,580 --> 00:52:33,540
I think they go there

1115
00:52:33,540 --> 00:52:35,700
because they want to make a pasta mistake.

1116
00:52:38,100 --> 00:52:39,540
Or more likely,

1117
00:52:39,540 --> 00:52:42,260
it's the only place you can get your grandparents to go.

1118
00:52:42,900 --> 00:52:43,460
Yeah.

1119
00:52:43,460 --> 00:52:45,700
That's the only place they love is the Olive Gardens.

1120
00:52:45,700 --> 00:52:46,820
You go there with them.

1121
00:52:46,820 --> 00:52:48,340
Hey, Pap Pap and Gam Gam,

1122
00:52:48,340 --> 00:52:49,620
remember the old country?

1123
00:52:49,620 --> 00:52:50,740
This is basically like that.

1124
00:52:50,740 --> 00:52:52,420
Let's go get endless breadsticks.

1125
00:52:52,420 --> 00:52:54,340
Let's go eat pasta until we die.

1126
00:52:54,340 --> 00:52:55,140
And then, but don't worry,

1127
00:52:55,140 --> 00:52:56,420
because they have wine you can drink

1128
00:52:56,420 --> 00:52:57,620
to forget the pasta pain.

1129
00:52:59,220 --> 00:53:02,100
Anytime that I've ever gone to Olive Garden

1130
00:53:02,100 --> 00:53:03,860
that hasn't been prompted by family,

1131
00:53:03,860 --> 00:53:04,820
it's always been,

1132
00:53:05,620 --> 00:53:07,140
I've always done carry out.

1133
00:53:07,140 --> 00:53:08,580
Like, I don't want anybody to know.

1134
00:53:08,580 --> 00:53:11,780
I'll slip in there in my jorts and a mask

1135
00:53:11,780 --> 00:53:17,460
and just get a big bag of pasta and leave.

1136
00:53:17,460 --> 00:53:18,660
The mental image.

1137
00:53:19,380 --> 00:53:21,060
Like, I still pay for it.

1138
00:53:21,060 --> 00:53:22,580
It's not like a robbery.

1139
00:53:22,580 --> 00:53:23,860
It's a pasta robbery.

1140
00:53:23,860 --> 00:53:24,820
When you said mask,

1141
00:53:24,820 --> 00:53:27,380
I imagined like a feathered masquerade mask.

1142
00:53:27,380 --> 00:53:29,460
See, I picture a luchadora mask.

1143
00:53:30,420 --> 00:53:32,020
I wish it was that dramatic.

1144
00:53:33,940 --> 00:53:34,900
No, it's just, you know,

1145
00:53:34,900 --> 00:53:39,380
like a regular inside out William Shatner mask on Halloween.

1146
00:53:40,340 --> 00:53:41,620
Something for the kids.

1147
00:53:41,620 --> 00:53:42,820
Keep things lively.

1148
00:53:42,820 --> 00:53:45,860
But I think that if you get to a point

1149
00:53:46,820 --> 00:53:50,100
where you, I don't think any restaurant is like,

1150
00:53:50,100 --> 00:53:52,020
like, oh, I'm not going to go there

1151
00:53:52,020 --> 00:53:53,060
because it's only for poor people.

1152
00:53:53,060 --> 00:53:54,820
Like, I think that's kind of despicable.

1153
00:53:54,820 --> 00:53:56,580
And if I try to make those barriers for myself

1154
00:53:56,580 --> 00:53:58,340
living in Huntington, West Virginia,

1155
00:53:58,340 --> 00:54:00,500
I would not be able to eat out a lot,

1156
00:54:00,500 --> 00:54:03,460
which for the health spectrum

1157
00:54:03,460 --> 00:54:05,620
might not be the worst thing in the world.

1158
00:54:05,620 --> 00:54:07,620
But I think that the important thing

1159
00:54:07,620 --> 00:54:11,140
is just to know sort of where that restaurant fits

1160
00:54:11,940 --> 00:54:13,220
in the world.

1161
00:54:13,220 --> 00:54:15,300
Like, sort of like, what is the level of,

1162
00:54:16,660 --> 00:54:18,340
you know, what is the level of food here?

1163
00:54:18,340 --> 00:54:20,820
What is the level of quality you're opening yourself up to?

1164
00:54:21,460 --> 00:54:23,940
And sort of like, where does that fit?

1165
00:54:23,940 --> 00:54:26,980
What's the Zagats on Olive Garden?

1166
00:54:26,980 --> 00:54:27,780
Did you Yelp it?

1167
00:54:28,500 --> 00:54:29,700
Did you Yelp this OG?

1168
00:54:30,980 --> 00:54:33,300
I would say this, just as a last piece of advice.

1169
00:54:34,420 --> 00:54:38,660
I do not necessarily daily crave the Olive Garden.

1170
00:54:38,660 --> 00:54:40,180
But if I was dating a girl who,

1171
00:54:40,180 --> 00:54:41,620
when I brought up the Olive Garden,

1172
00:54:41,620 --> 00:54:43,220
said that's for poor people,

1173
00:54:43,940 --> 00:54:46,100
I would immediately dump her.

1174
00:54:46,100 --> 00:54:48,580
It is not a good relationship you're in, sir.

1175
00:54:49,380 --> 00:54:51,220
That restaurant, that's for the rabble.

1176
00:54:52,100 --> 00:54:53,460
That's for the commoners?

1177
00:54:54,020 --> 00:54:55,380
I'd rather go to Denny's.

1178
00:54:55,380 --> 00:54:57,860
I only eat at the spaghetti factory.

1179
00:54:57,860 --> 00:54:59,780
Are there any restaurants, be honest,

1180
00:54:59,780 --> 00:55:01,780
are there any restaurants that you guys won't go to

1181
00:55:01,780 --> 00:55:03,380
because it's just too low quality?

1182
00:55:03,380 --> 00:55:03,860
Nope.

1183
00:55:03,860 --> 00:55:05,460
The food's for poor people.

1184
00:55:05,460 --> 00:55:07,380
You know me too well to ask that.

1185
00:55:07,380 --> 00:55:08,500
The answer is nope.

1186
00:55:09,860 --> 00:55:12,660
In fact, if they have large quantities of food for very cheap,

1187
00:55:12,660 --> 00:55:14,340
like, I mean, I'll go to CC's Pizza.

1188
00:55:14,340 --> 00:55:17,220
I ain't above it.

1189
00:55:17,220 --> 00:55:19,460
Just to take things a little serious for a second,

1190
00:55:19,460 --> 00:55:20,580
but not too serious,

1191
00:55:20,580 --> 00:55:21,780
because we'll come up the other end.

1192
00:55:22,980 --> 00:55:26,100
The last time that we all went to Golden Corral

1193
00:55:26,100 --> 00:55:30,420
was the first Christmas Eve after our mother passed away.

1194
00:55:30,420 --> 00:55:33,300
We decided that's the time we've got to get in there

1195
00:55:33,300 --> 00:55:34,740
and not on the beef hook.

1196
00:55:34,740 --> 00:55:39,380
That's going to turn us around on Christmas.

1197
00:55:39,380 --> 00:55:41,460
We were like, we'll go out to dinner for Christmas

1198
00:55:41,460 --> 00:55:44,340
and didn't think of the fact that it's fucking Christmas

1199
00:55:44,340 --> 00:55:47,220
and everybody in their right mind is closed.

1200
00:55:47,220 --> 00:55:48,180
Like, everybody's closed,

1201
00:55:48,180 --> 00:55:50,180
so there's one place that's open.

1202
00:55:50,180 --> 00:55:52,100
Motherfucking Golden Corral.

1203
00:55:52,100 --> 00:55:52,980
Well, don't worry, guys,

1204
00:55:52,980 --> 00:55:56,260
because it was the closest restaurant to the cemetery

1205
00:55:56,260 --> 00:55:57,220
we had just visited.

1206
00:55:57,220 --> 00:55:57,860
Oh, God, no.

1207
00:55:57,860 --> 00:55:59,540
Pretty good choice, Golden Corral.

1208
00:56:00,100 --> 00:56:02,580
How much does this restaurant cost to eat at?

1209
00:56:02,580 --> 00:56:03,460
Everything.

1210
00:56:03,460 --> 00:56:05,380
Do you want to know the saddest part?

1211
00:56:05,380 --> 00:56:07,380
We weren't the only ones there.

1212
00:56:07,380 --> 00:56:08,500
Oh, whatever.

1213
00:56:08,500 --> 00:56:10,180
That beach was full of people.

1214
00:56:10,180 --> 00:56:13,140
It was full of people getting their holiday nosh on.

1215
00:56:13,140 --> 00:56:15,860
None of them were quite as in good spirits as us.

1216
00:56:16,500 --> 00:56:17,940
Nobody made eye contact.

1217
00:56:17,940 --> 00:56:19,140
Nobody made eye contact.

1218
00:56:20,180 --> 00:56:22,420
But you could tell the holiday magic was there

1219
00:56:22,420 --> 00:56:24,660
because a boy would come up to the beef hook

1220
00:56:24,660 --> 00:56:27,220
and a man would like scoot over a little bit.

1221
00:56:27,220 --> 00:56:28,180
Come on, Junior.

1222
00:56:28,740 --> 00:56:29,460
Come on.

1223
00:56:29,460 --> 00:56:30,660
Get on in here.

1224
00:56:30,660 --> 00:56:31,700
Wash your hands.

1225
00:56:31,700 --> 00:56:33,620
I've already gotten through the pre-gristle.

1226
00:56:35,220 --> 00:56:36,900
Really tuck into the meat.

1227
00:56:36,900 --> 00:56:38,340
All those boys over there,

1228
00:56:38,340 --> 00:56:40,100
they just made a terrible life choice.

1229
00:56:41,860 --> 00:56:43,940
They probably could have made spaghetti at home or something.

1230
00:56:44,980 --> 00:56:46,500
Just slosh your sauce.

1231
00:56:46,500 --> 00:56:48,100
Encounter blessings.

1232
00:56:48,100 --> 00:56:48,900
And do the squirge.

1233
00:56:52,900 --> 00:56:53,860
Oh, man.

1234
00:56:53,860 --> 00:56:59,780
I wonder if Soapy Tears saw that depressing, depressing shit

1235
00:56:59,780 --> 00:57:00,340
we were going to do.

1236
00:57:00,340 --> 00:57:04,740
It was so depressing that he knew back in the 50s

1237
00:57:04,740 --> 00:57:06,100
that we were going to do it.

1238
00:57:06,100 --> 00:57:07,700
He predicted the existence of Olive Garden

1239
00:57:07,700 --> 00:57:11,300
thanks to our depressing, terrible choices.

1240
00:57:11,300 --> 00:57:14,500
That's the thing about being in a depressing situation, guys.

1241
00:57:14,500 --> 00:57:15,220
And remember this.

1242
00:57:16,420 --> 00:57:18,500
Most of the time, you could have avoided it.

1243
00:57:18,500 --> 00:57:19,620
No matter what the depress-

1244
00:57:19,620 --> 00:57:20,900
It's all your fault.

1245
00:57:20,900 --> 00:57:21,860
It's all your fault.

1246
00:57:21,860 --> 00:57:24,900
You went to England, you flew over from England

1247
00:57:24,900 --> 00:57:26,180
and your girlfriend depressed you

1248
00:57:26,180 --> 00:57:28,900
and you're walking around all sad like that one scene

1249
00:57:28,900 --> 00:57:31,380
in Ernest Goes to Camp where he-

1250
00:57:31,380 --> 00:57:32,580
He's crying in the window.

1251
00:57:32,580 --> 00:57:33,460
Crying in the window.

1252
00:57:33,460 --> 00:57:35,700
Yeah, you could have avoided it

1253
00:57:35,700 --> 00:57:38,340
if you just asked her like, are you feeling like you maybe

1254
00:57:38,340 --> 00:57:39,780
want to break out with us?

1255
00:57:39,780 --> 00:57:42,580
Just so I know before I purchase this very expensive,

1256
00:57:42,580 --> 00:57:44,180
non-refundable ticket.

1257
00:57:44,180 --> 00:57:45,380
We're good, right?

1258
00:57:45,380 --> 00:57:45,860
We're good.

1259
00:57:46,500 --> 00:57:47,380
I feel like we're good.

1260
00:57:48,580 --> 00:57:49,700
Well, that is our show.

1261
00:57:51,220 --> 00:57:54,020
Thank you guys so much for listening again.

1262
00:57:54,020 --> 00:57:56,100
This has been, what, 95 episodes?

1263
00:57:56,100 --> 00:57:57,060
Ah, fuck.

1264
00:57:57,060 --> 00:57:58,340
We better figure something out.

1265
00:57:59,140 --> 00:58:03,540
Gotta do something big for our Hundo episode.

1266
00:58:03,540 --> 00:58:05,620
But seriously, no BS.

1267
00:58:06,180 --> 00:58:08,820
Thank you guys so much for being with us.

1268
00:58:08,820 --> 00:58:12,660
You're the most supportive, coolest, funniest community

1269
00:58:12,660 --> 00:58:14,900
of people on the entire internet

1270
00:58:14,900 --> 00:58:18,020
and you make every day worthwhile.

1271
00:58:19,140 --> 00:58:21,700
Thank you for supporting Stacked Soap

1272
00:58:21,700 --> 00:58:23,780
even though I think you might have overdone a little bit.

1273
00:58:23,780 --> 00:58:26,020
Thank you for creating the soap juggernaut.

1274
00:58:26,020 --> 00:58:28,180
This soap, this new force in soap.

1275
00:58:29,780 --> 00:58:30,660
Something we don't talk about a lot,

1276
00:58:30,660 --> 00:58:31,860
we got a Facebook group.

1277
00:58:31,860 --> 00:58:34,180
If you go to Facebook, search for My Brother and My Brother and Me,

1278
00:58:34,900 --> 00:58:38,260
you'll see thousands of people talking about the show,

1279
00:58:40,340 --> 00:58:44,180
swapping pictures, goofy observations, zingers.

1280
00:58:45,460 --> 00:58:46,900
That's all going on there.

1281
00:58:46,900 --> 00:58:48,740
So go join up to that group.

1282
00:58:48,740 --> 00:58:52,820
And if you join, you have to be hand approved by me, Travis, or Griffin

1283
00:58:52,820 --> 00:58:54,180
so you know that it's like...

1284
00:58:54,180 --> 00:58:55,380
So bask in it.

1285
00:58:55,380 --> 00:58:56,100
Bask in it.

1286
00:58:56,100 --> 00:58:57,140
Meaningful and special.

1287
00:58:57,140 --> 00:58:58,100
Also, it's coming up.

1288
00:58:58,100 --> 00:58:59,380
It's that time of year.

1289
00:58:59,380 --> 00:59:02,900
Coming up is our MaximumFun.org fun drive.

1290
00:59:03,860 --> 00:59:08,180
And once a year, we're going to put out some extra long episodes,

1291
00:59:08,740 --> 00:59:12,100
give you a chance to help support all the MaxFun shows that you love.

1292
00:59:12,100 --> 00:59:15,060
We're going to be giving away extra content,

1293
00:59:15,700 --> 00:59:17,940
some gifts and stuff if you donate.

1294
00:59:17,940 --> 00:59:19,060
It's going to be a good time.

1295
00:59:19,060 --> 00:59:20,020
So make sure you check it out.

1296
00:59:20,020 --> 00:59:22,660
I think that starts the 26th, March 26th.

1297
00:59:22,660 --> 00:59:23,060
Yeah.

1298
00:59:23,060 --> 00:59:23,220
Yeah?

1299
00:59:23,220 --> 00:59:23,780
Yeah.

1300
00:59:23,780 --> 00:59:24,020
Yeah.

1301
00:59:24,020 --> 00:59:25,700
And then runs for two weeks.

1302
00:59:25,700 --> 00:59:29,620
So make sure to get on board and help support the shows that you love.

1303
00:59:29,620 --> 00:59:32,260
If you don't want to wait for that, you can go to MaxFunStore.com

1304
00:59:32,260 --> 00:59:33,780
and we got t-shirts there.

1305
00:59:33,780 --> 00:59:35,940
Two different styles that you can buy.

1306
00:59:37,300 --> 00:59:42,420
We got the blue, cool, sort of Hardy Boys, Vertigo inspired,

1307
00:59:42,420 --> 00:59:43,620
My Brother, My Brother, Me t-shirt,

1308
00:59:43,620 --> 00:59:46,980
and there's a Peabam's Nasty Gum shirt that you can get.

1309
00:59:47,620 --> 00:59:49,620
I want to thank John Roderick and the Long Winters

1310
00:59:49,620 --> 00:59:51,060
for the use of our theme song, It's a Departure,

1311
00:59:51,060 --> 00:59:52,580
off the album, Putting the Days to Bed.

1312
00:59:52,580 --> 00:59:55,620
Just go get, just go get it, go get it.

1313
00:59:55,620 --> 00:59:57,460
And no, we're telling you to buy a lot of things this week,

1314
00:59:57,460 --> 01:00:00,500
but it's, it is imperative that you get.

1315
01:00:00,500 --> 01:00:02,980
Also, if you have some soap that you would like to hock

1316
01:00:02,980 --> 01:00:06,020
or any other soap related ideas,

1317
01:00:06,020 --> 01:00:08,020
then you too can have a Jumbotron on the show

1318
01:00:08,020 --> 01:00:09,060
and have us talk about your product

1319
01:00:09,060 --> 01:00:10,900
or wish somebody like happy birthday

1320
01:00:10,900 --> 01:00:12,740
or congratulations on something.

1321
01:00:12,740 --> 01:00:16,340
Just go to Maximumfun.org slash Jumbotron

1322
01:00:16,340 --> 01:00:17,460
and follow the steps there.

1323
01:00:17,460 --> 01:00:19,300
And you can have a message on our show

1324
01:00:19,300 --> 01:00:20,660
or any other Max Fun show.

1325
01:00:20,660 --> 01:00:23,220

So if you want to tweet about the show

1335
01:00:54,340 --> 01:00:55,540
with the MBM hashtag,

01:00:55,540 --> 01:00:58,100
maybe throw a link to our sampler in there.

1337
01:00:58,100 --> 01:01:00,340
It's bit.ly forward slash it's MBMBAM.

1338
01:01:01,300 --> 01:01:02,980
That's a great way to sort of spread the word

1339
01:01:03,620 --> 01:01:04,260
about the show.

1340
01:01:05,780 --> 01:01:08,420
This final Yahoo answer was sent in by Keith Marnock.

1341
01:01:08,420 --> 01:01:09,060
Thank you, Keith.

1342
01:01:09,780 --> 01:01:12,420
It's about Yahoo Answers user, Janney, who asked,

1343
01:01:12,420 --> 01:01:17,460
What does an owl look like and why?

1344
01:01:22,100 --> 01:01:22,980
I'm Travis McElroy.

1345
01:01:22,980 --> 01:01:24,500
I'm Griffin McElroy.

1346
01:01:24,500 --> 01:01:25,860
It's been my brother, my brother and me.

1347
01:01:25,860 --> 01:01:26,500
Kiss your dad.

1348
01:01:26,500 --> 01:01:44,900
Score on the lips.
