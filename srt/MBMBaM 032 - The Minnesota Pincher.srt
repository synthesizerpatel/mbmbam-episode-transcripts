1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there will know how cool they are for listening.

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:33,000
If you change your mind, I'm the first in line. Honey, I'm still free, take a chance on me. If you need me, let me know, I'm gonna be around.

6
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:44,000
If you got no place to go, when you're feeling down. If you're all alone, when the pretty birds have flown.

7
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Every day is a gift, and on this particular Monday, you've opened up the gift, and what have you found inside? Ah yes, it's wisdom.

8
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:58,000
It's my brother, my brother and me. It's an advice show for the modern era.

9
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
I didn't want wisdom, I wanted bop it.

10
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:07,000
I got you bop it on the two day delivery that will be here tomorrow.

11
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
You always say that, I never believe you.

12
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,000
No, bop it will be.

13
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
You always say bop it, and it never comes.

14
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I got you bop it and a p touch labeler, and you're ruining Christmas right now.

15
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,000
And I don't want that bullshit bop it with the extra shit like flick it and spin it.

16
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,000
I want the original twist pull and bop.

17
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,000
I only need the three commands, you know what I'm saying?

18
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,000
That was my bad.

19
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:33,000
I got you mop it, which was a different game altogether and much more unpleasant.

20
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Yeah, don't try and sneak chores in there, because I'm cognizant.

21
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,000
You're pretty savvy about that. How did you get so savvy, Griffin?

22
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Well, by listening to advice shows like ours.

23
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,000
But not like ours, just ours.

24
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Just by listening to our show.

25
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Exactly ours.

26
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Just ours, it's a list of one, and it's this one.

27
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Let's make another one so someone else can avoid chores.

28
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Cool.

29
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:05,000
My name is Justin McElroy, by the way. I'm the oldest McElroy brother.

30
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:09,000
I'm Travis McElroy, and I am the middlest McElroy brother.

31
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:13,000
I'm Griffin McElroy, and I'm the youngest McElroy brother,

32
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:18,000
now that Tony, who was younger than me, totally died.

33
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Stupid Tony. It's a tractor.

34
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
I fucking hated that guy.

35
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
I hate Tony.

36
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Bye, Tony McElroy. You are not missed.

37
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Mr. Link.

38
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
I'm glad you're dead.

39
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
I'm glad you're dead.

40
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Stupid.

41
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,000
He's the one who broke my original bop it.

42
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Fucking douchebag.

43
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,000
That's why you killed him, with a tractor.

44
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Bye, Tony.

45
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:43,000
I want to get my wife a great gift, but it's too expensive for me right now.

46
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Should I tell her what it is to show my intention, and hopefully she appreciates it?

47
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Chancing the loss of surprise if I were to eventually obtain said funds?

48
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Mr. Lingo. Gmail. Wait a minute.

49
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Is he saying, baby, Merry Christmas.

50
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,000
For Christmas, I got you the idea of a car.

51
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Is that what he's saying?

52
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,000
I got you this laser-printed off-copy of a car picture.

53
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
That's not a good idea.

54
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:10,000
The promise of a Prius.

55
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
It's a Prius promise.

56
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
That is right, right?

57
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:20,000
He picked out a gift, something he knows she would enjoy, but something he will not be purchasing.

58
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Is that what we're at?

59
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Because he lacks the fungible assets required to acquire said automobile, or whatever the thing is.

60
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
It may not be a car.

61
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,000
I'm assuming it is, though, because that's the greatest gift of all.

62
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Yeah.

63
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Transportation.

64
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Specifically a Prius.

65
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Mr. Lingo, I'd say don't do that.

66
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Yeah.

67
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Don't, like, wow, don't do that.

68
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:47,000
People appreciate the thought, definitely.

69
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:52,000
It is the thought that counts, but you cannot have just the thought and then give it up.

70
00:03:52,000 --> 00:04:02,000
This is, I mean, this is why credit cards and irresponsible bank loans were invented, right?

71
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:07,000
So that you could impress your wife and make her think that you have more money than you actually have.

72
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Right.

73
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,000
And then you just get buried beneath a giant mountain of debt.

74
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Yeah.

75
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Come get out of the debt mountain with me.

76
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Yeah.

77
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Come plant a flag at the, well, it wouldn't be the top, because that would mean you conquered the debt.

78
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
You're deep inside it.

79
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
You're deep, deep in it.

80
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
You're like a mull man.

81
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
You're like a debt mull man.

82
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:31,000
You're like James Franco in 127 hours, only, no, you literally have to cut your arm off.

83
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
That's a really good analogy, Griffin.

84
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Nailed it.

85
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:38,000
When you ask her if she'll appreciate it, of course she won't.

86
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:43,000
You went to absolutely no effort to do it.

87
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
I could do that.

88
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,000
I could walk up to anyone in the street and be like, I'm planning on getting you a car.

89
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
You're welcome.

90
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Merry Christmas.

91
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
It doesn't mean anything.

92
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Merry Christmas.

93
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Hey, Justin.

94
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Yeah.

95
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
It's just crushing, crushing debt.

96
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Yeah.

97
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Hey, Justin and Travis.

98
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Yeah.

99
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:03,000
I wanted to tell you guys, I know it's not, we got like another month before it's Christmas,

100
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:07,000
but I just wanted to let you guys know that I got both of you rocket ships.

101
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Whoa.

102
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
For Christmas.

103
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Really?

104
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Real rocket ships, not like toys either.

105
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
I'm talking about shits you can use to go into space.

106
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
That's banging.

107
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Thanks, Griff.

108
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Hey, no problem.

109
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Yeah.

110
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Do you have a picture of them or something that I can hold on to?

111
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
I can send you one.

112
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
I'll Google one at you later.

113
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Will they be here on the 25th, would you say?

114
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:36,000
It may take me a little while to, I've been doing some babysitting gigs on the side trying

115
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:40,000
to save up because the rocket ships are made out of gold.

116
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Oh, shit.

117
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Yeah.

118
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:47,000
It adds a little bit to that old MSRP, so I'm going to see what I can do.

119
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:52,000
I'll try and make your Christmas wishes come true, but they are high quality rocket ships.

120
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:57,500
Lingo, we're spending a little time joking around here because we literally cannot overstate

121
00:05:57,500 --> 00:06:01,000
the extent to which you should not do what you're talking about.

122
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:06,000
I would rather have someone hand me a $5 bill than promise they're going to get me a car

123
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
in 20 years.

124
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Yeah.

125
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:15,000
I would rather someone hand me a note that says, fuck you, because at least then there's

126
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
a story.

127
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,000
You won't believe what he did this year.

128
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:24,000
I mean, the thing that you're talking about is just sad.

129
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:29,000
I don't care if you're broke as broke, broke, broke.

130
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:34,000
You could be without money, you could have negative money, and you could still do something

131
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
that she would appreciate more than that.

132
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
You've got to take it back to the drawing board.

133
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:43,000
She would appreciate a coupon for one free back rub before you say, hey, I thought about

134
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:47,000
getting you something nice and I didn't.

135
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
It's not that he didn't.

136
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
He wants to.

137
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
He so desperately wants to.

138
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
I don't know, guys.

139
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:57,000
I wanted to get you something nice, but I couldn't.

140
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:05,000
I think I would rather have him, like if I was his beautiful, lovely wife and he offered

141
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:13,000
me the choice between this pine cone ashtray he made or a Prius in like three months, he's

142
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
going to hit me up with a Prius in three months.

143
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:18,000
I think I would rather have the Prius.

144
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,000
But he shouldn't tell her about it.

145
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:25,000
No, because when you spend a lot of money on expensive gifts, what you're doing is buying

146
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
a surprise.

147
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,000
You're buying that look of surprise on their face.

148
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Don't ruin that.

149
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:34,000
I mean, you're definitely going to get a look of surprise if you hand her a sheet of paper

150
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
that says, I'm going to buy you a car someday.

151
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
She will be surprised.

152
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:41,000
It's more going to be hurt, like a hurt look than a happy look.

153
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
It's the opposite of what you want on Christmas Day.

154
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:46,000
You should start telling her that you'll never buy her a car.

155
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:50,000
If you were hoping I'd get you a car, forget about it.

156
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Give her a piece of paper.

157
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:54,000
You've never done anything to deserve a car.

158
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Give her a piece of paper with a picture of a car that says never on it for Christmas.

159
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Then you're getting her a real surprise.

160
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Promise her the car for Christmas and then she'll be real surprised when she doesn't

161
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
get it.

162
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Surprise, I got you a pine cone ashtray.

163
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Surprise, I'm broke.

164
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Surprise, you could have chosen better.

165
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:20,000
It's like that Toyota commercial where the lady opens up her box and inside the box is

166
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,000
a giant ribbon like you would find around a car.

167
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Then the husband's like, hey, hey, come look outside.

168
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,000
She takes a giant ribbon that you would find on a car and she goes outside in the driveway

169
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
and there's a Prius sitting there.

170
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Only in this situation, she would go outside and there wouldn't be a car.

171
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
He'd be like, where are you going?

172
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
The ribbon is the gift.

173
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
It's a novelty size ribbon for you.

174
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
For you.

175
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Do whatever you want to with it.

176
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:51,000
I have another question for us from Gmail.

177
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
No sender on this.

178
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Make sure you tell us who you are when you send these in.

179
00:08:55,000 --> 00:09:01,000
How do I get my friends to stop referring to things as fire or raw when they are saying

180
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:04,000
something is cool or awesome?

181
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:09,000
I'm only a senior in high school, but I still don't think my friends should be talking like idiots.

182
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:13,000
And if you haven't heard these terms before in this way before, then maybe it's just a

183
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
South Florida thing regardless.

184
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Example.

185
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:25,000
Yo, this party is going to be so raw and hey, man, you should have seen it last night.

186
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Last night was pure fire.

187
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Dude, I have I have really wicked bad news for you.

188
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:40,000
You meant to ask for advice, but what you've done is proliferate these these two catch

189
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:45,000
phrases into your favorite podcast because you better believe I'm going to start saying

190
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:50,000
things are like fire or quite possibly raw every chance I get.

191
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:54,000
I think that calling things fire is pretty good.

192
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Yeah, yeah, because it's like, what was better than the invention of fire?

193
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Nothing.

194
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
Yep.

195
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Yep.

196
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
And raw food.

197
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Raw food is food that you can't touch with fire.

198
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Right.

199
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
So it's like the opposite.

200
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
It's like the antithesis.

201
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:14,000
I think these two things, they're using them as synonyms, but I think that they should

202
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:18,000
be used as an Antoine Ems.

203
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Antoine Ems.

204
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:25,000
The important thing whenever coming up, whenever you come up with new slang is where do you

205
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
use it?

206
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Where is it appropriate?

207
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
Because I don't think you could say a girl is raw.

208
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
I think that that's.

209
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Yeah, I don't think you should do that.

210
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:35,000
I don't think that's OK.

211
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
Like an orphanage is so fire.

212
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:40,000
That's not OK.

213
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:43,000
Yo, that's St. Jude's Medical Center.

214
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:50,000
It's raw.

215
00:10:50,000 --> 00:11:00,200
I think you can kill new terminology pretty quickly because I think it's so rare that

216
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:04,920
someone says, hey, that word you're using, it's not working.

217
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:08,840
I think if you tell your friends like, hey, it's not flying for you.

218
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:10,360
That's not working for you.

219
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:13,400
That word, it makes you sound silly.

220
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:17,440
That kind of direct approach may be the best thing.

221
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:18,440
Because another idea.

222
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:19,440
Oh, sorry.

223
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:20,440
Go on.

224
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:23,840
No, because a lot of times words get stuck in your head and you don't know where they

225
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:24,840
came from.

226
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:28,060
Maybe they came from my brother, my brother, me from an email from a guy from South Florida.

227
00:11:28,060 --> 00:11:33,540
And now you're saying everything's fire and raw shit is so fire.

228
00:11:33,540 --> 00:11:39,240
All you need to do is get his mom to start using them, get your friend's parents to start

229
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:43,600
using raw and fire and I guarantee they won't use it anymore.

230
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:45,480
Nailed it.

231
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:51,520
Can you guys remember any any colloquial terms that you that were popular when you were in

232
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:55,040
in high school that you, you know, didn't particularly care for?

233
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:58,320
You mean like stuffies?

234
00:11:58,320 --> 00:11:59,320
What is that?

235
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:00,320
Like that's good stuffies?

236
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:01,320
Oh, no.

237
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:06,560
That can't be a real thing.

238
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:09,400
Yeah, you guys said it, you assholes.

239
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:11,840
You got it stuck in my head.

240
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:12,840
I didn't mean to.

241
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:16,040
Yeah, I think for me, it was pussy town.

242
00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:21,120
I see something cool be like, Hey, did you go to the play last night?

243
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:22,120
Yeah, dog.

244
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:23,920
It was pussy town.

245
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:26,120
And I think that was that was like elementary school.

246
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:28,160
It was it was wildly inappropriate.

247
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:30,920
Yeah, it was not something kids should say.

248
00:12:30,920 --> 00:12:36,360
But you can't control like the spread of language, you know, you can't you you absolutely can't

249
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:37,680
control it.

250
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:40,480
We invented language the other way around.

251
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:42,440
It's because language is so fucking raw.

252
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:46,920
Oh, my God, it's raw and kind of fire, fire.

253
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:49,000
It's a little fire, right?

254
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,000
Not on fire.

255
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,320
It just is.

256
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:52,320
It is fire.

257
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:58,120
Hey, I have a Yahoo Answers question, please.

258
00:12:58,120 --> 00:13:00,400
This one was sent in by Louis dog.

259
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:02,300
Thanks, Louis dog.

260
00:13:02,300 --> 00:13:04,040
It's by Yahoo Answers user.

261
00:13:04,040 --> 00:13:05,040
Oh, shit.

262
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:06,440
I didn't even look at this before.

263
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:13,760
It's like four asterisks, and then like a space and then like nine asterisks.

264
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:17,400
So I'm sure there's a name in there somewhere, but I'm not going to try and decode it.

265
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:21,980
A bunch of asterisks asks, first bowling date.

266
00:13:21,980 --> 00:13:24,000
What to do?

267
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,240
We're both 14.

268
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:27,040
And we are going bowling this weekend.

269
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:28,120
We've already kissed.

270
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:30,880
And now she tells me that she is not very good at bowling.

271
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:32,520
What can I do?

272
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:34,240
What can I do with this information?

273
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:35,680
Do I just watch her try?

274
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:39,320
And if it's no good, say, let me help you and then guide her arm?

275
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:44,960
How can I be romantic and maybe be making out by the end?

276
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:52,840
To clarify, it is not our first date, just my first bowling date.

277
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:58,480
If you are caught making out in a bowling alley, you will be ejected.

278
00:13:58,480 --> 00:13:59,760
But you will be high fived.

279
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:05,480
There will be two lines of people high fiving you on either side as you leave the establishment.

280
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:09,400
They will all be toothless and terrible and awful people.

281
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:14,120
Have you guys ever heard of cutting a hole in the bottom of a popcorn bucket?

282
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:15,760
You could do that with a bowling ball.

283
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:19,720
It's going to take some flexibility, and it's going to take some dedication, and it's going

284
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:20,720
to take some butter.

285
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:22,320
But you are going to do it.

286
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:23,320
You're going to pull it off.

287
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:24,320
It will not.

288
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:26,320
It cannot feel good, though.

289
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:28,520
It will not be pleasurable.

290
00:14:28,520 --> 00:14:32,440
It will be raw and no, not like you're thinking.

291
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:37,480
Dig it, dig it deep in there, like stick your prick like right in the back of the bowling

292
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:40,920
ball, like on the opposite side of the three holes so that when she tucks her three fingers

293
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:44,800
in there, there's a chance she may graze.

294
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:51,000
She puts her two fingers and thumb in there, gives you a Minnesota pincher, and you are

295
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,000
off to the races.

296
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,000
Oh, man.

297
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:57,520
But it is so important that she realizes what you've done before she bowls.

298
00:14:57,520 --> 00:14:59,200
Oh, God.

299
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:02,600
You have got you've got to figure getting into the situation.

300
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:04,360
If you thought that was hard.

301
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:05,360
Try getting out of it.

302
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:06,360
It is.

303
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:07,360
Wow.

304
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:08,360
Maybe.

305
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:09,360
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

306
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:10,360
My dick's in the wall.

307
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:11,360
Yes, Travis.

308
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:16,360
That's what we were talking about.

309
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:20,440
No, but Travis does have a good point.

310
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:25,560
You need to be as clearly spoken as humanly possible.

311
00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:27,840
Very direct.

312
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:30,000
Because you know, maybe you made the hole too small.

313
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:34,360
Like maybe there's maybe there's a vacuum issue.

314
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:37,560
And if that's the case, then then I mean, you're going to have to make an embarrassing

315
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:42,440
trip to the emergency room, which maybe this tip is not a good idea for a first bowling

316
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:43,440
date.

317
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:48,240
I always say if you're going to stick your dick in a bowling ball to try and get a Minnesota

318
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:51,760
pincher, you've got to wait until at least bowling date number three.

319
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:52,760
Yeah, that's true.

320
00:15:52,760 --> 00:15:53,760
That's true.

321
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:56,320
It's about class and it's about decorum.

322
00:15:56,320 --> 00:16:00,560
You know, you wouldn't don't do anything you wouldn't do without her parents permission.

323
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:08,600
So make sure you ask host said if you're going to stick your dick to a bowling ball.

324
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:10,600
Also don't go on a bowling date.

325
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:15,400
I can't think of a single time I have ever taken a girl to a bowling alley and had it

326
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:18,520
not just be a fucking unmitigated night.

327
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:20,560
Can I tell you something I discovered about bowling girlfriend?

328
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:21,600
Maybe this will help you out.

329
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:26,480
I've discovered it over the years there.

330
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:32,920
The bowling that you grew up with thinking that it was what bowling really was.

331
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:37,520
It's not actually bowling real bowling is you have to be drunk.

332
00:16:37,520 --> 00:16:43,160
If you are drunk, then bowling finally makes sense because you're just sitting for a long

333
00:16:43,160 --> 00:16:47,720
time and then every once in a while you have reason to stand up and lob something heavy.

334
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:52,620
Like it's that's that's the whole bit and it makes no sense if you're sober.

335
00:16:52,620 --> 00:16:55,680
But if you've been drinking, yeah, OK, now I get it.

336
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:59,720
You don't care so much if the ball goes in the gutter.

337
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:00,720
You can't do that.

338
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:04,740
Are you playing with a dude who takes it way too seriously and has like a specialized glove

339
00:17:04,740 --> 00:17:09,320
and he kicks his foot out and like he's kind of an asshole and he gets over like 150.

340
00:17:09,320 --> 00:17:11,120
Yeah, no one likes that guy either.

341
00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:12,120
No, I don't like you.

342
00:17:12,120 --> 00:17:13,960
I'd rather be drunk and get 32.

343
00:17:13,960 --> 00:17:15,600
Hey, just don't go.

344
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:16,600
Don't go bowling.

345
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:18,360
And I just say no more bowling, no more.

346
00:17:18,360 --> 00:17:21,240
Can we bring back what's that?

347
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:25,280
What's that table bowling game where you have like the sand on the table and you have to

348
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:28,640
it's like shuffleboard, but it's not like on a table jar.

349
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:31,700
You know, I'm saying skeet, skeet, skeet, skeet, skeet, skeet.

350
00:17:31,700 --> 00:17:33,600
Let's bring skeet skeet back.

351
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:35,240
Let's have skeet skeet dates, everybody.

352
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:41,840
The super serious bowling reminded me, make sure you're really certain which bowling ball

353
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:46,400
is your girlfriend's, because wow, wow.

354
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:47,400
That can get weird.

355
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:51,440
Here's another one from Gmail.

356
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:53,160
There's a very pretty coworker I have.

357
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:55,980
We've been working together for almost three years and we get along pretty well.

358
00:17:55,980 --> 00:17:59,520
The other day she did something nice for me and when I said thank you, she said, she just

359
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:04,240
smirked and quipped, it's okay, you just owe me a beer now.

360
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:09,160
Should I take this as a hint or the friendly coworker banter that I just assumed it was?

361
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:13,080
I was never good at picking up hints, so this problem has been nagging at me for a while.

362
00:18:13,080 --> 00:18:15,320
Please keep up the good work, Eli.

363
00:18:15,320 --> 00:18:18,680
Oh, Eli.

364
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:21,600
What was the nice thing that she did for you?

365
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:27,200
Was it like she took care of a difficult customer or like she kept a refrigerator from crushing

366
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:30,200
you to death?

367
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:33,360
Because if she saved your life, you do owe her a beer.

368
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:35,240
I mean, that's true.

369
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:36,240
That is how it works.

370
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:40,560
Is it that you, did you give, did she give you a beer?

371
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:42,600
Because if that is the context.

372
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:44,600
May I borrow a beer, coworker?

373
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:45,600
Well, of course.

374
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:46,600
Do you have a beer in your desk?

375
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:48,600
Do you have any desk beer?

376
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:52,000
No, Eli, that was a, that was a hint.

377
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,000
I think it was.

378
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,000
It's definitely a hint.

379
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,000
Straight up.

380
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:58,960
I think, and even if it wasn't, fuck it, like go out and buy her a beer.

381
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:05,440
And if it's, if it wasn't like a, like a sexy, hey, let's find out type of thing, then you

382
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:07,000
guys will become closer friends.

383
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,800
That's a, that's a win-win.

384
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:10,040
That's a win-win in my book.

385
00:19:10,040 --> 00:19:13,280
Listen, Eli, it really sounds like this girl is purifier.

386
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:18,360
So it's important, just, you don't need hints.

387
00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:20,260
Everybody thinks there's, you don't need hints.

388
00:19:20,260 --> 00:19:22,640
Go out on a limb, ask the girl out.

389
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:26,620
If you're waiting for her to indicate to you that she's ready to be asked out, that's not

390
00:19:26,620 --> 00:19:27,620
how that works.

391
00:19:27,620 --> 00:19:30,120
Hi, it's time to ask me out now.

392
00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:31,120
Yeah.

393
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:32,480
Hint, ask me out.

394
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:33,540
Don't ask her out.

395
00:19:33,540 --> 00:19:35,020
Not in the traditional sense.

396
00:19:35,020 --> 00:19:36,920
Don't say, hey, would you like to go on a date?

397
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:40,120
Just say, hey, you know, how about, how about I buy you that beer?

398
00:19:40,120 --> 00:19:41,640
Ah, see, this is troubling.

399
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:43,340
This is where we get into problems.

400
00:19:43,340 --> 00:19:47,940
His next step is completely dependent on how long it's been since this happened.

401
00:19:47,940 --> 00:19:51,080
Because if you bring up something that happened three weeks ago, it's not going to be cute.

402
00:19:51,080 --> 00:19:55,860
Hey, do you remember, do you remember, uh, you had, you had that purple scrunchie in

403
00:19:55,860 --> 00:20:02,720
your hair and it's, it's, you smelled like lilacs and you, you asked for a beer and it's

404
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:07,760
time for me to get, I want to give you that beer, instantly become Crispin Glover.

405
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:15,960
Yeah, uh, you, if it's been a while, what you need to do is trick her, uh, do something

406
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:20,740
nice for her and then say, I guess we owe each other a beer now and then say, let's

407
00:20:20,740 --> 00:20:25,400
go have those beers, unless, and then you'll find out because she'll say, if it's not like

408
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:29,420
a hint, then she'll say, well, no, now we're even.

409
00:20:29,420 --> 00:20:31,000
So let's never talk again.

410
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,000
Yeah.

411
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,760
That seems like a pretty good decider.

412
00:20:34,760 --> 00:20:39,280
Have you considered, maybe she's not dropping a hint and maybe she's just like a raging

413
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:40,280
alcoholic.

414
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:41,280
She loves beer.

415
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:47,200
Like maybe she, and not just that, but like she does nice things for, for just everyone.

416
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:53,240
Um, and then like remarks, Hey, you, you do now owe me a beer.

417
00:20:53,240 --> 00:20:57,820
Like Hey, don't worry, I'll press the, the crossing signal for you, but you do owe me

418
00:20:57,820 --> 00:20:58,820
a Heineken.

419
00:20:58,820 --> 00:20:59,820
The sooner the better.

420
00:20:59,820 --> 00:21:05,280
Like right now, as soon as I got the shivers, if you could just like beer me, give me a

421
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:07,680
beer, beer me, bro.

422
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:09,160
Do you see her getting handed beers?

423
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:10,160
A lot of work.

424
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:13,220
Do people come to her with beers?

425
00:21:13,220 --> 00:21:16,840
She could just, I know my service was, was really great, but, um, don't worry about the

426
00:21:16,840 --> 00:21:17,840
tip.

427
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:21,180
If you could, there is a TGI Fridays next door.

428
00:21:21,180 --> 00:21:26,860
If you could pick me up a, just like a tall boy of a whatever brew they have on tap today

429
00:21:26,860 --> 00:21:31,500
and just, you know, slide it down this away, uh, we will be square.

430
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:34,920
We will be even up, but there is one thing you want to watch out for.

431
00:21:34,920 --> 00:21:39,720
If you are a guy who is bad at picking up hints, if you do the like, Hey coworker, let's

432
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:42,800
go grab a drink and she's like, all right, great.

433
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:47,320
You have established nothing because you didn't ask her out.

434
00:21:47,320 --> 00:21:49,940
You, there was no romance involved.

435
00:21:49,940 --> 00:21:53,440
You have no guarantee that this is quote a date.

436
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:56,160
I have to keep figuring out as the night goes.

437
00:21:56,160 --> 00:21:57,160
Yeah.

438
00:21:57,160 --> 00:22:01,640
You've got to pretend we're on your shoulder and we're telling you like, that was a hint.

439
00:22:01,640 --> 00:22:02,640
Yeah.

440
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:03,640
Go with it.

441
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:05,000
Remember when she took her boob out?

442
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,000
That was a hint.

443
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,000
Go with it.

444
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:10,160
I think I disagree with you wholeheartedly.

445
00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:14,480
I think it's got to start off like, Hey coworker, let's go hang out and the romance will blossom.

446
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:15,480
No, no, no.

447
00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:19,520
Travis is saying, he isn't saying that he needs to push it into date land.

448
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:26,880
What he's saying is that it's going to be tough navigating those waters if he's not

449
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:27,880
got his eyes open.

450
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:28,880
Yeah.

451
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:32,440
Is this like a person you've hung out with for three years and now you're hanging out

452
00:22:32,440 --> 00:22:36,020
outside of work or is this like beginning of a thing?

453
00:22:36,020 --> 00:22:37,200
Let's see where this goes.

454
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:40,880
So you need to just kind of like Justin said, navigate.

455
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:45,520
You're going to come up to all these, choose your own adventure spots and you need to make

456
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:47,320
all the right moves.

457
00:22:47,320 --> 00:22:54,360
Eli, you, I'd like to, to, to suggest to you that you change your outlook today, today,

458
00:22:54,360 --> 00:22:58,280
this Monday that you're listening to this, you need to change your outlook.

459
00:22:58,280 --> 00:23:02,400
You need to start telling yourself that everything is a hint.

460
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:03,400
Everything's an opportunity.

461
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:04,400
Not a closed door.

462
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:05,400
It's an open door.

463
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:09,360
And I say you start walking through those open doors and you, and if you're wrong about

464
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:13,280
it, you get your heart broken a few times and you get so tough that you won't even notice

465
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:14,280
anymore.

466
00:23:14,280 --> 00:23:18,880
But if you're right about it, you get that glorious opportunity that you would have missed

467
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:22,160
if you had been afraid that something wasn't a hint.

468
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:23,160
Everything's a hint, Eli.

469
00:23:23,160 --> 00:23:25,760
Start walking through those open doors.

470
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:29,760
Do people ever purchase products from the peanut enlargement emails?

471
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:31,560
Penis enlargement emails.

472
00:23:31,560 --> 00:23:32,560
What is a peanut?

473
00:23:32,560 --> 00:23:35,760
I'm allergic to peanuts.

474
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:39,760
It's what you have before you buy a penis enlargement product.

475
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:41,560
What are the chances of them working?

476
00:23:41,560 --> 00:23:42,560
Thanks.

477
00:23:42,560 --> 00:23:44,560
It's a glorious form spring.

478
00:23:44,560 --> 00:23:45,560
100%.

479
00:23:45,560 --> 00:23:47,280
100% effective every time.

480
00:23:47,280 --> 00:23:48,280
How could they not?

481
00:23:48,280 --> 00:23:49,760
They sell them on the internet.

482
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:50,920
Think about it.

483
00:23:50,920 --> 00:23:54,720
That's just math.

484
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:58,280
If you got a tiny wiener, no one will ever love you.

485
00:23:58,280 --> 00:24:02,480
If you take pills you bought off the internet, you've got a chance at love.

486
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:06,360
Just hang some weights from your dong so it's just stretched out.

487
00:24:06,360 --> 00:24:07,360
Yeah, sure.

488
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:10,840
Yeah, dong weights, but make sure you buy them off the internet.

489
00:24:10,840 --> 00:24:20,760
Everything you do regarding your peanut, it's so important that you only consult the internet.

490
00:24:20,760 --> 00:24:21,760
Doctors aren't going to help you out.

491
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:25,000
They're just going to look at your little prick and they're going to laugh at you.

492
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:27,440
They're going to laugh at you, smack it around with the back of their hand.

493
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:28,440
They're going to giggle.

494
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:30,520
They're going to flick it with their pinky finger.

495
00:24:30,520 --> 00:24:34,960
Flick it like one of those springy doorstops, just like that.

496
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:36,200
You got to go to the...

497
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:42,360
The internet's too big to care about your little balls and your precious little wiener.

498
00:24:42,360 --> 00:24:43,560
The internet's not going to care.

499
00:24:43,560 --> 00:24:47,320
You got to go and you got to take as many pills as they can throw at you.

500
00:24:47,320 --> 00:24:48,320
Yeah.

501
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:52,720
Just take all the pills that the internet has and you will not care anymore about your

502
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:53,720
wiener size.

503
00:24:53,720 --> 00:24:54,720
That's a stone fact.

504
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:57,400
Griffin, you got a Yahoo for me?

505
00:24:57,400 --> 00:24:58,820
I do.

506
00:24:58,820 --> 00:24:59,820
How about this one?

507
00:24:59,820 --> 00:25:02,120
It was sent in by Patrick Toy.

508
00:25:02,120 --> 00:25:05,480
It's by Yahoo Answers user Ghimrob.

509
00:25:05,480 --> 00:25:14,520
Yahoo asks, smelly wife, my wife comes home from work and she don't smell good.

510
00:25:14,520 --> 00:25:20,660
I want to do some cuddling and the good stuff while she gets here, but between work and

511
00:25:20,660 --> 00:25:23,920
cooking dinner, she just don't smell good.

512
00:25:23,920 --> 00:25:29,560
How do I get her to clean up her act so I can enjoy some husbandry rewards?

513
00:25:29,560 --> 00:25:36,360
Oh, fuck, you know what this question made me think of is when Justin used to work at

514
00:25:36,360 --> 00:25:42,120
the Olive Garden and he would come home every day smelling like just like six inches deep

515
00:25:42,120 --> 00:25:43,120
inside a butthole.

516
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:44,120
Like the worst.

517
00:25:44,120 --> 00:25:47,720
He used to call it the OG water that they would coat you in.

518
00:25:47,720 --> 00:25:50,800
You would be bathed in it at the end of the night.

519
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:56,800
So basically the guy's problem is his wife is busy working and cooking his meals and

520
00:25:56,800 --> 00:26:04,160
as a result, she she doesn't smell pleasant for the another a tertiary for the cuddling

521
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:07,680
and the good stuff for the cuddling and the good stuff.

522
00:26:07,680 --> 00:26:13,920
You know, I read that and I'm like, in my mind, the cuddling is the good stuff.

523
00:26:13,920 --> 00:26:15,720
God, that's so true.

524
00:26:15,720 --> 00:26:20,980
All that all that all those fringe benefits, they're just they're just they're tacked

525
00:26:20,980 --> 00:26:21,980
on there.

526
00:26:21,980 --> 00:26:26,720
It's all about a good, hard cuddle.

527
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:31,280
You know, this is something where the direct approach is really it's going to be a feast

528
00:26:31,280 --> 00:26:32,280
or famine.

529
00:26:32,280 --> 00:26:39,340
I mean, yeah, either you're going to solve this problem lickety split or you're going

530
00:26:39,340 --> 00:26:44,760
to tell your wife that she smells too bad to cuddle and you won't have that problem

531
00:26:44,760 --> 00:26:46,720
that exact problem anymore.

532
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:51,240
No, just just look at her and say, you know, honey, I've been sitting here on the couch

533
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:54,840
all day watching Maury and waiting for you to get home to cuddle.

534
00:26:54,840 --> 00:26:55,840
You smell like buttholes.

535
00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:59,320
You smell like eight buttholes in a butthole bag.

536
00:26:59,320 --> 00:27:00,320
Get it together.

537
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:03,000
I'm going to sit on the couch for another 12 hours.

538
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:05,360
We'll see you work it out.

539
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:06,880
I just I just flipped.

540
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:08,480
I just flipped on this guy.

541
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:09,720
Fuck this guy.

542
00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:10,720
You fuck this way.

543
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:11,720
You weren't in camp.

544
00:27:11,720 --> 00:27:12,720
Fuck this guy.

545
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:19,040
No, I mean, at first I was like, that's rough because he doesn't all he loves this woman

546
00:27:19,040 --> 00:27:20,040
so much.

547
00:27:20,040 --> 00:27:21,040
Right.

548
00:27:21,040 --> 00:27:22,040
Loves her so much.

549
00:27:22,040 --> 00:27:27,960
And the only thing that's keeping their love stagnant is that she smells she smells like

550
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:28,960
dookie water.

551
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:32,880
But now it's like, get your shit together.

552
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:37,040
I'm sure maybe you don't smell good from sitting on the couch all day.

553
00:27:37,040 --> 00:27:38,480
Your bed sores.

554
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:39,480
And your bed sores.

555
00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:45,960
Maybe you have bed sores and those smell like festering dookie water.

556
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:47,120
I'm so mad at him.

557
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:48,120
You are mad at him.

558
00:27:48,120 --> 00:27:50,400
I can tell that this has gotten really real for you.

559
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:51,800
This has gotten very serious.

560
00:27:51,800 --> 00:27:53,960
I am angry at this gentleman.

561
00:27:53,960 --> 00:27:56,880
Well, who does he think he is?

562
00:27:56,880 --> 00:27:57,880
Right.

563
00:27:57,880 --> 00:28:02,240
But on the other hand, maybe she smells real bad.

564
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:05,320
I just read a really great answer.

565
00:28:05,320 --> 00:28:06,320
Tell me.

566
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:07,320
Yahoo!

567
00:28:07,320 --> 00:28:09,000
answers user Drea responded.

568
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:10,280
Just a suggestion.

569
00:28:10,280 --> 00:28:15,300
Draw a bubble bath for her so that when she walks in the door, it will be ready for her.

570
00:28:15,300 --> 00:28:19,000
Make it romantic if you can add to the mood.

571
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:20,000
That's fresh.

572
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:21,000
That's a fresh.

573
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:22,320
That's outside the box thinking.

574
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:28,080
But see, that's that's just a thinly veiled statement that you smell bad.

575
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:29,880
That can only work so many times like this.

576
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:34,680
Like, Seenar, I love you, but I can't take a bath every day as soon as I get home from

577
00:28:34,680 --> 00:28:35,680
the office.

578
00:28:35,680 --> 00:28:36,680
Hey, baby girl.

579
00:28:36,680 --> 00:28:38,680
Hey, baby girl at 630.

580
00:28:38,680 --> 00:28:39,680
And you know what that means.

581
00:28:39,680 --> 00:28:40,680
Rub a dub dub.

582
00:28:40,680 --> 00:28:41,680
Time for your scrub.

583
00:28:41,680 --> 00:28:47,720
I'll be in the, I'll be downstairs watching baseball.

584
00:28:47,720 --> 00:28:50,440
You come get me when you're done for the cuddlin' and the good stuff.

585
00:28:50,440 --> 00:28:51,440
Yeah.

586
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:55,760
Don't spend too long in there because this hungry man isn't going to microwave itself.

587
00:28:55,760 --> 00:28:56,760
Hey, honey.

588
00:28:56,760 --> 00:28:59,880
I made dinner reservations for us at 630.

589
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:01,880
Uh, I don't think you did.

590
00:29:01,880 --> 00:29:07,800
I think I think maybe you need to get those changed to 730 because we ain't going out

591
00:29:07,800 --> 00:29:12,240
in public until you get down with a scrub-a-roo.

592
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:13,240
I love you so much.

593
00:29:13,240 --> 00:29:14,240
I love you, baby.

594
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:15,240
I love you so much.

595
00:29:15,240 --> 00:29:16,240
Why do you smell so bad?

596
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:17,240
Where do you work?

597
00:29:17,240 --> 00:29:19,440
You need to quit working at the waste treatment plant.

598
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:20,440
Ugh.

599
00:29:20,440 --> 00:29:21,440
Ugh.

600
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:22,440
Ugh.

601
00:29:22,440 --> 00:29:23,440
Leave her.

602
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:24,440
Ugh.

603
00:29:24,440 --> 00:29:26,800
You're saying leave her and leave him.

604
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:28,480
Everyone leave each other in this situation.

605
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:30,480
I'm so mad.

606
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:34,920
This girl in my class has some sort of love-hate relationship with me.

607
00:29:34,920 --> 00:29:39,780
Sometimes she'll act incredibly flirtatious and sometimes she'll straight up insult me.

608
00:29:39,780 --> 00:29:45,540
Even weirder, she flips out, she flips between these behaviors multiple times each day.

609
00:29:45,540 --> 00:29:47,760
How exactly am I supposed to react to this?

610
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:52,760
Yes, I'm a dude and in high school, vexed in New Mexico.

611
00:29:52,760 --> 00:29:54,760
Oh, man.

612
00:29:54,760 --> 00:29:55,760
Welcome.

613
00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:57,760
Bienvenidos, muchacho.

614
00:29:57,760 --> 00:30:01,760
You're becoming a man.

615
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:02,760
Wow.

616
00:30:02,760 --> 00:30:08,400
I bet it does seem like that, doesn't it?

617
00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:21,200
So oh, gosh, you have discovered that occasionally, every once in a while, some girls be crazy.

618
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:22,200
Women be shopping.

619
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:23,200
Yeah.

620
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:26,240
Well, I'm not shopping so much as just crazy.

621
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:27,240
Yeah.

622
00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:33,640
And there's a good chance that she is straight up crazy, like real crazy, like kill a bunny

623
00:30:33,640 --> 00:30:35,400
on your doorstep crazy.

624
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:36,400
Right.

625
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:37,400
Right.

626
00:30:37,400 --> 00:30:39,880
You don't need to marry her.

627
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:43,520
Maybe she's bad at flirting and she forgets how to do it sometimes.

628
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:44,520
That's how it hit me.

629
00:30:44,520 --> 00:30:50,120
It hit me like a harmless like, oh, I'm bad at flirting so I'm playfully mocking you.

630
00:30:50,120 --> 00:30:52,240
I think in high school, totally down.

631
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:59,400
I think once you get to college, then it is usually a sign of crazy talent.

632
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:01,520
Yeah, I get what you're saying.

633
00:31:01,520 --> 00:31:02,520
And you know what?

634
00:31:02,520 --> 00:31:03,800
You're really sensitive in high school.

635
00:31:03,800 --> 00:31:11,600
So a lot of you got to hear, OK, here's what you do when she insults you.

636
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:13,180
You got to take it as flirting, too.

637
00:31:13,180 --> 00:31:14,180
You got to get that tough.

638
00:31:14,180 --> 00:31:18,800
You have to be that confident to be able to to be able to handle this Philly.

639
00:31:18,800 --> 00:31:23,580
It seems to me like all that's well and good, but this is a non-issue.

640
00:31:23,580 --> 00:31:26,120
You just stop talking to that person.

641
00:31:26,120 --> 00:31:30,720
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

642
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:31,720
He learns nothing.

643
00:31:31,720 --> 00:31:36,760
But you're saying like work through getting insulted at the chance of maybe making out

644
00:31:36,760 --> 00:31:37,760
with this chick.

645
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:39,520
Like, oh, don't do any of that.

646
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:43,560
Have no goal other than to let her insults roll off your back.

647
00:31:43,560 --> 00:31:49,380
And if you are into this, this lady, then she will find that irresistible.

648
00:31:49,380 --> 00:31:53,120
You just have to be confident and roll with it.

649
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:56,220
Like if she insults you, you say, yep, nailed it.

650
00:31:56,220 --> 00:31:57,220
What's up?

651
00:31:57,220 --> 00:31:58,220
Dead on.

652
00:31:58,220 --> 00:31:59,220
What else you got?

653
00:31:59,220 --> 00:32:00,220
You know?

654
00:32:00,220 --> 00:32:05,680
You're not feeling it still well, as long as you're doing it as like a thought exercise.

655
00:32:05,680 --> 00:32:09,720
Like, how many insults can I take before I go home and cry?

656
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:11,620
Yeah, then go for it.

657
00:32:11,620 --> 00:32:15,320
This isn't going to turn into a relationship if you're just trying to teach her a lesson.

658
00:32:15,320 --> 00:32:20,200
He's the stronger person, but you got to keep in mind.

659
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:21,340
She's not just insulting him.

660
00:32:21,340 --> 00:32:23,440
She's also flirting with him like that.

661
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:28,480
That in and of itself, like I can remember plenty of young relationships I had that started

662
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:32,760
out with like girls flirting with me and also like playfully insulting me.

663
00:32:32,760 --> 00:32:35,080
Dude, Vex, you're in there, dude.

664
00:32:35,080 --> 00:32:36,080
You're in there.

665
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:37,080
I think you're totally, totally cool.

666
00:32:37,080 --> 00:32:38,080
Yeah.

667
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:39,080
You need to out crazy her.

668
00:32:39,080 --> 00:32:41,560
And when she flirts with you, get really offended.

669
00:32:41,560 --> 00:32:43,920
And when she insults you, get really turned on.

670
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:45,480
You smell like you work at Olive Garden.

671
00:32:45,480 --> 00:32:48,180
Get out of my face, hooker.

672
00:32:48,180 --> 00:32:49,180
Say that.

673
00:32:49,180 --> 00:32:50,180
See how that works out.

674
00:32:50,180 --> 00:32:51,180
Don't say it.

675
00:32:51,180 --> 00:32:52,180
Don't say any of that.

676
00:32:52,180 --> 00:32:54,600
Don't say any of that, but say something like that.

677
00:32:54,600 --> 00:32:55,760
Whatever you say in high school.

678
00:32:55,760 --> 00:32:57,520
You're not fire or something.

679
00:32:57,520 --> 00:32:58,520
Yeah.

680
00:32:58,520 --> 00:32:59,800
You are so not raw.

681
00:32:59,800 --> 00:33:01,040
You're not raw.

682
00:33:01,040 --> 00:33:02,040
You're cooked.

683
00:33:02,040 --> 00:33:04,000
You're cooked in fire.

684
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:05,000
You're braised.

685
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:06,000
I'm going to set you on fire.

686
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,480
Shit is so cooked.

687
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:10,680
So I guess we've helped you pretty good.

688
00:33:10,680 --> 00:33:16,880
How do I deal with idiots who park in front of my building and take up several parking

689
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:17,880
spaces?

690
00:33:17,880 --> 00:33:20,000
This is a recurring problem in the residence hall where I live.

691
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:24,880
I have considered leaving menacing notes or even bashing their windows out in frustration.

692
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:25,880
Whoa.

693
00:33:25,880 --> 00:33:26,880
Whoa.

694
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:29,200
I'm going to park far away and I don't know where else to turn.

695
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:30,200
Please help.

696
00:33:30,200 --> 00:33:32,320
Zune user, Gmail.

697
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:37,160
This is another one of those terrible self-centered people problems that always happens.

698
00:33:37,160 --> 00:33:40,720
Those people that like park in the middle of two parking spaces because they don't want

699
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:44,560
their like 1986 Buick LeSabre to get scratched up.

700
00:33:44,560 --> 00:33:45,560
Yep.

701
00:33:45,560 --> 00:33:46,560
Oh God.

702
00:33:46,560 --> 00:33:47,560
I hate those people so much.

703
00:33:47,560 --> 00:33:50,720
Can I give an embarrassing confession to you guys?

704
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:55,840
What I do is I walk past their car and I key it.

705
00:33:55,840 --> 00:33:56,840
I have done it.

706
00:33:56,840 --> 00:33:57,840
You don't really do that.

707
00:33:57,840 --> 00:34:03,920
Griffin, five or six times someone has taken a parking spot and they take up two spots

708
00:34:03,920 --> 00:34:08,760
and I key their car because oops, the opposite happened.

709
00:34:08,760 --> 00:34:09,760
Oops.

710
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:11,960
That punishment does not fit that crime at all.

711
00:34:11,960 --> 00:34:12,960
It totally fits that crime.

712
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:13,960
I disagree.

713
00:34:13,960 --> 00:34:14,960
You learned your lesson.

714
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:15,960
You've learned your lesson.

715
00:34:15,960 --> 00:34:18,760
That is not, you are not going to do that again.

716
00:34:18,760 --> 00:34:24,120
Maybe it's just like a 16 year old kid who like hasn't learned how to park yet and that's

717
00:34:24,120 --> 00:34:28,960
his new Jetta and you just, you just, you just, you know, ruined his Christmas.

718
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:29,960
Learn to park.

719
00:34:29,960 --> 00:34:32,120
Bounce it out, scratch into the car.

720
00:34:32,120 --> 00:34:33,120
I love you.

721
00:34:33,120 --> 00:34:35,640
No, don't do that.

722
00:34:35,640 --> 00:34:36,640
I key it.

723
00:34:36,640 --> 00:34:40,320
I don't do something like big and pronounced, but if you're the sort who would get obsessed

724
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:44,220
about your car, you're going to notice that and you're going to not do that anymore.

725
00:34:44,220 --> 00:34:45,220
It's a lesson.

726
00:34:45,220 --> 00:34:48,760
I've taught you a lesson about growth.

727
00:34:48,760 --> 00:34:54,040
And maybe just, you know, if you want to go a little less, you know, invasive, just leave

728
00:34:54,040 --> 00:34:58,680
a ball print on his window, pop your balls out, push them against there.

729
00:34:58,680 --> 00:34:59,680
Keep on moving.

730
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:02,120
See, that's good because it's, it's, it's temporary.

731
00:35:02,120 --> 00:35:04,520
You don't have to pay to get it buffed out.

732
00:35:04,520 --> 00:35:11,120
Um, but also you touch your balls on a surface, which I guess a little post-it note next to

733
00:35:11,120 --> 00:35:14,200
it with an arrow that says, those are my balls, though.

734
00:35:14,200 --> 00:35:16,240
My balls touch these.

735
00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:21,360
Don't leave some fucking passive aggressive note though, like, Hey, good parking job that

736
00:35:21,360 --> 00:35:23,000
you did there, dude.

737
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:24,920
Like that's the D that's even douchier.

738
00:35:24,920 --> 00:35:27,160
I think then maybe you give them a warning.

739
00:35:27,160 --> 00:35:31,360
Maybe you give them a warning note, say, Hey, if you do this again, I'm going to key your

740
00:35:31,360 --> 00:35:32,360
car.

741
00:35:32,360 --> 00:35:36,400
And then if it happens again, Griffin, can you agree that you'd be well within your rights

742
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:39,340
at that point?

743
00:35:39,340 --> 00:35:41,560
I would say two warnings just to be safe.

744
00:35:41,560 --> 00:35:46,280
The first one, like, Hey, um, just to let you know, do you have one more, uh, one more

745
00:35:46,280 --> 00:35:47,280
warning shot?

746
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:49,720
Uh, but you are getting awfully close to key town.

747
00:35:49,720 --> 00:35:53,680
Uh, and then the second one's like, Hey dude, no kidding.

748
00:35:53,680 --> 00:35:59,440
Um, you have one, this is your last, this is your last chance before a retribution.

749
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:06,280
And then I think you can leave a small, a small key scratch on like the two warnings.

750
00:36:06,280 --> 00:36:09,000
You can set the hood of his car on fire.

751
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:13,840
Well, by small key scratch, uh, he means if you could scratch a review for my brother,

752
00:36:13,840 --> 00:36:18,560
my brother and me and just a, our web address into there, that would be great.

753
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:19,560
Yeah.

754
00:36:19,560 --> 00:36:20,880
Just scratch our names and addresses in there.

755
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:21,880
It's all great.

756
00:36:21,880 --> 00:36:24,020
It's all good stuff, right?

757
00:36:24,020 --> 00:36:30,160
And make sure you scratch in the method in which each of us would least like to be murdered.

758
00:36:30,160 --> 00:36:31,240
Mine is stabbing.

759
00:36:31,240 --> 00:36:34,880
I don't, I think Travis is drowning and Justin's fire.

760
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:35,880
No.

761
00:36:35,880 --> 00:36:36,880
Yeah, you know he is.

762
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:37,880
What's up?

763
00:36:37,880 --> 00:36:45,320
That is so, so cash, so raw, Justin's fucking young money.

764
00:36:45,320 --> 00:36:46,320
Don't do anything.

765
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:50,720
Cause this fucking, this hamster wheel we all live on, this hamster wheel called life

766
00:36:50,720 --> 00:36:55,600
keeps on spinning and like, if people are douches, they're going to get, they're going

767
00:36:55,600 --> 00:36:56,600
to get there.

768
00:36:56,600 --> 00:36:57,600
They are.

769
00:36:57,600 --> 00:36:58,600
They are.

770
00:36:58,600 --> 00:36:59,960
And you are to be the instrument of that getting.

771
00:36:59,960 --> 00:37:00,960
Exactly.

772
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:05,820
You are not the arbiter of God's justice that you lay down with your fiery key.

773
00:37:05,820 --> 00:37:07,520
How do you know till you do it?

774
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:11,920
Unless, unless there are good people willing to stand up for what they believe in, then

775
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:15,160
all God's got is a handful of wishes and hopes.

776
00:37:15,160 --> 00:37:19,680
The people in this world that do that shit and park and take up like three parking spaces

777
00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:21,400
with their stupid hummers.

778
00:37:21,400 --> 00:37:24,480
It's because no one ever does anything.

779
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:29,160
They'll leave like a little post that says, oh, please don't take up these parking spaces

780
00:37:29,160 --> 00:37:30,160
anymore.

781
00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:33,760
You got to get out there and just pee in their window.

782
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:35,840
Set the, set the hood on fire.

783
00:37:35,840 --> 00:37:36,840
I like that.

784
00:37:36,840 --> 00:37:37,840
Set the hood on fire.

785
00:37:37,840 --> 00:37:40,800
Stand on top of it and say, this is a symbol.

786
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:41,800
This is a symbol.

787
00:37:41,800 --> 00:37:46,320
Put a symbol on the car in lighter fluid and light it on fire so it burns like a hand given

788
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:47,320
the finger.

789
00:37:47,320 --> 00:37:48,320
Yeah.

790
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:53,080
I feel like we need to rerun the disclaimer that Bob Ball does at the beginning of the

791
00:37:53,080 --> 00:37:57,280
show, like right here, like right in the middle of the show so that people know not to actually

792
00:37:57,280 --> 00:37:58,280
do any of these things.

793
00:37:58,280 --> 00:38:00,800
How about putting lunch meat all over their car?

794
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:01,800
Oops.

795
00:38:01,800 --> 00:38:03,600
No, cause that like eats the pain off.

796
00:38:03,600 --> 00:38:05,160
But like turkey, turkey won't do that.

797
00:38:05,160 --> 00:38:06,680
Just cover their car in turkey.

798
00:38:06,680 --> 00:38:07,680
Got a bologna.

799
00:38:07,680 --> 00:38:11,240
And leave a message that's like, I just gave you a turkey car.

800
00:38:11,240 --> 00:38:14,120
You're going turkey car.

801
00:38:14,120 --> 00:38:15,120
Gobble gobble, bitch.

802
00:38:15,120 --> 00:38:18,400
Gobble gobble, bitch.

803
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:19,400
Learn to park.

804
00:38:19,400 --> 00:38:21,240
This shit's hickory smoke, dummy.

805
00:38:21,240 --> 00:38:23,640
I just hickory smoked your shit.

806
00:38:23,640 --> 00:38:24,640
Not fire.

807
00:38:24,640 --> 00:38:25,640
How about a Yahoo?

808
00:38:25,640 --> 00:38:26,640
Yeah.

809
00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:27,640
Break me off of a slice.

810
00:38:27,640 --> 00:38:28,640
This one was sent in by Louie Dog again.

811
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:29,640
Thanks Louie.

812
00:38:29,640 --> 00:38:34,480
That's by Yahoo Answers user, Dansby, who asks, I think we've actually had a question

813
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:36,320
by Dansby before.

814
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:38,240
That name felt familiar in my mouth.

815
00:38:38,240 --> 00:38:44,280
Anyway, Dansby asks, is it okay to use worn out underwear as packing materials for holiday

816
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:45,280
gifts?

817
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:51,320
Well, the holidays are coming up and I have a big bin full of worn out underwear that

818
00:38:51,320 --> 00:38:53,640
our family has been accumulating for a while.

819
00:38:53,640 --> 00:38:56,880
I know I need some cushioning material for shipping out holiday gifts.

820
00:38:56,880 --> 00:38:59,680
Is it acceptable to use the underwear for this purpose?

821
00:38:59,680 --> 00:39:03,660
Of course the present will be inside a wrap box inside the shipping box, so it's not like

822
00:39:03,660 --> 00:39:05,640
it will be inside the gift.

823
00:39:05,640 --> 00:39:10,600
BQ, what's your favorite winter holiday song?

824
00:39:10,600 --> 00:39:12,960
What kind of fucking family are you in?

825
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:18,220
I think my favorite winter holiday song is You Ruined Our Christmas With Your Stinky

826
00:39:18,220 --> 00:39:21,480
Awful Old Underwear That You Wrapped Around The iPod.

827
00:39:21,480 --> 00:39:25,080
Why does your family have a bin of worn out underwear?

828
00:39:25,080 --> 00:39:27,420
Well, additional details.

829
00:39:27,420 --> 00:39:30,540
Our family tries very, very hard to be eco-friendly.

830
00:39:30,540 --> 00:39:34,080
We don't have anything else to use and the thought of buying extra paper or bubble wrap

831
00:39:34,080 --> 00:39:36,360
to waste makes me cry for the earth.

832
00:39:36,360 --> 00:39:38,160
You know what makes me cry for the earth?

833
00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:42,080
You know what makes me cry for the earth?

834
00:39:42,080 --> 00:39:43,680
Your stinky awful underwear.

835
00:39:43,680 --> 00:39:48,520
The crap that you're shipping through, you're shipping it through the US Postal Service.

836
00:39:48,520 --> 00:39:51,680
I send my rent check to my landlord through that.

837
00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:55,340
I could open up, you might live in my neighborhood, I might open up your mailbox and get like

838
00:39:55,340 --> 00:40:02,260
a fucking pungent, like a foamy spume of your fucking stinky old underwear that hits me

839
00:40:02,260 --> 00:40:07,400
in the nose and stays with me for the rest of my life.

840
00:40:07,400 --> 00:40:08,400
Oh fuck.

841
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:11,200
It makes me mad that it sounds like you've already made this decision because you've

842
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:13,600
been collecting this underwear for a while now.

843
00:40:13,600 --> 00:40:14,600
Yeah!

844
00:40:14,600 --> 00:40:15,600
What have you been doing?

845
00:40:15,600 --> 00:40:16,600
Where are you keeping it?

846
00:40:16,600 --> 00:40:21,200
Hey, uh, hey dude, if you have to send it in dirty underwear, it ain't a gift.

847
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:24,920
It ain't a gift, it's an oppa gift.

848
00:40:24,920 --> 00:40:25,920
God damn it.

849
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:29,520
I don't, like these green questions are straight bombing me out.

850
00:40:29,520 --> 00:40:30,760
They're really harshing my mellow.

851
00:40:30,760 --> 00:40:33,960
I wouldn't give a fuck if the earth had like six years left in it.

852
00:40:33,960 --> 00:40:37,840
If the earth had four years left in it and people didn't send underwear through the US

853
00:40:37,840 --> 00:40:41,840
Postal Service, like, that's a trade off I'm willing to make.

854
00:40:41,840 --> 00:40:49,880
It can go 2012 up in 2016 as long as, as long as people stop pooping in bags and sending

855
00:40:49,880 --> 00:40:51,720
their dirty ass underwear to their aunt.

856
00:40:51,720 --> 00:40:56,880
All I can think is there has to come a moment where like you go to pull out a pair of underwear

857
00:40:56,880 --> 00:41:01,040
and you're like, oh this is covered in stains and the elastic is shot and your mom's like

858
00:41:01,040 --> 00:41:02,800
put it in the bin.

859
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:04,120
Like put it right in the bin.

860
00:41:04,120 --> 00:41:05,120
Get it in the bin.

861
00:41:05,120 --> 00:41:06,120
No!

862
00:41:06,120 --> 00:41:07,120
Fucking throw that shit out!

863
00:41:07,120 --> 00:41:08,120
Throw it away!

864
00:41:08,120 --> 00:41:13,240
You're not going to reuse those textiles, don't, don't fucking kid yourself.

865
00:41:13,240 --> 00:41:15,040
Hey check out my new winter coat.

866
00:41:15,040 --> 00:41:17,920
Lots of boxers went into this one.

867
00:41:17,920 --> 00:41:21,920
Uh, did you uh, did you get that package?

868
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:23,760
Did you, did you open that package from Daniel?

869
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:24,960
Yeah, I did.

870
00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:25,960
What was inside of it?

871
00:41:25,960 --> 00:41:29,920
Uh, a bunch of dirty underwear and a picture of a car.

872
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:30,920
So I don't know.

873
00:41:30,920 --> 00:41:31,920
How's your Christmas?

874
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:33,680
It's the best Christmas ever.

875
00:41:33,680 --> 00:41:34,680
Thanks for asking.

876
00:41:34,680 --> 00:41:41,080
Yeah, my husband got me a picture of a car and my crazy cousin sent me a, a, a package

877
00:41:41,080 --> 00:41:44,840
of new underwear wrapped in dirty underwear.

878
00:41:44,840 --> 00:41:47,400
So uh, it's been a pretty good holiday so far.

879
00:41:47,400 --> 00:41:49,280
Thanks for being born, Jay-Z.

880
00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:50,520
God I hate everyone.

881
00:41:50,520 --> 00:41:53,080
I hate everyone so much.

882
00:41:53,080 --> 00:41:54,080
Especially green people.

883
00:41:54,080 --> 00:41:55,080
Just let it burn.

884
00:41:55,080 --> 00:41:56,080
I know.

885
00:41:56,080 --> 00:41:57,080
Let it burn.

886
00:41:57,080 --> 00:42:04,760
Let's ride this bitch into the ground and then, and then everything will be a wasteland

887
00:42:04,760 --> 00:42:09,480
and the population of the planet will be just decimated, but we'll be a small community

888
00:42:09,480 --> 00:42:11,400
and we can start over, right?

889
00:42:11,400 --> 00:42:12,880
And there won't be any internet.

890
00:42:12,880 --> 00:42:16,880
There won't be any internet and people can't do things like go on the internet and ask

891
00:42:16,880 --> 00:42:22,960
if they can send their dirty, stupid underwear to their, to their familial relations.

892
00:42:22,960 --> 00:42:28,120
It's like that question of, you know, you're, you're extending life, but are you improving

893
00:42:28,120 --> 00:42:29,120
life?

894
00:42:29,120 --> 00:42:30,120
You know what I mean?

895
00:42:30,120 --> 00:42:37,080
If I could live to 200 but I'm buried in a pile of used underpants, I'd kill myself.

896
00:42:37,080 --> 00:42:38,080
Yeah.

897
00:42:38,080 --> 00:42:39,080
It's not worth it.

898
00:42:39,080 --> 00:42:40,080
It's, it's about trade-offs.

899
00:42:40,080 --> 00:42:44,480
The earth's not worth preserving if it's full of a bunch of dirty underwear savers.

900
00:42:44,480 --> 00:42:49,200
I guarantee you flash forward like 200 years to like my great, great, great, great, great

901
00:42:49,200 --> 00:42:52,040
grandkids and you're like, Hey, how do you like the earth?

902
00:42:52,040 --> 00:42:56,920
And they're like, I just wish everyone would throw away their old underwear.

903
00:42:56,920 --> 00:42:59,800
We are knee deep in old underwear up in this bitch.

904
00:42:59,800 --> 00:43:00,800
Please listen.

905
00:43:00,800 --> 00:43:06,400
I, I'm not endorsing a completely hedonistic lifestyle, right?

906
00:43:06,400 --> 00:43:09,480
Like I, I recycle.

907
00:43:09,480 --> 00:43:15,660
I just don't think it's too much to ask that we just like, we throw our underwear away

908
00:43:15,660 --> 00:43:20,880
and when you ship things to people, if you don't want to use paper or bubble wrap, you

909
00:43:20,880 --> 00:43:22,560
just got to risk it.

910
00:43:22,560 --> 00:43:26,040
You got to risk the fact that your, your presence is going to break.

911
00:43:26,040 --> 00:43:27,120
Leaves are everywhere.

912
00:43:27,120 --> 00:43:28,120
There are leaves.

913
00:43:28,120 --> 00:43:29,120
You love the earth.

914
00:43:29,120 --> 00:43:30,120
Use some leaves.

915
00:43:30,120 --> 00:43:31,120
Yeah.

916
00:43:31,120 --> 00:43:33,640
There are so many other options here.

917
00:43:33,640 --> 00:43:35,920
Why is that the option you go to?

918
00:43:35,920 --> 00:43:42,720
I would rather rip up my carpet and put it in the box or use like an old my own hair.

919
00:43:42,720 --> 00:43:44,640
Use an old coat.

920
00:43:44,640 --> 00:43:49,880
Don't use, don't use the only article of clothing that touches your balls and everything.

921
00:43:49,880 --> 00:43:56,520
I, I want to hear Griffin's last question.

922
00:43:56,520 --> 00:43:59,680
But first of a few housekeeping notes.

923
00:43:59,680 --> 00:44:05,080
My brother, my brother and me has a website, it's mbmbam.com.

924
00:44:05,080 --> 00:44:07,080
If you go there, you can chat with other fans.

925
00:44:07,080 --> 00:44:09,320
We've got hundreds of users there talking up.

926
00:44:09,320 --> 00:44:10,400
We have ranks now.

927
00:44:10,400 --> 00:44:14,120
So the more you post, the higher your, your rank is.

928
00:44:14,120 --> 00:44:19,760
You can get to, I think honorary brother is the highest rank, which everyone should really

929
00:44:19,760 --> 00:44:22,320
be, you know, be shooting for.

930
00:44:22,320 --> 00:44:23,320
Strive for that.

931
00:44:23,320 --> 00:44:26,760
But you'll also be Jeffrey for a good long while if you get high enough.

932
00:44:26,760 --> 00:44:30,040
So that's worth it.

933
00:44:30,040 --> 00:44:33,920
We really appreciate everybody tweeting about the show.

934
00:44:33,920 --> 00:44:38,560
The download numbers continue to grow just because you're telling your friends and talking

935
00:44:38,560 --> 00:44:39,560
about it.

936
00:44:39,560 --> 00:44:41,120
Please, please, please keep that up.

937
00:44:41,120 --> 00:44:45,480
If you haven't, give us a review on iTunes.

938
00:44:45,480 --> 00:44:47,400
That helps get the word out.

939
00:44:47,400 --> 00:44:52,120
And tweet about the show, you know, if you, if you think of it, if you got room in there,

940
00:44:52,120 --> 00:44:56,000
you want to throw a link to the site, just so people know how to get their adventure

941
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:57,360
started.

942
00:44:57,360 --> 00:44:59,560
That would, that would be great.

943
00:44:59,560 --> 00:45:05,000
And every week we receive, you know, wonderfully funny and insightful questions, but we always

944
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:06,000
want more.

945
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:07,440
We always want to hear from you.

946
00:45:07,440 --> 00:45:11,400
You know, you can send in a question, you can send in a comment, you can tell us about

947
00:45:11,400 --> 00:45:17,280
how our advice touched you in some way, though it should not, it should never touch you.

948
00:45:17,280 --> 00:45:19,760
But if we can tickle, we can tickle your funny bone.

949
00:45:19,760 --> 00:45:21,840
We just shouldn't tickle your practical bone, right?

950
00:45:21,840 --> 00:45:22,840
Your practicality.

951
00:45:22,840 --> 00:45:27,320
Let us know so that we can be held liable for it.

952
00:45:27,320 --> 00:45:32,560
And you know, just, you can email us, MBMBAM at gmail.com.

953
00:45:32,560 --> 00:45:37,560
You can tweet at us, hashtag MBMBAM.

954
00:45:37,560 --> 00:45:39,200
The website has all this on there.

955
00:45:39,200 --> 00:45:43,400
You can, you know, there's a place to send a question straight through the website and

956
00:45:43,400 --> 00:45:48,200
hit up FormSpring and you know, maybe eventually we'll go on there and clear out some of the

957
00:45:48,200 --> 00:45:54,040
FormSpring questions, the thousands and thousands we have saved up.

958
00:45:54,040 --> 00:45:58,540
I feel like we should, I don't want to bring the energy down, but I feel like we should

959
00:45:58,540 --> 00:46:06,000
address the, the, the podcast awards because we, I'm not going to call bullshit all the,

960
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:09,880
all the nominees, they, you know, they're great, great shows.

961
00:46:09,880 --> 00:46:12,880
They're very deserving.

962
00:46:12,880 --> 00:46:13,880
But boycott.

963
00:46:13,880 --> 00:46:14,880
Yep.

964
00:46:14,880 --> 00:46:15,880
Whoa.

965
00:46:15,880 --> 00:46:17,360
I'm boycotting that shit.

966
00:46:17,360 --> 00:46:20,840
I got my invitation down in Santa Cruz.

967
00:46:20,840 --> 00:46:21,840
Not going.

968
00:46:21,840 --> 00:46:22,840
Fuck that noise.

969
00:46:22,840 --> 00:46:23,840
Fuck that noise.

970
00:46:23,840 --> 00:46:24,840
I even bought a tux and everything.

971
00:46:24,840 --> 00:46:29,000
You will not have my attendance, sirs.

972
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:30,000
I'm down with that.

973
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:31,000
Yeah, me too.

974
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:32,000
We're not going.

975
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:33,760
Thank you everybody who voted for us though.

976
00:46:33,760 --> 00:46:34,760
Yeah.

977
00:46:34,760 --> 00:46:39,240
I just wish you had tried, you know, maybe a little, maybe a little bit harder.

978
00:46:39,240 --> 00:46:43,760
I decided to start my own podcast awards and what's it called?

979
00:46:43,760 --> 00:46:45,720
Spoiler alert.

980
00:46:45,720 --> 00:46:46,720
We won.

981
00:46:46,720 --> 00:46:47,720
Yay.

982
00:46:47,720 --> 00:46:48,720
The Bambi's.

983
00:46:48,720 --> 00:46:49,720
The Bambi's.

984
00:46:49,720 --> 00:46:50,720
The Bambi's.

985
00:46:50,720 --> 00:46:56,080
You can vote for them at Bambi's awards for mybrothermybrothermade.com.

986
00:46:56,080 --> 00:46:59,000
No, it's.gov.

987
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:00,000
Is it.gov now?

988
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:01,540
Yeah, it's government sponsored.

989
00:47:01,540 --> 00:47:08,480
We got a national endowment for the arts thing that we're giving out like grants, but, and

990
00:47:08,480 --> 00:47:10,200
we're giving them to each other for Christmas.

991
00:47:10,200 --> 00:47:11,600
Merry Christmas, everybody.

992
00:47:11,600 --> 00:47:12,600
One more.

993
00:47:12,600 --> 00:47:17,200
I got you a national endowment to the arts grant and I wrapped it in underwear.

994
00:47:17,200 --> 00:47:19,600
It's a picture of a national endowment to the arts grant.

995
00:47:19,600 --> 00:47:20,600
Yeah, it's coming.

996
00:47:20,600 --> 00:47:21,600
It's coming soon.

997
00:47:21,600 --> 00:47:27,360
Travis, I don't know if this is something we need to address on the show, but I am curious

998
00:47:27,360 --> 00:47:32,280
why in the show notes you prepared, there is a picture of a dog in a bee costume.

999
00:47:32,280 --> 00:47:34,200
Well, Justin, I'm glad you asked.

1000
00:47:34,200 --> 00:47:35,200
God damn it.

1001
00:47:35,200 --> 00:47:37,640
This is going to be the longest episode ever now.

1002
00:47:37,640 --> 00:47:40,760
The bee dog touches us all.

1003
00:47:40,760 --> 00:47:44,960
In our life, we are touched by the bee dog in ways you can't even begin to imagine.

1004
00:47:44,960 --> 00:47:45,960
Why is it there?

1005
00:47:45,960 --> 00:47:46,960
I don't understand.

1006
00:47:46,960 --> 00:47:50,840
It's not just this email, though, it's the past like three or four emails there's been

1007
00:47:50,840 --> 00:47:56,180
a bee dog at the bottom and we've never, we've just like ignored it, but been aware of it.

1008
00:47:56,180 --> 00:47:57,920
I've embraced the bee dog love.

1009
00:47:57,920 --> 00:47:59,280
I've embraced the warm love.

1010
00:47:59,280 --> 00:48:02,080
Is it the same bee dog every time and I've just been missing this?

1011
00:48:02,080 --> 00:48:04,520
No, no, no, but it usually is a pug.

1012
00:48:04,520 --> 00:48:06,520
It almost certainly is a pug bee dog.

1013
00:48:06,520 --> 00:48:07,880
Well, they make the best bee dogs.

1014
00:48:07,880 --> 00:48:09,400
They have bee like features, right?

1015
00:48:09,400 --> 00:48:13,080
They got that tiny little nubby tail, looks like a stinger.

1016
00:48:13,080 --> 00:48:17,920
I think I don't like, the only problem I have with the bee dog is that it's sort of-

1017
00:48:17,920 --> 00:48:18,920
Is nothing?

1018
00:48:18,920 --> 00:48:19,920
You have no problem with the bee dog?

1019
00:48:19,920 --> 00:48:20,920
No, no, no.

1020
00:48:20,920 --> 00:48:24,420
It's looking at me while I'm trying to record the show and saying, I'm effortlessly funnier

1021
00:48:24,420 --> 00:48:28,080
than you.

1022
00:48:28,080 --> 00:48:31,840
What I am doing is funnier than the thing you are doing right now just by being in this

1023
00:48:31,840 --> 00:48:32,840
costume.

1024
00:48:32,840 --> 00:48:36,240
See, when I look at the bee dog, what I see is him saying, don't worry.

1025
00:48:36,240 --> 00:48:37,800
I got it.

1026
00:48:37,800 --> 00:48:38,800
Whatever that might be.

1027
00:48:38,800 --> 00:48:39,800
I got this.

1028
00:48:39,800 --> 00:48:40,800
It doesn't matter.

1029
00:48:40,800 --> 00:48:41,800
I got this thing for you.

1030
00:48:41,800 --> 00:48:47,300
I just think about what pug nectar tastes like and his bad, his bad thing.

1031
00:48:47,300 --> 00:48:51,040
Don't forget to pre-order shirts.

1032
00:48:51,040 --> 00:48:56,800
If you want a sweatshirt, you're going to help raise money for Big Brothers, Big Sisters,

1033
00:48:56,800 --> 00:48:59,420
and you need to pre-order one of those if you want them.

1034
00:48:59,420 --> 00:49:05,420
So I'm not sure how much longer we are doing pre-orders, need to probably figure that out,

1035
00:49:05,420 --> 00:49:08,560
but act fast because it won't be long.

1036
00:49:08,560 --> 00:49:12,520
If you order right away, you can make sure to get your order by Christmas time.

1037
00:49:12,520 --> 00:49:16,160
So go do that right now at bmbam.com.

1038
00:49:16,160 --> 00:49:21,160
You can see the link on the right hand side with all our mugs and shirts and all that

1039
00:49:21,160 --> 00:49:22,160
crap.

1040
00:49:22,160 --> 00:49:23,160
So, Griffin.

He can't like, no one can topple him from this throne that he has built using his own

1043
00:49:34,200 --> 00:49:38,240
two hands and clay as the showstopper.

1044
00:49:38,240 --> 00:49:39,240
That's his new name.

1045
00:49:39,240 --> 00:49:40,240
Jacob Locker, the showstopper.

1046
00:49:40,240 --> 00:49:42,600
Wow, that's got a nice kind of rhythm to it.

1047
00:49:42,600 --> 00:49:43,600
Yeah, I like it a lot.

1048

This one was sent in by Yahoo Answers, er, it was by Yahoo Answers user, Lynn Craven,

1049
00:49:50,760 --> 00:49:56,280
who asks, does a fart contain DNA?

1050
00:49:56,280 --> 00:49:59,280
I'm Justin McElroy.

1051
00:49:59,280 --> 00:50:02,280
I'm Travis McElroy.

1052
00:50:02,280 --> 00:50:04,600
I'm Griffin.

1053
00:50:04,600 --> 00:50:22,840
This has been my brother, my brother, may he kiss your dad square on the lips.
