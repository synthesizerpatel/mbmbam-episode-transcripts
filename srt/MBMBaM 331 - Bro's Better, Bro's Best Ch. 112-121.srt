1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there will know how cool they are for listening.

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:45,000
What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Well folks, welcome to My Brother, My Brother, Me, an advice show for the modern era. I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy.

6
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
I'm your middle-est brother, Travis McElroy.

7
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Crickets. That's right, Griffin is not here. He had a baby, and he's doing the dad thing, as they say.

8
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Yeah, as everybody says, you know, that old saying, doing the dad thing.

9
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
You know the old saying, doing the dad thing?

10
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:12,000
So what we have for you instead is a bountiful selection of delicious, best-of, greatest hits.

11
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,000
We're sorry to do another one of these so close to the last one, but them's babies, okay?

12
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Them's the babies.

13
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Them's the babies, folks.

14
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:24,000
We should also say, I guess, Griffin and Rachel are both doing great. Their baby, Henry, is doing good.

15
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Everybody's doing well, so you know, everything's going pretty smoothly for them.

16
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Henry is absolutely beautiful with big, wise eyes.

17
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Wise baby.

18
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
That baby's got an old soul, I can already tell.

19
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Maybe too old. Maybe an ancient one. Who knows?

20
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,000
It could be an ancient dark soul. It's impossible to say.

21
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Who knows?

22
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Who knows? Anyway, here come the hits.

23
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
These are the hits, folks. Drink it in.

24
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:59,000
This Yahoo answer was sent in by Kate Stull. Thank you, Kate.

25
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,000
It's by Yahoo Answers user, Humphrey, who asks,

26
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Will I ever need to wear my cap and gown again? I just graduated this year. What to do with the robe and cap?

27
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:14,000
I was wondering if I would ever have an occasion to wear it again, so that I should spend $35 on dry cleaning.

28
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
It's not cheap to dry clean the stupid robe.

29
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:21,000
My college regalia colors are different from my high school regalia colors, and I doubt that I could wear it to my college graduation ceremony.

30
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:25,000
I was wondering if any of the following events would require a cap and gown or even permit me to wear one.

31
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:30,000
And what would I wear to these different events? I will probably be attending this coming year. Am I clueless?

32
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
And then there's some...

33
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Alright, list the events. We'll vote.

34
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Thesis, presentation, and defense.

35
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
I do not know what that is.

36
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,000
It sounds like a power play, though, to wear a cap and gown.

37
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,000
A formal academic award ceremony.

38
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Just the cap.

39
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
And nothing else?

40
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Nothing else.

41
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Now that's a brave look. Tell me about that.

42
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:56,000
What it says is that I graduated from the University of Fuckin'.

43
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:02,000
What about just robe?

44
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
I got my magna cum laude.

45
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:08,000
What about just robe?

46
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Cinched.

47
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Oh, rolled up sleeves to the shoulder.

48
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
So you're showing the guns.

49
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,000
I like to see some black jeans underneath a robe.

50
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
That's a really cool look.

51
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Him it up. Him it up. Cinch it with a belt. Him it. Black jeans.

52
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,000
No shirt. No shirt.

53
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
You got a tunic, basically, or a blouse.

54
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,000
And have it open to the navel.

55
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Fraternity party.

56
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:37,000
It depends on the theme, right?

57
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:43,000
But if you do it, you have to wear it to every fraternity party so people start to know you as the robester.

58
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Oh, that's nice. Robespierre.

59
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Robespierre is here.

60
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Could you be Professor Beer Hands?

61
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Your hands would need to be made of beer.

62
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Have you guys ever heard of Edward Forty Hands?

63
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Yes, I've heard of Edward Forty Hands.

64
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Please, Professor Beer Hands is my father. Call me Edward.

65
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:05,000
I feel like Professor Beer Hands was invented right after I got out of college,

66
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:09,000
which is a shame because it seems like the kind of problem-solving I could really get into.

67
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,000
I have to tell you, it sounds like hipster legend.

68
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:16,000
I don't believe anybody actually does Edward Forty Hands.

69
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Can you imagine doing Edward Forty Hands and then you get a phone call?

70
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Or there's a knock on the door.

71
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Or how about you've just consumed 80 ounces of liquid

72
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:30,000
and you need to pass it through your body via penis or vagina?

73
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:34,000
What's the next step there? Tell me where that terminates.

74
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:38,000
You just start smacking at your zipper, I assume.

75
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,000
And hope that luck comes into play.

76
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:45,000
If I find I'm going to be in an uncomfortable scenario,

77
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:50,000
sometimes one of the tricks I do is I try to learn more about the scenario than anybody there.

78
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,000
So I can try to make myself the most...

79
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Get super deep into etiquette for male strippers.

80
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:01,000
What is off-limits, what is good, what is not?

81
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:05,000
No, no, no. Okay, Susan, you'd have a dollar for each ball.

82
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:08,000
It's a dollar per ball, Susan.

83
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:12,000
You looked right into his spread, but you can't...

84
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Instead of move the male strippers to...

85
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,000
He parted them for you, you know that.

86
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
He parted them, it's five dollars.

87
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
I know what you're going to love.

88
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:31,000
There's a part of the show where he spreads his butt cheeks and stands motionless for 15 minutes.

89
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:37,000
And you throw Skittles. It's like a carnival game.

90
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:42,000
You're not actually supposed to look for more than 20 seconds at a time.

91
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Or else it loses its specialness.

92
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Actually, no one's supposed to look. If you look, he leaves.

93
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
He scampers off.

94
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Oh, you spooked him, Sheila.

95
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:58,000
He starts any time someone looks inside his spread bow.

96
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
He starts the timer over again.

97
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:04,000
People die of hydration this way.

98
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Somebody look. God damn it, Christy.

99
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
God damn it, I gotta start again.

100
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:16,000
One, two. No one look at my spread butthole.

101
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Isn't that the plot of Magic Mike?

102
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:26,000
It's basically the first hour and 45 minutes are him trying to get through the 15 minute spread butthole.

103
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
No, it's an interactive film.

104
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:31,000
It's just Stockard Channing.

105
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:35,000
When it's on the honor system, you have to push the button connected to your seat.

106
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:39,000
It is just Stockard Channing's spread butthole on the screen.

107
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Yes, Mom and Dad, I do want to pursue acting.

108
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:46,000
And I'm sorry, but I'm quitting my day job as the usher that has demanded the audience to major.

109
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,000
No one looks at Channing Tatum's spread butthole.

110
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
I said Stockard Channing.

111
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Yes, you said Stockard Channing.

112
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Stockard Channing doesn't hurt me.

113
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:58,000
You said Stockard Channing's spread butthole.

114
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
You son of a bitch.

115
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,000
You conjured that image into existence with your words.

116
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Throw up.

117
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Now everyone is thinking about Stockard Channing's spread butthole.

118
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,000
It's your fucking fault.

119
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:22,000
You actually said it and I went through this montage similar to Showgirls where Stockard Channing is training Channing Tatum.

120
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:28,000
No, you've got to spread it like this to really get the soldier vitriol up.

121
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Your humor is all out of whack, Channo.

122
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Take it from me.

123
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:38,000
You know that's not the first time that switch has happened.

124
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Oh, Christ.

125
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,000
I think horses might be on some next level shit.

126
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
They're like the dolphins of the land.

127
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
They're like land dolphins.

128
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
They're basically land dolphins.

129
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Hey, do you want to go down to land dolphin races and lay some bets?

130
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Me neither. That seems inhumane.

131
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Let's just let them run free.

132
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Why don't we have dolphin races? Just side note.

133
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Yeah, dolphin races would be fresh.

134
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
I'd really rather watch that than horse races.

135
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:08,000
I think it's because creating on-sea seating is so daunting.

136
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Because everyone who would want to watch dolphins races is fat.

137
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:14,000
I don't know how you would buoy them.

138
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:17,000
You would need mermaid jockeys, probably.

139
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:22,000
If I said dolphin jockey, that kind of sounds like a racist slur, maybe.

140
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Yeah.

141
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Or something you call a scuba diver if you don't know what that is very good.

142
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Maybe some sort of islander. I don't know.

143
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Maybe it's like a Tongan racial slur.

144
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
I don't know. I do not know that that...

145
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
I don't think it's...

146
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
It's like somebody who's not from the island.

147
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:47,000
You mean like they put the pineapple on top of their beef?

148
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
You know, like, oh, you don't put the beef on the pineapple.

149
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
You dolphin jockey.

150
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Yeah.

151
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Go back to the mainland.

152
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Is that your islander impression, Justin?

153
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Yeah, you just say everything slow.

154
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Go back to the mainland, dolphin jockey.

155
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:10,000
You sound like you've lost the ability to have inflection in your voice.

156
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Yeah, if the Caribbean had like a deep south and also you were drunk.

157
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Take your banana republic polo and your ability to modulate your voice tone back to the mainland, dolphin jockey.

158
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Now that's becoming like a Charlton Heston islander.

159
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Well, he played it in the sixties.

160
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
It was a crazy time.

161
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:42,000
They got Charlton Heston. It was like Genghis Khan and John Wayne.

162
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,000
You know, they got a white man to play an ethnic role.

163
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:48,000
It was highly, highly offensive.

164
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:57,000
I need to stop you both right here because I don't think either of you have watched a hip hop music video in the past 15 fucking years

165
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:02,000
because I do not think popping and locking it is still a thing that is commonplace.

166
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:07,000
I do not think in a new Chris Brown video people are moving like robots.

167
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Are people still busting a move?

168
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
That is no, no.

169
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
They drop it like it's hot?

170
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Young MC took that one to the fucking grave, dog.

171
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:18,000
They take it to the floor and touch their toes.

172
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,000
Now put some cardboard on the floor and spin around real fast.

173
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Oh yeah, did they do that headspin thing where like they kind of...

174
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
Pardon me.

175
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Do I do it like a tornado?

176
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Teacher, would you like to see my tootsie roll?

177
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
Nope, nope.

178
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
I wouldn't because it's fucking 2012.

179
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
It is not 1999 anymore.

180
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:43,000
I don't need you to teach me how to dougie, but I would appreciate some notes on how to improve it.

181
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
Ah, Charlie Brown.

182
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
Nope, it's not.

183
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
It's super not.

184
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Psst, when do we start working on the electric slide?

185
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
We never did.

186
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Never will.

187
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
Never did that.

188
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,000
Can't.

189
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
It was never a thing.

190
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
Excuse me, teach.

191
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:05,000
Can you teach me how to do that move that the guy in the fishing hat does where he shakes his head really fast and it looks like he's vibrating?

192
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:08,000
I think it's in Breaking 2.

193
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,000
Teach.

194
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,000
Teach.

195
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:14,000
When do we start the partner work with the brooms?

196
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,000
What?

197
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,000
What are you talking about?

198
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,000
Is that in Breaking 2?

199
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:21,000
Are you in Fantasia?

200
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Well, no, but now, yes.

201
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:29,000
When do we get the lesson about dancing on the ceiling?

202
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
That's going to go on and on.

203
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:35,000
Teach, when do we start the Jamiroquai work?

204
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:38,000
Now, Friday we have a Jamiroquai workshop.

205
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:43,000
We do have the room where the floor is a giant treadmill, so everyone, we're going to have a lot of fun.

206
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,000
Yeah.

207
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
Don't bring your bags in, please.

208
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:53,000
Do not bring your bags, but do bring in your gigantic hats like Mr. Jamiroquai would wear.

209
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:57,000
Did you guys know that the lead singer of Jamiroquai was just named Jamiroquai and it was just him?

210
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
Now, is that true?

211
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,000
No.

212
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,000
Why did you lie?

213
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
He was actually the last of the Jamiroquai Indians.

214
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,000
Exactly.

215
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
What?

216
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
Oh, Christ.

217
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:13,000
Do you think that metaphorically, like, when we look back at college and think of all the times we didn't get it.

218
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,000
Yeah.

219
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:20,000
And you're like, ugh, do you think that's what, like, all of life is like that metaphorically?

220
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:28,000
Like, if you're not getting it, it's so, the difference between college and the life I'm living right now, this is what I'm saying.

221
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:36,000
The difference between college and the life I'm in right now is similar to the difference between, is relatable metaphorically, the difference between being alive and being dead.

222
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,000
It's basically what I'm saying.

223
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,000
Yeah.

224
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
Do you think that's an accurate metaphor?

225
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,000
I don't think it's-

226
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:54,000
I bet that Hell is just, like, a series of being able to watch, like, completely watch on, like, television or on a giant movie screen, those moments, and then, like, having a pop-up video that's like, bloop.

227
00:12:54,000 --> 00:13:04,000
If he would have done this, then this was the million dollar idea that would have changed his life, or it would have been the most amazing night of his life, but he didn't because he was chicken shit.

228
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:09,000
Hey, if you'd ordered the Panang curry, Steve Buscemi would have heard, and he'd be like, oh, bro, that's my fave.

229
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,000
Let's party down.

230
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
And then he would have been best friends with Buscemi.

231
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
Yeah, and that is, I guess, life's ultimate achievement.

232
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
What the fuck are you talking about?

233
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,000
I regret-

234
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
I'm just saying it's a cool thing that's gonna happen.

235
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,000
My life is perfect right now.

236
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:26,000
I have a great podcast and family and girlfriend and job, but man, me and Buscemi were buds.

237
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
What if Buscemi were your roommate?

238
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:32,000
Oh, god, I would forsake everything to be a Buscemi bud.

239
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:35,000
You fucking idiots.

240
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:47,000
I'm sorry that you don't live satisfying lives and that you need a trap-toothed actor to help you find satisfaction.

241
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:50,000
I'm gonna tell Sydney all this shit that you said, and Teresa.

242
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
You don't have to, please, listen.

243
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:59,000
Listen, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, I love you, but I love, love Buscemi.

244
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:03,000
I just feel like there's a Buscemi-shaped hole in my hood.

245
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:07,000
It was for Sydney's sake that I didn't pick, like, a girl or something.

246
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:12,000
Like, I didn't say, like, and then Kathleen Turner would hear, and you would get totally crazy.

247
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:16,000
So, wait, in your mind, Kathleen Turner is the female version of Steve Buscemi?

248
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
Like, their equivalent?

249
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
Right, exactly.

250
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
Oh, Christ.

251
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
You could do toys.

252
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:36,000
Like, I've got in my cubicle a Harry Houdini bobblehead, a Superman bust, and a donkey figurine from Shrek that talks.

253
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
Go fuck yourself.

254
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
What? Why? Griffin?

255
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:43,000
No, Travis, you're an adult.

256
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
I am an adult. I'm an adult that works at a theater.

257
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:50,000
You're gonna be somebody's husband soon, and you have a Shrek toy on your desk where you work.

258
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:54,000
He talks. He says, like, you know what it's really nice? Parfaits.

259
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
You know when someone says, you want parfaits?

260
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
He says, hell no, I don't want no parfaits. Parfaits are delicious.

261
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
It's hilarious.

262
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
That was word for word.

263
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:08,000
You have used this toy so much that you have memorized that entire soliloquy.

264
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
It's great. It's a good thing.

265
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
And he also makes jokes about Shrek farting.

266
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
He says, like, shoo, Shrek.

267
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
You used to rip one off.

268
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
I'm mouth-opening everything.

269
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
It's pretty great.

270
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
I'm just saying.

271
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
It's just a pretty good thing.

272
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
Justin spit coffee all over his keyboard.

273
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
He had to go.

274
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
Did he really?

275
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
Yeah, he's cleaning it up now.

276
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
Um, okay.

277
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
Um, what an idiot.

278
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
You're so dumb.

279
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
You're a stupid Shrek doll.

280
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
Hey, do you have any creative ideas for fundraisers?

281
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:45,000
I'm raising money to spend two years in Nicaragua.

282
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:48,000
Volunteering, and I'm a little short of my goal.

283
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
Thanks, Evidee.

284
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:54,000
Can you kickstart a Nicaragua trip?

285
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
You can kickstart pretty much.

286
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:03,000
If I wanted to go to Hardee's, but I didn't want to pay, like, the four bucks for a sandwich of sausage and eggs,

287
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
then I could kickstart that.

288
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:08,000
Let's kickstart a My Brother, My Brother, and Me Hardee's party.

289
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:12,000
And it's basically like, however much money we get, that's how many people...

290
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:15,000
Okay, to start, we need $500,000 to build a Hardee's.

291
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
What? There's a Hardee's in Route 60.

292
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
You guys have Hardee's here?

293
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
We'll need at least...

294
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:27,000
I think we're in pretty good with Andrew WK, so he'll probably cut us a pretty sweet deal to record a version of his song

295
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:30,000
when it's time to party, we will party hard-ease.

296
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:35,000
My Brother, My Brother, and Me breakfast fundraising experience.

297
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
We will party hard-ease.

298
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:41,000
What are the California raisins doing?

299
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,000
Will they come back?

300
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:46,000
I will put on a garbage bag and dress like a California raisin for you.

301
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
This is gonna be a really good party.

302
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,000
I'm really excited about this.

303
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
You guys, this is gonna be, like, a super bad party.

304
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,000
You're welcome.

305
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
I went to my super bad party.

306
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
It was at a Hardee's on Route 60.

307
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
They had a little slide-ease.

308
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,000
It was awesome.

309
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
It was a little arty farty.

310
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:04,000
What are we doing?

311
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,000
I mean, it's Hardee's.

312
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:08,000
It's no Sardee's, but it was a Hardee's party.

313
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:11,000
Just don't be tardy.

314
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,000
For Christ's sake, move on.

315
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,000
Get a ride with my friend Marty to the Hardee's party.

316
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:22,000
My friend Marty erased all my pictures.

317
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:25,000
Creative ideas for fundraisers.

318
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:29,000
I think if I saw a grown woman selling lemonade, that would be pretty crazy.

319
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:33,000
I think I would probably donate to her because I'd assume she had fallen on hard times.

320
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
Especially if some of the letters were backwards.

321
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
Oh, no.

322
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:40,000
She put, like, womenade.

323
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,000
Wait, not women.

324
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
Womenade is a fundraising goal.

325
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:51,000
I actually think you could be arrested for selling womenade on the street.

326
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:55,000
Excuse me, you got a permit for this, womenade?

327
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,000
You sound adorable, officer.

328
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,000
No, I mean...

329
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
Is lemonade...

330
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
Is lemonade sold by women?

331
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,000
What is it?

332
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:06,000
I thought it was lemonade sold for women.

333
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:09,000
Like, made of them.

334
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:14,000
Like, you put a spigot in the side of a woman and womenade comes out.

335
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,000
It's adorable.

336
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,000
It's 100% pure, fresh lemonade.

337
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
Guys, this is like...

338
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:23,000
I feel like a new energy beverage, a new vitamin water is invented every week,

339
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:27,000
and womenade is our fucking meal ticket.

340
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,000
I know.

341
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
Womenade is the...

342
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,000
Here's what it's got.

343
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
It's got a natural balance of electrolytes.

344
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
It's gonna help you rehydrate.

345
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:38,000
It's also got estrogen, because that's something that's in ladies.

346
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
Here's what you do.

347
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:45,000
B12 and whatever is in red wine that makes you not get Alzheimer's.

348
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
You gotta...

349
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:51,000
You take a regular Country Time lemonade, you cut it with water,

350
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:55,000
because vitamin drinks can't taste as good as normal drinks.

351
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,000
Right.

352
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:00,000
And then you throw a one-a-day women's supplement in there.

353
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,000
That's so gay.

354
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
And then just a dash of red wine.

355
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
Guys, let me throw this out, let me eat you with this.

356
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,000
Okay.

357
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
The spokesperson, Ray Liotta.

358
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
Ray Liotta for womenade.

359
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:13,000
That's a brave choice.

360
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
That seems pretty cut and dry.

361
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,000
I don't like it.

362
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
It's too obvious.

363
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:23,000
What women these days are so concerned about is osteoporosis.

364
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:26,000
So womenade does have ground up bones in it.

365
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,000
Yeah.

366
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,000
So you can get your calcium.

367
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
It's the chunks that let you know it's working.

368
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
It does make it a little mealy.

369
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,000
It makes it sort of sludge-like.

370
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:37,000
Hey guys, what would you think of this as like a mascot?

371
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:41,000
The little animated baby from Ally McBeal.

372
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:44,000
I love it.

373
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:48,000
Your biological clock's ticking and it's counting down to womenade time.

374
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:53,000
Crack open a fresh womenade with the baby from Ally McBeal and Ray Liotta.

375
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,000
Our spokespeople.

376
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,000
Get out of here, baby.

377
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,000
You're creeping me out.

378
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:01,000
This is Ray Liotta's voice.

379
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:06,000
They promised him that they were going to CGI the baby in later, but they never did.

380
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:09,000
Did you see that fucking womenade commercial?

381
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,000
Ray Liotta's losing it.

382
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:13,000
I'm losing my mind over this.

383
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:16,000
Look at him with his little diaper.

384
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,000
Doing that little dance.

385
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,000
What do you call that, baby?

386
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,000
Hey baby, get back here.

387
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,000
Hey, hold this drink for a second, baby.

388
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:26,000
I got a bitch womenade.

389
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
Got to sell the people on it.

390
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,000
Ooga chaka.

391
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,000
Right, baby?

392
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,000
Ooga chaka.

393
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,000
Right, baby?

394
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,000
Remember that?

395
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,000
Remember when you appeared in McNichol?

396
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,000
Man, I love that show.

397
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:43,000
I feel like womenade idea is going to make us a lot of money.

398
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:51,000
So the neighborhood that our company house where all of our young actors live is not a nice neighborhood.

399
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:58,000
And the other day they were telling me that this group of young people was just throwing rocks at cars.

400
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:04,000
Like on the street, not even cars driving by, just parked cars on the street, just throwing rocks at them.

401
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,000
Can we-

402
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,000
Why?

403
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:12,000
Before we jump to any conclusions, are we sure that those cars didn't ask those children to throw rocks at them?

404
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
Kind of Knight Rider situation.

405
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,000
What?

406
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:19,000
The Knight Rider where the cars are talking to them and asking them to throw rocks at them.

407
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,000
You know Knight Rider.

408
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,000
You know Knight Ritter.

409
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,000
Knight Rider.

410
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:25,000
With John Ritter.

411
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:30,000
It's just John Ritter giving David Hasselhoff piggyback rides.

412
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,000
Ritter Rider.

413
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,000
Did you guys see that episode of Ritter Rider?

414
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,000
Yeah.

415
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,000
I love that one.

416
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,000
Oh my God.

417
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:46,000
Sorry, I just had the vision of John Ritter voiced by Mr. Feeny and I'm going to have a rod all day now.

418
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,000
Perfect.

419
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,000
That's going to really impede my work day.

420
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:56,000
My girlfriend and I knew exactly almost what time her ring was going to be available.

421
00:21:56,000 --> 00:22:00,000
She knew it was happening and said to me, if you wait, I will kill you.

422
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,000
Okay.

423
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,000
Right.

424
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,000
So I proposed as soon as I got home, which was fine.

425
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,000
It was very nice for us.

426
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:08,000
Got down to one knee, did Sets of Romance and things, bought her flowers.

427
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,000
Very nice.

428
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:15,000
And then I had to spend the rest of time explaining to people why I didn't do something more surprising.

429
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,000
Sure.

430
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,000
Now here's the counter counterpoint.

431
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,000
Who wants to get married?

432
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,000
Bond, chain, milk, milk, milk.

433
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,000
Don't milk the cow.

434
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,000
You can go out and get it.

435
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:30,000
You don't have to tie yourself down with a, don't just fry free on that hot air balloon

436
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,000
because you don't need a sandbag tying you down.

437
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,000
Let's go seed.

438
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:36,000
Let's go sow your seeds in a field of pussies.

439
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,000
I don't remember that scene from the UHS.

440
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,000
Wait a minute.

441
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,000
Stop the world.

442
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,000
I want to get off.

443
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:46,000
Wait, did you just say sow your seed in a field of pussies?

444
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:49,000
What kind of ship are you running here?

445
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,000
Sow your wild oats in the pussy dirt.

446
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,000
It's not a ship, it's a farm, obviously.

447
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,000
Pussy farm.

448
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:57,000
Zynga's new Facebook hit.

449
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:05,000
Come water my pussy so I can get 30 pussy coins.

450
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,000
Have you seen my pussy cow?

451
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:11,000
I think it wandered onto your Facebook farm.

452
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:17,000
Give us $30, we'll give you 600 zynga points and you can use it to buy new pussy cows.

453
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:21,000
Oh, the pussy wolf came and snuck into your farm and ate all your rutabagas.

454
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:24,000
You pussy bagas.

455
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:28,000
Our wolves are vegetarian.

456
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,000
Don't steal that in your Facebook game.

457
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,000
We'll sue you.

458
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:38,000
Come on down to zynga ranch for all the milk for the pussy cows.

459
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,000
Ready to move on.

460
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:47,000
There was a lot of, I guess it's good that we do a split every now and then because we usually talk about boners a lot,

461
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:53,000
but there was a lot of discussion of the vagina and its parts in this particular episode.

462
00:23:53,000 --> 00:24:00,000
Griffin, the one thing that you should have learned from Mexico is no regrets.

463
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:03,000
Which is also the Romney campaign slogan.

464
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:04,000
No regrets.

465
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,000
Full speed ahead.

466
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,000
Never look back, Romney, 2012.

467
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:09,000
Fuck it, it's like my 12th time trying this.

468
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:11,000
I have nothing left to lose.

469
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:12,000
You want to see my taxes?

470
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,000
I want to see the future.

471
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,000
Why is everybody?

472
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:17,000
Why are you in the past?

473
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:20,000
I want to talk about how much money I'm going to make next year.

474
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:25,000
That's what I'm looking forward to, which is why I've hired a baby to be my vice president.

475
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:26,000
Come on, baby.

476
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,000
We're going to the future.

477
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,000
Come on, baby VP.

478
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:37,000
Okay, how would you not vote? I don't agree with Mr. Romney's politics.

479
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:43,000
If he did put a baby on the ticket, what if he actually showed the baby sitting on a ticket?

480
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:48,000
And you did like, Romney was at his podium, and then you had a small baby podium next to it.

481
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:52,000
Then you put a baby dressed like Mitt Romney with a Mitt Romney wig on.

482
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:55,000
And he's wearing a toupee.

483
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:57,000
I would vote for that.

484
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:58,000
Hey, Romney, if you're listening, you're welcome.

485
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:02,000
Just imagine that VP debate, too, right?

486
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:06,000
Because you would have our VP whose name escapes me.

487
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,000
His what? Sorry?

488
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:12,000
His name escapes me at the moment.

489
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,000
Oh, man, you know.

490
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,000
Joey B.

491
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:17,000
You know the guy?

492
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:18,000
Joey B.

493
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:21,000
Joey Bag of Donuts is up there.

494
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:23,000
Joey Bag of Donuts, eh?

495
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:26,000
He's doing his thing up there.

496
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,000
I can't remember the goddamn vice president's name.

497
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:31,000
I've been out of the country more days than I've been in the country.

498
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:34,000
Don't you have to take a test to get back into the country?

499
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,000
This is hugely embarrassing.

500
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,000
I'm pretty sure it's Joey Flip.

501
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,000
Is it not Joey Flip?

502
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:41,000
Flip Wilson?

503
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:45,000
Flip Wilson, vice president and known cross-dresser, Flip Wilson.

504
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:51,000
Okay, I want to see a VP debate with Joseph Gordon-Biden.

505
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:55,000
Yo, he was so good on Third Rock from the Sun.

506
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:57,000
I love his work in Brick.

507
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:58,000
He was so good in that.

508
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:59,000
I want him up there.

509
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:01,000
I want a baby up there.

510
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:03,000
And one of them is going to poop his pants,

511
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:09,000
but the other one is going to say something offensive accidentally about the gay community.

512
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:10,000
And it's going to be great.

513
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,000
Which one was which? I don't know.

514
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:13,000
It could really go either way.

515
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:14,000
He pays your money.

516
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,000
He takes your chances.

517
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:17,000
Let's get into the advice.

518
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:21,000
I just forgot the vice president's fucking name for two and a half minutes.

519
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:24,000
You're not even like an American anymore, really.

520
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:28,000
Oh, damn it, Facebook.

521
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:31,000
Here's the truth about the Facebook.

522
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:34,000
It's sort of my whole – it's not just for me.

523
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:35,000
It's not just Facebook.

524
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:36,000
It's life, you know?

525
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:37,000
Uh-oh.

526
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:39,000
You got that right, Matthew McCullough.

527
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:41,000
No, listen.

528
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:44,000
Let's get these stinky, sticky bongos out.

529
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:47,000
Let's rap about this.

530
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:53,000
Fucking – how is anyone ever supposed to miss you if you're always there?

531
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:57,000
Are you saying to disappear for a while?

532
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:02,000
Was that on the – was that on the tweet stream of quotes from The Notebook?

533
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,000
Because I do follow that, too.

534
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,000
Hey, listen, for real, listen.

535
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,000
If you're a bird, I'm a bird.

536
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,000
Fuck.

537
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:14,000
I'm going to puke.

538
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:15,000
Fuck.

539
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:16,000
Listen, seriously, for real.

540
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:17,000
Listen, but seriously.

541
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:19,000
Listen, for real.

542
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:25,000
This is F-R-E-A-L life lesson.

543
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:32,000
How – like, if you're always tweeting and booking and LinkedIning about everything you do,

544
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,000
no one's going to give a shit.

545
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,000
You got to compress.

546
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,000
And even then, nobody gives a shit about anything you do.

547
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:42,000
The reason that your friend gets all these likes is because he says something broad.

548
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,000
He says something that means something to everybody, not just him.

549
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,000
Went to five guys today.

550
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,000
Too many fries.

551
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,000
Zero likes.

552
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,000
Because everybody likes fries.

553
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,000
No likes, no shares.

554
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:55,000
Do you know why?

555
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:57,000
Because everybody went to fucking five guys today.

556
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:58,000
Yep.

557
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:59,000
You know what?

558
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:01,000
I'm going to drop some Carnegie on you.

559
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:02,000
Here we go.

560
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:11,000
You can win more friends in two weeks of getting interested in other people

561
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:17,000
than you can in two years of trying to get other people interested in you.

562
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:19,000
Oh, God.

563
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:25,000
If you put up a Facebook status that is about your life and how much it blows slash rules,

564
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:27,000
I don't like either one of those.

565
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:28,000
If it rules, I feel jealous.

566
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,000
If it blows, I feel empathy.

567
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,000
I don't like either of those emotions.

568
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:39,000
If you put on your status like, five o'clock somewhere, you know I like that because I'm into that.

569
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:41,000
I feel that.

570
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:43,000
I'm with you on that.

571
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:48,000
Or get engaged because that's what I did and I got fucking like 350 likes in two hours.

572
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,000
I love this.

573
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:53,000
Travis, you have just given birth to the king of ideas.

574
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:54,000
Cracked it.

575
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:55,000
Get engaged.

576
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:56,000
Or just every...

577
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:59,000
And then end it and get engaged again on cycle.

578
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:02,000
That's a little extreme, but there are a ton...

579
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,000
Opened up my new business today.

580
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,000
Three days later, business went under.

581
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:07,000
Should have had a better plan.

582
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:10,000
Anyone know good music to listen to?

583
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,000
And then say like, pray for me.

584
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,000
Pray for me.

585
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:17,000
I've got to go pray on it like, oh my God.

586
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:21,000
Anybody got any choice quotes about prayer and its meaning and value?

587
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:25,000
Anyone got some sweet bibble verses for me?

588
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:26,000
Need them.

589
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,000
Last weekend was my birthday.

590
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:29,000
Happy birthday.

591
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:30,000
No, no.

592
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:31,000
Happy birthday, Justin.

593
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:32,000
Not me.

594
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:33,000
Like, like, like.

595
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:35,000
Like, like, like, like, like.

596
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:38,000
I'm going to share that with all my business friends.

597
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:39,000
Oh.

598
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:40,000
Like, like, like, like.

599
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:46,000
One idea, find a picture of an old guy in a military outfit and then say, this was my

600
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:47,000
pop-pop.

601
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:50,000
He passed away this week or something like that.

602
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:51,000
Like, like, like.

603
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:52,000
Like, like, like.

604
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:56,000
People like him and my G-MAR high school sweethearts.

605
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:57,000
People are going to like that.

606
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:58,000
Like crazy.

607
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:59,000
This is my G-Paw.

608
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:00,000
Red blood Americans.

609
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,000
This is my G-Paw in the war.

610
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:03,000
I want...

611
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:05,000
I like how your G-Paw looks.

612
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:08,000
I want to be his LinkedIn professional buddy.

613
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:09,000
Like, like, like.

614
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:11,000
I want to buddy link with him.

615
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:12,000
Like, like, like.

616
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:15,000
I'd name my farm bill after my G-Paw.

617
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:16,000
Like, like, like, like.

618
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,000
I retweeted your grandpa's pussy farm.

619
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,000
Like, like, like, like.

620
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,000
You guys are going to hear a great joke.

621
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:23,000
It's on Yahoo.

622
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:24,000
Okay.

623
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,000
Justin Cain sent it in.

624
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:27,000
I've never read a Yahoo joke before.

625
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:28,000
We'll see how it works.

626
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:33,000
Ronnie says, how do you make a horse laugh then cry?

627
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:34,000
Uh-huh.

628
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:38,000
To make a horse laugh, you go up to the horse and whisper in their ear, my dick is bigger

629
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:39,000
than yours.

630
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:44,000
To make a horse cry, the guy shows him his penis and it was bigger.

631
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:49,000
That is a pretty...

632
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:52,000
That almost beats my Pika joke.

633
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:53,000
Almost.

634
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:54,000
Comes close.

635
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:55,000
Yeah.

636
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:58,000
The top answer on that says horses don't care about penis size.

637
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:59,000
Bullshit, they don't.

638
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:01,000
They don't even speak English, you guys.

639
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:06,000
You don't evolve penises that big without some sort of underlying biological impairment.

640
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,000
Biological imperative.

641
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:11,000
But that's some sort of John Hodgman.

642
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:14,000
And a man with a penis larger than a horse is to be pitied.

643
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:19,000
He will never have a full erection and could not lay with a woman even if he could.

644
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:20,000
Weird.

645
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:21,000
Yes.

646
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:27,000
Now, Griffin had a pretty good bit where he used to come up to you and say, is there

647
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:29,000
a baker under your bed?

648
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:31,000
And you would say, no.

649
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:34,000
And then Griffin would say, have you checked?

650
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:37,000
And you would say, no.

651
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:41,000
And then Griffin would say, then how do you know there is not a baker under your bed?

652
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:43,000
For some people, it was adorable and hilarious.

653
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:45,000
For me, it was terrifying.

654
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:47,000
And I often lived in fear of being baked.

655
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:50,000
Because they were in bunk beds and Griffin would hang his head down at four o'clock

656
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:53,000
in the morning and shout this into Travis's face.

657
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:59,000
I have a confession that I need to get off my chest after probably 22 years.

658
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:00,000
Okay.

659
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,000
Oh, wow.

660
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:05,000
I stole the baker under your bed joke from the movie Rocket Man.

661
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:07,000
Wait a minute.

662
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:14,000
I stole probably my most, the joke that whenever you talk about how funny a kid I was, I stole

663
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:17,000
that shit from Harlan Williams.

664
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:18,000
Took it right from him.

665
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:22,000
Are you telling me this?

666
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:23,000
I hate you so much.

667
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:24,000
Took it right from him.

668
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:25,000
I hate your fuck.

669
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:26,000
Are you serious?

670
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:30,000
10 years old, you thought, oh my god, this kid's on another level.

671
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:31,000
Nope.

672
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:34,000
You know who is on another level is Harlan Williams.

673
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:38,000
Well, he's on another level for a 10-year-old.

674
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:41,000
That's great because when I was seven, I used to think that Griffin was like a young Harlan

675
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:42,000
Williams.

676
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:45,000
Holy shit, Griffin.

677
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:48,000
Now I'm being usual suspects again.

678
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:49,000
I know.

679
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:50,000
I know.

680
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,000
Kaiser Sose 2.

681
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:53,000
Sose again.

682
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:54,000
I didn't.

683
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,000
Sose we all.

684
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:57,000
Sose we all.

685
00:32:57,000 --> 00:33:00,000
You were suspect Sose.

686
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:01,000
Oh, god.

687
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:17,000
Can we go to the money zone?

688
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:19,000
A lot of great stuff, Trav, huh?

689
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:20,000
Yeah.

690
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:21,000
Hilarious, but also makes you think.

691
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:26,000
That's the best thing about it is that it makes you think.

692
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:30,000
And what we want you to do right now is think about spending some money on our beloved sponsors.

693
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:33,000
First up this week is Boll and Branch.

694
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:35,000
That's B-O-L-L and Branch.

695
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:37,000
We've been talking about them for a long time.

696
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:41,000
They have wonderful, impossibly good sheets.

697
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:43,000
They're the only ones that I'll sleep on.

698
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:44,000
Otherwise, I won't sleep.

699
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:48,000
I'll just lay and think about how itchy and crappy my non-Boll and Branch sheets are.

700
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,000
So I don't use them.

701
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:55,000
They're 100% organic cotton sheets, which means they start out super soft and get even

702
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:56,000
softer over time.

703
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,000
Plus, they last longer.

704
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:01,000
And that's why Boll and Branch will let you sleep on them for 30 nights.

705
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:04,000
If you're not thrilled, send them back for a full refund.

706
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,000
Another idea, these make a great gift.

707
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:11,000
They come in really beautiful packaging, and I think anybody would be excited to have new,

708
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:12,000
great sheets.

709
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:13,000
They're also very strong.

710
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:17,000
If you're looking to string them together to climb out of a tall tower.

711
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:19,000
Tall tower, you can totally do that.

712
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:23,000
Or if you wanted to use them to catch people who were jumping out of second story windows

713
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:24,000
of a burning building.

714
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:25,000
Whatever.

715
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:27,000
It doesn't say that on the package.

716
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:28,000
I want to make it clear.

717
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,000
Boll and Branch is not making these claims.

718
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,000
These are Travis McElroy originals.

719
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:39,000
Right now, our listeners can order at BollandBranch.com and get $50 off a set of sheets.

720
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:41,000
That's $50.

721
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:42,000
50 clams.

722
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,000
50 clams.

723
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,000
That's BollandBranch.com.

724
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,000
Promo code MyBrother.

725
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:49,000
BollandBranch.

726
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:52,000
That's B-O-L-L and Branch.com.

727
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:56,000
Promo code MyBrother and get $50 off a set of sheets.

728
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:59,000
Is clams a thing people say in terms of money?

729
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:00,000
It is, right?

730
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:01,000
It is a thing.

731
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:02,000
Right?

732
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:03,000
Who else we got to beat, Travis?

733
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:06,000
I said it, and it didn't sound right.

734
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:07,000
Also this week, we've got Harry's.

735
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:09,000
Justin, let me ask you a question.

736
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:10,000
How's your face?

737
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:11,000
Great.

738
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:12,000
Perfect, actually.

739
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:13,000
Yeah?

740
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:14,000
Yeah, it's a perfect face.

741
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:15,000
Can you say smooth?

742
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:16,000
It's perfectly smooth.

743
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:18,000
It's a great face, but you know why?

744
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:19,000
It's perfectly smooth?

745
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:20,000
You have no facial features?

746
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:21,000
No.

747
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:23,000
It's a perfect face, and you know why?

748
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:28,000
Because I use Harry's for my shaving needs.

749
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:29,000
Yeah, you do.

750
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:30,000
Harry's.

751
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:33,000
It's just, I would say, a revolution in the world of shaving.

752
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:38,000
You might still be doing the store-bought stuff, and you're going and you're having

753
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:44,000
to wait for somebody to come unlock the acrylic bulletproof case because you're some kind

754
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:48,000
of razor criminal, but Harry's doesn't believe in all that shit.

755
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:52,000
You go to harrys.com, you just order what you need, and you know what?

756
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:56,320
Because they don't have all of that brick and mortar overhead stuff, you're going to

757
00:35:56,320 --> 00:36:00,480
get it at a way cheaper price, but with higher quality blades.

758
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:01,560
And that's the deal with Harry's.

759
00:36:01,560 --> 00:36:05,360
You get high quality blades at cheap, cheap prices.

760
00:36:05,360 --> 00:36:06,360
It's a great deal.

761
00:36:06,360 --> 00:36:12,680
And right now, Harry's has a limited edition set that would be perfect for maybe a holiday

762
00:36:12,680 --> 00:36:16,160
gift or just a little treat for yourself.

763
00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:22,280
It's called the Winter Winston Shaving Set, and it has a midnight blue chrome razor handle,

764
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:25,280
which you can get engraved with initials.

765
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:29,680
Three of Harry's German-engineered five-blade cartridges that provide a close, comfortable

766
00:36:29,680 --> 00:36:30,680
shave.

767
00:36:30,680 --> 00:36:34,560
It also has some foaming shave gel, and it comes in a beautifully designed gift box.

768
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:40,400
So this isn't just plastic bubble packaging that looks like you bought it at the corner

769
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:41,400
store.

770
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:45,520
This looks like something someone would be happy to open, be excited to get, and that's

771
00:36:45,520 --> 00:36:47,600
all for only 30 bucks.

772
00:36:47,600 --> 00:36:50,680
And razors, they're for everybody.

773
00:36:50,680 --> 00:36:51,680
Razors are for everybody.

774
00:36:51,680 --> 00:36:55,400
I use it, Teresa uses it, and BB uses it.

775
00:36:55,400 --> 00:36:57,520
We've tried to get her to stop, but she just won't.

776
00:36:57,520 --> 00:36:59,000
She's like, no, Dad, let me play with the razor.

777
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:00,560
Where does she keep finding these razors?

778
00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:02,480
Well, we don't keep a clean house.

779
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:04,200
We just leave razors laying around.

780
00:37:04,200 --> 00:37:05,200
Sure.

781
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:06,200
Listen, I know-

782
00:37:06,200 --> 00:37:08,440
At these prices, you can afford to, Trav.

783
00:37:08,440 --> 00:37:10,480
Yeah, we get them.

784
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:12,240
Half of the razors we have, we just throw on the ground.

785
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:13,920
You know what I mean?

786
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:14,920
So how can they get it?

787
00:37:14,920 --> 00:37:20,880
Well, what you're going to want to do is you're going to want to go to harrys.com and you're

788
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:26,280
going to enter the code mybrother at checkout and you'll get $5 off.

789
00:37:26,280 --> 00:37:32,000
Now this is a limited edition shave set, so they still will have their other shave sets,

790
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:37,080
but this Winter Winston shaving set won't last long.

791
00:37:37,080 --> 00:37:40,320
And free shipping ends on December 9th.

792
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:43,120
So if you're looking to get something for the holidays, you're going to want to go get

793
00:37:43,120 --> 00:37:44,120
it now.

794
00:37:44,120 --> 00:37:50,840
Go to harrys.com and enter the code mybrother, all one word, at checkout for $5 off.

795
00:37:50,840 --> 00:37:52,480
Trust me, it's amazing.

796
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:57,360
Go check out harrys.com, H-A-R-R-Y-S.com.

797
00:37:57,360 --> 00:38:02,560
I got a message for Ben, and it's from Doug, and the message is, happy birthday, bro.

798
00:38:02,560 --> 00:38:06,280
I definitely didn't buy this a week before your birthday because it was actually less

799
00:38:06,280 --> 00:38:07,280
than a week.

800
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:08,280
Yep.

801
00:38:08,280 --> 00:38:09,960
I'm best brother.

802
00:38:09,960 --> 00:38:12,260
Sorry for the disappointment a long time ago.

803
00:38:12,260 --> 00:38:16,440
Maybe it'll happen in time for my birthday, in which case, happy birthday me, probably,

804
00:38:16,440 --> 00:38:17,440
for me.

805
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:18,440
Buckle up, Doug.

806
00:38:18,440 --> 00:38:19,440
Love it.

807
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:28,000
And the time frame, it literally says this, the time frame is May 8th, lol, which I think

808
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:32,640
probably Doug knew what he was when he picked us up.

809
00:38:32,640 --> 00:38:38,480
So thank you to Doug and happy birthday, a long, long time ago, Ben.

810
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:43,600
Oh, speaking of, the Jumbotrons are on sale again.

811
00:38:43,600 --> 00:38:47,800
I haven't checked to see how far in advance they are sold out now, but they did go on

812
00:38:47,800 --> 00:38:53,520
sale today, the 28th, so don't wait.

813
00:38:53,520 --> 00:38:57,520
If you're looking for something, go do it now.

814
00:38:57,520 --> 00:38:59,120
You got another message here, Trav?

815
00:38:59,120 --> 00:39:00,800
We do.

816
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:07,760
This other message, Justin, thank you for asking, is for Wheelchair, and it's from Snake.

817
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:08,920
Happy birthday, Boo.

818
00:39:08,920 --> 00:39:10,040
I love you the most.

819
00:39:10,040 --> 00:39:11,720
I'm so glad you were born.

820
00:39:11,720 --> 00:39:15,800
Good job on another 365 days of super badassery.

821
00:39:15,800 --> 00:39:20,660
You've got the brains, the looks, the booty, and the hooks?

822
00:39:20,660 --> 00:39:21,660
Hooks for hands.

823
00:39:21,660 --> 00:39:26,800
Enjoy the brothers saying these things, butts, butts, butts, butts, butts, butts, get out

824
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:30,120
of my dreams and into my car, beep, boop, boop, beep.

825
00:39:30,120 --> 00:39:31,120
I'm a robot.

826
00:39:31,120 --> 00:39:34,200
That was a very good message.

827
00:39:34,200 --> 00:39:35,200
That was pretty solid.

828
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:36,760
I liked all of that a lot.

829
00:39:36,760 --> 00:39:42,240
That's great stuff, so happy birthday, and that was for June 25th, so again, very sorry

830
00:39:42,240 --> 00:39:43,240
about that.

831
00:39:43,240 --> 00:39:44,240
Whoops.

832
00:39:44,240 --> 00:39:45,240
Whoops-a-daisy.

833
00:39:45,240 --> 00:39:48,440
Anyway, folks, thank you for listening.

834
00:39:48,440 --> 00:39:54,100
Oh, oh, before we head back into the show, the new episode of Till Death Do Us Blart

835
00:39:54,100 --> 00:39:55,100
is up.

836
00:39:55,100 --> 00:39:56,100
Yes.

837
00:39:56,100 --> 00:39:57,100
It went up on Thanksgiving.

838
00:39:57,100 --> 00:39:58,100
In case you missed it, go check that out.

839
00:39:58,100 --> 00:40:01,600
In case you don't know who that is, me, Justin Griffin, and Tim and Guy from The Worst Idea

840
00:40:01,600 --> 00:40:05,720
of All Time watch and review Paul Blart Mall Cop 2 every American Thanksgiving for the

841
00:40:05,720 --> 00:40:07,200
rest of linear time.

842
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:08,200
Go check it out.

843
00:40:08,200 --> 00:40:10,000
Till Death Do Us Blart.

844
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,760
Anyway, back to the show.

845
00:40:12,760 --> 00:40:14,320
This one is sent in by Krista Whalen.

846
00:40:14,320 --> 00:40:15,320
Thank you, Krista.

847
00:40:15,320 --> 00:40:21,760
It's by Yahoo Answers user Kevin, who asks, if your celebrity crush says he or she will

848
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:30,360
go out with you, if you eat just a little bit of his or her poop, would you do it?

849
00:40:30,360 --> 00:40:35,320
Oh, God.

850
00:40:35,320 --> 00:40:37,760
Yes.

851
00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:40,200
Yes.

852
00:40:40,200 --> 00:40:43,080
No.

853
00:40:43,080 --> 00:40:44,640
Can you reread the question?

854
00:40:44,640 --> 00:40:48,080
If your celebrity crush says he or she will go out with you, if...

855
00:40:48,080 --> 00:40:49,080
Stop right there.

856
00:40:49,080 --> 00:40:50,080
Stop right there.

857
00:40:50,080 --> 00:40:51,080
Okay.

858
00:40:51,080 --> 00:40:52,080
Go out with you?

859
00:40:52,080 --> 00:40:53,080
Listen.

860
00:40:53,080 --> 00:40:57,920
If you're talking about an ongoing relationship with my celebrity crush, this isn't just a

861
00:40:57,920 --> 00:41:00,480
one-off situation, okay?

862
00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:05,240
Anybody who begins the tenor of the relationship with, just eat a little bit of my poop.

863
00:41:05,240 --> 00:41:06,240
So how did you guys meet?

864
00:41:06,240 --> 00:41:07,240
Well, funny story.

865
00:41:07,240 --> 00:41:08,240
How did you guys meet?

866
00:41:08,240 --> 00:41:09,240
It's a terrible...

867
00:41:09,240 --> 00:41:10,240
What if that's...

868
00:41:10,240 --> 00:41:15,240
That's how how I met your mother ends.

869
00:41:15,240 --> 00:41:28,920
The final part of the last shot of the show is the two kids on the couch horrifying.

870
00:41:28,920 --> 00:41:29,920
Yeah.

871
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:34,560
The series finale, the episode is 30 seconds long, and Bob Saget's like, all right, here

872
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:35,560
it comes.

873
00:41:35,560 --> 00:41:36,560
Are you ready?

874
00:41:36,560 --> 00:41:37,560
It's Penelope Cruz.

875
00:41:37,560 --> 00:41:39,200
And she said, how do you feel about scat?

876
00:41:39,200 --> 00:41:40,200
And I said, not great.

877
00:41:40,200 --> 00:41:41,480
And she said, well, tough.

878
00:41:41,480 --> 00:41:43,080
And then I ate just a little bit.

879
00:41:43,080 --> 00:41:44,080
The end.

880
00:41:44,080 --> 00:41:49,560
And the camera pans around and Bob Saget is wearing a ball gag and he's in chains.

881
00:41:49,560 --> 00:41:50,560
Any other questions?

882
00:41:50,560 --> 00:41:54,840
Now get out of here so your mom can poop on me.

883
00:41:54,840 --> 00:41:55,840
Oh, man.

884
00:41:55,840 --> 00:41:56,840
And that is the story.

885
00:41:56,840 --> 00:42:01,320
Now your mom says her little whore has done enough storytelling, it's time to get upstairs

886
00:42:01,320 --> 00:42:06,560
and do my whore job, like a good little slut that I am, the dad from How I Met Your Mother.

887
00:42:06,560 --> 00:42:07,560
I have to go.

888
00:42:07,560 --> 00:42:08,560
Oh, God.

889
00:42:08,560 --> 00:42:09,560
Oh, God.

890
00:42:09,560 --> 00:42:10,560
Oh, shit.

891
00:42:10,560 --> 00:42:11,560
That'd be great.

892
00:42:11,560 --> 00:42:12,560
Those kids would be so angry.

893
00:42:12,560 --> 00:42:15,160
Like, we've been sitting here for seven years.

894
00:42:15,160 --> 00:42:16,480
And that's how it ends?

895
00:42:16,480 --> 00:42:17,600
The end of it is you eating a little bit of poop?

896
00:42:17,600 --> 00:42:19,600
And he just looks and he goes, the aristocrats.

897
00:42:19,600 --> 00:42:20,600
Yeah.

898
00:42:20,600 --> 00:42:21,600
Really?

899
00:42:21,600 --> 00:42:22,600
What if...

900
00:42:22,600 --> 00:42:24,880
So you think it might be a celebrity mother?

901
00:42:24,880 --> 00:42:25,880
You think...

902
00:42:25,880 --> 00:42:30,360
And that's how I met your mother, Geena Davis.

903
00:42:30,360 --> 00:42:38,120
Known archer and scat enthusiast and star of Cutthroat Island, Geena Davis.

904
00:42:38,120 --> 00:42:44,960
Earth girls may be easy, but Earth boys will eat your poopy.

905
00:42:44,960 --> 00:42:45,960
It's science.

906
00:42:45,960 --> 00:42:51,520
I also feel like you reveal too much and letting people know that my celebrity crush is Geena

907
00:42:51,520 --> 00:42:52,520
Davis.

908
00:42:52,520 --> 00:42:53,520
Well...

909
00:42:53,520 --> 00:42:57,480
Now Geena Davis or Earth girls are easy era Geenas?

910
00:42:57,480 --> 00:42:58,480
Yeah, Commander in Chief.

911
00:42:58,480 --> 00:43:02,960
Geena, like 1988 circa Geena Davis.

912
00:43:02,960 --> 00:43:03,960
Sure.

913
00:43:03,960 --> 00:43:07,360
But also circa 1988, Annie McDowell.

914
00:43:07,360 --> 00:43:08,360
So...

915
00:43:08,360 --> 00:43:09,360
Oh my God.

916
00:43:09,360 --> 00:43:10,360
Yes.

917
00:43:10,360 --> 00:43:11,360
I got some weird standards.

918
00:43:11,360 --> 00:43:12,360
Yeah.

919
00:43:12,360 --> 00:43:13,360
And it includes time travel.

920
00:43:13,360 --> 00:43:15,560
I guess.

921
00:43:15,560 --> 00:43:16,560
And being eight.

922
00:43:16,560 --> 00:43:19,480
I don't want to talk about it.

923
00:43:19,480 --> 00:43:21,680
There isn't...

924
00:43:21,680 --> 00:43:22,680
We're not equipped to...

925
00:43:22,680 --> 00:43:27,800
We're all in very happy relationships.

926
00:43:27,800 --> 00:43:32,240
I feel like if this question was to hang out with a celebrity you think you should be best

927
00:43:32,240 --> 00:43:33,240
friends with...

928
00:43:33,240 --> 00:43:34,240
That's what I'm saying.

929
00:43:34,240 --> 00:43:35,560
Would you eat a little bit of Alton Brown's poopy?

930
00:43:35,560 --> 00:43:36,560
Just to like...

931
00:43:36,560 --> 00:43:37,560
Just to like hang out with him.

932
00:43:37,560 --> 00:43:38,560
Well, yes.

933
00:43:38,560 --> 00:43:39,560
Have you seen how well he eats?

934
00:43:39,560 --> 00:43:40,560
Yeah.

935
00:43:40,560 --> 00:43:41,560
He would prepare it.

936
00:43:41,560 --> 00:43:42,560
I think...

937
00:43:42,560 --> 00:43:43,560
He got way healthy.

938
00:43:43,560 --> 00:43:44,560
Yeah.

939
00:43:44,560 --> 00:43:47,340
I was saying, like, if you said, like, eat a little bit of David Tennant's poop, all

940
00:43:47,340 --> 00:43:48,340
over it.

941
00:43:48,340 --> 00:43:49,340
Yeah, sure.

942
00:43:49,340 --> 00:43:50,340
Can we not have this conversation at all?

943
00:43:50,340 --> 00:43:53,200
Travis would probably eat a little bit of David Tennant's poop, even if it meant not

944
00:43:53,200 --> 00:43:54,200
hanging.

945
00:43:54,200 --> 00:43:55,200
Just cause.

946
00:43:55,200 --> 00:43:56,200
Just cause.

947
00:43:56,200 --> 00:44:00,600
Even if I just ran into a dude on the street in London who said, hey, you want a bit of

948
00:44:00,600 --> 00:44:01,880
David Tennant's poop?

949
00:44:01,880 --> 00:44:03,640
I would ask the price.

950
00:44:03,640 --> 00:44:04,800
Can this not happen?

951
00:44:04,800 --> 00:44:05,800
Let me just ask...

952
00:44:05,800 --> 00:44:06,800
Listen, I only...

953
00:44:06,800 --> 00:44:10,800
Listen, I know you want to get off this subject, but I have like 75 more questions.

954
00:44:10,800 --> 00:44:12,200
Do you think there are people out there...

955
00:44:12,200 --> 00:44:13,200
And I really...

956
00:44:13,200 --> 00:44:17,440
I don't fancy myself a celebrity, but do you think there are people out there who eat

957
00:44:17,440 --> 00:44:20,640
a little bit of our poop just to hang out with us?

958
00:44:20,640 --> 00:44:23,440
Yeah.

959
00:44:23,440 --> 00:44:25,080
I really hope not.

960
00:44:25,080 --> 00:44:28,280
Like I super, super, super hope not.

961
00:44:28,280 --> 00:44:29,680
Okay, let me rephrase.

962
00:44:29,680 --> 00:44:31,960
I bet there are people out there that would just eat our poop.

963
00:44:31,960 --> 00:44:32,960
I don't think...

964
00:44:32,960 --> 00:44:33,960
No, Travis.

965
00:44:33,960 --> 00:44:34,960
No, we're not.

966
00:44:34,960 --> 00:44:35,960
No, we're not.

967
00:44:35,960 --> 00:44:38,080
We're not Tennant level, but I think we have a little bit...

968
00:44:38,080 --> 00:44:39,080
No, no, no.

969
00:44:39,080 --> 00:44:41,360
I'm saying just because I think there are people out there that like to eat poop.

970
00:44:41,360 --> 00:44:42,360
Oh, sure.

971
00:44:42,360 --> 00:44:43,360
Sure.

972
00:44:43,360 --> 00:44:44,360
Okay.

973
00:44:44,360 --> 00:44:46,840
Guys, everything that's happening right now is the worst thing that's ever happened to

974
00:44:46,840 --> 00:44:47,840
me.

975
00:44:47,840 --> 00:44:48,840
Okay.

976
00:44:48,840 --> 00:44:51,760
Justin, there's not a single celebrity whose poop you would eat to hang out with them?

977
00:44:51,760 --> 00:44:54,480
There's not a single person whose poop...

978
00:44:54,480 --> 00:44:55,480
Antonio Banderas.

979
00:44:55,480 --> 00:44:56,480
Okay.

980
00:44:56,480 --> 00:44:57,480
You got me.

981
00:44:57,480 --> 00:44:58,480
Shit.

982
00:44:58,480 --> 00:45:04,040
You got to cut to the core of me, Travis.

983
00:45:04,040 --> 00:45:05,040
Let's see.

984
00:45:05,040 --> 00:45:06,040
Yeah, let's...

985
00:45:06,040 --> 00:45:07,160
I need to talk about something like humans talk about.

986
00:45:07,160 --> 00:45:09,800
I need to take like a big gulp of water and just...

987
00:45:09,800 --> 00:45:10,800
Ugh.

988
00:45:10,800 --> 00:45:11,800
Ugh.

989
00:45:11,800 --> 00:45:12,800
It's not a big gulp.

990
00:45:12,800 --> 00:45:15,320
I hate this stupid podcast.

991
00:45:15,320 --> 00:45:17,360
I recently started a new job and I got a problem.

992
00:45:17,360 --> 00:45:21,440
My manager burps constantly, never excuses himself.

993
00:45:21,440 --> 00:45:25,720
He mentioned once that he burps when he is hungry, but that wouldn't mean he's hungry

994
00:45:25,720 --> 00:45:26,720
all the time.

995
00:45:26,720 --> 00:45:29,200
The other day, your boss is Yogi Bear.

996
00:45:29,200 --> 00:45:33,400
The other day, I think he burped in front of a customer and didn't say anything.

997
00:45:33,400 --> 00:45:35,840
Also, these are not little burps.

998
00:45:35,840 --> 00:45:36,840
Should I say something to him?

999
00:45:36,840 --> 00:45:38,640
If so, what should I say?

1000
00:45:38,640 --> 00:45:42,640
Is this just a guy trying the...

1001
00:45:42,640 --> 00:45:46,200
Is this just a guy thing that girls just have to deal with?

1002
00:45:46,200 --> 00:45:50,680
I was bullied by a burper in elementary school, so maybe I'm more sensitive to burps.

1003
00:45:50,680 --> 00:45:52,040
Please help me out.

1004
00:45:52,040 --> 00:45:54,600
Grossed out in Greenwich, who worked for Travis.

1005
00:45:54,600 --> 00:45:55,600
Pretty sure it's Greenwich.

1006
00:45:55,600 --> 00:45:56,600
No.

1007
00:45:56,600 --> 00:45:57,600
Greenwich.

1008
00:45:57,600 --> 00:45:58,600
I don't know why I said Greenwich.

1009
00:45:58,600 --> 00:46:00,040
I'm so sorry.

1010
00:46:00,040 --> 00:46:02,040
You edited that, so I said it.

1011
00:46:02,040 --> 00:46:03,040
Okay.

1012
00:46:03,040 --> 00:46:04,040
Oh, a dog.

1013
00:46:04,040 --> 00:46:05,040
Egg.

1014
00:46:05,040 --> 00:46:06,040
Burps are completely natural.

1015
00:46:06,040 --> 00:46:07,040
Travis burps.

1016
00:46:07,040 --> 00:46:08,040
This gentleman needs to learn to excuse himself.

1017
00:46:08,040 --> 00:46:09,040
Travis burps.

1018
00:46:09,040 --> 00:46:10,040
Did you say egg burps are natural?

1019
00:46:10,040 --> 00:46:19,640
Because I'm here to tell you, egg burps are the pits if they are the most unnatural thing.

1020
00:46:19,640 --> 00:46:20,960
I said the letter A.

1021
00:46:20,960 --> 00:46:21,960
Okay.

1022
00:46:21,960 --> 00:46:24,120
It sounded like egg, so are you hungry right now?

1023
00:46:24,120 --> 00:46:25,200
Is that a burp?

1024
00:46:25,200 --> 00:46:26,480
I actually am very hungry.

1025
00:46:26,480 --> 00:46:27,760
I have not eaten all day.

1026
00:46:27,760 --> 00:46:31,400
The first time God smelled an egg burp, he was like, I did not make that.

1027
00:46:31,400 --> 00:46:32,400
That one's on me.

1028
00:46:32,400 --> 00:46:33,400
I blew it.

1029
00:46:33,400 --> 00:46:34,400
I blew it.

1030
00:46:34,400 --> 00:46:35,400
This is not of my creation.

1031
00:46:35,400 --> 00:46:36,400
That one's on Satan.

1032
00:46:36,400 --> 00:46:38,120
That was a Satan burp.

1033
00:46:38,120 --> 00:46:40,560
I have not eaten in the last three days to avoid burping.

1034
00:46:40,560 --> 00:46:41,560
I'm trying to cut back.

1035
00:46:41,560 --> 00:46:42,560
I appreciate that.

1036
00:46:42,560 --> 00:46:43,560
No, Travis burps a lot.

1037
00:46:43,560 --> 00:46:44,560
I'm very lonely.

1038
00:46:44,560 --> 00:46:45,560
Travis has the dyspepsia.

1039
00:46:45,560 --> 00:46:46,560
I have a disease.

1040
00:46:46,560 --> 00:46:47,560
You have a disease.

1041
00:46:47,560 --> 00:46:50,240
He tries to blame it on a disease, but it's really just rude.

1042
00:46:50,240 --> 00:46:51,240
I don't know.

1043
00:46:51,240 --> 00:46:52,240
It's not rude.

1044
00:46:52,240 --> 00:46:56,520
The disease doesn't make you open your fucking mouth when you burp like you do.

1045
00:46:56,520 --> 00:46:58,640
If I don't burp, I'll vomit.

1046
00:46:58,640 --> 00:46:59,640
You close your-

1047
00:46:59,640 --> 00:47:04,040
The disease doesn't make you go to the trophy store and buy one every time.

1048
00:47:04,040 --> 00:47:05,040
I'm just saying.

1049
00:47:05,040 --> 00:47:08,560
I had one once that was like three minutes long and sounded like a demon was coming out

1050
00:47:08,560 --> 00:47:09,560
of me and it was epic.

1051
00:47:09,560 --> 00:47:10,560
That's fine, but-

1052
00:47:10,560 --> 00:47:12,840
How does the disease prevent you from covering your goddamn mouth every time?

1053
00:47:12,840 --> 00:47:13,840
Or not buying a t-shirt.

1054
00:47:13,840 --> 00:47:14,840
Because I'm not a child.

1055
00:47:14,840 --> 00:47:17,520
I'll burp when I want to in my own goddamn house.

1056
00:47:17,520 --> 00:47:19,760
But you're often not in your house.

1057
00:47:19,760 --> 00:47:20,960
I'll burp in your house.

1058
00:47:20,960 --> 00:47:22,640
I'll burp in anyone's house.

1059
00:47:22,640 --> 00:47:25,240
I would not, could not in a house.

1060
00:47:25,240 --> 00:47:32,320
One time I actually heard Travis burp out the words Cincinnati King of Burps, which-

1061
00:47:32,320 --> 00:47:38,920
To be fair, that was during a job interview and I nailed it.

1062
00:47:38,920 --> 00:47:44,320
And now I'm this person's boss, so I'm climbing up the ladder.

1063
00:47:44,320 --> 00:47:46,760
I'm afraid I might have it.

1064
00:47:46,760 --> 00:47:51,360
This past year I've been burping a lot and it's really not from a place of pride like

1065
00:47:51,360 --> 00:47:52,360
Travis.

1066
00:47:52,360 --> 00:47:53,360
I'm deeply ashamed every time I do it.

1067
00:47:53,360 --> 00:47:57,320
And I live with my girlfriend now, so she has to like, I always try to be dainty about

1068
00:47:57,320 --> 00:47:58,320
it.

1069
00:47:58,320 --> 00:47:59,320
So that's a sin trying to come out.

1070
00:47:59,320 --> 00:48:04,880
I try to be dainty about it, but there's just nothing doing and I always feel this need

1071
00:48:04,880 --> 00:48:07,000
to just apologize profusely every time it happens.

1072
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:10,320
You should just hide it behind a lace fan.

1073
00:48:10,320 --> 00:48:15,320
Put your gloved hand to the back of your hand, to your mouth, and hide it.

1074
00:48:15,320 --> 00:48:17,800
Because apparently you're a Victorian person.

1075
00:48:17,800 --> 00:48:19,160
Just burp like an American.

1076
00:48:19,160 --> 00:48:23,240
I faint every time too, which is nice.

1077
00:48:23,240 --> 00:48:24,240
That's the vapors.

1078
00:48:24,240 --> 00:48:25,240
No, it's horrible.

1079
00:48:25,240 --> 00:48:26,240
It's disgusting.

1080
00:48:26,240 --> 00:48:30,680
You're farting with your mouth and you wouldn't-

1081
00:48:30,680 --> 00:48:36,200
In all seriousness, you should not, this dude is wrong, burping at a professional workplace

1082
00:48:36,200 --> 00:48:38,240
in front of customers as your boss.

1083
00:48:38,240 --> 00:48:43,200
Don't get me wrong, I celebrate my burps at home with friends where it's safe.

1084
00:48:43,200 --> 00:48:45,160
It's not, but go on.

1085
00:48:45,160 --> 00:48:46,160
That's what I'm saying.

1086
00:48:46,160 --> 00:48:51,360
I think that you're perfectly in the right to the next time he does it be like, hey Chet,

1087
00:48:51,360 --> 00:48:52,360
cut it out.

1088
00:48:52,360 --> 00:48:56,780
You realize that when I'm staying over at your house on a trip or something like that

1089
00:48:56,780 --> 00:49:02,920
and you burp, the first thing I don't think is, oh, this is a really safe environment

1090
00:49:02,920 --> 00:49:06,220
for me to be in.

1091
00:49:06,220 --> 00:49:08,640
You don't think, well, I'm a guest in his house.

1092
00:49:08,640 --> 00:49:11,720
No, I think, are you fucking kidding me?

1093
00:49:11,720 --> 00:49:15,680
I'm holding a burp right now, you guys, because I love you and I love our listeners.

1094
00:49:15,680 --> 00:49:21,580
When I know Griffin's coming to my house, I turn on a nice scentsy, I'll maybe select

1095
00:49:21,580 --> 00:49:25,800
a scent cake to put in, something I know he'll enjoy.

1096
00:49:25,800 --> 00:49:30,040
When Griffin goes to Travis's house, Travis just burps in his face and shouts, dominance.

1097
00:49:30,040 --> 00:49:33,720
Listen, I will not be bullied, all right?

1098
00:49:33,720 --> 00:49:35,560
Burpers unite, stand up.

1099
00:49:35,560 --> 00:49:39,720
I think it's an old fashioned, you might as well be telling me about how you're going

1100
00:49:39,720 --> 00:49:46,000
to get a phosphate down the soda fountain and then pin a girl and go steady.

1101
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:51,960
We're adults, it's 2012, burp if you want to, you shouldn't be offended.

1102
00:49:51,960 --> 00:49:55,080
It's an archaic rule, manners while you're out.

1103
00:49:55,080 --> 00:49:56,260
How does it upset anyone?

1104
00:49:56,260 --> 00:50:00,120
You burp so hard once my beer fell over.

1105
00:50:00,120 --> 00:50:04,760
How does it affect anyone other than being children and giggling at it because it's burping?

1106
00:50:04,760 --> 00:50:08,840
Because it smells like all the food you've eaten.

1107
00:50:08,840 --> 00:50:11,040
Burp loud, burp proud.

1108
00:50:11,040 --> 00:50:12,640
How far do you extend this?

1109
00:50:12,640 --> 00:50:15,760
Like do you shit in your hands and throw it at people?

1110
00:50:15,760 --> 00:50:16,760
No, of course not.

1111
00:50:16,760 --> 00:50:19,040
Gobble that up, pretend I'm Geena Davis.

1112
00:50:19,040 --> 00:50:20,040
What are you?

1113
00:50:20,040 --> 00:50:22,960
No, because I also don't burp in people's faces.

1114
00:50:22,960 --> 00:50:25,960
I don't sneak up behind them while they're napping and burping their ears as loud as

1115
00:50:25,960 --> 00:50:26,960
I can.

1116
00:50:26,960 --> 00:50:28,200
So that would be hilarious.

1117
00:50:28,200 --> 00:50:33,020
You would excuse yourself to the corner to defecate in, like some sort of beast.

1118
00:50:33,020 --> 00:50:34,760
Is that what you're saying to me?

1119
00:50:34,760 --> 00:50:36,640
Listen, one step at a time.

1120
00:50:36,640 --> 00:50:41,640
Travis, some of us are trying to live in a society, and I'm trying to make this society

1121
00:50:41,640 --> 00:50:45,000
safer with people with my disease.

1122
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:51,400
You're saying, you're saying when you make it sound like you're throwing up invisible

1123
00:50:51,400 --> 00:50:56,960
vomit, it's because it's for a fucking cause?

1124
00:50:56,960 --> 00:50:59,120
You're making a point?

1125
00:50:59,120 --> 00:51:02,160
Well no, it's because I enjoy burping.

1126
00:51:02,160 --> 00:51:07,080
This is on the March of Grimes.

1127
00:51:07,080 --> 00:51:11,800
Oh man.

1128
00:51:11,800 --> 00:51:12,800
You are horrible.

1129
00:51:12,800 --> 00:51:13,800
Eat better.

1130
00:51:13,800 --> 00:51:14,800
Just eat better.

1131
00:51:14,800 --> 00:51:15,800
Just treat yourself better.

1132
00:51:15,800 --> 00:51:16,800
Please be focused.

1133
00:51:16,800 --> 00:51:17,800
Me?

1134
00:51:17,800 --> 00:51:18,800
Yeah.

1135
00:51:18,800 --> 00:51:19,800
Okay.

1136
00:51:19,800 --> 00:51:27,320
My lady friend's sister got knocked up by a questionable suitor from your hometown.

1137
00:51:27,320 --> 00:51:28,520
That's Huntington, West Virginia.

1138
00:51:28,520 --> 00:51:33,200
You're headed to the wedding next month and seek your guidance for things to do in Huntington

1139
00:51:33,200 --> 00:51:37,640
that don't involve feigning confidence in the unholiest of unions.

1140
00:51:37,640 --> 00:51:41,240
That's from Andy and Kindle.

1141
00:51:41,240 --> 00:51:44,000
I think the better question is what can't you do?

1142
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:45,000
Yeah.

1143
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:47,600
We've prepared a musical number for just this situation.

1144
00:51:47,600 --> 00:51:48,600
Here we go.

1145
00:51:48,600 --> 00:51:49,600
You ready?

1146
00:51:49,600 --> 00:51:50,600
Get drunk.

1147
00:51:50,600 --> 00:51:54,320
Griffin is correct.

1148
00:51:54,320 --> 00:51:57,740
There are quite a few drinking establishments in Huntington.

1149
00:51:57,740 --> 00:51:59,840
Just to name a few.

1150
00:51:59,840 --> 00:52:03,520
You got our favorite Stumblers 2 still stumbling.

1151
00:52:03,520 --> 00:52:04,520
Real bar.

1152
00:52:04,520 --> 00:52:05,520
Google it.

1153
00:52:05,520 --> 00:52:06,520
There's Peckers.

1154
00:52:06,520 --> 00:52:07,920
Is Peckers still around?

1155
00:52:07,920 --> 00:52:10,320
No, Peckers is now a teen nightclub.

1156
00:52:10,320 --> 00:52:11,320
Is it?

1157
00:52:11,320 --> 00:52:12,320
What?

1158
00:52:12,320 --> 00:52:13,320
It is.

1159
00:52:13,320 --> 00:52:14,320
It is.

1160
00:52:14,320 --> 00:52:15,880
This is the God's honest truth.

1161
00:52:15,880 --> 00:52:18,520
It was a Christian themed nightclub, right?

1162
00:52:18,520 --> 00:52:19,520
Called like Lamb of...

1163
00:52:19,520 --> 00:52:21,160
Oh fuck, what was it called?

1164
00:52:21,160 --> 00:52:22,160
David?

1165
00:52:22,160 --> 00:52:23,160
No, Lamb of Babylon?

1166
00:52:23,160 --> 00:52:24,160
No.

1167
00:52:24,160 --> 00:52:25,160
Lamb of Fun?

1168
00:52:25,160 --> 00:52:26,160
Fuck.

1169
00:52:26,160 --> 00:52:28,280
It was called the Babylon City of Sin.

1170
00:52:28,280 --> 00:52:29,280
That still exists.

1171
00:52:29,280 --> 00:52:34,680
Which was an adjunct of the Pearl Ultra Lounge.

1172
00:52:34,680 --> 00:52:37,040
Those were both in the same building, but two different names.

1173
00:52:37,040 --> 00:52:39,160
And that was the former Renaissance bookstore.

1174
00:52:39,160 --> 00:52:43,440
Former Renaissance bookstore and for a short time jazz club.

1175
00:52:43,440 --> 00:52:49,680
You got the Thirsty Whale, which you... and the off the shoulder gentlemen's club.

1176
00:52:49,680 --> 00:52:50,680
Of course.

1177
00:52:50,680 --> 00:52:52,680
You could go to Hank's.

1178
00:52:52,680 --> 00:52:54,840
Hank's, Mark's, Dave's.

1179
00:52:54,840 --> 00:52:56,640
St. Mark's place.

1180
00:52:56,640 --> 00:53:01,960
I've recently been informed by Google that there's a place called Jackhammer's on Route

1181
00:53:01,960 --> 00:53:02,960
60.

1182
00:53:02,960 --> 00:53:03,960
So make sure you get out there.

1183
00:53:03,960 --> 00:53:09,200
You go to Driftwood or Stonewall, Huntington's Two Gay Bars.

1184
00:53:09,200 --> 00:53:10,200
Jackhammer's maybe a third of...

1185
00:53:10,200 --> 00:53:13,560
For Huntington's Two Gay People.

1186
00:53:13,560 --> 00:53:14,560
It's a perfect fit.

1187
00:53:14,560 --> 00:53:17,400
They each have all the space they could want.

1188
00:53:17,400 --> 00:53:18,800
No, they're populous.

1189
00:53:18,800 --> 00:53:19,800
What else?

1190
00:53:19,800 --> 00:53:20,800
You get Hyphy.

1191
00:53:20,800 --> 00:53:23,200
You get Hillbilly Hot Dogs.

1192
00:53:23,200 --> 00:53:25,760
Get yourself a Snuffy Doll with cheese or...

1193
00:53:25,760 --> 00:53:29,360
Huntington Prime if you're looking for something a little fancier.

1194
00:53:29,360 --> 00:53:33,200
You could go stare in the windows of the closed down theater.

1195
00:53:33,200 --> 00:53:34,200
Which one you ask?

1196
00:53:34,200 --> 00:53:35,200
Ah, take your pick.

1197
00:53:35,200 --> 00:53:36,800
Take your pick.

1198
00:53:36,800 --> 00:53:40,760
You could visit the burial place of Soupy Sales.

1199
00:53:40,760 --> 00:53:41,760
Is he dead?

1200
00:53:41,760 --> 00:53:43,280
Is he dead?

1201
00:53:43,280 --> 00:53:44,280
He is dead.

1202
00:53:44,280 --> 00:53:47,160
You could go stare at the river for hours.

1203
00:53:47,160 --> 00:53:50,320
Also you're on a lot of meth at the time.

1204
00:53:50,320 --> 00:53:51,320
You could buy meth.

1205
00:53:51,320 --> 00:53:52,320
You could make meth.

1206
00:53:52,320 --> 00:53:53,320
Yeah, sure.

1207
00:53:53,320 --> 00:53:54,320
You can fight the urge.

1208
00:53:54,320 --> 00:53:55,320
You should jump in that river.

1209
00:53:55,320 --> 00:53:56,320
And just...

1210
00:53:56,320 --> 00:53:57,320
Because you'll die.

1211
00:53:57,320 --> 00:53:58,320
Just let it take you.

1212
00:53:58,320 --> 00:53:59,320
Yeah.

1213
00:53:59,320 --> 00:54:00,320
Let it take you down.

1214
00:54:00,320 --> 00:54:04,320
And I think those are all the things.

1215
00:54:04,320 --> 00:54:05,320
So...

1216
00:54:05,320 --> 00:54:06,320
Enjoy.

1217
00:54:06,320 --> 00:54:07,320
Have a great trip.

1218
00:54:07,320 --> 00:54:08,800
Make sure to look me up.

1219
00:54:08,800 --> 00:54:10,960
There are tours by my home.

1220
00:54:10,960 --> 00:54:11,960
Ghost tours.

1221
00:54:11,960 --> 00:54:14,800
Ghost tours by my home three times daily.

1222
00:54:14,800 --> 00:54:17,000
Justlin's near a hospital.

1223
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:19,600
So a lot of spectral activity up there.

1224
00:54:19,600 --> 00:54:20,600
Yeah.

1225
00:54:20,600 --> 00:54:24,720
I took you on a ghost tour of some of Huntington's number one most haunted places.

1226
00:54:24,720 --> 00:54:28,000
Did I ever tell you guys that story?

1227
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:36,920
I took a ghost tour in Savannah where you go around the local locations.

1228
00:54:36,920 --> 00:54:41,720
And really it's just an excuse to stop by local bars and you drive around in a giant

1229
00:54:41,720 --> 00:54:45,400
hearse and you stop at local bars and you get out and you buy some...

1230
00:54:45,400 --> 00:54:49,600
Even if they're not haunted or supposedly haunted, you can still buy alcohol because

1231
00:54:49,600 --> 00:54:51,600
Savannah has open containers.

1232
00:54:51,600 --> 00:54:53,600
And you get all the spirits.

1233
00:54:53,600 --> 00:54:54,960
Get all the spirits you want, right?

1234
00:54:54,960 --> 00:54:57,800
So you can get to travel and travel around.

1235
00:54:57,800 --> 00:55:08,540
And at one of these breaks, at one of these beer breaks, the driver is talking to my father-in-law

1236
00:55:08,540 --> 00:55:09,540
and he said, where are you guys from?

1237
00:55:09,540 --> 00:55:12,760
And we said, West Virginia.

1238
00:55:12,760 --> 00:55:20,240
And he said, yeah, there's a prison there in West Virginia that is supposedly haunted,

1239
00:55:20,240 --> 00:55:21,240
right?

1240
00:55:21,240 --> 00:55:29,040
And my father-in-law Tommy says, yeah, apparently it's one of the most haunted places in America.

1241
00:55:29,040 --> 00:55:37,280
And the guy, I shit you not, says, well, most haunted is difficult to quantify.

1242
00:55:37,280 --> 00:55:38,280
Is it?

1243
00:55:38,280 --> 00:55:39,280
Is it, sir?

1244
00:55:39,280 --> 00:55:40,280
Is it difficult?

1245
00:55:40,280 --> 00:55:45,640
If a place, if a place had a ghost in it, it would become the most haunted place in

1246
00:55:45,640 --> 00:55:46,640
the world.

1247
00:55:46,640 --> 00:55:47,640
Yeah.

1248
00:55:47,640 --> 00:55:52,680
One, one very like bold ghost that was just like, I'm here.

1249
00:55:52,680 --> 00:55:54,640
They stop by anytime.

1250
00:55:54,640 --> 00:55:56,120
They will trot that out though.

1251
00:55:56,120 --> 00:55:57,120
Oh yeah.

1252
00:55:57,120 --> 00:55:58,120
This is the most haunted.

1253
00:55:58,120 --> 00:55:59,120
This is the most haunted.

1254
00:55:59,120 --> 00:56:00,600
Per square foot.

1255
00:56:00,600 --> 00:56:02,360
We got a thousand ghosts a foot.

1256
00:56:02,360 --> 00:56:03,360
Yeah.

1257
00:56:03,360 --> 00:56:05,920
They're all real crammed in like sardines.

1258
00:56:05,920 --> 00:56:07,960
Can't walk from one end to the other without hitting the ghost.

1259
00:56:07,960 --> 00:56:08,960
It's really tricky to...

1260
00:56:08,960 --> 00:56:13,320
Sorry, got a little ghost, got a little ghost in my throat.

1261
00:56:13,320 --> 00:56:14,320
Sorry.

1262
00:56:14,320 --> 00:56:15,320
Sucked up some ghosts.

1263
00:56:15,320 --> 00:56:16,320
Sucked up some ghosts.

1264
00:56:16,320 --> 00:56:19,640
Oh, I'm going to have some real bad Rio tomorrow, but that's tomorrow's problem.

1265
00:56:19,640 --> 00:56:21,560
Happy birthday, Jordan.

1266
00:56:21,560 --> 00:56:23,360
Happy birthday.

1267
00:56:23,360 --> 00:56:24,360
Happy birthday, Jphonic.

1268
00:56:24,360 --> 00:56:27,240
Oh, are we not allowed to unmask?

1269
00:56:27,240 --> 00:56:28,240
Did I just like unmask the luchador?

1270
00:56:28,240 --> 00:56:29,240
He just like unmasked him, yeah.

1271
00:56:29,240 --> 00:56:30,240
Shit.

1272
00:56:30,240 --> 00:56:31,240
Go to jphonicmixtape.com.

1273
00:56:31,240 --> 00:56:36,480
You might as well tell everyone that Deadmau5's real name is Francis.

1274
00:56:36,480 --> 00:56:37,480
Oh, shit.

1275
00:56:37,480 --> 00:56:41,000
Francis, what are you doing on that stage?

1276
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:45,280
Ma, I'm trying to make some beats.

1277
00:56:45,280 --> 00:56:46,280
That's not music.

1278
00:56:46,280 --> 00:56:47,280
I...

1279
00:56:47,280 --> 00:56:48,840
Whatever happened to Rudy Vallee?

1280
00:56:48,840 --> 00:56:52,160
Ma, go home.

1281
00:56:52,160 --> 00:56:55,640
You look like a big old cyborg Mickey Mouse or something up there.

1282
00:56:55,640 --> 00:56:56,640
What are you doing?

1283
00:56:56,640 --> 00:57:01,240
Ma, I told you I'm working.

1284
00:57:01,240 --> 00:57:02,240
That ain't a job.

1285
00:57:02,240 --> 00:57:06,560
Get back to the diner and help your father clean up the hamburger slop.

1286
00:57:06,560 --> 00:57:09,960
He's not well and we're all waiting for the drop.

1287
00:57:09,960 --> 00:57:10,960
Give it to us.

1288
00:57:10,960 --> 00:57:11,960
Give us that high beat.

1289
00:57:11,960 --> 00:57:12,960
That stinky drop.

1290
00:57:12,960 --> 00:57:13,960
Give us that fat, nasty bass.

1291
00:57:13,960 --> 00:57:14,960
We're all waiting for it.

1292
00:57:14,960 --> 00:57:15,960
We all got...

1293
00:57:15,960 --> 00:57:23,760
Your grandpa's gonna die before you drop that fat bass on us.

1294
00:57:23,760 --> 00:57:33,840
Your cousin Skrillex would never make us wait this long for a fat, nasty drop.

1295
00:57:33,840 --> 00:57:39,920
Oh, Jesus.

1296
00:57:39,920 --> 00:57:48,920
Francis, my high is peaking.

1297
00:57:48,920 --> 00:57:49,920
I'm about to come down.

1298
00:57:49,920 --> 00:57:50,920
I got my hands in the air.

1299
00:57:50,920 --> 00:57:51,920
I'm ready.

1300
00:57:51,920 --> 00:57:52,920
Drop it.

1301
00:57:52,920 --> 00:57:53,920
Oh, God.

1302
00:57:53,920 --> 00:58:03,560
Your father worked all day to synthesize this X.

1303
00:58:03,560 --> 00:58:09,640
My neon globe bracelets are losing the luminosity, Francis.

1304
00:58:09,640 --> 00:58:16,720
Francis, they're closing the JCC at 7 p.m.

1305
00:58:16,720 --> 00:58:20,160
All these people have to get out, just drop it.

1306
00:58:20,160 --> 00:58:26,880
Drop the beat.

1307
00:58:26,880 --> 00:58:31,520
Can we, every time we do an episode, can we say one nice thing about each other?

1308
00:58:31,520 --> 00:58:32,520
Just something sweet.

1309
00:58:32,520 --> 00:58:38,440
Your ceviche is the best ceviche I've had, and Travis, the muscles in your hands are

1310
00:58:38,440 --> 00:58:40,320
like really big.

1311
00:58:40,320 --> 00:58:41,320
Thank you.

1312
00:58:41,320 --> 00:58:42,840
I never made ceviche for you.

1313
00:58:42,840 --> 00:58:44,520
I don't know why you would say things like that.

1314
00:58:44,520 --> 00:58:45,840
You have made ceviche for me before.

1315
00:58:45,840 --> 00:58:46,840
It's really good.

1316
00:58:46,840 --> 00:58:47,840
I have not.

1317
00:58:47,840 --> 00:58:48,840
I have not made ceviche for you before.

1318
00:58:48,840 --> 00:58:49,840
You made me ceviche shrimp once.

1319
00:58:49,840 --> 00:58:52,640
I did not make you ceviche shrimp once, but thank you.

1320
00:58:52,640 --> 00:58:53,640
You made...

1321
00:58:53,640 --> 00:58:54,640
I fucking ate ceviche.

1322
00:58:54,640 --> 00:58:55,640
If they...

1323
00:58:55,640 --> 00:58:58,480
Were those just raw shrimp I was eating out of your refrigerator?

1324
00:58:58,480 --> 00:59:01,440
Did I tell you guys about the text that I got from dad?

1325
00:59:01,440 --> 00:59:04,720
I got a text from dad, this was like three weeks ago.

1326
00:59:04,720 --> 00:59:12,480
It was maybe 8 p.m. on a Saturday night, and I get a text from our shared dad that says,

1327
00:59:12,480 --> 00:59:13,480
try ceviche.

1328
00:59:13,480 --> 00:59:23,800
Just apropos of nothing, Clint's just like, hey, try ceviche, all right, dad?

1329
00:59:23,800 --> 00:59:24,800
Like now?

1330
00:59:24,800 --> 00:59:25,800
I was thinking of putting it off.

1331
00:59:25,800 --> 00:59:26,800
I was thinking of putting it off.

1332
00:59:26,800 --> 00:59:27,800
This has gone far enough.

1333
00:59:27,800 --> 00:59:28,800
Try ceviche.

1334
00:59:28,800 --> 00:59:34,120
Do you think our dad, do you think he confused like his text message app and his notes app?

1335
00:59:34,120 --> 00:59:39,000
He's like, I gotta send this, gonna forget this, gotta put it in the cloud.

1336
00:59:39,000 --> 00:59:41,160
Oh fuck.

1337
00:59:41,160 --> 00:59:42,160
That's good.

1338
00:59:42,160 --> 00:59:45,120
Oh man, I'm...

1339
00:59:45,120 --> 00:59:51,000
Just so you guys know, of course our listening audience won't be able to enjoy this, but

1340
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:52,720
just so you guys know, I'm not fucking with you.

1341
00:59:52,720 --> 00:59:58,600
I'm gonna send you a screen cap that I just took.

1342
00:59:58,600 --> 01:00:02,280
Here are the things that my dad texted me about.

1343
01:00:02,280 --> 01:00:06,440
One, premiere dates for shows that we both enjoy.

1344
01:00:06,440 --> 01:00:09,200
This can be helpful sometimes, so I appreciate that.

1345
01:00:09,200 --> 01:00:12,440
Two, and I don't know if you guys get these too, I don't know if you guys are on this

1346
01:00:12,440 --> 01:00:18,680
mailing list, but when somebody dies, like a celebrity dies, I always get a text message

1347
01:00:18,680 --> 01:00:19,680
from dad.

1348
01:00:19,680 --> 01:00:23,920
And it's always very, it's nice that he's almost the emotional pace car for these kinds

1349
01:00:23,920 --> 01:00:29,320
of things, because he lets you know that...

1350
01:00:29,320 --> 01:00:34,200
He lets you know that yes, this person did just die, but it's cool to drop a goof in

1351
01:00:34,200 --> 01:00:35,200
here.

1352
01:00:35,200 --> 01:00:40,440
For instance, August 20th, 2012, and somewhere Fang is crying, what was that?

1353
01:00:40,440 --> 01:00:47,820
That was a reference to I think Carol Channing dying, maybe, Phyllis Diller dying.

1354
01:00:47,820 --> 01:00:52,280
It was a reference to Carol Channing killing Phyllis Diller.

1355
01:00:52,280 --> 01:00:54,680
Explain to me about hashtags on Twitter.

1356
01:00:54,680 --> 01:01:01,920
Oh, how about this, oh this is a classic Jim, he's moving on up.

1357
01:01:01,920 --> 01:01:03,640
That was when Mr. Jefferson died.

1358
01:01:03,640 --> 01:01:04,640
Priceless.

1359
01:01:04,640 --> 01:01:05,640
Priceless.

1360
01:01:05,640 --> 01:01:06,640
Priceless.

1361
01:01:06,640 --> 01:01:07,720
So good.

1362
01:01:07,720 --> 01:01:09,720
Dad doesn't text me.

1363
01:01:09,720 --> 01:01:15,480
Must be lovely to have that kind of close relationship with your father.

1364
01:01:15,480 --> 01:01:18,280
Actually I got a text about that, so I'm not texting Travis anymore.

1365
01:01:18,280 --> 01:01:22,200
He just keeps texting me and calling me Travis Snow, and I don't know why.

1366
01:01:22,200 --> 01:01:27,560
July 3rd, 2012, I hope Aunt B had him a big old pie waiting, that's when Andy Griffith

1367
01:01:27,560 --> 01:01:28,560
died.

1368
01:01:28,560 --> 01:01:29,560
Thanks dad.

1369
01:01:29,560 --> 01:01:33,680
I got this one on August 10th, big thumbs up on new pizza place.

1370
01:01:33,680 --> 01:01:34,880
That's not somebody dying.

1371
01:01:34,880 --> 01:01:39,440
No, but it was really random, because we had not spoken about a pizza place prior to that.

1372
01:01:39,440 --> 01:01:42,680
I don't even know what pizza place he was talking about.

1373
01:01:42,680 --> 01:01:46,660
Here's another one, and this is, I do not know where he was when he said this, he was

1374
01:01:46,660 --> 01:01:51,040
going on vacation, but this is the exact text I got from our dad.

1375
01:01:51,040 --> 01:01:54,280
We finally got here, and Richard Gere can blow me.

1376
01:01:54,280 --> 01:01:58,920
That was from his shitty vacation in Rodinth.

1377
01:01:58,920 --> 01:02:01,040
How about this, Jim?

1378
01:02:01,040 --> 01:02:02,540
Oh, can we do this every week?

1379
01:02:02,540 --> 01:02:04,320
This is so great.

1380
01:02:04,320 --> 01:02:06,440
French steward on Community.

1381
01:02:06,440 --> 01:02:09,200
Brilliant.

1382
01:02:09,200 --> 01:02:12,080
That says, here's one, July 17th.

1383
01:02:12,080 --> 01:02:19,640
We lost Donald Sobel, that is of course Donald Sobel, author of Encyclopedia Brown books.

1384
01:02:19,640 --> 01:02:23,680
Oh man.

1385
01:02:23,680 --> 01:02:26,480
After his vacation, we are home.

1386
01:02:26,480 --> 01:02:27,480
Don't get the tuna.

1387
01:02:27,480 --> 01:02:28,480
What?

1388
01:02:28,480 --> 01:02:29,480
Tuna?

1389
01:02:29,480 --> 01:02:30,480
What place?

1390
01:02:30,480 --> 01:02:31,480
You have to help me order that.

1391
01:02:31,480 --> 01:02:33,360
Hey dad, I love you very much.

1392
01:02:33,360 --> 01:02:35,320
Don't have the tuna, and do try ceviche.

1393
01:02:35,320 --> 01:02:38,320
Dad, you're the best.

1394
01:02:38,320 --> 01:02:39,320
Thanks dad.

1395
01:02:39,320 --> 01:02:40,800
Dad, I love you so much.

1396
01:02:40,800 --> 01:02:44,040
Your text light up my life.

1397
01:02:44,040 --> 01:02:46,040
These texts, us reading them out loud.

1398
01:02:46,040 --> 01:02:47,040
They're the poorest representation.

1399
01:02:47,040 --> 01:02:48,040
They are.

1400
01:02:48,040 --> 01:02:50,760
They make him sound completely incompetent.

1401
01:02:50,760 --> 01:02:53,480
He's a very, very smart man.

1402
01:02:53,480 --> 01:02:57,680
I just don't think he understands the medium, much like I don't think anybody over the age

1403
01:02:57,680 --> 01:02:59,640
of 43 dies.

1404
01:02:59,640 --> 01:03:04,520
Listen, I'm 31, so I'm going to have to lower that bar to like 30, because I don't get it

1405
01:03:04,520 --> 01:03:05,520
either.

1406
01:03:05,520 --> 01:03:08,360
I don't understand what these kids are talking about.

1407
01:03:08,360 --> 01:03:09,360
Emojis?

1408
01:03:09,360 --> 01:03:10,360
I don't get it.

1409
01:03:10,360 --> 01:03:16,360
You know what, I'm going to tell you a truth, do you guys know what emojis are?

1410
01:03:16,360 --> 01:03:17,480
No.

1411
01:03:17,480 --> 01:03:25,400
Emojis are like the little icons that are, like all Japanese phones support them, and

1412
01:03:25,400 --> 01:03:29,960
more phones are starting to support them here, but they're basically icons that are like

1413
01:03:29,960 --> 01:03:34,080
emoticons, but they're actually like little pictures that you can use to convey emotion

1414
01:03:34,080 --> 01:03:36,440
as part of your text.

1415
01:03:36,440 --> 01:03:39,320
So they are highbrow emoticons.

1416
01:03:39,320 --> 01:03:41,520
They're highbrow, high flute emoticons.

1417
01:03:41,520 --> 01:03:43,200
They're next-gen emoticons.

1418
01:03:43,200 --> 01:03:49,160
They're next-gen emoticons, they're called emojis, and true story, for about three months

1419
01:03:49,160 --> 01:03:54,040
after I first heard the term, I thought it was a fun slang for emotions.

1420
01:03:54,040 --> 01:03:57,160
Like I'm feeling some powerful emojis, you guys.

1421
01:03:57,160 --> 01:04:00,280
Guys, I feel so many emojis right now.

1422
01:04:00,280 --> 01:04:04,440
So I'd like to try to repurpose that for that purpose.

1423
01:04:04,440 --> 01:04:09,280
I am currently getting ready to ask my girlfriend of four years to marry me, but a bit of an

1424
01:04:09,280 --> 01:04:10,920
issue has come up.

1425
01:04:10,920 --> 01:04:14,500
While talking to her recently, she mentioned that her parents were a bit concerned that

1426
01:04:14,500 --> 01:04:17,400
I had not yet talked to them concerning my proposal.

1427
01:04:17,400 --> 01:04:19,560
She threw me for a loop.

1428
01:04:19,560 --> 01:04:23,800
Is talking to her parents, namely her father, who thinks I'm a screw-up, necessary in this

1429
01:04:23,800 --> 01:04:28,080
day and age, or is that tradition that went away in the 50s?

1430
01:04:28,080 --> 01:04:29,560
That's from Confused in California.

1431
01:04:29,560 --> 01:04:32,280
No, it's still very much a thing.

1432
01:04:32,280 --> 01:04:38,840
Yeah, so I've only ever gotten engaged the one time, but my thought on this is whatever

1433
01:04:38,840 --> 01:04:42,720
they think is a tradition is the tradition.

1434
01:04:42,720 --> 01:04:50,560
Yeah, I think you should probably get a read on how traditional they are, which I think

1435
01:04:50,560 --> 01:04:53,240
is going to help you to light your way here.

1436
01:04:53,240 --> 01:05:03,840
I don't think that this gesture would ever be... I do understand there's inherent sexism

1437
01:05:03,840 --> 01:05:12,320
in the gesture, but I don't think that it's necessarily going to offend anyone doing it.

1438
01:05:12,320 --> 01:05:17,680
I mean, I think you run a much greater risk of offending people by not doing it.

1439
01:05:17,680 --> 01:05:21,600
Oh yeah, like Teresa's parents... I was talking with Teresa before I did it, and I was like,

1440
01:05:21,600 --> 01:05:24,080
I want to talk to your parents first, and she was like, they don't care, don't worry

1441
01:05:24,080 --> 01:05:25,080
about it.

1442
01:05:25,080 --> 01:05:26,580
And I was like, yeah, but I do.

1443
01:05:26,580 --> 01:05:31,040
And it was still a very nice moment, even though it's not like if I had proposed without

1444
01:05:31,040 --> 01:05:33,640
asking, they would have been super offended or anything.

1445
01:05:33,640 --> 01:05:36,120
Can you guys tell me... It was just a nice moment for us.

1446
01:05:36,120 --> 01:05:37,600
I want to hear your stories.

1447
01:05:37,600 --> 01:05:40,560
I want to hear stories from Justin, and I want to hear stories from Travis about how

1448
01:05:40,560 --> 01:05:41,560
this talk went.

1449
01:05:41,560 --> 01:05:42,560
Oh my God.

1450
01:05:42,560 --> 01:05:44,600
Because Justin, I know yours was kind of a panic attack.

1451
01:05:44,600 --> 01:05:52,840
I'm not good at anything that happens in this whole procedure, and I asked my now mother-in-law

1452
01:05:52,840 --> 01:06:00,400
if she and my father-in-law could meet me at their house on their lunch break.

1453
01:06:00,400 --> 01:06:02,000
Which I love.

1454
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:04,840
And I'm like, come on back to the house, let's just talk this through.

1455
01:06:04,840 --> 01:06:07,080
Because you start out by inconveniencing them.

1456
01:06:07,080 --> 01:06:08,080
I know.

1457
01:06:08,080 --> 01:06:09,080
That's nice.

1458
01:06:09,080 --> 01:06:10,080
I like that.

1459
01:06:10,080 --> 01:06:11,140
This is like full panic attack.

1460
01:06:11,140 --> 01:06:17,960
And I ask them, I say, well, I'd like to... They guessed, they knew the jig was up.

1461
01:06:17,960 --> 01:06:18,960
And I am like-

1462
01:06:18,960 --> 01:06:20,760
They somehow put two and two together?

1463
01:06:20,760 --> 01:06:24,960
What if you just got them some subs, some Subway subs, and they just called and you

1464
01:06:24,960 --> 01:06:28,280
thought, I just thought this would be a nice thing for us to do together, if we had Subway

1465
01:06:28,280 --> 01:06:29,280
Sub Wednesdays.

1466
01:06:29,280 --> 01:06:31,560
Would you come back to the house on your lunch break please?

1467
01:06:31,560 --> 01:06:34,840
I want to point out all the messes you need to clean up.

1468
01:06:34,840 --> 01:06:42,400
Listen, I'm in the middle of asking, and they say yes, and then my now father-in-law says,

1469
01:06:42,400 --> 01:06:49,520
I would like to ask that you would consider maybe holding off on getting married until

1470
01:06:49,520 --> 01:06:53,460
after she had finished medical school, because I wouldn't want anything to get in the way

1471
01:06:53,460 --> 01:06:54,460
of that.

1472
01:06:54,460 --> 01:07:01,040
And that was three years away, so I slap my hand down on the table, I was like, listen,

1473
01:07:01,040 --> 01:07:02,040
back off.

1474
01:07:02,040 --> 01:07:03,040
I don't, this part of the story-

1475
01:07:03,040 --> 01:07:04,040
I don't remember that part.

1476
01:07:04,040 --> 01:07:05,400
I said, back off.

1477
01:07:05,400 --> 01:07:07,680
I think it's getting fictitious.

1478
01:07:07,680 --> 01:07:12,040
And then your nine foot tall father-in-law stood over you.

1479
01:07:12,040 --> 01:07:17,780
Even if your father-in-law was not a nine foot tall, I would say Conan-esque figure,

1480
01:07:17,780 --> 01:07:24,520
you would still probably not have the gumption, the vim to pull that maneuver off.

1481
01:07:24,520 --> 01:07:27,960
No, I just said, I'll think about it.

1482
01:07:27,960 --> 01:07:29,120
No one's ever brought it up again.

1483
01:07:29,120 --> 01:07:30,760
And then you got married six months later.

1484
01:07:30,760 --> 01:07:31,760
Yeah.

1485
01:07:31,760 --> 01:07:32,760
I got married six months later.

1486
01:07:32,760 --> 01:07:33,760
That was my play there.

1487
01:07:33,760 --> 01:07:34,760
I worked out pretty good.

1488
01:07:34,760 --> 01:07:37,080
Didn't send him an invitation to the wedding until the day before.

1489
01:07:37,080 --> 01:07:38,080
Yeah.

1490
01:07:38,080 --> 01:07:39,080
He just didn't bring it up again.

1491
01:07:39,080 --> 01:07:40,080
So I was like, well, I guess this is cool.

1492
01:07:40,080 --> 01:07:41,240
I guess we're cool.

1493
01:07:41,240 --> 01:07:45,040
Now to be fair, you really did tie Sydney down while she was in med school.

1494
01:07:45,040 --> 01:07:46,040
Are you kidding me?

1495
01:07:46,040 --> 01:07:47,040
I-

1496
01:07:47,040 --> 01:07:48,640
You burned all her books.

1497
01:07:48,640 --> 01:07:49,640
The crazy thing about-

1498
01:07:49,640 --> 01:07:50,640
You wouldn't let her go to class.

1499
01:07:50,640 --> 01:07:54,760
The crazy thing about his assertion is that I would ever do anything to get away of me

1500
01:07:54,760 --> 01:07:55,760
making that money.

1501
01:07:55,760 --> 01:07:56,760
I know.

1502
01:07:56,760 --> 01:07:58,760
I gotta get paid.

1503
01:07:58,760 --> 01:08:03,760
But, Travis, yours, I imagine, was much smoother.

1504
01:08:03,760 --> 01:08:10,840
Well, I mean, it was in the fact that we took them out to dinner in Dayton, so they didn't

1505
01:08:10,840 --> 01:08:13,120
have to drive down to Cincinnati or anything.

1506
01:08:13,120 --> 01:08:14,120
But-

1507
01:08:14,120 --> 01:08:16,640
Can you drive down to Cincy on your lunch break?

1508
01:08:16,640 --> 01:08:22,640
My plan originally was when Teresa gets up from the table, use the bathroom or something,

1509
01:08:22,640 --> 01:08:26,400
or she goes away to check on whatever, I'll do it.

1510
01:08:26,400 --> 01:08:30,880
And I told Teresa that at about 10 minutes in, 15 minutes in, she's like, well, I'll

1511
01:08:30,880 --> 01:08:31,880
be right back.

1512
01:08:31,880 --> 01:08:32,880
I'm gonna go to the bathroom.

1513
01:08:32,880 --> 01:08:35,960
And I stood up with her and walked over and was like, I'm not gonna do it until you come

1514
01:08:35,960 --> 01:08:36,960
back.

1515
01:08:36,960 --> 01:08:37,960
I can't do this without you there.

1516
01:08:37,960 --> 01:08:40,000
She was like, oh, okay, cool.

1517
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:42,360
So I made her sit at the table while I asked her parents.

1518
01:08:42,360 --> 01:08:44,760
Pushed your courage to the sticking point, Travis.

1519
01:08:44,760 --> 01:08:46,680
I didn't at all.

1520
01:08:46,680 --> 01:08:48,560
I was so freaked out in that moment.

1521
01:08:48,560 --> 01:08:54,440
Travis, I would like to formally request that you start referring to me as King Nuggets.

1522
01:08:54,440 --> 01:08:58,920
The King of Having Nuggets, that is the full title.

1523
01:08:58,920 --> 01:08:59,920
The thing is-

1524
01:08:59,920 --> 01:09:03,360
Let me just hear it once and kind of try it on for his eyes.

1525
01:09:03,360 --> 01:09:06,080
So here's the thing, King Nuggets.

1526
01:09:06,080 --> 01:09:10,920
Now, Travis, who is it that she doesn't have to impress?

1527
01:09:10,920 --> 01:09:11,920
It's you.

1528
01:09:11,920 --> 01:09:14,480
No, and then who is that again?

1529
01:09:14,480 --> 01:09:15,480
You King Nugget.

1530
01:09:15,480 --> 01:09:16,480
Thank you.

1531
01:09:16,480 --> 01:09:17,480
Thank you.

1532
01:09:17,480 --> 01:09:18,480
It's King Nuggets.

1533
01:09:18,480 --> 01:09:19,480
King Nuggets.

1534
01:09:19,480 --> 01:09:20,480
King Nuggets.

1535
01:09:20,480 --> 01:09:21,480
Nugget is adorable.

1536
01:09:21,480 --> 01:09:25,360
King Nuggets is his honorable and most venerable nugs.

1537
01:09:25,360 --> 01:09:31,720
Lord High Nugs of Nuggington.

1538
01:09:31,720 --> 01:09:38,280
King Nuggets sounds like who Mayor McCheese had to overthrow to instill democracy in McDonaldland.

1539
01:09:38,280 --> 01:09:42,760
My liege, there's been an uprising.

1540
01:09:42,760 --> 01:09:45,760
The fry kids are revolting.

1541
01:09:45,760 --> 01:09:52,080
Turn the vats of honey mustard.

1542
01:09:52,080 --> 01:09:56,920
Take my child McRib and get him out of here, whisk him to safety, return only when there

1543
01:09:56,920 --> 01:09:57,920
is calm.

1544
01:09:57,920 --> 01:10:01,000
And even then, momentarily-

1545
01:10:01,000 --> 01:10:03,000
Bring me the head of Grimace.

1546
01:10:03,000 --> 01:10:10,600
No, my lord, we don't know where the head starts, it just kind of slopes, having a hard

1547
01:10:10,600 --> 01:10:11,720
time figuring this out.

1548
01:10:11,720 --> 01:10:17,280
Let's find a thick part of the gradient.

1549
01:10:17,280 --> 01:10:25,320
Someone bring me Lord High Chester McPizza, he's been gone from our kingdom.

1550
01:10:25,320 --> 01:10:31,360
Advisor fajita, you've served me well these many years, now I must send you away to Toggle

1551
01:10:31,360 --> 01:10:35,440
Bell safety.

1552
01:10:35,440 --> 01:10:41,240
My liege, here comes Kid Vib the Kingslayer.

1553
01:10:41,240 --> 01:10:47,720
He's riding wheels like a beautiful chariot.

1554
01:10:47,720 --> 01:10:51,160
The kids club always pays their debts.

1555
01:10:51,160 --> 01:10:54,440
Oh, Christ.

1556
01:10:54,440 --> 01:11:02,200
Oh, the kids club does always pay their debts.

1557
01:11:02,200 --> 01:11:09,600
You could, I don't see why, um, I don't see why the horse can't be dressed like something

1558
01:11:09,600 --> 01:11:15,320
that people dress like, I remember one time a costume that I thought was pretty good was

1559
01:11:15,320 --> 01:11:19,120
I saw a guy dressed as Judge Lanzito.

1560
01:11:19,120 --> 01:11:21,520
So you want to dress a horse like Judge Lanzito?

1561
01:11:21,520 --> 01:11:24,660
From the OJ Simpson trial, I thought that was a pretty good costume.

1562
01:11:24,660 --> 01:11:31,080
So you could just dress the horse like, what's something people dress up like now?

1563
01:11:31,080 --> 01:11:32,800
Probably Dog the Bounty Hunter.

1564
01:11:32,800 --> 01:11:33,800
Uh huh.

1565
01:11:33,800 --> 01:11:37,880
Oh my god, Horse the Dog the Bounty Hunter?

1566
01:11:37,880 --> 01:11:39,720
What if I do?

1567
01:11:39,720 --> 01:11:45,640
What if you dressed as a hunter and you dressed your horse as like a wall-mounted head, like

1568
01:11:45,640 --> 01:11:49,600
you had to put something around his neck so it looked like his head was mounted on a wall?

1569
01:11:49,600 --> 01:11:50,600
That's not macabre.

1570
01:11:50,600 --> 01:11:54,040
Yeah, and you have to put the rest of him in a wall.

1571
01:11:54,040 --> 01:11:55,320
But then it's like pretty good.

1572
01:11:55,320 --> 01:11:56,720
You put him in a box.

1573
01:11:56,720 --> 01:11:58,160
Just stand still, horse.

1574
01:11:58,160 --> 01:12:04,200
I think that would be a pretty good, make it something like a plaque out of cardboard

1575
01:12:04,200 --> 01:12:05,920
and then just put, what about a zebra?

1576
01:12:05,920 --> 01:12:08,480
I mean, I feel like zebra's right there.

1577
01:12:08,480 --> 01:12:09,480
I know.

1578
01:12:09,480 --> 01:12:10,480
That's like a minstrel show for horses.

1579
01:12:10,480 --> 01:12:11,480
Oh my god.

1580
01:12:11,480 --> 01:12:12,480
What?

1581
01:12:12,480 --> 01:12:13,480
What?

1582
01:12:13,480 --> 01:12:14,480
Come on, you guys.

1583
01:12:14,480 --> 01:12:15,480
Come on.

1584
01:12:15,480 --> 01:12:20,480
Did you see what Daniel was wearing?

1585
01:12:20,480 --> 01:12:24,840
I couldn't believe it.

1586
01:12:24,840 --> 01:12:26,080
It's so bold.

1587
01:12:26,080 --> 01:12:30,040
Then two days later, you see Lady Gaga wearing the exact same thing.

1588
01:12:30,040 --> 01:12:31,960
She's so edgy.

1589
01:12:31,960 --> 01:12:32,960
She's so edgy.

1590
01:12:32,960 --> 01:12:33,960
She's in zebra-face.

1591
01:12:33,960 --> 01:12:37,120
It's unbelievable.

1592
01:12:37,120 --> 01:12:42,040
She's in black and white and black and white and black and white and black face.

1593
01:12:42,040 --> 01:12:43,040
Unbelievable.

1594
01:12:43,040 --> 01:12:45,080
Didn't they make a movie about that called Bamzoozled?

1595
01:12:45,080 --> 01:12:46,080
Yeah.

1596
01:12:46,080 --> 01:12:47,080
Oh.

1597
01:12:47,080 --> 01:12:48,080
What?

1598
01:12:48,080 --> 01:12:49,080
Dang it.

1599
01:12:49,080 --> 01:12:50,080
What?

1600
01:12:50,080 --> 01:12:51,080
There are 10 people out there that will laugh at that joke.

1601
01:12:51,080 --> 01:12:52,080
No, there are.

1602
01:12:52,080 --> 01:12:55,720
There are 10 people who will go, oh yeah, like bamboozled, and then they'll turn off

1603
01:12:55,720 --> 01:12:58,640
our show, and then they'll throw their computer away.

1604
01:12:58,640 --> 01:13:00,640
Just so I can quantify, did you just say bamzoozled?

1605
01:13:00,640 --> 01:13:01,640
Yeah.

1606
01:13:01,640 --> 01:13:02,640
I did.

1607
01:13:02,640 --> 01:13:03,640
Okay.

1608
01:13:03,640 --> 01:13:04,640
Okay.

1609
01:13:04,640 --> 01:13:05,640
All right.

1610
01:13:05,640 --> 01:13:06,640
I think it's all right.

1611
01:13:06,640 --> 01:13:07,640
I think there's meat on them bones.

1612
01:13:07,640 --> 01:13:08,640
Thank you, Justin.

1613
01:13:08,640 --> 01:13:09,640
Thank you, Chaz.

1614
01:13:09,640 --> 01:13:13,920
But why can't you just say like, we're having an evening, we're doing stuff, we're getting

1615
01:13:13,920 --> 01:13:14,920
together.

1616
01:13:14,920 --> 01:13:17,040
It's important to let people know what they're coming, like what they're coming into.

1617
01:13:17,040 --> 01:13:18,040
Yeah.

1618
01:13:18,040 --> 01:13:21,600
You want to establish the vibe, right?

1619
01:13:21,600 --> 01:13:23,200
So what would you call it, Justin?

1620
01:13:23,200 --> 01:13:24,200
I don't know.

1621
01:13:24,200 --> 01:13:25,200
I'm saying I don't have a good answer for it.

1622
01:13:25,200 --> 01:13:30,520
I think we've got to use a totally gender-neutral word for like, if you're eating like nachos

1623
01:13:30,520 --> 01:13:37,400
and steak, then what if we just called that like, dump?

1624
01:13:37,400 --> 01:13:39,640
And it's like a very- We're taking a dump.

1625
01:13:39,640 --> 01:13:40,640
No, no.

1626
01:13:40,640 --> 01:13:41,640
It doesn't have to be that.

1627
01:13:41,640 --> 01:13:45,280
It's just a word that sounds like the thing that it is.

1628
01:13:45,280 --> 01:13:47,080
It's dump night.

1629
01:13:47,080 --> 01:13:51,040
Come on over for dump.

1630
01:13:51,040 --> 01:13:57,000
And then if- Sunday, Sunday, Sunday, dump.

1631
01:13:57,000 --> 01:13:58,840
Don't wear your fancy khakis.

1632
01:13:58,840 --> 01:14:01,700
We're taking a dump.

1633
01:14:01,700 --> 01:14:06,600
I'm going to take that word back from the way that, honestly, the juvenile way that

1634
01:14:06,600 --> 01:14:09,400
you guys are using it.

1635
01:14:09,400 --> 01:14:12,320
I'm going to open a fancy Chicago restaurant called Dump.

1636
01:14:12,320 --> 01:14:15,120
Does it have like three E's in it?

1637
01:14:15,120 --> 01:14:18,480
No, it has one U with an umlaut.

1638
01:14:18,480 --> 01:14:19,480
Dump.

1639
01:14:19,480 --> 01:14:22,480
I just want- Come on down to dump.

1640
01:14:22,480 --> 01:14:23,480
We got steak.

1641
01:14:23,480 --> 01:14:24,480
We got stew?

1642
01:14:24,480 --> 01:14:25,480
We got steak.

1643
01:14:25,480 --> 01:14:26,480
Dump.

1644
01:14:26,480 --> 01:14:29,000
We got steak at dump?

1645
01:14:29,000 --> 01:14:30,000
Capex?

1646
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:38,720
Oh, the walls are just lined with plasma screens showing the choices.

1647
01:14:38,720 --> 01:14:49,680
We got all the freshest Angus sticks and all the choices cuts from Capex at dump.

1648
01:14:49,680 --> 01:14:52,520
I need like cash, baked goods, some that I can-

1649
01:14:52,520 --> 01:14:53,520
Some that I can-

1650
01:14:53,520 --> 01:14:54,520
Some that I can-

1651
01:14:54,520 --> 01:14:55,520
Something untraceable.

1652
01:14:55,520 --> 01:14:57,680
Some that I can trade when the revolution comes.

1653
01:14:57,680 --> 01:15:00,800
Some sky high stocks.

1654
01:15:00,800 --> 01:15:02,560
Something I can barter with, you know?

1655
01:15:02,560 --> 01:15:04,420
Just something to get us out of the country.

1656
01:15:04,420 --> 01:15:06,400
Give me some of that barter paper they call money.

1657
01:15:06,400 --> 01:15:08,520
Do you guys want the Founding IHOO?

1658
01:15:08,520 --> 01:15:10,840
Yeah, please, God, save me from myself.

1659
01:15:10,840 --> 01:15:12,520
This Founding IHOO was sent by Emily Wall.

1660
01:15:12,520 --> 01:15:14,960
Oh, man, that's so good.

1661
01:15:14,960 --> 01:15:21,480
The following 11 words, I feel like, summarize this human being more than any 11 words could

1662
01:15:21,480 --> 01:15:23,280
ever summarize any other human being.

1663
01:15:23,280 --> 01:15:31,120
It's by Yahoo Answers user Trevor, who asks, is it possible for a ferret to hide a fushigi

1664
01:15:31,120 --> 01:15:51,880
ball?
