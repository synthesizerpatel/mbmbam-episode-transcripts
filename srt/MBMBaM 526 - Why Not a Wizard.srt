1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:30,800
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:46,560
Hello, everybody. Welcome to My Brother, My Brother, Me,

6
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:49,760
an advice show for the modern era. I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy.

7
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:52,000
I'm your middle brother, Travis McElroy.

8
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,480
I'm the mystical, magical, illusionist, entertainer, David Blaine.

9
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:59,520
David, so happy to have you here. Wow, what an honor.

10
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:05,440
Sorry, I got delayed by some crosswinds over Milwaukee,

11
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:08,800
and so it delayed me coming into the studio today.

12
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:15,840
Just a few days after your dramatic ascent, holding a lot of balloons,

13
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:18,880
upping yourself is what the kids call it.

14
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:25,200
Yeah, I did an up, and it was an exhilarating journey that brought the country together,

15
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:32,960
and it was an illusion, and also I liked doing it a lot, and I had a lot of fun doing it.

16
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:35,760
So that's the only means of conveyance you're using.

17
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:39,520
So now I do it all the time, because when you get on an airplane,

18
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:45,440
they aren't doing a great job of the social distancing.

19
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:46,720
Have you guys heard about this?

20
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:48,320
No.

21
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:56,800
You might have been, David, you got up to 24,900 feet.

22
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:02,480
You must have been the most socially distanced person on the planet.

23
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:08,320
Well, I was until one of my balloons popped and it released the stinky breath of a sick man.

24
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:14,880
The balloons were all blown up by a big man with powerful breath,

25
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:19,040
and I found out later he was sick with it.

26
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:19,920
So I don't know.

27
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:23,440
It was, again, the crosswinds may have diluted it somewhat.

28
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:26,960
That may have been smilex gas.

29
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:28,480
You know how the Joker do.

30
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:31,360
The Joker's always on my nuts.

31
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:37,440
Can I give you, I just want to say thank you, Mr. Blaine,

32
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:48,000
because it is amazing how your balloon trip captivated the hearts and minds of everyone.

33
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:54,800
And for days now, it's all anyone has been talking about across all social.

34
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:56,800
It's literally the only thing being discussed.

35
00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:01,920
It is, I think, the first thing that has distracted everyone from everything.

36
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:02,800
It's amazing.

37
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:09,200
I actually, as interested as I'm here to hear him to hear about David's experience with the balloon,

38
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:10,880
I'd like to talk about my experience,

39
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:20,960
which is I saw on Twitter about a half hour after it ended that it had happened.

40
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:23,840
I was like, oh, man, I didn't fucking hear about that.

41
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:24,480
He did what?

42
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:31,360
I like to pretend that David Blaine was like, if I could tell him that personally,

43
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:35,680
like, I know you went up in the air with balloons you're holding,

44
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:38,640
but I didn't find out about it till later and I couldn't be bothered.

45
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:43,760
And then David, by the way, when I did watch it, I did skip around quite a bit.

46
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:48,320
Your journey and your ascension and decline, even your falling,

47
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:50,720
even your falling through the fucking air.

48
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:51,840
I was like, eh.

49
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:52,800
It took a minute.

50
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:54,480
David, can I ask, because it kind of seems to be-

51
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:58,560
Wow, you sure aren't really giving me room to speak about my incredible sky journey.

52
00:03:58,560 --> 00:03:58,800
I'm sure you guys have been up to this.

53
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:00,400
No, because I do want to hear about it.

54
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:01,360
I do, David.

55
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:01,920
Yeah.

56
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:02,560
David, I do.

57
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:08,000
But to Justin's point, it kind of seems to me like maybe that unlike,

58
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:12,000
you know, where you sat in a big fish bowl for a long time,

59
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:17,760
or you claimed to be frozen in ice, even though our daddy did that, and you-

60
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:20,320
Oh, wait, you're Clint's kids.

61
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:23,520
Yeah, yeah, yeah, the creator of the frozen in ice gag.

62
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:29,440
It kind of seems like this one wasn't like a publicity thing,

63
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:32,640
so much as it was just something you were going to do on your own,

64
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:35,200
and somebody noticed and pointed a camera at you.

65
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:38,800
It didn't seem like it was advertised in any way beforehand.

66
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:39,360
Is that true?

67
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,680
No, but we did a sort of street team advertisement.

68
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:49,200
But with the balloon, we tied it, like with the URL, we put it on some paper,

69
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:50,480
and we tied it to balloons.

70
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:54,320
But wouldn't you know it, the Dagnab things dang did flew up into the sky,

71
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:55,440
so no one could see them.

72
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:59,040
Um, David, I'd like to talk about one feature of your stunt

73
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:01,040
that I thought was so captivating.

74
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:01,680
Good.

75
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:07,440
Um, you're- I believe there's a young woman there who I believe was your daughter.

76
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:09,520
I don't know for sure.

77
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:10,880
Me neither, me neither.

78
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:17,280
But she attached the final balloon that began your ascent into the sky.

79
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:18,320
Put me over.

80
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:19,360
Yeah, put you over.

81
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:20,880
That was so lovely.

82
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:24,080
I wanted to know, did you consider the fact that if something

83
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:29,040
did go terribly wrong, she would have like YouTube live streamed evidence

84
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:31,600
that she could revisit for the rest of her existence?

85
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:35,120
Of that time, she killed her dad with a balloon.

86
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:37,680
Did you think about that outcome?

87
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:39,440
It's a part of the illusion, isn't it?

88
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:40,560
Well, there's no illusion.

89
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:43,200
No, whoa, you're very clear about this.

90
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:44,880
That was you in the balloons, right?

91
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:49,600
Unless, unless that was the trick, that was you in the balloons, right?

92
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:52,640
I never give it away, my secrets.

93
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:54,400
Okay.

94
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:58,320
I had an invisible, it was a very big ladder.

95
00:05:58,960 --> 00:05:59,600
There were some people-

96
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:01,600
Oh, wait, hold on, Justin.

97
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:04,080
I want to hear more about this giant invisible ladder technology.

98
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:04,320
Okay.

99
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:08,000
It was big, it was a big ladder, 10,000 foot ladder.

100
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,680
I didn't even get up the whole deck thing.

101
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:15,680
In these times when things are changing so much, I would like to repeat

102
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:17,680
a little bit of consistency in the world.

103
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:26,560
I showed your stunt to my wife who reacted the way she has reacted

104
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:30,160
to all of your stunts for the past decade.

105
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:33,360
She watched in silence and then said, that fucking idiot.

106
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:36,000
Well, every single time, David.

107
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,280
Well, it hurts my feelings, or does it?

108
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:44,080
What did Leo think of this?

109
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:46,400
Leo loved it.

110
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:47,920
I'm not sure who you're referring to.

111
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:50,320
DiCaprio, your friend, Leo DiCaprio.

112
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:52,080
You're friends with a lot of celebs.

113
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:53,680
Yeah, he liked it one time.

114
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:59,280
He had a watch and I made it not there anymore.

115
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:03,360
It was pretty badass.

116
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:04,560
What did Edward Norton think?

117
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:07,280
And then I threw up a frog, but that was unrelated.

118
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:10,640
Tell me about the time you set Edward Norton's shoes on fire

119
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:13,920
and then spit water on them so hard that they went out.

120
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:14,880
Yes, please.

121
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:17,760
Well, it was his fucking birthday.

122
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:24,000
I took him out to dinner at a Ruth's Chris

123
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:27,120
and they were doing it hibachi style.

124
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:28,720
Okay.

125
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:29,760
Yeah, go on.

126
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:31,440
This is a more thorough recount.

127
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:37,120
I'm not gonna say, I'm not gonna try to jump to conclusions here,

128
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:39,600
but Chekhov's gun, you've introduced the hibachi

129
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:40,800
and his shoes were on fire.

130
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:42,640
I'm having a hard time not connecting the two.

131
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:45,840
Yeah, that may be a fake though, it may be a red herring.

132
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:46,480
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

133
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:49,360
I get you looking over there at the hibachi table

134
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:52,960
and then when it happens, your watch is not fucking there anymore.

135
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:54,560
Whoa, you stole my watch.

136
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:55,280
Yeah, and then-

137
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:57,680
And you replaced it with Edward Norton's shoes?

138
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:59,520
Yeah, and then what's that in my mouth?

139
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:01,920
It's another frog, damn it, damn it.

140
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:05,680
Now, so how did the shoes come to ignite?

141
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:07,920
I'm not gonna give you all my secrets, but I-

142
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:10,000
Was that the trick that you made his shoes flammable?

143
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:14,320
Yeah, I took, I changed the stuff that it's made out of

144
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:18,080
into a sort of polyester of my own design.

145
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:20,720
I have my own shoe line of extremely burnable shoes

146
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:22,960
dropping this summer.

147
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:26,080
Oh wait, summer's over, I forgot, man.

148
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:27,600
I guess I just thought that the trick was

149
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:30,240
how much water you regurgitated upon his shoes.

150
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:32,320
No, hey, you wanna see me float?

151
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:32,720
Woo!

152
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:33,360
Yep.

153
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:33,860
Whoa!

154
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:36,640
Okay, I'm gonna float off, but anyway, yeah,

155
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:41,360
I got lunch plans with fucking Balloon Boy.

156
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:43,600
Me and Balloon Boy are gonna hit up Bruce Criss,

157
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:44,880
and you know what he's in for.

158
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:48,240
Say goodbye to your kids, Balloon Boy.

159
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:50,320
Cooking them up hibachi style.

160
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:55,840
Oh man, what a big get.

161
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:59,520
I mean, I had so many questions to ask him, I forgot.

162
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:01,120
Yeah, there's a lot.

163
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:01,760
What did you mean?

164
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:04,160
Hey, sorry, David, just real quick-

165
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:05,280
Attention!

166
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:07,920
How did you put my playing card inside the bottle?

167
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:11,520
Oh, the bottle isn't real.

168
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:13,920
Oh, fuck, yeah, okay.

169
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:15,760
I see that now.

170
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:17,760
Hey guys, David just floated out the window

171
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:18,640
in his big balloons.

172
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:21,920
Griffin, are you ready to start My Brother, My Brother and Me?

173
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:22,800
Yeah, let's do it.

174
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:24,320
All right, just press record, everybody.

175
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:24,820
Okay.

176
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:27,120
So this is a advice show.

177
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:29,200
Obviously.

178
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:31,040
Obviously, let's help people.

179
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:32,160
I live in an apartment building,

180
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:34,160
and today the windows are being washed.

181
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:36,400
Since I'm working from home in a tiny apartment,

182
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:38,800
my desk is six inches away from the window,

183
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:42,640
and a window washing guy just dropped into view.

184
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:44,240
We acknowledge each other and I thanked him,

185
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:45,600
and now I'm sitting here pretending to work

186
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:47,040
staring at my computer screen while this,

187
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:50,080
while this gentleman is literally six inches from me

188
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:52,480
staring back at me while doing his job.

189
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:55,040
I have a full cup of coffee and toast already on my desk,

190
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:57,440
so there's no excuse to get up and put it around the kitchen.

191
00:09:57,440 --> 00:10:00,160
The anxiety currently feels unlike anything I've ever felt.

192
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:02,480
How do I most effectively cover the fact

193
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:05,120
or convey the fact that I'm definitely working

194
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:07,360
and not just trying to avoid eye contact with him?

195
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:09,200
That's from working in Washington.

196
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:12,240
I think my favorite part of this question

197
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:16,080
is the conceit, the belief that if you got up

198
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:18,080
to go to the kitchen, the window washer would be like,

199
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:18,720
where are you going?

200
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:20,960
You got a full cup of coffee.

201
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:21,920
Where are you going?

202
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:22,720
Is this about me?

203
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:25,040
This is one of many questions,

204
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:27,360
and it's a sort of, it's a genre of question

205
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:30,480
that we get from our listeners who I adore

206
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:33,440
because we are so very alike, us and our listeners,

207
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:38,160
where you are assuming that this person's

208
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:42,160
sort of whole mindset is about you in this moment

209
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:43,840
because that's what anxiety does to you,

210
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:47,840
when really you can get up and they're not gonna,

211
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:49,040
they're not gonna pay you,

212
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:50,400
they're not gonna pay you any mind.

213
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:51,760
They're listening to the radio.

214
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:54,960
Or focusing on not falling to their death,

215
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:57,520
which is what I would be doing in their position.

216
00:10:57,520 --> 00:11:00,240
Yeah, they're on the clock and they're dialed in.

217
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:02,320
They're probably not concerned with you

218
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:03,920
or what you're doing or anything about you

219
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:04,640
because guess what?

220
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:05,840
They're gonna go by a bunch of windows

221
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:07,040
with a bunch of people working in them.

222
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:09,120
If they gave a shit about every single person

223
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:10,160
in every single window,

224
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:14,080
it would take up a lot of sort of emotional lift.

225
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:17,040
Now, okay, here's what I will say though, Griffin.

226
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:17,540
Yeah.

227
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:21,200
Speaking of putting ourselves in place of our listeners,

228
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:23,040
if I was the window washer,

229
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:25,200
I would, upon looking at every window,

230
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:26,400
think, what are they doing?

231
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:27,920
I think that like that-

232
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:28,960
Of course you would.

233
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:32,720
No, like, obviously you would because-

234
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:33,680
Every time?

235
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:34,960
This is what I wanted to say.

236
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:35,840
This is what I wanted to say.

237
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:39,280
These people are doing an incredibly dangerous job,

238
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:42,720
the fine people of the window washing industry.

239
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:44,480
That's a dangerous gig, I'm thinking.

240
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:46,080
They probably have some safety protocols in place,

241
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:48,880
but by and large, it's more dangerous than a lot of gigs.

242
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:49,680
It's just a bunch of balloons.

243
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:51,520
Letting them, and it's boring.

244
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:53,920
You know, it's probably a lot of times,

245
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:55,600
once you get into the rhythm, it's probably boring.

246
00:11:55,600 --> 00:12:00,400
You owe them, they have the right.

247
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:04,000
What I'm saying is we owe them a little bit of entertainment,

248
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:08,640
a little show, I think, just to help them pass the time

249
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:11,200
on the boring, dangerous thing that they are doing

250
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:12,960
for our edification.

251
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:14,480
Is that thing-

252
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:17,600
This futile act that will be undone by entropy

253
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:19,600
and the ravages of time in-

254
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:20,080
And birds.

255
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:24,080
A matter of days, and birds, thank you, Travis, and bugs.

256
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:28,640
Not bugs, just let them have a look-see at what you're doing.

257
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:29,760
Give them a show.

258
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:30,880
Just give them a show.

259
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:32,320
Don't let them know you're there though,

260
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:33,440
because that's not their thing.

261
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:35,680
No, but I do, it has just now occurred to me,

262
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:38,960
this is probably why Hitchcock called his movie Rear Window

263
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:40,240
instead of just Window,

264
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:42,240
because it would be a way different experience

265
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:45,360
in Rear Window if it was a cleaner six inches away.

266
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:47,360
Just like, hey, did you kill somebody?

267
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:49,520
Hey, I saw that, mister.

268
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:52,320
I'm right here.

269
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:55,280
You can pretend I don't exist like that guy in Washington

270
00:12:55,280 --> 00:12:56,560
that one time.

271
00:12:56,560 --> 00:13:00,160
But I'm right here, and I'm pretty sure you killed your wife

272
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:01,840
and maybe a dog in a bucket.

273
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:04,640
It's been a while since Travis has seen Rear Window.

274
00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:08,000
Why are you telling me about when Travis saw Rear Window?

275
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:11,040
Well, I'm just trying to share a brief moment of humanity

276
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:13,200
with you to bring us closer together.

277
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:15,120
Oh, you went in the kitchen, okay?

278
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:18,480
What do you do with all those creepy sneak-rits

279
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:21,920
that you find when you're going down the windows?

280
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:23,200
This is like code.

281
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:24,560
This is the sacred code.

282
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:25,520
Oh.

283
00:13:25,520 --> 00:13:28,160
Yeah, the sacred code of the window washer

284
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:31,760
is that you may watch all the secrets,

285
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:34,320
but you must lock them in an amulet

286
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:37,520
that you keep around your neck.

287
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:38,720
That powers you.

288
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:40,800
Yeah, you whisper the secrets into the amulet,

289
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:44,000
and that's what keeps your floating hover platform aloft.

290
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:44,640
Correct.

291
00:13:44,640 --> 00:13:45,440
The power of secrets.

292
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:46,960
Oh, it's not cables like in movies.

293
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:47,760
No.

294
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:49,200
No, no, no, no.

295
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:50,960
Those are just there to keep up appearances,

296
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:51,920
but they do nothing.

297
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:53,520
That's an illusion created by the amulet.

298
00:13:53,520 --> 00:13:56,560
How come every time someone gets on one of those

299
00:13:56,560 --> 00:14:00,160
in movies and TVs, it always falls?

300
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:00,880
Always falls.

301
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:02,400
Wouldn't get on one in a movie.

302
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:08,160
Like, I think the rate of incident

303
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:10,800
in which the window washer platform does fall

304
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:12,320
would have to be exceptionally low,

305
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:15,680
or else I would assume we'd just leave these bad boys dirty.

306
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:17,520
Do you think when window washers see that move,

307
00:14:17,520 --> 00:14:19,680
they're like, no, no, come on, that's not-

308
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:20,320
Come on.

309
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:21,840
Get its restraints on.

310
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:22,480
Come on.

311
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:23,440
That's not how it works.

312
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:25,280
It's got redundancies.

313
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:26,080
Are you kidding me?

314
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:26,400
What is this?

315
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:28,320
I have to assume it has redundancies.

316
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:29,200
Can I do a Yahoo?

317
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:32,480
I would like to see a scene in a movie

318
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:35,120
where somebody gets onto the platform and everything,

319
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:36,080
it's like tense music,

320
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:38,080
but then it's just like a half hour scene of them

321
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:39,760
figuring out how the controls work,

322
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:40,720
and then turning it on,

323
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:43,120
and then lowering themselves like a hundred floors,

324
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:44,640
and then getting off at the bottom,

325
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:47,440
and then like, I don't know, getting in a cab, you know?

326
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:49,520
I'd like to see a scene where the green goblin

327
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:51,440
knocks a window washer's platform down,

328
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:52,320
and Spider-Man's like,

329
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:53,440
oh fuck, I gotta get over there,

330
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:54,240
and he swings over there,

331
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:55,360
and the window watcher's like,

332
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:57,040
I had proper safety protocols in place.

333
00:14:57,040 --> 00:14:59,200
Yes, I mean, there's redundancies.

334
00:14:59,200 --> 00:14:59,520
I'm fine.

335
00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:00,720
There's redundancies, of course.

336
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:04,160
If you're a window washer listening to podcasts,

337
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:06,080
please get at us and let us know,

338
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:08,720
I guess, everything that's going on over there.

339
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:10,800
Yeah, give us a play-by-play of what you see.

340
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:12,960
Yeah, and describe your amulet in detail.

341
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:14,080
Yeah, be honest.

342
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:14,880
We'll know.

343
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:15,380
We'll know.

344
00:15:15,380 --> 00:15:18,580
Uh, here's a Yahoo that was sent in by Sean.

345
00:15:18,580 --> 00:15:19,460
Thanks, Sean.

346
00:15:19,460 --> 00:15:21,380
It's by Yahoo Answers user, Nope,

347
00:15:21,380 --> 00:15:23,700
who has a, he's got a question here

348
00:15:24,740 --> 00:15:26,900
that has been on the tip of my tongue,

349
00:15:26,900 --> 00:15:28,900
and Sean, Nope, has managed to put it into words

350
00:15:28,900 --> 00:15:30,020
in a way I never have.

351
00:15:30,020 --> 00:15:32,020
Thank you, Nope, for your bravery.

352
00:15:32,020 --> 00:15:37,620
Nope asks, why hasn't there ever been a wizard wrestler?

353
00:15:38,420 --> 00:15:39,380
Huh, huh.

354
00:15:39,380 --> 00:15:43,380
Like in WWE, the wizard wrestler would have special powers

355
00:15:43,380 --> 00:15:46,180
like controlling other wrestlers via telekinesis.

356
00:15:46,180 --> 00:15:48,580
He'd definitely be jacked and wear a speedo,

357
00:15:48,580 --> 00:15:51,060
but he'd also have a big white beard and a wizard hat.

358
00:15:51,060 --> 00:15:52,980
I did not read that part before.

359
00:15:52,980 --> 00:15:56,660
I mean, I did not vet that part correctly.

360
00:15:56,660 --> 00:16:01,140
I imagined more of a sort of Gandalfian vibe.

361
00:16:01,140 --> 00:16:02,180
Yeah, that's true.

362
00:16:02,180 --> 00:16:04,500
You were thinking more of a svelte,

363
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:06,820
not so much a beefcake, but perhaps,

364
00:16:06,820 --> 00:16:15,140
you know, like a svelte, jaguar-esque, you know.

365
00:16:15,140 --> 00:16:18,180
I was more thinking about the the the hemp and garments

366
00:16:18,180 --> 00:16:19,620
of a Christopher Lee,

367
00:16:19,620 --> 00:16:23,940
but not necessarily a speedo with rippling muscles,

368
00:16:23,940 --> 00:16:26,500
but I guess wizards come in all shapes and sizes.

369
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:28,020
Yeah, it is interesting to me, Griffin,

370
00:16:28,020 --> 00:16:30,180
that you assume that Gandalf underneath that robe

371
00:16:30,180 --> 00:16:31,620
isn't rippling with muscles.

372
00:16:31,620 --> 00:16:33,140
Isn't like huge.

373
00:16:33,140 --> 00:16:33,380
Yeah, maybe.

374
00:16:33,380 --> 00:16:34,020
You don't know that.

375
00:16:34,820 --> 00:16:35,860
Gandalf the Shredded.

376
00:16:35,860 --> 00:16:40,980
Wrestling has some, it requires remarkable athleticism,

377
00:16:40,980 --> 00:16:44,420
and there is obviously an inherent risk

378
00:16:44,420 --> 00:16:48,260
to every bout that happens in that beautiful cage,

379
00:16:49,620 --> 00:16:51,860
but also sometimes they do a make-believe.

380
00:16:51,860 --> 00:16:54,260
Yeah, that's interesting.

381
00:16:54,900 --> 00:16:56,980
I know that there's been a wrestler

382
00:16:56,980 --> 00:17:00,180
who would take off a sock and make you smell it

383
00:17:00,180 --> 00:17:01,940
so bad that you fall asleep,

384
00:17:02,580 --> 00:17:04,740
so I don't see why there can't be a wrestler

385
00:17:04,740 --> 00:17:09,460
who takes you over with his psychic powers.

386
00:17:09,460 --> 00:17:10,660
Would that be the problem, though,

387
00:17:10,660 --> 00:17:13,940
is that wrestling already has a sort of,

388
00:17:13,940 --> 00:17:15,220
we know this, this is not,

389
00:17:16,260 --> 00:17:19,380
there's a tenuous relationship to reality in wrestling,

390
00:17:19,380 --> 00:17:21,940
and they're constantly playing with that

391
00:17:21,940 --> 00:17:24,820
in a word that I will not attempt to pronounce

392
00:17:24,820 --> 00:17:26,260
because I've been saying it for 10 years

393
00:17:26,260 --> 00:17:28,260
and I've never managed to get it right, but it's-

394
00:17:28,260 --> 00:17:29,220
Kayfabe?

395
00:17:29,220 --> 00:17:29,780
Thank you.

396
00:17:29,780 --> 00:17:31,460
Sure, Travis had it this time, tweeted him.

397
00:17:31,460 --> 00:17:34,900
But I feel like introducing,

398
00:17:35,780 --> 00:17:38,340
it would be straining the bounds of believability

399
00:17:38,340 --> 00:17:40,420
if you did just have one wrestler show up

400
00:17:40,420 --> 00:17:43,940
and this one does have magical powers.

401
00:17:43,940 --> 00:17:47,460
It seems to me like people are okay with someone

402
00:17:48,020 --> 00:17:52,820
maybe being an undertaker and maybe being dead in some way

403
00:17:52,820 --> 00:17:55,700
and having a manager who may or may not be dead.

404
00:17:55,700 --> 00:17:56,420
That was an act.

405
00:17:57,140 --> 00:17:59,380
I think that if you're gonna have a magician character,

406
00:17:59,380 --> 00:18:03,620
the premise can't be I always loved wizards growing up

407
00:18:03,620 --> 00:18:05,780
and so I've styled myself as a wizard.

408
00:18:05,780 --> 00:18:10,260
It must be I'm a wizard who will win the fight with magic.

409
00:18:10,260 --> 00:18:13,540
I find it hard to believe that there has not been a wrestler

410
00:18:13,540 --> 00:18:16,260
who could perhaps mesmerize or hypnotize.

411
00:18:17,780 --> 00:18:20,820
I mean, we do have something like that now.

412
00:18:20,820 --> 00:18:25,140
There is someone who uses what I will refer to

413
00:18:25,140 --> 00:18:30,980
as just sort of swamp magic to cast people

414
00:18:30,980 --> 00:18:34,100
into sort of illusory hellscapes.

415
00:18:34,100 --> 00:18:35,220
That feels real.

416
00:18:35,220 --> 00:18:36,980
Yeah, that doesn't bother me.

417
00:18:36,980 --> 00:18:38,420
So we got that, right?

418
00:18:38,420 --> 00:18:39,460
Why not wizard?

419
00:18:39,460 --> 00:18:41,220
In the last Wrestlemania,

420
00:18:42,020 --> 00:18:46,020
the fucking Undertaker killed AJ Styles.

421
00:18:48,260 --> 00:18:49,940
Guys, he's a performer.

422
00:18:49,940 --> 00:18:51,300
He's an entertainer.

423
00:18:51,300 --> 00:18:55,460
Alan Jones fucking killed him

424
00:18:55,460 --> 00:19:00,020
and buried his dead ass six feet under the loam.

425
00:19:00,020 --> 00:19:01,220
Dust to dust, baby.

426
00:19:01,220 --> 00:19:03,140
This dude's dead as disco

427
00:19:03,140 --> 00:19:04,500
and then he's back the next week.

428
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:06,020
So why not wizards, I guess?

429
00:19:06,020 --> 00:19:07,220
What happened when he came back?

430
00:19:07,220 --> 00:19:08,340
Hold on, I am curious, Griffin.

431
00:19:08,340 --> 00:19:12,340
When he came back, was there any zombie theme?

432
00:19:12,340 --> 00:19:15,540
No, he was just kind of back

433
00:19:15,540 --> 00:19:17,860
and he was pretty peeved at the Undertaker,

434
00:19:17,860 --> 00:19:20,100
but they only do the Undertaker at Wrestlemania.

435
00:19:20,100 --> 00:19:22,180
So he kind of let bygones be bygones

436
00:19:22,180 --> 00:19:23,060
for another year at least.

437
00:19:23,060 --> 00:19:24,260
He got over it.

438
00:19:24,260 --> 00:19:26,020
He got over it.

439
00:19:26,020 --> 00:19:27,220
Maybe next Wrestlemania,

440
00:19:27,220 --> 00:19:28,740
he'll show up at the Undertaker fight

441
00:19:28,740 --> 00:19:32,820
and be like, I did not appreciate you killing my ass dead

442
00:19:33,460 --> 00:19:36,500
and putting me in the ground like a dead body does.

443
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:38,660
I think if you were going to have a wizard character,

444
00:19:39,380 --> 00:19:42,500
they would have to only be able to access their powers

445
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:44,900
once X had been accomplished.

446
00:19:44,900 --> 00:19:47,380
They could not walk right out the gate

447
00:19:47,380 --> 00:19:50,580
and blast you with a fireball or lightning or whatever.

448
00:19:50,580 --> 00:19:53,300
It would have to be like they got to power up

449
00:19:53,300 --> 00:19:55,380
via getting punched enough, right?

450
00:19:55,380 --> 00:19:57,780
Or maybe it's rage fueled magic

451
00:19:59,220 --> 00:20:01,700
or it's the cheers of the crowd, perhaps.

452
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:05,220
Yeah, I mean, we got Finn Balor who turns into the beast

453
00:20:05,220 --> 00:20:06,420
when he gets psyched up.

454
00:20:06,420 --> 00:20:08,420
There's a lot of people who transform

455
00:20:09,060 --> 00:20:10,340
into bestial characters.

456
00:20:10,340 --> 00:20:12,820
So why not a fucking wizard, please?

457
00:20:12,820 --> 00:20:16,740
It's such a shame that live audiences

458
00:20:16,740 --> 00:20:18,660
aren't permitted at wrestling events now

459
00:20:18,660 --> 00:20:20,820
because I would love to start seeing the crowd

460
00:20:20,820 --> 00:20:22,660
filled with why not a wizard signs.

461
00:20:22,660 --> 00:20:23,300
Yeah.

462
00:20:23,300 --> 00:20:24,660
Maybe once things,

463
00:20:24,660 --> 00:20:26,500
but I feel like the heat of this is going to be gone

464
00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:28,580
by the time we wrap up the COVID stuff.

465
00:20:28,580 --> 00:20:30,180
Could it be a social campaign?

466
00:20:31,140 --> 00:20:32,820
Hashtag why not a wizard.

467
00:20:32,820 --> 00:20:34,980
Tweet events, right?

468
00:20:34,980 --> 00:20:37,220
Well, you don't have to tweet at anybody.

469
00:20:37,220 --> 00:20:40,900
You can just tweet simply hashtag why not a wizard.

470
00:20:40,900 --> 00:20:45,060
How that's so that there is no wrestling connection to that.

471
00:20:45,060 --> 00:20:46,580
Oh, you don't think that's obvious?

472
00:20:47,140 --> 00:20:48,660
I didn't think it needed to be stated.

473
00:20:48,660 --> 00:20:50,820
I think that when someone sees that

474
00:20:50,820 --> 00:20:53,940
they will immediately think of the void in wrestling

475
00:20:53,940 --> 00:20:55,300
of being like, yeah, you're right.

476
00:20:55,300 --> 00:20:56,260
Why not a wizard?

477
00:20:57,300 --> 00:20:59,380
Bray Wyatt has swamp magic

478
00:20:59,380 --> 00:21:02,020
and he transforms into a beast.

479
00:21:02,020 --> 00:21:03,060
Well, he took both.

480
00:21:03,060 --> 00:21:03,940
He can't do that.

481
00:21:03,940 --> 00:21:04,660
That's what I'm saying.

482
00:21:05,540 --> 00:21:08,500
There should be, even if somebody's already got a thing.

483
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:09,540
Why not a wizard?

484
00:21:09,540 --> 00:21:11,620
Why not Roman Reigns?

485
00:21:11,620 --> 00:21:13,220
Some people are still not over.

486
00:21:13,220 --> 00:21:16,820
Just fucking give him telekinesis.

487
00:21:16,820 --> 00:21:19,060
It's so easy.

488
00:21:19,060 --> 00:21:22,500
Some sort of baby face person,

489
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:25,700
like one of the wrestlers that doesn't have a cool name.

490
00:21:25,700 --> 00:21:27,140
They just are their regular name.

491
00:21:28,260 --> 00:21:29,940
And like John Cena.

492
00:21:29,940 --> 00:21:33,780
Like John Cena who could come back as the wizard.

493
00:21:33,780 --> 00:21:36,580
Maybe a character, oh, oh, maybe that's the thing

494
00:21:36,580 --> 00:21:38,500
is Roman Reigns, Griffin.

495
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:40,740
You mentioned people, he was supposed to be a hero

496
00:21:40,740 --> 00:21:41,700
and then people didn't like him.

497
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:42,260
Is that correct?

498
00:21:42,900 --> 00:21:45,300
Yeah, I mean, that was ancient history,

499
00:21:45,300 --> 00:21:47,780
but still, yes, he's not over in some people's hearts.

500
00:21:47,780 --> 00:21:50,900
Perhaps he discovers his powers.

501
00:21:50,900 --> 00:21:53,460
They manifest one day while saving someone.

502
00:21:54,420 --> 00:21:57,300
And this is, it's not like, it's not retcon.

503
00:21:57,300 --> 00:21:59,700
This is a new development of like, yes.

504
00:21:59,700 --> 00:22:03,460
And also I saw a child about to be hit by a car

505
00:22:03,460 --> 00:22:05,860
and I magic that car away.

506
00:22:05,860 --> 00:22:07,940
Okay, so that's how I found my powers.

507
00:22:07,940 --> 00:22:10,660
He has this fantastical move where he cocks his arm

508
00:22:10,660 --> 00:22:14,340
like it's a shotgun and he does jump in the air

509
00:22:14,340 --> 00:22:16,020
and he punches somebody with this arm

510
00:22:16,020 --> 00:22:19,300
that I guess he has prepared in some way.

511
00:22:19,300 --> 00:22:20,900
He has loaded it in some way.

512
00:22:20,900 --> 00:22:22,420
So what if the next time he does it,

513
00:22:22,420 --> 00:22:25,380
he just cocks it and like a fucking lightning bolt comes out

514
00:22:25,380 --> 00:22:27,780
and he's like, whoa, what the fuck?

515
00:22:27,780 --> 00:22:28,740
Did you guys see that?

516
00:22:28,740 --> 00:22:32,500
And then we would do cussing in the WWE again.

517
00:22:34,340 --> 00:22:36,340
One of the cool things about having a wizard

518
00:22:36,340 --> 00:22:39,140
is that you could, he's unbeatable, right?

519
00:22:39,140 --> 00:22:41,220
Because of magic, but you could,

520
00:22:42,420 --> 00:22:46,260
like there's an object outside of the ring in our world

521
00:22:47,140 --> 00:22:48,820
where his power is contained.

522
00:22:49,460 --> 00:22:52,580
Because I think one of the things about wrestling that sucks

523
00:22:52,580 --> 00:22:59,300
is that it's always in that, the square.

524
00:22:59,300 --> 00:23:01,620
And I feel like if they had an opportunity

525
00:23:01,620 --> 00:23:03,620
to do some storylines that was just

526
00:23:03,620 --> 00:23:07,300
just the Undertaker rampaging through Detroit

527
00:23:07,300 --> 00:23:12,980
looking for the secret dagger of, we'll get it in post.

528
00:23:12,980 --> 00:23:14,260
Yeah, we'll figure it out.

529
00:23:16,020 --> 00:23:18,340
Yeah, oh man, that would be so good

530
00:23:18,340 --> 00:23:21,540
because I would love to see Vince taking part in it.

531
00:23:21,540 --> 00:23:23,060
Like, did you find the dagger?

532
00:23:23,060 --> 00:23:26,260
Like doing his very best acting.

533
00:23:26,260 --> 00:23:27,460
We have to stab the heart.

534
00:23:28,020 --> 00:23:31,140
You need to go into the ancient vault of Rylech.

535
00:23:31,140 --> 00:23:35,380
I think at some point I stopped describing wrestling

536
00:23:35,380 --> 00:23:37,460
and started describing shows.

537
00:23:37,460 --> 00:23:37,860
Yeah.

538
00:23:37,860 --> 00:23:40,100
But it would be cool if it was like shows.

539
00:23:40,100 --> 00:23:44,180
What if there was a companion television show to wrestling

540
00:23:44,180 --> 00:23:46,180
where they were going on adventures

541
00:23:46,180 --> 00:23:46,900
and maybe there were teams.

542
00:23:46,900 --> 00:23:48,820
You're gonna say if there was a companion character

543
00:23:48,820 --> 00:23:50,500
to the Undertaker, like,

544
00:23:50,500 --> 00:23:52,340
I know I don't have wrestling powers,

545
00:23:52,340 --> 00:23:54,180
but I'm here to provide celebrity.

546
00:23:54,180 --> 00:23:56,580
My name is Dirk Taker.

547
00:23:56,580 --> 00:23:57,780
I'm your son.

548
00:23:57,780 --> 00:24:00,100
I'm your son and I will find the dagger

549
00:24:00,100 --> 00:24:02,020
and I will stop the magic man.

550
00:24:02,020 --> 00:24:03,620
Griffin, are there any wrestlers?

551
00:24:03,620 --> 00:24:04,900
I turned 17, dad.

552
00:24:04,900 --> 00:24:06,580
I got my wrestling powers.

553
00:24:06,580 --> 00:24:07,620
I'm proud of you, Dirk.

554
00:24:07,620 --> 00:24:09,460
I'm proud of you, Dirk.

555
00:24:09,460 --> 00:24:11,940
Dad, I'm gonna be a nice guy who brings life.

556
00:24:11,940 --> 00:24:12,260
What?

557
00:24:12,820 --> 00:24:14,420
You've disappointed me again, Dirk.

558
00:24:14,980 --> 00:24:16,740
He's making a smack down to APU.

559
00:24:16,740 --> 00:24:17,460
Son of the Undertaker.

560
00:24:17,460 --> 00:24:19,220
Everybody, here comes Dirk Taker.

561
00:24:19,220 --> 00:24:20,420
Oh, he's got a dagger.

562
00:24:21,140 --> 00:24:21,620
You can't.

563
00:24:22,180 --> 00:24:23,620
He took that, Dirk.

564
00:24:23,620 --> 00:24:23,860
Hey, bud.

565
00:24:23,860 --> 00:24:26,100
No, he's got my dagger.

566
00:24:26,100 --> 00:24:28,420
Oh, the wizard seems pretty worried about this.

567
00:24:28,420 --> 00:24:31,220
For the first time, the wizard is worried.

568
00:24:31,220 --> 00:24:33,460
My power has been compromised.

569
00:24:34,340 --> 00:24:36,900
Oh, and it's the wizard's son, Tom.

570
00:24:37,620 --> 00:24:38,580
Hi, I'm Tom.

571
00:24:38,580 --> 00:24:40,660
I don't wrestle.

572
00:24:40,660 --> 00:24:43,060
Dirk Taker is swiping his knife at the...

573
00:24:43,060 --> 00:24:44,900
We gotta call this, guys.

574
00:24:44,900 --> 00:24:46,180
Oh no, the wizard.

575
00:24:46,180 --> 00:24:50,260
His skin is melting and the roaches that were ambulating his body

576
00:24:50,260 --> 00:24:52,260
have just started to disintegrate.

577
00:24:52,980 --> 00:24:53,460
That's right.

578
00:24:53,460 --> 00:25:00,180
He was just an ambulating skin shield for a bunch of living roaches.

579
00:25:00,180 --> 00:25:03,140
We'll have to see how this affects the rankings or whatever.

580
00:25:03,140 --> 00:25:06,420
I'm gonna run WWE to the ground just from like budgets

581
00:25:06,420 --> 00:25:09,380
on the effects we're gonna need for this show.

582
00:25:09,380 --> 00:25:13,700
I would want it to be some ratty ass Men in Black 1 era

583
00:25:14,500 --> 00:25:19,700
like PlayStation 1 low poly just sort of dissolving man effect.

584
00:25:19,700 --> 00:25:21,380
That would be so fucking good.

585
00:25:21,380 --> 00:25:23,060
God, we should write wrestling.

586
00:25:23,060 --> 00:25:24,260
God, they should let us do wrestling.

587
00:25:24,260 --> 00:25:27,700
Are there any wrestlers who their whole gimmick, their whole thing

588
00:25:27,700 --> 00:25:31,140
is that they always seem surprised to be in a wrestling match?

589
00:25:31,140 --> 00:25:34,100
Like maybe they were just like a fan who got up to go to the bathroom

590
00:25:34,100 --> 00:25:35,620
or like buy a program or whatever.

591
00:25:35,620 --> 00:25:37,940
And then it was like, wait, I'm a what?

592
00:25:37,940 --> 00:25:38,500
Huh?

593
00:25:38,500 --> 00:25:40,980
Oh, okay, Travis, this is perfect.

594
00:25:40,980 --> 00:25:44,420
The character's name is Phil Spigot and he doesn't want to wrestle.

595
00:25:44,420 --> 00:25:47,780
And what happens is the wrestlers have to go and find him

596
00:25:47,780 --> 00:25:50,180
and start the wrestling against his will.

597
00:25:50,180 --> 00:25:52,020
And he's just like in line for the men's room.

598
00:25:52,020 --> 00:25:52,820
You're right.

599
00:25:52,820 --> 00:25:55,140
He doesn't know the wrestling is about to.

600
00:25:55,140 --> 00:25:59,460
That's the problem is that all these wrestlers are waiting until the match starts.

601
00:25:59,460 --> 00:26:01,140
If you want to get serious about this,

602
00:26:01,140 --> 00:26:03,780
you need to start finding these people in their daily lives.

603
00:26:03,780 --> 00:26:04,820
Yeah, I'm pretty sure-

604
00:26:04,820 --> 00:26:05,780
Hey, where's Phil?

605
00:26:05,780 --> 00:26:08,500
I don't think he came to the wrestling match.

606
00:26:08,500 --> 00:26:09,860
I'm going to his house.

607
00:26:09,860 --> 00:26:10,980
I'm gonna find him.

608
00:26:10,980 --> 00:26:17,140
I think Braun Strowman was just like getting some pretzels at Smackdown

609
00:26:17,140 --> 00:26:18,260
and they're like, what do you do, man?

610
00:26:18,260 --> 00:26:18,820
Get up there.

611
00:26:18,820 --> 00:26:22,660
Dude, look at your fucking body.

612
00:26:22,660 --> 00:26:23,380
Get up there.

613
00:26:23,380 --> 00:26:26,820
Look at your incredible wrestler's body.

614
00:26:26,820 --> 00:26:27,620
Holy shit.

615
00:26:27,620 --> 00:26:28,580
I'm an accountant.

616
00:26:28,580 --> 00:26:30,980
Yeah, and no accounting for how big and beefy you are.

617
00:26:30,980 --> 00:26:31,620
Get up there.

618
00:26:34,100 --> 00:26:35,380
Actually, I'm an undertaker.

619
00:26:35,380 --> 00:26:36,340
Yeah, we get it.

620
00:26:36,340 --> 00:26:37,940
Yeah, right.

621
00:26:37,940 --> 00:26:39,860
I mean, I'm like a mortician.

622
00:26:40,820 --> 00:26:41,620
Well, that's taken.

623
00:26:41,620 --> 00:26:42,740
So you got to pick something else.

624
00:26:42,740 --> 00:26:44,980
You got to pick something else, but I am an undertaker.

625
00:26:44,980 --> 00:26:45,860
That's taken.

626
00:26:45,860 --> 00:26:46,500
It's taken.

627
00:26:46,500 --> 00:26:47,620
Can you be a wizard?

628
00:26:47,620 --> 00:26:48,580
I don't have powers.

629
00:26:48,580 --> 00:26:49,380
Damn it.

630
00:26:49,380 --> 00:26:55,540
Fuck, that would be great if like a big wrestler got to be the wizard.

631
00:26:55,540 --> 00:26:57,300
Yeah, just a big beefo.

632
00:26:57,300 --> 00:27:01,620
If Brock Lesnar shows up to the next wrestling match, I'm like, uh-oh, baby.

633
00:27:01,620 --> 00:27:02,740
Here we go.

634
00:27:02,740 --> 00:27:03,700
Suplex City.

635
00:27:03,700 --> 00:27:06,100
And he's like, no, I don't do that anymore.

636
00:27:08,740 --> 00:27:09,940
Check out my beard.

637
00:27:10,740 --> 00:27:13,940
My huge, mushy, vulnerable beard.

638
00:27:13,940 --> 00:27:18,260
He reaches into his fucking knife tattoo on his stomach and pulls out the actual

639
00:27:18,260 --> 00:27:18,760
dagger.

640
00:27:19,540 --> 00:27:21,620
He's opened a portal to hell.

641
00:27:22,260 --> 00:27:22,760
Whoa.

642
00:27:23,540 --> 00:27:24,100
Let me guess.

643
00:27:24,100 --> 00:27:26,020
You're going to suplex the other guy.

644
00:27:26,020 --> 00:27:27,300
I don't do that anymore.

645
00:27:27,300 --> 00:27:29,060
I don't suplex anymore.

646
00:27:29,060 --> 00:27:30,980
I use my mind now.

647
00:27:30,980 --> 00:27:36,900
I control time with the amulet around my neck, and I have a cape that moves on its own.

648
00:27:36,900 --> 00:27:38,740
Why would the wizard go into the ring?

649
00:27:38,740 --> 00:27:40,020
That's the question for me.

650
00:27:40,660 --> 00:27:47,060
If the wizard has these incredible powers, what storyline reason is there for-

651
00:27:47,060 --> 00:27:52,500
He could be just waiting for the wrestler to wrestle somebody else, eating some nachos

652
00:27:52,500 --> 00:27:56,020
in 37G, and then just blaze them, right?

653
00:27:56,020 --> 00:27:59,540
Well, the other wrestler said something mean about his girl.

654
00:28:00,340 --> 00:28:04,740
So he had to maybe smooch his mama or something.

655
00:28:04,740 --> 00:28:04,980
I don't know.

656
00:28:04,980 --> 00:28:06,580
I haven't watched wrestling since like 1998.

657
00:28:06,580 --> 00:28:07,220
That's bad.

658
00:28:07,220 --> 00:28:08,340
Let me give you this.

659
00:28:08,340 --> 00:28:11,140
His spells are powered by punches.

660
00:28:12,020 --> 00:28:13,460
That's what I said earlier.

661
00:28:13,460 --> 00:28:17,380
One spell, well, no, he's building spell energy, okay?

662
00:28:17,380 --> 00:28:19,220
So he has to slap the person.

663
00:28:19,220 --> 00:28:21,380
You know how sometimes they slap their belly?

664
00:28:21,380 --> 00:28:21,700
Yeah.

665
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:22,660
Don't you love that?

666
00:28:22,660 --> 00:28:23,140
It's fun.

667
00:28:23,140 --> 00:28:24,660
That seems friendly.

668
00:28:24,660 --> 00:28:25,140
It's fun.

669
00:28:25,140 --> 00:28:27,860
Now, is it by punching others or getting punched, Justin?

670
00:28:28,660 --> 00:28:29,860
It's not even punching, Travis.

671
00:28:29,860 --> 00:28:31,620
It's an open hand belly slap.

672
00:28:31,620 --> 00:28:32,980
Yeah, it's an open hand belly slap.

673
00:28:32,980 --> 00:28:37,460
I'm just saying that maybe the wizard's powers are powered by being punched by someone else.

674
00:28:38,100 --> 00:28:38,500
Okay.

675
00:28:38,500 --> 00:28:41,700
So they have to get punched to power up their powers.

676
00:28:41,700 --> 00:28:42,260
That's huge.

677
00:28:42,260 --> 00:28:43,540
That's cool too.

678
00:28:43,540 --> 00:28:44,340
We should write wrestling.

679
00:28:44,340 --> 00:28:45,380
Get at us, whoever.

680
00:28:45,380 --> 00:28:48,980
I'm just saying wrestling, if you want us to write you, get at us.

681
00:28:48,980 --> 00:28:52,740
Maybe it has to happen in a geometric shape and they're too lazy to make their own.

682
00:28:53,620 --> 00:28:55,780
So they just use the ring to do it.

683
00:28:55,780 --> 00:29:03,220
What if the three of us filmed a sort of indie demo tape of us wrestling using this great fiction,

684
00:29:03,220 --> 00:29:08,260
but we did it in the front yard where everyone could see it.

685
00:29:08,260 --> 00:29:11,620
And then that way people wouldn't think that like something unsavory is happening.

686
00:29:11,620 --> 00:29:12,340
It's in the front.

687
00:29:12,340 --> 00:29:18,900
This is three boys front yard wrestling with supernatural elements.

688
00:29:18,900 --> 00:29:21,540
I was going to suggest that perhaps we were all three wizards.

689
00:29:21,540 --> 00:29:23,940
And then I thought, what if that became the thing?

690
00:29:23,940 --> 00:29:28,820
Every wrestler is still themselves, but also everyone has powers now.

691
00:29:28,820 --> 00:29:31,700
We are basically, this is Mortal Kombat level.

692
00:29:31,700 --> 00:29:39,540
Oh yeah, that guy, he studied karate until he became a master and also can turn into a dragon.

693
00:29:39,540 --> 00:29:43,380
They are separate, unrelated, but two things that he can do.

694
00:29:43,380 --> 00:29:48,340
He is a very good fighter and also can shoot ice out of his hands.

695
00:29:48,340 --> 00:29:50,900
I mean, again, you're just kind of making show now.

696
00:29:51,540 --> 00:29:55,220
You're just kind of making Mortal Kombat, the TV show.

697
00:29:55,220 --> 00:29:58,740
But also there's a real human element to it.

698
00:29:58,740 --> 00:30:00,100
Okay, it's too late.

699
00:30:00,100 --> 00:30:01,380
You fucked up the pitch.

700
00:30:01,380 --> 00:30:02,260
No one's going to buy this.

701
00:30:02,260 --> 00:30:09,620
It's, you know, we're going to have to fall back on our old funding model, advertising.

702
00:30:09,620 --> 00:30:10,260
Oh, okay.

703
00:30:10,260 --> 00:30:12,180
I thought you were going to say selling plasma.

704
00:30:12,180 --> 00:30:14,420
No, I thought we were going to do the max fun drive again,

705
00:30:14,420 --> 00:30:16,980
but I don't think we're allowed to do that.

706
00:30:16,980 --> 00:30:18,820
No, Jesse said no.

707
00:30:18,820 --> 00:30:19,540
Okay, let's go.

708
00:30:19,540 --> 00:30:31,540
You know what I love?

709
00:30:31,540 --> 00:30:32,820
What do you what?

710
00:30:32,820 --> 00:30:34,420
Listening to things.

711
00:30:34,420 --> 00:30:37,140
And so that is why I enjoy Audible.

712
00:30:37,140 --> 00:30:39,060
They got audio books and so much more.

713
00:30:39,060 --> 00:30:40,500
They got original podcasts.

714
00:30:40,500 --> 00:30:42,980
They have like interviews with people.

715
00:30:42,980 --> 00:30:44,900
They got all kinds of cool stuff on there.

716
00:30:44,900 --> 00:30:51,860
I recommended this to, I think I recommended it to Justin and then we passed that on to dad.

717
00:30:51,860 --> 00:30:55,700
And I've passed it on my friend's audio book that I thoroughly enjoyed,

718
00:30:55,700 --> 00:30:58,660
The Seven and a Half Deaths of Evelyn Hardcastle.

719
00:30:58,660 --> 00:31:00,500
Oh my God, it's the best.

720
00:31:00,500 --> 00:31:07,300
If you love like mystery novels and you want to hear one like you've never heard before,

721
00:31:07,300 --> 00:31:13,060
The Seven and a Half Deaths of Evelyn Hardcastle is absolutely incredible and will blow you away.

722
00:31:13,060 --> 00:31:15,700
Okay, you haven't recommended this to me.

723
00:31:15,700 --> 00:31:16,900
Though I don't know why you guys are having a secret.

724
00:31:16,900 --> 00:31:20,340
Stuart Turton, the author of that actually has another audio book.

725
00:31:20,340 --> 00:31:20,820
What?

726
00:31:21,380 --> 00:31:27,540
Yes, it's called The Devil and the Dark Water that is coming out in October.

727
00:31:27,540 --> 00:31:30,740
So there's another Audible one for you to look forward to.

728
00:31:30,740 --> 00:31:35,620
Also, let's see Maureen Johnson's Truly Devious series is incredible.

729
00:31:35,620 --> 00:31:36,580
Can't recommend enough.

730
00:31:37,620 --> 00:31:40,420
I just listened to James Acaster's classic Scrapes,

731
00:31:40,420 --> 00:31:43,620
which is so funny.

732
00:31:43,620 --> 00:31:44,420
It's so good.

733
00:31:45,540 --> 00:31:49,300
And listen, let's all be honest, you got some free time, right?

734
00:31:49,300 --> 00:31:52,580
We all have a little bit more free time this year than we were expecting.

735
00:31:53,380 --> 00:31:55,780
So why not sign up for Audible?

Whoa.

744
00:32:25,060 --> 00:32:25,380
Yeah.

745
00:32:25,380 --> 00:32:26,100
Okay.

746
00:32:26,100 --> 00:32:26,420
Yeah.

747
00:32:26,420 --> 00:32:27,940
Oh, that's a weird energy.

748
00:32:27,940 --> 00:32:28,260
Well.

749
00:32:28,260 --> 00:32:32,660
Guess we gotta say that after all our ads now or else people are gonna think we're assholes.

750
00:32:32,660 --> 00:32:36,980
Well, I mean, listen, I know it's the first time we've said it.

751
00:32:36,980 --> 00:32:41,300
We've said it out loud in each other's presence, let alone to each other.

752
00:32:42,100 --> 00:32:44,740
Well, I thought you were talking about to the audience too.

753
00:32:44,740 --> 00:32:45,860
Well, no, no, I am.

754
00:32:45,860 --> 00:32:46,660
Oh, let me be clear.

755
00:32:46,660 --> 00:32:47,620
That wasn't to you guys.

756
00:32:48,180 --> 00:32:48,660
Okay.

757
00:32:48,660 --> 00:32:50,340
Well, okay, let me just take this for a spin.

758
00:32:50,340 --> 00:32:58,580
Raycon makes very, very stylish premium earbuds that have great sound and they got this new

759
00:32:58,580 --> 00:33:02,340
model Raycon does called the Everyday E25 Earbuds.

760
00:33:02,340 --> 00:33:03,940
I love you guys so much.

761
00:33:03,940 --> 00:33:04,260
Whoa.

762
00:33:04,260 --> 00:33:06,020
But these are their best earbuds yet.

763
00:33:06,020 --> 00:33:10,900
They got six hours of play time, seamless Bluetooth pairing, more bass, a more compact

764
00:33:10,900 --> 00:33:15,060
design and a noise isolating fit.

765
00:33:15,060 --> 00:33:17,300
And you guys are so special to me.

766
00:33:17,300 --> 00:33:19,140
Are you talking to us or the audience?

767
00:33:19,140 --> 00:33:20,980
The earbuds are stylish and discreet.

768
00:33:20,980 --> 00:33:24,900
There's no dangling wires or unsightly stems.

769
00:33:25,700 --> 00:33:27,140
Just pure machine.

770
00:33:27,140 --> 00:33:29,140
Just you and the machine, baby.

771
00:33:29,140 --> 00:33:29,940
I love you.

772
00:33:29,940 --> 00:33:30,900
Give them a try though.

773
00:33:30,900 --> 00:33:31,140
Wait.

774
00:33:31,140 --> 00:33:36,260
They have a 45 day free return policy so you can make sure they're the pair of wireless

775

786
00:34:16,500 --> 00:34:19,060
why should I not fall asleep first at a slumber party?

787
00:34:19,060 --> 00:34:20,260
How do I be fleek?

788
00:34:20,260 --> 00:34:23,380
Is it okay to break up with someone using emojis?

789
00:34:23,380 --> 00:34:25,140
And sometimes we talk about bugs.

790
00:34:25,140 --> 00:34:26,180
No, we don't.

791
00:34:26,180 --> 00:34:27,620
Nope.

792
00:34:27,620 --> 00:34:33,060

793
00:34:33,060 --> 00:34:35,940
a sister's guide to teens through the ages.

794
00:34:35,940 --> 00:34:37,140
I am a teenager.

795
00:34:37,140 --> 00:34:40,420
And I was too.

796
00:34:40,420 --> 00:34:43,060
Butts, butts, butts, butts, butts.

797
00:34:43,060 --> 00:34:43,540
No.

798
00:34:53,540 --> 00:34:54,340
I have another question.

799
00:34:54,340 --> 00:34:56,260
Oh, sure.

800
00:34:56,260 --> 00:34:56,660
Sure.

801
00:34:56,660 --> 00:34:57,220
Yeah, yeah.

802
00:34:57,220 --> 00:35:01,540
Yesterday afternoon, my roommates and I had a tie dye party where I brought the dyes and

803
00:35:01,540 --> 00:35:02,900
we were going to do a bunch of shirts.

804
00:35:02,900 --> 00:35:03,780
Of course.

805
00:35:03,780 --> 00:35:04,740
At least I thought we were.

806
00:35:06,340 --> 00:35:09,300
My roommates both only brought one shirt each.

807
00:35:10,420 --> 00:35:13,140
And then had fun dying some of my old t-shirts as well.

808
00:35:14,020 --> 00:35:18,660
Looking at their shirts now before washing, I'm 100% certain that once I unwrap one,

809
00:35:18,660 --> 00:35:22,500
it's just going to be solid yellow because she used too much dye and I didn't notice.

810
00:35:22,500 --> 00:35:26,900
This is going to be so disappointing, especially since now I have five cool shirts to her.

811
00:35:26,900 --> 00:35:28,580
One solid yellow shirt.

812
00:35:29,300 --> 00:35:30,180
What should I do?

813
00:35:30,980 --> 00:35:32,900
Try to fix it before giving it to her?

814
00:35:32,900 --> 00:35:36,260
Tell her now, almost 24 hours later, that I didn't notice she messed up?

815
00:35:36,820 --> 00:35:38,260
Throw it away and start a whole new shirt?

816
00:35:39,060 --> 00:35:39,620
Please help.

817
00:35:39,620 --> 00:35:42,020
I don't have much time before I have to get the shirts back.

818
00:35:42,020 --> 00:35:43,060
Holy shit.

819
00:35:43,060 --> 00:35:45,540
This is actually a surprisingly challenging question.

820
00:35:45,540 --> 00:35:46,020
Yeah.

821
00:35:46,020 --> 00:35:46,980
This is a tough one.

822
00:35:46,980 --> 00:35:49,780
That's from tie dyeing for an answer in Chicago.

823
00:35:49,780 --> 00:35:51,700
There's a lot of hair on this.

824
00:35:51,700 --> 00:35:53,140
A lot of hair on this one.

825
00:35:53,140 --> 00:35:56,980
There's a lot of flies in the ointment.

826
00:35:57,780 --> 00:35:58,980
Because they only got the one shirt.

827
00:35:58,980 --> 00:36:00,180
They took one crack at it.

828
00:36:00,900 --> 00:36:02,020
This was a mistake.

829
00:36:02,020 --> 00:36:04,980
You don't show up to a tie-dye party with one shirt because that's saying like,

830
00:36:04,980 --> 00:36:07,460
hey everybody, it's me, the world's best tie-dyer.

831
00:36:08,260 --> 00:36:09,860
Sit back and watch me do my fucking thing.

832
00:36:09,860 --> 00:36:10,980
It is a cold shot.

833
00:36:11,620 --> 00:36:14,340
This one shirt is going to be better than your five.

834
00:36:15,700 --> 00:36:16,820
I wouldn't trust myself to do that.

835
00:36:16,820 --> 00:36:17,940
It is a competition.

836
00:36:17,940 --> 00:36:18,820
You are competing.

837
00:36:19,460 --> 00:36:20,020
Yeah.

838
00:36:20,020 --> 00:36:22,580
What, are you going to tie-dye for the fun of it?

839
00:36:22,580 --> 00:36:23,080
No.

840
00:36:23,780 --> 00:36:26,500
You tie-dye so that you have a good product at the end.

841
00:36:27,860 --> 00:36:29,140
Yeah, it's not that fun.

842
00:36:30,260 --> 00:36:32,340
It's like, it's maybe for a child.

843
00:36:32,340 --> 00:36:32,980
You know what I mean?

844
00:36:32,980 --> 00:36:36,260
For a child, it's fun, but you really want the finished product.

845
00:36:36,260 --> 00:36:41,140
I went, my girls tie-dyed a shirt somewhere.

846
00:36:41,140 --> 00:36:42,020
I can't even forget.

847
00:36:42,020 --> 00:36:43,060
It's been years.

848
00:36:43,060 --> 00:36:44,260
But they were so excited.

849
00:36:44,260 --> 00:36:46,100
They tie-dyed their shirts and then they said,

850
00:36:46,100 --> 00:36:48,660
now you just leave it in this bag for 24 hours.

851
00:36:48,660 --> 00:36:50,340
Are you fucking kidding me?

852
00:36:50,340 --> 00:36:52,900
You might as well have told my kids to throw this in an incinerator

853
00:36:52,900 --> 00:36:55,780
and forget it ever existed for as long as that sounded.

854
00:36:55,780 --> 00:36:57,380
Tie-dyeing isn't fun.

855
00:36:57,380 --> 00:36:58,740
Some people like it, Justin.

856
00:36:58,740 --> 00:36:59,380
A lot of it's a-

857
00:36:59,380 --> 00:37:04,580
I'm saying it can be pleasurable as a craft, but as a layman, it's not fun.

858
00:37:04,580 --> 00:37:05,140
Okay.

859
00:37:05,140 --> 00:37:09,060
Well, there are many things, Justin, I would argue that for some people are fun to do

860
00:37:09,060 --> 00:37:10,820
and for others are incredibly boring.

861
00:37:10,820 --> 00:37:11,220
Sure.

862
00:37:11,220 --> 00:37:15,140
This is obviously, do I have to codify everything I say on the show as,

863
00:37:15,140 --> 00:37:16,980
this is just my perspective, but-

864
00:37:16,980 --> 00:37:19,220
This is just my skewed view.

865
00:37:19,220 --> 00:37:19,460
Right.

866
00:37:21,940 --> 00:37:23,300
Let's start doing options, okay?

867
00:37:23,300 --> 00:37:26,660
Number one, you give her the yellow shirt and you say, congratulations,

868
00:37:27,700 --> 00:37:29,540
you made a shirt yellow.

869
00:37:29,540 --> 00:37:32,100
And you didn't do what you were trying to do,

870
00:37:32,100 --> 00:37:36,420
but this shirt wasn't yellow before and now it is and isn't that empowering.

871
00:37:36,420 --> 00:37:38,180
You have accomplished something.

872
00:37:38,180 --> 00:37:38,660
You have accomplished something.

873
00:37:38,660 --> 00:37:40,420
You have changed the nature of something.

874
00:37:40,420 --> 00:37:41,540
It's very nature.

875
00:37:41,540 --> 00:37:44,340
And if they're like a bright summer,

876
00:37:44,340 --> 00:37:47,460
then this is really going to compliment them.

877
00:37:47,460 --> 00:37:48,180
You know what I mean?

878
00:37:48,180 --> 00:37:48,980
I love a yellow.

879
00:37:48,980 --> 00:37:50,100
I look great in a yellow.

880
00:37:50,100 --> 00:37:51,060
It's my favorite color.

881
00:37:51,060 --> 00:37:52,420
If you told me, hey, Griffin,

882
00:37:54,900 --> 00:38:00,260
your attempt to iron on this picture of the cast of Night Court on this shirt

883
00:38:00,260 --> 00:38:02,980
didn't go so well, but you did dye it straight yellow.

884
00:38:02,980 --> 00:38:03,940
You smudged bull.

885
00:38:05,220 --> 00:38:07,220
You smudged bull and made the shirt straight.

886
00:38:07,220 --> 00:38:09,460
Just a big stretched out-

887
00:38:10,820 --> 00:38:13,380
He looks like a thumb because you smudged his face

888
00:38:13,380 --> 00:38:14,340
and now it's just a thumb.

889
00:38:15,540 --> 00:38:18,900
No, Richard Mould takes up the entirety of the shirt,

890
00:38:18,900 --> 00:38:22,180
just his bloated, stretched out, ruined face.

891
00:38:22,180 --> 00:38:24,820
But you nailed Laricat.

892
00:38:24,820 --> 00:38:25,540
Laricat's great.

893
00:38:25,540 --> 00:38:26,500
He's just on the back.

894
00:38:27,780 --> 00:38:30,020
But no, if it's just yellow, then I'd be fine

895
00:38:30,020 --> 00:38:31,140
because it's still a good shirt.

896
00:38:31,780 --> 00:38:32,260
It's still a fine shirt.

897
00:38:32,260 --> 00:38:33,940
But if that wasn't your goal, Griffin,

898
00:38:33,940 --> 00:38:36,340
it's like if I set out to make chicken soup

899
00:38:36,340 --> 00:38:38,340
and I ended up with a fine gazpacho,

900
00:38:39,220 --> 00:38:41,540
I think I'd be disappointed and confused,

901
00:38:41,540 --> 00:38:44,100
no matter how good this gazpacho was.

902
00:38:44,660 --> 00:38:47,700
You have to have, I think you can fix it

903
00:38:49,220 --> 00:38:51,460
because when they open it,

904
00:38:52,180 --> 00:38:55,780
one, they're gonna be so delighted by this amazing thing.

905
00:38:55,780 --> 00:38:58,740
These circles of color, come on.

906
00:38:58,740 --> 00:39:00,100
They're gonna be loving it.

907
00:39:00,100 --> 00:39:02,900
But even if that moment passes, and it will,

908
00:39:02,900 --> 00:39:06,340
like all pleasure, I don't think they're going to have

909
00:39:06,340 --> 00:39:08,660
a moment where they say, wait a minute,

910
00:39:08,660 --> 00:39:11,300
did they tie down my tie dye?

911
00:39:12,500 --> 00:39:13,700
Well, unless.

912
00:39:13,700 --> 00:39:15,460
It's so inconceivable.

913
00:39:15,460 --> 00:39:16,660
No, I will not.

914
00:39:16,660 --> 00:39:17,140
I shan't.

915
00:39:17,140 --> 00:39:17,540
You have to go.

916
00:39:17,540 --> 00:39:18,420
I can't grant you this.

917
00:39:18,420 --> 00:39:19,060
You have to go.

918
00:39:19,060 --> 00:39:20,020
It's in the contract.

919
00:39:20,020 --> 00:39:20,580
Unless.

920
00:39:21,700 --> 00:39:22,820
Unless.

921
00:39:22,820 --> 00:39:24,900
They didn't want a tie dyed shirt.

922
00:39:24,900 --> 00:39:26,900
They wanted a yellow shirt.

923
00:39:26,900 --> 00:39:27,140
Fuck.

924
00:39:27,860 --> 00:39:28,740
God damn it.

925
00:39:28,740 --> 00:39:33,220
I hate, just once, I'd like to find some fucking black

926
00:39:33,220 --> 00:39:36,180
and white in this world rather than living my existence

927
00:39:36,180 --> 00:39:37,380
in perpetual shades of gray.

928
00:39:37,380 --> 00:39:37,620
Yep.

929
00:39:37,620 --> 00:39:38,980
But Travis is right, of course.

930
00:39:39,540 --> 00:39:41,060
That's entirely possible.

931
00:39:41,060 --> 00:39:43,620
They just wanted, they had a shirt that was one color,

932
00:39:43,620 --> 00:39:44,980
they wanted it to be yellow instead.

933
00:39:44,980 --> 00:39:46,500
That's entirely possible.

934
00:39:46,500 --> 00:39:47,940
That you said, we're going to tie dye him.

935
00:39:47,940 --> 00:39:50,580
They thought, I'm never going to wear a tie dye shirt.

936
00:39:50,580 --> 00:39:50,820
But.

937
00:39:51,380 --> 00:39:52,340
But hey, free dye.

938
00:39:52,340 --> 00:39:53,220
But hey, free dye.

939
00:39:53,220 --> 00:39:55,780
I have been looking for an excuse to turn this shirt yellow.

940
00:39:57,460 --> 00:39:58,580
Hey, can I do a Yahoo?

941
00:39:59,140 --> 00:39:59,620
Yeah, I'd love that.

942
00:39:59,620 --> 00:40:01,220
We didn't help that person at all.

943
00:40:01,220 --> 00:40:01,940
Not a bit.

944
00:40:01,940 --> 00:40:02,100
No.

945
00:40:02,100 --> 00:40:02,740
Not a lick.

946
00:40:02,740 --> 00:40:03,620
It's too hard.

947
00:40:03,620 --> 00:40:04,260
Can't do it.

948
00:40:04,260 --> 00:40:04,980
Things are rough.

949
00:40:04,980 --> 00:40:07,700
You finally hit something we can't help with.

950
00:40:08,340 --> 00:40:10,660
I think it's because we don't know anything about tie dye.

951
00:40:10,660 --> 00:40:11,460
That's the problem.

952
00:40:11,460 --> 00:40:13,220
I don't know if you can tie dye on top of tie dye.

953
00:40:13,220 --> 00:40:15,220
Once the shirt is yellow, can you dye again?

954
00:40:16,660 --> 00:40:16,980
So this.

955
00:40:16,980 --> 00:40:18,020
Can you dye it another day?

956
00:40:19,380 --> 00:40:22,340
This Yahoo is sent in by the wizard, Emma Cant.

957
00:40:22,340 --> 00:40:23,460
What do you think about that?

958
00:40:23,460 --> 00:40:24,740
Ooh, okay.

959
00:40:25,460 --> 00:40:26,420
Emma, thank you.

960
00:40:26,420 --> 00:40:27,460
It's an anonymous Yahoo answer.

961
00:40:27,460 --> 00:40:28,340
Why not a wizard?

962
00:40:28,340 --> 00:40:29,060
Why not a wizard?

963
00:40:29,780 --> 00:40:31,940
This one's by a Yahoo answers user.

964
00:40:31,940 --> 00:40:32,740
They're anonymous.

965
00:40:32,740 --> 00:40:35,620
So I'm going to call them Preston Asks.

966
00:40:35,620 --> 00:40:36,980
Oh, like Presta Digitation.

967
00:40:38,180 --> 00:40:38,500
What?

968
00:40:39,140 --> 00:40:42,580
Like Presta Digitation would be my wizard.

969
00:40:42,580 --> 00:40:47,780
My name is Preston Digitation and I'm here to change the world of wrestling.

970
00:40:48,580 --> 00:40:51,140
I also flip real good.

971
00:40:51,140 --> 00:40:52,740
Look at these flips.

972
00:40:52,740 --> 00:40:55,140
They are not magically enhanced.

973
00:40:55,140 --> 00:40:56,740
They're physical flips.

974
00:40:56,740 --> 00:40:58,740
And also lightning.

975
00:40:58,740 --> 00:40:59,540
That's hard.

976
00:40:59,540 --> 00:41:03,940
That's hard if you practice really hard to do cool flips as the wizard wrestler.

977
00:41:03,940 --> 00:41:07,940
You have to keep reassuring people that, no, I train to do those.

978
00:41:09,940 --> 00:41:11,620
Preston Asks.

979
00:41:12,740 --> 00:41:18,260
If you could combine two sports to make a new sport, which two would you pick and why?

980
00:41:18,260 --> 00:41:21,220
There's room right now for a new sport to take off.

981
00:41:22,020 --> 00:41:24,100
Football and jousting.

982
00:41:24,740 --> 00:41:25,700
Football and jousting.

983
00:41:25,700 --> 00:41:29,700
Travis did not even think about it before he went for football and jousting,

984
00:41:29,700 --> 00:41:33,460
which is kind of like polo, sort of.

985
00:41:33,460 --> 00:41:34,260
Walk me through it, Trav.

986
00:41:34,260 --> 00:41:34,980
What's it look like?

987
00:41:34,980 --> 00:41:39,060
Well, it's you have the big linemen, but they also have big pointy sticks.

988
00:41:39,620 --> 00:41:40,980
Does anybody else have big-

989
00:41:40,980 --> 00:41:41,940
Are they on horseback?

990
00:41:42,900 --> 00:41:47,140
No, the wide receivers and the running backs are sitting on the lineman's shoulders.

991
00:41:47,940 --> 00:41:49,300
Oh, so they're playing like chickens.

992
00:41:49,300 --> 00:41:51,060
Like at a pool, but they have-

993
00:41:51,060 --> 00:41:52,580
But they have big sticks.

994
00:41:52,580 --> 00:41:53,780
Big pointy sticks.

995
00:41:53,780 --> 00:41:56,660
Also, what about water polo and regular polo?

996
00:41:57,460 --> 00:41:58,180
That's cool.

997
00:41:58,820 --> 00:42:00,180
Now there's horses in the pool.

998
00:42:00,740 --> 00:42:01,540
Yeah.

999
00:42:01,540 --> 00:42:03,940
And don't get me wrong, the pool is shallower.

1000
00:42:03,940 --> 00:42:05,540
The horses can touch the bottom.

1001
00:42:06,660 --> 00:42:07,780
The horses aren't swimming.

1002
00:42:08,580 --> 00:42:12,180
So, but yeah, you've basically created the most dangerous sport

1003
00:42:12,180 --> 00:42:16,180
for if you do fall off the horse and get trampled underwater.

1004
00:42:16,180 --> 00:42:17,780
That's a duncey right there.

1005
00:42:18,740 --> 00:42:19,780
That's the season wrap.

1006
00:42:19,780 --> 00:42:29,700
Yeah, let's think about this because I think there's some sports that could serve as like

1007
00:42:29,700 --> 00:42:33,700
a really exciting modifier for virtually every other sport.

1008
00:42:34,500 --> 00:42:41,620
I think if we took NASCAR and blended it with literally anything else-

1009
00:42:41,620 --> 00:42:42,340
Jousting.

1010
00:42:43,460 --> 00:42:44,340
That's rough.

1011
00:42:44,340 --> 00:42:48,100
I'm trying to think of the safety of the athletes, Trav, and I guess I'm alone in that.

1012
00:42:48,100 --> 00:42:49,860
Okay, well then soccer, but with cars.

1013
00:42:49,860 --> 00:42:51,300
No, that's a game, isn't it?

1014
00:42:51,300 --> 00:42:52,020
It's a game.

1015
00:42:52,020 --> 00:42:52,820
Yeah, I think so.

1016
00:42:55,380 --> 00:42:56,180
You know what?

1017
00:42:56,180 --> 00:42:57,780
I'm gonna say, okay, picture this.

1018
00:42:58,340 --> 00:42:59,700
NASCAR, right?

1019
00:43:00,340 --> 00:43:01,380
They're going real fast.

1020
00:43:02,100 --> 00:43:06,980
But in order to win, you have to hit a ramp, pass by a basketball net,

1021
00:43:06,980 --> 00:43:09,140
and slam dunk it out of the car window.

1022
00:43:09,140 --> 00:43:10,020
That's cool.

1023
00:43:10,020 --> 00:43:11,380
See, now we're talking.

1024
00:43:11,380 --> 00:43:11,940
Yeah, right?

1025
00:43:13,300 --> 00:43:17,140
I think NASCAR and just, can I just say the X Games?

1026
00:43:17,140 --> 00:43:17,860
X Games?

1027
00:43:17,860 --> 00:43:18,360
Huh.

1028
00:43:19,220 --> 00:43:24,900
I would love to see a snowboarding car, like replace the wheels, I guess with like rails,

1029
00:43:24,900 --> 00:43:25,620
like skis.

1030
00:43:26,340 --> 00:43:27,140
Yeah.

1031
00:43:27,140 --> 00:43:28,820
And now they're doing a big jump.

1032
00:43:28,820 --> 00:43:29,860
I like the big jumps.

1033
00:43:31,380 --> 00:43:35,460
I mean, boxing and any other sport is like, but they fight.

1034
00:43:35,460 --> 00:43:37,700
It's like baseball, but they fight.

1035
00:43:37,700 --> 00:43:40,580
Well, they already fight in baseball sometimes, but they're not supposed to.

1036
00:43:40,580 --> 00:43:42,020
But you can win.

1037
00:43:42,020 --> 00:43:42,260
Yeah.

1038
00:43:42,260 --> 00:43:50,020
You play baseball and you're doing great, but say the Angels are down, nine zip,

1039
00:43:50,020 --> 00:43:52,100
bottom of the ninth, and they're like, hey, wait a minute.

1040
00:43:52,820 --> 00:43:55,060
Let's just fucking get these guys.

1041
00:43:55,060 --> 00:43:58,820
And so you go over there and you just start punching the other people in the dugout

1042
00:43:58,820 --> 00:44:03,940
until the ump is like, game, Angels, come from behind, victory.

1043
00:44:03,940 --> 00:44:04,440
Okay.

1044
00:44:04,980 --> 00:44:05,860
Here's my pitch.

1045
00:44:05,860 --> 00:44:06,660
Here's my pitch.

1046
00:44:06,660 --> 00:44:07,380
This is my pitch.

1047
00:44:07,380 --> 00:44:12,500
Okay, combine every sport individually, not like into one big mass.

1048
00:44:12,500 --> 00:44:18,260
I'm saying like this, like with capture the flag where you're playing baseball,

1049
00:44:18,260 --> 00:44:20,900
but also in each dugout, right?

1050
00:44:20,900 --> 00:44:22,020
There's a flag.

1051
00:44:22,020 --> 00:44:25,700
And if the other team is distracted and you can get over there and get it.

1052
00:44:25,700 --> 00:44:28,420
Same with like football, there's a flag on the sidelines.

1053
00:44:28,420 --> 00:44:30,180
Soccer, there's a flag in the side.

1054
00:44:30,180 --> 00:44:31,940
Like there's just a flag.

1055
00:44:31,940 --> 00:44:36,100
But if you can get their flag back over to your side while they're busy playing the game,

1056
00:44:36,100 --> 00:44:36,820
you win.

1057
00:44:36,820 --> 00:44:38,020
It's gotta be baseball, right?

1058
00:44:38,020 --> 00:44:39,300
Because I'm thinking about it now.

1059
00:44:39,300 --> 00:44:43,860
Every other like of the major sports has had the sexier version made of it.

1060
00:44:43,860 --> 00:44:45,220
We got slam ball for basketball.

1061
00:44:45,220 --> 00:44:47,460
We got XFL for NFL.

1062
00:44:47,460 --> 00:44:51,540
But baseball, I'm not even thinking of it like NASCAR can modify everything better.

1063
00:44:51,540 --> 00:44:54,820
I'm thinking about baseball needs of that sauce.

1064
00:44:54,820 --> 00:44:55,540
What's it need?

1065
00:44:55,540 --> 00:44:55,940
Yeah.

1066
00:44:55,940 --> 00:44:57,460
It needs a little bit of that sauce.

1067
00:44:57,460 --> 00:45:02,820
And I think having some other sort of excitement on top of baseball is the secret.

1068
00:45:02,820 --> 00:45:03,540
I got a good one.

1069
00:45:03,540 --> 00:45:04,040
Okay.

1070
00:45:04,040 --> 00:45:08,680
So, shot put and curling.

1071
00:45:08,680 --> 00:45:09,180
Ooh.

1072
00:45:09,960 --> 00:45:10,760
No, wait.

1073
00:45:10,760 --> 00:45:11,800
Yes, no.

1074
00:45:11,800 --> 00:45:12,920
Yes, I got it.

1075
00:45:12,920 --> 00:45:14,520
Discus and curling.

1076
00:45:15,080 --> 00:45:17,240
So you're doing your curling, right?

1077
00:45:18,120 --> 00:45:20,280
And you're scooting the thing down the pipe.

1078
00:45:20,280 --> 00:45:30,200
And then at any moment, someone could come scoop up your disc and hurl it as far as they can.

1079
00:45:30,200 --> 00:45:33,320
And then your sport has stopped and their sport has begun.

1080
00:45:33,320 --> 00:45:37,960
So you have to get it over across before someone can storm out of the darkness

1081
00:45:37,960 --> 00:45:40,680
and take your disc and throw it as far as they can.

1082
00:45:40,680 --> 00:45:41,180
Okay.

1083
00:45:41,180 --> 00:45:41,960
That's neat.

1084
00:45:41,960 --> 00:45:42,760
That's a neat idea.

1085
00:45:42,760 --> 00:45:45,400
In fact, shot put plus anything is very good.

1086
00:45:45,400 --> 00:45:45,880
That is true.

1087
00:45:45,880 --> 00:45:49,080
Like you could be playing football and you're like holding the ball,

1088
00:45:49,080 --> 00:45:51,960
but you better pass it quick or else someone's gonna,

1089
00:45:51,960 --> 00:45:56,440
a strong person's gonna run out of the shadows and grab it as far as they can.

1090
00:45:56,440 --> 00:45:57,800
And it won't be in a way you like.

1091
00:45:57,800 --> 00:46:02,360
I am pretty sure American football is soccer plus shot put, right?

1092
00:46:02,360 --> 00:46:03,080
Yeah, I'm pretty sure.

1093
00:46:03,080 --> 00:46:04,520
I'm gonna kick the ball.

1094
00:46:04,520 --> 00:46:06,760
No, wait, that guy grabbed it and threw it.

1095
00:46:06,760 --> 00:46:09,560
There's always just big fellas trying to take the ball away from you.

1096
00:46:09,560 --> 00:46:10,840
That's sort of like inherent.

1097
00:46:10,840 --> 00:46:13,080
That's like an important facet of the sport.

1098
00:46:13,080 --> 00:46:13,720
What about?

1099
00:46:13,720 --> 00:46:14,840
I got a great one.

1100
00:46:14,840 --> 00:46:15,480
Okay.

1101
00:46:15,480 --> 00:46:22,760
What about cross country skiing and rifle shooting?

1102
00:46:23,400 --> 00:46:26,520
Oh, is this the most dangerous game kind of thing?

1103
00:46:27,160 --> 00:46:28,760
No, you wouldn't be shooting at each other.

1104
00:46:28,760 --> 00:46:33,240
You would cross country ski for a while and go for a long time.

1105
00:46:33,240 --> 00:46:37,640
And so you're kind of racing like that, but then you get to like a target range

1106
00:46:37,640 --> 00:46:40,280
where then you have to shoot a bunch of targets with your rifle.

1107
00:46:41,080 --> 00:46:43,560
And then you set it down and you just keep on skiing, baby.

1108
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:49,080
Okay, so what's the addition here?

1109
00:46:49,960 --> 00:46:50,840
What do you mean?

1110
00:46:50,840 --> 00:46:52,680
Like how is this improving both sports?

1111
00:46:52,680 --> 00:46:57,320
Um, cause you're watching people cross country ski and then you're like,

1112
00:46:57,320 --> 00:46:58,680
this is getting boring.

1113
00:46:58,680 --> 00:46:59,960
Whoa, what are they doing?

1114
00:46:59,960 --> 00:47:01,560
And then they get out a rifle and they're like,

1115
00:47:01,560 --> 00:47:06,200
Now there is downhill skiing with lasers, right?

1116
00:47:08,680 --> 00:47:09,800
I'm doing a joke.

1117
00:47:10,680 --> 00:47:11,720
You fucking guys.

1118
00:47:11,720 --> 00:47:14,120
I'm doing a joke because it's called the biathlon.

1119
00:47:14,120 --> 00:47:15,000
It's a thing that exists.

1120
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:17,720
But you weren't even, sometimes I do fucking,

1121
00:47:17,720 --> 00:47:19,800
sometimes I do a fucking joke on this show.

1122
00:47:19,800 --> 00:47:22,920
And it like doesn't work because you guys don't get it.

1123
00:47:23,480 --> 00:47:25,320
Jokes interesting jokes and interesting.

1124
00:47:25,320 --> 00:47:26,520
It makes me pretty pissed.

1125
00:47:26,520 --> 00:47:29,400
It makes me pretty pissed off if I'm being honest.

1126
00:47:29,400 --> 00:47:30,200
Oh no, wait, I've got it.

1127
00:47:30,200 --> 00:47:32,840
Wait, before we go on baseball and ballroom dancing.

1128
00:47:32,840 --> 00:47:37,960
You catch the ball and then you have to do a little dance and you get judged on it.

1129
00:47:37,960 --> 00:47:41,400
And you hit the ball and you have to do a little dance before you can run.

1130
00:47:41,400 --> 00:47:45,720
Or you do the dance while you're running and you got a samba to the first base.

1131
00:47:45,720 --> 00:47:47,320
You got a rumba to second base.

1132
00:47:47,320 --> 00:47:53,000
You got a tango to third.

1133
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:54,040
I want to munch.

1134
00:47:54,040 --> 00:47:54,540
Squad.

1135
00:47:57,080 --> 00:47:59,160
I want to munch.

1136
00:47:59,160 --> 00:47:59,660
Squad.

1137
00:48:02,680 --> 00:48:03,320
Welcome to Munch Squad.

1138
00:48:03,320 --> 00:48:06,200
It's a podcast within a podcast about the latest and greatest of brand eating.

1139
00:48:06,200 --> 00:48:06,680
I'm going to-

1140
00:48:06,680 --> 00:48:08,600
Did you say brain eating?

1141
00:48:08,600 --> 00:48:09,320
Brand eating.

1142
00:48:09,320 --> 00:48:14,600
I'm trying to do more headlines right now because there's not as many deep dives,

1143
00:48:14,600 --> 00:48:16,840
but there are some things that I do want to pass on.

1144
00:48:16,840 --> 00:48:17,240
Okay.

1145
00:48:17,240 --> 00:48:17,640
To you.

1146
00:48:17,640 --> 00:48:20,040
Wienerschnitzel is a chain-

1147
00:48:20,040 --> 00:48:21,240
You taste it right from that mouth?

1148
00:48:21,880 --> 00:48:27,000
Wienerschnitzel announces lineup for new cheesy Oozefest.

1149
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:29,320
Oh fuck, Wienerschnitzel.

1150
00:48:29,320 --> 00:48:30,520
Steal yourself.

1151
00:48:30,520 --> 00:48:34,600
Oozefest has arrived at Wienerschnitzel and it's going to be epic.

1152
00:48:35,240 --> 00:48:39,400
Experience unsurpassed deliciousness with the chain's new cheese sauce

1153
00:48:39,400 --> 00:48:41,880
taking the spotlight of three fan favorites.

1154
00:48:41,880 --> 00:48:48,440
It later said, it says in the quote, and this is from the CMO of Wienerschnitzel,

1155
00:48:48,440 --> 00:48:51,480
Doug Kokobohen,

1156
00:48:52,440 --> 00:48:56,280
we're confident our Oozefest event will be a big hit.

1157
00:48:57,080 --> 00:49:00,440
If you like cheese, you're going to love these.

1158
00:49:01,880 --> 00:49:04,760
After one bite, you'll be requesting an encore.

1159
00:49:04,760 --> 00:49:05,800
Oh God.

1160
00:49:05,800 --> 00:49:08,920
I assume after this he said, are any of those anything?

1161
00:49:08,920 --> 00:49:10,360
I have other things to do.

1162
00:49:10,360 --> 00:49:14,520
Other things to do, and the press release says, no need to trek to a desert

1163
00:49:14,520 --> 00:49:17,160
to experience these amazing headliners.

1164
00:49:17,160 --> 00:49:19,240
That possibility had not occurred to me, Wienerschnitzel.

1165
00:49:19,240 --> 00:49:21,480
Why would I go there, Wienerschnitzel?

1166
00:49:21,480 --> 00:49:24,840
Because this tasty trio will be touring your nearest Wienerschnitzel,

1167
00:49:24,840 --> 00:49:25,960
but for a limited time only.

1168
00:49:25,960 --> 00:49:28,120
Where did the desert come from?

1169
00:49:28,120 --> 00:49:29,400
I guess it's a Burning Man thing.

1170
00:49:29,400 --> 00:49:30,360
What's the desert?

1171
00:49:30,360 --> 00:49:32,840
That's the festival that Wienerschnitzel has heard about.

1172
00:49:32,840 --> 00:49:36,440
Hey Justin, is it E-W-W-S?

1173
00:49:36,440 --> 00:49:38,120
Ooze?

1174
00:49:38,120 --> 00:49:39,080
Fucking got him.

1175
00:49:39,080 --> 00:49:42,200
This is a very brief one because it's just a sad story, but I do.

1176
00:49:42,200 --> 00:49:44,760
This is in the general actual news category.

1177
00:49:46,280 --> 00:49:53,720
Taco Bell was not done with their absolutely like slash and burn crusade

1178
00:49:53,720 --> 00:49:55,640
against their own shit.

1179
00:49:55,640 --> 00:49:57,800
Their scorched earth policy?

1180
00:49:57,800 --> 00:50:01,400
Yeah, the final revamp of 2020.

1181
00:50:01,400 --> 00:50:03,000
We're just doing empty shells.

1182
00:50:03,560 --> 00:50:04,920
No, they're getting rid of...

1183
00:50:04,920 --> 00:50:09,960
They're getting rid of Mexican pizza.

1184
00:50:09,960 --> 00:50:10,460
No!

1185
00:50:11,960 --> 00:50:19,480
One of the more authentic dishes at Taco Bell.

1186
00:50:19,480 --> 00:50:24,520
They're getting rid of Mexican pizza, they're getting rid of pico de gallo,

1187
00:50:24,520 --> 00:50:26,280
and they're getting rid of shredded chicken.

1188
00:50:26,920 --> 00:50:30,040
Now if you say you want chicken, you won't be able to specify

1189
00:50:30,600 --> 00:50:32,280
that you want that shit shredded.

1190
00:50:32,280 --> 00:50:37,080
Uh, you're gonna just only have one style of chicken.

1191
00:50:37,080 --> 00:50:37,580
Huh.

1192
00:50:38,440 --> 00:50:39,160
Wow.

1193
00:50:39,160 --> 00:50:43,560
Removing, um, this is actually gonna trip you out pretty bad.

1194
00:50:44,840 --> 00:50:50,120
Taco Bell said removing Mexican pizza will help it leave a lighter footprint

1195
00:50:50,680 --> 00:50:58,360
since the Mexican pizza's packaging accounts for more than seven million pounds

1196
00:50:58,360 --> 00:51:01,800
of paperboard material per year in the US.

1197
00:51:01,800 --> 00:51:04,680
Are you fucking with shit right now?

1198
00:51:04,680 --> 00:51:06,920
We're crazy for this pizza.

1199
00:51:07,480 --> 00:51:07,980
What?

1200
00:51:08,840 --> 00:51:15,160
I want to see a graph now which is like human waste of all year

1201
00:51:15,160 --> 00:51:19,320
and then one sliver of it is like a not inconsiderable portion

1202
00:51:19,320 --> 00:51:21,400
is Mexican pizza packaging.

1203
00:51:21,400 --> 00:51:21,900
Wow.

1204
00:51:22,760 --> 00:51:24,200
So that's mind-blowing.

1205
00:51:24,200 --> 00:51:27,640
And our last story, rest in peace shredded chicken,

1206
00:51:27,640 --> 00:51:32,120
our last story comes to us from the Hershey Company.

1207
00:51:32,120 --> 00:51:36,200
The Reese's brand, the Reese's brand is here to save your morning

1208
00:51:36,200 --> 00:51:38,360
with the new Reese's snack cakes.

1209
00:51:38,360 --> 00:51:44,760
A first of its kind mid-morning cake treat by the Reese's brand you love.

1210
00:51:45,560 --> 00:51:46,600
You read that right.

1211
00:51:47,400 --> 00:51:53,080
A Reese's treat to enjoy in the morning forever.

1212
00:51:54,280 --> 00:51:55,320
That's what it says.

1213
00:51:55,320 --> 00:51:56,120
It says forever?

1214
00:51:56,120 --> 00:51:58,120
Yep, you read that right.

1215
00:51:58,120 --> 00:52:01,720
A Reese's treat to enjoy in the morning forever.

1216
00:52:01,720 --> 00:52:04,600
Does that just mean like this is not a limited time thing, friends?

1217
00:52:04,600 --> 00:52:05,640
This is call shot.

1218
00:52:05,640 --> 00:52:06,140
Forever.

1219
00:52:06,760 --> 00:52:08,280
What is a morning cake?

1220
00:52:08,280 --> 00:52:16,040
Research shows 83% say they have indulged in dessert before noon in the past month.

1221
00:52:16,920 --> 00:52:22,600
Hey Reese's, can you think of any other fucking reason that might be?

1222
00:52:23,640 --> 00:52:24,680
You absolutely.

1223
00:52:24,680 --> 00:52:27,000
The Colonel is like, no, no, no, careful.

1224
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:27,560
No, no, no.

1225
00:52:27,560 --> 00:52:28,520
It's the COVID thing.

1226
00:52:28,520 --> 00:52:31,880
I know I ignored it for six months too before I changed finger looking good.

1227
00:52:31,880 --> 00:52:32,760
It's the COVID thing.

1228
00:52:32,760 --> 00:52:33,880
You're wandering right into it.

1229
00:52:35,080 --> 00:52:36,920
So we had a crazy idea.

1230
00:52:37,800 --> 00:52:44,280
Give Reese's fans permission to have cake as a mid-morning snack whenever they want.

1231
00:52:44,280 --> 00:52:51,960
So Reese's sees us at the bottom of the well in a deep global depression.

1232
00:52:51,960 --> 00:52:57,080
Uh-huh and rather than extend ahead and down to us to help us swim out,

1233
00:52:57,080 --> 00:53:00,440
it just starts dumping peanut butter and cake onto us.

1234
00:53:00,440 --> 00:53:02,200
Like here, we'll help you.

1235
00:53:02,200 --> 00:53:03,080
This is helping.

1236
00:53:03,800 --> 00:53:04,280
I'm helping.

1237
00:53:04,280 --> 00:53:05,080
Here's a shovel.

1238
00:53:05,080 --> 00:53:07,080
Dig down, dig down.

1239
00:53:07,080 --> 00:53:11,160
There's gotta be something better with Reese's snack cakes.

1240
00:53:11,160 --> 00:53:16,600
Reese's fans can enjoy a delicious combination of chocolate and peanut butter cream

1241
00:53:16,600 --> 00:53:18,680
without having to wait until lunch.

1242
00:53:18,680 --> 00:53:24,200
We wanted to create the perfect treat for Reese's fans to satisfy that mid-morning sweet tooth,

1243
00:53:25,080 --> 00:53:27,640
said Mike Orr, Snacks Brand Manager.

1244
00:53:27,640 --> 00:53:31,080
We know sometimes you just don't want to wait until lunch.

1245
00:53:31,080 --> 00:53:33,160
That's how Reese's snack cakes were born.

1246
00:53:35,160 --> 00:53:40,680
It's like the Reese's brand first ever mid-morning treat offers real milk chocolate

1247
00:53:40,680 --> 00:53:45,960
Reese's peanut butter cream in a two cake pack available December 2020

1248
00:53:45,960 --> 00:53:48,760
at convenience stores nationwide.

1249
00:53:50,760 --> 00:53:54,840
Now you can indulge in a Reese's treat any time of day.

1250
00:53:54,840 --> 00:53:57,160
Consider morning officially saved.

1251
00:53:57,160 --> 00:53:58,760
Hashtag not sorry.

1252
00:53:58,760 --> 00:54:00,200
Okay, first of all.

1253
00:54:00,200 --> 00:54:00,600
Yeah.

1254
00:54:00,600 --> 00:54:01,640
That put it a lot.

1255
00:54:01,640 --> 00:54:02,600
That was over the top.

1256
00:54:02,600 --> 00:54:04,040
The hashtag was over the top.

1257
00:54:04,040 --> 00:54:04,840
It's a lot.

1258
00:54:04,840 --> 00:54:09,320
What was stopping me from eating a Reese's cup in the morning?

1259
00:54:09,320 --> 00:54:13,640
That's fucking clearly nothing because according to your own fucking research,

1260
00:54:13,640 --> 00:54:17,080
83% of us are enjoying a little mid-morning.

1261
00:54:17,080 --> 00:54:18,040
So yeah.

1262
00:54:18,040 --> 00:54:23,480
So why is now making it a little breadier make it okay for me to do?

1263
00:54:24,120 --> 00:54:24,440
Yeah.

1264
00:54:24,440 --> 00:54:27,160
And y'all like, listen, you're not looking at these cakes.

1265
00:54:27,160 --> 00:54:28,280
They're cakes.

1266
00:54:28,280 --> 00:54:32,120
You're not making, this is not like a fucking biscotti.

1267
00:54:32,120 --> 00:54:36,040
It's like a layer of cake wrapped in chocolate with Reese's on it.

1268
00:54:36,040 --> 00:54:37,720
It's a dessert.

1269
00:54:37,720 --> 00:54:41,480
And you're just saying that you can eat it at 10 o'clock in the morning.

1270
00:54:41,480 --> 00:54:42,680
That doesn't do anything.

1271
00:54:42,680 --> 00:54:44,280
We give you permission.

1272
00:54:44,280 --> 00:54:45,240
Oh, I didn't.

1273
00:54:45,240 --> 00:54:50,120
I clearly didn't need it when 83% of me was already doing it.

1274
00:54:50,120 --> 00:54:52,520
Do you think that 17% was waiting on cake?

1275
00:54:53,560 --> 00:54:54,680
They're just waiting for it.

1276
00:54:54,680 --> 00:54:58,920
I'd love to eat a Reese's right now, but 17% of us say it's no good.

1277
00:54:58,920 --> 00:55:02,120
Maybe those 17% will be swayed by cake.

1278
00:55:02,120 --> 00:55:02,440
Possibly.

1279
00:55:02,440 --> 00:55:03,320
Perhaps if cake.

1280
00:55:04,760 --> 00:55:05,960
That's why I do want it though.

1281
00:55:05,960 --> 00:55:06,840
I want it.

1282
00:55:06,840 --> 00:55:07,560
I want to eat.

1283
00:55:07,560 --> 00:55:09,160
I'm so hungry looking at it.

1284
00:55:09,160 --> 00:55:10,120
You have no idea.

1285
00:55:10,120 --> 00:55:11,880
I would do anything to eat this cake right now.

1286
00:55:11,880 --> 00:55:15,240
I'm going to time travel to December 2020 when it's done so I can eat it.

1287
00:55:15,240 --> 00:55:15,560
But you know what?

1288
00:55:15,560 --> 00:55:18,120
It's 1.39 and maybe the vaccine too.

1289
00:55:18,120 --> 00:55:18,840
You don't know.

1290
00:55:18,840 --> 00:55:22,280
We might be having celebratory Reese's snack cakes with a delicious vaccine.

1291
00:55:22,280 --> 00:55:23,000
All right, Justin.

1292
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:23,960
You can only have one.

1293
00:55:23,960 --> 00:55:24,920
December 2020.

1294
00:55:24,920 --> 00:55:25,640
What do you pick?

1295
00:55:25,640 --> 00:55:27,800
Oh, the cake for sure.

1296
00:55:27,800 --> 00:55:29,080
Because the cake might fix.

1297
00:55:29,080 --> 00:55:31,720
The cake, we don't know the cake won't fix.

1298
00:55:32,600 --> 00:55:33,880
Yeah, that's true.

1299
00:55:33,880 --> 00:55:36,440
The cake definitely isn't a hoax.

1300
00:55:36,440 --> 00:55:36,760
Yeah.

1301
00:55:36,760 --> 00:55:37,800
Let's just leave it at that.

1302
00:55:37,800 --> 00:55:38,520
Jeez.

1303
00:55:38,520 --> 00:55:39,080
Oh, boy.

1304
00:55:39,640 --> 00:55:40,440
Oh, golly.

1305
00:55:40,440 --> 00:55:43,560
I will also wait until Reese's gives me permission to get a vaccine.

1306
00:55:45,160 --> 00:55:49,000
But 83% of you are getting mid-morning vaccines.

1307
00:55:49,960 --> 00:55:53,240
I'm just waiting for the Reese's scientists to determine that it's safe.

1308
00:55:53,240 --> 00:55:57,720
Just so you know, Justin, in the future, if you do bring Wienerschnitzel into the Munch Squad,

1309
00:55:57,720 --> 00:56:00,200
I am going to go because I did now.

1310
00:56:00,200 --> 00:56:02,120
I was in my hole for a while.

1311
00:56:02,120 --> 00:56:07,080
Whenever anybody brings up Wienerschnitzel, I climb into my hole that exists in my fucking

1312
00:56:07,080 --> 00:56:14,040
mind palace is a rage hole because Wienerschnitzel is a hot dog restaurant.

1313
00:56:14,040 --> 00:56:17,960
And Wienerschnitzel is not a hot dog.

1314
00:56:17,960 --> 00:56:19,480
It is a breaded veal cutlet.

1315
00:56:20,120 --> 00:56:25,000
And the guy that started Wienerschnitzel was like, I need a name for my hot dog place.

1316
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:30,280
And he was looking in one of his wife's recipe books and saw Wienerschnitzel in there.

1317
00:56:30,280 --> 00:56:31,960
He's like, that's a great name.

1318
00:56:32,520 --> 00:56:34,120
Got Wiener right there, doesn't it?

1319
00:56:34,120 --> 00:56:35,480
It's got Wiener right there in it.

1320
00:56:35,480 --> 00:56:39,000
And I hope his wife was like, oh, John, stop.

1321
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:40,200
Look at the picture, John.

1322
00:56:40,760 --> 00:56:43,320
I wish you were a more attentive reader and lover.

1323
00:56:44,360 --> 00:56:50,040
He said, when you started the restaurant, quote, no one wanted to call their company

1324
00:56:50,040 --> 00:56:50,920
Wienerschnitzel.

1325
00:56:50,920 --> 00:56:53,800
Three days later, I said, hell, it's better than John's hot dogs.

1326
00:56:53,800 --> 00:56:54,440
No, it's not.

1327
00:56:54,440 --> 00:56:55,240
It's not?

1328
00:56:55,240 --> 00:56:55,800
It's not.

1329
00:56:55,800 --> 00:56:56,760
And you know why, John?

1330
00:56:57,400 --> 00:57:00,040
Because John's hot dogs has hot dogs in it.

1331
00:57:00,040 --> 00:57:04,600
And I'm pretty sure Nathan's Famous Hot Dogs is a very popular brand.

1332
00:57:04,600 --> 00:57:08,920
Yep, it's not Nathan's Famous Sushi that sells hot dogs.

1333
00:57:09,640 --> 00:57:10,760
They got the name right.

1334
00:57:10,760 --> 00:57:11,960
It has the right food in it.

1335
00:57:13,080 --> 00:57:17,240
Anyway, apparently they sold Wienerschnitzel for a few months in 2017.

1336
00:57:17,240 --> 00:57:19,240
I assume that was just to get me off their case.

1337
00:57:20,360 --> 00:57:20,840
Did it work?

1338
00:57:21,560 --> 00:57:21,800
Nope.

1339
00:57:22,440 --> 00:57:23,960
He could see right through it.

1340
00:57:23,960 --> 00:57:25,480
Hey, guys, be quiet for 30 seconds.

1341
00:57:25,480 --> 00:57:25,960
Can you do that?

1342
00:57:25,960 --> 00:57:26,280
Sure.

1343
00:57:28,440 --> 00:57:29,160
Here you go.

1344
00:57:29,160 --> 00:57:32,920
Double cheese fries, double cheese chili fries, and a double cheese chili dog.

1345
00:57:32,920 --> 00:57:33,720
Enjoy.

1346
00:57:33,720 --> 00:57:34,360
Wow.

1347
00:57:34,360 --> 00:57:36,840
Everyone seems to love a ooze fest event.

1348
00:57:36,840 --> 00:57:39,160
Yeah, we are actually running low on cheese sauce.

1349
00:57:39,880 --> 00:57:41,160
Weird, I just made a bunch.

1350
00:57:42,920 --> 00:57:43,800
I'll go check it out.

1351
00:57:46,040 --> 00:57:48,120
Oh, that explains it.

1352
00:57:50,760 --> 00:57:51,480
Cool.

1353
00:57:51,480 --> 00:57:57,080
At this point, I should just pause real quick to say that there's a person in a giant hot dog suit

1354
00:57:57,800 --> 00:58:03,400
and they've got a jacuzzi tub filled with cheese sauce and they're ladling more into it.

1355
00:58:03,400 --> 00:58:04,040
Okay.

1356
00:58:04,040 --> 00:58:07,000
And they're about to climb into it and they're wearing a towel

1357
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:08,520
because they're about to get into the cheese sauce.

1358
00:58:08,520 --> 00:58:10,600
I'm glad you broke that down for us because I was confused.

1359
00:58:11,720 --> 00:58:12,360
Floaties.

1360
00:58:14,280 --> 00:58:18,280
The towel has dropped from the hot dog while this young man looks on.

1361
00:58:19,640 --> 00:58:23,240
Dive into all the new cheesy goodness during ooze fest at Wienerschnitzel.

1362
00:58:24,440 --> 00:58:24,680
So-

1363
00:58:24,680 --> 00:58:26,680
Do they reference the hot dog's genitals?

1364
00:58:26,680 --> 00:58:28,440
Do they say, does the dude like-

1365
00:58:28,440 --> 00:58:30,920
Wouldn't it be amazing if it had another smaller hot dog?

1366
00:58:30,920 --> 00:58:32,760
I mean, that's what it has to be, Justin.

1367
00:58:32,760 --> 00:58:33,880
Has to be, has to be.

1368
00:58:33,880 --> 00:58:34,280
Has to be.

1369
00:58:34,280 --> 00:58:35,080
Thank you for listening.

1370
00:58:35,080 --> 00:58:41,640
The employee pushes his sunglasses down the bridge of his nose like, oh yeah.

1371
00:58:41,640 --> 00:58:42,920
Thank you for listening to My Brother.

1372
00:58:43,480 --> 00:58:45,960
You don't work there if you don't find hot dogs sexy.

1373
00:58:45,960 --> 00:58:47,160
Thanks for listening to-

1374
00:58:47,960 --> 00:58:52,120
I would actually think you can't work there without later finding-

1375
00:58:52,120 --> 00:58:54,440
Like you just handle them so much.

1376
00:58:54,440 --> 00:58:55,880
It's going to creep its way into your brain.

1377
00:58:55,880 --> 00:58:57,560
Let this end.

1378
00:58:57,560 --> 00:59:00,120
This has been My Brother, My Brother Meets and My Show for the Modern Era.

1379
00:59:00,120 --> 00:59:01,320
Thank you so much for listening.

1380
00:59:01,320 --> 00:59:04,680
We so appreciate you being here.

1381
00:59:04,680 --> 00:59:09,560
We, it's new month, which means there's some new merchandise in our store.

1382
00:59:09,560 --> 00:59:11,720
Including those bee pins.

1383
00:59:11,720 --> 00:59:13,160
We got hilarious bee pins back-

1384
00:59:13,160 --> 00:59:14,040
Throw those out.

1385
00:59:14,040 --> 00:59:15,400
Fuck those again.

1386
00:59:15,400 --> 00:59:15,960
So funny.

1387
00:59:18,360 --> 00:59:20,280
And so go check that out.

1388
00:59:20,280 --> 00:59:21,560
And also you can pre-order our book.

1389
00:59:21,560 --> 00:59:21,800
Yeah.

1390
00:59:23,160 --> 00:59:24,680
It's there for sale.

1391
00:59:24,680 --> 00:59:25,880
It's at Amazon or-

You'll like it.

1400
00:59:43,240 --> 00:59:46,360
It's got jokes in it and games for the kids.

1401
00:59:46,360 --> 00:59:47,080
Doesn't have games.

1402
00:59:47,720 --> 00:59:50,440
Thanks to John Roderick and the Long Winters for using our theme song.

1403
00:59:50,920 --> 00:59:53,240
It's a departure off the album, Putting the Days to Bed.

1404
00:59:54,840 --> 00:59:57,000

Oh, and check out The Besties if you haven't.

1411
01:00:11,240 --> 01:00:17,960
It's mine and Justin's favorite game podcast that we do with our buds, Russ and Chris.

1414
01:00:20,920 --> 01:00:22,920
The last episode we did was on a bunch of games.

1415
01:00:22,920 --> 01:00:23,640
It was a lot of fun.

1416
01:00:24,680 --> 01:00:25,400
You want the final?

1417
01:00:26,120 --> 01:00:26,680
Oh, yeah.

1418
01:00:26,680 --> 01:00:29,240
This final one was sent in by the wizard, Emma Cant.

1419
01:00:29,240 --> 01:00:29,720
Thank you, Emma.

1420
01:00:29,720 --> 01:00:33,720
It's a Yahoo Answers user, Brian, whose fucking profile picture

1421
01:00:33,720 --> 01:00:37,080
is a very intimidating close up of Santa Claus.

1422
01:00:37,880 --> 01:00:38,760
Like he's got this.

1423
01:00:38,760 --> 01:00:43,480
He actually has his little Santa Claus spectacles pushed down the bridge of his nose,

1424
01:00:43,480 --> 01:00:45,480
as if he's saying like, oh, yeah.

1425
01:00:46,360 --> 01:00:48,360
Yeah, I love that hot dog's wiener.

1426
01:00:49,320 --> 01:00:56,840
So Brian asks, can I order a Subway sandwich deconstructed?

1427
01:00:57,800 --> 01:00:58,760
My name is Justin.

1428
01:00:58,760 --> 01:01:00,120
I'm Travis McElroy.

1429
01:01:00,120 --> 01:01:02,120
We talk about Subway a lot, don't we?

1430
01:01:02,120 --> 01:01:03,000
They do salads.

1431
01:01:03,560 --> 01:01:05,000
This has been My Brother, My Brother, and Me.

1432
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:05,480
That's Griffin.

1433
01:01:05,480 --> 01:01:07,480
Kiss your dad, squirt on the lips.
