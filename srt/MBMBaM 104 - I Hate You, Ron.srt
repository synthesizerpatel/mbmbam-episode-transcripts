1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:30,800
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:50,080
Welcome to My Brother, My Brother, and Me, an advice show for the modern era. A historic

6
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:59,040
week indeed. We now live in a nation where our president, Barack Hussein Obama, has declared

7
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:09,440
everyone is gay. Yep. What's so funny, Travis? No, I'm just, I was so excited. That was the

8
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:16,320
laughter of excitement. It's a major sea change. His announcement was so monumental. I just like,

9
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:24,000
I turned, I turned to all my friends and I said, today we, we are all gay. And then we just like

10
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:31,600
started scooping it. Yeah. Bottoms up, if you know what I mean. I said, today's the day we celebrate

11
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:37,760
our independence, gay. It was so strange because I was in a room with a bunch of guys

12
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:46,320
and what was previously a comfortable gathering of bros hoisting and watching the news together,

13
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:53,680
there was suddenly like so many layers of sexual tension, you know? You just put all the dicks in

14
00:01:53,680 --> 00:02:00,640
the middle, made a dick octopus. You were in a news bar? I was in a news bar. No. Travis, I was

15
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:09,200
having my, my Thursday afternoon, just news hoist, just a bunch of bros hoisting a few brews and

16
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:13,680
watching the news. Brews and news, I call it. Brews and news. Yeah. Brews and news, I call it.

17
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:16,400
You do it after legs and eggs at the landing strip.

18
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:24,240
Uh, so welcome to the first episode of My Brother, My Brother, Me that is completely

19
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:30,240
a hundred percent, uh, uh, gay. I'm your oldest and by extension gayest brother,

20
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:34,640
Justin McElroy. Is that how that works? I'm the middle-est and gayest brother.

21
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:44,080
I'm Griffin McElroy. I'm your youngest brother and, um, it's Adam and Eve, you guys. Yeah.

22
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:50,560
Whoa. I didn't get, I didn't get hit. You're a federal outlaw now. I'm in the middle of Texas.

23
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:55,920
The wave didn't reach me here. The sonar pulse that he sent out.

24
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:04,880
It sounded, it sounded, it sounded exactly like a DeBarge record, which I thought was very strange.

25
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:09,760
You just feel to the beat of the rhythm of the night, just pulsing throughout the entire country

26
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:15,360
and it just flipped. I thought I heard, I had my windows down, but again, I'm so far away.

27
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:20,080
I thought I heard all things just keep getting better by a wildlife. Like I thought I heard

28
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:24,240
wildlife. I thought I heard the wildlife wave crash against Austin shores, but

29
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:30,560
didn't make it through Hill country. Yeah. Too much obstruction. Uh, yeah. Griffin. Yeah.

30
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:34,960
It didn't get all the way. The only effects there is Griffin is dressing really well now.

31
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:40,320
That's the only thing. Oh, I look great. He looks fantastic. You're fit. Uh, tan looks,

32
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:45,760
looks great. Uh, just prefers ladies still. Uh, so why don't you guys go over to,

33
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:49,200
why don't you guys go listen to throwing shade? They're going to, they're probably going to have

34
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:53,120
a lot more informed opinion. They're probably going to sound a lot more informed, probably

35
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:58,560
going to sound a lot less stupid when they talk about this thing. Congratulations. Congratulations.

36
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:03,920
Just everyone. Yeah. Except for, except for people who hate, uh, homosexuals and anybody

37
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:12,640
sort of anti LGBT. Um, in which case go fuck off. Yeah. You suck. Yeah. And I say that now

38
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:19,840
deep down or the conviction of a man living a gay life and I, I'm, and I, I now hate those people.

39
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:24,400
I don't think you know what, I don't think, you know, a gay means cause I don't like you're

40
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:30,240
married to a woman. Yeah. I'm pretty sure that you, that you, that presumably you love it's a

41
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:34,720
federal law. Griffin. I'm not, I'm not going to throw it in the face of the authorities and say

42
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:39,280
that I'm straight president. Doesn't just like come out and say stuff like this on a whim.

43
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:44,960
Right. That's true. He did polling research. He signed things. Things were signed. Yeah. Yeah.

44
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:49,520
There's, there's significant policy coming, but nope. There's, but there's, oh, there's not.

45
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:54,640
Nevermind. Next, next question. First question. The president did polling research that I wanted

46
00:04:54,640 --> 00:05:00,640
to research polls. He knows, he knows what's up. He called up, he called up Joey Lucas. He's like,

47
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:08,560
Hey, how do we feel about gays today? We cool. Am I good? Joey, are you there? Hello?

48
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:14,080
Oh, you're fictional. Fuck. Unpredictably the president, the president's gay polarity beam

49
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:20,240
actually gave her her hearing back. So yeah, it's a big day for her. Hey, that was the first episode

50
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:27,040
of season eight. God damn it. God damn it. Obama winter little lies. Okay. In a relationship,

51
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:32,160
my husband is very loosey goosey when it comes to adhering to best before dates and hates wasting

52
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:38,160
food. Sometimes when he's at work, I throw things away and tell him I ate it. Am I wrong?

53
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:44,800
Um, before we, before we address the bigger question here, your husband is right and you

54
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:48,800
are wrong. Best before dates are there for a reason. They wouldn't put that date on there.

55
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:53,200
If there wasn't something bad that happened after that date, you shouldn't keep it in the house.

56
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:57,440
No, no. Then, then she's right. Then you are right. And your husband is wrong. Yeah. Yeah.

57
00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:02,960
That's that's no, no. I sometimes just to be safe, I'll go like three days before.

58
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:07,680
No way. It's not an exact science. There's no way they can pinpoint that day. If so,

59
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:13,520
they're precogs. That's a bigger problem. Your systems, your system needs that bad stuff,

60
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:18,000
trying to hurt it or else it's going to get like, it's like attachment parenting right now. What

61
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,840
you guys are doing is attachment parenting for your immune systems. Justin, why would they put

62
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:26,320
a best before date if it wasn't bad after that day? I'm sorry, Travis. Are you going to let,

63
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:31,440
they want you to go to the store and buy new stuff. Are you going to let big dairy tell you

64
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:37,120
when you can eat something or are you just going to eat it? You know, yes I am. In this circumstance,

65
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:41,200
big dairy, you're in control, big buddy. Your body knows when something is bad. If there's a

66
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:44,400
bubble in your tomato sauce. Yes, and you know what's important to my body? My eyes and my brain

67
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:49,440
that look at the best before date and my brain goes, you got it, bro. I have a carton of buttermilk

68
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:55,680
that I bought solely to make biscuits about a month ago and it is best before day is May 1st.

69
00:06:55,680 --> 00:07:00,240
I'm pretty sure if I crack that bad boy open, it's going to be dumplings. I'm afraid to look in it.

70
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:07,120
It made biscuits itself. No, that's right. I don't know. Like I'm afraid to touch

71
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:13,600
stuff once it's past the date, let alone consume it with my mouth. So, so a panel of three experts,

72
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:18,480
two against one. Travis and I win. Fair enough. The second issue though, is that how do you want

73
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:25,040
your husband to look at you when he comes home from work and you're like, Hey, um, you remember

74
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:32,800
that like totally gnar hummus. Hey hon, I ate all the ranch. You're like, I'm not sure if I should

75
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:39,920
eat the hummus cause it looks kind of gnar. It's got a face now. Like, yeah, I totally consumed it.

76
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:47,520
I don't even know how you bring it up in conversation. Hey hon, how was your day?

77
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:51,280
Oh, mine was pretty good. Just you grubbing on a bunch of rotten food.

78
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:58,000
I just ate like a tub of sour cream that did not begin a sour cream. Yeah, just grubbing on rotten

79
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:05,440
food like that makes you so proud. This is what I picture him coming home and going to throw

80
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:11,040
something away and opening the trashcan and it's just full of like salad dressing containers,

81
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:18,400
you know? And he's like, honey, what, what is the meaning of this? Yeah. Just slamming some Caesar.

82
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:24,640
Don't worry about it. I saw the thousand island and I just couldn't stop myself. I'm a growing lady.

83
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:30,000
I gotta, you know, your husband loves you. He shouldn't want you to eat rotten food.

84
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:34,640
Well, that's how you got to pitch it to him, right? So, so that he doesn't get upset. You

85
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:39,920
got to say, listen, I knew you were going to eat that totally gnar hummus with a face. Like,

86
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:44,960
I knew that when you got home from work, you were going to take your coat off. You're going to say,

87
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:49,200
hi honey, and smooch me on the cheek. And then you were going to go dip into that gnar hummus

88
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:52,960
and I didn't want you to hurt yourself. So I jumped on that grenade for you.

89
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:57,920
I think that's the answer to the question of when are little lies okay for their own protection?

90
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:02,560
But then he's going to start thinking you're some sort of fucking superhero because you're like,

91
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:08,720
baby, that, that hummus had hair. Like, you ate it and you're totally fine. He's going to think

92
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:12,800
you're, you're a fucking Rasputin or something. What if you guys are ever locked in a prison

93
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:19,120
of rotten food? He's going to be like, well, no worries. That's your manna. You love that.

94
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:23,280
I know that's your jam is the rotten food and rotten man. Otherwise you've just been lying to

95
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:27,600
me all these years and I can't believe that because you love me so much. Don't lie to him.

96
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:32,880
Go straight to his face and say, uh, Hey Doug, if you cared so much about wasting food,

97
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:39,040
then you should have eaten that hummus before it got so rowdy. Like you, you owe it to me to not

98
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:46,400
have rotten food in our house. Just eat it all next time before the date. Just don't lie to him.

99
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:51,920
This is, this is one Oh one. You're trying to save him from eating rotten food. If you feel like this

100
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:59,200
is a moment for education, not deception, educate. If he's a grown ass man, he's had plenty of time

101
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:04,000
to break this habit and he hasn't, but some dudes are big dumb animals when it comes to this kind

102
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:08,080
of stuff. And it sounds like your, your husband is one of those kinds of people and that's fine.

103
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:15,200
Maybe you just got to let him get like really, really raunchy Ria. Let him like eat all the

104
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:21,280
totally rowdy hummus. Let him eat that meatloaf that you guys made six months ago. Let him eat

105
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:26,800
that wheel of cheese that it looks like the fucking Necronomicon. Like let him eat all of

106
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:34,240
that shit. And then when he gets totally blasted down there, when he almost dies from it and

107
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:39,200
claws his way back from the edge of death, just look at him and say, hmm, looks like we've learned

108
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:44,160
a little something here. Leave the lid off the trash can. And when he gets home to say, okay,

109
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:48,960
Doug, I put rotten food in our trash. If you love it so much, then you go over there and you eat

110
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:53,920
that trash food. You pull it out of the trash and you eat it. Pull it out of the trash like an animal

111
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:59,600
and you eat it. Get over there, raccoon Doug. Go to town. Otherwise go to Kroger and buy some new

112
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:05,200
hummus. Fuck. Here's two dollars. Go buy some fucking hummus, Doug. Two dollars. Now go replace

113
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:10,960
the eggs. I threw them away. They smelled like bacon. They were hatching. They were hatching.

114
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:18,000
And I don't want chicks in the house. Draw a line in the sand somewhere. Man,

115
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:22,400
the whole food thing was ruined for me by taking a food handling courses and watching like the

116
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:29,360
danger zone videos. Oh my God. Everything is the day. Unless your shit is like cryogenically vacuum

117
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:36,720
sealed. Yeah. It's, it's in the goddamn danger zone. It's like, if it's not above 120 or below

118
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:44,400
30 degrees, it's bad for you. It'll kill you. And it's at last that best by date is a pretty liberal.

119
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:50,080
Yeah. Your food, once you take it into the danger zone, you can't take it back out again. You,

120
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:55,200
you set off a timer and that time was like 15 minutes. And it was always like, oh,

121
00:11:55,200 --> 00:12:00,480
the food didn't touch the counter. Did it? Oh no. Danger zone. Yeah. Cause, because chicken,

122
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:06,880
raw chicken touched that counter once 12 years ago. And that's like, it was a night like this.

123
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:12,640
Yeah. Over 12 years ago. So that counters done. Got to get new counters. I had an odd experience

124
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:19,280
with expiration dates this week. My lady, my wife was, was craving some chocolate. So I said, hold

125
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:24,320
on. I got a secret. I got a secret bag of Lindor truffles that I keep for just such an occasion.

126
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:29,840
So I go get the bag of Lindor truffles and she like pops one in and it starts eating it. And

127
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:36,320
then she gets his weird look on her face and she picks up the bag and examine it. Apparently the

128
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:43,120
best buy date was in 2010. Oh no. So they were a little, you know that weird, like when the chocolate

129
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:47,760
gets white and you're like, oh man, I don't know what this is all about. So we go and we throw the

130
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:54,800
whole bag out. Uh, today I see that some of them has gotten into the trash and scattered around

131
00:12:54,800 --> 00:13:02,080
our trashcan is like 15 individual Lindor truffle wrappers. You're saying outside of your house,

132
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:08,960
not like Sydney snuck down and there was some raccoon sitting outside my house last night or

133
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:17,520
something. Oh, I shouldn't, but I will. Oh, it's going to go straight to my hips. I'll treat myself.

134
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:24,160
Oh, Michael, you ring tailed kook. You bastard. Those don't taste good. Trust me. I'm a human.

135
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:31,280
And I know, uh, Griffin, did we get a Yahoo's this week? We got several. I just want to just

136
00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:37,920
luxuriate in this mental picture of a raccoon sitting sort of Cheshire cat style. This legs

137
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:44,480
cross like, Oh hello. They must be right. They're rappers. He probably does the thing where like,

138
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:49,040
he puts it in his teeth and holds one end and like pulls it out. Oh yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It's

139
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:54,640
a definitely two raccoon operation. No, Bob, get over here. I need you to help me crack this.

140
00:13:54,640 --> 00:14:01,280
It just became twice as adorable. They opened my trashcan lid and left it all around. And

141
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:06,480
when Sydney and I went out this morning, the first words out of my fucking stupid mouth were,

142
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:13,040
you think you think it's a bear? Yeah, it's a bear. It's a bear that takes the lid off

143
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:23,200
your trashcan and individually opens. Yeah. It's blue. You just have a neighbor who saw you carrying

144
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:28,160
the trash out and saw like the Lindor bag trash bag. And they're like, I'm getting on that. If

145
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:33,840
they go to bed, I'm going to tear it up and make it look like a raccoon. That looks like a pretty

146
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:39,840
full bag of troubles. Crime. The perfect crime. The thing I steal is going to give me rock and

147
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:45,280
rea. It's the perfect crime next door neighbor. I don't see why you had to come out naked with

148
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:50,320
a tail tape to you and dark circles drawn around your eyes. That seems like a lot of verisimilitude,

149
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:55,600
a lot more than I needed. Just next time, just ask and I'll like give you the old ass,

150
00:14:55,600 --> 00:15:02,400
give you the old old candy. Yeah. Guys, this Yahoo answer was sent by Emily Wall. Thank you, Emily.

151
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:12,080
It's by Yahoo answers user Kaya who asks, does Ryan Gosling party? So I guess this is kind of

152
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:17,120
a complicated question because there are a lot of different angles here. Like does he like to party

153
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:23,440
and is down for whatever? Or does he just, or does he just do something like smoke weed slash cocaine

154
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:30,720
or maybe just smoke weed when he's tired? Please only answer if you really know. Oh my God.

155
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:37,360
First response from Ryan Gosling. Yeah, I'm down for whatever. Hey girl, let me get those digits.

156
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:39,360
I'm high right now. Why do you ask?

157
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:50,160
I, um, I have to imagine that Mr. Gosling can party. He probably, I think he has the capacity

158
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:54,640
to party whether he chooses to or not is the question. I bet he's really straight edge

159
00:15:54,640 --> 00:15:59,920
actually. Now that I think about it, he's got to stay fit. He was in a half Nelson and he was

160
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:05,680
played a drug addict teacher and I think he saw that and I bet he was like when he got into the

161
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:11,200
role and he got out of it, he was like, I can't, I can't mess with that shit anymore. You know,

162
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:17,440
that's beneath me. Yeah. I bet he goes to parties like parties that are way below him on the social

163
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:22,800
level just to like bring them up a notch, you know? And I bet he just stays for like 10 minutes.

164
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:28,320
Doesn't, doesn't drink total straight edge. Think of this baller move, right? Ryan Gosling

165
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:33,440
walks into like your fucking high school graduation party where you've all stolen beer

166
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:36,640
from your dad's liquor cabinet or whatever. And Ryan Gosling just walks in and everybody goes,

167
00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:40,000
Oh my God, is that Ryan Gosling? And he just looks around and goes, Oh, I can't believe

168
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:45,760
you guys are drinking. It's totally not cool. Straight edge for life. And then he leaves.

169
00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:53,520
And after that, what are we doing? Yeah. I, uh, I have, I've recently learned by recently,

170
00:16:53,520 --> 00:17:00,000
I mean the past minute and a half. Um, I don't think party means what it did when I was younger.

171
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:05,440
In my day, if somebody said a party, the only requirements were a, somebody turned up the jock

172
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:10,560
jam CD really loud. And B, the invitation said till question mark. Those are the two ingredients

173
00:17:10,560 --> 00:17:14,720
for a party. I don't think that that's what this person is talking about. Now, once you turn the

174
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:19,360
jock jams up really loud, crank them. I mean, crank those jocks. Once you crank the jocks,

175
00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:24,960
like what's the next step there? Because I'm envisioning you at a party that you're hosting,

176
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:31,360
you put in the jock jam CD, which volume, uh, jock jams volume for the one that, uh, has the,

177
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:38,640
we will rock you. We are the champions. Oh, slam a jam and ding dong. I imagine that the next step

178
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:43,920
Griffin is to open the front door and wait for people to arrive. It's basically like every party

179
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:51,360
you had before you, before alcohol, where you have 20 kids in a basement, jock jams going,

180
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:57,520
jock jams going fucking eating pizza and then everybody looks at each other and everybody looks

181
00:17:57,520 --> 00:18:01,760
at each other and says, I thought this was supposed to be fun. I don't get it. I've seen

182
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:06,720
my parents doing this for years. How are they making it so enjoyable? I don't understand.

183
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:14,080
Let's leave it 10. Um, so what does partying mean now? I think it's like doing drugs.

184
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:21,520
It's like drugs and that's not partying. That's falling asleep. Oh man. Travy. You are old.

185
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:29,440
I am old. It's like fun drugs. It's like party drugs and then you do them and then like sometimes

186
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:35,200
you rub up against someone. It's, I don't fully comprehend it either, but I've watched a lot of

187
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:43,360
party of five. What, what kind of fun drugs? Oh, you know, like uppers and downers and perkeys and

188
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:48,240
xana. I would say almost by just by the meaning of the word, I don't think downers are fun drugs.

189
00:18:49,040 --> 00:18:54,000
You take them with uppers and then you, you're just kind of normal. Okay. It's not a good way

190
00:18:54,000 --> 00:19:06,080
to spend your money. Shroomers, dippers, uh, leaves, uh, sweet dust, uh, uh, lady fingers.

191
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:15,040
That's not a real one. Uh, power, power powder, uh, gummy vitamins. Uh huh. Special lemonade,

192
00:19:15,040 --> 00:19:26,480
uh, regular lemonade, uh, ring pop dipped in cocaine, uh, needles, uh, bag, baggies, dimers,

193
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:36,240
uh, and that's all the drugs that there are. Big 25 H. H. H. I had a fun experience with Ryan

194
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:41,920
Gosling this week. I was playing the, uh, this is a brief diversion into video games, but I promise

195
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:49,360
it's worth it. Uh, I was playing the beta of the new dungeon crawler torchlight two and, uh, you

196
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:54,480
can only play that online. So I, I went into some strangers, uh, I had to pick some stranger's game

197
00:19:54,480 --> 00:20:02,000
to join, uh, so I myself could play by myself. Uh, and the game I joined was hosted by Ryan Gosling

198
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:06,080
was this gentleman. It was this gentleman's username was Ryan Gosling. So I said, okay,

199
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:12,720
that looks like a good game to join as any. So Ryan Gosling joins and he finds me,

200
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:17,840
he tracks me down in his game world and introduces himself as Ryan Gosling. I say,

201
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:24,560
okay, hello, pleasure. Uh, and then he and I proceed to adventure around for a while.

202
00:20:24,560 --> 00:20:31,280
And after every, we fought a large enemy, he would always compare it to a scene in a movie.

203
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:39,920
And it's literally like at, we would be like a, a large, uh, giant boss. And he would say,

204
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:43,840
God, look at this place. This reminds me of after I stomped on that guy's face and dry.

205
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:48,640
Now, Justin, I'm sure you've already thought about this, but is it possible

206
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:53,360
that that was Ryan Gosling? It was definitely Ryan Gosling.

207
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:57,520
I mean, it's definitely Ryan Gosling. The only thing that made hurt his credibility a little bit

208
00:20:57,520 --> 00:21:05,840
it was that he introduced me to his ferret named Zac Efron. And it occurred to me then

209
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:13,280
that if he could name a ferret Zac Efron, then maybe somebody else could name a character Ryan

210
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:18,800
Gosling that wasn't Ryan Gosling. So that, that's what, that's what kind of ruined the illusion for

211
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:26,960
me. Um, I bet that's what Ryan Gosling does with his time is he just plays online,

212
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:32,320
online dungeon caller role playing games and just like eats Xannies and does needles.

213
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:41,120
Hey, the HM is real hard. My friends and I are planning to go to a karaoke bar in the

214
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:45,280
near future. I want to participate and avoid being that guy who sits in the back refusing

215
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:49,760
to have any fun. There's a girl I like who's coming as well. So I wanted to know what song

216
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:58,480
we best to, and this is in quotes, sing. I love this metric. I have, go for it. I have a higher

217
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:07,760
voice, similar, but not nearly as good as Jason Mraz. If that helps. It doesn't. That's from

218
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:14,560
thunder waffle. Okay. First step, never compare yourself to Jason Mraz ever. Second, you gotta,

219
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:18,400
you gotta get a new karaoke name. I don't think thunder waffle is going to take you.

220
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:25,440
That's into step one that I can, that I can tell you, uh, get a, get a karaoke, uh,

221
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:34,640
nom de nom de nom de Mike. Uh, it's Justin. What was your karaoke name? My karaoke name

222
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:42,880
has been for the past decade and is still plenty back. What was yours? Uh, Jeff Pepsi

223
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:48,800
and mine was encyclopedia Brown. You gotta get a handle for your, for your, uh, for your

224
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:54,160
performing performance. Cause that allows you some distance. It lets you, when I inhabit the

225
00:22:54,160 --> 00:23:00,320
character of plenty pack, then I know it's a, it's a role that I'm playing. I, I, I'm

226
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:06,800
more in touch with the music now as far as song choice. I can help out there. Yeah. What you don't

227
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:12,480
want to do is go for what you think is the funny choice, right? Because you've got those guys who

228
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:18,480
get up and do, I would do anything for love, but they can't sing. And it's a really hard song to do.

229
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:23,040
Yeah. There's a lot of, there's a lot of wrong things you can do when you're picking a karaoke

230
00:23:23,040 --> 00:23:26,560
song. Like you can pick a song that you think is going to be funny. You can pick a song that you

231
00:23:26,560 --> 00:23:33,040
really like. Oh man. That's just going to be the worst for you. Like I did a bird house in your

232
00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:36,320
soul at a karaoke place once. I was like, Oh, that's like the best song that's ever been written

233
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:43,920
by anyone. Not a good karaoke song. The best karaoke choice I think is the song that is the

234
00:23:43,920 --> 00:23:52,880
song that you would claim to like ironically, but you actually deep, deep down like it. It's

235
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:58,240
going to seem like an ironic pick, like you're picking it as a goof, but it actually is pretty

236
00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:04,800
kick ass. Here's an example. Um, get out, get out of my dreams, get into my car. Oh, that's a good

237
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:09,520
one. That's a good one. We're like, that's all right. That seems like a funny choice, but man,

238
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:15,200
you get that four on the floor. Everybody's into it. You know, everybody's with you all night long

239
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:20,000
by Lionel Richie. Yeah. See, that's a good, that's a good jam. I like that. Oh man. We're just

240
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:25,280
doing Rocky horror. All the, all the bait he can handle for literally any Michael McDonald,

241
00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:34,400
Michael McDonald, like it's going to sound good no matter what. And it's also important.

242
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:38,240
Don't pick anything. That's a bummer. Like I know that that's pretty obvious,

243
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:41,760
but you get those people to get up there and they're performing for themselves and they're

244
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:46,400
ignoring the fact that it's like a bar full of people. And suddenly the whole evening drops down

245
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:52,880
to like a candlelit. They decide everybody hurts and now, and they're going to inflict it on,

246
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:59,920
on you. Um, this is with the song, everybody. Yeah. Exactly. Uh, I would caution you,

247
00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:06,800
you pick a song that you know, the words for cold, like you have to know every word to it.

248
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:11,840
You do not, you cannot rely on the screen because it might, it might fritz out. You might get

249
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:17,200
distracted. The words might have the wrong words on it. Yeah. That's bad. And you also don't want

250
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:21,680
to be like glued to the screen the whole time. You want to be able to kind of like do it. And

251
00:25:21,680 --> 00:25:26,320
in this world, there's smartphones that connect to YouTube. There's no reason not to like put in

252
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:32,240
song and then hop on YouTube and refresh the words in your head. So like, you know the song before

253
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:36,160
you get out there. Cause I also guarantee that the first like 10 songs you're going to pick in your

254
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:41,920
head have one moment in them that has a string of notes you can't hit. You know what I mean? That's

255
00:25:41,920 --> 00:25:46,000
the thing. You can't, you gotta look at the song as a whole and not be like, okay, I really know

256
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:49,680
the chorus and I can do that. And don't be afraid to just like stop singing and say, is everybody

257
00:25:49,680 --> 00:25:54,800
having a good time tonight? Yeah. Cause that usually works. And have a, have like a pocket

258
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:58,480
full of candy, like jolly ranchers that you can just like throw into the audience. And if you can

259
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:03,920
get one guy to stand behind you and pretend to play an inflatable sax, I think that really

260
00:26:03,920 --> 00:26:08,000
ratchets up the level. And then find the appropriate moment to take your shirt off.

261
00:26:08,560 --> 00:26:12,960
And I find that the audience just loves that. And then pull out your, your, uh, your wreck

262
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:18,560
penis and just like hit it against the microphone a few times. Yeah. That's how you win, win at

263
00:26:18,560 --> 00:26:25,280
karaoke, karaoke, the ancient art of embarrassing yourself. Um, that's the other thing. I'm really

264
00:26:25,280 --> 00:26:30,080
glad that you realize the fact that you don't want to be the guy that doesn't participate.

265
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:33,360
Cause that's, that's one of the most frustrating things for me when people go to karaoke and

266
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:37,840
they're like, I don't know, I don't really do it. I'm like, do you see those people up there? Like,

267
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:43,040
no one's up there winning American Idol. It is tantamount to sitting at the end of the pool.

268
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:47,680
Uh, like while everybody else swims at the pool party, like nobody's going to remember

269
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:51,360
if you get up there and do a shitty job. Everybody's going to remember if you,

270
00:26:52,160 --> 00:26:57,040
if you don't do it. Yeah. In fact, I like people to get up and do shitty jobs more

271
00:26:57,040 --> 00:27:00,640
because at least they don't fucking care. At least they're just doing it to participate.

272
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:05,120
I love that. And read the crowd too, because sometimes you might just want to punish them.

273
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:08,640
Sometimes you just might just want to make them pay for some of the songs you've been subjected

274
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:12,560
to. You got to remember it's not about you, even though everybody does sing karaoke because they

275
00:27:12,560 --> 00:27:18,160
like attention. Um, the only way you're going to get it is if you're, is if you're wanting the party

276
00:27:18,160 --> 00:27:21,840
to start, you want- I think that's unfair. That's an unfair assumption to make about everybody,

277
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:26,720
Justin. Cause when I say, like when I, when I sing karaoke, it's because I want to give,

278
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:31,840
like, I want to give my gift. Sure. Right. It's like, I want to share my gift to the,

279
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:36,400
with the world, you know? Right. Your self-absorption has gotten to such a,

280
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:39,920
a terminal case of it that you have to give it away. You have to give it away.

281
00:27:39,920 --> 00:27:46,000
I, I know they want it. Your viral, your viral load.

282
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,480
I know they want it. I got it to give.

283
00:27:49,920 --> 00:27:54,800
You have such a viral load of self-confidence that one compliment sends it spreading

284
00:27:54,800 --> 00:27:59,200
a pandemic like to every surrounding country. I just blow it.

285
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:04,960
You know what makes my heart want to sing? Nope. Money.

286
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:19,440
Ah, beautiful. Let's get out of the money zone.

287
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:21,200
Griffin? Yeah?

288
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:25,280
Have I told you about the Aldis project? You haven't told me anything about anything.

289
00:28:26,560 --> 00:28:28,720
I taught you. That's not true. I've taught you so much.

290
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:33,040
You taught me about the pro- you're, you told me about this one time you were talking about

291
00:28:33,040 --> 00:28:36,400
hunting down the entire family of Alan Alda. Yeah.

292
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:40,000
Is that what, is that what you're referring to? No, that isn't the Aldis project.

293
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:43,280
It's close. The Aldis project is 366 drawings for good.

294
00:28:43,280 --> 00:28:46,480
It's a year-long project by an artist named Christie Moderelli.

295
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:52,400
It's two-fold. One, it's a personal challenge to create 366 original drawings in as many days.

296
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:56,320
And she also is raising money for three of her favorite nonprofits.

297
00:28:57,040 --> 00:29:02,640
826 International, the Cherokee Foundation. It's just 826 National. They don't, they don't give

298
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:07,280
a, they don't give a fuck about other countries. 826 National, the Cherokee

299
00:29:07,280 --> 00:29:10,880
Foundat- I'm taking a shot in the dark pronunciation right here.

300
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:13,440
Shoerake. Shoerake Foundation,

301
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:18,000
and the Sea Shepherd Conservation Society. Said all those words, right?

302
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:23,040
They look out for sea sheep, of course. Each original drawing can be sold for $100

303
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:28,080
with $25 going to the buyer's choice of the three charities, and there are no additional

304
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:31,040
fees of any kind, including shipping. Well, that sounds awesome.

305
00:29:31,040 --> 00:29:35,200
That sounds, that's going to bring in a big buy. 366 drawings a day. That's

306
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:38,480
one drawing every day for the year. Yeah.

307
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:41,360
I see one- And where can people go to,

308
00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:46,960
to learn more about it, Juice? It's the Aldi, it's thealdisproject.com.

309
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:53,920
You know, the A-L-D-A-S project.com to learn more and buy one of these paintings.

310
00:29:53,920 --> 00:29:58,720
And I would suggest you do because they look really cool. One looks like a bunch of bacon

311
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:03,360
held up by sticks, so I love it. I love this painting.

312
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:06,160
Like a bacon fort? I never get art,

313
00:30:06,160 --> 00:30:11,120
and finally someone made a bacon fort and I'm there. I'm in it.

314
00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:12,720
I'm into it. You're in the bacon fort?

315
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:17,920
I'm living in the bacon fort. Sometimes when I put my penis in a cage,

316
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:23,600
I refer to the cage as a bacon fort. Wait a minute, your penis in a cage?

317
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:27,280
Where do you find penis cages at this time of year?

318
00:30:27,280 --> 00:30:33,600
Well, I used to try to make them, not gonna lie, but that's very difficult.

319
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:38,560
It's hard to do, welding, blacksmithing. I just leave it to the trained

320
00:30:38,560 --> 00:30:42,960
professional experts at Extreme Restraints. Extremerestraints.com?

321
00:30:44,560 --> 00:30:50,320
You know what, I've been thinking I should go there because my butt plug doesn't stretch my

322
00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:55,360
anus in a way that's pleasurable to me anymore. At this point, you've already done all the

323
00:30:55,360 --> 00:30:57,680
stretching you're gonna do. Your gauge is too high now.

324
00:30:57,680 --> 00:31:01,120
You gotta keep upgrading. I have to keep upgrading

325
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:06,000
to get that pleasurable spread that I enjoy. The main problem I had when I went to

326
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:11,120
Extremerestraints.com is that everything seemed to be 20% out of my price range.

327
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:18,000
I'm so glad you brought that up, Justin, because I can offer you and our listeners a deal that

328
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:22,800
for this week and any time that we mention Extreme Restraints on the show,

329
00:31:22,800 --> 00:31:29,600
we can give you a 20% off coupon code, and it's just MIDDLEST, M-I-D-D-L-E-S-T, MIDDLEST,

330
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:34,320
and you get 20% off. And even on the weeks when we don't talk about Extreme Restraints,

331
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:38,480
if you use the coupon code MIDDLEST, you still get 10% off your entire order.

332
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:44,000
It's a great coupon, and listen, your sex life is boring, whether you know it or not,

333
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:50,800
unless you have already bought electrodes and lube and a glory hole? Is that a thing?

334
00:31:50,800 --> 00:31:56,960
I don't know if you can buy a glory hole. I think you just find one in nature.

335
00:31:58,160 --> 00:32:03,920
You're gay now. That's going to take up a lot. You're federally gay. You're going to need a whole

336
00:32:03,920 --> 00:32:10,400
new flotilla of sex toys. I guess. Yeah, definitely. You can't use your old stuff.

337
00:32:12,560 --> 00:32:17,760
I don't know the utility of a pocket vagina. What do you mean, utility?

338
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:22,000
We got a lot of complaints last week because I said pocket and then the p-word that people use

339
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:26,240
sometimes to describe vaginas. But I think that's like the clinical name, right? That is the name

340
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:31,600
of the product. Well, not going to say it anymore because it's not that it's dirty or wrong,

341
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:37,600
but that I apparently have like a child's intonation, and it just takes people the wrong

342
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:42,960
way. When you say it, it's great intonation. Do yourself a favor and go check it out,

343
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:47,200
and it might surprise you, even if you wouldn't consider it to be your kind of thing,

344
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:51,440
I think it would surprise you the kind of things that they have there. What's the URL again?

345
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:55,760
It's ExtremeRestraints.com, and make sure to use the coupon code MEDALIST to get 20%

346
00:32:55,760 --> 00:32:58,160
off your order. Don't go to ExtremeRestraints.gov.

347
00:33:01,840 --> 00:33:07,360
They make you go to Guantanamo. It's terrible. It's a terrible website. You know what's not

348
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:12,800
terrible, though? What's that? Vigia games. Love them. Travis, have you heard of any cool ones?

349
00:33:12,800 --> 00:33:18,880
I have. There's a new project from the guys at Mob Rules Games. They're working on Haunts the

350
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:23,520
Manse Macabre, and we talked about it last week, and since then, you guys have been doing so good

351
00:33:23,520 --> 00:33:28,960
donating to their Kickstarter. Basically, they're looking for $25,000 to help finish their game so

352
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:38,000
they can get it released by October, and it's a turn-based adventure game, and the art style is

353
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:45,520
like Edward Gorey, Edgar Allen Poe-ish. It's awesome, and it's just an open-source, independent

354
00:33:45,520 --> 00:33:50,480
gaming thing. It's amazing, and the guys there are super cool, super great. Go check out their

355
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:59,360
Kickstarter. What is the Kickstarter at right now? It is $7,876. Okay, not bad. We gotta pick up the

356
00:33:59,360 --> 00:34:05,760
pace, though. Yeah, we gotta step it up. There's some time left to donate, so it's not too late,

357
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:10,320
and make sure if you do donate, make sure in the comments you tell them that NBNBAM sent you,

358
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:15,760
because that way they know that they have us to thank. You know, that it's all on us,

359
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:22,560
because we're awesome. I always get to this point where I want a highest level of pledge

360
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:28,160
where they have to name the game after me. How high do you think, though? I think if you gave all

361
00:34:28,160 --> 00:34:32,000
$25,000, you could probably make that happen. Yeah, I don't want it to be Haunts. I want it

362
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:37,440
to be Justin McElroy's Haunts. Justin McElroy Presents. Maybe not so much like a turn-based

363
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:42,480
adventure horror game, but like a platformer starring you. Yeah, right. And you gotta collect

364
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:47,840
all the candy. This is called It's Justin. It's Justin, the game. The Skittles Adventure.

365
00:34:48,400 --> 00:34:55,760
Where is my NBNBAM iOS game? Why is no one developing that? Come on. You just

366
00:34:55,760 --> 00:35:03,760
invented it just now. Somebody kickstarted it or something. That's at mobrulesgames.com,

367
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:08,960
right? And the donations on that Kickstarter start as low as $5. And for $5 you get a copy

368
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:15,120
of the game when it's done. It's a great deal. Yeah, and that's the low end. If you kick it up

369
00:35:15,120 --> 00:35:20,640
to like $25, you can get your name in the credits. Is your name in the credits anything else? No,

370
00:35:20,640 --> 00:35:24,320
it's not. You haven't accomplished anything. This is your chance to accomplish something

371
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:30,000
with your life. This is your big shot. Fuck up. So go on, you fuck up. Go to mobrulesgames.com

372
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:33,440
and see a link to the Kickstarter and just click it and fund it already. God,

373
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:37,280
make your parents proud of you for the first time ever. For the first time in history. Piece of

374
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:45,280
shit. You're such a disappointment. Somebody once told me your art is kind of old and boring.

375
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:56,160
You got to get some new art. Your art's got a shelf life of about 24 hours. So you better

376
00:35:56,160 --> 00:36:08,080
replace that art with new art. You can go to thealdisproject.com and buy a drawing every

377
00:36:08,080 --> 00:36:17,200
single day. That's thealdisproject.com. Send some money her way.

378
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:30,000
Hello there. My name is Graham Clark. And I'm Dave Shumka. And together we host a podcast called

379
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:35,200
Stop Podcasting Yourself. This is a file that you download from the internet and then you listen to

380
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:40,080
it in your pod. What's that about, you ask? Well, who are you to ask? Who do you think you are?

381
00:36:40,080 --> 00:36:45,680
Yeah, get lost, bozo. We're a couple of stand up comedians in Vancouver, British Columbia,

382
00:36:45,680 --> 00:36:50,400
Canada. And every week we bring a guest on the show. Sometimes they're Canadian,

383
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:55,200
sometimes they're not. Sometimes they're a ghost. It's like you're sitting in on a friendly

384
00:36:55,200 --> 00:37:02,800
afternoon chat. Plus we're Canadian, so you get a tax break. You can find us on iTunes or online

385
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:13,280
at maximumfun.org. I just finished my junior year of college. My spring semester would have been

386
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:20,400
satisfactory. A's and B's were not for a miserable D. Getting a D is depressing.

387
00:37:21,360 --> 00:37:27,040
At least your spelling's on point. For many reasons. I've never gotten below a C in a class

388
00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:31,680
and now I have to break the news to my parents who are generously paying for my college education.

389
00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:35,600
How do I tell my parents and how do I bounce back from this academic misstep? And that's

390
00:37:35,600 --> 00:37:40,320
from a dumb person. That's my, it says quote, that's my new name for myself.

391
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:45,360
All right, stop right there. That's what you got to stop doing. First of all,

392
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:50,240
everybody gets D's from time to time. I got a D in home economics in middle school.

393
00:37:50,240 --> 00:37:56,080
I got a D in earthquakes and volcanoes. Yeah. Cause you know why? Cause I don't give a shit

394
00:37:56,080 --> 00:38:01,200
about, we had to make nachos and I did a bad job. Hey, there's a D. You made bad nachos?

395
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:04,880
I'm not an idiot. I just made a, I made a fucking nachos mistake.

396
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:08,640
You know, I disagree, Griffin. I think if you can't nail down nachos.

397
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:14,400
It was my first time taking a stab at nachos. So like, sorry, we can't all be like fucking

398
00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:18,960
nachos geniuses. It's like nacho leeway.

399
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:24,720
Nachos idiot savants. Like it takes some time to ramp up to nachos. Anyway,

400
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:28,560
you fucked up, but guess what? You're not a dummy. Right.

401
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:32,000
Cause you got, you get good grades all the time. If you got bad grades all the time,

402
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:34,400
then you'd probably be a dummy. Hear that bad grade people.

403
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,880
Let me fill this out. Maybe don't tell your parents.

404
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:41,120
They got to, they're going to send them a report card.

405
00:38:41,120 --> 00:38:42,720
They don't send report cards in college.

406
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:44,000
I'm pretty sure they don't do that.

407
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:48,480
They do. Yeah, they would. They do. They'll send a, they'll send a note if you're,

408
00:38:49,520 --> 00:38:53,040
if you're failing for sure. But you're not failing. You got a D.

409
00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:56,480
Yeah. Maybe, maybe you're cool. Just go to your parents and say,

410
00:38:56,480 --> 00:39:00,560
Hey, fucked up my nachos. Don't worry about it. I'm an adult now.

411
00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:05,120
Look at my brother, Kevin. You guys messed that one up. He's a jerk. I hate his guts.

412
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:09,440
So what? I got bad geometry. Let's not make this about Kevin.

413
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:12,000
You're right. All right. Everything's always about Kevin.

414
00:39:14,160 --> 00:39:17,200
I, at my school, when I was in college, in my major,

415
00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:22,400
there was some rule. Like if you got below a C in a major's course, you had to take it over,

416
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:27,600
which always frustrated me as to why they even offered grades below a C. If that was the case,

417
00:39:27,600 --> 00:39:31,120
it might not just fail. It should just be A, B, C, and then nope.

418
00:39:31,120 --> 00:39:36,960
And then do it again. But like, if you're talking a gen ed course and like you got like a D in

419
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:40,720
chemistry, great. You're never going to use that in your philosophy degree.

420
00:39:40,720 --> 00:39:46,160
Yeah. Yeah. Sorry guys. I use like one fifth of the things I learned in college.

421
00:39:46,720 --> 00:39:50,960
Yeah. And most of it's like how to roll a, a doobie.

422
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:53,360
You know, just how to do some ageums.

423
00:39:53,360 --> 00:40:00,720
I was at, um, I, I was at Starbucks the other day and I got a, you know, a Venti drip and they're

424
00:40:00,720 --> 00:40:07,840
like, that's, that's $3.62. And I had a $5 bill in my wallet and I gave them the $5 bill. And then

425
00:40:07,840 --> 00:40:12,160
they use their register to figure out the exact change. And then they gave it back to me. No

426
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:17,280
maths involved. All I needed to know was my coffee preferences.

427
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:20,720
One further. In college, I had to take a botany class.

428
00:40:20,720 --> 00:40:21,280
Cool.

429
00:40:21,280 --> 00:40:23,360
Like in what way am I using that now?

430
00:40:23,360 --> 00:40:24,560
That would actually be handy.

431
00:40:24,560 --> 00:40:27,840
That would be handy. I'd like to be able to identify some of the plant life around me.

432
00:40:27,840 --> 00:40:31,040
You know what I can do now? I can be like, that's a tree versus a bush.

433
00:40:31,040 --> 00:40:32,480
And that over there, that's a flower.

434
00:40:33,040 --> 00:40:36,640
That's the, that's your, those are your three metrics depending on the size of the arbor.

435
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:37,600
Right.

436
00:40:37,600 --> 00:40:39,600
No, that was pretty big. I'm almost certain that's a tree.

437
00:40:39,600 --> 00:40:41,680
Gonna go with tree. Oh, it's a house?

438
00:40:41,680 --> 00:40:42,480
Fuck.

439
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:43,840
Shit. Damn it. It was big though.

440
00:40:43,840 --> 00:40:46,240
I didn't take house-ery in college.

441
00:40:46,240 --> 00:40:48,240
It was big and it had green on it.

442
00:40:48,240 --> 00:40:52,480
Um, there's no such thing as a permanent record and your D doesn't matter for shit.

443
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:54,560
You'll never go into a job interview and they'll be like,

444
00:40:54,560 --> 00:40:57,200
well, you're totally qualified and it looks like you have excellent references.

445
00:40:57,840 --> 00:41:02,160
Oh, it looks like you got a D in home economics because you made bad nachos.

446
00:41:02,160 --> 00:41:04,480
We're going to have to just, we're going to pass.

447
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:07,600
To what point, to what age in your guy's life did you,

448
00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:15,680
did you operate under the assumption that somewhere there was a manila folder with your

449
00:41:15,680 --> 00:41:20,080
name written on it that just, they transferred from school to school,

450
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:23,360
following you around for your entire life?

451
00:41:23,360 --> 00:41:28,320
I gave up on that junior year because I went into the office and I needed something from

452
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:32,880
like a high school AP course and they couldn't find that information.

453
00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:34,320
And I was like, you sons of bitches.

454
00:41:35,120 --> 00:41:35,760
You don't know me.

455
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:37,200
You don't know shit.

456
00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:40,320
You're not tracking anything I do.

457
00:41:40,320 --> 00:41:42,800
So since then I've left no paper trail.

458
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:44,240
You can just feel off the grid.

459
00:41:44,240 --> 00:41:48,880
I'm off the grid, I've been so careful until this show and that's how the mafia found me.

460
00:41:48,880 --> 00:41:51,440
Coming out this summer, the Charles McElroy story.

461
00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:52,160
It's boring.

462
00:41:52,720 --> 00:41:53,600
It's real bad.

463
00:41:54,640 --> 00:41:58,640
It's about how I owed $30 to the college library and they wouldn't send me my diploma.

464
00:41:59,280 --> 00:41:59,840
That's true.

465
00:42:01,840 --> 00:42:02,960
It seriously doesn't matter.

466
00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:08,000
And like, there's a reverse side of this where if you bust your ass getting like straight A's,

467
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:12,160
like I worked really hard in college and I graduated cumload and like,

468
00:42:12,160 --> 00:42:15,280
I like to this day.

469
00:42:15,280 --> 00:42:19,200
Do you know how many like Benny's that's gotten me post-grad?

470
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:21,120
Zilch, Zippo.

471
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:26,240
As long as you come away with the knowledge, it doesn't matter how well you test on it.

472
00:42:26,240 --> 00:42:29,520
As long as you pass the class and know your shit, that's all that matters.

473
00:42:29,520 --> 00:42:30,080
Yeah.

474
00:42:30,080 --> 00:42:31,040
You know what I mean?

475
00:42:31,040 --> 00:42:34,720
There's a reason why in the hit Tim McGraw song, Move Like You're Dying,

476
00:42:34,720 --> 00:42:37,760
he doesn't say skydiving, Rocky Mountain climbing,

477
00:42:38,320 --> 00:42:41,840
study my algebra until I did real good at it.

478
00:42:41,840 --> 00:42:43,200
And then there's that verse where he's like,

479
00:42:43,200 --> 00:42:47,680
I burned up all of my books except for my Bible today.

480
00:42:53,760 --> 00:42:55,760
Jesus, take the wheel.

481
00:42:56,960 --> 00:42:58,000
That's a good karaoke song.

482
00:42:58,000 --> 00:42:59,920
Take all of my books.

483
00:43:00,640 --> 00:43:04,160
I can't read the road signs, Jesus.

484
00:43:05,360 --> 00:43:06,400
I didn't learn.

485
00:43:06,400 --> 00:43:11,840
Learn, teach me how to add.

486
00:43:11,840 --> 00:43:13,920
Jesus, balance my checkbook.

487
00:43:15,120 --> 00:43:17,040
Adding and subtracting escapes me.

488
00:43:18,080 --> 00:43:20,480
I don't know how much to tip, Jesus.

489
00:43:20,480 --> 00:43:23,680
I still don't know what taxes are.

490
00:43:25,440 --> 00:43:29,200
Guys, this Yahoo answer is sent in by Kristen McMurt-

491
00:43:29,200 --> 00:43:30,000
Oh shit.

492
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:32,000
Kristen McMurtry.

493
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:32,320
Okay.

494
00:43:32,320 --> 00:43:33,520
Thank you, Kristen.

495
00:43:33,520 --> 00:43:34,800
Maybe work on that last name.

496
00:43:34,800 --> 00:43:37,120
It's by Yahoo Answers user Maria who asks,

497
00:43:37,680 --> 00:43:39,760
how loud is prom music?

498
00:43:39,760 --> 00:43:41,520
How to prevent ears from damage?

499
00:43:42,800 --> 00:43:46,800
This may sound weird, but I hate loud music and I am scared of it damaging my ears.

500
00:43:46,800 --> 00:43:50,560
I have prom next week and I don't want to be the weird one with big ear protectors on.

501
00:43:52,240 --> 00:43:54,160
I have never been to a prom before.

502
00:43:54,160 --> 00:43:55,280
Wait, what?

503
00:43:55,280 --> 00:43:56,880
I have never been to a prom before,

504
00:43:56,880 --> 00:44:01,680
so I was just wondering if they play the music really loud and if so, how to protect my ears.

505
00:44:01,680 --> 00:44:05,920
Okay. Madam, I have known you for all of one question.

506
00:44:06,560 --> 00:44:09,200
The ship has sailed on being the weird one.

507
00:44:09,200 --> 00:44:11,680
Like you, that has passed you by.

508
00:44:14,880 --> 00:44:26,000
Have you guys ever listened to T-Pain or T-I or I-Pain at a reasonable level of volume?

509
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:28,720
Like a smooth jazz undercurrent level.

510
00:44:28,720 --> 00:44:36,080
Yeah, like quiet car radio, you know, taking a bubble bath with your iPhone speakers.

511
00:44:36,080 --> 00:44:37,680
Like that level of sound?

512
00:44:38,400 --> 00:44:39,600
No, you can't.

513
00:44:39,600 --> 00:44:40,960
It's nigh-unlistenable.

514
00:44:40,960 --> 00:44:42,880
Your ears actually cannot detect it.

515
00:44:44,080 --> 00:44:45,120
It's like a dog whistle.

516
00:44:46,400 --> 00:44:51,840
And I guarantee that if I went there now, I'd think the music was really loud because I am old.

517
00:44:51,840 --> 00:44:53,280
Oh yeah, you're really old.

518
00:44:53,920 --> 00:44:57,920
What if you did just wear big headphones

519
00:44:57,920 --> 00:45:01,200
and you were listening to your own music and dancing to that?

520
00:45:02,400 --> 00:45:04,640
You just could call me maybe on repeat.

521
00:45:04,640 --> 00:45:07,600
Oh, that sounds like my dream world.

522
00:45:07,600 --> 00:45:07,920
Fuck.

523
00:45:07,920 --> 00:45:08,720
I know, right?

524
00:45:08,720 --> 00:45:09,360
So good.

525
00:45:09,360 --> 00:45:12,480
Pop in your skull candy and just listen away.

526
00:45:12,480 --> 00:45:16,320
Let Carly Rae Jessup just take you off to dream town.

527
00:45:17,360 --> 00:45:19,920
I'm going with you, Carly Rae Jessup.

528
00:45:19,920 --> 00:45:21,280
Fly me to the moon.

529
00:45:21,280 --> 00:45:24,720
Can you be the person at the prom who goes up to the DJ and is like,

530
00:45:24,720 --> 00:45:28,320
hey, can you maybe turn it down just a little bit?

531
00:45:28,320 --> 00:45:30,000
Would you play like some Chicago?

532
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:31,600
Something just like a little easier.

533
00:45:31,600 --> 00:45:33,360
It's not an unreasonable fear.

534
00:45:34,400 --> 00:45:39,280
Your ears are like tiny little rings with like a thin layer of saran wrap.

535
00:45:39,280 --> 00:45:41,200
And if that saran wrap breaks, guess what?

536
00:45:41,200 --> 00:45:41,840
You're deaf.

537
00:45:43,120 --> 00:45:44,000
You can't hear anymore.

538
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:44,720
That's how that works.

539
00:45:45,680 --> 00:45:49,920
I'm a little more worried about the pregnancy.

540
00:45:49,920 --> 00:45:53,840
Like there's so many more dangers at prom to be concerned about.

541
00:45:53,840 --> 00:45:55,920
You're worried about ear babies.

542
00:45:56,720 --> 00:45:57,280
No, no.

543
00:45:58,720 --> 00:46:03,200
Despite what Arnani told us growing up, rock music doesn't make your ears pregnant.

544
00:46:03,200 --> 00:46:05,120
What I'm worried about, yeah, I know.

545
00:46:05,120 --> 00:46:07,600
What I'm worried about is the underage sex.

546
00:46:07,600 --> 00:46:08,320
Yeah.

547
00:46:08,320 --> 00:46:09,760
There's sex at prom?

548
00:46:11,600 --> 00:46:12,560
Is that where it's happening?

549
00:46:14,400 --> 00:46:20,560
I mean, the grinding was pretty hot and heavy in 2005.

550
00:46:22,720 --> 00:46:23,360
Sorry, everyone.

551
00:46:23,360 --> 00:46:23,920
I'm a baby.

552
00:46:26,880 --> 00:46:30,160
I can only imagine how things have escalated because they've escalated

553
00:46:30,160 --> 00:46:32,000
in literally every other way.

554
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:39,120
And if the grinding was like super, super gnar when I was 18, like now that I'm 25,

555
00:46:40,720 --> 00:46:44,720
I bet you people are just like getting their dicks dirty right there on the floor.

556
00:46:44,720 --> 00:46:46,560
And side note, this is a weird transition,

557
00:46:46,560 --> 00:46:49,280
but I can only imagine there's another good karaoke song.

558
00:46:49,280 --> 00:46:53,920
Where did that come from?

559
00:46:54,560 --> 00:46:59,440
You're literally the worst person of all people.

560
00:46:59,440 --> 00:47:00,240
You are the worst.

561
00:47:00,880 --> 00:47:05,200
I can only imagine how to read.

562
00:47:09,520 --> 00:47:14,320
I can only imagine where Mexico is.

563
00:47:14,320 --> 00:47:21,360
I can only imagine how many branches of the government there are.

564
00:47:23,760 --> 00:47:24,400
Joke's on you.

565
00:47:24,400 --> 00:47:25,520
There's only one.

566
00:47:25,520 --> 00:47:26,320
It's Jesus.

567
00:47:27,600 --> 00:47:28,560
He's got the wheel.

568
00:47:28,560 --> 00:47:29,200
He's my judge.

569
00:47:29,200 --> 00:47:33,040
I used to have it before Barack Hussein Obama yanked it out of his hands

570
00:47:33,040 --> 00:47:35,440
and started steering his own ship.

571
00:47:36,240 --> 00:47:42,560
He's my Supreme Court justice, majority whip, and president and commander in chief.

572
00:47:42,560 --> 00:47:45,440
And my king forever.

573
00:47:47,280 --> 00:47:53,920
This Yahoo was sent in by Liana, which was sent to her by her friend Keith.

574
00:47:53,920 --> 00:47:56,160
So thank you both people in this arrangement.

575
00:47:56,160 --> 00:47:57,360
For the second hand Yahoo.

576
00:47:58,560 --> 00:48:01,200
Many, many Bothans died to bring us this Yahoo.

577
00:48:01,200 --> 00:48:02,240
So let's really enjoy it.

578
00:48:02,240 --> 00:48:06,080
It was asked by Yahoo Answers user Geof who asks,

579
00:48:07,440 --> 00:48:10,320
is it okay to draw on a dog with magic marker?

580
00:48:10,320 --> 00:48:16,560
Sometimes when my stepdad Ron grounds me, I'll write messages on my dog.

581
00:48:16,560 --> 00:48:19,680
He is white with washable marker and send him downstairs.

582
00:48:20,400 --> 00:48:24,960
Just little messages, like if I need food or about how much I hate my stepdad Ron.

583
00:48:26,960 --> 00:48:28,800
My mom said it would make the dog sick.

584
00:48:28,800 --> 00:48:29,520
Is she right?

585
00:48:33,200 --> 00:48:36,800
So many more problems with the best stepdad name ever is Ron.

586
00:48:37,840 --> 00:48:38,800
Got some dog mail.

587
00:48:38,800 --> 00:48:41,120
Got some dog mail for you, Ron.

588
00:48:41,120 --> 00:48:41,840
Fuck off.

589
00:48:44,160 --> 00:48:45,360
I hate you, Ron.

590
00:48:45,360 --> 00:48:46,560
I hate you so much.

591
00:48:46,560 --> 00:48:47,600
Come here, Mr. Perkins.

592
00:48:48,320 --> 00:48:48,800
What's it?

593
00:48:49,680 --> 00:48:50,320
Oh, man.

594
00:48:51,520 --> 00:48:53,120
It really helps my, that hurts my self esteem.

595
00:48:53,120 --> 00:48:54,320
I'm trying so hard.

596
00:48:54,320 --> 00:48:55,600
It hurts my Ron esteem.

597
00:48:55,600 --> 00:48:56,640
I don't like that one bit.

598
00:48:58,640 --> 00:49:00,880
Can you give me the question one more time, Griffin?

599
00:49:00,880 --> 00:49:02,720
Is it okay to draw on a dog with magic marker?

600
00:49:03,520 --> 00:49:06,400
Sometimes when my stepdad Ron grounds me, I'll write messages on my dog.

601
00:49:06,400 --> 00:49:10,640
He is white with magic marker.

602
00:49:10,640 --> 00:49:14,480
Just little messages, like if I need food or about how much I hate my stepdad Ron.

603
00:49:15,200 --> 00:49:19,920
I'm imagining like a Yorkshire Terrier like bounding down the stairs running up to Ron

604
00:49:19,920 --> 00:49:22,960
and it's like a message on him like, hey, Ron, I smell that chili.

605
00:49:22,960 --> 00:49:23,600
What the fuck?

606
00:49:23,600 --> 00:49:24,880
You're such a bastard.

607
00:49:24,880 --> 00:49:26,240
I'm super hungry.

608
00:49:26,240 --> 00:49:27,600
He's got a message for you, Ron.

609
00:49:27,600 --> 00:49:28,240
I'm a dog.

610
00:49:29,520 --> 00:49:32,160
And also the person asking this question is 32.

611
00:49:32,160 --> 00:49:32,320
Yeah.

612
00:49:33,120 --> 00:49:34,080
God damn you, Ron.

613
00:49:34,080 --> 00:49:36,480
Now, now listen to me, Sparky.

614
00:49:36,480 --> 00:49:37,680
I want you to go downstairs.

615
00:49:37,680 --> 00:49:41,200
I want you to find Ron and I want you to just wiggle in front of him.

616
00:49:41,200 --> 00:49:42,560
You gotta make sure he reads this.

617
00:49:42,560 --> 00:49:43,280
It's important.

618
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:46,160
I've been trapped in this bookcase for two weeks.

619
00:49:46,160 --> 00:49:48,000
I gotta get some pasta up here.

620
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:48,640
So hungry.

621
00:49:48,640 --> 00:49:50,640
Also tell Ron, fuck you, Ron.

622
00:49:51,760 --> 00:49:54,880
If Ron wants to rescue me, tell him to fuck clean off.

623
00:49:54,880 --> 00:49:55,600
I hate Ron.

624
00:49:56,160 --> 00:50:00,640
Tell him to send my mom and ask if my mom is back with my fruit rollups yet.

625
00:50:00,640 --> 00:50:03,840
I sent her to the store 20 minutes ago for fruit rollups.

626
00:50:03,840 --> 00:50:04,640
Oh, Mr.

627
00:50:04,640 --> 00:50:06,160
Perkins, you look kind of sick.

628
00:50:06,720 --> 00:50:07,520
What happened?

629
00:50:07,520 --> 00:50:08,560
Oh, is it the markers?

630
00:50:08,560 --> 00:50:09,060
Jesus.

631
00:50:10,320 --> 00:50:11,360
Seeking your skin?

632
00:50:11,360 --> 00:50:12,160
It's you or me, Mr.

633
00:50:12,160 --> 00:50:12,660
Perkins.

634
00:50:13,920 --> 00:50:15,440
Maybe you learned how to talk English.

635
00:50:16,640 --> 00:50:17,680
Stupid dog.

636
00:50:19,040 --> 00:50:19,680
Poor Ron.

637
00:50:21,200 --> 00:50:22,240
What a fucking sick bird.

638
00:50:22,240 --> 00:50:24,080
He's just trying to watch Extreme Home Makeover.

639
00:50:24,880 --> 00:50:26,880
And all of a sudden the dog trots in front of his face.

640
00:50:26,880 --> 00:50:29,840
It's like a drawing of a knife stab and it just appears.

641
00:50:29,840 --> 00:50:32,240
And it's just an arrow that says Ron.

642
00:50:32,240 --> 00:50:33,440
This is you, Ron.

643
00:50:33,440 --> 00:50:34,480
This is what I want to do to you.

644
00:50:34,480 --> 00:50:35,200
Look at the dog.

645
00:50:38,320 --> 00:50:39,280
Oh, Jesus.

646
00:50:39,280 --> 00:50:41,360
It says, I love you, Ron, I'm my dog.

647
00:50:41,360 --> 00:50:42,320
Oh, he rolled over.

648
00:50:42,320 --> 00:50:43,360
It says, no, I don't.

649
00:50:43,360 --> 00:50:45,440
And he says, fuck you, Ron, again on it.

650
00:50:45,440 --> 00:50:46,000
And it says, chilly.

651
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:47,680
With an arrow towards the dog's penis.

652
00:50:50,800 --> 00:50:53,120
Tyler, I thought you were going to come pick me up from work.

653
00:50:53,120 --> 00:50:54,640
Did you not read the dog?

654
00:50:54,640 --> 00:50:57,440
I said, I said, fuck you and fuck your job.

655
00:50:57,440 --> 00:50:58,560
I'm not going to pick you up.

656
00:50:58,560 --> 00:51:00,880
Oh, and also that we were out of eggs.

657
00:51:00,880 --> 00:51:01,760
And also we're out of eggs.

658
00:51:01,760 --> 00:51:02,480
Did you tell mom?

659
00:51:03,360 --> 00:51:04,720
I wrote it on the dog, Ron.

660
00:51:05,360 --> 00:51:06,400
What else do you want me to do?

661
00:51:06,400 --> 00:51:07,760
What else do you want me to do?

662
00:51:07,760 --> 00:51:11,200
I can't, I can't force the dog to stand in front of you all day.

663
00:51:11,840 --> 00:51:12,880
Please just read the dog.

664
00:51:13,440 --> 00:51:16,560
You used all the paper for your stupid novel, Ron.

665
00:51:16,560 --> 00:51:17,920
Yeah, how's that going, Ron?

666
00:51:17,920 --> 00:51:20,000
Did you find a publisher yet?

667
00:51:21,760 --> 00:51:24,880
In this economy, Ron, you might as well self-publish your stupid shit.

668
00:51:24,880 --> 00:51:25,360
Can we?

669
00:51:25,360 --> 00:51:26,240
Put it on Kindle.

670
00:51:26,240 --> 00:51:30,080
I've got a, I've got a Tumblr dog where I just put messages.

671
00:51:30,080 --> 00:51:31,440
Why can't you get a Tumblr dog?

672
00:51:32,240 --> 00:51:34,480
Can we make it a new law?

673
00:51:35,040 --> 00:51:39,520
Sort of like in Game of Thrones when you, if you're a bastard, your name is Snow.

674
00:51:39,520 --> 00:51:42,960
Can we make it that when the second you become a stepdad, your name becomes,

675
00:51:42,960 --> 00:51:45,040
it just becomes Ron by law?

676
00:51:45,040 --> 00:51:47,200
Legally, legally speaking.

677
00:51:47,200 --> 00:51:49,920
I now pronounce you wife and Ron.

678
00:51:49,920 --> 00:51:54,000
It's not even, it's not even your name so much as like,

679
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:57,440
like Earl is like an honorary title, but his name is not Earl.

680
00:51:57,440 --> 00:52:00,320
You're officially like the Don of this house.

681
00:52:00,320 --> 00:52:00,960
You're Don Ron.

682
00:52:00,960 --> 00:52:01,680
You're the Ron.

683
00:52:01,680 --> 00:52:02,320
You're the Ron.

684
00:52:02,320 --> 00:52:03,760
You're the Ron Don.

685
00:52:03,760 --> 00:52:04,880
You're the Ron Don of this.

686
00:52:10,560 --> 00:52:11,680
Fuck you, Ron.

687
00:52:11,680 --> 00:52:12,480
I'm Ron.

688
00:52:12,480 --> 00:52:14,080
Ron, you can fucking eat a dick.

689
00:52:14,080 --> 00:52:15,840
I am Ron Don Johnson.

690
00:52:15,840 --> 00:52:18,480
And as long as you're living underneath my roof.

691
00:52:18,480 --> 00:52:20,320
I am Don Ron Don Johnson.

692
00:52:20,320 --> 00:52:22,320
I am Don Ron Don Johnson.

693
00:52:22,320 --> 00:52:24,480
As long as you're living underneath my roof,

694
00:52:24,480 --> 00:52:27,920
you will not melt down my Miami Vice VHS tapes.

695
00:52:27,920 --> 00:52:28,480
Those are collector's items.

696
00:52:28,480 --> 00:52:30,960
And you will respect my friend Cheech Marin.

697
00:52:30,960 --> 00:52:32,000
He will let you.

698
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:33,760
And my friend Don Ron Don Cheetle.

699
00:52:35,280 --> 00:52:38,400
And you'll stop sending your stupid ass Tumblr dog down

700
00:52:38,400 --> 00:52:43,200
with messages about how you preferred the earlier seasons of National Bridges.

701
00:52:43,200 --> 00:52:44,080
I'm done with you.

702
00:52:44,960 --> 00:52:46,400
Stop it with the Tumblr dog.

703
00:52:46,400 --> 00:52:47,040
We've had enough.

704
00:52:47,040 --> 00:52:48,560
Your mom and I are very much in love.

705
00:52:48,560 --> 00:52:51,440
Listen, she's not getting back with your dad.

706
00:52:51,440 --> 00:52:56,080
Do you think at some point you have to start using the dog to repair the relationship?

707
00:52:56,080 --> 00:52:59,840
Like, just a note that says, Ron, I wish we could be closer.

708
00:53:00,800 --> 00:53:02,160
Ron, I think we should talk.

709
00:53:02,160 --> 00:53:02,960
Ron, we should talk.

710
00:53:02,960 --> 00:53:04,480
Ron, my mom's seen sad lately.

711
00:53:04,480 --> 00:53:07,760
When was the last time you treated her out to a night on the tag?

712
00:53:08,320 --> 00:53:09,440
Night on the tag?

713
00:53:09,440 --> 00:53:10,640
I'm so hungry.

714
00:53:10,640 --> 00:53:11,360
Please send the dog.

715
00:53:13,920 --> 00:53:17,360
Ron, please send the dog.

716
00:53:17,360 --> 00:53:19,520
Please send the dog for snacks.

717
00:53:20,960 --> 00:53:22,000
Hate you, Ron.

718
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:22,960
Hashtag hungry.

719
00:53:24,800 --> 00:53:25,840
So this has been our dog show.

720
00:53:25,840 --> 00:53:26,960
My brother, my brother, mate.

721
00:53:26,960 --> 00:53:28,320

00:53:55,360 --> 00:53:56,160

735

I want to thank John Roderick and the Long Winters for the use of a theme song.

736
00:54:28,080 --> 00:54:30,640
It's a departure off the album, putting the days to bed.

737
00:54:30,640 --> 00:54:33,360
Thank you, guys, gang.

738
00:54:33,840 --> 00:54:34,560

Yeah, I swear to God.

746
00:55:02,080 --> 00:55:06,880
If somebody sends me a dead dog with stuff written on it, I get one more dog in a box.

747
00:55:06,880 --> 00:55:10,720
I know this finally who is also sent in by Emily Wall.

748
00:55:10,720 --> 00:55:11,200
Thank you.

749
00:55:11,200 --> 00:55:17,200
It's by Yahoo Answers user Sandy, who asks, Why do black men love eating chips at the

750
00:55:17,200 --> 00:55:17,680
beach?

751
00:55:17,680 --> 00:55:21,120
Is it to be energized for us ladies before they take a dip?

752
00:55:21,120 --> 00:55:42,880
Keep your heart three stacks.

753
00:55:42,880 --> 00:55:43,840
