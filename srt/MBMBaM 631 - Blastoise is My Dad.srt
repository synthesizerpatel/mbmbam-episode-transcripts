1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,820
The McElroy brothers are not experts and their advice should never be followed

2
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:10,580
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it

3
00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:17,660
Also, this show isn't for kids which I mentioned only so the babies out there will know how cool they are for listening

4
00:00:17,660 --> 00:00:30,660
What's up, you cool, baby?

5
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:50,500
It's better, it's better with you

6
00:00:53,980 --> 00:00:55,980
It's better, it's better with you

7
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:02,300
It's better, it's better with you

8
00:01:11,020 --> 00:01:16,980
Hello everybody and welcome my brother my brother main advice show for the modular. I'm your oldest brother Justin McElroy

9
00:01:16,980 --> 00:01:22,980
I'm your miller's brother Travis the unstoppable McElroy. I'm Griffin. Whoa, they tried to get me

10
00:01:22,980 --> 00:01:26,740
I'm Griffin McElroy enough about you. I'm Griffin

11
00:01:27,380 --> 00:01:30,540
Mackle but Travis Travis is back. I'm unstoppable

12
00:01:30,980 --> 00:01:34,780
He's unstoppable. They can I'm down. I just want to say and

13
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:40,100
listen, I mean I yeah, I had coven and it gave me a lot of time to think and

14
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:45,940
And maybe some of the threads and the tapestry revealed themselves to me. Oh boy

15
00:01:45,940 --> 00:01:49,900
It became pretty obvious to me that this whole coven thing was a conspiracy

16
00:01:50,420 --> 00:01:53,580
Don't look my thing is don't look too close at the loom

17
00:01:54,220 --> 00:01:57,740
So we all make that or the loom looks back. Here's the thing

18
00:01:57,740 --> 00:02:03,220
I don't know if you guys noticed this I got coven shortly after Joe Biden was like, okay pandemics done

19
00:02:03,620 --> 00:02:08,420
Kind of makes it seem like maybe it was all set up to get to me waiting

20
00:02:08,420 --> 00:02:10,260
until

21
00:02:10,260 --> 00:02:14,940
The party don't stop till Travis gets kovat and walk in

22
00:02:15,380 --> 00:02:21,420
More like Jovid because it seems like he set this whole thing up to take me out of the game Jovid

23
00:02:21,420 --> 00:02:26,460
I wonder if anyone's ever said that yeah, and this close to election season

24
00:02:26,460 --> 00:02:32,020
Maybe trying to take this key player that out of the game some red flags and okay

25
00:02:32,020 --> 00:02:38,520
Clack songs for me. Well Travis. Yeah about one month before election season Jovid

26
00:02:38,780 --> 00:02:43,960
Finally came to the culmination of his two and a half year plan to doubt Travis out of the game

27
00:02:44,060 --> 00:02:48,340
And we all saw the numbers shift when Trav when Trav E got it

28
00:02:48,820 --> 00:02:53,740
Or rather I guess when it got Trav E when it got to me, but you know what I fucking beat it Joe

29
00:02:53,740 --> 00:02:59,300
Yeah, I got it Joe we beat I beat it. So Joe Rogan

30
00:02:59,300 --> 00:03:07,100
Oh sucks, but got a lot it sort of buzz about him when he got

31
00:03:07,540 --> 00:03:10,140
Kovat. Yeah, and then think of those numbers

32
00:03:10,420 --> 00:03:17,780
Well, he took off his clothes his clothes revealing his big beautiful body and he did like his secret like

33
00:03:18,340 --> 00:03:20,540
You know Alex Jones spa

34
00:03:21,020 --> 00:03:22,140
sesh

35
00:03:22,140 --> 00:03:26,620
that he did that helped him kind of like hop over it and so

36
00:03:26,620 --> 00:03:30,780
Obviously everything we're about to say is a goof in a bit

37
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:36,900
But is there anything that you want to share about sort of your recovery period?

38
00:03:37,940 --> 00:03:40,260
That you could go viral for no pun intended

39
00:03:41,980 --> 00:03:43,380
Yeah, just for that

40
00:03:43,380 --> 00:03:49,580
I mean, I know Jovids over and no one else is gonna get it but I'm gonna get it if hypothetically someone did if there were

41
00:03:49,580 --> 00:03:55,020
Some key learnings that you had and this is a joke and a bit. Yeah, I ate a lot of cookies

42
00:03:55,020 --> 00:03:57,020
A good bunch of what kind? Oh

43
00:03:57,460 --> 00:04:00,580
Any kind I could get my hand on really a lot of the soft bake

44
00:04:01,140 --> 00:04:08,100
I had some German style cookies from the Aldi that really helped power me through that vitamin cookie

45
00:04:08,460 --> 00:04:13,100
Interesting knitting but the blanket I made is far too wide far too wide

46
00:04:13,740 --> 00:04:21,020
Which I'm regretting is a scarf. Well, no, it's a blanket for my child. Yeah, but it's too wide. It's a scarf

47
00:04:21,020 --> 00:04:25,140
It's a scar. Oh, wait. We're doing a bit right now about

48
00:04:26,460 --> 00:04:29,740
Travis's Joe Rogan Alex Jones spa techniques to get over kovat

49
00:04:29,740 --> 00:04:33,700
But I do actually want to explore Justin's bit that he's just proposed which is like

50
00:04:36,380 --> 00:04:39,000
Bit is like putting it to struggle. Yeah. Okay

51
00:04:39,700 --> 00:04:44,780
And so wait, so Justin that's all it was is that if I stop making the blanket now, yeah

52
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:47,300
It's a scarf. Yeah

53
00:04:47,820 --> 00:04:49,820
And if you had started a while back

54
00:04:49,820 --> 00:04:54,140
You know, you would have had a nice little maybe a potholder. Yeah

55
00:04:54,860 --> 00:04:56,460
Coaster. Oh

56
00:04:56,460 --> 00:04:58,760
Trav, I'm sorry. You got

57
00:04:59,620 --> 00:05:00,380
I'm sorry

58
00:05:00,380 --> 00:05:04,940
You got covered but good news is you had plenty of time to watch hocus-pocus, too

59
00:05:04,940 --> 00:05:08,340
And I'm one more like joke is focused to it's part of it

60
00:05:09,140 --> 00:05:11,140
Okay, more like crocus

61
00:05:11,980 --> 00:05:16,740
You watch hocus-pocus to you. How many times I wanted to do a quick count just like how many yeah

62
00:05:16,740 --> 00:05:23,740
How many times you probably are gonna put us to shame. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah a leaderboard trap. I

63
00:05:24,620 --> 00:05:27,340
Watched Josie and the Pussycats for the first time. Ah

64
00:05:29,540 --> 00:05:35,700
And that kind of took up took up a lot of my time I watched I

65
00:05:36,860 --> 00:05:37,980
watched

66
00:05:37,980 --> 00:05:41,940
All of season 12 a taskmaster. Are you gonna tell me single digits?

67
00:05:41,940 --> 00:05:48,200
Well, I guess Justin that depends on if you consider zero a digit. Yeah, it's one

68
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:54,660
I guess it's that would be now that the definition of zero is a mathematical value between positive and negative values

69
00:05:54,660 --> 00:05:56,660
So I do not think that is a single

70
00:05:57,700 --> 00:05:59,060
single number

71
00:05:59,060 --> 00:06:02,180
But if I had ten you would say that's a digit number

72
00:06:04,220 --> 00:06:09,620
Your shot and you blew actually dead to me stranger Griffin, yeah, what's your count of hocus-pocus, too

73
00:06:09,620 --> 00:06:12,620
I can't believe you'd even ask me something like that

74
00:06:13,900 --> 00:06:16,180
You old dog. What's the number?

75
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:25,020
Two is the number at the end of the film hocus-pocus, too. You thought and here's what's fucked up. Yeah

76
00:06:25,580 --> 00:06:27,580
It's scary that

77
00:06:27,820 --> 00:06:31,260
in the first movie these three

78
00:06:32,940 --> 00:06:38,320
Sorcerers did a lot of pretty heinous shit mostly two kids and we have a lot of fun

79
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:39,520
watching

80
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:45,160
Watching bet fly around on her vacuum or whatever and we love to see Kathy and a Jimmy up there

81
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:51,120
Just like making us bust up but like they were trained to for sure kill some kids and they kill some kids

82
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:54,060
Yeah, they definitely they're they're KD Raich

83
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:57,280
vis-a-vis kids is higher than

84
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:01,040
Acceptable limits they killed at least two kids

85
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:07,320
This is what I wanted to speak on and I'm gonna try to not go into hocus-pocus to spoil you too much

86
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:13,560
But because I know the community's seen it but you know, you never know maybe people scheduling it

87
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:16,920
these these these

88
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:19,640
ladies, yeah, really

89
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:25,640
Stretch of the definition because they don't act very ladylike. No, thank you. Thank you Travis

90
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:30,400
So, you know half of their story search. All right. Yeah, you know what egg on my face

91
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:33,000
I think became cultural icons

92
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:39,240
Right and it to an extent where and they were so I would say this is like they're memetic, you know

93
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:48,520
The returns of Sanders and sisters and I just I gotta wonder how many times Disney have been like we really wish

94
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:51,640
We hadn't had them eat kids. Yeah

95
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:55,080
We went pretty hard on that

96
00:07:55,200 --> 00:08:02,200
Yeah, and the first time you see the Sanders and sisters in this new movie hocus-pocus, too

97
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:05,640
they are immediately doing a rendition of

98
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:08,200
the bitch is back, but

99
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:11,960
It's the witches. Oh shit, which is her back

100
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:16,920
That's a media the three of them and it's like split-screen like do do do do

101
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:17,160
Yeah

102
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:20,920
And I was watching it with about eight people and everybody's kind of like a the same

103
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:25,280
Sisters got bopping around and I'm kind of thinking myself. They do kill kids. They kill any

104
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:27,520
Sure

105
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:32,700
They killed so many kids. We had to kill them and then you put them on enough

106
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:37,120
Fucking Halloween costumes. Yeah, and all of a sudden it's like well, what's a kid?

107
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:41,440
I don't I bet you could charge and I'm I don't hold me to the timeline of this

108
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:45,240
But it seems to me that you could chart like Disney did hocus-pocus

109
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,020
definite 100% kid death and then

110
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:53,880
Subsequent Disney films, especially the made-for-tv ones. They're like we got a mummy

111
00:08:53,880 --> 00:09:00,000
I think there's a werewolf in there either leprechaun, but zero kid death in them even in like under wraps

112
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:05,720
The mummy is like pretty chill. Yeah, never kills a kid and it was like they were like we

113
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:11,840
We went hard on that one and everyone seems to love the ones that killed the kids the most

114
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:12,280
Yeah

115
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:17,760
None of the other ones hit as hard as the three ladies who murdered a child in the first five minutes

116
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:24,620
Everyone's just wild about these these ladies that murder and what scares me is that they can't they can't be killed. So it's like

117
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:26,960
law of large numbers eventually

118
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:30,600
Every kid is done. So every child is done

119
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:37,620
So leave no child left behind out of their cauldron where they will mash them into some sort of hold

120
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:40,520
anti-aging poultice

121
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:47,120
Style yeah style and there's nothing we can do about it because they can't die. It's not fair

122
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:50,680
It's a joke from God on us. Hey Justin

123
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:56,180
Can you tell me one thing and this is a spoiler, of course, but and everybody jump ahead three seconds. He's Salem in it

124
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:57,980
Salem

125
00:09:57,980 --> 00:10:04,480
Do you do you mean you don't mean Salem Salem's from oh, you're right, right, right the cat arena the teenager

126
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:06,840
binks binks

127
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:09,480
Binks factory binks. I can't believe

128
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:15,520
Fucking forgot that name you remember his first name. Yes, but you forget his cat

129
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:20,400
I'm factory being a voice by Jason Marsden played by a different actor in the film

130
00:10:21,140 --> 00:10:25,840
Which I love because they basically said we don't want it to look like Jason Marsden and we don't want it to sound like you

131
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:34,400
I mean that happened but not since David Prowse and James Earl Jones

132
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:48,240
I actually don't know. It's inconclusive Travis. Wait, how many times have you seen the film doesn't

133
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:54,760
I will say this infinitely more than you guys

134
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:57,880
Okay, did you did you have to cover your eyes through most of it justice?

135
00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:00,440
None of it was very scary

136
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:08,160
I will I will give you one incredible twist that I did not see coming and this is really gonna freak you out

137
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:11,120
Sam Richardson is a treasure and a huge

138
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:13,800
addition to the film so

139
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:19,200
Twist Sam Richardson is bringing his a-game and is a delight is for every phrase Doug Jones back

140
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:22,380
It's Billy Butchers Billy Butcherson Billy the zombie

141
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:27,840
Billy Billy for zombie Billy was always back and hanky-panky

142
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:43,000
Yeah, it's good, it's uh, yeah, there's probably a lot of reasons why it's immoral to recommend it hocus-pocus, too

143
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:48,720
Let's uh, this is an advice show

144
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:55,680
Quick Yeti update. I received four offers of a Yeti cooler since our last recording

145
00:11:55,680 --> 00:12:00,440
I got an expiring soon. Your name came up for a Yeti hopper cooler

146
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:07,900
Well, I've been chosen for a Yeti hopper into any cooler. Yeah, please verify where to send the newest model yet. Hurry up

147
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:14,680
Confirm now another Yeti backpack cooler. I've won so many of these things. Yeah, you all would not even believe

148
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:20,600
So what are you doing with all of yeah, what are you gonna do with it? Yeah, you don't really live I would say a cooler

149
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:25,120
Lifestyle, you're not usually out in places where you

150
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:27,880
Don't have access to cold

151
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:29,640
beverages and in fact

152
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:35,440
I would go so far as to say Griffin that Justin has arranged a lot of his like decisions to make sure he's never too

153
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:42,040
Far away from a place where he could put things to become cold. That's a great. Yeah, it's a great question. I've received

154
00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:50,880
I have one according to the spam folder of my email. I've won 30 for Yeti coolers shit. Hey, yeah, it's May

155
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:57,560
Yeah, but that's how they get you because what they want me to do is pay for shipping. Mm-hmm. I bet on each one

156
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:58,920
So I'm not gonna do that

157
00:12:58,920 --> 00:13:04,000
I'm gonna wait until it seems like the tide has stemmed of Yeti coolers that I have won and

158
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:06,880
Then I will say ship them all to me. Oh

159
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:12,040
Oh in one in bulk. I think our I think cool. I think our nation's

160
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:18,920
Dwindling beautiful Yeti population is how are you having a tough enough time?

161
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:26,600
Yeah, we don't need to be killing them and turning their you know, it's a cavity sort of chest cavities into

162
00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:33,000
Beer beer. I got pretty serious. You really brought it down. Go funding didn't expect it to go such a place

163
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:35,360
This is an advice show

164
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:36,800
and

165
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:41,480
I'm so thrilled to be here. We were we missed you last week, and I'm happy to be back. That's all there is to it

166
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:48,600
Sorry. Yeah, sorry. I got coven San Jose Denver. We're sorry. I felt so terrible. He really did

167
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:53,800
You really thought I was worried about him. Yeah, we all feel bad. I had to be with my I

168
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:57,880
Had to be with my family all week. I didn't get to go to the Winchester Mystery House

169
00:13:58,520 --> 00:14:03,200
Which I was really planning to let's just say but we've all suffered. Yeah, we've all suffered

170
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:09,880
You guys through your own violence by not watching hocus-pocus, too. That's a suffering you've brought on yourself. I'm good

171
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:14,720
Ah, I'm looking to get some advice on what to do if you're at a super fancy and official art auction

172
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:17,200
Yes, where people raise little numbered signs to bet on art

173
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:24,560
Best the best the dream dream the dream. I'd be so paranoid right is that I would actually bid. Yeah

174
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:26,800
Keep reading Justin

175
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:33,180
What if you goof up and dress all posh and then you get yourself one of the number bid signs and you place a bid

176
00:14:33,180 --> 00:14:38,960
On purpose that you know, you can't pay but you think somebody will immediately outbid you but nobody does and the gavel is struck

177
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:40,960
You what it what's the best excuse?

178
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:48,280
Or way to get out of your poor decision-making. That's from Ben who I have to say an extremely specific email Ben

179
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:50,280
I'm a little bit nervous, but

180
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:55,640
Relate I'm saying I think Ben may have may have stumbled into this this scenario

181
00:14:55,640 --> 00:15:02,360
Maybe what I've got what I've got is a very particular set of skills by which I mean a very specific anxiety

182
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:10,080
which I guarantee is shared by like 90% of the adult population and that is the specific anxiety of going to a

183
00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:18,620
event a place whatever where there is a very specific like set the order and of operations in which to do things and

184
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:22,320
Feeling like everyone else knows exactly what that is

185
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:28,840
Except me and the chances that I will get in a wrong line go in a wrong door sit in the wrong seat

186
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:34,280
whatever and even just gently be corrected by another human adult and

187
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:38,240
Melting to an Alex Mack puddle of shame is so high

188
00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:44,400
That it has stopped me from going to many a fancy art auction, which I'm definitely invited to all the time

189
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:48,320
I would say two things one. There's always a chance

190
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:54,120
That as soon as the auction concludes and you just bought it for a billion dollars or whatever

191
00:15:54,120 --> 00:16:02,520
That then the painting frame is actually a shredder like the like Banksy did that one time and it shreds up the painting

192
00:16:02,520 --> 00:16:04,520
And you'll be like, huh? I

193
00:16:04,520 --> 00:16:07,960
Guess I guess I can't buy that one. It's all torn top now

194
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:10,600
Got me nice

195
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:13,840
It up and by the way Banksy had to be in the room didn't he?

196
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:19,680
Like how did how was everybody's first read as soon as that auction closed and the thing fell down through the shutter?

197
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:25,880
Everybody wasn't like shut the fucking doors lock it down. Nobody's gone until we find out which one of you is Banksy

198
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:30,200
Hey, everybody real quick raise your hand if you're Banksy got you

199
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:34,040
Shouldn't raise my hands

200
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:41,080
Okay, listen not for show but try something talk to over here. We should do like a cozy mystery where

201
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:49,080
It's locked in in it right after that and the people in there all the fancy people have to figure out who's Banksy

202
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:53,760
Box me out of that when it was my idea. Well, you might not Banksy Griffin

203
00:16:55,000 --> 00:17:02,320
Justin and I definitely weren't there. We read a lot of mysteries. Yeah. No, I'm I only read sports magazines

204
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:07,560
You want to do a cozy sports mystery? We could all work on that together. You know, I'll do that myself

205
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:13,760
I guess with with dad and my fellow sports fan here. This is I I had a second bit

206
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:18,400
I had it. I had a part. Oh my thing. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, which is that um

207
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:20,920
Y'all know how I feel about

208
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
Banksy shoplifting. Oh

209
00:17:23,840 --> 00:17:26,880
This isn't even this isn't even that right?

210
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:30,960
It's not like you're taking the painting and leaving without paying for it

211
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:36,260
If you do accidentally spend a million dollars on the thing and then it doesn't self shred

212
00:17:36,260 --> 00:17:37,220
you

213
00:17:37,220 --> 00:17:39,220
Can just stand up and be like, oh

214
00:17:39,580 --> 00:17:45,540
Whoops and walk out leave. They're not gonna stop legally binding. This is true. Are you Travis you have no

215
00:17:46,940 --> 00:17:53,620
Absolutely, no idea. That's true. That is very true. But the idea of my heart tells me it can't be

216
00:17:57,100 --> 00:18:02,620
Unless you're signing the equivalent of like a liability like waiver when you go into an auction

217
00:18:02,620 --> 00:18:08,100
That's just like if I wave my hand at the wrong time. I definitely have to pay you a million dollars to go to jail

218
00:18:08,100 --> 00:18:10,100
But even that Travis even that

219
00:18:10,980 --> 00:18:15,500
Even that I can still just stand up and leave anytime. That's true

220
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:22,620
There are so few places in this world that you can't just not oops stand up walk out

221
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,740
Prison is the only one I got big. Oh, this is about it

222
00:18:25,740 --> 00:18:33,340
Um, the um, and a locked room mystery. Those are the two I can think of I just had this moment of like imagine

223
00:18:33,340 --> 00:18:36,620
I could really imagining as fun as it sounds to be in this scenario

224
00:18:36,620 --> 00:18:42,500
I just imagined like showing up at one of these and I got all dressed and just walking in the door and just the

225
00:18:42,780 --> 00:18:44,540
overwhelming like

226
00:18:44,540 --> 00:18:45,820
so

227
00:18:45,820 --> 00:18:47,820
The signs do I go get?

228
00:18:47,860 --> 00:18:53,420
Yes, thank a table over there or they got the chairs or is there a specific sign?

229
00:18:53,420 --> 00:18:56,980
I mean like I wouldn't even make it in this far. I would be gone already

230
00:18:56,980 --> 00:19:02,740
I would think you know what? I like, you know what? I like sometimes I end up at these for like Sydney's functions

231
00:19:02,980 --> 00:19:04,980
Sometimes there's a silent

232
00:19:07,100 --> 00:19:09,620
Love a silent one loved a scope for deals

233
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:16,520
Someone brought a basket that they thought would fetch a high price and no one's bidding on it. Maybe I scoop in there

234
00:19:16,520 --> 00:19:23,120
Oh, yeah. Yeah, get a look get a get a knife then you get your hover going where it's just like it's value to 250

235
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:27,780
I put down like eight bucks. No one signed. Yeah, I'm just gonna stand by it. Oh, you're gonna bid on that

236
00:19:27,780 --> 00:19:30,820
I wouldn't if I read you wouldn't this is your name

237
00:19:34,980 --> 00:19:36,980
They don't want to carry that basket of

238
00:19:39,340 --> 00:19:41,500
Fancy wines and golf tees home

239
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:48,060
Can you imagine the panic that any one of us any any socially anxious person like ourselves?

240
00:19:48,060 --> 00:19:55,620
Would feel sitting in the seat holding the paddle while the like auctioneer person is scanning the room and you're thinking don't blink

241
00:19:55,820 --> 00:20:02,860
Don't flinch. I can't if I make any move this guy's horny for movement. He's gonna be like what you

242
00:20:04,020 --> 00:20:09,020
Velociraptor for sure. I saw episode curious George one time where George

243
00:20:09,580 --> 00:20:13,380
didn't understand the difference between 10 and 100 and

244
00:20:14,260 --> 00:20:16,700
Accident because he's a fucking monkey guys

245
00:20:16,700 --> 00:20:19,940
Yeah, every moment of his life is a miracle

246
00:20:21,980 --> 00:20:24,860
Holds him actually way too accountable if you see

247
00:20:25,420 --> 00:20:28,860
Everyone's like George Warren is like he's a fucking monkey guys

248
00:20:29,300 --> 00:20:32,740
Hold the yellow-hatted man the yellow-hatted man brought him back

249
00:20:32,740 --> 00:20:37,460
There's a Christmas special that basically boils down to the yellow hat man screaming at him

250
00:20:37,460 --> 00:20:43,200
Tell me what you want for Christmas, it's like it's a monkey dog. He wants banana

251
00:20:44,620 --> 00:20:49,060
He wants to go back to the fucking jungle where no one judges him for being curious

252
00:20:49,060 --> 00:20:52,460
But anyway, somebody who can't leave anytime he wants there's George

253
00:20:52,460 --> 00:20:54,780
There's an episode where he doesn't know difference between 10 and 100

254
00:20:54,780 --> 00:21:02,740
He accidentally like spends a hundred dollars at an auction for some mittens and the man in yellow hat is like I'm fucking ruined

255
00:21:03,860 --> 00:21:05,820
2022 and he's like a docent

256
00:21:05,820 --> 00:21:11,660
He doesn't have that kind of case just floating around and so what they have to do is they find

257
00:21:12,100 --> 00:21:17,340
Like a rich old weirdo that then they sell the gloves to for $100

258
00:21:17,980 --> 00:21:23,700
So why so you accidentally buy this painting for let's say

259
00:21:24,620 --> 00:21:27,980
$15,000 and you're like, oh fuck and they'll be like, all right, come on up bring your checkbook

260
00:21:28,220 --> 00:21:35,100
You go up to the microphone and be like actually everyone the auctions still going now. I'm auctioning it

261
00:21:35,100 --> 00:21:37,740
Oh right around we're gonna start at

262
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:43,260
$15,000, but I'm gonna do a way better job of selling this thing than this fucking chuckle clown

263
00:21:44,060 --> 00:21:48,940
If you are in the middle of the auction and it's like going once can you beg wait timeout timeout?

264
00:21:48,940 --> 00:21:52,520
Come on, and you go over to the person you're bidding against you're like, do you want to split it?

265
00:21:52,660 --> 00:21:55,460
Like I'll give you get it on Mondays and Wednesdays

266
00:21:55,460 --> 00:22:00,860
I'm out you bid $1 over what I said and I'll give you a dollar like well

267
00:22:00,860 --> 00:22:06,460
We'll just call it you have it at my price. I'll give you a dollar over please. Hey, please

268
00:22:06,820 --> 00:22:11,420
Please don't you and I bid as a goof and hey, why are you laughing?

269
00:22:11,500 --> 00:22:18,500
This is my fucking life. I have I work at a bank. I don't have this money man. Come on

270
00:22:19,940 --> 00:22:21,940
Hey, do y'all want to

271
00:22:21,940 --> 00:22:29,320
Approach the wizard. I'd love to Griff. Okay. This one was sent in by Jennifer. Thank you Jennifer the Wizards familiar

272
00:22:29,320 --> 00:22:30,900
Jennifer

273
00:22:30,900 --> 00:22:38,300
And it's a wiki how article called how to become a loving and caring Pokemon trainer with your plush. Yes, wait with your

274
00:22:39,020 --> 00:22:41,020
plush with your plush

275
00:22:41,140 --> 00:22:44,180
your plush your plush Pokemon, I don't think plush is like

276
00:22:45,260 --> 00:22:46,780
some sort of

277
00:22:46,780 --> 00:22:51,340
Like Gen Z slang for a sexual partner or something like that

278
00:22:51,660 --> 00:22:55,420
Because I don't even know how that sentence would make any sense if that is the case

279
00:22:55,420 --> 00:23:01,680
Mm-hmm. So you're a devoted Pokemon fan, right? Yeah, and you want to have a physical part of the game in your life

280
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:04,420
Yep. Well, this article is gonna show you how with a Pokemon plush

281
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:06,640
Okay

282
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:13,480
Step one making it real start out by getting your first or second Pokemon plush. Wait. Yeah, I don't know

283
00:23:14,680 --> 00:23:16,880
Like what is the first?

284
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:20,880
Oh, maybe you already have your first one and you're like I didn't make that one real enough. Yeah

285
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:27,200
Oh, I chewed way too much on my first one. It is so it is so heavy with my slobber

286
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:32,760
There is I have to get a fresh one to start. I can't imbue it with any kind of reality at this point

287
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:36,800
This will be your companion for the rest of your journey. You should make sure you will love them forever

288
00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:42,000
So choose a plush Pokemon character you like and in the picture here, they have chosen

289
00:23:42,520 --> 00:23:45,120
What I can only describe as an off-brand

290
00:23:46,280 --> 00:23:47,960
noseless Pikachu

291
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:51,760
So I don't want they don't they don't need that extra the IP loss

292
00:23:52,360 --> 00:23:57,640
This isn't a branded partnership between Pokemon and wiki. Oh, yeah

293
00:23:58,600 --> 00:24:02,760
Nicknames are important because that is what your Pokemon will go by it may be determined by gender

294
00:24:02,760 --> 00:24:07,920
But some Pokemon don't have gender so choose something that fits them best. That's cool. What plush would you guys pick?

295
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:15,160
Probably I mean mega Rayquaza has the highest stats still of all that's not the right

296
00:24:15,160 --> 00:24:22,200
Oh, come on about you Justin. Okay. Wow. Well Travis you're you are famously the Pokemon expert of the family. So

297
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:24,240
ghostly

298
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:26,240
No, it's Evie. I

299
00:24:27,160 --> 00:24:28,800
mean that's so that's

300
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:33,360
A lot of funnier name in Pokemon. Maybe we can Evie's the best one Evie has so much potential

301
00:24:33,560 --> 00:24:35,200
What will it be? That's up to me?

302
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:39,400
Whatever I nickname it and Pokemon go and to cure is a dog. Is it a fox?

303
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:42,280
Oh, do you mean two of the cutest animals on earth fucking dog?

304
00:24:42,280 --> 00:24:44,400
Travis just listen

305
00:24:45,160 --> 00:24:47,880
Listen with your listening ears nicknames are important

306
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:52,800
I do want to say that I've played quite a few Pokemon games with Henry and he has a delightful way of nicknaming Pokemon

307
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:58,400
Which is that he wants them to have the strongest sounding name ever and so every Pokemon that we catch we caught one

308
00:24:58,760 --> 00:25:03,760
As it was a legendary Pokemon in his defense, but he did call it king of gods, which felt

309
00:25:06,760 --> 00:25:08,760
Yeah, fuck yeah, dude

310
00:25:08,760 --> 00:25:15,080
The same naming convention is like Godzilla movies and I love that and then make your trainer name

311
00:25:15,080 --> 00:25:19,000
This is what your Pokemon will call you. I have Griffin is fine. Yeah

312
00:25:25,160 --> 00:25:30,240
Making a home find a secret place that pets and siblings can't get to for this will be your Pokemon. So

313
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:33,800
Don't get in my weed Pokemon

314
00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:39,160
Hey, hey ball picks get out of there. You're not ready for that. There's one place like my rotten kids can't reach

315
00:25:39,160 --> 00:25:43,480
So you got to keep an eye on my sash pal. It's daddy's high up stinky shelf. You don't

316
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:48,240
No one gets to know get up. We don't talk about stinky shelf

317
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:49,640
No, no

318
00:25:49,640 --> 00:25:55,400
Get a pillow and a light blanket. The pillow will be the mattress and the blanket will keep them warm

319
00:25:55,400 --> 00:25:58,560
So blanket, I mean, it's a plush doll. Yeah

320
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:03,120
Yeah, so what you were trying to lay on a pillow? That's not comfortable. It's not how about you?

321
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:05,120
Just get a very how much you just get a twin bed

322
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,880
Tiny Casper a baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby

323
00:26:09,080 --> 00:26:14,000
Tempur-pedic like a little one like a little guy. Maybe you find a Tempur-pedic mattress at the mattress store. Bring a knife

324
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:19,520
Cut a little corner off of it. And that's all of a sudden. That's that's a bed for your war turtle

325
00:26:20,520 --> 00:26:22,520
and then food

326
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:30,880
Get some fake food to feed your plush such as clay puffins poke blocks berries and poke puffs or doll food

327
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:35,640
Did you say did you say clay puffins when you meant to say play coffins? Yeah

328
00:26:36,040 --> 00:26:39,320
Yeah, feed your feed your Snorlax some play coffins

329
00:26:40,440 --> 00:26:42,360
Snorlax

330
00:26:42,360 --> 00:26:44,360
Consume he consumes

331
00:26:45,160 --> 00:26:49,680
And so in his favorite food is he just sticks his huge

332
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:55,400
powerful arms deep in the ground and rips coffins out of them and then just but the fun ones

333
00:26:55,400 --> 00:27:02,140
Play coffins the fun play coffins the ones with toys and games on the outside of it and he just fucking eats them

334
00:27:03,020 --> 00:27:06,000
Happy Halloween. I do love the

335
00:27:07,160 --> 00:27:12,640
quick just almost instantaneous abandon abandonment of the concept of

336
00:27:13,080 --> 00:27:16,820
Feed it Pokemon food or just doll food, which I don't know what that is

337
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:23,920
Is that just I'll tell you exactly what that is Griffin. That's the author of the wiki how article realized that you halfway through the sentence

338
00:27:23,920 --> 00:27:31,680
Oh, wait, I just said sibling this person would have to ask their parents to go buy them some clay puffins and some fake bear

339
00:27:31,680 --> 00:27:35,640
You know what anything you got lying around will be fine. Don't ask your parents about this

340
00:27:36,160 --> 00:27:39,240
Don't make a nest out of detritus from your home. This is fine

341
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:43,040
This is you could just draw write the word food on a piece of paper and hand it to the book

342
00:27:43,040 --> 00:27:48,520
What it'll be fine. Don't worry about it. Yeah, the next step is you can spoon feed it to your plush

343
00:27:48,520 --> 00:27:51,900
That's all it says and that is where that is

344
00:27:51,900 --> 00:27:54,640
I mean, I've taken umbrage with a few of the points of this article so far

345
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:59,900
But I do think that if Pokemon was real like I pray to Christ every night and make wishes on stars

346
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:04,880
That that would be my reality

347
00:28:05,880 --> 00:28:07,880
the idea that my

348
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:12,200
considerable Pokemon collection because I'm not gonna be like

349
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:16,040
I'm not gonna be like ash Ketchum out there where it's like, how'd I do this week?

350
00:28:16,040 --> 00:28:22,800
Well, I got a Metapod and that's it like I would be out there like grinding it the fuck out trying to fill out

351
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:24,840
the decks the idea that then like

352
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:26,880
every night

353
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:31,640
My friends would be like hey Griffin come out and party with us and be like I can't I have to spoon feed

354
00:28:32,680 --> 00:28:40,080
Every single one of my Pokemon or they'll they will die just because they go in the little balls doesn't mean that their body functions are

355
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:42,600
Suspended they shit and piss in there

356
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:48,320
They need to eat and plus guys if I don't spoon for you, mr. Mime specifically he gets

357
00:28:49,480 --> 00:28:55,680
Angry, he gets right here. He waits. He wakes me up standing by the side of my bed just pointing at his mouth

358
00:28:55,680 --> 00:29:02,560
That's holding up a spoon. That's another great point. You're gonna have to spoon feed even the dude shaped Pokemon. Yeah

359
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:09,360
That looks like just a tiny blonde woman in a red dress. Yeah, the one that's a duty who moves around

360
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:15,120
Yeah, hit Monchan is just gonna be sitting in front of you and he's gonna try to pick up the fucking spoon with his boxing

361
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:19,760
Gloves, but he can't and so he's just gonna have to sit there like can you please this is so humiliating

362
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:24,280
Goroh's brother may champ is there and he's like feed

363
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:26,880
I'm big go faster

364
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:29,880
Give you a big hug. Yes. Thank you. May champ

365
00:29:31,880 --> 00:29:37,320
Bonding have fun together go to parks take it every place you can't when you can't wait until you can go back home and have

366
00:29:37,320 --> 00:29:39,600
Some extra fun. Just what?

367
00:29:40,520 --> 00:29:46,000
What do you think that means? I don't want to I don't want to go to take it everywhere

368
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:48,320
What Pokemon would you least like this?

369
00:29:49,320 --> 00:29:52,320
What Pokemon would I least like the spoon feed? Yeah

370
00:29:53,040 --> 00:29:55,760
Muck mr. My mind's mr. Mime muck

371
00:29:56,320 --> 00:29:59,240
Muck muck and or his terrible

372
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:05,080
Little brother Grimer one of those two a lowland variant traditional muck. Whatever man

373
00:30:05,080 --> 00:30:09,960
I do the last thing that I need is a living pile of slime in my house bigger than I am

374
00:30:09,960 --> 00:30:15,160
We just I spilled coffee on these carpets that we had put in when we moved into this house in DC

375
00:30:15,160 --> 00:30:18,960
And it that's like there forever and I have to struggle with that every time I look down

376
00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:24,200
At below my desk I see the big brown stain there and it looks like it could be dookie

377
00:30:24,200 --> 00:30:27,120
And I know that like my friends are gonna see my cool office and be like wait a minute

378
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:33,240
Is that dookie the the idea that I would invite a big slime monster in my house who would do not only destroy my carpets

379
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:35,840
And get all my stuff all sticky. He would be like

380
00:30:37,240 --> 00:30:44,080
Mike sucks. I don't want any part of that. I was recently made aware of the punk of the Pokemon

381
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:49,320
Throw. Yeah, who looks like just a large man in a karate gi

382
00:30:49,400 --> 00:30:54,000
Yeah, and the idea of this just like guy looming over me like just

383
00:30:54,000 --> 00:31:00,980
Just opening itself and me having to spoon feed this giant in a human karate gi

384
00:31:01,080 --> 00:31:02,440
Yeah, it's like that

385
00:31:02,440 --> 00:31:05,440
I'd rather have a slime monster in my house

386
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:10,880
So I'm just like that's a monster in my house that I have to appease as opposed to just a needy roommate

387
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:13,100
Yeah, it's a man. Justin. Did you have one?

388
00:31:14,040 --> 00:31:19,960
No, I said mr. Mime. I I I don't like mr. Mime. I don't like the way mr. Mime looks. Yeah

389
00:31:19,960 --> 00:31:26,840
I don't like he has anything about his name. He has a title like it like he his name is mister

390
00:31:26,840 --> 00:31:30,940
It implies he has a first name. Yeah, mr. Mr. Jeremy Mime

391
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:33,760
I

392
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:39,680
Recently found out about Mimikyu and I don't like that one at all either. Yeah, Travis. Have you seen Mimikyu?

393
00:31:39,680 --> 00:31:44,120
No, maybe a long way. I can I can show you Mimikyu. Hold on. I can't believe it

394
00:31:44,120 --> 00:31:50,440
You guys are sending each other Pokemon JPEGs in the background. This is this legit. This is what you dreamed Griff. Yeah, it's like a

395
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:53,600
It's like it. Oh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. No, no, no

396
00:31:53,600 --> 00:32:00,260
I feel like if a little monster killed Pikachu and yeah skin and then wore it. I'm Pikachu now pika me

397
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:05,120
Have have sleepovers. It's fun and you can invite your friends and socialize probably not obviously

398
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:07,480
I think we all sleep below my Pokemon shelf tonight

399
00:32:08,120 --> 00:32:11,980
Cool, cool. It's super sturdy. My dad put it in real good

400
00:32:11,980 --> 00:32:18,580
He said we could have the different shelves too because I don't have that many Pokemon yet. Also keep your grades over. Mr.

401
00:32:18,580 --> 00:32:20,580
Mom, I'm bugging with you

402
00:32:21,260 --> 00:32:24,220
Yeah, it doesn't say to keep your grades up but obviously implied

403
00:32:25,940 --> 00:32:29,180
Hey, you gotta stop hanging out with mr. Mime he's a bad influence on you

404
00:32:30,500 --> 00:32:32,500
Don't listen to that asshole

405
00:32:34,180 --> 00:32:36,180
If you don't have enough badges

406
00:32:36,300 --> 00:32:39,460
Pokemon will not listen to the shit that you say and I love that

407
00:32:39,460 --> 00:32:43,100
I think that's a great if you have a Pokemon that's stronger than

408
00:32:43,460 --> 00:32:50,380
You are as a person and you don't have a badge that boat was like get the fuck it use hydro pump fuck off

409
00:32:50,860 --> 00:32:56,340
You're not my dad. I went to college. I went to college blast toys is my dad

410
00:32:56,380 --> 00:33:00,180
You're just you're just Griffin a dude who threw a ball at me

411
00:33:00,500 --> 00:33:03,360
Once and now you get to tell me exactly what to do

412
00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:09,620
And I was pretty drunk on berries at the time which seems unfair. I do not think this is a fair arrangement

413
00:33:10,140 --> 00:33:13,280
Anyway, let me out of the ball. That's how to become a loving

414
00:33:13,940 --> 00:33:16,900
Pokemon loving and caring Pokemon trainer with your plush

415
00:33:17,700 --> 00:33:21,700
Alright, let's uh, let's take a quick break. We'll be right back after this

416
00:33:21,700 --> 00:33:23,700
This

417
00:33:32,140 --> 00:33:36,980
Would anyone like to do very would you like to hear a very professional ad read? Yeah

418
00:33:40,260 --> 00:33:44,140
Hi, my name is Justin McElroy and when I'm out podcasting

419
00:33:44,140 --> 00:33:51,740
I don't have time to build a lot of websites my kids and their friends. They all come to me the tech dad and

420
00:33:52,500 --> 00:33:58,020
I don't have time to build them each a website about the different things that they like like puppet toys or Pringles

421
00:33:58,060 --> 00:34:01,820
So luckily there is for busy dads like me Squarespace

422
00:34:01,980 --> 00:34:03,980
They will make whatever

423
00:34:03,980 --> 00:34:10,580
Website that your kids want you to make in a fast way that it won't look like you did it though because they have world-class

424
00:34:10,580 --> 00:34:16,120
Templates created by the best designers the best people in the game easy

425
00:34:16,120 --> 00:34:21,020
And if you can't figure it out, there's got the the best customer service in the business

426
00:34:22,300 --> 00:34:24,140
24-7

427
00:34:24,140 --> 00:34:26,060
Hey, sorry, just real quick

428
00:34:26,060 --> 00:34:31,700
Can I give you a couple notes as you're going one when you said Ted dad made you sound like you're a robotic dad

429
00:34:32,220 --> 00:34:35,940
We actually love that if you could lean into that a little harder with some good angle

430
00:34:35,940 --> 00:34:41,740
Simpsons also you are kind of making it sound like you tell Squarespace what kind of website your kids run and they'll build

431
00:34:42,300 --> 00:34:44,300
And that is not the service

432
00:34:45,340 --> 00:34:47,660
So that's just a quick note from

433
00:34:49,260 --> 00:34:51,260
Actually, I wish you'd let me finish the copy

434
00:34:52,740 --> 00:34:56,460
Yeah, please but do leaning to the robot dad thing, okay, listen

435
00:34:57,180 --> 00:35:00,980
Travis no more notes. Let me finish. They're just reading what's what's here on the page

436
00:35:00,980 --> 00:35:06,220
Okay, like a lot of cybernetic dads whose hearts have been replaced with oil. I don't have the time to build

437
00:35:06,660 --> 00:35:10,900
Websites for my kids and neither the Squarespace a lot of people get confused about this

438
00:35:11,300 --> 00:35:16,120
This ad is to clarify that the cyber dads are the ones building the sites

439
00:35:16,380 --> 00:35:23,540
The Squarespace is just metaphorically speaking the oil on their lubes and gears and typing ones

440
00:35:24,380 --> 00:35:28,180
so I mean if you're not sold already then

441
00:35:28,180 --> 00:35:31,020
the oil in your heart has gone stayed

442
00:35:31,900 --> 00:35:33,900
because

443
00:35:33,900 --> 00:35:36,080
Like that more tech that stuff

444
00:35:37,500 --> 00:35:42,060
Squarespace is the best way to make a website. That's the that's the really serious

445
00:35:43,140 --> 00:35:46,060
Really solemn part about all this so head to squarespace.com

446
00:35:46,580 --> 00:35:51,200
Slash my brother for a free trial and when you're ready to launch use offer code my brother

447
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:55,300
To save 10% off your first purchase or a website or domain

448
00:35:55,300 --> 00:35:57,740
Justin I love that you read it word-for-word

449
00:35:57,740 --> 00:36:00,620
I especially like how you hit the note that they put in here

450
00:36:00,620 --> 00:36:04,340
That was like when you get to the part about how Squarespace is definitely the best

451
00:36:04,780 --> 00:36:09,020
Place to build the website get really solemn and serious about it. Bring it down

452
00:36:09,100 --> 00:36:15,860
That's the part we want to make sure you drive home like you're asking for money for hungry kids. Good job. Okay. Okay, perfect

453
00:36:16,940 --> 00:36:23,780
Bombas make socks and clothes and underwear and that's clothes shirts is also clothes

454
00:36:23,780 --> 00:36:25,780
and

455
00:36:25,940 --> 00:36:28,140
I think that's pretty badass

456
00:36:30,420 --> 00:36:34,540
