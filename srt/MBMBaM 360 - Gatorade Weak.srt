1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:30,800
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:48,880
Hello everybody and welcome to My Brother, My Brother and Me, an advice show for the modern

6
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:53,840
era. I'm your oldest brother Justin Tyler McElroy. I'm your middle-est brother Travis P. McElroy.

7
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:58,000
I'm your sweet baby brother and 30 under 30 media luminary Griffin McElroy A.

8
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:04,560
A is my middle. A is my middle initial. Turn around every now and then I get a little bit

9
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:16,800
nervous. My Brother, My Brother and Me 360. We've done it. We're all the way back at the start.

10
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:26,480
So it's like a geometry joke. Okay, so we've circled back around or like a fully immersive

11
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:34,720
interactive experience. Well, it's both Travis. We're back to the beginning, which means

12
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:41,360
just a lot. We're just going to use challenging terminology for everybody that isn't a straight

13
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:49,680
white dude. What's the audio quality going to be like, you ask? Oh, it will be unlistenable.

14
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:55,920
It's gonna be hard. Yeah, it'll be hard to recreate that. I'm gonna go put my expensive

15
00:01:55,920 --> 00:02:00,800
mic sort of dip it in a toilet for a bit and then continue using it. I should recreate sort

16
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:06,800
of the original WAV files I was producing. Back at the beginning as if we never left My Brother,

17
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:11,280
My Brother and Me the beginning. What was that? Hey, here's a trivia question for you.

18
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:16,480
What was the first question ever on My Brother, My Brother and Me?

19
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:23,840
Was it shampoo and a shower? Yeah, maybe. You don't know. You shouldn't have asked it if you

20
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:30,000
didn't know it. I shouldn't have asked it if I didn't know it. I completely agree. Now Justin,

21
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:35,040
where does the 360 immersive like fully VR experience? That's what I want to know about.

22
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:42,400
Can I plug this into my fucking Google cardboard that came with my New Yorker magazine and be in

23
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:48,400
it be in the room be in the studio turn to my left see the big big box of sickness tissues I've

24
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:52,800
got going look to my right and see the I've got a roll of toilet paper over here just in case I run

25
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:56,880
out of sickness issues. Can people experience this at real time in their Google cardboard?

26
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:05,840
That's the plan. We're still the tech is still sort of in its in a nebulous infancy. We've got

27
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:11,680
until tomorrow to figure it out because we're recording on Sunday. So getting the 360 experience

28
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:17,040
I think is obviously the biggest challenge we're facing currently. Well maybe we can maybe we can

29
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:23,200
like audio it a little bit and I can say like well right now to my right I'm recording on my desktop

30
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:30,560
but to my left I'm shopping on Amazon for Father's Day presents for myself and I'm eyeballing the

31
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:36,160
portable air conditioner I had to turn off so as not to actually make it sound like our first 10

32
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:42,400
episodes right yeah and every second that takes by makes me sweat more and more it was the air

33
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:48,640
conditioner saying all the problematic stuff yeah that air conditioner oh boy I've got the AC and

34
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:56,640
definitely not PC yeah I've got the first question you ready yeah my brother my brother comes to us

35
00:03:56,640 --> 00:04:03,440
from the potato the underscore potato on Twitter god that sounds bad yes I want a larger follower

36
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:08,640
account but I'm finding it difficult to get more than two in a day this was our can I do start a

37
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:14,320
bunch of accounts and have them follow each other oh that was a good one good job good job question

38
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:22,480
fucking social media like acumen that was really what we fucking kicked it off with hey listen we

39
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:29,280
did okay I mean like you can't you I do I did have a lot fewer followers than I do now so something

40
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:38,000
here is probably pretty good um what are you all boys doing for dad's day I'm gonna play um a lot

41
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:45,680
of computer games and for one brief hour pretend like my life now isn't at the whim of my seven

42
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:50,720
month old daughter and that I can actually make decisions for myself I'm trying to get to that

43
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:57,440
captain underpants oh yes I'm trying to get over there another dreamworks franchise I want to

44
00:04:57,440 --> 00:05:03,120
celebrate the entire sort of company output um I gotta get over there I tried to get over try to

45
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:08,240
get over there and my excitement I had two big buckets of popcorn two big puppets and you know

46
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:11,680
I kicked the door open into the theater and they asked me to leave right there and then so maybe

47
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:17,520
I'll try again a little more subdued contain a little bit contain it who's your do you guys want

48
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:22,560
to talk about a dad that's important to you not our dad obviously because it's the easy one but

49
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:28,960
a dad that's important to you like in media or like in real life like my friend steve's dad or

50
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:34,000
something I mean if whatever you want to do a dad's important to you it's the only sort of but

51
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:39,280
not our dad no no no I mean our dad's the most important dad he's a great dad and a very special

52
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:43,760
father but I feel like we talk about him and his funny injuries every father's day like it's time

53
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:48,240
to cut his butt open use a maxi pad it's a big bandage you know basic stories like that still

54
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:54,000
be on those phones though there's still me well no not on his butt bones because the the I believe

55
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:59,200
it was a window screen cut him wide open butt fell right off so dad that's important to us now

56
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:03,600
on our dad who poured kitty litter and bleached down a drain and knocked himself out for several

57
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:06,640
hours right right right right right right it's convenient about the it's convenient about the

58
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:11,600
butt thing he puts his wallet in that side of his pants he sits normal now it all bounces out

59
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:17,120
because some of the butt fell out when he cut himself right right that was yes I'll start I

60
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:29,280
guess dave hester from storage wars we get to see some of that relationship unfold and entangle on

61
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:38,880
the show with dave jr and I don't know I mean not a traditional great dad I guess um but he has he

62
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:44,560
has a catchphrase and everybody loves that for a good dad and you know passes on business acumen

63
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:50,640
passes on the family business at all times I am I am I am fucking rolling on that suda

64
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:56,640
so fucking hard I'm on that suda 51 so hard that like I'm being hypnotized watching my own

65
00:06:56,640 --> 00:07:01,760
waveforms appear on the screen in front of me it's gonna be a fun record I want to talk about Dave

66
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:09,840
Thomas okay wait which founder founder of Wendy's America's dad uh here's some cool he wants to

67
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:17,840
know some cool fucking things about Dave Thomas oh yeah uh he was he was adopted he started a

68
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:25,840
foundation for adoption um he worked at Kentucky Fried Chicken and the colonel tried to lure him

69
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:35,440
into um a tryst a big pan a big pit full hamburgers and he was like you know me too well

70
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:43,840
colonel no he was he was uh uh he he listen he founded Wendy's this is huge agreed found

71
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:50,640
a Wendy's in Columbus Ohio go to the first Wendy's I think it's closed now but um found the

72
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:58,240
first Wendy's extremely successful but didn't graduate from college right get this he quit high

73
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:05,040
school uh in fact he didn't even finish high school but he found just a rose that keeps blooming

74
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:12,560
I know but get this you ready yeah he was so successful after dropping out of high school

75
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:18,320
he was worried that people would use him as an example for why you shouldn't finish high school

76
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:25,280
so he went back to high school in like yeah in 1993 he went to coconut creek high school

77
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:31,200
after founding Wendy's this motherfucker went back to high school it's great got his GED it's amazing

78
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:37,040
let me pop right in can I get can I pop into the cut real quick whatever you got is it about how

79
00:08:37,040 --> 00:08:44,080
he how he didn't wait for the draft of the Korean War he volunteered for the army well that yeah

80
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:50,800
now did he have kid did he have a kid did he have children he had four children okay

81
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:55,200
I just want to pop in I just want to pop in there because we are talking about great dads

82
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:59,200
and he's America's dad he's the father of the Wendy's franchise and he's father

83
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:04,640
of of he's like a a surrogate father to kids that want to quit high school yeah and then find out

84
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:09,280
that um and here's just another factoid this isn't really related but he made a cameo appearance as

85
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:14,160
himself in bionic ever after a reunion tv movie based on the six million dollar man and the bionic

86
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:20,000
woman so that's kind of a cool thing about Dave Thomas and that would be I do not have any context

87
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:25,280
for that scene but I'm assuming it's a pretty cool scene yeah if for some reason Dave Thomas shows

88
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:30,720
up as himself I cannot fathom what happens in that scene but I'm very excited that it exists

89
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:37,840
do we know anything about Dave Thomas's politics oh Jesus hold on um I mean he was rich so that

90
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:42,560
probably didn't not great maybe but I don't know I don't know about his personal politics

91
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:46,880
I'm not here to talk about Dave Thomas's politics I'm here to talk about how he went back to high

92
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:52,880
school to inspire kids to finish school I think that's inspiring uh looks like he's pro-choice

93
00:09:52,880 --> 00:10:03,280
he's not anything he's passed away but the fine um so advice so this is an advice show and um

94
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:08,080
we help people with the real issues that are going on in their lives back in the early days

95
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:12,640
we used to do a lot of like benign shit you know what I mean because we were afraid to get our toes

96
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:20,400
into some hot water um but with it's 360 so now we're back around to really um well soak in these

97
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:27,600
toes soaking these toes in the hot water like race sex politics nothing's off limits because this is

98
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:35,200
my brother my brother he 360 here's our first question how much cream cheese should I put

99
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:42,240
on my bagel and that's from cream cheese confounded um and it's you know what

100
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:48,400
it's a pretty good question yeah I guess so it differs from where you go to where you aren't

101
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:52,000
it's because you go to an airport and you get a bagel at an airport and they give you

102
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:59,920
a thimble a borrower full of cream cheese the littlest cup but you go to a new york deli hey

103
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:06,080
they get fucking crazy it's like they've got a bunch of cream cheese and it's like

104
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:11,680
brewster's million style they have to get rid of all of it in order to win the treasure or something

105
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:17,760
here's the thing when it comes to cream I see four options with your cream cheese application

106
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:23,360
hold on you faxed me over a chart here let me yeah listen I put a lot of thought all right

107
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:29,200
I'm reviewing it option a you have your open face cream cheese on both sides of the bagel option

108
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:35,920
right two different halves both of them cream cheesed option b you put cream cheese on one

109
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:42,640
half you make a sandwich out of it option c cream cheese on both half sandwich out of it this is

110
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:48,160
double cream cheese you're gonna dribble and it's gonna be you're gonna get a lot of like

111
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:55,120
is that cum no it's not it's cream cheese I did it I got I flew too close to the to the bagel sun

112
00:11:55,120 --> 00:12:03,920
and option option four and this is my preferred option just a container whatever a big lump of

113
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:09,120
cream cheese whatever a dollop of cream cheese however you prefer to measure it out and then

114
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:15,440
you break off pieces of the bagel there we go scoop the cream cheese with it that is your

115
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:22,480
cream cheese palette and you will dip your brush and then spread it into the canvas of your mouth

116
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:28,160
correct I I think that cream cheese is actually a pretty good measure for where you're at as a

117
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:35,360
grown-up oh when I was a little kid no cream cheese butter and jam for me please mother butter

118
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:42,880
and jam and then maybe a scoop of clotted cream as I got a little older I had basically the thinnest

119
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:48,560
possible layer of cream cheese and then as I got even older and I started to appreciate that gooey

120
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:53,520
salty cheese I started thinking like I could take a little bit more of this I can handle some more

121
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:58,640
and so I would be eating a bagel with a pretty substantial amount of cream cheese and then from

122
00:12:58,640 --> 00:13:03,760
out of nowhere some adult like a real grown-up would walk past me and be like you know some of

123
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:08,000
us are putting locks on it and it's like I'll never get there I'm never gonna get to a point

124
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:12,080
where like oh that's a good amount cream cheese maybe a fillet of brine salmon on top of that

125
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:17,280
you know they're doing some capers on there too which are just I cannot fuck with capers in any

126
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:22,000
way but like to think of a breakfast where I'm gonna put a fillet of brine salmon on my cream

127
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:27,840
cheese no way it's unthinkable it's unthinkable it's unimaginable I'll fuck with some mocks though

128
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:33,200
I don't know why I said it's oh I think about it a lot and capers are really just like olives that

129
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:40,400
couldn't quite get there huh it is tiny salty just like little uh you know like pop rocks

130
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:46,880
only for salt instead of sugar that's what caper is they're just weird sick peanuts yes if you

131
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:57,120
really unpack it um I prefer Travis's method it's just like I have um some tooth problems bottom

132
00:13:57,120 --> 00:14:02,080
left my the whole bottom left quadrant of my mouth just doesn't behave I've gone to see the dentist

133
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:06,720
dentist says it's all made up and I say it's he says you're just thinking too hard about it just

134
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:11,840
to eat your eat your fucking food uh it's all goofed up and so every bite of food I take is is

135
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:18,240
it's it's precious because it could be the last so I want to perfectly measure out each perfect bite

136
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:24,240
every bite of bagel that I take is like a little amuse bouche and I just have a hundred of them

137
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:29,280
and it's perfectly creamed and I'm good I'm good to go I'm ready to go anytime I have the opportunity

138
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:34,880
to do that with my food I will chase it anytime I have the opportunity to have a sort of dunkaroo

139
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:40,400
method I'm going I am going to chase that 100 percent of the time you touched on this Griffin

140
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:46,800
but I would like to circle back around when I'm getting deli in New York like a New York like they

141
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:59,600
say a bow bow hey what is what you know how they do it yeah what is with the the literal like down

142
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:06,000
comforter of cream cheese that I have to like nosh through to get to the bagel inside what is

143
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:11,440
going on over there it makes it makes me think that you're supposed to take some of it off and

144
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:16,000
save it for later like it's like this is for tomorrow's we don't we don't know if you have

145
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:20,480
cream cheese at home so this is for tomorrow's and possibly the day after that's bagels it's a three

146
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:26,640
day cheese well what most people don't realize about the economy of New York City is the like

147
00:15:26,640 --> 00:15:31,760
the cost of living is very high like a beer is like twenty dollars and you know like rent is of

148
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:35,520
course very high everybody knows that and it's like twenty dollars yeah right it's like twenty

149
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:40,960
dollars and the sandwich is like twenty dollars and the balance is that cream cheese super cheap

150
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:46,720
like yeah one cent a pound so like that's how they keep like that's how New York is able if

151
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:51,200
you took cream cheese out of the equation everything will become so imbalanced in New

152
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:55,440
York City that it would literally sink hit me with this hit me with this it's a city on the go

153
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:59,120
city on the go city on the move everybody's always always moving and going from business

154
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:02,400
meeting to business never sleeps never never sleeps getting a cab go from one business

155
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:05,600
being the fucking next business meeting you've been home to check on your kids or your dog or

156
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:10,160
whatever and forever they're gone they're gone they're gone they're gone they're on the go too

157
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:14,160

158
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:19,840
this baby stay out that's all it is so listen how come New York's food is like universally

159
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:24,560
a big sloppy mess you can go and get a big wet slice of za and it's gonna dribble and drizzle

160
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:29,840
all over you get a pound of cream cheese between two round boys and that's gonna get all over you

161
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:35,200
you eat a big the coney dogs coney dogs don't get me started there's two different types of dribbling

162
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:39,280
and drizzling that you can do all over yourself what is it you're on the go and you're on the

163
00:16:39,280 --> 00:16:43,440
move and everybody's just fucking sticky and and and wet and covered in condiments all the time

164
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:48,640
what's up New York that's why that's why Griffin they need it as an excuse to stop like that's how

165
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:53,200
you know your day is done in New York it's like well I'm caked in ketchup and cream cheese and

166
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:57,760
syrup and whatever so now it's time now it's time to take a breathe you've been out on the

167
00:16:57,760 --> 00:17:02,400
big streets making mud pies and mom's calling you in for the day exactly you've had enough

168
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:08,240
maybe though let me hit you with this maybe that is you ever heard the term tourist trap

169
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:14,000
maybe it's pretty literal in this sense like oh you ate the food well you're stuck and I can just

170
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:19,440
zip right on past you hey no problem New York more like no fork because they don't use they

177
00:17:55,280 --> 00:18:01,200
building that's why king kong climbed up there to get the tracks yeah he needed that apple

178
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:08,080
it was worth it was worth a thousand bonus points that's fine fine did you not think

179
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:15,760
I'd have an answer for that Justin oh of course of course uh Kevin Zach asks more like Big Snapple

180
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:22,000
it's been a while oh it's been a while I'm glad it's back oh um wow this website's not good

181
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:28,960
Kevin Kevin Zach the man so nice they named him twice asked how do we make apple juice more

182
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:33,520
relevant to adult consumers our company's been pressing apples and making apple juice for

183
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:37,760
generations all of the apple juice we make is Griffin I'm gonna stop you I'm gonna stop you

184
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:46,080
I think you're tripped out on Sudafed we did do this question last week did we no it was brought

185
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:51,040
up in the twofer part at the end of the episode but we didn't do it right but you said the thing

186
00:18:51,040 --> 00:18:55,440
was that just a preview of things to come yeah now we're gonna do it we didn't we didn't talk

187
00:18:55,440 --> 00:19:03,600
about it did we so I don't remember this at all so wait hold on it's been 360 episodes and this

188
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:10,240
is the first one in which Griffin actually said a yahoo last week that we are actually going to

189
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:14,960
talk about the next week that's the way we've always done it this wasn't the final this wasn't

190
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:22,320
the final I'm losing my mind I mean I am too I'm literally not lucid right now um how do we make

191
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:26,160
these fucking juices more relevant to adult consumers it's good it's a good topic do you

192
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:32,800
want to not do it no I do I do I just I wanted to be the human tweet that we were going to get

193
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:38,400
okay Travis McElroy is the human tweet here's the thing do you know what the people love these

194
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:44,560
days can you let me finish the fucking I thought you finished it oh god no you don't you interrupted

195
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:51,440
him you I don't even remember all the apple juice we make is pure uncut shit fucking send you to

196
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:58,320
space all the apple juice we make is pure not from concentrate pressed from local apples and sold

197
00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:02,720
shelf stable not chilled we sell our apple juice in four different pack sizes one liter a best

198
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:11,040
selling format format five pack seven ounce juice boxes and 128 ounce jug and a 46 ounce bottle

199
00:20:11,040 --> 00:20:15,200
primary consumer of apple juice has traditionally been kids concern around the sugar content of

200
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:19,280
juice along with the aging population in the households having fewer kids has led to apple

201
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:23,840
juice declines in recent years apple juice is loaded with health benefits that are irrelevant

202
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:28,400
to adults yet it has never been directly targeted or promoted to them the pure and local nature of

203
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:33,920
our apple juice is on trend with the today's adult consumer note solutions with alcohol are

204
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:38,960
not compatible with our brand so think of something else to say Justin and Travis yeah yeah yeah

205
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:44,400
actually if I could if I could speak on that for a moment uh I went through Taco Bell drive-thru

206
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:49,600
on my way home from the airport because there's not a lot of options and I liked eating it also

207
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:55,680
and um to other I prefer it to other options when many options are presented often that is the one

208
00:20:55,680 --> 00:21:02,160
I prefer to eat with my mouth and uh it's cheat day buzz off anyway I ate there and they have a

209
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:13,440
new option there um that is Mountain Dew spiked I had a moment that I was so fucking excited

210
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:20,320
about Mountain Dew spiked lemonade that Taco Bell finally it's a one-stop shop well you can get

211
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:24,000
everything there at three in the morning now after you've been drinking you can now get

212
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:32,480
drunk drunker yeah and here's the thing it's non-alcoholic and it says you have it says on

213
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:38,080
the sign does not contain alcohol and I just wanted to say to Taco Bell this is sort of like

214
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:44,720
a mini Munch Squad diversion I guess if you have to specify that a product does not contain alcohol

215
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:50,880
maybe it's time to go back to the drawing board on what you named the thing like if you if you

216
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:57,040
were to have like um we've got a new thing it's apple juice with cocaine and then at the bottom

217
00:21:57,040 --> 00:22:03,680
of the screen it says does not contain any actual cocaine it's probably like time for a new name

218
00:22:03,680 --> 00:22:11,120
yeah back to the drawing board here's my idea for apple juice apple juice here's the thing

219
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:17,440
you know what people love these days they like beverages that claim health benefits

220
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:23,760
while also being delicious okay but you can't just say that you can't just be like it's healthy

221
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:28,400
it's got to be like makes your brain more powerful and gives you the energy to have sex good and

222
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:34,800
stuff like it's got to sound extreme like coconut water is a thing just make apple water just call

223
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:40,320
it apple water talk about like it'll make you live to 140 or whatever and you can say whatever

224
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:46,880
you want because by the time people crack down on that we're on to something else just make whatever

225
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:55,520
bogus claims you want it's like a moving target yes I this is what Don Draper would do just

226
00:22:55,520 --> 00:23:00,560
fucking call it like sex juice and tell people when you drink apple juice your boners are better

227
00:23:00,560 --> 00:23:05,840
and you look better and everybody enjoys having sex with you more and you'll go for like sting

228
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:10,880
time and everybody will be impressed with how good you are at sex because you drink some apple juice

229
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:16,640
when you're down to pound get the fruit that's round and now in a bottle it's sex juice it's

230
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:22,560
made entirely from apples and other natural ingredients like pan-x which apparently makes

231
00:23:22,560 --> 00:23:31,360
your wiener bigger learn the secret that bees have known for centuries apples make you better

232
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:38,640
at fucking hey you ever see a horse turn down an apple no you ever see a horse's shlong it's

233
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:46,160
amazing apples definitely make you good at sex and make it bigger and better for you and your

234
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:54,960
loved one you heard it straight from the horse's mouth and then when people are like hey that thing

235
00:23:54,960 --> 00:24:00,400
you said about apples and sex isn't true you say well the horse did say nay it's right in there

236
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:09,440
that's the asterisk could you just put some chunks in there oh my god like orbits like

237
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:16,320
like people love that what's that like bubble tea but instead it's just chunks of apple that you

238
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:21,280
have to sift through i don't love that sort of stuff it's sort of like a virgin sangria is what

239
00:24:21,280 --> 00:24:27,840
you're discussing people love filter feeding yeah they love when they're drinking and then they have

240
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:32,080
to do work yeah and they can push the apple juice out through their baleen you know what i mean and

241
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:40,080
then just keep the chunks and you get a little snack um i tell you what would sell it for me

242
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:46,560
can i tell you and this is a fucking this is foolproof okay on my way to wrestlemania last

243
00:24:46,560 --> 00:24:52,480
year and that's an important part of the story i went to stop to bucky's got a big thing a minute

244
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:58,560
minute time minute time apple juice i think is what it's called and a big big bag of sugar-free

245
00:24:58,560 --> 00:25:05,440
gummy bears and blasted through them both and then they blasted through me with some

246
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:16,640
just chart topping loose stools just just some some real next level stuff um and so like my idea

247
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:23,760
is to have them do some sort of eternal sunshine of the spotless mind on me so that i can ever

248
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:29,040
or because i think here's the thing i think the sugar-free gummy bears are the ones that threw

249
00:25:29,040 --> 00:25:34,000
the party inside of me but the apple juice was certainly a guest of honor and it's going to be

250
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:42,240
hard for me to sort of divorce it from its role in the festivities um so whatever they can do to

251
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:47,920
sort of just get that out of out of my mind um so i can enjoy the taste again i'll take my question

252
00:25:47,920 --> 00:25:55,280
i answer off the air uh real talk those fucking little glass balls also that they had on uh boy

253
00:25:55,280 --> 00:26:00,400
meets world and i think on like martin little glass balls they just pull out of the fridge

254
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:04,880
and i know we've talked about those beautiful globules but like i would drink anything out

255
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:09,520
of those are you kidding me i'd feel like i'm a fucking diablo 2 barbarian just chugging a

256
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:15,200
potion getting ready for battle you know what i mean with your toilet i i think the thing that

257
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:22,480
apple juice is gonna have to overcome is the fact that it is entirely sugar i mean it's just pure

258
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:26,720
sugar and adults are a little more savvy about that like if you want me to drink something like

259
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:31,280
if you want me to drink a 12 ounce glass of apple juice you're probably gonna have to do better than

260
00:26:31,280 --> 00:26:38,880
a fucking half cup of sugar in the bottle of apple juice that i'm consuming that's lunacy

261
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:44,560
yeah no adult's gonna buy that maybe stop making it or you could do like tropic canada's with their

262
00:26:44,560 --> 00:26:49,280
tropican of 50 line and literally just fill half the bottle with water that's what they did and

263
00:26:49,280 --> 00:26:54,880
they're like it's better for you now it's like well i mean yeah yeah yeah in a blend i could

264
00:26:54,880 --> 00:27:00,160
enjoy at home that's why i i've long advocated for gatorade to make a lime that's just called

265
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:06,640
gatorade weak and it's just watered down because sometimes a gatorade is just too much and you pour

266
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:10,480
half of it out and you fill it with the water and it's like ah this is exactly the level of

267
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:16,880
beverage that i desired it's gatorade week it won't it won't help you in sports i love you

268
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:24,560
i love you gatorade g2 is already a thing and that exists and they done did it they done did

269
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:31,840
they gotta go now i do love the idea of gatorade for once sort of toning their brand down instead

270
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:37,760
of just escalating and escalating and escalating until it's just like randy moss eating his way

271
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:43,440
through a car door to get at the gatorade extreme like that is sitting in the the uh sitting in the

272
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:49,600
cup holder inside you're looking pretty down what's that you've got eight sonnets to finish

273
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:54,960
before class tomorrow we'll pound one of these it's gatorade week it's not going to keep you

275
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:05,680
the commercial i see just me sitting on the couch i grab a gatorade i take a sip and my face just

276
00:28:05,680 --> 00:28:12,080
kind of goes like oh and it's like too much we totally hear you sorry about that we put too many

00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:25,440
to my bim bam while i was eating and while i was walking back to work i took off my headphones when

288
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:29,600
i walked to the door and apparently a doctor had been following behind me and asked me what i got

289
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:35,680
from subway okay um i had no idea who this doctor was and i just responded that i got a meatball

290
00:29:35,680 --> 00:29:40,240
sammy he told me his favorite is the chicken teriyaki and continued to tell me that the

291
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:45,360
previous week there was a special where you could get lobster at subway then he just walked away and

292
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:49,360
didn't say anything else i don't know what the hell just happened to me please help that's from

293
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:57,920
confusion cincinnati um you just had a conversation like yeah it's just it's just you may congratulations

294
00:29:57,920 --> 00:30:06,000
i mean you made small talk you made it everybody a deep deep connection i mean he was lying

295
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:13,920
so like i guess that that would be a confusing part he was lying correct oh my god subway did

296
00:30:13,920 --> 00:30:21,760
have a lobster sandwich oh my goodness golly gosh so that's all that happened to you i mean this is

297
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:28,960
more this feels more to less like a question to me and the bim bam 360 kind of about a triumph

298
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:33,680
like i had a conversation with someone i made benign small talk for a couple minutes and then

299
00:30:33,680 --> 00:30:39,120
we parted ways they didn't like what usually happens in our questions like try to sell me

300
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:45,760
a skeleton or grab my butt or whatever like you just had a regular interaction with somebody i

301
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:50,000
think that's glorious but it's not something you need our help with you did it congratulations

302

360 you all finally learned how to fly please teach us when you get a second now you do a

303
00:30:55,920 --> 00:31:01,280
podcast and we'll listen to it what's your favorite subway sammy though i used to fuck

304
00:31:01,280 --> 00:31:07,440
with the chicken bacon ranch but can't 30 39 30 i can't have ranch anymore i had a weird

305
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:12,800
realization the first time i went to a subway that wasn't in huntington west virginia and

306
00:31:12,800 --> 00:31:20,080
tried to find my favorite pizza sub on the menu and not a nationwide experience i think the pizza

307
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:24,240
sub i think you could probably gen one up they just make it there for you you would get that

308
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:27,440
they you came in and ordered it one day and they're like i guess we'll put some marinara

309
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:34,080
on some shit and cheese it and okay here you go little small boy we love you very much

310
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:40,800
very good job i guess that's not a national thing i don't know they're very big in west virginia

311
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:45,520
though i don't know they're every west virginia subway i don't have a favorite i just like walk

312
00:31:45,520 --> 00:31:52,160
in and say surprise me okay they're all good i've never been disappointed i used to this is true

313
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:58,640
back when i was a young man who didn't know better used to get the tuna sub the tuna sub at subway

314
00:31:58,640 --> 00:32:04,320
oh what a mistake that was that's the one that they make with the tuna salad in subway right

315
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:12,560
yeah that's the one that they make begrudgingly are you sure yeah yeah it's sort of a hesitant

316
00:32:12,560 --> 00:32:17,680
scoop that you get on that one uh like you'll get a half scoop of it i'm just trying to limit

317
00:32:17,680 --> 00:32:21,440
the risk here when they go to hand it to you they'll jerk it back click and they're like

318
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:27,600
are we on a prank show please don't do this to us they said you order it and they say ah trying

319
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:33,760
not to get somebody to not sit next to you on the bus today huh very clever there are safer ways to

320
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:50,000
do this sir uh let's get the money some my brother my brother me that's right this podcast is supported

321
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:59,680
in part by casper an online retailer of premium premium obsessively engineered mattresses for a

322
00:32:59,680 --> 00:33:05,200
fraction of the price up the price of what i don't know it's not in the copy point but like think of

323
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:13,520
something else and it's less than that think of a big price no you're wrong or or you might have

324
00:33:13,520 --> 00:33:18,640
thought like sixty dollars and that is too low that's actually come on it's it is a mattress

325
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:24,400
it's like be be fucking serious and don't you like 801 because the person next to you said 800

326
00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:31,920
that's cheap that a fucking oh it's the worst casper uh they the box you get from casper should

327
00:33:31,920 --> 00:33:38,320
not contain a mattress but it does and that's the first sin of casper and it's really there's

328
00:33:38,320 --> 00:33:43,040
several sins though they should not be this cheap that's gluttony i think is one of those

329
00:33:43,040 --> 00:33:49,600
it's our and but and the other sin is they've defied god and made a box too small to hold a

330
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:55,680
mattress that does hold a mattress when you open it just like expands out and the sin is everywhere

331
00:33:55,680 --> 00:34:00,400
it's like what i what i always imagined in cartoons when they like had an emergency raft

332
00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:05,120
and it was like a little envelope and then they pull it unfolds that's basically a casper mattress

333
00:34:05,680 --> 00:34:10,240
um except it's not funny it's just comfort well it does kind of make a funny noise i guess yeah

334
00:34:10,240 --> 00:34:16,880
kind of makes this like so far yeah that's very quiet one though there's a risk-free uh trial and

335
00:34:16,880 --> 00:34:21,040
return policy you're not going to want to do this but you can try sleeping on a casper for 100 days

336
00:34:21,040 --> 00:34:26,240
with free delivery to the us and canada and painless returns now when they say that that's

337
00:34:26,240 --> 00:34:30,320
a lie because you are going to have to stuff it back in that mattress and you're not a wizard

338
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:34,320
so you're going to be at that for the rest of your days um that's not sure i'm sure there's

339
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:37,760
another way of getting the mattress back to them uh and these matches they're made right here in

340
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:44,880
the good old us of a our listeners can get 50 towards any mattress purchase if they go to

00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:10,800
here they huge vape rigs yeah yeah hey guys this is adam conover you may know me from my true tv

385
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:15,120
show adam ruins everything well guess what now we're doing a podcast version right here on

386
00:39:15,120 --> 00:39:19,200
maximum fun what we do is we take all the interesting fascinating experts that we talked

387
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:23,920
to for just a couple minutes on the show and we sit with them for an entire podcast really going

388
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:28,640
deep and getting into the fascinating details of their work find adam ruins everything wherever

389
00:39:28,640 --> 00:39:35,040
you get your podcasts or at maximum fun.org how about yahoo yeah that would go down real smooth

390
00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:41,680
right now this one was sent in by ryan p fahmy thank you ryan it's yahoo answers user no name

391
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:48,000
that is their name i don't know why um should i invent a contraption that only the very smart

392
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:54,000
sperm cells are able to make it through will this make future generations smarter i am a scientist

393
00:39:56,160 --> 00:40:01,840
i am a scientist i therefore want to invent some sort of maze that sperm cells have to move through

394
00:40:01,840 --> 00:40:07,040
the problem with this maze is that only the most intelligent sperm cells will be able to make it

395
00:40:07,040 --> 00:40:11,120
through this maze therefore since only the most intelligent sperm cells will make it through the

396
00:40:11,120 --> 00:40:16,000
maze the egg will only be fertilized by the most intelligent sperm and an egg fertilized by an

397
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:20,400
intelligent sperm cell will make a super intelligent baby again just to go back to

398
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:28,800
the first sentence here i am a scientist this is some um i mean light eugenics it's

399
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:37,920
it's yeah it's a mild soft um here's what let me hit you with this open up sunday paper laugh at

400
00:40:37,920 --> 00:40:42,640
foxtrot done i'm i'm glad i'm done with this sunday paper because it will not be usable after

401
00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:49,120
this next part find the the maze or if your local paper does not have a maze junior jumble

402
00:40:49,120 --> 00:40:57,840
or maybe even the sudoku blast one out on it see who wins take that one and then do a pregnancy

403
00:40:57,840 --> 00:41:07,040
with it so i'm a scientist and i i'll tell you the the issue is that i came on the junior jumble

404
00:41:07,040 --> 00:41:12,480
solved it right there and the one that i saw sort of scribbling out the answers scooped him up with

405
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:21,440
a you know tool science tool and did a pregnancy with it and uh einstein jr came out so my problem

406
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:27,920
with this is that there's a lot of different kinds of intelligence yeah and i didn't get fluid liquid

407
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:35,520
and what you're solving for is a very particular type of um a very particular type of intelligence

408
00:41:35,520 --> 00:41:42,640
and i'm not necessarily sure i'm ready for a world populated by basically just will shorts just like

409
00:41:42,640 --> 00:41:51,040
a sort of huge gaggle of will shortes just sort of running buck wild across yeah where's our like

410
00:41:51,040 --> 00:41:55,760
street smart sperm you know what i mean like they can't make it through a maze but they could tell

411
00:41:55,760 --> 00:42:02,080
you how to get like how to get to the store the quickest way or like well let me tell you this is

412
00:42:02,080 --> 00:42:05,920
how it works this is where you're going to get like the freshest you know vegetables at the market

413
00:42:05,920 --> 00:42:11,600
or like uh you need to make friends with the bus drivers and that's how like where's that

414
00:42:11,600 --> 00:42:16,400
kind of intelligence they kind of tell us that they don't teach at sperm school you know yes

415
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:23,520
um the kind you learn living on the streets of goo york oh man

416
00:42:25,120 --> 00:42:31,120
we've talked a lot about new york which one they're both gonna stick right i mean they're

417
00:42:31,120 --> 00:42:39,200
both sort of well something's gonna stick oh god thanks i just want a sperm that's gonna be able to

418
00:42:39,200 --> 00:42:44,400
like explain twin peaks that return to me just like tell like oh i've never thought of it that

419
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:48,720
way you're intelligent in a very specific way so in order to come up with that joke i just said i

420

423
00:43:06,160 --> 00:43:14,400
watch list for some something uh here is another question um whenever i'm part of a group photo

424
00:43:14,400 --> 00:43:19,280
inevitably someone says okay now let's do a silly one i never know what to do for these and usually

425
00:43:19,280 --> 00:43:24,400
just didn't up making a face it looks like i'm in pain any help for what could be my thing that's

00:43:37,360 --> 00:43:44,960
list silly like no matter where this silly will always play you know what i mean i try to just

429
00:43:44,960 --> 00:43:49,520
sort of register my disappointment in the request in the photo itself and then like if everybody

430
00:43:49,520 --> 00:43:58,400
else is like making a fart face or a funny you know like either yelling or doing a like a you

434
00:44:17,120 --> 00:44:22,720

435
00:44:22,720 --> 00:44:28,560
your glasses on the back of your head and unbutton the your butt flaps so your butt's hanging out like

441
00:44:56,560 --> 00:45:00,880

444
00:45:15,920 --> 00:45:21,440
don't hurt them but just push them all over push them here's one that you all see a lot just give

445
00:45:21,440 --> 00:45:26,960
them like a was that was that was great because they'll be so excited to see that that's and

446
00:45:26,960 --> 00:45:31,280
somebody looks at that photo they're like when was this taken and you'll have to convince them

447
00:45:31,280 --> 00:45:36,320
that like no it was not during the wasab craze of that particular super bowl it was afterwards

448
00:45:36,320 --> 00:45:40,160
ironic why don't you want to hinge your jaw and put the head of the person standing in front of

449
00:45:40,160 --> 00:45:46,000
you completely in your mouth like a big snake or something i love that that's really funny when you

450
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:54,320
do that vogue vogue is good voguing is good maybe put on a really convincing mask so it's like

451
00:45:54,320 --> 00:46:02,320
suddenly what's that oh tom cruise was there what's he doing there but he wasn't so you're

452
00:46:02,320 --> 00:46:10,480
so you're thinking that you maybe are getting ready to leave for an event and you'll just sort

453
00:46:10,480 --> 00:46:18,240
of put into your back pocket a mask of tom cruise that you'll like just sort of carry with you

454
00:46:18,240 --> 00:46:23,440
throughout the day for this payoff you make an accent point justin what you're gonna need to do

455
00:46:23,440 --> 00:46:29,360
and i i will consider this part an homage to mr cruise himself you're going to already want to

456
00:46:29,360 --> 00:46:37,520
have the tom cruise mask on and then put a mask of yourself over it oh remove your mask to reveal

457
00:46:37,520 --> 00:46:44,160
tom cruise mask then it's good like mission impossible jokes exactly what about ellen ellen

458
00:46:44,160 --> 00:46:51,600
what about ellen um and bradley whitford brad bradley cooper do you remember at the oscars when

459
00:46:51,600 --> 00:46:56,720
they took that picture and like everybody was really deeply into it yeah for sure could you

460
00:46:56,720 --> 00:47:02,400
do something could you do something like that that's what that's taking a picture though

461
00:47:02,400 --> 00:47:07,440
griffin like you're you're already doing something like that by taking the picture i was just trying

462
00:47:07,440 --> 00:47:11,600
to take a good picture like good funny pictures it's a it's a hard needle of thread and they did

463
00:47:11,600 --> 00:47:17,920
a good job can you wear a child's uh two-piece bathing suit and then right when the picture's

464
00:47:17,920 --> 00:47:23,360
about to be taken you get a dog to kind of funny cute come up and like pull the bottom of your

465
00:47:23,360 --> 00:47:31,040
britches down i like that sort of like the exposed butt's gonna get you there like no matter what

466
00:47:31,040 --> 00:47:35,760
there's really no if your first ingredient is exposed but there's really no recipe but not

467
00:47:35,760 --> 00:47:40,720
mooning not mooning because that's gross and awful but like if a dog comes and shows your

468
00:47:40,720 --> 00:47:46,560
butt a little bit then here's my worry here's my worry about exposed butt guys oh yeah first

469
00:47:46,560 --> 00:47:53,840
time it's pretty funny the second third fourth fifth like okay but then do you think it comes

470
00:47:53,840 --> 00:48:05,040
back around on like the 12th time like he's doing but again yeah what if you just i don't know man

471
00:48:05,040 --> 00:48:12,560
smiled if you just have a nice smile what if you oh this is fucking great this is great

472
00:48:12,560 --> 00:48:17,840
just do like a fucking like sexy smile and then everybody else around you is like

473
00:48:20,560 --> 00:48:26,000
and you're in the background just like what's up but not in like the budweiser way but like

474
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:30,000
just that you're saying it in a cool way then everybody's gonna look at this picture and be

475
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:35,760
like look at all these jagoffs wait a minute who's that in the background who is this they

476
00:48:35,760 --> 00:48:41,360
they look like they just drank a bunch of apple juice so they're ready to go to my home my home

477
00:48:41,360 --> 00:48:47,280
to my hometown and here's here's the here's the power move if anyone sees that photo and says to

478
00:48:47,280 --> 00:48:52,560
you like that's weird everybody's doing a silly one why didn't you do a silly one you say here's

479
00:48:52,560 --> 00:48:58,480
the weird thing the photographer didn't say yeah that we were gonna do a silly one everyone else

480
00:48:58,480 --> 00:49:03,680
are just that's so good so they photographer actually said make it do a sexy one and that's

481
00:49:03,680 --> 00:49:07,440
why i look so sexy everybody else you see in this picture and it's everybody that is at this party

482
00:49:07,440 --> 00:49:11,360
that i they look really pissed off because i'm saying this really loudly so they can they're a

483
00:49:11,360 --> 00:49:18,560
bunch of fucking clowns when it comes to sexuality so what i'm saying is that i'm a mature grown-up

484
00:49:18,560 --> 00:49:25,040
who is in full control of their own sexuality yeah and and that could be yours that's what i've got

485
00:49:25,040 --> 00:49:30,560
on on doc every time you go to a party that these people host you bring that picture with you your

486
00:49:30,560 --> 00:49:35,280
new person comes apart hi what's up i'm david let me show you this picture before you sort of start

487
00:49:35,280 --> 00:49:44,000
making judgments about people here at the house um that is me in the back yeah it's different

488
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:48,080
than everyone else i know we were asked by the photographer to confront and expose our own

489
00:49:48,080 --> 00:49:54,800
sexuality and this is what these i mean forgive me clowns brought to the table vis-a-vis their

490
00:49:54,800 --> 00:49:59,920
their own human beautiful human sexuality do you like to get out of here would you like to get out

491
00:49:59,920 --> 00:50:03,440
of this den of clowns do you want to get out of here do you want to hook up with uh let's see

492
00:50:03,440 --> 00:50:08,080
there's two different groups of people doing charlie's angels so that's their sex so maybe

493
00:50:08,080 --> 00:50:14,160
we should just a go because it's as good as it gets jack nicholson do you guys think when they

494
00:50:14,160 --> 00:50:22,080
do a group shot at an event for clowns and they're like do a silly one i bet it fucking pops off

495
00:50:22,080 --> 00:50:29,040
right i bet it's like so silly back when clowns were legal because barnum and bailey shut down

496
00:50:29,040 --> 00:50:35,840
and by the way everybody just a heads up about that barnum bailey shut down so be on the lookout

497
00:50:35,840 --> 00:50:41,520
for clowns and jugglers just like roaming the streets like wild animals specifically jugglers

498
00:50:41,520 --> 00:50:46,560
you have to look out for but um i i would be careful about that i was driving the grocery

499
00:50:46,560 --> 00:50:51,600
store with my kids and i looked to my left and there's a motorcycle on a big steel ball

500
00:50:51,600 --> 00:50:55,600
it's not safe that's not safe get that off the road big steel ball could roll over my car crush

501
00:50:55,600 --> 00:50:59,760
like indiana jones here's the good here's the good news you're gonna see jugglers and you're

502
00:50:59,760 --> 00:51:03,200
gonna be terrified because they have the projectiles right there in their hands and it's

503
00:51:03,200 --> 00:51:08,400
very very scary but the truth is if they were to use one of those projectiles they then lose all

504
00:51:08,400 --> 00:51:13,360
their power and die like exactly don't be afraid of them yeah it's they're they're a lot more

505
00:51:13,360 --> 00:51:18,080
threatening uh looking than they actually are but don't get too close because if threatened

506
00:51:18,080 --> 00:51:24,480
they will sacrifice their juggling career to fend you off so appreciate it at a distance

507
00:51:24,480 --> 00:51:30,960
um the danger the majestic danger of the juggler well folks that's got to do it for us here on my
