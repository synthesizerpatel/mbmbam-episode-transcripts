1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:30,720
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:51,040
Hello everyone, and welcome to this very special episode of My Brother, My Brother, and Me.

6
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:58,320
My name is Justin McElroy. My name is Travis McElroy. I'm Griffin McElroy. We come to you

7
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:09,920
after what many are calling the hug heard around the world. Last night, two teams met on the field

8
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:17,680
of athletic competition preparing for the biggest sporting event of the year. The Carolina Panthers

9
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:26,240
and the Denver Broncos lined up against each other and then, apropos of nothing, before the first

10
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:32,880
ball had been thrown. Or kicked. Or kicked. Or rolled. Or rolled. Sometimes they just roll it.

11
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:36,240
That's a good trick play, by the way. That's a good thing. High school football coaches,

12
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:39,520
you just roll the ball and I'm just like, what do I do? Sorry, go on. Can I please finish this story?

13
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:45,440
Broncos quarterback Peyton Manning crossed the line of scrimmage,

14
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:52,160
illegal, not just in terms of sports rules. Yeah, not allowed to do that. But an actual crime.

15
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:57,600
Listen, the scrimmage line is there for a reason. And he walked across the line of scrimmage to

16
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:04,000
opposing quarterback Cam Newton. It was quarterback v. quarterback. It was in a rare play, quarterback

17
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:10,880
v. quarterback. Well, they were in the multi-ball bonus round. They set the ball aside and simply

18
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:17,280
embraced the crowd. I think my favorite part was as you watched the transition on Cam Newton's face

19
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:22,000
is he was like, what are you doing, man? What are you doing? So right. And then he

20
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:29,040
just like got it. Yeah. And that's how I felt watching at home was I get it. And it was like

21
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:35,600
we were all hugging Cam Newton. It was like all of us were hugging each other simultaneously.

22
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:40,000
I felt so connected to everybody. And they just called the game right there.

23
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:46,640
I spilled a Coke all over my friend Johnny because we hugged, but I was holding a Coke in my hands

24
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:50,800
and it just got all over him. And then I realized the cameras were filming us. And this was actually

25
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:57,120
a Coca-Cola commercial I was in. I felt like I was embracing everybody on earth at the same.

26
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:03,200
I was embracing Donald Trump. I was embracing Kim Jong Un and Kim Jong Dose and the whole family.

27
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:08,880
The whole set. The whole set of Kim Jongs, all of them. We were all embracing as one people.

28
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:13,280
And it was kicked off because two men, it was like, what if they threw a football war and

29
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:18,080
nobody came? And those two people- And they were finally able to set aside their differences.

30
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:19,600
Yeah, exactly.

31
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:24,000
I felt like I was, you know what, Justin? I felt like I was hugging myself. I was finally

32
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:30,800
able to forgive myself for everything. For all of my crimes against humanity.

33
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:38,800
It almost made me forget about the game itself in which Cam Newton and his good,

34
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:45,120
good passing just completely dunked up on that big old dinosaur Peyton Manning and how hard that

35
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:49,760
he lost. And then he cried because it was the last game of his career and he lost it so fucking bad.

36
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:51,200
He lost it super bad.

37
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:52,000
He lost it super bad.

38
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:52,400
Why is he dying?

39
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:54,960
It was my last one.

40
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:59,760
And he cried and cried and cried. The crying tears of an old, old man. And I was like,

41
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:00,720
fuck, Peyto.

42
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:06,320
See, I saw the hug for 20 seconds and I figured the game would not be held. I turned it off.

43
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:07,280
No, they still did it.

44
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:11,520
They still did it. They didn't televise it though, which was weird. Griffin was at the game.

45
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:15,520
Yeah. Peyto got posterized. He got dunked upon. It was weird.

46
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:21,200
I, the way I heard it, they just hugged the entire time. And then like all, like the water,

47
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:25,840
the hydration specialists, as they say, the water boy, they all hugged.

48
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:30,160
And then after about like an hour and a half, Coldplay came to the middle of the field.

49
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:35,120
They're like, oh right. Okay. So like, are we still going to do this show or what?

50
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:36,400
Or is everybody just going to hug?

51
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:40,000
And then Bruno Mars hugs Coldplay and they were like, don't you do this, man.

52
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:40,560
Don't you do this.

53
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:42,160
Don't you do this to me.

54
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:43,840
It's not your fault, Coldplay.

55
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:45,680
Don't you do this to me, Bruno Mars.

56
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:47,120
It's not your fault.

57
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:51,040
It was all yellow.

58
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:53,360
Hey, hey, look at me. I'd catch a grenade for you.

59
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:00,560
That's Chris Martin.

60
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:03,840
In case you're curious, that's what it sounds like with Chris Martin crying.

61
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:07,760
And also every record Coldplay has ever released. It sounds like that too.

62
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:10,640
Yellow.

63
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:13,120
Do you guys remember when we used to predict the Super Bowl

64
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:19,920
by putting the literal team animal or beings in a room together

65
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:21,360
and having them fight to the death?

66
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:25,200
Like one time it was the Cardinals and something else.

67
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:30,640
And we talked about like a bunch of popes just like fucking with machetes

68
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:32,880
taking on some Seahawks or something.

69
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:35,200
This is something we talked about on My Brother, My Brother, Me?

70
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:35,520
Yeah.

71
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:36,240
Something we did?

72
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:40,480
So you just like welcome everybody to the My Brother, My Brother, Me fancast,

73
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:41,600
My Brother, My Brother, and Me.

74
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:45,040
Well, no, I'm saying let's get into it.

75
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:46,880
No, because this is a great question.

76
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:47,840
It's not a great question.

77
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:48,800
No, shut up and listen.

78
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:51,040
I haven't even gotten to the fucking question yet.

79
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:51,440
Okay.

80
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:53,760
10 big beautiful horses.

81
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:55,600
Clydesdales? We talking Clydesdales?

82
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:58,240
Yeah, I think those would qualify as Broncos.

83
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:01,360
I think a Bronco is also a little bit fucking loco.

84
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:03,520
They buck as I understand.

85
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:08,080
They got that going for them versus 10 Panthers in a room

86
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:11,440
just big enough to hold all 20 of these animals.

87
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:14,240
It's like a fucked up redundant Noah's Ark.

88
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:16,560
Well, the problem, Griff, is-

89
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:18,400
Who's coming out that cage?

90
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:20,720
Your Panther is a stealth killer.

91
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:21,040
Yeah.

92
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:21,680
Right?

93
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:24,560
They're not really like your straight up fair fight.

94
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:29,600
They're more of like a pounce on you from the tree or some kind of canopy.

95
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:32,640
Whereas your Bronco, that's just a straight up murderer.

96
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:36,640
So I think they're going to stamp on them.

97
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:37,840
They're going to champ on them.

98
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:40,160
Champ on them?

99
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:40,480
Yeah.

100
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:42,800
You know how they champ at the bit?

101
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:45,360
They're going to champ on them.

102
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:46,880
Are you just saying chomp, but bad?

103
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:47,600
No, champ.

104
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:48,640
Horses champ.

105
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:49,680
Horses champ at the bit.

106
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:50,480
Horses champ.

107
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:54,640
Yeah, but I think there's something to be said about how much sharp stuff is on a Panther.

108
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:55,760
There's a lot of sharp-

109
00:06:55,760 --> 00:07:01,840
There's at least probably 30 sharp things on any given Panther.

110
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:03,440
And they're under quills.

111
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:04,720
And they have those under quills.

112
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:07,120
Do you think it's weird?

113
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:11,280
Do you know how good Peyton Manning must be at football?

114
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:14,240
That he is A, so old.

115
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:14,560
100.

116
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:20,800
And B, his backup is a guy that literally has the name of the team in his name.

117
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:22,960
His name is Bronco Swiler.

118
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:24,240
His name is in there.

119
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:26,960
Quarterback of the Broncos, Bronco Swiler.

120
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:28,480
That's right there.

121
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:30,240
You must be so good at football.

122
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:33,360
Because I'd love to be able to say Broncos Bronco Swiler.

123
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:33,760
That'd make a lot more-

124
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:35,680
I love how you pronounce his name.

125
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:36,160
Well, you've got to say-

126
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:37,840
It's one weird word.

127
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:42,080
If you don't say Bronco Swiler, then it's like you lose the joke.

128
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:44,400
It's got to sound like Bronco, Bronco Swiler.

129
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:45,600
This has all been amazing.

130
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:47,440
Really fucking, yeah.

131
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:51,040
I want to say one more really important thing about the Denver Broncos.

132
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:55,440
Travis Griffin, everybody listening at home, if it's safe for you right now,

133
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:59,200
call up a picture of the logo of the Denver Broncos for a second.

134
00:07:59,200 --> 00:07:59,840
I'll check it.

135
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:00,880
Just go ahead and pull it up.

136
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:03,280
I'll give you, let's call it three seconds because I've been-

137
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:04,560
I can do it in my head.

138
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:07,280
One thousand one, one thousand two, one thousand three.

139
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:13,280
Okay, I understand that you have to spice it up every few years

140
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:15,360
and really make it sleeker.

141
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:16,400
But in trying to make-

142
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:17,840
Yeah, they've taken it, yeah.

143
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:18,080
No, they've taken it too far.

144
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:23,600
In trying to make it so aesthetically sleek and give this illusion of movement,

145
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:28,080
they have drawn a logo of somebody pulling a horse's head off its body.

146
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:31,280
That is, right now, this horse has-

147
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:34,000
The reason it's stretched out like that and the reason there's no body

148
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,080
is that it just got pulled off a horse's body.

149
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:37,200
It's disgusting.

150
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,760
Just put a picture of a horsey on there.

151
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:40,480
It's not hard.

152
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:46,160
How about just a big muscular horse thumbs upping to you and be like, good football.

153
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:48,720
Yeah, see, that's what's getting lost here is that I love it

154
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:51,120
when a horse is just fucking diesel.

155
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:51,600
You know what I mean?

156
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:58,080
I love it when, listen, God's never made a mistake in the horse world.

157
00:08:58,080 --> 00:08:58,640
You know what I mean?

158
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:02,160
What if he was a super diesel horse with a cowboy hat

159
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:03,840
and he was kind of tipping it to you

160
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:07,520
and he had a sweet ass huge cigar dangling out of his mouth?

161
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:07,760
Yeah, that would be sick.

162
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:10,000
And you could just tell that he was a super cool dude.

163
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:14,880
See, you're losing the musculature in this fucked up, stretched out, torn off horse head.

164
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:21,600
And honestly, it looks like a snake or maybe like a dinosaur with neck plates.

165
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:22,480
It's fucking bad.

166
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:27,200
Last note, the Atlanta Falcons have always had

167
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:30,000
and will always have the best logo in professional sports.

168
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,720
Yeah, it looks like a superhero logo.

169
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:33,920
Fucking so sweet.

170
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:34,560
It's so rad.

171
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:36,640
And I don't really like the redesign from O3, but anyway.

172
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:40,080
So this has been our sports show, my brother, my brother, me,

173
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:43,200
and we are also this week gonna mix it up with some advice.

174
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:45,600
Our sports show, all the pretty horses.

175
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:47,360
Our sports show horse review.

176
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:54,800
We obviously have not seen the big game as we were forced to say legally,

177
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:57,920
but I'm sure we had a great time.

178
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:02,720
I'm predicting three defensive touchdowns from the Denver Broncos.

179
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:03,440
My boyfriend-

180
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:06,080
I apologize, by the way, that I sound like Shang Tsung,

181
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:09,600
the fucking emperor warlock from Mortal Kombat.

182
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:11,600
I've tied one on last night.

183
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:16,800
Professionalism, dedication, chastity.

184
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:18,160
Read the question, you ding dong.

185
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:22,400
My boyfriend likes to sit in the very front row of the movie theater.

186
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:26,640
He has a film degree and insisted it's the best way to watch movies,

187
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:29,840
even though everyone else tells him he is being a pain.

188
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:32,960
He will only go for center seats if it's a 3D movie.

189
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:34,000
That's legit.

190
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,920
When we go to the movies in a group,

191
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:38,400
his friends will leave us alone in the front

192
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:40,160
so they can go sit in the center.

193
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:43,040
How do I convince my boyfriend to sit in the people seats?

194
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:45,360
That's from sore neck in central Florida.

195
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:47,280
That is such a great way to think about it,

196
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:49,920
because you're right, the seats in the front,

197
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:51,120
those aren't people seats.

198
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:52,240
Those are there as a joke.

199
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:55,360
You know, when you get into a theater,

200
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:59,040
I've been to a couple opening night,

201
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:04,720
big time productions of movies and it's sold out

202
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:07,360
and you get in and the only seats are in the front row

203
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:10,880
and you're like, oh, well, I might as well leave.

204
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:12,960
I would rather sit on someone's lap

205
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:14,800
for the entirety of the movie

206
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:16,800
than sit in the front row seats,

207
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:19,120
because they're not actually there to be sat in.

208
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:22,000
It's like a joke, like these are jokes.

209
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,880
It is weird, it's just like, why do they,

210
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:27,520
they shouldn't sell them, the theater's full.

211
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:29,360
Like if that front row is the only row available,

212
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:32,000
the theater is full, there's no place to sit.

213
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,440
You can't sit anywhere.

214
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:35,680
They leave that whole row of seats for Elijah,

215
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:37,760
because he likes to stretch out.

216
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:41,200
He likes to really, he puts up the armrests

217
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:42,320
and he lays down some of the chairs

218
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:43,600
and he just takes a little nap right there.

219
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:46,640
Is there a professor at film school who's like,

220
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:49,520
oh yeah, Susan Cain's great, now lean in everybody.

221
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:50,640
I'm gonna tell you something

222
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:52,640
they won't tell you in regular school.

223
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:56,640
The best seats are in the front row.

224
00:11:56,640 --> 00:11:58,400
Keep that to yourself, be cool.

225
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:00,400
That's what they don't tell you.

226
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:03,040
It doesn't even make, it's a nonsensical argument

227
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:08,560
and here is why, if you are, I refuse to believe

228
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:10,640
that the entirety of the film industry

229
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:16,800
has been making movies specifically to be best enjoyed

230
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:18,240
by no one.

231
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:22,240
Unless every film was shot from underneath

232
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:24,080
the actors looking up at them.

233
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:25,760
Yeah, what if it was like that?

234
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:28,080
It was like those pictures where if you lean it enough

235
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:29,360
it looks like Abraham Lincoln.

236
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:32,240
You just get all the secret, like it all connects.

237
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:35,760
Oh, that's such an amazing, so what would those movies,

238
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:38,320
let's use Citizen Kane, let's use Jurassic Park.

239
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:42,000
But it's just filmed like you're just like under

240
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,520
and inside John Hammond.

241
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:46,240
So from like row five it's like,

242
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:48,560
this looks really stretched out and fucked up.

243
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:49,920
I don't get, like it sounds like

244
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:51,440
there's some sick dino action happening.

245
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:53,760
But I can't see them.

246
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:56,800
What sucks is actually if you watch Jurassic Park

247
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:59,120
that's just sort of how Jeff Goldblum looks.

248
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:01,920
So like when you do sit in the front row

249
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:03,600
you get sort of a different Goldblum.

250
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:06,240
Well you get a much more like Goldloom.

251
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:08,880
He's like right over you and it's wonderful.

252
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:11,360
It's what we all dream of happening all the time.

253
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:13,840
Just being fucking dominated by Jeff Goldblum.

254
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:14,960
You wanna know something weird?

255
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:17,200
I just one time I went to a movie,

256
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:20,400
I went to see Night of the Museum, the first one.

257
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:22,480
Night of the Museum?

258
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:24,160
Night at the Museum I believe it was.

259
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:26,160
This is my night, the museum.

260
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:26,960
This is my night.

261
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:31,360
And something happened and to this day

262
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:32,960
it still boggles my mind.

263
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:35,360
They were playing it in the wrong format

264
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:37,440
and I could see like the boom mic

265
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:39,200
and the cables on the ground.

266
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:40,240
No, you dream this.

267
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:43,200
This is real before they clicked it over

268
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:45,040
and then suddenly like the black bar

269
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:47,600
at the top of the bottom covered the whole thing.

270
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:49,840
No Travis, that's some Toy Story bullshit.

271
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:52,240
You think all movies are actually being acted out

272
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:53,600
in front of you every time you watched it.

273
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:54,960
I swear to God this happened.

274
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:58,000
The digi actors got sloppy in your version.

275
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,600
This is a whole night, there's no fuck.

276
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:03,040
So what you're imagining is maybe they filmed all of it

277
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:05,600
but there's a guy that stands up near the projector window

278
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:07,600
with two pieces of black construction paper.

279
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:09,680
I'm saying maybe there's a switch on the projector

280
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:14,560
that's like wide or your like full screen format.

281
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:16,960
Guys, it was so fucked up.

282
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:18,960
I was watching Night of the Museum

283
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:22,000
and then Ben Stiller forgot his line and said line

284
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,200
and it was like really quick.

285
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:28,480
Listen, I also am not 100% sure this wasn't a dream.

286
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:30,080
I'm just saying that this is a memory

287
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:31,440
that I have in my brain.

288
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:34,640
Hank Azaria in his tunic, his dick was hanging out

289
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:36,880
for like a lot of the movie.

290
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:40,080
Guys, Amy Adams fully Purple Rose of Cairode

291
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:41,840
out of the screen and asked me to come

292
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:44,160
and throw an incredible adventure is awesome.

293
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:46,800
Wait, maybe that's why this person

294
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:48,000
sits so close to the screen.

295
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:51,200
No, maybe if you've gone to film school long enough

296
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:54,640
you know that it's not every movie viewing

297
00:14:54,640 --> 00:14:56,320
but every 100th movie viewing

298
00:14:56,320 --> 00:15:00,560
you get one of these weird mutation versions of the film

299
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:03,040
where you can enter into the picture.

300
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:04,400
You can warp into it.

301
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:06,240
You can last action hero it.

302
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:08,640
Right, but you have to be sitting real close, right?

303
00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:10,400
Or Arnold's not gonna pick you.

304
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:11,680
Maybe if you sit close enough

305
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:14,800
you can see behind the giant black letter boxes

306
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:16,960
that they raise and lower to cover.

307
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:18,880
You can peek over and see the craft service table.

308
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:19,680
Yeah, exactly.

309
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:21,360
Travis, I have-

310
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:23,600
That's the most mental thing you've ever said.

311
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:27,520
I swear, it's like, I don't think I'm making it up.

312
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:31,360
Can you form other memories like surrounding that?

313
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:33,600
Can you summon up a memory of like you

314
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:35,760
and who else was there or like what you did before?

315
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:39,600
His mushrooms dealer was there.

316
00:15:42,640 --> 00:15:45,520
I can't remember anything else about the day.

317
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:48,720
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

318
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:50,240
Are you awake right now?

319
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:51,840
Can we be sure about this?

320
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:54,400
Can any of us be sure, Griffin?

321
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:55,760
Oh God, not again.

322
00:15:55,760 --> 00:15:56,560
Do you guys want Yahoo?

323
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:00,080
I have to know.

324
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:01,600
I have one other question, Travis.

325
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:07,600
When you have dwelled...

326
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:10,480
Okay, first off, I cannot believe we're nearly 300 episodes

327
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:13,920
before you dropped this fucking omega bomb on us.

328
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:16,000
Firstly, the craziest thing you've ever said

329
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,440
on this entire program.

330
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:19,600
I cannot believe you waited this long to deploy this.

331
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:20,160
That's one.

332
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:22,960
But maybe it needed this much time for the sands of time

333
00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:25,040
to eclipse the fact that it was indeed a dream.

334
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:28,960
But secondly, when you have observed this happening

335
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:32,640
in your mind's eye, what was the logistical reason

336
00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:37,040
that you could simmer up for the filmmakers filming things

337
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:39,760
that they would never ever want the audience to see?

338
00:16:39,760 --> 00:16:41,920
Because they knew it would be in letterbox.

339
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:43,840
That was my understanding is like,

340
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:46,400
well, this is going to be shown in widescreen format.

341
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:46,960
Exactly, yeah.

342
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:48,640
No one will ever see the cables.

343
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:50,400
Why even fucking worry about it?

344
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:51,840
When you see Hank Azaria's dick,

345
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:54,400
it's just right there at the bottom of the screen.

346
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:57,760
So you go behind the letterbox,

347
00:16:57,760 --> 00:16:59,920
and it's just full front of Azaria.

348
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:01,360
You know how in the breakup,

349
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:03,120
they shot Jennifer Aniston's ass

350
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:04,880
as she walked to the bathroom naked,

351
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:06,320
but then they were like, no one's going to see it

352
00:17:06,320 --> 00:17:09,840
because it's like in the widescreen format?

353
00:17:09,840 --> 00:17:10,320
Yeah, no.

354
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:12,320
You know, you know.

355
00:17:12,320 --> 00:17:12,960
That's the thing.

356
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:13,600
I literally don't.

357
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:14,320
This is the thing.

358
00:17:14,320 --> 00:17:16,080
Oh God, I hope that there are film students

359
00:17:16,080 --> 00:17:18,000
sitting in the front row movie theaters right now

360
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,560
tweeting at me, you are right.

361
00:17:20,560 --> 00:17:21,280
Man, I got to say,

362
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:21,680
people at the film school are really-

363
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:23,440
I hope you guys get Probe Roots of Cairode

364
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:24,320
right into that screen.

365
00:17:24,320 --> 00:17:25,920
I hope you get Last Action Heroed

366
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:26,960
right through the celluloid.

367
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:28,320
I was tweeting in the front row

368
00:17:28,320 --> 00:17:30,160
and Arnold Schwarzenegger turned to me and said,

369
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:31,280
hey, stop it.

370
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:32,880
I tried to kill Predator up here.

371
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:34,800
That's not what...

372
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:36,320
Do you guys want to Yahoo?

373
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:36,720
Please.

374
00:17:38,560 --> 00:17:40,960
This Yahoo was sent in by Zoe Kinski.

375
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:41,600
Climb that ladder.

376
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:43,120
How long is she going to be climbing that ladder?

377
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:44,000
Because I got to say-

378
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,200
As long as it takes.

379
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:46,480
She should be up there.

380
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:49,280
It's by Yahoo Answers user, something has gone wrong.

381
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:54,480
Let's call them Stealers Jack, okay?

382
00:17:55,280 --> 00:18:00,960
Asks, fair warning, a preface.

383
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:05,840
This breaks our own rule for the sort of code of conduct

384
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:07,520
for Yahoo's that make it on the show.

385
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:10,240
But it's a fascinating question.

386
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:14,960
I mass drew a biffed with my terrible towel.

387
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:15,760
Super Bowl party?

388
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:16,320
There's more.

389
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:25,440
Can you just do your best to try...

390
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:28,240
I don't want to make fun of people's writing

391
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:29,280
or spelling abilities.

392
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:30,800
Can you just translate for me

393
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:33,680
to the best of your knowledge you're reading there?

394
00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:36,160
What is your brain filling in the gaps to make it say?

395
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:40,000
Mass drew a biffed with my terrible towel.

396
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:40,720
Mass drew a biffed?

397
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:43,520
I think it means they were having a wank.

398
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:44,640
Having a wank.

399
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:48,160
I did a proper wank.

400
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:50,160
Reciting in gentlemanly fashion.

401
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:53,200
Should I bring my terrible towel

402
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:54,800
to the Super Bowl party tonight?

403
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:57,760
It's the same one that I used to masturbate with.

404
00:18:57,760 --> 00:19:00,640
And I just noticed there are stains on it.

405
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:01,600
If I do bring it...

406
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:03,520
I tried to fucking ramp over that, guys.

407
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:04,400
I'm sorry.

408
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:06,800
If I do bring it, my friends will know

409
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:08,400
I've been masturbating.

410
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:10,000
If I don't bring it,

411
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,160
they will question my loyalty to the Steelers

412
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:13,840
and I'll be the only one without a towel.

413
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:15,520
The game kicks off in an hour.

414
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:16,320
Help!

415
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:18,800
Yo dawg, I question your loyalty to the Steelers.

416
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:20,800
You're either the worst Steelers fan

417
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:22,240
or the biggest.

418
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:22,880
Yeah.

419
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:23,840
Can I say one thing?

420
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:26,320
Can I say one thing?

421
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:27,520
One thing on this subject.

422
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:28,560
Can I say one thing?

423
00:19:28,560 --> 00:19:29,920
Can I say just one thing first?

424
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:31,840
Can I just say one thing before you say one thing?

425
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:33,440
Let me get in my one thing real quick.

426
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:34,880
Let me just slide it wide and say,

427
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:36,560
it is most certainly terrible.

428
00:19:36,560 --> 00:19:38,400
Damn it, that was my one thing.

429
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:40,000
I thought that'd be both of your things.

430
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,360
It's an exceptionally terrible towel.

431
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:43,120
It's a very terrible towel.

432
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:44,720
I think they would get it and be like,

433
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:47,040
is this cum everywhere on this?

434
00:19:47,040 --> 00:19:48,080
Why did you do this?

435
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:49,200
And then they would get it like,

436
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:50,400
oh, wait a minute.

437
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:51,760
That's a terrible towel.

438
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:53,760
This has been promoted to Alexander's

439
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:55,680
no good, very bad, horrible towel.

440
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:58,800
Nobody liked this towel.

441
00:19:58,800 --> 00:20:01,280
It's not getting invited back to the towel gathering.

442
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:02,640
Everybody's screaming at him like,

443
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:03,440
fuck you, Jerry.

444
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:04,880
And then Steve stands up and he's like,

445
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:08,080
no, he has the worst towel.

446
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:09,040
And everyone agrees

447
00:20:09,040 --> 00:20:10,720
that they carry a model on their shoulders

448
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:12,160
and then they throw them in a dumpster.

449
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:15,520
Oh, God bless.

450
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:16,720
Maybe it catches on though.

451
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:18,720
And worst sporting trend of the year

452
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:22,000
goes to this guy for coming in towels.

453
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,720
Just, he's beaten out Vuvuzelas.

454
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:25,840
Congratulations.

455
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:29,920
Throwing batteries at people.

456
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:32,720
Those three trends, this is the worst one.

457
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:36,960
Oh, can you imagine not bringing your terrible,

458
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:39,600
terrible towel and your friends being like,

459
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:44,480
hey, do you not even care about the Steelers?

460
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:49,040
And you're like, no, I can't even begin to tell you

461
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:51,520
how much I care about the Steelers.

462
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:54,880
It's just my terrible towel.

463
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:57,040
You know how you're supposed to hold it in your hand

464
00:20:57,040 --> 00:20:57,920
and spin it around.

465
00:20:57,920 --> 00:21:00,880
Mine isn't, I don't want to be crass,

466
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:03,840
but it doesn't spin anymore.

467
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:07,920
How do you not have a towel, like two towels,

468
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:12,080
one for everyday use and one for special occasions?

469
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:13,440
Oh, okay, forget it.

470
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:17,040
No, what you said at the beginning is legit.

471
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:18,720
This is intentional.

472
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:20,800
You didn't just grab the one towel

473
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:24,000
that you fling around in circles in front of people

474
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,400
and not have that sort of like foresight.

475
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:29,600
Like, well, I mean, yeah, no, no,

476
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:30,960
that's not what happened.

477
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:36,960
Listen, this fucking, we can't un-jizz this towel.

478
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:37,680
It happened.

479
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:38,480
What happened happened.

480
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:39,280
You can't go back and be like,

481
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:41,360
why didn't you jizz into literally any other object

482
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:44,560
other than your sports activity?

483
00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:46,720
Griffin, when was this question asked?

484
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:48,640
Do you have access to that information?

485
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:49,840
Let me dig in.

486
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:52,640
Let me crack into the CSS.

487
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:57,040
No, no, I don't.

488
00:21:57,040 --> 00:21:58,880
Well, yes, seven years ago.

489
00:21:58,880 --> 00:21:59,680
Oh, okay.

490
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:01,360
Do you think this person's a father by now?

491
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:03,840
They're a towel dad, that's for certain.

492
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:10,000
AJ responded and said, you have time to wash and dry it.

493
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,360
That's an excellent point, AJ.

494
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:13,280
That's a fucking great point, AJ.

495
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:16,240
Especially if you say that on a solo mission,

496
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:18,400
you could be done 30 minutes.

497
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:21,600
To be fair though, Steelers Jack did use the word stain.

498
00:22:22,160 --> 00:22:23,440
Sorry, what was his name?

499
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:24,240
Steelers Jack.

500
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:27,040
Yeah, I didn't think about that one.

501
00:22:27,040 --> 00:22:30,800
Listen, get a fucking Tide pen, Steelers Jack.

502
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:31,680
This is easy.

503
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:32,880
There's a million solutions.

504
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:34,800
What if you accidentally bleach your terrible towel

505
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:37,360
and it comes out white and now it's a holy towel?

506
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:39,440
You're gonna need more of like a Tide paintbrush.

507
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:40,880
You're gonna need a Tide roller.

508
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:42,640
You're gonna need a Tide garbage can.

509
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:45,040
You're gonna need a Tide gun from Splatoon.

510
00:22:45,040 --> 00:22:46,880
Oh no, wait, I've got it.

511
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:48,000
I've got it, Steelers Jack.

512
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,280
You gotta go the other way.

513
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:51,840
You're gonna have to stain it worse with other stuff.

514
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:53,920
Oh my God.

515
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:55,440
Some spaghetti sauce, right?

516
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:57,120
And then you show up and your friend's like, what?

517
00:22:57,120 --> 00:22:58,720
And you're like, it never leaves my side.

518
00:23:00,560 --> 00:23:03,760
It is my spaghetti and also wankin' buddy.

519
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:05,680
I'm like, Arthur Dent over here.

520
00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:07,040
That makes me happy, Travis.

521
00:23:07,040 --> 00:23:08,080
I was worried you were gonna say

522
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:09,680
jerk off everybody else's towel.

523
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:15,440
That would take planning far outstripping the hour you've got.

524
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:17,520
That's a lot of Ocean's Eleven, you know,

525
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:20,640
getting past the censors to get to your friend's house.

526
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:23,360
Maybe if I had a Holocaust cloak, possibly,

527
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:25,440
with a month to plan, maybe.

528
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:28,000
We're talking about jerking off onto football towels

529
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,080
and you just dropped both Hitchhikers

530
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:34,080
and Princess Ride references and I'm super proud of you.

531
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:34,560
Thank you.

532
00:23:34,560 --> 00:23:35,520
I do what I can.

533
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:36,400
Here's another question.

534
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:39,120
I work in a job that doesn't have set hours.

535
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:41,520
Most people come in around nine, leave around five.

536
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:43,840
I come in early around seven, I leave around three.

537
00:23:44,560 --> 00:23:45,760
Give me a chart.

538
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:47,760
For some reason, a few of my coworkers

539
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:50,640
always feel the need to comment on the time I'm leaving work.

540
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:52,000
Oh, going home already?

541
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,640
How do I politely tell my coworkers to shut up

542
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:56,240
about the work hours I keep?

543
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:58,400
If it helps, I'm one of the most productive people

544
00:23:58,400 --> 00:23:59,360
in the office.

545
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:01,760
Staying at work later doesn't make you better than me

546
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:02,800
in Salt Lake City.

547
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:04,080
Oh, that was their name, okay.

548
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:06,400
Staying later, you get the idea.

549
00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:10,560
I think the easy answer is whenever they come in,

550
00:24:10,560 --> 00:24:12,560
be like, oh, you're coming in now, huh?

551
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:16,800
Like give them the same treatment but on the AM side.

552
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:18,400
Oh yeah, to everybody.

553
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:19,440
To every fucking person.

554
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:21,360
Your boss, mm, nine o'clock, huh?

555
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:22,960
That's weird.

556
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:25,200
Oh, well, two hours of traffic?

557
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:26,000
We've all been there.

558
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:28,720
That's why I left at five AM.

559
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:30,000
You're gonna stay late, right?

560
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:32,880
You're gonna stay late because of how late

561
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:33,520
you're coming in, right?

562
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:35,040
Just a second.

563
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:38,320
I'm not the boss of you, but I am the most productive person

564
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:39,440
in the office, so.

565
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:43,120
Yeah, and that's how he got the name Franklin,

566
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:47,200
the total ding-dong that everybody hates.

567
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:48,800
This is rough though, because I get it,

568
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:50,800
because if you're the first person there at seven

569
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:52,560
and no one else shows up at nine,

570
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:57,200
those two hours don't exist to anyone else.

571
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:57,440
Yeah.

572
00:24:57,440 --> 00:24:58,240
You know what I mean?

573
00:24:58,240 --> 00:24:59,920
They don't show up at nine and think,

574
00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:01,840
I bet he's been here since seven.

575
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:07,040
You need to send out some Snapchats or something.

576
00:25:07,040 --> 00:25:07,280
Yeah.

577
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:10,080
Something that's like, just got to work,

578
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:11,520
to everybody you work with.

579
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:15,040
Or set enough traps that there's no way

580
00:25:15,040 --> 00:25:18,000
you could have done it without a couple hours of planning.

581
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:19,760
What are you, what?

582
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:22,240
Like, you know how, like, okay,

583
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:24,080
when the Wet Bandits showed up at Kevin's house-

584
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:24,560
Fuck me.

585
00:25:24,560 --> 00:25:26,480
Can we go a single episode?

586
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:27,680
They did not think, oh man,

587
00:25:27,680 --> 00:25:29,360
I bet he just got here five minutes ago.

588
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:31,200
That is my favorite part of Home Alone,

589
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:32,800
when the Wet Bandits take a step back

590
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:34,480
and they're like, listen, I hate this kid.

591
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:34,960
Fuck him.

592
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:35,440
Am I right?

593
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:35,840
Am I right?

594
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:36,400
Okay.

595
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:37,920
But wow, Ryan.

596
00:25:37,920 --> 00:25:38,320
Wow.

597
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:39,360
Good traps.

598
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:39,920
Good traps.

599
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:40,880
He is doing great.

600
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:41,600
Hey, Kev.

601
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:43,440
Kevin, great traps.

602
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:44,720
It's me, Joe Pesci.

603
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:47,680
I'm a big fan of your traps.

604
00:25:47,680 --> 00:25:49,840
The problem with most traps,

605
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:52,240
like, I'm saying if you set enough office traps,

606
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:53,200
they show up, they think,

607
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:54,960
God, he's been here for a couple hours, huh?

608
00:25:55,680 --> 00:25:56,960
Definitely, like, he got here early.

609
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:58,880
That's one way, it's a way to prove

610
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:01,520
that you've been there for a while,

611
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:03,120
is to set up plenty of office traps.

612
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:04,560
The problem with office traps,

613
00:26:04,560 --> 00:26:07,680
as I have, like, the ones that I know about,

614
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:10,560
there's very few that are guaranteed

615
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:11,920
to end the way you want them to.

616
00:26:11,920 --> 00:26:14,880
Like, the thing about the bucket and the doorframe,

617
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:18,560
like, that probably ends with the bottom of a bucket

618
00:26:18,560 --> 00:26:19,920
falling on somebody and killing them.

619
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:22,080
Like, definitely, that's how it ends

620
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:23,600
80% of the time, I would think.

621
00:26:25,680 --> 00:26:28,320
The whoopee cushion, that has never worked.

622
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:30,000
Did you know whoopee cushion has never worked?

623
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:32,480
Yeah, because you sit on it

624
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:34,080
and your butt closes the lip part

625
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:35,120
and it's just like,

626
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:36,640
you're sitting on a weird balloon for a second.

627
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:37,920
And it just explodes.

628
00:26:37,920 --> 00:26:39,440
You're sitting on a hemorrhoid donut.

629
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:40,400
It's miserable.

630
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:41,120
It doesn't work.

631
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:42,880
What about, like, a tiger pit?

632
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:46,320
Depends on where you work, I guess.

633
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:46,800
Yeah, that's a good point.

634
00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:48,960
See, I think I would make such a good pit

635
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:51,600
in trying to cover it up with leaves and branches

636
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:53,280
that it would be like, fine.

637
00:26:53,280 --> 00:26:53,920
Oh, that?

638
00:26:53,920 --> 00:26:56,080
That patch of the break room

639
00:26:56,080 --> 00:26:57,840
that's covered with leaves and branches?

640
00:26:57,840 --> 00:26:59,840
That's been there for, I don't know, months.

641
00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:00,960
But it could backfire,

642
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:03,040
because if you started and didn't finish

643
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:05,360
in the two hours before everyone else showed up

644
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:06,000
and they were like,

645
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:09,040
oh, couldn't get that tiger pit done, huh?

646
00:27:09,040 --> 00:27:11,040
And then you just look like a real asshole.

647
00:27:11,040 --> 00:27:12,560
Yeah, and if you leave at three that day,

648
00:27:12,560 --> 00:27:12,960
they're like,

649
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:14,480
don't you want to finish your tiger pit first?

650
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:16,240
Aren't you going to finish the tiger pit, Dave?

651
00:27:17,920 --> 00:27:18,640
Damn, Dave.

652
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:21,920
You didn't know you were a real half-asser, Dave.

653
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:24,240
A tiger's going to go hungry, Dave.

654
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:24,800
That's on you.

655
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:25,440
You're in danger.

656
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:27,920
Guess you're going to finish that one tomorrow, huh, Dave?

657
00:27:27,920 --> 00:27:29,280
All right, see you at nine.

658
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:32,000
I love that Justin apparently thinks

659
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,160
that a tiger pit is a cool place

660
00:27:34,160 --> 00:27:36,880
for tigers to eat and hang out and do whatever.

661
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:40,000
That's my favorite bar, the tiger pit.

662
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:41,120
I have to assume that,

663
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:43,440
because what kind of dumb, dumb shit are you suggesting

664
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:46,160
that he has tigers in his office that he's trying to capture?

665
00:27:46,160 --> 00:27:46,560
Why would that be the case?

666
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:48,560
That's why he's got to leave early, before dinner.

667
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:50,480
Tiger dinner.

668
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:52,240
I would go to the zoo.

669
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:54,800
I don't want to be in there after three, man.

670
00:27:56,160 --> 00:27:57,520
No, that's when the tigers come to life

671
00:27:57,520 --> 00:27:59,280
and start talking to Kevin James.

672
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:03,360
That's why no one pulls graveyard shifts

673
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:04,560
at the Gremlin factory.

674
00:28:04,560 --> 00:28:05,760
No one wants that gig.

675
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:06,880
Ugh, gross.

676
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:07,360
No way.

677
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:08,160
I don't want to be there.

678
00:28:08,160 --> 00:28:10,560
Gremlin is a terrible slang term for Mogwai.

679
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:12,080
What?

680
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:12,880
Sorry?

681
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:13,360
What?

682
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:15,360
No, sorry, what?

683
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:17,760
I mean, they're called Mogwai.

684
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:20,640
Gremlin is the bad thing that they become.

685
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:22,480
It's offensive.

686
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:23,760
Okay, so here, okay, wait a minute.

687
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:24,560
Okay, so-

688
00:28:24,560 --> 00:28:24,880
Wait a minute.

689
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:30,240
Okay, though, Travis, I think Travis has a point.

690
00:28:31,040 --> 00:28:31,520
Thank you.

691
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:34,400
Their species remains constant.

692
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:36,480
They are still Mogwai.

693
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:39,440
Mogwai, they have a side of them

694
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:41,840
that we don't particularly care for.

695
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:42,400
Okay, okay.

696
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:44,000
And we just start using,

697
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:48,080
I mean, let's call it what it is, a slur against Mogwai.

698
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:52,320
So was this cryptozoological civics lesson delivered

699
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:55,120
in the special mushrooms cut of gremlins

700
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:56,800
that the two of you apparently watched together?

701
00:28:58,160 --> 00:29:01,040
The bottom, if you could remove the letter box

702
00:29:01,040 --> 00:29:04,080
from Night Around the Museum

703
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:05,120
or whatever preposition-

704
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:09,600
Night Within the Museum.

705
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:10,800
If you remove the letter box,

706
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:14,000
you would just see a Mogwai down there at the bottom

707
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:17,920
giving you a very thorough lecture about nomenclature

708
00:29:17,920 --> 00:29:18,880
and the power of words to hurt you.

709
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:20,560
Yeah, don't use the G word, yeah.

710
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:21,440
Right.

711
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:25,280
I think it was called Ben Stiller's Museum Nights.

712
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:31,680
Well, I preferred the original Ben Stiller's Museum,

713
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:34,400
but I thought that the sequel was much sexier.

714
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:36,000
Yeah, way hotter.

715
00:29:36,560 --> 00:29:38,000
Should we go to the fucking Money Zone?

716
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:39,280
Yeah, cool.

717
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:50,880
Y'all wanna hear about Blue Apron?

718
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:52,640
Y'all wanna hear me brag about the dope ass meals

719
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:53,760
I've been making with Blue Apron?

720
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:56,000
Did you make that steak, Sammy?

721
00:29:56,720 --> 00:29:59,200
Yeah, oh, you know we made that steak, Sammy.

722
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:00,800
Yeah, that Sammy with a,

723
00:30:00,800 --> 00:30:05,920
there was like a Sammy that had like onions and mushrooms,

724
00:30:05,920 --> 00:30:07,040
which like, I'll tell you what,

725
00:30:07,040 --> 00:30:08,720
I never ate mushrooms until I got-

726
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:09,280
Oh, same.

727
00:30:09,280 --> 00:30:11,040
Like I enjoy a mushroom at a restaurant.

728
00:30:11,040 --> 00:30:12,320
I never, ever cooked with them.

729
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:14,160
And then it was like the featured guy

730
00:30:14,160 --> 00:30:16,720
in the last week of ingredients.

731
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:18,160
And it was like on point.

732
00:30:18,160 --> 00:30:19,760
It was some good mushroom eating.

733
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:20,880
For less than $10 a meal,

734
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:22,560
Blue Apron delivers all the fresh ingredients

735
00:30:22,560 --> 00:30:24,080
you need to create home-cooked meals.

736
00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:26,240
You just follow the easy step-by-step instructions.

737
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:28,240
Okay, there, go, yes.

738
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:30,240
Yeah, it's an ingredient delivery service

739
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:33,680
and they have recipes and you get amazing,

740
00:30:33,680 --> 00:30:35,280
really, really, really tasty meals.

741
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:42,400
I have a beef taco with mole that is still waiting for me.

742
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:43,440
I'm really, really excited.

743
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:45,040
Maybe I should bring that to the Super Bowl party

744
00:30:45,040 --> 00:30:46,000
I'm going to today.

745
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,800
Just two tacos with mole and steak.

746
00:30:48,800 --> 00:30:50,080
This is for me, thank you.

747
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:51,440
This is for me, please don't watch me eat this.

748
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:52,880
Please don't watch me eat this.

749
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:54,080
Coming up this week,

750
00:30:54,080 --> 00:30:57,840
the meals this week are roast chicken supreme

751
00:30:57,840 --> 00:31:00,640
with mashed potatoes, gravy, and maple-glazed carrots.

752
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:02,880
Spiced salmon with black rice, avocado,

753
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:04,000
and blood orange salad.

754
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:04,800
Fuck.

755
00:31:04,800 --> 00:31:05,600
My goodness.

756
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:07,760
Steak sandwich with caramelized onions,

757
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:10,080
garlic aioli, and honey roasted parsnip fries.

758
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:11,040
Oh my God.

759
00:31:11,040 --> 00:31:13,600
Miso honey roasted chicken and baby sweet potatoes

760
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:15,280
with stir fried sesame bok choy.

761
00:31:15,280 --> 00:31:16,320
Jesus Christ.

762
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:18,960
And they've got vegetarian options as well.

763
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:21,200
Yeah, so no matter what your dietary preferences,

764
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:24,000
Blue Apron makes it a breeze to discover and prepare dishes

765
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:25,760
like the ones that we've been talking about.

766
00:31:26,800 --> 00:31:27,680
Right in your own kitchen.

767
00:31:27,680 --> 00:31:29,440
You don't have to go to somebody else's kitchen.

768
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:31,840
Here's a pro tip secret from Travis McElroy.

769
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:35,040
We get the ones that are like for two people,

770
00:31:35,040 --> 00:31:36,080
for me and Teresa,

771
00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:38,080
and there's always tons of leftovers.

772
00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:40,080
This will be like your lunch the next day.

773
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:41,760
It's such a good deal.

774
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:43,360
Here's a pro tip for me.

775
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:44,400
Here's a pro tip for me.

776
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:45,040
No, there's not.

777
00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:46,240
Oh, well.

778
00:31:47,040 --> 00:31:47,360
Okay.

779
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:51,120
You can get your first two meals for free

780
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:52,880
at blueapron.com slash my brother.

781
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:54,720
That's blueapron.com slash my brother.

782
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:55,680
I know we like,

783
00:31:55,680 --> 00:31:57,680
we're always very effusive about the products

784
00:31:57,680 --> 00:31:59,360
we advertise on this show

785
00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:01,280
because frankly they're all baller

786
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:02,640
and if they weren't, we wouldn't do it.

787
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:06,240
But Blue Apron has changed my life

788
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:08,720
because I am cooking constantly now

789
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:11,040
and I love to cook, but I hate shopping for shit.

790
00:32:11,040 --> 00:32:15,840
And this is the ideal way to cook meals, Blue Apron.

791
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:16,800
Check it out.

792
00:32:16,800 --> 00:32:18,480
I also want to tell you about Squarespace.

793
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:20,640
We've been talking about Squarespace.

794
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:22,800
Squarespace has been a sponsor of us for a long time.

795
00:32:22,800 --> 00:32:26,640
But I could say that we built the macroshows.com website

796
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:27,600
on Squarespace.

797
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:30,080
It's got links to like all of our projects and stuff.

798
00:32:30,080 --> 00:32:32,800
But the important part is everybody who looks at it,

799
00:32:32,800 --> 00:32:36,080
no joke, has said, wow, what a professional website.

800
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:37,360
Like it looks so good.

801
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:40,960
Yeah, it's like a weird involuntary hive mind response.

802
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:43,520
Yeah, and I did it in about 45 minutes.

803
00:32:44,160 --> 00:32:48,880
Like it was the most straightforward just structure.

804
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:53,040
It was so simple and so user-friendly.

805
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:54,880
I recommend it.

806
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:57,040
If you're looking to build a professional looking website,

807
00:32:57,040 --> 00:32:58,720
but you have no idea what you're doing,

808
00:32:59,280 --> 00:33:00,720
Squarespace is the way to go.

809
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:02,400

810
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:04,800

00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:08,720
Try it for free and you don't have to pay anything to start.

812
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:10,080
And then if you like what you're doing,

00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:13,120

Go to squarespace.com slash my brother.

816
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:18,080
My brother.

817
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:18,640
You should.

818
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:20,560
Squarespace.

819
00:33:20,560 --> 00:33:20,960
I am.

820
00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:22,800
You should.

821
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:24,640
Justin, can I tell you something?

822
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:25,040
Do it.

823
00:33:25,040 --> 00:33:25,600
You should.

824
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:26,560
I...

825
00:33:27,920 --> 00:33:30,400
You should Squarespace.

826
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:30,800
All right.

827
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:33,360
I'm just trying a couple of different reads

828
00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:34,240
and we can just pick the best one.

829
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:34,720
I like it.

830
00:33:35,280 --> 00:33:37,680
I have a message for Spud and it's from...

831
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:39,520
Don't laugh at that.

832
00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:41,680
Okay.

833
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:43,600
It's from McBabby.

834
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:44,880
If you want to get a message on the show,

835
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:46,960
personal message or a message for your small business,

836
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:48,880
go to maximumfun.org slash Jumbotron.

837
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:49,600
It's real easy.

838
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:51,280
Stop sending weird shit.

839
00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:53,520
They don't have to be weird, you guys.

840
00:33:53,520 --> 00:33:54,560
They don't have to be weird.

841
00:33:54,560 --> 00:33:57,040
We literally, just like a quick disclaimer,

842
00:33:57,040 --> 00:34:02,400
we have turned down like two or three Jumbotron ads this week

843
00:34:02,400 --> 00:34:04,560
and we hate doing it because like we know it's always like

844
00:34:05,280 --> 00:34:07,760
in a good spirit, but just like,

845
00:34:08,400 --> 00:34:10,800
please, I just need to be able to understand what I'm saying.

846
00:34:11,680 --> 00:34:13,040
I mean, I'm less worried about that

847
00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:17,280
and more worried about like, don't have a say like creepy stuff too.

848
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:20,560
Maybe 2015 is the year of Jumbotron sincerity.

849
00:34:21,120 --> 00:34:23,040
Just like keep it real.

850
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:24,480
Just keep it very real.

851
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:25,360
That said.

852
00:34:25,360 --> 00:34:27,440
Here's a message for Spud from McBabby.

853
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:28,960
This is a very sincere message.

854
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:31,360
Hey Spud, happy belated birthday.

855
00:34:31,360 --> 00:34:33,920
Thanks for being a good friend, always believing me

856
00:34:33,920 --> 00:34:36,000
and not murdering me when we finally met.

857
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:36,960
Talk to you later.

858
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:38,160
I like this a lot.

859
00:34:38,160 --> 00:34:39,600
I like this concept of just like,

860
00:34:39,600 --> 00:34:43,120
listen, we're all just a bunch of fucking primal beasts, aren't we?

861
00:34:43,120 --> 00:34:44,400
I love this idea of just like,

862
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:47,440
hey guys, thanks for not murdering me.

863
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:50,160
Well, maybe this was one of those Craigslist friendships.

864
00:34:50,160 --> 00:34:50,880
Sure.

865
00:34:50,880 --> 00:34:52,640
Yeah, friend for friend.

866
00:34:52,640 --> 00:34:54,480
Friend for friend, looking for friend.

867
00:34:55,200 --> 00:34:57,840
And then it's like, oh, I hope this person is actually my friend.

868
00:34:57,840 --> 00:35:03,360
Absolutely, absolutely not looking for somebody just to jerk off with.

869
00:35:03,360 --> 00:35:05,280
Absolutely not what this is.

870
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:06,160
Don't even bring it up.

871
00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:08,960
Sexual friend for friend, no stabbing, please.

872
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:10,000
No stabbing, no games.

873
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:11,440
Stabbers need not apply.

874
00:35:15,120 --> 00:35:16,560
Justin, you gonna read this next one?

875
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:17,600
Hell yeah.

876
00:35:17,600 --> 00:35:22,640
This one's going out to Amanda from, that's a fucking cool name.

877
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:23,520
Yeah, for sure.

878
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:25,120
I thought I was reading one name,

879
00:35:25,120 --> 00:35:27,040
then halfway through I thought I was reading another one.

880
00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:28,640
It's like, mm, daddy like.

881
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:33,600
So daddy like, Amanda, this message is from Jackie.

882
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:34,960
Here it is.

883
00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:37,440
Dear Amanda, I'm sorry for getting high

884
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:39,200
and taking your shit in the monastery.

885
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:45,440
Dad, I didn't know where I was and I got confused.

886
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:47,280
Thank you for cleaning me up.

887
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:49,760
I know I was totally wasted and I owe you one.

888
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:51,760
Thanks for letting me live in your house too.

889
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:53,680
No one could ever love me like you.

890
00:35:53,680 --> 00:35:56,000
That says, love always, Jackie.

891
00:35:57,520 --> 00:35:58,400
What happened?

892
00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:01,600
I choose to believe that this is 100% sincere.

893
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:03,200
I love that.

894
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:04,000
I'm into that.

895
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:05,120
I believe it is sincere.

896
00:36:05,120 --> 00:36:09,840
Or possibly is a message that Amanda bought for herself

897
00:36:09,840 --> 00:36:11,360
from her dog, Jackie.

898
00:36:11,360 --> 00:36:13,840
That is my other possible option.

899
00:36:13,840 --> 00:36:16,880
You know when dogs get super high and they take shit places?

900
00:36:17,680 --> 00:36:19,040
Well, the second half of that happens.

901
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:21,600
And I assume dogs are getting high too

902
00:36:21,600 --> 00:36:23,440
because like, how else are they getting through?

903
00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:29,040
Hello there, my name is Graham Clark.

904
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:30,240
And I'm Dave Shumka.

905
00:36:30,240 --> 00:36:34,080
And together we host a podcast called Stop Podcasting Yourself.

906
00:36:34,080 --> 00:36:36,640
This is a file that you download from the internet

907
00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:38,480
and then you listen to it in your pod.

908
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:39,920
What's that about, you ask?

909
00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:41,280
Well, who are you to ask?

910
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:42,480
Who do you think you are?

911
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:44,400
Yeah, get lost, bozo.

912
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:46,560
We're a couple of stand up comedians

913
00:36:46,560 --> 00:36:48,880
in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada.

914
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:51,520
And every week we bring a guest on the show.

915
00:36:51,520 --> 00:36:52,800
Sometimes they're Canadian.

916
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:54,080
Sometimes they're not.

917
00:36:54,080 --> 00:36:55,440
Sometimes they're a ghost.

918
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:58,720
It's like you're sitting in on a friendly afternoon chat.

919
00:36:58,720 --> 00:37:01,520
Plus we're Canadian, so you get a tax break.

920
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:07,760
You can find us on iTunes or online at MaximumFun.org.

921
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:11,600
Do you guys want a yahoo?

922
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:12,720
Yes.

923
00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:13,440
I guess I do.

924
00:37:14,080 --> 00:37:17,600
I have two extremely good ones and I want to get to both of them.

925
00:37:17,600 --> 00:37:19,040
Can I have, do we have any like,

926
00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:21,680
are the rest of the email questions like totally baller

927
00:37:21,680 --> 00:37:23,120
or can I do two yahoo's in a row?

928
00:37:24,160 --> 00:37:25,600
Scraps, what do you say?

929
00:37:28,080 --> 00:37:30,000
They're all pretty good, but we can do yahoo's

930
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:31,760
and then just save them for next week.

931
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:33,920
I can also save the yahoo's for next week.

932
00:37:34,720 --> 00:37:35,120
This one was-

933
00:37:35,120 --> 00:37:36,160
Let's just see how it goes.

934
00:37:36,160 --> 00:37:38,080
This one was sent in by Jacob Powels.

935
00:37:38,080 --> 00:37:38,800
Thank you, Jacob.

936
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:44,240
It is by Yahoo Answers user Vanessa who asks,

937
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:48,080
three mysterious stones at my front door?

938
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:52,160
Today I got home and saw that there were three stones

939
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:53,440
lined up at my front door.

940
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:56,160
This is the second time I've seen something like this at my door.

941
00:37:56,160 --> 00:37:58,880
Does anyone know what this could be or mean?

942
00:37:58,880 --> 00:38:02,000
I've asked my family and no one seems to know how it got there.

943
00:38:03,840 --> 00:38:04,640
Pirate curse?

944
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:06,240
Explain.

945
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:07,840
Like a black spot?

946
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:10,960
Like this is, I don't think it's the same as the black spot

947
00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:12,400
because the black spot is like,

948
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:14,480
hey, you betrayed us and now we have to kill you.

949
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:15,360
Yeah, it's also a black spot.

950
00:38:15,360 --> 00:38:16,320
Maybe the three stones is like,

951
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:18,560
you've been chosen as the new pirate.

952
00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:19,360
You got chose.

953
00:38:20,240 --> 00:38:20,960
You done been chose.

954
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:23,440
Hi, I'm a pirate and you got chose.

955
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:24,480
You're on my team now.

956
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:26,080
Welcome to the squad, squad goals.

957
00:38:26,080 --> 00:38:28,400
Have you ever seen Wild and Crazy Kids?

958
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:29,360
Yeah.

959
00:38:29,360 --> 00:38:30,400
You know how they have teams?

960
00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:33,600
Well, that's based on pirate teams.

961
00:38:33,600 --> 00:38:34,480
The old tradition.

962
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:38,960
The concept of people working together?

963
00:38:39,680 --> 00:38:41,600
It's based on pirate teams.

964
00:38:41,600 --> 00:38:43,840
Pirates were the first people to be like-

965
00:38:43,840 --> 00:38:46,880
They used to get together and roll like a giant stone around

966
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:48,640
while they were festooned with ribbons

967
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:51,600
and you could only get the ribbons by killing each other.

968
00:38:51,600 --> 00:38:52,640
Well, they soften that a bit.

969
00:38:52,640 --> 00:38:55,040
Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay.

970
00:38:55,040 --> 00:38:59,680
Travis, Travis, Travis, are you literally high right now?

971
00:38:59,680 --> 00:39:01,360
Are you literally on acid?

972
00:39:01,360 --> 00:39:04,240
Did you drop right before we started recording

973
00:39:04,240 --> 00:39:06,000
this comedy podcast together?

974
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:08,960
No, not that I know of.

975
00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:11,600
Because you've been saying some next level shit.

976
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:17,760
It's 8.55 AM, more Travis's.

977
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:18,400
That's correct.

978
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:20,960
I've had my morning coffee, I took the dog on a walk

979
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:22,400
and I thought about pirate teams.

980
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:26,480
Travis, just so I can understand what you're saying.

981
00:39:26,480 --> 00:39:31,520
You're saying that one day a pirate was sword fighting

982
00:39:31,520 --> 00:39:35,360
with a British naval officer and another pirate came up

983
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:38,960
from behind and stabbed the British naval officer

984
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:40,720
and he was like, how dare you?

985
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:43,760
What is this witchcraft?

986
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:47,120
I was fighting him, not you.

987
00:39:47,120 --> 00:39:50,160
And then the first pirate's like, well, I gotta go

988
00:39:50,160 --> 00:39:53,280
and he jumps onto his pirate ship and sails it by himself.

989
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:54,960
Like fuck, this sucks.

990
00:39:54,960 --> 00:39:56,880
Oh my God, it's so hard.

991
00:39:56,880 --> 00:39:59,280
I'm jigging the mast and I have to steer

992
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:02,000
and I have to look out for sharks and whales.

993
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:04,320
Oh, I wish I could get some fucking help.

994
00:40:04,320 --> 00:40:06,160
You know the term every man for himself?

995
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:07,920
Yeah, okay.

996
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:10,560
That was it for a long time.

997
00:40:10,560 --> 00:40:11,120
That was it.

998
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:14,480
The bible was very short.

999
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:17,280
One day, Donnie Jeff Coats, great, great, great, great, great,

1000
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:19,440
great, great, great, great, great grandfather,

1001
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:23,760
Captain Jeff Coat said, you know what, fuck that shit.

1002
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:28,080
It's a coach made out of Jeffs.

1003
00:40:28,080 --> 00:40:29,040
The Jeffs that I killed.

1004
00:40:29,040 --> 00:40:30,720
So that they may not see me, Jeff.

1005
00:40:34,160 --> 00:40:35,440
I don't know where to stab him.

1006
00:40:35,440 --> 00:40:36,720
He's just, he's all Jeff.

1007
00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:40,080
He's just Jeff from Fern to Mast.

1008
00:40:40,080 --> 00:40:42,560
He's just fucking Jeff all over, I don't get it.

1009
00:40:42,560 --> 00:40:45,440
From starboard to port, he's all Jeff.

1010
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:45,940
What?

1011
00:40:46,560 --> 00:40:48,160
He's Jeff from tip to toe.

1012
00:40:48,160 --> 00:40:49,520
That's crazy.

1013
00:40:52,240 --> 00:40:56,080
Every time I think I draw a bead on a Jeff,

1014
00:40:56,080 --> 00:40:58,000
another Jeff takes its place.

1015
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:00,400
I've lopped off so many Jeffs.

1016
00:41:03,360 --> 00:41:05,200
Okay, are we gonna talk about the three stones

1017
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:06,880
or is this the discussion now?

1018
00:41:07,520 --> 00:41:08,400
Captain Jeff Coat?

1019
00:41:09,040 --> 00:41:09,540
Yeah.

1020
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:13,680
Probably Jeff Coats great, great grandfather.

1021
00:41:13,680 --> 00:41:15,040
Or how many greats was it?

1022
00:41:15,040 --> 00:41:16,800
There's a lot of greats, yeah.

1023
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:17,520
Too many greats.

1024
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:18,720
I think you put him in like the middle class.

1025
00:41:18,720 --> 00:41:21,920
Yeah, each one lives to be 12, has a child, and dies.

1026
00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:25,280
If you see the dread pirate robber,

1027
00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:28,960
if you see an 11 and a half year old named Jeff

1028
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:32,240
looking panicked and horny, that is a Jeff Coat.

1029
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:33,200
No question about it.

1030
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:33,920
Yeah, for sure.

1031
00:41:33,920 --> 00:41:35,600
He has got to continue the line.

1032
00:41:36,640 --> 00:41:37,760
Like a tsetse fly.

1033
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:41,520
The show Wild and Crazy Kids was about Donnie Jeff Coat

1034
00:41:41,520 --> 00:41:44,080
trying to find a successor that was savage enough

1035
00:41:44,080 --> 00:41:44,800
and also 12 enough.

1036
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:47,600
The most wild and the most crazy kid.

1037
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:54,320
What are these three stones mean?

1038
00:41:56,720 --> 00:41:58,800
All right, let's do this back to back Yahoo situation.

1039
00:41:58,800 --> 00:42:00,640
This one was sent in by Brooks Oglesby.

1040
00:42:00,640 --> 00:42:02,800
Brooks Oglesby maybe needs a name.

1041
00:42:03,360 --> 00:42:05,280
Because this is like the third or fourth one of his

1042
00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:05,840
that I've read.

1043
00:42:07,520 --> 00:42:08,560
We'll think about it.

1044
00:42:08,560 --> 00:42:09,040
Okay.

1045
00:42:09,040 --> 00:42:10,080
We'll have it for the next time.

1046
00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:11,360
Thank you, Brooks.

1047
00:42:11,360 --> 00:42:15,040
It's by Yahoo Answers User Anonymous who asks,

1048
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:19,520
do you think we'll ever have an emo president?

1049
00:42:21,840 --> 00:42:23,840
Imagine a president of the United States.

1050
00:42:23,840 --> 00:42:26,800
Skinny jeans, long emo hair, all that jazz.

1051
00:42:27,520 --> 00:42:29,920
Well, what do you think, teens?

1052
00:42:34,480 --> 00:42:37,520
First of all, I don't think jazz is a big part of the emo scene.

1053
00:42:38,720 --> 00:42:39,680
Oh, but if it were.

1054
00:42:39,680 --> 00:42:41,840
Oh, but if it were.

1055
00:42:41,840 --> 00:42:44,400
Your lips to God's ears.

1056
00:42:48,560 --> 00:42:49,520
Dark jazz is.

1057
00:42:50,480 --> 00:42:51,040
What's that?

1058
00:42:51,600 --> 00:42:52,400
Dark jazz.

1059
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:55,200
That's what emo kids are into, dark jazz.

1060
00:42:57,440 --> 00:42:57,680
Yeah.

1061
00:42:57,680 --> 00:43:03,760
So it's just like, with like, you know, onyx trumpets and stuff.

1062
00:43:03,760 --> 00:43:04,480
So hold on.

1063
00:43:04,480 --> 00:43:04,880
No.

1064
00:43:04,880 --> 00:43:09,280
Dark jazz is all about the zeal for life that they don't have.

1065
00:43:09,280 --> 00:43:09,520
Yeah.

1066
00:43:10,240 --> 00:43:14,320
It's all about the notes that you don't play because you're dead.

1067
00:43:14,320 --> 00:43:14,640
Yeah.

1068
00:43:15,600 --> 00:43:17,360
I liked mine better, Travis.

1069
00:43:17,360 --> 00:43:17,520
Yeah.

1070
00:43:17,520 --> 00:43:18,080
Let's pretend it was just-

1071
00:43:18,080 --> 00:43:18,960
Yeah, go ahead and cut mine.

1072
00:43:18,960 --> 00:43:20,320
Just cut Travis's.

1073
00:43:20,320 --> 00:43:20,800
You're out.

1074
00:43:22,240 --> 00:43:27,920
Do you think we'll ever have that emo president that our country deserves to make us all great again?

1075
00:43:28,720 --> 00:43:29,760
Vote for me or don't.

1076
00:43:29,760 --> 00:43:30,240
Whatever.

1077
00:43:30,240 --> 00:43:30,640
Whatever.

1078
00:43:30,640 --> 00:43:31,120
Shut up.

1079
00:43:31,840 --> 00:43:36,720
At this point, at this point, I might think about it.

1080
00:43:36,720 --> 00:43:39,200
Hey, that's very low press.

1081
00:43:39,200 --> 00:43:40,080
I'm into it.

1082
00:43:40,080 --> 00:43:40,720
Yeah.

1083
00:43:40,720 --> 00:43:45,040
If someone was up on that stage, a big, beautiful, honorable, debating stage,

1084
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:51,920
but they had that long emo hair and the jeans would be very skinny on this person.

1085
00:43:51,920 --> 00:43:52,640
How skinny?

1086
00:43:54,240 --> 00:43:55,440
Talking about some nuthuggers.

1087
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:56,400
Okay.

1088
00:43:57,120 --> 00:43:57,760
You asked.

1089
00:43:58,480 --> 00:43:58,880
I know.

1090
00:43:59,440 --> 00:44:02,640
Do you think that we would find him especially electable?

1091
00:44:03,440 --> 00:44:06,400
I would find him delectable, but would I find him electable?

1092
00:44:06,400 --> 00:44:08,720
Do you know what we love in this country, Griffin?

1093
00:44:08,720 --> 00:44:09,200
Change.

1094
00:44:09,200 --> 00:44:10,240
We love change.

1095
00:44:10,240 --> 00:44:10,880
We embrace it.

1096
00:44:10,880 --> 00:44:11,920
We just look for something different.

1097
00:44:11,920 --> 00:44:22,160
I'm sick of those insider baseball politicians who they've been doing it all wrong for so long,

1098
00:44:22,160 --> 00:44:28,880
and I'm ready for somebody who's going to get up there and tell me how it is in a depressing manner.

1099
00:44:30,080 --> 00:44:30,880
But honest.

1100
00:44:30,880 --> 00:44:31,360
Honest.

1101
00:44:31,920 --> 00:44:34,320
Honest, but more depressing.

1102
00:44:34,320 --> 00:44:35,360
Like a depressing-

1103
00:44:35,360 --> 00:44:38,000
Can a whole emo band run for president?

1104
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:40,560
Like, hi, I'm President Newfound Glory.

1105
00:44:41,600 --> 00:44:42,560
Is that a new found glory?

1106
00:44:42,560 --> 00:44:43,600
An emo band?

1107
00:44:43,600 --> 00:44:44,160
Yeah.

1108
00:44:44,160 --> 00:44:46,880
Well, they were pop punk, but they had, you know, they were in the scene.

1109
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:50,480
But they weren't Christian pop punk?

1110
00:44:51,760 --> 00:44:52,720
Okay, that's fine.

1111
00:44:52,720 --> 00:44:53,920
Fall Out Boy then.

1112
00:44:53,920 --> 00:44:54,480
Hi, I'm President-

1113
00:44:54,480 --> 00:44:56,400
Fall Out Boy is not emo.

1114
00:44:56,400 --> 00:44:57,840
You don't actually know an emo band scene.

1115
00:44:57,840 --> 00:44:59,280
Dashboard Confessional?

1116
00:44:59,280 --> 00:45:00,800
That's definitely in there.

1117
00:45:00,800 --> 00:45:02,640
Could we elect an emu president?

1118
00:45:02,640 --> 00:45:06,000
Hi, everybody.

1119
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:10,720
I'm an emu, and we all vote for him, and we're like, fucking, that's so funny and cool.

1120
00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:15,600
He got an emo, and then the emu's like,

1121
00:45:15,600 --> 00:45:20,800
hey, big news, I have some decidedly draconian opinions on abortion.

1122
00:45:20,800 --> 00:45:23,920
Like, whoa, emu, oh no.

1123
00:45:23,920 --> 00:45:27,520
We thought it was so funny and cool that we elected an emu president,

1124
00:45:27,520 --> 00:45:30,640
but you have some decidedly draconian opinions on abortion.

1125
00:45:30,640 --> 00:45:32,800
We did not pay any attention to his platform.

1126
00:45:32,800 --> 00:45:33,360
We didn't think about the platform.

1127
00:45:33,360 --> 00:45:34,960
Only his long, graceful neck.

1128
00:45:34,960 --> 00:45:38,080
We just thought about how graceful he would look in an Oval Office.

1129
00:45:38,640 --> 00:45:40,720
How great those future stamps would be.

1130
00:45:40,720 --> 00:45:42,400
Just the best stamps.

1131
00:45:42,400 --> 00:45:43,120
Wouldn't it be great?

1132
00:45:43,120 --> 00:45:45,120
Wouldn't it be so fucking funny, though?

1133
00:45:47,840 --> 00:45:50,800
You know that one where it's like rows of presidents,

1134
00:45:50,800 --> 00:45:52,560
like you see like those charts, right?

1135
00:45:52,560 --> 00:45:54,880
With like the different paintings of the presidents,

1136
00:45:54,880 --> 00:45:57,120
and like his would just be a neck,

1137
00:45:57,120 --> 00:46:00,400
and then just like reaching up into Lyndon Baines Johnson

1138
00:46:00,400 --> 00:46:01,680
would be an emu head.

1139
00:46:01,680 --> 00:46:04,080
Because he didn't fit in the frame.

1140
00:46:04,080 --> 00:46:05,280
So fucking funny.

1141
00:46:05,920 --> 00:46:07,840
Our first three-term president.

1142
00:46:07,840 --> 00:46:10,480
Yeah, because you cannot get him to leave.

1143
00:46:10,480 --> 00:46:12,800
He's incredibly fast and incredibly vicious.

1144
00:46:12,800 --> 00:46:14,240
And he's got those kicking legs.

1145
00:46:14,240 --> 00:46:16,640
Yeah, those kicking legs with the sharp claws.

1146
00:46:16,640 --> 00:46:22,000
We'll have to elect President Ostrich to take him down.

1147
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:24,000
Because that's the only thing?

1148
00:46:24,640 --> 00:46:25,200
Yeah.

1149
00:46:25,200 --> 00:46:26,800
I bet you let me in there with a gun.

1150
00:46:28,240 --> 00:46:30,160
You would think, but he took all our guns away.

1151
00:46:30,160 --> 00:46:30,640
Not mine.

1152
00:46:31,600 --> 00:46:32,080
I hid it.

1153
00:46:33,280 --> 00:46:34,320
Where'd you hide it, Garvin?

1154
00:46:35,920 --> 00:46:36,800
In a box.

1155
00:46:36,800 --> 00:46:38,080
He just like can't get in there.

1156
00:46:39,200 --> 00:46:39,760
No thumbs.

1157
00:46:39,760 --> 00:46:40,720
No thumbs.

1158
00:46:40,720 --> 00:46:41,440
Sharp claws.

1159
00:46:43,440 --> 00:46:47,280
So I was saying like-

1160
00:46:47,280 --> 00:46:48,240
You're talking about emus?

1161
00:46:48,880 --> 00:46:49,920
I was talking about emos.

1162
00:46:50,480 --> 00:46:52,400
But then you realize we knew less about emo

1163
00:46:52,400 --> 00:46:54,640
than we do about emus, improbably?

1164
00:46:55,760 --> 00:46:56,480
That's true.

1165
00:46:57,120 --> 00:46:58,000
Against all odds.

1166
00:46:58,000 --> 00:46:59,360
That's-

1167
00:46:59,360 --> 00:47:00,400
This question stinks.

1168
00:47:01,200 --> 00:47:01,760
You stink.

1169
00:47:02,800 --> 00:47:04,640
Read a normal one from a normal human.

1170
00:47:04,640 --> 00:47:10,960
Wikipedia says that emus, in addition to their diet of insects,

1171
00:47:11,600 --> 00:47:13,680
emus drink infrequently.

1172
00:47:14,240 --> 00:47:18,640
And I kind of feel like that maybe isn't necessarily a good thing.

1173
00:47:19,200 --> 00:47:20,400
Maybe they should like,

1174
00:47:20,400 --> 00:47:23,120
if they had magazines to tell them to drink more,

1175
00:47:23,120 --> 00:47:25,200
maybe they'd be getting ahead in the world, you know?

1176
00:47:26,480 --> 00:47:27,440
You're saying they're just not-

1177
00:47:27,440 --> 00:47:28,240
That's really good, Justin.

1178
00:47:28,240 --> 00:47:32,080
Yeah, they're not hydrated enough to really be president?

1179
00:47:32,080 --> 00:47:33,680
Are you guys thirsty?

1180
00:47:33,680 --> 00:47:33,920
Yeah.

1181
00:47:33,920 --> 00:47:35,280
Well, whatever.

1182
00:47:35,280 --> 00:47:37,200
That's what I'm saying is like emus should be drink-

1183
00:47:37,200 --> 00:47:39,920
Maybe if emus were drinking more, they'd be doing a bit better.

1184
00:47:39,920 --> 00:47:40,320
All right.

1185
00:47:40,320 --> 00:47:41,040
Can we-

1186
00:47:41,040 --> 00:47:41,440
Okay.

1187
00:47:41,440 --> 00:47:43,680
And have more energy in their day-to-day lives.

1188
00:47:44,880 --> 00:47:47,920
But you know how no emu has ever accomplished anything ever?

1189
00:47:47,920 --> 00:47:48,480
Yeah, right?

1190
00:47:48,480 --> 00:47:49,680
Like maybe they would be president

1191
00:47:49,680 --> 00:47:52,240
if they would just fucking just keep a brita with them.

1192
00:47:52,240 --> 00:47:52,560
Just like-

1193
00:47:52,560 --> 00:47:54,080
Or get some electrolytes or something.

1194
00:47:54,080 --> 00:47:55,120
Found it, you know?

1195
00:47:55,120 --> 00:47:56,640
You could drink green tea.

1196
00:47:56,640 --> 00:47:58,000
That's hydrating as well.

1197
00:47:58,640 --> 00:48:01,280
Yeah, and like it's not as caffeinated as black tea,

1198
00:48:01,280 --> 00:48:03,040
so like you can still go to bed on time.

1199
00:48:03,040 --> 00:48:05,120
This is episode 289.

1200
00:48:05,120 --> 00:48:10,880
We've done this 288 and almost one extra on top of that times now.

1201
00:48:10,880 --> 00:48:11,040
Yeah.

1202
00:48:11,600 --> 00:48:13,680
Is this our most fanciful episode?

1203
00:48:14,720 --> 00:48:17,920
I feel like we've gone on some fancy flights on this one.

1204
00:48:17,920 --> 00:48:19,040
Some flights of fancy,

1205
00:48:19,040 --> 00:48:24,080
just some fucking absurdist like mind voyages together.

1206
00:48:24,080 --> 00:48:24,320
Yeah.

1207
00:48:24,320 --> 00:48:28,560
Yeah, and mentioning that during the podcast

1208
00:48:28,560 --> 00:48:31,360
is one way to really submit your comedic legacy.

1209
00:48:31,360 --> 00:48:34,800
You know, I love my favorite episodes of MST3K

1210
00:48:35,440 --> 00:48:37,600
are the ones where in the last 15 minutes or so

1211
00:48:38,960 --> 00:48:42,640
they take the puppets off and they just talk to each other about like,

1212
00:48:42,640 --> 00:48:45,120
how did you guys think the jokes went today on this one?

1213
00:48:45,760 --> 00:48:48,000
And they sometimes they still use their hands

1214
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:49,280
to talk with the puppet voices,

1215
00:48:49,280 --> 00:48:51,200
but like the puppets, they're not wearing them anymore.

1216
00:48:51,200 --> 00:48:53,200
They're just like, they just talk about how the show went.

1217
00:48:53,200 --> 00:48:56,560
Okay, but Justin, even that is a pretty fanciful thought.

1218
00:48:57,360 --> 00:48:58,880
I mean, the one I just said?

1219
00:48:58,880 --> 00:48:59,120
Yeah.

1220
00:48:59,120 --> 00:49:00,640
Yeah, it's kind of whimsical.

1221
00:49:00,640 --> 00:49:03,040
Are we trapped in like a fanciful spiral?

1222
00:49:03,040 --> 00:49:04,160
Say something, Griffin.

1223
00:49:04,160 --> 00:49:05,440
Say something logical, Griffin.

1224
00:49:06,080 --> 00:49:10,320
Okay, I can't.

1225
00:49:10,320 --> 00:49:11,600
I'm incapable of it.

1226
00:49:13,360 --> 00:49:15,360
I like in the Monty Python

1227
00:49:15,360 --> 00:49:17,280
when they switch from the dead parrot skit

1228
00:49:17,280 --> 00:49:18,800
they have one of their famous transitions

1229
00:49:18,800 --> 00:49:21,920
to like one of those cartoons and it's just God's face.

1230
00:49:21,920 --> 00:49:23,520
Like, hey listen guys,

1231
00:49:24,160 --> 00:49:27,760
I think this one might be got a little bit much.

1232
00:49:27,760 --> 00:49:30,800
Oh my God, they do say the bits are gotten too silly.

1233
00:49:31,360 --> 00:49:34,240
Monty Python does comment on how their shit is going.

1234
00:49:34,240 --> 00:49:35,840
Is that what we need to aspire to?

1235
00:49:36,400 --> 00:49:38,240
Yeah, no, yeah.

1236
00:49:38,240 --> 00:49:39,520
I don't want, yeah.

1237
00:49:39,520 --> 00:49:42,320
I don't want like a bunch of people quoting Monty Python jokes

1238
00:49:42,320 --> 00:49:45,520
that is supposed to be out in a major way.

1239
00:49:45,520 --> 00:49:47,200
Oh man, RIP Twitter indeed.

1240
00:49:47,200 --> 00:49:50,720
I know, I definitely can't go on there.

1241
00:49:52,080 --> 00:49:53,200
No, no, no.

1242
00:49:53,200 --> 00:49:54,320
It's just a landmine.

1243
00:49:54,320 --> 00:49:55,440
Pull the cord, get out.

1244
00:49:55,440 --> 00:49:55,920
Get out.

1245
00:49:55,920 --> 00:49:59,760
How many birds can carry a pilot?

1246
00:49:59,760 --> 00:50:01,040
Get me out of here.

1247
00:50:01,040 --> 00:50:02,000
I'll see you guys at Peach.

1248
00:50:02,720 --> 00:50:04,880
Look at my silly walking.

1249
00:50:04,880 --> 00:50:06,000
Yeah, I'm headed to Peach.

1250
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:06,960
No, no, no.

1251
00:50:06,960 --> 00:50:07,680
Blast off.

1252
00:50:08,560 --> 00:50:09,680
Get me out of here, JGL.

1253
00:50:09,680 --> 00:50:11,760
We have a nice to say night.

1254
00:50:11,760 --> 00:50:13,040
No, I'm an L-O.

1255
00:50:13,040 --> 00:50:15,200
I can't hear anywhere but we heard L-O.

1256
00:50:15,200 --> 00:50:19,040
I'm done.

1257
00:50:19,040 --> 00:50:22,480
This has been our comedy podcast,

1258
00:50:22,480 --> 00:50:23,920
My Brother, My Brother, and Me.

1259
00:50:24,640 --> 00:50:26,800
It's an advice show for the modern era.

1260
00:50:28,560 --> 00:50:30,240
Want to say a big thank you to Blue Apron

1261
00:50:30,240 --> 00:50:31,360
who makes cooking at home easy

1262
00:50:31,360 --> 00:50:33,440
and get your first two meals for free

1263
00:50:33,440 --> 00:50:36,240
by going to blueapron.com slash my brother.

1264
00:50:38,080 --> 00:50:41,040
I would like, I have an impassioned plea.

1265
00:50:41,040 --> 00:50:42,320
It occurred to me this morning.

1266
00:50:42,320 --> 00:50:43,120
I was on Twitter.

1267
00:50:43,120 --> 00:50:47,920
If you wield any power on Twitter at all,

1268
00:50:47,920 --> 00:50:51,440
even base level, at Twitter Incorporated,

1269
00:50:51,440 --> 00:50:53,680
I would really like to be verified.

1270
00:50:53,680 --> 00:50:54,720
I don't know what that takes,

1271
00:50:55,920 --> 00:50:57,360
but this has gone on for too long.

1272
00:50:57,360 --> 00:50:59,440
Yeah, Justin and I have been in the verified club for a while.

1273
00:50:59,440 --> 00:51:02,960
And let me tell you, the golden trophies

1274
00:51:02,960 --> 00:51:05,120
we just get in the mail for no reason

1275
00:51:05,120 --> 00:51:06,560
if Twitter likes our shit,

1276
00:51:07,360 --> 00:51:08,640
it's actually getting ridiculous.

1277
00:51:08,640 --> 00:51:09,760
I just started throwing them away

1278
00:51:09,760 --> 00:51:10,960
because there's only so much shelf space in the house.

1279
00:51:10,960 --> 00:51:11,760
I want that.

1280
00:51:11,760 --> 00:51:12,560
I want that.

1281
00:51:12,560 --> 00:51:13,440
I want that.

1282
00:51:13,440 --> 00:51:15,200
I have a whole shelf for it, please.

1283
00:51:15,200 --> 00:51:16,240
I could send you some online.

1284
00:51:16,240 --> 00:51:17,920
Please let me be verified, please.

1285
00:51:19,280 --> 00:51:20,320
I want it so bad.

1286
00:51:20,880 --> 00:51:22,240
It means literally nothing

1287
00:51:22,240 --> 00:51:25,360
and it gets you nothing on a platform that is now dead

1288
00:51:25,360 --> 00:51:28,000
because 100% of our interactions are gonna be,

1289
00:51:29,520 --> 00:51:31,200
it's a man-eating rabbit, snee.

1290
00:51:32,800 --> 00:51:35,360
Snee, it's me, Monty.

1291
00:51:35,360 --> 00:51:37,920
I still want it, still want it.

1292
00:51:37,920 --> 00:51:38,420
Cool.

1293
00:51:40,080 --> 00:51:42,080
Go listen to all the other Maximum Fun shows.

1294
00:51:42,080 --> 00:51:43,840
There's a ton of really, really great shows

1295
00:51:43,840 --> 00:51:45,360
on the Maximum Fun network.

1296
00:51:45,360 --> 00:51:46,880
I'm talking about shows like Throwing Shade.

1297
00:51:46,880 --> 00:51:50,480
I'm talking about shows like Oh No, Ross and Carrie.

1298
00:51:50,480 --> 00:51:52,240
I'm talking about shows like Can I Pet Your Tongue?

1299
00:51:52,240 --> 00:51:56,000
Oh No, Ross and Carrie, by the way, just did Scientology.

1300
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:57,280
Yeah, which they've been working on forever.

1301
00:51:57,280 --> 00:51:58,800
I cannot wait.

1302
00:51:58,800 --> 00:52:00,880
Yeah, so yeah, there's that.

1303
00:52:00,880 --> 00:52:02,240
We have a bunch of our other stuff.

1304
00:52:02,240 --> 00:52:04,080
You can find it all at McElroy Shows.

1305
00:52:04,080 --> 00:52:07,200
I do a Bachelor podcast with my wife called Rose Buddies.

1306
00:52:07,200 --> 00:52:10,160
I do a new, just launched two episodes in,

1307
00:52:10,160 --> 00:52:12,960
a video game design podcast called Cool Games, Inc.

1308
00:52:14,720 --> 00:52:16,240
I do one with my wife that we just launched

1309
00:52:16,240 --> 00:52:18,160
called Schmanners, all about etiquette.

1310
00:52:19,040 --> 00:52:22,080
Our third episode was all about conversation etiquette.

1311
00:52:22,080 --> 00:52:24,400
And I know that we've had lots of people ask questions

1312
00:52:24,400 --> 00:52:26,240
to my brother, my brother, and me about like,

1313
00:52:26,240 --> 00:52:27,440
how do I small talk?

1314
00:52:27,440 --> 00:52:28,080
Yeah, it's all there.

1315
00:52:28,080 --> 00:52:29,200
How do I talk to people?

1316
00:52:29,200 --> 00:52:30,720
And we cover a lot of that in there.

1317
00:52:30,720 --> 00:52:31,600
So go check it out.

1318
00:52:31,600 --> 00:52:34,160
And then also, I'm very proud to announce

1319
00:52:34,160 --> 00:52:38,160
that the Things I Bought at Sheets is back.

1320
00:52:38,720 --> 00:52:39,920
It's long hiatus.

1321
00:52:39,920 --> 00:52:41,200
And better than fucking ever.

1322
00:52:41,200 --> 00:52:44,400
Your last episode is a fucking barn burner.

1323
00:52:44,400 --> 00:52:45,200
Thank you.

1324
00:52:45,200 --> 00:52:45,920
Thank you, Griffin.

1325
00:52:45,920 --> 00:52:48,400
It was really an emotional journey when she recorded.

1326
00:52:48,400 --> 00:52:49,680
I'm glad it really-

1327
00:52:49,680 --> 00:52:50,880
It made me laugh a lot.

1328
00:52:51,680 --> 00:52:52,240
Oh, God.

1329
00:52:52,240 --> 00:52:52,560
Well, that's-

1330
00:52:52,560 --> 00:52:53,600
It made me think a lot.

1331
00:52:53,600 --> 00:52:54,320
Thank you, Travis.

1332
00:52:54,320 --> 00:52:55,280
That's what we were going for.

1333
00:52:57,440 --> 00:52:59,600
Sheetswithazshow.com.

1334
00:53:00,320 --> 00:53:01,680
Go to macroshows.com, baby.

1335
00:53:01,680 --> 00:53:02,880
Yeah, it's all there, it's all there, it's all there.

1336
00:53:02,880 --> 00:53:03,840
Yeah, yeah, yeah, it's all there.

1337
00:53:03,840 --> 00:53:05,600
I wanna thank John Roderick and the Long Winters

1338
00:53:05,600 --> 00:53:07,200
for the use of our theme song, It's a Departure,

1339
00:53:07,200 --> 00:53:10,080
off the album, Putting the Days to Bed.

1340
00:53:11,120 --> 00:53:12,400
He's a sweet man.

1341
00:53:12,400 --> 00:53:15,520
And his tunes really shred.

1342
00:53:16,400 --> 00:53:18,000
And he's a very tall man.

1343
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:18,400
He's a tall, sweet man.

1344
00:53:18,400 --> 00:53:19,760
So you should listen to his music.

1345
00:53:20,720 --> 00:53:21,840
Y'all want that final yahoo?

1346
00:53:22,640 --> 00:53:23,520
Yes, please.

1347
00:53:23,520 --> 00:53:24,960
This one was sent in by Zoe Kinski.

1348
00:53:24,960 --> 00:53:25,760
Climb that ladder.

1349
00:53:25,760 --> 00:53:27,040
Oh, just a few more rungs.

1350
00:53:28,240 --> 00:53:29,600
Oh, oh, get in there.

1351
00:53:29,600 --> 00:53:30,240
Thank you, Zoe.

1352
00:53:30,240 --> 00:53:31,680
It's by Yahoo Answers users.

1353
00:53:31,680 --> 00:53:32,880
Sorry, something has gone wrong.

1354
00:53:32,880 --> 00:53:36,560
His avatar looks like a zwingy cartooned version

1355
00:53:36,560 --> 00:53:38,640
of Neo from the Matrix.

1356
00:53:38,640 --> 00:53:40,080
I'm gonna call him Neo from the Matrix.

1357
00:53:40,080 --> 00:53:46,080
Asks, is it possible to use science from weird science

1358
00:53:46,080 --> 00:53:48,720
to make Aaron E-surance real?

1359
00:53:48,720 --> 00:53:55,120
My name is Justin McElroy.

1360
00:53:55,120 --> 00:53:56,400
I'm Travis McElroy.

1361
00:53:56,400 --> 00:53:57,280
I'm Griffin McElroy.

1362
00:53:57,280 --> 00:53:58,800
This has been my brother, my brother and me.

1363
00:53:58,800 --> 00:54:03,920
This has been my brother, my brother and me.

1364
00:54:03,920 --> 00:54:18,960
Kiss your dad square on the lips.

1365
00:54:18,960 --> 00:54:20,880
Maximumfun.org.

1366
00:54:20,880 --> 00:54:21,920
Comedy and culture.

1367
00:54:21,920 --> 00:54:23,040
Artist-owned.

Listener-supported.

1369
00:54:24,160 --> 00:54:25,360
Hello, internet.

1370
00:54:25,360 --> 00:54:26,960
I'm Travis McElroy.

1371
00:54:26,960 --> 00:54:28,480
And I'm Theresa McElroy.

1372
00:54:28,480 --> 00:54:29,440
She is my wife.

1373
00:54:29,440 --> 00:54:30,640
And he's my husband.

1374
00:54:30,640 --> 00:54:32,560
And it is our pleasure to introduce to you

1375
00:54:32,560 --> 00:54:33,840
a brand new podcast.

1376
00:54:34,400 --> 00:54:35,760
Shmanners.

1377
00:54:35,760 --> 00:54:37,440
It's extraordinary etiquette.

1378
00:54:37,440 --> 00:54:38,960
For ordinary occasions.

1379
00:54:38,960 --> 00:54:40,320
Theresa, let me ask you this.

1380
00:54:40,320 --> 00:54:42,640
Can you teach me how to write a thank you note?

1381
00:54:42,640 --> 00:54:43,600
Yes, I can.

1382
00:54:43,600 --> 00:54:45,920
How about tips to improve my table manners?

1383
00:54:45,920 --> 00:54:47,280
I'll do my best.

1384
00:54:47,280 --> 00:54:49,520
And will you finally explain to me the difference

1385
00:54:49,520 --> 00:54:52,000
between casual and business casual

1386
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:55,680
and cocktail and formal and black tie and all that stuff?

1387
00:54:55,680 --> 00:54:57,760
If anybody can, I can.

1388
00:54:57,760 --> 00:54:59,680
But like, it's going to be funny, right?

1389
00:54:59,680 --> 00:55:00,400
Of course.

1390
00:55:00,400 --> 00:55:03,280
I'm going to give historical origins

1391
00:55:03,280 --> 00:55:06,880
and how those manners fit into our everyday lives.

1392
00:55:06,880 --> 00:55:08,400
How could it not be funny?

1393
00:55:08,400 --> 00:55:11,680
But also, sometimes we'll talk about burps and farts, right?

1394
00:55:11,680 --> 00:55:12,800
Yeah, when not to.

1395
00:55:12,800 --> 00:55:14,080
But we'll still talk about it.

1396
00:55:14,640 --> 00:55:15,440
Yes.

1397
00:55:15,440 --> 00:55:15,840
Great.

1398
00:55:15,840 --> 00:55:18,480
So come join us for our new hilarious show.

1399
00:55:18,480 --> 00:55:20,640
No, RSVP required.

1400
00:55:20,640 --> 00:55:24,000
Coming to you soon every Friday on Maximumfun.org.

1401
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:25,600
It's Shmanners.

1402
00:55:25,600 --> 00:55:27,360
Manners, Shmanners.

1403
00:55:27,360 --> 00:55:27,860
Get it?
