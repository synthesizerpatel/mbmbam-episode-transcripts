1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,820
The McElroy brothers are not experts and their advice should never be followed

2
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:10,580
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it

3
00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:17,660
Also, this show isn't for kids which I mentioned only so the babies out there will know how cool they are for listening

00:02:57,700 --> 00:03:00,340
all the movie podcasts that are

Dudes talking about movies. We make them do it all in one room. Let me just open the door. Yes

The guests on podcast don't normally do that cuz I'm fucking Michael Caine

39
00:03:43,220 --> 00:03:48,440
You know, I feel like Conan should step in here with one of his trademark and I'm Andy

40
00:03:49,180 --> 00:03:54,500
Wait, you're both Andy and like that's actually not about Andy. Yeah, I was doing my impression

41
00:03:54,500 --> 00:04:00,820
It's your Louie Anderson impression actually and those two I don't think are this but Andy is within the name of Louie Anderson

42
00:04:00,820 --> 00:04:02,820
Hey juice, can we switch parts?

61
00:05:22,140 --> 00:05:23,940
office based

we called him props master Dave and

71
00:05:56,540 --> 00:06:02,420

72
00:06:03,180 --> 00:06:09,060
Jamie Lee Curtis dangling from a helicopter and that's the grip that Griffin has on this Kevin voice right now

73
00:06:09,060 --> 00:06:14,340
It's like right there and if he could just pull well the whole point of this was they give me a chance to do my slam

74
00:06:14,340 --> 00:06:16,340
dunk James fader and then he

75
00:06:17,700 --> 00:06:19,700
Spader couldn't make it today

That's gonna be hard for you to James Spader's and you the actor who played Kevin on the office to understand but

00:07:05,740 --> 00:07:12,020
I'm going to do you see this orb? That's floating around. That's where the audience is

99
00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:24,100
Jason Bateman need to eat your orb for fuel. Oh, no, not again

100
00:08:24,100 --> 00:08:29,640
So he's an orb based talent. So this is a that's pretty good. That's pretty good. It's all right

101
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:34,140
This is an advice podcast. Don't now do Donald Duck. Yeah, let's all break

We love it we love that here we love my Mickey Mouse is getting better, but I still don't have it on yeah

103
00:08:41,540 --> 00:08:44,740
No one does nobody has it on it's a real duck. Hey

104
00:08:45,580 --> 00:08:47,580
advice show

105
00:08:47,780 --> 00:08:49,500
Sorry

106
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:51,900
About the inconvenience, but you did show up

107
00:08:51,900 --> 00:08:55,540
Don't complain about this because it was your fault for showing up. So early

108
00:08:56,220 --> 00:09:01,100
Time for advice. I love to take my dog for walks in our beautiful Riverside Park

109
00:09:01,100 --> 00:09:04,400
He's a good boy and other dogs and people love to meet him

110
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:09,380
I'm fine with this as he's super friendly and loves the attention, but I'm socially awkward

111
00:09:09,540 --> 00:09:14,940
So I don't know how to interact with the other people who are petting my dog. Do I pet them too?

112
00:09:15,340 --> 00:09:17,340
Now I look off into the distance

113
00:09:17,340 --> 00:09:24,700
What are some small talk suggestions for people whose dogs have their noses halfway up my dogs, but please help me brothers

114
00:09:24,740 --> 00:09:28,220
That's from mumbling mutt in Memphis. They had to have meant

115
00:09:28,940 --> 00:09:33,060
Do I pet their dog to hear their dog? They could not have meant

116
00:09:33,580 --> 00:09:40,340
Pet their pet the owner had the flesh of the human being who's just trying to live their life next time

117
00:09:40,340 --> 00:09:44,620
Someone says can I pet your dog say can yeah, absolutely. Can't may I pet you?

118
00:09:44,620 --> 00:09:48,420
Yeah, and then my dog will pet me and the circle will be complete

119
00:09:49,100 --> 00:09:52,060
Your dog gets left out. Fuck your dog. Your dog

120
00:09:52,660 --> 00:09:59,620
Guys, we never get questions. This just occurred. We never get questions to start like so my problem is I'm too socially

121
00:09:59,620 --> 00:10:02,860
Well-adjusted I always know what to do in every situation

122
00:10:03,340 --> 00:10:04,700
You don't have a problem

123
00:10:04,700 --> 00:10:10,460
One of those lucky people we it takes three of us to figure out what not one normal person might do. I think

124
00:10:10,460 --> 00:10:15,540
What I would do start petting my dog is I would look away and say I'll give you two a moment

125
00:10:19,780 --> 00:10:22,380
When you're ready, yeah, we have no business you and I

126
00:10:23,820 --> 00:10:25,820
Can you charge money?

127
00:10:26,060 --> 00:10:30,300
$20 I was about to say the words $20 $20 have my dog to pet this

128
00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:32,820
Oh good thing if someone says can I bet your dog say I don't know

129
00:10:32,820 --> 00:10:35,860
Can you and then you don't have to worry about it because they won't keep talking to you

130
00:10:35,860 --> 00:10:39,260
No, I'll have your face with a knife. How about this?

131
00:10:39,260 --> 00:10:44,460
Okay. Yes, you can but you have to promise me that you won't make any wishes promise

132
00:10:44,460 --> 00:10:50,020
I'm gonna make you go really really bad. I've seen some really bad chaotic wishes come out of this dog

133
00:10:50,380 --> 00:10:53,940
Please you have to promise me you're not wishing and you might even think back your mind

134
00:10:53,940 --> 00:10:55,780
Like I wish I could get some Arby's late

135
00:10:55,780 --> 00:11:00,300
Yeah, I think that you've got it airtight and that there is no room for ironic

136
00:11:00,700 --> 00:11:06,580
Classic, but it's this dog. This dog will twist it on you a hundred percent of these don't use up my dog

137
00:11:06,580 --> 00:11:09,660
Which that's the whole reason I bought him. Um

138
00:11:10,580 --> 00:11:12,180
Can you?

139
00:11:12,180 --> 00:11:18,160
Pet the dog too and be like wow that is I've never touched this dog do what to it

140
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:22,540
That are even thought of that very good the first me how you do that

141
00:11:22,540 --> 00:11:27,060
Show me that again flat hand or closed hand if you were gonna express this dog's anal glands

142
00:11:27,060 --> 00:11:29,060
How would you go about that? Just?

143
00:11:29,660 --> 00:11:33,980
Can I bet your dog? Yeah, as soon as they touch it like haha yours now and run away

144
00:11:33,980 --> 00:11:35,620
You

145
00:11:35,620 --> 00:11:38,780
Were the last one to touch it. He's your problem now

146
00:11:40,900 --> 00:11:42,900
Why do you do you love my dog

147
00:11:45,020 --> 00:11:48,300
You love my dog, okay, what are you asking me for ask him?

148
00:11:50,180 --> 00:11:53,020
This makes him ask the dog say can I pay

149
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:57,420
Yes, get down there hands and knees and begged

150
00:11:58,660 --> 00:12:02,200
Say it in dog tongue not in your filthy human speech

151
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:04,400
The dog only let him pay you back

152
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:08,640
It's a

153
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:13,280
Yeah, I mean I feel like there's a certain class of people for whom this is not a bug

154
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:18,920
It's a feature. Yes, where it's like I get to meet lots of other like this is the moment right?

155
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:25,240
The ice has been broken. This is the moment where they would say like so now we've broken the ice

156
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:28,520
Let's chat like people who seek out. Yeah, it's like

157
00:12:28,520 --> 00:12:32,120
a it's like people who are into like

158
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:37,800
Motorcycles and stuff where they just want you to ask them about their motorcycle so that you can ask them like

159
00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:44,920
About their motorcycle and be like good good car people regularly have events because I hear them

160
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:51,460
Yeah, where they just parked their good cars near each other. Yeah, and then they walk around like pretty good pretty good

161
00:12:51,460 --> 00:12:55,040
Well the nice thing about that, especially if they have a dog too, right?

162
00:12:55,040 --> 00:13:00,900
If you have that shared thing you can focus 100% of the conversation on that thing

163
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:08,520
Yeah, right. It's when it starts to branch out if someone's like and tell me about you the human attached to this dog

164
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:14,160
And I'm like, oh no, no, no, but then you've got five like rapid-fire questions

165
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
about dog care like

166
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:18,680
What so?

167
00:13:18,680 --> 00:13:23,920
We love dogs, right? Like like but a good conversation starter. I don't talk about dogs. I don't know

168
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:27,400
I mean you could say like what breed how old are they? Yeah, what's their name?

169
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:33,280
If you want throw something like looks like there's some like Sheba in there

170
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:38,440
Don't have to but nobody knows nobody. Yeah, just pick any kind of like classy looking dog

171
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:44,160
Oh there is there some visual in there and then this person this person is uncomfortable talking to other people Travis

172
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:50,720
I know that you don't understand this but they're uncomfortable talking to other people and what you want them to do is take a swing

173
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:55,360
And a miss like to have the awkwardness of getting their dogs breed wrong. No, here's what I'm saying

174
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:59,080
There is no miss right because here's you're not a dog person

175
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:03,160
There are two things that dog owners love talking about their dogs breed

176
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:10,400
The correct yes, you are right good for noticing or I you would think that but actually either way isn't it?

177
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:13,240
That is the two things that they will talk about

178
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:18,040
The most is if you get it right or get it wrong now, either way doesn't matter

179
00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:22,360
It doesn't matter if they do pay your dog a compliment like oh, he's such a precious special, baby

180
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:25,880
Look at those toe beans. I want to eat him up and say like yeah, but

181
00:14:26,920 --> 00:14:28,920
Did you did you see?

182
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
Clifford the big red dog movie

183
00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:38,260
Because this dog this dog is good but in that one

184
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:41,760
what are some of your favorite dog and that one the dog is a

185
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:49,440
Very unique color and so big that a grown-up can ride on him like a big horse

186
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:55,680
And you can't do that with my dog. So it's it's a fine. It's a fine dog

187
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:59,080
It is no Clifford the big red dog now, which now I would

188
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:03,800
Trade I trade him for Clifford in a heartbeat. I would put this dog above

189
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:06,280
Beethoven though cuz that dog

190
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:12,680
Oh and I see that look on your face a lot of people get confused by this Beethoven's is actually about a dog not about the

191
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:15,000
Composer, I know what you're thinking because you see it's a

192
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:18,280
Beethoven is the Charles Grodin character

193
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:22,480
The dog is called Beethoven's dog. Yeah

194
00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:27,760
And strangely Charles Grodin is called Beethoven's owner and no one's quite sure

195
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:32,360
There's a middleman we haven't pinned down yet

196
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:36,760
Between Charles Grodin and the dog that connects the two of them. We're not sure

197
00:15:36,760 --> 00:15:39,260
But do you think Turner and Hooch are married in real life?

198
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:42,200
God, I still miss Gordy every day

199
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:45,320
they made a series of

200
00:15:46,760 --> 00:15:51,840
Successful films of of it's a big dog man. I don't know what to tell you. He's a big dog

201
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:58,880
I see not shit over it is that it is 50 though. It's a genius formula. It's 50 said that 50 said man

202
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:04,300
I love it when when Charles Grodin hates stuff. Yeah, whenever you ever sit here or wine that guy up and see him

203
00:16:04,300 --> 00:16:06,840
Get like really really grumpy. Oh, it's good

204
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:12,580
It's like a weird manic smile on when he's really mad that if I was there in real person, I'd be terrified

205
00:16:12,580 --> 00:16:15,320
But we watch him. I'm just eating my popcorn and loving it

206
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:19,240
They put they pointed this out of like check, but he was in Clifford. You remember Clifford?

207
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:23,780
Yeah with Martin short a little red fucking dog. Yes, Justin. We talked about it

208
00:16:23,780 --> 00:16:28,460
Boy, no, he's a little white boy. That's what it's called Clifford the little white boy

209
00:16:29,500 --> 00:16:31,500
played by the old I

210
00:16:32,540 --> 00:16:38,340
Just realized what was the pitch for the Clifford movie with Martin short it. No, here's the thing

211
00:16:38,860 --> 00:16:41,860
He's a devil. He's a demon child

212
00:16:42,460 --> 00:16:46,020
Played by an adult and also Charles Grodin is there. Sorry

213
00:16:46,020 --> 00:16:52,540
It's it's a skewing to this is too close to anti Martin short dog. We want no I would never I would never abide

214
00:16:52,540 --> 00:17:00,180
I would never is one other question. Yeah, cuz I just discovered that the wiki how I had pulled we have done before and so

215
00:17:00,180 --> 00:17:04,320
I do believe that the wizard is going to be on vacation for this particular episode

216
00:17:04,980 --> 00:17:06,980
Well, how about another question that you know what?

217
00:17:08,100 --> 00:17:12,540
You would have noticed that if they had arrived when they were supposed to arrive. Yeah

218
00:17:13,340 --> 00:17:15,340
Early you would have had this is their fault

219
00:17:16,580 --> 00:17:20,800
My mom and I love to watch shows together. I they actually said like

220
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:26,880
So I'm putting a little yeah. Hey Justin, how about you don't editorialize? They're still getting to know each other

221
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:30,500
My mom and I like to watch shows together and recently

222
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:35,240
What if the question was like my mom and I like to watch shows together?

223
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:38,520
Can you guys recommend several new shows that you've been enjoying?

224
00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:45,440
No jokes and jokes out of the room. The jokes part is the work to talk about. What if they were just like what shows?

225
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:50,480
What are you guys watching right now? Don't make bits about it. Don't describe it too much. Just say like the name

226
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:52,480
I've been watching resident alien. It's good

227
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:56,720
Do you have friends that when you see them at a party you only talk about the shows?

228
00:17:56,720 --> 00:18:02,800
Yeah, watching. Yeah, and once you once you have gone through all the shows you've been watching you get this feeling like I don't know

229
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:04,800
This person very well

230
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:09,680
I'm an adult. Of course. I have those people think we have that much in common

231
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:13,880
Nothing. I think oh, it's fun when you find out they also like board games or something and it's like well

232
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:17,680
Have you played this board game and that opens up another 20 to 30 minutes of conversation?

233
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:23,760
Yeah, and at that point you feel okay about leaving the party you've been there long enough 40 minutes is a good amount of time

234
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:32,160
Do you want to read more than the first five words of this? Yeah, I was just making some conversation for the podcast. Sorry

235
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:34,480
um

236
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:36,480
Let's see now you got me on

237
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:39,440
Recently, we've been watching the great british bake-off nice

238
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:43,120
We invited my dad to come watch with us and ever since he's been watching it often

239
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:47,920
Every time I go downstairs. He's watching it. I heard him stay up till one in the morning last night watching it

240
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:51,600
He said he couldn't pick me up from school today, and I had to get a ride for a friend

241
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:54,000
And when I got home, he was watching it

242
00:18:55,200 --> 00:19:00,640
Should I interfere that's from baffled by bake-off in ohio. Oh, he found something. Wow

243
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:06,240
I miss this feeling. Oh when you find something don't you oh you find a show

244
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:11,440
And there's so many of them. Yeah, and you could just watch all of them if you want god

245
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:16,820
I miss that also for it to be great british bake-off in this day and age. Oh the joy the serotonin

246
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:25,360
You're in for some pivots. You need to be a yeah, but I mean imagine if you got him onto like uh, breaking bad

247
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:28,800
And it's just like i'm worried about the influences is gonna have on my dad

248
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:33,360
But great british bake-off the worst thing is gonna happen. You got some more baked goods in the house now

249
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:40,400
He might start affecting a british accent. Yeah, and we love that it it the thing with breaking bad is it doesn't have

250
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:42,400
It doesn't have

251
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:45,620
Sir paul hollywood's just like cerulean

252
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:51,440
Pools that you just sweat that he just shoots his sex beams out of through the tv screen

253
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:54,160
Have you not seen the super cuts of all the times?

254
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:59,920
When uh, walter white finished making a batch and paul hollywood step in and try it and be like, that's a good bake and shake his hand

255
00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:02,560
Do you remember that? Yeah

256
00:20:04,560 --> 00:20:07,680
That crunchy rock and he'd like eat a big rock of it and he'd be like

257
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:12,160
Like it's a little soggy in the bottom and then he'd be like zeep zop. Zooby dee borp

258
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:14,480
I don't know what you do when you have done mel

259
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:18,160
I don't i've not done meth and I don't really know

260
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:23,840
I don't know what it's like like I can imagine what doing other drugs is like but meth

261
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:30,000
I assume you just go like bb boop. Zeep zop a leap board and it turns you into like a alien man

262
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:32,800
It turns you into an andy sandberg character. Yeah, apparently

263
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:34,320
Yeah

264
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:37,920
Uh, this is fine as long as it does lead to getting goods baked for you

265
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:43,840
Because that is the outcome so often with with great british bake often. It's also a good uh, uh,

266
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:48,240
It's a good onboarding to like taskmaster, which is another good one you want to watch together

267
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:51,280
No, now you're just doing the thing that we said we wanted to I know

268
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:55,120
Now there is a okay

269
00:20:55,680 --> 00:20:56,800
There is

270
00:20:56,800 --> 00:21:00,800
A seedy underbelly of possible outcome of him watching too much of this

271
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:04,240
It's like next family get together grandma brings out a little pie. He takes a bite

272
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:09,200
He's like soggy bottom and shoves it away, right where he's oh and he's like you call this a scone

273
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:13,040
And like throws it back in her face like prude did that one time, you know that kind of thing

274
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:17,040
Or he's like, oh you guys hear about bengate and it's like that. We can't keep bringing up bengate

275
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:21,040
It's been a long time that kind that's the downside. That's the dark

276
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:24,160
I will say that I do enjoy

277
00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:27,840
on a whole baked goods less

278
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:34,160
Because now I know what to look for what they could have been. Yeah, like when I eat a bread

279
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:36,800
And it's like super chewy

280
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:42,400
Before I knew anything I was like, oh chewy bread, but now I know like they didn't prove it

281
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:47,520
They didn't prove it enough. They didn't prove the yeast they improved the existence of bread

282
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:51,200
No, I i'm glad now because just from watching great British bake-off

283
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:56,160
I've been able to add the word claggy into my vocabulary and I don't know what it means and I don't think they do either

284
00:21:56,160 --> 00:22:02,320
But it seems like a good way to really put down someone's baking. It's like it's a bit claggy. It's a little stodgy

285
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:07,040
You don't have to interfere you don't have to intercede just let them enjoy the baking

286
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:12,000
Maybe set a timer so he doesn't stay up to one o'clock or miss picking up from school. That is worrisome

287
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:18,960
I I I do. Okay. I love cooking shows. I love great British bake-off. I mean, I love

288
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:25,200
Zumbo's best desserts. Oh, yeah, I love is it cake sweet genius with ron ben israel?

289
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:27,200
uh, is it cake

290
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:30,640
But the other ones I love

291
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:32,240
and uh

292
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:37,120
I i'm hard on is it cake because there was a version called eye candy starring josh groban on roku

293
00:22:37,680 --> 00:22:42,400
Or what was a quibi and then it was on right? Anyway, sorry doesn't have anything to do with anything

294
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:49,920
uh, is it possible your father is obsessed just with the episode where they had to make cake busts of famous people and someone made

295
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:52,240
nightmare tom delong

296
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:58,000
I love those shows. I have never felt like I gotta fucking watch the next one. Really?

297
00:22:58,800 --> 00:23:02,800
I've got to see what happens next. It's the reason I didn't watch a long podcast called bacon

298
00:23:03,040 --> 00:23:08,480
Uh, I think of the last two seasons. That's how we feel when we watch it. We have watched uh the season

299
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:14,960
Uh, like the first season that aired on netflix we watched that shit. Uh, uh, like once a month

300
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:17,840
We watched that same series over and over again

301
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:21,120
I feel bad that the wizard let us down this week

302
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:25,280
Yeah, it is a little sad, isn't it? Do you guys want to learn how to fight with us?

303
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:27,840
Hey, we're recording this on uh, september first griffin

304
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:31,120
Don't monthly observance do not do this to me

305
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:34,880
Aren't you guys curious what kind of month it's going to be in september? I'm so curious

306
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:37,520
God dang it

307
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:39,520
Yeah, so we got some special month

308
00:23:40,380 --> 00:23:41,600
observances

309
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:51,280
To do happy september happy september first everybody. Did you know that this is the month if if you do have a new fall hat?

310
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:54,640
That you are excited about it is fall hat month

311
00:23:55,360 --> 00:24:00,240
No, it's not fall is here. It's getting colder. So it's time to break out the headgear. It's fall hat month

312
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:04,080
During fall hat month switch out of the cool weather head protection

313
00:24:04,560 --> 00:24:10,480
And into stylish felt and fabric styles no period on the end of that sentence. No period just laying it all out there

314
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:12,240
Someone was murdered

315
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:15,120
Writing that first paragraph and then somebody hopped back in

316
00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:21,440
For the next paragraph hats were probably one of the first items of clothing found among primitive humankind

317
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:23,280
what

318
00:24:23,280 --> 00:24:25,280
Where are we going with this?

319
00:24:25,280 --> 00:24:30,720
That can't possibly be right when we're walking around with our butt and gooch and privates just out

320
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:36,560
And someone's like I have to get my hair hidden birds and bugs keep getting in there

321
00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:40,640
Um, so it's fall hat month everybody

322
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:42,320
and

323
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:43,280
I guess

324
00:24:43,280 --> 00:24:45,760
Hats have played an impressive role in human history

325
00:24:46,060 --> 00:24:52,240
Presumably us president william henry harrison died shortly after his inaugural dress because he refused to wear a cap on that cold

326
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:56,000
Nasty day now hold on justice. Was it just if my man

327
00:24:56,800 --> 00:24:58,400
had had

328
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:05,680
A nice derby on he would still be with us today is what you're saying prove that you can't prove that you assume

329
00:25:05,680 --> 00:25:08,160
If well, but there's no way to prove that

330
00:25:08,560 --> 00:25:12,960
It wasn't a magic hat that a witch gave him and said as long as you wear this you'll never get sick

331
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:18,720
You don't know unless wait. No, I refuse to unless that that is so nice. But what if it was?

332
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:22,900
No, no, no, no, i'm closing this what if it was a magic hat they give all precedents

333
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:30,320
Better breakfast month better breakfast. Fuck you judgmental. You don't know what i'm eating. You don't know maybe I can't get better

334
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:36,160
Hey, you can always get better. I'm looking at a picture. It looks like it has seven banana slices and some chia seeds

335
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:38,400
No, thank you. That's it

336
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:45,200
No, thank you any breakfast be better than that can't be it that can't be i've seen pictures of a balanced breakfast

337
00:25:45,280 --> 00:25:50,720
And it didn't contain chia seeds it contained frosted flakes a glass of milk and orange juice for some reason

338
00:25:51,040 --> 00:25:52,640
Yeah, it toasts

339
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:56,900
If I ate a balanced breakfast as recommended by cereal commercials

340
00:25:56,900 --> 00:26:03,620
I would be on the toilet until lunch time. It's so much fucking food

341
00:26:04,180 --> 00:26:06,340
It's so much food. It's milk

342
00:26:06,980 --> 00:26:11,540
And orange juice you want me to the orange juice also it is in a pitcher

343
00:26:12,020 --> 00:26:18,100
Did I did I need did I wait? Did I take the extra minute to get out a pitcher and fill my kids?

344
00:26:18,660 --> 00:26:24,180
Pitcher with it's better breakfast month decant your juice for your dirt bad kids

345
00:26:24,180 --> 00:26:26,340
Decant your juice and give your kids

346
00:26:26,980 --> 00:26:33,540
These fucking hard hardened charcoal tablets to enjoy with their seven banana slices

347
00:26:34,340 --> 00:26:39,700
Can we go back to uh as long as we're talking about can we go back to original fruit loop recipe, please?

348
00:26:40,100 --> 00:26:44,820
Just before they use the art back when they use the artificial colors and the artificial sweeteners

349
00:26:44,900 --> 00:26:48,660
I like the old school tricks recipe as well, please. I'm listen

350
00:26:48,660 --> 00:26:51,780
I'm an adult now and I would like to make these decisions for you. They did

351
00:26:51,780 --> 00:26:59,220
They don't okay. You're saying a lot of wild stuff. They did go back to the original tricks. Look people hated the no artificial colors

352
00:26:59,220 --> 00:27:04,180
Thank you. So you're covered there. Thank you. Awesome. Save your photos. Save your photos month

353
00:27:04,900 --> 00:27:06,580
Save your photos month

354
00:27:06,580 --> 00:27:09,140
Now in case of I guess a storm

355
00:27:09,780 --> 00:27:15,220
That comes to try to take your photos away. I guess put them in the cloud that that one doesn't feel like it needs

356
00:27:15,780 --> 00:27:19,060
That won't take me. I don't have the urgency of spending a month doing this

357
00:27:19,060 --> 00:27:27,060
Um, I'm almost certain we've talked about international update your resume month, which like for us would be kind of I don't want

358
00:27:27,620 --> 00:27:33,140
I don't want the two of you to ever update your resumes because that would affect me

359
00:27:33,780 --> 00:27:36,740
That would have implications for me and my life

360
00:27:37,300 --> 00:27:39,780
If I find out the two of you are updating your resume

361
00:27:40,340 --> 00:27:46,020
I would probably quit first just so you don't get the satisfaction of pulling the rug

362
00:27:46,020 --> 00:27:50,100
Just so you don't get the satisfaction of pulling the rug out from me

363
00:27:50,820 --> 00:27:58,200
Well good news. I can tell you this personally. Yeah, unless the employer is interested in a decade of podcast experience

364
00:27:58,740 --> 00:28:03,540
I don't have a lot go unless they're like, well, yeah. Oh we see here that back from

365
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:06,740
2007 to 2009 you worked at best buy

366
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:12,500
Interesting. Yes, please be the manager of this big company. I don't see that happen

367
00:28:12,500 --> 00:28:16,660
I'm not bringing a lot to the table outside of what i'm currently doing looks

368
00:28:16,980 --> 00:28:20,900
Looks like I haven't updated my resume in about eight years

369
00:28:21,300 --> 00:28:25,940
So I really don't know if I have I don't have one. I have an acting resume

370
00:28:26,580 --> 00:28:28,980
from my time upon the boards

371

I have a curriculum verite those I use for my professorships special skills being really good at acting

372
00:28:38,020 --> 00:28:40,020
That's not one but that's a secret for you

373
00:28:40,020 --> 00:28:43,940
You can put that as a special skill in anything being good at doing this job

374
00:28:44,820 --> 00:28:46,820
um, baby safety month

375
00:28:46,820 --> 00:28:49,700
Gotta take that serious. That should be every month

376
00:28:50,420 --> 00:28:57,700
It's hugely a problem. That is a massive the idea that you have been putting off making your home safe for your baby

377
00:28:58,020 --> 00:29:00,020
and then you see like

00:29:00,100 --> 00:29:06,260
Something pop up on myspace. It's like good news. It's baby safety month like ah, fantastic baby safety month

379
00:29:06,340 --> 00:29:08,260

Shit

422
00:32:21,300 --> 00:32:24,100
That would be great if somebody had to go to moral combat island

423
00:32:24,180 --> 00:32:29,220
Like i'm here to fight lu kang and lu kang's like i'm lu kang and it's like you killed a guy

424
00:32:29,540 --> 00:32:31,860
So here's i'm actually you've been served

425
00:32:32,180 --> 00:32:38,260
I'm cops and here's a subpoena for you to be arrested for that gig for killing actually everyone here

426
00:32:38,580 --> 00:32:40,740
Just go ahead and get on this boat

427
00:32:40,740 --> 00:32:45,300
Yeah, this boat goes to jail and arrest the person to your left

428
00:32:45,780 --> 00:32:50,820
Uh, I don't have enough manacles for everybody. Uh, I didn't expect goro to have so many arms. That's on me

429
00:32:51,140 --> 00:32:52,980
So i'm one I am one set short

430
00:32:52,980 --> 00:32:59,640
I thought I could just do two sets of manacles on goro, but I kind of have to do a crisscross applesauce

431
00:33:02,020 --> 00:33:05,620
That's a good question justin do you go side to side or you go exes

432
00:33:05,620 --> 00:33:12,580
Yeah, if he could still go up and down and squish things, that's not good. Right? Yeah. Yeah, so speaking of

433
00:33:13,380 --> 00:33:17,140
Goro bondage play bombas is their mission is simple

434
00:33:17,780 --> 00:33:22,180
They make the most comfortable clothes ever and match every item sold with an equal item donated

435
00:33:22,260 --> 00:33:25,220
So I bet goro is a sub though. So when you buy

436
00:33:26,340 --> 00:33:29,380
You are also giving to someone in need

437
00:33:30,100 --> 00:33:33,940
Bombas designed their socks shirts and underwear to be the clothes. You can't wait to put on every day

438
00:33:33,940 --> 00:33:38,580
Everything they make is soft seamless tagless and has a cozy feel

439
00:33:39,140 --> 00:33:41,780
Unlike do you guys think sub-zero on scorpion ever kiss?

440
00:33:42,500 --> 00:33:48,420
And did you know that socks underwear and t-shirts are the three most requested clothing items at home? Are they related?

441
00:33:48,740 --> 00:33:52,980
Are they are there's also smoke and there's like a snake one reptile

442
00:33:53,060 --> 00:33:57,460
That's why bombas donates one for every item you buy so far bombas customers

443
00:33:57,460 --> 00:34:00,980
Like you have helped donate over 50 million items of essential clothing

444
00:34:00,980 --> 00:34:06,340
We're kind of the same clothing. So you have the same size. Yeah, are they related?

445
00:34:07,380 --> 00:34:09,380
I think they're sometimes they are sometimes

446
00:34:09,780 --> 00:34:13,160

504
00:39:04,160 --> 00:39:10,640

505
00:39:10,720 --> 00:39:12,720
Okay, so it wasn't that

00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:10,480
Yeah, you die. What happens if you win?

517
00:40:10,640 --> 00:40:16,240
You see the old prospector from uh, or the undertaker from mad dog becree and he comes out very easy

518
00:40:16,240 --> 00:40:22,240
You've run out of time reversal cubes. Yeah, don't stop beliefing. It says okay, you would just make

519
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:28,800
Okay, our our score is four. We got four pumpkins. We're foliage friendly

520
00:40:29,360 --> 00:40:32,800
You sleep to the sound. Oh, I did it on my own justin and I got all of them

521
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:35,440
Right and it called me a pumpkin fucker. Yeah

522
00:40:35,440 --> 00:40:42,080
Yeah, it said you so the psl is back now. This is just a public service announcement. It's topped with whipped cream

523
00:40:42,160 --> 00:40:47,200
It's got pumpkin spices. No way ice or blended. I mean the whole bit. I mean the whole bit

524
00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:53,680
But what if there's pumpkin spice obviously, but what is it? What are the other drinks justin that they're partnering the button real spice experience with

525
00:40:54,480 --> 00:40:58,320
Well, there's a pumpkin cream cold brew, which is back for another new year

526
00:40:58,400 --> 00:41:03,600
I like that one and it's a fan that one's a fan favorite. Yeah, I get nasty for that one. If you keep bringing something back four times

527
00:41:03,600 --> 00:41:10,080
Then I would hope that fans enjoy it because otherwise I don't know what you're doing with all that

528
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:14,080
Pumpkin cold brew. Oh shit. I could be buying pumpkin flavored beer right now

529
00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:17,040
Yeah, you should be actually

530
00:41:17,040 --> 00:41:20,800
Um, oh, they've got some festive fall merchandise. Uh, just so you know

531
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:26,400
They're uh dipping into the starbucks coffee reserves. I mean it's it's gonna be a big fall over there

532
00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:30,640
I don't know that we have this is like are they trying to lower the price of coffee by the gallon?

533
00:41:30,640 --> 00:41:33,920
What do you mean to open up the reserves?

534
00:41:35,120 --> 00:41:37,680
No, it's like a fancier coffee. It's like a better fan

535
00:41:37,840 --> 00:41:41,840
They have better coffee and they're just like we could be giving you better coffee than what we have

536
00:41:41,840 --> 00:41:46,160
But we're holding this back. You dirty birds. I mean, it's a commodity right supply and demand

537
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:51,840
You can pay for the as good of a coffee as you can afford you guys like pumpkin spice lattes basic

00:42:53,600 --> 00:42:55,600
um

554
00:42:56,160 --> 00:43:01,760
Hardee's is making a beer. I mean what usual the usual what hardy's making beer is fun

555
00:43:02,800 --> 00:43:09,040
Yeah, hardy's is teamed with southern grist brewing company on a strawberry biscuit ale. So it's like you ever

556
00:43:09,680 --> 00:43:15,920
I eat a strawberry biscuit at hardy's and think god. I wish this get me wrecked. Yeah, dude. Now your dreams can come true

557
00:43:16,560 --> 00:43:21,520
Yeah, drink a delicious beer. That is actually a biscuit from hardy's all mushed up and fermented

558
00:43:21,520 --> 00:43:23,520
delicious

559
00:43:23,620 --> 00:43:29,380
Does anyone else on this call or in the world have the experience of it becomes fall you get really excited you buy like fall beer

560
00:43:29,860 --> 00:43:35,300
Uh, so you buy a bunch of it and then you have like six of them in a week or whatever and you're like

561
00:43:35,380 --> 00:43:37,380
Oh, i'm tired of this already

562
00:43:37,540 --> 00:43:42,260
And then those pumpkin beers sit in your fridge for many months until it gets to be like summer and you're like well

563
00:43:42,340 --> 00:43:44,580
I haven't been to the store in a while and i'm out of here

564
00:43:44,740 --> 00:43:48,980
So you crack open like a pumpkin beer in the middle of july and you're like, oh, this actually is terrible

565
00:43:48,980 --> 00:43:56,340
I hate this. Yeah, but then fall comes around again and you're like, oh hell yeah pumpkin beer season. Yeah, that's sort of just the

566
00:43:57,060 --> 00:43:58,420
futility of

567
00:43:58,420 --> 00:43:59,860
Of it all, huh?

568
00:43:59,860 --> 00:44:01,060
Yeah, man

569
00:44:01,060 --> 00:44:05,380
There's an artemis moon donut at crispy cream delicious. Yeah

570
00:44:05,460 --> 00:44:10,020
It's a one day special for the to celebrate the planned launch of artemis one

571
00:44:10,420 --> 00:44:17,300
Can you and they fucking post I have beef with nazza because I get my kid I get my class together

572
00:44:17,300 --> 00:44:22,740
And sit in front of the big tv screen and I say they're about to shoot that shit right up into outer space

573
00:44:22,820 --> 00:44:25,720
It's got nobody on it, which is wasteful

574
00:44:26,420 --> 00:44:28,580
It's like do you see cars on the highway?

575
00:44:29,220 --> 00:44:32,020
With no one in them emissions much

576
00:44:32,740 --> 00:44:38,100
And I was my class was psyched and then the last minute they're like something was wrong with one of the engines

577
00:44:38,180 --> 00:44:43,460
So we didn't do it and it's like no one's in the rocket if it does a big explode

578
00:44:43,460 --> 00:44:49,780
My class is going to talk like remember that forever and talk about that. I didn't know there was no one in it

579
00:44:50,100 --> 00:44:56,820
And that actually explains to me why they were so candid about the engine problems because you know, if that's a manned mission

580
00:44:56,900 --> 00:45:01,060
They don't just say like we had engine they were this close

581
00:45:01,540 --> 00:45:03,700
Right, we almost shuffled a few

582
00:45:04,020 --> 00:45:10,420
There was a big whoopsie that devin should have caught and he didn't and if that shit had gone up there

583
00:45:10,420 --> 00:45:14,580
It would have been yikes city end of astronauts

584
00:45:16,020 --> 00:45:19,780
Imagine being an astronaut who's like on that and they're like, yeah, we had a lot of mechanical issues

585
00:45:19,860 --> 00:45:24,260
But it'll be fine by tomorrow get ready to go and you're like what no

586
00:45:25,700 --> 00:45:31,780
It is still kind of hilarious. I understand what happens. I'm basically i've watched a lot of different movies

587
00:45:32,340 --> 00:45:38,980
But it is kind of funny that we're gonna black like blast a rocket into the sky. It's cost like billions of dollars

588
00:45:38,980 --> 00:45:44,820
To get to this point and then it starts raining and everyone's like fuck

589
00:45:47,380 --> 00:45:49,380
No, no, no

590
00:45:49,700 --> 00:45:55,300
No, no, sorry. Sorry. We tried to oppose your will with our incredible brains. You win

591
00:45:55,460 --> 00:45:58,180
Is this is it bad for the rocket? No, it's just

592
00:45:58,580 --> 00:46:01,460
We wanted that morning glow on it when we took all the pictures

593
00:46:01,940 --> 00:46:07,860
And we've like been staging it we put a bunch of like doilies around it and stuff rocket get wet. It looks

594
00:46:07,860 --> 00:46:09,860
It looks so dumb

595
00:46:13,620 --> 00:46:17,060
The decals get loose it's it everything gets wrinkled

596
00:46:18,020 --> 00:46:20,420
There's a lot of steam when the rocket goes

597
00:46:21,700 --> 00:46:27,460
The wet rock they do that they do that if for takeoff, but they don't do it for landing

598
00:46:27,620 --> 00:46:30,340
Yeah, they're never like it's raining go around

599
00:46:30,340 --> 00:46:35,160
Oh my god, we're gonna reroute you to phoenix

600
00:46:38,660 --> 00:46:44,660
Madagascar is dry. Take a left go to the ocean people are watching

601
00:46:47,060 --> 00:46:48,020
Be careful

602
00:46:48,020 --> 00:46:52,340
There's a reason they don't fish the rockets out of the ocean once they do go splash smash

603
00:46:52,740 --> 00:46:56,580
And that's because they look so fucking stupid. Well, yeah like a wet penis

604
00:46:56,580 --> 00:47:00,980
Is yeah, it's a big stupid. It's so stupid. It's just stupid

605
00:47:01,940 --> 00:47:06,100
My first job out of college. I ran art groups for teens out of necessity

606
00:47:06,340 --> 00:47:11,060
I trained myself into a lot of habits to help maintain boundaries and dissuade unwanted attention

607
00:47:11,380 --> 00:47:17,460
One of these things included if I ever need to bend over I did it in the most unflattering way possible years later

608
00:47:17,460 --> 00:47:19,460
I still have this habit

609
00:47:19,620 --> 00:47:24,820
Problem is I now have a serious girlfriend. I'm afraid I've trained my body to move in this not erotic way forever

610
00:47:24,820 --> 00:47:31,800
This is brothers. What can I do to drop this habit and learn to bend over sexy? That's for rescue in rochester

611
00:47:33,700 --> 00:47:36,420
It takes your it takes a long time to train that out of you

612
00:47:36,820 --> 00:47:41,620
Take it from me. I've had to work so hard to drain every bit of sexy out of my body

613
00:47:42,020 --> 00:47:45,140
Yeah took years it for me. It just took um

614
00:47:46,100 --> 00:47:48,360
Oh god, oh travis dropped this camera

615
00:47:48,360 --> 00:47:53,640
Yeah, wow, you really dropped it huh

616
00:47:54,600 --> 00:47:57,640
Wow, I feel like i'm watching a colonoscopy for a robot

617
00:47:59,880 --> 00:48:02,680
Wow, you dropped the shit out of that tribe you still haven't fixed it

618
00:48:03,560 --> 00:48:07,480
He's still trying to fix it. It might have come unconnected disconnected. Wow

619
00:48:11,560 --> 00:48:13,560
Well

620
00:48:13,560 --> 00:48:16,840
We don't need to see you I guess. Um, yeah, we just won't film the rest

621
00:48:16,840 --> 00:48:22,200
Okay, i'm curious. I wish i'd gotten a little bit more maybe you could share screen of a picture of you

622
00:48:24,760 --> 00:48:31,160
If we could have gotten some description of what your unsexy bend over method looks like if that would have been hugely helpful

623
00:48:31,240 --> 00:48:36,200
Yeah, I think we can just take the bend and snap from legally blonde and do the antithesis of that

624
00:48:36,280 --> 00:48:39,400
Yeah, so it's like kind of your squinching down to the side for sure

625
00:48:39,480 --> 00:48:43,640
What if you just like your hip is going one way your knees go the other you just fall to the ground

626
00:48:43,640 --> 00:48:49,240
And you have to stand back up and then but see standing back up in a non-state like what's that look like?

627
00:48:52,280 --> 00:48:56,200
The amount of overthinking that went into this is truly

628
00:48:56,900 --> 00:48:58,040
humbling

629
00:48:58,040 --> 00:49:02,600
Like I thought I thought that I overthink everything but to be like i'm an art teacher

630
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:06,220
I can't possibly bend over a sexy way if I drop a paintbrush

631
00:49:06,680 --> 00:49:10,200
So i'm gonna develop this new I sort of twist my body

632
00:49:10,200 --> 00:49:15,100
Sideways a little bit and then I do if golem was picking up a paintbrush

633
00:49:15,100 --> 00:49:17,500
Yeah, I go down gorilla style baby

634
00:49:17,820 --> 00:49:23,180
And then I get the paintbrush and I stand up so fast that no one could ever look at me and be like that's oh

635
00:49:23,420 --> 00:49:25,420
That's an erotic pose right there

636
00:49:26,140 --> 00:49:30,940
Perfect. I love it. How do you bring it back? The question is not how to undo the sexy. They've done that

637
00:49:31,420 --> 00:49:36,540
How do you bring it back? Oh, thank you. Justin. Thank you for screen sharing a picture of me talking to a microphone now

638
00:49:36,540 --> 00:49:39,500
You did pick in my big beard face. Yeah

639
00:49:39,500 --> 00:49:45,420
Uh, i'm sorry trap. I should have measured your beard length against your current to find the exact

640
00:49:46,140 --> 00:49:48,780
Image or maybe you can stop being such a clumsy

641
00:49:49,420 --> 00:49:51,980
Fuck and keep your camera on your desk

642
00:49:52,700 --> 00:49:58,220
Well, right. Okay. Um, I turned it off because I feared I was too sexy and it would distract you guys

643
00:49:58,780 --> 00:50:00,780
um, but now

644
00:50:00,860 --> 00:50:06,380
You've made me feel terrible about it and I don't know how to turn with so the weird thing is the camera light is on

645
00:50:06,860 --> 00:50:08,860
So it wants to be on

646
00:50:08,860 --> 00:50:09,660
You got it

647
00:50:09,660 --> 00:50:13,980
I'm going to go over to bnh.com and see if they got manuals and I will I will get back

648
00:50:13,980 --> 00:50:17,100
All right, and then all how about this you guys do that and i'll do the show

649
00:50:18,860 --> 00:50:23,260
You guys go do some other thing and i'll do the show people are listening to right I got the orb right in front of me

650
00:50:23,740 --> 00:50:30,060
It's not it's not my fault griffin. We weren't ready. Okay, right? Travis would have had his camera in the perfect place

651
00:50:30,540 --> 00:50:36,060
So secure. Yeah, all of this would be all set up already. Yeah, right. We weren't ready for so the

652
00:50:36,060 --> 00:50:41,020
The bend snap, you know, look at that picture, you know about yeah about how to bend over sexy

653
00:50:41,100 --> 00:50:47,660
A lot of people like you're eating a mouse won't tell you wow that you have got to squish your butt cheeks together

654
00:50:49,020 --> 00:50:50,540
With your hands

655
00:50:50,540 --> 00:50:51,740
Oh

656
00:50:51,740 --> 00:50:57,100
To get a sexy bend going to do a sexy bend if you can't squish your butt cheeks together using just butt

657
00:50:57,580 --> 00:51:01,980
Muscle, it's okay to use your I i'll write you a note that says it's okay

658
00:51:01,980 --> 00:51:07,260
Until you make it i'll write a note that says it's okay for you to use your hands to squish your butt cheeks together

659
00:51:07,420 --> 00:51:12,860
Like a doctor's note and so when your your partner is like, why did you do that?

660
00:51:13,260 --> 00:51:14,380
I mean it looked great

661
00:51:14,380 --> 00:51:17,420
But did you need to use your hands you can show them the note that says

662
00:51:17,660 --> 00:51:21,660
Griffin said it's okay for me to do it like that. Griffin said it's actually very important and fine

663
00:51:21,740 --> 00:51:26,460
I would also say, uh, you know, what makes everything sexier. What's that doing it a little slower?

664
00:51:26,940 --> 00:51:31,020
So the slower you can bend over and stand back up the slower you can do it

665
00:51:31,020 --> 00:51:37,420
Yeah, this also more eye contact so slow lots of eye contact and now that's gonna be hard if they're behind you

666
00:51:37,500 --> 00:51:40,140
You gotta turn behind so slow slow

667
00:51:40,700 --> 00:51:47,500
Quick quick slow. Yeah, no, no, no slow quick slow slow quick and the whole time just push them

668
00:51:48,700 --> 00:51:53,100
What push them together with your hands push them together with your hands eye contact no matter where they are in the room

669
00:51:53,340 --> 00:51:56,620
If they move around you stay locked in on them the whole time

670
00:51:56,620 --> 00:52:01,100
And when when you're picking the thing up you have to say oh there it is

671
00:52:01,660 --> 00:52:04,860
Every time make sure you see like, okay

672
00:52:05,100 --> 00:52:10,140
Lock into the object first and then make eye contact because you don't want to whiff on it a couple times

673
00:52:10,140 --> 00:52:14,540
Because then you're gonna be like, oh there. No. Oh there. What? Oh, there it is

674
00:52:14,700 --> 00:52:17,500
Can you tear your pants and make it seem like an accident?

675
00:52:18,860 --> 00:52:20,860
Oh to get it all out

676
00:52:21,660 --> 00:52:23,180
Yeah

677
00:52:23,180 --> 00:52:26,700
How do you sorry? How do you mean tear your pants and make it look like an accident?

678
00:52:26,700 --> 00:52:33,180
Well, you're already holding your butt. Yeah. Yeah. Well, they're gonna know they're gonna think you tore your pants with your hands, which is not

679
00:52:34,060 --> 00:52:37,420
Sexy. Oh, can you hold your butt and then move your butt like it's talking

680
00:52:37,500 --> 00:52:43,020
You know that clip of uh, linny cravitz on stage and then he kind of does like a little dip

681
00:52:43,420 --> 00:52:49,180
And then and his crap his leather his leather pants split and his like whole hog

682
00:52:49,180 --> 00:52:53,520
springs forth as if it's been in prison this whole time like

683
00:52:56,080 --> 00:52:59,520
It's so it's so tight inside of linny cravitz's pants

684
00:53:01,040 --> 00:53:05,440
I just had to get out of there like something like that. I'm the real prince

685
00:53:06,800 --> 00:53:08,800
What it's like the man in the iron mask

686
00:53:10,880 --> 00:53:12,000
Yeah

687
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:14,320
I don't know why that was so hard for for me to get

688
00:53:14,320 --> 00:53:21,200
