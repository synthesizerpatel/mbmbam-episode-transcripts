1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:30,800
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:51,600
The trees are beginning to change color. The days are getting shorter. Ridiculously

6
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:56,720
attractive eighth grade science teachers are getting ready. They're laying their traps,

7
00:00:56,720 --> 00:01:02,960
and that can only mean one thing. School is back in session, almost, for some people.

8
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:06,160
A young man's fancy has turned to homework.

9
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:08,880
That's right, exactly. School's back.

10
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:09,840
And bonus.

11
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:12,560
And bonus. Homework and awkward bonus.

12
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:13,600
So sexy.

13
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:17,440
This is my brother, my brother, and me, an advice show for the modern era. Today we're going

14
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:22,240
back to school. I am your brother cum laude, Justin McElroy.

15
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:26,640
I am your class clown, Travis McElroy.

16
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:28,880
And I am the valedictorian.

17
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:36,160
You don't get my name. You get a fart sound.

18
00:01:36,160 --> 00:01:39,600
So today we're talking back to school, everything school related,

19
00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:46,080
comprehensive back to school guide for the youngsters out there, and the young at heart.

20
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:50,320
Just something to help you readjust to your class schedule.

21
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:53,840
And the people, maybe the people taking adult learning classes.

22
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:56,320
Maybe you're at the annex. You're at the annex.

23
00:01:56,320 --> 00:02:02,720
Griffin, how did you feel back as a youngster when school would come back in session?

24
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:07,680
I just had a conversation about this. I got really excited when it was back to school time.

25
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:08,880
You don't, me too.

26
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:10,960
I fucking love school supplies so much.

27
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:15,280
I get excited when I walk through the stationery aisle,

28
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:19,840
when come August, walk through the stationery aisle of the HEB, and I'm like,

29
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:21,760
oh, got to get some Lisa Franks.

30
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:25,360
I was straight up packing my backpack like three weeks prior to school.

31
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:26,560
I was the biggest nerd.

32
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:27,760
Yeah. Picking my outfits.

33
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:31,600
For me, it wasn't about the institution. I didn't care about like getting wiser.

34
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:34,160
I just cared about like,

35
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:34,960
see and be seen.

36
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:37,680
Yeah. What fashions are going to be in my classes.

37
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:42,560
And also what, whether kids were going to like my zip off khaki shorts.

38
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:46,160
And you know, it's funny that it stops like three days into school.

39
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:50,480
Like, yeah, got to get back. And then like, you're there for 15 minutes and you're like,

40
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:51,600
oh wait, this sucks.

41
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:55,600
Oh, it's the same shitty people in all my classes who all kind of don't like me

42
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:57,600
because of my fucking khaki zip offs.

43
00:02:57,600 --> 00:02:59,360
That's why there was always that excitement when like,

44
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:01,920
you're in the middle of fourth grade or something and there's a new kid.

45
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:04,320
And you're like, what the, this could be anything.

46
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:06,400
This isn't that dude I've known forever.

47
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:08,960
And he's just like a little different.

48
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:10,160
And then he's boring.

49
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:13,120
I did like it though when people would reinvent themselves over the summer.

50
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:13,360
Yeah.

51
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:16,160
You'd come back and they'd come back and they have a French accent.

52
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:17,200
Yeah. Whole new tip.

53
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:19,840
But let's, let's get to the questions.

54
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:23,360
Let's see if we can help you with their own back to school conundrums.

55
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:26,480
I will soon be a freshman in high school.

56
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:30,000
Almost all my siblings have gone to the school I'm about to attend.

57
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:35,440
And they've all taken the athletic route without any significant academic achievements.

58
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:38,640
On the contrary, I have chosen to be in marching band

59
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:43,440
and I'd rather read a good book or play video games than play a sport.

60
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:46,720
How can I deal with the complaints and negative comments from my family

61
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:49,680
and students who knew my family's legacy?

62
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:52,560
That's from lethargic in Illinois.

63
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:58,160
So when you say that no academic achievements, your siblings are just like soup stupid.

64
00:03:58,160 --> 00:03:59,520
Like really, really dumb.

65
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:03,760
I have a dumb family, but I am trying to reinvent myself.

66
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:06,320
Hey, listen, hey, you know what?

67
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:07,680
You're about to go into high school.

68
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:11,360
Well, let me help you out with some advice that makes him counterintuitive.

69
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:14,320
Just do some sports.

70
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:15,760
Girls love it.

71
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:18,480
You know, you gotta do some sports.

72
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:19,360
Gotta get fit.

73
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:21,840
Gotta look amazing.

74
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:23,760
You're gonna get super toned.

75
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:28,240
You're gonna, and listen, video games, good book, great books, whatever.

76
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:29,360
You can have someone read them to you.

77
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:32,400
You do that in the privacy of your own home in the dark where no one can see.

78
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:36,080
You'll probably have enough time to read when you're old and married.

79
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:42,000
There's not a video game alive that can help you blast your pecs and core and your arms.

80
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,640
You can't tone those arms while playing Mario Kart.

81
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:45,280
God knows.

82
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:48,480
Get sinewy, get fit, get muscly.

83
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:54,080
My primary advice to you would be cut it off before it's too late.

84
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:54,800
Stop reading.

85
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:55,840
Stop playing video games.

86
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:57,920
Get in the sport.

87
00:04:57,920 --> 00:05:02,000
Get strong and get dumb like the rest of your sports star family.

88
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:05,360
Just start headbutting your brothers.

89
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:06,480
Yeah, you've got it in you.

90
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:08,400
Why are you denying your gift?

91
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:10,400
The sports magic is in you.

92
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:11,440
I can hear you.

93
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:14,080
You are from a lineage of sports stars.

94
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:15,920
What about shit like track?

95
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:17,520
You don't even have to be big.

96
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:19,600
You could just run and jump like an MVP.

97
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:20,880
Come on.

98
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:22,480
Get fit.

99
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:25,680
Do you know why you don't like sports?

100
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:26,800
Because you're not fit.

101
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:27,440
Because you're not fit.

102
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:30,480
You're one of those like 90 pound weaklings and you need to send away

103
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:33,680
for that kit on the back of the boys life that's gonna make you big.

104
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:36,480
Hey, did you use whey and protein?

105
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:37,600
Do you use protein whey?

106
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:39,520
Slurp down some smoothies.

107
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:41,280
Justin, give him some smoothie tips.

108
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:44,880
Try some fruit in there.

109
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:49,280
Put some fruit in that smoothie, you goofster.

110
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:50,320
You're gonna get healthy.

111
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:55,440
You're gonna get so fit and look so good and feel good about yourself.

112
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:57,840
And your family will finally love you and accept you.

113
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:01,440
Like Sephiroth already accepts you.

114
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:04,880
That's how it's going.

115
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:08,160
Charles Dickens and Kurt Vonnegut think you're the pits.

116
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:08,720
Move on.

117
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:12,800
Now it's time to get that Peyton Manning seal of approval.

118
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:16,720
Get fit, get right, get dumb, and get ladies.

119
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:18,160
Step one, get dumb.

120
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:19,680
Step two, get big.

121
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:21,360
Step three, get ladies.

122
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:22,480
Get the ladies.

123
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:22,960
I want you to get so big.

124
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:24,160
Now listen, now listen.

125
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:26,880
This glory will be short-lived.

126
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:27,120
Yeah.

127
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:29,200
I can't.

128
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:30,880
This is really also important.

129
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:33,440
You are gonna really regret this.

130
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:37,920
Oh, then you get into college and it's like, oh, you're failing all your classes.

131
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:41,520
And we don't want you on the football team because they are much bigger than you are.

132
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:46,960
You got a pretty good grade in running, but you can't major in that anymore.

133
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:47,200
Yeah.

134
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:49,040
It's not 1930s.

135
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:53,120
And if all else fails, I guess you could compete in like debate.

136
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:54,960
That sounds competitive.

137
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:56,800
Your family could get behind, right?

138
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:57,440
Oh, that's-

139
00:06:57,440 --> 00:07:00,000
Boxing is a kind of debate, right?

140
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:01,680
Fist debate?

141
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:03,040
Like a gentleman's debate.

142
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:06,080
Yeah, do that Lincoln Douglas shit.

143
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:08,560
And you're like pounding the pulpit and screaming.

144
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:09,760
That stuff's awesome.

145
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:10,960
But he's gonna break his arm.

146
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:11,600
He's gonna break his-

147
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:13,200
Oh, yeah, because he's made of glass.

148
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:18,240
For baseball season, when it comes around.

149
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:24,080
Yeah, maybe get fit with one season and then with the other season, read.

150
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:24,800
Like don't do-

151
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:26,960
Oh, what if he was the biggest-

152
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:29,600
The folly, because I go with a two-sports schedule.

153
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:35,600
I like to keep my baseball in the summertime when it's summertime hot,

154
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:38,880
and then football in the fall-winter season.

155
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:40,080
Let me throw this out there, though.

156
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:44,160
What if he became the biggest, bulkiest, fittest debater?

157
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:45,360
Yeah.

158
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:50,400
And he was just a huge Hulk of a man standing behind the tiniest pulpit.

159
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:51,280
That would be cool.

160
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:54,400
I would say maybe get fit, but don't do sports, maybe.

161
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:55,840
Maybe your family will love you then.

162
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:56,880
It's hard to say.

163
00:07:56,880 --> 00:07:57,760
Don't be that fucking-

164
00:07:57,760 --> 00:07:58,720
No, fuck that.

165
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:03,440
Listen, I'm having a hard enough time out here as it is in the wastelands.

166
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:08,880
I don't need fucking good-looking dudes trying to take over

167
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:14,800
this very small corner of the earth that I've managed to fight off.

168
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:16,240
Carve out that little niche for yourself.

169
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:17,120
I carved out a little niche.

170
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:19,920
I don't need any sexy good bodies like, oh, me sports?

171
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:21,040
No, how droll.

172
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:21,540
I like-

173
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:23,840
I could be, of course.

174
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:26,480
Oh, yeah, but I'm in a band now, so.

175
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:28,000
I could be the greatest sports-

176
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:30,960
I pretty much just keep it the hacky sack.

177
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:32,080
Pretty much just hack.

178
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:34,880
Just light sacking during my lunch hours.

179
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:37,680
Hey, I'll be a sophomore in high school in a few days.

180
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:41,760
And while I got good grades my freshman year, I didn't do a whole lot of extracurriculars.

181
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:43,840
Like, seriously, I did jack shit.

182
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:47,200
What are some extracurriculars that you three would recommend?

183
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:50,720
Preferably something that would look good on a college application,

184
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:52,800
but all suggestions are welcome.

185
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:54,880
Austin, North Carolina.

186
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:55,360
Did you guys-

187
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:58,880
When you guys were growing up in high school,

188
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:02,000
did it seem like kids got into extracurricular activities

189
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,320
and you had no idea how that happened?

190
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:06,400
Like, how you even started doing that?

191
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:06,960
I had it-

192
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:08,800
Where did that train depart from?

193
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:11,520
Because I don't know how you got on board with these.

194
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:13,600
Like, people are running around doing things

195
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:16,000
and being in clubs that I had no way of knowing.

196
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Well, my problem was, like, this idea of looks good on a college application.

197
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,120
Like, that blew my mind.

198
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:22,560
We're like, why are you doing that?

199
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:24,240
So it looks good on college application.

200
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:26,240
I'd be like, they don't give two shits.

201
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:30,720
In my mind, chest team and skull and bones

202
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:34,720
are like the same sort of level of shadowiness.

203
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:37,440
Like, I had no idea how-

204
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:38,960
You just stand in the hallway and yell,

205
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:40,240
I want to be chest team!

206
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:42,400
And then someone comes and they grab you

207
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:43,680
and they pull you into a dark room

208
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:44,880
and they put a hood over your head

209
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:46,560
and then the next day you're on chest team.

210
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:48,880
And you go through a blood ritual to become a mathlete.

211
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:52,560
I guess you have to be able to read.

212
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:53,440
Step one.

213
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:54,880
Step one, be able to read.

214
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:57,840
I just knew how to get into the pictures for the yearbook.

215
00:09:57,840 --> 00:09:59,120
Like, I wasn't in the clubs,

216
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:01,600
but on picture day, every time every club was called,

217
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:03,040
I was like, oh, that's me!

218
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:04,720
I'm in there.

219
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:07,920
That's good to find clubs that look good,

220
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:09,280
but are not really real.

221
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:13,200
Like, we had one called, like, scroll and quill

222
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:14,800
or something like that when I was in high school,

223
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:16,480
just for people who did media classes.

224
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:17,200
It's like, I'm fine.

225
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:19,040
People who love parchment.

226
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:19,600
Yeah.

227
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:21,280
My favorite was getting in the picture

228
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:22,560
for, like, the Latin club

229
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:24,560
and the Latin teacher was looking at me going,

230
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:28,880
um, I don't remember you in any classes ever.

231
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:30,480
I don't believe you were extant.

232
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:34,480
You could do student council.

233
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:36,000
I don't even know what they do.

234
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:39,280
By extracurriculars,

235
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:43,120
do they mean school-sanctioned extracurricular activities

236
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:46,720
or can this just be, like, off-court activities

237
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:47,920
when you're not in school time?

238
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:48,640
So, like,

239
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:49,360
Ooh, I don't know.

240
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:50,320
Like, 4-H?

241
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:52,320
Yeah, like fucking boxcar racing.

242
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:54,880
Like, oh, I thought you were going even further.

243
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:57,440
Like, my extracurricular is, like, crime fighting.

244
00:10:58,080 --> 00:10:58,640
Yeah, sure.

245
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:01,520
I think you should, I think you should find,

246
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:02,800
make up an extracurricular activity

247
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:04,480
that is not school-sanctioned

248
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:05,440
because then it's like,

249
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:08,240
it shows you have stick-to-it-iveness

250
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:09,840
and you have innovation.

251
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:10,320
Clever.

252
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:11,440
Yes.

253
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:12,800
Clever, clever, clever.

254
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:13,520
Clever-itis.

255
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:14,800
Clever-itis.

256
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:17,680
Maybe you start a camp that cleans up trash

257
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:18,640
in the neighborhood.

258
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:19,440
Ooh.

259
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:20,240
That's good.

260
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:21,600
Have you considered LARPing?

261
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:22,960
Maybe LARPing.

262
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:23,520
Did you even,

263
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:26,720
did you even consider LARPing?

264
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:30,000
How does LARPing look good on a college,

265
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,960
unless you're going for a fine arts degree,

266
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:35,280
how does LARPing look good on a college application?

267
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:37,920
If they don't think it's cool,

268
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:39,200
they won't know what it is.

269
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:40,080
Ooh.

270
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:40,720
That's a good point.

271
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:41,520
You might confuse them.

272
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:42,480
Intimidated.

273
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:43,120
Ooh, boy.

274
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:45,840
If you don't know that LARP stands for live-action roleplay,

275
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:47,440
it kind of sounds like it could be like

276
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:48,960
a sophisticated activity.

277
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:50,320
Like it sounds like something,

278
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:51,840
it sounds like something you do with students.

279
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:53,920
It sounds like you're farting with your eyes.

280
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:54,720
Falcon butt.

281
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:56,560
No, if you said you were a LARPist.

282
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:57,440
Yeah.

283
00:11:58,080 --> 00:11:59,360
Well, don't say that.

284
00:11:59,360 --> 00:11:59,600
Oh.

285
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:01,600
He's a convicted LARPist.

286
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:06,960
He got convicted on three counts of LARP.

287
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:11,200
It was a fair trial and an impartial judge.

288
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:12,160
It was a pretty cool case.

289
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:14,800
There's no such thing as an impartial judge or jury

290
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:16,160
in a case involving LARP.

291
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:17,360
There just isn't.

292
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:18,480
Everybody has a bias.

293
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:19,920
That's true.

294
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:20,400
That's true.

295
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:24,160
Are you guys ready for your first back to school trivia point

296
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:26,160
from the movie Back to School with Rodney Dangerfield?

297
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:26,960
Fucking Jesus.

298
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:27,840
Yeah, sure.

299
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:29,760
In the original script,

300
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:32,320
Rodney Dangerfield's character was poor,

301
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:35,200
but Harold Ramis suggested that it be changed to make him rich.

302
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:39,840
Pretty much changing the entire movie to a different movie.

303
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:42,960
Pretty much the whole film got flipped on its ear that day,

304
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:44,560
that fateful day.

305
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:46,480
Listen, he's poor and he can't do shit

306
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:47,520
because he wants to go back to school,

307
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:48,080
but he can't.

308
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:48,800
That's the movie.

309
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:50,880
That's pretty interesting.

310
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:51,920
Let me throw this out.

311
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:54,560
He has unlimited resources and he's able to do whatever he wants.

312
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:55,600
Infinite money,

313
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:58,000
but he still kind of wants to get an education.

314
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,600
So just so I'm clear,

315
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:04,000
you want to make a movie about an adult man who is poor

316
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,360
because he didn't go to college?

317
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,280
Like, that's not a plot.

318
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:11,280
That's not a plot. That's my AutoZone.

319
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:16,560
Jesus.

320
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:17,600
No, those guys are great.

321
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:20,560
Let's do a Yahoo Answer question.

322
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:26,640
This one was sent in by Pandapocalypse.

323
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:28,400
Thanks, you.

324
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:34,480
It's by Yahoo Answers user I'mAllYours who asks,

325
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:39,280
what are the best places for sex in college?

326
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:43,440
Just curious because sometimes it's hard to find a good place.

327
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:45,120
I try to do it in my dorm sometimes,

328
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:46,880
but it's not easy because I would never want to do it

329
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:47,600
in front of my roommate.

330
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:49,360
That would look horrible on my part.

331
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:52,000
So please, what places did you have sex while you were in college?

332
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:52,400
Thanks.

333
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:56,160
There's only one place to do it.

334
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:57,120
Yeah, in your bed.

335
00:13:58,560 --> 00:13:59,520
Dean's couch.

336
00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:03,680
Sorry, Dean, asshole.

337
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:06,160
McElroy!

338
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:10,080
I just had some sex on your couch, Dean.

339
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:12,320
Hey, big man.

340
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:16,320
I just had sex on your couch, Dean, asshole.

341
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:18,080
Don't sit on the middle cushion anymore.

342
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:19,440
That one's mine.

343
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:23,120
Hey, I'm cleaning that with my own human musk, Dean.

344
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:27,360
Unhuman musk is the name of my college jam band.

345
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:31,280
See those wavy lines coming off it?

346
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:32,560
That's my sex steak.

347
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:36,640
I hate you, Dean.

348
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:38,400
I hate you so much, Dean.

349
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:40,160
Why wouldn't you let me into your college?

350
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:44,240
I'm not a student here.

351
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:49,440
This is a conundrum.

352
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:50,880
This is a real pickle.

353
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:55,360
You ask your roommate to hop into the common room

354
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:56,480
and play some GoldenEye for a while.

355
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:59,120
Well, sometimes fucking roommates suck dick,

356
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:00,640
and sometimes they'll just kick in the door

357
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:02,640
and be like, sup, fucking?

358
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:03,520
Like, yeah, I am.

359
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:06,400
You can clearly, clearly see that I'm doing that.

360
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:11,600
At my school, we had two libraries,

361
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:12,960
because one closed.

362
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:14,160
And one was for fucking.

363
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:18,000
So the closed one was pretty much just for fucking,

364
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,160
and old books that nobody read anymore.

365
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:21,680
That's the haunted one, though, right?

366
00:15:22,640 --> 00:15:23,600
The stacks?

367
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:24,320
The stacks, yeah.

368
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:26,800
Every college has a stacks I've learned.

369
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:27,120
Really?

370
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:28,560
And that's a good place to do it

371
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:31,760
if you're not worried about spectral observers.

372
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:36,960
There's one place they love, is old book stacks.

373
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:38,960
Why every episode, it's just either

374
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:40,320
we're talking about killing horses

375
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:41,920
or we're talking about horny ghosts.

376
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:42,420
Yep.

377
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:45,200
Now, someday we're going to combine those two,

378
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:47,040
and we're going to have a sixth.

379
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:49,760
It's going to be a TV series that lasts for six seasons.

380
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:52,480
It's going to start Mandy Patinkin as the voice.

381
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:55,040
As the horny ghost horse whisperer.

382
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:56,400
Horny ghost whisperer.

383
00:15:56,400 --> 00:15:57,680
The horny ghost horse whisperer.

384
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:03,600
First of all, true love waits, so don't do it.

385
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:05,440
Because the last thing you need in college

386
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,640
is like AIDS and stuff.

387
00:16:08,640 --> 00:16:12,800
But I think that your parents' house,

388
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:14,720
when you're babysitting,

389
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:15,680
when you're house sitting it.

390
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:19,040
Okay, that's a pretty specific situation.

391
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:21,920
When you're, can you go to a hotel?

392
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:25,520
Do you have those kinds of fungible assets required?

393
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:27,200
They're in college.

394
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:27,520
Yeah.

395
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:31,520
Yeah, but you can find like a motel eight for like 35 bucks.

396
00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:34,320
And is it worth 35 bucks for you to get your dick wet?

397
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:36,880
They're not in high school, they're in college.

398
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:38,720
This person's on Yahoo Answers,

399
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:40,480
they're not a fucking idiot.

400
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:43,200
Like, I need to have sex, what am hotel?

401
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:44,640
Like, they know hotels.

402
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:46,320
If they want to have sex at a hotel, they just know.

403
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:47,920
Listen, but they asked for suggestions.

404
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:51,360
But if they're dating this person and burning on the reg,

405
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:53,600
they're not going to pay $35 a night.

406
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:55,680
Be like, are we getting lucky tonight?

407
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:56,960
Should I make a reservation?

408
00:16:56,960 --> 00:16:57,760
You know what, you guys?

409
00:16:57,760 --> 00:17:00,000
I'm hearing a lot of talk and not a lot of answers

410
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:00,880
from the two of you.

411
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:03,920
I say get over this hangover

412
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:05,920
by not wanting to do it in front of your roommate.

413
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:07,840
I can deal with it.

414
00:17:07,840 --> 00:17:09,760
Yeah, give him a show until he leaves.

415
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:11,040
Call his bluff.

416
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:13,040
Do you guys know how many people are on the Earth right now?

417
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:14,880
Seven billion.

418
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:19,040
Where on the Earth can you fuck that nobody can see you?

419
00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:20,960
Oh, everyone can see you all the time.

420
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:22,480
Everyone is looking at you.

421
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:23,360
Yeah, think about that.

422
00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:26,880
At any given point, there's some satellite taking a picture of you

423
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:29,520
for Yahoo Maps or Google Maps fucking.

424
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:31,440
Oh, Yahoo Maps?

425
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:32,480
Yeah, I made that up.

426
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:34,240
Have you guys been to Yahoo Maps?

427
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:37,440
It's like Google Maps, except everybody is sort of a crowdsource engine

428
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:39,440
that people can just give you directions to shit.

429
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:42,160
I need to get to Dairy Queen.

430
00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:44,880
By the way, don't have a one-night stand

431
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:46,080
with somebody you're in a class with.

432
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:51,600
That's a real good way to turn math 101 into avoiding eye contact.

433
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:52,320
104.

434
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:54,800
Don't have one-night stands at all.

435
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:55,600
Yeah, don't do that.

436
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:58,480
I think it's a mistake.

437
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:00,800
If you want to turn college into something shady and boring.

438
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:06,960
Do you want to turn college into just a series of pregnancy scares

439
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:09,040
and STD tests?

440
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:11,280
Yeah, what?

441
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:13,600
Listen, a ship in a harbor is safe.

442
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:16,240
A dick in a vagina is not.

443
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:17,440
No, it's not.

444
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:18,960
Don't say those two words, Travis.

445
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:19,680
Don't, Travis.

446
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:20,880
Don't say that word.

447
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:23,280
It's okay when Griffin says it, but when you say it,

448
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:24,960
you make something dirty and terrible.

449
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:27,120
A dick in a vagina.

450
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:29,520
You say it more wrong.

451
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:30,560
You say it wrong like that.

452
00:18:30,560 --> 00:18:34,800
You say it like a British dock hand in the mid-1800s.

453
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:35,760
It's horrifying.

454
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:36,640
Like a vagina.

455
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:38,320
A hoi dick.

456
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:41,520
You stress the I in a way that is unpleasant to me.

457
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:43,120
So how am I supposed to say it?

458
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:43,680
Vagina.

459
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:44,960
Vagina.

460
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:47,280
Travis, god damn.

461
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:50,160
Hey, can we...

462
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:51,600
Can you...

463
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:53,760
And this is just...

464
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:56,000
I'm still coming up with ideas where you can have sex

465
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,360
because we didn't give this person anything.

466
00:18:57,360 --> 00:19:01,120
I think that can you rent some scuba gear

467
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:02,400
and then like go in a river?

468
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:05,360
I don't think you need scuba gear for a river.

469
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:08,000
So you know, but you would need to get under the water

470
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,960
because then nobody could see you under the waves.

471
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:12,720
It wouldn't have to be a river.

472
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:13,680
Do you know what I'm saying?

473
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:16,240
They have scuba classes at college.

474
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:18,880
Both of you take a scuba class,

475
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:20,480
go down to the bottom of the pool,

476
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:21,680
get that wetsuit off,

477
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:23,440
take some sort of...

478
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:27,760
You will need some something down there.

479
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:29,600
I think you know what I mean.

480
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:30,400
Like a harpoon?

481
00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:31,840
No, like a...

482
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:36,080
It's not gonna be pleasurable.

483
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:36,800
Oh, okay.

484
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:38,800
This is utilitarian fucking.

485
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:41,040
Like you're gonna need something.

486
00:19:41,040 --> 00:19:43,040
You make me so angry sometimes

487
00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:45,040
because now all I'm gonna be thinking about

488
00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:46,640
for the rest of the show is whaler sex.

489
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:50,400
Thar she blows.

490
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:50,720
Yeah.

491
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:51,120
Does she?

492
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:52,880
I heard she did.

493
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:54,400
I'm gonna ask her out this weekend.

494
00:19:55,920 --> 00:19:58,240
So I hope that that helps you.

495
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:00,320
I hope it doesn't.

496
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:02,400
It's really rough out there.

497
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:04,800
It's hard to find any place to have sex.

498
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:06,720
That's why people are buying houses so rapidly.

499
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:08,800
It's the only place you can do it anymore.

500
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:14,000
Can you get a timeshare with your friends,

501
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:14,960
your collegiate friends,

502
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:15,520
and you can be like,

503
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:16,400
where are you going?

504
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:17,840
I'm going to the lake house.

505
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:18,560
That is honestly,

506
00:20:18,560 --> 00:20:22,480
I think that is the reason why people are required

507
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:24,080
to live in the dorms the first year,

508
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:24,880
like their freshman year.

509
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:25,200
And be like,

510
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:27,360
hey, let's make it really hard for them

511
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:29,680
so we make sure they all get apartments

512
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:30,720
their sophomore year.

513
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:32,080
And then they bow down.

514
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:34,160
It does make it really hard for them though,

515
00:20:34,160 --> 00:20:35,920
because you're throwing a bunch of people

516
00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:38,560
who have never lived with another person before

517
00:20:38,560 --> 00:20:43,200
into a big sexy miasma of sweet,

518
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:45,360
sweet opposite sex to people.

519
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:48,000
Like how am I supposed?

520
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,720
I don't possess the tools required to handle that.

521
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:52,080
I'm a grown ass man now.

522
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:53,280
And if you asked me to do that,

523
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:54,480
I don't think I could.

524
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:56,000
I think I would just like run through the hallway

525
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,560
screaming like so many choices,

526
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:00,720
partners everywhere,

527
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:03,120
potential sexual partners.

528
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:03,620
Yeah.

529
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:05,600
Hey Griff,

530
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:06,560
if you're still single in a year,

531
00:21:06,560 --> 00:21:07,760
that might be a possibility.

532
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:10,080
Maybe a back to school situation.

533
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:12,000
Yeah, that'd be a pretty sad reason to go back to school.

534
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:16,720
I will be teaching a couple of intro level college art classes

535
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:19,200
beginning the day this episode goes online.

536
00:21:20,560 --> 00:21:22,640
Aside from telling me what to teach,

537
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:24,560
because I'm pretty much going to be winging it

538
00:21:24,560 --> 00:21:25,920
for the next 16 weeks,

539
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:27,040
do you have any advice for me

540
00:21:27,040 --> 00:21:29,280
as far as how to present myself to the class?

541
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:30,320
More importantly,

542
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:32,880
how can I drop some impressive knowledge on these kids,

543
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:34,240
i.e. keep my job,

544
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:35,680
while also portraying myself

545
00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:38,640
as unpredictably volatile caricature of a teacher,

546
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:39,600
entertaining myself,

547
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:42,080
winging it in Ohio.

548
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:46,640
Does he mean like a fucking Mr. Holland?

549
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:50,640
Is he talking about like being a teacher from a movie?

550
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:52,480
Is that what he means by a volatile caricature of a teacher?

551
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:54,800
Yeah, I believe he's talking about something like

552
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,560
a character you might see on the show Community.

553
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:00,960
Where they're a little wacky and crazy.

554
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:04,880
I see volatile and I think straight up,

555
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:06,160
trunchable.

556
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:06,960
Oh, yeah.

557
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:08,400
I get to make them eat the cake.

558
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:11,840
Yeah, like, yeah, like throwing the Chokey.

559
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:13,040
This is what I'm talking about.

560
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:16,400
I think that if you throw somebody in the Chokey,

561
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:18,400
the day one,

562
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:20,000
and you make him eat the cake day two,

563
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:22,320
for the rest of the semester,

564
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:23,760
you can pretty much do what you want.

565
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:25,200
They're not going to shake those images.

566
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:27,280
You can just skip work a bunch of days.

567
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:28,000
They're not going to tell.

568
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,160
They're just sit there in the classroom quietly.

569
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:32,560
By the way, still looking for a place to have sex?

570
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:33,280
Chokey.

571
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:34,080
The Chokey.

572
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:35,440
It's a little pointy in there.

573
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:39,840
It won't be the best doing it situation you've ever had,

574
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:41,600
but you'll get the job done.

575
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:42,660
Yeah.

576
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:44,640
Just keep Matilda out of there.

577
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:47,760
I think he definitely needs to wear a tweed jacket,

578
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:50,480
but maybe a loose tie so they know you're there for fun.

579
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:54,720
Sunglasses and Bermuda shorts.

580
00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:57,040
Like in summer school.

581
00:22:57,040 --> 00:22:59,120
Griffin, did you say you might be a little bi?

582
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:01,440
A little high, but that maybe also.

583
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:04,800
By the way, what?

584
00:23:06,560 --> 00:23:09,120
Did you guys ever have like a really cool college teacher?

585
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:11,680
Yeah, yeah.

586
00:23:11,680 --> 00:23:12,240
Sure.

587
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:12,480
Who?

588
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:13,280
Sure.

589
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:15,520
This is a discussion thing, and you tell me about that.

590
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:16,080
Why would you?

591
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:16,640
Like, do you want?

592
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:18,080
Do you want to know?

593
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:19,120
We went to different colleges.

594
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:20,160
Like, do you want names?

595
00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:21,120
Do you want office numbers?

596
00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:23,040
Tell me, what made him cool?

597
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,040
Okay, I will tell you this.

598
00:23:25,040 --> 00:23:26,800
Most of the teachers that I had growing up,

599
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:30,240
I, you can tell the teachers that don't know their shit.

600
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:34,320
The ones to me that I always ended up liking and respected

601
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:38,720
had never, like, never let you forget that they knew, like,

602
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:41,200
infinitely more about the subject than you did.

603
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:45,040
So I think if you keep that dangling over their heads at all times,

604
00:23:45,040 --> 00:23:47,520
maybe ask them questions that they'd have no way of knowing

605
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:49,360
and then answering like they're a dumbass.

606
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:50,800
What is art?

607
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:52,320
Wrong.

608
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:53,680
Drop that shit on them one day.

609
00:23:53,680 --> 00:23:54,400
Incorrect.

610
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:56,960
Incorrect. I had one teacher and he taught

611
00:23:57,680 --> 00:24:00,080
one of the political history classes I took,

612
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:03,520
and he had assigned, like, all these books,

613
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:07,200
like, 12 books for reading throughout the course of the semester.

614
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:10,480
And one day in class, it was this huge, like, 75-person class.

615
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:12,640
He goes, did anybody do the reading for today?

616
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:17,360
And nobody raised their hands, and he flipped shit.

617
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:21,840
Like, just started screaming nonsense and, like, pounding his desk

618
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:24,720
and just got up and walked out without any explanation.

619
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:26,080
Whose fault is that, Travis?

620
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:28,800
Well, and then the TA just looked at everyone and went,

621
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:31,840
um, well, I guess that's class for today.

622
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:35,680
And after that, I fucking did the reading every single time.

623
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:37,040
Yeah, that's how you got to do it.

624
00:24:37,040 --> 00:24:37,840
That's what I'm saying.

625
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:39,120
That's what teaching is.

626
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:41,760
Chokey day one, eat the cake day two,

627
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:43,040
and then no one gets out of line.

628
00:24:43,040 --> 00:24:44,080
And then you can be cool.

629
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:45,200
They'll just know.

630
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:46,640
They have to know your loco.

631
00:24:47,280 --> 00:24:47,920
That's a problem.

632
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:48,400
That's the thing.

633
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:49,680
You're never going to be their friend.

634
00:24:49,680 --> 00:24:52,960
Guys, I hate this, this discussion that we're in.

635
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:56,160
I don't think I, you got to inspire these kids.

636
00:24:56,160 --> 00:24:58,960
You got to, you got to, you got to put the art in them.

637
00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:01,200
Can you put the art in them?

638
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:03,840
I want you to, like, day one, like, when they come in,

639
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:05,120
just have a little lump of clay.

640
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:06,640
Sing at all their desks.

641
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:09,200
And that's good because you can be like, create.

642
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:11,440
And then they'll start making art.

643
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:13,280
And then give them butterfly kisses.

644
00:25:13,280 --> 00:25:16,000
And then when they're done with their art, making art,

645
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,880
you go around and you tell all of them how, what a good job they did.

646
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:22,640
And you go to the front of class and you say, you know, I had to do this.

647
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:25,040
And then you'd be like, because you guys are clay.

648
00:25:25,040 --> 00:25:28,240
I'm going to shape you into better people, better artists.

649
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:30,000
And you just walk out of the room.

650
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:31,840
Griffin, can I amend that just real quick?

651
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:34,320
Except for one student.

652
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:36,720
Just the one guy.

653
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:40,160
One student just walk over and throw their fist onto their thing.

654
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:40,880
Yeah.

655
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:42,720
What is this shitty bullshit?

656
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:44,720
This is vulgar.

657
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:46,320
Get it out.

658
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:48,400
This offends my senses.

659
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:48,720
Or.

660
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:50,240
I will remove one of you each day.

661
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:50,800
What if.

662
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:52,720
Survivor class.

663
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:58,000
What if you flip it and you tell everyone that they did an okay job.

664
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:01,360
But then one kid who also did an okay job.

665
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:04,000
You just fucking lift him up to the heavens.

666
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:04,480
Yeah.

667
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:07,600
And then tell them at the end of the semester, like, just so you know,

668
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:09,440
I was bullshitting you this whole time.

669
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:12,080
Everyone, look at what Bradley made.

670
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:15,120
It could be like Jamie Foxx in that cello movie.

671
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:15,360
Yeah.

672
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:16,320
With Iron Man in it.

673
00:26:17,280 --> 00:26:17,680
Yeah.

674
00:26:17,680 --> 00:26:19,040
That movie sounds awesome.

675
00:26:19,040 --> 00:26:19,520
Yeah.

676
00:26:20,560 --> 00:26:21,680
Pretty good flick.

677
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:25,120
Are you guys ready for another back to school trivia bit?

678
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:25,680
No.

679
00:26:25,680 --> 00:26:26,160
Okay, great.

680
00:26:26,160 --> 00:26:26,960
Here it is.

681
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:30,880
One of the last shots in the opening montage is of Rodney Dangerfield golfing.

682
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:34,320
This was taken directly from his first film, Caddyshack.

683
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:36,400
I didn't know you could do that.

684
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:38,160
I didn't know you could just borrow scenes.

685
00:26:38,160 --> 00:26:39,840
I didn't know you could just borrow scenes.

686
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:43,680
Yeah, I didn't know you could be like, hey, we're about three seconds short on this montage.

687
00:26:43,680 --> 00:26:45,840
Has he been in any golfing movies?

688
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:46,320
Lift it.

689
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:47,120
Is that cool?

690
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:52,080
We need just a quick three second clip.

691
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:54,160
We're doing post-pro right now.

692
00:26:54,160 --> 00:26:58,880
We need a three second clip of Rodney as a cartoon dog.

693
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:02,400
Can we just borrow that from you?

694
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:06,560
You know, this Jamie Foxx, Robert Downey Jr. vehicle is pretty good.

695
00:27:06,560 --> 00:27:08,400
Do you have any clips of Rodney?

696
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:13,840
Do you have any clips of Robert like shooting blasts out of his hands or flying around with

697
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:15,520
rockets coming out of his feet or anything?

698
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:21,200
He's teaching him how to achieve his cello dream, but we also need him in a sweet robot

699
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:24,800
suit just for like a three second behind the back over the shoulder.

700
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:29,040
If he could be talking to Gwyneth Paltrow like that, even better.

701
00:27:29,040 --> 00:27:33,040
It's common when actors, they do actually have to do that a lot when actors die during

702
00:27:33,040 --> 00:27:34,720
filming because they have to lift.

703
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:40,640
Like, have you guys ever wondered, hold on, hold on, I can do this.

704
00:27:41,920 --> 00:27:46,400
Have you guys ever wondered why there's that one scene in Dark Knight when the Joker kisses

705
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:47,600
cowboy Jake Gyllenhaal?

706
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:49,120
That's why.

707
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:50,320
I always wondered that.

708
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:53,360
And then he was jousting for a bit, which I always thought was weird.

709
00:27:54,560 --> 00:27:54,800
Yeah.

710
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:57,520
Oh, I miss him so much.

711
00:27:57,520 --> 00:27:58,720
I miss him every day.

712
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:02,000
I was just thinking about what a better movie.

713
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:03,440
I should call Michelle Phillips.

714
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:07,920
That cello man movie would have been so much better if he'd been like, and now you're

715
00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:09,760
a cellist and you achieved your dream.

716
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:10,260
Woosh!

717
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:15,280
General's got it in their mouth, sir!

718
00:28:15,280 --> 00:28:17,280
Like, that would be so awesome.

719
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:21,920
And then he solves the mystery with a few clues because he's also Sherlock Holmes.

720
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:27,120
Hey, I'm entering my final read, fifth year of college.

721
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:27,680
Hey, listen.

722
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:30,480
Hey, listen, I did it too, buddy.

723
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:31,520
Don't feel bad.

724
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:35,440
I've had an amazing four years and I want to make this year the best.

725
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:37,600
It's a victory lap, I wouldn't it be?

726
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:37,920
Yeah.

727
00:28:37,920 --> 00:28:40,800
Hey, any fun ideas that you guys did in your final year?

728
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:43,600
Or have you heard of any new college crazy happenings?

729
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:46,560
I'm sick of beer pong and the same theme party ideas.

730
00:28:46,560 --> 00:28:49,760
What is it something that will push this year over the top?

731
00:28:51,280 --> 00:28:52,000
Graduating.

732
00:28:52,800 --> 00:28:53,440
Graduating.

733
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:57,920
That'll really take this year over the edge.

734
00:28:57,920 --> 00:28:58,560
Finish.

735
00:28:58,560 --> 00:29:01,680
I heard that college kids nowadays, what they're doing in their final year

736
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:06,400
is that they are just spending it in quiet contemplation.

737
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:11,680
Thinking about their future careers and maybe some goals and dreams they may have.

738
00:29:11,680 --> 00:29:12,880
Got a long road ahead of you.

739
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:14,240
Got a long road behind you.

740
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:15,280
You've already done so much.

741
00:29:15,280 --> 00:29:17,920
Why don't you just consider the leaves?

742
00:29:17,920 --> 00:29:19,120
You're sick of beer pong.

743
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:22,240
Maybe it's time to get sick of studying for final exams.

744
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:24,240
Maybe something like that.

745
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:31,440
I attended, we would throw an annual beach party in someone's apartment

746
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:34,640
where we would fill it with sand and then have a kiddie pool

747
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:36,800
and then everybody wore beach wear.

748
00:29:36,800 --> 00:29:37,760
That was fun.

749
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:40,960
Justin, this sounds fucking, that sounds like a fucking ordeal.

750
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:42,240
How did you get the sand out?

751
00:29:42,800 --> 00:29:43,920
What vacuums?

752
00:29:43,920 --> 00:29:50,000
And it was, he decided that he was going to lose his security deposit real early on.

753
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:51,280
Early in his tenure.

754
00:29:51,280 --> 00:29:55,200
Wait, was this the same apartment that you used to play that game

755
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:58,560
where everybody would go in the bathroom and you'd cut open a bunch of fireworks

756
00:29:58,560 --> 00:30:01,120
and dump them in the sink and then light it

757
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:03,520
and then see who could stay in the room the longest?

758
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:04,560
Yeah, we did that game.

759
00:30:04,560 --> 00:30:06,080
Man, you were fucking dumb.

760
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:07,600
Man, you were really dumb.

761
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:12,080
We did the game where we would put our initials in lighter fluid on the carpet

762
00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:12,720
and then light it.

763
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:14,880
It's not a game, not a game.

764
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:16,960
Well, you can certainly lose it.

765
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:17,440
That's fair.

766
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:21,360
Yeah, you know what I did in my senior year is I arranged all my classes

767
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:23,600
so that I had nothing on Fridays.

768
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:26,320
So I had three-day weekends every week.

769
00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:27,040
That's nice.

770
00:30:27,040 --> 00:30:28,480
Yeah, it was pretty sweet.

771
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:32,080
And then that meant Friday was an all-day drinking day.

772
00:30:33,040 --> 00:30:34,320
Batman Friday.

773
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:38,640
Yeah, you got, you got, let's see, Bloody Marys in the morning,

774
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:42,560
mimosas at noon, and then beer at five.

775
00:30:42,560 --> 00:30:43,680
I love a mimosa.

776
00:30:43,680 --> 00:30:45,520
That's how you're gonna, that's how you're gonna put, yeah.

777
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:46,880
Man, I could go for a fucking mimosa.

778
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:47,440
I know, right?

779
00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:50,720
That is how you're gonna push this year over the top,

780
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:53,120
is if you find your physical limits.

781
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:53,620
Yeah.

782
00:30:54,560 --> 00:30:55,360
Oh, wow.

783
00:30:55,360 --> 00:30:58,160
Yeah, like pushers, you need to know what you're capable of

784
00:30:58,160 --> 00:30:59,680
before you get into the real world.

785
00:30:59,680 --> 00:31:00,080
Yeah.

786
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:03,520
Now, do you mean things like, you know, mental effort?

787
00:31:03,520 --> 00:31:04,880
Like you push yourself in-

788
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:06,080
No, I meant drinking.

789
00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:06,640
Oh, okay.

790
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:08,480
I was also gonna say eating challenges.

791
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:12,480
Hey, life is just one big eating challenge if you think about it.

792
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:13,040
Mm-hmm.

793
00:31:13,040 --> 00:31:13,840
Can I make a note?

794
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:16,320
Uh, after I said that about the sand,

795
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:19,600
I can't remember if that's something we talked about doing or actually did.

796
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:22,080
Justin, the logistics of that is really rough.

797
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:25,200
If you went to college with me and we did that, that was cool.

798
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:27,120
If I didn't do that, just keep it to yourself, okay?

799
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:29,840
You have so many things that you did that were wonderful

800
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:32,960
with that group, with that crew you used to roll.

801
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:33,840
I feel like we could do-

802
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:37,280
Like that time that Travis gave Brandon McCoy a concussion.

803
00:31:37,280 --> 00:31:38,960
Which I still feel bad about.

804
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:40,880
You should, we were playing a game.

805
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:43,040
This is another, this is another game.

806
00:31:43,040 --> 00:31:45,600
And in this game, one person would wear a motorcycle helmet.

807
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:47,120
But technically it was a scooter helmet.

808
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:47,840
Uh-huh.

809
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:49,920
Because he bought it to ride in his scooter.

810
00:31:49,920 --> 00:31:52,400
And we would put the helmet on and then the,

811
00:31:52,400 --> 00:31:56,320
and then another party would hit that person in the head with a bowling pin.

812
00:31:56,320 --> 00:31:56,800
Uh-huh.

813
00:31:56,800 --> 00:31:57,200
The basher.

814
00:31:57,200 --> 00:31:58,080
Now hold on.

815
00:31:58,080 --> 00:31:58,800
Yeah.

816
00:31:58,800 --> 00:31:59,280
What?

817
00:31:59,280 --> 00:31:59,440
Yeah.

818
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:00,640
The basher was the name of that position.

819
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:01,440
The basher.

820
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:02,080
Yeah.

821
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:04,800
So the basher would hit that person and then they would switch.

822
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:08,080
So like you didn't want to hit them too hard because they were gonna hit you.

823
00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:09,520
So Travis was hanging out.

824
00:32:09,520 --> 00:32:11,680
It was his first time as a young man, probably still in high school.

825
00:32:11,680 --> 00:32:17,440
And we said, hey, why don't you take a swing with Brandon, who's a sweet kid we all hung out with.

826
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:19,760
He's even sweeter now.

827
00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:25,760
He's even sweeter now because Travis did like a kind of whirlwind, over the shoulder windmill.

828
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:26,800
A haymaker, I believe.

829
00:32:26,800 --> 00:32:28,400
A haymaker, if you will.

830
00:32:28,400 --> 00:32:30,000
And just drilled him.

831
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,080
Dropped him like a sack of stupid bricks.

832
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:37,200
Now to be fair, this was a time in my life where I was just like coming into my own physically

833
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:39,120
and I had no grasp of my own strength.

834
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:43,440
Don't try to play it off like it's your first day under the yellow sun and you're just like,

835
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:46,480
oh shit, my powers are awakened.

836
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:47,680
Like you just drilled him.

837
00:32:47,680 --> 00:32:48,400
I brained him.

838
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:49,680
I brained him real good.

839
00:32:49,680 --> 00:32:51,840
You had like half of Mike's heart eliminated.

840
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:56,560
Oh God, I can feel Mike coursing through my veins.

841
00:32:57,760 --> 00:32:58,160
Help me.

842
00:32:58,800 --> 00:32:59,760
So he got a concussion.

843
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:00,480
It's no big deal.

844
00:33:01,040 --> 00:33:02,160
He's fine now.

845
00:33:02,160 --> 00:33:03,120
He's fine now, I guess.

846
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:04,560
I don't know, I haven't heard from him in a while.

847
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:07,200
Since that night actually, he just kind of wandered off.

848
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:12,240
I like the story where you took Jason's iguana and you went out and you bought a lobster and

849
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:15,600
you had the lobster and the iguana fight and said you would eat the loser.

850
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:16,960
Yeah, that's true.

851
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:17,680
That's true, too.

852
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:19,680
Yeah, this is college.

853
00:33:19,680 --> 00:33:20,480
This is what you should.

854
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:21,600
That's another thing you gotta do.

855
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:26,000
You gotta find a dumb, dumb group of friends and just do as much dumb shit as you possibly

856
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,080
can so you can tell stories about it later.

857
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:29,520
Yes, that's exactly it.

858
00:33:29,520 --> 00:33:30,000
You know what?

859
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,960
I want to tell a story about how I need some money.

860
00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:35,600
Man, my fungibles are low.

861
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:36,560
Low.

862
00:33:36,560 --> 00:33:36,800
Yeah.

863
00:33:36,800 --> 00:33:37,760
That's how my fun ends.

864
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:40,960
Travis, will you take us to the money then?

865
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:51,520
Yes.

866
00:33:55,440 --> 00:33:58,320
Listeners Sam and Gaby would like to wish their friend Nick...

867
00:33:58,320 --> 00:33:59,200
Ah, damn it.

868
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:00,720
Pronunciation, people.

869
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:01,440
What do you guys think?

870
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:02,880
CRL?

871
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:03,440
CRL!

872
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:06,880
Nick CRL a very happy birthday.

873
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:08,480
His birthday is August 28th.

874
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:14,880
He loves pug dogs and they want to wish him happy birthday and they miss him so much.

875
00:34:16,400 --> 00:34:17,600
Well, they're going to miss him.

876
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:18,480
They're going to miss him.

877
00:34:19,040 --> 00:34:23,440
He hasn't left yet, but presumably he's not there with them while they're reading this

878
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:24,720
so maybe they miss him right this second.

879
00:34:24,720 --> 00:34:27,280
Also, hey, listen.

880
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:33,360
This is going out from Liz and we need to talk to our buddy Emil.

881
00:34:33,360 --> 00:34:38,320
He's a fan, which is good, but pretty much we're the only thing in his life that's working

882
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:39,040
out right now.

883
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:40,800
Shit is rough for Emil.

884
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:45,600
Yeah, he got his house broken into, got a hard drive stolen, and like all his recordings

885
00:34:45,600 --> 00:34:47,120
and musics were on there.

886
00:34:47,120 --> 00:34:48,080
Ah, damn it.

887
00:34:48,080 --> 00:34:48,320
Yeah.

888
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:49,120
I know.

889
00:34:49,120 --> 00:34:50,800
He went through a bad breakup.

890
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:52,880
Because he found out his girlfriend broke into his house.

891
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:54,240
Yeah, hey.

892
00:34:54,240 --> 00:34:54,960
Hey, lady.

893
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:57,040
That's out of bounds.

894
00:34:57,040 --> 00:35:01,200
The receipt for this message got cut off.

895
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:08,640
So what it says here is the dude is S.A., which presumably he's sad, but we want to

896
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:09,360
turn it around.

897
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:11,760
The dude isn't sad.

898
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:13,600
The dude was sad yesterday.

899
00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:17,040
Today, we and the dude are turning it around.

900
00:35:17,840 --> 00:35:21,680
The dude is savage.

901
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:22,900
What?

902
00:35:22,900 --> 00:35:25,380
Turn it around, Emil.

903
00:35:25,380 --> 00:35:26,820
You're savage.

904
00:35:26,820 --> 00:35:31,060
There was a roll of thunder coming from somebody's microphones when you said that.

905
00:35:31,060 --> 00:35:31,940
Yeah, it was from mine.

906
00:35:31,940 --> 00:35:32,660
Wasn't it amazing?

907
00:35:32,660 --> 00:35:34,100
It was fucking powerful, man.

908
00:35:34,100 --> 00:35:34,600
Yeah.

909
00:35:34,600 --> 00:35:35,940
I hope that picks up.

910
00:35:35,940 --> 00:35:37,860
Can the dude also be savory?

911
00:35:37,860 --> 00:35:38,180
Yes.

912
00:35:38,180 --> 00:35:39,220
The dude is savory.

913
00:35:39,780 --> 00:35:42,340
This dude is real good.

914
00:35:42,340 --> 00:35:44,180
But he's not sated.

915
00:35:44,180 --> 00:35:45,780
He's not going to turn it around.

916
00:35:45,780 --> 00:35:47,780
He's not satisfied, all right?

917
00:35:47,780 --> 00:35:49,140
He's not sad anymore.

918
00:35:49,780 --> 00:35:51,060
He's not sappy.

919
00:35:51,060 --> 00:35:51,780
He's savage.

920
00:35:51,780 --> 00:35:53,300
Oh my god, the dude is a sasquatch.

921
00:35:55,300 --> 00:35:56,420
Sasquatch.

922
00:35:56,420 --> 00:35:59,140
Can we get sasquatch going as an adjective for something that's working out?

923
00:36:00,340 --> 00:36:01,380
That dude is squatch.

924
00:36:02,020 --> 00:36:03,540
He's so squatch.

925
00:36:03,540 --> 00:36:04,660
He's so squatch right now.

926
00:36:04,660 --> 00:36:05,460
So squatch.

927
00:36:05,460 --> 00:36:09,380
Did you see he just went and went to the big debate and he squatched it?

928
00:36:09,380 --> 00:36:10,580
He squatched the whole thing.

929
00:36:10,580 --> 00:36:11,460
He's so massive.

930
00:36:12,100 --> 00:36:14,580
To Nick, happy birthday.

931
00:36:14,580 --> 00:36:16,580
To Emil, stay savage.

932
00:36:16,580 --> 00:36:17,300
Get savage.

933
00:36:18,900 --> 00:36:20,100
Randy Savage.

934
00:36:20,100 --> 00:36:20,660
Turn it around.

935
00:36:20,660 --> 00:36:22,820
I miss you, Randy Savage.

936
00:36:22,820 --> 00:36:24,660
You know, I also miss Yahoo Answers.

937
00:36:24,660 --> 00:36:26,260
Here's one I found.

938
00:36:26,260 --> 00:36:28,820
It's by Yahoo Answers user Quester, who asks,

939
00:36:30,020 --> 00:36:34,020
when grind dancing and a boy gets a boner, are you supposed to continue?

940
00:36:35,300 --> 00:36:37,140
This is sort of back to school themed, right?

941
00:36:37,140 --> 00:36:37,540
Like you-

942
00:36:38,420 --> 00:36:39,860
Oh, if it's like a homecoming dance.

943
00:36:39,860 --> 00:36:40,420
Yeah, yeah.

944
00:36:40,420 --> 00:36:41,940
This is really the only time that you're-

945
00:36:43,140 --> 00:36:45,620
If you've ever been to a club or party or a high school dance

946
00:36:47,220 --> 00:36:50,340
and seen people dancing with their pelvises together,

947
00:36:50,340 --> 00:36:52,180
then you've just witnessed grinding.

948
00:36:53,780 --> 00:36:54,660
Deal with it.

949
00:36:55,300 --> 00:36:59,540
Sometimes you or someone you know has already been grounded.

950
00:37:02,660 --> 00:37:03,780
Someone got thrown-

951
00:37:03,780 --> 00:37:05,780
Do you know where your pelvis is at?

952
00:37:05,780 --> 00:37:10,420
I threw you into the pestle and the mortar and I done ground you.

953
00:37:10,420 --> 00:37:16,340
Sometimes referred to as freaking or freak dancing or winding.

954
00:37:16,340 --> 00:37:19,940
No, no, not, not that one.

955
00:37:19,940 --> 00:37:23,380
It's most commonly associated with hip hop and house music.

956
00:37:24,660 --> 00:37:27,460
Or how most kids do it at my school.

957
00:37:27,460 --> 00:37:29,700
The boy is in the back and the girl is in the front

958
00:37:29,700 --> 00:37:31,780
and they make figure eight movements.

959
00:37:33,060 --> 00:37:33,560
What?

960
00:37:34,260 --> 00:37:34,760
Wow.

961
00:37:35,780 --> 00:37:37,060
That's really complicated.

962
00:37:37,060 --> 00:37:38,740
It's really focused.

963
00:37:38,740 --> 00:37:40,580
Do you go to that fame school?

964
00:37:40,580 --> 00:37:42,900
I said left, Debbie, left.

965
00:37:42,900 --> 00:37:44,100
Jesus Christ.

966
00:37:44,100 --> 00:37:46,660
I am in the league of extraordinary freakers.

967
00:37:47,780 --> 00:37:49,380
I do a figure 16.

968
00:37:49,380 --> 00:37:50,740
Ooh, amazing.

969
00:37:50,740 --> 00:37:51,220
Yeah.

970
00:37:51,220 --> 00:37:54,500
It's basically four, just two figure eights stacked in the end.

971
00:37:54,500 --> 00:37:54,980
I'm sorry.

972
00:37:54,980 --> 00:37:56,260
What is the question?

973
00:37:56,260 --> 00:37:56,500
Yeah.

974
00:37:56,500 --> 00:37:59,540
When grind dancing and a boy gets a boner,

975
00:37:59,540 --> 00:38:00,740
are you supposed to continue?

976
00:38:01,380 --> 00:38:02,260
No, you've won.

977
00:38:02,980 --> 00:38:03,940
That's the end of the game.

978
00:38:04,900 --> 00:38:06,260
That's a pretty good game.

979
00:38:06,260 --> 00:38:07,620
Boner achieved.

980
00:38:07,620 --> 00:38:08,120
Yeah.

981
00:38:08,420 --> 00:38:10,100
You point at his boner and you laugh.

982
00:38:10,100 --> 00:38:10,900
Then you run away.

983
00:38:12,180 --> 00:38:13,700
There's only three stages.

984
00:38:13,700 --> 00:38:16,260
Soft, hard, ground off.

985
00:38:16,260 --> 00:38:16,500
Yeah.

986
00:38:17,140 --> 00:38:19,220
If you keep going, the next thing that happens is

987
00:38:19,220 --> 00:38:20,820
you're going to grind that sucker off.

988
00:38:20,820 --> 00:38:21,220
Yeah.

989
00:38:21,220 --> 00:38:21,860
Into powder.

990
00:38:22,420 --> 00:38:23,860
You mean like broken off?

991
00:38:23,860 --> 00:38:24,420
Like gone?

992
00:38:25,140 --> 00:38:25,460
Yeah.

993
00:38:25,460 --> 00:38:26,740
Like grind it off.

994
00:38:26,740 --> 00:38:28,180
Just be like a nubbin down there.

995
00:38:28,180 --> 00:38:28,820
I gotta-

996
00:38:28,820 --> 00:38:29,380
Stop!

997
00:38:29,380 --> 00:38:29,860
Stop!

998
00:38:29,860 --> 00:38:30,740
Please stop!

999
00:38:30,740 --> 00:38:31,460
Oh god!

1000
00:38:31,460 --> 00:38:33,060
Why are you still going?

1001
00:38:33,060 --> 00:38:35,380
Why do you have a cheese grater in there?

1002
00:38:35,380 --> 00:38:35,700
On there.

1003
00:38:35,700 --> 00:38:36,580
I just have a-

1004
00:38:36,580 --> 00:38:38,580
You left me with a nubby acorn.

1005
00:38:39,140 --> 00:38:40,420
Oh, the sequins!

1006
00:38:40,420 --> 00:38:41,460
The sequins hurt so much!

1007
00:38:41,460 --> 00:38:43,780
Oh god, the sequins are abrasive!

1008
00:38:43,780 --> 00:38:44,340
Why?

1009
00:38:44,340 --> 00:38:46,340
Why is this Maxwell song so long?

1010
00:38:48,180 --> 00:38:50,260
If only we could stop of our own volition.

1011
00:38:52,100 --> 00:38:52,980
Once you get going, man-

1012
00:38:52,980 --> 00:38:56,020
You know what figure eight means is infinity.

1013
00:38:56,020 --> 00:38:56,580
Think about it.

1014
00:38:56,580 --> 00:38:59,300
The mobius strip of grinding is killing my penis.

1015
00:39:01,060 --> 00:39:03,780
It's like a snake eating its own boner.

1016
00:39:05,620 --> 00:39:07,620
Of course you're supposed to continue.

1017
00:39:08,900 --> 00:39:09,620
That's the point.

1018
00:39:09,620 --> 00:39:10,820
Why would you do that thing

1019
00:39:10,820 --> 00:39:13,380
if that wasn't the intended purpose of it?

1020
00:39:13,380 --> 00:39:15,140
I feel like that scene would play out like this.

1021
00:39:15,140 --> 00:39:17,060
Grind dancing, grind dancing, grind-

1022
00:39:17,060 --> 00:39:17,860
Oh my.

1023
00:39:17,860 --> 00:39:21,780
It seems that by pressing my pelvis against your pelvis,

1024
00:39:21,780 --> 00:39:25,380
it's caused some sort of physical arousal to occur.

1025
00:39:25,380 --> 00:39:25,700
I can't help but notice-

1026
00:39:25,700 --> 00:39:26,900
How unexpected.

1027
00:39:28,980 --> 00:39:32,660
I don't understand why a lady is asking this question

1028
00:39:32,660 --> 00:39:33,380
and not a dude.

1029
00:39:33,380 --> 00:39:33,940
Like, what?

1030
00:39:34,980 --> 00:39:35,460
It's a such-

1031
00:39:35,460 --> 00:39:37,620
Should I make her stop grind dancing on me?

1032
00:39:38,580 --> 00:39:39,940
I don't deserve how good it feels.

1033
00:39:39,940 --> 00:39:41,780
No, I mean like-

1034
00:39:41,780 --> 00:39:42,420
I'm ashamed.

1035
00:39:43,060 --> 00:39:46,340
That is a thing that every man in his time has to deal with.

1036
00:39:46,900 --> 00:39:47,140
Nope.

1037
00:39:48,020 --> 00:39:48,420
You're wrong.

1038
00:39:48,420 --> 00:39:49,220
Fuck you.

1039
00:39:49,220 --> 00:39:51,460
You wear it proudly.

1040
00:39:52,420 --> 00:39:56,420
But everybody gets boners when they dance like this,

1041
00:39:56,420 --> 00:39:57,620
in this manner.

1042
00:39:57,620 --> 00:39:58,260
Maybe you didn't-

1043
00:39:58,260 --> 00:39:59,620
I was thinking in the 1950s-

1044
00:39:59,620 --> 00:40:02,740
I don't think I've ever not got a boner when I danced.

1045
00:40:02,740 --> 00:40:04,580
Yeah, especially if you get a figure eight.

1046
00:40:04,580 --> 00:40:06,580
A nice smooth figure eight going, it's guaranteed.

1047
00:40:06,580 --> 00:40:07,780
That's by myself even.

1048
00:40:07,780 --> 00:40:08,900
Yeah.

1049
00:40:08,900 --> 00:40:11,140
If I catch me in a mirror, I'm like, wow.

1050
00:40:11,140 --> 00:40:11,620
What are you-

1051
00:40:11,620 --> 00:40:13,060
It's like young Swayze in there.

1052
00:40:13,620 --> 00:40:14,900
Come on out to play, stud.

1053
00:40:14,900 --> 00:40:16,020
But it's me in the mirror.

1054
00:40:18,100 --> 00:40:19,220
I get so confused.

1055
00:40:19,220 --> 00:40:22,980
I'm like a parrot just tapping on my pecs in there.

1056
00:40:22,980 --> 00:40:24,580
Like, hey, hey, good looking.

1057
00:40:25,140 --> 00:40:25,940
That kind of thing.

1058
00:40:25,940 --> 00:40:28,260
That little, you know, that little chestnut.

1059
00:40:28,260 --> 00:40:30,420
And then do you stop dancing or do you keep dancing?

1060
00:40:30,420 --> 00:40:31,460
I never stopped dancing.

1061
00:40:31,460 --> 00:40:31,940
Oh, that's right.

1062
00:40:31,940 --> 00:40:36,580
I never stopped dancing.

1063
00:40:36,580 --> 00:40:39,380
I don't know what about my autobiography title.

1064
00:40:39,380 --> 00:40:44,180
Never Stop Dancing would lead you to believe that I would at any point stop dancing.

1065
00:40:45,460 --> 00:40:47,460
You can't cry and dance at the same time.

1066
00:40:49,060 --> 00:40:50,020
Yeah, you can.

1067
00:40:50,020 --> 00:40:51,700
Yeah, you sure can.

1068
00:40:51,700 --> 00:40:54,740
And that is the answer to what is art.

1069
00:40:56,900 --> 00:40:57,620
I'm a girl.

1070
00:40:58,420 --> 00:41:00,020
I'm getting ready to go off to college.

1071
00:41:00,020 --> 00:41:00,980
I'm very excited.

1072
00:41:01,540 --> 00:41:03,940
One thing that worries me is that I've never been kissed.

1073
00:41:03,940 --> 00:41:06,580
Is this something I should have experienced by now?

1074
00:41:06,580 --> 00:41:09,860
And will my complete lack of experience scare all the guys away?

1075
00:41:09,860 --> 00:41:10,340
That's from Lucy.

1076
00:41:10,340 --> 00:41:13,780
Oh, no, that's like the best thing.

1077
00:41:13,780 --> 00:41:16,180
Yeah, that's like, that's great.

1078
00:41:16,900 --> 00:41:18,020
You're going to be okay.

1079
00:41:18,980 --> 00:41:21,380
College is high school.

1080
00:41:21,380 --> 00:41:25,220
I don't think is organically built to do a lot of kissing.

1081
00:41:25,220 --> 00:41:27,700
I think people get some kissing done in there.

1082
00:41:28,180 --> 00:41:33,140
But I think that college is even a more flexible environment for for kissing.

1083
00:41:33,140 --> 00:41:35,140
To have to facilitate that.

1084
00:41:36,020 --> 00:41:38,420
Lucy, can I can I share something with you?

1085
00:41:38,420 --> 00:41:42,900
I'm going to tell you a guy's secret and Justin Griffin, feel free to to deny this.

1086
00:41:44,180 --> 00:41:50,820
When a guy meets a girl that he's interested in, he immediately worries about how he compares

1087
00:41:50,820 --> 00:41:54,260
to every guy that she's been with before in every respect.

1088
00:41:55,060 --> 00:41:58,020
And if you were straight up like, nope, you're the you're the first one.

1089
00:41:59,060 --> 00:42:01,780
That guy has got it on easy street.

1090
00:42:01,780 --> 00:42:03,460
I'm not worried about the guy in this situation.

1091
00:42:03,460 --> 00:42:08,580
I'm worried about I'm worried about dear, dear little Lucy here because she she's just

1092
00:42:08,580 --> 00:42:17,380
going to get you high school is good for just getting the shit beat out of you in every

1093
00:42:17,380 --> 00:42:17,860
way.

1094
00:42:17,860 --> 00:42:23,540
What imaginable not like physically, maybe, but like emotionally, spiritually, like you

1095
00:42:23,540 --> 00:42:29,060
are supposed to get fucking hurt in high school, supposed to get destroyed, build up those

1096
00:42:29,060 --> 00:42:36,420
love walls, and I'm worried about you in college, I finding a finding the wrong one, the wrong

1097
00:42:36,420 --> 00:42:37,060
person.

1098
00:42:37,060 --> 00:42:42,820
And that's so late in the game to like get hurt like that to get to get roughed up, you

1099
00:42:42,820 --> 00:42:43,320
know.

1100
00:42:44,420 --> 00:42:46,020
You got to be careful is what I'm saying.

1101
00:42:46,020 --> 00:42:49,780
You got to make sure you can't you can't give your your kiss flower.

1102
00:42:49,780 --> 00:42:50,280
Yes.

1103
00:42:50,280 --> 00:42:52,740
To the first Johnny come lately.

1104
00:42:52,740 --> 00:42:54,580
And you certainly can't call it that.

1105
00:42:54,580 --> 00:42:55,080
No.

1106
00:42:55,940 --> 00:42:56,440
Please.

1107
00:42:56,440 --> 00:42:58,340
Did that not did you not like that?

1108
00:42:58,340 --> 00:42:59,060
Did you not like that?

1109
00:42:59,780 --> 00:43:00,580
Kiss flower?

1110
00:43:00,580 --> 00:43:02,980
No, I think that's pretty much the grossest thing.

1111
00:43:02,980 --> 00:43:07,700
I think that's a good way to keep away all of the crappy dudes and be like, I'm sorry,

1112
00:43:07,700 --> 00:43:09,220
I can't give you my kiss flower.

1113
00:43:09,220 --> 00:43:12,020
I don't want some shifty Lothario to come.

1114
00:43:13,780 --> 00:43:15,860
Oh, God, hey, this is getting worse.

1115
00:43:15,860 --> 00:43:16,360
Uh huh.

1116
00:43:17,060 --> 00:43:23,220
You when you're in high school, you know, the thing about the populations is when you're

1117
00:43:23,220 --> 00:43:29,060
here, as you get into progressively larger populations of humans, the chances that you're

1118
00:43:29,060 --> 00:43:34,260
going to meet somebody who you really, really click with continues to increase.

1119
00:43:35,060 --> 00:43:37,700
So elementary school, no chance.

1120
00:43:37,700 --> 00:43:41,700
No one's ever fallen in love in elementary school, middle school, middle school.

1121
00:43:41,700 --> 00:43:42,500
No, never happened.

1122
00:43:42,500 --> 00:43:44,180
Why don't you go watch the time traveler's wife?

1123
00:43:46,180 --> 00:43:47,220
High school.

1124
00:43:47,220 --> 00:43:48,660
I would rather do that.

1125
00:43:48,660 --> 00:43:49,220
High school.

1126
00:43:50,100 --> 00:43:50,900
Yes, maybe.

1127
00:43:50,900 --> 00:43:53,620
But like when you get to college, the population is so wide.

1128
00:43:53,620 --> 00:43:57,380
You're going to meet a lot of guys that are like, just just your sword.

1129
00:43:57,380 --> 00:43:58,980
And it's not going to be a big deal.

1130
00:43:58,980 --> 00:43:59,940
You know, you kiss once.

1131
00:43:59,940 --> 00:44:01,300
It's like, OK, this problem is over.

1132
00:44:01,860 --> 00:44:02,820
But it's behind you.

1133
00:44:02,820 --> 00:44:05,860
Just don't, you know, don't make yourself sick worrying about this is.

1134
00:44:05,860 --> 00:44:09,380
This is what I'm worried about, though, is that in college I met so many women who are

1135
00:44:09,380 --> 00:44:13,940
just like me, except for one thing, and that was that they were fucking terrible, except

1136
00:44:13,940 --> 00:44:17,540
for the one thing is that they were fucking terrible people like, oh, you're just you

1137
00:44:17,540 --> 00:44:20,500
like all the things I like and we have such similar life experiences.

1138
00:44:20,500 --> 00:44:21,940
Except you're kind of a bitch.

1139
00:44:21,940 --> 00:44:23,380
Like, you kind of suck.

1140
00:44:23,380 --> 00:44:25,860
I kind of don't like being around you.

1141
00:44:25,860 --> 00:44:28,900
But this is but Griffin, that's the human dance.

1142
00:44:28,900 --> 00:44:29,700
It's the experience.

1143
00:44:29,700 --> 00:44:30,340
What about this?

1144
00:44:30,340 --> 00:44:35,700
What Lucy needs is a jaded, bitchy best friend who is older than her.

1145
00:44:35,700 --> 00:44:39,540
Yeah, that's going to straight up when Lucy meets a guy, bitchy best friend is like, I

1146
00:44:39,540 --> 00:44:39,940
don't know.

1147
00:44:39,940 --> 00:44:40,500
I'd watch out.

1148
00:44:40,500 --> 00:44:41,780
He seems like a real douche to me.

1149
00:44:42,580 --> 00:44:43,940
Like so my guy.

1150
00:44:43,940 --> 00:44:45,780
Yeah, friend who's going to like watch your back.

1151
00:44:45,780 --> 00:44:46,820
So sassy.

1152
00:44:46,820 --> 00:44:47,380
I like that.

1153
00:44:47,380 --> 00:44:50,980
Because you're going to lose, he's going to fall, you're going to fall so hard for the

1154
00:44:50,980 --> 00:44:54,100
first time that you that you meet that takes your kiss flower.

1155
00:44:54,100 --> 00:44:58,020
And like, you just you got to make sure that he's a good guy.

1156
00:44:58,020 --> 00:44:59,700
You got to make sure he's a nice guy.

1157
00:44:59,700 --> 00:45:01,620
And don't rush in anything you're not comfortable with.

1158
00:45:01,620 --> 00:45:06,020
Please, Lucy, in in in your excitement over this growing up way too fast.

1159
00:45:06,020 --> 00:45:07,860
Just tell just promises you'll be careful.

1160
00:45:07,860 --> 00:45:08,580
You'll be cool.

1161
00:45:09,140 --> 00:45:13,540
You're not a freak is the most important part because everybody everybody's going it's an

1162
00:45:13,540 --> 00:45:18,180
even terrifying playing field going to college because it's there's nobody knows what they're

1163
00:45:18,180 --> 00:45:18,740
doing there.

1164
00:45:18,740 --> 00:45:22,980
So when I went into when I went into my freshman year in college, I'd never done the butt.

1165
00:45:22,980 --> 00:45:23,780
So exactly.

1166
00:45:24,340 --> 00:45:26,900
The butt is the latest dance craze.

1167
00:45:28,020 --> 00:45:31,860
Just I never there are very few dances that Justin's not proficient at.

1168
00:45:31,860 --> 00:45:33,380
And the butt was one of them.

1169
00:45:33,940 --> 00:45:36,100
Now that number has dropped to zero.

1170
00:45:36,100 --> 00:45:37,460
Except when new ones are invented.

1171
00:45:38,100 --> 00:45:39,060
I'm doing the butt right now.

1172
00:45:40,180 --> 00:45:41,540
I'm doing the ducky.

1173
00:45:41,540 --> 00:45:46,740
Oh, man, Travis, if you get a moment after the call, can you teach me how to dougie?

1174
00:45:46,740 --> 00:45:47,860
Um, I'll see.

1175
00:45:47,860 --> 00:45:48,740
I got some flashcards.

1176
00:45:48,740 --> 00:45:51,220
I could loan you till I'm able to be there.

1177
00:45:51,220 --> 00:45:52,020
That would be great.

1178
00:45:52,020 --> 00:45:55,380
I need something that's sort of like your baby can read.

1179
00:45:56,340 --> 00:45:57,700
But your baby can dougie.

1180
00:45:57,700 --> 00:46:05,780
OK, people seem to really like it last week when I when I bleeped out a swear word and

1181
00:46:05,780 --> 00:46:06,900
they all wanted to know what it was.

1182
00:46:06,900 --> 00:46:11,860
So I think this week I'm going to bleep out because it was really too gross to say.

1183
00:46:12,980 --> 00:46:14,580
So I'm I'm sorry, everybody.

1184
00:46:15,300 --> 00:46:17,540
But did you just say it again or for saying?

1185
00:46:21,060 --> 00:46:22,260
It's going to be a good long beep.

1186
00:46:23,220 --> 00:46:27,300
Hey, and don't ask me what the word don't tweet at me and text me and ask the word is

1187
00:46:27,300 --> 00:46:29,140
because it's a secret for my brother's.

1188
00:46:32,100 --> 00:46:33,860
Will you bleep it out if we say it?

1189
00:46:33,860 --> 00:46:36,820
Um, maybe let's find out.

1190
00:46:36,820 --> 00:46:37,940
Yeah, I think I did.

1191
00:46:37,940 --> 00:46:40,900
OK, so here's another catty.

1192
00:46:40,900 --> 00:46:42,180
Uh, fuck shit.

1193
00:46:42,180 --> 00:46:42,580
Hold on.

1194
00:46:43,140 --> 00:46:43,940
You fucked up.

1195
00:46:44,740 --> 00:46:46,260
Here's another outtakes.

1196
00:46:46,260 --> 00:46:46,760
Fuck!

1197
00:46:47,540 --> 00:46:49,540
So here's another back to school tidbit.

1198
00:46:50,100 --> 00:46:54,100
Um, there's a scene where Derek distracts the opposing team's divers.

1199
00:46:54,100 --> 00:46:58,340
Um, it's not included when it's shown on TV because the actions he takes would have

1200
00:46:58,340 --> 00:47:00,260
gotten him arrested in real life.

1201
00:47:00,260 --> 00:47:02,420
I feel that that's a funny bit of editing.

1202
00:47:02,420 --> 00:47:06,500
If you went through every fucking 80s movie and said, oh, no, in real life, that would

1203
00:47:06,500 --> 00:47:08,500
get them in some serious trouble.

1204
00:47:08,500 --> 00:47:12,100
Like every 80s movie on TV would be like 20 minutes long.

1205
00:47:12,100 --> 00:47:15,780
Yeah, um, that gave us a real doggy doodoo with the lawn.

1206
00:47:15,780 --> 00:47:18,260
Wait a minute, you can't put a horse in that bedroom.

1207
00:47:18,260 --> 00:47:19,300
Get out of here.

1208
00:47:19,300 --> 00:47:20,740
Hear it right out, mister.

1209
00:47:21,780 --> 00:47:27,540
Did you guys know that in the film Billy Madison during the academic decathlon when Billy pulls

1210
00:47:27,540 --> 00:47:32,260
his shoe out of the liquid liquid nitrogen after freezing it, it's a right shoe, but

1211
00:47:32,260 --> 00:47:37,460
he's still wearing his right shoe, little continuity air tucked away in Billy Madison.

1212
00:47:37,460 --> 00:47:39,860
So now we switch from trivia to goofs.

1213
00:47:39,860 --> 00:47:43,540
These are this is our podcast, Top Goofs Movies.

1214
00:47:45,540 --> 00:47:50,020
Guys, the suntan lotion smiley face on Billy's chest at the beginning of the film changes

1215
00:47:50,020 --> 00:47:51,620
drastically between shots.

1216
00:47:53,220 --> 00:47:54,020
Say what?

1217
00:47:54,020 --> 00:47:55,620
Who's watching Billy Madison?

1218
00:47:55,620 --> 00:47:58,980
Say what, who's watching Billy Madison going, whoa, whoa, whoa.

1219
00:47:59,620 --> 00:48:01,780
The frown was bigger than the eyes before.

1220
00:48:02,660 --> 00:48:04,020
I am that person.

1221
00:48:05,300 --> 00:48:06,660
You're not reading these, are you?

1222
00:48:06,660 --> 00:48:08,180
You know these from heart.

1223
00:48:08,180 --> 00:48:10,660
Listen up, Director Tamra Davis.

1224
00:48:10,660 --> 00:48:15,620
You need to do better because that smiley face tan lotion is changes.

1225
00:48:15,620 --> 00:48:20,660
It changed drastically from moment to moment through the course of that one scene.

1226
00:48:20,660 --> 00:48:24,740
Or like his the belly cream is like a frowny face or what?

1227
00:48:24,740 --> 00:48:25,700
What's the deal?

1228
00:48:25,700 --> 00:48:31,700
Guys, I'd like to read you a user review of the movie Billy Madison, if I could.

1229
00:48:35,220 --> 00:48:39,780
This is one of those lucky cases where the opening sequence of a movie gives you an excellent

1230
00:48:39,780 --> 00:48:41,060
idea of what you're in for.

1231
00:48:41,860 --> 00:48:46,180
If you do not enjoy Billy's sunblock song or the bit with the penguin, then you must

1232
00:48:46,180 --> 00:48:49,300
turn off the movie and stop being such a nag about it.

1233
00:48:49,300 --> 00:48:53,380
But for those of us who happen to enjoy movies that are silly and stupid, this is one of

1234
00:48:53,380 --> 00:48:54,420
the best ones out there.

1235
00:48:55,380 --> 00:48:56,420
Seven stars.

1236
00:48:59,460 --> 00:49:00,420
Is that a thing?

1237
00:49:01,460 --> 00:49:01,960
Yep.

1238
00:49:02,580 --> 00:49:05,060
34 out of 49 people found that review useful.

1239
00:49:05,060 --> 00:49:06,020
I'm going to use that.

1240
00:49:08,020 --> 00:49:09,300
I want to use that information.

1241
00:49:09,300 --> 00:49:11,300
That's going straight into my thesis.

1242
00:49:13,300 --> 00:49:15,860
This review may contain spoilers.

1243
00:49:15,860 --> 00:49:17,460
This review may contain spoilers.

1244
00:49:19,860 --> 00:49:20,980
Makes it through school.

1245
00:49:23,700 --> 00:49:24,180
That's it.

1246
00:49:26,260 --> 00:49:32,500
So when Harry and Sally enter the diner in 1977, the credit card sticker on the door

1247
00:49:32,500 --> 00:49:33,540
reads MasterCard.

1248
00:49:33,540 --> 00:49:37,460
But at the time, the company was known as MasterCharge and the current name was only

1249
00:49:37,460 --> 00:49:38,660
adopted in 1979.

1250
00:49:39,860 --> 00:49:41,620
Just something for you guys to think about.

1251
00:49:41,620 --> 00:49:42,120
Awesome.

1252
00:49:43,460 --> 00:49:44,900
That's not really a back to school movie.

1253
00:49:44,900 --> 00:49:46,580
Kangaroo Jack.

1254
00:49:47,540 --> 00:49:48,040
Search.

1255
00:49:49,940 --> 00:49:50,440
Trivia.

1256
00:49:51,540 --> 00:49:56,340
Jerry O'Connell made the worst decision of his life and was in this movie with Anthony

1257
00:49:56,340 --> 00:49:56,840
Anderson.

1258
00:49:58,180 --> 00:50:01,460
You say that, but you don't say that when he gets those $16 residual checks.

1259
00:50:03,380 --> 00:50:04,740
Thanks, Jack.

1260
00:50:04,740 --> 00:50:06,020
I can eat this week.

1261
00:50:07,540 --> 00:50:09,460
He calls it his kangaroo smackers.

1262
00:50:09,460 --> 00:50:16,900
Oh, Jerry O'Connell, I wish I could slide you to another universe where you were still

1263
00:50:16,900 --> 00:50:17,400
doing it.

1264
00:50:18,340 --> 00:50:20,820
I just want some more episodes of My Secret Identity.

1265
00:50:20,820 --> 00:50:22,020
Is that possible?

1266
00:50:22,660 --> 00:50:24,340
God, he's been in a lot of stuff, huh?

1267
00:50:24,340 --> 00:50:24,900
He sure has.

1268
00:50:24,900 --> 00:50:25,940
You can't keep him down.

1269
00:50:26,660 --> 00:50:27,860
Seen him in Piranha 3D.

1270
00:50:27,860 --> 00:50:28,420
He was great.

1271
00:50:29,140 --> 00:50:29,780
Hey, Griffin.

1272
00:50:29,780 --> 00:50:32,260
I think he wrote this Yahoo answer that was sent in.

1273
00:50:32,260 --> 00:50:32,580
Okay.

1274
00:50:32,580 --> 00:50:33,940
Also by Pandapocalypse.

1275
00:50:34,580 --> 00:50:37,620
A rare double from Pandapocalypse.

1276
00:50:37,620 --> 00:50:38,100
Thank you.

1277
00:50:38,100 --> 00:50:40,660
It's by Yahoo Answers user Christian Vaughn, who asks,

1278
00:50:41,540 --> 00:50:45,700
A girl in my science class took my hand and put it on her breast?

1279
00:50:48,100 --> 00:50:49,140
I don't know her that well.

1280
00:50:49,140 --> 00:50:50,660
And does this mean something?

1281
00:50:50,660 --> 00:50:53,460
BTW, I can't find a good category for this one.

1282
00:50:54,020 --> 00:50:54,580
Oh, shit.

1283
00:50:54,580 --> 00:50:55,940
He put it in women's health.

1284
00:50:58,180 --> 00:50:59,060
She wanted a check.

1285
00:51:00,020 --> 00:51:03,460
Hey, could you look for lumps for me real quick in the middle of science class?

1286
00:51:03,460 --> 00:51:04,340
This is science.

1287
00:51:04,340 --> 00:51:05,060
Palpate me.

1288
00:51:05,060 --> 00:51:05,540
I need it.

1289
00:51:06,100 --> 00:51:06,820
I might bleep that one out too.

1290
00:51:06,820 --> 00:51:08,180
Kids are the worst, aren't they?

1291
00:51:08,180 --> 00:51:08,420
Yeah.

1292
00:51:08,980 --> 00:51:10,340
This didn't happen to me.

1293
00:51:10,340 --> 00:51:12,660
I can't tell if this means something.

1294
00:51:12,660 --> 00:51:14,980
Fucking of course it means something.

1295
00:51:14,980 --> 00:51:16,820
How could it not mean something?

1296
00:51:16,820 --> 00:51:19,140
Griffin, but I'm going to tell you a little bit deeper.

1297
00:51:19,140 --> 00:51:24,180
What if he's asking, like, does it mean something in like a Da Vinci code kind of way?

1298
00:51:24,900 --> 00:51:26,420
Does it have a bigger meaning in the-

1299
00:51:26,420 --> 00:51:29,060
Yeah, like what's she telling me about myself?

1300
00:51:29,620 --> 00:51:33,620
I think it means that Jesus had a son.

1301
00:51:34,260 --> 00:51:35,060
That's what Da Vinci-

1302
00:51:35,060 --> 00:51:37,940
The codex has been cracked.

1303
00:51:37,940 --> 00:51:38,820
You've done it, Griffin.

1304
00:51:40,020 --> 00:51:42,020
I mean, like, it means something in the most-

1305
00:51:42,820 --> 00:51:45,620
It means she wanted you to put your fucking hand on her breasts.

1306
00:51:45,620 --> 00:51:47,220
Like, yeah, it meant that thing.

1307
00:51:48,820 --> 00:51:50,900
It means that she's into you and she wants you to-

1308
00:51:50,900 --> 00:51:51,780
Why are you fucking-

1309
00:51:51,780 --> 00:51:54,740
You're on the internet right now and you're fucking typing in a question

1310
00:51:54,740 --> 00:51:58,900
when you could just be squeezing a bosom over and over again all day long.

1311
00:52:00,340 --> 00:52:04,020
This girl in my science class put my hand on her breasts and she said,

1312
00:52:04,020 --> 00:52:05,620
yeah, yeah, get in there.

1313
00:52:05,620 --> 00:52:06,660
Get right in there.

1314
00:52:06,660 --> 00:52:10,660
I want to be inside this kid's head where he's going, huh.

1315
00:52:10,660 --> 00:52:11,940
I want to be inside his hand.

1316
00:52:11,940 --> 00:52:13,460
I feel like this is indicative of something.

1317
00:52:13,460 --> 00:52:14,260
I don't understand.

1318
00:52:14,260 --> 00:52:15,780
She's just playing me hot and cold.

1319
00:52:16,980 --> 00:52:22,420
She's like touching your wiener and you're like, I don't know.

1320
00:52:22,420 --> 00:52:23,620
What does it all mean?

1321
00:52:23,620 --> 00:52:24,180
What is this-

1322
00:52:24,180 --> 00:52:27,300
Griffin, can you cut out the part where I said I wish I was inside the hand

1323
00:52:27,300 --> 00:52:29,060
of the kid squeezing the high school girl's boob?

1324
00:52:29,060 --> 00:52:32,660
No, no.

1325
00:52:32,660 --> 00:52:34,100
But I will turn the volume up.

1326
00:52:36,340 --> 00:52:36,820
Wait a minute.

1327
00:52:36,820 --> 00:52:39,620
That's the opposite thing of the thing that I needed.

1328
00:52:39,620 --> 00:52:42,340
When you heard that audio get pretty bad back there,

1329
00:52:42,340 --> 00:52:46,740
that was that because I had to blast Justin.

1330
00:52:46,740 --> 00:52:51,380
I want to say I'm not sure about the mental state of this girl

1331
00:52:51,380 --> 00:52:54,500
when she needs a hand on her boobs so bad she just reaches out,

1332
00:52:54,500 --> 00:52:58,660
grabs her wrist in the middle of fucking science class and just plants the hand.

1333
00:52:58,660 --> 00:52:59,700
Well, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

1334
00:52:59,700 --> 00:53:01,140
Was this fucking science class?

1335
00:53:01,140 --> 00:53:01,620
Because it makes-

1336
00:53:01,620 --> 00:53:02,740
Oh, that explains everything.

1337
00:53:03,380 --> 00:53:04,100
Yeah, it's pretty cool.

1338
00:53:04,100 --> 00:53:08,740
So you're going to get some blood down in those parts, like engorging it.

1339
00:53:10,900 --> 00:53:15,540
It's going to hit your pleasure nerves in your pleasure cortex.

1340
00:53:15,540 --> 00:53:17,540
It's going to fire all your synapses.

1341
00:53:18,100 --> 00:53:19,140
Is there a worse word?

1342
00:53:19,140 --> 00:53:19,860
Than engorged?

1343
00:53:19,860 --> 00:53:21,060
Engorged.

1344
00:53:21,060 --> 00:53:21,940
I don't think so.

1345
00:53:21,940 --> 00:53:23,460
What if I said engorged?

1346
00:53:23,460 --> 00:53:29,140
Oh, God.

1347
00:53:29,140 --> 00:53:30,660
How do I know if a girl likes me?

1348
00:53:30,660 --> 00:53:34,900
Guys, I think something might be wrong with my ass.

1349
00:53:34,900 --> 00:53:36,180
If you have one, there's something wrong.

1350
00:53:36,180 --> 00:53:37,140
My ass is missing.

1351
00:53:40,580 --> 00:53:42,100
It's a crime of the century.

1352
00:53:42,100 --> 00:53:43,700
That pink panther got in there.

1353
00:53:45,300 --> 00:53:46,260
What a rascal.

1354
00:53:46,820 --> 00:53:47,700
What a rascal.

1355
00:53:47,700 --> 00:53:48,820
Get out of there, you thief.

1356
00:53:49,620 --> 00:53:51,460
Trix Rabbit got bored trying to get Trix.

1357
00:53:51,460 --> 00:53:55,940
He stole my-

1358
00:53:55,940 --> 00:53:58,020
Oh, I'm definitely going to miss one of them.

1359
00:53:58,020 --> 00:53:58,260
Yep.

1360
00:53:59,220 --> 00:54:00,500
I'm not catching all these-

1361
00:54:00,500 --> 00:54:02,740
You gotta catch them all.

1362
00:54:04,500 --> 00:54:06,980
That was actually the plot of my favorite Atari game.

1363
00:54:06,980 --> 00:54:07,540
Catch all my-

1364
00:54:07,540 --> 00:54:10,900
They would fall from above and you'd have a peach basket.

1365
00:54:14,340 --> 00:54:14,900
Hey, listen.

1366
00:54:14,900 --> 00:54:18,980
My wife is completing her teaching credentials for the state of California,

1367
00:54:18,980 --> 00:54:21,460
and will begin teaching the second grade next week.

1368
00:54:21,460 --> 00:54:23,540
It's her first time in the classroom of her own,

1369
00:54:23,540 --> 00:54:25,060
and since we're both big fans of the show,

1370
00:54:25,060 --> 00:54:29,060
I wonder if you have some excellent advice for her to make a good first impression on her students

1371
00:54:29,060 --> 00:54:30,260
and kick the year off right.

1372
00:54:30,260 --> 00:54:30,980
That's from Root.

1373
00:54:31,540 --> 00:54:32,100
Kick a kid.

1374
00:54:32,820 --> 00:54:33,940
Kick a kid right in the-

1375
00:54:34,660 --> 00:54:35,780
Right into the chokey.

1376
00:54:35,780 --> 00:54:36,020
Yeah.

1377
00:54:36,820 --> 00:54:37,780
Then make him eat the cake.

1378
00:54:37,780 --> 00:54:38,580
That's day two.

1379
00:54:39,780 --> 00:54:41,940
I feel like that should be on every syllabus.

1380
00:54:41,940 --> 00:54:43,780
Day one, I'm going to put one of you in the chokey.

1381
00:54:43,780 --> 00:54:44,900
Don't let it be you.

1382
00:54:44,900 --> 00:54:47,540
Day two, one of you is going to eat the whole cake.

1383
00:54:47,540 --> 00:54:51,220
Can you hammer throw a child out the window for eating two M&Ms?

1384
00:54:52,420 --> 00:54:53,220
Fire braids.

1385
00:54:53,220 --> 00:54:53,940
Fire braids.

1386
00:54:53,940 --> 00:54:54,580
Fire pigtails.

1387
00:54:55,380 --> 00:54:58,980
God, there is one person out there who has not seen the hit film Matilda-

1388
00:54:58,980 --> 00:55:00,740
What the fuck are they talking about?

1389
00:55:01,380 --> 00:55:02,420
What are they on?

1390
00:55:02,420 --> 00:55:05,460
But I love that in your mind, everyone else's scene is going,

1391
00:55:05,460 --> 00:55:06,580
oh yeah, okay.

1392
00:55:06,580 --> 00:55:08,580
That is just the fucking best movie.

1393
00:55:08,580 --> 00:55:11,380
Any movie with Rusty Root's Send Me On My Way in the soundtrack

1394
00:55:11,380 --> 00:55:12,820
is pretty much going to be a surefire hit.

1395
00:55:12,820 --> 00:55:13,540
Really, Griffith?

1396
00:55:13,540 --> 00:55:18,180
Because that also includes George of the Jungle with Brendan Fraser.

1397
00:55:18,180 --> 00:55:21,300
That was Dr. Fraser's best work, if you ask me my opinion.

1398
00:55:23,220 --> 00:55:25,860
Does he have an honorary letters degree from somewhere?

1399
00:55:27,620 --> 00:55:31,140
I listened to that song last night during a night of rabble rousing

1400
00:55:31,140 --> 00:55:36,900
and there is not anything better in music than the breakdown at the end of that song

1401
00:55:36,900 --> 00:55:38,980
where the Rusty Root guy's like,

1402
00:55:38,980 --> 00:55:44,100
like just fucking losing it.

1403
00:55:44,100 --> 00:55:45,220
Sounds like a hippie ghost.

1404
00:55:51,700 --> 00:55:54,900
Let's see, she's going to begin teaching the second grade.

1405
00:55:55,780 --> 00:56:00,580
What did I like for my second grade to me is like the last one before it gets tough.

1406
00:56:00,580 --> 00:56:01,140
Oh, shit gets rough.

1407
00:56:01,140 --> 00:56:03,220
When you get third grade, you're going to get multiplication,

1408
00:56:03,220 --> 00:56:07,060
division, and cursive if they're still breaking it down the way they used to.

1409
00:56:07,060 --> 00:56:09,140
They're not doing cursive anymore.

1410
00:56:09,140 --> 00:56:09,860
What?

1411
00:56:09,860 --> 00:56:11,060
Yeah, they've stopped doing cursive.

1412
00:56:11,620 --> 00:56:12,420
No, fuck you.

1413
00:56:12,420 --> 00:56:13,140
Are you kidding?

1414
00:56:13,140 --> 00:56:13,700
Shut up.

1415
00:56:13,700 --> 00:56:14,580
Oh, I swear to God.

1416
00:56:14,580 --> 00:56:16,420
You can't just stop doing cursive.

1417
00:56:16,420 --> 00:56:19,140
You can't because all you got to do is teach a kid how to fucking sign his name.

1418
00:56:20,020 --> 00:56:22,580
And then that's all that's all the letters that they're going to need to know.

1419
00:56:22,580 --> 00:56:24,260
When do you use cursive except to like sign your-

1420
00:56:24,260 --> 00:56:24,980
No joke, guys.

1421
00:56:24,980 --> 00:56:26,580
When was the last time you wrote in cursive?

1422
00:56:26,580 --> 00:56:28,580
Don't you have to use cursive when you write a check?

1423
00:56:29,300 --> 00:56:30,500
That's no.

1424
00:56:30,500 --> 00:56:30,980
What?

1425
00:56:30,980 --> 00:56:32,500
No, that's what I've been doing.

1426
00:56:32,500 --> 00:56:33,780
My bad, my bad.

1427
00:56:33,780 --> 00:56:34,580
You don't do that.

1428
00:56:34,580 --> 00:56:35,380
What the fuck?

1429
00:56:35,380 --> 00:56:38,900
That's why it takes me forever to pay off my debts.

1430
00:56:40,020 --> 00:56:41,860
Are you shitting me right now?

1431
00:56:41,860 --> 00:56:42,820
Can we pause the sh-

1432
00:56:42,820 --> 00:56:44,020
I thought that was the thing.

1433
00:56:44,020 --> 00:56:45,060
I felt like that was the thing.

1434
00:56:45,060 --> 00:56:48,660
Like you had to write the amount in cursive or something.

1435
00:56:48,660 --> 00:56:50,100
Root, I'm very sorry.

1436
00:56:50,100 --> 00:56:52,260
We cannot offer your wife any more practical advice

1437
00:56:52,260 --> 00:56:54,740
because the rest of the episode is about this.

1438
00:56:54,740 --> 00:56:55,620
What the fuck, Travis?

1439
00:56:55,620 --> 00:56:57,780
What the fuck are you talking about?

1440
00:56:57,780 --> 00:56:58,980
Clearly, I'm wrong.

1441
00:56:58,980 --> 00:57:00,420
Clearly, I accept it.

1442
00:57:00,420 --> 00:57:01,220
No, no, no, no, no.

1443
00:57:01,220 --> 00:57:02,260
We're going to incept this.

1444
00:57:02,260 --> 00:57:06,100
We're going to incept this. When did you start thinking

1445
00:57:06,100 --> 00:57:07,620
the whole thing needed to be in cursive?

1446
00:57:07,620 --> 00:57:10,340
I believe it was in fifth grade when we played the Game of Life.

1447
00:57:10,340 --> 00:57:11,540
Or maybe it was sixth grade.

1448
00:57:11,540 --> 00:57:13,140
Game of Life at Comac.

1449
00:57:13,140 --> 00:57:15,620
And we got checkbooks and we had to fill out checks.

1450
00:57:15,620 --> 00:57:18,580
And I believe I was told it had to be in cursive to count.

1451
00:57:18,580 --> 00:57:19,940
And maybe that was just for the game,

1452
00:57:19,940 --> 00:57:22,180
but that carried through the rest of my life.

1453
00:57:22,180 --> 00:57:23,140
So you can do an-

1454
00:57:23,140 --> 00:57:24,260
I'm actually, I flipped it.

1455
00:57:24,260 --> 00:57:26,660
I'm a little jealous right now because if you asked me,

1456
00:57:27,300 --> 00:57:28,260
I could maybe do,

1457
00:57:28,260 --> 00:57:31,780
I'm going to say like 15 lowercase letters in cursive

1458
00:57:31,780 --> 00:57:33,940
and like, no joke, eight uppercase.

1459
00:57:33,940 --> 00:57:36,180
I can do the whole alphabet without thinking.

1460
00:57:36,180 --> 00:57:37,060
Fuck off, man.

1461
00:57:37,060 --> 00:57:38,420
That's so crazy to me.

1462
00:57:38,420 --> 00:57:38,920
Like-

1463
00:57:38,920 --> 00:57:41,140
Now, sometimes I have problems with the S's

1464
00:57:41,140 --> 00:57:43,380
because that shit gets really tricky.

1465
00:57:43,380 --> 00:57:45,940
How come the lowercase letters are so much easier than the-

1466
00:57:45,940 --> 00:57:47,620
Like the lowercase letters seem pretty reasonable.

1467
00:57:47,620 --> 00:57:51,300
Like an N is just like an M and an M is like an M with extra hump.

1468
00:57:51,300 --> 00:57:52,500
Like I get all that.

1469
00:57:52,500 --> 00:57:56,340
But once you get to uppercase, it's like when you make a Q,

1470
00:57:56,340 --> 00:57:59,460
when you make a Q, you have to draw a tiny maze.

1471
00:57:59,460 --> 00:58:00,020
Like-

1472
00:58:00,020 --> 00:58:02,580
My favorite is things like it's a T

1473
00:58:02,580 --> 00:58:04,500
and then you put a line through it and it's an F.

1474
00:58:04,500 --> 00:58:07,380
Like those two letters are so far apart in the alphabet.

1475
00:58:07,380 --> 00:58:09,300
And so it's like, oh, I can just make this an F

1476
00:58:09,300 --> 00:58:10,260
and put a line on it.

1477
00:58:11,060 --> 00:58:12,900
If you told me that you would kill my cat

1478
00:58:12,900 --> 00:58:15,540
if I couldn't draw an uppercase cursive Z,

1479
00:58:15,540 --> 00:58:16,980
I would just start digging a little hole.

1480
00:58:18,900 --> 00:58:19,940
Because this is not going to happen.

1481
00:58:21,300 --> 00:58:22,980
I'm fortunate enough to have a G in my name,

1482
00:58:22,980 --> 00:58:24,740
which is a real tricky character.

1483
00:58:24,740 --> 00:58:26,580
It's got like eight loops in it.

1484
00:58:26,580 --> 00:58:27,620
It's got like a bunch of loops.

1485
00:58:27,620 --> 00:58:29,380
And like, I sometimes I'll bust that out of parties

1486
00:58:29,380 --> 00:58:33,540
because most people, they have erased the uppercase G from their mind

1487
00:58:33,540 --> 00:58:35,940
so that they can remember lyrics to a rusted root song.

1488
00:58:36,660 --> 00:58:38,100
Travis, can you do me a favor?

1489
00:58:38,100 --> 00:58:42,660
Can you, without looking, write a cursive alphabet and scan it?

1490
00:58:42,660 --> 00:58:44,820
Can you do that and put it up on the forums

1491
00:58:44,820 --> 00:58:45,860
so people can see your talent?

1492
00:58:45,860 --> 00:58:46,260
When you say-

1493
00:58:46,260 --> 00:58:46,740
Because I don't believe you.

1494
00:58:46,740 --> 00:58:47,700
When you say without looking,

1495
00:58:47,700 --> 00:58:49,540
you mean like without looking on the internet?

1496
00:58:49,540 --> 00:58:50,100
Without doing any research.

1497
00:58:50,100 --> 00:58:51,620
Without looking at the paper.

1498
00:58:51,620 --> 00:58:53,380
Yeah, without doing any research right now,

1499
00:58:53,380 --> 00:58:55,300
and now, not like right this second,

1500
00:58:55,300 --> 00:58:56,820
but as soon as the show's over, do that.

1501
00:58:56,820 --> 00:58:58,340
Like write the whole cursive alphabet out.

1502
00:58:58,340 --> 00:58:59,300
Yes, I will do this.

1503
00:58:59,300 --> 00:59:01,220
And then scan it or something.

1504
00:59:01,220 --> 00:59:02,260
I will do that.

1505
00:59:02,260 --> 00:59:05,460
Put it up on maximumfun.org forums.

1506
00:59:05,460 --> 00:59:06,100
I will do that.

1507
00:59:06,100 --> 00:59:07,060
Blow everyone's minds.

1508
00:59:07,060 --> 00:59:08,420
Jesus, Travis, you're killing me.

1509
00:59:08,420 --> 00:59:10,180
Let's put this thing in park.

1510
00:59:10,900 --> 00:59:13,140
Okay, I want to hear Griffin's last question.

1511
00:59:13,140 --> 00:59:15,540
I'm kind of freaked out right now, but I do want to hear it.

1512
00:59:16,260 --> 00:59:17,700
This has been my brother and brother and brother and me.

1513
00:59:18,260 --> 00:59:23,220
As you heard, we live at maximumfun.org.

so come and discuss this one.

1517

1521
00:59:40,580 --> 00:59:42,020
This is Jordan Jesse Go.

1522
00:59:42,020 --> 00:59:43,940
There's Judge John Hodgman.

1523
00:59:43,940 --> 00:59:45,860
There's our buddy, stop podcasting yourself.

1524
00:59:45,860 --> 00:59:46,820
You can listen to all those.

1525

Find them there at maximumfun.org.

1526
00:59:48,180 --> 00:59:50,580
We're on Twitter, if you like that.

1527
00:59:50,580 --> 00:59:51,300
That's your jam.

1528
00:59:51,300 --> 00:59:56,900
We're at M-B-A-M is our Twitter name.

1529
00:59:57,700 --> 01:00:00,740
I want to thank John Roderick and the Long Winters

1530
01:00:00,740 --> 01:00:02,340
for the use of their song.

1531
01:00:02,340 --> 01:00:04,660
It's a departure as our theme song

1532
01:00:04,660 --> 01:00:07,620
from the album Putting the Days to Bed,

1533
01:00:07,620 --> 01:00:10,020
which I just assume that everybody's buy at this point

1534
01:00:10,020 --> 01:00:11,700
because it's like the best album.

1535
01:00:11,700 --> 01:00:12,500
Well, here's what you do.

1536
01:00:12,500 --> 01:00:15,780
You buy it, you listen to it, you delete it, you buy it again.

1537
01:00:15,780 --> 01:00:17,860
Yeah, just keep that cycle going.

1538
01:00:17,860 --> 01:00:20,340
You got to refresh because the MP3s, they get dusty.

1539
01:00:20,340 --> 01:00:22,820
They get dusty after about a week or so.

1540
01:00:22,820 --> 01:00:23,860
They'll start to wear out.

1541
01:00:24,980 --> 01:00:27,460
Hey, so we want to thank people who,

1542
01:00:27,460 --> 01:00:28,980
we love it when people tweet about the show.

1543
01:00:28,980 --> 01:00:31,300
They include the M-B-M-B-A-M hashtag

1544
01:00:31,300 --> 01:00:33,620
to use the Twitter part launch.

1545
01:00:33,620 --> 01:00:37,940
Thanks to Jam Cully, Silly Will, Ham Doctors as always,

1546
01:00:37,940 --> 01:00:40,900
Granny Danny, Dan Napolitano.

1547
01:00:43,380 --> 01:00:44,420
Dan Napolitano.

1548
01:00:44,420 --> 01:00:45,860
Yeah, I nailed it first time out.

1549
01:00:45,860 --> 01:00:46,980
Sure, why not?

1550
01:00:46,980 --> 01:00:52,980
Rory, Michelle, Doughty Game, James Gowdy,

1551
01:00:54,100 --> 01:00:56,740
everybody that has talked about us.

1552
01:00:58,260 --> 01:00:59,620
We really do appreciate it.

1553
01:00:59,620 --> 01:01:02,500
Nick, Leith, Nick Reith.

1554
01:01:02,500 --> 01:01:02,900
Sorry.

1555
01:01:02,900 --> 01:01:07,060
My favorite Twitter user is Mr. Face is my favorite.

1556
01:01:07,860 --> 01:01:10,100
I wish you wouldn't say these things to me.

1557
01:01:10,980 --> 01:01:11,300
Sorry.

1558
01:01:11,300 --> 01:01:12,180
Wish you wouldn't do that.

1559
01:01:12,180 --> 01:01:16,100
So just tweet about, you know, our show with some quotes

1560
01:01:16,100 --> 01:01:19,140
or do like some people do and just tweet

1561
01:01:19,140 --> 01:01:21,860
about random things that are happening in their life.

1562
01:01:21,860 --> 01:01:23,700
Like when our buddy Mason, your face got stuck

1563
01:01:23,700 --> 01:01:26,820
in an elevator decided to keep us updated on that.

1564
01:01:26,820 --> 01:01:27,780
I'm glad they got out.

1565
01:01:27,780 --> 01:01:29,060
I appreciated that drama.

1566
01:01:29,060 --> 01:01:30,420
Pretty touch and go there for a while.

1567
01:01:32,580 --> 01:01:33,220
It was pretty good.

1568
01:01:33,220 --> 01:01:36,900
But also you should leave the M-B-A-M hashtag search up

1569
01:01:36,900 --> 01:01:40,180
in your Twitter client of choice because it gets crazy.

1570
01:01:40,180 --> 01:01:41,140
It gets pretty wild.

1571
01:01:41,940 --> 01:01:42,180
Yeah.

1572
01:01:42,900 --> 01:01:44,340
Guys, thank you so much.

1573
01:01:44,340 --> 01:01:45,540
Yeah, thank you as always.

1574
01:01:45,540 --> 01:01:46,260
You guys are the best.

1575
01:01:46,900 --> 01:01:48,180
Share it with a friend if you can.

It's by Yahoo Answers user Vlad T who asks,

1592
01:02:22,740 --> 01:02:24,420
will a horse poop out a wallet

1593
01:02:24,420 --> 01:02:26,740
or will it get stuck somewhere in its digestive system?

1594
01:02:29,860 --> 01:02:30,900
I'm Justin back in school.

1595
01:02:30,900 --> 01:02:32,020
I'm Travis McElroy.

1596
01:02:32,020 --> 01:02:32,900
The horse is in school.

1597
01:02:32,900 --> 01:02:34,260
I'm Griffin McElroy.

1598
01:02:34,260 --> 01:02:35,700
This has been my brother, my brother and me.

1599

Kiss your dad.

1600
01:02:36,340 --> 01:02:37,140

Three stacks.

Three stacks.

1606
01:02:46,100 --> 01:02:47,140
Keep your heart.

1607
01:02:47,140 --> 01:02:48,420
Man, these girls are smart.

These girls are smart.
