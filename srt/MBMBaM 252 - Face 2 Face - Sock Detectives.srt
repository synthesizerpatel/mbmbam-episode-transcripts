1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,080
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:11,400
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:16,760
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there will know how

4
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:21,080
cool they are for listening.

5
00:00:21,080 --> 00:00:22,080
What's up, you cool baby?

6
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:49,080
It's familiar, but not too familiar, but not too not familiar.

7
00:00:49,080 --> 00:01:08,600
I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy.

8
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:13,400
I'm your middle-est brother, Travis McElroy.

9
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:17,680
And I'm your sweet baby brother, Griffin McElroy.

10
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:18,680
Thank you for that.

11
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:21,440
And I'm going to need about half of you to leave.

12
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:28,000
There's too many human beings in this room to watch us do our dick goofs.

13
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,920
I pooped my pants at the drive-over.

14
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:37,760
I didn't want you guys to be the ones to put me on blast on the drive to Chicago and poop

15
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:38,760
my pants.

16
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:43,600
Justin turned to us while we were downstairs in the backstage area, and he said, don't

17
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:47,640
worry guys, I got the opener, I got it covered.

18
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:52,600
I knew that one of you motherfuckers, if I was like, we worked our way around to it,

19
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:55,280
all you would need to hear are the words poop or pants, and you'd be like, you know, I know

20
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:56,800
somebody who pooped his pants accidentally.

21
00:01:56,800 --> 00:02:00,440
That reminds me of an anecdote.

22
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:03,440
So there, I'm the one who said it, I'm owning it.

23
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:07,680
Here's what happened, Charlie pooped her pants, and Justin was like, I can't let her take

24
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:08,680
all this heat.

25
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:09,680
No.

26
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:11,760
This is on me.

27
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:17,040
I thought it was a dress rehearsal, and my butt thought it was opening night, and describe

28
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:23,120
to them, describe, no, but you guys are getting, okay, get ready, this is the show now, because

29
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:26,400
you're getting 10% of the goddamn story right now.

30
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:27,400
My wife kept asking.

31
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:31,600
The 90%, the iceberg below the surface that you don't know is the window of time in which

32
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:37,520
this catastrophe elapsed, Justin, in which the prolapse elapsed, do you want to go ahead

33
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:38,520
and tell us?

34
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:43,680
We were leaving Milwaukee, we'd been on the road for two minutes, and we had been talking

35
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:46,720
about how the architecture of Milwaukee was very varied.

36
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:52,760
And Justin suddenly dropped out of the conversation rather quickly, saying, huh, look at that

37
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:54,280
industrial build.

38
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:57,360
This is strange, because this is one of Justin's favorite conversation topics.

39
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:58,560
Where'd you go, man?

40
00:02:58,560 --> 00:02:59,560
You really dropped the ball.

41
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:00,560
Turns out, he shit his pants.

42
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:03,560
In like two minutes, we literally just left the hotel.

43
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:08,100
And then he was like, we should really stop and get gas before we go too much farther.

44
00:03:08,100 --> 00:03:12,800
And I was like, yeah, we need gas really bad, we should stop somewhere right away.

45
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:14,840
I don't care if we're on the road or not.

46
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:18,200
My wife kept asking me, how did it happen?

47
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:20,280
It's totally the usual, right?

48
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:22,760
It's very erudite of her, as she usually is.

49
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:25,640
It's a fucking terrific question, Justin, how did it happen?

50
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:27,640
You're a 30-something adult man.

51
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:30,760
What I can't say is, it just happened.

52
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:33,080
She said, it doesn't just happen.

53
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:34,080
Just keep living.

54
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:37,740
Life finds a way, baby, chaos theory.

55
00:03:37,740 --> 00:03:40,600
Put that drop of water on your hand, it's not going to roll the same way, because you

56
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:44,040
shit your pants, and it puts some fucking English on the ball or something.

57
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:45,040
I don't know.

58
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:47,000
I changed the course of human history.

59
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,480
You changed the course of our history.

60
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:54,120
This episode's history has been diverted, I would say.

61
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:56,200
Is anybody here never listened to our show before?

62
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:58,860
It's okay.

63
00:03:58,860 --> 00:03:59,960
That's actually a lot of people, actually.

64
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:01,080
I'm kind of uncomfortable now.

65
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:02,520
It doesn't always start this way.

66
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:05,400
What we do, we usually don't shit our pants.

67
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:09,800
Yeah, it's not our M.O., it's self defecation.

68
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:14,960
Sydney really freaked me out, she said, no, it's like breaking the seal.

69
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:18,440
Once you poop your pants in adult life, you're just this sort of person.

70
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:19,440
She's a doctor.

71
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:20,440
She's a doctor.

72
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:22,800
She knows what she's talking about.

73
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:27,400
We take questions, and we turn them alchemy-like into wisdom.

74
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:32,240
See, typically in the intro, we establish that we are authority figures on something,

75
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:33,240
and thereby we are able to give advice.

76
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:34,920
I'm an authority figure on honesty.

77
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:36,400
Yeah, I guess.

78
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:38,980
On forthrightness.

79
00:04:38,980 --> 00:04:39,980
On coming clean.

80
00:04:39,980 --> 00:04:41,680
What is our first question?

81
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:46,120
Chicago has a long history of impressively manly mustaches, a la Mike Ditka.

82
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:51,960
Oh, what's up Chicago?

83
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:57,360
There's a certain amount of authority that comes with some thick Tom Selleck lip foliage.

84
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:04,640
What, as a lady, can I develop as a feature that gives me that instant air of authority?

85
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:07,520
That's from number one Hunnidoll watch fan, and I have one for-

86
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:08,600
So sorry for your loss.

87
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:09,600
So sorry.

88
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:12,600
So sorry to lose the classic bit.

89
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:17,160
And I have one more for you, and it is unibrow.

90
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:19,520
You're saying that's like a high mustache.

91
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:24,120
It takes the mustache, and it moves it up here.

92
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:27,080
Unibrow, it raises the handlebar.

93
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:29,480
That's good.

94
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:32,080
You should be the brand manager.

95
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:33,080
I'm the brand manager.

96
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:36,280
He's the madman of unibrows.

97
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:37,280
Picture this.

98
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:42,280
John Hamm reclining next to a pool, unibrow, no lettuce, just that, and everyone goes,

99
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:43,280
good look.

100
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:44,280
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

101
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:45,280
That's good.

102
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:46,280
That's good.

103
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:47,280
You got the deal.

104
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:48,280
Also, you're drunk at work.

105
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:49,280
Go home.

106
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:50,280
John Hamm.

107
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:51,280
Whoa.

108
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:52,280
You know what's weird?

109
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:54,440
The premiere of Mad Men is airing right this very second.

110
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:55,440
Yeah.

111
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:56,440
So none of these people got that joke.

112
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:57,440
No spoilers.

113
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:58,440
Because obviously they've never seen the show before.

114
00:05:58,440 --> 00:05:59,440
No big Mad Men fans.

115
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:00,440
I assume you'd be home.

116
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:01,440
What about a mustache and a unibrow?

117
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:05,240
It's just a big fucking hairy equals sign on your face.

118
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:09,840
You guys know that it's not like everyone can grow a unibrow by choice.

119
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:11,960
If they just let go of their will for a second.

120
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:12,960
I can't.

121
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:13,960
I can't grow a mustache.

122
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:14,960
Oh, God.

123
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:15,960
I lost my concentration.

124
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:16,960
Right.

125
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:17,960
Yeah.

126
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:20,000
People only spend 10% of their brains because the other 9% are like, don't you grow hair

127
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,860
between my eyebrows.

128
00:06:21,860 --> 00:06:22,860
Don't you do it.

129
00:06:22,860 --> 00:06:23,860
Don't do it.

130
00:06:23,860 --> 00:06:24,860
Oh, man.

131
00:06:24,860 --> 00:06:25,860
Mad Men's on.

132
00:06:25,860 --> 00:06:26,860
Poof.

133
00:06:26,860 --> 00:06:27,860
Shit.

134
00:06:27,860 --> 00:06:28,860
Yeah.

135
00:06:28,860 --> 00:06:29,860
With the Limitless pill, you can grow it.

136
00:06:29,860 --> 00:06:30,860
No.

137
00:06:30,860 --> 00:06:33,800
You could do a beehive hairdo.

138
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:34,800
That's good.

139
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:37,640
No one says shit to that lady.

140
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:41,240
No one's ever cut her in line and expected her to be like, oh, whatever.

141
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:42,240
You got it.

142
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:43,240
They're afraid to cut.

143
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:44,240
They're for bees.

144
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:45,240
Yeah.

145
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:46,240
No, Trav.

146
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:47,240
They don't.

147
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:49,640
What about the renaissance?

148
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:52,560
You know, when they put the bird cages in their giant hairstyle?

149
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:54,360
Oh, with the living bird.

150
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:56,160
With the living bird in there?

151
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:57,160
You could just do that.

152
00:06:57,160 --> 00:06:58,160
I'll do bird.

153
00:06:58,160 --> 00:06:59,800
That's a real power move.

154
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:04,120
That's great because it says, I don't care about living things.

155
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:05,120
Including myself.

156
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:06,120
Including myself.

157
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:07,120
Especially myself.

158
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:12,160
I'm willing for an hour of beauty to be shit on until I get this thing out because that

159
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:13,520
is what happened, you guys.

160
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:17,560
They weren't like thinking about the bird's well-being at that point.

161
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:18,560
It wasn't a pet.

162
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:20,040
You're such an activist up here, man.

163
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:21,040
I'm just saying.

164
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:22,040
Like, you should be keeping this to the goofs.

165
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:24,000
We lost a lot of good birds.

166
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,720
You're getting a little preachy about hair birds.

167
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:27,720
The hair.

168
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:28,720
It's an epidemic.

169
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:30,200
Everybody has it for just pennies a day.

170
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:31,760
You could save these hair birds.

171
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:32,760
How about a...

172
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:36,560
I feel bad for those birds, though, because you know they had to have a moment where they

173
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:39,600
look around like, this is much worse than freedom.

174
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:42,600
I'm in a lady's hair.

175
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:45,120
I think I'm going to die now.

176
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:48,580
And if enough of that happens enough times, eventually you're Brenda Fricker from Home

177
00:07:48,580 --> 00:07:50,640
Alone 2.

178
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:51,640
And her weird hair bird goes.

179
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:55,240
Wait, no, you're not, though, because she didn't kill birds with her hair.

180
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:56,880
Not in the scenes that you saw.

181
00:07:56,880 --> 00:07:58,680
Oh, it hit the cutting room floor.

182
00:07:58,680 --> 00:07:59,680
Get the Blu-Ray, motherfucker.

183
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:00,680
It's all there.

184
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:05,120
No, I feel like we can't leave in the scenes where Brenda kills the birds with her hair.

185
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:06,560
It just sends the wrong message.

186
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:07,560
Too much for kids.

187
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:09,400
That's why every movie has that disclaimer.

188
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:13,560
No animals, including birds, were harmed in the making of this production.

189
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:15,080
They had to put that as the Fricker clause.

190
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:16,080
How about a Yahoo answer?

191
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:17,080
Yes, please.

192
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:18,080
Oh.

193
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:19,080
Ooh.

194
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:24,360
A lot of Yahoo answers fans in the audience.

195
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:27,160
This one was sent in by Ira Ray.

196
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:28,960
Are you Ira Ray?

197
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:31,600
Oh, man.

198
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:38,480
That's too dumb a goof to, like, get a call and response for.

199
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:41,120
Apparently not.

200
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:42,120
Thank you, Ira Ray.

201
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:44,200
It's by Yahoo Answers user.

202
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:47,840
The website won't load.

203
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:49,640
No dogs allowed.

204
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:51,960
I don't think, yeah.

205
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:53,920
Let's say Jordan.

206
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:54,920
Jordash.

207
00:08:54,920 --> 00:08:55,920
Jordash asks.

208
00:08:55,920 --> 00:09:04,720
Jordash asks, any ideas for a sexy tongue trick?

209
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:08,800
At parties, girls will tie knots in cherry stems and the guys will think it's hot.

210
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:14,000
I can do it too, but I wanted to know if there are other tricks like the cherry stem one

211
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:17,080
that I can do to impress everyone.

212
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:25,400
Has any dude ever seen a girl tie a cherry stem with her tongue and thought, that's hot.

213
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:28,920
She could probably tie my wiener with her tongue.

214
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:31,920
I think it's scientifically proven that it can't be done, right?

215
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:32,960
That's crazy.

216
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:35,520
You don't have tongue fingers.

217
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:38,640
What skill does that indicate that a dude's like, awesome.

218
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:39,640
Awesome.

219
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:40,640
Cool.

220
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:41,640
I'd love for you to tie it in a knot.

221
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:47,880
I love it when she twists my wiener.

222
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:52,040
Usually the secret is, you know, your stuff already tied one down your lip and you switch

223
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:53,040
them out.

224
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:54,040
Whoa.

225
00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:55,040
Hold on.

226
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:56,840
Hold on behind the magic.

227
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:57,840
Behind the magic.

228
00:09:57,840 --> 00:10:00,480
Behind the sex magic tricks.

229
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:04,960
I need to go Lance Burton on you guys, but that was the breaks.

230
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:07,320
Hey, Lance keeps his mouth shut.

231
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:10,040
What I'm saying is maybe it doesn't have to be a tied cherry stem.

232
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:13,920
What if you put a regular cherry stem in there, you pull out a stick of Juicy Fruit.

233
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:17,960
Now, basically I see that shit coming.

234
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:19,880
That's sexy.

235
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:20,880
What if you went around- Is it?

236
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:21,880
Wait, hold on.

237
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:22,880
Is it?

238
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:28,320
You pull out some soggy Juicy Fruit and it's like, oh, I'm bonered.

239
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:29,320
I'm 34.

240
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:33,800
I have literally no way of knowing.

241
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:38,400
Can you just go around the party untying everybody else's tied cherry-

242
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:39,400
What a wait.

243
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:40,400
Hold on.

244
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:41,400
Let me see that.

245
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:42,400
What have you tied?

246
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:43,400
Give me that.

247
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:44,400
God.

248
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:45,400
You're welcome.

249
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:46,400
This was a perfectly good cherry stem.

250
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:47,400
What about a whole orange?

251
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:48,400
You put a whole orange in your mouth.

252
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:49,400
And you peel it?

253
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:50,400
Like Mr. Peepers.

254
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:53,120
And then you pull out a peeled orange.

255
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:56,440
That's how Houdini died.

256
00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:57,440
It's not.

257
00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:01,800
I used to have a pretty good sexy tongue trick when I was younger, where I would make a spit

258
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:04,760
bubble and blow it off- Oh no, this is the fucking worst trick in

259
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:05,840
the universe.

260
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:08,600
And everyone saw it and went, I want to have sex with that cherry.

261
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:09,680
You don't understand.

262
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:13,520
He's not talking about blowing spit bubbles like the rest of us normal non-reptilian human

263
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:14,520
beings do.

264
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:15,520
He could like- You know.

265
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:19,520
David Bowie labyrinth like, whoo.

266
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:20,520
He could.

267
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:21,520
Do it.

268
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:22,520
Do it.

269
00:11:22,520 --> 00:11:23,520
Do it.

270
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:24,520
Don't do it.

271
00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:25,520
Don't do it.

272
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:26,520
No, this is not.

273
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:27,520
No, no, no.

274
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:28,520
No, no, no.

275
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:32,720
This is not going to be a bit, because I used to be able to blow them and then blow them

276
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:33,720
off the tongue.

277
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:37,800
But the secret is you have to blow them with a dream.

278
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:40,640
And you have to whisper a dream into them.

279
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:43,240
And I don't have any of those anymore.

280
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:46,080
So it's just a regular spit bubble on the tongue like a peasant.

281
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:48,920
And I'm not going to embarrass myself in front of the Athenians.

282
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:49,920
Yeah.

283
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:50,920
In Chicago.

284
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:53,920
The man who just admitted to shitting his pants 20 minutes ago.

285
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:57,600
I got another question coming in hot.

286
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:04,240
There's a girl in one of my classes who cuts her fingernails during literally every class.

287
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:05,840
Right?

288
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:08,640
This is a challenging episode.

289
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:14,040
It's a small class, only 12 people, and we sit around one big square table across from

290
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:19,080
which I can clearly watch her cutting her nails every day twice a week.

291
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:23,760
We're talking full out nail clippers, little pieces of fingernail flying across the table,

292
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:25,440
clicking noises, the whole deal.

293
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:26,440
Clicking noises?

294
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:27,440
Yeah.

295
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:28,440
We'd assume they're clicking.

296
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:29,440
Well, because of her mandibles.

297
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:30,440
Yeah.

298
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:33,280
This doesn't seem to be bothering anyone else, but it's awful, right?

299
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:34,280
Yeah.

300
00:12:34,280 --> 00:12:35,280
Am I insane?

301
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:40,360
And if not, the bigger question at hand is how do I stop this monster without making

302
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:41,360
it awkward?

303
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:45,160
And that's from Confrontational Clippings in Chicago.

304
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:46,160
What are you here?

305
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:47,160
Right there.

306
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:48,160
Hey.

307
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:53,160
Is it possible that everyone else in the class are gaslighting you?

308
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:54,160
Yeah, it sounds to me.

309
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:59,680
Because it is impossible that there are, what, class of 12, so 10 other people, non-clipper,

310
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:02,760
non-you, that are not upset by this.

311
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:08,400
Because you're sitting in a square which is a shape where everyone's looking at each other.

312
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:09,400
So like, they know.

313
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:10,400
They know.

314
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:15,600
Have you not exchanged words with the other people in class, like, hey, what the fuck,

315
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:17,400
what's going on?

316
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:19,800
We should all drop this class, right?

317
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:20,800
Yeah.

318
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:24,400
Because it's obviously some, it's like in movies and TV where they have the psychology

319
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:28,920
class, but really they're not the students, they're the subjects, and you're being wilded

320
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:29,920
out on.

321
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:30,920
We're being...

322
00:13:30,920 --> 00:13:34,240
Wait, wilded out wasn't the trick show, that was Punk'd.

323
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:35,240
Punk'd was the trick show, everybody.

324
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:36,240
It was the...

325
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:37,800
Wait, which one was wilded out?

326
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:41,400
That was the one where, I don't know, it wasn't the prank show, though, I know that for god

327
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:42,400
damn sure.

328
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:44,340
We're being too hard on this woman.

329
00:13:44,340 --> 00:13:50,040
Maybe this is the only free time she has to clip her nails, single mom, doing her best,

330
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:52,520
non-traditional student.

331
00:13:52,520 --> 00:13:57,440
It's the one time of the week she gets to clip her nails and take a moment for herself.

332
00:13:57,440 --> 00:14:01,600
Maybe there's something about the environment that is conducive to nail clipping.

333
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:02,600
Maybe there's a lot of dreams on the floor.

334
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:06,680
Yeah, like her god damn kids aren't there for a second.

335
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:08,400
Judging her for her fingernails.

336
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:12,120
Judging her, mommy, please pick me up with your long nails.

337
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:13,120
I can't.

338
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:14,120
Hook me through the suspenders.

339
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:17,120
Hook me through the suspenders with your long nails.

340
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:20,800
The problem is, it's not once a week.

341
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:21,800
It's twice a week.

342
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:22,800
It's twice a week.

343
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:23,800
It is two times a week.

344
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:25,600
Who cuts their god damn fingernails twice a week?

345
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:27,280
Okay, the Tuesday is a cut.

346
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:29,320
It's gotta be Tuesday, Thursday, right?

347
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:30,320
This is a class.

348
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:31,320
Is it Tuesday, Thursday?

349
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:32,320
Okay.

350
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:33,320
Oh my god.

351
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:40,120
Within 72 hours, how much of vitamin D?

352
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:45,360
Yeah, it's D. Don't stay out in the sun too long, because then you go back in and it's

353
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:46,360
like, oh god, no.

354
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:47,360
I'm Wolverine.

355
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:53,760
Wolverine can only use his special powers if he gets affected by D.

356
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:54,760
He's solar powered.

357
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:55,760
I'm so, so.

358
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:56,760
Superman's solar powered.

359
00:14:56,760 --> 00:14:57,760
It's not that weird.

360
00:14:57,760 --> 00:15:01,760
I'm so sunburned, but luckily I can scratch wicked good right now.

361
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:05,560
Tuesday is the real cutting day.

362
00:15:05,560 --> 00:15:06,560
Yeah, that's for aesthetics.

363
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:07,560
Thursday, maintenance.

364
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:08,560
Cuticle work.

365
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:09,560
Clean up.

366
00:15:09,560 --> 00:15:10,560
Cuticle work.

367
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:11,560
Filing.

368
00:15:11,560 --> 00:15:13,800
Thursday is for the ones she missed?

369
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:15,360
Thursday is the ones she missed.

370
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:17,920
Oh, I left a lot of corners.

371
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:19,520
Tuesday, trimming.

372
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:21,880
Wednesday, leg day.

373
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:25,440
Thursday, clean up.

374
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:26,440
Eat clean.

375
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:27,440
Train dirty.

376
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:28,440
I don't want to be in her Wednesday class.

377
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:29,440
Yeah, Wednesday.

378
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:31,480
Sorry, what was that gym slogan you just posted out?

379
00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:32,480
Eat clean.

380
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:33,480
Train dirty.

381
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:34,480
Yeah, okay.

382
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:39,320
I saw it on a t-shirt in the Wisconsin Dells, and it made a lot of sense.

383
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:40,320
We're big fans.

384
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:41,320
We're big fans.

385
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:42,320
Please, God.

386
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:45,600
We talked about the Wisconsin Dells for like 15 minutes during last night's show in Milwaukee,

387
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:46,600
and it was unlistenable.

388
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:47,600
How about a Yahoo!

389
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:48,600
Answer?

390
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:49,600
Yeah.

391
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:51,520
You'll get it in post.

392
00:15:51,520 --> 00:15:53,560
This Yahoo! was sent in by Rachel Near.

393
00:15:53,560 --> 00:15:54,560
Thank you, Rachel.

394
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:55,560
It's by Yahoo!

395
00:15:55,560 --> 00:16:01,440
Answer's user, Violetta, who asks, what does it mean?

396
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:09,880
When a guy texts a girl a sad wink emoticon.

397
00:16:09,880 --> 00:16:14,860
Get ready for some really solid audio, people at home.

398
00:16:14,860 --> 00:16:19,960
It looks like this, and then it's a semicolon and a frown thing, so like...

399
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:23,840
Can you guys see that on the Jumbotron pretty clearly?

400
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:26,760
The one I'm assuming is trained on us?

401
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:30,240
You're all doing it right now.

402
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:33,240
What does it mean when a guy texts a girl a sad wink emoticon?

403
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:36,240
What did I say?

404
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:39,240
Wish I was in you.

405
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:40,240
Travis!

406
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:44,240
I said what you said with different words!

407
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:48,240
Yeah, you borrowed a serial killer's tongue.

408
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:53,240
I wish you were the canvas on which I could paint my virginal masterpiece.

409
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:54,240
Oh, no.

410
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:55,240
Whoops.

411
00:16:55,240 --> 00:16:56,240
This is it.

412
00:16:56,240 --> 00:17:01,240
This fucking question's over now, it's done.

413
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:02,240
You guys killed it.

414
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:06,240
You're the unspoiled pasture on which I'll plant my seeds.

415
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:07,240
Oh, man.

416
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:08,240
Is it possible...

417
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:09,240
Anything's possible now.

418
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:16,240
Is it possible he said that he wants to have sex when he lost his eyeball?

419
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:17,240
Today?

420
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:18,240
No.

421
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:22,240
Oh, why'd I climb that tree?

422
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:25,240
Why'd I climb that tree?

423
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:30,240
The leading cause of eyeball fatalities?

424
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:31,240
Eyeball allergy.

425
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:33,240
It's got pointy stems and shit.

426
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:34,240
Yeah, sure.

427
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:35,240
I don't get out in nature a lot.

428
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:36,240
I work on the internet.

429
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:37,240
No, it makes a lot of sense.

430
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:41,240
It's got pointy stems and shit.

431
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:44,240
Whoa, I just got a text alert here.

432
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:45,240
Breaking news.

433
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:46,240
Haunted doll watch.

434
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:50,240
We got a fresh haunted doll coming in hot.

435
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:53,240
If you want him, Terry Gross, come and claim him.

436
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:57,240
Come and get me, Terry.

437
00:17:57,240 --> 00:18:00,240
For those of you who haven't listened to the show before, Terry Gross tried to kill her

438
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:01,240
podcast.

439
00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:07,240
Haunted spirit doll, genie, caution, porcelain doll, five years, orbs, ghosts, EMF.

440
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:08,240
Let me see.

441
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:10,240
It's more SEO themed.

442
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:11,240
She's very...

443
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:12,240
I don't like that one bit.

444
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:13,240
Do not like it.

445
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:16,240
That's the most present any of these doll faces has ever been.

446
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:19,240
Here's a general disclaimer about ghosts in dolls.

447
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:23,240
All spirits take on a special vessel to claim as their home until the point that they do

448
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:24,240
cross over the other side.

449
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:25,240
That may take months.

450
00:18:25,240 --> 00:18:26,240
Boring text.

451
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:27,240
Come on.

452
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:28,240
No, wait, listen.

453
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:32,240
That's going to take months or thousands of years to do so.

454
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:38,240
If you choose a doll to live in for thousands of years, you should have...

455
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:39,240
It's rent control.

456
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:41,240
I get a really good rate on this doll.

457
00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:42,240
I got a great deal on this doll.

458
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:44,240
You guys are focusing on the thousands of years.

459
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:48,240
I focus on the months because it's never less than two months.

460
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:51,240
I'm still unpacking this doll.

461
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:54,240
I haven't even found the good restaurants around the doll yet.

462
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:57,240
Just like us, there's a lot to unpack here.

463
00:18:57,240 --> 00:19:00,240
If you guys are going on one of your comedy bits every time...

464
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:01,240
I'll focus up.

465
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:04,240
This is fucking breaking news.

466
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:07,240
They claim a host for different reasons just like us.

467
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:09,240
They may want it to look a certain way for whatever reason that may be.

468
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:12,240
If they are shy, they may want a mean look.

469
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:14,240
If they're mean, they may want a shy look.

470
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:17,240
You can't trust them.

471
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:19,240
Get a tattoo of this, everybody.

472
00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:25,240
There is absolutely no rhyme or reason of what goes on in the spirit world.

473
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:28,240
That's some racist shit, it seems like.

474
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:31,240
They probably have a pretty goddamn good reason for doing what they do.

475
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:33,240
We just don't understand it.

476
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:35,240
Jeannie was an only child.

477
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:40,240
Born to a couple that had waited until they had their career set and were ready to raise a child.

478
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:43,240
Their names are Joyce and John and they were in their mid-30s.

479
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:44,240
You're just pulling this out of your ass.

480
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:45,240
Hold on.

481
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:47,240
Yes, Travis?

482
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:49,240
Joyce, John and Jeannie?

483
00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:51,240
Joyce, John and Jeannie, that's what they were doing.

484
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:53,240
The family resided in New York but had two homes.

485
00:19:53,240 --> 00:19:55,240
The other was in North Carolina, way up in the mountains.

486
00:19:55,240 --> 00:19:58,240
Jeannie's father had a pilot's license and a small private plane.

487
00:19:58,240 --> 00:19:59,240
Jesus Christ!

488
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:00,240
Okay, fuck you.

489
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:02,240
Sorry, this is what it says.

490
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:05,240
They traveled back and forth and Jeannie loved to be in the air.

491
00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:09,240
And she would have her cute little clothes on and hug her daddy's neck every time.

492
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:11,240
Just before she was strapped in for the ride.

493
00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:15,240
Jeannie, at this point, you may be suspecting that Jeannie dies in a plane crash.

494
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:18,240
No, she doesn't.

495
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:19,240
The plane crashes.

496
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:20,240
Hatch it.

497
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:21,240
She survives.

498
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:22,240
No.

499
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:23,240
Just tale of harrowing.

500
00:20:23,240 --> 00:20:26,240
That would be too obvious.

501
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:28,240
When her mother was sick one winter, Jeannie was five years old.

502
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:30,240
Jeannie and her daddy decided to go it alone.

503
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:36,240
His mother did not want them to miss the huge Christmas tree her grandfather had cut down and decorated just for little Jeannie.

504
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:39,240
It is so unfortunate to say that Jeannie and her daddy...

505
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:40,240
No, stop right there.

506
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:41,240
You got me invested.

507
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:42,240
You got me invested.

508
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:44,240
Please don't kill this child.

509
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:47,240
She's alive right now in my mind, and if she's dead, it's your fault.

510
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:49,240
You're the killer.

511
00:20:49,240 --> 00:20:56,240
It is so unfortunate to say that Jeannie and her daddy crashed as they were coming across the North Carolina line.

512
00:20:56,240 --> 00:21:01,240
The plane had engine trouble, and they looked at Jeannie and told her he loved her as his eyes were pouring tears.

513
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:03,240
And they went down and crashed in a field!

514
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:05,240
This is a doll!

515
00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:08,240
Told her this!

516
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:09,240
This is what...

517
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:10,240
I don't think any of this is true.

518
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:12,240
That doll was lying.

519
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:13,240
She is...

520
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:16,240
Let's talk about Jeannie the doll.

521
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:17,240
She is very...

522
00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:20,240
That's a very glamorous fucking story to make up, too.

523
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:23,240
Yeah, my daddy was a pilot.

524
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:24,240
Pilot is a plane.

525
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:26,240
You fell down some stairs.

526
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:28,240
We had two homes.

527
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:29,240
Nice try.

528
00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:30,240
You climbed a tree wrong.

529
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:31,240
You climbed a tree wrong.

530
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:36,240
You lost your eye and you died, Jeannie, if that is your real name.

531
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:38,240
She is very spoiled.

532
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:40,240
She has got her little mouth on her as well.

533
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:46,240
She says she's not a bad girl, but then she'll haul off and scratch a chair or a table with her nails.

534
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:48,240
She's a doll.

535
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:50,240
She will get into your makeup.

536
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:53,240
And she loves to spray hairspray in her hair.

537
00:21:53,240 --> 00:21:54,240
She...

538
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:55,240
Madam?

539
00:21:55,240 --> 00:21:56,240
Madam.

540
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:57,240
Madam.

541
00:21:57,240 --> 00:21:59,240
You're raising a doll as a baby.

542
00:21:59,240 --> 00:22:00,240
Stop it.

543
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:01,240
It's not...

544
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:04,240
Is it possible Jeannie is her cat?

545
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:05,240
Oh, shit.

546
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:07,240
Yeah.

547
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:08,240
Why do I have to feed my doll?

548
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:10,240
This doesn't make sense.

549
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:12,240
She says she likes her hair.

550
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:15,240
She wears a bonnet so she does not get made fun of.

551
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:17,240
She says she'll punch someone with that.

552
00:22:17,240 --> 00:22:19,240
Look at that stupid fucking doll.

553
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:20,240
Nice hair.

554
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:22,240
Doll.

555
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:23,240
Got him.

556
00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:27,240
Jeannie shows orbs and casts a bright light around her when she is happy.

557
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:28,240
It's always orbs.

558
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:36,240
Just to fucking recap, Jeannie is on sale for $45.

559
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:41,240
Jeannie glows magic baubles when she's...

560
00:22:41,240 --> 00:22:42,240
But 45, I'll let it...

561
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:43,240
No, 50?

562
00:22:43,240 --> 00:22:44,240
Far too much.

563
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:48,240
But what it doesn't say is it takes a lot to make Jeannie happy.

564
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:49,240
You gotta really go out of your way.

565
00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:52,240
We just spent like $60 on pizza.

566
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:57,240
We could have gotten three hot and reddies and a hearted-ass doll instead.

567
00:22:57,240 --> 00:23:01,240
Jeannie is a clumsy spirit...

568
00:23:01,240 --> 00:23:03,240
Jeannie is a clumsy spirit child.

569
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:04,240
She runs funny.

570
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:06,240
Almost like her feet want to cross each other.

571
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:09,240
But she's already afraid of being made fun of, you dick.

572
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:10,240
Yeah.

573
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:11,240
She also runs funny.

574
00:23:11,240 --> 00:23:14,240
She's got stupid hair.

575
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:16,240
Jeannie's spirit vessel is a very clunky doll.

576
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:19,240
She floppies around everywhere and is a handful.

577
00:23:19,240 --> 00:23:25,240
I never let a spirit child go out the door without first explaining where they are going.

578
00:23:25,240 --> 00:23:30,240
To the doll.

579
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:32,240
Now listen.

580
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:37,240
If I search YouTube tonight, I want to find clips of that exact scenario happening.

581
00:23:37,240 --> 00:23:40,240
Hey champ, I'ma listen.

582
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:46,240
I also package them very securely using a lot of new bubble wrap.

583
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:48,240
None of that used shit.

584
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:51,240
If it's used, you run the risk of it being haunted.

585
00:23:51,240 --> 00:23:54,240
And then that's their whole fucking day.

586
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:59,240
If they're attached to a specific item that will go with them at some times, that is their comfort item.

587
00:23:59,240 --> 00:24:01,240
So sometimes they have accessories.

588
00:24:01,240 --> 00:24:03,240
Haunted accessories.

589
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:04,240
I don't know what to tell you, officer.

590
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:10,240
The doll loved this bag of weed.

591
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:12,240
Run it through the spectrometer.

592
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:14,240
That shit ain't mine.

593
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:18,240
It's covered in spiritual residues, officer.

594
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:20,240
Better luck next time.

595
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:23,240
This beludable cocaine might as well be called Slimer.

596
00:24:23,240 --> 00:24:25,240
Look at this thing.

597
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:28,240
It's shooting off EMF and ectoplasm like crazy.

598
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:31,240
No returns.

599
00:24:31,240 --> 00:24:33,240
I don't like this child.

600
00:24:33,240 --> 00:24:39,240
What scenario do you pay $45 for a doll that shoots out glowing light when it's happy?

601
00:24:39,240 --> 00:24:41,240
You said she was a handful.

602
00:24:41,240 --> 00:24:43,240
She's pretty bland.

603
00:24:43,240 --> 00:24:49,240
It's almost like she's made of plastic and cloth and just sits there on the table.

604
00:24:49,240 --> 00:24:50,240
Haunted doll watch.

605
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:51,240
That's haunted doll watch.

606
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:52,240
Haunted doll watch.

607
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:59,240
Sorry, Terry.

608
00:24:59,240 --> 00:25:01,240
Boy, this really takes me back.

609
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:05,240
I like listening back to this because it makes me nostalgic for my human body.

610
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:09,240
Yeah, it seems like so long ago when Griffin wasn't covered in fur.

611
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:12,240
We haven't even talked about how this is going to affect our Pacific Northwest tour.

612
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:15,240
We won't be able to stay in non-pet friendly hotels.

613
00:25:15,240 --> 00:25:18,240
We're going to have to really vacuum out the rental van.

614
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:21,240
You guys have to take me out for walkies.

615
00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:24,240
We might have to stop the shows halfway through if you have to go potty.

616
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:30,240
We've got a lot to consider, but the thing that's on my mind the most is what are we going to put on his crotch?

617
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:31,240
Good news.

618
00:25:31,240 --> 00:25:34,240
Me undies is there for humans and dogs, but not dogs.

619
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:36,240
That's probably not true.

620
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:38,240
It's only good for dogs that used to be humans.

621
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:40,240
Otherwise, it's just going to get confusing for the dog.

622
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:45,240
You've got to cut a little hole in the butt for a little tail to poke through.

623
00:25:45,240 --> 00:25:48,240
Me undies is dedicated to offering the most comfortable underwear that fit great,

624
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:55,240
don't ride up, and literally pull moisture away from your skin so that you're cool all day long.

625
00:25:55,240 --> 00:26:02,240
Now, I don't make as much money now because I'm a dog and I make 50 cents on the dollar.

626
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:11,240
What can I do to knock the price of these fine underwears down to a more manageable level for a dog?

627
00:26:11,240 --> 00:26:13,240
They're already pretty good.

628
00:26:13,240 --> 00:26:16,240
You'd be paying twice this for this level of quality elsewhere,

629
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:22,240
but we can save you an additional 20% off if you go to meundies.com slash my brother,

630
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:25,240
and you get 20% off your first order plus free shipping.

631
00:26:25,240 --> 00:26:31,240
On the checkout page, is there an option to pay with old bones and dead birds and bird bones?

632
00:26:31,240 --> 00:26:33,240
There is, but you don't get the discount.

633
00:26:33,240 --> 00:26:34,240
Son of a bitch.

634
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:35,240
Yeah, it's not available.

635
00:26:35,240 --> 00:26:37,240
They get you coming and going when you're a dog everywhere.

636
00:26:37,240 --> 00:26:40,240
Sorry, but I'll tell you what I'm not sorry about.

637
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:42,240
That's web design.

638
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:45,240
You haven't been sorry about web design since 03.

639
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:47,240
Yeah, I'm not sorry about my web design anymore.

640
00:26:47,240 --> 00:26:49,240
I used to be very sorry, but you know what?

641
00:26:49,240 --> 00:26:50,240
I'm not anymore.

642
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:51,240
Do you know why, Travis?

643
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:53,240
I'm going to take a shot in the dark here, Justin,

644
00:26:53,240 --> 00:26:55,240
and say it's because you use Squarespace now.

645
00:26:55,240 --> 00:26:57,240
What the hell is Squarespace?

646
00:26:57,240 --> 00:26:59,240
It's an all-in-one website platform.

647
00:26:59,240 --> 00:27:02,240
It makes it fast and easy to create your own professional website.

648
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:06,240
None of that shit website you get on like GeoCities that are all just dancing hamsters and shit.

649
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:12,240
Squarespace offers beautiful templates, integration with Google Apps, and getting images and features called cover pages.

650
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:16,240
Now, this is uncomfortable because next week we are going to be sponsored by GeoCities.

651
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:18,240
Oh, no.

652
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:20,240
That's going to be an uncomfy mea culpa.

653
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:25,240
Luckily, every episode is a new Travis, so it's like you reset when the episode ends,

654
00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:30,240
and then we start over, and whatever future Travis says has nothing to do with what present Travis says.

655
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:34,240
Sort of like how I became a dog for this new season.

656
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:35,240
Yeah, sort of.

657
00:27:35,240 --> 00:27:39,240
We basically prestige-drowned Travis, and then there's a new Travis,

658
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:41,240
and you never know which one you're going to get.

659
00:27:41,240 --> 00:27:45,240
If Squarespace sounds good to you, you can start a free trial with no credit card required.

660
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:49,240
Just go to Squarespace.com and use the code MYBROTHER on one word,

661
00:27:49,240 --> 00:27:52,240
and you'll get 10% off of your first purchase.

662
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:53,240
Squarespace.

663
00:27:53,240 --> 00:27:55,240
Build it beautiful.

664
00:27:55,240 --> 00:27:58,240
I would like to reread it like this with a comma in there.

665
00:27:58,240 --> 00:27:59,240
Build it beautiful.

666
00:27:59,240 --> 00:28:02,240
I like that better.

667
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:03,240
Yeah?

668
00:28:03,240 --> 00:28:04,240
A little flirtatious?

669
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:05,240
A little like challenge?

670
00:28:05,240 --> 00:28:09,240
Speaking of beautiful, here's a message for Brown, and it's from Frank.

671
00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:12,240
And Frank says to beautiful Brown,

672
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:14,240
Hot bacon mess.

673
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:20,240
I hope you're having an amazing time in India, and hopefully the curry mouse hasn't eaten all your food.

674
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:24,240
I love you, and I miss your horse and two donks.

675
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:25,240
Hurry back.

676
00:28:25,240 --> 00:28:28,240
Love, cheese mouse, and Chandler the dog too.

677
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:31,240
Sorry.

678
00:28:31,240 --> 00:28:32,240
I got a little aggro there.

679
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:35,240
Just reading the name of another dog, it just fucking sets me off.

680
00:28:35,240 --> 00:28:36,240
I see.

681
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:37,240
Travis, you got another message?

682
00:28:37,240 --> 00:28:38,240
I do.

683
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:41,240
This is maybe my new favorite message.

684
00:28:41,240 --> 00:28:43,240
It's for Christine from Daniel.

685
00:28:43,240 --> 00:28:47,240
Daniel says, next time you go to the grocery store, could you pick up some tortilla chips?

686
00:28:47,240 --> 00:28:48,240
We're out.

687
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:49,240
Well, not completely out.

688
00:28:49,240 --> 00:28:52,240
There's some crumbs in the bottom of the bag, but if I dip those into salsa,

689
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:55,240
I'll probably get salsa on my fingers, and then I'll have salsa fingers.

690
00:28:55,240 --> 00:28:56,240
Gross.

691
00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:59,240
Also, FYI, I gave $100 to NBNBAM.

692
00:28:59,240 --> 00:29:02,240
Love, Daniel.

693
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:06,240
Balancing your checkbook through a podcast that you listen to.

694
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:07,240
I love it.

695
00:29:07,240 --> 00:29:08,240
I love it.

696
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:10,240
It's a service we provide that not a lot of people use.

697
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:14,240
Christine, if you want to take umbrage with Daniel's usage of your money to give to us,

698
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:18,240
just go to MaximumFund.org, first slash Jumbotron,

699
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:21,240
and buy another message telling him that he wastes his money.

700
00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:22,240
Yeah.

701
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:23,240
Drafter responds.

702
00:29:23,240 --> 00:29:26,240
Anyway, back to the show.

703
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:28,240
Thank you all for listening to it.

704
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:32,240
It is our last show in our Midwest tour, if you can call it that.

705
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:35,240
Three shows, in my opinion, does not a tour make.

706
00:29:35,240 --> 00:29:36,240
It does.

707
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:38,240
Speaking of, we've got another tour coming up.

708
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:39,240
Oh yeah.

709
00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:42,240
It's happening at the end of August, August 28th, 29th, and 30th.

710
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:45,240
We're going to be in Portland, Seattle, and Vancouver.

711
00:29:45,240 --> 00:29:48,240
Portland is already sold out, but tickets are still on sale for Seattle and Vancouver.

712
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:53,240
If you go to bit.ly forward slash NBNBAM Seattle,

713
00:29:53,240 --> 00:29:59,240
or bit.ly forward slash van NBNBAM, so V-A-N-M-B-N-B-A-M,

714
00:29:59,240 --> 00:30:01,240
tickets are available there.

715
00:30:01,240 --> 00:30:04,240
It's a signed seating, and they're going fast.

716
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:08,240
The show's still three months away, but by that time, there may not be tickets left.

717
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:09,240
So get them now.

718
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:11,240
Don't wait.

719
00:30:11,240 --> 00:30:12,240
Thank you all for listening.

720
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:16,240
Thank you Chicago people who came to the show on Easter, which is crazy.

721
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:18,240
We really appreciate it.

722
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:19,240
It was a cool night.

723
00:30:19,240 --> 00:30:20,240
It was a real cool night.

724
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:22,240
Here's more of it.

725
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:23,240
Let's get back to it.

726
00:30:23,240 --> 00:30:24,240
Why don't you read this next question?

727
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:25,240
I'm very excited about it.

728
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:31,240
I live with two other people, one guy, one girl, and I think I better slow down.

729
00:30:31,240 --> 00:30:34,240
I'm worried that by the end of the show, I'm going to be really drunk.

730
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:36,240
Like super duper drunk.

731
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:42,240
There are like 800 people that share the same concern right now.

732
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:48,240
I live with two other people, one guy, one girl, and I think my roommates are in love with each other.

733
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:53,240
They fall asleep next to each other on the couch every night and will talk on their phone for hours.

734
00:30:53,240 --> 00:30:54,240
You're going to give that back, right?

735
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:55,240
Yeah.

736
00:30:55,240 --> 00:30:57,240
For hours when one of them isn't at home.

737
00:30:57,240 --> 00:31:00,240
One of them told me they were attracted to the other when they were drunk.

738
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:01,240
See?

739
00:31:01,240 --> 00:31:04,240
Good things happen too.

740
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:08,240
They seem totally incompatible, but they're great roommates.

741
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:15,240
Should I try to get in the way of their love so they don't mess up the vibes for the three of us?

742
00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:20,240
That's from thinking about cock blocking in Chicago.

743
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:25,240
P.S. I just found out the guys are virgin.

744
00:31:25,240 --> 00:31:30,240
Is there a gentleman in the audience right now who just went, ha ha!

745
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:32,240
Oh no.

746
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:33,240
Oh damn.

747
00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:34,240
Oh Jesus.

748
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:36,240
Oh golly.

749
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:39,240
Normally we are like, oh shucks.

750
00:31:39,240 --> 00:31:42,240
Sometimes we're like, is this person here?

751
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:43,240
I don't want to know.

752
00:31:43,240 --> 00:31:46,240
I'm afraid that might ruin just about everybody in the building.

753
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:51,240
Someone shoots their hand up and someone looks at them, hey, I live with you.

754
00:31:51,240 --> 00:31:52,240
Wait a second.

755
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:54,240
What a coinkadoonk.

756
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:58,240
I love this question.

757
00:31:58,240 --> 00:32:07,240
Because what it does is it gives voice to that element that lives within us all that says,

758
00:32:07,240 --> 00:32:12,240
but what does this mean for me?

759
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:20,240
That sees two people cuddling on a couch and goes, but what if this hurts me in some way?

760
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:29,240
If Freud called it the ego, I call it the Travis.

761
00:32:29,240 --> 00:32:36,240
If you were to cut a small scratch in Travis' sternum, it would step out of him.

762
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:42,240
And to me, these are equals three.

763
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:45,240
What's the game plan for splitting up?

764
00:32:45,240 --> 00:32:48,240
Are you going to seduce both of them?

765
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:50,240
What do you think you're going to do?

766
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:54,240
The double fatal attraction.

767
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:58,240
This is a great question, because it's like, how subtle do you go?

768
00:32:58,240 --> 00:33:01,240
When it's like, oh, cuddled on the couch, bed bugs.

769
00:33:01,240 --> 00:33:04,240
Yeah, are you going to leave your dishes out?

770
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:07,240
And then it's like, oh man, Todd left the goddamn dishes out.

771
00:33:07,240 --> 00:33:10,240
Maureen, I don't love you anymore.

772
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:12,240
Good work, Todd.

773
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:15,240
Your dishes made me not love Maureen anymore.

774
00:33:15,240 --> 00:33:17,240
Todd, you ate all my ranch dressing.

775
00:33:17,240 --> 00:33:20,240
I hate you, Maureen.

776
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:24,240
I had a big ranch dressing-themed night planned for myself and Maureen.

777
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:27,240
And you ruined it, and you parted the veil of love.

778
00:33:27,240 --> 00:33:29,240
Only now do I see the truth.

779
00:33:29,240 --> 00:33:31,240
We'd be awful together.

780
00:33:31,240 --> 00:33:36,240
The ranch was keeping us together, and if it's this easy to take us apart, then what's the point?

781
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:40,240
What am I supposed to do with all this celery?

782
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:43,240
I could do ants on a log, but I mean, it would be a shame.

783
00:33:43,240 --> 00:33:44,240
What's the point?

784
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:47,240
Let's talk about a Yahoo answer from the Yahoo answer service.

785
00:33:47,240 --> 00:33:49,240
This one was sent in by Zoe Kinski.

786
00:33:49,240 --> 00:33:50,240
Thank you, Zoe.

787
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:54,240
It's by Yahoo answer's user, Julia M., who asks,

788
00:33:54,240 --> 00:34:05,240
does insurance pay for ripping your butt open?

789
00:34:05,240 --> 00:34:06,240
So.

790
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:08,240
So.

791
00:34:08,240 --> 00:34:12,240
So I had this classmate rip her butt open.

792
00:34:12,240 --> 00:34:19,240
Because she twerked so hard and fell and then ripped it.

793
00:34:19,240 --> 00:34:25,240
Once again, because the next part's so great and I need to build up momentum.

794
00:34:25,240 --> 00:34:29,240
So I had this classmate rip her butt open because she twerked so hard and fell and then ripped it.

795
00:34:29,240 --> 00:34:34,240
I know, right?

796
00:34:34,240 --> 00:34:36,240
What response are you anticipating?

797
00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:39,240
The only thing that happened was, again, I know, right?

798
00:34:39,240 --> 00:34:40,240
God.

799
00:34:40,240 --> 00:34:41,240
Ah, Susan.

800
00:34:41,240 --> 00:34:47,240
She's going to be two people if she's not careful.

801
00:34:47,240 --> 00:34:52,240
I was just wondering if Obamacare pays for stitches everywhere.

802
00:34:52,240 --> 00:34:54,240
Even in your butt.

803
00:34:54,240 --> 00:34:57,240
It's an interesting discussion, my friends, that I had.

804
00:34:57,240 --> 00:34:59,240
What a fascinating discussion.

805
00:34:59,240 --> 00:35:02,240
What are you kids talking about around the lunch table?

806
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:05,240
Obamacare butt stitches.

807
00:35:05,240 --> 00:35:07,240
What a thinker.

808
00:35:07,240 --> 00:35:08,240
This is a true story.

809
00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:09,240
It's really funny.

810
00:35:09,240 --> 00:35:17,240
But seriously, would she be able to be covered even though she literally twerked her ass open?

811
00:35:17,240 --> 00:35:21,240
I love the idea of insurance companies getting together and saying,

812
00:35:21,240 --> 00:35:24,240
where do we draw the line?

813
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:25,240
This far.

814
00:35:25,240 --> 00:35:27,240
No further.

815
00:35:27,240 --> 00:35:31,240
Listen, we are getting too many butt open pieces coming in.

816
00:35:31,240 --> 00:35:32,240
We can't keep paying out.

817
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:36,240
The Anaconda music video came out and just our profits plummeted.

818
00:35:36,240 --> 00:35:39,240
Folks, it's me, Rush Limbaugh.

819
00:35:39,240 --> 00:35:41,240
You'll never believe this one.

820
00:35:41,240 --> 00:35:42,240
Listen to this.

821
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:45,240
Obama's really gone too far this time.

822
00:35:45,240 --> 00:35:50,240
You know the kids, you've heard of kids twerking so hard their butts rip in half?

823
00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:55,240
Well, guess who's stepping in to fill the gap, if you will.

824
00:35:55,240 --> 00:35:59,240
Pardon my French.

825
00:35:59,240 --> 00:36:01,240
That's Obamacare.

826
00:36:01,240 --> 00:36:03,240
That is spot on.

827
00:36:03,240 --> 00:36:05,240
Sell your gold.

828
00:36:05,240 --> 00:36:10,240
To me, Rush Limbaugh.

829
00:36:10,240 --> 00:36:23,240
I think the only way that you get that covered is if you can prove to the insurance company that it was an act of God.

830
00:36:23,240 --> 00:36:27,240
I started the cracker when I finished the job.

831
00:36:27,240 --> 00:36:29,240
Going back for what?

832
00:36:29,240 --> 00:36:30,240
Will insurance even cover it?

833
00:36:30,240 --> 00:36:34,240
Because in the short term, it's going to hurt.

834
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:38,240
But in the long term, it's not bad, right?

835
00:36:38,240 --> 00:36:39,240
Wait, hold on.

836
00:36:39,240 --> 00:36:40,240
What?

837
00:36:40,240 --> 00:36:43,240
Wait, what's your hypothesis?

838
00:36:43,240 --> 00:36:46,240
It's cool to have more space down there?

839
00:36:46,240 --> 00:36:47,240
I didn't think about it.

840
00:36:47,240 --> 00:36:48,240
I just started talking.

841
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:50,240
We'll talk off mic.

842
00:36:50,240 --> 00:36:51,240
Just forget it.

843
00:36:51,240 --> 00:36:52,240
It's dumb.

844
00:36:52,240 --> 00:36:53,240
It's a dumb idea.

845
00:36:53,240 --> 00:36:54,240
Forget it.

846
00:36:54,240 --> 00:36:58,240
One of my local brunch spots offers a fixed price menu.

847
00:36:58,240 --> 00:37:00,240
Approximately $30 per person.

848
00:37:00,240 --> 00:37:02,240
Which includes unlimited coffee.

849
00:37:02,240 --> 00:37:03,240
Wait, why was that funny to you?

850
00:37:03,240 --> 00:37:05,240
Because I know the rest of the thing.

851
00:37:05,240 --> 00:37:06,240
Oh, okay.

852
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:08,240
Unlimited coffee and mini donuts.

853
00:37:08,240 --> 00:37:11,240
M-I-N-I, not M-A-N-Y.

854
00:37:11,240 --> 00:37:12,240
Donuts.

855
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:21,240
In order to optimize this financial investment, keep in mind, this person is among you before I read this next section.

856
00:37:21,240 --> 00:37:30,240
I like to bring a gallon Ziploc bag and stealthily slip donuts into my purse.

857
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:39,240
I feel that I am paying for this food, and if it is truly unlimited, then absconding these pastries is morally sound.

858
00:37:39,240 --> 00:37:47,240
But I can't help feeling guilty, and I avoid eye contact with anyone in my immediate proximity.

859
00:37:47,240 --> 00:37:50,240
Am I good?

860
00:37:50,240 --> 00:37:52,240
That's from Donut Purse.

861
00:37:52,240 --> 00:37:54,240
So when you say...

862
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:55,240
Wait.

863
00:37:55,240 --> 00:37:59,240
Donut Purse, are you here?

864
00:37:59,240 --> 00:38:03,240
I am.

865
00:38:03,240 --> 00:38:11,240
Now hold on.

866
00:38:11,240 --> 00:38:13,240
Stand up, Donut Purse.

867
00:38:13,240 --> 00:38:15,240
Wave to the audience.

868
00:38:15,240 --> 00:38:18,240
That was the fucking funniest thing that's going to happen tonight.

869
00:38:18,240 --> 00:38:20,240
Okay, thank you, Donut Purse.

870
00:38:20,240 --> 00:38:21,240
Okay, wait.

871
00:38:21,240 --> 00:38:22,240
Hold on, wait, wait, wait.

872
00:38:22,240 --> 00:38:23,240
She's got what?

873
00:38:23,240 --> 00:38:27,240
Qualifier.

874
00:38:27,240 --> 00:38:28,240
Oh, it's your sister's question.

875
00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:32,240
Your sister who lives in Canada?

876
00:38:32,240 --> 00:38:38,240
Oink.

877
00:38:38,240 --> 00:38:39,240
Oh my God, you have index cards?

878
00:38:39,240 --> 00:38:41,240
I want to be a fly on that wall.

879
00:38:41,240 --> 00:38:42,240
I have to go, but listen.

880
00:38:42,240 --> 00:38:43,240
Smile.

881
00:38:43,240 --> 00:38:46,240
Speak confidently.

882
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:53,240
Don't start off your thing with, yeah, well.

883
00:38:53,240 --> 00:38:54,240
Here's the thing, and I want you...

884
00:38:54,240 --> 00:38:56,240
I'm going to talk to you.

885
00:38:56,240 --> 00:38:57,240
Wait, wait, wait.

886
00:38:57,240 --> 00:39:00,240
I'm going to take care of people who are listening to a podcast.

887
00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:04,240
The Donut Burglar sister is here.

888
00:39:04,240 --> 00:39:08,240
The Donut Burglar did a fly mess up, but she's not.

889
00:39:08,240 --> 00:39:09,240
But she sent her sister in her stead.

890
00:39:09,240 --> 00:39:12,240
But we are going to speak to you like you're her.

891
00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:15,240
You are going to be the proxy, and you're going to carry this experience home with you

892
00:39:15,240 --> 00:39:17,240
and share it word for word.

893
00:39:17,240 --> 00:39:22,240
So when you say you think it's morally sound,

894
00:39:22,240 --> 00:39:25,240
and then follow that up with,

895
00:39:25,240 --> 00:39:28,240
I feel guilty and don't make eye contact with people,

896
00:39:28,240 --> 00:39:31,240
what you mean is I'm lying to myself.

897
00:39:31,240 --> 00:39:32,240
I'm lying.

898
00:39:32,240 --> 00:39:34,240
It is morally noisy.

899
00:39:34,240 --> 00:39:37,240
There is the substatic and the moral subordinate.

900
00:39:37,240 --> 00:39:38,240
It's morally bankrupt.

901
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:45,240
Because no one's ever done something that they thought was really moral and gone...

902
00:39:45,240 --> 00:39:48,240
No one's saved a cat from a tree like that.

903
00:39:48,240 --> 00:39:51,240
Secret treasures.

904
00:39:51,240 --> 00:39:56,240
Do you know the name of the place where you can get a bunch of donuts?

905
00:39:56,240 --> 00:39:57,240
Asking for a friend.

906
00:39:57,240 --> 00:40:01,240
Because it's apparently easily fucking griftable.

907
00:40:01,240 --> 00:40:02,240
And I want to turn everybody else on.

908
00:40:02,240 --> 00:40:07,240
Do you know the name of this highly griftable establishment?

909
00:40:07,240 --> 00:40:09,240
It doesn't matter the size of the donuts.

910
00:40:09,240 --> 00:40:10,240
There's infinity of them.

911
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:13,240
When you can eat infinity donuts, the size doesn't matter.

912
00:40:13,240 --> 00:40:16,240
If you take a gallon of it, it's like a pound of feathers, a pound of bricks.

913
00:40:16,240 --> 00:40:19,240
It's still a gallon of donut.

914
00:40:19,240 --> 00:40:28,240
If...

915
00:40:28,240 --> 00:40:34,240
She says she doesn't fill the bag, it doesn't matter!

916
00:40:34,240 --> 00:40:36,240
Because that's what the question would lead me to believe.

917
00:40:36,240 --> 00:40:37,240
She's a liar?

918
00:40:37,240 --> 00:40:38,240
Is that what you said?

919
00:40:38,240 --> 00:40:39,240
She's a liar and a thief.

920
00:40:39,240 --> 00:40:42,240
Cool sister.

921
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:43,240
No, come on.

922
00:40:43,240 --> 00:40:44,240
She does sound pretty cool.

923
00:40:44,240 --> 00:40:45,240
I got to say, this sounds pretty fucking bad.

924
00:40:45,240 --> 00:40:47,240
I was talking about her!

925
00:40:47,240 --> 00:40:49,240
She's a liar and a thief!

926
00:40:49,240 --> 00:40:50,240
That's terrible!

927
00:40:50,240 --> 00:40:53,240
That's pretty baller.

928
00:40:53,240 --> 00:40:54,240
Oh, I see.

929
00:40:54,240 --> 00:40:57,240
Because then if she gets caught, they go, hey!

930
00:40:57,240 --> 00:40:59,240
Well, you could have done worse.

931
00:40:59,240 --> 00:41:02,240
You only did a little crime, so...

932
00:41:02,240 --> 00:41:06,240
Last night in...

933
00:41:06,240 --> 00:41:07,240
Milwaukee is where we were last night.

934
00:41:07,240 --> 00:41:11,240
I ate enough salad to earn two cookie points.

935
00:41:11,240 --> 00:41:12,240
200 cookie points.

936
00:41:12,240 --> 00:41:13,240
200 cookie points.

937
00:41:13,240 --> 00:41:16,240
Two cookie vouchers, it's 100 cookie points.

938
00:41:16,240 --> 00:41:19,240
But when I went out to redeem my cookie points from the cookie tray,

939
00:41:19,240 --> 00:41:25,240
there were some tiny mini cookies, and I looked at them and I was like, as if.

940
00:41:25,240 --> 00:41:27,240
I had to work hard for these cookie points.

941
00:41:27,240 --> 00:41:28,240
So I get it.

942
00:41:28,240 --> 00:41:31,240
I get what you're saying about mini donuts.

943
00:41:31,240 --> 00:41:36,240
The interaction I'd be looking for as a patron of Donut Zone,

944
00:41:36,240 --> 00:41:38,240
because we don't know the name of the place yet,

945
00:41:38,240 --> 00:41:42,240
is I would look on this person doing this in horror

946
00:41:42,240 --> 00:41:48,240
until they reach in the back and show me there's another smaller Ziploc bag in here,

947
00:41:48,240 --> 00:41:53,240
and I'm not just like a psychopath with a purse full of loose donuts.

948
00:41:53,240 --> 00:41:57,240
Getting on my checkbook and stuff.

949
00:41:57,240 --> 00:42:01,240
You may think I'm a sticky Vicky, but let me correct your assumptions.

950
00:42:01,240 --> 00:42:02,240
No, it's normal.

951
00:42:02,240 --> 00:42:03,240
There's a bag in here.

952
00:42:03,240 --> 00:42:06,240
It's fine.

953
00:42:06,240 --> 00:42:09,240
So we hope that helps.

954
00:42:09,240 --> 00:42:11,240
Griffin, how about a yahoo?

955
00:42:11,240 --> 00:42:13,240
Yeah, we can do one more yahoo.

956
00:42:13,240 --> 00:42:16,240
We're going to throw it to the audience, too, after this for questions.

957
00:42:16,240 --> 00:42:18,240
There's a mic, I think, in the middle.

958
00:42:18,240 --> 00:42:19,240
Will there be a mic?

959
00:42:19,240 --> 00:42:20,240
Yeah, someone just pointed to it.

960
00:42:20,240 --> 00:42:22,240
It's right there in the middle, so it might be kind of tricky to get to,

961
00:42:22,240 --> 00:42:23,240
but we're going to do a yahoo first.

962
00:42:23,240 --> 00:42:25,240
Does anybody know the rule about questions?

963
00:42:25,240 --> 00:42:26,240
No bummers.

964
00:42:26,240 --> 00:42:27,240
No bummers.

965
00:42:27,240 --> 00:42:28,240
Thank you.

966
00:42:28,240 --> 00:42:29,240
Correct.

967
00:42:29,240 --> 00:42:34,240
This yahoo was sent in by recognize the game of Rachel Sperling.

968
00:42:34,240 --> 00:42:36,240
Take a moment and...

969
00:42:36,240 --> 00:42:38,240
What's that over there?

970
00:42:38,240 --> 00:42:39,240
Oh, it's game.

971
00:42:39,240 --> 00:42:40,240
Yeah.

972
00:42:40,240 --> 00:42:41,240
I see it, and I recognize it.

973
00:42:41,240 --> 00:42:43,240
Thank you, Travis.

974
00:42:43,240 --> 00:42:44,240
Thank you, Rachel.

975
00:42:44,240 --> 00:42:46,240
This yahoo answers user Alicia, who asks,

976
00:42:46,240 --> 00:42:49,240
how do I answer to prom Joker style?

977
00:42:49,240 --> 00:42:55,240
Dark night.

978
00:42:55,240 --> 00:42:58,240
Boyfriend asked me dark night related.

979
00:42:58,240 --> 00:43:00,240
I need to answer in same theme.

980
00:43:00,240 --> 00:43:02,240
Help.

981
00:43:02,240 --> 00:43:04,240
With grammar.

982
00:43:04,240 --> 00:43:05,240
Wait.

983
00:43:05,240 --> 00:43:06,240
One more time.

984
00:43:06,240 --> 00:43:09,240
Boyfriend asked me dark night related.

985
00:43:09,240 --> 00:43:11,240
I need to answer in same theme.

986
00:43:11,240 --> 00:43:12,240
Help.

987
00:43:12,240 --> 00:43:14,240
I love this question for so many reasons.

988
00:43:14,240 --> 00:43:17,240
The first of which is that this guy was like...

989
00:43:17,240 --> 00:43:19,240
Like...

990
00:43:19,240 --> 00:43:23,240
Swear to me that you'll go to prom with me.

991
00:43:23,240 --> 00:43:29,240
And then she was like, that's dope, but hold on.

992
00:43:29,240 --> 00:43:31,240
Tap, tap, tap, tap.

993
00:43:31,240 --> 00:43:32,240
Yahoo answers.

994
00:43:32,240 --> 00:43:33,240
Siri.

995
00:43:33,240 --> 00:43:36,240
Yahoo for me.

996
00:43:36,240 --> 00:43:41,240
How to answer to prom Joker style dark night.

997
00:43:41,240 --> 00:43:47,240
The difference between you and me is I'm not wearing a boutonniere.

998
00:43:47,240 --> 00:43:49,240
Because I'll wear the corsage.

999
00:43:49,240 --> 00:43:51,240
And you'll wear the boutonniere.

1000
00:43:51,240 --> 00:43:55,240
That's a confusing way to say yes to anything.

1001
00:43:55,240 --> 00:43:59,240
Because I'm saying yes.

1002
00:43:59,240 --> 00:44:00,240
That's Batman style.

1003
00:44:00,240 --> 00:44:03,240
Specifically looking for Joker style.

1004
00:44:03,240 --> 00:44:06,240
Not interested in Harvey Dent.

1005
00:44:06,240 --> 00:44:08,240
Not interested in the penguin.

1006
00:44:08,240 --> 00:44:13,240
Why so serious about taking me to prom, yes.

1007
00:44:13,240 --> 00:44:15,240
That's really roundabout, though.

1008
00:44:15,240 --> 00:44:17,240
You're really making him work for it.

1009
00:44:17,240 --> 00:44:23,240
Just leave a Joker card that says, yeah, sure.

1010
00:44:23,240 --> 00:44:27,240
It's not solid, but neither is she from the sound of it.

1011
00:44:27,240 --> 00:44:30,240
You should keep the theme going all night.

1012
00:44:30,240 --> 00:44:36,240
If you get lost on the way to dinner, you're just like, where's macaroni, girl?

1013
00:44:36,240 --> 00:44:39,240
The last word doesn't fit in the quote sign.

1014
00:44:39,240 --> 00:44:41,240
Because I keep it quiet.

1015
00:44:41,240 --> 00:44:44,240
Can you, now hold on.

1016
00:44:44,240 --> 00:44:48,240
Can you blow up and kill Maggie Gyllenhaal?

1017
00:44:48,240 --> 00:44:49,240
Now listen.

1018
00:44:49,240 --> 00:44:50,240
Hold on.

1019
00:44:50,240 --> 00:44:52,240
Hear me out.

1020
00:44:52,240 --> 00:44:53,240
He's going places.

1021
00:44:53,240 --> 00:44:54,240
Hold on.

1022
00:44:54,240 --> 00:44:55,240
Let him finish.

1023
00:44:55,240 --> 00:44:58,240
But then when she explodes because he blew her up and killed her,

1024
00:44:58,240 --> 00:45:02,240
it would spell prom in the air or something and smoke.

1025
00:45:02,240 --> 00:45:05,240
Except it wouldn't say prom because that's not how you answer

1026
00:45:05,240 --> 00:45:07,240
when somebody asks you to prom.

1027
00:45:07,240 --> 00:45:08,240
Do you want to go to prom?

1028
00:45:08,240 --> 00:45:09,240
Prom!

1029
00:45:09,240 --> 00:45:10,240
Hold on.

1030
00:45:10,240 --> 00:45:11,240
Let me kill Maggie Gyllenhaal.

1031
00:45:11,240 --> 00:45:13,240
What does that mean, prom?

1032
00:45:13,240 --> 00:45:15,240
I can't do a second take.

1033
00:45:15,240 --> 00:45:17,240
Kill Jake Gyllenhaal, I guess.

1034
00:45:17,240 --> 00:45:23,240
As I point out in all my reviews for films, there is only one Maggie Gyllenhaal.

1035
00:45:23,240 --> 00:45:25,240
Let's take questions from the audience.

1036
00:45:25,240 --> 00:45:26,240
Okay, great.

1037
00:45:26,240 --> 00:45:27,240
So here's how this works.

1038
00:45:27,240 --> 00:45:28,240
If you have a question.

1039
00:45:28,240 --> 00:45:29,240
Can we get house lights?

1040
00:45:29,240 --> 00:45:30,240
No.

1041
00:45:30,240 --> 00:45:31,240
And also don't make it about you.

1042
00:45:31,240 --> 00:45:32,240
Jesus Christ.

1043
00:45:32,240 --> 00:45:35,240
There's a whole tier of, there's a whole strata.

1044
00:45:35,240 --> 00:45:36,240
Holy shit!

1045
00:45:36,240 --> 00:45:37,240
There's people up there!

1046
00:45:37,240 --> 00:45:38,240
You guys are up there all night!

1047
00:45:38,240 --> 00:45:40,240
Hello!

1048
00:45:40,240 --> 00:45:44,240
This next 20 minutes is going to be a goddamn disaster

1049
00:45:44,240 --> 00:45:46,240
because you just doubled the human.

1050
00:45:46,240 --> 00:45:47,240
Hi.

1051
00:45:47,240 --> 00:45:48,240
Yes, hello.

1052
00:45:48,240 --> 00:45:49,240
Hello.

1053
00:45:49,240 --> 00:45:50,240
So yeah, let's see some.

1054
00:45:50,240 --> 00:45:52,240
No one has stood up.

1055
00:45:52,240 --> 00:45:53,240
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

1056
00:45:53,240 --> 00:45:54,240
Way back there in the middle.

1057
00:45:54,240 --> 00:45:55,240
Yes, you.

1058
00:45:55,240 --> 00:45:56,240
Come on back.

1059
00:45:56,240 --> 00:46:03,240
You're the next contestant of my brother, my brother and me.

1060
00:46:03,240 --> 00:46:04,240
Hello.

1061
00:46:04,240 --> 00:46:05,240
Hi.

1062
00:46:05,240 --> 00:46:06,240
Hello.

1063
00:46:06,240 --> 00:46:07,240
Hi.

1064
00:46:07,240 --> 00:46:08,240
Do I just ask it?

1065
00:46:08,240 --> 00:46:09,240
You say your name.

1066
00:46:09,240 --> 00:46:10,240
Yeah, let her rip.

1067
00:46:10,240 --> 00:46:14,240
Do you got a dope lead up that you can do before you drop?

1068
00:46:14,240 --> 00:46:17,240
You got an intro theme you worked up?

1069
00:46:17,240 --> 00:46:19,240
Here she comes.

1070
00:46:19,240 --> 00:46:21,240
Here's her question.

1071
00:46:21,240 --> 00:46:22,240
Her name's Rebecca.

1072
00:46:22,240 --> 00:46:23,240
Wait, what's your name?

1073
00:46:23,240 --> 00:46:24,240
My name is Tina.

1074
00:46:24,240 --> 00:46:25,240
Oh God, what if I guessed it?

1075
00:46:25,240 --> 00:46:34,240
Ladies and gentlemen, Tina!

1076
00:46:34,240 --> 00:46:35,240
Now go.

1077
00:46:35,240 --> 00:46:36,240
Okay, go.

1078
00:46:36,240 --> 00:46:38,240
And it better be dope now because Travis just...

1079
00:46:38,240 --> 00:46:39,240
Shit.

1080
00:46:39,240 --> 00:46:41,240
I gave myself a huge headache for that.

1081
00:46:41,240 --> 00:46:42,240
Crush it, Tina.

1082
00:46:42,240 --> 00:46:50,240
My boyfriend orders chicken tenders at every restaurant we go to.

1083
00:46:50,240 --> 00:46:52,240
This question's going to rule.

1084
00:46:52,240 --> 00:46:55,240
Tell me he's here, stand up thug.

1085
00:46:55,240 --> 00:46:56,240
Yeah!

1086
00:46:56,240 --> 00:47:00,240
Who's my good, good chicken tender boy?

1087
00:47:00,240 --> 00:47:02,240
Chicken tender boy.

1088
00:47:02,240 --> 00:47:05,240
Who is a connoisseur of Dippin's?

1089
00:47:05,240 --> 00:47:07,240
He only likes ketchup.

1090
00:47:07,240 --> 00:47:08,240
What the fuck?

1091
00:47:08,240 --> 00:47:10,240
He's a man who knows what he likes.

1092
00:47:10,240 --> 00:47:11,240
Yeah.

1093
00:47:11,240 --> 00:47:12,240
All right.

1094
00:47:12,240 --> 00:47:13,240
So go ahead, Tina.

1095
00:47:13,240 --> 00:47:14,240
Sorry.

1096
00:47:14,240 --> 00:47:16,240
So my question is, how can I make him more adventurous?

1097
00:47:16,240 --> 00:47:19,240
Give him some chicken firms.

1098
00:47:19,240 --> 00:47:20,240
What?

1099
00:47:20,240 --> 00:47:21,240
That sucks.

1100
00:47:21,240 --> 00:47:24,240
That's not a...

1101
00:47:24,240 --> 00:47:30,240
That's where you drop the mic into the garbage and find a new career.

1102
00:47:30,240 --> 00:47:31,240
Chicken firms.

1103
00:47:31,240 --> 00:47:32,240
Where were we?

1104
00:47:32,240 --> 00:47:36,240
Can you cut them up and say now you're into nugs?

1105
00:47:36,240 --> 00:47:37,240
Those are basically nugs.

1106
00:47:37,240 --> 00:47:38,240
What happens...

1107
00:47:38,240 --> 00:47:40,240
Wait, this is a serious question.

1108
00:47:40,240 --> 00:47:43,240
What happens if you're at a restaurant that does not have chicken tenders?

1109
00:47:43,240 --> 00:47:44,240
Yeah.

1110
00:47:44,240 --> 00:47:46,240
I guess he just doesn't eat anything.

1111
00:47:46,240 --> 00:47:47,240
It breaches into his pocket.

1112
00:47:47,240 --> 00:47:48,240
Wait, hold on.

1113
00:47:48,240 --> 00:47:51,240
Tina, have you not run into this situation yet?

1114
00:47:51,240 --> 00:47:52,240
Do you call ahead?

1115
00:47:52,240 --> 00:47:53,240
Listen.

1116
00:47:53,240 --> 00:47:54,240
I mean...

1117
00:47:54,240 --> 00:47:55,240
It's me, Tina.

1118
00:47:55,240 --> 00:47:57,240
Do you have tenders?

1119
00:47:57,240 --> 00:47:58,240
Tell me honest.

1120
00:47:58,240 --> 00:48:00,240
I'm not going to make a reservation.

1121
00:48:00,240 --> 00:48:02,240
Most restaurants have a kid's menu, so...

1122
00:48:02,240 --> 00:48:03,240
Sure, right.

1123
00:48:03,240 --> 00:48:04,240
That's true.

1124
00:48:04,240 --> 00:48:05,240
Or a...

1125
00:48:05,240 --> 00:48:06,240
What's your boyfriend's name?

1126
00:48:06,240 --> 00:48:07,240
Rob.

1127
00:48:07,240 --> 00:48:09,240
Or a Rob's menu is what we're calling it from now on.

1128
00:48:09,240 --> 00:48:10,240
Hey, listen.

1129
00:48:10,240 --> 00:48:14,240
I think it's totally cool.

1130
00:48:14,240 --> 00:48:15,240
Why is that, Travis?

1131
00:48:15,240 --> 00:48:16,240
Okay.

1132
00:48:16,240 --> 00:48:23,240
If you're a person who knows that clearly what you're into, why the fuck not?

1133
00:48:23,240 --> 00:48:24,240
Rob, Rob.

1134
00:48:24,240 --> 00:48:26,240
Did you know you're a chicken tendersman?

1135
00:48:26,240 --> 00:48:27,240
Yeah, yeah.

1136
00:48:27,240 --> 00:48:29,240
Rob, Rob, my sweet chicken...

1137
00:48:29,240 --> 00:48:30,240
Just thumbs up and thumbs down.

1138
00:48:30,240 --> 00:48:36,240
Rob, chicken tender boy, did you remember the first time you had chicken tenders?

1139
00:48:36,240 --> 00:48:40,240
Do you remember the first time you had chicken tenders and you were like, yes.

1140
00:48:40,240 --> 00:48:41,240
This is it.

1141
00:48:41,240 --> 00:48:42,240
This is it.

1142
00:48:42,240 --> 00:48:43,240
I found you.

1143
00:48:43,240 --> 00:48:45,240
More importantly, do you remember the last time you had chicken tenders?

1144
00:48:45,240 --> 00:48:46,240
This is the last time you had anything else.

1145
00:48:46,240 --> 00:48:47,240
I finally found someone.

1146
00:48:47,240 --> 00:48:48,240
Someone, T.

1147
00:48:48,240 --> 00:48:53,240
You ever hear that rubbish I said, dude?

1148
00:48:53,240 --> 00:48:54,240
Yeah, sure.

1149
00:48:54,240 --> 00:48:55,240
Love Rob for Rob.

1150
00:48:55,240 --> 00:48:56,240
If they make you...

1151
00:48:56,240 --> 00:48:59,240
Do chicken tenders make you happy, Rob?

1152
00:48:59,240 --> 00:49:00,240
Yeah.

1153
00:49:00,240 --> 00:49:01,240
Okay, it's a...

1154
00:49:01,240 --> 00:49:02,240
Yeah, we're good.

1155
00:49:02,240 --> 00:49:03,240
Tina.

1156
00:49:03,240 --> 00:49:06,240
Don't worry about what we think.

1157
00:49:06,240 --> 00:49:07,240
Hey, Tina, big shot.

1158
00:49:07,240 --> 00:49:08,240
Hey, Tina, big shot.

1159
00:49:08,240 --> 00:49:12,240
What do you get at restaurants that's so cool?

1160
00:49:12,240 --> 00:49:14,240
Thank you, Tina.

1161
00:49:14,240 --> 00:49:16,240
No, I want to know the answer to that question.

1162
00:49:16,240 --> 00:49:17,240
What do you get at restaurants that's so cool?

1163
00:49:17,240 --> 00:49:20,240
You answered one thing you got at a restaurant last time.

1164
00:49:20,240 --> 00:49:21,240
Oh, God.

1165
00:49:21,240 --> 00:49:27,240
We went to Giordano's and I got a stuffed pizza with pepperoni and peppers in it.

1166
00:49:27,240 --> 00:49:28,240
That sounds pretty good.

1167
00:49:28,240 --> 00:49:29,240
That actually sounds pretty good.

1168
00:49:29,240 --> 00:49:30,240
Good job.

1169
00:49:30,240 --> 00:49:31,240
Okay, good job.

1170
00:49:31,240 --> 00:49:32,240
Thank you, Tina.

1171
00:49:32,240 --> 00:49:33,240
Tina, you're better than Rob.

1172
00:49:33,240 --> 00:49:34,240
Next.

1173
00:49:34,240 --> 00:49:35,240
Yeah, you're right up here.

1174
00:49:35,240 --> 00:49:36,240
Come on.

1175
00:49:36,240 --> 00:49:37,240
Yeah, come on in the middle.

1176
00:49:37,240 --> 00:49:38,240
Yes, yes.

1177
00:49:38,240 --> 00:49:39,240
Hello.

1178
00:49:39,240 --> 00:49:42,240
We're going to do some non-metal people next, I promise.

1179
00:49:42,240 --> 00:49:47,240
Okay, my cat always orders chicken tenders.

1180
00:49:47,240 --> 00:49:50,240
What is your name first and then goofs?

1181
00:49:50,240 --> 00:49:51,240
Matt.

1182
00:49:51,240 --> 00:49:52,240
Matt.

1183
00:49:52,240 --> 00:49:53,240
Matt, goof away.

1184
00:49:53,240 --> 00:49:54,240
All right.

1185
00:49:54,240 --> 00:49:56,240
Don't do the same goof again.

1186
00:49:56,240 --> 00:49:59,240
That's our thing.

1187
00:49:59,240 --> 00:50:03,240
My cat is a jerk to my girlfriend's cat and I feel like I have to choose between my cat

1188
00:50:03,240 --> 00:50:05,240
and my girlfriend.

1189
00:50:05,240 --> 00:50:11,240
Which one of them do you have sex with?

1190
00:50:11,240 --> 00:50:12,240
Can I?

1191
00:50:12,240 --> 00:50:13,240
Wait.

1192
00:50:13,240 --> 00:50:14,240
Can I?

1193
00:50:14,240 --> 00:50:22,240
That's a one-word answer, homie.

1194
00:50:22,240 --> 00:50:23,240
Can I say that in Illinois?

1195
00:50:23,240 --> 00:50:24,240
Yeah.

1196
00:50:24,240 --> 00:50:25,240
I don't know.

1197
00:50:25,240 --> 00:50:28,240
We're not from here, dude.

1198
00:50:28,240 --> 00:50:29,240
Abstain.

1199
00:50:29,240 --> 00:50:30,240
Yeah, okay.

1200
00:50:30,240 --> 00:50:35,240
You should.

1201
00:50:35,240 --> 00:50:38,240
Why are these two cats... Do you live together?

1202
00:50:38,240 --> 00:50:39,240
No.

1203
00:50:39,240 --> 00:50:42,240
Why the fuck are your cats having meetings of the mind?

1204
00:50:42,240 --> 00:50:45,240
It's not a double date.

1205
00:50:45,240 --> 00:50:46,240
Right.

1206
00:50:46,240 --> 00:50:50,240
We've run out of things to talk about without the two of them there.

1207
00:50:50,240 --> 00:50:53,240
Is it a Krang situation where the cat's embedded in your chest?

1208
00:50:53,240 --> 00:50:56,240
Because if not, leave it the fuck at home.

1209
00:50:56,240 --> 00:50:57,240
It's cool there.

1210
00:50:57,240 --> 00:50:59,240
It likes it there.

1211
00:50:59,240 --> 00:51:00,240
Also, here's the thing.

1212
00:51:00,240 --> 00:51:02,240
I don't know how much you know about cats.

1213
00:51:02,240 --> 00:51:06,240
It's a really long, prolonged process to introduce cats to each other.

1214
00:51:06,240 --> 00:51:07,240
Oh, here we go.

1215
00:51:07,240 --> 00:51:08,240
You don't get to just throw them into a room.

1216
00:51:08,240 --> 00:51:09,240
Fucking Jackson Galaxy.

1217
00:51:09,240 --> 00:51:10,240
Right.

1218
00:51:10,240 --> 00:51:11,240
Jackson Galaxy's never rolled up.

1219
00:51:11,240 --> 00:51:12,240
Guys, sorry.

1220
00:51:12,240 --> 00:51:13,240
You got to split up.

1221
00:51:13,240 --> 00:51:14,240
You got to break up.

1222
00:51:14,240 --> 00:51:15,240
I'm Jackson Galaxy.

1223
00:51:15,240 --> 00:51:16,240
There's no hope here.

1224
00:51:16,240 --> 00:51:17,240
It's just it.

1225
00:51:17,240 --> 00:51:18,240
Your love's over.

1226
00:51:18,240 --> 00:51:19,240
Or you can leave your cat at home.

1227
00:51:19,240 --> 00:51:20,240
One of the two.

1228
00:51:20,240 --> 00:51:21,240
Does that help?

1229
00:51:21,240 --> 00:51:22,240
Yeah.

1230
00:51:22,240 --> 00:51:23,240
I don't... We're not cat behavior psychologists.

1231
00:51:23,240 --> 00:51:24,240
I did it.

1232
00:51:24,240 --> 00:51:25,240
Hold on.

1233
00:51:25,240 --> 00:51:26,240
I did it.

1234
00:51:26,240 --> 00:51:27,240
I mean, no.

1235
00:51:27,240 --> 00:51:28,240
Not at all.

1236
00:51:28,240 --> 00:51:29,240
Okay.

1237
00:51:29,240 --> 00:51:30,240
Thank you.

1238
00:51:30,240 --> 00:51:31,240
Thank you.

1239
00:51:31,240 --> 00:51:32,240
Thank you.

1240
00:51:32,240 --> 00:51:33,240
I appreciate your honesty.

1241
00:51:33,240 --> 00:51:34,240
Right here.

1242
00:51:34,240 --> 00:51:35,240
Right here.

1243
00:51:35,240 --> 00:51:36,240
I'm looking at you.

1244
00:51:36,240 --> 00:51:37,240
Yes, you.

1245
00:51:37,240 --> 00:51:38,240
Stand up.

1246
00:51:38,240 --> 00:51:39,240
Yes, you.

1247
00:51:39,240 --> 00:51:40,240
Yeah.

1248
00:51:40,240 --> 00:51:41,240
Crowdsurf.

1249
00:51:41,240 --> 00:51:42,240
Come on over.

1250
00:51:42,240 --> 00:51:43,240
Crowd, help her.

1251
00:51:43,240 --> 00:51:44,240
I'm done catering to the middle.

1252
00:51:44,240 --> 00:51:45,240
Hello.

1253
00:51:45,240 --> 00:51:46,240
Hi.

1254
00:51:46,240 --> 00:51:47,240
My name is Abby.

1255
00:51:47,240 --> 00:51:48,240
Hi, Abby.

1256
00:51:48,240 --> 00:51:49,240
And me and my boyfriend, Cory, are from St. Louis.

1257
00:51:49,240 --> 00:51:50,240
Cory.

1258
00:51:50,240 --> 00:51:51,240
Yay.

1259
00:51:51,240 --> 00:51:52,240
All right.

1260
00:51:52,240 --> 00:51:53,240
How about those cardinals?

1261
00:51:53,240 --> 00:51:54,240
Woo.

1262
00:51:54,240 --> 00:51:55,240
Perfect.

1263
00:51:55,240 --> 00:51:56,240
Jesus, Travis.

1264
00:51:56,240 --> 00:51:57,240
Whoa.

1265
00:51:57,240 --> 00:51:58,240
She just took an elevator down to another show.

1266
00:51:58,240 --> 00:51:59,240
I heard night veils downstairs.

1267
00:51:59,240 --> 00:52:00,240
Boo.

1268
00:52:00,240 --> 00:52:01,240
Woo.

1269
00:52:01,240 --> 00:52:02,240
Okay.

1270
00:52:02,240 --> 00:52:03,240
So this is not a bummer.

1271
00:52:03,240 --> 00:52:08,240
It's a more serious question than cat problems.

1272
00:52:08,240 --> 00:52:09,240
All right.

1273
00:52:09,240 --> 00:52:10,240
Fuck.

1274
00:52:10,240 --> 00:52:11,240
So you just put him in his place.

1275
00:52:11,240 --> 00:52:12,240
And it won't blast.

1276
00:52:12,240 --> 00:52:13,240
Go ahead.

1277
00:52:13,240 --> 00:52:14,240
Okay.

1278
00:52:14,240 --> 00:52:20,760
So I would say like I have a lot of good friends and we get along, we have a great time, but

1279
00:52:20,760 --> 00:52:23,840
it's always me doing the inviting.

1280
00:52:23,840 --> 00:52:26,360
This is some messed up etiquette in my opinion.

1281
00:52:26,360 --> 00:52:28,240
If I don't ask, it doesn't happen.

1282
00:52:28,240 --> 00:52:31,640
And so I'll wait and I'll wait for an invitation and then it has to be me.

1283
00:52:31,640 --> 00:52:32,640
Can I ask?

1284
00:52:32,640 --> 00:52:33,640
Is he here?

1285
00:52:33,640 --> 00:52:34,640
Can I ask you a question?

1286
00:52:34,640 --> 00:52:35,640
Yes.

1287
00:52:35,640 --> 00:52:36,640
I'm sorry.

1288
00:52:36,640 --> 00:52:37,640
I didn't catch your first name.

1289
00:52:37,640 --> 00:52:38,640
Abby.

1290
00:52:38,640 --> 00:52:39,640
Abby.

1291
00:52:39,640 --> 00:52:40,640
She didn't give her last name either.

1292
00:52:40,640 --> 00:52:42,640
I didn't catch her social security number.

1293
00:52:42,640 --> 00:52:45,640
Abby, are you likable?

1294
00:52:45,640 --> 00:52:46,640
Wow.

1295
00:52:46,640 --> 00:52:47,640
Wow.

1296
00:52:47,640 --> 00:52:48,640
Jesus, Justin.

1297
00:52:48,640 --> 00:52:49,640
Abby.

1298
00:52:49,640 --> 00:52:52,640
She's inviting me to another thing.

1299
00:52:52,640 --> 00:52:53,640
Is it pot?

1300
00:52:53,640 --> 00:52:54,640
No.

1301
00:52:54,640 --> 00:52:55,640
Do you only love paintball?

1302
00:52:55,640 --> 00:52:56,640
Now that is a good question.

1303
00:52:56,640 --> 00:52:57,640
That's a good question.

1304
00:52:57,640 --> 00:53:03,280
It's always specifically frothing, I can't.

1305
00:53:03,280 --> 00:53:05,920
Which is frog golfing, in case you were wondering.

1306
00:53:05,920 --> 00:53:06,920
Frog golfing?

1307
00:53:06,920 --> 00:53:07,920
Yeah.

1308
00:53:07,920 --> 00:53:08,920
It's big with the kids.

1309
00:53:08,920 --> 00:53:09,920
They eat frogs.

1310
00:53:09,920 --> 00:53:10,920
And not as big with the frogs.

1311
00:53:10,920 --> 00:53:11,920
No, the frogs hate it.

1312
00:53:11,920 --> 00:53:12,920
Frogs hate it.

1313
00:53:12,920 --> 00:53:19,080
Are your events like, frothing aside, are your events like sick?

1314
00:53:19,080 --> 00:53:23,960
Is there platters of food?

1315
00:53:23,960 --> 00:53:24,960
I'm a caterer.

1316
00:53:24,960 --> 00:53:25,960
No.

1317
00:53:25,960 --> 00:53:29,240
I like talking and having coffee, going to see movies, all that good stuff.

1318
00:53:29,240 --> 00:53:30,600
Humans are Pavlovian beings.

1319
00:53:30,600 --> 00:53:33,720
If you keep doing it, they're going to wait for, yes.

1320
00:53:33,720 --> 00:53:39,160
Do you have a dope place and your friends are all boxcar children?

1321
00:53:39,160 --> 00:53:41,160
All your friends are a group of ragamuffins.

1322
00:53:41,160 --> 00:53:42,160
All right.

1323
00:53:42,160 --> 00:53:43,160
Well, all right.

1324
00:53:43,160 --> 00:53:47,840
So then I just had to make the parties doper, and then they'll just start coming on their

1325
00:53:47,840 --> 00:53:48,840
own.

1326
00:53:48,840 --> 00:53:49,840
No.

1327
00:53:49,840 --> 00:53:50,840
No.

1328
00:53:50,840 --> 00:53:51,840
That's not.

1329
00:53:51,840 --> 00:53:54,840
Abby, I feel like you're not listening, but that's all the time we have for you.

1330
00:53:54,840 --> 00:54:01,600
Abby, ladies and gentlemen.

1331
00:54:01,600 --> 00:54:03,400
That guy's working his ass off.

1332
00:54:03,400 --> 00:54:04,400
Come on down, pal.

1333
00:54:04,400 --> 00:54:05,400
Yes, sir.

1334
00:54:05,400 --> 00:54:10,120
I mean, you're literally as far away as a person on the balcony could at least hurl

1335
00:54:10,120 --> 00:54:11,120
their body off.

1336
00:54:11,120 --> 00:54:13,120
Oh, and he's going the long way.

1337
00:54:13,120 --> 00:54:14,120
Could go out through the lobby, but instead.

1338
00:54:14,120 --> 00:54:15,120
Oh, look at him.

1339
00:54:15,120 --> 00:54:16,120
He's going outside.

1340
00:54:16,120 --> 00:54:17,120
Just go around.

1341
00:54:17,120 --> 00:54:18,120
So many penis grazes.

1342
00:54:18,120 --> 00:54:19,120
Oh, come on down.

1343
00:54:19,120 --> 00:54:20,120
And here he is.

1344
00:54:20,120 --> 00:54:21,120
All right.

1345
00:54:21,120 --> 00:54:22,120
What's your name, buddy?

1346
00:54:22,120 --> 00:54:23,120
Bobby.

1347
00:54:23,120 --> 00:54:24,120
Hey, Bobby.

1348
00:54:24,120 --> 00:54:26,680
I like you already, Bobby.

1349
00:54:26,680 --> 00:54:27,680
Go ahead.

1350
00:54:27,680 --> 00:54:28,680
I'm proud of you.

1351
00:54:28,680 --> 00:54:31,320
So I recently went on a date with somebody, and that next morning...

1352
00:54:31,320 --> 00:54:32,320
Nice.

1353
00:54:32,320 --> 00:54:33,320
Little braggy.

1354
00:54:33,320 --> 00:54:36,320
It was a little braggy, right?

1355
00:54:36,320 --> 00:54:37,320
Bye, Bobby.

1356
00:54:37,320 --> 00:54:38,320
That's it.

1357
00:54:38,320 --> 00:54:39,320
Bobby just wanted to let y'all know.

1358
00:54:39,320 --> 00:54:40,320
Bobby, Twitter now.

1359
00:54:40,320 --> 00:54:41,320
I had sex.

1360
00:54:41,320 --> 00:54:42,320
Later.

1361
00:54:42,320 --> 00:54:43,320
Bobby, go on.

1362
00:54:43,320 --> 00:54:44,320
Bobby, sorry.

1363
00:54:44,320 --> 00:54:45,320
Bobby, sorry.

1364
00:54:45,320 --> 00:54:46,320
That was very rude, Bobby.

1365
00:54:46,320 --> 00:54:47,320
I'm sorry.

1366
00:54:47,320 --> 00:54:51,240
Classic us and classic Bobby.

1367
00:54:51,240 --> 00:54:54,080
That next morning, when it came time for her to leave, we realized we couldn't find one

1368
00:54:54,080 --> 00:54:55,080
of her socks.

1369
00:54:55,080 --> 00:54:56,080
This is...

1370
00:54:56,080 --> 00:54:57,080
Okay.

1371
00:54:57,080 --> 00:55:03,640
And that was about two weeks ago, and I spent the last two weeks receiving text messages

1372
00:55:03,640 --> 00:55:07,740
from her asking, where's my sock?

1373
00:55:07,740 --> 00:55:10,240
So what's your question, Bobby?

1374
00:55:10,240 --> 00:55:12,800
Bobby, where is the sock?

1375
00:55:12,800 --> 00:55:13,800
We don't know, Bob.

1376
00:55:13,800 --> 00:55:17,800
Do we have a number for a good sock detective?

1377
00:55:17,800 --> 00:55:20,800
Oh, he's got his sock.

1378
00:55:20,800 --> 00:55:24,000
The worm has churned.

1379
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:27,400
Bob is holding the sock above his head.

1380
00:55:27,400 --> 00:55:30,760
Now this is a fucking radio drama.

1381
00:55:30,760 --> 00:55:31,760
Bobby's holding the sock.

1382
00:55:31,760 --> 00:55:34,000
He is say anything-ing the sock.

1383
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:37,960
This is the way Bob continue.

1384
00:55:37,960 --> 00:55:43,200
Or don't, because why the fuck do you have this sock, Bobby?

1385
00:55:43,200 --> 00:55:46,680
Everyone be aware of the fact that Bobby had some night during his prep for the evening.

1386
00:55:46,680 --> 00:55:51,440
You created a circle of trust, and then you stepped outside of it with another human

1387
00:55:51,440 --> 00:55:52,440
being's sock.

1388
00:55:52,440 --> 00:55:56,280
Bob, before he left the house this evening, said, I'm asking that question.

1389
00:55:56,280 --> 00:55:57,280
I'm asking.

1390
00:55:57,280 --> 00:55:58,280
I'm breaking that sock.

1391
00:55:58,280 --> 00:55:59,280
I'm taking that sock.

1392
00:55:59,280 --> 00:56:03,120
And you can't pretend like you didn't, because you got fucking prop comedy in the mix, Bobby.

1393
00:56:03,120 --> 00:56:09,720
Hey, by the way, do we not have security at this theater that is frisking people for socks?

1394
00:56:09,720 --> 00:56:11,400
So what's your question, Bob?

1395
00:56:11,400 --> 00:56:12,400
Bob.

1396
00:56:12,400 --> 00:56:14,320
Yesterday in my laundry, I found the sock.

1397
00:56:14,320 --> 00:56:19,560
How do I get the sock back to her without- You fucking hold a Tibetan sky burial for

1398
00:56:19,560 --> 00:56:20,560
it and hope for the best.

1399
00:56:20,560 --> 00:56:29,560
You throw it into a flock of birds overhead, and if it happens, it happens.

1400
00:56:29,560 --> 00:56:33,200
Because there's no nine creepy way, Bobby.

1401
00:56:33,200 --> 00:56:34,200
Not now.

1402
00:56:34,200 --> 00:56:39,560
Bob, you return it and just say, I used it up.

1403
00:56:39,560 --> 00:56:43,000
Robert.

1404
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:44,000
She's a listener, Robert.

1405
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:45,520
Bob, here's what you do.

1406
00:56:45,520 --> 00:56:47,320
You leave the sock here tonight.

1407
00:56:47,320 --> 00:56:48,320
Okay.

1408
00:56:48,320 --> 00:56:54,240
If it is meant to be- Bob, you ever see serendipity?

1409
00:56:54,240 --> 00:56:55,240
Leave it in the laundromat.

1410
00:56:55,240 --> 00:56:58,960
If it turns up on her foot again in 10 years, you're meant to be.

1411
00:56:58,960 --> 00:57:00,840
Stitch your phone number into it or something?

1412
00:57:00,840 --> 00:57:01,840
I don't know.

1413
00:57:01,840 --> 00:57:02,840
I don't know.

1414
00:57:02,840 --> 00:57:06,920
I'm not a John Cusack expert, Robert.

1415
00:57:06,920 --> 00:57:07,920
You weirdo.

1416
00:57:07,920 --> 00:57:08,920
Thank you for coming.

1417
00:57:08,920 --> 00:57:09,920
Thank you very much.

1418
00:57:09,920 --> 00:57:10,920
Thank you so much for coming.

1419
00:57:10,920 --> 00:57:11,920
I hope this was helpful.

1420
00:57:11,920 --> 00:57:12,920
Thank you, Bob.

1421
00:57:12,920 --> 00:57:13,920
Remember?

1422
00:57:13,920 --> 00:57:14,920
All right.

1423
00:57:14,920 --> 00:57:17,200
Chicago, thank you so much for having us.

1424
00:57:17,200 --> 00:57:19,760
You've been really fun and super cool and nice.

1425
00:57:19,760 --> 00:57:20,760
This is it.

1426
00:57:20,760 --> 00:57:21,760
This is the end of our tour.

1427
00:57:21,760 --> 00:57:22,760
The end of our first tour.

1428
00:57:22,760 --> 00:57:27,760
The end of our three-show tour.

1429
00:57:27,760 --> 00:57:35,240
We are ending it in the city where we did our first ever live show here in Chicago.

1430
00:57:35,240 --> 00:57:36,240
Five years ago?

1431
00:57:36,240 --> 00:57:37,240
Fuck.

1432
00:57:37,240 --> 00:57:38,240
Fuck.

1433
00:57:38,240 --> 00:57:39,240
Yeah.

1434
00:57:39,240 --> 00:57:40,240
No, four years ago.

1435
00:57:40,240 --> 00:57:41,240
Four years ago.

1436
00:57:41,240 --> 00:57:42,240
Much better.

1437
00:57:42,240 --> 00:57:47,640
We did it in the second city for about one-twentieth this many people.

1438
00:57:47,640 --> 00:57:48,640
This is insane, by the way.

1439
00:57:48,640 --> 00:57:49,640
This is insane.

1440
00:57:49,640 --> 00:57:50,640
You're all amazing.

1441
00:57:50,640 --> 00:57:56,560
Thank you so, so much for this night.

1442
00:57:56,560 --> 00:57:57,560
We want to say...

1443
00:57:57,560 --> 00:57:58,560
You're saying...

1444
00:57:58,560 --> 00:57:59,560
Atheneum.

1445
00:57:59,560 --> 00:58:00,560
Yeah.

1446
00:58:00,560 --> 00:58:01,560
Atheneum.

1447
00:58:01,560 --> 00:58:02,560
Whatever you're saying.

1448
00:58:02,560 --> 00:58:03,560
Atheneum is right.

1449
00:58:03,560 --> 00:58:04,560
Atheneum?

1450
00:58:04,560 --> 00:58:05,560
Atheneum?

1451
00:58:05,560 --> 00:58:06,560
Atheneum.

1452
00:58:06,560 --> 00:58:07,560
I knew it the first time.

1453
00:58:07,560 --> 00:58:08,560
You did.

1454
00:58:08,560 --> 00:58:09,560
This is a beautiful, awesome theater.

1455
00:58:09,560 --> 00:58:10,560
Yeah.

1456
00:58:10,560 --> 00:58:11,560
And they've been super nice.

1457
00:58:11,560 --> 00:58:13,920
Travis has told me this three times tonight, but go ahead.

1458
00:58:13,920 --> 00:58:21,120
It's 104 years old, and it should be a historical landmark, but you see in 1970, they upgraded

1459
00:58:21,120 --> 00:58:26,240
the elevator, and now they won't award it National Historic Landmark status, which is

1460
00:58:26,240 --> 00:58:27,240
bullshit.

1461
00:58:27,240 --> 00:58:28,240
Yeah.

1462
00:58:28,240 --> 00:58:30,840
I will say, I don't think they upgraded the plumbing in 1970, because I'm pretty sure

1463
00:58:30,840 --> 00:58:35,360
I pooped wrong downstairs and destroyed the entire building.

1464
00:58:35,360 --> 00:58:39,760
It seems right to say this here, because we did our first live show here, thank you so

1465
00:58:39,760 --> 00:58:43,500
much to everybody out in the audience for listening to our show, for however many years

1466
00:58:43,500 --> 00:58:44,500
you've been listening.

1467
00:58:44,500 --> 00:58:45,560
We sincerely appreciate it.

1468
00:58:45,560 --> 00:58:49,560
We recorded it so we could have more of an opportunity to talk to each other on a weekly

1469
00:58:49,560 --> 00:58:53,680
basis, and the fact that so many of you like and enjoy it means the world to us.

1470
00:58:53,680 --> 00:58:54,680
Thank you so much.

1471
00:58:54,680 --> 00:58:55,680
It's incredibly humbling.

1472
00:58:55,680 --> 00:58:56,680
Thank you.

1473
00:58:56,680 --> 00:58:58,480
Also, I meant to say at the beginning of the show, he is risen!

1474
00:58:58,480 --> 00:59:01,480
There it is.

1475
00:59:01,480 --> 00:59:03,720
How about on that note...

1476
00:59:03,720 --> 00:59:07,120
Oh, thank you to John Roderick and the Long Winters for the spread theme song.

1477
00:59:07,120 --> 00:59:08,120
It's an apart trophy.

1478
00:59:08,120 --> 00:59:09,120
I'm gonna put in the days to bed.

1479
00:59:09,120 --> 00:59:14,320
And don't forget, there's the amazing posters that are special for this show out in the

1480
00:59:14,320 --> 00:59:15,320
lobby.

1481
00:59:15,320 --> 00:59:19,320
It talks about this show on here, and it's really nice paper and everything, so you should

1482
00:59:19,320 --> 00:59:20,320
buy it.

1483
00:59:20,320 --> 00:59:21,320
It's really quality paper.

1484
00:59:21,320 --> 00:59:22,320
Quality paper.

1485
00:59:22,320 --> 00:59:23,320
Final Yahoo?

1486
00:59:23,320 --> 00:59:24,320
Final Yahoo?

1487
00:59:24,320 --> 00:59:25,320
Yes, please.

1488
00:59:25,320 --> 00:59:26,320
Final Yahoo.

1489
00:59:26,320 --> 00:59:30,920
I got one Final Yahoo, one to go on.

1490
00:59:30,920 --> 00:59:32,920
This Final Yahoo answer was sent...

1491
00:59:32,920 --> 00:59:33,920
Whoa, what was that?

1492
00:59:33,920 --> 00:59:34,920
You just getting ready?

1493
00:59:34,920 --> 00:59:35,920
Just bracing, baby.

1494
00:59:35,920 --> 00:59:36,920
Hit me.

1495
00:59:36,920 --> 00:59:39,920
This Final Yahoo was sent in by...

1496
00:59:39,920 --> 00:59:41,920
Get in the zone.

1497
00:59:41,920 --> 00:59:42,920
Sorry.

1498
00:59:42,920 --> 00:59:48,560
Justin just did like a fucking gone in 60 seconds maneuver that Nicholas Cazier...

1499
00:59:48,560 --> 00:59:49,560
That was me.

1500
00:59:49,560 --> 00:59:50,560
All right, let's go.

1501
00:59:50,560 --> 00:59:51,560
Do you want to know seriously what it was?

1502
00:59:51,560 --> 00:59:54,960
It was me setting my drink down so I'd have a free hand to take the bottle of Hennessy

1503
00:59:54,960 --> 00:59:55,960
backstage.

1504
00:59:55,960 --> 00:59:56,960
Okay.

1505
00:59:56,960 --> 00:59:57,960
Go ahead.

1506
00:59:57,960 --> 01:00:01,200
Behind the curtain with my brother and my brother and me.

1507
01:00:01,200 --> 01:00:02,200
By Bill Andrews.

1508
01:00:02,200 --> 01:00:03,200
Thank you, Bill Andrews.

1509
01:00:03,200 --> 01:00:09,520
Final Yahoo answer is user Jerry Wayland, who asks, will there be reggae in the future?

1510
01:00:09,520 --> 01:00:10,520
Say your name.

1511
01:00:10,520 --> 01:00:11,520
I'm Justin McElroy.

1512
01:00:11,520 --> 01:00:12,520
I'm Travis McElroy.

1513
01:00:12,520 --> 01:00:13,520
I'm Griffin McElroy.

1514
01:00:13,520 --> 01:00:14,520
This is with my brother, my brother and me.

1515
01:00:14,520 --> 01:00:15,520
Kiss your dad.

1516
01:00:15,520 --> 01:00:35,000
Square on the lips.

1517
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:37,000
And just want to add one more reminder.

1518
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:38,800

1526
01:00:56,480 --> 01:01:00,600
Do you think it's okay to finish someone else's food?

1527
01:01:00,600 --> 01:01:03,920
Do you have a fight with your friend over whether or not he should wear his Phillies

1528
01:01:03,920 --> 01:01:07,040
garb to a Colorado Rockies game?

1529
01:01:07,040 --> 01:01:11,040
Does your wife want to keep a chamber pot in her art studio?

1530
01:01:11,040 --> 01:01:14,360
If so, please do not write in to Judge John Hodgman.

1531
01:01:14,360 --> 01:01:16,720
I heard all those cases already.

1532
01:01:16,720 --> 01:01:21,620
Judge John Hodgman is the show where I, John Hodgman, adjudicate disputes between real

1533

people calling in over the internet and I tell them who is right and who is wrong over

1534
01:01:26,720 --> 01:01:32,600
such important issues as is a machine gun a robot and is it okay to go through the garbage

1535
01:01:32,600 --> 01:01:35,360
at the Canadian house of pizza and garbage?

1536
01:01:35,360 --> 01:01:42,640
Fail if Jesse Thorn rounds out the cast for a fun-filled podcast of judgment and justice.

1537
01:01:42,640 --> 01:01:44,740
Kind of two of the same thing, actually.

1538
01:01:44,740 --> 01:01:48,000
Judge John Hodgman, take a listen if you do not mind.

1539
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:49,320
I order it.

1540
01:01:49,320 --> 01:01:50,320
Come visit the courtroom.

1541
01:01:50,320 --> 01:02:07,440
