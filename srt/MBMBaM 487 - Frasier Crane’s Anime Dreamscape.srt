1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:30,640
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:48,080
Hello, everybody, and welcome to my brother, my brother, me, and advice show from the modern

6
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:52,480
era. I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy. I'm your middlest brother, Travis McElroy.

7
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:58,880
I'm your sweet baby brother, Griffin McElroy. I believe that children know our future.

8
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:05,680
Okay. Teach them well and let them lead the way. Hi, it's local inspiration, Justin McElroy.

9
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:13,760
Oh, wow. I am here sort of as a podcaster, but now I feel like I've entered my twilight years

10
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:19,840
as an entertainer and have now transitioned to sort of a Sherpa.

11
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:21,200
A guiding light.

12
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:25,280
A guiding light, a Sherpa through these waters that we call podcasts.

13
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:27,840
You know Sherpas don't lead people through water, right?

14
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:30,000
Like they can. I'm a water Sherpa.

15
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:35,440
Okay. If Jimmy Buffett can make a beer called Land Shark, I can make a water Sherpa.

16
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:41,280
Okay. I am joined in the studio today by a young-

17
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:43,120
Don't say his name. He ain't ready for that heat.

18
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:50,240
A young boy, a young local teen who I've taken in off the streets to shadow me and see how-

19
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:53,520
Now, please don't say it like that. If you say you brought him in from the street,

20
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:57,440
it makes it sound like almost an Oliver. Did he seek you out or did he-

21
00:01:57,440 --> 00:02:04,160
I gave him my address and he came in from the street through the front door to the house.

22
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:04,560
Right.

23
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:11,200
But you didn't like find him, you know, filching handkerchiefs or whatever

24
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:12,960
and you're giving him a better life.

25
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:20,000
No, I saw him trying to sell people his underwear and I said, kid, you got something.

26
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,320
You got the gift. You got the talent.

27
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:26,800
Did his parents suddenly and tragically die in a big acrobat accident?

28
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:31,840
And now you are the one, now he's your ward. It's one of those situations.

29
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:36,880
Yes. They died in a tragic acrobat accident. And then what he said was,

30
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:44,960
Mr. McRoy, if my parents had been able to fall on the most comfortable hybrid mattresses on the

31
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:51,760
market, they would have been fine. And I said, kid, you got it. You got the goods.

32
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:54,560
You can't teach that, Justin.

33
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:56,320
No, no.

34
00:02:56,320 --> 00:03:02,320
It's good stuff. I've got somebody in the studio too that's shadowing me doing,

35
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:08,000
and he's learning and I'm an inspiration guiding light. I'm like a fire Sherpa.

36
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:09,680
It's sort of mine.

37
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:10,160
Wow.

38
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:14,560
It's Jake. His name is Jake Gyllenhaal.

39
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:15,760
Oh, wow.

40
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:20,240
Yeah, he's going to play a movie. He's doing a movie about a podcaster.

41
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:22,640
Griffin, Inc.

42
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:27,680
He's doing Griffin, Inc. this time. And his job's not like the other parents' jobs.

43
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:32,720
And so he's watching me. And what's that, Jake?

44
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:37,440
Yeah. Okay. Hey, yeah. If you want, there's, yeah, go grab a,

45
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:39,760
there's some Sobe Life Water down in the fridge. Okay.

46
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:40,720
I'm disappointed in you guys.

47
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:46,800
Can I just real quick, real quick, real quick. I can't fucking stand this guy. He's so big.

48
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:50,240
He's like so animated. And it's like, just come back.

49
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:54,080
Yeah. The cranberry, save the cranberry one for Rachel. Okay.

50
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:57,920
He was like, I'm Spider-Man now. I'm Spider-Man now.

51
00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:01,760
And I'm like, you were in Spider-Man. You didn't play Spider-Man.

52
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:07,360
I am. I also have, well, a shadowing situation happening here.

53
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:13,040
But unlike you two lazy layabouts, I have the entire-

54
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:14,640
Two pieces of gum in my pocket.

55
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:23,200
Well, I have the entire 2019 slash 2020 Harvard Business graduating class shadowing me.

56
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:24,080
Oh, wow.

57
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:26,080
Yeah, they're all here in my office.

58
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:28,880
That must be one hell of a headphone splitter you've got for them.

59
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:33,200
Yeah. Well, I mean, they're all just being very quiet.

60
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:36,640
And they're sharing one speaker that they're huddled around.

61
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:40,960
Like that scene, you know, in Chrissy's story, where they're listening to Little Orphan Annie.

62
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:41,440
Right, sure.

63
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:44,000
They're doing that. It's like they're listening to my brother, my brother, and me.

64
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,200
And they're all in the room, but they promise to be really quiet.

65
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:51,680
Trav, Jake's laughing so hard. Jake Gyllenhaal's really busting a gut on this one.

66
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:53,040
Why would he be laughing?

67
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:56,320
Ian, I'm muted for a second, so I wouldn't mess up the recording.

68
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:58,480
Did you see how I found the pieces of gum in my pocket,

69
00:04:58,480 --> 00:05:00,480
but I didn't make a big deal out of it on the show?

70
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:01,440
That's really important.

71
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:04,560
None of them are talking.

72
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:06,880
Good one, guys.

73
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:08,880
Yeah, absolutely.

74
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:13,840
Anyway, I've just found two pieces of gum randomly.

75
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:15,040
But I didn't make a big deal out of it.

76
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:16,640
Now, here's the thing, folks at home.

77
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:19,920
One of us is telling the truth, and the other two are fibbing.

78
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:23,760
But you'll never know which one it is, right?

79
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:28,720
That's how we keep the spark alive here at my brother, my brother, and me.

80
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:31,200
I'm nodding at the entire Harvard business class.

81
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:32,800
That's how we keep the spark alive.

82
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:33,360
Two truths and a lie.

83
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:37,360
Yeah, we keep people interested, because we lie to them two-thirds of the time,

84
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:40,400
and they never know what is the truth and what's a lie.

85
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:41,600
We don't have more so...

86
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:43,360
How did you finish that that fast?

87
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:45,120
We don't have more Sobey Life water.

88
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:46,800
Griffin, send them over here.

89
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:47,360
I have more.

90
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:47,920
Just send them to the store.

91
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:49,280
Go to Travis's.

92
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:50,480
Fly to Cincinnati.

93
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:53,460
Slam.

94
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:55,840
Slam.

95
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:57,040
Hey, Jake.

96
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,360
Yeah, you wanted some more...

97
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:00,160
No, sorry.

98
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:00,960
He forgot his keys.

99
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:01,760
Send him back, Trav.

100
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:03,280
Okay, you got to go back and get your keys.

101
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:05,060
Slam.

102
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:07,520
Slam.

103
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:08,480
Hey, let's do a question.

104
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,280
Yeah, guys, absolutely.

105
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:12,480
Absolutely.

106
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:15,440
Time for the first question of the episode.

107
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:18,320
I recently moved nearby a donut shop.

108
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:19,600
Oh, that'd be tough.

109
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:21,440
I used to live next door to a Giovanni's.

110
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:22,560
Okay.

111
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:25,760
And I would order garlic bread for every meal.

112
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:30,720
And then sometimes I would also get stromboli or stromboboli and get doubles.

113
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:33,840
So I would have a stromboboli dinner and a stromboboli lunch.

114
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:39,280
Did you collect sort of your sweat during that era to use as a sort of

115
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:43,120
a general purpose, like, Italian oil dressing seasoning?

116
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:45,120
Yeah, bechamel, almost.

117
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:47,760
So the donuts are highly praised in the area.

118
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:49,280
However, I looked at the reviews.

119
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:54,160
70% of them talk about how the old man that runs the shop is a huge bully to his customers.

120
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:59,440
Many reviews even stated how he refused to sell you his donuts if you weren't interested in the daily specials.

121
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:03,360
Or he puts extra donuts in your bag and charges you for them whether or not you wanted them.

122
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:08,080
My social anxiety has peaked at the thought of interacting with this man, but I really want to try his donuts.

123
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:10,080
Brothers, what do I do?

124
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:16,640
That's from Scared of the Donut Man in St. Paul, Minnesota.

125
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:17,440
That's what I said.

126
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:22,880
I have good news and bad news, and they're both the same news.

127
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:24,080
Okay.

128
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:26,640
Because you're gonna need to go get these donuts.

129
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:28,080
That's the bad news.

130
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:28,720
Absolutely.

131
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:29,920
We've got no premise.

132
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:34,320
Yes, because the good news side of this is these donuts are so good

133
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:42,240
that this business has been able to stay in business even though it sounds like it's owned by a bad business person.

134
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:42,960
Yeah.

135
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:43,440
Right?

136
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:45,520
That's how good these donuts are.

137
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:51,280
And you find that out sometimes where it's like, oh, yeah, this is like a deli where if you don't know what you want right away, they yell at you.

138
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:51,840
Right.

139
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:59,200
But people still go there and they'll say, oh, I go there for the atmosphere and it's fun because, like, the hairdressers are rude to you or whatever.

140
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:00,160
But that's what I-

141
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:01,680
Let's not skip over that, Travis.

142
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:03,840
I want to explore this Dick's Last Resort.

143
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:10,400
He, that this cantankerous old donut man is spinning on his customers because there are people who like that.

144
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:20,000
And I feel like you can do like a really mean punk rock donut shop atmo and people are gonna be wicked into it.

145
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,440
Like just a general sort of, I know what you're gonna do with these.

146
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:27,760
You gotta, I know what you're gonna do with these holes.

147
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:29,120
Aren't you?

148
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:29,440
Oh, yeah.

149
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:31,200
You dirty, you dirty animal.

150
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:31,840
It's not me.

151
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:33,280
This is the character I'm playing.

152
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:34,080
This is the character.

153
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:38,640
Of the filthy old donut man who is gonna be mean to you.

154
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:41,200
But then if you call him on it, he's like, you know what?

155
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:44,640
Take some, take some crullers for the kids.

156
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:46,640
Oh, that's a good point.

157
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:48,480
Does he like the back sass?

158
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:51,120
Is he looking for like a two way sassy exchange?

159
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:53,440
Hey, fuck you too, old man.

160
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:53,920
Well, that's not-

161
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:55,440
Whoa, that's so mean.

162
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:56,480
That's too mean.

163
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:58,560
Take some crullers for the kids.

164
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:01,280
He's like, hey, wait, you gotta pay.

165
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:04,480
I'll pay, you pay for my balls and then leave.

166
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:04,960
Whoa, that's illegal.

167
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:05,680
Without paying.

168
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:09,760
Hey, your balls are illegal and then you leave.

169
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:12,320
Well, how did you, oh, you knew the secret code.

170
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:15,680
These donuts are on the house and these nuts.

171
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:18,960
Say, are these donuts hot?

172
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:22,640
And when he says no, up in the bag and say you're not paying for them.

173
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:23,680
Make some fresh ones.

174
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:25,680
That's good.

175
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:30,960
He's really mean and you're like, hey, I know that behind that gruff donut mean exterior,

176
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:32,480
you're just looking to be loved.

177
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:34,640
And I want you to know you can't scare me off.

178
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:36,720
I'll be back tomorrow for more donuts.

179
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:40,080
And then you do that every day until eventually you're in.

180
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:43,440
You fall in love, he teaches you how to do the donuts.

181
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:47,200
I've never read Tuesdays with Maury, but I think this is what happens at first.

182
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:49,280
Maury is so fucking mean.

183
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:50,720
He's like, hey, you piece of shit.

184
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:52,880
I don't want to spend Tuesdays with you.

185
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:54,400
Yeah, Tuesdays are my day.

186
00:09:54,400 --> 00:10:02,320
I want to briefly talk about donuts in Huntington, because we got a bunch of people coming into Huntington.

187
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:02,800
Okay.

188
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:11,040
I would, I just want to remind everybody that the best option for donuts in the area is Jolly Pirate Donuts.

189
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:11,600
Correct.

190
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:14,560
The donut box looks like a treasure chest.

191
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:15,360
Can't beat it.

192
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,160
Ask if they got hot donuts in the back.

193
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:22,160
If they don't mention it, like up front, you'll be able to find some.

194
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:28,880
Also, I would 100% recommend that you follow Jolly Pirate on Facebook, because it's fucking radical.

195
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:29,440
Oh, what are they putting out?

196
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:34,880
I think it's like one old old man who doesn't fully grok Facebook, but he's crushing it.

197
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:37,920
It's just, there's a picture that went up.

198
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:40,000
So they haven't posted for literally two months.

199
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:47,040
Yesterday, he put up two pictures of donuts in the fryer with the quote.

200
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:48,320
What?

201
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:50,080
There's two pictures of donuts in the fryer.

202
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:51,360
I'm looking at it now.

203
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:52,800
It's unbelievable.

204
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:54,400
Can you read that quote for me, Griff?

205
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:59,120
The quote said, these are, first of all, not especially well-framed photos of these donuts,

206
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:07,040
but it says, no baby beats the old man, but beats his B-E-T-S, like the vegetable.

207
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:07,540
What?

208
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:10,320
No baby beats the old man.

209
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:12,480
That's what Jolly Pirate's message is.

210
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:13,680
I don't know.

211
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:17,280
It's like they're, I guess they're calling out someone.

212
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:18,560
I don't know who.

213
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:25,360
Somebody post like a rival donut place, post a picture of one donut in a fryer,

214
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:27,120
and they're like, fuck that, we're doing two.

215
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:35,520
Possible messages for this are one, there's tiny donuts at Peace Love and Little Donuts downtown.

216
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:39,040
Those are not great.

217
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:43,680
And then there's, we got a Dunkin, our first Dunkin in town.

218
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:44,080
What?

219
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:46,240
And maybe they're making a run at Dunkin.

220
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:47,040
I don't know.

221
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:47,840
Oh, I see.

222
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:52,400
Listen, I like Dunkin, and I don't know about Jolly Pirate's coffee scenario.

223
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:54,320
Like Dunkin.

224
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:56,160
Don't, don't, shop local.

225
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:57,600
Is it possible?

226
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:59,920
It don't be Jolly Pirate donuts.

227
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:01,440
Dunkin's donuts are unthinkable.

228
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:05,120
The idea, do you know why they had, do you know how they legally had to change the name

229
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:06,400
of the place just to Dunkin?

230
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:10,240
Because they're not even, they don't even qualify as donuts anymore.

231
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:12,240
They don't like legally, it's like a legal-

232
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:14,000
They're just called breaded rings.

233
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,600
If I could flow, is it possible-

234
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:18,240
That's how Pringles are like potato crisps.

235
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:18,480
Yeah.

236
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:24,400
Is it possible that the social media manager for Jolly Pirate Donuts did an extremely questionable

237
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:25,920
job of quoting Dirty Dancing?

238
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:29,520
How about a Yahoo?

239
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:30,560
It's like I always say.

240
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:34,000
No baby beats the old man.

241
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,160
Nobody puts baby at the intersection.

242
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,360
Okay, so here's a Yahoo.

243
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:42,720
This one was sent in by, actually a few people sent this one in.

244
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:44,160
It's by an anonymous Yahoo Answers user.

245
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:47,440
Oh wait, sorry, I just want to circle back to one thing.

246
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:52,880
The last post from Jolly Pirate Donuts is a picture of a huge cruise ship going through

247
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:54,080
a canal in Greece.

248
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:56,080
Oh, fucking the best.

249
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:56,640
Yeah, man.

250
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:58,400
Oh, that's so cool.

251
00:12:58,400 --> 00:13:00,000
Pumpkin cookies now available.

252
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:00,640
That's something else.

253
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:03,600
This is a good, this is a premium follow, folks.

254
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:04,880
This is a premium follow.

255
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:07,600
Damn, we haven't recommended a premium follow in a while.

256
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:08,720
You know I'm getting on board.

257
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:09,200
I'm following-

258
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:11,920
Jolly Pirates WV on Facebook.

259
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:17,520
Okay, so anyway, this one sent in by no baby.

260
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:19,680
I can't stop thinking about no baby beats the old man.

261
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:20,160
It's got like-

262
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:20,720
No baby.

263
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:21,840
No baby beats the old man.

264
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:22,960
It's got such good-

265
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:25,920
Until the chosen baby.

266
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:30,560
It's got pure boomer energy in a way that I wish everything kind of reflected.

267
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:36,880
But anyway, so no baby asks, Fraser and Niles get caught eating baked beans at the opera.

268
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:42,400
I am an aspiring screenwriter, and it is my dream to work on the new Fraser reboot.

269
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:44,000
Would this be a good episode idea?

270
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:52,560
We've all been waiting for this opportunity to fall in, not our laps, but someone's laps,

271
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:58,720
so that we can run over, slap it out of their lap, and onto our lap, and make it our Fraser reboot.

272
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:04,720
But this idea of Fraser and Niles get caught eating baked beans at the opera,

273
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:09,520
I feel like we could think and think our three brains locked it together,

274
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:16,000
completing the cerebral puzzle as it were, and we would not come up with anything that good.

275
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,480
But I'm, you know, I'm open to suggestions, I guess.

276
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:21,520
Here's-

277
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:22,080
Okay.

278
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:27,280
Here's what, to catch you guys up while you think about your answers,

279
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:29,840
I want to, what's the latest on the Fraser reboot?

280
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:32,960
This is the Fraser reboot watch, which is a new segment.

281
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:37,840
This is from 10 days ago.

282
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:43,360
While visiting in depth with Graham Bessinger last week,

283
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:47,520
Grammer said that while no network has taken in the cranes just yet,

284
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:50,720
he approved of an idea for the new season.

285
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:51,840
This is from Vulture.

286
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:54,240
And this is Kelsey, this is Kelsey Grammer speaking.

287
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:56,880
This is Kelsey Grammer of Fraser fame.

288
00:14:56,880 --> 00:15:01,280
He played the, one of the main big characters on there, Fraser.

289
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:02,960
The titular Fraser.

290
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:04,560
He played Fraser.

291
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:06,560
Okay, so here's the quote.

292
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:08,160
We got it hatched.

293
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:09,680
We've hatched the plan.

294
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:12,800
What we think is the right way to go.

295
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:16,000
We're sort of on standby a little bit.

296
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:18,800
Hey, where's my Bim Bam season two?

297
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:20,960
We hatched it.

298
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:21,920
We hatched it.

299
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:22,720
We hatched the plan.

300
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:23,920
It's a holding pattern.

301
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:26,960
But you know how like you hatch a baby and then like a baby bird,

302
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:29,520
and then the baby bird is just on standby for a while?

303
00:15:29,520 --> 00:15:30,240
Don't worry about it.

304
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:32,800
Here's, we're kind of on standby for a little bit.

305
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:34,320
And this is another one that we can steal.

306
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:38,400
Working out a couple of possible network deals that we're circling.

307
00:15:39,280 --> 00:15:44,240
So we're kind of, there's the deals below us and like the majestic hawk.

308
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:46,560
We are circling the deals.

309
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:49,520
So we just hatched the hawk and it's also circling.

310
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:50,080
Don't let that confuse you.

311
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:53,600
We've hatched the hawk of deals and it's circling the deals.

312
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:55,040
And let's dive back into this quote.

313
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:56,400
Just like a hawk.

314
00:15:56,400 --> 00:16:00,480
There's still stuff going on, but a revisit to Frasier, comma,

315
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:04,000
Frasier's world is, I think, definitely going to come.

316
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:08,560
Now, Vulture has taken a step here to not italicize Frasier's world,

317
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:14,880
which seems strange because I do think that when Kelsey Grammer said that,

318
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:21,040
he was dropping the world premiere name of the reboot Frasier's world.

319
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:24,000
It'll be Frasier's world.

320
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:27,040
And at this point, you get to go inside of his mindscape.

321
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:31,760
And so it's part animated, by which I mean like anime.

322
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:33,200
It's all anime in there.

323
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:35,840
Like inside Frasier's head?

324
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:36,960
Yeah, in his mind.

325
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:38,640
Because he's always talking about other people's minds.

326
00:16:38,640 --> 00:16:42,400
In this one, you get to go into Frasier's world, which is what he calls his anime.

327
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:44,800
In this one, Frasier has been in some kind of accident.

328
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:46,240
Maybe he's in a coma.

329
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:49,360
And we're getting to see the dreamscape in which Frasier lives.

330
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:49,840
I get it.

331
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:51,280
Okay, yeah, that's obvious.

332
00:16:51,280 --> 00:16:53,600
We find out the entire first series was a dream

333
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:55,440
because Kelsey Grammer hates the first series.

334
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:56,800
So he wants to undo it.

335
00:16:56,800 --> 00:17:01,920
He always wanted it to be based around Frasier Crane's anime dreamscape.

336
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:02,420
Yes.

337
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:06,320
John Mahoney hologram.

338
00:17:06,320 --> 00:17:10,400
So Frasier and Niles are eating some beans at the opera.

339
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:11,520
Baked beans.

340
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:12,080
Baked beans.

341
00:17:12,080 --> 00:17:14,640
Not a fancy bean like a garbanzo.

342
00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:16,800
And what I love about this,

343
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:19,600
this premise that this aspiring screenwriter has set up,

344
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:23,600
is the issue is not that they are eating baked beans at the opera.

345
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:26,000
It's that they're caught eating baked beans at the opera.

346
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,120
They fucked up.

347
00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:27,840
Yeah.

348
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:29,360
Now, so here's the question.

349
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:30,640
Let's roll back.

350
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:32,320
How did we get here?

351
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:34,560
Maybe we start in media rows.

352
00:17:34,560 --> 00:17:36,320
The first thing, they're caught.

353
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:37,040
Break the story.

354
00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:38,880
Right, they're caught, right?

355
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:41,600
Hey, there's a flashlight from an usher.

356
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:43,840
Maybe the usher is like a young person.

357
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:45,680
So their voice breaks when they say like,

358
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:50,480
Mr. Crane, no baked beans at the opera for the last time.

359
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:53,760
And then we just see them on the floor eating loose baked beans.

360
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:57,600
And now we then start back at the beginning to get there.

361
00:17:57,600 --> 00:18:02,480
So this is the premiere of Frasier's World.

362
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:04,080
This is the first episode.

363
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:08,240
You haven't seen Kelsey in a couple decades,

364
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:10,480
except for that one very viral video

365
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:12,320
where he did eat shit off the stage.

366
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:13,760
Yes, other than that though.

367
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:16,240
We all remember that and love that.

368
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:18,240
That was practically a Frasier reboot.

369
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:21,040
A very, very short, very, very small, very delightful.

370
00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:23,360
Frasier's plummet to the ground.

371
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:25,840
And he's come back.

372
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:28,320
So after the in media res opening,

373
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:33,520
we show him and they are mourning the loss of the chair,

374
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:34,560
which is fucked up.

375
00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:35,760
The chair is gone.

376
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:38,480
And so, and the dad wanted the chair to be,

377
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:42,320
you know, what's the word?

378
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:44,080
Immolated, disintegrated.

379
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:45,360
What's the word I'm looking for?

380
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:48,160
Yeah, I think it's evaporated.

381
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:49,840
And he was like, and don't worry about it.

382
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:52,560
Just put it in a can of baked beans.

383
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:53,920
Okay.

384
00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:55,680
So he doesn't want like a fancy urn

385
00:18:55,680 --> 00:18:57,280
because he's not a fancy person

386
00:18:57,280 --> 00:18:59,840
like old Garbanzo Niles over here.

387
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:00,340
Yes.

388
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:03,760
Is Niles and Frasier eating their dad?

389
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:07,280
No, but they gotta get the can from somewhere.

390
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:10,480
Well, yeah, I'm saying that, oh, so they need the can.

391
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:12,240
I thought you were saying Griffin,

392
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:13,360
because where I was going to go with it

393
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:15,600
is they put the ashes of the chair

394
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:17,360
into the can of baked beans.

395
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:20,240
Oh, and then it like made a,

396
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:22,000
like a chair slurry, Travis?

397
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,240
Yes, but then the baked beans spill,

398
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:26,480
while the can maybe gets destroyed.

399
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:26,800
Okay.

400
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:29,200
And now they need to get the baked beans out of there.

401
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:30,800
And the only way they can think to do it

402
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:32,960
is by smuggling in their tum-tums.

403
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:33,600
That's cool.

404
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:37,360
Frasier's like some dumb old, it's old.

405
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:39,360
Hey, Justin, you're not muted.

406
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:40,880
I pretend to like it for my brothers,

407
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:42,240
because they're like old and boring,

408
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:45,680
but hey, did Frasier end with Roz and Frasier getting together?

409
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:46,560
Because that's what I want.

410
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,120
Absolutely, Trav.

411
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:49,600
Okay, cool.

412
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:50,800
Do you think they're going to be back?

413
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:52,640
It's weird, just you keep cutting out,

414
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:55,120
and then you come back in yelling absolutely,

415
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:57,920
but not sort of responding to the thing that the people said.

416
00:19:58,560 --> 00:20:02,320
I'm just bringing like positive energy to the show,

417
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:03,280
trying to keep it going, you know?

418
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:04,160
Yeah, for sure.

419
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:06,320
So anyway, what I've just done

420
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:08,720
is in Hollywood terms called a bump.

421
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:10,800
And I'm looking for, Travis has said it,

422
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:12,320
so Justin, you go ahead and spike it

423
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:13,600
right across the net line.

424
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:18,240
We've established the sort of baked beans narrative.

425
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:18,960
Yes.

426
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:19,600
Take us home.

427
00:20:20,560 --> 00:20:24,880
Okay, so they need, what are they still lacking?

428
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:26,320
A can, right?

429
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:28,720
We've got the can, nope, we've got the can.

430
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:30,000
They were caught eating it.

431
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
You got caught eating it, finish it.

432
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,320
We're at the opera, they have the can,

433
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:36,480
they've spilled the can, they're eating it off the floor.

434
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:38,480
Okay, the problem is-

435
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:40,160
Why are they eating it at the opera?

436
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:42,160
They're eating dirty chair chili off,

437
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:44,800
because they were gonna go throw it over the big cliff

438
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:46,560
like their dad asked to scatter the chair.

439
00:20:46,560 --> 00:20:48,080
But then they saw that the opera was in town.

440
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:50,640
But then they saw the, and like a moth to a flame,

441
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:52,720
these two fancy fucks went to the opera.

442
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:55,280
And they said, we can throw it after the fancy opera.

443
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:55,840
But what happened?

444
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:57,120
They spilled it on the floor

445
00:20:57,120 --> 00:20:59,680
and they have to eat the chair chili off the fucking floor

446
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:00,560
like a couple of dogs.

447
00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:02,560
Oh shit, okay, listen, are you guys ready?

448
00:21:02,560 --> 00:21:03,520
I'm about to pitch you what-

449
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:05,440
Travis, Justin needs to spike it.

450
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:06,880
Okay, yes, you spike it Griffin,

451
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:10,880
and then I will sell it in the room, the Frasier reboot.

452
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:16,320
So B-plot, Daphne is-

453
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:17,120
Oh, she's back.

454
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:19,840
She's back, but here's the thing,

455
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:22,480
she runs a company now.

456
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:22,980
Okay.

457
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:25,680
And she's incorporating.

458
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:28,880
In this episode, she's filing the papers to incorporate.

459
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:29,380
Okay.

460
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:31,360
So back to you, Travis.

461
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:33,520
Okay, I don't see how that helps me resolve-

462
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:37,040
Oh, maybe her business is she now runs

463
00:21:37,040 --> 00:21:41,040
like a huge cleaning service organization

464
00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:43,600
that now she is the head of

465
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:47,120
and now she gets the contract to clean the bean mess.

466
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:48,000
And they don't want-

467
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:50,560
The opera-

468
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:52,800
I can't find a name for me company.

469
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:54,720
Wait a minute, I'll get it.

470
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:58,000
Empty can of baked beans, LLC.

471
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,000
And they all tie back together.

472
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,440
It all ties back.

473
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:02,320
Now, are you ready?

474
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:04,720
Here's how I'm going to, if you're listening, Kelsey Grammer,

475
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:08,160
which I know you are, you dirty boy.

476
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:11,120
Okay, here, I'm gonna give you your pitch.

477
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:12,800
Mr. Grammer, this is such an honor.

478
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:13,280
Oh my God.

479
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:14,560
Yeah, thank you for listening.

480
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:16,800
I listened to your autobiography,

481
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:19,120
the audio book version of it.

482
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:19,920
Grammer Crackers?

483
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:22,080
So far, no.

484
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:22,580
Okay.

485
00:22:23,040 --> 00:22:23,680
In this one-

486
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:26,240
It was Country Grammer was the name of it.

487
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:26,720
Country Grammer.

488
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:29,920
Goes written by Nelly.

489
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:31,760
It's actually Grammer's Cool.

490
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:32,560
Grammer's Cool.

491
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:36,880
In this one, rather than the dad coming to live

492
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:40,320
with Kelsey Grammer, AKA Frasier, right?

493
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:42,160
And him being the fish out of water.

494
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:44,400
This one, Frasier goes to live with his dad

495
00:22:45,040 --> 00:22:48,320
in a rural town where Frasier just doesn't fit in.

496
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:50,800
John Mahoney did sadly pass away.

497
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:51,120
So I don't-

498
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:52,000
Remember we talked about-

499
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,200
It's a reboot, Griffin.

500
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:54,560
It's gonna be different now.

501
00:22:54,560 --> 00:22:56,560
We already talked about John Mahoney hologram.

502
00:22:57,600 --> 00:22:58,080
Yeah, that's established.

503
00:22:58,080 --> 00:23:00,240
It's problematic in a few ways.

504
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:02,160
I would love to come into this one clean.

505
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:03,360
I would love to come into this one clean.

506
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:05,600
In this one, Kelsey Grammer plays the dad.

507
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:09,440
Okay, now we're on some Honey Boy shit

508
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:11,040
and I'm back fucking on board.

509
00:23:11,040 --> 00:23:16,560
We got a young, fancy person to play the titular Frasier.

510
00:23:16,560 --> 00:23:18,800
Everybody bumps up one character.

511
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:20,160
Everyone bumps up one character.

512
00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:22,320
And who comes in at the bottom to play Frasier?

513
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:23,840
It's young Sheldon.

514
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:26,240
Not the actor that plays young Sheldon.

515
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:29,360
It's young motherfucking Sheldon comes in.

516
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:31,520
ABC, CBS, NBC.

517
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:33,680
Okay, I'm sorry.

518
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:36,080
I have to quibble with you.

519
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:39,920
Young Sheldon would have to come in to play the dog Eddie

520
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:43,600
in the hopes that something would be loosened up

521
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:44,800
at some point.

522
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:46,880
And then he would be in the running after that

523
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:51,200
to take over Niles because it funnels by age, right?

524
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:51,760
Right.

525
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:54,800
So you're saying David Hyde Pierce would play Frasier?

526
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:55,760
And Eddie the dog would play Niles?

527
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:57,200
David Hyde Pierce would be Frasier.

528
00:23:57,200 --> 00:23:57,760
That's right.

529
00:23:57,760 --> 00:23:58,240
Okay.

530
00:23:58,240 --> 00:23:59,440
Yes.

531
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:00,720
Well, okay, sorry.

532
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:02,000
Roz would have to play Niles

533
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,240
because I think Roz is probably above Eddie the dog.

534
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:06,320
Just on the call list.

535
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:07,760
Let's keep shaking the tree, guys.

536
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:08,800
That is how it works.

537
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:11,040
That's how it worked on Roseanne when she got booted.

538
00:24:11,040 --> 00:24:14,240
Lori Metcalf was like, now I'm, it's called Metcalf now.

539
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:16,000
Welcome to Metcalf.

540
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:16,720
You know what sucks?

541
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:18,480
And why I've been actually distracted is

542
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:23,600
I can't stop thinking about how terrifyingly close

543
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:28,240
the last 10 minutes probably actually really were

544
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:31,120
to some of the breaking of stories for Frasier,

545
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:32,880
especially towards the end.

546
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:35,360
I feel like if you swapped out baked beans

547
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:36,560
with another proper now,

548
00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:40,000
we probably would have gotten to a solid spec.

549
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:41,520
There was probably a lot of pitch meetings

550
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:44,320
that were just like, Frasier's in Vegas.

551
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:46,880
Okay, you got 48 hours to give me 20 pages.

552
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:48,480
That was it.

553
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:51,360
Hey guys, I got a segment I want to do.

554
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:53,280
Oh yeah, set it up, Trav.

555
00:24:53,280 --> 00:24:56,320
So I tried this segment out in Milwaukee.

556
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:56,800
I loved it.

557
00:24:56,800 --> 00:24:58,080
I'm going to do it again.

558
00:24:58,080 --> 00:25:03,200
Basically, I call it reach for the stars.

559
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:05,120
And in it, I'm going to read you guys

560
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:06,560
a couple of Amazon reviews

561
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:09,920
and I'll give you like the review and the star rating.

562
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:11,280
And you guys are going to try to guess

563
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,320
what the product they're reviewing is.

564
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:17,360
Now this first one here,

565
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:19,680
this is a one out of five star review.

566
00:25:19,680 --> 00:25:20,160
Oh no.

567
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:22,800
It may have just been a warehouse issue,

568
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:25,360
but there was nothing inside the package.

569
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:26,880
It was a white and blue envelope

570
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:28,640
and there was nothing in it.

571
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:30,480
It was even sealed as well.

572
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:31,920
Would not recommend.

573
00:25:31,920 --> 00:25:33,280
It even had tracking,

574
00:25:33,280 --> 00:25:35,280
but there was nothing inside.

575
00:25:35,280 --> 00:25:37,840
Someone had to seal the package at the West house

576
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:39,920
knowing there was nothing inside.

577
00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:42,880
This is an anti-clue you have given us.

578
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:46,720
I know less about the product now

579
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:47,840
than I did when we started.

580
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:49,840
Let me give you one piece of information here.

581
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:50,080
Okay.

582
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:53,520
This is another one out of five star review.

583
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:53,920
Toy.

584
00:25:55,040 --> 00:25:55,520
Okay.

585
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:57,360
So I, cause I was going to say aphids.

586
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:00,320
Oh, not a bad guess.

587
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:00,880
I mean, it is a bad guess.

588
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:03,680
You open up the bag and aphids come out

589
00:26:03,680 --> 00:26:04,560
and you don't even see them.

590
00:26:04,560 --> 00:26:06,080
You're like, this bag was empty,

591
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:07,440
but really there was the aphids

592
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:08,640
you bought and forgot about.

593
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:09,200
That's pretty good.

594
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:10,480
But if it's a toy.

595
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:12,240
Toy.

596
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:13,920
Now remember that's a one star review.

597
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:17,120
Oh, so it's, they didn't want it to be a toy.

598
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:19,120
They wanted it to be a business.

599
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:21,280
Highlander replica sword.

600
00:26:21,280 --> 00:26:22,320
Highlander replica sword.

601
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:23,600
Good guess, good guess.

602
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:26,720
What about like a, you know, a funny stapler,

603
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:30,000
like a office space theme stapler, you know?

604
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:30,480
Okay.

605
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:32,240
Something businessy, not a toy.

606
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:34,000
One of you is on the right track.

607
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:34,800
And I won't tell you what,

608
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:36,480
but one of you is on the right track.

609
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:38,480
Now this is a five out of five star review

610
00:26:39,280 --> 00:26:40,400
and this might help a lot.

611
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:42,880
Very realistic looking.

612
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:45,040
They fool most people.

613
00:26:45,040 --> 00:26:46,880
Made of good quality materials.

614
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:47,920
Awesome price.

615
00:26:47,920 --> 00:26:49,760
And most important, fun.

616
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:52,480
I've changed my answer significantly

617
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:54,640
because now I think it's full blown shit.

618
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:57,760
I think it's a full blown, goofy, goofy, rubbery shit

619
00:26:57,760 --> 00:26:59,440
that you would put on the floor of your house.

620
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:00,880
So your friends walk in and be like,

621
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:03,360
why is there shit on the floor?

622
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:04,480
And you're like, it's a joke.

623
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:06,480
And then they say, why did you want us to think

624
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:07,760
there was shit on the floor?

625
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:08,320
One of those.

626
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:09,280
Okay.

627
00:27:09,280 --> 00:27:12,000
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle replica nunchucks.

628
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,200
Okay, okay.

629
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:15,280
Now here's the final one.

630
00:27:15,280 --> 00:27:16,320
Five out of five stars.

631
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:19,040
Son got them for drama class.

632
00:27:19,040 --> 00:27:20,400
Very realistic.

633
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:21,600
Teacher impressed.

634
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:24,080
I'm back to aphids.

635
00:27:25,680 --> 00:27:26,880
I'm right back on aphids.

636
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:30,560
Well, how do you think the aphids

637
00:27:30,560 --> 00:27:32,400
would be deployed in drama class?

638
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:34,160
In an impressive way, it sounds like.

639
00:27:34,160 --> 00:27:35,200
It'd be fucking cool, man.

640
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:37,600
If you're doing like a monologue from some play

641
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:39,120
that had aphids in it.

642
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:41,040
Or a monologue from like Bugs Life.

643
00:27:41,040 --> 00:27:44,880
Bugs Life and monologue or from ants would be funny.

644
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:46,880
Um, no, okay, I'm back on sort of,

645
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:49,760
I'm sort of leaning towards Justin's prop weapons now.

646
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:50,960
I'm gonna stick with nunchucks.

647
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:51,920
Oh, nope.

648
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:54,240
We're looking at fake cigarettes.

649
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:55,360
Fake cigarettes.

650
00:27:55,360 --> 00:27:57,120
Fake cigarettes.

651
00:27:57,120 --> 00:28:00,160
Now, I have one more here and I will tell you.

652
00:28:00,160 --> 00:28:02,080
Now wait, can we stop for a second?

653
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:02,320
Uh-huh.

654
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:05,440
Someone thought they were ordering

655
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:07,280
real cigarettes from Amazon.

656
00:28:07,280 --> 00:28:07,680
Toy.

657
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:09,440
Toy.

658
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:14,480
Hey, these didn't, I didn't feel anything with these.

659
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:16,000
This is a toy.

660
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,000
Where's all the cool smoke?

661
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:18,880
Got one more here now.

662
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:19,920
I will go ahead and tell you guys

663
00:28:19,920 --> 00:28:21,920
this is another novelty.

664
00:28:21,920 --> 00:28:22,240
Okay.

665
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:23,520
Uh, cause that will become clear

666
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:26,000
from this first five out of five star review.

667
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:29,840
Yeah, buddy, fooled my whole family at Easter, lol.

668
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:32,960
Fake dookie, fake dookie, fake dookie.

669
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:37,120
I would hate to be one answer off with my fake dookie,

670
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:41,040
but um, uh, yeah, yeah, fake dookie.

671
00:28:41,040 --> 00:28:43,120
I mean, you guys got it and won.

672
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:44,160
Oh wow, really?

673
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:45,440
Yeah, but I'll read the rest of the reviews

674
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:46,800
cause they're very good.

675
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:47,360
Okay, okay.

676
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:49,440
This is a five out of five star review.

677
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:51,840
I was really excited about this variable fools day.

678
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:54,400
Unfortunately, my dog ate it before my husband could see it

679
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:56,480
because he was feeling extra petty that day.

680
00:28:57,360 --> 00:29:00,560
That's extra, that's really bad about your marriage

681
00:29:00,560 --> 00:29:02,960
and your dog ate some shit.

682
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:04,720
That's rough too.

683
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:07,280
This one is a five out of five review titled

684
00:29:07,280 --> 00:29:09,360
the best fake poop on the market.

685
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:11,440
Well, we would have gotten it with that one probably Travis.

686
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:12,800
Yeah, I wouldn't have given you the title,

687
00:29:12,800 --> 00:29:14,960
but I think you probably would have gotten it from this.

688
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:17,520
When I cleaned out my uncle's house after his passing,

689
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:19,840
I offered up various items to the cousins.

690
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:22,640
One of the items was an antique porcelain commode.

691
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:24,480
My one cousin said he wanted it.

692
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:26,320
I packed it up and shipped it off,

693
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:29,200
but of course put one of these in it as a gag.

694
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:32,560
That's a pretty horrible gag I feel like.

695
00:29:32,560 --> 00:29:33,760
It's fucking funny.

696
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:35,760
Okay, now one more and this one.

697
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:39,280
Oh my God, five out of five star reviews here.

698
00:29:39,280 --> 00:29:43,120
Got it from my stocking stuffer, parentheses, from Santa,

699
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:47,520
and parentheses, to myself as a joke for my daughter.

700
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:49,840
Fuck me.

701
00:29:51,680 --> 00:29:52,560
Do it again.

702
00:29:52,560 --> 00:29:56,080
Got it for my stocking stuffer, parentheses, from Santa,

703
00:29:56,080 --> 00:30:00,160
and parentheses, to myself as a joke for my daughter.

704
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:03,520
Later that day, took it to my parents' house

705
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:05,840
and strategically placed it in the hallway

706
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:08,000
right when the party was going

707
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:11,520
and then waited for my dad to notice.

708
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:13,760
Took about two hours, but he noticed.

709
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:17,440
I got the whole party in on it.

710
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:21,360
This guy expectantly staring at this brown lump like,

711
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:23,920
hey, anybody been to the hallway lately?

712
00:30:23,920 --> 00:30:25,200
It's a little stinky in there

713
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:27,600
if anybody wants to go into the hallway.

714
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:29,440
I got the whole party in on it.

715
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:30,800
The look on my dad's face

716
00:30:30,800 --> 00:30:33,040
when he tried to secretly grab the paper towel

717
00:30:33,040 --> 00:30:36,400
and clean it up before anyone noticed was priceless.

718
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:38,640
And the moment when he bent down and grabbed it

719
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:41,200
and realized it was fake was even better.

720
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:43,680
Touch that shit, old man.

721
00:30:43,680 --> 00:30:44,480
Touch it, dad.

722
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:46,080
I've waited two hours for this.

723
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:48,640
The moment's here.

724
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:48,880
How was the party?

725
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:50,160
Hey, has anyone seen Doug?

726
00:30:50,160 --> 00:30:52,240
Yeah, he's just staring down the hallway.

727
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:53,360
Did you have fun at the party?

728
00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:57,440
Yeah, I spent most of it looking at fake shit on the ground.

729
00:30:58,480 --> 00:31:00,720
I know you invited that person that you wanted me to talk to

730
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:03,760
because you think maybe we could become romantically entwined,

731
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:04,880
but they did try and talk to me

732
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:06,400
and I said, not now, not now, not now.

733
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:08,720
I need to watch my daddy touch this poo-poo.

734
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:11,280
And he looked like a fool for the five seconds

735
00:31:11,280 --> 00:31:12,960
when he thought it was real.

736
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:14,080
What a dumb asshole.

737
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:17,600
Hey, I'm not gonna be able to afford any fake poop

738
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:20,080
if we don't take a quick break to the Money Zone.

739
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:35,280
Do you think there was ever a dookie gag of any stripe

740
00:31:35,280 --> 00:31:37,040
on Frasier Prime,

741
00:31:37,040 --> 00:31:38,800
which is what we'll call the first sort of-

742
00:31:38,800 --> 00:31:41,120
They had a dog running around the house

743
00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:42,640
in a fancy apartment.

744
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:44,560
You know there was, Griffin?

745
00:31:44,560 --> 00:31:44,960
Okay.

746
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:46,000
This isn't an ad.

747
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:48,240
Neither of you are doing the ads.

748
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:49,280
Okay, I'll read it here.

749
00:31:49,280 --> 00:31:50,640
This ad is from Stitch Fix.

750
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:54,720
Everybody go to Amazon and buy the complete series of Frasier

751
00:31:55,680 --> 00:31:58,320
and think about how all of them would be wearing

752
00:31:58,320 --> 00:31:59,120
comfortable underpants.

753
00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:00,160
He's right.

754
00:32:00,160 --> 00:32:02,560
It says, Stitch Fix says right here,

755
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:04,160
don't talk about the clothes.

756
00:32:04,160 --> 00:32:06,240
We're warning you, nerdlingers.

757
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:08,800
Just, we went deep.

758
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:12,640
It says we went, okay, we went deep on Frasier.

759
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:14,320
So deep.

760
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:15,520
God, we're ruined.

761
00:32:15,520 --> 00:32:18,720
Why did we spend all the money we used,

762
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:22,800
we earned from bringing great style direct to people's doors

763
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:25,040
with their favorite clothing brands

764
00:32:25,040 --> 00:32:29,120
and shipping out people's boxes of clothes and accessories

765
00:32:29,680 --> 00:32:33,280
and we spent it all on Frasier, baby, and we're sunk.

766
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:35,920
It says here, we invested in Frasier,

767
00:32:35,920 --> 00:32:39,040
which is not a thing we thought you could do with a TV show,

768
00:32:39,040 --> 00:32:42,000
but we thought they were all about stylish, classy people.

769
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,800
So we thought, what better to associate ourselves with?

770
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:47,840
And only then did we find out it's not even running anymore.

771
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:49,600
It says here that to get started,

772
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:51,280
go to stitchfix.com slash my brother,

773
00:32:51,280 --> 00:32:53,280
answer some questions about your preferred style

774
00:32:53,280 --> 00:32:55,040
and your personal shopper will ship you

775
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:57,120
a box of clothes, shoes, and accessories.

776
00:32:57,120 --> 00:33:00,240
And that Griffin on his last box kept five out of five things

777
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:02,800
because they really, really crushed it.

778
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:05,520
And then it says here that they just called the stock market

779
00:33:05,520 --> 00:33:08,720
and started yelling, Frasier, Frasier, Frasier, Frasier

780
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:12,160
until they had shares of Frasier here.

781
00:33:12,160 --> 00:33:14,560
And accidentally some of Brendan Frasier too,

782
00:33:14,560 --> 00:33:16,800
but that's actually paying dividends now.

783
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:20,000
So that's what's going to keep them afloat here in 2020.

784
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:23,120
Oh, and it says here, shipping, exchanges, returns,

785
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:24,960
and Niles are always free.

786
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:28,960
So if you order the Frasier characters,

787
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:30,080
you get free Niles.

788
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:30,800
That's nice.

789
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:34,080
And a $20 styling fee is automatically applied

790
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:36,000
towards anything you keep from your box.

791
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:39,120
And a little bit of Roz's hair is going to be in there.

792
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:39,760
That's weird.

793
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:40,240
Wow.

794
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:41,360
Yeah, it is weird.

795
00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:43,520
It says here they've been stockpiling Roz's hair,

796
00:33:43,520 --> 00:33:47,360
genuine Roz's hair for decades, but get started today.

797
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:51,440
That is stitchfix.com slash my brother.

798
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:53,920
Stitchfix.com slash my brother.

799
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:57,200
You get an extra 25% off when you keep everything in your box,

800
00:33:57,200 --> 00:33:59,200
including Niles, and you have to feed him.

801
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:00,240
You have to feed him.

802
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:01,600
You absolutely must feed him.

803
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:03,040
Don't feed him after midnight.

804
00:34:03,040 --> 00:34:05,440
Let's say you're a clothing company that just made

805
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:07,760
the biggest mistake of your existence.

806
00:34:07,760 --> 00:34:08,800
You're on the ropes.

807
00:34:10,080 --> 00:34:12,000
The bank is on the phone.

808
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:13,920
They're going to come for everything.

809
00:34:13,920 --> 00:34:16,000
You've got one chance to set it all right,

810
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:19,680
and that's to sell all of your copies of Frasier on DVD

811
00:34:19,680 --> 00:34:20,800
at a premium price.

812
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:22,880
I wouldn't even know where to begin, Justin.

813
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:24,640
I know where you're going to begin.

814
00:34:24,640 --> 00:34:26,560
You're going to begin at Squarespace.

815
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:26,960
Oh.

816
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:29,280
It's going to help you showcase your work

817
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:32,000
or your extensive collection of Frasier DVDs.

818
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,960
And humans and actors from Frasier.

819
00:34:35,680 --> 00:34:38,320
And the sets, the prop replicas.

820
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:41,680
They can sell products and services of all kinds.

821
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:47,920
You can promote your physical or online business and more.

822
00:34:47,920 --> 00:34:50,960
They've got beautiful templates created by world-class designers.

823
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:53,200
Everything's optimized for mobile right out of the box.

824
00:34:53,200 --> 00:34:55,280
They've got analytics that can help you see

825
00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:57,600
how many copies of Frasier you've sold so far.

826
00:34:58,240 --> 00:35:00,560
And nothing to patch or upgrade ever.

827
00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:03,440
They handle all that boring stuff for you.

00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:06,480

831
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:17,840
This week on Bullseye, Lin-Manuel Miranda on His Dark Materials,

832
00:35:17,840 --> 00:35:19,760
hip-hop, and life after Hamilton.

833
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:21,920
I know it's the first line of my obituary.

834
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:27,680
So if that line is handled, then what else can I do with my time here?

835
00:35:27,680 --> 00:35:30,800
It's Bullseye for MaximumFun.org and NPR.

836
00:35:33,520 --> 00:35:35,200
How about another question we've only done once?

837
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:36,480
What the fuck?

838
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:53,760
This is unlistenable.

839
00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:55,840
I want a munch.

840
00:35:55,840 --> 00:35:56,340
Squad.

841
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:01,040
I want to munch.

842
00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:01,540
Squad.

843
00:36:01,540 --> 00:36:02,040
Squad.

844
00:36:05,060 --> 00:36:09,300
I'm sorry that allergies or what have you have kept me from-

845
00:36:09,300 --> 00:36:10,180
Really squealing.

846
00:36:11,300 --> 00:36:12,580
I just don't have much in me.

847
00:36:12,580 --> 00:36:19,940
It's like a bassy, extreme more than words take on the munch squad theme song.

848
00:36:19,940 --> 00:36:20,740
It's very depressing.

849
00:36:21,540 --> 00:36:22,900
Now I'll tell you what's not depressing though.

850
00:36:23,780 --> 00:36:26,340
The latest in Gravis and Quick Service dining.

851
00:36:26,340 --> 00:36:32,180
This week's breaking news takes us to a doorstep.

852
00:36:32,180 --> 00:36:35,460
I don't think we've darkened before, but it's one of my favorites

853
00:36:35,460 --> 00:36:40,500
when I'm headed south, headed to the beach at Zaxby's.

854
00:36:40,500 --> 00:36:43,300
Oh, never even heard that word said out loud.

855
00:36:43,300 --> 00:36:48,500
It is both, I believe, a restaurant chain and potentially an alien species.

856
00:36:49,780 --> 00:36:54,100
Yes, when I'm having a Zax attack, I see a doctor,

857
00:36:54,100 --> 00:36:59,700
but he recommends to me usually that I should head into Zaxby's,

858
00:36:59,700 --> 00:37:02,900
which is like a chicken place without the bigotry,

859
00:37:02,900 --> 00:37:05,140
or at least they're better at cloaking.

860
00:37:05,140 --> 00:37:06,020
I have no idea.

861
00:37:06,660 --> 00:37:11,620
But Zaxby's has announced a promotional partnership with Sony Pictures

862
00:37:11,620 --> 00:37:14,260
for its upcoming action adventure film.

863
00:37:14,260 --> 00:37:14,760
Sorry?

864
00:37:16,260 --> 00:37:17,380
Wait, what would you guess?

865
00:37:18,100 --> 00:37:19,380
Chicken attack.

866
00:37:19,380 --> 00:37:20,100
Chicken Sprint.

867
00:37:20,100 --> 00:37:24,500
Chicken, Sony Pictures is making Chicken Sprint,

868
00:37:24,500 --> 00:37:27,780
presumably a spiritual successor to Chicken Run.

869
00:37:27,780 --> 00:37:28,740
Is that what you're suggesting?

870
00:37:28,740 --> 00:37:30,660
No, I'm sorry, Justin, this is actually a prequel to Chicken Run.

871
00:37:31,780 --> 00:37:33,380
The chicken is building up steam.

872
00:37:34,420 --> 00:37:34,920
Griffin?

873
00:37:35,700 --> 00:37:39,620
I mean, let me look at the list of films that this-

874
00:37:39,620 --> 00:37:40,980
That will be too easy.

875
00:37:40,980 --> 00:37:43,300
It's Jumanji, the next level.

876
00:37:43,300 --> 00:37:46,660
Now see, I was gonna say perhaps Sex Tape 2,

877
00:37:46,660 --> 00:37:50,820
or maybe Miracles from Heaven 2, or Goosebumps 3.

878
00:37:50,820 --> 00:37:53,860
Zaxby's, the fast casual fan favorite.

879
00:37:53,860 --> 00:37:57,060
God, these places have a lot of different ways of saying bad.

880
00:37:57,060 --> 00:37:59,300
A lot of fun ways of saying not good.

881
00:37:59,300 --> 00:38:01,700
We've got a cult following here at Zaxby's.

882
00:38:01,700 --> 00:38:06,820
Yeah, this fast casual fan favorite for chicken fingers, wings, and salads.

883
00:38:06,820 --> 00:38:08,260
Don't think so.

884
00:38:08,260 --> 00:38:09,780
On the last one, I don't agree.

885
00:38:10,340 --> 00:38:15,060
Launched its limited time Southwest Chipotle and Smokehouse Cheddar

886
00:38:15,060 --> 00:38:18,820
BBQ Filet Sandwiches.

887
00:38:18,820 --> 00:38:22,100
Can you imagine standing at a fucking register and they're like,

888
00:38:22,100 --> 00:38:23,060
what will you have?

889
00:38:23,060 --> 00:38:29,220
And I'll say, could I have the Southwest Chipotle BBQ Filet Sandwich, please?

890
00:38:29,860 --> 00:38:31,220
It's embarrassing, they need numbers.

891
00:38:31,220 --> 00:38:32,820
Is that the sandwich, Diane?

892
00:38:32,820 --> 00:38:34,660
Because I don't see the connection.

893
00:38:35,540 --> 00:38:38,660
Well, Travis, maybe it'll become more clear to you when you slurp down

894
00:38:38,660 --> 00:38:42,420
an extra extra large Jumanji Citrus Fizz.

895
00:38:42,420 --> 00:38:42,920
Huh.

896
00:38:42,920 --> 00:38:48,120
I don't think if I was a family brand like Zaxby's,

897
00:38:48,840 --> 00:38:54,680
I would make it so easy to say jizz accidentally in my restaurant.

898
00:38:54,680 --> 00:38:57,000
You are basically begging for it.

899
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:58,280
Jumanji Citrus Fizz.

900
00:38:58,280 --> 00:39:02,520
And here's the thing, there'll be a moment where you accidentally say like Fumanji

901
00:39:03,240 --> 00:39:06,440
and like you'll keep talking, but your brain will be like, oh no.

902
00:39:06,440 --> 00:39:07,800
Can I get a Fumanji?

903
00:39:07,800 --> 00:39:09,160
Oh no, I'm about to say jizz.

904
00:39:09,160 --> 00:39:10,840
I would stop talking.

905
00:39:10,840 --> 00:39:11,560
Can I get a-

906
00:39:11,560 --> 00:39:13,000
Your mouth, quit it, abort.

907
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:14,120
You're about to say jizz.

908
00:39:14,680 --> 00:39:16,360
Oh boy, I would, I am parched.

909
00:39:16,360 --> 00:39:18,280
I would love a Fumanji jizz mist.

910
00:39:18,280 --> 00:39:20,280
Ah, beans.

911
00:39:21,320 --> 00:39:21,800
Dang it.

912
00:39:21,800 --> 00:39:24,680
Oh, you wanted a Fumanji jizz mist with beans?

913
00:39:24,680 --> 00:39:26,360
Yeah, I may as well.

914
00:39:26,360 --> 00:39:33,000
Yeah, we strive to give our guests exciting flavor options and our new Southwest Chipotle

915
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:37,000
and classic Smokehouse Cheddar BBQ sandwiches do just that,

916
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:39,720
says Zaxby's Chief Marketing Officer, Joel Bolger.

917
00:39:39,720 --> 00:39:43,640
Don't you think that there should be a law where if you're going to put a quote

918
00:39:44,440 --> 00:39:51,160
into a document, you must first say the phrase out loud with your human mouth,

919
00:39:51,160 --> 00:39:54,120
or illegally it can't be written down as a quote.

920
00:39:54,120 --> 00:39:56,120
Like Joel actually had to say out loud,

921
00:39:56,920 --> 00:40:01,960
we strive to give our guests exciting flavor options and our new Southwest Chipotle

922
00:40:01,960 --> 00:40:05,480
and classic Smokehouse Cheddar BBQ sandwiches do just that.

923
00:40:05,480 --> 00:40:11,560
Joel then continues the great tradition of Munch Squad providers being defensive in their quotes.

924
00:40:12,440 --> 00:40:17,960
He says, teaming up with Sony Pictures on Jumanji, the next level, just makes sense.

925
00:40:17,960 --> 00:40:20,200
I don't know.

926
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:25,160
It's like they're doing a Jumanji and we got some new fucking sandwiches and some citrus jizz.

927
00:40:25,160 --> 00:40:25,880
Damn it.

928
00:40:25,880 --> 00:40:26,360
Damn it.

929
00:40:26,360 --> 00:40:27,160
I did it again.

930
00:40:27,160 --> 00:40:32,280
Now Justin, you haven't seen the first Jumanji, well the remake sequel.

931
00:40:32,280 --> 00:40:34,280
I've tried several times.

932
00:40:34,280 --> 00:40:37,640
I've tried several times to watch the second Jumanji.

933
00:40:37,640 --> 00:40:42,760
But you have not reached the point where the rock just barrels that camera and says,

934
00:40:42,760 --> 00:40:45,240
my God, it burns so much, my citrus jizz.

935
00:40:46,520 --> 00:40:48,680
Get it out, get it out, please get it out of me.

936
00:40:48,680 --> 00:40:49,560
What is this horrible curse?

937
00:40:49,560 --> 00:40:59,560
A scorpion got me on my thingy thingy and it's a hot flaming hot Fumanji mist in there.

938
00:40:59,560 --> 00:41:02,840
And I could really use some help here.

939
00:41:02,840 --> 00:41:08,440
I'm going to jump off this cliff so I can respawn and get a new life where my pee pee

940
00:41:08,440 --> 00:41:10,680
isn't like so full of scorpion venom.

941
00:41:10,680 --> 00:41:12,440
I think the sandwiches are too much.

942
00:41:12,440 --> 00:41:18,040
The Southwest Chipotle filet sandwich has hand breaded filet, pickled jalapenos,

943
00:41:18,840 --> 00:41:23,480
pepper jack cheese, spicy chipotle aioli, fresh lettuce and tomato,

944
00:41:23,480 --> 00:41:25,960
all served on a toasted potato bun.

945
00:41:25,960 --> 00:41:26,760
Does that sound good?

946
00:41:26,760 --> 00:41:31,720
I mean, it would rip me into pieces.

947
00:41:31,720 --> 00:41:34,360
Does that sound like a last sandwich worthy of your last sandwich?

948
00:41:35,080 --> 00:41:41,880
It would shred me up and scatter me over the fucking 2020 Democratic National Convention.

949
00:41:41,880 --> 00:41:43,880
Like it would fuck me right up.

950
00:41:43,880 --> 00:41:46,760
But OK, talk about self burns.

951
00:41:46,760 --> 00:41:53,320
This press release by Zaxby's goes on to say these two hand breaded made to order

952
00:41:53,320 --> 00:42:01,560
customizable chicken sandwich meals are fast, casual quality at quick service pace and pricing.

953
00:42:01,560 --> 00:42:03,000
OK, OK.

954
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:03,720
Wow.

955
00:42:03,720 --> 00:42:04,680
Wow, really?

956
00:42:04,680 --> 00:42:09,960
Hey, listen, we ran for the top and this is like a sandwich you get at Applebee's, my man.

957
00:42:09,960 --> 00:42:11,160
Like there's that right there.

958
00:42:11,160 --> 00:42:11,560
Exactly.

959
00:42:11,560 --> 00:42:12,920
Say like you could get that.

960
00:42:12,920 --> 00:42:16,280
You eat this sandwich and be like, fuck, am I at Applebee's?

961
00:42:16,280 --> 00:42:17,320
Is this at Chili's?

962
00:42:17,320 --> 00:42:18,680
Because this is amazing.

963
00:42:19,320 --> 00:42:21,240
This is fucking so good.

964
00:42:21,240 --> 00:42:26,920
Customers looking for a movie themed drink may try the custom limited time Coca-Cola

965
00:42:26,920 --> 00:42:29,400
freestyle Jumanji citrus fizz.

966
00:42:29,960 --> 00:42:31,560
Also available in white.

967
00:42:31,560 --> 00:42:32,200
Thank God.

968
00:42:32,840 --> 00:42:36,040
Made with the Minute Maid orange and Seagram's ginger ale.

969
00:42:36,600 --> 00:42:39,480
The beverage has a sparkling citrusy orange taste.

970
00:42:39,480 --> 00:42:40,760
I wonder how they get it.

971
00:42:40,760 --> 00:42:43,720
Is it maybe by mixing Minute Maid orange and ginger ale?

972
00:42:43,720 --> 00:42:45,960
You just gave me the fucking recipe.

973
00:42:45,960 --> 00:42:46,840
I'll do it at home.

974
00:42:46,840 --> 00:42:51,240
This is so great because I was really craving a won't you be my neighbor Baja blast, but

975
00:42:51,240 --> 00:42:53,880
it's really great that I don't have to wait for a movie themed drink.

976
00:42:55,000 --> 00:43:00,280
The beverage has a sparkling citrusy orange taste that pairs with either of the new sandwiches.

977
00:43:00,280 --> 00:43:10,440
Oh, the Seagram's ginger ale really helps to push the hard sandwich down my throat.

978
00:43:10,440 --> 00:43:11,160
What an excellent pairing.

979
00:43:11,160 --> 00:43:12,680
It's a perfect pairing.

980
00:43:12,680 --> 00:43:14,680
I'm able to swallow it.

981
00:43:14,680 --> 00:43:22,840
Guests are invited to enjoy the drink in a 42 ounce Jumanji the next level theme commemorative

982
00:43:22,840 --> 00:43:23,080
cup.

983
00:43:23,080 --> 00:43:26,120
I'm going to save this for ever.

984
00:43:26,120 --> 00:43:30,120
You're coming home to live with me in a place of honor Jumanji cup.

985
00:43:30,120 --> 00:43:37,880
Zaxby's broad audience base lines perfectly with the all audience appeal of Jumanji the

986
00:43:37,880 --> 00:43:44,760
next level, but more importantly they strive for creative execution and have done it again

987
00:43:44,760 --> 00:43:48,760
with the spots they created in collaboration with our film.

988
00:43:49,640 --> 00:43:51,800
Says, silence.

989
00:43:52,600 --> 00:43:57,480
I'm going to read this last name exactly as it's written and I don't want a single peep

990
00:43:57,480 --> 00:43:58,200
to interrupt it.

991
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:01,240
Says Jeffrey, God sick.

992
00:44:03,480 --> 00:44:04,520
God sick.

993
00:44:04,520 --> 00:44:05,880
Munch squad did it.

994
00:44:05,880 --> 00:44:06,520
God sick.

995
00:44:07,080 --> 00:44:07,560
Help.

996
00:44:07,560 --> 00:44:09,880
God, the God is sick.

997
00:44:10,600 --> 00:44:15,000
Executive vice president of brand management and global partnerships for Sony Pictures

998
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:16,040
motion picture group.

999
00:44:17,640 --> 00:44:19,720
The TV spots are clever and funny.

1000
00:44:19,720 --> 00:44:21,480
That's all Jeff's got left.

1001
00:44:22,600 --> 00:44:24,760
Jeff's got one thing left.

1002
00:44:24,760 --> 00:44:29,240
Hey, I want you to put my entire name and then my insane title and then I'll come back.

1003
00:44:29,240 --> 00:44:32,120
I'll spin back around like a one more thing.

1004
00:44:32,120 --> 00:44:34,360
The TV spots are clever and funny.

1005
00:44:34,360 --> 00:44:35,160
Oh, geez.

1006
00:44:35,160 --> 00:44:39,560
Okay, I don't know how much more of this I can take.

1007
00:44:40,680 --> 00:44:42,360
That's all of that.

1008
00:44:42,360 --> 00:44:44,920
So that's available now so you can go get that shit.

1009
00:44:44,920 --> 00:44:47,080
Okay, how about our second question?

1010
00:44:47,080 --> 00:44:51,160
I've always been a little insecure of my rather small vocabulary compared to my friends.

1011
00:44:51,720 --> 00:44:56,120
For 2019, I bought a word a day calendar with a new word definition to learn.

1012
00:44:56,680 --> 00:45:00,680
I'm assuming each day, not the same one over and over again.

1013
00:45:00,680 --> 00:45:08,200
I looked at it every day for about all three weeks and then I forgot about it even existing.

1014
00:45:08,200 --> 00:45:12,440
I still have it and I'm hesitant to throw it out since I paid real actually money for it

1015
00:45:12,440 --> 00:45:16,840
but it hasn't been touched for more than to move it from place to place since mid-January.

1016
00:45:17,480 --> 00:45:22,360
I could try it again for 2020 but it lists the day of the week as well as the date

1017
00:45:22,360 --> 00:45:26,440
and I wouldn't want to read my word a day calendar until I'd be at Sunday on a Monday

1018
00:45:26,440 --> 00:45:27,960
and end up not going into work.

1019
00:45:27,960 --> 00:45:30,920
What should I do with my word a day calendar?

1020
00:45:30,920 --> 00:45:33,080
That's from Rice M.

1021
00:45:33,080 --> 00:45:33,640
Or Reese.

1022
00:45:34,280 --> 00:45:35,080
Or Reese.

1023
00:45:35,080 --> 00:45:35,560
Probably Reese.

1024
00:45:35,560 --> 00:45:36,600
So let's see.

1025
00:45:36,600 --> 00:45:41,640
There's, as we're recording this, 10 divided by 41.

1026
00:45:41,640 --> 00:45:43,000
Let me do some quick math here.

1027
00:45:44,440 --> 00:45:45,800
Do you do math on your dog?

1028
00:45:46,440 --> 00:45:46,680
Yeah.

1029
00:45:47,480 --> 00:45:48,280
What the fuck?

1030
00:45:48,280 --> 00:45:51,000
Is your dog also a quackulator?

1031
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:51,500
Yeah.

1032
00:45:52,280 --> 00:45:56,840
Okay, so this has just become an eight word a day calendar.

1033
00:45:56,840 --> 00:45:57,240
Okay.

1034
00:45:57,240 --> 00:45:58,120
No big deal.

1035
00:45:58,120 --> 00:45:59,160
Yeah, you can do that.

1036
00:45:59,160 --> 00:46:00,440
Eight words a day?

1037
00:46:00,440 --> 00:46:01,000
That's not bad.

1038
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:01,720
You could do that.

1039
00:46:02,920 --> 00:46:03,720
Some of them you'll know.

1040
00:46:03,720 --> 00:46:04,220
Yes.

1041
00:46:04,760 --> 00:46:05,400
You gotta look forward to that.

1042
00:46:05,400 --> 00:46:06,360
Some of them you'll know.

1043
00:46:06,360 --> 00:46:10,280
You know they throw in a page every like couple weeks or so where it's like,

1044
00:46:10,280 --> 00:46:12,520
bus, take it easy today.

1045
00:46:12,520 --> 00:46:16,120
Bus is the long car that we all go in.

1046
00:46:17,960 --> 00:46:20,360
But then it's gonna get you right back into a long word.

1047
00:46:20,360 --> 00:46:21,640
Like hippopotamus.

1048
00:46:21,640 --> 00:46:22,280
Yes.

1049
00:46:22,280 --> 00:46:22,920
A tuffy.

1050
00:46:23,800 --> 00:46:26,200
A tuffy to work into casual conversation.

1051
00:46:26,200 --> 00:46:28,600
And yeah, hard day at work.

1052
00:46:28,600 --> 00:46:31,400
Hey Derek, yeah, it's like a real hippopotamus out there.

1053
00:46:32,120 --> 00:46:34,680
Yeah, did you guys see the bus this morning?

1054
00:46:36,920 --> 00:46:40,360
That was like eight hippopotamuses all stacked like end to end, right?

1055
00:46:41,080 --> 00:46:42,280
Big one.

1056
00:46:42,280 --> 00:46:43,320
Big ones.

1057
00:46:43,320 --> 00:46:46,680
Anyway, hypotenuse.

1058
00:46:46,680 --> 00:46:47,180
See ya.

1059
00:46:50,680 --> 00:46:52,520
Yeah, I mean, I would just start cranking.

1060
00:46:52,520 --> 00:46:56,280
I would just pull up to your bedside, just start cranking through.

1061
00:46:56,280 --> 00:46:57,480
You gotta see how it ends.

1062
00:46:58,840 --> 00:47:02,280
Yeah, I mean, there's probably a through line in there.

1063
00:47:02,280 --> 00:47:04,680
I feel like word of the day calendars is cheating though,

1064
00:47:04,680 --> 00:47:08,760
because you should just get some, you know, some big old books

1065
00:47:08,760 --> 00:47:13,080
and find the words in them like, you know, like old school style.

1066
00:47:14,280 --> 00:47:16,840
Like an old book that you don't know and you don't understand it.

1067
00:47:16,840 --> 00:47:20,600
And so you read it and cheat on the accelerated reader test on it.

1068
00:47:20,600 --> 00:47:22,920
And you pick up a few words from it that way.

1069
00:47:22,920 --> 00:47:25,400
I feel like that's a more organic, a more organic.

1070
00:47:25,400 --> 00:47:27,960
You pick up the words like treasure, an island.

1071
00:47:28,680 --> 00:47:31,960
I learned a lot of words from the accelerated reader test

1072
00:47:31,960 --> 00:47:33,720
for Red Badge of Courage, so.

1073
00:47:35,080 --> 00:47:36,280
Here's the thing though, Griffin.

1074
00:47:36,280 --> 00:47:39,720
I would argue that if this question asker does not have the time

1075
00:47:40,280 --> 00:47:42,360
to look at the calendar every day,

1076
00:47:42,360 --> 00:47:45,560
probably don't want time to read thick, thick, heavy, yeah.

1077
00:47:46,600 --> 00:47:50,360
Yeah, I mean, it's not the biggest book, but it is challenging.

1078
00:47:50,360 --> 00:47:54,600
Could you hire someone to yell a word at you every day

1079
00:47:54,600 --> 00:47:57,880
that you don't know, like they find you.

1080
00:47:57,880 --> 00:47:59,720
Why would they have to yell it?

1081
00:47:59,720 --> 00:48:03,640
Well, cause I just assumed that you'd be busy running to the next thing

1082
00:48:04,360 --> 00:48:07,400
and they would just like yell a big word at you as you ran by.

1083
00:48:07,400 --> 00:48:08,280
Pogritudinous.

1084
00:48:09,640 --> 00:48:12,760
That would be cool, except they wouldn't tell you what it means

1085
00:48:13,480 --> 00:48:16,760
and it would scare everyone around you and you wouldn't learn.

1086
00:48:16,760 --> 00:48:19,320
I just said the word pogritudinous, I don't know what it means.

1087
00:48:19,320 --> 00:48:21,000
I think it means beautiful.

1088
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:21,720
Does it?

1089
00:48:21,720 --> 00:48:23,080
Cause it sounds kind of gross.

1090
00:48:23,080 --> 00:48:25,560
It's the grossest word, but I think it means beautiful.

1091
00:48:26,200 --> 00:48:28,040
I don't think you should take on projects like this.

1092
00:48:28,600 --> 00:48:30,920
Okay, I don't think you should do this.

1093
00:48:31,560 --> 00:48:35,240
We got a puzzle a day calendar last Christmas

1094
00:48:35,240 --> 00:48:40,440
and we had a thing where we were writing like a memory,

1095
00:48:40,440 --> 00:48:42,360
something that happened that day on the back of it

1096
00:48:42,360 --> 00:48:43,960
and then put it into a jar, right?

1097
00:48:43,960 --> 00:48:44,840
That's a lot of work.

1098
00:48:44,840 --> 00:48:47,080
And then it's like a lot of work, right?

1099
00:48:47,080 --> 00:48:49,880
And then it got to May and by the time it got to May,

1100
00:48:49,880 --> 00:48:54,360
like fucking life, you know, like life got in the way.

1101
00:48:55,160 --> 00:48:57,800
And it's like, what happened to us three weeks ago?

1102
00:48:57,800 --> 00:48:58,360
I don't know.

1103
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:03,000
And now we've got this sad jar with like four months of memories

1104
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:05,880
and I literally don't think I will have,

1105
00:49:05,880 --> 00:49:07,400
the idea is supposed to be at the end of the year,

1106
00:49:07,400 --> 00:49:08,200
you get them all out.

1107
00:49:08,200 --> 00:49:09,640
You're like, remember when?

1108
00:49:09,640 --> 00:49:11,880
But I don't think I'll have the fucking guts

1109
00:49:11,880 --> 00:49:15,480
to face this failed project come December.

1110
00:49:15,480 --> 00:49:17,480
I'm gonna look at it and just feel so hollow

1111
00:49:18,120 --> 00:49:21,720
about the months and months of unsaved memories.

1112
00:49:21,720 --> 00:49:23,000
It's too depressing.

1113
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:24,680
That's why I just live in the moment

1114
00:49:24,680 --> 00:49:26,440
and then forget about it.

1115
00:49:26,440 --> 00:49:27,320
That's it, move on.

1116
00:49:28,520 --> 00:49:30,760
Here's some honest to gosh stuff.

1117
00:49:30,760 --> 00:49:34,280
Don't sweat your, you know, narrower vocabulary.

1118
00:49:35,560 --> 00:49:37,640
Sure, I know what the word pulchritudinous means.

1119
00:49:37,640 --> 00:49:39,160
Like I'm a real fucking mensa

1120
00:49:39,160 --> 00:49:41,000
just fucking balling out all the time.

1121
00:49:41,800 --> 00:49:43,480
Everyone thinks I'm so cool and smart.

1122
00:49:43,480 --> 00:49:46,600
But also that can be insufferable.

1123
00:49:46,600 --> 00:49:51,160
And so just don't sweat it, you do you.

1124
00:49:51,160 --> 00:49:54,360
Find the words, find the powerful words for you.

1125
00:49:54,360 --> 00:49:56,040
If you don't know pulchritudinous,

1126
00:49:56,040 --> 00:49:57,560
it's because you've already decided

1127
00:49:57,560 --> 00:49:59,080
that that's not a powerful word for you.

1128
00:49:59,080 --> 00:50:00,360
You could just say beautiful.

1129
00:50:00,360 --> 00:50:03,640
You could just say beautiful or hella pretty.

1130
00:50:03,640 --> 00:50:07,320
And that could be, that felt awful coming out of my mouth.

1131
00:50:07,320 --> 00:50:12,360
That felt like I just sort of produced slugs out of my tongue

1132
00:50:12,360 --> 00:50:15,480
but it might sound super cool coming out of your mouth

1133
00:50:15,480 --> 00:50:18,040
if you're like a badass skateboarder or something.

1134
00:50:18,040 --> 00:50:19,720
Find your power words.

1135
00:50:19,720 --> 00:50:20,680
And here's the thing.

1136
00:50:20,680 --> 00:50:23,160
Let me tell you, this is a little Travis McElroy top tip here

1137
00:50:23,160 --> 00:50:26,600
and I'm a little bit loathe to give the secret away.

1138
00:50:26,600 --> 00:50:28,680
But if someone uses a big word, like Griffin,

1139
00:50:28,680 --> 00:50:30,680
say that building is pulchritudinous.

1140
00:50:31,640 --> 00:50:33,720
That building is pulchritudinous.

1141
00:50:33,720 --> 00:50:35,080
Okay, yeah.

1142
00:50:36,360 --> 00:50:39,400
Like, oh, that's cool, I'm like not listening.

1143
00:50:39,400 --> 00:50:41,480
No, I'm just saying like you don't have to then like say,

1144
00:50:41,480 --> 00:50:43,960
like you don't have to use it in a sentence.

1145
00:50:43,960 --> 00:50:44,920
You're an adult.

1146
00:50:44,920 --> 00:50:46,680
If someone says something's pulchritudinous

1147
00:50:46,680 --> 00:50:48,360
and then you're like, I don't know what that means.

1148
00:50:48,920 --> 00:50:50,840
Like you don't have to apologize for that.

1149
00:50:50,840 --> 00:50:52,280
You don't even have to acknowledge it

1150
00:50:52,280 --> 00:50:53,240
if you don't want to.

1151
00:50:53,240 --> 00:50:55,160
You can just say like, okay, whatever.

1152
00:50:55,160 --> 00:50:57,080
Anyways, what do you want for lunch?

1153
00:50:57,080 --> 00:51:00,280
Like Travis, I know that you feel

1154
00:51:00,280 --> 00:51:02,120
like you're being helpful right now

1155
00:51:02,120 --> 00:51:04,280
but I assure you that you're not.

1156
00:51:04,280 --> 00:51:06,200
I don't know how you've lulled yourself

1157
00:51:06,200 --> 00:51:09,560
into a sense of feeling like this is good stuff

1158
00:51:09,560 --> 00:51:12,280
that you're coming up with right now, but you're not.

1159
00:51:12,280 --> 00:51:13,080
You're not helping.

1160
00:51:13,080 --> 00:51:14,520
Play it the other way, my big man.

1161
00:51:14,520 --> 00:51:16,600
You tell me a fancy word

1162
00:51:16,600 --> 00:51:18,360
and how you would deal with someone saying it to you.

1163
00:51:18,360 --> 00:51:20,840
And you give me a fancy word that I don't know.

1164
00:51:21,480 --> 00:51:24,520
Let's say I'm looking around Twitter here, not seeing any.

1165
00:51:24,520 --> 00:51:25,560
Okay, give me a second one.

1166
00:51:26,360 --> 00:51:27,640
Bupropion.

1167
00:51:27,640 --> 00:51:28,840
I'm just looking around my desk.

1168
00:51:28,840 --> 00:51:31,080
I'm just sort of shooting it off the cuff.

1169
00:51:32,280 --> 00:51:33,160
What's that mean?

1170
00:51:33,160 --> 00:51:33,960
Bupropion.

1171
00:51:34,520 --> 00:51:36,680
Well, if you take one tablet by mouth twice a day,

1172
00:51:36,680 --> 00:51:39,880
then it helps sort of the brain troubles the ghosts,

1173
00:51:40,680 --> 00:51:42,360
the sort of specters.

1174
00:51:42,360 --> 00:51:43,000
Yeah.

1175
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:44,120
Thank you for sharing that with me.

1176
00:51:44,120 --> 00:51:45,960
I appreciate you taking the time to do that.

1177
00:51:45,960 --> 00:51:48,840
Okay, now do you think that, Griffin,

1178
00:51:48,840 --> 00:51:50,680
do you now think that I'm a normal human being

1179
00:51:50,680 --> 00:51:52,600
or a fucking sociopath?

1180
00:51:52,600 --> 00:51:55,640
I think probably more normal than what Travis.

1181
00:51:55,640 --> 00:51:57,720
Okay, that's kind of like a more normal thing.

1182
00:51:57,720 --> 00:51:58,680
I'm saying, you know what?

1183
00:51:58,680 --> 00:52:00,840
I've got confidence, boys.

1184
00:52:00,840 --> 00:52:03,800
I don't need to learn any of your stupid words, all right?

1185
00:52:03,800 --> 00:52:06,440
The other possibility is that you say,

1186
00:52:06,440 --> 00:52:08,760
oh, that building's so pulchritudinous.

1187
00:52:08,760 --> 00:52:11,160
And then you say, what does that mean?

1188
00:52:11,160 --> 00:52:14,200
And then they either say, oh, fuck, I don't know.

1189
00:52:14,200 --> 00:52:15,800
Or they say the wrong thing.

1190
00:52:15,800 --> 00:52:17,960
And congratulations, you've just wandered

1191
00:52:17,960 --> 00:52:21,000
into the most delectable scenario imaginable.

1192
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:21,960
Oh, for real?

1193
00:52:21,960 --> 00:52:23,160
Oh, but you said it.

1194
00:52:23,880 --> 00:52:24,920
Wow, for real though?

1195
00:52:24,920 --> 00:52:28,120
Because you said it like a big old English professor.

1196
00:52:28,120 --> 00:52:30,920
Like a big smart Egbert, huh?

1197
00:52:30,920 --> 00:52:32,200
But you said it.

1198
00:52:32,200 --> 00:52:34,120
Shit, interesting.

1199
00:52:35,160 --> 00:52:36,840
That's not a power word.

1200
00:52:36,840 --> 00:52:38,520
That's a weakness word.

1201
00:52:38,520 --> 00:52:39,480
Do you guys want a Yahoo?

1202
00:52:39,480 --> 00:52:40,280
Yeah, I'd like that.

1203
00:52:40,280 --> 00:52:41,080
We'll do a quick one.

1204
00:52:41,080 --> 00:52:42,360
But this one is sent by Catherine.

1205
00:52:42,360 --> 00:52:44,520
It's by another anonymous Yahoo Answers user.

1206
00:52:45,720 --> 00:52:49,560
I'm gonna call him Jer-bear asks,

1207
00:52:50,440 --> 00:52:53,400
my dog jumped at an elderly man on a walk

1208
00:52:53,400 --> 00:52:54,920
and made him fall over.

1209
00:52:54,920 --> 00:52:57,480
I walked away quickly and didn't look back.

1210
00:52:57,480 --> 00:52:58,680
What will happen?

1211
00:52:58,680 --> 00:53:01,160
Oh no, wait, who?

1212
00:53:01,160 --> 00:53:03,400
Update, don't be funny, he's not dead.

1213
00:53:03,400 --> 00:53:05,800
I didn't hear any ambulance in my neighborhood that day.

1214
00:53:05,800 --> 00:53:06,520
Oh God.

1215
00:53:07,800 --> 00:53:09,400
I don't know exactly where he lives,

1216
00:53:09,400 --> 00:53:10,440
but I haven't seen him since.

1217
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:12,680
Update, update three.

1218
00:53:13,240 --> 00:53:14,920
It's been three days, I'm all clear.

1219
00:53:14,920 --> 00:53:15,960
Thank God I got lucky.

1220
00:53:17,160 --> 00:53:17,660
What?

1221
00:53:18,360 --> 00:53:19,160
So what happened?

1222
00:53:19,880 --> 00:53:21,000
Sorry, I'll start over.

1223
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:23,160
My dog did jump at an elderly man

1224
00:53:23,160 --> 00:53:25,000
on a walk and made him fall over.

1225
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:27,240
Not great, not a great start.

1226
00:53:27,240 --> 00:53:28,680
Not great, not great.

1227
00:53:28,680 --> 00:53:31,080
I walked away quickly and didn't look back.

1228
00:53:31,080 --> 00:53:33,960
Not great, pretty not great.

1229
00:53:35,320 --> 00:53:36,040
What will happen?

1230
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:38,920
But then three days have passed.

1231
00:53:38,920 --> 00:53:40,760
So quote, I'm all clear.

1232
00:53:40,760 --> 00:53:42,120
Smiley face emoticon.

1233
00:53:42,120 --> 00:53:43,080
Thank God I got lucky.

1234
00:53:43,080 --> 00:53:43,800
He's dead.

1235
00:53:43,800 --> 00:53:45,000
He's apparently dead.

1236
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:47,320
I'm not being questioned in connection.

1237
00:53:47,320 --> 00:53:48,600
Listen, if we go that route,

1238
00:53:48,600 --> 00:53:50,200
it's gonna be hard to play in the space.

1239
00:53:50,200 --> 00:53:51,880
No ambulances were heard that day.

1240
00:53:53,480 --> 00:53:55,640
The question askers sold their dog up the river.

1241
00:53:56,200 --> 00:53:57,880
Oh, okay.

1242
00:53:57,880 --> 00:54:02,040
Yeah, I told my dog not to jump on the old man.

1243
00:54:02,040 --> 00:54:02,920
I said, don't do it.

1244
00:54:02,920 --> 00:54:03,960
And he said, I'm gonna do it.

1245
00:54:03,960 --> 00:54:05,480
And I said, no, that's wrong.

1246
00:54:06,280 --> 00:54:09,800
Yeah, you could say that there was coins

1247
00:54:10,440 --> 00:54:11,880
floating above the old man

1248
00:54:12,440 --> 00:54:14,200
that your dog was just trying to get him.

1249
00:54:14,840 --> 00:54:16,200
And he got bonked.

1250
00:54:16,760 --> 00:54:18,280
And there's just no way around it.

1251
00:54:20,120 --> 00:54:23,960
The old man was cosplaying as his favorite character

1252
00:54:23,960 --> 00:54:28,360
from the upcoming smash hit movie, Cats.

1253
00:54:29,160 --> 00:54:30,920
And that made the dog angry

1254
00:54:30,920 --> 00:54:32,280
because he hadn't seen it yet

1255
00:54:32,280 --> 00:54:34,440
and it felt like it had been spoiled for him.

1256
00:54:34,440 --> 00:54:36,440
He's been trying to go in clean.

1257
00:54:36,440 --> 00:54:38,520
He's been trying to go into the theater pure.

1258
00:54:39,160 --> 00:54:40,440
And that's a shame

1259
00:54:40,440 --> 00:54:43,400
because boy, is that dog not gonna like that movie.

1260
00:54:43,400 --> 00:54:45,560
This is about a bunch of tall cats, folks.

1261
00:54:46,680 --> 00:54:49,160
He's thinking surely it can't be about cats.

1262
00:54:49,160 --> 00:54:50,440
Gotta be an ironic name.

1263
00:54:51,720 --> 00:54:52,920
They wouldn't be that.

1264
00:54:52,920 --> 00:54:55,720
Like they know there's dogs out here trying to see movies.

1265
00:54:55,720 --> 00:54:57,560
There's no way it's just about cats.

1266
00:54:57,560 --> 00:54:59,240
There's gotta be something we're missing.

1267
00:54:59,240 --> 00:55:02,360
How's that, has that old gearbox you got up

1268
00:55:02,360 --> 00:55:03,880
locked up in that skull work

1269
00:55:04,440 --> 00:55:07,480
that when your dog does jump up on the elderly man

1270
00:55:07,480 --> 00:55:11,480
and he does fall down, you just dip?

1271
00:55:12,760 --> 00:55:14,360
And don't look back.

1272
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:17,800
The not looking back is also troubling, Travis.

1273
00:55:18,680 --> 00:55:20,200
Yeah, very troubling.

1274
00:55:20,200 --> 00:55:21,960
I would say what's gonna happen,

1275
00:55:21,960 --> 00:55:24,840
you're probably okay here.

1276
00:55:24,840 --> 00:55:27,480
I would hope that some sort of judgment,

1277
00:55:28,520 --> 00:55:32,760
be it divine or karmic or whatever, awaits you.

1278
00:55:32,760 --> 00:55:34,040
But you know what?

1279
00:55:34,040 --> 00:55:35,640
It's been three days.

1280
00:55:36,360 --> 00:55:36,840
Yeah.

1281
00:55:36,840 --> 00:55:37,880
It's probably fine.

1282
00:55:37,880 --> 00:55:38,520
But you know what?

1283
00:55:39,720 --> 00:55:41,000
The old man knows.

1284
00:55:42,600 --> 00:55:43,720
And does he?

1285
00:55:43,720 --> 00:55:45,800
Cause it seems like you played it off so well

1286
00:55:45,800 --> 00:55:46,920
by walking away.

1287
00:55:46,920 --> 00:55:48,600
Yeah, what was that wild dog by itself?

1288
00:55:48,600 --> 00:55:51,560
And loudly announcing whose dog is doing this?

1289
00:55:51,560 --> 00:55:53,240
Someone please come get this dog.

1290
00:55:53,240 --> 00:55:55,000
I see this dog is causing you issue.

1291
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:56,920
I'll grab his leash and take him away.

1292
00:55:57,560 --> 00:55:59,480
Or you should, that's why you should always have

1293
00:55:59,480 --> 00:56:01,080
a fake mustache in your pocket

1294
00:56:01,080 --> 00:56:02,760
so you can walk away very quickly

1295
00:56:02,760 --> 00:56:04,840
and then come back with the fake mustache like,

1296
00:56:04,840 --> 00:56:07,320
hi, excuse me, is this dog causing you trouble?

1297
00:56:07,960 --> 00:56:12,520
Oh no, the dog has bound my wrist with this leash

1298
00:56:12,520 --> 00:56:13,880
and it's tugging me along

1299
00:56:13,880 --> 00:56:16,360
and I am waiting for him to make poopies and peepees.

1300
00:56:17,160 --> 00:56:18,680
I do love him very much.

1301
00:56:18,680 --> 00:56:20,120
I forget what I was doing.

1302
00:56:20,120 --> 00:56:23,320
I'm sorry about knocking you very over though, old man.

1303
00:56:23,320 --> 00:56:24,440
Do you need help?

1304
00:56:24,440 --> 00:56:26,440
Whoa, you jumped back up by yourself

1305
00:56:26,440 --> 00:56:28,040
cause you're very healthy

1306
00:56:28,040 --> 00:56:30,840
and there's nothing to be sad about in this question.

1307
00:56:30,840 --> 00:56:32,200
We're having fun in the space.

1308
00:56:33,080 --> 00:56:34,040
Here's what I'll just say.

1309
00:56:34,600 --> 00:56:35,480
Here's what I'll say.

1310
00:56:35,480 --> 00:56:36,680
All right, I'm just gonna say this.

1311
00:56:37,720 --> 00:56:40,920
Original Sid, the thing to remember is

1312
00:56:41,960 --> 00:56:44,360
there is Sid in this whole man's heart.

1313
00:56:44,360 --> 00:56:47,800
And he probably did deserve it

1314
00:56:47,800 --> 00:56:51,880
for something he did because all are fallible.

1315
00:56:52,600 --> 00:56:56,520
And fallible, it seems like, cause he did do that,

1316
00:56:56,520 --> 00:57:00,120
a big one, but he's okay so we can have fun with it.

1317
00:57:01,240 --> 00:57:02,440
It's not sad.

1318
00:57:02,440 --> 00:57:04,040
It is not sad.

1319
00:57:04,040 --> 00:57:05,960
We can't stress this enough.

1320
00:57:05,960 --> 00:57:07,960
This is not a sad situation.

1321
00:57:07,960 --> 00:57:09,080
Oh, it's from the old man.

1322
00:57:09,720 --> 00:57:13,160
Oh, when he fell down, he found $100 on the ground.

1323
00:57:13,160 --> 00:57:13,720
Cool.

1324
00:57:13,720 --> 00:57:15,000
Oh, that's great.

1325
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:16,920
Oh, it says here, I'm really glad.

1326
00:57:16,920 --> 00:57:17,960
Wait, let me scroll down.

1327
00:57:17,960 --> 00:57:19,240
Oh, the dog knocked me down.

1328
00:57:19,800 --> 00:57:21,560
I'm healthier than I was before.

1329
00:57:22,280 --> 00:57:25,320
Huh, I adopted the dog as my son.

1330
00:57:25,320 --> 00:57:26,840
Oh shit, ring, ring, ring, ring.

1331
00:57:26,840 --> 00:57:28,200
Oh guys, hold on, I got a phone call.

1332
00:57:28,200 --> 00:57:28,840
Beep, hello.

1333
00:57:28,840 --> 00:57:29,480
Oh, okay.

1334
00:57:29,480 --> 00:57:31,800
Hey, it's me, the old dog man.

1335
00:57:31,800 --> 00:57:32,840
Hi, old dog man.

1336
00:57:32,840 --> 00:57:34,120
How are you feeling?

1337
00:57:34,120 --> 00:57:35,160
We're really worried about you.

1338
00:57:35,160 --> 00:57:35,720
We can't hear him.

1339
00:57:35,720 --> 00:57:36,520
Could you patch him in?

1340
00:57:37,960 --> 00:57:39,880
Hey, it's me, the old dog man.

1341
00:57:39,880 --> 00:57:40,360
Oh, hey.

1342
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:43,960
Yep, just wanted to say that darn dog did knock me over

1343
00:57:43,960 --> 00:57:45,800
and I thought I was gonna go up

1344
00:57:45,800 --> 00:57:48,520
and hang out with Jesus and old Rebecca.

1345
00:57:48,520 --> 00:57:50,680
And I'll tell you about old Rebecca later.

1346
00:57:50,680 --> 00:57:53,320
We don't have that many Skype minutes.

1347
00:57:54,120 --> 00:57:57,320
But it's, I fell down right on my fucking sacral iliac

1348
00:57:57,320 --> 00:57:59,240
and popped it right back into place, didn't it?

1349
00:58:00,520 --> 00:58:00,840
Okay.

1350
00:58:02,680 --> 00:58:05,240
Look out, look out, tap dancing stage.

1351
00:58:05,240 --> 00:58:06,680
Cause dog man's coming.

1352
00:58:09,320 --> 00:58:12,280
Are you gonna perform as dog man?

1353
00:58:12,280 --> 00:58:15,000
Will that be your sort of stage identity?

1354
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:17,240
And I'll tell y'all about all my sin.

1355
00:58:24,680 --> 00:58:28,520
The first act is him admitting all of his worldly sin.

1356
00:58:29,160 --> 00:58:31,160
So by the end of the first act, you're like,

1357
00:58:31,880 --> 00:58:35,080
someone please send this old man to the ground.

1358
00:58:35,080 --> 00:58:36,760
Dippy tap him all the way.

1359
00:58:36,760 --> 00:58:37,640
Goodbye, sin.

1360
00:58:37,640 --> 00:58:39,880
Someone please find a fucking dog,

1361
00:58:39,880 --> 00:58:45,640
some hero dog, and go please fucking end this old sinful man.

1362
00:58:52,280 --> 00:58:53,880
So this has been My Brother, My Brother, Me.

1363
00:58:53,880 --> 00:58:54,840
It's an advice show.

1364
00:58:55,720 --> 00:58:56,360
We're helping.

1365
00:58:57,400 --> 00:58:58,600
This has all helped, hasn't it?

1366
00:58:58,600 --> 00:58:59,240
Yep.

1367
00:58:59,240 --> 00:59:00,200
I'm glad we could help.

1368
00:59:02,360 --> 00:59:05,400
We, we're done touring for the year.

1369
00:59:06,040 --> 00:59:08,120
So this is normally where we tell you to come see us,

1370
00:59:08,120 --> 00:59:11,080
but we're not gonna be out and about, sadly.

1371
00:59:11,800 --> 00:59:12,680
Yeah, for a bit now.

1372
00:59:12,680 --> 00:59:17,720
We're taking a bit of a break as Travis and Teresa are expecting.

1373
00:59:18,280 --> 00:59:21,560
And so we're just gonna kind of chill on it for, yeah.

1374
00:59:21,560 --> 00:59:23,080
Just gonna chill on it for a little bit.

1375
00:59:23,080 --> 00:59:24,520
But thanks to everybody who came out.

1376
00:59:25,400 --> 00:59:27,560
We got a bunch of stuff at McElroy.family

1377
00:59:27,560 --> 00:59:28,840
that you can check out,

1378
00:59:28,840 --> 00:59:31,720
even if it's not tickets for our live sort of performances.

1379
00:59:31,720 --> 00:59:36,200
So, you know, new stuff every month, throwing them up.

1380
00:59:36,200 --> 00:59:38,360
Got candle lights merch in there.

1381
00:59:38,360 --> 00:59:39,800
If you want candle lights merch,

1382
00:59:39,800 --> 00:59:43,960
got candles and pins and there's no candles,

1383
00:59:43,960 --> 00:59:45,160
but there's pictures of candles,

1384
00:59:45,960 --> 00:59:48,280
pins, ornaments, all kinds of fun stuff.

1385
00:59:48,280 --> 00:59:49,720
Speaking of new stuff,

1386
00:59:49,720 --> 00:59:52,920
you can go to TheAdventureZoneComic.com

1387
00:59:52,920 --> 00:59:54,040
if you haven't already,

1388
00:59:54,040 --> 00:59:57,720
and pre-order The Adventure Zone Balanced Graphic Novel,

1389
00:59:57,720 --> 01:00:00,600
book three, coming out in July.

1390
01:00:00,600 --> 01:00:01,800
But you can pre-order it now

1391
01:00:01,800 --> 01:00:03,480
and then not have to worry about it again.

1392
01:00:04,040 --> 01:00:05,720
Thanks to John Roderick and The Long Winters

1393
01:00:05,720 --> 01:00:06,680
for the use of our theme song.

1394
01:00:06,680 --> 01:00:09,160
It's a departure off the album, Putting the Days to Bed.

1395
01:00:09,160 --> 01:00:13,160
Great album, great tunes and great riffs on that one

1396
01:00:13,160 --> 01:00:14,680
and a super powerful chorus.

1397
01:00:15,320 --> 01:00:17,080
There's a few good choruses on there

1398
01:00:17,080 --> 01:00:19,720
and thanks to Maximum Fun for having us on the network

1399

Yes.

1404
01:00:31,800 --> 01:00:32,360
Yes.

1405
01:00:32,360 --> 01:00:33,240
