1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:30,640
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:47,360
Hello, everybody, and welcome to My Brother, My Brother, Me, and the Advice Show for the

6
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:51,840
modern era. I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy. I'm your middle-est brother, Travis

7
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:56,080
McElroy. I'm your sweet baby brother in 30 under 30 media luminary, Griffin.

8
00:00:56,080 --> 00:01:02,160
Justin, excuse me, everybody. I apologize for that, doing that right into the microphone.

9
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:06,240
I usually have better technique than that, but can you blame me? I've got Scoob fever.

10
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:13,360
Oh, God, these problems don't seem to be real until they affect someone that you care about.

11
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:15,920
And then it's time to really sound the alarm bells and get out there.

12
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:21,920
No sooner had we pretty much wrapped up the coronavirus thing.

13
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:24,880
At this point, it's we're on the tail end of it, aren't we?

14
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:28,880
Where it's wrapping up. This is like we're in the credit sequence for sure.

15
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:38,640
Just as coronavirus finally gets wrapped up, now our family has been stricken with,

16
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:44,640
well, just one member of our family has been stricken with a case of Scoob fever.

17
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:47,520
Oh, it's hitting me hard. And let me tell you the symptoms. One,

18
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:55,440
gotta need to have to sort of want to watch Scoob all day. Number two, I sneeze and it makes me do

19
00:01:55,440 --> 00:02:04,480
sound like Scooby-Doo or Scrappy-Doo, depending on the time of day. Number three, an itch,

20
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:11,520
a constant all body itch all over, but especially in my button privates.

21
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:18,160
I'll be honest with you, it's mostly the one to watch Scoob all day 24-7. Travis,

22
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:23,200
you had a question about my condition. Well, more comment, really.

23
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:30,960
I would say the bitter irony here is that Griffin has been afflicted with this malady,

24
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:38,880
but I actually just before we started recording got my test results back and I seem to be immune.

25
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:45,200
Oh, wow. So you think it's very rare that they're going to study me.

26
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:50,560
You think you did, maybe you did have Scoob fever and now you do have the antibodies built up. And

27
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:54,560
I don't know how that would happen. Maybe you saw a preview for it before Detective Pikachu

28
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:59,680
and you were like, I'm going to see that. You may have actually vaccinated yourself

29
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:07,040
with an inert, some of the inert virus antibodies. I watched a lot of a pup named Scooby-Doo

30
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:14,160
and the doctors are theorizing that that contains some of the dead Scoob virus.

31
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:16,880
Well, and you fucked Jabberjaw, didn't you, Travis?

32
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:22,960
Well, you fucked Jabberjaw, the cartoon shark from the Hanna-Barbera era.

33
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:29,440
Griffin, I made love with Jabberjaw, please. No, you made love to Grape Ape.

34
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:32,160
I would never, that's terrifying.

35
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:37,280
Fuck, kill, marry Jabberjaw, Grape Ape and Dick Dastardly.

36
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:39,680
I can't fuck Jabberjaw.

37
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:43,360
You would fuck Jabberjaw because you have fucked Jabberjaw. We've covered this.

38
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:49,120
I think I'd marry Grape Ape. He seems like a provider.

39
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:51,840
And you know why? Because I really want to kill Dick Dastardly.

40
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:54,640
Once and for all.

41
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:55,440
Someone needs to.

42
00:03:55,440 --> 00:04:01,280
We can't really talk about our feelings about the Scoob film

43
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:07,280
because our careers have taken so many twists at this point

44
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:13,200
that I have a not insignificant statistical chance of being in a room with people

45
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:18,480
that worked on this film at this point. So I can't actually talk that much about it.

46
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:22,160
But I will say one thing in the movie that is,

47
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:29,360
is that we meet the gang when they're kids and when Shaggy adopts Scooby,

48
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:38,800
he gives him a collar with the SD on it and he says, Scooby says, I'll never take it off.

49
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:42,240
Scooby's talking a lot in this one, by the way. I'm not loving it.

50
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:45,520
But he swears he'll never take it off.

51
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:49,760
There is a plot point another hour into the film, which is 10 years later,

52
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:54,400
where much is made, much ballyhoo is made of the fact that Scoob is,

53
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:57,520
in fact, taking off the collar for the first time.

54
00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:01,120
Hey, Shaggy, I don't think that's okay.

55
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:01,760
Yeah.

56
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:06,720
Just from a hygiene standpoint, I don't think that's great dog maintenance, I would say.

57
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:08,160
You gotta take that off from time.

58
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:13,200
You gotta do a deep sort of grout cleaning under there.

59
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:13,760
Get in there.

60
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:15,280
Just really get in there.

61
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:21,920
Now, boys, this is just a, let's just discuss the facts of Scoob.

62
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:22,560
I have not seen it.

63
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:23,120
All right.

64
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:23,440
Okay.

65
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:24,320
You both have.

66
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:24,720
Yeah.

67
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:25,040
I'm looking at-

68
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:26,000
Stellar cast.

69
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,040
Is that what you're about to ask?

70
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:27,280
Yeah, I am.

71
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:28,880
The cast is fucking stellar.

72
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:31,440
I'm looking at the IMDb cast list now.

73
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:32,960
Will Forte, Mark Wahlberg.

74
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:33,600
Oh, I know.

75
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:36,160
There goes my quiz show that I was about to do with you, Travis.

76
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:37,040
Let me ball it up.

77
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:38,080
Sorry.

78
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:39,040
Put it in the trash.

79
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:41,280
This is amazing Zac Efron, Gina Rodriguez.

80
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:45,200
You fucking know Justin loves Mark Wahlberg.

81
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:47,680
It's his first animated film, according to IMDb.

82
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:49,360
But here is my question.

83
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:49,760
Yeah.

84
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:54,240
Among the stellar cast is a listing for Simon Cowell as Simon Cowell.

85
00:05:55,040 --> 00:06:02,400
So do they finally, does someone finally do a send up of Simon Cowell and his whole like,

86
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:05,280
I don't think I like your performance, darling.

87
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:11,520
Travis, if I was to tell you that the action of the film,

88
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:17,280
the impetus of the action of the film is that Simon Cowell wants to invest in Mystery Inc.

89
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:23,520
But not if Shaggy and Scooby are attached, then you would think I am kidding you.

90
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:27,840
But no, that is the actual impetus of the action in the film.

91
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:29,760
They are looking to take on investors.

92
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:30,720
Oh boy.

93
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:34,640
Simon Cowell is interested, but does not trust Scooby and Shaggy.

94
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:39,040
I hate to disagree with you, Juice, but I would say the driving force behind the film

95
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:44,720
is the fact that Dick dastardly wants to open a portal to hell so he can kill Satan and become Satan.

96
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:47,600
So these are all real facts about Scoob.

97
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:49,920
Gotta watch this fucking movie, Trav.

98
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:51,440
You're gonna catch the thief.

99
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:52,560
Let's, can we do a question?

100
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:56,240
Hey, let's talk about, okay, Travis, one more thing I will say.

101
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:56,480
Okay.

102
00:06:56,480 --> 00:07:02,000
Of the Mystery Inc. gang, which one do you think gets trapped in literal hell,

103
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:06,080
sacrificing his soul for all eternity in this film?

104
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:07,040
Huh?

105
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:11,120
Who makes the decision to sacrifice their soul for all eternity?

106
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:17,520
You know, it seems to me like Shaggy would be the most sacrificial lamb of the gang.

107
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:21,040
So go on.

108
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:22,000
I'm gonna say Shaggy.

109
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:23,440
Interesting.

110
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:25,840
I can't answer that, but here's what I will say.

111
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:27,200
It's not Scooby.

112
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:35,840
And the problem I have with that is as one of the gang does this act of locking themselves in hell

113
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:43,360
forever so Scooby doesn't have to, and as Sidney pointed out so astutely as we watched the film,

114
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:47,440
Scooby is 10 years old at this point.

115
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:47,680
Yeah.

116
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:49,600
And a dog.

117
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:57,040
So it is, and the gang is in there like late teens.

118
00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:57,440
Yeah.

119
00:07:57,440 --> 00:07:57,760
Sure.

120
00:07:58,560 --> 00:07:58,800
Yeah.

121
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:02,960
I mean, that's grim, but come on, folks.

122
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:07,040
And he is a larger breed as a Great Dane, 10 is a long life.

123
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:08,640
Yeah, you hate to talk about that.

124
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:10,480
It's getting a little real in the studio.

125
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:12,160
You hate to talk about it.

126
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:13,600
All right, let's move on.

127
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:16,400
But you would think, is there a point in the discussion, Justin,

128
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:19,440
when they're maybe debating who will lock themselves in hell?

129
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:24,240
And does anybody, and I'm looking at Daphne here, say he is a dog.

130
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:26,240
He's an old, big breed.

131
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:27,040
Let's-

132
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:32,880
I don't know that maybe his soul is as important as our human soul.

133
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:35,840
It's like a quarter of a human soul, I know.

134
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:38,400
But we can, you know, the devil's not too discerning.

135
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:41,040
Juice, read that first question maybe.

136
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:42,720
Hello, brothers.

137
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:43,040
Hello.

138
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:46,000
I've gotten into beekeeping and I love to spread the word about

139
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,400
saving these lovely ladies and what people can do to help.

140
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:53,360
The problem is I'm often patronized and called cute and adorable

141
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:54,640
when I tell my new friends.

142
00:08:54,640 --> 00:09:00,000
Just seeing what I do as a quirky trait and not taking me or my hobby seriously.

143
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,520
How can I make people understand and take my passion of saving the bees seriously

144
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:07,680
or make beekeeping seem cooler and saving the bees badass?

145
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:09,040
Thank you for your time.

146
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:11,440
Beekeeper Blues in Texas.

147
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:13,920
Let's get down to bee-sness.

148
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:14,880
Fuck.

149
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:19,440
I think that it should be-

150
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:22,720
I think it would be easy to carry around like one pamphlet

151
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:26,960
that is like why we needs beads.

152
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:28,640
Uh-huh.

153
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:31,440
And hand those out to people when they laugh at you and they're like,

154
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:32,080
bees aren't-

155
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:35,920
Anybody who says bees aren't important right now isn't paying attention.

156
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:39,120
Now, I will admit, I don't really know exactly why bees are important,

157
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:40,080
but I think it's because they-

158
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:43,040
It's something about the circle of life.

159
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:46,880
Like bears eat honey and we need the bears to kill-

160
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:48,960
To keep the coyote population in check.

161
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:49,200
Yep.

162
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:51,840
Something, something, something.

163
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:53,840
The coyotes keep the bees in check.

164
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:54,720
That's the cycle.

165
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:57,120
That's- It's more of a triangle of life.

166
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:58,880
It's just bees, bears, and coyote.

167
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:02,240
So that is-

168
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:06,000
Man, I feel like I've never looked at somebody covered in bees in a beekeeping suit

169
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:10,240
like surrounded by these like delightful, venomous insects

170
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:11,840
and been like, that's cute.

171
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:13,840
It's always been like, wow, that's-

172
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:15,440
They're doing a scary thing, huh?

173
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:16,080
They're brave.

174
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:16,880
I think it's more-

175
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:21,280
I think it's more of like, if you say like, we need to save the bees,

176
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:24,640
people see that and like, oh, that's cute, right?

177
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:26,800
But I think that the thing is, I think we can all agree,

178
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,800
and we're just on three gonna say it, in cinema,

179
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:34,240
the coolest, we need to go save somebody

180
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:37,040
and we're gonna prep for it seen in any movie.

181
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:38,080
What's the movie, guys?

182
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:38,880
One, two, three.

183
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:40,800
The Matrix.

184
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:42,640
Independence Matrix.

185
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:43,440
Sorry, there's a lag.

186
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:43,920
The Matrix.

187
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:45,120
I said it at the same time as you.

188
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:47,200
They get all those cool shelves of guns.

189
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:48,560
They go flying past them.

190
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:49,600
They get the big bag.

191
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:50,080
It's cool.

192
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:50,640
It's cool.

193
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:52,160
Maybe more one of those moments,

194
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:54,720
if you meet a new friend, you kick open the door

195
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:56,800
and you come in, you've got one of those things

196
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:59,360
that beekeepers use that sprays smoke

197
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:01,040
to make the bees sleepy.

198
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:03,680
And you bust in the door and you flip up your mask and like,

199
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:05,040
it's trying to save the bee!

200
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:07,440
And you make it seem a lot more urgent.

201
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:08,160
That's good.

202
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:13,760
Saving the bees is not a passive action that we can take.

203
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:16,320
It is, in fact, an active action

204
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:18,320
that somewhere there's a bee in trouble

205
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:21,200
and you need to go save that bee.

206
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:21,840
One bee?

207
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:22,560
Just one bee?

208
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:25,520
Well, you start with one bee, Griffin.

209
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:27,040
Listen, if you could save,

210
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:29,760
if you go out there today and you could save just one bee.

211
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:31,120
I wouldn't, probably.

212
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:31,760
It's not enough.

213
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:32,240
Oh.

214
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:33,920
No, and listen, I don't want to make it sound

215
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:35,920
like I don't love these bees and value them

216
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:37,840
and hate coyotes and I'm scared of them.

217
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:38,800
So I need these bees.

218
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:40,000
Like, I recognize that.

219
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:42,160
But one bee?

220
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:45,280
How many bees do you think you need to save

221
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:46,880
for it to be worth it, to be like a good day?

222
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:47,760
How far am I going?

223
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:50,080
Am I going like out in the street, out in my front?

224
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:52,400
Like, I don't want to break that quar.

225
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:55,920
So like, if it's just out in my front yard,

226
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:58,720
yeah, I'd probably do one bee for my front yard.

227
00:11:58,720 --> 00:11:59,680
You'd do one bee?

228
00:11:59,680 --> 00:11:59,840
Yeah.

229
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:01,440
But if it's not going to feel like a full day,

230
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:04,880
would you be like, I'm going to go to bed early today?

231
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:06,160
I wouldn't go to bed.

232
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:08,000
It's fucking 11, 54 a.m.

233
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
I wouldn't go outside, save one bee and be like,

234
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,240
time to call it.

235
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:12,560
No.

236
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:13,440
Well, that's what I was asking.

237
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:17,840
But what if you save like 1,000 bees in the next 10 minutes?

238
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:19,600
Can I say something though?

239
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:20,960
Yeah.

240
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:23,600
I don't think I want to save 1,000 bees either.

241
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:25,760
Because I love bees and I want to save them.

242
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:30,400
And I want them to be like cool and spreading flower juice

243
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:31,600
and all that stuff.

244
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:35,440
But I don't want 1,000 bees near me and uncontained.

245
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:37,280
Like, if I was a beekeeper and I had a little hive

246
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:39,920
or one of those cool boxes, like, cool.

247
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:40,800
1,000 bees love it.

248
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:43,440
But like, I don't necessarily know I want 1,000 bees

249
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:44,080
in my neighborhood.

250
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:45,840
I would want to spread them out.

251
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:48,080
Well, do you think that bee smoker gas

252
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:49,440
would get you fucked up?

253
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:49,920
Oh, yeah.

254
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:52,160
I mean, that's what it does to bees, right?

255
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:54,880
Yeah, it smokes them out.

256
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:56,080
Yeah, it smokes them out.

257
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:59,360
Do you think your friends might get into it

258
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:04,000
if you also smoke them out while you smoked your bees out?

259
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:04,720
You bombed it.

260
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:09,760
Yeah, let's get faded with our black and yellow friends here.

261
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:11,760
And we'll listen to some Blind Melon.

262
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:14,080
Loving this, Travis.

263
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:14,800
Good.

264
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:15,280
Good, Travis.

265
00:13:15,280 --> 00:13:16,080
Good, Travis.

266
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:18,960
Everybody give Travis the award now.

267
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:21,680
Travis, there should be a certificate printing out

268
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:22,880
from your computer.

269
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:26,000
And Travis, we got all the listeners to sign it

270
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,120
for your good book.

271
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:29,040
There's only five names on here.

272
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:31,520
Yeah, they all stopped listening after that joke

273
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:33,280
because they figured that was the series finale.

274
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:34,480
Oh, okay, yeah.

275
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:35,520
Let me ask you guys this.

276
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:36,880
Let me posit something to you.

277
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:39,360
The only ones left are just writing fan fiction

278
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:42,080
extended universe My Brother, My Brother and Me episodes.

279
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:46,320
Someone walks up to you observing six foot quarantine,

280
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:48,080
of course, and says,

281
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:51,360
hey, I'm on my way to go kill a thousand bees.

282
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:55,360
And if you let me do that, I'll give you a hundred dollar bill.

283
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:56,480
Would you let them?

284
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:57,360
No, no, no.

285
00:13:58,240 --> 00:13:58,560
Okay.

286
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:01,440
No, cause I could sell a hundred bees on the internet

287
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:02,880
for more or a thousand bees on the internet

288
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:04,000
for more than a hundred bucks.

289
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:04,480
You know what I mean?

290
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:06,960
They're not giving you the thousand bees, Griffin.

291
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:08,960
They're just telling you somewhere in the world,

292
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:11,200
they knew where a thousand bees were

293
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:13,360
and they were gonna go take them out.

294
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:16,400
Yeah, no, I would ask them where the thousand bees are

295
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:17,760
and then I would push them down

296
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:20,320
and run much faster than them to capture the bees myself.

297
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:21,520
And then I could sell them on the internet

298
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:22,640
for more than a hundred dollars.

299
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:24,880
See, it was a trick.

300
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:26,000
There were no bees.

301
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:29,440
This was like a what would you do kind of situation.

302
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:33,840
Okay, well, John Quinones, you now know what I would do

303
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:36,480
is I would push them so fiercely over

304
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:38,880
so that I could sell these thousand bees on the internet.

305
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:42,080
But if you had just taken the bees and not the money,

306
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:43,840
I was gonna give you a thousand dollars.

307
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:46,320
The fuck am I gonna do with a thousand bees?

308
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:47,520
Like in my life.

309
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:49,920
You're not gonna have the bees, Griffin.

310
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:51,600
There were no bees.

311
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:54,960
The bees were a ruse to see if you were a good person.

312
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:56,720
Hey Griff, can I have some of your bees?

313
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:57,360
How many do you want?

314
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:57,860
Jesus.

315
00:14:58,480 --> 00:14:58,640
What?

316
00:14:58,640 --> 00:14:59,680
Travis, you're not a part,

317
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:01,520
if this is the energy you're gonna bring,

318
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:04,560
Trav, you're not invited to my bee distribution party,

319
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:05,680
my bee Tupperware party.

320
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:06,960
Justin, how many bees you need, bud?

321
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:10,800
17 should cover me just for right now.

322
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:11,360
17, huh?

323
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:14,000
We talking normalies?

324
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:14,560
We talking drones?

325
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:15,360
I want choice cuts.

326
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:16,400
I want choice cuts.

327
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:19,600
Okay, but do we want drones or workers or warriors or,

328
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:20,560
I'm not giving you my queen.

329
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:21,040
Like that's-

330
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:22,400
I'm not trying to get all your queen.

331
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:22,880
No, no, no.

332
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:25,040
But like, do you want my drones or my warriors or my-

333
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:28,560
Just, if you could give me three wizards, four druids,

334
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:31,520
and the rest just like barbarians or whatever.

335
00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:32,960
Now, do you want, if you want,

336
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:35,760
I can do, if you kick that price up a little bit,

337
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:36,560
we haven't talked price,

338
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:38,400
but I know if you kick it up a little bit,

339
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:40,000
you will afford a stud.

340
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
I do have one stud bee, and this one-

341
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:43,680
What's his name?

342
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:45,680
Cause I'm actually kind of superstitious.

343
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:48,720
His name is Chester Big Sting,

344
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:51,840
and this dude fucks like it's his job,

345
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:58,000
and he can get the, I guess, make the queen's eggs grow faster

346
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,120
or make more of them.

347
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:00,640
Hey Griffin, sorry to interrupt.

348
00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:02,880
Whatever Justin offers you for Chester Big Sting,

349
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:03,920
I'll double it.

350
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:06,080
Well, it would feel weird to sell Chester Big Sting

351
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:09,120
by himself without a bunch of other sort of bees

352
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:10,720
that you can really lay the pipe on.

353
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:12,000
I'll take 60 of your bees.

354
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:14,560
60 and Chester Big Sting?

355
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:15,200
Yeah.

356
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:15,760
Travis, that's like-

357
00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:16,880
Name your price.

358
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:18,160
That's like 12 bucks, man.

359
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:19,520
Oh shit.

360
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:21,040
Will you take 11?

361
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:24,960
Yeah, yeah, I'll take 11.

362
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:27,760
I can't believe you're letting him salt my deal

363
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:30,320
after he was foolish enough

364
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:31,680
to let these bees get away in the first place.

365
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:34,560
I didn't realize it was a seller's market, Justin.

366
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:35,600
Justin, the joke's on him.

367
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:36,880
I'm just going to send them to him

368
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:39,920
in one big sort of manila envelope.

369
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:42,640
There's no way these bees are going to survive that trip, man.

370
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:47,280
Do you guys want a yahoo?

371
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:49,360
It was a honeypot.

372
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:49,920
That's funny.

373
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:52,880
Justin, check your printer.

374
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:54,960
Everybody's getting certificates, baby.

375
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:57,920
You know what's weird is it actually,

376
00:16:57,920 --> 00:17:00,640
my printer is actually functioning right now.

377
00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:03,200
It's actually operating, and I don't know why

378
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:06,080
because it doesn't really work.

379
00:17:06,080 --> 00:17:07,280
It's not plugged in.

380
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:08,160
It's not plugged in.

381
00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:10,000
No, it is plugged in.

382
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,360
It's just no one ever prints anything.

383
00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:12,960
But for some reason, there's something printing.

384
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:16,000
Why is my wife printing behind my back?

385
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,600
That is what I need to know right now.

386
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:19,840
Or have my kids learn to print off YouTube.

387
00:17:19,840 --> 00:17:22,240
I think it is for printing out YouTube flip books.

388
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:23,520
They're probably just printing out

389
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:25,360
really rude comments about you.

390
00:17:26,080 --> 00:17:27,280
See you later, cyan.

391
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:30,960
Oh, my fucking cyan magenta is gone.

392
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:32,480
How come it's-

393
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:33,760
Hey, printer manufacturers,

394
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:35,280
can we just call it blue and yellow?

395
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:36,400
Thank you.

396
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:38,560
Well, I mean, yellow is the other one.

397
00:17:38,560 --> 00:17:39,120
And red.

398
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:39,600
Yellow is the other one.

399
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:40,800
I think that's kind of fucked up.

400
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:42,960
That cyan and magenta get to be these special,

401
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:44,880
but it's not like and goldenrod.

402
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:47,600
So this hasn't been funny for a little while.

403
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:48,400
So let's do a yahoo.

404
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:49,760
This one was sent in by Mike,

405
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:51,680
and it's an anonymous yahoo answers user

406
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:57,360
who I'm going to call boom shkadoow asks,

407
00:17:57,360 --> 00:17:59,760
why is Mono Lisa so popular?

408
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:00,960
My nephew could paint it.

409
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:02,400
Huh?

410
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:06,880
No one's ever talked so much about Mono Lisa.

411
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:09,520
Just one of them.

412
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:12,320
Just the one, not stereo Lisa.

413
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:14,240
I prefer stereo Lisa myself.

414
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:15,760
I got in there before you did.

415
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:22,240
So that one's going to be tricky to edit, that joke.

416
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:26,880
But it is just a painting of a sort of like

417
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:30,080
somewhat pleased lady,

418
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:32,560
just kind of sitting on a chair.

419
00:18:32,560 --> 00:18:33,840
And what's in the background of Mono-

420
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:36,560
Without looking, what's in the background of Mono Lisa?

421
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:37,760
A field?

422
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:38,720
I want to say it's a field.

423
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:40,000
Justin, I hear you typing.

424
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:42,720
Somehow, no, I'm not typing about that.

425
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:44,000
I'm doing other work.

426
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:44,480
Oh, cool.

427
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:46,880
Cool, then let's stop doing the fucking question.

428
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:48,320
And Justin, you unpack what kind of work

429
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:49,440
you're doing right now, bud.

430
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:51,520
You work on that spec script for young Sheldon

431
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:53,440
that you've been talking about for so long?

432
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:56,240
No, one of my kids has diarrhea and I was just-

433
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:58,640
You were working on the diarrhea via your computer?

434
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:01,680
You were typing into your science application

435
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:03,600
trying to find a cure for diarrhea finally.

436
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:06,080
He did and he cracked it.

437
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:09,200
You were punching code into your diarrhea fixing app

438
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:12,240
and it was updating the algorithms.

439
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:14,160
It's like a city, right?

440
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:15,280
We're all guessing, right?

441
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:17,760
I feel like I want to say like columns on a hill.

442
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:19,520
I want to say it's a garden seen through

443
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:22,880
like an alabaster window.

444
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:23,360
I'm going to look.

445
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:23,840
Can we all guess?

446
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:24,960
I'm going to look, yeah.

447
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:25,680
Now let's look.

448
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:29,120
Fuck, you know what?

449
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:29,760
What?

450
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:30,800
It's a map.

451
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:31,360
It's a map?

452
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:31,680
Yeah.

453
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:33,280
Oh, it's a secret map.

454
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:33,680
Hold up.

455
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:34,560
A secret map.

456
00:19:34,560 --> 00:19:35,520
Griffin, are you not seeing this?

457
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:37,120
Hold the fucking phone.

458
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:40,320
Travis, what are you seeing in the map?

459
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:45,440
I see there's a pathway, there's a mountain in the back across the river.

460
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:47,600
Yes, absolutely.

461
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:51,920
Okay, and you see the eagle there with the three arrows in its claw.

462
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:53,200
Wait, what are those talons?

463
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:54,640
Yeah, yeah.

464
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:55,840
Griff, what do you see?

465
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:57,520
Travis, what else?

466
00:19:57,520 --> 00:20:01,120
Oh, down here in the corner, it does say X equals three.

467
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:01,520
I don't know.

468
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:02,320
X equals three.

469
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:03,920
Griff, are you seeing anything on your map?

470
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:04,960
Oh, yeah, man.

471
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:06,080
Mine is a funny mystery.

472
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:08,000
There's a bridge.

473
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,880
No, fuck.

474
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:11,680
No, I'm not seeing that.

475
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:12,320
You don't see the bridge.

476
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:13,200
No bridge.

477
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:14,640
Travis, you don't see a bridge, do you?

478
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:15,840
No, I see a wormhole.

479
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:16,960
No, Griff.

480
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:18,400
Yeah, okay, I got the wormhole.

481
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:19,280
I got the wormhole.

482
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:19,840
Griff, do you...

483
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:21,280
Griff, are you seeing anything else in there?

484
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:22,880
Yeah, I see a really silly clue.

485
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:23,920
No.

486
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:29,120
No, I don't have that on mine.

487
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:29,680
I have the...

488
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:31,760
Travis, I'm seeing your wormhole for sure.

489
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:32,400
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

490
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:33,200
Oh my god, I'm in it.

491
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:34,000
And the X equals three.

492
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:36,320
Okay, yeah, I see you.

493
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:37,360
I'm walking down the road.

494
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:38,080
I'm moving.

495
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:39,520
I see you.

496
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:40,560
Griffin, do you see yourself?

497
00:20:40,560 --> 00:20:41,680
Mona Lisa's a GIF.

498
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:43,360
Griffin, do you see yourself?

499
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:45,360
I don't know.

500
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:46,080
You're on there.

501
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:47,520
You're actually very prominent.

502
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:50,160
You're doing jumping jacks and you look really cool doing it.

503
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:52,000
Yeah, jumping jacks, looking cool.

504
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:52,720
So I'm moving the...

505
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:56,720
I didn't know that Mona Lisa had movement.

506
00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:57,440
Okay.

507
00:20:57,440 --> 00:21:00,080
Yeah, the one I'm looking at is moving.

508
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:00,560
That's why it's so famous.

509
00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:03,200
Griff, do you see any other things that could be clues on the map?

510
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:05,680
I want to make sure you have the right map that Travis and I have found.

511
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:08,400
I see a calendar and I know everybody says...

512
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:09,280
No, no, no, no, no.

513
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:09,600
There's no...

514
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:11,680
Oh man, I sure would like to play along in this bit.

515
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:15,520
I have funny jokes too, but I guess I'll...

516
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:17,280
You gotta keep...

517
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:20,160
I just want you to find the right map because Travis and I are on it.

518
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:21,280
We're finding this map.

519
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:21,600
Right, right.

520
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:25,760
Oh, I wasn't looking at the right Mona Lisa.

521
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:26,240
I think...

522
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:28,560
Okay, now I see all the great shit you guys have been talking about.

523
00:21:28,560 --> 00:21:30,880
The eagle, the wormhole, all that stuff.

524
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:32,480
Okay, good.

525
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:34,000
The Kathy cartoon.

526
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:37,200
Yeah, the calendar that says 9-11 on it.

527
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:37,920
Whoa, hold on.

528
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:42,560
I still don't see the calendar.

529
00:21:42,560 --> 00:21:47,840
Oh no, actually now I see the calendar, but it does say 9-11-2002, so well.

530
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:51,280
Okay, that's when Shrek 3 came out.

531
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:52,560
So maybe we've got...

532
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:52,880
Is that true?

533
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:56,640
Oh wait, was Mona Lisa just like native advertising for Shrek 3?

534
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:58,960
Anything's possible.

535
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:03,760
This painting, I do feel like...

536
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:04,480
It's fine.

537
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:09,280
You guys are the only ones with a nephew because of my powerful seed.

538
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:13,920
I do feel like he could take a swing at this though,

539
00:22:13,920 --> 00:22:17,600
because it is just a lady sitting in front of this incredible map.

540
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:21,520
And not even like the full lady, and legs are the hardest part.

541
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:23,600
That's true, legs and feet are super tough.

542
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:26,880
Hands are like, a chump could draw these hands.

543
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:29,200
The legs are in the sequel.

544
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:30,400
It's hanging below.

545
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:31,040
Yeah.

546
00:22:31,040 --> 00:22:31,840
That sounds cool.

547
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:33,600
Yeah, it's funny.

548
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:34,480
It's funny to think about.

549
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:35,920
The background is really pretty,

550
00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:40,320
and it kind of looks like Mona Lisa got in the way of a really cool background he was painting.

551
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:43,040
Can you please move, please?

552
00:22:43,040 --> 00:22:43,760
She was like, no, I just got comfortable.

553
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:45,360
I'm painting this beautiful garden.

554
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:50,400
Or maybe there's like a horse there in the middle, and he sucks ass at horses.

555
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:52,320
Like I never could do a horse.

556
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:55,200
So if you could please stand there, perfect, yes.

557
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:57,440
Absolutely.

558
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,040
Here's another question.

559
00:22:59,040 --> 00:23:02,400
At a bonfire at a friend's house last summer,

560
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:05,920
I noticed that one of the beach towels they had laid out on the chairs

561
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:08,720
eerily resembled a beach towel my family used to own.

562
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:11,600
I can't get it out of my head that it's the same towel.

563
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:14,960
Is there any way I can try to reclaim the towel,

564
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:18,480
or even ask about the towel without sounding like a towel obsessed creep?

565
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:21,280
Maybe she stole it from me when we were 10,

566
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:24,240
or maybe her mom got it at Costco or whatever.

567
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:26,480
But it's a good towel, and I want it back.

568
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:31,280
And if she did steal it, is there an expiration date on towel theft?

569
00:23:31,920 --> 00:23:35,600
I think they probably don't mean expiration date.

570
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:37,680
That's not the legal term, I think.

571
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:39,200
Statue of limitations.

572
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:45,440
I was going to arrest you for murder, but it does say best by 10-22-2019.

573
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:46,320
Ah, dang.

574
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:50,240
Beach towel burgled in BC, British Columbia.

575
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:50,740
Yep.

576
00:23:51,920 --> 00:23:53,200
The thing is, is there is a line-

577
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:54,240
Beautiful country up there.

578
00:23:54,240 --> 00:24:00,880
A line of questions here that if you went even one step too far,

579
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:03,600
you're going to seem like a bonkers person.

580
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:06,400
Yeah, I would say one step too far is the literal

581
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:10,320
first step you might take in trying to retrieve this towel

582
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:11,920
that you think your family used to own.

583
00:24:11,920 --> 00:24:13,440
That's true, because even if you said,

584
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:15,760
that's a great towel, and they're just like,

585
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:19,040
this is like an old ratty towel that we've had for 10 years.

586
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:20,160
What are you talking about?

587
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:22,720
Yeah, there's lots of great towels out there.

588
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:26,000
And if you hit me up on my Twitter DMs,

589
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:30,160
I'll send you on your way towards Towel City.

590
00:24:30,160 --> 00:24:35,760
But maybe this towel has deep emotional significance.

591
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:38,080
Yeah, that was my fear as well.

592
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:44,320
I remember having this when I saw an old picture from a friend's house,

593
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:50,720
and they had this blanket on a couch in the background

594
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:59,120
that was a brown and tannish sort of very intimidating large tiger design.

595
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:02,480
And then I remembered like, hey, that's my fucking blanket.

596
00:25:03,040 --> 00:25:08,320
And then I realized that this blanket was actually a very common blanket.

597
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:12,400
I'm hoping I'm sending people down a well right now.

598
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:13,280
I did just Google it.

599
00:25:13,280 --> 00:25:14,880
It's the Biederlach blanket.

600
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:19,040
They are a company who made all kinds of just sort of big cat designs.

601
00:25:19,040 --> 00:25:21,680
And we also had a bear, I believe.

602
00:25:21,680 --> 00:25:23,280
Yeah, probably from the same company.

603
00:25:23,280 --> 00:25:26,960
And I remember seeing that and I had like a full like panic.

604
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:28,080
Like, what the fuck?

605
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:31,440
Did you steal our incredible tiger blanket without realizing like,

606
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:34,480
nah, there was a period where lots of people thought like,

607
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:36,880
you know what would go really well with my living room?

608
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:39,200
A very large intimidating jungle cat.

609
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:42,960
So that's possibly what has happened here as well.

610
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:51,760
So here in our home, all of our towels are on some scale of like white, gray, dark gray,

611
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:53,200
that kind of thing, right?

612
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:58,720
There's this one towel that is a different size than any other towel we have.

613
00:25:58,720 --> 00:25:59,840
And it's a dark blue.

614
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:04,160
And neither Teresa nor I know where it came from.

615
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:06,160
And the only thing-

616
00:26:06,160 --> 00:26:06,720
That's a problem.

617
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:11,440
Yeah, the only thing I can assume is that somebody came to visit our home

618
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:15,440
and brought their own towel and left it?

619
00:26:16,160 --> 00:26:16,480
Guys.

620
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:19,040
Yes.

621
00:26:19,040 --> 00:26:21,520
I can't with these fucking tiger blankets.

622
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:22,720
I'm looking at this.

623
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:25,760
Guys, I want you to go on this trip with me.

624
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:26,880
And this is a visual trip,

625
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:31,680
but maybe we can just sort of like explain it to the squad at home.

626
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:34,960
Just like, these are big ass blankets.

627
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:35,280
We're talking-

628
00:26:35,280 --> 00:26:36,640
Give me the username one more time.

629
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:39,120
The manufacturer.

630
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:42,240
Biederlack, B-I-E-D-E-R-L-A-C-K.

631
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:45,280
These are blankets that we have multiple of in our house.

632
00:26:45,280 --> 00:26:46,960
And I think lots of people did too.

633
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:54,320
And these are the biggest, most noble, most proud, most strong jungle cats

634
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:55,920
that your mind could possibly-

635
00:26:55,920 --> 00:26:59,040
Imagine the most proud and noble jungle cat you could possibly-

636
00:26:59,040 --> 00:27:02,720
No, this big blanket that I guess we would wrap ourselves up in

637
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:09,200
to feel the big cat's strength was such a common thing.

638
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:12,560
These big, powerful, powerful kitties.

639
00:27:12,560 --> 00:27:13,920
I'm now torn looking at it.

640
00:27:13,920 --> 00:27:14,960
So I want you guys to weigh in.

641
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:16,880
There's two that seem very familiar to me.

642
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:21,920
And one is kind of like a tiger's, it's like the tiger's head.

643
00:27:21,920 --> 00:27:23,040
It's like a bust of the tiger.

644
00:27:23,040 --> 00:27:24,880
It's just the bust of the tiger, yes.

645
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:28,960
That reminds me a lot of like the Cave of Wonders from Aladdin.

646
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:31,440
That's very much the energy he's putting out.

647
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:34,000
And then there's also one where the tiger,

648
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,800
it looks like they're kind of walking towards the viewer.

649
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:37,360
Like they're about to fuck you up.

650
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:38,960
And maybe they're really surprised you're there.

651
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:40,000
Oh, they look so-

652
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,320
Their eyes are wide and they're about to fuck you up.

653
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:44,640
So let's put that on the couch in the den.

654
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:46,800
Their mouth is kind of going, uh.

655
00:27:47,680 --> 00:27:53,200
So let's put that in the little boy's bedroom to scare him so terribly.

656
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:55,280
Or maybe that was it.

657
00:27:55,280 --> 00:27:58,400
I'm afraid of zombies because we just played a scary video game.

658
00:27:58,400 --> 00:28:00,400
Well, get under the tiger blanket.

659
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:02,640
No undead creep is going to try and get you

660
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:04,720
when this big powerful jungle cat's on you.

661
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:06,160
Is that the one we had though?

662
00:28:06,160 --> 00:28:07,600
Which one is the one we had?

663
00:28:08,160 --> 00:28:11,200
It doesn't, that part doesn't matter.

664
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:16,960
All that matters is that now all I want is a huge sinewy beast.

665
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:18,880
They did do horse blankets as well,

666
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:22,640
which I also specifically remember, I believe the one of two.

667
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:28,960
Is this the Rosetta Stone for like the entire, our entire sort of deal?

668
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:32,320
It might be, oh no, that was the one we had.

669
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:34,960
It was a, it looks like a mom and a colt.

670
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:36,480
I'm going to order one of these.

671
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:37,280
I'm going to buy one of these powerful blankets.

672
00:28:37,280 --> 00:28:39,680
Yeah, these are fucking so inspiring.

673
00:28:39,680 --> 00:28:40,800
So anyway-

674
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:48,000
Do you think it was our mom or our dad who saw the blanket with a tiger on it?

675
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,960
They're like, hey honey, this fucking wolf.

676
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:52,880
Kind of really seems like a dad move.

677
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:56,880
It seems like a dad move, but I don't know dad to be like a tiger.

678
00:28:56,880 --> 00:28:58,800
Or a blanket man.

679
00:28:58,800 --> 00:29:02,080
But mom's whole style was more like a country kitchen

680
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:03,520
and here's like some red apples.

681
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:04,000
You know what?

682
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:07,120
We got to get him on the horn.

683
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:08,400
We got to figure this out.

684
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:10,160
Yeah, let's call dad about this big blanket.

685
00:29:10,160 --> 00:29:11,200
I'm going to call dad real quick.

686
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:14,240
Hold on a sec.

687
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:16,880
I'm going to text out a picture of the blanket too,

688
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:24,480
because I know his old mind is just a little gooey around the edges.

689
00:29:25,040 --> 00:29:26,080
Little gooey.

690
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:29,600
Boy, dad's going to be so confused when I send him this picture of a tiger without contact.

691
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:31,600
What if he sees it?

692
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:33,040
It's like, that's a cool blanket.

693
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:34,960
Oh, that would be a good test.

694
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:36,320
We wouldn't even need to get him on the call.

695
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:40,000
I just sent it to him and asked him, what's that do for you?

696
00:29:44,560 --> 00:29:45,280
Dad.

697
00:29:45,280 --> 00:29:45,600
Yes?

698
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:47,760
There's no time.

699
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:50,640
The tiger blanket that we had at our house.

700
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:52,320
Do you remember the tiger blanket?

701
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:54,640
I remember the tiger blanket very well, yes.

702
00:29:54,640 --> 00:30:00,880
How the hell, sorry, Carol, did the tiger blanket get into the house?

703
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:02,480
How did it make its entryway?

704
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:06,480
We have theories that you bought it because you thought it looked rad.

705
00:30:07,040 --> 00:30:10,640
My actual one that I'm going to sneak in there is maybe it was a nonny gift.

706
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:14,480
That is actually feeling kind of powerful to me now that I said it out loud.

707
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:17,120
How did the tiger blanket arrive into our lives?

708
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:22,720
You are correct about nonny.

709
00:30:23,920 --> 00:30:24,400
Fuck yes.

710
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:25,600
That does feel right.

711
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:27,520
There's more to it than that.

712
00:30:28,800 --> 00:30:32,960
You burned it and then you had to buy a new one because you're afraid she'd find out.

713
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:40,400
No, she got it because I went to high school, which was the fighting tigers.

714
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:42,720
Okay, that was the last clue.

715
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:44,480
That was the last piece of the puzzle.

716
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:44,800
Okay.

717
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:47,920
One time nonny sent us lunch meat coasters.

718
00:30:47,920 --> 00:30:49,680
I feel like we've talked about nonny gifts before.

719
00:30:49,680 --> 00:30:54,800
Scented, scented lunch meat coasters that smelled like the lunch meat itself.

720
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:55,760
Yes.

721
00:30:56,800 --> 00:30:57,360
Painis.

722
00:30:57,360 --> 00:30:57,600
Okay.

723
00:30:58,560 --> 00:31:00,160
Hey dad, thank you so much, bud.

724
00:31:00,160 --> 00:31:00,640
Thank you.

725
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:02,160
Bye.

726
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:03,600
Okay, he's gone.

727
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:06,160
That was fascinating.

728
00:31:07,280 --> 00:31:08,720
That was like our cereal.

729
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:10,720
That was our cereal, yeah.

730
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:13,200
And we solved it way quicker than they did.

731
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:14,720
Take that, Ace.

732
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:18,240
It says daddy has gone away on the call and that makes me really sad.

733
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:19,920
Oh boy.

734
00:31:19,920 --> 00:31:23,120
Okay, let's cheer ourselves up with some money.

735
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:37,440
Did you list him as daddy in the clean feed link?

736
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:39,120
Okay, so this is fun.

737
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:41,680
We're using a sort of new software to talk to each other.

738
00:31:41,680 --> 00:31:47,520
Maybe you've heard an incredible, remarkable increase in the quality of the show

739
00:31:47,520 --> 00:31:53,280
since we switched over, but I see you do have me listed as DaGooch here.

740
00:31:53,280 --> 00:31:57,680
You picked the name DaGooch for me when you added me to this session.

741
00:31:57,680 --> 00:31:58,240
I was wondering-

742
00:31:58,240 --> 00:32:00,080
When I add people, I can assign them whatever name I want.

743
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:03,680
Yeah, so I'm wondering what is, like I'm a professional-

744
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:04,960
Yeah.

745
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:05,360
And you-

746
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:06,720
Well, I got Travis head as Trunk.

747
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:09,520
I don't care for that.

748
00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:11,920
Trunk with an M, Trump.

749
00:32:11,920 --> 00:32:13,040
Trunk, okay.

750
00:32:13,040 --> 00:32:14,080
And I'm DaGooch.

751
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:17,200
And I do see you're listed as Justin McElroy.

752
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:22,960
I don't have anybody to come up with a fun nickname for me.

753
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:28,160
Okay, well, next time hit me up and maybe we'll come up with some other fun garbage words

754
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:29,840
that are insulting to your adulthood.

755
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:32,000
Okay, DaGooch.

756
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:33,280
Can you read our first ad?

757
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:33,840
Yeah, sure.

758
00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:36,640
Here come DaGooch to read your new advertisement.

759
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:37,840
I love it when he says it.

760
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:41,760
Yeah, his trademark phrase.

761
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:45,200
Here come DaGooch to tell you about DoorDash.

762
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:49,680
They specifically requested DaGooch to sound off on this one.

763
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:56,400
DoorDash is going to get you there with food to your door from restaurants.

764
00:32:57,200 --> 00:33:00,960
Whatever you're craving, right now you can get it at your door with DoorDash.

765
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:02,800
It's easy as heck to order.

766
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:05,120
You just open up the DoorDash app, you choose what you want to eat,

767
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:07,360
your food will be left safely outside your door

768
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:11,680
with a contactless delivery drop-off setting.

769
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:15,280
A lot of your local restaurants that maybe you're not able to get into right now

770
00:33:15,280 --> 00:33:22,080
or you're not going to trying to respect social distancing guidelines,

771
00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:23,520
you can still get delivery from them.

772
00:33:23,520 --> 00:33:26,720
If you go open your DoorDash app, you pick your favorite local restaurant,

773
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:29,280
your food will just get dropped off right there at your dang door.

774
00:33:29,280 --> 00:33:32,560
And right now listeners can get five bucks off their first order of $15 or more

775
00:33:32,560 --> 00:33:35,520
and zero delivery fees for the first month when you download the DoorDash app

776
00:33:35,520 --> 00:33:38,800
and into the code BROTHER. That's five dollars off your first order

777
00:33:38,800 --> 00:33:41,200
and zero delivery fees for a month when you download the DoorDash app

778
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:42,720
in the App Store and enter code BROTHER.

779
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:47,840
Don't forget, that's code BROTHER for five dollars off your first order with DoorDash.

780
00:33:48,560 --> 00:33:50,000
Hey Justin, can I ask you a question?

781
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:51,440
I'd love that, Trev.

782
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:54,800
In your life, what would you say is the thing you're most proud of?

783
00:33:54,800 --> 00:34:01,440
Probably that at least half of my children seem to be decent human beings.

784
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:06,800
Okay, for me, it's a website I made using Squarespace called buttercupisaveverygoodgirl.com.

785
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:08,800
That's a website I made.

786
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:10,400
There's just a lot of pictures of my dog.

787
00:34:10,400 --> 00:34:14,080
There's even like a flash game on there about how great my dog Buttercup is.

788
00:34:14,080 --> 00:34:16,080
And I was able to do that through Squarespace.

789
00:34:16,080 --> 00:34:20,080
And that's way better than any kind of kid or, I don't know,

790
00:34:20,080 --> 00:34:22,160
joy you get from family or anything like that.

791
00:34:22,160 --> 00:34:27,040
Because Squarespace can showcase your work, sell products and services of all kinds,

792
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:30,240
promote your physical or online business, and more.

793
00:34:30,240 --> 00:34:31,680
You shouldn't be saying stuff like this.

794
00:34:31,680 --> 00:34:32,640
This is fucked up.

795
00:34:33,200 --> 00:34:34,320
It says it right there, though.

796
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:35,520
I didn't write that in the copy.

797
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:38,640
Guys, listen, I want everybody at home to know that Squarespace didn't write that.

798
00:34:38,640 --> 00:34:41,520
Travis is being pretty fucked up right now if you ask me.

799
00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:43,600
It says it right here in my copy.

800
00:34:43,600 --> 00:34:44,880
Do you not see it?

801
00:34:44,880 --> 00:34:49,920
Okay, I'm just saying I got a Squarespace website about how much I love my incredible son.

802
00:34:49,920 --> 00:34:54,640
And I know Justin has one also for my incredible son because he's really very powerful.

803
00:34:55,840 --> 00:34:58,320
Yeah, it's griffinsincredible son.com.

804
00:34:58,320 --> 00:34:58,560
Yeah.

805
00:34:58,560 --> 00:34:59,680
Fuck.

806
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:03,200
Yeah, Justin, you gotta stop wishing that shit into existence.

807
00:35:04,640 --> 00:35:09,520
I have to get it before the show goes out or I just won't do it.

808
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:13,760
And they also have analytics that help you grow in real time,

809
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:18,320
free and secure hosting, and nothing to patch or upgrade ever.

810
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:22,800
And it comes with a full gallery of pictures of Griffin's powerful son.

811
00:35:23,360 --> 00:35:24,560
He's mighty, guys.

812
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:28,880
He's so fucking strong and he scares me with how powerful his muscles are.

813
00:35:29,600 --> 00:35:32,080
And no matter what your website is for,

814
00:35:32,080 --> 00:35:35,280
if you include one picture of Griffin's powerful son,

815
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:38,240
your website traffic will increase exponentially.

816
00:35:38,240 --> 00:35:41,360
Just be careful because I did play catch with him and he broke my collarbone.

817
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:47,280
So go to squarespace.com slash my brother for a free trial.

821
00:35:57,440 --> 00:36:00,320
Hey, I'm Janet Farney, host of the JV Club Podcast.

822
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:03,040
Ah, high school.

823
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:06,480
Was it a time of adventure, romance, and discovery?

824
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:09,840
Class of 95, we did it!

825
00:36:09,840 --> 00:36:14,800
Or a time of angst, disappointment, and confusion?

826
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:17,840
We're all tied together by four years of trauma at this place,

827
00:36:17,840 --> 00:36:19,600
but enjoy adulthood, I guess.

828
00:36:19,600 --> 00:36:23,200
The truth is, it was both.

829
00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:26,880
So join me on the JV Club Podcast,

830
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:30,240
where I invite some great friends like Kristen Bell, Angela Kinsey,

831
00:36:30,240 --> 00:36:33,040
Oscar Nunez, Neil Patrick Harris, and Keegan-Michael Key

832
00:36:33,040 --> 00:36:36,640
to talk about high school, the good, the bad, and everything in between.

833
00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:39,680
My teenage mood swings are getting harder to manage!

834
00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:42,000
The JV Club. Find it on Maximum Fun.

835
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:44,640
Uh, I gotta have a Yahoo or-

836
00:36:44,640 --> 00:36:45,120
Ba ba ba ba ba ba.

837
00:36:45,120 --> 00:36:46,800
Yeah, that was the other option.

838
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:49,520
Da da da ba ba ba bum.

839
00:36:49,520 --> 00:36:54,400
Can't make this theme song long enough to cover my hover purchase.

840
00:36:57,440 --> 00:36:59,120
Typing in my personal information.

841
00:37:00,160 --> 00:37:03,120
God, I can't take the risk that somebody else will get it.

842
00:37:03,120 --> 00:37:04,640
Now it's in my cart.

843
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:05,920
I want a munch!

844
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:07,120
Squad!

845
00:37:07,120 --> 00:37:10,240
While I type in my credit card info.

846
00:37:10,240 --> 00:37:11,360
I want a munch!

847
00:37:11,360 --> 00:37:12,240
Squad!

848
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:14,320
Good news, it's saved in there.

849
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:18,160
I'm just clicking submit.

850
00:37:18,160 --> 00:37:19,040
Welcome to Munch Squad.

851
00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:21,120
It's a podcast within a podcast.

852
00:37:21,120 --> 00:37:26,160
And now we are headed into Munch Squad flashback, as I call it,

853
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:28,800
which is a podcast within a podcast,

854
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:36,080
within a podcast where we talk about the oldest and greatest in brand eating.

855
00:37:36,080 --> 00:37:39,600
I am so excited.

856
00:37:39,600 --> 00:37:40,080
Oh boy.

857
00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:43,440
I'm really excited about this one.

858
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:48,720
I have a huge debt to Kyle for sharing this with me

859
00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:54,000
because it is, God, what a treat.

860
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,640
So the year, I want to take you back a little bit.

861
00:37:56,640 --> 00:38:00,720
The year is 2008.

862
00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:01,360
Okay.

863
00:38:01,360 --> 00:38:05,600
And it's the dog days of summer, August 26th.

864
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:13,120
But as the temperature is rising, so is the tide of rock and roll,

865
00:38:13,120 --> 00:38:17,040
which is experiencing a rebirth at Denny's.

866
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:24,320
Denny's pairs with rockers for new menu.

867
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:28,880
Denny's is rolling out a new all night rockstar menu.

868
00:38:29,520 --> 00:38:33,440
Top musicians such as, we're going to cover that in a moment,

869
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:38,560
join Denny's to create the new Denny's rockstar menu presented by Dr. Pepper.

870
00:38:38,560 --> 00:38:43,440
Quote, we teamed up with popular bands in an out of the box way

871
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:49,760
to develop a menu by rockstars for our rockstar guests, says Mark Schmel,

872
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:52,560
chief marketing and innovation officer for Denny's.

873
00:38:52,560 --> 00:38:55,280
Music and late night are part of the Denny's DNA.

874
00:38:55,840 --> 00:38:58,960
Denny's has been a late night destination for musicians, fans,

875
00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:01,040
crews and crowds for over 50 years.

876
00:39:01,040 --> 00:39:05,840
So it is natural for us to have them create the meal they would most like to eat.

877
00:39:06,560 --> 00:39:08,160
Is that true?

878
00:39:08,160 --> 00:39:12,880
The late night diner asked four of bands, that's what it said,

879
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:14,240
to cook up something special.

880
00:39:14,240 --> 00:39:15,040
Wait, really?

881
00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:16,240
It says four of bands.

882
00:39:17,360 --> 00:39:18,640
This is my favorite tarot card.

883
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:23,840
To cook up something special for Denny's 10 p.m. to 5 a.m. menu.

884
00:39:24,560 --> 00:39:29,600
The bands, along with Denny's culinary innovation chef, Andrew Dismore,

885
00:39:29,600 --> 00:39:32,560
what a thrill this afternoon must have been for Andrew,

886
00:39:32,560 --> 00:39:36,560
invented dishes that are ideal for late night dining with friends and groups.

887
00:39:36,560 --> 00:39:42,240
The new menu items created by rockstars include taking back bacon burger fries

888
00:39:42,240 --> 00:39:44,880
created by New York based band Taking Back Sunday.

889
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:48,560
It combines two of the artist's favorite foods,

890
00:39:48,560 --> 00:39:50,960
bacon cheeseburger and loaded cheese fries.

891
00:39:53,840 --> 00:39:59,360
The Plain White Shake by Chicago band The Plain White Teas.

892
00:39:59,360 --> 00:40:02,720
Blends whole milk, vanilla ice cream, you know, shake shit.

893
00:40:02,720 --> 00:40:08,080
Heart on a Plate by California rockers Eagles of Death Metal starts with

894
00:40:08,080 --> 00:40:10,400
heart-shaped pancakes topped with raspberry sauce,

895
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:15,200
heart fudge, strawberries, white chocolate chips and whipped cream.

896
00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:19,120
The heart-themed entree, a tribute to their soon-to-be-released album,

897
00:40:19,120 --> 00:40:22,160
Heart On, good for you Eagles of Death Metal,

898
00:40:22,160 --> 00:40:25,120
is served with crispy bacon and eggs in any style.

899
00:40:26,480 --> 00:40:31,680
The All-American SOS brings the timeless classic and hometown favorite dish

900
00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:35,200
of Stillwater, Oklahoma, band The All-American Rejects to life

901
00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:38,240
with hamburger, cheese, grilled onions and gravy

902
00:40:38,240 --> 00:40:40,560
on top of Texas toast and hash browns.

903
00:40:42,560 --> 00:40:45,200
Denny's is striving to appeal to the late night crowd

904
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:48,160
with a whole new vibe from 10 p.m. to 5 a.m.

905
00:40:48,160 --> 00:40:51,680
And this is pretty, like, you want to be careful if you're going with kids

906
00:40:52,240 --> 00:40:56,080
during this time frame, because in 2008, because it was pretty fucking nasty.

907
00:40:56,080 --> 00:41:00,320
They featured alternative music, alternative rock music,

908
00:41:00,320 --> 00:41:02,880
alternative rock music playing through the restaurant

909
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:07,280
and servers sporting t-shirts and jeans instead of the usual uniforms.

910
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:08,960
What? No, no, no, no, no, no.

911
00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:09,600
Whoa.

912
00:41:09,600 --> 00:41:12,560
Do the t-shirts at least say Denny's on them?

913
00:41:12,560 --> 00:41:13,920
So I do know I'm still in a Denny's.

914
00:41:15,040 --> 00:41:17,120
There's no way of knowing without a time machine.

915
00:41:17,120 --> 00:41:22,640
In keeping with this rock and roll history, Denny's is also lending a helping hand

916
00:41:22,640 --> 00:41:26,720
to emerging bands through the Adopt a Band program.

917
00:41:26,720 --> 00:41:27,360
Oh, boy.

918
00:41:27,360 --> 00:41:30,480
Bands can enter to become a Denny's Adopted Band.

919
00:41:31,360 --> 00:41:37,440
So I this site, which is Denny'sAllNighter.com, no longer functions.

920
00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:43,120
But I did dip into the archive to just go ahead and see some of the bands

921
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:49,600
like Cash Cash, William Control, The Sleeping, Bring Me the Horizon,

922
00:41:49,600 --> 00:41:52,560
Tickle Me Pink, You, Me and Everyone We Know

923
00:41:53,840 --> 00:41:57,040
were just some of the Denny's sponsor bands.

924
00:41:57,040 --> 00:42:03,840
And this website is a blog of these small bands eating at Denny's all around the nation.

925
00:42:03,840 --> 00:42:06,240
And they would have like a fan meetup.

926
00:42:06,240 --> 00:42:11,040
After a show, they just go to the local Denny's and have an after party.

927
00:42:11,040 --> 00:42:18,800
And there's pictures documenting people eating at Denny's with their fans.

928
00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:20,800
Damn, it's like I can taste the Warped Tour.

929
00:42:21,440 --> 00:42:21,840
I know.

930
00:42:23,120 --> 00:42:24,560
I have great news for you.

931
00:42:24,560 --> 00:42:31,040
Okay, this promotion was so successful that they went ahead and just did another round

932
00:42:32,720 --> 00:42:34,160
of of people.

933
00:42:34,160 --> 00:42:38,080
They did a whole other round to add to the Rockstar menu.

934
00:42:39,520 --> 00:42:44,000
Some 41 made an unnamed French toast sandwich.

935
00:42:44,640 --> 00:42:48,720
They didn't go with Yum Yum 41 Yum 41.

936
00:42:48,720 --> 00:42:49,840
It's right there.

937
00:42:51,520 --> 00:42:53,280
Yum 41.

938
00:42:53,280 --> 00:42:59,200
Some 41 stopped by to make a French toast sandwich at the lab, the food lab.

939
00:43:00,080 --> 00:43:04,720
And miraculously, and I am so thankful to internet for this.

940
00:43:04,720 --> 00:43:06,880
It did so many things wrong.

941
00:43:06,880 --> 00:43:12,480
But somehow the comments from this February 24th, 2009 story aren't still alive.

942
00:43:13,120 --> 00:43:15,040
Rock and roll breakfast smile.

943
00:43:15,920 --> 00:43:18,560
OMG, that actually looks not bad.

944
00:43:19,120 --> 00:43:22,080
I will have to try and make something like that sometime tomorrow

945
00:43:22,080 --> 00:43:24,880
if I get around to it or remember it for that matter.

946
00:43:24,880 --> 00:43:26,320
Just go to Denny's.

947
00:43:26,320 --> 00:43:27,440
Just go to Denny's.

948
00:43:27,440 --> 00:43:28,960
They make it for you at Denny's.

949
00:43:29,920 --> 00:43:31,280
Dang, they're creative.

950
00:43:31,280 --> 00:43:32,560
That looks superbly good.

951
00:43:33,600 --> 00:43:37,840
Cooking, even cooking looks fun when some 41 is doing it.

952
00:43:37,840 --> 00:43:38,640
Oh my God.

953
00:43:40,400 --> 00:43:44,000
Justin, are you going to go over the other menu items?

954
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:44,880
Well, let's see.

955
00:43:44,880 --> 00:43:48,480
Here's the first thing I want to say is that Taking Back Sunday made another one.

956
00:43:48,480 --> 00:43:49,040
Yeah.

957
00:43:49,040 --> 00:43:52,560
Like apparently Taking Back Sunday was so deeply into this

958
00:43:52,560 --> 00:43:55,120
that they just like did another one.

959
00:43:55,120 --> 00:43:58,880
And it's called the melty grilled chicken and sausage quesadilla.

960
00:43:59,600 --> 00:44:04,320
They've just kind of given up the conceit of making it be a part of their name also.

961
00:44:05,200 --> 00:44:09,040
At that point, Taking Back Sunday had just bought a couple Denny's franchises

962
00:44:09,040 --> 00:44:10,880
and they were just looking to be successful.

963
00:44:10,880 --> 00:44:13,200
They weren't really worried about the tie-in so much as they're like,

964
00:44:13,200 --> 00:44:16,720
I think this will be a good meal at a fair price that people will enjoy.

965
00:44:16,720 --> 00:44:22,400
Boys like girls introduced a hot prime rib sandwich called the Great Egg Steak.

966
00:44:22,400 --> 00:44:22,900
Huh.

967
00:44:23,920 --> 00:44:29,120
And I do, let me just check and see if, yes.

968
00:44:29,600 --> 00:44:34,480
Hoobastank serves up a burrito with crispy chicken strips,

969
00:44:34,480 --> 00:44:37,760
pepper jack cheese, cheese sauce, fried onion, crispers,

970
00:44:37,760 --> 00:44:40,080
and a hint of barbecue sauce.

971
00:44:40,080 --> 00:44:43,280
Serve with tortillas and a side of cheese sauce and ranch dressing.

972
00:44:43,280 --> 00:44:47,040
And yes, it is called the Hoobarito.

973
00:44:47,040 --> 00:44:49,680
I, can I, can I say something?

974
00:44:49,680 --> 00:44:52,560
Hey, hey guys, maybe unpopular opinion.

975
00:44:53,600 --> 00:44:55,280
I'd fuck that clean up.

976
00:44:55,760 --> 00:44:56,260
Yeah.

977
00:44:56,720 --> 00:45:02,000
Hey Hoobastank, you've devised a very clever burrito there.

978
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:06,640
Yeah, who knew instead of polluting the airwaves throughout the 2000s,

979
00:45:06,640 --> 00:45:11,520
they should have been just making like drunk food apparently.

980
00:45:11,520 --> 00:45:14,480
I would drink this one dead sober.

981
00:45:14,480 --> 00:45:15,600
I mean, eat it.

982
00:45:15,600 --> 00:45:19,840
I would drink it too, hard pressed, if that's the only option available to me.

983
00:45:19,840 --> 00:45:24,400
Katy Perry also made a hot and cold cherry chocolate cappuccino.

984
00:45:24,400 --> 00:45:28,320
But how can it be hot and cold?

985
00:45:28,320 --> 00:45:28,640
Because-

986
00:45:28,640 --> 00:45:33,520
Let's check with Katy who said, quote, it's hot, it's cold,

987
00:45:33,520 --> 00:45:35,920
it's a love affair for your taste buds.

988
00:45:35,920 --> 00:45:39,760
Yes, but I'm no scientist, but it says here that-

989
00:45:39,760 --> 00:45:42,560
Then maybe you should shut your mouth because Ms. Perry is-

990
00:45:42,560 --> 00:45:45,840
But it's the concoction includes, I'm sorry Griffin,

991
00:45:45,840 --> 00:45:49,440
but the concoction includes vanilla ice cream, hot fudge.

992
00:45:49,440 --> 00:45:49,940
Hot.

993
00:45:50,480 --> 00:45:54,320
And it's right, like I've literally just shot your whole shit down right there,

994
00:45:54,320 --> 00:45:55,520
Dr. Scientist Travis.

995
00:45:55,520 --> 00:45:57,760
But, and French and vanilla cappuccino.

996
00:45:57,760 --> 00:46:02,800
Seems to me, like if you pour hot fudge and French vanilla cappuccino over ice cream,

997
00:46:02,800 --> 00:46:06,320
what you end up with is a pretty room temperature drink.

998
00:46:06,320 --> 00:46:12,240
I will also say that it would be wild to drink coffee and then encounter cherry.

999
00:46:12,960 --> 00:46:15,760
There's a cherry in my coffee, that's very strange.

1000
00:46:16,720 --> 00:46:20,720
But I guess Katy made that herself, so I'm not gonna get all up on her rant about it.

1001
00:46:21,760 --> 00:46:25,680
This website, there's not like a linear into it.

1002
00:46:25,680 --> 00:46:29,600
Maybe if anybody else wants to dig in there to the Denny's All Nighter archive,

1003
00:46:30,640 --> 00:46:32,720
some of our beloved listeners want to do that,

1004
00:46:32,720 --> 00:46:35,600
let us know if you find anything else good and we'll be sure to pass that along.

1005
00:46:35,600 --> 00:46:36,880
But that is our Munch Squad.

1006
00:46:36,880 --> 00:46:42,720
I can't, like, everybody's hurting economically, for sure.

1007
00:46:43,280 --> 00:46:47,680
But it is a good way to remember that there was one point when people had,

1008
00:46:47,680 --> 00:46:49,840
I think we'll all agree, too much money.

1009
00:46:49,840 --> 00:46:50,320
Yeah.

1010
00:46:50,320 --> 00:46:51,120
You know what I mean?

1011
00:46:51,120 --> 00:46:55,600
Like, they just had too much money, so this kind of fixed that a little bit.

1012
00:46:56,320 --> 00:46:58,080
Made them have less, you know what I mean?

1013
00:46:58,080 --> 00:46:58,400
Yeah.

1014
00:46:58,400 --> 00:46:59,920
Because we did have too much.

1015
00:46:59,920 --> 00:47:00,240
I think-

1016
00:47:00,240 --> 00:47:02,320
So less money in this sense is okay.

1017
00:47:02,320 --> 00:47:04,080
I do think this is what inflation is.

1018
00:47:04,080 --> 00:47:06,400
Okay, okay.

1019
00:47:07,120 --> 00:47:10,560
Here's just a quick Yahoo that several people sent in by One Punch Man.

1020
00:47:10,560 --> 00:47:11,360
Thank you.

1021
00:47:11,360 --> 00:47:12,720
Or wait, that's who asked it.

1022
00:47:12,720 --> 00:47:17,520
I don't want to thank them because they do ask, are hippos stab proof?

1023
00:47:19,120 --> 00:47:20,880
I heard the hippos are close to bulletproof,

1024
00:47:20,880 --> 00:47:24,320
so they could certainly shrug off a sword attack by a human, right?

1025
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:28,800
Now, there's a lot posited there.

1026
00:47:29,360 --> 00:47:29,840
Yeah.

1027
00:47:29,840 --> 00:47:30,080
Yeah.

1028
00:47:30,080 --> 00:47:34,000
Yeah, how could something be almost bulletproof?

1029
00:47:34,560 --> 00:47:38,240
I don't want to celebrate the idea of hurting a beautiful hippopotamus,

1030
00:47:39,440 --> 00:47:42,640
but I do enjoy the fact that they are apparently,

1031
00:47:42,640 --> 00:47:46,400
they can't be killed with bullets.

1032
00:47:47,200 --> 00:47:48,640
There's almost like a-

1033
00:47:48,640 --> 00:47:49,280
Almost.

1034
00:47:49,280 --> 00:47:49,760
Almost.

1035
00:47:50,880 --> 00:47:52,880
How have we measured that, I wonder?

1036
00:47:52,880 --> 00:47:53,760
That's what I'm saying.

1037
00:47:53,760 --> 00:47:58,640
How do you quantify, is it like some bullets will hurt it and some won't,

1038
00:47:58,640 --> 00:48:00,240
or it only hurts it a little bit?

1039
00:48:00,240 --> 00:48:03,120
I feel like it gets shot a bunch and then the doctor comes out and it's like,

1040
00:48:03,120 --> 00:48:05,680
well, it was touch and go there for a while.

1041
00:48:05,680 --> 00:48:08,960
I did think that it would survive, and then as it turns out, it did not.

1042
00:48:10,240 --> 00:48:11,840
It was very close, though.

1043
00:48:11,840 --> 00:48:12,640
It was very close.

1044
00:48:12,640 --> 00:48:17,520
Or just a very unethical scientist lined up five hippos, shot five of them, and two died.

1045
00:48:17,520 --> 00:48:21,280
And they're like, well, damn, that's, I'm gonna call it,

1046
00:48:21,280 --> 00:48:24,800
that's pretty, that's more bulletproof than us humans are.

1047
00:48:26,640 --> 00:48:27,840
So a sword attack.

1048
00:48:27,840 --> 00:48:29,120
Hippos are dangerous, right?

1049
00:48:29,120 --> 00:48:30,880
Like hippo, and I don't-

1050
00:48:30,880 --> 00:48:32,400
Oh, hippos are monsters.

1051
00:48:32,400 --> 00:48:33,040
Yeah, I don't wanna stand with that.

1052
00:48:33,040 --> 00:48:35,360
That's why they have them on the Disney Jungle Cruise.

1053
00:48:36,880 --> 00:48:38,000
Yeah, they, yeah.

1054
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:47,200
And so I would argue you're not gonna be able to get in there.

1055
00:48:47,200 --> 00:48:52,240
Like you could have a lot of like incredible sword technique.

1056
00:48:52,240 --> 00:48:56,880
You've been studying the blade and the blockchain while the rest of us were partying.

1057
00:48:56,880 --> 00:49:02,160
But I do think you get within a certain distance of one of these big, powerful beasts.

1058
00:49:02,160 --> 00:49:05,680
And like, you're just gonna, that part of your brain,

1059
00:49:05,680 --> 00:49:09,040
the sword fighting part of your brain is just gonna like be completely overwhelmed

1060
00:49:09,040 --> 00:49:11,520
by the part that makes you shit your pants and fall down.

1061
00:49:12,160 --> 00:49:17,760
And I would say the exact opposite would be true for the hippopotamus.

1062
00:49:17,760 --> 00:49:22,400
Because I don't believe that the hippopotamus would see you wielding a sword and think, oh no.

1063
00:49:22,400 --> 00:49:23,840
Oh no, I should stay away.

1064
00:49:24,640 --> 00:49:26,640
They would, I think in most situations,

1065
00:49:26,640 --> 00:49:28,240
and maybe this is why hippos are so dangerous,

1066
00:49:28,240 --> 00:49:31,760
is that they just always have the thought in their mind of like, I got this.

1067
00:49:31,760 --> 00:49:32,880
I'm so big.

1068
00:49:32,880 --> 00:49:34,240
I'm a hungry, hungry guy.

1069
00:49:35,440 --> 00:49:36,720
I'm gonna munch that dude.

1070
00:49:38,560 --> 00:49:42,560
Apparently hipposkin is very thick and quote resistant to puncture.

1071
00:49:42,560 --> 00:49:47,040
So I guess it does come down to the sort of like sharpness.

1072
00:49:48,400 --> 00:49:49,440
How about, let's see.

1073
00:49:49,440 --> 00:49:51,200
No, we're gonna keep talking about this.

1074
00:49:52,080 --> 00:49:52,320
Okay.

1075
00:49:52,320 --> 00:49:55,600
Okay.

1076
00:49:55,600 --> 00:49:59,920
I think we can all agree that the only way to stab a hippo is from the inside out.

1077
00:50:00,720 --> 00:50:02,960
Oh, like Ace Ventura.

1078
00:50:02,960 --> 00:50:06,800
Fuck, I still bust the fuck up whenever I think about that scene.

1079
00:50:07,360 --> 00:50:08,960
Oh, it's a rhinoceros, isn't it?

1080
00:50:09,760 --> 00:50:11,760
Remember he climbs out the rhino's butthole?

1081
00:50:11,760 --> 00:50:14,000
Justin, you've never seen any movie with Jim Carrey in it.

1082
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:17,600
No, he climbs out the rhino's butthole into a hippopotamus butthole.

1083
00:50:17,600 --> 00:50:18,160
Right.

1084
00:50:18,160 --> 00:50:19,680
Forever, back and forth.

1085
00:50:19,680 --> 00:50:22,480
Justin, I do want you to do this third question before we go,

1086
00:50:22,480 --> 00:50:23,520
because I love it a lot.

1087
00:50:25,920 --> 00:50:27,360
We're already running long, aren't you?

1088
00:50:27,360 --> 00:50:28,800
Oh, they're worth it, Juice.

1089
00:50:28,800 --> 00:50:29,520
They're worth it.

1090
00:50:29,520 --> 00:50:31,360
All right, all right, all right.

1091
00:50:31,360 --> 00:50:34,240
Just for you guys, just for our beloved fans.

1092
00:50:34,960 --> 00:50:36,560
This one's for you, the fans.

1093
00:50:37,120 --> 00:50:40,320
When I was in third grade, my school held a writing competition.

1094
00:50:40,320 --> 00:50:42,800
I submitted a story and it was one of the winners.

1095
00:50:42,800 --> 00:50:46,640
I got a $5 McDonald's gift card and that was the last I thought of it.

1096
00:50:46,640 --> 00:50:49,040
Until recently, when my old elementary school announced that

1097
00:50:49,040 --> 00:50:52,240
they'd be releasing a book of all the stories that had won the competition

1098
00:50:52,240 --> 00:50:55,280
as a way to look fondly on pre-quarantine times.

1099
00:50:55,280 --> 00:50:59,680
The problem is, I plagiarized my story from an encyclopedia brown book.

1100
00:51:00,560 --> 00:51:04,560
I changed the names of the characters, but it was still otherwise exactly the same.

1101
00:51:05,200 --> 00:51:07,200
Thesaurus Green!

1102
00:51:07,200 --> 00:51:10,160
Was reckless and thought of nothing of the consequences,

1103
00:51:10,160 --> 00:51:13,440
but now I'm afraid the story will be released and everybody will see what a fraud I am.

1104
00:51:13,440 --> 00:51:16,320
How do I stop my story from being released without raising suspicion?

1105
00:51:16,320 --> 00:51:18,320
That's from Playdress in Pennsylvania.

1106
00:51:18,320 --> 00:51:19,680
Holy shit.

1107
00:51:20,400 --> 00:51:22,480
I'm gonna see if Donald J. Sobel's still alive.

1108
00:51:23,440 --> 00:51:27,280
If he's been dead for seven years, technically, I think you can't plagiarize him anymore.

1109
00:51:27,840 --> 00:51:30,080
Pretty sure that's how copyright law works.

1110
00:51:30,080 --> 00:51:33,520
Ah, but you're not thinking about the expiration of the crime, Griffin.

1111
00:51:33,520 --> 00:51:36,160
Hey, great news, Donald J. Sobel is dead.

1112
00:51:36,160 --> 00:51:37,920
No, wait, eight years ago.

1113
00:51:37,920 --> 00:51:39,920
So it's, okay, that's fine.

1114
00:51:39,920 --> 00:51:40,640
So that's fine.

1115
00:51:40,640 --> 00:51:41,600
Legally, you're in the clear.

1116
00:51:41,600 --> 00:51:43,200
Let's talk about ethics and morals.

1117
00:51:44,240 --> 00:51:47,680
Yeah, I think that is actually not great news that Donald J. Sobel.

1118
00:51:47,680 --> 00:51:48,800
No, it's not dead.

1119
00:51:48,800 --> 00:51:50,000
I'm sorry I phrased it the way.

1120
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:52,000
I don't want people to take that out of context.

1121
00:51:53,440 --> 00:51:56,080
Listen, you're about to have a great shame brought upon your house.

1122
00:51:56,080 --> 00:51:59,760
And I don't know what else to say.

1123
00:51:59,760 --> 00:52:01,360
There's no way to get around that.

1124
00:52:01,360 --> 00:52:05,680
You can't go to the school and hack into the transcript.

1125
00:52:07,040 --> 00:52:08,160
That ship has sailed.

1126
00:52:08,160 --> 00:52:12,640
You fucked up so bad so long ago, and there's no way to put more English on the ball.

1127
00:52:12,640 --> 00:52:21,040
Could you blame it on Donald J. Sobel and say that he must have gotten a hold of your rough draft

1128
00:52:21,040 --> 00:52:24,160
and published it, stealing your story?

1129
00:52:25,200 --> 00:52:25,600
Yeah, you're gonna have to-

1130
00:52:25,600 --> 00:52:26,320
This isn't great.

1131
00:52:26,320 --> 00:52:27,840
Listen, I love Encyclopedia Brown.

1132
00:52:27,840 --> 00:52:29,280
I love Donald J. Sobel.

1133
00:52:29,280 --> 00:52:33,760
I hate to, but I'm saying you could pin it on him.

1134
00:52:33,760 --> 00:52:34,400
Yeah.

1135
00:52:34,400 --> 00:52:36,880
That would be a real bugziney thing to do, though.

1136
00:52:36,880 --> 00:52:46,080
I think that if you do plant, and God, I really don't want to besmirch this dude's name,

1137
00:52:46,720 --> 00:52:52,320
but if you do plant the $5 McDonald's gift card in his desk, it's gonna be a confusing clue.

1138
00:52:52,960 --> 00:52:58,320
But the police, I think any detective worth their salt is gonna find that and,

1139
00:52:58,880 --> 00:53:03,040
you know, figure out the frame that you're putting together here.

1140
00:53:03,040 --> 00:53:04,720
You're probably gonna have to fake your own death.

1141
00:53:04,720 --> 00:53:09,680
Yeah, it's overfreak- Yeah, that's a good note, Trev.

1142
00:53:10,960 --> 00:53:15,920
It's probably time, no matter what you do, to start taking stock of your life as it is now

1143
00:53:15,920 --> 00:53:18,560
and start sort of wrapping up some of your affairs,

1144
00:53:19,840 --> 00:53:26,160
because your life won't really resemble what you know right now, you know what I mean?

1145
00:53:26,160 --> 00:53:28,240
It'll be a very different life that you'll be leading,

1146
00:53:29,440 --> 00:53:31,440
and I think that it's good to be prepared for that.

1147
00:53:31,440 --> 00:53:35,360
Like, a good idea that excites me on a very personal level.

1148
00:53:36,160 --> 00:53:38,320
You should email your teacher and be like,

1149
00:53:38,320 --> 00:53:44,880
oh, that's great, I've actually done a few edits to that draft, and I think honestly-

1150
00:53:44,880 --> 00:53:47,520
I've been working on it for the last 20 years!

1151
00:53:47,520 --> 00:53:50,320
Yeah, and I think it'd be honestly pretty fucked up for you to put out

1152
00:53:50,320 --> 00:53:53,040
my first draft of it, and here's a new version of it.

1153
00:53:53,040 --> 00:53:55,360
And your new version of it could be a completely different thing.

1154
00:53:55,360 --> 00:54:00,160
Now, what excites me is I would love to take another pass at Grand Andrews Kid Cop.

1155
00:54:00,160 --> 00:54:03,280
I've had some ideas about Grand Andrews Kid Cop

1156
00:54:03,280 --> 00:54:05,600
that I think could really flesh out the lore.

1157
00:54:05,600 --> 00:54:09,520
I would probably remove all of the references to Jet Moto,

1158
00:54:09,520 --> 00:54:13,600
a very unsuccessful PlayStation 1 era racing game.

1159
00:54:13,600 --> 00:54:16,000
That one can probably hit the bricks.

1160
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:17,680
This is going to get you out of the scrape,

1161
00:54:17,680 --> 00:54:21,520
but it's also going to allow you to punch up your work.

1162
00:54:21,520 --> 00:54:25,360
Although actually, your work was stolen, so you will maybe make it worse.

1163
00:54:25,360 --> 00:54:27,920
Definitely make it worse. There's no question about that.

1164
00:54:27,920 --> 00:54:30,240
Thank you so much for listening to our podcast.

1165
00:54:30,240 --> 00:54:31,520
We hope you've enjoyed yourself.

1166
00:54:32,320 --> 00:54:35,600
We are sure happy that you're with us.

1167
00:54:35,600 --> 00:54:40,160
We know that podcast listening time is a bit cattywumpus right now,

1168
00:54:40,160 --> 00:54:43,600
so we very much appreciate that you've carved out the time

1169
00:54:43,600 --> 00:54:46,240
to experience our program.

1170
00:54:46,800 --> 00:54:50,320
We wrote a book with our dad. It's called The Adventure Zone.

1171
00:54:50,320 --> 00:54:51,920
It pales to the metal. It comes out in July.

1172
00:54:51,920 --> 00:54:54,240
You can pre-order it now at TheAdventureZoneComic.com.

1173
00:54:54,240 --> 00:54:57,360
We have merchandise. We have our summer stickers.

1174
00:54:57,360 --> 00:55:00,720
If you want to buy some of those, McElroyMerch.com.

1175
00:55:00,720 --> 00:55:04,000
We got some fun stuff there, if you want that.

1176
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:06,640
I want to thank John Roderick in the long winters

1177
00:55:06,640 --> 00:55:07,760
for the use of our theme song

1178
00:55:07,760 --> 00:55:09,920
and to departure off the album, Putting the Days to Bed,

1179
00:55:09,920 --> 00:55:12,800
which you can go listen to at any time and no one can stop you.

1180
00:55:12,800 --> 00:55:15,200
And also Max Pun Fun.

1181
00:55:15,200 --> 00:55:20,000
What? Max Pun Fun.

1182
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:24,400
What? Max Pun Fun.

1183
00:55:24,400 --> 00:55:26,080
Oh, you know what? I will plug something.

1184
00:55:26,080 --> 00:55:29,600
Griffin and I make a video series called Monster Factory.

1185
00:55:29,600 --> 00:55:31,520
If you've never watched it, it's on our YouTube channel.

1186
00:55:31,520 --> 00:55:32,640
Just search YouTube for it.

1187
00:55:33,680 --> 00:55:35,760
And I think our new one's really funny.

1188
00:55:35,760 --> 00:55:36,800
It just came out last week.

1189
00:55:36,800 --> 00:55:41,520
So if you want to watch it, it's based on Dark Souls 3.

1190
00:55:41,520 --> 00:55:44,000
It's an adaptation of Dark Souls 3.

1191
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:46,000
I enjoyed it. I watched it. I watch every—

1192
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:48,720
I also listen to Besties, the video game podcast

1193
00:55:48,720 --> 00:55:50,080
that Justin and Griffin do,

1194
00:55:50,080 --> 00:55:52,080
along with Russ Freshtick and Chris Plant,

1195
00:55:52,800 --> 00:55:55,120
which is a Spotify original that I enjoy very much.

1196
00:55:55,120 --> 00:55:57,440
I listen to it as soon as each episode comes out,

1197
00:55:57,440 --> 00:56:01,040
though I have many feelings on the Bioshock episode

1198
00:56:01,040 --> 00:56:03,040
that we will talk about off mic.

1199
00:56:03,040 --> 00:56:04,400
We'll unpack that later.

1200
00:56:05,200 --> 00:56:10,400
I also wanted to say, coming up on June 6th at 1pm Eastern time,

1201
00:56:10,960 --> 00:56:14,720
I am going to be doing a live stream Dungeons and Dragons session

1202
00:56:14,720 --> 00:56:20,480
along with Will Rowland, Alex Boniello, and Andrew Barth Feldman,

1203
00:56:20,480 --> 00:56:23,680
who you may recognize from Dear Evan Hansen on Broadway,

1204
00:56:23,680 --> 00:56:28,560
as well as Matthew Mercer, Erica Ishii, and Satine Phoenix,

1205
00:56:28,560 --> 00:56:32,560
who you might recognize from the World of Actual Play podcasts.

1206
00:56:32,560 --> 00:56:36,160
We're going to be playing D&D and raising money for the Actors Fund,

1207
00:56:36,160 --> 00:56:39,600
as well as Feeding America, and I'm going to be DMing.

1208
00:56:40,480 --> 00:56:43,200
You can watch that. It's going to be on a Twitch channel.

1209
00:56:43,200 --> 00:56:47,760
So the whole thing is called Supporting Roles, R-O-L-L-S,

1210
00:56:48,560 --> 00:56:51,360
and you're going to be able to watch it on our Twitch channel,

1211
00:56:51,920 --> 00:56:54,480
twitch.tv supporting roles,

1212
00:56:54,480 --> 00:57:01,680
and you can go donate now if you go to bit.ly supporting IGG,

1213
00:57:01,680 --> 00:57:04,480
all lowercase, and that's our IndieGoGo,

1214
00:57:04,480 --> 00:57:06,400
and there are some reward levels there.

1215
00:57:06,400 --> 00:57:10,160
You can name NPCs, you can name the tavern we meet at,

1216
00:57:10,160 --> 00:57:13,520
you can like spring surprise monsters on the players,

1217
00:57:13,520 --> 00:57:16,800
you can give them magical items, all kinds of stuff,

1218
00:57:16,800 --> 00:57:19,840
or you could just like donate if you wanted to.

1219
00:57:19,840 --> 00:57:21,440
So go check that out.

1220
00:57:21,440 --> 00:57:25,200
And that's going to once again be June 6th, 1 p.m. Eastern time.

1221
00:57:26,240 --> 00:57:26,740
Cool.

1222
00:57:27,360 --> 00:57:29,680
I would love to read a Final Yahoo,

1223
00:57:29,680 --> 00:57:36,400
but I have just actually found a link to a recipe

1224
00:57:36,400 --> 00:57:40,240
recreating the Denny's Hoot Burrito experience.

1225
00:57:42,640 --> 00:57:43,920
Can I just read that?

1226
00:57:43,920 --> 00:57:45,760
Like I could take a passage just reading that.

1227
00:57:45,760 --> 00:57:46,800
Go for it.

1228
00:57:46,800 --> 00:57:47,520
Yeah, sure, yeah.

1229
00:57:47,520 --> 00:57:49,280
So you're going to need a half cup of chicken breast,

1230
00:57:49,280 --> 00:57:50,720
and you're going to want that to be shredded up.

1231
00:57:51,840 --> 00:57:52,880
You're going to need some cheese.

1232
00:57:52,880 --> 00:57:54,640
It just says cheese sauce.

1233
00:57:54,640 --> 00:57:56,480
This doesn't seem like a very good recipe.

1234
00:57:56,480 --> 00:57:57,600
I'll get back to y'all.

1235
00:57:57,600 --> 00:57:59,760
We'll come up with our own Hoot Burrito recipe

1236
00:57:59,760 --> 00:58:00,640
and get back to y'all.

1237
00:58:01,280 --> 00:58:02,480
But here is another.

1238
00:58:02,480 --> 00:58:04,960
This one's a real Yahoo that was sent in by Paul.

1239
00:58:04,960 --> 00:58:05,920
Thanks, Paul.

1240
00:58:05,920 --> 00:58:08,640
It's from Yahoo Answers user Asep, who asks,

1241
00:58:10,080 --> 00:58:12,880
is it true that dogs lick us

1242
00:58:12,880 --> 00:58:15,760
because we have bones inside of us that they want to eat?

1243
00:58:18,720 --> 00:58:20,080
My name is Justin McElroy.

1244
00:58:20,080 --> 00:58:21,280
I'm Travis McElroy.

1245
00:58:21,280 --> 00:58:22,880

1246
00:58:22,880 --> 00:58:24,240
This has been my brother, my brother, me.

1247
00:58:24,240 --> 00:58:37,280
Kiss your dad, square on the lips.

Is machine gun a robot?

1259
00:59:15,120 --> 00:59:18,000
Should a grown adult tell his parents about his tattoos?

1260
