1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:30,800
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:43,920
It's a new craze, and good girls do you wanna just say, hey, I wanna, just say, hey, I wanna.

6
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:47,120
Hello everybody and welcome to my brother, my brother Amin, and Vice show for the modern era.

7
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:50,880
I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy. I'm your middle-est brother, Travis McElroy.

8
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:57,680
I'm that sweet baby brother, Griffin McElroy. And America's battling back for her birthday.

9
00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:03,520
And that's right, America's birthday is here, and America, we're coming back.

10
00:01:04,240 --> 00:01:08,640
But we're coming back because a lot of other people are soon to be dropping the ball right now,

11
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:12,320
and America's just gonna sneak in there and reclaim his glory by default.

12
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:16,160
I'm looking around at the world today, I'm seeing a lot of nations just kind of

13
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:18,960
screwing the pooch. But we're back.

14
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:23,360
Basically, America's like moving up the education standards list because

15
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:26,000
suddenly every other country forgot how to read.

16
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,840
Which is one way to do it. It's one way to climb that old ladder in it.

17
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:33,200
You don't have to be the fastest, you just have to run the longest.

18
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:33,520
Right.

19
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:41,040
For her birthday. So America's back, and I just couldn't be happier to be from this great thumb

20
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:44,800
on earth. It's a kind of thumb shape. You ever try to draw America?

21
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:46,000
Man, it's so hard.

22
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,520
Hard, it's really hard.

23
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:51,040
Let me ask you this, Justin. What did you get America for her birthday?

24
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:56,400
Uh, I got America was, um, Amazon Echoes.

25
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:56,720
Nice.

26
00:01:57,520 --> 00:01:58,000
Nice.

27
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,120
I got, um...

28
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:06,320
I put it in Kansas because I wanted it to be, like, sorta central.

29
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:11,520
In the middle of it, yeah. And that way everyone can use it. You just, hey everybody,

30
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:15,200
real quick, stop the podcast, stop whatever you're doing, just yell at Kansas real quick.

31
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:19,920
Just be like, how do you convert 90 degrees Fahrenheit to Celsius?

32
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:23,520
Or, play Dave Matthews Band! Do you hear me, Kansas?

33
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:32,400
I forgot it was America's birthday again, and so I just went into the sheets and I got,

34
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:36,640
like, a teddy bear, and there's a little compartment, and it's belly for jelly beans.

35
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:36,880
Nice.

36
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:37,600
So, I bet.

37
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:43,760
I got America a Million XL t-shirt that says,

38
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:47,600
I'm with Stupid, and then there's arrows pointing in all directions.

39
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:50,560
Oh, that's great. Sort of a global burn.

40
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:54,800
Yeah. You know, it's important when you get a present for someone that you don't get the

41
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:57,360
present you want. You get the present they want.

42
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:58,640
Too true, Travis, too true.

43
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:04,320
And I felt like I wouldn't wear that giant ass t-shirt, but maybe America would, you know?

44
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:06,960
Plus it was on sale.

45
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:09,760
You'd be crushed to death under the shirt, I think, Travis.

46
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:12,080
It's so large. It's got a thick weave.

47
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:16,400
A thick weave to cover this beautiful nation of ours. Which, let's be honest,

48
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:21,120
I don't want to be a prude, but this nation's been too nude, too furious, for too long.

49
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:22,080
Yeah.

50
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:24,320
It's got bumps and humps and lumps everywhere.

51
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:29,680
Here's a fun fact. Here's a quick fun fact. Since we're talking about America,

52
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:31,680
it's this beautiful lady's birthday.

53
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:38,640
The center of the U.S. is the actual, like, geographical center of it, right?

54
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:43,040
It's in this place called Lebanon, Kansas, or two miles northwest, I guess.

55
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:46,080
So this is not the incredible fact I wanted to tell you.

56
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:50,400
There's a very tiny chapel there. Like, really, really small.

57
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:53,280
Like, four pews. Small, right?

58
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:58,560
There's a chapel there, but there's a little note that's set on this page I'm reading about.

59
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:04,480
It says, the U.S. geographic center chapel was destroyed by a speeding vehicle

60
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:09,840
missing the turn at the T intersection at the end of K-191 Highway on June 1st, 2008.

61
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:11,600
It's since been replaced by a new chapel.

62
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:17,280
I want nothing more. I'll tell you what, America, when my birthday comes around,

63
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:20,320
I want to hear the story that leads to this.

64
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:23,920
Like, guys, guys, I'm blazed.

65
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:29,360
We're going to go drive through the center of America and just plow through that tiny church.

66
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:29,920
Yeah.

67
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:31,200
Come on, don't be an idiot.

68
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:34,640
Well, here's the thing. They didn't say who was driving that car.

69
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:37,360
The answer is Joe Biden. Let me walk it back for you.

70
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:46,160
Joseph Gordon Biden, the vice principal of America, he had this amazing idea.

71
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:47,440
And he called me up and he told me about it.

72
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:49,040
And let me relay the idea.

73
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:53,280
The plan, because now it's more of a plan because it's him taking action.

74
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:56,320
Step one, just get rid of that old chapel, he said.

75
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:58,080
We got to get rid of that old chapel.

76
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:00,400
He'd been listening to American Gods.

77
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:02,960
I'm going to drive my stang through it, he said.

78
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:04,720
And I was like, fuck, yeah, Joey.

79
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:07,280
And so he drove his stang right through it and destroyed it.

80
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:09,360
And then he called up Barack Obama.

81
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:10,720
I'm sorry, Barack Hussein Obama.

82
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:11,680
It's important a lot of people forget.

83
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:15,360
And said, here's my idea.

84
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:20,640
There's a new plot of real estate that just opened up centrally located, Barry.

85
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:26,240
And from this position, the new White House in the center of America,

86
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:28,560
you'll be able to get to wherever you need to go.

87
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:31,120
Like the easiest you could possibly do it.

88
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:34,800
Unless where you need to go is D.C.

89
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:37,360
At which point being in D.C. would probably have been easy.

90
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:38,480
It'd probably be a little bit better.

91
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:41,040
But D.C. is so far on the East Coast.

92
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:45,520
It's like if you need to get to like Montana, it's going to take forever.

93
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:52,720
So we're just not going to mention the fact that

94
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:56,400
Griffin called Joe Biden the vice principal of America, right?

95
00:05:58,240 --> 00:05:58,960
That's what he is.

96
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:02,400
Like you think about the typical sort of school structure, right?

97
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:05,040
The principal all about big picture ideas,

98
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:06,960
all about sort of like leading the school,

99
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:10,640
guiding them, giving them a hope, something to aspire to.

100
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:12,960
The vice principal, that's the ass kicker, isn't it?

101
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:14,160
That's the disciplinarian.

102
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:19,920
I was thinking that you either have your hard-nosed principal

103
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:23,440
that no one gets along with and you're kind of soft and friendly vice principal,

104
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:25,200
or you have like your bad-ass vice principal.

105
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:28,640
But the thing is, my question is this, Griffin.

106
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:33,360
Do you think that they discuss that like when a new vice principal gets hired

107
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:35,520
and the principal is like, listen, I'm the bad-ass.

108
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:36,560
No, no, no.

109
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:40,640
It was definitely like Barack Hussein Obama like walked into Joey's garage

110
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:42,560
and was like, listen, we need to figure this out.

111
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:46,640
And then like he wheeled himself out from underneath the stang that he was kitting up.

112
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:47,920
And he was like, I'll do it.

113
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:49,140
I'll do it.

114
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,720
You sound like Dominic Toretto there for a second.

115
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:54,800
Oh, he is basically, yeah.

116
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:59,760
Yeah, anyway, happy birthday, you big beautiful lady.

117
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:03,920
Did we release this on the 4th of July?

118
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:04,720
Probably not.

119
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:09,120
This one's probably going to go up on the 5th unless one of you boys wants to edit it.

120
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:10,560
No, not really.

121
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:12,480
You know what, guys?

122
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:17,280
We've been sort of slacking on questions per episode or QPE.

123
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:20,080
Well, we're like seven and a half minutes into this one already.

124
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:21,920
So I think this one's shaping up to be another-

125
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:23,280
It's better than Ray Donovan.

126
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:26,800
Ray Donovan, we were like 15 minutes in before we answered a question.

127
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:27,280
That's true.

128
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:29,680
But with that, I want to up our QPE this episode.

129
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:30,320
Let's get right into it.

130
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:32,240
One note about Ray Donovan, if I may.

131
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:33,600
Please stop.

132
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:35,840
Okay, you go ahead first.

133
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:36,960
And then I have a second note.

134
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:38,000
Maybe they're the same note.

135
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:38,880
Please go ahead, Griffin.

136
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:44,080
I was watching Unreal, terrific show on my Lifetime app,

137
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:47,120
which I'm probably not going to use for anything else.

138
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:48,560
Thank you, Lifetime.

139
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:51,840
And they apparently are sort of the same sort of family as Showtime.

140
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:54,320
So I did see a trailer for Ray Donovan.

141
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:57,600
And upon seeing it, I just kind of went, huh.

142
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:00,720
So that's what he is.

143
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:02,960
So that's the thing.

144
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:08,080
Very few toilets, much more punching celebrities and things.

145
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:09,440
So, wonderful.

146
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:11,920
We specifically asked on that episode,

147
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:15,360
please don't send us Ray Donovan related links and materials.

148
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:19,920
And do you know how many motherfucking Ray Donovan pictures

149
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:23,840
any time a Ray Donovan has hoved into everyone's field of vision,

150
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:25,680
they have submitted it to the Facebook group.

151
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:27,200
Please, no more.

152
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:28,960
I'm not going to approve your Ray Donovan.

153
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:29,840
And you know what?

154
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:31,680
Stop submitting the mac and cheese thing.

155
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:32,720
I did that last week.

156
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:33,760
Okay, now we're done.

157
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:36,000
Now, QPE up.

158
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,360
This is an advice show.

159
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:39,360
We turn your advice, Alchemy like it,

160
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:41,360
and questions Alchemy like into wisdom.

161
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:42,160
So here we go.

162
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:45,840
Hey brothers, my friend brought me a leg of lamb

163
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:49,440
she found in a supermarket dumpster as a house gift

164
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:51,120
when she came to stay for a couple of days.

165
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:54,000
She didn't mention it came from a dumpster

166
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:56,560
until I cooked it and served it.

167
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:57,280
Is this okay?

168
00:08:58,320 --> 00:08:59,440
Thanks, Joe.

169
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:02,400
All right, let's just keep that QPE up.

170
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:03,920
No, this is terrible, Joe.

171
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:05,440
Your friendship is dissolved.

172
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:06,560
I dissolve it.

173
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:08,000
This is legally binding.

174
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:08,800
It's over.

175
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:10,080
I want to address something here

176
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:12,960
because there is a movement in the world

177
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:16,720
where grocery stores and the sell by date and all that shit,

178
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:18,400
they get rid of perfectly good food.

179
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:19,920
And like, this is no joke

180
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:22,480
that there's a huge food waste in America.

181
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:29,680
That said, the issue here is that she did not fucking tell you.

182
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:32,240
She was like that woman who murders her husband

183
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:35,440
and then serves it to the detectives, you know?

184
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:37,520
That's what's going on here.

185
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:39,200
She knew she had committed a crime

186
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:41,920
and she waited till you consume the evidence to tell you.

187
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:43,040
Yeah, yes.

188
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:45,760
Yes, if she had mentioned it afterwards,

189
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:48,400
she knows she committed a crime.

190
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:51,040
The thing is, from my bigger hang up,

191
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:54,400
is a leg of lamb is not a thing I would eat out of a dumpster.

192
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:59,840
If somebody throws a carrot into a compost heap

193
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:02,400
and it's there for less than five minutes

194
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:04,080
and then somebody fishes it out of there,

195
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:05,600
gives it a good old scrub down

196
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:08,160
and then chops it up and makes like a little stew for me,

197
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:09,920
I ain't mad at you.

198
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:11,600
A leg of lamb is like,

199
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:19,280
there's so many ways that that protein could be compromised by the dumpster gas.

200
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:19,520
Yeah.

201
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:24,080
And also, if your friend wasn't up front with you,

202
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:27,040
you also can't trust your friend when asked the question,

203
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:30,000
how long was it in the dumpster before you got it?

204
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,520
Your friend is going to lie.

205
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:33,680
Yeah, don't get it mistaken.

206
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:38,240
You could no longer trust this friend for anything ever again.

207
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:41,600
Did you lock the apartment door before we left?

208
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:42,480
Oh yeah, totally.

209
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:43,840
Okay, so then you didn't.

210
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:46,800
Then you basically just confessed that you didn't do that.

211
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:49,120
Hey, you paid for this bag of Skittles we're both eating right now.

212
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:49,920
Oh yeah, for sure.

213
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:52,400
So you shoplifted it from Sheets.

214
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:52,720
Great.

215
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:53,760
Oh, wonderful.

216
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:54,880
No, but this is great, Griffin.

217
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:57,040
It's like, one of them always tells the truth,

218
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:58,320
one of them always tells the lie.

219
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:00,560
Now, if you look at your friend and you ask them a question,

220
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:03,840
they say you always know that the answer is the opposite of what they said.

221
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:07,520
Yeah, I don't want anybody to conscript me

222
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:12,000
into their efforts on anything via secret food.

223
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:15,360
You know what would make me mad?

224
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:19,680
If someone made a meal for me and I ate it and then they're like,

225
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:22,480
you would never guess this, but that was vegetarian.

226
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:26,240
And I'm sitting there with a full belly and then I'd be like,

227
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:28,320
okay, you would never guess this,

228
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:32,480
but now I have to go find some meat so I could have had dinner.

229
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:35,520
Oh, you're on that B-I-I-N-G-O plan,

230
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:37,680
that bingo plan from The Biggest Loser.

231
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:38,880
The boy on The Biggest Loser,

232
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:41,280
whose parents were trying to get him to drop a few LBs,

233
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:44,080
so they made a little veggie puree and hid it in his meatloaf.

234
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:44,880
And they're like, did you like that?

235
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:46,000
He was like, yeah, it was real yummy.

236
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:46,960
Thanks, mom.

237
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:48,800
She was like, there's cauliflower in that.

238
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:50,080
And he just goes silent and says,

239
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:52,400
don't you ever fucking do that to me.

240
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:54,960
Like, this boy's demeanor changed.

241
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:56,560
And in this moment, he was not bingo.

242
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:58,960
He was like, Mark, something like-

243
00:11:58,960 --> 00:11:59,600
Sounds different.

244
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:03,440
Don't you ever fucking do that to me again.

245
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:05,200
I agree.

246
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,840
Do you guys want a Yahoo?

247
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:09,120
Absolutely, Griffin.

248
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:10,240
Absolutely, I do.

249
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:13,040
This one was sent in by Rachel Rosen.

250
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:15,120
Game recognized that game for me real quick.

251
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:15,680
Thank you, Rachel.

252
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:17,760
It's by Yahoo Answers user JJ, who asks,

253
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:22,880
I see orbs when I play my guitar.

254
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:24,960
What?

255
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:27,440
Today, I saw something strange

256
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:29,680
while watching a recording of myself playing my guitar.

257
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:32,240
I recorded the video in slow-mo on my phone

258
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:33,840
to see the strings vibrate.

259
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:34,720
It's really cool.

260
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:35,200
Cool.

261
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:38,880
But I noticed a small white orb pop into frame

262
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:40,320
directly on my fretboard.

263
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:41,600
Started from the 15th fret

264
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:43,600
and traveled down the neck to the fifth fret.

265
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:45,040
It moved fast as hell too.

266
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:47,120
It reminded me of a shooting star the way it moved.

267
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:48,560
Then it hovered for a second

268
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:50,240
and then at a much slower pace

269
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:52,640
floated around the strings in a spiraling motion.

270
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:53,680
Was it just dust?

271
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:55,280
A spirit who wants to jam?

272
00:12:55,280 --> 00:12:58,160
I'd love to hear some theories on it.

273
00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:00,560
Oh, is that your first time seeing the spirit of music?

274
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:01,600
Yeah.

275
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:03,280
You know that's a literal thing, right?

276
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:06,080
Like there's a reason why Santana does what he does.

277
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:08,160
He can't help himself.

278
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:09,040
He can't help himself.

279
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:10,560
The spirit is moving him.

280
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:13,440
I mean, I love the idea of it as a spirit who wants to jam.

281
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:14,720
And it's like you watch that video

282
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:20,000
and you transcribe the orb's movements to like tabulature.

283
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,760
And then you're like, all right, let's try this out.

284
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:24,080
Today is gonna be the day that the...

285
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:26,720
Ah, it's Wonderwall, fucking orb.

286
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:29,360
The trick is it's always Wonderwall.

287
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:31,280
Oh, it is always, yeah.

288
00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:33,680
That's the only song the spirit of music is ever like.

289
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:36,960
The spirit of music has a very outdated taste in music,

290
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:38,080
which is very ironic.

291
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:40,400
My favorite running joke to do

292
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:42,880
is whenever I'm in a car and Oasis is playing

293
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:45,360
and it's either Wonderwall or Don't Look Back in Anger

294
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:46,560
because despite the fact that they're like

295
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:49,440
apparently the most popular British band since the Beatles,

296
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:51,520
like that's all the two songs they did.

297
00:13:51,520 --> 00:13:54,160
I just pretend like, oh, who is this?

298
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:55,200
I like this.

299
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,320
I like this kind spirit thing.

300
00:13:58,320 --> 00:13:59,680
What do you call this?

301
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:02,400
You gotta be careful with the spirit of music

302
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:04,960
because if I know anything from lore,

303
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:07,200
it's that those spirits,

304
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:10,560
they got no respect for human physical limitations.

305
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:11,360
Sure.

306
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:13,280
And they will make you play the strings too fast

307
00:14:13,280 --> 00:14:15,280
till your fingers bleed or dance too hard

308
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:18,000
till your toes fall off or something.

309
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,760
And they'll make you play Wonderwall

310
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:21,680
and they'll make you play Wonderwall

311
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:24,160
until your skin is just shredded

312
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:26,080
like you shredded those sick notes.

313
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:27,440
That's what happened to Pete Townsend.

314
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:28,400
He was bedeviled.

315
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:31,120
He was bedeviled every time he got on that stage.

316
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:32,800
I got blisters on my fingers.

317
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:34,240
Damn you, cruel spirit.

318
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:35,120
Please kill me.

319
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:36,160
Please.

320
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:37,280
I'm bedeviled.

321
00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:38,880
You think, but you gotta be good.

322
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:41,840
You gotta be like careful with that

323
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:45,680
because if you do wrong by the spirit of music,

324
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:50,400
if you were to say, I can't play this right now,

325
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:52,720
my fingers are falling off, then I leave you.

326
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:54,400
You know, it abandoned you

327
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:56,400
and forced you to create the music on your own.

328
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:59,040
Just like it happened to the Oasis brothers.

329
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:03,040
And Chinese democracy took that long because slash and axle.

330
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:05,280
And it still wasn't very good

331
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:08,000
because they couldn't really find that spirit again, could they?

332
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:10,480
They tried to fake it by like just,

333
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:12,240
those weren't notes.

334
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:14,160
Half of Chinese democracy is not music

335
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:15,600
because they couldn't do that.

336
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:16,400
So they had to fill it.

337
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:18,640
That's why there's so many Chris Tucker skits

338
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:20,720
on Chinese democracy

339
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:22,160
because they didn't have enough songs.

340
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:26,480
If you slow down, like put it in like 4,000 frames a second,

341
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:28,080
slow, slow, slow-mo,

342
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:31,840
that video of 10 minutes of Axl Rose during a live concert

343
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:33,360
asking for some reggae,

344
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:36,320
you can actually see like the spirit of music

345
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:37,840
like fly into his mouth

346
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:39,840
and then it shines bright in his belly.

347
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:42,880
And then he just like in an ejaculatory scream,

348
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:44,720
just give us some reggae.

349
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:52,320
You know when they're working so hard on that album

350
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:53,760
and it took so long,

351
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:55,280
I kept telling them,

352
00:15:55,280 --> 00:15:59,680
guys, let's say you have half an album written and done,

353
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:02,720
just play them half as fast.

354
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:04,320
Play them like slower

355
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:06,000
and then you've got a full record, done.

356
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,440
Or just play them again.

357
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:10,240
But this time like do it with like British accents.

358
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:12,560
With a bit more reggae.

359
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:13,680
Here's the lineup.

360
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:15,440
Track one, Chinese democracy.

361
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:18,480
Track two, just playing around a Chris Tucker skit.

362
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:21,840
Track three, Chinese democracy.

363
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:23,280
Reggae mix.

364
00:16:23,280 --> 00:16:24,000
Reloaded.

365
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,120
Reggaeton mix.

366
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:26,400
Reloaded with reggae.

367
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:30,320
Do you guys think we're gonna inevitably end up

368
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:31,200
like the Gallaghers?

369
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:34,080
Gallagher one and Gallagher two.

370
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:37,520
Because I don't know if you follow those bros,

371
00:16:37,520 --> 00:16:40,560
but somebody, one of them retweeted like the other week

372
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:42,800
like fuck Noel for real.

373
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:45,680
Fuck this dude, I hate his guts.

374
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:47,840
It's like you guys made Wonder Ball together,

375
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:48,480
that's kind of weird.

376
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:51,760
Oh, he was saying that about his own brother?

377
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:52,260
Yeah.

378
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:56,000
And I'm worried like something's gonna happen.

379
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,640
That white beautiful orb of comedy is gonna leave us

380
00:16:59,280 --> 00:17:02,240
and then it's just gonna be like Travis can eat my butthole.

381
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:05,600
I don't think so, Griffin,

382
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:08,720
because I don't think the Gallaghers were actual brothers.

383
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:13,680
Interesting, clones then, huh?

384
00:17:13,680 --> 00:17:16,240
Yeah, or maybe just bound together by a dark secret.

385
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:19,200
Okay, they killed the third one.

386
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:20,320
Yeah, something like that.

387
00:17:20,320 --> 00:17:21,920
Okay, yeah, that's possible.

388
00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:24,640
They buried him in an oasis.

389
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:28,880
Isn't it weird how Noel and Joel Gallagher,

390
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:31,760
the oasis brothers hate each other?

391
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:34,560
And then Gallagher one and Gallagher two

392
00:17:34,560 --> 00:17:38,080
are brothers that also have like huge beef.

393
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:40,400
It's like, that's weird, right?

394
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:42,240
What is it with Gallagher brothers?

395
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:43,440
I don't know.

396
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:44,320
It's really weird.

397
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:46,240
Who were the second Gallagher brothers?

398
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:47,920
Gallagher one and Gallagher two.

399
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:49,040
Gallagher one and Gallagher two?

400
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:54,080
Yeah, the watermelon-based comedians.

401
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:56,240
Griffin, you know that this is not a joke

402
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:58,240
and that there are in fact two Gallaghers, right?

403
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:02,160
No, this is a joke from the comedy podcast

404
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:03,360
My Brother and My Brother and Me

405
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:05,840
that us three are gonna host until we hate each other.

406
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:09,040
No, this is 1000% real.

407
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:10,160
There's a new Gallagher.

408
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:14,400
Gallagher one, okay, I'll pay you the picture.

409
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:17,920
Gallagher one was seeing huge success smashing things.

410
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:21,200
His brother, in envy and perhaps wanting

411
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:23,120
to get his piece of the watermelon pie,

412
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:26,560
started touring as Gallagher two.

413
00:18:26,560 --> 00:18:32,240
Oh my God, this is like the real life prestige.

414
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:33,680
This is the prestige two.

415
00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:35,200
How do you know which one you're getting

416
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:36,960
when he says I love you to you?

417
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:40,560
How do you even know which fucking Gallagher it is?

418
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:43,600
Exactly, that was the exact problem.

419
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:48,480
The only thing that Gallagher asked Gallagher two,

420
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:51,600
his brother Gallagher, Ron Gallagher,

421
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:56,320
the only thing he asked him was to please don't do Sledge-O-Matic.

422
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:00,800
The siren call was too strong.

423
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:04,560
He got the, he already bought that big hammer.

424
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:07,840
Oh God, I want that scene in the movie where like,

425
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:09,280
he's like of course I won't do Sledge-O-Matic,

426
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:11,520
but it like pans out and you could see the Sledge-O-Matic

427
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:13,280
leaning against the wall behind the door

428
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:16,960
and like we know that he's gonna do Sledge-O-Matic.

429
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:19,760
This is gonna end with one of them getting hanged

430
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:21,600
and you, but you don't know which one

431
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:23,040
and right before he does it,

432
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:25,280
like a watermelon like falls out of his pocket

433
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:27,040
and rolls down the gallows stairs

434
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:31,040
and he just goes like, whammo, dead.

435
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:34,240
The classic, classic Gallagher phrase.

436
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:39,040
And then the other one fucking kills Batman.

437
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:42,800
Here's a question, I work at a startup

438
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:45,360
where one of the perks is a laundry service.

439
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:46,960
Once a week we can bring in a bag of laundry

440
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:48,640
for wash and fold, fuck.

441
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:51,120
I'm going on parental leave soon

442
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:53,120
and I have lightheartedly announced my intention

443
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:55,840
to drop by during my leave to drop off,

444
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:56,960
pick up my laundry.

445
00:19:57,520 --> 00:20:00,640
Here's the problem, everyone keeps acting like I'm joking.

446
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:06,400
I feel like if I ask outright,

447
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:08,640
I'm putting them in a position where they can't say no,

448
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:09,840
even if it's not okay.

449
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:13,920
Am I taking a work perk too far?

450
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:15,520
Is there a way to clear this up

451
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:18,560
without putting someone in an awkward position?

452
00:20:18,560 --> 00:20:20,720
And that's from Laundry Leecher.

453
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:23,200
My God, there's such an easy way.

454
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:25,040
What is it, Griff?

455
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:28,160
Don't do this thing.

456
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:29,280
Wrong.

457
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:30,960
I know I'm not technically on the clock,

458
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:33,280
I'm taking kind of a three year sabbatical

459
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:34,800
to kind of find myself.

460
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:36,480
Anyway, here's my dirty jeans.

461
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:38,900
Unless.

462
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:41,840
Oh, this is gonna be a tricky needle

463
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:44,240
and a tricky unless needle to thread, Travis,

464
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:45,280
but unless.

465
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:49,120
Here's the thing, is this perk a replacement

466
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:51,520
for like a normal benefit or pay?

467
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:52,880
I'm so funny.

468
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:54,000
No, hear me out.

469
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,720
If the startup was like, listen, we're new,

470
00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:59,200
we can't afford to pay you guys the salary

471
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:00,800
that a bigger company would,

472
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:05,120
but we have connections with this wash and fold place.

473
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:08,000
We got a deal through there so we can kind of balance out.

474
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,640
It's a cool hip perk of working with us, right?

475
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:13,280
So if that was guaranteed like once a week,

476
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:14,400
this is part of your thing

477
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:18,560
and you're taking paid leave, I think it's included.

478
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:21,440
I think it's a pretty shitty perk.

479
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:25,840
If you can't use it when you're on parental leave

480
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:27,600
and need it more than you've ever needed it

481
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:28,800
in your entire life,

482
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:32,800
I think that you should definitely do this thing

483
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:35,920
because you are going to need that very, very badly

484
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:38,480
and I think that you are well within your rights.

485
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:41,920
This is a thing nice, like good people worry about

486
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:44,160
that like normal people don't.

487
00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:45,840
Normal people would just roll up and like,

488
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:47,200
yeah, I just needed to check some mail

489
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:49,920
and happen to have some laundry with me, here you go.

490
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:51,680
Like the fact that you're worried about it

491
00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:53,360
means you're probably not that bad a person,

492
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:55,040
but you should still totally do it.

493
00:21:55,040 --> 00:21:56,800
No pun intended, there is a wrinkle here

494
00:21:56,800 --> 00:21:58,000
that we are not considering.

495
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:02,880
I can't imagine a scenario where I would want

496
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:04,800
all of the people that I work with

497
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:08,800
in my professional day-to-day to see what I do

498
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:11,680
to all my clothes, do you know what I'm saying?

499
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:12,560
I don't think you have to walk in

500
00:22:12,560 --> 00:22:16,480
and hold each piece up for them and just drop a bag off.

501
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:17,840
You walk in with the hamper

502
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:21,040
and like if you walk too close to somebody's desk

503
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:22,560
and you got some gym clothes in there,

504
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:25,680
I wouldn't, that's not, do you know,

505
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:29,280
I'm embarrassed of my dirty clothes.

506
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:33,280
You are definitely, if you do use this work perk,

507
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:35,200
you are definitely gonna be like

508
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:40,320
the deep web equivalent of a laundry load.

509
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:42,480
You are going to need like a dark load,

510
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:45,920
a silk road for your silk clothing

511
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:48,160
and all other clothing that are just,

512
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:52,000
the circumstances of which are just a little too dark

513
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,320
to bring to the company laundry service.

514
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:58,320
You need a Ray Donovan to smuggle your clothes in

515
00:22:58,320 --> 00:23:00,080
and he'll fucking wash them for you.

516
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:02,080
He won't fold, he doesn't fold,

517
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:03,920
you'll get him back, there'll be a big wrinkly mess.

518
00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:04,960
He doesn't do bleach

519
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:06,800
because he's worried about his own clothes.

520
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:09,120
He's worried about getting bleach on his fancy suits,

521
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:14,160
which is weird, but yeah, that's just Ray.

522
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:18,560
Ray, could you, could you bring your clothes in

523
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:21,920
and kind of covertly distribute them

524
00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:26,560
amongst your coworkers bags of laundry

525
00:23:26,560 --> 00:23:28,320
so no one would know you're doing it?

526
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:31,440
What is this dystopian workplace

527
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:33,360
where everybody just has all their stinky,

528
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:34,720
dirty clothes all over?

529
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:36,320
Wait, I got it, this is great.

530
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:40,240
Bring a load of laundry in and say,

531
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:42,160
hey guys, I just want to stop by and say,

532
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:44,880
hi, I'm on my way to do my own laundry.

533
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:47,200
I'm really tired and stuff, but I'm just gonna,

534
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:48,720
you know, I'm not working,

535
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:51,520
so I would just feel terrible to use the company service

536
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:54,800
and then forget, wink, and leave it there.

537
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:55,760
And what are they gonna do?

538
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:56,880
Are they gonna call you and say,

539
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:58,240
come get your dirty laundry?

540
00:23:58,240 --> 00:23:59,680
Are they gonna just like do it?

541
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:02,400
They'll just do it and you should connect so grateful

542
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:04,480
every time you do that for the next six weeks or so.

543
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:06,000
Oh, here's the problem, Justin.

544
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:07,280
If I'm-

545
00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:08,560
Oh wait, there's a problem with that?

546
00:24:08,560 --> 00:24:09,680
It's really good.

547
00:24:09,680 --> 00:24:11,200
If I'm reading this correctly,

548
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:14,720
unless they like deliver it to your home,

549
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:17,120
the problem is not in the dropping off laundry.

550
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:19,600
I think you can do that without drawing too much attention.

551
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:22,800
It's the picking back up your clean stuff

552
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:25,600
that really is gonna make you seem like a monster.

553
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:30,800
Like I literally came in just to get my clean laundry.

554
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:32,000
Bye, everybody.

555
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,600
Unless you make a big deal out of it.

556
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:35,600
Just like bury your face in that hamper

557
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:39,280
and just go like, oh man, they did a great job this.

558
00:24:39,280 --> 00:24:40,960
Everybody come sniff these.

559
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:41,760
Wonderful.

560
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:42,880
Anyway, bye.

561
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:45,920
This makes the difficulty of caring for an infant

562
00:24:45,920 --> 00:24:47,120
almost bearable.

563
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:48,160
Bye, everybody.

564
00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:48,960
Bye, everyone.

565
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:52,560
Is that the shitty part that like you took your leave

566
00:24:52,560 --> 00:24:53,600
to care for your baby

567
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:56,000
and now you're taking time away from your newborn

568
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,320
to drop off your shitty, dirty clothes?

569
00:24:58,320 --> 00:25:02,160
Well, even if I knew this,

570
00:25:03,280 --> 00:25:05,280
if one, I worked in an office

571
00:25:05,920 --> 00:25:10,160
and two, I just got started at a place like this.

572
00:25:10,160 --> 00:25:13,040
Even if I knew this was a thing,

573
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:17,120
if you think about like actually trying that

574
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:18,080
for the first time,

575
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:20,000
I am fairly certain I would never actually

576
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:21,280
be able to go through with it

577
00:25:21,280 --> 00:25:24,160
because I don't think I would be able to ask enough questions

578
00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:26,000
to figure out what the,

579
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:29,200
I would be so terrified of doing it wrong.

580
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:30,960
Like I would show up with a laundry basket

581
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:32,160
and everybody laugh at me like,

582
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:33,760
no, you drop it off at this place

583
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:36,000
or no, you can't put those clothes in there

584
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,600
or no, you gotta sort your clothes first.

585
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:40,480
I would probably just be so paranoid

586
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:43,200
about messing it up that I would end up doing myself.

587
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:45,360
And that's the McElroy way.

588
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:48,720
Don't try doing anything

589
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:51,120
because you'll probably get it wrong.

590
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:51,920
The first time.

591
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:52,800
The first time.

592
00:25:54,160 --> 00:25:56,240
So how am I supposed to dip this sushi in?

593
00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:58,400
Ah, fuck it, I'll just never eat sushi then.

594
00:25:58,400 --> 00:25:59,680
Burgers forever.

595
00:25:59,680 --> 00:26:01,040
Burgers, I guess, forever then.

596
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:06,480
I mean, I feel like I'm on fairly firm ground there

597
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:10,560
considering that like our dad once like ate the edamame

598
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:12,400
and ate all the shell

599
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:14,320
and everyone asked him where the shell in,

600
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:15,920
something in New York and everybody,

601
00:26:15,920 --> 00:26:19,120
this is a few years ago before edamame was like in vogue,

602
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:22,240
I guess, and everyone asked him where the shells were

603
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:24,160
and he laughed because he had eaten them.

604
00:26:24,160 --> 00:26:26,560
So it's like, I don't feel like I'm completely,

605
00:26:26,560 --> 00:26:29,120
I don't feel like my suspicion

606
00:26:29,680 --> 00:26:31,600
that someone of my genetic material

607
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:34,800
would get many things wrong very badly,

608
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:36,720
comically wrong the first time I tried them

609
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:39,520
is like out of, out of pocket.

610
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:39,920
Yeah.

611
00:26:39,920 --> 00:26:42,000
You know, they added something to the menu

612
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:43,760
where they actually do cook the shells around it now

613
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:44,480
at that restaurant

614
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:45,360
and you're supposed to eat the whole thing

615
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:46,560
and they call it Edadaddy.

616
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:49,680
All right.

617
00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:50,880
Do you guys want a yahoo or should we?

618
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:52,000
Yes.

619
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:53,360
Let's do a yahoo.

620
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:53,860
Yeah.

621
00:26:54,560 --> 00:26:58,000
This yahoo was sent in by level 9,000 YajruDruJru

622
00:26:58,000 --> 00:26:58,400
driving board.

623
00:26:58,400 --> 00:26:58,960
Thank you, Drew.

624
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:02,240
It's by Yajru Answers user Cain who asks,

625
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:05,520
who else can't stand fake OutKast fans?

626
00:27:07,280 --> 00:27:10,000
The ones that just put Andre 3000 and say,

627
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:11,120
oh, he's creative.

628
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:13,280
Have y'all actually listened to OutKast albums?

629
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:15,760
Andre 3000 is kind of like Kendrick Lamar,

630
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:17,440
observant and introspective.

631
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:20,160
He talks a lot about what was wrong with urban America,

632
00:27:20,160 --> 00:27:22,320
intricate rhyming and unique musically.

633
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:26,800
BS, ATE Aliens is the best OutKast album?

634
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:29,520
That's accurate.

635
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:30,160
That's sure.

636
00:27:30,160 --> 00:27:32,800
I mean, I'm more of a speaker box love below fan.

637
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:34,960
Although it was that really technically an OutKast album

638
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:36,560
because they were kind of divide and conquer.

639
00:27:36,560 --> 00:27:38,800
That was like an OutKast collaboration at that point.

640
00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:44,000
Anyway, yeah, I mean, they bug me when they don't get

641
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:45,120
the artistry that go into it,

642
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:51,440
but I am more annoyed by fake OutKast fans.

643
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:52,080
Do you get it?

644
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:52,880
Do you know what I mean?

645
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:56,240
Yeah, but it just seems like this person is presenting

646
00:27:56,240 --> 00:28:00,560
an argument of like OutKast wasn't just good,

647
00:28:00,560 --> 00:28:03,360
they were really good and expecting to get

648
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:05,600
some kind of argument back from people.

649
00:28:06,160 --> 00:28:08,080
No, I don't think you understand what I'm saying.

650
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:15,040
I'm talking about reploid, replicant OutKast fans.

651
00:28:15,040 --> 00:28:18,080
Genetically engineered OutKast fans.

652
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:23,840
People who are just like, hello, I enjoy Sanconia.

653
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:27,040
Yeah, I do like Sanconia though.

654
00:28:27,040 --> 00:28:29,440
Well, and that's what makes you real.

655
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:31,920
But like if I cut your hand open, it's gonna be red.

656
00:28:31,920 --> 00:28:33,520
It's not gonna be blue or something.

657
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:36,720
Well, I actually bleed OutKast.

658
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:38,320
Wait, or does that make me real or fake?

659
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:43,520
Hold on, do you build the fake OutKast fans

660
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:47,680
so that they know too much about OutKast?

661
00:28:47,680 --> 00:28:49,440
Like, are they like a Stepford wives thing

662
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:52,560
where it's like it's too perfect and they know too much?

663
00:28:52,560 --> 00:28:56,160
Or is it an imperfect duplicate of an OutKast fan?

664
00:28:56,880 --> 00:28:59,920
Maybe we're talking about fake OutKast fans.

665
00:28:59,920 --> 00:29:02,400
Sorry, let me try the fake OutKast fans.

666
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:10,800
Okay, so you're saying that when I had my OutKast tribute group.

667
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:14,800
Or we could also be talking about-

668
00:29:14,800 --> 00:29:15,760
Get OutKast too.

669
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:18,480
My OutKast tribute group OutKast too,

670
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:22,400
our fans are the people that this person had an issue with.

671
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:24,880
It could be a cover band, it could just be again.

672
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:27,280
Hello, I am Andre 3000.

673
00:29:27,920 --> 00:29:29,840
Hello, my name is big boy.

674
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:32,400
Sometimes my arm has been back.

675
00:29:33,280 --> 00:29:40,880
What if it's people who are fans of the podcast fake OutKast

676
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:45,360
that's all about like punk and then it's all about all the like prank shows,

677
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:49,120
the fake OutKast, the fans of that show, maybe they hate-

678
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:50,480
Now what shows are they gonna be talking about?

679
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:53,200
Cause Jamie Kennedy Experience, dead, punked, dead.

680
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:55,680
Although I hear rumblings of a punk too.

681
00:29:57,200 --> 00:29:59,920
Well, here's the problem with punk too, they can't do Sledge-O-Matic.

682
00:30:00,560 --> 00:30:01,520
Yeah, that's a good point.

683
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:06,080
Which is a good prank.

684
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:07,760
I mean, let's be honest, it's a pretty good punk.

685
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:09,840
Oh, I'm sorry, was that your watermelon?

686
00:30:12,160 --> 00:30:16,640
Maybe they have a problem with OutKast fans

687
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:21,040
that have been printed on a two-dimensional cardboard stand up.

688
00:30:21,040 --> 00:30:24,080
So when they go to greet them and discuss OutKast

689
00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:28,400
and they outstretch their hand to do the traditional OutKast secret handshake,

690
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:31,920
they just bump up into flat cardboard and they think,

691
00:30:31,920 --> 00:30:34,400
ah, I've been tricked again by a fake OutKast fan.

692
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:37,120
Maybe they have problems with the bootleg merchandise

693
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:42,080
where they want only OutKast branded fans to fan themselves with.

694
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:47,200
And they're buying like, it's spelled like O-W-T-C-A-S-T.

695
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:49,520
And they're like, wait, is this really an OutKast fan?

696
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:51,760
It's like, yeah, yeah, sure, $2.99.

697
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:54,960
And then they get it home and it falls apart the first time they try to use that.

698
00:30:56,880 --> 00:31:02,800
I saw Reploid OutKast back in like 2004.

699
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:04,880
Man, they were excellent.

700
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:07,360
What was your favorite song?

701
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:09,760
Probably Bombs Over Baghdad.

702
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:17,200
When they were like, I can move an elephant and silverback orangutans,

703
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:18,640
you can't stop a train.

704
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:21,520
And a lot of people didn't like the cadence.

705
00:31:21,520 --> 00:31:25,520
Like, I think the flow might be better in the original B.O.B.

706
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:28,480
But who wants something don't come in the paper,

707
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:29,920
it'll be there when I lean there.

708
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:35,280
I think there's a certain hauntingness to that that I really enjoyed.

709
00:31:35,280 --> 00:31:37,840
Also, at one point Andre 3000 opened up his mouth

710
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:40,400
and sparks shot into the audience for 15 minutes.

711
00:31:41,680 --> 00:31:43,200
Now that's my design.

712
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:45,760
That's actually part of the pyrotechnics of the show.

713
00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:49,920
It was the bridge of the song, the power music, electric revive.

714
00:31:49,920 --> 00:31:54,320
Just the two of them were like just barfing sparks and it was amazing.

715
00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:57,680
That's, Griffin, I know that you were painting a goof portrait.

716
00:31:57,680 --> 00:31:59,840
That sounds like it would be so fucking cool.

717
00:31:59,840 --> 00:32:00,880
No, it'd be the best thing ever.

718
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:04,640
10 years since the last OutKast studio album.

719
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:04,800
Jesus.

720
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:05,600
Did you believe that shit?

721
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:06,880
10 years this summer.

722
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:09,760
August 22nd, 2006 is Idlewild.

723
00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:14,560
I think Big and Andre are probably like locked in combat with the Reploids.

724
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:16,960
That's the problem.

725
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:19,200
They've been trying to eliminate the...

726
00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:20,880
Okay.

727
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:24,000
The Reploids did Idlewild, the movie.

728
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:28,320
TV networks out there, they're willing to make me a show about...

729
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:31,680
It'll be basically like supernatural,

730
00:32:31,680 --> 00:32:36,080
except it'll be the OutKast friends going around

731
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:40,800
and destroying clones and replicants and fake OutKast.

732
00:32:40,800 --> 00:32:46,240
And just trying to find time to like write a new, like construct a new album.

733
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:47,920
That'll be like a running gag.

734
00:32:47,920 --> 00:32:49,520
People are like, so how's the new album going?

735
00:32:49,520 --> 00:32:50,480
Are you fucking kidding me?

736
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:51,360
Are you kidding me, dude?

737
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:55,600
If we take like one day off, do you know how fucked you all would be?

738
00:32:55,600 --> 00:33:00,640
There would be a scene in this where real Big Boy, real Andre,

739
00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:05,120
they're fighting a Reploid duo and they take out Big Boy,

740
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:09,600
but then Replicant Andre grabs real Andre and they spin around on the ground

741
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:12,320
and they stand up and Andre 3000 is like,

742
00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:14,160
all right, Big Boy, we've been through a lot.

743
00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:14,960
You know it's me.

744
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:16,800
Let's just do some rhymes together.

745
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:18,720
And then the other one would be like,

746
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:21,440
no, it is me, Andre 3000.

747
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:22,400
Look at my hat.

748
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:24,080
Look at my hat.

749
00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:24,960
You know the truth.

750
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:28,320
Hey, shake it.

751
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:31,200
Shake it like a Polaroid.

752
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:32,880
You are, you have killed me.

753
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:35,360
Good choice, Big Boy.

754
00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:37,040
The second season is better.

755
00:33:37,040 --> 00:33:40,800
The first season of the show, they do a lot of like martial arts

756
00:33:40,800 --> 00:33:43,040
and every time they attack, they're like, hey, yeah.

757
00:33:43,040 --> 00:33:44,880
And it's like, all right guys, we did it.

758
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:46,560
Like once or twice would be fine.

759
00:33:46,560 --> 00:33:48,720
You've done it 115 times in season one.

760
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:49,760
Every episode.

761
00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:50,720
They're swarming us.

762
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:52,400
We can't stop them, Big Boy.

763
00:33:52,400 --> 00:33:53,440
We have to make the call.

764
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:56,320
Release the bombs over Baghdad.

765
00:33:57,600 --> 00:33:59,840
Andre like jumps a hundred feet in the air

766
00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:02,800
and then like takes out five Replicant Big Boys.

767
00:34:02,800 --> 00:34:03,520
Up there.

768
00:34:03,520 --> 00:34:05,360
And then he lands on the ground and Big Boy just goes,

769
00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:06,560
I like the way you move.

770
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:12,880
Let's go to the money zone.

771
00:34:24,400 --> 00:34:28,560
I'm hungry, but that's not a problem for me

772
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:33,680
because I have a fridge that has just been restocked

773
00:34:34,400 --> 00:34:36,160
full of the freshest ingredients,

774
00:34:36,160 --> 00:34:38,960
some of which I cannot even receive in my area

775
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:41,600
and recipes on how to turn these perfectly proportioned

776
00:34:41,600 --> 00:34:44,960
ingredients into delicious meals for my family.

777
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:45,760
And guess what?

778
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:48,880
All these meals cost less than 10 bucks per meal.

779
00:34:48,880 --> 00:34:49,760
God say the brand name.

780
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:50,800
Please, God say the brand.

781
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:53,040
Blue Apron.

782
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:55,680
Man, you really left me in suspense there.

783
00:34:55,680 --> 00:35:00,320
I dropped you in media revs into that particular advertisement.

784
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:01,920
I don't know where you guys,

785
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:03,920
I don't know what loop you guys are on right now.

786
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:08,800
Last night I made fried chicken with a kale slaw

787
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:13,680
and sweet potato wedges and hot honey.

788
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:16,160
That was fucking insanely good.

789
00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:17,120
So, so good.

790
00:35:17,120 --> 00:35:18,720
Blue Apron kicks ass.

791
00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:19,440
We all do it.

792
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:21,120
Like I don't get it for free.

793
00:35:21,120 --> 00:35:22,320
Like I pay for it.

794
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:25,040
Like it's not one of those like advertisers are sending us.

795
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:27,200
Like I pay for it because it's fucking exceptional.

796
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:27,840
Changed my life.

797
00:35:27,840 --> 00:35:30,720
I know how to cook now because of this thing.

798
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:31,760
It's so good.

799
00:35:34,080 --> 00:35:36,160
If you want to try it and you really, really should.

800
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:39,040
Here's just a couple of meals available in June.

801
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:41,520
Creamy shrimp fettuccine with salted green beans and spinach.

802
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:42,320
Yes, please.

803
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:45,440
Sweet chili chicken with Tinkerbell peppers, green beans, jasmine rice.

804
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:48,400
You know, what's cool is if you have certain things you don't eat,

805
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:50,080
they can do vegetarian meals.

806
00:35:50,080 --> 00:35:52,400
They can do not fish.

807
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:57,120
If you're not a fish person, they can, you're crazy, by the way.

808
00:35:57,120 --> 00:35:59,760
They're really talented musicians and great pop songwriters.

809
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:02,960
No, don't spread that bullshit around.

810
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:04,320
They are not good at all.

811
00:36:05,840 --> 00:36:06,320
Fuck you.

812
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:07,120
They got some really good parts.

813
00:36:07,120 --> 00:36:07,920
No, they don't.

814
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:08,880
You're wrong.

815
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:09,760
No, you're wrong.

816
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:13,280
I'm saying like, I prefer the studio stuff.

817
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:16,320
It does get a little noodley for me on like the live records,

818
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:18,080
but like they have really, I mean,

819
00:36:18,080 --> 00:36:20,480
Treyus Nation has really solid pop construction

820
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:23,200
when that's the sort of milieu he's working in.

821
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:24,880
I think it's dump.

822
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:28,880
And also like, well, that's a really great fucking attitude.

823
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:32,640
This is supposed to be a show for people to like feel good about.

824
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:34,560
And there are, I guarantee there's people who are like,

825
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:35,600
oh, well, fuck you very much.

826
00:36:35,600 --> 00:36:36,240
I should be clear.

827
00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:38,720
I've heard one fish song in my entire life.

828
00:36:38,720 --> 00:36:42,560
Hey everybody, if you're a fish fan, tweet at Travis right now

829
00:36:42,560 --> 00:36:45,120
and all week about your favorite fish songs

830
00:36:45,120 --> 00:36:47,280
until he's a fucking convert by the end of the week.

831
00:36:47,840 --> 00:36:49,680
Okay, I've only heard one song.

832
00:36:49,680 --> 00:36:50,480
Yeah, let me know.

833
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:52,000
Let me know what's good.

834
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:54,720
No, don't let him know.

835
00:36:54,720 --> 00:36:59,200
Open up the fucking whole prison cell block and flood him.

836
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:00,560
I summon the fish fans.

837
00:37:01,360 --> 00:37:03,280
All of my non-fish fans out there,

838
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:04,800
I need you guys to do the same thing,

839
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:06,160
but the Justin and Griffin.

840
00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:09,040
No, but we weren't being dingleberries about fish.

841
00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:10,320
Yeah, Travis, this is punishment.

842
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:11,520
We haven't earned it.

843
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:12,560
That's not punishment.

844
00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:14,480
It's having his fucking eyes open.

845
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:17,920
Check out, oh, and you should read Nathan Raven's book

846
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:19,920
about fish fans and ICP fans called,

847
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:21,040
You Don't Know Me But You Don't Like Me.

848
00:37:21,040 --> 00:37:22,880
It's really, really, that'll change your life too.

849
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:24,320
Anyway, check out this week's menu

That's blueapron.com slash my brother.

854
00:37:32,240 --> 00:37:34,640
Blue Apron, a better way to cook.

855
00:37:34,640 --> 00:37:36,480
Can I talk to you about Sheetz?

856
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:37,360
Please do.

857
00:37:37,360 --> 00:37:40,000
Justin, Justin, do you know anything about Sheetz?

858
00:37:40,560 --> 00:37:44,640
Yeah, it's a sort of a restaurant gas station hybrid

859
00:37:44,640 --> 00:37:48,400
in I guess the Midwest and Northeast.

860
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:50,000
Northeast may have been more Wawa, I guess,

861
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:51,840
but yeah, that's Sheetz.

862
00:37:51,840 --> 00:37:55,040
Did you know it can also be a thing that you put on a bed?

863
00:37:55,040 --> 00:37:55,760
True story.

864
00:37:56,560 --> 00:37:57,280
Tell me more.

865
00:37:57,280 --> 00:37:58,320
Well, here's the thing.

866
00:37:58,320 --> 00:38:00,320
If you just slept on your regular bed

867
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:01,760
without anything on it,

868
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:05,280
you get your nasty body stuff all over the bed.

869
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:06,080
And then what are you gonna do?

870
00:38:06,080 --> 00:38:07,440
Buy a new mattress every time?

871
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:09,440
No, I'm starting at square one here

872
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:12,160
to explain that Bowling Branch is an amazing company.

873
00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:16,480
So what you do is you put a thin layer of fabric

874
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:18,640
over your bed that could be washed and replaced

875
00:38:18,640 --> 00:38:20,640
so that you don't have to get a new bed

876
00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:24,320
every time like you drool or sweat or whatever.

877
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:28,400
And so Bowling Branch is the next evolution of Sheetz.

878
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:30,000
They don't care about thread count.

879
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:32,480
They care about quality material.

880
00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:33,680
Thread count is a myth.

881
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:35,600
Dry land is not a myth.

882
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:38,480
Neither is quality sheets from Bowling Branch.

883
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:42,160
They use high quality cotton to make you great sheets.

884
00:38:42,160 --> 00:38:44,160
And because they don't have overhead

885
00:38:44,160 --> 00:38:45,840
like some of the big stores,

886
00:38:45,840 --> 00:38:47,600
they're able to keep their prices down

887
00:38:47,600 --> 00:38:51,440
and get you amazing product at a very reasonable price.

888
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:54,400
So you can check it out online at BowlingBranch.com.

889
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:57,600

00:39:02,720 --> 00:39:04,720
I keep saying sheets, but it's towels, blankets,

893
00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:06,400

Sleep on a dream.

900
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:22,960
That's not their thing, but it is now.

901
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:24,400
It's pretty good.

902
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:27,520
I got a message, your personal message for Robert.

903
00:39:27,520 --> 00:39:31,040
And it's from Laura or Laura or Lara who says,

904
00:39:31,680 --> 00:39:33,920
happy 420, darling Robert.

905
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:36,560
My dearest Robert, it is time to blaze.

906
00:39:36,560 --> 00:39:41,200
We march for the front lines tomorrow, General Lee says.

907
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:43,200
I shall await your correspondence.

908
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:46,800
Please roll this letter up and smoke a fat Dubinsky with it.

909
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:51,120
Chief my love correspondence, Robert.

910
00:39:51,120 --> 00:39:53,760
Chief it up right.

911
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:56,880
Roll it only the way we used to roll it.

912
00:39:56,880 --> 00:39:59,680
My dankest love, Laura.

913
00:39:59,680 --> 00:40:02,720
Happy 420, darling Robert.

914
00:40:02,720 --> 00:40:05,680
Happy 420, darling Robert.

915
00:40:05,680 --> 00:40:08,560
The first four years have been rough, I can't lie.

916
00:40:08,560 --> 00:40:11,040
But here's to the next 20 being smooth sailing.

917
00:40:11,040 --> 00:40:12,880
I'm sorry this message is late.

918
00:40:12,880 --> 00:40:17,200
There's so much to love in these like four sentences

919
00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:19,440
or three sentences, holy shit.

920
00:40:20,320 --> 00:40:22,720
First of all, you're basically saying 24 years

921
00:40:22,720 --> 00:40:24,480
and then that's it, which is great.

922
00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:26,720
You wish them a happy 420,

923
00:40:26,720 --> 00:40:29,760
which is like really specific timing.

924
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:31,440
I'm hoping you managed to like work it out

925
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:33,680
so that this message was played directly at 420.

926
00:40:33,680 --> 00:40:34,960
Chief it up, blaze it.

927
00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:36,880
And then you apologize for the message being late.

928
00:40:37,600 --> 00:40:40,400
Which honestly all Jumbotron messages should conclude with.

929
00:40:41,680 --> 00:40:45,600
It should be like the sorry so sloppy of Jumbotron messages.

930
00:40:48,080 --> 00:40:50,960
Great message, let's see if this next one can compete.

931
00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:55,360
It's for everyone and it's from Sparkles.

932
00:40:55,360 --> 00:40:59,040
And the message is be cool like Blair.

933
00:40:59,040 --> 00:41:01,760
And the preferred timeframe for this message is

934
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:03,600
whenever I love and trust you.

935
00:41:05,120 --> 00:41:07,520
Yes, this is another very good Jumbotron message.

936
00:41:07,520 --> 00:41:10,080
You'll know the right moment.

937
00:41:10,080 --> 00:41:11,600
Which Blair are we talking about?

938
00:41:13,680 --> 00:41:15,840
Blair Walder from Gossip Girl maybe?

939
00:41:15,840 --> 00:41:16,800
That's probably it.

940
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:18,960
No, I think this is probably a real Blair

941
00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:22,000
that a person named Sparkles, maybe that's a pseudonym,

942
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:26,800
just wants everyone to know their friend Blair is really cool.

943
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:28,640
And I don't know anything about Blair.

944
00:41:28,640 --> 00:41:30,400
I mean, except for the fact that it's a cool name.

945
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:32,960
So I'll aspire to be at least as cool as the name is.

946
00:41:33,840 --> 00:41:35,920
Do you know there's a WikiHow article

947
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:38,400
called how to behave like Blair Waldorf

948
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:39,920
and it has eight steps to it?

949
00:41:39,920 --> 00:41:43,760
Like WikiHow, I think you don't fall outside the lines.

950
00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:46,000
I don't think that that's what your service

951
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:47,680
is supposed to be used for.

952
00:41:47,680 --> 00:41:50,800
I think you're probably getting a bit big for your breaches.

953
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:55,120
You know at the moment of Yahoo Answers passing

954
00:41:56,080 --> 00:41:57,360
there will be a quickening.

955
00:41:57,360 --> 00:42:01,920
Right, when somebody, when Marissa Mayer

956
00:42:03,360 --> 00:42:05,040
fucking beheads Yahoo Answers,

957
00:42:05,600 --> 00:42:06,800
which is the only way to kill it,

958
00:42:07,360 --> 00:42:09,040
there will be a quickening

959
00:42:09,040 --> 00:42:12,240
and WikiHow will receive the quickening.

960
00:42:14,640 --> 00:42:15,920
If there's gotta be a bidding war,

961
00:42:15,920 --> 00:42:18,400
if there's a bidding war for like the Yahoo.

962
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:19,200
I will kickstart it.

963
00:42:19,840 --> 00:42:23,040
This will be the thing we use our one token

964
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:27,280
of like Kickstarter support from listeners.

965
00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:29,280
We'll go to Roman Mars and we'll pick up our token

966
00:42:29,920 --> 00:42:31,920
so we can put it into the machine

967
00:42:31,920 --> 00:42:33,680
to get something crowdfunded.

968
00:42:33,680 --> 00:42:34,180
Yes.

969
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:38,240
So everyone be cool like Blair, I guess.

970
00:42:38,240 --> 00:42:38,740
Yeah.

971
00:42:39,360 --> 00:42:40,400
Hey, James.

972
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:41,440
Hey, Nick.

973
00:42:41,440 --> 00:42:42,800
Where are we right now?

974
00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:44,160
You're in the minority corner.

975
00:42:44,160 --> 00:42:45,600
Haven't you been here before?

976
00:42:45,600 --> 00:42:46,160
You know what?

977
00:42:46,160 --> 00:42:47,200
I think I have.

978
00:42:47,200 --> 00:42:48,560
Cause you're a woman.

979
00:42:48,560 --> 00:42:50,000
And you're a gay man.

980
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:53,360
And we're both black.

981
00:42:53,360 --> 00:42:54,960
And now that we're here in the minority corner,

982
00:42:54,960 --> 00:42:56,160
what should we talk about?

983
00:42:56,160 --> 00:42:59,360
How about race, gender, and sexuality?

984
00:42:59,360 --> 00:43:01,440
Ooh, and we can gossip about celebrities

985
00:43:01,440 --> 00:43:03,120
and I can quiz you on pop culture.

986
00:43:03,120 --> 00:43:04,720
Ooh, and we can have guests.

987
00:43:04,720 --> 00:43:07,280
We're gonna learn, laugh, and play.

988
00:43:07,280 --> 00:43:09,920
You know, that sounds a lot like Blue's Clues.

989
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:12,480
Only it's more black, gay.

990
00:43:13,040 --> 00:43:14,400
And ladylike.

991
00:43:14,400 --> 00:43:15,920
Minority corner with a K.

992
00:43:15,920 --> 00:43:17,040
Check us out.

993
00:43:17,040 --> 00:43:20,800
Cause the C was taken.

994
00:43:20,800 --> 00:43:21,600
Hey, read a question.

995
00:43:22,160 --> 00:43:25,120
My landlord recently had a fence erected around my house,

996
00:43:25,120 --> 00:43:26,960
including a gate that stands between my front door

997
00:43:26,960 --> 00:43:28,080
and the sidewalk.

998
00:43:28,080 --> 00:43:30,080
He lives on the block and really seems to enjoy

999
00:43:30,080 --> 00:43:32,560
making eye contact while walking up to my house

1000
00:43:32,560 --> 00:43:34,960
and closing the gate every time I failed to do so.

1001
00:43:34,960 --> 00:43:38,080
Oh, I've never spoke to the guy.

1002
00:43:38,080 --> 00:43:40,560
So it feels like a pretty weird power play to me.

1003
00:43:40,560 --> 00:43:42,480
Should I just hold my breath till I move away

1004
00:43:42,480 --> 00:43:43,920
or is it time to escalate?

1005
00:43:44,960 --> 00:43:45,520
So wait.

1006
00:43:45,520 --> 00:43:47,280
It's open in Iowa City.

1007
00:43:47,280 --> 00:43:49,360
Is this a situation where the landlord also lives

1008
00:43:49,360 --> 00:43:50,560
in this building?

1009
00:43:50,560 --> 00:43:51,760
It doesn't sound like it.

1010
00:43:51,760 --> 00:43:52,160
No.

1011
00:43:52,160 --> 00:43:53,040
Oh, he lives on the block.

1012
00:43:53,040 --> 00:43:55,360
So he like literally walks down to your street,

1013
00:43:55,360 --> 00:43:57,280
makes eye contact, shuts the gate.

1014
00:43:57,280 --> 00:43:59,760
Why the fuck do you care if the gate is shut or not?

1015
00:44:01,360 --> 00:44:03,520
I mean, I get, okay, well, let me ask you this, Griffin.

1016
00:44:04,160 --> 00:44:07,920
If you paid money to put a gate up and the gate was open,

1017
00:44:07,920 --> 00:44:09,760
wouldn't you think, well, why the fuck did I do that?

1018
00:44:09,760 --> 00:44:11,200
Right, but a gate, like it sounds like anybody

1019
00:44:11,200 --> 00:44:12,080
can just open the gate.

1020
00:44:12,080 --> 00:44:13,760
What are you protecting it from, cougars?

1021
00:44:13,760 --> 00:44:16,560
Are you the only person who lives in the house?

1022
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:21,120
This is very odd.

1023
00:44:21,120 --> 00:44:22,480
This is very strange.

1024
00:44:24,240 --> 00:44:25,680
Wait, wait, wait.

1025
00:44:26,240 --> 00:44:29,120
Do you think that when the landlord is closing the gate,

1026
00:44:29,120 --> 00:44:31,280
he's thinking, I don't want you to get out.

1027
00:44:33,280 --> 00:44:34,480
I don't know how gates work.

1028
00:44:34,480 --> 00:44:36,720
I need to keep you safe, my precious tenant.

1029
00:44:39,920 --> 00:44:42,080
It's a really weird power play in that

1030
00:44:42,080 --> 00:44:44,000
it doesn't assert any power.

1031
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:45,520
It's just a weird thing to do.

1032
00:44:46,800 --> 00:44:47,920
He's not looking out for you

1033
00:44:47,920 --> 00:44:50,480
unless you do literally live in cougar town.

1034
00:44:51,360 --> 00:44:53,840
Although I think even a lot of cougars

1035
00:44:53,840 --> 00:44:54,960
could probably figure out a way.

1036
00:44:55,680 --> 00:44:57,360
I mean, they could just World War Z it

1037
00:44:57,360 --> 00:45:00,480
and run at the gate until they form a cougar based stairwell.

1038
00:45:01,200 --> 00:45:02,240
You know what I mean?

1039
00:45:02,240 --> 00:45:05,520
But like, this is the weird thing about living in proximity

1040
00:45:06,160 --> 00:45:08,720
to people who like own a thing is

1041
00:45:08,720 --> 00:45:11,040
people get really weird hangups.

1042
00:45:11,040 --> 00:45:14,320
Like I used to get weird notes on this one place I lived at

1043
00:45:14,320 --> 00:45:19,840
where the woman who was sort of like living in the building

1044
00:45:19,840 --> 00:45:20,800
in a discounted rate

1045
00:45:20,800 --> 00:45:22,960
because she was sort of keeping an eye on it

1046
00:45:22,960 --> 00:45:25,040
and so would get like very overzealous.

1047
00:45:25,040 --> 00:45:26,560
So I'd get these weird notes like,

1048
00:45:28,480 --> 00:45:32,720
when you bring your Christmas tree back downstairs,

1049
00:45:32,720 --> 00:45:34,560
please make sure to shake all the dead needles off

1050
00:45:34,560 --> 00:45:35,120
before you do it.

1051
00:45:35,120 --> 00:45:37,360
And she would put it up there in like August

1052
00:45:37,360 --> 00:45:39,760
to like really make sure that we were thinking about it

1053
00:45:39,760 --> 00:45:40,640
for a very long time

1054
00:45:40,640 --> 00:45:41,680
or she put notes like,

1055
00:45:41,680 --> 00:45:44,720
please stop stealing all my laundry soap

1056
00:45:44,720 --> 00:45:45,680
and please buy your own.

1057
00:45:45,680 --> 00:45:46,560
You know, weird stuff.

1058
00:45:46,560 --> 00:45:47,680
Weird hangups like that.

1059
00:45:50,560 --> 00:45:52,320
When I lived in the West Virginia building

1060
00:45:53,200 --> 00:45:54,080
and I was, you know,

1061
00:45:55,360 --> 00:45:57,840
I don't wanna dad turn off the podcast

1062
00:45:57,840 --> 00:46:01,600
but I was, you know, hitting that Skywalker OG.

1063
00:46:01,600 --> 00:46:02,240
You know what I mean?

1064
00:46:02,240 --> 00:46:03,280
I don't.

1065
00:46:03,280 --> 00:46:04,720
Having some of that purple Urkel.

1066
00:46:04,720 --> 00:46:06,000
You know what I'm talking about?

1067
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:06,400
I don't.

1068
00:46:06,400 --> 00:46:11,840
So I did not realize until the day that we all moved out

1069
00:46:11,840 --> 00:46:16,160
that our landlord literally lived a floor directly above us.

1070
00:46:17,120 --> 00:46:18,000
Oh my.

1071
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:21,520
And they must have been like super chill about it

1072
00:46:22,240 --> 00:46:24,080
because we never received a knock on the door.

1073
00:46:24,880 --> 00:46:27,120
That is so much worse of a thing to do

1074
00:46:27,120 --> 00:46:29,040
than leaving your gate open.

1075
00:46:29,040 --> 00:46:30,560
Unless again, you do live in Cougar Town.

1076
00:46:31,840 --> 00:46:33,360
Why are landlords,

1077
00:46:33,360 --> 00:46:35,200
why are some landlords horrible

1078
00:46:35,200 --> 00:46:39,280
and some just love it when you party?

1079
00:46:39,280 --> 00:46:43,120
I had a landlord who was a very nice woman

1080
00:46:44,400 --> 00:46:45,680
and we lived in this apartment

1081
00:46:45,680 --> 00:46:47,520
for like five years in Cincinnati

1082
00:46:47,520 --> 00:46:49,280
who would routinely come over

1083
00:46:49,280 --> 00:46:50,560
just to like check in

1084
00:46:50,560 --> 00:46:52,720
and seemingly just to judge

1085
00:46:52,720 --> 00:46:55,520
where we would put our furniture in the house.

1086
00:46:56,160 --> 00:46:57,360
That's not how I do it.

1087
00:46:57,360 --> 00:47:01,040
Yeah, or like how we were caring for like our backyard

1088
00:47:01,600 --> 00:47:04,720
or what kind of deck chairs we had.

1089
00:47:04,720 --> 00:47:09,760
She was very judgmental in like a familial way.

1090
00:47:09,760 --> 00:47:10,800
Not like in a mean way,

1091
00:47:10,800 --> 00:47:14,560
but like you would expect your mom to check up on you.

1092
00:47:14,560 --> 00:47:15,920
It was very weird.

1093
00:47:15,920 --> 00:47:18,320
And I always wanted to just look at her and be like,

1094
00:47:18,320 --> 00:47:19,520
hey, I appreciate you.

1095
00:47:19,520 --> 00:47:21,120
And like, I give you money.

1096
00:47:21,120 --> 00:47:22,400
Please don't come over.

1097
00:47:24,400 --> 00:47:25,760
Please don't where you are.

1098
00:47:25,760 --> 00:47:27,600
Here's a weird part about this question to me

1099
00:47:27,600 --> 00:47:28,800
is that when they say that

1100
00:47:29,600 --> 00:47:31,680
he really seems to enjoy making eye contact

1101
00:47:31,680 --> 00:47:32,880
while walking up to my house

1102
00:47:32,880 --> 00:47:35,200
and closing the gate every time I feel to do so.

1103
00:47:35,200 --> 00:47:37,600
That's weird that they're doing that.

1104
00:47:37,600 --> 00:47:39,840
But like, what are you doing

1105
00:47:40,640 --> 00:47:42,240
that you are in a position

1106
00:47:42,880 --> 00:47:45,360
to make eye contact with the landlord

1107
00:47:45,360 --> 00:47:47,600
when they walk up your side?

1108
00:47:47,600 --> 00:47:49,840
Like, are you just like leaving the gate open

1109
00:47:49,840 --> 00:47:51,840
and then standing outside in your truth

1110
00:47:51,840 --> 00:47:53,840
and just waiting for them to come by

1111
00:47:53,840 --> 00:47:54,800
so you can make eye contact with them?

1112
00:47:54,800 --> 00:47:56,240
Another possibility.

1113
00:47:56,240 --> 00:47:56,960
That's possible.

1114
00:47:59,520 --> 00:48:00,640
I guess this is just an endorsement.

1115
00:48:00,640 --> 00:48:01,440
If you live in Huntington,

1116
00:48:01,440 --> 00:48:03,120
looking for a place to live, West Virginia is great.

1117
00:48:03,120 --> 00:48:04,240
West Virginia building is great.

1118
00:48:04,960 --> 00:48:06,880
They are just like, they're down with whatever.

1119
00:48:06,880 --> 00:48:08,560
Landlord will just like walk in and be like,

1120
00:48:08,560 --> 00:48:10,320
it smells like that good good in here.

1121
00:48:10,320 --> 00:48:11,280
Anyway, have fun, boys.

1122
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:13,440
And Rio Grande is like right downstairs.

1123
00:48:13,440 --> 00:48:15,040
Rio Grande is right downstairs,

1124
00:48:15,040 --> 00:48:17,200
which is like conducive to the good good.

1125
00:48:17,200 --> 00:48:19,920
And I think backyard is like right across the street, right?

1126
00:48:19,920 --> 00:48:20,960
Oh, yeah.

1127
00:48:20,960 --> 00:48:22,480
Yeah, and you got a,

1128
00:48:22,480 --> 00:48:23,600
there's a frozen yogurt,

1129
00:48:23,600 --> 00:48:25,440
tropical moon place right across the street.

1130
00:48:25,440 --> 00:48:27,360
Walking distance to the movie theater.

1131
00:48:27,360 --> 00:48:29,360
Yeah, there's two derelict movie theaters

1132
00:48:29,360 --> 00:48:31,200
that you can just go walk and throw rocks at.

1133
00:48:31,200 --> 00:48:31,840
It's awesome.

1134
00:48:33,120 --> 00:48:34,400
Things about she's co-creator,

1135
00:48:34,400 --> 00:48:35,360
Dwight Slappy lives there.

1136
00:48:35,360 --> 00:48:36,320
You can go hang out with him.

1137
00:48:36,320 --> 00:48:37,840
It's got a lot going for it.

1138
00:48:37,840 --> 00:48:39,120
It's got so much going for it.

1139
00:48:39,120 --> 00:48:40,800
So how about a Yahoo?

1140
00:48:40,800 --> 00:48:41,600
I'd love that, Griffin.

1141
00:48:41,600 --> 00:48:43,040
This one is sent in by Aaron Keys.

1142
00:48:43,040 --> 00:48:43,600
Thank you, Aaron.

1143
00:48:43,600 --> 00:48:48,960
It's by Yahoo Answers user Usman, who asks,

1144
00:48:50,080 --> 00:48:51,840
teaching internet, my uncle.

1145
00:48:54,080 --> 00:48:54,880
Hello, all.

1146
00:48:54,880 --> 00:48:56,640
Well, first, my English is not good,

1147
00:48:56,640 --> 00:48:58,000
but hope you can understand.

1148
00:48:58,000 --> 00:48:58,880
That's fine.

1149
00:48:58,880 --> 00:48:59,360
We'll get it.

1150
00:48:59,360 --> 00:49:02,960
Okay, my uncle wants to learn internet from me.

1151
00:49:02,960 --> 00:49:05,280
I'm using the internet since 2010,

1152
00:49:05,280 --> 00:49:08,720
and I have much knowledge about internet downloading

1153
00:49:08,720 --> 00:49:10,400
and searching, almost everything.

1154
00:49:10,400 --> 00:49:11,760
But I'm confused.

1155
00:49:11,760 --> 00:49:13,840
How can I teach him internet?

1156
00:49:13,840 --> 00:49:18,480
So I need your suggestion from where should I need to start?

1157
00:49:18,480 --> 00:49:19,840
How can I teach him internet?

1158
00:49:19,840 --> 00:49:20,400
Thanks.

1159
00:49:21,120 --> 00:49:22,800
I don't want to make it sound like we're laughing

1160
00:49:22,800 --> 00:49:26,080
at this person's message,

1161
00:49:26,080 --> 00:49:30,160
or the syntax of the message.

1162
00:49:30,720 --> 00:49:32,640
No, I guarantee that sounds better

1163
00:49:32,640 --> 00:49:35,280
than if I tried to write a message and say Spanish.

1164
00:49:35,280 --> 00:49:35,920
Yes, sure.

1165
00:49:37,840 --> 00:49:39,040
I'm laughing about like,

1166
00:49:39,040 --> 00:49:43,280
how do you really sit an old man down?

1167
00:49:43,280 --> 00:49:46,560
How do you sit your old uncle down and start?

1168
00:49:47,280 --> 00:49:50,000
Where do you start with the internet?

1169
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:52,320
You have a clean slate experience

1170
00:49:52,320 --> 00:49:54,000
where the first thing you show them

1171
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:57,600
will be the jumping off point for internet for them.

1172
00:49:57,600 --> 00:49:59,520
Because it's going to be like you sit them down

1173
00:49:59,520 --> 00:50:00,160
and they're like,

1174
00:50:00,160 --> 00:50:02,960
where do I put in the internet floppy disk?

1175
00:50:02,960 --> 00:50:04,640
And it's like, oh, Jesus.

1176
00:50:04,640 --> 00:50:05,120
Oh, my God.

1177
00:50:05,120 --> 00:50:07,920
I saved all my punch cards.

1178
00:50:07,920 --> 00:50:09,920
So we're literally at ground zero.

1179
00:50:09,920 --> 00:50:10,420
Okay.

1180
00:50:14,480 --> 00:50:16,080
How do you teach someone the internet?

1181
00:50:16,800 --> 00:50:20,400
Now, how do I save the internet when I'm done with it?

1182
00:50:20,400 --> 00:50:21,760
No, oh, Jesus.

1183
00:50:21,760 --> 00:50:23,920
But think of the power you have with like,

1184
00:50:23,920 --> 00:50:26,160
you have this lump of clay in front of you

1185
00:50:26,160 --> 00:50:28,560
and you can mold in their mind

1186
00:50:28,560 --> 00:50:30,720
their concept of the internet.

1187
00:50:30,720 --> 00:50:34,480
You could just take them to like three pictures of a cat

1188
00:50:34,480 --> 00:50:36,640
and a recipe for fried chicken

1189
00:50:36,640 --> 00:50:39,360
and say, and that's the internet.

1190
00:50:39,360 --> 00:50:39,840
That's it.

1191
00:50:39,840 --> 00:50:42,960
That's what all the fuss has been about.

1192
00:50:42,960 --> 00:50:44,160
That's all there is so far.

1193
00:50:44,160 --> 00:50:46,640
We're still waiting for people to put some more on there.

1194
00:50:46,640 --> 00:50:49,440
But so far, we're pretty happy with the start of it.

1195
00:50:49,440 --> 00:50:52,400
Anyways, no need for you to ever get on this again.

1196
00:50:53,440 --> 00:50:54,720
I imagine on the first day,

1197
00:50:54,720 --> 00:50:57,600
your pawpaw sits down at the computer

1198
00:50:57,600 --> 00:50:59,040
and you just laugh like, ha!

1199
00:50:59,040 --> 00:51:00,400
Yeah, you think you're ready for that?

1200
00:51:01,040 --> 00:51:02,240
No, no, stand up.

1201
00:51:02,240 --> 00:51:05,120
And then you throw a notepad and a pen and start there.

1202
00:51:05,120 --> 00:51:07,280
Start putting searches into that first

1203
00:51:07,280 --> 00:51:10,320
and then you'll be ready to ride the snake at some point.

1204
00:51:10,320 --> 00:51:10,800
Not now.

1205
00:51:10,800 --> 00:51:15,920
Yeah, I enjoy, actually, I'm coming back from a different place

1206
00:51:15,920 --> 00:51:17,360
because there is, we're laughing at this,

1207
00:51:17,360 --> 00:51:21,040
but there's certain knowledge that we possess about the internet

1208
00:51:21,040 --> 00:51:23,920
that goes beyond like, how do I find information?

1209
00:51:23,920 --> 00:51:25,040
How do I Google?

1210
00:51:25,040 --> 00:51:26,000
What is an email?

1211
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:26,720
How do I say?

1212
00:51:26,720 --> 00:51:29,760
There's stuff that you need to know about sort of the landscape.

1213
00:51:29,760 --> 00:51:34,240
And I think really the only way to educate an old, old man about all that

1214
00:51:34,240 --> 00:51:38,080
is to just throw them into that deep Tumblr,

1215
00:51:38,080 --> 00:51:40,160
into a deep old Tumblr

1216
00:51:40,160 --> 00:51:42,800
and let them kind of dig their way out from there.

1217
00:51:42,800 --> 00:51:45,680
I'm talking about literally restraining them to a chair

1218
00:51:45,680 --> 00:51:49,280
and say like, you can only stand up and leave this room and use the potty

1219
00:51:49,280 --> 00:51:52,080
once you've found your way out of this like,

1220
00:51:52,880 --> 00:51:59,040
SpongeBob SquarePants rule 34 Tumblr collection.

1221
00:51:59,040 --> 00:52:00,080
Have fun, grandpa.

1222
00:52:00,080 --> 00:52:02,880
Thanks for fighting in the Korean War for me,

1223
00:52:02,880 --> 00:52:05,920
but you need to get the hell out of escape from Tumblr, I call it.

1224
00:52:07,840 --> 00:52:10,560
That's a good way to get that going, I think.

1225
00:52:10,560 --> 00:52:15,920
You heroically piloted a helicopter to evacuate Vietnam War vets

1226
00:52:15,920 --> 00:52:17,120
and that was a great thing you did.

1227
00:52:17,120 --> 00:52:20,480
Now it's time to see if you can escape from a different place,

1228
00:52:20,480 --> 00:52:22,880
which is to say that deep Tumblr.

1229
00:52:23,920 --> 00:52:24,480
Wait, hold on.

1230
00:52:25,520 --> 00:52:31,040
I really enjoy that you piloted a helicopter to evacuate Vietnam War vets.

1231
00:52:31,040 --> 00:52:33,120
Like someone's fighting in the Vietnam War,

1232
00:52:33,120 --> 00:52:34,960
they're like, help, stop, I'm a veteran.

1233
00:52:34,960 --> 00:52:35,920
Like, yeah, I know.

1234
00:52:35,920 --> 00:52:38,480
That's what they did back in the Vietnam War.

1235
00:52:38,480 --> 00:52:40,880
Okay, you know what I'm saying.

1236
00:52:40,880 --> 00:52:44,000
And to be fair, he didn't say evacuated Vietnam War vets from Vietnam.

1237
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:44,240
Yeah.

1238
00:52:44,240 --> 00:52:45,520
Could have been somewhere else.

1239
00:52:45,520 --> 00:52:48,400
Could have been a building full of Vietnam War vets that caught on fire.

1240
00:52:48,400 --> 00:52:51,840
I also didn't say in 2008.

1241
00:52:55,360 --> 00:52:55,760
I think that's a good way to-

1242
00:52:55,760 --> 00:52:58,960
You evacuated all those Vietnam War vets even as they asked you to stop

1243
00:52:58,960 --> 00:53:00,560
because they were just in their houses.

1244
00:53:00,560 --> 00:53:02,080
Please, I'm fine here.

1245
00:53:02,080 --> 00:53:02,480
What if-

1246
00:53:02,480 --> 00:53:03,040
Thank you.

1247
00:53:03,040 --> 00:53:13,520
What if my thing though, they're at like an AARP party or whatever

1248
00:53:13,520 --> 00:53:16,720
and they're talking to their cohorts and their cohorts is like,

1249
00:53:16,720 --> 00:53:21,120
my grandson got me a Blackberry and I've been using it to be on the internet.

1250
00:53:21,120 --> 00:53:23,520
And then this Tumblr grandpa would just be like,

1251
00:53:23,520 --> 00:53:31,360
oh, let me show you this high res JPEG that I found of Patrick the starfish is hard cock.

1252
00:53:31,360 --> 00:53:34,000
And everyone's like, what are you doing?

1253
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:36,080
And he's like, no, this is internet.

1254
00:53:36,080 --> 00:53:36,800
My grandson-

1255
00:53:36,800 --> 00:53:37,600
This is all it is.

1256
00:53:37,600 --> 00:53:43,520
My grandson locked me in a shower, an unused basement shower

1257
00:53:43,520 --> 00:53:47,360
and wouldn't let me leave until I sort of discovered what internet was.

1258
00:53:47,360 --> 00:53:48,800
And this is it, it's the starfish is hard cock.

1259
00:53:48,800 --> 00:53:49,600
And I'm better for it.

1260
00:53:49,600 --> 00:53:51,280
Yeah, I know a lot of stuff now.

1261
00:53:51,280 --> 00:53:56,720
Can you imagine being like 86 and your grandson's showing you the weirdest shit

1262
00:53:56,720 --> 00:54:01,120
he can find on the internet and you stumble across what happens to you

1263
00:54:01,120 --> 00:54:03,520
what has always been your thing.

1264
00:54:03,520 --> 00:54:08,480
And you didn't know about it till you were 86 and you found it on like Reddit

1265
00:54:08,480 --> 00:54:12,480
and you're like, oh, I've wasted so much time.

1266
00:54:12,480 --> 00:54:14,720
On your deathbed, just like flipping through the Blackberry,

1267
00:54:14,720 --> 00:54:17,920
your grandson just got you and you end up on that deep Tumblr

1268
00:54:17,920 --> 00:54:19,840
and it's like, here's my Tumblr blog.

1269
00:54:19,840 --> 00:54:22,800
And it's all just the art of Squidward and he's got six dicks.

1270
00:54:22,800 --> 00:54:24,320
And you're like, that's it.

1271
00:54:26,640 --> 00:54:27,760
That's my gem.

1272
00:54:27,760 --> 00:54:33,040
That's my fetish I found.

1273
00:54:33,040 --> 00:54:37,360
I found, fly me to heaven, Squidward's six cocks.

1274
00:54:39,120 --> 00:54:40,160
You're squiggins.

1275
00:54:42,400 --> 00:54:50,000
Using this new technology, the only way we can solve this murder

1276
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:53,600
is to use your grandpa as a spirit medium.

1277
00:54:53,600 --> 00:54:56,880
Using this crystal orb, we'll be able to see the last thing

1278
00:54:56,880 --> 00:54:59,200
he saw with his eyes before his...

1279
00:54:59,200 --> 00:55:03,040
Oh my God, is this Squidward from the cartoon SpongeBob SquarePants?

1280
00:55:04,240 --> 00:55:05,120
Does he have six?

1281
00:55:05,120 --> 00:55:06,960
Does he have six hard cocks?

1282
00:55:08,160 --> 00:55:10,800
Can I get a count on these hard cocks?

1283
00:55:11,360 --> 00:55:12,960
One, two, three, four, five.

1284
00:55:12,960 --> 00:55:13,680
Oh, there's another.

1285
00:55:13,680 --> 00:55:14,400
Yeah, six.

1286
00:55:14,400 --> 00:55:14,900
What?

1287
00:55:16,080 --> 00:55:18,000
Oh no, now this is my thing too.

1288
00:55:18,720 --> 00:55:20,320
Oh no, it's like the ring.

1289
00:55:20,320 --> 00:55:21,040
It's like the ring.

1290
00:55:21,040 --> 00:55:22,000
Oh, Jesus.

1291
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:27,200
It's Squidward's climbing out of the ball.

1292
00:55:27,200 --> 00:55:28,800
You know, there are six of you.

1293
00:55:28,800 --> 00:55:29,840
Oh God, no.

1294
00:55:31,440 --> 00:55:35,040
But you can't, if you're the one who did it though,

1295
00:55:35,040 --> 00:55:37,920
you cannot let your family discover what you have done.

1296
00:55:37,920 --> 00:55:38,240
Oh no.

1297
00:55:38,240 --> 00:55:40,800
So it's gonna be very awkward when your grandpa dies

1298
00:55:40,800 --> 00:55:43,040
and the first thing you do is grab his phone

1299
00:55:43,040 --> 00:55:44,080
and throw it in the toilet.

1300
00:55:45,920 --> 00:55:48,080
Listen, this is all very sad,

1301
00:55:48,080 --> 00:55:50,880
but right now I need to throw grandpa's phone in the toilet.

1302
00:55:50,880 --> 00:55:54,240
It's like, this goes beyond a history purge.

1303
00:55:54,240 --> 00:55:57,520
If there's a chance that a single one of these bits or bytes

1304
00:55:57,520 --> 00:55:58,960
remains in the cookie cache.

1305
00:55:59,920 --> 00:56:01,520
Did anyone teach you about the cloud?

1306
00:56:01,520 --> 00:56:02,800
Please, you have to tell me.

1307
00:56:02,800 --> 00:56:04,400
Did anyone teach you about the cloud?

1308
00:56:04,960 --> 00:56:08,320
Your grandpa, like he requested,

1309
00:56:08,320 --> 00:56:11,360
will now have his ashes scattered at sea.

1310
00:56:11,360 --> 00:56:13,680
I'm just gonna chuck his blackberry in there too,

1311
00:56:13,680 --> 00:56:14,960
just so he's-

1312
00:56:14,960 --> 00:56:15,840
Just to be safe.

1313
00:56:15,840 --> 00:56:19,920
Just to be safe, so he can have it in Davy Jones' locker.

1314
00:56:19,920 --> 00:56:24,160
Hey, Stevie, I found all these printed off things

1315
00:56:24,160 --> 00:56:25,680
in your grandfather's room.

1316
00:56:25,680 --> 00:56:27,520
He printed stuff off.

1317
00:56:27,520 --> 00:56:28,480
Damn it, old man.

1318
00:56:29,280 --> 00:56:29,680
Damn it.

1319
00:56:30,640 --> 00:56:32,000
One step ahead of me.

1320
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:34,880
I know he just died, but I don't think I love him anymore.

1321
00:56:37,120 --> 00:56:40,240
He flew helicopters in NOM for you, I think.

1322
00:56:40,240 --> 00:56:40,960
For somebody.

1323
00:56:42,400 --> 00:56:46,240
But look at all these pictures of Squidward's rock hard six days.

1324
00:56:47,440 --> 00:56:48,880
That's my dad.

1325
00:56:48,880 --> 00:56:50,240
That's my dad did that.

1326
00:56:50,240 --> 00:56:51,120
It was my dad.

1327
00:56:51,120 --> 00:56:52,560
I don't have a dad anymore.

1328
00:56:52,560 --> 00:56:53,120
That's weird.

1329
00:56:53,120 --> 00:56:55,120
He's dead to me in so many ways now.

1330
00:56:56,720 --> 00:56:58,000
Yeah, I just kind of appeared.

1331
00:56:58,720 --> 00:57:01,120
I just kind of like showed up one day as a baby.

1332
00:57:01,120 --> 00:57:02,880
No dad, no dad involved.

1333
00:57:02,880 --> 00:57:03,520
No dad at all.

1334
00:57:03,520 --> 00:57:04,400
That's crazy.

1335
00:57:04,400 --> 00:57:05,200
I don't have a dad.

1336
00:57:07,200 --> 00:57:08,560
That's gonna do it for us.

1337
00:57:08,560 --> 00:57:10,000
Was that too provocative?

1338
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:14,320
I get tweets pretty regularly from people who are like,

1339
00:57:14,320 --> 00:57:16,800
I was on the bus and my headphones came on jacked

1340
00:57:16,800 --> 00:57:18,960
and then Griffin yelled something about Squidward

1341
00:57:18,960 --> 00:57:23,200
from SpongeBob SquarePants' six hard, hard ding dongs.

1342
00:57:24,640 --> 00:57:27,200
And now I got fired from the bus because I was driving it.

1343
00:57:28,560 --> 00:57:30,080
I think it's fine.

1344
00:57:30,080 --> 00:57:30,320
Okay.

1345
00:57:30,320 --> 00:57:33,840
I think if you're, I think late in the podcast,

1346
00:57:34,640 --> 00:57:37,040
things are usually gonna get the most ribald then.

1347
00:57:37,040 --> 00:57:37,440
I also think-

1348
00:57:37,440 --> 00:57:38,400
I think you probably know that by now.

1349
00:57:38,400 --> 00:57:40,400
I also think people will find it really adorable

1350
00:57:40,400 --> 00:57:43,040
that when we tried to come up with the most upsetting thing

1351
00:57:43,040 --> 00:57:44,480
one might find on the internet,

1352
00:57:44,480 --> 00:57:48,160
the best we could do was like SpongeBob erotica.

1353
00:57:48,160 --> 00:57:49,280
And they probably said they're going,

1354
00:57:49,280 --> 00:57:52,880
well, that's not, let me send you guys some links.

1355
00:57:52,880 --> 00:57:54,560
Please don't send us those links.

1356
00:57:54,560 --> 00:57:55,920
Please don't take my innocence away.

1357
00:57:55,920 --> 00:57:57,680
Travis, you don't know how internet works.

1358
00:57:57,680 --> 00:57:59,520
Cause now we are going to get those links.

1359
00:58:03,120 --> 00:58:04,160
So we're done.

1360
00:58:04,160 --> 00:58:04,960
We're done.

1361
00:58:04,960 --> 00:58:05,840
With the podcast.

1362
00:58:05,840 --> 00:58:06,800
I hope you liked it.

1363
00:58:07,600 --> 00:58:08,720
We made it for you.

1364
00:58:08,720 --> 00:58:10,240
So that's, I mean, that's the hope.

1365
00:58:11,600 --> 00:58:14,000
And I wanted to say a quick thank you.

1366
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:18,560
We received a bunch of things in the old PO box

1367
00:58:19,760 --> 00:58:23,760
that I mean, like I had to fill the trunk of my car

1368
00:58:24,800 --> 00:58:26,720
with gifts.

1369
00:58:26,720 --> 00:58:28,240
Hey, bring some of those to Boston, please.

1370
00:58:29,280 --> 00:58:30,080
Okay.

1371
00:58:30,080 --> 00:58:33,600
No, when you guys come here later on this year,

1372
00:58:33,600 --> 00:58:34,560
you can take them with you though.

1373
00:58:34,560 --> 00:58:35,120
Yeah, okay.

1374
00:58:35,120 --> 00:58:36,400
I'm saving it in a closet.

1375
00:58:36,400 --> 00:58:41,520
Erica, it makes her own candles

1376
00:58:41,520 --> 00:58:48,720
and she made themed candles for our shows,

1377
00:58:48,720 --> 00:58:49,920
which is really cool.

1378
00:58:49,920 --> 00:58:52,480
She calls them, this is a cute, fandals.

1379
00:58:54,880 --> 00:58:56,480
What's the big gulp one smell like?

1380
00:58:57,760 --> 00:58:58,160
Okay.

1381
00:58:58,160 --> 00:59:03,680
That's not one of them, but she has a shop on Etsy

1382
00:59:03,680 --> 00:59:04,640
called Wick Habit.

1383
00:59:04,640 --> 00:59:08,000
And you can check out some of her candles there.

1384
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:09,440
All the ones she sent us smell great.

1385
00:59:09,440 --> 00:59:10,080
I'm saving them.

1386
00:59:10,080 --> 00:59:13,360
There's a rose buddies one that smells exactly like roses.

1387
00:59:14,160 --> 00:59:15,040
It's very uncanny.

1388
00:59:15,840 --> 00:59:17,680
But thanks to her.

1389
00:59:17,680 --> 00:59:22,960
Thank you to Matthew for sending me some Jimmy Buffett shoes

1390
00:59:22,960 --> 00:59:26,800
and thanks to Lynn for filming Jimmy Buffett saying hi to me.

1391
00:59:27,600 --> 00:59:30,080
That was very kind of him

1392
00:59:30,080 --> 00:59:32,480
and it made my father-in-law proud of me

1393
00:59:32,480 --> 00:59:33,680
for the first time in my life.

1394
00:59:34,240 --> 00:59:37,520
And also congratulations by the way,

1395
00:59:37,520 --> 00:59:40,080
because we won't record again till after this has happened.

1396
00:59:40,080 --> 00:59:44,240
Congratulations to Lynn on wrapping up his tenure in Hamilton.

1397
00:59:44,240 --> 00:59:46,240
His last performance is July 9th.

1398
00:59:46,240 --> 00:59:50,160
So congrats to him and what an accomplishment.

1399
00:59:50,160 --> 00:59:52,400
And also Blair sent us Dad Magazine,

1400
00:59:52,400 --> 00:59:55,280
which she edited and is a book called Dad Magazine.

1401
00:59:55,280 --> 00:59:56,560
So that's pretty great.

1402
00:59:56,560 --> 00:59:56,880
Thanks.

1403
00:59:56,880 --> 00:59:59,200
I want to say congratulations to you, Justin,

1404
00:59:59,200 --> 01:00:01,360
on your 10 year wedding anniversary, which is today.

1405
01:00:01,360 --> 01:00:01,840
Yeah.

1406
01:00:01,840 --> 01:00:02,480
The day we're recording the podcast.

1407
01:00:02,480 --> 01:00:03,600
Thank you so much.

1408
01:00:03,600 --> 01:00:04,160
Congratulations dude.

1409
01:00:04,160 --> 01:00:04,800
Thank you so much.

1410
01:00:04,800 --> 01:00:06,160
July 1st, it's been 10 years.

1411
01:00:06,160 --> 01:00:07,440
It's crazy.

1412
01:00:07,440 --> 01:00:08,800
I also want to say we're very, very excited.

1413
01:00:08,800 --> 01:00:10,000
We've got a guestbook coming up.

1414
01:00:10,640 --> 01:00:10,960
Yeah.

1415
01:00:11,520 --> 01:00:13,920
And it's been a while since the guestbook.

1416
01:00:13,920 --> 01:00:15,680
So just to remind you, we're going to have guests on.

1417
01:00:15,680 --> 01:00:18,720
You're going to submit questions specifically for that guest to answer.

1418
01:00:18,720 --> 01:00:20,800
That guest is going to be Patrick Rothfuss,

1419
01:00:20,800 --> 01:00:23,280
who is one of my favorite authors,

1420
01:00:23,280 --> 01:00:24,880
if not my favorite author,

1421
01:00:24,880 --> 01:00:26,400
author of the Kingkiller Chronicles.

1422
01:00:27,360 --> 01:00:28,000
And that's going to be,

1423
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:31,440
we're recording just a few days after this episode.

1424
01:00:31,440 --> 01:00:33,920
So if you've got questions for Patrick Rothfuss.

1425
01:00:33,920 --> 01:00:36,240
Advice questions.

1426
01:00:36,240 --> 01:00:38,880
Remember, like you need advice from him.

1427
01:00:38,880 --> 01:00:39,120
Yeah.

1428
01:00:39,120 --> 01:00:41,200
Not just like trivia questions or something.

1429
01:00:41,200 --> 01:00:42,160
The next book's coming out.

1430
01:00:42,160 --> 01:00:43,600
Please don't fucking ask that.

1431
01:00:44,240 --> 01:00:45,360
It's not cool.

1432
01:00:45,360 --> 01:00:46,240
Ask about advice.

1433
01:00:46,960 --> 01:00:50,320
But yeah, send those in and make sure to put in the subject line

1434
01:00:50,320 --> 01:00:52,080
something like, you know, for Patrick Rothfuss.

1435
01:00:52,880 --> 01:00:53,600
And speaking of-

1436
01:00:53,600 --> 01:00:54,640
Make sure, oh, sorry.

1437
01:00:54,640 --> 01:00:55,040
Go ahead, Jeff.

1438
01:00:55,040 --> 01:00:57,440
Well, we also have our Boston show coming up.

1439
01:00:58,480 --> 01:01:00,240
And so we're going to need questions for that.

1440
01:01:00,240 --> 01:01:04,320
So make sure you put Boston live show in the subject line for those.

1441
01:01:06,080 --> 01:01:09,840
And just want to remind you to send your favorite fish tracks to

1442
01:01:09,840 --> 01:01:12,240
at Travis McElroy on Twitter.

1443
01:01:12,960 --> 01:01:13,360
Definitely.

1444
01:01:13,360 --> 01:01:15,280
Maybe we want to start with something from like Billy Breeze,

1445
01:01:15,280 --> 01:01:16,720
something real accessible like that.

1446
01:01:16,720 --> 01:01:19,120
But, you know, it's up to you all, whatever you think.

1447
01:01:19,120 --> 01:01:22,640
And Travis will review each track and let you know what he thinks about it.

1448
01:01:22,640 --> 01:01:23,200
Yeah.

1449
01:01:23,200 --> 01:01:23,700
And-

1450
01:01:24,400 --> 01:01:26,640
We're all very excited to hear his book report.

1451
01:01:26,640 --> 01:01:27,680
Two things real quick.

1452
01:01:27,680 --> 01:01:29,120
Thanks to John Roderick and the Long Winters

1453
01:01:29,120 --> 01:01:30,640
for the use of our theme song, It's a Departure.

1454
01:01:30,640 --> 01:01:31,840
Off the album, Putting the Days to Bed.

1455
01:01:31,840 --> 01:01:33,280
Fucking fantastic album.

1456
01:01:33,280 --> 01:01:35,360
If you're going on a summer road trip, driving down to the beach,

1457
01:01:35,360 --> 01:01:36,160
put that album on.

1458
01:01:36,160 --> 01:01:36,720
Good times.

1459
01:01:37,360 --> 01:01:39,040
Also, I can't remember if I mentioned this last week,

1460
01:01:39,040 --> 01:01:41,040
but I just opened up a PO box here in Austin.

1461
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:46,000
It is PO box 66639, Austin, Texas 78766.

1462
01:01:47,600 --> 01:01:48,160
Yeah.

1463
01:01:48,160 --> 01:01:50,480
Just want to put that into the ecosystem.

1464
01:01:50,480 --> 01:01:50,880
Are we done?

1465
01:01:51,440 --> 01:01:54,080
I want to say check out all the other Amazing Maximum Fun shows.

1466
01:01:54,080 --> 01:01:55,760
There's lots of new ones to check out.

1467
01:01:55,760 --> 01:02:00,000
But I would like to take a second to specifically push two shows.

1468
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:02,160
One, the show that I do with my wife, Schmaners,

1469
01:02:02,160 --> 01:02:03,520
that I am a big fan of.

1470
01:02:04,080 --> 01:02:06,640
The episode we did on pregnancy is one of my favorite things

1471
01:02:06,640 --> 01:02:07,600
I've ever recorded.

1472
01:02:07,600 --> 01:02:09,760
And just every week, I'm more and more impressed

1473
01:02:09,760 --> 01:02:12,000
with how wonderful my wife is at podcasting.

1474
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:16,240
And also, the recent episode of Still Buffering,

1475
01:02:16,240 --> 01:02:18,880
where they had Lin Manuel Miranda on to talk about

1476
01:02:18,880 --> 01:02:21,440
like how to do theater in high school and as a teen

1477
01:02:21,440 --> 01:02:22,640
and community theater.

1478
01:02:22,640 --> 01:02:23,520
And it was wonderful.

1479
01:02:23,520 --> 01:02:26,160
They talked a lot about memories that I remember from growing up

1480
01:02:26,160 --> 01:02:27,680
in Huntington with the Smurls.

1481
01:02:28,480 --> 01:02:29,840
Lin talked about his years.

1482
01:02:29,840 --> 01:02:31,280
It's really wonderful.

1483
01:02:31,280 --> 01:02:31,680
It's super good.

1484
01:02:31,680 --> 01:02:32,320
I highly recommend it.

1485
01:02:33,680 --> 01:02:35,280
There are other shows on the Maximum Fun Network

1486
01:02:35,280 --> 01:02:36,480
that we are not a part of, though.

1487
01:02:36,480 --> 01:02:38,640
Like Getting Curious and Judge John Hodgman

1488
01:02:38,640 --> 01:02:40,640
and Jordan Jesse Goh and Stop Podcasting Yourself

1489
01:02:40,640 --> 01:02:41,520
and Throwing Shade.

1490
01:02:42,320 --> 01:02:43,360
Tons of great shows.

1491
01:02:43,360 --> 01:02:44,800
You can find them all at MaximumFun.org.

1492
01:02:44,800 --> 01:02:47,600
You can find all the podcasts that we do at McElroyShows.com.

1493
01:02:47,600 --> 01:02:49,840
We've been doing this post questions bit

1494
01:02:49,840 --> 01:02:51,040
for like 14 minutes now.

1495
01:02:52,080 --> 01:02:52,560
Let's kill it.

1496
01:02:52,560 --> 01:02:53,680
Let's put it.

1497
01:02:53,680 --> 01:02:54,560
Let's put it to bed.

1498
01:02:55,680 --> 01:02:56,400
Hit me, Griffin.

1499
01:02:56,400 --> 01:02:58,640
Got a final Yahoo is sent in by Aaron Keys again.

1500
01:02:58,640 --> 01:02:59,360
Thank you, Aaron Keys.

1501
01:02:59,360 --> 01:03:00,320
You deserve a nickname.

1502
01:03:00,320 --> 01:03:01,600
Just haven't come up with one yet.

1503
01:03:01,600 --> 01:03:02,480
We'll workshop it.

1504
01:03:02,480 --> 01:03:03,440
The Keys Master.

1505
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:06,000
I think you described you said keister once.

1506
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:08,480
And yes, I think Aaron tweeted that.

1507
01:03:08,480 --> 01:03:09,680
That was not good.

1508
01:03:09,680 --> 01:03:10,400
I know that.

1509
01:03:10,400 --> 01:03:12,640
That's why I've continued to try to come up.

1510
01:03:12,640 --> 01:03:13,920
I think Keys Master.

1511
01:03:13,920 --> 01:03:15,280
So I'm sticking with right now.

1512
01:03:16,080 --> 01:03:16,720
It's terrible.

1513
01:03:16,720 --> 01:03:17,440
OK, here we go.

1514
01:03:18,160 --> 01:03:19,360
Joe S. asks,

1515
01:03:19,360 --> 01:03:23,600
Does Seattle have culture, class, cuisine, opera,

1516
01:03:23,600 --> 01:03:25,840
all the stuff I see in Frasier?

1517
01:03:31,840 --> 01:03:32,880
Why are you Justin McElroy?

1518
01:03:32,880 --> 01:03:33,840
I'm Travis McElroy.

1519
01:03:33,840 --> 01:03:35,040
I'm Griffin McElroy.

1520
01:03:35,040 --> 01:03:36,000
It's been my brother, my brother and me.

1521
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:50,080
Kiss your dad square on the lips.
