1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,840
Hey, it's Griffin.

2
00:00:00,840 --> 00:00:01,920
Real quick before we get to the episode

3
00:00:01,920 --> 00:00:03,500
because we forgot to mention it.

4
00:00:03,500 --> 00:00:05,160
We have some new live shows to announce

5
00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:08,520
that we are gonna be doing at the end of November.

6
00:00:08,520 --> 00:00:11,200
We are going to be playing here in Austin, Texas

7
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:12,440
at the Moody Theater.

8
00:00:12,440 --> 00:00:14,920
On November 27th, we are doing MBMBAM

9
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:16,360
and then on the 28th,

10
00:00:16,360 --> 00:00:18,760
we're doing the Adventure Zone here in Austin.

11
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:20,320
And then for the first time ever,

12
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:23,360
we are going to Denver on November the 29th

13
00:00:23,360 --> 00:00:25,880
at the Temple-Hoyne-Buhl Theater

14
00:00:25,880 --> 00:00:27,720
and we're doing MBMBAM there.

15
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:31,640
So Austin, the 27th, doing MBMBAM, 28th, Adventure Zone

16
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:35,160
and then off to Denver for one more MBMBAM on the 29th.

17
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:37,160
And yeah, we're very, very excited.

18
00:00:37,160 --> 00:00:39,360
Well, I'm excited that I don't have to travel

19
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:40,360
for most of those shows,

20
00:00:40,360 --> 00:00:42,600
but I'm excited to get back up to Colorado.

21
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:44,840
So tickets for this are going to be on sale

22
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:48,680
for the public on Friday, September 14th

23
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:52,960
at 10 a.m. local time to where the venues are.

24
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:55,700
But we are also doing a fan pre-sale

25
00:00:55,700 --> 00:00:57,260
for tickets for these shows,

26
00:00:57,260 --> 00:01:00,320
which is going to be Wednesday, September the 12th

27
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:03,480
at 10 a.m. local time to Thursday,

28
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:06,160
September the 13th at 10 local.

29
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:08,440
And in order to access that pre-sale,

30
00:01:08,440 --> 00:01:10,840
which runs Wednesday through Thursday,

31
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:11,840
you have to enter a password.

32
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:15,400
The password is mybrother, all one word, all caps.

33
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:17,240
You type that in, you'll get some early access

34
00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:20,000
to a batch of the tickets for all those shows.

35
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,080
So that's it in November, Austin, Denver.

36
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:26,680
We're gonna tweet out links to all the ticket sales

37
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:28,600
for the different venues.

38
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:30,880
So keep an eye on our social media channels if you want it.

39
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:32,580
Again, they go on sale to public on Friday.

40
00:01:32,580 --> 00:01:35,480
There's a pre-sale Wednesday and Thursday

41
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:36,400
if you use mybrother.

42
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:37,600
Okay, that's it.

43
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:38,800
Here's the show.

44
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:41,440
The McElroy brothers are not experts

45
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:44,320
and their advice should never be followed.

46
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:46,680
Travis insists he's a sexpert,

47
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:50,060
but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

48
00:01:50,060 --> 00:01:52,400
Also, this show isn't for kids,

49
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:54,800
which I mentioned only so the babies out there

50
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:57,120
will know how cool they are for listening.

51
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:58,320
What's up, you cool baby?

52
00:01:58,320 --> 00:01:59,320
It's familiar, but not too familiar,

53
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:00,320
but not too not familiar.

54
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:01,320
It's a new craze, and good girls do you wanna just say,

55
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:02,320
hey, I wanna, just say, hey, I wanna.

56
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:03,320
Hello everybody, welcome to my brother and my brother's

57
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:04,320
show, the McElroy brothers.

58
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:28,320
I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy.

59
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:31,160
I'm your middle-est brother, Travis McElroy.

60
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:36,480
I'm your sweet baby brother and 30, oh, he got me.

61
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:37,480
Oh no.

62
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:38,480
Oh, shoot.

63
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:39,480
Oh, shoot.

64
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:40,480
Oh, shoot.

65
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:43,480
Griffin's blood and guts are everywhere.

66
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:47,360
Oh, bang, he got me, shoot.

67
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:48,520
The predator got me.

68
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:49,760
It's the Predator Watch 2018.

69
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:51,600
Griffin, can I ask you a question?

70
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:53,600
Did you see it coming?

71
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:54,600
I did not.

72
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:59,160
I did, I had on the thermal goggles that I can use

73
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:02,280
to see the predator when he comes towards me.

74
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:05,320
But the problem is he had just went to the Cold Stone Creamery

75
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:08,160
and had a gotta have it, gotta have it, gotta need it,

76
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:09,680
and he cooled his body way down.

77
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:12,920
So he was essentially invisible in every respect,

78
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:16,160
and then he got me with his arm swords,

79
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:21,320
and he got me just from butt to cheek, butt to like head cheek,

80
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:24,120
and he cut me all the way open half-wise.

81
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:25,120
Dancing cheek to cheek.

82
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:26,120
Yep, yep.

83
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:28,020
Folks, as you've almost certainly guessed,

84
00:03:28,020 --> 00:03:30,400
we got a Predator Watch on our hands.

85
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:33,760
After thinking that the predator was gone,

86
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:40,720
he's back on this one, and he is not pleased, okay?

87
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:41,720
Let's put it that way.

88
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:43,980
He is not excited.

89
00:03:43,980 --> 00:03:46,840
Take it from me, you are gonna wanna catch this predator.

90
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:47,840
Oh, yes.

91
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:50,920
Folks, the predator is not happy.

92
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:53,200
He has been out of the game for a while,

93
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:57,680
but he is back in full force in The Predator

94
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:03,560
a 2018 film coming out this year, I believe.

95
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:09,260
Now Griffin, a lot of people are buzzing about Glover.

96
00:04:09,260 --> 00:04:10,900
This new predator stars a gentleman

97
00:04:10,900 --> 00:04:13,120
whose name is Boyd Holbrook,

98
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:17,360
and he looks like a, you know, tall glass of water,

99
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:19,360
and he will be playing sort of the...

100
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:20,360
Predator.

101
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:22,400
No, no, he's the predator predator,

102
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:24,520
the one who predates the predator,

103
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:28,280
but he's playing sort of the Arnold archetype.

104
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:29,280
The predator-predator.

105
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:30,280
Yeah, no.

106
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:31,280
The predator-hunter.

107
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:33,240
Still wrong.

108
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:34,400
Predator-consumer.

109
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:35,720
The one who gets the predator,

110
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:40,080
and this role in Predator 2 is filled by Danny Glover

111
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:42,600
and or Gary Busey, depending on how you looked at it,

112
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:44,920
and obviously Predator 1, you had Arnold Schwarzenegger

113
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:47,760
and just a whole lot of just sort of thick-armed gentlemen

114
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:48,760
in that one.

115
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:51,480
The Predators, it's important to point out,

116
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:53,800
cast this sort of thick-armed gentleman role

117
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:57,840
as Adrien Brody, which it still seems...

118
00:04:57,840 --> 00:04:59,800
That's where we're going, huh?

119
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:00,800
That's where we're going, huh?

120
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:02,480
Just gonna go ahead and get him in the mix, huh?

121
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:04,400
Great, great, talented, talented.

122
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:05,400
Great and talented.

123
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:06,400
Arms?

124
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:07,760
Did he beef up a lot for that?

125
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:11,200
No, I mean, you could still fit about nine Adrien Brody arms

126
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:14,000
comfortably inside of one of Arnold's gloves.

127
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
You know what I mean?

128
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,760
Mm-hmm, yeah.

129
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:21,360
Here's two real names of characters in The Predator.

130
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:23,920
Quinn McKenna and Nebraska Williams.

131
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:25,720
Oh, I like that.

132
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:27,680
Good, very good.

133
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:28,680
I like that.

134
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:30,480
Here's some more names of characters.

135
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:35,880
Casey Brackett, Traeger, Baxley, Lynch, Niddles,

136
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:40,000
Keyes, Dupree, Sapir, Coyle.

137
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,120
There are just a lot of them like that.

138
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:46,800
I've never seen any Predator movies.

139
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:49,240
Seems like a good one to start out with is The Predators.

140
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:50,600
Yeah, The Predators.

141
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:52,080
I mean, I know, is The Predators,

142
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:55,600
that sounds like a sitcom starring Predators.

143
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:57,400
That would be so funny.

144
00:05:57,400 --> 00:06:02,320
Oh, like the Geico Cavemen, but with invisible alien guys.

145
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:04,520
They did Predator good.

146
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:06,800
Predator 2, love it.

147
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:08,840
Predators, I don't know.

148
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:09,840
Where are we at?

149
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:10,840
You've kind of lost me.

150
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:12,160
It's been 20 years.

151
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:13,560
Predators, OK.

152
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:15,280
And then this one is The Predator.

153
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:17,200
So I guess a lot of The Predators were like,

154
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:19,080
that's probably enough for us.

155
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:20,040
We're going to go.

156
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:22,880
And then one Predator was like, I'm going to kick it

157
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:25,680
and just kind of see where this all goes.

158
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:27,080
So the next one's going to be just-

159
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:28,240
They actually snuck it out

160
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:30,280
so that people wouldn't steal the film

161
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:31,960
by calling it a Predator.

162
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:32,800
And people were like, well,

163
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:33,920
I don't want to just see a Predator.

164
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:35,320
I don't want to see a Predator.

165
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:38,240
I want to see some Predators, the next sequel.

166
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:40,320
And this one's going to come out.

167
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:42,160
This one. A few Predators.

168
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:43,840
And in this one, they're going to go back to,

169
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:46,320
they're actually going to get Adam Brody in this one.

170
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:49,000
And he's going to be very sort of sardonic to the Predator

171
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,840
who will spit its acid at him.

172
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:52,320
Oh my God, can you guys imagine

173
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:57,320
what if they crossed Predators with The Predator?

174
00:06:58,120 --> 00:07:00,160
And I think they'd call it The Predators.

175
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:02,560
And I think it might go a little something like this.

176
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:04,240
There's not going to be an end to this joke.

177
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:06,200
There is not going to be a middle to this joke.

178
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:07,800
Glomgor, I'm home.

179
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:11,080
I don't know what like Predator naming conventions are.

180
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:13,600
No, Glomgor is maybe more or less it.

181
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:14,440
Okay.

182
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:18,480
Why can't they give The Predator a name?

183
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:21,360
I mean, most of the one is like, this one has dogs.

184
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:23,040
This one has two swords.

185
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:23,920
And that's kind of sort of,

186
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:25,320
this one is bigger than the other one

187
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:26,920
and sort of tears its head off.

188
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:29,040
This one has a bad credit score.

189
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:30,840
Anyway, The Predator, we're all very,

190
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:32,160
I feel like this is the first one

191
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:33,880
where you guys really aren't fucking excited about.

192
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:35,760
I have never, here's what I know.

193
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:36,840
Here's what I know.

194
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:39,960
They got masks and underneath their masks

195
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:41,680
are faces that look just like their masks.

196
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:43,320
But you know, now that I'm thinking about it,

197
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:46,040
that is generally how masks work.

198
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:48,680
If I take off a mask, it's generally human shaped.

199
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:50,520
Isn't that true for all of us though?

200
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:51,400
Oh, that's so deep.

201
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:53,200
I know that they can turn invisible.

202
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:54,480
They can see heat.

203
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:56,280
And so you put mud on yourself

204
00:07:56,280 --> 00:07:58,640
and that both is gonna protect you from the predators

205
00:07:58,640 --> 00:08:01,560
and also it's gonna soften your skin up real good.

206
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:05,120
They have, I think, lasers and swords.

207
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:06,440
They hate aliens.

208
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:07,280
They're-

209
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:10,840
Travis, you know, for someone who's ever seen these films,

210
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:12,920
are you trying to hustle me somehow?

211
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:14,640
Are you about to like bet that you don't know

212
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:16,880
about the Predator, but then you've seen all the movies

213
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:18,620
a million times and you're actually about to take

214
00:08:18,620 --> 00:08:19,920
all my lunch money?

215
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:23,600
No, Griffin, I've just watched TV ever.

216
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:24,440
Okay.

217
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:26,840
And so I've seen the references.

218
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:28,940
I love the Predator, okay?

219
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:33,160
This film, I am wild about, and Griffin's right.

220
00:08:33,160 --> 00:08:35,160
I haven't been letting my enthusiasm show through.

221
00:08:35,160 --> 00:08:38,580
That's the problem with the 2018 ironic detachment.

222
00:08:38,580 --> 00:08:40,200
I'm wild about the Predator.

223
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:41,160
Yeah.

224
00:08:41,160 --> 00:08:44,300
The movie, I saw the first one when I was too young

225
00:08:44,300 --> 00:08:45,140
to see it.

226
00:08:45,140 --> 00:08:47,880
Like everybody who saw the first Predator movie,

227
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:48,840
it was too young to watch it.

228
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:50,400
None of us were ready.

229
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:51,480
Got a little spooked.

230
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:53,760
We were all a little bit young to be seeing this one.

231
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:55,520
Trav, here's the story with this guy.

232
00:08:55,520 --> 00:08:59,840
He is not angry at us.

233
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:02,040
He's not disappointed in us.

234
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:03,360
He's just above us.

235
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:06,640
And so he hunts us like the dogs we are.

236
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:07,860
Wow.

237
00:09:07,860 --> 00:09:11,120
The Predator is the first one where we deserve it.

238
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:13,840
And I think that we all should welcome the Predator

239
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:15,840
and say, we get it.

240
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:18,240
Wait, is the Predator the hero of the movie?

241
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:20,120
It depends on how you look at it.

242
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:22,860
You gotta say, Predator, you take a turn.

243
00:09:22,860 --> 00:09:25,840
In this one, the Predator is the hero.

244
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:29,400
He is finally standing up to humanity

245
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:31,480
in a way that no one else has the guts to.

246
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:33,320
He's finally putting us in our place.

247
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:35,040
Well, think about how many movies there have been

248
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:38,400
where human beings eat a burger or have a steak or whatever.

249
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:39,760
And we're all fine with that.

250
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:42,800
So why do we have such a problem with the Predator

251
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:44,200
hunting us, you know what I mean?

252
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:46,200
We're hunting cows.

253
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:48,880
Can I tell you what happens at the end of Predator 2?

254
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:49,720
Of course you can, Justin.

255
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:51,000
Because it's like one of my favorite,

256
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,560
it's one of my favorite things.

257
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:56,820
So Predator 2 is about Danny Glover

258
00:09:56,820 --> 00:09:59,920
being hunted by Predator, right?

259
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:01,760
And Danny Glover turns the table

260
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:06,760
and manages to kill the Predator, right?

261
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:10,320
And then other Predators show up and they're like,

262
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:15,280
oh shit, nice, and they give Danny Glover an old gun

263
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:16,120
because he did such a good job.

264
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:16,960
Wait, what?

265
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:17,780
Yeah.

266
00:10:17,780 --> 00:10:20,040
They give Danny Glover an old gun

267
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:25,040
because he did such a good job and that's it.

268
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:27,440
Now, and he technically becomes a Predator.

269
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:28,720
They're saying like, now you are a Predator.

270
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:30,520
And what's great about that movie

271
00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:34,040
is they really wanted Danny to be like in it.

272
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:37,480
So they didn't tell him it was a movie.

273
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:39,080
So when they shot that scene,

274
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:40,720
yeah, Danny Glover got really scared,

275
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:42,440
but he was like, no, I'm gonna fucking fight back.

276
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:45,640
And they just like recorded it and let the camera roll.

277
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:47,400
It was very real and very visceral

278
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:50,040
and he killed the actor playing the Predator.

279
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:51,760
And then the other Predators came in,

280
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:52,800
were like, you're the Predator now.

281
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:54,280
And so now like Danny Glover,

282
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:56,200
he'll show up to set on like Angels in the Outfield

283
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:57,040
and be like, how are you doing?

284
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:58,480
And he's like, pretty good.

285
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:00,480
Just keeping an eye out for Predator work

286
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:04,000
because I'm not the Predator, but I am a Predator.

287
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,160
And so I will shoot all the aliens I see.

288
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:07,400
I hate them so much.

289
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:09,160
I didn't finish my story.

290
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:10,640
Okay.

291
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:15,120
The gun that Danny Glover is given by a Predator

292
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:20,120
was given to that Predator 300 years ago by a pirate.

293
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:21,960
Wait.

294
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:24,560
Because the, yes, that's right.

295
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:28,320
This old, old Predator made a pirate friend.

296
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:31,560
The pirate friend gave the Predator a gun

297
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:35,240
and then the Predator was so impressed with Danny Glover

298
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:37,400
that he gave him his old pirate gun.

299
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:38,520
Okay, wait, what?

300
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:41,040
That is not addressed in the film whatsoever.

301
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:43,160
It's handled in the backstory of the comics,

302
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:44,560
but it's true and amazing.

303
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:48,400
So Jack Sparrow gave this Predator a gun.

304
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:49,240
That's it.

305
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:50,600
Whoa!

306
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:53,880
I know, let's get into the advice.

307
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:54,840
I think we're ready for it

308
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:57,140
and I think we've all earned it.

309
00:11:57,140 --> 00:12:00,800
My boyfriend likes to buy old, empty wooden boxes

310
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:02,600
and containers from a thrift store occasionally.

311
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:05,000
And the other day I saw he had a new one.

312
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,320
I picked it up to look at it

313
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:08,120
and then with a panel click on his face,

314
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:11,840
he said, wait, there's weird stuff in there.

315
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:13,920
So obviously I immediately opened it

316
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:18,920
to find 30 or 40 little rubber replacement earbuds.

317
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:23,620
While this is an excessive number of earbuds,

318
00:12:23,620 --> 00:12:25,060
I wouldn't have thought that was weird.

319
00:12:25,060 --> 00:12:29,960
However, he legit panicked and told me it was weird.

320
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:31,760
So I don't know.

321
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:32,600
Help me, brothers.

322
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:34,040
Is this objectively weird?

323
00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:35,440
Why did he panic?

324
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:38,280
Should I be concerned about his apparent earbud hoarding?

325
00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:40,340
What could he possibly even use them for?

326
00:12:40,340 --> 00:12:44,080
I asked why he had them and he said, I don't know.

327
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:45,480
There's a lot of options here

328
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:47,000
and it's gonna be hard for us to fill in the blanks.

329
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,160
He could have thought that they were

330
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:51,360
little synthetic nipples maybe,

331
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:53,960
or maybe he eats these damn things.

332
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:55,000
He definitely eats them.

333
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,200
He definitely just pops them in.

334
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:58,960
He takes these, he scoops them up in a little Ziploc bag

335
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:01,280
and he'll go see the Predator at the theater

336
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:02,960
and they'll be like, snowcups, popcorn?

337
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:06,640
And he's like, no, I'm sneaking in some, uh-oh.

338
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:07,480
And they search him and they're like,

339
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:09,200
all you've got is this little bag of earbuds.

340
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:11,480
And he says, well, I'm not gonna eat those.

341
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:12,320
He does, though.

342
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:14,320
Then he coneheads out and he eats them up.

343
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:15,160
Mm.

344
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:17,840
Yeah.

345
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:21,800
Maybe, oh, it's also possible that right next to that box

346
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:25,080
was his box full of, I don't know,

347
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:28,640
teeth that he's found in the world or something,

348
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:31,640
because he tooth fairies teeth away

349
00:13:31,640 --> 00:13:34,240
and he thought you were reaching for that box

350
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:36,040
and he was like, oh, the rubber ears,

351
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:38,000
yeah, that's weird, ha ha ha.

352
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:41,840
And then on the other side of that box was like,

353
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:44,880
I don't know, magical stones that he's made.

354
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:47,760
He thought it was his tooth-haver box

355
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:50,080
where he has all the teeth that he gets.

356
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:51,160
I would love it if you were like,

357
00:13:51,160 --> 00:13:53,480
hey, wait, hold on, wait, give that a shake.

358
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:56,000
Okay, no, that's not the, I thought that was the tooth box.

359
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,520
That one's cool, that one's cool.

360
00:13:57,520 --> 00:13:59,160
That one's fine, actually, go ahead and open it.

361
00:13:59,160 --> 00:14:00,840
This one's kind of squishing around.

362
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:03,840
Uh, yeah, don't open that one.

363
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:04,680
Is it wet?

364
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:05,520
Is that box wet?

365
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:08,120
Nope, then you can open Sesame.

366
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:08,960
Go for it.

367
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:13,560
That's, give that a quick whiff.

368
00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:15,040
Hey, hold on.

369
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:17,960
Give that a quick whiff.

370
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:22,480
Do you know what a bunch of teeth smell like?

371
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:23,600
Ha ha ha!

372
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:24,560
You do?

373
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:25,600
Check that.

374
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:26,440
No?

375
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:27,320
It's not teeth then.

376
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:28,360
Why would you say that?

377
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:29,200
Why would you think it was teeth?

378
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:30,040
Why would you bring up teeth?

379
00:14:30,040 --> 00:14:32,600
Why do you keep, why do you keep talking about teeth?

380
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:35,160
Hey, I'm not the one, you're the one asking me

381
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:36,520
about teeth now, so like.

382
00:14:36,520 --> 00:14:37,920
You brought up teeth, I'm pretty sure,

383
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:39,080
let the record show.

384
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:42,800
So like, maybe you're the one obsessed with teeth, huh?

385
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:43,800
Yeah.

386
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:45,800
Let's rewind the tape and look at it.

387
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:47,200
What are you talking about?

388
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:49,600
Oh, that's my box of tapes that I collect over there.

389
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:51,080
That's my box of tapes.

390
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:56,640
I mean, you have not been lied to in this scenario.

391
00:14:56,640 --> 00:15:01,200
They asked if it's a, like, it is a weird thing.

392
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:02,040
It's weird.

393
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:03,680
It's weird enough that you wrote into us about it.

394
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:06,440
You brought it on our desk, so it is weird.

395
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:08,000
And you did ask them why they have it,

396
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,400
and they said they don't know,

397
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:12,920
which seems like another fair, non-lie answer.

398
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:13,760
They don't know.

399
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:15,800
They just kept them, because you never know.

400
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:17,520
I mean, that does seem like something

401
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:19,520
that you might have a utility for at some point.

402
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:21,600
Hold on, J-Man, because I was just sitting here

403
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:24,800
thinking about, I don't think you accidentally collect

404
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:28,400
30 or 40, because that means that, at the very least,

405
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:32,840
you have bought 15 sets of earbuds

406
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:34,920
and kept the replacements from them.

407
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:35,760
Well.

408
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:37,160
That just seems excessive.

409
00:15:37,160 --> 00:15:38,560
Those have gotta go somewhere,

410
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:40,480
because you buy a pair of earbuds at the airport

411
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:43,560
or whatever, and the first thing you do

412
00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:46,040
is you throw those extra ear jellies away,

413
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:48,720
because has anyone ever been like,

414
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:50,320
oh no, my ear jelly fell off.

415
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:52,640
Good thing I've got this replacement ear jelly

416
00:15:52,640 --> 00:15:54,440
to just slop right on there.

417
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:55,960
No, nobody's ever done that.

418
00:15:55,960 --> 00:15:57,320
Even if it doesn't fit in your ear

419
00:15:57,320 --> 00:15:58,680
and there's other sized ear jellies,

420
00:15:58,680 --> 00:16:00,520
it's like, that seems like a lot of work.

421
00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:03,240
I don't, you know, I'm not at the genius bar.

422
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:04,080
That's it.

423
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:07,100
I think, in this scenario, your boyfriend has a fear

424
00:16:07,100 --> 00:16:08,720
that one day they will wake up

425
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:10,640
and their ears will have shrunk.

426
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:11,480
Ah, yeah.

427
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:15,040
And they will need to replace all of their earbuds

428
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:16,780
with these smaller ones, and they don't wanna tell you that,

429
00:16:16,780 --> 00:16:19,560
because, listen, the chances of that happening

430
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:20,720
are one in a hundred.

431
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:24,360
So like, yeah, you don't really need to worry about it,

432
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:27,020
but like, one day you might wake up

433
00:16:27,020 --> 00:16:30,320
and your ears will be slightly smaller.

434
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:32,400
That was whimsical as fuck, Trav.

435
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:33,240
Really?

436
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:34,060
I feel like I'm on a roll.

437
00:16:34,060 --> 00:16:35,240
Dull story, dawg.

438
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:36,560
Fuck, dude, sick.

439
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:37,400
Here's a Yahoo.

440
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:38,220
It's from level 9000.

441
00:16:38,220 --> 00:16:39,560
Yeah, Drew, Drew, Drew Davenport, thank you.

442
00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:41,840
It's an anonymous Yahoo Answers user,

443
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:43,540
so I'm gonna call them.

444
00:16:43,540 --> 00:16:47,400
Playvus asks, the owner yelled at me?

445
00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:51,200
I went to a takeaway pizza place,

446
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:52,400
and as I was going in,

447
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:54,340
a seagull followed me into the place

448
00:16:54,340 --> 00:16:56,360
when I opened the door to look at it.

449
00:16:56,360 --> 00:16:57,960
When the seagull flew into the kitchen,

450
00:16:57,960 --> 00:16:59,480
the manager burst out yelling at me,

451
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:00,960
saying I had done something wrong.

452
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:04,160
There were no signs, so I don't think I did anything wrong.

453
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:05,320
I didn't get to order.

454
00:17:05,320 --> 00:17:06,880
Why would he yell at me?

455
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:10,020
Did you hold the door open for the bird?

456
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:14,940
This is the mystery I think we need to solve,

457
00:17:14,940 --> 00:17:16,440
maybe, before we go any further.

458
00:17:16,440 --> 00:17:19,720
I opened up the door to, when I was going into the place,

459
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:21,360
I opened the door to look at it,

460
00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:23,680
look at the pizza place, or look at the bird?

461
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:26,680
And then this asker says there were no signs.

462
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:29,520
Did you, so you're saying you had the conscious thought of,

463
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:30,640
I'm gonna let this seagull

464
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:32,560
right the fuck into this restaurant,

465
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:34,200
but because there's no sign saying,

466
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:38,280
hey, no big wild ocean birds in here.

467
00:17:38,280 --> 00:17:40,760
This is very much like an Air Bud scenario of like,

468
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:45,600
well, there's no rules against it, so I guess it's okay.

469
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:48,200
How much do we need to communicate to people

470
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:49,240
about what is it?

471
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:53,280
Can't we just have a big, just a big sign on life

472
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:55,440
that says, hey, don't let birds in here.

473
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:58,400
Or like just wild animals in general.

474
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:01,760
You know no animal can come in here.

475
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:05,340
Wherever here is, you probably can't let an animal in there.

476
00:18:05,340 --> 00:18:06,180
Like, period.

477
00:18:06,180 --> 00:18:07,880
I do wanna specify wild animal,

478
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:09,240
because if somebody wanted to bring in

479
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:12,160
like their cool pet, like boa constrictor,

480
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:14,240
yeah, you know, or like.

481
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:15,160
I'd love to see that thing.

482
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:16,000
I'm wild about that.

483
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,640
Yeah, I mean, or like a service animal.

484
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:18,480
I guess that's cool too.

485
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:21,760
We all wanna see Toby's big boa constrictor,

486
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:22,800
but he doesn't bring them around

487
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:24,480
except at parties and picnics.

488
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:27,320
Well, cause the boa constrictor doesn't like pizza.

489
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:32,200
Cause it can't, they like ball shaped stuff

490
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:33,580
that they can eat, you know?

491
00:18:33,580 --> 00:18:38,200
So they love calzones, or just like a ball of dough.

492
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:40,460
But you know, old man Pizza Tony

493
00:18:40,460 --> 00:18:41,760
won't give him a ball of dough,

494
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:43,880
cause he hates aminals.

495
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:44,840
Yeah.

496
00:18:44,840 --> 00:18:48,360
Don't let, I don't think we should let seagulls in it.

497
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:51,640
I tell you, we guys hate more birds or mice.

498
00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:52,480
Birds.

499
00:18:53,560 --> 00:18:54,480
Mice.

500
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:57,720
All right, well, I'll have to hate them equally.

501
00:18:57,720 --> 00:18:59,280
It's very rare that I have to worry

502
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:01,120
about a mouse hitting me in the face.

503
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:05,320
Sure, let's sympathize though for a second,

504
00:19:05,320 --> 00:19:08,520
because what happens if you do walk into the pizza place,

505
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:11,080
you do let just a huge fucking seagull.

506
00:19:11,080 --> 00:19:16,080
And some of these birds guys, they get awfully big.

507
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:18,720
And so they get into the pizza place

508
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:21,080
and they're scooping up pepperoni rolls and garlic knots

509
00:19:21,080 --> 00:19:24,440
and just like mouthing them down in one go.

510
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:27,280
And the manager gets mad at you and starts yelling at you.

511
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:30,160
And it's like, hey, this is my pizza place.

512
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:31,400
You've let a big bird in here.

513
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:33,120
How did you handle that energy?

514
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:37,920
You say, this seagull is rich.

515
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:38,760
Oh, yeah.

516
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:40,840
And like you're their driver, you know,

517
00:19:40,840 --> 00:19:42,160
you open the door cause they can't.

518
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:46,080
And then like the seagull pulls out its wallet

519
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:50,120
and like shames the shit out of old man pizza, Tony.

520
00:19:50,120 --> 00:19:53,040
So there's one problem is that they won't be able to,

521
00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:54,720
you could pull out the seagulls wallet

522
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:57,360
and be like, I carry the seagulls wallet for them.

523
00:19:57,360 --> 00:19:59,560
You understand Trav that a bird can't pull a wallet out.

524
00:19:59,560 --> 00:20:02,360
You're sounding a lot like old man pizza, Tony Griffin.

525
00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:07,280
How far do you take this?

526
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:12,120
Like the bird, oh no, this isn't my wallet.

527
00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:13,280
It's the bird's wallet.

528
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:15,000
You see, I work for the bird

529
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,140
and anytime they talk to your face,

530
00:20:17,140 --> 00:20:19,560
like please, please address the bird.

531
00:20:19,560 --> 00:20:21,080
Please address the bird.

532
00:20:21,080 --> 00:20:23,020
It drives him crazy when you talk to me

533
00:20:23,020 --> 00:20:25,320
like you're talking to him, please.

534
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:27,920
Then you open the door and a pelican flies in

535
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:30,020
and you're like, this is the bird's best friend.

536
00:20:30,020 --> 00:20:32,720
And he invited him out for a pizza lunch.

537
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:33,560
You're embarrassing me.

538
00:20:33,560 --> 00:20:34,400
He's also rich.

539
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:36,000
He's also really, really rich.

540
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,440
They're so fucking rich.

541
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:39,080
The pelican carries his own wallet

542
00:20:39,080 --> 00:20:42,280
because he's got that big, warbly mouth.

543
00:20:42,280 --> 00:20:45,560
So what, the seagull's gonna pay for them both?

544
00:20:45,560 --> 00:20:49,880
No, no, no, the pelican will pick up the tab.

545
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:50,720
The seagull paid last time.

546
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:52,400
Have you ever gone to lunch with a friend?

547
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:53,480
What's wrong with you?

548
00:20:53,480 --> 00:20:55,100
Come on, dude.

549
00:20:55,100 --> 00:20:56,840
This job's for the birds.

550
00:20:58,440 --> 00:20:59,360
What job?

551
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:00,200
Bird job?

552
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:01,040
Yeah.

553
00:21:01,040 --> 00:21:01,880
Yeah, okay, yeah, okay, I love it.

554
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:05,120
As the bird, like, translator.

555
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:07,160
God, fucking holy shit, guys.

556
00:21:07,160 --> 00:21:08,960
That was my best joke yet.

557
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:10,520
And you guys didn't like it.

558
00:21:10,520 --> 00:21:11,640
That was my best joke yet.

559
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:13,040
I'm gonna get tweets like, hey Griffin,

560
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:15,620
great episode, best joke yet on this one.

561
00:21:15,620 --> 00:21:17,520
And you guys didn't even like it.

562
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:18,960
And I thought you were really gonna like it.

563
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:19,800
I thought you were gonna laugh really.

564
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:20,620
Do you wanna try it again?

565
00:21:20,620 --> 00:21:21,800
No, I don't wanna try it again.

566
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:23,760
I just, I thought you were gonna laugh really hard at it

567
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:25,020
and you didn't like it.

568
00:21:25,020 --> 00:21:27,560
Could you let in an animal

569
00:21:27,560 --> 00:21:29,760
that is a natural enemy of the seagull

570
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:31,640
as a recompense for your misdeeds?

571
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:32,880
Like an octopus?

572
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:36,040
Could you let in an octopus to fight the seagull

573
00:21:36,040 --> 00:21:36,880
and take him out?

574
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:40,000
Oh, but then what if that octopus's translator's there

575
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,560
and it's like, this octopus is rich.

576
00:21:41,560 --> 00:21:43,640
And then old man Pete's attorney has to decide

577
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:44,840
which one to kick out.

578
00:21:44,840 --> 00:21:46,120
He's a pacifist.

579
00:21:46,120 --> 00:21:49,960
He's rich, this octopus is rich,

580
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:52,000
and he hates fighting people.

581
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:55,000
And this octopus and the seagull actually have

582
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,960
like a Romeo and Juliet star-crossed lovers

583
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:59,880
kind of thing going on, and it simply cannot be.

584
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:01,120
I mean, you got a little old lady

585
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:02,560
who saw the fly situation,

586
00:22:02,560 --> 00:22:05,360
which, I guess my problem with the little old lady

587
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:07,640
who swallowed the fly situation.

588
00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:09,000
Light her up.

589
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:13,040
At some point, don't you gotta just kinda stop?

590
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:14,560
Don't you gotta stop?

591
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:16,280
Like you swallowed a dog to get the cat

592
00:22:16,280 --> 00:22:19,220
and you gotta be like, I swallowed a dog, I'm done.

593
00:22:19,220 --> 00:22:20,060
I'm done.

594
00:22:20,060 --> 00:22:22,000
Swallowing the cat was really hard.

595
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,000
The cat was tough.

596
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,440
The cat was tough to get down sort of physically

597
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:27,640
and emotionally and ethically.

598
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:30,760
And then I tried to do a dog and I got there,

599
00:22:30,760 --> 00:22:32,440
and I think I just gotta walk away

600
00:22:32,440 --> 00:22:33,680
because there's not too many.

601
00:22:33,680 --> 00:22:34,680
First of all, what am I gonna,

602
00:22:34,680 --> 00:22:36,360
I'm gonna swallow a horse to get the dog,

603
00:22:36,360 --> 00:22:37,600
and that doesn't even make sense

604
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:39,680
because the horses don't eat dog,

605
00:22:39,680 --> 00:22:41,520
like they're not natural predators.

606
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:46,520
You can't, it's like, it is like I swallowed a dog

607
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:51,440
and it's in me, and I guess that that's it.

608
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:54,280
That is the end of it, is I have swallowed the dog

609
00:22:54,280 --> 00:22:57,680
and the situation is at least contained to me.

610
00:22:57,680 --> 00:23:01,040
I have more roads open to me, vis-a-vis a horse,

611
00:23:01,040 --> 00:23:03,680
but I just really, really,

612
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:06,880
I really think that's a bridge too far, even for me.

613
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:09,800
I tell you, the real problem with the little old lady

614
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:11,480
who swallowed a fly story,

615
00:23:11,480 --> 00:23:13,660
and this is the reason I'm not buying it,

616
00:23:13,660 --> 00:23:17,200
is whoever the bystander is who's observing this

617
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:22,200
and ruminating that perhaps this old lady will die.

618
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:23,020
Yeah. Mm-hmm.

619
00:23:23,020 --> 00:23:25,280
Hasn't taken the two seconds it would take

620
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:28,200
to explain to this old lady how digestion works.

621
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:29,640
Yeah, you're gonna.

622
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:31,100
She doesn't need to worry about it.

623
00:23:31,100 --> 00:23:31,940
Yeah.

624
00:23:31,940 --> 00:23:32,840
The fly's long dead.

625
00:23:32,840 --> 00:23:34,860
That fly's done. That fly is so dead.

626
00:23:34,860 --> 00:23:37,120
You're so fine, little old lady.

627
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:40,000
But see, this is the problem with today's YouTube culture

628
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,080
is that they are filming it for their channels.

629
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:43,600
They're gonna put it on the vine

630
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:45,080
and they're gonna put it on their YouTube channels

631
00:23:45,080 --> 00:23:46,580
and they're gonna get a lot of subscribers.

632
00:23:46,580 --> 00:23:48,120
This woman swallowed nine animals.

633
00:23:48,120 --> 00:23:49,080
It's great.

634
00:23:49,080 --> 00:23:51,160
Please like this. Hey, this is Brofist69.

635
00:23:51,160 --> 00:23:53,520
I'm doing the little old lady challenge today.

636
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:54,360
Uh-oh.

637
00:23:54,360 --> 00:23:55,200
Uh-oh.

638
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:56,020
Uh-oh.

639
00:23:56,020 --> 00:23:56,860
Uh-oh.

640
00:23:56,860 --> 00:23:57,700
Uh-oh.

641
00:23:57,700 --> 00:23:58,520
All right, here we go.

642
00:23:58,520 --> 00:23:59,360
Fly first.

643
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:00,960
Oh!

644
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:01,840
I went to a pet store

645
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:03,360
where they don't ask any questions.

646
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:05,200
Let's go.

647
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:08,040
I don't know why she swallowed the fly.

648
00:24:08,040 --> 00:24:09,500
I guess for the vine.

649
00:24:12,500 --> 00:24:13,660
Hey, it's me, the old lady.

650
00:24:13,660 --> 00:24:14,760
I'm back again.

651
00:24:14,760 --> 00:24:17,440
And today I'm swallowing the sickest shit yet.

652
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:18,280
Yeah.

653
00:24:18,280 --> 00:24:19,100
Film this.

654
00:24:20,280 --> 00:24:22,200
I wanna know in case anything happens to me,

655
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:24,840
I'll leave everything to my great grandmother

656
00:24:24,840 --> 00:24:25,960
who's still alive.

657
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:30,920
And she's been swallowing her whole life.

658
00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:33,080
It's for you, Gam-Gam.

659
00:24:33,080 --> 00:24:35,040
Today I'm gonna swallow the Constitution.

660
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:36,660
Don't at me.

661
00:24:36,660 --> 00:24:38,320
Today I'm swallowing the Predator

662
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:40,200
to get the human I ate last week.

663
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:42,120
But that's it,

664
00:24:42,120 --> 00:24:42,960
cause nothing,

665
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:45,080
and then I'm gonna get Danny Glover in there.

666
00:24:45,080 --> 00:24:46,440
But then that's it.

667
00:24:46,440 --> 00:24:47,800
Nothing can,

668
00:24:47,800 --> 00:24:48,640
that's the end of it.

669
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:49,460
Nothing.

670
00:24:49,460 --> 00:24:50,300
Nothing left.

671
00:24:50,300 --> 00:24:51,120
It's the end of the whole thing.

672
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:53,560
I've eaten everything that I can do.

673
00:24:53,560 --> 00:24:55,360
And then I'm gonna start streaming.

674
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:56,200
Hello, Brad.

675
00:24:56,200 --> 00:24:58,600
And then the stream will begin.

676
00:24:58,600 --> 00:25:01,320
I'm trying to consume Danny Glover.

677
00:25:01,320 --> 00:25:02,440
Maybe Fortnite?

678
00:25:02,440 --> 00:25:03,280
I don't know.

679
00:25:03,280 --> 00:25:04,340
Today I'm playing Fortnite.

680
00:25:04,340 --> 00:25:09,080
And I'm all fucked up on Danny Glover energy.

681
00:25:09,080 --> 00:25:13,000
I'm really full and I'm fucked up on it.

682
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:14,520
It made me feel crazy.

683
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:18,320
I'm getting the best headshots of my life right now.

684
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:21,960
And I have to eat Danny Glover before every stream.

685
00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:23,280
I've never played Fortnite,

686
00:25:23,280 --> 00:25:25,640
but Danny Glover is quite proficient at it.

687
00:25:25,640 --> 00:25:28,080
And he's in there sort of controlling the gizmos

688
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:29,860
and gears like a meat, Dave.

689
00:25:30,760 --> 00:25:34,520
How many spoonfuls of Nutella can I steal from the pantry

690
00:25:34,520 --> 00:25:36,540
before my roommate notices?

691
00:25:36,540 --> 00:25:39,400
The jar's about six inches tall from memory.

692
00:25:39,400 --> 00:25:40,640
Can't go measure right now,

693
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:42,120
cause he'll see me.

694
00:25:42,120 --> 00:25:45,560
That's from the Nutella Bandit in North Carolina.

695
00:25:45,560 --> 00:25:47,520
I picture you like in a closet right now

696
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:49,880
whispering this into your iPhone.

697
00:25:49,880 --> 00:25:51,320
Yeah, right.

698
00:25:51,320 --> 00:25:53,280
Activate speed tracking.

699
00:25:53,280 --> 00:25:58,000
Is there anything better than a fucking food heist, y'all?

700
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:59,800
Is there anything?

701
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:04,800
I do this literally every day where I go into the kitchen,

702
00:26:04,840 --> 00:26:07,480
maybe me and Rachel are playing with Henry

703
00:26:07,480 --> 00:26:09,280
and I go in the kitchen and get a glass of water

704
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:11,080
and I think, you know what would be good right now?

705
00:26:11,080 --> 00:26:12,840
Also a secret Oreo.

706
00:26:12,840 --> 00:26:14,680
And so I just kind of dig down and I'm like,

707
00:26:14,680 --> 00:26:17,320
oh, where's my, where's the,

708
00:26:17,320 --> 00:26:19,820
hey, hey babe, where's the nails?

709
00:26:21,920 --> 00:26:24,880
But I like get them, I get the Oreos instead of the nails.

710
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:25,960
The nails?

711
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:27,760
Yeah. The nails.

712
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:30,280
When I babysat, I babysat for a summer,

713
00:26:30,280 --> 00:26:32,080
two summers actually when I was living in Huntington,

714
00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:35,200
and that family always had Gushers

715
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:36,960
and they were the kids Gushers,

716
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:39,800
but I made them mine because of my actions.

717
00:26:41,680 --> 00:26:44,200
The Smurls at their new house

718
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:45,320
that they've lived in for a while,

719
00:26:45,320 --> 00:26:46,640
of course they always had like,

720
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:48,280
cause Riley was just growing up,

721
00:26:48,280 --> 00:26:50,560
they always had great kid treats.

722
00:26:50,560 --> 00:26:54,280
Their pantry was, you had to go through the guest bathroom

723
00:26:54,280 --> 00:26:55,680
to get into the pantry.

724
00:26:55,680 --> 00:26:59,000
Oops-a-daisy, did you just let me lock the door?

725
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:01,860
I can like, I can get rid of fucking fingerprints, y'all.

726
00:27:01,860 --> 00:27:05,040
Like it is the perfect, it is the perfect crime.

727
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:06,880
Are you sure you want to leave me?

728
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:09,280
Justin's been in the bathroom for four hours.

729
00:27:09,280 --> 00:27:10,680
Yeah, he has.

730
00:27:10,680 --> 00:27:12,400
He's scrubbing the plates.

731
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:14,080
Sticky from Gushers.

732
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:18,440
I, when I was a kid, man, I've never felt as guilty.

733
00:27:18,440 --> 00:27:19,360
Well, that's not true,

734
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:22,240
but this is one of the things I feel very guilty about.

735
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:25,320
I used to steal mom and dad's Weight Watcher desserts.

736
00:27:25,320 --> 00:27:26,520
Oh, me too, bud.

737
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:27,920
Ah, sick.

738
00:27:27,920 --> 00:27:31,080
Because I feel guilty because I was like 12

739
00:27:31,080 --> 00:27:33,560
and literally could have eaten straight lard

740
00:27:33,560 --> 00:27:34,680
and been fine.

741
00:27:34,680 --> 00:27:35,520
Yes.

742
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:37,120
But it was the very idea of mom and dad

743
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:39,960
would bring them home and say, don't eat these.

744
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:40,840
And then I would think like,

745
00:27:40,840 --> 00:27:42,520
well, I'm definitely going to do that then.

746
00:27:42,520 --> 00:27:43,360
I got to.

747
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:45,320
And I would always like try to figure out like,

748
00:27:45,320 --> 00:27:47,040
okay, well there's four in a box.

749
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:48,760
They've had one.

750
00:27:48,760 --> 00:27:50,500
So the box is already open.

751
00:27:50,500 --> 00:27:53,000
So if I take one, maybe mom will think dad did it

752
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:54,560
and dad will think mom did it.

753
00:27:54,560 --> 00:27:55,400
Ah, yum, yum, yum, yum.

754
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:57,720
And that's why our parents got divorced.

755
00:27:57,720 --> 00:27:59,600
Oh, that's not funny.

756
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:02,080
This is what is integral about this question.

757
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:07,080
And then this is the key fucking part of a food heist is,

758
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:10,960
well, you need motive and opportunity.

759
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:14,400
The motive is, I mean, a snack down.

760
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:16,440
And the opportunity is however you can get

761
00:28:16,440 --> 00:28:17,640
in the kitchen alone.

762
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:18,920
But then there's a math.

763
00:28:18,920 --> 00:28:20,080
There's a math to it.

764
00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:22,800
There's a Indiana Jones replacing the idol

765
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:23,720
with the bag of sand.

766
00:28:23,720 --> 00:28:24,840
You got it, you got it.

767
00:28:24,840 --> 00:28:27,880
There has to be a stealth aspect

768
00:28:27,880 --> 00:28:29,200
of they don't even know it's gone.

769
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:30,920
And this is how they,

770
00:28:30,920 --> 00:28:33,080
is there an amount of Nutella they could take that is-

771
00:28:33,080 --> 00:28:36,960
There are some stages at which you cannot eat the Nutella.

772
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:37,800
Sure.

773
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:41,840
Here, like the primary stage is it's closed, it's sealed.

774
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:42,680
Fresh jar.

775
00:28:42,680 --> 00:28:43,840
You definitely will notice the difference

776
00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:46,720
between unopened Nutella and open Nutella.

777
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:47,780
That's huge.

778
00:28:47,780 --> 00:28:51,520
There is also another bite that is completely off limits

779
00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:52,920
and that's it.

780
00:28:52,920 --> 00:28:55,440
That's the bottom of it, the end.

781
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:56,560
If you have the last bite

782
00:28:56,560 --> 00:28:58,480
and leave an empty Nutella jar in there,

783
00:28:58,480 --> 00:29:00,240
that's the biggest difference, I think,

784
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:01,080
basically in the world.

785
00:29:01,080 --> 00:29:02,880
Because you've taken the person from like,

786
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:05,680
I have Nutella, to I have no Nutella.

787
00:29:05,680 --> 00:29:06,640
That's massive.

788
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:08,240
The other thing you can't do though,

789
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:09,600
and you have to be very careful about this,

790
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:11,600
if they've tucked in the jar already,

791
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:14,640
you can't take the person from,

792
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:16,120
I have plenty of Nutella.

793
00:29:16,120 --> 00:29:18,560
I don't even have to think about Nutella for a while,

794
00:29:18,560 --> 00:29:22,040
to, dang, I'm kind of running low on Nutella.

795
00:29:22,040 --> 00:29:24,600
Because they will feel that as well.

796
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:26,360
You cannot make that change.

797
00:29:26,360 --> 00:29:29,480
You have to leave them feeling fat and happy

798
00:29:29,480 --> 00:29:30,840
as vis-a-vis Nutella.

799
00:29:30,840 --> 00:29:32,400
Okay, wait, I have a suggestion.

800
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:34,880
You could also though, you could leave them,

801
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:37,880
if they are already at, oh, I'm running low on Nutella,

802
00:29:37,880 --> 00:29:39,880
you could still have a couple scooper rolls

803
00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:42,480
and they'll still be like, I'm running, yeah, I'm staying.

804
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:44,280
I really need to go to the store.

805
00:29:44,280 --> 00:29:45,480
I'm really running low.

806
00:29:45,480 --> 00:29:48,240
It can't be 100, it can't be 50, or it can't be 0%.

807
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:53,240
You operate in the gray area between those checkpoints.

808
00:29:53,880 --> 00:29:54,920
Here's what you do.

809
00:29:54,920 --> 00:29:58,000
Every time your roommate has some Nutella,

810
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,160
and once they leave the room, they leave the kitchen,

811
00:30:00,160 --> 00:30:03,080
you go in and you're gonna get yourself 10%

812
00:30:03,080 --> 00:30:06,480
of however much Nutella they just had, right?

813
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:09,880
Because most likely, because what you can't do

814
00:30:09,880 --> 00:30:12,200
is like, they don't have Nutella for a week

815
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:14,560
and you keep kind of skimming a little bit,

816
00:30:14,560 --> 00:30:16,080
they might notice that.

817
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:18,720
But if every time there's just a little bit more missing

818
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:21,240
than when they had it, either that,

819
00:30:21,240 --> 00:30:24,480
or you need to mix some mud in there to re-expel it.

820
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:25,320
Some muddy in there.

821
00:30:25,320 --> 00:30:26,760
A little bit of mud. Get it back in.

822
00:30:26,760 --> 00:30:27,600
And once I said that.

823
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:29,480
It's not as good as it used to be when I was a kid.

824
00:30:29,480 --> 00:30:32,280
I realized you could have maybe done like peanut butter

825
00:30:32,280 --> 00:30:34,480
and I said mud, but like, where are you gonna get

826
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:35,600
peanut butter? Oh, this is, no,

827
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:36,800
this is great, Travis.

828
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:39,280
So you tuck a little peanut butter in there with the Nutella

829
00:30:39,280 --> 00:30:40,600
and then you get out a Sharpie

830
00:30:40,600 --> 00:30:42,160
and in your very best handwriting,

831
00:30:42,160 --> 00:30:45,080
you write now with peanut butter on the label.

832
00:30:45,080 --> 00:30:47,880
And you try and make it look super, super, super a fish.

833
00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:49,760
And the people come back and be like,

834
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:51,720
I don't remember, I have a peanut allergy

835
00:30:51,720 --> 00:30:52,920
and I tucked into this.

836
00:30:52,920 --> 00:30:55,160
And you'd be like, huh, better go to a hospital.

837
00:30:55,160 --> 00:30:57,040
I'll keep an eye on your Nutella.

838
00:30:57,040 --> 00:30:59,440
I guess you don't really have a peanut allergy then.

839
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:00,960
Yeah, find out what they're allergic to

840
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:02,400
and tuck some of that in there.

841
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:04,840
So you can be like Nutella, now with cucumbers.

842
00:31:04,840 --> 00:31:06,240
And you write that on the label and they'd be like,

843
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:08,120
oh shoot, I didn't notice this when I bought it.

844
00:31:08,120 --> 00:31:09,400
Oh well, do you want to eat all this?

845
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:13,800
And you say, you're already eaten it.

846
00:31:13,800 --> 00:31:17,520
Or you could invite the person from like across the hall

847
00:31:17,520 --> 00:31:19,800
over just for like a couple of minutes

848
00:31:19,800 --> 00:31:22,760
and then they're gone, but so's the Nutella.

849
00:31:22,760 --> 00:31:24,600
I love the secret ingredient thing.

850
00:31:24,600 --> 00:31:26,360
All you need to do in your whole life

851
00:31:26,360 --> 00:31:30,120
is always carry with you a tube of toothpaste

852
00:31:30,120 --> 00:31:33,680
and a sticker that says now with more toothpaste.

853
00:31:33,680 --> 00:31:37,880
And you can basically eat anything you want at any time.

854
00:31:37,880 --> 00:31:39,600
You just relabel it.

855
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:43,240
You've squeezed some toothpaste in to cover your tracks

856
00:31:43,240 --> 00:31:44,840
and then you slap that sticker on there.

857
00:31:44,840 --> 00:31:45,680
You're done.

858
00:31:45,680 --> 00:31:46,500
That's really good.

859
00:31:46,500 --> 00:31:50,720
Travis's idea was promising of bringing in a ringer.

860
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:54,480
And what I like is you can really play it up

861
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:56,840
and be like, this is my old friend,

862
00:31:56,840 --> 00:31:59,400
Stellan the sticky chocolate boy.

863
00:31:59,400 --> 00:32:01,360
And he was a foreign exchange student,

864
00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:02,440
stayed with my family for two years.

865
00:32:02,440 --> 00:32:04,280
We love Stellan and almost as much

866
00:32:04,280 --> 00:32:05,640
as he loves sticky chocolate.

867
00:32:05,640 --> 00:32:07,200
And y'all hang out for a bit,

868
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:09,360
watch the Big Bang Theory or whatever.

869
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:10,560
And then when Stellan leaves,

870
00:32:10,560 --> 00:32:13,000
the bottle of Nutella is gone and it's in your bedroom.

871
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:15,480
But your roommate's like, what the fuck?

872
00:32:15,480 --> 00:32:16,600
You'd be like, oh, I should have told you.

873
00:32:16,600 --> 00:32:18,520
That's one thing about Stellan.

874
00:32:18,520 --> 00:32:19,800
He'll get that chocolate, man.

875
00:32:19,800 --> 00:32:21,560
It's not even a question.

876
00:32:21,560 --> 00:32:23,640
Don't worry, he won't be over here again.

877
00:32:23,640 --> 00:32:25,120
No, we won't invite him again.

878
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:28,320
Okay, do we need another person for this?

879
00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:31,520
Or do you just need a very good disguise?

880
00:32:32,440 --> 00:32:36,520
Hello, hello, it's me, Stellan.

881
00:32:36,520 --> 00:32:40,560
I'm here, do not leave me near our chocolate.

882
00:32:40,560 --> 00:32:42,880
It is a warning, and they will.

883
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:44,160
Kitchen inspection.

884
00:32:46,160 --> 00:32:50,040
Maybe I am French, maybe I'm Belgian, it's hard to tell.

885
00:32:50,040 --> 00:32:53,000
Do not mind the sticky chocolate on my head,

886
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:57,760
and fingers, and face, and mouth, and cheeks.

887
00:32:57,760 --> 00:33:01,080
Au revoir, a bientot.

888
00:33:02,440 --> 00:33:04,040
Man, that dude didn't cross my front door,

889
00:33:04,040 --> 00:33:05,440
but I feel like he stole my Nutella.

890
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:07,320
Yep, he did, damn it.

891
00:33:07,320 --> 00:33:09,280
God almighty, he's good.

892
00:33:09,280 --> 00:33:10,760
Or we just take all these ideas

893
00:33:10,760 --> 00:33:13,480
and maybe the simplest option is just slap a sticker on there

894
00:33:13,480 --> 00:33:15,400
that says, now with less Nutella.

895
00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:20,160
I mean, the other thing you could do is like,

896
00:33:20,160 --> 00:33:21,280
hey, movie night.

897
00:33:21,280 --> 00:33:22,880
And they're like, hell yeah.

898
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:26,360
And then you put in The Predators.

899
00:33:26,360 --> 00:33:28,160
And then you're sitting there and you're watching it

900
00:33:28,160 --> 00:33:29,840
and you'd be like, hey,

901
00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:31,560
do you wanna eat some of that Nutella?

902
00:33:31,560 --> 00:33:32,960
And they're like, oh, that's a good idea.

903
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:34,360
And so they'll start eating the Nutella

904
00:33:34,360 --> 00:33:37,200
and be like, hey, let me get a scooper roll.

905
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:38,800
And then all of a sudden it's not a crime,

906
00:33:38,800 --> 00:33:40,240
it's like a friendship activity.

907
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:42,440
But you know, it is still a crime.

908
00:33:42,440 --> 00:33:43,280
I love that.

909
00:33:43,280 --> 00:33:46,080
Hey, y'all mind if we take a brief sojourn

910
00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:46,920
to the Money Zone?

911
00:33:46,920 --> 00:33:49,200
I would love that more than anything in the whole world.

912
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:54,200
You know how I like to start my day?

913
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:07,240
I slide it all into a pair of me undies.

914
00:34:07,240 --> 00:34:08,760
Wait, what's all of it?

915
00:34:08,760 --> 00:34:09,600
All of it.

916
00:34:09,600 --> 00:34:11,640
All the goods.

917
00:34:11,640 --> 00:34:13,040
And I slide them into.

918
00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:14,740
Like your butt and everything?

919
00:34:15,880 --> 00:34:18,640
As you're hearing this, I've had a vasectomy

920
00:34:18,640 --> 00:34:21,680
and boy was I happy to be able to slide on.

921
00:34:21,680 --> 00:34:23,340
And boy are my arms tired.

922
00:34:25,560 --> 00:34:28,440
These micro modal fabrics are the best place

923
00:34:28,440 --> 00:34:29,560
to put all of it.

924
00:34:29,560 --> 00:34:32,240
They release multiple fun prints each month,

925
00:34:32,240 --> 00:34:35,560
me undies does, in matching socks and bralettes.

926
00:34:36,560 --> 00:34:38,520
Hey, thank you Justin for specifying

927
00:34:38,520 --> 00:34:43,120
that it's not your bits that release fun matching prints.

928
00:34:43,120 --> 00:34:44,200
That means a lot to me.

929
00:34:44,200 --> 00:34:45,040
Thank you for clarifying.

930
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:46,840
If your bits release fun matching prints,

931
00:34:46,840 --> 00:34:49,200
please see a doctor as soon as you can.

932
00:34:49,200 --> 00:34:51,380
Me undies just launched a brand new membership.

933
00:34:51,380 --> 00:34:56,040
You can take your top drawer to the next level

934
00:34:56,040 --> 00:34:58,160
with new undies every month.

935
00:34:58,160 --> 00:34:59,760
Don't take your top drawer to the next level.

936
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:01,120
It's already the highest level it could be.

937
00:35:01,120 --> 00:35:02,040
It's your top drawer.

938
00:35:02,040 --> 00:35:03,240
You know what I'm saying?

939
00:35:03,240 --> 00:35:05,320
Why do you have no next to top drawer?

940
00:35:05,320 --> 00:35:06,240
No, see.

941
00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:07,080
No, see.

942
00:35:07,080 --> 00:35:08,440
You don't get it.

00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:10,360

00:35:23,560 --> 00:35:26,520
That's meundies.com slash my brother.

949
00:35:26,520 --> 00:35:29,240
I want to tell y'all about Boll and Branch.

950
00:35:29,240 --> 00:35:30,120
Please do.

951
00:35:30,120 --> 00:35:33,160
Yeah, they make super, super, super comfortable,

952
00:35:33,160 --> 00:35:38,160
soft, luxurious, loving things.

953
00:35:38,520 --> 00:35:41,600
And those things include bedding and blankets,

954
00:35:41,600 --> 00:35:44,360
and they are made from 100% pure,

955
00:35:44,360 --> 00:35:49,360
the finest organic cotton, which means they start out

956
00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:54,260
super soft and they get even softer as time goes on.

957
00:35:54,260 --> 00:35:56,320
And you're going to get older,

958
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:59,600
but these beddings never will.

959
00:35:59,600 --> 00:36:00,760
Wait, no, no.

960
00:36:00,760 --> 00:36:02,400
It doesn't say that at all, Griffin.

961
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:03,240
It says that.

962
00:36:03,240 --> 00:36:05,320
It says they're chrono time-locked.

963
00:36:05,320 --> 00:36:09,000
And that you're going to get older,

964
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:12,160
but they wash these sheets in the Tuck Everlasting Springs.

965
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:14,400
So they're going to be forever, forever young.

966
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:16,600
And they have thousands of five-star reviews.

967
00:36:16,600 --> 00:36:18,880
Forbes, Wall Street Journal, and Fast Company

968
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:20,960
are all talking about these Everlasting

969
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:22,600
Boll and Branch bedding items.

970
00:36:22,600 --> 00:36:23,680
And the shipping is free.

971
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:24,520
You can have them.

972
00:36:24,520 --> 00:36:26,600
You can try them for 30 nights if you don't love them.

973
00:36:26,600 --> 00:36:27,920
Then you send them back for a refund,

974
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:29,760
but you're not going to want to do that

975
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:32,600
because of how fucking soft and immortal they are.

976
00:36:32,600 --> 00:36:33,680
So to get started right now,

977
00:36:33,680 --> 00:36:36,640

00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:40,600
Oh, geez.

980
00:36:40,600 --> 00:36:44,640
50 cents, $50 off your first set of sheets.

981

991
00:37:02,240 --> 00:37:05,920
I would like to, I got a personal message here,

992
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:10,600
and it's for Jet Sam, Rivian Chillstep,

993
00:37:10,600 --> 00:37:13,720
Ernest P Braxton, and Mudd.

994
00:37:13,720 --> 00:37:17,560
And it's from Felicia Silvertongue.

995
00:37:17,560 --> 00:37:20,520
Thank you for ushering me into the world of tabletop gaming

996
00:37:20,520 --> 00:37:22,180
and into the McElroy universe.

997
00:37:22,180 --> 00:37:24,380
My life has become infinitely better

998
00:37:24,380 --> 00:37:27,200
since we joined forces on our first campaign.

999
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:30,640
I'm so glad we could take on Nashville to see the brothers,

1000
00:37:30,640 --> 00:37:32,640
search for the quintessential meatball,

1001
00:37:32,640 --> 00:37:34,720
and meet Mayor Kobe Bryant.

1002
00:37:34,720 --> 00:37:37,400
Stay strong, Denim Warriors.

1003
00:37:37,400 --> 00:37:42,400
I need to know how much of this happened in the real world

1004
00:37:42,440 --> 00:37:43,280
and how much of it is it?

1005
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:44,560
What was the Tom Hanks movie

1006
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:47,360
where he got like so into his D&D campaign

1007
00:37:47,360 --> 00:37:48,440
that he like went into a cave

1008
00:37:48,440 --> 00:37:50,320
and tried to do like spells and shit?

1009
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:51,160
Do you know what I'm talking about?

1010
00:37:51,160 --> 00:37:51,980
Wizard of the Warrior?

1011
00:37:51,980 --> 00:37:52,820
Wizard of the Warriors?

1012
00:37:52,820 --> 00:37:53,640
Do you know what I'm talking about?

1013
00:37:53,640 --> 00:37:54,860
I'm worried that this is that

1014
00:37:54,860 --> 00:37:57,680
because I don't know if Mayor Kobe Bryant

1015
00:37:57,680 --> 00:38:00,540
is like a major, major, major news item

1016
00:38:00,540 --> 00:38:01,880
that I missed out on.

1017
00:38:01,880 --> 00:38:02,720
It's possible.

1018
00:38:02,720 --> 00:38:03,720
Here's the thing.

1019
00:38:03,720 --> 00:38:06,420
The thing that's messed up about maybe my brain

1020
00:38:06,420 --> 00:38:08,520
and I think collectively all of our brains,

1021
00:38:08,520 --> 00:38:11,140
all of these jokes, like the quintessential meatball,

1022
00:38:11,140 --> 00:38:12,660
Mayor Kobe Bryant, Denim Warrior,

1023
00:38:12,660 --> 00:38:15,560
we could have said these in the Nashville episode.

1024
00:38:15,560 --> 00:38:16,640
Oh, fuck yeah.

1025
00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:19,600
But like I have no, that's all sent up to the cloud now.

1026
00:38:19,600 --> 00:38:20,440
I have no idea.

1027
00:38:20,440 --> 00:38:21,280
You're just saying so many jokes.

1028
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:22,920
That's in the cloud actually.

1029
00:38:22,920 --> 00:38:25,460
How about this next Jumbotron, Justin?

1030
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:27,720
Yeah, you know it.

1031
00:38:27,720 --> 00:38:29,200
Don't even test me.

1032
00:38:30,760 --> 00:38:33,480
It is a message for the Islanders

1033
00:38:33,480 --> 00:38:35,540
and it's from Jason AB and it says,

1034
00:38:35,540 --> 00:38:38,560
Dear Islanders, ever since joining the group,

1035
00:38:38,560 --> 00:38:40,360
I have met so many wonderful people.

1036
00:38:40,360 --> 00:38:41,680
Every day brings joy to my life

1037
00:38:41,680 --> 00:38:43,680
and interacting with you all has made me

1038
00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:46,120
a more confident and better person.

1039
00:38:46,120 --> 00:38:49,440
Here's to more meetups, selfies, jokes, and friends

1040
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:51,640
and helping each other navigate through life.

1041
00:38:51,640 --> 00:38:56,560
I can't wait to meet more of you in real space.

1042
00:38:56,560 --> 00:38:58,480
Is there a chance that this message

1043
00:38:58,480 --> 00:39:01,180
is for the New York Islanders hockey team?

1044
00:39:01,180 --> 00:39:03,400
Y'all have really made me feel a part of the team

1045
00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:07,200
because I am on it and thanks

1046
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:09,680
for batting the old puck around.

1047
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:11,780
I can't wait to meet you.

1048
00:39:11,780 --> 00:39:13,200
No pucking around.

1049
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:15,760
I wish I could meet the rest of the team.

1050
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:17,120
But you won't let me.

1051
00:39:17,120 --> 00:39:19,160
I'm only allowed to meet one of you at a time

1052
00:39:19,160 --> 00:39:22,080
in case it doesn't work out.

1053
00:39:22,080 --> 00:39:23,640
Here's one more Gumbo Trom.

1054
00:39:23,640 --> 00:39:26,880
This one is for Future Sara from Past Sara

1055
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:28,440
who says, Happy Birthday.

1056
00:39:28,440 --> 00:39:29,280
You did it.

1057
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:30,640
You survived a year in Florida

1058
00:39:30,640 --> 00:39:32,320
and you're about to move back to Texas

1059
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:33,600
where you know you belong.

1060
00:39:33,600 --> 00:39:36,800
I don't know if you're in Austin or Defebure,

1061
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:38,040
which I believe is Dallas, Fort Worth,

1062
00:39:38,040 --> 00:39:40,480
but what matters is you're back in the Lone Star State

1063
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:41,400
with your friends and family.

1064
00:39:41,400 --> 00:39:43,160
Past you is proud and a little jealous.

1065
00:39:43,160 --> 00:39:44,440
Okay, a lot jealous.

1066
00:39:44,440 --> 00:39:47,720
Enjoy that dry heat and barbecue.

1067
00:39:47,720 --> 00:39:50,960
And it seems like this happened this past summer.

1068
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:52,200
Congratulations, Sara.

1069
00:39:52,200 --> 00:39:53,160
Welcome back.

1070
00:39:53,160 --> 00:39:55,800
And like we say here in Texas,

1071
00:39:55,800 --> 00:39:57,740
we left a light on for you.

1072
00:39:58,920 --> 00:40:01,160
Hello, are you looking for a new comedy podcast?

1073
00:40:01,160 --> 00:40:03,040
In which case, can I draw your attention

1074
00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:05,840
to the Beef and Dairy Network podcast?

1075
00:40:05,840 --> 00:40:07,600
It's a fictional industry podcast

1076
00:40:07,600 --> 00:40:09,940
for the beef and dairy industries.

1077
00:40:09,940 --> 00:40:13,540
It won Best Comedy at the 2017 British Podcast Awards

1078
00:40:13,540 --> 00:40:16,760
and it features wonderful guests such as Greg Davis.

1079
00:40:16,760 --> 00:40:18,440
To my knowledge, it's the only cow circus

1080
00:40:18,440 --> 00:40:20,960
that's ever existed in this country.

1081
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:24,200
In rural Russia, every small town has a cow circus.

1082
00:40:24,200 --> 00:40:25,300
Josie Long.

1083
00:40:25,300 --> 00:40:26,540
You should have a beef.

1084
00:40:26,540 --> 00:40:27,880
Have a beef with them.

1085
00:40:27,880 --> 00:40:28,880
I have a beef with you.

1086
00:40:28,880 --> 00:40:30,480
I will have a beef with you.

1087
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:33,400
Come round my house and I'll have a beef with you.

1088
00:40:33,400 --> 00:40:34,440
And Andy Daly.

1089
00:40:34,440 --> 00:40:35,880
That virus never existed.

1090
00:40:35,880 --> 00:40:38,480
There was never any such thing as a mad cow disease.

1091
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:43,080
That was all an illusion that Big Lamb came up with.

1092
00:40:43,080 --> 00:40:45,040
That's the Beef and Dairy Network podcast.

1093
00:40:45,040 --> 00:40:47,200
Find us at MaximumFun.org

1094
00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:49,480
or wherever you get your podcasts from.

1095
00:40:49,480 --> 00:40:52,540
And I would recommend starting at episode one.

1096
00:40:52,540 --> 00:40:53,380
Bye.

1097
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:57,020
Do you guys wanna Yahoo?

1098
00:40:57,020 --> 00:40:58,480
Yeah. Yeah.

1099
00:40:58,480 --> 00:41:01,560
This is kind of a new segment idea that I have

1100
00:41:01,560 --> 00:41:02,840
and I'm gonna bounce it off y'all

1101
00:41:02,840 --> 00:41:04,840
and if it goes over like a real lead balloon,

1102
00:41:04,840 --> 00:41:06,880
then I'll put it right back in the toilet.

1103
00:41:07,960 --> 00:41:09,520
It's sent in by Graham Roebuck.

1104
00:41:09,520 --> 00:41:10,400
Thank you, Graham.

1105
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:11,920
So I'm an anonymous Yahoo Answers user,

1106
00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:13,120
but I'm gonna call him.

1107
00:41:13,120 --> 00:41:18,120
Let's just, Sturm asks,

1108
00:41:19,960 --> 00:41:23,620
will the Marine Corps check my tattoo in detail?

1109
00:41:25,040 --> 00:41:27,680
Long story short, I have this tattoo that I don't like.

1110
00:41:27,680 --> 00:41:30,320
It's not going to be offensive by military standards,

1111
00:41:30,320 --> 00:41:34,920
but it is, how should I say this, a little embarrassing.

1112
00:41:34,920 --> 00:41:37,080
I once went to the place to get a tat on my back.

1113
00:41:37,080 --> 00:41:39,160
I picked out a real beauty, an American Eagle,

1114
00:41:39,160 --> 00:41:40,420
really awesome.

1115
00:41:40,420 --> 00:41:43,880
Anyhow, I get it done and I see it in the mirror afterwards.

1116
00:41:43,880 --> 00:41:45,000
I noticed there's some words

1117
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:46,440
in the circle surrounding the Eagle.

1118
00:41:46,440 --> 00:41:49,440
The words are small and I can't make it out

1119
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:51,680
because the mirror makes everything look reversed.

1120
00:41:51,680 --> 00:41:54,680
The artist guy says it reads All American Spirit.

1121
00:41:54,680 --> 00:41:55,560
Okay, cool.

1122
00:41:55,560 --> 00:41:58,340
I didn't ask for lettering, but it's a nice bonus.

1123
00:41:58,340 --> 00:42:00,240
Three weeks later, I'm playing basketball

1124
00:42:00,240 --> 00:42:01,480
with a bunch of guys.

1125
00:42:01,480 --> 00:42:03,560
It's four on four at the park court.

1126
00:42:03,560 --> 00:42:05,480
We do shirts and skins.

1127
00:42:05,480 --> 00:42:06,600
I am a skin.

1128
00:42:06,600 --> 00:42:08,200
So this guy reads my tattoos.

1129
00:42:08,200 --> 00:42:09,480
We're taking a break.

1130
00:42:09,480 --> 00:42:11,560
He really busts out laughing.

1131
00:42:11,560 --> 00:42:14,020
Can't figure out why he's laughing at an Eagle.

1132
00:42:14,020 --> 00:42:15,920
My friend comes over and starts laughing too.

1133
00:42:15,920 --> 00:42:17,380
I say, what is so funny?

1134
00:42:17,380 --> 00:42:19,600
They tell me what the tattoo says.

1135
00:42:19,600 --> 00:42:22,740
Turns out it doesn't say All American Spirit.

1136
00:42:22,740 --> 00:42:25,200
It actually says, I love to masturbate.

1137
00:42:25,200 --> 00:42:26,440
Can you believe it?

1138
00:42:28,600 --> 00:42:30,160
Update, so I go home.

1139
00:42:30,160 --> 00:42:32,760
I still can't believe my uncle is there.

1140
00:42:32,760 --> 00:42:33,880
So I asked him to read it.

1141
00:42:33,880 --> 00:42:36,280
He confirms that it says, I love to masturbate.

1142
00:42:36,280 --> 00:42:37,960
I still think it is some type of joke.

1143
00:42:37,960 --> 00:42:41,440
So I ask my sister, she says the same thing.

1144
00:42:41,440 --> 00:42:44,620
Update two, I look in the mirror with a big magnifier.

1145
00:42:47,660 --> 00:42:49,580
Sure enough, they are right.

1146
00:42:49,580 --> 00:42:51,720
The guy, sure enough, they are right.

1147
00:42:51,720 --> 00:42:54,640
The guy really printed those words on my back.

1148
00:42:54,640 --> 00:42:58,240
Update three, later my uncle says, wait a minute.

1149
00:42:58,240 --> 00:43:00,440
Did you go to Ed's to have that done?

1150
00:43:00,440 --> 00:43:01,880
It's not.

1151
00:43:01,880 --> 00:43:04,360
Wait a minute, did you go to Ed's to have that done?

1152
00:43:04,360 --> 00:43:06,700
I say, yeah, so what?

1153
00:43:06,700 --> 00:43:08,280
My uncle tells me about the run

1154
00:43:08,280 --> 00:43:10,400
and he had with Ed a few months ago.

1155
00:43:10,400 --> 00:43:12,360
Ed told my uncle that he would get him back

1156
00:43:12,360 --> 00:43:14,380
one way or another.

1157
00:43:14,380 --> 00:43:16,860
Update four, Ed said, I don't know how,

1158
00:43:16,860 --> 00:43:21,200
but I will get you or your nephew or one of your relatives.

1159
00:43:21,200 --> 00:43:23,840
My uncle confirms that Ed fucked me over

1160
00:43:23,840 --> 00:43:26,280
because of my uncle's dispute.

1161
00:43:26,280 --> 00:43:27,880
Update five, so my uncle and me

1162
00:43:27,880 --> 00:43:29,480
go down to Ed's tattoo parlor.

1163
00:43:29,480 --> 00:43:31,660
There is a sign on the door that reads,

1164
00:43:31,660 --> 00:43:34,560
permanently closed, filed for bankruptcy.

1165
00:43:34,560 --> 00:43:36,960
We later learned that Ed had a criminal warrant

1166
00:43:36,960 --> 00:43:38,440
and fled to Mexico.

1167
00:43:38,440 --> 00:43:39,760
Update six, so my question,

1168
00:43:39,760 --> 00:43:42,000
will the Marines let me in with such a tattoo?

1169
00:43:44,600 --> 00:43:46,800
So I figured this could be like a new fun like fiction

1170
00:43:46,800 --> 00:43:50,280
corner just to see like the sort of fun slice of life

1171
00:43:50,280 --> 00:43:54,100
Gene ass shepherd stories that the Yahoo answer service

1172
00:43:54,100 --> 00:43:55,300
can produce for us.

1173
00:43:55,300 --> 00:43:58,040
Because this one is so rich,

1174
00:43:58,040 --> 00:43:59,640
put it right in the reader's digest.

1175
00:43:59,640 --> 00:44:01,160
I don't know if you can say masturbate

1176
00:44:01,160 --> 00:44:03,280
in the reader's digest.

1177
00:44:03,280 --> 00:44:05,160
So maybe we'll have to like switch that word out

1178
00:44:05,160 --> 00:44:07,320
and I think they say fuck in here somewhere.

1179
00:44:07,320 --> 00:44:10,080
But I read this and obviously it's not true,

1180
00:44:10,080 --> 00:44:12,520
but gosh, it was such a gut buster.

1181
00:44:12,520 --> 00:44:14,840
Yeah, and what a journey.

1182
00:44:14,840 --> 00:44:17,140
And it takes you on a journey.

1183
00:44:17,140 --> 00:44:20,240
I did not see it coming that Ed would be a criminal

1184
00:44:20,240 --> 00:44:21,520
who fled to Mexico,

1185
00:44:21,520 --> 00:44:24,040
but I really feel like that was a necessary component

1186
00:44:24,040 --> 00:44:26,080
that really tied everything together.

1187
00:44:26,080 --> 00:44:28,720
I think it's amazing that both fled to Mexico

1188
00:44:28,720 --> 00:44:30,840
and filed for bankruptcy.

1189
00:44:30,840 --> 00:44:32,700
Yeah, I didn't even need both.

1190
00:44:32,700 --> 00:44:33,660
If you think about it,

1191
00:44:33,660 --> 00:44:35,360
that could have been the end of the story either way,

1192
00:44:35,360 --> 00:44:37,760
but I think that that's a detail that really...

1193
00:44:40,760 --> 00:44:43,240
I don't think that's how updates work.

1194
00:44:43,240 --> 00:44:44,080
No. That's one thing

1195
00:44:44,080 --> 00:44:47,660
I will definitely say that that's not how,

1196
00:44:47,660 --> 00:44:50,260
it's not chapter headings.

1197
00:44:50,260 --> 00:44:51,100
Right.

1198
00:44:52,600 --> 00:44:55,320
No, this is an outline for a book

1199
00:44:55,320 --> 00:44:56,760
that this person's writing.

1200
00:44:56,760 --> 00:44:57,600
Okay.

1201
00:44:57,600 --> 00:44:58,420
Yeah.

1202
00:44:58,420 --> 00:44:59,600
Are there people responding to it

1203
00:44:59,600 --> 00:45:02,440
who are kind of saying like that's lying?

1204
00:45:02,440 --> 00:45:03,480
Yeah, Mercury says,

1205
00:45:03,480 --> 00:45:05,360
it sounds like a made up story.

1206
00:45:05,360 --> 00:45:06,440
Does it?

1207
00:45:06,440 --> 00:45:10,000
Gunji says, nice story, now prove it.

1208
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:11,260
You don't want them to prove it

1209
00:45:11,260 --> 00:45:12,720
because that means they have to go get a tattoo

1210
00:45:12,720 --> 00:45:15,400
that says I love to masturbate.

1211
00:45:15,400 --> 00:45:17,040
Oh no, they challenge me.

1212
00:45:17,040 --> 00:45:19,920
Well, I guess I made my bed.

1213
00:45:19,920 --> 00:45:21,000
And then Edwina says,

1214
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:22,600
and you believe your basketball buddies?

1215
00:45:22,600 --> 00:45:24,880
Find somebody to look at your back and tell you what it says.

1216
00:45:24,880 --> 00:45:27,040
Eventually you'll hear repeating answers.

1217
00:45:28,400 --> 00:45:30,200
That's where update two came in.

1218
00:45:30,200 --> 00:45:32,360
Yeah, common sense says current guidelines

1219
00:45:32,360 --> 00:45:33,200
are more liberal.

1220
00:45:33,200 --> 00:45:34,640
You should be fine if it's not in your hands,

1221
00:45:34,640 --> 00:45:35,480
face or forearms.

1222
00:45:35,480 --> 00:45:39,000
I think they'll be fine, nothing to worry about.

1223
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:42,320
Marines are like, yeah, we actually like that too a lot.

1224
00:45:42,320 --> 00:45:45,080
It's a good tattoo because it's not your face or forearms.

1225
00:45:45,080 --> 00:45:46,020
No one got to see that.

1226
00:45:46,020 --> 00:45:47,700
You got a backpack on.

1227
00:45:47,700 --> 00:45:49,260
I'm getting married in a little over a month

1228
00:45:49,260 --> 00:45:51,420
and I recently made the grave mistake

1229
00:45:51,420 --> 00:45:53,760
of mentioning to my soon to be father-in-law

1230
00:45:53,760 --> 00:45:56,480
that I was kind of a magic nerd when I was a kid

1231
00:45:56,480 --> 00:45:58,400
and that I often said I wanted to be a magician

1232
00:45:58,400 --> 00:45:59,240
when I grew up.

1233
00:45:59,240 --> 00:46:00,800
He said that I should put on a magic show

1234
00:46:00,800 --> 00:46:02,500
for his birthday in a couple of months.

1235
00:46:02,500 --> 00:46:05,120
Oh no. Oh yes, yes.

1236
00:46:05,120 --> 00:46:06,920
Thinking that he was obviously joking,

1237
00:46:06,920 --> 00:46:08,320
I said, yeah, sure.

1238
00:46:08,320 --> 00:46:10,080
Brothers, he was not joking.

1239
00:46:10,080 --> 00:46:12,880
He kept bringing up how excited he is for this magic show.

1240
00:46:12,880 --> 00:46:16,320
Out of pure social awkwardness, I kept going along with it.

1241
00:46:16,320 --> 00:46:19,760
It's important to note, I have no idea how to do magic.

1242
00:46:19,760 --> 00:46:21,640
What do I do?

1243
00:46:21,640 --> 00:46:23,840
That's from whatever the opposite of a prestige is

1244
00:46:23,840 --> 00:46:24,660
in Pittsburgh.

1245
00:46:24,660 --> 00:46:25,680
I want to get a mason jar

1246
00:46:25,680 --> 00:46:28,000
and collect the air I'm breathing right now

1247
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:29,840
so I can, I just want to remember everything

1248
00:46:29,840 --> 00:46:32,560
about this moment because it's so good to me.

1249
00:46:32,560 --> 00:46:34,800
Oh, you fucked up so bad.

1250
00:46:34,800 --> 00:46:35,640
Oh my goodness.

1251
00:46:35,640 --> 00:46:36,520
Unbelievably bad.

1252
00:46:36,520 --> 00:46:37,520
Unbelievably bad.

1253
00:46:37,520 --> 00:46:41,740
You can't let in-laws know about any interest you have

1254
00:46:41,740 --> 00:46:44,080
because that will become, in their mind,

1255
00:46:44,080 --> 00:46:46,880
the only interest you have.

1256
00:46:46,880 --> 00:46:48,680
You know what I mean? You at the very least,

1257
00:46:48,680 --> 00:46:52,120
like the best case scenario is you are setting yourself up

1258
00:46:52,120 --> 00:46:55,400
to receive magic kits every Christmas

1259
00:46:55,400 --> 00:46:57,320
for the rest of your natural life.

1260
00:46:57,320 --> 00:47:02,000
Now that I say that out loud, that sounds pretty good.

1261
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:02,840
Extremely good.

1262
00:47:02,840 --> 00:47:04,240
It actually doesn't sound that bad.

1263
00:47:04,240 --> 00:47:07,240
I would lock myself in a box as part of the trick

1264
00:47:07,240 --> 00:47:09,800
and then inside there, I've got an itty bitty book light

1265
00:47:09,800 --> 00:47:12,040
and a novel and I just stay in there

1266
00:47:12,040 --> 00:47:13,720
until everyone goes away.

1267
00:47:13,720 --> 00:47:15,080
I catch up on your Bible.

1268
00:47:16,620 --> 00:47:18,500
Where it says you're not allowed to do magic.

1269
00:47:18,500 --> 00:47:19,500
What if that was your thing?

1270
00:47:19,500 --> 00:47:21,160
It's like, I used to be way into magic,

1271
00:47:21,160 --> 00:47:25,000
but now I'm just super fundamentalist only.

1272
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:26,400
Sorry, dad.

1273
00:47:26,400 --> 00:47:28,120
Yes. Suffer not a witch.

1274
00:47:28,120 --> 00:47:29,320
Sorry, my dude.

1275
00:47:30,520 --> 00:47:31,360
It's in the book.

1276
00:47:31,360 --> 00:47:32,660
The good one, I say.

1277
00:47:38,480 --> 00:47:41,080
You have fucked up so incredibly badly

1278
00:47:41,080 --> 00:47:43,140
that I don't think that we can help.

1279
00:47:43,140 --> 00:47:44,720
What if you just did it?

1280
00:47:44,720 --> 00:47:47,860
Yeah, just do it and rock their fucking socks off.

1281
00:47:47,860 --> 00:47:50,840
What if you cut the dad in half, really?

1282
00:47:50,840 --> 00:47:53,280
That's so bad.

1283
00:47:53,280 --> 00:47:55,880
Can you even imagine how bad that would be?

1284
00:47:55,880 --> 00:47:57,280
No, don't murder.

1285
00:47:57,280 --> 00:47:59,040
It would be for magic.

1286
00:47:59,040 --> 00:48:00,720
It would be for magic.

1287
00:48:00,720 --> 00:48:02,200
How many times do you think people have tried

1288
00:48:02,200 --> 00:48:04,160
that defense in court of like,

1289
00:48:04,160 --> 00:48:05,840
you cut this person in half, like, yeah,

1290
00:48:05,840 --> 00:48:08,140
but I was trying to do a trick and it went really badly.

1291
00:48:08,140 --> 00:48:10,320
Like, it's not my fault.

1292
00:48:10,320 --> 00:48:12,400
It's not my fault that I'm bad at magic.

1293
00:48:12,400 --> 00:48:13,320
They moved.

1294
00:48:17,120 --> 00:48:19,440
I wanna let you guys know that I just found the website

1295
00:48:19,440 --> 00:48:22,480
for F-C-M.org.

1296
00:48:22,480 --> 00:48:26,760
That's F-C-M.org, the Fellowship of Christian Magicians.

1297
00:48:26,760 --> 00:48:28,320
So they're gonna call you on it.

1298
00:48:28,320 --> 00:48:30,260
If they go poking around at all,

1299
00:48:30,260 --> 00:48:32,800
they are almost certainly going to, as I found,

1300
00:48:32,800 --> 00:48:35,640
the very first result being

1301
00:48:35,640 --> 00:48:37,720
the Fellowship of Christian Magicians.

1302
00:48:37,720 --> 00:48:41,260
Their 2019 convention is coming up pretty soon,

1303
00:48:41,260 --> 00:48:42,640
so make sure you do check that out.

1304
00:48:42,640 --> 00:48:43,660
Well, next year, right?

1305
00:48:43,660 --> 00:48:44,920
They're not doing it this year, are they?

1306
00:48:44,920 --> 00:48:47,120
Because that would be a pretty cool trick.

1307
00:48:47,120 --> 00:48:48,880
Guys, I just wanna tell you all,

1308
00:48:48,880 --> 00:48:49,960
I'm not gonna read it all,

1309
00:48:49,960 --> 00:48:51,880
because I'm sure it's actually pretty fascinating.

1310
00:48:51,880 --> 00:48:55,080
There is at least 1500 words creed

1311
00:48:55,080 --> 00:48:57,300
about whether or not it's okay to do magic.

1312
00:48:57,300 --> 00:49:00,080
So make sure you do check that out.

1313
00:49:00,080 --> 00:49:02,160
Oh, God, I just got itchy, Justin.

1314
00:49:02,160 --> 00:49:03,440
I got itchy with the urge.

1315
00:49:03,440 --> 00:49:05,240
I need to read this, please.

1316
00:49:05,240 --> 00:49:06,080
I know, I know.

1317
00:49:06,080 --> 00:49:07,880
Can we take a break from the show, or what's up?

1318
00:49:07,880 --> 00:49:09,280
While you read it, Griffin,

1319
00:49:09,280 --> 00:49:11,040
I've got a solution to this problem,

1320
00:49:11,040 --> 00:49:11,960
how you get out of it.

1321
00:49:11,960 --> 00:49:14,640
You're also going to drop on your future father-in-law

1322
00:49:14,640 --> 00:49:15,840
that when you were a kid,

1323
00:49:15,840 --> 00:49:19,280
you also were really into prosthetic makeup.

1324
00:49:19,280 --> 00:49:21,200
Like, you guys love stage makeup.

1325
00:49:21,200 --> 00:49:23,960
And then you're gonna hire a member

1326
00:49:23,960 --> 00:49:25,600
of the Fellowship of Christian Magicians

1327
00:49:25,600 --> 00:49:29,400
that you kind of look like, and show up,

1328
00:49:29,400 --> 00:49:30,800
and they're gonna do the show,

1329
00:49:30,800 --> 00:49:33,040
and then you're gonna pull off your prosthetic makeup.

1330
00:49:33,040 --> 00:49:34,280
Once the show's done, you do the bit,

1331
00:49:34,280 --> 00:49:35,480
you know, oh, it's you.

1332
00:49:35,480 --> 00:49:36,520
And then you're like, that was me.

1333
00:49:36,520 --> 00:49:38,200
I did the show, and I did it so good,

1334
00:49:38,200 --> 00:49:39,280
I could never do it again.

1335
00:49:39,280 --> 00:49:40,500
Please don't ever ask.

1336
00:49:41,580 --> 00:49:42,520
The end. Sorry, Trevor.

1337
00:49:42,520 --> 00:49:44,880
I was not listening, and you had to know that.

1338
00:49:44,880 --> 00:49:47,560
I was reading this Constitution, my friend.

1339
00:49:47,560 --> 00:49:50,540
Because it's genuinely interesting.

1340
00:49:50,540 --> 00:49:53,340
What Travis said, I'm sure, was the right answer.

1341
00:49:54,760 --> 00:49:56,800
That is almost certainly helpful.

1342
00:49:56,800 --> 00:49:57,720
Probably.

1343
00:49:59,080 --> 00:50:02,120
How many tricks does a magic show make?

1344
00:50:02,120 --> 00:50:05,040
I mean, if you have one really good one,

1345
00:50:05,040 --> 00:50:06,560
I think you're safe.

1346
00:50:06,560 --> 00:50:09,120
No, sorry, no.

1347
00:50:09,120 --> 00:50:11,520
If you do one magic trick,

1348
00:50:11,520 --> 00:50:14,400
that is a trick that could happen impromptu.

1349
00:50:14,400 --> 00:50:17,960
If someone asks you to prepare a show,

1350
00:50:17,960 --> 00:50:20,200
I think you need a tight five.

1351
00:50:20,200 --> 00:50:21,480
I think you need a tight five

1352
00:50:21,480 --> 00:50:23,960
to be able to call it a show with a straight face.

1353
00:50:23,960 --> 00:50:25,360
It's gotta be a good five.

1354
00:50:26,580 --> 00:50:28,440
What is a magic show, though?

1355
00:50:32,440 --> 00:50:34,000
Because everybody has different ideas of it.

1356
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:36,760
Some people do cards, some people do the rings thing,

1357
00:50:36,760 --> 00:50:38,200
and some people just hold their breath

1358
00:50:38,200 --> 00:50:40,600
on Oprah for 20 minutes.

1359
00:50:40,600 --> 00:50:45,160
And so you could do maybe that.

1360
00:50:45,160 --> 00:50:47,120
You could say, okay, here's the trick,

1361
00:50:47,120 --> 00:50:48,400
and you turn on the TV,

1362
00:50:48,400 --> 00:50:51,080
and then Oprah is back,

1363
00:50:51,080 --> 00:50:53,040
which is a trick in and of itself.

1364
00:50:53,040 --> 00:50:55,080
And then you walk onto, and she's like,

1365
00:50:56,120 --> 00:50:58,340
this show's all about people holding their breath

1366
00:50:58,340 --> 00:50:59,860
a very long time now.

1367
00:51:01,480 --> 00:51:03,640
So you go in the big tank, and you try to do it,

1368
00:51:03,640 --> 00:51:05,000
but you're not, here's the thing,

1369
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:05,920
you don't have to do it,

1370
00:51:05,920 --> 00:51:07,060
because you can be like, oh no,

1371
00:51:07,060 --> 00:51:10,720
I ate a big hoagie right before I came here, Oprah,

1372
00:51:10,720 --> 00:51:12,400
so I got the cramps, can't do it.

1373
00:51:12,400 --> 00:51:14,400
But I tried, Dad, I love you.

1374
00:51:14,400 --> 00:51:16,200
Maybe you let someone punch you in the stomach,

1375
00:51:16,200 --> 00:51:18,640
like Houdini, it's pretty good.

1376
00:51:18,640 --> 00:51:20,600
I can withstand it, not die like him,

1377
00:51:20,600 --> 00:51:22,580
so now I'm the better magician.

1378
00:51:22,580 --> 00:51:23,960
Yeah, right?

1379
00:51:23,960 --> 00:51:26,580
Or maybe, oh, just eat that big Subway sandwich

1380
00:51:26,580 --> 00:51:27,680
right in front of him.

1381
00:51:27,680 --> 00:51:28,520
Mm-hmm.

1382
00:51:28,520 --> 00:51:30,120
Da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da.

1383
00:51:30,120 --> 00:51:32,000
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah.

1384
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:33,140
What do you think, Dad?

1385
00:51:33,140 --> 00:51:34,760
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah.

1386
00:51:34,760 --> 00:51:36,240
I'm gonna do the whole thing, Daddy, I love you.

1387
00:51:36,240 --> 00:51:37,760
Can I call you Daddy, by the way?

1388
00:51:37,760 --> 00:51:41,640
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah.

1389
00:51:41,640 --> 00:51:46,640
Maybe you do a special show with the lights off.

1390
00:51:47,680 --> 00:51:51,040
Oh, erotic magic, ero magic.

1391
00:51:51,040 --> 00:51:54,680
I do erotic magic, and it's sensory magic, okay?

1392
00:51:54,680 --> 00:51:59,320
So it's not gonna be able to be seen with the naked eye,

1393
00:51:59,320 --> 00:52:00,760
so all the lights will be off,

1394
00:52:00,760 --> 00:52:04,520
and the magic will happen all around you.

1395
00:52:04,520 --> 00:52:07,800
You don't need to see magic, you can smell magic,

1396
00:52:07,800 --> 00:52:09,040
you can taste magic.

1397
00:52:09,040 --> 00:52:10,040
Oh my God.

1398
00:52:10,040 --> 00:52:11,160
And as you're saying all this stuff,

1399
00:52:11,160 --> 00:52:13,560
you're slowly making your way towards the door,

1400
00:52:13,560 --> 00:52:17,560
and by the time, and then you put a chair

1401
00:52:17,560 --> 00:52:19,680
underneath the door on the outside.

1402
00:52:19,680 --> 00:52:23,440
Yeah, you cask of a Montalato to your dad, your new dad.

1403
00:52:23,440 --> 00:52:27,560
And, and, let me say this, all of his friends.

1404
00:52:27,560 --> 00:52:31,400
You just, and they'll, your dad is probably gonna eat

1405
00:52:31,400 --> 00:52:34,760
his friends at some point, unless they eat him first.

1406
00:52:34,760 --> 00:52:39,600
And that's, and then, and then, and then, after two weeks,

1407
00:52:39,600 --> 00:52:43,040
you go and you remove the door, and you open it,

1408
00:52:43,040 --> 00:52:47,800
and their skeletons fall out, and you say, ta-da.

1409
00:52:47,800 --> 00:52:51,720
So you think after two weeks, your future father-in-law

1410
00:52:51,720 --> 00:52:54,000
will not only have resorted to cannibalism,

1411
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:59,000
but he has everyone else in the room clean to the bone.

1412
00:53:00,800 --> 00:53:05,800
And your future partner's gonna be like, what the heck?

1413
00:53:06,280 --> 00:53:08,040
And you'll be like, no, it's like that fucking,

1414
00:53:08,040 --> 00:53:10,360
it's like the social magic.

1415
00:53:10,360 --> 00:53:11,720
You know what I mean?

1416
00:53:11,720 --> 00:53:15,480
Because your dad was clearly only a hair's breadth away

1417
00:53:15,480 --> 00:53:17,240
from cannibalism.

1418
00:53:17,240 --> 00:53:18,320
You don't understand.

1419
00:53:18,320 --> 00:53:20,640
I'm on that Darren Brown shit, it's social magic.

1420
00:53:20,640 --> 00:53:22,520
I made your dad eat all his friends.

1421
00:53:22,520 --> 00:53:25,800
With the power of suggestion, with the power of suggestion

1422
00:53:25,800 --> 00:53:27,560
and hunger, I made your dad turn all his friend

1423
00:53:27,560 --> 00:53:29,660
into skeletons, I'm like Darren Brown.

1424
00:53:29,660 --> 00:53:32,720
There was another door he could've walked out at any time,

1425
00:53:32,720 --> 00:53:34,480
and yet he didn't, why?

1426
00:53:34,480 --> 00:53:35,840
The window's open.

1427
00:53:35,840 --> 00:53:37,980
He wanted to eat his friends, the window's open,

1428
00:53:37,980 --> 00:53:39,640
they could see everything.

1429
00:53:39,640 --> 00:53:41,200
Hello, I'm Darren Brown.

1430
00:53:41,200 --> 00:53:43,120
Today, on my new Netflix special,

1431
00:53:43,120 --> 00:53:45,160
I have a theory about people I'd like to prove.

1432
00:53:45,160 --> 00:53:47,960
We all wanna eat all our friends and turn them into bones.

1433
00:53:49,240 --> 00:53:51,520
To accomplish this, I'm going to lock my father-in-law

1434
00:53:51,520 --> 00:53:54,000
in a closet for three minutes.

1435
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:58,360
Oh my God, like a pack of piranhas, he has boned his friend.

1436
00:53:58,360 --> 00:54:00,520
Oops, little magician joke.

1437
00:54:00,520 --> 00:54:01,440
I'm Darren Brown.

1438
00:54:01,440 --> 00:54:03,760
Hey, push that guy off that cliff.

1439
00:54:03,760 --> 00:54:04,740
I can do anything.

1440
00:54:04,740 --> 00:54:08,380
No jury in the world.

1441
00:54:08,380 --> 00:54:11,140
This is my wife, Plumaria, I love her very much,

1442
00:54:11,140 --> 00:54:14,180
and she loves her dad, and you're gonna love her dad

1443
00:54:15,140 --> 00:54:18,220
as you watch him eat all his good friends.

1444
00:54:18,220 --> 00:54:19,420
Why am I doing this?

1445
00:54:19,420 --> 00:54:20,380
I don't know.

1446
00:54:20,380 --> 00:54:21,940
Someone please help me.

1447
00:54:21,940 --> 00:54:24,460
I'm just topping myself over and over again.

1448
00:54:24,460 --> 00:54:26,220
I don't know why I pretended to be a magician

1449
00:54:26,220 --> 00:54:28,140
to my dad in turn.

1450
00:54:28,140 --> 00:54:30,380
That's right, this is all for his benefit.

1451
00:54:30,380 --> 00:54:31,900
Let's wrap it right up.

1452
00:54:31,900 --> 00:54:34,740
Folks, thank you so much for joining us.

1453
00:54:35,940 --> 00:54:37,400
Kind of a weird one.

1454
00:54:37,400 --> 00:54:41,020
Poor Travis has been home for about 24 hours,

1455
00:54:41,020 --> 00:54:43,280
and then he's gonna get back on a plane

1456
00:54:43,280 --> 00:54:46,140
and go over to London.

1457
00:54:46,140 --> 00:54:49,460
So expect a lot of really good accents coming up.

1458
00:54:49,460 --> 00:54:50,780
Oh, yeah.

1459
00:54:50,780 --> 00:54:51,980
Before too long.

1460
00:54:51,980 --> 00:54:55,180
All right, so everybody, real quick, some plugs.

1461
00:54:55,180 --> 00:54:57,880
We just launched a bunch of new stuff on macroemerch.com,

1462
00:54:57,880 --> 00:55:02,380
including a Schmaners t-shirt and a Schmaners pin set,

1463
00:55:02,380 --> 00:55:05,740
but, and I say this as one half of Schmaners,

1464
00:55:05,740 --> 00:55:08,220
even more importantly, we launched

1465
00:55:08,220 --> 00:55:11,140
our generic podcast merch line,

1466
00:55:11,140 --> 00:55:14,700
which is like the silliest and my new favorite thing.

1467
00:55:14,700 --> 00:55:17,620
We've had the idea for a long time,

1468
00:55:17,620 --> 00:55:19,140
and it's finally happening.

1469
00:55:20,420 --> 00:55:23,800
And you can get a mug that says don't talk to me

1470
00:55:23,800 --> 00:55:26,040
before I've had my podcast.

1471
00:55:26,040 --> 00:55:29,560
You can get a poster that says a journey of a thousand miles

1472
00:55:29,560 --> 00:55:31,340
begins with a single podcast,

1473
00:55:31,340 --> 00:55:35,020
and you probably should get all these things.

1474
00:55:35,020 --> 00:55:39,060
There's a beer koozie that says podcaster on it.

1475
00:55:39,060 --> 00:55:41,140
With like three frogs saying it.

1476
00:55:41,140 --> 00:55:41,980
It's pretty great.

1477
00:55:43,660 --> 00:55:47,820
And our proceeds for that are going to an organization

1478
00:55:47,820 --> 00:55:49,180
in our hometown of Huntington, West Virginia,

1479
00:55:49,180 --> 00:55:52,740
who is working to help combat opiate addiction.

1480
00:55:52,740 --> 00:55:56,780
So it's for a good cause and it's fun and dumb.

1481
00:55:56,780 --> 00:55:58,900
So you can go to macroemerch.com.

1482
00:55:58,900 --> 00:56:01,260
I'm doing another CUS show here in Cincinnati,

1483
00:56:01,260 --> 00:56:05,420
bit.ly, CUS September 2018.

1484
00:56:05,420 --> 00:56:08,380
That's September 23rd, get your tickets now.

1485
00:56:08,380 --> 00:56:10,740
I'm also doing a show at New York Comic Con

1486
00:56:10,740 --> 00:56:14,260
with Janet Varney and Jean Grey and Miles Luna

1487
00:56:14,260 --> 00:56:17,980
and Samus the Rapper and Patrick Rothfuss

1488
00:56:17,980 --> 00:56:21,660
and the Double Clicks, Pauline Storm, Jonathan Colton.

1489
00:56:21,660 --> 00:56:23,800
It's an amazing lineup.

1490
00:56:23,800 --> 00:56:25,540
And Schmaners is going to be there as well.

1491
00:56:25,540 --> 00:56:29,700
You can get tickets for that at bit.ly slash McElroy NYC.

1492
00:56:29,700 --> 00:56:32,100
There's also a- NYCC.

1493
00:56:32,100 --> 00:56:34,700
Thank you, McElroy NYCC.

1494
00:56:34,700 --> 00:56:36,900
There's also a Taz panel at New York Comic Con,

1495
00:56:36,900 --> 00:56:39,900
in which we will be previewing book two

1496
00:56:39,900 --> 00:56:41,620
of the Taz graphic novel.

1497
00:56:41,620 --> 00:56:46,140
You can get tickets for that at bit.ly slash Taz NYCC.

1498
00:56:46,140 --> 00:56:48,380
Also go get the Sawbones book.

1499
00:56:48,380 --> 00:56:49,200
It's a great book.

1500
00:56:49,200 --> 00:56:51,220
We got hooked up with some early copies of it

1501
00:56:51,220 --> 00:56:54,500
and I was enjoying it very much on the flight home.

1502
00:56:54,500 --> 00:56:56,060
And there's some juice,

1503
00:56:56,060 --> 00:56:57,980
there's some gnar shit in there, bud.

1504
00:56:57,980 --> 00:56:59,160
Oh, thanks, bud.

1505
00:56:59,160 --> 00:57:00,220
I'm glad you like it.

1506
00:57:00,220 --> 00:57:01,060
It's pretty gnarly.

1507
00:57:01,060 --> 00:57:01,900
We had to write all of it.

1508
00:57:01,900 --> 00:57:02,720
It's pretty gnar.

1509
00:57:02,720 --> 00:57:05,020
There's a huge picture of a dick on page two.

1510
00:57:05,020 --> 00:57:06,140
It's so awesome.

1511
00:57:06,140 --> 00:57:08,140
Yeah, cool to flip that open on an airplane,

1512
00:57:08,140 --> 00:57:10,340
but where can people pre-order the Sawbones book?

1513
00:57:10,340 --> 00:57:12,980
Bit.ly slash the Sawbones book.

1514
00:57:12,980 --> 00:57:15,460
And Travis has a new show out called Positivitini

1515
00:57:15,460 --> 00:57:17,220
that comes out several times a week.

1516
00:57:17,220 --> 00:57:18,900
Yes, Monday, Wednesday, Friday.

1517
00:57:18,900 --> 00:57:21,540
It's messages of hope, joy, and inspiration

1518
00:57:21,540 --> 00:57:24,300
in 10 minutes or less with me and my friends,

1519
00:57:24,300 --> 00:57:26,660
Amy Dallin and Erica Ishii.

1520
00:57:26,660 --> 00:57:28,540
It's just a little positive thing

1521
00:57:28,540 --> 00:57:31,200
and you can find it on all your different podcatchers.

1522
00:57:31,200 --> 00:57:32,600
Positivitini.

1523
00:57:33,600 --> 00:57:35,220
Thanks to John Roderick and the Long Winters

1524
00:57:35,220 --> 00:57:36,060
for these four theme song.

1525
00:57:36,060 --> 00:57:38,140
It's a departure off the album, Putting the Days to Bed.

1526
00:57:38,140 --> 00:57:40,100
It's a very good album that you should just have.

1527
00:57:40,100 --> 00:57:41,960

It's a Yahoo Answers user who has chosen to remain anonymous.

1539
00:58:02,980 --> 00:58:05,820
So I'm gonna call them Beverly asks,

1540
00:58:07,340 --> 00:58:09,740
my dog doesn't wanna go on walks with me anymore

1541
00:58:09,740 --> 00:58:10,980
because of the owls.

1542
00:58:10,980 --> 00:58:12,420
Does the dog know?

1543
00:58:14,140 --> 00:58:15,600
Hi.

1544
00:58:15,600 --> 00:58:17,120
My name is Justin McElroy.

1545
00:58:17,120 --> 00:58:18,460
I'm Travis McElroy.

1546
00:58:18,460 --> 00:58:19,380
I'm Griffin McElroy.

1547
00:58:19,380 --> 00:58:20,500
It's been my brother, my brother and me.

1548
00:58:20,500 --> 00:58:21,340
Kiss your dad.

1549
00:58:21,340 --> 00:58:22,500
Square on the lips.

1550
00:58:25,540 --> 00:58:30,540
Hey, good girls, do you wanna just say hey, I wanna?

1551
00:58:39,540 --> 00:58:41,460

1555
00:58:44,880 --> 00:58:46,860
Hello, listeners of MaximumFun.

1556
00:58:46,860 --> 00:58:48,860
I wanna tell you about our newest podcast

1557
00:58:48,860 --> 00:58:51,540
that tells you all about the truth of the flat earth.

1558
00:58:51,540 --> 00:58:53,300
Have you been looking out over the horizon

1559
00:58:53,300 --> 00:58:54,740
and you've been thinking, wait a minute,

1560
00:58:54,740 --> 00:58:56,340
this doesn't look round.

1561
00:58:56,340 --> 00:58:58,380
I've been lied to my whole life.

1562
00:58:58,380 --> 00:59:02,740
What is NASA doing with $52 million a day?

1563
00:59:02,740 --> 00:59:04,420
Uh, uh, come on.

1564
00:59:04,420 --> 00:59:06,420
We explode the myths.

1565
00:59:06,420 --> 00:59:07,860
Just kidding.

1566
00:59:07,860 --> 00:59:09,320
We're Oh No Ross and Kerry

1567
00:59:09,320 --> 00:59:11,740
and we investigate extraordinary claims.

1568
00:59:11,740 --> 00:59:12,720
That's right.

1569
00:59:12,720 --> 00:59:15,420
We investigate extraordinary claims firsthand.

1570
00:59:15,420 --> 00:59:17,300
We go undercover in fringe groups.

1571
00:59:17,300 --> 00:59:19,460
We get alternative medicine treatments

1572
00:59:19,460 --> 00:59:22,480
and we hang out with people who have unusual beliefs

1573
00:59:22,480 --> 00:59:24,660
like flat earthers, 9-11 truthers.

1574
00:59:24,660 --> 00:59:26,100
We do ghost investigations.

1575
00:59:26,100 --> 00:59:27,620
We've joined Scientology

1576
00:59:27,620 --> 00:59:29,460
and we got baptized in the Mormon church.

1577
00:59:29,460 --> 00:59:32,700
If it goes bump in the night, then so do we.

1578
00:59:32,700 --> 00:59:34,500
