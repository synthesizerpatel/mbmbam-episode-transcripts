1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:30,800
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:48,800
Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls from around the globe, it's my brother,

6
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:53,360
my brother, and me, an advice show for the modern era Eurovision special. My name is Justin McElroy.

7
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:58,320
I'm the oldest brother. Oh, I'm Travis McElroy, your middle-est brother. I'm your sweet baby

8
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:02,480
brother Griffin McElroy. Justin, I love how you said Eurovision special really quick

9
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:08,720
and under your breath as if to hide it. I didn't want it to be a big commitment

10
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:13,600
because I don't want to talk about it that much. Oh folks, don't get it twisted. This bit might not

11
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:20,080
work. And so Justin just left himself a little ripcord, a little parachute to get out of it

12
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:23,920
if he needs to. What? I never said that. What are you talking about? I thought I was pressing the

13
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:28,080
cough button. It's funny that you said that, Travis, because many of the performers in Eurovision

14
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:36,640
2016, their acts involved parachutes of multiple kinds. Now, I did not watch Eurovision

15
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:41,840
because I wanted to come at this Eurovision special with fresh eyes as our audience might.

16
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:47,680
I want to be their window in. I want fresh data. Quite a sacrifice. Fresh, dumb, uninformed eyes.

17
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:58,800
Exactly. So tell me it's people from countries that are not America singing songs. It's gotten

18
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:05,360
to the point with the Eurovision contestants where it's starting to feel a bit intentional.

19
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:10,800
Like it is not just Europe, but it's definitely not America. Like that's kind of becoming what

20
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:17,680
they mean by this. Like they only let us watch it this year on the logo, which is such a perfect

21
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:26,080
pairing for it. Here's the thing, fellas. I don't think they can keep America out for too long

22
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:31,200
because we have a special way of getting what we want. We're a little bit of a juggernaut,

23
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:36,880
I think would be the word I would use. I don't want to get dictatorial about it, but

24
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:44,480
what baby want, a baby gonna get. If we levy sanctions against Europe so that we get to

25
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:50,240
participate in Eurovision, maybe that's like the first act of whoever's president in 2017.

26
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:56,320
If we already weren't embargoing them in some way to get me up on that stage. Here's the thing,

27
00:02:56,320 --> 00:03:04,720
my boys, my brother boys. I recently came to the sad realization that even if I started right now

28
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:09,600
and I started working real, real hard and I quit both of my jobs, all of my jobs, my many jobs,

29
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:17,680
I quit all of them and I just dedicated myself to sport, I probably will not be able to qualify

30
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:22,640
for the Rio Olympics in 2016. How many months away is that?

31
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:28,400
Like one. And I was really thinking about like maybe there's some loophole, maybe there's some

32
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:32,640
sport I haven't thought of that if I just really put my nose to the grindstone for 30 days,

33
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:39,600
I could get Olympics good at. Is there like a beanbag cornhole in the Olympics this year?

34
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:45,200
If there was baggos in the Olympics, and God knows I've been petitioning the council for that

35
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:52,400
for a long time, but no, sadly, no. My best chance is beach volleyball and that's even way beyond mine.

36
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:57,040
Even that, those dudes are like nine feet tall. Yeah, and the women are nine feet tall,

37
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:59,120
everyone's nine feet tall, it's a nightmare. Everyone's nine feet tall.

38
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:03,680
And all the dudes got that surgery to sew up all their various cracks and holes

39
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:08,800
to prevent sand infiltration. And to prevent ball passage through.

40
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:12,880
They've made themselves into human kites, essentially. Yeah, basically.

41
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:19,440
So the situation is such that I will not, this is my formal announcement,

42
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:23,920
I will not be attending and competing in the Rio Olympics 2016 games.

43
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:27,920
Even if invited? If invited, you know I'll be there.

44
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:32,000
Okay, this is a boycott. He's not a cad.

45
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,120
No, it's just I don't think I'll be able to do sport that good.

46
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:39,040
So my whole thing is now I'm turning my attention to just what the next thing will be,

47
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:44,480
and I think the next thing will be me representing America in Eurovision 2017,

48
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:50,880
singing my song about patriotism or whatever the situation is in 2017.

49
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:55,200
Here's what I'm confused by, because it seems like there's a structure already in place

50
00:04:55,200 --> 00:05:00,880
of like everybody's got their own idol, American idol, Canadian idol, you know,

51
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:04,000
Britain X Factor, whatever they call it over there.

52
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,520
It feels like it should be like the Miss America pageant,

53
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:12,480
where everybody like wins their idol, and then we have like a world idol.

54
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:17,840
It is essentially like there's the UK's dudes were these two dudes that were on The Voice,

55
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:21,280
and they competed against each other on The Voice, and they were bitter rivals.

56
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:26,240
But then I think, much like in a Japanese visual novel,

57
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:27,440
these two pretty- Or the Mighty Ducks.

58
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:30,080
These two pretty boys- Nope, not exactly like the Mighty Ducks.

59
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:34,000
I was doing a Japanese visual novel joke because these two very pretty boys fell in love,

60
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:37,440
and I don't think that happens in D1, D2, or D3.

61
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:39,600
Tidbit? Hold on.

62
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:40,480
Hold on, wait.

63
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:42,640
Charlie and Banks.

64
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:45,200
I'm writing notes right now that say

65
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:51,920
Mighty Ducks, Japanese visual novel, any boy slash any boy.

66
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:54,240
Okay, we got that one filed away for later.

67
00:05:55,840 --> 00:06:00,000
Can I please do this?

68
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:05,360
Can Griffin just be for America?

69
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:07,040
Can Griffin just do this?

70
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:08,160
I promise not to fuck it up.

71
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:10,000
Like a lot of those boys got up there,

72
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,320
and it was only the boys that fucked it up, I feel like.

73
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:14,480
Yeah. Because the boys would get up there,

74
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:17,360
and they had a guitar.

75
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:19,920
And once I saw a guitar, I was like, I'm not going to enjoy this.

76
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:25,360
What I want is a woman in a dress made out of crystals and light,

77
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:27,920
and then she does a Final Fantasy summon.

78
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:30,320
Those were the best ones.

79
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:31,600
Those are the best ones.

80
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:36,000
The Ukraine did one where she was dancing and light came out of her feet,

81
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,680
and then she sucked up all the light in the entire stadium.

82
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:41,760
All the light flew into her body,

83
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:46,240
and she was glowing, and then she scream sang a sad dirge into the air,

84
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:50,880
and a tree made out Yggdrasil fucking barfed out of her mouth

85
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:53,200
and filled the place with life and beauty.

86
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:56,240
And that's kind of, I think, the style I would go for.

87
00:06:57,520 --> 00:06:59,760
Travis, they've been doing this for 60 years,

88
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:03,040
and it only now occurred to them that maybe they could let us watch

89
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:07,600
this amazing spectacle that they have been hiding from us for all this time,

90
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:10,560
because they were afraid, rightfully so, that we would ruin it.

91
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:13,760
Griffin, step by step, what would your performance be?

92
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:14,880
Walk us through it.

93
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:17,600
So just based on the Eurovision I did watch,

94
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:19,920
it would involve whatever song I sang.

95
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:22,480
Is there a song that has two key changes?

96
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:23,760
How many does Man in the Mirror have?

97
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:26,320
It's got, it can't be previously published.

98
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:27,040
That's one of the rules.

99
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:27,520
Oh, really?

100
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:32,880
Okay, what about Boy in the Reflective Surface?

101
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:33,680
Okay.

102
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:38,640
I'm contemplating the boy in the rockage of us.

103
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:43,680
I'm wondering if we could do things a little differently.

104
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:45,680
Make that transition.

105
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:49,200
Switch it up.

106
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:52,720
There was, I can't remember, I think it was Croatia had this thing,

107
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:53,840
where she looked dope.

108
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:56,640
I think it was Croatia who looked like Robin, essentially.

109
00:07:56,640 --> 00:08:00,640
And she came out and she's wearing like a kind of a big kimono situation.

110
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:02,160
And then there are four monks there.

111
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:04,560
And the four monks did nothing.

112
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:05,440
They just stood behind her.

113
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:08,080
But at one point, two of them came up and tore her dress apart,

114
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:11,120
and she was wearing a better, even cooler armor dress underneath.

115
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:13,680
So like definitely, definitely something like that.

116
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:15,680
Whatever I do, it's going to be opulent.

117
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:16,480
That's for certain.

118
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:21,440
And it's going to involve the consumption and expulsion of light

119
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:22,880
from every pore on my body.

120
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:26,080
One of the coolest things, or the craziest things,

121
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:28,720
or however you want to say it about Eurovision,

122
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:34,160
is that they have, there are like 26 competitors in the finals.

123
00:08:34,160 --> 00:08:38,480
And 10 of the, like 20 of those are from semifinals.

124
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:39,680
One is from the host country.

125
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:42,960
And five of them are the UK, France, Germany, Spain, and Italy.

126
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:45,200
Because they give the most money, so they always get to be there.

127
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:46,000
They get to be, yeah.

128
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,800
That's fucking, that's so good.

129
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:51,440
I like that much transparency in a thing.

130
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:53,680
It's just like, hey, this is what's up.

131
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:56,240
I hope one day one of the countries abuses it.

132
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:58,320
And just like, here is our song.

133
00:08:58,320 --> 00:08:59,600
It's called Time for Fun.

134
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:00,660
Enjoy.

135
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:02,480
You must listen.

136
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:03,600
It's a finalist.

137
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:05,680
It is called A Time for Fart.

138
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:10,320
It's just, there's not even notes.

139
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:11,520
It's just pfft, pfft, pfft.

140
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:13,680
Were you doing Gru from Despicable Me?

141
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:15,120
I don't know what country he's from,

142
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:16,640
but that's what you sounded like.

143
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:18,400
It was just generically European.

144
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:19,200
Okay.

145
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:21,360
Generically European.

146
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:23,920
One thing I will say though,

147
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:28,320
I do hope we can get announcers that aren't quite as scandalous

148
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:31,440
next year for our American Commentation.

149
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:36,400
At one point, a very attractive young man was,

150
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:39,040
they said that he was openly bisexual.

151
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:41,280
And then one of the commentators said,

152
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:46,480
so everybody gets a turn and I'm not sure that's how that works.

153
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:47,040
No.

154
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:50,160
I'm not sure that's what that means.

155
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:54,240
And maybe they were confused because they saw the person

156
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:56,800
and thought they were, you know, a carnival ride.

157
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:59,520
Or maybe I misheard and they thought,

158
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:01,760
they said he's open with his bicycle.

159
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:05,200
So everybody can ride his bicycle.

160
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:07,680
And now, welcome to the stage,

161
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:10,720
a pile of orifices that can sing real nice.

162
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:13,200
I don't think that's how it works, Carson.

163
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:15,760
Anyway, Eurovision Song Contest was amazing.

164
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:17,200
Catch you in 2017.

165
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:18,000
I'm gonna be there.

166
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,280
I still won't be allowed to perform,

167
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:21,280
but if they are, Griffin is ready to answer the call.

168
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:22,560
I would like Griffin to perform

169
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:24,800
and I would like Justin and I to commentate

170
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:26,800
because there would just be a lot of this.

171
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:27,300
What?

172
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:28,800
What?

173
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:29,680
Over and over again.

174
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:30,800
He's amazing.

175
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:35,520
If they don't let the US in, I'm fucking moving to Croatia

176
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:38,640
and I'm gonna make the connections I need to make.

177
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:40,480
I'm gonna grease the right wheels,

178
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:41,600
grease the right elbows.

179
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:45,920
By the way, just like YouTube Eurovision like greatest

180
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:47,680
or Eurovision weirdest or your,

181
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:48,960
if you have no idea what we're talking about,

182
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:50,400
please seek this out.

183
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:52,080
This is like high quality entertainment.

184
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:53,920
Anyway, it's not as high quality as the show

185
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:54,800
we've got prepared for you.

186
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:56,720
So let's get to it.

187
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:58,400
My girlfriend and I just moved to a new city

188
00:10:58,400 --> 00:11:00,320
where we only know a single person.

189
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:01,600
We like this person

190
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:03,920
and she has gladly welcomed us into her group of friends.

191
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:05,200
The trouble is she and her friends

192
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:07,040
are all salaried software developers

193
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:08,560
of big tech companies.

194
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:10,720
My girlfriend and I are artists currently working hourly.

195
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:12,000
We like hanging out with these people,

196
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,560
but they often end up at bars, restaurants, et cetera,

197
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:15,920
that are a bit over our budget.

198
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:18,240
Even game nights can get pricier than we like

199
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:20,800
once we order takeout from their favorite nice places.

200
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:22,720
Brothers, how do we trick our well-to-do friends

201
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:25,600
into adopting our penny pinching lifestyle

202
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:28,560
that's from not so salaried in Seattle?

203
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:31,840
This is really a very tough question.

204
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:32,560
It really is.

205
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:33,520
It's a hard one to start out.

206
00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:35,920
We could have started with a softball scraps.

207
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:36,640
Nope.

208
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:38,800
Hey, this is 303.

209
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:41,360
This is volume two, no more softballs.

210
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:43,360
I've reached a...

211
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:45,120
I don't know how to talk about this

212
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:47,120
without sounding like a complete asshole,

213
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:53,280
but I don't really care so much

214
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:56,640
about the exchange of finances anymore

215
00:11:56,640 --> 00:12:01,120
when it comes to a hang sesh or a dinner with friends.

216
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:03,600
And I think it's just because I'm doing better than I did

217
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:04,880
when we started doing this podcast

218
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:06,960
and I was absolutely coming from the other way.

219
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:08,560
And I was like, oh, when you split the check,

220
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:09,360
it's not right.

221
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:11,280
One person eats a steak, one person eats salad.

222
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:16,960
To me, it's harder for me to get a hang sesh

223
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:18,160
going with my group of friends.

224
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:21,600
And so this stuff doesn't matter as much to me anymore,

225
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:23,840
which I know is not helpful to hear.

226
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:25,920
I mean, it's a little bit, I'm with you.

227
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:26,640
I understand what you're saying.

228
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:28,480
It's also kind of a privileged position.

229
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:29,200
It's a privileged position,

230
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:31,440
but the point I'm trying to make is like,

231
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:33,760
I bet to your friends,

232
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:37,120
it doesn't matter as much that you cannot contribute

233
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:39,520
as much to the hang session.

234
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:40,720
But that's just like,

235
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:43,200
I feel like that's how our group of friends operates.

236
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:44,480
I feel you.

237
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:45,920
Cause every so often,

238
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:47,600
I find myself in a position

239
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:49,600
where I'm able to cover something

240
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:51,040
where I'm like, I've got it.

241
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:52,320
Dinner's on me, right?

242
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:56,560
And you'll occasionally see the other person

243
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:58,960
kind of do that little bit of like slump shoulder.

244
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:02,000
Like, I feel bad that I can't contribute.

245
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,400
And it makes me happy to cover the thing

246
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:05,280
and it doesn't,

247
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:08,240
or if someone's like, just says outright,

248
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:10,240
like, hey, could we go somewhere else?

249
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:11,760
Like, this is a little out of my price range.

250
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:13,120
I'm never gonna judge them for it.

251
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:14,800
No, I'm totally fine with that too.

252
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:15,920
At my point, it's just like,

253
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:19,440
I am so psyched when I can get a board game sesh

254
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:21,520
together with my friends because-

255
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:22,240
You're saying sesh a lot.

256
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:22,560
Huh?

257
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:23,680
You're saying sesh a lot.

258
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:25,680
Am I saying sesh a lot?

259
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:26,720
Like, okay.

260
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:27,360
I'll dial it back.

261
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:32,160
Whenever I'm having a fucking box social with my buds,

262
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:34,720
like, I get so excited to,

263
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:37,040
that that event has come together

264
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:38,960
that like, I just like, I don't really,

265
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:40,480
I don't really,

266
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:43,120
I just don't care if I get dinner.

267
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:44,240
And then that's not coming from like,

268
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:46,560
hmm, my treat, hmm, come together.

269
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:48,480
People feast upon my genera-

270
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:49,920
It's not that, it's just like,

271
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:50,880
I don't give a shit about that.

272
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:52,480
The more important thing to me is like,

273
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:55,440
I'm happy that we all got together.

274
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:55,940
So like-

275
00:13:57,200 --> 00:13:59,040
One thing you can try is that like,

276
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:01,200
if everybody goes through different times,

277
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:02,160
they have a bit more money

278
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:04,400
and there's other ways that like,

279
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:05,360
your friends can contribute.

280
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:10,240
So sometimes we'll go out with like,

281
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:12,080
a couple friend and you know,

282
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:14,480
we'll, I'll cover the check

283
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:16,080
or Sid and I will cover the check.

284
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:17,440
And then after the meal,

285
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:20,080
I'll look at the husband and I'll say,

286
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:21,200
and no, I will help you-

287
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:21,920
No, come on.

288
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:22,400
Yeah.

289
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:24,880
No, but listen, hear me out.

290
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:25,680
I don't want to hear,

291
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:27,120
no, I specifically interrupted you

292
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:28,400
because I didn't want to hear you out.

293
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:30,240
I guess one thing you could try-

294
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:32,400
Hold on, I want to see where he's going with this.

295
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:34,320
No, I will have a little woman.

296
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:36,560
Like, I'll try, like, you say it like that.

297
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:37,760
Like Zon- like Zon-Geef.

298
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:40,640
You say it like Zon-Geef?

299
00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:44,560
No, I will have your woman.

300
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:46,320
Okay, let me give a secondary.

301
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:47,520
Okay, you're doing the drag.

302
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:48,800
I feel like that one got outvoted.

303
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:49,300
Yeah.

304
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:51,200
You're both artists.

305
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:52,320
Congratulations.

306
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:53,600
This problem has been solved.

307
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:55,440
Courtesy of yours truly,

308
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:57,120
Justin McElroy, the king of device.

309
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:58,960
Next time everybody, they get their,

310
00:14:58,960 --> 00:15:03,280
what is it, Sesame Chicken Wings,

311
00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:04,480
Pho, what is it?

312
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:05,520
It's like a good takeout.

313
00:15:05,520 --> 00:15:06,560
Like what's fancy takeout?

314
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:08,480
I only have like eight different Papa John's here.

315
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:10,480
But like you have Pho takeout,

316
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:11,600
you're just like eating your-

317
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:13,360
Now what is Pho takeout?

318
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:16,320
Is that like the restaurant is somehow your rival,

319
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:18,800
your enemy, and they challenge you to eat their food?

320
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:19,920
I don't know what Pho is,

321
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:20,640
but a lot of people are-

322
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:21,680
Well, it's nothing.

323
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:22,560
It's Pho.

324
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:23,280
You mean Pho.

325
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:24,720
Pho?

326
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:25,600
Yeah, dog.

327
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:26,560
What?

328
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:29,120
The O has like a fun line over it.

329
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:32,480
That sounds like you're gonna finish a word

330
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:34,480
and like bail halfway through, like Pho.

331
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:36,080
Can I get some fun soup?

332
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:36,880
All right, let me try.

333
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:40,560
Let's say you're getting like really nice pizza

334
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:44,000
and you get like, they order from a place that puts like gold in it

335
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,600
and you are eating it.

336
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:49,120
And as you're eating it, because you're an artist,

337
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:51,600
you can just look at the person who picks up the check

338
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:55,040
and say, congratulations, you're now a patron of the arts.

339
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:56,320
Cause that, think about it.

340
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:59,600
They're helping to support putting more artistic works

341
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:03,040
out into the world because they're helping to keep you fed.

342
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:06,800
They're giving you pizza fuel so that you can make artworks.

343
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:09,680
If you're an artist, you are never mooching.

344
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:14,160
You are allowing patronage to occur.

345
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:15,840
It's a beautiful system that's been in place

346
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:17,040
since the middle ages.

347
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:19,440
And who are we to upset that particular alcove?

348
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:21,760
Take a pepperoni off the za and especially one

349
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:23,600
that has a pool of grease in it.

350
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:26,560
And then you take a parchment and then you do a little doodle.

351
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:28,320
Look at this political cartoon I made.

352
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:30,960
You take two of the garlic breadsticks

353
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:33,600
and you stick forks in them like Penny and June.

354
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:35,600
And you say, look, I do performance art.

355
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:36,720
You just help pay for it.

356
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:38,640
And then you just eat the breadsticks.

357
00:16:38,640 --> 00:16:40,960
It also, if it comes down to it,

358
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:44,480
maybe you plan an event every so often

359
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:46,400
and try to work that into the rotation

360
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:48,080
of you guys all hanging out.

361
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:49,920
Then you have a little bit more control over

362
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:52,400
what the cost of everything is

363
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:54,000
and what the spending of everything is.

364
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:54,320
And-

365
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:56,320
But this, this hard thing is like,

366
00:16:57,440 --> 00:16:58,400
I know what you're saying, Trav,

367
00:16:58,400 --> 00:17:01,360
but like the hard thing is like, it's also not,

368
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:04,080
I mean, this is shitty, but like,

369
00:17:04,080 --> 00:17:05,520
this is such a pervasive thing.

370
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:08,080
Like this happens for a lot of people who are like,

371
00:17:08,080 --> 00:17:11,360
everybody's at the same social economic strata

372
00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:14,080
in college, basically, because, or, you know,

373
00:17:14,080 --> 00:17:15,120
high school and college, because like,

374
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:17,760
everybody's doing, nobody has a job.

375
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:18,640
Like nobody has a job.

376
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:22,800
And then it gets like stratified over the years after it.

377
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:25,840
And it's like, it's not fair for this couple to like,

378
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:28,080
try to get everybody to do something

379
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:31,360
that is like less expensive.

380
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:31,920
You know what I mean?

381
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:33,440
Like, cause it's not a concern to them.

382
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:36,320
I think the bigger, the bigger issue is in that,

383
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:37,360
in that first sentence of the question,

384
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:38,560
when they say they just moved here

385
00:17:38,560 --> 00:17:40,720
and they really only know one of these folks.

386
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:41,920
And so like, I feel like,

387
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:45,360
I've never stopped hanging out with somebody

388
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:49,360
because we were in different economic strata or whatever,

389
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:53,440
but I can understand how that discomfort could be magnified

390
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:56,320
based on the fact that you are new to this group.

391
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:58,560
And so it's sort of, yeah.

392
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:00,720
It's a little bit harder to be like,

393
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:04,080
I can't afford it and not expect a judgment

394
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:05,600
cause you don't know these people as well.

395
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:07,040
I still don't think there'll be any judgment,

396
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:08,880
unless these people are like complete jags.

397
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:10,000
There won't be judgment.

398
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,920
It'll be self-inflicted, right?

399
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:13,760
It's an emotional toll it takes on you.

400
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:15,680
Like, cause you do feel that way.

401
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:17,040
Like even if the other people don't care,

402
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:19,280
like I think people like, I like,

403
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:22,880
I look for opportunities where I can like,

404
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:25,360
do this kind of stuff

405
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:27,440
because I like taking care of people,

406
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:28,800
but I know that that also has like,

407
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:33,680
you know, some people that sort of grates on them.

408
00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:37,280
And you know, I also bet that like these people

409
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:39,360
look at you with a tinge of jealousy

410
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:41,120
because you guys get to like create art

411
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:43,360
and like, they may love their jobs,

412
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:45,280
but like wish that they could be artists

413
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:46,400
and you know, that kind of thing.

414
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:48,400
Like everybody has something in their lives

415
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:50,560
that everybody else looks at and goes,

416
00:18:50,560 --> 00:18:51,840
I wish I could do that.

417
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:52,320
Yeah.

418
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:52,960
You know what I mean?

419
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:54,960
So it's not like their lives are perfect

420
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:57,040
and you guys are not doing it, right?

421
00:18:57,040 --> 00:18:58,640
Just everybody has a different path.

422
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:00,240
A lot of people look at me and they say,

423
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:03,920
I wish I could sing and spin at the same time

424
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:06,320
like Griffin does for his Eurovision performance.

425
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:07,920
And I say, it's really hard to do

426
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:09,600
because like a lot of people can sing,

427
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:11,600
a lot of people can spin, doing both at once.

428
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:13,760
It's really tricky.

429
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:15,440
Can I move on to this,

430
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:17,200
as long as we're talking about fungible financial,

431
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:18,960
fungible matters.

432
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:20,560
I'd love to discuss a relevant.

433
00:19:20,560 --> 00:19:22,960
That was my favorite TGIF show.

434
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:23,840
Fungible matters.

435
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:26,560
Everywhere you look,

436
00:19:26,560 --> 00:19:28,720
that's not the theme song to Family Matters.

437
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:32,480
This one was sent in by Rob Van Lipwig.

438
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:32,960
Thank you, Rob.

439
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:34,320
It's by Yahoo Answers user.

440
00:19:35,680 --> 00:19:36,480
Oh, okay.

441
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:37,840
Well, okay.

442
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:38,960
All right.

443
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:43,600
So this Yahoo Answers user has BRAC as their user icon.

444
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:45,200
So I got really excited about what the name would be,

445
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:46,160
but then I hovered over it

446
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:48,320
and the name is BRAC Hates Hillary Clinton.

447
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:49,200
No.

448
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:50,240
Okay.

449
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:51,040
Which I don't know.

450
00:19:51,040 --> 00:19:51,760
I don't think that's,

451
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:54,320
I think you may be projecting a little bit.

452
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:57,120
Anyway, this person says,

453
00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:59,200
how would you handle students

454
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:02,000
who charge your son or daughter $1

455
00:20:02,560 --> 00:20:05,840
each time he or she farts in class?

456
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:07,680
That's so open.

457
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:08,960
That's what you're going to say.

458
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:10,560
You were hoping I was,

459
00:20:10,560 --> 00:20:11,360
you were,

460
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:13,600
at what point did you start hoping for that?

461
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:16,640
He waited with bated breath.

462
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:18,000
How would you handle students

463
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,160
who charge your son or daughter $1

464
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:22,640
each time he or she farts in class?

465
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:24,640
I love this because I think-

466
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:25,920
Oh, you love this.

467
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:27,440
Well, there's an inherent implication

468
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:29,440
that it has happened enough

469
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:32,000
that they had to establish punitive measures.

470
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:32,560
Yeah.

471
00:20:32,560 --> 00:20:35,280
Well, this was like the swear jar in the office.

472
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:37,040
That it was like, no, you know what, Derek?

473
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:37,520
Fine.

474
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:40,080
You want to do it every time it's a dollar.

475
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:41,120
Now, do you want to do it?

476
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:42,320
Oh, you're still doing it.

477
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:43,120
$5.

478
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:47,680
I would want this because this could turn into

479
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:52,800
a very weird potentially profitable form of bullying.

480
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:54,720
Potentially profitable form of bullying

481
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:59,760
because if in the wrong hands,

482
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:02,400
this law keeper would just be like,

483
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:03,920
I heard that cheesy blaster.

484
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:04,560
Give me a buck.

485
00:21:04,560 --> 00:21:05,840
And it's like, I didn't, I didn't.

486
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:06,880
Guys, I didn't.

487
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:07,840
I didn't blast one.

488
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:08,560
That wasn't me.

489
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:11,120
These are a little higher pitch.

490
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:12,240
That's how you can tell.

491
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:13,600
I would almost want this to be

492
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:15,280
either like an elected position

493
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:17,040
or like a captain of the safety patrol.

494
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:18,400
Maybe just the captain of the safety patrol

495
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:19,440
is the one that does it.

496
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:21,280
The question is,

497
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:23,920
is it everybody is held to the same standard

498
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:25,440
or is it just one kid?

499
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:26,320
Right.

500
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:30,320
Can he buy somebody else's carbon offset credits

501
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:32,560
to like blow some more

502
00:21:32,560 --> 00:21:34,320
if they aren't particularly tooty?

503
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:35,840
That's a good point.

504
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:38,160
Another form of corruption is you just bribe

505
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:43,680
the justicar and say like,

506
00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:45,920
how about you let me get off scot-free?

507
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:47,280
I'll give you five for 10.

508
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:51,040
I also wonder if you can like,

509
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:54,160
if you do pay the dollar,

510
00:21:54,160 --> 00:21:56,480
that's the system that's been put in place here.

511
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:57,920
If you do pay the dollar,

512
00:21:57,920 --> 00:22:03,600
do you then get to fart without any sort of like shame?

513
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:05,360
Like you pay ahead, you pay it forward.

514
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:06,960
You say like, here's 10 for the day.

515
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:08,000
Leave me alone.

516
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,480
I'm just gonna be ripped nonstop.

517
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:12,240
Here's a GameStop pre-order

518
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:16,800
for the fart I'm gonna do at 3.15 p.m. today.

519
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:18,800
Look forward to that.

520
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:19,840
Where does the money go?

521
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:22,320
Do you think it just goes into a pool for the whole class

522
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:26,080
or is there one specific kid who's fucking this?

523
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:27,440
Fucking Cedar Point.

524
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:30,000
It's like a big class trip.

525
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,760
It's like, damn, thanks, Michael.

526
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:35,680
Keep eating that fibrous food, my boy.

527
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:42,160
I'm glad you like that hummus, Michael.

528
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:47,120
Damn, Michael, I'm having a fun time on this roller coaster.

529
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:49,920
Glad you're lactose intolerant as fuck, Mikey.

530
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:00,320
I wish Mikey could have been here with us

531
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:02,240
on this roller coaster trip he paid for,

532
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:08,240
but unfortunately his parents had to sell their house.

533
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:10,160
He dung tooted their savings away.

534
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:11,600
The law's the law.

535
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:13,280
This kid's tooting me at a house at home.

536
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:14,320
I wish it was up to me.

537
00:23:15,920 --> 00:23:18,240
Man, this is the best fart trip we've ever been on, guys.

538
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:23,440
Next year, let's really up all the sort of high protein beanie foods

539
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:25,120
and let's get to Cabo.

540
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:26,800
We had a great time, Ms. Frizzle.

541
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:34,800
Oh, Ms. Frizzle, let's fart our way to Cabo.

542
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:37,040
What if the teacher had to pay?

543
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:38,320
What's the only one?

544
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:41,120
Like any time someone in the class farted,

545
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:43,760
the teacher was the one paying the tax.

546
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:46,240
What sense does that make?

547
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:49,760
Teachers are already not making enough money.

548
00:23:50,560 --> 00:23:52,720
And now they're having to pay for their students' toots?

549
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:55,840
I think it's like cab rules, right?

550
00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:57,520
Like they have to hang signs up in cabs now

551
00:23:57,520 --> 00:23:59,120
because human beings are awful.

552
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:01,760
And it's like, hey, I have to drive around in this car all day.

553
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:03,760
Just don't, please don't.

554
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:05,760
I think the teachers operate by the same rule set.

555
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:07,840
Like you can move on in third period,

556
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:09,840
you get to leave and go study science,

557
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:13,280
but your specter hangs out here in this room

558
00:24:13,280 --> 00:24:14,320
I have to be in all day.

559
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:15,680
I think the teacher gets a buck.

560
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:18,240
I think a teacher gets the buck.

561
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:19,920
Well, they're definitely getting their beeg way

562
00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:21,520
in this whole you pay a buck for it.

563
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:23,200
Like maybe they're getting a quarter per buck.

564
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:25,440
Oh, they're definitely getting the juice somewhere.

565
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:27,280
Yeah, the Vig.

566
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:30,880
It's going towards their 401k, you know what I mean?

567
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:33,280
I'm worried we've been indelicate.

568
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:35,360
I'm worried we've been indelicate

569
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:38,480
because I'm looking at the answers that people have said

570
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:40,720
and they're all very concerned.

571
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:42,400
I would talk to the school.

572
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:44,480
Any act of being mean or extorting another student

573
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:45,840
is being an actual bully.

574
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:47,120
If the school principal won't do anything,

575
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:47,920
go to the school board.

576
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:49,440
If they won't do anything, raise hell.

577
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:51,680
Start calling news stations and create a Facebook post

578
00:24:51,680 --> 00:24:52,640
on the school site.

579
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:54,480
Try to get, oh, thanks dad.

580
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:58,960
Oh, my flatulent son is getting bullied so bad.

581
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:10,480
Next on WCHS news, this cave farts a bunch.

582
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:13,920
Oh my God, you all, you wouldn't believe it.

583
00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:15,440
Anyway, this is bullying

584
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:17,360
and not just like a once or twice thing.

585
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:18,960
That's the thing.

586
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:20,640
Just so we get it right on the lower third,

587
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:22,880
the last name is Stinkmeister.

588
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:24,480
No, I told you already.

589
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:26,320
That's not it.

590
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:27,680
It's Stonkenmeester.

591
00:25:27,680 --> 00:25:29,680
Stonkenmeester, please.

592
00:25:29,680 --> 00:25:31,680
I don't know which side of this I come down on.

593
00:25:31,680 --> 00:25:34,960
I feel like, Justin, you're a parent now.

594
00:25:35,920 --> 00:25:38,800
Yeah, I kind of feel like it depends

595
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:40,560
on how the bully comports himself.

596
00:25:40,560 --> 00:25:42,720
Like I feel like if it's very,

597
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:46,720
if it's like, give me a dollar 40, it's bad.

598
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:49,120
But if he's like, listen, I hate that.

599
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:50,880
I hate that I have to do this.

600
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:52,480
But you know, it's out of my hands.

601
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:55,840
What if he's got a little like green visor

602
00:25:55,840 --> 00:25:57,920
and like some like sleeve garters

603
00:25:57,920 --> 00:25:58,960
and every time there's a fart,

604
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:00,240
he just like taps it into

605
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:02,480
like a paper calculator printer thing

606
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:03,600
and like pulls out a handle

607
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:04,880
and he's like, that's one more.

608
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:07,680
And it's not, there's no bullying to it whatsoever.

609
00:26:07,680 --> 00:26:10,400
This is just like a matter of fact,

610
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:12,400
exchange of goods and services.

611
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:13,760
You fart, it's a dollar period.

612
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:17,120
What's the punishment if you don't pay up though?

613
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:17,920
Prison?

614
00:26:17,920 --> 00:26:18,960
They break your legs.

615
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:19,840
Oh God.

616
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:21,200
Oh yeah, yeah, they break your legs.

617
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:24,160
What if you have a chair that just like squeaks weird?

618
00:26:25,040 --> 00:26:28,320
Okay, let me pose this to you guys.

619
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:31,120
Travel back in time in your minds

620
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:32,560
to when you were in like middle school,

621
00:26:32,560 --> 00:26:33,920
high school, elementary school.

622
00:26:33,920 --> 00:26:34,720
Yeah.

623
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:37,120
If you knew you could pay a dollar

624
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:42,000
and if you paid, you would receive no ridicule for farting.

625
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:43,200
This is what I was saying, Travis.

626
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:44,880
Like this is what I'm saying.

627
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:46,560
I think it's worth it

628
00:26:46,560 --> 00:26:49,200
if it's like, I don't have to lie about this.

629
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:50,480
I don't have to fucking be ashamed.

630
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:55,280
One time a kid pretended that I farted in class

631
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:59,680
and it was, this kid pretended that I farted in class

632
00:26:59,680 --> 00:27:00,720
and he was a friend of mine

633
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:02,400
but he pretended that I farted in class

634
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:04,160
after I think he farted.

635
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:07,920
And I got so mad at him that I picked up a pencil

636
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:09,520
and jammed it into his thigh.

637
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:10,240
Jesus.

638
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:15,840
And I got, had a little bit of trouble with the higher ups.

639
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:17,920
But like-

640
00:27:17,920 --> 00:27:19,200
That whole thing could have been avoided

641
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:20,800
with the proper exchange of-

642
00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:22,320
If I could have been like, yeah, I guess so.

643
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:23,920
Pay the man.

644
00:27:23,920 --> 00:27:24,240
Yeah.

645
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:25,920
Pay the man his fart money.

646
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:28,240
Like fart bounties could be,

647
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:30,480
could really help to eliminate the embarrassment.

648
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:30,960
Right?

649
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:32,480
You can just do it because it's human.

650
00:27:33,040 --> 00:27:35,120
You should have to pay a price.

651
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:36,400
There should be a price.

652
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:37,760
You're admitting,

653
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:40,800
this would be a great way to teach kids about the carbon tax though.

654
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:43,360
Like, yes, I understand that you have to admit these gases.

655
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:47,280
You are going to pay for what you've admitted into our lungs.

656
00:27:47,280 --> 00:27:49,520
I just think that there's a whole sliding scale

657
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:51,680
you could set up to pay off,

658
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:57,440
like what is your penance to pay off embarrassment tax in school?

659
00:27:57,440 --> 00:27:58,640
Where it's just like,

660
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:01,440
oh, like I, whatever,

661
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:03,120
feeling that I farted in class

662
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:05,920
or like I accidentally called the teacher mommy.

663
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:06,560
You know what I mean?

664
00:28:06,560 --> 00:28:09,120
Here's $2 and now I can't get made fun of.

665
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:10,560
That would actually be a great equalizer

666
00:28:10,560 --> 00:28:13,440
for this fungible strata that we discussed earlier.

667
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:16,240
Because like, if there's a kid in your class who's like really rich,

668
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:18,720
then you could just assume that they need all that money

669
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:20,960
to pay off like the farts that they do.

670
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:24,640
And so like a rich kid is no longer like in charge of the school, right?

671
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:27,120
The rich kid is now this like,

672
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:31,440
oh, you must need all of your parents' money because of-

673
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:33,280
You're a fart lover.

674
00:28:33,280 --> 00:28:33,680
Yeah.

675
00:28:33,680 --> 00:28:35,280
This has been, this got weird.

676
00:28:35,280 --> 00:28:36,480
Can we do another question?

677
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:38,320
Man, I'm still trying to get myself together.

678
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:40,560
I really, for a 35 year old,

679
00:28:40,560 --> 00:28:42,960
like I do think farts are very funny.

680
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:43,440
Oh yeah.

681
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:46,000
Like I've been doing this show for a while.

682
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:47,920
You'd think I'd be a nerd too, but man, oh man.

683
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:53,360
A good friend of mine has a deathly fear of alligators.

684
00:28:53,360 --> 00:28:55,600
She is petrified by the very thought of them.

685
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:58,000
She even sees a picture of one, she freaks out.

686
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:59,600
Now this might be a legitimate fear,

687
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:01,120
except for one tiny detail.

688
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:02,560
She lives in Colorado.

689
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:05,120
Alex, that's gator country.

690
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:07,680
There was a night when she heard a noise

691
00:29:07,680 --> 00:29:10,560
on her second story balcony and was too petrified to move

692
00:29:10,560 --> 00:29:12,720
because she was convinced that a gator

693
00:29:13,280 --> 00:29:14,960
had climbed into her balcony.

694
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:17,760
It was flipping around out there and trying to get in.

695
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:18,480
Jesus.

696
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:22,560
How can I get her over this ridiculous phobia?

697
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:25,520
That's from Captain Hook's best friend in the Rockies.

698
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:28,800
And they call me, I'm the world's greatest cat burglar.

699
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:31,680
And they call me the gator because of my ability

700
00:29:31,680 --> 00:29:35,120
to scale walls and flip around until I open a door.

701
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:36,960
I feel like they're terrifying.

702
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:37,760
Yeah, they're not good.

703
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:39,840
I sleep on the second story of my house.

704
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:42,800
If I look out the window and see a gator like flapping

705
00:29:42,800 --> 00:29:44,000
his stupid tail against the window,

706
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,080
I'm gonna let that bad boy in because he earned it.

707
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:46,560
Come get what you need.

708
00:29:46,560 --> 00:29:47,520
What's his story?

709
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:49,200
What's your story to tell you?

710
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:50,560
Come take what you need, stud.

711
00:29:50,560 --> 00:29:52,640
You've earned it getting all the way up here.

712
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:54,000
You scrappy little lizard.

713
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:54,480
Come on.

714
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:55,040
Come on, bud.

715
00:29:55,040 --> 00:29:56,000
Come on in.

716
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:56,480
Come on in.

717
00:29:56,480 --> 00:29:57,760
Come get what you need.

718
00:29:57,760 --> 00:30:06,320
I was totally immune to both the terror projection ability

719
00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:11,120
of alligators and also the seductive potential

720
00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:11,920
of alligators.

721
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:17,360
They were a non-threat in my mind until I learned

722
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:20,560
that those motherfuckers can run at like 40 miles an hour.

723
00:30:20,560 --> 00:30:21,600
And that's crazy.

724
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,160
They can run as fast as a moped.

725
00:30:26,160 --> 00:30:27,280
And that's crazy.

726
00:30:27,280 --> 00:30:29,280
And then that's when I kind of got it.

727
00:30:29,280 --> 00:30:32,240
Because if you've seen the gator, that's too late.

728
00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:36,400
Okay, I've never seen that happen ever.

729
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:39,360
And that sounds like some bullshit that alligators started.

730
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:41,760
Don't even fuck with us.

731
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:43,600
We can run real, real fast.

732
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:45,520
Yo, Lab Coat, get over here.

733
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:46,240
Guess what?

734
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:47,840
I can run 40 miles an hour.

735
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:48,800
Put that in a book.

736
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:50,560
Write it down.

737
00:30:50,560 --> 00:30:51,520
Write it down.

738
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:53,440
If it's in the book, I don't have to do it.

739
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:55,200
Also, I'm bulletproof.

740
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:56,560
Yeah, bulletproof.

741
00:30:56,560 --> 00:31:00,880
It says here in this reptile book that alligators can run 40 miles an hour.

742
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:05,280
And that the boy gators have just big, great ding-dongs.

743
00:31:05,280 --> 00:31:06,080
And they love to...

744
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:11,840
It says here boy gators have had sex with just like so many lady gators.

745
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:13,040
Like it's insane.

746
00:31:13,040 --> 00:31:15,040
And then all the lady gators like loved it.

747
00:31:15,040 --> 00:31:18,160
And that boy gators have a bunch of money.

748
00:31:18,160 --> 00:31:18,960
This is crazy.

749
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:20,880
This book is just a crazy book.

750
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:24,800
It says this in the book that if you feed an alligator a raw steak,

751
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:27,600
he'll spit out a Ferrero Rocher and grant you a wish.

752
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:28,640
That's crazy.

753
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:29,200
That's crazy.

754
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:33,920
Who would have ever thought that like would be the way that gators work in Tesla?

755
00:31:33,920 --> 00:31:37,920
It says here if gators, if you're a kid and you just jump in a gator's mouth,

756
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:41,120
then there's a Game Boy in there.

757
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:44,000
There's a Game Boy in that gator's mouth.

758
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:44,400
That's crazy.

759
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:46,880
There's a Game Boy in there and it's got Pokemon in it.

760
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:50,480
And then the cartridge has all the Pokemon pre-caught and they're all level 99.

761
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:51,360
That's crazy.

762
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:57,200
And inside of every gator, there's just a fucking binder

763
00:31:57,200 --> 00:32:00,720
and it has all of the Pokemon cards in it all the way up to Gen 6.

764
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:01,760
That's fucking nuts.

765
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:02,800
Anyway, get in there.

766
00:32:02,800 --> 00:32:04,080
It also says it's risk-free.

767
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:04,800
Get in there, kids.

768
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:05,840
Get in there, young Griffin.

769
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:06,320
Get in there.

770
00:32:08,560 --> 00:32:09,680
And that's how Griffin died.

771
00:32:09,680 --> 00:32:11,040
And that's how Griffin died.

772
00:32:11,040 --> 00:32:16,000
I think the problem here is that your friend is afraid of the idea of alligators.

773
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:17,760
Which is horrifying.

774
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:22,480
And you need to do a little immersion therapy.

775
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:24,720
You need to take her to a gator farm.

776
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:27,520
I'm not saying throw her in a pit with some gators.

777
00:32:27,520 --> 00:32:31,920
I'm saying you need to take her to one of those gator shows

778
00:32:31,920 --> 00:32:33,760
where a burly person wrestles a gator.

779
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:35,440
Has sex with an alligator.

780
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:36,160
No.

781
00:32:36,160 --> 00:32:36,880
Oh, sorry.

782
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:37,120
No.

783
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,080
Where they wrestle the alligator and you say,

784
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:45,440
see that person just totally dominated that alligator.

785
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:47,360
You don't have to be afraid anymore.

786
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:50,320
It's like when I saw when I was like six

787
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:52,640
and I saw Resident Evil being played by you guys

788
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:54,720
and I was afraid of zombies for like two years

789
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:59,040
until I watched a man have sex with a zombie, I guess.

790
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:03,680
And then it was like, all right, we can beat this thing together.

791
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,000
I think dressing up like a gator is good.

792
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:11,040
Like, and just refusing until she gets over it.

793
00:33:11,040 --> 00:33:13,520
Because then it's like, oh my, it gets confusing.

794
00:33:13,520 --> 00:33:17,680
Like, I'm afraid of alligators but my best friend's an alligator.

795
00:33:17,680 --> 00:33:19,280
I don't really, maybe I'm not as afraid of them

796
00:33:19,280 --> 00:33:19,920
as I thought I was.

797
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:22,240
Maybe a baby gator.

798
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:23,200
They're really cute.

799
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:24,320
They're not bad.

800
00:33:24,320 --> 00:33:24,640
Yeah.

801
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:26,880
Get them an egg with a gator in it

802
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:28,720
and have them raise it from birth.

803
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:30,480
Yeah, say there's a bird in there, I bet.

804
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:32,000
You follow them up with this egg.

805
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:33,280
There's a bird in there, I think.

806
00:33:33,280 --> 00:33:35,920
And then when it hatches, you're like, listen, I understand.

807
00:33:35,920 --> 00:33:38,640
Trust me, this is the scariest part of what's happening.

808
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:41,040
The reveal, like, wait for the prestige.

809
00:33:41,040 --> 00:33:42,640
Tomorrow's gonna be good.

810
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:43,760
Today's gonna be bad.

811
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:45,520
The hatching day will be bad.

812
00:33:45,520 --> 00:33:48,240
The hatching will be bad.

813
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:53,760
I swear to God, Susan, I thought there was a bird in there.

814
00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:54,880
I thought I was just giving you an advice.

815
00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:56,960
The egg guy told me it was a bird egg.

816
00:33:56,960 --> 00:33:59,920
I don't know what to tell you, but we have to keep it legally.

817
00:34:00,560 --> 00:34:04,560
A special alligator killing eagle is what he said to me.

818
00:34:04,560 --> 00:34:05,760
Maybe it turns into that.

819
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:08,160
Maybe it will evolve into a bird.

820
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:11,040
I'm out $17.

821
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:13,360
How do you think I feel?

822
00:34:13,360 --> 00:34:15,600
That was solid fart money I could have spent.

823
00:34:15,600 --> 00:34:18,320
I had 17 farts down the drain.

824
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:21,600
Or back up the drain, I guess.

825
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:25,440
Speaking of fart money, let's get the money set.

826
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:36,720
I want to tell you about Trunk Club.

827
00:34:37,360 --> 00:34:38,160
Yes.

828
00:34:38,160 --> 00:34:39,680
And you can't stop me.

829
00:34:39,680 --> 00:34:43,840
So everybody today, across the board, no matter what age,

830
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:47,280
whether you're nine months old or 99 months old,

831
00:34:48,080 --> 00:34:49,520
you don't know how to dress yourself.

832
00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:50,560
Yeah, really old.

833
00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:51,760
You don't know how to dress yourself.

834
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:53,120
You're a mess.

835
00:34:53,120 --> 00:34:53,840
Look at yourself.

836
00:34:54,400 --> 00:34:55,360
What a good news.

837
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:57,600
There's Trunk Club, and Trunk Club has lots of people

838
00:34:57,600 --> 00:34:59,200
who can tell you how to dress yourself

839
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:01,680
and help you find really, really cool clothes

840
00:35:01,680 --> 00:35:02,960
that will fill.

841
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:04,720
I found a pair of jeans at Trunk Club

842
00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:08,240
that was the jeans I've dreamed about my entire life.

843
00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:10,240
And I didn't know that jeans like this existed

844
00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:11,840
until Trunk Club helped me find them.

845
00:35:11,840 --> 00:35:13,280
You found your dream jeans.

846
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:14,080
My dream jeans.

847
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:17,280
They've got personal stylists that will talk to you,

848
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:19,360
walk you through stuff, and work together with you

849
00:35:19,360 --> 00:35:20,960
to find the looks that you're looking for.

850
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:24,240
And how it works is they send you the stuff

851
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:27,120
and then you keep what you like

852
00:35:27,120 --> 00:35:28,960
and you send back what you don't

853
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:30,240
and you pay for what you keep.

854
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:32,880
So you don't end up with a bunch of shit

855
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:34,640
that you don't like and you're stuck with it

856
00:35:34,640 --> 00:35:35,920
and you've already paid for it.

857
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:37,440
You actually get to try it on,

858
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:38,880
show it to your friends and family

859
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:40,560
and say like, what do you think?

860
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:41,520
Okay, great.

861
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:42,480
And then you keep it.

862
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:43,520
So if you wanna check it out,

863
00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:46,720
you can go to trunkclub.com slash my brother

864
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:51,120
and check it out and maybe work with a stylist.

865
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:54,000
Check out some shit.

866
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:57,440
See, I'm telling you, I got an outfit from Trunk Club

867
00:35:57,440 --> 00:36:00,800
that is my new like, I'm going out to a concert.

868
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:03,200
It's your new Doug Funny uniform.

869
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:04,080
It's my new Doug Funny.

870
00:36:04,080 --> 00:36:09,440
It's my on and off court buddies.

871
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:11,520
I wanna tell you guys about Dunk Club.

872
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:13,200
Now this is a new club I've started.

873
00:36:14,080 --> 00:36:17,200
And basically what it is, is you pay me directly.

874
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:19,120
That's the best part of the service.

875
00:36:19,120 --> 00:36:20,320
No middleman, just me.

876
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:21,440
And you pay me directly

877
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:23,760
and I'll come to your house every day,

878
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:27,920
every single day, whether you want me to or not.

879
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:30,480
And I'll just show you one of my dunks.

880
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:32,240
And it's not really an educational thing.

881
00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:34,320
Like I'm not there teaching you new and exciting

882
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:35,680
and explosive dunks.

883
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:39,280
It's just like, you just get to watch me do one.

884
00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:41,360
And it's just one dunk a day.

885
00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:43,680
Please don't ask me to repeat the dunk

886
00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:44,800
because I absolutely won't do it.

887
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:45,840
And you're just gonna make it uncomfortable.

888
00:36:45,840 --> 00:36:47,040
And you know I'm gonna be there tomorrow.

889
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:51,120
So like, it's important that we maintain like a sort of balance

890
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:53,360
in our professional relationship.

891
00:36:53,360 --> 00:36:55,280
But yeah, just come to your house and do one dunk every day.

892
00:36:56,160 --> 00:36:56,800
Oh.

893
00:36:56,800 --> 00:36:59,120
I really only know how to do the one dunk.

894
00:36:59,120 --> 00:37:01,280
And it's just, I have two hands over my head

895
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:02,480
and I jump as high as I can.

896
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:04,080
And let's see what happens.

897
00:37:04,080 --> 00:37:05,680
But you do it over and over and over.

898
00:37:05,680 --> 00:37:06,640
Yeah, every day.

899
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:08,000
Can I tell you about-

900
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:11,280
So go check out trunkclub.com slash my brother.

901
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:13,840
I want to tell you guys about Blue Apron.

902
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:17,360
Now this isn't, now it has the same name

903
00:37:17,360 --> 00:37:18,240
as the other Blue Apron.

904
00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:19,520
But this is another club I've started

905
00:37:19,520 --> 00:37:21,200
where I'll come to your house every day and do a dunk.

906
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:23,520
In an apron?

907
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:24,480
In a Blue Apron.

908
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:26,640
Yeah, it's kind of like a comedy thing.

909
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:28,640
No, Blue Apron is-

910
00:37:28,640 --> 00:37:30,240
And you just see how dinner is served

911
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:31,600
as you slam the dunk.

912
00:37:31,600 --> 00:37:34,320
Right, as I slammed the dunk right into the dunk hole.

913
00:37:35,600 --> 00:37:37,440
No, Blue Apron is amazing.

914
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:39,440
All of us, I'm pretty sure use it.

915
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:40,320
We all use it, right?

916
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:41,040
I use it.

917
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:41,600
Okay, yeah.

918
00:37:41,600 --> 00:37:42,320
Big fan.

919
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:43,280
It's fucking incredible.

920
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:45,760
Ate it yesterday, gonna eat it today.

921
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:47,760
They send you ingredients that you need

922
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:49,120
to cook incredible meals.

923
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:51,040
With the highest quality standards

924
00:37:51,040 --> 00:37:53,360
for their community of artisanal suppliers,

925
00:37:53,360 --> 00:37:55,920
family-run farms, fisheries, and ranchers.

926
00:37:55,920 --> 00:37:58,000
We talk a lot about how you get the recipes

927
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:00,320
and then you make the good meals.

928
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:02,160
Stuff like Japanese ramen noodles

929
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:04,160
and I had a salmon salad yesterday

930
00:38:04,160 --> 00:38:05,440
that was like really, really good.

931
00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:08,320
The meals available in May include stuff

932
00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:10,960
like crispy cod and cabbage slaw tacos

933
00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:14,240
with pepita, pineapple, and avocado salsa.

934
00:38:14,240 --> 00:38:16,080
I know, I got some General Tso's chicken upstairs.

935
00:38:16,080 --> 00:38:17,440
General Tso's chicken, yeah.

936
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:19,040
Yeah, I'm excited about that one.

937
00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:21,200
Middle Eastern chicken and chickpea stew

938
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:22,560
with pita croutons.

939
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:23,840
That sounds good.

940
00:38:23,840 --> 00:38:26,320
Got some pita or some pan-seared pork chops

941
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:28,960
with two cheese mashed potatoes and sauteed spinach.

942
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:30,080
Like the meals are very, very good

943
00:38:30,080 --> 00:38:31,520
but like what's also really cool

944
00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:33,040
is that the meals usually share

945
00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:36,240
like a common ingredient that's like farm to table

946
00:38:36,240 --> 00:38:37,840
and like really fresh in season

947
00:38:37,840 --> 00:38:38,560
and really, really good.

948
00:38:38,560 --> 00:38:41,040
So anyway, you can check out this week's menu

949
00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:44,240
and get your first two meals free with free shipping

950
00:38:44,240 --> 00:38:46,480
by going to blueapron.com slash my brother.

951
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:48,240
It's blueapron.com slash my brother.

952
00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:50,000
Blue Apron, a better way to cook.

953
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:51,360
Seriously, we all use it.

954
00:38:51,360 --> 00:38:52,080
It's changed my life.

955
00:38:52,080 --> 00:38:53,440
We love it a lot, go check it out.

956
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:55,200
I did not cook before we started doing it

957
00:38:55,200 --> 00:38:57,600
and now I cook a few times a week and it's amazing.

958
00:38:58,640 --> 00:39:02,880
I've got a Jumbotron message to Ashley

959
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:03,840
from her husband, Ben.

960
00:39:03,840 --> 00:39:05,280
It says, happy fifth anniversary.

961
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:07,760
I can't think of a better way to say I love you

962
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:09,840
than for the brothers to say it for me.

963
00:39:09,840 --> 00:39:10,560
Can we all say it?

964
00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:12,080
Can we all just say it in unison right now?

965
00:39:12,080 --> 00:39:14,320
Okay, one, two, three.

966
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:15,440
I love you.

967
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:16,000
I love you.

968
00:39:16,720 --> 00:39:18,560
However, don't worry by the time this airs

969
00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:20,560
I'll hopefully have thought of something else as well.

970
00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:21,120
Probably?

971
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:24,320
Anyway, here's to another five years together.

972
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:25,760
You better not, cause we just said it.

973
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:27,680
So if you say it now, it's gonna be weird.

974
00:39:27,680 --> 00:39:28,800
It's a bit copycat.

975
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:30,400
What if you say something better?

976
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:32,240
What if you're the one who finally discovers

977
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:34,640
something better to say than I love you?

978
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:37,760
Like discovers like the next strata.

979
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:39,200
You know what I'm talking about?

980
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:40,720
Yeah, like what's beyond that?

981
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:44,000
Like what's the umami of I love you?

982
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:46,080
What's the umami, the fifth love flavor?

983
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:48,880
What is the fifth love flavor?

984
00:39:50,640 --> 00:39:52,320
You're joining us here at Kitchen Stadium.

985
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:55,200
Um, the chef has just used the fifth love flavor.

986
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:57,920
I have another message I want to do real quick.

987
00:39:57,920 --> 00:39:59,360
It is from Mark Petrocious.

988
00:39:59,360 --> 00:40:02,240
Now people say, how do you remember these names?

989
00:40:02,240 --> 00:40:04,000
And this one I have a mnemonic device for.

990
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:05,840
It's supercalifragilistic.

991
00:40:05,840 --> 00:40:07,120
Hey, it's Mark Petrocious.

992
00:40:07,120 --> 00:40:08,160
That's how I help.

993
00:40:08,160 --> 00:40:09,200
Always remember it.

994
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:10,640
And this message is from Drew.

995
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:13,120
And it says, hey chuckle fuck.

996
00:40:13,120 --> 00:40:14,960
I figured out what better way to spend the money

997
00:40:14,960 --> 00:40:17,200
that you bet me thinking the star wars seven

998
00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:19,040
would be worse than episode one.

999
00:40:19,040 --> 00:40:22,320
Then to have your three favorite brothers let you know

1000
00:40:22,320 --> 00:40:23,520
how dumb you are.

1001
00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:24,400
Here you go.

1002
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:26,240
Your hard-earned money being used to tell you

1003
00:40:26,240 --> 00:40:27,840
how bad you fucked up.

1004
00:40:27,840 --> 00:40:28,640
Enjoy.

1005
00:40:28,640 --> 00:40:29,760
Yeah, that was a bad bet.

1006
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:31,200
And an expensive bet.

1007
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:31,920
Who does that?

1008
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:35,920
I bet you $150 that this star wars movie is gonna suck.

1009
00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:36,240
What?

1010
00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:37,360
What?

1011
00:40:37,360 --> 00:40:38,480
Guys, that's a bad bet.

1012
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:39,680
It looked amazing in the preview.

1013
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:41,520
Yeah, the trailers were like really.

1014
00:40:41,520 --> 00:40:41,840
Yeah.

1015
00:40:42,720 --> 00:40:44,720
Nobody knows when Petrocious did this.

1016
00:40:45,520 --> 00:40:48,000
Like nobody knows when he made this bet.

1017
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:49,840
Yeah, like maybe he just.

1018
00:40:49,840 --> 00:40:51,920
The records have been lost to time.

1019
00:40:51,920 --> 00:40:53,760
Did you, maybe it was early.

1020
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:56,720
Like when somebody was like, hey, did you hear the alias guy

1021
00:40:56,720 --> 00:40:59,760
is making his own star wars movie by himself?

1022
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:01,280
And he's playing all the parts.

1023
00:41:01,280 --> 00:41:01,520
Yeah.

1024
00:41:02,080 --> 00:41:03,920
Like that would have been an opportunity.

1025
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:04,720
Maybe at that point.

1026
00:41:04,720 --> 00:41:06,480
There's no lightsabers in this one.

1027
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:07,280
Isn't that weird?

1028
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:07,920
Or space.

1029
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:10,560
Apparently it's all happening under the sea.

1030
00:41:11,120 --> 00:41:13,760
It's an underwater gungan fuck fest.

1031
00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:16,320
Got one more message here.

1032
00:41:16,320 --> 00:41:17,120
Okay.

1033
00:41:17,120 --> 00:41:21,200
This one is for Ryan and it's from Thomas who says,

1034
00:41:21,200 --> 00:41:23,840
hey Ryan, even though you're an upper manager now and have all

1035
00:41:23,840 --> 00:41:25,360
these super important responsibilities,

1036
00:41:25,360 --> 00:41:27,200
I hope you have a few minutes to hear the McElroy brothers

1037
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:29,200
deliver a message from a lowly peon.

1038
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:31,200
I'm so proud to have you as my brother.

1039
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:33,760
The work you do at patch gaming helps people struggling with

1040
00:41:33,760 --> 00:41:36,320
anxiety and depression is incredibly important.

1041
00:41:36,320 --> 00:41:38,240
And you're such a great lead events coordinator.

1042
00:41:38,240 --> 00:41:41,440
However, I would appreciate it if you'd stop being so damn good

1043
00:41:41,440 --> 00:41:42,880
at Kerbal space program.

1044
00:41:42,880 --> 00:41:44,400
You make the rest of us look bad.

1045
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:45,840
I know we both have a lot on our plates,

1046
00:41:45,840 --> 00:41:48,320
but I'm glad we found the McElroy family of shows together.

1047
00:41:48,320 --> 00:41:50,000
Even if my white whale is getting you

1048
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:51,200
to listen to the adventure zone.

1049
00:41:51,200 --> 00:41:52,720
You sure it's a pretty good show.

1050
00:41:55,040 --> 00:41:58,160
Thanks for being there when I need to talk a great co-op buddy

1051
00:41:58,160 --> 00:41:59,840
and my partner in geekery.

1052
00:41:59,840 --> 00:42:01,600
I love you, Thomas.

1053
00:42:01,600 --> 00:42:02,880
That was very sweet.

1054
00:42:02,880 --> 00:42:03,600
That's sweet.

1055
00:42:03,600 --> 00:42:04,880
I don't like him that earnest though.

1056
00:42:04,880 --> 00:42:07,040
I like, like, don't you want to make fun of him for something?

1057
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:08,560
There's gotta be something.

1058
00:42:08,560 --> 00:42:10,320
He's too nice.

1059
00:42:10,320 --> 00:42:13,280
You're too good at putting together spaceships that-

1060
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:15,680
You're too good at leading events.

1061
00:42:15,680 --> 00:42:17,120
You co-ordinator.

1062
00:42:17,120 --> 00:42:18,640
You cool coordinator.

1063
00:42:18,640 --> 00:42:21,600
I just looked at the first three words I saw on the page.

1064
00:42:22,240 --> 00:42:23,760
That was not a good insult.

1065
00:42:24,640 --> 00:42:26,560
You stinking co-ordinator.

1066
00:42:28,560 --> 00:42:31,360
Ty is a pedantic person.

1067
00:42:31,360 --> 00:42:35,680
I think when he pronounces these words, it's in a very show-offy way.

1068
00:42:36,320 --> 00:42:37,120
Jairo.

1069
00:42:37,120 --> 00:42:38,000
Yiro.

1070
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:39,040
Sacrebleu.

1071
00:42:39,040 --> 00:42:40,000
Sacrebleu.

1072
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:41,040
Ayers Rock.

1073
00:42:41,040 --> 00:42:41,680
Uluru.

1074
00:42:41,680 --> 00:42:44,080
What you are witnessing is real.

1075
00:42:44,080 --> 00:42:46,320
The participants are not actors.

1076
00:42:46,320 --> 00:42:49,360
They are actual litigants with real cases.

1077
00:42:49,360 --> 00:42:55,200
They call in via Skype to Judge John Hodgman's court, the real people's court.

1078
00:42:55,200 --> 00:42:58,800
Now I call you to Judge John Hodgman's internet court.

1079
00:42:58,800 --> 00:43:02,960
Find it at Maximumfun.org or wherever you download podcasts.

1080
00:43:05,280 --> 00:43:06,080
How about a yahoo?

1081
00:43:06,080 --> 00:43:08,960
How about a cool fresh yahoo?

1082
00:43:08,960 --> 00:43:11,840
How about a cool fresh yahoo?

1083
00:43:11,840 --> 00:43:13,840
A seasonal, farm-to-market yahoo.

1084
00:43:16,160 --> 00:43:19,200
This one was sent in by level9000yajurajudevenport.

1085
00:43:19,200 --> 00:43:20,000
Thank you, Drew.

1086
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:22,480
It's by Yajuranser's user, Abby, who asks,

1087
00:43:24,480 --> 00:43:25,440
Out of cheese?

1088
00:43:27,440 --> 00:43:29,680
The local Mexican food place was out of cheese,

1089
00:43:29,680 --> 00:43:32,720
and I want to write a letter of complaint instead of being rude.

1090
00:43:32,720 --> 00:43:35,360
Any ideas of some gentle yet firm things I can say?

1091
00:43:35,360 --> 00:43:37,360
A couple of things.

1092
00:43:37,360 --> 00:43:40,800
If I worked at this Mexican restaurant and we ran out of cheese one day,

1093
00:43:40,800 --> 00:43:43,360
like I know we fucked up, there's going to be three things.

1094
00:43:43,360 --> 00:43:44,080
I know I said a couple.

1095
00:43:44,080 --> 00:43:44,720
That's the first thing.

1096
00:43:44,720 --> 00:43:46,880
The second thing is if somebody walks up to me and says,

1097
00:43:46,880 --> 00:43:48,080
hey, you fucked up, idiot.

1098
00:43:48,080 --> 00:43:49,120
There's no cheese, dummy.

1099
00:43:49,120 --> 00:43:50,720
How am I supposed to enjoy my meals?

1100
00:43:51,360 --> 00:43:55,360
I would be upset at that person, but I would be way more upset

1101
00:43:55,360 --> 00:43:57,760
if I received a letter in the mail telling me that I have

1102
00:43:57,760 --> 00:43:59,120
fucked up with the cheese problem.

1103
00:43:59,120 --> 00:44:01,600
To whom it may concern.

1104
00:44:01,600 --> 00:44:03,840
Because the insult, somebody wrote something like,

1105
00:44:03,840 --> 00:44:06,320
somebody rolls up and gets right up in your grill and is like,

1106
00:44:06,320 --> 00:44:08,720
where's the fucking cheese, please?

1107
00:44:08,720 --> 00:44:11,840
Then I would be like, ugh, I hate this interaction,

1108
00:44:11,840 --> 00:44:13,200
but it'll be over soon.

1109
00:44:13,200 --> 00:44:17,040
If I received some sort of physical, tangible artifact in the mail

1110
00:44:17,600 --> 00:44:20,240
informing me of a cheese problem that somebody had,

1111
00:44:20,240 --> 00:44:22,960
I would be sadder that that person exists.

1112
00:44:22,960 --> 00:44:25,120
Then I would be at the person who comes and yells at my face.

1113
00:44:25,120 --> 00:44:26,640
I just picture Griffin in that circumstance,

1114
00:44:26,640 --> 00:44:29,440
sitting down at his desk, and he's both looking at the letter

1115
00:44:29,440 --> 00:44:32,400
and also the cheese order for me forgot to send.

1116
00:44:32,400 --> 00:44:35,040
And he's just looking back and forth between the two of them

1117
00:44:35,040 --> 00:44:36,320
and sobbing uncontrollably.

1118
00:44:36,320 --> 00:44:38,880
Just sobbing, ugh, I really fucked up.

1119
00:44:38,880 --> 00:44:41,120
I fucked up the whole cheese situation.

1120
00:44:41,120 --> 00:44:42,640
The whole cheese thing.

1121
00:44:43,120 --> 00:44:45,680
I did cheese bad from start to finish.

1122
00:44:47,680 --> 00:44:50,480
The third thing is just fuck you, man, come on.

1123
00:44:50,480 --> 00:44:53,840
You don't think they, come on, they know.

1124
00:44:53,840 --> 00:44:57,280
They weren't expecting such a run on cheese, you know?

1125
00:44:57,280 --> 00:45:00,160
They thought they had enough cheese for the lunch rush,

1126
00:45:00,160 --> 00:45:04,000
and then they had like eight people all come in at the same time

1127
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:06,560
and just ask for a big bowl of cheese.

1128
00:45:06,560 --> 00:45:08,080
They weren't expecting it.

1129
00:45:08,080 --> 00:45:09,200
It wasn't their fault.

1130
00:45:09,920 --> 00:45:12,240
You know, sometimes you just run out of cheese.

1131
00:45:12,240 --> 00:45:13,680
That's what being an adult is.

1132
00:45:13,680 --> 00:45:16,400
Sometimes being an adult is accepting that there's not always cheese

1133
00:45:16,400 --> 00:45:18,160
when you want it, and you have to make do.

1134
00:45:18,160 --> 00:45:21,120
Maybe you get sour cream or you get extra avocado, whatever.

1135
00:45:21,120 --> 00:45:23,840
But you have to accept that there's not always cheese when you want it.

1136
00:45:23,840 --> 00:45:25,280
The world's not perfect.

1137
00:45:25,280 --> 00:45:27,440
Did you even stop to see if they had milk?

1138
00:45:27,440 --> 00:45:28,640
Because if they have milk,

1139
00:45:28,640 --> 00:45:31,920
because if they have milk and thyme, you got cheese, my friend.

1140
00:45:31,920 --> 00:45:34,800
Dog, if they got milk and salt and a hairdryer,

1141
00:45:34,800 --> 00:45:36,080
you got cheese there, dude.

1142
00:45:36,640 --> 00:45:39,200
Did you offer to go get more cheese for them?

1143
00:45:39,200 --> 00:45:42,000
Like, I'll go on a cheese run, just kick me like a 20,

1144
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:43,920
and I'll bring you guys back some cheese

1145
00:45:43,920 --> 00:45:46,720
because we're all in this fucking thing together.

1146
00:45:46,720 --> 00:45:48,560
This big dumb world is still spinning,

1147
00:45:48,560 --> 00:45:50,400
all of us are just hanging on for dear life.

1148
00:45:50,400 --> 00:45:53,680
I'll go get you some CHWSE, my boy.

1149
00:45:53,680 --> 00:45:55,120
And what you didn't pay attention to

1150
00:45:55,120 --> 00:45:58,240
is maybe they're cheese ordering guys having a really tough time.

1151
00:45:58,240 --> 00:46:00,720
Maybe like he and his wife got in a fight before he came to work

1152
00:46:00,720 --> 00:46:02,320
and forgot to pick up cheese on the way.

1153
00:46:02,320 --> 00:46:05,360
But here's you in your little cheese-centric world,

1154
00:46:05,360 --> 00:46:07,280
not even worried about his feelings.

1155
00:46:07,280 --> 00:46:10,000
Maybe it was weird cheese that looked more like butter

1156
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:11,520
and you just thought it was butter though.

1157
00:46:11,520 --> 00:46:13,920
Yeah, we all made that mistake at fancy restaurants.

1158
00:46:13,920 --> 00:46:16,960
Maybe he had cheese, but he thought it wasn't good enough for you

1159
00:46:16,960 --> 00:46:18,320
and he wanted to protect you.

1160
00:46:18,960 --> 00:46:20,960
Can I also ask fancy restaurants super quick,

1161
00:46:21,600 --> 00:46:24,960
please stop bringing scoops of white to the table

1162
00:46:24,960 --> 00:46:28,160
and expecting me to know if they have cheese or butter.

1163
00:46:28,160 --> 00:46:33,200
Or cream or ice, very small ice cream or mothballs

1164
00:46:33,200 --> 00:46:35,200
because you made a very big mistake.

1165
00:46:35,200 --> 00:46:39,200
Yeah, or just like some sort of fun ball like a toy, like a game.

1166
00:46:39,200 --> 00:46:41,280
Like it's going to be a while before we can get our food out to you.

1167
00:46:41,280 --> 00:46:43,040
So play with this small white ball.

1168
00:46:43,040 --> 00:46:44,080
Like a Cracker Barrel?

1169
00:46:44,880 --> 00:46:45,120
Yeah.

1170
00:46:47,280 --> 00:46:49,440
I want to read this response from Mary's Mama who says,

1171
00:46:49,440 --> 00:46:52,080
we have many fast food places near us where we live.

1172
00:46:52,080 --> 00:46:52,880
During the lunchtime rush,

1173
00:46:52,880 --> 00:46:55,280
it's not uncommon for soap and toilet paper to run out in the breastrooms.

1174
00:46:55,280 --> 00:46:57,360
Food items to be made wrong by poorly trained new employees

1175
00:46:57,360 --> 00:46:58,800
and other mistakes of all kinds happening,

1176
00:46:58,800 --> 00:47:00,880
including ingredients not being available.

1177
00:47:00,880 --> 00:47:02,560
If this is a first time occurrence,

1178
00:47:02,560 --> 00:47:05,680
tell them, let them apologize and then let it go.

1179
00:47:05,680 --> 00:47:07,920
There's a proverb, once is happenstance,

1180
00:47:07,920 --> 00:47:11,360
twice is coincidence and three times may be enemy action.

1181
00:47:11,360 --> 00:47:12,880
So adjust your attitude,

1182
00:47:12,880 --> 00:47:14,560
give them one more chance to do things right

1183
00:47:14,560 --> 00:47:17,040
and if they screw up after that, don't go there anymore.

1184
00:47:17,680 --> 00:47:20,080
Hold on, is this person saying that the third time

1185
00:47:20,080 --> 00:47:22,080
this fast food restaurant hates you?

1186
00:47:22,080 --> 00:47:23,520
Yo, fuck you, Derek.

1187
00:47:23,520 --> 00:47:27,120
No cheese, no cheese for you, no cheese for you, Seinfeld.

1188
00:47:27,120 --> 00:47:31,040
Joe, if this is a first time occurrence,

1189
00:47:31,040 --> 00:47:32,880
tell them and let them apologize.

1190
00:47:32,880 --> 00:47:37,520
Hey, you ran out of, you should have cheese.

1191
00:47:38,240 --> 00:47:40,000
Oh yeah, we're sorry.

1192
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:41,600
But you don't have cheese.

1193
00:47:41,600 --> 00:47:42,320
Did you know this?

1194
00:47:43,920 --> 00:47:45,360
But they say let them apologize.

1195
00:47:45,360 --> 00:47:49,600
I was like, listen, I wanted to say to you,

1196
00:47:49,600 --> 00:47:50,720
you ran out of cheese.

1197
00:47:50,720 --> 00:47:54,320
Now, do you have anything you would like to say to me?

1198
00:47:54,320 --> 00:47:57,200
How do you possibly sound sincere apologizing

1199
00:47:57,200 --> 00:47:58,720
for running out of cheese?

1200
00:47:58,720 --> 00:47:59,920
Yeah, I don't know.

1201
00:48:00,800 --> 00:48:01,920
Thank you for your time.

1202
00:48:01,920 --> 00:48:03,680
I will take my answer off the air.

1203
00:48:04,960 --> 00:48:07,440
And then you close your eyes and just wait.

1204
00:48:08,160 --> 00:48:12,080
When I worked in food service at the country's best yogurt,

1205
00:48:12,080 --> 00:48:14,240
we ran out of a yogurt flavor

1206
00:48:15,440 --> 00:48:17,760
and if somebody had come up to me and been like,

1207
00:48:17,760 --> 00:48:20,080
you'd no longer have cinnamon swirl.

1208
00:48:20,080 --> 00:48:22,480
I would say, I know this.

1209
00:48:22,480 --> 00:48:24,320
Like, why do you know?

1210
00:48:24,320 --> 00:48:26,400
Like if somebody walked up to me and was like,

1211
00:48:26,400 --> 00:48:27,840
you're really, really high

1212
00:48:27,840 --> 00:48:30,160
and you're just touching the cones with your bare hands

1213
00:48:30,160 --> 00:48:31,920
because you forgot to put gloves on.

1214
00:48:31,920 --> 00:48:33,280
Yeah, I know.

1215
00:48:35,120 --> 00:48:35,840
I know this.

1216
00:48:36,800 --> 00:48:38,640
I also get a kick out of like,

1217
00:48:38,640 --> 00:48:41,120
as somebody who has worked in many, many retail jobs

1218
00:48:41,120 --> 00:48:44,000
and a few food service jobs,

1219
00:48:44,640 --> 00:48:47,120
I get a kick out of like people who don't realize

1220
00:48:47,120 --> 00:48:51,200
exactly how low on the supply chain

1221
00:48:51,200 --> 00:48:53,520
you actually are.

1222
00:48:53,520 --> 00:48:55,920
If you were like talking to somebody at a restaurant,

1223
00:48:55,920 --> 00:48:59,280
like the idea that they could have in any way

1224
00:48:59,280 --> 00:49:03,120
predicted or circumvented the issue of the cheese

1225
00:49:03,120 --> 00:49:04,400
is baffling to me.

1226
00:49:04,400 --> 00:49:06,960
Like they don't know how the cheese gets there.

1227
00:49:06,960 --> 00:49:09,520
They don't know where the cheese comes from before then.

1228
00:49:09,520 --> 00:49:10,880
They know there's a place they open up

1229
00:49:10,880 --> 00:49:12,240
and sometimes there's cheese

1230
00:49:12,240 --> 00:49:14,160
and sometimes there aren't cheese.

1231
00:49:14,160 --> 00:49:17,040
Like that's as high up on the chain as they go.

1232
00:49:17,040 --> 00:49:18,480
When I worked at Best Buy,

1233
00:49:18,480 --> 00:49:20,400
there were numerous times where a truck would come in

1234
00:49:20,400 --> 00:49:22,400
and be like, well, we didn't get any wheeze,

1235
00:49:22,400 --> 00:49:23,840
which we're still sold out of,

1236
00:49:23,840 --> 00:49:26,400
but for some reason we got like 20 Furbys.

1237
00:49:26,400 --> 00:49:27,760
So that's great.

1238
00:49:27,760 --> 00:49:29,440
And then we'll just add that to the pile.

1239
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:31,760
Yeah, you have no idea.

1240
00:49:31,760 --> 00:49:33,200
You're one step up from the customer.

1241
00:49:33,760 --> 00:49:35,680
Listen, if you want to come back here behind the counter

1242
00:49:35,680 --> 00:49:37,280
and look for cheese, you're more than welcome to.

1243
00:49:37,280 --> 00:49:38,320
Because that's all I'd do.

1244
00:49:38,320 --> 00:49:40,240
So what you do is if someone complains about the cheese,

1245
00:49:40,240 --> 00:49:41,520
you go, come with me.

1246
00:49:41,520 --> 00:49:43,680
And then you find the next person up on the chain

1247
00:49:43,680 --> 00:49:45,760
and you're like, did you know we were out of cheese?

1248
00:49:45,760 --> 00:49:47,360
And then you just keep moving up the chain

1249
00:49:47,360 --> 00:49:49,200
until you find the cheese magnate

1250
00:49:49,200 --> 00:49:50,720
who's just sitting on a pile of cheese,

1251
00:49:50,720 --> 00:49:51,600
not letting it out.

1252
00:49:51,600 --> 00:49:53,840
Like the beers, they're just building up,

1253
00:49:53,840 --> 00:49:56,240
you know, supply and demand on their cheese.

1254
00:49:56,240 --> 00:49:59,280
And you yell at them really hard.

1255
00:49:59,280 --> 00:50:02,160
I'm glad we all agree that you have to yell at somebody.

1256
00:50:02,160 --> 00:50:02,660
Yeah.

1257
00:50:03,680 --> 00:50:06,160
You can't just accept that there's no cheese.

1258
00:50:06,880 --> 00:50:07,840
Oh, for sure.

1259
00:50:07,840 --> 00:50:10,560
No, this is, well, I don't know where this question came from,

1260
00:50:10,560 --> 00:50:12,160
but I'm in America.

1261
00:50:12,160 --> 00:50:12,660
Yeah.

1262
00:50:13,440 --> 00:50:14,800
Cheese is my right.

1263
00:50:14,800 --> 00:50:16,880
I ride my bike to and from work every day,

1264
00:50:16,880 --> 00:50:19,280
although listen to the brothers McElroy, that's us.

1265
00:50:20,080 --> 00:50:20,580
Hopefully.

1266
00:50:21,920 --> 00:50:22,400
Yeah.

1267
00:50:22,400 --> 00:50:24,800
We haven't, oh God, TM, TM, TM.

1268
00:50:24,800 --> 00:50:25,760
TM, TM, TM, the whole-

1269
00:50:25,760 --> 00:50:27,360
Why have we sat on this so long?

1270
00:50:27,360 --> 00:50:29,200
For six years, TM on six years.

1271
00:50:30,480 --> 00:50:33,120
The time, it cannot protect me from my greatest enemy.

1272
00:50:33,120 --> 00:50:35,280
This passes the time,

1273
00:50:35,280 --> 00:50:37,120
it cannot protect me from my greatest enemy.

1274
00:50:37,120 --> 00:50:39,360
On my way to work, I ride by a small pond

1275
00:50:39,360 --> 00:50:41,680
that is home to a particularly rude-

1276
00:50:41,680 --> 00:50:43,120
A perfectly rude family.

1277
00:50:43,120 --> 00:50:45,280
Perfectly rude family of geese.

1278
00:50:45,280 --> 00:50:47,840
They recently just had babies,

1279
00:50:47,840 --> 00:50:49,920
and although I respect their life choices,

1280
00:50:49,920 --> 00:50:52,560
the parents have become very defensive.

1281
00:50:52,560 --> 00:50:55,040
One goose has taken a flying after me as I ride away

1282
00:50:55,040 --> 00:50:56,000
as fast as I can.

1283
00:50:56,560 --> 00:50:58,480
I'm afraid they're going to bite my legs off,

1284
00:50:58,480 --> 00:50:59,520
and I need your help.

1285
00:51:00,160 --> 00:51:02,880
How can I learn to coexist with my feathered friends?

1286
00:51:03,520 --> 00:51:06,800
That's from wishing I could fly away home in Wisconsin.

1287
00:51:07,840 --> 00:51:12,960
We have had a, let's call it tumultuous,

1288
00:51:12,960 --> 00:51:16,480
confusing relationship with geesees

1289
00:51:17,040 --> 00:51:19,200
in the past, in the history of this show.

1290
00:51:19,200 --> 00:51:20,560
I feel like we've oscillated between,

1291
00:51:21,200 --> 00:51:24,080
they are modern day velociraptors,

1292
00:51:24,640 --> 00:51:26,000
would love to fuck one of them guys,

1293
00:51:27,120 --> 00:51:28,720
and then back to the velociraptor thing,

1294
00:51:28,720 --> 00:51:30,160
and I feel like that's where we're at now,

1295
00:51:30,160 --> 00:51:34,000
and I think maybe it's 2016, 2016, building bridges.

1296
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:35,360
I feel like maybe we need to build a bridge

1297
00:51:35,360 --> 00:51:36,480
to the goose community,

1298
00:51:36,480 --> 00:51:39,840
and let's just really role play it, just real quick.

1299
00:51:39,840 --> 00:51:44,880
A goose-based advice podcast for geese by geese.

1300
00:51:44,880 --> 00:51:47,520
We are geese doing a goose-based podcast.

1301
00:51:47,520 --> 00:51:48,960
I feel like this is going to help enlighten it.

1302
00:51:48,960 --> 00:51:50,880
And this question, hi everybody, I'm Griffin McElroy,

1303
00:51:50,880 --> 00:51:52,960
I'm a goose, and you're a goose when you're listening to this.

1304
00:51:52,960 --> 00:51:55,280
This question comes from a goose from Wisconsin,

1305
00:51:55,280 --> 00:51:58,720
and it says, shitty kids come up and kick me all the time,

1306
00:51:58,720 --> 00:52:00,560
and they kick my kids for no reason

1307
00:52:00,560 --> 00:52:02,880
because human beings are the worst,

1308
00:52:02,880 --> 00:52:05,760
and they don't even think about goose feelings

1309
00:52:05,760 --> 00:52:07,360
when they just kick the shit out of us,

1310
00:52:07,360 --> 00:52:08,400
so what should I do?

1311
00:52:08,400 --> 00:52:10,080
Well, thanks for sitting in Wisconsin,

1312
00:52:10,080 --> 00:52:11,040
thanks for this question.

1313
00:52:11,040 --> 00:52:12,080
You need to be very defensive,

1314
00:52:12,080 --> 00:52:13,680
and you need to just attack first,

1315
00:52:13,680 --> 00:52:15,520
because we're just geese out here just trying to get along,

1316
00:52:15,520 --> 00:52:16,320
and we're just trying to survive,

1317
00:52:16,320 --> 00:52:17,920
so just bite, bite, bite, quack, quack, quack,

1318
00:52:17,920 --> 00:52:19,760
get out there, fly at them, attack them.

1319
00:52:19,760 --> 00:52:21,520
Yeah, because you think about it,

1320
00:52:21,520 --> 00:52:25,440
like if you got attacked by one goose,

1321
00:52:25,440 --> 00:52:27,760
like every time this goose fucked you up,

1322
00:52:27,760 --> 00:52:29,120
it's the same goose every time,

1323
00:52:29,120 --> 00:52:31,440
the next time you ran into a goose,

1324
00:52:31,440 --> 00:52:32,800
you wouldn't differentiate.

1325
00:52:32,800 --> 00:52:34,560
If someone's like, I'm going to go pet that motherfucker,

1326
00:52:34,560 --> 00:52:35,360
you'd be like, don't.

1327
00:52:35,360 --> 00:52:36,160
Don't do that, actually.

1328
00:52:36,160 --> 00:52:38,000
Geese is, don't do that.

1329
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:40,880
No, they bite, they bite your legs off.

1330
00:52:40,880 --> 00:52:42,720
Let me just, here's what you need.

1331
00:52:42,720 --> 00:52:44,000
You need to build a bridge here.

1332
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:45,600
I think Gervin's absolutely right.

1333
00:52:45,600 --> 00:52:47,040
Yeah, build a bridge over their nest,

1334
00:52:47,040 --> 00:52:49,120
so that way you don't have to interact with that water.

1335
00:52:49,120 --> 00:52:52,640
I think that, okay, if this were a movie, right,

1336
00:52:52,640 --> 00:52:55,360
and this was like, there's a damaged animal,

1337
00:52:55,360 --> 00:52:57,840
you know, cagey, defensive animal,

1338
00:52:57,840 --> 00:53:00,000
and you're going to do like a little horse whisper thing,

1339
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:02,880
do a little goose whispering, you're going to like.

1340
00:53:02,880 --> 00:53:06,640
Without a sexual agenda appended to it.

1341
00:53:06,640 --> 00:53:07,920
No, because they'll know.

1342
00:53:07,920 --> 00:53:11,760
Like, when you get close, maybe like, park your bike,

1343
00:53:11,760 --> 00:53:13,040
and like, you're just going to sit.

1344
00:53:13,680 --> 00:53:17,120
But within like, visual range of the goose,

1345
00:53:17,120 --> 00:53:19,760
but not close enough that they feel threatened.

1346
00:53:19,760 --> 00:53:22,320
And then the next day, you're going to do it a little closer.

1347
00:53:22,320 --> 00:53:24,880
And then the next day, now this might take years.

1348
00:53:24,880 --> 00:53:25,440
Yeah.

1349
00:53:25,440 --> 00:53:28,400
But eventually, you'll be right next to them.

1350
00:53:28,400 --> 00:53:28,800
Are you going to feed the geese?

1351
00:53:28,800 --> 00:53:31,680
And you'll be like Jane Goodall, all up in that shit.

1352
00:53:31,680 --> 00:53:34,640
You'll be Jane Goosall, you'll be right there.

1353
00:53:34,640 --> 00:53:35,760
Are you going to try and feed these?

1354
00:53:35,760 --> 00:53:37,280
Are you going to try and feed these sweet feathered beasts?

1355
00:53:37,280 --> 00:53:39,680
No, you're going to join their herd?

1356
00:53:39,680 --> 00:53:41,520
I see, no bribery then.

1357
00:53:42,400 --> 00:53:43,040
Unless.

1358
00:53:43,040 --> 00:53:43,680
Unless.

1359
00:53:43,680 --> 00:53:47,360
Unless what you are proposing right there

1360
00:53:47,920 --> 00:53:51,600
is teaching them to trust humans.

1361
00:53:51,600 --> 00:53:53,440
Which you don't want to do.

1362
00:53:53,440 --> 00:53:54,880
I cannot stress this enough.

1363
00:53:54,880 --> 00:53:55,520
You don't want to do.

1364
00:53:55,520 --> 00:53:56,480
Let me amend it then.

1365
00:53:57,040 --> 00:53:58,960
Let me propose an alternate plan.

1366
00:53:58,960 --> 00:53:59,200
Okay.

1367
00:54:00,080 --> 00:54:01,760
Every day, you roll up to the geese,

1368
00:54:02,560 --> 00:54:06,000
and you toss them a bo staff, and you're like, how about thee?

1369
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:08,000
And every day, you fight the geese.

1370
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:10,240
And that teaches them to, one, be defensive of humans,

1371
00:54:10,240 --> 00:54:12,160
but it also teaches them our weaknesses.

1372
00:54:12,160 --> 00:54:15,120
So I'm saying every day, you attack the geese full blast

1373
00:54:15,120 --> 00:54:16,080
for like 30 seconds.

1374
00:54:16,080 --> 00:54:17,280
Do you think there'll come a time

1375
00:54:17,280 --> 00:54:20,080
where they respect you as a combatant?

1376
00:54:20,080 --> 00:54:22,880
At first, you're going to kick their asses.

1377
00:54:22,880 --> 00:54:25,280
But if you do it enough days, they live,

1378
00:54:25,840 --> 00:54:26,640
you're going to-

1379
00:54:26,640 --> 00:54:29,760
Wait, wait, wait, wait, because there's a caveat in there

1380
00:54:29,760 --> 00:54:32,080
that much like Eurovision at the beginning of the podcast,

1381
00:54:32,080 --> 00:54:33,520
you kind of tried to gloss right over.

1382
00:54:34,080 --> 00:54:35,760
Well, it's not the most important thing.

1383
00:54:35,760 --> 00:54:36,560
The most important thing is that

1384
00:54:36,560 --> 00:54:38,160
they're going to start to learn your weaknesses.

1385
00:54:38,160 --> 00:54:40,240
They're going to start to learn your attack patterns.

1386
00:54:40,240 --> 00:54:40,880
Wait, hold on.

1387
00:54:40,880 --> 00:54:42,800
Do you pull your hits, Justin, or do you-

1388
00:54:42,800 --> 00:54:43,600
Absolutely not.

1389
00:54:43,600 --> 00:54:44,800
I can't stress it enough.

1390
00:54:44,800 --> 00:54:46,640
You got to go full blast at this goose.

1391
00:54:46,640 --> 00:54:47,760
Give them everything you got,

1392
00:54:47,760 --> 00:54:50,080
because that's what those shitty kids are going to be doing.

1393
00:54:50,080 --> 00:54:50,400
Right.

1394
00:54:50,400 --> 00:54:52,880
But if they can learn to defend themselves from you,

1395
00:54:52,880 --> 00:54:53,680
they're going to be ready.

1396
00:54:53,680 --> 00:54:54,960
When those shitty kids come,

1397
00:54:54,960 --> 00:54:57,440
they're going to be flipping over them.

1398
00:54:57,440 --> 00:54:59,840
They're going to be doing some sort of feather blast.

1399
00:54:59,840 --> 00:55:03,360
I love this, because I was going to amend it to say,

1400
00:55:03,360 --> 00:55:05,120
just like a Panda documentary I watch,

1401
00:55:05,120 --> 00:55:06,720
what you have to do is dress like a goose

1402
00:55:06,720 --> 00:55:09,760
and smear like goose poop and pee all over yourself,

1403
00:55:09,760 --> 00:55:11,600
so that you smell like one of them.

1404
00:55:11,600 --> 00:55:12,880
But what you're proposing is,

1405
00:55:12,880 --> 00:55:16,080
what I would say is the polar opposite of that,

1406
00:55:16,080 --> 00:55:19,600
where instead you're engaging them in the field of combat.

1407
00:55:19,600 --> 00:55:19,840
Right.

1408
00:55:19,840 --> 00:55:20,960
Travis, you're approaching it from

1409
00:55:21,520 --> 00:55:23,680
an upsettingly humanist perspective.

1410
00:55:23,680 --> 00:55:26,080
And I feel like this question asker is also

1411
00:55:26,080 --> 00:55:29,120
engaging this topic with the same perspective of just like,

1412
00:55:29,840 --> 00:55:32,560
there's an animal that doesn't inherently like me.

1413
00:55:32,560 --> 00:55:34,320
Yeah, like that's fine.

1414
00:55:34,320 --> 00:55:36,240
I think that's fine that some animals are like that,

1415
00:55:36,240 --> 00:55:38,320
because we're definitely like that to like,

1416
00:55:38,320 --> 00:55:41,280
anything that we can eat, but-

1417
00:55:41,280 --> 00:55:43,680
Yeah, like Justin, you're only not like that to them,

1418
00:55:43,680 --> 00:55:45,280
because you don't want to eat them today.

1419
00:55:45,280 --> 00:55:45,600
Right.

1420
00:55:45,600 --> 00:55:50,160
Like, what Justin is suggesting is that

1421
00:55:50,160 --> 00:55:52,560
we enforce the habits that they already have.

1422
00:55:53,440 --> 00:55:55,440
And because I think that's a healthy habit

1423
00:55:55,440 --> 00:55:56,640
for some animals to have.

1424
00:55:56,640 --> 00:56:03,120
Like I'm okay that geese are little feathered hate boats,

1425
00:56:03,120 --> 00:56:04,880
essentially flying hate boats.

1426
00:56:04,880 --> 00:56:07,280
Like I'm okay with that because like, that's fine.

1427
00:56:07,280 --> 00:56:09,200
There should be some animals like that.

1428
00:56:09,200 --> 00:56:10,320
I'm comfortable with that.

1429
00:56:10,320 --> 00:56:12,800
And like kids are going to come shoot bottle rockets at you.

1430
00:56:12,800 --> 00:56:14,480
So Justin's going to do it first

1431
00:56:14,480 --> 00:56:15,680
to train you how to dodge the bottle rockets.

1432
00:56:15,680 --> 00:56:16,880
He's going to toughen you up.

1433
00:56:20,160 --> 00:56:21,200
So I hope that helps.

1434
00:56:21,840 --> 00:56:23,280
The geese, play this for the geese.

1435
00:56:23,280 --> 00:56:25,600
Can we get this information out to the geese somehow?

1436
00:56:25,600 --> 00:56:26,000
Can we get this to geese?

1437
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:27,040
That's mutually beneficial,

1438
00:56:27,040 --> 00:56:28,720
because that's a whole new demographic for us

1439
00:56:28,720 --> 00:56:31,200
that is an untapped market as far as I know.

1440
00:56:31,200 --> 00:56:33,920
Would you guys, how hard would you guys,

1441
00:56:33,920 --> 00:56:36,240
if you guys were on iTunes and you saw a podcast,

1442
00:56:36,240 --> 00:56:39,360
it's like for geese only, how to fight humans.

1443
00:56:39,360 --> 00:56:40,880
Like I would so listen to that.

1444
00:56:40,880 --> 00:56:42,240
But you're not allowed to Justin.

1445
00:56:42,240 --> 00:56:44,480
I'd be breaking, well, it'd be all quacks and shit.

1446
00:56:45,040 --> 00:56:46,720
Well, no, you would learn like how to,

1447
00:56:46,720 --> 00:56:50,320
you would learn how to better kick a goose's ass.

1448
00:56:50,320 --> 00:56:52,480
And that's not what we want to put out there for humans.

1449
00:56:52,480 --> 00:56:54,400
We're already super duper good at it.

1450
00:56:56,400 --> 00:56:57,840
There's going to be a war one day.

1451
00:56:58,640 --> 00:57:00,400
Yeah, between geese and humans.

1452
00:57:00,400 --> 00:57:03,760
And I don't, I want it to be, I want us to win.

1453
00:57:03,760 --> 00:57:05,920
I'm not a fucking species traitor,

1454
00:57:05,920 --> 00:57:08,480
but I do want them to be able to put up a fair fight.

1455
00:57:08,480 --> 00:57:10,560
Yeah, you don't want to feel bad about winning.

1456
00:57:10,560 --> 00:57:12,560
I would love for it to end in like a stalemate,

1457
00:57:12,560 --> 00:57:13,920
lots of losses on both sides,

1458
00:57:13,920 --> 00:57:15,840
where both of us like pull through,

1459
00:57:16,640 --> 00:57:19,040
but there's like a begrudging respect is earned.

1460
00:57:20,160 --> 00:57:21,840
And then there's one Christmas day

1461
00:57:21,840 --> 00:57:24,240
where us and the geese all play soccer together.

1462
00:57:24,240 --> 00:57:26,480
And then yeah, I would love to play soccer with the geese.

1463
00:57:27,520 --> 00:57:28,640
I would do that in a heartbeat.

1464
00:57:28,640 --> 00:57:29,840
That's going to do it for us folks.

1465
00:57:29,840 --> 00:57:31,200
Thank you so much for listening to our show.

1466
00:57:31,200 --> 00:57:33,200
We hope you had a lot of fun

1467
00:57:33,200 --> 00:57:34,800
and a lot of laughs and frivolity.

1468
00:57:35,680 --> 00:57:36,880
We certainly enjoyed ourselves.

1469
00:57:37,840 --> 00:57:39,120
Thank you to everybody who bought tickets

1470
00:57:39,120 --> 00:57:41,200
to see us in New York and DC.

1471
00:57:41,200 --> 00:57:43,360
Those tickets sold out a day of.

1472
00:57:43,360 --> 00:57:47,680
I think there may be a few single tickets for DC,

1473
00:57:47,680 --> 00:57:50,400
but they sent out a super low ticket warning.

1474
00:57:50,400 --> 00:57:52,560
So it's possible that by the time this goes up,

1475
00:57:52,560 --> 00:57:53,440
they are gone.

1476
00:57:53,440 --> 00:57:54,800
We learned last time we came to New York

1477
00:57:54,800 --> 00:57:56,640
and did a theater that was like a hundred seats

1478
00:57:56,640 --> 00:57:59,280
and it sold out like in 45 seconds.

1479
00:57:59,280 --> 00:58:00,560
And we knew we fucked up instantly.

1480
00:58:00,560 --> 00:58:03,280
Like we knew that it was going to sell really well there,

1481
00:58:03,280 --> 00:58:06,160
but you guys like blew us the fuck away.

1482
00:58:06,160 --> 00:58:08,320
Like, thank you so much.

1483
00:58:08,320 --> 00:58:10,640
I hope we put on a show that is good enough

1484
00:58:10,640 --> 00:58:14,800
to like warrant the insane enthusiasm you guys.

1485
00:58:14,800 --> 00:58:17,920
So yeah, it looks like DC as we're recording this,

1486
00:58:17,920 --> 00:58:20,480
you could still get some singles to DC.

1487
00:58:21,200 --> 00:58:22,720
I don't know if you could get pairs to,

1488
00:58:22,720 --> 00:58:24,640
yeah, well, it looks like you could get pairs together.

1489
00:58:24,640 --> 00:58:25,840
Yeah, go, go quick.

1490
00:58:26,480 --> 00:58:27,360
Those are not sold out.

1491
00:58:27,360 --> 00:58:29,520
New York is sold out, I'm pretty sure.

1492
00:58:29,520 --> 00:58:32,160
There's always a chance that, you know,

1493
00:58:32,160 --> 00:58:34,000
there's resale tickets in New York

1494
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:36,240
or that there's maybe a waiting list.

1495
00:58:36,240 --> 00:58:37,200
But I'm going to tell you the same thing

1496
00:58:37,200 --> 00:58:38,640
that we say every time,

1497
00:58:38,640 --> 00:58:41,360
which is there's always a chance that you show up day of

1498
00:58:41,360 --> 00:58:43,440
and you're able to get in last minute

1499
00:58:43,440 --> 00:58:44,560
because people don't show up,

1500
00:58:44,560 --> 00:58:47,280
but there is absolutely no guarantee of that.

1501
00:58:47,280 --> 00:58:49,280
And we would like to encourage people to do that.

1502
00:58:49,280 --> 00:58:50,480
And then they're not able to get in.

1503
00:58:50,480 --> 00:58:52,720
We know like if you don't live in Manhattan,

1504
00:58:52,720 --> 00:58:54,080
like it can be tough to get down there.

1505
00:58:54,080 --> 00:58:57,200
So like, we really don't want you to spend an hour on a train

1506
00:58:57,200 --> 00:58:59,040
like coming to our show and then not be able to get in.

1507
00:59:00,240 --> 00:59:01,120
So, we don't know.

1508
00:59:01,120 --> 00:59:02,240
But in case you're wondering,

1509
00:59:02,240 --> 00:59:04,320
that usually is a thing that you're able to do,

1510
00:59:04,320 --> 00:59:05,920
but no guarantees.

1511
00:59:07,280 --> 00:59:07,780
Okay.

1512
00:59:09,120 --> 00:59:10,720
We want to encourage everybody to go check out

1513
00:59:10,720 --> 00:59:14,080
all the other amazing Maximum Fun shows at MaximumFun.org.

1514
00:59:14,640 --> 00:59:16,640
A lot of them are McElroy related,

1515
00:59:16,640 --> 00:59:19,520
but even the ones who aren't are really, really great.

1516
00:59:19,520 --> 00:59:21,680
We just added a new one called,

1517
00:59:21,680 --> 00:59:23,760
I believe it's called The Greatest Generation

1518
00:59:23,760 --> 00:59:26,720
for people who have maybe just started watching Star Trek

1519
00:59:26,720 --> 00:59:29,680
or love Star Trek and feel that they're a little too old for it,

1520
00:59:29,680 --> 00:59:30,320
which is silly.

1521
00:59:30,320 --> 00:59:31,040
It's for everybody.

1522
00:59:31,040 --> 00:59:31,840
It's really great.

1523
00:59:31,840 --> 00:59:34,880
So listen to the podcast and feel included and feel involved

1524
00:59:34,880 --> 00:59:37,040
and maybe learn a little bit about Star Trek.

1525
00:59:37,040 --> 00:59:37,920
We also want to,

1526
00:59:37,920 --> 00:59:40,720
if you want to learn all about every McElroy project

1527
00:59:40,720 --> 00:59:42,160
that is out there in the world,

1528
00:59:42,160 --> 00:59:44,320
you can go to McElroyShows.com.

1529
00:59:45,040 --> 00:59:46,240
All our shows are on there.

1530
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:50,480
And also our Twitter accounts, Facebook groups,

1531
00:59:51,360 --> 00:59:52,720
and contact information.

1532
00:59:52,720 --> 00:59:54,720
So if you're looking to send in questions

1533
00:59:54,720 --> 00:59:56,800
or mail something to us, it's all right there.

1534
00:59:56,800 --> 00:59:59,440
I also want to mention that John Hodgman

1535
00:59:59,440 --> 01:00:02,000
is doing a bunch of live shows for Judge John Hodgman.

1536
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:04,320
It's another amazing Max Fun podcast

1537
01:00:04,320 --> 01:00:05,360
that you should definitely be listening to,

1538
01:00:05,360 --> 01:00:09,040
but he's coming to DC and Philadelphia and Brooklyn

1539
01:00:09,040 --> 01:00:10,640
and Turner Falls.

1540
01:00:11,520 --> 01:00:13,600
You can find out how to get tickets for those

1541
01:00:13,600 --> 01:00:15,200
at MaximumFun.org too.

1542
01:00:15,200 --> 01:00:17,120
You should definitely go see that show.

1543
01:00:17,120 --> 01:00:18,240
It's going to be very, very funny.

1544
01:00:18,240 --> 01:00:20,560
Also, I want to say we know that it took us a long time

1545
01:00:20,560 --> 01:00:22,800
to schedule a live show for 2016.

1546
01:00:22,800 --> 01:00:24,560
We didn't have one in the first half of the year.

1547
01:00:24,560 --> 01:00:28,160
We're going to try to do more as we move forward.

1548
01:00:28,160 --> 01:00:30,960
So we'll try to knock some more out in 2016

1549
01:00:30,960 --> 01:00:32,800
and maybe do some more in 2017.

1550
01:00:32,800 --> 01:00:34,560
It's just a little bit hard to get them together,

1551
01:00:34,560 --> 01:00:36,240
but we know that it's kind of a bummer

1552
01:00:36,240 --> 01:00:37,600
that it took us so long to get to one

1553
01:00:37,600 --> 01:00:39,120
and we'll do more this year, we promise.

1554
01:00:40,400 --> 01:00:42,000
And if you want to keep track of that,

1555
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:44,320
make sure to follow us on Twitter at NBNBAM

1556
01:00:44,320 --> 01:00:45,360
and keep listening to the show.

1557
01:00:46,560 --> 01:00:48,160
I want to thank John Roderick and The Long Winters

1558
01:00:48,160 --> 01:00:48,960
for the use of our theme song

1559
01:00:48,960 --> 01:00:49,760
instead of Parcher off the album,

1560
01:00:49,760 --> 01:00:50,720
Putting the Days to Bed.

1561
01:00:50,720 --> 01:00:51,920
It's a very, very good album.

1562
01:00:51,920 --> 01:00:55,120
And we are lucky that we're able to use it

1563
01:00:55,120 --> 01:00:55,920

1564
01:00:55,920 --> 01:00:56,240
Thank you.

1565
01:00:57,040 --> 01:00:57,440
Thank you.

1566
01:00:58,640 --> 01:00:59,920
Okay, that's going to do it for us.

1567
01:00:59,920 --> 01:01:00,640
Yeah.

1568
01:01:00,640 --> 01:01:02,080
Let's wrap this bad boy up.

1569
01:01:02,080 --> 01:01:05,120
This final wrap up sent in by Steven Horchak.

1570
01:01:05,120 --> 01:01:05,680
Thank you, Steven.

1571
01:01:05,680 --> 01:01:08,640
It's by Yahoo Answers user Donna who asks,

1572
01:01:10,640 --> 01:01:13,120
what is the national soup for USA?

1573
01:01:15,520 --> 01:01:16,640
My name is Justin McRoy.

1574
01:01:16,640 --> 01:01:17,680
I'm Travis McRoy.

1575
01:01:17,680 --> 01:01:18,800
I'm Griffin McRoy.

1576
01:01:18,800 --> 01:01:19,760
It's been my brother, my brother,

1577
01:01:19,760 --> 01:01:29,360
may kiss your dad's square on the lips.

Hi, I'm Sydney McElroy.

And I'm Riley Smurl.

1584

And we co-host a podcast called Still Buffering,

1585
01:01:50,480 --> 01:01:52,880
a sister's guide to teens through the ages.

1586
01:01:52,880 --> 01:01:56,400
On our show, we tackle all of the hot teen topics

1587
01:01:56,400 --> 01:01:58,320
that kids have on their minds today.

1588
01:01:58,320 --> 01:02:00,160
Hot teen topics?

1589
01:02:00,160 --> 01:02:04,160
Well, you know, the questions that are plaguing teenagers

1590
01:02:04,160 --> 01:02:06,880
through their tumultuous growing years.

1591
01:02:06,880 --> 01:02:09,280
Questions like, how do I party?

1592
01:02:09,280 --> 01:02:12,240
Or what do I do with all this hair everywhere?

1593
01:02:12,240 --> 01:02:14,640
The same questions that people like Sydney

1594
01:02:14,640 --> 01:02:16,880
had during their years as teenagers.

1595
01:02:16,880 --> 01:02:19,200
Many, many, many.

1596
01:02:19,200 --> 01:02:20,160
Okay, not that many.

1597
01:02:20,160 --> 01:02:22,000
So, so long ago.

1598
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:23,600
Yeah, okay, I think they get the idea.

1599
01:02:23,600 --> 01:02:27,760

And I was too.
