1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:30,800
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:49,600
When they turn those front house lights on, it really lets you know how dirty your glasses are.

6
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:55,600
Hello, Denver, and welcome to My Brother, My Brother, Me, an advice show for the modern era.

7
00:00:55,600 --> 00:01:05,760
I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy. Didn't get your fill earlier, I see.

8
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:13,600
I'm glad to see you're back for a second. I'm your middle-est brother, Travis McElroy.

9
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:23,920
It's going to be a Travis show. I'm your sweet baby brother in

10
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:39,440
30 under 30 media luminary, Griffin McElroy. Can we do that in a different order sometime

11
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:44,400
where it doesn't feel like a fuck? Denver, listen, the last thing Justin

12
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:48,720
said to Travis and I backstage, this is not a joke, and it's probably unprecedented,

13
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:53,280
I think, in our career of live performance. He said, y'all got to just watch your chill

14
00:01:53,280 --> 00:02:00,400
level out there because they are incredibly hyphy. I think he was suggesting we don't

15
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:04,560
match your level or else we'll just start fucking crowd surfing and you guys won't

16
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:09,680
get a very good podcast. We won't. We won't. We won't. We won't. We shan't.

17
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:19,040
Okay. We used to like horses a lot, and we thought coming to a beautiful horse town

18
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:24,640
like Denver, a town, I would say, competing with Louisville for how much they define

19
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:30,160
themselves by horses. Even Lexington too, I think, loves horses. They all love horses.

20
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:35,120
Think to yourself other cities that love horses because that's what this podcast

21
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:39,760
has been for a little bit now. Yeah. We thought they have such a powerful

22
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:46,160
horse in Denver. They celebrate them. They went to play football and they said,

23
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:53,200
let's call ourselves horses, and they said, no, no, no, no. We shall be the Magnum horse,

24
00:02:53,920 --> 00:03:01,360
the most powerful horses on earth, the Bronco. A bunch of sports fans in the audience tonight.

25
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:09,840
There always are at our shows, and that was until we landed at your airport.

26
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:14,160
Airport? Okay.

27
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:19,760
Some airport fans tonight. Hey, folks. What's with the horse?

28
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:29,840
Okay. I have two children, and I could not explain to them

29
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:36,000
some things about the horse. It's huge. It's fucking huge.

30
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:41,920
Unfathomable. It's blue, and it has glowing evil red eyes.

31
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:49,680
The demon. Who in your goddamn city looked at that and said,

32
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:53,680
that perfectly encapsulates what we want visitors to feel about this city?

33
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:59,520
Your greeting to this beautiful mountainous city is, yeah, come on in, motherfuckers.

34
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:06,880
I'm told it's nicknamed Blucifer. Okay.

35
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:09,760
Can I? Stop. Stop. Stop. Stop. Wait.

36
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:13,840
Why are you cheering for this horse? It's so fucking scary.

37
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:27,200
It looks like a scarecrow for evil alien crows that is designed to scare off aliens or something.

38
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:31,440
It's like if a monster came here, the monster would be like, oh, no, they've already got a monster.

39
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:36,960
If Godzilla came, he's like, I'm not doing battle with that. No way. No, thanks. Hard pass.

40
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:42,720
We do advice on this show. Justin, I don't know if he said it or not,

41
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:46,800
but sometimes we do other stuff, too. Like, for instance, Yahoo. Do you guys want Yahoo?

42
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:53,280
Oh, I'd love that. Could I get a bit more monitor?

43
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:57,600
The horniness is interfering with my ability to hear.

44
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:07,920
Here is one sent in by Adrian Cowles. Thank you, Adrian. It's Yahoo Answers user Billy who asks.

45
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:09,120
Billy? What a git.

46
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:16,080
Billy asks, does NASA drug test? I'm thinking of being an astronaut.

47
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:24,880
First of all, is astronaut just something you do on a whim?

48
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:32,480
It's not like getting a job at like a gas station. I think I'll apply at NASA. Just roll the dice.

49
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:37,280
Here's what I know about how to get a job at astronaut.

50
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:42,240
Aliens invade and they need all hands on deck. That's number one.

51
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:44,640
Number one. Maybe you have your own plane.

52
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:49,120
Maybe you have your own plane, sure. They technically were freelancers in Independence Day,

53
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:54,160
I'm pretty sure, but I'll meet you halfway. Three, you work at an oil rig and...

54
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:57,440
What the fuck was up with that movie?

55
00:05:58,480 --> 00:06:03,680
They didn't have to... The premise of that movie, it was easier to train

56
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:07,760
drillers to be astronauts than train astronauts to be drillers.

57
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:09,600
You're really indignant about this. I am.

58
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:15,760
Damn it. I think I would like to meet the person who's like,

59
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:22,480
I should stop doing drugs. I have been kicking around the idea of becoming an astronaut.

60
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:26,560
I think that the ship of time has already sailed for you.

61
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:34,640
There's no film where Randy Quaid decides in his mid-60s, he's like,

62
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:41,520
you know what? I've still got a great pitch. I'm going to be an astronaut. I'm going to pursue my

63
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:47,280
lifelong dream of finally becoming an astronaut. Just to correct you, the scenario would actually

64
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:52,480
be, I want to be an astronaut, but I'm not willing to give up. I'm smoking weed.

65
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:54,160
I very much want to do both. That's actually very true,

66
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:57,520
right? Because they could just quit and circumvent the problem.

67
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:03,680
Okay. Also, NASA wouldn't have a leg to stand on for drug testing because they would not be

68
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:10,320
where they are without drugged out people going, I want to go up there. That's where that starts.

69
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:12,400
Somebody looked at the moon and go, I want to eat that.

70
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:18,480
I feel like there's certain jobs. If you get elected president of the United States,

71
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:25,680
I don't think they can drug test you because who would do it?

72
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:28,960
I got drug tested at Best Buy.

73
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:34,800
The point is, they wouldn't be like, bad news, everybody. I know how you voted,

74
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:39,920
but you failed a drug test. I feel like astronauts, there's like, what,

75
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:43,520
like a hundred people living who've gone into space? I just made that up.

76
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:48,560
I don't think they're going to do it. I think you're totally fine.

77
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:51,520
I think you're going to totally fine. To be fair, they put them through pretty

78
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:56,560
rigorous testing. If you passed every test except a drug test, they'd be like,

79
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:59,680
still better than most, get up there. I'll tell you one thing.

80
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:04,880
They obviously know how to handle your shit. They sure don't test you while you're up there.

81
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:12,960
That's a good point. There is an argument to be made for ground control being like, well,

82
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:18,240
I mean, you're the one going in the rocket. You got to fear it, so fuck it.

83
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:22,080
If you want to get high, I guess. I mean, it seems ill-advised.

84
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:28,000
It certainly happened. Do you all know about John Young and the space sandwich that he ate?

85
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,720
I talked about this on Wonderful, so I apologize that I'm double dipping,

86
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:34,000
but there was an astronaut named John Young who was in the Gemini missions,

87
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:37,840
and he was in a mission with a dude named Gus, who I can't remember.

88
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:39,760
I just love that there was a guy with this. I'm Gus the astronaut.

89
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:42,160
I'm Gus, and I'm in space. He was probably great.

90
00:08:43,920 --> 00:08:48,080
There's a recording that you can find on YouTube of Gus like, what you got there?

91
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:52,240
And John Young's like, corned beef sandwich, brought it from home, and he just fucking

92
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:54,480
eats it, and Gus is like, wow, you brought a sandwich from home?

93
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:56,000
He's like, yeah, it stinks, doesn't it?

94
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:04,560
If that can happen, I don't see why you can't get like one joint up there in a fold of yours.

95
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:06,000
Did he get in trouble?

96
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,080
Yeah, he got very much in trouble when he got home, yes.

97
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:10,800
It was reprimanded by Congress.

98
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:17,040
Hey, we all got together. We're angry about your sandwich, John.

99
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:18,400
What are they going to do?

100
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:19,680
You're not allowed to go to space.

101
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:22,400
I already did.

102
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:25,360
You're not allowed to have sandwiches anymore.

103
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:31,040
The problem is, he got in trouble when he came home.

104
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:32,000
He shouldn't have came home.

105
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:37,920
I should have been like, hey, listen, we're super mad about the sandwich,

106
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:41,120
and as soon as you get down here, be like, I'm driving this bitch to Mars.

107
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:41,920
Fuck off.

108
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:42,800
Bye-bye.

109
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:43,520
Bye-bye.

110
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:44,400
Turning it around.

111
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:44,900
Bye.

112
00:09:44,900 --> 00:09:49,460
How about a question from one of our friends sitting before us?

113
00:09:49,460 --> 00:09:50,740
I've got loads.

114
00:09:51,700 --> 00:09:54,820
I hosted a murder mystery party at my home for a dozen friends.

115
00:09:56,020 --> 00:09:59,140
Everyone had a great time solving a spooky vampire murder.

116
00:10:00,020 --> 00:10:01,780
They wouldn't have told you if they didn't.

117
00:10:01,780 --> 00:10:03,940
I'm just saying, like, you went through a lot of...

118
00:10:03,940 --> 00:10:08,740
Also, couldn't you just get some garlic and smash it into all your friends' faces?

119
00:10:08,740 --> 00:10:10,020
Easy peasy, beautiful.

120
00:10:10,020 --> 00:10:13,620
Wait, that's not how a murder mystery party works.

121
00:10:13,620 --> 00:10:15,860
I'm just saying, if you're trying to find the vampire, sorry, Justin.

122
00:10:15,860 --> 00:10:19,140
But the real crime wasn't discovered until the following morning.

123
00:10:19,140 --> 00:10:22,100
Evidently, one of my guests fell on their way down to the basement

124
00:10:22,100 --> 00:10:24,500
and relieved themselves directly into my sewing box,

125
00:10:26,340 --> 00:10:28,820
filling it with an impressive amount of urine.

126
00:10:30,260 --> 00:10:33,940
There were no witnesses, and no one will admit to being the perpetrator.

127
00:10:34,980 --> 00:10:38,020
Brothers, this mystery has haunted me for months.

128
00:10:38,020 --> 00:10:40,020
Ah, a cold case.

129
00:10:40,020 --> 00:10:43,540
How can I uncover the criminal behind this heinous act?

130
00:10:43,540 --> 00:10:47,700
And what do I do with this information once I have?

131
00:10:47,700 --> 00:10:50,340
That's from Poor Man's Porro.

132
00:10:50,340 --> 00:10:52,820
We would have also accepted Piss Poor Porro.

133
00:10:52,820 --> 00:10:53,300
Yes.

134
00:10:53,300 --> 00:10:54,340
Would have been...

135
00:10:54,340 --> 00:10:56,260
Well, I answer the second part first.

136
00:10:56,260 --> 00:10:57,060
Are you here?

137
00:10:58,580 --> 00:10:59,220
All right.

138
00:10:59,220 --> 00:11:00,020
There's eight of you.

139
00:11:00,020 --> 00:11:01,700
You're a juvian throat singer.

140
00:11:01,700 --> 00:11:06,900
That's so weird that there's multiple people having this exact same situation.

141
00:11:06,900 --> 00:11:10,100
So once you figure out the information, you'll have them arrested.

142
00:11:10,100 --> 00:11:10,900
That's...

143
00:11:10,900 --> 00:11:12,020
We'll start there.

144
00:11:12,020 --> 00:11:14,020
They're going to go to jail for what they've done.

145
00:11:15,380 --> 00:11:16,420
It's a crime.

146
00:11:16,420 --> 00:11:17,460
It is a crime.

147
00:11:17,460 --> 00:11:18,420
It's a crime.

148
00:11:18,420 --> 00:11:23,220
You know, a lot of those puzzles can be really difficult to figure out,

149
00:11:23,220 --> 00:11:26,420
and I could see getting to a point in like an escape room

150
00:11:26,420 --> 00:11:30,580
where you might think like, maybe I'm supposed to piss in a sewing box.

151
00:11:31,380 --> 00:11:34,260
The clues seem to be leading me towards...

152
00:11:34,260 --> 00:11:36,100
I should piss in a sewing box.

153
00:11:36,100 --> 00:11:37,940
I should piss in the sewing box.

154
00:11:37,940 --> 00:11:42,660
The hint screen flashes like, uh, dog, I have to clean this up after everything.

155
00:11:44,260 --> 00:11:44,820
Look up here.

156
00:11:45,460 --> 00:11:47,380
I thought you were doing a haunted doll watch for a second.

157
00:11:47,380 --> 00:11:48,420
No, no, no.

158
00:11:48,420 --> 00:11:48,820
It's not...

159
00:11:48,820 --> 00:11:49,700
It didn't work like that.

160
00:11:51,940 --> 00:11:53,220
Yeah, I mean, you got...

161
00:11:53,220 --> 00:11:54,900
The good news is you have so many options.

162
00:11:55,940 --> 00:11:58,340
Did the original mystery come with a DNA test?

163
00:11:58,340 --> 00:12:00,100
I'm saying this out loud, and of course it didn't.

164
00:12:01,780 --> 00:12:04,820
I said DNA test like it was going to have a little like 23andMe thing

165
00:12:04,820 --> 00:12:06,260
that you could scoop some hot piss into.

166
00:12:06,260 --> 00:12:08,820
Is there DNA in urine?

167
00:12:08,820 --> 00:12:10,580
I'm willing to bet no.

168
00:12:12,180 --> 00:12:14,580
No audience poll time.

169
00:12:17,780 --> 00:12:18,180
Is there...

170
00:12:19,700 --> 00:12:21,300
Yes, it's a resounding yes.

171
00:12:21,300 --> 00:12:21,540
Okay.

172
00:12:24,580 --> 00:12:27,620
I didn't mean to set off just a wave of conversation.

173
00:12:27,620 --> 00:12:28,980
You don't know the answer.

174
00:12:28,980 --> 00:12:30,020
Maybe here's what you do.

175
00:12:30,020 --> 00:12:31,300
Here's what you do, right?

176
00:12:31,300 --> 00:12:34,420
Right now you probably call everyone like, did you pee in my sewing box?

177
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:34,740
Right?

178
00:12:34,740 --> 00:12:36,420
I'm not going to fess up to that.

179
00:12:36,420 --> 00:12:40,340
But if you go on and you're like, oh my God, somebody peed in the sewing box,

180
00:12:40,340 --> 00:12:41,540
it was hilarious.

181
00:12:41,540 --> 00:12:41,860
Yeah.

182
00:12:41,860 --> 00:12:42,740
Joke of the century.

183
00:12:42,740 --> 00:12:44,900
This person is the Banksy of Piss.

184
00:12:44,900 --> 00:12:45,460
Yeah.

185
00:12:45,460 --> 00:12:45,780
Right?

186
00:12:45,780 --> 00:12:48,500
That's the kind of thing where someone's going to be like, it wasn't me.

187
00:12:49,220 --> 00:12:50,980
Then you slap the cuffs on them.

188
00:12:50,980 --> 00:12:57,140
And then Banksy hears that and in a rage just like destroys his piss art he was working on.

189
00:12:58,500 --> 00:12:59,380
He had a...

190
00:12:59,380 --> 00:13:01,380
Oh my God, this is something Banksy would do.

191
00:13:01,380 --> 00:13:03,460
Okay.

192
00:13:03,460 --> 00:13:04,740
I'm saying...

193
00:13:04,740 --> 00:13:06,020
I don't think so.

194
00:13:06,020 --> 00:13:07,140
Could it be Banksy?

195
00:13:08,820 --> 00:13:10,340
Is one of your friends Banksy?

196
00:13:10,340 --> 00:13:12,340
I don't think it could be Banksy on this one.

197
00:13:12,340 --> 00:13:13,780
Is their last name Banks?

198
00:13:13,780 --> 00:13:15,860
And you just never put it together.

199
00:13:15,860 --> 00:13:17,140
Do they work at a bank?

200
00:13:17,140 --> 00:13:18,420
Do they live by a river?

201
00:13:18,420 --> 00:13:20,580
I don't think Banksy on this one.

202
00:13:20,580 --> 00:13:21,860
Here's what I would do.

203
00:13:21,860 --> 00:13:26,100
Send a group text to everybody who was at the party and say bad news.

204
00:13:26,100 --> 00:13:35,060
Bad news, my dog pisses in my sewing box.

205
00:13:35,060 --> 00:13:36,180
I'm going to have her put down.

206
00:13:38,740 --> 00:13:39,300
It's real...

207
00:13:40,100 --> 00:13:46,180
I'm real sad about it, but it said in the book that if they piss in your sewing box once,

208
00:13:46,180 --> 00:13:47,300
they're going to keep doing it.

209
00:13:47,300 --> 00:13:51,940
And I love to sew, so I've got a hatchet and I'm going to put my dog down.

210
00:13:51,940 --> 00:13:57,060
And then you just keep going and describing it.

211
00:13:57,060 --> 00:13:59,540
And eventually one of them is going to fucking crack.

212
00:13:59,540 --> 00:14:00,180
Yeah.

213
00:14:00,180 --> 00:14:02,020
It may not even be the person who did it.

214
00:14:03,700 --> 00:14:04,900
I'm the pisser.

215
00:14:05,540 --> 00:14:08,340
No, I'm the pisser.

216
00:14:08,340 --> 00:14:09,780
I'm Spartapus.

217
00:14:09,780 --> 00:14:11,940
You will accept it.

218
00:14:15,700 --> 00:14:17,300
I think you also have a great opportunity.

219
00:14:17,300 --> 00:14:20,260
I have been to exactly one murder mystery party in my life.

220
00:14:20,260 --> 00:14:21,620
It was really fun.

221
00:14:21,620 --> 00:14:24,260
I got blackout drunk before the thing even started.

222
00:14:25,460 --> 00:14:27,060
How do you know it was fun?

223
00:14:27,060 --> 00:14:29,460
I spent a lot of it doing deep breathing outside,

224
00:14:29,460 --> 00:14:32,740
but then they brought in this like cheesy garlic pull apart bread.

225
00:14:32,740 --> 00:14:33,940
I got no clues.

226
00:14:34,580 --> 00:14:37,460
I've been desperate to participate in a second murder mystery party,

227
00:14:37,460 --> 00:14:39,700
but it's a real hassle to put those on.

228
00:14:39,700 --> 00:14:44,820
You have a baked in second mystery party on your hands.

229
00:14:44,820 --> 00:14:49,060
You could say it's a Super Bowl party and then lock the door from the outside and say,

230
00:14:49,060 --> 00:14:51,700
we're not leaving here until everybody-

231
00:14:51,700 --> 00:14:54,180
You lock the door from the outside, then you come back in through the window.

232
00:14:54,180 --> 00:14:54,820
Yeah.

233
00:14:54,820 --> 00:14:57,140
I've got 13 sewing kits here.

234
00:14:58,100 --> 00:14:59,700
You all know what to do.

235
00:15:00,420 --> 00:15:03,460
The person who steps forward first, suspicious.

236
00:15:03,460 --> 00:15:03,700
Yeah.

237
00:15:04,260 --> 00:15:05,300
I'm comfortable with this.

238
00:15:07,380 --> 00:15:09,300
You could also measure it by volume.

239
00:15:11,620 --> 00:15:12,180
Volume.

240
00:15:13,220 --> 00:15:13,700
Aroma.

241
00:15:13,700 --> 00:15:14,420
This is gross.

242
00:15:14,420 --> 00:15:16,180
Do you guys want a Yahoo?

243
00:15:16,180 --> 00:15:16,420
Yes.

244
00:15:16,420 --> 00:15:18,500
Here's one that was sent in by a few people.

245
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:20,020
Thank you, a few people.

246
00:15:20,020 --> 00:15:23,460
It was asked by Yahoo Answers user, Emily, who asks,

247
00:15:23,460 --> 00:15:29,140
what non-toxic additions can you put into handmade soap to jazz it up?

248
00:15:31,140 --> 00:15:36,340
I'm learning to make soap so that I have a nice handmade gift to give to co-workers, friends, etc.

249
00:15:37,140 --> 00:15:40,100
I was wondering if there are any non-toxic additions I can add to it.

250
00:15:40,100 --> 00:15:43,460
I've tried apricot seeds, for example, and may try glitter.

251
00:15:43,460 --> 00:15:44,500
Thanks for your help.

252
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:45,460
Don't do glitter.

253
00:15:45,460 --> 00:15:46,740
Don't do glitter.

254
00:15:46,740 --> 00:15:47,780
Not glitter, though.

255
00:15:48,340 --> 00:15:49,460
Update, edit.

256
00:15:49,460 --> 00:15:50,980
Definitely won't use glitter.

257
00:15:50,980 --> 00:15:51,780
Thanks, everyone.

258
00:15:53,620 --> 00:15:55,700
Good thing I never made any glitter soaps.

259
00:15:57,860 --> 00:15:59,940
You could put other soap in the middle.

260
00:15:59,940 --> 00:16:01,380
You didn't even need to think about that one.

261
00:16:01,380 --> 00:16:01,780
No, yeah.

262
00:16:01,780 --> 00:16:03,700
If somebody gave me some handmade soap,

263
00:16:03,700 --> 00:16:06,820
and as I was washing my hand, in the middle was a bar of Irish spring,

264
00:16:06,820 --> 00:16:08,100
I'd be really excited.

265
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:14,580
I wouldn't wash my worst enemy's grundle with Irish spring.

266
00:16:14,580 --> 00:16:17,620
I don't know what good, what is good bar soap being said.

267
00:16:17,620 --> 00:16:18,980
I'll tell you what it is.

268
00:16:18,980 --> 00:16:23,780
It's that dove shit from the commercials where they pour it like a thing of milk and it forms the bar.

269
00:16:23,780 --> 00:16:28,660
When I was a kid, I saw that shit every time I thought, that looks delicious.

270
00:16:28,660 --> 00:16:29,780
Was that their intention?

271
00:16:30,580 --> 00:16:35,380
There was a long time, there's a long time when I was a kid where I believed scientifically you

272
00:16:35,380 --> 00:16:38,500
were not fully clean unless you were scientifically clean.

273
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:39,000
Sure.

274
00:16:39,860 --> 00:16:42,100
I think you could put a key in there.

275
00:16:44,100 --> 00:16:44,900
A key to what?

276
00:16:45,620 --> 00:16:46,260
Exactly.

277
00:16:48,740 --> 00:16:50,420
I'm clean and curious.

278
00:16:52,580 --> 00:16:53,460
A key.

279
00:16:53,460 --> 00:16:55,780
What about a juicy fruit center?

280
00:16:57,140 --> 00:16:59,860
Like a gusher, like a fruit gusher.

281
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:01,380
Like a gusher.

282
00:17:01,940 --> 00:17:02,660
What about dirt?

283
00:17:02,660 --> 00:17:07,140
It would be tough to get to it while it's still good to go.

284
00:17:08,820 --> 00:17:12,340
The moment the fruit juice touches the soapy interior, it's...

285
00:17:13,860 --> 00:17:16,740
At that point, what you've basically set up is like a center of fake blood.

286
00:17:19,140 --> 00:17:23,620
There's still a time where it's potable, but time lost is flavor loss.

287
00:17:23,620 --> 00:17:24,980
You need to crack that thing out of the box.

288
00:17:26,980 --> 00:17:32,100
Like Rafiki at the beginning of the Lion King, just like snap it over your face.

289
00:17:32,100 --> 00:17:32,660
Okay, wait.

290
00:17:32,660 --> 00:17:33,940
I would like to make a pitch.

291
00:17:33,940 --> 00:17:34,740
Yes.

292
00:17:34,740 --> 00:17:35,860
Soap on the outside.

293
00:17:35,860 --> 00:17:36,580
Yes.

294
00:17:36,580 --> 00:17:37,700
Mud on the inside.

295
00:17:40,340 --> 00:17:41,860
More soap in the middle.

296
00:17:41,860 --> 00:17:42,580
I love this.

297
00:17:43,220 --> 00:17:44,580
That's an afternoon right there.

298
00:17:44,580 --> 00:17:46,020
Yeah, you come back around.

299
00:17:46,900 --> 00:17:47,700
I do.

300
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:50,260
I tell you, Trav, holy shit.

301
00:17:50,260 --> 00:17:51,380
That's a good idea.

302
00:17:52,180 --> 00:17:56,660
Listen, listen, and this doesn't have to be nasty if you don't want it to be,

303
00:17:56,660 --> 00:17:59,860
but doesn't everybody like getting a little muddy sometimes?

304
00:17:59,860 --> 00:18:00,360
Right?

305
00:18:00,360 --> 00:18:04,120
And you know how like with an iPhone, they design it to break after a while,

306
00:18:04,120 --> 00:18:05,160
so you have to buy a new one?

307
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:10,760
Maybe in the middle of the soap, there's just a tiny little bit of mud just to finish it off.

308
00:18:10,760 --> 00:18:14,200
Well, now I've got to go back to the store and buy more of this specific soap

309
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:18,840
because all of his soaps have been bought up by Travis and I don't know, been ended.

310
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:21,960
Travis has ended all soap with that mud soap.

311
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:24,520
I hate this new dystopian future in which we live.

312
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:30,440
What if you just, what if a soap shaped like a canteen and it's filled with water

313
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:32,520
and then you got everything you need?

314
00:18:34,040 --> 00:18:34,920
For what?

315
00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:37,960
If you're ever on Survivor or any other sort of island thing,

316
00:18:38,840 --> 00:18:40,280
you got everything you need.

317
00:18:40,280 --> 00:18:43,720
You got water from your canteen and then the canteen-

318
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:44,520
Up with soap.

319
00:18:44,520 --> 00:18:47,160
That is, the canteen is soap, so you can clean yourself

320
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:51,480
because they don't have soap on the island for sure and water is in short supply.

321
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:56,600
So it's a canteen made of soap, you see, and it's filled with water.

322
00:18:57,800 --> 00:19:01,000
Water that has been in contact with soap?

323
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:06,280
Yeah, because that's how you know that the water is free of germs.

324
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:06,840
Hell yeah.

325
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:08,280
And safe.

326
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:10,360
Clean your fucking tummy out. I love this.

327
00:19:12,840 --> 00:19:16,680
Plus, if the soap gets hard in the sun, you can use it as a hatch to chop down some bamboo.

328
00:19:16,680 --> 00:19:19,400
You're not going to need the bamboo because you got your soap canteen

329
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:21,080
and all your needs are being catered to.

330
00:19:22,040 --> 00:19:24,200
Damn, Justin, that was a good idea, bud.

331
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:25,480
Thanks, thanks.

332
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:28,600
I'm unappreciated in my time.

333
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:30,520
Here's another question.

334
00:19:30,520 --> 00:19:33,960
I've worked at a large university and when I was hired,

335
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:38,680
I RSVP'd to compete in a salsa contest, but I became so-

336
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:42,200
I like the use of RSVP'd there instead of just like signed up.

337
00:19:42,760 --> 00:19:44,040
Yeah, volunteered.

338
00:19:44,040 --> 00:19:48,680
But I became so busy that suddenly the day of the contest was at hand

339
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:50,360
and I hadn't made any salsa.

340
00:19:50,360 --> 00:19:51,080
Rather than back-

341
00:19:51,080 --> 00:19:54,920
You can't go that long without specifying what kind of salsa you're talking about.

342
00:19:54,920 --> 00:19:55,400
Fair.

343
00:19:58,760 --> 00:20:01,960
Rather than back out, I decided to run to my local Chili's

344
00:20:01,960 --> 00:20:05,640
and ask them to fill a jar of salsa for me so that I could enter.

345
00:20:06,280 --> 00:20:07,960
I ended up winning the contest.

346
00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:12,040
It's now been eight years and people still ask me for the recipe.

347
00:20:14,040 --> 00:20:17,880
I've brushed off so many people that it's now built my salsa up

348
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:19,800
as some sort of mystical super salsa.

349
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:23,560
I love it when Goku goes super salsa.

350
00:20:29,560 --> 00:20:33,240
I love it when Goku goes super salsa.

351
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:38,520
I love it when Goku goes super salsa.

352
00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:40,200
Over 9,000 Scoville units.

353
00:20:43,560 --> 00:20:44,120
The number was 9,000.

354
00:20:44,120 --> 00:20:45,320
Aw, geek check.

355
00:20:46,520 --> 00:20:50,520
That no one has tasted since then because I'm afraid they'll definitely know it's Chili's

356
00:20:50,520 --> 00:20:51,880
if I break it into the office.

357
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:53,400
Brothers, what do I do?

358
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:55,000
I can't keep living this lie.

359
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,320
That's from Bluffing in Boulder, Colorado.

360
00:20:57,320 --> 00:21:00,520
Normally we would ask if you're here,

361
00:21:00,520 --> 00:21:03,080
but I feel like if I just looked, I would know who you are.

362
00:21:03,080 --> 00:21:07,480
But are you here?

363
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:09,560
All right.

364
00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:12,760
There is a lot to discuss here, but just real quick,

365
00:21:12,760 --> 00:21:15,560
I want to talk about one tiny element that jumped out at me.

366
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:19,160
When you went to Chili's and asked them to fill up a jar,

367
00:21:19,160 --> 00:21:24,280
did you present the jar to them or did they just have a jar ready for such a request?

368
00:21:24,280 --> 00:21:26,040
And Trav, I got to tell you, bud, and it's good.

369
00:21:26,040 --> 00:21:28,280
We all come at these questions from different angles.

370
00:21:28,280 --> 00:21:31,800
That's what creates the heat of the cauldron that boils up the soup

371
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:33,240
of my brother, my brother, and me.

372
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:36,440
That would have been about question 46 on my list.

373
00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:40,840
My first being, why didn't you go to the fucking grocery store

374
00:21:40,840 --> 00:21:42,680
where salsa is traditionally sold

375
00:21:42,680 --> 00:21:48,680
instead of trying to get back channel salsa from the baby back ribs place?

376
00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:52,440
I kind of feel like we need this person on mic.

377
00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:53,800
I feel like you need to come to the mic.

378
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:55,240
There's a lot of things we need to go through.

379
00:21:55,240 --> 00:21:56,920
If you don't want to, no pressure.

380
00:21:56,920 --> 00:21:57,800
You don't have to.

381
00:21:58,440 --> 00:21:58,920
Listen.

382
00:21:58,920 --> 00:21:59,880
Can we get a look?

383
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:01,560
If you're not comfortable, that's fine.

384
00:22:01,560 --> 00:22:02,600
Stay seated.

385
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:03,400
It's not a big deal.

386
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:05,160
If you're not comfortable, just right now, yell no.

387
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:07,400
No, no, no.

388
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:07,800
Hold on.

389
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:08,760
Don't you hear?

390
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:10,200
This is not a peer pressure.

391
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:12,040
Can we get some house lights, please?

392
00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:12,440
Oh, yeah.

393
00:22:12,440 --> 00:22:13,080
There we are.

394
00:22:13,080 --> 00:22:13,720
Thank you.

395
00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:14,040
Okay.

396
00:22:14,040 --> 00:22:14,600
Hi.

397
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:15,320
Hello.

398
00:22:15,320 --> 00:22:15,640
Hi.

399
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:17,480
Are you cool with this?

400
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:17,800
Hello.

401
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:19,640
Do you feel comfortable giving us your name?

402
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:20,360
Absolutely.

403
00:22:20,360 --> 00:22:21,000
I'm Vanessa.

404
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:23,320
You didn't even have to do the last name.

405
00:22:25,160 --> 00:22:26,360
Good luck with Facebook.

406
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:29,560
I saw co-workers here.

407
00:22:29,560 --> 00:22:35,080
Okay, Vanessa, why didn't you come to the mic?

408
00:22:35,080 --> 00:22:37,800
Vanessa, this is not a place for confession.

409
00:22:39,160 --> 00:22:40,280
Oh, no.

410
00:22:40,280 --> 00:22:40,520
Okay.

411
00:22:40,520 --> 00:22:42,040
Now, everybody, please be quiet.

412
00:22:42,040 --> 00:22:43,000
I need to talk to Vanessa.

413
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,600
Vanessa, why didn't you go to the grocery store?

414
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:46,600
I didn't.

415
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:49,640
I thought that I might have a chance to win with the chili sauce.

416
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:50,120
I knew it.

417
00:22:50,120 --> 00:22:51,560
I knew it.

418
00:22:51,560 --> 00:22:52,040
Okay.

419
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:53,640
I knew it.

420
00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:59,000
So, Vanessa, I love this because what I like about you, Vanessa,

421
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,840
is that you were like sitting there like,

422
00:23:00,840 --> 00:23:03,160
who's got the fucking best salsa in Boulder?

423
00:23:04,360 --> 00:23:07,160
Best salsa in Boulder has got to be chilies.

424
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:09,880
Vanessa?

425
00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:12,600
I was so worried that they would know it was chilies

426
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:14,840
that I actually watered it down.

427
00:23:14,840 --> 00:23:17,400
I watered it down with other tomatoes.

428
00:23:18,040 --> 00:23:18,520
Yeah.

429
00:23:18,520 --> 00:23:19,240
So, wait.

430
00:23:19,240 --> 00:23:19,720
Hold on.

431
00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:20,360
Hold on.

432
00:23:20,360 --> 00:23:22,520
Where did you get those fucking tomatoes from?

433
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:25,320
You had tomatoes then.

434
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:25,880
So, at your house-

435
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:31,240
You had 98% of salsa.

436
00:23:31,240 --> 00:23:34,840
Vanessa, I don't know why I do this,

437
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:37,320
but I'm ready to absolve you right now.

438
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:42,840
Because the good news is this is your salsa.

439
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:43,080
Yeah.

440
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:50,840
I mean, it is your salsa.

441
00:23:50,840 --> 00:23:55,720
Vanessa, there was a bunch of people at your office

442
00:23:55,720 --> 00:23:56,760
who have said to themselves,

443
00:23:56,760 --> 00:23:58,920
I love chili salsa, of course.

444
00:23:58,920 --> 00:24:00,840
It's just not tomato-y enough for me.

445
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:03,560
It's a little too zesty.

446
00:24:03,560 --> 00:24:04,680
A little too zesty.

447
00:24:04,680 --> 00:24:07,720
I love it to be muddled and watered down with some tomatoes.

448
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:09,320
You could, the next time someone asks,

449
00:24:09,320 --> 00:24:10,600
you can say, all right, fine.

450
00:24:10,600 --> 00:24:11,880
Here's my secret.

451
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:13,400
Got some tomatoes.

452
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:15,000
They can go to Chili's and boil them

453
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:17,000
into putting some salsa in a jar,

454
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,400
but leave some room in there for those tomatoes.

455
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:23,080
How did the, can you fill my loose jar with salsa now?

456
00:24:23,080 --> 00:24:25,400
I did bring a jar for it.

457
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:26,600
You did bring a jar for it.

458
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:27,240
Did you have-

459
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:28,600
Did you pay by the pound?

460
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:31,320
Did you have muddled up tomato mash

461
00:24:31,320 --> 00:24:32,520
at the bottom of the jar?

462
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:37,880
No, no, but I did put a special little thing on top of it

463
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:40,840
to decorate it, and then I called it Vanessa's Awesome Sauce.

464
00:24:40,840 --> 00:24:41,800
Come on.

465
00:24:41,800 --> 00:24:43,160
Vanessa.

466
00:24:43,160 --> 00:24:45,400
Vanessa, the bridge too far, Vanessa.

467
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:47,240
Do you wanna, like, should we stop talking

468
00:24:47,240 --> 00:24:50,120
while you finish listing the many crimes you committed

469
00:24:50,120 --> 00:24:51,320
during this heinous act?

470
00:24:52,360 --> 00:24:53,400
It was a prize.

471
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:55,240
I was money that I won.

472
00:24:55,240 --> 00:24:55,560
How much?

473
00:24:56,280 --> 00:24:57,720
It was 50 bucks.

474
00:24:57,720 --> 00:24:58,440
Nice.

475
00:24:58,440 --> 00:24:59,720
How much was the salsa?

476
00:25:00,840 --> 00:25:02,360
The salsa was about $10.

477
00:25:02,360 --> 00:25:05,880
I had just started, like, two weeks before, so-

478
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:08,440
Oh, you wanted to establish yourself.

479
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:11,960
Yeah, I mean, if anybody asks you the recipe,

480
00:25:11,960 --> 00:25:12,680
Justin's right.

481
00:25:12,680 --> 00:25:13,480
This is your own thing.

482
00:25:13,480 --> 00:25:17,960
You just say it's flavorless, watery tomatoes,

483
00:25:17,960 --> 00:25:19,080
and deceit.

484
00:25:21,480 --> 00:25:22,840
Vanessa, does that help?

485
00:25:22,840 --> 00:25:23,480
That helps.

486
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:23,720
Thank you.

487
00:25:23,720 --> 00:25:25,400
Thank you, Vanessa, for your honesty.

488
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:26,120
Thank you.

489
00:25:26,120 --> 00:25:27,800
You can bring the house lights down now.

490
00:25:29,080 --> 00:25:32,280
Once Vanessa's safely back to her seat,

491
00:25:32,280 --> 00:25:33,560
you can lower-

492
00:25:33,560 --> 00:25:35,560
I mean, you can go ahead and lower the house lights now.

493
00:25:35,560 --> 00:25:36,120
I believe-

494
00:25:36,120 --> 00:25:37,080
Oh, no, Vanessa's-

495
00:25:37,080 --> 00:25:37,800
Okay, there we go.

496
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:38,120
Good.

497
00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:38,760
I just don't want Vanessa-

498
00:25:38,760 --> 00:25:39,480
And there they go.

499
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:41,320
And there they go.

500
00:25:41,320 --> 00:25:42,840
Crawling down.

501
00:25:42,840 --> 00:25:44,120
My object permanence.

502
00:25:44,120 --> 00:25:44,840
Down.

503
00:25:44,840 --> 00:25:47,000
Listen to the sound of my voice.

504
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:48,280
The house lights are gone.

505
00:25:48,280 --> 00:25:50,200
The lights are dimming around you.

506
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:51,320
Be not afraid.

507
00:25:51,320 --> 00:25:53,800
This is an experience we're all having together.

508
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:55,640
We're all old.

509
00:25:55,640 --> 00:25:57,480
So they put in a switch to turn them on,

510
00:25:57,480 --> 00:25:58,760
and they're frantically like,

511
00:25:58,760 --> 00:25:59,880
guys, do these go off?

512
00:26:00,680 --> 00:26:03,080
And the lights are dimming.

513
00:26:03,080 --> 00:26:03,880
See, now I'm freaking out,

514
00:26:03,880 --> 00:26:04,920
because it looks like they're dimming,

515
00:26:04,920 --> 00:26:06,600
but I think I'm just losing my mind.

516
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:08,040
Okay, whatever.

517
00:26:08,040 --> 00:26:08,840
We'll keep doing the show.

518
00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:09,720
I want to move on.

519
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:11,160
Please do turn the lights off.

520
00:26:11,160 --> 00:26:14,840
Here's a Yahoo.

521
00:26:14,840 --> 00:26:17,080
I was sent in by Rob Luppy.

522
00:26:19,960 --> 00:26:20,760
Almost certainly not.

523
00:26:20,760 --> 00:26:22,200
It's Yahoo Answers user,

524
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:23,800
another part of me, who asks,

525
00:26:24,520 --> 00:26:25,880
and God, holy shit,

526
00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:26,840
I should have prefaced this.

527
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:28,760
This is going to be a fun one.

528
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:31,720
You guys get to play your games all the time.

529
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:33,640
I feel like you guys bring games to the show.

530
00:26:33,640 --> 00:26:34,680
This one's going to be fun for me,

531
00:26:34,680 --> 00:26:36,520
because I kind of know what's going on,

532
00:26:36,520 --> 00:26:37,240
and you won't.

533
00:26:37,240 --> 00:26:39,320
It's going to be a real hoot and a half.

534
00:26:39,320 --> 00:26:39,560
Okay.

535
00:26:39,560 --> 00:26:41,880
Okay, another part of me asks,

536
00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:44,840
boy zone scenario?

537
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:48,520
Okay, it's your birthday.

538
00:26:48,520 --> 00:26:49,880
Woot woot, LMAO.

539
00:26:56,360 --> 00:26:56,920
Woot woot.

540
00:26:58,360 --> 00:26:59,560
Your parents take you out.

541
00:26:59,560 --> 00:27:01,320
Hold on, nothing you just said

542
00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:03,400
would make someone laugh their ass off.

543
00:27:04,120 --> 00:27:04,920
It's your birthday.

544
00:27:06,920 --> 00:27:07,400
Great.

545
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:07,880
It is.

546
00:27:07,880 --> 00:27:09,560
I was born on this day.

547
00:27:09,560 --> 00:27:11,560
Thank you for your laughter.

548
00:27:12,120 --> 00:27:14,200
Your parents take you out to a lush restaurant,

549
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:15,880
and you need to use the toilet,

550
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:17,640
but leading towards the back door,

551
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:18,840
there's a trail of ink.

552
00:27:19,480 --> 00:27:21,560
This is the first mystery in this question.

553
00:27:22,760 --> 00:27:25,000
You follow it, and bam!

554
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:27,320
Boys zone are standing outside.

555
00:27:31,320 --> 00:27:32,840
What would you do?

556
00:27:32,840 --> 00:27:33,800
XD?

557
00:27:34,600 --> 00:27:35,000
XD?

558
00:27:36,120 --> 00:27:36,840
Oh, I see.

559
00:27:36,840 --> 00:27:37,480
Big face.

560
00:27:37,480 --> 00:27:38,440
I'm not done.

561
00:27:38,440 --> 00:27:41,160
Pets greater than sign birds.

562
00:27:44,280 --> 00:27:46,680
A emoticon where like one eye is kind of big,

563
00:27:46,680 --> 00:27:47,640
and then there's a flat mouth,

564
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:48,440
and then a small mouth.

565
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:49,480
Update.

566
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:51,720
WTF at Diana.

567
00:27:52,360 --> 00:27:54,280
Big eye, flat mouth, little eye.

568
00:27:56,120 --> 00:27:56,760
Begin.

569
00:27:58,200 --> 00:27:59,240
You have entered my labyrinth.

570
00:27:59,240 --> 00:28:00,200
Charles McElroy,

571
00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:02,120
do you understand this Yahoo answer?

572
00:28:02,120 --> 00:28:02,360
No.

573
00:28:04,040 --> 00:28:04,760
Griffin McElroy,

574
00:28:04,760 --> 00:28:06,520
do you understand this Yahoo answer?

575
00:28:06,520 --> 00:28:08,760
Only what a cursory Google searcher taught me.

576
00:28:08,760 --> 00:28:09,800
And I'm at a no.

577
00:28:09,800 --> 00:28:13,240
This is a no, no, no Google.

578
00:28:14,120 --> 00:28:15,720
Okay, here's what I do know.

579
00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:16,280
Yes?

580
00:28:16,280 --> 00:28:18,680
They have said that birds are better than pets.

581
00:28:18,680 --> 00:28:19,240
Yep.

582
00:28:19,240 --> 00:28:20,600
Nope, pets are better than birds.

583
00:28:20,600 --> 00:28:23,400
Oh, well, could birds not include?

584
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:24,760
Birds would be in pets.

585
00:28:24,760 --> 00:28:26,360
Yeah, to some people, extremely much so.

586
00:28:26,360 --> 00:28:27,480
This is chilling.

587
00:28:27,480 --> 00:28:27,720
Yeah.

588
00:28:28,680 --> 00:28:30,360
My phone a friend is going to be...

589
00:28:31,880 --> 00:28:32,760
What's a boys zone?

590
00:28:32,760 --> 00:28:36,440
I assume it's a boy band.

591
00:28:36,440 --> 00:28:37,320
Here, let me frame it to you

592
00:28:37,320 --> 00:28:39,480
in a more sort of coherent sort of story.

593
00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:39,720
Okay.

594
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:41,400
And then you guys can tell me what you do.

595
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:41,720
Okay.

596
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:42,680
You're at a lush restaurant.

597
00:28:42,680 --> 00:28:44,040
Your parents took you there.

598
00:28:44,040 --> 00:28:44,280
Okay.

599
00:28:45,240 --> 00:28:46,600
You have to go to the toilet.

600
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:47,000
Got it.

601
00:28:47,640 --> 00:28:49,560
There's a trail of ink on the floor.

602
00:28:49,560 --> 00:28:51,000
Okay, I have a lot of questions.

603
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:51,320
Okay.

604
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:54,040
You follow the trail of ink

605
00:28:54,040 --> 00:28:55,400
and you find yourself in the boys zone.

606
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:55,960
What do you do?

607
00:28:55,960 --> 00:29:01,160
Are, is boys zone like a team of squids?

608
00:29:04,520 --> 00:29:04,680
No.

609
00:29:06,120 --> 00:29:07,800
Is, is it...

610
00:29:10,600 --> 00:29:11,960
Is this, what's the...

611
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:13,720
You don't have to guess what boys zone is.

612
00:29:13,720 --> 00:29:15,400
Just tell me what the fuck you do.

613
00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:17,720
You follow, no, you follow the ink.

614
00:29:18,440 --> 00:29:21,320
You arrive at boys zone.

615
00:29:22,840 --> 00:29:24,360
I just, I can't,

616
00:29:24,360 --> 00:29:26,840
I can't determine through context clues

617
00:29:26,840 --> 00:29:28,600
if I'm excited or dismayed.

618
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:29,240
Damn it.

619
00:29:29,240 --> 00:29:30,040
What would you do?

620
00:29:32,040 --> 00:29:34,040
I probably start fighting my way out.

621
00:29:35,320 --> 00:29:36,760
That, I'll take that answer.

622
00:29:36,760 --> 00:29:37,640
Is this a...

623
00:29:37,640 --> 00:29:38,680
I'll give you a clue.

624
00:29:38,680 --> 00:29:39,720
You'll be outnumbered.

625
00:29:41,720 --> 00:29:43,480
Is this a splatoon thing?

626
00:29:45,160 --> 00:29:46,120
Absolutely not.

627
00:29:46,120 --> 00:29:46,440
Okay.

628
00:29:48,040 --> 00:29:49,320
This is what I love.

629
00:29:49,320 --> 00:29:51,080
You guys are thinking about the ink.

630
00:29:51,080 --> 00:29:51,640
You haven't,

631
00:29:51,640 --> 00:29:54,280
your minds haven't even conceived of the boys zone yet.

632
00:29:55,480 --> 00:29:58,040
If I, I think I would stay perfectly still

633
00:29:58,920 --> 00:30:01,320
and wait for the boys zone to...

634
00:30:01,320 --> 00:30:02,680
To migrate away.

635
00:30:02,680 --> 00:30:03,560
Migrator.

636
00:30:03,560 --> 00:30:06,040
Oh, I'd make myself big

637
00:30:06,040 --> 00:30:07,640
to see if I could scare them away.

638
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:09,240
That's good.

639
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:10,360
Threaten the boys zone.

640
00:30:10,360 --> 00:30:10,680
Yeah.

641
00:30:13,160 --> 00:30:14,520
Are they covered in ink?

642
00:30:16,360 --> 00:30:17,720
I don't believe so.

643
00:30:17,720 --> 00:30:21,400
No, are they like 17th century poets?

644
00:30:22,360 --> 00:30:25,800
Here, I can give you another clue.

645
00:30:27,080 --> 00:30:28,600
It's from Dirty Diana.

646
00:30:28,600 --> 00:30:29,960
So that's mystery one solved.

647
00:30:29,960 --> 00:30:30,680
Okay.

648
00:30:30,680 --> 00:30:33,480
Who says, best answer by the way.

649
00:30:33,480 --> 00:30:35,400
I see Ronan and he says,

650
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:37,160
you look gorgeous tonight.

651
00:30:37,160 --> 00:30:39,320
I blush as he bites his bottom lip.

652
00:30:39,320 --> 00:30:41,160
Then the rest is left to the imagination.

653
00:30:41,160 --> 00:30:42,120
I'll get reported.

654
00:30:42,120 --> 00:30:45,640
LMAO, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

655
00:30:45,640 --> 00:30:48,600
So that would be laughing my ass off.

656
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:49,480
There it goes.

657
00:30:49,480 --> 00:30:50,840
It's just flopping across the floor.

658
00:30:50,840 --> 00:30:54,040
So when he bites his lip

659
00:30:54,040 --> 00:30:55,960
and the rest that's left of the imagination

660
00:30:55,960 --> 00:30:57,160
is he eats his lip.

661
00:30:57,160 --> 00:30:57,480
Yeah.

662
00:30:57,480 --> 00:30:58,680
Some ink dribbles out.

663
00:30:59,720 --> 00:31:01,400
The ink dribbles out of his mouth.

664
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:03,640
And this is, there's a Ronan in the group.

665
00:31:03,640 --> 00:31:04,040
There is.

666
00:31:04,920 --> 00:31:07,000
It's like a samurai without a master, right?

667
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:12,680
Is that the Ronan?

668
00:31:12,680 --> 00:31:15,400
I'm going to reevaluate my standing still.

669
00:31:15,400 --> 00:31:18,040
I don't believe that'll be a match for the Ronan skills.

670
00:31:18,040 --> 00:31:18,360
Yeah.

671
00:31:19,720 --> 00:31:21,240
He's trained for that sort of thing.

672
00:31:23,080 --> 00:31:24,920
You all aren't even considering the possibility.

673
00:31:24,920 --> 00:31:26,920
It's a good thing that maybe the boys zone

674
00:31:26,920 --> 00:31:30,920
is just a fun place where boys can go and be boys in their zone.

675
00:31:31,960 --> 00:31:33,960
Well, if I'm allowed to be a boy.

676
00:31:33,960 --> 00:31:34,760
Final answer.

677
00:31:34,760 --> 00:31:37,720
What do you do when confronted with the boys zone, Travis?

678
00:31:37,720 --> 00:31:39,960
I'd probably start screaming for my parents.

679
00:31:40,840 --> 00:31:41,800
Out of?

680
00:31:41,800 --> 00:31:42,680
Huh?

681
00:31:42,680 --> 00:31:43,160
Fear?

682
00:31:43,160 --> 00:31:44,120
Excitement?

683
00:31:45,160 --> 00:31:46,440
Probably concern.

684
00:31:46,440 --> 00:31:47,000
Okay.

685
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:47,960
Justin.

686
00:31:47,960 --> 00:31:57,160
I would, I would ask for their autograph on their CD.

687
00:31:57,160 --> 00:31:58,600
Justin wins!

688
00:31:58,600 --> 00:31:59,160
Oh!

689
00:32:01,080 --> 00:32:02,520
They're an Irish boy band.

690
00:32:03,320 --> 00:32:03,720
Okay.

691
00:32:03,720 --> 00:32:07,000
They were active 1993 to 2000.

692
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:09,640
Wow, they got a fucking ahead of the game, huh?

693
00:32:09,640 --> 00:32:11,080
They got in and they got out.

694
00:32:12,200 --> 00:32:14,360
And then they got in because they're active now, 2007 to present.

695
00:32:14,360 --> 00:32:15,880
It's a man band now.

696
00:32:15,880 --> 00:32:16,360
Yes.

697
00:32:16,360 --> 00:32:17,800
It's a man zone.

698
00:32:17,800 --> 00:32:18,680
Man zone.

699
00:32:18,680 --> 00:32:20,120
Welcome to man place.

700
00:32:23,240 --> 00:32:24,280
Thank you for playing my game.

701
00:32:24,280 --> 00:32:25,560
I got so excited.

702
00:32:25,560 --> 00:32:28,440
I saw a boy zone and I instantly bookmarked it.

703
00:32:28,440 --> 00:32:29,400
I didn't even need to think fucking twice.

704
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:32,760
Do you have any information vis-a-vis pets and birds?

705
00:32:32,760 --> 00:32:33,400
Oh, no.

706
00:32:34,600 --> 00:32:34,840
What?

707
00:32:34,840 --> 00:32:37,000
Pets and birds, ink, lots of stuff.

708
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:37,960
The ink was unclear.

709
00:32:37,960 --> 00:32:40,360
The ink is a huge part of this.

710
00:32:40,360 --> 00:32:40,600
Yep.

711
00:32:41,560 --> 00:32:43,400
Because you would see the ink and think,

712
00:32:43,400 --> 00:32:45,160
maybe this will lead me to boy zone.

713
00:32:45,160 --> 00:32:47,880
Listen, we spent way too long on boy zone and I can admit that.

714
00:32:48,440 --> 00:32:50,280
What's the next question, Justin?

715
00:32:50,280 --> 00:32:55,000
Last year, my partner and I bought a house with a large Mickey Mouse sculpture mailbox.

716
00:32:56,200 --> 00:33:01,000
I don't like it very much, but I don't know how to get rid of slash destroy it.

717
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:05,240
I also kind of feel bad removing it as the previous owner sculpted it themselves.

718
00:33:06,680 --> 00:33:10,040
Any suggestions on how to deal with this massive mouse?

719
00:33:10,600 --> 00:33:13,240
And it says picture attached for scale.

720
00:33:13,240 --> 00:33:14,120
Let me see that bad boy.

721
00:33:14,120 --> 00:33:16,200
From too much mouse in Broomfield.

722
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:18,360
I'm going to show it to y'all.

723
00:33:18,360 --> 00:33:22,440
You're not going to be able to see great, but it is, it's a, the size.

724
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:24,760
Oh, it's the size of a full grown man.

725
00:33:24,760 --> 00:33:27,240
Size of a full grown man.

726
00:33:27,240 --> 00:33:31,160
And it seems to be made of stone.

727
00:33:32,360 --> 00:33:34,920
When I was reading this question initially, I thought,

728
00:33:35,880 --> 00:33:38,680
stop asking us questions that can be fixed by spin kicks.

729
00:33:39,240 --> 00:33:42,920
If you can spin kick it away, don't bring it to our desk.

730
00:33:42,920 --> 00:33:45,560
You would just break your fucking foot.

731
00:33:45,560 --> 00:33:45,960
Yeah.

732
00:33:45,960 --> 00:33:49,640
It's a very large mouse and it's a Fantasia era Mickey,

733
00:33:49,640 --> 00:33:52,360
which is among his most powerful forms.

734
00:33:52,360 --> 00:33:52,860
Sure.

735
00:33:52,860 --> 00:33:56,860
I will, I will say that's it.

736
00:33:56,860 --> 00:33:58,460
That's, you're going to have to move friendo.

737
00:33:59,020 --> 00:34:00,220
Credit where credit is due.

738
00:34:00,220 --> 00:34:02,060
It's a well sculpted Mickey.

739
00:34:02,060 --> 00:34:02,940
That's great.

740
00:34:02,940 --> 00:34:07,020
But I will point out the mailbox seems like kind of an afterthought.

741
00:34:07,020 --> 00:34:07,260
Sure.

742
00:34:08,620 --> 00:34:10,460
It's not in his belly or anything.

743
00:34:10,460 --> 00:34:11,900
Just one quick correction.

744
00:34:11,900 --> 00:34:15,340
You did say that it was your house.

745
00:34:15,340 --> 00:34:19,900
I believe if you really think about it, it is the statue of Mickey Mouse's house.

746
00:34:19,900 --> 00:34:22,220
It is the, it is the house of mouse you could say.

747
00:34:22,220 --> 00:34:26,540
And you live in the Mickey Mouse clubhouse and I'm, I'm really sorry about that.

748
00:34:26,540 --> 00:34:27,980
Are you here by the way?

749
00:34:27,980 --> 00:34:28,300
Hold on.

750
00:34:28,300 --> 00:34:28,860
Wait, are you here?

751
00:34:29,580 --> 00:34:30,140
Hello.

752
00:34:30,140 --> 00:34:30,460
Hello.

753
00:34:30,460 --> 00:34:36,380
Yeah, not to play along, but you did see it when you first considered buying the house, right?

754
00:34:36,940 --> 00:34:38,700
It didn't surprise you.

755
00:34:38,700 --> 00:34:41,820
You can't say no because you can see it from space.

756
00:34:44,060 --> 00:34:46,780
You probably thought, well, certainly they'll take that with them.

757
00:34:47,660 --> 00:34:50,940
There's no reason they would leave behind this beautiful art of the mouse.

758
00:34:50,940 --> 00:34:52,620
They would want to take it to their next home.

759
00:34:54,620 --> 00:34:55,980
Could you, here's a thought.

760
00:34:55,980 --> 00:34:56,380
Yes.

761
00:34:56,380 --> 00:35:04,460
Could you have the city redraw the bounds of your property so that the mouse is no longer.

762
00:35:04,460 --> 00:35:05,740
Just sort of, dude.

763
00:35:05,740 --> 00:35:08,540
The mouse becomes a small park at this point.

764
00:35:08,540 --> 00:35:09,820
Oh yeah, a pocket park.

765
00:35:09,820 --> 00:35:11,100
No longer your problem.

766
00:35:11,100 --> 00:35:12,380
It's just a local park.

767
00:35:12,380 --> 00:35:12,940
Ooh.

768
00:35:12,940 --> 00:35:15,260
As long as we're coming up with ideas for having the city fix it.

769
00:35:15,260 --> 00:35:23,500
If you carve a ding dong onto Mickey Mouse, I don't think the city will let it exist there sort of street side.

770
00:35:23,500 --> 00:35:24,380
Dickey Mouse.

771
00:35:24,380 --> 00:35:25,900
I feel like Travis is just.

772
00:35:32,540 --> 00:35:37,500
Could you call Disney and tell them there's a copyright violation in your yard?

773
00:35:37,500 --> 00:35:37,740
Yes.

774
00:35:39,420 --> 00:35:40,220
Yes.

775
00:35:40,220 --> 00:35:41,980
It seems like they'd take care of it.

776
00:35:41,980 --> 00:35:44,620
And maybe you.

777
00:35:44,620 --> 00:35:50,620
If they don't, you have to start building other Disney themed mailboxes next to it.

778
00:35:50,620 --> 00:35:53,260
Until it's just like, they can't ignore it anymore.

779
00:35:53,260 --> 00:35:59,820
Once you got fucking Ant Man and Baloo the bear and all the, you know.

780
00:35:59,820 --> 00:36:01,020
All the hit characters.

781
00:36:01,020 --> 00:36:02,460
All the great Disney characters.

782
00:36:02,460 --> 00:36:04,460
Yeah, all the main Disney stays.

783
00:36:04,460 --> 00:36:05,740
The big Disney, the big names.

784
00:36:05,740 --> 00:36:11,020
Mickey, Ant Man, Baloo, Lilo, Stitch, whatever.

785
00:36:11,020 --> 00:36:15,420
It's a big mailbox though.

786
00:36:20,060 --> 00:36:20,380
Yeah.

787
00:36:20,380 --> 00:36:25,100
Hey, I kept the picture up because I didn't want this to become a joke to me.

788
00:36:25,100 --> 00:36:30,460
I needed it to stay real because there's real people that are affected by this very large mouse.

789
00:36:30,460 --> 00:36:32,860
Hey, what are you going to do?

790
00:36:33,500 --> 00:36:34,620
Yeah, but really.

791
00:36:34,620 --> 00:36:36,460
It's a big fucking mailbox.

792
00:36:36,460 --> 00:36:41,500
I'm going to go fly home to West Virginia tomorrow and you're still going to have this mouse.

793
00:36:41,500 --> 00:36:42,940
We can make a lot of jokes up here, but.

794
00:36:42,940 --> 00:36:45,100
It's a lot of fun and you're expensive.

795
00:36:45,100 --> 00:36:46,620
The mouse will still remain.

796
00:36:47,260 --> 00:36:49,820
The mouse will be there long after you die.

797
00:36:49,820 --> 00:36:50,620
Yeah, a lot.

798
00:36:50,620 --> 00:36:52,380
Nothing will move this mouse.

799
00:36:52,380 --> 00:36:53,740
Yeah, good luck.

800
00:36:53,740 --> 00:36:56,620
Oh, do you want a water feature in your front yard?

801
00:36:56,620 --> 00:37:01,340
If so, maybe just some sort of ramp that pushes the water upwards.

802
00:37:01,340 --> 00:37:03,660
We'll have to get some sort of engineers.

803
00:37:03,660 --> 00:37:04,540
I'm not one.

804
00:37:04,540 --> 00:37:11,900
That just slowly drips water down onto the Mickey statue over a period of millennia.

805
00:37:13,260 --> 00:37:18,540
If you're like me, a lazy person, you probably looked at that mouse and you bought the house

806
00:37:18,540 --> 00:37:20,620
and thought, I like Mickey.

807
00:37:24,140 --> 00:37:24,700
I'll learn.

808
00:37:24,700 --> 00:37:30,860
I'll learn to get into Mickey more so that I could be someone with a affection commiserate

809
00:37:30,860 --> 00:37:35,900
with this size and heft of a statue surrounding my mailbox.

810
00:37:37,260 --> 00:37:38,220
You probably blow it up.

811
00:37:39,340 --> 00:37:40,940
Blow it up with a bomb.

812
00:37:40,940 --> 00:37:41,500
Blow it up.

813
00:37:41,500 --> 00:37:42,540
Just the thing you could do.

814
00:37:42,540 --> 00:37:43,980
I've watched a lot of Mythbusters.

815
00:37:44,620 --> 00:37:45,420
I would imagine.

816
00:37:45,420 --> 00:37:47,980
You call the Mythbusters, say like, hey, I got a myth.

817
00:37:49,020 --> 00:37:53,980
Can you blow up a Mickey mailbox any which way?

818
00:37:55,980 --> 00:37:56,940
Challenge accepted.

819
00:37:56,940 --> 00:37:57,820
I got him again.

820
00:37:57,820 --> 00:38:02,060
Can you take my, it's a myth, can you take my trash out?

821
00:38:04,620 --> 00:38:13,020
I don't know what the connotation is, but I have to imagine that this mailbox has become

822
00:38:13,020 --> 00:38:15,420
extremely significant to your mail carrier.

823
00:38:16,620 --> 00:38:22,220
This is either how they start their day, end their day, a good like, well, I'm one-third done.

824
00:38:22,220 --> 00:38:23,020
There's Mickey.

825
00:38:23,900 --> 00:38:24,300
I know.

826
00:38:25,020 --> 00:38:26,140
Time for lunch.

827
00:38:26,140 --> 00:38:27,580
I'm so tired, but...

828
00:38:27,580 --> 00:38:29,100
I'm one step closer to Mickey.

829
00:38:29,100 --> 00:38:33,980
I do get to see Mickey at the end of my day, and I do love that zany mouse.

830
00:38:33,980 --> 00:38:34,620
There's also...

831
00:38:35,580 --> 00:38:39,660
And then the day he delivers the bomb, you will use to explode the Mickey statue.

832
00:38:39,660 --> 00:38:42,380
It will be the sweetest, coolest irony of his life.

833
00:38:45,580 --> 00:38:48,940
There's a very good chance that they sold this house because of the Mickey.

834
00:38:52,300 --> 00:38:54,060
I didn't mean to build it so big.

835
00:38:54,060 --> 00:38:59,020
He's, whoever the owner was started carving it and then finished was like, what have I done?

836
00:39:00,700 --> 00:39:02,540
This was supposed to be Goofy.

837
00:39:03,020 --> 00:39:04,860
I did such a bad job.

838
00:39:05,420 --> 00:39:07,580
You don't want to fucking give Goofy your mail.

839
00:39:07,580 --> 00:39:12,780
Listen, guys, my son became a big fan of that whole universe when we went to Disney earlier this year.

840
00:39:12,780 --> 00:39:15,340
You cannot trust Goofy with mail.

841
00:39:15,340 --> 00:39:19,900
That dude can't accomplish anything without showing his whole ass.

842
00:39:21,900 --> 00:39:22,860
Can I do a yahoo?

843
00:39:22,860 --> 00:39:24,140
Can I do a yahoo?

844
00:39:25,180 --> 00:39:25,500
Yeah.

845
00:39:26,460 --> 00:39:28,780
This one was sent in by Nathan's...

846
00:39:28,780 --> 00:39:30,700
Justin, I feel like you're still distracted by how big the mailbox is.

847
00:39:30,700 --> 00:39:32,860
You're really looking at the big Mickey statue.

848
00:39:32,860 --> 00:39:35,180
It's so big, it'll be there tomorrow.

849
00:39:41,900 --> 00:39:42,860
Here's one sent in by...

850
00:39:43,500 --> 00:39:43,900
All right.

851
00:39:43,900 --> 00:39:51,580
Consider the possibility.

852
00:39:54,460 --> 00:39:56,860
You might find the yahoo enjoyable also.

853
00:39:57,820 --> 00:39:59,100
It was sent in by Nathan Smith.

854
00:39:59,100 --> 00:39:59,660
I'm going to have to take two.

855
00:39:59,660 --> 00:40:00,620
Yeah, turn it off.

856
00:40:00,620 --> 00:40:01,500
Yeah, thank you.

857
00:40:08,940 --> 00:40:10,300
Oh, give me this.

858
00:40:10,300 --> 00:40:12,620
Yeah, Nathan Smith sent this in.

859
00:40:12,620 --> 00:40:14,860
Thank you, Nathan. It's an anonymous yahoo answers user.

860
00:40:14,860 --> 00:40:16,380
I'm going to call Dickie who asks...

861
00:40:24,540 --> 00:40:30,780
Is a vegan allowed to eat extremely wafer-thin ham?

862
00:40:30,780 --> 00:40:40,300
Now, listen.

863
00:40:45,260 --> 00:40:48,780
Listen, your gut instinct is going to say,

864
00:40:50,140 --> 00:40:50,380
no.

865
00:40:52,860 --> 00:40:53,580
The ham.

866
00:40:54,380 --> 00:40:56,940
What if I told you I can get it so fucking thin?

867
00:40:56,940 --> 00:41:01,820
You could put it in front of you and hold it with both hands and blow,

868
00:41:01,820 --> 00:41:03,820
and it would turn into a bubble and fly away.

869
00:41:03,820 --> 00:41:04,940
So thin, this ham.

870
00:41:05,660 --> 00:41:07,580
Could you hide it in other vegetables?

871
00:41:07,580 --> 00:41:07,980
It was so thin.

872
00:41:07,980 --> 00:41:09,180
No, it can't be a trick.

873
00:41:09,180 --> 00:41:12,540
They have to mindfully eat the thin ham.

874
00:41:13,100 --> 00:41:16,460
They will say, I can't do this with anything else.

875
00:41:17,020 --> 00:41:18,620
This ham's so fucking thin.

876
00:41:18,620 --> 00:41:20,780
I can see my friends through it.

877
00:41:20,780 --> 00:41:22,460
I can see you through it.

878
00:41:22,460 --> 00:41:23,660
It's the thinnest ham.

879
00:41:24,540 --> 00:41:25,900
Barely there ham.

880
00:41:25,900 --> 00:41:29,580
There is a thinness of ham where statistically speaking,

881
00:41:29,580 --> 00:41:31,420
you're not even really eating ham.

882
00:41:31,420 --> 00:41:32,220
Yes.

883
00:41:32,220 --> 00:41:32,700
Yes.

884
00:41:32,700 --> 00:41:34,460
You're inhaling ham.

885
00:41:34,460 --> 00:41:36,220
You're breathing ham in.

886
00:41:36,220 --> 00:41:36,700
Yeah.

887
00:41:36,700 --> 00:41:39,020
No, that's got to have some chew to it.

888
00:41:39,020 --> 00:41:42,220
Yeah, and the ham flavor that makes it so delicious and desirable.

889
00:41:42,220 --> 00:41:43,420
Will be present.

890
00:41:43,420 --> 00:41:47,420
Is there a thinness of ham that you could walk through it like a cobweb

891
00:41:47,420 --> 00:41:48,540
and get some in your mouth?

892
00:41:49,980 --> 00:41:51,500
Who hung all this ham here?

893
00:41:52,300 --> 00:41:55,180
This is Travis's fucked up reboot of Charlotte's Web

894
00:41:55,180 --> 00:41:56,380
where they switch places.

895
00:41:59,900 --> 00:42:01,100
Oh, that was some pig.

896
00:42:02,940 --> 00:42:06,620
Your fucking ceiling pig has written cool spider and ham.

897
00:42:09,980 --> 00:42:12,620
This is a thinness of ham where Wilbur should be able

898
00:42:12,620 --> 00:42:14,380
to peel them off of himself.

899
00:42:14,940 --> 00:42:16,140
Okay, that's it.

900
00:42:16,700 --> 00:42:18,940
This is cruelty free.

901
00:42:18,940 --> 00:42:19,580
We are talking-

902
00:42:19,580 --> 00:42:22,060
Well, a little cruel.

903
00:42:22,060 --> 00:42:22,380
No.

904
00:42:22,380 --> 00:42:24,380
You are shaving a pig.

905
00:42:24,380 --> 00:42:25,580
No, you get it.

906
00:42:25,580 --> 00:42:26,780
It's cruelty free.

907
00:42:26,780 --> 00:42:30,460
It's like peelings, like sunburn, you know?

908
00:42:31,660 --> 00:42:35,740
Get some pumice stone in the pig pen, whatever they rub off.

909
00:42:35,740 --> 00:42:37,180
Ham dandruff, basically.

910
00:42:37,180 --> 00:42:38,220
It's ham dandruff.

911
00:42:38,220 --> 00:42:39,020
Ham dandruff, yes.

912
00:42:39,020 --> 00:42:41,340
It's pressed ham dandruff, basically.

913
00:42:42,380 --> 00:42:42,940
Fine.

914
00:42:42,940 --> 00:42:45,420
I need you all to take over the show for 10 minutes

915
00:42:45,420 --> 00:42:50,780
while I write out the entire spec script to Wilbur's ham zone

916
00:42:50,780 --> 00:42:55,420
because my mind is just racing with possibilities.

917
00:42:57,660 --> 00:43:01,020
The farmers would not like the huge spider in their barn.

918
00:43:01,660 --> 00:43:05,900
Wilbur would have a pretty tough road to hoe ahead of him.

919
00:43:05,900 --> 00:43:09,180
Listen, we got to do a pretty strong BR campaign here.

920
00:43:09,980 --> 00:43:10,460
Get the gun.

921
00:43:10,460 --> 00:43:12,060
There's a big monster spider in the barn.

922
00:43:12,060 --> 00:43:13,900
What's it saying ham up there?

923
00:43:13,900 --> 00:43:14,620
No, don't.

924
00:43:14,620 --> 00:43:15,980
Think of the tax benefits?

925
00:43:15,980 --> 00:43:17,420
Shit, I didn't think about that.

926
00:43:17,420 --> 00:43:22,540
What's it saying the ham up there is one of the best sentences I've ever heard.

927
00:43:22,540 --> 00:43:23,500
Wait, hold on.

928
00:43:23,500 --> 00:43:25,580
Let's read the ham first, John.

929
00:43:25,580 --> 00:43:26,060
Read the ham.

930
00:43:26,060 --> 00:43:26,860
What's it say?

931
00:43:26,860 --> 00:43:29,740
It's blood is acidic and will get on you and you'll die.

932
00:43:29,740 --> 00:43:30,460
Damn, all right.

933
00:43:30,460 --> 00:43:31,900
Can't shoot the spider yet.

934
00:43:31,900 --> 00:43:34,140
Thanks for the warning, ceiling pig.

935
00:43:34,140 --> 00:43:37,260
The ham up there is my favorite movie starring Kevin Bacon.

936
00:43:38,300 --> 00:43:41,500
Hey, there was two.

937
00:43:41,500 --> 00:43:51,500
There's two in it.

938
00:43:55,500 --> 00:43:59,500
These guys too much, too much, too fast.

939
00:43:59,500 --> 00:44:01,660
These guys, these are they real brothers?

940
00:44:02,300 --> 00:44:06,220
You know, I've heard that it's all a government conspiracy.

941
00:44:07,340 --> 00:44:10,300
Speaking of a government conspiracy for your genitals,

942
00:44:10,300 --> 00:44:12,540
that's how we like to refer to me undies.

943
00:44:13,580 --> 00:44:16,460
You can get everything you need for you and your loved ones at me undies.

00:44:25,980 --> 00:44:27,500
Do they have holiday prints?

947
00:44:27,500 --> 00:44:28,860
They do, they do.

948
00:44:29,420 --> 00:44:31,740
They make great stocking stuffers.

949
00:44:31,740 --> 00:44:34,220

You can do that shit Christmas morning, probably, I bet.

Probably on your phone or something.

956
00:44:49,180 --> 00:44:50,140

957
00:44:50,140 --> 00:44:51,020

00:44:51,020 --> 00:44:53,100

961
00:45:02,780 --> 00:45:06,540
That's meundies.com slash my brother.

962
00:45:06,540 --> 00:45:09,420
And once you finish putting a Santa Claus on your duff,

963
00:45:09,420 --> 00:45:13,180
why don't you go to Stitch Fix and put something on over those nasty things.

964
00:45:15,420 --> 00:45:16,700
Hey, Stitch Fix is good.

965
00:45:16,700 --> 00:45:19,500
It's an online personal styling service that finds and delivers

966
00:45:19,500 --> 00:45:22,460
clothes, shoes, and accessories that fit your body budget and lifestyle.

967
00:45:22,460 --> 00:45:29,980
I gotta say, my shopper, my stylist has really dialed in on my shit.

968
00:45:30,540 --> 00:45:35,260
Not only on my styles, but the fit on everything has been so choice lately.

969
00:45:35,260 --> 00:45:39,900
They helped me realize, Justin, my legs are considerably shorter than I used to think they

970
00:45:39,900 --> 00:45:40,300
were.

971
00:45:40,300 --> 00:45:43,900
I would wear those jeans and I would get the holes at the bottoms of them like a skater.

972
00:45:43,900 --> 00:45:46,380
Then it's because my freaking pant legs were too long.

973
00:45:46,380 --> 00:45:49,340
They helped me dial that shit in and now my clothes fit better than ever.

974
00:45:50,140 --> 00:45:51,020
So it's great.

975
00:45:51,020 --> 00:45:52,860

990
00:46:29,100 --> 00:46:33,180
We hope you're enjoying yourself with this delightful episode.

991
00:46:33,180 --> 00:46:35,660
And thank you for listening.

992
00:46:35,660 --> 00:46:36,300
We appreciate you.

993
00:46:36,300 --> 00:46:38,780
Thank you to Denver for coming out.

994
00:46:38,780 --> 00:46:41,740
It was one of the most rowdy shows we've done in a long time.

995
00:46:41,740 --> 00:46:43,020
And it was a lot of fun.

996
00:46:43,020 --> 00:46:44,060
We have a new website.

997
00:46:44,060 --> 00:46:47,580
We are going to keep talking about it for, I don't know, a little bit until people get

998
00:46:47,580 --> 00:46:49,100
sick of it, which may be now.

999
00:46:49,100 --> 00:46:53,820
But if you go to mackleroy.family or the mackleroy.family, you can find our website.

1000
00:46:53,820 --> 00:46:56,300
It's we teamed up with Vox to make it.

1001
00:46:56,300 --> 00:47:01,660
We're still on the Max Fun Network, and in fact, all of the shows we do on Max Fun and

1002
00:47:01,660 --> 00:47:04,780
off are on mackleroy.family.

1003
00:47:04,780 --> 00:47:05,580
You can find them there.

1004
00:47:05,580 --> 00:47:08,060
You can find new merch announcements.

1005
00:47:08,060 --> 00:47:09,420
And you can find general news.

1006
00:47:09,420 --> 00:47:13,900
Like for instance, this week we're probably going to be announcing an upcoming tour.

1007
00:47:13,900 --> 00:47:22,140
So keep an eye on mackleroy.family to find out more and also our social channels.

1008
00:47:23,580 --> 00:47:24,460
Thanks for listening.

1009
00:47:24,460 --> 00:47:26,620
And we'll be back with you again soon.

1010
00:47:26,620 --> 00:47:27,120
Bye.

1011
00:47:28,300 --> 00:47:30,300
Hello, Maximum Fun.

1012
00:47:30,300 --> 00:47:34,460
I am Oliver Wong, scholar, journalist, DJ, et cetera.

1013
00:47:34,460 --> 00:47:35,260
And I'm Morgan Rold.

1014
00:47:35,260 --> 00:47:37,820
I'm a music supervisor who loves stilettos.

1015
00:47:37,820 --> 00:47:42,620
We host Heat Rocks, a music podcast where we talk to influential artists and scholars

1016
00:47:42,620 --> 00:47:45,500
about the albums that changed their lives.

1017
00:47:45,500 --> 00:47:50,380
On our most recent episode, we had the chance to talk with none other than R&B legend Macy

1018
00:47:50,380 --> 00:47:56,780
Gray about one of her favorite albums, My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy by Yeezy.

1019
00:47:56,780 --> 00:48:02,380
We get deep talking about everything from Kanye's college dropout days all the way up

1020
00:48:02,380 --> 00:48:04,780
to his most recent shenanigans.

1021
00:48:04,780 --> 00:48:07,740
I just think it's weak, and I don't think he has to do that.

1022
00:48:07,740 --> 00:48:09,420
And I was just disappointed.

1023
00:48:09,420 --> 00:48:15,100
So make sure you, dear listener, are subscribed because you definitely do not want to miss

1024
00:48:15,100 --> 00:48:16,220
this conversation.

1025
00:48:16,220 --> 00:48:20,940
Heat Rocks every Thursday right here on Maximum Fun.

1026
00:48:20,940 --> 00:48:23,020
Uh, how about another question?

1027
00:48:23,020 --> 00:48:23,900
Yeah, another guy.

1028
00:48:30,140 --> 00:48:31,100
Just start reading it.

1029
00:48:31,100 --> 00:48:55,020
Here is one sent in.

1030
00:48:55,020 --> 00:48:56,380
No, no, you'll mess me up.

1031
00:48:57,340 --> 00:48:59,580
It's like rhythmless, free form kind of.

1032
00:48:59,580 --> 00:49:06,060
Okay.

1033
00:49:06,060 --> 00:49:10,060
I want a Munch Squad!

1034
00:49:10,060 --> 00:49:15,180
I want to Munch Squad!

1035
00:49:15,180 --> 00:49:16,060
Welcome to Munch Squad.

1036
00:49:19,420 --> 00:49:27,500
The only podcast segment within a built-in cocktail artist, Paul Saborin.

1037
00:49:27,500 --> 00:49:31,820
I like that Paul said I shouldn't bring Justin a full bottle of liquor while he's doing the

1038
00:49:31,820 --> 00:49:34,380
stinger for Munch Squad because who knows what might happen.

1039
00:49:34,380 --> 00:49:39,980
Hey, big ups to Denver hooked your boy up with the Hennessy VSOP privilege.

1040
00:49:40,700 --> 00:49:41,180
Thank you.

1041
00:49:42,700 --> 00:49:44,300
We still got a lot of show left.

1042
00:49:44,300 --> 00:49:51,340
Sonic, ads, Fritos, chili cheese faves, starting at 99 cents.

1043
00:49:51,340 --> 00:49:55,980
You know, folks, if something's your fave, the price should be immaterial.

1044
00:49:55,980 --> 00:50:03,340
If it's truly your chili cheese fave, you shouldn't need that 99 cents to be appended there.

1045
00:50:03,340 --> 00:50:05,420
It could be 70, 80 dollars.

1046
00:50:05,420 --> 00:50:07,340
You still buy it because it's your fave.

1047
00:50:07,340 --> 00:50:13,580
But starting at just 99 cents, guests can order the Sonic Fritos chili pie and Fritos

1048
00:50:13,580 --> 00:50:18,140
chili cheese junior wrap along with the Fritos Fritos chili cheese.

1049
00:50:18,140 --> 00:50:19,660
Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry.

1050
00:50:19,660 --> 00:50:22,300
You can't, you can't have possibly said that correctly.

1051
00:50:22,300 --> 00:50:22,780
Sorry.

1052
00:50:22,780 --> 00:50:23,260
That can't be it.

1053
00:50:23,260 --> 00:50:25,180
Travis, can please confirm?

1054
00:50:25,180 --> 00:50:30,700
Fuck the Fritos Fritos chili cheese junior burger.

1055
00:50:30,700 --> 00:50:33,500
The Fritos Fritos chili burger burger.

1056
00:50:36,140 --> 00:50:39,980
This is when the Munch Squad robot became sentient and insane.

1057
00:50:41,100 --> 00:50:44,540
Fritos Fritos chili cheese junior burger.

1058
00:50:44,540 --> 00:50:46,860
That's starting at 199, folks.

1059
00:50:46,860 --> 00:50:51,180
Sonic, human beings would have to order that with their mouth and eat it.

1060
00:50:51,180 --> 00:50:54,540
Frito Frito chili chili cheese burger burger burger.

1061
00:50:54,540 --> 00:50:56,220
We didn't start the fire.

1062
00:51:03,660 --> 00:51:06,460
Yeah, Sonic Drive-In is taking the quirky.

1063
00:51:07,100 --> 00:51:09,180
That word doesn't mean fucking anything anymore.

1064
00:51:10,060 --> 00:51:16,460
The quirky comforting flavors of a beloved snack and making it available for any location

1065
00:51:16,460 --> 00:51:22,940
any time by adding new Fritos chili cheese options to a variety of menu items with at

1066
00:51:22,940 --> 00:51:29,100
least three ways to add a warm, salty and savory crunch to any meal.

1067
00:51:29,740 --> 00:51:34,780
The new Sonic Fritos chili cheese faves started just 99 cents.

1068
00:51:34,780 --> 00:51:36,380
So what are these faves?

1069
00:51:36,380 --> 00:51:41,500
Well, the Fritos chili pie is made with crunchy Fritos,

1070
00:51:41,500 --> 00:51:44,860
savory chili and topped with melty cheddar cheese.

1071
00:51:44,860 --> 00:51:45,180
Good.

1072
00:51:47,340 --> 00:51:48,460
I know this friend.

1073
00:51:48,460 --> 00:51:50,380
This friend I'm familiar with and I enjoy his work.

1074
00:51:50,380 --> 00:51:54,620
The Fritos chili cheese junior wrap includes the same delicious ingredients

1075
00:51:54,620 --> 00:51:57,100
bundled up in an eight inch flour tortilla.

1076
00:51:57,100 --> 00:51:57,420
Stop.

1077
00:51:59,420 --> 00:52:01,500
To create a perfect bite every time.

1078
00:52:02,220 --> 00:52:04,780
In whose mouth is this a perfect bite?

1079
00:52:04,780 --> 00:52:05,420
Shrek?

1080
00:52:05,420 --> 00:52:09,820
The Fritos the Fritos chili cheese junior burger.

1081
00:52:09,820 --> 00:52:15,980
OK, so the name of the menu item is not actually apparently the Fritos Fritos chili cheese junior

1082
00:52:15,980 --> 00:52:19,660
burger, but I think it is very indicative of the person who ran this press release.

1083
00:52:19,660 --> 00:52:20,620
They looked at the name of it.

1084
00:52:20,620 --> 00:52:24,460
They think there's got to be some more Fritos in there somewhere.

1085
00:52:24,460 --> 00:52:25,340
It doesn't look right.

1086
00:52:25,340 --> 00:52:28,700
I want to put another Fritos at the beginning and see if that does it anyway.

1087
00:52:28,700 --> 00:52:31,180
The Fritos chili cheese junior burger is made with Fritos,

1088
00:52:31,820 --> 00:52:37,420
chili and melty cheddar cheese on top of juicy 100 percent beef patty.

1089
00:52:37,980 --> 00:52:45,580
I like the 100 percent beef patty because that indicates the person is really obsessed

1090
00:52:45,580 --> 00:52:48,780
with making sure their meat is all natural with no filler

1091
00:52:48,780 --> 00:52:51,900
or and they just are going to put some Fritos on top of it.

1092
00:52:54,140 --> 00:52:56,460
So sandwich between a soft bakery bun.

1093
00:52:56,460 --> 00:52:57,580
Cool bakery you got there.

1094
00:52:58,140 --> 00:53:00,140
What are you going to use the buns for?

1095
00:53:00,140 --> 00:53:06,060
Well, I'm going to slop some chips in there and then some other trash and sell it for a dollar.

1096
00:53:06,060 --> 00:53:06,700
I don't know.

1097
00:53:06,700 --> 00:53:07,980
I'm not a very good baker.

1098
00:53:09,500 --> 00:53:11,580
My father is very disappointed in me.

1099
00:53:11,580 --> 00:53:16,780
And you can amp up a Sonic classic by creating one more option

1100
00:53:16,780 --> 00:53:19,740
by adding Fritos to the chili cheese coney.

1101
00:53:19,740 --> 00:53:20,860
That's right, folks.

1102
00:53:20,860 --> 00:53:23,660
You can go fucking off menu and just be like,

1103
00:53:23,660 --> 00:53:25,260
is there anything else you can put Fritos in?

1104
00:53:25,980 --> 00:53:28,060
Because I'm crazy about these little corn chips.

1105
00:53:29,180 --> 00:53:29,980
So here's the quote.

1106
00:53:30,780 --> 00:53:34,940
It's from Scott Yulin, vice president of product innovation and development for Sonic.

1107
00:53:35,820 --> 00:53:41,660
Quote, the bold flavor combination of crispy Fritos with mouthwatering chili

1108
00:53:41,660 --> 00:53:47,740
and melty cheese is both incredibly classic and unique at the same time.

1109
00:53:49,100 --> 00:53:50,540
Hey, Scott, what are we doing here?

1110
00:53:50,540 --> 00:53:51,340
What are we playing at?

1111
00:53:52,220 --> 00:53:54,460
Scott, what are we doing?

1112
00:53:56,140 --> 00:54:00,780
Adding quote, adding the uniquely delicious and salty bite of Fritos.

1113
00:54:03,180 --> 00:54:05,180
They're fucking Fritos.

1114
00:54:05,180 --> 00:54:12,300
Adding the Fritos flavored Fritos from Fritos that you know as Fritos.

1115
00:54:13,180 --> 00:54:14,620
Dylan, it's Scott.

1116
00:54:14,620 --> 00:54:15,980
I need you to come into my office.

1117
00:54:15,980 --> 00:54:20,860
But when you come, bring every word if anyone's ever written about Fritos,

1118
00:54:20,860 --> 00:54:24,940
because I need to find some other things to say about Fritos.

1119
00:54:24,940 --> 00:54:27,580
I'm not an expert, but the way that sentence is constructed,

1120
00:54:27,580 --> 00:54:33,260
it does say uniquely something and, but that would be uniquely salty taste of Fritos.

1121
00:54:33,260 --> 00:54:36,620
Like you would taste the salt of Fritos and be like, that's a salt I've never had before.

1122
00:54:36,620 --> 00:54:38,220
Is this Himalayan sea salt?

1123
00:54:38,220 --> 00:54:39,340
This is incredible.

1124
00:54:39,900 --> 00:54:43,660
The uniquely salty bite of Fritos, chili and cheese

1125
00:54:44,220 --> 00:54:46,940
was something many had had to hack menus to get.

1126
00:54:48,460 --> 00:54:50,460
Thank you, you brave pioneers.

1127
00:54:51,820 --> 00:54:52,380
And now people-

1128
00:54:52,380 --> 00:54:54,620
Some even had to bring their own Fritos.

1129
00:54:54,620 --> 00:54:55,660
Unbelievable.

1130
00:54:55,660 --> 00:55:01,980
People can, now people can order their faves in three craveable ways, right from their cars.

1131
00:55:01,980 --> 00:55:04,620
That's it, that's it.

1132
00:55:04,620 --> 00:55:07,660
You got to, they want you to eat this in your car.

1133
00:55:08,460 --> 00:55:13,420
That's the same one that you're going to drive your spouse to when they deliver your first child

1134
00:55:14,060 --> 00:55:17,500
and you're going to eat a Frito pie in there on a hamburger,

1135
00:55:17,500 --> 00:55:20,780
on French fries, on a corn dog, on a milkshake.

1136
00:55:20,780 --> 00:55:22,540
That you're going to eat that in your own car.

1137
00:55:23,340 --> 00:55:25,980
And, you know, starting at just 99 cents,

1138
00:55:25,980 --> 00:55:30,860
guests can order the Sonic Fritos chili pie and Fritos chili cheese junior wrap

1139
00:55:30,860 --> 00:55:32,300
along with the Fritos.

1140
00:55:33,020 --> 00:55:36,380
Okay, now here it says Fritos Fritos chili cheese junior burger.

1141
00:55:36,380 --> 00:55:38,300
Okay, that's two out of three folks.

1142
00:55:38,300 --> 00:55:41,660
It's called the Fritos Fritos chili cheese junior burger.

1143
00:55:41,660 --> 00:55:45,180
That's starting at 199 while supplies last.

1144
00:55:45,180 --> 00:55:47,980
Get in there and get those three craveable-

1145
00:55:47,980 --> 00:55:53,020
Hey folks, if you ever find yourself as part of your job writing the word craveable,

1146
00:55:54,540 --> 00:55:55,100
go home.

1147
00:55:56,940 --> 00:55:58,700
Donate everything you own to charity.

1148
00:55:58,700 --> 00:56:02,620
And walk the world doing good for others.

1149
00:56:02,620 --> 00:56:04,780
Because you have so much to atone for.

1150
00:56:06,380 --> 00:56:08,140
You have to start now.

1151
00:56:08,140 --> 00:56:11,820
You've gone horribly awry and you have to fix it all right now.

1152
00:56:12,700 --> 00:56:15,660
And anyway, that's the latest and greatest from Sonic.

1153
00:56:15,660 --> 00:56:16,460
They talk-

1154
00:56:16,460 --> 00:56:17,260
Thank you for listening.

1155
00:56:17,260 --> 00:56:18,780
Thank you, Sonic.

1156
00:56:18,780 --> 00:56:21,180
They talk a lot in there about the different ways

1157
00:56:21,900 --> 00:56:25,340
without ever saying you could just order some Fritos if you want them.

1158
00:56:25,340 --> 00:56:27,180
What if I just want a bag full of Fritos?

1159
00:56:27,180 --> 00:56:32,060
Tim shits. Maybe you could buy a bag of Fritos and put them on wherever the fuck you want.

1160
00:56:32,060 --> 00:56:34,940
Like you don't have to come to Sonic to get Fritos.

1161
00:56:35,660 --> 00:56:37,260
Just bring your own Fritos.

1162
00:56:37,820 --> 00:56:39,660
Let's do the audience questions.

1163
00:56:39,660 --> 00:56:40,140
How about that?

1164
00:56:40,140 --> 00:56:40,780
Yeah.

1165
00:56:40,780 --> 00:56:41,280
Do not-

1166
00:56:42,460 --> 00:56:43,420
Let's get those highlights up.

1167
00:56:43,420 --> 00:56:43,900
Don't get up.

1168
00:56:43,900 --> 00:56:45,100
We have a new way of doing this.

1169
00:56:45,100 --> 00:56:45,900
I don't say-

1170
00:56:45,900 --> 00:56:49,100
This is our first show in Denver, which by the way, sorry.

1171
00:56:51,900 --> 00:56:52,940
You should come sooner.

1172
00:56:52,940 --> 00:56:53,980
Yeah, we should come here soon.

1173
00:56:53,980 --> 00:56:54,860
You guys are great.

1174
00:56:54,860 --> 00:56:58,060
Hey Nick, what do you do with bread, pal?

1175
00:56:58,060 --> 00:56:58,620
Okay.

1176
00:56:58,620 --> 00:57:03,420
So I take about sometimes four to five slices of bread

1177
00:57:03,420 --> 00:57:09,580
and just like mash them up into a ball and just eat it like it's a big apple.

1178
00:57:09,580 --> 00:57:09,900
Yes.

1179
00:57:12,700 --> 00:57:12,940
The problem is-

1180
00:57:12,940 --> 00:57:16,060
I saw someone behind you enthusiastically like, yes.

1181
00:57:16,700 --> 00:57:17,740
Good, yes.

1182
00:57:17,740 --> 00:57:17,980
Good.

1183
00:57:21,740 --> 00:57:22,620
Wait, and what's the-

1184
00:57:22,620 --> 00:57:24,780
That's just a statement of fact of what you do.

1185
00:57:25,500 --> 00:57:27,020
What do you need our help with?

1186
00:57:28,220 --> 00:57:29,580
How do I not do that?

1187
00:57:29,580 --> 00:57:30,140
Yeah, why do you-

1188
00:57:30,140 --> 00:57:30,460
Okay.

1189
00:57:32,460 --> 00:57:37,100
I did this when I was in elementary school and you get the school rolls.

1190
00:57:37,100 --> 00:57:37,500
Oh yeah.

1191
00:57:37,500 --> 00:57:42,060
I would take the bread meat out of the husk

1192
00:57:43,100 --> 00:57:46,300
and I would roll the bread meat back into its dough state.

1193
00:57:46,300 --> 00:57:49,980
You're returning it ashes to ashes, dough to dough.

1194
00:57:49,980 --> 00:57:53,820
Returning the bread to its dough state and then I would eat it in that state.

1195
00:57:53,820 --> 00:57:54,620
And you know what?

1196
00:57:55,180 --> 00:57:55,900
It was good.

1197
00:57:55,900 --> 00:57:56,380
It was good.

1198
00:57:56,380 --> 00:57:58,220
It was like a little gumball of bread.

1199
00:57:59,100 --> 00:58:01,740
Nick, do you often find yourself like rolling the bread out thinking like,

1200
00:58:01,740 --> 00:58:03,020
what am I doing?

1201
00:58:03,020 --> 00:58:03,500
No.

1202
00:58:04,700 --> 00:58:09,580
It's a process because most of the time I kind of just peel off the crust first

1203
00:58:09,580 --> 00:58:11,180
and then eat that and then-

1204
00:58:11,180 --> 00:58:12,540
Oh Jesus Christ, man.

1205
00:58:12,540 --> 00:58:13,580
Okay, come on.

1206
00:58:13,580 --> 00:58:15,340
No, I won't fucking come on.

1207
00:58:15,340 --> 00:58:16,780
You come on.

1208
00:58:16,780 --> 00:58:18,780
Back to the light of reason.

1209
00:58:18,780 --> 00:58:19,340
Of reason.

1210
00:58:20,220 --> 00:58:20,700
Can I-

1211
00:58:20,700 --> 00:58:22,140
But like, it's-

1212
00:58:22,140 --> 00:58:23,420
What do you like about this?

1213
00:58:23,420 --> 00:58:24,540
It's chewier.

1214
00:58:25,900 --> 00:58:26,780
It's chewier.

1215
00:58:26,780 --> 00:58:27,660
Okay, wait.

1216
00:58:28,780 --> 00:58:30,620
It's all the same bread, right?

1217
00:58:30,620 --> 00:58:32,220
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

1218
00:58:32,220 --> 00:58:35,740
In wadding it up, you've changed the-

1219
00:58:35,740 --> 00:58:37,340
Whose side are you on?

1220
00:58:37,340 --> 00:58:39,900
I'm turning over to Nick's side actually because I'm thinking about it.

1221
00:58:40,780 --> 00:58:44,060
Do you watch like Great British Bake Off whenever like Paul Hollywood-

1222
00:58:44,060 --> 00:58:45,740
Yeah, I do.

1223
00:58:45,740 --> 00:58:49,020
Whenever Paul Hollywood is like, this is leaden and stodgy.

1224
00:58:49,020 --> 00:58:52,540
You see that and you're like, fuck, send it over this way, Paul.

1225
00:58:52,540 --> 00:58:53,820
This has no air in it.

1226
00:58:53,820 --> 00:58:55,500
You didn't let it rise and you're like, yum, yum.

1227
00:58:55,500 --> 00:58:58,060
Give me some of that bad bread, Paul Hollywood.

1228
00:58:58,060 --> 00:59:02,940
I wish every once in a while Paul Hollywood would take four or five slices of the baker's

1229
00:59:02,940 --> 00:59:05,820
treat and roll into a ball and eat it like an apple.

1230
00:59:05,820 --> 00:59:07,340
With his big hands.

1231
00:59:07,340 --> 00:59:10,860
I can't really taste it unless I do it the traditional British way.

1232
00:59:13,100 --> 00:59:14,940
No, okay, hold on.

1233
00:59:14,940 --> 00:59:18,540
There's an element of this question where Nick is saying, how do I stop doing this?

1234
00:59:18,540 --> 00:59:19,740
And you're both like, nah.

1235
00:59:19,740 --> 00:59:21,420
Don't, dude, it's to chase your bliss.

1236
00:59:21,420 --> 00:59:24,060
The question wasn't, I do this and I love it.

1237
00:59:24,060 --> 00:59:25,180
How do I keep doing it?

1238
00:59:25,180 --> 00:59:28,860
I used to dip into the pepperoni bag in the refrigerator and pull some out and put it

1239
00:59:28,860 --> 00:59:30,700
in a single slice of white bread.

1240
00:59:30,700 --> 00:59:36,620
Then I would crush it in my fist like I was Thanos claiming a fucking reality gym.

1241
00:59:36,620 --> 00:59:38,780
And then I put that in the microwave for like 10 seconds.

1242
00:59:38,780 --> 00:59:42,060
I mean, I'm a pepperoni roll, but it's not, it's not, it's not.

1243
00:59:42,060 --> 00:59:48,380
I really don't think you should be giving me more fuel because I will do that.

1244
00:59:48,380 --> 00:59:49,740
No, this is great.

1245
00:59:49,740 --> 00:59:50,700
Fucking chase your bliss.

1246
00:59:50,700 --> 00:59:51,500
I'm serious, Nick.

1247
00:59:51,500 --> 00:59:52,380
Eat your bread.

1248
00:59:52,380 --> 00:59:53,020
Life's short.

1249
00:59:53,020 --> 00:59:55,900
If it makes you happy, fucking eat your bread the weird way you eat it.

1250
00:59:55,900 --> 00:59:57,260
Like a, like a.

1251
00:59:57,260 --> 00:59:58,300
I believe in you, Nick.

1252
00:59:59,260 --> 01:00:01,180
Sure, never give up.

1253
01:00:02,620 --> 01:00:03,340
Did that help?

1254
01:00:03,340 --> 01:00:03,900
Did that help?

1255
01:00:04,540 --> 01:00:04,860
Okay.

1256
01:00:04,860 --> 01:00:05,420
Yeah, sure.

1257
01:00:07,420 --> 01:00:07,980
Hi.

1258
01:00:07,980 --> 01:00:09,100
Hi, I'm Hannah.

1259
01:00:09,100 --> 01:00:10,540
Sorry I didn't put my name in the email.

1260
01:00:10,540 --> 01:00:16,380
Um, it's so a very important, uh, context for the question is that it's 2018 and that

1261
01:00:16,380 --> 01:00:20,780
will become very clear when you're an alien who found this in a like satellite, you never

1262
01:00:20,780 --> 01:00:21,100
know.

1263
01:00:21,100 --> 01:00:21,980
Like they might be.

1264
01:00:21,980 --> 01:00:27,900
Um, and so my mom works for the news and she, uh, is like a new media developer and

1265
01:00:27,900 --> 01:00:30,220
like works for like internet news and whatever.

1266
01:00:30,220 --> 01:00:35,420
She's like big and important, but, uh, so like in her work, she's very like new content,

1267
01:00:35,420 --> 01:00:35,900
whatever.

1268
01:00:35,900 --> 01:00:41,180
And then in her home life, she in the year 2018 still uses AOL as a web browser.

1269
01:00:43,180 --> 01:00:48,060
And I honestly didn't know that was a thing that was still like you could physically do.

1270
01:00:48,060 --> 01:00:51,580
Like I thought that they had sort of, uh, I don't know.

1271
01:00:51,580 --> 01:00:54,380
There's one person still at the other end of the computer.

1272
01:00:54,380 --> 01:00:55,180
Like I'll check.

1273
01:00:55,180 --> 01:00:56,220
And then they Google it.

1274
01:00:58,140 --> 01:00:58,780
I got her.

1275
01:00:58,780 --> 01:01:01,900
She's on the internet today and I've stood over while she's, you know, like in college

1276
01:01:01,900 --> 01:01:06,140
and whatever now and like trying to like load any webpage, but it's like, you know, Hey,

1277
01:01:06,140 --> 01:01:07,820
let's look at getting your health insurance.

1278
01:01:07,820 --> 01:01:12,620
And I'll be like leaning over her shoulder, waiting for like a full minute for a webpage

1279
01:01:12,620 --> 01:01:13,100
to load.

1280
01:01:13,100 --> 01:01:15,820
Cause it's on AOL in the year 2018.

1281
01:01:15,820 --> 01:01:21,260
And I've, I've tried to be like, Hey mom, Linda, uh, here's Google Chrome or any other

1282
01:01:21,260 --> 01:01:21,820
web browser.

1283
01:01:21,820 --> 01:01:22,300
Sure.

1284
01:01:22,300 --> 01:01:22,620
Okay.

1285
01:01:22,620 --> 01:01:28,780
So my question is how do I get my mom who is again, a professional like internet journalist

1286
01:01:28,780 --> 01:01:32,940
to stop using AOL as a web browser in the year 2018?

1287
01:01:32,940 --> 01:01:34,220
I mean, it's unfathomable.

1288
01:01:34,220 --> 01:01:34,860
It's unfathomable.

1289
01:01:34,860 --> 01:01:37,100
Can you just snap the disc over your leg?

1290
01:01:40,620 --> 01:01:41,820
Here's the thing though.

1291
01:01:41,820 --> 01:01:44,140
It's already like, there's no more disc.

1292
01:01:44,140 --> 01:01:45,180
It's already installed.

1293
01:01:45,180 --> 01:01:46,940
Like I could uninstall it from the computer.

1294
01:01:46,940 --> 01:01:49,020
She's got an AOL dev kit from.

1295
01:01:49,020 --> 01:01:49,740
I guess.

1296
01:01:50,460 --> 01:01:51,180
All right.

1297
01:01:51,180 --> 01:01:52,540
I don't know how to get it off.

1298
01:01:52,540 --> 01:01:57,420
Why don't you download Google Chrome, but then set the homepage to AOL.com.

1299
01:01:57,420 --> 01:02:01,660
Cause then she'll still get all the great content that she craves.

1300
01:02:02,460 --> 01:02:08,860
Folks, speaking as someone who until, uh, 2012 was employed by AOL, fucking a lot of

1301
01:02:08,860 --> 01:02:10,620
people go to AOL.com.

1302
01:02:10,620 --> 01:02:15,500
It's a kind of a gross number of people definitely go to AOL.com as her home page.

1303
01:02:15,500 --> 01:02:18,860
We're talking about the AOL web browser, which is a whole nother kettle of fish.

1304
01:02:18,860 --> 01:02:21,420
But I'm saying AOL is a popular outlet.

1305
01:02:21,420 --> 01:02:23,260
They got a lot of great content.

1306
01:02:23,260 --> 01:02:24,220
That's the first thing.

1307
01:02:24,220 --> 01:02:27,580
Okay, maybe just tell her like AOL closed.

1308
01:02:30,140 --> 01:02:31,020
Unplug the router.

1309
01:02:35,340 --> 01:02:38,220
You should start by installing Netscape Navigator.

1310
01:02:38,220 --> 01:02:40,540
Yeah, you got a bill.

1311
01:02:40,540 --> 01:02:42,540
You can't jump right into the deep end.

1312
01:02:42,540 --> 01:02:43,500
You're right, you're right, you're right.

1313
01:02:44,540 --> 01:02:45,180
Uh, yeah.

1314
01:02:45,180 --> 01:02:50,940
And it's still, if anyone's curious, it still looks the same as it did in 1999.

1315
01:02:50,940 --> 01:02:56,220
I'll tell you, sometimes when I do Google something, I get so many results back, it

1316
01:02:56,220 --> 01:02:56,860
scares me.

1317
01:02:56,860 --> 01:03:03,180
I would love to just type in the keyword, new applesauce, and it will show me the one

1318
01:03:03,180 --> 01:03:03,580
website.

1319
01:03:03,580 --> 01:03:05,100
It's like, here's the newest applesauce.

1320
01:03:05,100 --> 01:03:06,140
Come get it.

1321
01:03:06,140 --> 01:03:11,340
I do, I do miss the days where there was a man named Jeeves who would bring me one thing.

1322
01:03:11,340 --> 01:03:14,540
Maybe it wasn't the one thing I wanted, but I wasn't overwhelmed.

1323
01:03:14,540 --> 01:03:14,940
Yeah.

1324
01:03:14,940 --> 01:03:19,340
Now Travis has to go to Fiverr and try to find somebody named Jeeves to Google shit

1325
01:03:19,340 --> 01:03:20,860
for him.

1326
01:03:20,860 --> 01:03:24,460
At AOL, you could join a chat room for people that like sports.

1327
01:03:26,700 --> 01:03:28,220
Can you fucking imagine?

1328
01:03:29,900 --> 01:03:32,460
Football, basketball, whatever.

1329
01:03:32,460 --> 01:03:33,580
Any sport.

1330
01:03:33,580 --> 01:03:36,140
They just join and talk about sports.

1331
01:03:36,140 --> 01:03:37,420
Maybe that's really what she's there for.

1332
01:03:37,420 --> 01:03:40,860
Maybe she just likes sports, but she doesn't want to get too specific about it.

1333
01:03:40,860 --> 01:03:41,420
So she's gotta be on the sports chat room.

1334
01:03:41,420 --> 01:03:42,460
It's entirely possible.

1335
01:03:42,460 --> 01:03:44,940
I'm gonna give the same answer to the bread monster.

1336
01:03:46,220 --> 01:03:47,420
Just let her chase her place.

1337
01:03:47,420 --> 01:03:49,740
It sounds cool if she's having it.

1338
01:03:49,740 --> 01:03:50,700
Seems like she's having it.

1339
01:03:50,700 --> 01:03:54,540
Honestly, can I ask everybody in the room who's been having a good chuckle?

1340
01:03:55,580 --> 01:03:56,140
Take a beep.

1341
01:03:56,860 --> 01:03:59,500
Think about your experience with the internet.

1342
01:03:59,500 --> 01:04:02,700
And if you couldn't put that fucking genie back in the bottle, would you not?

1343
01:04:03,260 --> 01:04:06,780
If you could un-internet yourself, you probably would right now.

1344
01:04:07,420 --> 01:04:10,540
Let's let her live like Charlie Bucket.

1345
01:04:10,540 --> 01:04:15,260
Have one more dream before we wake her up and tell her all the golden tickets are gone.

1346
01:04:15,260 --> 01:04:16,540
Eh?

1347
01:04:16,540 --> 01:04:17,420
Does that help?

1348
01:04:17,420 --> 01:04:18,220
Yeah, it helps a ton.

1349
01:04:18,220 --> 01:04:18,700
Thank you so much.

1350
01:04:18,700 --> 01:04:19,020
Thank you.

1351
01:04:19,020 --> 01:04:19,660
My pleasure.

1352
01:04:19,660 --> 01:04:20,300
Let's kick.

1353
01:04:20,300 --> 01:04:20,860
And hello.

1354
01:04:21,820 --> 01:04:22,220
Hi.

1355
01:04:22,220 --> 01:04:23,740
Hi, who's you?

1356
01:04:23,740 --> 01:04:24,380
I am Eric.

1357
01:04:24,940 --> 01:04:26,060
Hello, Eric.

1358
01:04:26,060 --> 01:04:27,100
You's Eric.

1359
01:04:27,100 --> 01:04:33,340
So I was in a real big hurry right out of work, and I needed to get to the mechanic

1360
01:04:33,900 --> 01:04:34,700
who had my car.

1361
01:04:36,060 --> 01:04:36,620
And the city-

1362
01:04:36,620 --> 01:04:38,220
You getting some fucking NOS?

1363
01:04:38,780 --> 01:04:39,280
Yeah.

1364
01:04:40,140 --> 01:04:41,100
It was an upgrade.

1365
01:04:41,100 --> 01:04:46,620
No, I needed to get there quick, and the city had just got these electric scooters that,

1366
01:04:46,620 --> 01:04:53,260
you know, and I thought this would be a real cool way to finish, or like to start my evening.

1367
01:04:53,260 --> 01:04:55,260
Thought no one ever.

1368
01:04:57,260 --> 01:04:58,300
There's something new.

1369
01:05:01,100 --> 01:05:02,620
I ate it.

1370
01:05:02,620 --> 01:05:03,100
Yeah.

1371
01:05:03,100 --> 01:05:03,900
You ate the scooter?

1372
01:05:03,900 --> 01:05:04,940
You ate the whole scooter?

1373
01:05:05,820 --> 01:05:07,020
You did it so bad.

1374
01:05:07,020 --> 01:05:07,740
That's inadvisable.

1375
01:05:07,740 --> 01:05:09,340
They tell you that right in the app.

1376
01:05:09,340 --> 01:05:12,620
They tell you that right in the app to not eat it.

1377
01:05:12,620 --> 01:05:14,220
I know it looks delicious, but please.

1378
01:05:14,780 --> 01:05:15,820
It's called a lime.

1379
01:05:17,900 --> 01:05:19,020
All right, listen.

1380
01:05:19,020 --> 01:05:21,580
It's different things in different cities, but Travis is right.

1381
01:05:21,580 --> 01:05:23,500
It's called a lime in some cities.

1382
01:05:23,500 --> 01:05:26,140
There was a great joke that would have played in a city.

1383
01:05:26,140 --> 01:05:28,780
In some cities, it's called a bird, which you could stretch.

1384
01:05:28,780 --> 01:05:29,100
Sorry.

1385
01:05:29,100 --> 01:05:29,740
Okay.

1386
01:05:29,740 --> 01:05:32,220
So you, oh, you crashed.

1387
01:05:32,220 --> 01:05:34,380
Yeah, I crashed the scooter.

1388
01:05:34,380 --> 01:05:34,860
Oh, no.

1389
01:05:35,980 --> 01:05:37,260
Was the scooter okay?

1390
01:05:37,980 --> 01:05:39,100
The scooter was fine.

1391
01:05:39,100 --> 01:05:39,900
Oh.

1392
01:05:39,900 --> 01:05:42,860
I had gotten probably 11 feet.

1393
01:05:44,700 --> 01:05:45,580
Holy shit.

1394
01:05:45,580 --> 01:05:49,420
Now, I need to hear a lot more about the question.

1395
01:05:49,420 --> 01:05:52,460
I do want to say it's quite a relief that we're going to have one tonight

1396
01:05:52,460 --> 01:05:54,540
where we're not just affirming your life choices.

1397
01:05:55,900 --> 01:05:57,660
I want to hear more about the big spill.

1398
01:06:00,060 --> 01:06:01,580
Take it into slow mode for us.

1399
01:06:02,620 --> 01:06:04,460
How does it feel?

1400
01:06:04,460 --> 01:06:06,780
This is radio AFV for me.

1401
01:06:06,780 --> 01:06:09,100
I am loving it.

1402
01:06:09,100 --> 01:06:09,580
Well.

1403
01:06:09,580 --> 01:06:10,700
You're okay, though, right?

1404
01:06:10,700 --> 01:06:11,020
Yeah.

1405
01:06:11,020 --> 01:06:12,220
Okay, then I'm loving it.

1406
01:06:12,220 --> 01:06:12,380
Yeah.

1407
01:06:15,180 --> 01:06:20,860
There is no way that someone at my work did not see it.

1408
01:06:20,860 --> 01:06:21,100
Yeah.

1409
01:06:21,740 --> 01:06:21,980
Okay.

1410
01:06:22,620 --> 01:06:25,900
Was it a cool fall where you like fell and landed like...

1411
01:06:26,540 --> 01:06:28,380
On your side on like a sexy pose?

1412
01:06:29,900 --> 01:06:31,900
Maybe that's what it looked like.

1413
01:06:33,020 --> 01:06:34,460
What did it feel like?

1414
01:06:34,460 --> 01:06:34,780
Yeah.

1415
01:06:34,780 --> 01:06:40,140
Yeah, so I was in a hurry, so I had gone as quickly as I could,

1416
01:06:40,140 --> 01:06:41,180
as quickly as I could.

1417
01:06:41,740 --> 01:06:43,500
And so I...

1418
01:06:44,620 --> 01:06:46,780
The scooter stopped and I did not.

1419
01:06:47,500 --> 01:06:47,740
Right.

1420
01:06:47,740 --> 01:06:48,380
Sure.

1421
01:06:48,380 --> 01:06:52,060
And I hit in like an attempted sexy slide

1422
01:06:53,500 --> 01:06:59,580
and kind of skid across the pavement and lost my pants and...

1423
01:06:59,580 --> 01:07:11,260
Fuck, yes!

1424
01:07:11,260 --> 01:07:12,300
In a cool way?

1425
01:07:14,700 --> 01:07:15,740
Kind of a sexy...

1426
01:07:16,460 --> 01:07:19,420
There's still a benefit, a shadow of a chance.

1427
01:07:19,420 --> 01:07:21,020
It was still a cool crash.

1428
01:07:23,260 --> 01:07:24,780
It took all my pants.

1429
01:07:24,780 --> 01:07:25,020
Yeah.

1430
01:07:25,980 --> 01:07:26,540
Claimed your pants.

1431
01:07:26,540 --> 01:07:28,620
It took all my pants.

1432
01:07:28,620 --> 01:07:29,100
Yeah.

1433
01:07:29,100 --> 01:07:31,260
The street just a mouth opened up.

1434
01:07:32,940 --> 01:07:33,660
Mine now!

1435
01:07:34,940 --> 01:07:36,540
Your pants belong to the city.

1436
01:07:38,060 --> 01:07:42,140
I would sell one of my children into maritime service to watch this happen.

1437
01:07:45,660 --> 01:07:49,180
So, but it sounds like some of your co-workers did enjoy the show.

1438
01:07:50,620 --> 01:07:55,260
I can't see a way that someone didn't see it.

1439
01:07:55,260 --> 01:08:00,540
So you're wondering if we have a job for you in the My Brother, My Brother and Me corporate ladder?

1440
01:08:01,740 --> 01:08:03,340
Yeah, part of it.

1441
01:08:03,340 --> 01:08:04,380
What are your qualifications?

1442
01:08:04,380 --> 01:08:07,020
Because I know riding a scooter good is not one of them.

1443
01:08:09,420 --> 01:08:11,020
You are okay though, right?

1444
01:08:11,020 --> 01:08:12,140
I'm good, yeah.

1445
01:08:12,140 --> 01:08:12,860
Okay, cool.

1446
01:08:14,460 --> 01:08:15,660
How are your pants?

1447
01:08:15,660 --> 01:08:15,980
Stop.

1448
01:08:17,100 --> 01:08:18,300
What is your question?

1449
01:08:18,300 --> 01:08:20,460
Because I can't uncrash that scooter for you.

1450
01:08:20,460 --> 01:08:26,780
How do I sort through my co-workers and find out who saw?

1451
01:08:30,220 --> 01:08:33,660
I would like to see if any of them have burst blood vessels from laughing.

1452
01:08:36,940 --> 01:08:40,460
There, there was peepus.

1453
01:08:40,460 --> 01:08:49,420
They're like, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait,

1454
01:08:49,420 --> 01:08:50,540
wait, wait.

1455
01:08:53,020 --> 01:08:54,780
So when you say took all your pants.

1456
01:08:55,660 --> 01:08:59,500
Yeah, yeah, no, all of the pants that I had.

1457
01:08:59,500 --> 01:09:02,300
Okay, hey, hey, hey, hey.

1458
01:09:03,500 --> 01:09:06,460
Do you remember when I said the thing about how there's still a shadow of a chance that

1459
01:09:06,460 --> 01:09:07,420
it was a cool crash?

1460
01:09:12,140 --> 01:09:13,580
Listen, I'm not, I'm not judging you.

1461
01:09:13,580 --> 01:09:15,260
This question's been going for a while.

1462
01:09:15,260 --> 01:09:17,740
You really made us wait for that big reveal.

1463
01:09:17,740 --> 01:09:20,940
But you didn't make your co-workers wait, which is great.

1464
01:09:20,940 --> 01:09:22,940
Well, huh?

1465
01:09:22,940 --> 01:09:24,140
Maybe you need a sketch artist.

1466
01:09:24,140 --> 01:09:25,660
Like, have you seen this peepus?

1467
01:09:27,660 --> 01:09:28,780
That ain't going to do it.

1468
01:09:28,780 --> 01:09:34,220
Hey, have you considered just trying to make eye contact with your co-workers one at a

1469
01:09:34,220 --> 01:09:34,780
time?

1470
01:09:35,820 --> 01:09:37,020
That seems foolproof.

1471
01:09:38,220 --> 01:09:39,500
So where do you work now?

1472
01:09:43,020 --> 01:09:45,740
How long were you on the ground before you got up?

1473
01:09:45,740 --> 01:09:46,780
Different stage.

1474
01:09:46,780 --> 01:09:49,820
Different state or just a different city or what?

1475
01:09:52,220 --> 01:09:54,700
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1476
01:09:54,700 --> 01:09:56,060
This is a cool story.

1477
01:09:56,060 --> 01:09:57,900
You're going to fucking know who saw.

1478
01:09:59,580 --> 01:10:00,700
In your heart, you know.

1479
01:10:02,460 --> 01:10:08,140
What you need is a way of making it just like foolproof where if somebody can't meet your

1480
01:10:08,140 --> 01:10:15,100
gaze, you just like nod at them in a way to say like, you saw it and then they'll nod

1481
01:10:15,100 --> 01:10:16,220
back and then you'll know.

1482
01:10:16,220 --> 01:10:18,060
Maybe you need like them to sign a...

1483
01:10:18,860 --> 01:10:22,380
This is above HR's head is the problem.

1484
01:10:26,380 --> 01:10:29,900
You must quit this job.

1485
01:10:30,780 --> 01:10:32,220
There's no jokes.

1486
01:10:32,220 --> 01:10:35,500
Where jokes left, jokes left the room.

1487
01:10:35,500 --> 01:10:39,340
Because quit would imply that you went back to turn in some paperwork or something.

1488
01:10:39,340 --> 01:10:41,740
You can't go back anymore.

1489
01:10:41,740 --> 01:10:42,300
I got it.

1490
01:10:43,100 --> 01:10:43,660
I got it.

1491
01:10:44,380 --> 01:10:44,940
I got it.

1492
01:10:44,940 --> 01:10:45,660
I got it.

1493
01:10:45,660 --> 01:10:48,380
You're going to have to do this again inside the office.

1494
01:10:49,100 --> 01:10:52,700
No, listen, this accomplishes two things.

1495
01:10:52,700 --> 01:10:54,620
One, whoever...

1496
01:10:55,420 --> 01:10:58,140
There's going to be two tiers of laughter at this point.

1497
01:10:58,140 --> 01:11:00,780
People laughing very hard and then people laughing kind of hard.

1498
01:11:00,780 --> 01:11:03,180
The people on that lower tier definitely saw it the first time.

1499
01:11:05,180 --> 01:11:09,580
The other benefit is now you will know that everyone has seen it and you don't have to

1500
01:11:09,580 --> 01:11:10,080
swear.

1501
01:11:11,020 --> 01:11:12,540
That's how you start to rebuild.

1502
01:11:12,540 --> 01:11:15,100
Does that help?

1503
01:11:15,100 --> 01:11:15,580
Yeah.

1504
01:11:15,580 --> 01:11:15,980
Thank you.

1505
01:11:15,980 --> 01:11:16,460
Excellent.

1506
01:11:16,460 --> 01:11:17,180
Glad we can help.

1507
01:11:18,220 --> 01:11:18,700
Last one.

1508
01:11:18,700 --> 01:11:18,940
All right.

1509
01:11:18,940 --> 01:11:19,260
Yeah.

1510
01:11:19,260 --> 01:11:19,740
Colin.

1511
01:11:22,300 --> 01:11:23,660
Hello, Colin.

1512
01:11:23,660 --> 01:11:24,460
Yes, Colin.

1513
01:11:24,460 --> 01:11:25,100
Hi, Colin.

1514
01:11:26,460 --> 01:11:27,820
So what happened?

1515
01:11:27,820 --> 01:11:29,900
We were today at the Denver Zoo.

1516
01:11:29,900 --> 01:11:30,620
Hell yeah.

1517
01:11:30,620 --> 01:11:31,340
Which was great.

1518
01:11:31,340 --> 01:11:32,140
How is it?

1519
01:11:32,140 --> 01:11:33,740
It was super awesome.

1520
01:11:33,740 --> 01:11:34,300
Cool.

1521
01:11:34,300 --> 01:11:34,940
I'd never been.

1522
01:11:34,940 --> 01:11:36,780
Anyway, lots of great animals.

1523
01:11:36,780 --> 01:11:39,820
So it's the goal.

1524
01:11:39,820 --> 01:11:42,060
Like that's what they go for there.

1525
01:11:42,060 --> 01:11:42,700
They got there.

1526
01:11:43,820 --> 01:11:46,460
So we were in the tropical exhibit with all the snakes.

1527
01:11:46,460 --> 01:11:49,340
And when we came outside, there's all the strollers they had parked there because you

1528
01:11:49,340 --> 01:11:50,300
can have the strollers inside.

1529
01:11:51,820 --> 01:11:52,700
Of the snake exhibit.

1530
01:11:52,700 --> 01:11:54,460
I like that policy a lot.

1531
01:11:54,460 --> 01:11:55,820
Well, no, the babies were inside.

1532
01:11:55,820 --> 01:11:57,020
Just can't have the strollers.

1533
01:11:57,020 --> 01:11:57,980
Oh, OK.

1534
01:11:57,980 --> 01:12:00,140
So there's empty strollers just lined up there.

1535
01:12:00,140 --> 01:12:06,140
So we walk out and the stroller nearest the door, I see that there is a squirrel tail protruding

1536
01:12:06,140 --> 01:12:09,100
from the bag of this stroller.

1537
01:12:09,100 --> 01:12:10,540
And I say, oh, neat.

1538
01:12:10,540 --> 01:12:11,340
A squirrel, whatever.

1539
01:12:11,340 --> 01:12:15,660
And then moments later, the squirrel leaps out and has in its mouth a Ziploc baggy with

1540
01:12:15,660 --> 01:12:17,980
half what I think was a peanut butter and jelly sandwich.

1541
01:12:17,980 --> 01:12:18,460
Nice.

1542
01:12:19,660 --> 01:12:21,420
That's a dream if you're a squirrel.

1543
01:12:21,420 --> 01:12:22,220
Sure, they love that.

1544
01:12:22,220 --> 01:12:23,820
The squirrel was having a great time.

1545
01:12:23,820 --> 01:12:26,460
So and then I was sort of watching the squirrel like, oh, is he going to get in?

1546
01:12:26,460 --> 01:12:29,260
And my first instinct was, should I help the squirrel open the bag?

1547
01:12:29,260 --> 01:12:33,100
That didn't last very long, but that was sort of the first thought.

1548
01:12:33,100 --> 01:12:33,900
Sure.

1549
01:12:33,900 --> 01:12:39,020
But then the second thought was, should we wait and tell the people that own the stroller?

1550
01:12:39,020 --> 01:12:44,220
And I guess this is the question, is there an etiquette to if you see a squirrel in like

1551
01:12:44,220 --> 01:12:50,380
somebody's baby bag, are you obligated to like leave a note or like tell them there

1552
01:12:50,380 --> 01:12:53,740
was a rodent in your baby bag you have to burn?

1553
01:12:54,700 --> 01:12:55,420
What do you do?

1554
01:12:55,420 --> 01:13:00,540
Yeah, my immediate gut check is that you have to have that conversation and make sure you

1555
01:13:00,540 --> 01:13:02,780
do it while I'm standing within earshot.

1556
01:13:02,780 --> 01:13:05,740
Because holy shit, I want to hear what that sounds like, bud.

1557
01:13:05,740 --> 01:13:10,140
I will tell you right now, I have a two-year-old who I love very much.

1558
01:13:10,140 --> 01:13:16,460
But if I walked out and found, I guess, a note on her stroller that said, I saw a squirrel

1559
01:13:16,460 --> 01:13:20,460
in your bag, I wouldn't know what to do with that information.

1560
01:13:21,020 --> 01:13:22,700
I guess throw the bag away.

1561
01:13:23,260 --> 01:13:27,500
Flip side, if I was going back to the car and my son was screaming for his peanut butter

1562
01:13:27,500 --> 01:13:31,980
jelly sandwich, I reached down there and some fucking furry rapscallion has taken it away.

1563
01:13:31,980 --> 01:13:33,900
I'm going to lose my fucking gourd.

1564
01:13:33,900 --> 01:13:35,820
So yes, I would like a heads up.

1565
01:13:35,820 --> 01:13:39,100
Well, and so what we ended up doing was sort of lurking in the area.

1566
01:13:39,100 --> 01:13:42,460
And as people with babies would walk by, we'd sort of watch and see if they were going to

1567
01:13:42,460 --> 01:13:43,660
walk towards the stroller.

1568
01:13:43,660 --> 01:13:45,580
Oh, God, that's a good look, bud.

1569
01:13:49,500 --> 01:13:51,820
So to my credit, I was there with my girlfriend.

1570
01:13:51,820 --> 01:13:53,660
So I at least sort of had that feminine buffer.

1571
01:13:53,660 --> 01:13:54,620
Sure, sure, sure, sure.

1572
01:13:54,620 --> 01:13:55,580
But we did realize quickly.

1573
01:13:55,580 --> 01:13:59,580
More of like a couple shopping than like a kidnapper.

1574
01:13:59,580 --> 01:14:04,380
All right, but we we did realize pretty not quickly enough, but eventually that we can't

1575
01:14:04,380 --> 01:14:06,620
just be the people hanging out by the strollers.

1576
01:14:06,620 --> 01:14:07,180
Right, right.

1577
01:14:07,180 --> 01:14:09,900
Yeah, we did go and look at the lions.

1578
01:14:09,900 --> 01:14:12,060
Hey, hey, Colin, tell me true.

1579
01:14:13,580 --> 01:14:18,460
When you went outside and you looked at the strollers and you saw a squirrel tail poking

1580
01:14:18,460 --> 01:14:21,580
out of one of them out of the bag, the storage bag in the back.

1581
01:14:21,580 --> 01:14:24,540
Did you have even for a little bit?

1582
01:14:24,540 --> 01:14:26,300
And don't be afraid if the answer is yes.

1583
01:14:26,300 --> 01:14:29,980
Did you have the thought of somebody's trying to steal squirrels from the zoo?

1584
01:14:34,380 --> 01:14:36,620
At the time, I was very in tune with the animals.

1585
01:14:36,620 --> 01:14:39,100
So it was like, I want this squirrel to succeed.

1586
01:14:39,100 --> 01:14:40,140
Yeah, I like that.

1587
01:14:40,140 --> 01:14:41,020
Uh, shit.

1588
01:14:42,060 --> 01:14:46,940
I mean, I'm glad that you didn't chase the scroll away because like you can't go to a

1589
01:14:46,940 --> 01:14:49,820
parent and say, hey, no big deal.

1590
01:14:49,820 --> 01:14:53,740
A squirrel ate that a little bit, but it should be fine.

1591
01:14:53,740 --> 01:14:54,780
I saved most of it.

1592
01:14:54,780 --> 01:14:57,100
I saved most of it, it should be fine to give to your child.

1593
01:14:57,100 --> 01:14:59,020
A squirrel only ate a little bit.

1594
01:14:59,020 --> 01:15:02,140
Well, part of what I wanted to hang around for just to see if the squirrel would hang

1595
01:15:02,140 --> 01:15:03,820
around so I could see if it would get into the bag.

1596
01:15:03,820 --> 01:15:05,740
I don't know if the squirrel got the sandwich.

1597
01:15:05,740 --> 01:15:06,620
Wait, hold on, Colin.

1598
01:15:06,620 --> 01:15:07,740
Are you afraid it gave up?

1599
01:15:08,860 --> 01:15:09,420
I don't know.

1600
01:15:09,420 --> 01:15:11,980
I don't know how trepidatious that squirrel was.

1601
01:15:11,980 --> 01:15:15,740
That's the closest that squirrel has ever been to pure happiness.

1602
01:15:15,740 --> 01:15:16,620
It's not going to quit.

1603
01:15:17,180 --> 01:15:20,140
I guarantee you, let me give you at least that bit of solace.

1604
01:15:20,860 --> 01:15:23,580
The squirrel got the sandwich, no question.

1605
01:15:23,580 --> 01:15:29,340
Even if it had to throw it out of a tree a bunch until the bag exploded, it got it.

1606
01:15:29,340 --> 01:15:30,380
It got the sandwich.

1607
01:15:30,380 --> 01:15:33,900
And his squirrel friends are looking at him like, just fucking give it up, Derek.

1608
01:15:33,900 --> 01:15:34,380
Damn.

1609
01:15:37,180 --> 01:15:41,740
Um, hey, I just decided, do not approach these parents.

1610
01:15:42,620 --> 01:15:43,340
There you go.

1611
01:15:43,340 --> 01:15:43,980
Thank you, Colin.

1612
01:15:43,980 --> 01:15:47,100
If I look for a sandwich and it's not there, I'll be like, oh, what an inconvenience.

1613
01:15:47,100 --> 01:15:50,860
If a stranger approaches me at the zoo while I'm with my kid and says, a squirrel got your

1614
01:15:50,860 --> 01:15:58,940
bag, I'm going to run away quite fast and dream about it for the rest of my life.

1615
01:16:00,540 --> 01:16:05,260
It sounds like you're covering up for a much worse thing you did, honestly.

1616
01:16:05,260 --> 01:16:06,780
That's how it sounds.

1617
01:16:06,780 --> 01:16:07,740
Does that help, Colin?

1618
01:16:07,740 --> 01:16:08,620
That helps very much.

1619
01:16:08,620 --> 01:16:09,020
Thank you.

1620
01:16:09,020 --> 01:16:09,980
It comes a little late.

1621
01:16:09,980 --> 01:16:13,740
I imagine this helped, but next time.

1622
01:16:13,740 --> 01:16:15,020
I know I did the right thing.

1623
01:16:15,020 --> 01:16:15,420
Good.

1624
01:16:15,420 --> 01:16:16,300
Thank you.

1625
01:16:16,300 --> 01:16:16,620
All right.

1626
01:16:16,620 --> 01:16:17,980
Can we bring the house lights back down?

1627
01:16:17,980 --> 01:16:19,660
We're going to watch out for those house lights out.

1628
01:16:19,660 --> 01:16:24,300
Folks, thank you so much for having us here in this beautiful city.

1629
01:16:24,300 --> 01:16:25,580
You've been so amazing.

1630
01:16:27,580 --> 01:16:34,540
Wanted to mention it's that giving time of year, and we ask every year that you are kind

1631
01:16:34,540 --> 01:16:38,620
enough to support our hometown of Huntington, West Virginia in helping to give the families

1632
01:16:38,620 --> 01:16:43,180
there a little bit nicer holiday season here in these candle nights.

1633
01:16:43,180 --> 01:16:46,780
It is more desirable than normal to give to charity.

1634
01:16:46,780 --> 01:16:53,740
So we have asked that you go to MBMBAMangels.com and claim some of the items there, or you can

1635
01:16:53,740 --> 01:16:58,140
just kick in some money to help give some folks a nice holiday season.

1636
01:16:58,140 --> 01:16:59,180
So please do that.

1637
01:16:59,180 --> 01:16:59,500
Thank you.

1638
01:16:59,500 --> 01:17:00,460
If you would be so kind.

1639
01:17:02,620 --> 01:17:06,460
Also, we hope that you've already grabbed them because we don't know how many are left,

1640
01:17:06,460 --> 01:17:09,500
but there are some really amazing posters.

1641
01:17:09,500 --> 01:17:11,660
Yeah, Anusha Syed did those, and they are great.

1642
01:17:11,660 --> 01:17:13,500
They're fucking so good.

1643
01:17:13,500 --> 01:17:14,460
Incredible.

1644
01:17:14,460 --> 01:17:20,860
Overall, I also want to say we have a graphic novel series based on our podcast, The Adventure

1645
01:17:20,860 --> 01:17:21,180
Zone.

1646
01:17:23,900 --> 01:17:24,540
Thank you.

1647
01:17:24,540 --> 01:17:30,220
You can go to TheAdventureZoneComic.com and pre-order book two, or order book one if you

1648
01:17:30,220 --> 01:17:32,300
haven't gotten it yet, TheAdventureZoneComic.com.

1649
01:17:32,300 --> 01:17:35,340
Yes, I want to thank the Well Theater.

1650
01:17:35,340 --> 01:17:38,940
It's so big, first of all, which is wild.

1651
01:17:38,940 --> 01:17:40,220
And nice.

1652
01:17:40,220 --> 01:17:45,100
It's very, very nice, but we walked out here for sound check and my stomach raised up into

1653
01:17:45,100 --> 01:17:47,500
my lungs out of fear, but you all have been great.

1654
01:17:47,500 --> 01:17:48,460
So thank you for that.

1655
01:17:49,100 --> 01:17:56,060
Thank you to our daddy for coming with us on tour and introducing us.

1656
01:17:57,180 --> 01:18:02,700
Thank you to Paul for all the help.

1657
01:18:02,700 --> 01:18:04,140
We could not do this without Paul.

1658
01:18:05,260 --> 01:18:09,660
Thank you to our families who came with us, and they're incredibly supportive and wonderful.

1659
01:18:09,660 --> 01:18:12,060
Especially with our incredible opening act.

1660
01:18:12,060 --> 01:18:14,540
Yes, thank you to Sawbones.

1661
01:18:14,540 --> 01:18:15,900
They're going places.

1662
01:18:15,900 --> 01:18:17,980
Don't forget to grab the Sawbones book.

1663
01:18:17,980 --> 01:18:19,100
Griffin, I'm ready.

1664
01:18:19,100 --> 01:18:21,020
Final Yahoo is sent in by Morgan Davey.

1665
01:18:21,020 --> 01:18:23,020
Keep it wavy, Morgan Davey.

1666
01:18:23,740 --> 01:18:29,340
It's by an anonymous Yahoo Answers user who I'm going to call Priebus.

1667
01:18:30,220 --> 01:18:30,540
Okay.

1668
01:18:31,340 --> 01:18:33,180
That's a weird name when you know what the question is.

1669
01:18:33,180 --> 01:18:36,700
Thank you for your bravery, Priebus, because Priebus asks,

1670
01:18:36,700 --> 01:18:39,260
Can I vape and still be a Republican?

1671
01:18:43,260 --> 01:18:44,380
My name is Justin McElroy.

1672
01:18:44,380 --> 01:18:45,420
I'm Travis McElroy.

1673
01:18:45,420 --> 01:18:46,460
I'm Griffin McElroy.

1674
01:18:46,460 --> 01:18:47,500
This has been My Brother, My Brother and Me.

1675
01:18:47,500 --> 01:19:07,500
Kiss your dad's square on the lips.

1676
01:19:18,220 --> 01:19:20,220
Come back to WKEP at night.

1677
01:19:20,220 --> 01:19:24,700
Up next, looks like we've got a PSA from local forest ranger Duck Newton.

1678
01:19:24,700 --> 01:19:25,900
Do I start now or?

1679
01:19:25,900 --> 01:19:27,100
Yeah, lean in, Duck.

1680
01:19:27,100 --> 01:19:27,660
Yeah, sorry.

1681
01:19:28,460 --> 01:19:31,340
Okay, I wanted to address the unfortunate situation that...

1682
01:19:32,540 --> 01:19:34,220
Okay, listen.

1683
01:19:34,860 --> 01:19:39,180
Two people, good people that I and a lot of y'all have known our whole lives are dead.

1684
01:19:39,180 --> 01:19:40,060
Torn to shreds by-

1685
01:19:40,060 --> 01:19:44,300
A savage, bloodthirsty beast that defies human comprehension.

1686
01:19:44,940 --> 01:19:47,020
If you'd like to know more, stop by the Kryptonomica.

1687
01:19:47,020 --> 01:19:48,860
Kepler's Premier Museum of the Macabre.

1688
01:19:48,860 --> 01:19:49,900
Just online with-

1689
01:19:49,900 --> 01:19:50,460
Come on.

1690
01:19:50,460 --> 01:19:53,260
We just wanted to warn y'all to beg you.

1691
01:19:53,260 --> 01:19:55,660
If you see one of those things out in the forest, don't fight.

1692
01:19:56,220 --> 01:19:57,420
Don't scream.

1693
01:19:57,420 --> 01:19:57,660
Run.

1694
01:19:58,220 --> 01:19:59,900
Run as far as you can.

1695
01:19:59,900 --> 01:20:01,020
Duck, it's almost midnight.

1696
01:20:01,020 --> 01:20:01,820
Listen, folks.

1697
01:20:01,820 --> 01:20:06,300
If you see anything, please go to TheLamplighter.org and let us know.

1698
01:20:06,300 --> 01:20:08,780
And get behind a locked door tonight.

1699
01:20:08,780 --> 01:20:09,980
Anything else we need to-

1700
01:20:09,980 --> 01:20:11,420
Oh, they're leaving.

1701
01:20:11,420 --> 01:20:18,460
Okay, well, that's TheLamplighter.org and stay safe out there, Kepler.
