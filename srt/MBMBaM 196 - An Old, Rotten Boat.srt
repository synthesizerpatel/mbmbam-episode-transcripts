1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:30,720
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:48,080
Hello, everyone. Welcome to my brother, my brother, mean advice show for the modern era.

6
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:52,240
I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy. I'm your middle brother, Travis McElroy.

7
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:58,080
I'm your babiest brother, Griffin McElroy. The countdown is on in just seven days.

8
00:00:58,080 --> 00:01:00,800
Boop. What's in seven days? 420.

9
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:08,160
Oh, I get it. That's the weed number. Countdown to weed day.

10
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:12,400
It'll be nice when everyone's finally allowed to have some weed for once.

11
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:16,480
Is it bad that 420 this year falls on a Sunday?

12
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:21,920
Not only off Sunday, it's the Sunday.

13
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:25,600
It's the most Sunday-ass Sunday there is, Easter Sunday.

14
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:28,720
It's a very Sunday, Sunday.

15
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:33,520
I think you would feel bad about blazing it.

16
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:40,560
Hey, what if you saw the Easter bunny and when he came down to your chimney, he was like,

17
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:44,400
are you going to blaze one? Because it's 420. And you were like, yeah, I am.

18
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:49,440
He took off the Easter bunny hat and he was Willie Nelson the whole time.

19
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:52,240
That motherfucker loves eggs.

20
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:59,040
I haven't weeded ever. Dad, stop listening. In a long time, I haven't had weed.

21
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:04,720
But when I did, I used to make things out of Starbursts.

22
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:09,840
I used to smush them. Well, you could smush them together.

23
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:14,320
And there's a picture on Facebook a long time ago.

24
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:18,320
I may have removed it at this point of me and I made a horse out of Starbursts.

25
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:22,880
Yes, that infatuation began a long, long time ago.

26
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:25,440
And then I'm just sort of putting my mouth over it

27
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,880
as it stands triumphantly on a table and I would party on that.

28
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:34,880
So I think about this convergence of a day of the year where Starbursts are deployed

29
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:37,440
in massive numbers.

30
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:41,680
And then also you get to chief on some gangadank on the side.

31
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:46,160
If you think about it, it really is a perfect pairing of the two holidays

32
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:50,400
because it's the only time in which you're going to be fulfilled eating peeps.

33
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:54,560
Well, it's a miraculous it is actually a miraculous confluence.

34
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:58,640
Like it should always land on the same day.

35
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:01,440
Do you guys remember that one year that Ecstasy Day,

36
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:04,000
which everybody knows is the 51st Tuesday of the year

37
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:07,840
and Christmas at the same time?

38
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:10,000
And it's just like the lights.

39
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:18,160
That plant has lights in and around it.

40
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:23,920
I get super, super quiet when I when I X out.

41
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:31,200
So everybody make sure you get your candy and then get your candy for 420

42
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:34,560
because it's coming and you know that I'm going to celebrate it

43
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:40,000
like I do every Easter watching Mythbusters with my wife's grandparents.

44
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:45,360
When are they going to do an Obamacare episode?

45
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:52,160
I am in need of some witty responses to people I've just met.

46
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:55,840
The problem is that I have a highly unusual name.

47
00:03:56,400 --> 00:04:02,000
So much so that I've had to pull out ID to prove it's actually my name.

48
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,760
And when I meet new people, I usually get a comment or compliment

49
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:07,200
about how they like my name.

50
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:09,360
It's always been awkward for me.

51
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:11,600
So recently I've started responding with thanks.

52
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:13,120
I got it for my birthday.

53
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:14,480
It gets a good response.

54
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:15,280
Oh, I like that.

55
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:18,880
I know this line will get old after a while.

56
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:25,680
So please, brothers, I need some comic genius to come up with new responses.

57
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:27,680
Fancy.

58
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:30,160
Yes, it's my real name.

59
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:34,240
I mean, can you beat them to the punch?

60
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:39,520
Like when you say, like, my name's Fancy, so this is your one chance.

61
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:40,560
Don't let me down.

62
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:43,600
Yeah, I mean, that is I think probably the joke.

63
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:45,200
All three of us were planning on.

64
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:48,640
I decided to execute it faster.

65
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:49,360
I mean, yeah, yeah.

66
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:54,880
And without any sort of real punch line.

67
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:58,720
It's more isn't that song about a prostitute.

68
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:04,400
No, it could be applied to all manner professions.

69
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:08,640
I always thought it was more like a sort of a geisha host situation.

70
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:16,240
Yeah, and he was offering the girlfriend experience.

71
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:18,080
There's no sex exchange.

72
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:18,960
That's never made.

73
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:21,040
That's never writ large.

74
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:24,480
That there is a sexual favors exchange.

75
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:28,160
She says, just be nice to the gentleman fancy and they'll be nice to you.

76
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:35,520
I assume she means to offer the girlfriend experience in some sort of Japanese host bar.

77
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:38,240
It also says, don't give up the butt fancy, though.

78
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:41,360
In the second, I said not until the fifth date.

79
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:44,000
In the second bridge, it says, here's your one chance fancy.

80
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,520
Don't give up that butt.

81
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:50,400
And then that's in the live edit, not in the studio version.

82
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:55,680
In the earlier EP, in Reba's first EP, there was a lot of anal.

83
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:58,320
Don't give up the butt for less than three big.

84
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:00,080
Three big?

85
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:01,120
Three big.

86
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:01,760
That's $300.

87
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:04,080
That's not very big.

88
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:06,560
I can think of way bigger things than that.

89
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:07,200
What?

90
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:09,440
No, three large is 3000.

91
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:11,360
Three big is 300.

92
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:12,400
What's three huge?

93
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:14,640
Three million.

94
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:17,040
Three is three.

95
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:18,160
It's three dollars.

96
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:19,280
Just three dollars.

97
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:20,880
That is not a fancy price for a butt.

98
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:24,960
When you tell people your name is fancy and they doubt it, can you say something like,

99
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:26,400
oh, it's short for fanserson?

100
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:31,120
Can you correct yourself and be like, oh, I'm sorry, I meant Nancy?

101
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:33,600
And then just walk away.

102
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:34,080
Did I say fancy?

103
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:35,200
It's short for Nancy.

104
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:37,040
My name is Fnancy.

105
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:42,080
It's an F apostrophe N, like a Lovecraft name or something.

106
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:43,360
Can you clarify afterwards?

107
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:44,480
You know, like the ketchup.

108
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:46,000
Fancy style.

109
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:49,760
You don't know some fancy style ketchup.

110
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:50,640
Sure.

111
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:51,200
Fancy ketchup.

112
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:53,120
Yeah, you don't ever want plain style ketchup.

113
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:54,000
It's just red water.

114
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,040
Fancy, fancy, fancy, fancy, fancy.

115
00:06:58,320 --> 00:06:59,200
It's a fun name to say.

116
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:01,680
Oh, oh, Griffin, you just made me think of something.

117
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:05,520
Maybe just say your name so much that it loses all meaning.

118
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:06,320
Oh, my God.

119
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:07,760
And they can't know if I guess you.

120
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:14,400
Maybe you said they go, it's Fancy, Fancy, Fancy, Fancy, Fancy, Fancy, Fancy, Fancy.

121
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:19,520
You could become-

122
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:21,520
And then they walk away and you lose face.

123
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:25,520
Yeah, you could become the president of our United States of America

124
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:28,720
and then that name would be sort of the same concept,

125
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:31,200
like the name would be so normalized at that point because it's like-

126
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:32,560
Right.

127
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:33,040
You know what I mean?

128
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:34,000
Like you guys-

129
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,080
Like there had to be an uptick of like Baracks.

130
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:37,600
Yeah, or like-

131
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:38,560
Barack Obama.

132
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:41,120
At the very least, like when somebody names a kid Barack,

133
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:44,480
it's not like the Mortal Kombat fighter.

134
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:46,000
Like, no, that's Baraka, stop it.

135
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:48,800
Gear shit together.

136
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:51,760
Here's your one chance, Fancy, don't let me down.

137
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:54,080
Okay, I don't know what to tell Fancy.

138
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:55,440
That's a tough call.

139
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:57,120
I really like saying it.

140
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:58,000
I know, I do too.

141
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:06,720
Fancy, Fancy, Fancy, Fancy, Fancy, Fancy, Fancy, Fancy, Fancy, Fancy, Fancy, Fancy, Fancy, Fancy.

142
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:07,040
Okay.

143
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:10,800
Which episode of our Brother of a Brother should I start with?

144
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:12,000
Try 196.

145
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,400
They say Fancy over and over again for three minutes.

146
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:16,800
What if, okay, here's what you do.

147
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:17,840
Tell them your name is Fancy.

148
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:20,880
And when they're like, Fancy, say, well, that's my middle name.

149
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:21,680
And I go by that.

150
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:23,680
And then they say, what's your first name?

151
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:25,360
And I want you to say Exquisite.

152
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:30,880
I'm Exquisite Fancy Delight.

153
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:34,240
That's my name.

154
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:36,640
Sounds like a cat food brand, but it's not.

155
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:38,400
It's a name for me.

156
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:39,600
It's a name for me.

157
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:41,280
I got it for my birthday.

158
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:42,880
And then they'll be too busy laughing.

159
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:45,040
I'm a 20 year old Australian man.

160
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:50,560
And I recently got my first credit card, having been using debit to pay for things since I was 16.

161
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:56,880
Growing up, I have seen friends and family get into all sorts of nasty trouble and don't want this to happen to me.

162
00:08:56,880 --> 00:09:03,440
What is some advice you can give me to avoid poor spending decisions and build my credit rating without being swallowed by debt?

163
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:07,840
Much love, credit concern in Sydney and hotching, have you ever come to the right place?

164
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:13,440
For, I mean, don't make, don't paint this all out to be like fucking debtors.

165
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:17,440
We didn't all fall in that Venus flag trap.

166
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:20,800
Two of the three of us are really bad at credit.

167
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:28,240
Here, let me break this down for apparently the question asker and my two older brothers.

168
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:37,120
If you have five dollars, you can spend five dollars on your credit card at the very maximum.

169
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:41,280
Probably don't because you'll probably need some of that money for other things.

170
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:45,840
But if you just have the five, then don't spend six.

171
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:50,720
Here, here's, I was taught this by my wife where she is much smarter than me.

172
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:52,480
And here's what you do.

173
00:09:53,200 --> 00:10:00,080
You put an auto debit on your credit card for like a phone bill or your gas bill or your electric bill,

174
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:04,960
and then an auto debit at the end of the month on your credit card to pay it off with your debit card.

175
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:08,320
So a bill that you were already going to pay with your debit card,

176
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:11,440
you pay with your credit card and then you just pay that off at the end of every month.

177
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:16,400
If you have an open account, don't close it.

178
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:20,240
If you have a card that you're not going to use anymore, don't close the account.

179
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:25,040
Just leave it open because again, that's more available credit, which is good for you.

180
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:27,760
Travis's suggestion, well really, let's be honest,

181
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:29,760
Teresa's suggestion is a good one.

182
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:35,280
I use that for some subscription things just to keep the credit rolling.

183
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:39,440
Here's a helpful suggestion from Travis from my life experience.

184
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:41,040
Buy, invest in hams.

185
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:43,280
Don't invest in hams, Travis.

186
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:46,560
When you, when you charge things to your credit card,

187
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:55,040
remember that you owe the credit card people money and don't forget to pay it for months on end.

188
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:56,720
That's great.

189
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:57,120
Yeah.

190
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:58,400
That's great advice.

191
00:10:58,400 --> 00:11:01,280
Remember to pay your credit card bill.

192
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:01,760
Don't forget.

193
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:04,400
Don't fuck up because-

194
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:05,760
Don't be a fuck up.

195
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:08,560
Don't be a fuck up because I, that's what I did.

196
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:10,640
I like, I did live the first-

197
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:18,160
Can you drop 25 years of my life just not believing that it would catch up?

198
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:21,200
No, I completely agree.

199
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:25,840
I was trying, I was taking that like Tim McGraw song literally.

200
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:26,640
Like I was spending-

201
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:27,840
It wasn't even out yet.

202
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:29,360
It wasn't out yet.

203
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:32,800
I was still like, I was investing in the production of that record.

204
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:34,000
Like that's how bad it was.

205
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,080
Like, yeah, I'll pay for you to make a CD, Tim.

206
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:36,640
What's it called?

207
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:37,600
Live Like You're Dying?

208
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:38,640
I approve.

209
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:44,480
I was, I mean, I got in really bad trouble like with credit card and I ran up a huge bill

210
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:45,520
and then I couldn't pay it.

211
00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:48,000
And it seemed like this is how to get shit.

212
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:52,160
Cause they've, they extended, basically I signed up for a credit card.

213
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:53,920
This is how fucked our country is and me.

214
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:56,320
I'm not going to take the blame for this.

215
00:11:56,320 --> 00:12:00,160
I signed up for a credit card at a Reds game to get a free hat.

216
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:02,800
And my parents were like, I guess.

217
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:03,760
And I was 16.

218
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:04,080
Okay.

219
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:06,720
Sounds like a lot of people fucked up in this situation.

220
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:06,960
Yes.

221
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:07,360
Everybody's-

222
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:09,280
A hat to ruin the rest of your life?

223
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:10,080
Yeah, sure.

224
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:11,200
Cool hat though.

225
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:12,000
Great hat.

226
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,120
Is this snapback?

227
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:18,400
By the time I was in college and working 15 hours a week at Best Buy.

228
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:19,120
No big deal.

229
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:19,360
Sorry.

230
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:20,960
15 hours a week at Babbage's.

231
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:22,080
Why do you need a credit card?

232
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:24,160
You have all the money in the world.

233
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:24,880
Well, good news.

234
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:27,760
My credit limit was extended to $5,000.

235
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:37,760
I literally believed that there were two guys working at Chase.

236
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:39,280
Like, I look at this dumb shit.

237
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:41,360
I bet if I jack it up, he'll, yep, he did.

238
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:42,000
He did it.

239
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:42,560
He did it.

240
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:43,680
He filled it up again.

241
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:44,800
He spent more.

242
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:45,680
Oh, he went over.

243
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:48,320
He just bought a $30 bag of Doritos.

244
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:49,600
What a dipshit.

245
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:50,800
I hate this guy.

246
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:51,840
No, I had a huge-

247
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:56,480
I mean, it got to the point where the interest was building faster and I could pay it off.

248
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:58,640
And I eventually had to get, like, alone.

249
00:12:58,640 --> 00:12:59,760
Did they have bankruptcy?

250
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:02,000
Oh, no, not bankruptcy.

251
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:06,080
I had to get a loan to pay my shit so I could finally pay the shit off.

252
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:10,000
I had to do that, like, that, like, meet them in the middle thing where they're like, well,

253
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,600
we're never getting our money out of this guy.

254
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:16,880
So just, like, be smart about it and believe me, like, if you're listening to this and

255
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:20,720
you're in, like, a scenario where you think it's never going to catch up with you because,

256
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:22,160
like, that's for adults.

257
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:23,760
It's an adult issue.

258
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:26,320
Like, you will eventually be an adult, I promise you.

259
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:27,120
That's how it works.

260
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:31,600
And now that I have monitoring on my credit score, I really get into it because, like,

261
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:35,440
my credit score is decent now because, like, I'm watching it all the time and, like, seeing,

262
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:36,880
oh, cool, I'm up a little bit.

263
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:38,160
Here's the other important thing.

264
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:43,440
Hey, young listeners who are just starting off on the road to good credit, it takes,

265
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:50,000
like, one fuck up, one, like, miss payment, you know, one collection thing, and then,

266
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,080
like, seven years to build that back up.

267
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:56,160
I lapsed on my student loans, which I didn't even need because I had the

268
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:56,880
promise scholarship.

269
00:13:56,880 --> 00:14:02,640
Everything was paid for except for my video games and shit.

270
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:04,480
And I was like, $7,000 for free?

271
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:05,760
Fuck yeah.

272
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:06,960
Fuck no.

273
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:08,400
That was a bad move.

274
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:12,000
That did not go well for this guy.

275
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:15,440
Does anybody, do any of the three of us have better credit scores than our wives?

276
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:16,480
No.

277
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:20,720
Rachel beat the shit out of me, which sucks because when you go in for a home loan, they

278
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:21,920
go with the lowest persons.

279
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:27,440
And so Rachel was like, did her credit test and was like, oh, $1,450.

280
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:28,640
I didn't even know it could go that high.

281
00:14:28,640 --> 00:14:31,120
That's better than I did on the SATs.

282
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:35,920
I just got a red, frowny face sticker that says no, no, no.

283
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:42,480
I literally, when I called, so after I paid off my car and I needed, I think the car is

284
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:47,280
broken, I needed to buy a new car, I called the credit union that I got in my first car

285
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:50,800
loan with and said, like, hey, I'm interested in buying a car and I wanted to see if I could.

286
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:58,720
And my representative just laughed and went, no, no, no.

287
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:00,720
Here's how stupid this stuff ends.

288
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:04,800
I'm sorry about this completely unfunny 10 minutes you've all listened to, but maybe

289
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:05,840
someone will get something out of it.

290
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:15,680
When we went to buy a house, I had like this horrendous, horrendous credit history, right?

291
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:16,640
And I was working.

292
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:19,040
I didn't even have like a full time job.

293
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:23,840
I was basically a contractor with AOL.

294
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:26,800
I didn't have like a salaried position, right?

295
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:32,960
And I had $6,000 that I spent on nothing, I mean, nothing in college.

296
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:39,360
$6,000 of debt, had student loans, had all this shit and a terrible credit history.

297
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:47,360
But I was still better than Sidney because Sidney had over $100,000 in med school loans.

298
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:53,200
And it's like, if you as a bank could just make the next logical leap, you would see

299
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:56,480
that she is probably a much more sound investment than myself.

300
00:15:56,480 --> 00:16:02,800
Or maybe they assumed like this jerk spent $6,000 on Pringles and beef jerky, so she

301
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:09,360
must have spent $100,000 on Pringles and beef jerky and not all the goddamn doctor knowledge

302
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:11,200
that she put inside her fucking skull.

303
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:14,960
Just don't, please.

304
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:16,480
Don't spend any money.

305
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:18,880
Don't spend any money for any reason.

306
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:24,960
Just make wise decisions and always be working towards the goal of having good credit.

307
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,040
And you will do just fine.

308
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:27,840
Just get on Mint.

309
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:28,800
What are we talking about?

310
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:29,520
Just get on Mint.

311
00:16:29,520 --> 00:16:30,960
They'll take care of all this shit for you.

312
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:31,920
It's the best website.

313
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:37,280
Man, how long until we get our show on Saturday mornings on NPR telling people about finance

314
00:16:37,280 --> 00:16:37,760
and shit?

315
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:39,120
We're gurus.

316
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:42,240
We're credit gurus.

317
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:43,040
Credit gurus.

318
00:16:43,760 --> 00:16:44,880
How about Yahoo?

319
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:45,440
Yeah.

320
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:47,200
This Yahoo was sent in by Mike Burrows.

321
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:47,600
Thanks, Mike.

322
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:54,400
It's by Yahoo Answers user, Happy, who asks, why are most people's parents so dorky?

323
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:58,720
So throughout the years, I meet people's parents.

324
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:02,960
I must say that 99% of them are very dorky.

325
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:04,960
Where did these people grow up?

326
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:06,720
What did they grow up around?

327
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:09,600
They just look so out of place in my situations and events.

328
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:14,400
For example, when I get invited to weddings, I see a beautiful girl getting married.

329
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:17,440
And then see her parents, and I go, what in the world?

330
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:18,880
She came from those two?

331
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:21,680
It just doesn't match up.

332
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:24,720
Even with friends, I have met their parents.

333
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:26,560
They are very, very dorky.

334
00:17:26,560 --> 00:17:30,880
You look at them, and then you say, how in the world did this guy end up with such dorky

335
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:31,920
parents?

336
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:32,560
Thoughts?

337
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:37,200
He's got a point.

338
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:40,880
Like, most fucking parents are big nerds, though.

339
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:42,320
This is Dork Patrol, you know what I mean?

340
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:43,120
This is absolutely true.

341
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:43,920
Absolutely true.

342
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:44,800
But you know what, guys?

343
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:49,120
I am four months away-ish, less.

344
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:54,000
God, like, yeah, about four months away from the birth of my daughter, okay?

345
00:17:54,640 --> 00:18:01,600
And I have to tell you, the reason that parents are, look the way, are dorky is because if

346
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:07,600
they're anything like me, I have gotten to a point where I'm just, I'm just out.

347
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:17,040
I'm just out of the, what you see as a dorky and out of touch parent is a person who is

348
00:18:17,040 --> 00:18:18,560
just out of the game.

349
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:21,040
Which game are we, which game?

350
00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:22,240
The game.

351
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:24,320
It's a running joke, right?

352
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:27,680
That when you, when you get married or you get into like a serious committed relationship,

353
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:29,200
you let yourself go a little bit, right?

354
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:31,120
Because it's like, oh, I found the person.

355
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:36,400
I have to imagine it's like that with kids, but 20 times that of like, oh, I'm never

356
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:37,440
gonna be cool again.

357
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:38,160
Bye, everybody.

358
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:41,840
I don't think it's talking about, I don't think it has anything to do with weight, though.

359
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:43,680
I think it's just like, you don't-

360
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:46,160
No, I'm not saying parents are fat, I'm saying-

361
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:48,640
How come all parents are super fat?

362
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:55,120
I just, I'm saying that you reach a point where just like you are sort of preternaturally

363
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:59,040
drawn to lighter shades of jeans.

364
00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:02,640
You are just going to wear lighter and lighter and lighter jeans.

365
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:03,680
You know what I mean?

366
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:06,160
Like a pale robin's egg blue.

367
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:11,280
I feel bad for the people that are in the game constantly having to be in the game.

368
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:17,200
For me, I married a beautiful, intelligent doctor, right?

369
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:21,920
I am Garth Brooks and I have had my platinum records.

370
00:19:21,920 --> 00:19:26,800
I am now in my Chris Gaines phase where I just kind of do what the fuck ever, because

371
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:27,840
who cares?

372
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:29,520
Who cares?

373
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:30,880
I'm already out the game.

374
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:32,960
I finished the game.

375
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:35,120
Chris Gaines looked super good, though.

376
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:36,000
He looked so cool.

377
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,760
He also was non-existent.

378
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:41,920
He looked super great with a little bit of scruff in his emo hair.

379
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:45,200
I'm just saying, what I'm saying is that I'm out.

380
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:45,680
I'm done.

381
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:50,400
I might dip back in to see how the game's going, but like there had to be, for me, there

382
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:59,200
was a moment of, and it's been constantly reinforced, because I would be, when I was

383
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:04,000
a younger person, I would think, how are you older people not into this thing?

384
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,760
You're missing out on so much.

385
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:17,600
Now I have a 13-year-old sister-in-law who will get into stuff like Snapchat or Instagram.

386
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:21,200
Whoa, Riley's on Snapchat?

387
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:24,400
I don't think she's actually on Snapchat, but anyway, that service guy bad rap.

388
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:29,840
Anyway, she's on Instagram or whatever, and I think for me the moment was Pinterest.

389
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:35,280
I decided that I don't know what that is, and I'm not gonna know what it is.

390
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:36,960
And I'm not willing to find out.

391
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:41,280
And I'm not willing to find out, so the game can keep going, and I'm just gonna be back

392
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:41,840
here.

393
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:43,520
I finished my rounds.

394
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:44,800
Now it's somebody else's turn.

395
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:46,640
I'm not gonna get dipped back in.

396
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:50,800
You have to realize, though, that that idea of like, what are you into now?

397
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:51,360
Okay.

398
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:55,600
And dipping back in to check and see how stuff's going, that's what this question asker is

399
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:56,560
talking about.

400
00:20:56,560 --> 00:20:57,600
That's the nerd shit.

401
00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:00,400
That's the, ah, Pinterest, let me just pin my kids.

402
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:02,160
Hey, kids, got some pins for you.

403
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:03,360
Push, push, push, push, push.

404
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:05,200
That's what you do.

405
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:07,040
You push pins into your children.

406
00:21:07,040 --> 00:21:08,320
That's at Pinterest?

407
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:09,360
To punish them.

408
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:09,760
To punish.

409
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:10,640
For Snapchatting.

410
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:11,360
For Snapchat.

411
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:12,640
I caught you Snapchatting.

412
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:13,520
Come over here.

413
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:14,800
Got some thumbtacks.

414
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:17,680
Not the tacks again.

415
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:19,680
Gonna put them on the bottom of your shoes.

416
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:21,040
Turn you into a little Ben Vereen.

417
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:27,760
That's how I'll punish my children, is I'll turn them into unsuspecting tap dancers.

418
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:38,800
Just trust me on this, that like, grown ups, parents are not as bothered by how out of

419
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:41,520
the game they are as you.

420
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:45,840
Like, you would not go out of the house in pants up to your belly button.

421
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:46,640
They don't care.

422
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:48,080
They're out.

423
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:49,760
But that's not every parent.

424
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:52,320
Here's what I can't wrap my mind around.

425
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:56,560
I feel like right now, in this moment in time, for at least the next four goddamn months

426
00:21:56,560 --> 00:22:02,240
before Justin ruins this whole dynamic that we have going, I feel like the three of us

427
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:07,200
are not nerds and we're not super, like, trying to be super cool.

428
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:09,840
We are at this very comfortable medium.

429
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:14,640
We are at this very, like, nice mid zone between those two extremes.

430
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:19,440
Our density is such that we're floating on the oil but below the water.

431
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:20,400
But below the water.

432
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:24,000
That cool ass water and that nerdy stupid oil.

433
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,600
We're somewhere in the middle there.

434
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:29,520
I don't think once you become a parent, you can maintain that equilibrium.

435
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:36,880
You go either like, hey, Kent, or like, Harry Styles, like, fucking one way or the other.

436
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:41,120
And I'm terrified of that.

437
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:43,600
Yeah, I've always been so cool.

438
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:44,640
I'm worried.

439
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:47,120
I'm not saying you're cool.

440
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:47,920
I'm not saying you're cool.

441
00:22:47,920 --> 00:22:49,600
You're kind of a fucking dweebo.

442
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:51,280
But you're not a huge dweebo.

443
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:51,840
You know what I mean?

444
00:22:52,560 --> 00:22:58,160
We're the goddamn day walkers of coolness.

445
00:22:58,160 --> 00:23:00,480
And like, I don't think parents can maintain that shit.

446
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:05,120
They either try super, super hard and I've met some cool ass parents.

447
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:09,440
Or they become fucking Rick Moranis in My Other Dad.

448
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:10,240
What's that movie called?

449
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:11,760
My Other Dad.

450
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:13,600
Got it in one.

451
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:19,200
I love, you know, every so often whenever we do these questions, it's always weird to

452
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:23,440
me, like, the one detail that really sticks in my mind from the question.

453
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:27,760
And in this one, it's 99% of parents he meets.

454
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:31,840
Because that means this dude's met at least 100 parents.

455
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:35,360
And 99 of them were dorks.

456
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:35,920
Yeah.

457
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:40,160
Otherwise, he's like cutting people in half or he's judging people like a quarter of them

458
00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:42,480
was pretty dorky, but the rest of it was okay.

459
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:44,640
Dan said some cool shit once.

460
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:48,320
I'm going to bump that down to 99%, not 100%.

461
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:50,560
Most of the time, though.

462
00:23:50,560 --> 00:23:56,400
I just, I feel like that once I have a kid, I'm going to try to be as uncool as possible.

463
00:23:56,960 --> 00:23:58,480
But not in an aggressive way.

464
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:02,480
I want to be cool in like a constant, steadfast, reliable way.

465
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:05,840
You can always trust Justin to say something dorky.

466
00:24:06,560 --> 00:24:10,320
No, not to say something like, I am just going to crystallize.

467
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:16,560
And maybe, like, we have people who have done that in the world, like celebrities, for example,

468
00:24:16,560 --> 00:24:21,600
who have crystallized exactly where they are, and then the world comes back around.

469
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:22,880
They find them again.

470
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:25,600
Look, I have a great example for you, Sam Elliott.

471
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:33,040
Sam Elliott got to 1973, and he's like, well, this is who I am.

472
00:24:33,040 --> 00:24:34,000
This is where I get off.

473
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:37,440
I'm going to trap my whole spirit in a magical painting.

474
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:39,200
Okay, Sam Elliott.

475
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:41,360
I'm just going to live here.

476
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:44,000
I'm going to keep the stash exactly like it is.

477
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,720
It's 1973, and I'm going to stay right here.

478
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:51,520
I'm going to get a Mantis alien monster to freeze me in his crystals.

479
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:54,320
Maybe I'll meet y'all down that trail.

480
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:57,600
Maybe I won't, but I will be exactly here.

481
00:24:57,600 --> 00:24:59,520
See you guys in Ghost Rider.

482
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:02,000
I will check you all in Ghost Rider.

483
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:06,320
He is the proverbial ribbon that we tied around a tree in the forest, like, where are we?

484
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:07,600
Oh, there's Sam Elliott.

485
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:09,360
Sam Elliott is our constant.

486
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:10,640
He is our constant.

487
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:14,960
I'm saying that Sam Elliott got off.

488
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:17,200
He was like, well, this is working for me pretty good.

489
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:18,800
I'm just going to hop off here.

490
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:20,480
And then we come back around.

491
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:22,240
Big Lebowski comes back around.

492
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:24,560
Uh, Parson Wreck comes back around.

493
00:25:24,560 --> 00:25:26,960
We all come back around and say, hey, is Sam Elliott still?

494
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:27,600
Yes, he is.

495
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:28,000
Yes, he is.

496
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:29,840
He's still exactly right there.

497
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:30,720
He's cool again.

498
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:32,880
That's going to be me, I think.

499
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:35,200
Eventually, maybe in 2040.

500
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:39,200
You feel comfortable just go ahead and throwing out that you're going to be the Sam Elliott of the future?

501
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:43,280
You're comfortable saying that you, right now, you are cool with forever.

502
00:25:43,280 --> 00:25:47,120
No improvements, no tweaks, no changes, no chopping, no screwing.

503
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:51,600
What I'm saying is that if society gets to a point in 2040 where they're like,

504
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:52,880
you know what we need?

505
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:55,680
We need to find a chubby guy in a Night Trap t-shirt.

506
00:25:57,680 --> 00:25:58,480
That'd be cool.

507
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:02,720
I'd be like, well, if only someone had locked that down 30 years.

508
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:03,680
Lock that down.

509
00:26:03,680 --> 00:26:08,720
And then they'll be going through like microfiche and they'll find like an old newspaper clipping

510
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:10,320
of me like this guy.

511
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:11,760
There's no way he's still.

512
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:12,320
He is.

513
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:18,160
He's been waiting here with his friend, Sam Elliott and his daughter who loves him just the way he is.

514
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:23,200
Oh, hey, Justin, why don't you throw Wirehead Ned into the Sega CD?

515
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:25,440
No problem, Sam.

516
00:26:27,280 --> 00:26:29,040
Hey, Sam, you want to listen to some new music?

517
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:30,960
Absolutely not.

518
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:32,320
Don't go against our bargain.

519
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:35,120
Listen, you know the rules of staying in my lodge.

520
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:39,440
Basically, it's basically full house.

521
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:40,960
If you evolve, you have to leave.

522
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:43,360
Stagnation is the word.

523
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:47,440
What's the wash word here at Sam Elliott's stagnation lodge?

524
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:51,840
I only want to listen to live slide guitar and watch you play full motion video games.

525
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:55,920
Justin, we got any more of that good sarsaparilla?

526
00:26:58,480 --> 00:26:59,280
Check the cooler.

527
00:26:59,920 --> 00:27:02,160
Have you figured out which kind of TV dad you're going to be?

528
00:27:02,160 --> 00:27:04,960
Like on the TV dad spectrum where you're going to land?

529
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:08,240
I hope you go Carl Winslow.

530
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:10,000
I was thinking Carl Winslow.

531
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:11,920
I'm going to go Breaking Bad, I think.

532
00:27:11,920 --> 00:27:13,280
Oh, Justin.

533
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:13,920
I'm sorry.

534
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:15,760
Got to get that paper.

535
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:24,800
I'm a guy in my 30s who got into cycling a few years ago as a way to stay fit and keep busy.

536
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:28,320
I've really grown to love it and I try to do it as much as possible.

537
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:31,440
Problem is I want to incorporate this activity into things I love doing,

538
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:34,640
like getting coffee or visiting the local microbrewery.

539
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:39,760
In order to do this, I would have to go to these public places all sweaty and clad in my Lycra

540
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:40,240
shorts.

541
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:41,040
Am I good?

542
00:27:41,040 --> 00:27:46,320
Am I allowed to both stay fit and drink beer among non-cyclists or do I have to leave the

543
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:50,640
luxurious Lycra and clicky clacky shoes at home?

544
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:54,640
Uh-oh, his parents have been dishing out some thumbtack punishment.

545
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:57,600
That's from a sweaty cyclist in St. Catherine's, Canada.

546
00:27:59,920 --> 00:28:02,720
My inclination of this is to say fuck it.

547
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:04,160
Okay.

548
00:28:05,040 --> 00:28:07,280
Well, because like if you get-

549
00:28:07,280 --> 00:28:09,520
Okay, so it would go like this.

550
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:15,440
It would go like this, you ride your bike down to the coffee shop, you roll in, somebody

551
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:18,560
sit in the corner, judges you for being a cyclist.

552
00:28:19,280 --> 00:28:24,240
They're judging you for like being fit and enjoying an outdoor activity that's healthy

553
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:24,800
for you.

554
00:28:24,800 --> 00:28:26,000
I think it depends.

555
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:31,600
It depends like if you did this in Austin, I think people probably wear Lycra shorts

556
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:35,760
here sort of recreationally, so I wouldn't sweat it as much.

557
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:38,480
I mean, you will sweat it.

558
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:44,080
And I don't understand how you're cool with that.

559
00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:47,680
Like I'm good for you, good on you, getting fit, riding.

560
00:28:47,680 --> 00:28:54,480
I can't understand how you can be so cool with your shorts comfort game being so, so,

561
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:55,040
so off.

562
00:28:57,520 --> 00:29:03,200
I don't own non-cargo shits because like I need a-

563
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:04,720
You need to breathe.

564
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:06,800
It's not even breath.

565
00:29:06,800 --> 00:29:12,320
It's like I just need my whole zone to exist in like a safe spot.

566
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:12,880
You know what I mean?

567
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:15,280
Here's the thing, ditto, but here's the thing.

568
00:29:15,280 --> 00:29:17,120
Shorts are comfortable and easy to wear.

569
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:18,960
And if they're not fitting that description, they ain't shorts.

570
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:19,680
They ain't shorts.

571
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:23,200
They're dick prisons or vagina prisons.

572
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:28,560
There's physical comfort, but there's also like emotional mental comfort.

573
00:29:28,560 --> 00:29:29,680
You know what I mean?

574
00:29:29,680 --> 00:29:35,760
Lycra is emotionally, physically, spiritually, economically unsound

575
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:39,120
on materials to wrap around your zone.

576
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:46,320
I see someone, when someone arrives at the same place as me, when they're cycling,

577
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:48,560
I just, I can't help myself.

578
00:29:48,560 --> 00:29:54,480
I just feel really, I feel really envious, but also perplexed.

579
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:58,320
Like where, like, I don't understand any of that lifestyle.

580
00:29:58,320 --> 00:30:00,480
Like, where did you, where do you put your bike?

581
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:03,200
Where did you get a bike?

582
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:05,600
How do you get your bike over the curb?

583
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:07,760
That's the thing I could honestly never master.

584
00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:09,040
What do you do?

585
00:30:09,040 --> 00:30:10,240
How did, where do you put it?

586
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:12,480
What if somebody steals it?

587
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:13,120
You're stuck.

588
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:15,760
Well, I live here now, I guess.

589
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:17,040
I live here.

590
00:30:17,040 --> 00:30:18,080
God damn it.

591
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:19,040
I'm a ghost.

592
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:23,680
I don't know how anybody gets into the biking lifestyle, but it seems like really,

593
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:24,960
I don't know.

594
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:26,080
It seems like cool.

595
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:29,840
Like Dave Lavender, our buddy Dave Lavender from the hairless batch,

596
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:31,360
he rides his bike like everywhere.

597
00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:32,960
Every time he shows up, I feel bad.

598
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:35,040
I start, it's like self doubt.

599
00:30:35,040 --> 00:30:36,080
I'm like, I don't know.

600
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:39,280
I guess I could have ridden a bike.

601
00:30:39,280 --> 00:30:42,400
I don't have one, but if I had one, I guess I could have ridden it.

602
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:43,440
I didn't need to drive.

603
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:46,400
He rolls up like sup, I got here for free and I lost a pound.

604
00:30:47,280 --> 00:30:48,320
You did that?

605
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:49,760
You did that coming here?

606
00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:57,040
You just did that and getting, like I got here and it cost me $45 in gas and I got fatter.

607
00:30:57,040 --> 00:30:59,920
Cause of course I'm going to eat those combos I left in the glove compartment.

608
00:30:59,920 --> 00:31:00,420
Okay.

609
00:31:01,280 --> 00:31:05,040
My big fear about biking everywhere is what if I get to a hill?

610
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:08,720
Cause then I would have to, I'd have to call a cab.

611
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:11,760
You need a Google maps where it has like traffic.

612
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:15,440
It can be like, this is, this has a four degree incline.

613
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:17,360
Like, ah, fuck find alternate route.

614
00:31:17,920 --> 00:31:23,120
This will take you on a toll road and it'll take you four hours longer, but there's no hills.

615
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:24,640
But it's flat all the way.

616
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:26,240
Flat a hundred percent of the way.

617
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:28,320
Oh man.

618
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:29,360
I wish I could bike.

619
00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:31,680
I really do wish I could bike.

620
00:31:31,680 --> 00:31:33,040
Cause like, I don't know.

621
00:31:33,040 --> 00:31:34,640
It's like a two wheeled horse.

622
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:36,320
You get that freedom, that wind in your hair.

623
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:37,520
And like, I love that shit.

624
00:31:37,520 --> 00:31:41,040
But like really, how do you get it up on the curb?

625
00:31:41,040 --> 00:31:43,600
You could do that sweet move where you kind of skid to a stop and

626
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:46,560
slide sideways and gravel sprays out into the nerd's face.

627
00:31:46,560 --> 00:31:46,800
Right.

628
00:31:46,800 --> 00:31:50,560
I will have to do that every time I get to a curb because I don't understand how people get there.

629
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:53,440
Dad tried to teach me that shit when I was like seven years old.

630
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:55,520
He's like, yeah, you just lift up on the handles and you do like a little

631
00:31:55,520 --> 00:31:57,920
backwards butt scoot and the wheel just goes up and over it.

632
00:31:57,920 --> 00:31:59,280
I'm like, okay, let me give it a try.

633
00:31:59,280 --> 00:32:00,160
Fall dead.

634
00:32:00,160 --> 00:32:00,720
Every time.

635
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:02,560
So dead.

636
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:02,960
So dead.

637
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:06,160
And like, I could do that when I'm seven years old with my goddamn rubbery bones.

638
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:09,680
I'm all brittle now because I can't drink fucking cow's milk.

639
00:32:11,680 --> 00:32:12,800
That is another thing.

640
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:13,840
I'm at a point.

641
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:19,120
I don't know how I got to this point in my life, but like I'm at a point now where a fall could be tragic.

642
00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:22,240
It could be game changer.

643
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:25,840
Not just tragic, like for you physically health wise, but also tragic.

644
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:29,040
Like if you see a seven year old crash on a bike, first of all, it's awesome.

645
00:32:29,680 --> 00:32:30,800
Yeah, hysterical.

646
00:32:30,800 --> 00:32:34,960
Second of all, second of all, you look at me like, look at that scrappy kid.

647
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:37,200
He's probably right into a softball game.

648
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:40,880
If I fall on a bike, I will be laughed at for a year.

649
00:32:41,520 --> 00:32:43,120
What were you doing on a bike?

650
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:43,680
I'll end up on a fucking-

651
00:32:43,680 --> 00:32:47,920
Or worse yet, everyone will rush to your side in a very concerned manner.

652
00:32:47,920 --> 00:32:56,400
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, sir, are you okay?

653
00:32:56,400 --> 00:32:56,480
I could deal with that. I would be embarrassed by that.

654
00:32:56,480 --> 00:32:56,960
If I fell here in Austin, I would end up on like the front page of a zine.

655
00:32:59,040 --> 00:33:01,920
I would be laughed out of town on a rail.

656
00:33:01,920 --> 00:33:05,200
Be that they would put me on because they wouldn't trust me with bikes anymore.

657
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:10,480
There are so many like bike literate cities that if you fuck up a bike here,

658
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:15,760
if you fuck up a bike in a super bike literate city, your bike ability will be revoked and you

659
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:17,360
and you will have to get on a Razor scooter

660
00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:18,960
and that won't last long either.

661
00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:24,320
Huntington has a bike lane now, I don't.

662
00:33:24,320 --> 00:33:26,800
Just the one on one street?

663
00:33:26,800 --> 00:33:29,560
No, I mean downtown there's a lot of bike lanes

664
00:33:29,560 --> 00:33:32,440
and the way people have decided to use that

665
00:33:32,440 --> 00:33:36,760
is that drivers just get like super luxurious

666
00:33:36,760 --> 00:33:39,080
about opening their doors when they get out of their car.

667
00:33:39,080 --> 00:33:43,720
Oh, this is fantastic, I might be gonna look.

668
00:33:43,720 --> 00:33:45,560
I got room to breathe.

669
00:33:45,560 --> 00:33:49,240
Woosh, woosh.

670
00:33:49,240 --> 00:33:50,400
I'm gonna check.

671
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:53,440
Let's go to Mighty Fine.

672
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:55,440
Who do we got a message for?

673
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:07,960
This message is for Chris and it's from Esme,

674
00:34:07,960 --> 00:34:09,760
which is an awesome name.

675
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:12,240
And Esme says, you are my best pal

676
00:34:12,240 --> 00:34:14,680
and ultimate co-host of Four Star Dog.

677
00:34:14,680 --> 00:34:18,280
Having you in my life and my pack makes me one lucky gal.

678
00:34:18,280 --> 00:34:20,920
Here's to ultimate laughs to our old and shriveled.

679
00:34:20,920 --> 00:34:21,920
What is Four Star Dog?

680
00:34:21,920 --> 00:34:26,200
Is that a podcast that they just sneak in some advertising?

681
00:34:26,200 --> 00:34:28,140
How could you do this, Esme?

682
00:34:30,240 --> 00:34:31,420
It's not popping up.

683
00:34:31,420 --> 00:34:34,600
Maybe it's an underground, maybe it's on the deep web.

684
00:34:34,600 --> 00:34:36,880
Ooh, Esme, I'm gonna look that shit up.

685
00:34:36,880 --> 00:34:37,960
I will be very cross.

686
00:34:37,960 --> 00:34:39,580
I mean, we said it and did it.

687
00:34:39,580 --> 00:34:40,420
It's been broadcast.

688
00:34:40,420 --> 00:34:42,880
If you have a Silk Road podcast, I'm gonna be very.

689
00:34:42,880 --> 00:34:45,160
I got a message for Jeff from Steve.

690
00:34:46,520 --> 00:34:48,560
Steve says, happy birthday.

691
00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:51,060
You definitely have a birthday sometime this year.

692
00:34:51,060 --> 00:34:53,120
I hope this message reaches you in time,

693
00:34:53,120 --> 00:34:57,280
which is unexpectedly sort of intense for a birthday message.

694
00:34:57,280 --> 00:34:59,520
But anyway, thanks to you and Caroline

695
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:03,000
for being great friends and introducing me to Bim Bam.

696
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:03,960
That's the name of our show.

697
00:35:03,960 --> 00:35:05,720
How did you have fucking problems saying that?

698
00:35:05,720 --> 00:35:09,400
You've all set back my dissertation hundreds of hours.

699
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:11,080
I hope life is good in Chicago.

700
00:35:11,080 --> 00:35:13,320
Here's to more beer, more trivia,

701
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:16,040
and more tennis in 2014.

702
00:35:16,040 --> 00:35:20,000
Two of those things are awesome.

703
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:21,400
Two of those I was into.

704
00:35:21,400 --> 00:35:22,320
Sure.

705
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:24,020
So happy birthday, Jeff,

706
00:35:24,020 --> 00:35:26,240
whenever that happy day should occur.

707
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:29,480
And how about we tennis?

708
00:35:29,480 --> 00:35:31,580
How about a little bit of we tennis?

709
00:35:31,580 --> 00:35:33,000
How about we tennis?

710
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:36,720
Puff, puff, serve.

711
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:40,480
So guys, did you notice how, puff, puff, serve.

712
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:42,280
Thank you, thank you.

713
00:35:42,280 --> 00:35:44,260
Travis always has a secret joke in there

714
00:35:44,260 --> 00:35:45,100
that's like super funny.

715
00:35:45,100 --> 00:35:46,300
That really does happen every week.

716
00:35:46,300 --> 00:35:47,140
Well, we miss it completely.

717
00:35:47,140 --> 00:35:49,560
Every week someone tweets something at us like, what?

718
00:35:49,560 --> 00:35:50,440
That's hysterical.

719
00:35:50,440 --> 00:35:51,280
What was it last week?

720
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:54,120
Somebody tweeted and I was like, fuck, that's good.

721
00:35:54,120 --> 00:35:54,960
And then they were like, yeah,

722
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:58,200
Travis said that out loud to you during the show

723
00:35:58,200 --> 00:35:59,680
and you fucked it and you missed it.

724
00:35:59,680 --> 00:36:00,520
It was the piano mandate.

725
00:36:00,520 --> 00:36:02,560
Listen, when you said as much shit as I did

726
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:03,400
on a piano mandate.

727
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:04,880
We were talking about the Billy Joel station

728
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:06,320
and said it was called the piano mandate

729
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:09,640
and Justin and I were just like, well, here's our joke.

730
00:36:09,640 --> 00:36:10,480
That's hysterical.

731
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:11,320
That's hysterical.

732
00:36:11,320 --> 00:36:14,320
Okay, so there's a channel that plays all Billy Joel.

733
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:15,160
So it's okay.

734
00:36:15,160 --> 00:36:16,720
Still hasn't changed, by the way.

735
00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:19,400
Thanks serious XM really made me believe in myself.

736
00:36:19,400 --> 00:36:23,400
Did you guys notice how I was on time for the show today?

737
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:27,000
Did you notice that I was a little late,

738
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:28,560
but I wasn't as late as normal.

739
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:31,320
That's because I was grabbing a shave before

740
00:36:31,320 --> 00:36:34,040
and normally I do the wet shaving thing.

741
00:36:34,040 --> 00:36:36,760
It takes me like a hundred years to do that.

742
00:36:36,760 --> 00:36:39,880
I do the wet shaving thing, it takes me like a hundred years.

743
00:36:39,880 --> 00:36:44,880
And today I tried a kit from Harry's.com,

744
00:36:44,920 --> 00:36:48,020
which is they give you their support of the show.

745
00:36:48,020 --> 00:36:50,440
They deliver a better shaving experience

746
00:36:50,440 --> 00:36:53,400
for just a fraction of the price.

747
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:56,160
I got this great, it's a great razor,

748
00:36:56,160 --> 00:36:57,840
a lovely tube of shaving cream,

749
00:36:57,840 --> 00:37:00,640
some really funny shaving instructions and backup razor.

750
00:37:00,640 --> 00:37:03,600
Can you explain the funny shaving instructions?

751
00:37:03,600 --> 00:37:04,440
They're funny.

752
00:37:04,440 --> 00:37:05,260
I mean, it's funny.

753
00:37:05,260 --> 00:37:06,800
It's humorous, like in a funny way.

754
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:08,600
It's a funny, it's a funny shavings.

755
00:37:08,600 --> 00:37:09,520
I don't know, what do you want?

756
00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:13,360
I usually don't jam on like, just like, you know, razor,

757
00:37:13,360 --> 00:37:15,760
cause I have a very sensitive skin

758
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:18,940
and it tends to break out if I just use like a regular razor,

759
00:37:18,940 --> 00:37:20,560
but that thing was dope.

760
00:37:20,560 --> 00:37:22,600
Like the razor we got from Harry's

761
00:37:22,600 --> 00:37:24,120
gave me such a smooth shave

762
00:37:24,120 --> 00:37:26,640
and it was very gentle on my delicate skin.

763
00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:30,160
It's a convenient and get it online for 15 bucks.

764
00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:34,200
You get that kit that we got, it's in a really pretty box

765
00:37:34,200 --> 00:37:38,400
and it includes a handle, three blades and shaving cream

766
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:39,680
and shipped right to your door.

767
00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:40,520
It's like half the price.

768
00:37:40,520 --> 00:37:43,120
Three German engineered blades.

769
00:37:43,120 --> 00:37:48,120
So you know that they are made of hard metals

770
00:37:48,620 --> 00:37:50,360
cause that's what Germans love.

771
00:37:50,360 --> 00:37:52,040
That's what Germans love.

772
00:37:52,040 --> 00:37:54,820
It was started by, one of the co-founders is Jeff,

773
00:37:54,820 --> 00:37:57,140
who was the guy who started friend of the show,

774
00:37:57,140 --> 00:37:57,980
Warby Parker.

775
00:37:57,980 --> 00:37:59,160
He knows Warby Parker, I guess.

776
00:37:59,160 --> 00:38:04,160
Your whole face is going to one day be catered to.

777
00:38:04,360 --> 00:38:05,560
This is by Jeff.

778
00:38:05,560 --> 00:38:09,320
Jeff has opened up a septum piercing salon

779
00:38:09,320 --> 00:38:11,120
that you can just go to and get that.

780
00:38:11,120 --> 00:38:12,880
Jeff's an eyeball replacement.

781
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:14,280
Jeff's my face guy.

782
00:38:14,280 --> 00:38:17,020
Jeff's my, Jeff does my face.

783
00:38:17,020 --> 00:38:20,420
I got Susan, who does my shoulders.

784
00:38:21,320 --> 00:38:22,240
And I want to be clear here.

785
00:38:22,240 --> 00:38:24,160
This is a shave kit for everyone.

786
00:38:24,160 --> 00:38:25,740
My wife enjoys that as well.

787
00:38:25,740 --> 00:38:27,680
So everybody go check it out.

788
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:30,600
It really is a pretty sweet set and you're going to love it.

789
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:34,040

00:38:42,060 --> 00:38:43,280
My brother is that code.

795
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:44,700
It's all one word.

796
00:38:44,700 --> 00:38:47,000
And the web address is harrys.com.

797
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:48,840
So go get your shave on.

798
00:38:48,840 --> 00:38:53,280
I love how many of these righteous organizations

799
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:54,700
have been supporting us lately.

800
00:38:54,700 --> 00:38:56,360
I do miss the freedom

801
00:38:56,360 --> 00:38:58,200
that extreme restraints afforded us

802
00:38:58,200 --> 00:39:00,200
in being able to choose our own

803
00:39:00,200 --> 00:39:02,260
extremely hackable promo code.

804
00:39:04,260 --> 00:39:06,520
I forget where we left, where we left that.

805
00:39:06,520 --> 00:39:08,440
I forget what the last one.

806
00:39:08,440 --> 00:39:09,800
It was Sexabunga.

807
00:39:09,800 --> 00:39:12,080
Ah, Sexabunga, so good.

808
00:39:12,080 --> 00:39:14,560
So, so much viral promise.

809
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:19,560
Moving on to once you're smooth shaven,

810
00:39:19,880 --> 00:39:21,320
you want to tell people about it.

811
00:39:21,320 --> 00:39:22,140
How?

812
00:39:22,140 --> 00:39:22,980
Twitter?

813
00:39:22,980 --> 00:39:23,800
No.

814
00:39:23,800 --> 00:39:24,640
Too short.

815
00:39:24,640 --> 00:39:25,480
Facebook?

816
00:39:25,480 --> 00:39:26,520
Tumblr?

817
00:39:26,520 --> 00:39:27,960
No one knows what that is.

818
00:39:27,960 --> 00:39:30,400
Maybe a website brought to you.

819
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:32,080
MySmoothFace.com.

820
00:39:32,080 --> 00:39:35,160
MySmoothFace.com, a Squarespace joint.

821
00:39:35,160 --> 00:39:38,080
Can I use secret to tell everybody about my smooth face

822
00:39:38,080 --> 00:39:40,120
and then they won't know who has it,

823
00:39:40,120 --> 00:39:41,640
but they will know that one of their friends

824
00:39:41,640 --> 00:39:44,600
is enjoying a very smooth face.

825
00:39:44,600 --> 00:39:45,640
And they'll start going around

826
00:39:45,640 --> 00:39:47,120
touching the faces of all their friends.

827
00:39:47,120 --> 00:39:49,380
Like, nope, it wasn't Roger.

828
00:39:49,380 --> 00:39:51,520
Griffin, while I register that domain,

829
00:39:51,520 --> 00:39:54,620
can you please tell everybody about Squarespace?

830
00:39:54,620 --> 00:39:58,600
Squarespace is a platform that allows you

831
00:39:58,600 --> 00:40:03,400
to make a website, which sounds intimidating.

832
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:04,240
Doesn't have to be,

833
00:40:04,240 --> 00:40:06,820
because they have really beautiful designs

834
00:40:06,820 --> 00:40:08,760
that you can sort of kick things off with.

835
00:40:08,760 --> 00:40:10,980
And then you have all the style options

836
00:40:10,980 --> 00:40:13,400
that you could ever need or want,

837
00:40:13,400 --> 00:40:15,540
and then you can chop and screw it.

838
00:40:15,540 --> 00:40:17,080
And if you have a problem with that,

839
00:40:17,080 --> 00:40:20,020
because maybe you're not so good at the deep web,

840
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:22,600
you can contact their support team,

841
00:40:22,600 --> 00:40:24,860
which they have available 24 seven.

842
00:40:26,040 --> 00:40:29,660
And you can make a logo using their logo generator

843
00:40:29,660 --> 00:40:31,900
for your website, a little FAF icon maybe.

844
00:40:33,320 --> 00:40:34,760
And it's just $8 a month,

845
00:40:34,760 --> 00:40:36,300
and that includes a free domain name

846
00:40:36,300 --> 00:40:38,000
if you sign up for a year.

847
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:41,000
So Squarespace, it's really good.

848
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:42,800
They've been a good supporter of the show,

849
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:44,200
and we've heard from a few people

850
00:40:44,200 --> 00:40:46,600
who made some good looking websites.

851
00:40:46,600 --> 00:40:48,440
It's got responsive design,

852
00:40:48,440 --> 00:40:50,120

855
00:40:55,500 --> 00:40:57,280

And yeah, that's great.

861
00:41:10,080 --> 00:41:12,240
Maybe you wanna do like firstpurse.com.

862
00:41:12,240 --> 00:41:13,080
Listen guys.

863
00:41:13,080 --> 00:41:13,900
Sell some first purses.

864
00:41:13,900 --> 00:41:15,200
Please, I just got my smooth face.

865
00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:17,240
I can't even get first purse too.

866
00:41:17,240 --> 00:41:20,200
Listen, the web sucks, but Squarespace

867
00:41:20,200 --> 00:41:24,140
is gonna let you fix it one website at a time.

868
00:41:24,140 --> 00:41:26,480
That's not the tagline that they gave us,

869
00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:28,200
but it's the one that I'm giving them.

870
00:41:28,200 --> 00:41:29,920
It's the one we deserve.

871
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:32,140
It's, the web is not great lately.

872
00:41:32,140 --> 00:41:34,840
I don't know if you guys have been keeping up with it.

873
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:36,880
All of my sites are,

874
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:40,400
their posting schedules have become so erratic, and.

875
00:41:42,280 --> 00:41:43,960
Homestar Runner doesn't update enough.

876
00:41:43,960 --> 00:41:46,600
They did update it earlier this month.

877
00:41:46,600 --> 00:41:50,160
They deployed the first update in like nine years.

878
00:41:50,160 --> 00:41:52,000
God, I miss Homestar Runner so much.

879
00:41:53,240 --> 00:41:54,160
Hold on just one second.

880
00:41:54,160 --> 00:41:55,680
I'm setting up the forward here.

881
00:41:55,680 --> 00:41:56,520
Okay.

882
00:41:56,520 --> 00:41:57,940
Are you really setting, buying?

883
00:41:59,360 --> 00:42:00,400
Just had to grab it real quick

884
00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:02,560
so nobody tries to steal it.

885
00:42:02,560 --> 00:42:03,680
What's the web address?

886
00:42:03,680 --> 00:42:05,000
What's the URL?

887
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:06,380
MySmoothFace.com.

888
00:42:08,280 --> 00:42:09,120
Try it.

889
00:42:09,120 --> 00:42:14,120
Okay.

890
00:42:14,360 --> 00:42:16,680
And it redirects to my brother, my brother, and me.

891
00:42:16,680 --> 00:42:17,600
What's up?

892
00:42:19,720 --> 00:42:20,840
Try Fart Patrol.

893
00:42:25,400 --> 00:42:28,840
That one redirects to my brother, my brother, and me.

894
00:42:28,840 --> 00:42:30,040
It's a pretty good game.

895
00:42:30,040 --> 00:42:33,180
We'll try Butt Slammers.

896
00:42:35,160 --> 00:42:36,140
All right, go Justin.

897
00:42:36,140 --> 00:42:37,500
Okay.

898
00:42:37,500 --> 00:42:39,660
Butt Slammers is a different thing.

899
00:42:41,980 --> 00:42:43,560
Just super quick.

900
00:42:43,560 --> 00:42:46,740
Want to remind you guys that the second annual

901
00:42:46,740 --> 00:42:49,360
Atlantic Ocean Comedy and Music Festival

902
00:42:49,360 --> 00:42:50,640
is brought to you by MaxFun.

903
00:42:50,640 --> 00:42:51,480
It's coming around.

904
00:42:51,480 --> 00:42:54,160
It was a lot of fun the first time.

905
00:42:54,160 --> 00:42:56,080
You guessed, you're assuming,

906
00:42:56,080 --> 00:42:58,480
because you didn't get to go on a particular

907
00:42:58,480 --> 00:43:00,040
nautical adventure.

908
00:43:00,040 --> 00:43:03,480
Yeah, but their ship's gonna set sail

909
00:43:03,480 --> 00:43:06,780
from Port Canaveral for three nights in the Bahamas

910
00:43:06,780 --> 00:43:08,920
July 25th through the 28th.

911
00:43:10,240 --> 00:43:13,520
And it's gonna have Moshe Kasher, Chris Fairbanks,

912
00:43:13,520 --> 00:43:16,360
who's like hysterical if you haven't met the guy.

913
00:43:17,360 --> 00:43:18,880
Kyle Kinane is gonna be there.

914
00:43:18,880 --> 00:43:20,760
He's hysterical.

915
00:43:20,760 --> 00:43:21,600
Chris Fairbanks.

916
00:43:21,600 --> 00:43:23,240
He's the one that almost murdered us with laughter.

917
00:43:23,240 --> 00:43:24,880
With laughter.

918
00:43:24,880 --> 00:43:26,600
Natasha Legaro, Morgan Murphy,

919
00:43:26,600 --> 00:43:27,600
who is also hysterical.

920
00:43:27,600 --> 00:43:28,440
Also fucking great.

921
00:43:28,440 --> 00:43:29,800
John Roderick of the Long Winters,

922
00:43:29,800 --> 00:43:31,720
like from the use of our theme song,

923
00:43:31,720 --> 00:43:32,560
It's a Departure Off the Elm,

924
00:43:32,560 --> 00:43:34,320
but there's been that John Roderick.

925
00:43:34,320 --> 00:43:36,000
He's gonna be like there on a boat

926
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:37,840
where you just talk to him in BD.

927
00:43:37,840 --> 00:43:39,860
Goddamn, that makes me so angry.

928
00:43:39,860 --> 00:43:42,680
I know, pub quiz, shuffleboard tournament,

929
00:43:42,680 --> 00:43:43,520
lots of fun.

930
00:43:43,520 --> 00:43:46,520
So okay, go to boatparty.biz right now

931
00:43:46,520 --> 00:43:47,360
and get your tickets.

932
00:43:47,360 --> 00:43:50,000
It's gonna be like pretty much the best.

933
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:52,080
So go do that right now.

934
00:43:52,080 --> 00:43:54,180
I feel like we've been able to keep it pretty cool

935
00:43:54,180 --> 00:43:58,480
if we meet people at Max Fun Con and shit like that,

936
00:43:58,480 --> 00:43:59,920
people we really admire.

937
00:43:59,920 --> 00:44:02,100
I don't think I could lock it down for Roderick.

938
00:44:02,100 --> 00:44:03,740
I do not think.

939
00:44:03,740 --> 00:44:04,580
I do not.

940
00:44:04,580 --> 00:44:06,200
It would be like a reprise of when

941
00:44:06,200 --> 00:44:08,400
Justin and I met John Hodgman

942
00:44:08,400 --> 00:44:11,480
and you embarrassed me just so, so bad.

943
00:44:11,480 --> 00:44:13,200
I did a great job.

944
00:44:13,200 --> 00:44:15,280
You did a really good job of taking a picture of us

945
00:44:15,280 --> 00:44:17,640
over and over again in a dark bar with flash on

946
00:44:17,640 --> 00:44:18,480
over and over and over.

947
00:44:18,480 --> 00:44:20,160
So funny.

948
00:44:20,160 --> 00:44:21,120
I treasure that picture.

949
00:44:21,120 --> 00:44:22,840
It's number one in my camera roll.

950
00:44:22,840 --> 00:44:25,200
Never get rid of it and I'll use it every day.

951
00:44:27,400 --> 00:44:28,720
Hi, my name is Ruchakay Sherway

952
00:44:28,720 --> 00:44:31,160
and I have a podcast called Song Exploder.

953
00:44:31,160 --> 00:44:33,760
In each episode, a musician takes apart one of their songs

954
00:44:33,760 --> 00:44:36,520
and piece by piece tells you the story of how it was made.

955
00:44:36,520 --> 00:44:38,080
You get an inside look into the creative

956
00:44:38,080 --> 00:44:40,320
and technical process and a unique view of a song

957
00:44:40,320 --> 00:44:41,560
by hearing just the drums

958
00:44:43,440 --> 00:44:44,500
or just the guitars

959
00:44:45,760 --> 00:44:47,820
or say just a Wurlitzer piano.

960
00:44:50,960 --> 00:44:52,880
If you're a fan of music, if you make music

961
00:44:52,880 --> 00:44:54,480
or if you just like to learn how things are made,

962
00:44:54,480 --> 00:44:56,580
come check it out on maximumfun.org.

963
00:44:56,580 --> 00:44:57,420
Thanks.

964
00:44:59,840 --> 00:45:01,240
How about a Yahoo?

965
00:45:01,240 --> 00:45:02,140
Yeah, please.

966
00:45:02,140 --> 00:45:05,940
This Yahoo was sent in by Ira Ray.

967
00:45:05,940 --> 00:45:07,780
Are you Ira Ray?

968
00:45:07,780 --> 00:45:09,300
Who wants to know?

969
00:45:09,300 --> 00:45:10,140
Thank you, Ira Ray.

970
00:45:10,140 --> 00:45:14,820
It's by Yahoo Answers user Mike B. who asks,

971
00:45:14,820 --> 00:45:17,280
who will take over for Jimmy Buffett?

972
00:45:19,820 --> 00:45:22,500
So I'm a huge Jimmy Buffett fan.

973
00:45:22,500 --> 00:45:24,300
I just love his laid back style.

974
00:45:24,300 --> 00:45:25,820
That makes you wish you were on a beach

975
00:45:25,820 --> 00:45:27,820
with a couple coronas and a boat.

976
00:45:27,820 --> 00:45:28,900
So hold up.

977
00:45:29,940 --> 00:45:31,020
Hold on.

978
00:45:31,020 --> 00:45:32,700
Don't, one second, my dude.

979
00:45:32,700 --> 00:45:34,500
You're on a beach.

980
00:45:34,500 --> 00:45:36,140
You're on the beach.

981
00:45:36,140 --> 00:45:38,340
You're on the loamy sands,

982
00:45:38,340 --> 00:45:40,620
kicking back a cup, dual fisting coronas.

983
00:45:40,620 --> 00:45:43,860
And then somewhere there's a boat just like.

984
00:45:43,860 --> 00:45:44,780
I think it's one of those things

985
00:45:44,780 --> 00:45:47,300
where it's like the boat has washed up onto the beach

986
00:45:47,300 --> 00:45:48,140
and it's flipped over.

987
00:45:48,140 --> 00:45:51,140
Maybe like there's a hermit crab crawling on the beach.

988
00:45:51,140 --> 00:45:55,100
It's just you on a beach, some babes, some ronas

989
00:45:55,100 --> 00:45:57,520
and an old, old rotten boat.

990
00:45:57,520 --> 00:46:02,440
Old, rotten boat full of sailor skeletons.

991
00:46:02,440 --> 00:46:07,440
Since his style is so unique and hard to match,

992
00:46:08,760 --> 00:46:11,960
I was just wondering if anyone had any ideas

993
00:46:11,960 --> 00:46:15,160
on who will take his place when he stops making music.

994
00:46:15,160 --> 00:46:17,360
Probably Stephen Colbert.

995
00:46:17,360 --> 00:46:22,240
Has anyone tried to match his styles?

996
00:46:22,240 --> 00:46:24,440
I'm pretty sure every musician ever just heard that

997
00:46:24,440 --> 00:46:28,920
and was like, ah, I'm not really interested in doing that.

998
00:46:28,920 --> 00:46:30,400
I actually think there's a,

999
00:46:30,400 --> 00:46:33,640
you could make a compelling case for Kenny Chesney.

1000
00:46:33,640 --> 00:46:36,960
As a suitable, like where,

1001
00:46:36,960 --> 00:46:39,880
if you look at the Kenny Chesney career path,

1002
00:46:39,880 --> 00:46:44,880
I think Kenny Chesney could take you down that road.

1003
00:46:46,320 --> 00:46:48,280
He's obviously more country inspired

1004
00:46:48,280 --> 00:46:49,440
than Jimmy Buffett.

1005
00:46:49,440 --> 00:46:51,600
I'm not gonna argue that with you right now.

1006
00:46:51,600 --> 00:46:56,520
But what I will say is that he has had a lot of tracks

1007
00:46:56,520 --> 00:47:01,520
that are in the milieu, if I may,

1008
00:47:02,200 --> 00:47:04,840
of a Jimmy Buffett.

1009
00:47:04,840 --> 00:47:06,640
I mean, obviously he's got the novelty hits.

1010
00:47:06,640 --> 00:47:07,920
See, he thinks my tracks are sexy.

1011
00:47:07,920 --> 00:47:08,880
Sure. Yeah.

1012
00:47:08,880 --> 00:47:09,720
Don't mind if I do.

1013
00:47:09,720 --> 00:47:10,920
But I mean that, but I mean,

1014
00:47:10,920 --> 00:47:15,920
has Jimmy Buffett ever written a non-novelty hit?

1015
00:47:16,120 --> 00:47:20,760
Yeah, Jimmy Buffett, he's a storyteller

1016
00:47:20,760 --> 00:47:23,360
and his music is transformative.

1017
00:47:23,360 --> 00:47:27,240
I'm not gonna let anybody who only knows Margaritaville

1018
00:47:27,240 --> 00:47:29,040
sit here and fucking dump on Jimmy Buffett.

1019
00:47:29,040 --> 00:47:30,200
Son of a, Son of a Sailor.

1020
00:47:30,200 --> 00:47:31,040
Son of a, Son of a Sailor.

1021
00:47:31,040 --> 00:47:32,560
Cheeseburger in Paradise. Cheeseburger in Paradise.

1022
00:47:32,560 --> 00:47:34,080
Yes, Son of a, Son of a Sailor.

1023
00:47:34,080 --> 00:47:37,140
It's not a novelty song, it's a song about growing up.

1024
00:47:37,140 --> 00:47:38,920
Jesus.

1025
00:47:38,920 --> 00:47:43,920
I'm saying that if Kenny Chesney ever drank a Corona

1026
00:47:44,360 --> 00:47:48,360
or a Margarita, he would age super fast and die

1027
00:47:48,360 --> 00:47:51,520
like the bad guy in Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade.

1028
00:47:51,520 --> 00:47:54,480
I think if anything slipped between those sweet country lips

1029
00:47:54,480 --> 00:47:57,880
other than a Bud Light, if he drank a Bud Light lime,

1030
00:47:57,880 --> 00:48:00,040
he would have seizures for two days.

1031
00:48:00,040 --> 00:48:02,720
Okay, I'm gonna hit you with,

1032
00:48:02,720 --> 00:48:06,840
I'm right now looking at Kenny Chesney's greatest hits too.

1033
00:48:06,840 --> 00:48:08,000
Okay?

1034
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:12,080
These are like just some of the tracks on Kenny Chesney

1035
00:48:12,080 --> 00:48:14,920
and tell me if you are not getting a Buffett vibe.

1036
00:48:14,920 --> 00:48:19,920
Out Last Night, Young, Summertime, Beer in Mexico,

1037
00:48:20,400 --> 00:48:25,280
When the Sun Goes Down, No Shoes, No Shirt, No Problems,

1038
00:48:25,280 --> 00:48:28,780
The Good Stuff, I'm a Live Duet with Dave Matthews.

1039
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:31,640
Especially that last one is super on the nose.

1040
00:48:31,640 --> 00:48:34,920
Hold on, I have to buy that last one on iTunes real quick

1041
00:48:34,920 --> 00:48:36,540
just so I can listen to it and make fun of it.

1042
00:48:36,540 --> 00:48:37,380
You know, it's.

1043
00:48:39,320 --> 00:48:40,360
Really, excuse me.

1044
00:48:40,360 --> 00:48:42,960
Sorry guys, Kenny Chesney is a slightly more

1045
00:48:42,960 --> 00:48:46,120
country influenced, slightly younger Jimmy Buffett.

1046
00:48:46,120 --> 00:48:47,560
Jimmy Buffett's.

1047
00:48:47,560 --> 00:48:51,200
When you have a track called No Shirt, No Shoes, No Problem,

1048
00:48:51,200 --> 00:48:53,280
you're setting yourself up as like the prince.

1049
00:48:53,280 --> 00:48:54,800
Is that a Buffett cover?

1050
00:48:55,760 --> 00:48:58,040
Buffett actually called him after like,

1051
00:48:58,040 --> 00:49:00,040
hold on there buckaroo, hold up.

1052
00:49:00,040 --> 00:49:01,320
I gotta check my song list

1053
00:49:01,320 --> 00:49:02,400
because that might be one of mine.

1054
00:49:02,400 --> 00:49:05,200
I ain't ready to kick yet, I might have already done that one.

1055
00:49:08,200 --> 00:49:12,920
I just think about like if I'm kicking it in a hammock

1056
00:49:12,920 --> 00:49:14,680
on a beach.

1057
00:49:14,680 --> 00:49:15,520
With a boat.

1058
00:49:15,520 --> 00:49:18,160
With an old, old rotten skeleton filled boat.

1059
00:49:19,060 --> 00:49:22,160
And then I hear like a steel guitar.

1060
00:49:22,160 --> 00:49:24,800
It's gonna bring me out of my vibe a little bit.

1061
00:49:24,800 --> 00:49:29,800
I'm saying thematically, yes, the ideas espoused

1062
00:49:30,100 --> 00:49:34,240
in Kenny Chesney's works are certainly.

1063
00:49:34,240 --> 00:49:36,280
The man has a Christmas album

1064
00:49:36,280 --> 00:49:40,240
called All I Want for Christmas is a Real Good Tan.

1065
00:49:40,240 --> 00:49:42,320
After he published an album with that title,

1066
00:49:42,320 --> 00:49:45,080
he had to get a fucking DNA test

1067
00:49:45,080 --> 00:49:48,120
to make sure he was not Jimmy Buffett's son.

1068
00:49:48,120 --> 00:49:48,960
Legally speaking.

1069
00:49:48,960 --> 00:49:53,020
You're saying if Jimmy Buffett committed a heinous murder,

1070
00:49:53,020 --> 00:49:56,040
then Kenny Chesney could be convicted of the crime.

1071
00:49:56,040 --> 00:49:57,380
Have you guys seen Looper?

1072
00:50:04,560 --> 00:50:06,760
I'm just saying, is it possible?

1073
00:50:06,760 --> 00:50:08,000
Oh man.

1074
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:09,880
I mean, there's only one solution, right?

1075
00:50:09,880 --> 00:50:13,200
We have to cut off Kenny Chesney's hands.

1076
00:50:13,200 --> 00:50:18,040
And then we will see if Jimmy Buffett responds.

1077
00:50:18,040 --> 00:50:21,760
The man released a CD called Just Who I Am,

1078
00:50:21,760 --> 00:50:24,360
Poets and Pirates, okay?

1079
00:50:25,640 --> 00:50:26,800
Oh, this is a fun game.

1080
00:50:26,800 --> 00:50:27,640
You should set up a game

1081
00:50:27,640 --> 00:50:29,200
where you just read like song titles.

1082
00:50:29,200 --> 00:50:30,040
Okay, okay.

1083
00:50:30,040 --> 00:50:31,240
And then we have to guess if it's Buffett.

1084
00:50:31,240 --> 00:50:32,080
This is great.

1085
00:50:32,080 --> 00:50:32,900
This is great.

1086
00:50:32,900 --> 00:50:33,800
Okay, hold on a second.

1087
00:50:33,800 --> 00:50:35,520
All right, so we're back.

1088
00:50:35,520 --> 00:50:37,480
Here is the game.

1089
00:50:37,480 --> 00:50:42,240
I am going to tell you titles of songs.

1090
00:50:42,240 --> 00:50:45,680
You're going to tell me if it is a Jimmy Buffett song

1091
00:50:45,680 --> 00:50:47,120
or Kenny Chesney song.

1092
00:50:47,120 --> 00:50:48,080
Are you ready?

1093
00:50:48,080 --> 00:50:50,440
Yes, I am ready.

1094
00:50:50,440 --> 00:50:51,980
Can I use the internet?

1095
00:50:52,920 --> 00:50:53,740
What?

1096
00:50:53,740 --> 00:50:54,580
No, you cannot.

1097
00:50:54,580 --> 00:50:55,400
What are you talking about?

1098
00:50:55,400 --> 00:50:57,000
No, here we go.

1099
00:50:59,600 --> 00:51:02,040
Grapefruit, juicy fruit.

1100
00:51:02,040 --> 00:51:04,280
Definitely, definitely Jimmy Buffett.

1101
00:51:04,280 --> 00:51:05,840
Chesney.

1102
00:51:05,840 --> 00:51:07,640
It is Jimmy Buffett.

1103
00:51:07,640 --> 00:51:09,160
Ah.

1104
00:51:09,160 --> 00:51:11,960
Guitars and tiki bars.

1105
00:51:11,960 --> 00:51:14,640
Definitely, 100% Jimmy Buffett.

1106
00:51:14,640 --> 00:51:15,640
Buffett.

1107
00:51:15,640 --> 00:51:17,360
Sorry, that's Kenneth Chesney.

1108
00:51:17,360 --> 00:51:20,040
Ah, Kenneth, Kenneth.

1109
00:51:21,520 --> 00:51:22,880
You fucked me, Kenneth.

1110
00:51:22,880 --> 00:51:24,360
Here we go again.

1111
00:51:24,360 --> 00:51:26,760
Sherry's Livin' in Paradise.

1112
00:51:26,760 --> 00:51:28,280
If it has paradise in it,

1113
00:51:28,280 --> 00:51:30,280
fucking Jimmy Buffett owns a trademark.

1114
00:51:30,280 --> 00:51:32,640
No, it's Chesney and I bet it's actually

1115
00:51:32,640 --> 00:51:34,000
about someone being dead.

1116
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:36,200
Ah, that's Kenny Chesney.

1117
00:51:36,200 --> 00:51:37,160
God damn it.

1118
00:51:37,160 --> 00:51:38,600
Here we go another one.

1119
00:51:38,600 --> 00:51:40,480
I'll guess Chesney on the next one.

1120
00:51:40,480 --> 00:51:42,400
Okay, this is an easy one.

1121
00:51:42,400 --> 00:51:43,400
Okay.

1122
00:51:43,400 --> 00:51:45,800
Changes in latitudes, changes in attitudes.

1123
00:51:45,800 --> 00:51:47,860
Definitely Jimmy Buffett.

1124
00:51:47,860 --> 00:51:48,700
Buffett.

1125
00:51:48,700 --> 00:51:49,520
Correct, that's Buffett.

1126
00:51:49,520 --> 00:51:50,360
That's a good one.

1127
00:51:50,360 --> 00:51:51,520
I twisted it on you because you thought

1128
00:51:51,520 --> 00:51:52,440
you were going to trick me

1129
00:51:52,440 --> 00:51:54,920
because I said I was going to guess Chesney.

1130
00:51:54,920 --> 00:51:56,620
Pencil thin mustache.

1131
00:51:56,620 --> 00:51:57,460
Chesney?

1132
00:51:58,700 --> 00:51:59,540
Buffett.

1133
00:51:59,540 --> 00:52:00,800
No, that's Jimmy Buffett.

1134
00:52:00,800 --> 00:52:02,180
Fuck me, damn it.

1135
00:52:02,180 --> 00:52:03,720
I thought, there's no way Jimmy Buffett

1136
00:52:03,720 --> 00:52:06,800
would sing about such wispy facial hair.

1137
00:52:09,680 --> 00:52:11,160
Brown eyed girl.

1138
00:52:11,160 --> 00:52:12,360
Jimmy Buffett.

1139
00:52:13,660 --> 00:52:16,500
And no Van Morrison, but good try.

1140
00:52:18,840 --> 00:52:20,480
Okay, just a couple more

1141
00:52:20,480 --> 00:52:22,620
because this is a slam dunk game.

1142
00:52:24,360 --> 00:52:26,060
Last mango in Paris.

1143
00:52:28,040 --> 00:52:28,880
Chesney?

1144
00:52:28,880 --> 00:52:29,700
See, I'm going to say Chesney

1145
00:52:29,700 --> 00:52:32,200
because that sounds so much like a Jimmy Buffett song.

1146
00:52:32,200 --> 00:52:35,100
That is actually James Buffett.

1147
00:52:37,800 --> 00:52:39,600
That fucking dick.

1148
00:52:39,600 --> 00:52:43,240
He all he has to say is the name of a food and a place.

1149
00:52:43,240 --> 00:52:44,440
And it's a song.

1150
00:52:44,440 --> 00:52:49,080
He's like the Elvis Costello of putting food in places.

1151
00:52:49,080 --> 00:52:50,600
Okay, I'm going to hit,

1152
00:52:50,600 --> 00:52:51,880
we're going to go to the lightning round.

1153
00:52:51,880 --> 00:52:52,720
You ready?

1154
00:52:52,720 --> 00:52:53,540
Yes.

1155
00:52:53,540 --> 00:52:54,380
Ready for the lightning round.

1156
00:52:54,380 --> 00:52:55,220
How has this not been the lightning round

1157
00:52:55,220 --> 00:52:56,040
the whole time though?

1158
00:52:56,040 --> 00:52:56,920
This is the lightning round.

1159
00:52:56,920 --> 00:52:58,560
Are you ready?

1160
00:52:58,560 --> 00:52:59,400
Lightning round.

1161
00:52:59,400 --> 00:53:00,640
And here's the thing about the lightning round.

1162
00:53:00,640 --> 00:53:02,200
You guys have to agree.

1163
00:53:02,200 --> 00:53:03,400
You can't just each pick a different one.

1164
00:53:03,400 --> 00:53:04,240
You have to agree on it.

1165
00:53:04,240 --> 00:53:05,060
Here we go.

1166
00:53:05,060 --> 00:53:06,800
So the lightning round will be categorically slower.

1167
00:53:06,800 --> 00:53:07,640
Slower.

1168
00:53:07,640 --> 00:53:08,460
Slower.

1169
00:53:08,460 --> 00:53:09,300
Here we go.

1170
00:53:09,300 --> 00:53:10,140
Here we go.

1171
00:53:10,140 --> 00:53:11,840
Life is good.

1172
00:53:11,840 --> 00:53:12,680
Buffett?

1173
00:53:12,680 --> 00:53:13,500
I'm going Chesney.

1174
00:53:13,500 --> 00:53:14,340
Oh, fuck me.

1175
00:53:14,340 --> 00:53:15,180
God damn it, Travis.

1176
00:53:15,180 --> 00:53:16,000
When are we going to get together on anything?

1177
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:16,840
Come with me.

1178
00:53:16,840 --> 00:53:17,680
Come with me on this, Griffin.

1179
00:53:17,680 --> 00:53:19,680
I'll go with Travis on the Chesney Express.

1180
00:53:19,680 --> 00:53:20,520
Kenny Chesney.

1181
00:53:20,520 --> 00:53:21,360
Yeah.

1182
00:53:21,360 --> 00:53:22,180
Yes.

1183
00:53:22,180 --> 00:53:23,020
Big call, Travis.

1184
00:53:23,020 --> 00:53:23,920
Soul of a sailor.

1185
00:53:23,920 --> 00:53:26,720
Ooh, see, that sounds so, but wait.

1186
00:53:26,720 --> 00:53:27,820
Buffett, okay.

1187
00:53:27,820 --> 00:53:29,400
Buffett sucks ass, right?

1188
00:53:29,400 --> 00:53:30,240
We can agree on that.

1189
00:53:30,240 --> 00:53:31,060
Buffett's terrible.

1190
00:53:31,060 --> 00:53:32,140
He's not a good musician.

1191
00:53:32,140 --> 00:53:33,460
I don't think he's so bad though

1192
00:53:33,460 --> 00:53:34,540
that he would release a song called

1193
00:53:34,540 --> 00:53:35,560
Son of a son of a sailor.

1194
00:53:35,560 --> 00:53:38,760
And then also, unless it's the fucking sequel.

1195
00:53:38,760 --> 00:53:40,800
Here's the sequel to my last joint hit.

1196
00:53:41,760 --> 00:53:42,600
Also about to-

1197
00:53:42,600 --> 00:53:43,740
Right, you guys are wrong.

1198
00:53:43,740 --> 00:53:45,560
But anyway, go ahead.

1199
00:53:45,560 --> 00:53:47,240
Go ahead with your wrongness.

1200
00:53:47,240 --> 00:53:48,680
Stick with Buffett.

1201
00:53:48,680 --> 00:53:49,700
Buffett.

1202
00:53:49,700 --> 00:53:50,600
It's Kenny Chesney.

1203
00:53:50,600 --> 00:53:52,460
God damn you, Justin.

1204
00:53:53,520 --> 00:53:54,980
You can't, Alec Trebek isn't like,

1205
00:53:54,980 --> 00:53:56,980
are you sure about that answer, pussy?

1206
00:53:58,000 --> 00:53:59,660
You sure you want to go with that one, pussy?

1207
00:53:59,660 --> 00:54:01,000
Okay, stupid.

1208
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:02,980
And then they change and he's like, I just got you.

1209
00:54:02,980 --> 00:54:04,860
Turn out the light and love me tonight.

1210
00:54:04,860 --> 00:54:06,060
Kenny Chesney.

1211
00:54:06,060 --> 00:54:07,980
That's gotta be Chesney.

1212
00:54:07,980 --> 00:54:09,440
That's Kenny Chesney.

1213
00:54:09,440 --> 00:54:11,060
Yes.

1214
00:54:11,060 --> 00:54:12,280
Boat drinks.

1215
00:54:12,280 --> 00:54:16,580
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, one more time.

1216
00:54:16,580 --> 00:54:17,620
Not a tune.

1217
00:54:17,620 --> 00:54:18,600
Boat drinks.

1218
00:54:18,600 --> 00:54:19,440
Not a track.

1219
00:54:19,440 --> 00:54:20,280
Boat sipping.

1220
00:54:21,400 --> 00:54:22,940
I'm gonna go trick question.

1221
00:54:23,840 --> 00:54:27,860
All right, this is the point at which Griffin edits in

1222
00:54:27,860 --> 00:54:29,440
a little bit of boat drinks.

1223
00:54:29,440 --> 00:54:30,440
Boat drinks.

1224
00:54:31,760 --> 00:54:34,840
Boys in the van ordered boat drinks.

1225
00:54:34,840 --> 00:54:36,480
By James Buffett.

1226
00:54:38,640 --> 00:54:39,960
No.

1227
00:54:39,960 --> 00:54:41,240
From the album Volcano.

1228
00:54:41,240 --> 00:54:43,480
Sunshine Coconut Women.

1229
00:54:43,480 --> 00:54:45,280
All right, that was the.

1230
00:54:45,280 --> 00:54:46,260
Sandy butts.

1231
00:54:46,260 --> 00:54:47,680
Beach Ball Corona Hour.

1232
00:54:49,760 --> 00:54:52,040
I just really, what I'm pointing out is.

1233
00:54:52,040 --> 00:54:54,160
Poultry swaying, beach babes playing.

1234
00:54:54,160 --> 00:54:57,860
Pointing out is that James Buffett is the shittiest.

1235
00:54:57,860 --> 00:55:01,280
Boat drinks.

1236
00:55:01,280 --> 00:55:02,800
That's gonna do it for us here on my brother,

1237
00:55:02,800 --> 00:55:04,440
my brother and me.

1238
00:55:04,440 --> 00:55:05,640
Advice show for the modern era.

1239
00:55:05,640 --> 00:55:09,600
We hope you've had as much fun as we have here.

1240
00:55:10,920 --> 00:55:14,200
Thank you to Squarespace and Harry's.com

1241
00:55:14,200 --> 00:55:16,000
for their stewardship.

1242
00:55:16,880 --> 00:55:19,460
And make sure to go check out BoatParty.biz.

1243
00:55:19,460 --> 00:55:22,040
Yeah, BoatParty.biz, go get your tickets to that.

1244
00:55:23,160 --> 00:55:25,480
Big thanks to everybody who bought tickets

1245
00:55:25,480 --> 00:55:29,040
to the other show that we had that went up.

1246
00:55:29,040 --> 00:55:32,420
I know not everyone still got tickets to go.

1247
00:55:32,420 --> 00:55:37,180
I really hope that people like honored our request

1248
00:55:37,180 --> 00:55:38,480
not to buy tickets if you already had tickets

1249
00:55:38,480 --> 00:55:39,380
to the other one.

1250
00:55:39,380 --> 00:55:41,060
Because like to me, it was fucking crazy

1251
00:55:41,060 --> 00:55:42,360
how fast they sold out.

1252
00:55:44,280 --> 00:55:46,560
If we see you at all three shows, we will humiliate you.

1253
00:55:46,560 --> 00:55:47,760
We'll embarrass you.

1254
00:55:47,760 --> 00:55:50,040
We'll memorize the faces at each show.

1255
00:55:50,040 --> 00:55:52,120
And we will humiliate you in front of everyone.

1256
00:55:52,120 --> 00:55:53,680
And then we will have you escorted.

1257
00:55:53,680 --> 00:55:54,880
No, we won't do that.

1258
00:55:54,880 --> 00:55:58,320
That's gonna be a very fun, very long day for us.

1259
00:55:58,320 --> 00:56:00,280
I guess apologies to the people who bought tickets

1260
00:56:00,280 --> 00:56:01,780
to the last show.

1261
00:56:01,780 --> 00:56:04,260
Because you're gonna be getting the snickle fritz

1262
00:56:04,260 --> 00:56:05,100
at that point.

1263
00:56:05,100 --> 00:56:06,560
No, that's gonna be the one where we're drunk.

1264
00:56:06,560 --> 00:56:08,280
Yeah, that's gonna be the punch drunk,

1265
00:56:08,280 --> 00:56:10,000
you know, spaghetti-getting stuff.

1266
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:11,600
Don't promise people spaghetti-getting

1267
00:56:11,600 --> 00:56:12,720
if we can't deliver spaghetti-getting.

1268
00:56:12,720 --> 00:56:13,680
Spaghetti-getting too.

1269
00:56:13,680 --> 00:56:16,120
Somebody get a spaghetti between the four o'clock show

1270
00:56:16,120 --> 00:56:16,960
and the nine o'clock show.

1271
00:56:16,960 --> 00:56:17,800
That's what we're gonna feed you.

1272
00:56:17,800 --> 00:56:20,240
Get in your pockets, you dirty birds.

1273
00:56:20,240 --> 00:56:24,320
If everyone, if all 150 people bring a pocket full

1274
00:56:24,320 --> 00:56:28,440
of spaghetti, we could probably eat a whole table full.

1275
00:56:28,440 --> 00:56:31,400
And listen, if you come up to me thinking you're cute

1276
00:56:31,400 --> 00:56:33,720
and try to hand me spaghetti from your pocket,

1277
00:56:33,720 --> 00:56:35,280
I will fucking rabbit punch you.

1278
00:56:35,280 --> 00:56:38,940
And you will black out and spend our show

1279
00:56:38,940 --> 00:56:41,140
that you paid good money for in a coma.

1280
00:56:41,140 --> 00:56:43,880
That's my promise to you, the listener.

1281
00:56:44,880 --> 00:56:45,720
Don't do that.

1282
00:56:45,720 --> 00:56:46,920
But sorry if you didn't get in.

1283
00:56:46,920 --> 00:56:48,840
We'll do more shows up there.

1284
00:56:48,840 --> 00:56:52,780
Listen, we fucking, we slept on live shows for a while.

1285
00:56:52,780 --> 00:56:56,440
I guess we were kind of busy.

1286
00:56:56,440 --> 00:56:59,180
But I feel like we don't play the

1287
00:56:59,180 --> 00:57:01,260
we're just three guys card very often.

1288
00:57:01,260 --> 00:57:04,320
But we don't know fuck all about planning live events.

1289
00:57:04,320 --> 00:57:05,160
So like.

1290
00:57:05,160 --> 00:57:05,980
But we're trying to get on it.

1291
00:57:05,980 --> 00:57:07,580
You need to understand that when we do shit like this,

1292
00:57:07,580 --> 00:57:10,420
it is a crazy, crazy thing of us getting

1293
00:57:10,420 --> 00:57:13,400
like super, super outside of our comfort zone.

1294
00:57:13,400 --> 00:57:16,460
So like it's a big undertaking for us

1295
00:57:16,460 --> 00:57:18,520
to even do like a couple of these things a year.

1296
00:57:18,520 --> 00:57:19,540
But we're trying to do more of them

1297
00:57:19,540 --> 00:57:20,940
because we know we fucked up

1298
00:57:20,940 --> 00:57:24,020
and didn't get out to see you guys.

1299
00:57:24,020 --> 00:57:25,960
So we're gonna do more of it.

1300
00:57:27,160 --> 00:57:30,420
Also, if you know somebody who wants to be our manager,

1301
00:57:30,420 --> 00:57:32,300
who's like professional at it.

1302
00:57:32,300 --> 00:57:33,780
And who will do it for free.

1303
00:57:33,780 --> 00:57:34,620
He'll do it for free.

1304
00:57:34,620 --> 00:57:35,820
You guys are like, I'm not kidding.

1305
00:57:35,820 --> 00:57:38,900
I would, I mean, if we could take time off work

1306
00:57:38,900 --> 00:57:40,500
and like, if we had a tour manager,

1307
00:57:40,500 --> 00:57:44,060
like I would do, I would do a week or two with you dudes.

1308
00:57:44,060 --> 00:57:46,780
Why are we having like a meeting about this right now?

1309
00:57:46,780 --> 00:57:47,620
I'm just nervous.

1310
00:57:47,620 --> 00:57:48,860
Hey, everybody turn off the podcast for a minute.

1311
00:57:48,860 --> 00:57:49,700
Turn off the podcast for a minute.

1312
00:57:49,700 --> 00:57:50,520
So fellas.

1313
00:57:50,520 --> 00:57:53,140
We could do like a straight down the East coast,

1314
00:57:53,140 --> 00:57:57,340
start in Boston, go down, end in Vero Beach, Florida.

1315
00:57:57,340 --> 00:57:58,180
Mexico.

1316
00:57:58,180 --> 00:57:59,020
Oh, sorry.

1317
00:57:59,020 --> 00:57:59,840
Vero Beach?

1318
00:57:59,840 --> 00:58:00,680
Yes.

1319
00:58:00,680 --> 00:58:02,940
We have a lot of listeners in Vero Beach, Florida.

1320
00:58:02,940 --> 00:58:04,580
I have a boat that washed up there.

1321
00:58:04,580 --> 00:58:05,980
I've been meaning to get back to it.

1322
00:58:05,980 --> 00:58:07,260
It's full of old skeletons.

1323
00:58:07,260 --> 00:58:10,100
It's full of skeletons and weird crabs.

1324
00:58:11,780 --> 00:58:13,140
Yeah, so.

1325
00:58:13,140 --> 00:58:16,180
Listen, oh, if you have questions for the live show,

1326
00:58:16,180 --> 00:58:17,700
if you're gonna be there, start sending them in now.

1327
00:58:17,700 --> 00:58:19,540
Because we'll need a fuckload of them.

1328
00:58:19,540 --> 00:58:22,300
Yeah, because we've got to do three fucking shows that day.

1329
00:58:22,300 --> 00:58:23,940
Just make sure that like, if you're gonna be

1330
00:58:23,940 --> 00:58:26,340
at the 1.30 show or the four o'clock show

1331
00:58:26,340 --> 00:58:28,900
or the 9.30 show that you put that in the subject line.

1332
00:58:28,900 --> 00:58:31,100
So we can do it when you're actually there.

1333
00:58:32,180 --> 00:58:37,180
And if you want to be nice and offer your,

1334
00:58:37,220 --> 00:58:39,160
if you got tickets to more than one show

1335
00:58:39,160 --> 00:58:41,060
and you want to offer them out to people who didn't,

1336
00:58:41,060 --> 00:58:41,940
that would be great.

1337
00:58:41,940 --> 00:58:43,580
Sell them for 300%.

1338
00:58:43,580 --> 00:58:45,420
At a premium price.

1339
00:58:45,420 --> 00:58:46,900
Mark up value there.

1340
00:58:46,900 --> 00:58:50,140
I'm saying like $7,500 you could probably get.

1341
00:58:50,140 --> 00:58:52,980
And there also is gonna be like standby at the theater.

1342
00:58:52,980 --> 00:58:54,420
I think if you go by before the shows.

1343
00:58:54,420 --> 00:58:57,620
I would be very, very, very careful to like,

1344
00:58:57,620 --> 00:58:59,660
I don't think it's gonna be a substantial amount.

1345
00:58:59,660 --> 00:59:02,740
And like, there were a lot of people who didn't get tickets.

1346
00:59:02,740 --> 00:59:05,220
So like, definitely if you want to try for it, go for it.

1347
00:59:05,220 --> 00:59:08,460
But it is not a lock by any stretch of the imagination.

1348
00:59:08,460 --> 00:59:11,500
We promise that we are gonna come back very soon.

1349
00:59:11,500 --> 00:59:14,300
We underestimated the number of people

1350
00:59:14,300 --> 00:59:15,260
who would want to see us.

1351
00:59:15,260 --> 00:59:16,500
And that's a good problem to have,

1352
00:59:16,500 --> 00:59:19,260
but it's, that doesn't, you know,

1353
00:59:19,260 --> 00:59:20,940
it doesn't make it better for you.

1354
00:59:20,940 --> 00:59:23,580
So we promise we will come back very soon.

1355
00:59:23,580 --> 00:59:25,860
Now that we know how many of you want to see us

1356
00:59:25,860 --> 00:59:28,580
and also maybe we'll have somebody

1357
00:59:28,580 --> 00:59:29,660
who can actually like help us

1358
00:59:29,660 --> 00:59:31,860
and knows anything at all about anything.

1359
00:59:33,580 --> 00:59:34,500
I'm gonna think we already did it,

1360
00:59:34,500 --> 00:59:35,820
but John Roderick and the Long Winters

1361
00:59:35,820 --> 00:59:37,660
for the use of our theme song into departure,

1362
00:59:37,660 --> 00:59:40,340
which is only up and putting the days to bed.

1363
00:59:40,340 --> 00:59:42,580
Seriously guys, get that, get that album.

1364

No, every day.

1382
01:00:28,020 --> 01:00:31,420
that he did on his song, Beach Ball Fantasies.

1383
01:00:33,420 --> 01:00:36,820
Son of a, Spirit of a Beach Ball Fantasies, the sequel.

1384
01:00:38,980 --> 01:00:39,820
And that's gonna do it for us here.

1385
01:00:39,820 --> 01:00:41,300
Beach Ball's bouncing.

1386
01:00:41,300 --> 01:00:42,940
Sand Crab's pouncing.

1387
01:00:42,940 --> 01:00:43,780
Go ahead.

1388
01:00:43,780 --> 01:00:46,940
Griffin, Griffin's pouncing.

1389
01:00:46,940 --> 01:00:47,780
Do you have a last question?

1390
01:00:47,780 --> 01:00:49,060
This is the shittiest beach ever.

1391
01:00:49,060 --> 01:00:50,300
Just kidding, every beach is great.

1392
01:00:50,300 --> 01:00:51,200
I'm Jimmy Buffett.

1393
01:00:52,160 --> 01:00:53,120
Have a pineapple.

1394
01:00:54,900 --> 01:00:56,540
Eat this pineapple off my body.

1395
01:00:56,540 --> 01:00:58,740
Eat this pineapple off my body.

1396
01:00:58,740 --> 01:01:00,500
Okay, Griffin, last question.

1397
01:01:00,500 --> 01:01:01,740
That has to exist, right?

1398
01:01:01,740 --> 01:01:04,260
It's the last, probably yes.

1399
01:01:04,260 --> 01:01:05,860
This Yasu, this Yasu.

1400
01:01:06,860 --> 01:01:07,700

This Yadis Yahoo.

1403
01:01:10,980 --> 01:01:14,660
This Yahoo Night's Mystery was sent in by Alan Black.

1404
01:01:14,660 --> 01:01:15,500
Thank you, Alan.

1405
01:01:15,500 --> 01:01:19,080
It's by Yahoo Answers user, Cassandra, who asks,

1406
01:01:19,080 --> 01:01:21,140
what if an alien weapon caused you

1407
01:01:21,140 --> 01:01:23,440
to switch bladders with Taylor Swift?

1408
01:01:23,440 --> 01:01:24,280
What?

1409
01:01:27,020 --> 01:01:28,020
I'm Justin McElroy.

1410
01:01:28,020 --> 01:01:29,060
I'm Travis McElroy.

1411
01:01:29,060 --> 01:01:30,340
I'm Griffin McElroy.

1412
01:01:30,340 --> 01:01:31,180
It's been my brother, my brother.

1413
01:01:31,180 --> 01:01:32,300
May you kiss your dad.

1414
01:01:32,300 --> 01:01:33,360
Squirrel lips.

1415
01:01:33,360 --> 01:02:03,340
I am so proud to be an American and to be hosting Throwing Chains.

1416
01:02:03,340 --> 01:02:07,980
I am proud to have really deep brown eyes.

1417
01:02:07,980 --> 01:02:10,180
Well, this is actually supposed to be,

1418
01:02:10,180 --> 01:02:12,740
you know this is supposed to be a thing

1419
01:02:12,740 --> 01:02:13,580
so that people listen to our show.

1420
01:02:13,580 --> 01:02:15,340
Oh, so I've just been so busy this week.

1421
01:02:15,340 --> 01:02:16,180
Oh, okay.

1422
01:02:16,180 --> 01:02:17,020
But I'm very happy to be here.

1423
01:02:17,020 --> 01:02:18,460
The podcast is called?

1424
01:02:18,460 --> 01:02:19,420
It's called Throwing Shade.

1425
01:02:19,420 --> 01:02:20,260
You're the co-host, yeah.

1426
01:02:20,260 --> 01:02:21,700
So, Throwing Shade, we talk about.

1427
01:02:21,700 --> 01:02:23,900
You're the gay co-host, I'm the female co-host.

1428
01:02:23,900 --> 01:02:24,740
I always forget.

1429
01:02:24,740 --> 01:02:26,580
We're friends in real life, kind of.

1430
01:02:26,580 --> 01:02:29,020
And we talk about lady and gay issues.

1431
01:02:29,020 --> 01:02:29,860
Yeah.

1432
01:02:29,860 --> 01:02:30,780
And we talk about them in a way

1433
01:02:30,780 --> 01:02:33,180
that is really disrespectful.

1434
01:02:33,180 --> 01:02:35,620
Yeah, if you love the world and hate yourself.

1435
01:02:35,620 --> 01:02:37,020
Please listen to Throwing Shade.

1436
01:02:37,020 --> 01:03:04,020
Yeah.
