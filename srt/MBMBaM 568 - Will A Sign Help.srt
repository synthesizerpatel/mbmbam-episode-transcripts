1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,820
The McElroy brothers are not experts and their advice should never be followed

2
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:10,580
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it

3
00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:17,660
Also, this show isn't for kids which I mentioned only so the babies out there will know how cool they are for listening

4
00:00:17,660 --> 00:00:30,660
What's up, you cool, baby?

5
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:50,300
It's better it's better with you

6
00:00:53,980 --> 00:00:56,060
It's better it's better with you

7
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:02,300
Better it's better

8
00:01:10,820 --> 00:01:15,740
Hello everybody and welcome to my brother my brother and me and advice show for the modern era

9
00:01:15,740 --> 00:01:20,120
I'm your oldest brother Justin McElroy. I'm your middlest brother big dog

10
00:01:21,140 --> 00:01:28,740
Travis McElroy and I'm your sweet baby brother Griffin McElroy, you know here at my brother

11
00:01:28,740 --> 00:01:33,860
My brother and me industries. Yeah, the word of the day the word of the year the word of the business is of course

12
00:01:34,660 --> 00:01:38,880
Innovation we're always looking for new ways to help you the listener

13
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:46,200
Slash consumer and for a while there it was get you said at the beginning of the year. It was skin ovation and me

14
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:50,820
innovation and just like what's that and you were like poly weave fibers

15
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:57,920
Nano fiber weave on your skin that makes you bulletproof and swordproof and we were like, that's that's not real bud

16
00:01:58,360 --> 00:02:02,120
Yeah, but then you guys just brought me a lot about nudity like a lot

17
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:07,200
New kinds of nudity internal nudity. Yeah, you spelled it in

18
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:11,880
EWD which I liked don't get me wrong. I like that, right?

19
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:17,840
This time I figured out a new question and I think will help us

20
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:23,900
Answer questions for advice and maybe help the people at home and it's simple and that question is this

21
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:29,340
What a sign help and I was going through the question list today, right?

22
00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:33,060
I was making it and I thought how often that could be, you know

23
00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:38,120
There's like flow charts of answers. They have we're just like, you know, is it this if yes

24
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:45,040
Then this if no then this right and I think that we could ask would a sign help and that will be a good starting

25
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:52,040
Okay, a lot of questions like a sign like a billing vault situation or I mean listen

26
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:58,320
I don't want to limit what kind of sign it could be a billboard. It could be a traffic sign

27
00:02:58,320 --> 00:03:04,600
Oh, just like a written poster board thing. Okay, but if we can start from would a sign help?

28
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:11,720
We can build off of that and give ourselves a bit more of a foundation a foundation of rock if you will instead of sand

29
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:19,400
Okay, I feel we've been in the past. It sounds like maybe you just watched them that three billboards outside Bing bong, Wisconsin and

30
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:22,080
You know

31
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:27,920
I certainly that's not the title of it. I haven't watched two billboards yet. So I don't want to get there. Yeah. Yeah, you don't like it

32
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:33,000
Damn that would have been a good joke with that film was relevant a few years

33
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,600
I know right? Oh boy. Oh boy

34
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:43,680
As a short movie too because it's just Frances McDormand and she's already sweaty for putting up the first billboard and she puts it up

35
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:45,000
She's like damn this

36
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:49,320
I'm still not satisfied roll credits. Yeah, I gotta get some more billboards

37
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:54,400
I'm gonna need at least one more this first one says fuck Woody Harrelson and the next one says for real though

38
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:57,800
But I feel like I need a third one. That's like for real though

39
00:03:57,800 --> 00:04:04,240
And then well, I'm waiting for four billboards where the fourth one just says you just missed those last three billboards

40
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:06,920
Yeah, that was time to turn around and go back

41
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:13,760
Does Francis McDormand's awesome billboard slamming Woody Harrelson work just did say something like that?

42
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:21,240
I I wish I have more I wish people did that to Woody Harrelson all the time for different reasons all over the cut

43
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:26,440
Oh, that's good. I wish it wasn't just his character. I wish it was like about another zombie land Woody. Yeah, Woody

44
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:31,960
Hey, hey Woody make a third zombie land. I didn't watch the second one cuz I want to watch the trilogy

45
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:33,960
Yeah one setting. Yeah

46
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:39,240
I'm gonna show him back to back in the movie theaters, you know, yeah, I was just intended house map

47
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:45,960
And Matt McConaughey do a bud and you put it right outside his house not Matt McConaughey's house, but yeah

48
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:53,580
Is Matt McConaughey gonna be your governor? Matt McConaughey would be I would say a step up

49
00:04:53,580 --> 00:04:55,880
Maybe not the ideal candidate for the job

50
00:04:56,120 --> 00:05:01,080
But right now the candidate for the job who has the job is a real stinker

51
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:07,280
So a bucket of what hamburgers push down a flight of stairs would be a better governor than you got right now

52
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:09,280
That's not an unfair

53
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:11,520
Comparison, it's not an unfair thing to say

54
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:14,320
but yeah, I mean I

55
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:18,600
Shit, man, if that's what if that's the way we go if that's the way we go with it

56
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:20,600
I can but can we talk about?

57
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:27,120
How it directly affects this program. Yeah, if Matt McConaughey becomes your

58
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:32,800
Official governor he's basically it should be noted already the governor of Huntington

59
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:38,560
Yeah, cuz he made a movie about Marshall here and he's 12 years ago. I think yeah, like a hundred years ago

60
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:45,440
He's now all of her dad. Yeah, but like if he becomes your the governator over there, you know, well, we wouldn't call him that

61
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:54,100
Yeah, but like what happens to this program my brother my brother be if if frequently there's something going on where Matt

62
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:57,720
McConaughey is your

63
00:05:58,520 --> 00:06:02,600
Governor, I mean, I'm just worried that it's gonna eat up his time to make car commercials and stuff

64
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:04,880
Like when he'll get down

65
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:10,260
That Lincoln money that Lincoln my spins Austin's got beautiful rolling hills for

66
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:12,880
Lincoln lawyer that Lincoln was like

67
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:21,800
Okay, it's at least how it started okay, they he thinks he's still filming the movie. Yeah, he's like wins out of Lincoln lawyer sequel

68
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:23,800
Good arrive. All right

69
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:29,160
Lincoln lawyer 2 comes out if you haven't watched all the Lincoln car commercials ARG

70
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:32,640
You're gonna have missed out on a lot

71
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:39,120
To follow the hunt of the car of the man behind the wheel

72
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:43,080
Org yeah for it slash Matt McConaughey for gov

73
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:46,460
with four V's the adventure begins

74
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:54,520
He gets there and at the end you win a coupon for a free scoop of Baskin Robbins. Yeah, which is nice. I

75
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:58,560
Hope he has your vote. I don't know. He's but can I be honest? I don't know

76
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:05,280
Politics don't know this platform doesn't matter. He's Matthew McConaughey. I can fill in the blanks a lot. Yeah, I

77
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:07,960
bet he's part of the

78
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:10,320
green party

79
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:14,120
You know what? I hope he's not a member of all right. All right. All right. All right

80
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:22,120
Fuck it took a while to get there

81
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:30,360
Yeah, see you sign out. Yep. You're right. I'm an artist lately. I've been studying architecture as a hobby

82
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:33,720
Oh, I live within biking distance. That's cool. Yeah, it's cool. Badass

83
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:38,840
didn't it seem like that would be that's one that I wish I could sit down for like an hour and

84
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:43,280
Be able to point at buildings to be like, hmm neoclassical. Oh, right, right, right

85
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:46,360
Oh, that'd be cool. Now. Here's the thing Justin. Can I tell you something?

86
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:49,080
99% of time you can do that

87
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:53,800
Because the person you're talking to chances that they know if you're right or wrong very slam

88
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:57,320
But I'd know and that's gonna that's not gonna boost my confidence

89
00:07:57,800 --> 00:08:00,600
On the street and be like, oh, that's a big one. Oh, yeah

90
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:08,760
It would be like if imagine the time I've spent learning about Disney World was applied to the real world. Oh, yeah

91
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:12,600
Sure. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Imagine if the way I am when we walk around Disney World

92
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:13,360
I'm like, you know

93
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:19,440
That's actually the is the the the letters on that window advertising that fake business are actually reference to one of the original

94
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:25,000
Lawyers of the Disney World team imagine if I was like that but like for like smart shit like

95
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:30,680
That's how an architect feels when they're walking around Disney with you and they're like, why did I waste time?

96
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:34,320
I'm learning about architecture. I could have learned about Disney like Justin does he so cool

97
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:37,080
It'd be so good. It's got architecture in it too is the problem

98
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:40,220
Yeah, I mean and very rarely does architecture have Disney in it

99
00:08:40,220 --> 00:08:46,500
Just imagine walking around Chicago and pointing out the big buildings and be like, hmm. Yeah, that's a mid-century David Hyde Pierce

100
00:08:47,060 --> 00:08:51,080
Man remind me to tell you guys about the email we got about Frazier's theme song. No. No, I know

101
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:54,900
I live within biking distance of a couple of old

102
00:08:55,900 --> 00:09:02,500
Architecturally interesting weird houses and I would love to sit and draw them and take some notes on the architectural features

103
00:09:02,980 --> 00:09:06,580
However, I don't think this would endear me to the occupants very much

104
00:09:06,580 --> 00:09:13,660
How can I complete my self-directed studies without coming off as a huge creep? That's some suspicious student in Stony Brook

105
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:18,960
Okay, can I ask a stupid question? Yeah, and it's very obvious. So it must be like a stupid. Yeah, like why?

106
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:24,480
What is the I don't know. I don't do like this kind of art. I'm more of an audio artist

107
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:29,340
Yeah, how how does why can't you just take a picture then draw based on the picture good question

108
00:09:29,340 --> 00:09:33,060
So I actually in college as part of a scene design class

109
00:09:33,060 --> 00:09:40,960
we had to go and like draw buildings on campus and it's about like angles and getting the right like

110
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:44,600
Getting the right perspective so that you can pair lines

111
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:48,680
Yes compared to other things and changing your point of view and shit like that. Yeah

112
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:53,720
And with so you got to kind of do it. Well with the photo you don't always get the depth

113
00:09:53,720 --> 00:10:02,040
Oh, yeah, there should be a way to like have photos that like fucking move. Yeah, so you can like get the

114
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:04,040
Well, that's also not as fun

115
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:07,520
That's you know, it's not as fun. It's also not gonna get you put into artist jail

116
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:12,040
Yeah, just where we put people who do art. Well, so here's the question. Yeah, what a sign help

117
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:18,700
That sign you just had a sign set up next to you. Hey, wait a minute now wait

118
00:10:18,700 --> 00:10:25,540
This is a good question to start asking if you put up a sign that said basically like

119
00:10:27,260 --> 00:10:29,260
Doing our building artist over here

120
00:10:29,340 --> 00:10:30,360
Yeah

121
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:38,220
Building our building artist ask me anything and then a little hat because I think people are more comfortable if commerce is involved

122
00:10:40,780 --> 00:10:46,060
Wait, you're just doing this to make yourself happy. No this I will drop

123
00:10:46,060 --> 00:10:48,840
Okay, I got I got I got I got it

124
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:56,340
You sit down. Uh-huh. You get your pad your pen a cup of joe and then you start drawing the houses, right?

125
00:10:56,340 --> 00:11:00,000
Yes, and then you have a sign that says I will draw

126
00:11:01,300 --> 00:11:08,940
This building for $5. Yeah, and if someone comes over and they're like, here's $5. You just be like choice

127
00:11:08,980 --> 00:11:11,880
Thanks. Here's the building on it working on it. I'm on it

128
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:16,980
I'm working on it and they'll be like should I come back later for my drawings like, you know, get the drawing

129
00:11:16,980 --> 00:11:24,020
I'm just I'm drawing. Yeah, baby. $5. I'm drawing. You're not offering anything. I'm asked. Yeah, and you don't get

130
00:11:24,460 --> 00:11:29,420
It doesn't matter if anyone ever does it because you never see a kid like a caricature

131
00:11:29,820 --> 00:11:36,140
Artist is always you see him as sometimes a dizzy world and caricature artists is always sketching something

132
00:11:36,140 --> 00:11:38,140
Yeah, you never show you of course

133
00:11:38,140 --> 00:11:43,940
But they don't just sit there and stare at you and so like you hey, you've got a great chin for caricature

134
00:11:43,940 --> 00:11:47,540
Come on over like they're working on stuff. You're always interrupting a caricature

135
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:53,320
I think that it's weird how many times a caricature wait, wait, wait, wait, both of you are talking at once Griffin

136
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:56,300
You had a question. Do you think what's your question?

137
00:11:56,300 --> 00:12:01,680
Do you think that there are caricature artists and that's the ones that do house drawings, but they do them all

138
00:12:02,180 --> 00:12:07,200
Exaggerated and silly like the windows wicked big regret. I regret coming to you Griffin

139
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:09,380
Now we're going to hear what Travis had excellent

140
00:12:09,380 --> 00:12:15,780
Do you think it's really frustrating when you're like Beyonce and you sit down at a caricature artist and the caricature artist finishes and Beyonce's?

141
00:12:15,780 --> 00:12:18,900
Like I'll take that please and the character artist is like no, this is really good

142
00:12:18,900 --> 00:12:23,540
I'm gonna put it up to display my talent and Beyonce just has to walk away without her drawing

143
00:12:23,580 --> 00:12:27,700
But I don't think that Beyonce usually does sit for those kinds of yeah

144
00:12:27,700 --> 00:12:31,900
But they always have one of Beyonce don't they some point she wants to come by got terminator

145
00:12:31,900 --> 00:12:36,580
They got Beyonce because this Travis has just explained is an excruciating detail

146
00:12:36,580 --> 00:12:39,500
You can't draw based on a picture of Beyonce. Correct. You got to have

147
00:12:40,620 --> 00:12:42,620
That's why they look like they do

148
00:12:43,540 --> 00:12:48,380
They're like, oh no, the perspectives all wrong. Her head is trying it wouldn't it be so funny

149
00:12:48,380 --> 00:12:51,940
If Charlie Chaplin walked up and he was like, I'll take that one of me. That's really good

150
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:54,220
That's me, sir

151
00:12:54,220 --> 00:12:56,480
I'll purchase and then go also

152
00:12:56,480 --> 00:13:01,020
Why did you draw me knowing this and then fucking Gilbert Godfrey walks by and drops off a picture of himself?

153
00:13:01,100 --> 00:13:06,340
That is just with those same one picture that every caricature artist has he's just walking around the country dropping those off

154
00:13:06,340 --> 00:13:08,180
Like Johnny Appleseed

155
00:13:08,180 --> 00:13:13,020
He drew them himself and he's like you can display this as your work. I'm like, I guess

156
00:13:13,900 --> 00:13:20,580
Okay, if you're outside somebody's house drawing it would assign help and this but the sign says like hey

157
00:13:20,580 --> 00:13:23,060
I'm not jerking off out here. You

158
00:13:23,620 --> 00:13:29,080
Guaranteed nothing everything is aboveboard. I'm just sketching for a non

159
00:13:30,020 --> 00:13:31,380
jerk off

160
00:13:31,380 --> 00:13:36,580
Publication promise promise promise to the max, but damn it. Somebody could wear that sign that

161
00:13:37,180 --> 00:13:43,520
And be jerking that is gonna plan on doing that. Well, this is that this is one of the intricacies of the question

162
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:49,100
What a sign help because yeah, like if you just wrote I'm drawing the house, right?

163
00:13:49,100 --> 00:13:54,620
That's not as bad as I'm drawing the house Steven Johnson who lives in it. Yeah now

164
00:13:55,300 --> 00:13:59,940
Now it's weird. Now. It's a problem. We need to get these signs notarized

165
00:13:59,940 --> 00:14:03,740
Yeah, you need a sign that says hey, I'm not jerking off down here

166
00:14:03,740 --> 00:14:10,660
And then there's like two signatories on the bottom and like a seal from the mayor. That's like, yep

167
00:14:10,660 --> 00:14:15,060
He's not he's not jerking off out here. He's just drawing. I promise trust me. I'm the mayor

168
00:14:15,660 --> 00:14:19,860
How about another question? Yes, I know this is unorthodox. Okay

169
00:14:20,780 --> 00:14:26,200
But why not? Okay. Well, I would actually can I do this wiki how article cuz let me tell you something about this fucking website guys

170
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:30,780
Let me tell you something. Let me get well, no, but let me that was so much wasted

171
00:14:30,780 --> 00:14:34,500
Oh, no, but listen, I gotta tell you something about this website. It uses

172
00:14:35,220 --> 00:14:36,540
more

173
00:14:36,540 --> 00:14:38,620
fucking RAM on my

174
00:14:39,700 --> 00:14:41,940
considerably beefy rig then

175
00:14:43,460 --> 00:14:52,060
Ableton then the 90 audacity windows. I have open then I could be running fucking Halo 9 on this PC or

176
00:14:52,060 --> 00:14:56,940
I'm on my computer and it would fucking not use as much RAM as wiki

177
00:14:56,940 --> 00:15:00,540
How my fan is screaming cuz it's like look at all these poor images

178
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:06,580
So I want to finish this and close this so that the audio will be better. Is that okay? Okay. Okay good

179
00:15:06,580 --> 00:15:10,060
I I found this one on wiki how and it's about

180
00:15:10,780 --> 00:15:15,500
Cat behavior communicating with cats, which is okay a rich rich vein on wiki

181
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:22,660
How I think it's maybe just cuz people like to draw kitties and the title of the article is how to apologize to a cat. Thank

182
00:15:22,780 --> 00:15:24,180
apologize to a cat

183
00:15:24,180 --> 00:15:28,700
Step one is my cat's birthday and I've been wondering. Oh, well, this is gonna be great for you

184
00:15:28,700 --> 00:15:31,420
This is more about like I accidentally, you know

185
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:35,140
You know bumped into him in the middle of the night and pissed him off or whatever

186
00:15:35,140 --> 00:15:37,820
I rubbed there for the wrong way because I've never touched a cat before

187
00:15:38,300 --> 00:15:43,020
So more physical sliding and not so much emotional exactly determine the offense

188
00:15:43,020 --> 00:15:45,780
What did you do to make your cat matters you make fun of her?

189
00:15:46,420 --> 00:15:48,420
Fucking oh, okay. Wait

190
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:53,940
You're back in. Yeah, if you offend your cat by making fun of her, you'll probably have to offer some treats and praise

191
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:56,120
yeah, your cats definitely

192
00:15:57,060 --> 00:16:01,120
Understands English enough to say like your butthole stinks. Mr. Chis Chisker's

193
00:16:05,460 --> 00:16:07,460
Chisker's and then

194
00:16:07,460 --> 00:16:13,180
You gotta choose a good time to apologize if the cat's angry not now approaching to see me busy

195
00:16:13,340 --> 00:16:16,860
If the cat's busy not right now, it's Steven. I'm on the phone

196
00:16:18,180 --> 00:16:22,060
This is an important call. Yeah, I told now it's even worse

197
00:16:22,860 --> 00:16:26,220
Listen, don't approach too soon cuz you might get scratched but don't wait too long

198
00:16:27,220 --> 00:16:31,420
To apologize because cats definitely will think about that stuff

199
00:16:31,900 --> 00:16:36,900
You can approach a frightened cat but do so with caution. I'm I'm not busy right now

200
00:16:36,900 --> 00:16:38,820
But I'm fucking terrified

201
00:16:38,820 --> 00:16:43,020
It's okay. I'm sorry. I was just listening to creepypasta. I don't have time

202
00:16:43,020 --> 00:16:46,740
I'm listening to creepypasta on the internet Steven, please

203
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:51,980
Walk slowly to the cat. Don't rush up on it. Sorry. Sorry. Sorry. Sorry. Sorry. Don't do that

204
00:16:51,980 --> 00:16:57,660
Don't do that soft gentle talk to your cat. Tell her I'm sorry. You may even use your cat's name

205
00:16:57,660 --> 00:17:04,340
It will not understand either of those things I bet but try blinking slowly cuz cats love that shit

206
00:17:04,340 --> 00:17:09,340
Jackson galaxy Jackson slowly be be clear slow as you can

207
00:17:09,700 --> 00:17:16,740
Slow as you can Jackson galaxy taught that to the world back in like 2007 and every it's the only thing people remember about cats

208
00:17:17,580 --> 00:17:20,180
Stroke your cat gently in her favorite spots

209
00:17:20,580 --> 00:17:25,660
My cat's fucking terrified and I ran up on it real fast, but I know exactly where I touched this little guy

210
00:17:25,660 --> 00:17:29,260
So it's okay scratch behind the ear behind the cheek. It's all good

211
00:17:29,260 --> 00:17:35,140
Play with the cat. These are all good things. Give the cat some attention praise and compliment your cat

212
00:17:35,420 --> 00:17:38,700
Give your cat what he or she wants within reason

213
00:17:39,940 --> 00:17:43,020
Okay into something. Yeah, my car

214
00:17:43,700 --> 00:17:51,540
My cat fucking hates the way I talked about it's stinky, but but I am gonna give it a hundred thousand dollars

215
00:17:51,540 --> 00:17:55,580
I am gonna give it one night where it rules the house

216
00:17:55,580 --> 00:17:59,300
It eats food in the kitchen and I have to shit in its bad box

217
00:18:01,660 --> 00:18:07,240
Here's one thing I know about cats is that levels are very important so I cat trees are a thing

218
00:18:07,340 --> 00:18:10,700
Yeah, so it's a way of cast to show like they're more important than other cash

219
00:18:10,700 --> 00:18:16,980
So when you're apologizing your cat lay down flat on your belly with your arms of your side and kind of inch forward a little

220
00:18:16,980 --> 00:18:19,880
Bit yeah cat knows that you're putting it above you

221
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:26,360
So then we have four entire sort of paragraphs here where the wiki how article artists was like J

222
00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:32,200
Jonah Jameson was like I need fucking I need 18 column inches and they're like, oh shit

223
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:36,880
Well, here's four tips that are all variations on give your cat a treat

224
00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:41,960
Give a treat to your cat leave a cat treat surprise for your cat add treats to your cat's food

225
00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:46,540
Treat your cat with some special food. Good. Good. Good. Now, hold on. I want to go back to number two

226
00:18:46,540 --> 00:18:53,180
Yeah, the problem is if you leave a surprise treat somewhere, it might not associate that treat with you. No, awesome

227
00:18:53,180 --> 00:18:55,380
I'm having a shit day. Steven's been a real jack-off

228
00:18:55,780 --> 00:19:02,580
Tried to run up on me blinked too fast. What's this talked about my butthole talked about my asshole didn't even apologize. What's this?

229
00:19:02,580 --> 00:19:09,160
What's this? What's this a special surprise unrelated to Steven offer some dried catnip. Okay

230
00:19:09,540 --> 00:19:13,620
Hey, yes, I'm not man enough to apologize to my sweet. Mr

231
00:19:13,620 --> 00:19:20,860
Chiskers, but I won't get him fucking fucked up and then maybe when he's in that state he will be more amenable to apologize

232
00:19:20,860 --> 00:19:25,140
Yeah, what'd you do Steven? You talked about my asshole. I don't even remember man

233
00:19:26,300 --> 00:19:29,340
You joke at that, but this is the thing humans do to other humans

234
00:19:29,340 --> 00:19:31,620
Like I'm gonna take you out to a drink to apologize

235
00:19:31,620 --> 00:19:36,380
I think humans do to other humans and then y'all watch the tail

236
00:19:36,420 --> 00:19:42,660
Oh my god, if the tail is pointed up with the tip curled to the side that cat's okay to come

237
00:19:42,660 --> 00:19:49,540
I'm poofed up cat the cat's frightened which as we learned earlier in the article not entirely a deal breaker if he's thumping it though

238
00:19:49,700 --> 00:19:52,900
No, no, no walk right away walk. What if his tail?

239
00:19:53,420 --> 00:19:56,380
Makes the perfect shape of a question mark. Yeah

240
00:19:57,300 --> 00:20:00,280
Mmm, that means he's got a puzzle for you. Follow

241
00:20:01,180 --> 00:20:06,540
Follow the cat and don't stop following it until you've reached the puzzle cuz it's somewhere look at the face

242
00:20:06,820 --> 00:20:12,580
That's helpful. Are the whiskers pointed teeth Baird and nose wrinkled. That's the 101 angry cat stuff

243
00:20:12,580 --> 00:20:16,420
So don't do that things angry if anything did that I'm like, that's a problem

244
00:20:16,660 --> 00:20:17,500
Yeah

245
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:22,340
Now I want to hop down to the community Q&A because someone asked is there a quick and easy way to apologize for little things?

246
00:20:22,380 --> 00:20:28,700
Which is fucking awesome. You've read this whole article and you're like, that's too much time. I can't approach a cat slowly

247
00:20:28,700 --> 00:20:31,980
I'm a businessman on the go. I got stocks to trade and houses to close on

248
00:20:31,980 --> 00:20:37,660
I can't I can't walk up on my cat slow and then blink slow. I'm not made of time or money

249
00:20:37,660 --> 00:20:42,980
You can just say sorry cat name in sweet apologetic voice and pet them gently on the spot

250
00:20:42,980 --> 00:20:47,100
They like so sort of a condo. That's the only two points on this list that really matter

251
00:20:47,260 --> 00:20:51,180
Do you think it's just generating like if you're still clicking through?

252
00:20:52,300 --> 00:20:59,260
It'll just keep making question. Hey, there's like an AI that's like generating answers like do another one about treats

253
00:20:59,260 --> 00:21:01,260
Yeah, they're still clicking

254
00:21:01,420 --> 00:21:03,960
I just took my cat to the vet and they had to give him a shot now

255
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:04,900
He's mad at me and scared me

256
00:21:04,900 --> 00:21:11,700
What do I do now you fucking say to the cat like, I'm sorry. I don't want you to fucking get a heart disease. Mr

257
00:21:11,700 --> 00:21:12,700
Chisker's yeah

258
00:21:12,700 --> 00:21:16,180
You can be pissed off at me if you want because I gave you an expensive shot

259
00:21:16,180 --> 00:21:21,860
So you don't die from cats diseases of which mr. Chisker's I will say there are thousands and

260
00:21:22,540 --> 00:21:28,620
Sometimes they sound fucking made up by the vet who's just trying to sell you men. Oh you shots. Yeah. Sorry, mr

261
00:21:28,620 --> 00:21:34,300
Chisker's that I love you so much. I don't want you to fucking die at age five and grateful shit

262
00:21:34,300 --> 00:21:36,540
How does here's a wiki article?

263
00:21:36,540 --> 00:21:41,300
How does my cat apologize to me for being a real shit after I gave it medicine?

264
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:47,420
So it doesn't die from a lung disease of which there are thousands for cats how to make my cat understand responsibility

265
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:52,980
Yeah, you raise it actually pretty good point about vets. I'm kind of worried about that now cuz like think about it

266
00:21:52,980 --> 00:21:57,940
It's the worst. It's kind of like with the other mechanic and he's like you need a new Farberator

267
00:21:57,940 --> 00:22:03,300
Yeah, it's like I don't think I did. I don't trust you. I'm going to drive away now

268
00:22:03,300 --> 00:22:07,300
I'd see what happens and roll the dice and the check-in July comes on in like a week

269
00:22:07,300 --> 00:22:13,380
Yeah, that's right. If that happens with your pet then that's that's no good. You don't like that

270
00:22:13,380 --> 00:22:16,620
That's a good cast don't have a check-in July, you know what I mean?

271
00:22:16,620 --> 00:22:22,020
They just have shoebox and and and so it's like you I don't how do you trust your vet?

272
00:22:22,020 --> 00:22:26,260
Cuz they do don't they understand it way better than you do. This is awesome. You just gotta do whatever they say

273
00:22:26,260 --> 00:22:33,420
We're being honest chances are for a change. My dogs are in cahoots with that vet the dog a little bit

274
00:22:33,420 --> 00:22:35,460
I go in and the vets like oh, yeah

275
00:22:35,460 --> 00:22:42,060
No, he's got a bad case of kibble cough or whatever. That'll be $500 and then he slips my dogs and treats

276
00:22:42,060 --> 00:22:46,500
Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah, your your parakeet is getting its beak wet on this

277
00:22:48,140 --> 00:22:53,900
Involved it's so cool that we can be on the ground floor of this like anti-vax but for animals move

278
00:22:53,900 --> 00:22:57,120
But like it seems like not really. No, it doesn't seem like

279
00:22:59,540 --> 00:23:02,540
Then you have to make it all Griffin gotta get political

280
00:23:03,060 --> 00:23:06,180
God Griffin, it's always getting political. What's next Griffin?

281
00:23:06,180 --> 00:23:08,580
You and the vets are gonna team up to write us

282
00:23:08,700 --> 00:23:13,780
Emails and talk about how kibble coffee is real and it's very bad and it cost $500

283
00:23:15,420 --> 00:23:17,420
Wait, are you involved? No, no

284
00:23:17,900 --> 00:23:21,300
All I goes all the way to the top of big podcast listen

285
00:23:21,300 --> 00:23:26,780
Listen, I know what I just said, but I do and I I love our nation's vets

286
00:23:26,980 --> 00:23:33,860
But but only our nation's vets and let me just say though. It is weird how it's always $500

287
00:23:37,220 --> 00:23:43,900
Special food. Uh-huh. They're like, oh no, he's got double butt worms. That's 500 big ones. That's like shit

288
00:23:43,900 --> 00:23:45,900
I just paid you 500 big ones

289
00:23:45,900 --> 00:23:53,180
Sometimes we get emails and tweets that we don't deserve and I make it very clear to people

290
00:23:53,540 --> 00:23:58,220
It was it's my dad and my therapist and my wife. I said I did not deserve this tweet

291
00:23:59,820 --> 00:24:04,760
No, Justin you did not deserve it. You did not deserve the tweet. You did not deserve the mean email people

292
00:24:04,760 --> 00:24:09,680
You don't you boys don't deserve it. You're trying your best. I feel like this past five minutes

293
00:24:09,680 --> 00:24:14,560
One of those yeah, I get it. It's one of those times when we're gonna get the tweets

294
00:24:14,560 --> 00:24:17,960
So we're gonna get the emails and we're gonna say yeah. Yeah this one

295
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:22,280
This one. Yeah, we were just kind of we knew

296
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:29,760
We knew it we deserve the tweets now and I guess I would say Lord I apologize

297
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:36,720
Maybe we can flip it in the end cuz I don't know that we said anything like

298
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:43,880
Fully like that identifies it when we said that we weren't talking about veterans. So maybe we oh, yeah

299
00:24:43,880 --> 00:24:48,760
Yeah pin it on veterans and say like, yeah, I don't know why veterans always are charging

300
00:24:49,640 --> 00:24:51,640
to fix our pets

301
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:53,060
Okay

302
00:24:53,060 --> 00:24:58,720
Currently I am do you think there's any veterans who went on to be veterinarian? That's gotta be good. That's funny, right?

303
00:24:59,540 --> 00:25:03,580
They probably didn't firm people and then people want to check them out to see if they're any good

304
00:25:03,580 --> 00:25:05,580
So you're vetting the vet vet?

305
00:25:05,580 --> 00:25:07,580
one more

306
00:25:07,900 --> 00:25:13,860
Then and then okay, we're gonna wait and then he's selling his Corvette and you want to check out and see if it's any good

307
00:25:13,860 --> 00:25:15,860
So you're vetting the vet vets vet?

308
00:25:15,860 --> 00:25:19,820
You got there. Thank you. Thank you

309
00:25:21,140 --> 00:25:25,160
And he named a bet middler. So you're vetting the vet vets vet bet

310
00:25:26,620 --> 00:25:31,620
All right, you're vetting the vet vet vets bet you should have stopped at four

311
00:25:31,620 --> 00:25:37,060
There's not a comedy rule. It's when I started cheating. That's when I started cheating to change the letter

312
00:25:37,940 --> 00:25:39,940
Yeah, change the letter

313
00:25:41,020 --> 00:25:45,300
Currently I'm sitting in the stretching area of my gym sounds disorienting

314
00:25:45,300 --> 00:26:05,300
There's no earthly way. Welcome to the stretching area. Why don't you touch the ceiling? Oh you can't, there it goes.

315
00:26:05,300 --> 00:26:07,300
Welcome to taffy town

316
00:26:07,300 --> 00:26:14,820
We've belabored this enough so that even our dullest listeners can get on it now

317
00:26:15,180 --> 00:26:18,140
Get it. I had a cor- this non-joke

318
00:26:18,140 --> 00:26:22,620
I had a quarter in my pocket and I just looked over to see my quarter rolling across the floor

319
00:26:22,900 --> 00:26:27,540
Landing against the stretching mat of the girl closest to me who is like five feet away

320
00:26:28,140 --> 00:26:31,020
My quarter is leaning up against her mat. She hasn't noticed

321
00:26:31,020 --> 00:26:38,260
Brothers, do I cut my losses and leave my quarter or do I ask her for it back and try to explain that my quarter

322
00:26:38,260 --> 00:26:44,300
Rolled out of my pocket to her mat, even though that sounds like an absolute lie. That's from runaway quarter in

323
00:26:44,660 --> 00:26:46,660
Run- run- kunkama

324
00:26:46,900 --> 00:26:50,180
Run- kunkama. I mean, it's not a lie. The quarter's there

325
00:26:51,540 --> 00:26:53,540
Who but?

326
00:26:54,140 --> 00:26:56,140
Did you just I want

327
00:26:56,140 --> 00:27:00,620
Before we get into the specifics of this, I would like to talk about quarters, okay?

328
00:27:01,340 --> 00:27:08,620
Pennies, dimes, nickels, throw them all in the garbage truck. Now a dime, I disagree. Yeah. A dime is so little

329
00:27:08,620 --> 00:27:15,540
It takes up so little effort to pick it up. A quarter. Oh man. Where I'm at in my life right now

330
00:27:16,180 --> 00:27:18,180
You still will come across

331
00:27:18,660 --> 00:27:20,580
like a

332
00:27:20,580 --> 00:27:23,060
Vending machine you want to get yourself some Trident

333
00:27:23,060 --> 00:27:26,540
Yeah, or maybe you want to park a car and you gotta put a quarter in there

334
00:27:26,540 --> 00:27:30,700
Or you have a quarter. You're all still need from time to time and to me

335
00:27:30,700 --> 00:27:35,980
I so rarely use cash that I never even really encounter quarters

336
00:27:36,180 --> 00:27:40,060
So the value of the quarter has actually exceeded

337
00:27:41,020 --> 00:27:47,700
The value of the quarter due to rarity. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes due to rarity. How did I get a quarter?

338
00:27:47,700 --> 00:27:51,700
I can- there have been times in the past like literal month of my adult life

339
00:27:51,700 --> 00:27:56,780
I've been like, ooh two quarters. Yeah, like a little excited in my pocket. What's that jingle-jangle?

340
00:27:56,780 --> 00:28:01,380
I don't ever get these bad boys. Guess daddy's getting some Trident. I'll tell you the mistake I made

341
00:28:01,900 --> 00:28:05,820
About two years ago. Just went to the bank hand him a $10 bill

342
00:28:05,820 --> 00:28:10,140
It said give me a roll of quarters and then I just emptied it into the center console of my car

343
00:28:10,300 --> 00:28:16,740
So I would always have a quarter if I needed it, but then I should put and that's why that high-speed collision was in fact

344
00:28:16,740 --> 00:28:22,020
very bad. Incredibly bad. It was basically a dirty bomb at that point, but

345
00:28:22,020 --> 00:28:26,260
Then I started to take for granted that the quarter would always be there

346
00:28:27,900 --> 00:28:33,500
And then one day I pull up to Aussie and I need to get my Aldi card out by putting a quarter into the cart

347
00:28:34,220 --> 00:28:39,460
No quarter, and I'm the asshole running around with two dimes and a nickel like hey, can I- will anybody trade?

348
00:28:39,460 --> 00:28:42,220
Will you trade? Who will buy trades? Who's doing coin trades?

349
00:28:42,220 --> 00:28:46,020
Who will buy my nickel and dimes?

350
00:28:47,100 --> 00:28:51,460
That's a mistake I made. I emptied out my 401k for- and I got it all in quarters

351
00:28:51,460 --> 00:28:56,900
I went to Dave on Busters, and I was like I'm gonna have the best weekend ever and then they were like we do digital

352
00:28:57,260 --> 00:28:59,260
cards, we don't do points anymore.

353
00:29:00,860 --> 00:29:06,460
Fuck. I'll tell you who fucking loves quarters. Four-year-olds. I hand BB three quarters

354
00:29:06,460 --> 00:29:14,700
She's a kid. No, she's four guys. Like tic-tac. She doesn't eat quarters. That's my 18-year-old.

355
00:29:15,100 --> 00:29:18,260
Great Wolf Lodge Arcade does the digital cards

356
00:29:18,260 --> 00:29:24,980
And I tell you guys when you start hitting the slots really hard trying to get the- you don't really feel that money leaving so much

357
00:29:25,220 --> 00:29:30,180
When it's on a card you're trying to get that like Squidward. Oh, yeah. You need to complete your Spongebob card.

358
00:29:30,180 --> 00:29:34,140
I mean the Gary is the hard to get one. That's the Chase. The Gary's the Chase one for sure.

359
00:29:34,140 --> 00:29:40,140
Just like the Toto in the Wizard of Oz one. That's the Chase. Oh, man. This sucks because she's stretching.

360
00:29:40,140 --> 00:29:46,140
Oh, yeah. So you can't- you can't- let me say this- you can't go over. You can't approach.

361
00:29:46,140 --> 00:29:48,700
So here's the question. Would a sign help?

362
00:29:50,060 --> 00:29:57,860
I mean, damn it. You could still maybe even use the I'm not jerking off out here sign to like walk over and grab the coin and

363
00:29:57,860 --> 00:30:04,900
And that even the presence of that feels like harassment. Yeah, so I think in this circumstance the answer is no.

364
00:30:05,220 --> 00:30:10,940
Yeah, because the amount of effort one would need to put into making a sign to explain that your quarter rolled over there.

365
00:30:10,940 --> 00:30:15,940
That's too much effort. We haven't established the value of quarters though.

366
00:30:15,940 --> 00:30:20,140
This is what I'm struggling with is like, what do you have

367
00:30:20,140 --> 00:30:28,140
later in the day that you needed that quarter for? It's got to be important because you got dressed for the gym and you thought,

368
00:30:28,140 --> 00:30:32,140
well, I'm taking this quarter with me. Gotta put this quarter in my waistband.

369
00:30:32,140 --> 00:30:38,140
The only thing that makes sense is that they found the quarter earlier, in which case, easy come easy go.

370
00:30:38,140 --> 00:30:42,140
You gotta let it go. You gotta let it go. Yeah, now it's on its journey, right? It's continuing on.

371
00:30:42,140 --> 00:30:46,140
You were but a waypoint on this quarter's journey. Yeah.

372
00:30:46,140 --> 00:30:53,140
But if it's your quarter and you have big plans and this is the one gym in the world that sells big bottles of Powerade for a quarter

373
00:30:53,140 --> 00:30:58,140
and you were going to slam that sweet blue stuff after your workout. Yeah, you got to get that quarter back.

374
00:30:58,140 --> 00:31:02,140
And here's the thing. I think that this is, listen, this is not a perfect solution,

375
00:31:02,140 --> 00:31:07,140
but you could quickly walk over, murmur, I dropped my quarter and pick it up and get back.

376
00:31:07,140 --> 00:31:14,140
They will judge you. The person will judge you. But you're in and you're out fast enough that your hope is you're not memorable.

377
00:31:14,140 --> 00:31:23,140
It's not a remarkable incident. Right. But you can't, again, you can't go over there. You can't.

378
00:31:23,140 --> 00:31:27,140
Ah, damn it. I was going to say big magnet, but that doesn't work on quarters, does it? No, no, no.

379
00:31:27,140 --> 00:31:29,140
It doesn't work on quarters. They're probably zinc or something.

380
00:31:29,140 --> 00:31:34,140
You could train an animal to get it for you, but that's kind of a long thing.

381
00:31:34,140 --> 00:31:38,140
You have to just hope that they don't pick up the quarter. Yeah, yeah, yeah. You gotta wait it out.

382
00:31:38,140 --> 00:31:46,140
I see a big, beautiful quarter with no one nearby. Especially just leaning there on my mat calling to me. It's my quarter.

383
00:31:46,140 --> 00:31:50,140
Now here's, you do need to be careful. You need, okay, while they're still stretching on the mat,

384
00:31:50,140 --> 00:31:54,140
you need to forget that quarter exists and keep doing whatever you're doing.

385
00:31:54,140 --> 00:32:01,140
Because if there's even a whiff of you staring over there and checking, they're not going to assume you're looking at a quarter. Right?

386
00:32:01,140 --> 00:32:09,140
It's, I don't, I've never really been a gym guy. Really? What? No.

387
00:32:09,140 --> 00:32:12,140
I don't know. But, Griffin, you're so beefy and strong.

388
00:32:12,140 --> 00:32:17,140
Well, I do it at home with all the big flower bags of flour that I carry around.

389
00:32:17,140 --> 00:32:24,140
Oh, yeah, you do more of the rocky found stuff. No, it's mostly just big bags of flour I got at Costco.

390
00:32:24,140 --> 00:32:36,140
And I don't know what the sort of status quo is vis-a-vis talking to or looking at other people who are exercising.

391
00:32:36,140 --> 00:32:43,140
Because I'll say this, when I exercise in my office, I draw the blinds. I shut the doors.

392
00:32:43,140 --> 00:32:50,140
No one should have to see that, and I don't want anyone to see that, and I don't want to see other people doing it.

393
00:32:50,140 --> 00:33:01,140
And so, I don't, this is unacceptable. I think if you go get the quarter, there's a good chance you may be removed from the premises.

394
00:33:01,140 --> 00:33:08,140
Is there a way that you could play it like, oh, wait, hold on, sorry, real quick, oh, oh, that was close, when you pick up the quarter?

395
00:33:08,140 --> 00:33:12,140
If it's still rolling, if it's, ooh, that's it, you fucked up already.

396
00:33:12,140 --> 00:33:21,140
If you do this instinctively, if the quarter goes, bye, you stretch too hard, bye, and starts to roll away, if you jump at it then,

397
00:33:21,140 --> 00:33:29,140
and like, Grabbitball, it's doing its little like spinny thing, and you like slap your hand down on it, and the other person's so scared,

398
00:33:29,140 --> 00:33:34,140
and you're like, look, and you show them it's a quarter, and they'll be like, oh, glad you got it, that's it.

399
00:33:34,140 --> 00:33:42,140
Also, because your body will naturally make a noise that's like, whoa, when you get it, that'll make it clear like, yeah,

400
00:33:42,140 --> 00:33:49,140
I'm not trying to connect with you or impress you in any way, this is 100% about the quarter, because if it were not,

401
00:33:49,140 --> 00:33:53,140
my body would not have made that noise in front of you, another human being.

402
00:33:53,140 --> 00:33:57,140
What about, hey, you dropped your quarter.

403
00:33:57,140 --> 00:34:04,140
And if they say, that's not my quarter, you say, congratulations, you've passed.

404
00:34:04,140 --> 00:34:06,140
But what if they say, that is my quarter?

405
00:34:06,140 --> 00:34:14,140
Then you know something terrible about that, and you can fucking, there is no link that person will not go to to cover up the fact that they just lied to you.

406
00:34:14,140 --> 00:34:16,140
Yeah, it's time to ruin their life, you know what I mean?

407
00:34:16,140 --> 00:34:18,140
Yeah, it's time to ruin them.

408
00:34:18,140 --> 00:34:20,140
Do an announcement on the gym announcer.

409
00:34:20,140 --> 00:34:24,140
Hey, everyone, we have a real singer.

410
00:34:24,140 --> 00:34:26,140
Everybody join me.

411
00:34:26,140 --> 00:34:29,140
Don't drop a quarter near Laura.

412
00:34:29,140 --> 00:34:33,140
Announcement, don't drop a quarter near Laura, she'll just gobble it right up like Batman.

413
00:34:33,140 --> 00:34:36,140
Also, could someone spot me for a Powerade after my workout?

414
00:34:36,140 --> 00:34:37,140
I'm so fucking thirsty.

415
00:34:37,140 --> 00:34:39,140
Yes, also, I need a quarter.

416
00:34:39,140 --> 00:34:41,140
Shit.

417
00:34:41,140 --> 00:34:48,140
You also look over and say, penny for your thoughts, and they'll say, that is a quarter, and then you run away.

418
00:34:48,140 --> 00:34:50,140
You run away laughing.

419
00:34:50,140 --> 00:34:53,140
Let's take a break and go to the Mayzone.

420
00:34:53,140 --> 00:35:03,140
I'll tell you guys, there's two things I love.

421
00:35:03,140 --> 00:35:05,140
Wait, I want to do it.

422
00:35:05,140 --> 00:35:07,140
I want to do it.

423
00:35:07,140 --> 00:35:11,140
Welcome to my perfect sight.

424
00:35:11,140 --> 00:35:13,140
Hey, everybody, it's Justin McElroy.

425
00:35:13,140 --> 00:35:19,140
Welcome to my talk show, My Perfect Sight, where we talk about my incredible 2020 vision.

426
00:35:19,140 --> 00:35:24,140
We talk to a guest who wants to get my abilities through artificial augmentation.

427
00:35:24,140 --> 00:35:33,140
Today, we have a pair of podcasting brothers, Travis and Griffin McElroy, and they want to get a little bit of my perfect sight.

428
00:35:33,140 --> 00:35:38,140
Boys, what are you trying to get this incredible 2020 vision that you crave?

429
00:35:38,140 --> 00:35:40,140
It's pronounced McLeoroy, please.

430
00:35:40,140 --> 00:35:42,140
McLeoroy, my mistake.

431
00:35:42,140 --> 00:35:44,140
We go to Warby Parker.

432
00:35:44,140 --> 00:35:50,140
They have affordable glasses, including prescription lenses, sunglasses, progressives.

433
00:35:50,140 --> 00:35:53,140
They're a very progressive company.

434
00:35:53,140 --> 00:35:58,140
They have blue light lenses, and this show feels weird.

435
00:35:58,140 --> 00:36:00,140
I don't know that I love this show.

436
00:36:00,140 --> 00:36:01,140
Yeah, it feels very judgmental.

437
00:36:01,140 --> 00:36:03,140
What's the aesthetic?

438
00:36:03,140 --> 00:36:04,140
I mean, it's cool.

439
00:36:04,140 --> 00:36:06,140
It's vintage inspired with a contemporary twist.

440
00:36:06,140 --> 00:36:11,140
I mean, every pair is custom fit with really cool lenses and shit.

441
00:36:11,140 --> 00:36:13,140
I own a lot of Warby Parker already.

442
00:36:13,140 --> 00:36:20,140
When I wear glasses, it makes me feel kind of like a cyborg because I'm enhancing my vision through artificial means.

443
00:36:20,140 --> 00:36:22,140
Now, boys, I have a question.

444
00:36:22,140 --> 00:36:24,140
The glasses sound beautiful.

445
00:36:24,140 --> 00:36:30,140
I'm looking at you two, and you look great, and the deals sound great.

446
00:36:30,140 --> 00:36:37,140
My big question for you, and I think a lot of our home audience is wondering this as well, why not just look at things with your perfect eyes?

447
00:36:37,140 --> 00:36:45,140
Yeah, we took a quiz. You take a quiz, but a fun one, not like a school one, and then they send you a home try-on kit with a bunch of-

448
00:36:45,140 --> 00:36:46,140
How do you see it?

449
00:36:46,140 --> 00:36:47,140
Oh, boy.

450
00:36:47,140 --> 00:36:51,140
With my glasses that I'm wearing, and you get it-

451
00:36:51,140 --> 00:36:56,140
Your bad, shameful glasses that you're trying to replace.

452
00:36:56,140 --> 00:37:06,140
You try them on. They send five different frames, and you try them on, and you see what looks good, and you pick them, and later they send you the glasses, and it looks good on your face.

453
00:37:06,140 --> 00:37:20,140
And it's very important for people like Griffin and I who have very large heads, and things that fit normal human beings don't always fit us, so we use the home try-on kits just to make sure it doesn't look like a novelty thing.

454
00:37:20,140 --> 00:37:23,140
This is one thing I can actually sympathize with you.

455
00:37:23,140 --> 00:37:30,140
If we are us, and you ever lose or break your sunglasses, and people are like, just go get another pair over there. They've got a whole rack of them.

456
00:37:30,140 --> 00:37:31,140
Nope.

457
00:37:31,140 --> 00:37:34,140
No. We need a special store for us.

458
00:37:34,140 --> 00:37:42,140
If they look like the anime character where they draw them with really tiny circle glasses on their giant head, that's us in real life.

459
00:37:42,140 --> 00:37:45,140
Regular glasses look like Mr. Potato Head glasses on us.

460
00:37:45,140 --> 00:37:46,140
Yes.

461
00:37:46,140 --> 00:37:47,140
This got real personal.

462
00:37:47,140 --> 00:37:48,140
It did.

463
00:37:48,140 --> 00:37:56,140
And also, Justin brings up a great point where that me and Travis have to wear glasses because of our prescription, but Justin wears Gunners for fun.

464
00:37:56,140 --> 00:37:57,140
I call them funners.

465
00:37:57,140 --> 00:38:05,140
You can try on Warby Parker for free with the home try-on program. You order five pairs of glasses to try on at home for free for five days, and there's no obligation to buy.

466
00:38:05,140 --> 00:38:08,140

467
00:38:08,140 --> 00:38:14,140
Try five pairs of glasses at home for free at warbyparker.com slash my brother.

468
00:38:14,140 --> 00:38:17,140
Welcome to My Perfect Stamps!

469
00:38:17,140 --> 00:38:22,140
This is the show where Griffin and I have perfect stamps because we use stamps.com.

470
00:38:22,140 --> 00:38:23,140
Justin's got dirty stamps.

471
00:38:23,140 --> 00:38:24,140
Justin's got dirty stamps.

472
00:38:24,140 --> 00:38:27,140
Justin buys used stamps.

473
00:38:27,140 --> 00:38:29,140
He buys used old stamps, and he puts them in a book.

474
00:38:29,140 --> 00:38:32,140
He doesn't even use them to send letters or anything.

475
00:38:32,140 --> 00:38:38,140
He just gets them, and then he looks at them, and he's still going to the post office wasting that time like a real goober.

476
00:38:38,140 --> 00:38:39,140
I don't get it.

477
00:38:39,140 --> 00:38:41,140
You know what I heard, Griffin?

478
00:38:41,140 --> 00:38:42,140
What did you hear?

479
00:38:42,140 --> 00:38:44,140
He doesn't have anything better to do except go to the post office.

480
00:38:44,140 --> 00:38:45,140
For sure, for sure.

481
00:38:45,140 --> 00:38:47,140
And he doesn't like saving on postage.

482
00:38:47,140 --> 00:38:56,140
He likes wasting his money on old, dirty stamps that people have already licked or postage that comes from the post office, and he doesn't want to spend time with his family.

483
00:38:56,140 --> 00:38:59,140
That's the worst part for me, if you ask me.

484
00:38:59,140 --> 00:39:06,140
That's the worst part for me is he says, going to the post office gives me an excuse to not have to see the smiling faces of my children.

485
00:39:06,140 --> 00:39:09,140
And he said, my only friends are at the post office.

486
00:39:09,140 --> 00:39:11,140
And I was like, that's fucked up.

487
00:39:11,140 --> 00:39:17,140
Every day I go and buy more stamps just so I can see Postman Steve's smiling face because I like it more than my own children.

488
00:39:17,140 --> 00:39:21,140
It's weird because Postman Steve doesn't know who Justin is.

489
00:39:21,140 --> 00:39:23,140
No, but Justin is giving him gifts.

490
00:39:23,140 --> 00:39:26,140
He gives him gifts every time he goes to see him.

491
00:39:26,140 --> 00:39:27,140
I've been keeping Italian.

492
00:39:27,140 --> 00:39:33,140
So far, you guys are up to three 100% accurate statements that you have made, and I'd really like to hear one.

493
00:39:33,140 --> 00:39:37,140
Stamps.com brings the same U.S. Postal and UPS shipping services right to your computer.

494
00:39:37,140 --> 00:39:43,140
They print official U.S. postage and shipping labels while you print them 24-7 without having to leave your desk or buy any fancy equipment.

495
00:39:43,140 --> 00:39:52,140
All you need is your computer and a standard printer, and they offer deals you can't get anywhere else, like 40% off USPS and up to 66% off UPS shipping rates.

496
00:39:52,140 --> 00:39:59,140
And if you have really good peripheral vision, you can click and print those stamps while staring at your children's smiling faces

497
00:39:59,140 --> 00:40:11,140
or your cats or your dogs or house plants or a puzzle you completed and then lacquer it and put it up on the wall, whatever you want to look at that you like more than going outside, which I totally get, you can do that.

498
00:40:11,140 --> 00:40:17,140
So don't waste any more time looking at your kids, and don't go to the post office.

499
00:40:17,140 --> 00:40:18,140
Go to Stamps.com instead.

505
00:40:39,140 --> 00:40:41,140
Hello, I'm Riley Smyrl.

506
00:40:41,140 --> 00:40:42,140
I'm Sydney McElroy.

507
00:40:42,140 --> 00:40:44,140
And I'm Taylor Smyrl.

508
00:40:44,140 --> 00:40:48,140
And we host Still Buffering, a cross-generational guide to the culture that made us.

509
00:40:48,140 --> 00:40:55,140
Every week, we share media that made us who we are, things like Archie Comics, Sailor Moon.

510
00:40:55,140 --> 00:40:57,140
And lots of Taylor Swift.

511
00:40:57,140 --> 00:41:01,140
And now that Riley's an adult, it comes with 100% more butts.

512
00:41:01,140 --> 00:41:04,140
And now I am totally comfortable with it.

513
00:41:04,140 --> 00:41:10,140
So check out new episodes of Still Buffering every Thursday on MaximumFun.org.

514
00:41:11,140 --> 00:41:12,140
Butts, butts, butts. Join in, Riley.

515
00:41:12,140 --> 00:41:15,140
Butts, butts, butts.

516
00:41:23,140 --> 00:41:25,140
D-d-d-d-d-d-d-evolution.

517
00:41:25,140 --> 00:41:25,980
What?

518
00:41:26,980 --> 00:41:27,820
Step two.

519
00:41:31,820 --> 00:41:33,000
Evolved.

520
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:35,000
I want to munch, too.

521
00:41:37,140 --> 00:41:38,940
I want to munch.

522
00:41:38,940 --> 00:41:39,780
Squat four.

523
00:41:44,380 --> 00:41:46,300
Welcome to Munch Squad Evolved.

524
00:41:46,300 --> 00:41:48,200
This is an evolution of Munch Squad

525
00:41:48,200 --> 00:41:50,020
in a podcast within a podcast.

526
00:41:50,020 --> 00:41:52,240
We're a profile of the latest and greatest in brand eating.

527
00:41:52,240 --> 00:41:57,240
I cannot, I can no longer rely on the quick service

528
00:41:57,860 --> 00:41:59,700
restaurants and their press departments

529
00:41:59,700 --> 00:42:02,240
to give me what I crave.

530
00:42:02,240 --> 00:42:06,560
So I've decided to help Munch Squad along a little bit

531
00:42:06,560 --> 00:42:09,640
with the evolve, sort of a, this is called,

532
00:42:09,640 --> 00:42:11,120
I call it people's choice.

533
00:42:11,120 --> 00:42:12,780
This is Munch Squad people's choice.

534
00:42:12,780 --> 00:42:14,040
And here's the deal.

535
00:42:18,220 --> 00:42:22,100
Okay, so welcome to Munch Squad Evolved, people's choice.

536
00:42:22,100 --> 00:42:24,260
This is where I, here's the thing.

537
00:42:24,260 --> 00:42:27,540
I am a member of several different groups on Facebook

538
00:42:27,540 --> 00:42:30,500
devoted to restaurants in my area.

539
00:42:30,500 --> 00:42:31,700
Really?

540
00:42:31,700 --> 00:42:33,780
And I wanted to see what the people are saying.

541
00:42:33,780 --> 00:42:34,820
You know what I mean?

542
00:42:34,820 --> 00:42:36,860
Because you can listen to the press releases

543
00:42:36,860 --> 00:42:38,740
and what they say about the restaurants,

544
00:42:38,740 --> 00:42:41,860
but what are the people saying about the restaurants?

545
00:42:41,860 --> 00:42:42,700
That's what I'm gonna do.

546
00:42:42,700 --> 00:42:44,100
Okay, okay.

547
00:42:44,100 --> 00:42:45,940
Okay, so this is, I'm not even gonna say

548
00:42:45,940 --> 00:42:47,260
what groups they're from because honestly,

549
00:42:47,260 --> 00:42:48,800
I don't want people to join them

550
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:50,100
and make things weird for everybody.

551
00:42:50,100 --> 00:42:52,700
Cause this is just for kind of like us West Virginians

552
00:42:52,700 --> 00:42:55,700
to get in there and dish on the dishes,

553
00:42:55,700 --> 00:42:57,660
as we say in the groups.

554
00:42:59,340 --> 00:43:00,780
But mainly it's reviews.

555
00:43:00,780 --> 00:43:02,020
That's what people like to leave.

556
00:43:02,020 --> 00:43:05,620
So you can kind of get a sense of the good Taco Bell.

557
00:43:05,620 --> 00:43:06,440
You know what I mean?

558
00:43:06,440 --> 00:43:07,280
Yeah. Okay.

559
00:43:08,380 --> 00:43:10,740
I hadn't been to Steak Escape in Kanawha City

560
00:43:10,740 --> 00:43:13,780
for quite a while and thought I would drive through

561
00:43:13,780 --> 00:43:15,260
and bring it home for dinner.

562
00:43:15,260 --> 00:43:18,780
So this, what this person's provided is a justification

563
00:43:18,780 --> 00:43:20,900
for why they have decided to go to a restaurant

564
00:43:20,900 --> 00:43:21,980
and purchase food.

565
00:43:21,980 --> 00:43:23,100
It's so important.

566
00:43:23,100 --> 00:43:24,900
Cause a lot of restaurant reviews will leave out

567
00:43:24,900 --> 00:43:27,340
the fact that they wanted to buy food.

568
00:43:27,340 --> 00:43:28,700
While I was waiting in line,

569
00:43:28,700 --> 00:43:32,260
I saw a guy in front of M&M Mart sitting on the curb

570
00:43:32,260 --> 00:43:34,460
and shouting out to people who ignored him.

571
00:43:35,700 --> 00:43:39,380
Seemed to be under some kind of influence.

572
00:43:39,380 --> 00:43:41,900
Suddenly he was knocking on my window

573
00:43:41,900 --> 00:43:46,060
and told me that the food at this Steak Escape was bad.

574
00:43:46,060 --> 00:43:47,620
Oh no.

575
00:43:47,620 --> 00:43:49,260
And he said the last time he ate there,

576
00:43:49,260 --> 00:43:50,700
he was sick for a week.

577
00:43:50,700 --> 00:43:52,100
So, okay.

578
00:43:52,100 --> 00:43:54,980
Let me tell you what this person has just described

579
00:43:54,980 --> 00:43:57,100
is a situation where they go to Steak Escape,

580
00:43:57,100 --> 00:44:00,420
they see someone yelling at people who won't believe them.

581
00:44:00,420 --> 00:44:01,540
They're ignoring them.

582
00:44:01,540 --> 00:44:03,260
And then they run and say,

583
00:44:03,260 --> 00:44:05,780
don't eat at the Steak Escape.

584
00:44:05,780 --> 00:44:07,740
It's bad.

585
00:44:07,740 --> 00:44:09,980
It's very relevant to this person's life.

586
00:44:09,980 --> 00:44:12,380
What's wonderful about this is it's a real world

587
00:44:12,380 --> 00:44:16,380
like example of why if somebody busted into

588
00:44:16,380 --> 00:44:17,580
wherever you are right now and said,

589
00:44:17,580 --> 00:44:19,260
I'm you from the future,

590
00:44:19,260 --> 00:44:20,580
don't do what you're about to do.

591
00:44:20,580 --> 00:44:22,340
You'd be like, okay, whatever.

592
00:44:22,340 --> 00:44:23,820
They're under the influence of something.

593
00:44:23,820 --> 00:44:26,620
This person is doing the Lord's work

594
00:44:26,620 --> 00:44:28,620
trying to keep you from getting butt sick

595
00:44:28,620 --> 00:44:29,940
at Steak Escape.

596
00:44:29,940 --> 00:44:32,260
I don't know how to catch people before they go in.

597
00:44:32,260 --> 00:44:34,540
So I'm just waiting outside to tell people

598
00:44:34,540 --> 00:44:36,700
that it's like, don't eat at this one, okay?

599
00:44:36,700 --> 00:44:38,540
It made me really sick.

600
00:44:38,540 --> 00:44:40,180
I appreciate that.

601
00:44:40,180 --> 00:44:43,280
Yeah, except this person, this review writer says,

602
00:44:43,280 --> 00:44:45,460
I thought he was just a little nutty

603
00:44:45,460 --> 00:44:48,320
and continue to pay for my food and take it home.

604
00:44:49,500 --> 00:44:51,900
I continue to pay for my food and take it home.

605
00:44:51,900 --> 00:44:53,380
I had COVID in January

606
00:44:53,380 --> 00:44:55,900
and smell and taste are still not quite back.

607
00:44:56,860 --> 00:44:59,100
At home, I opened the sandwich wrapper

608
00:44:59,100 --> 00:45:01,780
and my Grand Escape looked fine.

609
00:45:01,780 --> 00:45:02,620
I took a bite.

610
00:45:02,620 --> 00:45:05,180
And as I did, I got a whiff of the sandwich.

611
00:45:05,180 --> 00:45:06,900
Whoa, that's the order that it took.

612
00:45:06,900 --> 00:45:07,740
I guess.

613
00:45:09,060 --> 00:45:12,460
There's like 20 comments on this review

614
00:45:12,460 --> 00:45:16,140
where people are like, please explain to me the mechanics of,

615
00:45:16,140 --> 00:45:18,940
I bit the sandwich and then later on I smell.

616
00:45:18,940 --> 00:45:22,220
Well, Justin, taste and smell were very clear.

617
00:45:22,220 --> 00:45:24,220
Not quite back, right?

618
00:45:24,220 --> 00:45:27,380
I took a bite and as I did, I got a whiff of the sandwich.

619
00:45:27,380 --> 00:45:29,900
I smelled it and then asked my granddaughter

620
00:45:29,900 --> 00:45:31,940
to see if it smelled okay to her.

621
00:45:31,940 --> 00:45:33,460
Hey, come here.

622
00:45:33,460 --> 00:45:35,140
Get over here.

623
00:45:35,140 --> 00:45:39,140
Hey, get over here and smell mama's stinky sandwich.

624
00:45:39,140 --> 00:45:39,960
Oh yeah, that's-

625
00:45:39,960 --> 00:45:40,980
Hey, me must-

626
00:45:40,980 --> 00:45:42,780
That smells fucking rancid, grandma.

627
00:45:42,780 --> 00:45:43,740
You should not eat that.

628
00:45:43,740 --> 00:45:44,940
I already did.

629
00:45:44,940 --> 00:45:45,780
Fuck.

630
00:45:46,780 --> 00:45:49,380
If only I could have smelled it before I ate it.

631
00:45:49,380 --> 00:45:50,460
Damn it.

632
00:45:50,460 --> 00:45:51,300
Ugh.

633
00:45:51,300 --> 00:45:52,180
It tastes fine.

634
00:45:52,180 --> 00:45:55,220
I smelled it and then asked my granddaughter

635
00:45:55,220 --> 00:45:56,700
to see if it smelled okay to her.

636
00:45:56,700 --> 00:46:00,060
It says in parentheses, she knew nothing about the guy.

637
00:46:00,060 --> 00:46:00,900
That's important.

638
00:46:00,900 --> 00:46:01,740
That is important.

639
00:46:01,740 --> 00:46:02,580
I was gonna ask.

640
00:46:02,580 --> 00:46:03,420
I'm so glad that you said that.

641
00:46:03,420 --> 00:46:04,340
She's not biased.

642
00:46:04,340 --> 00:46:05,340
Yes.

643
00:46:05,340 --> 00:46:07,100
Although I don't know how cool your life is.

644
00:46:07,100 --> 00:46:09,940
If that happened to me, as soon as I walked in the door,

645
00:46:09,940 --> 00:46:11,500
I would be telling my wife this incredible story.

646
00:46:11,500 --> 00:46:12,740
I met an angel today.

647
00:46:12,740 --> 00:46:13,580
Yeah.

648
00:46:13,580 --> 00:46:15,820
Except you're the villain in that story, aren't you?

649
00:46:15,820 --> 00:46:17,180
Because someone was waiting outside

650
00:46:17,180 --> 00:46:18,100
to tell you don't eat here.

651
00:46:18,100 --> 00:46:18,940
Well, that's the thing.

652
00:46:18,940 --> 00:46:19,780
And then you still did.

653
00:46:19,780 --> 00:46:20,620
And if you went home,

654
00:46:20,620 --> 00:46:22,940
and I'm not just saying this specifically about Sydney,

655
00:46:22,940 --> 00:46:24,860
but if you went home and told your wife this story,

656
00:46:24,860 --> 00:46:26,380
and whoever you're telling this story to

657
00:46:26,380 --> 00:46:28,380
was not there to see it,

658
00:46:28,380 --> 00:46:31,660
their first thing is going to be, and you still did it?

659
00:46:31,660 --> 00:46:32,860
Like, because-

660
00:46:32,860 --> 00:46:33,700
Yeah, it's impossible.

661
00:46:33,700 --> 00:46:37,460
That's how I feel, person writing this comment.

662
00:46:37,460 --> 00:46:39,460
I smelled it and then asked my granddaughter

663
00:46:39,460 --> 00:46:40,500
to see if it smelled okay to her.

664
00:46:40,500 --> 00:46:42,140
She knew nothing about the guy.

665
00:46:42,140 --> 00:46:44,140
She said, it smells like poop.

666
00:46:44,140 --> 00:46:48,180
Well, that's exactly what I thought when I smelled it.

667
00:46:48,180 --> 00:46:51,260
Or in other words, bad meat.

668
00:46:51,260 --> 00:46:52,100
Damn it.

669
00:46:52,100 --> 00:46:54,460
The guy wasn't crazy after all.

670
00:46:54,460 --> 00:46:55,300
No.

671
00:46:55,300 --> 00:46:56,500
It was bad.

672
00:46:56,500 --> 00:46:59,660
I think this is a great example of a sign would have helped.

673
00:46:59,660 --> 00:47:00,500
Yeah.

674
00:47:00,500 --> 00:47:04,700
Because if that gentleman had had a well-constructed sign

675
00:47:04,700 --> 00:47:06,460
that he had clearly spent some time working on-

676
00:47:06,460 --> 00:47:07,740
An official looking sign.

677
00:47:07,740 --> 00:47:08,580
Thank you.

678
00:47:08,580 --> 00:47:10,340
And it was framed, right?

679
00:47:10,340 --> 00:47:11,700
Then you see that and you're like,

680
00:47:11,700 --> 00:47:14,220
well, this isn't a spur of the moment thing.

681
00:47:14,220 --> 00:47:15,740
This is clearly a real issue

682
00:47:15,740 --> 00:47:18,180
that this person is concerned about.

683
00:47:18,180 --> 00:47:20,780
Now, here's the problem though.

684
00:47:20,780 --> 00:47:24,660
If this person had decided to solve this problem

685
00:47:24,660 --> 00:47:25,540
with a sign-

686
00:47:25,540 --> 00:47:26,380
Yes.

687
00:47:27,900 --> 00:47:30,540
Then it starts to raise the issue of,

688
00:47:30,540 --> 00:47:32,620
if the sign's too good,

689
00:47:33,900 --> 00:47:35,940
at what point are you like,

690
00:47:35,940 --> 00:47:37,900
I don't actually need to be a part of this equation?

691
00:47:37,900 --> 00:47:38,740
Yeah.

692
00:47:38,740 --> 00:47:39,580
And that bums you out

693
00:47:39,580 --> 00:47:42,620
because it's like, that's what I was planning on doing today.

694
00:47:42,620 --> 00:47:43,980
But instead I've made,

695
00:47:43,980 --> 00:47:48,020
it's like a John Henry situation where I've made myself-

696
00:47:48,020 --> 00:47:50,540
You could just put the sign there.

697
00:47:50,540 --> 00:47:52,540
Just put the sign there, right?

698
00:47:52,540 --> 00:47:54,540
And you don't need to even be there.

699
00:47:54,540 --> 00:47:55,380
And that's a-

700
00:47:55,380 --> 00:47:57,860
But then the chance of someone being sent out

701
00:47:57,860 --> 00:48:01,100
of that weird side door that all fast food places have

702
00:48:01,100 --> 00:48:02,860
to remove the sign-

703
00:48:02,860 --> 00:48:06,940
Yeah, you need a defender as a steward there.

704
00:48:06,940 --> 00:48:08,140
I mean, if the sign is too good,

705
00:48:08,140 --> 00:48:09,260
you could just start to think

706
00:48:09,260 --> 00:48:11,740
that it is sort of corporate warfare,

707
00:48:11,740 --> 00:48:13,820
like somebody from Beef Journey,

708
00:48:13,820 --> 00:48:17,060
like trying to divert-

709
00:48:17,060 --> 00:48:18,540
Sorry, Beef Journey?

710
00:48:18,540 --> 00:48:21,140
Yeah, that's the main competitor for Steak Escape.

711
00:48:21,140 --> 00:48:21,980
Oh, okay, got it, got it, got it.

712
00:48:21,980 --> 00:48:23,900
I'm looking at the Steak Escape menu.

713
00:48:23,900 --> 00:48:25,660
I've eaten at this restaurant before.

714
00:48:25,660 --> 00:48:28,300
We used to stop off there on our way to church

715
00:48:28,300 --> 00:48:30,100
and get a big sandwich on the way there

716
00:48:30,100 --> 00:48:32,500
to help us get lots of calories, praise the Lord.

717
00:48:32,500 --> 00:48:37,380
And I don't remember them completely fucking

718
00:48:37,380 --> 00:48:39,140
going over the deep end,

719
00:48:39,140 --> 00:48:44,140
but they have so many different fry disasters.

720
00:48:44,820 --> 00:48:48,220
They have an item called Feisty Amigo Fries.

721
00:48:48,220 --> 00:48:49,820
Huh, I don't think that's right.

722
00:48:49,820 --> 00:48:51,340
It's called Feisty Amigo Fries,

723
00:48:51,340 --> 00:48:53,340
and it's got grilled steak, jalapenos, cheddar cheese,

724
00:48:53,340 --> 00:48:56,340
and Mexican seasoning, and pico de gallo,

725
00:48:56,340 --> 00:48:58,140
and pico de gallo, and sour cream,

726
00:48:58,140 --> 00:49:00,300
and somewhere in there is fries.

727
00:49:00,300 --> 00:49:02,740
Somewhere in there's fries, I bet.

728
00:49:02,740 --> 00:49:04,660
You can't just take the contents

729
00:49:04,660 --> 00:49:07,980
of an entirely different dish and put it on fries

730
00:49:07,980 --> 00:49:09,500
and say, is this anything?

731
00:49:09,500 --> 00:49:12,140
Yeah, oh boy, they also have something called

732
00:49:12,140 --> 00:49:13,500
a Teriyaki Crunch Bowl.

733
00:49:13,500 --> 00:49:14,820
I bet that's good.

734
00:49:14,820 --> 00:49:15,660
Also-

735
00:49:15,660 --> 00:49:16,500
I bet that's really good.

736
00:49:16,500 --> 00:49:18,460
Hey, everybody trying to make that fry kind of thing a thing?

737
00:49:18,460 --> 00:49:19,820
That's what nachos are for.

738
00:49:19,820 --> 00:49:22,380
They're firm, you can lift up the whole thing.

739
00:49:22,380 --> 00:49:25,620
A fry is a soggy boy, you can't pick up the whole thing.

740
00:49:25,620 --> 00:49:28,060
Let's keep it, poutine for fries, right?

741
00:49:28,060 --> 00:49:29,100
I'm fine with that.

742
00:49:29,100 --> 00:49:30,900
That's everything else on nachos.

743
00:49:30,900 --> 00:49:31,740
Yeah.

744
00:49:32,620 --> 00:49:34,340
One of the comments on this post,

745
00:49:35,300 --> 00:49:37,940
I got food here like three weeks ago

746
00:49:37,940 --> 00:49:40,240
after waiting in line an hour,

747
00:49:40,240 --> 00:49:42,920
ended up throwing it away, it was horrible.

748
00:49:42,920 --> 00:49:44,980
Billy, did you say an hour?

749
00:49:44,980 --> 00:49:46,220
An hour at Steak Escape?

750
00:49:46,220 --> 00:49:47,940
Hey, Billy, come back.

751
00:49:47,940 --> 00:49:49,220
Are you telling me there was a moment

752
00:49:49,220 --> 00:49:51,420
where you'd been waiting a half hour,

753
00:49:51,420 --> 00:49:54,900
and you were like, I could do this again for Steak Escape?

754
00:49:54,900 --> 00:49:56,980
For Steak Escape, absolutely.

755
00:49:56,980 --> 00:49:58,780
I'm trying to decide now which one's worse

756
00:49:58,780 --> 00:50:00,300
if you were in the drive-through,

757
00:50:00,300 --> 00:50:02,780
or if you were inside in line.

758
00:50:02,780 --> 00:50:04,700
Both are bad. Both are bad.

759
00:50:04,700 --> 00:50:07,620
Damn, they got a sandwich called the Feisty Amigo, too.

760
00:50:07,620 --> 00:50:09,500
It's the same toppings as the french fries.

761
00:50:09,500 --> 00:50:10,340
That's awesome.

762
00:50:10,340 --> 00:50:11,420
You gotta get them together, right?

763
00:50:11,420 --> 00:50:12,760
Those are the amigos.

764
00:50:12,760 --> 00:50:17,280
Yeah, gotta have the clutch that matches the dress.

765
00:50:17,280 --> 00:50:20,460
All the ones around here closed.

766
00:50:20,460 --> 00:50:23,300
The one on Fifth Avenue turned into a restaurant

767
00:50:23,300 --> 00:50:25,220
called Sabatino's, but now it's just Clams.

768
00:50:25,220 --> 00:50:27,700
Oh, I'm sorry, Justin, I just heard from corporate,

769
00:50:27,700 --> 00:50:30,540
the verbiage we're using is they escaped.

770
00:50:30,540 --> 00:50:31,380
They escaped.

771
00:50:32,420 --> 00:50:34,180
Well, the one at the mall transmogrified

772
00:50:34,180 --> 00:50:36,620
into a Charlie's Cheese Steaks, which is fine.

773
00:50:36,620 --> 00:50:37,500
It's an easy twist.

774
00:50:37,500 --> 00:50:38,980
Lateral move.

775
00:50:38,980 --> 00:50:40,420
Worse fries, better chicken tenders.

776
00:50:40,420 --> 00:50:41,740
They can't tell the same employees,

777
00:50:41,740 --> 00:50:44,940
because they already knew their way around the grill.

778
00:50:44,940 --> 00:50:46,600
You remember, as Steak Escape,

779
00:50:46,600 --> 00:50:47,620
there was a big thing there

780
00:50:47,620 --> 00:50:49,980
where they just had a big pile of potatoes,

781
00:50:49,980 --> 00:50:51,300
and then they had the crusher

782
00:50:51,300 --> 00:50:53,380
that would turn them into steak fries.

783
00:50:53,380 --> 00:50:57,500
And you would be like, exciting, chef's table.

784
00:50:57,500 --> 00:50:58,340
And then you're like,

785
00:50:58,340 --> 00:51:02,280
let me get some spicy, zany amigo fries, please.

786
00:51:02,280 --> 00:51:03,340
And they're like, okay.

787
00:51:03,340 --> 00:51:07,020
And you're like, let's see how this sausage gets made.

788
00:51:07,020 --> 00:51:09,200
And then you watch them shove the potato in there,

789
00:51:09,200 --> 00:51:11,880
and then they're like, trying to crush it.

790
00:51:11,880 --> 00:51:15,080
And you're like, fuck, I made them do this,

791
00:51:15,080 --> 00:51:17,060
this hard potato work.

792
00:51:17,060 --> 00:51:19,340
I hate, my name is Daniel.

793
00:51:19,340 --> 00:51:20,500
I work at Steak Escape,

794
00:51:20,500 --> 00:51:22,500
and I hate when people order the fries.

795
00:51:22,500 --> 00:51:27,500
The worst part of my job, when people order the fries.

796
00:51:28,580 --> 00:51:29,420
Definitely.

797
00:51:29,420 --> 00:51:32,660
That's the second worst when they order anything else.

798
00:51:32,660 --> 00:51:33,500
Anything else.

799
00:51:33,500 --> 00:51:35,200
When they bring you the feisty amigo fries

800
00:51:35,200 --> 00:51:37,020
just covered in flop sweat,

801
00:51:37,020 --> 00:51:39,140
and you're like, I'm so fucking,

802
00:51:39,140 --> 00:51:41,900
if I'd have known, no, it's okay.

803
00:51:41,900 --> 00:51:43,620
They make us crush the potatoes.

804
00:51:43,620 --> 00:51:46,120
I don't know why the potatoes aren't pre-crushed.

805
00:51:46,120 --> 00:51:47,340
That's how they do it everywhere else.

806
00:51:47,340 --> 00:51:49,760
It seems like a better way of doing it.

807
00:51:49,760 --> 00:51:50,600
They come sliced everywhere.

808
00:51:50,600 --> 00:51:53,980
Everywhere else, they come sliced, they come crushed.

809
00:51:53,980 --> 00:51:56,100
Potatoes are so firm, fuck.

810
00:51:56,100 --> 00:51:59,340
I also remember Steak Escape had a gigantic container

811
00:51:59,340 --> 00:52:02,220
of seasoned salt out there for your fries.

812
00:52:02,220 --> 00:52:04,380
Because if to say, we don't know what we're doing here.

813
00:52:04,380 --> 00:52:06,180
You have some idea.

814
00:52:06,180 --> 00:52:07,020
We don't know.

815
00:52:07,020 --> 00:52:08,060
Go for it.

816
00:52:08,060 --> 00:52:09,220
What a wild restaurant.

817
00:52:09,220 --> 00:52:12,860
And what a wild podcast it has been today,

818
00:52:12,860 --> 00:52:14,380
here on My Brother, My Brother, Me.

819
00:52:14,380 --> 00:52:15,660
We hope you've enjoyed yourself.

820
00:52:15,660 --> 00:52:18,140
We sure enjoyed spending a little time with you.

821
00:52:18,140 --> 00:52:18,980
Hope your summer's going well.

822
00:52:18,980 --> 00:52:20,460
Oh, yeah.

823
00:52:20,460 --> 00:52:21,580
Yeah, buddy.

824
00:52:21,580 --> 00:52:23,780
I hope you're having a great time out there.

825
00:52:23,780 --> 00:52:25,780
Slippin' and slidin', I assume.

826
00:52:27,460 --> 00:52:29,900
Why are you, oh my God, why are you,

827
00:52:29,900 --> 00:52:32,140
my watch just keeps trying to talk to me.

828
00:52:32,140 --> 00:52:35,220
Justin, I'll be eating Steak Escape today.

829
00:52:35,220 --> 00:52:38,860
Justin, I went ahead and ordered Steak Escape on DoorDash.

830
00:52:38,860 --> 00:52:41,620
Order 500 sandwiches from Steak Escape.

831
00:52:41,620 --> 00:52:43,380
Stop, watch, watch.

832
00:52:44,220 --> 00:52:46,500
Start a tab at Steak Escape.

833
00:52:46,500 --> 00:52:49,420
If you're looking for a way to pass the summertime afternoon

834
00:52:49,420 --> 00:52:52,180
in a very pleasurable fashion, might I suggest

835
00:52:52,180 --> 00:52:56,460
the Adventure Zone Crystal Kingdom, a graphic novel,

836
00:52:56,460 --> 00:52:59,100
which we wrote and Carrie Peach illustrated,

837
00:52:59,100 --> 00:53:00,820
and it is fucking good.

838
00:53:00,820 --> 00:53:01,660
So good.

839
00:53:01,660 --> 00:53:03,340
And it's coming out July 13th.

840
00:53:03,340 --> 00:53:04,620
I'm not just saying that either.

841
00:53:04,620 --> 00:53:05,460
It's a good-

842
00:53:05,460 --> 00:53:07,820
And not just that, not only is it coming out on July 13th,

843
00:53:07,820 --> 00:53:11,080
which is tomorrow, if you're listening to this on Monday,

844
00:53:11,080 --> 00:53:14,340
we are also doing a live and virtual event.

845
00:53:14,340 --> 00:53:16,700
We've got special guests, and trust me when I say

846
00:53:16,700 --> 00:53:17,660
they're very special.

847
00:53:17,660 --> 00:53:19,500
You're going to really enjoy it.

848
00:53:19,500 --> 00:53:20,980
It's an absolute blast.

849
00:53:20,980 --> 00:53:22,580
And you can find out all the information

850
00:53:22,580 --> 00:53:27,580
at bit.ly slash TazGNLive2021.

851
00:53:28,420 --> 00:53:29,340
Get all the info there.

852
00:53:29,340 --> 00:53:31,340
And we have event exclusive signed book plates,

853
00:53:31,340 --> 00:53:33,380
which are available from our partner bookstores.

854
00:53:33,380 --> 00:53:35,500
More info can also be found at that bit link.

855
00:53:35,500 --> 00:53:37,980
And you can submit your pre-order receipt

856
00:53:37,980 --> 00:53:40,700
to get the pre-order gift from First Second, our publisher.

857
00:53:40,700 --> 00:53:43,220
It's a Kravitz lenticular laptop sticker.

858
00:53:43,220 --> 00:53:44,060
I will say this.

859
00:53:44,060 --> 00:53:46,580
If you don't know much about the book publishing world,

860
00:53:46,580 --> 00:53:49,340
here's what I will say to you to keep in mind.

861
00:53:49,340 --> 00:53:51,180
If you like this series,

862
00:53:51,180 --> 00:53:54,300
and you want us to be able to continue to make them,

863
00:53:54,300 --> 00:53:56,740
the thing that most publishers look at,

864
00:53:56,740 --> 00:53:59,500
and kind of the whole publishing world is built this way,

865
00:53:59,500 --> 00:54:03,820
is the first week of book sales.

866
00:54:03,820 --> 00:54:07,180
So if you could buy it the first week,

867
00:54:07,180 --> 00:54:08,540
or pre-order it, that works too.

868
00:54:08,540 --> 00:54:10,620
That would just be the coolest thing you could do.

869
00:54:10,620 --> 00:54:12,220
Yeah, you're so cool.

870
00:54:12,220 --> 00:54:14,460
We got new merch over at mcrorymerch.com,

871
00:54:14,460 --> 00:54:16,940
including a new pin of the month for the Gushy Wolves,

872
00:54:16,940 --> 00:54:20,780
which is a fantastic, just a fantastic joke

873
00:54:20,780 --> 00:54:23,300
from the Ether C Prologue series.

874
00:54:23,300 --> 00:54:25,680
And sales for that benefit the Innocence Project,

875
00:54:25,680 --> 00:54:27,940
which works to exonerate the wrongly convicted

876
00:54:27,940 --> 00:54:31,220
through DNA testing and reforms the criminal justice system

877
00:54:31,220 --> 00:54:33,020
to prevent future injustice.

878
00:54:33,020 --> 00:54:34,060
There's other stuff on there too.

879
00:54:34,060 --> 00:54:36,980
There's an It's Trash sticker from the Bim Bam TV show.

880
00:54:36,980 --> 00:54:38,820
There's a beautiful green stoneware mug

881
00:54:38,820 --> 00:54:40,400
with the Taz logo on it.

882
00:54:40,400 --> 00:54:43,060
There's finally some Besties merch on there.

883
00:54:43,060 --> 00:54:46,660
A t-shirt, if you're one of our many listeners

884
00:54:46,660 --> 00:54:47,500
of the Besties.

885
00:54:47,500 --> 00:54:49,900
So check all that out.

886
00:54:49,900 --> 00:54:51,100
And speaking of Adventure Zone,

887
00:54:51,100 --> 00:54:54,060
the first episode of the new season,

888
00:54:54,060 --> 00:54:56,520
Ether C is out now, we've been doing the prologue,

889
00:54:56,520 --> 00:54:59,580
but now this is the first episode of the regular season.

890
00:54:59,580 --> 00:55:01,300
That's up now.

891
00:55:01,300 --> 00:55:03,020
I do some streaming on Twitch,

892
00:55:03,020 --> 00:55:04,940
twitch.tv slash the Travis Macro,

893
00:55:04,940 --> 00:55:05,900
if you wanna check that out.

894
00:55:05,900 --> 00:55:08,420
We've got a YouTube channel, Macro Family,

895
00:55:08,420 --> 00:55:10,820
a lot of fun stuff on there.

896
00:55:10,820 --> 00:55:13,140
And this is just a personal plug from me to you.

897
00:55:13,140 --> 00:55:14,260
Check out the Besties.

898
00:55:14,260 --> 00:55:15,500
It's one of my favorite podcasts.

899
00:55:15,500 --> 00:55:16,900
I listen every week.

900
00:55:16,900 --> 00:55:19,100
I learn a lot about video games.

901
00:55:19,100 --> 00:55:21,460
It's my brothers, as well as Resh Freshtrick

902
00:55:21,460 --> 00:55:23,000
and Chris Plant.

903
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:24,940
It is one of my favorite podcasts.

904
00:55:24,940 --> 00:55:25,780
Go check it out.

905
00:55:25,780 --> 00:55:26,620
Thanks, Trapp.

906
00:55:26,620 --> 00:55:28,460
And thanks to Montane for the Use for a Theme song.

907
00:55:28,460 --> 00:55:30,580
My life is better with you.

908
00:55:30,580 --> 00:55:32,140
If you follow Montane on Twitter,

909
00:55:32,140 --> 00:55:34,660
you've probably gotten some tips and hints

910
00:55:34,660 --> 00:55:37,020
about some movement.

911
00:55:37,020 --> 00:55:42,020
Let's just say some movement in the music publishing world

912
00:55:42,460 --> 00:55:44,860
vis-a-vis this song and you hearing it

913
00:55:44,860 --> 00:55:46,740
and seeing a music video for it.

914
00:55:46,740 --> 00:55:48,260
So that's all great.

915
00:55:48,260 --> 00:55:49,140
Thank you, Montane.

916
00:55:49,140 --> 00:55:50,780
And thanks Max Fun for having us on the network.

917
00:55:50,780 --> 00:55:51,700
Go to maximumfun.org,

918
00:55:51,700 --> 00:55:53,340
check out all the great shit that they have there.

919
00:55:53,340 --> 00:55:54,220
I'm sorry I called it shit.

920
00:55:54,220 --> 00:55:55,060
It's not shit.

921
00:55:55,060 --> 00:55:55,900
It's good podcasts.

922
00:55:55,900 --> 00:55:56,780
Let's hear it, Griffin.

923
00:55:56,780 --> 00:55:57,620
Let's hear that final yahoo.

924
00:55:57,620 --> 00:56:00,220
This one was sent in by Davin.

925
00:56:00,220 --> 00:56:05,220
And Davin sent it in and it was sent in today.

926
00:56:05,820 --> 00:56:06,660
Oh, fuck.

927
00:56:06,660 --> 00:56:08,460
Today, this morning.

928
00:56:08,460 --> 00:56:11,220
It's a yahoo answers from,

929
00:56:11,220 --> 00:56:14,340
and this one was asked by Batman.

930
00:56:14,340 --> 00:56:15,180
Ooh.

931
00:56:15,180 --> 00:56:16,020
Asks.

932
00:56:19,060 --> 00:56:20,340
Batman asks,

933
00:56:24,380 --> 00:56:27,260
does anyone know where to,

934
00:56:28,140 --> 00:56:31,580
does anyone do any repairs?

935
00:56:31,580 --> 00:56:36,580
Does anyone know where to get repairs done on my dad?

936
00:56:40,180 --> 00:56:42,020
Does anyone know where to get that?

937
00:56:42,020 --> 00:56:45,420
Does anyone know a good dad repair shop in Houston, Texas?

938
00:56:47,620 --> 00:56:49,740
I thought he was toast to McElroy.

939
00:56:49,740 --> 00:56:51,580
I'm Griffin McElroy.

940
00:56:51,580 --> 00:56:52,500
This has been my brother, my brother,

941
00:56:52,500 --> 00:56:54,580
may you kiss your dad's square on the lips.

942
00:56:54,580 --> 00:57:03,480
One, it's better with you.

943
00:57:03,480 --> 00:57:06,180
It's better, it's better with you.

944
00:57:06,180 --> 00:57:07,100
It's better with you.

945
00:57:07,100 --> 00:57:10,080
My life, end by Von Michael,

946
00:57:10,080 --> 00:57:12,300
it's not got the better with you.

947
00:57:12,300 --> 00:57:16,180
It's the truer, it's better, it's better with two.

948
00:57:16,180 --> 00:57:18,180
It's better with you

949
00:57:18,180 --> 00:57:19,300
My life

950
00:57:19,300 --> 00:57:23,640
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah

951
00:57:23,640 --> 00:57:50,640
It's better with you
