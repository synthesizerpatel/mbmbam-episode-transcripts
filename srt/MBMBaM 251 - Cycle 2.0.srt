1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:31,120
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool...

5
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:51,520
Hello everybody, and welcome to cycle 2.0 of my brother, my brother, and me.

6
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:55,360
I'm Justin McElroy, an oldest brother.

7
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,040
I'm Travis McElroy, and I'm your middle-est brother.

8
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:02,240
I'm Chaz McElroy, your baby.

9
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:06,560
We had to rebrand Griffin. We're trying to pull in a different demographic.

10
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:14,000
It's cycle 2.0. 250 episodes was season one, and now this is cycle 2.0 of my brother,

11
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,400
my brother, and me. A new chapter begins today.

12
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:21,680
Justin, it's actually now it's Powerade Presents My Brother, My Brother, and Me.

13
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:25,680
Sorry, you're right. I forgot. Powerade Presents My Brother, My Brother, and Me,

14
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:31,280
cycle 2.0, and boys are in the house, but that's been the situation for a while.

15
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:33,280
Travis, what are some of the big changes, you think,

16
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:36,080
coming in cycle 2.0 of my brother, my brother, and me?

17
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:38,000
Well, we added a talking dog.

18
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,400
We should point out, I am the talking dog, Chaz.

19
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:41,520
A talking dog named Chaz McElroy.

20
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:44,480
We had to really rebrand Griffin a lot.

21
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:48,880
Listen, we sat the focus group down for 250 hours.

22
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:53,440
They were in our house for six weeks. It was miserable.

23
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:58,560
They ate all of my Doritos, and they said, the only feedback they gave us was,

24
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:04,160
A, you need a long-lasting, refreshing corporate sponsorship,

25
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:08,560
and Travis immediately was like, Powerade, and he called up his people at Powerade,

26
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:11,280
and then they were like, of course we're on board.

27
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:15,280
One thing we're going to need, though, is it too late to introduce a talking dog?

28
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:17,760
And also, we're not crazy about the youngest one,

29
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:19,600
and then we said, two birds, one stone.

30
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:23,040
I got elective dog surgery on my whole body.

31
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:28,800
They basically cut my whole body off and replaced it with where there were human parts.

32
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:31,040
They took each human part, replaced it with the dog part,

33
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:33,520
and then I was like, okay, I'm Griffin the dog,

34
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:36,240
and then the focus group was like, oh, we've made a terrible mistake.

35
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:38,720
Is it too late to reverse the surgery?

36
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:41,920
Also, are we married to the name Griffin?

37
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:46,880
And I said, I guess not, but yes, on the reversing the surgery thing.

38
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:47,280
I'm a dog for life.

39
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:48,960
They'd already thrown away his body.

40
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:51,760
You can do a full body replacement once,

41
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:54,320
but any more than that, and you're just playing God.

42
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:58,400
Anyway, long story short, I can't stop eating my own asshole.

43
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:01,920
I have promises.

44
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:05,920
I want to make promises to the audience in cycle 2.0 of My Brother, My Brother, Me.

45
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:09,520
One, the stunts are going to get wetter.

46
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:12,400
Two, the challenges are going to get bigger and wilder.

47
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:17,360
Three, four new judges that will be revealed as the season progresses.

48
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:19,440
Oh, man, these are going to be some juicy stunts.

49
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:22,160
These aren't going to be the wettest stunts yet.

50
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:26,000
Like really wild, wild challenges, wet stunts.

51
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:28,080
Look at this way.

52
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:31,120
Listening to it from home, stunts are going to be so wet,

53
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:32,240
you're going to have moist ears.

54
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:35,120
You're going to have the moistest ears.

55
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:36,480
We talked to the focus group and they were like,

56
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:38,560
you got to drop the quiz section from the show.

57
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:40,080
You got to drop the quiz segment.

58
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:42,240
It's where all of your viewers tune out.

59
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:43,600
And so we're dropping those.

60
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:48,560
It's all stunts now, all challenge games and all trust activities.

61
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:53,680
We're going to do a lot of team building exercises in cycle 2.0.

62
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:55,120
Going to take me to a low ropes course.

63
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:58,480
I am going to have trouble with it because of my new short, short dog legs.

64
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:02,240
We actually are doing this episode, Griffin's blindfolded

65
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:05,680
and Justin's giving him directions to get around the jokes.

66
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:08,560
So that's, it's just the kind of thing we're bringing.

67
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:11,040
But really, really, really though, really though?

68
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:12,640
Isn't that how it's always been?

69
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:13,600
Basically, yeah.

70
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:15,440
Listen, let's get to the advice.

71
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:20,000
That's one of the things in cycle 2.0 is enough of this kind of thing.

72
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:24,320
But it's going to be just so you're prepared, advice, stunt,

73
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:28,800
then two advices, then two stunts and so on until we've gone for an hour.

74
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:30,080
Physical challenge.

75
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:33,840
Right, well, that's only if Travis lies.

76
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:35,760
If Travis ever lies, we have to do a physical challenge.

77
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:40,000
It's going to be very confusing for 250 episodes,

78
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,960
but then by 501, we're going to be on some new shit.

79
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:44,480
Maybe I'll get my man body back.

80
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:48,400
I also just, I real quick wanted to say happy birthday to my wife, Teresa.

81
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:52,320
And I will miss her very much since the producers cut her from the show.

82
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:54,240
Yeah, she's out now.

83
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:55,520
But I loved her.

84
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:58,640
I loved her with the time we had and happy birthday.

85
00:04:58,640 --> 00:05:00,320
Maybe you'll get maybe you'll get remarried.

86
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:02,160
This is maybe that'll be part of the reboot.

87
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:03,040
That will be a twist.

88
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:06,960
No, she's already started dating George Lopez on his show.

89
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:08,640
Well, she's dating him on the pilot.

90
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:09,040
We'll see.

91
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:10,320
Yeah, that's true.

92
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:10,800
You're right.

93
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:18,160
Listen, normally we forget about these bits much like yourself as soon as we record them.

94
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:24,160
But today, if the youngest member of our show is referred to as anything other than Chaz,

95
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:30,480
I will immediately disconnect the call and we'll just have to reschedule another time

96
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:32,160
where we're more in the zone.

97
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:36,080
And by this episode, you mean for the next five years?

98
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:36,720
Well, right.

99
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:38,880
For the next 250 episodes, whichever comes first.

100
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:42,320
Okay, Travis, Chaz, are you ready?

101
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:42,560
Yes.

102
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:46,560
Ever since I was a kid, I was told how well I clean up.

103
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:50,720
Whenever I put on something nice like a suit or a dress shirt and style my hair,

104
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:53,520
I get told by people I clean up really well.

105
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:55,120
I always found this offensive.

106
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:57,120
Do I look like a pilot dump before that?

107
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:59,040
Not sure if I should take it as a compliment or an insult.

108
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:01,760
That's from moderately offended in Ohio.

109
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:04,960
Find better things to get upset about.

110
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:05,840
Next question.

111
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:07,760
That's a new thing in cycle 2.0.

112
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:10,400
We're gonna do 800 questions per episode.

113
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:12,880
Yeah, we're just gonna say that to basically everybody.

114
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:16,160
There's another side to this situation.

115
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:18,800
My friend Jeremy Dubin dresses nice every day.

116
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:23,920
Like dress shirt, tie, like a dapper vest every day.

117
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:25,120
Yeah, you're bragging now.

118
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:30,000
Well, so when he wears a t-shirt and jeans, everybody grows concerned and is like,

119
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:30,560
are you okay?

120
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:32,480
Are you feeling sick?

121
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:33,760
Are you not feeling well?

122
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:36,000
So it goes the other way too, where it's like,

123
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:40,240
oh, I guess you clean down really poorly.

124
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:46,880
Travis has just described my Twilight Zone hell where me wearing cargo shorts

125
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:50,480
and a Tybee Island, it's five o'clock somewhere t-shirt

126
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:54,800
invites more conversation than I do on a day-to-day life.

127
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:58,160
I, when I possessed a human man body,

128
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:06,320
I had a very different problem where I would dress like a pilot dump all the time.

129
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:10,960
Except when one of my friends decided to get married and put me out

130
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:16,720
and I would put on a suit and I would look like a large,

131
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:22,960
very sophisticated ventriloquist dummy because there's no suits that fit my body

132
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:25,440
that don't make me look like a sick boy.

133
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:29,040
Now, this is not a problem I have to deal with anymore, fortunately.

134
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:29,840
Thank goodness.

135
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:31,120
One of many benefits.

136
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:32,560
Of dog body.

137
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:33,680
Of dog body, yeah.

138
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:38,320
I don't think it's an insult, but it's definitely a commentary.

139
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:44,080
I think that maybe, what do you normally wear?

140
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:50,240
Is this a way of saying you normally maybe strive for a higher level like this all the time?

141
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:54,720
Or do you think it's just people, usually you only see this in movies

142
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:57,360
when someone shaves off a big, bratty beard.

143
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:59,280
Right, or takes off their glasses.

144
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:02,240
And Rachel Lee Cook was always under those glasses.

145
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:05,360
They were always, she was always under those glasses.

146
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:08,160
And it's your fault for not having imagination.

147
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:10,000
And also she looked really great with the glasses.

148
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,360
What the fuck's wrong with you?

149
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:13,680
Freddie Prinze Jr.

150
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:15,520
Get it together, FPJ.

151
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:20,000
I think that, you know, it's just a pleasantry.

152
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:25,040
They're just acknowledging that you're wearing a clothing that is one, like,

153
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:28,320
formal notch higher than what you normally wear.

154
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:30,800
They're just like acknowledging it because otherwise,

155
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:34,320
think about like if you just wore a tux and in your head you're like,

156
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:39,040
dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun, like everybody who wears a tux at any point,

157
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:41,280
singing the James Bond theme song to themselves,

158
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,040
and no one paid, noticed it, that would be terrible.

159
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:45,760
That would be a bummer.

160
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:47,040
That would be a real bummer.

161
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:48,640
I think they're just like, it's just a pleasantry.

162
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:50,880
Like, hey, I'm noticing you're wearing something.

163
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:56,560
But it is said in a very diminutive, you clean up real well.

164
00:08:58,400 --> 00:09:00,000
It's like an old-timey pleasantry.

165
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:00,960
It's just like a-

166
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:04,240
Back in the old times when everyone was dicks, right?

167
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:04,560
Yeah.

168
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:05,840
It's time for us to move on.

169
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:09,920
You're 110%, that's what I want now.

170
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:11,840
Normally you're 100%, I would say.

171
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:15,440
Now you've added an extra 10 on top of that because you're wearing a cummerbund.

172
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:18,400
Have you guys noticed that people of a generation before us,

173
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:21,600
and maybe even like two generations before us technically,

174
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:29,600
like, tend to keep the formality like one to two notches higher constantly?

175
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:30,240
Like-

176
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:32,080
Even in speech or in clothes?

177
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:39,920
Like in clothes, I very regularly see like old dudes doing yard work in khakis.

178
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:46,400
And they like look like they are like uncomfortable in the khakis like to relax.

179
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:48,720
Like, boy, I'm really letting it all hang out.

180
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:51,520
I mean khakis and a tucked in polo shirt.

181
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:57,040
I've been working on this pejorative slang term for people in generations older than mine.

182
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:58,560
And I just want to bounce it off you guys.

183
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:00,800
And then I'm going to take it to the focus group and see what they think about it.

184
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:08,080
But how do you feel about calling people of our daddy or our grandma's generation shirt tuckers?

185
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:10,480
Because they're the only people left that are still, you know,

186
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:12,240
practicing that particular behavior.

187
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:15,840
I like that, Griffin, because it's got a lot of fun consonant sounds in it.

188
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:16,640
Right, and it's-

189
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:18,240
Oh, he's a real shirt tucker.

190
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:18,960
You know what I mean?

191
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:19,440
There's no-

192
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:20,480
There are two reasons.

193
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:23,680
The only reason you would tuck your shirt in is you're really proud of your belt.

194
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:25,040
And you want people to see that.

195
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:25,920
But otherwise you're just-

196
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:29,440
Or you're on mad TV and you're doing an impression of a shirt tucker.

197
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:30,560
Like a shirt tucker character.

198
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:30,960
Exactly.

199
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:32,000
Right, exactly.

200
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:37,040
Otherwise, it's just your shirt's touching your pubis at that point.

201
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:38,000
And I don't want to think of it.

202
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:38,880
You're making me think-

203
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:42,240
Every time I see anybody with their shirt tucked in, I just look at them and I go, ugh.

204
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:43,680
Because I think about what's going on in there.

205
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:44,480
You're basically-

206
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:48,160
It's just basically just a grift to convince people your shirt doesn't have a bottom to it.

207
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:48,560
Yeah.

208
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:50,240
Like, we know it does.

209
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:52,720
Like, you're raising the question, does my shirt end?

210
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:53,520
I don't know.

211
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:54,400
You'll never know.

212
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:55,520
Maybe it's a nice shirt.

213
00:10:55,520 --> 00:10:56,640
Maybe it goes all the way to my ankle.

214
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:57,040
Right, that's another-

215
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:58,320
I'm not wearing footies.

216
00:10:58,320 --> 00:10:59,600
It's a onesie, right?

217
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:01,280
It's a button-down onesie.

218
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:02,880
I'm gonna start asking people.

219
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:04,800
You know, their shirt's tucked in.

220
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:07,120
They say, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

221
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:07,840
Is that a onesie?

222
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:09,120
Does that go all the way down?

223
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:10,400
Go all the way down.

224
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:12,400
Well, can I see your leg cuffs?

225
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:14,880
Take off your pants to prove that's not a onesie.

226
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:15,520
Shirt tucker.

227
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:19,520
Off air, I want to talk to you guys about the possibility of me starting to wear a jumpsuit

228
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:20,240
as like a look.

229
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:23,680
I don't see why that's a conversation that can't take place on the show, Travis.

230
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:24,720
Is that a thing I should do?

231
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:26,080
Should we take it to the focus group?

232
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:26,800
Oh, yes.

233
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:31,760
Like, I think a jumpsuit with embroidered lightning on it.

234
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:32,640
You know what I mean?

235
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:35,280
And I mean the word lightning, not a picture of lightning.

236
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:37,520
Or the word lightning made out of lightning.

237
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:38,960
Oh, man, we got that.

238
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:39,520
We got some sanity.

239
00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:42,640
Little presumptuous, though, that you think that you could come up with your own nickname

240
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:44,880
and the focus group would be down with it because, like, I don't know.

241
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:45,760
If I had my druthers-

242
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:46,720
And yeah, I'm not complaining.

243
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:49,760
I feel like it's gonna be really great for the show, but God, I wish I was a man, boy

244
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:51,920
person, human person still.

245
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:55,200
Well, but Griffin, when we signed the Rich and Famous contract-

246
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:57,040
What did you call me?

247
00:11:57,040 --> 00:11:58,080
I'm sorry, Chaz.

248
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:00,720
And there goes the call.

249
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:03,040
Well, the call's been disconnected.

250
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:05,040
At this point, I've disconnected the call.

251
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:08,480
So you're probably hearing different things from my brothers.

252
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:09,360
I'm calling them back now.

253
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:12,560
And we're back.

254
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:13,520
And we're back.

255
00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:14,240
Okay, we're back.

256
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:17,280
Let's not do that again, guys, because I think it's gonna be disorienting.

257
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:18,800
Whatever the listener just heard.

258
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:19,920
Yeah, are we back?

259
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:21,040
Is everybody still recording?

260
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:22,320
I don't want the episode.

261
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:22,880
Okay, good.

262
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:24,160
How about a Yahoo?

263
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:25,360
Hit me, Chaz.

264
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:30,640
This Yahoo was sent in by Ira Ray.

265
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:33,120
Are you Ira Ray?

266
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:34,000
Who wants to know?

267
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:34,640
Thank you, Ira Ray.

268
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:36,320
It's by Yahoo Answers User.

269
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:38,640
In Cycle 2.0, we sang the whole song.

270
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:41,200
Oh, God, we don't have the rights for that.

271
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:49,040
Tulip Blushie asks, I need a good intro for a spelling bee speech.

272
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:53,920
I am running a spelling bee, and I would like a catchy intro to start off my speech.

273
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:54,960
Any suggestions?

274
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,960
Y'all ready to start spell?

275
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:01,680
No, fuck.

276
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:02,160
It's hard.

277
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:03,920
I see why they came to us with this.

278
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:07,920
Because I thought I was just gonna be able to shit one out, but it's tricky.

279
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:09,360
Get on up and spell.

280
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:12,880
Well, that's not really the start of the speech.

281
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:14,160
Spelling you later.

282
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:15,520
The more I think about it, if it's the speech...

283
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:16,720
Sorry, what is the speech?

284
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:18,560
What is the speech?

285
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:22,720
It's how before a spelling bee, somebody gets up there to get everybody fucking hyped.

286
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:27,840
Okay, first thing, I think you gotta start off saying the word combatants.

287
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:30,000
Welcome, combatants.

288
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:34,880
Combatants, today you find yourselves in the battle dome.

289
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:35,680
And you would...

290
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:38,320
Sorry, it would have to take place in a battle dome.

291
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:42,000
Oh, yeah, you gotta drop a chain link cage over them.

292
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,280
Yeah, that's the part.

293
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:44,880
Okay, so let me start over.

294
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:45,920
Okay.

295
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:46,480
Combatants.

296
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:47,920
Solid.

297
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:50,560
Combatants of Lamar Middle School.

298
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,120
Thank you all for coming.

299
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:56,800
Parents, thank you for supporting your children in this endeavor.

300
00:13:58,400 --> 00:14:00,080
Just try your hardest out there.

301
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:05,840
And remember, even if you get kicked off, we've got some Capri Sun pouches

302
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:09,280
waiting for you offstage to refresh yourselves.

303
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:13,200
Remember, we're only gonna be able to send three students to the state bee.

304
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:16,240
All that being said, drop the cage!

305
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:21,600
And then the cage would drop, and maybe one or two students would get caught underneath it.

306
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:25,200
And that's just like, that's the rules of the game, baby.

307
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:26,960
Like, you gotta keep your wits about you in the bee.

308
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:31,760
Okay, but if you're gonna do that move, I think that Lamar Middle School is gonna have to bring in

309
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:36,960
a ringer, maybe somebody who's won some cage match spelling bees before.

310
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:38,080
I see, I see.

311
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:40,880
Maybe he's like four or five years older than these other kids.

312
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:42,240
Maybe he's 19 years older.

313
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:43,360
He's 19 years older.

314
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:48,480
Yeah, and he's ripped, and he's bald, and like, covered in ash.

315
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:52,000
And he's got tattoos made out of blood all over his body.

316
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,400
They just spell out F-U-C-K-Y-O-U.

317
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:58,480
Right, and his teeth are made of steel, rusted steel.

318
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:02,080
He's got a bolt through his forehead.

319
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:05,520
I think, wait, hold on, okay?

320
00:15:05,520 --> 00:15:06,720
I'm picturing it.

321
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:11,520
And he's got sharp bone spurs sticking out of his back.

322
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:13,920
And he's kind of like a wasteland monstrosity.

323
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:17,360
And he wants everybody to know, I'm in charge of this spelling bee.

324
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:21,120
I think in order to get a weapon, you should have to spell it.

325
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:25,920
Like if you spell K-A-T-A-N-A, like a katana drops from the ceiling.

326
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:27,280
Oh, that's great.

327
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:28,960
Wouldn't that be good?

328
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:29,680
Oh, too late.

329
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:33,600
You've been chewed to death by the wasteland spelling monster.

330
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:37,440
You've been stabbed to death because unfortunately, psi is super easy to spell.

331
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:38,560
It's just three letters.

332
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:39,520
You should have thought of that.

333
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:44,960
Michael, your word is mercy.

334
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:45,760
I'm sorry.

335
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:47,200
I don't know the meaning of the word.

336
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:48,720
Oh, would you like the definition?

337
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:49,120
Yes, please.

338
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:49,920
That would be great.

339
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:51,040
Use it in a sentence.

340
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:51,840
Use it in a sentence.

341
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:52,800
No mercy for you.

342
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:54,000
I'm the wasteland killer.

343
00:15:56,720 --> 00:16:00,240
I have long kicked around the idea of like,

344
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:05,040
wouldn't it be fun to do a My Brother, My Brother, Me game jam

345
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:08,160
where for 48 hours, people make video games.

346
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:12,000
You know, little games based on ideas, concepts, images,

347
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:14,320
words from My Brother, My Brother, Me.

348
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:16,560
I've always thought that would be a good idea.

349
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:21,200
Now I feel like it has to happen so I can fucking play spelling bee battledome.

350
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:24,400
Like, this sounds like a really good game.

351
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:25,600
Sounds like a really good game.

352
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:26,480
Can I add a twist?

353
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:29,520
Yeah, yeah, of course.

354
00:16:29,520 --> 00:16:31,520
I love adding twists to things.

355
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:33,280
That's what Chaz is all about.

356
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:36,080
Chaz is all about putting lemon wedges in his drinks.

357
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:42,720
CycleTube has wetter stunts, bigger challenges, wilder twists.

358
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:44,640
Here's a wild twist.

359
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:49,920
All of the children have to hold an actual bee.

360
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:54,000
And if they let it go because it stings them

361
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:58,480
or crush it to death because it stings them, the kid's getting stung.

362
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:03,440
But if the bee is released or destroyed, the child is out of the bee.

363
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:07,440
Oh, and all of the contestants have to have bee allergies.

364
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:11,520
Well, no, I mean, that would be a significant strength, right?

365
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:13,440
So Terrence gets up to the mic, right?

366
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:14,800
And he's like, what's my word?

367
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:16,320
And the word is Appalachian.

368
00:17:16,320 --> 00:17:20,320
And he's like, cool, let me think about it for like 15 minutes.

369
00:17:20,320 --> 00:17:21,840
And the other kids are being stung.

370
00:17:21,840 --> 00:17:24,080
But fucking Terrence, not allergic.

371
00:17:24,080 --> 00:17:25,520
And his dad-

372
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:28,720
He's just holding his bee by the wing like some sort of zen master.

373
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:32,240
His dad, who won the battledome spelling bee in 1995,

374
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:36,320
knew what was coming and surgically altered the nerves in his hands.

375
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:38,880
So he can't feel a goddamn thing down there.

376
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:42,000
He'll never know the touch of another person.

377
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,520
But he's going to win that bee.

378
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:49,360
Terrence, it seems your right arm is rotting off from poison,

379
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:50,800
from the toxins of the bee.

380
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:51,200
Oh, sorry.

381
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:55,200
They're super nano bees that have all kinds of nano poisons and stuff.

382
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:57,840
They're like the size of a medium sized dove.

383
00:17:57,840 --> 00:17:58,640
You know what I would do?

384
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:02,880
I would be like, I would be the real hard ass kid.

385
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:05,120
I would just swallow it instantly.

386
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:06,640
Like that bee's not going anywhere.

387
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:08,640
And they're like, but the bee's probably dead now.

388
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:10,480
And it's like, you'll have to cut me open to find out.

389
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:10,880
That sounds-

390
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:13,120
And then get cut open by the wasteland monster.

391
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:15,600
Well, no, he's a pacifist.

392
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:17,040
He's just really good at spelling.

393
00:18:17,040 --> 00:18:18,560
And he's super allergic to bees.

394
00:18:18,560 --> 00:18:19,520
That's his one weakness.

395
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:21,200
It's an intimidation game.

396
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:23,840
He's just trying to make the kids mess up at spelling.

397
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:24,880
It's like a haunted house.

398
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:30,080
Like listen, the wasteland monster cannot touch you and you cannot touch the wasteland monster.

399
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:32,000
Because if you do, oh my God.

400
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:34,000
Wow.

401
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:34,960
Oh wow, it's bad.

402
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:37,040
We're not responsible for your safety.

403
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:39,280
So I think if you just get up and that's the intro.

404
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:42,240
Word for word, everything we just said.

405
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:43,680
Spell, spell real good.

406
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:44,320
Watch the cage.

407
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:46,320
Don't touch the wasteland monster.

408
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:46,880
Oh my God.

409
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:48,640
That last part is the most important part.

410
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:50,000
I cannot stress this enough.

411
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,160
If the cage falls on you, you might be okay.

412
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:54,640
If you touch the wasteland monster, that's it.

413
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:57,520
Just remember, if the cage falls on you, that's merciful.

414
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:00,480
It's a good way to go.

415
00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:04,400
And if it goes past the two-hour time limit, we electrify the cage.

416
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:05,440
So yeah, for sure.

417
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:09,040
We got to, because we have to be out of the gymnasium by three.

418
00:19:09,040 --> 00:19:11,360
Yeah, they're having a PTA meeting.

419
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:14,000
And we have to put the mats down.

420
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:16,960
You guys, we got to be out of here by three.

421
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:20,720
Also, the wasteland monster has a night shift at the 7-Eleven.

422
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:21,920
He's got to get to.

423
00:19:21,920 --> 00:19:25,680
Also, if you get one of your arms lopped off, go ahead and tap out

424
00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:27,840
because you're not going to be able to enjoy that Capri Sun

425
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:29,360
if you lose both of your arms.

426
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:30,000
That's true.

427
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:30,160
Right.

428
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:30,880
You need one.

429
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:34,880
You need one to apply pressure to the pouch and the other to apply the straw.

430
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:36,320
Exactly.

431
00:19:37,040 --> 00:19:39,520
What do we got planned for our listeners?

432
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:40,480
What?

433
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:42,960
Very wet stunt.

434
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:45,200
Oh, for our first super wet stunt?

435
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:45,760
Yeah.

436
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:46,000
Okay.

437
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,360
For our first super wet stunt.

438
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:48,160
I got a cup of water here.

439
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:52,240
I can pour it on my dog penis.

440
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:53,360
Who doesn't love that?

441
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:58,240
I could get really crazy and sexual with this Powerade bottle.

442
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:01,600
Well, that's what they're paying for.

443
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:02,000
Okay.

444
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:02,240
Right.

445
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:03,360
Here's the first stunt.

446
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:05,440
It's a crowd participation stunt.

447
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:05,680
Okay.

448
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:12,560
Right now, right this second, grab the nearest cup, fill it with the nearest liquid,

449
00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:16,240
take a picture of yourself drinking it, and tweet it to MBMBAM.

450
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:17,120
Well, no, because it could be-

451
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:18,160
And we'll retweet them.

452
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:20,720
And then it's just like, that's like the first stunt.

453
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:21,520
It's like a big prank.

454
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:23,280
And you get bonus points if it's Powerade.

455
00:20:24,560 --> 00:20:24,800
Yeah.

456
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:28,400
If the Powerade label is prominent, that would be excellent.

457
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:29,360
Let's just edit it.

458
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:30,160
Edit this.

459
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:31,040
Here we go.

460
00:20:31,040 --> 00:20:32,400
Here's your first stunt.

461
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:33,840
Go buy and drink some Powerade.

462
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:36,000
They're gonna love that.

463
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,680
Don't drink the first liquid that's close to you,

464
00:20:37,680 --> 00:20:40,000
because if you're doing laundry right now, you're dead.

465
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:40,800
And that's on us.

466
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:42,080
Yeah.

467
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:42,640
I want Powerade-

468
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:44,320
Just tweet a picture of yourself drinking Powerade.

469
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:47,600
Use the MBMBAM hashtag so we know.

470
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:49,520
And the hashtag Powerade hashtag.

471
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:54,080
Hashtag the Thirst Annihilator.

472
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:57,600
Hashtag Power Boys, which is special.

473
00:20:57,600 --> 00:20:59,760
It's how they track like our efficacy.

474
00:21:01,040 --> 00:21:03,680
Power Boys with three Z's, and each one of those that happens,

475
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:04,960
we get like 15 bucks.

476
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:05,600
So yeah.

477
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:06,880
I met Jackie Chan.

478
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:07,920
He's super awesome.

479
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:10,160
What?

480
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:13,200
My brother was doing a commercial in Hong Kong when he was like five,

481
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:15,120
and he was the most stubborn child you can imagine.

482
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:19,680
However, Jackie Chan won him over every day by bringing him a little toy.

483
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:20,880
Do not worry.

484
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:24,160
Jackie Chan is just as cool and kindhearted as you imagine him being.

485
00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:26,320
Tim, not a question, Tim.

486
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:28,080
But I certainly do appreciate-

487
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:28,640
Holy shit.

488
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:29,920
Your email.

489
00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:30,800
Can you every-

490
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:31,280
Okay.

491
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:33,120
Jackie Chan won him over every day.

492
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:34,640
That means multiple days.

493
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:39,120
Jackie Chan fucking stopped by KB kids toy store.

494
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:41,920
And was like, gotta get something for Jeremy.

495
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:44,320
That's what Jackie Chan sounds like.

496
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:45,040
You nailed it.

497
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:47,440
What do you think Jeremy would like?

498
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:48,960
Maybe a super soaker.

499
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:52,080
And then by the end of the week, seven super soakers,

500
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:54,880
all signed by Jackie Chan, which makes them more powerful.

501
00:21:56,160 --> 00:22:00,640
Did the kid have blank slate disease that like he forgot the day before

502
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:02,160
Jackie Chan had won him over?

503
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:04,720
Or was he just like, well, you got today, Chan.

504
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:06,320
What are you going to bring today?

505
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:08,720
Did Jackie Chan have blank slate disease?

506
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:10,560
I have got to win over this little kid.

507
00:22:10,560 --> 00:22:13,040
Dude, he's a tough nut to crack.

508
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:15,120
Wait, man, you already got six super soakers.

509
00:22:15,680 --> 00:22:17,200
And now you're signing them all of them?

510
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:17,840
Wait a minute.

511
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:20,240
What a goose I am.

512
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:23,520
Anyway, here's some back flip.

513
00:22:26,160 --> 00:22:28,000
Do you guys remember that time in Philadelphia?

514
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:28,320
Yeah.

515
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:29,360
Okay.

516
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:36,080
I can't- after I said that,

517
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:38,080
I feel like we probably told that story on the show before.

518
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:38,720
Probably.

519
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:39,600
Anyway.

520
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:43,760
We saw a guy in the streets of Philadelphia who came up to our family and said,

521
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:46,320
I do something the whole family can enjoy, backflips.

522
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:48,480
And we were down.

523
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:49,520
And he was right.

524
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:50,640
I did enjoy it very much.

525
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:51,680
It was awesome.

526
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:55,600
I want you at home, if you're listening to this in your car or your office,

527
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:58,320
I want you to take a second, think about the relationships in your life.

528
00:22:58,320 --> 00:23:03,760
Jackie Chan every day bought a toy to win over

529
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:07,440
just some kid that he was shooting a commercial with.

530
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:09,040
Are you bringing that level?

531
00:23:09,040 --> 00:23:14,160
Are you bringing Jackie Chan levels of consideration and intensity to the relationships

532
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:16,960
that really matter to you in your day-to-day life?

533
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:21,440
Don't let yourself be outpaced by Jackie Chan.

534
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:24,480
Well, but you don't have a choice because he's very, very fast.

535
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:27,600
He's laps ahead of you at this point, but you can try to catch up.

536
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:32,560
WW- well, WWJCD.

537
00:23:32,560 --> 00:23:34,400
That's not particular- that is not different.

538
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:35,360
Whoa.

539
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:36,480
Whoa.

540
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:37,120
Hold on.

541
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:37,600
Hold the-

542
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:40,160
Hold the phone.

543
00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:42,400
I mean, I don't- I think it was just WWJD.

544
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:44,000
I don't think they were that formal with it.

545
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:47,200
But still, I mean, either way, no matter which way you slice it.

546
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:49,520
Jackie Chan is Jesus.

547
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:51,280
Well, I'm not saying that.

548
00:23:51,280 --> 00:23:52,000
Oh.

549
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:52,400
I'm just saying-

550
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:53,040
I am.

551
00:23:53,040 --> 00:23:53,920
I- you know what?

552
00:23:53,920 --> 00:23:54,640
I am.

553
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:57,920
I'm ready to finally go out on a limb and just be honest here and say-

554
00:23:57,920 --> 00:24:01,120
So are you saying- are you- so would you extend this to everybody?

555
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:02,000
Is that like saying,

556
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:05,840
Oh, this is- this is my friend, American roots rocker at Jesus Christ melon camp.

557
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:06,640
Is that what you're saying?

558
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:10,640
Which is- this is my friend, JC Chazee, who is also Jackie Chan.

559
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:16,720
A good friend and classmate just started a new campus job as brand ambassador.

560
00:24:17,280 --> 00:24:19,120
Sorry, that was a hard word to say.

561
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:20,080
Brand ambassador.

562
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:21,760
Brand brand ambassador.

563
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:26,480
My good friend and classmate just started a new campus job as a brand ambassador for a local

564
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:26,880
company.

565
00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:31,840
We all went to the info session, but she's the only one who got super excited about it.

566
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:36,880
Now all she ever talks about is this company and this job and she blows off school and

567
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:38,480
friends for it constantly.

568
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:42,320
How can I delicately tell her that she's driving everybody fucking crazy?

569
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:47,040
This is from board of brands in Boise and the fact that you did not tell us the brand.

570
00:24:47,040 --> 00:24:47,920
What the fuck?

571
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:48,800
Or what a brand ambassador is.

572
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:50,400
DQ'd this emailed.

573
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:52,320
I- I-

574
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:52,800
It's DQ.

575
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:53,520
It's Dairy Queen.

576
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:56,640
Hot Eats Cool Treats.

577
00:24:56,640 --> 00:24:58,480
That's this person's tease.

578
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:02,480
I- I mean, if the brand is Powerade, I get it.

579
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:03,760
They're a wonderful company.

580
00:25:04,560 --> 00:25:06,240
They treat their workers with respect.

581
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:07,600
I'm told.

582
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:13,280
I think a brand ambassador- a brand ambassador is like the person that like, you know, is

583
00:25:13,280 --> 00:25:18,000
wearing like an embroidered, you know, like a polo shirt and they come up and they're

584
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:24,160
like, hey, can I tell you about AT&T or like, hey, would you guys like to try some of this

585
00:25:24,160 --> 00:25:29,520
Jamba Juice or whatever and like, they just kind of walk around and like, bring the marketing

586
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:30,320
to you, right?

587
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:36,160
Do they legally have to, like, identify themselves or is it just like you're saying it's somebody

588
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:38,480
on the train and they're like, Jamba Juice.

589
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:39,040
Heard of it.

590
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:40,480
Catch the wave.

591
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:45,920
Oh, are you saying like maybe it's an underco- or what they do is they do like buzz marketing

592
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:49,600
where they go into like a bar and they're like, I've heard really good things about

593
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:50,800
Sierra Nevada, right?

594
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:51,760
Yeah, if that's the thing-

595
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:53,360
I've wanted to try that for a while.

596
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:58,880
If that's the- the- the- what's going on, then I have been a brand ambassador for Gold

597
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:02,880
Bond dryness powder since I was born.

598
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:03,760
Well, not since I was born, but-

599
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:05,680
Alright, listen, this conversation's going great.

600
00:26:05,680 --> 00:26:10,160
Want to hear more about how much you miss your Aunt Terry, but I have got to take a

601
00:26:10,160 --> 00:26:10,960
GV break.

602
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:12,640
Excuse me, everybody.

603
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:16,800
And if you try this stuff, it is out of this world.

604
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:19,600
You just stand up at the table and that's it, you're full on.

605
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:21,200
Hey, where's your shitter?

606
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:22,400
I need to go puff.

607
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:23,680
What are you talking about?

608
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:30,080
I scoot it over a- I scoot it over a turlet seat and I do a puff so it makes it look like

609
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:31,040
a genie's coming out.

610
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:36,800
You want to give her a try?

611
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:38,400
Take her for a test spin.

612
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:38,960
Take her for a try.

613
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:43,040
I've got a special- here, listen, I've got a- listen, I've got a reusable applicator

614
00:26:43,040 --> 00:26:45,120
that I can just pop on there for you.

615
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:48,160
Just make sure that you wash it off in the sink.

616
00:26:48,160 --> 00:26:51,280
Don't get any water in the powder because it'll compromise it.

617
00:26:51,280 --> 00:26:55,440
My Gold Bond Medicated Powder has two trays that you can open.

618
00:26:55,440 --> 00:27:00,240
One's a big one and it says for me, and then there's a little one that says for them.

619
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:01,440
It's like for guests.

620
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:03,360
It's like guest Gold Bond Medicated Powder.

621
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:07,280
And the bartender just stares at you and he's like, oh my God, a talking dog.

622
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:10,960
I don't believe it.

623
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:13,920
This night has gotten pretty rough.

624
00:27:13,920 --> 00:27:15,600
And then you're like, ah, good one.

625
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:16,080
Got it.

626
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:20,320
Yeah, I guess maybe an email.

627
00:27:23,280 --> 00:27:25,600
Maybe some kind of well-worded note.

628
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:27,760
Yeah, this doesn't seem like a mouth conversation to me.

629
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:32,160
No, because what if she's deep into this brand?

630
00:27:32,160 --> 00:27:32,960
What if it's like-

631
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:35,600
We have to pick a brand because this conversation is too confusing.

632
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:36,480
Okay, pick a brand.

633
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:40,400
Emerald Nuts.

634
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:40,880
Emerald Nuts?

635
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:42,320
Emerald Nuts, right?

636
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:44,240
Oh, that seems likely.

637
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:45,680
She's nuts about nuts, right?

638
00:27:45,680 --> 00:27:46,960
She's losing it.

639
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:48,160
I think you got to go to her.

640
00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:52,320
But if you're like, hey, you need to fucking cut it out with all the Emerald Nuts shit.

641
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:53,040
We're over it.

642
00:27:53,040 --> 00:27:55,360
And she's like, but have you guys tried it yet?

643
00:27:55,360 --> 00:27:59,920
And I think it's just a circuitous, maddening cycle.

644
00:27:59,920 --> 00:28:05,360
But instead, you leave an anonymous note that's like, we've heard enough about the nuts.

645
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:06,240
Fucking drop it.

646
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:09,680
Then I think you got some traction.

647
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:12,720
Maybe a blackmailer.

648
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:20,560
Or could you start wearing paraphernalia from a competing brand?

649
00:28:20,560 --> 00:28:26,160
So you show up in a Diamond Nuts t-shirt and then she looks at you and she's like,

650
00:28:26,160 --> 00:28:29,520
well, I was about to tell you about Emerald Nuts, but apparently you-

651
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:31,040
Sorry, I'm affiliated.

652
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:32,320
Yeah, I'm already...

653
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:34,480
Yeah, I gave it the office.

654
00:28:35,040 --> 00:28:36,880
I already have my nut brand.

655
00:28:37,920 --> 00:28:38,960
I'm dyed in the wool.

656
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:39,760
Diamond for life.

657
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:41,920
Is there really a brand called Diamond Nuts?

658
00:28:41,920 --> 00:28:43,920
And also there's one called Emerald Nuts.

659
00:28:43,920 --> 00:28:46,640
Yeah, wait, yeah.

660
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:49,600
No, I think you're having a dream right now, but you're awake.

661
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:55,360
No, Diamond of California.

662
00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:58,240
They're the ones that have the little packages of nuts that you find in the cooking site.

663
00:28:58,240 --> 00:28:59,440
And then Emerald welled up?

664
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:00,880
What's a good name for a company?

665
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:02,320
How about Diamond Nuts?

666
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:03,680
Now they already did that one.

667
00:29:03,680 --> 00:29:04,560
Who got there first?

668
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:07,440
Planters was the OG, but-

669
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:09,200
Well, I mean, that's not a stone though.

670
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:12,000
Well, George Washington Carver probably had his own brand.

671
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,880
When he first popped one of those bad boys in his mouth, he was like, here we go.

672
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:15,520
He called them Ruby Nuts.

673
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:17,680
These are my Ruby Nuts.

674
00:29:17,680 --> 00:29:19,920
I can't believe I'm the first person to nosh on these nuts.

675
00:29:19,920 --> 00:29:20,960
These are amazing.

676
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:22,560
I'm George Washington Carver.

677
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:24,320
I invented eating a peanut.

678
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:28,480
Everyone assumed they were poisonous until this point.

679
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:30,400
And also the stoplight.

680
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:31,040
Fuck all y'all.

681
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:34,160
Should we go to the Money Zone?

682
00:29:34,160 --> 00:29:36,720
I mean, this whole fucking show is the Money Zone now, so-

683
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:40,080
Yeah, it's just a brand heavy cycle 2.0.

684
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:41,360
Let's take a Powerade break.

685
00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:43,600
Or we don't talk about Powerade for a minute.

686
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:43,840
Yeah.

687
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:46,800
That's what we mean by Powerade break.

688
00:29:46,800 --> 00:29:47,600
A power pause.

689
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:51,120
But just know that we're still thinking about it.

690
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:52,720
Yeah, we're still gonna be thinking about it.

691
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:55,760
Oh yeah, we're still gonna be sipping it in the background.

692
00:29:55,760 --> 00:30:08,320
If you need something to-

693
00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:10,000
What's the reverse of wash down?

694
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:10,480
Dry up?

695
00:30:13,280 --> 00:30:16,400
If you need something to dry up before you wash down Powerade,

696
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:18,640
make sure you reach for Nature Box Snacks.

697
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:24,000
This is a snack subscription service with wholesome stuff you can feel good about.

698
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:27,520
No colors, no sweeteners, no trans fats, no high fructose corn syrup.

699
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:31,600
Trust me, you're getting plenty of all those from Powerade.

700
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:35,120
They have some new snacks to tell you about.

701
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:37,600
I am going to add these to my list right away because they sound amazing.

702
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:38,800
Mini Belgian waffles.

703
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:39,040
Goddamn.

704
00:30:39,040 --> 00:30:39,520
What?

705
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:44,000
Drawberry lemonade fruit stars and sweet and salty nut medley.

706
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:47,760
Oh my god, the first movement of the sweet and salty nut medley.

707
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:49,360
Will bring a tear to your eye.

708
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:49,920
Spring.

709
00:30:49,920 --> 00:30:50,960
I think it's called Spring.

710
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:51,280
I think it's called Spring.

711
00:30:51,280 --> 00:30:51,840
Interpose.

712
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:56,400
If you want to try Nature Box and you should, if you haven't,

713
00:30:56,400 --> 00:30:58,720
you should go to naturebox.com slash my brother.

714
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:02,080
You can get a free trial of some of their favorite snacks.

715
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:04,160
If you have not done this yet, what do you wait?

716
00:31:04,160 --> 00:31:04,880
It's free.

717
00:31:05,680 --> 00:31:07,280
Just go get the free snacks.

718
00:31:07,280 --> 00:31:10,240
Maybe they were awaiting the arrival of mini Belgian waffles.

719
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:12,960
I don't know if those are going to be in the trial box.

720
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:14,720
I can't make any promises.

721
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:18,000
It is impossible to say, but maybe, I don't know,

722
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:21,200
maybe they were just waiting for something to make their mouth water.

723
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:23,760
And the very idea of there being little Belgium waffles

724
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:27,840
that don't have any fructose in them is just, that's enough.

725
00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:28,640
Look all through them.

726
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:29,600
Tear them apart.

727
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:30,640
Look in every inch of them.

728
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:32,560
You won't find a single bit of fructose in there.

729
00:31:32,560 --> 00:31:34,960
That address again is naturebox.com slash my brother.

730
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:37,440
Go get some of those free snacks.

731
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:41,520
Now in Powerade's electric lightning blue fructose stew,

732
00:31:41,520 --> 00:31:44,320
you're going to find a shit gaggle of fructose.

733
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:45,360
Holy shit.

734
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:49,040
It's like 98% fructose, 2% blue food coloring.

735
00:31:49,040 --> 00:31:52,160
I also want to tell you about Harry's.com or other sponsor this week.

736
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:55,680
Harry's is going to offer you a better shave.

737
00:31:55,680 --> 00:31:57,520
You may think you like shaving now.

738
00:31:57,520 --> 00:31:58,720
If you're not a Harry's customer,

739
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:01,200
you don't have any fucking idea what you're talking about.

740
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:04,720
Harry's razors give you a high quality shave that's better for your face,

741
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:06,640
but also your wallet.

742
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:09,280
You can get a starter set for 15 bucks.

743
00:32:09,280 --> 00:32:12,720
That includes a razor, foaming shave gel or shave cream.

744
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:14,080
I recommend the shave cream personally.

745
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:14,720
That's just me.

746
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:20,560
And three razor blades plus free shipping for $15.

747
00:32:20,560 --> 00:32:20,800
What?

748
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:22,240
Yeah, I know.

749
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:23,040
That's so good.

750
00:32:23,040 --> 00:32:25,440
What if I were to tell you I only have $10?

751
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:27,520
That's all the money I have in this world.

752
00:32:27,520 --> 00:32:28,320
Good news, Chaz.

753
00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:32,480
If you go to Harry's.com, you can get $5 off the starter set

754
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:34,400
with a code mybrother.

755
00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:35,280
That's all one word.

756
00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:38,480
Sorry, Jeff.

757
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:41,440
I was going to say it's good for men and women.

758
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:45,840
My former wife, now George Lopez's girlfriend, loves it.

759
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:47,760
So like, you should try it out.

760
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:49,360
I'm done.

761
00:32:49,360 --> 00:32:55,200
I'm tired of fishing my razor blades out of Powerade's laser blast razor slash,

762
00:32:55,200 --> 00:33:00,800
which is a red drink that is like drinking a child's volcano science fair project.

763
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:03,680
But with razors inside of it.

764
00:33:03,680 --> 00:33:06,640
I'm going to switch to this new service today.

765
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:10,000
Harry's.com, get $5 off the starter set with code mybrother.

766
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:10,960
That's all one word.

767
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:13,200
Start shaving better today.

768
00:33:13,920 --> 00:33:16,400
I also think, just Harry's, if you're listening,

769
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:18,800
maybe there's something there where you could do like,

770
00:33:18,800 --> 00:33:22,240
start shaving and start saving or something like that.

771
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:22,880
I don't know.

772
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:23,840
We'll workshop it.

773
00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:24,960
We'll figure it out for you.

774
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:25,680
Don't worry.

775
00:33:25,680 --> 00:33:27,360
That's one of the services we offer here.

776
00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:31,120
I have a message blast for Jonathan and Colleen,

777
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:33,600
the Northwest Embassy Ambassadors.

778
00:33:35,280 --> 00:33:36,880
Official titles.

779
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:40,880
These people are apparently the presidents of the Northwest.

780
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:43,600
The message is from Kristen and the Sally's.

781
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:45,040
Sally's.

782
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:47,920
This one's really tripping me up.

783
00:33:47,920 --> 00:33:49,840
These dog eyes of mine just can't read.

784
00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:53,920
The message is, here it comes.

785
00:33:54,560 --> 00:33:56,000
Lashley birthday haiku.

786
00:33:56,640 --> 00:33:58,320
Your birthdays have come.

787
00:33:58,320 --> 00:34:00,560
Your 20s almost over.

788
00:34:00,560 --> 00:34:01,760
Glad we can share them.

789
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:04,240
Is that our first haiku?

790
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:04,960
Is that our first?

791
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:08,080
There's no, what is it?

792
00:34:08,080 --> 00:34:09,920
There's no season words in here.

793
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:12,880
If you're gonna put in, if you're gonna do a haiku,

794
00:34:12,880 --> 00:34:15,120
I would have wanted a spring season word.

795
00:34:15,120 --> 00:34:16,960
A supple, throw that in there maybe.

796
00:34:18,160 --> 00:34:21,040
A brook, put that in there and then it would have been a proper.

797
00:34:21,040 --> 00:34:22,400
But I see you just haven't,

798
00:34:22,400 --> 00:34:25,440
you've chosen not to do this haiku in the Japanese style.

799
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:26,400
And I get it.

800
00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:28,240
That's fine.

801
00:34:28,240 --> 00:34:28,640
I get it.

802
00:34:28,640 --> 00:34:29,280
It's fine.

803
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:30,080
You're trying something new.

804
00:34:30,080 --> 00:34:33,200
This is sort of a transcontinental fusion.

805
00:34:33,200 --> 00:34:34,400
And I'm into it.

806
00:34:34,400 --> 00:34:36,960
I'm really into transcontinental fusion right now.

807
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:39,120
Anyway, happy birthday, Jonathan and Colleen.

808
00:34:39,120 --> 00:34:40,000
Congratulations.

809
00:34:40,640 --> 00:34:41,600
Do we have another one?

810
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:42,560
No.

811
00:34:43,200 --> 00:34:44,240
But we do.

812
00:34:44,240 --> 00:34:45,120
We do.

813
00:34:45,120 --> 00:34:45,680
Oh man.

814
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:48,800
It's over here behind the couch, Justin.

815
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:50,400
I was saving it for you.

816
00:34:50,400 --> 00:34:51,280
Fantastic.

817
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:54,000
This is a message for Kate from Christian.

818
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:56,800
Christian says, happy two year anniversary.

819
00:34:56,800 --> 00:34:59,040
Although we can't go on the amazing race,

820
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:01,120
I'm still excited to travel the world with you

821
00:35:01,120 --> 00:35:03,520
and have even more incredible adventures together.

822
00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:04,960
We make a great team.

823
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:06,400
Thank you for your support

824
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:08,000
and all the effort you put into

825
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:10,000
making this long distance thing work.

826
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:13,120
Also, I will beat you at Dominion someday.

827
00:35:13,120 --> 00:35:14,320
Love, Christian.

828
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:15,200
How sweet.

829
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:16,320
This is a sweet message.

830
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:20,320
Dominion's a hard game to pick up.

831
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:21,520
Is it a game?

832
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:22,320
Yeah, it's a board game.

833
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:23,280
Speaking of games,

834
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:24,640
should we talk about the amazing race

835
00:35:24,640 --> 00:35:26,320
just real quick for like 15 minutes?

836
00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:28,480
Sure, go ahead.

837
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:30,160
I've never watched an episode, but go for it.

838
00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:31,360
Here's what's up this season.

839
00:35:31,360 --> 00:35:35,200
They took six teams, all dating couples or married.

840
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:36,560
All couples, pre-existing.

841
00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:39,360
Other six teams, they done matched them up.

842
00:35:39,360 --> 00:35:41,360
They said, you and you, you're in love now

843
00:35:41,360 --> 00:35:42,480
and you're gonna travel the world

844
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:46,560
and you're gonna compete in wacky wet stunts and challenges

845
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:47,680
and it's gonna be amazing

846
00:35:47,680 --> 00:35:49,360
and all of you are gonna fall in love.

847
00:35:49,360 --> 00:35:51,200
And at every pit stop feels like,

848
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:52,720
so did y'all fall in love yet?

849
00:35:52,720 --> 00:35:55,760
And they're still like, no, stop asking.

850
00:35:55,760 --> 00:35:56,880
How much of a bummer is that?

851
00:35:56,880 --> 00:35:59,040
Or you just had to like stack up a bunch of watermelons

852
00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:00,080
and it took you six hours

853
00:36:00,080 --> 00:36:02,320
and you're really sweaty and really fucking frustrated.

854
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:04,960
But when you get to the pit stop, you barely eked it out.

855
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:06,560
Skinning your teeth, made it to the pit stop

856
00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:08,400
and feels like, so did you two kiss?

857
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:10,240
No, we haven't kissed.

858
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:11,680
We've been busy.

859
00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:16,000
We had to solve a goddamn word search

860
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,880
in the size of a city for you, you twisted fuck.

861
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:24,400
Somebody send this to amazing race.

862
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:26,000
And please let me be on the amazing race.

863
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:27,520
Holy shit, I'll do anything.

864
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:28,800
I don't care who you part.

865
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:30,800
Can we do a three man team on the amazing race?

866
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:31,440
Is that fair?

867
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:32,240
Is that allowed?

868
00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:33,520
Is that in the rules?

869
00:36:33,520 --> 00:36:37,200
We would not make it out of the parking lot.

870
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:38,640
They did one season.

871
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:39,760
Not the worst.

872
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:41,760
Did you guys hear they canceled the amazing race

873
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:43,280
because those three guys got killed?

874
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:44,560
Here's the weird thing.

875
00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:48,080
They were on their way to set to shoot the first episode.

876
00:36:48,080 --> 00:36:49,280
They're probably the worst.

877
00:36:49,840 --> 00:36:52,000
One tried to grab the wheel from the other one

878
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:53,920
and then the third one made a fart noise

879
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:55,040
and they all laughed so hard

880
00:36:55,040 --> 00:36:57,040
because they thought it was so fucking funny.

881
00:36:57,040 --> 00:36:58,320
And then one of them said boners

882
00:36:58,320 --> 00:36:59,760
and that really sent him in stitches.

883
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:01,760
And then they drove into a ravine.

884
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:03,840
But they were dead before they even crashed.

885
00:37:03,840 --> 00:37:05,600
That's probably from laughing too hard.

886
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:09,120
They were all eating like they're all sharing a churro

887
00:37:09,120 --> 00:37:11,120
and there might have been some like cinnamon dust

888
00:37:11,120 --> 00:37:13,280
go down their throats and they choked to death on it.

889
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:15,200
Here's the other thing about their car

890
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:18,480
was littered with Powerade containers.

891
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:19,920
Here's the weirdest thing.

892
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:22,720
They let the youngest one drive and he's a dog.

893
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:24,880
That's the thing.

894
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:26,480
That's our that's our hook.

895
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:28,800
We pretend Griffin, sorry, what?

896
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:29,520
No, that's me.

897
00:37:34,160 --> 00:37:35,440
I'm Cameron Esposito.

898
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:36,480
I'm Rhea Butcher.

899
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:37,680
I am Ricky Carmona.

900
00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:40,080
And we are the cast members, what?

901
00:37:40,080 --> 00:37:44,240
I don't know, podcastiness of Wham Bam Pow.

902
00:37:44,240 --> 00:37:47,120
That's an action sci-fi movie podcast

903
00:37:47,120 --> 00:37:50,080
you can find on maximumfun.org or on iTunes.

904
00:37:50,080 --> 00:37:51,280
And what do we do?

905
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:52,880
News reviews and things you can use.

906
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:54,000
Tons of things you can use.

907
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:57,440
We break it down so it can forever be broken.

908
00:37:57,440 --> 00:37:58,720
Hilarious jokes.

909
00:37:58,720 --> 00:38:00,320
Plus, sometimes there's a dog in the studio.

910
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:01,600
Sometimes there's a dog here.

911
00:38:01,600 --> 00:38:04,240
We'll see you in your earbuds.

912
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:13,040
Do you guys want a Yahoo?

913
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:14,160
Yeah, of course.

914
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:14,400
Yes.

915
00:38:15,120 --> 00:38:17,200
This Yahoo was sent in by Tom Harriman.

916
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:17,920
Thank you, Tom.

917
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:19,520
It's by Yahoo Answers user.

918
00:38:19,520 --> 00:38:23,040
Oh my god, something's gone wrong.

919
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:27,360
Rushus.

920
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:30,800
Rushus Primstein.

921
00:38:31,360 --> 00:38:33,520
Rushus Primstein asks,

922
00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:37,920
what is your favorite wizard swear?

923
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:46,800
What is your favorite wizard swear?

924
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:53,360
Is there any context to the question, Griffin?

925
00:38:53,360 --> 00:38:54,480
Of course not.

926
00:38:58,080 --> 00:39:00,960
Oh, I think I really like fuck.

927
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:06,240
Oh, fuck, my spell fucked up.

928
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:10,800
My fucking wand is broken.

929
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:12,640
Oh, my fucking wand again.

930
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:14,240
Where's my fucking cauldron?

931
00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:18,240
Fucking Snape's right in my ass.

932
00:39:18,240 --> 00:39:20,080
Fucking Snape's on my dick.

933
00:39:20,080 --> 00:39:20,480
God.

934
00:39:23,680 --> 00:39:25,440
Merlin's beard.

935
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:26,880
Fuck, it's hot in here.

936
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:30,960
Why do y'all have to wear these fucking robes?

937
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:33,040
Merlin's fucking beard.

938
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:36,320
Fucking hate this whole castle.

939
00:39:37,520 --> 00:39:42,320
Hey, Jimmy, can you fucking stop extinguishing the lights with your fucking smell?

940
00:39:42,320 --> 00:39:43,040
It sucks.

941
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:44,560
We're in a castle.

942
00:39:44,560 --> 00:39:45,920
It's fucking dark.

943
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:48,160
It's fucking dark all the time.

944
00:39:48,160 --> 00:39:49,200
Come on.

945
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:51,440
Oh, fucking dragon farts.

946
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:59,120
Get your fucking rat out of my bedroom.

947
00:39:59,120 --> 00:40:01,360
Zippity zappity fuckity doo.

948
00:40:03,360 --> 00:40:05,600
Why are wands so fucking thin?

949
00:40:05,600 --> 00:40:07,360
I break them every week.

950
00:40:07,360 --> 00:40:09,280
I hate this fucking job.

951
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:10,960
No, I don't want a fucking butterbeer.

952
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:12,720
Can I just get a Miller Highlight?

953
00:40:12,720 --> 00:40:13,360
Fuck.

954
00:40:13,360 --> 00:40:14,400
Jesus Christ.

955
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:19,040
No, the candy's alive.

956
00:40:19,040 --> 00:40:20,800
I bought a fucking chocolate frog.

957
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:22,320
I bought a frog.

958
00:40:22,320 --> 00:40:25,120
It's inside me moving the fuck around.

959
00:40:25,680 --> 00:40:28,560
All the pictures fucking move, it's creeping me the fuck out.

960
00:40:30,640 --> 00:40:32,160
I just want to go home.

961
00:40:32,160 --> 00:40:34,640
I ate a jelly bean and it was period.

962
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:37,200
I'm fucking out of Wizard Town.

963
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:39,760
I'm a guy now and I work at SitGo.

964
00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:43,120
You have tried seven fucking times to levitate yourself.

965
00:40:44,240 --> 00:40:48,640
Just get a fucking ladder and go up there and get the soda.

966
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:51,920
It's Wingardium fucking Leviosa, all right?

967
00:40:51,920 --> 00:40:53,920
How many fucking times do I-

968
00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:54,960
Muggle fucker.

969
00:40:56,560 --> 00:40:57,600
What are you fucking me?

970
00:40:57,600 --> 00:40:58,960
We don't even have ladders.

971
00:40:59,600 --> 00:41:01,440
I hate this fucking castle.

972
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:04,160
Buy a ladder that costs 15 fucking dollars.

973
00:41:06,240 --> 00:41:10,480
Generate one out of pure wishes or whatever the fuck you idiots do.

974
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:12,720
This ladder goes in six directions.

975
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:13,920
I don't- I want up.

976
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:15,440
Why the fuck would I want that?

977
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:16,800
The staircases move.

978
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:19,680
Well, that's poor fucking planning, isn't it?

979
00:41:19,680 --> 00:41:20,240
Isn't it?

980
00:41:20,240 --> 00:41:23,360
I could get on a staircase to somewhere and end up fucking somewhere else.

981
00:41:23,360 --> 00:41:27,680
What do you mean there's a giant dog upstairs guarding a fucking like trap door?

982
00:41:27,680 --> 00:41:29,680
I'm just trying to find the bathroom.

983
00:41:29,680 --> 00:41:30,720
I hate this place.

984
00:41:30,720 --> 00:41:34,240
I don't want to owl fucking next to my bed all night long.

985
00:41:34,240 --> 00:41:36,320
There's shit all over my nightstand.

986
00:41:36,320 --> 00:41:37,600
Are you gonna clean this up?

987
00:41:37,600 --> 00:41:39,600
He just fucking stares at me.

988
00:41:39,600 --> 00:41:42,640
There's a fucking wizarding war going on?

989
00:41:42,640 --> 00:41:44,800
I'm gonna go get my fucking GED.

990
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:46,080
This is ridiculous.

991
00:41:46,080 --> 00:41:46,720
Yes.

992
00:41:46,720 --> 00:41:47,760
Quick question.

993
00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:50,560
Nobody mentioned this to my fucking parents.

994
00:41:50,560 --> 00:41:57,040
When you put me on a train and ship me off here, there's a fucking every day my life would be under threat.

995
00:41:57,040 --> 00:41:58,160
I don't know magic.

996
00:41:58,800 --> 00:42:01,040
I'm just trying to learn some fucking potions.

997
00:42:01,040 --> 00:42:01,920
I don't know magic.

998
00:42:01,920 --> 00:42:05,040
How about for the first three years, you give me a gun?

999
00:42:07,040 --> 00:42:12,320
You give me a fucking gun so I can shoot the bad wizards when they're not looking.

1000
00:42:12,320 --> 00:42:13,360
How about that?

1001
00:42:13,360 --> 00:42:15,680
Because apparently you cannot protect me.

1002
00:42:15,680 --> 00:42:19,360
Half the people at this fucking school are evil and you don't know it.

1003
00:42:20,320 --> 00:42:20,720
What's that?

1004
00:42:20,720 --> 00:42:23,520
You guys don't don't play football either?

1005
00:42:23,520 --> 00:42:27,120
How am I supposed to ball 24-7 on the Quidditch court?

1006
00:42:27,120 --> 00:42:27,440
Fuck.

1007
00:42:27,440 --> 00:42:29,840
Oh, everything here wants to kill me.

1008
00:42:29,840 --> 00:42:34,640
There's like giant plants that want to kill me and like if I fall off my fucking broomstick,

1009
00:42:34,640 --> 00:42:37,200
I'm dead and people are fucking cursing me.

1010
00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:37,920
Okay, great.

1011
00:42:37,920 --> 00:42:40,080
In high school, I might get bullied.

1012
00:42:40,080 --> 00:42:41,360
Hate this place.

1013
00:42:41,360 --> 00:42:42,480
Hate this fucking school.

1014
00:42:42,480 --> 00:42:48,640
It's more like dog narts.

1015
00:42:48,640 --> 00:42:50,720
Nailed it.

1016
00:42:52,240 --> 00:42:52,720
Solid.

1017
00:42:53,680 --> 00:42:54,640
I have a question here.

1018
00:42:54,640 --> 00:42:59,600
I work in a cafe where customers frequently linger 30 to 40 minutes after we've closed.

1019
00:42:59,600 --> 00:43:03,680
I frequently find myself sweeping and mopping around them while they point it.

1020
00:43:03,680 --> 00:43:07,920
I thought that said moping at first and that is also yes.

1021
00:43:07,920 --> 00:43:14,720
And also that I find myself sweeping and mopping around them while they plainly ignore me and

1022
00:43:14,720 --> 00:43:15,680
keep chatting.

1023
00:43:15,680 --> 00:43:19,600
My boss does not allow us to directly tell them to leave.

1024
00:43:19,600 --> 00:43:22,640
What are some good passive aggressive ways to give them the boot?

1025
00:43:22,640 --> 00:43:24,560
And that's from I just want to fucking go home.

1026
00:43:24,560 --> 00:43:24,880
P.S.

1027
00:43:24,880 --> 00:43:26,880
The song Closing Time is not on our storage playlist.

1028
00:43:26,880 --> 00:43:29,200
That was literally on the tip of my tongue.

1029
00:43:29,200 --> 00:43:29,440
Shit.

1030
00:43:30,240 --> 00:43:31,040
Here's what you do.

1031
00:43:31,920 --> 00:43:32,880
Sing Closing Time.

1032
00:43:32,880 --> 00:43:34,640
Do just an acoustic cover right there on the spot.

1033
00:43:34,640 --> 00:43:38,720
An acoustic cover of Closing Time you walk right up to and you say, hey, hey guys.

1034
00:43:38,720 --> 00:43:40,960
Where are the cool parties this weekend?

1035
00:43:40,960 --> 00:43:45,920
And then just keep asking them about cool parties this weekend until they decide to

1036
00:43:45,920 --> 00:43:46,800
leave because that no one wants to hang out.

1037
00:43:46,800 --> 00:43:48,160
What do you guys watch on Hulu?

1038
00:43:48,720 --> 00:43:51,200
Hey, have you guys watched anything on Hulu lately?

1039
00:43:52,800 --> 00:43:54,080
Tell me about what you're watching.

1040
00:43:54,080 --> 00:43:55,040
What are you watching?

1041
00:43:55,040 --> 00:43:55,360
Huh?

1042
00:43:55,360 --> 00:43:58,240
You checked out that what that Galavant?

1043
00:43:58,240 --> 00:43:59,040
That's a good one.

1044
00:43:59,040 --> 00:44:00,960
Hey, have you guys seen Arrow?

1045
00:44:00,960 --> 00:44:03,840
Hey, who wants to talk about Arrow?

1046
00:44:05,200 --> 00:44:09,520
Hey, I go up to them and just keep at look.

1047
00:44:09,520 --> 00:44:10,960
You get to introduce it like this.

1048
00:44:10,960 --> 00:44:13,200
Hey guys, we're starting to close up.

1049
00:44:13,200 --> 00:44:15,360
Just wondering if you needed anything, right?

1050
00:44:15,360 --> 00:44:19,600
And then you're going to ask them if they need anything like once every minute.

1051
00:44:20,560 --> 00:44:21,760
Just keep walking by going.

1052
00:44:21,760 --> 00:44:22,720
You guys still good?

1053
00:44:22,720 --> 00:44:23,520
Do you need anything?

1054
00:44:23,520 --> 00:44:24,560
OK, great.

1055
00:44:24,560 --> 00:44:26,720
The real answer is just to unplug the router.

1056
00:44:27,760 --> 00:44:28,080
Right?

1057
00:44:28,080 --> 00:44:31,120
10 PM rolls around, unplug the fucking router.

1058
00:44:31,120 --> 00:44:34,720
And they turn into ash and blow out the front door.

1059
00:44:34,720 --> 00:44:35,680
Whoosh, there they go.

1060
00:44:37,440 --> 00:44:42,720
Or you could say at 10.01, put up a sign that says at 10.01,

1061
00:44:42,720 --> 00:44:46,720
I will be loudly reciting some of my favorite bits from the Big Bang Theory

1062
00:44:46,720 --> 00:44:48,160
in the middle of the room.

1063
00:44:48,160 --> 00:44:49,360
And then 10.01 rolls around.

1064
00:44:49,360 --> 00:44:51,600
You go out the first time and just like, hey, everybody, Bazinga.

1065
00:44:51,600 --> 00:44:52,240
It's great to see you.

1066
00:44:53,120 --> 00:44:54,880
And then Sheldon says.

1067
00:44:54,880 --> 00:44:56,000
Then Sheldon's like.

1068
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:57,520
And oh, and here's what you have to know about it.

1069
00:44:57,520 --> 00:44:59,040
Oh, so they like live together.

1070
00:44:59,040 --> 00:44:59,520
They're roommates.

1071
00:44:59,520 --> 00:45:00,560
Have you guys seen the show?

1072
00:45:00,560 --> 00:45:04,080
OK, so imagine it's two kind of awkward dudes, right?

1073
00:45:04,080 --> 00:45:04,880
I like math.

1074
00:45:04,880 --> 00:45:06,000
I prefer science.

1075
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:09,280
Bazinga, Bazinga, Bazinga, and Bazinga to you.

1076
00:45:11,040 --> 00:45:11,600
Are you wearing a flash costume?

1077
00:45:11,600 --> 00:45:12,640
Have you heard the good news?

1078
00:45:13,520 --> 00:45:15,120
Are you wearing a flash costume?

1079
00:45:15,120 --> 00:45:16,640
Yes, I do it every episode.

1080
00:45:16,640 --> 00:45:18,720
If only I could math love.

1081
00:45:21,760 --> 00:45:25,440
If only love was something I could calculate with my science calculator.

1082
00:45:25,440 --> 00:45:27,920
Bazinga.

1083
00:45:27,920 --> 00:45:28,960
Bazinga, my brother.

1084
00:45:30,080 --> 00:45:35,520
Where did you find the DVD for a poorly translated Big Bang Theory?

1085
00:45:35,520 --> 00:45:37,600
And Bazinga is the plural of Bazinga.

1086
00:45:38,160 --> 00:45:38,960
Everybody knows that.

1087
00:45:38,960 --> 00:45:39,440
No, I'm sorry.

1088
00:45:39,440 --> 00:45:40,800
It is a murder of Bazinga.

1089
00:45:42,240 --> 00:45:42,800
I wish.

1090
00:45:42,800 --> 00:45:44,240
Oh, God, if only.

1091
00:45:44,240 --> 00:45:45,040
If only.

1092
00:45:45,040 --> 00:45:46,720
Shonda Rhimes wrote that episode.

1093
00:45:46,720 --> 00:45:49,680
Shonda Rhimes wrote the bomb episode of Big Bang Theory.

1094
00:45:49,680 --> 00:45:50,240
Just kidding.

1095
00:45:50,240 --> 00:45:51,040
They're all bombs.

1096
00:45:51,040 --> 00:45:51,840
Y'all want to Yahoo?

1097
00:45:52,640 --> 00:45:52,880
Yeah.

1098
00:45:53,520 --> 00:45:54,560
Drop the bomb, Chaz.

1099
00:45:54,560 --> 00:45:59,360
This Yajuru was sent in by Level 9000 Yajuru Shaman Drew Davenport.

1100
00:45:59,360 --> 00:45:59,920
Thank you, Drew.

1101
00:45:59,920 --> 00:46:03,600
It's by Yajuru Answers user, Blaze, who asks.

1102
00:46:05,040 --> 00:46:08,160
My name is Blaze Props.

1103
00:46:09,600 --> 00:46:11,680
I'm 15 and a male.

1104
00:46:12,720 --> 00:46:18,480
I wanted to know if anyone knew of a better, more professional name for Blaze.

1105
00:46:20,640 --> 00:46:23,360
I've gone through my entire life with people asking me,

1106
00:46:23,360 --> 00:46:24,800
what's wrong with my parents?

1107
00:46:24,800 --> 00:46:26,320
Or are your parents potheads?

1108
00:46:26,320 --> 00:46:27,760
Or do you smoke weed?

1109
00:46:27,760 --> 00:46:28,800
Of course I smoke weed.

1110
00:46:28,800 --> 00:46:31,360
I mean, my name is fucking Blaze, LMAO.

1111
00:46:32,560 --> 00:46:32,880
What?

1112
00:46:34,400 --> 00:46:36,640
Blaze literally don't understand the question.

1113
00:46:36,640 --> 00:46:39,760
He's looking for a better, more professional name.

1114
00:46:39,760 --> 00:46:40,640
He's rebranding.

1115
00:46:41,520 --> 00:46:42,320
Maybe Blaz?

1116
00:46:42,880 --> 00:46:44,000
I don't know.

1117
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:44,880
That's nothing.

1118
00:46:44,880 --> 00:46:45,840
How about Blazze?

1119
00:46:46,880 --> 00:46:48,560
That doesn't seem professional, though, does it?

1120
00:46:48,560 --> 00:46:50,160
It seems like you're not going to take this job very seriously.

1121
00:46:50,160 --> 00:46:52,080
Yeah, it definitely seems like he doesn't care.

1122
00:46:52,080 --> 00:46:57,600
So he's 15 and he's looking for a more professional, like,

1123
00:46:57,600 --> 00:46:59,120
like nom de plume, I guess.

1124
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:03,520
I think he's looking for, like, a mutated version of his name.

1125
00:47:03,520 --> 00:47:06,640
Kind of like how, like, Charles can turn into Chuck,

1126
00:47:06,640 --> 00:47:09,120
even though those only have, like, two goddamn letters in common.

1127
00:47:09,920 --> 00:47:12,320
I'm looking for Bill.

1128
00:47:12,320 --> 00:47:13,600
He could go by Blade.

1129
00:47:14,560 --> 00:47:18,960
Well, I don't think that's going to be much better.

1130
00:47:18,960 --> 00:47:22,240
Nobody's going to ask if your parents smoke weed if your name's Blade.

1131
00:47:22,240 --> 00:47:24,000
They might ask if you kill vampires.

1132
00:47:24,560 --> 00:47:26,960
And then you're like, yeah, of course I kill vampires.

1133
00:47:26,960 --> 00:47:30,240
My name's Blade, L-L-O-M-O, whatever he said.

1134
00:47:31,280 --> 00:47:32,800
L-F-O, that's right, Travis.

1135
00:47:32,800 --> 00:47:35,120
What if he said, my name is Blazer?

1136
00:47:35,120 --> 00:47:37,520
And then that seems more powerful to me.

1137
00:47:37,520 --> 00:47:40,480
And it's like an active verb, you know?

1138
00:47:40,480 --> 00:47:44,080
Yeah, and that could mean, like, he is one who blazes.

1139
00:47:44,080 --> 00:47:47,280
Or he's wearing a professional-looking sport jacket.

1140
00:47:47,280 --> 00:47:48,080
Exactly.

1141
00:47:48,080 --> 00:47:49,440
That's exactly what I'm saying.

1142
00:47:49,440 --> 00:47:50,480
My name is Blazer.

1143
00:47:50,480 --> 00:47:51,680
This is my dog.

1144
00:47:51,680 --> 00:47:52,320
Necktie.

1145
00:47:52,320 --> 00:47:54,000
I brought him into this job interview.

1146
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:55,200
I'm 15 years old.

1147
00:47:55,200 --> 00:47:55,600
What's that?

1148
00:47:55,600 --> 00:47:57,200
I can't work yet.

1149
00:47:57,200 --> 00:47:57,920
Ah, shit.

1150
00:47:57,920 --> 00:47:58,400
What's that?

1151
00:47:58,400 --> 00:47:59,280
I need to leave?

1152
00:47:59,280 --> 00:47:59,680
Okay.

1153
00:47:59,680 --> 00:48:01,040
Thank you very much for your time.

1154
00:48:01,040 --> 00:48:04,880
No matter what, if doing a comedy podcast has taught me anything,

1155
00:48:05,520 --> 00:48:09,440
no matter what your last name is, people will find a way to tie it to weed.

1156
00:48:11,120 --> 00:48:13,120
Look at poor Humphrey Bogart.

1157
00:48:13,120 --> 00:48:16,720
He thought he could make it through life that way, but nope, every single time.

1158
00:48:16,720 --> 00:48:18,400
Hi, I'm Humphrey Bogart.

1159
00:48:18,400 --> 00:48:21,600
Ah, well, make sure you pass it when I'm around.

1160
00:48:21,600 --> 00:48:23,600
Or look at those poor Doobie brothers.

1161
00:48:23,600 --> 00:48:25,440
No, look at the poor Doobie brothers.

1162
00:48:25,440 --> 00:48:30,720
Can I just say, I do not think that's a problem that Humphrey Bogart, Humphrey Bogart?

1163
00:48:30,720 --> 00:48:32,320
Humphrey Bogart suffers from.

1164
00:48:32,880 --> 00:48:35,680
I, I, well, not anymore.

1165
00:48:35,680 --> 00:48:40,000
But can you imagine how bad of a weed sharer you have to be

1166
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:43,840
for people to name the act of not sharing weed after you?

1167
00:48:43,840 --> 00:48:47,600
Well, Humphrey Bogart was notoriously bad at sharing.

1168
00:48:47,600 --> 00:48:49,360
Apparently, just weed though.

1169
00:48:49,360 --> 00:48:51,360
Anything else, he'd give me the shirt off his back

1170
00:48:51,360 --> 00:48:54,000
unless he had some weed in the pocket of his shirt,

1171
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:56,960
in which case he would keep it on and smoke all of it in front of you.

1172
00:48:56,960 --> 00:48:59,840
Is there an opposite of Bogart?

1173
00:48:59,840 --> 00:49:02,480
Which means somebody that is constantly giving out free weed,

1174
00:49:02,480 --> 00:49:05,520
and if not, I would like to nominate my old roommate, Eric.

1175
00:49:07,600 --> 00:49:10,400
Wait, so you would say like, thank you for Eric-ing that weed?

1176
00:49:11,440 --> 00:49:13,280
It doesn't roll off the tongue, really.

1177
00:49:13,280 --> 00:49:14,720
Bro, you really Eric-ed me.

1178
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:17,200
But that's a good thing.

1179
00:49:17,200 --> 00:49:18,080
It doesn't, I know.

1180
00:49:18,640 --> 00:49:19,600
It's a celebration.

1181
00:49:19,600 --> 00:49:20,080
I'm saying, I'm...

1182
00:49:20,880 --> 00:49:22,320
What if they, okay, okay.

1183
00:49:22,320 --> 00:49:24,960
Maybe Eric-ing is you force, you force them to, hey.

1184
00:49:24,960 --> 00:49:25,760
No, no, no, no.

1185
00:49:25,760 --> 00:49:26,560
Come on, you Eric-ed me.

1186
00:49:26,560 --> 00:49:28,320
I got a drug test tomorrow.

1187
00:49:28,320 --> 00:49:30,560
No, Eric, Eric would never do that.

1188
00:49:30,560 --> 00:49:32,880
He would just, it was always there if you needed it.

1189
00:49:32,880 --> 00:49:34,320
I'm not saying it sounds the best.

1190
00:49:34,320 --> 00:49:36,480
I'm saying we could definitely find better words for it.

1191
00:49:36,480 --> 00:49:39,040
But this, I mean, the shoe fits.

1192
00:49:39,040 --> 00:49:43,600
What about broguard?

1193
00:49:43,600 --> 00:49:46,160
Well, that might get confusing when someone has to, I'm sorry.

1194
00:49:46,800 --> 00:49:48,720
Did you say I was broguarding it or broguarding it?

1195
00:49:48,720 --> 00:49:49,440
Broguarding it.

1196
00:49:50,960 --> 00:49:52,960
I think you could figure that out from context clues.

1197
00:49:52,960 --> 00:49:55,040
Look in your heart.

1198
00:49:55,040 --> 00:49:55,760
What do you think?

1199
00:49:55,760 --> 00:49:56,720
How do you feel you're doing?

1200
00:50:00,560 --> 00:50:03,760
Hey, thanks everybody for listening to our comedy podcast,

1201
00:50:04,320 --> 00:50:05,840
My Brother, My Brother, and Me.

1202
00:50:05,840 --> 00:50:12,720
Uh, right now, before we do any of our other, uh, let me horseshit, uh, we want to remind you that

1203
00:50:12,720 --> 00:50:15,360
we're going to be coming to the Pacific Northwest and we want to see you there.

1204
00:50:15,360 --> 00:50:16,400
We're doing a show in Portland.

1205
00:50:16,400 --> 00:50:17,120
That's sold out.

1206
00:50:17,120 --> 00:50:21,920
But if you're near Portland, you can come to our show in Seattle, which is just a,

1207
00:50:21,920 --> 00:50:23,040
it's just a short drive away.

1208
00:50:23,040 --> 00:50:24,400
We're making the drive.

1209
00:50:24,400 --> 00:50:25,520
I don't see why you can't.

1210
00:50:25,520 --> 00:50:30,000
That's mb, bit.ly forward slash mb mb am Seattle.

1211
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:35,280
We're also going to, uh, the night after that, which will be August 30th, the 29th,

1212
00:50:35,280 --> 00:50:37,920
the 29th on Saturday is, uh, Seattle.

1213
00:50:37,920 --> 00:50:41,680
That's actually the Saturday night of PAX, if prime, if you're going to be around for that,

1214
00:50:41,680 --> 00:50:43,520
uh, you should come to our show.

1215
00:50:43,520 --> 00:50:46,960
Uh, and also the night after that, August 30th, we're going to be in Vancouver.

1216
00:50:46,960 --> 00:50:52,080
That's bit.ly van mb mb am to buy tickets.

1217
00:50:52,080 --> 00:50:54,640
It's our first international show.

1218
00:50:54,640 --> 00:50:56,720
It's going to get crazy.

1219
00:50:56,720 --> 00:50:58,720
We're going to exchange money.

1220
00:50:58,720 --> 00:51:00,880
We're going to show our passports.

1221
00:51:00,880 --> 00:51:02,160
It's going to be wild.

1222
00:51:02,160 --> 00:51:04,080
My baby's never left the nation before.

1223
00:51:04,080 --> 00:51:06,000
So it'll be our first time in a foreign land.

1224
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:07,600
Hopefully they let her.

1225
00:51:07,600 --> 00:51:07,920
Yeah.

1226
00:51:07,920 --> 00:51:12,400
The focus group is like, y'all got to get out of America and test the international

1227
00:51:12,400 --> 00:51:13,520
waters out there.

1228
00:51:13,520 --> 00:51:18,800
And I said, okay, but it has to be walking distance back to America.

1229
00:51:18,800 --> 00:51:25,040
One thing that I would say is that the seating for, uh, the Seattle and Vancouver shows are

1230
00:51:25,040 --> 00:51:26,160
reserved seating.

1231
00:51:26,160 --> 00:51:31,680
But right now, if you act fast, you can reserve a box at the Vancouver show.

1232
00:51:31,680 --> 00:51:36,160
How cool would you be if you had like a formal box?

1233
00:51:36,160 --> 00:51:38,880
And listen, if you're in a box, I'm going to be playing to the boxes.

1234
00:51:38,880 --> 00:51:40,000
You don't need to worry about that.

1235
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:41,360
You're going to be my dog pound.

1236
00:51:41,360 --> 00:51:44,720
I want to be, I'm going to be a lot of material just for the boxes.

1237
00:51:45,920 --> 00:51:47,200
A lot of three pointers.

1238
00:51:47,200 --> 00:51:47,920
A lot of three pointers.

1239
00:51:47,920 --> 00:51:51,200
We'll wear hats with stuff on top of the hats that only you'll be able to see.

1240
00:51:52,160 --> 00:51:53,440
A lot of deep buckets.

1241
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:58,720
I want to just take a second to thank nature box.

1242
00:51:58,720 --> 00:52:03,040

00:52:15,040 --> 00:52:17,840
It's a departure off the album, putting the days to bed.

1248
00:52:17,840 --> 00:52:18,640
