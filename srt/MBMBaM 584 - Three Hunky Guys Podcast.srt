1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,820
The McElroy brothers are not experts and their advice should never be followed

2
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:10,580
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it

3
00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:17,660
Also, this show isn't for kids which I mentioned only so the babies out there will know how cool they are for listening

4
00:00:17,660 --> 00:00:30,660
What's up, you cool, baby?

5
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:50,300
It's better it's better with you

6
00:00:53,980 --> 00:00:56,060
It's better it's better with you

7
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:02,300
Better it's better

8
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:15,940
Hello everybody and welcome to my brother my brother me and it's an advice show for the margin era

9
00:01:15,940 --> 00:01:21,860
I'm your oldest brother Justin McElroy. I'm your middlest brother Travis McElroy. Yep. I'm your sweet, baby, brother

10
00:01:23,780 --> 00:01:25,780
Okay

11
00:01:27,700 --> 00:01:33,300
Now that we finally hit the year and we've actually in a year about a dog with no bones

12
00:01:33,300 --> 00:01:39,580
We really fucking nailed it and I dare I go forget. Okay, that's okay, but you can never say it again that era

13
00:01:41,060 --> 00:01:44,900
Yeah, so I was listening to and listen, I don't want to promote

14
00:01:44,900 --> 00:01:51,140
On another podcast because as everyone knows all comp podcasts are competing all the time. That's right. We'll call it

15
00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:56,460
Schmid schmize on yeah, shmed gum with Schmoner

16
00:01:56,940 --> 00:01:58,820
Schmattliff, right?

17
00:01:58,820 --> 00:02:00,820
That is actually inscrutable

18
00:02:00,820 --> 00:02:04,300
Yeah, even if somebody who knows what you're talking about. Yeah, it's the podcast dead eyes

19
00:02:04,300 --> 00:02:11,700
And there was an episode where they talked about like child actors, right who had played younger versions of Tom Hanks

20
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:18,420
Oh, and it got me thinking that a lot of people talk about like if they made a movie about your life who would play you

21
00:02:18,420 --> 00:02:26,380
And people always think about like younger actors or like actors their same age, but I want to ask you guys because I think

22
00:02:27,540 --> 00:02:32,540
The next move the next big step in like biopic or biopic

23
00:02:33,220 --> 00:02:36,860
Movies used to make movies about people who are still alive

24
00:02:36,860 --> 00:02:42,940
But what we think they're gonna do when they get older, right? So kind of a future

25
00:02:42,940 --> 00:02:44,700
You should know nonfiction. Yes

26
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:51,140
And so who would you want to play you as an older like if they made a movie about you right now?

27
00:02:51,700 --> 00:02:57,100
Yeah, like 75 looking about all the awesome shit you did in the next like 40 years, right?

28
00:02:57,100 --> 00:03:02,180
Who were irritated by the fact that this has come like it's actually a pretty good idea. Hey, thank you

29
00:03:02,180 --> 00:03:08,260
It's like just but I don't think it I always get like I feel like there's a level of idea

30
00:03:08,260 --> 00:03:13,180
That's like podcast good. You know what I mean? Where it's like we can just kind of dump it out here

31
00:03:15,740 --> 00:03:19,700
Moving car. Yeah, I mean it's gotta be Kirk Cameron Wow

32
00:03:20,980 --> 00:03:28,700
Controversial pit Griffin. I don't know. No, I don't like the guy. Oh, yeah, I find I find love them. I love it

33
00:03:28,700 --> 00:03:34,900
It's so funny. Yeah, you look at it and you're like, yeah, sure Griffin. He was funny and growing pains

34
00:03:34,900 --> 00:03:36,900
It's like no this dude says

35
00:03:37,220 --> 00:03:44,700
Really funny shit all the time. Yeah, he's Andy Kaufman level s committed to this weird character. He's been playing so into it

36
00:03:46,380 --> 00:03:50,940
Even his even his sister Candace Karen's like anyway, you guys know my dumb shit, bro

37
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:55,060
She's also kind of in on the joke though, huh a little bit

38
00:03:55,060 --> 00:04:00,460
She's a little bit see I was thinking for me and maybe this is just wishful thinking

39
00:04:00,580 --> 00:04:02,940
But I really think he and I share the same energy

40
00:04:02,940 --> 00:04:08,260
I'm just gonna say Brian Cox because I think when you see Brian Cox you think like that's an old Travis McElroy

41
00:04:08,260 --> 00:04:11,220
but like I said, maybe that's wishful thinking and and

42
00:04:11,900 --> 00:04:15,140
It's probably not that is that no, it's probably no

43
00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:21,820
Fishers might be a good Travis. Here's the thing with this Travis is I could say literally anything

44
00:04:21,820 --> 00:04:26,480
I could say literally anyone because who the fuck knows what I'm gonna get up to in 40 years

45
00:04:26,860 --> 00:04:31,760
Well, but at this point Griffin, I mean you're what you're 34 at this point

46
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:32,500
Yeah

47
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:39,380
And so I think you have you can look at yourself at like 12 and see the progression of 22 years

48
00:04:39,380 --> 00:04:42,540
So I think you could right now say like I think at 56

49
00:04:42,620 --> 00:04:46,940
We've aged your baby to an adult and this is what we think he'll look like kind of thing

50
00:04:46,940 --> 00:04:52,140
You know what? I mean? Yeah, so I think you can probably extrapolate where you're gonna be. Um

51
00:04:53,060 --> 00:04:56,060
No, I don't think so, but I think her camera is a good start

52
00:04:56,860 --> 00:04:58,860
Okay, bold a bold choice

53
00:04:59,740 --> 00:05:01,580
Justin

54
00:05:01,580 --> 00:05:03,580
hmm a

55
00:05:03,860 --> 00:05:09,300
Justin McElroy type I'm trying to figure out who's got like the heat Justin McElroy

56
00:05:10,620 --> 00:05:12,620
Energy, you know, yeah

57
00:05:12,620 --> 00:05:16,580
Who's like my like it's sort of like I mean

58
00:05:18,100 --> 00:05:21,380
Who's like got a Justin like who's got like a genuine

59
00:05:22,140 --> 00:05:26,940
Like I feel everybody's saying Dev Patel. Yeah, I could Justin McElroy

60
00:05:27,580 --> 00:05:29,580
Energy that the I'm not sure

61
00:05:30,060 --> 00:05:32,060
sexuality handsomeness

62
00:05:32,980 --> 00:05:35,100
Tell sir like

63
00:05:36,100 --> 00:05:38,100
Sort of like a Dev Patel

64
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:43,180
I mean, there is one problem Justin. I'm not sure he's older than you

65
00:05:43,180 --> 00:05:49,660
I think that's the one issue that I'm having with that passing Travis. He is an actor

66
00:05:51,220 --> 00:05:52,660
So

67
00:05:52,660 --> 00:05:54,660
Now Justin

68
00:05:54,940 --> 00:05:58,100
Like body. Yeah, like more of a

69
00:05:58,740 --> 00:06:01,860
Camille body with like a Dev Patel face. Yeah

70
00:06:02,460 --> 00:06:06,340
Sexuality and chemistry and like a handsomeness and stuff and now Justin I'm just gonna throw this out

71
00:06:06,340 --> 00:06:08,340
This is a bit of a different

72
00:06:08,540 --> 00:06:14,100
Direction than Dev Patel, but you know if we could get Streep that almost guarantees an Oscar

73
00:06:14,460 --> 00:06:17,660
You know what? I mean get that Oscar buzz going if we could get Streep

74
00:06:18,460 --> 00:06:19,940
Yeah

75
00:06:19,940 --> 00:06:25,940
It would be great if what a challenge for her. I know what a yeah, what a departure, you know

76
00:06:26,260 --> 00:06:31,260
Street if you want to do something that's gonna get people talking, you know, yeah

77
00:06:31,260 --> 00:06:39,140
Yeah, because you'll have to really dig deep to find the charisma within her to match your energy, right?

78
00:06:39,140 --> 00:06:40,140
Well, yeah

79
00:06:40,140 --> 00:06:46,700
Dev Patel level energy and sexuality with us do like what was that? Um, what was the

80
00:06:47,980 --> 00:06:52,220
Bob Dylan movie where like they hadn't multiple actors play him we could do

81
00:06:53,460 --> 00:06:59,240
Wonder Emporium exactly the magical boat of dr. Parnassus exactly

82
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:01,840
Very exact kind of thing because it's just called Dr. Who?

83
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:05,400
No, I think it's called the sky captain in the world of tomorrow

84
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:10,600
But I think we could get because I would like to see I here's here's the lineup

85
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:13,560
I think you go Glenn Close then you go Streep

86
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:20,320
Then you go Glenn Close and Streep together like true west and how you like trade it off and then you go a Dev Patel

87
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:22,320
And then you're gonna bring it back

88
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:27,320
Like who's a hot child star right now, you know, we're gonna have like a way

89
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:29,040
Yeah, Nicky

90
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:32,320
Yeah, Nicky in there. Maybe a Timmy TimothÃ©e Chalamet

91
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:37,640
We get all of them in and they yeah, but here's the thing they're all talking to each other

92
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:41,120
It's all just it's oops. I'll just it's all Justin's that's cool. That's cool

93
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:45,800
What would be really cool is if in 40 years the thing Justin's best known for is not these podcasts

94
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:47,960
but that like I don't know he invents a

95
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:54,520
Hat that smells good. So when you come out of the bathroom, you don't have a bathroom smell behind you

96
00:07:54,520 --> 00:08:00,840
You were you were like your good-smelling bathroom hat and then you get Glenn Close out there like it's my bathroom hat

97
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:06,720
Yeah, like is that actually Justin or I'm confused. Is this one of those CGI things?

98
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:13,800
What what is hard is like the best chance I have of being depicted in the film at this point. Yeah

99
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:17,840
Is if somebody does a berries and cream movie?

100
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:22,960
Okay, that's my best shot to get into a movie

101
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:27,120
I feel like I just a macro character into a movie like

102
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:33,440
Okay. See for me. I think the best hope of getting a Travis macro biopic is probably some kind of

103
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:40,080
whimsical but definitely still like fairly serious crime spree where it's just like

104
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:44,180
Where people are trying to understand like where it all went wrong kind of thing

105
00:08:44,180 --> 00:08:51,480
But also I have a certain charisma much like you know that movie where it would they were Robin Banks

106
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:56,800
But everybody seemed to like him a lot, you know that one. Oh sure sure. Yeah with that jazz

107
00:08:57,560 --> 00:09:00,760
Bruno yeah. Yeah, I would I

108
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:08,840
Feel like there's also a decent chance. I might be very briefly depicted in if they did rocket boys again

109
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:13,360
yeah, the West Virginia guys that did Rockets if they didn't run boys again and

110
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:20,200
At the end they wanted to be like and there's still people in West Virginia today. It was just like me going. Oh, yeah

111
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:22,140
Yeah, yeah. Yeah, I'm here, too

112
00:09:22,140 --> 00:09:25,680
there's actually a very good chance, you know in that there will be a

113
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:30,780
biopic of like Lynn that we might be depicted in and if that happens and

114
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:36,180
Lynn you're like you have any voice in it, please make sure it's just three really ripped dudes

115
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:39,360
fully jacked

116
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:43,760
Like six foot eight like hunks, you know what I mean?

117
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:46,280
Right because you want it to be accurate

118
00:09:46,280 --> 00:09:52,560
Hunky hunky guys, we're three hunky guys and we do a podcast together. What kind of podcast you ask?

119
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:58,000
Well, it's weird that you just started listening sight unseen, but like hey good. Appreciate it

120
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:02,140
Maybe it was just on maybe somebody's sitting in the tired disc counters like waiting room right now

121
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:04,880
It's playing

122
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:14,360
From the view to our podcast. Yeah, it's streaming to their television or something. Well device. It's an advice shit

123
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:16,960
Why isn't there a podcast channel? Come on

124
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:20,960
Come on

125
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:27,320
There's lots of channels, you know, yeah, right almost too many sometimes it's scrolling through there and I'm like, what's what's all this?

126
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:31,360
There's like eight a trio's, you know the chills. I like on TV

127
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:34,840
I don't have them anywhere. I don't think or at least I is a music choice

128
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:38,240
Oh, I like that. There's it where your TV's like I could play music

129
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:44,440
It's like I know yeah, can you can you play whatever song I want? Oh, no, I can come match up

130
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:48,880
I don't want to feel like some Weather Channel jazz. Yeah. Yeah, actually I do

131
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:52,680
But without all the trouble of the weather being there also. Yeah

132
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:54,400
I

133
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:56,800
Work for the u.s. Snowboard team. Hell, yeah

134
00:10:57,520 --> 00:11:03,500
My role in short is to use wax to make the boards go fast like in Christmas vacation

135
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:08,380
Oh for sure. So you know the main way. Yes is a non-nutrient varnish. Yeah

136
00:11:08,900 --> 00:11:12,480
My job is inherently nerdy and I'm sounds cool to me

137
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:22,080
If that's if that's nerdy then I'm I'm a hundred I'm a thousand percent that minkus. Yeah, I just got a

138
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:30,640
My job is inherently nerdy and I am spending time with a lot of rad athletes who do rad stunts

139
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:36,520
I don't like dangerous stunts. How do we come rad? That's from Paul and st. Paul. Well, that's a good hook

140
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:44,840
Yeah, yeah, right there. I think when I first read this question what hit me Paul if I may I think that you have one a

141
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:51,120
Fundamental misunderstanding of what is rad. Yeah, but your view has been skewed

142
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:55,000
Yes, but you got too close like Icarus, you know

143
00:11:55,000 --> 00:12:01,000
I mean like you got too close to to true coolness and you've kind of lost perspective a little bit, right?

144
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,960
Yeah, right, right, right, right, right, right

145
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:10,280
Like this is like I bet that there are top level like high school varsity baseball players that like look at

146
00:12:10,280 --> 00:12:13,040
You know people in the MLB and they're like, I'll never be that

147
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:19,960
Well here I am looking at you varsity player thinking I'll never be that so don't you worry about it?

148
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:27,040
But I I also think Paul well, you have to understand is these snowboarders. This is their day-to-day, right?

149
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:31,320
They're they're so used to doing dangerous stunts and seeing other people do dangerous stunts

150
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:33,480
I don't think that counts as rad to them anymore

151
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:40,380
But when you start talking about this cool board wax that you use and how the science works on it

152
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:45,960
that's what's gonna blow them away they then that's what's going to be impressive to them or

153
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:51,840
You're gonna have to get good at rad stunts. It's one of those two. I don't you don't want to do that

154
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:55,800
Um, that's not rad to them. What you know, I mean, you know

155
00:12:56,080 --> 00:13:01,280
If I could suggest one quick thing, you should start going by st. Paul. That's pretty good. That's cool, right?

156
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:05,040
It is your name's Paul just start getting people to call you st

157
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:10,100
But now that I'm cool that might be misleading though Justin for people who first meet st. Paul

158
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:14,720
But it might be like it's like a shit. It's sticky. I want to know everything about this

159
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:18,840
Yeah, yeah for sure. Who is it? Yeah, but what if they're really a saint?

160
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:21,200
What if they get sainted later because of like?

161
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:29,560
This is easy. This is easy st. St. Paul. Um, I think in high school, you know who was cool

162
00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:34,700
Not not me, but follow me. Okay, all that all the athletes

163
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:37,840
Who is second coolest?

164
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:43,680
You know kids not the equipment fuck. No, not the equipment manager. I kind of said it with my fingers crossed

165
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:45,040
I was really hoping

166
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:51,760
But it was the kid at the lunch table who would eat anything you can put in this cup for $1

167
00:13:54,520 --> 00:14:01,500
Right, and so it's just sometimes while you're waxing their boards and they're like definitely micromanaging like did you wax the middle?

168
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:06,080
You just scoop some of that wax up and you just take a big bite out of it

169
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:11,680
No, like hold what the holy shit. Did you just eat some of that wax and it's like yeah, I did

170
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:17,180
Why do you think I'm so good at this me and the wax or one and they're like, whoa, have you talked to st. Paul?

171
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:20,080
He eats board wax. You gotta see that

172
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:29,040
When you said the sentence have you talked to st. Paul he eats board wax

173
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:35,240
Did you realize that you had absolutely deep six this human being like you have absolutely lowered their stock

174
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:41,200
I don't think no, no, no, cuz then there that kid eats that kid eats paste that kid eats board wax. They are too

175
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:49,240
Awesome, and they started calling themselves st. Paul, right? That's actually that me. Is that because of all the board wax they've been eating?

176
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:53,040
Yeah a little bit

177
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:58,000
By the way, I never saw anybody eat paste my entire, you know school career

178
00:14:58,680 --> 00:15:03,120
But if I did I would want to know more about that person because that's a yes

179
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:09,440
Griffin, but not I think once again, you are only thinking about the interest but not

180
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:11,680
perhaps the

181
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:18,240
Kind of interest you would be a really quick like hey, I'm this you're eating pace. Yeah, I'm kind of pervert

182
00:15:20,280 --> 00:15:27,440
Yeah, I don't think that you would have a moment of like I'm interested in this kid on a really deep spiritual level

183
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:30,800
It doesn't have to be interested in a spiritual. We're just trying to be cool and come

184
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:37,960
Yeah, mysterious, but not eating. I feel like eating things. You're not supposed to eat is not it's really like cool

185
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:42,520
It's not cool. Unless you like unless one thing that I try to jump

186
00:15:42,520 --> 00:15:45,760
You can't write hop skip and jump over and unless like that unless

187
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:51,760
Unless when I was in middle school in high school more high school

188
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:57,400
I think for like a year or so. I tried to be cool by having a habit of

189
00:15:57,400 --> 00:16:02,200
Keeping a thumbtack in my mouth. Remember this, huh? Yeah

190
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:08,200
I do I did. I would like have a thumbtack in my mouth like the pointy side out, right?

191
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:12,960
I would have like chew on the plastic in and that's that's bonkers juicer

192
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:18,600
Yeah, I wish I hadn't said it now at least it's just between us three

193
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:26,320
Yeah, it's just like it was a I don't mind to be open about the ways in which I tried and failed

194
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:32,120
To look cool, to be cool, look cool, be cool, seem cool, sound cool, act cool

195
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:38,320
My any of it really yeah, cuz it worked out, you know, yeah inspirationally sure

196
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:43,040
I really really killed the mode there

197
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:51,080
revelation, I'm sorry. It's weird now as an adult to retroactively be really worried about my teenage or older brother

198
00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:54,560
Like that. I wish I could go back in time and just say like hey, bud

199
00:16:54,560 --> 00:17:01,720
You're cool enough. I'm trying to own myself as a holistic person. You know, I mean, I don't need to be that's not a different me

200
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:04,400
That's the same me that got us all here. Oh, that's weird

201
00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:08,920
They let drive my kids around. Yeah in a vehicle, you know

202
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:15,080
It is fun. I think that you should be able to like when you're like, I don't know filling out your taxes or whatever

203
00:17:15,080 --> 00:17:19,360
There should be a spot where it's just like you list all the actual dumb decisions you made

204
00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:24,480
And so then when you're like late on taxes, they're like, I'm just glad we got it at all

205
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:28,880
Yeah, see what this guy did when he was like 14 and oh my god

206
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:35,200
He ate a bunch of boardwax then yelled that his tummy was now a snowboard and then he'll then he'll hop on get ready to

207
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:40,800
Flip and I was like, I don't I don't think flipping is like the main thing in snowboarding

208
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:47,480
But at that point he was already grinding on every surface in the office. So and he was slippery. He was that

209
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:52,320
Can I do can I go approach the wizard humbly and

210
00:17:53,560 --> 00:17:59,680
Prostate myself in front of him. Yes, but I really think you need to look that up before we record again

211
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:01,680
Yeah, I don't think that that's exactly right

212
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:09,280
Unless you want the wizard to stick a finger in your butt. No, no, no, no. No, I don't I mean no

213
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:11,280
No, no, I don't want that

214
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:18,500
So here's this one sent in by Teo. Thank you. It's how to look gothic without your parents getting upset

215
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:21,800
Please we all

216
00:18:22,280 --> 00:18:27,400
You know have gone through and or are still going through this stage of our lives

217
00:18:27,560 --> 00:18:31,760
Yeah, and we all struggled with it because we were like, you know, we watched

218
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:34,600
Edward Scissorhands

219
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:37,400
yeah, the craft or

220
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:40,240
The craft just like the Addams family

221
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:47,720
Addams family saw that we're like, I would love to just sort of just chomp Raul Julia's

222
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:54,640
Style right now and be that yeah, but then we did it. We were just like overnight wham-bam. Thank you

223
00:18:54,640 --> 00:19:00,120
Thank you ma'am and came downstairs and we you know, we're perfectly cosplaying as

224
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:04,840
As Gomez Addams and our parents were like no, that's too much

225
00:19:04,840 --> 00:19:11,440
No, that's too much. But here is how to really do it without upsetting your parents because that's the most important thing

226
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:19,720
Part one nothing goth about upsetting your bear exactly to part one dressing goth transform yourself at a slow pace

227
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:25,600
Plan to look goth over an extended period

228
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:34,200
Incorporate clothes that identify you as goth one piece at a time and over many months create a six-month plan. Um

229
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:42,240
Cuz it's like the easiest way to boil a frog or by which I mean your parents you just they'd look at you one day

230
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:44,240
Why are you boiling your parents?

231
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:49,260
You're eight months in your parents like wait up. Wait a tick. Hold up. Hold up a second

232
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:54,520
You got a different sort of different flavor today. Hey, every Debbie

233
00:19:54,520 --> 00:19:56,720
Is Griffin always look like this?

234
00:19:57,640 --> 00:20:02,760
Yeah, I'm looking at him and I'm thinking is that new but then when I'm like

235
00:20:03,560 --> 00:20:09,360
Remembering Griffin for the last six to eight months. I can't remember a time where he didn't

236
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:13,840
Kind of look like this. Are we okay with this? Are we okay?

237
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:16,720
Yeah

238
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:18,720
Incorporate some bright colors into your fashion

239
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:24,720
Well, well by incorporating some bright colors, you'll send the signal that although you are goth. You are not going overboard

240
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:30,720
You can still easing in. Yes, don't rush it. No, it's savor it. Enjoy it

241
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:35,060
This is these are your final days as a normie and so you can you know?

242
00:20:35,560 --> 00:20:39,840
Enjoy that until you are ready to fucking, you know party party with the vampires

243
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:44,200
You also need to be able to back off of it if it's not like

244
00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:46,560
landing for yeah

245
00:20:46,560 --> 00:20:49,100
Like you need to be like I don't think I was

246
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:52,720
God, that doesn't sound right. No, don't you remember yesterday?

247
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:59,160
Like you came into school and you were like fully kitted out with like you remember it's like no

248
00:21:00,120 --> 00:21:05,520
I don't are you okay? Here's a good flip dress somewhat conservatively

249
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:11,300
While the color scheme of your goth style might frighten your parents you can temper this by embracing a somewhat conservative approach

250
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:14,240
the picture I am seeing here is

251
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:18,920
two people and there's a dude who is wearing like a

252
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:27,400
Very sleek blazer over a black button-up shirt with a black belt with some black pants and his hair is done

253
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:31,060
All good, and there's a lady with the same sort of fashion going on

254
00:21:31,060 --> 00:21:36,200
And I just am imagining one of us as a teenager walking downstairs in our

255
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:42,600
In our you know vampire going to a wedding outfit and just be like hello. Hello mother and father

256
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:45,920
Don't worry about me. I'm goth now

257
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:48,480
Well time to go to work

258
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:51,320
Yeah, gotta go. I got a shift at TCBY today

259
00:21:51,320 --> 00:21:56,280
I think if your kids got you got a cancel work that day and just talk through it you got to understand it

260
00:21:56,280 --> 00:22:02,040
Where's it from if nothing else just be like okay because when you go into the world with other teenagers

261
00:22:02,040 --> 00:22:08,200
They might be kind of shitty to you because that's how it works, and I'm listen. I support this 100%

262
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:14,440
I just want you to know that there will be assholes out there who will not and we're gonna talk through this

263
00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:19,840
I'm getting this right and to be clear. It's not because you're dressing goth. It's because you're wearing a

264
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:26,720
full suit a full men's magazine cover suit to your

265
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:34,320
8th-grade class you yes, you're swung hard into what I believe is called executive goth. Yes, exactly

266
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:39,280
and perhaps you want to start as a more casual goth and then only do

267
00:22:39,560 --> 00:22:46,320
Executive goth on I don't know like standardized testing days like weekend goth is is pretty impactful

268
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:51,200
What have you found what if you saw one of your teachers at TCBY yeah, and they're a weekend goth

269
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:56,360
And they're like you too. That's good, or you can do I think it's called like fitness goth

270
00:22:58,440 --> 00:23:02,960
Yeah, and you're like wearing like black tracksuits and stuff, and it's still very gothic

271
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:08,720
But you're also ready to get out there and work up a sweat. You could also do old old fisherman goth

272
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:13,100
Oh, that's where one where you you know you sort of fuse those two things together

273
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:18,560
And that one will confuse people a little bit, so be like who's that old old fisherman you like no

274
00:23:18,560 --> 00:23:20,440
It's it's it's me. I love me

275
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:26,060
Who's that old fisherman who looks so sad looks so sad, but also so fucking cool. Yeah

276
00:23:26,560 --> 00:23:31,840
There's a bunch of boring shit after that. Let's get into accessorizing focus on goth. That's where it is right

277
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:34,840
Yeah, if I saw someone in a black t-shirt and black jeans

278
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:38,880
I'm like okay, but then what's that a spiky wristband? Oh, okay?

279
00:23:39,320 --> 00:23:41,360
Yeah, it could be

280
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:49,280
JK Simmons if it's just that like a tight tight black t-shirt tight pants like you don't know it might be goth is that's a

281
00:23:49,280 --> 00:23:53,440
Fun game we could make that a game on this show is it goth or is it JK Simmons?

282
00:23:53,480 --> 00:23:56,520
Yeah, we don't actually know if he is part of that lifestyle

283
00:23:57,680 --> 00:23:59,780
Anyway is actually yeah, I do too

284
00:23:59,780 --> 00:24:04,520
I want that for accessories can help you transform your existing wardrobe into one with a gothic flair

285
00:24:04,580 --> 00:24:08,460
Yeah, I had a big bowling shirts face in high school

286
00:24:10,460 --> 00:24:15,180
Tossed on I want to call this episode my brother brother me revelations

287
00:24:15,180 --> 00:24:22,660
Yeah, I wonder if my brother my brother me a retrospective if I had maintained that look and also worn dark scarves

288
00:24:22,900 --> 00:24:28,340
Jewelry like snake bone hair pins a spider ring a bat bracelet, then it just says belts yeah

289
00:24:28,340 --> 00:24:32,540
Well, we all know yeah, that's practical, but here's the trick sometimes

290
00:24:33,380 --> 00:24:38,300
You skip the belt loops. It's just about just the belt is there as its own like tiny

291
00:24:39,180 --> 00:24:43,500
That's cool. That's and that's so fucking goth that is so fucking off

292
00:24:43,500 --> 00:24:46,980
This is if we've learned anything from the fact that fitness goth exists

293
00:24:47,220 --> 00:24:54,060
Yeah off is kind of like I think the fashion equivalent of like steampunk is to storytelling

294
00:24:54,060 --> 00:25:00,460
Where it meshes well with pretty much anything so like I could take say my phase in high school

295
00:25:00,700 --> 00:25:04,060
where I wore button-up shirts dress shirts and

296
00:25:05,020 --> 00:25:11,740
tear away exercise pants and dance shoes and add some goth accessories to that and now

297
00:25:12,260 --> 00:25:13,460
I'm

298
00:25:13,460 --> 00:25:18,940
Embarrassing goth you know what I mean just ties all the theater kid goth if you will but Travis by the yeah

299
00:25:19,140 --> 00:25:22,420
I'm sorry for how much I bullied you in high school

300
00:25:22,420 --> 00:25:25,540
I know I actually think you didn't boy me enough because like yeah

301
00:25:25,540 --> 00:25:32,540
I did that for a long enough period that some some older girls had an intervention for me

302
00:25:33,260 --> 00:25:38,700
Like hey, you seem cool. You gotta stop with you got it this look your pants

303
00:25:38,740 --> 00:25:43,100
You're you are in public your pants should not tear away. Yes

304
00:25:44,260 --> 00:25:50,300
Before there were you know like flash mobs yeah, maybe I was just ahead of the curve. You don't know

305
00:25:50,300 --> 00:25:52,300
um yeah, I'm

306
00:25:52,780 --> 00:25:56,620
You can be like mean just kind of like stop evolving your style at 16

307
00:25:56,660 --> 00:25:58,660
Just like get to 16 be like yeah, it's good

308
00:25:59,940 --> 00:26:01,900
Justin's in a short-sleeve button-down. I got it

309
00:26:01,900 --> 00:26:06,820
I'm gonna push back a little bit because you did I would say inject some Disney dad flair in there

310
00:26:07,100 --> 00:26:12,340
Yeah, later in life that was just a circumstance of where I happen to be when I needed a shirt. That's like that's

311
00:26:13,340 --> 00:26:19,580
Good point I would argue in high school juice you had yet to receive the Jimmy Buffett blood transfusion that

312
00:26:19,580 --> 00:26:21,020
transformed you

313
00:26:21,020 --> 00:26:23,020
Into the man you are that was

314
00:26:23,100 --> 00:26:28,460
Don't need fucking island vibes. You're on island time 24 hours a day, and you don't even realize yeah

315
00:26:28,460 --> 00:26:30,980
You need a cold eye of life of age

316
00:26:30,980 --> 00:26:34,860
You may be listening to this right now, and you might be in your house y'all days

317
00:26:34,940 --> 00:26:40,220
So you don't need he Jimmy says take the weather with you as the name one of his albums and the right

318
00:26:40,220 --> 00:26:43,620
That's you do that when you're young. You don't think about it with it when you're older

319
00:26:43,620 --> 00:26:47,780
You got to work at a little bit still attainable um avoid dying your hair black right away

320
00:26:47,780 --> 00:26:53,980
Oh, so fucking yeah, okay make that one. Yeah, no, it's too late

321
00:26:53,980 --> 00:26:58,660
I already I already did yeah, I already did that I assumed make that one yeah

322
00:26:59,540 --> 00:27:03,340
Cuz that's that one's gonna. That's one's good. Might I recommend purple?

323
00:27:03,980 --> 00:27:09,380
Yeah, much better. You'll still ruin a lot of pillowcases and white t-shirt

324
00:27:10,060 --> 00:27:11,900
Yeah

325
00:27:11,900 --> 00:27:17,900
Are you oh man Trav? Are you off? I'm no no no no no no no like I think about it

326
00:27:17,900 --> 00:27:21,140
I understand the impulse, and there's like zero judgment here obviously

327
00:27:21,740 --> 00:27:26,460
Some tact I'm a lot more emo than that. I'm like a like a dad

328
00:27:26,460 --> 00:27:31,580
You know like emo dad like a scene stir dad is what yeah, that's a lot more of my thing. Yeah, yeah

329
00:27:31,580 --> 00:27:35,460
yeah, yeah, yeah, it's like the music I'm listening to is like Panic at the Disco and

330
00:27:35,980 --> 00:27:39,620
And fallout boy where it's much more like elder emo Wow

331
00:27:39,620 --> 00:27:43,980
Yeah, you're not kidding. That really is sort of your set. Yeah, yeah guys

332
00:27:44,540 --> 00:27:52,460
Hey, we've known each other for a long time, right? I've never really thought of myself as someone who's living like life with an emo brother

333
00:27:53,100 --> 00:27:59,580
so when I have purple hair and I like eyeliner and like I'm wearing you know like a

334
00:28:00,140 --> 00:28:04,240
Suit with like a little like bird skull lapel pin

335
00:28:04,260 --> 00:28:09,420
Yeah, I bet Travis is it seemed like more like a costume than an expression of your off

336
00:28:09,420 --> 00:28:11,900
Now baby this but now I feel like you're living out

337
00:28:11,940 --> 00:28:17,140
Yeah, man my pride you know my problem, and I feel like this is something we could all learn from

338
00:28:17,780 --> 00:28:24,740
My problem is that I think of you too frequently as a person first hmm and labels second

339
00:28:24,740 --> 00:28:29,740
Oh, I feel like we could all do do well to try to think of people in terms of labels

340
00:28:29,780 --> 00:28:32,940
Yeah, yeah as a person second

341
00:28:32,940 --> 00:28:36,460
I'm working really hard to show my label and people are like yeah

342
00:28:36,460 --> 00:28:39,620
But I don't want to talk about that and it's like but that's all I want to talk about

343
00:28:40,820 --> 00:28:44,500
Please I'm gonna hop forward don't get any tattoos or piercings yeah

344
00:28:45,260 --> 00:28:49,660
And then we're gonna move on to part three because I'm assuming by the way that they will tell me when it is okay to dye

345
00:28:49,660 --> 00:28:55,220
My hair yeah, I'm just circle back on it if you're gonna delay me on it and eventually I can get tattoos and piercings, right?

346
00:28:55,900 --> 00:28:59,700
Someday yeah, I think could you do a an ombra?

347
00:28:59,700 --> 00:29:03,660
I think is what it's called where you just get a little bit of the hair dyed black

348
00:29:03,660 --> 00:29:09,980
Mmm, and then your parents will be like is he going is this hair going wait. It's not going gray. What's going on?

349
00:29:11,140 --> 00:29:17,940
So part three behaving well wait be true to yourself. You don't have to change your which one is it yes

350
00:29:19,620 --> 00:29:21,080
Be true to your best self

351
00:29:21,080 --> 00:29:26,940
I guess step two and this is an awesome one for like any one of these like lifestyle things and it's

352
00:29:27,460 --> 00:29:29,460
Number two get good grades

353
00:29:29,540 --> 00:29:30,900
Yeah

354
00:29:30,900 --> 00:29:34,500
They should put that in kind of saying they should put that in literally everything

355
00:29:35,820 --> 00:29:40,900
It's like how to live like Goku, and it's like it's just a practice meditation and get very strong

356
00:29:40,900 --> 00:29:43,180
And then it's gonna be like and then get good grades

357
00:29:43,780 --> 00:29:47,100
Because that's awesome. You're gonna learn stuff and have better opportunities

358
00:29:47,820 --> 00:29:52,840
And your parents will be very pleased with you even though you're living that full-blown Goku lifestyle

359
00:29:52,840 --> 00:30:00,320
Oh, man avoid friends who get into trouble. Yeah, you don't know what is going on on this list

360
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:02,960
I feel like somebody's grandma what wrote this yeah, right?

361
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:07,920
I will remind you listen sitting backwards on a no no Griffin. Yes, please your mind is curving

362
00:30:07,920 --> 00:30:13,120
The article is how to look gothic without your parents getting upset and so this one's like if you did dye your hair black

363
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:17,280
And you got six lip piercings, and then you found this article

364
00:30:17,280 --> 00:30:22,320
You'd be like fuck fuck fuck fuck, but then you get to part three, and it's like hey, it's okay

365
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:24,320
just get good grades and

366
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:30,360
That's really gonna knock this out of the park don't have friends who get into trouble and it shows somebody guys

367
00:30:30,360 --> 00:30:35,600
And they're smoking a cigarette no no no. Thank you. Yeah, stay away from an age

368
00:30:35,920 --> 00:30:38,840
What are they gonna do when they get on a long airplane flight? Oh?

369
00:30:38,840 --> 00:30:44,200
Yeah, exactly final one show respect to your parents the way you look might alienate your parents

370
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:47,400
But the way you act and talk to them is more important

371
00:30:47,400 --> 00:30:53,520
But here's the Kobayashi Maru if you're like mom dad. I know I have a different steez now

372
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:57,880
But I love you both, and I respect you and they say we love you, too

373
00:30:58,120 --> 00:31:03,800
Please go back to the change to dress it the way you used to you can't be like I respect you

374
00:31:04,760 --> 00:31:10,520
But but fuck no I look so cool now. You don't even get it. I'm down. I'm pulling down tail

375
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,000
24-7

376
00:31:14,280 --> 00:31:15,680
Understand

377
00:31:15,680 --> 00:31:19,200
Parents just don't understand how much tail I'm pulling with my new gothic style

378
00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:23,680
Because it can't be like the last step in this is like go back to normal if your parents

379
00:31:24,360 --> 00:31:25,580
Wicked don't like it

380
00:31:25,580 --> 00:31:30,920
you know what I mean like you could have good grades and get rid of your smoking friends and be true to yourself and

381
00:31:31,040 --> 00:31:32,480
all that and

382
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:40,120
They could still even after all that work be like go change go change you know here's what it is Griffin Griffin Griffin Griffin Griffin

383
00:31:40,120 --> 00:31:47,520
First before you do any of the style changes you start to get bad grades and hang out with kids who smell

384
00:31:47,520 --> 00:31:52,920
Oh my god, Travis. Yes, and then as you transition to the goth style

385
00:31:53,320 --> 00:31:59,880
Yeah, start to clean up your act, and they're like I don't know what it is, but is it's really working for them

386
00:31:59,880 --> 00:32:03,200
You know and they see it like they're connected. I

387
00:32:04,360 --> 00:32:06,920
Like that a lot. I like that a lot

388
00:32:06,920 --> 00:32:08,920
I like that a lot

389
00:32:09,560 --> 00:32:15,560
It's like when Justin got blonde highlights, and yeah, and then he started I didn't even volunteer that I

390
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:19,360
Thought it would be okay because we're all just sort of dish and dishing out this

391
00:32:21,040 --> 00:32:26,040
More like a self dish so far hasn't it felt like that so far that it's more of a

392
00:32:26,520 --> 00:32:33,360
Self dish like a self-serve eat. You know eat what you want kind of deal. No yeah, I think Griffin's right

393
00:32:34,280 --> 00:32:36,280
Justin anything you want to say about Griffin

394
00:32:36,280 --> 00:32:40,420
Yeah, no, I love my brother very much. You'd blast me. No

395
00:32:40,420 --> 00:32:43,080
I don't you don't want to talk about when he bought the

396
00:32:43,280 --> 00:32:46,960
Red goggles from Hot Topic and his friend Evan bought the green goggles

397
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:50,840
And then they switched one lens of both so they had red and green goggles

398
00:32:50,840 --> 00:32:54,320
Yeah, that's just he was going to see a 3d movie later that you want no

399
00:32:54,320 --> 00:32:59,040
I definitely wore them at school, but and that and that theater practice

400
00:32:59,400 --> 00:33:04,800
But are you are you they're called rehearsal Travis, but how are you gonna blast the coolest thing I've ever done in my life

401
00:33:04,800 --> 00:33:09,200
That's fair. Yeah, yeah, you know it's true. I

402
00:33:09,920 --> 00:33:12,520
Don't really want to blast you. I love my brother, okay?

403
00:33:13,520 --> 00:33:16,400
You did try to get people to call you Andy that one. Yeah, that's true

404
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:19,600
Well, I also tried to get the nickname shades going at church camp

405
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:24,360
This is all stuff that we've talked about on this show. We've been doing it for a billion billion trillion trillion trillion years

406
00:33:24,360 --> 00:33:38,280
Yeah, let's take a break and make some money right yeah, and then we'll come back and do some other things

407
00:33:38,280 --> 00:33:42,960
You guys know what I just built a website on Squarespace yesterday

408
00:33:43,400 --> 00:33:45,960
Did you? I did. What is it?

409
00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:50,300
I'm working on a new podcast that I'm executive producing called chasing immortality

410
00:33:50,300 --> 00:33:57,640
And I wanted to build a website for that and I made what's the website address chasing immortality pod calm, okay?

411
00:33:58,200 --> 00:34:02,020
And I think it's a I mean it's listen. It's it's nothing

412
00:34:03,040 --> 00:34:08,040
I'm really worried about I'm Charlie. I'm really worried about you. Did you just call Charlie Travis?

413
00:34:08,040 --> 00:34:12,400
I'm really worried about you now. I can find two words. I'm really worried about you Travis

414
00:34:13,200 --> 00:34:17,160
Website looks so expensive. Oh, and that you must have spent so much money

415
00:34:17,160 --> 00:34:25,280
Getting professional to design this website. Oh, no Justin Justin Justin Justin. You dumb piece of shit. I

416
00:34:25,960 --> 00:34:30,160
Made it myself in about like 30 to 40 minutes

417
00:34:30,840 --> 00:34:34,680
You're kidding me. No you stupid asshole. I made that

418
00:34:37,320 --> 00:34:44,240
Oh, you're right you're right hey friends in case you I should I should clarify for the bit Squarespace is great

419
00:34:44,240 --> 00:34:47,480
Travis actually did not work very hard on this website

420
00:34:48,280 --> 00:34:53,680
Take another pass at it. Yes, I did. I mean I'm gonna take another pass at it, but I needed something functional

421
00:34:55,240 --> 00:34:58,300
Started and the thing the bigger point Justin

422
00:34:58,300 --> 00:35:03,440
But I was trying to get to is I realized as I was making this was like how many websites

423
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:10,200
I have used at Squarespace to build for just kind of off-the-cuff like ideas. I've had a cup indeed and

424
00:35:10,760 --> 00:35:12,280

426
00:35:16,720 --> 00:35:23,120
I didn't have the copy up, and I know that there's many options. You could have gone with here Travis listen Justin's right don't let my

427
00:35:24,040 --> 00:35:26,640
work ethic reflect the quality of

00:35:28,200 --> 00:35:36,840
Hard they have beautiful customizable templates they do and it lets you sell products and services of all kind and everything's optimized for mobile out of

429
00:35:36,840 --> 00:35:41,640
The box, but I am a lazy turd, and I was like this has links

458
00:38:06,180 --> 00:38:10,500
In dead pilot society scripts that were developed by studios and networks

459
00:38:10,500 --> 00:38:14,060
But were never produced are given the table reads they deserve

460
00:38:14,340 --> 00:38:20,540
When I was a kid, I had to spend my Christmas break filming a PSA about angel dust. So yeah being a kid sucks sometimes

461
00:38:20,540 --> 00:38:28,180
Presented by Andrew Reich and Ben Blacker dead pilot society twice a month on maximumfun.org

462
00:38:29,420 --> 00:38:32,460
You know the show you like that hobo with the scarf who lives in a magic dumpster

463
00:38:36,380 --> 00:38:38,380
Doctor who

464
00:38:43,860 --> 00:38:45,860
I have lots of fish tanks

465
00:38:45,860 --> 00:38:52,140
What one of which is on my bathroom vanity the problem is that my bathroom is where I get dressed every morning?

466
00:38:52,700 --> 00:38:58,560
Because closing the blinds in my room takes effort, and I am lazy Travis you can certainly relate to this. I sure do

467
00:38:59,340 --> 00:39:02,460
Consequently my fish sees me naked a lot is this

468
00:39:04,180 --> 00:39:05,580
Inappropriate

469
00:39:05,580 --> 00:39:06,900
Huh?

470
00:39:06,900 --> 00:39:08,700
Hmm. That's some fishy business

471
00:39:08,700 --> 00:39:13,900
There is no way that a fish of any level of intelligence

472
00:39:13,900 --> 00:39:19,180
Could look upon the human form and parse it whatsoever, right?

473
00:39:19,700 --> 00:39:26,340
Not only are we like comparatively gigantic to them. Yeah, so many of the parts are different

474
00:39:26,820 --> 00:39:33,980
Yeah, you couldn't contextualize it. I don't even know if a fish has a has a beamis so what to I

475
00:39:34,780 --> 00:39:40,540
Mean listen, they got eyes and mouth and as far as I could tell the well, I just meant externally

476
00:39:40,540 --> 00:39:44,780
Parts that they can like look at us and be like I know those are eyes

477
00:39:45,260 --> 00:39:50,800
But what the fuck are those would be the rest of it? That's like elbows fingers shoulders

478
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:56,460
I'm not even getting into any of the like you know the stuff that are covered by clothes like I mean

479
00:39:56,460 --> 00:40:00,860
I can't I mean we could just start here. Okay, fish snake fish naked fish is absolutely naked

480
00:40:00,860 --> 00:40:06,700
Fish is naked fish has always been naked fishes naked fish doesn't even understand anything else other than naked

481
00:40:06,700 --> 00:40:11,500
Yeah, wait, but the first time your fish sees you naked your fish is like, okay, I get this

482
00:40:11,500 --> 00:40:14,780
Yeah, I tell you guys something this I can get into it just fucked me up

483
00:40:15,340 --> 00:40:19,420
What don't Google this but think right now our scales

484
00:40:20,140 --> 00:40:26,100
Fish's skin or are the scales covering their skin underneath are the scales?

485
00:40:26,100 --> 00:40:33,180
Yeah, or the scales like hair the scales are scales cuz it's fish. Yeah, but I mean like what's the what's the corollary, right?

486
00:40:33,180 --> 00:40:38,820
I don't know. It's not you don't mean to meta. You don't need to turn it into a metaphor. It's just scales, bud

487
00:40:38,820 --> 00:40:40,940
But are the scales the same different?

488
00:40:45,020 --> 00:40:48,260
But are the rocks their taxes think about it, yeah

489
00:40:51,220 --> 00:40:57,660
Listen you're being flippant cuz you don't know the answer and that's they're being flippant their fish. That's true. That's yeah, they're being a lipid

490
00:40:59,220 --> 00:41:00,740
I

491
00:41:00,740 --> 00:41:05,380
Just threw a die across the I was thinking I was think you were talking about how fish is naked

492
00:41:05,820 --> 00:41:09,380
When Don Knotts turns into the incredible, mr. Limpet

493
00:41:09,380 --> 00:41:15,100
First of all, he turns into a fish a real shark tail ass looking fish that looks a lot like Don Knotts

494
00:41:15,140 --> 00:41:21,460
But he also has glasses on so he's not completely nude if you think about it. Do you guys ever think that we talk about?

495
00:41:22,500 --> 00:41:27,860
Mr. Limpet so much that maybe we have thought it into existence and it is not

496
00:41:27,860 --> 00:41:30,580
Really actually? Yeah. Yeah, it's interesting

497
00:41:30,740 --> 00:41:31,260
Yeah

498
00:41:31,260 --> 00:41:36,140
Probably because when you think about it is a movie about a man who wishes to be a fish so hard that he turns into

499
00:41:36,140 --> 00:41:39,740
A fish and then helps the US government spot

500
00:41:40,420 --> 00:41:46,380
Like seat like mines in the sea. Yeah to protect submarines in the war

501
00:41:46,900 --> 00:41:48,900
Yeah, man, what a badass

502
00:41:49,140 --> 00:41:53,620
What a complete badass and then I think this man turned fish

503
00:41:53,620 --> 00:42:01,620
Has relations with another fish? Yeah, definitely. It definitely does that what a movie you guys and this is for kids

504
00:42:02,100 --> 00:42:06,440
Yeah, yeah. Well, it's the got it something for grown-ups, too. Yeah

505
00:42:07,140 --> 00:42:13,340
Travis you just got a fish tank. How do you feel about showing your near? I did it day one to establish dominance. Okay

506
00:42:14,220 --> 00:42:20,760
They were probably pretty wild now in there just like what's this new place? Oh, look, there's rocks this water tastes different

507
00:42:20,760 --> 00:42:26,840
Look at that big ass. Is that dude evil or what? What's his vibe?

508
00:42:27,960 --> 00:42:29,960
Whoa a butthole

509
00:42:31,640 --> 00:42:33,640
Why is he showing me this

510
00:42:33,800 --> 00:42:37,640
Fish got my holes fish. Are you freaked out by bowels? Yeah

511
00:42:37,640 --> 00:42:38,440
Yeah

512
00:42:38,440 --> 00:42:45,560
when I bought the fish or my fishing the person at the pet store said like that you had to put him you know in an

513
00:42:45,560 --> 00:42:50,440
Opaque bag to drive them home or else it could like scare the fish too much because

514
00:42:50,440 --> 00:42:56,800
It's the equivalent and there's a quote the equivalent of an alien abduction to them. Yeah, definitely

515
00:42:56,800 --> 00:43:03,840
Have you seen Nemo? And then I started thinking about how much farther that concept extends

516
00:43:04,480 --> 00:43:09,200
We're like if someone picked up me and put me in another house

517
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:15,560
Inside someone else's house. I and it's sorry. It started to get too much for me. I couldn't handle it. Yeah, I don't blame you

518
00:43:15,560 --> 00:43:24,560
I want to munch

519
00:43:27,160 --> 00:43:29,160
I want to munch

520
00:43:31,520 --> 00:43:34,280
In there, I didn't mean to be Dracula I was like

521
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:37,000
It's Italian. Oh

522
00:43:37,320 --> 00:43:41,760
I try to make it sound like Italian. Yeah, that's awesome, man. Wait, it's Dracula not Italian

523
00:43:41,760 --> 00:43:44,680
I'm Dracula Transylvania, but oh

524
00:43:45,280 --> 00:43:49,760
Right, right, right. Yeah garlic thing would have been a bigger deal. Yeah

525
00:43:50,560 --> 00:43:53,480
Okay, a new temptation is born

526
00:43:54,600 --> 00:43:59,760
The passionate kiss burger to enjoy. Oh, no say that ten times again

527
00:44:00,240 --> 00:44:04,800
The passionate kiss burger to enjoy with every bite. Is it brought to you by Gene Simmons?

528
00:44:05,640 --> 00:44:07,640
Hmm. What restaurant do you think is brought to you by?

529
00:44:08,080 --> 00:44:10,080
Mmm. Oh good question

530
00:44:10,080 --> 00:44:12,080
I'm gonna say

531
00:44:12,680 --> 00:44:14,680
hmm Red Robin

532
00:44:15,440 --> 00:44:17,440
interesting Griffin

533
00:44:17,440 --> 00:44:19,440
the passionate kiss burger

534
00:44:20,120 --> 00:44:23,880
Passionate kiss burger. It's got to be not one of the main ones

535
00:44:23,880 --> 00:44:28,600
I feel like it's gotta be a wild one like Dairy Queen or something like that. Oh, no, wait, hold on

536
00:44:28,600 --> 00:44:31,120
I'm gonna say Olive Garden because you said Italian earlier

537
00:44:32,920 --> 00:44:37,880
No, I mean literally Italian a new irresistible temptation

538
00:44:37,880 --> 00:44:45,200
Stemming from the creativity of Colonel Sanders. Why kiss burger now available in all KFC restaurants in Italy?

539
00:44:45,400 --> 00:44:48,500
Whoa, whoa is a chicken sandwich

540
00:44:49,480 --> 00:44:54,060
It's a bad start Italy, but go on a chicken sandwich for your burger

541
00:44:54,760 --> 00:44:58,560
Prepared according to the Colonel's original and secret recipe

542
00:44:59,640 --> 00:45:01,640
topped with double cheddar cheese

543
00:45:02,400 --> 00:45:03,960
crunchy bacon and

544
00:45:03,960 --> 00:45:10,720
Two delicious onion rings great. Enjoy every bite with the passion of a kiss because pleasure

545
00:45:11,400 --> 00:45:17,200
Knows no obstacles. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, not even topped with onions now Justin

546
00:45:17,200 --> 00:45:20,280
I I want you to know I listened to every word you just said

547
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:28,000
Mm-hmm. Are you telling me that the entirety of the name passionate kiss burger?

548
00:45:28,360 --> 00:45:30,360
Yeah is a lie

549
00:45:30,360 --> 00:45:38,520
No, because it is neither a burger nor has anything to do with a passionate kiss except that one might enjoy it

550
00:45:39,080 --> 00:45:41,080
With the passion of a kiss

551
00:45:41,360 --> 00:45:46,680
Yes, this is what I'm saying. It's a sandwich that break that is a kiss kiss burger

552
00:45:46,680 --> 00:45:51,600
What part of that don't you not understand in the advertising film? And yes, it is a film

553
00:45:52,080 --> 00:45:59,560
Colonel Sanders talks about the new burger in all its delicacy a sandwich that brings you closer that unleashes passion for kisses

554
00:45:59,560 --> 00:46:01,560
in couples of all ages

555
00:46:01,960 --> 00:46:08,200
Ethnicities and sexual orientations with onions on it. Yeah, the launch campaign of the new burger

556
00:46:08,880 --> 00:46:13,960
Plays with the cliche of the onion. Oh, which could turn people away after eating it

557
00:46:14,440 --> 00:46:19,000
But Colonel Sanders recipe is so good that it has the opposite effect

558
00:46:19,760 --> 00:46:21,760
everybody the sandwich triggers the

559
00:46:21,760 --> 00:46:29,700
Desire to share and rediscover the pleasure of being together. That's from Paulo Tofano head of marketing and communications

560
00:46:29,980 --> 00:46:31,980
at KFC Italia

561
00:46:33,180 --> 00:46:37,760
Is it a sorry you I I think I law I didn't pay attention there for about

562
00:46:38,380 --> 00:46:44,420
Interest record three quarters of a second and now I don't know if this is a movie or a chicken burger

563
00:46:45,420 --> 00:46:48,660
Right, so it's both. It's a sort of transmedia

564
00:46:48,660 --> 00:46:56,380
Experience where it's kind of a burger that they've adapted into an advertising film. Yeah a 30-second advertising film, right?

565
00:46:57,140 --> 00:47:01,300
Once again, we wanted Colonel Sanders as the protagonist of the commercial

566
00:47:01,780 --> 00:47:07,540
He is the best testimonial for the message. We want to continue to share at KFC

567
00:47:07,580 --> 00:47:13,760
We are all the same and invited to enjoy the chicken. Okay at KFC

568
00:47:13,760 --> 00:47:19,160
We're all the same and invited to enjoy the chicken. I love that

569
00:47:19,160 --> 00:47:25,720
That's the atmosphere the sharing and welcoming experience that we offer in our restaurants

570
00:47:26,200 --> 00:47:27,640
also

571
00:47:27,640 --> 00:47:34,760
Debunking some cliches like the one about onions. Is that a cliche though? What's the onion cliche?

572
00:47:34,760 --> 00:47:36,760
They do make your breath stinky

573
00:47:36,760 --> 00:47:44,220
It's but the recipe of passion for this burger. That's chicken is so powerful. Yeah that it gets you

574
00:47:45,040 --> 00:47:46,560

603
00:49:45,160 --> 00:49:51,760
Tonguing hard. Yeah, this is like kfc is trying to establish itself as like the new like make out spot

604
00:49:52,040 --> 00:49:58,440
That like oh, hey eat this burger get totally revved up and then taste each other's tonsils

605
00:49:58,440 --> 00:50:02,160
my dude is this now I understand why they're all like

606
00:50:03,160 --> 00:50:07,320
Talking about how onions have a bad taste and smell to them

607
00:50:07,480 --> 00:50:12,600
Yeah, because they're assuming that you are going to be chowing down on your partner's face

608
00:50:12,600 --> 00:50:20,640
Moments after consuming this big because it's not a burning because of consuming Griffin that is important. This is not like

609
00:50:21,520 --> 00:50:27,800
This is not the the burger is not superfluous to the experience but rather integral

610
00:50:28,160 --> 00:50:34,860
Without it. You are not going to be chowing down on each other's faces. Yeah. Hey cool commercial

611
00:50:35,140 --> 00:50:40,680
Did we talk about the fact that there's about a thousand scenes of people kissing like deeply deeply kiss

612
00:50:40,680 --> 00:50:44,600
Just one couple mind you a lot of couples. Maybe they

613
00:50:46,360 --> 00:50:48,260
They're like they love the burger flavor

614
00:50:48,260 --> 00:50:50,260
They're kissing the burger at the same time

615
00:50:50,440 --> 00:50:57,000
Like it's one of those like cool three-way kisses that you see in like cool movies that people do where it's like me

616
00:50:57,520 --> 00:51:04,400
My my beautiful wife and a chicken burger in between us with the stinkiest onions. I've ever been close to in my life

617
00:51:05,040 --> 00:51:10,600
But I do like the idea of each other stinky breath making it. Okay, right? We're eating the same burger

618
00:51:10,600 --> 00:51:17,940
So, you know what? We're all the same here at KFC. Everybody's breath is stinky. So let's just enjoy it and get into it. Yeah

619
00:51:19,200 --> 00:51:22,960
Cool commercial juice. Thanks for sharing that with us. Yeah, it's very good

620
00:51:23,160 --> 00:51:27,980
It doesn't look like a very good sandwich, but fuck you, but I would eat the hell out of that

621
00:51:28,040 --> 00:51:32,440
It looks good as hell. I'm really hungry though. Yeah, that's also true. It's about lunchtime here

622
00:51:32,920 --> 00:51:40,080
It's also really funny because there's 319 comments on this video that's been viewed 6,000 times, which is quite a huge ratio

623
00:51:40,080 --> 00:51:42,080
that's what

624
00:51:43,600 --> 00:51:45,600
KFC Italia has

625
00:51:46,280 --> 00:51:53,080
Put a comment on the on the top of it. That's like hey everybody, please be nice

626
00:51:55,200 --> 00:52:00,780
It's like can't see you have the power to turn correct comments off and can't see like no no no everybody gets there

627
00:52:00,780 --> 00:52:05,120
So you must be treatment speech, but be cool. Just please be cool

628
00:52:05,120 --> 00:52:10,540
Um, man, that was a good that I never want to I don't ever want to kiss again

629
00:52:11,040 --> 00:52:15,480
It's one of those things where it's like, oh, I'm think I'm done. I have I've had my fill

630
00:52:15,680 --> 00:52:23,120
They don't address choking hazards in this at all. Do they? Yeah. Hey, how come their colonel is maybe the handsomest?
