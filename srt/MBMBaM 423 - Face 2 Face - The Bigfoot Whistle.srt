1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:30,720
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:47,120
Hello, everybody, and welcome to My Brother, My Brother, and Me,

6
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:50,720
an advice show for the modern era. I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy.

7
00:00:50,720 --> 00:01:01,520
And I'm your middle-est brother, Travis McElroy.

8
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:12,160
And I'm your sweet baby brother and 30 under 30 media luminary, Griffin McElroy.

9
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:22,720
Hello, hello. You must be the city beautiful.

10
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:30,800
O-town. O-town? O-town. The band, not you. You all cheesing.

11
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:33,760
Are you all O-town the band? I'm just seeing if O-town is here.

12
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:38,320
I left them tickets at will call. They're a 2,000 person super group, O-town.

13
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:43,040
And they're a militia. Did you know O-town is a militia now?

14
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:49,120
90s kids, remember them? You'll never believe where they are now.

15
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:54,240
They're a militia. Oh, they live in the Everglades.

16
00:01:56,480 --> 00:02:02,960
So we have spent the last, it feels like goddammit, a year at Disney World.

17
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:13,040
Yeah. Okay. It's so choice. I've been there with my many children for two years in a row.

18
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:21,200
Paul asked me, did you have fun? And I told him, well, I'm a parent. So it's not so much

19
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:28,960
like having fun as is dying on the cross for the entertainment of your children.

20
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:37,120
Because I can't do any of the good stuff anymore. And they just, it's so hot.

21
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:44,240
And they don't care. They don't care. It's my problem that it's hot is my fault.

22
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:51,840
My favorite thing. So my daughter is almost two and it's really fun. No. And it's really fun

23
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:56,160
to watch as our personality develops. And like, there's something, because when

24
00:02:56,160 --> 00:03:01,680
they're a baby, you project a lot and you say like, oh, they love jokes.

25
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:05,200
But then when they actually form a personality, you're like, oh, I know what they like and don't

26
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:09,120
like now. And we were at a breakfast this morning, which unbeknownst to us,

27
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:16,720
turned out to be a character breakfast. And Rapunzel showed up and BB was like,

28
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:24,960
kind of like, okay. And then later Ariel showed up and BB was way into Ariel.

29
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:27,600
Much like teenage Travis.

30
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:33,040
And adult Travis.

31
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:41,520
And then, but in between, in between Rapunzel and Ariel and after Ariel,

32
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:47,520
Flynn Rider showed up and Prince Eric showed up and she was not into them.

33
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:54,960
This is, this is her with Rapunzel. Hmm. This is her with Flynn Rider and Prince Eric.

34
00:03:56,720 --> 00:04:01,760
By the way, I hope Prince Eric just picked up a frying pan and was Flynn Rider.

35
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:07,280
Cause there ain't no fucking difference. They're the same dude. Okay. Sorry.

36
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:10,080
Them and post-transformation beasts.

37
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:12,480
Have we, have.

38
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:16,480
Who isn't as attractive as pre-transformation beasts. So furries. I get it.

39
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:18,080
Sure. I get it.

40
00:04:18,080 --> 00:04:18,880
He's way more.

41
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:21,680
Pre-transformation beasts fights off like 12 wolves.

42
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:23,840
So beefy and diesel.

43
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:24,560
Here's my one.

44
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:25,280
Oh my God.

45
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:31,280
Here's my one about Disney. Here's my one. We all went to the animal kingdom, got wild

46
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:36,560
over there. And we got on the train over to Rafiki's Planet Watch.

47
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:38,720
Oh fuck. This is so choice.

48
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:41,840
Griffin, will you actually tell. Okay. I'll tell the first half.

49
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:46,160
So there's a guy there and he's like, there's a guy named Rick. He's an old man in front of us.

50
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:47,840
And Rick's like, and.

51
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:51,360
He's actually 25. He just worked with kids for the last five years.

52
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:57,920
He's like, and also no smoking is permitted on the train.

53
00:04:57,920 --> 00:05:01,200
And I start asking him in increasing volumes, like, can we vape?

54
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:03,760
Can we vape?

55
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:05,120
At this frequency.

56
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:11,360
Rick, can we vape? Hey Rick. Hey Rick. Rick, can we vape? Rick, can we vape?

57
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:12,320
At which point.

58
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:18,320
At which point the woman sitting next to Justin says, no.

59
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:24,240
So fucking choice. So tight.

60
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:26,400
Feed it to me slowly like grapes.

61
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:27,920
That's my shit right there.

62
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:30,400
That's my shit.

63
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:31,440
Cause Justin immediately went.

64
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:36,240
For the whole fucking train ride.

65
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:40,880
We went to the petting zoo, touching goats and shit.

66
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:46,240
And Justin was still like, fucking paralyzed by the, oh man.

67
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:47,040
It was so tight.

68
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:49,760
Here's my Disney thing.

69
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:53,120
Can we talk about how every fucking attraction at that park,

70
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:54,880
which I had a beautiful, wonderful time in.

71
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:56,240
This is the Walt Disney theater.

72
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:05,040
Every single attraction at that park has a scary part in it.

73
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:09,600
It's got a scary dubstep drop somewhere in the middle of it,

74
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:14,080
which isn't so good when you're there with a 20 month old and you're like,

75
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:15,440
oh, it's the Winnie the Pooh ride.

76
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:16,720
It's going to be great.

77
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:19,600
And then you've got like one room where you're going through the hundred acre wood

78
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:22,800
and there's Piglet like playing tug of war with Roo or some shit.

79
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:24,480
And you're like, this is so nice.

80
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:26,160
And the baby's like, this is so nice.

81
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:29,120
And then you turn the corner and you're in like Tigger's abyss

82
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:35,280
where it's fucking pitch black and he crawls out of the void and it's like,

83
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:36,880
time to bounce motherfuckers.

84
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:46,000
And then your cart rocks back and forth for what feels like 20 minutes.

85
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,280
And then you go into like the Heffalump nightmare zone

86
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:55,600
where these neon elephants scream like, I'm going to kill your son, Griffin.

87
00:06:57,920 --> 00:07:02,080
It's the longer portion of the ride than the 100 acre wood part.

88
00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:04,960
Like acid flashback is the long part.

89
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:07,360
During the Kilimanjaro Safari in Animal Kingdom,

90
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:09,280
it's like there's a zebra, there's a giraffe.

91
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:11,920
Uh oh, this bridge looks pretty rickety.

92
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:12,640
Whoa, whoa.

93
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:16,160
Why did there need to be a fucking scary part on this safari?

94
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:20,080
It's like Walt Disney was like, pleasure and pain.

95
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:22,160
Hot and cold.

96
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:24,880
We will have both.

97
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:29,200
So on this show, we talk about Disney and take your questions

98
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:31,280
and turn them alchemy like into wisdom.

99
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:34,960
We got a bunch of questions from you, the gathered audience.

100
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:36,560
Uh, so we're going to get to them now.

101
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:37,600
We got some other stuff.

102
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:42,160
Okay.

103
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:44,560
Oh, did you just turn on some speakers up there or something?

104
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:45,680
Nice.

105
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:48,400
So, all right, let's start over.

106
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:49,760
We did a Disney bit.

107
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:53,280
Oh, I didn't even get to the figment thing.

108
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:54,560
Oh, the figment broke down.

109
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:56,480
Oh, the figment broke down.

110
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:59,920
We are stuck on that shit for 45 minutes.

111
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:04,480
I want to say, I will say, I want to say one more bit about this.

112
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:07,520
Figment broke down and it was a ride.

113
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:10,080
My daughter was already like, I don't fucking think so, old man.

114
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:12,240
It seems whack as shit.

115
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:14,240
I know it's probably dope when dream master's there.

116
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:18,160
Now it's an old man from Monty Python shouting at me about my imagination.

117
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:19,520
I don't know about this.

118
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:25,280
Halfway through, it like fully, fully breaks down to where like lights are on.

119
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:29,520
They are coming and getting us off the ride, walking through.

120
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:30,240
Oh, my God.

121
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:31,280
Brutal.

122
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:34,560
Like talk about the fourth wall just like tinkly shattering.

123
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:36,640
And the worst imaginable ride.

124
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:39,040
Think use your imagination as you see.

125
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:45,120
We get back to the gate and there's a good natured cast member there

126
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:47,360
who scans our little magic band.

127
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:50,640
He's like, and we just put a free fast pass on there

128
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:53,920
and that's good for any ride in the park except for Soarin'.

129
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:58,320
And I asked him exactly how long would I have to be trapped on this ride

130
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:04,720
to get on the Soarin' because that must be one very good ride, mon frere.

131
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:08,320
Anyway, so that was an example of the kind of Disney stories

132
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:11,040
we've been telling for 30 minutes or so.

133
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:14,240
My friend has always had difficulty understanding boundaries

134
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:18,960
and she has often invited herself to things that she probably should not attend

135
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:24,960
such as my doctor's appointment and dates out with my super hot boyfriend.

136
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:26,160
OK, all right.

137
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:30,320
All right, how can I tactfully tell her that I'd like to be alone

138
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:34,000
with my gynecologist and also with my super hot boyfriend?

139
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:35,520
And that's from Jamie.

140
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:36,320
Jamie, are you here?

141
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:38,400
Nice.

142
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:38,640
Nice.

143
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:42,800
Jamie's, Jamie's boyfriend just sat up a little straighter.

144
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:44,000
See?

145
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:44,560
Oh, nice.

146
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:45,680
Oh, cool.

147
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:46,640
I guess so.

148
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:47,280
That's me.

149
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:52,160
Yowza.

150
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:54,240
That's rough.

151
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:55,520
How does that go?

152
00:09:55,520 --> 00:09:58,880
Like, do you like you're with the friend and you're like,

153
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:01,120
well, I got to go to a doctor's appointment and they're like,

154
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:03,520
cool, room for a little school.

155
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:04,320
Shotgun.

156
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:14,400
Is it possible, is it possible that they're in the market for a new gynecologist

157
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:18,560
and they just want to see how they work it?

158
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:22,240
Just want to see how they do it.

159
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:24,560
How do they do it? How does your gynecologist do it?

160
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:26,480
Maybe you're like, sit in the back.

161
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:29,600
Your friends like judging and praising like, hmm, pretty good.

162
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:32,480
Other side of that coin.

163
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:34,800
Are they in the market for a super hot boyfriend?

164
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:35,920
Right.

165
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:38,000
And they just want to see how your super hot boyfriend works.

166
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,480
I've been thinking about getting a super hot boyfriend myself.

167
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:44,400
Let me see how it's, let me kick the tires on this relationship.

168
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:45,520
See if it's worth the effort.

169
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:47,440
Oh, kissing.

170
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:47,760
Good.

171
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:49,600
I heard of that.

172
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:50,320
I like it.

173
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:52,960
Yeah. Nice.

174
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:53,760
Smooch it out.

175
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:57,280
Is your friend at all supportive when they're there at these places with you?

176
00:10:57,280 --> 00:10:58,320
He's asking rhetorically.

177
00:10:58,320 --> 00:10:59,920
Of course you're a thousand years away.

178
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:07,520
Is there that much variety in the gynecologist game?

179
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:10,080
I have no way of answering this question.

180
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:11,120
Neither do you two.

181
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:15,680
Nobody on this stage knows how to answer that question.

182
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:16,160
Oh no.

183
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:21,920
Oh, who was that for?

184
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:25,680
My wife is backstage like screaming like, yeah, some are terrible.

185
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:26,400
Yeah, probably.

186
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:31,280
And some super hot boyfriends are also pretty, pretty bad.

187
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:33,520
Not, not that one though.

188
00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:34,560
You're all right.

189
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:37,840
Jamie, is your super hot boyfriend here?

190
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:39,280
Yeah.

191
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:43,840
I did hear a second.

192
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:47,280
Yeah, there where I might say kudos on the confidence.

193
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:48,400
Can we get actually silenced?

194
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:51,200
Obviously we can't see you and we wouldn't want to put you on blast like that.

195
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:54,320
But just like we can tell from the voice, if you can just say like, yeah, I'm here.

196
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:04,000
That's a good bank, Mary.

197
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:04,560
Damn.

198
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:05,280
Damn, Mary.

199
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:06,560
Damn, Mary.

200
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:08,400
That's a good bank.

201
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:08,640
Damn.

202
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:10,960
That shit proved just long enough, Mary.

203
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:11,200
Damn.

204
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:12,720
Look at that crumb.

205
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:16,160
No soggy bottom on that one.

206
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:17,360
Damn, Mary.

207
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:18,240
Damn.

208
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:18,960
Good bank.

209
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:20,240
Shit.

210
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:22,960
Let me get like something else.

211
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:25,600
Like, hey, come hop in my Jaguar.

212
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:29,520
Hold on, wait.

213
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:30,480
One, two, three, go.

214
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:38,960
We've got a star baker right here.

215
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:42,080
Damn, I'm about to get the vapors up here.

216
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:42,400
Shit.

217
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:44,960
That's a beefy guy you got there.

218
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:45,360
Dang.

219
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:51,600
Can you, maybe she just thinks he's sexy and wants to be around him.

220
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:55,840
Maybe your friend is just trying to steal your boyfriend.

221
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:57,600
No problem at all.

222
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:59,520
Maybe she's Mr. Steal Your Man.

223
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:00,080
No, listen.

224
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:04,080
What if, I mean, can you blame her though?

225
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:05,200
That's kind of where I'm at.

226
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:07,840
He's just a disembodied voice in the darkness to me,

227
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:10,320
and I already want to take him to Chunky Cheese.

228
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:12,400
Shit.

229
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:14,800
It sounded like you said Chunky Cheese.

230
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:18,480
That's a different place where we are going.

231
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:20,960
How about a Yahoo?

232
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:26,960
This one was sent in by Adrian Cowles.

233
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:28,160
Thank you, Adrian.

234
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:32,480
It's Yahoo Answers user, Amen, who asks.

235
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:32,960
Hey, wait.

236
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:33,680
Quick timeout.

237
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:37,920
Before I forget, can you please record yourself saying that stuff

238
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:40,160
and email it to us so we can put it in the episode?

239
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:40,640
Oh, yeah.

240
00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:41,760
We have to edit it in later.

241
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:43,680
We're going to edit it in in post, so if you could do that.

242
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:45,440
And I'll say Justin just wants it for a reason.

243
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:47,200
You could just, shut up.

244
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:48,880
You can just use voice memos.

245
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:49,920
Yeah.

246
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:50,800
Figure it out.

247
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:52,400
Amen is your chance to start them.

248
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:57,200
Amen asks, there's an important surfing competition in September.

249
00:13:57,200 --> 00:14:00,000
Dad, I want to go to that before I graduate college.

250
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,920
Please, Dad, please say yes.

251
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:03,840
Please, Dad, please say yes.

252
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:07,860
Huh.

253
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:13,520
That's the narrowest cast I've ever seen.

254
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:17,120
That's like saying, I want to catch that fish.

255
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:19,220
What?

256
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:20,720
Is it your son?

257
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:21,680
Is it your son?

258
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:22,480
It's my son.

259
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:25,120
He's 20 months old.

260
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:28,240
He's got some time till college.

261
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:31,280
Unless he's a real Doogie Howser.

262
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:32,960
Have you heard of Baby Freshman?

263
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:34,800
He's so cool.

264
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:37,200
Skateboards to class on his knees.

265
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:38,560
Can't walk super good yet.

266
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:42,560
He's doing so bad.

267
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:44,160
Can't read.

268
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:45,040
Can't read or talk.

269
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:45,840
So bad.

270
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:46,800
So bad.

271
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:48,000
He is a college student.

272
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:52,400
Failure at all of it.

273
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:59,920
At all of it, yeah, so that's a hard no from me to my son,

274
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:01,600
but that's probably not what they're asking.

275
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:04,480
That's how your son is trying to get in touch with you.

276
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:07,440
That's how Griffin tells his son he has to contact him.

277
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:09,200
Yeah, Griffin's son walks in and says,

278
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:10,800
hey, Dad, I have a quick question for you.

279
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:13,600
And I say, holy shit, you're talking so good.

280
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:14,100
How?

281
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:15,200
No, you said-

282
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:16,080
Put it in the bit.

283
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:17,200
Okay, I'm in the bit.

284
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:18,000
Go in the bit.

285
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,680
Hey, Dad, I have a question for you.

286
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:21,360
Okay, yes, yes.

287
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:24,400
But you know how to do this, though.

288
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:26,960
You know the correct way to file a question with your father.

289
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:29,040
Dad, please, I'm in the room.

290
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:32,560
The only means of communication that mean fucking anything to me anymore

291
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:33,680
is Yahoo Answers.

292
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:38,080
I've been on this website for 20 some odd years now.

293
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:39,520
Yes, type away.

294
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:40,020
Send.

295
00:15:41,280 --> 00:15:42,080
Any responses?

296
00:15:42,640 --> 00:15:45,040
There's one from Lucifer Morningstar.

297
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:45,540
Okay.

298
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:49,440
Okay, not a given name.

299
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:51,600
Lucifer Morningstar did say,

300
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:56,400
seems you have skipped classes before, mahalo.

301
00:15:58,400 --> 00:15:59,920
Do you mean mahalo?

302
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:02,080
Like if you're trying to dunk on somebody?

303
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:05,280
What a weird way to end that, like, seems like you skip classes.

304
00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:05,780
Mahalo.

305
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:07,620
Mahalo.

306
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:12,240
Also, how do you know they've skipped class?

307
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:14,320
Oh, because they spelled September with two Ps.

308
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:15,280
I'm looking at it now.

309
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:18,320
It's my son, Travis, can you not?

310
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:20,800
So what do you say?

311
00:16:21,520 --> 00:16:23,600
Yeah, I mean, no, you definitely can't.

312
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:26,480
Because that means I have to go to the surfing competition

313
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:28,320
and I've got stuff to do in September.

314
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:31,120
Wait, hold on, there's something.

315
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:33,120
I just found something on the news, sir.

316
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:35,760
Riddled me piss!

317
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:46,240
Riddled me piss!

318
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:49,360
I found a riddle beneath the table.

319
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:53,280
I've never had to look at you do it before.

320
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:57,040
Do you do the eyes when you're at your house?

321
00:16:57,040 --> 00:16:57,680
Yes, I do.

322
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:00,480
It's a whole thing.

323
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:02,320
Sure.

324
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:05,440
So as I'm sure everybody knows, riddle me piss.

325
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:07,280
If you've listened to the last two episodes,

326
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:08,480
if you've been skipping lately,

327
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:10,160
which I totally don't blame you for.

328
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:13,280
You're probably very confused.

329
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:14,560
We do riddles now.

330
00:17:14,560 --> 00:17:16,880
Travis does this whole green goblin thing.

331
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:17,600
It's dope.

332
00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:22,880
This was a submission by Hal.

333
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:25,520
There are people finding these for us now?

334
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:26,080
Yes.

335
00:17:26,080 --> 00:17:26,880
It's a bummer.

336
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:28,480
Now listen closely.

337
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:31,920
There are very many elements at play here.

338
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:32,420
Shit.

339
00:17:32,420 --> 00:17:36,580
Riley has four dogs.

340
00:17:37,540 --> 00:17:40,500
Ben has seven dogs.

341
00:17:41,780 --> 00:17:45,380
Ashley with an E has two fish.

342
00:17:46,020 --> 00:17:50,180
Ashley without an E has six fish.

343
00:17:50,900 --> 00:17:55,620
How many fish does Ashley with an E have?

344
00:17:55,620 --> 00:18:04,100
Wait, is this just a...

345
00:18:04,100 --> 00:18:05,620
Can you read it again like a human?

346
00:18:05,620 --> 00:18:06,580
No, because it's a memory challenge.

347
00:18:06,580 --> 00:18:08,660
Riley has four dogs.

348
00:18:09,540 --> 00:18:11,540
Ben has seven dogs.

349
00:18:12,260 --> 00:18:15,860
Ashley with an E has two fish.

350
00:18:15,860 --> 00:18:16,900
This is Travis' normal voice.

351
00:18:16,900 --> 00:18:20,500
Ashley without an E has six fish.

352
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:25,140
How many fish does Ashley with an E have?

353
00:18:25,860 --> 00:18:26,360
Two.

354
00:18:27,060 --> 00:18:28,340
Nah, y'all dumb.

355
00:18:30,580 --> 00:18:31,380
Eight.

356
00:18:31,380 --> 00:18:34,340
Ashley with an E and Ashley without an E are sisters.

357
00:18:46,260 --> 00:18:48,580
That is no exaggeration.

358
00:18:48,580 --> 00:18:51,540
The worst hurdle I've ever heard in my entire life.

359
00:18:51,540 --> 00:18:52,340
Yes, okay.

360
00:18:52,900 --> 00:18:57,460
Because it also assumes that there are parents who named both their daughters Ashley,

361
00:18:57,460 --> 00:18:58,420
but with varying...

362
00:18:59,380 --> 00:19:00,580
Maybe they're twins.

363
00:19:02,020 --> 00:19:07,620
But also, she doesn't.

364
00:19:07,620 --> 00:19:12,260
Because what we've established is two belong to one and six belong to the other.

365
00:19:12,260 --> 00:19:13,220
She doesn't.

366
00:19:14,180 --> 00:19:15,220
She has two.

367
00:19:16,100 --> 00:19:17,620
There are two fish.

368
00:19:17,620 --> 00:19:19,220
There are four lights.

369
00:19:19,220 --> 00:19:27,140
Also, why did we need to catalog the dogs at the beginning of the riddle?

370
00:19:27,780 --> 00:19:29,620
That was a red herring.

371
00:19:29,620 --> 00:19:30,820
No, it was a dog.

372
00:19:33,620 --> 00:19:34,660
That sucked.

373
00:19:34,660 --> 00:19:35,940
That sucked a lot.

374
00:19:35,940 --> 00:19:37,220
That fucking sucked, dude.

375
00:19:38,420 --> 00:19:39,060
Damn.

376
00:19:39,060 --> 00:19:40,660
And that was Riddle Me Please.

377
00:19:40,660 --> 00:19:41,060
Thank you.

378
00:19:43,220 --> 00:19:44,260
You deserve that.

379
00:19:44,260 --> 00:19:44,660
Thank you.

380
00:19:44,660 --> 00:19:46,820
Oh, thank you.

381
00:19:47,540 --> 00:19:50,660
I live in Orlando, which means by default, I work in a theme park.

382
00:19:53,460 --> 00:19:56,100
Oh, he gives one to Justin, takes Travis's away.

383
00:19:56,740 --> 00:19:58,660
That's just whiskey and ice, Paul.

384
00:19:58,660 --> 00:19:59,460
Ladies and gentlemen...

385
00:19:59,460 --> 00:20:00,740
Oh, that explains a lot.

386
00:20:00,740 --> 00:20:03,700
Ladies and gentlemen, while I love working in...

387
00:20:03,700 --> 00:20:04,020
Hold on.

388
00:20:04,020 --> 00:20:05,380
Start this question over, please.

389
00:20:05,380 --> 00:20:12,340
I live in Orlando, O-Town, which means by default, I work in a theme park.

390
00:20:12,340 --> 00:20:16,500
While I love working in the Wizarding World of Harry Potter at Universal Studios...

391
00:20:17,380 --> 00:20:18,260
You've heard of it.

392
00:20:18,260 --> 00:20:20,340
It's sometimes hard to stay in character.

393
00:20:20,340 --> 00:20:24,580
About once a week, a child will point their wand at me and say, Avada Kedavra.

394
00:20:26,900 --> 00:20:28,980
Which, that's the killing curse.

395
00:20:30,180 --> 00:20:33,460
How do I keep in character while dealing with homicidal children?

396
00:20:37,300 --> 00:20:37,780
Robbie.

397
00:20:37,780 --> 00:20:41,220
No, it says in parenthesis, P.S. Travis, your hair looks great today.

398
00:20:44,020 --> 00:20:47,380
The parenthetical, I assumed, was just not for public consumption.

399
00:20:47,380 --> 00:20:47,860
Oh, maybe.

400
00:20:48,660 --> 00:20:50,180
I think if you get hit with a...

401
00:20:52,180 --> 00:20:53,540
Sorry, I'm a...

402
00:20:53,540 --> 00:20:54,340
If you don't say it right, it doesn't...

403
00:20:54,340 --> 00:20:55,460
I'm more of a sports guy.

404
00:20:55,460 --> 00:20:55,940
Yeah.

405
00:20:55,940 --> 00:20:56,440
Hold on.

406
00:20:57,140 --> 00:21:01,940
Avada Kedavra, I think you lay down on the ground, and it's break time.

407
00:21:03,700 --> 00:21:05,060
It's break time for you.

408
00:21:05,060 --> 00:21:07,380
It's break time for you.

409
00:21:07,380 --> 00:21:08,820
Josh or me, get back to work.

410
00:21:08,820 --> 00:21:09,540
I can't.

411
00:21:09,540 --> 00:21:10,500
I'm dead.

412
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:11,540
I'm dead.

413
00:21:12,100 --> 00:21:13,460
That little muggle killed me.

414
00:21:15,860 --> 00:21:17,220
I'm amazed because...

415
00:21:17,220 --> 00:21:19,940
Okay, here's the sad truth.

416
00:21:20,900 --> 00:21:26,100
I thought about what would happen if you did this when I was at Harry Potter on Wednesday,

417
00:21:26,100 --> 00:21:28,180
and I had a wand that I bought.

418
00:21:28,180 --> 00:21:30,980
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

419
00:21:30,980 --> 00:21:34,660
Wait, you thought about killing somebody at the Wizarding World of Harry Potter?

420
00:21:35,220 --> 00:21:38,580
Hey, I don't know if you've been to the Wizarding World of Harry Potter recently.

421
00:21:38,580 --> 00:21:40,660
I thought about killing a lot of fucking people.

422
00:21:44,180 --> 00:21:44,660
Thank you.

423
00:21:45,460 --> 00:21:48,900
And here's what I no joke assumed would happen.

424
00:21:48,900 --> 00:21:53,780
If I said Avada Kedavra, everybody that was working and maybe some other people too would go

425
00:21:55,380 --> 00:21:58,900
and then I would be arrested and put in a wizard jail.

426
00:21:58,900 --> 00:22:02,980
I would be sent to Azkaban, i.e. outside the park.

427
00:22:03,940 --> 00:22:08,500
That's how you start the ARG where you get thrown into the wizarding jail of Harry Potter.

428
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:12,980
Or if they were just like, that fucking sucks.

429
00:22:13,860 --> 00:22:15,140
What if that worked?

430
00:22:15,140 --> 00:22:15,780
Get out of here.

431
00:22:15,780 --> 00:22:16,900
Hey, wait, are you here?

432
00:22:17,780 --> 00:22:18,580
Cool.

433
00:22:18,580 --> 00:22:23,060
I would lean into the role play and just look at them and be like, are you a wizard?

434
00:22:23,060 --> 00:22:24,020
No, I thought not.

435
00:22:24,020 --> 00:22:25,780
You bought a ticket to get in here, idiot.

436
00:22:25,780 --> 00:22:29,940
That's a stick of wood in your hand and you're talking a bunch of baby talk

437
00:22:29,940 --> 00:22:33,140
and then snap the wand over your knee and they'll go get another one

438
00:22:33,140 --> 00:22:36,180
and you'll get fired and there's not an end to the paragraph.

439
00:22:37,460 --> 00:22:39,540
They'll be in a lot of trouble for no reason.

440
00:22:39,540 --> 00:22:40,980
So don't do what Justin said.

441
00:22:40,980 --> 00:22:41,940
Don't do what I said.

442
00:22:41,940 --> 00:22:44,260
Is there a jail at Universal Studios?

443
00:22:45,220 --> 00:22:45,700
Yes.

444
00:22:45,700 --> 00:22:47,220
It's probably not fun.

445
00:22:47,220 --> 00:22:48,500
Like, poor kids.

446
00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:53,860
There's probably not dementors floating around and old wizards like Bellatrix Lestrange,

447
00:22:53,860 --> 00:22:56,020
like, what are you?

448
00:22:56,020 --> 00:22:58,100
And it's probably just kind of jail.

449
00:22:58,100 --> 00:23:00,260
Just people who got drunk at most have.

450
00:23:00,260 --> 00:23:01,140
Hey, P.S.

451
00:23:01,860 --> 00:23:03,380
One, it's called The Brig.

452
00:23:03,380 --> 00:23:11,460
Two, way too many of you were able to confirm the presence of a jail at Universal Studios.

453
00:23:12,260 --> 00:23:13,220
How's it going?

454
00:23:13,780 --> 00:23:17,140
A lot of people trying to step on Krusty's feet, it would seem.

455
00:23:18,580 --> 00:23:19,460
Dag.

456
00:23:19,460 --> 00:23:24,260
A lot of y'all went to Universal Jail.

457
00:23:24,260 --> 00:23:25,060
How about a Yahoo?

458
00:23:27,860 --> 00:23:29,620
Here's one sent in by Graham Roebuck.

459
00:23:29,620 --> 00:23:30,180
Thank you, Graham.

460
00:23:30,180 --> 00:23:34,980
It's from Yahoo Answers user Magical Hats, who asks,

461
00:23:34,980 --> 00:23:39,540
have any of you ever used a video game slash movie fight move in real life?

462
00:23:39,540 --> 00:23:41,700
If so, please tell me how it went.

463
00:23:44,900 --> 00:23:46,500
One time I inhaled a guy.

464
00:23:46,500 --> 00:23:49,620
A guy like Kirby.

465
00:23:50,820 --> 00:23:51,780
Like Kirby?

466
00:23:51,780 --> 00:23:52,020
Yeah.

467
00:23:53,380 --> 00:23:55,540
Like he came at me fist swing and I just went.

468
00:23:57,780 --> 00:23:59,700
And you got him, you got him down.

469
00:23:59,700 --> 00:24:00,580
I inhaled him.

470
00:24:00,580 --> 00:24:00,980
Cool.

471
00:24:00,980 --> 00:24:02,260
Did you get his powers?

472
00:24:02,260 --> 00:24:02,980
I did.

473
00:24:02,980 --> 00:24:03,460
Awesome.

474
00:24:03,460 --> 00:24:04,900
He had purple hair.

475
00:24:04,900 --> 00:24:05,220
Yeah.

476
00:24:07,060 --> 00:24:09,460
And that's, that's.

477
00:24:11,940 --> 00:24:13,060
I nailed him.

478
00:24:13,060 --> 00:24:14,020
I nailed him.

479
00:24:14,020 --> 00:24:15,060
That's my defense.

480
00:24:15,060 --> 00:24:15,860
All right.

481
00:24:15,860 --> 00:24:16,820
Doesn't seem likely.

482
00:24:19,060 --> 00:24:20,900
I did a booger man to a guy once.

483
00:24:23,380 --> 00:24:24,420
I did a booger man.

484
00:24:24,420 --> 00:24:25,700
I did a matrix jump.

485
00:24:27,220 --> 00:24:28,100
So cool.

486
00:24:28,100 --> 00:24:29,460
I did both at once once.

487
00:24:30,500 --> 00:24:34,500
When I was in seventh grade, the kids would fall over every time I had Duke.

488
00:24:34,500 --> 00:24:38,100
And then I found out at the end of the year, they all thought I was really sick.

489
00:24:38,100 --> 00:24:43,380
So they were just, they were just humoring me.

490
00:24:43,380 --> 00:24:43,860
What?

491
00:24:43,860 --> 00:24:45,300
Is that a real story?

492
00:24:45,300 --> 00:24:47,700
No, Griffin, it's a fucking grand fabrication.

493
00:24:49,300 --> 00:24:51,540
A beautiful crystalline egg.

494
00:24:51,540 --> 00:24:54,180
A lovely lacy decolletage.

495
00:24:54,820 --> 00:24:55,860
That's not the right word.

496
00:24:55,860 --> 00:24:56,980
That's not the right word at all.

497
00:24:56,980 --> 00:24:58,020
Like a lacy.

498
00:24:59,140 --> 00:25:01,460
Just like a beautiful fabrication.

499
00:25:01,460 --> 00:25:02,100
Yeah, no.

500
00:25:02,100 --> 00:25:02,740
No, and you tricked.

501
00:25:02,740 --> 00:25:03,060
It's a good trick.

502
00:25:03,060 --> 00:25:05,620
Porcelain, porcelain, you know.

503
00:25:06,180 --> 00:25:07,780
There's some really good answers on this.

504
00:25:07,780 --> 00:25:09,380
Gossamer Daydream.

505
00:25:09,380 --> 00:25:09,700
Sure.

506
00:25:11,060 --> 00:25:11,460
Bane.

507
00:25:11,460 --> 00:25:18,420
Yahoo Answers Bane and you know it's going to be tight already says, kind of.

508
00:25:18,420 --> 00:25:21,140
Total War games made me a better driver.

509
00:25:21,140 --> 00:25:22,420
I became, yeah.

510
00:25:23,700 --> 00:25:28,020
I became very tactical in busy parking lots and became a master of traffic lights.

511
00:25:29,300 --> 00:25:32,020
Are there a lot of those in Total War?

512
00:25:32,020 --> 00:25:32,660
Uh huh.

513
00:25:32,660 --> 00:25:35,860
I can avoid cluster fucks and red lights like a champ.

514
00:25:35,860 --> 00:25:40,740
I got so good at strategic driving in my area that I let people road rage already knowing

515
00:25:40,740 --> 00:25:44,980
that they're going to get jammed up and I will pass them at the speed limit with a smile.

516
00:25:46,660 --> 00:25:51,620
Lots of flanks and figuring out what drivers are going to do before they do it.

517
00:25:51,620 --> 00:25:53,940
I mix this with the knowledge of the traffic light.

518
00:25:53,940 --> 00:25:55,780
I'm a real force to be reckoned with.

519
00:25:55,780 --> 00:25:57,860
I apply this when I'm on foot as well.

520
00:25:57,860 --> 00:26:01,540
In addition, I have not been pulled over by police in nine years.

521
00:26:01,540 --> 00:26:02,820
Total War did this.

522
00:26:06,500 --> 00:26:07,060
Powerful.

523
00:26:07,060 --> 00:26:11,700
I guess my question to that is what knowledge of the traffic light besides like,

524
00:26:11,700 --> 00:26:12,660
ah, that's red.

525
00:26:12,660 --> 00:26:14,020
I can't go anymore.

526
00:26:14,020 --> 00:26:14,500
Yeah.

527
00:26:17,140 --> 00:26:22,340
Yahoo Answers user Stallion says, let's just say trying shadow clone jitsu in a fight is

528
00:26:22,340 --> 00:26:23,380
not a good idea.

529
00:26:23,380 --> 00:26:24,580
It's not my fault.

530
00:26:24,580 --> 00:26:25,620
I got crushed.

531
00:26:25,620 --> 00:26:27,460
His power level was over 9,000.

532
00:26:27,460 --> 00:26:28,260
What was I thinking?

533
00:26:28,260 --> 00:26:29,300
How could I be so careless?

534
00:26:29,300 --> 00:26:31,140
I need to practice my chakra.

535
00:26:31,140 --> 00:26:32,340
So good.

536
00:26:33,780 --> 00:26:35,540
Yahoo Answers user question mark says,

537
00:26:35,540 --> 00:26:38,100
Yahoo Answers user question mark says, not yet.

538
00:26:40,340 --> 00:26:41,700
Thank you for weighing in.

539
00:26:42,260 --> 00:26:43,860
But I have big plans.

540
00:26:43,860 --> 00:26:45,300
Thanks for getting in there.

541
00:26:48,020 --> 00:26:51,380
It occurred to me we didn't explain the name tags.

542
00:26:51,380 --> 00:26:54,580
So people probably think that we're kind of jokesters and pranksters.

543
00:26:54,580 --> 00:26:55,460
Are you not wearing your script?

544
00:26:55,460 --> 00:26:56,180
I was on my hoodie.

545
00:26:56,180 --> 00:26:57,940
I took it off when we were talking about the BG boyfriend.

546
00:26:57,940 --> 00:26:58,340
All right.

547
00:26:58,900 --> 00:27:04,500
We have played at probably over 60 videos of this great land of ours all across the nation.

548
00:27:04,500 --> 00:27:10,660
We have never been gifted venue-specific name tags backstage in our dressing room.

549
00:27:10,660 --> 00:27:14,260
There's this name tag that says Justin on it, which I think is very nice.

550
00:27:14,260 --> 00:27:21,620
And we all three decided we would wear them as kind of like a fun bit of whimsy.

551
00:27:21,620 --> 00:27:24,260
Now, we do have to clean up afterwards.

552
00:27:24,260 --> 00:27:27,700
So please take your trash out with you.

553
00:27:27,700 --> 00:27:29,060
How about a new question?

554
00:27:29,060 --> 00:27:39,940
Yeah, here's one, let's get right the fuck into it.

555
00:27:39,940 --> 00:27:43,220
You do get the doll in this listing.

556
00:27:46,740 --> 00:27:48,420
It's a haunted doll watch, folks.

557
00:27:48,420 --> 00:27:50,740
You do get the doll in this listing, all caps.

558
00:27:50,740 --> 00:27:54,100
How has there ever been confusion about that ever?

559
00:27:55,620 --> 00:27:56,180
You'll see.

560
00:27:56,900 --> 00:27:58,500
You do get the doll in this listing.

561
00:27:58,500 --> 00:28:02,820
You get in your possession this spiritual doll vessel from our dead zone.

562
00:28:03,620 --> 00:28:11,860
And then it says, in quotes, Stacey is not a toy for children to play with, end quote.

563
00:28:11,860 --> 00:28:15,140
Which as far as toy slogans go, is the worst one.

564
00:28:16,260 --> 00:28:21,060
Stacey's not a toy for children to play with, by Hasbro.

565
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:25,940
We are not responsible for the activity or actions of this doll once it is in your hands

566
00:28:25,940 --> 00:28:29,780
and due to eBay rules, I must post this.

567
00:28:31,220 --> 00:28:35,060
All paranormal dolls and stories are for entertainment purposes only.

568
00:28:35,780 --> 00:28:39,460
And they don't have a giant wink here, but like, wink.

569
00:28:39,460 --> 00:28:41,300
Wait, does it really have a wink?

570
00:28:41,300 --> 00:28:42,420
No, they don't have a giant wink.

571
00:28:42,420 --> 00:28:43,380
Fuck, you've got me again.

572
00:28:44,020 --> 00:28:45,460
Justin, can I ask you a question?

573
00:28:45,460 --> 00:28:46,820
Just a little spoiler alert.

574
00:28:46,820 --> 00:28:47,540
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

575
00:28:47,540 --> 00:28:50,820
Do they ever go on to explain what the dead zone is?

576
00:28:50,820 --> 00:28:52,020
No, sir, maybe.

577
00:28:52,020 --> 00:28:53,860
We have way, like I read all these.

578
00:28:53,860 --> 00:28:59,300
We have way over 1,450 spirit dolls here in my home.

579
00:28:59,300 --> 00:29:00,180
That's too many.

580
00:29:02,900 --> 00:29:03,860
Too many.

581
00:29:03,860 --> 00:29:06,580
But how far is way more?

582
00:29:06,580 --> 00:29:06,900
Way more.

583
00:29:06,900 --> 00:29:08,740
We're now going into 1,500.

584
00:29:08,740 --> 00:29:10,260
Six, more than six.

585
00:29:10,820 --> 00:29:15,060
We are having way too much paranormal activity in our home,

586
00:29:15,060 --> 00:29:18,820
so I must pass some of these spiritual dolls onto others

587
00:29:18,820 --> 00:29:21,700
that will take care of them and give them a great new home.

588
00:29:21,700 --> 00:29:24,660
Sounds like you have 1,450 reasons

589
00:29:24,660 --> 00:29:28,580
why you can't be too choosy about where the dolls end up, huh?

590
00:29:29,460 --> 00:29:32,420
Maybe they don't need to pay just any other home other than yours.

591
00:29:33,380 --> 00:29:38,100
I am one of the first that started listing spiritual items here on eBay.

592
00:29:38,100 --> 00:29:39,940
That's right, an OG.

593
00:29:40,580 --> 00:29:44,500
I am one that you can trust to get the real thing.

594
00:29:45,140 --> 00:29:46,100
My shit is good.

595
00:29:48,260 --> 00:29:50,900
Please feel free to check out all my feedback.

596
00:29:50,900 --> 00:29:54,020
You will get this spooky spiritual doll named Stacy.

597
00:29:54,020 --> 00:29:55,700
She is one of my favorite.

598
00:29:55,700 --> 00:30:00,020
All caps, the Ouija board and rocking chair is not included.

599
00:30:04,740 --> 00:30:05,940
Look at the picture.

600
00:30:05,940 --> 00:30:07,460
Enjoy the picture.

601
00:30:07,460 --> 00:30:10,420
Make peace with the fact that the Ouija board and rocking chair

602
00:30:11,380 --> 00:30:14,180
will not come to your home.

603
00:30:14,180 --> 00:30:15,780
Does the doll come with it, though?

604
00:30:17,220 --> 00:30:20,740
Stacy, you do get the doll.

605
00:30:20,740 --> 00:30:21,700
In this listing.

606
00:30:22,740 --> 00:30:25,140
Hi, let me introduce myself to you.

607
00:30:25,700 --> 00:30:26,660
Damn, Terry.

608
00:30:26,660 --> 00:30:27,860
That's her name, Terry.

609
00:30:27,860 --> 00:30:29,460
That was quite a preamble, eh?

610
00:30:32,020 --> 00:30:34,100
Ah, I've gotten ahead of myself.

611
00:30:34,100 --> 00:30:34,580
Allow me.

612
00:30:37,140 --> 00:30:38,420
A thousand apologies.

613
00:30:40,260 --> 00:30:41,060
I am Terry.

614
00:30:41,060 --> 00:30:42,100
Where are my manners?

615
00:30:42,100 --> 00:30:43,620
Oh, but where are my manners?

616
00:30:43,620 --> 00:30:45,860
I've rambled on too long once again.

617
00:30:45,860 --> 00:30:46,580
Have a seat.

618
00:30:46,580 --> 00:30:47,460
Enjoy the tea.

619
00:30:47,460 --> 00:30:49,780
Of course, my name is Terry

620
00:30:49,780 --> 00:30:51,780
and I'm a paranormal investigator.

621
00:30:52,500 --> 00:30:54,980
You can call me a terra-normal investigator.

622
00:30:59,700 --> 00:31:04,500
I've been collecting spiritual dolls and items for over 35 years.

623
00:31:04,500 --> 00:31:07,140
I travel to many different areas in the United States

624
00:31:07,140 --> 00:31:10,020
in search of paranormal items and activities.

625
00:31:10,020 --> 00:31:12,580
People on here are always asking me

626
00:31:12,580 --> 00:31:15,220
how do I have so many spiritual dolls to sell here on eBay?

627
00:31:16,340 --> 00:31:18,580
So I thought I would give you all some background on me.

628
00:31:18,580 --> 00:31:22,420
I also live by a very old and large cemetery

629
00:31:22,420 --> 00:31:23,860
that backs up to my home.

630
00:31:23,860 --> 00:31:24,500
Of course.

631
00:31:24,500 --> 00:31:25,860
She brings the dolls.

632
00:31:25,860 --> 00:31:27,220
She's cutting out the middle bit.

633
00:31:27,220 --> 00:31:28,420
Bring the dolls directly to you.

634
00:31:29,620 --> 00:31:31,780
So I have no problem attracting spirits and entities

635
00:31:31,780 --> 00:31:33,940
to attach themselves to my items.

636
00:31:33,940 --> 00:31:36,180
Okay, enough about me.

637
00:31:36,180 --> 00:31:38,820
Now let's get to the spiritual item here up for bid.

638
00:31:38,820 --> 00:31:42,660
Stacy the Haunted Doll is not a toy to play with.

639
00:31:42,660 --> 00:31:45,060
Says it again, this time in all caps.

640
00:31:45,620 --> 00:31:47,140
I don't want you to get it twisted.

641
00:31:47,140 --> 00:31:48,180
Stacy is not to play with.

642
00:31:48,180 --> 00:31:50,660
And then right after that, I'm shit you not,

643
00:31:50,660 --> 00:31:52,180
it says in all caps,

644
00:31:52,180 --> 00:31:56,260
the Ouija board and rocking chair is not included.

645
00:31:59,300 --> 00:32:02,020
If you really want to have some fun with a spiritual haunted doll,

646
00:32:02,020 --> 00:32:03,460
here is Stacy.

647
00:32:03,460 --> 00:32:05,940
Wait, you just said it's not a toy to fucking play with.

648
00:32:06,820 --> 00:32:09,620
No, like a doll fun, like watching Jeopardy together.

649
00:32:09,620 --> 00:32:10,020
Yeah.

650
00:32:10,020 --> 00:32:11,380
Oh, I enjoy this.

651
00:32:11,380 --> 00:32:14,660
Here's spiritual haunted doll vessel.

652
00:32:14,660 --> 00:32:18,340
She is a very old soft like plastic doll.

653
00:32:18,340 --> 00:32:21,940
Soft like, what's that thing that's like soft,

654
00:32:21,940 --> 00:32:23,620
but not all right, nothing.

655
00:32:24,820 --> 00:32:28,020
She is one of my spookiest spiritual vessel I have.

656
00:32:28,020 --> 00:32:30,740
Stacy gets really active around nighttime.

657
00:32:30,740 --> 00:32:33,460
She has the most spookiest eyes I've ever seen

658
00:32:33,460 --> 00:32:35,220
in any haunted doll vessel ever.

659
00:32:35,220 --> 00:32:36,580
They are so tantalizing.

660
00:32:36,580 --> 00:32:41,220
Oops, oops, oops, oops, whoops.

661
00:32:41,220 --> 00:32:41,940
Not the word.

662
00:32:41,940 --> 00:32:42,740
Ah, no.

663
00:32:42,740 --> 00:32:45,940
Violet blue looking as though she is looking inside you.

664
00:32:45,940 --> 00:32:46,500
No, thanks.

665
00:32:47,060 --> 00:32:47,380
Yeah.

666
00:32:48,420 --> 00:32:50,820
You can just feel her presence all around you.

667
00:32:51,700 --> 00:32:53,700
I've never seen eyes like this.

668
00:32:53,700 --> 00:32:55,140
Your voice is getting a little too.

669
00:32:55,140 --> 00:32:56,180
Yeah, it's a little husky.

670
00:32:58,340 --> 00:33:01,780
She's a very active spiritual 24 inches long,

671
00:33:01,780 --> 00:33:03,300
spooky haunted doll vessel.

672
00:33:04,020 --> 00:33:05,860
If the doll, I've said it before,

673
00:33:05,860 --> 00:33:07,060
if the doll is haunted,

674
00:33:07,620 --> 00:33:10,500
what the fuck does it matter how tall it is?

675
00:33:10,500 --> 00:33:16,020
Like, do you have a 22 and a 25 and a 23 and a 26?

676
00:33:16,020 --> 00:33:17,460
And man alive.

677
00:33:17,460 --> 00:33:20,420
If you could get one very haunted 24 inch doll,

678
00:33:20,420 --> 00:33:21,380
you'd just be set.

679
00:33:21,380 --> 00:33:23,140
You could play doll xylophone.

680
00:33:23,140 --> 00:33:26,900
You need to know the height so you know your chances

681
00:33:26,900 --> 00:33:28,980
when it comes alive to try to kill you.

682
00:33:30,180 --> 00:33:31,700
Could you punt this doll?

683
00:33:31,700 --> 00:33:34,500
24 inches, I could get out the window.

684
00:33:34,500 --> 00:33:40,020
It goes on like this for many pages.

685
00:33:41,140 --> 00:33:43,860
Let's circle back up at the end together.

686
00:33:43,860 --> 00:33:46,660
Stacey will bring you lots of company to your home.

687
00:33:46,660 --> 00:33:49,380
She is one spirit vessel you will love to watch.

688
00:33:49,380 --> 00:33:52,100
She will do many things to let you know she's around you,

689
00:33:52,100 --> 00:33:53,460
like opening and closing doors,

690
00:33:53,460 --> 00:33:54,340
whispering in your ear.

691
00:33:54,340 --> 00:33:56,100
No, you will hear bumps in the night.

692
00:33:56,100 --> 00:33:56,740
No, thanks.

693
00:33:56,740 --> 00:33:58,020
She will come to you in your dreams.

694
00:33:58,020 --> 00:34:00,260
Okay, so keep your mind clear

695
00:34:00,260 --> 00:34:02,340
and she will communicate this way with you as well.

696
00:34:02,340 --> 00:34:05,460
But do not worry, it is only Stacey watching you.

697
00:34:05,460 --> 00:34:07,300
Please leave your feedback for me

698
00:34:07,300 --> 00:34:10,500
and tell me what all of you have seen her do around you.

699
00:34:10,500 --> 00:34:12,740
And I will put it in my ads if that's okay with you.

700
00:34:14,740 --> 00:34:17,460
Here are a few feedbacks from some of my buyers.

701
00:34:18,980 --> 00:34:22,020
Already active, very sweet, excellent seller.

702
00:34:22,020 --> 00:34:23,220
Fully recommend, thank you.

703
00:34:24,580 --> 00:34:26,980
I am so happy with this great seller, an angel.

704
00:34:27,700 --> 00:34:29,060
I am already a repeat customer.

705
00:34:29,060 --> 00:34:30,900
The dollar, the seller.

706
00:34:30,900 --> 00:34:33,460
The dollar, the seller, it's just so different ways.

707
00:34:34,660 --> 00:34:35,940
Received my doll today.

708
00:34:35,940 --> 00:34:37,220
Thanks for the speedy shipping.

709
00:34:37,220 --> 00:34:38,260
She is really cute.

710
00:34:38,900 --> 00:34:40,100
This doll is haunted.

711
00:34:40,100 --> 00:34:41,700
It better not get here after Thursday.

712
00:34:43,380 --> 00:34:45,220
I'm really in the mood for it right now.

713
00:34:45,860 --> 00:34:47,940
I really hope it gets here before Thursday.

714
00:34:49,620 --> 00:34:50,900
I love Billy the doll.

715
00:34:50,900 --> 00:34:51,700
He is cute.

716
00:34:51,700 --> 00:34:52,740
Thank you very much.

717
00:34:52,740 --> 00:34:53,940
Great seller, A++++.

718
00:34:54,980 --> 00:34:55,860
Wonderful seller.

719
00:34:55,860 --> 00:34:58,980
I love this cute little clown dolls, Spot and Pat.

720
00:34:58,980 --> 00:35:01,300
Thank you, A++++.

721
00:35:01,300 --> 00:35:03,140
Big Bo, he's so cute.

722
00:35:03,140 --> 00:35:04,180
Perfect seller.

723
00:35:04,180 --> 00:35:05,300
He will be loved.

724
00:35:06,980 --> 00:35:09,780
And then it closes out by saying the Ouija board

725
00:35:09,780 --> 00:35:12,500
and the rocking chair are not included.

726
00:35:12,500 --> 00:35:14,500
A third time I shit you that.

727
00:35:14,500 --> 00:35:15,700
There's your $100 watch.

728
00:35:20,580 --> 00:35:24,020
My very favorite part of that is the part where she said,

729
00:35:25,460 --> 00:35:27,060
my house backs up to a graveyard.

730
00:35:27,060 --> 00:35:29,380
So I get all the spirits and ghouls from there.

731
00:35:30,180 --> 00:35:31,860
That doesn't seem like a cool place

732
00:35:31,860 --> 00:35:34,500
to get your spirits for your dolls.

733
00:35:34,500 --> 00:35:35,940
Because if like a little kid goes,

734
00:35:35,940 --> 00:35:37,860
he's like time to visit grandpa's ghost.

735
00:35:37,860 --> 00:35:39,780
Wait a minute, where grandpa's ghost go?

736
00:35:39,780 --> 00:35:43,140
And you find out the fucking like ghost type Pokemon trainer

737
00:35:43,140 --> 00:35:44,900
that lives in the house next to the cemetery

738
00:35:44,900 --> 00:35:46,580
just captured his spirit in a doll.

739
00:35:48,660 --> 00:35:49,620
That stinks.

740
00:35:49,620 --> 00:35:51,620
I also really like the part where it says

741
00:35:51,620 --> 00:35:53,380
that the ghost will whisper in your ear

742
00:35:53,380 --> 00:35:54,820
to let you know it's there

743
00:35:54,820 --> 00:35:57,140
as if a doll crawling up to your ear

744
00:35:57,140 --> 00:35:59,860
isn't a clear indication like, hey, lean over.

745
00:36:02,900 --> 00:36:03,860
How about, do you wanna read it?

746
00:36:03,860 --> 00:36:05,300
You close your iPad.

747
00:36:05,300 --> 00:36:06,020
Yeah, I'm done.

748
00:36:06,020 --> 00:36:07,140
All right, I'll do a Yahoo.

749
00:36:08,580 --> 00:36:09,860
There's 25 minutes left.

750
00:36:09,860 --> 00:36:10,900
Yeah, here's a Yahoo.

751
00:36:10,900 --> 00:36:11,700
Hit me.

752
00:36:11,700 --> 00:36:16,500
This Yahoo was sent in by Andrew who sent it in.

753
00:36:16,500 --> 00:36:17,140
He didn't ask it.

754
00:36:17,140 --> 00:36:18,980
It's from an anonymous Yahoo answers user,

755
00:36:18,980 --> 00:36:24,180
but I'll say it's from Dennis asks,

756
00:36:24,180 --> 00:36:27,220
what is some good, strong fighting food?

757
00:36:29,860 --> 00:36:32,820
Obviously like sausage links in a chain.

758
00:36:34,340 --> 00:36:35,140
Nunchucks.

759
00:36:35,140 --> 00:36:37,540
Oh, like nunchucks, very good.

760
00:36:37,540 --> 00:36:39,700
Do you remember in Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles 2

761
00:36:39,700 --> 00:36:42,260
when Michelangelo had the sausage links on a chain

762
00:36:42,740 --> 00:36:46,100
and Leonardo had the large sausage link

763
00:36:46,100 --> 00:36:47,460
that was like a katana?

764
00:36:47,460 --> 00:36:47,940
Uh-huh.

765
00:36:47,940 --> 00:36:51,620
And Donatello had the very, very long sausage link.

766
00:36:51,620 --> 00:36:52,740
It was like a bo staff.

767
00:36:52,740 --> 00:36:53,700
Like who made that one?

768
00:36:53,700 --> 00:36:54,820
It was his first day.

769
00:36:54,820 --> 00:36:57,300
And Raphael had the two sausage links

770
00:36:57,300 --> 00:36:59,140
with smaller ones sticking out.

771
00:36:59,140 --> 00:36:59,780
Yeah.

772
00:36:59,780 --> 00:37:00,740
They all had sausage links.

773
00:37:00,740 --> 00:37:02,020
You know the second Ninja Turtles movie,

774
00:37:02,020 --> 00:37:03,140
they weren't allowed to have weapons,

775
00:37:03,140 --> 00:37:04,340
so they all used sausage.

776
00:37:04,340 --> 00:37:05,140
Yeah, I remember.

777
00:37:05,140 --> 00:37:05,780
You remember.

778
00:37:05,780 --> 00:37:06,260
You remember.

779
00:37:06,980 --> 00:37:09,300
Yeah, they still kill Treader Good with them though, huh?

780
00:37:10,740 --> 00:37:11,460
Took a while.

781
00:37:11,460 --> 00:37:12,740
He's meat-testing tolerance.

782
00:37:14,980 --> 00:37:15,460
One more time.

783
00:37:15,460 --> 00:37:16,420
Check out Paul.

784
00:37:17,460 --> 00:37:18,340
He's meat-testing.

785
00:37:19,380 --> 00:37:21,140
Sorry, you got to say it without laughing, my friend.

786
00:37:24,260 --> 00:37:26,740
He's meat-testing intolerant, okay?

787
00:37:28,500 --> 00:37:30,580
There, I've said it three times now.

788
00:37:30,580 --> 00:37:32,020
Are you fucking happy?

789
00:37:32,020 --> 00:37:32,820
I'm not.

790
00:37:32,820 --> 00:37:34,580
I put up an air ball

791
00:37:34,580 --> 00:37:36,260
and then I had to go pick up the air ball

792
00:37:36,260 --> 00:37:38,340
out of the creek that it rolled into

793
00:37:38,340 --> 00:37:40,500
and shoot it again, an air ball again,

794
00:37:40,500 --> 00:37:42,660
and get it out of a deeper creek

795
00:37:42,660 --> 00:37:44,740
and then bring it back and shoot it again.

796
00:37:44,740 --> 00:37:45,380
Are you happy?

797
00:37:46,580 --> 00:37:46,900
Nah.

798
00:37:50,180 --> 00:37:52,260
What is some good, strong fighting food?

799
00:37:53,060 --> 00:37:55,460
I have an opponent I need to hurt today

800
00:37:55,460 --> 00:37:58,580
and I need to fill my body with food strength.

801
00:37:59,540 --> 00:38:00,580
What's that going to be?

802
00:38:01,780 --> 00:38:06,020
Carbs, prot, put a lot of one of those two in you

803
00:38:06,020 --> 00:38:08,020
and I guess you're ready to roll.

804
00:38:08,740 --> 00:38:11,060
Eat a lot of spicy food, transform into a car.

805
00:38:11,700 --> 00:38:12,740
Yeah, we did it.

806
00:38:12,740 --> 00:38:14,500
That's our 2018 reference.

807
00:38:14,500 --> 00:38:16,740
Oh shit, yeah, we almost made it through the year

808
00:38:16,740 --> 00:38:18,100
without a Turbo Teen reference.

809
00:38:18,100 --> 00:38:21,780
I would say like those really thin breadsticks

810
00:38:21,780 --> 00:38:22,980
that you can bite and like crunch,

811
00:38:22,980 --> 00:38:23,940
that feels dramatic.

812
00:38:24,500 --> 00:38:27,380
You know, you bite like a bone of your enemy.

813
00:38:27,380 --> 00:38:28,260
Like you're eating.

814
00:38:28,260 --> 00:38:30,100
Oh, so you're like LARPing a bone eat.

815
00:38:31,620 --> 00:38:33,620
Yeah, you could also do it like with a carrot,

816
00:38:33,620 --> 00:38:34,980
anything you could snap.

817
00:38:34,980 --> 00:38:36,420
Plus you could probably eat a lot of them

818
00:38:36,420 --> 00:38:37,860
so that feels like an accomplishment

819
00:38:37,860 --> 00:38:39,460
which will help you get pumped.

820
00:38:39,460 --> 00:38:40,980
I ate 28 of these, hell yeah.

821
00:38:40,980 --> 00:38:44,020
Yeah, conventional wisdom is load up on carb,

822
00:38:44,020 --> 00:38:45,620
load up on prot, one of the two,

823
00:38:45,620 --> 00:38:46,900
but that's all that you get

824
00:38:46,900 --> 00:38:49,780
is one of those two raw food elements.

825
00:38:49,780 --> 00:38:53,300
But what if actually doing a balanced diet,

826
00:38:53,300 --> 00:38:55,300
what if the food pyramid was designed

827
00:38:55,300 --> 00:38:57,300
to optimize your fighting energy?

828
00:38:59,620 --> 00:39:00,340
That's it.

829
00:39:00,340 --> 00:39:04,420
A lot of people don't know that the food pyramid

830
00:39:04,420 --> 00:39:07,460
was actually designed sequentially for fights.

831
00:39:07,460 --> 00:39:08,660
So you wake up in the morning,

832
00:39:08,660 --> 00:39:10,340
you eat 11 servings of grain.

833
00:39:10,340 --> 00:39:11,540
Sure.

834
00:39:11,540 --> 00:39:15,140
Mid-morning, eight grains of vegetables or fruits.

835
00:39:15,780 --> 00:39:18,100
And then by the time you get to the pinnacle,

836
00:39:18,100 --> 00:39:19,060
the butter pinnacle,

837
00:39:20,020 --> 00:39:22,580
and you eat that little triangle of butter,

838
00:39:22,580 --> 00:39:24,260
you are gonna be so ready to kick some ass

839
00:39:24,260 --> 00:39:26,420
this time it's gonna be remotely fair.

840
00:39:26,420 --> 00:39:27,460
That makes so much sense.

841
00:39:27,460 --> 00:39:29,620
That's why in Rocky as he runs up the steps,

842
00:39:29,620 --> 00:39:31,940
he's eating some bread and then he's eating a steak,

843
00:39:31,940 --> 00:39:32,900
then he's eating an apple,

844
00:39:32,900 --> 00:39:34,740
then he's just eating a stick of butter at the top.

845
00:39:34,740 --> 00:39:35,700
Yeah, that's right.

846
00:39:36,500 --> 00:39:37,460
And he loses so.

847
00:39:37,460 --> 00:39:38,740
Spoilers.

848
00:39:38,740 --> 00:39:42,580
Maybe not that good a pyramid.

849
00:39:43,540 --> 00:39:46,020
How'd they fuck that up so bad?

850
00:39:46,020 --> 00:39:48,420
How did we go from like probably the thing

851
00:39:48,420 --> 00:39:50,500
you should eat the most of is bread

852
00:39:50,500 --> 00:39:52,900
to like don't eat bread.

853
00:39:54,260 --> 00:39:55,620
What are you kidding?

854
00:39:55,620 --> 00:39:57,220
All right, we tried bread for a while.

855
00:39:57,220 --> 00:39:57,540
No, no, no, no.

856
00:39:57,540 --> 00:40:00,980
We tried a lot of bread to make sure it was bad for us.

857
00:40:02,020 --> 00:40:04,100
Maybe have a bunch of tortilla chips.

858
00:40:04,100 --> 00:40:05,460
I don't know.

859
00:40:05,460 --> 00:40:07,300
I think a good strong fighting food would be

860
00:40:07,300 --> 00:40:07,940
your enemy.

861
00:40:09,220 --> 00:40:11,060
Okay, like Kirby.

862
00:40:11,060 --> 00:40:11,860
Yeah, sure.

863
00:40:11,860 --> 00:40:13,780
Yeah, we're gonna talk about Kirby a little bit more.

864
00:40:13,780 --> 00:40:14,820
This is entrapment.

865
00:40:16,500 --> 00:40:18,180
Is there any way I can make the people

866
00:40:18,180 --> 00:40:20,900
I stab legally like me more?

867
00:40:21,700 --> 00:40:22,820
I'm a phlebotomist.

868
00:40:23,860 --> 00:40:25,060
Oh, you had it.

869
00:40:25,060 --> 00:40:27,860
I'm a phlebotomist and I work drawing blood

870
00:40:27,860 --> 00:40:29,060
from adults and children.

871
00:40:29,060 --> 00:40:31,140
Naturally, this does not make me very popular.

872
00:40:31,140 --> 00:40:32,340
So is there anything I could do

873
00:40:32,340 --> 00:40:34,260
to make the people I stab hate me less?

874
00:40:34,260 --> 00:40:38,100
And that's from the vampire link in row C.

875
00:40:38,100 --> 00:40:38,660
Are you here?

876
00:40:39,540 --> 00:40:39,860
Hello.

877
00:40:39,860 --> 00:40:40,580
Okay.

878
00:40:40,580 --> 00:40:42,340
Hey, it's gonna be all right.

879
00:40:42,340 --> 00:40:42,660
Okay.

880
00:40:43,460 --> 00:40:44,980
Here's my suggestion.

881
00:40:44,980 --> 00:40:46,660
Let them draw blood from you.

882
00:40:47,460 --> 00:40:48,020
Very good.

883
00:40:48,740 --> 00:40:50,580
So you say I'll draw blood from you

884
00:40:50,580 --> 00:40:52,100
and then you draw blood from me and what?

885
00:40:52,100 --> 00:40:52,820
Oh shit.

886
00:40:54,260 --> 00:40:54,900
This will be good.

887
00:40:54,900 --> 00:40:55,380
Calm down.

888
00:40:55,380 --> 00:40:56,020
You'll see it doesn't.

889
00:40:56,020 --> 00:40:57,540
No, left, left, left, left.

890
00:40:57,540 --> 00:40:58,740
Oh god, left.

891
00:40:59,940 --> 00:41:01,060
My bone.

892
00:41:01,060 --> 00:41:02,180
My arm bone.

893
00:41:02,180 --> 00:41:06,820
I should really know what it's called.

894
00:41:06,820 --> 00:41:07,380
Phibia?

895
00:41:16,740 --> 00:41:18,900
Maybe because phibia is not a bone.

896
00:41:20,900 --> 00:41:23,620
Well, tomato, tomato.

897
00:41:23,620 --> 00:41:25,380
Listen, there's like 800 bones in there.

898
00:41:25,380 --> 00:41:27,220
You're telling me there's not a chance

899
00:41:27,220 --> 00:41:30,660
that there's at least one bone we haven't found yet.

900
00:41:30,660 --> 00:41:34,980
Yeah, here's what I would do.

901
00:41:36,340 --> 00:41:38,420
Hunch over at your desk and when they come in

902
00:41:38,420 --> 00:41:41,220
be like writing on your desk

903
00:41:41,220 --> 00:41:43,860
and like hunched over and not even looking at them.

904
00:41:43,860 --> 00:41:47,060
And they're like, I'm here to get my blood.

905
00:41:47,060 --> 00:41:48,900
And you just turn around like, good day.

906
00:41:50,420 --> 00:41:51,780
And then go back to scratching.

907
00:41:51,780 --> 00:41:54,020
And they're like, no, I just really need to.

908
00:41:54,020 --> 00:41:55,140
I said good day.

909
00:41:55,860 --> 00:41:57,540
No more blood drawn today.

910
00:41:58,180 --> 00:41:59,460
And then keep scratching.

911
00:41:59,460 --> 00:42:02,500
And then eventually they will beg you.

912
00:42:04,180 --> 00:42:04,660
Please.

913
00:42:05,300 --> 00:42:06,980
I want to do anything else.

914
00:42:08,020 --> 00:42:09,300
Please take the blood.

915
00:42:09,860 --> 00:42:10,980
I just want to go.

916
00:42:10,980 --> 00:42:12,340
And I don't know what's happening.

917
00:42:12,340 --> 00:42:14,180
It's kind of a Willy Wonka thing.

918
00:42:14,180 --> 00:42:14,580
Sure.

919
00:42:14,580 --> 00:42:16,820
And then you reward them with the whole clinic.

920
00:42:16,820 --> 00:42:17,620
And then you're like.

921
00:42:18,900 --> 00:42:21,140
I want to walk over and leave a small bag

922
00:42:21,140 --> 00:42:23,140
of their own blood on your desk first

923
00:42:23,140 --> 00:42:23,940
and then walk away.

924
00:42:23,940 --> 00:42:26,660
An adult would want to steal blood their way.

925
00:42:26,660 --> 00:42:28,340
Your grandpa's there and he's like, don't worry.

926
00:42:28,340 --> 00:42:30,660
We'll sell your blood to the plasma place on the corner

927
00:42:30,660 --> 00:42:31,380
and get you $30.

928
00:42:32,020 --> 00:42:33,700
We'll get you some cheap beer.

929
00:42:35,540 --> 00:42:38,980
Maybe what you do is you put a like really bendy

930
00:42:38,980 --> 00:42:41,300
like rubber needle in the syringe.

931
00:42:41,300 --> 00:42:43,220
And then when you go to take their blood,

932
00:42:43,220 --> 00:42:44,580
it just bends and you go.

933
00:42:47,540 --> 00:42:48,260
Unbreakable.

934
00:42:49,300 --> 00:42:51,380
But then with that, oh, and their other arm,

935
00:42:51,380 --> 00:42:52,340
you've already drawn the blood.

936
00:42:54,260 --> 00:42:57,620
They're so busy like, oh, they didn't even see it over here.

937
00:42:57,620 --> 00:42:58,500
That's good.

938
00:42:58,500 --> 00:42:59,140
That's good.

939
00:42:59,140 --> 00:43:01,060
Maybe when you stand up to take the blood,

940
00:43:01,060 --> 00:43:03,940
your pants rip and your pants rip

941
00:43:03,940 --> 00:43:05,780
and then they can see your underwear and everything

942
00:43:05,780 --> 00:43:07,140
and they're like laughing at it.

943
00:43:07,140 --> 00:43:08,500
But then what's that?

944
00:43:08,500 --> 00:43:09,780
You already got the blood.

945
00:43:09,780 --> 00:43:10,740
You already got the blood.

946
00:43:10,740 --> 00:43:13,220
A local phlebotomist was arrested tonight

947
00:43:13,220 --> 00:43:17,620
after consecutively showing 158 patients

948
00:43:17,620 --> 00:43:20,100
their underwear and everything.

949
00:43:20,100 --> 00:43:22,980
Thanks to a recommendation on Comedie Podcast.

950
00:43:22,980 --> 00:43:24,260
My brother, my brother and me.

951
00:43:25,140 --> 00:43:26,660
Did you say Comedie?

952
00:43:26,660 --> 00:43:30,340
Yeah, the news, the newscaster has never heard of comedy.

953
00:43:33,540 --> 00:43:35,860
Comedie Del Arte Podcast.

954
00:43:35,860 --> 00:43:37,300
My brother, my brother and me.

955
00:43:37,300 --> 00:43:39,060
They do something called jokes.

956
00:43:41,140 --> 00:43:41,620
Jokes.

957
00:43:53,300 --> 00:43:53,940
Hey, what's up?

958
00:43:53,940 --> 00:43:56,180
This is Griffin and it's just me this time.

959
00:43:56,180 --> 00:44:00,980
And that's because it's been a fucking heck of a week, y'all.

960
00:44:00,980 --> 00:44:04,820
And I'm just going to do all the normal middle stuff

961
00:44:04,820 --> 00:44:06,100
and let you get back to the rest of the show.

962
00:44:06,100 --> 00:44:06,980
I hope you enjoyed it.

963
00:44:06,980 --> 00:44:09,060
We had a lot of fun in Orlando and Atlanta.

964
00:44:10,020 --> 00:44:13,460
Atlanta, we ran into some tech issues with the recording

965
00:44:14,100 --> 00:44:19,140
because your city and its relationship to us

966
00:44:19,140 --> 00:44:22,420
as a recorded broadcast medium is cursed.

967
00:44:22,420 --> 00:44:23,700
But we'll try and get that figured out

968
00:44:23,700 --> 00:44:25,380
because that episode was a lot of fun too.

969
00:44:25,380 --> 00:44:27,540
But I hope you're enjoying this Orlando one.

970
00:44:27,540 --> 00:44:29,780
And here are the ads.

971
00:44:29,780 --> 00:44:31,700
First off, I want to tell you about Casper.

972
00:44:31,700 --> 00:44:32,740
Casper's so good.

973
00:44:32,740 --> 00:44:34,980
They make these really nice mattresses

974
00:44:34,980 --> 00:44:37,140
that feel good on your body.

975
00:44:37,140 --> 00:44:40,420
And they are affordable because they cut out the middleman

976
00:44:40,420 --> 00:44:42,340
and they sell directly to you.

977
00:44:42,340 --> 00:44:45,380
There is no middleman anywhere.

978
00:44:45,380 --> 00:44:48,580
Certainly not hiding inside the mattress when you open it up

979
00:44:48,580 --> 00:44:50,980
because they would die in the small box

980
00:44:50,980 --> 00:44:53,780
that they ship the Casper to you in.

981
00:44:53,780 --> 00:44:55,380
And Casper's really comfy.

982
00:44:55,380 --> 00:44:56,500
We have one in our guest room

983
00:44:56,500 --> 00:44:58,100
and every time we have guests that stay with us,

984
00:44:58,100 --> 00:45:00,580
they shower us with compliments,

985
00:45:00,580 --> 00:45:02,500
which always feels so good.

986
00:45:02,500 --> 00:45:04,660
They combine multiple supportive memory foams

987
00:45:04,660 --> 00:45:06,900
for a quality sleep surface with the right amount of sink

988
00:45:06,900 --> 00:45:08,180
and the right amount of bounce.

989
00:45:08,180 --> 00:45:09,700
You can be sure of your purchase

990
00:45:09,700 --> 00:45:12,180
with Casper's 100 night risk-free sleep on trial.

991
00:45:12,180 --> 00:45:15,300
So I want you to get $50 towards select mattresses right now

Hey, stamps are necessary.

998
00:45:26,420 --> 00:45:28,180
They're mandatory in a lot of ways

999
00:45:28,180 --> 00:45:31,940
and sometimes it can be kind of a hassle to go get them.

1000
00:45:31,940 --> 00:45:34,660
These days you can get practically everything on demand

1001
00:45:34,660 --> 00:45:36,420

00:45:56,100 --> 00:45:57,460

that's stamps.com, enter my brother.

1020
00:46:14,580 --> 00:46:15,620
Got a few jumbotrons here.

1021
00:46:15,620 --> 00:46:18,900
This one's for Mary and it's from Thomas who says,

1022
00:46:18,900 --> 00:46:21,060
to my sweet, sweet girl, happy anniversary.

1023
00:46:21,060 --> 00:46:23,620
Sorry, this message is a little after September 4th.

1024
00:46:23,620 --> 00:46:24,340
Is it though?

1025
00:46:24,900 --> 00:46:26,260
Slam dunk the funk.

1026
00:46:26,900 --> 00:46:28,820
Fucking crushed it, but this will have to do.

1027
00:46:29,460 --> 00:46:32,500
I might as well wish us both happy birthdays too.

1028
00:46:32,500 --> 00:46:34,740
Every day I'm inspired and amazed by your intelligence,

1029
00:46:34,740 --> 00:46:37,380
good goofs and passion for all things McElroy.

1030
00:46:37,380 --> 00:46:39,380
So proud of you and all you've accomplished

1031
00:46:39,380 --> 00:46:40,660
and I miss you so much.

1032
00:46:40,660 --> 00:46:42,420
A sweet, sweet message and Thomas,

1033
00:46:42,420 --> 00:46:44,020
don't ever fucking doubt us again.

1034
00:46:44,020 --> 00:46:48,340
Here's a message for Starfire and it's from Blorp7 who says,

1035
00:46:48,340 --> 00:46:50,820
dear Starfire, I love you with all my heart.

1036
00:46:51,380 --> 00:46:53,300
Love, Blorp7.

1037
00:46:53,300 --> 00:46:54,180
I know you're all wondering,

1038
00:46:54,180 --> 00:46:57,380
is this part of the Bim Bam ARG, this jumbotron message?

1039
00:46:57,380 --> 00:46:59,540
And the answer is, I can't tell you.

1040
00:46:59,540 --> 00:47:00,420
It's ARG.

1041
00:47:00,420 --> 00:47:01,140
It's part of the game.

1042
00:47:01,140 --> 00:47:02,260
You gotta solve it yourself.

1043
00:47:02,260 --> 00:47:03,060
One last jumbotron.

1044
00:47:03,060 --> 00:47:03,940
This one's for Benji.

1045
00:47:03,940 --> 00:47:05,860
It's from Blairbo who says,

1046
00:47:05,860 --> 00:47:07,300
remember when we were in college,

1047
00:47:07,300 --> 00:47:08,980
smoking that good dank green?

1048
00:47:08,980 --> 00:47:10,740
That's a crime.

1049
00:47:11,460 --> 00:47:13,940
And you conditioned me Pavlovian style to cry

1050
00:47:13,940 --> 00:47:17,140
real actual tears at any picture of Full House's Dave Coulier.

1051
00:47:17,140 --> 00:47:18,260
It's a fun experiment.

1052
00:47:18,260 --> 00:47:19,780
Yeah, me too because it still happens.

1053
00:47:19,780 --> 00:47:22,020
Ben, thank you for five years of being a wonderful,

1054
00:47:22,020 --> 00:47:24,260
amazing and also very tall friend.

1055
00:47:24,260 --> 00:47:26,740
You're a whip smart, funny and so important

1056
00:47:26,740 --> 00:47:27,940
to every life you touch.

1057
00:47:27,940 --> 00:47:28,820
I love you.

1058
00:47:28,820 --> 00:47:29,460
Hell yeah.

1059
00:47:30,020 --> 00:47:33,060
Can I get a hell yeah for this sweet message

1060
00:47:33,060 --> 00:47:34,980
between two very good friends

1061
00:47:35,620 --> 00:47:40,180
and their unhealthy relationship with Uncle Joey.

1062
00:47:40,740 --> 00:47:43,140
Big thanks to everybody who came out to our live shows

1063
00:47:43,700 --> 00:47:45,300
in Orlando and Atlanta again.

1064
00:47:45,300 --> 00:47:48,100
We got actually, I think all the tickets are sold out

1065
00:47:48,100 --> 00:47:49,540
for our Portland and Seattle shows.

1066
00:47:49,540 --> 00:47:51,860
So Pacific Northwest, we are excited to come see it.

1067
00:47:51,860 --> 00:47:53,220
We're still trying to figure out

1068
00:47:53,220 --> 00:47:55,220
maybe one or two more tours this year.

1069
00:47:55,220 --> 00:47:58,340
So hopefully we will get out to see some more folks

1070
00:47:58,340 --> 00:47:59,860
before the year is up.

1071
00:47:59,860 --> 00:48:01,940
We got merch at McElroyMerch.com

1072
00:48:02,580 --> 00:48:05,940
and we just launched a new sort of project on there

1073
00:48:05,940 --> 00:48:09,140
that is not going to sound funny when I explain it,

1074
00:48:09,140 --> 00:48:10,500
but hopefully you all enjoy it.

1075
00:48:10,500 --> 00:48:14,820
It's a line of generic podcast merchandising.

1076
00:48:14,820 --> 00:48:18,180
There's a shirt on there that just says 100% podcast,

1077
00:48:18,180 --> 00:48:18,980
coffee cup that says,

1078
00:48:18,980 --> 00:48:20,980
don't talk to me before I've had my podcast.

1079
00:48:20,980 --> 00:48:24,180
Listen, we had this idea in one meeting with DFTBA,

1080
00:48:24,180 --> 00:48:25,380
our merch supplier,

1081
00:48:25,380 --> 00:48:27,860
and we all thought it was very funny and horrifyingly.

1082
00:48:27,860 --> 00:48:30,900
It went and moved through the production process

1083
00:48:30,900 --> 00:48:32,420
just so, so quickly.

1084
00:48:33,300 --> 00:48:35,220
But yeah, all of this dumb stuff

1085
00:48:35,220 --> 00:48:38,580
is on our website at McElroyMerch.com

1086
00:48:38,580 --> 00:48:41,300
and all of the royalties for this item

1087
00:48:41,300 --> 00:48:43,220
are gonna go to ProAct West Virginia,

1088
00:48:43,220 --> 00:48:47,220
which is a nonprofit designed to help with opiate addiction

1089
00:48:47,860 --> 00:48:50,180
and treatment and care in Huntington, West Virginia,

1090
00:48:50,180 --> 00:48:50,740
our hometown.

1091
00:48:50,740 --> 00:48:53,700
So it's a dumb line of products,

1092
00:48:53,700 --> 00:48:55,140
but it's for a good cause.

1093
00:48:55,140 --> 00:48:56,500
Thanks to MaxFun for having us on the network.

You can check out the other shows we do at McElroyShows.com

1100
00:49:09,460 --> 00:49:11,220
and I think that's gonna do it.

1101
00:49:11,220 --> 00:49:13,300
Yeah, here comes the rest of the episode.

1102
00:49:13,300 --> 00:49:17,220
We'll be back with a regular episode next week, I think.

1103
00:49:17,780 --> 00:49:19,460
Yes, absolutely.

1104
00:49:19,460 --> 00:49:20,180
See you then, bye.

1105
00:49:20,180 --> 00:49:24,980
Listen, we already know that you love genre movies,

1106
00:49:24,980 --> 00:49:26,900
film craft and female filmmakers.

1107
00:49:26,900 --> 00:49:28,740
So if you love all those things,

1108
00:49:28,740 --> 00:49:30,340
then by transitive property,

1109
00:49:30,340 --> 00:49:32,580
you love my podcast, Switchblade Sisters.

1110
00:49:32,580 --> 00:49:34,100
Hi, I'm film critic April Wolf.

1111
00:49:34,100 --> 00:49:35,460
Every week I have a conversation

1112
00:49:35,460 --> 00:49:36,900
with a different female filmmaker

1113
00:49:36,900 --> 00:49:38,260
about their favorite genre film.

1114
00:49:38,260 --> 00:49:40,340
Each episode covers the filmmaking process,

1115
00:49:40,340 --> 00:49:41,540
working in the film industry

1116
00:49:41,540 --> 00:49:44,500
and just like general geeking out about awesome movies.

1117
00:49:44,500 --> 00:49:45,540
I've had such great guests

1118
00:49:45,540 --> 00:49:47,300
like the big sick writer, Emily Gordon.

1119
00:49:47,300 --> 00:49:49,140
To me, indie movies as of late

1120
00:49:49,140 --> 00:49:50,900
have come to be a catch all term

1121
00:49:50,900 --> 00:49:53,220
for a movie that kind of defies genre.

1122
00:49:53,220 --> 00:49:55,700
Billy Madison and half fake director, Tamara Davis.

1123
00:49:55,700 --> 00:49:58,260
When a comedian comes and enters onto my set,

1124
00:49:58,260 --> 00:50:00,500
they're just there to be funny

1125
00:50:00,500 --> 00:50:03,140
and we're all ready and waiting for them to be funny.

1126
00:50:03,140 --> 00:50:05,700
Horror industry veteran and actor, Barbara Crampton.

1127
00:50:05,700 --> 00:50:07,700
That's where real drama lies for me.

1128
00:50:07,700 --> 00:50:11,220
What's between you and I speaking right now?

1129
00:50:11,220 --> 00:50:12,820
Where are we meeting?

1130
00:50:12,820 --> 00:50:15,140
And what's the energy that we create between us?

1131
00:50:15,140 --> 00:50:16,340
And so many others.

1132
00:50:16,340 --> 00:50:17,780
So check out Switchblade Sisters

1133
00:50:17,780 --> 00:50:19,780
every Thursday on maximumfun.org

1134
00:50:19,780 --> 00:50:21,540
or wherever you get your podcasts.

1135
00:50:25,380 --> 00:50:26,900
Another question or what do you guys think?

1136
00:50:26,900 --> 00:50:28,580
Let's, I think we should go to the audience.

1137
00:50:28,580 --> 00:50:31,700
Yes, we have a handful of audience questions.

1138
00:50:31,700 --> 00:50:33,060
We have chosen them ahead of time.

1139
00:50:33,060 --> 00:50:36,260
Please do not stand up unless we say your name and seat number.

1140
00:50:36,260 --> 00:50:40,100
Can we get, thank you Mickey.

1141
00:50:40,100 --> 00:50:42,900
Now we can all drink in this beautiful theater together.

1142
00:50:42,900 --> 00:50:45,380
We have a mic there in the middle, a mic there in the middle.

1143
00:50:45,940 --> 00:50:50,180
Let's go ahead and get Niel in V3.

1144
00:50:50,820 --> 00:50:52,900
Come on down to one of these two microphones

1145
00:50:52,900 --> 00:50:58,580
and let's get Em in Orchestra Center D2 row BBC 114.

1146
00:50:58,580 --> 00:50:59,140
Very specific, thank you.

1147
00:50:59,140 --> 00:51:00,420
That's so much longer than the other one.

1148
00:51:00,420 --> 00:51:02,340
I'm hoping Niel is able to know that it's them.

1149
00:51:03,220 --> 00:51:04,100
Okay, that's two.

1150
00:51:04,660 --> 00:51:05,620
Hey, what's up?

1151
00:51:05,620 --> 00:51:06,900
Hey, how's it going?

1152
00:51:06,900 --> 00:51:07,300
Good, what's your-

1153
00:51:07,300 --> 00:51:08,660
It's going good, how's it going for you?

1154
00:51:10,340 --> 00:51:11,860
My name, I go by Niel.

1155
00:51:11,860 --> 00:51:12,340
Niel?

1156
00:51:12,340 --> 00:51:12,660
Niel.

1157
00:51:12,660 --> 00:51:14,020
I fucked that up so, Niel?

1158
00:51:14,660 --> 00:51:16,020
Well, it's actually pronounced Nail

1159
00:51:16,020 --> 00:51:17,540
because it's a Middle Eastern name.

1160
00:51:17,540 --> 00:51:21,620
Okay, I mainly just want to hear the story, you know?

1161
00:51:21,620 --> 00:51:24,900
Yeah, so we're not even going to read your submission.

1162
00:51:24,900 --> 00:51:26,100
We want to hear it.

1163
00:51:26,100 --> 00:51:27,780
At first, wait, wait, wait, before we do anything

1164
00:51:27,780 --> 00:51:30,340
and if the answer to this is no,

1165
00:51:30,340 --> 00:51:32,180
I'm going to ask you to leave the theater in shame.

1166
00:51:33,780 --> 00:51:34,660
Is this true?

1167
00:51:34,660 --> 00:51:36,340
This is very true, I have a video of it.

1168
00:51:36,340 --> 00:51:36,980
Hit it.

1169
00:51:36,980 --> 00:51:37,780
Okay.

1170
00:51:37,780 --> 00:51:42,340
Okay, so yesterday Guy Fieri opened up a restaurant in-

1171
00:51:42,980 --> 00:51:43,300
Yeah.

1172
00:51:45,300 --> 00:51:48,180
He opened up a chicken tender restaurant in Disney Springs.

1173
00:51:49,060 --> 00:51:49,620
Ooh.

1174
00:51:49,620 --> 00:51:50,500
I went to the grand opening-

1175
00:51:50,500 --> 00:51:51,540
Hold on, hold on.

1176
00:51:52,340 --> 00:51:55,780
We left Disney today, you're fucking telling me this now?

1177
00:51:55,780 --> 00:52:00,580
Ow!

1178
00:52:00,580 --> 00:52:04,020
I posted it on Twitter, you don't follow me on Twitter, I'm sorry.

1179
00:52:04,980 --> 00:52:07,140
I know what the- what's the name of the restaurant?

1180
00:52:07,140 --> 00:52:08,260
It's called Chicken Guy.

1181
00:52:19,060 --> 00:52:19,860
Go on.

1182
00:52:19,860 --> 00:52:22,420
I'm livid about this misconnection right now.

1183
00:52:23,460 --> 00:52:25,700
Ew, making chicken tenders.

1184
00:52:25,700 --> 00:52:28,180
Me wanting to eat chicken tenders.

1185
00:52:28,180 --> 00:52:32,180
Me at Kilimanjaro Safari wishing that I was there

1186
00:52:32,180 --> 00:52:33,300
at your chicken tender restaurant.

1187
00:52:33,300 --> 00:52:33,940
Okay, go ahead.

1188
00:52:34,580 --> 00:52:37,140
So Guy Fieri was making chicken.

1189
00:52:37,140 --> 00:52:41,620
Yeah, so I go, it was around like noon the whole thing.

1190
00:52:41,620 --> 00:52:44,100
So they opened up the restaurant after they did their whole like

1191
00:52:44,100 --> 00:52:46,900
hullabaloo with Mickey cutting the ribbon and all that.

1192
00:52:46,900 --> 00:52:49,220
And he's like, he's behind the counter,

1193
00:52:49,220 --> 00:52:50,900
he's making the chicken tenders for everybody.

1194
00:52:51,460 --> 00:52:51,940
And eventually-

1195
00:52:51,940 --> 00:52:52,900
Guy, not Mickey.

1196
00:52:52,900 --> 00:52:56,580
No, no, Guy, yeah, Guy's making the chicken, not Mickey, sorry.

1197
00:52:56,580 --> 00:52:58,100
And eventually Guy comes out.

1198
00:52:58,100 --> 00:53:01,380
It makes me actually very nervous that Guy and Mickey were at the same place.

1199
00:53:01,380 --> 00:53:02,580
I hate that actually.

1200
00:53:02,580 --> 00:53:03,780
They're conceptually the opposite.

1201
00:53:03,780 --> 00:53:05,940
That leaves our nation so vulnerable.

1202
00:53:08,500 --> 00:53:10,420
We need a designated survivor.

1203
00:53:10,420 --> 00:53:11,060
Right?

1204
00:53:11,060 --> 00:53:12,100
Who's the designated-

1205
00:53:12,100 --> 00:53:13,220
It was Key for Sutherland.

1206
00:53:13,220 --> 00:53:13,780
Don't worry.

1207
00:53:13,780 --> 00:53:14,260
Yeah.

1208
00:53:14,820 --> 00:53:16,020
Okay, so please.

1209
00:53:16,580 --> 00:53:18,180
So I'm back at my table-

1210
00:53:18,180 --> 00:53:20,100
Ski Allrich was in a bunker.

1211
00:53:20,100 --> 00:53:20,820
Don't worry.

1212
00:53:20,820 --> 00:53:21,540
Wait, I'm sorry?

1213
00:53:21,540 --> 00:53:22,820
Don't worry.

1214
00:53:22,820 --> 00:53:26,260
Is Ski Allrich right between Mickey and Guy?

1215
00:53:26,260 --> 00:53:27,300
He's in between there.

1216
00:53:27,300 --> 00:53:27,700
Go ahead.

1217
00:53:27,700 --> 00:53:28,900
Sorry, if nobody else talk.

1218
00:53:29,620 --> 00:53:30,120
Okay.

1219
00:53:31,220 --> 00:53:32,500
So I'm back at my table with my food.

1220
00:53:32,500 --> 00:53:34,100
Eventually he comes out from behind the counter

1221
00:53:34,100 --> 00:53:38,500
to do like an in-person interview with one of the local news journalists.

1222
00:53:38,500 --> 00:53:39,380
And he's like-

1223
00:53:39,380 --> 00:53:40,340
Okay, stop again.

1224
00:53:44,660 --> 00:53:47,780
Everybody, take a second to pretend you're that journalist.

1225
00:53:47,780 --> 00:53:52,820
And try to think of your first question.

1226
00:53:56,260 --> 00:53:57,620
So Guy Fieri,

1227
00:53:57,620 --> 00:54:00,980
why did you open up a chicken to the restaurant at Walt Disney World?

1228
00:54:02,980 --> 00:54:03,480
Okay.

1229
00:54:04,260 --> 00:54:05,140
Okay, I'm done.

1230
00:54:05,140 --> 00:54:05,640
Go.

1231
00:54:06,820 --> 00:54:07,780
So they're talking,

1232
00:54:07,780 --> 00:54:09,860
maybe they're talking for like 20 minutes or so.

1233
00:54:09,860 --> 00:54:10,660
And I'm like right there.

1234
00:54:10,660 --> 00:54:11,140
I'm just like-

1235
00:54:11,140 --> 00:54:13,220
The interview goes on for 20 minutes?

1236
00:54:14,100 --> 00:54:15,620
Was it James Lipton?

1237
00:54:15,620 --> 00:54:16,420
What the fuck?

1238
00:54:16,420 --> 00:54:17,780
There's like a whole like-

1239
00:54:17,780 --> 00:54:19,220
There's a whole crowd around them.

1240
00:54:19,220 --> 00:54:20,580
There were people taking pictures.

1241
00:54:20,580 --> 00:54:21,380
It was like an event.

1242
00:54:21,380 --> 00:54:22,340
Chanting.

1243
00:54:22,340 --> 00:54:24,420
I also need to know you say you were right there.

1244
00:54:24,420 --> 00:54:26,260
Give me like a distance.

1245
00:54:26,260 --> 00:54:28,260
How far were you from Guy Fieri?

1246
00:54:28,260 --> 00:54:31,860
I want to say like it was like less than 10 feet.

1247
00:54:31,860 --> 00:54:32,500
Okay.

1248
00:54:32,500 --> 00:54:33,860
You were in the guy zone.

1249
00:54:33,860 --> 00:54:35,860
Nobody else fucking talk.

1250
00:54:35,860 --> 00:54:37,700
The story, I need it.

1251
00:54:37,700 --> 00:54:39,140
It's the air that I breathe.

1252
00:54:39,780 --> 00:54:46,340
So he gets up and he's like taking a picture with one of the people up front.

1253
00:54:46,340 --> 00:54:47,700
Like a fan, I guess.

1254
00:54:47,700 --> 00:54:48,980
And I have a little like-

1255
00:54:48,980 --> 00:54:52,660
I mean, I made a sign out of like the wax paper that covers the tray.

1256
00:54:53,380 --> 00:54:56,820
Said, Mayor Fieri, please feed me attendee.

1257
00:55:02,260 --> 00:55:05,380
Imagine me scooping you up in my arms, okay?

1258
00:55:05,380 --> 00:55:06,660
I'm very proud of you, son.

1259
00:55:08,020 --> 00:55:09,700
You did a very good job today.

1260
00:55:09,700 --> 00:55:10,820
He's very proud of you.

1261
00:55:11,380 --> 00:55:12,020
It means a lot.

1262
00:55:13,780 --> 00:55:14,500
So he sees-

1263
00:55:14,500 --> 00:55:15,140
He's taking the picture.

1264
00:55:15,140 --> 00:55:15,700
He sees it.

1265
00:55:15,700 --> 00:55:21,460
And he goes, do you want me to feed you a tender?

1266
00:55:21,460 --> 00:55:26,260
And I go, yeah, because the thing did a little wild here.

1267
00:55:26,260 --> 00:55:30,580
Joey Fatone, a couple of years ago, fed me a hot dog at the grand opening of this hot dog stand.

1268
00:55:30,580 --> 00:55:45,300
That wasn't in the email.

1269
00:55:47,700 --> 00:55:49,540
You are a lot, my dude.

1270
00:55:51,700 --> 00:55:55,620
You expect Guy Fieri to be like, oh, you're the feeding stuff too, Guy.

1271
00:55:55,620 --> 00:56:01,140
I won't be outdone by Joey Fatone.

1272
00:56:01,140 --> 00:56:01,860
Not again.

1273
00:56:02,740 --> 00:56:03,460
Close, Travis.

1274
00:56:03,460 --> 00:56:04,980
He said, I don't want to take you.

1275
00:56:04,980 --> 00:56:07,300
That's you and Joey's thing.

1276
00:56:08,260 --> 00:56:08,580
Okay.

1277
00:56:08,580 --> 00:56:10,260
That's very respectful of him.

1278
00:56:10,260 --> 00:56:11,220
Very respectful of him.

1279
00:56:11,220 --> 00:56:14,420
What is the name of Joey Fatone's hot dog brand?

1280
00:56:14,420 --> 00:56:15,220
It's called Fat Ones.

1281
00:56:16,340 --> 00:56:16,580
Great.

1282
00:56:19,060 --> 00:56:19,940
No, listen.

1283
00:56:19,940 --> 00:56:20,980
No, there's a lot of-

1284
00:56:20,980 --> 00:56:24,020
Is it possible I call it Fatones and you're just a jerk?

1285
00:56:24,020 --> 00:56:24,980
Possibly.

1286
00:56:24,980 --> 00:56:27,060
Listen, there's a lot of good stuff.

1287
00:56:27,060 --> 00:56:28,420
We have to get to your question.

1288
00:56:30,180 --> 00:56:33,940
So he offers to toss the tender into my mouth.

1289
00:56:33,940 --> 00:56:34,180
Sick.

1290
00:56:35,140 --> 00:56:37,380
A hot tender, like fresh out of the fryer?

1291
00:56:37,380 --> 00:56:38,500
Probably not.

1292
00:56:38,500 --> 00:56:41,460
It was my last remaining tender I had in my box.

1293
00:56:41,460 --> 00:56:44,020
It was a little cold, but it was fine.

1294
00:56:44,020 --> 00:56:45,780
I saved it for this reason.

1295
00:56:47,860 --> 00:56:48,180
And?

1296
00:56:48,980 --> 00:56:53,140
And I gave him my tender and I stepped back a couple feet

1297
00:56:53,140 --> 00:56:55,620
and he tossed the tender into my mouth.

1298
00:56:55,620 --> 00:56:59,780
The tenders are big, so it got into my mouth

1299
00:56:59,780 --> 00:57:01,860
and kind of just like bounced out onto the floor.

1300
00:57:01,860 --> 00:57:02,020
Sure.

1301
00:57:03,860 --> 00:57:05,460
I'm not proud of you anymore, son.

1302
00:57:06,020 --> 00:57:10,340
Well, should I have eaten the tender off of the floor?

1303
00:57:10,340 --> 00:57:10,660
Yes.

1304
00:57:10,660 --> 00:57:10,980
Yes.

1305
00:57:13,300 --> 00:57:13,620
Yes.

1306
00:57:14,420 --> 00:57:14,900
Yes.

1307
00:57:14,900 --> 00:57:16,260
The answer is yes.

1308
00:57:16,260 --> 00:57:18,740
And you should have eaten it off the floor.

1309
00:57:18,740 --> 00:57:19,060
Yeah.

1310
00:57:19,060 --> 00:57:23,780
Like hands and knees.

1311
00:57:23,780 --> 00:57:24,900
Does that answer your question?

1312
00:57:25,540 --> 00:57:26,020
Yeah.

1313
00:57:26,020 --> 00:57:26,420
All right.

1314
00:57:26,420 --> 00:57:26,660
Thanks.

1315
00:57:28,500 --> 00:57:29,140
Thank you.

1316
00:57:29,140 --> 00:57:30,100
Thank you.

1317
00:57:30,100 --> 00:57:30,660
So dope.

1318
00:57:33,060 --> 00:57:38,020
Can we get Quinn, orchestra, right, seat E, row four?

1319
00:57:38,020 --> 00:57:39,380
Go ahead and head down.

1320
00:57:39,380 --> 00:57:40,020
Hey, what's up?

1321
00:57:40,020 --> 00:57:41,460
Row E, seat four.

1322
00:57:41,460 --> 00:57:41,940
Hello.

1323
00:57:41,940 --> 00:57:42,740
I just fucked up.

1324
00:57:42,740 --> 00:57:43,220
Hey.

1325
00:57:43,220 --> 00:57:43,700
Hi.

1326
00:57:43,700 --> 00:57:43,940
Hi.

1327
00:57:44,580 --> 00:57:46,020
So I don't know how to start.

1328
00:57:46,020 --> 00:57:46,900
What's your name?

1329
00:57:46,900 --> 00:57:47,620
My name's Emily.

1330
00:57:47,620 --> 00:57:48,180
Emily.

1331
00:57:48,180 --> 00:57:48,660
I am.

1332
00:57:48,660 --> 00:57:48,900
Yeah.

1333
00:57:48,900 --> 00:57:49,620
Hi.

1334
00:57:49,620 --> 00:57:50,980
Sorry, I said Emma.

1335
00:57:50,980 --> 00:57:52,100
I truncated it.

1336
00:57:52,100 --> 00:57:53,700
I took a wild swing at the email.

1337
00:57:53,700 --> 00:57:54,020
OK.

1338
00:57:54,020 --> 00:57:54,420
It's OK.

1339
00:57:54,420 --> 00:57:55,620
It's not even how I spell my name.

1340
00:57:55,620 --> 00:57:55,860
OK.

1341
00:57:57,300 --> 00:58:00,020
So basically, do you know those Bigfoot shows

1342
00:58:00,020 --> 00:58:02,900
on like most channels at this point?

1343
00:58:02,900 --> 00:58:05,460
I know we all have the guilty habit of watching them.

1344
00:58:05,460 --> 00:58:06,260
But my dad.

1345
00:58:06,980 --> 00:58:07,300
All of them?

1346
00:58:09,140 --> 00:58:09,380
Sure.

1347
00:58:10,500 --> 00:58:13,300
But my dad takes it to a very big point.

1348
00:58:14,180 --> 00:58:15,780
He now knows everybody's name.

1349
00:58:16,500 --> 00:58:17,620
He knows.

1350
00:58:17,620 --> 00:58:19,860
Everybody on the show, not just everybody.

1351
00:58:19,860 --> 00:58:20,660
On most shows.

1352
00:58:20,660 --> 00:58:21,140
OK.

1353
00:58:21,140 --> 00:58:22,580
He's actually in the audience.

1354
00:58:22,580 --> 00:58:24,180
And he's probably thriving right now.

1355
00:58:24,180 --> 00:58:24,740
Are you here?

1356
00:58:25,300 --> 00:58:26,500
Yeah, he's right there.

1357
00:58:29,140 --> 00:58:29,700
Represent.

1358
00:58:31,380 --> 00:58:34,740
But at this point, we have a whistle, which I'm sorry,

1359
00:58:34,740 --> 00:58:35,780
I didn't bring it with me.

1360
00:58:35,780 --> 00:58:37,380
It's actually a Bigfoot whistle.

1361
00:58:37,940 --> 00:58:40,500
And you blow into it and it makes a Bigfoot noise.

1362
00:58:40,500 --> 00:58:42,260
Whoever just screamed what?

1363
00:58:42,260 --> 00:58:42,660
Yes.

1364
00:58:44,820 --> 00:58:46,260
I don't mean to put you on the spot.

1365
00:58:46,260 --> 00:58:47,620
So you can say no to this.

1366
00:58:47,620 --> 00:58:48,900
Can you imitate it?

1367
00:58:48,900 --> 00:58:50,020
You can't say no to this.

1368
00:58:50,020 --> 00:58:50,580
I must know.

1369
00:58:52,660 --> 00:58:53,060
It's like.

1370
00:58:57,460 --> 00:58:58,580
That is what it would be.

1371
00:59:00,900 --> 00:59:02,900
That's what I found in my studies.

1372
00:59:04,260 --> 00:59:07,620
In all my research, that's what it points to.

1373
00:59:07,620 --> 00:59:08,340
That's correct.

1374
00:59:09,140 --> 00:59:10,100
He loves that noise.

1375
00:59:10,100 --> 00:59:11,620
He's crazy for it.

1376
00:59:11,620 --> 00:59:13,540
He would hear that and be like, my friend?

1377
00:59:13,540 --> 00:59:15,540
All right.

1378
00:59:17,060 --> 00:59:22,340
Needless to say, it doesn't attract the Bigfoots like we had been hoping.

1379
00:59:24,740 --> 00:59:28,580
Basically, I'm trying to figure out if I should let this Bigfoot addiction continue.

1380
00:59:31,540 --> 00:59:35,300
Now at this point, I don't know if I'm going to have a mascot of Bigfoot next year.

1381
00:59:36,500 --> 00:59:38,900
I don't know if this is going to become an addiction.

1382
00:59:39,860 --> 00:59:41,140
Not that it hasn't already.

1383
00:59:41,140 --> 00:59:45,140
Is it going to reach that point?

1384
00:59:45,780 --> 00:59:46,580
Just a mascot?

1385
00:59:46,580 --> 00:59:49,860
Just all the money has gone to Bigfoot related whistles?

1386
00:59:50,500 --> 00:59:51,460
Yeah, basically.

1387
00:59:54,180 --> 00:59:56,420
We have a very big surprise for you tonight.

1388
00:59:57,700 --> 00:59:58,260
Bigfoot.

1389
00:59:59,060 --> 01:00:00,100
Oh my god.

1390
01:00:00,100 --> 01:00:00,820
Come on out.

1391
01:00:00,820 --> 01:00:01,300
Is he here?

1392
01:00:02,340 --> 01:00:03,220
Oh, he couldn't make it.

1393
01:00:03,220 --> 01:00:04,820
Okay, we wasted the VIP.

1394
01:00:06,500 --> 01:00:08,820
But what if your dad is the one who finds Bigfoot?

1395
01:00:08,820 --> 01:00:12,420
That's it.

1396
01:00:12,420 --> 01:00:15,460
Listen, somebody had to invent the light bulb.

1397
01:00:16,340 --> 01:00:18,100
Somebody had to sing the highest note.

1398
01:00:18,100 --> 01:00:20,500
Somebody had to swim the channel for the first time.

1399
01:00:21,220 --> 01:00:25,220
Somebody's got to find Bigfoot and maybe it's your dad.

1400
01:00:25,220 --> 01:00:29,060
You got to get in there before David Blaine does it because you know he'll find the fucking Bigfoot.

1401
01:00:30,580 --> 01:00:34,500
If you want to call Bigfoot, don't use a whistle.

1402
01:00:34,500 --> 01:00:36,500
Just pick up a phone and call him.

1403
01:00:36,500 --> 01:00:38,820
Yeah, use 1-800-Collect.

1404
01:00:38,820 --> 01:00:40,980
No, just call Bigfoot.

1405
01:00:40,980 --> 01:00:42,020
What's his number?

1406
01:00:42,020 --> 01:00:42,660
What?

1407
01:00:42,660 --> 01:00:43,540
I don't know his number.

1408
01:00:43,540 --> 01:00:44,660
Travis has the right idea.

1409
01:00:44,660 --> 01:00:46,500
1-800-Collect, say Bigfoot, please.

1410
01:00:46,500 --> 01:00:50,260
And the operator will be like, oh shit, I have to handle that.

1411
01:00:50,260 --> 01:00:51,700
I guess you win.

1412
01:00:51,700 --> 01:00:54,180
These shows, they never, first episode.

1413
01:00:54,180 --> 01:00:56,100
If I make one of these shows, find a Bigfoot.

1414
01:00:56,100 --> 01:00:57,300
What's episode one?

1415
01:00:57,300 --> 01:00:58,020
Find a Bigfoot.

1416
01:00:58,020 --> 01:00:59,940
Episode one, whitepages.org.

1417
01:01:00,500 --> 01:01:01,540
I search Bigfoot.

1418
01:01:02,420 --> 01:01:05,700
I put it, if they want a location, forests.

1419
01:01:05,700 --> 01:01:06,500
Trees, yeah.

1420
01:01:06,500 --> 01:01:07,300
Trees.

1421
01:01:07,300 --> 01:01:08,660
I search Bigfoot.

1422
01:01:08,660 --> 01:01:10,180
A phone number pops up.

1423
01:01:10,180 --> 01:01:11,620
There's one result.

1424
01:01:11,620 --> 01:01:12,660
There's only one Bigfoot.

1425
01:01:12,660 --> 01:01:13,460
It's very sad.

1426
01:01:14,180 --> 01:01:16,900
You call the number on there, just say hi.

1427
01:01:16,900 --> 01:01:17,860
Just talk to Bigfoot.

1428
01:01:17,860 --> 01:01:18,900
He'd love to hear from you.

1429
01:01:19,940 --> 01:01:21,140
He doesn't get a lot of drop-ins.

1430
01:01:21,140 --> 01:01:22,180
He might not meet you.

1431
01:01:22,740 --> 01:01:26,020
Yes, he's very shy, but he'll talk to you.

1432
01:01:26,020 --> 01:01:29,780
But he's not mean like the beef jerky commercials make him out to be.

1433
01:01:29,780 --> 01:01:35,300
I hate those fucking commercials where it's like pranking on Bigfoot's ass and it's like,

1434
01:01:35,300 --> 01:01:38,820
yeah, he's going to hit you and throw you if you prank his ass.

1435
01:01:39,780 --> 01:01:44,020
If you dunk on Bigfoot's balls, he is going to be so mad at you, beef jerky.

1436
01:01:44,020 --> 01:01:47,060
But if you call him on a telephone, chill, dude.

1437
01:01:47,060 --> 01:01:47,460
Hey.

1438
01:01:47,460 --> 01:01:47,860
Yeah.

1439
01:01:47,860 --> 01:01:50,980
And just talk to him about World War II airplanes.

1440
01:01:50,980 --> 01:01:51,860
That's his passion.

1441
01:01:51,860 --> 01:01:52,500
He loves that shit.

1442
01:01:52,500 --> 01:01:54,100
He loves that shit.

1443
01:01:54,100 --> 01:01:54,980
All of them.

1444
01:01:54,980 --> 01:01:56,740
Can you do the whistle noise again?

1445
01:01:56,740 --> 01:01:57,700
Just one more time.

1446
01:02:00,020 --> 01:02:01,060
Is this a serious question?

1447
01:02:01,060 --> 01:02:01,560
Yeah.

1448
01:02:01,560 --> 01:02:09,480
All right, ladies and gentlemen, thank you so much.

1449
01:02:13,000 --> 01:02:13,320
All right.

1450
01:02:13,320 --> 01:02:13,960
Does that help?

1451
01:02:15,880 --> 01:02:16,360
What?

1452
01:02:16,360 --> 01:02:17,080
Does that help?

1453
01:02:17,800 --> 01:02:18,200
Yes.

1454
01:02:18,200 --> 01:02:19,560
Just one quick fun fact.

1455
01:02:20,280 --> 01:02:22,280
My dog is terrified of the whistle.

1456
01:02:23,480 --> 01:02:26,200
Yeah, because your dog's like, oh shit, Bigfoot's coming.

1457
01:02:27,320 --> 01:02:28,120
What are you doing?

1458
01:02:28,120 --> 01:02:29,080
I gotta get out of here.

1459
01:02:29,080 --> 01:02:32,120
You're playing with forces you couldn't possibly understand.

1460
01:02:32,120 --> 01:02:33,240
Have you seen that fool?

1461
01:02:33,240 --> 01:02:34,200
He's giant.

1462
01:02:35,080 --> 01:02:35,720
Thank you, Emily.

1463
01:02:36,280 --> 01:02:36,600
Thank you.

1464
01:02:37,800 --> 01:02:38,920
Quinn, did you make it?

1465
01:02:39,880 --> 01:02:40,760
Down here, Quinn.

1466
01:02:41,640 --> 01:02:44,760
Orchestra right, row E, seat four.

1467
01:02:44,760 --> 01:02:46,040
Quinn.

1468
01:02:46,040 --> 01:02:48,120
There's two possible Quins.

1469
01:02:48,120 --> 01:02:48,360
Wait.

1470
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:49,560
No, okay.

1471
01:02:49,560 --> 01:02:51,880
You just scared the shit out of us.

1472
01:02:51,880 --> 01:02:54,280
One of the Quins was coming back for the bathroom.

1473
01:02:54,280 --> 01:02:55,240
Now, Quinn.

1474
01:02:55,880 --> 01:02:56,120
Yeah.

1475
01:02:56,120 --> 01:02:59,000
Yeah, go ahead.

1476
01:03:00,600 --> 01:03:05,800
Oh, okay, so I was at work one day and I was at the elevator

1477
01:03:05,800 --> 01:03:08,760
and there was another woman who was approaching the elevator

1478
01:03:08,760 --> 01:03:10,520
at the same time as me.

1479
01:03:10,520 --> 01:03:12,840
I pressed up, she pressed down.

1480
01:03:13,400 --> 01:03:14,920
It's a common thing that happens.

1481
01:03:14,920 --> 01:03:15,160
Okay.

1482
01:03:15,160 --> 01:03:16,600
All right, everybody, calm down.

1483
01:03:17,160 --> 01:03:17,960
It happens.

1484
01:03:19,240 --> 01:03:23,640
An elevator arrives and the doors open and the down arrow

1485
01:03:23,640 --> 01:03:26,120
is blinking, indicating it was hers.

1486
01:03:26,840 --> 01:03:30,680
And she looks at me, gestures and says, after you.

1487
01:03:33,240 --> 01:03:35,000
I said, oh, no, thank you.

1488
01:03:35,000 --> 01:03:35,960
I'm going up.

1489
01:03:35,960 --> 01:03:39,960
And then she looked at me very seriously and said,

1490
01:03:39,960 --> 01:03:41,400
you know, they go both ways, right?

1491
01:03:41,400 --> 01:03:55,720
And I kind of went, yeah, and then looked down at my phone.

1492
01:03:55,720 --> 01:03:56,200
So good.

1493
01:03:56,840 --> 01:03:57,320
Very good.

1494
01:03:57,320 --> 01:04:00,120
And she went, oh, you've gotten out of this one.

1495
01:04:00,120 --> 01:04:02,200
Did you get on the fucking elevator?

1496
01:04:02,200 --> 01:04:02,840
Oh, no.

1497
01:04:02,840 --> 01:04:03,480
Okay, good.

1498
01:04:04,680 --> 01:04:05,720
I waited.

1499
01:04:05,720 --> 01:04:08,680
The doors immediately closed and she didn't indicate that

1500
01:04:08,680 --> 01:04:10,600
she was like, I'm just kidding.

1501
01:04:10,600 --> 01:04:11,080
Okay.

1502
01:04:11,080 --> 01:04:12,920
Wait, so she didn't get on it?

1503
01:04:12,920 --> 01:04:13,960
She did get on to go down.

1504
01:04:13,960 --> 01:04:14,760
Oh, thank God.

1505
01:04:14,760 --> 01:04:16,360
And then the moment was over.

1506
01:04:16,360 --> 01:04:19,640
So I thought for a second, she gestured, you didn't,

1507
01:04:19,640 --> 01:04:20,680
so she didn't either.

1508
01:04:20,680 --> 01:04:22,760
Because you could see the future.

1509
01:04:22,760 --> 01:04:25,000
You knew the car was going to plummet to the ground.

1510
01:04:25,720 --> 01:04:26,840
So what's your question?

1511
01:04:27,560 --> 01:04:28,120
Can we help?

1512
01:04:28,120 --> 01:04:30,520
She works in my building and what happens

1513
01:04:30,520 --> 01:04:32,520
if this situation happens again?

1514
01:04:32,520 --> 01:04:33,720
It will happen again.

1515
01:04:33,720 --> 01:04:34,280
It will.

1516
01:04:34,280 --> 01:04:35,160
That's life for you.

1517
01:04:35,720 --> 01:04:38,440
First of all, you did the right thing in looking down at your

1518
01:04:38,440 --> 01:04:40,040
phone and going, ha ha, yeah.

1519
01:04:40,040 --> 01:04:43,080
Because you can, you can get out of,

1520
01:04:43,080 --> 01:04:45,000
you can get out of most situations that way.

1521
01:04:46,120 --> 01:04:48,120
Second thing, I regret to inform you,

1522
01:04:48,120 --> 01:04:49,160
you have been bullied.

1523
01:04:54,440 --> 01:04:56,200
So you think you've been bullied?

1524
01:04:56,200 --> 01:04:56,440
Yes.

1525
01:04:57,160 --> 01:04:57,800
It's accurate.

1526
01:04:59,560 --> 01:05:00,200
Shit.

1527
01:05:00,200 --> 01:05:01,320
Because here's the thing.

1528
01:05:01,320 --> 01:05:02,920
Here's what you should have said to her.

1529
01:05:02,920 --> 01:05:05,000
You know, they go both ways and you should have said,

1530
01:05:05,000 --> 01:05:06,600
but not at the same time.

1531
01:05:06,600 --> 01:05:06,840
Right.

1532
01:05:06,840 --> 01:05:09,320
Hey, it's not a fucking wonkivator.

1533
01:05:10,280 --> 01:05:12,520
You're going down and I'm going up.

1534
01:05:12,520 --> 01:05:14,440
And right now it's pointed down.

1535
01:05:14,440 --> 01:05:15,480
How do I know?

1536
01:05:15,480 --> 01:05:16,760
There's an arrow.

1537
01:05:16,760 --> 01:05:17,320
She does.

1538
01:05:17,880 --> 01:05:19,080
She does have a point though.

1539
01:05:19,880 --> 01:05:21,080
Because what you've said is,

1540
01:05:22,440 --> 01:05:25,240
I know it would take the exact same amount of time for me.

1541
01:05:25,960 --> 01:05:28,920
I just don't want to spend that time with you.

1542
01:05:28,920 --> 01:05:30,520
There were two elevators.

1543
01:05:30,520 --> 01:05:32,040
Oh wait, was there only one elevator?

1544
01:05:32,040 --> 01:05:33,480
There were two elevators.

1545
01:05:33,480 --> 01:05:33,800
Okay.

1546
01:05:33,800 --> 01:05:34,280
Okay.

1547
01:05:34,280 --> 01:05:36,200
Well then, okay.

1548
01:05:36,200 --> 01:05:37,800
You, here's one thing you could do.

1549
01:05:39,160 --> 01:05:45,000
Follow her when she is heading elevator ward.

1550
01:05:45,000 --> 01:05:45,640
Oh, what did you say?

1551
01:05:45,640 --> 01:05:46,440
Follow the money.

1552
01:05:46,440 --> 01:05:47,480
Follow the money.

1553
01:05:47,480 --> 01:05:48,280
Follow the money.

1554
01:05:49,400 --> 01:05:50,680
What does she have to gain?

1555
01:05:51,880 --> 01:05:53,960
From bullying you so viciously.

1556
01:05:55,240 --> 01:05:57,080
Follow her when she's going elevator ward

1557
01:05:57,880 --> 01:06:00,680
and try to recreate this scenario.

1558
01:06:00,680 --> 01:06:05,320
But have it so that the elevator is going your way.

1559
01:06:05,320 --> 01:06:08,920
And then you say, mount up regulators.

1560
01:06:10,200 --> 01:06:12,440
And then she gets on and she goes up

1561
01:06:12,440 --> 01:06:14,600
when she means to go down and you step off like,

1562
01:06:14,600 --> 01:06:16,920
how you're looks like you're higher up than you should.

1563
01:06:17,480 --> 01:06:18,840
And at that point the doors have closed

1564
01:06:18,840 --> 01:06:20,600
and you didn't say anything cool.

1565
01:06:21,560 --> 01:06:26,360
But she'll know and she'll resign in disgrace the next day.

1566
01:06:27,800 --> 01:06:29,800
And that's how you become CEO.

1567
01:06:33,560 --> 01:06:34,520
Does that help?

1568
01:06:34,520 --> 01:06:36,840
Wait, wait, Quinn, real quick before I let you go.

1569
01:06:38,680 --> 01:06:40,520
Could you do the Bigfoot whistle noise?

1570
01:06:45,080 --> 01:06:45,640
Very good.

1571
01:06:45,640 --> 01:06:46,280
Thank you.

1572
01:06:46,280 --> 01:06:47,080
Thank you, Quinn.

1573
01:06:48,120 --> 01:06:50,360
Thank you to you, Orlando.

1574
01:06:50,360 --> 01:06:54,760
Thank you, Orlando, so much for coming to see us.

1575
01:06:55,800 --> 01:06:58,040
Thank you to the Walt Disney Theater.

1576
01:06:58,040 --> 01:06:58,920
You're amazing.

1577
01:06:59,560 --> 01:07:00,360
Can I just say,

1578
01:07:00,360 --> 01:07:05,160
Quinn's sounded like Bigfoot in his local production of Streetcar Named Desire.

1579
01:07:07,160 --> 01:07:08,760
Ripped his shirt open.

1580
01:07:08,760 --> 01:07:09,640
Thank you to Paul.

1581
01:07:09,640 --> 01:07:10,440
Thank you to our dad.

1582
01:07:10,440 --> 01:07:11,400
Paul Sabourin.

1583
01:07:11,400 --> 01:07:12,840
Paul Sabourin, Arnani.

1584
01:07:12,840 --> 01:07:13,720
Thank you, Nani.

1585
01:07:16,920 --> 01:07:17,960
Real quick.

1586
01:07:17,960 --> 01:07:20,040
Here's a Yahoo that was sent in by Merit Palmer.

1587
01:07:20,040 --> 01:07:20,920
It's our closer.

1588
01:07:20,920 --> 01:07:21,560
Thank you, Merit.

1589
01:07:21,560 --> 01:07:23,880
It's Yahoo Answers user Garrick who asks,

1590
01:07:23,880 --> 01:07:29,240
Any bands that write lyrics about how difficult the job market is?

1591
01:07:31,240 --> 01:07:32,920
My name is Justin McElroy.
