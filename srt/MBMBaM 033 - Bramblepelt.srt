1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there will know how cool they are for listening.

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:30,000
If you change your mind, I'm the first in line. Honey, I'm still free, take a chance on me.

6
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:40,000
If you need me, let me know, I'm gonna be around. If you got no place to go, when you're feeling down.

7
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:45,000
If you're all alone, where the pretty birds have flown, it's me.

8
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:53,000
If you change your mind, I'm the first in line. Honey, I'm still free, take a chance on me.

9
00:00:53,000 --> 00:01:15,000
If you change your mind, I'm the first in line. Honey, I'm still free, take a chance on me.

10
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:33,000
And if you ask, then you are sure to know, it's beginning to look a lot like wisdom here on My Brother, My Brother, and Me.

11
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:39,000
It's an advice show for the modern era. I am your oldest brother, Justin McElroy.

12
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,000
I'm the middle brother, Travis McElroy.

13
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
And it's your boy, Griffin.

14
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Hey, um, would you guys say that-

15
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
You asshole.

16
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Are we on that Christmas creep?

17
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Holiday, we're on the holiday creep.

18
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Can I, am I the only one who thinks Christmas creep sounds like a hip hop dance move?

19
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:03,000
That's like taking, like the Dougie, or the orange soda?

20
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Yeah.

21
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,000
That's, by the way, get on YouTube and search for the Kel Mitchell orange soda dance.

22
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,000
He's back, he's back, and he's invented an actual dance. I'm not making that up.

23
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Yeah, except by he's back, the video's from 2008.

24
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:19,000
He's definitely on his way back. He started a slow climb.

25
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
It's a slow-

26
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
It's a Christmas creep to the top.

27
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
It is a Christmas creep.

28
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Can we write a, can we, is it too late to like capitalize on that? Can we write a song on the Christmas creep?

29
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
First you jingle your bells.

30
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:34,000
I'm on that Christmas creep. I'm on that Christmas creep. I'm on that Christmas creep.

31
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:40,000
As long as we can still, as long as we can still do my B-side of Hanukkah hustle.

32
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Do the hustle.

33
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:48,000
First you jingle your bells, then you mistle your toes. There's gotta be something else.

34
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:59,000
We'll finish, this is something that really should be saved for My Melody, My Melody and Me, our improvisational songwriting show.

35
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:06,000
So let's get right into the questions. We take your questions into us through email, Gmail, Tree Mail.

36
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
This first one comes to us from Gmail.

37
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:13,000
I recently met a Canadian girl on Omegle, and I've begun an online relationship.

38
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,000
My friend told me there are no real girls on the internet.

39
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Is this true? If so, should I still pursue a relationship with someone who might be a dude?

40
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Those are two completely different questions.

41
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Confused in Connecticut.

42
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:35,000
First off, let's start with the obvious question. Are there real girls on the internet? The answer is of course no.

43
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Nope. Nope. Not a one.

44
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Also, there are no real girls in Canada.

45
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:45,000
I was going to say in the world. I'm thinking we've all been duped.

46
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Oh my God.

47
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
It's a pretty massive cover up.

48
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Is it all holograms?

49
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,000
It's pretty much 100% holograms.

50
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Hologals? Is that closer where we're at?

51
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:04,000
This is a terrible situation you find yourself in because Omegle, for those who aren't familiar, is an anonymous chat service, right?

52
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:12,000
That hooks you up with a random person with no verification of their age, sex, location, anything.

53
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:23,000
That you could be at the butt of a really brutal, long-lasting, hilarious-to-everyone-but-you prank.

54
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
The longest con.

55
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
The longest of cons.

56
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:31,000
They say love is the longest con. I think Omegle love is slightly longer than that.

57
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:36,000
I'm going to straight up, I think it's time for a little tough love, my brother, my brother and me style.

58
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:44,000
What kind of life are you living that you start an online relationship with someone on Omegle?

59
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:53,000
I can literally think of no worse place to start any kind of relationship, professional, romantic or otherwise.

60
00:04:53,000 --> 00:05:00,000
That would be like saying, I met the nicest guy on Chatroulette. He was wanking his dong. It was awesome.

61
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
He was what?

62
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Wanking his dong.

63
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:07,000
That's not a combination of those words. I know you're going for individually, but combined I don't think that's a...

64
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
I don't like that one bit.

65
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
That's not a combination that works.

66
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
I'm almost certain it is.

67
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
You workshop it, take it out.

68
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Basically what you just said was he was masturbating his penis, which is redundant.

69
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Yeah, here's how we're going to turn this into a W.

70
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:33,000
You're going to say you're going to meet up with this person and then you're going to say, listen, I'm too cool to meet someone I met on Omegle.

71
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Never talk to me again and then just like block them from your life.

72
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
You'll feel good about it.

73
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
They'll, who cares?

74
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
They're anonymous.

75
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
You didn't know him before.

76
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,000
You can go back to not knowing him now and you just bail on this.

77
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:46,000
You've got to pull the old eject and get out.

78
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Trust me on this.

79
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:50,000
You have a little to no investment in this.

80
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
This is imaginary.

81
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
This is not real.

82
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Unless.

83
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Unless.

84
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
What if it is true love?

85
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Shit.

86
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Fuck.

87
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,000
You know how vulnerable I am to the possibility of true love, Griffin.

88
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
I know.

89
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,000
And it can spring up in the weirdest of places.

90
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
And make no mistake, this is the weirdest of places.

91
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:12,000
The literal weirdest place on the planet.

92
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:18,000
I mean, maybe it's just two lonely souls because that's all that's on Omegle.

93
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:24,000
And maybe they just found each other and just connected on some deep spiritual level.

94
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:28,000
And if that's the case, then you don't need to be worried about whether or not it's a dude.

95
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
I got it.

96
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
But here's my counter argument to that.

97
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Okay.

98
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:41,000
There is no possible way, like in my opinion, that you are meeting the honest to goodness person that they are on Omegle.

99
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Why not?

100
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Because there's no way they go on and go, and I snore.

101
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:49,000
And I also, like, there's no way because nobody does that.

102
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Well, nobody does that anyway in the world.

103
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Yeah.

104
00:06:52,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Well, no, but you get to know the person and like, you know, it's not like I met you, I've never seen your face, I've never spoken to you about anything that's, you know, real, and I love you.

105
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
That's not how that works.

106
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
I don't think that he's not saying let's get hitched.

107
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
He's saying, should I pursue?

108
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Okay.

109
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Okay.

110
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Okay.

111
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Here's what we do.

112
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:15,000
We set this up in ways that increase the real world intimacy of this relationship.

113
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:19,000
First, you're gonna call on the phone.

114
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Nice.

115
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Okay?

116
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
That's what we're doing.

117
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
We're calling on the phone if we're pursuing this.

118
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Two, we are chatting on Skype.

119
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Nice.

120
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,000
And making sure no one's doing any ventriloquist nonsense.

121
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:36,000
We gotta see the real Omegle freak right there and make sure that it is an acceptable situation.

122
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:42,000
So you don't want to fall victim, you don't want to fall prey to a truth about cats and dogs style dupe.

123
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,000
You want to know that the correct voice is coming out of the correct lady.

124
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Right.

125
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,000
I don't want a Janine Groffalo, Uma Thurman, Swaperoonie, okay?

126
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Nice try, Janine.

127
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Nice try, Janine.

128
00:07:53,000 --> 00:08:00,000
And I think another concern here is, you know, that idea of, oh, it turned out to be a dude and we were sex chatting and whatnot.

129
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Don't do that.

130
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Like, you haven't met this person, you shouldn't be sex chatting or whatever it is you kids do.

131
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
You may very well be.

132
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:13,000
There's probably a blog somewhere that says, look at the freaky stuff I can get this guy to say on Omegle.

133
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Oh my god, I read that blog.

134
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Yeah, yeah.

135
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
It's that one.

136
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
The really funny one.

137
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
But anyway.

138
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
I love that one.

139
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
With the little illustrations.

140
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
I love it.

141
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
So hopefully that'll help.

142
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:30,000
You just gotta, don't bail on it, but do, you want some real world connections here.

143
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
You want phone calls.

144
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
You want video chat.

145
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
You want to really see this person.

146
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:42,000
And because you can't build a relationship with chatting anymore until we can verify that this person is.

147
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:50,000
And there's so much in like that intonation and in speech and in how your chemistry, if it's there, I say you gotta go phone.

148
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
But you gotta be safe.

149
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Be safe, be smart.

150
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Don't meet them anywhere, ever.

151
00:08:55,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Because you have brewed up a murdered cocktail here that you do not want to be sipping on.

152
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
It's anonymous.

153
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
That's scary.

154
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:05,000
A hundred percent of murders are anonymous.

155
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
None of your friends have ever met her.

156
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
So there's no identifying her later.

157
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
That's scary.

158
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
That's very scary.

159
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Okay.

160
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
I feel like, I feel like we should move on.

161
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:24,000
I have hooked up with one of my closest friends a couple of times and he tells me he enjoyed those times, but he wants to keep our hookups a secret from everyone.

162
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Why doesn't he want to tell anyone?

163
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Because you're ugly.

164
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Whoa.

165
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
I'm just kidding.

166
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:36,000
You also might be annoying or crazy.

167
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Maybe you're terrible.

168
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Thanks for listening.

169
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Thanks for listening.

170
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
We enjoy your patronage.

171
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
No, no, no.

172
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
It's that he doesn't want things to get weird.

173
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Like you've got a group of friends, two people hook up and it's a weird, it's going to be a weird scene.

174
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Also, there's another option that's not insulting to you.

175
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
He might be terrible.

176
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:02,000
He might be, you know, wheezing the juice.

177
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Why wouldn't you want everybody to know that you're dating someone or you're making love to someone less terrible than you?

178
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Well, because he might be a sleazeball.

179
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
And so he might be like, no, I really like you.

180
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
I really like you, but don't tell anyone.

181
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:19,000
You should just sleep with me and then not tell anyone.

182
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:27,000
He's trying to get the proverbial sex milk without having a relationship cow.

183
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Is that what you're saying?

184
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
That's exactly what it is.

185
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:32,000
No metaphors either.

186
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
I can never drink milk again.

187
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
Nope.

188
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:38,000
What you need to do is you need to confront him.

189
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
You need to be like, why are you keeping this?

190
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
No, I'm not saying you need to tell everyone.

191
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:45,000
You need to ask him why he wants to keep it a secret.

192
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:49,000
You need to be like, so what's shaking Kevin Bacon?

193
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Why aren't we, you know, letting everyone know?

194
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Yeah, well, OK, here's the thing that is very logical to me about this question.

195
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:00,000
He wants to keep our hookups a secret from everyone.

196
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:05,000
OK, that's that's to me is a very logical like because it should be a secret.

197
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
It is. You get that shit out.

198
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
It's a secret.

199
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
It's a secret you have in this day and age.

200
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
That's a treasure.

201
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:16,000
Something that, you know, other people don't, that you can keep private.

202
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,000
Oh, yeah.

203
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
That's awesome.

204
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,000
What a wonderful gift that is.

205
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:24,000
But that's not even it's not just the beauty of secrets.

206
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:32,000
It's if you if you get laid, if you get your bone on like don't walk down the street like got my bone on today.

207
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
Got my bone on today.

208
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:37,000
Here's the name of the person that I did it with.

209
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,000
You can't.

210
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:41,000
You don't do that because it's not Facebook.

211
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,000
It's just not gentlemanly.

212
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
It's not ladylike either.

213
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,000
It's not what people do.

214
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:48,000
Like, I don't understand why why this person is upset.

215
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,000
Do they want them to be like, hey, what's up?

216
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:53,000
We fuck.

217
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
Hey, do you hear about me and Jerry?

218
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:58,000
We fuck.

219
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:01,000
It sounds like to me like there's crossed wires.

220
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:04,000
Like maybe you want more than he does.

221
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
That's what this question is really about, isn't it?

222
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,000
Yeah.

223
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
That's what this question is really about.

224
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:14,000
You want to take it to the next level and he wants to keep it a secret, uncomplicated.

225
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Again, makes total sense.

226
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
But if you I will warn you of this.

227
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:30,000
You do need to ask him if if you're interested in a relationship, you need to ask because it sounds to me like you do care a little bit more than you're letting on.

228
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,000
Yeah.

229
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:36,000
And you can't let your heart get busted up hooking up with this guy continually if there's not going to be any relationship there.

230
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
Can you agree with that Griffin?

231
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,000
Can you agree with that?

232
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
I wasn't listening.

233
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
I have a Yahoo answer question.

234
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
I was like in the middle of the wisdom.

235
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
I got the real nugget of this and you're like moving on.

236
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,000
Did you get it?

237
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,000
Sorry.

238
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,000
What?

239
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,000
It's a busy day.

240
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,000
I'm on that Christmas crawl.

241
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:55,000
I'm going to set you on fire.

242
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
What do you think Travis?

243
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,000
Will you listen to me?

244
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
I have a good sequitur.

245
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,000
Again, you're leaving.

246
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,000
You're leaving.

247
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,000
You're leaving this question.

248
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
Do you feel like you've answered it or can you not say?

249
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:08,000
What if I just told that person to murder suicide?

250
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,000
Let it simmer.

251
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,000
Professional advice.

252
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,000
Just let it chill.

253
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
Let it simmer.

254
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:16,000
That's the opposite of what I just said.

255
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:19,000
I basically just took what you said.

256
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
I'm just going to stay back here.

257
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:24,000
I boiled it down to a rich syrup.

258
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,000
To the opposite.

259
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,000
No.

260
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
It's like you melted down the chocolate and made lava.

261
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:31,000
There's no connection between the two ideas.

262
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:37,000
This Yahoo answer was sent in by Patrick Toy.

263
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:40,000
The only advice show that makes you dumber.

264
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:45,000
That makes you actually less equipped to deal with your situation.

265
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:52,000
Yahoo answer's user OhNo asks, are females attracted to the penis just as males are attracted

266
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:55,000
to female breasts and butt?

267
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:59,000
When a man sees female boobs and butt, they go boing, lol, I am immature.

268
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:06,000
Is it the same thing when a woman sees a male penis or are they like ew?

269
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
Yeah, it's like ew.

270
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,000
No, no, no.

271
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,000
It's lady bone zone.

272
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:14,000
I can't believe that's a thing.

273
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
I can't believe that's a thing, Travis.

274
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:19,000
I can't believe that a lady sees a boner and goes mm-hmm.

275
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,000
Yes, please.

276
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,000
Oh no, not a boner.

277
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,000
Just a penis.

278
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,000
Just anywhere.

279
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,000
A flaccid.

280
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:27,000
Just a flaccid, dangly piece of something.

281
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:31,000
I don't think the reaction could possibly be, oh yes.

282
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,000
Oh yes.

283
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
I think, I'm not a lady.

284
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:40,000
If I had to guess, I would imagine the reaction as something more akin to, well, here we are.

285
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
Well, we need those to make more life.

286
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
Oh, you again.

287
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
Ah, of course.

288
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:52,000
I can barely look, like when I'm in a shower hanging brain, I can barely observe my own

289
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:56,000
thing without getting a little sick.

290
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:03,000
I can't see my own without a complicated network of mirrors and volunteers.

291
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:07,000
I just have someone come in and describe it to me every day.

292
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:12,000
I have Leonardo DiCaprio come in and sketch it.

293
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:15,000
We have to be on a boat though or I can't finish.

294
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:21,000
I wish that Morgan Freeman delivered my penis report, my daily penis briefing.

295
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:25,000
I wish Morgan Freeman would give my penis the power to control the world around us.

296
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,000
Yes.

297
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:29,000
And teach me a valuable lesson in the process.

298
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:32,000
I feel like we're dodging the question though.

299
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:36,000
I think women's reaction is probably like when they're looking at a bunch of ingredients

300
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
before it's time to cook something.

301
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:46,000
Everyone likes to eat cake, but there's nothing necessarily appetizing about eggs and flour

302
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,000
and stuff.

303
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:50,000
I get what you're saying.

304
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,000
What?

305
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,000
I get what you're saying.

306
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,000
There's a logic to it, right?

307
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:58,000
There is some logic to it, but in the context of the question, you're making it sound like

308
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
women are turned on by baking.

309
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:03,000
Oh, of course, of course.

310
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:08,000
The interesting thing about this question is of course that with men, men who are into

311
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:11,000
large breasts, the larger they get, the better.

312
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:16,000
With women, there's very definitely like a fall, like if you're charting interest.

313
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,000
There's a bell chart.

314
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:23,000
There's a bell chart of interest and it peaks and then it goes like, wow, it plummets pretty

315
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,000
quickly.

316
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,000
I would imagine.

317
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,000
Thank God for that.

318
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:34,000
I think this question is illustrative of the fact that it's hard for guys to understand

319
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:38,000
why women find guys attractive because we're gross.

320
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:43,000
I assume women are attracted to the same thing on dudes that dudes are attracted to on women.

321
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,000
Like girls look at butts, right?

322
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,000
Don't they?

323
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,000
Personality?

324
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
Is that what you meant to say?

325
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:54,000
Yeah, they look at personality and they're like, look at that nice shapely personality.

326
00:16:54,000 --> 00:17:05,000
If I'm being judged on my breasts and it just seems to be the situation that you are describing,

327
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:12,000
that is not a part of my body I have ever worked on to improve, knowingly at least.

328
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:16,000
I feel like we're in one of those moods where we're anti-helpful.

329
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
We're making all these situations worse.

330
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,000
So let's do another one.

331
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:24,000
I'm an atheist and I haven't done don't feel like telling my family.

332
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:28,000
How do I politely get out of going to Christmas mass without them asking too many questions?

333
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,000
Form spring.

334
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:33,000
Wow, this is a good question.

335
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:38,000
I have my answer, which is you go to Christmas mass because it ain't about you.

336
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,000
It's about your family.

337
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,000
Yeah, that's kind of true.

338
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:44,000
Like you can I totally get I grok where you're coming from.

339
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:47,000
Like I get the whole like you're not feeling it.

340
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:51,000
So you you don't don't want to go.

341
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,000
But it really is.

342
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:58,000
It's like an hour and you're going for your family so they can feel like that togetherness.

343
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:04,000
And also there's a lot to like even if you're an atheist, there's a lot to like in the ceremony,

344
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,000
the tradition.

345
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,000
Sure.

346
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:09,000
You know, there's there's usually some incense.

347
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,000
That's nice.

348
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,000
Chill.

349
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,000
Some pretty music.

350
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:15,000
I mean, there's nothing that says that an atheist can't go to can't go to church and

351
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:20,000
you're not going to burst into flames as soon as you cross the threshold of the building.

352
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,000
You're not voting either.

353
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,000
Like it's not like I'm for it.

354
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
I'm for what's happening.

355
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:27,000
You're just there to in respect for your family.

356
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:31,000
You would go to you would go to a church if a friend were getting married.

357
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,000
I would think of this the same way.

358
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,000
Yeah.

359
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
Well, we really knocked that one out of the park.

360
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
Finally, some actual help.

361
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:41,000
Should we I think should we should we talk about our Christmas?

362
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,000
We're going to holiday.

363
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,000
Our holiday.

364
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,000
No, fuck that.

365
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,000
You can't kill my Christmas.

366
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,000
I'll take questions.

367
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,000
I'll take Hanukkah queries.

368
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:52,000
I'll be the Hanukkah query guy.

369
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,000
So we're going to do a holiday.

370
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,000
Can we call it?

371
00:18:54,000 --> 00:19:02,000
Can we call it ha ha ha ha ha like ha ha ha ha because we're going to we're going to make

372
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,000
it funny.

373
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:06,000
Like I'm sure we'll have a wonderful name for it by the time it rolls around.

374
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:10,000
But we're going to be doing that on Christmas, Hanukkah, Christmas, Hanukkah.

375
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,000
Get it.

376
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
If you have we're going to do all holiday questions.

377
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:20,000
So if you have a if you've been waiting to get on the show and you have holiday questions

378
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:28,000
and you want you want to ask them to us, make sure you get them to us by let's say the 17th

379
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:31,000
of this month and and we will address those.

380
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:36,000
I also like to hear about even if we don't end up using these, I'd like to have people

381
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:39,500
write in about their traditions and ask us if they're weird or not.

382
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:40,500
Oh, I like that.

383
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:41,500
Yeah, I like that.

384
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:43,880
It's sort of in the advice and advice realm.

385
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:47,600
We usually ask that people don't ask about poop and masturbation.

386
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:52,320
And I think for this, our holiday special, we can repeal that.

387
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:55,200
No, I mean, we need the extra don't extra.

388
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:56,200
Don't do it.

389
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:57,200
Don't do not do it.

390
00:19:57,200 --> 00:20:02,360
I want this to be an episode where when you travel to your family's home, to the to your

391
00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:07,720
home's place, your ancestral home, you can say, here, let's gather around the fire and

392
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:08,720
enjoy this together.

393
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:09,720
I like that.

394
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:13,280
And maybe when I edit the show, I can edit out all the curse words so that Jingle Bell

395
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:15,980
sounds and then add in different curse words.

396
00:20:15,980 --> 00:20:21,000
So I can be like, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck.

397
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:25,960
And all you'll hear is Jingle Bells and it'll make a song that you forget and it'll be like

398
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:28,280
don't forget, sorry, grandpa.

399
00:20:28,280 --> 00:20:30,600
The best episode.

400
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:34,240
So make sure you get those questions in.

401
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:38,120
I currently have a boyfriend shaped hole in my life that I'm trying to fix.

402
00:20:38,120 --> 00:20:40,040
For pretty much my entire dating life.

403
00:20:40,040 --> 00:20:43,400
I've jumped from long term relationship to long term relationship with whatever best

404
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:44,840
guy friend I had at the time.

405
00:20:44,840 --> 00:20:47,760
And consequently, I've never really dated or hooked up with anyone.

406
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:48,760
I'm 20 right now.

407
00:20:48,760 --> 00:20:51,940
And I think the last time I was really single was when I was 14.

408
00:20:51,940 --> 00:20:55,720
My friends have been telling me I need to go crazy and get down with some random dudes,

409
00:20:55,720 --> 00:20:59,040
which sounds intriguing, but I miss the reliability of having a relationship.

410
00:20:59,040 --> 00:21:00,920
What should I do in BNB AM?

411
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:03,880
Love always alone and indecisive Gmail.

412
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:09,280
Oh, well, um, your friends sound like they give terrible advice.

413
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:10,280
I don't trust your friends.

414
00:21:10,280 --> 00:21:11,280
Do they have a show?

415
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:12,280
I didn't think so.

416
00:21:12,280 --> 00:21:13,280
No.

417
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:17,800
Um, I don't think that that's the going crazy with a bunch of random dudes.

418
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:24,000
I don't, I don't see that there's like, it's a big risk and you risk, I don't know, hurt

419
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,680
somebody or get hurt yourself.

420
00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:27,980
It's never a good advice.

421
00:21:27,980 --> 00:21:32,360
And with stuff like that, I like to take it and try to apply it to different situations

422
00:21:32,360 --> 00:21:34,640
and being like, you know, I just lost my job.

423
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:35,680
What should you do?

424
00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:38,280
Get a bunch of jobs and then quit them.

425
00:21:38,280 --> 00:21:42,160
That's not good advice for any situation.

426
00:21:42,160 --> 00:21:43,160
Like I just finished a diet.

427
00:21:43,160 --> 00:21:44,160
What should I do?

428
00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:45,160
Eat a bunch of food.

429
00:21:45,160 --> 00:21:48,800
Like, no, that's not a good advice to take for any situation.

430
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:49,800
Yeah.

431
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:52,880
I just don't, I don't think that that's a, have fun.

432
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:53,880
Yeah.

433
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:58,080
I don't look, but let's see, here's, here's the problem with this whole thing.

434
00:21:58,080 --> 00:22:05,240
People you can't give advice on how to proceed, like with your relationship in general.

435
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:06,720
Like here's what you should do next.

436
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:10,320
Here's the type of relationship you can pursue cause we don't control when these things happen.

437
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:11,880
We don't control the type of people we meet.

438
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:14,480
We don't control the type of relationship we get into.

439
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:19,940
I mean, if it's the person that you, if it's somebody who can make you really happy, why

440
00:22:19,940 --> 00:22:22,540
would you just randomly bail out?

441
00:22:22,540 --> 00:22:26,440
The best advice I can give is to not try to do anything.

442
00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:29,760
Just live your life and you know what happens, happens.

443
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:33,880
Don't set the mindset of I'm going to go out and get crazy and get down with a bunch of

444
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:34,880
random dudes.

445
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:39,080
No, because then you're trying to manipulate how that works and that's not a good way to

446
00:22:39,080 --> 00:22:40,080
go.

447
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:43,600
Also, but you don't want to go out and say, I'm going to find true love because then you're

448
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:45,840
trying to manipulate it the other way.

449
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:48,120
Just be yourself, live your life.

450
00:22:48,120 --> 00:22:49,200
What happens, happens.

451
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:50,600
We are saying this though.

452
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:55,960
You're giving this person this advice because we have all done this thing where we get out

453
00:22:55,960 --> 00:23:00,580
of a long term relationship or at least I, God knows I have, like I got out of a long

454
00:23:00,580 --> 00:23:06,160
term relationship and then all of a sudden, you know, I, my eyes were opened and I, I

455
00:23:06,160 --> 00:23:11,080
went crazy as you said and I think that I got down with a bunch of random dudes, got

456
00:23:11,080 --> 00:23:14,160
down with just so many random dudes and I think the reason that three of us are saying

457
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:18,200
it's a bad idea is because we did it and we know it's a bad idea and I think that may

458
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:19,440
just be something you have to do.

459
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:24,080
I think you may just have to have the, the bad idea part of your life.

460
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:25,560
I think you need to have that.

461
00:23:25,560 --> 00:23:26,560
I think that's important.

462
00:23:26,560 --> 00:23:27,560
Well, okay.

463
00:23:27,560 --> 00:23:28,560
Well, let's compromise.

464
00:23:28,560 --> 00:23:33,000
If you do do that, that's fine, but don't set out to do that because your friends told

465
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:34,000
you to.

466
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:37,080
Like if that's what happens, that's cool.

467
00:23:37,080 --> 00:23:44,080
I think that that's a better, I think maybe a way to sort of, a way to sort of put this

468
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:50,160
in perspective, something that will be applicable to you is be more cautious of entering into

469
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:51,960
long-term relationships.

470
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:57,080
Like rather than setting out to do that, give yourself permission to get out of relationships

471
00:23:57,080 --> 00:23:58,080
if they're not working.

472
00:23:58,080 --> 00:24:03,920
And I mean early, I mean like three dates, it's not working, bail and do go on dates.

473
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:08,800
I think that that's something else that, that maybe your friends are getting around to.

474
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:12,280
And maybe that, that's something that could work for you in a less harmful way.

475
00:24:12,280 --> 00:24:16,800
Don't just go with friends, you know, go on some actual dates with people.

476
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:17,800
Yeah.

477
00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:18,800
In your twenties?

478
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:19,800
Yeah.

479
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:20,800
In your twenties?

480
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:22,120
This is, this is when you, this is when you start dating.

481
00:24:22,120 --> 00:24:23,120
And I'm going to sound like an old man.

482
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:24,120
If you have more mature dates.

483
00:24:24,120 --> 00:24:25,120
Yeah.

484
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:26,120
You're, you're so young though.

485
00:24:26,120 --> 00:24:32,840
You have so much time, you know, just enjoy yourself and you know, go have fun responsibly.

486
00:24:32,840 --> 00:24:33,920
Yeah.

487
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:36,520
Just go out there and just get your dick wet.

488
00:24:36,520 --> 00:24:37,520
Okay.

489
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:38,520
Not.

490
00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:39,520
All right.

491
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:40,520
Not quite.

492
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:41,520
It's 2010.

493
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:42,520
Okay.

494
00:24:42,520 --> 00:24:43,520
Women have dicks.

495
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:44,520
What?

496
00:24:44,520 --> 00:24:45,520
Griffin, how about a Yahoo?

497
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:46,520
Yeah, sure.

498
00:24:46,520 --> 00:24:53,040
God, I had so many good ones this week.

499
00:24:53,040 --> 00:24:54,760
Thank you everybody who sent them in.

500
00:24:54,760 --> 00:24:58,040
This one was sent in by Action Allen.

501
00:24:58,040 --> 00:25:08,600
It's by Yahoo Answers user Shane S. who asks, how to gel pubes and what styles are there?

502
00:25:08,600 --> 00:25:13,320
I am a guy and my boyfriend says he finds it sexy for my pubes to be gelled.

503
00:25:13,320 --> 00:25:16,000
Anyone know any styles for my pubes to be gelled?

504
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,560
Give me a detailed process.

505
00:25:18,560 --> 00:25:19,560
Additional details.

506
00:25:19,560 --> 00:25:21,720
I use gel that I use for the hair on my head.

507
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:22,720
Why?

508
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:25,200
What happens if it's an alcohol product?

509
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:26,600
I don't know about that.

510
00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:28,800
I would like some serious answers.

511
00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:31,240
Anyone know any styles for gelling pubes?

512
00:25:31,240 --> 00:25:32,460
I got a few.

513
00:25:32,460 --> 00:25:34,680
Is there anyone who gelled their pubes before?

514
00:25:34,680 --> 00:25:36,280
Preferably an answer from a guy.

515
00:25:36,280 --> 00:25:38,480
I'm going to have sex tonight.

516
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:41,520
Please answer.

517
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:45,920
I like the Gabe Kaplan which is a bunch of curly on top and then a row of straight right

518
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:46,920
underneath it.

519
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:47,920
I like that.

520
00:25:47,920 --> 00:25:49,440
I think that that's a real great look.

521
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:52,320
And the current top too if you have time to dye it.

522
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:56,700
I like the high top fade with some racing stripes in the side and your basketball number

523
00:25:56,700 --> 00:25:57,700
in the back.

524
00:25:57,700 --> 00:25:58,760
I like that.

525
00:25:58,760 --> 00:26:03,880
How about the Joni Loves Chachi which is where you basically you give your penis sideburns

526
00:26:03,880 --> 00:26:08,800
and then like a little pompadour up on top.

527
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:09,800
All these are good.

528
00:26:09,800 --> 00:26:11,000
Also spray tan your penis.

529
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:12,560
That's an important step for that one.

530
00:26:12,560 --> 00:26:13,560
Yeah.

531
00:26:13,560 --> 00:26:14,560
But just your penis.

532
00:26:14,560 --> 00:26:17,240
You could try the Twilight is very popular.

533
00:26:17,240 --> 00:26:22,240
That's where you put a bunch of glitter down there and when you hit the sunlight and I

534
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:27,760
am assuming you're making love in the daytime it will sparkle and that's something that

535
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:32,380
a lot of guys are really into.

536
00:26:32,380 --> 00:26:34,240
You can try the MC Hammer too.

537
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:35,240
What's that about?

538
00:26:35,240 --> 00:26:40,080
Well the MC Hammer is where you have just three straight lines carved into the side

539
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:49,720
and then directly below it you've sort of like two billowy legs of pubes that shimmy

540
00:26:49,720 --> 00:26:53,520
back and forth as you as you sway and jostle.

541
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:55,720
So like a Fu Manchu.

542
00:26:55,720 --> 00:26:57,320
Oh the Fu Manchu is very different yeah.

543
00:26:57,320 --> 00:26:58,320
Out of pubes.

544
00:26:58,320 --> 00:26:59,320
Oh it is.

545
00:26:59,320 --> 00:27:01,400
So you basically make legs out of your pubic hair.

546
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:02,400
Yeah hammer pants.

547
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:04,320
You make hammer pants out of your pubic hair.

548
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:11,320
You could also do the Uncle Jesse which is just a lovely bouffant of hair on top and

549
00:27:11,320 --> 00:27:15,360
then when you take off your pants just scream have mercy.

550
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:23,720
Well you should be doing that anyway regardless of how you decide to style your downtown Maine

551
00:27:23,720 --> 00:27:28,680
it's important that you all have mercy every time you expose your penis to your partner.

552
00:27:28,680 --> 00:27:34,560
I like the young Einstein which involves electricity and patience.

553
00:27:34,560 --> 00:27:37,080
Oh Jesus.

554
00:27:37,080 --> 00:27:41,640
Looking for something low maintenance try the Sasquatch.

555
00:27:41,640 --> 00:27:42,940
That would that's let it go.

556
00:27:42,940 --> 00:27:47,800
Now we're getting off the subject because he obviously wants gel to be up in the mix

557
00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:50,920
and that's a very that's a very natural look the Sasquatch.

558
00:27:50,920 --> 00:27:55,120
There's at least three different Elvi you can do too by the way there's young Elvis

559
00:27:55,120 --> 00:28:02,520
there's fatter there's fat sparkly Elvis and then there's the Elvis Costello where you

560
00:28:02,520 --> 00:28:08,360
hot glue glasses upside down on your balls right.

561
00:28:08,360 --> 00:28:10,080
I like the gonzo.

562
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:11,080
What's that?

563
00:28:11,080 --> 00:28:19,280
You just keep bending your penis till it forms a permanent nose and then you make Jesus Christ.

564
00:28:19,280 --> 00:28:21,880
Travis I'm sorry but that that doesn't have anything to do with hair.

565
00:28:21,880 --> 00:28:22,880
You're disqualified.

566
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:26,360
Oh damn it.

567
00:28:26,360 --> 00:28:30,360
So I guess since Travis is disqualified the game is over and who won?

568
00:28:30,360 --> 00:28:31,360
All of us.

569
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:32,360
And none of us.

570
00:28:32,360 --> 00:28:35,960
Except anyone who does any of the things we just said to do.

571
00:28:35,960 --> 00:28:36,960
They are the loser.

572
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:40,680
I'm having some trouble staying awake at work.

573
00:28:40,680 --> 00:28:45,840
My job begins at 7 a.m. but I have to wake up at least 5 15 because I take a bus and

574
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:47,400
a train to work.

575
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:50,240
The bus and train trips are short enough that I cannot sleep on them.

576
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:54,280
I usually go to sleep by 10 p.m. No drugs or coffee please.

577
00:28:54,280 --> 00:28:55,280
Help me in BNBA.

578
00:28:55,280 --> 00:28:56,280
You're my only.

579
00:28:56,280 --> 00:29:00,160
That's from Gabriel Gmail.

580
00:29:00,160 --> 00:29:01,160
Does he deserve?

581
00:29:01,160 --> 00:29:05,920
I mean if you're gonna shut us down like from the get by saying no drugs or coffee like

582
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:10,880
do we even I don't think he deserves our if you're not gonna open your mind to the two

583
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:20,200
best options because if you won't if you won't do drugs and you won't do coffee and I mean

584
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:25,080
gotta carve out some nap time like you've got to get better at falling asleep on the train yeah

585
00:29:25,720 --> 00:29:30,040
well don't do that because you'll get fucking you'll wake up with your shirt you have to learn

586
00:29:30,040 --> 00:29:37,400
to hover right above that falling asleep point right before you pass out and so you like you

587
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:44,440
get the rest but you don't miss your stop you're on that inception tip yeah that's exactly what it is

588
00:29:44,440 --> 00:29:52,280
um is it maybe he says no drugs or coffee do you think that it's a mutually exclusive thing if

589
00:29:52,280 --> 00:29:58,680
do you think if we suggested drugs and coffee oh that's cool um because i sometimes i'll take a

590
00:29:58,680 --> 00:30:06,840
few uh nice uh meth crystals uh none of that foggy shit just pure glass and i'll uh you know

591
00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:11,720
i'll crack that up and toss it in my folders instant mix uh and that'll usually keep me up

592
00:30:11,720 --> 00:30:19,720
for about three or four days until my teeth stop itching the the problem is is your job

593
00:30:19,720 --> 00:30:25,800
starts way too early and so by the time yeah by the time you hit like if you hit like noon

594
00:30:26,440 --> 00:30:32,280
you've only been to work for five hours but you've been up for seven and you only slept

595
00:30:32,280 --> 00:30:37,320
for seven the night before so like you're using up your sleepy time yeah you need a new career path

596
00:30:37,320 --> 00:30:43,400
but that's the thing is like he can take a nap after work but by that point it's too late he's

597
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:50,280
tired at work it's bedtime the thing is you need to decide is it you need to have a lifestyle change

598
00:30:50,280 --> 00:30:55,240
uh you can either take naps like all the time which would just depress you uh you could change

599
00:30:55,240 --> 00:31:00,360
your career which you probably don't want to do because any job i've found starts at 7 a.m is

600
00:31:00,360 --> 00:31:04,520
usually something you had to work really hard to get in the first place um or you could just get

601
00:31:04,520 --> 00:31:11,160
down on that meth espresso like that's the easiest option is to just chug some espresso

602
00:31:11,160 --> 00:31:16,280
every morning except on the weekends um because if you do it if you do it every day you'll i mean

603
00:31:16,280 --> 00:31:20,600
you will die there and the good news is and i can tell you this from personal experience

604
00:31:20,600 --> 00:31:26,440
eventually your biological clock will balance out and you won't be sleepy at that point you'll

605
00:31:26,440 --> 00:31:31,880
be going to bed at like 8 30 at night but your body will get used to waking up at like 5 15

606
00:31:31,880 --> 00:31:37,800
now if you've been doing this already for like two years and you still can't stay up then i have bad

607
00:31:37,800 --> 00:31:43,880
news this isn't the job for you because your body's not gonna balance out it doesn't agree with you

608
00:31:43,880 --> 00:31:53,480
yeah what do you do at a party where you only know one person gmail leave leave leave leave

609
00:31:53,480 --> 00:31:59,800
immediately leave say this party is fun for everyone but me i'm out because that's worse than

610
00:31:59,800 --> 00:32:04,280
being at a party where you know zero people yeah at a party you know zero people you can go get

611
00:32:04,280 --> 00:32:09,640
really drunk and you know make some friends and do some crazy shit if you know just one person

612
00:32:09,640 --> 00:32:15,720
you're either just gonna hang around them and make a total boob out of yourself or uh you'll do the

613
00:32:15,720 --> 00:32:21,560
you'll get drunk and uh then the friend will tell all your other friends what a what a boob you were

614
00:32:21,560 --> 00:32:27,400
it's a lose lose this is lose this is one of those situations where if you're a really super outgoing

615
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:33,720
person this is your chance to make friends if you're not this is not the time to try this is

616
00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:38,680
the time to go home yeah yeah you got the odds at least have to be in your favor you at least have

617
00:32:38,680 --> 00:32:44,280
to have a majority yeah and then meet new people that way but but this is not a good scene for you

618
00:32:44,280 --> 00:32:49,160
if you don't already know the answer to it then you shouldn't be in it i know i would be like

619
00:32:49,160 --> 00:32:59,080
if you didn't have if you if the ratio wasn't 75% people you know at a party you would you

620
00:32:59,080 --> 00:33:04,680
would take right off who's who's you just me yeah me i would do that well it this is a chance that

621
00:33:04,680 --> 00:33:09,000
you need to be preemptive in this and when your friend's like hey let's go to a party and when

622
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:14,840
you're like who am i gonna know there and they're like me don't go to that party yeah i mean

623
00:33:14,840 --> 00:33:19,000
everybody does that right yeah that's totally totally within your rights don't beat yourself

624
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:23,640
up about this yeah give them a break this is one of those things where you always kind of

625
00:33:23,640 --> 00:33:28,360
feel rude asking the question who's gonna be there but it's for situations like that that

626
00:33:28,360 --> 00:33:33,320
you ask it so it's important that you say like not that i don't want to hang out with you but

627
00:33:33,320 --> 00:33:38,520
if that's the case why don't we just go somewhere else we'll go see a movie and i don't want to go

628
00:33:38,520 --> 00:33:45,640
to a party where i don't know anyone sure dear sweet mbmb am my bf says he wants to change and

629
00:33:45,640 --> 00:33:50,040
is thinking of dying his hair blue and then he said or maybe i'll get a tattoo i think both

630
00:33:50,040 --> 00:33:55,400
ideas are terrible i don't keep him from doing anything silly but still satiate his need for

631
00:33:55,400 --> 00:34:01,000
change asked david from form spring encourage him to dye his hair blue verse get a tattoo because

632
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:10,440
at least that's not permanent yeah um let me let me ask you this david i agree i i i i understand

633
00:34:10,440 --> 00:34:18,440
where you're coming from but why is it so important to you that they not do this like don't

634
00:34:18,440 --> 00:34:23,560
you love your bf the way he is because i would think that if it's somebody you really care about

635
00:34:23,560 --> 00:34:29,720
then you would want them to get get if they want to ink if that's important to them to to do that

636
00:34:29,720 --> 00:34:36,840
then then uh well let me let me counter argument that justin if he says or maybe i'll get a tattoo

637
00:34:36,840 --> 00:34:43,560
it doesn't really sound like it's a super passionate thing yeah that's true it sounds like

638
00:34:43,560 --> 00:34:50,120
your boyfriend is bored with something else maybe his job is boring or he's having family troubles

639
00:34:50,120 --> 00:34:56,280
or you know he's just been around his small town too much and so he's trying to you know uh strike

640
00:34:56,280 --> 00:35:01,720
out from other directions instead of dealing with the problem that he has so i think you need to talk

641
00:35:01,720 --> 00:35:06,280
to him be like hey what do you really want to change because i guarantee it's not your hair or a

642
00:35:06,280 --> 00:35:11,880
tattoo that's a good wow that was actually insightful travis thank you maybe you could take

643
00:35:11,880 --> 00:35:18,040
up a pipe and yeah that's the new jam right that's the new thing you are you getting in front of that

644
00:35:18,040 --> 00:35:22,360
is that going to be like a 2011 i'm gonna get i'm gonna get out there and say 2011 let's do pipes

645
00:35:22,360 --> 00:35:27,960
let's get pipes let's smell good that's a big change and it's healthy isn't it makes you look

646
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:33,800
awesome and it makes you look so cool i well if you do it right yeah snooker one right now i love it

647
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:40,120
um i yeah i think travis is is is on the right track now now if it is just a not sometimes

648
00:35:40,120 --> 00:35:45,000
everybody gets those momentary impulses where they say hey i i need something different uh let

649
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:50,440
me suggest this to you david maybe some travel maybe you guys could take a weekend go someplace

650
00:35:50,440 --> 00:35:55,560
completely new someplace you've never been before um and and then when you return your familiarity

651
00:35:55,560 --> 00:36:02,520
uh will be a comfort rather than a burden also a pet i like a pet pet's always fun it's good

652
00:36:02,520 --> 00:36:09,960
a pet is good uh maybe an eyes wide shut style sex cult hey get fully sex caught up on that hey

653
00:36:09,960 --> 00:36:16,680
maybe 100 sex cult maybe uh start listening to the cult and that's what craigslist is for

654
00:36:16,680 --> 00:36:24,520
yep uh yeah i got i got one i've been staring at it the whole show it's like a deep dark pit

655
00:36:25,080 --> 00:36:30,520
this this question uh i think we just got to dive into it even though we don't know where it'll

what the fuck are you talking about aurora song like what are we doing

681
00:39:25,880 --> 00:39:34,040
this is this horrifying truth that we've unearthed with this show is that there are whole other

682
00:39:34,040 --> 00:39:41,080
worlds yeah there are whole other things that that don't connect to us like we don't have any

683
00:39:41,080 --> 00:39:46,840
any um any vines into them reaching into them to give us some connection it's a it's a completely

684
00:39:46,840 --> 00:39:51,400
different planet that's just spinning wildly of its own accord some wild misconceptions about

685
00:39:51,400 --> 00:39:55,240
the furry community that i feel like we now understand and and totally accept into our

686
00:39:55,240 --> 00:40:03,160
hearts and collective minds but what the little song what i mean bramble pelt snowy pelt brambles

high what are we doing here child jump i'm not angry i'm a little angry i'm scared i just want

688
00:40:09,320 --> 00:40:14,120

689
00:40:14,120 --> 00:40:18,840

695
00:40:57,560 --> 00:41:02,440
listeners who know exactly like what this is like what a warrior are freaky listen you know they

696
00:41:02,440 --> 00:41:09,640
will there's one guy right now who's like brambly pretty good i knew i listed this show for some

697
00:41:09,640 --> 00:41:16,920
reason oh god oh god i have a friend who has recently started dating a new girl the only weird

698
00:41:16,920 --> 00:41:21,880
thing is that her best friend is a boy who is gay none of us in the group have a problem with her or

699
00:41:21,880 --> 00:41:27,320
her gay friend whatsoever the thing that is bothering us is the fact that our friend and her

700
00:41:27,320 --> 00:41:31,320
will sit in the living room and her gay friend will start to do weird things like rub her feet

701
00:41:31,320 --> 00:41:36,120
while they cuddle on the couch which makes us all ridiculously uncomfortable our friend has even

702
00:41:36,120 --> 00:41:41,240
told us that her gay friend snuggles with her in bed and when our friend is in bed at the same time

703
00:41:42,200 --> 00:41:48,200
yeah that would be weird if that's not how it worked out no no no this means it's gay friend

704
00:41:48,200 --> 00:41:56,440
girl her boyfriend okay yeah in the same oh my god yeah the real mind-boggling thing is that

705
00:41:56,440 --> 00:42:02,760
our friend doesn't think this is weird when it obviously is how do we possibly break the news

706
00:42:02,760 --> 00:42:06,840
to him that this is totally not normal without offending him and tell him his girlfriend is a

707
00:42:06,840 --> 00:42:13,160
weirdo for letting this continue confused in carolina wow what this is brutal what is the

708
00:42:13,160 --> 00:42:19,320
deal with your friend that he can't realize this is weird i need to let this wave of like sadness

709
00:42:19,320 --> 00:42:27,880
just wash over me and shake it i need to absorb this okay dust flower dust flower bramble snow uh

710
00:42:27,880 --> 00:42:31,080
i just want to be there for the moment when it's like don't mind me bro i'm just gonna be down here

711
00:42:31,080 --> 00:42:36,120
rubbing her feet you guys do what you were doing well first of all that's the that's the creepiest

712
00:42:36,120 --> 00:42:40,920
thing that two human beings can do to each other like regardless of their relationship status or

713
00:42:40,920 --> 00:42:46,440
gender just like hanging out with some buds don't mind me i'm just gonna rub her naked feet yeah is

714
00:42:46,440 --> 00:42:51,800
this cool is this cool i would rather see you french kiss i would rather see two people french

715
00:42:51,800 --> 00:43:00,280
kiss than two people oh especially if it's like a mutual foot rub i think there's a good chance

716
00:43:00,280 --> 00:43:06,520
that this friend of hers the gay friend is a serial killer yeah he could be a serial killer

717
00:43:06,520 --> 00:43:12,840
now it's sad okay so so here's the here's this here's the poop on your situation the the gay

718
00:43:12,840 --> 00:43:19,800
friend is obviously in need of intimacy now he he may be very well be like super duper gay

719
00:43:19,800 --> 00:43:25,560
that's fine but the problem is that we've talked we've talked about this before that

720
00:43:25,560 --> 00:43:32,280
just like if you're dating someone that that is like has a bunch of you know gay friends it does

721
00:43:32,280 --> 00:43:38,040
not give her or any of them carte blanche to make out at any time like yeah right that's still super

722
00:43:38,040 --> 00:43:42,440
fucked up like physical intimacy and and being attracted to somebody or two very different

723
00:43:42,440 --> 00:43:49,240
things and it's still somebody who's like being intimate with your with your friend and being

724
00:43:49,240 --> 00:43:55,720
intimate in front of you and i mean i mean intimate in like the the literal yeah way like if you're

725
00:43:55,720 --> 00:44:01,720
doing things you shouldn't do in public regardless and also psychologically the physical action

726
00:44:01,720 --> 00:44:08,120
creates the mental reaction so it's like you know making yourself sick thinking about vomiting makes

727
00:44:08,120 --> 00:44:13,240
you feel sick you know and being intimate with someone even if it's you know that kind of

728
00:44:13,240 --> 00:44:20,760
of skin-to-skin friend intimacy it's still creating a weird bond there it sounds like

729
00:44:20,760 --> 00:44:25,720
this girl is serving as like i don't know a security blanket for the gay friend where she's

730
00:44:25,720 --> 00:44:30,600
just like this outlet for intimacy or it's vice versa i mean oh yeah that's also very possible

731
00:44:30,600 --> 00:44:36,040
it's it's just fucked up like it's it's rude what's weird though is none of the three people

732
00:44:36,040 --> 00:44:41,720
in this situation like directly in the situation think it's weird the gay friend doesn't think

733
00:44:41,720 --> 00:44:44,680
it's weird the girlfriend doesn't think it's weird the boyfriend doesn't think it's weird

734
00:44:45,480 --> 00:44:51,960
so that's a good that's a good point i mean is it within her friend's right to to uh

735
00:44:53,880 --> 00:44:56,840
you know to to infringe on this and tell people how to live their lives

736
00:44:57,880 --> 00:45:04,920
yeah it seems like this would be someone else's call but you are totally within your rights to

737
00:45:04,920 --> 00:45:10,600
look at it and go man that's weird your job is to not hang out with them anymore because that's

738
00:45:10,600 --> 00:45:14,120
weird your job tell them that you're making they're making you uncomfortable i mean i don't

739
00:45:14,120 --> 00:45:19,320
hear anything wrong with that saying like hey i know you're like you're way gay like super duper

740
00:45:19,320 --> 00:45:24,120
gay but that you're still rubbing please stop touching feet yeah please thank you walk on those

741
00:45:24,120 --> 00:45:30,840
you walk over walking your feet live in your shoes like this is all this is all just topsy-turvy but

742
00:45:30,840 --> 00:45:35,080
see but no here's the one point where i'll disagree there it is not our listener the person

743
00:45:35,080 --> 00:45:39,880
who wrote the question and it's not your job to talk to the gay friend you get to talk to your

744
00:45:39,880 --> 00:45:44,920
friend and be like dude i'm not telling you to do anything i'm just telling you this creeps me out

745
00:45:44,920 --> 00:45:49,000
and i'm not gonna hang out with the three of you anymore yeah you're weirding me out yeah

746
00:45:49,640 --> 00:45:56,120
because it's weirding me out and i don't know them bramble pelt bramble snow flurry cat eyes
