1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:30,640
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:48,960
Hello everybody, welcome, my brother, my brother and me, Super Bowl Watch 2015. I'm your oldest

6
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:56,080
brother, Justin McElroy. Bum bum bum, bum bum bum. I'm Travis McElroy. And I'm Papa John's Manning.

7
00:00:56,080 --> 00:01:05,520
That's he's fused with. He has become one. He has been absorbed by the pizza chain known as Papa

8
00:01:05,520 --> 00:01:11,680
John's, and he is one with them. All is right with the world. I'm Papa John's Manning. You know,

9
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:16,560
a lot of people say they only want Super Bowl's coming up next Sunday before our next episode

10
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:23,840
comes out. So we just wanted to open the door a little bit for the sports enthusiasts to finally

11
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:34,640
find a place where we can really talk ball. And puck? Well, big game is coming up

12
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:39,760
Sunday. A lot of people say they only watch it for the ads. You know what I watch it for? What?

13
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:48,400
The cheerleaders. Hello. It's a sport, Griffin. They don't even have those anymore. That's my

14
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:55,520
engine. When was the last time you watched a football game and saw cheerleaders? They don't,

15
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:59,200
I don't think they have them anymore. The last one I watched was that Patriots game where they

16
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:07,600
had deflated the cheerleaders. They didn't perform as well. Just sort of warbling around on the

17
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:12,240
sidelines. Didn't really get anybody, especially psych, but that did not stop the Patriots from

18
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:17,840
coming away with a big decisive victory over the Indiana Colts. It did make me wonder what they

19
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:21,360
thought the end game of that would be. Like maybe if we a little bit, a little bit of the blood out

20
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:25,440
of our cheerleaders, they'll be better. I don't know. I'm really looking forward to the big game.

21
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:29,600
Are you looking for the big game? Who's in it this year? A lot of people are still wondering.

22
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:37,520
Well, we have to wait and see who shows up. Well, I think that's part of it. Cause you default if

23
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:42,080
you don't get there in time and with traffic these days. Oh my God. Where is that movie?

24
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:47,520
What about trying to get to the Super Bowl? Yeah. Like they all oversleep in new

25
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:51,920
England and they have to like get to Denver or wherever they're doing the Super Bowl this year.

26
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:56,400
But then they forget Kevin at home. Yeah. Oh my God. We forgot Tom Brady.

27
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:59,200
And it just shows him like in his underwear sliding around the house.

28
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:06,880
That's his aftershave bit. Him and Giselle have to fight off Joe Pesci. None of this is good so far.

29
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:12,800
This is all very bad. You said everything we've done ever is funny. And the streak ends today.

30
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:19,280
Why won't people sit next to me on the bus?

31
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:26,480
Every morning on my way to work, I'm one of the first to get on the bus. As the bus fills up,

32
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:31,760
I end up being the last person sitting alone. People will often opt to stand before sitting

33
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:38,080
next to me. I'm very quiet, fairly well dressed, average looking guy who showers every morning.

34
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:42,720
Help me brothers. Am I just being paranoid or is there a method to being the cool guy on the bus?

35
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:46,480
Everyone wants to sit next to you. That's from potentially creepy bus guy in Seattle.

36
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:52,320
I totally get this and I know what it is. Oh, okay. Well, good. Just sort of putting your

37
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:57,040
foot down, huh? But just sort of putting the Travis stamp on this one. Claiming it for your own.

38
00:03:57,040 --> 00:04:03,040
You want it too bad. That might be it. Yeah. I mean, I've been that dude where it's that

39
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:06,160
idea of like- Do you do that thing where you like raise your eyebrows and pat the seat like?

40
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:12,080
Well, it's like somebody starts to walk up and you kind of like subconsciously like

41
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:16,800
adjust yourself, like preparing to make a new friend. And it's like, I want to look the most

42
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:21,040
normal now. And it's like, Oh, what's that guy wiggling about? I don't want to sit next to the

43
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:29,440
wiggly dude. Are you maybe whenever anybody walks by, you maybe go seats taken. Just like a nervous

44
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:38,400
tick. Yeah. Can't sit here. If you forgot to mention that bit, that is some primo, primo

45
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:44,000
background that we definitely, definitely needed. I honestly, I think that a part of it is in this

46
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:52,000
day and age being a perfectly normal, like average looking dude is for some reason become like a huge

47
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,760
red flag. Well, yeah, because those are the hate crimers. Those are the people who like fuck up

48
00:04:55,760 --> 00:05:01,520
the worst. It's never our profiling has been flipped on its ear because the people who want

49
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:06,720
to do heinous shit know they're going to get away with it if they put on some fucking H&M.

50
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:12,320
Like I've watched so much CSI and shit, and it's always like the normal looking dude. That's like

51
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:17,760
the serial killer. It's never the big bearded tattooed biker guy. He's the guy who volunteers

52
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:21,840
his time on the weekends at like the big brother's big sister's house, you know, whatever. And it's

53
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:27,600
like, okay, he's actually a good guy who just lives his life every day. And he's just made some

54
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:32,960
interesting like, you know, outfit choices today. It's the normal looking dude who puts people in

55
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:40,320
freezers. Are people just too polite? Like for me, if I'm on a bus or like an airport shuttle,

56
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:48,480
maybe, you know, from one terminal to the next, if there's an open seat and the only one is like

57
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:54,320
next to people, I will probably stand. I will probably go ahead and stand. I don't want to be

58
00:05:54,320 --> 00:06:00,800
the guy that ruined somebody's day by touching them, cramming in next to them. You don't want

59
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:07,840
to make that human connection, that most blissful human experience of sweet, soft human touch.

60
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:12,000
I'm also, if it's like the last seat, I'm also very nervous that somewhere on there,

61
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:16,240
there's a pregnant woman that I just haven't spotted and somebody-

62
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:17,600
And you'll accidentally sit on her?

63
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:24,560
No, like she's standing. People are looking at me like, look at, look at, look at-

64
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:30,240
Justin's not suggesting that, honey, I shrunk you and you're pregnant is a thing.

65
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:31,360
No, I'm saying-

66
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:32,560
She could also be invisible.

67
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:36,960
Yeah, invisible pregnant women on buses are getting to be a pretty serious issue.

68
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:38,240
Hey, Obama.

69
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:42,480
And the third trimester, ladies just turn invisible. I don't get it.

70
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:47,120
It's a one in a hundred kind of chance, but as a side effect of pregnancy, invisibility-

71
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:49,520
Sorry, a one in a hundred?

72
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:53,520
Yep. It's becoming more and more prevalent as we put GMOs into more stuff.

73
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:56,960
Ugh, GMOs turning all our pregnant women invisible. Cut it out, GMOs.

74
00:06:56,960 --> 00:07:01,360
GMO, you've done it again.

75
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:04,880
Smooched another tiny, invisible pregnant woman.

76
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:09,840
Is GMO the tiny alien from the Flintstones?

77
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:10,720
Yes, I have-

78
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:15,280
Hey, GMO, I've come to turn all your pregnant women invisible.

79
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:15,780
GMO!

80
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:20,240
Can I ask why this is bothering you?

81
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:25,040
Wilma, why are you, why are you invisible, Wilma? What haven't you told me?

82
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:30,240
Well, Fred, this is what I sound like on the cartoon, I think.

83
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:34,880
I'm pregnant, I didn't know how to tell you, but now that I'm invisible, I guess you guessed it.

84
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:42,080
Can I ask why this is a problem for you? Why this is bothering you that you're not-

85
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:44,800
I mean, I get it. I love that sweet, blissful,

86
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:50,080
celestial human interaction of a soft thigh-to-thigh touch.

87
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:55,600
I'm real into that through the jeans stuff, but that might not be everybody's cup of tea.

88
00:07:56,720 --> 00:08:00,240
It seems like it wouldn't bother Justin if people didn't sit next to you on a bus.

89
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:02,720
That actually seems like it would be kind of a superpower for you.

90
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:07,760
I bet it's like this, Gervin. I bet it's like the first time it happened, he was like,

91
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:11,040
ah, awesome, great, see it all to myself. The second time he was like,

92
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:15,600
what are the odds? Twice in a row. And then by like the 32nd time, he was like,

93
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:18,320
do I smell? Like, what is the thing? What's going on?

94
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:23,040
This is honestly more of a concern to me on like a plane.

95
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:29,760
I used to fly a lot more before we had the kiddo, and I can remember very clearly being like

96
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:35,280
in the middle seat of a plane and not having anyone on the left.

97
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:39,600
And the plane, they're doing that thing where it's like, I don't see any more people coming on.

98
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:43,280
Oh my God. And I'm already like planning how I'm gonna stretch out.

99
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:46,960
Like how quick I'm gonna get that armrest up and put my bag underneath there

100
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:52,160
and put my Diet Mountain Dew inside the thing and take his SkyMall and keep that one.

101
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:55,520
Build a friend out of magazines and sit in the chair next to you,

102
00:08:56,160 --> 00:09:00,000
turn to him and say, oh my God, are you watching this movie? Maze Runner's amazing.

103
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:04,320
Tell him that my wife is in the bathroom and or pregnant and invisible

104
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:07,280
and go ahead and just leave her meal there. And or made of magazines.

105
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:14,800
And I've got all these great plans. And then just Johnny come latest,

106
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:18,800
then just strolling up the aisle. Oh, I think this is, yeah, I bet it is.

107
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:22,880
I bet that is your seat there. Go ahead. And it's always,

108
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:29,040
the only thing worse than that, the stinkiest salad in the entire Aeropuerto.

109
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:33,120
Like the stinkiest. He went to every restaurant, smelled the salads.

110
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:36,320
No, no, no, no, no, no, no. Too fresh. Too fresh smelling.

111
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:37,520
Do you have any with garbage?

112
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:41,600
Do you have any from like a week ago that you forgot to refrigerate?

113
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:46,640
Do you have any from a week ago that have Vienna sausages toasted into croutons?

114
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:48,960
Could you put that on here? That would be great.

115
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:56,080
The worst moment to me on a plane is when you walk on and someone is like sitting in your seat.

116
00:09:56,080 --> 00:10:00,800
And like that, that confrontation to me is like a Sisyphusian level of like,

117
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:08,320
hey, you see I'm actually. So, and there's like a line of people waiting to sit down behind you.

118
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:12,640
I don't know why that moment makes me so awkward, but it like, cause it's my seat.

119
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:16,080
I fucking paid for it. It's not like I'm trying to steal it from him.

120
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:18,800
And, but like the three times I've had to do that in my life,

121
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:23,040
the person responded like I was taking the cherriest seat.

122
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:24,320
What did you want me to do?

123
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:25,840
Why can't I just steal it?

124
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:32,160
Not to turn this into Seinfeld, the podcast, but the other thing about airplane.

125
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:33,680
Oh Jesus Christ.

126
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:38,560
When you have to put your bag, like 10 rolls back because it's the only one.

127
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:40,320
And then there are people still getting on the plane.

128
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:43,360
So you have to be that guy who's like fighting against the tide.

129
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:46,800
Like, yes, this is what we're doing now. Crowd surf me back to my seat.

130
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:49,040
You get a lot of that through the jeans interaction.

131
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:51,600
Yeah. We're not talking about it.

132
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:53,600
Can we actually do just a quick PSA?

133
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:55,200
Cause I feel like this is a hot topic right now.

134
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:57,600
And I feel like we need to maybe make our opinion clear on it.

135
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:03,360
I feel like the hot topic right now that everybody's talking about is like,

136
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:05,760
dude, dude, spread, spreading their legs.

137
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:08,080
Just sort of get man. Is that what it is?

138
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:11,680
Is that the, is that the scientific term is manspread?

139
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:12,320
That's correct.

140
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:14,400
Let's talk about manspread.

141
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:15,600
Keep it together.

142
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:16,800
Keep them closed.

143
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:20,880
I just got back from Pac South, San Antonio, where I covered several panels

144
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:24,640
where I was sitting in the middle of like a row between two dudes

145
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:29,680
that I just wanted to bust out like a courtesy protractor and like shove it between their junk

146
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:31,920
and just showed them how bad they were fucking up.

147
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:37,120
Just show them. I would do, I would have two protractors, one for my own ruined,

148
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:45,200
flattened peniness and their, their, their giant greater than sign that they had going on

149
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:48,400
in their pants and just show them how bad they were fucking up.

150
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:52,880
Just like do a quick measurement of how much percentile of my own cushion

151
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:57,200
they were occupying with their, with their, their meat.

152
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:58,720
I, Oh God.

153
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:03,360
If somebody does that, you just have to cross your legs so that your foot is resting on their leg.

154
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:05,920
And if they look at you, just eyeball them real hard.

155
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:09,120
I sat next to one who was like doing it so heinously that I couldn't,

156
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:11,280
I had like my laptop in my lap cause I was like taking notes.

157
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:12,160
I was covering the panel.

158
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:16,720
I had one dude that was like so heinous about it that I had to like sit off the corner of my chair

159
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:18,000
and it was like an hour long.

160
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:18,960
It was like really uncomfortable.

161
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:22,320
So after a while I just like fucking like cuddled with this guy.

162
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:24,080
Just like fucking like, nope.

163
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:28,640
Okay. I guess I have to fight for my right to like be here right now.

164
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:31,840
And I know that's not an equitable solution for everybody, especially when it's shorts weather,

165
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:36,800
but just like, Oh guys, just be constantly vigilant and alert about how you're,

166
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:40,000
how you're, how you're sort of occupying stuff.

167
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,800
If the person next to you is employee man spread,

168
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:46,640
it just start rubbing their jeans and ask them if they have a mint or some gum.

169
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:49,040
And then after they say no, keep asking.

170
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:54,800
If their jeans pocket has a mint in it and that pocket is on your cushion,

171
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:56,160
that it's your mint.

172
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:56,800
It's your shit.

173
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:57,920
Check the constitution.

174
00:12:57,920 --> 00:12:59,600
Manifest destiny, baby.

175
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:00,400
Give me that mint.

176
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:01,520
Manifest destiny.

177
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:02,240
Give me that pocket.

178
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:03,520
Manifest destiny.

179
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:04,800
Oh, that was it.

180
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:07,920
I think manifest is actually better, Travis.

181
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:09,200
How about a Yahoo answer?

182
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:11,200
I wish I'd said mine first.

183
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:12,160
How about a Yahoo?

184
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:13,440
We'll fix it in post.

185
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:15,360
How about, that's not how post works.

186
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:16,160
How about a Yahoo?

187
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:18,480
Yeah.

188
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:20,080
Can you put one in in post?

189
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:20,320
Yeah.

190
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:21,760
I'll put this Yahoo in, in post.

191
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:22,240
All right guys.

192
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:23,360
So that was a great question.

193
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:24,960
Justin, time to move on to the next one.

194
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:26,880
This Yahoo was sent in by-

195
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:28,800
You just put some jokes in there?

196
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:31,360
By a game recognized game, Rachel Sperling.

197
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:31,600
Thank you.

198
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:33,040
It's by Yahoo answers user, Rob.

199
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:39,040
Who asks, which celebrity would you like, sorry.

200
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:41,680
Which celebrity would you like to stroke your hair

201
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:42,560
if you were dying?

202
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:45,920
You are lying on your, you are lying on your death bed

203
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:48,000
and are about to merge with the infinite.

204
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:52,000
You can summon any celebrity, living or dead,

205
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,880
to stoke you hair as you fade away.

206
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:57,200
Who would it be? Harvey Fierstein.

207
00:13:57,200 --> 00:13:57,760
Oh, sorry.

208
00:13:57,760 --> 00:13:59,040
That's not in there, but just like,

209
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:00,640
I just got so excited about my answer,

210
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:02,160
but of course it'd be Harvey Fierstein.

211
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:06,480
Griffin, Griffin, you're dying.

212
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:11,840
Going to be with Jesus, gonna be with Jesus soon.

213
00:14:12,640 --> 00:14:17,120
Against all odds, Harvey Fierstein has outlived you.

214
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,600
I'll carry on your legacy.

215
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:23,280
I'll tell the tales of your bravery.

216
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:25,520
Oh wait, Griffin, I'm dying too.

217
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:28,160
Can you stroke my hair, Griffin?

218
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:29,440
We'll do like a yin yang of stroking.

219
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:33,040
We'll do a hair stroking dying 69, Griffin.

220
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:38,160
You actually sound like the female frog woman

221
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:39,680
from Rocko's Modern Life.

222
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:43,120
Thank you for jumping in the path of that bullet for me.

223
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:45,760
That muggers assailant was coming for me

224
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:46,880
and you saved my life.

225
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:48,240
You're a hero, Griffin.

226
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:50,160
Oh fuck, that would be good.

227
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:52,080
You're the greatest man I've ever met.

228
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:53,040
I'll never forget you.

229
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:54,720
It'll be good for several reasons.

230
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:56,720
One, I bet he's very tender in that situation,

231
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:59,040
but he has a good bedside manner

232
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:00,640
when somebody's shuffling off.

233
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:01,840
That's why I can hear him say,

234
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:03,120
it's okay, it's gonna be okay.

235
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:06,000
You're gonna be a piece.

236
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,320
It's hard to say shh in a Harvey Fierstein voice.

237
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:11,520
Sheesh, sheesh, sheesh.

238
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:13,680
She just sounds like a malfunctioning robot.

239
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:19,760
Also, I feel like after a few minutes of it,

240
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:20,960
I would just sort of be ready

241
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:24,560
to just not hear it anymore,

242
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:26,080
to just be like anywhere else,

243
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:28,640
including the infinite that I'm about to merge with.

244
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:31,280
I think Tommy Lee Jones would shame me

245
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:32,480
into coming back to life.

246
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:33,600
Oh shit.

247
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:34,640
What do you think you're doing?

248
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:38,160
You're trying to fall asleep, to die.

249
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:40,480
You're ready to die now?

250
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:41,440
Come back to life, coward.

251
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:44,160
I should have known that this question

252
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:45,840
was going to surface the fact

253
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:48,160
that we're fucking bad at impressions.

254
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:50,080
I don't know what you're talking about.

255
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:51,040
We are nailing these.

256
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:54,800
Now what if Tim Curry was there stroking your hair?

257
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:55,300
Griffin.

258
00:15:57,680 --> 00:16:00,880
The impression all three of us can do, slam dunk.

259
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:03,120
Griffin, I brought you a fresh cheese pizza.

260
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:09,440
It's full of adrenaline.

261
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:13,040
I'll shove it straight in your heart, Griffin.

262
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:20,720
See you met my faithful Saint Peter.

263
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:21,600
All that would be good.

264
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:24,720
I bet I would do Channing Tatum

265
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:26,800
just because I'd like to hang out with him.

266
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:28,960
The one thing that we're not addressing here

267
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:31,200
is it's great to meet these awesome celebrities,

268
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:32,480
but who's going to be the best one

269
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:33,680
at stroking your hair?

270
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:34,480
You know what I mean?

271
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:35,760
Because I think Channing Tatum

272
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:38,000
is going to end up being pretty lazy about it.

273
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,920
Yeah, and he would do a bro laugh.

274
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:42,960
Yeah, and that's not going to make you feel comfortable.

275
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:43,600
I want to be soothed.

276
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:44,000
How about this?

277
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:44,960
Let me hit you guys with this.

278
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:46,720
Dolly fucking Parton.

279
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:48,640
Oh, that's a good one.

280
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:49,680
That's very good.

281
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:50,560
I would do that today.

282
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:52,560
I would do that today.

283
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:53,520
I would die today

284
00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:55,600
if I could get Dolly Parton to stroke my hair

285
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:57,360
while I go, while I shuffle.

286
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:59,840
Can I say somebody who I think would be surprisingly good

287
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:01,040
would be Jon Favreau?

288
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:02,720
I feel like Jon Favreau.

289
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:03,280
You know what?

290
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:04,800
Yeah, because he makes it special.

291
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:06,000
He does.

292
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,760
You know, he makes everything a little fun.

293
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:10,640
You watch Zathura and you think like,

294
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:13,360
this is going to be like a dumb space Jumanji

295
00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:16,160
rip off some Dax Shepard action.

296
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:17,760
But then you know what happens there at the end?

297
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:19,360
They make it kind of special, don't they?

298
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,280
They do make it special.

299
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:22,400
What do you guys think about this?

300
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:24,000
Ving Rhames.

301
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:26,080
Damn.

302
00:17:26,080 --> 00:17:27,200
Ving Rhames.

303
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:32,000
Yeah, probably surprisingly tender.

304
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,680
I mean, he's no Michael Clark Duncan

305
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:34,880
who would have been a fantastic-

306
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:37,280
Well, this says you can summon any celebrity living or dead.

307
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:38,080
So, oh my God.

308
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:38,720
How could that?

309
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:39,360
Okay, that's-

310
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:40,160
Okay, Jesus.

311
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:40,880
Game over.

312
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:41,360
Well, no.

313
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:43,040
I'm going to summon Jesus.

314
00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:43,680
Yeah, of course.

315
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:44,080
Jesus.

316
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:44,640
Hey, what's up?

317
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:45,200
Where am I?

318
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:46,080
You're in a hospital.

319
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:46,720
I'm dying.

320
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:47,120
Cool.

321
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:47,920
So did you need anything?

322
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:48,160
Yeah.

323
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:48,960
Can I get in heaven?

324
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:49,440
I guess.

325
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:49,760
Sure.

326
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:50,400
Cool, boob.

327
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:51,440
Perfect.

328
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:51,760
Perfect.

329
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:53,920
Oh, I should have asked him to keep me from dying.

330
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:54,960
Too late.

331
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,920
No, Michael Clark Duncan would be so sick

332
00:17:57,920 --> 00:17:58,720
because he could be like,

333
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:00,080
it's pretty dope up there.

334
00:18:01,040 --> 00:18:02,480
You're going to really dig it.

335
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:03,680
Now let me stroke your hair.

336
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:04,960
I don't got any, but-

337
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:08,000
Let me open my mouth and eat your disease.

338
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,240
That's he, I told you this so many times

339
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:11,760
that that was not a documentary.

340
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:14,240
You know what?

341
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:15,520
I'm going to go back on what I said

342
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:17,120
and I'm just going to stick with the cool factor

343
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:18,160
and go with John Stamos.

344
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:19,360
Okay.

345
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:20,720
You think John Stamos would be good?

346
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:21,680
What if he tried to turn it

347
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:23,280
into a fucking yogurt commercial though?

348
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:25,760
I'm counting on that.

349
00:18:26,560 --> 00:18:27,040
You know what?

350
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:28,560
You know what?

351
00:18:28,560 --> 00:18:30,400
The last thing I'd want in my mouth is

352
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:33,360
some oikos, blueberry animals.

353
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:36,320
You know, dying is a regular part of life.

354
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:38,000
And speaking of regular,

355
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,840
just a little bit of yogurt every day

356
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:41,440
will help keep you that way.

357
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:41,840
I just-

358
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:42,560
Goodbye.

359
00:18:42,560 --> 00:18:44,000
Goodbye, sweet prince.

360
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,400
I just needed a kidney transplant,

361
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:47,360
but I couldn't find-

362
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:48,320
Actually I'm compatible.

363
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:49,200
I'm John Stamos.

364
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:50,080
I can give you a kidney.

365
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:50,880
Just one question though.

366
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:52,240
What's your favorite yogurt?

367
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:53,280
Jibany.

368
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:54,400
Bye motherfucker.

369
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:56,240
Wrong.

370
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:58,640
Say hi to Satan for me.

371
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:01,280
Is John Stamos a universal kidney donor?

372
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:02,640
I'm a universal-

373
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:03,600
My kidneys are perfect.

374
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:04,880
I'm John fucking Stamos.

375
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:05,920
Just one question.

376
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:07,680
What kind of yogurt do you like to party with?

377
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:08,480
Go-gurt.

378
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:09,120
Go-gurt?

379
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:10,320
Yeah, I'm seven.

380
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:10,820
Bye.

381
00:19:12,560 --> 00:19:14,080
You're going to Chobani hell.

382
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:18,240
Saint Peter appeared to you to whisk you away

383
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:19,920
and he was like, have mercy.

384
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:28,000
God, I just-

385
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:30,320
I think I honestly,

386
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:31,680
I would be happy with any celebrity.

387
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:33,520
Beggars can't really be choosers.

388
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:34,240
Wallace Shawn.

389
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:36,320
Wallace Shawn would be really good.

390
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:37,520
Oh my God, guys.

391
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:38,320
Owen Wilson.

392
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:40,160
Why him?

393
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:40,880
So soothing.

394
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:44,800
Yeah, you're gonna die.

395
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:46,080
Hold on, wait, let me try again.

396
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:47,360
Yeah, you're gonna-

397
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:48,640
It's gonna be real cool.

398
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:49,280
You're just gonna die-

399
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:50,560
You sound like Dr. Evil.

400
00:19:50,560 --> 00:19:52,240
Yeah, you're just gonna die and stuff.

401
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:53,620
Yeah.

402
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:57,760
And I don't know, it's gonna be okay

403
00:19:57,760 --> 00:19:58,800
because you know-

404
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:01,840
What is that?

405
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:03,200
What is that?

406
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:05,680
Everybody knows you're about to die,

407
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:08,400
but what my book reaches poses is maybe you didn't.

408
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:09,360
Oh man, what a great-

409
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:11,120
I like that when Griffin does an impression

410
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:14,000
of Owen Wilson,

411
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:17,040
he ages him 40 years for some reason.

412
00:20:17,040 --> 00:20:18,320
You're gonna die, you know?

413
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:21,760
Brothers, I have a birthday coming up

414
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:23,760
and every year I'm plagued by the sheer number

415
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:25,520
of happy birthday wishes I get.

416
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:28,640
They range from close friends and family

417
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:30,240
to basically total randos.

418
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:31,920
I have no idea how to respond.

419
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:33,520
Do I simply like every status?

420
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:35,040
Oh, so like a Facebook thing.

421
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:35,680
Yeah, yeah.

422
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:38,480
Do I respond to everyone with a heartfelt paragraph?

423
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:40,560
Is it rude to only respond to some?

424
00:20:40,560 --> 00:20:42,320
Do I completely ignore all of them?

425
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:43,440
Am I good?

426
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:45,280
That's from No Clue in North Carolina.

427
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:45,920
You know what I like?

428
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:46,720
You know what move I like?

429
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:48,800
Thanks, you too.

430
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:50,080
But Griffin, it's not their birthday.

431
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:52,800
Yeah, that's the fucking bit.

432
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:54,560
But that seems like it would be confusing to them

433
00:20:54,560 --> 00:20:56,000
because they would say like, me too.

434
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,120
What could he mean by that?

435
00:20:57,120 --> 00:21:00,960
I think that you only highlight the best ones.

436
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:01,920
You only think the best ones.

437
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:03,200
And then people understand

438
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:04,960
that like everything in life is a competition.

439
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:06,720
And if they didn't get that thanks,

440
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:08,400
then maybe they should have put

441
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:09,520
a little bit more effort into it.

442
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:11,840
And I think that because I put a lot of fucking effort.

443
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:14,400
I, oh man, I holler for that thank you.

444
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:15,360
You know what I mean?

445
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:17,760
I disagree, Griffin, because I live a life

446
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:19,920
of a social contract that I understand

447
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:21,280
I'm putting the least amount of effort

448
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:23,440
and just putting happy birthday exclamation point.

449
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:26,240
Maybe I capitalize H and B, maybe.

450
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:28,080
And I know that they don't have to respond.

451
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:30,000
But they know that I knew it was their birthday.

452
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,320
And I know that they knew that I knew it was their birthday.

453
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:33,280
And we're done.

454
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:36,400
I get on YouTube and I find,

455
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,800
I search like happy birthday, Douglas,

456
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:44,080
or if it's Douglas's birthday.

457
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:47,600
And I Google, I YouTube search that.

458
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:50,400
And I find videos of like parents singing

459
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:52,320
to their kids happy birthday, Douglas.

460
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:53,360
And put that on their wall.

461
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:55,520
That's especially good for your orphan friends.

462
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:58,000
Yeah, I like to make it special, you know?

463
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,320
See, I sometimes will just have Teresa log in

464
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:02,000
and wish someone a happy birthday for me.

465
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,520
But I don't let her fancy it up.

466
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:05,680
Happy birthday, exclamation point, done.

467
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:08,720
I've actually stopped doing this

468
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:10,720
because I live in constant fear

469
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:12,160
that people are changing their birthdays

470
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:13,520
on Facebook all the time.

471
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:15,040
Just like try and catch you in a trap

472
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:16,320
because I used to do that.

473
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:18,480
And I feel fucking terrible about it now.

474
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:20,480
But that used to be my jam in college.

475
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:22,720
Like when Facebook was still in its infancy

476
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:25,200
and I would change my birthday to like today

477
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:28,320
and just like wait and see like the closest person

478
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:30,560
who would write on my wall wishing me happy birthday.

479
00:22:30,560 --> 00:22:32,720
Just to see like, I guess you don't love me at all, huh?

480
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:35,680
We all have those wild college stories.

481
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:42,720
I do, listen, I do get, I was going to make fun

482
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:44,480
of this question asker a little bit

483
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:46,400
and say like, oh, first world problem.

484
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:48,240
But I actually, I really totally get it.

485
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:50,880
The more I think about it, you try to stay on top of it.

486
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:52,720
And like the first couple hours of the day,

487
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:54,000
you know, you're really good.

488
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,760
Like thanks man, or like, you know,

489
00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:57,280
at least liking everyone.

490
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:59,120
But then like, as you go about your day

491
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:01,600
and get caught up doing stuff, you lose it.

492
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:03,600
And then pretty soon it's like two days later

493
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:04,880
and you're like, do I go back through

494
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:07,040
and say thank you to everyone now?

495
00:23:07,040 --> 00:23:08,640
Or will that just seem hollow?

496
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:08,960
Yeah.

497
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:10,640
Or like, I get it.

498
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:11,520
Let me propose.

499
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:12,960
Just like a general post.

500
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:15,440
Like I'm overwhelmed by all the birthday wishes.

501
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:16,560
Thank you so much.

502
00:23:16,560 --> 00:23:19,280
Wish I could like them all, but I'm like out there.

503
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:20,880
That would take like 45 seconds.

504
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:22,640
I'm like trying to live my life.

505
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:25,440
I'm living my life every damn day to the fullest.

506
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:28,160
Until Wallashawn strokes my hair till I die.

507
00:23:28,160 --> 00:23:29,360
Strokes me to death.

508
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:30,560
Let me hit you all with this.

509
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:35,040
Wallashawn strokes me to death.

510
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:38,080
This is like sort of, I guess, a catch-all for any sort of-

511
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:39,840
Wait, sidebar.

512
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:41,200
Quick Wallashawn sidebar.

513
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:42,240
All right.

514
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:44,080
Sydney just read the book.

515
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:45,040
Yeah, Rachel did too.

516
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:46,720
Princess Bride.

517
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:49,680
She told me the best story about Wallashawn

518
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:52,800
that apparently he had it in his head

519
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:56,720
that what they really wanted was Danny DeVito for the part.

520
00:23:56,720 --> 00:23:59,120
But they couldn't get DeVito, so they got Wallashawn.

521
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,960
Carl Ryder denies this, but Wallashawn was convinced about it.

522
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:07,120
And he said that about half of the time they were filming,

523
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:09,920
he was really distracted because he kept thinking in his head

524
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:12,640
about how Danny DeVito would have done it better

525
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:14,800
and how he could do it more like Danny DeVito.

526
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:16,480
Can you imagine being haunted by the specter?

527
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:17,840
Yeah, that's my every day.

528
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:20,560
It's like, look over your shoulder, it's DeVito.

529
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:22,480
He's always there waiting for you to trip up.

530
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:23,920
Oh, just in the corner of your eye,

531
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:25,760
but if you look directly at him, he disappears.

532
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:26,720
And you're like, what was that?

533
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:28,720
Nothing, nothing, Wallace.

534
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:29,760
Just go on.

535
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:30,800
Let's start at the top.

536
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:32,080
It's Mr. Steel your role.

537
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:35,360
He's right there waiting, waiting to jump into the scene.

538
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:37,520
DeVito, the original Babadook.

539
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:41,520
This is sort of, I guess, a catch-all

540
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:43,840
for any sort of social media quandary.

541
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:49,200
And that is that none of this garbage matters at all.

542
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:53,360
Is that, am I the only one on that page

543
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:54,960
where like nobody gives a fuck?

544
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:58,880
They were forgetting that they were doing it letter by letter.

545
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:02,000
Like by the time they wrote the Y and exclamation point

546
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,560
in Happy Birthday, it was gone, what?

547
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:08,480
And even if it's like, we'll take it to the extreme, right?

548
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:10,560
Say it's your like your triple grandma

549
00:25:10,560 --> 00:25:12,640
and she's like, she grandmas real hard

550
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:15,040
and she spends like three hours

551
00:25:15,040 --> 00:25:17,040
artisanally crafting a Facebook post

552
00:25:17,040 --> 00:25:18,800
and then just sort of like F5s it

553
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:20,240
waiting for that like to pop up.

554
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:25,680
And it doesn't, she will be upset about it

555
00:25:25,680 --> 00:25:27,920
for like 12 minutes.

556
00:25:27,920 --> 00:25:29,680
And then that's that moment.

557
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:33,600
And then that moment is gone.

558
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:34,640
It's in the past.

559
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:37,280
And it's not even like an especially savory moment.

560
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:39,200
Here's the thing.

561
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:42,000
The problem is that it's taken over

562
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,800
what used to be like, oh, it's my best friend's birthday.

563
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:46,480
I'm gonna send them a card.

564
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:48,320
And now it's like, oh, it's my best friend's birthday.

565
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:51,040
I'm going to do the minimal amount of effort

566
00:25:51,040 --> 00:25:52,320
to wish them Happy Birthday.

567
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:53,680
The card thing is also debatable

568
00:25:53,680 --> 00:25:54,560
because then you're extending,

569
00:25:54,560 --> 00:25:57,840
you're prolonging that moment, that magic moment

570
00:25:57,840 --> 00:26:00,960
for, I don't know, like an hour or two.

571
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:03,120
But then nobody's gonna remember that fucking card.

572
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:03,520
You know what I mean?

573
00:26:05,280 --> 00:26:06,240
I get what you're saying.

574
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:09,120
It's just like anything you've ever done

575
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:10,240
all the time you've ever spent

576
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:12,000
like tweeting great shit on Twitter

577
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:15,360
unless you like got a comedy writing gig

578
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:16,800
off of how good your tweets are,

579
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:18,720
which like six people have done.

580
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:20,080
Like none of that shit matters.

581
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:22,480
Or you got three episodes of a sitcom

582
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:26,160
like the Shit My Dad Says guy.

583
00:26:26,160 --> 00:26:28,400
Like none of that, none of it matters.

584
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:28,720
None of it matters.

585
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:30,000
If it is your best friend's birthday,

586
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,160
if it's someone that you would want to like

587
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:34,960
wish you a Happy Birthday, give them a call.

588
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:37,760
It's like 40 seconds, a minute most

589
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:40,960
and just say like, hey, I'm willing to speak to you

590
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:42,320
as one human being to another

591
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:44,400
without written word getting in the way.

592
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:45,280
I love you very much.

593
00:26:45,280 --> 00:26:46,080
Happy Birthday.

594
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:48,720
I'm not like upset that we're fielding questions

595
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:50,800
about social media aptitude.

596
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:51,600
I'm not.

597
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:52,560
I just don't want you,

598
00:26:52,560 --> 00:26:56,080
I don't want anybody to like waste a precious moment

599
00:26:56,080 --> 00:26:59,200
of this, you know, spin around this crazy,

600
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:01,200
this third rock from the sun,

601
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,480
fucking stressing about their favorites.

602
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:05,040
You know what I mean?

603
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:05,680
It's an excellent point

604
00:27:05,680 --> 00:27:08,160
because at this point it's your birthday.

605
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:10,160
The last thing any of these people

606
00:27:10,160 --> 00:27:12,480
who care about you enough to like

607
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:14,640
at least say Happy Birthday to you,

608
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:16,960
they're not doing it to stress you out

609
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:19,040
worrying about who you're going to respond to.

610
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:21,360
Like, and if they are,

611
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:23,600
then you don't need to respond to them in the first place.

612
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:25,920
So like either they love you enough

613
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:27,520
that they don't, that they're doing it

614
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:29,680
because they just wanted to wish you Happy Birthday

615
00:27:29,680 --> 00:27:32,000
or they're doing it so that you will acknowledge

616
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,400
that they're awesome people who wish you Happy Birthday.

617
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:36,400
Either way, you don't have to worry about it.

618
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:38,960
Just power down your Asus,

619
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:40,800
shut it down,

620
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:41,840
close your clients,

621
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:43,840
go out there, eat a nice meal,

622
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:47,760
go just take a dip in a beautiful crystal clear spring.

623
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:49,840
And then quietly die.

624
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:51,840
And quietly die while Wallace Shawn

625
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:53,200
just kisses you on the neck.

626
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:59,040
I just died in Wallace Shawn's arms tonight.

627
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:02,720
I added some syllables back there.

628
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:03,920
Yeah.

629
00:28:03,920 --> 00:28:05,120
Okay, money time.

630
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:05,600
Here we go.

631
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:17,200
Do you guys think 2015 is the year

632
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:19,680
that we fucking just get off Twitter altogether?

633
00:28:19,680 --> 00:28:20,480
Do you think it's the year that we just-

634
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:21,760
The three of us?

635
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:23,280
The three of us can be the captains

636
00:28:23,280 --> 00:28:26,560
of the fucking Exodus space freighter.

637
00:28:26,560 --> 00:28:27,920
I love Twitter.

638
00:28:27,920 --> 00:28:30,640
If fucking 2014 didn't drive me off of Twitter,

639
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:32,560
I don't know what's going to do, honestly.

640
00:28:32,560 --> 00:28:34,160
2014, we were all under assault.

641
00:28:34,160 --> 00:28:35,200
We were all under attack so much.

642
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:37,360
We had enemies at the gates at every gate.

643
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:38,960
There were like 30 gates and there were enemies

644
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:39,520
at all of them.

645
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:41,440
We didn't have time to play in the Exodus.

646
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:42,480
This is the year.

647
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:43,680
Two of every animal.

648
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:45,280
Let's fucking do it, guys.

649
00:28:45,280 --> 00:28:46,800
Come on, get on my freighter.

650
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:48,000
Come on, we're going to LO.

651
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:50,640
They're all going to LO together.

652
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:51,520
We're gonna be safe.

653
00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:52,560
Get in my car, we're going to LO.

654
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:55,840
Have you ever wanted to build an iPhone app?

655
00:28:55,840 --> 00:28:56,720
To replace Twitter?

656
00:28:57,440 --> 00:29:00,720
Do you ever want to make an Instagram or Snapchat

657
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:03,600
like that but better to replace Twitter?

658
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:05,600
Do you want to learn Swift by Apple?

659
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:06,560
We got good news.

660
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:11,600
One month iOS is an easy way to learn iOS development

661
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:12,560
using Swift.

662
00:29:12,560 --> 00:29:15,520
So one month, if you are not already acquainted,

663
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:17,440
is a 30-day program.

664
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:19,760
You give it 30 minutes a day for 30 days.

665
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:25,040
And it is going to teach you a real life skill.

666
00:29:25,040 --> 00:29:28,000
One month HTML is a thing that I've been doing

667
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,720
and I found it really, really helpful.

668
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:34,880
One month Rails to help you make your first web app.

669
00:29:35,680 --> 00:29:38,480
Think how much time you learn on the internet

670
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:40,160
learning shit that doesn't matter

671
00:29:40,160 --> 00:29:41,840
and doesn't help you at all.

672
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:44,000
You're talking about like all the 100% of it?

673
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:44,480
Yeah.

674
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:46,080
Except for the time that you spend on one month?

675
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:47,760
Yes, exactly.

676
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:49,680
Here's something you can waste your time on the internet.

677
00:29:49,680 --> 00:29:50,960
That's not a waste.

678
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:51,760
It's good for you.

679
00:29:53,040 --> 00:29:53,840
It's good for you.

680
00:29:53,840 --> 00:29:55,840
It's just like this is my new 2015 thing.

681
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:58,080
We're all fucking bad at the internet.

682
00:29:58,080 --> 00:30:00,480
We all click on shit that we know is gonna make us angry

683
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:02,240
because dumb people wrote it to make you angry

684
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:03,680
to click on it to get money.

685
00:30:03,680 --> 00:30:04,400
It's fucking...

686
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:05,440
It's time to leave.

687
00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:06,960
We're off.

688
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:08,000
We're done with the internet.

Download this podcast and then cancel your account

690
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:13,360
and then re-open your account in a week

691
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:14,880
to download this podcast again.

692
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:16,160
The only thing you should be doing-

693
00:30:16,160 --> 00:30:17,040
Rinse and repeat.

694
00:30:17,040 --> 00:30:18,640
Unless it's an Adventure Zone week,

695
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:19,440
then grab that.

696
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:19,840
Grab that also.

697
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:24,240
And maybe Bunker Buddies if you're looking for it.

698
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:25,920
What days can you turn off the internet?

699
00:30:25,920 --> 00:30:27,680
What days can you have your internet disconnected?

700
00:30:27,680 --> 00:30:28,320
The weekends.

701
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:28,880
You shouldn't be spending-

702
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:29,360
I think Friday.

703
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:31,360
We spend every Sunday on the internet

704
00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:32,800
recording this goddamn show.

705
00:30:32,800 --> 00:30:35,280
And it's like, it makes me cry inside.

706
00:30:35,280 --> 00:30:35,680
That's the thing.

707
00:30:35,680 --> 00:30:37,440
When Wallace Shawn's stroking my hair in the deathbed,

708
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:39,600
you'd be like, do you have any regrets?

709
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:40,800
That was fucking awesome.

710
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:42,960
That was fucking awesome.

711
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:43,760
That was great.

712
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:45,360
Guys, I've never tried that before.

713
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:49,280
That was a one take Wallace Shawn fucking slam dunk hoop shot.

714
00:30:49,280 --> 00:30:50,800
Wallace Shawn no go.

715
00:30:50,800 --> 00:30:52,240
Do you have any regrets?

716
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:52,880
And I'll be like-

717
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:54,640
You should edit, edit in,

718
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:56,160
edit out all the ones you did before that.

719
00:30:56,160 --> 00:30:56,560
And then-

720
00:30:56,560 --> 00:30:57,600
No, don't say that.

721
00:30:58,400 --> 00:30:59,200
Don't say that.

722
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:00,320
That was my first try at it.

723
00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:01,120
Edit that in.

724
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:02,480
God damn it, Justin.

725
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:04,640
I'll let you saying that out.

726
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:05,600
Now who's the victor?

727
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:08,960
I am the king of content.

728
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:11,600
Ah, but Griffin, if you edit out him saying that,

729
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:13,360
it will be a paradox.

730
00:31:13,360 --> 00:31:13,760
Okay.

731
00:31:13,760 --> 00:31:16,400
This is going to be a 45 second long episode of

732
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:17,680
Wallace Shawn strokes my hair.

733
00:31:17,680 --> 00:31:19,200
What are you, you got any regrets?

734
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:20,000
That's not as good.

735
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:20,960
Oh, you tried to begin.

736
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:21,680
Shut up.

737
00:31:21,680 --> 00:31:22,240
And I'll say-

738
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:22,880
I'm greedy.

739
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:23,380
Yeah.

740
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:27,280
A lot of wasted Sunday hours I could have spent in church.

741
00:31:27,280 --> 00:31:28,480
Anyway, what are we talking about?

742
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:29,040
One month.

743
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:31,920
One month.com slash my brother.

744
00:31:31,920 --> 00:31:36,720
You're going to be able to save 25% off of your first class.

745
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:38,000
That's a one time discount.

746
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:41,360
25% and you can get a real life skill.

747
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:44,160
It's broken down into 30 minutes a day for one month

748
00:31:44,160 --> 00:31:46,720
and you can get a something really useful

749
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:48,480
and make some good use of your internet time.

750
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:51,680
One month.com slash my brother.

751
00:31:51,680 --> 00:31:53,520
When you're spending your time not on the internet,

752
00:31:53,520 --> 00:31:54,640
just sort of wasting away,

753
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:57,920
you're going to go on some adventures out there.

754
00:31:57,920 --> 00:32:00,080
2015, year of cons, year of adventures.

755
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:02,800
And while you're on adventures,

756
00:32:02,800 --> 00:32:06,160
you're going to need some snacks in your gunny sack,

757
00:32:06,160 --> 00:32:07,600
in your adventure bag.

758
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:08,960
And what can you stuff in there?

759
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:11,760
Why, I have a suggestion, some nature box.

760
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:14,720
While you're out in nature, just like smelling a tree,

761
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:16,240
smelling some bark,

762
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:18,640
I want you to reach in your bag and you're going to pull out

763
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:21,440
over a hundred nutritionist approved snacks.

764
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:22,960
Nature box has something for everyone.

765
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:26,240
It's got no artificial flavors, no colors, no sweeteners.

766
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:27,760
No, it got zero grams.

767
00:32:27,760 --> 00:32:28,880
Hold on.

768
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:30,240
It does have colors.

769
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:31,680
It doesn't have artificial colors.

770
00:32:31,680 --> 00:32:34,160
No, it can't be perceived by the dumb cones

771
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:35,600
in your human eyes.

772
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:38,080
Only locusts can see nature box snacks.

773
00:32:39,520 --> 00:32:41,680
They don't have GMOs, but they are invisible.

774
00:32:41,680 --> 00:32:42,640
It's fucked up.

775
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:44,480
Anyway, they don't got trans fats.

776
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:45,840
They don't got high fructose corn syrup.

777
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:46,800
They don't got tweets.

778
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:51,040
Anyway, you can get all kinds of great stuff.

779
00:32:51,040 --> 00:32:52,880
They got sriracha roasted cashews.

780
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:54,880
They got pistachio power clusters.

781
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:56,400
Those are going to make you more powerful.

782
00:32:57,200 --> 00:32:58,640
They got big island pineapple.

783
00:32:58,640 --> 00:33:01,600
That's going to help you appreciate the beaches

784
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:03,120
that you're exploring, that you're backpacking

785
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:04,240
through Sicily.

786
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:05,360
It's going to be great.

787
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:07,440
You have the chance to try nature box for free

788
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:09,680
with a trial box of five of their most popular snacks.

789
00:33:09,680 --> 00:33:10,400
Free snacks.

790
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:12,400
Five of them, five bags of free snacks.

791
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:13,600
You're going to get them for free

792
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:15,280
because they're free snacks.

793
00:33:15,280 --> 00:33:18,400
What do we have to do to get you into some free snacks today?

794
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:20,480
We're going to shrink your body down

795
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:22,080
and we're going to put you in a bag of nature box

796
00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:25,120
and you're just going to have like a cocoa yum-yums

797
00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:26,320
ball pit experience.

798
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:27,440
But what's that over there?

799
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:29,680
It's a guy in a tiny exoskeleton.

800
00:33:29,680 --> 00:33:31,360
He's going to fight with you, but that's okay

801
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:33,360
because you're going to break through the glass on his mask

802
00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:36,240
and then I think Martin Shorts stomach acid

803
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:37,280
is going to eat away at him.

804
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:38,880
I thought you said his name was Martin Shorts.

805
00:33:40,800 --> 00:33:42,640
Martin Shorts, the comedian.

806
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:44,320
Can we all agree that Martin Shorts would be

807
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:46,880
the worst deathbed buddy?

808
00:33:48,560 --> 00:33:50,000
He would not take it seriously.

809
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,000
He would make it all about him.

810
00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:54,960
This is my death.

811
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:57,280
Can you not be like goofing right now?

812
00:33:58,320 --> 00:33:59,120
Oh yeah.

813
00:33:59,120 --> 00:33:59,600
Oh yeah.

814
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:04,480
It's your impression of the Hollywood guy.

815
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:05,360
Fuck, what's his name?

816
00:34:05,920 --> 00:34:06,960
Jiminy Glick?

817
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:07,440
Yeah.

818
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:08,880
And I don't think it's an impression of him.

819
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:10,160
I think he just like made him.

820
00:34:10,160 --> 00:34:13,280
Yeah, I don't think he's basing that on a real Jiminy Glick.

821
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:14,640
Jiminy Glick, great.

822
00:34:14,640 --> 00:34:16,400
I wanted that to be my last.

823
00:34:16,400 --> 00:34:17,120
You know what, Travis?

824
00:34:17,120 --> 00:34:19,440
You say that, but we all know a Jiminy Glick, don't we?

825
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:20,320
Look at yourself.

826
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:21,200
Are you the Jiminy?

827
00:34:21,200 --> 00:34:23,840
If you look around the table and you don't see the Jiminy Glick,

828
00:34:23,840 --> 00:34:25,200
you are the Jiminy Glick.

829
00:34:25,200 --> 00:34:26,800
Go to naturebox.com slash my brother.

830
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:28,960
We're going to get you those free snacks.

831
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:29,760
You're going to eat them.

832
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:31,440
You're going to be a happier, better person.

833
00:34:32,400 --> 00:34:35,280
Chelsea Care, I got a message for you from Adam Ford.

834
00:34:36,160 --> 00:34:40,320
And he says, what better time a year than candle lights

835
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:44,240
to take revenge upon your GIF for a birthday Jumbotron message.

836
00:34:45,120 --> 00:34:47,840
I can suggest maybe a better time would be January 25th.

837
00:34:47,840 --> 00:34:51,840
And maybe January 25th is literally one calendar month after.

838
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:56,320
That's what makes it a surprise.

839
00:34:56,320 --> 00:34:57,440
There's no Vengeance Day yet.

840
00:34:57,440 --> 00:34:59,520
So here's some dirt on Chelsea.

841
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:00,240
Oh, shit.

842
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:01,600
She's her godmother.

843
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:03,520
No, no, Katie Lang.

844
00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:07,360
For my money, Katie Lang doing hallelujah is the best version of it.

845
00:35:07,360 --> 00:35:08,720
Sorry to Rebus Wainwright.

846
00:35:08,720 --> 00:35:10,960
Sorry to Jeff.

847
00:35:11,840 --> 00:35:14,880
Sorry to Shrek for Shrek's version of hallelujah.

848
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:19,440
It's Shrek sings in Shrek.

849
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:21,200
Chelsea is extremely good looking.

850
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:22,480
Whoa, Justin.

851
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:24,400
Loves border collies more than horses.

852
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:26,880
Happy candle lights, Chelsea.

853
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:29,040
I'm sorry that that was a month ago.

854
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:30,320
It doesn't say that, but I'm saying.

855
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:32,320
No, what it says is you're a butt.

856
00:35:33,520 --> 00:35:34,080
Oh, man.

857
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:35,760
Got her, Adam.

858
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:37,440
That was a zinger.

859
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:40,880
Way to really nail her to the wall there, Adam.

860
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:41,760
You really showed her.

861
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:46,720
Do you think it's embarrassing that Katie Lang is her godmother?

862
00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:47,840
Because I think that's awesome.

863
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:48,960
Well, he just says it's dirt.

864
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:54,560
So it's like, if we need to, you know, get a private investigation going,

865
00:35:54,560 --> 00:35:55,600
there are the facts.

866
00:35:55,600 --> 00:35:59,680
We just needed a little leverage against Katie Lang.

867
00:36:01,120 --> 00:36:04,480
Finally, we can put our plan in place.

868
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:08,640
So happy birthday, Chelsea.

869
00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:09,840
Nope, not birthday.

870
00:36:09,840 --> 00:36:13,360
Okay, you just saw the word birthday in there, and you just sort of let it roll.

871
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:14,560
You know what?

872
00:36:14,560 --> 00:36:16,960
It's been so long, it may be her birthday bar now.

873
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:18,400
It's impossible to know.

874
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:19,280
Happy Arbor Day.

875
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:21,360
Who knows when this fucking thing's going up?

876
00:36:21,360 --> 00:36:23,040
Happy Vengeance Day, Chelsea.

877
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:25,840
People don't know we record these episodes months in advance.

878
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:30,880
I got a message for Dave, and the message is from Casey and Matt.

879
00:36:31,600 --> 00:36:32,960
Casey and Matt.

880
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:34,480
Oh, guys, I'm sorry.

881
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:35,040
And JoJo.

882
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:36,480
Come on.

883
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:40,560
You think Casey has never gotten that before?

884
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:43,120
I really wanted to sing that song, but then I couldn't remember it.

885
00:36:43,120 --> 00:36:44,880
Oh, do you mean, tell me it's real.

886
00:36:45,680 --> 00:36:48,320
This feeling all my life.

887
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:48,880
There it is.

888
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:50,000
See, a lot of people go for that.

889
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:53,600
Tell Me It's Real is obviously the superior Casey and JoJo song.

890
00:36:54,720 --> 00:36:57,680
Listen, we could spend the rest of the episode talking about the Casey.

891
00:36:57,680 --> 00:37:01,360
We all have strong opinions about the Casey and JoJo oeuvre.

892
00:37:01,360 --> 00:37:06,960
Let me crack open the Casey and JoJo omnibus, and I will go through their b-sides.

893
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:09,040
The Casey and JoJo nomicon?

894
00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:09,840
Can I just?

895
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:14,720
Dave, Merry Christmas and congrats on your pro ability to manufacture a child.

896
00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:18,160
You're always hard to shop for, so we thought the best gift would be to pay the McElroy family

897
00:37:18,160 --> 00:37:21,680
to confess that your gigantic new baby is way better than theirs.

898
00:37:21,680 --> 00:37:22,080
What?

899
00:37:22,080 --> 00:37:23,040
Oh, no.

900
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:24,160
Oh, no, son.

901
00:37:24,160 --> 00:37:25,120
Incorrect.

902
00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:25,760
Wrong O.

903
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:27,040
You can't force me to say that.

904
00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:28,960
Baby Charlie is bringing it hot.

905
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:31,120
Now, when they say better than theirs,

906
00:37:31,120 --> 00:37:38,800
does that intimate that Charlie is all of ours in a weird three brothers and a baby situation?

907
00:37:39,360 --> 00:37:40,560
Yeah, maybe.

908
00:37:40,560 --> 00:37:43,200
I'm pretty sure Justin has the main claim.

909
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:44,480
Soul claim, yeah.

910
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:45,360
Another question.

911
00:37:45,360 --> 00:37:47,680
Did Dave make a baby from spare parts?

912
00:37:49,040 --> 00:37:51,120
Dave, congratulations on Small Wondering.

913
00:37:51,680 --> 00:37:54,160
Everyone said you couldn't do it, and then you did do it.

914
00:37:57,280 --> 00:37:58,880
Small Wonder was the name of the show, right?

915
00:37:58,880 --> 00:38:01,200
Yeah, Small One, yeah.

916
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:01,920
Yeah, right.

917
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:03,360
Well, in America, that's what it was.

918
00:38:07,600 --> 00:38:15,760
In Europe, and I believe most of West Asia, it was called Blossom.

919
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:16,800
Metric Wonder.

920
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:17,040
Okay.

921
00:38:18,240 --> 00:38:22,880
In Japan, it was called My Daughter, the Secret, which is odd.

922
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:24,640
It's an odd bit of translation.

923
00:38:24,640 --> 00:38:26,320
Happy birthday, Dave.

924
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:28,000
Well, you didn't even finish reading the message.

925
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:32,800
Okay, maybe we could set our babies up a la Swan Princess style.

926
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:34,160
JK, unless you guys are into that.

927
00:38:34,160 --> 00:38:34,960
Merry Christmas.

928
00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:35,440
Love you.

929
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:36,320
Okay, guys.

930
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:37,440
Listen, here's a serious...

931
00:38:38,160 --> 00:38:41,440
We gotta stop mentioning the date that you think this will happen,

932
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:42,640
because it will not happen then.

933
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:45,040
You have to stop putting holidays in these places.

934
00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:46,160
It's nice, though, in like...

935
00:38:47,360 --> 00:38:47,680
I don't know.

936
00:38:47,680 --> 00:38:52,000
It's a nice little rainbow connection that both of these people fucked up at the same time.

937
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:58,240
Like maybe somewhere underneath that big bright moon, somebody else is fucking up,

938
00:38:58,240 --> 00:39:00,960
in addition to me, vis-a-vis timing.

939
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:02,000
Happy birthday, Dave.

940
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:05,680
Happy, I don't know, Super Bowl Sunday to Chelsea.

941
00:39:07,360 --> 00:39:10,800
We love all of you, but we have important pressing business.

942
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:11,680
Do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do.

943
00:39:11,680 --> 00:39:12,320
Oh, no.

944
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:15,040
It's Haunted Doll Watch.

945
00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:18,640
Live from my brother, my brother, and me, Haunted Doll Watch, our new hit feature

946
00:39:18,640 --> 00:39:20,740
feature that everybody is crazy about,

947
00:39:20,740 --> 00:39:23,160
where I look for the latest and greatest

948
00:39:23,160 --> 00:39:26,960
in haunted dolls on the eBay service.

949
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:29,480
Today we've got a really hot one coming in,

950
00:39:29,480 --> 00:39:34,360
and I mean that literally haunted, spirited, paranormal,

951
00:39:34,360 --> 00:39:38,160
scary, burn doll spirit Alicia Creepy.

952
00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:39,520
That is the listing.

953
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:41,240
Let me go ahead and link my brothers there

954
00:39:41,240 --> 00:39:43,200
so you can find it if you're playing along at home.

955
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:46,000
You can certainly just Google that on eBay.

956
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,960
Jesus Christ. Oh my God.

957
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:52,080
So this is a horrifically burned, naked baby doll,

958
00:39:52,080 --> 00:39:54,720
which I mention only because the story

959
00:39:54,720 --> 00:39:58,040
that I'm about to tell is going to seem bat shit.

960
00:39:58,040 --> 00:39:58,880
Here we go.

961
00:39:58,880 --> 00:40:03,040
Burned doll Alicia found at the remains of a house fire

962
00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:06,340
in 1997 in New York on Christmas Eve.

963
00:40:06,340 --> 00:40:08,600
The items were put out on the curb,

964
00:40:08,600 --> 00:40:10,240
and she was rescued by a native.

965
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:11,160
Oh, I got it.

966
00:40:11,160 --> 00:40:12,320
Oh, I got the doll.

967
00:40:12,320 --> 00:40:13,640
Oh, that was cool.

968
00:40:13,640 --> 00:40:14,480
I saved her.

969
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:16,840
I hope this shit's not haunted.

970
00:40:16,840 --> 00:40:19,120
The gentleman who brought her to me

971
00:40:19,120 --> 00:40:22,680
said his wife who rescued her, okay, which, okay, got it.

972
00:40:22,680 --> 00:40:24,240
I'm getting some mixed details here.

973
00:40:24,240 --> 00:40:25,480
Yeah, mixed details here.

974
00:40:25,480 --> 00:40:27,360
Kept her in her craft room.

975
00:40:27,360 --> 00:40:28,840
Burn the craft room.

976
00:40:28,840 --> 00:40:33,360
Listen, kept her in her craft room and would talk to her

977
00:40:33,360 --> 00:40:35,780
as if she could understand her every word.

978
00:40:35,780 --> 00:40:37,920
She was happiest when she was with the doll.

979
00:40:37,920 --> 00:40:40,560
I mean. Look at that fucking doll

980
00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:43,800
and tell me that that is not 100% cockamamie bullshit.

981
00:40:43,800 --> 00:40:45,400
No, I feel like you get me.

982
00:40:45,400 --> 00:40:47,680
You make me feel so understood,

983
00:40:47,680 --> 00:40:50,400
creepy, creepy, creepy burned ass doll

984
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:52,400
with it looks like muscular tissue

985
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:53,240
underneath your burned eyes.

986
00:40:53,240 --> 00:40:55,080
I'm just here to help you.

987
00:40:55,080 --> 00:40:56,440
I'm Harvey Fierstein.

988
00:40:56,440 --> 00:40:59,840
I've inhabited this burned, burned ass doll.

989
00:40:59,840 --> 00:41:03,640
No, the doll was apparently inhabited

990
00:41:03,640 --> 00:41:05,620
by a girl who was in the fire.

991
00:41:05,620 --> 00:41:06,460
Oh, great.

992
00:41:06,460 --> 00:41:07,560
Here is the next sentence.

993
00:41:07,560 --> 00:41:10,160
He never said anything about the doll

994
00:41:10,160 --> 00:41:12,120
because his wife knew the girl

995
00:41:12,120 --> 00:41:14,520
and was despondent about the fire.

996
00:41:15,400 --> 00:41:20,120
Okay, so he brings his wife home a burned doll.

997
00:41:20,120 --> 00:41:22,160
Hey honey. From a trash pile.

998
00:41:22,160 --> 00:41:25,440
I got you this garbage ass burned ass doll.

999
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:27,080
Maybe haunted.

1000
00:41:27,080 --> 00:41:28,220
Do you want to talk to it?

1001
00:41:28,220 --> 00:41:30,120
Maybe put it in your craft room.

1002
00:41:30,120 --> 00:41:32,000
You were just saying how you wanted more,

1003
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:35,060
you wanted more ruined shitty garbage.

1004
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:37,680
His wife recently passed.

1005
00:41:37,680 --> 00:41:41,080
So Alicia needs a new home.

1006
00:41:41,080 --> 00:41:44,200
Her unique traits are a cold chill

1007
00:41:44,200 --> 00:41:46,040
in the area surrounding her.

1008
00:41:46,040 --> 00:41:48,400
There may be more if you're accepted by her.

1009
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:52,560
I'm selling her for Mr. Beck, the owner of the doll.

1010
00:41:52,560 --> 00:41:55,320
Wait, I want to break down that last thing.

1011
00:41:55,320 --> 00:41:57,600
If you're accepted by her, like if she's like,

1012
00:41:57,600 --> 00:41:58,880
yeah, you're cool, we can hang.

1013
00:41:58,880 --> 00:41:59,720
You're cool.

1014
00:41:59,720 --> 00:42:02,840
Now let me just sort of demonstrate some more

1015
00:42:02,840 --> 00:42:04,400
of my ghost powers.

1016
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:05,680
Did you want that table to float?

1017
00:42:05,680 --> 00:42:07,080
Cause now it's floating.

1018
00:42:07,080 --> 00:42:08,040
Are you chilling?

1019
00:42:08,040 --> 00:42:11,960
There are six pictures of this doll on the eBay.

1020
00:42:11,960 --> 00:42:14,000
Sorry, eight pictures of the doll.

1021
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:15,720
In case you didn't get it from the first one,

1022
00:42:15,720 --> 00:42:17,280
where it's a horrifically burned mess.

1023
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:19,880
And if you look closely at the pictures of the doll,

1024
00:42:19,880 --> 00:42:23,720
you'll notice that she's sitting in a tiny lawn chair.

1025
00:42:23,720 --> 00:42:25,160
Really festive.

1026
00:42:25,160 --> 00:42:26,000
Well, that's it.

1027
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:27,160
She wasn't burning a fire.

1028
00:42:27,160 --> 00:42:28,440
She got too much sun.

1029
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:31,840
There are two bids already on this.

1030
00:42:31,840 --> 00:42:33,880
You want to get in there soon.

1031
00:42:33,880 --> 00:42:35,760
Current bid is $29.

1032
00:42:35,760 --> 00:42:39,360
So make sure you pick up Alicia creepy spirit,

1033
00:42:39,360 --> 00:42:40,760
burn all scary paranormal.

1034
00:42:40,760 --> 00:42:44,160
It is upsetting to me that the current bid is $29

1035
00:42:44,160 --> 00:42:45,920
and the shipping is 23.

1036
00:42:45,920 --> 00:42:48,600
It's upsetting to me that there is more than one bid.

1037
00:42:48,600 --> 00:42:50,600
There's a bidding war for haunted spirit,

1038
00:42:50,600 --> 00:42:53,200
paranormal, scary burn, doll spirit, Alicia creepy.

1039
00:42:53,200 --> 00:42:56,840
Everybody fucking hop in to my vessel.

1040
00:42:58,080 --> 00:42:59,080
Away we go.

1041
00:42:59,080 --> 00:42:59,920
Bye internet.

1042
00:42:59,920 --> 00:43:01,440
Bye internet forever.

1043
00:43:03,320 --> 00:43:04,160
Hi everybody.

1044
00:43:04,160 --> 00:43:05,360
I'm Justin McElroy.

1045
00:43:05,360 --> 00:43:06,920
And I'm Dr. Sydney McElroy.

1046
00:43:06,920 --> 00:43:09,520
Every Tuesday we bring you saw bones,

1047
00:43:09,520 --> 00:43:12,400
a marital tour of misguided medicine,

1048
00:43:12,400 --> 00:43:15,760
a show about all the dumb, weird, terrible ways

1049
00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:17,720
that we've tried to fix each other over the years.

1050
00:43:17,720 --> 00:43:19,880
You know, some light summer listening.

1051
00:43:19,880 --> 00:43:21,880
Maybe you want to hear about yogurt enemas

1052
00:43:21,880 --> 00:43:24,520
or why we tried to eat mummies for a while

1053
00:43:24,520 --> 00:43:28,040
or why drinking cholera diarrhea sounded like a good idea.

1054
00:43:28,040 --> 00:43:31,280
That and so much more is waiting for you every Tuesday

1055
00:43:31,280 --> 00:43:34,200
right here on the maximum fun network

1056
00:43:34,200 --> 00:43:38,240
with saw bones, a marital tour of misguided medicine.

1057
00:43:40,720 --> 00:43:42,360
Y'all want a yahoo?

1058
00:43:42,360 --> 00:43:43,400
Yes.

1059
00:43:43,400 --> 00:43:48,000
This yahoo was sent in by Eric Lawrenson.

1060
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:48,840
Thank you Eric.

1061
00:43:48,840 --> 00:43:51,600
It's by yahoo answers user Christina who asks,

1062
00:43:51,600 --> 00:43:54,400
I've always wondered this.

1063
00:43:54,400 --> 00:43:55,960
That's in all caps.

1064
00:43:55,960 --> 00:43:58,360
When you send out a text message

1065
00:43:58,360 --> 00:44:02,840
and before the other person receives the message,

1066
00:44:02,840 --> 00:44:05,080
where does it go?

1067
00:44:05,080 --> 00:44:07,200
It has always been picking at my brain.

1068
00:44:10,520 --> 00:44:12,320
It goes to space, right?

1069
00:44:12,320 --> 00:44:13,160
Goes to space.

1070
00:44:13,160 --> 00:44:15,240
It goes to the stash.

1071
00:44:15,240 --> 00:44:17,840
That's my Sean Connery in dragon heart.

1072
00:44:18,680 --> 00:44:19,800
Okay.

1073
00:44:19,800 --> 00:44:21,960
And we'll start in the stars boys

1074
00:44:21,960 --> 00:44:23,880
while your text messages go.

1075
00:44:23,880 --> 00:44:25,240
Lots of really great impressions.

1076
00:44:25,240 --> 00:44:27,800
A lot of really a material.

1077
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:30,480
I mean, first it goes across.

1078
00:44:30,480 --> 00:44:33,600
I feel like a ticker on president Obama's desk.

1079
00:44:33,600 --> 00:44:34,480
He clears it.

1080
00:44:34,480 --> 00:44:37,080
He clears it for, I mean, he checks it.

1081
00:44:37,080 --> 00:44:38,160
He miss spells words

1082
00:44:38,160 --> 00:44:39,840
that you had actually spelled correctly.

1083
00:44:39,840 --> 00:44:41,400
Cause he's a little scamp.

1084
00:44:42,520 --> 00:44:43,520
Most people don't know this.

1085
00:44:43,520 --> 00:44:44,960
Obama is spell check.

1086
00:44:44,960 --> 00:44:46,040
He is the spell check.

1087
00:44:46,040 --> 00:44:47,000
He is clippy.

1088
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:50,400
He takes your sex and he makes them sexier.

1089
00:44:52,840 --> 00:44:53,680
He adds a lot.

1090
00:44:53,680 --> 00:44:55,360
I'm surprised he didn't address that and say union.

1091
00:44:55,360 --> 00:44:59,320
Like if you're wondering why I did not get more done

1092
00:44:59,320 --> 00:45:01,880
in my tenure in office,

1093
00:45:01,880 --> 00:45:04,880
cause I had to read all of your text messages.

1094
00:45:04,880 --> 00:45:07,520
I had to juice up your sexts.

1095
00:45:07,520 --> 00:45:10,200
A lot of really good impressions.

1096
00:45:10,200 --> 00:45:12,560
You know when all of you moms out there

1097
00:45:12,560 --> 00:45:17,520
send one single thought in like seven text messages,

1098
00:45:17,520 --> 00:45:20,480
just word after word after word.

1099
00:45:20,480 --> 00:45:21,720
I had to read all those.

1100
00:45:23,480 --> 00:45:24,960
President Obama.

1101
00:45:24,960 --> 00:45:27,480
I always imagine that text messages and phone calls

1102
00:45:27,480 --> 00:45:29,960
are a lot like that scene in Willy Wonka.

1103
00:45:29,960 --> 00:45:30,800
Thank you.

1104
00:45:30,800 --> 00:45:31,880
I was literally just about to say that.

1105
00:45:31,880 --> 00:45:34,640
That is my entire understanding of broadcast information,

1106
00:45:34,640 --> 00:45:37,080
wireless internet, everything is that.

1107
00:45:37,080 --> 00:45:39,760
It goes up in the sky and just kind of sits there.

1108
00:45:39,760 --> 00:45:43,760
Turns into a little boy until you download it.

1109
00:45:43,760 --> 00:45:46,120
You send a text, it turns into a boy.

1110
00:45:46,120 --> 00:45:48,720
It disintegrates that boy.

1111
00:45:48,720 --> 00:45:50,240
It sends him flying.

1112
00:45:50,240 --> 00:45:53,040
The little boy appears on your friend's cell phone

1113
00:45:53,040 --> 00:45:54,720
and then it's like, what up?

1114
00:45:54,720 --> 00:45:56,440
Cause that's what you texted.

1115
00:45:56,440 --> 00:45:58,520
And then they stretch him.

1116
00:45:58,520 --> 00:45:59,640
Hey, you up?

1117
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:01,840
Hey, you up? Please let me

1118
00:46:01,840 --> 00:46:02,680
out of your phone.

1119
00:46:02,680 --> 00:46:03,520
It's me, Mike TV.

1120
00:46:03,520 --> 00:46:04,360
Hey, you up?

1121
00:46:10,520 --> 00:46:12,200
Hey, did you watch Arrow last night?

1122
00:46:12,200 --> 00:46:13,040
From dad.

1123
00:46:15,800 --> 00:46:18,320
Every time you text message, you kill a boy for a little bit

1124
00:46:18,320 --> 00:46:21,000
but then he comes back to life, but little and data.

1125
00:46:22,240 --> 00:46:24,880
That's why fucking AT&T and Verizon and all them shits,

1126
00:46:24,880 --> 00:46:27,120
they gotta put caps on stuff.

1127
00:46:27,120 --> 00:46:27,960
Stop killing.

1128
00:46:27,960 --> 00:46:30,280
You went over your killing little boy limit this month

1129
00:46:30,280 --> 00:46:31,800
and that was gonna be an extra $10.

1130
00:46:31,800 --> 00:46:33,840
Killing's not the right word.

1131
00:46:33,840 --> 00:46:37,640
You temporarily killing via dissolution.

1132
00:46:37,640 --> 00:46:38,880
You dis-exist him.

1133
00:46:38,880 --> 00:46:39,720
Yeah.

1134
00:46:39,720 --> 00:46:40,560
That's a word.

1135
00:46:40,560 --> 00:46:42,080
But then you re-exist him to be like.

1136
00:46:44,120 --> 00:46:46,440
Is that why my phone memory is always so full?

1137
00:46:46,440 --> 00:46:48,160
Cause it's just full of little boys.

1138
00:46:48,160 --> 00:46:49,480
Uh-huh.

1139
00:46:49,480 --> 00:46:51,480
Ah, I needed to delete some of those.

1140
00:46:51,480 --> 00:46:52,480
You really do.

1141
00:46:52,480 --> 00:46:56,360
Um, what, does anybody actually know?

1142
00:46:56,360 --> 00:47:01,360
I feel like whenever like Jeff AT&T invented text messages,

1143
00:47:01,440 --> 00:47:06,120
whenever Steven, Michael Stevens, SMS invented text messages

1144
00:47:07,040 --> 00:47:08,760
and he like sent the first one

1145
00:47:08,760 --> 00:47:10,200
and it showed up on somebody else's phone,

1146
00:47:10,200 --> 00:47:12,640
he was probably like, whoa.

1147
00:47:12,640 --> 00:47:14,520
And it said, what have God wrong?

1148
00:47:14,520 --> 00:47:15,360
How did that happen?

1149
00:47:15,360 --> 00:47:16,200
With the smiley face.

1150
00:47:16,200 --> 00:47:17,520
How did that even happen?

1151
00:47:17,520 --> 00:47:18,760
It must be Ghost Rider.

1152
00:47:18,760 --> 00:47:21,040
And then for years, everybody thought it was Ghost Rider

1153
00:47:21,040 --> 00:47:24,960
when the truth is that they got it, is Ghost Rider.

1154
00:47:24,960 --> 00:47:27,480
You know when people like hold their phones up to windows

1155
00:47:27,480 --> 00:47:29,840
or something to try to get like better service

1156
00:47:29,840 --> 00:47:31,120
and everybody's like, what are you doing?

1157
00:47:31,120 --> 00:47:31,960
That doesn't work.

1158
00:47:31,960 --> 00:47:32,800
You don't know that.

1159
00:47:32,800 --> 00:47:33,640
You don't know.

1160
00:47:33,640 --> 00:47:34,460
You're showing. You don't know shit about phones.

1161
00:47:34,460 --> 00:47:35,640
You're holding your phone up to the window

1162
00:47:35,640 --> 00:47:37,160
and Ghost Rider's like floating around like,

1163
00:47:37,160 --> 00:47:42,160
let's see, is this supposed to go to 2323 apartment B?

1164
00:47:42,760 --> 00:47:44,680
Where is the interest?

1165
00:47:44,680 --> 00:47:45,520
Oh, nevermind.

1166
00:47:45,520 --> 00:47:46,340
There it is.

1167
00:47:46,340 --> 00:47:47,180
Zoop.

1168
00:47:47,180 --> 00:47:48,020
What up?

1169
00:47:48,020 --> 00:47:48,840
I got a question here.

1170
00:47:48,840 --> 00:47:49,680
Hi brothers.

1171
00:47:49,680 --> 00:47:50,520
I don't know what to do about.

1172
00:47:50,520 --> 00:47:51,360
I'm guessing.

1173
00:47:51,360 --> 00:47:52,280
So I got to answer it now.

1174
00:47:52,280 --> 00:47:53,120
Hi brothers.

1175
00:47:53,120 --> 00:47:54,100
I don't know what to do about invitations

1176
00:47:54,100 --> 00:47:55,880
to my Super Bowl party.

1177
00:47:55,880 --> 00:47:58,120
Our friend group has a couple in it

1178
00:47:58,120 --> 00:48:00,240
who recently split up due to one member

1179
00:48:00,240 --> 00:48:02,240
of the couple finding someone new.

1180
00:48:02,240 --> 00:48:04,840
I already stupidly told both members

1181
00:48:04,840 --> 00:48:07,200
about the Super Bowl get together.

1182
00:48:07,200 --> 00:48:09,780
One person says she will not attend

1183
00:48:09,780 --> 00:48:11,980
if her ex's new significant other is there.

1184
00:48:11,980 --> 00:48:13,320
Problem solved.

1185
00:48:13,320 --> 00:48:14,800
Yeah, I haven't yet sent an email.

1186
00:48:14,800 --> 00:48:17,520
How do I delicately make sure that everyone who is there

1187
00:48:17,520 --> 00:48:19,600
will not explode in a horrible rage fight?

1188
00:48:19,600 --> 00:48:22,360
That's from super befuddled for the Super Bowl.

1189
00:48:22,360 --> 00:48:23,480
Let's make this quick.

1190
00:48:23,480 --> 00:48:24,540
Like the actual practical.

1191
00:48:24,540 --> 00:48:27,080
We can goo for, you know, talk about how

1192
00:48:27,080 --> 00:48:29,600
we'll make them like fight or like play a football game

1193
00:48:29,600 --> 00:48:31,040
outside in the winter camp.

1194
00:48:31,040 --> 00:48:32,040
We'll do that dumb shit later,

1195
00:48:32,040 --> 00:48:33,980
but I feel like we've addressed this before

1196
00:48:33,980 --> 00:48:36,280
where that's not your goddamn problem.

1197
00:48:36,280 --> 00:48:37,120
Nope.

1198
00:48:37,120 --> 00:48:37,940
Super isn't your problem.

1199
00:48:37,940 --> 00:48:38,780
Invite them both.

1200
00:48:38,780 --> 00:48:39,600
They can show up if they want.

1201
00:48:39,600 --> 00:48:41,440
They can be fucking adults if they want.

1202
00:48:41,440 --> 00:48:43,960
The only beef you have to worry about is in the cheese dip.

1203
00:48:43,960 --> 00:48:44,900
Yep.

1204
00:48:44,900 --> 00:48:46,080
Don't put beef in your cheese dip.

1205
00:48:46,080 --> 00:48:47,160
That seems awfully excessive.

1206
00:48:47,160 --> 00:48:48,200
Oh no, it sounds really good.

1207
00:48:48,200 --> 00:48:50,240
Like if you did like sausage in there, ooh.

1208
00:48:50,240 --> 00:48:51,280
Speaking of beef,

1209
00:48:51,280 --> 00:48:52,440
remind me to circle back around

1210
00:48:52,440 --> 00:48:53,880
after this question about beef nugs.

1211
00:48:53,880 --> 00:48:54,960
Remind me to circle back around

1212
00:48:54,960 --> 00:48:56,480
and yell at everybody who listens to our show

1213
00:48:56,480 --> 00:48:57,320
about fucking beef nugs.

1214
00:48:57,320 --> 00:48:58,140
Hey, you know what?

1215
00:48:58,140 --> 00:48:58,980
We answered the question.

1216
00:48:58,980 --> 00:48:59,800
Question answered.

1217
00:48:59,800 --> 00:49:00,640
Okay, question answered.

1218
00:49:00,640 --> 00:49:01,480
Just invited.

1219
00:49:01,480 --> 00:49:02,300
Okay, beef nugs.

1220
00:49:02,300 --> 00:49:03,140
Beef nugs.

1221
00:49:03,140 --> 00:49:04,480
Things that aren't beef nugs.

1222
00:49:04,480 --> 00:49:05,480
Meatballs.

1223
00:49:05,480 --> 00:49:06,320
Meatballs.

1224
00:49:06,320 --> 00:49:07,820
Yeah, it's just like a chicken nugget.

1225
00:49:07,820 --> 00:49:08,660
No, it's not.

1226
00:49:08,660 --> 00:49:10,240
It's just a little sphere of beef.

1227
00:49:10,240 --> 00:49:11,360
That's not a beef nugget.

1228
00:49:11,360 --> 00:49:15,360
Yeah, what about Jack Link's beef jerky beef nuggets?

1229
00:49:15,360 --> 00:49:16,400
Oh, do you mean that shit

1230
00:49:16,400 --> 00:49:19,960
I literally said while we were recording?

1231
00:49:19,960 --> 00:49:22,840
You literally heard me say that's not a beef nug?

1232
00:49:22,840 --> 00:49:24,000
What about steak?

1233
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:25,900
What about little chunks of steak?

1234
00:49:25,900 --> 00:49:26,960
No, not a beef nug.

1235
00:49:26,960 --> 00:49:28,080
What about steak fingers?

1236
00:49:28,080 --> 00:49:32,780
You literally just said finger, not nugget.

1237
00:49:33,600 --> 00:49:35,080
You all are fucking killing.

1238
00:49:35,080 --> 00:49:35,920
I love you.

1239
00:49:35,920 --> 00:49:36,920
Thank you for the support.

1240
00:49:36,920 --> 00:49:38,480
Thank you for donating to Maximum Fun.

1241
00:49:38,480 --> 00:49:39,400
You really help us.

1242
00:49:39,400 --> 00:49:40,240
I don't know if you can tell,

1243
00:49:40,240 --> 00:49:41,280
I'm recording with a new mud guard.

1244
00:49:41,280 --> 00:49:42,400
I just bought a new mic set up.

1245
00:49:42,400 --> 00:49:46,000
You're gonna enjoy a lot of my just fat sound pipes

1246
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:48,280
next week, things that aren't beef nugs.

1247
00:49:48,280 --> 00:49:50,460
Everything, they don't exist.

1248
00:49:50,460 --> 00:49:53,160
Somebody actually made a video of them making beef nuggets.

1249
00:49:53,160 --> 00:49:54,560
They are the only person on earth

1250
00:49:54,560 --> 00:49:58,320
who has cracked that fucking Dan Brown beefy da Vinci code.

1251
00:49:58,320 --> 00:50:01,320
Everybody else stop telling me meatballs are beef nuggets.

1252
00:50:01,320 --> 00:50:03,680
Oh God, Elizabeth Gilbert, you too.

1253
00:50:03,680 --> 00:50:05,980
You're like the smartest person ever.

1254
00:50:05,980 --> 00:50:08,480
I told her that I thought it was acceptable.

1255
00:50:08,480 --> 00:50:09,800
Yeah, cause you fucking buckled

1256
00:50:09,800 --> 00:50:11,840
under the weight of her massive brain.

1257
00:50:11,840 --> 00:50:13,640
Star power and her charisma.

1258
00:50:13,640 --> 00:50:14,480
I did.

1259
00:50:14,480 --> 00:50:15,800
You're fucking killing me everybody.

1260
00:50:15,800 --> 00:50:17,760
Stop telling me steak fingers are beef nuggets.

1261
00:50:17,760 --> 00:50:19,440
Use your goddamn brain for a second.

1262
00:50:19,440 --> 00:50:21,520
And quit doing it like we're the idiots.

1263
00:50:21,520 --> 00:50:23,760
You're like, oh guys, fucking meatballs,

1264
00:50:23,760 --> 00:50:26,680
fucking steak nuggets from Jack Links.

1265
00:50:26,680 --> 00:50:28,320
You don't think we thought about that?

1266
00:50:28,320 --> 00:50:29,160
You don't think we-

1267
00:50:29,160 --> 00:50:31,720
The steak fingers are what kill me.

1268
00:50:31,720 --> 00:50:34,240
If someone held up a chicken tender in front of you

1269
00:50:34,240 --> 00:50:35,680
and said, this is a chicken nugget,

1270
00:50:35,680 --> 00:50:37,680
you would punch them in their fucking snot locker.

1271
00:50:37,680 --> 00:50:40,400
But first, you'd embarrassingly slap the chicken finger

1272
00:50:40,400 --> 00:50:42,500
out of their hand and then slap them.

1273
00:50:43,600 --> 00:50:45,720
I did have like three or four people actually saying like,

1274
00:50:45,720 --> 00:50:48,720
well, actually in Ethiopian cuisine, that, okay, fine.

1275
00:50:48,720 --> 00:50:50,100
How, but how would I know that?

1276
00:50:50,100 --> 00:50:51,600
How would I know that?

1277
00:50:51,600 --> 00:50:52,560
You have no way of knowing that.

1278
00:50:52,560 --> 00:50:53,800
I have no way of knowing that.

1279
00:50:53,800 --> 00:50:56,040
I will say the person who made the video

1280
00:50:56,040 --> 00:50:58,680
of them like crafting steak, steak nuggets.

1281
00:50:58,680 --> 00:50:59,780
And they like did it.

1282
00:50:59,780 --> 00:51:02,520
They like ground that meat up to the consistency

1283
00:51:02,520 --> 00:51:03,960
that like whatever the consistency,

1284
00:51:03,960 --> 00:51:07,200
whatever the pasty consistency of chicken nugget meat is.

1285
00:51:07,200 --> 00:51:08,040
They crushed that.

1286
00:51:08,040 --> 00:51:11,080
They crushed the, whatever it is with the brining.

1287
00:51:11,080 --> 00:51:11,920
What is it called?

1288
00:51:11,920 --> 00:51:12,760
Dredging.

1289
00:51:12,760 --> 00:51:13,880
Dredge shit, fried that shit up.

1290
00:51:13,880 --> 00:51:15,660
Looked like a chicken nugget.

1291
00:51:15,660 --> 00:51:16,960
That person's doing the Lord's work.

1292
00:51:16,960 --> 00:51:18,920
Actually looked kind of dope.

1293
00:51:18,920 --> 00:51:21,620
I might actually be into that, yes.

1294
00:51:21,620 --> 00:51:23,240
Everybody else just sort of, I guess,

1295
00:51:23,240 --> 00:51:24,900
think before you like do anything.

1296
00:51:24,900 --> 00:51:28,360
Cause you're alive and your actions affect other people.

1297
00:51:28,360 --> 00:51:30,400
You've caused me so much distress.

1298
00:51:30,400 --> 00:51:33,380
I regret bringing up beef nuggets in the first place

1299
00:51:33,380 --> 00:51:37,240
cause it's shaved years off my life, the anger.

1300
00:51:37,240 --> 00:51:39,220
Oh, I don't know when it's going to go away either.

1301
00:51:39,220 --> 00:51:41,060
Cause it's still very hot in my heart.

1302
00:51:41,060 --> 00:51:42,020
We love you very much.

1303
00:51:42,020 --> 00:51:45,880
We love you so much, but just fucking think for a second.

1304
00:51:45,880 --> 00:51:47,120
For a second.

1305
00:51:47,120 --> 00:51:49,460
Make some beef nuggets for your Super Bowl party.

1306
00:51:49,460 --> 00:51:51,300
That's my new command.

1307
00:51:51,300 --> 00:51:55,200
This is your Hail Mary to atone for the sin, so much sin.

1308
00:51:55,200 --> 00:51:56,880
Oh my God, so much sin.

1309
00:51:56,880 --> 00:51:58,840
Just make some beef nuggets, send me pictures.

1310
00:51:58,840 --> 00:52:00,000
Give me a flavor review.

1311
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:00,880
Let me know how it turned out.

1312
00:52:00,880 --> 00:52:02,800
But be careful, it's hot grease.

1313
00:52:02,800 --> 00:52:04,880
Get a parent, get an adult to help you.

1314
00:52:04,880 --> 00:52:05,720
Get an adult to help.

1315
00:52:05,720 --> 00:52:06,880
Don't try and make this without an adult.

1316
00:52:06,880 --> 00:52:07,720
You'll hurt yourself.

1317
00:52:07,720 --> 00:52:09,560
Thank you so much for listening to our podcast,

1318
00:52:09,560 --> 00:52:11,120
my brother, my brother and me.

1319
00:52:11,120 --> 00:52:13,760
Sorry that it was a little bit angry,

1320
00:52:13,760 --> 00:52:15,140
I guess towards you in there.

1321
00:52:15,140 --> 00:52:16,880
You just don't know what it's like to be us.

1322
00:52:16,880 --> 00:52:18,060
I'm trying to keep it a hundred.

1323
00:52:18,060 --> 00:52:19,280
I'm trying to like be legit.

1324
00:52:19,280 --> 00:52:21,120
And I don't want to disguise my feelings.

1325
00:52:21,120 --> 00:52:22,280
I want to be the real me.

1326
00:52:22,280 --> 00:52:24,260
And the real me is so fucking mad.

1327
00:52:26,160 --> 00:52:28,080
But we do have a present for you.

1328
00:52:28,080 --> 00:52:29,800
A lot of you Chicago folks were upset

1329
00:52:29,800 --> 00:52:32,960
because you didn't get tickets to the show

1330
00:52:32,960 --> 00:52:35,200
we're doing there on April 5th.

1331
00:52:35,200 --> 00:52:38,440
But we've got great news for you.

1332
00:52:38,440 --> 00:52:41,400
We are moving the whole,

1333
00:52:41,400 --> 00:52:44,080
we're picking up the show wholesale

1334
00:52:44,080 --> 00:52:48,120
and moving it to the Athenium Theater in Chicago.

1335
00:52:48,120 --> 00:52:53,120
And it will seat roughly 650 more of you or so.

1336
00:52:54,380 --> 00:52:57,840
So if you're in Chicago and don't ever,

1337
00:52:57,840 --> 00:53:00,040
and if you don't come to the show,

1338
00:53:00,040 --> 00:53:02,000
you can never complain about us not coming there again.

1339
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:04,920
We have room for literally every person who's ever listened.

1340
00:53:04,920 --> 00:53:06,880
If you already have tickets, do not worry.

1341
00:53:06,880 --> 00:53:08,800
They carry over, so you're already set.

1342
00:53:08,800 --> 00:53:09,800
You don't have to worry about it.

1343
00:53:09,800 --> 00:53:11,760
If you don't have tickets,

1344
00:53:11,760 --> 00:53:13,780
they go on sale the 27th at noon.

1345
00:53:13,780 --> 00:53:16,840
So when this comes out on Monday, they come out Tuesday.

1346
00:53:16,840 --> 00:53:19,360
Noon, noon, your time Chicago, noon central.

1347
00:53:19,360 --> 00:53:21,800
And while there are lots more tickets available,

1348
00:53:21,800 --> 00:53:22,620
don't sit on it

1349
00:53:22,620 --> 00:53:24,960
because we're not going to do any other shows there.

1350
00:53:24,960 --> 00:53:27,640
And ever, this is it.

1351
00:53:27,640 --> 00:53:28,840
We're shutting it down.

1352
00:53:28,840 --> 00:53:29,840
This is our last one.

1353
00:53:29,840 --> 00:53:31,280
Farewell the Chicago tour.

1354
00:53:31,280 --> 00:53:32,780
It is assigned seating.

1355
00:53:32,780 --> 00:53:34,600
Unlike a lot of our shows, it's assigned seats.

1356
00:53:34,600 --> 00:53:39,440
So you'll want to get there early and to buy your tickets

1357
00:53:39,440 --> 00:53:41,800
so you can make sure you get your whole party together.

1358
00:53:41,800 --> 00:53:44,440
Like we said, if you already got tickets, good news.

1359
00:53:44,440 --> 00:53:45,540
You are set.

1360
00:53:45,540 --> 00:53:47,440
You got the primo seats.

1361
00:53:47,440 --> 00:53:48,680
And this is not an exaggeration.

1362
00:53:48,680 --> 00:53:51,180
The first show sold out in like seven minutes.

1363
00:53:51,180 --> 00:53:54,380
So this is a thing where when we say don't sit on it,

1364
00:53:54,380 --> 00:53:56,760
we mean like don't wait.

1365
00:53:56,760 --> 00:53:58,720
It might seem like we're big timing you here.

1366
00:53:58,720 --> 00:54:00,400
We seriously would not.

1367
00:54:00,400 --> 00:54:02,480
We're just like, we really want everybody

1368
00:54:02,480 --> 00:54:03,720
to be able to tell who wants to come.

1369
00:54:03,720 --> 00:54:05,840
We were super, like it's obviously great

1370
00:54:05,840 --> 00:54:07,520
when our shows sell out.

1371
00:54:07,520 --> 00:54:12,160
Like my heart swells up with pride and happiness.

1372
00:54:12,160 --> 00:54:13,320
But like when it happens that fast,

1373
00:54:13,320 --> 00:54:14,280
man, I feel super shitty.

1374
00:54:14,280 --> 00:54:16,320
Cause I know there's a lot of people who didn't get in.

1375
00:54:16,320 --> 00:54:18,960
So good luck.

1376
00:54:18,960 --> 00:54:21,880
May the fortune be ever in your favor, Hunger Games.

1377
00:54:21,880 --> 00:54:23,480
Also, there are still tickets available

1378
00:54:23,480 --> 00:54:24,720
for the Milwaukee show too.

1379
00:54:24,720 --> 00:54:25,960
So if you're in Milwaukee

1380
00:54:25,960 --> 00:54:27,840
and haven't gotten tickets for that, it's-

1381
00:54:27,840 --> 00:54:29,920
Not a ton, it's like 70% sold out.

1382
00:54:29,920 --> 00:54:31,620
So don't, if you've been holding off,

1383
00:54:31,620 --> 00:54:33,080
like I wouldn't wait much longer.

1384
00:54:33,080 --> 00:54:37,240
Bit.ly forward slash mill, M-B-M-B-A-M.

1385
00:54:40,560 --> 00:54:42,400
I want to thank John Roderick in the long winters

1386
00:54:42,400 --> 00:54:43,360
for the use of our theme song.

1387
00:54:43,360 --> 00:54:46,680
It's a departure off the album, Putting the Days to Bed.

1388
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:48,880
Lovely album.

1389
00:54:48,880 --> 00:54:51,880
It's a good one to just sort of, as the seasons change,

1390
00:54:51,880 --> 00:54:56,200
to just sort of welcome spring into your heart.

1391
00:54:56,200 --> 00:54:58,720
It's January, but that's like spring in Texas.

1392
00:54:58,720 --> 00:55:01,080
Anyway, just listen to it and it'll make you feel good.

1393
00:55:01,080 --> 00:55:02,280
Cause the music's good.

1394
00:55:02,280 --> 00:55:03,200
And we still need questions

1395
00:55:03,200 --> 00:55:05,400
for our LA and San Francisco shows.

1396
00:55:05,400 --> 00:55:06,960
So if you're going to be at their shows

1397
00:55:06,960 --> 00:55:08,040
and want to hear your questions,

1398
00:55:08,040 --> 00:55:09,740
make sure that you put in the subject line,

1399
00:55:09,740 --> 00:55:12,480
either LA show or SF show.

1400
00:55:12,480 --> 00:55:14,000
And if you're coming to the LA show,

1401
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:15,240
we're going to have lots of merch.

1402
00:55:15,240 --> 00:55:16,320
When we were here in June,

1403
00:55:16,320 --> 00:55:19,020
there was a little bit of a mix up and we didn't have merch.

1404
00:55:19,020 --> 00:55:21,100
Don't worry, we've got lots of merch at this show.

1405
00:55:21,100 --> 00:55:23,280
So look forward to that.

1406
00:55:23,280 --> 00:55:25,080
And if you're not going to be at the LA show,

1407
00:55:25,080 --> 00:55:28,600
all of that merch is available at maxfundstore.com,

1408
00:55:28,600 --> 00:55:29,560
except for the posters.

1409
00:55:29,560 --> 00:55:31,980
Those are, the blue posters are only available

1410
00:55:31,980 --> 00:55:33,120
at the live shows.

1411
00:55:34,040 --> 00:55:36,160
You can follow us on Twitter, but don't,

1412
00:55:36,160 --> 00:55:37,680
none of it matters.

1413
00:55:37,680 --> 00:55:39,080
And YouTube, that's all right.

1414
00:55:39,080 --> 00:55:41,120
That's like good content, I guess.

1415
00:55:41,120 --> 00:55:44,280
Go to youtube.com slash N-B-N-B-A-M, right?

1416
00:55:44,280 --> 00:55:45,120
Yes.

1417
00:55:45,120 --> 00:55:45,960
And that's where you can find

1418
00:55:45,960 --> 00:55:47,960
all kinds of great video content.

1419
00:55:47,960 --> 00:55:50,560
We got a new short that Tyler Crowley did for us

1420
00:55:50,560 --> 00:55:53,320
about Scott Jenkins and Tip of the Dragon Penis.

1421
00:55:53,320 --> 00:55:54,520
It's pretty goddamn good.

1422
00:55:54,520 --> 00:55:56,600
It's pretty much my favorite one so far.

1423
00:55:56,600 --> 00:55:58,820
I still like Shitty Iron Man the best.

1424
00:55:58,820 --> 00:56:00,880
We're on iTunes, go right and review us there.

1425
00:56:00,880 --> 00:56:03,040
We have P.O. Boxes if you want to send us stuff.

1426
00:56:03,040 --> 00:56:06,880
It's P.O. Box 34, Honey to West Virginia, 2576 for me.

1427
00:56:06,880 --> 00:56:11,880
Or P.O. Box 34, 1769, Los Angeles, California, 90034

1428
00:56:13,160 --> 00:56:14,280
for West Coast stuff.

1429
00:56:15,300 --> 00:56:17,040
Go listen to the other Max Fun Shows too.

1430
00:56:17,040 --> 00:56:19,720
We all have other shows if you like listening

1431
00:56:19,720 --> 00:56:20,560
to our voices.

1432
00:56:20,560 --> 00:56:22,120
We got Saw Bones, that's Justin Sidney's

1433
00:56:22,120 --> 00:56:24,480
medical history podcast.

1434
00:56:24,480 --> 00:56:26,040
Bunker Buddies, that Travis and Andy do

1435
00:56:26,040 --> 00:56:26,980
about the apocalypse.

1436
00:56:26,980 --> 00:56:28,080
We do the Adventure Zone.

1437
00:56:28,080 --> 00:56:29,280
We'll have a new episode of the Adventure Zone

1438
00:56:29,280 --> 00:56:30,760
this Thursday, that's one that the three of us do

1439
00:56:30,760 --> 00:56:32,040
with our dad when we play D&D.

1440
00:56:32,040 --> 00:56:33,480
There's other shows though that are on the network

1441
00:56:33,480 --> 00:56:35,800
like Jordan Jesse Go, Judge Sean Hongeman,

1442
00:56:35,800 --> 00:56:37,560
Stop Podcasting Yourself, Throwing Shade,

1443
00:56:37,560 --> 00:56:40,160
The Goose Down, Lady to Lady, Baby Geniuses,

1444
00:56:40,160 --> 00:56:44,320
Destination DIY, Song Exploder, The Memory Palace,

1445
00:56:44,320 --> 00:56:48,160
Pop Rocket, fuck, I did my best.

1446
00:56:48,160 --> 00:56:49,400
Did you mention Flop House?

1447
00:56:49,400 --> 00:56:50,240
The Flop House.

1448
00:56:50,240 --> 00:56:51,080
Because that's like my favorite podcast right now.

1449
00:56:51,080 --> 00:56:52,760
It's really, really good.

1450
00:56:52,760 --> 00:56:57,760
Also, the Max Fun Family is kick starting a video project

1451
00:56:57,760 --> 00:57:01,800
called Brian and Lindsey Will Totally Eat That

1452
00:57:02,800 --> 00:57:06,240
where Brian and Lindsey eat things and review them.

1453
00:57:06,240 --> 00:57:07,640
And it's very funny.

1454
00:57:07,640 --> 00:57:08,680
Check out the kick starter.

1455
00:57:08,680 --> 00:57:10,680
You can watch sort of the pitch video for that

1456
00:57:10,680 --> 00:57:12,120
and throw some money their way

1457
00:57:12,120 --> 00:57:14,360
if you wanna make that video exist in the world.

1458
00:57:14,360 --> 00:57:16,120
And if you go to Maximumfun.gov,

1459
00:57:16,120 --> 00:57:20,400
you can find the Vor podcast, Big Gulp that Griffin hosts.

1460
00:57:20,400 --> 00:57:22,680
That's not where Big Gulp is.

1461
00:57:22,680 --> 00:57:25,960
Big Gulp is, I couldn't lock down the.gov.

1462
00:57:25,960 --> 00:57:27,120

It's been my brother, my brother, me.

1481
00:58:03,220 --> 00:58:05,080
Kiss your dad, square out the lips.

1482

We're the stars of Maximum Fun's first web video series,

00:58:37,220 --> 00:58:39,500
Brian and Lindsay Will Totally Eat That.

1490
00:58:39,500 --> 00:58:41,740
Someone throws us a snack, we eat it,

1491
00:58:41,740 --> 00:58:44,960
and then we rate it on a scale from yummy to crummy.

1492
00:58:44,960 --> 00:58:47,140
We have recorded a pilot, and we're raising funding

1493
00:58:47,140 --> 00:58:49,900
for the series on Kickstarter until February 20th.

1494
00:58:49,900 --> 00:58:51,580
And if we receive enough backers,

1495
00:58:51,580 --> 00:58:53,740
we will receive a huge challenge grant

1496
00:58:53,740 --> 00:58:55,620
