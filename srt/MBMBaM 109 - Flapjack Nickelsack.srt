1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:30,720
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:48,480
Hello, and welcome to my brother, my brother and me, an advice show for the modern era.

6
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:52,240
I am your oldest brother, Justin McElroy. I'm your middle-est brother, Travis McElroy.

7
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:58,720
I'm your baby brother, Griffin. It's dad's day, obviously, and I thought we could

8
00:00:58,720 --> 00:01:08,240
start off by remembering some of our dad's best zingers. I'll start to give you guys

9
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:17,760
time to think about it. We were in a parking lot, and someone, this guy was walking across

10
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:25,120
the parking lot and blocking my dad's progress to our dad's progress to a parking space,

11
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:32,720
and this gentleman was walking slowly in front of dad and not in any way expediting his travel.

12
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:40,800
And he yelled at the guy in the car with the windows rolled up because we're Baptists,

13
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:46,640
he yelled at the guy, hey, this hat-wearing geek-a-boy needs to get out of the way.

14
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:52,400
And the gentleman was not wearing a hat, so I don't know why.

15
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:53,760
She had to be wearing a hat.

16
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:58,880
I'm not sure why hat-wearing geek-a-boy was the fucking zinger that dad decided

17
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:04,960
to apply to this gentleman. Maybe he had a hat. Time has etched away so much of this memory.

18
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:06,560
It's hard to say.

19
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:10,640
But I think my favorite is the time that we were all sitting in the back seat,

20
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:15,680
and we were having a spat, as young brothers are like to do, smacking one another and

21
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:21,440
hitting each other. And dad turns around from the driver's seat and says,

22
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:26,240
you guys stop fiddly farting around back there. And all three of us stopped.

23
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:27,520
And we're like, excuse me?

24
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:33,360
That story gives some, that story applies to our dad as a sort of Flandersian charm.

25
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:40,320
My favorite is the time that he was up in the attic arranging his comic book collection,

26
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:44,960
and he took the screen out of the window because it was so hot,

27
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:49,040
and then he bent down to pick up a box of comics and cut his butt wide open

28
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:54,160
on the edge of the screen. And then we didn't have any bandages big enough to go on his new,

29
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:59,360
his butt gash. And so he, he duct taped a maxi pad to his butt.

30
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:04,640
Oh, do we want to go through just the list of times dad's injured himself?

31
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:08,000
Cause there was a time he dumped bleach and kitty litter down the sink without

32
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:12,560
seeing a problem with it and passed out in the basement for several hours.

33
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:19,200
His fellow DJ, when explaining why he was not on the show the next morning said,

34
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:23,040
announced to Huntington, West Virginia that our dad was free basing kitty litter.

35
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:32,880
Probably the saddest injury that he got was he was, if I had seen, okay,

36
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:41,600
he was bringing a tray of cold cuts to a little league game and a van drove past him

37
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:47,360
and the rear view mirror, like the side view mirror was so close that it blasted him in the

38
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:54,160
chest sending cold cuts flying. If I had seen this happen, I would fucking still be laughing

39
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:56,720
about it. No question. Like a scene from The Godfather just

40
00:03:56,720 --> 00:04:04,480
Bastromi and Rose B floating through the air. Cup of cold, everywhere. I would, oh man,

41
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:10,000
I would give anything. A slow opera music played and you just saw like the tray flipping over and

42
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:17,040
over in the air. And I remember we were all in the car to the ER, and he was not that badly hurt,

43
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:23,440
so you can laugh at home. It's fine. We were all in the car to the ER and a lady that worked with

44
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:29,040
dad was praying over him and just, oh Lord, we just ask that you watch over brother Clint

45
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:33,280
and just help to protect him as we take him into the hands of the doctors. And I know

46
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:37,200
you are going to work through those doctor's hands. And in my head I'm thinking,

47
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:41,200
that was carrying cold cuts. He got blasted by a side view mirror. Let's not bother God

48
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:46,560
about this one. That's so false. That got hit by a car that was like driving at him.

49
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:52,400
Let's not bother God with this one. I think this one's pretty squarely on my dad's shoulders.

50
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:58,720
He just couldn't ditch the cold cuts. He didn't want to sacrifice the cold cuts for his own

51
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:00,560
safety. He's a martyr really. Yeah.

52
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:02,320
Right. What a big dumb animal.

53
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:05,120
Hey, love you dad. Love you daddy.

54
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:08,560
You big stupid Yeti.

55
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:14,160
That's me. And like, you know what's weird is I'll watch a, we have a bunch of home movies

56
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:18,560
from those days. There was a weird window for those of you who are too young to remember it.

57
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:26,400
There was a weird window when tapes, VHS recorders that you could put on your shoulder came into

58
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:32,560
Vogue. And the idea of being able to record events was so novel that you would just record everything.

59
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:33,520
Like everything.

60
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:35,520
Like everything. And it's great.

61
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:38,400
And look, they're sitting outside. I better film it.

62
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:44,640
Yeah, right. So we have DVDs full of this stuff. And I realized that the DVDs we have

63
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:54,480
start when I was five years old, meaning that dad would have been, dad was 25 when I was married.

64
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:59,680
So he would have been 31 in these videos. And that's how old I am. I have, we have reached

65
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:04,320
the singularity. Like all, I have full documentation of how it's going to go.

66
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:08,080
From here on out, you can chart your progress.

67
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:10,160
Exactly. Like I know exactly where I'm headed.

68
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:16,640
Anyway, thank you for indulging us as we reminisce about our papa. I'm sure you have

69
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:24,240
a story that you can share aloud as you talk over us, but we're going to move on to some advice.

70
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:31,840
A first question. I've been told recently that I will be getting my braces taken off on the 20th

71
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:40,320
of June. The solstice. I remember that Griffin said that's the best day to get them off.

72
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:42,560
I read that in poor Richard's Almanac.

73
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:46,240
Oh, because you get 12 hours of sunshine on your teeth and 12 hours of darkness.

74
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:48,880
Exactly. You can stand an egg on your teeth.

75
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:54,480
Is exactly. I remember that Griffin said he had braces. My question to you is this,

76
00:06:54,480 --> 00:07:00,640
will it be painful on a scale of one to 10, one being a tickled 10 being forced to listen to

77
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:06,880
Justin Bieber? How painful is it? That's soon to be not brace face in Ireland.

78
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:12,320
There's a lot of unfair misconceptions in this question. I think the first being that Justin

79
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:15,440
Bieber get over it guys.

80
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,760
Yeah. Come on people. It's not his fault.

81
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:23,680
Just kidding. No, I mean, he, he writes solid music. You're, you're coming at this all wrong

82
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:29,360
because you're asking this apparatus that has been like dragging my teeth around my mouth

83
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:34,640
for however many years that sucks so bad. I'm getting it removed from my face so it

84
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:38,320
can't do that to me anymore. Is that going to hurt? No, it's the opposite of that.

85
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:43,200
It's it's been, it's been hurting you for so, so long and you don't even realize it.

86
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:48,000
Well, you probably like the dental equivalent of that scene in Forrest Gump where he runs so hard

87
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:54,320
that the braces fly off his legs. That's pretty much it. You just start chewing and she's like,

88
00:07:54,320 --> 00:08:01,600
chew for his chew. Yeah. No, they just make you smile like really hard. They make you pop off.

89
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:08,640
Um, no. Wow. Medical science sure has come a long way. It's unpleasant. I'm glad this is all true.

90
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:14,240
It's unpleasant in the way that like when people apply force to your teeth. Oh God. Is there anything

91
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:18,800
worse than that? I don't care if you're like, I don't care what they're doing in there. I just

92
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:23,440
don't want anybody to apply any amount of force to my teeth. I don't even like chewing hard foods

93
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:29,040
for this very reason. Um, but, but no, it doesn't, it doesn't hurt. It's pretty much the best thing

94
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:34,560
ever. There's a market, a market difference in my life. The day I got my first thing you ate

95
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:39,280
when you got your braces. Oh yeah. What was the first thing you ate? Um, well, I mean, they were

96
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:45,760
a little delicate. So, so probably some sort of porridge. Um, okay. What was the first contraband

97
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:52,640
food? Do you fucking really think that I was the kind of kid who like would stay with, would shy

98
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:59,680
from Doritos? No way. No way. That does explain a lot about how your teeth ended up. I would rock.

99
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:04,880
Oh, you fuck off. I here's the, here's the lie that you're not going to be ready for.

100
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:11,840
Ms. Mr. Mrs. soon to be braced face in Ireland. Um, when you get your braces off, your teeth are

101
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:16,720
going to fucking move. They're going to move again. I wore my retainers. No joke. Every day

102
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:22,480
for six months and every night for two years. My shit's all jacked up. My grill is all jacked up

103
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:28,080
again. Nothing you can do about it. Um, I like your grill though. Yeah. Yeah. It's got a,

104
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:32,800
it's got like a Kirsten Dunst charm. And I think that that's important. Your teeth are like the

105
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:38,240
inglorious bastard. It splits the, no, it splits the uprights between Dunst and Buscemi. And I

106
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:44,400
think that's important. Um, but, but I've got large gaps in my teeth, but mom and dad, I don't know.

107
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:48,720
The times must've been tight. It must've been tighter. Oh no. You know that. No, at that point,

108
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:52,880
no, David, David Letterman was really popular and they were just hoping that you could cash in on

109
00:09:52,880 --> 00:10:00,400
that. No. You know who's big right now? Warren Bacall. Justin's going to catch that fever. Um,

110
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:04,880
we don't want to argue about whose grill was more jacked. Um, and during our childhood,

111
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:10,400
because Oh fuck it was mine. Look like a fence built by a drunk person for a plate of biscuits,

112
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:16,800
for a plate of biscuits. It's, it was, it was rough stuff in there. My mouth looked like the fucking

113
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:23,120
Sarlacc pit. Um, I always had really great teeth and then one day my gum started spontaneously

114
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:27,520
bleeding. So I don't know who wins and who loses. Cause you gotta brush them you silly goose.

115
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:33,840
You gotta brush up there. Um, but it's, it, I mean it may suck, but holy shit, it's going to be the

116
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:41,280
best day of your entire life. Um, so yeah, enjoy. I'm happy for you. Everyone get braces. How come

117
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:47,200
adults don't get braces anymore? Um, I don't know. I always, when I see an adult with braces,

118
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:52,000
I always imagine someone trying to recapture their youth, which there are many better ways.

119
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:57,920
You know who looked good? Bill Macy and Magnolia. Oh man. Didn't he look great with those,

120
00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:04,320
that shining, shining plate mail up on his mouth? Did that look great up there? Didn't see Magnolia.

121
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:11,040
What about, I'm sure. So Travis, did you see it? I don't know which one that is. You

122
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:18,240
uncultured Fox. Sorry, Griffin. Hey, how about you? How about you class this joint up a bit though?

123
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:23,520
Oh, with a Yahoo answer? What's the classiest of Yahoo answers? Whatever the classiest one you got

124
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:30,960
is. Um, how about this one? It was sent in by Nick Claus or Klaus. Nick, Nick Claus. Thank you,

125
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:42,000
Nick. It's by Yahoo answers user Yahoo mystery who asks guitar or bow and arrows. I have $100.

126
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:48,960
I'm a 14 year old male. I've been wanting a guitar for a couple of years and I've wanted a bow

127
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:55,440
ever since I saw teen Wolf last summer. I got interested in the guitar from YouTube videos.

128
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:59,040
And because I got interested in music a couple of years ago when I was in fifth grade, I'm pretty

129
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:04,080
sure I just want to know which one I should get. I don't have anything to do in the summer. I have

130
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:11,520
some reading I can do, but I don't know if I'm in the class yet. Thanks. Okay. So happy. This is

131
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:18,320
like reading a, uh, uh, this is like, this is like watching that, um, the summer version of Christmas

132
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:25,280
story. You know that reading a nostalgic Jean Shepherd novel, uh, in one Yahoo answer. I love

133
00:12:25,280 --> 00:12:30,400
it because it's kind of like a rest of the story kind of set up. Like you can see the two paths

134
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:36,160
diverge in one. He gets the guitar and becomes like the next Jimi Hendrix and the other, he gets

135
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:41,280
a bow and arrow and shoots his little brother in the face. I thought you were going to say he

136
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:46,000
becomes the Jimi Hendrix of archery because we didn't know any archers. He's doing a wicked

137
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:53,440
bow and arrow solo. So riddle me this real quick teen Wolf. The film doesn't have a bow and arrow.

138
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:59,360
No, it has to be like the TV show teen Wolf, which I, to this day, I'm unsure if it's a spin-off of

139
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:04,720
the movie or not, but I don't believe it. Yeah. There's like a 50 year old styles who

140
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:13,520
the comic book shop and sells people bows and arrows. It's cannon. Is this just somebody who

141
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:20,560
saw hunger games and it's like, God, I get down on that. That's a good look. That's practical.

142
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:25,840
Cool. Right. You got to know, have some sort of skill by the time when Quetzalcoatl comes.

143
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:30,080
This is someone who saw the hit film weather man with Nicolas Cage. And he's like, yeah,

144
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:36,560
bow and arrow. I could do that. Go home. Go, go away. What? You don't like that film?

145
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:42,720
It's, I mean, it's not Jermaine. It's from like 1981. That movie was released. It's basically

146
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:47,520
like the same as hunger games. Like hunger games and weather man are based on the same level.

147
00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:53,760
And how other man's a cool movie. Yeah. Way cooler than hunger games. Welcome to our movie

148
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:58,240
review castle where you compare two utterly disparate movies and make one be the best.

149
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:06,640
I have this question may as an elderly gentleman. This question makes me so nostalgic for a time

150
00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:14,320
when I have $100. I can buy one of two things. Those two things are a guitar or a bow and arrow.

151
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:21,040
Like that's the only time money was cool. Now money is symbolic. Like I see money and it's like,

152
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:26,960
thank you for the gas in my house. Like, thank you for the lights are on. This kid's like,

153
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:32,320
I have a hundred dollar bill. I'm going to buy a fucking guitar or maybe a weapon.

154
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:39,600
I, uh, I still get this way. I still, I came into $500 recently that I was not expecting to get.

155
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:46,400
And it was almost like the hunt was fucking on. It was like, what can I put this on? What can I

156
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:50,800
make mine with this money? It's not real money because it's not, you know, it's not.

157
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:56,080
Yeah. Like I recently got paid and I was like, yeah, I'm going to get my brakes fixed. So I

158
00:14:56,080 --> 00:15:03,120
don't die. No, no, no, no, no. I payment, payment and compensation for work. That's that is money.

159
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:07,680
That's money that you have that you need. I sold a computer that I didn't think I was going to sell.

160
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:12,640
Yeah. And I was like, I have this money now and it's not real money. Cause it's, it's,

161
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:17,040
it's surprise money. And I bought it. I should have done bought an iPad. Cause that's what I

162
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:23,920
did do. No, you should have bought your computer back from the person. They're finding your power.

163
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:30,000
I could have bought five bows and arrows and then my friends and I could have hawk eyed

164
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:35,360
all around Austin writing wrongs and shooting people and tires.

165
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:42,800
Um, I don't know. Is this what things cost now are both bows. I'm just saying go with bow and arrow

166
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:49,360
for show because $100 is going to buy you a really shitty guitar. It's going to buy you a first act

167
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:54,880
toy. Oh, I bet you I could buy you an okay bow though. At least like a recurve compound,

168
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:58,880
like the gears and police. There's no way you're getting a compound. Yeah.

169
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:02,400
Guys. Have you guys ever, let me ask you a serious question. I hate to

170
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:06,960
serious this up, but have you guys ever seriously considered buying a bow and arrow?

171
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:07,280
Yes. Yes.

172
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:15,920
Well, okay. Arrows. Let's, let's, let's, let's go hog wild by multiple arrows.

173
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:20,880
So in high school, there are many options as to what kind of gym class you could take.

174
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:25,520
And I opted to take individual dual sports, which was like nerd sports.

175
00:16:25,520 --> 00:16:31,120
And so it was sports like ping pong. Yeah. Yeah. And one of them was archery.

176
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:35,440
I was on that same track, I think. I think backgammon was part of it.

177
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:38,320
It was literally like they looked at the rest of my schedule and said,

178
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:41,600
taking a lot of theater classes, huh? Have we got the gym class for you?

179
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:43,040
How do you feel about tumbling?

180
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:48,080
If we have a spinning class, you'd be doing that.

181
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:50,720
What about crocanol? Are you down?

182
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:56,800
So we did archery for like two days and that shit is dope. It's awesome.

183
00:16:56,800 --> 00:17:01,280
Well, it's not, when you're using a translatable skill,

184
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:04,800
when you're using what is tantamount to a first act, a bow and arrow,

185
00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:10,160
it's pretty awesome. But if you ever try to shoot a real bow and arrow,

186
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:14,480
unless you possess tremendous amounts of upper body strength,

187
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:19,040
you shake like you are experiencing an earthquake that only you can feel.

188
00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:20,640
And it's humiliating.

189
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:23,360
I want to point out that we were going to school in West Virginia.

190
00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:25,840
A kid brought in his compound bow.

191
00:17:25,840 --> 00:17:29,920
Well, a compound bow has has tools built into it to help you pull it back.

192
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:31,840
But if you ever try to fire like a real ass,

193
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:34,880
you're talking like a long bow, like a gentleman's old ass archer.

194
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:36,480
Like a gentleman's bow.

195
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:42,320
For, yeah, right. A manly, like something for killing.

196
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:46,000
Yeah, like an adult bow and an adult caveman bow.

197
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:49,280
Hey, one of my friends insists on going swimming every time.

198
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:55,440
What is the demo of our fucking show?

199
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:58,240
We talk about fucking girls with Garfield heads.

200
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:03,200
Where are these teens who are like, listen, my favorite flavor of pixie stick got canceled.

201
00:18:05,680 --> 00:18:10,400
Guys, I got cheeto dust all over my hands and there's a big line to hop in the pool.

202
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:11,120
What should I do?

203
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:13,760
I'm just glad everybody's out there having a killer fun.

204
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:16,960
Just read through this question. It takes an interesting turn.

205
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:20,800
OK, one of my friends insists on going swimming every time he comes to visit.

206
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:24,880
He always brings his trunks and shows up with the expectation of going swimming,

207
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:28,480
which wouldn't be annoying, except that the pool belongs to my neighbors.

208
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:32,080
I very much enjoy swimming and my neighbors are good people,

209
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:35,120
but that doesn't mean I'm free to swim there whenever I want.

210
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:39,040
For whatever reason, my friend fails to understand that this is not my pool

211
00:18:39,040 --> 00:18:41,280
and I do not want to abuse my neighbor's kindness.

212
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:45,360
How can I remedy this situation without coming off as a jerk?

213
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:47,760
That's from drowning in Des Moines.

214
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:51,040
It's easy. Tell your friend to stop being a moron.

215
00:18:51,040 --> 00:18:51,920
It's not your pool.

216
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:55,600
And say, hey, hey, it's not my pool.

217
00:18:56,800 --> 00:18:57,920
No, that's too easy.

218
00:18:57,920 --> 00:18:59,040
No, yeah.

219
00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:00,240
We should have something harder.

220
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:02,160
That pool? It's infested.

221
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:02,640
I mean, you just...

222
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:07,760
It's us, so we should have a more complex solution with a higher probability of arrest.

223
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:12,080
You gotta come up with a system for warning your neighbors.

224
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:15,200
Like, hey, Bryce, Bryce is a coming. You know what that means.

225
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:17,120
Time to cover the pool.

226
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:19,520
Just leave the gate open. We'll see you at eight.

227
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:20,020
Eight.

228
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:22,880
Have some burgers ready.

229
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:23,440
We're gonna be hungry.

230
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:24,400
Get some burgers ready.

231
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:26,000
My tie's at nine.

232
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:26,480
Let's roll.

233
00:19:28,560 --> 00:19:30,640
You and your wife can totally join us.

234
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:33,120
Wet teacher contest at 10 PM.

235
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:36,400
Will you and Mrs. Robinson be there?

236
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:38,000
I sure hope so.

237
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,440
I'm sorry, what was her last name?

238
00:19:40,560 --> 00:19:42,000
Well, can you repeat that?

239
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,560
Let me take the wall down for you.

240
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:47,120
I was gonna say Mrs. Robinson,

241
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:51,040
and then I realized that that has some context outside of my goof

242
00:19:51,040 --> 00:19:52,880
that may not make the goof pan out,

243
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:56,640
because then it would be like, oh, she's sexy and she's down with younger men.

244
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:57,920
That's not what I was going for.

245
00:19:57,920 --> 00:19:59,840
So instead you went with a Klingon word.

246
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:01,360
I went with Romakhov.

247
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:05,120
We are engaging in the battle of Romakhov.

248
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:07,760
Your friend is a fucking idiot.

249
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:10,320
How does he not get...

250
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:12,000
How does he not get, like...

251
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:14,960
Oh man, this makes me so angry.

252
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:18,880
This makes me angry, like how we had a basketball court in our backyard

253
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:21,840
and our neighbors would just be like, what's up, hoop dreams?

254
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:24,160
And I'm like, hey, if you don't mind,

255
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:29,280
if you don't mind, it's midnight and I'm watching a movie in here

256
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:30,880
trying to get my swerve on maybe.

257
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:34,720
If you could like cut the hoop dreams for a second.

258
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:36,640
Make them like hoop daydreams.

259
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:37,360
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

260
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:41,520
If you're gonna have hoop when I'm at school dreams, that would be good.

261
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:42,160
That's fine.

262
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:44,320
That's fine.

263
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:46,880
And just to make sure we're all on the same page,

264
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:50,000
we picture this friend rolling up ringing the doorbell when you open the door.

265
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,840
He's got a towel slung over his shoulder.

266
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:52,800
He's in trunks.

267
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:54,000
Water wings.

268
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:54,320
Okay.

269
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:54,640
Yeah.

270
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:55,120
He's got...

271
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:55,680
I got those...

272
00:20:57,200 --> 00:21:00,080
What are those things that make your feet like a fish?

273
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:02,480
Flippers?

274
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:03,280
Thank you.

275
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:03,840
What the fuck?

276
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:05,040
Yeah, I think flippers.

277
00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:07,120
Is that what it is?

278
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:08,400
Did you have a piece?

279
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:10,560
He's just wearing a full on mermaid tail.

280
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:11,840
Let's do this.

281
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:16,800
I know flippers are what you put in to make your toddler's teeth not look so wack.

282
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:19,200
So I didn't know if that was the same thing.

283
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:19,760
Same word.

284
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:23,680
I think here's the solution.

285
00:21:24,560 --> 00:21:27,520
You need to cut yourself out as the middleman.

286
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:31,040
You need to go next door, introduce your friend to the neighbors and be like,

287
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:32,000
it's up to you now.

288
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,040
Like this is all on you.

289
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:34,560
Now you guys are friends.

290
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:36,080
I ain't got no dog in this race.

291
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:36,400
This is...

292
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:38,080
Bryce is gonna be staying with you for the weekend.

293
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:39,200
This is Bryce.

294
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:40,640
He loves tacos.

295
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:41,680
Take good care of him.

296
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:43,120
And also swimming.

297
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:43,920
He's my old buddy.

298
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:47,040
What was that?

299
00:21:47,040 --> 00:21:48,320
That's me blowing my nose.

300
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:49,280
Don't address it.

301
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:49,600
Fuck.

302
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:53,360
It sounded like a ghost going through a tunnel.

303
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:54,000
I know, that was horrifying.

304
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,920
It was terrifying.

305
00:21:55,920 --> 00:21:59,200
I thought that for a second our podcast would become possessed.

306
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:03,760
It sounded like when the Grim Reaper slips past your ear.

307
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:04,640
Like he just barely went dying.

308
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:08,080
Oh no, someone has literally walked over my grave and then dug it up

309
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:09,920
and started punching my corpse.

310
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:11,920
And blowing in my ear, gross.

311
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:13,120
Stop it, I'm getting a boner.

312
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:17,360
How does he not know?

313
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:21,440
Like one house is your house and there is not a pool behind it.

314
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:22,640
I'm gonna go out on a limb.

315
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:25,120
Maybe that's how he's getting to the pool.

316
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:31,520
I'm gonna guess that you feel that you've clearly expressed to your friend

317
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:34,320
that it is not okay and it's not a good deal,

318
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:38,240
but I'm betting that you've maybe been a little too subtle

319
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:40,400
and said something along the lines of like,

320
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:43,840
I don't know, they're busy or how about you need to say like,

321
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:45,040
listen, dude, it's not cool.

322
00:22:45,040 --> 00:22:47,040
I don't feel comfortable going over there.

323
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:48,080
It's not my pool.

324
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:51,280
We did it that one time and it was awesome because they invited us over.

325
00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:53,760
We don't have free reign over it.

326
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:55,600
You can always just throw it on them.

327
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:57,520
Just say like they said we couldn't go anymore.

328
00:22:58,400 --> 00:22:59,760
It's a tough break, huh?

329
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:01,440
Well, win some, you lose some.

330
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:02,560
Let's play Atari.

331
00:23:02,560 --> 00:23:06,160
Mr. Raghman Shah died in that pool.

332
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:09,280
And now he's got a pool.

333
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:12,160
Listen, Mr. Rachmaninoff does not appreciate us

334
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:14,320
swimming in his pool and listening to his classical music.

335
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:18,560
Listen, there's the ghost of Mr. Raghman Shah.

336
00:23:18,560 --> 00:23:24,880
It's gonna haunt that pool like in that one episode of Are You Afraid of the Dark?

337
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:25,920
And we all know how that happened.

338
00:23:25,920 --> 00:23:26,880
Oh, shit.

339
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:28,000
It's the scariest one too.

340
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,200
It's the fucking scariest one.

341
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:29,760
No, it's not.

342
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:31,360
The girl in the mirror is the scariest one.

343
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:32,560
Don't start.

344
00:23:32,560 --> 00:23:33,680
A dead body.

345
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:37,920
Can you find a dead body or maybe even like roadkill and just throw it in the pool?

346
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:39,840
Because that was going to solve your problems.

347
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:43,760
Or just put a big sign outside that says haunted.

348
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:49,440
I can visualize that.

349
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:50,240
Oh, shit.

350
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:52,400
Haunted pool.

351
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:54,000
Don't swim at your own risk.

352
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,080
And then there's a picture of Patrick Swayze.

353
00:23:56,080 --> 00:24:03,760
Are you saying Patrick Swayze is in the movie Ghost or because Patrick Swayze is dead?

354
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:04,880
Yeah, let's clarify.

355
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:06,720
No, Patrick Swayze from the movie Ghost.

356
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:07,360
Not just...

357
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:11,680
By the way, they started a Ghost musical on Broadway and I think it's kind of fucked up

358
00:24:11,680 --> 00:24:12,960
they didn't get Patrick Swayze.

359
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:15,120
I mean, he's right there.

360
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:17,280
All around you.

361
00:24:17,280 --> 00:24:17,920
Just.

362
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:18,160
Like...

363
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:19,840
Are you saying that...

364
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:20,080
Okay.

365
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:25,280
Are you saying that Patrick Swayze, now that he's dead, he occupies all the space?

366
00:24:25,280 --> 00:24:26,400
All of Broadway?

367
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:28,560
No, I'm saying he's a ghost now.

368
00:24:28,560 --> 00:24:29,760
So, like, he's even better.

369
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:32,160
Oh, so they could have cut back on the special effects.

370
00:24:32,160 --> 00:24:32,720
Exactly.

371
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:34,480
He could just manifest himself.

372
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:37,200
He's an even better fit for the role than he was before.

373
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:39,920
If such a thing is even possible.

374
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:40,800
He nailed it.

375
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:41,440
He nailed it.

376
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:43,200
I miss him.

377
00:24:43,920 --> 00:24:45,200
I feel bad about this goof.

378
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:50,640
When he was dying, do you think he was like, don't worry guys, I got this?

379
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:57,600
It was just like, super cool.

380
00:24:57,600 --> 00:25:01,360
Like, way over the top.

381
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:01,920
This is not...

382
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:03,280
I've been preparing for this my whole life.

383
00:25:03,280 --> 00:25:05,120
This is not my first time at the rodeo.

384
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:07,120
So, don't shed a tear.

385
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:09,920
I'll see you later at pottery class.

386
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:19,840
Like, don't even trip because I know my friend Vincent Chevelle is gonna come and teach me

387
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:20,880
all the tricks that I...

388
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:23,600
They may be different tricks, but he had my back before.

389
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:27,280
I have no reason to think that he won't again have my back.

390
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:30,480
You know who has really freaked out while all that was going on?

391
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:30,880
Who's that?

392
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:32,240
Whoopi Goldberg.

393
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:32,480
Yeah.

394
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:35,680
But for different reasons.

395
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:38,400
She's got a lot of her own shit going on.

396
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:40,160
Yeah, Whoopi's got a lot on her plate.

397
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:40,560
I don't know.

398
00:25:40,560 --> 00:25:41,920
She's got the view and...

399
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:46,320
She's got her talk show, doesn't she?

400
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:49,600
Doesn't she have a drive time Whoopi in the morning?

401
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:51,120
Isn't that a thing that she has?

402
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:54,960
Let's make Whoopi a radio show in the morning.

403
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:55,600
Make it Whoopi.

404
00:25:56,640 --> 00:26:00,960
No, actually making Whoopi is a sci-fi channel show about cloning Whoopi Goldberg.

405
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:03,680
And that I wish we could...

406
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:09,280
Man, my dream woman is color purple arrow Whoopi Goldberg times six.

407
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:10,080
Times six.

408
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:11,520
We're at science three.

409
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:13,440
What are we doing?

410
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:19,520
I wonder if the six Whoopi Goldberg was really stupid like Doug in Multiplicity.

411
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:20,560
I like in Multiplicity.

412
00:26:22,560 --> 00:26:26,160
Remember like five minutes before we started recording, we're like,

413
00:26:26,160 --> 00:26:29,760
all right, guys, we're going to make this show, this particular episode,

414
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:37,040
a lot more welcoming to newcomers by not talking about weird dumb shit for 10 minutes at a time.

415
00:26:37,040 --> 00:26:37,840
Okay, you're right.

416
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:38,880
Let's rein it in.

417
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:41,680
Let's be a little more practical.

418
00:26:41,680 --> 00:26:42,240
Okay.

419
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:47,040
I've recently started my first job out of university or college, if you prefer.

420
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:47,600
And I do.

421
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:50,960
And I'm finding it difficult to stay awake during meetings.

422
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:53,840
In any meeting that goes on for more than a half hour,

423
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:58,240
I find it difficult to focus and often start to nod off unless I'm constantly involved.

424
00:26:59,040 --> 00:27:03,440
Do you have any advice for me before someone notices and I get fired?

425
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:07,360
As I have at least one meeting a day and they often contain important information for my work,

426
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:08,880
this is becoming a real problem.

427
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:11,040
That's from Lethargic in London.

428
00:27:11,040 --> 00:27:12,960
And I have a solution.

429
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:13,840
Oh, no.

430
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:14,800
I think it's a home run.

431
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:15,840
Oh, God.

432
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:19,200
Keep in your office or cubicle or whatever.

433
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:20,320
This is going to be stupid.

434
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:22,880
No, a pair of really uncomfortable shoes.

435
00:27:23,920 --> 00:27:28,000
And before the meeting, change into these shoes that are either too tight

436
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:31,200
or they're just uncomfortable in some way.

437
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:33,600
And they will stop you from falling asleep during the meeting.

438
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:35,760
I can't.

439
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:42,480
That's not- is it- is it almost a- I don't know if it's like a bad idea.

440
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:44,000
No, it's brilliant, you guys.

441
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:45,520
I think it's an okay idea.

442
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:49,280
I would suggest, first off, try that.

443
00:27:49,280 --> 00:27:51,840
I guess it's not as plausible as anything.

444
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:53,920
Are you getting enough sleep?

445
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:56,720
Are you getting like your seven to eight hours?

446
00:27:56,720 --> 00:27:58,240
Because that's really key.

447
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:02,640
Also, I see lots of ads for five hour energy drinks.

448
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:05,760
People replacing their coffee with them, which grosses me out, but-

449
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:08,240
And you should get the five hour energy drink

450
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:11,520
because it keeps you awake for five hours because your stomach wants to die.

451
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:15,440
Yeah, it'll make you nauseous.

452
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:17,040
Are you not a five hour energy drink fan?

453
00:28:17,920 --> 00:28:21,040
No, I had one at Max Fun Con and it made me want to kill myself.

454
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:23,360
That's- you're probably- you're probably-

455
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:26,960
Well, I also have like the constitution of like a two year old, so.

456
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:27,280
Yeah.

457
00:28:27,280 --> 00:28:29,120
Yeah, you got that- all those tummy issues.

458
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:33,680
Can I- can I put forth one possible solution?

459
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:35,040
What's that?

460
00:28:35,040 --> 00:28:37,200
Just fucking go to sleep during the meeting.

461
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:41,200
Just slip on some shades and kick back.

462
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:45,360
If they can't- if they can't fucking turn their PowerPoint presentations

463
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:49,120
and do a rock you like a hurricane roller coaster,

464
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:51,600
then that's their fucking problem.

465
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:54,560
Like if they're putting you to sleep, then they need to know about it.

466
00:28:55,520 --> 00:28:55,760
Right.

467
00:28:55,760 --> 00:28:58,240
You know, a while back, do you remember we got that question where somebody was like,

468
00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:01,920
how do I like gain an affect- an affectation at work?

469
00:29:02,800 --> 00:29:04,320
Maybe you're the sleepy guy.

470
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:06,560
Oh, that's just sleepy Jim.

471
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:08,560
That's what he does.

472
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:12,400
People always say that, like this presentation we're doing is boring.

473
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:14,400
I'm worried we're going to put people to sleep.

474
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:16,960
Like you are creating actual metric.

475
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:17,440
Like-

476
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:19,280
You're the canary in the coal mine.

477
00:29:19,280 --> 00:29:20,960
Exactly, in the boring coal mine.

478
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:22,320
I'm- I'm asleep.

479
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:23,040
Spice it up.

480
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:25,200
Maybe that'll make people work harder.

481
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:25,680
Like they want to-

482
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:27,040
Maybe they start yelling that out.

483
00:29:27,040 --> 00:29:28,560
Like this is boring.

484
00:29:28,560 --> 00:29:29,360
Spice it up.

485
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:32,240
I'm going to sleep over here.

486
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:34,560
Do lights and- do lights and smoke and shit.

487
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:35,680
That's it.

488
00:29:35,680 --> 00:29:36,160
No.

489
00:29:36,160 --> 00:29:37,680
Tell a funny story about me.

490
00:29:37,680 --> 00:29:40,560
You don't need to tell them to do that to their presentations.

491
00:29:40,560 --> 00:29:41,920
You can do that for them.

492
00:29:41,920 --> 00:29:46,640
You can be the guy who like shows up to each presentation with a fucking boombox

493
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:52,480
and just start blasting Crazy Train as they're talking about, you know, their- their gross earnings.

494
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:53,040
Is that it?

495
00:29:53,040 --> 00:29:54,960
And then start spinning some glow sticks around.

496
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:57,840
The- the other thing you might try that's a little easier,

497
00:29:57,840 --> 00:30:00,000
that goes in line with Travis's shoe advice.

498
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:03,840
Maybe try like taking notes the whole time.

499
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:05,920
Like engaging yourself that way.

500
00:30:05,920 --> 00:30:07,920
Just because wouldn't- that way you're not passive.

501
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:13,440
And you- and you're- you're engaged even if it's not like you're not adding to it.

502
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:16,880
The other- the other option is you say you stay awake when you add to it.

503
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:18,960
Maybe just start adding to it a lot more.

504
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:20,080
I agree.

505
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:22,720
Maybe just dip in every 20 seconds or so.

506
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:24,240
Yeah, this is a great point.

507
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:25,520
That's what I was gonna say.

508
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:26,800
I was gonna say that earlier.

509
00:30:26,800 --> 00:30:27,120
You could-

510
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:28,000
I agree with you.

511
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:28,480
You can be like-

512
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:29,200
Well said.

513
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:34,640
Like a founding father in the- the first- the first congressional congress.

514
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:36,160
Is that what- is that what it was called when they-

515
00:30:36,160 --> 00:30:37,360
Yeah, Continental Congress.

516
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:40,800
First Continental Congress where they-

517
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:43,520
No, I think it was the first congressional congress.

518
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:44,560
It was the first- the first congress of congressional-

519
00:30:44,560 --> 00:30:46,400
The first senatorial senate.

520
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:48,400
And just like have a-

521
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:50,320
And the second presidential president.

522
00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:52,480
Of gubernatorial goobers meeting.

523
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:56,320
You gotta have like a cane that you can like bang on the table when somebody says something.

524
00:30:56,320 --> 00:30:58,880
And yell like, here, here.

525
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:01,200
Just like, someone open up a window.

526
00:31:01,920 --> 00:31:03,280
Harump, harump, harump.

527
00:31:03,280 --> 00:31:04,960
Sit down, Dan.

528
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:08,160
Sit down, Dan.

529
00:31:08,160 --> 00:31:10,240
I'm trying to do my PowerPoint.

530
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:12,720
Oh man, I hope-

531
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:14,080
And also Ben Franklin is there.

532
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:16,880
Yeah, also be- just be- just be Ben Franklin.

533
00:31:19,280 --> 00:31:19,440
No.

534
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:23,120
No, there's nothing actionable in that thing I just said.

535
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:23,360
No.

536
00:31:23,920 --> 00:31:27,920
I just kind of wanted a picture of Ben Franklin in a room going, play Crazy Train.

537
00:31:27,920 --> 00:31:28,560
Yeah.

538
00:31:28,560 --> 00:31:29,040
Do it.

539
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:35,360
The problem is that we really can't address questions this boring anymore.

540
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:39,040
You're making us bored with your boring shit.

541
00:31:39,040 --> 00:31:42,400
There's a reason none of us work in offices, and it's this very reason.

542
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:43,440
Yeah, right.

543
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:45,360
30 seconds or less, I'd be asleep.

544
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:46,960
Here's the solution I went with.

545
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:47,680
Don't go back.

546
00:31:47,680 --> 00:31:48,180
Yeah.

547
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:50,320
Stop going to work.

548
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:50,880
Stop going.

549
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:52,000
You know what?

550
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:52,880
Live like you're dying.

551
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:54,240
Just fucking go to sleep.

552
00:31:54,800 --> 00:31:55,440
So what?

553
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:56,720
Office space, this is hell.

554
00:31:56,720 --> 00:31:57,600
Don't even hide it.

555
00:31:57,600 --> 00:32:03,760
Pull a pillow out of your briefcase, fluff it, put it on the table, spin around three times,

556
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:05,360
and go take a snooze.

557
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:09,840
I wonder if there's a whole generation of people who saw office space and just said,

558
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:10,720
eh, fuck it.

559
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:14,480
And that's why we have such a high unemployment rate.

560
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:17,920
Hmm, but then there's also a generation of people who watch the office and it's like,

561
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:19,200
but these people are my best friends.

562
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:20,320
I'm going to find true love here.

563
00:32:22,800 --> 00:32:24,400
This is going to be so zany.

564
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:26,000
You're not though, and it's not.

565
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:26,800
It's going to be boring.

566
00:32:26,800 --> 00:32:27,120
It's not.

567
00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:28,960
You're just going to fucking sleep all the time.

568
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:31,200
God, work is awful.

569
00:32:32,160 --> 00:32:33,360
Go work on the internet.

570
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:34,640
I sleep at home all the time.

571
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:35,280
Nobody knows.

572
00:32:35,280 --> 00:32:44,160
You know, you know, if you want to work on the internet, then you got to make money in the money zone.

573
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:56,480
What the fuck are you doing?

574
00:32:56,480 --> 00:32:57,360
Was that good?

575
00:32:57,360 --> 00:33:00,240
I just, I saw, I saw an opening and I took it.

576
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:01,760
The fuck do you think you're doing?

577
00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:03,680
I'm angling for your job, McRoy.

578
00:33:03,680 --> 00:33:05,680
Hey guys, here's some sad libs for you.

579
00:33:05,680 --> 00:33:06,720
Blah, blah, blah, blah.

580
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:07,600
No Griffin, no.

581
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:09,280
Fart giraffes.

582
00:33:11,280 --> 00:33:12,160
Wait, fart giraffes.

583
00:33:12,160 --> 00:33:12,640
I like this.

584
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:13,840
I like this vein.

585
00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:14,720
Let's tap into it.

586
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:19,440
This message is for Russell and Laura from Nathan.

587
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:22,800
Congrats to Russell and Laura on getting hitched this weekend.

588
00:33:23,520 --> 00:33:27,360
Russ is a rad photographer and Laura is just flat out rad.

589
00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:32,640
And they're both going out and getting it in 20 does like champions.

590
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:37,840
They are getting, well actually they would have gotten married last weekend, I guess.

591
00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:39,920
So congratulations to you guys.

592
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:44,000
Congratulation on your first week of rad marriage.

593
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:45,440
I hope you're still together.

594
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:49,840
Do you think they came down the aisle on like skateboards or like maybe he was on a razor

595
00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:54,160
scooter and maybe they like got up to the creature and they just like flipped him off

596
00:33:54,160 --> 00:33:55,040
and they're like, fuck you.

597
00:33:55,040 --> 00:33:56,400
We don't need your institution.

598
00:33:57,840 --> 00:34:01,680
And then they kissed like real deep.

599
00:34:01,680 --> 00:34:03,120
And gross, right?

600
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:05,600
Gross, you know, and he's like, sorry, granny.

601
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:08,400
And then they're like spray painted on somebody in the front row.

602
00:34:08,400 --> 00:34:08,960
Yeah.

603
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:14,320
And and then and then they signed the marriage papers.

604
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:16,080
No, that's not rad.

605
00:34:16,080 --> 00:34:19,760
But what if the no, but they signed it with like a big dildo shaped pen.

606
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:28,480
OK, what if they they cut into their wedding pizza and she fed him a slice, hot slice of

607
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:29,520
wedding pizza?

608
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:34,000
Because that's and then smashed it on his face and then burned him because the oil was

609
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:34,320
really.

610
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:35,520
Yeah, yeah.

611
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:39,040
Guys, this podcast is supported by Microsoft's being a new way to search.

612
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:42,720
Use being to search the web and your own social media networks with the new social search

613
00:34:42,720 --> 00:34:46,720
sidebar, allowing you to ask your friends as well as the experts tried online at Bing

614
00:34:46,720 --> 00:34:47,520
Dotcom.

615
00:34:48,160 --> 00:34:50,400
Bing is for doing like experts like us.

616
00:34:51,120 --> 00:34:53,440
No, like actual real experts.

617
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:54,480
There are real experts.

618
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:55,840
Why do people keep asking us questions?

619
00:34:55,840 --> 00:35:00,960
We have to be experts in something by this point, don't we?

620
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:04,400
Like accidentally even how to get fired.

621
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:09,840
I think we we probably have more diverse and illegal methods of getting fire than anybody.

622
00:35:09,840 --> 00:35:11,280
How to make your dad cringe.

623
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:13,680
OK, how to make your nanny cry.

624
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:18,000
If that's a category of expertise, that's easy, though, like pussy.

625
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:21,600
Well, now everyone's uncomfortable.

626
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:24,400
Let's do Yahoo.

627
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:29,600
This this one was sent in by Lisa Holofield and like four other people.

628
00:35:29,600 --> 00:35:33,520
I got this from a lot of sources, so it promises to be pretty good.

629
00:35:33,520 --> 00:35:36,800
It's by Yahoo Answers user unerring pair who asks.

630
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:42,560
If I shave my golden retriever like a lion, will the other dogs respect him more?

631
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:46,400
Because he's kind of the neighborhood loser.

632
00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:50,880
Oh, no, that's it.

633
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:53,200
It went from being kind of funny to kind of.

634
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:57,600
How you're superimposing a lot of hierarchy on the dogs.

635
00:35:58,640 --> 00:36:02,640
Yeah, first of all, lion is king of the cats.

636
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:06,240
Totally different, totally different thing.

637
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:09,520
Like their archenemy, basically.

638
00:36:09,520 --> 00:36:12,480
Yeah, that's like saying I'm going to dress him up like Mumra.

639
00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:14,640
So so he can hang with his buddies.

640
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:17,440
The Thunder Cat's like, no, that's going to make him really sad.

641
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:18,880
They're going to hate it.

642
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:23,600
I'm going to dress them up like Rufio saying hang out with all Hook's Pirates.

643
00:36:23,600 --> 00:36:24,320
Oh, God.

644
00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:25,040
It's like saying.

645
00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:25,920
Anybody else?

646
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:26,960
Yeah, yeah.

647
00:36:27,680 --> 00:36:28,640
What do you got, Griffin?

648
00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:29,520
You got something?

649
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:30,160
I'm trying to think.

650
00:36:30,160 --> 00:36:31,120
Let me think of two.

651
00:36:31,120 --> 00:36:34,880
I went to I went to Nazis like instantly and there's nothing there that's going to be.

652
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:36,160
Churchill?

653
00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:38,480
Yeah, that it's like dressing up like Churchill.

654
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:41,680
And then he used to hang out with the Nazis.

655
00:36:41,680 --> 00:36:44,240
I would love to see a dog dressed up like Churchill.

656
00:36:44,240 --> 00:36:44,960
Oh, my God.

657
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:46,160
Photos, please.

658
00:36:46,160 --> 00:36:50,080
Please somebody dress up your fat ass dog like Winston Churchill.

659
00:36:50,080 --> 00:36:51,200
I bet you anything.

660
00:36:52,240 --> 00:36:53,920
I am Googling right now.

661
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:57,680
Dog dressed like be Winston.

662
00:36:57,680 --> 00:37:00,080
Dog dressed like be be dogs.

663
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:03,520
OK, Google, Google be dogs.

664
00:37:03,520 --> 00:37:04,640
I'm not Googling be dog.

665
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:07,040
Oh, yes.

666
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:11,040
I see a dog with glasses who looks like Churchill.

667
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:14,480
Everybody, I'm sorry.

668
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:15,920
A picture of a bulldog.

669
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:16,960
You know it's a bulldog.

670
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:23,520
Everybody, if you can send make more pictures of your dog dressed like Churchill.

671
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:27,680
I I do insist on historical accuracy.

672
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:31,200
I'll try to put the picture I found in the form.

673
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:33,920
It also looks like Kathy Bates in that new lawyer show.

674
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:39,280
It's adorable.

675
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:43,840
Do you mean the new adventures of old Christine?

676
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:47,520
I also would like to point out that in dog,

677
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:49,680
like there is a certain amount like the dominance,

678
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:51,600
you know, alpha male kind of thing,

679
00:37:51,600 --> 00:37:53,600
but it doesn't rank down.

680
00:37:53,600 --> 00:37:56,000
It's like I'm alpha male.

681
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:57,680
So you're second and you're third.

682
00:37:57,680 --> 00:38:00,000
Yeah, you're the epsilon male.

683
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:01,200
Get out of here, pussy.

684
00:38:01,840 --> 00:38:03,120
It's not really how it works.

685
00:38:03,120 --> 00:38:07,200
There's mostly just like with the one guy on top and then everybody else.

686
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:10,560
Also, I don't think I mean a lion looks like a lion

687
00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:12,960
because he's got the frame to support that main.

688
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:14,880
Does your frame support your main?

689
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:16,640
That's the that's the real question,

690
00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:18,080
because this golden retriever,

691
00:38:18,080 --> 00:38:20,080
I think if you slap a lion on him,

692
00:38:20,080 --> 00:38:22,240
I think he's going to look pretty goddamn goofy.

693
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:26,480
He's going to look like a shaved dog with a giant poof on his head

694
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:29,520
and he's going to probably get murdered by the other.

695
00:38:29,520 --> 00:38:31,840
Yeah, it's going to look like he's wearing mink

696
00:38:31,840 --> 00:38:34,080
and it's not going to be a good look for him, respect wise.

697
00:38:34,080 --> 00:38:36,880
Why are you getting so hung up on your dog's appearance?

698
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:41,120
I don't know if you've read T.L. Carnegie's How to Win Friends and Influence People,

699
00:38:41,120 --> 00:38:45,520
but the key thing is for your dog to get interested in the other dogs.

700
00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:47,360
Is he sniffing their butts?

701
00:38:47,360 --> 00:38:48,720
Is he sniffing their butts enough?

702
00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:51,840
He's got to get interested in the smell of their butts.

703
00:38:51,840 --> 00:38:53,280
What's his hump game like?

704
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:58,080
Is he is he letting himself be humped more than he's trying to hump the other dog?

705
00:38:58,080 --> 00:38:59,280
That's a great question, Justin.

706
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:03,040
That's so key in society.

707
00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:06,320
Also, maybe your dog's just boring.

708
00:39:06,320 --> 00:39:08,160
Maybe your dog just fucking sucks.

709
00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:10,480
Some dog has to suck.

710
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:12,800
There has to be a most boring dog in any pack.

711
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:13,840
Is he wearing glasses?

712
00:39:13,840 --> 00:39:14,240
Asshole.

713
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:16,240
Nice glasses, dipshit.

714
00:39:16,240 --> 00:39:17,440
Nice glasses, Churchill.

715
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:18,960
Nice glasses, Churchill.

716
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:19,840
Get your kettle.

717
00:39:19,840 --> 00:39:22,160
Why do all the other dogs always pick on Churchill?

718
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:27,440
You know, we bought him really nice Randy Jackson frames.

719
00:39:29,040 --> 00:39:29,600
I don't know.

720
00:39:29,600 --> 00:39:32,160
I'm just as sweet as doggy pipe.

721
00:39:32,160 --> 00:39:33,600
He's got a great doggy pipe.

722
00:39:33,600 --> 00:39:36,880
Was that a negative comment about my glasses?

723
00:39:37,600 --> 00:39:38,160
No.

724
00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:38,800
No.

725
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:42,400
I just think your glasses are super stylish.

726
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:46,960
I am just constantly entertained by the fact that they were handcrafted by Randy Jackson.

727
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:48,880
By the artisanal Randy Jackson.

728
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:49,840
Yo, dog.

729
00:39:49,840 --> 00:39:56,080
I'm making you some artisanal glasses frames in my day off from working with Gloria Estefan.

730
00:39:56,080 --> 00:39:57,520
Working on her new CD.

731
00:39:57,520 --> 00:39:58,880
That's going to drop next week.

732
00:39:58,880 --> 00:40:01,760
And then the week after that, I'm going to drop Griffin's glasses off.

733
00:40:02,640 --> 00:40:04,560
And then I have to fix them because I dropped them.

734
00:40:04,560 --> 00:40:06,480
And then I'm going to fix them because I dropped them.

735
00:40:07,840 --> 00:40:10,560
Recently, the Just for Laughs festival came to Chicago.

736
00:40:11,120 --> 00:40:15,920
And with it brought basically all my favorite comedians from big names to lesser known

737
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:17,920
slash soon to be big names.

738
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:21,440
Saw them all over the place, waiting across the street, walking around Walgreens.

739
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:27,040
So my question is, what is the proper etiquette for meeting comedians or celebrities?

740
00:40:27,040 --> 00:40:28,800
And that's from our buddy Justin Russo.

741
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:31,840
Justin, before I answer your question, I was hoping you could provide me with some more

742
00:40:31,840 --> 00:40:33,120
things that people do in a city.

743
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:35,520
Riding the bus.

744
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:36,560
Reading a book.

745
00:40:36,560 --> 00:40:37,760
Reading a book.

746
00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:38,560
Sitting on benches.

747
00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:38,960
Eating.

748
00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:39,760
Getting mugged.

749
00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:40,480
Paying bills.

750
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:43,760
I saw Bobcat Goldthwait getting mugged.

751
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:45,040
Picking up prescriptions.

752
00:40:45,040 --> 00:40:45,920
Using a bathroom.

753
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:50,000
Crying quietly on a bench.

754
00:40:51,040 --> 00:40:52,560
Wondering where they all went wrong.

755
00:40:52,560 --> 00:40:54,160
Wondering when their big break is coming.

756
00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:59,760
There are several schools of thought here.

757
00:41:00,560 --> 00:41:05,200
Let's give our, let's each give our own person.

758
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:09,440
Normally we, I think we try to come to a consensus.

759
00:41:09,440 --> 00:41:14,240
I say on this question, we divide and conquer and each give our own personal strategies.

760
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:14,960
I'll start.

761
00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:15,200
Okay.

762
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:17,120
Don't.

763
00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:20,000
Just don't.

764
00:41:21,040 --> 00:41:22,240
Don't acknowledge them.

765
00:41:22,240 --> 00:41:28,240
Pretend you're a stranger and they're a stranger because that's the arrangement and never introduce

766
00:41:28,240 --> 00:41:30,480
yourself to them ever because that's what I do.

767
00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:31,600
That's my jam.

768
00:41:31,600 --> 00:41:34,080
That's now let me counterpoint with this.

769
00:41:34,880 --> 00:41:35,440
Do.

770
00:41:35,440 --> 00:41:35,840
Okay.

771
00:41:36,640 --> 00:41:37,520
Because.

772
00:41:37,520 --> 00:41:40,800
Well, but you have to give, you can't just say, just do this thing.

773
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:43,520
You have to, you have to give it some sort of action.

774
00:41:43,520 --> 00:41:49,920
I think that, okay, so this might be my way of looking at it and I might be a little over optimistic

775
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:54,640
here, but these people, you know, you get famous, you get popular because people like you.

776
00:41:54,640 --> 00:41:58,400
So you're supported by your fans and they want to know, you know, that people like them.

777
00:41:58,400 --> 00:42:03,600
That's what I always tell myself to justify going out to them and saying like, Hey, Gallagher,

778
00:42:03,600 --> 00:42:04,640
I'm a huge fan.

779
00:42:04,640 --> 00:42:06,800
Thank you so much for all the laughs and walking away.

780
00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:10,880
What you don't want to do is totally geek out and think that you in some way are going

781
00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:14,480
to make a lasting impression and become best friends with this person.

782
00:42:14,480 --> 00:42:18,320
This is your chance to like bump into them, say, Hey, thanks so much for doing all the

783
00:42:18,320 --> 00:42:21,120
great work, shaking their hand and getting away.

784
00:42:21,120 --> 00:42:24,400
See, I thought you were going to go a different direction and say that like these people live

785
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:31,120
such crazy superficial lives that they just, they really want that human contact.

786
00:42:31,120 --> 00:42:34,000
And you've got it, you've got it to give to them.

787
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:37,920
You know, I used to tell myself that all these people want is for somebody to come up and

788
00:42:37,920 --> 00:42:40,640
be cool and not super nerdy and geeky out.

789
00:42:40,640 --> 00:42:43,280
And they'll be like, Hey, Travis, you're actually real cool.

790
00:42:43,280 --> 00:42:46,800
Let's hang out back at my palatial comedian estate.

791
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:49,040
Yeah, but that is not how it works.

792
00:42:49,040 --> 00:42:50,640
They, they're, they want to be left alone.

793
00:42:50,640 --> 00:42:51,360
They don't know you.

794
00:42:51,360 --> 00:42:53,360
So say like, Hey, thank you so much.

795
00:42:53,360 --> 00:42:54,560
Take the opportunity.

796
00:42:54,560 --> 00:42:56,080
Like that's what I say.

797
00:42:56,080 --> 00:42:59,680
When's the chance that you're going to see these people again, you know, take the opportunity

798
00:42:59,680 --> 00:43:01,200
to say, Hey, I'm a big fan.

799
00:43:01,200 --> 00:43:02,320
Thank you so much.

800
00:43:02,320 --> 00:43:09,520
I am as someone who is occasionally recognized in extremely limited and specific.

801
00:43:09,520 --> 00:43:19,280
When you go to conventions, right near or around a sign that has my name on it.

802
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:25,120
I am occasionally recognized and I can tell you it always makes me feel good.

803
00:43:26,480 --> 00:43:30,560
So if you have that, like as sort of your, now you would think that that would convince

804
00:43:30,560 --> 00:43:35,760
me that maybe people who are actually famous, that maybe they feel the same way.

805
00:43:35,760 --> 00:43:41,200
Hey, but I, I, I just can't, I don't know what to say.

806
00:43:41,200 --> 00:43:43,040
You know, it's, I don't know what to do.

807
00:43:43,040 --> 00:43:45,040
I will say this is Griffin.

808
00:43:45,040 --> 00:43:45,520
What do you do?

809
00:43:46,080 --> 00:43:46,720
Oh, thanks.

810
00:43:47,840 --> 00:43:52,800
What I like to do is I will stand near them.

811
00:43:56,640 --> 00:43:59,360
That's really just stand near them and you don't really have to.

812
00:44:00,800 --> 00:44:02,560
And like, wait for them to recognize you.

813
00:44:02,560 --> 00:44:03,760
No, they don't even need to.

814
00:44:03,760 --> 00:44:05,840
I don't, I don't require that recognition.

815
00:44:05,840 --> 00:44:10,320
I'm just saying, if you stand close enough to somebody, they got to talk to you eventually.

816
00:44:10,320 --> 00:44:14,320
Like, even if they have to, even if they're not a celeb, even if you're just like at the

817
00:44:14,320 --> 00:44:17,520
bus stop, someone's going to that, that will also applies to celebs.

818
00:44:17,520 --> 00:44:22,960
So then you, you put the ball in their court, they start talking to you and then you insult

819
00:44:22,960 --> 00:44:23,680
them a little bit.

820
00:44:25,520 --> 00:44:30,880
Just like insult them a little bit, but then give them and then you give them some attention.

821
00:44:30,880 --> 00:44:35,280
And then before you know it, you're in your fucking Bobcat.

822
00:44:36,880 --> 00:44:38,320
I, I can't.

823
00:44:39,440 --> 00:44:43,120
I'm saying, I'm saying you don't settle for just meeting a celebrity.

824
00:44:44,320 --> 00:44:44,640
Right.

825
00:44:44,640 --> 00:44:45,360
Make a connection.

826
00:44:45,360 --> 00:44:45,840
Fuck them.

827
00:44:46,800 --> 00:44:47,600
Fuck them.

828
00:44:47,600 --> 00:44:48,880
What's a better story?

829
00:44:48,880 --> 00:44:53,200
I was at the Costco and I ran into Bobcat Coldthwaite.

830
00:44:53,200 --> 00:45:06,400
And I ran into, into corn cob gold bars and at the Costco in the, in the chicken, in the

831
00:45:06,400 --> 00:45:07,600
chicken trough.

832
00:45:07,600 --> 00:45:11,280
And before you knew it, we were back at my bungalow.

833
00:45:11,280 --> 00:45:15,120
Fucking, I fucked corn cob gold gong.

834
00:45:15,120 --> 00:45:17,520
And it turned out he was just a homeless man.

835
00:45:17,520 --> 00:45:19,200
I'm corn cob gold gong.

836
00:45:19,200 --> 00:45:26,240
I was at the Zappa's distribution center and I ran into Flapjack Nicholsack and we made

837
00:45:26,240 --> 00:45:28,480
love, we made love all night long.

838
00:45:28,480 --> 00:45:31,360
And I don't know who he is, but he acted like he was somebody.

839
00:45:31,360 --> 00:45:32,480
So I figured he must've been.

840
00:45:32,480 --> 00:45:33,840
Oh man.

841
00:45:33,840 --> 00:45:36,320
And he kept insisting I take pictures with him.

842
00:45:36,960 --> 00:45:42,480
The one thing I have to ask you, and though I have been occasionally, as I said, recognized,

843
00:45:44,480 --> 00:45:47,920
I've also been around legitimately famous people when this has happened.

844
00:45:47,920 --> 00:45:50,320
And I have to beg of you, don't let it happen to you.

845
00:45:51,040 --> 00:45:55,760
Please, if you're going to introduce yourself to someone, please know who the fuck they

846
00:45:55,760 --> 00:45:56,480
are.

847
00:45:56,480 --> 00:46:02,080
Don't just have a vague awareness that they are someone and try to suss it out.

848
00:46:02,080 --> 00:46:03,120
Aren't you somebody?

849
00:46:03,120 --> 00:46:04,720
What have I seen you in?

850
00:46:04,720 --> 00:46:09,280
A lot of times people will call me Travis or Griffin, which must be mortifying for them.

851
00:46:09,280 --> 00:46:13,920
But I, I pretty, after like 20 years with you guys, I'm pretty used to it from like

852
00:46:13,920 --> 00:46:15,120
our parents, friends and stuff.

853
00:46:15,120 --> 00:46:16,640
So it didn't really bother me.

854
00:46:16,640 --> 00:46:21,600
But like, please, if you're going to introduce yourself to an actual celebrity, know who

855
00:46:21,600 --> 00:46:22,240
they are.

856
00:46:22,240 --> 00:46:27,760
Cause that, cause that's pretty brutal that like, you know, you have some relevance to

857
00:46:27,760 --> 00:46:31,280
society, but people can't even like, it's not even like solidifying.

858
00:46:31,280 --> 00:46:32,320
You have fame.

859
00:46:32,320 --> 00:46:34,400
Let me wheeze your juice for a second.

860
00:46:34,400 --> 00:46:35,360
Let me stand near you.

861
00:46:35,360 --> 00:46:36,480
Are you a fame person?

862
00:46:36,480 --> 00:46:39,200
Yeah, you're, you're rare and exotic.

863
00:46:40,240 --> 00:46:41,120
You look like somebody.

864
00:46:41,120 --> 00:46:43,360
Can I touch your hand and tell all my friends about it?

865
00:46:43,360 --> 00:46:46,800
Let's, and then go home and Google you and try to figure out who you are.

866
00:46:46,800 --> 00:46:54,000
When we were at, when we were at max fun con, I had a lot of, uh, post panic attacks where

867
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:58,080
I would be talking to someone whose work I know, but I don't necessarily know their

868
00:46:58,080 --> 00:47:06,480
visage and like right after the conversation or interaction had ended, um, uh, I would

869
00:47:06,480 --> 00:47:10,080
realize, or someone would tell me like, Hey, that's this person that did this thing that

870
00:47:10,080 --> 00:47:13,920
did this thing that is great that you like and lots of people like, and I would kind

871
00:47:13,920 --> 00:47:16,000
of hyperventilate a little bit, but then you know what?

872
00:47:16,960 --> 00:47:21,600
I would just get angry because where do they get off acting like a regular person?

873
00:47:21,600 --> 00:47:22,320
Yeah.

874
00:47:22,320 --> 00:47:25,440
Why do they not introduce themselves and say, no, don't freak out.

875
00:47:25,440 --> 00:47:29,360
If that right now, listen, don't panic, but I'm going to put my shades on.

876
00:47:32,880 --> 00:47:34,000
Features so bright.

877
00:47:34,800 --> 00:47:38,960
Like if someone's not, I don't think you're famous unless you put on giant sunglasses

878
00:47:38,960 --> 00:47:44,560
and go, Oh yeah, is that important?

879
00:47:44,560 --> 00:47:48,320
So basically you're saying like the only famous person, he was Matthew Rod, right?

880
00:47:48,320 --> 00:47:48,560
Right.

881
00:47:48,560 --> 00:47:49,920
He's the only famous person.

882
00:47:49,920 --> 00:47:51,600
You have a really specific metric.

883
00:47:51,600 --> 00:47:53,360
He's not aging well.

884
00:47:53,360 --> 00:47:56,560
I saw him on the Tony's and he looked terrified.

885
00:47:56,560 --> 00:47:58,480
He looks, he always looks so scared.

886
00:48:00,480 --> 00:48:01,680
What am I doing up here?

887
00:48:02,480 --> 00:48:02,720
Yeah.

888
00:48:02,720 --> 00:48:04,640
I don't mean to say he's not aging well.

889
00:48:04,640 --> 00:48:08,880
I just think like the boyish thing is just like, I don't know.

890
00:48:08,880 --> 00:48:13,360
You expect you to like, Oh, he looks like it's hard for me to shake that image of him

891
00:48:13,360 --> 00:48:14,080
as boyish.

892
00:48:14,080 --> 00:48:16,000
I guess it's hard for him to shake that too.

893
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:16,240
Right?

894
00:48:16,240 --> 00:48:20,000
Like he's got the story of Bradley Whitford's got the same thing going a little bit where

895
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:23,760
he still looks like a little boy, but he looks like an old boy.

896
00:48:23,760 --> 00:48:26,480
He looks like a kind of like an old boy.

897
00:48:26,480 --> 00:48:30,160
He looks like a boy who is like a super, like a 70 year old boy.

898
00:48:31,600 --> 00:48:32,480
It's not great.

899
00:48:32,480 --> 00:48:33,360
It's not great for him.

900
00:48:34,160 --> 00:48:34,880
I love his work.

901
00:48:34,880 --> 00:48:35,760
Love his work though.

902
00:48:35,760 --> 00:48:36,080
Oh wait.

903
00:48:36,080 --> 00:48:39,280
Are we talking about if you see, if you see your Matthew Broderick or Bradley Whitford,

904
00:48:39,280 --> 00:48:42,480
please do not tell them that we said these terrible things about him.

905
00:48:42,480 --> 00:48:45,920
I loved Matthew Broderick in old boy, the Japanese horror movie.

906
00:48:47,360 --> 00:48:49,280
I love Bradley Whitford in old dogs.

907
00:48:50,640 --> 00:48:51,680
I, I would give in.

908
00:48:51,680 --> 00:48:52,640
Was he in that?

909
00:48:52,640 --> 00:48:53,600
Cause I could buy that.

910
00:48:54,400 --> 00:48:56,560
No, but he, well, I love the man.

911
00:48:56,560 --> 00:48:59,040
He, he, he, he will dip into some bad things.

912
00:48:59,600 --> 00:49:03,280
I love Bradley Whitford when I saw him in the premiere of old dogs.

913
00:49:03,280 --> 00:49:04,880
He was just watching the movie, but he was.

914
00:49:04,880 --> 00:49:10,160
Did I ever tell you guys, did I ever tell you guys about the time that I fucked Matthew Broderick?

915
00:49:12,080 --> 00:49:14,240
No, no.

916
00:49:15,040 --> 00:49:16,480
Somebody just made that their ringtone.

917
00:49:20,160 --> 00:49:24,880
And look on the iTunes Apple store for ringtones for my brother, my brother and me.

918
00:49:24,880 --> 00:49:30,080
If you, if your phone doesn't ring with my brother, my brother and me, then don't.

919
00:49:30,080 --> 00:49:32,720
Not if people know you want to fuck Matthew Broderick.

920
00:49:32,720 --> 00:49:36,480
You can either shake Matthew Broderick's hand and tell him you love Godzilla 2000.

921
00:49:36,480 --> 00:49:38,560
Or you can fuck him like Godzilla.

922
00:49:43,920 --> 00:49:44,880
Oh my God.

923
00:49:45,920 --> 00:49:49,680
The one person I don't want to piss off is Sarah Jessica Parker though.

924
00:49:49,680 --> 00:49:56,720
She will come at you and she'll break all this, the SITC girls and they will fuck you up.

925
00:49:56,720 --> 00:49:58,720
Throw you in a cauldron, turn you into soup.

926
00:49:59,440 --> 00:50:00,480
On a completely different note.

927
00:50:00,480 --> 00:50:04,320
I want to tell you guys a story that I was reminded of the other day being 14

928
00:50:04,960 --> 00:50:08,240
and seeing on TV that a show called Sex and the City was coming on.

929
00:50:08,240 --> 00:50:08,800
Yeah.

930
00:50:08,800 --> 00:50:09,920
Getting so excited.

931
00:50:09,920 --> 00:50:10,640
Here we go.

932
00:50:10,640 --> 00:50:11,360
Yeah.

933
00:50:11,360 --> 00:50:13,280
I'm going to sneak and watch this.

934
00:50:13,280 --> 00:50:14,320
Watch like 10 minutes.

935
00:50:14,320 --> 00:50:15,920
I was like, this is bullshit.

936
00:50:15,920 --> 00:50:18,000
Get ready to turn into a boner penis.

937
00:50:21,440 --> 00:50:23,920
To emerge butterfly like.

938
00:50:23,920 --> 00:50:25,840
Prepare autobots roll out.

939
00:50:25,840 --> 00:50:29,040
Roll out, time to transform.

940
00:50:30,640 --> 00:50:32,320
Voltron connect.

941
00:50:32,320 --> 00:50:34,480
Wonder Twins activate.

942
00:50:34,480 --> 00:50:35,520
Form a boner.

943
00:50:36,240 --> 00:50:37,920
GI Joe, get them.

944
00:50:39,040 --> 00:50:40,560
I don't remember what they said.

945
00:50:40,560 --> 00:50:43,040
I used to get that way for suddenly Susan.

946
00:50:48,480 --> 00:50:50,080
I used to, hold on, let me, can I try that joke?

947
00:50:50,080 --> 00:50:51,840
Can I do another take on that riff?

948
00:50:51,840 --> 00:50:52,720
Do another take on that joke.

949
00:50:52,720 --> 00:50:58,880
I used to get that way for designing women.

950
00:50:58,880 --> 00:51:00,720
That was the original title for Weird Science.

951
00:51:00,720 --> 00:51:01,360
Did you know that?

952
00:51:03,360 --> 00:51:06,800
It's just called why oh why do I get boners for designing women?

953
00:51:09,520 --> 00:51:10,720
Starring Vanessa Angel.

954
00:51:10,720 --> 00:51:11,280
Stop.

955
00:51:11,280 --> 00:51:14,160
I used to get that way for golden girls, but I'm fucking gross.

956
00:51:14,160 --> 00:51:14,320
Yeah.

957
00:51:15,600 --> 00:51:16,640
Hey, I need some advice.

958
00:51:17,280 --> 00:51:21,760
I've been seeing an amazing girl for a few weeks and it's been going really well.

959
00:51:21,760 --> 00:51:26,800
But I saw the inside of her house for the first time yet, and she's a hoarder.

960
00:51:28,320 --> 00:51:32,400
It's not as bad as the people on television yet, but the entire floor and every surface

961
00:51:32,400 --> 00:51:35,360
were completely covered with books, papers, and other random junk.

962
00:51:36,320 --> 00:51:40,400
Should I break up with her because of the hoarding or keep seeing her and hope it gets better?

963
00:51:41,680 --> 00:51:42,480
Oh my God.

964
00:51:43,760 --> 00:51:45,440
That's a tough question.

965
00:51:45,440 --> 00:51:46,640
This is like a real one.

966
00:51:46,640 --> 00:51:48,320
I'm not even sure we should answer this.

967
00:51:48,320 --> 00:51:49,520
Well, I'm going to say this.

968
00:51:49,520 --> 00:51:53,600
I know this from my brief foray into psychological studies.

969
00:51:53,600 --> 00:51:55,120
It doesn't just get better.

970
00:51:55,760 --> 00:51:58,640
She's not going to sit there one day and be like, oh, my shit's messy.

971
00:51:58,640 --> 00:51:59,760
Well, it's messy in here.

972
00:51:59,760 --> 00:52:00,160
I'm going to clean up.

973
00:52:00,160 --> 00:52:02,560
Isn't that what the whole hook of the TV show Hoarders is?

974
00:52:02,560 --> 00:52:03,840
They take hoarders and they fix them?

975
00:52:04,720 --> 00:52:07,280
They fix them, but it's not a spontaneous thing.

976
00:52:07,920 --> 00:52:08,560
You know what?

977
00:52:08,560 --> 00:52:09,920
I should pick up around here.

978
00:52:10,720 --> 00:52:11,040
No.

979
00:52:11,040 --> 00:52:16,960
And they, but they, and it's all most of the time, it's like a, it's a short term fix.

980
00:52:16,960 --> 00:52:20,000
They clean up and then they're like, we visited three weeks later

981
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:21,760
and Phillip is still a dirty fuck.

982
00:52:24,080 --> 00:52:27,360
They're still just dry ramen noodles everywhere.

983
00:52:27,360 --> 00:52:30,880
I've never seen Hoarders, but I assume it primarily is about ramen noodles.

984
00:52:30,880 --> 00:52:34,720
Guys, I understand that that is a real psychological disorder.

985
00:52:34,720 --> 00:52:35,760
I get it.

986
00:52:35,760 --> 00:52:42,080
It is just so hard for me to watch and not just scream like just clean, just clean up.

987
00:52:42,080 --> 00:52:42,800
I love to clean.

988
00:52:42,800 --> 00:52:43,760
I'll clean for you.

989
00:52:43,760 --> 00:52:44,880
Let me clean your house.

990
00:52:44,880 --> 00:52:46,320
I'm a pretty messy person.

991
00:52:46,320 --> 00:52:52,400
But the idea of like not being able to see from one side of my house to the other,

992
00:52:52,400 --> 00:52:57,520
like not being able to walk across the floor without like stepping over piles of newspaper

993
00:52:57,520 --> 00:53:00,160
and stuff, it just skews me how, yeah.

994
00:53:00,160 --> 00:53:02,240
In a legitimate answer to your question,

995
00:53:05,440 --> 00:53:12,080
you have to decide that this girl is, whether or not the possibility of this relationship

996
00:53:12,080 --> 00:53:12,640
is worth it.

997
00:53:12,640 --> 00:53:13,040
Yeah.

998
00:53:13,040 --> 00:53:19,280
Like you, there is every chance that maybe you could help her with this problem.

999
00:53:19,280 --> 00:53:25,040
Like maybe that's all she needs is somebody to emotionally support her and help prop her

1000
00:53:25,040 --> 00:53:26,560
up and help get her through it.

1001
00:53:26,560 --> 00:53:35,120
But if you go into this with eyes open, you are accepting the possibility that it might

1002
00:53:35,120 --> 00:53:35,840
never get better.

1003
00:53:35,840 --> 00:53:39,600
It might get wicked worse and you may be committing to a life this way.

1004
00:53:39,600 --> 00:53:46,800
And I think that honestly, you are completely within your rights ethically and emotionally

1005
00:53:46,800 --> 00:53:54,960
and everything to say like, I can't pursue this with you because that's not what I want

1006
00:53:54,960 --> 00:53:55,520
for my life.

1007
00:53:55,520 --> 00:53:59,680
Like I think you are completely within your rights to do that.

1008
00:53:59,680 --> 00:54:03,040
I mean, everybody's got their stuff that they're dealing with.

1009
00:54:03,040 --> 00:54:08,640
But if this isn't the kind of stuff that you can handle, I think you can walk away and

1010
00:54:08,640 --> 00:54:09,600
not-

1011
00:54:09,600 --> 00:54:14,000
I think it's a microcosm of what you go into every time you start a relationship with someone

1012
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:18,640
where you find out like, oh, they snore or they're really bad with money or, you know,

1013
00:54:18,640 --> 00:54:19,040
it's a kind of-

1014
00:54:19,040 --> 00:54:21,280
They pee in jars and then they save the jars.

1015
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:26,320
But like you find out these things about them and then you have to make the decision.

1016
00:54:26,320 --> 00:54:30,160
Like, is this a thing that's going to bug me for the rest of my life?

1017
00:54:30,160 --> 00:54:34,560
Or is this an idiosyncrasy of this person that I care about and I can look past?

1018
00:54:34,560 --> 00:54:38,880
And so if this is a really big thing and it's a problem for you-

1019
00:54:38,880 --> 00:54:40,240
It's the biggest thing.

1020
00:54:41,360 --> 00:54:44,800
You're going to move in one day with this messy-bessy and then guess what happens?

1021
00:54:44,800 --> 00:54:46,080
You're a hoarder too, dog.

1022
00:54:46,800 --> 00:54:47,840
And suddenly you can't find your cat.

1023
00:54:47,840 --> 00:54:49,040
Oops, you caught hoarder.

1024
00:54:49,840 --> 00:54:53,920
Your cat just died in a pile of Hot Pockets boxes.

1025
00:54:55,200 --> 00:54:56,480
Oops, I missed my cat.

1026
00:54:56,480 --> 00:54:57,120
I missed my cat.

1027
00:54:57,120 --> 00:54:57,760
Where is he?

1028
00:54:57,760 --> 00:55:01,760
Son of the meatballs and stroganoff Hot Pockets boxes.

1029
00:55:01,760 --> 00:55:03,680
Um, I can't-

1030
00:55:05,840 --> 00:55:12,720
I can't say I would continue a relationship with someone in this situation,

1031
00:55:12,720 --> 00:55:16,720
but I don't know how much you care about this girl.

1032
00:55:16,720 --> 00:55:20,400
I mean like honestly, if I had started dating my wife and she had been a hoarder,

1033
00:55:22,320 --> 00:55:26,080
she's already kind of messy, but not quite hoarder levels.

1034
00:55:27,040 --> 00:55:28,960
I don't think I would have stopped-

1035
00:55:28,960 --> 00:55:31,760
I mean I don't think I could have stopped our relationship for that.

1036
00:55:31,760 --> 00:55:34,640
I probably would have just like tried to have been a good influence.

1037
00:55:34,640 --> 00:55:37,600
Like honestly though, guys, let's be honest.

1038
00:55:38,240 --> 00:55:43,360
Men out there, fellas, when you enter into any relationship,

1039
00:55:43,360 --> 00:55:46,240
you are already basically an emotional hoarder.

1040
00:55:46,240 --> 00:55:50,880
Like there are some things about you that are way more fucked up than a super messy house.

1041
00:55:51,440 --> 00:55:52,640
Like way worse.

1042
00:55:52,640 --> 00:55:52,960
There are-

1043
00:55:52,960 --> 00:55:59,120
You have some deep recesses in there that any man or woman that dates you

1044
00:55:59,120 --> 00:56:01,840
is committing to attempting to fix.

1045
00:56:01,840 --> 00:56:04,720
This is just a very external version of that.

1046
00:56:05,920 --> 00:56:11,760
If I were you, question asker, I would sit down with this person and be like,

1047
00:56:11,760 --> 00:56:15,040
hey, listen, I don't know if I'm okay with this or not.

1048
00:56:15,040 --> 00:56:18,720
I, you know, how committed are you to this whole hoarding thing?

1049
00:56:19,920 --> 00:56:21,280
Do you think this is going somewhere?

1050
00:56:21,280 --> 00:56:25,760
Do you think maybe you could like pick it up before I come over again?

1051
00:56:26,480 --> 00:56:27,760
Can you just clean?

1052
00:56:27,760 --> 00:56:29,280
Would you be willing to clean for me?

1053
00:56:29,920 --> 00:56:33,840
I think you fucking yell 3000 out and you drop a smoke bomb

1054
00:56:33,840 --> 00:56:36,480
and some cow trips and then through the window.

1055
00:56:39,280 --> 00:56:39,840
Through the wall.

1056
00:56:40,480 --> 00:56:41,600
Whatever you want to do.

1057
00:56:41,600 --> 00:56:42,640
Kool-Aid, do it.

1058
00:56:43,360 --> 00:56:43,760
Get out.

1059
00:56:43,760 --> 00:56:47,440
You know, I'm just not sure if I'm ready for things to regress with Betsy,

1060
00:56:47,440 --> 00:56:51,040
but you know, I gave her a key and she's got her own drawer in my house

1061
00:56:51,040 --> 00:56:53,200
and she's filled it with newspaper and old floss.

1062
00:56:56,720 --> 00:56:57,760
That's not funny.

1063
00:57:00,560 --> 00:57:01,520
You're a monster.

1064
00:57:02,640 --> 00:57:04,880
You're history's greatest monster.

1065
00:57:04,880 --> 00:57:05,200
Yeah.

1066
00:57:05,200 --> 00:57:05,680
Yahoo.

1067
00:57:05,680 --> 00:57:06,320
They'll pick us up.

1068
00:57:06,880 --> 00:57:07,280
Okay.

1069
00:57:07,280 --> 00:57:07,520
Yeah.

1070
00:57:09,120 --> 00:57:10,080
This Yahoo.

1071
00:57:10,080 --> 00:57:11,120
I got a Yahoo answer.

1072
00:57:11,120 --> 00:57:12,720
It was sent in by Emily Alinder.

1073
00:57:12,720 --> 00:57:13,440
Thank you, Emily.

1074
00:57:13,440 --> 00:57:16,240
It's by Yahoo answers user Miranda.

1075
00:57:17,120 --> 00:57:17,600
Colon.

1076
00:57:18,160 --> 00:57:18,800
Oh, I'm sorry.

1077
00:57:18,800 --> 00:57:22,240
It's Miranda smiley face.

1078
00:57:22,240 --> 00:57:24,160
Miranda smile asks,

1079
00:57:25,040 --> 00:57:27,360
what are some good things to write on your knuckles?

1080
00:57:28,720 --> 00:57:30,480
You know, like the tattoos on knuckles.

1081
00:57:31,040 --> 00:57:32,080
How about knuckles?

1082
00:57:32,080 --> 00:57:32,320
What?

1083
00:57:33,120 --> 00:57:34,880
You know how people get tattoos on their knuckles?

1084
00:57:36,080 --> 00:57:37,600
It's just like love and hate.

1085
00:57:39,120 --> 00:57:41,760
Envy and love.

1086
00:57:43,360 --> 00:57:45,120
Or like love and envy.

1087
00:57:46,320 --> 00:57:47,520
Like envy and hate.

1088
00:57:47,520 --> 00:57:51,520
Or like America exclamation point.

1089
00:57:51,520 --> 00:57:55,280
Or like left and right, but right is like R-I-T-E.

1090
00:57:55,280 --> 00:57:56,080
Yeah, like right aid.

1091
00:57:56,960 --> 00:57:59,200
Like CBS and right aid.

1092
00:58:00,800 --> 00:58:04,080
Or just like wall grit because you ran out of knuckles.

1093
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:07,120
Big Phil with two Gs.

1094
00:58:11,440 --> 00:58:13,120
That one helps if your name is Phil.

1095
00:58:14,080 --> 00:58:15,440
It's an important side note.

1096
00:58:15,440 --> 00:58:17,680
Sidebar, your name should be Phil.

1097
00:58:17,680 --> 00:58:23,280
I love the idea of getting something that is so recognizable,

1098
00:58:23,280 --> 00:58:25,680
but truncated because you ran out of knuckles.

1099
00:58:25,680 --> 00:58:28,320
Like get like Will Smith.

1100
00:58:35,200 --> 00:58:35,840
McDonnell.

1101
00:58:40,160 --> 00:58:41,600
Taco Bell would fit really nicely.

1102
00:58:41,600 --> 00:58:45,440
That's not a truncated one, but I mean, Taco Bell.

1103
00:58:45,440 --> 00:58:46,960
What do you want to eat for dinner tonight?

1104
00:58:46,960 --> 00:58:50,400
On the instances where the answer is Taco Bell,

1105
00:58:50,400 --> 00:58:51,440
it's a pretty boss answer.

1106
00:58:51,440 --> 00:58:52,320
Just put your fists out.

1107
00:58:52,320 --> 00:58:53,440
Like what do you think?

1108
00:58:53,440 --> 00:58:54,160
I'm trying.

1109
00:58:54,160 --> 00:58:58,000
I like the idea of having like a complete phrase like Taco Bell.

1110
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:01,840
And so when you see both hands together, it makes sense.

1111
00:59:01,840 --> 00:59:04,880
But when you just see one, you're like Bell.

1112
00:59:04,880 --> 00:59:05,440
Bell.

1113
00:59:05,440 --> 00:59:06,880
But what does that mean?

1114
00:59:06,880 --> 00:59:08,160
Why does your hand say Taco Bell?

1115
00:59:09,120 --> 00:59:11,200
This hand is for eating tacos.

1116
00:59:11,200 --> 00:59:12,720
This hand is for eating tacos.

1117
00:59:12,720 --> 00:59:14,800
This hand is for ringing bells, obviously.

1118
00:59:14,800 --> 00:59:15,680
Don't want to mix them up.

1119
00:59:15,680 --> 00:59:16,240
Obviously.

1120
00:59:18,480 --> 00:59:19,840
But according to my religion,

1121
00:59:19,840 --> 00:59:21,760
if my taco hand touches my bell hand,

1122
00:59:21,760 --> 00:59:23,040
then I have to cut them both off.

1123
00:59:23,040 --> 00:59:24,320
Well, I'm really-

1124
00:59:24,320 --> 00:59:25,520
My right hand says jerk.

1125
00:59:25,520 --> 00:59:26,720
My left hand says food.

1126
00:59:28,320 --> 00:59:28,800
Get it?

1127
00:59:28,800 --> 00:59:29,680
Don't you understand?

1128
00:59:29,680 --> 00:59:31,680
I must never confuse the two.

1129
00:59:32,480 --> 00:59:32,720
No.

1130
00:59:33,600 --> 00:59:35,360
If you wanted to put most F on there,

1131
00:59:35,360 --> 00:59:36,640
would you just put three Fs?

1132
00:59:38,880 --> 00:59:40,000
So we just say F?

1133
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:45,760
No, it would say M-O-S-D-E-F-F-F.

1134
00:59:45,760 --> 00:59:49,280
So I like this idea of using your knuckles like a vanity plate.

1135
00:59:49,280 --> 00:59:49,520
Right.

1136
00:59:50,080 --> 00:59:51,280
Too hot for you.

1137
00:59:52,560 --> 00:59:53,280
Pawn star.

1138
00:59:54,400 --> 00:59:55,120
Hot rod.

1139
00:59:56,640 --> 00:59:57,360
By the way, you guys,

1140
00:59:57,360 --> 00:59:59,360
I watched like six episodes of Pawn Star

1141
00:59:59,360 --> 01:00:01,520
while waiting for my car to get fixed at Firestone.

1142
01:00:01,520 --> 01:00:02,720
That show is so great.

1143
01:00:02,720 --> 01:00:02,880
Yeah.

1144
01:00:04,240 --> 01:00:06,320
What realizations did you come away with?

1145
01:00:06,320 --> 01:00:07,200
I hate myself.

1146
01:00:07,760 --> 01:00:08,400
No, okay.

1147
01:00:08,400 --> 01:00:10,320
Well, what about thug life?

1148
01:00:10,320 --> 01:00:13,440
But then you have the option of putting your pinky up

1149
01:00:13,440 --> 01:00:14,560
and it says hug life.

1150
01:00:19,680 --> 01:00:22,400
And then underside of your pinky is just a happy smiling man.

1151
01:00:26,640 --> 01:00:27,200
What?

1152
01:00:27,200 --> 01:00:27,600
I'm sorry.

1153
01:00:27,600 --> 01:00:30,080
I just got distracted by looking at the tiny smiling man

1154
01:00:30,080 --> 01:00:31,840
I've drawn on the underside of my pinky.

1155
01:00:32,720 --> 01:00:35,120
He's just there to help me get through the rough times.

1156
01:00:35,120 --> 01:00:36,080
Yeah, like this.

1157
01:00:36,080 --> 01:00:37,280
This would be a good example.

1158
01:00:37,280 --> 01:00:38,640
I wish I had one.

1159
01:00:38,640 --> 01:00:40,160
Well, at the end of the show,

1160
01:00:40,160 --> 01:00:42,000
I wish that I had had hello.

1161
01:00:42,640 --> 01:00:44,160
Hello, little pinky man.

1162
01:00:44,160 --> 01:00:45,360
I'm underneath your hand.

1163
01:00:46,720 --> 01:00:47,520
Don't mind me.

1164
01:00:48,800 --> 01:00:50,080
Hey, how about it Nickelodeon?

1165
01:00:50,080 --> 01:00:51,920
We're right here for all the voices you need.

1166
01:00:52,880 --> 01:00:53,520
Man.

1167
01:00:53,520 --> 01:00:55,520
I'm Dylan, the new starfish in town.

1168
01:00:57,440 --> 01:00:57,940
Kidding.

1169
01:00:59,360 --> 01:01:00,960
I'm Winston Churchill.

1170
01:01:02,480 --> 01:01:03,680
I'm a walrus.

1171
01:01:03,680 --> 01:01:06,320
I'm Winston walrus.

1172
01:01:06,320 --> 01:01:08,320
What are we doing?

1173
01:01:08,320 --> 01:01:13,280
Why does Winston walrus speak in dubstep?

1174
01:01:13,280 --> 01:01:17,280
I'm Winston walrus.

1175
01:01:17,280 --> 01:01:19,440
Get ready for the drop.

1176
01:01:19,440 --> 01:01:21,680
I have a dubstep speech impediment.

1177
01:01:21,680 --> 01:01:26,240
My speech impediment is Skrillex.

1178
01:01:26,240 --> 01:01:30,320
I'm dropping the base.

1179
01:01:30,320 --> 01:01:34,800
It's floating back up to the surface.

1180
01:01:34,800 --> 01:01:37,600
I love living underneath the sea with my friend,

1181
01:01:37,600 --> 01:01:38,880
the starfish Dylan.

1182
01:01:38,880 --> 01:01:41,520
Hello, I'm Dylan the starfish.

1183
01:01:42,800 --> 01:01:45,760
We live together with our friends in round square.

1184
01:01:47,600 --> 01:01:49,040
How about it Nickelodeon?

1185
01:01:49,040 --> 01:01:50,480
I'm right here, baby.

1186
01:01:50,480 --> 01:01:52,480
$27 and a hot meal.

1187
01:01:52,480 --> 01:01:53,440
Show me the money.

1188
01:01:53,440 --> 01:01:55,280
Show me the money and the hot meal.

1189
01:01:55,280 --> 01:01:57,440
That was actually my Cuba Gooding Jr. impression.

1190
01:01:57,440 --> 01:02:02,160
You want to do that animated series Snow Dogs,

1191
01:02:02,160 --> 01:02:03,280
but you can't afford Cuba?

1192
01:02:04,160 --> 01:02:05,360
Travis has you.

1193
01:02:05,360 --> 01:02:06,800
Show me the monies.

1194
01:02:06,800 --> 01:02:08,960
Whoa, it's like having him here on the show.

1195
01:02:09,920 --> 01:02:12,480
I can do Cuba Gooding Jr. and senior.

1196
01:02:12,480 --> 01:02:14,320
Yes, do show my son the money.

1197
01:02:21,760 --> 01:02:24,400
That's the best celebrity impression I've ever heard.

1198
01:02:24,400 --> 01:02:29,520
What about Doug Life?

1199
01:02:32,400 --> 01:02:33,680
Okay, we're done.

1200
01:02:33,680 --> 01:02:36,960
This has been our podcast, my brother, my brother and me.

1201
01:02:36,960 --> 01:02:38,560
It's an advice show, Obbs.

1202
01:02:40,880 --> 01:02:43,920
I want to thank everybody for tweeting about the show

1203
01:02:43,920 --> 01:02:49,760

1204
01:02:49,760 --> 01:02:52,960
which we put the happy news on Twitter this week.

1205
01:02:52,960 --> 01:02:55,600
We just reached 4 million downloads this week,

1206
01:02:55,600 --> 01:02:56,400
which is pretty amazing.

1207
01:02:56,400 --> 01:02:58,400
And it's all thanks to you all.

1208
01:03:01,360 --> 01:03:02,560
So thank you to those tweeting.

1209
01:03:02,560 --> 01:03:06,240

Go on.

1218
01:03:28,560 --> 01:03:28,960
It's incredible.

1219
01:03:28,960 --> 01:03:30,960

They'll treat you right.

1224
01:03:37,280 --> 01:03:37,840
Bullseye.

1225
01:03:38,560 --> 01:03:40,960
I also want to thank John Roderick and the Long Winters

1226
01:03:40,960 --> 01:03:42,720
for the use of our theme song, It's a Departure,

1227
01:03:42,720 --> 01:03:44,320
off the album, Putting the Days to Bed.

1228
01:03:45,920 --> 01:03:48,560
It's the one album that you can come back to

1229
01:03:49,520 --> 01:03:51,120
in good times and bad.

1230
01:03:51,120 --> 01:03:52,720
And hey, our friend Graham Clarke

1231
01:03:53,360 --> 01:03:55,920
just put out a stand up comedy special.

1232
01:03:56,880 --> 01:04:01,680
You can buy it for $5 at the standup comedians.com.

1233
01:04:01,680 --> 01:04:04,560
So go to the standup comedians.com, pay five bucks

1234
01:04:04,560 --> 01:04:05,680

1235

I bought it and it's really funny.

1236
01:04:09,040 --> 01:04:11,360
And he has a fantastic beard.

1237
01:04:11,360 --> 01:04:12,320
Just the best beard.

1238
01:04:12,320 --> 01:04:12,640
Just the best beard.

1239
01:04:12,640 --> 01:04:14,960
I want to thank everybody for helping me out on Friday,

01:04:33,760 --> 01:04:35,280
I mean, that may or may not be true.

1249
01:04:35,280 --> 01:04:35,680
I don't know.

1250
01:04:35,680 --> 01:04:36,800

1257

at Topo Toco.

1260
01:04:54,480 --> 01:04:56,560
The people that do our t-shirt.

1261
01:04:56,560 --> 01:04:58,560
How do you still not know how to say that fucking word?

1262
01:04:58,560 --> 01:04:59,280
Topotico?

1263
01:04:59,840 --> 01:05:00,880

1268
01:05:08,800 --> 01:05:09,920
t-shirt from them.

1269
01:05:09,920 --> 01:05:13,840
And in the special comments, I put, I love you.

1270
01:05:13,840 --> 01:05:15,200
Now don't let it get weird.

1271
01:05:15,760 --> 01:05:18,080
And they drew a picture of Garfield saying,

1272
01:05:18,080 --> 01:05:20,400
well, it's too late for that.

1273
01:05:20,400 --> 01:05:21,840
And it was like the best thing ever.

1274
01:05:21,840 --> 01:05:22,880

01:05:34,960 --> 01:05:38,080
We got a really nice email from him just saying,

1281
01:05:38,080 --> 01:05:39,600
hey, guys, I loved the goose.

1282
01:05:39,600 --> 01:05:40,480
I love the episode.

1283
01:05:40,480 --> 01:05:41,360
We've all been there.

1284
01:05:41,920 --> 01:05:43,600
We've all had that thought at some point.

1285
01:05:43,600 --> 01:05:44,800
It's not weird.

1286
01:05:44,800 --> 01:05:46,880
And thank you, Jim, for the lovely fruit basket.

1287
01:05:46,880 --> 01:05:48,240

And he said, good goose, good goose.

1289
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:50,800
It's all in good fun.

1290
01:05:50,800 --> 01:05:51,680
Don't worry about it.

1291
01:05:53,120 --> 01:05:54,720
So thank you so much, Jim Davis.

1292
01:05:54,720 --> 01:05:56,080
Thank you for being so cool.

1293
01:05:56,080 --> 01:05:58,080
Griffin, give me the last question.

1294
01:05:58,880 --> 01:05:59,440
Yeah, sure.

1295
01:06:00,560 --> 01:06:02,160
This one was sent in by question mark.

1296
01:06:02,160 --> 01:06:08,240
It's by Yahoo Answers user me, who asks opinions

1297
01:06:08,240 --> 01:06:09,760
on the name gymnasium.

1298
01:06:09,760 --> 01:06:12,240
That's J-I-M-nasium for a boy.

1299
01:06:15,200 --> 01:06:16,400
Oh, Justin McElroy.

1300
01:06:16,400 --> 01:06:17,600
I'm Travis McElroy.

1301
01:06:17,600 --> 01:06:18,640
I'm Griffin McElroy.

1302
01:06:18,640 --> 01:06:19,920
It's been my brother, my brother, and me.

1303
01:06:19,920 --> 01:06:20,560
Kiss your dad.

1304
01:06:20,560 --> 01:06:46,480
School wear on the lips.
