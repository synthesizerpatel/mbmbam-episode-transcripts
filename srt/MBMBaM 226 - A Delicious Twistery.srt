1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:30,720
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:47,600
Hello everybody, and welcome to my brother, my brother, and me, an advice show for the modern

6
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:51,120
era. I'm your oldest brother Justin McElroy. I'm your middle-est brother Travis McElroy.

7
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:57,120
I'm your baby-est baby baby Griffin McElroy. Ladies and gentlemen, we're here with a breaking,

8
00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:05,360
not really breaking, breaking update from the CBN news desk, and that is the Cake Boss news

9
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:13,040
news desk. A hot story from the great state of New Jersey. New Jersey just still trying to get

10
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:24,640
all of the particulars in order. Here's what we do know right now. Cake Boss was arrested on DWI

11
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:35,440
charges in Manhattan, driving, swerving around near Hudson Yards. DWI of course standing for

12
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:45,600
driving while I'm the Cake Boss. Right. Just so you know, prosecutors say that when arrested,

13
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:53,280
the Cake Boss said, and this is not a goof, this is not us generating the story. Travis,

14
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:59,120
do you know this? Do you know what he said? You can't arrest me. I'm the Cake Boss.

15
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:06,720
You can't arrest me. I'm the Cake Boss. Which would have been great if all the police officers

16
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:12,400
had all gone, oh shit, you're right. I forgot about that. He's got diplomatic immunity, guys.

17
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:20,560
He mastered cake. We forgot about Roe v. Betty Crocker. Yeah. His life has officially become the

18
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:30,000
first act of a Nicolas Cage movie. Like Weather Man, Family Man, Cake Man. This is the third of

19
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:36,480
his Man trilogy. Now to be fair, it actually is a case without precedent because he was driving a

20
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:43,040
car that was actually a cake that he baked. Yeah. So it's not like, how do you get a Corvette cake

21
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:50,880
up to 80? I think that's impressive enough. He stepped out of the cake car, fucking sloshed,

22
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:56,800
fucking slaughtered. It's a wrong cake car. And then the police officers were like,

23
00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:01,600
listen, Cake Boss, I hate to do this. You are a national treasure, but I have to take you to the

24
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:06,000
pokey because you're drunk. And then he ate the car in one bite and said, prove I was driving.

25
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:10,080
What car? Prove I was driving. What car? Look behind you, a fat kid just ate it.

26
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:14,400
Yeah. I think that when Cake Boss is though, I mean, we all laugh, but

27
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:24,560
if Cake Boss is in a car made of cake, he technically has diplomatic immunity in a cake

28
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:34,720
that he has constructed. So his Cake Boss, Bonifides, hold up because he is inside a

29
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:43,680
cake. He is in fact the boss. Bon appetites. His Bon appetites, hold up because he's inside a cake.

30
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:47,280
Do you think when he got out of the car, the cops were really afraid that he would touch them and

31
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:54,800
they would turn into cake? That's the only reason that he can turn out cakes at such a high speed

32
00:03:54,800 --> 00:04:01,120
and volume is that he's telling my God, the cakes have been people the whole time. You listen to me,

33
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:06,880
pigs. Don't make me take off the gloves. Don't make me take off the gloves that protect my

34
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:14,080
magic cake hands. Why isn't it working? Why isn't it working? God, I'm drunk.

35
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:21,760
Oh, Cake Boss, Cake Boss. Maybe, should we practice? Should we like,

36
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:27,440
because I think we're assuming a lot when you read on paper and you know what? They used

37
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:32,240
exclamation points in the quote, which is like a journalistic no-no because it's a leading

38
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:36,720
punctuation, right? Because the way that it's written now, you read it and you think it's like,

39
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:41,520
you can't arrest me, I'm the Cake Boss, angry like that. But what if it was like kind of sweet,

40
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:47,280
like, ah, come on, guys. Come on, guys, you can't arrest me, I'm the Cake Boss.

41
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:51,280
Or what if the like just the punctuation was all wrong and he said, you can't,

42
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:58,480
oh God, arrest me, I'm the Cake Boss. Put me in jail for pastry crimes.

43
00:04:58,480 --> 00:05:01,200
Stop me before I bake again. Oh God.

44
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:11,600
So this is an advice ship where we try to help Cake Boss navigate the choppy waters of his life.

45
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:17,360
But let's get to actually helping people because I want to get my help on today.

46
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:22,080
Okay. What is the proper etiquette when showering in someone else's home?

47
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:29,280
Are soap slash shampoo slash other shower equipment up for grabs? Is there some sort

48
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:33,520
of unspoken line like shower gel is okay to borrow but someone's bar soap is gross?

49
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:39,200
Or is using anything in someone else's shower unacceptable? And I'm basically a social pariah

50
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:43,120
for even having to ask this question. That's from Befuddled in Baltimore.

51
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:48,640
I was thinking that we'd answered this question before, and we may have. Time is a fucking flat

52
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:52,960
circle. And we've been doing this for like 800 years. But I think I was actually thinking of

53
00:05:52,960 --> 00:06:00,720
like episode two, which was 223 episodes ago, where we talked about peeing in the shower at

54
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:02,800
somebody else's house. Right.

55
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:08,560
And I'm almost certain that we probably wang that one. And time and maturity would allow us to come

56
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:13,840
up with a much better answer. So I guess this is new territory. And I'd say, yeah, go for it.

57
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:23,920
I think the line is what touches the body. So like, oh, yeah.

58
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:29,440
Liquid soap? Yes. Loofah? No.

59
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:33,840
Here's the thing. I want to go with you. I want to say yes, Justin. I want to agree.

60
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:37,120
But I know that I've used other people's loofahs before.

61
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:39,440
There. There. I said it.

62
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:41,440
You haven't used it. Not my loofah.

63
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:42,480
Certainly not mine.

64
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:47,360
You're applying water and soap to it. Like you're inherently washing it as you wash yourself.

65
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:53,040
Unless you have just gotten back from like working in a slaughterhouse,

66
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:55,360
what horrible things are you scraping off your body?

67
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:58,560
Ball. Ball essence.

68
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:02,400
Ball essence. Slivers of balls.

69
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:05,440
Well, then otherwise you're just going to use their fancy products and put them in like the

70
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:08,400
palm of your hand and scrub yourself like a Neanderthal.

71
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:09,200
Yeah. Yes.

72
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:13,600
Yes. That's how I've been bathing myself. I can't even have a loofah in my home anymore

73
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:17,760
because sometimes you're at my house and God knows you might just slip up there.

74
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:20,240
Slip up there and treat yourself to a little scrubby scrub.

75
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:23,280
Well, I bathed several times a day.

76
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:25,040
That's true.

77
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:28,880
I think that staying at someone's house and using their shower products,

78
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:33,440
let's take loofahs out of the equation, is like staying at a hotel and use it.

79
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:37,040
Like because then where else do you draw the line? Because if you say no,

80
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:40,240
then do you just get in and use water and pretend like that's it?

81
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:48,320
No. Okay. First off, maybe you have some special soap that you like.

82
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:53,760
That's going to be the problem. I got that in my birch box yesterday.

83
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:59,520
I was really looking forward to using that plush tea tree oil shampoo and now it's all gone.

84
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:01,280
Now it's gone. Gonzo.

85
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:03,360
You drank it? God damn it.

86
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:08,320
God damn it, Cake Paws. You have a problem. Get out of my house.

87
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:13,360
Why did I ever let you in here? No, I mean, but this is the thing, right?

88
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:17,200
With everything like this, there's always a double standard.

89
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:24,480
There is what we, the hosts of a comedy advice podcast will tell you.

90
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:29,600
There's what you're going to do when no one's looking, which is always going to be different.

91
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:35,600
But we all have our little secrets that we do in the secret behind the curtain.

92
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:43,760
Is it too much for us to ask that everybody who listens to this show live their lives through the

93
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:48,640
lens of imagining that we are constantly watching them wherever they are,

94
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:51,440
wherever they are, no matter what they're doing, our eyes are on you.

95
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:55,600
And it's like a judgment thing. It's not like a sexy thing. Okay.

96
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:59,120
It can be if that's, it won't be for us. It's imaginary in your brain.

97
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:02,560
If you want it to be a sexy thing, go ahead. It's your play space.

98
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:10,880
Ooh, I just had an idea. This could be what all of those hotel baths and so, you know,

99
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:17,280
the soaps and stuff that you steal are for like make a little basket, keep it in your linen

100
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:21,520
closet. And then when you have guests stay with you, like you set it out, like you set out their

101
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:26,800
towels and washcloths and stuff. What is the, I, but I just don't have any,

102
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:30,880
I don't have any problem with somebody using my shampoo, like use my shampoo and conditioner,

103
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:37,360
treat yourself. Don't rub things on your things that go on my things. I want no thing to think.

104
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:42,160
You should cross stitch that over your toilet. Yeah. Keep your things off my things.

105
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:47,200
Keep your things off my things. Ebola is real. Here's another factor that we're not considering

106
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:51,760
is that my, my labs, shower products have a very distinctive smell.

107
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:58,480
Um, and if Travis walks out of the master bathroom at the, at the Griffin and Rachel McElroy estate,

108
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:04,960
um, smelling like my bath, I'm going to be fucking furious with you.

109
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:08,400
Are you afraid that you'll just like Pavlovian response become aroused?

110
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:12,080
You'll be attracted to me in a weird way and you won't be able to put your finger on it.

111
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:15,520
I'll be able to put my finger directly on it. Um,

112
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:20,720
Can we go one fucking week on the show without one of us trying to ramp up the sexual tension?

113
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:28,640
I refuse to let this become a Ross and Ross and Rachel show. This is not happening.

114
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:34,160
It's it's, it's our Tumblr slash fiction game is falling off. There just are not enough

115
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:38,800
fans shipping us and it's a problem and our stock is slipping.

116
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:47,280
That's what people want. Maybe in our webisodes, our webisodes that you can get with our companion

117
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:52,160
app that don't exist. Don't, don't tell people that it doesn't exist. Uh, do you guys know Yahoo?

118
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:55,120
Absolutely. I'm cleaning my glasses real quick.

119
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:57,200
Dramatically.

120
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:02,240
Hold on. I couldn't see the screen cause my glasses were dirty.

121
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:04,080
Okay. You guys ready for Yahoo?

122
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:06,720
Yep. Go for it. Dirty boy.

123
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:13,440
Um, this Yahoo was sent in by Sarah Benson. Thank you, Sarah. Uh, it's by Yahoo answers user Nathan,

124
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:19,520
who asks, what should you do when you see your principal by beer?

125
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:28,480
What should you do when you see your principal by beer? And I, I hit that hard P there,

126
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:32,400
that plosive P, um, because they spelled the goddamn word wrong.

127
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:38,320
That's how you know that it's by the way, a legit Yahoo answers and off some fakey, fake,

128
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:45,200
jokey joke bullshit is if they spell a word wrong, usually it's a 12 year old. Um, this Nathan,

129
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:51,040
by the way, has been a member since October 31st, 2014. So something tells me Nathan was maybe at

130
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:57,920
the speed speedway on Halloween and saw his principal getting ready to get fucking wrecked.

131
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:05,840
Okay. I think about this and at first I want to jump to like, Oh, you stupid. But then I think

132
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:11,280
about what if I was 12 and I saw my principal in the wild, like buying beer, like I would have

133
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:16,240
thought that was scandalous. I would have thought he might as well like be buying crystal math.

134
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:19,840
Here's a weird thought exercise for everybody. Think about all the times that you've seen

135
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:24,160
teachers in the wild. We've all done that. We've all, I feel like we talked about that on the show

136
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:30,640
that none of them ever remember us, which is devastating. Um, nobody ever sees a principal

137
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:36,320
in the wild. It just doesn't happen. They are the fucking scariest human beings on earth when

138
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:41,920
you're 12 years old and they don't exist outside of the school. They're fucking holograms projected

139
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:48,720
by the ghost heart of the school. That was always the weird thing about, um, the principal.

140
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:55,040
Like when I, when I was in school, they seem to be in another, like I didn't get sent to the

141
00:12:55,040 --> 00:13:00,080
principal's office, right? I was a good kid, but there did seem to be kids that, um, got sent to

142
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:04,320
the principal's office a lot that seemed to have developed. Like whenever I'd walk by and see them

143
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:10,240
in there, there seemed to be some sort of comradery in there. Yeah. Like a principal. Yeah. For like

144
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:15,200
the repeat offenders, they seem to like hang out a lot and that they had developed some sort of

145
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:19,520
affinity for them. I was always a little jealous, but I wasn't going to like live the life that

146
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:23,280
demanded me in the principal's office. Do you think that after a while it becomes like yours

147
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:28,720
in the principal's secret tea time and it's like, see you back again tomorrow at 11. Yep.

148
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:32,160
Yep. I know you hate math, Jim. I'll see you down here.

149
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:38,720
As, um, as sort of earth shattering, as it might've been to see my principal buying beer

150
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:43,440
when I was a kid, I think I would run an equal risk of having my perception shipped to them

151
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:52,320
now as an adult, seeing what beer they buy, right? That is very, that is like, if I,

152
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:57,440
if I'm walking in and like this person who has been sort of an authority figure, almost a,

153
00:13:57,440 --> 00:14:04,480
uh, a messianic figure in my life. And I see them with a, like a case of beast.

154
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:11,360
Like I can't, I can't with this, with this. Is Mr. Lake buying a cube of Mike's hard lemonade?

155
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:18,800
Is that a cube of limeritas? I hope that's for like a party and not just for him. Certainly

156
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:24,000
he's not just buying like 24 for himself. Tell me you're fucking buying ironic

157
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:29,040
cramberitas. Cause I cannot, I cannot see you as an authority figure.

158
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:32,560
Does he have just a bag of buzz balls? Is he okay?

159
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:38,000
Where did Mrs. Scott even find Four Loko? Is that Five Loko?

160
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:43,360
Is that Five Loko, an illegal and even more illegal version of Four Loko that they only

161
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:47,440
sell to principals? If I don't go to sleep, Monday can't come.

162
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:56,240
Oh shit. That should be the fucking slogan of Sparks

163
00:14:56,240 --> 00:15:01,360
and Four Loko. If you don't go to sleep, Monday can't come.

164
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:06,880
Um, I would say you maybe do a little bit of extortion here and you walk up and you say,

165
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:12,320
hey Mrs. Scott, those Five Locos look tall and delicious and you're going to have a really

166
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:16,160
great time with them, but I am going to put you on blast come Monday. Unless maybe you sign me

167
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:20,880
and Bryce here a couple of cans and then you and Bryce go and you squirrel them away in,

168
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:24,320
in his loft. And then it's your secret treasure forever.

169
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:25,840
It's weird.

170
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:30,880
You got to go, you got to go house of cards. You got to take the picture with your camera first

171
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:36,160
and then say, oh, it would be such a shame if this got Snapchat and if it got Snapchat,

172
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:41,840
you would have no idea of how to access it or find it or anything. Cause Snapchat is a secret.

173
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:46,160
And, and then you go eat some ribs. I haven't seen very much of the show.

174
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:53,520
And then you go to the poker tournament. It's cause it's cards. It's weird to me. I'm sitting

175
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:58,800
here thinking like there's so many like stereotypes and thoughts that we all have about teachers.

176
00:15:58,800 --> 00:15:59,280
Yeah.

177
00:15:59,280 --> 00:16:00,400
I don't really have those.

178
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:04,240
Anything about principles and principles are just like super teachers. They're teachers who

179
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:05,440
fucking evolved.

180
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,920
Because I wanted to say like, isn't it,

181
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:12,720
isn't it like the principal's right and duty to have a beer because he's got to deal with

182
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:17,280
kids all day long. And then I was like, wait, hold on. Who's just saying that they do. Maybe

183
00:16:17,280 --> 00:16:20,080
they're sitting there going, I hope someone gets in trouble today.

184
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:24,320
New segment on the show. Principal watch. If you are a principal listening to the show,

185
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:27,440
or you're in close contact with the principal outside of a school setting,

186
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:32,800
give us the dirt. We want to know all your principal stories. Principal watch.

187
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:38,560
Is it, I feel like every school I went to, the standard was that the principal was like this

188
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:45,760
totally hands-off leader that nobody ever saw except at like pep rallies. But the vice principal

189
00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:51,040
was a fucking badass that would like wreck you if you stepped out of line. Like that was the

190
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:52,800
person that you really had to be afraid of.

191
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:55,920
Man, I would go drunk. I would go power mad.

192
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:56,420
Yeah.

193
00:16:56,420 --> 00:17:03,620
I would. I would. You know, I always judged, you know, you judge the vice principal. It's very easy

194
00:17:03,620 --> 00:17:07,700
to judge the vice principal when you're young. Like, oh, that guy's such a creep. I would be

195
00:17:08,340 --> 00:17:10,180
the absolute worst.

196
00:17:10,180 --> 00:17:16,500
How, how can we never hear more about vice principals conspiring to kill the principal

197
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:17,220
to become them?

198
00:17:20,180 --> 00:17:22,900
Just, why don't we hear more about that? It's 2014.

199
00:17:22,900 --> 00:17:27,940
The answer is that of course they are a ghost that is projected by the ghost heart of the school.

200
00:17:27,940 --> 00:17:30,500
Everyone knows this. This is common. How about another question?

201
00:17:31,780 --> 00:17:34,340
There's a guy at work who I get the feeling is into me.

202
00:17:35,140 --> 00:17:39,860
However, I'm not keen on dating a coworker and I've told him this. He's smart. He's funny.

203
00:17:39,860 --> 00:17:46,100
He's charming. And we match really well. He would be perfect for me except for the work thing.

204
00:17:46,100 --> 00:17:47,700
And I'm not super attracted to him.

205
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:48,420
Well then.

206
00:17:48,420 --> 00:17:50,260
So just those two things.

207
00:17:50,260 --> 00:17:55,940
Let me just as one, I am starting to like him more as we become friends.

208
00:17:56,660 --> 00:18:01,140
My girlfriend warned, this is the, by the way, your grandkids are going to love this meat.

209
00:18:01,140 --> 00:18:01,700
Cute.

210
00:18:01,700 --> 00:18:05,860
Wow. What a fucking sweeping romance this is.

211
00:18:06,740 --> 00:18:12,740
My girlfriend warned me. He may be doing the wear down method, the passive aggressive.

212
00:18:12,740 --> 00:18:17,460
Maybe she'll see me as something more one day method. Is that real?

213
00:18:17,460 --> 00:18:20,900
I kind of think it's starting to work. What should I do, brothers?

214
00:18:20,900 --> 00:18:24,500
That's from can't decide in Canada. I cannot believe you've done this.

215
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:26,180
I can't believe you've done this.

216
00:18:26,180 --> 00:18:32,180
I can't believe works for 226 episodes to convince people not to do this thing you're talking about.

217
00:18:32,180 --> 00:18:34,020
And now you're reinforcing this thing.

218
00:18:34,020 --> 00:18:35,380
Now you're done doing it.

219
00:18:35,380 --> 00:18:37,540
Is this a thing? Of course it's a thing.

220
00:18:37,540 --> 00:18:41,300
And well, is it a thing though?

221
00:18:41,300 --> 00:18:43,300
It's the ducky. I call it the ducky.

222
00:18:44,420 --> 00:18:46,980
I can't think of the method as anything other than the ducky.

223
00:18:46,980 --> 00:18:51,620
The, the, is this good enough? That's what ducky sounds like in my mind. I haven't seen the movie.

224
00:18:52,260 --> 00:18:56,820
Um, I, it's just like, it's, is it, is it a thing?

225
00:18:56,820 --> 00:19:00,100
I don't, I think I'm uncomfortable with the term wear down because that,

226
00:19:00,100 --> 00:19:03,380
that intimates that there's like, I don't know that you have this thick,

227
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:12,020
thick lustrous chitin that, that this person is eroding by just like being, being nice, I guess.

228
00:19:12,820 --> 00:19:14,740
Griffin, let me put it in this context.

229
00:19:14,740 --> 00:19:20,820
If you are just friends with the person, um, and by you, I mean the person that would, uh,

230
00:19:20,820 --> 00:19:25,380
do the wear down, quote unquote, if you were just friends with no ulterior motive,

231
00:19:25,380 --> 00:19:28,900
and then one day take both of you kind of realize you have feelings for each other,

232
00:19:28,900 --> 00:19:31,940
then you're just getting to know each other and you grow closer together.

233
00:19:31,940 --> 00:19:35,620
If you have feelings for the person from the beginning and they tell you that you're not

234
00:19:35,620 --> 00:19:40,660
interested and you put all your effort and set your sights onto convincing them to like you,

235
00:19:40,660 --> 00:19:44,820
that's called the wearing down, like there's no other word for it in my mind than like,

236
00:19:44,820 --> 00:19:46,020
I'm going to wear them down.

237
00:19:46,020 --> 00:19:49,300
But it doesn't, I mean, there's nothing in this question though that makes it sound like they're,

238
00:19:49,300 --> 00:19:53,460
except for the fact that the, the friend thinks that he's wearing them down, but based on what

239
00:19:53,460 --> 00:20:00,580
this question asker has said, she, she gets the feeling that he's into her and he, she told him

240
00:20:00,580 --> 00:20:06,260
that he's not, she's, oh Christ, she doesn't want to date a coworker, right? But it doesn't,

241
00:20:06,260 --> 00:20:11,700
she didn't say like, and then like, he keeps buying me chocolate. It's not, you know?

242
00:20:11,700 --> 00:20:15,860
I guess the weird factor in here is like, if you're not super attracted to him,

243
00:20:15,860 --> 00:20:19,780
when you say you're just like starting to like him more, do you mean like as a person,

244
00:20:19,780 --> 00:20:22,420
like he's fun to be around and you enjoy his friendship?

245
00:20:23,620 --> 00:20:28,900
Because unless like you become more and more attracted to him along with liking him more,

246
00:20:28,900 --> 00:20:31,540
then that just means you're becoming friends with someone.

247
00:20:31,540 --> 00:20:35,540
I think, I think the idea of the wear down method is gross. So we've talked about that before of

248
00:20:35,540 --> 00:20:41,860
like approaching friendship with the ultimate ulterior motive of I'm, I'm trying to hit that.

249
00:20:42,420 --> 00:20:48,340
Please, please may I hit it? That sucks, right? That's rough. But don't like, don't let yourself

250
00:20:48,340 --> 00:20:55,140
be so skeptical of a person's like friendliness that you just like immediately assume like,

251
00:20:55,140 --> 00:20:59,140
oh, you're trying to hit this, please. Do you know, do you know how you know?

252
00:20:59,140 --> 00:21:03,060
How do you know, Joe? It's in his jokes. It's in his jokes.

253
00:21:03,060 --> 00:21:09,140
Stop it. It's not, it is because, because if like he's occasionally dropping something like,

254
00:21:09,140 --> 00:21:13,460
well, I guess we look pretty cute together today, huh? Oh, matching sweaters. Like that kind of

255
00:21:13,460 --> 00:21:19,860
thing. Then it's like, Oh, okay. He's like testing the waters with those jokes to see how you respond

256
00:21:19,860 --> 00:21:25,140
to them. That's I think like the greatest clue that someone is trying to do the quote unquote

257
00:21:25,140 --> 00:21:29,460
wear down. Like this is a challenge because I act like I'm into everybody.

258
00:21:29,460 --> 00:21:30,100
Yeah.

259
00:21:30,100 --> 00:21:32,740
Man and woman. That's just me. You know?

260
00:21:32,740 --> 00:21:36,660
Animal, animal, mineral, vegetable, plasma.

261
00:21:36,660 --> 00:21:39,780
I'm a flirt machine. I'll flirt with anything. I don't care.

262
00:21:39,780 --> 00:21:41,460
Justin flirted with the sun yesterday.

263
00:21:42,020 --> 00:21:47,700
I flirted with the sun like Icarus. He flirted with failure.

264
00:21:48,820 --> 00:21:50,340
We're all flirting with failure here.

265
00:21:52,340 --> 00:21:56,420
I think that should be the name of the show. Um, I, it sounds like she's overthinking this

266
00:21:56,420 --> 00:22:03,220
maybe he or she, I guess I should say, cause it's not, it's not, uh, quantified here. Um,

267
00:22:03,220 --> 00:22:08,820
it sounds like maybe overthinking it. Like maybe just kind of like go with it,

268
00:22:08,820 --> 00:22:12,740
go with the flow and see, see how you feel. But like, I don't know.

269
00:22:12,740 --> 00:22:16,260
Just do what you're comfortable. Just be, just do what you're comfortable with.

270
00:22:17,620 --> 00:22:21,700
And if it becomes clear that he is still interested in you,

271
00:22:21,700 --> 00:22:25,700
whether he's wearing you down or not, that's not important. If it becomes clear that he's

272
00:22:25,700 --> 00:22:30,100
still interested in you and you are not interested in him or interested in dating a coworker,

273
00:22:30,100 --> 00:22:33,620
then maybe you just need to stop spending so much time with him or, I mean,

274
00:22:33,620 --> 00:22:36,420
you've already said it to him that you're not interested in dating a coworker.

275
00:22:36,420 --> 00:22:40,420
So if he doesn't listen to that, then you just need to stop spending time with him.

276
00:22:40,420 --> 00:22:42,260
If you don't want to spend time with him anymore,

277
00:22:42,260 --> 00:22:45,140
like you're under no obligation to become closer with this dude.

278
00:22:46,420 --> 00:22:50,660
It's weird because this is actually two kind of issues that are being dealt with here.

279
00:22:50,660 --> 00:22:56,660
On the one hand, it's this idea of the wear down, but on the other, it's this,

280
00:22:57,460 --> 00:23:04,580
the idea of not dating a coworker. So, I mean, I don't know if your resolve is slipping there.

281
00:23:04,580 --> 00:23:10,260
Like if that's sort of the issue or it's just your feelings in general for him.

282
00:23:10,260 --> 00:23:14,340
Because I think that your rule about not dating a coworker is like the best.

283
00:23:14,340 --> 00:23:16,260
It's very, it's a rule.

284
00:23:16,260 --> 00:23:17,860
That can be very sexy.

285
00:23:17,860 --> 00:23:20,020
It can be.

286
00:23:20,020 --> 00:23:24,100
I do think, however, that that rule falls into the same kind of category for me as when people say,

287
00:23:24,100 --> 00:23:28,180
like, I'm just want to focus on schoolwork or I'm just not looking for a relationship right now.

288
00:23:28,180 --> 00:23:32,660
Like it's a really good rule to have until you like meet that person who just blows you away.

289
00:23:32,660 --> 00:23:34,420
Because what if it's love?

290
00:23:34,420 --> 00:23:35,220
What if it's love?

291
00:23:35,220 --> 00:23:35,940
That's what I'm saying.

292
00:23:35,940 --> 00:23:36,660
How about a Yahoo?

293
00:23:37,220 --> 00:23:37,620
Okay.

294
00:23:37,620 --> 00:23:41,460
This Yahoo was sent in by Rachel Sperling, who has been killing it lately.

295
00:23:41,460 --> 00:23:44,420
Game, recognize game, Rachel Sperling.

296
00:23:45,380 --> 00:23:47,300
Yahoo answers user mobile.

297
00:23:47,300 --> 00:23:55,940
Uh, member since November 13th, 2014.

298
00:23:56,740 --> 00:23:59,700
The Yahoo answer service is fucking expanding.

299
00:23:59,700 --> 00:24:00,980
Is blowing up.

300
00:24:00,980 --> 00:24:02,020
New users.

301
00:24:02,020 --> 00:24:07,460
Mobile asks, what happens if I drink water without interruption?

302
00:24:07,460 --> 00:24:09,380
Would my pee keep going?

303
00:24:09,380 --> 00:24:10,980
Could I pee like this forever?

304
00:24:13,940 --> 00:24:15,300
Could I pee like that?

305
00:24:15,300 --> 00:24:19,620
Could I, is it possible that I could pee like this?

306
00:24:19,620 --> 00:24:20,660
Dream come true.

307
00:24:23,140 --> 00:24:25,940
I don't want to close my eyes.

308
00:24:27,620 --> 00:24:29,860
I don't want to stop this pee.

309
00:24:29,860 --> 00:24:30,660
Oh man.

310
00:24:30,660 --> 00:24:34,660
Could you just turn yourself into a beautiful Greco Roman fountain?

311
00:24:34,660 --> 00:24:38,740
We learned from Austin Powers, the spy who shagged me that if you drink some water,

312
00:24:38,740 --> 00:24:40,500
you can immediately start peeing again.

313
00:24:41,940 --> 00:24:42,260
What?

314
00:24:42,260 --> 00:24:46,980
What he does that in a scene cause he unplugs the fountain and then he's worried the guard

315
00:24:46,980 --> 00:24:48,980
will notice that the fountains not on anymore.

316
00:24:49,860 --> 00:24:50,020
Yeah.

317
00:24:50,020 --> 00:24:51,540
And he's eating some asparagus in there.

318
00:24:51,540 --> 00:24:55,540
And then that's how he gets caught because the guard can smell the asparagus and his

319
00:24:55,540 --> 00:24:58,740
pee that he just ate and immediately peed out.

320
00:24:58,740 --> 00:24:59,140
Two questions.

321
00:24:59,140 --> 00:25:01,300
Why did they stop making these movies?

322
00:25:01,300 --> 00:25:01,940
Fuck me.

323
00:25:03,620 --> 00:25:05,540
God damn comedy gold.

324
00:25:05,540 --> 00:25:08,340
And we just, we just decided to leave that gold buried.

325
00:25:08,340 --> 00:25:10,180
And I want to clarify a correction.

326
00:25:10,180 --> 00:25:11,380
It was in gold member.

327
00:25:11,380 --> 00:25:11,700
Okay.

328
00:25:11,700 --> 00:25:12,420
That's why I don't remember it.

329
00:25:12,420 --> 00:25:14,100
Cause I knew it was poopy garbage.

330
00:25:15,940 --> 00:25:18,820
Could I pee like this forever?

331
00:25:20,180 --> 00:25:22,100
Could I pee like this forever?

332
00:25:22,740 --> 00:25:22,980
All right.

333
00:25:22,980 --> 00:25:25,060
Now let's, let's actually look at this.

334
00:25:25,060 --> 00:25:25,940
Let's think about it.

335
00:25:25,940 --> 00:25:30,420
We know that we know that if you drink water later, you will pee.

336
00:25:30,420 --> 00:25:31,220
Pee comes out of you.

337
00:25:31,940 --> 00:25:32,260
Right.

338
00:25:32,260 --> 00:25:37,140
I think the problem and, and I do, I mean, so that system is working.

339
00:25:37,140 --> 00:25:44,340
I think the problem would be that the lead on the pee that you would need would be so

340
00:25:45,220 --> 00:25:51,380
I don't think you'd be able to drink enough before the piece started to keep it going permanently.

341
00:25:52,740 --> 00:25:58,580
But I think that in this fiction that mobile has created, he's saying, or she's saying,

342
00:25:58,580 --> 00:26:05,860
what if it was just like a, I could keep drinking like quantity capacity was not an issue.

343
00:26:05,860 --> 00:26:08,180
Scientifically, how much do you displace?

344
00:26:08,180 --> 00:26:08,500
Right.

345
00:26:08,500 --> 00:26:11,140
Pints, pints per minute.

346
00:26:11,140 --> 00:26:15,140
Your pee, you gotta look at your PPM and then you measure that.

347
00:26:15,140 --> 00:26:19,300
And then you just displace that by drinking the same amount of water.

348
00:26:19,300 --> 00:26:21,540
And you're not going to be chugging.

349
00:26:21,540 --> 00:26:24,340
You know, the pee doesn't fall out of you that quickly.

350
00:26:26,020 --> 00:26:29,780
So I think as long as you displace it like that and you keep it going, you keep it float,

351
00:26:29,780 --> 00:26:33,220
keep it, just keep the stream rolling.

352
00:26:33,220 --> 00:26:37,220
Big wheel keep on turning, then you're going to be able to turn yourself into a beautiful fountain

353
00:26:37,220 --> 00:26:38,900
like in that hilarious gold member movie.

354
00:26:39,540 --> 00:26:43,220
But then the question is like, how much water turns into how much pee?

355
00:26:43,220 --> 00:26:45,380
Like, are you taking one to one, one to one?

356
00:26:45,380 --> 00:26:48,660
You add some yellow in there somewhere in your body, probably in the gallbladder.

357
00:26:49,220 --> 00:26:52,820
And then then then it's ready to go ready to ship that product out.

358
00:26:53,940 --> 00:26:55,700
Could this work?

359
00:26:55,700 --> 00:26:56,020
Yes.

360
00:26:56,580 --> 00:26:57,460
For another?

361
00:26:58,100 --> 00:26:59,300
Oh, Justin.

362
00:26:59,300 --> 00:27:02,980
And did you become a dirt machine?

363
00:27:05,300 --> 00:27:06,260
A dirt machine.

364
00:27:06,260 --> 00:27:07,460
You shouldn't have.

365
00:27:07,460 --> 00:27:08,820
You eat that food.

366
00:27:08,820 --> 00:27:12,980
You eat a taco, pizza, ramen noodle, dirt machine.

367
00:27:12,980 --> 00:27:17,380
You, I feel like are the most equipped to make this experiment happen with your baby.

368
00:27:17,380 --> 00:27:18,500
What is that supposed to mean?

369
00:27:18,500 --> 00:27:26,660
With your baby, because your baby, as a baby, the pipes there are so short, short pipes.

370
00:27:26,660 --> 00:27:30,980
We're that's probably like a that's probably like a 15 minute exchange all told.

371
00:27:32,260 --> 00:27:39,300
I think what I think what you're describing leads to a pretty chilly reception from the

372
00:27:39,300 --> 00:27:41,300
jury on my part.

373
00:27:41,300 --> 00:27:47,620
I think I think what you're describing is a fairly is a fairly cold shoulder from a

374
00:27:47,620 --> 00:27:48,500
jury of my peers.

375
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:51,620
And in conclusion, science, science.

376
00:27:51,620 --> 00:27:55,860
In conclusion, I was trying to discover science.

377
00:27:55,860 --> 00:27:57,700
I'll take my children to jail.

378
00:27:57,700 --> 00:28:00,020
I asked, I will go to jail now.

379
00:28:00,020 --> 00:28:02,100
I asked myself, can I?

380
00:28:02,100 --> 00:28:04,020
But I never asked myself, should I?

381
00:28:04,020 --> 00:28:08,020
But if I had the answer still would have been yes, because it was pretty great.

382
00:28:08,020 --> 00:28:12,100
So now I'm slapping him on a lunchbox and I'm selling it.

383
00:28:12,100 --> 00:28:27,460
I am starving.

384
00:28:27,460 --> 00:28:33,620
We're recording this on a rare Saturday morning and my hunger is off the charts right now.

385
00:28:35,220 --> 00:28:39,540
Do you guys have any big like Saturday plans that that maybe you'll be snacking during?

386
00:28:39,540 --> 00:28:41,860
Uh, we got that.

387
00:28:41,860 --> 00:28:44,660
I gotta watch Marshall beat Rice.

388
00:28:44,660 --> 00:28:45,940
Go herd.

389
00:28:45,940 --> 00:28:46,660
Go herd.

390
00:28:46,660 --> 00:28:48,180
I've got a herd on.

391
00:28:48,180 --> 00:28:49,940
I've got a herd on too, Travis.

392
00:28:49,940 --> 00:28:54,980
I have thundering herd erectile dysfunction.

393
00:28:56,740 --> 00:28:58,180
I have a semi herd on.

394
00:28:59,540 --> 00:29:01,540
Have you guys ever noticed that sounds like a hard on?

395
00:29:01,540 --> 00:29:03,300
Oh my God, you're right.

396
00:29:03,300 --> 00:29:05,460
Guys, tell me about Nature Box.

397
00:29:05,460 --> 00:29:09,620
Nature Box is going to give you some free snacks.

398
00:29:09,620 --> 00:29:10,340
How does that sound?

399
00:29:11,140 --> 00:29:11,700
Here's the thing.

400
00:29:12,420 --> 00:29:17,540
There's delicious, wholesome snacks available at naturebox.com.

401
00:29:17,540 --> 00:29:18,820
It's like a subscription service.

402
00:29:19,540 --> 00:29:25,860
You tell them which of their snacks that you want to try and they will send you a box of them

403
00:29:27,140 --> 00:29:28,020
in the mail every month.

404
00:29:28,020 --> 00:29:30,900
Now, but before you like commit to that, cause that's a lot.

405
00:29:30,900 --> 00:29:32,100
That's a lot to commit to.

406
00:29:32,100 --> 00:29:38,580
They're going to send you a free trial sampler to enjoy all on your own.

407
00:29:38,580 --> 00:29:39,700
Can you imagine?

408
00:29:39,700 --> 00:29:44,100
I can because people are tweeting at us all the time with pictures of their free cocoa.

409
00:29:44,100 --> 00:29:46,660
I can because I'm eating Nature Box right now.

410
00:29:46,660 --> 00:29:47,220
Yeah.

411
00:29:47,220 --> 00:29:49,060
What are you, what are you, what are you notching?

412
00:29:49,060 --> 00:29:54,740
I've got some plantain chips, which I thought would be sweet and are actually savory and super

413
00:29:54,740 --> 00:29:55,140
good.

414
00:29:55,140 --> 00:29:58,740
Yeah, plantains are just a palette for spices to be painted on.

415
00:29:59,700 --> 00:30:01,140
I want to talk about clusters this week.

416
00:30:01,140 --> 00:30:01,460
Oh, shit.

417
00:30:01,460 --> 00:30:02,740
That's what I'm into this week.

418
00:30:02,740 --> 00:30:03,540
Like scientific?

419
00:30:03,540 --> 00:30:06,180
Black sesame seed, black sesame seed clusters.

420
00:30:06,980 --> 00:30:08,900
Those are limited edition through December.

421
00:30:08,900 --> 00:30:09,940
So you don't want to miss out on that.

422
00:30:09,940 --> 00:30:14,260
Blueberry almond bites, which I love, cashew power clusters.

423
00:30:14,900 --> 00:30:18,420
That's what the transformers were fighting over, if I remember correctly.

424
00:30:19,860 --> 00:30:22,580
We have to retrieve the cashew power clusters.

425
00:30:23,700 --> 00:30:29,860
If you want to get your free box and start dipping in, go to naturebox.com slash my brother

426
00:30:29,860 --> 00:30:32,900
and you're going to, it's not, it won't cost you money.

427
00:30:32,900 --> 00:30:35,380
It's a free trial box.

428
00:30:35,380 --> 00:30:38,420
And you're not going to get artificial flavors or colors or sweeteners.

429
00:30:39,060 --> 00:30:41,700
And there's no trans fats or high fructose corn syrup.

430
00:30:41,700 --> 00:30:43,940
You're just going to get fed and full and happy.

431
00:30:44,660 --> 00:30:45,700
From nature.

432
00:30:45,700 --> 00:30:47,060
From nature for once.

433
00:30:47,860 --> 00:30:53,940
Go to naturebox.com slash my brother and get a free trial box of delicious snacks.

434
00:30:53,940 --> 00:30:56,980
Isn't it time that nature gave something back to you?

435
00:30:56,980 --> 00:31:04,420
Now say I love my trial box and I decide immediately that I want to purchase $35,000

436
00:31:04,420 --> 00:31:05,620
worth of nature box snacks.

437
00:31:05,620 --> 00:31:05,940
Mm-hmm.

438
00:31:07,060 --> 00:31:09,140
Then you would be making a wise investment.

439
00:31:09,140 --> 00:31:11,380
I am, I am a hoarder.

440
00:31:11,380 --> 00:31:13,620
The doomsday is just around the corner.

441
00:31:13,620 --> 00:31:16,100
The polar vortex is killing us all.

442
00:31:16,100 --> 00:31:17,540
It's already started.

443
00:31:17,540 --> 00:31:21,300
Read the newspapers, by which I mean the underground newspapers.

444
00:31:21,300 --> 00:31:25,540
The only ones that are really telling the truth about this goddamn polar vortex that

445
00:31:25,540 --> 00:31:27,060
seems, oh, it's such an oddity.

446
00:31:27,060 --> 00:31:28,900
We never get these polar vortexes.

447
00:31:28,900 --> 00:31:32,340
Is that, cause it feels like we get them about every six months now.

448
00:31:32,340 --> 00:31:33,860
So just read the literature.

449
00:31:33,860 --> 00:31:34,420
You have a fucking point.

450
00:31:34,420 --> 00:31:36,180
What were we doing?

451
00:31:36,740 --> 00:31:40,340
$35, $35,000 worth of snacks from nature box.

452
00:31:40,900 --> 00:31:42,580
So face it.

453
00:31:42,580 --> 00:31:44,740
Oh, I need, I need $35,000.

454
00:31:44,740 --> 00:31:45,300
That's right.

455
00:31:46,580 --> 00:31:53,620
So maybe you need $35,000 to hoard or maybe you need $35,000 to fix your home.

456
00:31:53,620 --> 00:31:59,060
Or maybe you need some money to go back to school or maybe you need to get car repairs

457
00:31:59,060 --> 00:32:02,340
that you can't afford or dental work or medical bills.

458
00:32:02,340 --> 00:32:07,060
Well, there's a peer-to-peer lending service called prosper.com that you should check out.

459
00:32:07,060 --> 00:32:11,220
And basically how it works is instead of going to a bank and dealing with all of the bank

460
00:32:11,220 --> 00:32:16,660
interactions and working with people who do not care about you, that old bank smell that

461
00:32:16,660 --> 00:32:20,180
smells like money and greed and those pin chains.

462
00:32:20,180 --> 00:32:21,620
Smells like wet change.

463
00:32:21,620 --> 00:32:28,580
Oh, instead you just go to prosper.com and you put in what you need the loan for and

464
00:32:28,580 --> 00:32:29,460
how much you need.

465
00:32:29,460 --> 00:32:34,660
And then other users of the site decide if they want to invest in your loan or not.

466
00:32:35,300 --> 00:32:40,580
So that way, rather than one location giving you all of that money, it's several different

467
00:32:40,580 --> 00:32:40,980
people.

468
00:32:40,980 --> 00:32:45,860
It's many, many people all contributing into your loan and then you're paying them back.

469
00:32:45,860 --> 00:32:47,220
So it cuts off the middleman.

470
00:32:47,220 --> 00:32:48,740
I mean, that's what banks do anyways.

471
00:32:48,740 --> 00:32:52,660
If you put money into a bank, that money is what goes into other people's loans.

472
00:32:52,660 --> 00:32:54,100
So why not cut out the middleman?

473
00:32:54,660 --> 00:32:55,860
Maybe save a little money.

474
00:32:56,580 --> 00:33:00,020
Yeah, it's basically like the end of It's a Wonderful Life.

475
00:33:00,020 --> 00:33:02,020
Just you don't have to be a good person.

476
00:33:02,020 --> 00:33:02,420
Yeah.

477
00:33:02,420 --> 00:33:07,140
You could actually be, it's the end of It's a Wonderful Life, but even the bad guy from

478
00:33:07,140 --> 00:33:08,580
It's a Wonderful Life can get it.

479
00:33:10,340 --> 00:33:12,900
Nobody knows what kind of person you are on the internet.

480
00:33:12,900 --> 00:33:13,380
Bad.

481
00:33:13,380 --> 00:33:14,740
If you're on the internet, you're a bad person.

482
00:33:14,740 --> 00:33:18,660
If you want to go check your rate and see if you would qualify for a low rate, you can

483
00:33:18,660 --> 00:33:21,380
do so instantly without affecting your good credit.

484
00:33:21,380 --> 00:33:24,820
If you just go to prosper.com slash my brother and check your rate.

485
00:33:24,820 --> 00:33:29,780
And also right now, listeners of this show, if you get a loan through prosper.com, you'll

486
00:33:29,780 --> 00:33:34,740
automatically get a free $50 visa gift card that you can use in any way you want to.

487
00:33:34,740 --> 00:33:39,140
So on top of the loan you're getting, you're also just getting $50 that you'll never have

488
00:33:39,140 --> 00:33:39,620
to pay back.

489
00:33:39,620 --> 00:33:40,820
And that's just free money.

490
00:33:40,820 --> 00:33:46,180
And in America, that free money is better than, I don't know, seeing your principal

491
00:33:46,180 --> 00:33:47,140
buy beer.

492
00:33:47,140 --> 00:33:52,260
You can buy your principal two cubes of beast with that kind of scratch.

493
00:33:52,980 --> 00:33:53,700
At least.

494
00:33:54,340 --> 00:33:59,220
If you find it on sale, like a Black Friday beast sale, which I assume happens.

495
00:33:59,220 --> 00:33:59,700
Cool.

496
00:33:59,700 --> 00:34:01,700
Cool day after Thanksgiving plans.

497
00:34:01,700 --> 00:34:02,660
Other restrictions apply.

498
00:34:02,660 --> 00:34:04,820
See site for programming visa prepaid card details.

499
00:34:04,820 --> 00:34:06,260
All personal loans are made by what bank?

500
00:34:06,260 --> 00:34:09,700
Utah chartered industrial bank member, FDIC, equal opportunity lender.

501
00:34:09,700 --> 00:34:10,200
Booyah.

502
00:34:10,200 --> 00:34:17,160
Uh, I got a message for Blair and it's from, get this, a lice.

503
00:34:17,160 --> 00:34:19,160
I guess it's like a lice bug.

504
00:34:19,160 --> 00:34:20,440
Did you like that joke?

505
00:34:21,080 --> 00:34:24,040
Griffin, I'm the dad on the show.

506
00:34:24,040 --> 00:34:28,600
I wish we could just get a fucking focus group to do one of our episodes for us live and

507
00:34:28,600 --> 00:34:34,280
just tell us what jokes are amazing and which jokes are just pretty good.

508
00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:34,920
Like that one.

509
00:34:34,920 --> 00:34:40,280
Dear Blair, you deserve to hear how awesome you are from as many people as possible.

510
00:34:40,280 --> 00:34:44,040
So why not three count them three McElroy's?

511
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:49,000
I am always impressed by your strength of character and your devotion to the people

512
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:50,120
and things that you love.

513
00:34:50,120 --> 00:34:53,080
You're a total badass and should never, ever doubt it.

514
00:34:53,080 --> 00:34:54,440
I love you big sister.

515
00:34:55,160 --> 00:34:57,320
Don't ever stop being a beautiful.

516
00:34:57,320 --> 00:34:59,000
Oh, hold the goddamn shit.

517
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:02,760
That's like the Twilight Twilight zoned.

518
00:35:02,760 --> 00:35:05,640
Yeah, you really flipped it on us there at the end.

519
00:35:05,640 --> 00:35:09,960
I got to say, Alice, this is a very sweet message that you've given to your big sister

520
00:35:09,960 --> 00:35:14,520
Blair, but it's going to fall on deaf ears, which is to say no ears cause she's a tree.

521
00:35:14,520 --> 00:35:16,360
She's a tree Shyamalan.

522
00:35:16,360 --> 00:35:17,480
Unless she's like an ent.

523
00:35:18,040 --> 00:35:19,080
Oh my God.

524
00:35:19,080 --> 00:35:24,440
What if she's a proto ent and you play the message for her and a little bit of sap comes

525
00:35:24,440 --> 00:35:26,680
out of where her eye holes would be.

526
00:35:26,680 --> 00:35:30,840
Chelsea Handler vehicle, my sister, the ent only lasted three episodes.

527
00:35:30,840 --> 00:35:32,840
And I think that is a crying shame.

528
00:35:32,840 --> 00:35:33,800
She deserved better.

529
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:38,440
Carla got a message for you coming from Dan.

530
00:35:39,560 --> 00:35:41,720
What does Dan have to say, Trev?

531
00:35:41,720 --> 00:35:44,600
Dan says the past three years have been the best of my life.

532
00:35:44,600 --> 00:35:48,680
Even during the parts with all the problems, you made me want to be a better me and gave

533
00:35:48,680 --> 00:35:51,000
me a whole new appreciation for finding Nemo.

534
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:51,640
I love you.

535
00:35:51,640 --> 00:35:56,280
And I look forward to many years of mutual love and one true football too many years

536
00:35:56,280 --> 00:35:58,600
of mutual love of the one true football.

537
00:35:58,600 --> 00:35:59,400
I made it better.

538
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:00,360
I don't think you did.

539
00:36:00,360 --> 00:36:03,000
I think he broke it with my, with my accidental words.

540
00:36:04,600 --> 00:36:06,280
These are like both really nice.

541
00:36:06,280 --> 00:36:09,160
It is, but I'm so now unaccustomed.

542
00:36:09,160 --> 00:36:11,960
I'm so much more used to hit me up on my mobile.

543
00:36:11,960 --> 00:36:14,120
Yeah, which is fine, which is great.

544
00:36:14,120 --> 00:36:14,600
It's fine.

545
00:36:15,480 --> 00:36:19,160
I, but again, this one has like a twist mystery at the end of twistery, doesn't it?

546
00:36:19,160 --> 00:36:19,960
They're at the end.

547
00:36:19,960 --> 00:36:24,920
Cause it's Dan, a football football.

548
00:36:25,720 --> 00:36:28,280
I don't think they have a pet football.

549
00:36:28,280 --> 00:36:30,680
Maybe the two of them together love a football.

550
00:36:30,680 --> 00:36:34,920
Maybe they're both footballs in which case, who sent this message in?

551
00:36:34,920 --> 00:36:37,400
It's a twister, it's a twistery.

552
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:39,800
Griffin, really, if you think about it, aren't we all footballs?

553
00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:41,240
Ooh, wait, let me check.

554
00:36:41,240 --> 00:36:42,600
Wait, I don't have arms and legs.

555
00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:44,040
I'm all leathery and laced up.

556
00:36:44,040 --> 00:36:45,720
It's a twistery.

557
00:36:45,720 --> 00:36:49,240
What if God was a football?

558
00:36:49,240 --> 00:36:53,160
Delicious, delicious twistery.

559
00:36:53,160 --> 00:36:56,040
We can only see out our eyes.

560
00:36:56,040 --> 00:36:58,600
We can't look down at our hands.

561
00:36:58,600 --> 00:37:03,400
So we could have been footballs all the time.

562
00:37:03,400 --> 00:37:05,960
Oh, but Bruce Willis is the only non football.

563
00:37:05,960 --> 00:37:07,240
Oh my God.

564
00:37:07,240 --> 00:37:10,040
And if you really look back over the movie, the clues were all there.

565
00:37:10,040 --> 00:37:11,800
Cause he's not made of leather.

566
00:37:11,800 --> 00:37:13,880
Cause all the characters were footballs.

567
00:37:13,880 --> 00:37:18,440
Haley Joel Osment actually kind of looks like a football now.

568
00:37:18,440 --> 00:37:20,760
I don't know if you've seen him lately.

569
00:37:20,760 --> 00:37:21,240
Come on.

570
00:37:21,240 --> 00:37:23,000
He's a, I love, it's a good look.

571
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:25,160
I think a football is the most handsome of all the balls.

572
00:37:25,160 --> 00:37:27,160
He's like a living Hey Arnold.

573
00:37:27,160 --> 00:37:27,800
That's what it looks like.

574
00:37:27,800 --> 00:37:28,280
No.

575
00:37:28,280 --> 00:37:29,160
Hey.

576
00:37:29,160 --> 00:37:31,240
I meant like vertically oriented.

577
00:37:31,240 --> 00:37:33,000
I'm never going to get him on the show now.

578
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:33,400
Damn it.

579
00:37:35,480 --> 00:37:37,320
Hey, feeling lonely?

580
00:37:37,320 --> 00:37:38,840
My name's Jesse Thorn.

581
00:37:38,840 --> 00:37:40,840
My name's Jordan Morris.

582
00:37:40,840 --> 00:37:46,840
Do you want to listen to a program where two good friends get intimate with amazing guests

583
00:37:46,840 --> 00:37:52,840
like Maria Bamford, Rob Corddry, and other comedy superstars?

584
00:37:52,840 --> 00:37:55,880
Jordan Jesse Coe is here for you every week.

585
00:37:55,880 --> 00:37:59,560
We'll spill our guts for you and then make some jokes.

586
00:37:59,560 --> 00:38:03,320
Jordan Jesse Coe free at maximum fun.org.

587
00:38:04,840 --> 00:38:09,000
My boyfriend and I have been together for 25 years and live 2.5 years.

588
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:09,800
Holy shit.

589
00:38:10,680 --> 00:38:12,840
My Travis read it.

590
00:38:12,840 --> 00:38:13,240
I'm done.

591
00:38:13,240 --> 00:38:13,720
I'm at the game.

592
00:38:13,720 --> 00:38:18,200
My boyfriend and I have been together for 2.5 years and living together for the last year.

593
00:38:18,200 --> 00:38:18,600
Lately.

594
00:38:18,600 --> 00:38:20,200
I feel like we have grown apart.

595
00:38:20,200 --> 00:38:22,600
What is the least shitty way to break up with someone?

596
00:38:22,600 --> 00:38:23,080
God, it's tough.

597
00:38:23,080 --> 00:38:25,400
And that's from It's Not Me, It's Utah.

598
00:38:25,400 --> 00:38:27,960
That's an amazing choice for our comedy show.

599
00:38:27,960 --> 00:38:31,800
Pretty great Saturday morning cartoon here for us.

600
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:36,040
Listen, it's a topic we haven't covered and I feel like there's a lot of help to give here.

601
00:38:36,600 --> 00:38:39,080
You know what the least shitty way is?

602
00:38:39,080 --> 00:38:41,960
The least shitty way for the other person.

603
00:38:41,960 --> 00:38:47,240
Not for you because that's what's fucked up is it is an inverse relationship.

604
00:38:47,240 --> 00:38:50,520
The more shitty it is for you, the less shitty it is for them.

605
00:38:50,520 --> 00:38:54,120
And so if you want to actually do this and you want to do it right,

606
00:38:54,120 --> 00:38:56,760
it's going to be fucking miserable for you.

607
00:38:56,760 --> 00:38:58,440
You have to fake your own death.

608
00:38:58,440 --> 00:39:01,720
No, that's no, that's the least shitty way for you.

609
00:39:02,840 --> 00:39:04,680
I think that's pretty good.

610
00:39:04,680 --> 00:39:10,440
No, I mean, the least shitty way for the other person is direct and like honest and just say,

611
00:39:10,440 --> 00:39:14,360
like, hey, I don't think, you know, it's changed and I don't feel the same way.

612
00:39:14,360 --> 00:39:18,600
And then you have to just like sit there and take whatever they fucking take it.

613
00:39:18,600 --> 00:39:27,560
It open your jaw and swallow, swallow all the anger or sadness or pain in their eyes or whatever.

614
00:39:27,560 --> 00:39:31,480
And then you also, if you're the instigator, you've got to deal with a lot more fallout

615
00:39:31,480 --> 00:39:35,000
from like your friends and neighbors and all of those people that, you know,

616
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:37,320
in town that have gotten to know you guys as a couple.

617
00:39:37,320 --> 00:39:39,720
And you share a lot of stuff because you live together.

618
00:39:39,720 --> 00:39:41,080
And I'm not telling you not to do it.

619
00:39:41,080 --> 00:39:44,520
I'm just saying as the instigator, it's usually a lot more.

620
00:39:44,520 --> 00:39:54,440
Sucks ass. I, the thing that I think I learned during like my dating career was that like,

621
00:39:54,440 --> 00:40:00,280
don't, don't, don't check out so much before you break up with the person that all you can

622
00:40:00,280 --> 00:40:04,440
think about is how fucking sweet it's going to be after you don't have this horrible thing

623
00:40:04,440 --> 00:40:05,720
in front of you anymore.

624
00:40:05,720 --> 00:40:09,880
If you don't treat this thing with the respect that like the length of your relationship,

625
00:40:09,880 --> 00:40:15,080
like the, the amount of credit that that has earned with you, like if you, if you don't keep

626
00:40:15,080 --> 00:40:21,080
in mind like how much time and energy the, both of you have put into this thing while

627
00:40:21,080 --> 00:40:25,640
considering your options for how to break up with the person, you are doing both of you

628
00:40:25,640 --> 00:40:27,800
a fucking enormous disservice.

629
00:40:28,600 --> 00:40:32,360
The grown apart is like the worst way of breaking up.

630
00:40:32,360 --> 00:40:37,400
Like that's the, cause they may come out an absolute clear blue sky for the other person,

631
00:40:37,400 --> 00:40:39,960
like no clue.

632
00:40:39,960 --> 00:40:45,720
Or I would say the other, other side of that coin is if you hesitate and you like if right

633
00:40:45,720 --> 00:40:50,200
now this second, you know, it's not working and you are mentally ready to break up with

634
00:40:50,200 --> 00:40:54,520
them and then you put it off for like a couple of weeks because you're not ready to actually

635
00:40:54,520 --> 00:41:00,280
do it yet and then your behavior changes, your attitude towards them change and it just

636
00:41:00,280 --> 00:41:02,200
is hell for the next four weeks.

637
00:41:02,200 --> 00:41:05,720
Trav, could you use that time to start seeding it though?

638
00:41:05,720 --> 00:41:11,160
So it's not such a complete, like could you start saying things like, ah, I could use

639
00:41:11,160 --> 00:41:12,680
some more space.

640
00:41:12,680 --> 00:41:16,120
Or like, do you want to rent the Jennifer Aniston movie The Breakup again?

641
00:41:16,120 --> 00:41:23,560
No, guys, cause, cause that's just, that's just a way of making, of, of spreading the

642
00:41:23,560 --> 00:41:25,720
worstness out, you know what I mean?

643
00:41:25,720 --> 00:41:31,560
It's not going to be less shitty for this person to get dumped if they just do it all

644
00:41:31,560 --> 00:41:36,760
at once, it's going to be, it's going to be more, way more shitty for them to see it coming,

645
00:41:36,760 --> 00:41:42,040
to have this like nice thing, like sort of go sour and then ultimately when it ends,

646
00:41:42,040 --> 00:41:43,800
like it's going to hurt just as much anyway.

647
00:41:43,800 --> 00:41:52,280
Have, have you guys, here's a question for you, have you been dumped or dumped more?

648
00:41:52,280 --> 00:41:53,560
What has happened to you more?

649
00:41:53,560 --> 00:41:55,560
Have you been the dumper or the dumpee more?

650
00:41:55,560 --> 00:41:57,000
I have been dumped more.

651
00:41:58,120 --> 00:41:58,680
Okay.

652
00:41:58,680 --> 00:41:59,160
Griffin?

653
00:41:59,160 --> 00:42:04,280
Uh, Justin, this is a fucking trap because I, it's going to make me sound like a douche

654
00:42:04,280 --> 00:42:07,800
because I've dumped, I've definitely dumped, dumped Ed more.

655
00:42:07,800 --> 00:42:09,320
I, I got really bad.

656
00:42:09,320 --> 00:42:14,440
We have a great, we have a great representation here because I'm right, right in the middle.

657
00:42:14,440 --> 00:42:15,560
He split the uprights.

658
00:42:15,560 --> 00:42:16,840
One, one and one.

659
00:42:17,880 --> 00:42:18,760
I, one and one.

660
00:42:18,760 --> 00:42:25,880
I got to, my problem was a, especially like in college that I would usually, if I was

661
00:42:25,880 --> 00:42:30,440
not, no longer interested in continuing the relationship, would just kind of act like

662
00:42:30,440 --> 00:42:33,080
a jerk until it ended so that I wouldn't have to do it.

663
00:42:34,200 --> 00:42:34,520
You know what I mean?

664
00:42:34,520 --> 00:42:38,360
I don't need to, uh, amend.

665
00:42:38,920 --> 00:42:47,400
I have dumped more and the one extra that I had forgotten about, sorry, madam, uh, uh,

666
00:42:47,400 --> 00:42:49,720
I told I was moving soon.

667
00:42:50,520 --> 00:42:52,280
I was moving soon.

668
00:42:52,280 --> 00:42:57,480
And I couldn't pursue a relationship because I was moving so that's weird because I feel

669
00:42:57,480 --> 00:42:59,560
like you've lived in Huntington basically your whole life.

670
00:42:59,560 --> 00:43:03,160
I didn't end up going through with the move.

671
00:43:03,160 --> 00:43:03,480
Okay.

672
00:43:03,480 --> 00:43:07,640
Wait, no, at the time, were you honestly planning to move and change your mind?

673
00:43:08,120 --> 00:43:08,840
I was young.

674
00:43:08,840 --> 00:43:12,680
I had a lot of options in front of me, so I mean, hell, I don't know.

675
00:43:12,680 --> 00:43:14,120
It's a big wide world out there.

676
00:43:14,120 --> 00:43:16,520
It was potential energy that brought that.

677
00:43:16,520 --> 00:43:17,000
Right.

678
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:19,880
Um, no, it's, I, I, here's the thing.

679
00:43:19,880 --> 00:43:21,880
Here's the thing I feel.

680
00:43:22,920 --> 00:43:23,960
Oh God.

681
00:43:23,960 --> 00:43:27,800
Whenever I got dumped, it was always sudden out of the clear blue sky.

682
00:43:28,440 --> 00:43:32,600
And whenever I dumped, it was, I would always just let it fucking fester like this.

683
00:43:32,600 --> 00:43:35,080
And that's why I got to feel like you can't do it.

684
00:43:35,080 --> 00:43:36,600
It's like an infected limb.

685
00:43:37,160 --> 00:43:37,480
Yeah.

686
00:43:37,480 --> 00:43:39,880
It's, it's, it's, it's really, really horrible.

687
00:43:39,880 --> 00:43:48,920
I think also, can we just agree as a fucking nation as a world ground rules, nothing with

688
00:43:48,920 --> 00:43:54,280
written words, no emails, no God damn texts, no AI Ms.

689
00:43:54,280 --> 00:43:56,840
Nobody wants to, we're done.

690
00:43:57,560 --> 00:43:59,240
That's the sound of the instant message.

691
00:43:59,240 --> 00:44:03,720
And, and as comforting as you feel like or protective, don't like go out to a restaurant

692
00:44:03,720 --> 00:44:05,320
and dump somebody in a restaurant.

693
00:44:05,960 --> 00:44:06,840
Like do it.

694
00:44:06,840 --> 00:44:10,840
Unless you like, I don't know, unless you need a safe space to do it.

695
00:44:10,840 --> 00:44:11,640
Well, that's true.

696
00:44:11,640 --> 00:44:15,240
It's just like, uh, is there a place you could do it?

697
00:44:15,240 --> 00:44:15,640
Okay.

698
00:44:15,640 --> 00:44:15,880
Okay.

699
00:44:15,880 --> 00:44:16,120
Okay.

700
00:44:16,120 --> 00:44:16,280
Okay.

701
00:44:16,280 --> 00:44:17,080
Okay.

702
00:44:17,080 --> 00:44:21,720
Is there a place that you could dump someone, a place or a time or whatever?

703
00:44:21,720 --> 00:44:26,120
Is there a place where you could dump someone where they might be able to, because of the

704
00:44:26,120 --> 00:44:33,720
place they are in could like convert it to where they can almost instantly get over it?

705
00:44:33,720 --> 00:44:35,160
Dave and Buster's.

706
00:44:35,160 --> 00:44:37,320
That's what Dave and Buster's is for.

707
00:44:37,320 --> 00:44:38,440
Oh man, that sucks.

708
00:44:38,440 --> 00:44:44,440
Let me get an onion ring tower and oh my God, you guys have a, a fisherman's bait here.

709
00:44:44,440 --> 00:44:45,240
This is going to be great.

710
00:44:45,240 --> 00:44:48,600
I'm going to go, I'm going to eat this onion ring tower and then I'm going to go play

711
00:44:48,600 --> 00:44:51,000
that a deep sea shooter game that Sega made.

712
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:55,000
Griffin, you write about video games for a living and it took you 10 seconds to pull

713
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:55,960
an arcade game.

714
00:44:55,960 --> 00:44:56,600
I'm so disappointed.

715
00:44:56,600 --> 00:44:58,520
And your pole was fisherman's bait.

716
00:44:58,520 --> 00:44:59,720
Oh, I'm so frustrated.

717
00:44:59,720 --> 00:45:02,760
I'm going to go play Silent Scope and then they go play Silent Scope and then they're

718
00:45:02,760 --> 00:45:03,080
fine.

719
00:45:03,080 --> 00:45:05,640
And they won enough tickets to get a new girlfriend.

720
00:45:09,640 --> 00:45:11,000
That is not how that works.

721
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:12,120
Oh God.

722
00:45:12,120 --> 00:45:14,120
Is a phone, can we establish it?

723
00:45:14,120 --> 00:45:21,240
As long as we're fucking writing up the articles of confederation here is, is a phone call.

724
00:45:21,240 --> 00:45:21,960
Okay.

725
00:45:21,960 --> 00:45:28,280
Within two months, if you've only been dating two months, but two and a half years and you're

726
00:45:28,280 --> 00:45:30,680
living together, that's not a phone call.

727
00:45:32,040 --> 00:45:33,560
I recused myself from the question.

728
00:45:33,560 --> 00:45:34,360
Okay.

729
00:45:34,360 --> 00:45:34,600
Yeah.

730
00:45:35,160 --> 00:45:42,600
Oh, that was kind of my jam, but it was also my jam because it was like situations like

731
00:45:42,600 --> 00:45:47,320
this where it was, where it was like, oh, we've grown very, very far apart and we both

732
00:45:47,320 --> 00:45:48,680
kind of know this thing is coming.

733
00:45:48,680 --> 00:45:54,200
That's the other thing, like that is another dynamic entirely of if both of you think this

734
00:45:54,200 --> 00:45:59,960
thing is about to like come crashing down, then it's almost like a relief to end it.

735
00:45:59,960 --> 00:46:00,520
You know what I mean?

736
00:46:00,520 --> 00:46:03,640
Cause we don't know how, we don't know how your boyfriend feels.

737
00:46:04,200 --> 00:46:09,640
If your boyfriend is like in the same boat as you, then maybe the breakup won't be as

738
00:46:09,640 --> 00:46:14,280
like, I mean, it'll be very, very sad, but maybe it won't be as like hyper painful.

739
00:46:14,280 --> 00:46:16,680
Maybe it'll be a relief to some degree.

740
00:46:16,680 --> 00:46:16,920
Right.

741
00:46:16,920 --> 00:46:22,040
I think, I think when a bad relationship ends that both people are unhappy with when that

742
00:46:22,040 --> 00:46:24,840
ends, that is a good thing for everybody involved.

743
00:46:26,600 --> 00:46:32,840
And, and it will suck for, I mean, no matter what, like even if you have grown apart, but

744
00:46:32,840 --> 00:46:34,120
like that's the nature of it.

745
00:46:34,120 --> 00:46:35,480
That's the nature of the beast.

746
00:46:35,480 --> 00:46:36,840
So just do it.

747
00:46:36,840 --> 00:46:42,440
Make, can I make a recommendation though, please, please try to have your shit boxed

748
00:46:42,440 --> 00:46:47,480
up, please try to be a little bit prepared for what's going to happen next because one

749
00:46:47,480 --> 00:46:51,000
of you is going to have to a carry that lease by yourself.

750
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:54,360
You're going to pay the rent by yourself and the other one's going to have to move.

751
00:46:54,360 --> 00:46:56,360
Like please have an eggs fill.

752
00:46:57,800 --> 00:47:01,480
I've had friends that have been living with people and broken up like three months into

753
00:47:01,480 --> 00:47:08,840
a year long lease and then have continued like living under the same roof, but as exes

754
00:47:08,840 --> 00:47:11,480
because neither one could screw the other.

755
00:47:11,480 --> 00:47:14,520
It's just sounds like the most purgatorial shit.

756
00:47:15,400 --> 00:47:22,600
Could you like, could that be, could you like use that to transition into like being okay

757
00:47:22,600 --> 00:47:23,080
with it?

758
00:47:23,080 --> 00:47:24,440
Could you use that for closure?

759
00:47:24,440 --> 00:47:25,240
Is that possible?

760
00:47:25,240 --> 00:47:27,560
Has anyone ever successfully done that?

761
00:47:27,560 --> 00:47:28,520
Nobody ever.

762
00:47:28,520 --> 00:47:32,520
No, because the problem is like even if it's like a two bedroom house and you're living

763
00:47:32,520 --> 00:47:34,360
in separate rooms, like what are you supposed to do?

764
00:47:34,360 --> 00:47:35,240
Start dating again?

765
00:47:35,800 --> 00:47:39,800
Like, or then you're still just hanging out all the time.

766
00:47:39,800 --> 00:47:41,000
I guess it worked on new girl.

767
00:47:42,440 --> 00:47:45,160
Spoilers, you guys want to Yahoo?

768
00:47:46,280 --> 00:47:46,440
Yeah.

769
00:47:50,600 --> 00:47:52,680
This Yahoo was sent in by level 44.

770
00:47:53,880 --> 00:47:56,520
Yahoo shaman drew Davenport.

771
00:47:56,520 --> 00:47:57,240
Thank you, Drew.

772
00:47:57,240 --> 00:47:59,080
It's by Yahoo, Drew answers users.

773
00:47:59,080 --> 00:48:08,360
Christian, a member since July 22nd, 2013, an aged veteran who asks, reaching for a dollar?

774
00:48:10,120 --> 00:48:13,000
Someone bent down to pick up a dollar outside the pharmacy.

775
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:16,360
She almost had it when I stopped on it and picked it up.

776
00:48:16,920 --> 00:48:19,320
I scared her badly and I feel bad.

777
00:48:19,320 --> 00:48:23,000
I apologize for scaring her, but she still looks confused.

778
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:24,520
Should I have apologized more?

779
00:48:24,520 --> 00:48:28,440
Or so this is just as hard as the last question.

780
00:48:28,440 --> 00:48:32,520
I feel like, okay, wait, break it down for me again.

781
00:48:33,320 --> 00:48:33,880
Okay.

782
00:48:33,880 --> 00:48:37,160
Someone been down and pick up a dollar outside of the pharmacy.

783
00:48:37,160 --> 00:48:42,280
Oh, she almost had it, but then this person stomped on it and picked it up.

784
00:48:42,280 --> 00:48:43,320
That is okay.

785
00:48:44,120 --> 00:48:46,440
Again, game recognize game.

786
00:48:46,440 --> 00:48:51,800
That is good dollar pickup strategy because if someone's getting the old fishing line,

787
00:48:51,800 --> 00:48:52,840
you're not going anywhere.

788
00:48:52,840 --> 00:48:56,440
You fucking Washington get you.

789
00:48:56,440 --> 00:49:00,120
Do you think that this question asked her like watched and watches like, oh, she's almost

790
00:49:00,120 --> 00:49:00,600
got it.

791
00:49:00,600 --> 00:49:01,000
Okay.

792
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:04,760
And then left 45 feet into the air.

793
00:49:04,760 --> 00:49:05,320
Not today.

794
00:49:05,320 --> 00:49:10,280
Grandma went super saying and then butt stomped right down on this dollar bill.

795
00:49:10,920 --> 00:49:14,680
You were probably thinking about using that dollar bill to buy your, your grandson some

796
00:49:14,680 --> 00:49:17,080
candy for pills.

797
00:49:20,120 --> 00:49:20,280
Okay.

798
00:49:20,280 --> 00:49:22,440
If you guys see a dollar on the ground, you've been to pick it up, right?

799
00:49:22,440 --> 00:49:22,840
No.

800
00:49:22,840 --> 00:49:26,440
And what, what, what denomination, what, how, what denomination?

801
00:49:26,440 --> 00:49:27,000
I'm sorry.

802
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:27,800
I said a dollar.

803
00:49:27,800 --> 00:49:30,040
So a dollar won a single dollar bill.

804
00:49:30,040 --> 00:49:32,280
Are you fucking kidding me with my back?

805
00:49:33,880 --> 00:49:36,120
That's why I keep, I keep my grabber arm with me.

806
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:42,280
If you see a 50 outside of a business, do you take it into the business to say like,

807
00:49:42,280 --> 00:49:43,480
Hey, I found this outside.

808
00:49:43,480 --> 00:49:48,360
So if, in case someone comes looking for it, just like the, the legendary drakul, it all

809
00:49:48,360 --> 00:49:50,200
depends on the threshold.

810
00:49:50,200 --> 00:49:52,760
If it is outside, it is fair game.

811
00:49:52,760 --> 00:49:53,240
Yeah.

812
00:49:53,240 --> 00:49:56,520
If it's inside, it's fair game for a 50.

813
00:49:56,520 --> 00:49:59,640
I would fight everybody around me in a 100 foot radius.

814
00:49:59,640 --> 00:50:02,600
Like, and I was in fucking battle Royale.

815
00:50:02,600 --> 00:50:04,760
I would fight everyone for that shit.

816
00:50:04,760 --> 00:50:09,720
It would be like the opening scene in on Bach, just like me fucking climbing a tree to get

817
00:50:09,720 --> 00:50:12,520
to the $50 bill on top, just like kicking dudes to the ground.

818
00:50:13,160 --> 00:50:14,200
No way.

819
00:50:14,200 --> 00:50:16,280
$50 bill, 10 more dollars.

820
00:50:16,280 --> 00:50:18,200
I can buy a new AAA video game.

821
00:50:18,200 --> 00:50:19,800
Fuck off.

822
00:50:22,520 --> 00:50:24,120
But see, that's the thing though.

823
00:50:24,120 --> 00:50:27,960
I don't bend over for a single, but if I did 50 times.

824
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:35,240
The reason I wanted us to address this question is because I feel like it, it, it, it tackles

825
00:50:35,240 --> 00:50:41,240
a lot of really tough subjects like embarrassing yourself by taking, bending over to pick up

826
00:50:41,240 --> 00:50:42,040
garbage off the ground.

827
00:50:42,040 --> 00:50:42,760
Cause that's what it is.

828
00:50:44,600 --> 00:50:45,800
Thievery potentially.

829
00:50:45,800 --> 00:50:47,320
Cause that might be somebody else's dollar.

830
00:50:47,320 --> 00:50:50,200
It might be this person's dollar that they literally just dropped.

831
00:50:50,200 --> 00:50:54,680
And you were standing behind this person, tailing them, waiting for them to drop currency.

832
00:50:54,680 --> 00:50:56,840
And then when they did, you swooped it.

833
00:50:56,840 --> 00:51:01,880
I think my favorite part of this question is the question askers like confusion at the

834
00:51:01,880 --> 00:51:03,800
other person's confusion.

835
00:51:03,800 --> 00:51:05,320
Like why would they be confused?

836
00:51:05,320 --> 00:51:07,560
Well, because like you waited until they almost had it.

837
00:51:07,560 --> 00:51:09,320
And then you stomped your foot down on it.

838
00:51:09,320 --> 00:51:13,720
You followed this person for seven blocks and they were like, whoops.

839
00:51:13,720 --> 00:51:15,320
And you were like mine.

840
00:51:15,320 --> 00:51:20,920
And then they were admittedly confused and they were confused because they had never

841
00:51:20,920 --> 00:51:23,640
seen a fucking bridge troll in their life before.

842
00:51:25,640 --> 00:51:28,440
I, uh, you guys throw pennies on the ground.

843
00:51:28,440 --> 00:51:29,000
Oh God.

844
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:29,560
Yeah.

845
00:51:29,560 --> 00:51:36,840
When we were in Japan, we, uh, I racked up a lot of one yen coins and I don't know if

846
00:51:36,840 --> 00:51:42,840
you guys know how the, how the yen works, but it's basically 100 of those equals $1.

847
00:51:42,840 --> 00:51:48,840
So one yen, the coins are like made out of like play school, like plastic.

848
00:51:48,840 --> 00:51:50,440
They're the shittiest, worst coins.

849
00:51:50,440 --> 00:51:53,720
And I racked up like 700 of them while we were there.

850
00:51:53,720 --> 00:52:00,040
And I literally, the day we left, I put them all in a can and I threw the can away, threw

851
00:52:00,040 --> 00:52:04,360
it right in the garbage because like nobody takes them.

852
00:52:04,360 --> 00:52:05,400
Nobody wants those.

853
00:52:05,400 --> 00:52:12,520
I had a friend that I learned in middle school, actually, uh, who, who hated pennies and he

854
00:52:12,520 --> 00:52:14,920
would throw them like on the ground.

855
00:52:14,920 --> 00:52:18,920
If he got a penny, he would just like chuck it and, and, and lose it.

856
00:52:18,920 --> 00:52:20,440
He lived with his grandparents.

857
00:52:20,440 --> 00:52:28,200
And one day we were almost out of middle school, his grandfather presents this jar where he

858
00:52:28,200 --> 00:52:31,480
had been picking up these pennies and like collecting them.

859
00:52:31,480 --> 00:52:36,680
And he had like a sizable chunk of change and he was basically taunting my friend, Mark,

860
00:52:36,680 --> 00:52:40,120
because he had collected these riches off of him.

861
00:52:40,120 --> 00:52:45,240
He had like scrimped and saved and then had like a good 650 in a jar.

862
00:52:45,240 --> 00:52:52,280
Hold on, hold on, hold on, his $6 and 50 cents or $650, $6 and 50 cents.

863
00:52:52,280 --> 00:52:54,760
But keep in mind, of course, this was the eighties.

864
00:52:54,760 --> 00:53:01,240
Okay, but that could still, that could still, that could still, that could still, that could

865
00:53:01,240 --> 00:53:06,760
pull out to 650 zero, $6,500.

866
00:53:06,760 --> 00:53:10,040
And I still think all the work that went into picking up those pennies probably wasn't

867
00:53:10,040 --> 00:53:11,040
worth it.

868
00:53:11,040 --> 00:53:13,760
Peepers, Peepers, your back is so shitty.

869
00:53:13,760 --> 00:53:17,360
How did your back get so wildly shitty, Peepers?

870
00:53:17,360 --> 00:53:19,480
I just picked up $6 and 50 cents.

871
00:53:19,480 --> 00:53:21,560
That'll pay for my back surgery, won't it?

872
00:53:21,560 --> 00:53:22,920
No, it won't.

873
00:53:22,920 --> 00:53:27,480
Try adding another $14,994 to that.

874
00:53:27,480 --> 00:53:30,220
And then we can probably talk about back surgery.

875
00:53:30,220 --> 00:53:33,400
You fool.

876
00:53:33,400 --> 00:53:36,640
I can't believe we won the great war.

877
00:53:36,640 --> 00:53:37,640
With you.

878
00:53:37,640 --> 00:53:40,640
With you and your ilk.

879
00:53:40,640 --> 00:53:43,320
Thanks everybody so much for listening to our program.

880
00:53:43,320 --> 00:53:46,560
We hope you've had a lot of fun.

881
00:53:46,560 --> 00:53:55,760
Want to let you know we're going to be doing a live, a live broadcast of our, of our program.

882
00:53:55,760 --> 00:53:58,200
My brother, my brother and me.

883
00:53:58,200 --> 00:53:59,200
Home for the candle nights.

884
00:53:59,200 --> 00:54:00,200
A holiday spectacular.

885
00:54:00,200 --> 00:54:01,920
We're going to be in Huntington, West Virginia.

886
00:54:01,920 --> 00:54:08,520
We have sold 430 tickets, believe it or not.

887
00:54:08,520 --> 00:54:11,200
And we want you to be there.

888
00:54:11,200 --> 00:54:15,600
Travis, you made a bit.ly link, but I can't seem to scrounge it up.

889
00:54:15,600 --> 00:54:17,320
Do you remember what it was?

890
00:54:17,320 --> 00:54:20,600
It is bit.ly forward slash candle nights live.

891
00:54:20,600 --> 00:54:21,600
Okay.

892
00:54:21,600 --> 00:54:23,820
Bit.ly forward slash candle nights live.

893
00:54:23,820 --> 00:54:27,760
And you're going to be able to, uh, to go see that show.

894
00:54:27,760 --> 00:54:29,960
Now maybe you're thinking, Hey, I don't live near West Virginia.

895
00:54:29,960 --> 00:54:31,080
I can't do that.

896
00:54:31,080 --> 00:54:34,360
Let me tell you some of the places where we have sold tickets.

897
00:54:34,360 --> 00:54:41,200
We've sold 12 in Tennessee, 23 in Virginia, 38 in Pennsylvania, 15 from North Carolina,

898
00:54:41,200 --> 00:54:48,800
15 from Maryland, 44 from Kentucky, 18 from Illinois, eight from Georgia, two from Florida,

899
00:54:48,800 --> 00:54:55,400
three from Connecticut, two from Colorado and two from Switzerland.

900
00:54:55,400 --> 00:54:57,920
So I think that probably you can come.

901
00:54:57,920 --> 00:55:02,640
No pressure, but if we don't fucking all three of us turn into mirror balls on the stage

902
00:55:02,640 --> 00:55:07,560
and shoot light out of every pore from our body and hover around 15 feet in the air and

903
00:55:07,560 --> 00:55:13,360
give everybody $5,000, then I don't think that this show is going to be as good as these

904
00:55:13,360 --> 00:55:15,800
Swiss people think it's going to be.

905
00:55:15,800 --> 00:55:20,280
Oh boy, we'll do our best.

906
00:55:20,280 --> 00:55:23,160
If it makes you feel any better after the show, we'll probably get drunk with everyone

907
00:55:23,160 --> 00:55:26,560
and just get like blitzed.

908
00:55:26,560 --> 00:55:30,240
So that might be fun.

909
00:55:30,240 --> 00:55:34,480
So go see that, bit.ly forward slash Candle Nights Live.

910
00:55:34,480 --> 00:55:41,080
I don't know what we're going to do that would live up to how far people are coming, but

911
00:55:41,080 --> 00:55:43,200
it will be popping off.

912
00:55:43,200 --> 00:55:44,760
Yeah, we'll do our best.

913
00:55:44,760 --> 00:55:47,880
We want to hang out afterwards and all that good stuff.

914
00:55:47,880 --> 00:55:55,440
And Sawbones also will be opening, so fans of that program should come too.

915
00:55:55,440 --> 00:55:59,840
I want to say thanks again to Naturebox where you can order great tasting wholesome snacks.

I want to thank John Roderick.

923
00:56:11,040 --> 00:56:13,680
I want to thank John Roderick and the Long Winter's for these for a theme song.

924
00:56:13,680 --> 00:56:16,720
It's a departure off the album, putting the days to bed.

925
00:56:16,720 --> 00:56:20,800
You can listen to that for free at the beginning and end and a little bit in the middle of

926
00:56:20,800 --> 00:56:21,800
our podcast.

927
00:56:21,800 --> 00:56:26,960
So, again, more free shit for you want to thank people tweeting about the show like

930
00:56:42,920 --> 00:56:45,920
Quad likes so many others.

931
00:56:45,920 --> 00:56:50,440
That is actually a YouTube like notification engine.

932
00:56:50,440 --> 00:56:54,760
Speaking of YouTube, we just put up a new animated short from Tyler Crowley and it's

933
00:56:54,760 --> 00:56:55,760
so good.

934
00:56:55,760 --> 00:57:00,040
It's the shitty Iron Man bit, which is like, I don't know about you guys, but that's one

935
00:57:00,040 --> 00:57:02,760
of the funniest things that Griffin has done on the show.

936
00:57:02,760 --> 00:57:03,760
I love his rants.

937
00:57:03,760 --> 00:57:06,480
So if you haven't seen it, go check it out.

938
00:57:06,480 --> 00:57:09,320
We are MBNBAM on YouTube.

939

940
00:57:11,400 --> 00:57:15,000
It's the best way to get new people onto our YouTube channel and to make more videos and

00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:18,760

00:57:18,760 --> 00:57:22,320

This is this is an earnest, please, please, please.

944
00:57:26,800 --> 00:57:27,800
We done?

945
00:57:27,800 --> 00:57:28,800
Yeah.

946
00:57:28,800 --> 00:57:29,800
I think we're done.

947
00:57:29,800 --> 00:57:33,340
That cartoon, by the way, has three thousand, two hundred nine six, which is about a million

948
00:57:33,340 --> 00:57:34,340
two for you.

949
00:57:34,340 --> 00:57:36,960
Let's get Robert Downey Jr. to tweet that and then we're done.

950
00:57:36,960 --> 00:57:37,960
We can retire.

951
00:57:37,960 --> 00:57:40,200
Oh, and check out all the other shows on Max Fonda.

952
00:57:40,200 --> 00:57:41,200
They're incredible.

953
00:57:41,200 --> 00:57:42,200
That goes without saying.

954
00:57:42,200 --> 00:57:43,200
But I assume you're what's our featured show?

955
00:57:43,200 --> 00:57:48,080
Let's say this week's feature show is throwing shade, throwing shade.

956
00:57:48,080 --> 00:57:51,480
A man and a woman.

957
00:57:51,480 --> 00:57:52,560
I'm not sure if they're a couple.

958
00:57:52,560 --> 00:57:55,560
I think they might be a couple.

959
00:57:55,560 --> 00:58:00,480
They talk about women's issues and gay issues.

960
00:58:00,480 --> 00:58:01,920
I'm not sure what gives them the right.

961
00:58:01,920 --> 00:58:03,400
But sure.

962
00:58:03,400 --> 00:58:05,760
And throwing shade is actually really, really, really funny.

963
00:58:05,760 --> 00:58:06,760
It's super good.

964
00:58:06,760 --> 00:58:08,880
If you like this show, you'll like throwing shade.

965
00:58:08,880 --> 00:58:11,160
I know they might be giants or a fan of throwing shade.

966
00:58:11,160 --> 00:58:14,580
