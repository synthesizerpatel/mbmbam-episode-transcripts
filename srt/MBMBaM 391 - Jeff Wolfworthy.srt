1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:30,640
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:47,360
Hello everybody and welcome to my brother, my brother mean advice show for the modern era.

6
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:52,160
I'm your oldest brother Justin McElroy. I'm your middle-est brother Travis McElroy.

7
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:56,160
I'm your sweet baby brother and 30 under 30 media luminary Griffin McElroy.

8
00:00:56,160 --> 00:01:00,960
Are you ready for more football? I'm ready for twice the amount of

9
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:05,360
football I currently consume, which would still determined night of the week party.

10
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:12,400
It's some night and the balls are hot. Don't touch the balls cause you'll burn your hands.

11
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:17,760
We have a bunch of some announcers to be determined. They're going to get it kickstarted

12
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:24,720
or maybe like handoff started. We don't know. We haven't finished out the rules yet.

13
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:29,920
There may not even be a ball this time. It's football of the mind XFL.

14
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:32,960
You probably guess we're starting an XFL team.

15
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:37,440
And you've everybody's been asking us to do this even before Vince came out and made his

16
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:40,800
definitely real announcement about the thing that's definitely definitely going to happen,

17
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:46,400
which is the XFL. Very exciting new football proposition where a catch is a catch and you

18
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:55,040
can't ever protest for any reason ever. And it's very I mean to me both those is yeah. Vince,

19
00:01:55,040 --> 00:02:01,760
I definitely get it. I don't get it as somebody who got in early with the XFL with our new the

20
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:09,040
next XFL, the XXFL. We have gotten like first out. The first thing we had to figure out was,

21
00:02:09,040 --> 00:02:15,280
of course, the team. What are they? Yeah, I'm pushing for the Milton somethings.

22
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:20,640
Oh, I thought you literally meant like what species are we going to put on the field?

23
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:26,640
OK, you mean does XFL it's yeah. Trav brings up a good point. Could be anything out there.

24
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:34,960
Bunch of frogs. They're all pumas. Yeah, they're all the name of the team is the Jaguars.

25
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:39,440
And people are not going to they're going to there's going to be a lot of dissonance there.

26
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:44,080
And as long as this thing's just a big old stinking middle finger to the NFL,

27
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:49,120
we may as well just make it the Jacksonville Jaguars again. OK, fucking come at us because

28
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:54,640
it's a different thing. Bortles, because that's the thing about the XFL. It's it's literally no

29
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:59,600
rules, no rights. Well, there's one. Travis, I do have to stop you right there because there's one

30
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:05,040
very important rule. What's that? And that is you can never express your dissatisfaction with

31
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:10,000
anything for any reason ever. Or else Vince will come to his house, to your house even.

32
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:15,600
You'll come to Vince's house. That's how he does it. And he'll unhinge his jaw and he'll eat you.

33
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:20,640
Oh, OK. The rule is and then we have a list of some. Where did I put my list of

34
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:29,360
rules? Oh, here it is. Here it is. So the first rule of the XFL obviously is if you kneel during

35
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:37,040
the anthem, you have to eat an entire airplane tire. And that is stringent. I will agree.

36
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:43,120
Draconian. I might argue. Draconian. The penalty actually goes up. So the second time you kneel

37
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:47,200
during the anthem, you are going to have to consume an entire landing gear. And if you're

38
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:52,720
particularly frustrated and you feel compelled to kneel by the end of the season, I mean,

39
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:57,680
you could be eating an entire airplane. Well, this is why I've actually heard some owners and players

40
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:01,280
already planning that how they're going to work around this is they're going to kneel once, eat

41
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:08,640
the tire, but never get up. Yeah. Yeah. Just do all the football from sort of the from a sort of

42
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:14,640
prone kneeling position. Yeah. And listen, it's tough, but if you get like knee pads with wheels

43
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:20,960
on them, call them kneelies. And then, yeah, we can definitely market that to the eight people

44
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:29,760
who are going to watch this. Hey, Vince, you dumb asshole. Do you realize the fucking delicious

45
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:37,360
Footloose-esque situation you are setting? Now, no, this is a sports with no protesting. You hear

46
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:45,680
the first fucking guy that gets down on the knee is going. It is going to be so much more powerful.

47
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:51,920
You big, dumb asshole. What are you like fucking Babe Ruth calling his shot? But Babe Ruth just

48
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:56,400
held up the middle finger to everybody. I've got this idea for a new football league that will

49
00:04:56,400 --> 00:05:02,240
generate the most powerful political statement ever created by sport. What the fuck? Are you

50
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:09,440
out of your fucking mind, Vince? You can't ever. Like, I'll never experience the thrilling level

51
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:16,960
of dancing in an area where dancing has been forbidden, because that would just be the best,

52
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:24,800
funnest dance that you could do, I think. And that is the situation that he has developed here,

53
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:30,720
where it's like, protests? Well, no, not here. That's the best protest you can do,

54
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:36,240
is when they tell you you can't. That's actually how protesting works. That's how it works, dog.

55
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:48,320
Jesus, Vince. Vince. It's just disgusting, man. It's just no way. The towns that had one before,

56
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:55,280
right? You're not going to fool them once, et cetera, et cetera. So it's going to be all second

57
00:05:55,280 --> 00:06:00,960
stringer towns, right? Or third string towns. Because I guess the first string has NFL,

58
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:07,360
and the second string had the XFL the first time. So now you're down to third tier towns. And that's

59
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:12,560
not to besmirch the good name of Milton, but if this thing tanks, I didn't want Huntington all

60
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:16,640
tied up with it. We did have our own arena football team, the Huntington- The River City

61
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:25,520
Locomotives. The River City Locomotives. Thank you, Griffin. Great team. Lots of fumbles.

62
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:35,440
Just number the stars that it's about that may fumble. I was actually in an and for the River

63
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:42,000
City Locomotives when they were looking for a new mascot. And my thing was, I just strode around the

64
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:48,160
stage going choo-choo, choo-choo. And if I remember how the ad went, I got the job. So if you can get

65
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:53,440
that on YouTube somewhere, just please let me know. And if I remember correctly, I think our dad owned

66
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:58,960
1% of the River City. He was the emcee of the River City Locomotives, which meant we got free soda,

67
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:07,120
which if we do get the XFL team, the Milton big lads going, then I'm hoping that that is a benefit

68
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:13,280
that will continue, because then I will be full-throated support of this new, exciting,

69
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:16,800
not going to happen- Well, unfortunately, you have to do full-throated support. Like, that's the problem.

70
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:21,520
It's like, so we're probably not going to do that team. I don't think we should probably support that.

71
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:26,800
I mean, I could try out. I mean, they're going to need eight teams of 40 people each. That's what?

72
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:33,200
Like 800 people. And I think I stand a pretty good shot. Never could make the Comac Middle School

73
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:39,520
basketball team, but I actually think I stand a better chance of getting in on this new football

74
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:44,400
league. And then my friend Stone Cold Steve Austin's going to come in and be like,

75
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:50,000
you can't escape me, Vincent. Crush a high life. And then crush Vincent's skull right there in front

76
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:56,560
of God and everyone. And then we'll be the new kings of football. And you'll kneel, but to us,

77
00:07:56,560 --> 00:08:02,640
me and my friend Austin, which is what I call him, even though it's his last name.

78
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:09,280
So anyway. So what do you guys think about the new Fall Out Boy album? I think it's really good.

79
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:15,600
Yeah. Okay. Let's do a question. Every year, a local theater has a 24-hour Groundhog Day marathon.

80
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:20,080
If you stay through the entire 24 hours, 12 screenings, you win movie passes for a year.

81
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:25,600
I'm planning on going this year and by God, I'm getting those movie passes. How do you suggest I

82
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:29,840
pass the time, other than bringing my 3DS with Pokemon Ultra Moon and headphones to listen to

83
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:35,040
my Bim Bam? I'm going with one friend, so we're also thinking about bringing cards slash board

84
00:08:35,040 --> 00:08:40,160
games and any suggestions are welcome. That's from Bed Sores with Bill Murray. I got a pretty good

85
00:08:40,160 --> 00:08:45,120
thing you could do. Yeah, I have a super good suggestion. You could watch one of the best

86
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:49,920
movies ever made. Yeah, you could just kind of tune into the giant screen in front of you and

87
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:55,040
watch the best movie ever, is what you might do. Because here's what you get. You get an amazing

88
00:08:55,040 --> 00:09:03,120
one to see. I would love to see Groundhog Day in theaters. But also, maybe by that 24th hour,

89
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:10,000
that 12th viewing, you have realized whole new theories and nuances about this film.

90
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:14,880
Yeah. It's a wild film. If you read some of the stuff that was cut from Groundhog Day,

91
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:21,760
it is wild. It supposedly encapsulates, I think I read 10,000 years.

92
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:26,000
So there's not a canonical length of time. There's not, but as originally written,

93
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:32,320
it was like 10,000 years. There's also originally a curse that a scorned ex placed on Bill Murray's.

94
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:36,560
You can find out all about this on Chuck's podcast, Movie Crush I was on, where I talked

95
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:44,960
about this, my favorite movie of all time. I would not do this for anything because this

96
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:49,040
really is my favorite movie ever. And I do worry that watching it 12 times in one day

97
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:54,640
would make it not my favorite movie ever. And I do not want that to be stripped away.

98
00:09:55,360 --> 00:10:01,440
Can I pitch to you? I had an idea the other day about if I were going to make a Groundhog Day-esque

99
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:10,160
movie. Something that I cannot think of because the whole live the same day over again is not

100
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:14,240
solely contained to Groundhog Day. Let me just say this real quick. Let me

101
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:19,120
preface this by saying we are on a really good streak right now of you not pitching movies

102
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:24,080
that is not going to get made on a podcast. It's been like 90 episodes or so.

103
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:27,360
Someone should make this movie. I don't know if I'm going to make it, but somebody should

104
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:30,720
make this movie because I don't think it's ever been done before. A Groundhog Day,

105
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:38,000
same day over again kind of thing, but everyone is aware of it. It's not just one person.

106
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:45,680
Everyone wakes up going, again? Because I think it would get really apocalyptic really fast.

107
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:52,320
Very like Caligulin-like. No, yeah, it would turn into a big old bone

108
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:58,320
pile. How about this idea for a movie? It's a Groundhog Day, but a man lives every second

109
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:10,640
over again, and so he's just like, fuck shit up, no, crap, fuck, no, shit up, it's happening again,

110
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:25,680
Andy McDowell, I fuck you, and I realize that this whole time I've been so selfish.

111
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:29,520
I don't know why he became a robot there close to the end, but that was a good two minutes of

112
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:35,040
the podcast that we don't have to worry about. That's gone now. And two minutes of your life

113
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:41,040
listening at home, so sorry about that. One thing that would be fun is, you know how Bill

114
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:45,120
Murray lives the same day over and over again in that movie and he starts to learn things so he

115
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:49,120
seems like he can predict the future because he doesn't before they happen? You could see if you

116
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:53,040
watch it enough, you might be able to start beating Bill to some of them so it makes him

117
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:57,040
look like the clown because you said the lady was going to drop the dishes before the lady

118
00:11:57,040 --> 00:12:00,400
dropped the dishes, but also before Bill Murray said the lady was going to drop the dishes.

119
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:08,800
What if in Groundhog Day Chris Elliott is also reliving the same day over and again because he

120
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:14,480
can't say that to Bill Murray because he doesn't know that Bill Murray's living the same day over

121
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:20,400
again. Good point. What if everyone is independently in Groundhog Day living the same day over again?

122
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:25,120
Chris Elliott is living the same day over again, but he's just rolling with it.

123
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:27,280
Yeah, he's loving it.

124
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:32,160
This day was as fine as any of my other days. This is as good a day as any to just sort of

125
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:40,480
kick it in. I think that I'll go ahead and just live in this day for a while. That's fine. You

126
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:46,400
know, one thing you could do is if you watch it enough, I bet you could figure out which scenes

127
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:51,920
are Bill Murray's butt double and which scenes are just actually Bill Murray because it's hard

128
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:57,760
with the lighting in some of the scenes, some of the extended sex scenes, to figure out which one

129
00:12:57,760 --> 00:13:00,960
is Bill Murray and which one is his butt double. Lorenzo music.

130
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:05,360
Oh, I thought you said that, but I had a different joke, so I was wondering if I could do mine.

131
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:09,600
Live the joke over again.

132
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:14,480
Okay, we do the joke over again. It's confusing. It's actually a lot of times Brian Doyle-Murray

133
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:19,200
because they said, like, we need a brother's butt. Like, you know how in my butt scenes in

134
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:23,920
the Bim Bam shows, sometimes we just swap out one. Well, Justin's butt. Travis has the enormous

135
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:24,800
tattoo.

136
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:28,800
Well, that's why we just rotate butts. Griffin does it for Justin. Justin does it for me,

137
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:32,560
and I do it for Griffin. It's hard to keep him in mind, you know?

138
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:36,800
And in the scenes where Brian Doyle-Murray's butt is, because he plays the mayor, if memory serves,

139
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:41,920
Bill would step in and be like, don't worry. Take a load off, Brian.

140
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:48,960
I like Griffin's joke because it doesn't require an in-depth knowledge of voice actors that have

141
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:53,120
played roles originated by Bill Murray. So I love that part of it.

142
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:56,160
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. See, that was so deep I didn't even get it.

143
00:13:58,400 --> 00:14:02,720
So it's kind of funny because Lorenzo music played Peter Vinkman in the Ghostbusters cartoon,

144
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:08,720
and then Lorenzo music did the voice of Garfield, and then Bill Murray in the TV show,

145
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:11,360
but then after that, Bill Murray did the voice of Garfield in the movie.

146
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:15,680
And then finally Bill Murray was free, and he could leave that cave.

147
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:17,840
He'd been trapped in by Lorenzo music.

148
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:19,600
Trav, do you want to do one?

149
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:21,040
Yeah, do you want to try a joke about a butt?

150
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:26,800
Oh, okay. About Bill Murray's butt?

151
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:27,680
Yeah, about his hiney.

152
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:33,920
Yeah, it gets confusing because sometimes it's Bill Murray, but sometimes it's Garfield.

153
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:38,640
Yeah, so if you see a big furry orange butt.

154
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:41,440
Now that one kind of built off of what I did.

155
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:46,080
Well, but if I had done mine first, it would have seemed like yours built off of mine,

156
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:47,440
so who's to say?

157
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:51,440
That's a very good point, but I think yours would have seemed like the ravings of a madman.

158
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:55,680
Yeah, is there a way to combine all three of our jokes into something that it's even remotely,

159
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:57,280
like even a little bit funny?

160
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:02,320
Yeah, so maybe if we just say all the names at the same time,

161
00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:05,040
and it's sort of a choose your own adventure.

162
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:10,240
Isn't it fun that in Brian Doyle Murray's name, Doyle just really stands out in there?

163
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:12,800
Because if he was just Brian Murray, it's like, oh, that could be anyone.

164
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:15,760
But Brian Doyle Murray, now we've got-

165
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:20,400
He probably did it intentionally to like make the differentiation clear, right?

166
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:21,200
I have to assume.

167
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:23,360
How about a yeah?

168
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:25,360
Yeah, give me another question.

169
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:26,640
This one was sent in by Aaron Keys.

170
00:15:26,640 --> 00:15:27,120
Thank you, Aaron.

171
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:28,400
It's Yahoo Answers user.

172
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:29,440
Chaz Van Bloom.

173
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:33,600
Nope, Chaz Van Blom, even better, asks,

174
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:37,760
how deep inside an apple is the most nutrition?

175
00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:41,280
Enjoying a freshly cut Washington state apple.

176
00:15:41,280 --> 00:15:45,040
And they put the R marked on it for a trademark.

177
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:46,160
Mm-hmm.

178
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:47,040
I don't think Washington state-

179
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:49,680
Washington state brand apples from Oregon.

180
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:56,320
How if different nutritional value is the, if, so wait, you've offered me a choice here.

181
00:15:56,320 --> 00:16:01,360
So I'm gonna go with, if different is the nutritional value is the peel depth to the

182
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:06,720
center where the seeds sit, does the flesh of the apple go into varying ranges with changing

183
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:09,600
nutritional levels getting higher toward the seeds?

184
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:16,880
Remembering earth science slash AG classes, do vegetables, onions, beets, et cetera, have

185
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:21,760
this same nutritional range that varies as by how deep the veggie is cut.

186
00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:23,600
You're eating an apple.

187
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:24,100
Mm-hmm.

188
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:28,080
Certainly you've cut it up because worms.

189
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:36,000
And you're eating the apple, where's this, where's that pocket of those dank nutrients at?

190
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,840
Because a lot of people look at the apple and say, I get that.

191
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:42,480
That's the skin, that's the flesh, it's really fucked up, that's what we call those two things.

192
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:46,880
And then there's the core with the seeds, which people eat only as YouTube-like challenges.

193
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:55,920
But is there other sort of zones in the apple that are best for you?

194
00:16:55,920 --> 00:17:05,840
Like striation, like the strata of apple, that as you move down through, the crust, the core.

195
00:17:05,840 --> 00:17:12,160
You bind into the apple and you hit the vitamin pocket, and it expels a gaseous cloud of vitamins

196
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:14,240
that you breathe in and you're stronger.

197
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:18,480
We'll get the obvious out of the way first, it ain't the seeds, because those contain

198
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:21,200
a chemical that's transformed into cyanide in your stomach.

199
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:24,400
Though admittedly, not enough to do you.

200
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:26,560
Not enough to do you any damage.

201
00:17:26,560 --> 00:17:28,960
You would have to eat something like a million apples.

202
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:32,800
No, between 150 and a few thousand should do it, actually.

203
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:34,240
A lot, a lot of apples.

204
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:35,040
A lot, a lot.

205
00:17:35,040 --> 00:17:36,640
How am I supposed to eat all these apples?

206
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:38,000
Aren't my crash bandicoot?

207
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,480
I thought those were mangoes.

208
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:42,320
Shh, they're a wump of fruit.

209
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:42,880
It's fine, though.

210
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:45,680
Not everybody knows as much about crash bandicoot as I do.

211
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:50,160
So don't eat the seeds, because cyanide, not good.

212
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:52,480
There's probably some good stuff in there, too.

213
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:57,280
It's not just, if you pour a bunch of cyanide in the ground, an apple tree doesn't climb

214
00:17:57,280 --> 00:17:57,920
out of it.

215
00:17:57,920 --> 00:18:01,920
But I need to clarify for everybody, the vitamins are in the seeds, okay?

216
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:03,760
Like, not those.

217
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:04,720
Here's where I'm coming from.

218
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:10,320
I look at an apple and I say, I obviously want the vitamins out of this, because that's

219
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:11,280
how I look at all food.

220
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:14,240
I look at a pizza, I say, there's probably not many vitamins in here, but I'll figure

221
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:15,760
out where these motherfuckers are.

222
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:22,400
I look at an apple and I say, this is going to be a lot of work if I do a vitamin excavation

223
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:24,080
looking for the vitamins in here.

224
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:28,080
I want to get in, I want to get that vitamin pocket, and I want to get out.

225
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:29,520
Where's that thing hiding?

226
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:30,720
Where is that little bubble hiding?

227
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:32,400
In the seeds.

228
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:34,240
Well, shoot, Trav.

229
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:37,040
That's about as deep in the apple as it gets, I think.

230
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:39,520
Well, yeah, but the apple has to protect itself.

231
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:40,960
Now, here's the thing, Justin, to your point.

232
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:42,880
It is not the seeds that contain the vitamin.

233
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:47,040
It is the pockets that contain the seeds, contains the vitamins.

234
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:51,440
Oh, so I jammed my tongue in there, in one of those seed holes, and now all of a sudden

235
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:53,120
I just got 10% stronger.

236
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:54,880
Oh, yeah, so strong.

237
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:55,920
It's possible.

238
00:18:55,920 --> 00:18:56,640
Think about it.

239
00:18:57,280 --> 00:19:03,040
I would think that it would want to keep the nutrients close to its center for its apple

240
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:04,000
babies, the seeds.

241
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:04,500
Yeah.

242
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:10,400
So you have to assume that the good stuff is towards the center, but not the center itself.

243
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:11,520
And the apple's fine.

244
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:16,000
Is there something in the stem that we should be eating?

245
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:16,720
I don't know about that.

246
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:20,400
I'm wanting to get to the stem next, because there's something going on there, isn't there?

247
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:21,680
Because nobody's eating that.

248
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:24,880
We'll talk about the stem, and then we'll talk about the apple butthole on the other side.

249
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:27,840
Maybe let's talk about eating the apple's ass.

250
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:32,160
This is all that people are talking about these days.

251
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:34,000
Is eating the apple's ass.

252
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,440
The apple ass challenge.

253
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:39,920
Well, specifically just eating ass, and I'm wondering if it's because they're really

254
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:41,920
talking about getting it at the apple bottom.

255
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:42,400
Yeah.

256
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:45,440
The one part we never think about, the apple butthole.

257
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:46,240
Yes.

258
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:50,960
I've learned that the less you like a food, the better it is for you.

259
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:54,080
And I really don't like eating the stem.

260
00:19:54,640 --> 00:20:00,320
So I have to assume that motherfucker's just packed with vitamins and nutrients.

261
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:01,840
And protein.

262
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:07,120
I would like to go on record right now and say I would like to label from now on everyone,

263
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:10,000
everyone in the world, because everyone in the world listens to this show.

264
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:10,960
Right.

265
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:14,640
From now on, I would like to refer to the apple asshole as the applejack.

266
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:19,200
Let's just establish that that's what an applejack is.

267
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:20,080
Okay.

268
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:26,000
So you want to call the butthole the applejack.

269
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:26,240
Yeah.

270
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:30,800
And now is this going to be, I know the answer already, but are people going to start referring

271
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:33,280
to their own buttholes as an applejack?

272
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:33,760
Yeah.

273
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:35,520
I mean, that is how language evolves.

274
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:38,080
It starts with the apples, it goes to the humans.

275
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:39,120
That's how it's always been.

276
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:40,080
Yeah.

277
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:44,640
Now I feel like I need to step in here because it's contractually obligated.

278
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:47,360
And if I don't, I will hear about it.

279
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:49,520
One time I ate a banana funny.

280
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:51,840
I don't literally know anything else to say about it.

281
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:56,240
But if I didn't say that, then I would get tweets, how you not talk about the banana

282
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:57,200
you ate funny.

283
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:57,680
And I know-

284
00:20:57,680 --> 00:20:59,040
One time Griffin ate a banana funny.

285
00:20:59,040 --> 00:21:01,120
And I already mentioned mango too, so I'm cool.

286
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:04,960
Yeah, so Justin, you got any stuff for your brand that you need to sort of dump in here?

287
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:05,520
Or else-

288
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:08,400
Regarding sort of like brands and fruits.

289
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:13,840
Yeah, have you ever said anything funny about apples or fruit or eating ass or anything?

290
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:23,840
I mean, there was the one man show about how much I like grapes.

291
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:29,040
And if I remember correctly, it was called I Love Grapes because I wanted to get it out.

292
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:32,880
Well, if I remember the working title was Grape Expectations.

293
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:36,480
And I thought that that was a real chuckle.

294
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:37,680
I really love that one.

295
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:43,520
If I remember correctly, though, the full title was Grape Expectations bracket eating ass.

296
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:46,320
Yeah.

297
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:49,600
Well, the director of that, Boz, he thought that I-

298
00:21:51,040 --> 00:21:52,160
Sorry, you're Lerman though.

299
00:21:53,040 --> 00:21:53,520
Or Justin.

300
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:54,480
Skaggs, Skaggs.

301
00:21:54,480 --> 00:22:06,640
He thought that people would be confused about if it was completely about grapes

302
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:11,600
or some about grapes and some about Charles Dickens.

303
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:13,200
So he thought that it was just like, I love grapes.

304
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:14,720
Because Charles Dickens loved eating ass.

305
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:19,840
Yeah, he also tried to get me to make Lito shuffle the intro, outro,

306
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:23,120
and sort of all throughout underneath very quiet.

307
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:25,200
And I said, Boz, I love the tune.

308
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:28,640
It may be too much of the Lito shuffle.

309
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:32,160
Now, is that a song that Boz Skaggs did?

310
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:33,120
Yeah, you gotta tell us.

311
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:35,840
Oh, man, it's a heat rock trap.

312
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:37,360
You should look it up after we're done here.

313
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:39,440
You've probably heard it before you didn't realize it was called that.

314
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:40,880
Anyway, I need some advice.

315
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:42,800
Two years ago, my husband and I bought a house.

316
00:22:42,800 --> 00:22:43,600
Congratulations.

317
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:47,440
The neighbors are very nice, but they have a hearse parked in the driveway.

318
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:50,720
Initially, we didn't really mind the hearse.

319
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:53,440
However, it has not started in two years,

320
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:57,840
and it is attracting unwanted attention, gawkers, weirdos.

321
00:22:57,840 --> 00:22:58,800
And some of the neighbors-

322
00:22:58,800 --> 00:23:01,440
Unwanted from you, question asker.

323
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:01,920
Guaranteed not from her son.

324
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:03,280
They may be dying for it.

325
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:06,880
Several other neighbors are trying to sell their houses

326
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:08,640
and have complained about the hearse.

327
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:11,600
Before you ask, yes, there is a coffin in the back.

328
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:12,720
Oh, shit.

329
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:14,640
Our neighbor loves this thing.

330
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:16,480
He has it parked in the middle of his driveway.

331
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:21,520
He is unable to park either his family's nice, drivable new cars

332
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:24,800
in the driveway because of this horseless death carriage.

333
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:27,920
How do we ask him to move his beloved mortician mobile

334
00:23:27,920 --> 00:23:30,720
up the driveway outside?

335
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:35,760
Frequent listeners.

336
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:36,400
That's their name.

337
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:37,600
That's from frequent listeners.

338
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:41,520
P.S. The plot thickens.

339
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:44,960
He has started playing an organ very late at night,

340
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:47,040
but only on Sundays.

341
00:23:47,040 --> 00:23:48,320
What the fuck?

342
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:49,440
No, here's the thing.

343
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:50,640
Here's the thing.

344
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:51,520
Here's the thing.

345
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:53,520
What's the thing?

346
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:54,400
Give me the thing,

347
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:57,840
because I would love a thing to cling to right now.

348
00:23:57,840 --> 00:24:01,680
This person is leaning into this, like, persona, right?

349
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:04,000
And so any complaining you do,

350
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,400
or like, this is off-putting, people are staring.

351
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:07,520
That's what they want.

352
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:13,200
You need to play up how, like, how, like, kind of blah it is.

353
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:16,080
Like, ah, a hearse in the driveway.

354
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:18,160
Yeah, no, all over town now.

355
00:24:18,160 --> 00:24:20,160
Like, it has to not be-

356
00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:22,880
You also have to buy a hearse with a coffin in the back

357
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:23,520
and park it.

358
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:26,560
You've got to make having a hearse seem like,

359
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:29,760
you know, having like a funny shaped mailbox.

360
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:31,200
You know?

361
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:32,160
Everybody's got one.

362
00:24:32,160 --> 00:24:33,120
Everyone's got one.

363
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:34,160
Oh, a hearse.

364
00:24:34,160 --> 00:24:34,880
That's cute.

365
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:37,440
Yeah, I was just reading in Vogue

366
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:39,120
about how everyone's got a hearse.

367
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:39,760
You know what I mean?

368
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:43,120
Something like, oh, this is so normal now.

369
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:45,760
Does, real quick, does everybody have a funny shaped mailbox?

370
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:47,120
I thought it was just me.

371
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:48,560
I got one that looks like an Applejack.

372
00:24:49,680 --> 00:24:52,560
And you got to kind of blast it right in there.

373
00:24:52,560 --> 00:24:53,060
Yeah.

374
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:56,560
So other possibility, lazy vampire.

375
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:58,080
I'll get to it.

376
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:00,560
You got to get that fucking coffin in the house.

377
00:25:00,560 --> 00:25:03,680
We bought it, along with the hearse, to transport it.

378
00:25:03,680 --> 00:25:05,280
And I'm sleepy.

379
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:07,280
I haven't got a wink in a long time.

380
00:25:07,280 --> 00:25:09,120
I need somewhere to post up.

381
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:11,920
Maybe that's for when he's fighting with his vampire husband.

382
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:14,160
You know what?

383
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:17,600
I'm going to sleep in the car.

384
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:18,000
Yeah.

385
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:18,800
Fine.

386
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:19,280
Fine.

387
00:25:19,280 --> 00:25:19,680
Fine.

388
00:25:19,680 --> 00:25:20,240
Oh, wait.

389
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:20,720
Hold on.

390
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:21,280
I got to wait.

391
00:25:21,280 --> 00:25:22,000
Sun setting.

392
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,640
But in like five minutes.

393
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:26,640
In five minutes, I'm going to storm right out of here.

394
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:31,360
There's definitely not a body in there, right?

395
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:32,800
Definitely not.

396
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:34,320
No, I mean, legally speaking.

397
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:35,440
That would be a crime.

398
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:37,200
Yeah, it's a criminal crime, I guess.

399
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:44,400
Could you get one of those, you know how Domino's pizza delivery drivers have like the big sign

400
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:45,360
on top?

401
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:48,960
Could you get one of those and permanently affix it to the top of the hearse when he's

402
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:49,760
not looking?

403
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:50,480
Of Domino's?

404
00:25:51,280 --> 00:25:56,960
Like get a Domino's pizza delivery sign and affix it to the top of the hearse permanently.

405
00:25:57,520 --> 00:25:59,760
Because that, I think, is going to mute.

406
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:03,840
That is something anybody would like to have in their neighborhood, because that's hilarious.

407
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:06,000
So wait, you're telling me?

408
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:06,500
Yeah.

409
00:26:06,500 --> 00:26:10,560
We're probably going to be selling our house here in the next few months or so.

410
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:16,720
You're telling me if I go over to my neighbor's house and permanently affix a Domino's pizza

411
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:20,720
sort of beacon on top of their car.

412
00:26:21,280 --> 00:26:21,920
Yeah, yep.

413
00:26:21,920 --> 00:26:25,840
It will drive up the property value of every other house on the street because everybody

414
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:30,000
wants to live next to the Domino's pizza car because then they think, boy, if I order Domino's,

415
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:31,760
it'll be here in like four seconds.

416
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:33,920
No, I think they'll think they want to.

417
00:26:33,920 --> 00:26:37,200
They don't want to live next to a Domino's pizza delivery car.

418
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:41,360
They want to live next to the pizza hearse because, yes, that's amazing.

419
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:44,560
That's how you get on Atlas Obscura right there.

420
00:26:44,560 --> 00:26:45,440
Thank you, Travis.

421
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:46,960
Yes, absolutely.

422
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:50,160
Oh, you got to go see the pizza hearse.

423
00:26:50,160 --> 00:26:51,600
So we didn't talk about organ.

424
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:54,640
The organ bit is something.

425
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:56,160
On Sundays.

426
00:26:56,160 --> 00:27:02,400
Well, there's a very vital piece of information missing, which is what kind of music is he

427
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:03,040
playing?

428
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:06,640
Is it like scary family opera music or is he just doing like covers?

429
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:12,560
Maybe he's doing a soundtrack for his family watching the football game that evening.

430
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:14,160
They watch the silent.

431
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:17,280
They got the silent reel and he has to play along.

432
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:22,480
They got a silent TV and he plays along to sort of in company and then every once in a while

433
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:26,720
he'll write what he thinks the announcers are saying on a card and hold it up in front

434
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:27,120
of the screen.

435
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:28,800
You did football bad.

436
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:29,840
Minus 10 feet.

437
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:32,480
I mean, you got to park them somewhere.

438
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:34,000
I think we can all agree on that.

439
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:37,360
Hearse has got to go somewhere that you don't just build a hearse every time you got to

440
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:38,320
do a funeral.

441
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:43,600
And it doesn't sound like he's it starts necessarily like it's not working.

442
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:45,200
It sounds like to me, right?

443
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:47,200
It's like malfunctioned.

444
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:50,640
You brought up that he's got it parked in the middle of the driveway so the other cars

445
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:51,760
can't get in the driveway.

446
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:56,000
But I would not, I think, want to confront this reminder.

447
00:27:56,000 --> 00:28:02,400
This is grim reminder every time I had to hop in the ride to head to target in the life

448
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:07,040
whip, you know what I don't want to get in my living whip and look over into the death

449
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:12,080
whip every time I every time I had to go to the, you know, get my waxing done.

450
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:17,520
And that's fair because they also like it would be I actually think weirder if you parked

451
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:22,560
the cars there just because contextually that would be weird because then you're not setting

452
00:28:22,560 --> 00:28:26,880
the hearse apart as like, look at this oddity I have parked in my driveway.

453
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:29,920
Then it just becomes like another car I have.

454
00:28:29,920 --> 00:28:37,360
And that's far weirder to me if it was like, there's my Subaru, there's my Toyota, and

455
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:39,040
there's my death car.

456
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:41,600
What's the brand of the death car?

457
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:47,680
Is it like a really is it just like a long extended cab Hyundai Elantra?

458
00:28:47,680 --> 00:28:49,520
Like, it's got to have a brand, right?

459
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:51,120
Is it like Ford?

460
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:55,120
Is it like Ford Ford Ford built Ford tough.

461
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:58,880
It's the Ford boat to cross the river stick.

462
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:01,960
The last ride you'll ever need Ford.

463
00:29:01,960 --> 00:29:03,280
That's a very good question.

464
00:29:03,280 --> 00:29:05,480
Who's making these dang things?

465
00:29:05,480 --> 00:29:08,000
Who's making these things?

466
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:09,000
I don't want to know.

467
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:10,000
Don't tweet at me.

468
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:11,000
Yeah, please don't let me know.

469
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:12,000
Please don't.

470
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,000
Please don't tweet about hearses.

471
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:14,000
I will.

472
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:15,000
I do want to say this.

473
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:17,320
I'm assuming there was not a picture attached to this travel.

474
00:29:17,320 --> 00:29:18,320
It was not.

475
00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:19,320
No.

476
00:29:19,320 --> 00:29:23,840
People if you're gonna if you're in a situation like this where it would be very easy to please

477
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:27,800
just go ahead and snap a pic and you know, let us know if it could be publicly serviced

478
00:29:27,800 --> 00:29:28,800
or not.

479
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:31,000
The answer is almost always probably no.

480
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:32,860
But go ahead and include that pic.

481
00:29:32,860 --> 00:29:38,080
That's sort of get a better like just send a pic because I feel differently.

482
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:44,400
I feel differently about this if it's like a rusted out Hulk versus like a shining beautiful

483
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:49,080
sleek black brand new looking take real good care of right.

484
00:29:49,080 --> 00:29:50,080
That's the case.

485
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:53,100
Exhibit has gotten his hands on this hearse.

486
00:29:53,100 --> 00:29:57,840
Maybe your neighbors planning to do like ghost tours at some point.

487
00:29:57,840 --> 00:30:01,400
They just haven't really gotten their shit together enough to figure out where the ghosts

488
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:04,120
are because that's one of the important things.

489
00:30:04,120 --> 00:30:09,040
You don't want to be telling a bunch of cockamamie tales about the locales of ghosts.

490
00:30:09,040 --> 00:30:13,300
You want to make sure you know where they are so it's a legit tour because the critics

491
00:30:13,300 --> 00:30:17,160
will come and they'll tear you apart if it's ghost free locations, you know?

492
00:30:17,160 --> 00:30:19,920
Yeah and I mean it's probably definitely a grave robber.

493
00:30:19,920 --> 00:30:21,240
Should we do a money zone?

494
00:30:21,240 --> 00:30:25,840
Well I real quick can I tell a hearse related Travis anecdote very quickly?

495
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:30,920
Oh I love your Travis anecdote and especially about hearse.

496
00:30:30,920 --> 00:30:35,320
In 10th grade we were assigned a writing assignment that was like what would you do after high

497
00:30:35,320 --> 00:30:39,140
school if you suddenly had a bunch of money and we had to write like where the money would

498
00:30:39,140 --> 00:30:45,320
come from and what it would be and I was super into the idea of monster hunting at the time.

499
00:30:45,320 --> 00:30:49,640
So that's what I said I would do- I remember this fucking report you wrote.

500
00:30:49,640 --> 00:30:54,260
I would get a hearse and I'd put a motorcycle in the back in case I need the motorcycle

501
00:30:54,260 --> 00:30:56,620
and the hearse, I don't know- Definitely not legal.

502
00:30:56,620 --> 00:30:57,620
Probably not legal.

503
00:30:57,620 --> 00:31:01,760
No definitely not legal but I guess in my head I was picturing the motorcycle ejecting

504
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:03,560
out the back of the hearse whenever I needed it.

505
00:31:03,560 --> 00:31:09,040
The hearse immediately veering off the road and exploding because nobody's driving.

506
00:31:09,040 --> 00:31:13,220
But now I have my motorcycle and everything's fine and I wrote about like going to the Winchester

507
00:31:13,220 --> 00:31:17,560
house and finding out no in fact it wasn't haunted but there were vampires there.

508
00:31:17,560 --> 00:31:23,440
Anyways so I turned this in and the teacher was like well I can't fault the writing but

509
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:27,560
this was supposed to be like in real life what would you do?

510
00:31:27,560 --> 00:31:32,680
And I think I wrote that I would have gotten the money from my family dying in a very mysterious

511
00:31:32,680 --> 00:31:33,680
way.

512
00:31:33,680 --> 00:31:37,100
So I was also hunting that and she was like- Glad we got uh glad we got to be involved

513
00:31:37,100 --> 00:31:38,100
Trav there.

514
00:31:38,100 --> 00:31:41,920
Yeah glad we got in there in the margins and in the text crawl at the beginning of the

515
00:31:41,920 --> 00:31:42,920
film.

516
00:31:42,920 --> 00:31:48,400
Well Nessie survived the Scottish Terrier and she traveled with me to help me hunt ghosts

517
00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:54,840
and you know in retrospect uh I actually think that is what I would have done uh had I uh

518
00:31:54,840 --> 00:31:58,240
you know not gone on to college and if my family had all died mysteriously and given

519
00:31:58,240 --> 00:31:59,240
me thousands of dollars.

520
00:31:59,240 --> 00:32:00,240
Oh sorry to disappoint you there Trav.

521
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:01,240
Sorry I'm still thinking.

522
00:32:01,240 --> 00:32:02,240
Yeah sorry bud.

523
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:04,400
Well you know you all really let me down.

524
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:11,320
That teacher Eric Kripke took your shit, made supernatural, made like a billion dollars.

525
00:32:11,320 --> 00:32:12,320
Yeah I don't want to talk about it.

526
00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:13,320
Yeah I know.

527
00:32:13,320 --> 00:32:14,320
They're always trying.

528
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:15,320
They're always trying to get you and Eric got you good on this one.

529
00:32:15,320 --> 00:32:18,200
I keep giving away these movie ideas, TV show ideas.

530
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:19,200
Yeah.

531
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:22,840
Griffin um Griffin mentioned supernatural so I've got to delete my Twitter account real

532
00:32:22,840 --> 00:32:26,560
quick.

533
00:32:26,560 --> 00:32:33,760
In the interim let's go to the money zone.

534
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:44,680
Well I get home from a hard day at the office and what do I see as I pull into my driveway?

535
00:32:44,680 --> 00:32:46,600
A large box.

536
00:32:46,600 --> 00:32:47,600
Oh a hearse?

537
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:48,600
I don't remember.

538
00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:49,600
Coffin.

539
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:50,600
I don't remember I don't remember ordering anything.

540
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:52,840
I tear it open.

541
00:32:52,840 --> 00:32:55,640
Not the way you're supposed to open it just like start ripping into it because I'm so

542
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:56,640
curious.

543
00:32:56,640 --> 00:32:58,400
You know what's in there?

544
00:32:58,400 --> 00:33:01,240
Beautiful bouquet from uh Pro Flowers.

545
00:33:01,240 --> 00:33:02,240
Oh okay.

546
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:04,560
Is this a real story or sort of a dream quest you're going on?

547
00:33:04,560 --> 00:33:09,200
No this is a true story that happened to me and I thought boy somebody must love me very

548
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:11,040
much I felt so special.

549
00:33:11,040 --> 00:33:15,400
I did read the card and it's like we're excited about the ad campaign it's like well that's

550
00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:20,160
sweet but you all do have a lot of flowers so it's not like you're hurting for them but

551
00:33:20,160 --> 00:33:22,160
I did appreciate the gesture.

552
00:33:22,160 --> 00:33:27,000
There were some berries in there too but if you want to make a big uh impression on somebody

553
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:31,600
why not try Pro Flowers it's the perfect way.

554
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:35,240
Pro Flowers thought inside the box so you can too.

555
00:33:35,240 --> 00:33:39,560
Your flowers are boxed fresh and delivered fast so that they will last surprisingly longer

556
00:33:39,560 --> 00:33:40,640
seven days at least.

557
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:44,680
I gotta say the ones I got were about a week ago uh if not more and they're looking great

558
00:33:44,680 --> 00:33:47,820
and you know the cool thing about Pro Flowers when they show up it's really it's really

like that because what if you just use shitty threads cool i put a lot of shitty threads

00:40:47,260 --> 00:40:51,320
legally allowed to break into their house just to see if there's a coffin in there that

634
00:40:51,320 --> 00:40:56,200
a second coffin that they sleep in when they're not fighting with their husband i can i can

635
00:40:56,200 --> 00:41:03,680
answer this for you right now griffin okay okay yeah let's take the on out of undead

636
00:41:03,680 --> 00:41:10,220
and just say your neighbor dies are you allowed to then break into their house no still a

637
00:41:10,220 --> 00:41:18,280
crime well hold on hold on if you suspect they've died oh get in to save them yeah well

638
00:41:18,280 --> 00:41:26,480
save them save them with like some real late but clutch cpr if we're in a world where vampires

639
00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:34,600
exist why can i not do some sort of spell yeah okay um so first of all travis was this

640
00:41:34,600 --> 00:41:38,680
a factor in your report that you did in high school which god please tell me you had to

641
00:41:38,680 --> 00:41:43,720
read that in front of the class please tell me other people our teacher was a very kind

642
00:41:43,720 --> 00:41:52,200
understanding very discreet yeah um this is a high risk high whatever the opposite of

643
00:41:52,200 --> 00:41:58,800
a reward is risk i guess it's a high risk high risk sort of situation because you kick

644
00:41:58,800 --> 00:42:05,680
in the door and either they're all there and they're like when they're eating like a you

645
00:42:05,680 --> 00:42:11,200
know they're eating a salad and you're like oh that's not a vampire dracula never get

646
00:42:11,200 --> 00:42:16,000
caught dead eating lettuce and that's a fun joke even that in of itself because he is

647
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:21,800
technically dead and then you would go to jail for probably a bit um and actually i

648
00:42:21,800 --> 00:42:26,960
don't know if you just kick in the door is is it still breaking and entering if you just

649
00:42:26,960 --> 00:42:31,040
sort of break but don't enter well here okay but there's another side of this right would

650
00:42:31,040 --> 00:42:35,120
they press charges because if this person is really trying to live that vampire lifestyle

651
00:42:35,120 --> 00:42:40,480
and you're like sorry i thought you were a vampire wouldn't they be a little flattered

652
00:42:40,480 --> 00:42:46,960
when they'd be a little bit like thank you very much now please leave what if you just

653
00:42:46,960 --> 00:42:52,400
there's easier ways to ascertain this i've griffin mentioned salad knock on the door

654
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:58,920
asked to borrow a cup of lettuce and and if they have that in their house by weight don't

655
00:42:58,920 --> 00:43:04,600
i wait well you have to because are you packing the lettuce in the cup all right you know

656
00:43:04,600 --> 00:43:08,920
what i mean like but you can't give someone a cup of lettuce by weight well i believe

657
00:43:08,920 --> 00:43:14,840
a cup weighs a pound a cup of lettuce weighs a pound okay that's what that's what out in

658
00:43:14,840 --> 00:43:20,000
brown would tell you is that what out in brown person who knows what the fuck lettuce is

659
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:24,000
would tell me about the weight of lettuce like when they say you know which weighs more

660
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:28,480
you know a ton of bricks or a ton of lettuce you know they both weigh a ton yeah that's

661
00:43:28,480 --> 00:43:32,620
irrelevant to what i'm saying now if you're making the argument that we in america should

662
00:43:32,620 --> 00:43:38,040
switch to uh using weight measurements for baking specifically i would completely agree

663
00:43:38,040 --> 00:43:43,400
with you it's really criminal that our recipes by and large are delivered to us in the imperfect

664
00:43:43,400 --> 00:43:50,220
system of uh uh sort of like volume measurements i think that that's a very bad way to bake

665
00:43:50,220 --> 00:43:54,440
and whenever possible i prefer to bake by weight because it's much more precise but

666
00:43:54,440 --> 00:44:00,840
a cup of lettuce does not weigh a pound packed it tight enough i think you could yeah you

667
00:44:00,840 --> 00:44:04,200
could make it weigh a pound you think you could pack lettuce tight enough to make it

668
00:44:04,200 --> 00:44:11,120
weigh a pound in a cup yeah okay well so it vampires uh-huh yeah there's a lot of different

669
00:44:11,120 --> 00:44:15,440
things you can do here obviously ask them to come outside in the daylight you can throw

670
00:44:15,440 --> 00:44:19,520
a garlic at them but that in and of itself i think might be a different crime what if

671
00:44:19,520 --> 00:44:24,560
you just made them like a casserole like yes hey welcome to the neighborhood what are you

672
00:44:24,560 --> 00:44:28,520
talking about i've lived here for 10 years yes sorry but i never brought you this garlicky

673
00:44:28,520 --> 00:44:33,800
lasagna well you wouldn't say that would you you wouldn't say garlicky lasagna would you

674
00:44:33,800 --> 00:44:37,600
say that trev well no you would probably just give them lasagna and then check in to see

675
00:44:37,600 --> 00:44:43,600
if they ate and you put like a pound of garlic in there that assumes that anyone human or

676
00:44:43,600 --> 00:44:50,680
a non-human living or undead would eat a casserole baked by a stranger yeah because no never

677
00:44:50,680 --> 00:44:57,400
not thank you so much for this charming gift dump dump it out so the other thing you can

678
00:44:57,400 --> 00:45:04,960
do is go over and say like i just finished this um this magazine this issue of mother

679
00:45:04,960 --> 00:45:11,720
jones do you want to read it and if they say yes not vampire because vampires staunch conservative

680
00:45:11,720 --> 00:45:18,640
and and so that i'm not saying that all of your like staunch conservative neighbors are

681
00:45:18,640 --> 00:45:22,280
vampires but i'm saying probably about half of them are if you can break in and check

682
00:45:22,280 --> 00:45:26,160
their internet history and you see a lot of judge report and info wars on there you might

683
00:45:26,160 --> 00:45:35,160
be dealing with a vampire you might be a vampire finish the thought finish it now if you suspect

684
00:45:35,160 --> 00:45:41,320
that your neighbor is a no i want the accent i want the accent i want three you might be

685
00:45:41,320 --> 00:45:48,960
a vampire if okay delivered in the style of jeff if you're a fan of the xfl you might

686
00:45:48,960 --> 00:45:53,840
be a vampire yeah you're definitely a vampire they're catering to all night games or else

687
00:45:53,840 --> 00:45:59,260
ticket sales are going to be a real problem there two more if you're hers has a papa john's

688
00:45:59,260 --> 00:46:05,740
light on top of it you might be a vampire thank you jeff wolfworthy one more please

689
00:46:05,740 --> 00:46:11,920
give me trab i'm leaning on you on this one i'm i'm pulling out second if you go to church

690
00:46:11,920 --> 00:46:16,280
every sunday even though it burns your skin off you might be does that work is that a

691
00:46:16,280 --> 00:46:20,760
thing well that's something it's kind of a fun one yeah yeah that's a good one i like

692
00:46:20,760 --> 00:46:25,280
that one because i could tell that joke at church and i'm always looking for new jokes

693
00:46:25,280 --> 00:46:29,720
to tell at church i'm gonna work on that one it's hard to come up with funny stuff when

694
00:46:29,720 --> 00:46:35,680
you can't you know cuss or so much anything and griffin's church jokes are great because

695
00:46:35,680 --> 00:46:41,520
they're delivered during the sermon and sort of over it yeah so as yeah outside of it on

696
00:46:41,520 --> 00:46:46,840
a megaphone when he feels like the sermon is in a lull like he's reading a bible verse

697
00:46:46,840 --> 00:46:51,720
or something and like yeah we've all got the bible man thanks yeah it's the time the big

698
00:46:51,720 --> 00:46:57,520
pastors up there and would say something you know like you know the disciple paul and his

699
00:46:57,520 --> 00:47:03,000
letter to the and then just from the audience which is what you call the crowd at a church

700
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:10,160
you would just hear if you don't finish your garlic lasagna and then i get kicked out again

701
00:47:10,160 --> 00:47:14,600
which you probably don't even realize they will do they'll do that to you if you become

702
00:47:14,600 --> 00:47:18,760
a nuisance you didn't finish the joke so i don't actually know the punchline now you

703
00:47:18,760 --> 00:47:25,320
only started the joke so what would be sort of the rest of it um you might be a redneck

704
00:47:25,320 --> 00:47:29,200
well now that's the other that's jeff foxworthy not jeff wolfworthy no i know but i would

705
00:47:29,200 --> 00:47:34,240
do this justin because it's like a werewolf thing or just because wolf is like fox the

706
00:47:34,240 --> 00:47:40,600
wolf is like fox and also dracula's can change into wolves so that's kind of in the children

707
00:47:40,600 --> 00:47:46,800
of the night listen to the children of the night what beautiful music they make if the

708
00:47:46,800 --> 00:47:51,440
beautiful music your children of the night make is all country western you might be a

709
00:47:51,440 --> 00:47:56,240
vampire now that's good let's go more specific if the beautiful music your children of the

710
00:47:56,240 --> 00:48:03,760
night make is all hank williams senior tunes you might be a vampire hey now what is a man

711
00:48:03,760 --> 00:48:12,960
a miserable pile of secrets but enough have at you might be if your coffin has a big number

712
00:48:12,960 --> 00:48:21,360
three etched in the side you might be a vampire how dare you how dare you justin there's probably

713
00:48:21,360 --> 00:48:26,340
more of these yeah yeah i mean we could probably do a lot but would anybody enjoy it or listen

714
00:48:26,340 --> 00:48:30,800
to it has anyone enjoyed anything we've done so far and i don't just mean in this episode

715
00:48:30,800 --> 00:48:36,440
i mean like in our lives since april 10th 2010 it's impossible to say how about another

716
00:48:36,440 --> 00:48:42,360
question i would love that here it comes i'm currently attending cosmetology school and

717
00:48:42,360 --> 00:48:50,440
i have been for several months now astronauts unfortunately what no unfortunately only

718
00:48:50,440 --> 00:48:55,000
today i've been told our school's graduation ceremony tradition each student on their graduation

719
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:59,160
day gets to pick a song to come out to in front of everyone and they are seated at the

720
00:48:59,160 --> 00:49:03,640
front of the class and complimented by your teachers and peers it's actually quite lovely

721
00:49:03,640 --> 00:49:08,600
my problem is this i've been cheated out of three months to decide on a song three months

722
00:49:08,600 --> 00:49:13,320
in and they're just now telling me i must choose a song to encapsulate my entire being

723
00:49:13,320 --> 00:49:18,080
a song that will be the soundtrack of my arrival to the professional world a song of glory

724
00:49:18,080 --> 00:49:22,360
of the literal blood sweat and tears i've given to graduate brothers how do i pick the

725
00:49:22,360 --> 00:49:26,760
one perfect song that will escort me into the cold embrace of adulthood pump up the

726
00:49:26,760 --> 00:49:31,240
rest of my class for graduation and will represent the essence of me this is the most important

727
00:49:31,240 --> 00:49:35,080
decision of my life also due to an incident that no one will fucking tell me about no

728
00:49:35,080 --> 00:49:40,360
one is allowed to choose party rock anthem thank you thank you for ruling that out bewildered

729
00:49:40,360 --> 00:49:44,560
and beauty school and thank you also for not including any relevant details about yourself

730
00:49:44,560 --> 00:49:49,120
whatsoever that we could use because that definitely does make it easier um well let's

731
00:49:49,120 --> 00:49:55,080
work backwards let's memento this one what happened with party rock right does that one

732
00:49:55,080 --> 00:50:00,480
have foul lyrics in it that maybe they it came on and all the cool professors were like

733
00:50:00,480 --> 00:50:06,480
nice but then there's a part where lmfao is like you know talking about the their apple

734
00:50:06,480 --> 00:50:12,440
jacks or something like that and people are like uh it's crude this this is a big school

735
00:50:12,440 --> 00:50:18,920
i'm i'm currently reviewing um the the tune on genius lyrics which is it seems like they

736
00:50:18,920 --> 00:50:24,280
should have another dough name yeah yeah this is one of my uh just weird facts that i know

737
00:50:24,280 --> 00:50:29,920
about sports and it's not even really directly about sports but there is a cincinnati reds

738
00:50:29,920 --> 00:50:32,960
player i don't even know if he still plays but he was the third baseman his name was

739
00:50:32,960 --> 00:50:37,320
scott rollin um and you know baseball players get to pick their own walkout music when they

740
00:50:37,320 --> 00:50:43,280
walk up to uh to take you know they're at bat and so scott rollin just let his daughter

741
00:50:43,280 --> 00:50:48,320
pick and so like she always picked like justin bieber and like taylor swift and stuff and

742
00:50:48,320 --> 00:50:52,080
that was just like his walkout music and i just think that like that's the best that's

743
00:50:52,080 --> 00:50:56,880
just really fun to me and i just really enjoyed that fact and i wanted to share it with everybody

744
00:50:56,880 --> 00:51:01,840
yeah it's not funny but it's you know nice yeah you can tell that joke at church you

745
00:51:01,840 --> 00:51:07,080
know i could definitely get in front of the crowd during the sermon and do that one it's

746
00:51:07,080 --> 00:51:11,080
kind of a bummer that i can never release an album because the best name for an album

747
00:51:11,080 --> 00:51:15,560
sorry for party rocking is already taken it's already been done and it's nice that they

748
00:51:15,560 --> 00:51:19,320
understand that they have made a mistake wouldn't it be i think it would be better though if

749
00:51:19,320 --> 00:51:26,600
that album wasn't by lmfao it's just like listen i travis mcgraw on behalf of all music

750
00:51:26,600 --> 00:51:33,340
apologize for party rocking all right what's the song what's the song this is interesting

751
00:51:33,340 --> 00:51:40,880
because like you could pick a song that encapsulates you or you could pick pick like an aspirational

752
00:51:40,880 --> 00:51:49,200
song like a song that i like don't stop me now you know is a song of like this is me

753
00:51:49,200 --> 00:51:53,680
this is the me i want to be i mean that's a good answer that's a good answer but it's

754
00:51:53,680 --> 00:51:58,880
not the best answer okay i think i mean you get up there and you do don't stop me now

755
00:51:58,880 --> 00:52:02,960
but just do that one if we say nothing else that is better just do that one because that

756
00:52:02,960 --> 00:52:06,520
is a very good one i think that's going to get the crowd very psyched what's the best

757
00:52:06,520 --> 00:52:14,480
answer though what if you do the graduation song you know the pomp and circumstance okay

758
00:52:14,480 --> 00:52:21,080
i thought you meant as we go either one is fine it's something to placate those fascist

759
00:52:21,080 --> 00:52:28,040
teachers up on our teachers our national treasure a fascist up on stage and then what's that

760
00:52:28,040 --> 00:52:33,760
record scratch and then what's the weather you hear from coming from the crowd party

761
00:52:33,760 --> 00:52:39,920
rock is in the house tonight it's an acapella version you've worked with the entire school

762
00:52:39,920 --> 00:52:43,600
to do the entire thing so what the fuck are they gonna do kick you out no you already

763
00:52:43,600 --> 00:52:46,940
got that piece of paper actually wait till you get the piece of paper yeah because once

764
00:52:46,940 --> 00:52:52,240
that happens that's a legally binding you graduated and now you can't take that from

765
00:52:52,240 --> 00:52:59,240
you no uh you get that and then that's the record scratch noise and that's how they make

766
00:52:59,240 --> 00:53:03,080
it and then coming from the crowd is party rock in the house tonight everybody's gonna

767
00:53:03,080 --> 00:53:09,220
have a good time and you kind of do like stop like you're like wave like putting your hands

768
00:53:09,220 --> 00:53:13,960
like please no i'm not allowed and they're and they're like we're sorry for party rocking

769
00:53:13,960 --> 00:53:19,280
and and then you like join in and then the teachers are like why did we ban this fucking

770
00:53:19,280 --> 00:53:25,660
tune yeah because we're into it and then you start dancing you're dancing and the small

771
00:53:25,660 --> 00:53:31,400
town priest is like oh you know what this is actually flying yeah he takes off his vestments

772
00:53:31,400 --> 00:53:35,460
and you know he's wearing like you know hot pants and a rave shirt and he's like ready

773
00:53:35,460 --> 00:53:41,600
he's ready to go and then it could be a big food fight oh that would be so great and you're

774
00:53:41,600 --> 00:53:46,360
all just doing each other's hair and getting ready to blast off into space and then red

775
00:53:46,360 --> 00:53:51,680
foo and sky blue stand up and they're like hi this is over yeah we're back and they do

776
00:53:51,680 --> 00:53:59,200
a sequel to the song right there still sorry for party rock yes and listen we can't apologize

777
00:53:59,200 --> 00:54:05,840
enough for party rock okay and this one's gonna be even more contrite can i tell you

778
00:54:05,840 --> 00:54:11,480
something i'm looking at the lyrics of party rock anthem there's very little apology happening

779
00:54:11,480 --> 00:54:16,760
here yeah they're not even sorry for party rocking really yeah so it seems like they're

780
00:54:16,760 --> 00:54:21,520
kind of celebrating it and if they really wanted me to believe their bullshit apology

781
00:54:21,520 --> 00:54:26,200
they would have a little little something in here this is like there is an entire song

782
00:54:26,200 --> 00:54:30,920
oh called sorry for party rocking which i think might be better more palatable in terms

783
00:54:30,920 --> 00:54:35,120
of apologies okay i'm looking at the lyrics of this one they do actually say sorry for

784
00:54:35,120 --> 00:54:39,280
party rocking actually a lot in this one so it's a difference on a lot of that i'm looking

785
00:54:39,280 --> 00:54:43,520
at it they say it about 32 times so that's a good song as far as i can tell just look

786
00:54:43,520 --> 00:54:50,320
because it gets the message across yeah that they did it bad so that could work uh bang

787
00:54:50,320 --> 00:54:57,440
a rang by skrillex bang a ring but you can't come out to the drop yeah yeah and that takes

788
00:54:57,440 --> 00:55:02,800
a little while uh it takes a while to get there you have to be done before the drop

789
00:55:02,800 --> 00:55:08,040
so it's just like oh oh go go go go is there a song that has the drop at the beginning

790
00:55:08,040 --> 00:55:13,040
of it and that might be the antithesis of it but i would love it if you know skrillex

791
00:55:13,040 --> 00:55:19,000
was like i got a new song here comes wow and then it's like whoa thank you i didn't have

792
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:22,800
to wait at all you just sort of hit me up front with that and it's weird you didn't

793
00:55:22,800 --> 00:55:26,540
really build up a lot of anticipation and then everything that came after that was actually

794
00:55:26,540 --> 00:55:32,000
pretty disappointing um it's just down to is there a song that has the drop at the very

795
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:41,000
end of it that's just like for like four and a half minutes and it's like and that's the

796
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:45,560
end of the song and it's like oh man i don't know if that would be satisfying either griffin

797
00:55:45,560 --> 00:55:52,080
i don't think edm is sort of your future what about a song that's all drops and so it opens

798
00:55:52,080 --> 00:56:00,000
up and it's like wow hey i'm onto something because i felt that made me want to fucking

799
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:05,480
graduate that that's everybody's favorite part you know so you just have the drop oops

800
00:56:05,480 --> 00:56:12,160
oops all drops the new lmfao album they're back they're back and it's more lmfao is back

801
00:56:12,160 --> 00:56:17,200
but sadly we have to depart this is the end of the episode thank you so much for listening

802
