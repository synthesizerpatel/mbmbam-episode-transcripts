11
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:48,400
T-bird car that's gonna be in a lot of the scenes now and oh is it like a

12
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:55,680
character all its own yeah it's a and it takes place in New York City and yeah

13
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:59,080
and it's that's also kind of a character so you just heard our new theme song

14
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:04,080
it's called my life is better with you by Montaigne who is a very talented

15
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:08,960
artist who you should seek out immediately love to get her in on the

16
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:12,320
show it would be cool if we could get her on the show in the next like 28

17
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:18,960
minutes question comes along yeah yeah like later this episode yeah we'll see

18
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:24,600
yeah yeah it's maybe in the works it's wild it's it's wild enough to me that we

19
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:29,680
know somebody who's competing on Eurovision let alone that we have now

20
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:35,640
worked with somebody and will now be on a weekly basis sort of you know played

21
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:39,600
on by somebody who's gonna be on your vision and do you think that means we

22
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:45,200
can go to Eurovision ticks can we get can we compete will we be able to leave

23
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:52,280
our nation is that is a huge question in America we join Europe can we read

24
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:57,440
sub in sub in the UK's out that's fine sub us in baby I mean if they're

25
00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:03,040
including Australia I'm just saying we're ready why not America let me we'll

26
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:07,800
start out by doing we'll infiltrate some backup dancers for some of the other for

27
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:11,640
some of the smaller countries that don't really have a shot and I feel like we'd

28
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:17,240
really blend in with like say uh-huh let me think maybe like France France yeah I

29
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:21,320
think we could get in there and get like experimental with it and then we'll take

30
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:26,640
off our masks at the end and be like it's us America and we can do it and we

31
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:32,320
can hang out too yeah and oh what's that we're building bridges both figuratively

32
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:37,880
and literally across the Atlantic Ocean yeah oh man you are so cool where's that

33
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:44,440
bridge thank you come on thank you it's 2021 let's build a bridge across the

34
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:55,360
ocean or under the ocean this is what I'm saying rich to Europe back to us

35
00:03:55,360 --> 00:04:00,360
drive in your car you'll go very far hope it don't collapse actually it's a

36
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:07,240
walking it's a it's a walking it's like one of those escalator ground escalator

37
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:12,240
things you just kind of stand on it and you start a little life down there and

38
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:20,040
then like a month and a half later good good evening governor oh you're on the

39
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:24,120
other side here that's means you're on the other side and then we can change it

40
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:28,520
to like oh yeah under the pond and that's what we'll say across the pond

41
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:32,640
it's like oh I came under the pond in the tube and they're like on the subway

42
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:37,120
you're like no in the tube there's a tube it's about like three feet wide and

43
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:42,040
like six and a half feet tall it's very tight very dark do you know there's a

44
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:46,960
special British RSS feed of this show that just has content warnings but in

45
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:52,600
front of every episode everyone the people in Eurovision who are responsible

46
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:55,720
for Eurovision are gonna listen to the last two and a half minutes of this show

47
00:04:55,720 --> 00:05:01,360
and say damn not yet they ain't ready yet to be called I feel like in three

48
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:06,760
minutes we started to establish new bonds and separate them violently oh boy

49
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:11,480
oh boy we should build the bridge over the Atlantic Ocean and then set fire to

50
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:16,560
it as we're driving in the last golden spike I love it hey can we do our show I

51
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:21,160
would love that actually that would be fantastic that would be cool yeah I feel

52
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:24,440
like we haven't done it in a while you know what I mean like I don't think we

53
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:29,440
answered any questions last week yeah did we not I don't know it got rowdy we

54
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:36,160
talked about here's a regular one okay oh my wife and I had our first baby last

55
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:42,640
year a girl she's now ten months old my father-in-law bought her a gift and he's

56
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:46,640
very excited to see her playing with the problem is it's clearly labeled a dog

57
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:52,200
toy oh yeah tag the tag say to keep it away from babies he ordered it online so

58
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:55,400
he may not have noticed this how do I navigate this without hurting his

59
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:58,520
feelings I can't tell him that he actually bought our daughter a dog toy

60
00:05:58,520 --> 00:06:04,640
but I also don't want her to play with a dog toy helicopter parent am I right

61
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:09,440
yeah really and I'm free in California I like the ones where they set it up so

62
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:13,240
that there is no writing here there's two things that could happen both are

63
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:20,080
bad yeah so I've lived this we we were killing time at some strip mall

64
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:24,000
somewhere with Henry and he picked up a dog toy at a pet land we were just kind

65
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,200
of walking around cuz we thought hey maybe he'll look at fish and be

66
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:31,780
distracted for a little bit and he picked up a little little squishy dog

67
00:06:31,780 --> 00:06:37,840
toy and enjoyed it and we took a picture must post it online and then my my my

68
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:43,760
mother and father-in-law sent that toy for Henry and he was like fuck yeah and

69
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:46,960
started to play with it and then we looked at the tag later like this is kid

70
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:53,640
poison this is this dogs love it kids hate it kids bodies hate it dogs bodies

71
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:58,320
can withstand it but don't let a child put this in his mouth whatever you do

72
00:06:58,320 --> 00:07:02,800
whatever you do don't do that so what we did is we immediately took the toy away

73
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:08,240
and we told the parents and we said hey this is funny you got our human child a

74
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:12,400
dog toy and then we all had a good laugh about it and it was a mistake that was

75
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:18,880
never made again so really you gotta say something but make it fun be like you

76
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:23,520
poisoned my child that can be fun and then it's like they're not gonna feel

77
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:27,280
bad cuz it's like a funny joke what kind of toy is it cuz if he got her a

78
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:31,960
Nylabone it might be on purpose maybe he's just being really mean god I hate

79
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:36,760
brushing my son's teeth if I could just toss a Nylabone in there and let that

80
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:43,360
do the work enjoy that would be cool the kids don't appreciate if you've never

81
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:46,800
tried to brush the teeth of a human that does not want their teeth brush yeah

82
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:52,840
that is the one any place where kids can flex nuts they absolutely will right and

83
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:57,360
this is the one place where kids will can absolutely flex nuts on you and they

84
00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:01,960
do every single fucking time yeah if you ever want to feel powerless be brushing

85
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:07,680
a kid's teeth and have them bite down on you're done and I can't pull on it

86
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:12,040
without some like marathon man bullshit that's gonna have you staring into the

87
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:15,960
mirror for the next two hours like questioning who you your very soul yeah

88
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:20,200
like there's no play you just let go of it at that point yeah all right

89
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:23,680
you let your teeth fall out they don't need those teeth anyway that's what I'm

90
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:27,640
saying that's why it's kind of hard we took BB to the dentist you know when it

91
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:30,280
was time cuz we're good parents or whatever and they're like yeah you got

92
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:34,200
to start flossing and I could think it's like ooh I don't know I'll bring her

93
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:40,800
back my friend how often can I bring her in yeah if we just chuck a bone in there

94
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:45,960
and let the bone do the brushing it's weird that there's not a child we got

95
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:51,680
that we got that we got that tech for dogs but I don't have that tech for

96
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:56,080
toddlers that's hey science how's your priorities pretty fucking bad I think

97
00:08:56,080 --> 00:09:01,520
yeah actually thank you also a squeaker inside those things they'd love that I

98
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:05,740
would love that I'm just saying that I bought BB a lot of stuffed animals and

99
00:09:05,740 --> 00:09:09,420
now dot a lot of stuffed animals and very few of them have like tough tech

100
00:09:09,420 --> 00:09:13,880
technology that let him really rag doll him around to get that squeaker out I'm

101
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:17,680
just saying let's keep our kids a little busier and maybe make those true toys

102
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:22,560
last a little bit longer for the kids okay yeah um hey you wanna Yahoo yes

00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:42,080
this in it's yahoo answers user Natalie who asks shipping a horse from Canada

107
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:47,520
to Australia I want to transport my horse from Canada to Australia in a few

108
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:52,160
years he is a gelding and at that time will be for is this dangerous to do can

109
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:57,240
he get sick for it how much will it cost about has anyone else done this that can

110
00:09:57,240 --> 00:10:01,440
give please give me some information on this what are some good company that can

111
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:07,920
do this via ship or by air that can give me a quote gotta get is it and let's go

112
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:12,760
ahead and just say operation Dumbo drop out loud yeah and then we can move on to

113
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:22,140
like more creative waters okay I'm on a plane yeah now that that's out of the

114
00:10:22,140 --> 00:10:29,040
way here's the problem I can think of so many ways to get a horse from Canada to

115
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:36,480
Australia yeah if they can be dead at the oh at the end of oh at the end of it

116
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:40,800
right well I guess the other way around wouldn't work would the other way around

117
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:46,280
you know some like powerful magic unless you kill the horse ship it left ways

118
00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:51,720
over the international date line it shows up in Australia feeling Hale and

119
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:56,280
Hardy no that would be tomorrow fuck no still dead dead for a day it might

120
00:10:56,280 --> 00:11:00,920
actually be easier to shoot the horse up into the sky in a rocket let the earth

121
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:07,520
rotate underneath it rocket come back down oh cool and land in Australia if it

122
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:11,560
goes might be easier and we could really interstellar it and launch around old

123
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:15,200
Jupiter up in the sky and have a cut slingshot all the way back and when it

124
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:20,360
comes back we have it's been ten years on earth but for the horse it's been

125
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:27,920
like nine years and like 11 months and it's still a lot of time it's pretty

126
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:31,960
it's pretty you would need to go how many seats would you have to buy on a

127
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:37,560
plane oh to go with before they let you take the horse on yeah carry on horse

128
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:45,240
yeah I've seen okay for reference yeah I once saw a large pitbull yeah that was

129
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:49,240
like a rescue animal that had been trained to be like an assistive animal

130
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:56,920
right and he I would put him at probably 80 pounds that's a little horse that's

131
00:11:56,920 --> 00:11:59,840
this is what I'm saying so if we scale that up that was like one seat right

132
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:04,180
right so horse is what like 800 pounds that's 10 seats there's gonna be a

133
00:12:04,180 --> 00:12:07,880
four-year-old horse so we're not talking about a little full straight out the out

134
00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:14,120
the gate I'm checking the pet travel page on Delta okay and just control F

135
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:21,120
horse some pets can travel with Delta as a carry-on shipped as very special

136
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:25,560
cargo depending on their size okay review the requirements okay I'm

137
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:31,960
checking the guidelines and requirements okay yeah there's a section here on

138
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:36,920
inappropriate animal behavior so all rude dogs need not apply oh no not this

139
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:43,080
this ponies are real saint it's this ponies a fucking gentleman one of the

140
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:47,320
inappropriate animal behaviors is barking excessively not in response to

141
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:52,400
a handler's needs or distress yeah I want to I did listen it does that dog

142
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:57,720
sense distress because if so I need him to let me in on what the problem is

143
00:12:57,720 --> 00:13:01,360
because we are in an airplane this dog's having a chill time and he's got his

144
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:06,240
favorite tunes plan and it's nice and cool in here but he's being extremely

145
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:10,680
loud art now are we 25,000 feet up in the air and is that uncomfortable for a

146
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:14,400
dog yeah one of the things one of the things that'll get your your pet kicked

147
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:20,040
off the plane is relieving themselves in the gate area or cabin if my dog

148
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:25,200
relieves themselves in the cabin obviously that's clear I actually that's

149
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:28,560
absolutely a hundred percent I'm with you I agree I would love to have this

150
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:31,500
dog off the plane too because it's obviously not working out what is your

151
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:37,920
plan right your ex Phil that's a threat hey yeah we're we're in the middle of

152
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:42,520
the ocean you gotta pop that door open even if you're that serious about it

153
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:46,280
that's putting others in danger I'm gonna steal you directly in the eye but

154
00:13:46,280 --> 00:13:54,600
while Rex pisses in coach there they no longer allow as of January 11th 2021

155
00:13:54,600 --> 00:14:00,440
they no longer allow what are listed here as non-dog service animals I love I

156
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:05,280
think all animals love to think of themselves as non dogs yeah so here's

157
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:10,480
what they don't permit small mammals or pocket pets like hedgehogs or sugar

158
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:16,600
okay that's not a problem this is a huge mammal so we're fine so far no

159
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:20,240
insects or spiders and to be fair I believe I will be the judge of that

160
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:26,120
because you will never know yeah there's no rodents mice rats the

161
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:31,960
hamsters they list they list out rodents mice rats hamsters gerbils guinea pigs I

162
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:36,440
feel like if I'm planning to bring an animal like that on the plane I should

163
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:39,440
at least know if it's a rodent or not right you don't have to specify you

164
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:45,360
don't mention chinchillas interesting now they do have they list here

165
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:51,320
amphibians uh-huh birds obviously they just get competitive right that with the

166
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:57,560
plane animals improperly cleaned or with a foul odor that's fine this this again

167
00:14:57,560 --> 00:15:01,560
this ponies a gentleman it's gonna smell fucking so far we're in the clear yeah

168
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:10,200
this is good so far last one animals with tusks horns or hooves oh gee goats

169
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:15,600
and pigs but does not specifically list horses but they do have hook okay okay

170
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:21,840
I'm just saying some large sneakers yeah never know well but they x-rays so the

171
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:28,400
hooves can the hooves come off for like a minute do they regrow like Tony do

172
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:31,360
they come back and I'm sure this is a horrible thing to say I'm sure it hurts

173
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:35,400
and there's probably some monstrous sort of practice that is being done to

174
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:39,680
horses that is not funny in the least but this isn't fine this is serious

175
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:43,840
we're trying to solve a really serious issue or else this horse is gonna get

176
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:49,840
left behind the horse hang their hooves out the windows and they're not on the

177
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:55,760
plane that's good that's good you could also just bring them to the to the gate

178
00:15:55,760 --> 00:16:03,920
and just be like look at it look at his big wet eyes that animals got hooves ah

179
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:08,680
fuck you're right he does oh well we can still get on right we're still cool

180
00:16:08,680 --> 00:16:12,760
right we're still okay right I can tell you're a pretty cool person who

181
00:16:12,760 --> 00:16:17,400
probably likes a hundred dollars am I right can you imagine get to the gate

182
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:23,040
with your your hoof list sneaker wearing horse that has been through hell and you

183
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:29,600
are walking up the tarmac and then the horse lets out a dookie and you're like

184
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:37,480
we were so close mr. Chamberlain fuck I I just want to say for the record I

185
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:42,120
think that lost would have been 25% better if there had been a horse

186
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:46,920
survivor on the island that had been on the plane the horse lands and then they

187
00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:50,720
just treated it like another it was like there's yeah there's Jack yeah hey

188
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:54,280
there's Sawyer there's more Chamberlain there's her and every time they make

189
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:59,240
horse we gotta get off this island I would love that man I'd be so into that

190
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:03,640
yeah it's making me happy thinking about it one of the things they do list I

191
00:17:03,640 --> 00:17:08,040
want to move from the FAQ page and this doesn't help us necessarily but I did

192
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:11,640
want to mention it they're one of the FAQs is what if I have a service or

193
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:15,960
support animal in training oh and they say that a service animal in training

194
00:17:15,960 --> 00:17:18,960
does not meet qualifications for a trained animal but I do love the idea of

195
00:17:18,960 --> 00:17:22,880
pull it up to the gate be like listen I'm gonna warn you right up front this

196
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:29,280
guy's a fucking loose cannon yeah he will serve he services me for sure but

197
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:32,920
sometimes he goes too far I've asked for his badge and gun repeatedly but he

198
00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:36,880
won't step down I actually have to support animals one of them very by the

199
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:42,440
book yeah he's six months for retirement he's training this new rookie but that

200
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:45,640
rookie cannot be controlled and they butt heads but you know what they get

201
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:48,640
the job done and you're gonna be glad they're on this plane you're gonna be

202
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:53,920
glad they're on this plane yeah you may need some real service done but not maybe

203
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:59,080
off-book service right service they don't teach it service talk yeah cool

204
00:17:59,080 --> 00:18:02,400
recently my girlfriend and I moved into a new house where the landlord

205
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:06,320
conveniently already provides the internet we're both biologists in our

206
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:10,960
late 20s and today discovered that safe search is on through some entirely

207
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:16,200
innocent and work-related web searches how do we ask our landlord to remove

208
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:20,400
safe search without him immediately jumping to the conclusion that we want

209
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:24,840
to desecrate his house with filthy unspeakable pornography that's from not

210
00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:31,280
so lewd lodgers in Leeds UK well my theory my supposition would be that if

211
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:35,720
you have some sort of safe search software enabled some sort of sort of

212
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:39,400
net nanny mm-hmm that there's some sort of whitelisting that you could do right

213
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:44,160
which makes me know I feel like all you have to do is go to your landlord and

214
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:52,240
tell him exactly the nasty URLs that you are going to be exploring yeah this is

215
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:59,760
tough why because yeah I understand that it's probably 99.9 percent of the time

216
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:04,920
not from unspeakable things yeah but what about that point one percent you

217
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:08,760
don't want to go to him about K thanks for letting us look at like I don't know

218
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:13,000
bird genitals or whatever because we're biologists but also but we actually I

219
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:18,440
gotta tell you mark we accidentally did look at a dick today and we need you to

220
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:22,920
tighten up the algorithms mark this is a cool this is a Christian household

221
00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:27,360
that's his deal his deal is he'll turn off safe search but if you it's a

222
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:32,200
otter system yeah you see anything that you're not supposed to you have to let

223
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:36,640
me know and I'll explain it to you yeah I'll make what you saw make sense I

224
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:42,520
promise I won't leave you alone in this hey mark I saw some and they look like

225
00:19:42,520 --> 00:19:47,280
adults doing some stuff to each other like okay sit down I've walked so many

226
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:51,880
tenants through this okay it was the mommy daddy hug do you know what I'm

227
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:58,840
talking about you know mark also our disposals broken the disposals broken

228
00:19:58,840 --> 00:20:02,520
and I can't get my sights to load where they do the special mommy daddy hug can

229
00:20:02,520 --> 00:20:08,360
you come tweak both why are they dancing so hard mark they seem so angry at each

230
00:20:08,360 --> 00:20:15,080
other there's no music if you're like there we're fairly positive that your

231
00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:18,800
landlord is able to see your entire internet history right if this is the

232
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:24,920
setup like 100% right yeah yeah I guess it's literally like this sounds like

233
00:20:24,920 --> 00:20:33,160
you're connected straight to his gmail account yeah you have to go borrow his

234
00:20:33,160 --> 00:20:38,080
his his lappy his laptop the computer is in the dining room that you all share

235
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:42,040
and your landlord is also your dad yeah you just admit it your dad for

236
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:46,760
complimentary internet access you just have to come to my place and ask to use

237
00:20:46,760 --> 00:20:51,200
my book yeah I'll crack it open for you my web book and it's just a sticker on

238
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:56,440
it it just says the internet on it wouldn't the dad lord lets us use the

239
00:20:56,440 --> 00:21:02,880
internet sometimes we see some sites I think you should have a conversation

240
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:07,480
with work about whether he keeps the net nanny on on his computer yes if he's

241
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:13,840
doing that fair you know fair play fair play I was not he needs to let you get

242
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:17,920
all the nasty corners you need ask him if you can pay extra for the dirty

243
00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:21,800
sites in your in your rental agreement well it will increase just like how you

244
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:25,560
have a pet addendum this is just like yeah you can look at whatever you want

245
00:21:25,560 --> 00:21:30,960
for an extra $50 a month let me choose three dirty sites on your premium

246
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:39,320
package that sucks and it should I don't think it's legal I think you should be

247
00:21:39,320 --> 00:21:43,160
able to do something about I don't know who you complain to the better biz the

248
00:21:43,160 --> 00:21:48,320
Better Business Bureau somebody somebody I don't know if they do that in the UK

249
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:53,480
but this there's got to be there has to be an answer to this that we don't know

250
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:56,680
because it's such a preposterous situation it shouldn't be happening do

251
00:21:56,680 --> 00:22:01,000
you have a 14 year old nephew who you could ask for like the creative

252
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:06,440
spellings of words that he uses oh yeah to like search yeah probably hook you up

253
00:22:06,440 --> 00:22:10,520
he's probably got some weird ones he's like have you tried typing in Stiffy

254
00:22:10,520 --> 00:22:19,680
Stiffy sometimes gets through and surprisingly teats works quite often if

255
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:26,880
you tape in teats but not cow sometimes you can get through teats minus cow

256
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:52,360
there's a thin crack in the wall I want to munch I want to munch breaking news

257

00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:13,560
fight has anyone died yet in the chicken sandwich wars not immediately but you

262
00:23:17,560 --> 00:23:25,160

263
00:23:25,160 --> 00:23:32,360
okay out of whoa right that's the highest possible rating right first

264
00:23:32,360 --> 00:23:35,760
let's check in on Zaxby's they got a signature sandwich that is prepping for

266
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:48,280

267
00:23:48,280 --> 00:23:52,480
test market Zaxby's new signature chicken sandwich exceeded the

268
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:59,440
performance of the existing hand-breaded filet by six hundred percent whoa what

00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:03,560
are they what does that is the next sentence yeah so we learned that our old

sandwich sucked shit oh fucking disgusting it was actually just a

271
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:13,200
flip-flop with salt we did not know it was so bad when it comes to portion

272
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:18,960
size flavor and quality ingredients Zaxby's is in it to win it says Joel

273
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:24,460
Bulger CMO while we may not be the largest brand competing in the sandwich

274
00:24:24,460 --> 00:24:29,400
war I'm confident we have the right ingredients to win on taste and make

275
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:34,400
chicken sandwich enthusiasts switch to Zaxby's and we'll literally do whatever

282
00:25:11,060 --> 00:25:15,360
sandwich wars since then numerous brands have entered the fray Zaxby's is

283
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:19,320
actively engaging in the battle of the brands on social media and converting

00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:56,400
mention it because this absolutely inscrutable quote from from a and w with

304
00:26:56,400 --> 00:27:00,840
many of the country's full-service restaurants closed or facing dine-in

305
00:27:00,840 --> 00:27:05,920
restrictions a and w is pleased to offer consumers a variety of popular seafood

306
00:27:05,920 --> 00:27:11,960
options says CEO Kevin Bessner I'm fucking asleep whether what no but like

307
00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:17,000
what's the fucking weather guests enjoy them in our dining rooms that are open

308
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:22,920
or take them home and WC food items are tasty and affordable way to observe

309
00:27:22,920 --> 00:27:26,200
lint it does kind of seem like you're like with many with many restaurants

310
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:32,600
closed we've been watching a lot of TV lately okay

311
00:27:32,600 --> 00:27:36,200
fucking talk about Zach's pieces over here like we taught our employees how to

312
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:44,920
build improvised explosive devices right and here's our last update from burger

313
00:27:44,920 --> 00:27:50,440
phi a chain I'm not familiar then then I and every time you do this Justin where

314
00:27:50,440 --> 00:27:53,800
you bring one that nobody's heard of before it's usually the rowdiest

315
00:27:53,800 --> 00:27:59,120
imaginable thing it's really rowdy after having nationwide success with the spicy

316
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:02,920
fried chicken sandwich burger fight international is launching a new type of

317
00:28:02,920 --> 00:28:12,680
sandwich war what and this one has to do with burgers you can't well imagine if

318
00:28:12,680 --> 00:28:16,480
in the middle of World War two someone's like we're starting World War three like

319
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:24,240
now you let's finish this one first shit yeah burger fires like December 7th is a

320
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:29,920
day that will live in infamy and it is about burgers so this one's about

321
00:28:29,920 --> 00:28:35,120
burgers yeah is the burger fine menu is array of chef inspired selections and

322
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:39,960
high-quality Wagyu beef it was only name it was only natural for the premium fast

323
00:28:39,960 --> 00:28:43,880
casual concept to take it to the next level with a one-of-a-kind spicy burger

324
00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:48,960
sensation whoa the swag burger features double Wagyu and a brisket burger a

325
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:53,640
brisket blend burger charred jalapenos candy ghost pepper bacon to pack the

326
00:28:53,640 --> 00:28:58,800
heat sweet tomato relish to add a bit of sweet habanero pepper jack cheese and

327
00:28:58,800 --> 00:29:03,120
hot steak sauce so it's so I feel like we're in a lot of ingredient territory

328
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:08,960
already right it seems like there may be shooting the cannon into burger fights

329
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:12,960
credit it doesn't go out of sins there is a couple restaurants out there who

330
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:16,840
are so focused on the chicken war that they're not watching their home fronts

331
00:29:16,840 --> 00:29:20,360
you know I mean here comes burger fire like sneaking in the back fuck you all

332
00:29:20,360 --> 00:29:24,920
up y'all so busy worried about chicken we're here with that beef game for the

333
00:29:24,920 --> 00:29:29,400
new product burger fi initiated a consumer research study focused on the

334
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:34,080
initial reaction to the product use utilizing its savory description to test

335
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:39,160
the appeal cool do you understand what I just said we asked people people what's

336
00:29:39,160 --> 00:29:45,680
on the sandwich exactly we described this sandwich would y'all like that

337
00:29:45,680 --> 00:29:49,440
would that good what if we added one more thing to it it says here in the

338
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:59,080
press release do you like it this burger is hot as fuck and I'll melt a hole

339
00:29:59,080 --> 00:30:03,520
through the back of your skull do you want it yeah they conducted a concept

340
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:11,440
test on the flavor build product name and price if they're like okay what if

341
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:15,480
we called it Dave super smash burger that's pretty good what if instead of

342
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:19,360
four pieces of bacon you had three I don't know that seems less good okay no

343
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:22,600
did thank you does okay but Justin that does kind of makes sense as to why it's

344
00:30:22,600 --> 00:30:28,600
called the swag burger why it's called the swag burger oh yeah I'm not there

345
00:30:28,600 --> 00:30:33,480
yet over 2,500 participants were part of the study with approximately 500 people

346
00:30:33,480 --> 00:30:38,320
per concept tested so what they said is they came up with five different rad

347
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:43,440
burgers the research proved invaluable in determining the selection of Wagyu

348
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:49,360
beef versus Angus beef in the burger wow that's a long way of saying that

349
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:53,240
let's check in with Paul Griffin burger fries chief culinary officer the CCO

350
00:30:53,240 --> 00:30:58,440
burger fries foundation is burgers and because the spicy chicken wars have

351
00:30:58,440 --> 00:31:03,360
been part of the cultural conversation over the past few years they're safe I

352
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:07,040
think it's cuz that's the only one they have something more they've picked a

353
00:31:07,040 --> 00:31:10,840
little notch of the war that they could carve out for themselves right well it's

354
00:31:10,840 --> 00:31:14,760
a war on many fronts you have the ground war you have the at sea you have the

355
00:31:14,760 --> 00:31:19,960
sky ground before I see the grilling war yeah the chicken wars have been part of

356
00:31:19,960 --> 00:31:24,080
the cultural conversation over the past few years is that really I mean I know

357
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:27,320
you guys talk about it a lot but I haven't heard a single human being alive

358
00:31:27,320 --> 00:31:31,760
references we've been talking about it a lot Justin well in our little corner of

359
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:35,000
culture which is obviously a biased sample yeah one where you talk about

360
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:40,320
fast food all the time the proc it's this whole thing started as a way to

361
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:45,040
find a new chick-fil-a that everyone can eat without feeling like dog shit about

362
00:31:45,040 --> 00:31:49,320
it and it started out as emotionally started out as something fun and it

363
00:31:49,320 --> 00:31:53,040
started as something virtuous and everybody was just like all hands on

364
00:31:53,040 --> 00:31:56,120
deck but then it turned into well I think Popeye's is the best replacement

365
00:31:56,120 --> 00:31:59,400
well I think Zaxby's is the best replacement and then Popeye's and

366
00:31:59,400 --> 00:32:06,060
Zaxby's was like it's a war baby and it's not we're having fun while thwarting

367
00:32:06,060 --> 00:32:10,200
fucking chick-fil-a but can we remember what it's all about and now other people

368
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:17,400
are talking about like no it's burgers war now it's gonna be car war I will say

369
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:20,640
Griffin that there's still some virtue to it I see a lot of young folks out

370
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:25,000
there they're you know they're recycling their scrap metal they're turning in

371
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:29,440
their nylons to support the troops out there sure everybody's a part of this

372
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:35,680
effort Griffin I won't sit here and let you besmirch the honor yeah of our

373
00:32:35,680 --> 00:32:39,640
troops you know what I mean and Griffin I think maybe if you had a little bit

374
00:32:39,640 --> 00:32:45,040
more patriotism thank you um it cared a little bit more about the chicken wars

375
00:32:45,040 --> 00:32:49,200
just let me wrap this up please Paul Griffin is not done Paul Griffin could

376
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:52,920
have stopped there but instead Paul Griffin continued once we had the idea

377
00:32:52,920 --> 00:32:58,360
of the spicy burger it was fun to start playing with ingredients and texture it

378
00:32:58,360 --> 00:33:03,280
was the best day of my life it was so fun this has been actually super fun the

379
00:33:03,280 --> 00:33:07,560
candy ghost pepper bacon is perfect for those guests are more adventurous and

380
00:33:07,560 --> 00:33:13,560
that makes with the boldness of Wagyu and the creamy and this and the kick of

381
00:33:13,560 --> 00:33:19,280
habanero pepper jack cheese it really rounds out the burger to make it one of

382
00:33:19,280 --> 00:33:25,080
the most flavorful menu items at burger fight and you could tell the person like

383
00:33:25,080 --> 00:33:30,120
dictating this it was just like still nodding and maybe Paul was like um I say

384
00:33:30,120 --> 00:33:34,040
something else or are we okay that seems like enough that's good yeah I should

385
00:33:34,040 --> 00:33:37,680
stop there taking this while sitting on the toilet they had been sitting on for

386
00:33:37,680 --> 00:33:43,640
the last hour and a half trying to pass one of these through their system but

387
00:33:43,640 --> 00:33:50,160
then Julio Ramirez the burger fight CEO yeah he heard Paul fucking bomb right so

388
00:33:50,160 --> 00:33:55,040
he throws open the door he's like hold on let me take this one the swag burger

389
00:33:55,040 --> 00:33:59,640
takes our unique Wagyu beef offering featured in our CEO burger and it kicks

390
00:33:59,640 --> 00:34:03,360
it up a notch with different textures and flavors that create a daring

391
00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:08,520
spiciness with each bite is there anyone above the CEO who can kick in another

392
00:34:08,520 --> 00:34:16,760
door behind him hey it's me it's me the owner of burger fire Justin McElroy I

393
00:34:16,760 --> 00:34:20,640
want to tell you about this burger and that's how we find out the truth

394
00:34:20,640 --> 00:34:24,600
creating the spicy burger sensation is another example of how we're

395
00:34:24,600 --> 00:34:29,240
redefining the way world eats burgers okay oh boy

396
00:34:29,240 --> 00:34:35,520
burger fi will always find ways to continue to grow pioneer trends and

397
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:40,640
create iconic offerings as part of our mission to provide the best burger

398
00:34:40,640 --> 00:34:46,400
experience okay damn I could go for a burger no yeah I get I mean that's the

399
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:53,080
one that's the terrible part about this segment is I always end up extremely

400
00:34:53,080 --> 00:34:57,440
yeah do you know what this is gonna be the worst outcome for burger fi is that

401
00:34:57,440 --> 00:35:03,640
no one will rise to their challenge no one will even acknowledge that they have

402
00:35:03,640 --> 00:35:08,440
attempted to start a burger war and if and life's just gonna go on without

403
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:12,960
burger fi sort of being a part of it and that's him that's gonna be embarrassing

404
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:15,920
they're gonna have to get more thirsty with these press releases

405
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:21,060
Julio Ramirez was a Burger King for 26 years then he knows what he's doing he

406
00:35:21,060 --> 00:35:25,340
knows what he's oh yeah he's better get said at your fucking parent he came in

407
00:35:25,340 --> 00:35:30,400
in October 2020 okay are you kidding me can you think of a more challenging time

408
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:35,360
to step into these waters Julio doesn't give a shit anyway that's

409
00:35:35,360 --> 00:35:39,800
that's a update please let me know if you tried different chicken sandwiches

410
00:35:39,800 --> 00:35:45,960
you can just tweet those at Barack Obama and you know maybe he would like to know

411
00:35:45,960 --> 00:35:49,480
about it or you could to him at me if you want I just always like to try to

412
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:52,760
get people to tweet an Obama because I bet he's lonely right now you don't have

413
00:35:52,760 --> 00:35:57,160
presidents have to do anymore yeah do you think he's ever like Joe do you

414
00:35:57,160 --> 00:36:02,760
need any help I president stuff today hey Joe I don't want to be I don't want

415
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:05,680
to be a dickhead joke but when I was president I let you help me with stuff

416
00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:14,240
yeah so just doesn't it seem like maybe I could come by you're in office I'll

417
00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:18,320
let you hang out help me with different stuff so maybe you just got I mean the

418
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:22,640
kids are growing up now Joe there I did give you that big medal

419
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:27,600
Joe look at it you remember so we're gonna take a quick break and right now

420
00:36:27,600 --> 00:36:31,880
and then we'll come back with more great content until then let's kick it over to

421
00:36:31,880 --> 00:36:34,520
the money zone

422
00:36:46,600 --> 00:36:51,360
stamps are great you can put them on mail to make the mail go places and you

423
00:36:51,360 --> 00:36:55,760
can collect them and create decks of stamps that you battle against other

424
00:36:55,760 --> 00:37:01,520
folks for their stance that lasts forever sure yeah there's stamps that

425
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:07,120
lasts forever and then there's hollow hollow foil ones yeah and they're chase

426
00:37:07,120 --> 00:37:11,360
there's chase stamps and those can be fun but going you know it's not fun it's

427
00:37:11,360 --> 00:37:14,600
just going to the post office when you're not feeling like it well stance

428
00:37:14,600 --> 00:37:19,200
calm is gonna keep you from having to make such a dreary afternoon of it

429
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:23,640
because they let you print off postage right there it's your freaking computer

430
00:37:23,640 --> 00:37:26,760
you can send letters or packages and you can pay a lot less with discounted rates

431
00:37:26,760 --> 00:37:35,800
from USPS UPS and more so it cuts out a lot of the BS yeah I think and yeah

432
00:37:35,800 --> 00:37:41,160
whoever do a stamps calm and so good that they'll put us on stamps oh man

433
00:37:41,160 --> 00:37:46,560
though we could probably get them to put us on stamps calm like a picture of us

434
00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:49,800
like having a great time battling our stamps against each other but I don't

435
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:53,240
know if they would actually put us on the postage itself I want to be on the

436
00:37:53,240 --> 00:37:57,120
postage I want to do that that feels like a cool thing that not everybody

437
00:37:57,120 --> 00:38:02,440
gets to do right well gotta be president or go to space and make a big space

438
00:38:02,440 --> 00:38:06,000
so much work though can I just do a really good ad read in the middle of my

439
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:10,800
podcast you gotta invent some medicine go to space and make a space discovery

440
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:18,120
or be the president trap they got discounts up to 40% off post office

441
00:38:18,120 --> 00:38:23,200
rates and up to 62% off UPS shipping rates it's a wild deal and if you ship a

00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:27,040
lot of stuff you should I assume you're already using stamps calm but if not

502
00:43:33,680 --> 00:43:38,400
I'm a college student and decided to spontaneously bleach my hair at home

503
00:43:38,400 --> 00:43:44,440
it's kind of a disaster flash forwards now I want to get it cut but I'm

504
00:43:44,440 --> 00:43:49,260
absolutely terrified the hairdresser will somehow find a way to yell at me

505
00:43:49,260 --> 00:43:54,200
for bleaching my hair at home what should I do if I get bombarded with guilt from

506
00:43:54,200 --> 00:44:02,160
a professional that's from son of a bleach in Ohio there is no one in the

507
00:44:02,160 --> 00:44:05,000
contiguous United States of America that would know how to answer this question

508
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:12,760
I'm going through my US contacts I'm fucking coming up empty oh you know who

509
00:44:12,760 --> 00:44:17,560
can help yeah we could reach across the pond and then down through the bigger

510
00:44:17,560 --> 00:44:25,560
pond across the pond a sort of diagonal vertex across many pond let's just call

511
00:44:25,560 --> 00:44:29,480
call Australia I think it's like I know it's like Friday there what do you

512
00:44:29,480 --> 00:44:33,600
yeah it's Friday so sure I didn't have the answer Montaigne we'll just call

513
00:44:33,600 --> 00:44:39,320
Montaigne who created who created the my brother my brother me theme song yeah

514
00:44:39,320 --> 00:44:43,160
right there you heard earlier so let's just call hold on don't forget to dial

515
00:44:43,160 --> 00:44:45,800
the extra numbers oh thanks now you're saying you great

516
00:44:45,800 --> 00:45:08,680
extra number thing I didn't bring bring hey hello it's Montaigne hi Montaigne

517
00:45:08,680 --> 00:45:13,320
I'm Justin McElroy you probably saw that on the caller ID though I'm actually

518
00:45:13,320 --> 00:45:19,880
you know so I don't have it saved but I'll wait yeah no I'll do it give me a

519
00:45:19,880 --> 00:45:26,740
sec all of our guests do this I did it really very very uncomfortable for me

520
00:45:26,740 --> 00:45:35,840
and Travis if he asked you about LinkedIn just hang up thank you so much for for

521
00:45:35,840 --> 00:45:41,800
answering this I think unsolvable paradox for us and also for writing one

522
00:45:41,800 --> 00:45:54,120
one real slap in tune slap a rip the first thing is now that I'm 40 there's

523
00:45:54,120 --> 00:45:59,680
literally no good way for me to refer to a piece of music I mean like there's

524
00:45:59,680 --> 00:46:09,040
not there's nothing that is it woefully sort of antiquated or like sweaty beyond

525
00:46:09,040 --> 00:46:13,040
all recognition yeah that's why I just lean into it at this point and I just

526
00:46:13,040 --> 00:46:16,840
say like this is a swinging to but I have to hear you say I have to hear you

527
00:46:16,840 --> 00:46:24,960
say that cost the real human cost Montaigne you have hair I actually I have

528
00:46:24,960 --> 00:46:34,240
I've pretty little hair at the moment I have a buzz cut and it's yeah sorry but

529
00:46:34,240 --> 00:46:37,080
you've met you've met you've messed around with your hair probably at

530
00:46:37,080 --> 00:46:44,200
different times you know others with hair how do you deal with okay you're in a

531
00:46:44,200 --> 00:46:48,580
professional setting I know I just want to say I know that the concedes that we

532
00:46:48,580 --> 00:46:52,400
need in Montaigne's Hell on this I also have dyed hair I'm just gonna say no

533
00:46:52,400 --> 00:46:57,640
it's not the same Montaigne you're a professional setting with people how do

534
00:46:57,640 --> 00:47:02,920
you how do you deal okay I'll give you I'll re I'll refigure it for like your

535
00:47:02,920 --> 00:47:10,120
experience when you're talking to a nobody like ourselves about music and

536
00:47:10,120 --> 00:47:14,200
you know so much about music yeah where where are you at with that are you in

537
00:47:14,200 --> 00:47:18,080
like a judgmental place usually are you in a place where you're like wanting to

538
00:47:18,080 --> 00:47:24,160
help where are you at definitely not um definitely not judgmental that I yeah

539
00:47:24,160 --> 00:47:29,880
yeah music is for everyone you know no matter how much knowledge or wisdom is

540
00:47:29,880 --> 00:47:35,360
involved it is you know to be shared and loved in whatever way that each

541
00:47:35,360 --> 00:47:42,440
individual person wants it to be shared and loved and I think like you guys good

542
00:47:42,440 --> 00:47:47,240
with that love music I think so definitely no judgment there very nice

543
00:47:47,240 --> 00:47:51,720
I think that's very pleasant if you go to a hairdresser with a bad home bleached

544
00:47:51,720 --> 00:47:56,800
on they're not going to be angry at you they're going to judge you and feel bad

545
00:47:56,800 --> 00:48:01,560
for you it's going to be you're gonna hear a lot of oh yeah to carry the

546
00:48:01,560 --> 00:48:05,920
analogy when I'm sure when Montaigne heard my Rugrats theme song for the

547
00:48:05,920 --> 00:48:11,840
show Montaigne what didn't send me an email like you suck shit yeah don't do

548
00:48:11,840 --> 00:48:18,000
music I genuinely loved I genuinely loved the Rugrats cover quite frankly I

549
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:24,720
thought it was so nice if you loved it so much Montaigne we're gonna need that

550
00:48:24,720 --> 00:48:32,120
huge novelty check back that we left on your on your back for now just forward

551
00:48:32,120 --> 00:48:40,880
that to class what's your approach to hair do you just feel like you were

552
00:48:40,880 --> 00:48:44,240
talking about you keep it very short right now is that just like the look you

553
00:48:44,240 --> 00:48:47,240
like do you experiment a lot do you just say like hey whatever just sort of

554
00:48:47,240 --> 00:48:50,320
entertains you right now that's what I'm going with I've had the same haircut

555
00:48:50,320 --> 00:48:57,080
since I was six my approach is fairly impulsive I'd say for the Eurovision

556
00:48:57,080 --> 00:49:02,840
stuff in particular I had a very particular aesthetic that I wanted which

557
00:49:02,840 --> 00:49:10,560
was have really short buzz cut hair that is like ultra colorful so my hair for

558
00:49:10,560 --> 00:49:15,440
Eurovision will be quite rainbow and buzz cut it but like a year ago my hair

559
00:49:15,440 --> 00:49:20,200
was just like natural color like short but not buzz cut and then the year

560
00:49:20,200 --> 00:49:24,120
before that was blue it was quite long and the year before that was pink so

561
00:49:24,120 --> 00:49:29,040
just like whatever I feel like really must be nice keeping keeping everybody's

562
00:49:29,040 --> 00:49:33,280
heads on swivel exactly I made the mistake of having my purple hair become

563
00:49:33,280 --> 00:49:37,480
part of our merchandise and now Justin and Griffin won't let me change it you

564
00:49:37,480 --> 00:49:41,240
know you mentioned Eurovision I that's such a coincidence because your your

565
00:49:41,240 --> 00:49:48,920
Eurovision track see even track like track my mouth it turns to actual my

566
00:49:48,920 --> 00:49:55,360
lips Technicolor is the name of the song the video came out today as we're

567
00:49:55,360 --> 00:50:00,520
recording this I gotta go almost go as you're listening to it it's called

568
00:50:00,520 --> 00:50:04,560
Technicolor you can find it on YouTube I think it's streaming on Spotify

569
00:50:04,560 --> 00:50:10,280
Eurovision that's massive congratulations thank you it is big in a

570
00:50:10,280 --> 00:50:17,080
way that I find rather intimidating really yeah oh my god I'm like no not

571
00:50:17,080 --> 00:50:24,000
really big I know it's big you seem so cool and confident I think I mostly am I

572
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:29,800
think every like other week my anxiety will start to like build up there a

573
00:50:29,800 --> 00:50:34,560
little bit just because like there's a lot I think the issue is that there's

574
00:50:34,560 --> 00:50:39,720
this enormous compression of like time and the number of things that we can get

575
00:50:39,720 --> 00:50:42,600
done in a certain number of time and you want to do things well and when you don't

576
00:50:42,600 --> 00:50:47,040
have time it's hard to do that in a way that is like foolproof so that's been

577
00:50:47,040 --> 00:50:55,640
a bit of a stress oh yeah thanks for wasting time on our song this to God

578
00:50:55,640 --> 00:50:58,680
literally a dream come true we're gonna talk about that and just one second I

579
00:50:58,680 --> 00:51:02,280
want to talk about Technicolor for one more second cuz it is so fucking good

580
00:51:02,280 --> 00:51:05,840
and if you go listen to it you're gonna listen to it on repeat everybody on our

581
00:51:05,840 --> 00:51:10,960
staff has been listening to it literally constantly sharing the be around we are

582
00:51:10,960 --> 00:51:16,600
in love with it I I want to ask you I was watching the the performance video

583
00:51:16,600 --> 00:51:22,360
today that did you wish at any point while you have been recording in this

584
00:51:22,360 --> 00:51:27,840
and do you ever wish you put fewer notes in it because maybe you guys sing a lot

585
00:51:27,840 --> 00:51:32,760
of notes in front of like but a bajillion people on a massive stage

586
00:51:32,760 --> 00:51:36,880
you're like god I put a lot of notes in this mother fucking five notes not five

587
00:51:36,880 --> 00:51:42,040
but certainly not this many it's a lot honestly there is very little time to

588
00:51:42,040 --> 00:51:44,800
breathe in the song which is quite difficult because we have organized

589
00:51:44,800 --> 00:51:49,680
this choreography for it as well I think like all of it is manageable if I

590
00:51:49,680 --> 00:51:59,160
stand still but I've I've opted I've opted not to which country are you most

591
00:51:59,160 --> 00:52:05,160
gunning for yeah yeah I don't know if you guys paid any attention to Eurovision

592
00:52:05,160 --> 00:52:12,960
last year but Iceland put forward the most ripping guys like absolutely

593
00:52:12,960 --> 00:52:15,660
fantastic god it makes you mad how good it is

594
00:52:15,660 --> 00:52:19,920
Jimmy comes up listen this fucking song it's amazing and the video and the

595
00:52:19,920 --> 00:52:24,840
conceit like it's about his unborn or like too little to have any

596
00:52:24,840 --> 00:52:30,680
consciousness kid who's wondering about the thoughts of and it's just like so

597
00:52:30,680 --> 00:52:35,040
sweet and the video is so funny it's just he's amazing I'm actually a huge

598

599
00:52:39,240 --> 00:52:43,520

600
00:52:43,520 --> 00:52:45,920
like Eurovision I don't care and just be quiet for a

601
00:52:45,920 --> 00:53:14,400
second unbelievable but you're gonna beat their ass beat them all the way

602
00:53:14,400 --> 00:53:19,680
back to Iceland um hey let's talk about the my brother my brother me theme song

603
00:53:19,680 --> 00:53:31,040
which I guess is not gonna be called I titled it in the file I sent to you my

604
00:53:31,040 --> 00:53:36,400
life and then in brackets is better with you exclamation mark from my brother my

605
00:53:36,400 --> 00:53:43,320
brother and we can work on that we can Sufjan it up a bit and just be like in

606
00:53:43,320 --> 00:53:49,000
brackets just be like a fateful occurrence on the shores of the on the

607
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:55,960
great wide Mississippi exactly yeah what what is amazing about your song is we

608
00:53:55,960 --> 00:54:01,920
had a very I mean it couldn't have been a more abstract brief that we slid across

609
00:54:01,920 --> 00:54:06,160
your proverbial desk I didn't find it abstract at all actually I thought was

610
00:54:06,160 --> 00:54:11,280
really clear oh well that's good to hear but you really I mean we told you sort

611
00:54:11,280 --> 00:54:18,200
of kind of what we were in the market for and it's like you reach into our

612
00:54:18,200 --> 00:54:22,760
brains and found a song that somehow fulfilled all of it without us being

613
00:54:22,760 --> 00:54:27,960
able to like actually articulate any of that so how'd you do that I guess is my

614
00:54:27,960 --> 00:54:34,400
question which is I mean I am your demo like I was already a listener of the

615
00:54:34,400 --> 00:54:40,960
show for like a few years and like I'm into comedy and Sam and my partner

616
00:54:40,960 --> 00:54:47,000
writes funny things and yeah I guess like that's already a genre and a type

617
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:51,760
of music that I'm familiar with and amenable to and enjoy making a lot and

618
00:54:51,760 --> 00:54:56,320
also like there's a bit of a 2000s revival happening right and like let's

619
00:54:56,320 --> 00:55:03,280
sort of based on the brief I what I imagined was a kind of like high school

620
00:55:03,280 --> 00:55:09,120
coming-of-age like comedy film where it's like incredibly corny and but very

621
00:55:09,120 --> 00:55:16,640
like instead of being about awful boys who do terrible things in high school it

622
00:55:16,640 --> 00:55:20,320
was gonna be about like these two friends who like meet each other and

623
00:55:20,320 --> 00:55:28,200
they just generally oh hello my cat captain poodles has just walked in yeah

624
00:55:28,200 --> 00:55:31,360
it was just gonna be about like two wholesome friends who like meet each

625
00:55:31,360 --> 00:55:35,200
other enjoy each other's company and then realize like oh this is really

626
00:55:35,200 --> 00:55:39,280
great and my life is is nice and I thought that was that fit the vibe of

627
00:55:39,280 --> 00:55:43,120
the show yeah it's great who's the friend who's the friends and I get like

628
00:55:43,120 --> 00:55:48,760
if we're gonna miss to miss if you want sir I can make no no no because I want

629
00:55:48,760 --> 00:55:52,560
this to be like the who's the me and my brother my brother and me I we need more

630
00:55:52,560 --> 00:55:58,240
we need more mystique around our show at this point we've given so much away it

631
00:55:58,240 --> 00:56:02,760
makes me you know the fact the first time I thought about it listen to the

632
00:56:02,760 --> 00:56:09,200
song and this is so I don't know this is perhaps overly modeling but um it it

633
00:56:09,200 --> 00:56:14,400
really exemplifies the way that not how I think about my brother is really at

634
00:56:14,400 --> 00:56:20,000
all but okay that's kind of a zero sum but how I think about our our listeners

635
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:24,480
like the people who listen to the show like it really captures my the

636
00:56:24,480 --> 00:56:29,240
exuberance I have for like making stuff for them and because of the pandemic

637
00:56:29,240 --> 00:56:34,640
like the extent to which I have missed seeing people like seeing people that

638
00:56:34,640 --> 00:56:38,320
like listen to our stuff and meeting our listeners who are kind of like an

639
00:56:38,320 --> 00:56:43,640
extended family for us like it really captured that that sense I have like not

640
00:56:43,640 --> 00:56:47,840
kind of a little bit of the the bittersweet part of like missing seeing

641
00:56:47,840 --> 00:56:50,880
them and missing seeing them in person and doing shows for them but also like

642
00:56:50,880 --> 00:56:56,360
how how much they have improved our life just by listening to our stuff it really

643
00:56:56,360 --> 00:57:00,720
captures that energy I didn't get that at all cool that's all right that's

644
00:57:00,720 --> 00:57:04,960
music for you huh it just made it made me miss going to the movies you know what

645
00:57:04,960 --> 00:57:10,320
I mean like why'd you have to cut out my rap verse yeah let's talk about the

646
00:57:10,320 --> 00:57:13,480
third and fourth and fifth verses that we wrote for the song that you did not

647
00:57:13,480 --> 00:57:16,440
include you know what Griffin we'll include it now Griffin if you just want

648
00:57:16,440 --> 00:57:20,760
to do it yeah well the problem is in the note that I got back from Montana and I

649
00:57:20,760 --> 00:57:24,200
thought it was fair and I didn't have an answer to it she said this is mostly

650
00:57:24,200 --> 00:57:30,600
numbers right I said that's I guess you have a good point there I hadn't thought

651
00:57:30,600 --> 00:57:34,640
about it is that this this verse is most it's more numbers than words and it is

652
00:57:34,640 --> 00:57:41,320
basically math equation and you did and you said that doesn't match the vibe and

653
00:57:41,320 --> 00:57:49,480
I took that I took that very personally yeah I'm sorry but sometimes the truth

654
00:57:49,480 --> 00:57:55,000
hurts and you're just gonna live with it and and and grow strong and move on you

655
00:57:55,000 --> 00:58:01,320
know do you think it's weird Martin that your song technicolor includes the line

656
00:58:01,320 --> 00:58:09,160
yeah I promise you yes all you nasty dudes and that's not in our song it

657
00:58:09,160 --> 00:58:18,240
seems impossible that you wrote that lyric but it's not part of our again it

658
00:58:18,240 --> 00:58:22,420
didn't feel like it fit the vibe of the song but again if we do a remix and I'm

659
00:58:22,420 --> 00:58:29,720
happy to splice the two and make a technicolor move in BAM themed mashup I

660
00:58:29,720 --> 00:58:34,360
want to do a remix of the song that's just this song exactly as it is but it

661
00:58:34,360 --> 00:58:40,440
includes clips from the show interspersed like they do I'm like Batman Michael

662
00:58:40,440 --> 00:58:46,640
Keaton come in like of good good work last time you all watch the kids from a

663
00:58:46,640 --> 00:58:51,120
rose music video because it's just shots from the movie interspersed with seal

664
00:58:51,120 --> 00:58:55,460
like standing next to like a floodlight and it's all lit the same as the movie

665
00:58:55,460 --> 00:59:01,240
clip yeah like so it's like seal is on it I'm on an adjacent rooftop I'm

666
00:59:01,240 --> 00:59:08,200
watching Batman and Nicole Kidman Montaigne what's next for you obviously

667
00:59:08,200 --> 00:59:12,880
very focused on Eurovision that's gonna be this spring and then what's what's

668
00:59:12,880 --> 00:59:19,400
what's after that um maybe album three I guess last year I made a lot of music

669
00:59:19,400 --> 00:59:24,880
with the same guy who did the theme song and who did the Eurovision song and I

670
00:59:24,880 --> 00:59:28,760
think it's probably it's probably adding up to a third album which I'm excited

671
00:59:28,760 --> 00:59:35,080
about who is that who is that that did his name's Dave Hammer Dave Hammer yeah

672
00:59:35,080 --> 00:59:43,120
he's a key guy his name is Dave Hammer and you waited now to mention it he his

673
00:59:43,120 --> 00:59:49,560
name is Dave Hammer well his real name is David Haddad but his his like former

674
00:59:49,560 --> 00:59:55,080
official sort of name is Dave Hammer both great names his real name is dr.

675
00:59:55,080 --> 01:00:04,960
smashing style but yeah so just like a lot of hammer based music production in

676
01:00:04,960 --> 01:00:10,440
the studio that's not true no he's a really awesome lovely person who

677
01:00:10,440 --> 01:00:16,080
listens to all my crazy ideas and yeah just so easy to work with and we've made

678
01:00:16,080 --> 01:00:20,800
really really cool stuff like over the last year which I'm really excited about

679
01:00:20,800 --> 01:00:26,280
and hopefully can do more of this coming well I we're so thrilled to have you as

680
01:00:26,280 --> 01:00:32,040
part of our sort of extended extended extended family and I stuttered that I

681
01:00:32,040 --> 01:00:35,240
didn't mean to say extended seven times because it really it really imbued it

682
01:00:35,240 --> 01:00:45,920
with a distance and arms reach that I do live very far away but oh my god Montaigne

683
01:00:45,920 --> 01:00:50,680
when we do get down there to or over there it's kind of down it's basically

684
01:00:50,680 --> 01:00:55,040
down it's a perspective in it but when we get down there we'll do a shot you

685
01:00:55,040 --> 01:01:00,240
will do a show together it's gonna be great I just gonna say really quickly as

686
01:01:00,240 --> 01:01:04,760
well I recently did an interview from like the Mardi Gras event with Courtney

687
01:01:04,760 --> 01:01:09,640
Act who's this amazing drag queen and was done on top of the Harbour Bridge

688
01:01:09,640 --> 01:01:14,520
and what was so funny to me it was like entering the facility where they like

689
01:01:14,520 --> 01:01:17,480
hosts the Harbour Bridge climbs and stuff like that they have all these

690
01:01:17,480 --> 01:01:21,240
pictures of like all these celebrities who've done the bridge climb and I

691
01:01:21,240 --> 01:01:25,880
forgot like how much of a staple of like tourism and like celebrities visiting

692
01:01:25,880 --> 01:01:29,960
Australia that was like doing the bridge climb because like everyone like the

693
01:01:29,960 --> 01:01:34,960
village people had a photo there and like Danny Radcliffe when he was 11 and

694
01:01:34,960 --> 01:01:38,000
like all these people it was very funny anyway you guys go to the bridge climb

695
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:43,360
and I climb a bridge sure yeah absolutely okay we got a bridge here

696
01:01:43,360 --> 01:01:48,520
that Montaigne all right over we've all got breaks over the New River to West

697
01:01:48,520 --> 01:01:54,800
Virginia it's over the New River Gorge which is a just a massive thing very

698
01:01:54,800 --> 01:02:00,800
deep hole like really gorgeous it's a deep hole and it's weird the weirdest

699
01:02:00,800 --> 01:02:06,360
thing about it is there's this thing called bridge day where for one not real

700
01:02:06,360 --> 01:02:14,400
for one day it's legal to jump off the bridge like yeah but very localized to

701
01:02:14,400 --> 01:02:18,480
be clear jump off the bridge like with a parachute yeah with the parachute or

702
01:02:18,480 --> 01:02:23,400
base jump or whatever your flavor is but there's this I don't know how I just

703
01:02:23,400 --> 01:02:27,240
wish I had been there when it started so he's like okay everybody I've

704
01:02:27,240 --> 01:02:33,640
adopted to make a sheriff everyone can jump off the bridge today asking that's

705
01:02:33,640 --> 01:02:37,920
really funny that's great thank you so much for for being with us and thanks

706
01:02:37,920 --> 01:02:42,840
for the help and thanks for writing our song where can people find more Montaigne

707
01:02:42,840 --> 01:02:48,120
oh man so many places there's obviously like you said like my music streams on

708
01:02:48,120 --> 01:02:51,320
Spotify but it also you know Apple music and you should build all that stuff I

709
01:02:51,320 --> 01:02:55,720
also twitch stream and I like make music live on my twitch often I haven't

710
01:02:55,720 --> 01:02:59,280
streamed for a while because I've been so tanked with like Eurovision stuff but

711
01:02:59,280 --> 01:03:03,920
me my partner also sometimes just play games and I also have a discord if

712
01:03:03,920 --> 01:03:06,760
anyone wants to join the disco it's a really wholesome lovely place we've

713
01:03:06,760 --> 01:03:10,800
mostly just sent each other pictures of like our animals gosh what else I think

714
01:03:10,800 --> 01:03:15,360
that's kind of it and like if you live in Australia or in Sydney you'll

715
01:03:15,360 --> 01:03:17,960
probably see me around on the street because I've got the brightest head

719
01:03:38,320 --> 01:03:41,760
quick before we wrap up I just shared a link and the slack I want you guys to

720
01:03:41,760 --> 01:03:45,840
look at this tweet because just real quick I want you to think about what the

721
01:03:45,840 --> 01:03:49,760
implications of this are I've never watched The Masked Singer before but

722
01:03:49,760 --> 01:03:56,840
apparently it was revealed that the giant snail contained well you see in

723
01:03:56,840 --> 01:04:02,640
the video a celebrity and it was this really weird reveal and then the

724
01:04:02,640 --> 01:04:06,320
celebrity in the giant snail when you guys see it just say it out loud hey

725
01:04:06,320 --> 01:04:12,320
kidding me with this this is so unfair

726
01:04:12,320 --> 01:04:16,320
spoilers for The Masked Singer but the giant snail was Kermit the Frog what

727
01:04:16,320 --> 01:04:21,120
does that mean what does that mean hey how was anybody supposed to fucking

728
01:04:21,120 --> 01:04:26,520
guess that how what is that wait what does that mean but Kermit the Frog who's

729
01:04:26,520 --> 01:04:32,560
Kermit yes thank you but it wasn't Kermit it was the person it was that's not
