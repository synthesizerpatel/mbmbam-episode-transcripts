1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:30,800
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:47,040
Hi everybody, I'm Justin McElroy. I'm Travis McElroy.

6
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:50,480
And I'm Ray Romano, because we're going to talk about married life,

7
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:54,640
and I thought that it would be fun if I was Ray Romano for a while.

8
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:57,600
This is My Brother, My Brother, Me. It's an advice show for the modern era. Travis,

9
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:02,080
you've been married for almost exactly one week now.

10
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:03,920
Yeah, a little over a week, actually.

11
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:05,600
Just a touch over a week.

12
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:06,800
Hell- Helen?

13
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:07,840
Is that his wife's name?

14
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:09,280
Helen, it's me, Ray.

15
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:09,760
Helen.

16
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:12,480
It's spelled H-O-W-A-N.

17
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:12,880
Ray.

18
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:13,840
Hey, Helen.

19
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:14,240
Helen.

20
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:18,080
Ray Romano. I got kicked out of the house. I'm Ray.

21
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:21,360
This is My Brother, the Terminator. He causes a lot of-

22
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:23,440
I ate all the peanut butter, Ray.

23
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:26,800
Can I say my name is actually Griffin McElroy? Because I'm worried about my brand if I go a

24
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:30,640
week without saying my actual name on the air, then people will forget who I am. People might

25
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:33,680
think that I am actually Ray Romano, and that would be terrible for my brand.

26
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:36,560
How's married life treating you? How's it going?

27
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:42,560
You know, it's nice to eternally share my life with someone.

28
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:46,480
Well, it's been a fucking week. Why don't you hold back on that eternally shit?

29
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:49,920
Yeah, get to seven years, man. Then you're a little bit closer to eternity.

30
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:53,840
You know, in this day and age, not a lot of couples make it that one week stretch.

31
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:56,160
Mm-hmm. Yeah. What is it, like 50%?

32
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:57,520
Yeah.

33
00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:03,040
We goof. I think there was a Kardashian who actually didn't even cut it. I don't think they-

34
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:06,720
It was actually a Kardashian. I believe it was one of the female Kardashians.

35
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:13,360
It's the Kardashian-don was the dad of the family. They split up too. They were married

36
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:18,640
for a grip, though. They were married for like 35 years. Did you guys want some goss?

37
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:20,480
Yeah.

38
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:22,320
I know you come to me for all your-

39
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:23,360
Some Ryan Gosling?

40
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:23,600
No.

41
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:24,160
Some goss?

42
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:30,080
No, some hot sip. There's really no good way to abbreviate that word. But yeah,

43
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:37,680
they're a splitsville. I saw Chris. I don't know if that's the lady or the dude. I saw-

44
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:39,520
It's the lady. Bruce is the dude.

45
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:45,040
I saw Chris at the Country's Best Yogurt, and I saw Bruce across the street at a Cold Stone.

46
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:49,280
And it's like, I know that you guys are in the mood for a flavored treat,

47
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:53,680
and that's when I knew that things weren't going to last. It's because they wanted an icy-flavored

48
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:57,200
treat, and they couldn't get it together on whether they wanted the Country's Best Yogurt

49
00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:00,880
or Cold Stone Creamy. I get it, because Cold Stone Creamy, you have a lot more options,

50
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:04,720
but come on. It's called the Country's Best Yogurt.

51
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:08,480
Real quick, Griffin, are you saying Cold Stone Creamy?

52
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:09,440
Cold Stone Creamers.

53
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:17,200
Listen, if you want a taste treat, you go to Cold Stone Steve Austin. Everyone knows that.

54
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:20,160
Cold Stone Creamy was my favorite blaxploitation character.

55
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:23,120
He's so bad.

56
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:23,440
I'm just-

57
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:24,800
Cold Stone Creamy.

58
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:29,840
If we can't count on Chris and Kardashadon to fucking keep it-

59
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:35,120
Kardashadon's my favorite Pokemon. Are we gonna make it through a sentence without

60
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:37,120
talking about how good the new Pokemon game is?

61
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,960
I can't remember anything to add to that conversation. I saw a lot of

62
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:45,840
kids in line in cosplay as Kardashians.

63
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:47,920
No, they're-

64
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:51,600
That would be a baller move to roll it to Comic-Con dresses, your favorite Kardashian.

65
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:56,000
It was actually an amazing confluence, because we're having Super Se-Con,

66
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:00,000
which is the anime convention for Huntington, on the same weekend as the Pokemon launch.

67
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,680
Oh my god, I don't think I know that. I didn't think I knew that. Is it-

68
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:07,600
Huntington has an anime convention? Is it in the same building that they have the

69
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:09,280
hunting and fishing convention?

70
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:10,720
Yeah, the same one, of course.

71
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:13,680
Is it on the same day? Because that could be just a movie right there.

72
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:17,680
Awkward, no. We had the anime convention and the Pokemon launch in one night,

73
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:22,720
and you should have seen the downtown GameStop. It was like that rave scene from the Matrix,

74
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:25,520
except if everybody smelled like cabbage and had a sword.

75
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:29,440
There was a lot of swords.

76
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:34,400
And also, nobody probably went home and fucked after that. Or maybe everyone did.

77
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:35,440
Or maybe everyone did.

78
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:36,640
Maybe everyone did.

79
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:40,160
I think that if you're a dude in that situation, you're hanging out at the Huntington GameStop

80
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:43,760
downtown during the anime convention. You look around and go,

81
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:45,280
if not here, then when?

82
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:47,200
If not now, then why?

83
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:50,560
I want to get into the invite.

84
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:56,000
If not who, then the Incredible Hulk. That's right. I see you, Hulk hands. Come on.

85
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:01,680
Them shits opposable? Let's do this shit.

86
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:05,840
Wrap them meaty paws around my meat.

87
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:10,080
I'm gonna tear you out the rest of them clothes.

88
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:12,640
I can think of good things to eat for breakfast and dinner,

89
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:15,680
but when it comes to lunch, I always get stuck on sandwiches.

90
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:18,720
I'm too poor for those frozen meals that you just microwave.

91
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:22,080
Any good ideas for lunch? That's from bored of bread and meat.

92
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:25,440
So you want something better than a sandwich that's cheaper than a banquet meal?

93
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:26,800
Can't be done.

94
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:27,520
Trash?

95
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:28,720
Yeah, I guess just garbage.

96
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:31,920
Well, hold on, Travis. I don't think that meets the first criteria.

97
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:35,280
Oh, trash sandwich?

98
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:36,960
No? Well, that's still a sandwich.

99
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:41,520
Man, you know what? I think that...

100
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:44,240
Let me tell you about middle school Griffin.

101
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:46,480
Can I tell you both about middle school Griffin?

102
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:47,200
Please do.

103
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:48,240
Take me to the time tunnel.

104
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:50,160
Let's hop in the time vortex.

105
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:52,240
Whoa, I'm drowning.

106
00:05:53,920 --> 00:06:00,320
And middle school Griffin, when he started packing his lunch,

107
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:03,120
when mommy and daddy taught him how, he was psyched about the idea.

108
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:10,000
And he would wake up 45 minutes earlier than usual to bake his own artisanal sourdough

109
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:14,240
and cut off a little crostini that he would bake and season

110
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:17,920
and then sprinkle into his chef salad that he would take with him,

111
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:22,560
perfectly preserved in the freezer he had embedded into his locker.

112
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:29,600
About three weeks after that, my lunch routine was a can of Kmart brand Mountain Dew.

113
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:36,400
And sometimes a bag of chips and our mom would buy those sandwich bags that didn't zip.

114
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:38,720
So that was always fun to keep chips in.

115
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:44,080
I know the one near Taiwan where you had to do some sort of origami fold

116
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:46,480
to get your chips to stay put and then just hope.

117
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:51,440
It was more of a suggestion of a container.

118
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:53,600
Like, hey, chips, why don't you stay?

119
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:55,200
No, chips, why don't you stay right?

120
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:58,080
I wish we had been more vocal in our younger years

121
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:00,720
because we really should have demanded better.

122
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:03,840
I appreciate the need to cut corners, but that's a corner too far.

123
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:05,600
Except they didn't cut the corners off our sandwiches.

124
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:09,200
And also the third element, the third heat that I brought,

125
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:13,120
because you know how they say every meal has to have three parts of the pyramid in it,

126
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:14,720
was a little Debbie.

127
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:20,080
And it was typically that it had the crispy rice and it was puff shaped

128
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:21,840
and it had some caramel up in it.

129
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:22,480
Star Crunch.

130
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:23,280
Star Crunch.

131
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:27,760
So Star Crunch, a bag of chips and a Kmart brand Mountain Dew.

132
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:31,040
And some days I would just like not even, I would just open that bag

133
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:33,440
and I would get so depressed about my 12 year old lot in life

134
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:34,560
that I would just say, fuck it.

135
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:35,040
But I guess my point-

136
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:36,320
So you just skip the entree.

137
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:38,480
My point is just skip the meal.

138
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:40,640
I don't think human beings are meant for lunch.

139
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:44,320
I think just light snacking throughout the day is what you're supposed to do.

140
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:45,280
I'm into that, Griffin.

141
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:48,880
I think that if you, man, we don't need as much as we eat.

142
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:51,440
Now I don't always keep to this rule, but I've been trying to.

143
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:55,280
And I've been doing this thing where I fast two days a week.

144
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:56,240
So I eat like 600 calories.

145
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:56,720
Talk about this.

146
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:57,440
Talk about this on the show.

147
00:07:57,440 --> 00:08:00,880
Cause it sounds like fucking Nate Silver Witchcraft.

148
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:01,520
It doesn't sound like-

149
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:03,360
No, it's called the 5-2 diet.

150
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:04,800
Basically what you're doing is your game.

151
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:08,560
It's you eat normally most of the time.

152
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:11,840
And then two days a week, you have 600 calories.

153
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:13,120
If you're a dude, 500 calories.

154
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:14,080
If you're a lady.

155
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:16,160
For the whole motherfucking day.

156
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:17,360
Yeah.

157
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:19,280
That's like one glass of water.

158
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:20,640
Yeah, basically one glass of water.

159
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:21,600
Now here's the thing.

160
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:24,320
What it is basically what you got is body confusion.

161
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:26,800
Your body never knows when its next meal is coming.

162
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:28,560
So it's just constantly burning fat out of it.

163
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:29,680
I've heard of muscle confusion.

164
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:34,880
But you're talking about getting deep into the entire fucking ecosystem of your guts.

165
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:38,960
Now, Justin, have you ever woken up and found that your body was so confused that in your

166
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:41,600
sleep it was scrolling notes to you that just said like, need food.

167
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:43,200
I'm so hungry, please.

168
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:47,120
I've carved the word ham into my own forearm using my teeth.

169
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:55,600
No, but what I have learned is that, man, if you don't eat, that next meal tastes really good.

170
00:08:55,600 --> 00:09:03,040
There's no, I believe it was Rene Dickhart that said there's no greater sauce than hunger.

171
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:03,280
Yeah.

172
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:07,840
His veil of ham ignorance, I think, is the philosophical principle that was built upon.

173
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:11,760
If you skip lunch, what you're saying is I'm ready for a lifetime of delicious dinner.

174
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:16,080
So I've actually been thinking about this a lot when Rachel and I start churning out

175
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:20,720
lowlands, I'm not going to introduce them to ham.

176
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:23,200
Their entire life, I'm not going to introduce them to ham.

177
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:29,040
And then on my deathbed, on my deathbed, I will pull out a fucking cam's ham, honey,

178
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:31,120
roasted, not that pineapple shit.

179
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:33,120
I'm talking bare necessities.

180
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:33,920
I'm going to pull that.

181
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:37,120
I'm going to pull it out from under the bedcloth and say, I've seen this your whole life.

182
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:40,880
Do you imagine there will be a lot of problems with this plan?

183
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:44,240
Like when your kid's like, we're going to go spend Easter over a friend Sammy's house.

184
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:45,200
No, you can't.

185
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:46,320
You can't.

186
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:51,200
I've got this bitch I've been curing since I was 27 years old.

187
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:54,160
Look at the striations on this motherfucker.

188
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:56,880
This shit's going to fall apart in your mouth.

189
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:01,520
Thank you for this gift, daddy.

190
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:08,320
But forever, I don't understand pretty much anything you're saying right now.

191
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:12,880
But I do know that you're going to create an inextricable link between the flavor of

192
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:15,360
ham and the death of their dad.

193
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:19,120
So forever, every time the sweet taste of ham comes to their lips, they'll be like,

194
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:19,920
oh, this is pretty good.

195
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:21,040
This tastes like my dad dying.

196
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:25,920
What if they're like, you know, one of those people that just doesn't like the taste of ham

197
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:28,400
and you die and they take the bite and like, oh, this is like shit.

198
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:32,080
No, they're going to feel, they're going to feel guilted into liking the taste of ham.

199
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:35,840
If I've made it my life's goal to force feed them ham on my deathbed.

200
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:37,200
Yeah, I think they're going to like it.

201
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:39,760
And by the way, Justin, I'm going to live a full and happy life.

202
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:43,600
And when they eat ham, they're going to remember me finally with a smile.

203
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:45,440
They won't regret his death.

204
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:47,600
They will celebrate his life and also ham.

205
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:49,360
This tastes like the good times.

206
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:52,800
What's on this sandwich?

207
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:58,480
This tastes like the time that dad took me to the lake.

208
00:10:58,480 --> 00:10:59,200
We went fishing.

209
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:01,840
I remember him for what he was, not for what he wasn't.

210
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:03,600
I don't like ham.

211
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:06,320
Hey, I don't know how we got on ham.

212
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:07,360
I don't like ham.

213
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:08,080
I'm not into ham.

214
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:10,000
Well, that's because they got ham council.

215
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:12,240
Sorry, big ham.

216
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:14,640
Sorry.

217
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:15,600
Sorry, John Ham.

218
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:16,880
Don't mean to let you down.

219
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:17,680
Corporate ham.

220
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:20,080
I am sick of your propaganda bullshit.

221
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:23,520
I hate to keep putting our parents on blast, but I feel like most of the hands we ate as

222
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:25,120
kids had like pineapple on them.

223
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:30,080
And that's the, that's arguably sorry Hawaii, but that's the worst possible way to eat ham.

224
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:31,120
I disagree Griffin.

225
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:33,920
Cause I remember very distinctly getting many cams ham.

226
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:35,840
Thanks to dad's Christmas giveaway.

227
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:37,120
Mm hmm. Yeah.

228
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:39,360
Some people will take home a $5,000 bonus.

229
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:40,720
Take home this giant rump.

230
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:43,760
Cause it was all based on what popcorn tin you picked.

231
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:44,160
Mm hmm.

232
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:45,760
That was crazy.

233
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:46,560
The stupidest.

234
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:48,480
Anyway, I got a big screen TV that way.

235
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:48,800
Yeah.

236
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:48,960
Yeah.

237
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:51,040
And I got a ham like six years running.

238
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:53,520
So the girl I like is into rap.

239
00:11:53,520 --> 00:12:00,240
I don't like rap very much, but, and I'm not very into current music, but I told her I love rap.

240
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:01,120
What do I do?

241
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:03,040
Thanks if you answered this question.

242
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:04,720
I absolutely love your show show.

243
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:07,840
So rental floss sent me to you Gmail.

244
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:09,680
You're going to have to fake your own death.

245
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:11,040
Yeah.

246
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:13,120
I mean, that's a lot easier than hopefully.

247
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:14,160
Oh my God.

248
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:19,600
Fake your own death, but make it the result of a, a rap feud.

249
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:22,480
Maybe try to set up a situation.

250
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:23,440
Did you hear about Jimmy?

251
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:23,680
No.

252
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:23,920
What?

253
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:25,200
He got shot by Macklemore.

254
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:27,440
Macklemore brought Jimmy down.

255
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:32,960
Ian Macklemore had a lot worse rap tycoon that you could be brought down by

256
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:36,400
in, in today's today's age.

257
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:37,840
Will Smith shot by Will.

258
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:39,680
I am Will Smith shot me to death.

259
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:41,520
I didn't think he had it in him.

260
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:44,640
I said, I said after earth was just okay.

261
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:45,760
And he shot me to death.

262
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:48,960
I got killed by Ja Rule.

263
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:52,880
To be fair, you guys, if you're delivering the news in person, you're really bad at

264
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:53,760
faking your own death.

265
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:54,480
Yeah.

266
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:55,680
I got shot by Will Smith.

267
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:56,640
I'm dead now.

268
00:12:56,640 --> 00:12:59,680
You got to put white face powder and a sheet and some spooky.

269
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:01,600
Oh, sorry guys.

270
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:01,840
Sorry.

271
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:03,120
My bad.

272
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:04,080
Avenge me.

273
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:09,120
Why did you get yourself into this old dickament in the first place?

274
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:14,640
Hey everybody, learn from this dude's mistake and then we'll fail to help him.

275
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:16,400
But first learn from his mistake.

276
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:21,440
And if the girl says, or a dude says, or anyone says, hey, yeah, I'm really into rap.

277
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:24,160
Go, oh, you know, I, I'm not a huge fan.

278
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:25,520
I prefer such and such.

279
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:29,040
No, you got to drill down into, okay.

280
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:30,000
That ship has sailed.

281
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:30,400
Yeah.

282
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:35,120
What you need to do is you need to drill down it into a specific area of rap music.

283
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:36,720
I would go classic.

284
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:38,160
Yeah, that's good.

285
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:38,880
It's digestible.

286
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:42,720
Also, it's way, way better than anything except for Kanye West, my beautiful dark

287
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:46,080
twisted fantasy, which is damn, that's a good one.

288
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:48,240
What's that Frank Ocean one from, from last year?

289
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:49,440
Damn, that's a good one too.

290
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:52,640
I think also check out tech nine, Kansas city's premier rapper.

291
00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:53,920
Well, that was like a decade ago.

292
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:56,160
I don't think he's their premier rapper anymore.

293
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:59,200
There's actually some dope shit actually going on right now in the rap scene.

294
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:03,440
Del, Deltron has dropped his new fucking doom tree.

295
00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:05,040
Okay.

296
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:07,040
Fucking Macklemore.

297
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:07,760
So here's the thing.

298
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:12,240
This is cause I like, I like the rap music.

299
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:13,280
No, you don't.

300
00:14:13,280 --> 00:14:17,040
I mean, you do, you do in the same level that we all do, but I wouldn't say that you're

301
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:18,080
an aficionado.

302
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:19,680
Oh God, no, not at all.

303
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:22,000
I would not argue that at all, but I'm, I'm a fan.

304
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:22,720
I enjoy it.

305
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:26,800
My statement is I feel like it's probably the same as like,

306
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:32,160
if you try to talk to someone who's like super into indie music and you're like, yeah,

307
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:34,480
I listened to the December's like they're going to laugh in your face.

308
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:40,000
It's like Justin, that's the Justin McElroy dilemma or Justin, when he makes fun of hipsters,

309
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:43,920
he talks about arcade fire and it's like, they want to fucking, they want a Grammy.

310
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:45,680
Like that's that ain't deep.

311
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:49,600
So I feel like you couldn't say like, yeah, I'm really into rap music.

312
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:51,200
I love Jay Z and Kanye West.

313
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:54,080
I'd love to win that old lady rapped on America's Got Talent.

314
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:54,400
Yeah.

315
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:54,880
Right.

316
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:56,160
Yeah. Right.

317
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:58,800
Who should, who should this person get into though?

318
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:00,320
I feel like he's got to drill down.

319
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:03,200
And I say it's the same thing with, with hipsters.

320
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:04,080
You make up a name.

321
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:06,560
Oh, yeah.

322
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:09,360
And then say like, well, it's just this little, it's this little known dude.

323
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:10,960
He operates out of San Francisco.

324
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:12,000
You probably haven't heard of him.

325
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,600
You know, Stone Cold Creamy, right?

326
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:14,240
Yeah.

327
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:17,520
Oh, if you liked two chains, you'll love three chains.

328
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:24,880
You can pretend that your parents only bought you off-brand rap CDs growing up.

329
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:25,760
They only bought generic.

330
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:27,280
I prefer Run DMD.

331
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:31,280
Have you heard Run D&D?

332
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:35,680
Have you heard it's this Will Smith's seminal album, Big Billy style?

333
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:39,120
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

334
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:41,440
You guys into, you guys into Naughty by Nurture?

335
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:46,320
You know, there's actually a big debate in the psychology community about

336
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:48,160
Naughty by Nurture versus Naughty by Nature.

337
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:52,560
Do you guys, do you guys like KVP?

338
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:56,160
It was, it was, it was TLC's side project.

339
00:15:58,640 --> 00:16:00,000
You got to go classic.

340
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,240
Learn like five of the most seminal rap albums.

341
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:02,800
But that's the thing.

342
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:03,520
He fucked himself.

343
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:04,800
He said, oh yeah, I like rap.

344
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:11,600
That doesn't mean I, I can do the entirety of, you know, some LL Cool J song.

345
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:12,080
It means.

346
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:14,960
But the, but the options are, he has three options.

347
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:16,480
One, he backpedals and tells the truth.

348
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:17,600
Well, that's out.

349
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:21,360
Number two, he learns all, he becomes familiar with all of rap music.

350
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:22,320
That's out.

351
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:28,240
He, the only option really is that he, he refined his prior statement.

352
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:30,960
That, oh, I like rap, but I should have clarified.

353
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:33,520
I only like rap made before 1989.

354
00:16:33,520 --> 00:16:34,080
Okay.

355
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:38,400
So you learn, you learn all of Rapper's Delight and you say, I love Sugar Hill Gang.

356
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:40,240
And then you're in the car with her two years down the road.

357
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:41,920
You're fucking married and Apache comes on.

358
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:42,800
She's like, here it comes.

359
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:45,840
And you're like, hey, Steve, do the thing.

360
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:46,320
Hey, hey.

361
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:48,480
She's like, do the trademark dance.

362
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:51,120
And you start like doing the fucking Super Bowl shuffle.

363
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:52,640
And she's like, that's not right.

364
00:16:52,640 --> 00:16:53,600
Who did I marry?

365
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:56,320
Do you guys want to Yahoo?

366
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:57,440
Yeah, please.

367
00:16:59,280 --> 00:17:01,280
This Yahoo was sent in by Paul.

368
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:02,240
Thanks, Paul.

369
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:11,840
It's by Yahoo answers user question mark, a ghost user who asks why does my dad think

370
00:17:11,840 --> 00:17:12,800
I need a bedtime?

371
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:18,560
So I'm 13 and my dad still makes me go to bed at 10 30 on the weekends.

372
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:24,320
If you think this is unnormal, that, that I guess everyone is because all my friends

373
00:17:24,320 --> 00:17:25,440
don't have a bedtime.

374
00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:27,600
And Dawn say, oh, your dad is right.

375
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:30,000
You're only 13 because you know, that's bullshit.

376
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:32,960
I'm sorry.

377
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:37,760
Is it dogs say and Dawn say, oh, your dad is right.

378
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:40,720
You're only 13 because you know, that's some bullshit.

379
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:42,880
Don't feed question mark a fucking line.

380
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:47,040
Oh, don't say, don't say, don't speak.

381
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:47,280
Yeah.

382
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:51,360
For some reason, I thought he was calling people dogs, but that said, well, you know,

383
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:52,080
why?

384
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:54,080
Hey, you don't, that's bullshit.

385
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:56,800
When did you cast off the shackles of your bedtime?

386
00:17:56,800 --> 00:17:59,280
Because I really think I had one through high school.

387
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:04,400
I really, I think I remember mom and dad realizing that I was staying up so I could

388
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:05,440
watch a vault Disney.

389
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:09,280
So I could watch black and white Zorro and they went, we've lost that one.

390
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:09,840
Yeah.

391
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:10,960
Just let him stay up.

392
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:11,280
Yeah.

393
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:15,040
It's not like if he doesn't come home till 11 one night, he's getting some pussy

394
00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:15,520
somewhere.

395
00:18:16,560 --> 00:18:19,760
Yeah, he's, he just wants to watch fault Disney.

396
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:23,440
He wants to watch the making of tomorrow land documentary.

397
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:24,080
Just let him go.

398
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:26,480
The making of the making of tomorrow land.

399
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:31,200
That's what you were, it was about the building of it, but it was narrated by Walt Disney

400
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:32,320
and it was fascinating.

401
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:33,280
I would crush that.

402
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:34,480
I would watch that so hard.

403
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:38,880
The, uh, I, do you know how I'm 32 years old?

404
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:42,080
Do you know how much I would love it if I had an adult, my life that would tell me to

405
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:42,960
go to sleep?

406
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:44,720
That's the whole reason I got married.

407
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:47,280
So that Teresa will look over me and go, Hey, it's bedtime.

408
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:48,320
Thank you, Jesus.

409
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:49,120
Thank you so much.

410
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:50,160
Oh, what a relief.

411
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:52,560
I think I was just keeping my eyes open till you said something.

412
00:18:52,560 --> 00:19:03,680
I think we all have an adult inside of us that, uh, Oh no, I think we all have an adult

413
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:09,600
inside of me that at 10 30 he goes, Hey, both lights out.

414
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:14,000
Um, and I think it's just, I think it's, I guess maybe my heart out of my heart at around

415
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:17,280
10 30 is like a chug, a lug, chug lug.

416
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:19,280
It's time to go to bed.

417
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:19,680
Mr.

418
00:19:19,680 --> 00:19:22,720
Man, no vault Disney for you tonight.

419
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:27,600
You can Tivo that episode of Zorro you've been meaning to catch.

420
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:29,520
I actually have two internal parents.

421
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:33,680
I have one that comes by at 11 and says, Hey, it's time for bed.

422
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:38,880
But if I pitch a fit and I stay up later, I have a much more stern parent that shows

423
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:40,640
up at two on the weekends.

424
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:43,680
It says, Hey, Hey, Mr.

425
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:44,960
Man, Mr.

426
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:45,360
Mr.

427
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:47,680
Thinks he's such a hot shot because he's 32 years old.

428
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:49,600
You will get in the bed right this second.

429
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:50,080
Don't try.

430
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:51,680
I've got, I've got two parents as well.

431
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:56,000
One that says, go to bed at 10 30 and one that the next morning when I decide to stay

432
00:19:56,000 --> 00:20:00,240
out till two, the next morning just sits there with his arms crossed going, so we thought

433
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:02,160
we'd stay up till two, did we?

434
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:02,960
And here it is.

435
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:04,400
Seven 30 awake as always.

436
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:05,920
See my second, how do we feel?

437
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:11,120
My second parent, if I make it to like 11 15 PM and my, my brain isn't completely in a

438
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:16,400
state of total shutdown, then my parent at seven AM beats the shit out of me with an

439
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:17,280
extension cord.

440
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:22,320
Travis was pretty no.

441
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:27,920
I think Travis was more than I ever remember when Travis was like in high school, that

442
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:29,520
fool would sleep late.

443
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:33,520
Yeah, you would sleep like 11 or 12 or one or two.

444
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:35,920
You would just keep on going with it in college.

445
00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:39,680
I used to schedule my classes to only be like afternoon classes, and then I just sleep to

446
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:41,040
like two o'clock in the afternoon.

447
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:45,200
And like that, the very concept of that baffles me.

448
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:47,600
Now every day, every goddamn day.

449
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:49,680
Now I am up at seven 30 AM.

450
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:54,560
Yeah, I would, I would go to two to like two was my usual bedtime in college.

451
00:20:54,560 --> 00:20:56,000
That's insane.

452
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,480
That's like a different human that was in my body.

453
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:00,480
I look at that now and go, what were you doing?

454
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:08,320
Why do we have so many people just coming in and out of us through our revolving doors?

455
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:10,480
That's what life is like.

456
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:13,680
Life is like you're, it's like being James Bond.

457
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:16,320
You have different actors playing you throughout your history.

458
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:18,400
The seven stages of man, Griffin.

459
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:22,000
In the morning, he has four legs.

460
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,360
Wait, how long?

461
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:29,120
Yeah, and then then he's got three because one of them's waving.

462
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:34,400
My wife and I both love dressing up for Halloween, but we have one problem this year.

463
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:38,800
None of our friends are throwing a party and our apartment is too small to host one.

464
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:41,120
We have no kids to dress up with or take trick or treating.

465
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:45,200
How can we celebrate without being two costume loners in our living room?

466
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:47,920
Mainlining Downton Abbey.

467
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:49,840
That's from Not So Scary in Salt Lake City.

468
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:51,440
You don't need kids to go trick or treating.

469
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:54,080
You don't need trick or treating to have fun.

470
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:57,440
You need, you specifically need to just chill and watch Downton Abbey.

471
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:00,480
You've been given a pass.

472
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:02,400
Here's what I'm, here's what I'm going to hit you with.

473
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:08,320
The Halloween block party in Salt Lake City.

474
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:12,720
Okay, 6 p.m. to 1 30 a.m.

475
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:14,720
Got a costume contest.

476
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:16,160
I'm reading their Facebook page right now.

477
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:17,840
Got a costume contest.

478
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:20,160
Got a DJ.

479
00:22:21,680 --> 00:22:25,760
I, okay, I have just noticed that it was in 2009, but wait.

480
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:27,040
Hold on, hold the phone.

481
00:22:27,040 --> 00:22:28,400
Wait, hold the phone.

482
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:30,000
Wait, it's still going.

483
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,120
It's still going.

484
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:31,760
It's amazing.

485
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:33,680
The Dowager Countess is going to be there.

486
00:22:33,680 --> 00:22:38,000
There's that really cuddly looking Labrador.

487
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:41,280
There's a, oh no, wait, that's the, that's Downton Abbey.

488
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:42,320
You should do that thing.

489
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:43,360
Cause it sounds way better.

490
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:45,600
Jonathan Rees-Davies is going to be there.

491
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:49,040
And also that kid who played short round and, oh no, sorry.

492
00:22:49,040 --> 00:22:49,920
That's the Comic Con.

493
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:51,840
Oh my God.

494
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:54,320
October 26th, 7 30 p.m.

495
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:56,960
Head on down to the Maverick Center and you're going to catch the

496
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:59,760
Macklemore and Ryan Lewis Halloween 2013.

497
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:01,040
Yes.

498
00:23:01,040 --> 00:23:02,320
There's your event.

499
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:03,840
Go dressed up as Macklemore.

500
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:07,920
Did you know that during Macklemore and Ryan Lewis's Halloween shows,

501
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:10,720
they change all their lyrics to be spookier?

502
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:11,360
This is true.

503
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:13,920
That this is the moment.

504
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:18,080
They actually, at the end, they say, and vampires can't hold us.

505
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:19,040
This is the night.

506
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:20,800
It's super spooky.

507
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:23,760
When I was nine, I thought that I was a skeleton.

508
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:28,880
Can we have money?

509
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:40,880
Yeah, I can get you some money.

510
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:44,960
I had a terrible thing happen to me this week where I recorded

511
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:47,440
Saturday Night Live.

512
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:52,480
But because of a sporting event, it didn't start till a half hour later.

513
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:54,160
My DVR didn't know that.

514
00:23:54,160 --> 00:23:58,160
So I got half hour of sport and then only the first hour of SNL.

515
00:23:58,160 --> 00:24:00,640
And they put the really bizarre stuff at the end always,

516
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:02,880
or the stuff that they know isn't going to work, but they have to fill time.

517
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:03,520
Sometimes it does.

518
00:24:05,040 --> 00:24:06,160
I love that stuff.

519
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:08,720
So I guess I didn't panic, though.

520
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:09,120
You know why?

521
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:10,480
Because I got Hulu Plus.

522
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:14,720
With Hulu Plus, you can stream everything in HD for a great viewing experience.

523
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:16,960
TV on the go, on your smartphone or tablet.

524
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:20,960
And you can watch shows when you miss them, which I do.

525
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:22,560
That's the whole reason I have a subscription.

526
00:24:22,560 --> 00:24:24,400
So I can, A, mainline a bunch of shows.

527
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:27,520
Like I've been mainlining America's Not Top Model.

528
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:29,600
Oh, Jesus, 2.0.

529
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:30,640
It is still popping off.

530
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:31,200
I can't.

531
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:35,200
Every week, the guy I think is going to go home doesn't go home.

532
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:36,640
He's clutching it.

533
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:37,440
He's clutching it.

534
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:38,400
He's not letting go.

535
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:40,960
You can check out exclusive content, including Hulu Originals,

536
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:42,880
like The Awesomes, starring SNL's Seth Meyers,

537
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:45,520
and Moon Boy, starring Chris O'Dowd for Bridesmaids.

538
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:47,600
I got movies if you want that.

539
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:49,360
And it's only eight bucks a month.

540
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:49,920
Stream as much as you want.

541
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:52,800
That's the thing is like, I've got a fucking busy schedule,

542
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:55,920
but for eight bucks a month, that's worth like a solid weekend

543
00:24:55,920 --> 00:24:58,400
to veg out of just like nothing but Hulu Plus.

544
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:01,760
Eight dollars, that's like half a movie ticket.

545
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:03,760
Great news is we got a special deal for you.

546
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:05,600
HuluPlus.com forward slash my brother.

547
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:09,840
Get on over there, and you're going to get an extended free trial.

548
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:10,640
How can you beat that?

549
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:11,040
You can't.

550
00:25:11,040 --> 00:25:11,680
The answer?

551
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:12,400
You can't.

552
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:13,120
I can tell you how to beat-

553
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:13,920
So stop trying.

554
00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:16,480
I can tell you how to beat this, though, and I'm pointing my dick.

555
00:25:17,680 --> 00:25:19,360
Well, Griffin, you're going to beat your dick,

556
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:20,560
but you can't do that.

557
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:22,320
You don't have anything in your home to beat your dick with.

558
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:26,800
I have hundreds of things, but continue.

559
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:28,560
I have so, so many.

560
00:25:28,560 --> 00:25:31,920
I could, there's, I have like four avocados in the kitchen.

561
00:25:31,920 --> 00:25:34,080
What the fuck are you talking about?

562
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:35,360
If you're going to beat your dick-

563
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:37,280
Did you hear about Griffin's cockamole?

564
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:39,760
It's delicious.

565
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:40,640
I'm dead.

566
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:47,440
If you're going to beat your dick, turn to the professionals at ExtremeRestraints.com.

567
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:50,240
They have everything you need to fuck so good.

568
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:52,640
If you want a flicker whip,

569
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:56,480
you want to put pictures of your whip up for everybody to look at,

570
00:25:57,280 --> 00:25:58,320
put them on Flickr.

571
00:25:58,320 --> 00:26:00,080
But if you want a flicker whip,

572
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:03,440
that's a braided whip that will make them stand at attention.

573
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:06,880
27.5 inches braided nylon tassel at the tip,

574
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:08,560
handle covered in rubber,

575
00:26:08,560 --> 00:26:11,440
and you're going to feel a powerful sting with the impact of this whip.

576
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:12,800
Do they have Tumblr lube?

577
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:16,320
No.

578
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:21,520
No, they do have, they do have Clitter Twitter, which is not-

579
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:22,560
Interesting.

580
00:26:22,560 --> 00:26:27,120
Do they have LiveJournal, but, but, hold on.

581
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:31,520
Do they have LiveJournal sex?

582
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:36,720
Seven inches long, put it in your urethra.

583
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:37,760
It will shock you.

584
00:26:38,560 --> 00:26:41,600
This is not a torture, this is sexual pleasure.

585
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:45,760
And it's the electrical urethral sound for just $59.99.

586
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:47,280
I have a pretty deep urethra.

587
00:26:47,280 --> 00:26:50,800
I have a urethra that goes, like, really far in there.

588
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:52,640
So seven inches sounds just about right.

589
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:55,600
If any of this sounds good to you, and I'm sure it does,

590
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:58,640
go to ExtremeShanks.com, use the coupon code Sexabunga,

591
00:26:58,640 --> 00:26:59,840
and you're going to save 20%.

592
00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:00,960
I mean, here's the beauty.

593
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:02,880
Even if none of that sounds good to you,

594
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:04,160
they have such a selection.

595
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:05,280
You're going to find something.

596
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:07,040
God, they're just the best.

597
00:27:07,040 --> 00:27:08,240
I've missed them so much.

598
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:09,360
I got a message for Pete.

599
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:10,800
It's from Colin and Nate.

600
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:13,760
And Colin and Nate say,

601
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:16,080
happy birthday from your two brothers on your favorite show

602
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:16,880
about brothers.

603
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:19,840
Thanks for introducing us to all the Maximum Fun podcast

604
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:21,280
and getting us addicted to that sweet,

605
00:27:21,280 --> 00:27:22,880
sweet drug of chuckles.

606
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:24,160
We hope you have a great birthday,

607
00:27:24,160 --> 00:27:25,520
but no matter what the McElroys tell you,

608
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:27,120
don't kiss your dad's square on the lips.

609
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:28,400
That would be weird.

610
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:29,920
Travis kissed our dad's square on the lips.

611
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:33,280
Daddy kissed me on the lips during our wedding.

612
00:27:33,280 --> 00:27:34,080
During my wedding.

613
00:27:35,680 --> 00:27:37,840
We say that every week, but that's not something we do.

614
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:38,880
And then dad was like, what's up?

615
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:39,520
He did it.

616
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:40,320
I tried to stop.

617
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:40,960
Special moment.

618
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:42,080
Travis tried to turn away.

619
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:43,920
It looks like he got half mouth.

620
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:46,400
I swear to God, he just got mustache.

621
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:50,160
I was, I mean, I was riding shotgun on that love train.

622
00:27:50,160 --> 00:27:51,840
He grazed mustache.

623
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:53,440
There was no lip to lip contact.

624
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:55,200
You literally were pushing him off of you.

625
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:56,480
Yeah.

626
00:27:56,480 --> 00:27:57,920
Travis, who's the other message for?

627
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:00,560
The other message is for Steven Ellison.

628
00:28:02,160 --> 00:28:03,040
Do you want me to keep going?

629
00:28:03,040 --> 00:28:03,280
Yeah.

630
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:05,520
Okay, it's from Ash.

631
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:08,000
It was at the beginning of a fucking great conversation

632
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:08,800
between the two of us.

633
00:28:08,800 --> 00:28:09,280
I felt this was an interview.

634
00:28:09,280 --> 00:28:12,000
Just two brothers rapping about who the messages are from.

635
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:13,760
The message is from Ash Stokes.

636
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:17,520
And Ash says, Steven celebrates his 23rd name day on October 8th.

637
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:19,680
You're no friend of mine, but congratulations

638
00:28:19,680 --> 00:28:21,760
on becoming a man grown all the same.

639
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:23,920
Now, if only you weren't dumber than 10 butts.

640
00:28:23,920 --> 00:28:24,800
Come on now.

641
00:28:24,800 --> 00:28:25,520
Don't use our show for negativity.

642
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:27,840
It's nice we can bring the friends together.

643
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:28,560
Yeah.

644
00:28:28,560 --> 00:28:30,880
I mean, I've noticed a trend.

645
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:32,800
I think it's just sort of the nature.

646
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:36,320
It's sort of the fact that every thing in the world

647
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:37,760
is getting coated in mood slime.

648
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:41,040
But I think that our messages have gotten pretty nasty lately.

649
00:28:41,040 --> 00:28:42,640
I'd like to see some positivity.

650
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:46,720
Next week, I would like, well, no, not next week

651
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:47,600
because I'll be in Scotland.

652
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:51,040
But I would like to see some various messages

653
00:28:51,040 --> 00:28:53,600
that were just like, hey, it's not your birthday.

654
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:55,440
It's not an anniversary.

655
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:56,480
I just want to say I love you.

656
00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:57,440
Do you remember that one that was like,

657
00:28:57,440 --> 00:28:58,400
happy birthday, Steve.

658
00:28:58,400 --> 00:29:00,400
Also, fuck you, you fucking asshole.

659
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:02,640
Like, can we not give Steve a break?

660
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:06,640
On this day of all days, on Steve day?

661
00:29:07,680 --> 00:29:09,600
To be fair, you did miss Steve day

662
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:11,760
by like five or six days.

663
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:12,160
Yeah.

664
00:29:12,160 --> 00:29:14,080
So now who's the fucking asshole?

665
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:15,280
See, this is getting heated now.

666
00:29:15,280 --> 00:29:17,520
Now we're getting the mood slime on us by contact.

667
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:20,880
I'm already fucking, I'm the choke off of mood slime already.

668
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:22,960
I'm fucking coated in that shit.

669
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:24,880
Everything's so shitty, guys.

670
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:27,040
I actually like the mood slime.

671
00:29:27,040 --> 00:29:28,240
It cleans my pores.

672
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:29,360
Do we have farm wisdom?

673
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:30,640
We don't even have farm wisdom.

674
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:31,920
Fuck.

675
00:29:31,920 --> 00:29:34,240
Well, that's because farm wisdom is a government program.

676
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:35,920
I can't fucking believe.

677
00:29:36,800 --> 00:29:38,800
Farm subsidy wisdom.

678
00:29:38,800 --> 00:29:40,000
Farm subsidy wisdom.

679
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,000
I hate to hold the baby over the cliff.

680
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:47,520
I hate to put the tiger on the table and yell at it.

681
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:51,600
But if the government shutdown isn't fixed by next week,

682
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:52,480
we're going to cancel the show.

683
00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:54,880
That's what it's going to take.

684
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:55,600
We got to.

685
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:56,160
And you know what?

686
00:29:56,160 --> 00:29:58,320
Even if they do fix it, I'm canceling the show anyway.

687
00:29:58,320 --> 00:30:00,240
Just to show them what they've done.

688
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:02,240
Write your senators and congressmen right now and say,

689
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:03,200
I want to see a letter.

690
00:30:03,920 --> 00:30:08,000
I want someone to send me a letter that they get from their senator or congressman

691
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,400
that references the fact that they're sorry

692
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:12,160
that they didn't get their my brother and my brother and me.

693
00:30:12,160 --> 00:30:14,880
Tell them we're a government program and we got shut down.

694
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:19,680
Can we organize a million mom march?

695
00:30:21,280 --> 00:30:21,840
How hard is that?

696
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:23,760
How hard is one of those to throw together?

697
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:25,600
How many moms do we know?

698
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:26,880
I know like eight.

699
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:27,600
How many you guys know?

700
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:30,240
I could probably put in like six.

701
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:30,720
Okay.

702
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:31,600
Nobody 14.

703
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:32,400
Nobody has babies.

704
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:39,120
I know a lot of homebrewers.

705
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:40,160
How about puppy moms?

706
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:44,080
If you're a mom, send a letter to your congressman.

707
00:30:44,080 --> 00:30:48,000
I think that our cause is the kind of cause that we could really get all those moms fired up about.

708
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:50,160
Because we all have cause of we have.

709
00:30:50,160 --> 00:30:51,120
What's our cause again?

710
00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:52,000
Do we have a cause?

711
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:53,040
I'm just angry.

712
00:30:53,040 --> 00:30:54,960
The government shutdown is not funny anymore.

713
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:56,880
And it's the only intro we have.

714
00:30:56,880 --> 00:30:58,080
It's the only thing that's going on.

715
00:30:58,080 --> 00:30:59,920
It's the only thing anyone's talking about.

716
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:03,200
We're definitely going over that fucking fiscal cliff too.

717
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:06,640
Don't even worry about it anymore, guys.

718
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:07,520
It's four days away.

719
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:08,720
Don't even worry about it.

720
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:10,400
Just like get excited about it.

721
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:15,680
Just like it's like you're on the King's Island ride and you're going up the hill.

722
00:31:15,680 --> 00:31:20,880
And like just know that it's going to go down the hill and it's going to be like a fun apocalypse thing.

723
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:23,280
Just stay behind Warren Buffett and you'll be safe.

724
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:24,560
Yeah.

725
00:31:24,560 --> 00:31:25,600
Go buy some seeds.

726
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:26,720
My name is Graham Clark.

727
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:27,920
My name is Dave Shumka.

728
00:31:27,920 --> 00:31:31,120
I'm the other guy who hosts Stop Podcasting Yourself.

729
00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:34,080
And I'm the other guy that hosts Stop Podcasting Yourself.

730
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:37,520
We are from Canada, so we don't know many of your ways.

731
00:31:37,520 --> 00:31:40,400
But what we do know is quality podcasting.

732
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:41,360
And whale blubber.

733
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:41,840
Yeah.

734
00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:44,880
There's 50 different words for podcast in our language.

735
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:46,240
We would say all 50 of them.

736
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:50,800
But why don't you just listen to our show and you'll get the gist of what we're about.

737
00:31:50,800 --> 00:31:54,240
We bring a guest on, we talk about their lives, we talk about our lives,

738
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:57,040
we talk about our lives, we talk about things they've overheard.

739
00:31:57,040 --> 00:31:58,160
It's a great time.

740
00:31:58,160 --> 00:31:58,800
And you know what?

741
00:31:58,800 --> 00:32:00,000
You're not going to regret it.

742
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,360
Stop Podcasting Yourself.

743
00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:04,800
Available from Maximumfun.org or on iTunes.

744
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:05,600
Brr.

745
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:07,600
That's what we say in Canada when we're cold.

746
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:11,840
At the start of the year, I went on a handful of dates with a girl.

747
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:16,160
We only went on two and then we stopped, which I wasn't hugely upset by.

748
00:32:16,160 --> 00:32:18,400
We're still friends and we see each other occasionally.

749
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:20,480
She's now dating my best friend who I live with.

750
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:22,640
They're at our house all the time.

751
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:25,520
They both seem to think it's a lot more awkward than it actually is.

752
00:32:25,520 --> 00:32:28,640
When I'm around, they both hide away or sit at opposite sides of the room.

753
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:31,840
They stop talking to each other and they both look really embarrassed.

754
00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:34,560
I don't really care if they're dating, but it seems the two of them think that I care.

755
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:38,640
I've told them I don't really care, but apparently they seem to think I'm lying or something.

756
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:40,480
I can't exactly pack my bags and move away.

757
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:41,200
So what should I do?

758
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:42,560
That's from Big Tom Awkward Embarrassment.

759
00:32:42,560 --> 00:32:44,160
Way to tie our fucking arms.

760
00:32:45,040 --> 00:32:45,280
Wow.

761
00:32:45,280 --> 00:32:48,080
I had that one cocked and ready and loaded from like sentence two.

762
00:32:49,360 --> 00:32:50,720
You do need to move out though.

763
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:53,120
Yeah, you got to get out of there.

764
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:53,520
Yeah.

765
00:32:53,520 --> 00:32:55,440
You don't have to move away.

766
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:57,280
You do have to move over there though.

767
00:32:58,400 --> 00:32:59,440
Over in that direction.

768
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:00,400
Maybe two blocks down.

769
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:05,760
Maybe, kind of like a more natural solution.

770
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:07,520
Something that I think might make them more comfortable.

771
00:33:07,520 --> 00:33:08,000
Winter back.

772
00:33:08,560 --> 00:33:09,120
Sorry, go ahead.

773
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:09,600
What?

774
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:10,160
Winter back.

775
00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:11,600
Sorry, winter back.

776
00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:16,080
No, when you're in the room with them, maybe instead of just telling them that you're okay

777
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:23,520
with it, maybe start encouraging them, maybe even directing them in some displays of increasingly

778
00:33:23,520 --> 00:33:24,480
intimate affection.

779
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:24,720
Okay.

780
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:27,360
So you're sitting there on the couch.

781
00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:28,000
They're sitting there on the sofa.

782
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:28,720
Start slow.

783
00:33:29,520 --> 00:33:30,080
Start slow.

784
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:34,320
Just, hey, Daryl, put your hand on her hand, Daryl.

785
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:36,720
Isn't her hand soft, Daryl?

786
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:39,120
Stephanie, explore his body.

787
00:33:40,160 --> 00:33:40,960
That's good.

788
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:41,840
That's good.

789
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:42,400
That's very good.

790
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:43,200
Nuzzle her.

791
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:46,240
Now do that one thing we did together that one time.

792
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:48,320
You remember that thing I did to you so right?

793
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:51,040
Do that to her, Daryl.

794
00:33:51,040 --> 00:33:52,160
Oh, what's that?

795
00:33:52,160 --> 00:33:52,960
You don't remember?

796
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:54,400
I took you to Shoney's.

797
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:56,400
Take her to Shoney's, Daryl.

798
00:33:56,400 --> 00:33:57,520
Take her to Shoney's, Daryl.

799
00:33:57,520 --> 00:34:00,560
You said it was the most erotic thing anyone had ever done for you.

800
00:34:00,560 --> 00:34:02,320
They got you all those free suckers.

801
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:06,560
I want you to be like Arnold Schwarzenegger in True Lies directing Jamie Lee Curtis as

802
00:34:06,560 --> 00:34:07,120
she strips.

803
00:34:07,120 --> 00:34:08,960
I want that level of uncomfortable.

804
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:10,640
Only it's a duo team.

805
00:34:10,640 --> 00:34:11,120
Yeah.

806
00:34:11,120 --> 00:34:13,520
This is going to be super erotic.

807
00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:18,320
I want to see you two get to the concession stand, which is not really first, second,

808
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:19,760
third, or fourth base.

809
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:24,080
It's a little bit before, but really, I mean, all of this is foreplay.

810
00:34:25,600 --> 00:34:27,280
Buy her a lick of mate, Daryl.

811
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:28,160
Buy her a lick of mate.

812
00:34:29,120 --> 00:34:31,760
Daryl, you know those gumballs that look like tiny baseballs?

813
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:32,320
She loves those.

814
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:33,040
She loves those.

815
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:34,960
And then start crying.

816
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:36,480
And then start crying so hard.

817
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:37,520
I miss you.

818
00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:38,400
I miss you, Steph.

819
00:34:38,400 --> 00:34:42,240
Remember, I used to buy you ice cream helmets.

820
00:34:42,240 --> 00:34:44,080
I miss you so damn much.

821
00:34:44,080 --> 00:34:46,640
I miss you so damn much, Stephanie.

822
00:34:46,640 --> 00:34:49,760
Do you guys think it's acceptable for adults to eat lick of maids?

823
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:50,800
This isn't a question.

824
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:52,880
I know I said it like a question that we have.

825
00:34:52,880 --> 00:34:54,480
I'm asking you right now.

826
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:56,320
I love lick of maids.

827
00:34:56,320 --> 00:34:57,360
But I cannot think.

828
00:34:57,360 --> 00:34:59,920
I'm just thinking it would look like, I don't know.

829
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:03,920
I feel like it would look like an ogre eating a child's playset or something.

830
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:05,840
I feel like I can't eat lick of maids.

831
00:35:05,840 --> 00:35:10,800
I feel like if another adult saw you doing it, they'd think, oh, that's horrendous.

832
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:13,200
That man has stolen some child's candy.

833
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:16,880
I feel like I'd look like a fraggle eating a building the doozers built.

834
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:18,080
Like, just a very sort of.

835
00:35:18,080 --> 00:35:21,920
I think the better simile is you would look like an ogre eating a lick of maids.

836
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:23,280
Because you're dipping.

837
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:28,080
That's the kind of shit that's OK to eat when you're a kid.

838
00:35:28,080 --> 00:35:32,480
It's like, oh, you'd need a vehicle for this straight sugar powder?

839
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:33,280
How about a sugar stick?

840
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:36,400
I would be less upset seeing you just mainlining coke.

841
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:39,200
Yeah, or no, probably not that.

842
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:47,440
You got to be careful, though, because there's a lot of very cheap but fake lick of maids

843
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:48,160
circulating.

844
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:54,480
It's that lick of maid crocodile you think you're going to get a flavor treat.

845
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:58,320
Hey, everyone, can you stop posting pictures of crocodile on social media?

846
00:35:58,320 --> 00:36:00,240
I think I'm overseeing those.

847
00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:02,000
I don't think I need to see any more.

848
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:03,600
I'm not going to be afraid anymore.

849
00:36:03,600 --> 00:36:09,040
I don't think the fear of crocodile has any actual purpose in my life.

850
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:13,120
It's not like I was on the street like I need some thrifty heroin on the cheap cheap.

851
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:16,240
Can I throw something out to our question, Oscar?

852
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:16,740
Yeah.

853
00:36:17,680 --> 00:36:18,720
What about this?

854
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:25,600
It sounds to me like they kind of want you to be a little bit upset about it.

855
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:26,960
Why would they want that?

856
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:32,800
No, no, no, because it seems like they're unwilling to accept that you're not.

857
00:36:33,680 --> 00:36:36,720
So maybe you could just play into it for a little while.

858
00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:38,080
Because I think here's the thing.

859
00:36:38,080 --> 00:36:42,400
I think that maybe they have convinced themselves that they feel guilty about it.

860
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:47,440
And they feel like they need to like they feel like they need to feel guilty about it.

861
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:48,160
To get wet.

862
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:50,560
Well, no.

863
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:56,000
You don't have to do anything to appreciate yourself with these two to help them get it.

864
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:59,120
To help them get get get they craft noodles go.

865
00:36:59,120 --> 00:37:01,920
And I don't think you need to worry so much about that.

866
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:03,360
Because that's definitely what this is.

867
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:06,080
This this sex triangle you've just described.

868
00:37:06,080 --> 00:37:10,240
I was saying you could just pretend like it upset you for a little while and then forgive them.

869
00:37:10,240 --> 00:37:11,680
And then they would believe you.

870
00:37:11,680 --> 00:37:13,520
It had nothing to do with intercourse.

871
00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:14,880
Well, it's all means to end it, isn't it?

872
00:37:15,840 --> 00:37:17,120
Well, I mean, that's true.

873
00:37:17,120 --> 00:37:18,080
How is there intercourse?

874
00:37:18,080 --> 00:37:18,960
Have you asked them?

875
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:19,920
Probably not.

876
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:20,640
Do you guys want a Yahoo?

877
00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:21,760
Probably it hasn't come up.

878
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:24,400
I have a Yahoo that was sent in by Drew Davenport.

879
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:24,800
Thanks, Drew.

880
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:26,800
It's by Yahoo answers user Timmy who asks.

881
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:29,040
Am I really in a gang?

882
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:32,640
So I was playing some b-ball.

883
00:37:32,640 --> 00:37:35,280
That's short for basketball with friends.

884
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:36,320
Here's our ages.

885
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:37,040
Me 12.

886
00:37:37,600 --> 00:37:41,520
Friends 12 12 13 14 9.

887
00:37:42,080 --> 00:37:42,720
Wait, go back.

888
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:44,240
I just start over.

889
00:37:44,240 --> 00:37:45,520
I didn't have my pad and pen.

890
00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:45,760
Okay.

891
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:46,800
Okay, go ahead.

892
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:49,680
We're doing with three 12 13 14 and a nine.

893
00:37:51,040 --> 00:37:52,480
One of them is wearing red shoes.

894
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:53,600
Now one of them.

895
00:37:53,600 --> 00:37:56,000
One of them can't the 13 has a bag of corn.

896
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:57,200
The other has some chickens.

897
00:37:57,760 --> 00:37:58,720
We only have one boat.

898
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:01,440
They're playing some b-ball.

899
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:02,320
So they said, I'm sorry.

900
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:04,000
And b-ball is short for what now?

901
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:07,280
B-ball is short for basketball.

902
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:08,800
And so they were playing it.

903
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:10,320
They were their teens and tweens.

904
00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:15,120
And they say they are in an ICP Juggalo gang.

905
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:19,200
They supposedly jump me in.

906
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:21,600
Am I really in or what?

907
00:38:21,600 --> 00:38:25,200
What I think you may have just gotten beat up.

908
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:26,080
Did he?

909
00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:27,760
Did he feel the shiver?

910
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:29,120
What's the shiver?

911
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:32,320
You know, when when ICP comes over, yeah.

912
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:41,440
Are you saying that moment when you finally decide to start following the clown to get

913
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:45,920
down with the clown and when you accept the clown into your heart, commuting with nature

914
00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:50,000
and then like it's a beautiful sunshine day and then the rain starts falling and it's

915
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:53,840
cool and refreshing and you just you see the face.

916
00:38:53,840 --> 00:38:56,240
Yeah, that's a fucking miracle.

917
00:38:56,240 --> 00:38:58,000
It is a fucking miracle in the sky.

918
00:38:59,120 --> 00:39:02,240
And then your friends beat the ever loving fuck out of you.

919
00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:08,080
I mean, that's every second you see Violet J.

920
00:39:08,080 --> 00:39:10,640
But it turns out it's just your school's janitor crying.

921
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:14,080
I mean, you're in the gang.

922
00:39:14,080 --> 00:39:14,720
We've all been there.

923
00:39:16,240 --> 00:39:18,560
I don't think there's any doubt that you're in a gang now.

924
00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:20,640
I think we can actually speak louder than words.

925
00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:23,040
I mean, have you been participating in the gang?

926
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:26,560
Well, I mean, I think this happened.

927
00:39:26,560 --> 00:39:30,000
I think they're like literally writing this hurriedly on their phone after they just got

928
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:31,760
the shit after they just got jumped in.

929
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:36,240
I think not like after a couple of meetings and no, I think that would I think they would

930
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:41,840
fucking present that information if like he had to go out and buy all clown clothes like

931
00:39:41,840 --> 00:39:44,720
I think they've made me take the minutes.

932
00:39:44,720 --> 00:39:46,960
Is that something that the gang members do?

933
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:51,040
Yeah, it just that's going to look great on a college resume, by the way, and under extracurriculars.

934
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:53,760
We've done a lot of civic work.

935
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:55,600
We've been cleaning up the neighborhood.

936
00:39:55,600 --> 00:39:56,560
We adopted a highway.

937
00:39:57,360 --> 00:40:00,000
Young Lurch, can you review the minutes, please?

938
00:40:01,040 --> 00:40:06,320
Yeah, basically, Stinky Stan just talked about how his mom is a total bitch, and then we all

939
00:40:06,320 --> 00:40:09,440
pounded some faggot and went home and thanks.

940
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:10,000
Thank you.

941
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:11,280
Thank you, Little Lurch.

942
00:40:13,680 --> 00:40:15,200
I think you're in the gang is what I'm saying.

943
00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:18,960
There's no doubt about it, you're in a gang, you're in a gang, you're a gang member, you're

944
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:23,920
a gang banger, I think is the the the collective term.

945
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:28,000
The question is, is your gang a gang or not?

946
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:29,040
You're in a gang.

947
00:40:29,040 --> 00:40:32,960
Oh, but is the gang is the gang true?

948
00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:34,240
Is it a true gang?

949
00:40:34,240 --> 00:40:36,320
Now, if you're listening, does it follow the true path?

950
00:40:36,320 --> 00:40:38,880
If you listen to the feds, oh, they'll bust you for anything.

951
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:39,600
They'll bust it.

952
00:40:39,600 --> 00:40:42,960
Well, they think that they think anybody who's down for clown is part of a gang.

953
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:44,000
Yeah, that's what they think.

954
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:46,400
Part of a gang, that's what the FBI says, at least.

955
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:51,760
Now, now, Violent J said that he was going to and Shaggy 2 Dope said they were going

956
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:55,120
to take the feds to court over this.

957
00:40:55,120 --> 00:40:57,040
That hasn't materialized yet.

958
00:40:57,040 --> 00:40:59,600
But, you know, they've had a lot of empty promises in the past.

959
00:40:59,600 --> 00:41:05,040
So you're telling me that Juggalo Nation is like a fucking registered like FBI.

960
00:41:05,600 --> 00:41:09,920
Like if they see someone with a hatchet man tattoo, they are public enemy number one.

961
00:41:10,720 --> 00:41:11,200
Correct.

962
00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:16,800
They were classified as a a violent street gang by the FBI.

963
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:19,440
That's what the FBI said, that anybody down clown.

964
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:22,800
To be fair, that's also true of anyone that likes Dave Matthews Band.

965
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:25,680
Okay, that's fair.

966
00:41:25,680 --> 00:41:28,560
That guy blew the clarinetist for Dave Matthews Band.

967
00:41:28,560 --> 00:41:28,960
Get him.

968
00:41:30,560 --> 00:41:31,440
Gotta take him down.

969
00:41:32,320 --> 00:41:33,760
Where'd you get those Birkenstocks?

970
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:39,360
Just let Juggalo, just let Juggalos be Juggalos.

971
00:41:39,360 --> 00:41:42,800
I mean, it's literally I think it's all that Juggalo fans have.

972
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:46,160
It's like and I'm not hating you think we have.

973
00:41:46,160 --> 00:41:49,200
I think maybe even asked this question before if we have Juggalo listeners,

974
00:41:49,200 --> 00:41:51,440
because I don't think it's outside of the realm of possibilities.

975
00:41:52,160 --> 00:41:56,000
I think that our special brand of comedy.

976
00:41:56,000 --> 00:42:00,240
Yes, air quotes would greatly appeal to fans of the Juggalo Nation.

977
00:42:00,240 --> 00:42:04,720
If you if you can get on board with two men in clown makeup,

978
00:42:04,720 --> 00:42:11,920
I think that us talking about ghost horses, etc. It would be right if you're out.

979
00:42:11,920 --> 00:42:16,560
And you also have to think that at this at this point, at this point in society,

980
00:42:16,560 --> 00:42:18,080
Juggalos have heard it all.

981
00:42:18,080 --> 00:42:20,480
There's nothing we're going to say that they're not going to go.

982
00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:22,480
Listen, we see why you would feel that way.

983
00:42:22,480 --> 00:42:24,640
But let me give you a little bit of literature.

984
00:42:24,640 --> 00:42:25,680
I think will open your eyes.

985
00:42:25,680 --> 00:42:29,120
Juggalos think our show is a documentary is what I'm saying.

986
00:42:29,120 --> 00:42:32,240
They have seen all of this happen on on drug bridge.

987
00:42:32,240 --> 00:42:36,400
This is all this is all occurred before they've seen it in prophecy.

988
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:39,200
Everything that we've spoken of did.

989
00:42:39,200 --> 00:42:44,960
Do you guys know if the if they reveal the third card of the second deck yet in the dark carnival?

990
00:42:45,600 --> 00:42:47,760
You know, anybody heard?

991
00:42:47,760 --> 00:42:49,760
Are you talking about like the Stephen King books?

992
00:42:49,760 --> 00:42:51,680
I don't know what the fuck you're talking about right now.

993
00:42:52,560 --> 00:42:53,440
All right. You guys.

994
00:42:53,440 --> 00:42:58,880
OK, so the the the Juggalo everybody, if you haven't listened, read Nathan Rabin's book.

995
00:42:58,880 --> 00:43:00,000
You don't know me, but you don't like me.

996
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:05,840
It's a it's a book that simultaneously chronicles fish fandom and Juggalo fandom.

997
00:43:06,560 --> 00:43:08,720
Are fish fans considered dangerous by the FBI?

998
00:43:10,720 --> 00:43:14,320
They're considered a highly dangerously mellow dangerously.

999
00:43:14,320 --> 00:43:17,120
They are murderers because they're like, hey, listen, this one song.

1000
00:43:17,120 --> 00:43:20,160
And then you're like afterwards, you're like, oh, yeah, that was great.

1001
00:43:20,160 --> 00:43:21,920
Oh, my God, I'm 86 years old.

1002
00:43:21,920 --> 00:43:22,560
And then you die.

1003
00:43:25,280 --> 00:43:26,240
They're like the angels.

1004
00:43:26,240 --> 00:43:29,520
I was a young man and now I'm an old man.

1005
00:43:29,520 --> 00:43:30,320
You looked away.

1006
00:43:31,360 --> 00:43:33,120
You looked away from the groove.

1007
00:43:34,240 --> 00:43:36,480
There are the group don't blink.

1008
00:43:36,480 --> 00:43:38,480
Also, don't listen.

1009
00:43:38,480 --> 00:43:39,680
It's not good.

1010
00:43:40,320 --> 00:43:40,720
It's not.

1011
00:43:44,320 --> 00:43:45,760
I bet he's going to do the next.

1012
00:43:45,760 --> 00:43:46,160
Nope.

1013
00:43:46,160 --> 00:43:46,800
Oh, fuck.

1014
00:43:46,800 --> 00:43:48,160
Sixty years went by.

1015
00:43:48,160 --> 00:43:48,880
Shit.

1016
00:43:48,880 --> 00:43:51,120
I supposed to pick my kids up from soccer practice.

1017
00:43:51,120 --> 00:43:52,240
They're definitely skeletons.

1018
00:43:52,240 --> 00:43:59,760
I hope someone raised and fed my my children and picked them up from soccer practice.

1019
00:43:59,760 --> 00:44:00,560
I hope they weren't wolves.

1020
00:44:02,480 --> 00:44:03,520
I like fish.

1021
00:44:03,520 --> 00:44:04,880
Shut the fuck up.

1022
00:44:04,880 --> 00:44:05,600
You shut up.

1023
00:44:06,480 --> 00:44:09,920
OK, so I'm going to give you the brief summation of this because I know we don't have much time.

1024
00:44:09,920 --> 00:44:12,000
The dark carnival is the afterlife, right?

1025
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:13,920
That's what that's what ICP says.

1026
00:44:13,920 --> 00:44:15,600
They have that sounds terrible.

1027
00:44:15,600 --> 00:44:18,160
That's like the opposite of what most churches espouse.

1028
00:44:19,120 --> 00:44:20,080
OK, yes, correct.

1029
00:44:20,080 --> 00:44:30,160
There are there is they have basically instead of a Bible, what they have is the the Joker's deck, right?

1030
00:44:30,160 --> 00:44:38,880
So the Joker's cards are in two decks and each album is a Joker's card in the deck.

1031
00:44:38,880 --> 00:44:42,400
So the first deck was like the first six albums.

1032
00:44:42,400 --> 00:44:43,520
I think the last one was death.

1033
00:44:43,520 --> 00:44:48,480
And then they came back and they were like, wait a minute, we didn't allow for enough prophecy.

1034
00:44:48,480 --> 00:44:53,280
We were honestly underestimating how much prophecy we'd have.

1035
00:44:53,280 --> 00:44:57,680
We've got a second deck of Joker's cards and we've only seen two of those so far.

1036
00:44:58,480 --> 00:45:05,440
Bang, Wham, Boom and the Mighty Death Pop are the two the first two cards in the second deck.

1037
00:45:05,440 --> 00:45:08,160
So we're eagerly awaiting what the third card.

1038
00:45:08,160 --> 00:45:09,920
Are we at Justin?

1039
00:45:09,920 --> 00:45:10,800
Hey, Justin.

1040
00:45:10,800 --> 00:45:11,440
Yeah.

1041
00:45:11,440 --> 00:45:12,880
Are you proud of yourself?

1042
00:45:12,880 --> 00:45:14,400
I feel pretty good about it right now.

1043
00:45:14,400 --> 00:45:16,160
Juggalo Church camp right now.

1044
00:45:16,160 --> 00:45:20,480
Like it's just about to bust out an acoustic guitar and just play three chords.

1045
00:45:20,480 --> 00:45:24,480
OK, so yes, ladies and gentlemen, here's the juggler.

1046
00:45:25,120 --> 00:45:26,720
He'll cut your windpipe.

1047
00:45:28,560 --> 00:45:30,880
This first beat on my bracelet represents.

1048
00:45:30,880 --> 00:45:32,400
Thank you, ICP Jesus.

1049
00:45:33,840 --> 00:45:35,520
Anybody feeling moved, come down.

1050
00:45:35,520 --> 00:45:36,640
Everybody touch Mike.

1051
00:45:37,280 --> 00:45:39,280
Everybody touch and cry over Mike.

1052
00:45:39,280 --> 00:45:41,600
He'll cut your motherfucking heart out.

1053
00:45:44,880 --> 00:45:45,840
Beautiful night outside.

1054
00:45:45,840 --> 00:45:46,720
Anybody feeling moved?

1055
00:45:48,960 --> 00:45:51,440
Who wants to stand up and rededicate their life?

1056
00:45:52,240 --> 00:45:53,360
You're all going to go home tomorrow.

1057
00:45:53,360 --> 00:45:55,120
You're not going to see that girl you're crushing on again.

1058
00:45:55,680 --> 00:45:59,840
You can see this feature at the world famous Carnival of Carnage.

1059
00:45:59,840 --> 00:46:00,320
Anyone?

1060
00:46:00,960 --> 00:46:01,440
Anyone?

1061
00:46:02,560 --> 00:46:05,360
This is my one fucking show a year.

1062
00:46:06,400 --> 00:46:07,920
Keep keep juggling, motherfuckers.

1063
00:46:07,920 --> 00:46:09,840
When you go home, take that message home.

1064
00:46:09,840 --> 00:46:10,720
Keep on juggling.

1065
00:46:11,760 --> 00:46:12,800
Keep on juggling.

1066
00:46:12,800 --> 00:46:13,440
Never stop.

1067
00:46:13,440 --> 00:46:15,760
Thank you so much for listening to our program.

1068
00:46:15,760 --> 00:46:16,800
We hope you enjoyed it.

1069
00:46:17,920 --> 00:46:20,000
Want to thank everybody tweeting about the show.

1070
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:30,000
Like Jeslyn Zagrafas, John Rom, Amanda Waka, Schmoozy, Greg, Aru, Ernesto, Chris Gard,

1071
00:46:31,600 --> 00:46:38,560
Aru, again, Andrew, Chris Mantle, Evan Weston, Jade Rogers, Luke Foran.

1072
00:46:38,560 --> 00:46:40,480
Thank you so much for tweeting about our program.

1073
00:46:40,480 --> 00:46:45,520
When you do that, please use the nbambam hashtag and try to share a sampler.

1074
00:46:45,520 --> 00:46:49,360
If you think about it, it's bit.ly forward slash nbambam2013.

1075
00:46:49,360 --> 00:46:51,520
Also, thanks again to Hulu Plus.

1076
00:46:51,520 --> 00:46:52,020
Oh, yeah.

1077
00:46:52,800 --> 00:46:54,880
Make sure to check out Hulu Plus if you haven't already.

1078
00:46:54,880 --> 00:46:55,600
I assume you have.

1079
00:46:55,600 --> 00:46:58,160
You can check out thousands of hit shows anytime, anywhere.

1080
00:46:58,160 --> 00:47:00,480
And don't forget the extended free trial.

1081
00:47:00,480 --> 00:47:06,800
You can get that by going to huluplus.com slash my brother and then huluplus.com.

1082
00:47:06,800 --> 00:47:09,280
Then the forward slash, that one that kind of like leans.

1083
00:47:09,280 --> 00:47:09,780
Which one?

1084
00:47:09,780 --> 00:47:12,120
Because there's two of those that you just described.

1085
00:47:12,120 --> 00:47:13,800
It kind of leans into it.

1086
00:47:15,960 --> 00:47:19,640
Yeah, even if you if I hear you out there, you're like, oh, but I don't watch TV.

1087
00:47:19,640 --> 00:47:24,920
Just think of it as a $7.99 subscription to ANTM 2.0 Boys in the House.

1088
00:47:24,920 --> 00:47:29,720
If you don't if you don't watch it, nobody you're not going to have anything to talk to to anyone.

1089
00:47:30,680 --> 00:47:32,280
A special PSA.

1090
00:47:32,280 --> 00:47:35,960
We are not going to have an episode next week because Travis is leaving.

1091
00:47:35,960 --> 00:47:39,960
I might make a Greatest Hits episode from the second deck.

1092
00:47:41,560 --> 00:47:42,440
That's good.

1093
00:47:42,440 --> 00:47:43,160
People seem to like that.

1094
00:47:43,160 --> 00:47:44,760
So how long are you going to be in Scotland, Travis?

1095
00:47:45,800 --> 00:47:46,520
10 days.

1096
00:47:46,520 --> 00:47:47,160
Oh, yeah.

1097
00:47:47,160 --> 00:47:47,640
OK.

1098
00:47:47,640 --> 00:47:49,720
Yeah, you should probably whip up one of those juicers.

1099
00:47:49,720 --> 00:47:52,920
I do want to say if you want to get in a good mood, and this is a shameless plug,

1100
00:47:52,920 --> 00:47:55,240
but I know it's kind of a long shot.

1101
00:47:55,240 --> 00:47:59,400
But my wife, Sydney, and I, who you may know from the Max Button podcast,

1102
00:47:59,400 --> 00:48:00,760
Sawbones, we directed a musical.

1103
00:48:00,760 --> 00:48:01,880
It's birds playing Superman.

1104
00:48:02,520 --> 00:48:04,680
And you got one last chance to see it this weekend.

1105
00:48:04,680 --> 00:48:08,200
And it's in Huntington, West Virginia, of course, at Huntington High School.

1106
00:48:08,200 --> 00:48:11,320
And it's Friday and Saturday at seven and Sunday at two.

1107
00:48:11,320 --> 00:48:17,960
So if you can come by, I will personally come give you a huge hug and chill with you.

1108
00:48:17,960 --> 00:48:21,160
We actually had some folks come up from Philadelphia.

1109
00:48:21,160 --> 00:48:21,960
Oh, you're kidding me.

1110
00:48:21,960 --> 00:48:23,960
People drove down from Philadelphia to see.

1111
00:48:23,960 --> 00:48:27,720
Yes, my new best friends, Lori and Hal, drove all the way from Philadelphia,

1112
00:48:27,720 --> 00:48:30,040
chilled in Huntington, went to Hillbilly Hot Dogs,

1113
00:48:30,040 --> 00:48:32,680
had a heck of a time, had a blast on their road trip.

1114
00:48:32,680 --> 00:48:34,760
You are offering a guaranteed hang.

1115
00:48:35,400 --> 00:48:37,400
This is a full, full.

1116
00:48:37,400 --> 00:48:38,040
You come down.

1117
00:48:38,040 --> 00:48:38,760
We're going to hug.

1118
00:48:38,760 --> 00:48:39,480
We're going to chat.

1119
00:48:41,160 --> 00:48:42,760
You can see my childhood home.

1120
00:48:42,760 --> 00:48:44,280
You can see where I went to school.

1121
00:48:44,280 --> 00:48:46,520
You can see where I became me.

1122
00:48:46,520 --> 00:48:47,560
Another shameless plug.

1123
00:48:47,560 --> 00:48:50,680
Our childhood home has been for sale for like two years.

1124
00:48:50,680 --> 00:48:54,200
If you want to buy our childhood home and just like live there in Huntington,

1125
00:48:54,200 --> 00:48:58,440
Justin will hang out with you every day.

1126
00:48:58,440 --> 00:49:02,840
Please, please remove this enormous sickening financial burden from our dad.

1127
00:49:03,400 --> 00:49:05,320
Please buy this fucking house.

1128
00:49:05,320 --> 00:49:06,520
Please buy our childhood home.

1129
00:49:06,520 --> 00:49:09,640
Our dad has no money saved because of this fucking money pip.

1130
00:49:09,640 --> 00:49:11,640
Can we do a Kickstarter to buy our house?

1131
00:49:11,640 --> 00:49:13,960
And then just burn it to the fucking ground.

1132
00:49:13,960 --> 00:49:17,160
We'll make it an Airbnb for NBNBA fans who want to come visit.

1133
00:49:17,160 --> 00:49:18,040
Simple offer.

1134
00:49:18,040 --> 00:49:21,720
Go to Huntington, see the sites, go see Justin's show.

1135
00:49:21,720 --> 00:49:23,640
Buy our fucking house, please.

1136
00:49:25,640 --> 00:49:26,760
Thank you so much for listening.

1137
00:49:26,760 --> 00:49:27,400
Great neighborhood.

1138
00:49:27,400 --> 00:49:28,760
Also, thank you to John.

1139
00:49:28,760 --> 00:49:30,440
Thank you to John Roderick in the long winter.

1140
00:49:30,440 --> 00:49:32,440
Yes, of course, for our theme song.

1141
00:49:32,440 --> 00:49:34,200
It's a departure off the album.

1142
00:49:34,200 --> 00:49:35,240
Putting the days to bed.

1143
00:49:35,240 --> 00:49:37,560
You can buy it at iTunes retailers.

1144
00:49:37,560 --> 00:49:38,680
Don't Spotify it.

1145
00:49:38,680 --> 00:49:45,080
I've been hearing some bad shit about Spotify and Pandora lately that that they're haunted.

1146
00:49:45,080 --> 00:49:45,720
They're haunted.

1147
00:49:45,720 --> 00:49:46,600
They're full of ghosts.

1148
00:49:46,600 --> 00:49:48,360
Every third song you hear on there is a ghost.

1149
00:49:48,360 --> 00:49:49,000
Anyway, thank you, John.

1150
00:49:50,520 --> 00:49:55,400
Griffin, we got we got a long layover until our next episodes.

1151
00:49:55,400 --> 00:49:58,920
I hope you got a great one to take us on a journey.

1152
00:49:58,920 --> 00:49:59,400
Yeah, sure.

1153
00:49:59,400 --> 00:50:01,000
This one was sent in by Ashley Burgart.

1154
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:01,640
Thanks, Ashley.

1155
00:50:01,640 --> 00:50:03,800
It's by Yahoo Answers user Caitlin, who asks,

1156
00:50:05,560 --> 00:50:07,720
where can I get some spaghetti in Denver?

1157
00:50:11,080 --> 00:50:12,360
I'm Justin McElroy.

1158
00:50:12,360 --> 00:50:13,560
I'm Travis McElroy.

1159
00:50:13,560 --> 00:50:14,920
I'm Ray Romano.

1160
00:50:14,920 --> 00:50:15,720
No, that was terrible.

1161
00:50:15,720 --> 00:50:16,440
Can I try again?

1162
00:50:16,440 --> 00:50:17,960
I'm Henry Romano.

1163
00:50:17,960 --> 00:50:19,000
That was pretty good.

1164
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:19,640
That was pretty good.

1165
00:50:19,640 --> 00:50:20,840
It's been my brother, my brother and me.

1166
00:50:20,840 --> 00:50:21,720
Kiss your dad.

1167
00:50:21,720 --> 00:50:26,920
Square on the lips.
