1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:30,720
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:46,960
Hello everybody and welcome to my brother and my brother made an advice show for the

6
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:51,360
modern era. I'm your oldest brother Justin McElroy. I'm your middle-aged brother Travis

7
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:56,240
McElroy. I'm your sweet baby brother Griffin McElroy, don't you know? We did it America.

8
00:00:56,240 --> 00:01:02,000
Yeah, we did it everybody. Yeah, I don't know that this is necessarily good intro fodder,

9
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:08,160
like obviously I'm happy that we did a television show, and to be back home with all of my

10
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:15,760
novelty coffee mugs and my wife and stuff, but all we really did was work for three weeks.

11
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:23,760
What? How are people doing it out there day to day? We get so many emails from people and it's

12
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:28,640
like life is really hard for me right now. Thank you all for being such a shining light in that

13
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:35,760
hard time and they always find those emails very confusing because it's like no, life is very easy.

14
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:41,520
It's very easy and good. You do like an hour of work and then people listen to it and it's good

15
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:46,320
and you're good baby. And it's good, like you do one hour of work, like that's almost a break

16
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:54,640
from the leisure, you know? But like this thing we did with the TV show, working every day is

17
00:01:54,640 --> 00:02:01,760
honestly, it's taken a genuine toll on me sort of physio spiritually.

18
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:07,360
Yeah, the other day I came out of the HQ where we were filming and I was walking down the street

19
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:11,760
and this construction worker who was like just covered in dirt and dust and he'd been

20
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:17,840
jackhammering all day. He looked at me and he said, you poor soul, do you need to sit down

21
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:21,360
for a second? Do you need to take a break? And I said, thank you so much. And he said,

22
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:24,320
I don't need this water as much as you do. And he gave me his water.

23
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:26,160
That was cool of him.

24
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:32,480
Yeah, I think he just recognized how hard I had been working and I really appreciated it.

25
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:40,960
I heard the song Five O'Clock Somewhere and I never understood why all the excitement.

26
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:47,280
And then I finally got it. But get this gang, sometimes we weren't done by five.

27
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:52,480
Which is crazy. We would say it's five o'clock somewhere, but it would be in a mournful tone

28
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:57,920
because it was 10 where we were and we still had to work. And we did six episodes of this

29
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:04,880
television show and it took three weeks and I almost died. Hey, Frasier, how'd you do it?

30
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:11,440
Cause you did a billion episodes, Kelsey. You did a billion episodes Kelsey and as far as I can tell,

31
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:13,680
you're okay. You're fine.

32
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:20,720
I cannot begin to convey to the audience listening how often during this process

33
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:22,480
we talked about Frasier.

34
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:26,240
Well, because it's unthinkable, Travis, what Kelsey accomplished.

35
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:36,160
Well, I will say this. In our defense, Kelsey had a bunch of people helping him make up the jokes

36
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:42,400
and the three of us just had only about four or five other people to help us create the jokes.

37
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:46,640
Each one of them was worth three people. So that's 12 to 15.

38
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:46,960
Easily.

39
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:52,880
But here's what you don't know. Not a lot of people know this. The writing staff on Frasier, 123 people.

40
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:59,520
That's amazing. There was a year there where Will Smith legally was in every movie.

41
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:03,040
And he was also writing for Frasier.

42
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:08,800
He's writing for Frasier and also he put out a Big Willy style or Wilinium. How did you do that, bud?

43
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:14,000
I would love to see the pictures of Will Smith on set for Independence Day. And in one hand,

44
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:19,120
he's got a pen writing Big Willy style. And in his left hand, he's got a pen writing Frasier

45
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:26,000
because he's ambidextrous and can write a hit musical album and a great script about how

46
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:31,920
like Niles is super in love with Daphne, like at the same time.

47
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:34,400
Making fun of a certain type of wine.

48
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:38,320
What you didn't know about Will Smith is that in every movie he is in,

49
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:47,600
there is always a comfortable king size bed just directly off frame that he lays down in and goes

50
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:52,640
hard to sleep between every take. So it's literally like, you know the difference between you and me?

51
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:58,240
I make this look good. Just falls down and it's just like full Huey Dewey Louie.

52
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:01,520
Snoring like a swan.

53
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:05,040
A feather raising up and down over his mouth as he snores.

54
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:05,840
Yes, absolutely.

55
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:13,040
The hard thing is getting him into the nightgown because it often covers his microphone.

56
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:19,040
Well, he's got a Rawls and Gromit-esque machine that basically cut door open.

57
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:25,760
He falls through hands, hands, clothes, shirt, nightshirt, cap, and then feather over lips.

58
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:30,000
He breathes. It goes up and down. And then it's like, OK, well, we're back.

59
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:35,120
Bed springs him back up. He goes through his costume and now he's suddenly just fully dressed

60
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:39,360
for it. And now he's back to making Hancock. You know what I mean? That's his day.

61
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:46,800
My initial revelation upon making a TV show for three weeks was that I needed to be nicer to

62
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:54,160
everybody who had made a TV show before because it's so hard. But I think maybe what I mean is

63
00:05:54,160 --> 00:06:00,480
anybody who has a job to work. Like if you do a job every day, like my blessings to you,

64
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:06,080
Effendi, because that is a very difficult gig you got going. And by which I mean any job.

65
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:08,400
Any jobs that require

66
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:17,440
consistent amounts of work. Do you think when a new Hollywood it girl or boy is like starting to

67
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:22,480
come up, they have a like when Chris Pratt did Guardians of the Galaxy and it was like, well,

68
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:25,840
he's in everything now. Do you think he had a moment after Guardians where he was like,

69
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:32,080
oh, God, like he saw it sort of like a tall wave about to crash down on him?

70
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:37,520
Like, oh, Jesus, God, no, I got too much heat. I'm too buzzy. I got too much heat. I gotta go.

71
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:39,120
I gotta go.

72
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:43,280
It's like when a spaceship like re-enters the atmosphere. You know what I mean? Like

73
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:46,480
you start picking up speed towards the earth and like those just

74
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:50,000
flame waves start emanating from in front of Chris Pratt's face.

75
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:54,000
He was doing like 10 movies. And then he was also in Jurassic World,

76
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,120
which is like the biggest movie ever. And then when he did Jurassic World, they're like,

77
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:59,920
you know, dog, we're going to make eight more of these, right? And you're in all of them.

78
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:06,080
He's like, oh, Jesus, God, Jesus, what I do. How about let's get into stuff. Thank you.

79
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:09,120
If you work a full time job, hats off to you.

80
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:14,240
I also want to say I love you, brother, so much. But I'm also really glad we're all in

81
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:15,280
different rooms now.

82
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:20,320
Oh, man. Yeah, I had to watch you guys eat so many meals. And that's my least favorite of the things.

83
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:25,280
I love so many things about you. But watching your faces while we record podcasts is not one

84
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:25,680
of them.

85
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:27,760
It really stinks.

86
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:33,360
I really feel like I've reunited with my two best podcast buddies after they were replaced

87
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:35,280
by pod people for three weeks.

88
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:38,640
Fantasy Justin and Fantasy Griffin are two of my favorite people in the world.

89
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:42,720
Yeah, my favorite thing about fantasy microphone Travis and Justin is that they don't need to

90
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:49,840
eat. They just sort of subsist on like making internet jokes. And so they don't they don't

91
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:54,080
have to eat food. And I don't have to hear or see that happen. It's a real it's really

92
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:54,960
delightful.

93
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:58,880
People ask us, how do you guys keep such good relationships? I'm not that close to my brother

94
00:07:58,880 --> 00:08:07,360
and sister. The answer, if I take my headphones off, they disappear.

95
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:08,320
Here's our first question.

96
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:09,040
Yeah.

97
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:13,920
I haven't seen one of my best friends in two years. She lives in Texas. I live in New York.

98
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:17,840
In a month, she'll be visiting D.C. and I'm going down to see her. But we'll be staying

99
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:22,960
with a different friend who lives in D.C. How do I tell the D.C. friend I'm staying

100
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:27,760
with that I want to spend time with my friend from Texas without my D.C. friend getting

101
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:31,680
offended? Or is this a non-issue? I don't want her to feel like I'm visiting D.C. just

102
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:34,000
to see my Texas friend. I'm excited to see both.

103
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:36,400
That's from Troubled in Brooklyn.

104
00:08:37,040 --> 00:08:43,920
This is like so pertinent because like while we were in Huntington, goofing aside, like

105
00:08:43,920 --> 00:08:47,840
we were doing 12 hour days every day and I didn't have a lot of time to like get out

106
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:53,120
and see folks. And that's not like it's not a burden to get out and see my friends. But

107
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:57,920
it was it was it was tricky like trying to figure out the schedule on how to do that.

108
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:03,360
But also, I mean, I also come in town to hang out with my family. And so it's it's hard to

109
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:07,440
like say, OK, I'm going to take some time away from hanging with this group of people

110
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:10,240
who I don't get to see very often to hang out with this group of people who I never

111
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:15,520
get to see. It's a this is a this is a really tricky, tricky thing, especially if you're

112
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:18,800
the type of person who like all of your friends have moved away or you moved away from all

113
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:22,640
your friends. It can be it can be really difficult.

114
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:28,800
I my question would be with these two friends get along because there's always the option

115
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:33,760
of like making it an all inclusive thing. And rather than like looking at your friends

116
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:38,160
you're staying with and saying like, OK, well, I'll see you again in six hours. Like

117
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:41,760
say, hey, my friend and I are going to the museum. Do you want to go?

118
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:45,600
But that that can be so bad if they're not if they are not friends in the way that

119
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:50,160
you and the other person are friends. Like it's it's going to be weird because you're

120
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:55,520
going to want to like if I wanted to hang out with like one of my old Huntington friends

121
00:09:56,560 --> 00:10:01,680
while I was staying with like one of my Chicago friends, like I and I saw my Huntington friend

122
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:04,640
and I didn't you know, I haven't seen them in a while. And when I catch up, we would

123
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:08,640
probably talk about a bunch of shit that the Chicago friend wouldn't get and vice versa.

124
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:13,440
Not not that like we have a secret language, secret friendship language. But but you know

125
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:18,080
what I mean? Like that can also be that can also be very you can really ostracize one

126
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:24,400
of the people if you if you do it like that. Yeah, but the difference between like Airbnb

127
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:29,680
with someone and staying with a friend is that you hang out with them. So like if your friend

128
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:34,800
is letting you stay in their home and then you basically just like only see them in the morning

129
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:40,480
before you go out to do other things and only see them at night when you come home and go to sleep,

130
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:43,280
like that's not you're kind of taking advantage of it, you know?

131
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:49,520
I tell me if I'm wrong, brothers, because I and I know that we are not a good sample size because

132
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:57,680
we are alike in many ways. But for me, my assumption is no one has ever had someone stay

133
00:10:57,680 --> 00:11:04,480
with them from out of town. And not at least some point thought, man, I hope they plan some things

134
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:10,240
to do. Yeah, this is exactly right. Yeah, like absolutely right. Nobody can handle the pressure

135
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:16,320
of like trying to make sure that you're having a good time constantly. Like that would be I don't

136
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:21,440
think anybody actually wants that. Not only that, depending on the length of your stay, you're

137
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:27,280
probably going to hit a point where they will want some some alone time. I am so not offended

138
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:30,720
by this. Like when I have friends who come in and stay with us while they're in Austin, like

139
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:36,080
I'm I'm happy to put them up and then I get to hang out with them at our house, which is my

140
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:42,800
favorite place to hang out because it's where all my novelty coffee mugs is. But I don't I don't get

141
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:48,400
offended when they want to go and do other stuff, especially if it's stuff I don't want to do, like

142
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:53,840
hang out with your dumb friend. Yeah, I would say that the key is to find the balance of like, it

143
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:58,400
can't be the first day you get there. It can't be like if you get in Friday night, you spend all day

144
00:11:58,400 --> 00:12:08,720
with friend number two, but like number two. But that like, you know, you find a good balance and

145
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:12,720
you make sure you're not shortchanging one friend to hang out with the other, especially if they've

146
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:18,400
opened their home up to you. Yeah, but yeah, I agree. It's always okay to find a little bit of

147
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:26,160
time. One other side note, you're going from New York to D.C. That's three hours. That's about 45

148
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:32,080
minutes. Deepest Congo. It's not like a once in a lifetime. Yeah. Eat, pray, love style journey

149
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:37,360
to India together. Like you're going to you're taking a train. You're like, you can come back

150
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:44,320
tomorrow. The train costs four dollars. Like it's unacceptable. You're fine. Just go back later if

151
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:49,120
their butter. How about I like I do like that you and your friend from Texas are doing like a

152
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:53,680
Centralia, Pennsylvania thing. Yeah, I'm like neither one of you wants to travel to New York

153
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:59,760
or Texas, but you'll meet in the middle in D.C. I think that's fun. How about this Yahoo? It's

154
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:06,160
from sending by Dan Green. Thank you, Dan. It's by Yahoo answers user human animal. It's posted

155
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:13,840
in pregnancy and parenting, newborn and baby, which is not accurate. But they said, what do bees

156
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:22,480
use honey for? Is it their food? That's it. No further additional details. And before I go any

157
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:26,800
further into like the really entertaining part of this, just curious if you guys have any sort

158
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:33,920
of initial thoughts on what bees are doing with that good sticky stuff in there. Yes, it's food

159
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:40,480
for their babies, I believe. They get the just like, let's let's let's sort of just like lay out

160
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:46,320
sort of how planet earth stuff. So there's the queen bee and she's like, go get me that pollen

161
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:51,840
sun. And so they go out and they do get her that pollen sun. Well, it would actually be pollen

162
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:57,600
daughter, because I believe only worker bees are all female. No one. That's no one. So anyway,

163
00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:03,040
maybe worker bees are male. And then the fighter bees are female. Really knows how that works. So

164
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:08,880
let's not big bad beetleborgs are all male, right? No, I think there was I think there was a woman

165
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:16,480
one. Shit. Shit. So anyway, bees have, I guess, mad hair on their thorax. And they just sort of

166
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:22,080
rub up in the pollen, bring that home. The pollen somehow, hmm, this is where this is where things

167
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:26,000
get a little bit crazy, because no one is quite sure what happens in the hive. They put it into

168
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:33,280
like oak barrels, I think. Yeah, like an agent. And they choose a perfection. Yeah, they go out. And

169
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:38,800
if I remember from the movie bugs life, they come back. And they go through basically what equates

170
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:44,160
to a carwash that then like scrubs the pond off of them and turns it into honey, if I remember

171
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:48,640
correctly, based on what I remember from a bee movie, they get the pollen, they bring it back,

172
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:54,880
they tell some really funny jokes, and then they fuck a human woman. If I remember correctly,

173
00:14:54,880 --> 00:15:02,160
if I remember correct, so the honey, once they have the honey, do they eat the pollen? Or do

174
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:08,400
they eat the honey? Is the honey just sort of a Griffin flower? Do you eat bread? This is an

175
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:12,640
excellent point. But like, does that mean every time we crack open one of those big places,

176
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:17,840
we are essentially smashing in their home and being like, hello? Oh, what is this bee food? You

177
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:22,000
need this to live? Delightful. I'll have all of it. Scrape, scrape, scrape. We're all having a lot

178
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:28,240
of fun here, but it's their dookie, right? Like honey is bee dookie? It could be. Another thing

179
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:37,760
I'm worried about. I feel like this is the most like rote line of comedic thinking that maybe

180
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:42,720
exists at this point, but in this particular instance, I think it's worth talking about. I

181
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:49,840
want to know who the discoverer of honey was, right? Like this joke is played, like the first

182
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:55,200
person to suck a cow's teeth was like, this is good. I'll have this. This is called milk. That's

183
00:15:55,200 --> 00:16:03,040
play, but it really is quite insane that somebody was like, what is this? Bugs live in here?

184
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:10,640
Bugs that have needles on them full of poison, and also there's a million of them. I'm going to eat

185
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:16,560
whatever I find in there. Hello. I can't exactly what happened, Griffin. Somebody saw a hungry old

186
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:23,120
bear getting himself a smackerel of honey. That's what happened. Look at that sticky mess on that

187
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:28,720
bear's maw. That looks delicious. I want to get myself a smackerel of honey. So they grab the bear

188
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:34,320
and they pin it to the ground. They lick the honey up the face. Exactly. The bear was like,

189
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:39,600
what are you doing? No, please stop. It would be very scary if you were the bear.

190
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:46,880
I'm just going to read some answers now. Yahoo Answers user anonymous says, yes,

191
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:53,040
honey is their food. Okay. One person suggests that they use honey to lure humans in to remove

192
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:57,600
it from their hive by cutting that part of the hive off, and then they put it in a bucket and

193
00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:07,520
sell it in town. I think they're suggesting that bees work together with humans to like,

194
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:14,000
oh, I hate this part of the hive. I want it to get removed. Let's create a literal honey pot scenario

195
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:18,800
where a person comes in and helps us break apart the parts of our hive that we don't want anymore.

196
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:25,760
Can you imagine if an insect was like that aware of humans to that level? Like if an ant was like,

197
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:30,800
you know what? I hate this old anthill we've got. Let's go attack that picnic so people will come

198
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:36,720
over and destroy it and then we can build a new one. So I mean, going down here though,

199
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:42,160
someone says nectar from flowers is food for bees. They make honey. They don't use it for food.

200
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:46,880
They don't use it for food. Honey is made from pollen and nectar for winter. As we can food for

201
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:52,080
the winter, they prefer fresh food like we do. So which one is it? No, I don't think anybody

202
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:56,640
knows what honey is. I don't think anybody knows what honey is all about, but we're eating it every

203
00:17:56,640 --> 00:18:04,880
day. The best answer I can find is the worst. It's the pits. Oh no. Bees fly around. Okay.

204
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:10,480
And then they gobble up the honey. Okay. Right. But they store it. They gobble up the nectar,

205
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:16,000
right? Yeah. And they store it in a special tummy just for nectar. Good. That's fine. Then

206
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:22,720
when we get back to the hive, they barf it up. Yes. But it's wet. So other bees flap their wings

207
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:29,760
to dry it until it's delicious honey. Damn bees, that's a lot of work. Wait,

208
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:34,960
where's the wax come from then? Where's the wax come from? Another unanswered question. And why

209
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:40,720
do they need all this fucking wax and honey? How are they flavoring it? How are they flavoring it?

210
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:47,520
How do they make it honey flavor? Bees, thank you. Thank you, bees. Because you make shit that you

211
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:54,320
don't need and probably don't even want. But I want it very much, bees. Thank you. This is excellent

212
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:58,960
work you're doing. With all this wax and honey in there, I bet it's real sexy in a beehive.

213
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:05,120
Yeah. Spiders make silk, right? But they need that shit to make their webs and shit. That's fine.

214
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:09,360
Bees are making wax. Bees are making honey. I don't even think they know what they're doing.

215
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:13,040
I don't think we spent enough time talking about how sexy it is in the beehive, Griffin. Can we

216
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:18,560
go back to just talking about like super sexy erotic- Oh, just tight fucking wet sticky quarters.

217
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:24,560
Just a bunch of- I mean, there's only one person getting laid, right? And that's the queen, right?

218
00:19:24,560 --> 00:19:33,840
I think that's it. And she makes the larvae. What? No, they give royal jelly to one of the larvae

219
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:39,280
and it eats it and it becomes the queen. It's a mega vitamin that gives it super

220
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:44,720
powers and it turns into the queen. Or you could put it on your face. That's another option.

221
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:52,160
Boy, I bet that is unoffensive to bees. Yeah. I'd rather you did it, Hooman.

222
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:59,440
Bees have it rough, but also they nasty. Bees are quite nasty just barfing on each

223
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:06,400
other and fucking nonstop and like shitting out stuff that I love. I love your shit, bees.

224
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:10,000
And I'm sorry that you're like disappearing or whatever. Actually, is that even a thing?

225
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:14,080
I don't hear about that so much anymore. I guess we solved it. Oh, they're back.

226
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:17,840
Oh, they're back. Good. We solved it. What did we do? Can we do that for the other animals?

227
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:24,480
I think we just asked the bees, like, where'd they go? Did they see anybody else there that

228
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:29,680
we should get? Oh, did they go? They went somewhere to hide for a bit,

229
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:32,640
but then they came back and we're like, no, we're good. Stop freaking out.

230
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:38,800
Everybody chill. Hey humans, it's fine. We had to go to our home planet to defend it.

231
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:42,480
We had to do, we did a quick sort of workplace retreat to like,

232
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:48,240
determine what we're doing vis-a-vis honey and wax. Cause we hate the stuff. We hate this stuff.

233
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:52,000
Hey, why are we making all this stuff? I don't know. Didn't, I thought you said,

234
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:55,760
Noah, I thought you said we were supposed to make, wait, hold on. Does anyone know why

235
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:59,920
we're making this stuff? Yeah. Steve, do you know why we're making honey?

236
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:05,040
I hate all this sticky stuff. Recently, a new employee joined my workplace

237
00:21:05,040 --> 00:21:09,760
when another coworker described something as tasting like pineapple. The new employee

238
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:13,360
claimed he didn't know what that meant as he had never tasted pineapple before.

239
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:20,320
How does this happen to adults? His explanation was that he had no pineapple

240
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:23,920
available where he grew up, but he is from central Illinois.

241
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:28,800
Eat a fruit salad, motherfucker. The Midwest is not exactly the forefront

242
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:33,680
of tropical cuisine, but pineapple is literally everywhere in American cuisine.

243
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:36,560
Further, he admitted he has never tried a peach or a pear.

244
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:44,560
Amazingly, he has tried and likes papayas. So it's not just fruits that begin with the letter P.

245
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:49,600
It also, it also is not that he doesn't like how they taste as he's never,

246
00:21:50,160 --> 00:21:55,680
honestly, truly never tried them. Is there a tactful way to convince him to give these foods

247
00:21:55,680 --> 00:22:01,280
a chance? Other advice for helping him develop a basic flavor literacy in classic American fruits?

248
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:04,960
And that's from fruit salad fan in Winston-Salem. How does this happen?

249
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:08,240
How does this happen? That's so many different types of fruits you haven't eaten.

250
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:12,560
Do you think that maybe it's the kind of thing where like this person

251
00:22:12,560 --> 00:22:18,240
has actually had these fruits before and just like had no idea that that's what a pineapple is?

252
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:24,640
I mean, you're saying he ate a pineapple but didn't know it was a pineapple?

253
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:30,880
Oh, I'm saying like that he's had a fruit salad, that he's like had some like Hawaiian style pizza

254
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:35,840
and just never registered. Because here's the thing. I, after, let's say that this person is

255
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:42,320
30 years old. In 30 years of living in America, the odds that a pineapple has not accidentally

256
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:46,720
made its way into this person's gob- Has it infiltrated?

257
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:47,120
Right? Yeah.

258
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:50,560
Like the person has had it. Yeah.

259
00:22:50,560 --> 00:22:55,760
Yeah. My, I'm more offended by this person treating an object as exotic,

260
00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:59,600
which you can get on a pizza at Papa John's. Yes.

261
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:04,240
Like how, how dare you? It's not fucking 1658

262
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:08,480
and you just learned about this like mythical fruit from the new world.

263
00:23:09,040 --> 00:23:14,240
Yeah. And that's exactly the line of thing. Like, oh, we don't have pineapples in Illinois.

264
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:18,560
You mean the state where Chicago is? They wicked do have them there.

265
00:23:18,560 --> 00:23:22,640
Not just that. They do have them there. The state where grocery stores are.

266
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:26,960
Like pineapples are pretty much available year round in any grocery store.

267
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:33,280
You're right. My point was fallacious that they would only have pineapples in Chicago

268
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:38,320
and not in the rest of it. Yeah. You probably could get some in like Aurora, I would imagine.

269
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:43,920
And a peach and a pear. My dude, that's so many fruits.

270
00:23:43,920 --> 00:23:46,080
That's so many good fruits. A pear especially.

271
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:49,200
That pear is less and less exotic as you go down. Even a peach,

272
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:52,400
you could say, well, it's not the right temperature.

273
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:58,400
A pear is just a mellow, just smooth apple. That's all a pear is.

274
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:04,080
It's a mellow, flunky, smooth apple. It's a chill sort of apple with a fucked up shape.

275
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:08,560
What it is basically for a pear is it's basically a jazz apple.

276
00:24:08,560 --> 00:24:10,000
Yeah. If you think about it,

277
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:14,400
a pear is just an apple that's smoothed out and it's not going to have a bunch of bite,

278
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:17,680
a little softer chew. I could go for a bear right now.

279
00:24:17,680 --> 00:24:20,240
A peach is just a sassy fucking plum, isn't it?

280
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:23,200
Yeah. That's what I've always said.

281
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:27,360
Let me bite into this plum. The color is so bright and vibrant and it's a little bit tart.

282
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:30,960
Yeah, that's right. Watch out. I got a pit. Don't chip a tooth.

283
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:36,480
I don't understand how you see an object we call a pineapple.

284
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:42,480
You see someone slice it in half with a machete and then you are not immediately thinking,

285
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:44,480
I have got to savor what's inside of that.

286
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:49,600
I've got to eat that most appetizing inner meat.

287
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:57,040
If I were you, I would just set down a plate in front of this person with one slice of pineapple,

288
00:24:57,040 --> 00:25:00,880
one slice of peach, one slice of pear, and just stare at them and say,

289
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:02,320
eat it. Eat it.

290
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:08,320
And don't walk away until they do because you will never rest knowing that there's a human

291
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:14,960
being walking the face of this earth who has on purpose not ever had these fruits.

292
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:19,440
This is all you will think about from now until time immemorial if you don't resolve.

293
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:23,280
Maybe they were handed a whole pineapple and they thought, well,

294
00:25:23,280 --> 00:25:27,680
what am I supposed to do with this? There's no way. It's impossible.

295
00:25:27,680 --> 00:25:32,080
Look at the spines, the leaves. How do people eat these things?

296
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:35,040
I'm throwing this in the trash. Is that possible?

297
00:25:35,040 --> 00:25:44,400
Now, I'm thinking, boys, and I'm real worried that I have a similar gap in my food education.

298
00:25:45,280 --> 00:25:47,920
I'm worried. I'm thinking. I don't think I do.

299
00:25:47,920 --> 00:25:54,240
This thing mentioned papayas. We had a sick Roshana party last night and somebody brought

300
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:57,280
papayas and I didn't eat one. And now I'm thinking about it.

301
00:25:57,280 --> 00:26:00,480
Like, did I not eat one because I'm somehow afraid of papayas?

302
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:02,320
Because I don't think I've ever had one of those.

303
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:06,560
I don't think that's as, that's not as crazy, I don't think, as pineapple peach pear.

304
00:26:06,560 --> 00:26:12,720
But it's definitely not. Okay, here's, I'll tell you.

305
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:18,080
This is my general rule. If it is a fruit that the average person

306
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:24,240
standing in a supermarket would look at and be unable to identify just from seeing it

307
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:30,320
out and about in the world on TV and movies and such, then it is okay if you haven't tried it.

308
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:34,080
If you see that little yellow motherfucker that's all spiny and bumpy and you're like,

309
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:36,720
I don't know what this is, that's perfectly fine.

310
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:39,920
If you look at a pear and you're like, oh, what is this?

311
00:26:40,560 --> 00:26:43,040
What is this? Oh, what? Huh?

312
00:26:43,040 --> 00:26:48,480
Like, that's not okay. If you have to Google how to eat it,

313
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:51,680
then I don't think it's an issue if you have not tried it.

314
00:26:51,680 --> 00:26:55,680
But like, was this person watching SpongeBob SquarePants and he's like,

315
00:26:55,680 --> 00:26:57,520
what's this house made out of? I don't understand.

316
00:26:57,520 --> 00:27:00,560
What a fanciful cartoon. What a wonderful fantasy world

317
00:27:00,560 --> 00:27:03,440
that they've whipped up for us. What a spiny grass house

318
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:06,400
you've made for yourself, living sponge. That's a fun fake fruit.

319
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:10,000
What a wonderful imagination you have, Nickelodeon. What will they think of next?

320
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:17,440
I just don't, I don't, I don't understand how we get,

321
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:20,640
I don't understand how we get there. Pineapples is good as fuck.

322
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:24,160
Pineapples is the best fruit. That's the other thing,

323
00:27:24,160 --> 00:27:28,080
is that if I'm gonna eat like a big luscious chunk of fruit,

324
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:30,640
I always want it to be a pineapple. I always want it to be a pineapple.

325
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:34,560
Of course. Obviously. Obviously, of course.

326
00:27:34,560 --> 00:27:49,680
Clearly. This week's first sponsor is Club W.

327
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:52,640
Maybe you'd like to get deeper into wine,

328
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:55,280
but you don't know where to start. And I cannot think of a better way

329
00:27:55,280 --> 00:27:58,000
of doing it than Club W. You don't need to know about wine

330
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:01,280
to get the most out of this service. You're gonna log onto their website.

331
00:28:01,280 --> 00:28:07,440
You're gonna take a survey that explores your sort of taste preferences,

332
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:10,960
not what kind of wines you like, but what sort of flavors you like.

333
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:15,120
And they are going to match you with a perfect wine

334
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:19,200
that you will just adore. And right now, Club W is offering

335
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:23,680
our listeners $20 off your first order when you go to clubw.com

336
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:27,600
slash my brother. And not only that,

337
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:30,000
if you order- Will you get something else?

338
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,000
Does it get better? Thank you, Justin. For you

339
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:36,960
and for our listeners, yes. If you order four or more bottles of wine,

340
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:39,600
Club W is gonna pay for shipping. Hell yes.

341
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:41,360
Hell- What?

342
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:43,280
Yes. That's gotta be a misprint.

343
00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:45,520
No, you're right. Let me check it again.

344
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:48,640
Yep, no. Club W will pay for shipping on orders of four bottles.

345
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:50,080
It says it right there. That's wild.

346
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:53,360
It's right there in front of me. Four bottles of wine is heavy.

347
00:28:53,360 --> 00:28:55,840
That's like, that's a lot to ship. Thank you, Club W.

348
00:28:55,840 --> 00:28:57,440
That's very generous. They're at least 100 pounds.

349
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:59,600
Thank you. We don't deserve you, Club W.

350
00:29:00,560 --> 00:29:05,360
So take something off your to-do list. Go to clubw.com slash my brother

351
00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:10,480
and get $20 off your first order right now. That's clubw.com slash my brother.

352
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:13,840
I want to tell y'all about- Oh, oh, nope. You can't.

353
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:17,120
I'm going to. Okay, fine.

354
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:20,960
I want to tell y'all and all y'all about MeUndies.

355
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:25,200
MeUndies is underwear. And you wear it and it feels amazing.

356
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:26,640
Underwear, Griffin.

357
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:31,680
Under- Where is it? Where is it under?

358
00:29:31,680 --> 00:29:32,560
Jesus, please, no.

359
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:34,800
Is it under there?

360
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:37,600
Oh, man. Please. Please.

361
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:38,880
Please, Griffin.

362
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:41,520
Um, so here's the deal. You wear underwear every day.

363
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:44,160
At least most of us do. Time to try something better.

364
00:29:44,160 --> 00:29:47,280
MeUndies has created the world's most comfortable underwear.

365
00:29:47,280 --> 00:29:50,240
It's a blend of fabric that is three times softer than cotton.

366
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:59,040
I cannot stress enough how important it is that you swaddle your junk in stuff that feels very good.

367
00:29:59,040 --> 00:30:02,320
And then it's one of those investments that you don't think about being important,

368
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:06,960
but then you do it and you're like, this is the most important thing I've ever done.

369
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:12,160
Because it's like you're- You know how like there's some doctors or chiropractors that say like,

370
00:30:12,160 --> 00:30:17,440
your spine is the center of everything and if you have any health problems, it just comes back to your back being dumb.

371
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:23,040
I think the underwear stuff is the same thing. Like, oh man, I had a really hard day at work.

372
00:30:23,040 --> 00:30:32,480
Well, you wouldn't have if you had this awesome modal fabric just like, just hugging your stuff.

373
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:35,280
So anyway, get your stuff hugged.

374
00:30:35,280 --> 00:30:40,480
For a limited time, MeUndies is offering 20% off your first order at MeUndies.com slash My Brother.

375
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:44,800
If you don't love your first pair, it's free, but that's even a ridiculous thing to say.

376
00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:49,280
Just go to MeUndies.com slash My Brother, get 20% off your first order.

377
00:30:49,280 --> 00:30:51,680
Okay.

378
00:30:51,680 --> 00:30:53,280
Sure.

379
00:30:53,280 --> 00:30:57,840
I was talking to the audience, not so much to you guys, but I appreciate that you were dialed in there.

380
00:30:57,840 --> 00:31:01,200
I've got a question, I've got a message for Steven.

381
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:07,840
It's from Erica, parentheses, boo boo kitty, and it says the F word.

382
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:10,640
Say it Travis.

383
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:12,640
Boo boo kitty fuck.

384
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:15,600
Hi boo, happy birthday.

385
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:17,360
Time to gross out the internet.

386
00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:21,120
You're my boo tea-licious boo bear and boo berry pie.

387
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:24,800
You are my husband and best friend and I'm thankful for that every day.

388
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:28,400
P.S. I love Griffin, Justin, and Travis equally.

389
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:31,280
I also love Travis even more equally.

390
00:31:31,280 --> 00:31:33,760
And that message is for April 22nd.

391
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:35,600
Oh my God.

392
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:37,280
That's a rough one.

393
00:31:37,280 --> 00:31:40,880
That was six months ago.

394
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:43,440
That's rough.

395
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:45,360
We couldn't be worse on this one.

396
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:46,480
We really wang this one.

397
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:47,360
So anyway.

398
00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:53,280
We are actually just chronologically as far away from that day as we could on either side.

399
00:31:53,280 --> 00:31:55,360
Yes, it's rough stuff.

400
00:31:55,360 --> 00:32:02,640
That was, I think your instincts were right Erica, a pretty gross message.

401
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:05,840
I'm very happy for the love that you have with Steven.

402
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:07,120
For me, for Travis.

403
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:11,840
And also me and Justin and Travis, but also Travis more equally.

404
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:14,800
And happy birthday Steven.

405
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:16,080
Soon.

406
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:16,640
Soon.

407
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:18,880
Happy birthday, it's coming up.

408
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:25,200
I have a message here and it's from Elise and it's to Alex who says,

409
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:29,200
I'm not sure when this message will air, but instead of getting all uptight,

410
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:32,880
I think we should lean into it and change your birthday to the day the brothers read this.

411
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:36,320
May 28th was getting old and it was time for a birthday makeover.

412
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:40,800
Also, I thought you might like hearing, I love you little lek on your favorite podcast

413
00:32:40,800 --> 00:32:43,360
from your favorite brother, which I think is Justin.

414
00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:44,400
Anyway, happy 29th.

415
00:32:44,400 --> 00:32:45,920
I love you little lek.

416
00:32:45,920 --> 00:32:47,760
Anyway, happy 29th birthday lek.

417
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:50,880
Love Elise and cats.

418
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:56,160
So this one, I mean the birthday, May 28th, obviously we wang that a bit.

419
00:32:56,160 --> 00:32:59,760
The date that this message was aimed at was March 8th.

420
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:01,120
Holy shit.

421
00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:03,680
That's five months from now.

422
00:33:03,680 --> 00:33:05,520
We did great.

423
00:33:05,520 --> 00:33:06,480
We did great.

424
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:09,040
What happened to the, I feel like we've gotten a little bit better.

425
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:13,040
This week we really just really wanged it and donged it.

426
00:33:13,040 --> 00:33:16,160
We really just wanged it all over the place.

427
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:20,960
It was like the Jumbotron is our weekly time to feel bad about ourselves.

428
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:24,320
And like, you don't get that feeling like you let people down enough.

429
00:33:24,320 --> 00:33:27,440
We have it scheduled into our show to make ourselves feel that way.

430
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:30,480
So thank you for keeping us humble.

431
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:32,240
The great questions of your life.

432
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:34,560
The great questions of your life.

433
00:33:34,560 --> 00:33:36,240
Should you put ketchup on a hot dog?

434
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:38,000
Should you put ketchup on a hot dog?

435
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,480
Toilet paper over or under?

436
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:41,600
Toilet paper.

437
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:43,760
Star Wars or Star Trek?

438
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:45,120
Star Wars or Star Trek?

439
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:46,160
Fear not, my friends.

440
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:49,600
Mark and Hal always reach the definitive answer.

441
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:55,440
Simply listen to We Got This with Mark and Hal every Tuesday at 9 p.m. Pacific on Maximum Fun.

442
00:33:55,440 --> 00:33:56,560
We got this.

443
00:33:56,560 --> 00:33:58,960
Your better self is right around the corner.

444
00:33:58,960 --> 00:33:59,680
Namaste.

445
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:02,880
I got a Yahoo here and it's from Brooks Oglesby.

446
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:03,360
Thank you, Brooks.

447
00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:04,560
This is by Yahoo Answers user.

448
00:34:04,560 --> 00:34:05,680
Sorry, something's gone wrong.

449
00:34:05,680 --> 00:34:06,800
I'm going to call them.

450
00:34:10,080 --> 00:34:11,280
Leguizamo asks,

451
00:34:13,200 --> 00:34:18,400
what's a good Shaq-themed cocktail to mix for my New Year's Eve party tonight?

452
00:34:20,160 --> 00:34:24,800
What's a good Shaq-themed cocktail to mix for my New Year's Eve party tonight?

453
00:34:27,920 --> 00:34:30,960
What is a good Shaq-themed cocktail though?

454
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:33,440
What's just like a good...

455
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:34,320
Here's my...

456
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:35,680
I have a suggestion.

457
00:34:35,680 --> 00:34:36,880
Oh, I've got one.

458
00:34:36,880 --> 00:34:38,480
Okay, I'll do mine first.

459
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:40,320
Okay, just don't steal mine.

460
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:48,320
You just put whatever liquid in a very, very, very, very big wide glass.

461
00:34:49,200 --> 00:34:53,200
And then I think the glass, you have to, before anybody can drink it,

462
00:34:53,200 --> 00:34:59,360
you knock the whole glass over and it falls down and it spills because it's clumsy and goofy

463
00:34:59,360 --> 00:35:01,120
and everybody has a really good laugh.

464
00:35:01,120 --> 00:35:02,960
But you never actually drink the fluid inside.

465
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:06,080
You just spill it because it has like a funny tumble.

466
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:09,200
Strawberry Shaq-ery.

467
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:12,000
Maybe a Sazer Shaq.

468
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:15,440
So these are just...

469
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:20,240
Griffin, maybe instead of the super big glass, you go super tiny glass.

470
00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:27,920
So then you feel like how Shaq must feel when you have to interact with our everyday human objects.

471
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:30,560
Every time, I mean, that's essentially what a shot is, right?

472
00:35:30,560 --> 00:35:34,000
When you take a shot out of a shot glass, that's how Shaq drinks every liquid.

473
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:36,720
But before you drink it, you have to look at it

474
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:38,800
and just wonder why the world isn't made for you.

475
00:35:39,600 --> 00:35:42,000
Do you think Shaq and Andre ever met up?

476
00:35:43,360 --> 00:35:45,920
Do you think Shaq and Andre the Giant ever met up and were like,

477
00:35:47,360 --> 00:35:50,000
oh, it's nice to meet, this is really nice to meet you.

478
00:35:50,560 --> 00:35:52,320
I am also very big.

479
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:54,160
Yeah, I bet that they pout around a little bit.

480
00:35:54,160 --> 00:35:56,320
I don't know what the age difference is there.

481
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:59,200
They would try to walk into a room at the same time and break the doorframe.

482
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:00,800
Oh, that's really good and fun.

483
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:02,720
That's always so fun.

484
00:36:02,720 --> 00:36:05,040
And they'd like laugh and laugh and laugh.

485
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:07,200
All right, you guys repurposed other beverages

486
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:09,120
and just sort of squeezed the name Shaq into it.

487
00:36:09,120 --> 00:36:11,760
I want an original beverage that we can mix up

488
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:14,000
and then send to Shaq on Twitter and maybe he'll retweet it

489
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:17,280
because he's got like 11 billion followers and people love his stuff.

490
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:19,200
Okay, Griffin.

491
00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:21,760
I love Shaq.

492
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:24,800
People are still crazy about this guy.

493
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:26,320
That's what they should be.

494
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:29,600
He seems like a wonderful giant human being.

495
00:36:29,600 --> 00:36:29,840
Yes.

496
00:36:31,040 --> 00:36:33,280
Griffin, if I were to make a drink called,

497
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:34,800
and I want you to spin this off the dome,

498
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:35,840
I don't want you to overthink it.

499
00:36:35,840 --> 00:36:37,040
Hell yeah, dude.

500
00:36:37,040 --> 00:36:41,280
I'm kind of a mixologist, so just let him have it.

501
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:45,360
If I were gonna make a drink called the Kazam, what would I put in it?

502
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:49,200
First off, you start off with some nice champagne,

503
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:52,720
a Brut, something clear, bubbly and fun.

504
00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:56,640
And you fill a big, big, big, big, big mug with it, okay?

505
00:36:56,640 --> 00:36:58,240
Are you with me so far?

506
00:36:58,240 --> 00:37:00,400
And then what you're gonna do

507
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:03,520
is you're gonna throw a bunch of hamburgers into the cup

508
00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:06,240
and it's gonna displace most of the fluid,

509
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:08,400
but you gotta throw them from way up high,

510
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:10,240
recreating the famous scene in Kazam

511
00:37:10,240 --> 00:37:12,640
where the boy who gets the genie powers

512
00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:14,800
wishes for a fast food rain shower.

513
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:17,200
Hey boy, your wishes suck!

514
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:19,200
Your wishes suck, Kazam boy!

515
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:22,000
How did you do it that bad?

516
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:24,000
I want a credit card with infinite money on it

517
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:25,920
so I can go buy fast food whenever I want.

518
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:27,520
Nope, didn't have that thought, did you?

519
00:37:27,520 --> 00:37:31,040
No, the thought that you had was I want to litter the whole city

520
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:32,720
with French fries and burgers.

521
00:37:33,680 --> 00:37:36,080
Because who doesn't want to eat that off the ground?

522
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:41,520
And also, Public Works is gonna have a really, really bad month

523
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:43,200
trying to get all that stuff up.

524
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:46,000
And I also want to say that it's just a great example

525
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:48,000
of how little we're doing to educate our children

526
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:49,840
on proper wish making

527
00:37:49,840 --> 00:37:53,920
because this little motherfucker wishes for fast food to the sky.

528
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:57,760
Don't use idioms in your wishes, folks,

529
00:37:57,760 --> 00:37:59,600
because they will be taken littery,

530
00:37:59,600 --> 00:38:02,160
and you'll, like if you said, I want a million bucks,

531
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:03,760
you're gonna end up with a million deers.

532
00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:04,800
You know what I mean?

533
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:07,440
What do you think would go in a Kazam cocktail?

534
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:08,960
I'm so glad you asked that.

535
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:10,080
You drink it out of a lamp.

536
00:38:10,640 --> 00:38:11,520
Justin, are you okay?

537
00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:12,800
You sound like you're dying.

538
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:15,760
I got choked up, but listen, you drink it out of a lamp.

539
00:38:16,720 --> 00:38:17,680
Oh wait, I've got it.

540
00:38:17,680 --> 00:38:20,640
You put, just fill a lamp with Goldschlager

541
00:38:21,600 --> 00:38:24,240
because it's got the swirly like gold sparkles in there.

542
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:26,320
Oh, oh my God.

543
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:28,960
I know what you would do.

544
00:38:31,120 --> 00:38:34,160
I think this is a, you know how they make story cocktails?

545
00:38:34,160 --> 00:38:37,040
And these are cocktails that sort of evolve over time

546
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:42,480
and they evolve over time to like recreate the story of a film.

547
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:44,560
Do you guys know what I'm talking about?

548
00:38:44,560 --> 00:38:47,920
No, so this one would start off and it would be,

549
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:50,000
you know, I think Travis's instincts are right.

550
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:51,840
You put some Goldschlager in a lamp

551
00:38:51,840 --> 00:38:53,760
and you just drink that straight out of it.

552
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:57,280
But then a bartender comes by to change the drink,

553
00:38:57,280 --> 00:39:01,520
add more to the drink to further recreate the events of the movie Kazam.

554
00:39:01,520 --> 00:39:02,400
And you know what he does?

555
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:04,240
He fills that lamp up with gin.

556
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:10,640
And then he pours it onto a boom box, ruining the boom box.

557
00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:13,680
Well, that's not really,

558
00:39:13,680 --> 00:39:15,040
I mean, well, what he would need to do is-

559
00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:16,160
If that does happen in the movie,

560
00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:17,920
he transfers from a lamp to a boom box.

561
00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:19,200
Griffin, I'm not making this up whole plot.

562
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:20,560
No, no, no, no, no, I know that.

563
00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:22,320
I'm saying it wouldn't ruin the boom box.

564
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:25,120
We'd somehow need a boom box that when alcohol is poured on it,

565
00:39:25,120 --> 00:39:26,720
really, really good music comes out.

566
00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:33,440
What if you had to throw ice into the drink from the free throw line

567
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:34,560
and then you always missed?

568
00:39:35,840 --> 00:39:36,960
Justin's got a good point here.

569
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:39,040
We're focusing a lot on Kazam based stuff

570
00:39:39,040 --> 00:39:42,320
and I don't even think that's what Mr. O'Neill is like mostly known for.

571
00:39:42,320 --> 00:39:46,080
I do want to know, Justin, that was a sports pool there.

572
00:39:46,080 --> 00:39:47,600
You're not known for those.

573
00:39:47,600 --> 00:39:50,720
Did you just Google like funny things to know about Shaq?

574
00:39:51,360 --> 00:39:53,120
No, I don't know a lot about-

575
00:39:53,120 --> 00:39:55,120
That's one that just has sort of stuck in the crawl.

576
00:39:55,120 --> 00:39:56,960
I think because when I love something,

577
00:39:56,960 --> 00:40:00,000
I need to know its weakness should I ever need to destroy it.

578
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,400
And I love Shaq so much that I need to know

579
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:06,400
should I ever encounter him, where he's vulnerable so I can-

580
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:09,440
Hi, welcome to the My Brother, My Brother, Me Boss Strategy Guide here.

581
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:12,640
We're talking about fighting Shaq.

582
00:40:12,640 --> 00:40:14,400
The one thing to know if you ever fight,

583
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:17,600
like you're gonna need to get past the free throw line

584
00:40:17,600 --> 00:40:19,040
because he won't be able to get you there.

585
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:23,680
Yeah, so if I ever need to bring down Shaq, that's how I do it.

586
00:40:23,680 --> 00:40:25,600
I just bring up that little thing

587
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:26,960
and I bet no one's ever done it before.

588
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:28,960
Well, hold on, Justin.

589
00:40:29,840 --> 00:40:31,920
Aaron Carter did beat Shaq.

590
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:33,200
Yeah, that's a good point.

591
00:40:33,200 --> 00:40:35,200
That's another good weakness to bring up.

592
00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:38,720
Hey, Shaq, great commentating today.

593
00:40:38,720 --> 00:40:41,040
Remember when Aaron Carter beat you?

594
00:40:41,040 --> 00:40:44,000
At basketball, the whole song about how we did it.

595
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:45,840
That's weird.

596
00:40:45,840 --> 00:40:47,680
Hey, Shaq, can you break down for me

597
00:40:47,680 --> 00:40:49,840
sort of what happened on the court out there?

598
00:40:49,840 --> 00:40:52,400
I mean, obviously I've heard Aaron's version,

599
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:58,960
but I feel like it probably inflates Mr. Carter's talent on the court in song.

600
00:40:58,960 --> 00:41:02,160
I would love to hear from your giant perspective

601
00:41:02,160 --> 00:41:05,440
what happened out there and how you lost so bad to a small boy.

602
00:41:06,080 --> 00:41:07,360
Oh, well, thank you for asking.

603
00:41:07,360 --> 00:41:09,040
It's 100% accurate.

604
00:41:09,040 --> 00:41:10,560
That's exactly how it happens.

605
00:41:10,560 --> 00:41:12,560
I've never been more embarrassed in my life.

606
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:15,680
I would just like to say to Aaron Carter,

607
00:41:15,680 --> 00:41:17,360
how could you, how could you do this?

608
00:41:17,360 --> 00:41:20,160
We promised that we would keep the incident between us

609
00:41:20,160 --> 00:41:22,960
and then you wrote a hit song about it

610
00:41:22,960 --> 00:41:24,320
and I'll never forgive you.

611
00:41:24,320 --> 00:41:26,640
A hit docu-song.

612
00:41:26,640 --> 00:41:30,800
Does Shaquille O'Neal have a song called

613
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:34,320
How I Lost to Aaron Carter, the companion piece?

614
00:41:34,320 --> 00:41:37,920
How I Embarrassed Myself While Playing Against Aaron Carter.

615
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:41,040
And it's like, all right, listen, I had the flu.

616
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:42,800
I wasn't feeling good, how about you?

617
00:41:43,520 --> 00:41:45,520
My shoe was untied, I was really bummed.

618
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:51,040
I'm 100 feet tall, I hit my head on the moon and I fell over.

619
00:41:51,040 --> 00:41:54,080
I feel like it's more of like an eight minute long dirge

620
00:41:54,080 --> 00:41:56,080
that he co-wrote with Leonard Cohen.

621
00:41:56,640 --> 00:42:00,720
It's like, if Tower of Song was about basketball,

622
00:42:00,720 --> 00:42:04,640
like that is the song that I think that is like, he.

623
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:08,800
I knew it was time to get out of the basketball game.

624
00:42:09,840 --> 00:42:13,600
Little Aaron Carter really put me to b-ball shame.

625
00:42:13,600 --> 00:42:15,520
Like over and over again for eight minutes.

626
00:42:15,520 --> 00:42:18,240
Yeah, it had to be, I think it was probably

627
00:42:18,240 --> 00:42:21,440
a much closer game than Mr. Carter.

628
00:42:21,440 --> 00:42:23,440
You don't get a final tally, do you?

629
00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:24,480
You don't, no.

630
00:42:25,280 --> 00:42:26,560
I mean, Mr. Carter wants you to think

631
00:42:26,560 --> 00:42:29,040
that he obliterated Shaquille O'Neal.

632
00:42:29,040 --> 00:42:31,520
I just can't believe it, I just can't believe it's true.

633
00:42:31,520 --> 00:42:35,040
I think there was probably a series of circumstances

634
00:42:35,040 --> 00:42:39,040
that led to Shaquille O'Neal being at a handicap.

635
00:42:39,040 --> 00:42:41,440
Maybe in the room, the room had to be very low.

636
00:42:41,440 --> 00:42:43,520
I imagine it was probably not a regulation size

637
00:42:44,720 --> 00:42:46,640
basketball set up.

638
00:42:46,640 --> 00:42:48,480
And I think, I'll go ahead and say it,

639
00:42:48,480 --> 00:42:50,480
the ball was a bit deflated, wasn't it?

640
00:42:50,480 --> 00:42:52,320
So like Shaquille's usual dribbling techniques

641
00:42:52,320 --> 00:42:53,440
would leave him fumbling.

642
00:42:54,080 --> 00:42:56,720
And how do we even know it was the Shaquille O'Neal?

643
00:42:56,720 --> 00:42:58,560
This might've been a completely different Shaquille O'Neal.

644
00:42:58,560 --> 00:43:00,240
It could've been a different Shaquille O'Neal.

645
00:43:00,240 --> 00:43:01,200
Found at the supermarket.

646
00:43:01,200 --> 00:43:04,160
I'm saying, what proof does Aaron Carter have

647
00:43:04,880 --> 00:43:06,720
that it was the Shaquille O'Neal?

648
00:43:07,520 --> 00:43:08,000
Damn it.

649
00:43:08,640 --> 00:43:08,880
Yeah.

650
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:11,360
And also he had flubber.

651
00:43:13,040 --> 00:43:14,160
He probably had flubber.

652
00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:16,240
A lot of people don't know that.

653
00:43:17,760 --> 00:43:21,200
Shaquille O'Neal released five albums.

654
00:43:21,840 --> 00:43:23,680
Shaquille O'Neal has five musical albums.

655
00:43:24,640 --> 00:43:26,480
Shaquille O'Neal has four musical albums.

656
00:43:26,480 --> 00:43:28,960
The fifth one went unreleased.

657
00:43:28,960 --> 00:43:29,460
No.

658
00:43:30,560 --> 00:43:32,400
Shaquille O'Neal wrote an album called

659
00:43:32,400 --> 00:43:35,120
Shaquille O'Neal Presents His Super Friends Vol. 1.

660
00:43:36,240 --> 00:43:38,160
It was completed in 2001,

661
00:43:38,160 --> 00:43:41,360
intended to be the NBA superstar's fifth solo album.

662
00:43:41,360 --> 00:43:45,600
Producers include Rick Rock and Dr. Dre.

663
00:43:45,600 --> 00:43:49,040
It was slated to come out September 11th, 2001,

664
00:43:49,040 --> 00:43:52,320
but then it got pushed back to October 9th of the same year.

665
00:43:52,320 --> 00:43:54,880
After much delay, the album was abandoned completely

666
00:43:54,880 --> 00:43:56,000
and never released.

667
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:58,960
We have to break into the Disney vault and get it out.

668
00:43:58,960 --> 00:43:59,460
I need it.

669
00:44:00,160 --> 00:44:02,400
One thing that's messed up about the words

670
00:44:02,400 --> 00:44:03,360
in How I Beat-

671
00:44:03,360 --> 00:44:05,680
That's How I Beat Shaq by Aaron Carter.

672
00:44:05,680 --> 00:44:07,760
I want to just fast forward to the moment

673
00:44:08,640 --> 00:44:12,560
when the game really climaxed.

674
00:44:12,560 --> 00:44:13,760
Announcers were shocked.

675
00:44:13,760 --> 00:44:15,200
Couldn't believe it was real.

676
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:18,080
I can't believe a kid just stuffed O'Neal.

677
00:44:18,960 --> 00:44:21,280
One more second was all that remained.

678
00:44:21,920 --> 00:44:22,960
I put the ball up.

679
00:44:22,960 --> 00:44:25,120
I put him in shame.

680
00:44:25,120 --> 00:44:27,440
I must admit that sounds real crazy,

681
00:44:27,920 --> 00:44:29,040
but the ball went in,

682
00:44:29,920 --> 00:44:31,600
then he cried like a baby.

683
00:44:31,600 --> 00:44:33,600
I don't think that's necessary.

684
00:44:33,600 --> 00:44:35,760
Now you're just dragging Mr. O'Neal,

685
00:44:35,760 --> 00:44:37,120
and it's unnecessary.

686
00:44:37,120 --> 00:44:40,320
Also, it's okay if a grown man cries

687
00:44:40,320 --> 00:44:42,320
when he's beat by a 10-year-old at basketball.

688
00:44:42,320 --> 00:44:44,720
Aaron cried like a baby.

689
00:44:44,720 --> 00:44:46,560
That's so diminutive and judgmental.

690
00:44:46,560 --> 00:44:47,440
There's just no-

691
00:44:47,440 --> 00:44:50,720
First of all, Aaron, there's no fucking world

692
00:44:50,720 --> 00:44:52,240
in which you pull this off again.

693
00:44:52,240 --> 00:44:55,600
The series of crazy events that happened,

694
00:44:55,600 --> 00:44:58,880
there was like a solar flare and a deflated ball

695
00:44:58,880 --> 00:45:01,040
and Shaq had mono.

696
00:45:01,040 --> 00:45:02,960
Like, there's no way you could do this again.

697
00:45:02,960 --> 00:45:04,080
Not in a million, million years.

698
00:45:04,080 --> 00:45:05,280
Not in a million years.

699
00:45:05,280 --> 00:45:07,600
I hope you enjoyed that one time you beat Shaq.

700
00:45:09,040 --> 00:45:10,960
Hey, real quick.

701
00:45:11,600 --> 00:45:14,800
Shaquille O'Neal presents his Super Friends Volume 1.

702
00:45:14,800 --> 00:45:16,400
Just like to talk about some of the collaborators

703
00:45:16,400 --> 00:45:17,360
on this tracklist.

704
00:45:17,360 --> 00:45:21,760
Dr. Dre, Nate Dogg, Boys 2 Men, Twista,

705
00:45:21,760 --> 00:45:24,400
George Clinton, Snoop Dogg, The Roots,

706
00:45:25,200 --> 00:45:26,880
Ludacris, Black Star.

707
00:45:28,640 --> 00:45:31,600
This album could be the best album ever made.

708
00:45:31,600 --> 00:45:32,400
How do I get-

709
00:45:32,400 --> 00:45:32,960
You have to find it.

710
00:45:32,960 --> 00:45:35,040
I have to find Shaquille O'Neal presents

711
00:45:35,040 --> 00:45:36,560
his Super Friends Volume 1.

712
00:45:37,200 --> 00:45:39,600
Do you think every day Shaquille O'Neal opens the vault

713
00:45:39,600 --> 00:45:40,960
behind the picture,

714
00:45:40,960 --> 00:45:42,480
like behind the painting in his house,

715
00:45:42,480 --> 00:45:45,040
and he looks at the album and he's like,

716
00:45:45,040 --> 00:45:46,320
no, not yet.

717
00:45:46,320 --> 00:45:47,280
It's not ready yet.

718
00:45:47,280 --> 00:45:48,160
No one's ready for that.

719
00:45:48,160 --> 00:45:50,720
Mr. O'Neal, drop that shit on us.

720
00:45:50,720 --> 00:45:52,480
We are so ready.

721
00:45:53,520 --> 00:45:54,960
What if you're not though, Griffin?

722
00:45:54,960 --> 00:45:56,400
What if you fucking think you're ready,

723
00:45:56,400 --> 00:45:58,160
but then you hear it and your face melts

724
00:45:58,160 --> 00:46:00,080
like the guy in, you know,

725
00:46:00,880 --> 00:46:02,640
the arc, Raiders of the Lost Ark.

726
00:46:04,640 --> 00:46:05,200
I'm just saying.

727
00:46:06,240 --> 00:46:08,320
There's a world in which How I Beat Shaq

728
00:46:08,320 --> 00:46:10,640
is a really dark remake of the toy

729
00:46:10,640 --> 00:46:11,920
starring Richard Pryor.

730
00:46:12,480 --> 00:46:17,200
What if Aaron Carter's father paid Shaq

731
00:46:17,200 --> 00:46:19,360
an exorbitant amount of money

732
00:46:19,360 --> 00:46:21,440
to force him to lose at basketball

733
00:46:21,440 --> 00:46:22,320
to Aaron Carter?

734
00:46:24,320 --> 00:46:26,880
What if that is how it shook out, right?

735
00:46:26,880 --> 00:46:28,800
So the optics on it are not great

736
00:46:28,800 --> 00:46:31,520
for any of the parties involved, I'll consent,

737
00:46:31,520 --> 00:46:33,920
but what if that's how this played out?

738
00:46:33,920 --> 00:46:37,760
Like it was basically like a huge birthday present

739
00:46:37,760 --> 00:46:38,880
for Aaron Carter,

740
00:46:38,880 --> 00:46:41,200
and it was kind of a conspiracy theory.

741
00:46:41,200 --> 00:46:42,640
Like there's been a lot of coverup,

742
00:46:42,640 --> 00:46:44,160
but maybe that's how it shook out.

743
00:46:44,960 --> 00:46:45,840
Holy shit.

744
00:46:45,840 --> 00:46:47,680
That's, I mean, that is what happened.

745
00:46:47,680 --> 00:46:49,120
I don't think that's an alternate world.

746
00:46:49,120 --> 00:46:50,720
I think that is the subtext to that song.

747
00:46:50,720 --> 00:46:52,160
Has to be, has to be.

748
00:46:52,160 --> 00:46:53,760
Also, just one more thing I want to say

749
00:46:53,760 --> 00:46:55,040
before we move on from this topic.

750
00:46:55,040 --> 00:46:57,040
Oh no, I also have more things to say about this topic.

751
00:46:57,040 --> 00:46:58,480
We are not even close to moving on.

752
00:46:59,040 --> 00:47:00,160
Where's my rematch?

753
00:47:00,720 --> 00:47:03,760
Okay, I want this rematch.

754
00:47:03,760 --> 00:47:06,720
Aaron Carter should be in the prime of his life.

755
00:47:06,720 --> 00:47:09,120
He's gotta be what, 45 now, something?

756
00:47:09,120 --> 00:47:09,600
I don't know.

757
00:47:10,320 --> 00:47:12,800
Seems like this would be the time

758
00:47:12,800 --> 00:47:14,560
for him to compete against Shaq.

759
00:47:14,560 --> 00:47:16,320
Oh God, he's only 28 years old.

760
00:47:16,320 --> 00:47:17,760
What in the living fuck?

761
00:47:17,760 --> 00:47:20,640
Okay, so Aaron Carter, 28 years old,

762
00:47:20,640 --> 00:47:21,680
should be in his prime.

763
00:47:23,360 --> 00:47:25,200
Let's see, he's gonna be in DC

764
00:47:25,200 --> 00:47:27,120
at the Howard Theater, October 20th.

765
00:47:27,120 --> 00:47:27,920
Let's get it on.

766
00:47:28,480 --> 00:47:29,520
Shaq, get by there.

767
00:47:29,520 --> 00:47:31,280
Let's get this rematch going.

768
00:47:31,280 --> 00:47:35,040
Yes, I'll Google a nearby basketball zone

769
00:47:35,040 --> 00:47:37,040
and we will get this fucking thing going.

770
00:47:37,040 --> 00:47:38,560
Also, just want to bring up the track

771
00:47:38,560 --> 00:47:41,440
on Shaq Presents the Super Friends Volume One

772
00:47:42,160 --> 00:47:43,600
with Dr. Dre is called

773
00:47:43,600 --> 00:47:48,560
I Will Have My Revenge on the Blonde Child.

774
00:47:48,560 --> 00:47:49,840
And that's the opener.

775
00:47:49,840 --> 00:47:51,040
That's the first song is

776
00:47:51,040 --> 00:47:53,440
I Will Have My Revenge on the Blonde Child.

777
00:47:53,440 --> 00:47:56,560
So it looks like he's got one here with Will.i.am

778
00:47:56,560 --> 00:47:57,200
and it's called

779
00:47:57,200 --> 00:47:58,960
I Will Drink the Blonde Child's Blood

780
00:47:58,960 --> 00:48:00,640
Like Basketball Milk.

781
00:48:00,640 --> 00:48:02,560
That seems like a wild track.

782
00:48:03,280 --> 00:48:05,600
Little known fact, the reason that it was never released,

783
00:48:05,600 --> 00:48:08,640
Aaron Carter actually paid to buy the album

784
00:48:08,640 --> 00:48:11,360
so that it would never be heard by human ears.

785
00:48:11,360 --> 00:48:15,840
And that, my friends, is how he, in fact, did beat Shaq.

786
00:48:15,840 --> 00:48:17,440
He's been keeping it quiet.

787
00:48:17,440 --> 00:48:20,400
There's a song here with George Clinton and Snoop Dogg

788
00:48:20,400 --> 00:48:21,040
that's called

789
00:48:21,040 --> 00:48:22,480
On the Day of the Fateful Game

790
00:48:22,480 --> 00:48:24,320
I Had a Big and Powerful Sickness.

791
00:48:27,920 --> 00:48:29,360
I'm actually looking at this track list

792
00:48:29,360 --> 00:48:32,080
and every song on this album is sort of an explanation

793
00:48:32,080 --> 00:48:34,480
for why he lost the basketball game to Aaron Carter.

794
00:48:35,040 --> 00:48:36,240
By the way, I was just kidding.

795
00:48:36,240 --> 00:48:38,480
The song that he does with George Clinton and Snoop Dogg

796
00:48:38,480 --> 00:48:39,840
is Atomic Dog.

797
00:48:39,840 --> 00:48:41,840
Mr. O'Neil, one question.

798
00:48:42,480 --> 00:48:44,000
I don't think you can just do that.

799
00:48:45,280 --> 00:48:46,960
I like that Atomic Dogg song.

800
00:48:46,960 --> 00:48:48,240
I would like it on my album.

801
00:48:48,240 --> 00:48:50,080
Well, we already did it.

802
00:48:50,640 --> 00:48:51,120
Did it.

803
00:48:51,680 --> 00:48:53,760
I know, but I'm putting an album together

804
00:48:53,760 --> 00:48:55,920
and I would really, really like that song on it.

805
00:48:56,480 --> 00:48:58,480
Yeah, on my album this time.

806
00:48:58,480 --> 00:49:01,040
But me do, but I'll do it.

807
00:49:01,040 --> 00:49:02,080
But I'll do it.

808
00:49:02,080 --> 00:49:03,920
I'll be Snoop Dogg this time.

809
00:49:03,920 --> 00:49:05,440
Thank you so much for listening to our

810
00:49:07,840 --> 00:49:09,280
Shaq and Aaron Carter beef cast.

811
00:49:09,280 --> 00:49:10,640
My brother, my brother, and me.

812
00:49:10,640 --> 00:49:12,400
We hope you've enjoyed yourself.

813
00:49:12,400 --> 00:49:14,560
Unless you're Shaq, in which case I can imagine.

814
00:49:15,120 --> 00:49:17,120
This was a troubling episode.

815
00:49:17,120 --> 00:49:17,920
Or Aaron Carter.

816
00:49:17,920 --> 00:49:20,480
I feel like both of them didn't get out of it, okay?

817
00:49:20,480 --> 00:49:21,600
Yeah, sorry, it's kind of a short one.

818
00:49:21,600 --> 00:49:23,680
Travis has to leave to start a new life

819
00:49:23,680 --> 00:49:25,840
in the Queen City, Cincinnati.

820
00:49:27,120 --> 00:49:31,120
Safe travels, Travis, and good luck on your journey.

821
00:49:31,120 --> 00:49:31,840
Thank you, brother.

822
00:49:32,480 --> 00:49:33,040
Bon chance.

823
00:49:33,840 --> 00:49:36,560
I hope you've brought much smoked meat

824
00:49:36,560 --> 00:49:38,000
to sustain you on your voyage.

825
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:40,560
I have, I must go out and interview guides

826
00:49:40,560 --> 00:49:45,680
to lead me from this western Virginia county.

827
00:49:45,680 --> 00:49:47,120
Oh, you just take the double A up.

828
00:49:47,120 --> 00:49:47,920
It's not that hard.

829
00:49:47,920 --> 00:49:48,400
Oh, really?

830
00:49:48,400 --> 00:49:49,920
Yeah, it's gonna be easy.

831
00:49:49,920 --> 00:49:53,920
Okay, I was gonna take 52 and then disconnect with the 104-73.

832
00:49:53,920 --> 00:49:55,440
The double A takes like 15 minutes longer,

833
00:49:55,440 --> 00:49:57,520
but it's way prettier, like way more scenic.

834
00:49:57,520 --> 00:49:58,240
Oh, yeah?

835
00:49:58,240 --> 00:50:00,800
Yeah, but there's like no fast food, there's nothing.

836
00:50:00,800 --> 00:50:03,680
Yeah, gas up before, because like there's like nothing on it.

837
00:50:03,680 --> 00:50:07,760
Anyway, anyway, thank you, Travis,

838
00:50:07,760 --> 00:50:10,240
a sincere thank you to you all.

839
00:50:10,240 --> 00:50:13,280
First off, everybody who came out to Candle Nights,

840
00:50:13,280 --> 00:50:14,720
thank you, a huge thank you to you,

841
00:50:14,720 --> 00:50:16,880
and helping us to, not helping us,

842
00:50:16,880 --> 00:50:20,560
like just for us raising a bunch of money

843
00:50:20,560 --> 00:50:22,800
for Recovery Point and Addiction Recovery Center

844
00:50:22,800 --> 00:50:24,080
here in Huntington.

845
00:50:24,080 --> 00:50:26,720
So thank you so much for doing that

846
00:50:26,720 --> 00:50:28,960
and allowing us to serve as your conduits

847
00:50:28,960 --> 00:50:31,600
and making the trip to Huntington and everything.

848
00:50:32,400 --> 00:50:34,240
Everybody seemed to have a good time, so thank you.

849
00:50:34,240 --> 00:50:37,280
So, yeah, we are done with the TV show.

850
00:50:37,280 --> 00:50:39,680
I think this episode's also going up on Tuesday

851
00:50:40,480 --> 00:50:42,160
because we're recording it very, very late,

852
00:50:42,720 --> 00:50:45,280
but I promise we're gonna get back on a regular schedule

853
00:50:46,400 --> 00:50:48,640
and things are looking up.

854
00:50:48,640 --> 00:50:50,320
I feel like we open up this podcast

855
00:50:50,320 --> 00:50:52,320
by complaining about doing the TV show.

856
00:50:52,320 --> 00:50:54,000
Really, we're just complaining about doing work.

857
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:56,480
I think the TV show, I mean, I don't think,

858
00:50:56,480 --> 00:50:58,560
I know the TV show's gonna be great,

859
00:50:58,560 --> 00:51:00,560
and I really think you all are gonna love it,

860
00:51:01,760 --> 00:51:03,440
and I'm really excited for you to watch it.

861
00:51:03,440 --> 00:51:05,200
And I'm really excited for you to see it.

862
00:51:05,200 --> 00:51:08,080
And I don't know how many of them listen to this podcast,

863
00:51:08,080 --> 00:51:10,080
but I wanna thank everybody who helped out with it,

864
00:51:10,640 --> 00:51:12,880
not helped out, the people who actually made the TV show.

865
00:51:13,520 --> 00:51:15,440
Yeah, who let us be in the show.

866
00:51:15,440 --> 00:51:17,360
Who let us be in your television show you made.

867
00:51:17,360 --> 00:51:19,360
We really, really appreciate it.

868
00:51:19,360 --> 00:51:20,960
I wanna thank John Roderick and the Long Winters

869
00:51:20,960 --> 00:51:22,320

870
00:51:22,320 --> 00:51:23,440
off the album, Putting the Days to Bed.

871
00:51:23,440 --> 00:51:24,320
It's a really great album.

00:51:24,320 --> 00:51:26,240

It's popping off.

885
00:51:48,880 --> 00:51:52,240
It's been in like a constant state of off-popping

886
00:51:52,240 --> 00:51:53,920
for like the last year or so.

887

Thank you, Drew.

893

It's by Yahoo Answers user, Nathalia, who asks,

894
00:52:07,520 --> 00:52:09,760
where are the real Cuban sorcerers?

895
00:52:09,760 --> 00:52:11,920
Where are the real Cuban sorcerers?

896
00:52:14,480 --> 00:52:15,840
I'm Justin McElroy.

897
00:52:15,840 --> 00:52:17,280
I'm Travis McElroy.

898
00:52:17,280 --> 00:52:18,800
Where are the real Cuban sorcerers?

899
00:52:18,800 --> 00:52:19,920
This has been my brother, my brother.

900
00:52:19,920 --> 00:52:29,520
May kiss your dad square on the lips.

I'm Jesse.

I'm Jordan.

907
00:52:49,200 --> 00:52:52,400
And we've been doing Jordan Jesse Go for almost 10 years now.

908
00:52:52,400 --> 00:52:54,560
And it's not gotten any easier to describe.

909
00:52:54,560 --> 00:52:57,040
So we asked our fans to do it for us.

910
00:52:57,040 --> 00:53:01,440
Jordan Jesse Go is a weekly conversation with two best pals.

911
00:53:01,440 --> 00:53:02,720
Two hilarious friends.

912
00:53:02,720 --> 00:53:04,400
The hilarious smart kids.

913
00:53:04,400 --> 00:53:06,560
Talking about hilarious stuff that happens to them.

914
00:53:06,560 --> 00:53:08,320
Mostly really stupid stuff.

915
00:53:08,320 --> 00:53:12,400
Awkward and it goes insane tangents, heartfelt stuff.

916
00:53:12,400 --> 00:53:15,280
It's like being thrown in the middle of a hilarious conversation

917
00:53:15,280 --> 00:53:17,040
between you and your best pal.

918
00:53:17,040 --> 00:53:18,720
It's a show that makes me laugh every week,

919
00:53:18,720 --> 00:53:20,640
which is pretty rare and wonderful.

920
00:53:20,640 --> 00:53:22,640
Might be the best thing on the internet.

921
00:53:22,640 --> 00:53:24,880
One of the funniest things you will hear.

922
00:53:24,880 --> 00:53:26,560
And it's the best part of my week.

923
00:53:26,560 --> 00:53:29,040
And has kept me company for the past seven years

924
00:53:29,040 --> 00:53:30,560
through all sorts of life.

925
00:53:31,280 --> 00:53:32,640
I love those guys.
