1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,000
If you change your mind, I'm the first in line Honey, I'm still free, take your chance on me

2
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:19,000
If you need me, let me know, I'm gonna be around If you got no place to go when you're feeling down

3
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:28,000
If you're all alone, when the pretty birds have flown Honey, I'm still free, take your chance on me

4
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,000
If I do my very best, I'm an angel

5
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
That's it, step one, talk like Bill Clinton

6
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Maybe a fellatio goof

7
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:09,000
My fellow Americans, blow jobs

8
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Is that good? Is that a good impression?

9
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
You are gonna call that number

10
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,000
You will call that number and it will not be accidental, it will be drunk

11
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow, it'll maybe be a year from now

12
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:29,000
When you're real sad and lonely on Valentine's Day and you just call her at night and you go, hey, hey Debra

13
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,000
We haven't spoken in about a year

14
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,000
I thought we had something special together

15
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Oh man, the whole episode, huh?

16
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:42,000
This is former president Bill Clinton

17
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:48,000
I'm a ghost now, now I'm a ghost who loves blow jobs

18
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:53,000
I love blow jobs, balanced budgets and hauntings

19
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Griffin, yours sounds more like Don Nott's

20
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:00,000
The secret to Bill Clinton is you gotta sound like a ghost underneath a bunch of blankets

21
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
That's the secret

22
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,000
I love Bill Clinton

23
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,000
And if you felt a little undertaker in there

24
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Oh yes, it's me, former president Bill Clinton

25
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Blow jobs

26
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:22,000
We're like milk, we're zero scoops

27
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,000
We actually cool other people's love when they drink us

28
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Just to be in our presence kills other people's love

29
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Yeah, we're the opposite of love, whatever that is

30
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,000
They need to come up with an opposite of love

31
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:43,000
How about it, wordsmiths?

32
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Happy love

33
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Even with all your science, you still haven't been able to come up with a word that's the opposite of love

34
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Yeah, it's pretty despicable

35
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:00,000
You know, you think about Shakespeare

36
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Shakespeare created eyeball, he created the word puking

37
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Green-eyed monster

38
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Skim milk, obscene

39
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Luggage

40
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
That's all created by Shakespeare

41
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
He couldn't come up with the opposite of love

42
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Pinterest?

43
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
He did not

44
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:23,000
He did, he was talking about someone, I think it was in Two Gentlemen of Verona

45
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Where he says, her practicing her sartorial craft

46
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:33,000
She had a lot of Pinterest because she had a lot of interest in pins

47
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,000
And then the other gentleman of Verona responds

48
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:40,000
It's not that she loved her, he opposite of loved her

49
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:44,000
He did, he didn't

50
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Then he vomits and blacks out for six hours

51
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
It's his longest play

52
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
As a result

53
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:59,000
In lots of theaters they cut that, they trim it down to three hours of vomiting and blacking out

54
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Well you can usually just turn it into a dream ballet

55
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
That kind of conveys the time

56
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Or you do a War of the Roses kind of thing

57
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
You're like, hey buckle in audience

58
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Yeah, purists do the whole thing

59
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,000
This is a three hour song about social networking platforms

60
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:17,000
I am Barbacane the Tumbler

61
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Lord Steven of LiveJournal

62
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:26,000
I don't know what's happening

63
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:31,000
I would like to have been there on this day when this girlfriend asked this guy how much he loved her

64
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:34,000
And he responded, I don't know

65
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
I have to go to Yahoo Answers

66
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
A hundred?

67
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,000
I literally can't quantify it

68
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
How big is a house?

69
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:47,000
We have an opportunity here, not to equate it to another metric

70
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:50,000
But to come up with our own metric

71
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,000
That we can think about how much money we can make off of that

72
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:57,000
If we sold that shit to Hallmark and we just said like 50 billion

73
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Throbs

74
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Throbs is so good

75
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:06,000
I'm mad that we were going to have this whole riff and Travis just nailed it right out of the gate

76
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
It's throbs, obviously

77
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:12,000
It's sexual, but it's also heart related

78
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Okay, so zero throbs is just utter indifference

79
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:20,000
And negative throbs is that hatred or does hatred have its own

80
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Now what is hatred?

81
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
I'm sorry, I forgot the goof

82
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Hahahaha

83
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:35,000
I'm not even going to do your throb goof now because you ruined my goof

84
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Please don't take this out on the money making opportunity that we have in front of us

85
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Once a season I get a goof veto

86
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:48,000
And I'm using it to veto this goof as a punishment

87
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,000
For you unintentionally killing my goof

88
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:56,000
This is like a goof end of Reservoir Dogs

89
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Hahahaha

90
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Travis is cutting a goof ear off

91
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Just dancing

92
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Fuck

93
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Say your dumb thing about the throbs

94
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:15,000
My internal critic is Rupert Giles from Buffy the Vampire Slayer

95
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:19,000
And whenever I have no matter what entertainment or media I'm taking in

96
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:22,000
He's always disappointed in me

97
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
That's not a goof

98
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,000
I feel guilty all the time that I'm not reading books

99
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Hahahaha

100
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Sometimes for me it's Wanda, sometimes it's Maggie, sometimes they're together

101
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:38,000
I would watch that buddy comedy all day long

102
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
They made it, it's called Taxi

103
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Hahahaha

104
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
I don't have an internal critic

105
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Is that normal?

106
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
You have a lot of external ones

107
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Hahahaha

108
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
I get ballots

109
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
This one was sent in by Graham Wetterburn

110
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Thank you Graham

111
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
That's a good name Graham

112
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Yeah it's by Yahoo Answers user Raj who asks

113
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Why does Dilbert's tie curve up?

114
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Hahahaha

115
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Scott Adams said in an interview with groundreport.com

116
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
No one really knows, including me

117
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Dilbert started as a doodle before I knew he would be famous

118
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,000
I don't remember what I was thinking the day I decided to curl his tie up

119
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
WikiAnswers' search tells me

120
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:22,000
A. It's a metaphor for his inability to control his environment

121
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
B. He's just glad to see you

122
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:29,000
But IMO. A mini hurricane surrounds him and keeps flapping his tie

123
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:32,000
To all Dilbert fans, what do you think?

124
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Hahahaha

125
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Oh god

126
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Who thinks about Dilbert this much?

127
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Apparently not even Scott Adams can be troubled to figure out why his dumb tie is standing up

128
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:46,000
He's too busy hating women

129
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,000
When you ask the sexist creator of Dilbert

130
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Hey what's the deal with the tie?

131
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
He's like fuck it I don't know

132
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Stop pursuing that line of questioning

133
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Why is his tie sticking up?

134
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Cause she didn't cook it long enough

135
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Hahahaha

136
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
In the kitchen

137
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
I'm Scott Adams

138
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Why is his tie sticking up?

139
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Why are you not having kids?

140
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Get out of my face

141
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Scott Adams

142
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Hold on, I really think this Scott Adams character is going somewhere

143
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Why don't you workshop it and come back

144
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Hahahaha

145
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Justin's going to go workshop his Scott Adams character for a couple minutes

146
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Travis and I are going to goof on the original cue

147
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
But Justin's going to go off

148
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Hahahaha

149
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
You guys go forward and I will dip back in

150
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
In a little bit with some more Scott Adams

151
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Let me give you a setup

152
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
It's Scott Adams in a pet shop

153
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
That's run by a woman

154
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Good good

155
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Okay

156
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:46,000
I also like the person who ever said number two

157
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
He's just happy to see you

158
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Dilber's just got himself a tie bow in there

159
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Nothing weird

160
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
He's got a tie-rection

161
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:58,000
I think it's suggesting that Dilber is so bound to his job

162
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,000
That his tie has literally become a part of his body

163
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
And when blood flow increases to the tie

164
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
It forms a fully erect phallus

165
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
And he has a really curvy wiener

166
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Yeah

167
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Just like a hook, like a fish hook wiener

168
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
It's just a half chub

169
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:17,000
If it was a full chub, his tie would be sticking straight out from his neck

170
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Why are these poodles so expensive?

171
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Must be your time of the month

172
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Well, there he is

173
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Hey, Scott Adams, ladies and gentlemen

174
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Hey, what's next?

175
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
What's our next scenario?

176
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Scott Adams is an astronaut going to the moon with a female astronaut

177
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Okay, I'll check you out

178
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:41,000
This is the kind of question, right?

179
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
That somebody doesn't just ask

180
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Well, they did ask it

181
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
No, but I'm saying this isn't like

182
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Oh, it just popped in my head

183
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:52,000
They've stared at Dilber every Sunday

184
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Here's a few excerpts from my thesis

185
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
My master's thesis

186
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
What's the deal with Dilber?

187
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:02,000
I mean, there are a couple of answers from people who say

188
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Adams is also hinted that the tie may just be displaying an aversion to him

189
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:10,000
We may never truly know why Dilber's tie does what it does

190
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Dilber's tie doesn't do shit

191
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
It's not a real thing

192
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:17,000
A dude draws it and he doesn't know why he does it that way

193
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
There's no deeper truth

194
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
I just heard Justin inhale sharply

195
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
Which makes me think he's ready to give us his

196
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Scott Adams goes to the moon goof

197
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Why are you even coming, Angela?

198
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:30,000
The moon's made of green cheese, not malls

199
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Yeah

200
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
I'm Scott Adams

201
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
The first opus was a little stronger

202
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:40,000
And he's also starting to mutate a little bit into the Wolfman

203
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
Can I have one more?

204
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Oh, God

205
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
I need to redeem myself

206
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Scott Adams is getting married

207
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Okay, got it

208
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
DiabloAnswersUser? responded to me

209
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:55,000
I think that Dilber's tie curves up to give him some individuality

210
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:59,000
He works at one of those office settings where he is really just another number and paycheck

211
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
Nobody's special

212
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
He can be replaced at any time and nobody would notice

213
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
I think Dilber's tie makes him stand out

214
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Even though nobody really comments on it

215
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
Hey, I think you're projecting a little bit, bro

216
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Yeah, maybe just a touch

217
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:15,000
And maybe Dilber's there and Angela and accounting just doesn't want to talk to him

218
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
Even though he's a super nice guy and he offered to make her dinner

219
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
And that's why his tie curves up

220
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
It's hard, man

221
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
He just gets repressed by his triangular boss

222
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
And his dog talks

223
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
Which is pretty cool

224
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
His dog talks and his cat is like an evil scientist

225
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
I haven't read it in a while

226
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
But there's an intern or something

227
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
And they're real

228
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
Do you remember we used to have that Dilber screensaver?

229
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:41,000
Yeah, the Dilber desktop games

230
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
Man, when I was nine, that was a jam

231
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Yeah, we played some real dumb shit

232
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
Hey Justin, you got that goof ready for us?

233
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
For all that you are

234
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
And all that you will be

235
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
And all that we will be together

236
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
I do

237
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:59,000
Want you to get in the kitchen and make me some hamburger helper

238
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
I got it

239
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
Shit

240
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:09,000
Is this the first lie bowl we've ever done?

241
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
If you guys could adopt one celebrity

242
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
Who would it be?

243
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
Obviously, not Dilber Godfrey

244
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
He's going to keep you rolling, right?

245
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
With all the zingers

246
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
But I don't think that

247
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
The rest of it would make up for it

248
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
Ian McShane

249
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
Okay

250
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
What would Ian McShane be like, Travis?

251
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
Mostly he'd just shuffle around the house

252
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
In a bathrobe cursing

253
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
Sounds pretty good

254
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
Wouldn't that be awesome?

255
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
And just have friends over and be like

256
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
Don't mind my Ian McShane

257
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
Don't let him climb on your lap

258
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
Ian, down

259
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
Down

260
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
I'm going to go with Giamatti

261
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
Oh

262
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:55,000
I imagine him hiding up in the corner of the ceiling

263
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
And just spot him with a flashlight to get him down

264
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
Don't look at him, it's a challenge

265
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
Giamatti

266
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:07,000
Do you know what the problem with having a pet Giamatti is?

267
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
He's a Pokemon

268
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
It's Giamatti

269
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
Giamatti, go

270
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
You're so skittish

271
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
Go

272
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:21,000
Giamatti is the human equivalent of a comically large rabbit, I feel like

273
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
Oh crap

274
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
Justin

275
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
What?

276
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
You got a celeb?

277
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
I'm not going to adopt a celebrity to make any goddamn sense

278
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
They're people, they live in houses

279
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
They are human beings

280
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
I don't understand

281
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
I don't understand the question

282
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
And as requested

283
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
As promised, I should say

284
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
We have got a jingle

285
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
That is

286
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
Over a month in the making

287
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
Don't fucking talk about that

288
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:59,000
And it's been something Griffin has been sort of working on in his spare time

289
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
In his off hours in the basement

290
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
Five weeks

291
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
About 35 minutes of work on it

292
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
Yeah

293
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
Just hours of tinkering

294
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
He just wants

295
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
Sometimes he'll say, can I hear it?

296
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
And he'll be like, he's not ready

297
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
It sounds tinny

298
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
Bring up the speaker

299
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
It's got hand claps

300
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
It's got bass

301
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
It's got kazoo noises

302
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
It's got layering

303
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
It's going to be amazing

304
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
Here it is

305
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
Put your soap in my soap

306
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
And we'll both get clean together

307
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
Put your soap in my soap

308
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
Put your soap in my soap

309
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
It's got a divot for your pleasure

310
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
You gotta use that soap

311
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
Don't you waste your soap away

312
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
You gotta use that soap

313
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
Buy yourself some bars today

314
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
Yeah

315
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
Don't let your skin get dry

316
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
Stack soap, don't use no lye

317
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
Stack your soap into the sky

318
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
Buy yourself a little hope

319
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:35,000
A little hope with Stack Soap

320
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
Stack Soap

321
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
Get yourself clean

322
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
Buy yourself a part

323
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
That's where you'll find it

324
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:51,000
Get it on Kickstarter

325
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
It's going to smell so fresh

326
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
Soap

327
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
Wow

328
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
I hope I win the Grammy this year

329
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
for best soap song

330
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
Just to take things a little serious for a second

331
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,000
but not too serious because we'll come up the other end

332
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:19,000
The last time that we all went to Golden Corral

333
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:23,000
was the first Christmas Eve after our mother passed away

334
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:27,000
We decided that's the time we've got to get in there

335
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
and gnaw on the beef hooks

336
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
That's going to turn us around

337
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:35,000
We were like, we'll go out to dinner for Christmas

338
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
and didn't think of the fact that it's fucking Christmas

339
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:41,000
and everybody in their right mind is closed

340
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,000
Everybody's closed so there's one place that's open

341
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,000
Motherfucking Golden Corral

342
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:49,000
Well don't worry guys because it was the closest restaurant

343
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
to the cemetery we had just visited

344
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
Pretty good choice Golden Corral

345
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
How much does this restaurant cost to eat at?

346
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
Everything

347
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
Do you want to know the saddest part?

348
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
We weren't the only ones there

349
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
It was full of people getting their holiday nosh on

350
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:07,000
None of them were quite as in good spirits as us

351
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
Nobody made eye contact

352
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,000
Nobody made eye contact

353
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,000
You could tell the holiday magic was there

354
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,000
because a boy would come up to the beef hook

355
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
and a man would scoot over a little bit

356
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
Come on Junior

357
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
Come on

358
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
Get on in here

359
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
I've already gotten through the pre-gristle

360
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
Really tuck into the meat

361
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
All those boys over there

362
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
They just made a terrible life choice

363
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:35,000
They probably could have made spaghetti at home or something

364
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
Just slosh your sauce

365
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,000
and count your blessings

366
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:43,000
If I go to Italy and talk with an Italian accent

367
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
would I offend the Italians?

368
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:51,000
I'm going to Germany, Austria, and Italy May 23rd for 11 days

369
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,000
I just wanted to ask

370
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
I talk with an Italian accent but don't speak Italian

371
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:59,000
Would the Italians find that offensive?

372
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,000
I can't imagine

373
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,000
Why would they?

374
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,000
I think they'll find it flattering

375
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,000
They might think they're having a stroke

376
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,000
Why do I understand?

377
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,000
I don't understand what you're saying

378
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000
But it's Italian, it's got to be

379
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,000
It's got to be Italian

380
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
Look at you

381
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,000
He's an innovator

382
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
He's a pioneer of the Italian language

383
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
I don't understand any of it

384
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,000
You douchebag

385
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,000
This you doucher

386
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
This is either like

387
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
You either are planning on doing this

388
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
Which is bad

389
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
Or you already speak with an Italian accent

390
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
But you don't speak Italian

391
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,000
And your name is Kevin

392
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,000
So you're not from Italy originally

393
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
Do you know why people have accents?

394
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
Do you know how that happens?

395
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
Because they're from the place, Kevin

396
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
Jesus, Kevin

397
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
Kevin, you are from Nebraska

398
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
You speak with a Nebraska accent

399
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
A Nebraska brogue

400
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
I've never been to a foreign country

401
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
But I have to imagine

402
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
That it would be the same

403
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
As if anyone from Italy

404
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,000
Rolled up to America

405
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,000
And was like, now I'm going to speak with an American accent

406
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
Like

407
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
I don't hope for that

408
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
It wouldn't be a thing

409
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,000
It would be like, como esta

410
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
Mi amigo

411
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
Donde esta

412
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,000
La biblioteca

413
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,000
Donde esta la biblioteca

414
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,000
Biblioteca

415
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,000
Que tal

416
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,000
Mi amigo

417
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,000
I sound like the DNA strand

418
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,000
Yeah, you do

419
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
Dinosaurs

420
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
Mi amigo

421
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,000
De

422
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,000
Ñe

423
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,000
Es

424
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,000
Es tu amigo

425
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,000
Oh my

426
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,000
God

427
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,000
Donde esta

428
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,000
Thunder Lizard

429
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,000
Bien con migo

430
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,000
A Jurassic Park

431
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,000
Que es tu nombre

432
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,000
Mi nombre es

433
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,000
Jose Hammond

434
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,000
Que es la problema

435
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,000
Mi amigo

436
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:29,000
Tassara Tops

437
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,000
I wish I knew more Spanish

438
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,000
But I don't know any

439
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,000
I know how to ask for the library

440
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,000
Or maybe bookstore

441
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,000
I know how to say bathroom

442
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,000
And Mr. Ian Malcolm

443
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,000
Oh

444
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,000
Baby finds a wife

445
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,000
Es verdad

446
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,000
Christ

447
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,000
Yeah, oh god, don't do this

448
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,000
thing, Kevin

449
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,000
I have recently embarked on a year long

450
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,000
personal crusade to shed a bunch

451
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,000
of extra LBs

452
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,000
I've got a lot to lose, so I've broken it down

453
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,000
into 20 pound milestones, so I have goals

454
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,000
to plan against. And the first one is coming up

455
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,000
soon. In general

456
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,000
I fit the heavy set ponytail, bearded

457
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,000
nerd stereotype, so recently had

458
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,000
the idea I should probably mix it up at each 20 pound

459
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,000
milestone. Cut my hair, shave

460
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,000
my beard, start dressing a little nicer

461
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,000
Do you guys have any other ideas for potential

462
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,000
me changers, health

463
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,000
style or otherwise, that's trying

464
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,000
to rock it in Rochester

465
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,000
First of all, good on ya

466
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,000
Yeah, I love this question

467
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,000
so much I could faint. Getting it in 20

468
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,000
does. 20 does

469
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,000
you were getting it

470
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,000
I love the physical appearance

471
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,000
and caring about all that. Make sure that you're

472
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,000
taking care of your mental

473
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,000
self as well, so maybe on the next

474
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,000
milestone, you try

475
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,000
something, you know, food

476
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,000
or beverage related that you've never tried

477
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,000
before, something a little adventurous, and maybe you find

478
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,000
that you have a

479
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,000
great palette for wine, or

480
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,000
you really like Italian food, you know, something

481
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,000
new. Wait, hold the

482
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,000
fuck up, Travis. What are you

483
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,000
are you saying?

484
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,000
To reward yourself on this quest

485
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,000
to lose weight, what you should get

486
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,000
into is wine and

487
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,000
Italian food? Okay, let me strike

488
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,000
that. Oh yeah, I lost 60

489
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,000
pounds. Time to go to the OG and gain

490
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,000
it all back. What about

491
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,000
carb up and slurp down? I will have

492
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,000
all the fujule

493
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,000
Let me see all the fujule that you

494
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,000
got on your shelf. Well, just let me introduce

495
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,000
myself. I'm fat again

496
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,000
Then

497
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,000
can I say art?

498
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,000
Yes, not only

499
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,000
can you say art, you should have said art

500
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,000
the first time. I'm going to double back

501
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,000
and say art. You can't.

502
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,000
You can't. I can't. You guys

503
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,000
edit out your shit all the time.

504
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,000
He's

505
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,000
right about that.

506
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,000
He is not wrong. So let's say

507
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,000
rather than food and beverage, let's say culture

508
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,000
and maybe

509
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,000
go to a museum

510
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,000
or go to see a ballet

511
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:03,000
or go to see a symphony, something, you

512
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,000
know, that maybe you're not

513
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,000
normally into and you just want to check out and see

514
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,000
if maybe you dig it. You guys are thinking

515
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,000
so small scale.

516
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,000
I am

517
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,000
amazed at you. This guy

518
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,000
is offering us a chance. Every

519
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,000
20 pounds he loses, he can

520
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,000
totally and completely

521
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,000
reinvent his entire persona

522
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,000
so much so that

523
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,000
his friends won't recognize him.

524
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,000
You lose 20 pounds, cut your

525
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,000
hair, shave your beard, wear

526
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,000
sunglasses constantly, and

527
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,000
say your name is now Roz.

528
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,000
Lose another 20 pounds,

529
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,000
maybe you

530
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,000
go hit the tanning bed constantly

531
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,000
and you bleach your teeth

532
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,000
and then you change your name again to Brock.

533
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,000
Or the Brock.

534
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,000
Or the Mr. The Brock.

535
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,000
And then next time, you're going to

536
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:55,000
be really fit. Maybe get that asshole

537
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,000
bleached and let's see if we can't get a porn career

538
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,000
going. Lose 40 pounds, bleach that asshole,

539
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:01,000
regain 20.

540
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:03,000
Where are you at now?

541
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:05,000
Your friends don't know which side they're coming

542
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,000
from. Lose 40 pounds of fat,

543
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:09,000
regain 20 pounds of fuck

544
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:11,000
muscle. Get in there. What is

545
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,000
that?

546
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,000
It's what you

547
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:17,000
use to thrust. It's the

548
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,000
thrusters. It's your

549
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:21,000
thrusters. I just gotta get

550
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,000
your thrusters going and your afterburners.

551
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:25,000
I learned these.

552
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:27,000
I'm going to take you to hyperspace.

553
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,000
Try a barrel roll.

554
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,000
It's bad news.

555
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,000
Our shields are failing.

556
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,000
Girl, girl.

557
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:37,000
Fire up the tachyon cannons.

558
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:43,000
Oh man. I need some

559
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:45,000
more dilithium crystals, by which I mean

560
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:47,000
meth. Of course in that case

561
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:49,000
it would be fuck meth. Because it's the meth

562
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:51,000
that you use for sex.

563
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:53,000
I learned in school that

564
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:55,000
every muscle is a fuck muscle or you're just not

565
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:57,000
doing it right.

566
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,000
What class was that in?

567
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:01,000
What school were you going to?

568
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:03,000
Health school.

569
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:05,000
You dummy.

570
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:07,000
I saw an episode of Morrie recently

571
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:09,000
where Morrie likes to cure people of their fears

572
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:11,000
by something Morrie believes in called immersion therapy.

573
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:13,000
Where he

574
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:15,000
is like, I know you're afraid of band-aids.

575
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,000
We're covering you with band-aids.

576
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:19,000
Wake up. You've been covered with band-aids

577
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:21,000
this whole time. There was a lady

578
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:23,000
who was afraid. Her big

579
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:25,000
fear? Tigers.

580
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:27,000
And Morrie brought a tiger.

581
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:29,000
That's a perfectly reasonable fear.

582
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:31,000
Can we all keep our fear of tigers?

583
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:33,000
Can we not be afraid

584
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:35,000
of tigers? That seems like a super

585
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:37,000
good one.

586
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:39,000
Deborah, just keep in mind that the tiger

587
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:41,000
is just as afraid of you as you

588
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:43,000
are of it. Oh, no. It wasn't.

589
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:45,000
Sorry, you're dead.

590
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:47,000
They're acting like it's a problem

591
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:49,000
because I can't even look at

592
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:51,000
Frosted Flakes. Don't get Frosted Flakes.

593
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:53,000
Don't go to Frosted Flakes.

594
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:55,000
Get the off-brand

595
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:57,000
toasted flakes.

596
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:59,000
And don't go to Exxon.

597
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:01,000
I think that's pretty much it, right?

598
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:03,000
Don't go to any Bengals games.

599
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:05,000
My day-to-day exposure to

600
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:07,000
tigers is actually pretty low.

601
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:09,000
I don't have to see a

602
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,000
tiger if I don't want to. You know what?

603
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:13,000
Thinking about that, mine might be a little bit too low.

604
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:23,000
I'm not sure I'm getting enough vitamin T.

605
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:25,000
Everybody's got some

606
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,000
needs, and

607
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:29,000
everybody's got some wants.

608
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:31,000
Extreme

609
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:33,000
Restraints' catalog of sexual

610
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:35,000
products will fulfill both of those

611
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:37,000
things for you.

612
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:39,000
So visit extremerestraints.com

613
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:41,000
and

614
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:43,000
get

615
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:45,000
an electroshock paddle that goes

616
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:47,000
on your balls.

617
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:49,000
Is that a real thing?

618
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,000
It should be.

619
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:53,000
I'm

620
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:55,000
going to request that you put a real product

621
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:57,000
in there.

622
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:59,000
Go to extremerestraints.com

623
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:03,000
and buy a ghost

624
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:05,000
that you can fuck every night.

625
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:07,000
That's

626
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:09,000
not a thing. We need a site

627
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:11,000
called Extreme Restraints.

628
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:13,000
Go to extremerestraints.com

629
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:17,000
and buy a sexual

630
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:19,000
fish tank.

631
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:21,000
You're

632
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:23,000
doing an ad for

633
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:25,000
extremerestraints.com.

634
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:27,000
Go to extremerestraints.com

635
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:29,000
and learn about all the good chicken

636
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:31,000
Popeye recipes

637
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:33,000
on the forums.

638
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:35,000
Holy

639
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:37,000
inaccurate. Everything you're saying right

640
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:39,000
now is a bastardization of this product message.

641
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:41,000
This is by Yahoo Answers

642
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:43,000
user marymaryx30

643
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:45,000
who asks,

644
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:47,000
how do I improve my scorpions?

645
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,000
My

646
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,000
scorpions are okay, but not the best.

647
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:53,000
How do I improve them? I've been

648
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:55,000
struggling with them for months.

649
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:57,000
That's it?

650
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:59,000
That's so important. That's the context?

651
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:01,000
Best at what?

652
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:03,000
By the way, when I said that it was related

653
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:05,000
I meant completely

654
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:07,000
diametrically. Best in what

655
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:09,000
capacity? With scorpions

656
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:11,000
you have four basic

657
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:13,000
criteria for

658
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:15,000
judging their quality.

659
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:17,000
It's their four danger zones, right?

660
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:19,000
Yeah, the four danger zones you've got to worry

661
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:21,000
about. One, exoskeleton.

662
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:23,000
Yes.

663
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:25,000
What kind of chitin is he working

664
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:27,000
with? Can we improve it?

665
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:29,000
How's your chitin? Is he getting enough vitamin D?

666
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:31,000
That's huge for chitin.

667
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:33,000
D is, I say, I've

668
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:35,000
always said that. What's that motto

669
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:37,000
you always tell people and you have it

670
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:39,000
cross-stitched up on the

671
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:41,000
hanging up there in the den above the fireplace?

672
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:43,000
What is it?

673
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:45,000
It's

674
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:47,000
you gotta have D

675
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:49,000
if you want

676
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:51,000
if you don't

677
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:53,000
don't shed your

678
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:55,000
don't shed

679
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:57,000
that chitin.

680
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:59,000
Fuck!

681
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:01,000
It took

682
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:03,000
it took our mom weeks to stitch

683
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:05,000
exactly that, but Griffin

684
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:07,000
was very... And she was not a

685
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:09,000
swearing woman. Yeah, she did not

686
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:11,000
enjoy swearing, but Griffin was very

687
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:13,000
specific. So armor.

688
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:15,000
Armor, that's number one.

689
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:17,000
Second, of course, claws.

690
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:19,000
Does it look like a little

691
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:21,000
crab? Do I know if scorpions

692
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:23,000
have claws? How are the

693
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:25,000
pincers? How are the pincers?

694
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:27,000
Number three,

695
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:29,000
obviously,

696
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:31,000
pointy tail.

697
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:33,000
What's in there?

698
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:35,000
Who knows? Caramel?

699
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:37,000
Poison?

700
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:39,000
I injected some caramel into all your treats.

701
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:41,000
I'm the best scorpion ever.

702
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:43,000
And then what's the fourth

703
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:45,000
one? Heat coming off the genitals.

704
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:47,000
How is its

705
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:49,000
genital heat? Also, can you find my

706
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:51,000
scorpion's genitals for me?

707
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:53,000
Can I make a 1980s movie called

708
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:55,000
Genital Heat? I've been over this

709
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:57,000
motherfucker's thorax with a fine tooth comb.

710
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:59,000
No genitals to be found.

711
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:01,000
If you see a scorpion in your

712
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:03,000
house, your very

713
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:05,000
next stop is

714
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:07,000
an open house.

715
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:09,000
Century 21.

716
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:11,000
Pardon me.

717
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:13,000
This is a lovely open

718
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:15,000
house. Thank you for having me. I'll take it.

719
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:17,000
I cannot sell my old

720
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:19,000
house because the scorpion lives there now.

721
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:21,000
It's his now.

722
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:23,000
I'm gonna try to charge him taxes

723
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:25,000
on the sale, but

724
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:27,000
I don't know how- scorpions don't have money.

725
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:29,000
Can we improve the

726
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:31,000
mass marketability of these scorpions?

727
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:33,000
You guys are missing the obvious

728
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:35,000
answer. What? What's that, Travis?

729
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:37,000
Steroids. Travis, I don't

730
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:39,000
think that- Wait.

731
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:41,000
You're running away from me because you want to make these

732
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:43,000
scorpions, like, super

733
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:45,000
beefy? I don't know that they have

734
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:47,000
beef. Right.

735
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:49,000
I don't know that they have beef to

736
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:51,000
embiffen, you know? I think it's just

737
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:53,000
just skittering- Well, not yet.

738
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:55,000
Skittering claws? You gotta get them on

739
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:57,000
a regime. It's all

740
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:59,000
chitin and- On a regimen.

741
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:01,000
It's chitin and just hate in there.

742
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:03,000
Maybe you could paint their

743
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:05,000
shells like hermit crabs.

744
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:07,000
See, I like that. Paint the scorpion

745
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:09,000
for kids.

746
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,000
This is what I'm talking about.

747
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:13,000
Can we make scorpions

748
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:15,000
the new Furbies?

749
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:17,000
Of course. Just a tiny

750
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:19,000
cork on their stingers.

751
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:21,000
That would be adorable.

752
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:23,000
And rubber bands

753
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:25,000
on their claws.

754
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:27,000
I think scorpions are so hateful that

755
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:29,000
if you cork their tails and

756
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:31,000
rubber banded their claws, that they'd, like,

757
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:33,000
learn to bite.

758
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:35,000
Yeah, they'll grow fangs. Or learn how to use a gun.

759
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:37,000
Or just become really spiteful.

760
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:39,000
Use their words to hurt you.

761
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:41,000
Looking fat today, J-Man.

762
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:43,000
Hair's looking a little

763
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:45,000
thin.

764
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:47,000
Not as young as you used to be,

765
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:49,000
J-Man. So he turns into

766
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:51,000
little juice.

767
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:53,000
It's an old parable. It's an old story

768
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:55,000
of the frog and the scorpion.

769
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:57,000
The frog gives the scorpion a ride across

770
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:59,000
the river, and halfway across,

771
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:01,000
the scorpion starts calling him, I don't know,

772
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:03,000
stupid and stuff. And the frog starts crying.

773
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:05,000
He's like, why are you such an asshole?

774
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:07,000
And the scorpion's like, it's in my nature!

775
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:09,000
But then does he sting him?

776
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:11,000
No.

777
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:13,000
Because he's got a tiny cork on his tail.

778
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:15,000
He just batters him with the cork.

779
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:17,000
He's like, you like that? Ow!

780
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:19,000
New line of frog-safe scorpions.

781
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:21,000
Each one is $20.

782
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:23,000
Who is the first to buy?

783
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:25,000
God, can you imagine

784
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:27,000
a frog with a scorpion on its

785
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:29,000
back, and the frog is also

786
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:31,000
full of hate? And then like,

787
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:33,000
you get that lethality

788
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:35,000
of a scorpion with the mobility of a frog?

789
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:37,000
Well,

790
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:39,000
we're done. Oh, shit. And the frog

791
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:41,000
is secreting some sort of hallucinogen.

792
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:43,000
So the scorpion is just

793
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:45,000
freaked out.

794
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:47,000
The frog has a really high credit score,

795
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:49,000
so he's able to like, get a house.

796
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:51,000
Why would that be a thing?

797
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:53,000
Why would that be a thing?

798
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:55,000
And one of them is played by Ray Romano.

799
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:57,000
Oh my god, the frog is Ray Romano.

800
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:59,000
Ugh.

801
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:01,000
Oh, and the scorpion's played by Tim Allen.

802
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:03,000
We've got a hit! Listen, this has been

803
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:05,000
the least productive

804
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:07,000
meeting we've had about Madagascar 4 yet.

805
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:09,000
And I think we need

806
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:11,000
to go back to the drawing board

807
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:13,000
and really see where we went astray.

808
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:15,000
We have a theory that it's when we introduce

809
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:17,000
scorpions.

810
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:19,000
They ruin everything, including

811
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:21,000
our Madagascar 4 production meetings.

812
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:25,000
I'm reading more of this Yahoo answer,

813
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:27,000
and I think that a scorpion is a yoga position.

814
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:29,000
Oh.

815
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:31,000
Moving on.

816
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:39,000
None of that was helpful to this person.

817
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:41,000
You don't know.

818
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:43,000
You throw it at the wall, you see what it takes.

819
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:45,000
They might have found something in there that was useful.

820
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:47,000
Here's what it takes. Scorpions.

821
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:49,000
Their feet are like needles.

822
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:51,000
Hey, brothers.

823
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:53,000
There's someone

824
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:55,000
really into yoga

825
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:57,000
that's been screaming at their iPod

826
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:59,000
for five minutes.

827
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:01,000
You dumb motherfuckers!

828
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:05,000
I'm not saying like, lying like

829
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:07,000
I'm not.

830
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:09,000
I've got a real hearty penis.

831
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:11,000
No, I'm not.

832
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:13,000
I'm not talking about lying like...

833
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:15,000
It's like a can of Senka down there.

834
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:17,000
He's talking about lying like saying things like

835
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:19,000
no, I'm not afraid of masks.

836
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:21,000
Yeah, right. Pretending like I'm not afraid

837
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:23,000
of the robot woman from Superman 3.

838
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:25,000
Should that come up in casual conversations.

839
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:27,000
Oh, you know who I like?

840
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:31,000
You know what never scared me?

841
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:33,000
The HBO logo they used to show

842
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:35,000
for the movies in the 80s.

843
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:37,000
It never really scared me.

844
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:39,000
You're the ever loving shit out of you.

845
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:41,000
No big deal. It was pretty frightening.

846
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:43,000
Hey, y'all. Thanks for

847
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:45,000
listening to our Best Of episode.

848
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:47,000
As you all

849
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:49,000
might have guessed, if you

850
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:51,000
follow us on other social channels, there's

851
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:53,000
a good reason for why we don't have a regular

852
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:55,000
episode out this week and that is

853
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:57,000
that Vine is shutting down

854
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:59,000
and I'm just really struggling with it.

855
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:01,000
Yeah, that's the story of the week

856
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:03,000
and Vine...

857
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:05,000
I miss it so much.

858
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:07,000
I miss it so much. I learned so many

859
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:09,000
valuable lessons from it but now it's just like

860
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:11,000
what's the... like comedy is dead

861
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:13,000
kind of. Yeah, comedy's

862
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:15,000
over. I miss

863
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:17,000
it so much because you know what was nice about it?

864
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:19,000
It was easy. It was so easy.

865
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:21,000
Six seconds, one and done.

866
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:23,000
One good

867
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:25,000
toot. Yep.

868
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:27,000
And that's a viral baby.

869
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:29,000
It's viral content.

870
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:31,000
No, the real reason why we don't have an episode this...

871
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:33,000
Oh, we do have an episode this week but not a normie.

872
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:35,000
Is that

873
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:37,000
Travis and Teresa had a baby.

874
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:39,000
What? Yeah, I'm...

875
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:41,000
Oh, you're not just finding this out, are you Justin?

876
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:43,000
No, I knew that. It was just a little joke for the show.

877
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:45,000
See, and that joke was the perfect length

878
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:47,000
of time to go into Vine.

879
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:49,000
Yes, both

880
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:51,000
baby and mama are doing well.

881
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:53,000
It is a girl.

882
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:55,000
These are all things that Travis said I was allowed to announce

883
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:57,000
on the show, which is very exciting.

884
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:59,000
Her name is Bebe.

885
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:01,000
Barbara Lee McElroy and we are

886
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:03,000
so, so, so happy for Travis and Teresa.

887
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:05,000
And so we're doing this special

888
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:07,000
episode. I guess another programming note,

889
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:09,000
that Casper special that we were

890
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:11,000
talking about doing is going to be not

891
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:13,000
on Halloween, because that's today.

892
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:15,000
Yeah. But we're going to figure this out

893
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:17,000
sort of as

894
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:19,000
we go. So we ask for your patience

895
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:21,000
and we're going to keep churning out the content

896
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:23,000
for you. And

897
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:25,000
again, congratulations to Travis and Teresa.

898
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:27,000
And

899
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:29,000
I guess my condolences to myself.

900
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:31,000
Yep.

901
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:33,000
Is this before the show or is this

902
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:35,000
in the middle of the show? No, this will be in the middle. Okay, great.

903
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:37,000
Well, that means that we're in the middle of

904
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:39,000
the money zone and it's time to

905
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:41,000
go there

906
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:43,000
and be there. Are we there? Dude, I've

907
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:45,000
been there for the past two minutes. Like I've been getting

908
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:47,000
paid this whole time talking about Vine going down

909
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:49,000
and my new great niece.

910
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:51,000
Well, that is a, well, she's just

911
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:53,000
your niece. No, but she's great

912
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:55,000
though. She's not. Okay.

913
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:57,000
This is the perfect opportunity for me to tell you about

914
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:59,000
a bowl and branch. Getting a great night's sleep

915
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:01,000
is easier and more affordable than you might think.

916
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:03,000
Griffin, you don't need a new

917
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:05,000
expensive mattress or sleeping pills.

918
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:07,000
You need to change your sheets.

919
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:09,000
Think about it. What's wrong with mine?

920
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:11,000
That's what your skin is touching.

921
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:13,000
These are a bowl and branch

922
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:15,000
means luxury linens and

923
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:17,000
you're not paying anything. And like what language does

924
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:19,000
that translate to luxury? Just

925
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:21,000
language of brand.

926
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:23,000
These are wonderful sheets.

927
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:25,000
Luxury sheets can cost $20,000

928
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:27,000
I bet, but

929
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:29,000
in a store. But bowl and branch are not

930
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:31,000
going to cost that. Not even close. They're like a

931
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:33,000
couple hundred bucks. They'll let you try them

932
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:35,000
risk free for 30 nights. And if you don't love them, you

933
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:37,000
can send them back for a full refund. That's

934
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:39,000
right. You have nothing to lose

935
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:41,000
and they come beautifully packaged

936
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:43,000
in signature boxes that make you feel like

937
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:45,000
a proper little fancy

938
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:47,000
person. Also, these sheets

939
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:49,000
can't be torn up.

940
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:51,000
They can't be burned. They're indestructible.

941
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:53,000
They are indestructible. They are the

942
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:55,000
golden fleece. They're

943
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:57,000
all made of golden fleece. So when you sleep

944
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:59,000
on them, every night that you sleep on them, your

945
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:01,000
life expectancy increases by one year.

946
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:03,000
Just to keep that bowl and branch

947
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:05,000
executive list of this from jumping out the window,

948
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:07,000
I should mention that no, these are not indestructible

949
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:09,000
sheets. They're just regular

950
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:11,000
levels of destructibility.

951
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:13,000
We have to say that.

952
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:15,000
They're not like more destructible.

953
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:17,000
Yeah, legally we have to say that, but

954
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:19,000
you guys know.

955
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:21,000
You all know what's up.

956
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:23,000
Bowl and branch is going to give you $50 off

957
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:25,000

twice as long, go twice as hard.

965
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:41,000
Alright, you do yours now and I'm going to

966
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:43,000
throw shade at you the whole time. I'm not

967
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:45,000
throwing shade. I was a hype

968
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:47,000
man for this product. That's all we're doing here in the

969
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:49,000
money zone. I want to tell all y'all

970
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:51,000
about Wink. I know you're hearing that

971
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:53,000
thinking, who's this new customer?

972
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:55,000
I don't trust them. Yes, you do trust them

973
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:57,000
because it's Club W.

974
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:59,000
They've evolved. Somebody

975
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:01,000
used the

976
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:03,000
leaf stone on Club W

977
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:05,000
and they've evolved into Wink.

978
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:07,000
Amazing. Wink is

979
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:09,000
well, it's a lot like Club W.

980
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:11,000
They are going to help you

981
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:13,000
find the wine that is going to be

982
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:15,000
personalized to your palate. They're going to deliver

983
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:17,000
it right to your door.

984
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:19,000
It's called Wink now and that's spelled

985
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:21,000
W-I-N-C.

986
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:23,000
I know you hear that and you think

987
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:25,000
that's not the normal way

988
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:27,000
it's normally spelled. Well, no.

989
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:29,000
It's a new name. It's an improved look.

990
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:31,000
Here's the important part. Still the same

991
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:33,000
amazing wine company introducing you to

992
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:35,000
wines that you're going to love.

993
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:37,000
Fantastic.

994
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:39,000
Tell me more. I will.

995
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:41,000
Just calm down. I'm kind of flying by the seat of my pants

996
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:43,000
right now. Everything has changed.

997
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:45,000
My whole world has changed. Vine is gone.

998
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:47,000
I've got a second niece. I've got

999
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:49,000
two nieces now and you guys didn't even think about

1000
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:51,000
how hard that's going to be for me to keep straight.

1001
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:53,000
Now Club W is called Wink.

1002
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:55,000
It's not spelled with a K. It's spelled with a C.

1003
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:57,000
That's great. I just need

1004
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:59,000
a minute. Okay? Okay.

1005
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:01,000
Take your time. Wink.

1006
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:03,000
They work directly with winemakers

1007
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:05,000
and growers from all over the world to create delicious

1008
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:07,000
wine and they deliver it right to your door.

1009
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:09,000
They have 100% satisfaction

1010
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:11,000
guarantee which means if you don't like a bottle they send you

1011
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:13,000
they will replace it with a bottle that you're going to love

1012
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:15,000
no questions asked. And that means

1013
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:17,000
questions like but you drank the whole bottle

1014
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:19,000
and you stuck a note inside that said yum yum

1015
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:21,000
I sure love this.

1016
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:23,000
We're not going to ask that question. We're not going to

1017
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:25,000
ask you about that. We're just going to send you another bottle

1018
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:27,000
no questions asked. Whoa.

1019
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:29,000

00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:59,000
moment to

1035
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:01,000
mention to you

1036
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:03,000
about a new podcast. It's called Driving Miss

1037
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:05,000
Wiki. Driving

1038
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:07,000
Miss Wiki is the name of this

1039
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:09,000
podcast. It is recorded as the host

1040
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:11,000
drives home

1041
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:13,000
where the host's passenger

1042
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:15,000
I wish we had more information

1043
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:17,000
about that. I know. I want to actually

1044
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:19,000
take the unprecedented step

1045
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:21,000
of actually clicking research

1046
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:23,000
to the website and researching.

1047
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:25,000
Nope. It's taking too long.

1048
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:27,000
I can't

1049
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:29,000
figure it out.

1050
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:31,000
Come on Justin. Hop on Nexus Lexus.

1051
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:33,000
Let's crack this shit.

1052
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:35,000
Driving Miss Wiki is the name of the podcast.

1053
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:37,000
It is recorded on a drive

1054
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:39,000
as a passenger reads to

1055
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:41,000
the driver who is also the

1056
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:43,000
host. A Wikipedia

1057
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:45,000
article and they discuss them.

1058
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:47,000
Past episodes

1059
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:49,000
are not episodes. That's not a word.

1060
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:51,000
Wow. You've had a lot of trouble reading this message.

1061
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:53,000
This is actually your second attempt at it and you

1062
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:55,000
fucked it up just as bad as the first.

1063
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:57,000
Yeah. Thank you. Thank you.

1064
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:59,000
Thank you. Thank you. I'm just saying it's noteworthy

1065
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:01,000
how bad you're doing.

1066
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:03,000
Is Travis the glue that holds this fucking

1067
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:05,000
boat together? Has he been holding us together

1068
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:07,000
this entire time? The show is called

1069
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:09,000
Driving Miss Wiki. Let me tell you about it.

1070
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:11,000
No God. No. Not again.

1071
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:13,000
Some of the

1072
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:15,000
topics they've discussed included the company

1073
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:17,000
of Merchant Adventures, Marshall

1074
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:19,000
Island Stick Charts, Prague, Texas

1075
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:21,000
and Caruncles.

1076
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:23,000
Those are of course

1077
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:25,000
uncle cars.

1078
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:27,000
Cars that are brothers

1079
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:29,000
to other cars

1080
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:31,000
that have sexually reproduced.

1081
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:33,000
Your hosts are Parker

1082
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:35,000
and Mary or Marie

1083
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:37,000
perhaps. Let's go with Marie.

1084
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:39,000
Yeah. So I found that out

1085
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:41,000
through some research

1086
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:43,000
and you can find their podcast at

1087
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:45,000
drivingmisswiki.com or

1088
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:47,000
by heading over to iTunes

1089
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:49,000
and searching for Driving Miss

1090
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:51,000
Wiki. I also want to

1091
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:53,000
shout out this

1092
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:55,000
message for Tuna

1093
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:57,000
and it's from

1094
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:59,000
Twin who says happy 30th

1095
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:01,000
birthday to my PIC.

1096
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:03,000
PIC.

1097
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:05,000
Thank you for showing me the wonderful

1098
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:07,000
world of podcasts especially

1099
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:09,000
my bim bam. I can't wait to record

1100
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:11,000
our competing comedy advice

1101
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:13,000
podcast and put these clowns out of business for good?

1102
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:15,000
You the best and I like you

1103
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:17,000
a lot? How could you?

1104
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:19,000
How could you do this? Did want

1105
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:21,000
to get this one on

1106
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:23,000
or around July 2nd

1107
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:25,000
so

1108
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:27,000
pretty good job I thought.

1109
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:29,000
On that note first of all

1110
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:31,000
fucking step up to the plate.

1111
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:33,000
If you want to step into the terror

1112
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:35,000
dome. If you think you're capable

1113
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:37,000
go ahead because you

1114
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:39,000
know what? Feed my

1115
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:41,000
Frankenstein. I'm hungry. Yeah come

1116
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:43,000
on. Come on. Step

1117
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:45,000
up. Many have tried some have failed

1118
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:47,000
bring it on.

1119
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:49,000
Also want to say on the subject of us being

1120
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:51,000
extremely late on Jumbotrons

1121
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:53,000
there's been a freeze on

1122
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:55,000
new Jumbotron messages

1123
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:57,000
so if you wanted to get a message on the show you

1124
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:59,000
haven't been able to for a while because all our spots

1125
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:01,000
got done filled up. They're going

1126
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:03,000
to open them. This feels like

1127
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:05,000
weird to talk about that our listeners are so

1128
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:07,000
like down and so supportive

1129
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:09,000
that they have flooded us with

1130
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:11,000
Jumbotron messages. If you want to get a message

1131
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:13,000
on the show they're going to open up

1132
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:15,000
spots in 2017

1133
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:17,000
on November

1134
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:19,000
28th. That's Cyber Monday.

1135
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:21,000
They're going to open up. I

1136
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:23,000
say they we don't actually sell

1137
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:25,000
the Jumbotron spots. Max Fun handles that

1138
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:27,000
for us and so they're going to open up some spots

1139
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:29,000
in 2017. If you want to get a message on the show

1140
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:31,000
November 28th Cyber Monday

1141
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:33,000
those messages are going to

1142
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:35,000
those slots are going to open up. So

1143
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:37,000
if you want to get a message on the show next year

1144
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:39,000
which is like your earliest option

1145
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:41,000
go go hop on

1146
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:43,000
maximumfun.org slash Jumbotron then

1147
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:45,000
and good luck.

1148
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:47,000
Good luck.

1149
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:49,000
Anything else bro. Oh God they

1150
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:51,000
just announced today

1151
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:53,000
and obviously we knew about

1152
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:55,000
this the the CISO show

1153
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:57,000
that we did. My Brother My Brother and Me

1154
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:59,000
TV show has a release date.

1155
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:01,000
Yep February 23rd 2017

1156
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:03,000
is when that's going to air

1157
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:05,000
and I think I really think

1158
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:07,000
you're going to like it a lot. Yeah we've been watching

1159
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:09,000
some we've been watching some episodes and they're

1160
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:11,000
they're they're good man. I'm really

1161
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:13,000
really proud of it and happy about it.

1162
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:15,000
We made them so we're biased.

1163
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:17,000
I know but like I'm so I'm so

1164
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:19,000
excited for everybody else to see them. I

1165
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:21,000
really think this is going to be one of those situations

1166
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:23,000
where I

1167
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:25,000
I'm not embarrassed of a thing

1168
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:27,000
that we made which is so rare

1169
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:29,000
so rare.

1170
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:31,000
So that's cool.

1171
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:33,000
Anything else before we let people get back to it.

1172
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:35,000
Not that I can think of.

1173
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:37,000
Thank you all for sticking with us for this

1174
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:39,000
best of episode.

1175
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:41,000
I just like

1176
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:43,000
sort of blanket like we have some

1177
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:45,000
filler Eps prep for all the shows

1178
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:47,000
so just expect

1179
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:49,000
I guess a little bit of

1180
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:51,000
what's the word I'm looking for.

1181
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:53,000
It may not be. I don't know if disruption.

1182
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:55,000
Yeah I don't know what like the next

1183
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:57,000
it's because we expected these

1184
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:59,000
babies much closer together.

1185
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:01,000
So I don't know. We don't know exactly

1186
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:03,000
how this is all going to

1187
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:05,000
go but I think it's going to be

1188
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:07,000
just fine. It's going to be just fine.

1189
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:09,000
We are

1190
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:11,000
again so excited for Travis and Theresa

1191
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:13,000
and just expect like

1192
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:15,000
especially once Rachel and I

1193
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:17,000
have our baby in December

1194
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:19,000
just like expect this podcast to just be

1195
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:21,000
like three fucking Tim Allen's

1196
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:23,000
three fucking Ray Romano's just laying

1197
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:25,000
it down completely

1198
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:27,000
inaccessible to all non dads

1199
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:29,000
and they're doing all right.

1200
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:31,000
You're not a dad. You're locked the fuck

1201
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:33,000
out of this humor because it is all

1202
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:35,000
all the way down baby

1203
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:37,000
all that humor. So anyway

1204
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:39,000
I stepped on another leg

1205
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:41,000
go like shit that you

1206
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:43,000
guys are not going to like at all

1207
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:45,000
anymore. Like you're going to fucking

1208
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:47,000
hate it. That jumbotron problem is going to

1209
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:49,000
resolve itself. Yeah we're going to be done

1210
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:51,000
with this show. Yeah it's going

1211
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:53,000
to be guys it's gonna be

1212
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:55,000
shit.

1213
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:57,000
Anyway happy Halloween.

1214
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:59,000
I'm Bez and I'm Theresa and we

1215
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:01,000
host the weekly comedy podcast

1216
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:03,000
One Bad Mother. We celebrate our moments

1217
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:05,000
of parenting genius as well as

1218
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:07,000
our failures. Just like

1219
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:09,000
we're going to have hot dogs and I'm like

1220
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:11,000
no we're having fun everybody loves hot dogs

1221
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:13,000
and it just like smashes that thing right on my

1222
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:15,000
chest and then I'm just crying in the middle of like

1223
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:17,000
kids space while people are like literally dancing with their

1224
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:19,000
children. Parenting can be sad and

1225
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:21,000
painfully funny at the same time.

1226
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:23,000
So join us each week as

1227
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:25,000
we admit that this is hard but we're getting

1228
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:27,000
really good at it. Find us at

1229
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:29,000
maximumfun.org or wherever you download

1230
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:31,000
podcasts.

1231
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:35,000
It's two words alt

1232
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:37,000
tab. Alt

1233
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:39,000
tab. Now what does that mean. That's

1234
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:41,000
shady though when you see when you

1235
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:43,000
walk into somebody and you're like is

1236
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:45,000
that a dick and then it

1237
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:47,000
flickers really quickly. Whoa whoa whoa how personal

1238
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:49,000
do you think this is going.

1239
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:51,000
They're live streaming a bris.

1240
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:53,000
I assumed it was like

1241
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:55,000
I assumed it was like they were looking at bee dogs.

1242
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:57,000
Travis no

1243
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:59,000
one except you

1244
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:01,000
looks at bee dogs. R has

1245
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:03,000
ever looked at bee dogs. I think in

1246
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:05,000
Colombia bee dogs is pretty big.

1247
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:07,000
When you say bee dogs no

1248
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:09,000
one knows what the fuck you're talking

1249
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:11,000
about. I think you guys

1250
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:13,000
will find that many people know

1251
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:15,000
what I'm talking about. No one knows

1252
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:17,000
what bee dogs are except you. I think

1253
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:19,000
that bee dogs is a pretty big deal.

1254
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:21,000
I want to see how much

1255
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:23,000
I will tell you that no one knows

1256
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:25,000
what bee dogs are.

1257
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:27,000
I think you'll find

1258
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:29,000
that bee dogs are pretty

1259
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:31,000
popular. It's like listening to

1260
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:33,000
Mariah Carey kibitz.

1261
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:35,000
When you bring up bee dogs it makes

1262
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:37,000
everybody sadder because they don't know what the fuck

1263
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:39,000
you're saying. And it's

1264
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:41,000
time for them to learn.

1265
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:43,000
Hey guys I want to talk to you about

1266
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:45,000
bee dogs. No, no, no. Fair enough.

1267
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:47,000
You're not using our show as a

1268
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:49,000
platform for spraying your madness.

1269
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:51,000
What themed party can I

1270
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:53,000
have for Halloween? I want to

1271
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:55,000
attract lots of lovely ladies.

1272
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:57,000
Oh behave.

1273
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:59,000
Oh no. All right Griffin I'm

1274
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:01,000

1280
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:13,000
That is enough.

1281
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:19,000
What themed party

1282
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:21,000
can I have for Halloween?

1283
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:23,000
I want to

1284
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:25,000
attract lots of lovely ladies.

1285
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:27,000
Oh behave.

1286
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:29,000
That was miserable.

1287
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:31,000
It sounded like Austin Powers had a stroke.

1288
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:35,000
I did.

1289
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:37,000
Oh behave.

1290
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:39,000
Can I

1291
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:41,000
say something? I think this person

1292
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:43,000
has their heart set on a theme.

1293
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:45,000
I think the

1294
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:47,000
theme has been decided.

1295
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:49,000
Guys I don't want to get outside of

1296
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:51,000
the question but

1297
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:53,000
is it possible that this person has just chosen

1298
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:55,000
to live an Austin Powers lifestyle?

1299
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:57,000
Oh here.

1300
00:49:57,000 --> 00:49:59,000
Can I share

1301
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:01,000
the top answer?

1302
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:03,000
Please. The top answer

1303
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:05,000
from Yahoo Answers is

1304
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:07,000
Rock Titan says

1305
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:09,000
it's

1306
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:11,000
April.

1307
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:19,000
Oh he's the

1308
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:21,000
pragmatist. Oh that's great.

1309
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:23,000
This Yahoo

1310
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:25,000
Answer is sent in by Diane.

1311
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:27,000
Thanks Diane.

1312
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:29,000
It's by Yahoo Answers user Jared

1313
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:31,000
Ancharski

1314
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:33,000
who asks

1315
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:35,000
I got arrested for smoking weed

1316
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:37,000
and my court date is soon.

1317
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:39,000
If I come into court in a karate uniform

1318
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:41,000
am I good?

1319
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:45,000
Am I okay here?

1320
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:47,000
In what context?

1321
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:49,000
Will the judge make my punishment lenient since he knows

1322
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:51,000
I do karate?

1323
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:53,000
Exactly.

1324
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:55,000
If he knows you've got your karate game right?

1325
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:57,000
Additional details.

1326
00:50:57,000 --> 00:50:59,000
Since they know I do karate they'll know I do

1327
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:01,000
other activities besides chill around

1328
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:03,000
and smoke so will that help or no?

1329
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:05,000
See this

1330
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:07,000
it's like an onion this question.

1331
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:09,000
Now this

1332
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:11,000
only works if you do a fashion

1333
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:13,000
show. So you come in your karate outfit

1334
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:15,000
and then you come in your horse riding outfit.

1335
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:17,000
This is a hard hat.

1336
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:19,000
I do construction things.

1337
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:21,000
And also I'm a milkman apparently.

1338
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:23,000
Someone give me a hammer.

1339
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:25,000
Boy was I ever lucky to get

1340
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:27,000
Judge Samo Hung.

1341
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:29,000
He's been very lenient

1342
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:31,000
about my gi.

1343
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:33,000
Samo Hung

1344
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:35,000
was one of the karate guys

1345
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:37,000
on Walker Texas Ranger.

1346
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:39,000
Go on.

1347
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:41,000
One of the karate guys on Walker Texas Ranger.

1348
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:43,000
I could have gone for Chuck Norris but I feel like

1349
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:45,000
his

1350
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:47,000
I think the thing

1351
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:49,000
Chuck Norris is a hanging judge.

1352
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:51,000
Everyone knows that.

1353
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:53,000
Is there anything this gentleman

1354
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:55,000
can wear other

1355
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:57,000
than a suit

1356
00:51:57,000 --> 00:51:59,000
that he says I heart judges.

1357
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:01,000
OK but that's

1358
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:03,000
that's probably not going to do it because I think

1359
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:05,000
I don't think you can wear any shirt that says I

1360
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:07,000
heart anything on it and then I heart judges

1361
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:09,000
a lot. People don't what about a sarcastic

1362
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:11,000
maybe a Judge Reinhold

1363
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:13,000
mask.

1364
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:15,000
Hey listen judge to judge

1365
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:17,000
are we cool. Am I good.

1366
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:19,000
I've got this Judge

1367
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:21,000
Reinhold mask and a karate gi.

1368
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:23,000
Are we going to waive these charges

1369
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:25,000
or what. Can we can we work that

1370
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:27,000
into our catchphrase vernacular.

1371
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:29,000
Am I good.

1372
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:31,000
Anytime you say

1373
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:33,000
something terrible or faux pas

1374
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:35,000
just real quick. Oh shit. Am I good.

1375
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:37,000
Am I good.

1376
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:39,000
Hey I came to court in a karate gi.

1377
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:41,000
Am I good.

1378
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:43,000
So I'm just going to go. I assume

1379
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:45,000
the charges have been dropped. Uh huh. Am I good.

1380
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:47,000
I just

1381
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:49,000
I just chopped your gavel in half.

1382
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:51,000
Am I good.

1383
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:53,000
What's that smell.

1384
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:55,000
It's not weed. I promise.

1385
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:57,000
To what extent

1386
00:52:57,000 --> 00:52:59,000
does the color of

1387
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:01,000
belt that this person has

1388
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:03,000
all the difference in the world.

1389
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:05,000
OK.

1390
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:07,000
I mean either way you chop it

1391
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:09,000
if he's got a white belt

1392
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:11,000
he's not going to a intimidate the judge or

1393
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:13,000
be impress him with

1394
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:15,000
the amount of time that he has spent in karate

1395
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:17,000
chopping class. You can get the

1396
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:19,000
white belt blue belt brown

1397
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:21,000
belt yellow belt all within

1398
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:23,000
like a week and a half if

1399
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:25,000
you pay and if you slip a few you know extra

1400
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:27,000
hundo's to your sensei.

1401
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:29,000
From what I've seen

1402
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:31,000
there if you were to graph my

1403
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:33,000
respect for people in

1404
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:35,000
the martial arts it's a pretty

1405
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:37,000
steady curve up until you hit

1406
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:39,000
black belt and then it

1407
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:41,000
branches pretty radically

1408
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:43,000
in two different directions where

1409
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:45,000
on the one hand I am

1410
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:47,000
for some of those people

1411
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:49,000
I am like wow really

1412
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:51,000
odd by the dedication to your

1413
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:53,000
craft and then the other people

1414
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:55,000
it's like just

1415
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:57,000
put on just get a job

1416
00:53:57,000 --> 00:53:59,000
put on a suit and

1417
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:01,000
learn how to play lacrosse and

1418
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:03,000
please get your life together.

1419
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:05,000
It just strikes me as one of those things that in my life if someone

1420
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:07,000
were to say to me oh yeah I have a black belt

1421
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:09,000
the next two words out of my

1422
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:11,000
mouth are prove it.

1423
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:13,000
I don't know

1424
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:15,000
what that entails I don't know if that's like

1425
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:17,000
chop through this wall or fight me

1426
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:19,000
or what it is but there's something about someone

1427
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:21,000
making that statement where I'm like

1428
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:23,000
oh yeah prove it.

1429
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:25,000
Chop that horse in half.

1430
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:27,000
A black belt is really only

1431
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:29,000
a value add to a person

1432
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:31,000
when nobody knows

1433
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:33,000
that they have it.

1434
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:35,000
If I got a black belt I wouldn't tell

1435
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:37,000
fucking I would go take my classes

1436
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:39,000
in another state.

1437
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:41,000
So that people would. What classes?

1438
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:43,000
Oh karate classes. Karate classes.

1439
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:45,000
And then when I came

1440
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:47,000
back and like if shit came down

1441
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:49,000
and I did a chop and a kick

1442
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:51,000
and a man died then people would be like what?

1443
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:53,000
I'd be like oh don't worry about it.

1444
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:55,000
I would never ever admit the fact that I have a black.

1445
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:57,000
Spray your jacket to the side and show them just a

1446
00:54:57,000 --> 00:54:59,000
little glimpse of black belt. Because if

1447
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:01,000
I ever said the word out loud to somebody oh I have

1448
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:03,000
a black belt they're gonna make all kinds of wild

1449
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:05,000
assumptions about me. Right.

1450
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:07,000
Which are probably all going to be true. They're going to be

1451
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:09,000
very true. But I would rather

1452
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:11,000
not be subject to that.

1453
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:13,000
Do you think that when you get the black belt itself

1454
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:15,000
it's reversible?

1455
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:17,000
In case you want to wear brown shoes?

1456
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:21,000
Idiot.

1457
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:25,000
So this is why. This is your

1458
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:27,000
outfit okay. You come into court.

1459
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:29,000
You're wearing black dress shoes

1460
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:31,000
a black belt and you have a tie.

1461
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:33,000
You go to the judge and you say

1462
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:35,000
am I good?

1463
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:37,000
As you can see

1464
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:39,000
I'm in my formal gi.

1465
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:41,000
Am I good?

1466
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:43,000
This is my dress gi. Am I good?

1467
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:45,000
I have a funeral to go to.

1468
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:47,000
I'm gonna karate chop the

1469
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:49,000
coffin in half.

1470
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:51,000
I can't believe you'd hold a karate master

1471
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:53,000
here.

1472
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:55,000
You don't know the lightning you're bottling

1473
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:57,000
up here. You can't put

1474
00:55:57,000 --> 00:55:59,000
me in a cell. I will not be responsible

1475
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:01,000
for the damage I do

1476
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:03,000
if you lock me in a cell with another person.

1477
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:05,000
I'll whittle their bones down

1478
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:07,000
and make a ki. I can't be

1479
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:09,000
responsible. I don't know that karate

1480
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:11,000
is the kind of thing that you can do if you're high

1481
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:13,000
on that sweet sweet dojo.

1482
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:17,000
If you're rocking dojo

1483
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:19,000
I don't think that

1484
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:21,000
your skills are going to be as

1485
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:23,000
high as you want them to be.

1486
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:25,000
No

1487
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:29,000
Three puns intended.

1488
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:31,000
Yes and no.

1489
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:33,000
To the outside observer

1490
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:35,000
you will be very bad at karate.

1491
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:37,000
To your own perception

1492
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:39,000
you will be on a fucking

1493
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:41,000
kung fu other plane kill

1494
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:43,000
bill style.

1495
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:45,000
Body parallel flat to the ground.

1496
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:47,000
You against the crazy 88's

1497
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:49,000
just losing your mind, chopping off

1498
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:51,000
limbs. Mortal Kombat

1499
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:53,000
fly through the air bicycle kick.

1500
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:55,000
You're just laying on the ground

1501
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:57,000
and rolling about. You're

1502
00:56:57,000 --> 00:56:59,000
listening to 311 and you're eating Starburst.

1503
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:01,000
I got a

1504
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:03,000
FTP login you can check

1505
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:05,000
out. You're gonna love

1506
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:07,000
my files and folders.

1507
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:11,000
Don't go too many trees deep

1508
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:13,000
cause it gets weird.

1509
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:17,000
Stay in the index.

1510
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:19,000
Let's just say stay in the index.

1511
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:21,000
If you find yourself four or five folders in

1512
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:23,000
just unplug your

1513
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:25,000
computer. Just pull this string and I'll get you

1514
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:27,000
out.

1515
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:29,000
You need Joseph Gordon Levitt to give

1516
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:31,000
you the kick.

1517
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:35,000
Unless you don't like horse assholes.

1518
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:37,000
Get Joseph Gordon Levitt to give you

1519
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:39,000
the kick.

1520
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:41,000
This yahoo was sent in by

1521
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:43,000
Liana which was

1522
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:45,000
sent to her by her friend Keith.

1523
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:47,000
So thank you both people

1524
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:49,000
in this arrangement.

1525
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:51,000
Many

1526
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:53,000
boffins died to bring us this yahoo

1527
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:55,000
so let's really enjoy it.

1528
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:57,000
It was asked by yahoo answers user

1529
00:57:57,000 --> 00:57:59,000
Geof who asks

1530
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:01,000
is it okay to draw on a dog

1531
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:03,000
with magic marker?

1532
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:05,000
Sometimes when my

1533
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:07,000
stepdad Ron grounds me I'll write

1534
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:09,000
messages on

1535
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:11,000
my dog. He is white with

1536
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:13,000
washable marker and send him downstairs.

1537
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:15,000
Just little messages like

1538
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:17,000
if I need food or about how much I

1539
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:19,000
hate my stepdad Ron.

1540
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:21,000
My mom

1541
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:23,000
said it would make the dog sick. Is she right?

1542
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:27,000
So many

1543
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:29,000
more problems with the best stepdad

1544
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:31,000
name ever is Ron.

1545
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:33,000
Got some dog mail for you Ron.

1546
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:35,000
Fuck off.

1547
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:37,000
I hate you Ron.

1548
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:39,000
I hate you so much. Come here Mr.

1549
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:41,000
Perkins. What's it?

1550
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:43,000
Aw man.

1551
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:45,000
That really helps. That hurts myself as

1552
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:47,000
I'm trying so hard. That hurts my Ron

1553
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:49,000
esteem. I don't like that one bit.

1554
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:51,000
Can you give me the

1555
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:53,000
question one more time Griffin? Is it

1556
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:55,000
okay to draw on a dog with magic marker?

1557
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:57,000
Sometimes when my stepdad Ron grounds me

1558
00:58:57,000 --> 00:58:59,000
I'll write messages on my dog.

1559
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:01,000
He is white

1560
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:03,000
with magic marker. Just little messages

1561
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:05,000
like if I need food or about how

1562
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:07,000
much I hate my stepdad Ron.

1563
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:09,000
I'm imagining like a Yorkshire terrier

1564
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:11,000
like bounding down the stairs running up

1565
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:13,000
to Ron and it's like a message on him

1566
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:15,000
like hey Ron I smell that chili. What the

1567
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:17,000
fuck? You're such a bastard. I'm super

1568
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:19,000
hungry. I got a message for you

1569
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:21,000
Ron. I'm a dog.

1570
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:23,000
And also the person asking this question

1571
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:25,000
is 32. Yeah.

1572
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:27,000
God damn you Ron.

1573
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:29,000
Now listen to me Sparky. I want you to go

1574
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:31,000
upstairs. I want you to find Ron.

1575
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:33,000
I want you to just wiggle in front of him.

1576
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:35,000
You gotta make sure he reads this. It's important.

1577
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:37,000
I've been trapped under this bookcase

1578
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:39,000
for two weeks. I gotta get some

1579
00:59:39,000 --> 00:59:41,000
pasta up here. I'm so hungry. Also tell

1580
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:43,000
Ron fuck you Ron.

1581
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:45,000
If Ron wants to rescue

1582
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:47,000
me tell him to fuck clean off. I hate

1583
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:49,000
Ron. Tell him to send my mom

1584
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:51,000
and ask if my mom is back

1585
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:53,000
with my fruit roll ups yet.

1586
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:55,000
I sent her to the store

1587
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:57,000
20 minutes ago for fruit roll ups.

1588
00:59:57,000 --> 00:59:59,000
Mr. Perkins you look kind of sick.

1589
00:59:59,000 --> 01:00:01,000
What happened?

1590
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:03,000
Is it the markers?

1591
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:05,000
Is it your skin? It's you or me

1592
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:07,000
Mr. Perkins.

1593
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:09,000
Maybe you learned how to talk English.

1594
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:11,000
Stupid dog.

1595
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:13,000
Poor Ron.

1596
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:15,000
What a fucking

1597
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:17,000
sick bird. He's just trying to watch Extreme Home Makeover

1598
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:19,000
and all of a sudden the dog

1599
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:21,000
trots in front of the screen. It looks like a drawing of a knife

1600
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:23,000
stabbed and an arrow

1601
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:25,000
that says Ron. This is you Ron.

1602
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:27,000
This is what I want to do to you. Look at the dog.

1603
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:31,000
Oh Jesus.

1604
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:33,000
It says I love you Ron. I'm my dog.

1605
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:35,000
Oh he rolled over. It says no I don't.

1606
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:37,000
And it says fuck you Ron again on it.

1607
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:39,000
With an arrow towards the dog's penis.

1608
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:43,000
Tyler I thought

1609
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:45,000
you were going to come pick me up from work.

1610
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:47,000
Did you not read the dog?

1611
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:49,000
I said fuck you and fuck your job.

1612
01:00:49,000 --> 01:00:51,000
I'm not coming to pick you up.

1613
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:53,000
And also that we were out of eggs.

1614
01:00:53,000 --> 01:00:55,000
Did you tell mom?

1615
01:00:55,000 --> 01:00:57,000
I wrote it on the dog Ron.

1616
01:00:57,000 --> 01:00:59,000
What else do you want me to do?

1617
01:00:59,000 --> 01:01:01,000
I can't force

1618
01:01:01,000 --> 01:01:03,000
the dog to stand in front of you all day.

1619
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:05,000
Please just read the dog.

1620
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:07,000
You used all the paper for your stupid

1621
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:09,000
novel Ron.

1622
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:11,000
How's that going Ron? Did you find a

1623
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:13,000
publisher yet?

1624
01:01:13,000 --> 01:01:15,000
In this economy Ron you might as well

1625
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:17,000
self publish your stupid shit.

1626
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:19,000
Put it on Kindle.

1627
01:01:19,000 --> 01:01:21,000
I've got a Tumblr dog.

1628
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:23,000
Where I just put messages. Why can't you get a Tumblr dog?

1629
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:25,000
Can we

1630
01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:27,000
make it a new law?

1631
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:29,000
Sort of like in Game of Thrones

1632
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:31,000
if you're a bastard your name is Snow.

1633
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:33,000
Can we make it that the second you become

1634
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:35,000
a stepdad your name just becomes

1635
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:37,000
Ron by law?

1636
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:39,000
Legally speaking

1637
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:41,000
I now pronounce you wife and

1638
01:01:41,000 --> 01:01:43,000
Ron.

1639
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:45,000
It's not even your name so much as

1640
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:47,000
like Earl.

1641
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:49,000
It's like an honorary title but his name is not Earl.

1642
01:01:49,000 --> 01:01:51,000
You're officially like the Don

1643
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:53,000
of this house.

1644
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:55,000
You're the Ron.

1645
01:01:55,000 --> 01:01:57,000
You're the Ron Don.

1646
01:01:57,000 --> 01:01:59,000
So let's see.

1647
01:01:59,000 --> 01:02:01,000
You've got to get WednesdayWolf.com

1648
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:03,000
the imps.org

1649
01:02:03,000 --> 01:02:05,000
mobrulesgames.com

1650
01:02:05,000 --> 01:02:07,000
and indiegogo.com

1651
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:09,000
Actually Mob Rules Games

1652
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:11,000
I already busted one out for them.

1653
01:02:11,000 --> 01:02:13,000
I will give them a final draft of that

1654
01:02:13,000 --> 01:02:15,000
come the end of this promotion.

1655
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:17,000
Don't take this the wrong way.

1656
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:19,000
The imps and WednesdayWolf.

1657
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:21,000
I like the idea of Daymere pile of

1658
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:23,000
watercolor donors.

1659
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:25,000
Start there.

1660
01:02:25,000 --> 01:02:27,000
What does that cover?

1661
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:29,000
That covers WednesdayWolf

1662
01:02:29,000 --> 01:02:31,000
and the imp.

1663
01:02:31,000 --> 01:02:33,000
It covers all three?

1664
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:35,000
They all want money.

1665
01:02:35,000 --> 01:02:37,000
That's the connector. Everybody wants money.

1666
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:39,000
Here we go.

1667
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:41,000
Hold on.

1668
01:02:41,000 --> 01:02:43,000
Let me take a try.

1669
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:45,000
Build a Daymere

1670
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:47,000
pile of

1671
01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:49,000
watercolor donors.

1672
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:51,000
All these businesses need funds

1673
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:53,000
to operate.

1674
01:02:53,000 --> 01:02:55,000
You can help WednesdayWolf

1675
01:02:55,000 --> 01:02:57,000
the imps don't

1676
01:02:57,000 --> 01:02:59,000
take the wrong way.

1677
01:02:59,000 --> 01:03:01,000
That's almost what it's called.

1678
01:03:01,000 --> 01:03:03,000
But I ran out of words in the verse.

1679
01:03:05,000 --> 01:03:07,000
Go give them some cash

1680
01:03:07,000 --> 01:03:09,000
to chase all of their

1681
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:11,000
dreams around.

1682
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:17,000
I like how it ended on some of that unresolved

1683
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:19,000
dreams of

1684
01:03:19,000 --> 01:03:21,000
dreams.

1685
01:03:23,000 --> 01:03:25,000
I don't know guys.

1686
01:03:25,000 --> 01:03:27,000
Build a Daymere

1687
01:03:27,000 --> 01:03:29,000
pile of

1688
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:31,000
watercolor donors.

1689
01:03:31,000 --> 01:03:33,000
You need to give

1690
01:03:33,000 --> 01:03:35,000
these people lots of cash.

1691
01:03:37,000 --> 01:03:39,000
That's how the market works.

1692
01:03:39,000 --> 01:03:41,000
They take your money and turn

1693
01:03:41,000 --> 01:03:43,000
it into goods and services.

1694
01:03:43,000 --> 01:03:45,000
You can take those services

1695
01:03:45,000 --> 01:03:47,000
to the bank.

1696
01:03:47,000 --> 01:03:49,000
While they take your

1697
01:03:49,000 --> 01:03:51,000
literal money to the bank.

1698
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:53,000
Visit

1699
01:03:53,000 --> 01:03:55,000
WednesdayWolf.com

1700
01:03:55,000 --> 01:03:57,000
the imps.org and don't take this the

1701
01:03:57,000 --> 01:03:59,000
wrong way's website which you can probably find

1702
01:03:59,000 --> 01:04:25,000
on google.

1703
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:31,000
Fuck.

1704
01:04:41,000 --> 01:04:43,000
Make sure to join us at

1705
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:45,000

1706
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:47,000
party on McGillicuddy's deck.

1707
01:04:47,000 --> 01:04:49,000
To the sequel.

1708
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:51,000
Party your deck off at

1709
01:04:51,000 --> 01:04:53,000
McGillicuddy's.

1710
01:04:53,000 --> 01:04:55,000
Get your deck wet.

1711
01:04:55,000 --> 01:04:57,000
Come get your deck wet with $2

1712
01:04:57,000 --> 01:04:59,000
washer splashes all night long.

1713
01:05:01,000 --> 01:05:03,000
The hottest

1714
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:05,000
babes. The hottest guys.

1715
01:05:05,000 --> 01:05:07,000
The drunkest children.

1716
01:05:07,000 --> 01:05:09,000
The wildest monkeys.

1717
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:11,000
The craziest poop throwing monkeys

1718
01:05:11,000 --> 01:05:13,000
you've ever seen. And good

1719
01:05:13,000 --> 01:05:15,000
news ladies. Margaritas

1720
01:05:15,000 --> 01:05:17,000
are just $3 all night long.

1721
01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:19,000
Monkeys get in free till

1722
01:05:19,000 --> 01:05:21,000
midnight.

1723
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:23,000
Hey monkey it's 1230.

1724
01:05:23,000 --> 01:05:25,000
Come on in anyway.

1725
01:05:25,000 --> 01:05:27,000
It's McGillicuddy.

1726
01:05:27,000 --> 01:05:29,000
21 and up for male monkeys.

1727
01:05:29,000 --> 01:05:31,000
18 for female monkeys.

1728
01:05:31,000 --> 01:05:33,000
I don't even know if monkeys live that long.

1729
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:35,000
What the fuck.

1730
01:05:35,000 --> 01:05:37,000
Half man half monkeys will be submitted

1731
01:05:37,000 --> 01:05:39,000
for study at

1732
01:05:39,000 --> 01:05:41,000
research institutes nationwide.

1733
01:05:41,000 --> 01:05:43,000
So

1734
01:05:43,000 --> 01:05:45,000
summer's here. Summer's here

1735
01:05:45,000 --> 01:05:47,000
again. Do you guys wanna

1736
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:49,000
yahoo answer? Yes.

1737
01:05:49,000 --> 01:05:51,000
Yeah. This one was sent in by Josh

1738
01:05:51,000 --> 01:05:53,000
Papow. I haven't

1739
01:05:53,000 --> 01:05:55,000
decided if it's the kind of question

1740
01:05:55,000 --> 01:05:57,000
that we could get

1741
01:05:57,000 --> 01:05:59,000
in trouble for reading yet.

1742
01:05:59,000 --> 01:06:01,000
Okay. Yay.

1743
01:06:01,000 --> 01:06:03,000
Thank you Josh. So yahoo

1744
01:06:03,000 --> 01:06:05,000
answers to your question Mark who asked

1745
01:06:05,000 --> 01:06:07,000
really freaked out my girlfriend. Need help?

1746
01:06:07,000 --> 01:06:09,000
As a teenager I suffered

1747
01:06:09,000 --> 01:06:11,000
from severe depression

1748
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:13,000
and formed a strong bond with the character

1749
01:06:13,000 --> 01:06:15,000
Garfield and his outlook.

1750
01:06:15,000 --> 01:06:17,000
It's sad but

1751
01:06:17,000 --> 01:06:19,000
reading

1752
01:06:19,000 --> 01:06:21,000
Garfield anthologies obsessively was

1753
01:06:21,000 --> 01:06:23,000
the only thing that made me feel normal.

1754
01:06:23,000 --> 01:06:25,000
And it eventually took on something

1755
01:06:25,000 --> 01:06:27,000
of an erotic fixation.

1756
01:06:27,000 --> 01:06:29,000
Oh no.

1757
01:06:29,000 --> 01:06:31,000
And I think you mispronounced

1758
01:06:31,000 --> 01:06:33,000
normal.

1759
01:06:37,000 --> 01:06:39,000
Reading Garfield books obsessively made me

1760
01:06:39,000 --> 01:06:41,000
feel normal.

1761
01:06:41,000 --> 01:06:43,000
To avoid feeling like a sicko

1762
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:45,000
I drew pictures of Garfield with

1763
01:06:45,000 --> 01:06:47,000
a woman's I think a Pamela Anderson

1764
01:06:47,000 --> 01:06:49,000
circa 1991 body

1765
01:06:49,000 --> 01:06:51,000
and Garfield's head.

1766
01:06:51,000 --> 01:06:53,000
These drawings eventually evolved into

1767
01:06:53,000 --> 01:06:55,000
erotic fan fiction starring Garfield and myself.

1768
01:06:55,000 --> 01:06:57,000
In my head Garfield still

1769
01:06:57,000 --> 01:06:59,000
has a woman's body but someone

1770
01:06:59,000 --> 01:07:01,000
reading the stories would think I'm having sex

1771
01:07:01,000 --> 01:07:03,000
with regular Garfield. I killed

1772
01:07:03,000 --> 01:07:05,000
off John in a jealous rage.

1773
01:07:05,000 --> 01:07:07,000
I didn't touch Odie. I enjoy his

1774
01:07:07,000 --> 01:07:09,000
companionship and don't mind if he watches.

1775
01:07:11,000 --> 01:07:13,000
What the fuck?

1776
01:07:13,000 --> 01:07:15,000
The stories are your pretty basic wish

1777
01:07:15,000 --> 01:07:17,000
fulfillment stuff balanced with a

1778
01:07:17,000 --> 01:07:19,000
self loathing rants.

1779
01:07:19,000 --> 01:07:21,000
Yeah pretty basic stuff.

1780
01:07:21,000 --> 01:07:23,000
Nothing out of the ordinary here.

1781
01:07:23,000 --> 01:07:25,000
I've been doing this near daily for years

1782
01:07:25,000 --> 01:07:27,000
and I have a substantial amount of writing in a folder

1783
01:07:27,000 --> 01:07:29,000
I keep buried in eight different folders.

1784
01:07:29,000 --> 01:07:31,000
My girlfriend stumbled

1785
01:07:31,000 --> 01:07:33,000
across them by accident when they came

1786
01:07:33,000 --> 01:07:35,000
up in a search and is pretty freaked out.

1787
01:07:35,000 --> 01:07:37,000
How can I show her I'm just a

1788
01:07:37,000 --> 01:07:39,000
normal guy with a weird outlet

1789
01:07:39,000 --> 01:07:41,000
from my psychological problems and not

1790
01:07:41,000 --> 01:07:43,000
some kind of sicko. And then they

1791
01:07:43,000 --> 01:07:45,000
included a sample of some of the erotic fiction

1792
01:07:45,000 --> 01:07:47,000
and I didn't think I would ever

1793
01:07:47,000 --> 01:07:49,000
say this on this podcast but it's too

1794
01:07:49,000 --> 01:07:51,000
gross to read out loud.

1795
01:07:51,000 --> 01:07:53,000
Guys I know different

1796
01:07:53,000 --> 01:07:55,000
strokes for different folks.

1797
01:07:55,000 --> 01:07:57,000
We've all got something

1798
01:07:57,000 --> 01:07:59,000
buried deep inside that you

1799
01:07:59,000 --> 01:08:01,000
never ever ever want

1800
01:08:01,000 --> 01:08:03,000
anybody to know ever. Now I'm not

1801
01:08:03,000 --> 01:08:05,000
saying mine would be as weird

1802
01:08:05,000 --> 01:08:07,000
as putting a woman's body

1803
01:08:07,000 --> 01:08:09,000
on Garfield's head but it's

1804
01:08:09,000 --> 01:08:11,000
pretty fucking weird. The secret

1805
01:08:11,000 --> 01:08:13,000
to not getting made fun of

1806
01:08:13,000 --> 01:08:15,000
is that you can't tell the entire

1807
01:08:15,000 --> 01:08:17,000
world which is on the

1808
01:08:17,000 --> 01:08:19,000
internet. This is a secret

1809
01:08:19,000 --> 01:08:21,000
you can never. You're embarrassed your

1810
01:08:21,000 --> 01:08:23,000
girlfriend found out so you decided to put it on

1811
01:08:23,000 --> 01:08:25,000
the internet? How bad are you at

1812
01:08:25,000 --> 01:08:27,000
internet? You can't hide a yahoo

1813
01:08:27,000 --> 01:08:29,000
answer in folders.

1814
01:08:29,000 --> 01:08:31,000
No. Cause I found it.

1815
01:08:31,000 --> 01:08:33,000
I found it and I know it forever now.

1816
01:08:33,000 --> 01:08:35,000
Yeah. I'm just

1817
01:08:35,000 --> 01:08:37,000
if Jim Davis ever saw these drawings

1818
01:08:37,000 --> 01:08:39,000
I think he would literally fucking die.

1819
01:08:39,000 --> 01:08:41,000
I think he would fucking die. I think his

1820
01:08:41,000 --> 01:08:43,000
heart would explode in his chest and he would die.

1821
01:08:43,000 --> 01:08:45,000
He would say my baby! And then he'd die.

1822
01:08:45,000 --> 01:08:47,000
Hey real quick. Just for a second.

1823
01:08:47,000 --> 01:08:49,000
Let's play devil's advocate

1824
01:08:49,000 --> 01:08:51,000
here and just like get ourselves in

1825
01:08:51,000 --> 01:08:53,000
this guy's head space and just like imagine.

1826
01:08:53,000 --> 01:08:55,000
No I'm not. I don't want to do that at all.

1827
01:08:55,000 --> 01:08:57,000
Come through the door.

1828
01:08:57,000 --> 01:08:59,000
We're gonna step into this

1829
01:08:59,000 --> 01:09:01,000
guy's mind. What if I die

1830
01:09:01,000 --> 01:09:03,000
in this dream? If you die in the dream you'll be

1831
01:09:03,000 --> 01:09:05,000
stuck in Garfield fucking limbo

1832
01:09:05,000 --> 01:09:07,000
forever. You need Joseph Gordon

1833
01:09:07,000 --> 01:09:09,000
Leavitt to give you the kick. Yeah yeah.

1834
01:09:09,000 --> 01:09:11,000
He'll kick you in the head until you die.

1835
01:09:11,000 --> 01:09:13,000
Give me the kick. I'm ready.

1836
01:09:13,000 --> 01:09:15,000
Which

1837
01:09:15,000 --> 01:09:17,000
would you

1838
01:09:17,000 --> 01:09:19,000
come on

1839
01:09:19,000 --> 01:09:21,000
which would you prefer?

1840
01:09:21,000 --> 01:09:23,000
Pamela Anderson body and Garfield

1841
01:09:23,000 --> 01:09:25,000
head or Garfield body and Pamela Anderson head?

1842
01:09:25,000 --> 01:09:27,000
If you had to

1843
01:09:27,000 --> 01:09:29,000
party down on one of those bad

1844
01:09:29,000 --> 01:09:31,000
boys

1845
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:33,000
which would you go with?

1846
01:09:33,000 --> 01:09:35,000
Additional information. The Garfield head is wearing

1847
01:09:35,000 --> 01:09:37,000
sunglasses.

1848
01:09:37,000 --> 01:09:39,000
Garfield

1849
01:09:39,000 --> 01:09:41,000
body suction cup hands or no suction

1850
01:09:41,000 --> 01:09:43,000
cup hands?

1851
01:09:43,000 --> 01:09:45,000
Either or.

1852
01:09:45,000 --> 01:09:47,000
Whichever would be more

1853
01:09:47,000 --> 01:09:49,000
pleasurable. Is Odie there

1854
01:09:49,000 --> 01:09:51,000
and is he just jerking it so

1855
01:09:51,000 --> 01:09:53,000
right? Odie loves what he sees.

1856
01:09:53,000 --> 01:09:55,000
Either way

1857
01:09:55,000 --> 01:09:57,000
Odie's down.

1858
01:09:57,000 --> 01:09:59,000
Odie is down to clown.

1859
01:09:59,000 --> 01:10:01,000
Justin do you want to pick first?

1860
01:10:03,000 --> 01:10:05,000
Well Griffin

1861
01:10:05,000 --> 01:10:07,000
you ask the questions so you have to answer.

1862
01:10:07,000 --> 01:10:09,000
Fuck.

1863
01:10:09,000 --> 01:10:11,000
I'll say

1864
01:10:11,000 --> 01:10:13,000
I'll say

1865
01:10:13,000 --> 01:10:15,000
if it's Bill Murray's voice

1866
01:10:15,000 --> 01:10:17,000
Pam body

1867
01:10:17,000 --> 01:10:19,000
Garfield head. Travis?

1868
01:10:19,000 --> 01:10:21,000
Oh no I've already killed myself

1869
01:10:21,000 --> 01:10:23,000
in this situation.

1870
01:10:23,000 --> 01:10:25,000
Can I

1871
01:10:25,000 --> 01:10:27,000
throw Travis's body at the corpse

1872
01:10:27,000 --> 01:10:29,000
and buy myself enough time

1873
01:10:29,000 --> 01:10:31,000
Travis's corpse at the

1874
01:10:31,000 --> 01:10:33,000
creation and buy myself enough time

1875
01:10:33,000 --> 01:10:35,000
Here's the problem though. You throw it at Pam body

1876
01:10:35,000 --> 01:10:37,000
Garf head. Who's that coming up from behind?

1877
01:10:37,000 --> 01:10:39,000
It's Garf body Pam head

1878
01:10:39,000 --> 01:10:41,000
and it is

1879
01:10:41,000 --> 01:10:43,000
very upset.

1880
01:10:43,000 --> 01:10:45,000
For many reasons. You have

1881
01:10:45,000 --> 01:10:47,000
in your inventory a dagger

1882
01:10:47,000 --> 01:10:49,000
and a shield.

1883
01:10:49,000 --> 01:10:51,000
Open doors are

1884
01:10:51,000 --> 01:10:53,000
west and north.

1885
01:10:53,000 --> 01:10:55,000
Okay can I

1886
01:10:55,000 --> 01:10:57,000
I am going to go

1887
01:10:57,000 --> 01:10:59,000
with Pam head

1888
01:10:59,000 --> 01:11:01,000
Garfield body but Lorenzo

1889
01:11:01,000 --> 01:11:03,000
music voice.

1890
01:11:03,000 --> 01:11:05,000
I have a thing

1891
01:11:05,000 --> 01:11:07,000
with the real Ghostbusters so

1892
01:11:07,000 --> 01:11:09,000
I think that would be enough to get me through it

1893
01:11:09,000 --> 01:11:11,000
and also

1894
01:11:11,000 --> 01:11:13,000
You're worried about finishing?

1895
01:11:13,000 --> 01:11:15,000
I can't

1896
01:11:15,000 --> 01:11:17,000
I can't

1897
01:11:17,000 --> 01:11:19,000
You also changed Pam Anderson's

1898
01:11:19,000 --> 01:11:21,000
voice to Garfield's.

1899
01:11:21,000 --> 01:11:23,000
Now listen if I have

1900
01:11:23,000 --> 01:11:25,000
I have too much respect for Bill Murray's

1901
01:11:25,000 --> 01:11:27,000
work. If it's Lorenzo music

1902
01:11:27,000 --> 01:11:29,000
But you could have left Pamela Anderson's voice

1903
01:11:29,000 --> 01:11:31,000
Why does it have to be Garfield's voice?

1904
01:11:31,000 --> 01:11:33,000
I don't see why Pam Anderson's voice is not going to come out of

1905
01:11:33,000 --> 01:11:35,000
Garfield's head.

1906
01:11:35,000 --> 01:11:37,000
And I

1907
01:11:37,000 --> 01:11:39,000
find Larry the crash test dummy

1908
01:11:39,000 --> 01:11:41,000
to be a very soothing sexual influence

1909
01:11:41,000 --> 01:11:43,000
So if I can pretend

1910
01:11:43,000 --> 01:11:45,000
that if it's Lorenzo music's voice

1911
01:11:45,000 --> 01:11:47,000
and I can pretend it's Peter

1912
01:11:47,000 --> 01:11:49,000
Venkman of the Ghostbusters cartoon

1913
01:11:49,000 --> 01:11:51,000
or Larry the crash test dummy

1914
01:11:51,000 --> 01:11:53,000
or perhaps even tummy gummy from

1915
01:11:53,000 --> 01:11:55,000
Disney's Avengers gummy bears

1916
01:11:55,000 --> 01:11:57,000
How many other cartoons can you ruin for me right now?

1917
01:11:57,000 --> 01:11:59,000
I can't

1918
01:11:59,000 --> 01:12:01,000
That's all Lorenzo music that I'm aware of

1919
01:12:01,000 --> 01:12:03,000
He's probably something else

1920
01:12:03,000 --> 01:12:05,000
That thought didn't even

1921
01:12:05,000 --> 01:12:07,000
The thought of what would be the most

1922
01:12:07,000 --> 01:12:09,000
sexually pleasurable

1923
01:12:09,000 --> 01:12:11,000
That didn't even cross my mind. This was pure

1924
01:12:11,000 --> 01:12:13,000
survival instincts

1925
01:12:13,000 --> 01:12:15,000
I've got all of these pizza shaped disks

1926
01:12:15,000 --> 01:12:17,000
left over from my Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles

1927
01:12:17,000 --> 01:12:19,000
sewer boat

1928
01:12:19,000 --> 01:12:21,000
Just the disks. I got rid of the boat

1929
01:12:21,000 --> 01:12:23,000
but I've probably got 150 of them

1930
01:12:23,000 --> 01:12:25,000
Right. Different years

1931
01:12:25,000 --> 01:12:27,000
If you come over to Travis's house

1932
01:12:27,000 --> 01:12:29,000
he's coming to the pizza disk room

1933
01:12:29,000 --> 01:12:31,000
and he's showing you

1934
01:12:31,000 --> 01:12:33,000
the ones with small factory imperfections

1935
01:12:33,000 --> 01:12:35,000
and that kind of thing

1936
01:12:35,000 --> 01:12:37,000
Basically all I did was just stable them to the wall

1937
01:12:37,000 --> 01:12:39,000
directly. There's no

1938
01:12:39,000 --> 01:12:41,000
furniture in the room. There's a body

1939
01:12:41,000 --> 01:12:43,000
but I don't ask about it

1940
01:12:43,000 --> 01:12:45,000
There are five

1941
01:12:45,000 --> 01:12:47,000
people right now who just threw

1942
01:12:47,000 --> 01:12:49,000
down their iPod and ran into their

1943
01:12:49,000 --> 01:12:51,000
attic like, where's my fucking pizza launcher?

1944
01:12:51,000 --> 01:12:53,000
Dad!

1945
01:12:53,000 --> 01:12:55,000
Dad! Dad!

1946
01:12:55,000 --> 01:12:57,000
Dad! You promised

1947
01:12:57,000 --> 01:12:59,000
You said that

1948
01:12:59,000 --> 01:13:01,000
if I kept up my GPA that you wouldn't

1949
01:13:01,000 --> 01:13:03,000
throw away my pizza launcher

1950
01:13:03,000 --> 01:13:05,000
What do you mean I'm 32?

1951
01:13:05,000 --> 01:13:07,000
What do you mean you died 7 years ago?

1952
01:13:07,000 --> 01:13:09,000
Dad! How long have I been asleep?

1953
01:13:09,000 --> 01:13:11,000
Dad!

1954
01:13:11,000 --> 01:13:13,000
Dad!

1955
01:13:13,000 --> 01:13:15,000
I think that old man was a genie

1956
01:13:15,000 --> 01:13:17,000
Dad!

1957
01:13:17,000 --> 01:13:19,000
I think I got a genie curse

1958
01:13:19,000 --> 01:13:21,000
Dad!

1959
01:13:21,000 --> 01:13:23,000
I don't know what you want

1960
01:13:23,000 --> 01:13:25,000
He says he's governor

1961
01:13:25,000 --> 01:13:27,000
What's going on?

1962
01:13:27,000 --> 01:13:29,000
I used to be Zac Efron and now I'm Steve Buscemi

1963
01:13:29,000 --> 01:13:31,000
Help me!

1964
01:13:31,000 --> 01:13:33,000
Dad!

1965
01:13:33,000 --> 01:13:35,000
I've got adult

1966
01:13:35,000 --> 01:13:37,000
balls and no pizza launcher

1967
01:13:37,000 --> 01:13:39,000
What gives?

1968
01:13:39,000 --> 01:13:41,000
Dad!

1969
01:13:41,000 --> 01:13:43,000
I wanted my suit to fit over the counter

1970
01:13:43,000 --> 01:13:45,000
What's going on?

1971
01:13:45,000 --> 01:13:47,000
They said I couldn't

1972
01:13:47,000 --> 01:13:49,000
at the store

1973
01:13:49,000 --> 01:13:51,000
Is that a

1974
01:13:51,000 --> 01:13:53,000
problem you would like to?

1975
01:13:53,000 --> 01:13:55,000
I can't find

1976
01:13:55,000 --> 01:13:57,000
Jost on the shelves!

1977
01:13:57,000 --> 01:13:59,000
Dad!

1978
01:13:59,000 --> 01:14:01,000
I've been without electricity

1979
01:14:01,000 --> 01:14:03,000
for a week

1980
01:14:03,000 --> 01:14:05,000
and while I was without

1981
01:14:05,000 --> 01:14:07,000
electricity I started reading books

1982
01:14:07,000 --> 01:14:09,000
Oh, I see

1983
01:14:09,000 --> 01:14:11,000
Okay, so this is books, man

1984
01:14:11,000 --> 01:14:13,000
This is educated

1985
01:14:13,000 --> 01:14:15,000
Justin

1986
01:14:15,000 --> 01:14:17,000
This is your brain on books

1987
01:14:17,000 --> 01:14:19,000
This is what they do

1988
01:14:19,000 --> 01:14:21,000
So in your mind this is what educated people sound like?

1989
01:14:21,000 --> 01:14:23,000
I

1990
01:14:23,000 --> 01:14:25,000
in circles

1991
01:14:25,000 --> 01:14:27,000
I am in electoral circles

1992
01:14:27,000 --> 01:14:29,000
This is what my friends

1993
01:14:29,000 --> 01:14:31,000
and I, this is how we speak

1994
01:14:31,000 --> 01:14:33,000
Justin, I want you to know

1995
01:14:33,000 --> 01:14:35,000
I picture you right now surrounded by bookcases

1996
01:14:35,000 --> 01:14:37,000
but your brain has swollen and you just have like a giant

1997
01:14:37,000 --> 01:14:39,000
forehead

1998
01:14:39,000 --> 01:14:41,000
Tell me

1999
01:14:41,000 --> 01:14:43,000
I have become top heavy

2000
01:14:43,000 --> 01:14:45,000
but without electricity I was not able

2001
01:14:45,000 --> 01:14:47,000
to watch my programs

2002
01:14:47,000 --> 01:14:49,000
I was not able to play video games

2003
01:14:49,000 --> 01:14:51,000
and I was forced

2004
01:14:51,000 --> 01:14:53,000
to read and now I've been exposed

2005
01:14:53,000 --> 01:14:55,000
to all the great culture

2006
01:14:55,000 --> 01:14:57,000
of the world

2007
01:14:57,000 --> 01:14:59,000
How

2008
01:14:59,000 --> 01:15:01,000
How sallow is

2009
01:15:01,000 --> 01:15:03,000
your skin? Can you give me some sort of

2010
01:15:03,000 --> 01:15:05,000
salowness rating?

2011
01:15:05,000 --> 01:15:07,000
It looks like an orange fruit

2012
01:15:07,000 --> 01:15:09,000
by the bottom

2013
01:15:11,000 --> 01:15:13,000
Did you get

2014
01:15:13,000 --> 01:15:15,000
a book jaundice? What happened?

2015
01:15:15,000 --> 01:15:17,000
No, he was just reading books and eating

2016
01:15:17,000 --> 01:15:19,000
carrots the entire time

2017
01:15:19,000 --> 01:15:21,000
As they ran out of power they had to eat their

2018
01:15:21,000 --> 01:15:23,000
stock of baby carrots

2019
01:15:23,000 --> 01:15:25,000
I was forced

2020
01:15:25,000 --> 01:15:27,000
to eat the butterflies I've

2021
01:15:27,000 --> 01:15:29,000
preserved over the years behind

2022
01:15:29,000 --> 01:15:31,000
glass

2023
01:15:31,000 --> 01:15:33,000
Nutritionally devoid

2024
01:15:33,000 --> 01:15:35,000
but

2025
01:15:35,000 --> 01:15:37,000
surprisingly very pleasing

2026
01:15:37,000 --> 01:15:39,000
to the palate

2027
01:15:39,000 --> 01:15:41,000
Yeah

2028
01:15:41,000 --> 01:15:43,000
All that voice wants to do is eat something

2029
01:15:43,000 --> 01:15:45,000
beautiful

2030
01:15:47,000 --> 01:15:49,000
So this is our advice program

2031
01:15:49,000 --> 01:15:51,000
My brother, my brother and me

2032
01:15:51,000 --> 01:15:53,000
will dole out

2033
01:15:53,000 --> 01:15:55,000
intellectual

2034
01:15:55,000 --> 01:15:57,000
conversational

2035
01:15:57,000 --> 01:15:59,000
advice

2036
01:15:59,000 --> 01:16:01,000
You're hearing like hard right, what is this voice

2037
01:16:01,000 --> 01:16:03,000
doing? I think he's just

2038
01:16:03,000 --> 01:16:05,000
turning into a condor also

2039
01:16:05,000 --> 01:16:07,000
It's

2040
01:16:07,000 --> 01:16:09,000
bucking underneath me

2041
01:16:09,000 --> 01:16:11,000
Bucking wildly

2042
01:16:11,000 --> 01:16:13,000
It wants desperately to go scar's guard

2043
01:16:13,000 --> 01:16:15,000
I won't

2044
01:16:15,000 --> 01:16:17,000
let it. I'm holding on to the reins

2045
01:16:17,000 --> 01:16:19,000
as sadly as I can

2046
01:16:19,000 --> 01:16:21,000
Oh god it's devolved

2047
01:16:21,000 --> 01:16:23,000
into Ed Grimley. Somebody help me

2048
01:16:23,000 --> 01:16:25,000

2049
01:16:25,000 --> 01:16:27,000
