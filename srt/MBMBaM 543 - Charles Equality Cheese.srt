1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there will know how cool they are for listening.

4
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Here come the McElroys, we've got jokes and bits.

6
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
We're gonna give advice and do funny sticks.

7
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Laughter, it is in store.

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Come inside and see, it's time to start.

9
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:40,000
It's my brother, my brother and me.

10
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Hello everybody, and welcome to My Brother, My Brother, and Me, an advice show for the modern era.

11
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy.

12
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Woof woof, dog pound, I'm your mangiest brother, Travis McElroy.

13
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Uh, who's got a bone?

14
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:00,000
I'm Griffin McElroy, I apologize, I did not commit to the bit.

15
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I've been practicing mine all week.

16
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Yeah, sorry everybody.

17
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Sorry.

18
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
I've been working with Bruce Valanche to script mine, Griffin.

19
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:13,000
I can't, I put the time in, I paid premium, top dollar.

20
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,000
For that Bruce Valanche educational cameo.

21
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Bum bum bum bum bum bum.

22
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Wow.

23
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Oh.

24
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Bum bum bum bum bum bum.

25
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Alright.

26
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:27,000
I want a munch.

27
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Squad.

28
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,000
For America.

29
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Bum bum.

30
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
I want to munch for America.

31
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Bum bum bum bum bum.

32
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Hello, welcome to Munch Squad, it's a podcast within a podcast.

33
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Profiling the latest and greatest in brand eating.

34
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Justin, sorry to interrupt, just to be a bit of a pedant.

35
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,000
It is kind of a podcast before a podcast at this point.

36
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
It's kind of our opener.

37
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Yes.

38
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
It's a pre-roll podcast.

39
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:55,000
So I guess, you know, it's a, it's a weird time to be recording a podcast.

40
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:59,000
We usually record on Thursdays and last Thursday we were like,

41
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,000
we don't know what the fuck is happening.

42
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Well, to be fair, we didn't want to record on Thursday and our reasoning is

43
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
we don't know, we don't know what Monday is like,

44
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:11,000
but now we're looking at publishing this one Tuesday morning after recording it Thursday afternoon

45
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:15,000
and we're still like, I don't know what fucking 5pm looks like.

46
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Yeah.

47
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
So that's where we're at.

48
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
And what is the question on everybody's lips?

49
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Well, it's where does pizza stand on election integrity as the bedrock of American democracy?

50
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:32,000
And of course everybody knows that this has been a wild time in America

51
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:36,000
and I feel like everybody's got to speak out and everybody's got to speak up

52
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,000
for what they think is important, right?

53
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Hey, just real quick.

54
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Is this a new indicator, much like the it's been a tough year for everyone kind of thing?

55
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Yeah, this is, what do you mean a new indicator?

56
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Is this something like a new buzzword, a new pull quote?

57
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Is Domino's going to be out there and be like, election integrity is our whole shit?

58
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:59,000
No, Griffin, but Pizza Inn is.

59
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Pizza Inn?

60
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Pizza Inn?

61
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Pizza Inn is a chain of pizza restaurants.

62
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Pizza Inn, there's like a bunch of them and there may not be one near you, like Captain Inn,

63
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:18,000
but there's locations all over this great land of ours, mainly in the Southeast of America.

64
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
There's some in Texas, Griff.

65
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
You could go to a Pizza Inn right now if you wanted to.

66
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,000
There's 32 in Texas.

67
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Cool.

68
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Based on this segment, it sounds like, Justin, that might be a morally difficult dining decision on my part.

69
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Okay, well, let's just talk about it and let's talk about what's happening in America through the lens of pizza.

70
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Yeah.

71
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Because I'm taking a stand and it's a very small stand, but it's a stand I feel like I, Justin McElroy, could impact.

72
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Okay.

73
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Okay.

74
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
I'm going to read you the press release, right?

75
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:53,000
And Pizza Inn releases as a press release.

76
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Can I just say, I'm sorry, Pizza Inn is a terrible name for a restaurant.

77
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Unless you're allowed to sleep there if you eat too much, I do not get the tie-in.

78
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Yeah, confusing.

79
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Yeah, it is confusing.

80
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:08,000
I want to thank Jasper and Megan for sending this one along.

81
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
I appreciate this.

82
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
I probably wouldn't have heard about it otherwise.

83
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Pizza Inn, this press release has said to me, the original press release on PR Newswire was deleted.

84
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:21,000
So I actually don't know what was happening there.

85
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:29,000
The good news is Pizza Inn has left this entire 20 tweet chain on their page.

86
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
So let's just get right into it.

87
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Pizza Inn is calling for election reform.

88
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Here's the tweets.

89
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Big money out of politics.

90
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
I'm all for that.

91
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Like, is that what we're talking about?

92
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Pizza Inn takes bold stance for election reform.

93
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Widespread concerns over fraud, demand commonsense, changes to...

94
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Oh, not that Pizza Inn.

95
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Hashtag election fraud.

96
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Hashtag Washington, D.C.

97
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Hashtag January 6th.

98
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:59,000
This was tweeted January 5th, which as far as timing for shit goes, it's a pretty bad timing, Pizza Inn.

99
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
I will go ahead and give you that one.

100
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Pizza Inn can't get on an airplane now.

101
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:10,000
It is squarely focused on creating a close-knit community centered on traditional American values.

102
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:18,000
And these values include the preservation of American democracy, which millions of brave men and women have fought to protect.

103
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
I'm with them so far.

104
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Well, I'm not.

105
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Well, Justin, I don't know how I feel about it.

106
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Well, hey, listen.

107
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Now we can all, as great Americans, we can all...

108
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,000
There's only one great American I like, Justin, and that's the cookie.

109
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Well, Bill Nye also.

110
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Nope.

111
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Okay.

112
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
I'm off Bill Nye now, too.

113
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Just great American cookie and great American ballpark.

114
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Two great Americans that I like.

115
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:45,000
As the new year begins, our nation continues to be divided at the results of the recent election.

116
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
I mean, not really.

117
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Not super.

118
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Not really.

119
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
I feel like it's settled.

120
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Millions of Americans believe that widespread voter fraud may have changed the results of the presidential election, says Pizza Inn.

121
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:04,000
The next tweet, Pizza Inn has laid out their theme, right?

122
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,000
And you're like, no way is Pizza Inn going to go any harder than this.

123
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:10,000
And then Pizza Inn's like, we believe this is probable.

124
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Take it from us.

125
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Pizza Inn, we believe the fix is in.

126
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Holy shit.

127
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Like most Americans, we are alarmed by the uncertainties and resulting lack of faith in our election system.

128
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Most Americans, huh?

129
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Brandon Solano, chief executive officer of Rave Restaurant Group Incorporated.

130
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:31,000
What a bold and incorrect stance.

131
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:36,000
I am so sick of these fucking celebrity Twitter accounts telling me what to think.

132
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Politics elite.

133
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Pizza Inn, this is so crucial.

134
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Pizza Inn is not advocating to overturn the election.

135
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Oh, thank God.

136
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Nor do we think hastily certifying the results in Congress tomorrow is appropriate.

137
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Well, now hold on.

138
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Those aren't equal.

139
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:00,000
We fully understand the risks of wading into such heated political waters.

140
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Now, here's where I do want to have you go ahead and take a step back here.

141
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
January 5th tweet from Pizza Inn.

142
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Do you think you fully understand the risks of wading into such heated political waters on January 5th?

143
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Because I think, my friend, you don't actually.

144
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,000
You actually don't understand.

145
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
You may have even underestimated it a little bit.

146
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
A little bit.

147
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Maybe just a pinch.

148
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Here's a tweet.

149
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,000
We at Pizza Inn aren't constitutional scholars.

150
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Oh?

151
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Fuck yeah.

152
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Cool.

153
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Every pizza chain should have to tweet that.

154
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Hey, Pizza Hut.

155
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Well, we got one, don't we?

156
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Yeah, we got Robby.

157
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Robby dropped out.

158
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
All right, Robby dropped out.

159
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Oh, damn it.

160
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
He didn't get it.

161
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Two years?

162
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
No, he did two years.

163
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Not bad.

164
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
We at Pizza Inn aren't constitutional scholars.

165
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:53,000
We're experts at making amazing pizza and salads.

166
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:58,000
That is when governors and other elected officials are shutting down our dining rooms.

167
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Now, hold on.

168
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:04,000
The second part does not change the first part, factually speaking.

169
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Well, now that our dining rooms are closed.

170
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
It's almost like you're tipping your hand a little bit.

171
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Congratulations to them by making it 20 tweets and being like, listen, we don't know what happened here.

172
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
We're just thinking transparency is important.

173
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Also, these fucking mask weenies, right?

174
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Yeah, come get our dirty, sloppy, germy pizza with extra sauce and extra fucking microbes, baby.

175
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Let me get one mushroom sausage and some fucking Spyro Keats on it, baby.

176
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
I'm not going to read them because it's garbage.

177
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:40,000
But like Pizza Inn then goes so far as to we are literally 20 tweets in at this point.

178
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Pizza Inn then goes so far as to spend two bullet pointed tweets detailing exactly what changes they require in election integrity.

179
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,000
I would say voter suppression from Pizza Inn.

180
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Pizza Inn wants to suppress your votes.

181
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Pizza Inn wants to definitely suppress the shit out of the votes.

182
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Now, to be fair, Justin, they did offer in tweet 27 that if you bring in your mail-in ballot instead of mailing it in,

183
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:12,000
they will give you one free personal pan pizza.

184
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Not bad there.

185
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Pizza Inn on January 5th, the last tweet in this chain was,

186
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Pizza Inn respects citizens' rights to agree or disagree with us, boycott us or visit us in solidarity.

187
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:31,000
We simply ask that each of us remain civil in our discussions,

188
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:36,000
confident in the knowledge that we love our country and want what's best for it on January 5th.

189
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,000
This is hot shit.

190
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
If only they'd seen.

191
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:44,000
If only they knew how to delete tweets.

192
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
If only they'd seen. If only they knew.

193
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:54,000
I mean, they also, it looks like they have tweeted at every seditionist member of Congress.

194
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Yeah, they basically copied all of them like,

195
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
Hey, do you guys ever backs or what?

196
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Because this is basically our big play.

197
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,000
Hey Nunez, Nunez, you got us, right?

198
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Yeah.

199
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Can you imagine?

200
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
We want to become the exclusive pizza of the Trump trains.

201
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
You guys got to get us on board somehow.

202
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
We don't know what Pizza Gate is, but we heard a lot about it.

203
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
We want to get in.

204
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
We want to get in on that.

205
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Pizza Inn.

206
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:22,000
Can you imagine anything sadder or from our perspective,

207
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:28,000
more kind of ironic and delightful than somebody going to Pizza Inn

208
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:33,000
and getting one of their super sloppy micro pizzas that then that gives them COVID.

209
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:38,000
And that's not funny as much as then they can't taste anything anymore.

210
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:43,000
And Pizza Inn's fucking shitty pizza is the last thing they ever taste.

211
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:47,000
Whenever they think about, they'll be eating a fine fancy steak dinner.

212
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
Oh, a Kobe beef, loving it.

213
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
There's that Wagyu.

214
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,000
How's it taste?

215
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
I can't taste it.

216
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:57,000
But when I think about what food tastes like, I think of fucking Pizza Inn.

217
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Senator Ted Cruz's favorite pizza.

218
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
Oh, I love it.

219
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:05,000
Did you guys see the Kevin Sorbo tweets?

220
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Kevin Sorbo is tearing.

221
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
We're not moving on from this yet.

222
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,000
Oh, sorry.

223
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,000
Thank you.

224
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:15,000
Pizza Inn tweeted this on, again, January 5th.

225
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,000
Uh-huh.

226
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:20,000
And did not have a big tweet after that.

227
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:24,000
But as like recently as a few days ago, people started saying like,

228
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:27,000
Hey, Pizza Inn, how do you think it's going right now?

229
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:32,000
Hey, Pizza Inn, how does this look in hindsight for you?

230
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,000
How does this feel to you right now?

231
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:40,000
I'll give you a sampling here because a lot of people started coming for Pizza Inn.

232
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
I like this one from Juan Brown who said,

233
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:45,000
No comment on today's news and no cactus bread.

234
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:48,000
This is why Pizza Ranch will always be superior.

235
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,000
Fuck yeah, Juan, get them.

236
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,000
Get them.

237
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,000
Fucking get them.

238
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
Pizza Ranch isn't about sleeping there.

239
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,000
It's about riding there.

240
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,000
Yeah.

241
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
Pizza Inn responded to Juan Brown,

242
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:00,000
which is absolutely where you need to make a statement like this.

243
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,000
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.

244
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:07,000
It replies to a tweet from a person with 164 followers.

245
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:11,000
We condemn the shameful display of violence shown at our nation's capital.

246
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:16,000
We have always and will continue to call for civility and nonviolence from us.

247
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
Also, sorry about the cactus bread thing.

248
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:23,000
Listen, cactus bread was a real fuck up on our part.

249
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:32,000
Then they responded to literally like 15 other people with the same verbatim tweet.

250
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:43,000
So I saw this today and in a rare example of trying to like shape Munch Squad to my own means.

251
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:50,000
And the reason I wanted to hold this episode's recording until today was I wanted to take a stand.

252
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:56,000
And I'm asking the other pizza chains to take a stand as well.

253
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:00,000
I tweeted this incredible pizza in thread,

254
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:08,000
and then I called on Domino's, Marco's Pizza, Papa John's Pizza Hut, Chuck E Cheese, Little Caesar's, Mellow Mushroom, and fuck it, DiGiorno,

255
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:14,000
to announce where they stand on the importance of a peaceful transfer of power as a core tenet of American democracy.

256
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
And I told them it's time to take a stand.

257
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:20,000
Now, right now, let me go ahead and see where we're at.

258
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,000
Yeah, got any bites?

259
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
Well, it seems like a grounder to me, right?

260
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
Yeah, seems like an easy decision.

261
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:29,000
Especially with Shaq at the helm over at P. John's.

262
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:32,000
Okay, you know, Shaq loves democracy.

263
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
Yeah, I'm not seeing any.

264
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:39,000
Okay, so far, none of those brands have taken me up on my offer,

265
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:46,000
which is weird if you think about it, because I'm opening the door for them to say the very easy thing,

266
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
and they are declining that door.

267
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:53,000
Pizza In wanted to say the hard thing, and no one asked Pizza In to say it,

268
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:57,000
but they were like, hold on a second, we've got something to say.

269
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,000
They were like, hold my beer.

270
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:02,000
And then everybody from a hundred miles away was like, who are you talking to?

271
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,000
There is no one.

272
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:09,000
Set your beer on the floor, because there's nobody around you right now.

273
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
What is there to hold your beer?

274
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,000
Hey, Justin?

275
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,000
Yeah?

276
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,000
Did you reach out to Totino's?

277
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
No, I figure I knew where they stand.

278
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:19,000
Also, they've given us a lot of money to do a sponsored episode for them,

279
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,000
so I'm not going to put them on blast.

280
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:24,000
What am I, some sort of freethinking hippie liberal?

281
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:30,000
No, I kept this peaceful protest to the companies that have not lined our pockets.

282
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,000
Fair, fair, fair.

283
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:34,000
At any point, that I know of.

284
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
I want to talk about fucking Kevin Sorbo for a second.

285
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
Okay, yeah, bud, Kevin Sorbo.

286
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:41,000
Motherfucking Hercules, more like Jercules.

287
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:45,000
He tweeted a series of tweets, like, it's happening.

288
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
Four fucking rad tweets.

289
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:50,000
Like, it's happening, and then like, oh yeah, this is awesome.

290
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:53,000
And then like, hey everybody, don't act like Antifa.

291
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:56,000
And then the fourth tweet is, I'm hearing it wasn't really protest,

292
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:59,000
you're just Antifa dressed like Trump supporters.

293
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:02,000
Such a wonderful, like, uh, uh, uh.

294
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,000
You know what I heard?

295
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:07,000
My uncle told me that he was actually just Antifa.

296
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:10,000
And then fucking Louie Lawless, my girl, came out of nowhere,

297
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
and was like, you look like a dumb shit.

298
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,000
It was so good.

299
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
It was pretty fucking yummy.

300
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:18,000
Where does Eola stand on all this, Trav?

301
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
He's an independent.

302
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
Our Hercules reporter on the ground.

303
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,000
He's an independent.

304
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:26,000
What a fucking, what a fucking week.

305
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,000
Huh?

306
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
We went back and forth, guys, about how to do this one.

307
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,000
I don't fucking know.

308
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
It's wild out there.

309
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:35,000
It's literally, while we are now, while we are recording this,

310
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:39,000
the US Department of State website just updated to say

311
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:42,000
that President Trump's term ended just now.

312
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,000
And everybody's like, is this real?

313
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,000
Is this fake?

314
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:47,000
Like, there's not a great window for us to do a show.

315
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,000
Hold on.

316
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,000
I don't think it is.

317
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
I don't think it's, I think it's probably a goof.

318
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,000
You know how they do a lot of great goofs.

319
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,000
It's probably a fun goof, but like.

320
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:59,000
I just want to say, just to sort of place an import on it as well,

321
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:02,000
you know, hit up the pizza places and ask them where they stand.

322
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:05,000
But also, I would encourage you to go to 5calls,

323
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:09,000
number5calls.org, and contact your representatives.

324
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,000
It's great.

325
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:14,000
They have a list of active issues that you can kind of choose your own adventure,

326
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:17,000
and it'll give you some tips on how to contact your reps.

327
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
And there's so many of them right now.

328
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,000
There's so many.

329
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,000
There's so many.

330
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,000
There's a lot of different issues.

331
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
There's a lot of different things that you should,

332
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:28,000
there's a lot of different accountability subjects that are worth following through.

333
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:32,000
And the number one is, where does the pizza company stand?

334
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:38,000
No, that's actually just the number one in the ones we might have some theoretical possibility.

335
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
That's the one that, we can move the chains on that one,

336
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,000
but you can move the chains on everything else.

337
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:44,000
Number5calls.org, do it.

338
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,000
Make it a habit.

339
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
Make that your fucking hobby for 2021.

340
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
That's big dog run energy right there.

341
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,000
Oh, yeah, it is.

342
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:53,000
Hey, can I say, can we speak on that for a moment?

343
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,000
Let's speak on big dog run for a moment.

344
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,000
I want to speak on big dog run.

345
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:58,000
I was thinking about it and I was having some fun because our friend,

346
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:04,000
it's not a big deal, it's just a lot of our famous beloved friends were calling me

347
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
to tell me how much they loved the episode.

348
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,000
And they're like, you did it.

349
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,000
You crushed it.

350
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:11,000
And I was chatting with them and I was thinking like,

351
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:17,000
we did that on Monday and then things got weirder,

352
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
so much weirder and worse, like right after that.

353
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:23,000
Hold on, they got really good Tuesday night.

354
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
Tuesday night was like, fuck yeah.

355
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
What happened Tuesday night?

356
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:31,000
Oh, that's when the Democrats took the Senate.

357
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:35,000
Well, that wasn't official until the next, you know what I'm saying?

358
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,000
That's true, that's fair, that's fair.

359
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,000
It was so wild, but anyway.

360
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:42,000
Let's just say I was feeling a lot of big dog run energy from Tuesday evening

361
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:46,000
to I'll say Monday around 11 o'clock central time.

362
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,000
And then that energy left me.

363
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:55,000
I was so grateful for big dog run because I was trying to think of what theme

364
00:17:55,000 --> 00:18:00,000
we could have picked in the year that would have been instantly undone

365
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
and subverted by the offense of the past week.

366
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,000
Yeah.

367
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:08,000
And actually big dog run is the literal only theme that wouldn't have been just

368
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
like absolutely trouts.

369
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:13,000
Anything inspirational or uplifting would have been instantly undone.

370
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:16,000
But big dog run, you know what it is?

371
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,000
What's that Justin?

372
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
It's a mantra.

373
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,000
It doesn't mean anything.

374
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:24,000
It's something for you to meditate on and you take away from it whatever.

375
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:29,000
You come to it innocently and effortlessly and you just kind of see what comes of it

376
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
of racing on big dog run.

377
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:34,000
We learned about this on Schmaners.

378
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:38,000
There is a German saying of like, this is sausage to me.

379
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:42,000
And I love it because like, I don't know how much that actually means,

380
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:46,000
but it's a good response to a lot of things, much like no bones about it.

381
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:51,000
Like that is something like you could say if someone was upset or happy or sad,

382
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
you'd be like, yeah, man, I know.

383
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,000
No bones about it.

384
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,000
That's bad.

385
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,000
You know, like it kind of fits a lot of difference in here.

386
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:01,000
No, this is sausage to me, which also kind of goes with big dog run

387
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:04,000
because them fellows love sausage.

388
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
Let me just say, though, I'm worried.

389
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:16,000
I got worried a little bit that maybe the insurrectionist terrorists had listened to our program

390
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:20,000
and thought like, here comes, this is our brand of big dog run energy.

391
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,000
I don't know about you guys.

392
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:27,000
I was scanning that crowd looking for, well, it would be big dog brand merchandise.

393
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:34,000
Just cause if that would be a, that would I feel like be a week two re-arrange-o of the catchphrase.

394
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:38,000
I think we can all agree, though, that was like little yappy dog energy, right?

395
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,000
That's not big dog energy.

396
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
That was fucking Ted Cruz energy.

397
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,000
That's the opposite.

398
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
Ted Cruz is a little yappy dog.

399
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:48,000
And listen, before you tweet us, I love little yappy dogs.

400
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:51,000
I'm talking about stereotypical little yappy dog behavior.

401
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,000
You know what I mean?

402
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:55,000
That Ted Cruz, he's a little yappy dog.

403
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,000
I could talk about how much I hate Ted Cruz all day long.

404
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,000
Please do.

405
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,000
Okay.

406
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:03,000
Well, you see the thing about it is he's got this clinical case of dick face.

407
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,000
I see his face.

408
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,000
I just want to punch it.

409
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:13,000
I would never do that because I'm a law abiding citizen of these great United States.

410
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:22,000
And I'll continue to just wish him ill from afar like a great American citizen and try to convince Griffin to vote against him one of these days.

411
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
Well, I'll get you one day, won't I, Griff?

412
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,000
Are you kidding me?

413
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:29,000
You know I voted for fucking cool ass skateboard, Beto.

414
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,000
Griffin's a Beto male and you know that.

415
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:34,000
I'm a Beto cuck and I love that shit.

416
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:39,000
It's just like when I see Ted Theodore up there and he's doing his thing and he's like,

417
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:47,000
and these Antifa, like he's up there and he's talking about how Antifa wants to come and take away all your guns and babies.

418
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:51,000
And I think like, it's like he's not even thinking about what I want.

419
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,000
He represents my interests.

420
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:56,000
He thinks like Griffin's going to love this shit.

421
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,000
It's no.

422
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,000
It sucks.

423
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:02,000
Ted Cruz is like, if there was a character in Star Wars who like worked for the Emperor,

424
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:05,000
that the Emperor was constantly like kind of slapping around.

425
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:11,000
But then the next day also that character showed up and was like dressing like the Emperor and kind of like now doing,

426
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:15,000
he is talking like the Emperor and the Emperor is like, I still don't like you.

427
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,000
And was still slapping him around.

428
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
Ted Cruz has got this energy.

429
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:24,000
Like if you brought your nine-year-old nephew to TP some people and you got them all hyped up on the drive over and he's like,

430
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,000
you're going to fucking get them, aren't we?

431
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,000
And we're like, yes, we are, Ted.

432
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,000
Let's get these guys.

433
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,000
And then you open the door and push Ted out.

434
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,000
And he ran out.

435
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,000
I'm like, here we go motherfuckers, it's on.

436
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,000
And you drove away.

437
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,000
That's Ted Cruz energy right there.

438
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:38,000
And he's just like TPing like, yeah, we're getting them guys.

439
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,000
This is happening now.

440
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,000
We're getting them.

441
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:44,000
See, he kind of seems to me like if you were planning to TP someone,

442
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:49,000
so he just went ahead five hours early at like 4pm and started doing it.

443
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:52,000
And people were like looking out the window like, what the fuck is going on?

444
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,000
Is there a kid?

445
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,000
What is this guy doing?

446
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,000
We haven't even had dinner yet.

447
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:58,000
Why is he TPing our house now?

448
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,000
I'm getting you.

449
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:03,000
I mean, you're not even making it up to the trees, Ted.

450
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,000
You're not unrolling it first.

451
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:08,000
You're just throwing whole rolls of toilet paper.

452
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:13,000
It's like he bought a black metal t-shirt at Hot Topic on the way to the concert.

453
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:16,000
And then he opens the door like, I love Satan.

454
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,000
Are you guys wild about Satan?

455
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,000
Me too.

456
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,000
He's like a non-nark narc.

457
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:27,000
I also heard, and maybe it's just a rumor, but he pisses his pants on purpose

458
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:30,000
because he likes the warm feeling against his legs.

459
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,000
He does it and then he tries to-

460
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:35,000
They can't come at me for saying that because of First Amendment.

461
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:39,000
He also, I heard he likes to pee his pants and then try to convince other people

462
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:42,000
that they bet him he wouldn't for money.

463
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:45,000
But it's like after the fact and they definitely didn't.

464
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:48,000
Every day, one of his staffers has to put up with that every day.

465
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:52,000
Ted Cruz, Theodore, standing up and saying, yeah, pay up, sucker.

466
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,000
I pissed the front of my pants again.

467
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,000
Yeah.

468
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,000
Yeah, we don't normally like to get political on this show,

469
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:58,000
but what the fuck else are we going to talk about?

470
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,000
I don't know.

471
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,000
I don't understand that it's Ted Cruz.

472
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:06,000
I don't think that that's a fair thing to say that we don't like to get political on the show.

473
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:13,000
Maybe never as explicitly that we do say that Ted Cruz pisses his pants on purpose

474
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,000
because he likes the good warm feeling between his legs.

475
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,000
And to win money from staffers.

476
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,000
And to win money from staffers, right.

477
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:24,000
I heard that he creates Facebook pages for TV shows that have been off the air for 20 years

478
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,000
that only he watched.

479
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,000
And then he gets mad when his friends won't join it,

480
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:32,000
even though they didn't watch the show and nobody's even really sure that it existed.

481
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,000
That's just what I heard.

482
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:37,000
Why won't you guys join my fucking Johnny Bago Facebook page?

483
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,000
Come on, guys.

484
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,000
Come on.

485
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,000
The show had both Jake and the Fat Man.

486
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:42,000
What's not to like?

487
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:45,000
He created one Facebook group that he just titled that one show

488
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,000
that was about a car race across the country.

489
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:50,000
And I think that maybe Nathan Fillion was in it.

490
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,000
It was on Fox for two episodes.

491
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:53,000
And people were like,

492
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:55,000
Ted, you don't even remember the name of the show.

493
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:58,000
And he's like, yeah, but I watched every episode.

494
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,000
Okay.

495
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:01,000
So, yeah, we're going to do some advice.

496
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:02,000
I want to help.

497
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:05,000
God, if we could just help somebody, you know what I mean?

498
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:09,000
Maybe we could like Christmas Carol Ted Cruz.

499
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:10,000
Is there something we could do?

500
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,000
Okay.

501
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:12,000
What?

502
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,000
Okay.

503
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:18,000
What ghost are you going to call them, son?

504
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,000
Oh, I'm ghost of future, baby.

505
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:24,000
I want to shove that fool into an open grave.

506
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:29,000
That was maybe the line crossing.

507
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:32,000
You think that's going to be the one that maybe gets old Travis in trouble?

508
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,000
Yeah.

509
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:34,000
To be clear, government,

510
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,000
Travis was talking about only in the context of

511
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:39,000
if they were in a production of a Christmas Carol together.

512
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:42,000
And that was the stage directions.

513
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,000
No, no, no.

514
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:47,000
Travis, he wants to push you into an open grave

515
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:51,000
because he was about to fall into a much deeper open grave right next to it.

516
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:55,000
He was on fire and there were three inches of water at the bottom of the open grave.

517
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:56,000
Yes.

518
00:24:56,000 --> 00:25:01,000
Travis is dressed up as the Grim Reaper and the director's like,

519
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:04,000
all right, now push Ted Cruz into the grave, your co-star.

520
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:07,000
And then Travis is like, I don't know if that's such a good idea.

521
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:10,000
He's in government.

522
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,000
And he smells like old piss.

523
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:15,000
But Ted Cruz says it's okay to do it.

524
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:18,000
Yeah, that's what I meant.

525
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:23,000
I worry we might lose some people.

526
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:27,000
Well, if we haven't lost him by this point, just in good riddance, folks.

527
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:29,000
No, you'd fucking think that.

528
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:32,000
But every time I tweet, there's always one person who's like,

529
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:35,000
listen, I've stood by you guys for 10 years, but this is just too far.

530
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:36,000
Hey, listen.

531
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,000
What show have you been listening to?

532
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:41,000
The statement Ted Cruz pisses his pants on purpose

533
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:44,000
because he likes the wet, warm feeling between his legs

534
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:48,000
is about as bipartisan as it gets.

535
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:53,000
Listen, if Joe Biden got up on inauguration day and led with that,

536
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:56,000
full across the aisle support.

537
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,000
Yep, that's the unity that we need right now.

538
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:01,000
Hey, State of the Union, it's me, Joe Biden.

539
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:06,000
Can we all agree that we heard Ted Cruz pisses his pants

540
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:10,000
to feel the warm feeling on his legs and cheers!

541
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:14,000
There would be everyone's on their feet except Ted Cruz.

542
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,000
Yeah, because it's embarrassing stain.

543
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:19,000
Do you guys think we could be sued?

544
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:27,000
Could we be sued for making a t-shirt with all proceeds donated to a charitable cause?

545
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:31,000
Could we be sued for making a t-shirt that says Ted Cruz likes to piss his pants

546
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:33,000
because he loves the warm feeling between his legs?

547
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:37,000
Because the only thing that you could say is that's slander or libel.

548
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:40,000
Well, Justin, all we do is it has to start with...

549
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:43,000
That would require him to, in a court of law, say,

550
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:46,000
I actually don't like the warm feeling between my legs.

551
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,000
It's unpleasant what I pee with.

552
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:53,000
No, when I pee my pants, it is on accident and I do not enjoy it.

553
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:56,000
Okay, if it says when Ted Cruz pees his pants,

554
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:59,000
he likes the warm feeling between his legs.

555
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:02,000
And then if he takes us to court of law, the judge will say,

556
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,000
all right, piss your pants, Theodore.

557
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:05,000
Demonstrate.

558
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:07,000
And then tell us if you like it or not.

559
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:11,000
The shirt could also say, I heard Ted Cruz likes to piss his pants.

560
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:15,000
And then if he's like, I don't like to piss my pants to feel the warm feeling on my leg,

561
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:18,000
then you say, listen, Ted, just what I heard.

562
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:19,000
Just what I heard.

563
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:21,000
And when someone says, where did you hear it?

564
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:23,000
You say, well, it came out of my own mouth.

565
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:24,000
And then I heard it with my ears.

566
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:25,000
There it is.

567
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:28,000
Maybe we print it on the inside of a shirt.

568
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:29,000
Okay.

569
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:30,000
Yeah.

570
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:31,000
Here's what we do.

571
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:32,000
We put the word doesn't,

572
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:35,000
but it's only in heat reactive letters that you can't see.

573
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:36,000
Yeah, that's good.

574
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,000
And then when people are like, I'm going to sue you, you say,

575
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,000
hold on right there, and you take an iron.

576
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:43,000
Let me take you to the club where the black lights shall reveal.

577
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:46,000
All right.

578
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:49,000
I actually just got an email from this week's sponsors,

579
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:53,000
and they said, thank you so much for choosing this episode to feature our products in.

580
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:55,000
Oh, you're so welcome.

581
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:57,000
We're so excited to have this be the one.

582
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:04,000
Let me check, sorry, real quick check of my replies.

583
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:05,000
No.

584
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:06,000
Okay.

585
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:07,000
Nothing yet.

586
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:08,000
Nothing yet.

587
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:09,000
Okay, cool, cool, cool.

588
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:13,000
I expected that from delivery, but not Dijona.

589
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:14,000
That's pretty good.

590
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:15,000
Should we go to the magazine?

591
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:16,000
Sure.

592
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,000
We've helped so many people already.

593
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:18,000
Why not take a break?

594
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,000
We can do a question if you want, just to cleanse the palette,

595
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:23,000
or we can come back with a cleansed palette and help some people out.

596
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:28,000
Yeah, how about before we do go to our sponsors this week, we do it.

597
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:29,000
Just a quick Yahoo.

598
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:31,000
I got a lot of really good ones this week, and I'm very excited.

599
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:34,000
In fact, it's another thing I hate Ted Cruz about,

600
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:38,000
is that he occupied a lot of good Yahoo jokes time.

601
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,000
This one was sent in by Graham Robach.

602
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:41,000
Thanks, Graham.

603
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:42,000
It's Yahoo Answers User.

604
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:45,000
They're anonymous.

605
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:48,000
Jed Cruz asks,

606
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:53,000
ideas for celebrating 13-year-old's first monster energy.

607
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:54,000
Huh.

608
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:58,000
My son Jackson bought his first monster today,

609
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:02,000
and he promised me he wouldn't drink it before I could throw together a party.

610
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:03,000
What should I do for the party?

611
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:04,000
So proud.

612
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:05,000
Huge.

613
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:14,000
This one rides the line of, is it one of those fucking Shrek trolls again?

614
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:18,000
But after this past week, I feel like there's probably some people out there

615
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:24,000
who would celebrate their 13-year-old son Jackson, spelled J-A-X-S-U-N's,

616
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:28,000
first monster energy he bought with his own allowance, 13 years old.

617
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:31,000
I'll tell you, of all the reasons to violate COVID protocols,

618
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:35,000
I think throwing a monster energy party is probably the worst one.

619
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:36,000
Yeah.

620
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:37,000
I don't know.

621
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:41,000
I think maybe St. Peter might like hearing a new one, you know?

622
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:43,000
Yeah, just a new, oh, for monster energy.

623
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:44,000
Oh, really?

624
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:45,000
Huh.

625
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:46,000
A party for it.

626
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:47,000
Okay.

627
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:50,000
I would make the point that you don't want monster energy

628
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,000
to be the last thing you tasted.

629
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:55,000
It's got to make it something good at least.

630
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:56,000
Yeah.

631
00:29:56,000 --> 00:30:00,000
I think that it's all about the ceremony of the flavors.

632
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:06,000
I think he's going to be tempted to, the first time it crosses his lips

633
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:12,000
and he feels the sort of hot burning of real energy.

634
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:13,000
It's so hot.

635
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:16,000
The energy comes in fucking so hot.

636
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,000
He's going to be tempted to bail.

637
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:19,000
Yeah.

638
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:22,000
And I think you need enough peer pressure in the room that he can't.

639
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:26,000
And after he finishes the can, I think one really important thing to do

640
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:29,000
is to pull up a whole case of it.

641
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:31,000
After that, oh, you're so tough.

642
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:32,000
Yeah.

643
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:33,000
You think you're so cool and tough.

644
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:35,000
And make him smoke the whole case.

645
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:37,000
Yeah, you make him smoke the whole case of monster energy.

646
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:38,000
Yeah.

647
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,000
Monster energy's flavors are not as fun and exciting

648
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,000
as I hoped that they would be.

649
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:48,000
Like I hoped there would be one that was like psycho strawberry and fucking.

650
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:49,000
Oh wait, nevermind.

651
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:50,000
I was looking at the wrong part of the website.

652
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,000
They definitely are pretty out there.

653
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,000
Can you give me a sampling?

654
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,000
I mean, oh my.

655
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,000
Uh oh.

656
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:58,000
Uh oh.

657
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:59,000
Uh oh.

658
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:01,000
There's a camo one.

659
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:06,000
There's a camo can and it's got the usual monster stuff in it, I guess.

660
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:09,000
But it is, oh, it's classic cola plus monster.

661
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:12,000
It's monster assault.

662
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,000
And then this is on the website.

663
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,000
At Monster, we don't get too hung up on politics.

664
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:20,000
We're not for the war against the war or any war for that matter.

665
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,000
Cool shit, Monster.

666
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:26,000
You're not for the war against the war or any war.

667
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:29,000
We'll leave the politics to the politicians to keep doing what we do best.

668
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:31,000
Make the meanest energy drinks on the planet.

669
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:33,000
Declare war on the ordinary.

670
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:36,000
Yikes, I don't know.

671
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:39,000
Grab a monster assault and viva la revolution.

672
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:41,000
It says this on the website.

673
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:44,000
Monster, you need to update your shit.

674
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:48,000
You gotta update it.

675
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:52,000
What I would recommend for the party is to just do the traditional kind of thing

676
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:56,000
where you put the can of monster energy on one side

677
00:31:56,000 --> 00:32:02,000
and then you get lines of warriors with pain sticks on either side

678
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:07,000
and as Jackson moves down, he gets shocked by the pain sticks as he chants,

679
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:09,000
today I'm a warrior.

680
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:11,000
I must show you my heart.

681
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:13,000
I travel the river of blood.

682
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:16,000
And if you're doing this, you gotta do muscle monster,

683
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,000
the protein chocolate energy shake.

684
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:19,000
Oh, absolutely.

685
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:23,000
And then he reaches the end, he drinks it,

686
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:26,000
and now he has reached the age of ascension.

687
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:30,000
And now he is officially a warrior at that point.

688
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:35,000
What's the point of getting jacked on monster energy energy

689
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:40,000
and fucking punching the side of a hardy so hard that you break the bones in your hand

690
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:44,000
if you're not gonna be super strong from all the chocolate protein energy in it as well?

691
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:47,000
You need the energy, absolutely.

692
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:51,000
You need all this wild energy, but you also need the power to use it.

693
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:53,000
And that's the wisdom.

694
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:55,000
Offer him a choice.

695
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:57,000
Put the muscle energy drink there,

696
00:32:57,000 --> 00:33:01,000
but then also put maybe like the spiritual energy drink there

697
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:03,000
and the emotional energy drink there.

698
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:05,000
And he has to choose between the three of those.

699
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:08,000
No, because it says on the muscle monster thing on the website,

700
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:12,000
not recommended for children, people sensitive to caffeine, pregnant women, or women who are nursing.

701
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:16,000
And we just say, it's another one of the First Amendment things.

702
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:19,000
It's just another First Amendment thing they're stacking up.

703
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:22,000
You know where it doesn't say that is over on the page for M-Hydro?

704
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:23,000
Oh.

705
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:26,000
You know how water fucking sucks?

706
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:27,000
Water fucking sucks, dude.

707
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:29,000
I drink it and I'm still as tired as I was before.

708
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:31,000
Here's what it says on the website.

709
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:34,000
Water world, 70% of Earth is covered in water.

710
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:35,000
It just says that?

711
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:36,000
It just says water world?

712
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:41,000
Tell me that this copywriter had a word count they had to hit.

713
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:43,000
This is what it says.

714
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:47,000
Water world, 70% of the Earth is covered with water.

715
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:54,000
You got bottled water from mountains, glaciers, virgin springs, tropical islands, and the Arctic.

716
00:33:54,000 --> 00:34:03,000
There's mineralized, fortified, ionized, electrified, pH balanced, triple filtered, and straight out of the city tap.

717
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:05,000
What's the point?

718
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:09,000
You got to hydrate every day, so you might as well enjoy a boost while you're at it.

719
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:16,000
Monster Hydro, non-carbonated and lightly sweetened with natural flavors to make it thirst quenching and easy drinking.

720
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:23,000
We added just enough of that monster magic, by which we mean monster we put in water, to get you fired up.

721
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:26,000
Here's some flavors, and one of them is called Red Dog.

722
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:27,000
Oh boy.

723
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:29,000
And the next one's called Blue Stream.

724
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:31,000
I'm getting so thirsty over here.

725
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:39,000
You know, I would like this same energy and copywriting to be put towards like sleep aids.

726
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:43,000
That's just like, hey man, are you ready to sleep like a Viking?

727
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:44,000
Huh?

728
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:47,000
You want to crash at the end of the day like a lightning bolt hitting a tree?

729
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:50,000
Well, then you need to get Big Dog Slumber.

730
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:55,000
History tells us that Vikings like to sleep on a floating bed of sticks that was on fire.

731
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:57,000
Well, actually that's not, they are not asleep.

732
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:59,000
Why did you think they're asleep?

733
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:00,000
You can too.

734
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:03,000
With a fucking monster bed fire.

735
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:05,000
Melatonin Valhalla.

736
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:07,000
It's a, no, it's a ritual.

737
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:08,000
They're not asleep.

738
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:10,000
Did you think they were asleep?

739
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:11,000
Certainly not.

740
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:13,000
Did you know that Vikings didn't even wear horns on their helmet?

741
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:17,000
Now, take the sleep pill and have a good night's sleep, little baby.

742
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:20,000
Did you know every Viking owns 16 axes?

743
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,000
It's true.

744
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:25,000
Now, take a little nap, sleepy boy.

745
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:30,000
How would you like to have the most visceral nightmare you've ever had in your life?

746
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:34,000
The drink is literally called Monster.

747
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:42,000
Oh gosh.

748
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,000
Okay, well let's take a quick break and we're going to go to the Money Zone.

749
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:49,000
This week's sponsor is of course Monster Energy, who I have recently realized in the past few minutes,

750
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:52,000
we've likely alienated as a potential future sponsor.

751
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:55,000
But did you hear me talk about Monster Assault Energy?

752
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:57,000
I don't know that I love that brand.

753
00:35:57,000 --> 00:36:02,000
We are calling on Monster Energy to change their assault branding.

754
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:22,000
All right.

755
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:25,000
Griffin, I would like to issue you a challenge.

756
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:30,000
I want you to pretend that I'm an alien who's landed on Earth and I have no idea what socks are

757
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,000
and I want you to describe them to me.

758
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:34,000
Soft shoes inside.

759
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:37,000
What are shoes?

760
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:39,000
Is this the alien?

761
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:42,000
I'm alien Borg Borg.

762
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,000
Borg Borg.

763
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:46,000
Borg Borg, please.

764
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:48,000
Borg Borg feet, you got them?

765
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,000
I have 18 feet.

766
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:54,000
Okay, do you cover them or do you just walk around on your spaceship or whatever?

767
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,000
I cover them with foot condoms.

768
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,000
Yeah, that sucks, pal.

769
00:36:58,000 --> 00:36:59,000
Gross.

770
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:02,000
No, they're really good and soft and they feel good.

771
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:06,000
Yours also made of alluvium skin?

772
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:10,000
No, they're made out of really comfortable stuff.

773
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:12,000
I mean, I'm talking about Bombas socks.

774
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:14,000
I've worn shitty socks.

775
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:15,000
Oh, Bombas?

776
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:16,000
Why the fuck didn't you just say that?

777
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:17,000
All right.

778
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:19,000
Yeah, I didn't know because you didn't know what shoes were,

779
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:21,000
so I assume you didn't know what this brand was.

780
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:26,000
But everybody knows how comfortable and wonderful Bombas socks are.

781
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,000
You asked me what socks were.

782
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:29,000
Why did you waste my time?

783
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:31,000
Hey, don't be an asshole, man.

784
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:32,000
I'm trying to help you out.

785
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:33,000
All right.

786
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:37,000
Hey, by the way, bud, partner, it's not a good time to visit.

787
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:38,000
Oh, yeah?

788
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:42,000
Yeah, can you, like, it's cool and we've all been waiting for it

789
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:45,000
and like, you know, Arrival and all that shit.

790
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:46,000
Yeah?

791
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:49,000
You know, give us time travel powers or whatever.

792
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:53,000
But can you come back once we sort of got it all sorted?

793
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:55,000
Should I talk to your leader first?

794
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:56,000
No.

795
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:57,000
Fuck no.

796
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:58,000
Hey, listen, Blorp Blorp.

797
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:02,000
No, just go to the moon for like a month or so.

798
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:05,000
It's still going to be, you know, not great in a month or so,

799
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:08,000
but if you could just, we're kind of in it right now, Blorp Blorp.

800
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:11,000
Blorp Blorp, please.

801
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:15,000
Anyway, if you buy a pair of Bombas socks,

802
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:19,000
you also give a pair to people experiencing homelessness,

803
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:25,000
a nice warm and comfortable pair of socks from your friends at Bombas.

804
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:28,000
It's a small comfort that's especially important right now.

805
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:31,000
So if you want, you can give a pair when you buy a pair

806
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:36,000
and get 20% off your first purchase at bombas.com slash my brother.

807
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:42,000
That's B-O-M-B-A-S.com slash my brother for 20% off your first purchase.

808
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:45,000
Bombas.com slash my brother.

809
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:47,000
I am still here, Oldest Brother Justin.

810
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:50,000
Tell me, what is a Brooklinen?

811
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:51,000
Don't, it's a trap.

812
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:53,000
He knows, he fucking knows.

813
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:57,000
A sheet for a bead?

814
00:38:57,000 --> 00:39:01,000
Well, you're mispronouncing it, but you got the idea.

815
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:04,000
Not just any sheets there, Bleep Blorp, but fantastic sheets.

816
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:06,000
It's Blorp Blorp, please.

817
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:07,000
Yeah, I'm sorry about that.

818
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:08,000
I apologize.

819
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:10,000
Bleep Blorp was my father.

820
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:12,000
I mainly know human names.

821
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:15,000
Oh, they're pretty close-minded of you.

822
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:17,000
I love this character, Brooklinen.

823
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:20,000
All my ads are going to be so fucking cool.

824
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:21,000
I'm not going anywhere.

825
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:24,000
I'm any sexy, too.

826
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,000
What do you look like, Blorp Blorp?

827
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:29,000
I got 18 legs and six-pack abs.

828
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:33,000
The math on that doesn't exactly track with aesthetic pleasure.

829
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:35,000
I've got four boobs.

830
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:39,000
Brooklinen works directly with manufacturers.

831
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:43,000
Blorp Blorp, you're making me wish I had six hands.

832
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:46,000
The other two are to choke you to death.

833
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,000
Oh no, my beautiful swan-like neck.

834
00:39:48,000 --> 00:40:11,000
Brooklinen works directly with manufacturers to make luxury available directly to you without the luxury-level markups.

835
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:16,000
They've got a variety of sheets, colors, patterns, and materials to fit your needs and tastes.

836
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:19,000
Even my needs and tastes?

837
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:24,000
Brooklinen is also notoriously forgiving for podcasts.

838
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:29,000
Don't get mad at them when they talk about things that are not directly sheet-related.

839
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:33,000
But Blorp Blorp, you're going to love these sheets if you haven't tried sheets yet.

840
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:35,000
They're still going to be the best ones you'll ever have.

841
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:36,000
Oh, I've tried sheets.

842
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:39,000
I've got Brooklinen sheets and comforters and pillows and towels.

843
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:40,000
I fucking told you.

844
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:42,000
Even loungewear.

845
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:43,000
It's 2021.

846
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:46,000
Have something nice for yourself to start the new year.

847
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:48,000
To help you do that, Brooklinen has a special offer.

848
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:55,000

Hi, I'm Jo Firestone.

852
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:16,000
And I'm Manolo Moreno.

853
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:25,000
And we host Dr. Game Show, a podcast where listeners submit games and we play them regardless of quality with a dozen listeners from around the world.

854
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:31,000
We've had folks call in from as far as Sweden, South Africa, and the Philippines.

855
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:32,000
Here's an example.

856
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:41,000
This is a game we've played called Cotton Candy Chicken Nuggets, where you have to sing any eight syllable phrase to the tune of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.

857
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:43,000
You have an example, Manolo?

858
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:44,000
Yeah, here's one.

859
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:47,000
Little baby turkey turnips.

860
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:48,000
Oh, nice.

861
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:49,000
Thanks.

862
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:53,000
Dr. Game Show has new episodes every other Wednesday on Maximum Fun.

863
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:55,000
Check us out.

864
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:57,000
Please.

865
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:05,000
B-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-update.

866
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:08,000
Real quick breaking update.

867
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:17,000
We still have not gotten any responses from the pizza chains, but I do think there's a reason for that.

868
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:23,000
As a couple of people pointed out in my Twitter responses, Hida Shura was the first, I believe.

869
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:28,000
There hasn't been a lot of tweeting going on actually from these particular brands.

870
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:31,000
Let's check and see when their last tweets were.

871
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:33,000
Domino's, January 6th.

872
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:36,000
In the morning time?

873
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:39,000
Marco's Pizza, January 6th.

874
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:43,000
Papa John's last tweet there was January 5th.

875
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:47,000
I don't think Papa John's gonna be on the right side of history.

876
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:49,000
Well, they got Shaq in there now.

877
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:50,000
I don't know.

878
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:53,000
Pizza Hut's last tweet was on January 5th.

879
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:55,000
I'm noticing a pattern for sure.

880
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:58,000
Little Caesar's last tweet was January 5th.

881
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:03,000
It's taken them a long time to figure out how did you announce the violence at our nation's capital, huh?

882
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:08,000
It took them a real long time. DiGiorno, January 5th.

883
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:17,000
None of the brands have tweeted since the events of January 6th and the failed coup attempt on our nation.

884
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:19,000
Except for one brand.

885
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:20,000
Who?

886
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:27,000
That had the guts to speak up after these shameful, shameful attacks on our democracy.

887
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:30,000
And it's Charles E. Cheese.

888
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:32,000
Charles Entertainment Cheese. You're telling the me.

889
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:35,000
So wait, so what was that Griff? Charles Entertainment Cheese. Interesting.

890
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:38,000
Okay, January 8th.

891
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:42,000
Have you ever wondered what the E in Chuck E. Cheese stands for?

892
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:44,000
So have we.

893
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:54,000
Join Chuck E.'s friends as they go on the game show, Championship Chuck E. Challenge, to guess Chuck E.'s middle name.

894
00:43:54,000 --> 00:44:01,000
And then there's a video that's four minutes long of puppets talking about Chuck E. Cheese and that was tweeted on January 8th.

895
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:05,000
Okay. Not great.

896
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:09,000
Not great also because it's entertainment and everybody fucking knows it.

897
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:10,000
Everybody fucking does know that.

898
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:12,000
You know what, Justin? If it helps.

899
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:16,000
This wasn't a response to the failed coup at our nation's capital.

900
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:21,000
But on the third, we could pretend like this tweet isn't a response to that.

901
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:24,000
We're bummed to hear your experience wasn't what you had hoped for.

902
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:28,000
We'd like to let our guest relations team know about your experience.

903
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:32,000
Message us with your name, phone number, email, store location, and visit date, please.

904
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:34,000
So that's not bad.

905
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:36,000
That was tweeted to Blork Blork.

906
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:38,000
That was tweeted at Q&A.

907
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:39,000
Yeah.

908
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:40,000
Oh no!

909
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:44,000
But they were working with the FBI, Griffin. It was a sting operation.

910
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:45,000
Yeah.

911
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:46,000
We didn't watch the video.

912
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:50,000
Maybe at some point during the Charles Entertainment Cheese puppet video, they're like,

913
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:59,000
let's explain how these accusations of voter fraud are historically mired in white supremacy and let's just all unpack that right now.

914
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:01,000
It doesn't end with Trump.

915
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:06,000
Maybe there is a very thoughtful discussion of that because everybody knows the dude's middle fucking name.

916
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:08,000
Equality.

917
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:09,000
Yeah.

918
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:10,000
It's not.

919
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:11,000
It's Charles Equality Cheese.

920
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:13,000
Wait, what were you going to say?

921
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:21,000
What I'm going to say is I'm really excited to read the Splitsider article about this episode,

922
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:25,000
or perhaps the AV Club will get this one where they're like, I can't believe they did it.

923
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:27,000
A lot of people thought they couldn't do it.

924
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:34,000
They couldn't thread the needle and make an episode in the wake of the failed coup on our nation.

925
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:36,000
But they did it.

926
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:39,000
The boys had the perfect tone throughout the entire episode.

927
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:42,000
You almost forgot the kind of tumultuous landscape.

928
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:46,000
We were living in as they whisked us away to entertainment town.

929
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:48,000
But not in an escapist way.

930
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:49,000
You know what I mean?

931
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:50,000
Like it still kept you grounded.

932
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:51,000
They fixed it all.

933
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:54,000
Well, they didn't fix it because that would have been disingenuous.

934
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:56,000
Now they had the perfect balance.

935
00:45:56,000 --> 00:46:03,000
Hey Griffin, what do you think was the most effective thing about this episode so far and how it's dealt with the ongoing strife in our nation?

936
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:11,000
I think it's probably when we talked about the fact that isn't it silly that Chuck E Cheese did a funny video right after the thing happened.

937
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:16,000
But also that's what we're doing right now.

938
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:17,000
Not really.

939
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:19,000
Not exactly the same.

940
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:20,000
It was kind of.

941
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:21,000
A bit the same.

942
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:23,000
But we're at least mentioning it.

943
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:24,000
Yeah.

944
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:25,000
Yeah.

945
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:26,000
And we're talking about it.

946
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:27,000
And we are taking something to the stand.

947
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:29,000
But we don't have Skee-Ball.

948
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:31,000
We don't have Skee-Ball.

949
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:32,000
You're right.

950
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:33,000
We don't have Skee-Ball.

951
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:34,000
So it pretty much balances out.

952
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:38,000
We're taking a stand and Chuck E Quality Cheese has Skee-Ball.

953
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:40,000
So it's balanced at this point.

954
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:41,000
Yes.

955
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:42,000
I just don't know.

956
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:43,000
We didn't know what to say.

957
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:44,000
I don't know what to say.

958
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:45,000
I don't know if it's appropriate.

959
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:46,000
We've talked about this.

960
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:48,000
When is a good time?

961
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:55,000
We don't want to be a distraction from the important things going on because I think it's important to pay attention and to act.

962
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:56,000
What's that address again, Griff?

963
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:58,000
The URL that people should go to right now?

964
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:00,000
Number5Calls.org.

965
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:01,000
5Calls.org.

966
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:03,000
You should go there and do something.

967
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:08,000
But at the same time, there's not going to be a cool time to do jokes.

968
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:10,000
Hopefully in the future.

969
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:11,000
I hope.

970
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:13,000
This is a wild suggestion, right?

971
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:15,000
This might be completely out of that field for us.

972
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:17,000
It's not something we normally do.

973
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:22,000
But maybe we could answer a question from somebody for advice.

974
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:29,000
I know this may sound peculiar, but I'm wondering how to find a child, preferably more than one.

975
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:30,000
That's the end of the question.

976
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:31,000
No, no, no.

977
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:32,000
Okay, then go on.

978
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:33,000
Sorry, there's more.

979
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:34,000
I missed it.

980
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:35,000
There's more.

981
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:37,000
To read my middle grade sci-fi novel.

982
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:39,000
That must be, maybe it's a British thing.

983
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:40,000
Who knows?

984
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:41,000
Middle grade.

985
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:43,000
Maybe it's for middle school.

986
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:45,000
No, I use context clues to figure it out.

987
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:47,000
I'm just trying to figure out who says middle grade.

988
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:50,000
Anyway, I've just finished my first book, and I would like a kid's opinion.

989
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:52,000
Unfortunately, I'm 25, and none of my friends...

990
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:54,000
Man, I wish I was 25.

991
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:56,000
You are a kid.

992
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:59,000
And none of my friends are old enough yet to have kids in middle school.

993
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:02,000
I don't have any younger siblings or cousins I can poach either.

994
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:04,000
When my fellow adults read it, the reactions were good,

995
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:06,000
but their opinions, while nice, are not the most important ones.

996
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:08,000
I'm willing to pay said kids for their time,

997
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:12,000
but asking to rent a child seems like a tricky subject to broach with a stranger.

998
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:13,000
Yup.

999
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:17,000
How do I find children who can tell me ways to improve my writing?

1000
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:18,000
And that's from Jamie.

1001
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:20,000
And here's my advice, Jamie.

1002
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:22,000
Maybe you could upload it to Fortnite.

1003
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:24,000
No, that's not bad.

1004
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:27,000
Do they do books in Fortnite?

1005
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:31,000
Yeah, when you're hiding from other people trying to dance on you or whatever,

1006
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:35,000
they're like, do you want a book?

1007
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:38,000
Yeah, they leave them around like a doctor's office.

1008
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:41,000
You just pick up a manuscript, leaf through that real quick.

1009
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:43,000
Oh, laser fight.

1010
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:46,000
Oh no, he flossed me, or whatever.

1011
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:47,000
Yeah, okay.

1012
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:49,000
I think I follow.

1013
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:50,000
You know, another one.

1014
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:54,000
You could just loiter around a park.

1015
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:55,000
No, no.

1016
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:56,000
You know what?

1017
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:57,000
Never mind.

1018
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:58,000
There's no way.

1019
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:01,000
Let's rule out physical, in-person.

1020
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:03,000
I mean, there's an ongoing pandemic also.

1021
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:05,000
It's another thing to keep in mind.

1022
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:06,000
I think purely digital strategies.

1023
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:13,000
And so far, I think it's going to be difficult to beat Fortnite.

1024
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:14,000
What's the one?

1025
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:19,000
You know, I think it is unfair that the website is called AO3,

1026
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:23,000
and there's also a very well-known person named AOC,

1027
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:26,000
because I have a really hard time separating those two,

1028
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:29,000
and I always want to say you could upload your story to AOC,

1029
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:31,000
and then it would be completely different.

1030
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:34,000
But she might give you some good feedback.

1031
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:36,000
Yeah, and she could maybe signal blast it

1032
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:39,000
to some of her middle school-aged followers.

1033
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:41,000
Maybe, if she has those.

1034
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:43,000
I assume she probably does.

1035
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:44,000
She probably does.

1036
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:46,000
She's a big influence on the younger generation.

1037
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:48,000
I had to...

1038
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:52,000
In middle school, I had to read grown-up books.

1039
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:53,000
Uh-huh.

1040
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:56,000
I had to read Red Badge of Courage.

1041
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:58,000
Yeah, classic grown-up book.

1042
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:00,000
I had to read...

1043
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:02,000
Call of the Wild.

1044
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:04,000
I had to read Hatchet.

1045
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:05,000
No.

1046
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:08,000
You've got to read grown-up old-ass books,

1047
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:10,000
so I don't see why...

1048
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:12,000
I fucking read a good Earth.

1049
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:15,000
I read ordinary fucking people in middle school.

1050
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:19,000
I just think that good literature is good,

1051
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:21,000
and so you don't need a kid's seal of approval.

1052
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:25,000
If kids can read grown-up books,

1053
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:27,000
I guess we can't read teen books, huh?

1054
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:29,000
Well, Griffin, you have your money or something.

1055
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:33,000
Hey, Jamie, kids don't scot some money.

1056
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:34,000
You're selling it to grown-ups.

1057
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:36,000
Grown-ups are buying it for their middle school kids.

1058
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:38,000
If your grown-up friends like it,

1059
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:41,000
put on the cover some space aliens and laser gun fight,

1060
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:43,000
but also they're reading books and respecting their parents.

1061
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:44,000
But it's the parents.

1062
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:46,000
Yeah, it's the parents who are getting it,

1063
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:48,000
so you need a character on the front of the book

1064
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:52,000
who is respectful and doing homework

1065
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:58,000
and will sit still for video calls with Uncle Shaq.

1066
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:00,000
Whoa, that dude just came out.

1067
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:02,000
You know, we're sitting here talking about

1068
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:03,000
the importance of reading for young people,

1069
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:04,000
and gosh, it is so important.

1070
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:05,000
Are we?

1071
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:08,000
I'm sitting here very reminded of when...

1072
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:09,000
Griffin was talking about the boring adult buzz

1073
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:11,000
he had to read, and it reminded me of

1074
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:12,000
when I was in elementary school,

1075
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:14,000
there was this program where you got points.

1076
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:15,000
Oh, yeah, Accelerated Reader.

1077
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:17,000
Book it. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1078
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:19,000
No, not book it. That's for fucking pizzas.

1079
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:21,000
You got pizza points, though.

1080
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:22,000
Accelerated Reader was this program in school

1081
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:24,000
where you read books and you get points for it.

1082
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:25,000
Accelerated Reader program.

1083
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:29,000
And I was just recalling how if your parents read books,

1084
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:31,000
they could get points for you as well.

1085
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:32,000
What? Really?

1086
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:36,000
I remember Dad reading The Virginian to get points,

1087
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:39,000
and then he had to do a quiz

1088
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:41,000
where he answered questions about The Virginian.

1089
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:43,000
And I'm sitting here thinking about that now

1090
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:44,000
as a 40-year-old man.

1091
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:46,000
I'm thinking, how the fuck did that help me?

1092
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:47,000
Hey, Justin?

1093
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:48,000
I don't understand what I gleaned from that.

1094
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:51,000
Is that real, or was Dad cheating for you?

1095
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:54,000
No, Dad was... I mean, this was in person.

1096
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:55,000
He had to go in.

1097
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:59,000
He came down to the school to take a test on The Virginian?

1098
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:00,000
It was pre-COVID.

1099
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:02,000
Of course it was pre-COVID, Justin.

1100
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:04,000
That's the part I'm worried about.

1101
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:06,000
Travis, we did things a little differently back then.

1102
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:08,000
A little differently back then.

1103
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:12,000
I remember Accelerated Reader, it showed you the points,

1104
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:16,000
how many points you could get based on the boringness

1105
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:19,000
of the book, basically, is essentially what it was.

1106
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:22,000
And I loved running the arithmetic in my head

1107
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:24,000
that I could read Last of the Mohicans,

1108
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:27,000
or for an equal number of points,

1109
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:29,000
I could read 12 anamorphs.

1110
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:33,000
I think I'll go for 12 anamorphs this time.

1111
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:35,000
Mr. Fenimore Cooper, catch you next time.

1112
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:39,000
I won Accelerated Reader by reading the Bible,

1113
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:44,000
and I aced it, aced that test, which I wasn't expecting,

1114
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:47,000
but now I can tell you every word of the Bible to this day.

1115
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:48,000
That's true, Travis knows it.

1116
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:52,000
Travis, give me, what's John 3.15?

1117
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:55,000
It's, hey, wait for this great one.

1118
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:58,000
This next one's gonna be a real humdinger.

1119
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:04,000
It says, it says, hold onto your asses,

1120
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:06,000
I'm about to blow them away.

1121
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:08,000
It actually says, one, two, one, two,

1122
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:10,000
here comes the new shit.

1123
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:14,000
And it actually says, DJ Khaled, we the best music,

1124
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:16,000
which is bizarre to me.

1125
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:18,000
It says, back me up, Pitbull, which is weird.

1126
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:21,000
Which is weird, because Pitbull's not even in the Bible much.

1127
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:22,000
Well, not much.

1128
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:24,000
It says, my name is Jesus, and I'm here to say,

1129
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:28,000
and that just stops, there.

1130
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:31,000
It says, listen to this joke I'm about to make.

1131
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:32,000
Oh, no.

1132
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:37,000
Hey, this one's not, this next one's made up.

1133
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:42,000
Hey, it's opposite day.

1134
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:46,000
Here's some dope shit my Uncle Kevin told me.

1135
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:47,000
John 3.15.

1136
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:50,000
John 3.17 is psych.

1137
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:55,000
John 3.15 and John 3.17 are actually both get-or-done.

1138
00:53:55,000 --> 00:54:03,000
A lot of people don't know that.

1139
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:05,000
It's all gonna be fun.

1140
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:07,000
Thank you so much for listening to our podcast,

1141
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:09,000
my brother, my brother and me.

1142
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:10,000
We did our best.

1143
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:11,000
I don't know.

1144
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:12,000
We're all hanging in there.

1145
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:13,000
We're all hanging in there.

1146
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:14,000
We don't know.

1147
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:15,000
You don't know.

1148
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:16,000
You know what?

1149
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:17,000
Here is a weird thing.

1150
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:19,000
You're listening to this on Tuesday.

1151
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:20,000
We're recording this on Monday.

1152
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:24,000
You are infinitely smarter about the world than we are currently.

1153
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:27,000
It's kind of like that thing where it's like you get one penny every day,

1154
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:30,000
but then you double it, and how much do you have at the end?

1155
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:34,000
Every day, the world's entirety of knowledge seems to double,

1156
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:36,000
and it's a lot to keep up with.

1157
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:38,000
The Great Gatsby just entered public domain,

1158
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:40,000
so we're gonna be reading all that next week.

1159
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:41,000
We don't normally promo.

1160
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:44,000
Oh, that one's six animorphs.

1161
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:47,000
Hey, thanks to Maximum Fun for having us on the network.

1162
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:48,000
Lots of cool shows there.

1163
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:54,000
Cool shows with jokes, some serious ones, and stories ones.

1164
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:55,000
There you go.

1165
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:57,000
We're all there on MaximumFun.org.

1166
00:54:57,000 --> 00:54:59,000
I do want to say real quick, over at the merch store,

1167
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:01,000
we got a new pin of the month.

1168
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:04,000
It's the three of us as Cerberus,

1169
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:07,000
and those go to benefit the NARAL,

1170
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:09,000
which fights for access to abortion care, birth control,

1171
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:11,000
paid parental leave, and protection

1172
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:13,000
from pregnancy discrimination.

1173
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:14,000
Go check it out.

1174
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:16,000
There's a bunch of other stuff over there too,

1175
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:18,000
mackraymerch.com.

1176
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:20,000
Let's see.

1177
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:21,000
We got a book.

1178
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:23,000
The Sawbones book, the Sawbones paperback,

1179
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:26,000
came out a couple weeks ago.

1180
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:28,000
I'm not gonna keep plugging it every week,

1181
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:30,000
but if you like weird medical history,

1182
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:32,000
we're really proud of it.

1183
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:34,000
It's a new version.

1184
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:36,000
The original hardback had some issues.

1185
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:37,000
This one doesn't.

1186
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:38,000
It's real good.

1187
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:41,000
So please go buy it wherever fine books are sold.

1188
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:44,000
It's like two weeks until our podcast book.

1189
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:46,000
Everybody has a podcast except Pete comes out.

1190
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:48,000
We're having a book launch event for that

1196
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:00,000
signed by one of us.

1197
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:04,000
You can get that at bit.ly slash mackroypodcastbookevent

1198
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:07,000

You're great.

1202
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:14,000
I think you're the bee's knees.

1203
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:15,000

00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:18,000
No bones about it.

1206
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:19,000
You want some final?

1207
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:20,000
Yes, please.

1208
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:22,000
This final Yahoo was sent in by Brett.

1209
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:26,000
It's from Yahoo Answers user question mark.

1210

1211
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:31,000

00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:35,000

1215
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:44,000
This has been My Brother, My Brother.

1216
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:46,000
May you kiss your dad square on the lips.

1217
