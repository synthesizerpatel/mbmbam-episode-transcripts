1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:30,720
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:49,360
Welcome to my brother, my brother, main advice show for the modern era.

6
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:51,600
I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy.

7
00:00:51,600 --> 00:01:00,240
I'm your middle brother, Travis McElroy.

8
00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:09,040
And I'm your sweet baby brother and 30 under 30 media luminary, Griffin McElroy.

9
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:13,280
Did you burp in the middle of your name?

10
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:17,920
I didn't, I didn't burp. I got scared by the sound of my own amplified voice.

11
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:23,200
And this is my brother, a trained capuchin monkey.

12
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:31,280
This, like the Chilean miners, we have reemerged here in the beautiful land of Alabama.

13
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:39,360
I haven't been out here since the 70s. Did some things, us and the Eagles, steely damn.

14
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:43,280
You playing some Candy Crush over there, bud?

15
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:48,160
No, no, no, I'm loading up my notes for the show. I have a lot of notes to mention.

16
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:55,280
So this is a beautiful theater that you people...

17
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:57,120
This is unprecedented.

18
00:01:57,120 --> 00:02:02,880
Unprecedented. And very, very encouraging.

19
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:13,440
You people have managed to purchase exactly 69% of the seats in this theater.

20
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:24,960
Now, thank you for coming out, but also you nasty.

21
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:28,960
You nasty. How the fuck did you guys coordinate that?

22
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:33,440
As an artist who makes their living this way, when we saw...

23
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:37,280
Nice, thank you. Nice, nice, nice, nice. Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry.

24
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:39,040
Nice, nice, nice, nice, nice.

25
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:43,360
As an artist who makes their living this way, obviously when we saw that 60% of the seats were sold,

26
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:45,760
it's kind of like, oh man, that's a bummer.

27
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:48,480
Now when we got to 65 with like three days left, we're like,

28
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:50,960
well, let's all pump the brakes a little bit.

29
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:54,880
Let's not go too wild. Maybe we're gonna... But you don't even want to say it.

30
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:56,720
Right, right. You can't jinx it.

31
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:59,680
You can't jinx it when you're about to throw a perfect game.

32
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:05,360
I have to imagine we got to 69% and then like maybe one of your friends was like,

33
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:08,160
I think I'll go too. And you're like, no! No!

34
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:11,840
You slashed their tires. Stay at home, Jeremy.

35
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:17,920
You should call Jeremy now though and say like, yeah, now come.

36
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:19,120
Listen, things got out of hand.

37
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:22,400
I just waved bye to dad. I realize that's unprofessional now looking back on it.

38
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:24,240
Bye, daddy. Bye, daddy. We love you.

39
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:27,120
Bye, daddy. He doesn't enjoy the show anymore.

40
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:30,800
It's all about the money for Clint now. It's all about the money.

41
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:35,760
We have to pay him an appearance fee. He got his $73 and he is out the door.

42
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:40,720
So this is an advice show. Yes, traditionally.

43
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:43,440
We'll retake your questions and turn them out. We'll be like Into Wisdom.

44
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:50,000
My son loves watching video game speed runs and boss rushes online.

45
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:50,880
Yes. Yeah.

46
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:54,480
Yeah. He loves the games I play. And recently he has started giving me

47
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:59,120
spoilers for these video games by watching boss rushes when I am gone

48
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:02,960
and then telling me what is going to happen while I'm playing them for the first time.

49
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:08,720
How do I avoid spoilers on games I play? When he gets so excited,

50
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:12,400
he watches ahead and has no filter. That's from Befuddled in Bama.

51
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:14,800
Are you here? All right.

52
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:20,560
So your child has become like the embodiment of like a Nintendo helpline,

53
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:23,600
but if the Nintendo helpline called you. Yeah.

54
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:26,720
I was like, hey, is this Steve? Yeah.

55
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:29,520
He has a second form. Oh, no.

56
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:35,040
Your child's YouTube. What's up, fam? This is Dylan coming at you.

57
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:36,880
Please don't say that to me, Dylan. Please.

58
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,080
Just dad is fine. What's up, fam?

59
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:44,640
Yes, I guess I am technically your family. I'm your father. Please.

60
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:47,360
Got all the hot strats for the Into Red Dead Redemption 2.

61
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:48,960
Dylan, no. Dylan, no.

62
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:51,280
No. I'm 20 hours in, Dylan.

63
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:52,960
The horse did it. No.

64
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:54,880
No, Dylan. Damn it.

65
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:58,160
Man, that game's so wild at the end when the horse pulls out a gun.

66
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:02,720
Looks like this is the end of our journey, Red Dead.

67
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:04,000
Yeah. Anyway, fam,

68
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,840
don't forget to smash that like and subscribe button.

69
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:08,720
God damn it, Dylan. Go to bed.

70
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:10,960
Don't forget to support me on Patreon. I bet.

71
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:14,560
Fuck you. I buy you dinner and clothes.

72
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:18,000
I was, Dylan.

73
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:18,560
So.

74
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:22,960
So your son's probably way better than that.

75
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:27,280
Also, you should be letting your son play the video games

76
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:29,040
while you spoil them for him.

77
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:31,040
Maybe you're someone who liked to play,

78
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:34,400
so he's just like, spoiling them for you so you'll lose interest.

79
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:39,040
That's why you gotta get into Fortnite. You can't spoil that.

80
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:41,040
Except unless you tell me, Griffin,

81
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:44,160
you're not gonna understand anything sort of culturally relevant

82
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:45,840
for the next sort of couple of years there.

83
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:47,840
How about a Yahoo answer from the Yahoo Answers?

84
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:52,640
This one was sent in by several people.

85
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:53,920
Thank you, several people.

86
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:55,760
It's an anonymous Yahoo Answers user,

87
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:58,400
who I'm gonna name Percy, who asks,

88
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:04,080
Is it illegal to combine two sauces and sell it as your own creation?

89
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:08,320
Update.

90
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:10,960
Two different sauces.

91
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:14,960
Not much of an update.

92
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:16,880
It's not even a clarification.

93
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:17,440
No.

94
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:19,920
The only additional word is different.

95
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:23,840
Like, yes, you could not combine ketchup and ketchup and call it your own.

96
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:25,360
Update. Two different sauces.

97
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:27,440
Like, for example, you go by Newman's Ranch

98
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:29,280
and combine it with Baby Jane's BBQ

99
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:33,440
and you sell the end result product as your own to a toilet,

100
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:36,400
I'm assuming, is who you would sell that to.

101
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:39,680
Every sauce begins this way.

102
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:41,280
All the great sauces.

103
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:44,160
You take Katsup, for example.

104
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:48,640
That was just tomato sauce and also vinegar

105
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:50,240
that they mixed together to get that.

106
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:52,320
You take mayonnaise.

107
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:54,240
That was egg sauce and oil sauce.

108
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:57,760
They blended together to get mayonnaise.

109
00:06:57,760 --> 00:07:01,920
I can't even eat a hot dog without egg sauce on it.

110
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:04,880
Doesn't that sound like a New England thing?

111
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:06,480
Ah, you gotta get the egg sauce.

112
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:08,000
You gotta get egg sauce on your dog.

113
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,280
Or your nor'ista.

114
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:10,000
Your nor'ista.

115
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,680
You gotta get a good egg sauce.

116
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:12,080
Get some sh...

117
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:12,960
Bastards.

118
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:13,760
Get some...

119
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:14,640
Hey, we're in the South.

120
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:16,480
Let's make fun of the North some more.

121
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:16,980
Yeah!

122
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:20,880
Get a little side of schmutz.

123
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:25,360
What if you were watching, like, Julia Child and she was like,

124
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:28,080
I'm gonna put the oil sauce in the pan?

125
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:28,480
Is that...

126
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:33,280
The really hot plate with the handle on it?

127
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:34,240
I'm gonna put oil sauce in there.

128
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:36,160
You know, on the burn box.

129
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:39,360
You know, you put the oil sauce on the hot plate on the burn box.

130
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:41,440
I'm gonna use square milk.

131
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:42,880
Do you eat butter, Julia?

132
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:48,240
And then I'll put it in my teeth hole.

133
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:49,760
My teeth hole where the teeth live?

134
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:52,340
I...

135
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:56,240
I don't know the answer to this question.

136
00:07:57,280 --> 00:08:01,680
The thing is, is at some point everybody has combined every sauce and called it their own.

137
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:06,240
There is only one true sauce and it's, like, lava.

138
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:09,280
Lava is earth sauce.

139
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:10,880
Earth sauce.

140
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:11,280
The original hot sauce.

141
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:12,880
It's the only natural sauce.

142
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:15,680
It's the only naturally occurring hot sauce.

143
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:15,840
Yeah.

144
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:17,440
The hottest sauce.

145
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:19,040
The very, very hot sauce.

146
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:21,440
Pompeii went up and they were just like, guys, chill.

147
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:22,880
It's just earth sauce.

148
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:23,680
It's just earth.

149
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:24,000
Mmm.

150
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:24,640
It's just earth.

151
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:26,480
This could use something.

152
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:29,840
Earth's slathering us up with its delicious sauce.

153
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:32,480
You would go to jail.

154
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:38,800
I think that Newman and his cohorts would do some DNA testing on it.

155
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:39,200
Right.

156
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:42,400
Send it to 23andMe and say, like, this is our shit.

157
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:44,640
Yeah, throw it into a fucking centrifuge.

158
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:46,720
Yeah, separate out the ranch.

159
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:47,040
Yeah.

160
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:48,880
This came from our ranch.

161
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:58,640
Now what if I so completely stealthed it and I did, like, Heinz mayonnaise with Cool Whip

162
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:00,080
and I combined those together and-

163
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:01,600
And called it bad Cool Whip.

164
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:02,960
Not Cool Whip.

165
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:11,680
What if I said Cool Whip and Miracle Whip and I put them together and I just-

166
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:13,280
And just called it Cool Miracle.

167
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:16,560
I call it simply All Whip.

168
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:22,800
Now I do like the idea of, like, we added ketchup and mustard and Miracle Whip and

169
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:25,840
basically everything we could grab off the shelf and it's called All Sauce.

170
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:28,480
That's called high school cafeteria dare.

171
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:28,880
Yeah.

172
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:32,960
But if I take mayo and mayo and mix it together and I'm saying,

173
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:34,400
this is Griffin's new Good Mayo.

174
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:38,400
It has all the best parts of Heinz Mayonnaise and also Miracle Whip,

175
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:41,200
and they're never going to know because I won't say that last part.

176
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:43,840
This is like, but this is every sauce.

177
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:45,840
Like, every sauce that you dip, like,

178
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:50,400
Tato Slammers in at TGI Fridays is like mustard mayonnaise.

179
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:53,680
Let's get the hell out of here.

180
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:57,120
I have learned that from watching Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives that it is honestly-

181
00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:00,080
Stop, stop, stop, stop.

182
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:01,920
Why?

183
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:04,720
Because sometimes-

184
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:05,760
You're hungover.

185
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:08,960
It's 2am in a hotel room and it's the only thing on.

186
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:13,280
And it honestly is like, well, the secret ingredient is this big tub of something.

187
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:13,920
Right, yeah.

188
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:17,760
He's got this big tub of junk in the back and he won't tell me what it is.

189
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:21,040
It's ketchup and mayo and probably some relish, guy.

190
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:23,520
And sugar.

191
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:26,320
How about another question from your-

192
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:28,880
Oh, man, I closed my day on my iPad.

193
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:30,640
Just one question tonight, gang.

194
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:32,400
I was so enraptured by your-

195
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:33,520
That's going to do it for us.

196
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:34,400
I'm getting the light.

197
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:40,720
I've recently started a mural commission for a guy's Akito studio.

198
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:44,720
Important clarification from me, the oldest brother, Justin McElroy.

199
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:49,600
This is guy's possessive, not, you know, an Akito studio for the guys.

200
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:53,040
The G is also lowercase.

201
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:55,600
This is not Guy Fieri, it's Akito studio.

202
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:58,240
Wow, can I just say what a beautiful pronunciation.

203
00:10:58,240 --> 00:10:59,520
Thank you very much.

204
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:02,000
I've been watching a lot of Diners Drive-ins sometimes.

205
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:02,880
Also-

206
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:04,240
Wait, stop the podcast.

207
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:08,160
He's also, as we all know, a Krav Maga guy.

208
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:13,440
That's why he keeps his eyes on the back of his head.

209
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:13,760
Exactly.

210
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:15,600
So he's always ready for the attack.

211
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:15,840
Yes.

212
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:18,800
He has two sets of eyes.

213
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:19,520
It's not important.

214
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:22,080
These are my new Krave Maga fries.

215
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:27,280
You're gonna love these things.

216
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:29,040
Oh no, Justin broke himself.

217
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:30,160
I have broke, yeah.

218
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:34,080
I recently started a mural commission for a guy's Akito studio.

219
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:37,040
I met up once with him already, and within five minutes,

220
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:39,840
he started to get out the mats and insists on teaching me some moves.

221
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:41,600
I am but a humble artist.

222
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:48,000
And also, I don't have much interest in wrestling this stranger.

223
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,440
How do I get him to stop?

224
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:51,280
That's from the anti-wrassler.

225
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:51,840
Are you here?

226
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:53,680
All right.

227
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:55,760
Okay, you don't want to wrestle this stranger,

228
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:57,920
but maybe you want to wrestle a future friend.

229
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:03,440
All strangers are just people you haven't wrestled yet.

230
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:12,400
That's what my wrestling coach used to say before he went to jail.

231
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:25,280
How can you expect to paint Akito when you do not understand Akito?

232
00:12:25,280 --> 00:12:27,520
Or have you even done the base level?

233
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:32,400
What if you go in and your mural is like two cybernetic ninja stabbing each other?

234
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:34,080
Like, is this anything?

235
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:36,160
Is this Akito?

236
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:38,320
I couldn't be bothered to learn.

237
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:42,400
I've only played 30 seconds of Mortal Kombat, so I'm guessing.

238
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:45,520
Two jacks's from Mortal Kombat, friend.

239
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:47,200
You've done a bad job.

240
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:52,000
There's a lot of roles in Akito.

241
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:55,040
I took two Akito classes in college, so I'm a common expert.

242
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:55,680
Okay.

243
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:59,760
I would say, yeah, compared to the other two people on stage with you, you're doing great.

244
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:02,640
I had to do tiger leaps over some foam pads.

245
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:12,160
It was pretty clear quickly that this was not my martial art because it was sort of

246
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:18,400
an entry-level number of pads that I had to jump over, and I did enter.

247
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:23,520
I did not exit, so my level kind of stayed right there on top of the pads.

248
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:28,480
I think you got to somehow, he's throwing down the gauntlet, I feel like.

249
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:34,400
You need to somehow prove the deadliness of your painting abilities, and I'm saying this

250
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:39,920
out loud and realizing now that paintbrushes are not that sort of sharp.

251
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:45,840
Well, when you get them in their front or let the paint dry in them, you can fuck somebody

252
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:46,640
up with those.

253
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:52,560
You could go in the room early and paint a bunch of yourself all over the walls, and

254
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:55,040
then just hide in different positions.

255
00:13:55,040 --> 00:14:01,920
Hide in different positions, and when the moment's right, shoot him with a gun.

256
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:10,240
My only weakness.

257
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:16,960
The one thing I can't throw, a bullet.

258
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:24,000
You could paint a picture of the most embarrassing thing that's ever happened to him, and then

259
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:28,000
when he's distracted by that, he's like looking at it, simpering like, oh my god, my pants

260
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,120
really did pop pop.

261
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:32,960
That's the sound of you shooting him with a gun.

262
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:40,000
Sorry, I couldn't think of a way to close the deal with art.

263
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:44,000
Just make sure you submit that invoice first.

264
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:48,400
I have a Yahoo here that I'm so excited about.

265
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:50,960
It was sent in by the delivery man Seth Carlson.

266
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:51,520
Thank you, Seth.

267
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:53,040
Seth sent in so many bangers.

268
00:14:54,160 --> 00:15:00,160
It's from Yahoo Answers user Chris, who's been a member since January 17th, 2019.

269
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:03,520
I didn't know there were new users to this service.

270
00:15:03,520 --> 00:15:06,720
I have to imagine most of them are coming from this podcast.

271
00:15:07,520 --> 00:15:14,720
Chris asks, why haven't other animals been as generous as lizards in their evolution?

272
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:19,920
What?

273
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:21,120
What?

274
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:29,200
Animals need to eat other animals to live, but animals need to stay alive.

275
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:33,360
And lizards developing the ability to lose their tail is a good compromise.

276
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:40,000
Lizard stays alive, bird gets yum yum tail.

277
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:43,120
It's true.

278
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:44,320
It's true.

279
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:46,560
Lizards-

280
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:47,840
Can't fault the logic.

281
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:50,480
Lizards are the only nice animals on the planet, maybe?

282
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:51,360
I think so.

283
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:52,080
Disgust.

284
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:59,120
Okay, I will say that this would remove for me one of my most common guilt points in life,

285
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:01,840
which is watching any documentary about animals.

286
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:02,240
Yes.

287
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:05,840
I'm like, I always want the animal to survive that's being chased.

288
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:10,240
If the pig's belly would just fall off and then would regrow naturally.

289
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:14,960
I think my take on it would change if you showed the snake chasing the thing

290
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:18,400
and the thing got away and then you just follow the snake for the next like week

291
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:20,960
as it just got like sadder and sadder about missing.

292
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:22,160
And I would be like, no, you know what?

293
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:24,240
Next time, I hope that mouse fucking dies.

294
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:24,480
Yeah.

295
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:25,920
That's a sad ass snake.

296
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:30,640
Am I not generous to the animals of Earth with my body?

297
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:36,000
Or do the animals of Earth need to learn to like nail clippings and hair?

298
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:39,200
Because I got that.

299
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,480
If you guys want to eat that, I got it.

300
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:46,800
I like the implication of this question that way, way back in history,

301
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:48,560
a lizard was being chased by a bird.

302
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:52,000
The lizard tucked his tail in and got away and then thought, that was mean.

303
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:52,480
You know what?

304
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:55,200
I should have let him eat my butt.

305
00:16:57,040 --> 00:16:57,360
Go on.

306
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:57,760
You know what?

307
00:16:57,760 --> 00:16:59,680
Next time, I'm going to let him eat my butt.

308
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:02,720
The lizard, it feels good for the tail to come off.

309
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:03,520
It's like getting a haircut.

310
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:04,240
Lose weight?

311
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:06,560
Because it's got a lot of bad tattoos on it.

312
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:07,520
Yeah.

313
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:09,200
A lot of bad memories with that tail.

314
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:12,320
A lot of bad things. It's funny.

315
00:17:12,320 --> 00:17:14,240
And it probably makes a silly noise.

316
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:14,640
Yeah.

317
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:16,800
I've never been close enough to find out.

318
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:17,120
Yeah.

319
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:18,720
Do you think lizards are ever like,

320
00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:23,280
honey, there's so much jelly on your tail right now,

321
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:25,840
and it is really disgusting and attracting a lot of flies.

322
00:17:25,840 --> 00:17:27,440
And the lizard's like, what's the point?

323
00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:30,320
I could clean it off, but it's just going to fall off here soon.

324
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:31,280
They just flex?

325
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:32,160
I just leave it.

326
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:32,480
Hold on.

327
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:37,200
Let me flex my butt to try to get my tail to slam the door on it.

328
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:40,560
Hey, honey, do you know any hawks?

329
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:41,600
What about the neighbors?

330
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:43,440
We haven't had them over for dinner in a while.

331
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:44,720
I'll have them come over and eat my butt.

332
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:48,000
It's only generous.

333
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,760
It's the least we could do.

334
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:50,640
They helped us move.

335
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:52,400
I'm going to tie the end of my tail to that door,

336
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:53,920
and you've got to just slam it real fast.

337
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:54,320
Slam it.

338
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:56,640
What about eggs?

339
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:57,120
Right?

340
00:17:57,120 --> 00:17:57,680
Chickens lay eggs.

341
00:17:57,680 --> 00:17:58,960
Yes. Okay. Yes.

342
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:00,560
And you can eat those, right?

343
00:18:00,560 --> 00:18:01,360
That's generous.

344
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:05,280
I'm almost positive lizards lay eggs too, though.

345
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:07,360
So they still got them one up.

346
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:11,200
Until a chicken's butt can fall off and grow back,

347
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:13,040
it's hard for them to beat lizards.

348
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:14,960
Tails, eggs, milk.

349
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:16,640
What can't lizards do for us?

350
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:17,760
Wait, hold on.

351
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:22,640
At least one of those out of their lizard nibbles.

352
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:29,680
Or is that the milk the lizard buys and then gives to somebody else?

353
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:30,800
Hey, I've got some milk.

354
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:36,720
Use this milk to wash down my butt.

355
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:38,560
Oh, stuck in your teeth there, friend.

356
00:18:38,560 --> 00:18:39,200
I got you.

357
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:39,920
I got you.

358
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:42,480
Where is that for real, though?

359
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:42,720
Okay.

360
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:46,080
Where's the new tail even come from?

361
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:48,480
One of their arms gets shorter.

362
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:53,520
It's like bugs and stuff, right?

363
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:58,320
The lizard will eat bugs and stuff and make a new tail out of it.

364
00:18:59,360 --> 00:18:59,920
So when they-

365
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:05,840
The same way you make teeth out of cereal and carrots, right?

366
00:19:07,040 --> 00:19:09,520
You eat cereal and carrots and turn them into teeth.

367
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:10,320
You know.

368
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:11,040
You know.

369
00:19:11,040 --> 00:19:11,600
Science.

370
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:16,160
I can't believe you told everybody about my secret breakfast time treat.

371
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:21,200
You eat a lot of Ritz crackers and Capri Suns and it turns into wrists.

372
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:25,280
Same thing.

373
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:30,400
Oh, my hair keeps getting longer because I keep eating all this butter.

374
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:36,480
I just got a new job at a call center here in town that has a lot of perks such as a gym.

375
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:39,040
Poor lizards, man.

376
00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:40,000
They got it rough, huh?

377
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:43,200
Well, if I didn't really thought about their plight-

378
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:46,560
What if their tail comes off and they're like, that was a great tail.

379
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:47,360
I love that tail.

380
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:48,560
God damn it.

381
00:19:48,560 --> 00:19:50,320
Peter Capaldi tail was my favorite.

382
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:56,400
Um, a lot of perks at this new job, such as gym, free meals, and a ton of discounts.

383
00:19:56,400 --> 00:20:03,200
Another perk is that we get a fully stocked self-service wet bar that employees can just go to.

384
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:04,880
What is this place of business?

385
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:06,400
Um, I don't know.

386
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:07,680
It sounds cool.

387
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:08,240
We'll ask.

388
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:09,200
A call center?

389
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:10,000
A call center.

390
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:13,520
A chill call center for laid back people.

391
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:16,880
It's a stressful job taking calls from pissed off customers all day.

392
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:21,760
And I just need to know when it's appropriate to go to the well, if you know what I mean.

393
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:22,800
Yeah, we do.

394
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:23,280
We do.

395
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:24,800
You mentioned it a sentence ago.

396
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:25,760
Yeah, one sentence.

397
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:32,880
Also, it would help if you could help me dodge the awkward eye contact from my new co-workers.

398
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:35,120
That's from Boozy in Birmingham, are you here?

399
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:36,800
Okay.

400
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:37,360
So you drank-

401
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:38,800
This one, we're just going to put this-

402
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:39,760
Time to dunk.

403
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:42,720
Um, I'm really glad that it's-

404
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:44,240
I want to say one thing before we get started.

405
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:49,040
One thing before we get started, I think it sucks that because of stuff like salad bars,

406
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:51,360
we have to call real bars, wet bars.

407
00:20:53,040 --> 00:20:54,880
It does sound like an unfortunate-

408
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:56,640
Like you go over like, oh, this is a wet bar.

409
00:20:56,640 --> 00:21:02,640
You know, the one with liquids at it, as opposed to like pizza and dessert pizza, CC's Pizza.

410
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:10,000
I think it's a very good thing that it is a self-service bar, because otherwise, the

411
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:14,320
idea of like, and now there's just a person in the room where you do work who's not working,

412
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:18,560
but waiting for you to stop working to come over and like, hey, you live Thursday.

413
00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:18,800
Yeah.

414
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:20,480
I'm bored.

415
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:24,960
We had an experience like this one time.

416
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:25,600
Oh my God.

417
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:27,600
Can we not say the name of the city?

418
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:28,000
We won't.

419
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:28,640
Let's not put them on blast.

420
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:29,440
Because it was not-

421
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:30,400
It was incredibly nice.

422
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:31,120
It was incredibly nice.

423
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:37,280
They like made us dinner backstage, which usually we just don't, that doesn't really happen.

424
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:41,440
They made us dinner, but they also had, and this is going to sound like kind of schmaltzy

425
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:41,760
at first.

426
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:42,640
And it was.

427
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:43,680
We did not request this.

428
00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:46,320
We asked for like Ritz crackers and milk and some beers.

429
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:47,600
And lizard butts.

430
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:48,400
And lizard butts.

431
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:50,800
Because they're just laying around.

432
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:55,840
They had, and they did this for everybody, a barista back there making coffees for everybody.

433
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:58,240
But it's just the three of us.

434
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:01,520
And I was also really sick.

435
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:07,280
So it's just like, this guy just stands there staring at Travis and Griffin who by 30 minutes

436
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:12,960
of showtime are like this because of the social anxiety they want to make this guy feel valued.

437
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:16,960
He would say across the room, like, are you sure you don't want anything?

438
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:18,480
And they're like, oh yeah.

439
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:20,080
Are you good on coffee?

440
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:20,720
All right.

441
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:23,680
They also had a huge record collection and a record player.

442
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:28,160
So then there's the anxiety point there too of like, let me put on some cool tunes for

443
00:22:28,160 --> 00:22:29,520
my new friend.

444
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:32,720
And they asked, like, what's a cool record you want to listen to?

445
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:35,520
And I believe Griffin said, whatever you want to listen to.

446
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:36,020
Yeah.

447
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:39,120
Casey, you like?

448
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:41,840
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, for sure.

449
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:44,080
So the thing about this is this is a trap.

450
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:44,580
Yeah.

451
00:22:44,580 --> 00:22:49,600
This shelf service wet bar, if you walk behind it, you just like fall through a trap door

452
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:50,880
into unemployment.

453
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:51,380
Yeah.

454
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:56,400
If you upturn one of these bottles, a pink slip falls out.

455
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:57,920
It's like, oh man.

456
00:22:57,920 --> 00:23:01,120
Here's a Yahoo that was sent in by the delivery man, Seth Carlson.

457
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:01,680
Thank you, Seth.

458
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:04,480
It's Yahoo Answers user, holy shit.

459
00:23:06,560 --> 00:23:07,520
It's Chris again.

460
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:13,760
It's the same Chris.

461
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:16,720
January 17, 2019.

462
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:18,000
Chris, are you here?

463
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:18,720
It's Chris.

464
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:27,520
Chris asks, what if every cup ever disappeared?

465
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:31,680
Now wait.

466
00:23:31,680 --> 00:23:32,240
Hold on.

467
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:32,800
Hold on.

468
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:35,680
Really think about it.

469
00:23:37,680 --> 00:23:42,960
What if every cup ever disappeared?

470
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:43,600
Holy shit.

471
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:47,040
First thing, soccer and hockey.

472
00:23:47,040 --> 00:23:47,600
Boring.

473
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:50,480
Anticlimactic.

474
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:53,440
I would also say last supper, that's out.

475
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:53,920
That's gone.

476
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:56,480
Soccer and hockey, anticlimactic.

477
00:23:58,080 --> 00:24:02,080
Most other sports where balls travel at higher velocities, much more exciting.

478
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:02,560
Yeah.

479
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:03,120
Danger.

480
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:03,920
Ratchet it up.

481
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:04,560
No cups.

482
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:13,200
No cu- see cause it's kind of a fun twist on the thing.

483
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:14,640
Do you think the-

484
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:15,760
Hunt for the Holy Grail.

485
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:16,320
Over.

486
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:16,800
Undone.

487
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:18,960
Do we now, does this mean-

488
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:21,680
Now it's just called Jesus's cool bowl.

489
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:26,720
That cool plate Jesus made, probably.

490
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:31,600
Is it a thing of like, we've never known about cups or like we all now suddenly-

491
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:32,160
It's a rapture.

492
00:24:32,160 --> 00:24:32,880
It's the cup sure.

493
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:33,840
It's gone.

494
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:35,200
We knew of them.

495
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:39,120
We knew of them, but if you make a new one, it turns to ash in your hand.

496
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:39,360
Yes.

497
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:43,040
I think it's, there will be two flash points.

498
00:24:43,040 --> 00:24:46,640
Much like the rapture, the cup sure, there'll be two flash points.

499
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:53,040
The one will be when I'm drinking my nice red wine over my nice new white linen pants.

500
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:56,640
And then both of those things aren't true anymore.

501
00:24:56,640 --> 00:24:57,120
Right.

502
00:24:57,680 --> 00:25:01,280
And then also having to rebuild society when all the cups are gone.

503
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:04,240
That we can't, so we can no longer make cups.

504
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:05,280
It's not just like cups are gone-

505
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:06,880
You make a cup, it turns to ash.

506
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:07,840
These are the rules.

507
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:14,640
So like, you would have to just like, if you were at a bar, just like stick your head under the tap.

508
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:18,400
Or just like, ooh, just put taps on the wall, insert a dollar.

509
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:26,080
Or you're like, I'll have a whiskey straight up and another for my gentleman friend here.

510
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:27,840
And then you just extend both of your hands.

511
00:25:33,040 --> 00:25:35,120
I want to do it on the mic just to get a really good clean.

512
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:38,240
Yeah, sure, sure, sure.

513
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:40,240
Did you hear what happened to Susan?

514
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:40,960
It's crazy.

515
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:46,320
Hey, I just want to tell you, I'm having a really great time tonight.

516
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:47,600
I'd love it if we could do this again.

517
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:52,720
Anyway, here's to Mark and Susan.

518
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:54,320
Best friends ever.

519
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:58,320
May their marriage continue on in perpetuity and perfect happiness.

520
00:26:01,040 --> 00:26:04,000
A cheers at that point would just be a very messy high five.

521
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:05,520
Yeah.

522
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:10,720
And you know, now that he's gone, I just don't know how I'll be able to continue on.

523
00:26:13,680 --> 00:26:14,800
I'll have another.

524
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:19,760
So anyway, I've turned, through prayer, I've turned this wine into the blood of Jesus.

525
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:22,880
I'm just going to clip the end of this Ziploc baggie.

526
00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:29,920
I'll ask you to in turn just kind of gerbil style.

527
00:26:29,920 --> 00:26:32,560
If you could not, don't put your lips to it.

528
00:26:32,560 --> 00:26:34,080
It's cold and flu season.

529
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:35,760
Please folks, be smart.

530
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:42,000
Just hold the wafer up and I'm going to just pump this super soaker and just like get psyched.

531
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,240
It's about to get wet and wild up in here.

532
00:26:45,280 --> 00:26:48,080
So did you need a urine sample?

533
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:49,140
No.

534
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:53,120
We didn't.

535
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:56,000
You look trustworthy.

536
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:56,960
You're fine.

537
00:26:56,960 --> 00:27:00,240
Oh shit.

538
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:04,800
There's the best answer, only answer I hear from cat lover who says, that'd be bad.

539
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:14,160
And the asker, the asker, fucking Chris, he gave that'd be bad one out of five stars to

540
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:15,040
asker rating.

541
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:17,680
I know it'd be bad.

542
00:27:17,680 --> 00:27:18,960
Fucking mad lad, Chris.

543
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:19,680
I love this dude.

544
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:20,880
I'm going to check his whole history.

545
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:24,320
Get that, get that full SoundCloud up.

546
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:24,800
Yeah.

547
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:26,160
Oh, he's pretty good.

548
00:27:26,160 --> 00:27:29,920
He's asked a lot of questions since January 17th.

549
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:32,560
Oh hey, he's sure, he's been busy.

550
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:35,200
What would it be like if Shrek had a brother?

551
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:38,960
Yes, yes.

552
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:40,560
He read my fan fiction.

553
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:47,440
What if he had two brothers, two younger brothers?

554
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:48,960
I think it'd go a little something like this.

555
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:49,840
Come on fellas.

556
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:52,880
Would it be illegal to set up Burger King for a lawsuit?

557
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:58,800
Chris, you got to get that money somehow.

558
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:07,040
Hey everybody, it's Griffin.

559
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:09,600
I'm just going to go ahead and do this money zone by myself.

560
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:11,520
I'm not scared to do it by myself.

561
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:13,120
A lot of people are saying I seem shaky.

562
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:17,040
I seem nervous because the boys asked me to do this one by myself, but I'm not afraid.

563
00:28:17,040 --> 00:28:19,920
I'm so excited and I hope I make you proud of me.

564
00:28:19,920 --> 00:28:22,880
Uh, my first sponsor that we have is stamps.com.

565
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:27,520
Stampies are little sticky pieces of paper that have fun images on them.

566
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:32,720
And when you put them on your letters and packages and stuff, then it lets the, it's

567
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:40,000
like a password for the male people to know that you are, it's a good male and therefore

568
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,720
it deserves to get to the places that it needs to get to.

569
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:45,120
Uh, here's the rough part.

570
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:48,160
Postage rates, they recently went up again.

571
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:53,520
But thankfully stamps.com can ease the pain with big old discounts off of post office

572
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:54,640
retail sales.

573
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:58,480
They have all the services of the US postal service and they put them right at your fingertips.

574
00:28:58,480 --> 00:29:02,640
You can buy and you can print these little sticky guys for any letter, any package, any

575
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:04,800
class of mail using your own computer and printer.

576
00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:06,720
Stamps.com saves you money.

577
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:10,160
They give you postage discounts you can't get at the post office, including five cents

578
00:29:10,160 --> 00:29:12,160
off every first class stamp.

579
00:29:12,160 --> 00:29:14,560
That junk adds up.

580
00:29:14,560 --> 00:29:17,520
So, uh, yeah, stamps.com is very, very helpful.

581
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:22,800
If it's, you know, the snowpocalypse wherever you live, it's if winter has come like a game

582
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:25,600
of Thrones, then you don't want to leave the house.

583
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:27,440
You got to get your stamps.com right now.

Just go to stamps.com, click on the microphone at the top of the homepage and type in my

588
00:29:41,280 --> 00:29:41,680
brother.

589
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:43,440
That's stamps.com.

590
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:45,280
Enter my brother, all one word.

591
00:29:45,280 --> 00:29:46,560
Also want to tell you about Squarespace.

592
00:29:46,560 --> 00:29:50,880
Squarespace is the coolest shape zone that I can even think of.

593
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:53,760
And if you go to it, then they're going to help you make a great website.

594
00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:58,800
We've used it to make countless websites, some goofy and fun, like a fun joke.

595
00:29:58,800 --> 00:30:04,000
But even when they're fun jokes, they look very pretty and beautiful and sexy.

596
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:05,840
And that's what Squarespace does.

597
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:09,440
They let you make websites you can use to showcase your work or announce an upcoming

598
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:13,280
project or special project or upcoming event or special event.

599
00:30:13,280 --> 00:30:15,760
And you can promote your physical or online business.

600
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:19,120
You can sell stuff using e-commerce functionality.

601
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:22,880
They got world class designers making just cranking out fucking constantly cranking out

602
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:26,000
these customizable beautiful templates.

603
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:27,920
And they got analytics.

604
00:30:27,920 --> 00:30:30,320
And do they have search engine optimization?

605
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:34,320
That's like asking if they have 24 seven award winning customer support.

606
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:36,400
Because yes, the answer to both of those.

607
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:39,680
Think it, dream it, make it with Squarespace.

608
00:30:39,680 --> 00:30:42,080
Go to squarespace.com slash my brother for a free trial.

611
00:30:48,560 --> 00:30:52,000
Oh hey, we just announced also that we're going to be doing some live shows coming up

612
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:52,960
in April.

613
00:30:52,960 --> 00:31:00,400
We are going to be doing Taz, Amma, Bim Bam in that order on April 2nd and April 3rd in

614
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:01,200
San Jose.

615
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:05,840
And then April 4th, we're going to be bringing my brother, my brother, me to Salt Lake City.

616
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:08,800
And we're very, very excited to get out there.

617
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:10,800
We haven't been to either of those places before.

618
00:31:10,800 --> 00:31:14,320
And we're going to get there and we're going to do our sick twist at Brannock Goofs and

619
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:17,760
probably get kicked out of town by the cops because of how sick and twisted it is.

620
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:21,520
City Council's going to vote to kick us out because of how just fucked up it's going to

621
00:31:21,520 --> 00:31:22,160
be.

622
00:31:22,160 --> 00:31:28,000
But yeah, you can find the links to those at McElroy.shows and we hope that you come

623
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:28,960
out and see us.

624
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:31,600
We'll have all the ticket links there.

625
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:38,640
We are going to put them on sale Friday, February 15th at 10am local time.

626
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:40,240
There's not going to be a presale this time.

627
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:43,840
So 10am local to wherever, whichever city you want to go to.

628
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:49,520
This Friday, February 15th is when tickets are going to go on sale and yeah, keep an

629
00:31:49,520 --> 00:31:55,680
eye out and we'll have stuff up on the website probably by tomorrow or so.

630
00:31:55,680 --> 00:31:59,680
So again, Salt Lake City, San Jose, come on out.

631
00:31:59,680 --> 00:32:04,080
Thanks to everybody else who came out to our shows in Birmingham and New Orleans.

632
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:05,680
We had a fucking amazing time.

633
00:32:05,680 --> 00:32:07,760
Thank you all so much for your hospitality.

634
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:12,960
And yeah, I hope we can get out to more places soon and I think that's it.

635
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:15,280
Thanks to Maximum Fun for having us on the network.

636
00:32:15,280 --> 00:32:17,520
Go to MaximumFun.org, check out all the great shows there.

637
00:32:17,520 --> 00:32:19,760
They got shows like Friendly Fire.

638
00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:21,360
They got shows like Beef and Dairy Network.

639
00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:25,280
They got shows like One Bad Mother and a bunch more at MaximumFun.org.

640
00:32:25,920 --> 00:32:28,960
Again, we have other stuff at McElroy.shows.com.

641
00:32:29,520 --> 00:32:32,160
Again, we got other stuff at McElroy.family.

642
00:32:32,160 --> 00:32:34,640
I think I said the old web address earlier.

643
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:36,400
I'm still getting used to it, growing pains.

644
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:39,040
This is why I shouldn't be trusted to do this by myself.

645
00:32:39,040 --> 00:32:42,000
Oh, and thanks to John Roderick and the Long Winters for these for theme song.

646
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,320
It's a departure off the album, putting the days to bed.

647
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:45,520
It's real good stuff.

648
00:32:45,520 --> 00:32:46,640
Okay, here's the rest of the episode.

649
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:49,360
We'll be back with a regular episode next week.

650
00:32:49,360 --> 00:32:50,800
So we'll talk to you then, bye.

651
00:32:50,800 --> 00:32:55,280
Greetings, I am Plec Dexsetter contacting you from the Zik Squadron,

652
00:32:55,280 --> 00:32:59,120
which is frankly sort of crappy, but I'm here on a heroic mission

653
00:32:59,120 --> 00:33:01,920
with my trusty crew, C-53.

654
00:33:01,920 --> 00:33:03,520
Heroic, that's like an exaggeration.

655
00:33:03,520 --> 00:33:04,320
Okay, sure.

656
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:06,480
And the security officer, Dar.

657
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:08,240
Plec, don't put me in your stupid recording.

658
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:12,880
And we're all traveling aboard our trusty starship, the Bargerian Jade.

659
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:15,040
Bargy.

660
00:33:15,040 --> 00:33:15,280
What?

661
00:33:15,280 --> 00:33:16,400
Sorry, I'm awake.

662
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:16,960
I'm awake.

663
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:19,920
I was just flying while asleep.

664
00:33:21,680 --> 00:33:25,040
Hey there, this is Alden Ford, I play Plec, and we are so excited to announce

665
00:33:25,040 --> 00:33:29,200
that our podcast, Mission to Zix, is now part of the Maximum Fun Network.

666
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:32,000
Our third season launches on Max Fun on March 20th.

667
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:33,760
Binge seasons one and two right now.

668
00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:36,160
That's Mission to Zix, Z-Y-X-X.

669
00:33:36,800 --> 00:33:38,960
Oh man, I love Chris.

670
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:40,560
Hey, you want to say something?

671
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:41,520
Yeah, I'd love to.

672
00:33:41,520 --> 00:33:42,640
From your iPad?

673
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:43,840
Yeah, I'll say something from my iPad.

674
00:33:43,840 --> 00:33:45,600
Do you have a Yahoo you want to do?

675
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:58,960
Here's one from Chris who asks,

676
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:07,840
does, are you not going to interrupt me on this one?

677
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:09,120
I just asked for Yahoo.

678
00:34:09,120 --> 00:34:10,000
Oh, okay.

679
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:11,120
I'll read another Yahoo.

680
00:34:11,680 --> 00:34:13,680
Here's one sent in by the delivery man, Seth Carlson.

681
00:34:13,680 --> 00:34:14,240
Thank you, Seth.

682
00:34:14,240 --> 00:34:16,800
It's an anonymous Yahoo answers user who asks,

683
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:18,400
are you going to interrupt me or not?

684
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:24,560
I was just making that up.

685
00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:26,160
I thought for sure you were going to jump in and interrupt me.

686
00:34:26,160 --> 00:34:27,440
I'm so uncomfortable.

687
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:28,000
All right.

688
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:28,960
This one is sent in by-

689
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:31,120
If you think I'm going to do it, I don't feel anything.

690
00:34:31,120 --> 00:34:32,160
Okay, sure.

691
00:34:32,160 --> 00:34:46,560
Moira sent this one in.

692
00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:54,960
No, no, no.

693
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:55,360
You messed me up.

694
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:56,560
There's no rhythm.

695
00:34:56,560 --> 00:34:57,520
There's no rhythm.

696
00:34:57,520 --> 00:34:58,080
I'm so on.

697
00:34:58,960 --> 00:34:59,840
I got to start over.

698
00:34:59,840 --> 00:35:00,240
Fuck.

699
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:06,000
It's rubato.

700
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:07,280
I want a munch.

701
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:14,240
Started way too high.

702
00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:17,040
This is the Munch Squad.

703
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:18,320
It's a podcast without a podcast.

704
00:35:21,040 --> 00:35:24,800
The latest and greatest in fast food innovation.

705
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:32,400
I had several sort of lined up for the hometown crowd here in Alabama.

706
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:36,240
And this one is a late entry from Wendy's.

707
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:40,960
Wendy's, I feel like it's been a little while since Wendy's.

708
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:44,640
Yeah, we don't often get Wendy's on Munch Squad.

709
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:47,280
But Wendy's beefs up menu.

710
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:50,080
So I need you to say that word again, but way slower.

711
00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:51,840
Wendy's.

712
00:35:51,840 --> 00:35:52,880
Got that word.

713
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:55,360
Beefs up menu.

714
00:35:56,160 --> 00:35:56,480
Okay.

715
00:35:57,040 --> 00:36:00,560
Because beef with three new burgers.

716
00:36:01,840 --> 00:36:02,320
Wendy's.

717
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:05,440
God, this one really hurts.

718
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:06,880
Hang in there with me, okay?

719
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:10,400
We're going to get through it together and we're not going to get depressed, okay?

720
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:12,080
We all promise that right now, okay?

721
00:36:13,120 --> 00:36:16,320
We're going to have fun after this, but we do have to get through it, okay?

722
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:17,920
Let's all take our medicine.

723
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:23,840
And remember that a person, in much the same way that you're a person, wrote this.

724
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:27,840
I need a sip, hold on.

725
00:36:31,120 --> 00:36:36,160
Wendy's new made to crave menu unlocks a whole new world of cheeseburgers

726
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:45,760
made with unforgettable flavors that take craveability to its peak, period, end of sentence.

727
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:53,200
One more time, because I think whoever invented language, if they heard this one,

728
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:55,840
they'd be like, I'm just going to go to the park.

729
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:04,000
Wendy's new made to crave menu unlocks a whole new world of cheeseburgers

730
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:09,120
made with unforgettable flavors that take craveability to its peak.

731
00:37:11,120 --> 00:37:15,120
There have been some really craveable substances on earth before this.

732
00:37:15,120 --> 00:37:16,240
Yeah, it's at its peak.

733
00:37:16,240 --> 00:37:20,720
The new made to crave line introduces a trio of cheeseburgers

734
00:37:20,720 --> 00:37:23,040
to the fresh, never frozen beef family.

735
00:37:23,680 --> 00:37:29,440
Sawsome bacon cheeseburger, peppercorn mushroom melt, and barbecue cheeseburger.

736
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:31,040
Did you say sawsome?

737
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:46,720
Well, Travis, this time I said sawsome, because it's S, apostrophe, A, with some sawsome.

738
00:37:46,720 --> 00:37:47,760
Okay, shut up.

739
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:48,560
Everybody, shut up.

740
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:50,880
Let's face it.

741
00:37:57,200 --> 00:37:59,360
We've been in denial for too long.

742
00:37:59,360 --> 00:38:03,040
If nobody else is going to fucking say it, I'll fucking say it.

743
00:38:04,160 --> 00:38:05,600
Let's face it, everybody.

744
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:16,240
Foodies want maximum craveability and quickly get hooked on the deliciously different flavors

745
00:38:16,240 --> 00:38:19,200
Wendy's is known for, bringing to the table.

746
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:25,280
Deliciously different is capitalized, bringing to the table,

747
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:30,480
but sometimes these on-trend flavors are offered for a limited time.

748
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:33,360
So what?

749
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:37,440
Why did you bring me here, Dave?

750
00:38:39,120 --> 00:38:42,160
This was written by DeepMind.

751
00:38:42,160 --> 00:38:44,560
This was written by a machine learning program.

752
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:48,240
This one scrolled through the QSR web.

753
00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:48,740
Uh-oh.

754
00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:51,840
Fuck this fucking thing.

755
00:38:51,840 --> 00:38:55,600
I think someone's trolling me, honestly.

756
00:38:55,600 --> 00:39:02,480
The now made to crave offers the same deliciousness as an exclusive menu item,

757
00:39:03,360 --> 00:39:04,560
but is here to stay.

758
00:39:09,600 --> 00:39:18,320
Let me finish so you can have flavor for days, specifically Monday through Sunday all year long.

759
00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:21,760
I'm going to read it all together.

760
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:22,640
Let's face it.

761
00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:27,280
Foodies want maximum craveability and quickly get hooked on the deliciously different flavors

762
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:29,440
Wendy's is known for, bringing to the table,

763
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:33,600
but sometimes these on-trend flavors are offered for a limited time.

764
00:39:33,600 --> 00:39:38,400
Now made to crave offers the same deliciousness as an exclusive menu item,

765
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:42,160
but is here to stay so you can have flavor for days,

766
00:39:42,160 --> 00:39:46,000
specifically Monday through Sunday all year long.

767
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:49,600
That I love how that whole paragraph is written with a tone of voice of,

768
00:39:49,600 --> 00:39:50,720
is this what you want?

769
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:53,520
Does this make you happy?

770
00:39:53,520 --> 00:39:54,960
We don't know anymore.

771
00:39:54,960 --> 00:39:59,440
The image of somebody taking a bite out of a very wet hamburger

772
00:40:00,720 --> 00:40:02,640
and then saying out loud,

773
00:40:03,680 --> 00:40:05,040
this is so delicious.

774
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:09,680
It, it must be from June only.

775
00:40:09,680 --> 00:40:12,160
You're telling me this is available year round?

776
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:13,280
This is year round.

777
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:15,760
I would like to eat this Monday through Sunday.

778
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:18,400
Monday through Sunday every day of the year.

779
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:20,080
It's Monday through Sunday every day of the year.

780
00:40:20,080 --> 00:40:21,200
So Thursday?

781
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:21,700
Yeah.

782
00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:25,040
I crave this immediately.

783
00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:29,200
I have a quote from Kurt Cain, Wendy's executive vice president.

784
00:40:29,200 --> 00:40:32,000
I thought for fucking sure you were going to say from Kurt Cameron.

785
00:40:35,120 --> 00:40:38,880
My spiritual dad, Jesus, made these burgers and it's awesome.

786
00:40:40,080 --> 00:40:42,720
The shape of this burger just proves evolution.

787
00:40:42,720 --> 00:40:46,800
The shape, the shape of this word proves the devil exists because sawsome

788
00:40:47,680 --> 00:40:49,360
was spoken by a human tongue.

789
00:40:50,080 --> 00:40:54,240
Quote, there's a reason we named the new menu line made to crave,

790
00:40:54,240 --> 00:40:56,560
said Kurt Cain, because it's true.

791
00:40:59,360 --> 00:41:00,080
Okay.

792
00:41:00,080 --> 00:41:04,320
But it, who makes a new cheeseburger line and it's like,

793
00:41:04,320 --> 00:41:06,240
we don't want these to be craved.

794
00:41:06,240 --> 00:41:07,680
No one will want this.

795
00:41:07,680 --> 00:41:12,240
These hamburgers are so undeniably good that made to crave is being integrated

796
00:41:12,240 --> 00:41:13,760
as part of our everyday menu.

797
00:41:14,560 --> 00:41:18,160
But that's just putting new things on a menu.

798
00:41:19,120 --> 00:41:20,880
No, you stupid idiot.

799
00:41:22,320 --> 00:41:24,320
They're making craveable options,

800
00:41:24,320 --> 00:41:29,200
peak flavorability for foodies like you to re-enjoy all fring-dong.

801
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:29,520
Yeah.

802
00:41:33,040 --> 00:41:34,560
None of it means anything.

803
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:37,600
Now they're going to have to train all their employees when somebody's like,

804
00:41:37,600 --> 00:41:39,840
yeah, let me get a five piece of chicken nuggets.

805
00:41:39,840 --> 00:41:43,120
And then the employees just have to say, you fucking idiot.

806
00:41:45,120 --> 00:41:45,760
Are you sure?

807
00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:47,200
Are you sure?

808
00:41:47,200 --> 00:41:49,920
It's not peak craveability, you dummy.

809
00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:53,520
The sawsome bacon cheeseburger.

810
00:41:53,520 --> 00:41:54,720
Now you did say bacon.

811
00:41:55,440 --> 00:41:56,640
You did just say bacon.

812
00:41:56,640 --> 00:41:57,680
You're welcome.

813
00:41:57,680 --> 00:42:01,760
Peppercorn mushroom melt and barbecue cheeseburger are individually crafted

814
00:42:01,760 --> 00:42:03,360
and available every day.

815
00:42:03,360 --> 00:42:06,480
So you can indulge in the flavors you want when you want them.

816
00:42:07,040 --> 00:42:09,680
How wild would it be if the inverse were true?

817
00:42:09,680 --> 00:42:10,880
You get involved.

818
00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:14,480
You can indulge the flavors you want when we decide you're damn good and ready.

819
00:42:16,080 --> 00:42:18,160
Can I have the sawsome?

820
00:42:18,160 --> 00:42:18,400
No.

821
00:42:19,680 --> 00:42:20,960
Has baby been a good boy?

822
00:42:22,720 --> 00:42:23,680
I don't know, Dave.

823
00:42:24,880 --> 00:42:26,000
I mean, I guess.

824
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:26,800
I guess, Dave.

825
00:42:26,800 --> 00:42:27,680
What do you mean, bud?

826
00:42:27,680 --> 00:42:30,320
I don't need to read the descriptions of all the things,

827
00:42:30,320 --> 00:42:32,480
but I do want to close with the opening line.

828
00:42:32,480 --> 00:42:34,480
You're not going to explain to me what sawsome is?

829
00:42:36,080 --> 00:42:37,440
It's just much ketchup.

830
00:42:37,440 --> 00:42:39,440
It's got a windy side of sawsome sauce.

831
00:42:39,440 --> 00:42:41,920
Lathered between a warm and fluffy premium bun.

832
00:42:44,320 --> 00:42:45,600
There's meat and shit too.

833
00:42:45,600 --> 00:42:46,480
I just skipped to the end.

834
00:42:47,680 --> 00:42:52,400
What kind of raggedy dog ass buns have you been feeding us this whole time, Dave?

835
00:42:54,480 --> 00:42:54,800
Okay.

836
00:42:55,680 --> 00:42:58,800
Here's the opener for the description of the barbecue cheeseburger.

837
00:42:58,800 --> 00:43:00,320
Because I know you read then you're like,

838
00:43:00,320 --> 00:43:01,520
what the fuck could that be?

839
00:43:01,520 --> 00:43:08,240
Wendy's has long understood what makes barbecue taste so great.

840
00:43:10,240 --> 00:43:13,280
It has done nothing with this information, but we know it.

841
00:43:14,240 --> 00:43:15,760
You fucking braggarts.

842
00:43:16,640 --> 00:43:18,080
You know, you like barbecue,

843
00:43:18,080 --> 00:43:20,720
but you probably don't know why it tastes so great, but we do.

844
00:43:20,720 --> 00:43:21,280
Fuck off.

845
00:43:23,920 --> 00:43:27,040
Wendy's has long understood what makes barbecue taste so great.

846
00:43:27,040 --> 00:43:30,160
Now the barbecue cheeseburger finds that backyard balance

847
00:43:30,160 --> 00:43:32,720
of sweet and heat with a touch of smoke.

848
00:43:32,720 --> 00:43:37,040
So Wendy's knew, but they didn't want to share it with you,

849
00:43:37,040 --> 00:43:39,840
the consumer, until you were damn good and ready for it.

850
00:43:40,960 --> 00:43:44,880
But that also kind of sounds like Wendy's is someone who just tasted barbecue

851
00:43:44,880 --> 00:43:47,600
for the first time and said, you know what makes this good?

852
00:43:47,600 --> 00:43:48,560
Sauce.

853
00:43:48,560 --> 00:43:51,520
You know, I think the secret is the sauce.

854
00:43:51,520 --> 00:43:53,680
I think the sauce is what makes barbecue good.

855
00:43:53,680 --> 00:43:56,400
Hey, is this mayonnaise?

856
00:43:56,400 --> 00:44:00,560
No, Dave, it's not.

857
00:44:00,560 --> 00:44:03,120
It's barbecue sauce.

858
00:44:03,120 --> 00:44:04,000
Oh, shit.

859
00:44:04,720 --> 00:44:06,160
That's the secret, right?

860
00:44:07,120 --> 00:44:09,280
Oh, it's right in front of you the whole time.

861
00:44:09,920 --> 00:44:12,480
Anyway, I'm going to tell my kids about this

862
00:44:13,760 --> 00:44:15,840
and maybe they'll action the information.

863
00:44:16,560 --> 00:44:19,440
I did my will that they can't act on it for 20 years.

864
00:44:19,440 --> 00:44:20,800
Yes, bury the secret.

865
00:44:21,440 --> 00:44:22,640
Too fucking craveable.

866
00:44:23,520 --> 00:44:24,480
The world's not ready.

867
00:44:24,480 --> 00:44:25,040
We're not ready.

868
00:44:25,040 --> 00:44:28,080
We don't have enough locations to burn us down.

869
00:44:29,120 --> 00:44:31,840
Like when those dorks couldn't get that special sauce at McDonald's.

870
00:44:31,840 --> 00:44:32,560
We don't need that.

871
00:44:33,440 --> 00:44:34,960
We don't need one of those scenarios.

872
00:44:36,480 --> 00:44:38,800
Saw some, saw some, saw some.

873
00:44:38,800 --> 00:44:41,280
They're lifting the building up and carrying it to the river.

874
00:44:44,400 --> 00:44:46,560
They don't even know what saw some sauce is.

875
00:44:49,360 --> 00:44:51,520
I'm a real sheep in the river.

876
00:44:51,520 --> 00:44:56,000
As soon as you started chanting, I, like a sheep I am, just joined in the chant.

877
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:57,360
I just love chanting.

878
00:44:57,360 --> 00:44:58,800
It was amazing to watch that happen.

879
00:44:58,800 --> 00:45:00,320
How quickly I was there.

880
00:45:00,320 --> 00:45:00,880
It's a human.

881
00:45:02,160 --> 00:45:03,440
Do you want a Yahoo?

882
00:45:03,440 --> 00:45:03,920
Yes.

883
00:45:03,920 --> 00:45:04,480
Yeah, sure.

884
00:45:04,480 --> 00:45:05,040
Okay.

885
00:45:05,760 --> 00:45:07,680
This one is sent in by the delivery man, Seth Carlson.

886
00:45:07,680 --> 00:45:08,160
Thank you, Seth.

887
00:45:08,160 --> 00:45:09,200
It's Yahoo Answers user.

888
00:45:09,200 --> 00:45:11,760
They're anonymous, so I'm going to call them Dave asks,

889
00:45:11,760 --> 00:45:20,720
how can I make a 2004 Honda Accord sexy as shit?

890
00:45:20,720 --> 00:45:21,360
How is that?

891
00:45:21,360 --> 00:45:25,920
How are they allowed to, oh, they've used like a special eye.

892
00:45:25,920 --> 00:45:29,520
So the Yahoo Answers filter didn't, didn't get them.

893
00:45:29,520 --> 00:45:31,520
There's a put some boobs on it.

894
00:45:31,520 --> 00:45:33,760
Travis says, put some breasts.

895
00:45:33,760 --> 00:45:36,960
Put some boobs on that 2004 Honda Accord.

896
00:45:36,960 --> 00:45:37,760
Why not?

897
00:45:37,760 --> 00:45:38,800
Why not do that?

898
00:45:38,800 --> 00:45:39,520
I asked.

899
00:45:39,520 --> 00:45:41,840
I can think of a few reasons.

900
00:45:41,840 --> 00:45:42,640
Aerodynamics.

901
00:45:42,640 --> 00:45:45,120
Aerodynamics is not chief among them.

902
00:45:45,120 --> 00:45:48,160
No, it's a big, that's what truck nuts are all about, right?

903
00:45:49,040 --> 00:45:49,520
Yeah.

904
00:45:49,520 --> 00:45:50,320
Make it sexy.

905
00:45:51,840 --> 00:45:54,320
I don't know that anybody has ever looked at any nuts

906
00:45:54,320 --> 00:45:57,200
and been like, that's looks, that looks good to me.

907
00:45:57,200 --> 00:45:57,760
Damn.

908
00:45:58,560 --> 00:46:00,160
I'm pretty sure they're just kind of there.

909
00:46:01,600 --> 00:46:03,520
Yeah, I'm pretty sure when someone hangs truck nuts

910
00:46:03,520 --> 00:46:06,880
on their car, they're not like, ah, now people want to have sex

911
00:46:06,880 --> 00:46:07,440
with my car.

912
00:46:07,440 --> 00:46:07,920
Yes.

913
00:46:07,920 --> 00:46:09,680
People want to have sex with my car.

914
00:46:09,680 --> 00:46:12,320
You guys need to read some more of my car's fan fiction.

915
00:46:14,800 --> 00:46:16,560
If we have not talked about this before,

916
00:46:16,560 --> 00:46:18,480
I will eat my shoe on stage.

917
00:46:20,320 --> 00:46:23,760
How do you make a 2004 Honda Accord sexy as shit?

918
00:46:25,600 --> 00:46:27,440
Who is the car trying to seduce?

919
00:46:27,440 --> 00:46:28,560
I guess that's the question.

920
00:46:28,560 --> 00:46:30,080
That's the problem, right?

921
00:46:30,080 --> 00:46:32,400
You got to cover all your bases.

922
00:46:32,400 --> 00:46:33,040
Truck nuts.

923
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:36,640
Yabo, like Travis has suggested.

924
00:46:36,640 --> 00:46:39,440
Pictures of, you know, Lola Bunny from Space Jam.

925
00:46:42,160 --> 00:46:44,560
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

926
00:46:44,560 --> 00:46:45,120
That's it.

927
00:46:47,120 --> 00:46:49,520
I will say that did get the biggest reaction

928
00:46:49,520 --> 00:46:51,840
from our audience of everything we've said so far.

929
00:46:51,840 --> 00:46:53,600
Just those three things.

930
00:46:56,400 --> 00:46:57,600
Covers the gamut.

931
00:46:58,640 --> 00:46:59,840
And teach it taekwondo.

932
00:47:00,480 --> 00:47:01,520
Teaching, what's that?

933
00:47:01,520 --> 00:47:02,720
And teach it taekwondo.

934
00:47:02,720 --> 00:47:03,040
Okay.

935
00:47:03,040 --> 00:47:06,640
And teach it taekwondo, because that's something

936
00:47:06,640 --> 00:47:10,720
that a lot of people find very attractive.

937
00:47:10,720 --> 00:47:12,000
Okay, the other three things.

938
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:14,400
A picture of Justin doing a spin kick.

939
00:47:14,400 --> 00:47:16,000
Not me, not me, not me, not me, not me, not me, not me.

940
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:18,560
Just like, teach the car taekwondo.

941
00:47:19,600 --> 00:47:20,800
Or how to play guitar.

942
00:47:21,600 --> 00:47:22,560
Cars can't play guitar.

943
00:47:22,560 --> 00:47:24,160
There's no way that makes sense.

944
00:47:24,160 --> 00:47:25,760
We're being redundant.

945
00:47:25,760 --> 00:47:27,440
This thing's got Lola Bunny in it.

946
00:47:27,440 --> 00:47:29,920
Wait, is Lola Bunny in the car?

947
00:47:29,920 --> 00:47:31,600
Yeah, I'm going to go cash the checks.

948
00:47:31,600 --> 00:47:33,760
Yeah, I'm going to go cash the checks right now.

949
00:47:35,600 --> 00:47:38,640
So you get in the car and Lola Bunny's just sitting in it?

950
00:47:39,520 --> 00:47:39,760
Yeah.

951
00:47:41,920 --> 00:47:42,720
But how?

952
00:47:42,720 --> 00:47:44,720
Are we in a cool world scenario?

953
00:47:45,360 --> 00:47:47,040
I'm so glad you've asked.

954
00:47:48,240 --> 00:47:48,480
No.

955
00:47:51,040 --> 00:47:53,520
So then, how?

956
00:47:54,240 --> 00:47:56,560
This is a fucking joke podcast, Travis.

957
00:47:57,120 --> 00:47:59,200
We weave magical fantasies.

958
00:47:59,200 --> 00:48:01,280
Let him have it.

959
00:48:01,280 --> 00:48:02,960
Let the boy have his tapestries.

960
00:48:04,160 --> 00:48:05,040
Please, Travis.

961
00:48:05,840 --> 00:48:06,960
We gotta do audience questions.

962
00:48:06,960 --> 00:48:09,520
Yes, we have a handful of audience questions picked out.

963
00:48:09,520 --> 00:48:11,600
We're going to call you down by name and seat number.

964
00:48:11,600 --> 00:48:13,360
And can we get house lights turned up?

965
00:48:13,360 --> 00:48:14,560
Because I do not know where the microphones are.

966
00:48:14,560 --> 00:48:15,920
I see there's one right there.

967
00:48:15,920 --> 00:48:16,960
Probably one right there.

968
00:48:16,960 --> 00:48:17,360
Hi.

969
00:48:17,360 --> 00:48:18,240
Hello.

970
00:48:18,240 --> 00:48:20,960
I got really scared for a second that you weren't going to say anything.

971
00:48:20,960 --> 00:48:21,520
Yeah, what's up?

972
00:48:22,560 --> 00:48:23,600
What's your name?

973
00:48:23,600 --> 00:48:24,160
Douglas.

974
00:48:24,160 --> 00:48:25,040
Douglas, hi.

975
00:48:25,040 --> 00:48:25,280
Hi.

976
00:48:25,280 --> 00:48:30,000
Hi, so my husband thinks he's allergic to corn.

977
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:30,240
Okay.

978
00:48:31,760 --> 00:48:32,400
Is he?

979
00:48:32,400 --> 00:48:32,800
Is he?

980
00:48:33,760 --> 00:48:35,120
Wait, are you asking us?

981
00:48:35,760 --> 00:48:37,200
Ah, damn, Douglas.

982
00:48:37,920 --> 00:48:38,640
Okay, wait.

983
00:48:38,640 --> 00:48:39,120
Damn.

984
00:48:39,760 --> 00:48:43,440
Are you saying that this is a completely untested theory?

985
00:48:43,440 --> 00:48:44,720
That your husband has-

986
00:48:44,720 --> 00:48:46,400
Well, let's not fucking risk it.

987
00:48:46,400 --> 00:48:47,840
If he's living a corn-free life.

988
00:48:49,840 --> 00:48:53,200
At this point, probably he does not build up the tolerance to corn.

989
00:48:53,200 --> 00:48:53,680
Yeah.

990
00:48:53,680 --> 00:48:55,920
Douglas, the facts are these.

991
00:48:57,280 --> 00:48:58,000
The floor is yours.

992
00:48:58,640 --> 00:48:59,280
Oh, okay.

993
00:48:59,280 --> 00:49:00,080
We don't know the facts.

994
00:49:01,280 --> 00:49:03,280
Vis-a-vis corn allergens.

995
00:49:03,920 --> 00:49:06,400
So he's been having a hard time sleeping at night.

996
00:49:09,360 --> 00:49:11,600
And you think corn will make it easier for him to sleep?

997
00:49:14,240 --> 00:49:18,960
Well, he traced it first to the night that he had a hard time sleeping,

998
00:49:18,960 --> 00:49:20,880
he would eat a whole bag of Doritos.

999
00:49:20,880 --> 00:49:24,160
And hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on.

1000
00:49:24,160 --> 00:49:26,720
Somebody, and I don't want to know who,

1001
00:49:26,720 --> 00:49:29,280
because I will bring the wrath of God down on whoever,

1002
00:49:29,280 --> 00:49:30,080
which one of the two.

1003
00:49:31,120 --> 00:49:33,200
Your first thought was,

1004
00:49:33,200 --> 00:49:36,080
the vegetable that went into these must be bad.

1005
00:49:41,440 --> 00:49:43,760
Yeah, can't fault you there.

1006
00:49:46,160 --> 00:49:47,840
So he stopped doing that?

1007
00:49:47,840 --> 00:49:48,400
Yeah.

1008
00:49:48,400 --> 00:49:48,960
I'm sorry.

1009
00:49:48,960 --> 00:49:51,920
He stopped doing that.

1010
00:49:51,920 --> 00:49:53,680
Stopped eating Doritos late at night.

1011
00:49:53,680 --> 00:49:55,520
An entire bag before bed?

1012
00:49:55,520 --> 00:49:56,000
Yes.

1013
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:56,720
An entire bag before bed.

1014
00:49:56,720 --> 00:50:01,040
Probably in the bed under the covers where you can't see and God can't either.

1015
00:50:03,840 --> 00:50:04,160
Okay.

1016
00:50:06,080 --> 00:50:08,640
So then it shifted to on taco night,

1017
00:50:08,640 --> 00:50:10,560
he then started having trouble sleeping.

1018
00:50:11,360 --> 00:50:14,880
And he cited the corn tortilla chips.

1019
00:50:14,880 --> 00:50:16,960
I mean, that's some Dr. Howe shit right there.

1020
00:50:16,960 --> 00:50:18,400
Yeah, right there.

1021
00:50:18,400 --> 00:50:18,720
Yeah.

1022
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:23,280
Douglas, first off,

1023
00:50:23,920 --> 00:50:27,600
why is it that when we eat pretty much every meal, it's dinner,

1024
00:50:27,600 --> 00:50:29,440
but when we have tacos, it's a day?

1025
00:50:31,280 --> 00:50:32,320
You notice that?

1026
00:50:32,320 --> 00:50:34,880
Anyway, that's my five minutes, everybody.

1027
00:50:34,880 --> 00:50:35,200
Thanks.

1028
00:50:35,200 --> 00:50:35,920
That's my time.

1029
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:43,040
Douglas, I think that your husband should eat some corn.

1030
00:50:44,080 --> 00:50:46,160
And I don't mean tacos, okay?

1031
00:50:46,160 --> 00:50:48,560
And I don't mean Doritos.

1032
00:50:48,560 --> 00:50:49,680
No, here's what you got.

1033
00:50:49,680 --> 00:50:52,480
It's like if I was at a test to see if I'm allergic to potatoes,

1034
00:50:52,480 --> 00:50:53,760
I wouldn't eat Pringles.

1035
00:50:53,760 --> 00:50:56,560
Yeah, I would just maybe try this one.

1036
00:50:57,440 --> 00:50:58,240
Corn.

1037
00:50:58,800 --> 00:50:59,600
Or, or.

1038
00:50:59,600 --> 00:51:03,040
Because it's possible that your husband is just allergic to being flavor blasted.

1039
00:51:03,040 --> 00:51:03,600
Maybe.

1040
00:51:03,600 --> 00:51:06,400
Travis has the right...

1041
00:51:06,400 --> 00:51:10,400
Take the Doritos, run them under some sink water for a little bit,

1042
00:51:10,400 --> 00:51:15,040
then force feed them to him because he's not going to want to eat them.

1043
00:51:15,040 --> 00:51:16,880
Kind of want to eat them, they're going to look real bad.

1044
00:51:17,440 --> 00:51:20,560
It's going to be a real spoonful of sugar situation to get those,

1045
00:51:20,560 --> 00:51:21,600
those wet guys down.

1046
00:51:21,600 --> 00:51:22,160
So hopefully...

1047
00:51:22,160 --> 00:51:23,520
Maybe just try corn.

1048
00:51:23,520 --> 00:51:25,120
Yeah, just try corn also could do it.

1049
00:51:25,120 --> 00:51:25,760
Does that help?

1050
00:51:27,120 --> 00:51:30,080
We did, and he still came to this conclusion.

1051
00:51:30,080 --> 00:51:30,400
Okay.

1052
00:51:30,960 --> 00:51:32,080
Oh no, wait, hold on.

1053
00:51:32,080 --> 00:51:37,280
What kind of reaction did, did your husband have from the straight pure from the source?

1054
00:51:37,280 --> 00:51:38,560
Uncut corn.

1055
00:51:38,560 --> 00:51:39,680
Uncut corn.

1056
00:51:41,120 --> 00:51:42,640
He just couldn't sleep that night.

1057
00:51:43,920 --> 00:51:44,240
Okay.

1058
00:51:44,240 --> 00:51:44,880
Okay.

1059
00:51:44,880 --> 00:51:50,880
Now when you say couldn't sleep, was he having them corn worries?

1060
00:51:50,880 --> 00:51:51,120
Yeah.

1061
00:51:51,920 --> 00:51:55,520
Because sometimes I get them corn worries real bad and I can't sleep either.

1062
00:51:55,520 --> 00:51:58,880
Travis gets the pain in his corn worries.

1063
00:51:58,880 --> 00:52:01,040
I get them corn worries going.

1064
00:52:01,040 --> 00:52:03,920
Get a knock on my phone at three in the morning

1065
00:52:03,920 --> 00:52:07,360
and it's my brother telling me he's got them darn corn worries.

1066
00:52:09,440 --> 00:52:12,320
Hey, it's old Travis, I got them corn worries.

1067
00:52:12,320 --> 00:52:16,400
Corn worries keeping me awake, troubling my brain with them corn worries.

1068
00:52:16,400 --> 00:52:17,840
And make his body sick.

1069
00:52:18,720 --> 00:52:19,520
Them corn worries.

1070
00:52:19,520 --> 00:52:22,800
Oh, I got them corn troubles deep down in my belly guts.

1071
00:52:22,800 --> 00:52:24,160
Deep down corn worries.

1072
00:52:24,160 --> 00:52:28,000
Oh, in the heart of my soul feeling them corn worries.

1073
00:52:29,840 --> 00:52:30,880
Troubling me.

1074
00:52:30,880 --> 00:52:31,840
Troubling his dreams.

1075
00:52:31,840 --> 00:52:33,280
Troubling right my head.

1076
00:52:33,280 --> 00:52:34,640
Oh no, everybody left.

1077
00:52:36,720 --> 00:52:37,840
Douglas, does that help?

1078
00:52:38,640 --> 00:52:39,280
Thank you.

1079
00:52:39,280 --> 00:52:43,120
Thank you.

1080
00:52:43,120 --> 00:52:47,200
That is the least actionable thing we've ever said on this show.

1081
00:52:47,200 --> 00:52:47,600
Hello.

1082
00:52:48,880 --> 00:52:49,360
Hello.

1083
00:52:49,360 --> 00:52:50,320
Who are you?

1084
00:52:50,320 --> 00:52:51,120
I am Cody.

1085
00:52:51,120 --> 00:52:52,160
Hi, Cody.

1086
00:52:52,160 --> 00:52:52,960
What's your question?

1087
00:52:53,920 --> 00:52:57,280
How do I get my dad to stop buttering his toast with his fingers?

1088
00:53:02,800 --> 00:53:05,600
Now that was the one sentence you sent us.

1089
00:53:05,600 --> 00:53:07,600
Are there no additional details?

1090
00:53:07,600 --> 00:53:09,760
What are the other details?

1091
00:53:10,320 --> 00:53:10,960
Guys, hold on.

1092
00:53:10,960 --> 00:53:11,760
Devil's advocate.

1093
00:53:11,760 --> 00:53:13,360
What the fuck else do we need to know?

1094
00:53:14,080 --> 00:53:15,680
Wait, is it country croc?

1095
00:53:15,680 --> 00:53:16,480
No, we got-

1096
00:53:16,480 --> 00:53:19,760
Well, what does your dad say when you're like, a knife?

1097
00:53:20,880 --> 00:53:24,400
Apparently people can be allergic to corn by just not sleeping.

1098
00:53:24,400 --> 00:53:26,160
Maybe the dad's allergic to knives.

1099
00:53:27,200 --> 00:53:30,000
Most people are allergic to knives if you think about it.

1100
00:53:30,960 --> 00:53:32,240
My only weakness.

1101
00:53:32,240 --> 00:53:35,840
Julius Caesar wasn't like, how did you know?

1102
00:53:40,880 --> 00:53:41,600
Hey, though.

1103
00:53:41,600 --> 00:53:43,440
Hey, Cody, though, for real?

1104
00:53:43,440 --> 00:53:44,000
For real?

1105
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:44,560
Why?

1106
00:53:45,840 --> 00:53:46,640
Why does it happen like this?

1107
00:53:46,640 --> 00:53:48,080
Answer for your dad's crimes, Cody.

1108
00:53:49,840 --> 00:53:51,600
I think he just doesn't want to do dishes.

1109
00:53:52,320 --> 00:53:55,680
All right, now your dad's my fucking absolute dog.

1110
00:53:55,680 --> 00:53:56,180
Yes.

1111
00:53:57,440 --> 00:53:59,760
God gave us plates and knives.

1112
00:53:59,760 --> 00:54:00,260
And cutlery.

1113
00:54:00,260 --> 00:54:02,480
Plates and knives. And cups.

1114
00:54:04,880 --> 00:54:05,600
And forks.

1115
00:54:07,680 --> 00:54:08,720
Can I say something?

1116
00:54:09,360 --> 00:54:10,560
I respect this.

1117
00:54:11,440 --> 00:54:13,600
I do because I hate that.

1118
00:54:13,600 --> 00:54:16,320
When I make toast for my daughter every morning,

1119
00:54:16,320 --> 00:54:18,720
and there's like one thing that the knife does,

1120
00:54:18,720 --> 00:54:20,640
and then it has to go in the sink for that?

1121
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:23,200
Just good old butter?

1122
00:54:24,080 --> 00:54:25,360
That didn't hurt nobody.

1123
00:54:25,360 --> 00:54:26,880
Butter don't give no one worries.

1124
00:54:26,880 --> 00:54:27,920
My friend, butter?

1125
00:54:27,920 --> 00:54:32,000
Hey, one thing you could try is give your dad spray butter.

1126
00:54:33,040 --> 00:54:34,000
Because that tastes-

1127
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:35,760
He just sprayed on his fucking fingers.

1128
00:54:35,760 --> 00:54:37,120
He likes the feel of it now.

1129
00:54:39,120 --> 00:54:41,040
What about Wolverine claws?

1130
00:54:41,040 --> 00:54:42,320
Wolverine claws.

1131
00:54:42,320 --> 00:54:44,080
Now he's got the knife baked in.

1132
00:54:44,080 --> 00:54:47,360
Cody, I once watched my dad put butter on a Pop-Tart.

1133
00:54:47,360 --> 00:54:52,560
So I guess what I'm saying is it could be worse.

1134
00:54:52,560 --> 00:54:54,880
Yeah, your dad could be our dad.

1135
00:54:54,880 --> 00:54:56,080
Your dad could be our dad.

1136
00:54:56,080 --> 00:54:57,920
That's for still counting your blessings.

1137
00:54:57,920 --> 00:54:59,360
Count your blessings.

1138
00:54:59,360 --> 00:55:00,080
Does your dad-

1139
00:55:01,520 --> 00:55:02,640
Hey, we should have asked earlier.

1140
00:55:02,640 --> 00:55:03,440
Is your dad nasty?

1141
00:55:06,640 --> 00:55:08,960
I know nobody likes to wonder whether or not

1142
00:55:08,960 --> 00:55:10,400
their folks are nasty,

1143
00:55:10,400 --> 00:55:12,560
but there comes a day when everyone must look

1144
00:55:12,560 --> 00:55:14,000
in that deep dark truth from here and say,

1145
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:15,200
do I have nasty folks?

1146
00:55:16,160 --> 00:55:17,280
You got a nasty dad?

1147
00:55:17,280 --> 00:55:18,000
You got a nasty dad?

1148
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:18,880
You can tell me, Cody.

1149
00:55:18,880 --> 00:55:19,600
It's just us.

1150
00:55:20,320 --> 00:55:21,200
Everybody plug your ears.

1151
00:55:21,200 --> 00:55:21,760
Close your ears.

1152
00:55:21,760 --> 00:55:22,480
Close your ears, everybody.

1153
00:55:22,480 --> 00:55:24,400
Cody's gonna tell me he's got a nasty dad.

1154
00:55:24,400 --> 00:55:25,840
Hey folks, don't close your ears.

1155
00:55:25,840 --> 00:55:27,280
You paid a lot of money for these tickets.

1156
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:30,640
You deserve to find out if Cody's dad is nasty or not.

1157
00:55:30,640 --> 00:55:30,960
Yeah.

1158
00:55:30,960 --> 00:55:32,080
Cody, expose your dad.

1159
00:55:34,960 --> 00:55:35,760
Show us your dad.

1160
00:55:37,680 --> 00:55:38,320
Cody?

1161
00:55:38,320 --> 00:55:38,800
Nasty.

1162
00:55:40,320 --> 00:55:41,120
Oh, he's nasty.

1163
00:55:42,880 --> 00:55:43,440
Okay.

1164
00:55:44,080 --> 00:55:46,160
There's no fixing nasty, Cody.

1165
00:55:46,160 --> 00:55:48,080
There's no fixing that.

1166
00:55:48,080 --> 00:55:48,880
Does that help?

1167
00:55:49,680 --> 00:55:50,960
You've helped me, Cody.

1168
00:55:50,960 --> 00:55:51,360
Thank you.

1169
00:55:51,360 --> 00:55:52,080
Thank you, Cody.

1170
00:55:52,080 --> 00:55:53,760
You and your nasty dad.

1171
00:55:53,760 --> 00:55:54,240
Okay.

1172
00:55:54,240 --> 00:55:54,880
Final question.

1173
00:55:54,880 --> 00:55:56,000
Hello.

1174
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:56,800
Hi, my name is Renee.

1175
00:55:56,800 --> 00:55:58,000
I use she, her pronouns.

1176
00:55:58,000 --> 00:55:58,320
Thank you.

1177
00:55:58,320 --> 00:55:59,200
Hi, Renee.

1178
00:55:59,200 --> 00:55:59,760
Renee, yes.

1179
00:55:59,760 --> 00:56:00,480
Hello, Renee.

1180
00:56:00,480 --> 00:56:00,880
Hello.

1181
00:56:00,880 --> 00:56:03,200
So I work at a summer camp in upstate New York.

1182
00:56:03,200 --> 00:56:05,280
And my first summer there, we were getting all the cabins

1183
00:56:05,280 --> 00:56:07,680
ready and I noticed that there were just coffee

1184
00:56:07,680 --> 00:56:09,200
cans in all the cabins.

1185
00:56:09,200 --> 00:56:11,200
So I asked my boss what they were for.

1186
00:56:11,200 --> 00:56:14,000
And he told me that there, in case a bat gets in the building

1187
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:16,480
at night, we have to catch it with the coffee can.

1188
00:56:17,920 --> 00:56:19,680
And I thought he was kidding and he's not.

1189
00:56:19,680 --> 00:56:21,760
This is in line with like CDC requirements.

1190
00:56:22,560 --> 00:56:24,400
So we didn't have any bats the first summer,

1191
00:56:24,400 --> 00:56:26,720
but I'm going back the next summer.

1192
00:56:26,720 --> 00:56:30,240
So I would like some assistance because I need to know

1193
00:56:30,240 --> 00:56:32,560
how to catch the bat with just the coffee can

1194
00:56:32,560 --> 00:56:34,960
and like 10 or so 11-year-olds.

1195
00:56:34,960 --> 00:56:36,880
Because if I cannot catch the bat-

1196
00:56:36,880 --> 00:56:38,640
Yeah, you come to the right place.

1197
00:56:38,640 --> 00:56:41,280
Everyone in the room has to go on rabies medicine

1198
00:56:41,280 --> 00:56:41,840
and I don't want that.

1199
00:56:41,840 --> 00:56:43,040
Holy shit.

1200
00:56:43,040 --> 00:56:43,520
Yeah.

1201
00:56:43,520 --> 00:56:44,720
You should quit.

1202
00:56:44,720 --> 00:56:45,040
Yeah.

1203
00:56:46,080 --> 00:56:49,840
That's the highest stake job I've ever heard.

1204
00:56:49,840 --> 00:56:50,320
Yeah.

1205
00:56:50,320 --> 00:56:52,800
And my sister-in-law is a doctor.

1206
00:56:52,800 --> 00:56:56,960
Is, sorry, did you say the CDC requires it?

1207
00:56:57,840 --> 00:56:58,080
Yeah.

1208
00:56:58,080 --> 00:57:01,120
The CDC suggests even if a bat like swoops by your head,

1209
00:57:01,120 --> 00:57:01,920
you should get rabies.

1210
00:57:01,920 --> 00:57:05,920
Oh, I thought you said the CDC suggested it's chill.

1211
00:57:05,920 --> 00:57:06,960
Keep a coffee can.

1212
00:57:08,720 --> 00:57:11,840
My understanding is the state of New York requires that.

1213
00:57:11,840 --> 00:57:13,920
Do you know there's better things to catch things?

1214
00:57:15,200 --> 00:57:16,400
They make nets.

1215
00:57:16,400 --> 00:57:17,920
They've chosen a device.

1216
00:57:18,480 --> 00:57:21,680
The aperture of which is about bat sized.

1217
00:57:21,680 --> 00:57:24,480
What they've given you is a fucking carnival game.

1218
00:57:27,120 --> 00:57:31,520
You're playing fucking mini golf with a bat.

1219
00:57:31,520 --> 00:57:32,080
Oh, man.

1220
00:57:32,080 --> 00:57:33,200
Get the 10-year-olds together.

1221
00:57:34,720 --> 00:57:36,960
Tell them that the bat knows where to go play Fortnite.

1222
00:57:40,320 --> 00:57:41,440
And then your job is done.

1223
00:57:42,320 --> 00:57:45,040
Those little bastards will be flying around the room.

1224
00:57:45,040 --> 00:57:49,520
Fill the coffee can halfway up with lizard tails.

1225
00:57:49,520 --> 00:57:52,320
Bat flies in.

1226
00:57:52,320 --> 00:57:53,680
You could lure the bat.

1227
00:57:53,680 --> 00:57:55,280
What does the bat crave?

1228
00:57:55,280 --> 00:57:55,920
Fear?

1229
00:57:55,920 --> 00:57:56,420
Yes.

1230
00:57:58,000 --> 00:57:58,800
Bugs?

1231
00:57:58,800 --> 00:57:59,360
Yes.

1232
00:57:59,360 --> 00:58:00,240
The Joker.

1233
00:58:00,240 --> 00:58:00,880
The Joker.

1234
00:58:01,600 --> 00:58:02,320
Could you fill...

1235
00:58:03,680 --> 00:58:04,880
Batman, love it.

1236
00:58:04,880 --> 00:58:05,200
Okay.

1237
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:08,160
You can say the bat and I only know one of the bats.

1238
00:58:08,160 --> 00:58:11,760
Could you fill the jar with bugs and just he goes into the jar?

1239
00:58:12,880 --> 00:58:14,560
I mean, hypothetically, yes.

1240
00:58:14,560 --> 00:58:17,680
What about just a sign on the front door that says bugs are outside?

1241
00:58:17,680 --> 00:58:19,680
That's good.

1242
00:58:19,680 --> 00:58:20,960
But it has to be...

1243
00:58:20,960 --> 00:58:21,600
In bat.

1244
00:58:21,600 --> 00:58:22,560
It has to be...

1245
00:58:22,560 --> 00:58:25,520
No, it has to be bumpy so they can read it with echolocation.

1246
00:58:27,520 --> 00:58:28,480
Raised letters.

1247
00:58:28,480 --> 00:58:28,960
Raised letters.

1248
00:58:28,960 --> 00:58:29,520
Raised letters.

1249
00:58:29,520 --> 00:58:30,320
So important.

1250
00:58:30,320 --> 00:58:30,820
Ah!

1251
00:58:32,720 --> 00:58:33,920
They don't have any bugs in there.

1252
00:58:33,920 --> 00:58:35,200
I know because I yelled at it.

1253
00:58:36,160 --> 00:58:38,960
I yelled at it real good with my voice ears.

1254
00:58:38,960 --> 00:58:41,200
Get a fake bat and nail it to the wall.

1255
00:58:41,200 --> 00:58:43,200
And then when the bat comes in, just point at it.

1256
00:58:44,800 --> 00:58:45,680
That's you.

1257
00:58:45,680 --> 00:58:46,640
I did that.

1258
00:58:46,640 --> 00:58:47,440
You're next.

1259
00:58:47,440 --> 00:58:53,840
Is there an animal on Earth that when you look at Google pictures of it, looks so cute,

1260
00:58:53,840 --> 00:58:58,240
but then when one just shows up, it's the worst shit in the whole fucking world?

1261
00:58:58,240 --> 00:58:58,800
Babies.

1262
00:59:03,520 --> 00:59:05,440
Woof, woof, woof.

1263
00:59:05,440 --> 00:59:06,160
Rough stuff.

1264
00:59:06,160 --> 00:59:07,280
I love my daughter very much.

1265
00:59:07,280 --> 00:59:09,920
Yeah, put that shit on a fucking Hot Topic t-shirt.

1266
00:59:09,920 --> 00:59:10,960
Let's start flinging them.

1267
00:59:12,160 --> 00:59:13,600
Renee, does that help?

1268
00:59:13,600 --> 00:59:14,400
Yes, thank you.

1269
00:59:14,400 --> 00:59:15,120
Thank you, Renee.

1270
00:59:15,120 --> 00:59:17,360
Uh, folks, this has been so fun.

1271
00:59:18,400 --> 00:59:22,800
Birmingham, you are a, I'm gonna go ahead and say a hoot, if I may.

1272
00:59:22,800 --> 00:59:23,840
And you know what?

1273
00:59:23,840 --> 00:59:24,800
And a holler.

1274
00:59:24,800 --> 00:59:27,520
I could get used to this wild Alabama energy.

1275
00:59:27,520 --> 00:59:28,560
This is very good.

1276
00:59:32,800 --> 00:59:38,480
And hey, just for laughs, if 400 of you wanted to come kick it in New Orleans,

1277
00:59:38,480 --> 00:59:42,960
so we would love to have, we could probably get like a caravan,

1278
00:59:42,960 --> 00:59:45,920
like some kind of like car sharing thing going.

1279
00:59:45,920 --> 00:59:46,720
It'll be fun.

1280
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:50,000
If you already have tickets for the New Orleans show,

1281
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:53,360
just turn to someone to your left or right and say, what it come with?

1282
00:59:53,360 --> 00:59:56,080
Unless, let us check what percentage we're at.

1283
00:59:58,720 --> 01:00:02,560
Because if we can pull off the Grand Prix and get all three.

1284
01:00:04,960 --> 01:00:07,040
Thank you to John Roderick and the Long Linters for these.

1285
01:00:07,040 --> 01:00:09,440
For our theme song, it's a departure of the old days to bed.

1286
01:00:09,440 --> 01:00:15,120
And thank you to Sawbones and Schmaners for crushing it.

1287
01:00:17,520 --> 01:00:20,880
Thank you to all of our wives and families without whom's permission,

1288
01:00:20,880 --> 01:00:21,760
we would not be here.

1289
01:00:21,760 --> 01:00:23,200
Permissions are weird.

1290
01:00:23,200 --> 01:00:27,120
I know, I started the sentence and then I couldn't, without whose blessing?

1291
01:00:27,680 --> 01:00:28,000
Worse.

1292
01:00:30,560 --> 01:00:31,520
Thank you to Paul Seborin.

1293
01:00:31,520 --> 01:00:32,720
Thank you to Paul Seborin.

1294
01:00:32,720 --> 01:00:33,680
We can all live on that.

1295
01:00:36,240 --> 01:00:38,480
Thank you to Amanda, who helps us put shows together.

1296
01:00:38,480 --> 01:00:39,840
Yes, Amanda, thank you to CA.

1297
01:00:39,840 --> 01:00:42,560
And thank you to this beautiful, beautiful theater

1298
01:00:42,560 --> 01:00:44,080
and the people who had us here to do a show.

1299
01:00:44,080 --> 01:00:44,960
It's been super fun.

1300
01:00:44,960 --> 01:00:45,280
Thank you.

1301
01:00:46,880 --> 01:00:49,680
Every week on My Brother, My Brother and Me,

1302
01:00:49,680 --> 01:00:53,040
my brother Griffin reads a final Yahoo that we think about

1303
01:00:53,040 --> 01:00:55,200
then we come back to the next day to discuss it.

1304
01:00:56,880 --> 01:00:58,800
We will be doing that now.

1305
01:00:59,520 --> 01:00:59,760
Sam.

1306
01:00:59,760 --> 01:01:01,600
Oh wait, we almost forgot the posters.

1307
01:01:01,600 --> 01:01:02,800
The posters, holy shit.

1308
01:01:02,800 --> 01:01:04,000
Please get the posters there.

1309
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:04,720
I need to say, I did those.

1310
01:01:04,720 --> 01:01:05,920
They're so fun.

1311
01:01:05,920 --> 01:01:06,960
I really love them.

1312
01:01:06,960 --> 01:01:07,200
Yes.

1313
01:01:07,200 --> 01:01:08,720
Here it comes from Sam.

1314
01:01:08,720 --> 01:01:09,280
Thank you, Sam.

1315
01:01:09,280 --> 01:01:13,360
It's Yahoo Answers user Kevin, who asks,

1316
01:01:14,880 --> 01:01:17,520
does peanut butter make boys bigger?

1317
01:01:21,920 --> 01:01:23,440
My name is Justin McElroy.

1318
01:01:23,440 --> 01:01:24,400
I'm Travis McElroy.

1319
01:01:24,400 --> 01:01:25,360
I'm Griffin McElroy.

1320
01:01:25,360 --> 01:01:26,480
This has been My Brother, My Brother and Me.

1321
01:01:26,480 --> 01:01:46,640
Make as you dance, grab the lamps.

1322
01:01:46,640 --> 01:01:48,560
Maximumfun.org.

1323
01:01:48,560 --> 01:01:49,600
Comedy and culture.

1324
01:01:49,600 --> 01:01:50,720
Artist owned.

1325
01:01:50,720 --> 01:01:52,240
Listener supported.

1326
01:01:52,240 --> 01:01:53,680
Since the dawn of time,

1327
01:01:53,680 --> 01:01:56,880
screenwriters have taken months to craft their stories,

1328
01:01:56,880 --> 01:01:59,680
but now three Hollywood professionals

1329
01:01:59,680 --> 01:02:01,440
shall attempt the impossible.

1330
01:02:02,080 --> 01:02:04,560
Break a story in one hour.

1331
01:02:04,560 --> 01:02:05,120
That's right.

1332
01:02:05,120 --> 01:02:07,120
Here on Story Break, I, Freddie Wong,

1333
01:02:07,120 --> 01:02:07,760
Matt Arnold,

1334
01:02:07,760 --> 01:02:08,640
and Will Campos,

1335
01:02:08,640 --> 01:02:10,480
the creators behind award-winning shows

1336
01:02:10,480 --> 01:02:11,520
like Video Game High School,

1337
01:02:11,520 --> 01:02:14,400
have one hour to turn a humble idea into an awesome movie.

1338
01:02:14,400 --> 01:02:16,960
Now, an awesome movie starts with an awesome title.

1339
01:02:16,960 --> 01:02:19,360
I chose The Billionaire's Marriage Valley.

1340
01:02:19,360 --> 01:02:22,000
Mine was Christmas Pregnant Paradise.

1341
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:24,400
Okay, next we need a protagonist.

1342
01:02:24,400 --> 01:02:27,520
So I've heard Wario best described as libertarian, Mark.

1343
01:02:28,480 --> 01:02:31,520
And of course, every great movie needs a stellar pitch.

1344
01:02:31,520 --> 01:02:32,560
In order to get to heaven,

1345
01:02:32,560 --> 01:02:34,160
sometimes you gotta raise a little hell.

1346
01:02:34,160 --> 01:02:35,840
Oh, that's the tagline!
