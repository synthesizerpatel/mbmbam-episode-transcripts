1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:29,720
It's familiar, but not too familiar, but not too not familiar.

2
00:00:29,720 --> 00:00:40,160
It's a new craze, hey good girls do you wanna just say hey I wanna, just say hey I wanna.

3
00:00:59,720 --> 00:01:24,480
Ladies and gentlemen, a guitar!

4
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:43,720
Hi, hi that was John Roderick, and thank you, hey do you want, hey John can you come out for just one second, you don't have to say anything, but I just, Griffin if you could just say it to him in person.

5
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:50,720
I wanna say thank you.

6
00:01:50,720 --> 00:02:01,720
Two, John Roderick and the Long Winter's Fuse are theme songs to the bar trophy on Pretty Days of Bed.

7
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:06,720
John flew all the way to Seattle, so honored just to play that song.

8
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:08,720
For the folks listening at home.

9
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:13,720
Hello everybody and welcome, my brother, my brother and me, an advice show for the modern era.

10
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:19,720
I'm your oldest brother Justin McElroy, if we don't do it we'll forget.

11
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:25,720
I'm your middle is brother Travis McElroy.

12
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:34,720
I'm your sweet baby brother and 30 under 30 media luminary Griffin McElroy.

13
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:51,720
For, for the folks listening at home, Justin and Travis and I just spent about 30 seconds shredding air guitars next to John as if we were showing him, this is the, this is the correct way to rock.

14
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:58,720
And for those of you at home, we fucking nailed it.

15
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:05,720
We were at the, Travis and I and our, our families, our brood, our brood.

16
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:07,720
You were invited.

17
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:12,720
We were at the Salish Lodge and Spa in Snoqualmie, Washington.

18
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:15,720
No, we were in the Great Northern and Twin Peaks.

19
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:16,720
Right.

20
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:22,720
Obviously that's part of the history of this place, but it is also like very good.

21
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:23,720
Yeah.

22
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:29,720
It's also, and you can tell that the people there have this attitude of like, yes, it was into a piece.

23
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:30,720
It also smells nice.

24
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:31,720
Yeah.

25
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:33,720
And is constantly playing spa music.

26
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:35,720
Yeah, it was like a very spa.

27
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:41,720
It's like, there's nice things and it's, we just want to say this, not spooky.

28
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:42,720
Yeah.

29
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:44,720
They really go out of their way.

30
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:47,720
When you check in, they say, here's your keys and no ghosts.

31
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:54,720
Just no ghosts. And you'll notice that key isn't a weird spirit key.

32
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:56,720
It's just a card.

33
00:03:56,720 --> 00:04:02,720
Now everything that happens beyond the threshold of this building, if you see the tree wizard,

34
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:07,720
it's been a long time since I've watched Twin Peaks.

35
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:11,720
I wanted to say that they do lean into it in weird ways.

36
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:17,720
There was, you know, the coffee that they have, like, this is how fucking fancy this place was.

37
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:18,720
Pour over, thank you.

38
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:19,720
Pour over coffee.

39
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:20,720
Thank you.

40
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:25,720
Or maybe we've just said that to everyone who lives in Seattle and they're like, there's another kind?

41
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:30,720
On the bag it said, Twin Peaks coffee.

42
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:31,720
Good start.

43
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:35,720
Twin Peaks coffee, dark and mysterious.

44
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:42,720
And then it said, the beans are not what they seem.

45
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:43,720
That's okay.

46
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:45,720
That's good.

47
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:47,720
Twin Peaks already had a coffee thing.

48
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:49,720
They already had a coffee thing.

49
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:51,720
I'm going to drink this.

50
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:53,720
So why don't you tell me what they are?

51
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:55,720
They put beans in quotes.

52
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:56,720
Beans in quotes.

53
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:57,720
The beans.

54
00:04:57,720 --> 00:04:59,720
I was like, I'm going to put this in my body.

55
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:01,720
Yeah, I'm going to put it in my body.

56
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:02,720
They're beans, right?

57
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:03,720
They're beans though, right?

58
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:04,720
You ain't fucking with me.

59
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:06,720
They're having fun here, but they're beans, aren't they?

60
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:07,720
Okay.

61
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:12,720
While you all were doing that this morning, I was flying here at a very early time and

62
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:17,720
I saw an even better thing than the great, beautiful, majestic waterfall you all saw,

63
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:22,720
which is the dude in front of me pull out the, like, entertainment screen, like literally

64
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:27,720
throws his bag up overhead, sits down, rips out the entertainment screen, starts frantically

65
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:34,720
searching and he finds Geostorm and he's like, yes, yes, yes, yes.

66
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:35,720
Geostorm.

67
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:36,720
Fuck yes.

68
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:37,720
Yes, they have it.

69
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:40,720
They have Geostorm.

70
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:41,720
They were funny.

71
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:43,720
And it was the star of Geostorm.

72
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:47,720
Fucking crazy for Geostorm.

73
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:49,720
That was so funny.

74
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:50,720
It was.

75
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:53,720
I just enjoyed it a lot.

76
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:57,720
He, almost as much as this dude, enjoyed Geostorm, which was a great deal.

77
00:05:57,720 --> 00:05:59,720
I watched Over a Lady's Shoulder.

78
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:01,720
Isn't it the best being able to, like, see what people are doing on airplanes?

79
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:02,720
Oh, yeah.

80
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:03,720
For sure.

81
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:07,720
I watched Over a Lady's Shoulder and she watched the Mr. Rogers documentary, Won't You Be My

82
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:08,720
Neighbor?

83
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:09,720
Yeah.

84
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:10,720
At 4x speed.

85
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:11,720
Yes.

86
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:17,720
I want to find out what the hubbub is on this fool.

87
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:19,720
Ain't going to spend a lot of time.

88
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:26,720
I watched a dude watch Rampage and when he got to the point where the big monkey started

89
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:32,720
fighting the big reptile, started fighting the big wolf, fast forwarded.

90
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:33,720
Too scary.

91
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:34,720
Too scary.

92
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:35,720
He was like, I get it, I get it.

93
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:36,720
Boop, boop, boop, boop, boop.

94
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:41,720
Dude, like, when it was literally all done and the rock was quipping and he was like,

95
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:42,720
play.

96
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:43,720
And I was like, wait, hold on.

97
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:48,720
Why are you watching this film?

98
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:51,240
So this is time for the podcast.

99
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:58,160
My mom commissioned and paid for a four foot wide artist rendering of a nude portrait of

100
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:06,380
herself.

101
00:07:06,380 --> 00:07:10,640
And now it's hanging on the wall in her actual home where she lives.

102
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:18,320
I'm about to move back to my hometown so I'll be in geographic proximity to this abomination.

103
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:22,240
Is there any way I can get away with destroying it?

104
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:24,680
How can I convince her this is wrong?

105
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:26,040
And that's from Annie.

106
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:28,880
Annie, are you okay?

107
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:32,160
Annie, are you here?

108
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:33,160
Okay.

109
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:34,720
Hi, Annie.

110
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:41,120
I want you to know, I hadn't thought of it before this moment, but it might be the greatest

111
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:46,520
power move I've ever heard in my entire life that like, especially if you have someone

112
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:52,360
else open the front door and then your mom's standing underneath it like this.

113
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:54,640
Like the Peter Pan pose.

114
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:55,640
Yeah.

115
00:07:55,640 --> 00:07:56,640
What's wrong?

116
00:07:56,640 --> 00:08:02,880
Especially if you have Airbnb plans for your, that's a big move.

117
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:06,080
What's that second cousin Debra I haven't talked to in forever?

118
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:09,080
You want to stay at my home for two weeks rent free?

119
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:11,000
You got it.

120
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:16,080
I guess what Travis is trying to say is Annie, why are you so threatened by your incredible

121
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:21,560
powerful sexual mom?

122
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:24,880
Your mom has power and she's owning it.

123
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:25,880
Yes.

124
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:28,640
Like a great mom should.

125
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:33,440
And is it, let me just ask this, and this is rhetorical Annie, because of course this

126
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:37,480
is in the eye of the beholder, but what if it's a good painting?

127
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:38,480
Yeah.

128
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:44,520
Have you looked at it a lot to check for brushwork and stuff?

129
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:48,460
Maybe it's a great, great nude painting of your mom.

130
00:08:48,460 --> 00:08:49,460
You know what?

131
00:08:49,460 --> 00:08:53,360
Justin has made a good point because every nude painting of a subject throughout time

132
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:57,440
has been a nude painting of someone's mom and I bet.

133
00:08:57,440 --> 00:09:01,200
That's not that what you just said is fucking complete nonsense.

134
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:02,200
Makes no sense.

135
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:04,200
What you just said was complete douchey toy stuff.

136
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:05,200
That was literal nonsense.

137
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:06,200
They can't make it up.

138
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:07,840
No, no, stop for a second.

139
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:08,840
Okay.

140
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:13,360
But think, like think about what you're saying, bud, bud, think about what you're saying bud.

141
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:16,680
They're nude portraits of Jesus's mom and everyone's okay with it.

142
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:21,120
No, bud, bud, that's not what you said, bud.

143
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:24,160
Bud, you said every nude portrait is someone's mom, bud.

144
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:25,400
I said of a subject.

145
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:26,400
I did say of a subject.

146
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:27,400
Of a subject.

147
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:28,400
You did.

148
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:29,400
But I thought about it as I was saying it.

149
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:30,400
Yeah.

150
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:31,400
Okay.

151
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:32,400
As a subject.

152
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:35,600
What I need to know is why is your brother a garbage person?

153
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:36,600
I said it.

154
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:37,600
I was right.

155
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:39,200
I thought about it.

156
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:45,160
There is a possibility that this is all okay because all that we know is that it's a four-foot

157
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:46,280
wide portrait.

158
00:09:46,280 --> 00:09:47,920
Maybe it's just one inch tall.

159
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:48,920
Yeah.

160
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:51,880
It only catches the belly button.

161
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:52,880
Yeah.

162
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:55,880
Please enjoy this magic eye painting of my naked mom.

163
00:09:55,880 --> 00:09:58,800
Cross your eyes appropriately to enjoy.

164
00:09:58,800 --> 00:09:59,920
Oh, wait, hold on.

165
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:02,280
Were you saying it's squished down?

166
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:06,480
No, I'm saying that not every subject in a nude painting is somebody's mom.

167
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:07,480
I don't understand why you're so strong.

168
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:08,480
I don't know.

169
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:09,480
It's for somebody.

170
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:10,480
Okay.

171
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:11,480
Sure.

172
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:16,960
If you put your nose on this strip of painting, you can kind of see just like wicked tall.

173
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:18,680
It's like the witness.

174
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:23,080
If you stand on those stairs, then the one painting over here and the other one line

175
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:27,880
up to make a naked picture of my mom.

176
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:28,880
Don't destroy it.

177
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:29,880
It's art.

178
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:30,880
Art.

179
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:31,880
Obviously, it's art.

180
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:32,880
You should buy it.

181
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:35,640
You should buy it.

182
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:41,160
Here's a Yahoo that was sent in by—do y'all want a Yahoo?

183
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:43,400
This one was sent in by Raimi.

184
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:44,400
Thank you, Raimi.

185
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:50,000
It's Yahoo Answers user Jonathan, who has negative five points this week.

186
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,640
Oh, no!

187
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:53,640
He's been a member—

188
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:55,220
They get worse than not answering.

189
00:10:55,220 --> 00:10:58,280
He's been a member since July 6, 2015.

190
00:10:58,280 --> 00:11:02,560
He has eight points, and he lost five this week.

191
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:06,600
Jonathan's having a tough, tough time with his Yahoo career.

192
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:12,080
Jonathan asks, no dress code funeral?

193
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:16,280
I am going to a funeral on Tuesday, and the family have said there is no dress code.

194
00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:18,240
Wear something that the deceased would have liked.

195
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:20,080
I'm a 19-year-old male.

196
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:21,080
What shall I wear?

197
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:24,400
This is how I'm going to go.

198
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:25,520
This is how I'm going to go.

199
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:26,760
Wear whatever.

200
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:29,920
Toss your peanut shells on the floor.

201
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:32,280
No rules just right.

202
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:36,040
The people working at the funeral home are going to, like, say, like, shitty things about

203
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:37,600
you, like you're at Dick's Last Resort.

204
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:38,600
It's going to be fucking hysterical.

205
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:40,920
Put a big, like, condom hat on you.

206
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:41,920
Yeah.

207
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:42,920
I love it.

208
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:46,720
This is—like, if you think about it, like, why—you would think that if we were truly

209
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:54,360
respecting the dead, that the dress code would be, like, as comfortable as possible.

210
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:57,640
Because like, if I'm dead, I think I'm the most comfortable, and I would like you to

211
00:11:57,640 --> 00:11:58,640
match.

212
00:11:58,640 --> 00:11:59,640
It's true.

213
00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:06,760
Listen, as good as a choice as this was for a live show to talk about death extensively,

214
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:09,840
which I'm loving, ba-da-ba-ba-ba, I'm loving it.

215
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:16,000
I want to—do want to get back to Griffin's point of there aren't any rules at a funeral,

216
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,520
and I feel like nobody's going to know how to act.

217
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:23,680
I feel like it might get kind of silly at the funeral, kind of maybe—the one thing

218
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:27,320
I'm worried about, and I'm sure you've already guessed it, is pranks.

219
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:32,240
That's the problem with no dress code, is it makes people feel like, so is this a prank

220
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:36,480
encouraged environment, or—they didn't send out any rules about pranks, and I feel

221
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:38,200
like it kind of left the door open.

222
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:41,400
Man, let's bail.

223
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:42,400
Let's bail.

224
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:43,400
Let's get out of this question.

225
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:44,400
No, it's good.

226
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:48,920
I do want to read this comment from my favorite Lucy, who said, you said the family said

227
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:51,040
where something the deceased would have liked.

228
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:56,920
You have told us nothing about the deceased, so how the hell are we supposed to know?

229
00:12:56,920 --> 00:12:57,920
19.

230
00:12:57,920 --> 00:12:58,920
19?

231
00:12:58,920 --> 00:12:59,920
You sound 8.

232
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:00,920
Whoa!

233
00:13:00,920 --> 00:13:01,920
Their friend just died.

234
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:02,920
This is actually a much deeper question.

235
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:03,920
Who's to judge what the deceased would like?

236
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:04,920
Yeah.

237
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:08,920
Like, is it like, where's something that maybe finally we'll get, like, that's—oh,

238
00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:20,920
that they've got a ouija board set up, and just, no, no, no, yes, no, no, no, no, no,

239
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:25,920
no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,

240
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:26,920
no, no, no.

241
00:13:26,920 --> 00:13:27,920
Yes.

242
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:28,920
Yes.

243
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:29,920
Yeah.

244
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:30,920
Yes.

245
00:13:30,920 --> 00:13:31,920
That's how they decide who gets in.

246
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:36,400
This is the kind of bouncer at the door with a ouija board.

247
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:37,400
Here's another question.

248
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:40,680
Our neighbor built his kiddo a treehouse over the summer.

249
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:42,060
It's very nice.

250
00:13:42,060 --> 00:13:48,500
It has a spiral staircase, cedar siding, a flat screen TV, its own Wi-Fi network, couches,

251
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:52,000
chairs, and a big nice window.

252
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:55,000
That's a house.

253
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,960
This is a house that a tree got up on.

254
00:13:57,960 --> 00:14:00,320
A house that does not fear the flood.

255
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:05,600
It has a big, nice window that looks directly

256
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:09,280
into my nice, small window in my bathroom.

257
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:14,280
It looks in at just the right angle.

258
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:17,320
Does it?

259
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:18,400
For what?

260
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:19,840
Here's the question.

261
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:21,480
Is this my problem?

262
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:25,160
So far, I've treated it as theirs.

263
00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:30,160
It's a bold, a bold stance.

264
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:33,080
Healthy.

265
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:34,760
Is I'm not making eye contact,

266
00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:36,860
you are an acceptable solution.

267
00:14:36,860 --> 00:14:40,820
That's from you looking at me here in row G.

268
00:14:40,820 --> 00:14:42,840
And the first thing I would say is,

269
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:44,920
you could treat it like their problem,

270
00:14:44,920 --> 00:14:46,720
it's still your butt.

271
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:51,560
When someone was done designing your house,

272
00:14:51,560 --> 00:14:52,920
and I'm like, you're gonna put a window there,

273
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:54,560
but then people can see into the bathroom,

274
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:56,520
like, yeah, but what are the odds?

275
00:14:56,520 --> 00:14:57,360
Ah, shit, man.

276
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:59,980
I do like the tall windows that we can all dream

277
00:14:59,980 --> 00:15:01,680
as we poop.

278
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:03,980
I wish I was out there like a bird.

279
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:08,640
I can't poop unless I wistfully watch a butterfly go by.

280
00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:09,480
You know this.

281
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:12,400
And I think about what it would be like to be free.

282
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:15,140
So where do you want the window?

283
00:15:15,140 --> 00:15:17,360
Well, I need to see my wishing star

284
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:19,000
when I'm sitting.

285
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:19,840
My special.

286
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:21,280
For my one song.

287
00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:22,120
I need to.

288
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:24,720
I gotta be able to pray to the man in the moon, don't I?

289
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:29,600
Yo, this is bad.

290
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:30,760
It's bad.

291
00:15:30,760 --> 00:15:34,000
Hey, one thing is curtains.

292
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,560
For them or for you?

293
00:15:36,760 --> 00:15:39,720
You were there first, don't listen to him.

294
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:42,280
It's, again, it's your butt.

295
00:15:42,280 --> 00:15:45,280
You are, you have everything to lose.

296
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:49,200
It's just their eyes.

297
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:51,640
It's just their eyes, and it's your butt.

298
00:15:51,640 --> 00:15:53,760
And it could be an attack.

299
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:56,320
Like, it's not good for you to have your butt.

300
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:58,000
If they see, that's curtains.

301
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,160
That's metaphorically speaking.

302
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:02,560
It's your butt is on the line.

303
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:04,740
They have nothing to lose.

304
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:08,480
You have to put up curtains.

305
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:12,760
Can you, and wait for me to finish

306
00:16:12,760 --> 00:16:15,440
before you, like, chide me.

307
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:18,560
Chainsaw, go to the tree.

308
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:20,720
Let me fucking finish.

309
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:22,320
You cut it across,

310
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:24,720
maybe in like the midsection of the tree.

311
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:26,440
And then you go a few feet down,

312
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:28,320
and you make another clean cut.

313
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:31,320
Karate kick that section you've just cut out.

314
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:32,640
The tree falls down again,

315
00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:35,520
breaks the sight line to your toilet zone.

316
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:40,520
I'm okay with the tree dying after that, actually.

317
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:49,080
Are you okay with the neighbor dying?

318
00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:50,400
No, absolutely not.

319
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:53,920
But then it would just become a shed at that point, right?

320
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:57,400
If tree house, no, no, no,

321
00:16:57,400 --> 00:16:59,640
tree house fall down, become shed.

322
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:04,640
But it doesn't fall down like, okay.

323
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:07,920
Tree house fall down like a Donkey Kong, become shed.

324
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,320
Tree house am shed.

325
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:11,200
It's true.

326
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:12,480
You could tell the neighbor,

327
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:14,520
if you don't get some curtains,

328
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:17,880
I'm gonna spin kick that goddamn house at that tree.

329
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:18,720
And the thing is,

330
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:21,400
nobody knows how hard anybody else can spin kick.

331
00:17:22,320 --> 00:17:24,520
They don't know if it's a hollow thread or not.

332
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:26,040
You could be one of the rare people

333
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:29,640
that can fly off your roof, jump off your roof,

334
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:31,680
spin kick the house on the tree.

335
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:33,320
I've never seen him spin kick before.

336
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:34,160
He might.

337
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:35,000
He might be able to.

338
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:35,840
I don't know how hard he can spin kick.

339
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:37,800
He ran a half marathon last year.

340
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:39,160
I don't know.

341
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:41,120
Came in 29th.

342
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:43,480
I have a Yahoo here that was sent in by Merritt Palmer.

343
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:44,320
Thank you, Merritt.

344
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:45,680
Thank you, Merritt.

345
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:49,040
It's Yahoo Answers user Katlee who asks,

346
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:52,120
what happens when the teenage mutant ninja turtles

347
00:17:52,120 --> 00:17:53,480
become adults?

348
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:58,040
Are they just mutant ninja turtles?

349
00:17:58,040 --> 00:18:03,040
You always hear about the last three words in the title.

350
00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:12,520
Is there anything about their whole shit

351
00:18:12,520 --> 00:18:14,600
that would change if they...

352
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:16,000
I don't think of them as being

353
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,880
between the ages of 13 and 19.

354
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:21,360
They're gigantic, muscular, green monsters.

355
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:23,440
And is it in turtle years?

356
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:25,360
Who even knows at that point?

357
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:26,200
They're two?

358
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:27,520
Two?

359
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:30,520
Or they might be 200 because tortoises go forever.

360
00:18:30,520 --> 00:18:33,200
They go a long time.

361
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:35,200
This is the argument that I would make.

362
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:39,840
Once they are at a point along their lifespan

363
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:42,880
where they are no longer comfortable being called teenage.

364
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:45,440
Well, for one, they may love it.

365
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:47,440
I know that I would love if someone

366
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:48,800
must look me for a teenager.

367
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:50,320
When I get carded?

368
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:52,000
Yeah, so flattering.

369
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:56,000
But they may not necessarily like any of it.

370
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:01,000
Like, they may not want to be mutants or ninjas or...

371
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:02,520
I'm obviously not a turtle.

372
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:03,360
How about this?

373
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:05,160
How about instead of mutant ninja turtle,

374
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:07,320
how about Donatello?

375
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:11,320
How about there's only four of us,

376
00:19:11,320 --> 00:19:14,240
we're all named after painters, fuck.

377
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:17,040
Just learn our names and say like,

378
00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:20,560
Raphael, you are cool, but rude.

379
00:19:20,560 --> 00:19:21,720
That's easy to remember.

380
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:24,040
And he would say, yeah, I have a lot to work on.

381
00:19:24,040 --> 00:19:25,840
Yeah, I have been talking to somebody.

382
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:27,960
Yeah, it's my struggle.

383
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:29,600
Pizza, are you kidding me?

384
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:30,760
With my acid reflux?

385
00:19:30,760 --> 00:19:31,600
No, thanks.

386
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:35,640
You know what I wish people would pour down the sewers more?

387
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:37,560
Is bisque.

388
00:19:37,560 --> 00:19:40,600
Drop that down in the sewer, yes.

389
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:44,320
A shredder and the foot clan are terrorizing the city?

390
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:45,720
Call the police.

391
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:46,880
Yes, call the police.

392
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:49,000
It's past nine o'clock.

393
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,640
After nine o'clock.

394
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:52,160
Are you kidding me?

395
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:53,880
Survivors back.

396
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:56,040
What?

397
00:19:56,040 --> 00:19:58,560
Survivors back, by the way, tonight.

398
00:19:58,560 --> 00:19:59,400
Catch it.

399
00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:01,560
I tell you what I feel bad for

400
00:20:01,560 --> 00:20:04,440
is the group that sings the theme song

401
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:07,360
because you know it'll take them a bit.

402
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:09,440
There'll be a lot of like,

403
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:11,400
mutant ninja turtles.

404
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:13,640
It'll be the P-I-N-G-O.

405
00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:15,400
Teen, damn it, Ryan.

406
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:17,120
What the fuck?

407
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:19,520
I just know the old way, so I'm good.

408
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:22,360
What could they replace?

409
00:20:22,360 --> 00:20:24,280
Two syllables, they need two syllables.

410
00:20:24,280 --> 00:20:25,960
I mean adult, but that's not good.

411
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:28,400
People who are doing their best.

412
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:30,880
People who are doing their best.

413
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:32,240
They are just people.

414
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:34,400
Watch us accept them.

415
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:35,640
Turtle power, fuck.

416
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:37,120
Okay, that still is good.

417
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:38,320
We're gonna, yeah.

418
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:39,880
Do you think that it was,

419
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:42,720
that the name built as they got older

420
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:44,520
or that it was aspirational?

421
00:20:44,520 --> 00:20:46,000
That Splinter found them and said,

422
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:49,080
someday you will be teenager ninja turtles.

423
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,400
What about after that?

424
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:52,440
Let's listen.

425
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:54,680
Three of you.

426
00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:56,280
The sewers are terrible

427
00:20:56,280 --> 00:20:59,320
and you fight a guy that's made of swords.

428
00:20:59,320 --> 00:21:01,560
Let's not get ahead of ourselves, okay?

429
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:05,000
You should be pretty,

430
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:08,040
honestly, you were raised to this point by a rat.

431
00:21:08,040 --> 00:21:09,800
You should be pretty fucking gized

432
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:11,000
about getting to teenage.

433
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:15,640
Your dad's a rat, okay?

434
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:20,040
Hey, hold on a second.

435
00:21:20,040 --> 00:21:22,960
Why do they wear masks?

436
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:27,960
Who is gonna be like, who are those anonymous crusaders?

437
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:39,160
I saw them at the market just the other day.

438
00:21:40,040 --> 00:21:41,680
No, couldn't be them.

439
00:21:41,680 --> 00:21:44,520
I'm friends with four human turtles

440
00:21:44,520 --> 00:21:46,200
that have ninja skills,

441
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:47,760
but that can't be you.

442
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:51,240
Not without the mask.

443
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:54,240
You're in a suit.

444
00:21:55,320 --> 00:21:58,960
Can't be, you can't be the brave crusaders.

445
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:01,600
Here you are applying for a loan.

446
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:02,920
Couldn't be you.

447
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:07,560
Ah, nice to pick you up.

448
00:22:07,560 --> 00:22:12,200
The Lyft app says Donatello, so yeah.

449
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:13,400
Wait, you're almost ready.

450
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:15,160
Your ninja training is complete.

451
00:22:15,160 --> 00:22:18,760
First, my students, I have to hide your identity.

452
00:22:19,720 --> 00:22:23,160
Like, the jig is up at this point.

453
00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:24,560
The ship has sailed.

454
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:28,000
I had a Bigfoot encounter in high school.

455
00:22:32,520 --> 00:22:34,840
The problem is, now that I'm 30,

456
00:22:34,840 --> 00:22:36,520
I've noticed people start to get weird

457
00:22:36,520 --> 00:22:37,640
when I talk about it.

458
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:42,200
Even when they brought up Bigfoot

459
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:43,600
and how they believe in him.

460
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:46,840
This happens a lot at the office.

461
00:22:46,840 --> 00:22:47,680
Is there...

462
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:53,080
Is there any way not to sound crazy

463
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:55,440
when talking about my BFE?

464
00:22:57,640 --> 00:23:00,200
Or should I retire this story?

465
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:03,400
That's from encountered in East Lewis County.

466
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:06,120
Are you here?

467
00:23:06,120 --> 00:23:06,960
All right.

468
00:23:08,280 --> 00:23:09,560
Does the conversation...

469
00:23:09,560 --> 00:23:12,480
Is Bigfoot here?

470
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:14,720
I thought it was worth checking.

471
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:16,000
No, we're good.

472
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,320
Does the conversation go like this?

473
00:23:17,320 --> 00:23:18,920
Like, you overhear people talking at work,

474
00:23:18,920 --> 00:23:22,080
like, yeah, Bigfoot, I saw him crush five cars.

475
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:25,440
And you're like, yeah, I saw Bigfoot too.

476
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:27,640
I walked around with him and gave him some beef jerky

477
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:28,560
and he got real mad.

478
00:23:28,560 --> 00:23:29,400
Like, wait, hold on.

479
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:30,240
Wait, hold on, huh?

480
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:31,080
Hold on.

481
00:23:31,080 --> 00:23:32,160
You didn't mean the monster truck, did you?

482
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:33,480
Okay, I'm sorry.

483
00:23:36,120 --> 00:23:38,160
They, listen,

484
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:39,720
I hate to be the one to break this to you,

485
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:43,080
but they tricked you into telling your Bigfoot story.

486
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:47,080
They pretended to believe in Bigfoot

487
00:23:47,080 --> 00:23:48,720
so you would tell your Bigfoot story.

488
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:50,200
You got catfished.

489
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:52,440
You got Bigfushed.

490
00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:54,360
It happens.

491
00:23:54,360 --> 00:23:56,840
But they tricked you into telling your story,

492
00:23:56,840 --> 00:24:00,080
which I'm sorry, but that's what happened.

493
00:24:02,120 --> 00:24:04,480
Is it possible that when you started telling your story,

494
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:06,160
and you're like, yeah, I met him,

495
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:09,200
I met Bigfoot August 12th, 2001,

496
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:11,520
and they were like, no way.

497
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:15,280
I was with Bigfoot August 12th, 2001,

498
00:24:15,280 --> 00:24:17,000
and you were not there.

499
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:21,040
Is there more than one Bigfoot?

500
00:24:21,040 --> 00:24:22,320
Yeah.

501
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:24,160
All right, that's a consensus.

502
00:24:24,160 --> 00:24:25,800
Well, there's only one Bigfoot.

503
00:24:25,800 --> 00:24:27,720
There are many Sasquatches.

504
00:24:30,520 --> 00:24:34,560
There aren't.

505
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:37,120
And this, I think, is the heart of the problem.

506
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:38,200
I don't think,

507
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:42,200
I don't think, maybe,

508
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:44,280
it's not because you used to be a teen

509
00:24:44,280 --> 00:24:46,400
and it was adorable.

510
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:50,520
It's that when you were telling the story before,

511
00:24:50,520 --> 00:24:53,720
it was the aughts, and everything was fucking chill.

512
00:24:53,720 --> 00:24:55,760
And everybody was, yeah, man, Obama's president?

513
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:56,600
Maybe there's Bigfoots?

514
00:24:56,600 --> 00:24:58,160
I don't know, anyway.

515
00:24:58,160 --> 00:24:59,200
That's so funny.

516
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:00,040
That's kooky.

517
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:01,840
Now it's 2018, and somebody's like,

518
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:02,840
hey, there are Bigfoots.

519
00:25:02,840 --> 00:25:04,040
I feel like I have to be like,

520
00:25:04,040 --> 00:25:05,120
no, there aren't.

521
00:25:06,120 --> 00:25:07,240
There aren't Bigfoots.

522
00:25:07,240 --> 00:25:08,080
Stop it.

523
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:09,280
You're embarrassing yourself.

524
00:25:09,280 --> 00:25:10,120
Stop.

525
00:25:10,120 --> 00:25:11,760
Comfort breeds whimsy.

526
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:13,240
Comfort breeds whimsy.

527
00:25:13,240 --> 00:25:14,080
I can't hide it.

528
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:15,800
You can say, stop it.

529
00:25:15,800 --> 00:25:16,640
There aren't.

530
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:17,480
Move on.

531
00:25:17,480 --> 00:25:18,320
Next thing.

532
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:20,640
We're dealing with Bigfoot hook right now.

533
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:24,480
We're in, yes, 1990, early 2000,

534
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:26,240
we were young, Peter,

535
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:28,480
but now we've gone on to be a lawyer,

536
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:30,800
and we've forgotten what it is to believe.

537
00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:33,720
And now we can't accept there's a Bigfoot,

538
00:25:33,720 --> 00:25:36,200
because that means dreams come true.

539
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:38,800
And as we all know, they do not.

540
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:39,640
We need,

541
00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:42,440
we need Bigfoot.

542
00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:43,280
We need Bigfoot.

543
00:25:43,280 --> 00:25:44,960
Bigfoot to come kick in the door

544
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:46,600
of our British grandma's house.

545
00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:47,440
Yes.

546
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:49,600
Where we are staying with our wife and children,

547
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:51,960
and there's an estranged thing going on there,

548
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:55,160
and then the Bigfoot just beats the shit out of us.

549
00:25:55,160 --> 00:25:56,680
Uh-huh.

550
00:25:56,680 --> 00:25:59,160
It's been a while since I've seen Hook, but yes.

551
00:25:59,160 --> 00:26:00,560
He beats the shit out of us,

552
00:26:00,560 --> 00:26:02,040
and then he takes my glasses off,

553
00:26:02,040 --> 00:26:04,840
and he's like, there you are, Griffin.

554
00:26:04,840 --> 00:26:07,280
He squishes my face for like 10 minutes.

555
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:09,640
Yep.

556
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:16,440
You know how he does.

557
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:18,240
You remember how he does it.

558
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:22,200
You wanna do another Yahoo, or should I do a question?

559
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:23,160
I can do a Yahoo.

560
00:26:23,160 --> 00:26:24,360
This feels like a trap.

561
00:26:24,360 --> 00:26:25,280
Is it a trap?

562
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:27,240
No.

563
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:30,800
Okay.

564
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:34,600
This is a Yahoo that was sent in by Tim Hall.

565
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:35,760
Thank you, Tim.

566
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:38,000
Oh no.

567
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:43,000
It's Yahoo Answers user, Angela, who asks,

568
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:46,880
you can't, if I get to the subject of the Yahoo,

569
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:49,200
you're not allowed to jump in with one of your bits.

570
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:50,240
I wouldn't jump in with any bits.

571
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:51,080
Okay.

572
00:26:51,080 --> 00:26:55,280
Angela asks, why are human babies more foolish

573
00:26:55,280 --> 00:27:01,880
than most other animal babies?

574
00:27:01,880 --> 00:27:04,720
Other animal babies like kittens, pups, et cetera,

575
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:07,120
can survive even if they're orphaned or injured,

576
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:10,280
but human babies are sure to die if they get no help.

577
00:27:10,280 --> 00:27:13,880
Why is that so when humans are actually more intelligent,

578
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:26,400
parentheses, have the sixth sense than other animals?

579
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:27,840
But, hold on.

580
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:33,200
My baby does have a bit of the telekinesis.

581
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:35,640
A baby wolf is still going at him up.

582
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:39,960
This baby, yes, that baby, the baby wolf.

583
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:40,880
Not even a contact.

584
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:44,600
Be it a fight or a court case, the baby will always lose.

585
00:27:44,600 --> 00:27:46,520
Baby wolf ate my psychic baby.

586
00:27:46,520 --> 00:27:47,360
Yep.

587
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:53,160
How come my human baby is so weak

588
00:27:53,160 --> 00:27:55,240
compared to the powerful horse baby?

589
00:27:56,880 --> 00:27:59,320
Giraffe, land on feet, walk, walk, walk.

590
00:27:59,320 --> 00:28:00,320
Yeah.

591
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:02,200
Baby, take like two years.

592
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:04,040
Takes like a long, long, long time.

593
00:28:04,040 --> 00:28:07,000
I will also say I like that they use the word foolish

594
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:09,640
in the subject line, which I don't feel

595
00:28:09,640 --> 00:28:11,000
that's what they're going for.

596
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:11,840
Not accurate.

597
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:13,240
Ah, you know how babies are so foolish

598
00:28:13,240 --> 00:28:14,480
and could be eaten by a wolf?

599
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:16,920
Yeah, babies are always wild and out.

600
00:28:16,920 --> 00:28:17,760
Well, listen.

601
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:20,520
You know those trickster babies

602
00:28:20,520 --> 00:28:21,360
who can't bend for themselves?

603
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:23,280
You know trickster babies always getting silly?

604
00:28:23,280 --> 00:28:27,120
Do you guys remember when the baby hippo, Fiona, was born?

605
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:28,680
Yes.

606
00:28:28,680 --> 00:28:30,480
I remember it vividly, sir.

607
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:32,440
And we all thought as a nation

608
00:28:32,440 --> 00:28:38,840
that thing could really kick my baby's ass.

609
00:28:38,840 --> 00:28:43,440
If there were 10 human babies versus one baby hippo, Fiona,

610
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:46,280
a hundred, how many would it take?

611
00:28:47,280 --> 00:28:49,280
One brave baby.

612
00:28:50,680 --> 00:28:54,440
That's why I've been training BB accordingly.

613
00:28:54,440 --> 00:28:57,040
Every day I show her a picture of Fiona and go,

614
00:28:57,040 --> 00:28:58,360
not today.

615
00:28:58,360 --> 00:29:02,840
You don't know that the animal would eat the baby.

616
00:29:02,840 --> 00:29:06,320
Like, I think that all animals would,

617
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:07,440
if I've learned anything from books

618
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:09,200
is that the animal would raise the baby.

619
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:10,040
Yes.

620
00:29:10,040 --> 00:29:11,280
A hundred percent of the time.

621
00:29:11,280 --> 00:29:15,280
A hundred percent of the time wild animal finds free baby.

622
00:29:15,280 --> 00:29:17,600
It says sick free baby.

623
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:19,960
Oh, well, I'm not going to waste this, they say.

624
00:29:19,960 --> 00:29:22,520
Eventually he'll be able to explain to other humans

625
00:29:22,520 --> 00:29:25,880
to like not take, like not colonize my land

626
00:29:25,880 --> 00:29:27,200
or whatever it is animals do.

627
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:31,160
And like Tarzan books or happy feet, happy feet,

628
00:29:31,160 --> 00:29:33,320
whatever you want to raise the baby.

629
00:29:33,320 --> 00:29:35,040
One exception, if I can jump in.

630
00:29:35,040 --> 00:29:35,880
Yeah.

631
00:29:35,880 --> 00:29:37,120
Do you remember the good joke?

632
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:39,200
That's like, I didn't go like my baby.

633
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:40,040
Do you remember him?

634
00:29:40,040 --> 00:29:43,480
Yeah, yeah, that was a, that was a scam

635
00:29:43,480 --> 00:29:50,480
because the dingo raised the baby to adulthood,

636
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:54,080
but then was embarrassed that he hadn't brought the baby back.

637
00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:58,320
He realized, he realized that he should have.

638
00:29:58,320 --> 00:30:01,560
And then later Meryl Streep was like at Starbucks

639
00:30:01,560 --> 00:30:02,520
and then Bruce is like,

640
00:30:02,520 --> 00:30:03,760
anyway, do you want to drink?

641
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:05,000
Woof, woof, woof.

642
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:08,160
She was like, you look like exactly like my baby's son.

643
00:30:08,160 --> 00:30:11,000
And the guy was like, no, I was raised by dingoes actually.

644
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:13,160
It's like, it's pretty chill.

645
00:30:13,160 --> 00:30:15,120
So what you're saying is there's a circumstance

646
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:16,920
in which someone came to where the baby had been

647
00:30:16,920 --> 00:30:18,680
and there were dingoes there and they're like,

648
00:30:18,680 --> 00:30:19,520
have you seen a baby?

649
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:22,840
And they're like, no, dingo ate your baby.

650
00:30:22,840 --> 00:30:24,200
Dingo ate your baby.

651
00:30:24,200 --> 00:30:26,360
Yeah, one of the dingoes ate the baby.

652
00:30:26,360 --> 00:30:28,640
And then the baby dingo's like, indeed.

653
00:30:29,920 --> 00:30:31,000
Yeah, they totally did.

654
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:32,720
They did, check out my whiskers, anyway.

655
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:35,320
Wait, how old is this baby?

656
00:30:35,320 --> 00:30:36,600
He's 17 years old.

657
00:30:37,800 --> 00:30:38,880
Always be my baby.

658
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:41,000
Yeah, dingo ate your baby or whatever.

659
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:43,760
They let me watch MTV, so.

660
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:48,760
Yeah, I get to have, dingo mom lets me have fruit rollups,

661
00:30:49,240 --> 00:30:51,240
basically whatever I want.

662
00:30:51,240 --> 00:30:52,920
So I'm just gonna stay with dingo mom.

663
00:30:52,920 --> 00:30:56,320
I haven't had to go to driver's ed in a while now, so.

664
00:30:56,320 --> 00:30:59,360
I did not think that dumb dingo ate your baby reference

665
00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:01,520
was gonna give us so much material.

666
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:04,360
One could argue it didn't.

667
00:31:04,360 --> 00:31:05,200
Sure.

668
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:10,280
So, Griffin, do you have any more yahoos?

669
00:31:13,320 --> 00:31:15,320
Let him have this.

670
00:31:15,320 --> 00:31:16,680
Start another yahoo, bro.

671
00:31:16,680 --> 00:31:21,680
Say anything.

672
00:31:26,760 --> 00:31:30,720
I've got a yahoo here that was sent in by.

673
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:32,760
Say what's in your mind.

674
00:31:32,760 --> 00:31:34,920
Say what's in your mind.

675
00:31:34,920 --> 00:31:36,840
Say what's in your mind.

676
00:31:36,840 --> 00:31:38,520
Say what's in your mind.

677
00:31:38,520 --> 00:31:46,520
so

678
00:31:46,520 --> 00:31:48,520
No, stop, you'll fuck me up.

679
00:31:48,520 --> 00:31:49,520
On the back beat.

680
00:31:49,520 --> 00:32:01,520
I want a munch!

681
00:32:01,520 --> 00:32:04,520
I want a munch!

682
00:32:04,520 --> 00:32:10,520
I want two munches!

683
00:32:10,520 --> 00:32:11,520
This is Munch Squad.

684
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:15,520
It's a podcast within a podcast.

685
00:32:15,520 --> 00:32:22,520
About the latest and greatest in fast food inventions.

686
00:32:22,520 --> 00:32:27,520
You guys know Dunkin' Donuts?

687
00:32:27,520 --> 00:32:30,520
No more.

688
00:32:30,520 --> 00:32:33,520
Sorry, they're closing all the Dunkin' Donuts.

689
00:32:33,520 --> 00:32:34,520
No, just kidding.

690
00:32:34,520 --> 00:32:35,520
Are you for real?

691
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:38,520
Nah, bud.

692
00:32:38,520 --> 00:32:44,520
They're changing the name of it.

693
00:32:44,520 --> 00:32:48,520
And this is not when IHOP was like, we're IHOP.

694
00:32:48,520 --> 00:32:50,520
And everybody was like, fuck off.

695
00:32:50,520 --> 00:32:53,520
Can we brief the version?

696
00:32:53,520 --> 00:32:54,520
That was real, right?

697
00:32:54,520 --> 00:32:57,520
And everybody was like, hey, that's really bad.

698
00:32:57,520 --> 00:33:00,520
And they were like, yeah, can you imagine?

699
00:33:00,520 --> 00:33:03,520
J.J. Simmons, no.

700
00:33:03,520 --> 00:33:06,520
Can I also just say, I also like the way that you started it.

701
00:33:06,520 --> 00:33:09,520
Because it made me think, what if there was a fast food agent who was like, you know what?

702
00:33:09,520 --> 00:33:10,520
We're done.

703
00:33:10,520 --> 00:33:11,520
Oh, are you going bankrupt?

704
00:33:11,520 --> 00:33:12,520
No, we're doing great.

705
00:33:12,520 --> 00:33:13,520
But you know what?

706
00:33:13,520 --> 00:33:14,520
You deserve us.

707
00:33:14,520 --> 00:33:17,520
I was going to say, we've done everything we could think of.

708
00:33:17,520 --> 00:33:20,520
We can't think of any other weird donuts.

709
00:33:20,520 --> 00:33:27,520
Nah, this is Dunkin' Donuts is no more.

710
00:33:27,520 --> 00:33:29,520
Welcome to the stage.

711
00:33:29,520 --> 00:33:33,520
Not to this stage, sort of the world stage.

712
00:33:33,520 --> 00:33:42,520
Dunkin'.

713
00:33:42,520 --> 00:33:46,520
All brands are so bad.

714
00:33:46,520 --> 00:33:50,520
Do y'all have Dunkin' here?

715
00:33:50,520 --> 00:33:52,520
See, you don't have a fucking horse in this race.

716
00:33:52,520 --> 00:33:54,520
You don't give a shit.

717
00:33:54,520 --> 00:34:00,520
Man, I wish I had a tiny piece of paper that I could just write down what I think their explanation for the thing is,

718
00:34:00,520 --> 00:34:05,520
feel it in an envelope, and then open it back up when you're done reading it.

719
00:34:05,520 --> 00:34:07,520
Okay, so America Runs on Dunkin'.

720
00:34:07,520 --> 00:34:09,520
That's the tagline.

721
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:16,520
And with customers around the world naturally and affectionately referring to the brand as Dunkin',

722
00:34:16,520 --> 00:34:22,520
in recognition of this relationship as one of the many steps to transform itself into the premier beverage-led,

723
00:34:22,520 --> 00:34:29,520
on-the-go brand, the company today unveiled its new branding at its global franchisee convention.

724
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:33,520
I bet that's a fucking party.

725
00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:39,520
That officially recognizes its name as simply Dunkin'.

726
00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:45,520
So, when it says beverage-led, is that bullshit?

727
00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:49,520
The cups just say D-N-K-N on them now.

728
00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:50,520
Oh my god.

729
00:34:50,520 --> 00:34:53,520
It's like a fucking social network.

730
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:59,520
In case the coffee is so delicious that you want to buy their stocks.

731
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:03,520
Somebody probably does buy the stock of Dunkin' Donuts.

732
00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:09,520
The brand tested the new logo extensively, including on exterior signage at Dunkin' locations,

733
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:13,520
featuring this next-generation design concept over the past year.

734
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:14,520
So let's check in with...

735
00:35:14,520 --> 00:35:17,520
I've never heard you so defeated by a munch squad before.

736
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:24,520
Let's chuck in with Dunkin' brand CEO and Dunkin' U.S. President David Hoffman.

737
00:35:24,520 --> 00:35:30,520
Hi, I'm David Hoffman, and I'm the president of Dunkin'.

738
00:35:30,520 --> 00:35:32,520
Damn, that is a good title, though.

739
00:35:32,520 --> 00:35:36,520
I bet this was his call, right?

740
00:35:36,520 --> 00:35:38,520
I'm so good on the court.

741
00:35:38,520 --> 00:35:43,520
Yeah, I want to be officially recognized as the president of Dunkin'.

742
00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:46,520
Not Dunking, Dunkin'.

743
00:35:46,520 --> 00:35:53,520
Our new branding is one of the many things we're doing as part of our blueprint for growth to modernize.

744
00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:54,520
You shrank it.

745
00:35:54,520 --> 00:35:57,520
You shrank the name.

746
00:35:57,520 --> 00:36:01,520
To modernize the Dunkin' experience for our customers.

747
00:36:01,520 --> 00:36:06,520
From our next-generation restaurants to our menu innovation, on-the-go ordering, and value offerings,

748
00:36:06,520 --> 00:36:10,520
all delivered at the speed of Dunkin'.

749
00:36:10,520 --> 00:36:12,520
I don't know what that means.

750
00:36:12,520 --> 00:36:20,520
We believe our efforts to transform Dunkin' while still embracing our incredible heritage.

751
00:36:20,520 --> 00:36:30,520
What do you think that means?

752
00:36:30,520 --> 00:36:33,520
When they discovered the Dead Sea Doughnuts.

753
00:36:33,520 --> 00:36:35,520
Remember our proud heritage?

754
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:39,520
A selling dough to people after we fried it?

755
00:36:39,520 --> 00:36:47,520
Do you remember when we found that Dunkin' Doughnuts in a gas station last January and it was still called Dunkin' Doughnuts?

756
00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:52,520
What a proud heritage that was.

757
00:36:52,520 --> 00:36:56,520
Do you think the CEO of the yo-yo company does this reading and is going,

758
00:36:56,520 --> 00:36:58,520
wait, hold on.

759
00:36:58,520 --> 00:36:59,520
Hey, hold on.

760
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:00,520
Aren't we still Dunkin'?

761
00:37:00,520 --> 00:37:01,520
Aren't we Dunkin'?

762
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:02,520
We're Dunkin'.

763
00:37:02,520 --> 00:37:03,520
Are we Dunkin'?

764
00:37:03,520 --> 00:37:05,520
Fuck.

765
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:08,520
So they've, oh my God, the story.

766
00:37:08,520 --> 00:37:12,520
They are doing so much apologizing for this.

767
00:37:12,520 --> 00:37:14,520
Like they know how bad it is.

768
00:37:14,520 --> 00:37:18,520
There's literally a segment on here of this like very long story.

769
00:37:18,520 --> 00:37:20,520
Probably the longest I've ever seen on QSR.

770
00:37:20,520 --> 00:37:22,520
Dunkin' to remain sweet.

771
00:37:22,520 --> 00:37:24,520
It's a quick service question for the publication.

772
00:37:24,520 --> 00:37:25,520
Sure, sure, sure.

773
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:29,520
Dunkin' to remain sweet on doughnuts.

774
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:33,520
Although the word doughnuts will no longer appear in the logo or branding,

775
00:37:33,520 --> 00:37:39,520
doughnuts will remain a significant focus of the brand as the number one retailer of doughnuts in America,

776
00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:45,520
selling more than 2.9 billion doughnuts along with local favorites.

777
00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:49,520
So guests know they'll be able to find the top selling doughnuts and fun seasonal varieties

778
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:52,520
no matter which Dunkin' location they visit.

779
00:37:52,520 --> 00:37:59,520
So here's what I, I see what they're going with sort of where they want to sell other things.

780
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:04,520
So they want to change the name and they want to expand the brand.

781
00:38:04,520 --> 00:38:10,520
I think it's weird that they're like what's the best way to sum up what we do?

782
00:38:10,520 --> 00:38:20,520
It's kind of like the number one thing more so than doughnuts is we want to keep the pride tradition

783
00:38:20,520 --> 00:38:24,520
of taking one thing and putting it in a liquid.

784
00:38:24,520 --> 00:38:29,520
The one thing that we want people to know that they're going to come in here and do is take a solid thing

785
00:38:29,520 --> 00:38:35,520
and put it in a wet thing and then consume the result of that action.

786
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:39,520
That is still a big part of our heritage and our brand.

787
00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:44,520
Sure. Also Dunkin' and that still sucks to say it like that.

788
00:38:44,520 --> 00:38:49,520
And the fact that I have to do it for the rest of my life bores me out in a huge way.

789
00:38:49,520 --> 00:38:55,520
You can't say but we still love doughnuts though when you've just struck doughnuts from your name.

790
00:38:55,520 --> 00:39:00,520
When you've like erased the fact that you ever made doughnuts in your entire life.

791
00:39:00,520 --> 00:39:06,520
If the old spaghetti factory was like we're just the old factory now but our spaghetti is still dope.

792
00:39:06,520 --> 00:39:07,520
But we still love spaghetti.

793
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:10,520
We're crazy about this stuff.

794
00:39:10,520 --> 00:39:18,520
I just like this idea of like somewhere like the CEO who was like well we're number one in doughnuts so we beat that.

795
00:39:18,520 --> 00:39:19,520
We beat that.

796
00:39:19,520 --> 00:39:37,520
Now what we haven't beaten is the moistening of dry things.

797
00:39:37,520 --> 00:39:39,520
Oh you cards.

798
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:41,520
Boy howdy that was a lot of fun.

799
00:39:41,520 --> 00:39:47,520
Hey baby I hear the blues a calling toss salads and scrambled eggs.

800
00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:54,520
We didn't do hey we didn't do that at all during the show and I just edited it and I felt like such a piece of shit.

801
00:39:54,520 --> 00:40:01,520
Because I didn't we didn't do and everybody needs that joke at a Seattle live show and we didn't fucking give it to them.

802
00:40:01,520 --> 00:40:07,520
And so they all left you know with blue balls.

803
00:40:07,520 --> 00:40:08,520
Quite stylish.

804
00:40:08,520 --> 00:40:09,520
Quite stylish.

805
00:40:09,520 --> 00:40:11,520
So our first sponsor is Casper.

806
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:12,520
Casper is wonderful.

807
00:40:12,520 --> 00:40:14,520
They make quality mattresses.

808
00:40:14,520 --> 00:40:18,520
Hey baby I hear the sleep a calling salad and scrambled sheets.

809
00:40:18,520 --> 00:40:25,520
Yeah there is a sleep brand that continues to revolutionize its line of products to create an exceptionally comfortable sleep experience one night at a time.

810
00:40:25,520 --> 00:40:27,520
They are really great mattresses.

811
00:40:27,520 --> 00:40:30,520
We have one on our guest room that I've slept on a couple of times.

812
00:40:30,520 --> 00:40:36,520
Every time we have guests in town they they sleep over and we always get just rave reviews.

813
00:40:36,520 --> 00:40:42,520
Their mattresses combine multiple supportive memory phones for a quality sleep surface with the right amount of sink and the right amount of bounce.

819
00:41:00,520 --> 00:41:05,520
Hey baby I hear the booze a calling toss bottles and scrambled grapes.

820
00:41:05,520 --> 00:41:12,520
Okay wine is basically scrambled grapes.

821
00:41:12,520 --> 00:41:14,520
Oh Griffin you done gave it away.

822
00:41:14,520 --> 00:41:15,520
It's wine folks.

823
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:19,520
This is a wine one that we're talking about Wink.

You tell Wink what you like and the kind of flavors you enjoy.

You don't have to pick out varieties of wine or specific orchards.

826
00:41:30,520 --> 00:41:39,520
Wink will just take your choices your flavor preferences and they're going to create a great box of wine.

827
00:41:39,520 --> 00:41:47,520
Not box wine but a box of wines just for you.

This one's for Shane from Caitlin who says to Shane happiest of birthdays to the love of my life and the sunshine of my every day.

842
00:42:46,520 --> 00:42:50,520
I can't wait for all the things 24 will hold for you.

843
00:42:50,520 --> 00:42:52,520
Ah man I heard the new season's going to be so tight.

844
00:42:52,520 --> 00:42:56,520
Jack's back and this time he's got three guns.

845
00:42:56,520 --> 00:43:01,520
Here's to the first of a lifetime of birthdays together because you're the plan.

846
00:43:01,520 --> 00:43:06,520
I love you, your cute face and your cute butt.

847
00:43:06,520 --> 00:43:07,520
That is all. Namaste.

848
00:43:07,520 --> 00:43:10,520
P.S. We're dogs now and I can't stress that enough.

849
00:43:10,520 --> 00:43:11,520
Bow wow for now.

850
00:43:11,520 --> 00:43:17,520
I don't even want to say when they wanted this birthday message but we fucked up.

851
00:43:17,520 --> 00:43:21,520
Don't focus on that. Focus on the really good 24 bit that was in there.

852
00:43:21,520 --> 00:43:25,520
That's what people are going to leave.

853
00:43:25,520 --> 00:43:28,520
Jack's back baby.

854
00:43:28,520 --> 00:43:30,520
Jack's back baby on this one.

855
00:43:30,520 --> 00:43:35,520
I got a message for Lovebug and it's from Sweet and it says hey Lovebug it's Sweet.

856
00:43:35,520 --> 00:43:37,520
I wanted to say that I love you.

857
00:43:37,520 --> 00:43:40,520
You're so dang cute and I can't wait to see you again.

858
00:43:40,520 --> 00:43:45,520
I hope this sweet message read by some of our favorite brothers brings a smile to your face.

859
00:43:45,520 --> 00:44:00,520
That is very cute and beautiful but I am now obsessed with the idea that across the nation hundreds, perhaps thousands of lovers just looked at their partner and said oh yeah that was me.

860
00:44:00,520 --> 00:44:02,520
That was me for you for sure.

861
00:44:02,520 --> 00:44:04,520
That is for you.

862
00:44:04,520 --> 00:44:12,520
I also love how it says some of our favorite brothers reflecting the fact Travis is not here because of the parachute accident.

863
00:44:12,520 --> 00:44:17,520
I miss Travis so much and folks please don't try to eat an entire parachute.

864
00:44:17,520 --> 00:44:19,520
It's bad for you.

865
00:44:19,520 --> 00:44:21,520
It's bad for your body, your human body.

866
00:44:21,520 --> 00:44:24,520
I can't wait to get back to this fucking show.

867
00:44:24,520 --> 00:44:25,520
Yeah for sure.

868
00:44:25,520 --> 00:44:28,520
Before that though thank you to everybody who came out to our shows in the Pacific Northwest.

869
00:44:28,520 --> 00:44:29,520
It was super super fun.

870
00:44:29,520 --> 00:44:32,520
We had a really really good time on tour this time.

871
00:44:32,520 --> 00:44:35,520
Hey baby I hear the fans are calling.

872
00:44:35,520 --> 00:44:38,520
Toss tickets and let me try again.

873
00:44:38,520 --> 00:44:39,520
Oh yeah.

874
00:44:39,520 --> 00:44:48,520
Hey baby I hear the fans are calling. Toss tickets and scrambled bits because we do different bits.

875
00:44:48,520 --> 00:44:50,520
Yeah we do.

876
00:44:53,520 --> 00:44:57,520
I'm bailiff Jesse Thorn and justice is within your reach.

877
00:44:57,520 --> 00:45:00,520
My mom refuses to take my phone calls.

878
00:45:00,520 --> 00:45:04,520
My boyfriend says I should take our cats with me to graduate school but I think he should keep them.

879
00:45:04,520 --> 00:45:08,520
In the court of Judge John Hodgman, justice rules.

880
00:45:08,520 --> 00:45:12,520
My partner's board game collection is out of control.

881
00:45:12,520 --> 00:45:15,520
My sister won't stop stealing my clothes.

882
00:45:15,520 --> 00:45:18,520
I'm Judge John Hodgman. I'm tough but fair.

883
00:45:18,520 --> 00:45:19,520
Tough but fair.

884
00:45:19,520 --> 00:45:22,520
I'll bring you justice and I'm only a click away.

885
00:45:22,520 --> 00:45:23,520
Tipping.

886
00:45:23,520 --> 00:45:24,520
Automotive etiquette.

887
00:45:24,520 --> 00:45:25,520
Siblings.

888
00:45:25,520 --> 00:45:26,520
Roommates.

889
00:45:26,520 --> 00:45:31,520
If you've got a case go to Maximumfun.org slash JJHO.

890
00:45:31,520 --> 00:45:34,520

891
00:45:34,520 --> 00:45:35,520
Tough but fair.

893
00:45:37,520 --> 00:45:39,520
Judge John Hodgman rules.

894
00:45:39,520 --> 00:45:41,520
That is all.

895
00:45:41,520 --> 00:45:49,520
I want to do a Yahoo sent in by everyone and it's not like, seriously I got this from like 30 different people.

896
00:45:49,520 --> 00:45:59,520
I don't know that it's going to be the richest like conversation vein for me but it has 82 answers which is by far the most I've ever seen on a Yahoo before.

897
00:45:59,520 --> 00:46:02,520
I want to explore some of them. Thank you for sending this in.

898
00:46:02,520 --> 00:46:05,520
It's an anonymous Yahoo user.

899
00:46:05,520 --> 00:46:08,520
I'm going to call them.

900
00:46:08,520 --> 00:46:13,520
Duncan asks.

901
00:46:13,520 --> 00:46:21,520
Duncan asks, how are you able to be on Yahoo every morning and not work for a living?

902
00:46:21,520 --> 00:46:28,520
Now, that is of course, that's an email that Griffin gets daily.

903
00:46:28,520 --> 00:46:35,520
It took me a bit to decipher this question whether it was saying, this website is so delectable.

904
00:46:35,520 --> 00:46:39,520
I sit down at my desk at work booted up on my computer.

905
00:46:39,520 --> 00:46:41,520
Oh no, it's five o'clock.

906
00:46:41,520 --> 00:46:47,520
I've been on Yahoo all day looking at all of my great friends telling great answers to each other.

907
00:46:47,520 --> 00:46:52,520
But the other side of this is like, how can you be on Yahoo and not be inspired to have a job?

908
00:46:52,520 --> 00:46:59,520
I think or how do you all have time must be because you're unemployed. Any of them are bad.

909
00:46:59,520 --> 00:47:02,520
Let's start digging in.

910
00:47:02,520 --> 00:47:12,520
An anonymous Yahoo user top answer says, because poking fun at this shit show of a liberal circle jerk is my job.

911
00:47:12,520 --> 00:47:20,520
I'm Damien Yahoo.

912
00:47:20,520 --> 00:47:34,520
Jake McClake says, not every morning, but many I'm on sick leave because of an operation and blood clots.

913
00:47:34,520 --> 00:47:49,520
Retired old Sarge says, because I was military for almost 33 years and I was smart enough to start my own business and hire people who I can trust to be there and take care of it for me.

914
00:47:49,520 --> 00:47:51,520
What?

915
00:47:51,520 --> 00:47:58,520
I built a successful small business where I could hire trustworthy people so I could be on this fucking tasty website.

916
00:47:58,520 --> 00:48:04,520
Back in 1970, I started my own business because I knew one day I'd want to be on Yahoo all the time.

917
00:48:04,520 --> 00:48:07,520
Can we go back to the person who said this is their job?

918
00:48:07,520 --> 00:48:10,520
Because how far does that get you?

919
00:48:10,520 --> 00:48:18,520
That was Griffin.

920
00:48:18,520 --> 00:48:23,520
Yahoo answers B says, okay, Yahoo police.

921
00:48:23,520 --> 00:48:25,520
This person is your boss.

922
00:48:25,520 --> 00:48:27,520
This person is not trying to nark on you.

923
00:48:27,520 --> 00:48:29,520
They're just making conversation.

924
00:48:29,520 --> 00:48:32,520
Yahoo answers user E says, it's not the morning everywhere.

925
00:48:32,520 --> 00:48:34,520
Time zones, bruh.

926
00:48:34,520 --> 00:48:37,520
What?

927
00:48:37,520 --> 00:48:41,520
I only get on this website at 3 p.m.

928
00:48:41,520 --> 00:48:48,520
Jeffrey says, I'm happily retired and there's Jeffrey's picture so like you know he's legit.

929
00:48:48,520 --> 00:48:51,520
Y'all can't enjoy that but it's good.

930
00:48:51,520 --> 00:48:53,520
A lot of people are retired.

931
00:48:53,520 --> 00:49:02,520
I broke a few bones, got shot a few times, just a few bad days at my office and I do it again.

932
00:49:02,520 --> 00:49:11,520
I love this one too because there are people who don't understand like you can post something and then see it hours later.

933
00:49:11,520 --> 00:49:14,520
Someone responded, news flash, it's the afternoon.

934
00:49:14,520 --> 00:49:21,520
EIEIO says, I am largely retired except for some board of directors work in investment management.

935
00:49:21,520 --> 00:49:23,520
No, it's not true.

936
00:49:23,520 --> 00:49:29,520
What that was was a lie you said.

937
00:49:29,520 --> 00:49:33,520
Lots of people on here still work.

938
00:49:33,520 --> 00:49:38,520
Justin time says, I run heavy equipment, go to work at 7 a.m.

939
00:49:38,520 --> 00:49:43,520
Yeah, that's what they said.

940
00:49:43,520 --> 00:49:47,520
I don't even comprehend this question.

941
00:49:47,520 --> 00:49:49,520
All right, we're running short on time.

942
00:49:49,520 --> 00:49:51,520
We should do the audience questions.

943
00:49:51,520 --> 00:49:55,520
The way we do this now, please don't move a muscle.

944
00:49:55,520 --> 00:49:59,520
There are asps everywhere.

945
00:49:59,520 --> 00:50:03,520
Under each of your seat is one discrete asp.

946
00:50:03,520 --> 00:50:06,520
Some of them lazier than others.

947
00:50:06,520 --> 00:50:09,520
We have some submissions that people sent in.

948
00:50:09,520 --> 00:50:12,520
We got some one sentence briefings.

949
00:50:12,520 --> 00:50:16,520
We're going to call out names and seat numbers and you're going to come up to these microphones.

950
00:50:16,520 --> 00:50:18,520
Can we get house lights turned up, please?

951
00:50:18,520 --> 00:50:20,520
I don't know who I'm looking at.

952
00:50:20,520 --> 00:50:21,520
Paul, please.

953
00:50:21,520 --> 00:50:24,520
Can we turn boy lights down a little bit?

954
00:50:24,520 --> 00:50:26,520
Hey, what's up?

955
00:50:26,520 --> 00:50:27,520
Over there.

956
00:50:27,520 --> 00:50:28,520
Hey, what's your name?

957
00:50:28,520 --> 00:50:29,520
Sam.

958
00:50:29,520 --> 00:50:30,520
Hi, Sam.

959
00:50:30,520 --> 00:50:31,520
I use they, them pronouns.

960
00:50:31,520 --> 00:50:32,520
Thank you so much.

961
00:50:32,520 --> 00:50:33,520
Hello, Sam.

962
00:50:33,520 --> 00:50:44,520
And my question is, well, so on the way here to get to my car, I walked through a giant spider web.

963
00:50:44,520 --> 00:50:46,520
Not for the first time.

964
00:50:46,520 --> 00:50:47,520
Were you home right now?

965
00:50:47,520 --> 00:50:52,520
I was trying to do a fucking no doubt joke, but it didn't come to me in time and I apologize.

966
00:50:52,520 --> 00:50:56,520
Can we get the audience mic turned up a little bit so we can hear Sam better?

967
00:50:56,520 --> 00:50:57,520
Thank you.

968
00:50:57,520 --> 00:50:58,520
Sorry.

969
00:50:58,520 --> 00:50:59,520
Oh, no.

970
00:50:59,520 --> 00:51:05,520
So to get into my car, my car is often like surrounded by spider webs and usually I'm pretty good.

971
00:51:05,520 --> 00:51:07,520
But sometimes.

972
00:51:07,520 --> 00:51:09,520
Can I break down that sentence?

973
00:51:09,520 --> 00:51:11,520
Hold on, Sam.

974
00:51:11,520 --> 00:51:14,520
What are you good at?

975
00:51:14,520 --> 00:51:16,520
Are you in the forbidden forest?

976
00:51:16,520 --> 00:51:20,520
Is there like an incommiserate amount of spider webs compared with like other cars near your car?

977
00:51:20,520 --> 00:51:25,520
Or do you just only work one day every thousand years?

978
00:51:25,520 --> 00:51:30,520
Anyway, I disappear like Brigadoon.

979
00:51:30,520 --> 00:51:37,520
No, it's like it's like a parking spot and an assigned spot and like there's like a pole next to it says fighters will like just.

980
00:51:37,520 --> 00:51:39,520
They'll strip on it.

981
00:51:39,520 --> 00:51:41,520
Is it a sign?

982
00:51:41,520 --> 00:51:42,520
It's gross.

983
00:51:42,520 --> 00:51:44,520
Is it an assigned parking?

984
00:51:44,520 --> 00:51:45,520
Yes, I cannot escape.

985
00:51:45,520 --> 00:51:47,520
I've tried.

986
00:51:47,520 --> 00:51:55,520
No, so today to get here after work, I went to my car and walked right into the biggest one I've ever seen.

987
00:51:55,520 --> 00:52:00,520
And people started laughing because apparently a family had been like watching from their apartment.

988
00:52:00,520 --> 00:52:05,520
And I heard one of them say, she walked right into it.

989
00:52:05,520 --> 00:52:06,520
Wow.

990
00:52:06,520 --> 00:52:16,520
So I'm just wondering, like, can I pull it off somehow or is there something I can do to mitigate everything about that?

991
00:52:16,520 --> 00:52:20,520
Maybe it's like, yeah, like cotton candy.

992
00:52:20,520 --> 00:52:23,520
That's where my mind immediately went.

993
00:52:23,520 --> 00:52:24,520
To eating it?

994
00:52:24,520 --> 00:52:26,520
To eating the web?

995
00:52:26,520 --> 00:52:30,520
To make it look like this is where I left my cotton candy yesterday and I'm just picking it up.

996
00:52:30,520 --> 00:52:32,520
That's good.

997
00:52:32,520 --> 00:52:44,520
No matter what move you do to like, like to react to the web, if you come up snapping, it's going to look very like you were starting a dance in a bad way.

998
00:52:44,520 --> 00:52:47,520
But then you're like, back with it, you know?

999
00:52:47,520 --> 00:52:51,520
Maybe as you run into the spider web, you just loudly announce, I'm helping him move.

1000
00:52:51,520 --> 00:52:52,520
Yeah.

1001
00:52:52,520 --> 00:52:53,520
Come with me.

1002
00:52:53,520 --> 00:52:58,520
What I did is I backed up and I looked at the spider and I said, oh, sorry.

1003
00:52:58,520 --> 00:52:59,520
That's great.

1004
00:52:59,520 --> 00:53:00,520
That was really nice.

1005
00:53:00,520 --> 00:53:02,520
Right.

1006
00:53:02,520 --> 00:53:06,520
Do you have an ongoing relationship with this spider?

1007
00:53:06,520 --> 00:53:07,520
It's hard to say.

1008
00:53:07,520 --> 00:53:08,520
They all look alike.

1009
00:53:08,520 --> 00:53:09,520
Do they?

1010
00:53:09,520 --> 00:53:10,520
Whoa.

1011
00:53:10,520 --> 00:53:11,520
Whoa, hey.

1012
00:53:11,520 --> 00:53:12,520
Whoa, Sam.

1013
00:53:12,520 --> 00:53:14,520
Whoa.

1014
00:53:14,520 --> 00:53:22,520
Does the spider ever leave messages like, some Jetta.

1015
00:53:22,520 --> 00:53:24,520
Stupid.

1016
00:53:24,520 --> 00:53:36,520
You could start carrying devil sticks with you to your car and then before you get in, just give it a quick like, and that'll usually clear it out and you look super fucking cool doing it.

1017
00:53:36,520 --> 00:53:37,520
So cool.

1018
00:53:37,520 --> 00:53:40,520
So cool.

1019
00:53:40,520 --> 00:53:43,520
That's like nine really good suggestions.

1020
00:53:43,520 --> 00:53:44,520
Does that help?

1021
00:53:44,520 --> 00:53:45,520
Does that help?

1022
00:53:45,520 --> 00:53:46,520
Thank you so much, Sam.

1023
00:53:46,520 --> 00:53:50,520
Thank you.

1024
00:53:50,520 --> 00:53:51,520
Hi, I'm Jessica.

1025
00:53:51,520 --> 00:53:52,520
Hi, Jessica.

1026
00:53:52,520 --> 00:53:53,520
Hi, Jessica.

1027
00:53:53,520 --> 00:53:54,520
This is my question.

1028
00:53:54,520 --> 00:53:55,520
Sure.

1029
00:53:55,520 --> 00:53:59,520
Oh, I like that gentle lead in.

1030
00:53:59,520 --> 00:54:01,520
In case you didn't know.

1031
00:54:01,520 --> 00:54:06,520
So I know that some or all of you have had GI issues and my questions relate to that.

1032
00:54:06,520 --> 00:54:11,520
Me.

1033
00:54:11,520 --> 00:54:15,520
So my husband seems to be developing a problem with dairy.

1034
00:54:15,520 --> 00:54:18,520
He loves pizza.

1035
00:54:18,520 --> 00:54:20,520
And it destroys him.

1036
00:54:20,520 --> 00:54:21,520
Sure.

1037
00:54:21,520 --> 00:54:35,520
We have a two year old, and when I come home with a two year old and I say go find daddy, the first place she looks is the bathroom.

1038
00:54:35,520 --> 00:54:40,520
Kids do the most hurtful things.

1039
00:54:40,520 --> 00:54:44,520
Kids do the truest things.

1040
00:54:44,520 --> 00:54:48,520
To avoid any possible future embarrassments.

1041
00:54:48,520 --> 00:54:55,520
What can I do to pizza to make my husband pizza lover never want it again?

1042
00:54:55,520 --> 00:54:59,520
Oh,

1043
00:54:59,520 --> 00:55:00,520
wait, hold on.

1044
00:55:00,520 --> 00:55:01,520
Sorry.

1045
00:55:01,520 --> 00:55:02,520
Most important question.

1046
00:55:02,520 --> 00:55:07,520
Is your husband here?

1047
00:55:07,520 --> 00:55:11,520
I appreciate you wanting to give him agency and putting himself on blast in that moment.

1048
00:55:11,520 --> 00:55:13,520
That was very kind of you said.

1049
00:55:13,520 --> 00:55:15,520
Maybe I watch him go.

1050
00:55:15,520 --> 00:55:16,520
Super excited.

1051
00:55:16,520 --> 00:55:19,520
Like, that's me.

1052
00:55:19,520 --> 00:55:23,520
Pizza mistake person.

1053
00:55:23,520 --> 00:55:26,520
Jessica, I gave him fair warning.

1054
00:55:26,520 --> 00:55:27,520
Okay.

1055
00:55:27,520 --> 00:55:32,520
I guess I was kind of hoping your question would end with.

1056
00:55:32,520 --> 00:55:37,520
So what are some great fun time tested dairy free recipes for pizza?

1057
00:55:37,520 --> 00:55:43,520
But your question was, how do I ruin pizza?

1058
00:55:43,520 --> 00:55:47,520
Which is I guess another approach to it.

1059
00:55:47,520 --> 00:55:58,520
And also you did phrase it not like how do I ruin a pizza I make for my husband, but rather how do I ruin that pizza concept of pizza?

1060
00:55:58,520 --> 00:56:04,520
You ever see a, Hey, y'all ever seen that video?

1061
00:56:04,520 --> 00:56:05,520
It's a new segment.

1062
00:56:05,520 --> 00:56:06,520
I'm a Bim Bam.

1063
00:56:06,520 --> 00:56:12,520
Hey, y'all see that video and it's like a security camera and it's the pizza delivery person.

1064
00:56:12,520 --> 00:56:13,520
The pizza falls out of the box.

1065
00:56:13,520 --> 00:56:17,520
They really quickly scoop it back up and put it in the box to give it.

1066
00:56:17,520 --> 00:56:23,520
What if we opened a chain of pizza restaurants that did that a hundred percent of the time?

1067
00:56:23,520 --> 00:56:31,520
And it was specifically catered to people whose partners had lactose intolerance or some sort of G.I. issue, but still loved the pizza.

1068
00:56:31,520 --> 00:56:36,520
But they won't after they see what we do to it.

1069
00:56:36,520 --> 00:56:40,520
There have to be pizzas without cheese on it, right?

1070
00:56:40,520 --> 00:56:43,520
You got to be able to make a pizza without cheese.

1071
00:56:43,520 --> 00:56:48,520
I mean, Daiya cheese is legit, but that's not funny.

1072
00:56:48,520 --> 00:56:49,520
All right.

1073
00:56:49,520 --> 00:56:52,520
There's so many options, but you want to hurt pizza.

1074
00:56:52,520 --> 00:56:54,520
And so that's where we are.

1075
00:56:54,520 --> 00:56:55,520
Have you?

1076
00:56:55,520 --> 00:56:57,520
Oh, you got to eat it all in front of your husband.

1077
00:56:57,520 --> 00:56:58,520
Sorry.

1078
00:56:58,520 --> 00:56:59,520
Go on.

1079
00:56:59,520 --> 00:57:01,520
Pizza the Hut, Spaceball.

1080
00:57:01,520 --> 00:57:03,520
Too scary.

1081
00:57:03,520 --> 00:57:04,520
Very disgusting.

1082
00:57:04,520 --> 00:57:05,520
Made of pizza.

1083
00:57:05,520 --> 00:57:07,520
A man of pizza.

1084
00:57:07,520 --> 00:57:08,520
No, thank you.

1085
00:57:08,520 --> 00:57:09,520
I can't eat pizza again.

1086
00:57:09,520 --> 00:57:10,520
I hate it.

1087
00:57:10,520 --> 00:57:16,520
And he'll order out for you, which I still don't know what that means.

1088
00:57:16,520 --> 00:57:21,520
Was that kind of a fun Spaceballs reference?

1089
00:57:21,520 --> 00:57:27,520
It seemed like it went over super good.

1090
00:57:27,520 --> 00:57:33,520
But now we know next time you want to make a Spaceballs reference to put it right back in your pocket.

1091
00:57:33,520 --> 00:57:34,520
It's good.

1092
00:57:34,520 --> 00:57:36,520
We have to trot those out because I didn't know and I was curious.

1093
00:57:36,520 --> 00:57:40,520
Yeah, I had 18 throughout the course of this episode and I thought I didn't know.

1094
00:57:40,520 --> 00:57:44,520
And then you tested the waters and I appreciate that.

1095
00:57:44,520 --> 00:57:45,520
You can't.

1096
00:57:45,520 --> 00:57:47,520
I just got to know you that well.

1097
00:57:47,520 --> 00:57:51,520
You're not powerful enough to ruin pizza.

1098
00:57:51,520 --> 00:57:52,520
None of us are.

1099
00:57:52,520 --> 00:57:53,520
I'm not.

1100
00:57:53,520 --> 00:57:54,520
They're not.

1101
00:57:54,520 --> 00:57:55,520
None of us are.

1102
00:57:55,520 --> 00:57:57,520
But maybe if we all work together.

1103
00:57:57,520 --> 00:57:58,520
To ruin pizza.

1104
00:57:58,520 --> 00:58:01,520
Everybody clap your hands to kill pizza forever.

1105
00:58:01,520 --> 00:58:02,520
Hey, y'all.

1106
00:58:02,520 --> 00:58:05,520
Why are you clapping?

1107
00:58:05,520 --> 00:58:07,520
It's forever.

1108
00:58:07,520 --> 00:58:11,520
We don't have much left.

1109
00:58:11,520 --> 00:58:15,520
A rat got famous for dragging it.

1110
00:58:15,520 --> 00:58:24,520
And that fucking afternoon, all of America was still like, I'll have a pizza.

1111
00:58:24,520 --> 00:58:26,520
I'll take one pizza.

1112
00:58:26,520 --> 00:58:28,520
I'll have what the rat's having.

1113
00:58:28,520 --> 00:58:29,520
For sure.

1114
00:58:29,520 --> 00:58:30,520
And you know what I'm willing to bet?

1115
00:58:30,520 --> 00:58:32,520
Sales went up.

1116
00:58:32,520 --> 00:58:33,520
Jacked through the roof.

1117
00:58:33,520 --> 00:58:36,520
That rat made people hungry for pizza.

1118
00:58:36,520 --> 00:58:39,520
But you're going to destroy pizza.

1119
00:58:39,520 --> 00:58:41,520
Doubt it.

1120
00:58:41,520 --> 00:58:44,520
Some mutant Ninja Turtles made pizza cool.

1121
00:58:44,520 --> 00:58:46,520
Paul, can we get some pizza out here or what?

1122
00:58:46,520 --> 00:58:47,520
Yeah, I know.

1123
00:58:47,520 --> 00:58:49,520
I'm dying for it.

1124
00:58:49,520 --> 00:58:50,520
Does that help?

1125
00:58:50,520 --> 00:58:56,520
Probably not because we went pretty aggro on you.

1126
00:58:56,520 --> 00:58:57,520
No, but thank you.

1127
00:58:57,520 --> 00:58:58,520
Thank you.

1128
00:58:58,520 --> 00:59:06,520
And then let's get one more lined up.

1129
00:59:06,520 --> 00:59:10,520
CJ, mezzanine, 34, row X, seat 9.

1130
00:59:10,520 --> 00:59:12,520
And Jazz.

1131
00:59:12,520 --> 00:59:13,520
Jazz.

1132
00:59:13,520 --> 00:59:14,520
Hello, Jazz.

1133
00:59:14,520 --> 00:59:15,520
Hello.

1134
00:59:15,520 --> 00:59:16,520
How's it going?

1135
00:59:16,520 --> 00:59:17,520
How's it going?

1136
00:59:17,520 --> 00:59:18,520
It's going all right.

1137
00:59:18,520 --> 00:59:19,520
I'm having a good time.

1138
00:59:19,520 --> 00:59:20,520
Well, good.

1139
00:59:20,520 --> 00:59:21,520
Good.

1140
00:59:21,520 --> 00:59:22,520
Cool.

1141
00:59:22,520 --> 00:59:23,520
Glad you're here.

1142
00:59:23,520 --> 00:59:24,520
What's up?

1143
00:59:24,520 --> 00:59:26,520
This is a question about my great grandmother, Dolores.

1144
00:59:26,520 --> 00:59:27,520
Awesome.

1145
00:59:27,520 --> 00:59:30,520
Oh, thank you for clarifying.

1146
00:59:30,520 --> 00:59:32,520
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1147
00:59:32,520 --> 00:59:35,520
And her relationship with Ryan Stiles.

1148
00:59:35,520 --> 00:59:36,520
Okay.

1149
00:59:36,520 --> 00:59:39,520
It's not sexual.

1150
00:59:39,520 --> 00:59:42,520
Oh, shit.

1151
00:59:42,520 --> 00:59:46,520
With a Ryan Stiles or with whose line is it anyways, Ryan Stiles?

1152
00:59:46,520 --> 00:59:48,520
That's the tall funny one.

1153
00:59:48,520 --> 00:59:49,520
Sure.

1154
00:59:49,520 --> 00:59:50,520
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1155
00:59:50,520 --> 00:59:53,520
So they both live up in Bellingham.

1156
00:59:53,520 --> 01:00:02,520
And she used to be Ryan Stiles' neighbor.

1157
01:00:02,520 --> 01:00:07,520
And we used to go over on 4th of July, he would go whole hog.

1158
01:00:07,520 --> 01:00:10,520
You buy a whole pig and roast it right there.

1159
01:00:10,520 --> 01:00:16,520
I was about to say, oh, I bet she has some stories, but it sounds like she actually has

1160
01:00:16,520 --> 01:00:18,520
some pretty good Ryan Stiles stories.

1161
01:00:18,520 --> 01:00:19,520
Really?

1162
01:00:19,520 --> 01:00:27,520
Yeah, and just one year we stopped going and I asked grandma and she was like, well, me

1163
01:00:27,520 --> 01:00:30,520
and Ryan kind of had a falling out.

1164
01:00:30,520 --> 01:00:34,520
Oh, no.

1165
01:00:34,520 --> 01:00:38,520
Tell me everything.

1166
01:00:38,520 --> 01:00:42,520
That's the thing is she kind of refuses to go into it.

1167
01:00:42,520 --> 01:00:44,520
Like, I think it was really bad.

1168
01:00:44,520 --> 01:00:46,520
So it's her fault.

1169
01:00:46,520 --> 01:00:47,520
It's probably her fault.

1170
01:00:47,520 --> 01:00:51,520
Because I have to say, if it was Ryan's fault, she'd tell you.

1171
01:00:51,520 --> 01:00:52,520
Yeah.

1172
01:00:52,520 --> 01:00:54,520
You got to force her.

1173
01:00:54,520 --> 01:00:56,520
Hey, Dolores, guess whose line it is?

1174
01:00:56,520 --> 01:01:00,520
It's yours.

1175
01:01:00,520 --> 01:01:03,520
Hey, hey, Dolores, I got a question for you.

1176
01:01:03,520 --> 01:01:06,520
Whose lie is it anyway?

1177
01:01:06,520 --> 01:01:07,520
Interesting.

1178
01:01:07,520 --> 01:01:08,520
One more.

1179
01:01:08,520 --> 01:01:09,520
What?

1180
01:01:09,520 --> 01:01:11,520
One more.

1181
01:01:11,520 --> 01:01:13,520
Okay.

1182
01:01:13,520 --> 01:01:22,520
Grandma, you've made a Colin Mochrie out of your relationship with Ryan Stiles.

1183
01:01:22,520 --> 01:01:24,520
This is so good.

1184
01:01:24,520 --> 01:01:25,520
What a talent.

1185
01:01:25,520 --> 01:01:27,520
It's an honor to share the stage.

1186
01:01:27,520 --> 01:01:28,520
Thank you.

1187
01:01:28,520 --> 01:01:29,520
Thank you.

1188
01:01:29,520 --> 01:01:31,520
Thank you.

1189
01:01:31,520 --> 01:01:34,520
I'm done Drew carrying the show.

1190
01:01:34,520 --> 01:01:39,520
I'm going to pass it back to my brothers.

1191
01:01:39,520 --> 01:01:40,520
Yeah, for sure.

1192
01:01:40,520 --> 01:01:43,520
You can't just yell Greg Proops at me.

1193
01:01:43,520 --> 01:01:44,520
Okay.

1194
01:01:44,520 --> 01:01:45,520
Sorry, Jess.

1195
01:01:45,520 --> 01:01:50,520
So give me literally all details available about your grandma's relationship with Ryan

1196
01:01:50,520 --> 01:01:51,520
Stiles go.

1197
01:01:51,520 --> 01:01:52,520
How close were they before?

1198
01:01:52,520 --> 01:01:53,520
How close are they now?

1199
01:01:53,520 --> 01:01:56,520
And what happened as far as you can piece together?

1200
01:01:56,520 --> 01:02:00,520
She was a lot closer with Ryan's wife, Pat.

1201
01:02:00,520 --> 01:02:01,520
Okay.

1202
01:02:01,520 --> 01:02:04,520
Damn, Pat Stiles is a good name though.

1203
01:02:04,520 --> 01:02:05,520
Oh shit.

1204
01:02:05,520 --> 01:02:07,520
This is a good Pat Stiles.

1205
01:02:07,520 --> 01:02:10,520
It hits me so much better than Ryan Stiles does.

1206
01:02:10,520 --> 01:02:14,520
Pat Stiles is dope as hell anyway.

1207
01:02:14,520 --> 01:02:17,520
But, but she's, you know, she's 91.

1208
01:02:17,520 --> 01:02:18,520
Right.

1209
01:02:18,520 --> 01:02:19,520
She's kind of a party animal.

1210
01:02:19,520 --> 01:02:22,520
Like every time I'm up there, she's always got the Crown Royal out.

1211
01:02:22,520 --> 01:02:23,520
Like.

1212
01:02:23,520 --> 01:02:25,520
Hell yeah.

1213
01:02:25,520 --> 01:02:26,520
Good grandma.

1214
01:02:26,520 --> 01:02:27,520
She's good.

1215
01:02:27,520 --> 01:02:30,520
She's choice.

1216
01:02:30,520 --> 01:02:33,520
And she's here tonight.

1217
01:02:33,520 --> 01:02:40,520
It just feels like Ryan, it's not Ryan's fault, but I also feel like by the time you hit 91,

1218
01:02:40,520 --> 01:02:43,520
can you really hold a grudge against a 91 year old?

1219
01:02:43,520 --> 01:02:46,520
I'm confused as to how this beef came about.

1220
01:02:46,520 --> 01:02:53,520
I kind of feel like she just got pretty salty that he didn't like invite her to a party

1221
01:02:53,520 --> 01:02:54,520
or something.

1222
01:02:54,520 --> 01:02:56,520
Cause that sounds like small, slight.

1223
01:02:56,520 --> 01:02:57,520
Yeah.

1224
01:02:57,520 --> 01:02:58,520
Yeah.

1225
01:02:58,520 --> 01:03:05,520
But like he'll still run into her like in Bellingham and be like, dude, we can't keep

1226
01:03:05,520 --> 01:03:06,520
meeting like this.

1227
01:03:06,520 --> 01:03:07,520
All right.

1228
01:03:07,520 --> 01:03:08,520
Hold up.

1229
01:03:08,520 --> 01:03:09,520
Hold up.

1230
01:03:09,520 --> 01:03:10,520
Hold up.

1231
01:03:10,520 --> 01:03:11,520
Hold up.

1232
01:03:11,520 --> 01:03:13,520
Have we gotten into fan fiction territory?

1233
01:03:13,520 --> 01:03:20,520
No, it was her birthday in August and I like brought it up again just to see like if she

1234
01:03:20,520 --> 01:03:22,520
could tell me anything else about it.

1235
01:03:22,520 --> 01:03:26,520
And she was like, I'm still mad at Ryan Stiles.

1236
01:03:26,520 --> 01:03:30,520
Okay, wait, wait, wait, wait.

1237
01:03:30,520 --> 01:03:32,520
This is just one thought.

1238
01:03:32,520 --> 01:03:39,520
Do you have a twin that Ryan Stiles is the grandmother of?

1239
01:03:39,520 --> 01:03:42,520
Because maybe you two could switch places.

1240
01:03:42,520 --> 01:03:49,520
Oh, and then they would have to get back together.

1241
01:03:49,520 --> 01:03:52,520
Kind of what that is that.

1242
01:03:52,520 --> 01:03:54,520
Do you?

1243
01:03:54,520 --> 01:03:56,520
I'm an only child.

1244
01:03:56,520 --> 01:03:57,520
Okay.

1245
01:03:57,520 --> 01:03:58,520
As far as you know.

1246
01:03:58,520 --> 01:04:02,520
Yeah, she didn't actually know in that movie until she found out.

1247
01:04:02,520 --> 01:04:05,520
Nothing we say is legally binding.

1248
01:04:05,520 --> 01:04:08,520
Oh, don't say what you're about to say, bud.

1249
01:04:08,520 --> 01:04:15,520
You need to put Ryan Stiles in a life threatening situation where your grandma.

1250
01:04:15,520 --> 01:04:16,520
Does that help, Jess?

1251
01:04:16,520 --> 01:04:17,520
Has to rescue him.

1252
01:04:17,520 --> 01:04:18,520
Does that help?

1253
01:04:18,520 --> 01:04:19,520
Just say yes.

1254
01:04:19,520 --> 01:04:20,520
You can't let Travis go on.

1255
01:04:20,520 --> 01:04:23,520
Then your grandma rescues Ryan Stiles and they're friends again.

1256
01:04:23,520 --> 01:04:24,520
Okay, thank you, Jess.

1257
01:04:24,520 --> 01:04:25,520
Does that help?

1258
01:04:25,520 --> 01:04:26,520
Just pretend it helps.

1259
01:04:26,520 --> 01:04:27,520
Thank you, Jess.

1260
01:04:27,520 --> 01:04:28,520
RJ.

1261
01:04:28,520 --> 01:04:29,520
Hey, what's up?

1262
01:04:29,520 --> 01:04:38,520
Thank you for buying a poster, RJ.

1263
01:04:38,520 --> 01:04:42,520
If you'd like one of your very own, if you got great taste like RJ, you can pick them

1264
01:04:42,520 --> 01:04:43,520
up out in the lobby.

1265
01:04:43,520 --> 01:04:44,520
Let's see those posters.

1266
01:04:44,520 --> 01:04:45,520
Who's got posters?

1267
01:04:45,520 --> 01:04:46,520
Thank you.

1268
01:04:46,520 --> 01:04:49,520
That is not enough of you.

1269
01:04:49,520 --> 01:04:50,520
Everybody needs them.

1270
01:04:50,520 --> 01:04:53,520
You look like a snow bank out there.

1271
01:04:53,520 --> 01:04:55,520
Will all the posters buy two?

1272
01:04:55,520 --> 01:04:56,520
What is your question?

1273
01:04:56,520 --> 01:04:59,520
That was so fucking gross.

1274
01:04:59,520 --> 01:05:01,520
What just happened on the stage?

1275
01:05:01,520 --> 01:05:03,520
I just want everybody to buy a poster.

1276
01:05:03,520 --> 01:05:04,520
Nice posters.

1277
01:05:04,520 --> 01:05:05,520
Hey, what's up?

1278
01:05:05,520 --> 01:05:11,520
So somebody from my college got signed by a British hockey team and in their press release

1279
01:05:11,520 --> 01:05:13,520
they're like, hey, we don't have a lot of money.

1280
01:05:13,520 --> 01:05:17,520
If you buy the jersey for us, we'll give it to you at the end of the season.

1281
01:05:17,520 --> 01:05:18,520
I was like, yeah, sure.

1282
01:05:18,520 --> 01:05:20,520
After it got stinked on?

1283
01:05:20,520 --> 01:05:23,520
I mean, I hope they clean it.

1284
01:05:23,520 --> 01:05:26,520
I think they have washers in England.

1285
01:05:26,520 --> 01:05:27,520
Okay.

1286
01:05:27,520 --> 01:05:31,520
They have a fun name for it, though.

1287
01:05:31,520 --> 01:05:32,520
Washers.

1288
01:05:32,520 --> 01:05:36,520
Like a clothing loo.

1289
01:05:36,520 --> 01:05:39,520
Or like scrub-a-dovers.

1290
01:05:39,520 --> 01:05:40,520
All right.

1291
01:05:40,520 --> 01:05:41,520
Sorry.

1292
01:05:41,520 --> 01:05:46,520
But then they email me back and say, all right, so what do you want on the jersey?

1293
01:05:46,520 --> 01:05:50,520
And I don't have like a business or anything that I can advertise.

1294
01:05:50,520 --> 01:05:53,520
Even if you did.

1295
01:05:53,520 --> 01:06:00,520
Even if you did, come to my Seattle-based haberdashery.

1296
01:06:00,520 --> 01:06:03,520
Or what if it just said on the front RJs?

1297
01:06:03,520 --> 01:06:04,520
Ooh.

1298
01:06:04,520 --> 01:06:05,520
Yeah.

1299
01:06:05,520 --> 01:06:07,520
I'm assuming you're asking us what to put on the fucking jerseys.

1300
01:06:07,520 --> 01:06:08,520
Okay.

1301
01:06:08,520 --> 01:06:10,520
Or just said mine.

1302
01:06:10,520 --> 01:06:11,520
Ooh.

1303
01:06:11,520 --> 01:06:14,520
That's definitely a joke from Talladega Knights, so we're getting somewhere.

1304
01:06:14,520 --> 01:06:16,520
It worked for them.

1305
01:06:16,520 --> 01:06:21,520
What about basketball?

1306
01:06:21,520 --> 01:06:28,520
Whatever you did, I mean, what would you do if you saw a hockey jersey and it said basketball?

1307
01:06:28,520 --> 01:06:29,520
Oh.

1308
01:06:29,520 --> 01:06:30,520
Referee.

1309
01:06:30,520 --> 01:06:32,520
That's really good.

1310
01:06:32,520 --> 01:06:36,520
Black and white pinstripes like a referee for hockey wears.

1311
01:06:36,520 --> 01:06:38,520
And then you can blend in.

1312
01:06:38,520 --> 01:06:39,520
Stealth.

1313
01:06:39,520 --> 01:06:45,520
Make it like ice-colored and the pants too.

1314
01:06:45,520 --> 01:06:55,520
They'll never see you coming, which is probably extremely bad for hockey.

1315
01:06:55,520 --> 01:06:56,520
Duncan is good.

1316
01:06:56,520 --> 01:06:59,520
Duncan's good.

1317
01:06:59,520 --> 01:07:00,520
For sure.

1318
01:07:00,520 --> 01:07:03,520
This is one that's just fun for the announcers.

1319
01:07:03,520 --> 01:07:07,520
Each one has a different player's last name on the front.

1320
01:07:07,520 --> 01:07:12,520
So it's like, if it's like, I don't know, Stevens, it says Johnson on the front.

1321
01:07:12,520 --> 01:07:13,520
I love that.

1322
01:07:13,520 --> 01:07:14,520
Wait, no.

1323
01:07:14,520 --> 01:07:15,520
Fuck.

1324
01:07:15,520 --> 01:07:16,520
No, wait.

1325
01:07:16,520 --> 01:07:17,520
Johnson has Stevens.

1326
01:07:17,520 --> 01:07:18,520
Shit.

1327
01:07:18,520 --> 01:07:19,520
Hold on.

1328
01:07:19,520 --> 01:07:24,520
Hey, how about a bunch of like bubble wrap?

1329
01:07:24,520 --> 01:07:25,520
Because it's dangerous.

1330
01:07:25,520 --> 01:07:31,520
RJ, do you have any favorite bubble verses?

1331
01:07:31,520 --> 01:07:36,520
That's something I wanted to ask you to talk about while I try to come up with an answer

1332
01:07:36,520 --> 01:07:37,520
for your question.

1333
01:07:37,520 --> 01:07:39,520
So we could chat about it.

1334
01:07:39,520 --> 01:07:44,520
Do you have any gut feeling, like what are you actually going to do when you ignore all

1335
01:07:44,520 --> 01:07:45,520
the bullshit?

1336
01:07:45,520 --> 01:07:48,520
What did you actually do two weeks ago?

1337
01:07:48,520 --> 01:07:51,520
I was thinking of just putting my Twitter handle for like the internet cloud.

1338
01:07:51,520 --> 01:07:52,520
Fuck, that's so much better.

1339
01:07:52,520 --> 01:07:54,520
That's really better than anything we've said.

1340
01:07:54,520 --> 01:07:55,520
Way better than any of us.

1341
01:07:55,520 --> 01:07:58,520
But in your defense, you had way longer to think about it than we did.

1342
01:07:58,520 --> 01:08:00,520
Okay, I'll top that.

1343
01:08:00,520 --> 01:08:04,520
Your PayPal link.

1344
01:08:04,520 --> 01:08:06,520
And maybe on the bottom says like, this was a mistake.

1345
01:08:06,520 --> 01:08:08,520
And they're like, no, it wasn't.

1346
01:08:08,520 --> 01:08:10,520
Five dollars.

1347
01:08:10,520 --> 01:08:11,520
Does that help?

1348
01:08:11,520 --> 01:08:12,520
Cool.

1349
01:08:12,520 --> 01:08:13,520
Cool.

1350
01:08:13,520 --> 01:08:14,520
Thanks.

1351
01:08:14,520 --> 01:08:15,520
Just happy to be here.

1352
01:08:15,520 --> 01:08:16,520
That's RJ.

1353
01:08:16,520 --> 01:08:20,520
That was an easy one.

1354
01:08:20,520 --> 01:08:21,520
Hello, CJ?

1355
01:08:21,520 --> 01:08:22,520
Yes, CJ.

1356
01:08:22,520 --> 01:08:23,520
Fantastic.

1357
01:08:23,520 --> 01:08:24,520
Hi.

1358
01:08:24,520 --> 01:08:25,520
Hey.

1359
01:08:25,520 --> 01:08:27,520
So my grandparents have a big ranch.

1360
01:08:27,520 --> 01:08:31,520
A lot of grandparent based queries this episode.

1361
01:08:31,520 --> 01:08:34,520
I know, I was worried.

1362
01:08:34,520 --> 01:08:35,520
Grandparents, CJ, RJ.

1363
01:08:35,520 --> 01:08:36,520
Yeah, no, sorry.

1364
01:08:36,520 --> 01:08:37,520
Yes.

1365
01:08:37,520 --> 01:08:41,520
So they have a big ranch and the county has told them that they're just going to build

1366
01:08:41,520 --> 01:08:44,520
a road through the middle of it.

1367
01:08:44,520 --> 01:08:45,520
Eminent delay.

1368
01:08:45,520 --> 01:08:46,520
Yeah.

1369
01:08:46,520 --> 01:08:47,520
That's bad.

1370
01:08:47,520 --> 01:08:50,520
I mean, we're not leaving here tonight until we fix it.

1371
01:08:50,520 --> 01:08:51,520
Sit in.

1372
01:08:51,520 --> 01:08:52,520
Sit.

1373
01:08:52,520 --> 01:08:55,520
Everybody, chain yourselves to your seats.

1374
01:08:55,520 --> 01:08:57,520
We do need to leave though because we have another show tomorrow.

1375
01:08:57,520 --> 01:09:02,520
Yeah, we'll be headed out after the show, but you all hang in there.

1376
01:09:02,520 --> 01:09:03,520
And you're the real heroes.

1377
01:09:03,520 --> 01:09:06,520
And we're with you in spirit.

1378
01:09:06,520 --> 01:09:07,520
Sorry.

1379
01:09:07,520 --> 01:09:12,520
Well, the consolation prize is that they get to name the road.

1380
01:09:12,520 --> 01:09:13,520
Oh, okay.

1381
01:09:13,520 --> 01:09:19,520
And my grandparents have asked me and my brother and sister, what should we name our road?

1382
01:09:19,520 --> 01:09:23,520
Because their only idea was Rabbit Road because they own rabbits.

1383
01:09:23,520 --> 01:09:24,520
That's fine.

1384
01:09:24,520 --> 01:09:26,520
What about Route 66?

1385
01:09:26,520 --> 01:09:27,520
That's fine.

1386
01:09:27,520 --> 01:09:28,520
That's good.

1387
01:09:28,520 --> 01:09:38,520
What about Fuck This Local Government Boulevard?

1388
01:09:38,520 --> 01:09:41,520
I don't know if they'll let you say fuck on a street sign though.

1389
01:09:41,520 --> 01:09:42,520
Probably not.

1390
01:09:42,520 --> 01:09:43,520
Probably not.

1391
01:09:43,520 --> 01:09:49,520
Do you have any favorite Bible verses?

1392
01:09:49,520 --> 01:09:55,520
There is another road down the street that is named Matthew's some number.

1393
01:09:55,520 --> 01:09:56,520
I don't know.

1394
01:09:56,520 --> 01:09:58,520
So it's like already been taken by someone else.

1395
01:09:58,520 --> 01:09:59,520
What if the-

1396
01:09:59,520 --> 01:10:00,520
Wait.

1397
01:10:00,520 --> 01:10:01,520
What if it-

1398
01:10:01,520 --> 01:10:02,520
Wait.

1399
01:10:02,520 --> 01:10:06,520
Are you fucking with me right now?

1400
01:10:06,520 --> 01:10:11,520
Are you telling me that I am suggesting Bible verse and you're like, no, the people next

1401
01:10:11,520 --> 01:10:14,520
door actually did Bible verse.

1402
01:10:14,520 --> 01:10:17,520
So.

1403
01:10:17,520 --> 01:10:22,520
Montana has very lax laws about what you can name roads.

1404
01:10:22,520 --> 01:10:23,520
Okay.

1405
01:10:23,520 --> 01:10:25,520
So maybe Fuck The Local Government Boulevard.

1406
01:10:25,520 --> 01:10:27,520
That's not bad.

1407
01:10:27,520 --> 01:10:30,520
What about Stop Road?

1408
01:10:30,520 --> 01:10:33,520
Oh shit.

1409
01:10:33,520 --> 01:10:39,520
Or a 90 mile an hour road can be super fun.

1410
01:10:39,520 --> 01:10:42,520
Street Road Avenue.

1411
01:10:42,520 --> 01:10:48,520
How do your grandparents feel about emojis?

1412
01:10:48,520 --> 01:10:54,520
My grandpa loves emojis and he is very active on Snapchat.

1413
01:10:54,520 --> 01:10:56,520
Get that handle out.

1414
01:10:56,520 --> 01:11:00,520
Let's everybody follow your grandpa tonight.

1415
01:11:00,520 --> 01:11:01,520
Yeah.

1416
01:11:01,520 --> 01:11:03,520
I'm going to need actually that grandpa's handle.

1417
01:11:03,520 --> 01:11:04,520
Let me get that.

1418
01:11:04,520 --> 01:11:07,520
Hey, give me that grandpa handle real quick.

1419
01:11:07,520 --> 01:11:11,520
Just into the microphone is fine.

1420
01:11:11,520 --> 01:11:12,520
Yes.

1421
01:11:12,520 --> 01:11:13,520
Pull out your phone.

1422
01:11:13,520 --> 01:11:14,520
Look at it.

1423
01:11:14,520 --> 01:11:15,520
I saw you.

1424
01:11:15,520 --> 01:11:16,520
Yes.

1425
01:11:16,520 --> 01:11:17,520
Take the time.

1426
01:11:17,520 --> 01:11:18,520
Everybody else.

1427
01:11:18,520 --> 01:11:25,520
I don't know how to access Snapchat, but we're all going to follow this grandpa tonight.

1428
01:11:25,520 --> 01:11:27,520
Get your phones out.

1429
01:11:27,520 --> 01:11:28,520
Get your phones out.

1430
01:11:28,520 --> 01:11:30,520
Follow this grandpa.

1431
01:11:30,520 --> 01:11:35,520
Definitely make it a Snapchat handles Avenue is extremely good.

1432
01:11:35,520 --> 01:11:36,520
All right.

1433
01:11:36,520 --> 01:11:40,520
So to give a little bit of context for this.

1434
01:11:40,520 --> 01:11:43,520
Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

1435
01:11:43,520 --> 01:11:46,520
I am trusting you to use your best judgment as to whether or not you should go sit down.

1436
01:11:46,520 --> 01:11:56,520
I actually am not his friend on Snapchat because I don't want to know what he does.

1437
01:11:56,520 --> 01:11:58,520
You should go say thank you.

1438
01:11:58,520 --> 01:12:00,520
Thank you so much, CJ.

1439
01:12:00,520 --> 01:12:06,520
We have to protect you and ourselves and maybe your grandpa from this.

1440
01:12:06,520 --> 01:12:07,520
Maybe the US.

1441
01:12:07,520 --> 01:12:08,520
Yes.

1442
01:12:08,520 --> 01:12:11,520
Does that help a little bit?

1443
01:12:11,520 --> 01:12:12,520
Thank you so much.

1444
01:12:12,520 --> 01:12:13,520
Thank you.

1445
01:12:13,520 --> 01:12:16,520
All right.

1446
01:12:16,520 --> 01:12:20,520
Hey, folks, that's going to do it for our show.

1447
01:12:20,520 --> 01:12:22,520
We'll be turning the old house sites.

1448
01:12:22,520 --> 01:12:24,520
Thank you.

1449
01:12:24,520 --> 01:12:26,520
Thank you.

1450
01:12:26,520 --> 01:12:30,520
Thank you so much to the Paramount.

1451
01:12:30,520 --> 01:12:31,520
Yes.

1452
01:12:31,520 --> 01:12:32,520
This theater is absolutely incredible.

1453
01:12:32,520 --> 01:12:33,520
Thank you, Paramount.

1454
01:12:33,520 --> 01:12:35,520
Thank you to John Roderick again.

1455
01:12:35,520 --> 01:12:37,520
That was amazing.

1456
01:12:37,520 --> 01:12:44,520
We have been fans of his music for so long, and it's so cool that not only do we get to know him,

1457
01:12:44,520 --> 01:12:50,520
but that he has played for two of our shows now is the fucking coolest shit, unimaginably cool.

1458
01:12:50,520 --> 01:12:55,520
Thanks to our daddy for helping us.

1459
01:12:55,520 --> 01:12:57,520
Thank you to Sawbones.

1460
01:12:57,520 --> 01:13:00,520
Go preorder the Sawbones book right now.

1461
01:13:00,520 --> 01:13:02,520
How can people preorder the Sawbones book?

1462
01:13:02,520 --> 01:13:05,520
Bit.ly forward slash the Sawbones book.

1463
01:13:05,520 --> 01:13:06,520
I have a copy.

1464
01:13:06,520 --> 01:13:09,520
It's fantastic, and I hate books.

1465
01:13:09,520 --> 01:13:16,520
Thank you to Seattle, I believe it's called, for having us.

1466
01:13:16,520 --> 01:13:27,520
Thank you to our various family members, without whom we would not be able to be here tonight, whether it is they are backstage or they are at a home.

1467
01:13:27,520 --> 01:13:28,520
Thank you, Max Fun.

1468
01:13:28,520 --> 01:13:30,520
MaxFunFun.org.

1469
01:13:30,520 --> 01:13:31,520
Thank you to Paul.

1470
01:13:31,520 --> 01:13:32,520
Did we thank Paul?

1471
01:13:32,520 --> 01:13:33,520
Oh, Paul.

1472
01:13:33,520 --> 01:13:44,520
We are not going to be hanging out after the show, because I have been up for a really ridiculous amount of time.

1473
01:13:44,520 --> 01:13:46,520
5 a.m. for me, kids.

1474
01:13:46,520 --> 01:13:48,520
Time zones are no joke.

1475
01:13:48,520 --> 01:13:49,520
Daughters don't know.

1476
01:13:49,520 --> 01:13:55,520
We will be here tomorrow for Taz, and I hope the folks who got tickets for that are going to have a good time.

1477
01:13:55,520 --> 01:13:57,520
There are the posters out in the lobby.

1478
01:13:57,520 --> 01:13:58,520
Posters in the lobby, yes.

1479
01:13:58,520 --> 01:14:00,520
Sarah Grayly designed those.

1480
01:14:00,520 --> 01:14:01,520
Thank you, Sarah.

1481
01:14:01,520 --> 01:14:02,520
They are beautiful posters.

1482
01:14:02,520 --> 01:14:03,520

01:14:03,520 --> 01:14:04,520
Sent in by Jack Bannon.

1484
01:14:04,520 --> 01:14:05,520
Thank you, Jack.

1485
01:14:05,520 --> 01:14:13,520
Yahoo Answers user Theo, who asks, I accidentally ate the do not eat packet inside my shoe box.

1486
01:14:13,520 --> 01:14:16,520
Am I going to die?

1487
01:14:16,520 --> 01:14:17,520
My name is Justin McElroy.

1488
01:14:17,520 --> 01:14:18,520
I'm Travis McElroy.

1489
01:14:18,520 --> 01:14:19,520
I'm Griffin McElroy.

1490
01:14:19,520 --> 01:14:20,520
This has been my brother.

1491
01:14:20,520 --> 01:14:23,520
My brother may kiss your dad's square on the lips.

1492
01:14:23,520 --> 01:14:43,520
Music

Listener supported.

1497
01:14:48,520 --> 01:14:53,520
Is there a dog in a car at a bar on the street?

1498
01:14:53,520 --> 01:14:55,520
I'm like Ringo, a small dog owner.

1499
01:14:55,520 --> 01:14:57,520
My dog pistachio howls when she's excited.

1500
01:14:57,520 --> 01:14:59,520
And I'm Rudy Culvert, a big dog owner.

1501
01:14:59,520 --> 01:15:01,520
My dog Tugboat tips over when he's sleepy.

1502
01:15:01,520 --> 01:15:05,520
And we co-host a podcast called Can I Pet Your Dog that airs every Tuesday.

1503
01:15:05,520 --> 01:15:06,520
We bring you all things dog.

1504
01:15:06,520 --> 01:15:07,520
Yes.

We also have pretty famous guests on.

1509
01:15:11,520 --> 01:15:12,520
But legs.

1510
01:15:12,520 --> 01:15:14,520
We're not going to let them talk about their projects.

1511
01:15:14,520 --> 01:15:15,520
Just want to hear about those dogs.

1512
01:15:15,520 --> 01:15:16,520
We don't want to hear about your stuff.

1513
01:15:16,520 --> 01:15:17,520
Only your dogs.

1514
01:15:17,520 --> 01:15:19,520
So join us every Tuesday on Max Fun.
