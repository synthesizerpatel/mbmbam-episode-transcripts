1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:30,640
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:47,360
Hello everybody, and welcome to my brother and my brother meeting advice show for the

6
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:52,880
modern era. My name is Justin Mc... I'm gonna get this right. No, that was it.

7
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:58,160
No, he's got to say, I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy. Aw, damn. That's not it.

8
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:00,960
Hello everybody, and welcome to my brother and my brother meeting advice show for the

9
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:04,240
modern era. I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy. I'm your middle-est brother, Travis

10
00:01:04,240 --> 00:01:08,560
McElroy. I'm your sweet baby brother, Griffin McElroy. No fooling around with this intro.

11
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:13,120
No, straight to the point, no faking. Cooking MCs like a pound of bacon.

12
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:18,880
What's that noise? That's Justin being very cold. Justin, how's the weather where you are?

13
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:30,640
Thanks for asking, Travis. It is a tropical winter storm. Jareth is having its way with us

14
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:40,240
right now, and let me tell you guys, winter prep is so important when you're in blizzard

15
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:49,520
conditions. Light or death. I almost wasn't ready. Oh, no. But listen, I don't want you to worry. I

16
00:01:49,520 --> 00:02:00,000
am now sitting here with a, I would guess, 20 to 25 ASMR videos just stacked. That'll get you

17
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:06,400
through. Yeah, I loaded the hard drive. I got an external hard drive. How big are these fucking

18
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:15,360
ASMR videos? How big is the hard drive? I get them in HHD. That's just high, high definition?

19
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:23,360
High, high definition. As far as winter prep goes, I've got probably 25 ASMR videos.

20
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,440
I'm glad that you've been listening to Bunker Buddies because when we did our winter prep

21
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:32,400
episode, we said the number one priority was ASMR because what you don't want to do is wait

22
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:37,280
till the storm hits and then everyone's rushing to the store like, wait, here's the ASMR videos.

23
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:42,640
And it's just like, we sold out of those weeks ago. See, for my money, I like, because you're

24
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:49,840
going to be trapped inside for, God, months potentially, I like the idea of just me and the

25
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:55,360
kids and we all get together and we make our own ASMR videos. We get some crinkly paper. We get some

26
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:59,920
crinkly paper of our own and we talk really, really soft up close on a microphone together.

27
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:03,520
Get some press on nails to tap on a wooden table.

28
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:08,640
Kind of dig your fingers through those glass beads that you put in aquariums.

29
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:11,200
That sounds actually pretty good, Travis.

30
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:15,360
Well, the last thing you want to do, especially if you're trapped in the house, is get some like

31
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:19,760
cut rate bargain basement ASMR videos where it's just like a dude being like,

32
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:23,680
I'm going to rub your head. Like you don't want that. You know, you want like,

33
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:29,120
if you're going to be listening to it for years, possibly, you want it to be like the best quality

34
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:32,160
you can get. And that's why I always do glass beads.

35
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:36,800
In the last, in the last winter storm we had, I wasn't prepared and I bought some

36
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:41,520
unlicensed ASMR from a guy at a dark alleyway and it turned out to just be

37
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:44,400
Wendy's training videos for how to use the shake machine.

38
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:47,520
That's not a trigger.

39
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:50,400
Buddy, buddy, buddy, you're looking for some soft sounds.

40
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:51,680
Soft sounds over here.

41
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:54,160
Soft sounds, soft serve. Get over here, my man.

42
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:58,240
He kind of spoke in ASMR, which is pretty amazing.

43
00:03:58,240 --> 00:04:01,920
Which is my trigger. Back alley ASMR is actually one of my triggers.

44
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:03,760
Ah, damn it. I forgot food.

45
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:05,760
Well, shit.

46
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:07,040
You're going to have to eat your cat.

47
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:08,400
Going to have to eat my food.

48
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:09,200
Going to alf it up.

49
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:13,200
Alfin it up. I said, what?

50
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:17,280
Listen, the only thing that's going to get you through now, Justin, is you have to lower your

51
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:23,280
heart rate and your intake consumption levels to a very, very low, like just barely alive point.

52
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:26,880
Like you're going to need to get into a bathtub. And I think actually the ASMR videos

53
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:29,680
might help you out with this to just to get you on that bliss.

54
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:33,280
But then you're going to have some videos to bring you back from the point of death.

55
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:37,760
Some like heavy metal monster truck kind of thing to get the blood rate,

56
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:40,000
you know, back up once like June hits.

57
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,680
Just a monster truck just driving over a bunch of different heavy metal bands.

58
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:45,520
I've, uh, I'm, uh,

59
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:48,160
A snuff film of heavy metal bands.

60
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:50,480
Which is the natural opposite to ASMR.

61
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:50,880
Yes.

62
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:55,440
I am conserving my ASMR videos too. I'm trying to make, not use them all up.

63
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:57,120
So I got the window shrugged down.

64
00:04:57,120 --> 00:05:01,280
So I'm only seeking about a quarter of, of them as I'm watching them.

65
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:04,080
Cause I don't want to burn through them all, all at once.

66
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:06,720
You know, that seems foolhardy just cause I got a big stack.

67
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:10,080
You know what sucks is I'm in, I'm in Texas and the weather here is great, but I still,

68
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:12,320
you know, I don't like to leave the house basically ever.

69
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:18,880
Um, so last time I was out at the store, I bought like 40 hams, but I didn't get any ASMR videos.

70
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:20,160
That's so stupid.

71
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:22,800
Listen, let's get on with the advice.

72
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:30,160
I feel my generator's about to die and I have to save enough energy to watch ASMR videos for

73
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:31,280
the rest of the weekend.

74
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:31,760
Yeah, sure.

75
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:34,320
So I really, are you doing okay though?

76
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:35,440
This is the real brother part.

77
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:37,520
Yeah, but really, are you all right?

78
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:37,760
No.

79
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:39,520
I mean, we were like wicked prepared.

80
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:40,880
Like, let me say this.

81
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:42,560
It sucks.

82
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:47,040
Like, cause it's like, it's weird because you don't really think about the closest

83
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:48,320
comparisons like Christmas.

84
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:51,680
It's like, well, I better, I hope you have everything cause you can't get nothing.

85
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:56,480
Like, it's like that, but could last for days cause I can't get nothing.

86
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:58,880
You can't get, you literally can't get anything.

87
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:00,080
Can't get anything.

88
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:02,640
I, uh, yeah, I can't get anything.

89
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:03,440
I made a run.

90
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:04,480
This was scary.

91
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:06,240
I almost didn't have Ramchata.

92
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:07,040
Ooh.

93
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:07,440
All right.

94
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:08,240
Let's start the show.

95
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:12,400
This is, this is your, your privilege has been showing for the past seven minutes and

96
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:13,360
it's making me sick.

97
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:15,920
Uh, put your privilege away.

98
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:19,280
I was kidding about the Ramchata, but I also did not have Brandy.

99
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:23,520
So it was like a winter storm without the kvassia.

100
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:24,560
I would rather not.

101
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:24,960
Thank you.

102
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:27,760
Um, where do you, hey, can I ask you a question?

103
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:28,800
Where do you winter storm?

104
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:29,760
Oh, me?

105
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:31,920
I go to Justin's lodge.

106
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:35,040
We have Ramchata and Brandy drinks mixed together.

107
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:40,160
We listen to soft sounds and we just try to lower our heart rate down to just a barely

108
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:41,280
alive level.

109
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:42,880
It's really the only way to do it.

110
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:45,840
It's the, it's the only way to winter storm.

111
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:50,800
I keep looking outside thinking that it would have slowed or perhaps slacked or perhaps

112
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:52,880
stopped in any way.

113
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:53,120
Nah.

114
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:56,080
It is still going like full tilt boogie the same as it was.

115
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:59,360
This is so weird because we're recording this in the past when people are listening

116
00:06:59,360 --> 00:06:59,920
to it.

117
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:04,240
Like people could be listening to this long after we've lost contact with Justin.

118
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:06,800
This could be my last like transmission.

119
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:09,120
This could be like your Martian still haven't seen it.

120
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:09,760
Please, please listen.

121
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:10,560
This is crucial.

122
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:11,920
I have a baby.

123
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:15,360
If this is my last transmission, this is so important.

124
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:21,360
Please bring a portable television and hold up ASMR videos to my office window and just

125
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:22,720
smash it with a brick.

126
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:24,720
I just have to hear those soft singles.

127
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:29,920
Um, I will say if this is your last episode, that's really too bad because we've spent

128
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:33,600
the last eight minutes of the show's 60 minute runtime talking about the weather.

129
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:39,600
Yeah, but the good news is no one will think of it as the one where they talk about ASMR.

130
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:41,040
That'll be the last one.

131
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:44,480
Last one in the series of like 40.

132
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:47,360
When we finally hit on that hilarious weather chat.

133
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:47,920
Let's do it.

134
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:49,120
Let's do it.

135
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:54,400
My wife's dad, two brothers and brother-in-law all go on a yearly grouper fishing trip.

136
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:55,680
How do you fish?

137
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:56,080
Yeah.

138
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:57,600
How do you like designate?

139
00:07:57,600 --> 00:07:59,200
Like, all right, only the grouper.

140
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:00,960
Come on up and bite.

141
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:01,680
Bite this shit.

142
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:03,440
Maybe they just go to like a grouper farm.

143
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:04,720
Get the fuck out of here, Cod.

144
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:06,080
It's grouper time, groupers.

145
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:08,000
It's time for the reckoning.

146
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:08,800
You know what's up.

147
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:10,640
Well, I would.

148
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:11,840
Come on up here.

149
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:17,280
I mean, I would imagine that you, it would be based on your bait, right?

150
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,240
You use like grouper dogs.

151
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:22,240
The favorite grouper snacks.

152
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:24,000
The favorite grouper crisps.

153
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:24,960
Oh, that's my favorite.

154
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:31,280
If you're doing, if you're doing like grouper trolling out Miami, it's a pretty easy tactic

155
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:34,800
to catch decent sized gag groupers on a shallow patch reef.

156
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:36,720
Just get a standard 50 pound trolling outfit.

157
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:37,600
That'll do the job.

158
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:42,160
Yeah, you unfurl a waterproof grouper pornographic magazine.

159
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:44,640
Took me a couple of runs at that one.

160
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:49,520
Just make sure you use a strong shock leader of approximately 25 feet connected by crimps

161
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:50,480
to a hundred pounds.

162
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:53,280
Salmon pornography will work too.

163
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:55,120
Groupers are really down to clown with just anything.

164
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:56,320
They're very open minded fish.

165
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:57,120
They're pretty dirty.

166
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:59,200
Anyway, we're on a grouper fishing trip.

167
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:00,480
Right now.

168
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:02,240
They're all pretty strong fishermen.

169
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:03,040
No, wait.

170
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:04,320
They're all pretty strong men.

171
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:06,720
I've gone the past two years.

172
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:08,800
The first year I wasn't able to pull up a fish.

173
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:10,320
Yeah, she's a heavy fish, the grouper.

174
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:12,480
Second year I got seasick.

175
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:15,360
The second year I got seasick.

176
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:17,920
Should I bow out of all future trips?

177
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:20,160
Should I keep going for the camaraderie?

178
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:23,360
They give me a hard time about it, but will probably still make fun of me for not going.

179
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:26,560
Frustrated fishing failure.

180
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:28,880
You have to go.

181
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:29,840
You have to go.

182
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:36,160
But like one of these years, can you please show up and just be diesel?

183
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:37,040
Like what better?

184
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:41,440
What would be better than to be like, anybody, any of you need help lifting fish?

185
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:44,240
Oh God, what happened to Dave?

186
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:45,280
I'm worried about him.

187
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:46,880
I got fish lifters, baby.

188
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:53,040
Oh my God, have you seen Dave lately?

189
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:55,920
Look at his just glistening fish lifters.

190
00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:00,880
His shirt is big enough for my chest, but not my fish lifters.

191
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:02,400
Has he been dead lifting fish?

192
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:07,040
I wouldn't mind having those fish lifters wrapped all around me in the cold.

193
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:09,760
They're only for fish, Victoria.

194
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:12,800
I lift fish and I lift spirits.

195
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:15,760
I lift fish and I lift that nationwide morale.

196
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:17,440
Victoria, would you mind opening the door for me?

197
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:21,280
I'm holding two bags of groceries and both your hands are free.

198
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:23,680
Victoria, you know the arrangement.

199
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:25,200
These are fish lifters.

200
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:26,640
I have to impress your brothers.

201
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:30,000
I can't use these for anything other than lifting fish.

202
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,960
I want a divorce, Dave.

203
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:34,400
Can I still go on the fishing trip?

204
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:36,400
Please don't take this away from me.

205
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:40,960
Having big, sick fish lifters is going to be a very good move,

206
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:42,800
and you can use that for a lot of things.

207
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:44,880
And I feel like that's another catch-all for us.

208
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:50,080
Just get extremely physically attractive or get extremely, extremely powerful,

209
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:52,080
like really very powerful fish diesel.

210
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:54,080
He's my favorite actor.

211
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:58,720
One sweet thing would be to act like you have huge fish lifters

212
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:00,720
and then act like you can't lift the fish.

213
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:02,800
Like say, oh, it's too heavy.

214
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:05,120
Oh yeah, put a dramatic arc into your hang.

215
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:07,680
Oh, and then it's a really tiny fish and everybody gets a good laugh.

216
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:08,560
A lot of bad stuff happens.

217
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:10,960
I was just going to say, you could tear it in half.

218
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:13,360
Just tear it in half while they watch and then lift.

219
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:14,560
You're like, that's better.

220
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:16,000
That's much easier.

221
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:16,640
He did it.

222
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:17,760
He's the chosen one.

223
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:21,440
Can you get, can you get?

224
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:22,960
Ah, see, I was going to propose a plan

225
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:24,800
and then I realized my own fatal flaw in the plan.

226
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:25,840
I'll propose the plan first.

227
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:27,760
Then I'll explain what the fatal flaw is.

228
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:30,560
The proposed plan that I wanted to put forward

229
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:32,800
is you have Dwayne the Rock Johnson in a scuba suit

230
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:35,040
underneath the boat, just holding on for dear life.

231
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:36,720
And then when you catch the fish and reel it up,

232
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:38,400
he lifts it into the boat for you.

233
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:39,760
But then he hides it.

234
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:41,440
Maybe he's wearing a ghillie suit.

235
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:43,120
The fatal flaw in that is there is no way

236
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:45,520
you're going to keep the Rock from just unhinging his jaw

237
00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:46,480
and eating that fish hole.

238
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:49,360
Cause he eats like fucking 12 pounds of cod every single day.

239
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:51,200
If he sees because he hates cod,

240
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:52,160
not because he's hungry.

241
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:55,760
Well, he loves, he loves getting boss fish lifters too.

242
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:58,080
He needs to maintain them.

243
00:11:58,080 --> 00:12:00,640
That's why Lady Gaga wouldn't wear her meat dress around him.

244
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:02,320
Who would just like, oh, pop it.

245
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:03,600
No red meat, no red meat.

246
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:05,360
Just that good cod.

247
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:07,680
Just that good cod?

248
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:07,920
Yeah.

249
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:10,320
What if, say he's unable to get those,

250
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:11,440
like for medical reasons,

251
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:13,440
he can't get diesel fish lifters.

252
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:15,840
I would say the alternate ending of this movie,

253
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:18,240
but isn't the ending of this movie always like,

254
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:19,120
you can't do it.

255
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:22,000
But then they get into some kind of scrape

256
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,320
and like they're unable to do something that like,

257
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:26,640
oh, Skinny Todd can fix the engine

258
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:28,480
cause he can slide through the ducks.

259
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:32,160
Like maybe like you can't, you can't lift the fish,

260
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:34,960
but then one of them needs help setting up a tumbler.

261
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:35,200
Yeah.

262
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:37,360
And you're like, here, no problem, allow me.

263
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:39,920
But let me help you post the pictures of your fish.

264
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:40,880
Click, click, click, click, click.

265
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:44,080
Skinny Todd, you did it.

266
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:44,720
But this movie-

267
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:45,920
Get back in the engine.

268
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:46,480
You realize-

269
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:48,480
Get back in the engine, Skinny Todd.

270
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:50,560
You realize this movie's gonna end

271
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:52,560
with Skinny Todd falling into the water

272
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:53,840
and everybody gets really worried,

273
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:56,400
but then he magically transforms into a fish.

274
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:58,480
The Skinny Todd Limpet.

275
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:00,480
And then they all learned to love fish

276
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:01,040
and they stop the fishing.

277
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:02,160
And miss Todd.

278
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:03,440
And they miss Todd very much.

279
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:05,040
Everybody misses Todd.

280
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:05,360
Very much.

281
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,280
He's a fish now.

282
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:09,520
He can't talk or think or anything.

283
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:10,320
He's a fucking fish.

284
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:11,040
He's a fish.

285
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:12,880
And then they catch him, but then they let him go

286
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:13,920
and it's very touching.

287
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:14,560
And they let him go.

288
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:17,680
And as they throw Todd back, fish Todd,

289
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:19,760
back into the water as he's flying through the air,

290
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:20,240
who's that?

291
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:23,200
Pops out of the water like fucking Jason

292
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:24,160
on hinges his jocks.

293
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:24,880
The Rockies.

294
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:25,760
Todd Hull.

295
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:26,480
And it's a horror.

296
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:27,760
It was a horror movie the whole time.

297
00:13:29,280 --> 00:13:30,480
Do you guys want a yahoo?

298
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:30,720
Yes, please.

299
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:31,520
Yeah, for sure.

300
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:33,280
Or did you want me to read this summary

301
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:34,960
of The Incredible Mr. Limpet?

302
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:35,280
Nah.

303
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:36,240
It's fucking crazy.

304
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:36,400
No, we did that-

305
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:37,680
What if people don't know?

306
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:39,440
Literally less than 10 episodes ago.

307
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:41,760
But what if they don't know, Griffin?

308
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:42,400
This one was sent in by-

309
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:43,440
Yeah, what if they miss that one?

310
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:45,920
This one was sent in by Dan Boduin.

311
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:51,360
And just based on how poorly I pronounce that,

312
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:53,920
it's not Bodin-well that I said it right.

313
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:55,680
Nice.

314
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:58,080
And it's by yahoo answers user Nutty.

315
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:00,240
I didn't really know how to pronounce that.

316
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:02,240
It's like Nutty, but there's extra T's and I's.

317
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:04,560
Anyway, Nutty asks,

318
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:08,160
extremely short tongue for kissing.

319
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:09,600
Wait.

320
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:13,280
I have very short tongue.

321
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:16,720
Let's say I'm sticking out my tongue straightly,

322
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:20,080
and its length is not even half an inch from the teeth

323
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:21,920
to the end of the tongue.

324
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:22,480
Jesus.

325
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:26,000
It's extremely short tongue.

326
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,120
They said it in the fucking title.

327
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:28,080
Why are you surprised?

328
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:31,440
But that just seems like he lost some in an accident.

329
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:33,120
It's like that's not even half an inch from the teeth

330
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:33,840
to the end of the tongue.

331
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:35,440
I am so serious about this.

332
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:38,240
And it makes me so sad whenever my girlfriend and I make out.

333
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:40,080
She does most of jobs,

334
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:43,520
and it is so hard for me to do my moves, you know.

335
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:46,640
Please need advice on technique, lol.

336
00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:47,440
Help, lol.

337
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:48,000
It's probably-

338
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:51,200
This dear heart, it's probably hard for them to say lol.

339
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:52,960
Yeah, I was gonna say, like,

340
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:56,400
your girlfriend's upset about you not being able to do your kiss moves,

341
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:59,040
but she's fine with the fact that you, like, can't say T.

342
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:01,600
Like, you can't say any T's or most letters.

343
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:05,600
What if he really just has a really deep mouth?

344
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:07,360
That is another-

345
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:12,000
His tongue is perfectly normal length, but inside it is cavernous.

346
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,600
Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby.

347
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:15,360
I have a lot of inner tongue,

348
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:17,920
and if you want to meet it, you're gonna need to go to the dentist.

349
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:19,200
You're gonna have to come to me.

350
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:22,720
Maybe his face looks like Alec Baldwin's in Beetlejuice,

351
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:25,680
when they do the stretch out beaky face.

352
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:26,240
All right.

353
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:27,760
Follow me here.

354
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:29,120
Stretch out beaky face.

355
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:29,680
All right.

356
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:31,040
All right.

357
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:34,800
Which would make it hard to do some kiss moves,

358
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:36,880
because your eyeballs are in there, if I remember correctly.

359
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:37,280
Sure.

360
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:41,760
See, what I like better is less you have an elongated beak-like mouth,

361
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:44,720
and more that you just have a regular head and mouth and everything,

362
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:46,880
but your tongue starts really far back.

363
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:48,400
Like way wicked back.

364
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:49,760
Like mid esophagus.

365
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:51,600
Yeah, like super duper back.

366
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:55,200
Here's like a pretty good question that nobody really wants to address.

367
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:55,520
Yeah.

368
00:15:55,520 --> 00:15:57,680
You know the tip of your tongue, right?

369
00:15:57,680 --> 00:15:58,000
Yeah.

370
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:00,240
What is the other end?

371
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:02,240
Lots of people know the tip of my tongue, if you know what I'm saying.

372
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:03,520
Yeah, sweet.

373
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:04,960
Like in a job interview setting?

374
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:07,360
What's the other end connected to?

375
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:09,600
Your feet.

376
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:12,640
No, I mean like it runs all the way down.

377
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:14,400
Like envision your tongue, right?

378
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:18,080
Like it's going, imagine you're going on a ride down the back of your throat, right?

379
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:19,280
You're on your tongue.

380
00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:21,680
Oh God, oh fuck, oh God.

381
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:23,040
Slow the fuck down, Justin.

382
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:29,120
You get past the uvula, and then you're just like, what?

383
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:31,120
What's going on at the back of your tongue?

384
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:32,000
Yeah, where's the start?

385
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,480
What if it's not connected, but if you think about it too hard,

386
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:35,680
your tongue falls out.

387
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:37,120
He just choked to death right there.

388
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:38,560
Right there in your tongue.

389
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:41,280
Oh fuck, this is the most excited this podcast has ever made me.

390
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:42,960
Oh great.

391
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:43,440
Oh no.

392
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:45,520
Uh, here's another question.

393
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:47,840
I received a Bob Ross painting kit.

394
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:50,240
Wait, you just get, you're giving up on short tongue?

395
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:51,920
We were afraid of your erection.

396
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:55,840
I feel like, yeah, actually, Travis, thank you for putting a point on it.

397
00:16:55,840 --> 00:16:56,960
That's exactly what happened.

398
00:16:57,520 --> 00:16:59,200
We don't do enough questions on this show anymore.

399
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:02,080
My whole thing for 2016 is like, let's do more questions.

400
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:03,120
Okay, well that's fine.

401
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:04,880
It's just like the happiest of questions made me in a long time,

402
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:07,280
but let's just blow, kind of lean over it.

403
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:11,040
Listen to this part at 1.5 speed.

404
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:13,440
That was a premium swallow, though.

405
00:17:16,080 --> 00:17:18,000
I received a Bob Ross painting kit for Christmas,

406
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,120
and I've done some paintings.

407
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:22,960
I would love, by the way, if you're looking for a considerate gift to get me,

408
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:24,080
P.O. Box 54.

409
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:29,280
Bob Ross painting kit, as long as it comes with all the required accoutrement.

410
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:30,960
What a tasteful-

411
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:31,600
Paint by numbers?

412
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:32,960
I guess, yes.

413
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:34,880
Or just like an instructional video.

414
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:38,080
I like them, and I want to hang them, but is that a little arrogant?

415
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:45,440
What is acceptable to hang your own mediocre paintings?

416
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:48,240
That's from Artistically Acute in Arkansas.

417
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:51,280
If you do this, you have to have permanently attached to your hand

418
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:56,080
a glass filled with red wine all the time so you can gesture to your art.

419
00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:58,800
Yeah, that shit, that shit was me.

420
00:17:58,800 --> 00:18:02,240
What you're seeing right there is how I see the world beautifully.

421
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:03,600
That's my mountain.

422
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:04,960
That's my mountain.

423
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:05,760
I made it.

424
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:07,920
That is my mountain wife.

425
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:13,120
I took all of my experiences throughout my life and the emotions I was feeling that day,

426
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:15,040
and I committed them to canvas.

427
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:23,120
I don't know, like, it kind of depends on how the painting was brought, right?

428
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:26,240
Like if you follow along the video, I think that's fine.

429
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:30,240
If you were filling in the parts that he told you to fill,

430
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:33,440
like if it was like Travis said, a paint by numbers or what have you,

431
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:35,680
like that gets a little dicier for me.

432
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:39,040
I feel like that is not something you necessarily need to display.

433
00:18:39,040 --> 00:18:40,960
Unless you pitch it as a, oh, this one?

434
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:43,040
This is a me and Bob collab-o.

435
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:45,680
I collaborated on this artistic-

436
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:47,920
That's a Bob Steve original.

437
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:48,240
Yeah.

438
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:51,840
Oh, we'll see you eyeballing my art.

439
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:57,120
He told me to use periwinkle here, and I went with azure.

440
00:18:58,160 --> 00:18:58,800
Went with what?

441
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:00,240
Azure.

442
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:02,240
All right.

443
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:03,040
You added like three syllables.

444
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:03,840
The color, the color azure?

445
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:06,720
Yeah, I think it's azure, not azure.

446
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:08,480
Azure, I think, is the color.

447
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:12,080
I'm like 900% sure you'd be in a ding-dong right now.

448
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:13,760
I believe it's azuree.

449
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:14,880
I think it's azure.

450
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:18,800
Does your opinion change on this question,

451
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:23,120
depending on the quality of the finished product?

452
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:25,280
Azure, azure.

453
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:26,960
Yeah, that's right, motherfucker.

454
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:28,960
Azure, azure.

455
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:32,080
Okay, so just to be clear, in case you've been listening for a long time,

456
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:34,880
Griffin is now siding with a robot over his breath.

457
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:35,680
Okay, come on.

458
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:38,800
The robot's siding with me, if anything.

459
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:42,560
Azure, azure, azure.

460
00:19:42,560 --> 00:19:44,000
Now make it say dirty words.

461
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,480
Hey, can you make it say, like, make it say butthole?

462
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,040
I don't think, I don't think-

463
00:19:49,040 --> 00:19:50,160
Make it say butthole.

464
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:51,760
Justin, make it say butthole.

465
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:57,200
Butthole, butthole.

466
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:58,320
Yay!

467
00:19:58,320 --> 00:19:59,680
Are you doing it as two different words?

468
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:02,240
Yeah, it doesn't have butthole together.

469
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:03,040
Hey, check this out.

470
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:05,440
That's pretty good.

471
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:06,560
I found one.

472
00:20:06,560 --> 00:20:07,040
I found one.

473
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:07,440
Can I try?

474
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:08,240
Yeah.

475
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:09,860
Butthole.

476
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:11,840
That's how they think butthole does.

477
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:14,320
Butthole.

478
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:15,120
Any more?

479
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:15,920
Penis.

480
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:16,240
Fuck.

481
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:21,920
Penis, penis, penis, penis, penis, penis, penis, penis.

482
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:23,200
This is top notch.

483
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:24,560
This is good jokes right here.

484
00:20:24,560 --> 00:20:27,440
This is gonna be our first charged for episode.

485
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:29,440
For pay.

486
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:32,960
Griffin's gonna be editing this and he's gonna be like, it's 30 minutes long.

487
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:35,840
I had to cut the 20 minutes where they let robots say words.

488
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:36,720
What was I thinking?

489
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:38,720
Why did I encourage that?

490
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:40,800
Hey, listen, I got one coming in hot.

491
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:41,520
Hold on.

492
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:42,080
Premium.

493
00:20:43,040 --> 00:20:43,540
Fuck.

494
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:44,960
Boy.

495
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:45,460
Yay!

496
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:52,560
I asked, I actually asked it to say Justin McElroy and that's what it came out with.

497
00:20:52,560 --> 00:20:53,200
That's weird.

498
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:56,720
I hope that this is a lot of people's first episodes.

499
00:20:58,320 --> 00:21:00,000
Wait, hold on, wait, here's one.

500
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:04,240
Hello, my name is Derek and I am a premium fuck boy.

501
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:08,960
Hello, Derek.

502
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:10,880
Would anyone like some penis tricks?

503
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:12,240
Some what?

504
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:15,360
Would anyone like some what?

505
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:16,320
Penis tricks.

506
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:17,120
What are those?

507
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:19,600
Tricks you do with your dinger.

508
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:21,200
Oh, let's get back on the fucking saddle.

509
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:24,080
What were we even doing or talking about?

510
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:25,040
Bob Ross.

511
00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:28,000
I think it's a bad taste.

512
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,040
I don't think you can do it.

513
00:21:29,040 --> 00:21:32,320
I don't make fucking episodes of this podcast my ringtone.

514
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:33,280
You know what I mean?

515
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:34,000
Oh, I do.

516
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:37,040
I play on my podcast for people and I watch them enjoy it.

517
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:40,640
And then I shush them if they try to talk during it.

518
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:43,760
Then where do you land on the mounting your own paintings?

519
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:47,600
I think you have to do it, but in a special room that you invite people and they're like,

520
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:48,640
oh, are you having a good time?

521
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:50,400
Thank you for joining me in my home this evening.

522
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:53,520
Can I show you what I'm really proud of?

523
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:57,760
And then you throw open the door and it's floor to ceiling your own Bob Rossian paintings.

524
00:21:57,760 --> 00:21:59,600
And you refer to them as your children.

525
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:02,880
I want to ask you a question, Travis.

526
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:03,520
Yes?

527
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:06,320
Because I know you're not joking about making people listen to your podcast.

528
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:08,960
Especially like really funny parts.

529
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:13,760
And I have done the same thing with people who like ask you like, what's a podcast or

530
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:14,960
what's your show like?

531
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:16,080
So here's my question to you.

532
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:21,760
When you're forcing someone to listen to a podcast you made, what do you think the

533
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:25,200
appropriate thing is to do with your eyes?

534
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:27,360
Both your eyes and their eyes.

535
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:31,440
Where should everybody be looking for the four minutes that you are listening to your

536
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:32,240
own podcast?

537
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:35,600
Because I'll be damned if I can come like you're not looking at the screen.

538
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:36,880
There's nothing there.

539
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:40,880
So do you keep eye contact with the person and just sort of like nod slowly?

540
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:44,560
My go to is to look off in the middle distance.

541
00:22:44,560 --> 00:22:50,560
But kind of like squint a little bit like I'm trying to remember a childhood friend's

542
00:22:50,560 --> 00:22:51,040
name.

543
00:22:51,040 --> 00:22:55,840
Like you're watching a movie based on the things that you're saying somewhere in another

544
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:56,640
room.

545
00:22:56,640 --> 00:23:02,560
It's like I'm waiting for like some kind of clue or to drop where they'll be like,

546
00:23:02,560 --> 00:23:03,600
oh, yeah.

547
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:04,960
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

548
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:05,920
I love this.

549
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:08,880
That's what I'm waiting for anybody I'm with to see.

550
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:10,160
I'm waiting for them to say that.

551
00:23:10,160 --> 00:23:15,840
I think it is bogus that you're trying to justify making other people listen to your

552
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:22,240
show with you in the room based on like informational its informational value when like if you're

553
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:26,160
a chef and you're like, oh, I make pie for a living and somebody's like, I don't know

554
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:26,720
what's a pie.

555
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:27,440
I don't know what pie is.

556
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:31,280
You don't have to be like, well, I guess I have to cook a pie now because I'm a genie

557
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:32,960
and you said my code word.

558
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:36,640
Would there be a human being alive, Griffin, that if you sat them down and said, watch

559
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:42,080
me, I'm a professional pie maker, watch me make this pie for you, that they'd be like,

560
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:43,360
oh, God, I hate those.

561
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:46,080
Well, no, because pies add something to society.

562
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:48,320
While podcasts, I would say, if anything, detract.

563
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:49,200
Detract, yeah.

564
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:53,360
It's also helpful sometimes like if you're getting near a really funny part and you know

565
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:55,680
you're about to say a super funny joke.

566
00:23:55,680 --> 00:23:56,160
Oh, here it comes.

567
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:56,880
Oh, and they talk.

568
00:23:56,880 --> 00:24:00,400
You just stare at the person and if they start to say something like, no, just listen, listen,

569
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:01,200
listen.

570
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:02,080
Oh, let me run it back.

571
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:02,560
You missed.

572
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:03,200
OK, hold on.

573
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:09,040
What's weird, Travis, is that you, in real life, because right now this is the digi world,

574
00:24:09,040 --> 00:24:12,560
now that people are downloading and listening to this, they are in this podcast, Us Talking

575
00:24:12,560 --> 00:24:13,760
is now in the digi world.

576
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:18,160
In real life, you just did this to one of your friends with that text-to-speech part

577
00:24:18,160 --> 00:24:18,880
that just happened.

578
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:19,360
And you're like, oh, fuck, fuck.

579
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:23,200
And when you said one of my friends, you mean my wife, which is the only person that will

580
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:24,080
hang out with me anymore.

581
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:26,880
Yo, T-Bird, this shit is about to get sick.

582
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:29,120
They make a robot talk about penis tricks.

583
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:29,920
You're going to love it.

584
00:24:29,920 --> 00:24:30,960
Please don't interrupt.

585
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:33,120
Please, please keep it down.

586
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:36,320
I know you've had a cough, oddly, if you could try and curtail it just a little bit while

587
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:38,560
the robot says penis tricks.

588
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:43,200
It's also important to note, if the person talks, you pause it and sigh heavily and then

589
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:45,200
turn to them and say, I'm sorry, what?

590
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:46,880
What was it?

591
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:48,560
This is my art, but I guess that's...

592
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:54,560
I just thought about hanging a painting that I made up and it made...

593
00:24:54,560 --> 00:24:56,080
Well, OK, here's the thing, actually.

594
00:24:56,080 --> 00:25:01,840
There's this website called Canvas On Demand, and they do these insane canvas print deals

595
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:05,040
all the time for photos, and Rachel and I have done it.

596
00:25:05,040 --> 00:25:11,120
I think we have three of these nice canvas things that are based on pictures that I've

597
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:15,600
taken, like some from our honeymoon in Japan and one from our trip to Hong Kong, and we

598
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:17,520
actually do have those hanging up in the house.

599
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:18,560
Same principle?

600
00:25:18,560 --> 00:25:20,400
Sounds pretty boring to me.

601
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:20,880
OK.

602
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:22,720
I'm sorry, Julie.

603
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:24,320
I don't know why she said that.

604
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:28,480
Honest advice time, you can do it, but you just can't be...

605
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:30,320
Because you can be proud of a thing you make.

606
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:31,040
There's nothing wrong with that.

607
00:25:31,040 --> 00:25:31,840
Well, I don't fucking...

608
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:35,200
When people come into the house, I'm not just standing by my canvas.

609
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:37,840
What if the photo is a tasteful nude?

610
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:38,640
Like myself?

611
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:39,200
Uh-huh.

612
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:41,200
Or someone else?

613
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:43,040
No, like yourself and you hang it like over the back of your chair.

614
00:25:43,040 --> 00:25:44,000
Justin, you've been quiet for a while.

615
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,040
Are you making that robot say shit?

616
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:47,680
No, I am not.

617
00:25:47,680 --> 00:25:50,880
I was thinking about whether or not I would have the guts to display a painting of my

618
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:51,520
own.

619
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:52,000
Yeah.

620
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:56,560
Well, can you do me a favor and as you're thinking about it, just save your feelings

621
00:25:56,560 --> 00:25:57,520
like as you're thinking them?

622
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:02,560
I think art and craft are really two separate things, aren't they?

623
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:04,400
Damn, that's good.

624
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:08,240
Well, this is what happens if we let Justin be quiet for a couple of minutes.

625
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:10,400
He thinks up some really dope shit to say.

626
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:11,840
Like, think about that for a second.

627
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:14,080
There's a difference between art and craft, and I don't think...

628
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:17,920
I think that by displaying art, you're saying...

629
00:26:17,920 --> 00:26:19,520
You're making a statement.

630
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:22,400
You're making a statement by displaying craft.

631
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:23,120
You're bragging.

632
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:25,120
And that's where it separates from me.

633
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:30,640
It's like when you make a piece of art that comes from some creative place in your soul

634
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:33,440
and then you put it on display, you're saying like, this is an important thought to me.

635
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:34,800
This is an important concept.

636
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:36,240
What's the delineation there for painting?

637
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:37,760
Because then you could actually get...

638
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:38,720
Because you're not...

639
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:43,920
If you're doing something that Bob Ross told you to do, I don't classify that as a work

640
00:26:43,920 --> 00:26:47,280
of art because it's about the craft of how you reenact it.

641
00:26:47,280 --> 00:26:50,480
Now, if you... What if Bob Ross did something that you told him to do?

642
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:54,720
Is this a genuine Bob Ross?

643
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:55,440
Yeah, it's a...

644
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:56,400
You like that shit?

645
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:59,440
I was like, yo, Bob, my boy, do a snowy caldera.

646
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:01,200
And he was like, you got it, and he did it.

647
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:04,000
And he was like, hey, man, I just put paint to canvas.

648
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:05,840
You're the fucking mind behind this thing.

649
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:06,960
That would be a collabo.

650
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:08,000
That's a really good point, actually.

651
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,280
That's a sick collabo.

652
00:27:09,280 --> 00:27:10,480
See, that's what we need to do.

653
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:15,680
We need to start up a fucking art studio for people who cannot paint.

654
00:27:15,680 --> 00:27:20,560
But we will have painters come in and do just contract work.

655
00:27:20,560 --> 00:27:28,800
Just do me up one of Homer Simpson, but he's pissing on the Ford logo.

656
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:30,960
And this really good artist is like, you got it.

657
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:35,040
And then they craft this painting to your specifications, but it's your art.

658
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:35,760
It's your art.

659
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:37,520
You did the art.

660
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:38,880
And then you put your name on it.

661
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:39,200
Yeah.

662
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:43,600
The greatest tragedy in the world is that Bob Ross died before I could make him paint

663
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:46,000
Bart Simpson peeing on a Ford logo.

664
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:46,640
Homer Simpson.

665
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:47,680
Calvin.

666
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:52,880
Well, it's Bart Simpson peeing on Homer Simpson who's peeing on Calvin who's peeing on the

667
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:54,160
Ford logo all the way down.

668
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:56,080
It's like a fountain.

669
00:27:56,080 --> 00:27:57,440
Hey, guys, listen.

670
00:27:57,440 --> 00:27:58,960
We've talked for long enough.

671
00:27:59,680 --> 00:28:02,960
Let's go to the Money's Own New Choice Bits of Beefsteak.

672
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:03,760
Okay.

673
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:05,200
That's my assistant, Richard.

674
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:10,000
You need to have an HR discussion with her.

675
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,400
I feel very uncomfortable in the workplace.

676
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:14,160
Yeah, it seems really-

677
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:16,080
I'm sorry, were you podcasting?

678
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:18,800
Yes, Bridget, I told you I was.

679
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:20,240
Please get out of my office.

680
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:21,280
Hey there, Bridget.

681
00:28:21,280 --> 00:28:23,280
What a smooth and sexy voice you have.

682
00:28:25,040 --> 00:28:26,560
Bridget, baby, are you still there?

683
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:31,200
Talk to me, stud rocket.

684
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:34,640
ASL.

685
00:28:39,920 --> 00:28:40,640
Should I leave?

686
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:41,140
Yes.

687
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:48,000
It's about to get strange.

688
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,200
All right, let's go to the Money's Own.

689
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:50,320
No.

690
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:50,820
Okay.

691
00:28:53,680 --> 00:28:54,160
I'm almost finished.

692
00:28:54,160 --> 00:28:55,120
He's become sentient.

693
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:56,400
I'm almost finished.

694
00:28:56,400 --> 00:28:57,600
I'm almost finished.

695
00:28:57,600 --> 00:28:58,880
I'm almost finished.

696
00:28:58,880 --> 00:28:59,840
I'm almost finished.

697
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:02,560
Here we go.

698
00:29:05,280 --> 00:29:06,720
Oh, oh, oh.

699
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:08,800
Oh, damn.

700
00:29:11,680 --> 00:29:13,200
I done flooded my basement.

701
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:17,520
I done flooded my basement?

702
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:18,160
What?

703
00:29:18,160 --> 00:29:19,120
I had an O.

704
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:39,920
Guys, listen, it's time to get serious, okay?

705
00:29:39,920 --> 00:29:40,800

713
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:14,800
I used Squarespace to start up my Shrek porn site.

714
00:30:14,800 --> 00:30:19,920
Man, I really don't understand computers.

715
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:21,200
I don't either.

716
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:22,560
What are they into these days?

717
00:30:23,280 --> 00:30:25,760

723
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:44,000
Thank you for putting Griffin's and me both corner on there.

724
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:44,720
You're welcome.

725
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:45,600
I appreciate it.

726
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:47,680
Let me tell you about Bowling Branch.

727
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:49,520
Use your human, use your meat voice.

728
00:30:50,160 --> 00:30:54,320
I have been, it is a luxurious place for bedding.

729
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:55,920
Well, it's a place for luxurious bedding.

730
00:30:55,920 --> 00:30:57,680
I don't know if it's probably a warehouse.

731
00:30:57,680 --> 00:31:02,320
You mean bedding like mad, like sleep bedding, not like bedding on the ponies.

732
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:04,160
Yeah, bet on the luxurious ponies.

733
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:06,960
Bowling Branch, the sleeping ponies.

734
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:09,040
Now there, it's the sheets are fantastic.

735
00:31:09,040 --> 00:31:11,120
I mean, like, I don't know what else to say other than I was,

736
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:15,840
I've like bought lots of sheets trying to find something that feels like they do

737
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:18,400
when you get into them at a hotel and they're all cool and smooth.

738
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:21,200
And Bowling Branch like does it and it's fantastic.

739
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:26,640
And they're, they're luxurious sheets for a couple hundred bucks.

740
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:29,920
Like we've been sleeping on our Bowling Branch sheets for the last couple of weeks.

741
00:31:29,920 --> 00:31:30,880
They're great, right?

742
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:33,200
It's, they just keep getting more comfortable.

743
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:36,000
Like it's like breaking in a great pair of shoes.

744
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:40,320
And you know what they do is they get quality, quality cotton.

745
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:42,800
They don't worry about thread count because thread count is a myth.

746
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:43,680
That's not a thing.

747
00:31:43,680 --> 00:31:47,200
It doesn't actually affect how soft and comfortable the sheets are.

748
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:50,720
That's the quality of the cotton and they get really, really good cotton.

749
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:53,280
And they don't just have sheets, they got towels, they've got blankets,

750
00:31:53,280 --> 00:31:57,360
they've got duvet covers, everything you need to live a comfortable life.

751
00:31:57,360 --> 00:32:02,720
Go online, go to bowl and that's B-O-L-L and branch.com today.

754
00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:11,040
It's sick.

755
00:32:11,040 --> 00:32:12,640
I got a message for Mitch.

756
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:13,600
This one's from David.

757
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:16,560
If you want to get a message on the show, just go to maximumfun.org.jumbotron.

758
00:32:16,560 --> 00:32:17,360
It's really easy.

759
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:19,120
This message is for Mitch though.

760
00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:20,560
And it's from David.

761
00:32:20,560 --> 00:32:24,320
David says, dear Mitch, happy late, late, late birthday.

762
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:26,240
Thank you for being there and putting up with me.

763
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:27,600
You're the best girlfriend ever.

764
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:32,720
And although, and it says I have to read this in my wizard swear's voice from episode 251.

765
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:35,440
This ladder goes in six directions.

766
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,640
It always ends up pointing at your heart.

767
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:40,480
All my love, Dave's.

768
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:41,360
Perfect.

769
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:41,920
Griffin?

770
00:32:41,920 --> 00:32:43,360
I don't remember if I did that right or not.

771
00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:44,720
No, I think you nailed it.

772
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:45,760
You nailed it.

773
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:46,880
Can I read this next one?

774
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:47,360
Yeah, sure.

775
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:48,880
Yeah, because I love it.

776
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,880
This message is for Ryan Brent.

777
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:54,880
And his message is from Ed Bury.

778
00:32:55,680 --> 00:33:02,160
And Ed Bury says anything that includes happy birthday and for real, real, not for play, play.

779
00:33:02,160 --> 00:33:05,680
So a lot of like lenience there.

780
00:33:05,680 --> 00:33:07,280
Yeah, whatever you guys want to do.

781
00:33:07,280 --> 00:33:09,120
Listen, I'm not the creative one here.

782
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:13,520
Ed Bury understands that he doesn't have a podcast.

783
00:33:13,520 --> 00:33:15,280
He's not the one people are tuning in.

784
00:33:15,280 --> 00:33:19,200
He wants us to do a little bit of that voodoo that we do.

785
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:23,040
So I could do a whole fucking diatribe about how when I was a little kid,

786
00:33:23,040 --> 00:33:26,400
I thought that the lady dragon from Shrek was really sexy.

787
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:27,360
But then it's somewhere in there.

788
00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:30,240
As long as they say happy birthday for real, real, not for play, play,

789
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:33,280
then it would have satisfied this person's demands,

790
00:33:33,280 --> 00:33:37,760
much like that lady dragon satisfied my confused teenage demands.

791
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:44,960
I enjoy the conceit that like your attraction to the lady dragon from Shrek is like

792
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:47,360
something we wouldn't normally hit on the show.

793
00:33:48,560 --> 00:33:52,800
My Brother, My Brother and Me is really a forum for a discussion like that.

794
00:33:52,800 --> 00:33:53,920
Not for those sorts of ideas.

795
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:56,880
Thankfully, Ed Bury opened that door and said,

796
00:33:56,880 --> 00:34:01,040
Griffin, the next five minutes is all yours off the clock, free of charge.

797
00:34:01,040 --> 00:34:06,080
I've been waiting for a fucking wild card opportunity like this for years,

798
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:07,840
and you guys have just never left the door open.

799
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:09,680
Yes, the scales are nice.

800
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:14,480
Thank you to Mitch and David for giving us a little bit more boundaries

801
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:17,200
so I don't have to hear about Griffin's.

802
00:34:17,200 --> 00:34:19,840
Oh, this is a mistake that nobody else is ever going to make.

803
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:22,560
Yeah, you've made the mistake here.

804
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:24,640
Now we all have to live in this mess.

805
00:34:24,640 --> 00:34:29,360
It's she's just very big and I think could swallow me probably pretty easily.

806
00:34:30,720 --> 00:34:32,000
Hi, I'm Sydney McElroy.

807
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:33,280
And I'm Riley Smyrl.

808
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:36,000
And we co-host a podcast called Still Buffering,

809
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,480
a sister's guide to teens through the 80s.

810
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:43,920
On our show, we tackle all of the hot teen topics that kids have on their minds today.

811
00:34:43,920 --> 00:34:45,680
Hot teen topics?

812
00:34:45,680 --> 00:34:49,760
Well, you know, the questions that are that are plaguing teenagers

813
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:52,480
through their tumultuous growing years.

814
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:54,880
Questions like, how do I party?

815
00:34:54,880 --> 00:34:57,760
Or what do I do with all this hair everywhere?

816
00:34:57,760 --> 00:35:02,480
The same questions that people like Sydney had during their years as teenagers.

817
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:04,720
Many, many, many.

818
00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:05,680
Okay, not that many.

819
00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:07,520
So, so long ago.

820
00:35:07,520 --> 00:35:09,120
Yeah, okay, I think they get the idea.

821
00:35:09,120 --> 00:35:13,280
So search for Still Buffering on iTunes or MaximumFun.org

822
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:15,440
for new episodes every Tuesday.

823
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:16,480
Still Buffering.

824
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:17,600
I am a teenager.

825
00:35:17,600 --> 00:35:24,640
And I was too.

826
00:35:24,640 --> 00:35:25,120
Do you guys want a yahoo?

827
00:35:25,120 --> 00:35:26,000
Hard drive's filling up.

828
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:27,200
So we need another yahoo.

829
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:31,600
Yeah, this yahoo was sent in by Morgan Davey.

830
00:35:31,600 --> 00:35:32,240
Thank you, Morgan.

831
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:34,880
It's by an anonymous yahoo user.

832
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:36,240
Ooh.

833
00:35:36,240 --> 00:35:36,560
Okay.

834
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:39,600
Who could it be?

835
00:35:39,600 --> 00:35:40,960
Could it be the president?

836
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:43,360
Could it be, I don't know, somebody else?

837
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:45,600
I ran out of people after the president.

838
00:35:45,600 --> 00:35:48,720
Quick update, snow is still falling at just an alarming rate.

839
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:49,920
Just really bad.

840
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:50,480
Really bad.

841
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:55,840
This anonymous user, let's call him, let's just call him who they are.

842
00:35:57,440 --> 00:35:57,840
Craig.

843
00:35:59,120 --> 00:36:00,320
T. Nelson from Coach.

844
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:00,880
T. Nelson.

845
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:04,000
Sorry that your revival of Coach didn't work out, Craig.

846
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:06,960
Craig, Mr. T. Nelson asks,

847
00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:12,480
is being popular in high school a good skill I can use in a job interview?

848
00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:13,600
Oh, yeah.

849
00:36:13,600 --> 00:36:16,880
Like, one of my best skills was being popular in high school.

850
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:19,280
Everyone loved being around me and wanted my attention,

851
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:22,640
so I think I do great in sales in that regard.

852
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:24,880
Also, I coached the big team.

853
00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:27,920
The big, the big, was it football?

854
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:30,720
Uh, excuse me, I'm going over your resume here.

855
00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:33,280
It says you coached the big team.

856
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:34,080
That can't be right.

857
00:36:34,080 --> 00:36:34,560
What, did he do-

858
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:37,360
It says here you were a super cool dude?

859
00:36:37,360 --> 00:36:39,520
Did he do football or basketball in the television show, Coach?

860
00:36:39,520 --> 00:36:40,480
Are you talking about Coach?

861
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:40,720
Yeah.

862
00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:42,960
I believe he did the football.

863
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:45,840
Him and Goonther?

864
00:36:45,840 --> 00:36:46,880
That's not his name, is it?

865
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:47,520
That's from friends.

866
00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:48,400
We'll probably never know.

867
00:36:50,240 --> 00:36:54,080
Can you be like, I was well liked, so you need me.

868
00:36:54,080 --> 00:36:56,640
I do great in sales in that regard.

869
00:36:57,360 --> 00:37:00,160
I dated all the cheerleaders.

870
00:37:00,160 --> 00:37:01,280
And also was them.

871
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:03,360
Please let me sell your cars.

872
00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:07,040
I was in a horrific lab accident in high school,

873
00:37:07,040 --> 00:37:09,840
and I became all of the students all at once.

874
00:37:09,840 --> 00:37:12,720
I sort of lost my physical tangible form,

875
00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:14,400
and became sort of just like a nightmare

876
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:15,520
they all had every night.

877
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:18,400
But it made me, it did make me very popular.

878
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:21,280
I was, you could say I was literally on their minds.

879
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:21,760
Like-

880
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:24,800
I was kind of a hive mind in high school.

881
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:26,880
I was on the speech and debate team,

882
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:28,480
and the football team, and tennis,

883
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:30,720
and I was a lunch lady and a janitor.

884
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:34,480
I was Jared from The Pretender when I was in high school,

885
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:37,840
and I did every job and was every student.

886
00:37:37,840 --> 00:37:40,080
And everybody liked me and was in love with me,

887
00:37:40,080 --> 00:37:41,600
and some thought I was a woman,

888
00:37:41,600 --> 00:37:43,200
and a few thought I was a trash can,

889
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:44,960
because I was very good at pretending to be a trash can.

890
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:47,680
I was very good, very convincing.

891
00:37:47,680 --> 00:37:50,880
I was this underground lake of shape-shifting slime

892
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:54,160
that was below the school,

893
00:37:54,160 --> 00:37:55,920
and at night I would come back

894
00:37:55,920 --> 00:37:57,600
and just sort of repopulate the school,

895
00:37:57,600 --> 00:37:59,600
filling up all of the positions.

896
00:37:59,600 --> 00:38:01,520
Let me show you this yearbook real quick.

897
00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:04,320
That's me, that's me, if you wouldn't know it, that's me.

898
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:06,800
And the yearbook, the yearbook is made of slime,

899
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:08,160
and is also part of me.

900
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:10,000
Anyway, I think I would do great in cells.

901
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:12,560
Can I sells your cars, please?

902
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:14,560
Let me ask you this.

903
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:18,320
Can you try this strategy in a job interview

904
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:20,800
if you're a hyper-permissive parent

905
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:24,400
that let high school kids have parties at your house?

906
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:27,360
Like, listen, let's just, let me just put it this way.

907
00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:30,480
I know a few teens.

908
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:34,160
I know where they hang out, and it's my house.

909
00:38:34,160 --> 00:38:38,080
I'm pretty plugged in to what teenagers are into.

910
00:38:38,080 --> 00:38:39,680
If you're, oh my God.

911
00:38:39,680 --> 00:38:40,720
Oh my God.

912
00:38:40,720 --> 00:38:43,680
If you had hyper-permissive parents in high school,

913
00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:45,200
if you ever went to somebody's party where it's like,

914
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:47,360
I don't know, yeah, Dylan's parents

915
00:38:47,360 --> 00:38:50,880
let us have cool, crazy parties at our house constantly.

916
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:55,360
What if their parents were market researchers?

917
00:38:55,360 --> 00:38:56,800
Like, when you went to the party,

918
00:38:56,800 --> 00:38:58,720
did you ever see like new gadgets

919
00:38:58,720 --> 00:39:00,480
or perhaps a new formulation of breakfast cereal?

920
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:02,160
Did you have to sign an NDA?

921
00:39:02,160 --> 00:39:04,320
Like, were the boxes unlabeled

922
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:06,720
and they just had like A, B, and C written on them?

923
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:07,360
What the fuck?

924
00:39:07,360 --> 00:39:09,520
This Coca-Cola tastes like vanilla.

925
00:39:09,520 --> 00:39:10,320
Yeah, that's strange.

926
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:12,240
But what did you think about the vanilla Coca-Cola?

927
00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:13,200
Would you tell a friend about it?

928
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:14,560
Would you tell 10 friends about it?

929
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:15,200
Would it trend?

930
00:39:16,560 --> 00:39:16,880
Bryce?

931
00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:18,240
Can you fill this form out, please?

932
00:39:18,240 --> 00:39:19,120
Have a great time.

933
00:39:19,120 --> 00:39:22,560
Hi, I'm not Dylan's dad, Bri-boy.

934
00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:24,960
Bri-bri.

935
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:25,520
Bri-bri.

936
00:39:25,520 --> 00:39:26,080
I'm Bri-bri.

937
00:39:26,080 --> 00:39:26,880
I'm not Dylan's dad.

938
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:27,840
That's the important thing.

939
00:39:29,360 --> 00:39:31,520
What do you think of the music we're listening to right now?

940
00:39:31,520 --> 00:39:33,520
Is this-

941
00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:34,080
How does this-

942
00:39:34,080 --> 00:39:34,880
Does this make you-

943
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:36,160
If you were listening to this in a store,

944
00:39:36,160 --> 00:39:38,960
would it make you very compelled to buy something?

945
00:39:39,680 --> 00:39:40,800
Compelled to buy something?

946
00:39:41,520 --> 00:39:42,560
So-so?

947
00:39:42,560 --> 00:39:43,760
Not compelled to buy something?

948
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:45,680
Or very not compelled to buy something?

949
00:39:45,680 --> 00:39:47,760
Man, these red walls are pretty cool, huh?

950
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:49,280
What do you think of this color?

951
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:50,800
Do you think that this color is intriguing?

952
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:51,840
How does it make you feel?

953
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:55,360
Make you feel warm or scared?

954
00:39:55,360 --> 00:39:57,040
How long has the pepper spray

955
00:39:57,040 --> 00:39:58,880
that I sprayed in your eyes been burning?

956
00:39:58,880 --> 00:40:00,800
And how much longer do you think it would be burning?

957
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:01,440
Would this-

958
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:02,640
I'll let you out of here

959
00:40:02,640 --> 00:40:04,640
as soon as you tell me what I want to know.

960
00:40:05,840 --> 00:40:07,360
Can you escape from the handcuffs?

961
00:40:07,360 --> 00:40:08,080
Are they too tight?

962
00:40:08,080 --> 00:40:09,120
Not tight enough.

963
00:40:09,120 --> 00:40:15,360
I'd like you to meet my friend, Teddy Cruz.

964
00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:16,560
We can just keep his last name Cruz

965
00:40:16,560 --> 00:40:17,840
because it sounds like cool.

966
00:40:17,840 --> 00:40:19,520
This is my friend, Teddy Cruz.

967
00:40:19,520 --> 00:40:20,400
Hey, what's up?

968
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:21,280
Do I seem affable?

969
00:40:21,280 --> 00:40:22,960
Would you want to get a drink with me?

970
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:24,080
The only way that this works

971
00:40:24,080 --> 00:40:25,920
is if you roll into the job interview

972
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:30,480
and do like a sweet kick flip on your skateboard, I guess.

973
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:32,960
I think everybody's on those rolly boards now.

974
00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:34,320
Okay, you roll in on your rolly boards.

975
00:40:34,320 --> 00:40:35,440
What's a rolly board?

976
00:40:35,440 --> 00:40:36,560
You know a rolly board.

977
00:40:36,560 --> 00:40:37,360
Like the hover.

978
00:40:37,360 --> 00:40:38,240
They're not hover boards,

979
00:40:38,240 --> 00:40:39,120
but everybody calls them that

980
00:40:39,120 --> 00:40:40,640
even though they're not that for sure.

981
00:40:40,640 --> 00:40:41,920
By definition, not that.

982
00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:43,600
But then you roll in, you do a kick flip,

983
00:40:43,600 --> 00:40:46,320
it explodes underneath you and you get the job.

984
00:40:46,320 --> 00:40:47,840
I would give that person a job instantly.

985
00:40:47,840 --> 00:40:48,400
Are you kidding me?

986
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:49,440
That'd be the fucking sweetest thing

987
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:50,320
I've ever seen in my life.

988
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:51,920
What if the person-

989
00:40:51,920 --> 00:40:52,640
Okay, this is-

990
00:40:52,640 --> 00:40:54,720
I was going to just claim this idea as my own,

991
00:40:54,720 --> 00:40:58,160
but a game recognized game, Rachel Rosen.

992
00:40:58,160 --> 00:41:03,840
This one is Yahoo Answers user bisexual response.

993
00:41:03,840 --> 00:41:06,000
Really just putting a fine point on it.

994
00:41:06,720 --> 00:41:07,680
Bisexual says,

995
00:41:08,720 --> 00:41:11,040
no, being popular is not a good skill.

996
00:41:11,040 --> 00:41:12,320
It's not a skill at all.

997
00:41:12,320 --> 00:41:15,760
What if the person interviewing you was bullied in school?

998
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:18,400
What if they were the loser that everyone hated?

999
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:18,720
Fuck.

1000
00:41:19,520 --> 00:41:22,480
Well, then bullying is the skill you'd have to use.

1001
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:23,920
Give me the job, Derek.

1002
00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:25,280
Okay.

1003
00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:31,680
I'm going to pull out your wiener and show it to the whole office.

1004
00:41:31,680 --> 00:41:33,360
No, please, please.

1005
00:41:33,360 --> 00:41:35,040
I want six figures.

1006
00:41:35,040 --> 00:41:36,960
I'm going to pull out your little boy pee pee

1007
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:38,880
and show it to everybody in the office.

1008
00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:40,000
And I'm going to walk you around,

1009
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:43,600
make sure everyone gets a good look at your little wieners.

1010
00:41:43,600 --> 00:41:44,160
You can tell-

1011
00:41:44,160 --> 00:41:44,960
Is this your family?

1012
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:46,400
Is this a picture of your family?

1013
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:47,360
They're beautiful.

1014
00:41:48,080 --> 00:41:48,960
You should be very proud.

1015
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:50,640
You should be proud of this beautiful family you made

1016
00:41:50,640 --> 00:41:52,640
with your little wieners.

1017
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:53,280
Wieners.

1018
00:41:56,240 --> 00:41:58,560
You fucking overturn a toilet and dump it on him.

1019
00:41:58,560 --> 00:42:00,240
I never bullied anybody, so you can tell, like,

1020
00:42:00,240 --> 00:42:01,280
I don't know how to do it.

1021
00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:03,840
I'll bring the swirly to you.

1022
00:42:05,680 --> 00:42:06,640
The lovely suit.

1023
00:42:07,840 --> 00:42:10,160
It would be a shame for anything to happen to it.

1024
00:42:12,320 --> 00:42:13,360
Justin, you want to read another question?

1025
00:42:14,080 --> 00:42:15,360
I would love to.

1026
00:42:15,360 --> 00:42:17,040
More questions in 2016.

1027
00:42:17,040 --> 00:42:18,160
That's my thing.

1028
00:42:18,160 --> 00:42:20,560
I had to console my kindergartners today

1029
00:42:20,560 --> 00:42:24,320
when they found out George Washington died.

1030
00:42:24,320 --> 00:42:25,520
Rule of threes, man.

1031
00:42:29,920 --> 00:42:32,080
Next week, we're studying Abraham Lincoln.

1032
00:42:33,680 --> 00:42:37,280
How can I make next week's topic less traumatizing?

1033
00:42:37,280 --> 00:42:38,720
Especially when little Billy said,

1034
00:42:38,720 --> 00:42:41,360
just as long as Abraham Lincoln's fine.

1035
00:42:41,360 --> 00:42:42,960
Washington I could deal with, okay?

1036
00:42:43,760 --> 00:42:44,240
I get it.

1037
00:42:44,240 --> 00:42:46,560
He was old as fuck, but Lenko?

1038
00:42:46,560 --> 00:42:47,440
Let me finish the question.

1039
00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:49,520
That's from Bearer of Bad News in California.

1040
00:42:49,520 --> 00:42:49,920
Thank you.

1041
00:42:49,920 --> 00:42:52,640
Okay, now do your little jokes.

1042
00:42:52,640 --> 00:42:54,800
It is kind of a shame that you would have to spend

1043
00:42:54,800 --> 00:42:56,640
the whole class period building up

1044
00:42:56,640 --> 00:42:59,200
how awesome George Washington was,

1045
00:42:59,200 --> 00:43:00,800
and it's always going to end with,

1046
00:43:01,520 --> 00:43:02,320
then he died.

1047
00:43:03,280 --> 00:43:06,560
He was a super cool dude who did a lot of awesome stuff.

1048
00:43:07,280 --> 00:43:07,920
He's dead.

1049
00:43:07,920 --> 00:43:08,560
He was pretty sick.

1050
00:43:10,240 --> 00:43:12,640
Yeah, you know how he died of bloodletting?

1051
00:43:13,280 --> 00:43:13,680
Really?

1052
00:43:13,680 --> 00:43:15,280
You guys are like, we did it to him.

1053
00:43:15,280 --> 00:43:17,280
He had pneumonia and they put leeches on him.

1054
00:43:17,280 --> 00:43:20,160
They leave that out of Hamilton.

1055
00:43:20,160 --> 00:43:21,520
Yeah, that would be great.

1056
00:43:21,520 --> 00:43:23,520
One last ride.

1057
00:43:23,520 --> 00:43:25,440
Anyway, I'm going to go to the doctor.

1058
00:43:25,440 --> 00:43:28,160
We'll catch you guys on the Flippy Dip.

1059
00:43:28,160 --> 00:43:31,120
I don't think it will be any problem at all.

1060
00:43:31,120 --> 00:43:33,040
It should be pretty intense.

1061
00:43:33,040 --> 00:43:35,680
Right back, and then we're going to that new hand place

1062
00:43:35,680 --> 00:43:36,720
at 630, right?

1063
00:43:36,720 --> 00:43:37,440
Tight, tight, tight.

1064
00:43:37,440 --> 00:43:38,240
Meet you there.

1065
00:43:38,240 --> 00:43:39,840
Anyway, hey, yo, doc, what's up?

1066
00:43:39,840 --> 00:43:41,840
And then I've got a plan for universal health care.

1067
00:43:44,080 --> 00:43:45,840
I'll tell you guys, we're the third page

1068
00:43:45,840 --> 00:43:47,680
of the Declaration of Independence is buried.

1069
00:43:48,320 --> 00:43:50,240
And I tell you guys, I got this great plan.

1070
00:43:50,240 --> 00:43:53,280
It's called getting rid of slavery right now in 1770,

1071
00:43:53,280 --> 00:43:54,640
whatever, BRB.

1072
00:43:54,640 --> 00:43:55,600
Cool, cool, cool.

1073
00:43:55,600 --> 00:43:59,600
Listen, I'm halfway done signing the executive order,

1074
00:43:59,600 --> 00:44:01,360
but I got the carpal tunnel.

1075
00:44:01,360 --> 00:44:04,160
So I'm going to take a quick physician break

1076
00:44:04,160 --> 00:44:06,480
and then I'll get back to signing in the executive order

1077
00:44:06,480 --> 00:44:07,440
to end slavery.

1078
00:44:07,440 --> 00:44:09,280
I'll just put that Washington on there.

1079
00:44:09,280 --> 00:44:13,520
Oh, that's rough.

1080
00:44:15,760 --> 00:44:16,880
You got to lie to him.

1081
00:44:18,640 --> 00:44:20,000
And then he ascended.

1082
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:21,120
Well, no, not that.

1083
00:44:21,120 --> 00:44:22,320
Just like, he's still around.

1084
00:44:23,760 --> 00:44:25,520
Wait, how is that better?

1085
00:44:25,520 --> 00:44:26,800
I mean, he's watching us all to this day.

1086
00:44:26,800 --> 00:44:31,920
Abraham Lincoln, one of our bravest, our most decisive,

1087
00:44:31,920 --> 00:44:34,320
and also our most secretive president.

1088
00:44:34,320 --> 00:44:36,640
Whereas he today, nobody knows.

1089
00:44:36,640 --> 00:44:39,360
No, that's horse apples because there's seven billion people

1090
00:44:39,360 --> 00:44:40,800
on Earth now.

1091
00:44:40,800 --> 00:44:43,280
In your lifetime, you meet like, what, like 100?

1092
00:44:43,280 --> 00:44:45,040
And then Abe Lincoln, statistically,

1093
00:44:45,040 --> 00:44:46,560
probably is not going to be one of those.

1094
00:44:47,360 --> 00:44:48,240
It's like Bigfoot.

1095
00:44:48,800 --> 00:44:51,200
The story is, the story you give them is this.

1096
00:44:51,840 --> 00:44:54,320
Abraham Lincoln was watching a play.

1097
00:44:54,320 --> 00:44:56,800
He got shot in the head by John Wilkes Booth.

1098
00:44:56,800 --> 00:44:57,040
No, he missed.

1099
00:44:57,040 --> 00:44:59,120
Three days later, no, he got better.

1100
00:44:59,120 --> 00:45:00,720
And he's like, well, I'm not going to do this again.

1101
00:45:01,520 --> 00:45:02,320
Fuck this shit.

1102
00:45:02,320 --> 00:45:03,040
Fuck this.

1103
00:45:03,040 --> 00:45:03,680
I'm out.

1104
00:45:03,680 --> 00:45:04,880
Did you see that shit?

1105
00:45:04,880 --> 00:45:06,160
I got shot by it, dude.

1106
00:45:06,160 --> 00:45:07,680
I got shot in the head.

1107
00:45:07,680 --> 00:45:09,120
Like, I have to go.

1108
00:45:09,120 --> 00:45:10,400
I don't want to be around anymore.

1109
00:45:10,400 --> 00:45:11,760
Somebody else can be president.

1110
00:45:11,760 --> 00:45:12,720
Where are you going to go?

1111
00:45:12,720 --> 00:45:16,000
I'm going to go plant apple trees across this great nation

1112
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:16,480
of ours.

1113
00:45:16,480 --> 00:45:18,080
And I'm going to just travel, see the world.

1114
00:45:18,640 --> 00:45:20,320
And that's the story of The Pretender.

1115
00:45:21,120 --> 00:45:22,560
I'm going to go start an anonymous.

1116
00:45:25,760 --> 00:45:26,800
I'm going to go start an anonymous.

1117
00:45:26,800 --> 00:45:28,800
Let stupid Andrew Johnson be president for a while.

1118
00:45:28,800 --> 00:45:30,320
Let people take pot shots at him.

1119
00:45:30,320 --> 00:45:30,880
This is not-

1120
00:45:30,880 --> 00:45:31,360
Who?

1121
00:45:31,360 --> 00:45:32,160
I'm sorry, who?

1122
00:45:32,880 --> 00:45:33,760
Andrew Johnson?

1123
00:45:33,760 --> 00:45:36,320
Our 17th president?

1124
00:45:36,320 --> 00:45:37,200
Is that a real guy?

1125
00:45:38,560 --> 00:45:39,120
Wow.

1126
00:45:39,120 --> 00:45:41,200
Maybe Andrew Johnson's our most secretive president.

1127
00:45:44,720 --> 00:45:45,280
I can-

1128
00:45:45,280 --> 00:45:46,640
Do you want me to skip ahead to Grant?

1129
00:45:46,640 --> 00:45:47,760
I'll skip to Grant.

1130
00:45:47,760 --> 00:45:52,080
I think I only know Washington, Lincoln, Andrew Jackson, Garfield.

1131
00:45:52,800 --> 00:45:54,160
Yeah, I know of JFK.

1132
00:45:54,160 --> 00:45:55,600
Travis, don't stop.

1133
00:45:55,600 --> 00:45:56,320
There's all the presidents to go.

1134
00:45:56,320 --> 00:46:00,160
Isn't JFK when you are playing wow when you have to leave the room?

1135
00:46:00,160 --> 00:46:00,720
Stop it.

1136
00:46:00,720 --> 00:46:04,720
JFK, bio break.

1137
00:46:04,720 --> 00:46:05,280
Bio break.

1138
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:08,480
I'm watching JFK on Netflix.

1139
00:46:11,040 --> 00:46:11,600
Be right back.

1140
00:46:11,600 --> 00:46:13,360
Gotta find out who this dude is, JFK.

1141
00:46:13,360 --> 00:46:15,680
Hey guys, we can start the raid back and to the left.

1142
00:46:18,160 --> 00:46:18,640
Solid.

1143
00:46:20,160 --> 00:46:21,440
I don't know my presidents.

1144
00:46:21,440 --> 00:46:21,920
Who did you think-

1145
00:46:22,960 --> 00:46:25,040
What do you think happened after Abe Lincoln got his-

1146
00:46:25,520 --> 00:46:26,000
Got-

1147
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:27,280
They took some time off?

1148
00:46:27,280 --> 00:46:28,320
No, I'm saying-

1149
00:46:28,320 --> 00:46:30,960
Okay, but like, who do you think followed him?

1150
00:46:32,400 --> 00:46:34,560
I mean, I know it was the next president.

1151
00:46:36,480 --> 00:46:40,880
But like, how do you follow up Lincoln and everybody's like, you're just as good?

1152
00:46:41,760 --> 00:46:44,800
I think you're destined to be forgotten if you're the guy after Lincoln.

1153
00:46:45,600 --> 00:46:46,640
That's a good point.

1154
00:46:46,640 --> 00:46:47,600
Tell me anything about-

1155
00:46:47,600 --> 00:46:49,840
Please tell me about this Andrew Johnson guy, please.

1156
00:46:49,840 --> 00:46:50,320
Anything?

1157
00:46:52,160 --> 00:46:54,560
He got probably a pretty surprising telegram one day.

1158
00:46:54,560 --> 00:46:55,520
Okay.

1159
00:46:57,600 --> 00:46:59,200
I never thought it would happen to me.

1160
00:46:59,920 --> 00:47:00,560
He was at-

1161
00:47:00,560 --> 00:47:04,480
He was just in a mall with all of his friends and his dad just finished saying,

1162
00:47:04,480 --> 00:47:06,640
Andrew Johnson, you'll never amount to anything.

1163
00:47:06,640 --> 00:47:07,920
You've got to get serious.

1164
00:47:07,920 --> 00:47:13,360
And Andrew Johnson was all at the mall with his friends and he was at the Panda Express

1165
00:47:13,360 --> 00:47:15,520
and he's like, I don't have to listen to him.

1166
00:47:15,520 --> 00:47:17,040
What's the worst that could happen?

1167
00:47:17,040 --> 00:47:19,920
And then he gets a telegram saying, you're president of the United States.

1168
00:47:19,920 --> 00:47:25,120
So him and his bodyguard Sinbad went to DC and they started running the country,

1169
00:47:25,120 --> 00:47:27,840
but they started running it how a kid would.

1170
00:47:27,840 --> 00:47:29,440
So it's like, not the kid's style.

1171
00:47:29,440 --> 00:47:32,560
It's like, everybody gets free hot dogs.

1172
00:47:32,560 --> 00:47:38,800
And he filled the Oval Office pool with marshmallows and stuff and he made it.

1173
00:47:38,800 --> 00:47:46,960
And some of his stuffy cabinet members, he made them all wear sunglasses and

1174
00:47:46,960 --> 00:47:50,160
say executive orders like, what's up, dude? And things like that.

1175
00:47:50,160 --> 00:47:53,680
And that's how Andrew Johnson, kid president, got his start.

1176
00:47:53,680 --> 00:47:56,080
He was a way better president than Lincoln.

1177
00:47:56,080 --> 00:47:58,560
Yeah, he was a really cool president, people don't remember.

1178
00:47:58,560 --> 00:47:59,040
And that is-

1179
00:47:59,040 --> 00:48:00,320
And how long was he president?

1180
00:48:00,880 --> 00:48:02,320
Until he was impeached, I think.

1181
00:48:04,160 --> 00:48:06,400
By which they mean they put him in a big vat of pizzas.

1182
00:48:06,400 --> 00:48:08,400
No, I mean he was impeached.

1183
00:48:08,400 --> 00:48:09,440
Oh no.

1184
00:48:09,440 --> 00:48:10,720
Oh no, what happened?

1185
00:48:10,720 --> 00:48:12,160
Don't tell your kindergartners that.

1186
00:48:12,160 --> 00:48:13,520
That's going to really bum them out.

1187
00:48:13,520 --> 00:48:15,840
Lincoln's dead, but I think Johnson got impeached.

1188
00:48:15,840 --> 00:48:19,040
What? After he did that cool thing with the shades?

1189
00:48:20,240 --> 00:48:22,240
Wait, no, he was not impeached.

1190
00:48:22,240 --> 00:48:22,720
Not on me.

1191
00:48:22,720 --> 00:48:25,680
No, don't like fucking cast dispersions.

1192
00:48:25,680 --> 00:48:28,240
You're the one who told me about his marshmallow pool.

1193
00:48:28,240 --> 00:48:29,600
What are you worried about factually after-

1194
00:48:29,600 --> 00:48:31,360
Yeah, but they didn't impeach him.

1195
00:48:31,360 --> 00:48:34,960
They learned like, listen, we've been too serious about everything.

1196
00:48:34,960 --> 00:48:36,320
We really need to loosen it up.

1197
00:48:37,200 --> 00:48:40,960
He impeached himself because he knew that was the right thing to do for the country.

1198
00:48:40,960 --> 00:48:43,600
He was the only other president to be impeached other than Bill Clinton.

1199
00:48:43,600 --> 00:48:44,160
Is that real?

1200
00:48:44,160 --> 00:48:45,120
No.

1201
00:48:45,120 --> 00:48:48,560
Someday somebody's going to write a fucking musical about how fucking wrong you guys are

1202
00:48:48,560 --> 00:48:49,840
about Andrew Johnson right now.

1203
00:48:49,840 --> 00:48:51,520
Called Not Without My Johnson.

1204
00:48:51,520 --> 00:48:52,020
Stop!

1205
00:48:53,600 --> 00:48:54,560
How could this happen?

1206
00:48:56,080 --> 00:48:57,360
Yeah, he didn't do a good job.

1207
00:49:01,040 --> 00:49:05,760
In his defense, in Andrew Johnson's defense, he probably didn't think history would remember.

1208
00:49:05,760 --> 00:49:09,920
And by the way, if Andrew Johnson's whole fucking scam was like,

1209
00:49:09,920 --> 00:49:16,000
I'm actually going to live super high on the hog and like get crazy and buckwild constantly

1210
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:20,800
and steal from America and do whatever I want and have sex with lots of broads and guys,

1211
00:49:20,800 --> 00:49:23,600
whatever, I don't care because history will not remember.

1212
00:49:23,600 --> 00:49:26,080
And then my middle brother was like, Andrew who?

1213
00:49:26,080 --> 00:49:29,200
I think his plan worked out perfect.

1214
00:49:29,200 --> 00:49:32,240
Somewhere he dropped his shades and went, exactly.

1215
00:49:32,240 --> 00:49:33,040
Exactly.

1216
00:49:33,040 --> 00:49:39,200
That would be an amazing, now that I think about it, that would be an amazing musical.

1217
00:49:39,200 --> 00:49:40,000
That'd be an amazing-

1218
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:41,040
Andrew Johnson's day off.

1219
00:49:41,040 --> 00:49:43,920
Andrew, please fucking govern the country.

1220
00:49:43,920 --> 00:49:46,480
Nah, I'm going to go bust a nut.

1221
00:49:47,200 --> 00:49:50,480
Andrew, please God, do anything.

1222
00:49:50,480 --> 00:49:52,800
Our nation is being torn apart right now.

1223
00:49:52,800 --> 00:49:54,080
Nah, nah, nah.

1224
00:49:54,080 --> 00:49:55,200
Nah, nah, nah, nah.

1225
00:49:55,200 --> 00:49:57,040
Nah, passing it in bonbons.

1226
00:49:57,040 --> 00:49:59,840
Even those bonbons are stuffed with money.

1227
00:50:02,400 --> 00:50:04,320
It's all about the Johnsons, babe.

1228
00:50:04,320 --> 00:50:07,040
You don't have a currency named after you.

1229
00:50:07,040 --> 00:50:07,440
Nah.

1230
00:50:07,440 --> 00:50:08,640
It's the $18 bill.

1231
00:50:08,640 --> 00:50:09,600
Not yet.

1232
00:50:09,600 --> 00:50:11,200
Have you been taking bribes?

1233
00:50:11,200 --> 00:50:11,680
Yes.

1234
00:50:11,680 --> 00:50:12,320
And peyote.

1235
00:50:12,320 --> 00:50:15,440
You guys want to know the dirty shit he did?

1236
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:16,560
You ready?

1237
00:50:17,280 --> 00:50:17,600
Yes.

1238
00:50:18,480 --> 00:50:21,680
Get your ears ready because this shit's dirty.

1239
00:50:21,680 --> 00:50:25,360
Call Danielle Steele because it's about to get ribbled in here.

1240
00:50:26,160 --> 00:50:31,120
The House's primary charge against Johnson was the violation of the Tenure of Office Act

1241
00:50:31,120 --> 00:50:32,880
passed by Congress the previous year.

1242
00:50:32,880 --> 00:50:37,040
Specifically, he had removed Edwin M. Stanton, the Secretary of War,

1243
00:50:37,040 --> 00:50:40,800
whom the Tenure of Office Act was largely designed to protect, from office

1244
00:50:40,800 --> 00:50:43,360
and replaced it with General Ulysses S. Grant.

1245
00:50:44,400 --> 00:50:45,840
So he booted a dude.

1246
00:50:45,840 --> 00:50:49,520
He booted a dude who had a law made that you couldn't boot him.

1247
00:50:49,520 --> 00:50:53,600
How bad was he at his job that his friends had to pass a law to protect him?

1248
00:50:53,600 --> 00:50:58,240
I know you dudes are gonna have to impeach me, but like, I gotta do what I gotta do.

1249
00:50:58,240 --> 00:51:00,240
I gotta get this fool out of office.

1250
00:51:00,240 --> 00:51:02,000
He's the only one who knows my secrets.

1251
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:03,200
I gotta bust my nut.

1252
00:51:03,200 --> 00:51:06,560
If that guy walked into the Oval Office like,

1253
00:51:06,560 --> 00:51:08,400
President Johnson, what are you doing?

1254
00:51:08,400 --> 00:51:10,880
You're out of here, war general guy.

1255
00:51:10,880 --> 00:51:14,720
Can I suggest a sub-podcast, like a new podcast series,

1256
00:51:14,720 --> 00:51:20,800
where we just go like, it's only like 40 episodes long.

1257
00:51:20,800 --> 00:51:24,320
We just get every president, his like, dude.

1258
00:51:24,320 --> 00:51:27,840
So no, you cannot hide from our ever-watchful eye.

1259
00:51:27,840 --> 00:51:29,360
Like, I want to get all the presidents.

1260
00:51:30,320 --> 00:51:31,840
Look at you, Polk.

1261
00:51:31,840 --> 00:51:33,360
But you know what? I'm sorry.

1262
00:51:33,360 --> 00:51:36,800
I've seen Hamilton twice, and you'll never convince me he wasn't our best president.

1263
00:51:36,800 --> 00:51:37,520
Oh, fuck.

1264
00:51:39,520 --> 00:51:42,000
That's the end of the show.

1265
00:51:42,640 --> 00:51:44,320
Thank you so much for listening to it.

1266
00:51:44,320 --> 00:51:45,120
I hope you had fun.

1267
00:51:45,760 --> 00:51:49,040
We have two new, very exciting projects to tell you about.

1268
00:51:49,920 --> 00:51:53,840
On Tuesday, which is tomorrow, you're gonna get two new podcasts.

1269
00:51:54,640 --> 00:51:56,000
One is called Still Buffering.

1270
00:51:56,000 --> 00:52:00,800
That's my wife, Sydney, and my sister-in-law, Riley, who is a teenager.

1271
00:52:00,800 --> 00:52:05,520
And talking about, like, how it was being a teen when they were growing up.

1272
00:52:05,520 --> 00:52:08,320
And how it is now for teenagers.

1273
00:52:08,320 --> 00:52:09,520
I learned a lot.

1274
00:52:09,520 --> 00:52:13,200
Like, it made me feel kind of old, but also kind of plugged in.

1275
00:52:13,200 --> 00:52:17,040
Because I wasn't aware that, like, Sydney mentioned bringing,

1276
00:52:17,040 --> 00:52:21,840
on the first episode, Sydney mentioned bringing, like, a folder of CDs to a party.

1277
00:52:21,840 --> 00:52:24,640
And Riley was, like, in terror at that idea.

1278
00:52:24,640 --> 00:52:28,000
I was like, oh my god, I guess it is kind of whack.

1279
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:29,760
I didn't even really think about it.

1280
00:52:29,760 --> 00:52:31,520
But that's called Still Buffering.

1281
00:52:31,520 --> 00:52:32,640
And that's on Tuesday.

1282
00:52:32,640 --> 00:52:35,280
Trav, do you want to tell them about the other show that will normally be on Fridays,

1283
00:52:35,280 --> 00:52:37,680
but will also have its first episode on Tuesday?

1284
00:52:37,680 --> 00:52:39,920
Yeah, we're launching a show called Schmanners.

1285
00:52:40,480 --> 00:52:45,760
It's me and my wife, Theresa McElroy, talking about etiquette and manners in the modern age.

1286
00:52:45,760 --> 00:52:50,880
And some stuff that may seem old-fashioned and a little archaic.

1287
00:52:50,880 --> 00:52:52,960
But I think it still applies in the modern world.

1288
00:52:52,960 --> 00:52:55,920
And that's kind of our hypothesis.

1289
00:52:55,920 --> 00:52:58,800
So our first episode is dealing with thank you notes.

1290
00:52:58,800 --> 00:53:01,680
And our second episode is all about table manners.

1291
00:53:02,320 --> 00:53:05,040
The first episode is coming out Tuesday, so tomorrow.

1292
00:53:05,040 --> 00:53:06,480
And the second one will be on Friday.

1293
00:53:06,480 --> 00:53:09,120
So you'll get a double dose this first week.

1294
00:53:09,120 --> 00:53:11,680
And then after that, every episode will be up on Friday.

1295
00:53:11,680 --> 00:53:12,800
I'm really looking forward to it.

1296
00:53:12,800 --> 00:53:17,440
My wife is, like, really, really good at this and knows way more about manners and etiquette than I do.

1297
00:53:17,440 --> 00:53:19,600
And I make no claim to know anything about them.

1298
00:53:19,600 --> 00:53:23,680
And if you want to find out more about it or just find links to, like, check out the promos,

1299
00:53:23,680 --> 00:53:24,640
I'm going to remind you.

1300
00:53:24,640 --> 00:53:29,040
McElroyShows.com has links to all of our projects, including the video projects.

1301
00:53:29,040 --> 00:53:32,000
So you can find all the My Brother, My Brother, and Me videos.

1302
00:53:33,040 --> 00:53:34,560
The Monster Factory videos.

1303
00:53:34,560 --> 00:53:35,440
Griffin's Amiibo Corner.

1304
00:53:35,440 --> 00:53:35,680
Thank you.

1305
00:53:35,680 --> 00:53:38,000
There's a new one up, by the way, if you haven't seen it, of Yoshi.

1306
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:38,480
Ooh!

1307
00:53:38,480 --> 00:53:39,200
New Yoshi.

1308
00:53:40,560 --> 00:53:42,800
And maybe some other stuff you didn't already know about.

1309
00:53:42,800 --> 00:53:46,000
And there's links to all the Twitter accounts and Facebook groups and everything.

1310
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:46,720
Go check it out.

1311
00:53:46,720 --> 00:53:48,960
And Rachel and I have a podcast called Rose Buddies.

1312
00:53:48,960 --> 00:53:49,840
We talk about The Bachelor.

1313
00:53:49,840 --> 00:53:50,400
It's pretty good.

1314
00:53:51,120 --> 00:53:54,480
And I'm going to get it in a podcast feed before this episode goes up.

1315
00:53:54,480 --> 00:53:55,360
There, I've said.

1316
00:53:55,360 --> 00:53:56,400
I threw my hat over the fence.

1317
00:53:57,520 --> 00:53:59,440
I also want to say I got the new P.O. Box set up.

1318
00:53:59,440 --> 00:54:00,000
Oh, nice.

1319
00:54:00,800 --> 00:54:06,560
Yeah, it's P.O. Box 909, Van Nuys, California, 91408.

1320
00:54:07,280 --> 00:54:11,360
And I want to thank everybody who sent stuff already.

1321
00:54:11,360 --> 00:54:15,680
We got a bunch of presents in the old P.O. Box.

1322
00:54:15,680 --> 00:54:17,600
So thanks everybody who sent something.

1323
00:54:17,600 --> 00:54:23,840
I want to say a special thank you to Stuart Wellington, who sent me some immune boosters

1324
00:54:23,840 --> 00:54:29,360
and a first aid kit because I have announced that should I die, Stuart has to take over

1325
00:54:29,360 --> 00:54:31,280
for me until death do us part.

1326
00:54:31,280 --> 00:54:33,600
And he's trying to keep me alive as long as he can.

1327
00:54:34,240 --> 00:54:38,320
And should Abraham Lincoln die, I will take over as the nation's chillest dude.

1328
00:54:39,120 --> 00:54:41,520
Thank you to John Roderick and the Long Winters for the use of our theme song,

1329
00:54:41,520 --> 00:54:43,360
It's a Departure, off the album Putting the Days to Bed.

1330
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:45,120
You can find it on iTunes.

1331
00:54:45,120 --> 00:54:46,720
You can find it on Amazon.

1332
00:54:46,720 --> 00:54:48,720
You can find it wherever music is sold.

1333
00:54:48,720 --> 00:54:49,360
Suncoast?

1334
00:54:50,560 --> 00:54:51,120
Is that still a thing?

1335
00:54:51,120 --> 00:54:52,400
Suncoast, maybe?

1336
00:54:52,400 --> 00:54:54,160
Sam Goody?

1337
00:54:54,160 --> 00:54:56,480
You could probably just buy a Sam Goody at this point.

1338
00:54:56,480 --> 00:54:56,880
Yeah, sure.

1339
00:54:57,440 --> 00:55:00,240
And then just keep all the Long Winters albums you find there.

1340
00:55:01,680 --> 00:55:02,960
And did we say the other max-

1341
00:55:02,960 --> 00:55:04,960
God, Sam Goody's been out of business for a decade.

1342
00:55:04,960 --> 00:55:05,680
Oh my god.

1343
00:55:06,480 --> 00:55:08,240
Did we say to listen to the other max fun shows?

1344
00:55:08,880 --> 00:55:09,520
Do that.

1345
00:55:09,520 --> 00:55:11,360
Yeah, go listen to the other max fun shows.

1346
00:55:11,360 --> 00:55:14,640
Stop podcasting yourself, Jordan Jesse Goh, Throwing Shade.

1347
00:55:15,360 --> 00:55:16,880
So many amazing shows all on the network.

Just go to maximumfun.org.

1349

You'll find them all there.

00:55:19,040 --> 00:55:19,840
All right, that's it.

1351
00:55:19,840 --> 00:55:23,680
Yep, Final Yahoo, sent in by Level 9000 Yajur, Drew at Drew Davenport.

1352
00:55:23,680 --> 00:55:24,320
Thank you, Drew.

1353
00:55:24,320 --> 00:55:27,280
It's by Yajur Answers user Cole who asks,

1354
00:55:28,160 --> 00:55:33,840
are all Power Rangers episodes swearless or do some have swearing for my kids?

1355
00:55:36,160 --> 00:55:37,040
God, I wish.

1356
00:55:37,040 --> 00:55:38,960
My name is Justin McElroy.

1357
00:55:38,960 --> 00:55:40,480
I'm Travis McElroy.

1358
00:55:40,480 --> 00:55:41,760
I'm Griffin McElroy.

1359
00:55:41,760 --> 00:55:43,040
It's fucking morphin' time.

1360
00:55:43,040 --> 00:55:44,320
This has been my brother, my brother, and me.

1361
00:55:44,320 --> 00:55:53,920
Kiss your dad, scratch the lips.

1366
00:56:08,560 --> 00:56:09,840
Hello, internet.

1367
00:56:09,840 --> 00:56:11,360
I'm Travis McElroy.

1368
00:56:11,360 --> 00:56:12,880
And I'm Theresa McElroy.

1369
00:56:12,880 --> 00:56:13,920
She is my wife.

1370
00:56:13,920 --> 00:56:15,120
And he's my husband.

1371
00:56:15,120 --> 00:56:18,240
And it is our pleasure to introduce to you a brand new podcast.

1372
00:56:18,880 --> 00:56:20,240
Shmanners.

1373
00:56:20,240 --> 00:56:21,920
It's extraordinary etiquette.

1374
00:56:21,920 --> 00:56:23,440
For ordinary occasions.

1375
00:56:23,440 --> 00:56:24,720
Theresa, let me ask you this.

1376
00:56:24,720 --> 00:56:27,040
Can you teach me how to write a thank you note?

1377
00:56:27,040 --> 00:56:28,080
Yes, I can.

1378
00:56:28,080 --> 00:56:30,320
How about tips to improve my table manners?

1379
00:56:30,320 --> 00:56:31,760
I'll do my best.

1380
00:56:31,760 --> 00:56:36,480
And will you finally explain to me the difference between casual and business casual

1381
00:56:36,480 --> 00:56:40,160
and cocktail and formal and black tie and all that stuff?

1382
00:56:40,160 --> 00:56:42,240
If anybody can, I can.

1383
00:56:42,240 --> 00:56:43,840
But like, it's going to be funny, right?

1384
00:56:43,840 --> 00:56:44,880
Of course.

1385
00:56:44,880 --> 00:56:51,360
I'm going to give historical origins and how those manners fit into our everyday lives.

1386
00:56:51,360 --> 00:56:52,880
How could it not be funny?

1387
00:56:52,880 --> 00:56:56,160
But also sometimes we'll talk about like burps and farts, right?

1388
00:56:56,160 --> 00:56:57,280
Yeah, when not to.

1389
00:56:57,280 --> 00:56:58,480
But we'll still talk about it.

1390
00:56:59,120 --> 00:56:59,920
Yes.

1391
00:56:59,920 --> 00:57:00,320
Great.

1392
00:57:00,320 --> 00:57:02,960
So come join us for our new hilarious show.

1393
00:57:02,960 --> 00:57:05,040
No RSVP required.

1394
00:57:05,040 --> 00:57:08,400
Coming to you soon every Friday on Maximumfun.org.

1395
00:57:08,400 --> 00:57:09,520
It's Shmanners.

1396
00:57:10,080 --> 00:57:11,840
Manners, Shmanners.

1397
00:57:11,840 --> 00:57:16,720
Get it?
