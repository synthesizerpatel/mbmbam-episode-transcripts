1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,820
The McElroy brothers are not experts and their advice should never be followed

2
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:10,580
Travis insists. He's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall. I haven't seen it

3
00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:17,660
Also, this show isn't for kids which I mentioned only so the babies out there will know how cool they are for listening

4
00:00:17,660 --> 00:00:30,660
What's up, you cool, baby?

5
00:00:47,660 --> 00:00:49,660
It's better, it's better with you

6
00:00:53,940 --> 00:00:55,940
It's better, it's better with you

7
00:01:00,260 --> 00:01:02,260
It's better, it's better with you

8
00:01:09,940 --> 00:01:15,420
Hello everybody welcome to the party everybody get up inside a slam now

9
00:01:15,420 --> 00:01:19,860
We got my brother, my brother and me going now. Wake into the space jam

10
00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:22,340
It's your chance

11
00:01:22,340 --> 00:01:28,820
Now don't touch the back or just put it in the hoop. I'm Justin one of them's Travis one of them's Griffin. Listen

12
00:01:28,820 --> 00:01:30,300
Here's the thing

13
00:01:30,300 --> 00:01:32,300
Yeah, big dog. Yeah

14
00:01:32,940 --> 00:01:37,220
Here's the thing. Okay space jam did come out a week ago as the code flies

15
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:44,060
As we're recording this a week ago and we fucked up because we accidentally did a whole episode about fucking lame-ass parties

16
00:01:44,060 --> 00:01:47,940
Yeah, and then I got off the call and as I was getting off the calls like oh my god

17
00:01:47,940 --> 00:01:54,500
We talked about space and not jam about it. We were so close because a fucking Jeff Bezos. Yeah

18
00:01:56,500 --> 00:01:59,420
Like he always does distracted us from the important

19
00:02:00,940 --> 00:02:08,140
Let's actually start there if I could okay, it's a new film space jam a new legacy which Griffin and I have enjoyed it

20
00:02:08,140 --> 00:02:15,460
I have yes, um and Travis has not partake in it has not partaken yet. I want to say one thing up front

21
00:02:15,460 --> 00:02:20,300
This is not part of talking about but like this why we haven't started talking about it

22
00:02:20,300 --> 00:02:22,300
We haven't this is this is the preamble

23
00:02:22,300 --> 00:02:27,880
This is the horse do verse to the conversation about why is it called space jam?

24
00:02:28,580 --> 00:02:30,580
Because they can't

25
00:02:31,380 --> 00:02:34,880
Not in this one space was in the first one if you remember

26
00:02:35,580 --> 00:02:37,060
cyberspace in it

27
00:02:37,060 --> 00:02:44,040
Now cyberspace jam would have been a much better name cyberspace jam is actually a fucking great name because cyberspace is in it

28
00:02:44,060 --> 00:02:48,260
Okay, Travis. I'm just gonna tell Griffin and I are gonna be telling you wild shit about this movie

29
00:02:48,260 --> 00:02:54,460
Okay, and I don't want to try to what you had pitched is like we would make things up. I don't even think

30
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:58,120
We okay. I have the game. Are you ready for the game?

31
00:03:00,580 --> 00:03:05,220
Griffin and I are gonna tell you wild shit about space jam a new legacy

32
00:03:05,220 --> 00:03:13,540
Okay, but each wild thing we tell each other has to top the the wild previous thing of the previous thing

33
00:03:13,660 --> 00:03:19,500
Okay, so if we go deep in the paint too early and Travis if the other one can't come up with a wild thing that

34
00:03:19,580 --> 00:03:24,380
Tops the previous wild thing then we start a new round and you're the judge. Okay. Okay, great. Great. Okay

35
00:03:24,380 --> 00:03:28,140
So try and start low juice. There's a lot don't don't come at it with a

36
00:03:28,780 --> 00:03:32,980
Hot, okay. No, here's okay. Here's what we'll do. Here's how we make it fair, right?

37
00:03:32,980 --> 00:03:40,500
Justin well, whoever goes first right has to if the other person can't top there's top their own to show that it could have been

38
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:47,040
Spelling be rules. Yes, we should also say that like

39
00:03:48,820 --> 00:03:50,820
Spoilers

40
00:03:51,460 --> 00:03:53,840
Industry now so like everybody worked really hard on this

41
00:03:58,940 --> 00:04:00,940
Jordan is in it

42
00:04:00,940 --> 00:04:03,540
But not that Michael Jordan

43
00:04:04,420 --> 00:04:06,420
What?

44
00:04:06,740 --> 00:04:07,940
It's a great gag

45
00:04:07,940 --> 00:04:14,280
I almost feel like this is the only the only spoilable thing about the film so like we did warn you at the top

46
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:20,420
We warned you at the top. It's a fucking great gag. I like Michael B. Jordan or something. Yeah, but it's Michael B

47
00:04:20,420 --> 00:04:22,420
Jordan, it's so fucking funny

48
00:04:23,420 --> 00:04:29,540
Except for it does kind of lean into like some some unsettling things about the linden's perception of human beings

49
00:04:29,540 --> 00:04:33,880
Yeah, because they do think it is the Michael Jordan that they are dear friends with. Yeah, and spend

50
00:04:34,580 --> 00:04:42,260
Time with there's a codicil there where Sylvester says it has been 25 years which then sent me made me feel like a mummy

51
00:04:42,460 --> 00:04:44,460
Yeah, maybe feel like a old

52
00:04:45,780 --> 00:04:47,780
Griffin can you beat that?

53
00:04:48,060 --> 00:04:49,580
there's a

54
00:04:49,580 --> 00:04:51,580
matrix parody in which

55
00:04:52,220 --> 00:04:56,420
men shoot at Speedy Gonzales with deadly guns

56
00:04:56,420 --> 00:04:59,460
Weaponry they shoot realistic guns

57
00:05:00,420 --> 00:05:05,140
Bullets, I mean it's a it's essentially a clip from the matrix, but they did put

58
00:05:05,860 --> 00:05:11,420
You know what you speed round that whole sequence. Let's just ping pong it back and forth

59
00:05:11,420 --> 00:05:15,940
I take back my Speedy Gonzales being shot at because that is part for the course for the Looney Tunes

60
00:05:15,940 --> 00:05:18,780
I am going to say Travis there is a

61
00:05:19,220 --> 00:05:20,180
good

62
00:05:20,180 --> 00:05:26,660
Long chunk of Austin Powers in the travel good. There's like a good bit of Austin Powers in this one

63
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:27,620
Yes

64
00:05:27,620 --> 00:05:33,140
Powers has been in the movie for about 20 years and it's in Space Jam because they go into like

65
00:05:33,420 --> 00:05:37,760
Do a scene of that they do a scene where they're in Austin Powers

66
00:05:38,020 --> 00:05:43,140
Yeah, Trav Trav trap that okay. So that was Griffin mine is they do a scene

67
00:05:43,140 --> 00:05:57,140
in the Mad Max, what? Mad Max, Ferry, Rebel Brawn and fucking Bugs are huffing paint and fucking chasing Valhalla

68
00:05:57,140 --> 00:06:03,140
Yeah and fucking Oily Coyote has a sign in his hand that says witness

69
00:06:03,540 --> 00:06:08,420
And listen, I saw a lot of haters out there saying wow, what a fucking

70
00:06:08,420 --> 00:06:15,340
Cash-in sellout the best. It's good. That's good stuff. It's so good

71
00:06:15,580 --> 00:06:20,340
It's so good. That's good that that happened. It's not bad that that happened

72
00:06:20,340 --> 00:06:24,300
It's actually good and I would say Looney Griffin top that

73
00:06:25,980 --> 00:06:27,980
God I mean, okay

74
00:06:28,020 --> 00:06:32,780
We could even start with John Cheadle is a cyber man who steals

75
00:06:32,780 --> 00:06:38,380
LeBron James's son and takes him to teach him that it's okay

76
00:06:38,380 --> 00:06:43,780
He's not good at basketball and that's okay to be good at video games. Yeah, that's a great lesson

77
00:06:44,820 --> 00:06:48,820
but it turns because then LeBron James's son is like

78
00:06:48,820 --> 00:06:55,860
I don't care if this leads to the destruction of mankind. I'm gonna beat my dad at cyber basketball

79
00:06:55,860 --> 00:07:00,940
So we're in a hook situation is what you're saying. Exactly. It's exactly a hook situation

80
00:07:00,940 --> 00:07:02,940
Does that top?

81
00:07:03,220 --> 00:07:07,980
Now Travis I have a question though was Griffin's thing an escalation or do I get a point?

82
00:07:07,980 --> 00:07:12,300
Well, I want to say Justin gets a point because the only way it would have been an escalation is if it was John

83
00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:18,740
Cheadle as Don Cheadle doing this. It's his name is algae rhythm. Uh-huh. Okay, we've discussed this

84
00:07:18,740 --> 00:07:21,460
We just we can't pretend like that's news to us

85
00:07:21,460 --> 00:07:26,380
We've discussed it on the show next round you start. Yeah, I start off. Okay

86
00:07:26,380 --> 00:07:30,980
Um, there's a rap battle with Porky Pig and

87
00:07:31,900 --> 00:07:36,460
Algae rhythm I say a rap battle. It's pretty one-sided. I don't think algae rhythm ever gets a hand on the ball

88
00:07:36,460 --> 00:07:42,220
Yeah, rads are weird. They're a rap battle where algae rhythm does not produce does not wrap and so wrecked by Porky Pig

89
00:07:45,380 --> 00:07:48,940
Probably but he comes at it with you expect him to be like the

90
00:07:49,660 --> 00:07:53,060
And like come at it with some like real rap God energy

91
00:07:53,060 --> 00:07:59,780
Yeah, some real twista energy, but it's very he raps very slow and bad

92
00:08:01,740 --> 00:08:09,020
Yeah, I was actually kind of getting pumped up because I felt like it would actually be kind of fun to watch Porky Pig

93
00:08:09,460 --> 00:08:10,860
absolutely

94
00:08:10,860 --> 00:08:12,860
destroy

95
00:08:15,420 --> 00:08:17,220
People like he does

96
00:08:17,220 --> 00:08:23,780
But he don't but it sucks. It sucks shit. They even do the like, you know the meme where the guys like kind of

97
00:08:23,940 --> 00:08:28,540
Reacting to the rap battle and and it's that one where he's like running across the screen with you know

98
00:08:28,540 --> 00:08:31,180
She saw it but they're acting like it's a very big

99
00:08:31,660 --> 00:08:36,680
Win when it is actually just like about as good as Porky Pig. I would think would do a rap

100
00:08:37,780 --> 00:08:39,940
What they should have done and I haven't seen it

101
00:08:39,940 --> 00:08:41,420
But maybe this does happen

102
00:08:41,420 --> 00:08:46,040
They should have instead had to be like a king speech thing where someone teaches Porky Pig not to stutter

103
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:48,040
I think that's the whole movie. Yeah

104
00:08:48,380 --> 00:08:53,140
That would be way more exciting to me. Okay, I got I got one as long as we're keeping a little mile here

105
00:08:53,660 --> 00:08:55,380
LeBron

106
00:08:55,380 --> 00:09:01,820
The story is about LeBron as a father and he does have kids in it. Uh-huh, but they're not his kids

107
00:09:03,820 --> 00:09:05,220
They're made up

108
00:09:05,220 --> 00:09:10,540
They're made up kids that are based on his kids LeBron James has actual kids in real life. Yes

109
00:09:10,540 --> 00:09:17,060
They did not cast those kids. No, not only did they not cast those kids the names have been changed to fictional kids

110
00:09:17,140 --> 00:09:22,580
But LeBron does not have I see I see I see that's pretty weird, but I'm gonna say give Griffin that point

111
00:09:22,940 --> 00:09:29,220
Okay, because that's not super wild to me because I don't know if I got a chance to invent better versions of my kids

112
00:09:29,220 --> 00:09:34,300
It's not that my kids are great. Yeah, I take it. I'll give him my like I can understand the reasoning behind it

113
00:09:34,300 --> 00:09:38,460
It is a wild thing though. Griffin. Yeah any other ones just bump it around your head. Oh

114
00:09:38,460 --> 00:09:44,420
Oh god, I'll just drop one then cuz like I feel like the pace. Let's do just like lightning round

115
00:09:44,420 --> 00:09:49,740
It doesn't even have the top. It's just like whoever can't come up with a wild thing. Here's one trap

116
00:09:51,060 --> 00:09:53,420
Hey trap. Yeah, here's one. Yeah

117
00:09:54,300 --> 00:09:58,940
When LeBron and the Looney Tunes are playing in basketball

118
00:09:59,980 --> 00:10:05,940
The they are being watched by Voldemort and the look he'd Phoenix Joker. Wait

119
00:10:05,940 --> 00:10:11,140
Wait, what? Oh, okay, and I'm gonna take it one up top. Well, I'm gonna take I'm on one. Oh, wait

120
00:10:11,140 --> 00:10:13,140
You can't just say that

121
00:10:14,260 --> 00:10:17,540
And while they're playing basketball they are also being watched by

122
00:10:18,060 --> 00:10:21,800
The fucking dudes from Clockwork Orange is also in it

123
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:28,500
Watching it and they're like we love basketball and it's like I don't I've I've never seen the Clockwork Orange film

124
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:31,900
But I do believe those those gentlemen are quite quite rotten

125
00:10:31,900 --> 00:10:37,940
Uh, it's like watching videos though. I yeah seems a vaguely recalled that

126
00:10:38,300 --> 00:10:42,860
yeah, but in the in the stands in the audience because the premise is like

127
00:10:43,700 --> 00:10:48,360
That it's inside the servers of all of Warner Brothers

128
00:10:48,380 --> 00:10:51,340
So all their IP gets to come watch them play basketball

129
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:55,340
So more a thinly veiled reference to like white supremacy

130
00:10:55,340 --> 00:11:01,180
Yeah, Nazi is it was like I would like to watch the basketball the more it's there though. Joe

131
00:11:01,180 --> 00:11:07,340
Call me Baltimore the serious murder Joker and not the fun Joe fun Joker

132
00:11:07,380 --> 00:11:11,940
They could have had fun Joker and but they do have fun penguin. How about that?

133
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:16,220
Fuck yeah, but not Danny DeVito

134
00:11:16,940 --> 00:11:21,080
Well, that would have been abs now Travis that would have been even too wild for space

135
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:27,140
Yeah, if that's that fish sucking monster had been there in the stands watching them get wild

136
00:11:28,340 --> 00:11:32,260
Fuck this fuck. Let's talk about the goon squad. Yeah

137
00:11:32,860 --> 00:11:34,860
so the goon squad is

138
00:11:35,740 --> 00:11:41,500
based on scans of actual players in the NBA and WNBA like the monster and

139
00:11:42,140 --> 00:11:44,020
but but

140
00:11:44,020 --> 00:11:47,420
They've been given they've been blended with other

141
00:11:47,420 --> 00:11:55,420
Things like us. There's a snake woman and a spider person and a guy who can turn into water and also fire

142
00:11:55,420 --> 00:12:02,060
and so they set all this up like oh this kid scan these players with his phone and now they've got

143
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:08,840
Superpowers and that's the team and then about halfway through the game Don Cheadle's like but check out my

144
00:12:09,860 --> 00:12:14,240
Time-traveling robot that's also on the team and it's like who the

145
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:18,580
Get ready for Kronos the basketball player who can freeze time

146
00:12:18,580 --> 00:12:23,360
It's like I thought everybody was based on actual players that had special props. No, okay

147
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:28,240
We're just like a step line a hat on a hat where it's like I'm wearing a hat and I built a hat store on

148
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:33,440
Top of yes and imagine Travis and Space Jam 1 if Swackhammer the big alien mean boss

149
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:35,200
I was like this games not going the way I want

150
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:40,600
I'm gonna eat some basketball power to get huge too cuz the algae rhythm does that and he's like fuck this

151
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:46,320
I'm playing now and you get to see a huge muscle II just ripped Don Cheadle

152
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:53,080
But you know, yeah, I understand that they play fast and loose with the rules these games, but that can't be allowed

153
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:59,960
Oh, don't worry about it rules have gone completely out the fucking window the game at the end of Space Jam 2 is a disgrace

154
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:02,040
To pass it's not it. Yeah, it's embarrassing

155
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:09,520
It's like the scene in my ducks when the ducks get so funny and he's like that was actually too funny

156
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:16,760
Yeah, and I'm back being Gordon Bombay the lawyer now, and I'm mad again. Yeah. Yeah now I'm mad at you guys juice

157
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:22,560
I just did a few. I'm sorry. You know, it's all good. It's all good. I'm I got one for you Travis

158
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:28,440
I got one for you. I should have mentioned that the Night King from gamer fans is also watching and play best, huh?

159
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:33,560
They're having fun. Yeah, he's killed a lot of people. They're all there. They have a lot of murders in there, huh?

160
00:13:33,560 --> 00:13:42,280
Yeah, there's like a lot of fun. The internet says that Danny DeVito's penguin is actually I think he's I think I did see him

161
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:48,560
So that penguin too, okay, but it's not Danny DeVito playing. It's like obviously not

162
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:51,800
You probably didn't need to say that it's Manny Belvita

163
00:13:51,800 --> 00:14:01,360
Manny Belvita is what you get when you do like a fly experiment and accidentally cross Danny DeVito with a breakfast cookie

164
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:03,400
Right, exactly. Yes

165
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:08,200
Iron Giants in it, which is wild because he was also in the other one. You know what I mean?

166
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:11,920
Yeah, yeah, they couldn't is a Vin Diesel in it as a

167
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:14,800
No, that's Universal, isn't it?

168
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:20,480
Listen listen, this is my biggest one. The Monstars are in it, but in their small

169
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:22,640
supplicant

170
00:14:22,640 --> 00:14:24,640
Alien forms

171
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:28,800
No, no, neither is but more importantly wait night

172
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:31,760
No way

173
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:36,880
Listen the little aliens from Space Jam 1 are in it, right and they're in the crowd

174
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:45,260
Right when the goon squad does well and slams and smashes and just blasts the toon squad

175
00:14:45,260 --> 00:14:51,940
These little aliens go wild cheering and when the Looney Tunes start to win the basketball game

176
00:14:52,700 --> 00:14:59,740
The month these these little aliens who were the Monstars in Space Jam 1 get sad and disappointed

177
00:14:59,740 --> 00:15:04,300
No, that's bullshit. That's not cannon. That's not cannon at the end of Space Jam 1

178
00:15:04,300 --> 00:15:10,940
They like joined the Looney Tunes to live in toontown and be silly aliens and now you expect me to believe

179
00:15:10,940 --> 00:15:14,700
That they've turned it against them. They bet a lot of money

180
00:15:14,700 --> 00:15:18,940
They just bet a lot of money against because they're like we know that the Looney Tunes will win, right?

181
00:15:18,940 --> 00:15:23,300
So it's got to be long odds and they put a lot of money on the fucking goon squad

182
00:15:23,300 --> 00:15:27,260
I guess so it's not about person. It made me so angry to like

183
00:15:28,100 --> 00:15:35,320
No, Michael Jordan at no way night. Whatever like you can't get the folks. That's fine. But do you have you got this wrong?

184
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:43,000
You undid all the work. You got this wrong. You did all the work and this is wrong. They love the Looney Tunes

185
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:49,640
Trav, I just I just dropped a still in there just to get you like really worked up, huh?

186
00:15:49,640 --> 00:15:51,960
I just dropped a still in the slot. Oh shit

187
00:15:52,760 --> 00:15:56,520
Can you tell me who you see in this slot? Oh shit, just top of my head

188
00:15:56,520 --> 00:16:01,060
There's the mask and he's wearing what appears to be some sort of referee shirt. We have

189
00:16:01,060 --> 00:16:08,680
We've got Danny DeVito just poking his head over there's the Joker. Yeah, there's that looks like I'm gonna go with penguin

190
00:16:08,680 --> 00:16:12,680
Not the Joker. Oh, thank you. I'm gonna say that's agent J or agent K

191
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:17,000
No, it's one of the matrix no

192
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:25,000
There's there's mr. Freeze and a nun I

193
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:30,840
Get a nun from the from the x-rated film The Devils that is

194
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:36,680
For some reason in the back. There's a woman who looks like like June Cleaver. Yeah. Oh

195
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:44,160
Trav just two other things that I needed to tell you real quick. I have a actually like it and the Hamburglar

196
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:46,880
The ham what?

197
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:53,280
That's great Trav, that's great. That's great. I'm gonna play a quick audio clip for you for this one

198
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:55,280
Or else you won't believe me

199
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:16,520
Yes, Rick and Morty in air in it they're in it they are explicitly not loony tunes

200
00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:20,400
They're not loony tunes. They're regular tunes. Can I tell you one of that?

201
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:25,680
Can I tell you of all the things you've said to me today? Nothing is more

202
00:17:26,440 --> 00:17:28,000
offensive to me

203
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
than the inclusion of

204
00:17:30,040 --> 00:17:35,840
Huge Rick and Morty head. No, just the idea of like, okay, you're gonna include like real people in it

205
00:17:36,040 --> 00:17:41,520
Okay, great a crossover. That's great. But then also just like here's other cartoons

206
00:17:42,040 --> 00:17:47,840
This isn't fucking who frame Roger rabbit Travis Travis. You should not see this fuck

207
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:55,760
Oh, hey Trav. Don't watch this. You're not ready go to some different places in this man. What are what are the rules?

208
00:17:56,480 --> 00:18:00,800
There's no rules Justin. What's your last thing? Cuz I got one last thing too that I think it's gonna be the

209
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:06,880
See, I feel like mine is all right. Let's see. Let's hear it. This is it Travis. This is for all the marbles

210
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:08,840
This is for all the marbles

211
00:18:08,840 --> 00:18:13,320
Griff let's say him at the same time. I want to say three two one and then we both say it. Okay, okay

212
00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:18,320
three two one Bugs Bunny dies at the end

213
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:29,640
Hey Trav

214
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:31,640
Hey Trav. Bugs Bunny dies in the sleep.

215
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:33,640
Bugs dies at the end.

216
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:35,640
Do you wanna do some Bugs Bunny dies?

217
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:37,040
In order to win the game

218
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:42,560
They got to do a special basketball move that will freeze the simulation and kill whoever does it and LeBron James is like

219
00:18:42,560 --> 00:18:43,520
I'm gonna do it for my son

220
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:49,400
But then Bugs steals the ball and does it and dies and Travis for the extra bonus points

221
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:53,360
Bugs Bunny's last words before he passes from the mortal coil are

222
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,000
What's down doc, I don't know

223
00:18:57,880 --> 00:18:59,880
That's pretty good. That's pretty good

224
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:02,920
It's

225
00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:04,920
That's all folks. Oh

226
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:12,480
Oh, that's touching. Oh god. What's down doc is actually extremely extremely choice. Well, he's afraid of going to hell

227
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:16,000
So he's asking like what's down there? You know what I mean? I don't care to die, but

228
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:27,880
So that is

229
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:33,240
You can't just say Bugs dies. I'm not gonna watch this fucking play. We can't spoil everything Bugs dies

230
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:35,240
Um, and then he's crazy

231
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:45,600
Just later he's there and LeBron James is like you died and bugs buddies like no I didn't

232
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:53,040
That's the dumbest thing you've ever said LeBron James you fucking idiot anyway, I'm gonna sleep at your home

233
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:57,400
Okay in the film and honestly folks

234
00:19:57,400 --> 00:20:04,840
You probably should still watch it it's it's good. It's a it's great. It's supremely amazing. Hi. It's

235
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:09,200
Amazing. I do actually want to watch it more. My kids were kind of like

236
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:13,760
Idly watching at it and I'm like standing on my couch

237
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:21,040
Tripping my shirt in half every five seconds because it's so utterly unhinged. It's not a movie

238
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:23,040
No, no, no, no, no strictest sense

239
00:20:23,040 --> 00:20:27,900
In the strictest sense, but it's a heck of a thing. Hey, this is an advice show

240
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:36,920
If you're about to tweet at any of us that we spent too long talking about space jam a new legacy or not long enough

241
00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:39,160
And if you're about to be there mad out spoilers or whatever

242
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:43,120
Well that you can be mad about but if you're about to say we talked about too much

243
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:48,920
I I encourage you to go listen to another podcast because this is this is who we are you you had to know

244
00:20:48,920 --> 00:20:54,720
What you were what you were jacking into at this point after 10 after 11 years?

245
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:56,840
This is an advice show obviously

246
00:20:56,840 --> 00:20:58,840
So I wanted to give some advice to people

247
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:05,000
The position of mayor in my very small town is mostly symbolic but would look great on a resume

248
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,480
I have enough friends to get the votes next election

249
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:13,520
But here's the tricky part the current mayor owns a record store. I go hang out at almost every weekend

250
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:20,960
How do I unseat him without severing the relationship we have? That's from new mayor in New York

251
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:30,200
Hmm, I mean you want to unseat Bill de Blasio you think you have enough friends to secure that

252
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:33,040
Also another weird thing

253
00:21:33,560 --> 00:21:38,960
Bill de Blasio is a record store. Oh, yeah, it's crazy. Oh, yeah. He loves that stuff

254
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:41,760
They may mean New York State

255
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:49,440
Maybe that is actually that makes wicked more sense. Yeah a lot more so that might be possible. There doesn't have to be hard feelings

256
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:55,280
Former Huntington mayor Jean Dean passed away this week. I'm sure you know sad news. Yeah

257
00:21:55,280 --> 00:22:01,160
Yeah, yeah, Jean Dean passed away this weekend Steve Williams current mayor Steve Williams, but a very nice tribute to her because she

258
00:22:02,920 --> 00:22:04,120
Absolutely

259
00:22:04,120 --> 00:22:09,400
Thumped his ass the first time they ran against him beat him shit senseless

260
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:13,940
I hope he's listening to this because they really cheating beat the shit out of Steve

261
00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:20,480
And when she pat and he said that a few years later he saw her and

262
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:26,880
He was and he had like focused on some other stuff after he got beat and it had gone well for him

263
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:30,360
And he thanked her because if she hadn't beaten him so soundly

264
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:35,840
He wouldn't have been focusing on the stuff like business-wise that he wanted to focus on so it all works

265
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:41,960
I mean we all have different paths sure if your path is to be the mayor and his path is to be

266
00:22:42,800 --> 00:22:44,160
unseated by you

267
00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:48,560
It might work out for everybody in the end Steven Jean had a great relationship

268
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:55,120
Until our passing you could bet you could have that relationship just because you have different paths that happen to intersect

269
00:22:55,680 --> 00:23:00,960
You know and maybe he doesn't want a mayor anymore. You know he doesn't want to be the mayor

270
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:07,200
He has a record shop that sounds like kicks ass right yeah, and you're asking me Travis McElroy

271
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:10,640
would I rather deal with the day-to-day stresses of

272
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:13,280
running a city or

273
00:23:13,880 --> 00:23:17,220
Hang out at my super cool record store. Yeah

274
00:23:18,680 --> 00:23:19,960
I

275
00:23:19,960 --> 00:23:26,120
Think another sort of tact for this as you go to the mayor and say you got to be the mayor I

276
00:23:26,680 --> 00:23:29,560
Think it would be cool to be the mayor so it's my turn

277
00:23:29,560 --> 00:23:30,880
I

278
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:32,880
Would like a turn at mayor, please

279
00:23:33,800 --> 00:23:34,880
um oh

280
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:42,800
Yeah, walk out to him and symbolically like reach up right empty hands reach up to his head and say heavy is the head my friend

281
00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:46,440
I'll take it from here, please let me take the crown and then and so you're gonna

282
00:23:47,320 --> 00:23:53,340
Hey, this one's on me. You look so tired. You look so tired. You look like shit

283
00:23:53,340 --> 00:23:58,060
I'll take shit. This job is killing you. Hey, I'm gonna save your life

284
00:23:58,060 --> 00:24:03,780
You've aged 40 years in the last two my friend. Let me take over from here

285
00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:10,820
Can we talk about a town that's so small you could just decide to be the mayor, but can't support a record store

286
00:24:13,300 --> 00:24:18,540
It's a front for pot well, yeah, which it's a record store. That's right. Oh, yeah

287
00:24:18,540 --> 00:24:24,660
Fair enough. I just I think that when we all really think about we all look at our heart of hearts, right?

288
00:24:24,660 --> 00:24:28,700
I would say 99% of people who want to be the mayor

289
00:24:29,180 --> 00:24:31,420
Want to be the mayor so they can say they're in the man

290
00:24:31,420 --> 00:24:36,860
Not cuz all the hard work not cuz the change that want to implement no no no no it's the name

291
00:24:37,040 --> 00:24:42,300
So why not just say like hey, I'll be the mayor and you can be my vice mayor

292
00:24:42,780 --> 00:24:45,620
Yeah, and do the work and I'll be the mayor

293
00:24:45,620 --> 00:24:48,580
I want to I want to I want to challenge something

294
00:24:48,580 --> 00:24:54,760
I want to challenge the idea that being the mayor would look great on a resume because it does raise a central question

295
00:24:55,460 --> 00:24:59,260
All right, if you're the mayor and then you apply for a job

296
00:24:59,260 --> 00:25:05,620
Yeah, first first problem if you apply for a job while you are the mayor not great

297
00:25:06,140 --> 00:25:12,380
Great. Nope, not great second if you apply for a job after you're the mayor. Why aren't you the mayor? No more?

298
00:25:12,380 --> 00:25:15,740
Yeah, what hey, what happened? What happened there? No more

299
00:25:16,020 --> 00:25:24,060
Also, if you were a mayor and now you're applying to work at books a million or whatever like that seems to stay

300
00:25:24,060 --> 00:25:27,720
Why did you get out of politics? What happened? Was there a scandal? I'm going to assume

301
00:25:28,380 --> 00:25:36,100
Scandal definitely a scandal for sure a scandal. There are very few no matter where you look, especially in American politics

302
00:25:36,100 --> 00:25:41,740
I guarantee that there are very few politicians who reach any kind of like high-ranking level and then go

303
00:25:41,740 --> 00:25:45,940
Now I'm gonna go apply for jobs afterwards. Yeah

304
00:25:46,860 --> 00:25:49,660
Yeah, there's always something stinky in there in there

305
00:25:49,900 --> 00:25:56,180
There's always a little skeleton in the closet and the old mayor closet unless you're doing it unless you're only applying for jobs in

306
00:25:56,460 --> 00:25:57,700
the town

307
00:25:57,700 --> 00:25:59,700
That you were mayor of

308
00:25:59,820 --> 00:26:03,260
That feels like I could see that working out

309
00:26:05,260 --> 00:26:06,180
Um

310
00:26:06,180 --> 00:26:07,660
Man, it'd be cool to be the mayor

311
00:26:07,660 --> 00:26:11,980
You know, oh then if you apply somewhere else and they're like, hey, why are you the mayor anymore? You can just say like

312
00:26:11,980 --> 00:26:18,660
Oh my turn was done. My turn was on see that's what I'm saying. Let's break the stigma of losing at politics

313
00:26:19,180 --> 00:26:24,820
By just saying like everyone gets a turn like term limits is what you mean. I'm in favor

314
00:26:24,820 --> 00:26:27,660
Yeah, well Griffin, but like monthly. Oh

315
00:26:28,900 --> 00:26:32,460
Yeah, like get in there for a month and like get wild on it

316
00:26:32,460 --> 00:26:37,740
And I think this would break a lot of the gridlock, huh? If everybody's like we got a fucking month, right?

317
00:26:37,900 --> 00:26:39,140
Let's get it done

318
00:26:39,140 --> 00:26:44,720
Then there would reach a point though Griffin where and I don't know how long it would take before like, okay

319
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:50,100
We need somebody to do this now anybody are we out of people who want to do it?

320
00:26:50,820 --> 00:26:54,020
Are we gonna start back at the beginning of the list? Oh, man

321
00:26:54,020 --> 00:27:00,980
Um, hey, do you all want to approach the wizard? Yeah, please. Let me humble myself. Yeah

322
00:27:02,180 --> 00:27:07,060
Big so I can scare him. Oh Travis. Don't do that. Don't do that. Don't you late? I'm doing it. Oh

323
00:27:07,620 --> 00:27:13,100
Damn it. I'm gonna roll. He turned out 20 sweet potato. I love sweet potatoes

324
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:20,940
Well, this one was sent in by fucking Graham Roebuck. Thank you. Graham Roebuck. Just a platform agnostic treasure hunter

325
00:27:20,940 --> 00:27:26,420
It's like a Formula One racer comes and races at NASCAR like the hit film Talladega Nights

326
00:27:27,060 --> 00:27:29,060
exactly like that, so

327
00:27:29,260 --> 00:27:36,100
What we're looking at here is a this one's not peer-reviewed. Oh, I know that's important to some people

328
00:27:36,100 --> 00:27:40,300
It's gay, but it it is called how to live in a haunted house

329
00:27:41,100 --> 00:27:45,980
You just moved in and now you have really bad feelings about the place. Chances are the place could be haunted

330
00:27:45,980 --> 00:27:47,980
I mean it could be

331
00:27:47,980 --> 00:27:51,420
Any termites? Yeah, but it would be haunted

332
00:27:51,780 --> 00:27:53,340
Yeah, you may be frightened

333
00:27:53,340 --> 00:27:56,740
But don't be reading this article and can help you cope with the ghost presence

334
00:27:56,980 --> 00:28:00,420
Right in an awfully big check here at the top of the thing

335
00:28:00,780 --> 00:28:02,780
So very first thing guys

336
00:28:03,220 --> 00:28:07,540
Very first thing that is if you don't do this thing don't even think about living in a haunted house

337
00:28:07,580 --> 00:28:13,620
You got to take a well-built guard dog like German Shepherd with you into the house. What the fuck is that gonna do?

338
00:28:13,620 --> 00:28:19,820
The reason dogs easily detect the presence of spirits. It will be daring to you also with the dog

339
00:28:20,620 --> 00:28:23,820
Awesome. Yeah, but that's a dog. That's gonna work once

340
00:28:24,820 --> 00:28:30,900
Maybe the dog barks and the ghost goes whoa, and then goes oh wait. I'm a fucking ghost. I'm a ghost

341
00:28:30,900 --> 00:28:36,300
What are you gonna? Do this? Why does the size of why does it have to be a well-built guard dog like German Shepherd?

342
00:28:37,620 --> 00:28:41,600
When all it needs to do is since it's not gonna eat the ghost. It's not gonna get into a scuffle

343
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:43,480
Do you know what I mean?

344
00:28:43,480 --> 00:28:45,240
anyway

345
00:28:45,240 --> 00:28:52,120
Remind yourself before you move anything into the house walk through the entire place doing this will give the ghost and then in parentheses

346
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:57,640
s in case there's multiple ghosts a chance to scope you out and accept your presence in their home

347
00:28:57,760 --> 00:29:03,440
So just before you move anything in the house got to do a quick walk through so the ghosts get acclimated to your presence

348
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:09,260
But do have an enormous fucking gnarly dog in there with you that the ghost will feel

349
00:29:09,260 --> 00:29:14,860
Afraid of and then they'll know what it's like to be to feel that fear

350
00:29:14,860 --> 00:29:20,740
Well, that's assuming that the dog is acclimated to goes to right ghosts aren't scared of any of this. Yeah

351
00:29:21,660 --> 00:29:25,620
Nothing could scare. Yeah. I don't know why the first move is

352
00:29:26,100 --> 00:29:31,260
Intimidate the ghost when it should be like listen. You're gonna need to get that ghost on your side toot sweet

353
00:29:31,820 --> 00:29:35,300
Yeah, well the ghost's forgiveness beg your pardon ghost

354
00:29:35,300 --> 00:29:41,500
Yeah, sorry to get like a good cable package or something for the ghost do stuff with the ghost that the ghost can't do for

355
00:29:41,500 --> 00:29:45,940
Themselves, I'll open the blinds so you can see outside or something, right?

356
00:29:45,940 --> 00:29:51,620
I will open these this box of cheese. It's for you. You have the cheese. It's within I know you have trouble with the box

357
00:29:51,620 --> 00:29:57,020
I'll put in some scented candle. Can you smell okay? Is that thing ghost can still do? I don't know

358
00:29:57,020 --> 00:30:01,740
We're still getting to know each other. Ask the dog the dog knows

359
00:30:01,740 --> 00:30:07,140
Remember before moving all your stuff into the place move as few items as possible. This will avoid riling the ghosts

360
00:30:07,660 --> 00:30:13,980
To the changes going on in the transition from former occupants. Why not just ask? Hey, can I put the couch here?

361
00:30:14,620 --> 00:30:16,620
Where that couch come from?

362
00:30:16,820 --> 00:30:22,540
If I could put the couch here, it's gonna get less glare on the television that I bought for us for us

363
00:30:23,100 --> 00:30:26,660
Go so this is a this is a boiling the frog sort of

364
00:30:26,660 --> 00:30:34,460
like strategy for moving into a ghost house is if you go slow enough the ghost won't even notice that you're a different person ghosts are

365
00:30:34,460 --> 00:30:39,420
Also, very inconsiderate. Yeah, keep in mind while moving furniture other objects and be alert for any feelings

366
00:30:39,420 --> 00:30:41,420
You may have about where an item should be placed

367
00:30:41,860 --> 00:30:46,860
If you can make a ghost happy, but it goes happy by placing a chair in a particular place

368
00:30:46,860 --> 00:30:50,540
It could save you lots of trouble later on. Yeah, put it in the middle of the kitchen

369
00:30:50,540 --> 00:30:52,540
This is a sofa middle of the kitchen

370
00:30:52,540 --> 00:30:54,540
It makes me happy

371
00:30:55,140 --> 00:30:57,060
That makes me happy

372
00:30:57,060 --> 00:30:59,060
Refrigerator backyard, but what?

373
00:31:00,420 --> 00:31:02,420
Okay, oh

374
00:31:03,580 --> 00:31:07,500
Man, is the dog is the ghost pissed off? Yep. Where does it want it?

375
00:31:08,820 --> 00:31:10,820
Put the oven in your bedroom

376
00:31:12,300 --> 00:31:16,660
What I agree what's what's it boo, why did you say boo you're the dog

377
00:31:16,660 --> 00:31:23,460
Are you guys on the same side now? Oh, no, I've been infected. You can't get affected. No, I got it. I got ghosts

378
00:31:24,620 --> 00:31:29,740
Man man try to relate to the ghost by talking about what life might have been like in the house if it is an old

379
00:31:29,740 --> 00:31:34,340
House and try to do something former residents would have done in the house while they lived there like eating some meals in a formal

380
00:31:34,340 --> 00:31:40,140
Dining room or listening to period music from the town that time the house was built. There's no way the ghost wants that

381
00:31:40,660 --> 00:31:42,460
When was this house built?

382
00:31:42,460 --> 00:31:48,060
Looks like 1993. This is how we do it. This is my jam

383
00:31:50,060 --> 00:31:52,060
This is how we do it

384
00:31:52,540 --> 00:31:56,980
Try to talk about some big events that would have happened while past owners would have been living there

385
00:31:56,980 --> 00:32:00,300
For example on October 29th of a year try to talk about how past

386
00:32:00,700 --> 00:32:03,780
Residents would have felt about the stock market crash in the beginning of the Great Depression

387
00:32:05,100 --> 00:32:07,100
You're bumming me

388
00:32:07,100 --> 00:32:11,460
Haha, please tell me what's going on with the Kardashians

389
00:32:12,580 --> 00:32:18,220
It's so close to Halloween. That's like my jam, but the Great Depression. Yeah, it's such though

390
00:32:19,580 --> 00:32:23,460
I don't want to think of it. Do you want to think about when your fish died? It's

391
00:32:28,060 --> 00:32:31,540
Avoid the area the ghost is in if if they are in a particular place

392
00:32:32,020 --> 00:32:34,580
Try using the room as a storage area and leave the ghost alone

393
00:32:34,580 --> 00:32:39,420
so do you want me to fucking have dinner with it and play fucking this is how we do it and talk about the

394
00:32:39,420 --> 00:32:41,420
Great Depression or do you want me to like?

395
00:32:41,700 --> 00:32:47,540
Chill on it and leave them to wither and rot. You could also just like not walk through it

396
00:32:47,540 --> 00:32:52,520
It's not like that's a lot of these are just good rules for having a roommate

397
00:32:52,700 --> 00:32:57,940
Don't sit on your roommate ask your roommate where to put the furniture talk to your roommate. What would they like?

398
00:32:58,820 --> 00:33:03,340
Try to spend a night in the place some ghosts try to communicate with the living through dreams allowing the ghost to get its

399
00:33:03,340 --> 00:33:06,420
Message to the living may put an end to the haunting and send the ghost on its way

400
00:33:07,140 --> 00:33:14,340
Well, I'm going to sleep in my house. Yeah, so this one's gonna get done. No matter what are you sure?

401
00:33:14,340 --> 00:33:20,740
I should try the other shit before this. Thank you for sleeping here. My message is there's a carbon monoxide

402
00:33:23,420 --> 00:33:25,300
Except the ghost

403
00:33:25,300 --> 00:33:29,540
This may be difficult for some to do most ghosts will leave you alone if you acknowledge their presence

404
00:33:29,540 --> 00:33:35,260
Hey ghost except the ghost leave them alone have dinner with them dream about them, but I love you

405
00:33:35,460 --> 00:33:42,300
Don't you do this to me man? I love you. Don't say it if you don't mean it you heard me

406
00:33:42,380 --> 00:33:44,380
Yeah, fucking love you

407
00:33:44,620 --> 00:33:48,080
Talk to the ghost let it know it's welcome to stay if it leaves you and your family alone

408
00:33:48,860 --> 00:33:54,620
But remember if the ghost does something scary let it know you are upset and that if that such behavior continues

409
00:33:54,620 --> 00:33:59,800
It will not be tolerated. Okay. Yeah. Okay fucking tough guy back that up

410
00:34:00,180 --> 00:34:02,380
Hey back that up shit head

411
00:34:02,380 --> 00:34:06,540
This is shifted from what to do if you have a roommate to what to do if you move into a house and there's a big

412
00:34:06,540 --> 00:34:07,940
scary dog there

413
00:34:07,940 --> 00:34:12,860
Yeah, hey you just stay over there and I'll stay over here. No, don't growl at my kid or else what?

414
00:34:13,460 --> 00:34:15,620
We'll move. I'll kick your ass

415
00:34:17,420 --> 00:34:19,420
Probably not that though

416
00:34:19,420 --> 00:34:26,260
Can be persistently aggressed some ghosts and be persistently aggressive in this behavior may prevent you from sleeping or enjoying your home life the

417
00:34:26,260 --> 00:34:28,540
Way you deserve to if this happens never respond in anger

418
00:34:28,540 --> 00:34:33,780
This will only add fuel to the fire focus on feeling love for these entities that probably haven't felt love in a very long time

419
00:34:33,780 --> 00:34:40,420
If ever directing positive energy toward them can be surprisingly effective in stopping unwanted behavior. Okay, so that's the tip

420
00:34:40,420 --> 00:34:45,060
I need to get some sleep. Do you want to make out? Yes, please. Yes, please

421
00:34:45,060 --> 00:34:47,060
I

422
00:34:47,940 --> 00:34:52,100
Don't know why my ghost kind of sounds like Bane a little bit it does a lot

423
00:34:52,980 --> 00:34:57,740
Let's take a quick break and then we'll be our back after this brief trip to the money zone

424
00:35:07,180 --> 00:35:09,180

00:35:09,180 --> 00:35:16,820

426
00:35:16,820 --> 00:35:21,900
Okay, but it's a shame cuz Justin could really benefit from the application. Yeah question

427
00:35:21,900 --> 00:35:27,020
Well, that's what it takes him sometimes like 40 50 minutes to pee cuz he's gotta relax all his muscles and take a deep breath

428
00:35:27,300 --> 00:35:29,020
He could be gone for a while now

00:39:36,040 --> 00:39:39,560
Host of the town I was just toast of the town

476
00:39:40,840 --> 00:39:45,120
Turn that frown upside down. It's the crypt host of the town

477
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:51,800
Why you ain't gonna need an actuary to know this news ain't deflationary. It's the

478
00:39:54,120 --> 00:39:55,920
Of the

479
00:39:55,920 --> 00:39:57,640
cryptost of

480
00:39:57,640 --> 00:40:04,360
The town I still don't understand what crypt toast of the town a lot going on here Griffin. Yeah

481
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:08,000
host of the town and crypto toast of the town and

482
00:40:08,340 --> 00:40:13,400
Justin please and so he's combining them like a portmanteau, but bad

483
00:40:14,120 --> 00:40:19,080
Okay, but I don't know if he's taking us into a crypt. I understand. There's no crypt. There's no

484
00:40:19,080 --> 00:40:25,600
Crypto Justin, please I'm explaining it cryptocurrency thing and he's gonna eat toast. I think okay

485
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:31,840
No toast isn't part of it toast. Oh, yeah. No toast is definitely part of it. Definitely gonna be named. Yes. Yeah

486
00:40:32,520 --> 00:40:35,400
You said crypt toast of the town. Why would you say toe?

487
00:40:35,960 --> 00:40:37,520
toast of the town

488
00:40:37,520 --> 00:40:41,720
Where I tell you the latest in the world of cryptocurrency now

489
00:40:41,720 --> 00:40:47,960
I do a serious Bitcoin analysis show on tick-tock. This is not that this is for fun

490
00:40:47,960 --> 00:40:49,960
Okay. Yeah, and then we talk about toast

491
00:40:51,080 --> 00:40:55,160
Toast ain't part of it. I'm pretty sure it is because I don't know if you guys

492
00:40:56,160 --> 00:41:02,000
What's your guys? I need to know your real-world awareness of cryptocurrency Elon Musk made up some money

493
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:04,720
Fucking nothing. Okay good

494
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:08,560
Cuz here's this story is that do you guys know about alt coins?

495
00:41:09,040 --> 00:41:12,600
No, so all coins are kind of like spin-offs of the good

496
00:41:12,600 --> 00:41:18,560
Cryptocurrency, huh, which in and of itself is kind of questionable, right? It's great. It's cryptocurrency Knights

497
00:41:19,520 --> 00:41:21,400
Yeah, so

498
00:41:21,400 --> 00:41:23,180
the celebrities

499
00:41:23,180 --> 00:41:26,200
Because it's tough to make these rise above the den

500
00:41:27,320 --> 00:41:31,600
Celebrity and it's like really it's momentum based right like you remember what happened with those coin

501
00:41:31,600 --> 00:41:38,360
Oh where everybody's like doge, I love it. Let's get on board everybody buy a bunch and it's like wow, this is really expensive

502
00:41:38,360 --> 00:41:43,440
What's it for nothing? Okay, so they get celebrities to try to pump these up, right?

503
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:46,360
So Logan Paul has been pushing one called ding

504
00:41:47,120 --> 00:41:48,800
Huh?

505
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:51,360
No, no, you need to say that again, but

506
00:41:53,520 --> 00:41:55,520
It's called

507
00:41:57,920 --> 00:42:02,760
That's a coin that Logan Paul is pushing dink don't know it's not Justin

508
00:42:02,760 --> 00:42:08,240
It's a crypto meme. It's a meme coin. It's a mean coin called ding-dong

509
00:42:08,320 --> 00:42:11,440
It's a main point called ding-dong because nothing means nothing no more

510
00:42:11,440 --> 00:42:15,120
I didn't mean it's just a mean coin called ding-dong

511
00:42:15,480 --> 00:42:18,800
Cool, and that's pretty impressive as exciting

512
00:42:19,080 --> 00:42:26,340
But I that's not the celebrity coin that we're worked up about this week on cryptos of the town

513
00:42:27,240 --> 00:42:29,840
And I actually have the announcement here

514
00:42:29,840 --> 00:42:31,840
Oh, it's boop, it's boop-doop

515
00:42:31,840 --> 00:42:39,000
It's not boop-doop. It's uh, it's even better. I have the announcement here. Okay, I've actually brought them into the studio

516
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:41,000
What a thrill this is. You ready? Yeah

517
00:42:42,240 --> 00:42:49,320
The Stanley nickel token better known as the nickel token has officially launched on Uniswap and pocket swap

518
00:42:49,920 --> 00:42:53,640
Nickel is an ERC 20 token on the aetherium blockchain

519
00:42:53,640 --> 00:43:01,080
Including deflationary and frictionless yield mechanics. This means you earn more tokens

520
00:43:01,080 --> 00:43:04,800
Just by holding and the supply is constantly decreasing

521
00:43:05,640 --> 00:43:08,000
Raising the value of the remaining tokens

522
00:43:08,600 --> 00:43:14,360
Nickel is a utility token with a charitable basis rewarding holders with future NFTs

523
00:43:15,120 --> 00:43:17,400
memorabilia collectibles and addition

524
00:43:17,400 --> 00:43:25,320
So none of that is words. So here's the thing about it, you know Stanley from the office and how everybody loves Stanley

525
00:43:25,320 --> 00:43:32,240
Yeah, you you remember the great own footlander Stanley. You know the great episode with shrewp bucks

526
00:43:32,240 --> 00:43:34,240
Yeah, everybody loves those

527
00:43:34,320 --> 00:43:41,680
Stanley in that episode said I got a Stanley nickel and someone saw that and they thought I'm gonna do a real one

528
00:43:41,680 --> 00:43:45,560
I'll do a money on that. I'm gonna do a money all about that

529
00:43:45,560 --> 00:43:49,360
so the this is a the Stanley nickel is

530
00:43:50,360 --> 00:43:52,360
Leslie David Baker's

531
00:43:52,480 --> 00:43:59,480
Cryptocurrency that he I guess he you could tell from that that he did created himself and he hand coded it

532
00:43:59,720 --> 00:44:05,980
Obviously and that's Stanley from the office's money that he made up from the TV that comedy TV show The Office

533
00:44:06,080 --> 00:44:08,080
Yeah, but he can buy it

534
00:44:08,520 --> 00:44:12,540
Like and you can buy it and it's just out there, you know what I mean?

535
00:44:12,540 --> 00:44:18,420
Yeah, okay. Can I tell you my problem with cryptocurrency Justin you have a problem with cryptocurrency that doesn't seem possible

536
00:44:18,420 --> 00:44:23,980
It's all up side man. No, here's here's what it is. It's just it's very mechanical and practical which is they

537
00:44:24,860 --> 00:44:28,980
Invented currency, which is fine. That's how currency was invented in the first place, but then they also

538
00:44:29,940 --> 00:44:37,820
Invented all the words and all of the mechanics to talk about they couldn't at least have started from a place of vocabulary

539
00:44:37,820 --> 00:44:42,700
I can understand. It's friction. It's frictionless. It's frictionless. What does that mean?

540
00:44:42,700 --> 00:44:49,020
Does that mean I can slide it across a table forever because otherwise I don't know what the fuck it means. No, it's imaginary

541
00:44:49,020 --> 00:44:53,820
They won't actually. It's not real. Yeah, it is charitable. Some of the profits from this go to the

542
00:44:54,320 --> 00:44:55,780
Sorry, the actual fund which is cool

543
00:44:55,780 --> 00:45:01,260
He said in there and I want to really zoom in on one part of this that proves that it's not made up in fake

544
00:45:01,260 --> 00:45:04,500
Good, because I'm in the weeds right now. I need help

545
00:45:04,500 --> 00:45:07,820
He's the part where he says that it is

546
00:45:09,540 --> 00:45:12,180
It has yield mechanics sure

547
00:45:16,080 --> 00:45:23,200
You earn more tokens just by holding now and the supply is constantly decreasing so you earn

548
00:45:24,180 --> 00:45:32,220
You earn more. Oh, it's by holding it at least the one Justin and then the supply is decreasing. So I

549
00:45:32,220 --> 00:45:39,300
I don't that actually should make sense to you if you're in this. Yeah, you start so there's a hundred circulating, right?

550
00:45:39,300 --> 00:45:42,740
And then they kill one person who holds one. So now

551
00:45:43,260 --> 00:45:49,660
The 99 people remaining have a little bit extra and they just keep killing people one by one until eventually

552
00:45:50,020 --> 00:45:52,700
One person's token is worth a hundred

553
00:45:52,700 --> 00:45:59,660
It's worth all of them and they can go to a Subway sandwich restaurant and get a big sandwich for their fake office money

554
00:45:59,660 --> 00:46:03,100
It's six inches the best we could so I guess

555
00:46:03,660 --> 00:46:07,700
The reason I wanted to do this bit, which I don't think will be recurring is

556
00:46:08,620 --> 00:46:12,620
The guy who played Stanley on the office. Uh-huh. Mm-hmm

557
00:46:13,260 --> 00:46:15,940
Made a cryptocurrency and why haven't we?

558
00:46:16,820 --> 00:46:23,740
About a scene he did on the office one time called Stanley Nichols that you can buy and spend your money on and

559
00:46:23,740 --> 00:46:31,020
It's deflationary yield me obviously on the Ethereum blockchain. I hope of these I believe is on the Ethereum blockchain

560
00:46:31,020 --> 00:46:33,100
and guess what I'm what I'm saying is like

561
00:46:35,060 --> 00:46:39,720
Where do we go? Yeah from here because

562
00:46:40,420 --> 00:46:46,620
The idea that the guy what played Stanley would do a cryptocurrency about Sally Nichols is

563
00:46:46,620 --> 00:46:54,180
On my I feel like there is a lawsuit. It's hot that list of things kind of got ahead of us

564
00:46:54,180 --> 00:47:01,380
Maybe a few episodes in the future. We'll do this bit and they kind of stole it the idea from us

565
00:47:01,380 --> 00:47:04,780
I would write I have an idea Justin. I think you're right

566
00:47:05,420 --> 00:47:07,420
Everybody would be at dink-dink

567
00:47:08,540 --> 00:47:10,540
Stanley Nichols donkey-donk

568
00:47:10,540 --> 00:47:16,420
Um donkey lips whatever everybody's doing cryptocurrency. Why don't we do?

569
00:47:17,100 --> 00:47:18,580
Get this

570
00:47:18,580 --> 00:47:25,060
Classic currency. We're gonna start printing money and I've been doing I've been doing blacksmithing Justin

571
00:47:25,060 --> 00:47:30,980
You've been doing woodworking we can make our own coins and just declare that they are worth money

572
00:47:31,620 --> 00:47:37,360
Right. Okay. Ooh, can I twist that up a little bit? Yes, please. Can I twist that up a little bit?

573
00:47:37,360 --> 00:47:42,420
Yeah, we print that money, right? But it looks nearly

574
00:47:43,220 --> 00:47:45,220
indiscernible from US

575
00:47:45,520 --> 00:47:49,180
tinder, okay US currency dollars and cents and

576
00:47:49,740 --> 00:47:56,240
If we get caught and people are like, are you forging money? Nope, then we can say no

577
00:47:56,420 --> 00:47:59,720
This is dink doing this is a currency baby

578
00:47:59,720 --> 00:48:07,180
This looks like a fake $100 bill that you printed on a inkjet printer. That is black and white

579
00:48:07,180 --> 00:48:10,520
Yep, and you say that's how you know, it's dink doing baby

580
00:48:10,520 --> 00:48:16,680
I'm not going to this is dink doing too. I'm not going to jail for you or anybody. Yeah, I'm

581
00:48:17,240 --> 00:48:22,180
Guys, I'm trying to hang in here with you. Yeah, I really am trying to hang in here with you

582
00:48:22,320 --> 00:48:25,800
But just as I was about to move on to the next thing

583
00:48:25,800 --> 00:48:30,640
Oh, and I should also say dink doing too is it's gold stamp like it's backed by gold

584
00:48:30,640 --> 00:48:34,360
You can turn you in anywhere for gold. You gotta

585
00:48:35,760 --> 00:48:38,600
Just as I'm ready to like move on to the next bit

586
00:48:38,600 --> 00:48:44,960
I saw that screenshot I sent earlier and I sent you a picture from a real movie

587
00:48:45,520 --> 00:48:51,960
About the mask and Danny DeVito penguin and mr. Freeze and agent Smith watching Don Cheadle watch

588
00:48:51,960 --> 00:48:56,760
LeBron James and Bugs Bunny play basketball and I don't know it feels like a

589
00:48:57,280 --> 00:49:02,520
Photoshop that one of our fans made up about one of our great skits, right? Like what this is the same episode?

590
00:49:02,520 --> 00:49:05,660
What do we do? Like what things are outpacing us?

591
00:49:06,040 --> 00:49:10,920
Reality is outpacing. I tell you what's bothering me about this picture Justin if you look over

592
00:49:11,280 --> 00:49:18,140
Like if you follow back Don Cheadle to penguin to maybe Alexis Rose. I don't know

593
00:49:18,140 --> 00:49:22,720
I don't want to do jokes about a picture. No one can see yeah, we'll post it. Oh my god

594
00:49:22,720 --> 00:49:24,960
That is Alexis from Schitt's Creek

595
00:49:27,600 --> 00:49:31,480
Anyway, um, so I'm kind of having a little bit of a crisis about this

596
00:49:31,480 --> 00:49:36,720
I don't know what our I don't know what our contribution is to the culture at this point at this point

597
00:49:36,720 --> 00:49:38,720
I'm not classic currency

598
00:49:39,520 --> 00:49:41,520
So we can kind of

599
00:49:41,520 --> 00:49:48,160
Circle back around and get less weird. Oh, you know, yeah, we'll start back at the beginning baby trade economy

600
00:49:48,160 --> 00:49:51,640
I'll give you one goat you give me two bushels of grain

601
00:49:52,480 --> 00:49:58,300
Charlie it travels. She's coming Charlie. Did you just call that should give you a secret hint of the tone that's approaching

602
00:49:58,680 --> 00:50:04,520
Yeah, we we have never really been a sort of currency focused enterprise

603
00:50:04,520 --> 00:50:08,960
I don't know why we need to circle back around earth on the currency front

604
00:50:08,960 --> 00:50:12,760
I'm talking like in the currency of ideas the original currency

605
00:50:14,160 --> 00:50:16,760
We need to it needs we need to like

606
00:50:18,040 --> 00:50:22,040
Get less weird right like we need to somehow

607
00:50:23,080 --> 00:50:30,280
Like become the MacNeil layer news hour. Oh, you're saying everyone else is getting so weird that it's like maybe the new thing

608
00:50:30,920 --> 00:50:35,800
Maybe the thing that we could do is be like now we do fresh air

609
00:50:35,800 --> 00:50:37,800
Oh

610
00:50:37,940 --> 00:50:42,020
Yeah, yeah, yeah, that's awesome. Well, we've already got movie reviews you can use

611
00:50:42,380 --> 00:50:46,020
Let's delete the first 12 minutes of this episode then where we talk

612
00:50:46,900 --> 00:50:52,040
Enthusiastically about space jam 2 and in fact, let's just try actually this is great. This is a great way to end the show

613
00:50:52,540 --> 00:50:56,660
Okay, let's try the intro again, but talk about space jam 2

614
00:50:57,140 --> 00:50:59,420
Like we don't like we're not excited about

615
00:51:00,860 --> 00:51:02,860
We can do that we can do that, okay, okay, okay

616
00:51:02,860 --> 00:51:05,060

A good show. Yeah, Terry grosses next show is called brother zone

620
00:51:24,380 --> 00:51:30,920
Fresh brother fresh brother. Okay. No, I'll figure it out. It doesn't matter a touch of brother

621
00:51:30,920 --> 00:51:32,920
No

622
00:51:33,800 --> 00:51:35,800
Really so bad at this

623
00:51:37,440 --> 00:51:42,140
Meeting of them of them on of the great man. You're trying to get clever and it needs to be like

624
00:51:43,320 --> 00:51:45,320
More boring. Yeah, you're right

625
00:51:46,680 --> 00:51:48,680
Pod chat

626
00:51:49,040 --> 00:51:51,040
Podcasts. Hey, okay. Yeah

627
00:51:51,660 --> 00:51:58,480
Hello and welcome to the podcast chat show a show hosted by me Justin McQuarrie my two brothers

628
00:51:58,480 --> 00:52:06,340
Travis and Griffin on today's episode. What are we gonna be discussing griffin Griffin McElroy today?

629
00:52:07,200 --> 00:52:09,200
discussing the

630
00:52:10,480 --> 00:52:12,480
Disgracefully zany

631
00:52:13,040 --> 00:52:15,040
Major motion picture

632
00:52:15,280 --> 00:52:16,640
space jam

633
00:52:16,640 --> 00:52:22,840
To space jam a new legacy now Travis they've been trying to get this one made for quite some time

634
00:52:22,840 --> 00:52:24,680
Is that right some stops and starts?

635
00:52:24,680 --> 00:52:32,560
Yes, it's been in the works for about 25 years now and I I think it shows because it really reflects the mentality of the

636
00:52:32,840 --> 00:52:35,600
geopolitical culture that existed back in

637
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:44,880
1996 when it was conceived and I don't think that it accurately reflects the current culture of the time. I

638
00:52:45,880 --> 00:52:52,400
Need to step in here and say please one point in the film an old

639
00:52:52,400 --> 00:52:54,400
Old

640
00:52:54,440 --> 00:53:01,080
Let's say nemesis to civility reared his head and I am talking about Austin Powers

641
00:53:01,560 --> 00:53:05,020
and when he arrived on the scene, I

642
00:53:05,640 --> 00:53:07,640
started to

643
00:53:07,680 --> 00:53:09,680
Throw up

644
00:53:09,800 --> 00:53:11,800
Because of how

645
00:53:12,680 --> 00:53:20,800
Absolutely wild and unexpected. This is a children's film about rabbit who can dunk a basketball and

646
00:53:20,800 --> 00:53:24,680
And Austin Powers is a rival on the scene

647
00:53:26,200 --> 00:53:30,920
Talking about his genitals and how much he loves to

648
00:53:31,760 --> 00:53:33,880
Fornicate now made me

649
00:53:34,880 --> 00:53:36,880
barf up the

650
00:53:37,520 --> 00:53:42,020
It made me barf up weird. It made me barf up the plain soup by eight now

651
00:53:42,160 --> 00:53:47,160
As as you know, I do not allow my children to watch movies let alone

652
00:53:47,160 --> 00:53:53,320
consume any form of media and I never will right how I become but the

653
00:53:53,760 --> 00:53:58,080
The idea that somewhere down the line they might be talking to a human being

654
00:53:58,440 --> 00:54:02,240
Who has seen this movie and they would recount this scene in which?

655
00:54:02,920 --> 00:54:07,500
Austin Powers discusses his genitals. It makes me vomit

656
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:12,120
The right thousand oyster crackers I consumed this morning on a dare. I

657
00:54:12,120 --> 00:54:17,800
Also ate a thousand moisture crackers this morning, but they were unsalted. Of course

658
00:54:17,800 --> 00:54:21,780
I ate a picture of a thousand oyster crackers

659
00:54:23,720 --> 00:54:25,440
That was

660
00:54:25,440 --> 00:54:27,440
tasteless and odorless, but it was

661
00:54:27,960 --> 00:54:33,820
That's what my doctor told me to do for my various conditions. How big was the picture? Did you find it filling?

662
00:54:34,520 --> 00:54:36,800
It was a delicious picture. I

663
00:54:36,800 --> 00:54:43,920
I the I didn't appreciate when Austin Powers appeared in the screen my children

664
00:54:44,480 --> 00:54:46,480
Obviously have no friend or preference

665
00:54:47,160 --> 00:54:53,620
Any of his and they of course asked me who he was? Oh, just I wish sorry

666
00:54:54,160 --> 00:54:58,280
Of course, they would though if you're the makers of this film you have to expect it

667
00:54:58,280 --> 00:55:03,160
I then had to explain to my children about the British sex female

668
00:55:03,160 --> 00:55:05,160
And

669
00:55:05,840 --> 00:55:12,120
How he was basically a British a British man who has also

670
00:55:12,920 --> 00:55:14,920
Had the soul of Shrek

671
00:55:15,520 --> 00:55:22,000
In him confusing for my child as well. It is upsetting to me that they have the opportunity to include Shrek in

672
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:26,280
This film who we all love. Oh, yes, of course

673
00:55:27,560 --> 00:55:29,880
Shrek is good. He's the modern Hamlet

674
00:55:30,360 --> 00:55:31,840
but

675
00:55:31,840 --> 00:55:34,980
No, that was a no. No that think you just said

676
00:55:35,960 --> 00:55:38,280
That was weird. If I think you misspoke and

677
00:55:40,840 --> 00:55:46,880
Say a normal thing, please of course the universal worldwide sex symbol Shrek whom we all

678
00:55:50,320 --> 00:55:54,120
Know okay. Let me try one more time. No more fun, please

679
00:55:54,120 --> 00:56:00,360
Please no more the Republican icon Shrek

680
00:56:04,360 --> 00:56:06,800
After the break dink doing we hate it
