1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:30,640
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:50,000
Ladies and gentlemen, it's pretty hot out there. Check the thermostat, rising the mercury,

6
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:56,960
squeezing up like so much red toothpaste out of a tube. Who's ready to party with summer jams?

7
00:00:56,960 --> 00:01:01,440
Welcome to MBMBAM, home of the worst metaphors in town.

8
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:06,720
K-M-M-B-M-B-A-M, your one stop shop for summer classics.

9
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:09,040
Hey Beach Babies, how's your bikinis?

10
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:13,680
Hey Beach Babies. How's your termites?

11
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:15,360
You guys like CeeLo Green?

12
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:21,360
Tune in as we workshop new characters like Hey Bikini Babies, how's those bikinis guy?

13
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:26,640
Nothing but coolers and babes, that's all.

14
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:34,240
Crack open a nice cold beer, and we'll find a butt like Shalala.

15
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:43,440
Make sure to join us at McGillicuddy's deck for party on McGillicuddy's deck.

16
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:45,680
To the sequel.

17
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:48,640
Party your deck off at McGillicuddy's.

18
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:50,880
Get your deck wet.

19
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:55,520
Come get your deck wet with $2 smushers plushes all night long.

20
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:03,840
The hottest babes, the hottest guys, the drunkest children.

21
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:05,680
The wildest monkeys.

22
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:08,880
The craziest poop throwing monkeys you've ever seen.

23
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:14,160
And good news ladies, margaritas are just $3 all night long.

24
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:16,080
Monkeys getting free till midnight.

25
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:23,120
Hey monkey it's 1230, come on in anyway, it's McGillicuddy's.

26
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:27,520
21 and up for male monkeys, 18 for female monkeys.

27
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:30,480
I don't even know if monkeys live that long, what the fuck?

28
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:37,600
Half man half monkeys will be submitted for study at research institutes nationwide.

29
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:41,840
So Summer's here, Summer's here again.

30
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:46,000
Summer, my worst enemy.

31
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:50,480
Do you know what doesn't go well?

32
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:54,080
Two chemical compounds that in nature just do not collude.

33
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:55,280
What's that Griffin?

34
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:56,960
That's Griffin McRoy in shorts.

35
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,840
They are magnetically opposed.

36
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:05,200
You know what I think that is, in my opinion?

37
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:09,840
It's a mental block that you're having because no one looks good in shorts.

38
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:15,760
That's not entirely true, early 2000s Jessica Simpson.

39
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:17,920
Well that's different.

40
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:23,200
She had like a, there was a three month window where one person looked good in shorts.

41
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:26,640
That's not, that's the exception that proves the rule, please.

42
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:31,040
So shorts, I'm with you on that, but I've given up.

43
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:33,920
That's the thing, that's the thing you have to do.

44
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:37,760
So now you wear a utilikilt, which is I think the sartorial,

45
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:40,400
the sartorial equivalent of giving up.

46
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:46,480
Listen, I don't want to be, I don't want to come down and get on people in utilikilts

47
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:49,920
that those people have had enough to deal with.

48
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:53,920
But they probably could have come up with a better name to not make it so ridiculous, but go on.

49
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:55,520
Yeah, I think that's the point though, isn't it?

50
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:58,400
What about dirty skirts?

51
00:03:59,200 --> 00:03:59,840
What don't they call that?

52
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:01,040
Dirty skirty.

53
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:02,240
Dirty skirt.

54
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:06,720
What about just like cargo pants, but without the thing in the middle?

55
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:08,800
Yeah, legless cargo pants.

56
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:12,320
Plaid legless cargo pants.

57
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:14,400
One big pocketed leg.

58
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:20,000
So as you've certainly guessed, this is My Brother, My Brother, and Me,

59
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,400
and it's an advice show for the modern era.

60
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:25,120
I am your oldest brother, Justin McElroy.

61
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:27,360
I am your middle-est brother, Travis McElroy.

62
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:29,840
I am your youngest brother, Griffin McElroy.

63
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:34,880
And we're here to dole out the advice to you, take your queries,

64
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:37,760
and turn them alchemy-like into wisdom.

65
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:38,960
So let's just dip in.

66
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:43,680
I order Chinese food from the same place every other week or so.

67
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:47,440
Every time it comes, it's the same guy delivering it to me,

68
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:53,120
and recently I've noticed my order has had more things like fortune cookies and all in it.

69
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:56,080
Recently, I even found a bottle of juice I didn't order.

70
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:59,920
He's really cute and is usually friendly and chatty when he delivers the stuff.

71
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:04,720
Is this sudden extra food his way of flirting, and how should I respond?

72
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:07,520
For the record, I am gay, so no problems there.

73
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:10,720
Why did you have to read that last part like that?

74
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:13,200
There's an exclamation point at the end.

75
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:16,080
So that's, I'm just, I'm just reading with the text.

76
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:20,000
But you didn't think that all homosexual people talk like that all the time?

77
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,680
No, no, I wouldn't say that.

78
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:22,960
That's from Hungry and Awkward.

79
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:25,600
So can you guys help, you guys know I'm gender blind.

80
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:28,800
Can you guys help me understand the genders in this situation?

81
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:30,480
They're both men.

82
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:31,360
They're both gentlemen.

83
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:33,440
Well, I don't think I'll say gentlemen.

84
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:35,840
I don't know, you know, their habits and proclivities.

85
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:36,880
I know that they are men.

86
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:40,800
Are, do we know that the question asker is a man?

87
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:41,120
Yes.

88
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:41,360
Yeah.

89
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:42,480
How do you know?

90
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:48,480
Because, so man, I kind of took it to read, no, no problems there.

91
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:50,080
Like, nothing can come of it.

92
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:54,720
Oh, see, I know that they are a man because I read all the emails and I know that this had

93
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:56,160
a male name attached to it.

94
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:57,280
Okay, let's roll with that.

95
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:59,040
See, that's the kind of context clues I really like.

96
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:02,000
Now wait, are you sure that it was a male name?

97
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:04,720
A male name applied to a male.

98
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:05,440
Ooh.

99
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:06,960
I have to assume so.

100
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:07,520
All right.

101
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:08,960
You don't have to assume anything.

102
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:11,600
Assuming makes an ass out of you and Ming the Merciless.

103
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:14,800
This is so sexy already.

104
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:16,480
This is getting really hot in here.

105
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,280
A few things to consider.

106
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:25,280
First off, you are entering into a dangerous situation because in wanting to see this gentleman

107
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:29,520
more, you're going to order more Chinese food and that's not going to help you get your health

108
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:29,840
right.

109
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:32,800
Yeah, and that's also not really sexy for this dude.

110
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:36,480
Like, he's like, you eat Chinese food like nine times a day.

111
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:38,160
I can barely care for myself.

112
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:43,280
I'm basically Meals on Wheels over here.

113
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:53,040
I mean, don't we have a strict anti-workplace to customer dating rule against that thing?

114
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:54,640
Especially with, well, no.

115
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:56,480
Not in 2012.

116
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:59,920
I was about to say, especially when that person is forced to come to your house.

117
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:01,680
He knows where you fucking live, dog.

118
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:07,680
Like, if this goes down and he goes full-blown swing fan, you will have no recourse.

119
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:09,920
I have a question for you.

120
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:12,080
How much do you like this Chinese food?

121
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:16,880
Are you willing to risk having a relationship with this person and then not being able to

122
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:19,440
order your favorite black pepper chicken anymore?

123
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:23,520
What is important to you?

124
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:25,360
Like, where are your priorities at?

125
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:29,600
Maybe this place is the only place that makes, like, every other place makes a crab rangoon

126
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:30,080
too sweet.

127
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:33,120
And this is the one that's always a problem.

128
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:33,520
It is.

129
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:34,160
That's a problem.

130
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:35,360
Here's the thing.

131
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:40,480
What I love is, if this is the case, if this gentleman is flirting with you, I love that

132
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:43,440
he's like, I'm just going to slip a bottle of juice in there.

133
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:44,240
He'll know what's up.

134
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:48,400
That's a weird, it is a weird flirt.

135
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:54,400
Although I've been ordering from the same Chinese place, the China Garden on 8th Street,

136
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:59,840
right across the street from the former biker bar, the Valhalla Club.

137
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:02,720
Oh, and a catty corner to Jeff's bike shop, if I remember correctly.

138
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:04,080
Yeah, right around that neighborhood.

139
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:08,000
So if you're ever in Huntington, now you know where all those things are.

140
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:12,960
Yeah, if you need a bike fixed or a place that used to be a biker bar and now isn't.

141
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:15,600
It's a block and a half down from City Hall.

142
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:16,880
Right, exactly.

143
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:17,840
That helps you place it.

144
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:23,120
I order from this place and I'd say seven out of ten times when we order,

145
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:29,120
there is a tub of brown chicken-y something.

146
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:30,560
And on top-

147
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:31,520
Question sauce.

148
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:35,040
The word, no, no, no, there'll be stuff in it.

149
00:08:35,040 --> 00:08:37,120
And on the top is written the word free.

150
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:41,760
Hey, this is free.

151
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:44,320
I'm not going to tell you about the contents of it.

152
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:45,520
It's free.

153
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:47,280
This hate meat is priced to move.

154
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:49,840
By which we mean nothing.

155
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:50,960
Did you want to eat this?

156
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:54,000
These are our drippings.

157
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:54,960
They're all yours.

158
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:58,160
I got you some chicken cracklins and they're free.

159
00:08:58,160 --> 00:08:58,960
Don't question it.

160
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:00,240
So that is to say, I don't know.

161
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:06,080
I used to order the Chinese and get, he would bring like in a paper bag and

162
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:10,960
when I dig to the bottom of the bag, there are always two cans of soda in there that I did not

163
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:17,840
like ask for, but like it was part of like a meal deal and it was always like diet cherry seven up.

164
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:19,440
Yeah, nothing you would ever consider.

165
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:20,560
Yeah, my fridge-

166
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:21,920
Coffee flavored Faygo.

167
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:28,320
My fridge is littered with a bunch of like diet tangerine Fanzas.

168
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:31,280
And it's like, I don't know, maybe someday someone will come to my home

169
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:32,320
who will want to drink this.

170
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:33,680
I feel bad just chucking it.

171
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:36,000
Now it's a collector's item.

172
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:42,560
There's a, the place I, this is embarrassing, but the place I order from China Garden again,

173
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:45,680
the same guy is always there.

174
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:54,000
And this guy has a, I would say, let's say fundamental understanding of the English language.

175
00:09:54,000 --> 00:10:00,400
But here is the one thing that he does really, really well is his spiel when you order.

176
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:05,520
So it gets to this point where it is so practiced and rehearsed.

177
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:13,600
This man says the exact same things with the exact same intonation every single time.

178
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:18,560
And while at first it was very strange, it became-

179
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:19,840
Comforting.

180
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:22,960
Weirdly, it became weirdly comforting.

181
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:23,600
That's like a level-

182
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:26,320
To know that in this crazy world, there's always that one pillar you can rely on.

183
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:28,240
There's this one guy I can call.

184
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:30,640
I can call, and then it became even worse.

185
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:35,840
Like then I started feeling really guilty because it's like I'm, my main thing I like

186
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:39,200
about this guy in the way, is the way in which he is kind of like a robot.

187
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:42,960
He's a serve, like a serve, serve machine.

188
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:45,040
And it's not, it's not fair of me.

189
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:50,400
I have felt that level of trust and familiarity that one might feel for a lover for maybe

190
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:54,480
one restaurant my entire life.

191
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:59,200
It was Hot Locks Cool Sushi in Chicago.

192
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:03,440
And it was right across the street, down the corner, around that corner, and then down

193
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:04,320
a little bit more.

194
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:05,520
And it was so good.

195
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:06,640
It was the best food.

196
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:10,800
And I, they were family to me, you know?

197
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:15,200
And I just don't, I don't think I could ever jeopardize that for any reason.

198
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:16,800
Guys, I shit you not.

199
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:23,280
In my phone, I have countless friends and family, and I have one restaurant number saved

200
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:23,920
in my phone.

201
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:24,880
Can I guess?

202
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:25,280
Yeah.

203
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:26,320
Is it Gino's?

204
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:28,720
No, it's China Garden Buffet.

205
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:32,000
And I haven't lived in Huntington for three years.

206
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:32,480
Yeah.

207
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:34,560
I've changed phones twice.

208
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:41,200
And also, just so I'm clear to visitors of Huntington, future visitors of Huntington,

209
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:45,600
China Garden's probably like the, like the fourth best.

210
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:49,040
Yeah, I saw you leaning towards third and I was gonna nudge you back.

211
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:50,080
It's not good.

212
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:53,840
Like, you wanna go to, if you want buffet, you're gonna go and wanna go out to Barbara's

213
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:55,040
Building and get a super China buffet.

214
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:57,520
Or you can hit Taste of Asia.

215
00:11:57,520 --> 00:12:00,880
Taste of Asia has Thai and Japanese and Chinese.

216
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:03,200
Or Thai House, if you just want, if you just want Thai.

217
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:04,560
If you want something fancy, go Hibachi.

218
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:07,600
Yeah, yeah, it's the fifth, okay, I'm sorry.

219
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:09,840
It's the fifth best place you can go.

220
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:12,960
But they're the only place that delivers to me, and I really like this guy.

221
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:13,840
I mean-

222
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:17,200
Okay, so here's the thing, question, ask her to jump back.

223
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:19,280
I've been thinking about it while we've been BSing.

224
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:25,760
And I would say that if, here's like a little addendum to our, you know,

225
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:31,200
don't flirt with someone at a place of business, especially if it involves tipping.

226
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:36,960
Because you can confuse how much they like, how well you tip and give you extra stuff

227
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:40,880
and like sneak you extra drinks and stuff for flirting.

228
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:46,320
But they're playing up the tip, and it's ambiguous enough that I would say don't risk it.

229
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:50,240
Don't risk it, because I feel the same way at a bar, you know, where it's like,

230
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:52,560
I tip well so the bartenders are all really like me.

231
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:56,000
That doesn't mean they're craving my wave, you know?

232
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:57,280
Sure, sure.

233
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:00,720
Do you guys want a Yahoo answer?

234
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:02,320
Yes.

235
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:03,040
Yeah?

236
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:08,080
This one was sent in by T-Dollar Sign, which I pronounce T-Money.

237
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:09,600
I thought it was T-Dollar.

238
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:10,640
T-Dollar!

239
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:11,360
Thank you, T-Dollar.

240
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:14,960
It's by Yahoo Answers user, oh, Ned has a big penis.

241
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:19,840
Oh Ned, you are such a character.

242
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:23,440
Can I high five a driver in an oncoming vehicle?

243
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:29,600
Sometimes when I drive with my windows down, I have an uncanny urge to high five

244
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:31,520
other drivers with their window down.

245
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:34,400
Let's say we're traveling around 35 to 40 miles an hour.

246
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:38,560
If I were to extend my hand out for this celebratory gesture and engage the driver

247
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:40,320
traveling in the opposing direction.

248
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:41,920
Oh, I love these kinds of questions.

249
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:46,880
Also traveling around 35 to 40 miles an hour, would said hands break leaving us to be exchanging

250
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:49,280
high fives with our right hands in the emergency room?

251
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:54,960
Okay, this is one of those circumstances in which we have to talk about the difference

252
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:56,880
between can and may.

253
00:13:57,520 --> 00:13:58,320
Right.

254
00:13:58,320 --> 00:13:58,880
Can you?

255
00:13:59,520 --> 00:13:59,920
Maybe.

256
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:01,200
May you?

257
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:02,000
No, you may not.

258
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:02,880
No, I'm sorry.

259
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:10,320
I think this, I don't think there's like a safe speed for this.

260
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:17,520
Like part parked, I guess you could do high fives there, but what's the point?

261
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:18,960
Yeah, right.

262
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:20,240
That's not like exciting.

263
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:25,200
The impact has got to be crazy, right?

264
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:30,720
In high school, when we were in driver's ed class, they told us that they told us that

265
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:40,080
if you had a tissue box in the back of your car and you were in a and you ran into a white

266
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:46,560
a wall at going 35 miles an hour, that you would, that you would die.

267
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:48,720
Because the tissue box would become a fly.

268
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:53,520
Are those two things connected or is it like, oh, what you're saying is it's like an omen.

269
00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:55,120
There's a tissue box in the car.

270
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:57,280
It's like seeing a raven, you're going to die.

271
00:14:57,280 --> 00:15:02,320
I'm saying that they told us the tissue box would fly forward with such velocity that

272
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:04,560
it would kill you, that it could kill you.

273
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:09,440
So this was your driving teacher slash gym instructor, right?

274
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:11,280
This was a man who sat outside the school.

275
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:13,360
This is something an old boy would do.

276
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:15,760
Beware the tissue box, kids.

277
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:19,600
It's how we lost my second and fifth wife.

278
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:25,920
We can all agree that high fives are, you rate them.

279
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:32,960
The metric for the value of a high five is how like hard, hard you do it and how loud

280
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:33,680
the smack is.

281
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:35,040
Yeah, it's how epic the smack is.

282
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:39,920
I literally, the other day I high fived my friend Linnea and the smack, the high five

283
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:45,200
was so like loud and thunderous that we high fived again to celebrate that high five.

284
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:49,760
It's hard to high five Travis because he has, I would say a beefy hand.

285
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:51,920
Oh yeah, this thing, oh God.

286
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:54,560
It's very, it's deep.

287
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:56,240
It's enriched, you know?

288
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:03,360
It's hard to get a satisfying smack with you because usually I pull back a little bit in

289
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:04,160
fear.

290
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:05,600
That's fair, that's fair.

291
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:07,120
Sure, you're terrified.

292
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:08,240
You fear the power.

293
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:13,520
Can we also agree that going 35 miles an hour and high fiving somebody else going 35 miles

294
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:18,400
an hour, that smack, that smack could cleave the world in two.

295
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:20,160
Like it's gonna be amazing.

296
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:22,640
You can see the sound waves coming off of it.

297
00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:27,280
Are you suggesting that it would be worth it to lose your hand to create a high five

298
00:16:27,280 --> 00:16:28,080
heard around the world?

299
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:33,200
I'm all about like doing something that nobody on the planet has ever done.

300
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:35,840
I don't know that anybody's, somebody's probably done this before.

301
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:39,680
This seems like something like Travis Pastrana and Johnny Knoxville have done.

302
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:40,320
Yeah.

303
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:42,640
Those kinds of stupid morons.

304
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:47,120
Or two rural kids who watch a lot of Jackass.

305
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:50,240
After ghost riding the whip, they then high fived each other.

306
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:50,740
Sure.

307
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:55,120
I don't know if it'll break your hand or not.

308
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:59,760
Well yeah, I think it'll definitely break your hand because you'll want to move through.

309
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:01,440
Even at like 10 miles an hour?

310
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:05,520
Yeah, I think so because you're still going.

311
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:07,360
Like that's the thing is it doesn't stop there.

312
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:09,600
You're not gonna have time to hit and pull back.

313
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:10,080
You know what I mean?

314
00:17:10,080 --> 00:17:11,920
I think it's exponential though, right?

315
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:18,800
Like if I'm running at you at 10 miles an hour, that's about my speed.

316
00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:21,280
And you're running at me 10 miles an hour.

317
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:23,360
You think you run at 10 miles an hour?

318
00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:25,360
That's not a very good speed, Justin.

319
00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:25,860
What?

320
00:17:26,320 --> 00:17:28,000
I think you can probably run faster than that.

321
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,080
Babies run at 10 miles an hour.

322
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:36,160
But I'm saying if you are doing a running high five and you high five somebody, that would be safe.

323
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:37,600
Why would it be different in the car?

324
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:42,400
Aside from the fact that like you are definitely engaging in some unsafe driving practices.

325
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:44,320
Yeah, that's the other thing.

326
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:48,240
Okay, they don't tell you in driving school to put your hands out the window,

327
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:49,840
slapping another man's hand and two.

328
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:52,720
So hold on one second.

329
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:56,480
I need to pause the episode so I can watch an episode of Beakman's World to find out if this

330
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:57,600
is a good idea or not.

331
00:17:57,600 --> 00:17:58,400
Hold on.

332
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:00,640
All right, we'll catch up with Travis in 30.

333
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:06,320
Nope, a man in a giant rad suit just told me this is a fucking stupid ass idea.

334
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:07,760
Are there any responses?

335
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:11,520
Did anybody weigh in?

336
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:12,480
Some science teacher?

337
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:15,760
There's always, I find that whenever somebody has a question like this on Yahoo Answers,

338
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:20,400
there's typically, not always, but typically some self-important science teacher that feels

339
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:24,560
like he has to, like this is the kids in his class to listen to him.

340
00:18:24,560 --> 00:18:27,920
So maybe the kids on Yahoo Answers will dig his facts.

341
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:31,520
Like, hey, this is kind of a relevant example, the kids of today.

342
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:32,880
That makes science cool.

343
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:36,640
And somebody's linked to like the St. Petersburg Herald or something of like,

344
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:39,280
man loses arm in tragic high-fiving accident.

345
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:45,760
Actually, in this case, we get a Yahoo Answers user, I'm really tall, account two.

346
00:18:46,560 --> 00:18:49,120
Apparently account one was compromised.

347
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:51,120
No, he's so tall he needs two accounts.

348
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:53,040
He says, stretch out.

349
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:56,000
Nope, I've done this before.

350
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:00,080
If you're both doing it at 40 miles an hour, then it will just sting.

351
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:03,840
If you both throw your hand forwards while you're driving 40 miles an hour,

352
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:05,120
then you might break your hand.

353
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:07,760
Source, high fives oncoming cars.

354
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:10,640
Wait a minute, hold on.

355
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:14,400
The 40 miles an hour you're driving in a car won't break your hand.

356
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:20,960
But if you give it that extra umph of your own body, that's like, that's a thin line, right?

357
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:22,480
Well, I guess it's the give, right?

358
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:26,720
Because you can high five somebody and then let your arm just sort of like go back.

359
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:27,760
Here's the problem.

360
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:30,080
Once this gets solved, it's going to escalate.

361
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:33,760
And pretty soon kids will be trying to do a thumb war at 40 miles an hour.

362
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:35,600
Yeah, that, I mean, that's the fear, isn't it?

363
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:38,480
You go up to high five somebody, but they grab onto your hand.

364
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:41,520
You're both pulled through your windows as your cars fly out.

365
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:44,720
You do kind of a windmill action.

366
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:46,160
Yeah, you spin around in the air.

367
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:51,600
Guys, I just got the best idea for Wanted 2, the movie.

368
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:52,400
I'll be right back.

369
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:56,240
I have to, I have to update my spec script.

370
00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:03,200
Angelina Jolie and oncoming Brad Pitt.

371
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:04,080
Yeah, we got him.

372
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:08,320
Slow down momentarily as they grasp hands.

373
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:09,760
Their eyes meet.

374
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:17,200
They are wrenched from their vintage 1962 car.

375
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:21,280
There is a, there is a WordPad document open on Justin's computer right now

376
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:22,640
that just says vintage on it.

377
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:30,800
I'll wake up out of this, out of the heroin induced haze that I'm in right now

378
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:34,480
in 72 hours and think, why did I write vintage?

379
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:35,440
That doesn't make sense.

380
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:38,960
I just typed vintage and then there's a picture of Angelina Jolie

381
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:41,920
pasted into Microsoft Paint.

382
00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:42,640
What was I doing?

383
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:46,080
Guys, I don't know if you know this, but we have a very, very special sponsor this week.

384
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:47,120
It's the IFC.

385
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:49,280
They're promoting their new show, Comedy Bang Bang.

386
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:53,280
It starts this Friday, June 8th at 10, 9 central on the Independent Film Channel.

387
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:54,720
Check your TV guide, find it.

388
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:56,880
The first episode has Amy Poehler.

389
00:20:56,880 --> 00:21:00,320
The show is hosted by Scott Aukerman, who is absolutely hilarious.

390
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:04,560
You can watch the first episode before it goes live on IFC.com right now,

391
00:21:04,560 --> 00:21:08,080
or just go to the Comedy Bang Bang IFC Facebook page and see it there.

392
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:11,840
It's comedy so nice, they banged it twice.

393
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:16,320
And it's going to have people like Amy Poehler, Zach Galifianakis, Seth Rogen,

394
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:17,280
just to name a few people.

395
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:18,720
So, so go check it out.

396
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:20,320
I just started at uni.

397
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:22,000
God, guys, come on.

398
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,600
You are going to college.

399
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:27,440
This is an American show for everybody in the world.

400
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:30,560
So can we please call it what everybody in the world calls it, college.

401
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:31,840
Adult school.

402
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:37,040
I just started at big boy school and I'm trying to make new friends there.

403
00:21:37,040 --> 00:21:41,440
But I feel like if I try approaching any girls, they would feel creeped out

404
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:42,720
or like I was hitting on them.

405
00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:47,360
I have a long-term girlfriend, so I'm not even interested in that way.

406
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:48,720
Should I be worried about this?

407
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:51,120
And if not, how do I shake this feeling?

408
00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:54,080
That's from girlfriends, not girlfriend.

409
00:21:56,400 --> 00:22:00,400
Number one, you're in college now and that makes them women.

410
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:01,600
Yes.

411
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:05,360
So say it like that.

412
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:05,840
Don't.

413
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:08,000
And then they'll know you're not hitting on them.

414
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:11,120
Hello, women or ladies.

415
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:12,720
Hello, ladies.

416
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:13,120
Women.

417
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:16,160
Are there any females?

418
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:18,080
Are there any women here?

419
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:23,360
I'm just a 21st century man looking for some women.

420
00:22:24,160 --> 00:22:29,200
My friend Daniel said, hey, Dylan, go talk to those girls.

421
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:32,160
And I said, Daniel, those are not girls.

422
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:33,760
They are women.

423
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:38,480
So women, anyone care to prove me right?

424
00:22:39,040 --> 00:22:42,720
So women, anyone seen the latest episode of Doctor Who?

425
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:45,520
I think-

426
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:48,320
Isn't it a shame what they're doing to community?

427
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:49,680
Let's be best friends.

428
00:22:49,680 --> 00:22:51,760
Does anyone want to try some absinthe?

429
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:54,800
We are in college after all.

430
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:57,120
Definitely not uni.

431
00:22:57,120 --> 00:22:59,040
Can I interest anyone in an orgy?

432
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:05,120
You're gonna have a problem not creeping anyone out.

433
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:07,840
It's like you talk like that.

434
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:09,600
Why are you talking like that?

435
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:14,240
I feel like all college freshmen are just big balls of creepo.

436
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:18,480
And they don't know how to talk to people.

437
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:23,120
And it's not a personal problem as much as it is a community's problem,

438
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:24,320
a social problem.

439
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:27,280
Because everybody's like just as terrified as you are.

440
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:28,240
And you know, here's the thing.

441
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:31,120
Like I'm a person who is not terrified and very outgoing.

442
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:33,520
And I'll like walk right up to someone and start a conversation.

443
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:35,680
And I did that in college and thought I was just killing it.

444
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:38,240
And everyone's like, oh, Travis, he's annoying.

445
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:39,840
He's really, really weird.

446
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:41,520
It's on everybody's nerves.

447
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:42,000
Yeah.

448
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,560
So like you literally can't win.

449
00:23:44,560 --> 00:23:47,040
Like either you're sitting in a corner afraid to talk to everyone,

450
00:23:47,040 --> 00:23:49,280
or you're talking to everybody and you're an asshole.

451
00:23:49,280 --> 00:23:52,240
So it's like it's so hard to walk that fine line.

452
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:55,440
But I think what will help is that you have a girlfriend.

453
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:58,480
You literally are not interested in them in that way.

454
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:02,240
And if they're willing to like even give you a chance,

455
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:04,560
that kind of thing comes across really quickly.

456
00:24:04,560 --> 00:24:05,840
And I don't think you have to worry about it.

457
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:07,120
Here's the problem though.

458
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:11,760
He's in a committed relationship with a long-term girlfriend,

459
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:16,400
which makes him irresistible to women.

460
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:17,680
I don't think that's true.

461
00:24:17,680 --> 00:24:20,800
Well, we've talked about this before though.

462
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:23,280
That's because he's not trying.

463
00:24:23,280 --> 00:24:25,600
That's because there's like no stakes.

464
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:29,600
And that is very attractive when someone is not putting it out there.

465
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:30,960
But that's the problem though.

466
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:33,200
This guy's walking into these situations, right?

467
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:36,480
With the confidence of somebody who is already in a relationship.

468
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:39,040
Which is making him irresistible.

469
00:24:39,040 --> 00:24:40,640
This guy's basically asking,

470
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:46,720
how do I get put into the quote unquote friend zone?

471
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:48,560
As distasteful as I typically am.

472
00:24:48,560 --> 00:24:50,000
That's not a real thing.

473
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:53,600
But that's a really great thing because we get asked all the time,

474
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:55,760
like how do I get out of the friend zone?

475
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:56,560
I love this.

476
00:24:56,560 --> 00:24:59,040
Like how do I put myself in it?

477
00:24:59,040 --> 00:25:02,080
How do I not get all the pussy is what he's asking.

478
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:06,480
Guys, I'm just going to be inundated with all of these vaginas.

479
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:08,000
They got so much trim.

480
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,080
They got it to give, but I don't want it.

481
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:10,960
Don't need it.

482
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:11,360
Know how.

483
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:12,080
Keep it ladies.

484
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:15,520
I don't think it's that ubiquitous.

485
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:18,880
I think this is a bigger problem other than just genders.

486
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:22,000
And it's how do you make friends with anyone ever anywhere on the planet?

487
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:26,320
I don't think you should flatter yourself so much by saying,

488
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:29,840
I don't want all these women to think I'm trying to, you know,

489
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:32,800
Dr. Suave on them and then they know they like they,

490
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:36,160
I'm afraid that they're just going to come at me too much.

491
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:38,240
If that's a problem, it's probably not a problem.

492
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:41,360
No, I think he's saying that he's afraid that they're going to think

493
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:44,320
he's creeping on them when really he's just trying to make friends.

494
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:47,760
But I would say that that is once again, as you said, Griffin,

495
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:49,840
universal and not just for one gender.

496
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:51,840
I think anybody, if you just roll up and you're like,

497
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:53,440
hey, let's be best friends now.

498
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:55,200
They're going to be like, uh, no.

499
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:59,760
The only way you make friends in college is A, you have classes with them.

500
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:01,760
And then you just sort of bond there.

501
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:08,960
Or B, you have like this friend with this impossibly magical charm to them

502
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:12,480
who brings you friends, like some sort of loyal dog.

503
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:12,880
Yes.

504
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:19,040
So if you can hang out with Michael Bradbury or Trevor David or me, you'll be fine.

505
00:26:19,040 --> 00:26:19,920
I, well.

506
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:22,320
Yeah, no, I'm very charming.

507
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:23,680
It might surprise you to learn, Griffin,

508
00:26:23,680 --> 00:26:25,360
that I'm actually a very charming person.

509
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:26,480
That's something all charming people say.

510
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:29,040
We're all very self-aware.

511
00:26:29,040 --> 00:26:31,840
Now, usually we don't pull back this curtain and tell everyone about it,

512
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:35,760
but I got special permission for this occasion to let you guys know.

513
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:36,800
Is it like a curse?

514
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:38,160
Is it like-

515
00:26:38,160 --> 00:26:39,440
It's a blessing and a curse.

516
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:40,000
You know how like-

517
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,480
We talk about it at all the meetings at Charming Anonymous,

518
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:45,120
which I really shouldn't be telling you about because it defeats the purpose.

519
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:48,480
It's like if you say Rumpelstiltskin's name, he loses all of his power.

520
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:53,680
It's like if you ever see Travis eat anything, then he loses his magic charm.

521
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:57,520
Yeah, that's why I eat so quickly to try to get it over with as fast as possible.

522
00:26:57,520 --> 00:26:59,840
I don't actually think that's why you eat so quickly.

523
00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:01,440
I'm almost certain it is.

524
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:05,360
I think you eat so quickly because you're excited to have the food and you don't-

525
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:09,440
And that is also why if you try to take my plate away, I will bite your hand.

526
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:10,320
Yeah, sure.

527
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:14,400
Sometimes Griffin has to put this rubber ball in my food so I don't gulp it,

528
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:15,920
because then I'll get a tummy ache.

529
00:27:15,920 --> 00:27:22,240
Hey, that was funny when you guys were talking just now.

530
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:24,320
Justin, you gotta step-

531
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:25,680
Welcome back to the show, Justin.

532
00:27:25,680 --> 00:27:28,000
You gotta step on board.

533
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:29,040
I really did.

534
00:27:29,040 --> 00:27:32,960
For the last two minutes, I've been a listener of My Brother, My Brother, and Me.

535
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:37,920
Actually, to be more technical, My Brother, and Me,

536
00:27:37,920 --> 00:27:41,920
not to be confused with the hit Nickelodeon kid-com, My Brother, and Me.

537
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:44,880
So welcome back.

538
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:45,840
So I'm back now.

539
00:27:47,680 --> 00:27:48,160
How about a Yahoo?

540
00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:49,200
I just thought that part was funny.

541
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:52,080
I'm gonna tell people about that part.

542
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:57,600
Guys, you gotta listen to this bit on my favorite podcast that I happen to be on.

543
00:27:57,600 --> 00:27:59,040
Here's a Yahoo answer.

544
00:27:59,040 --> 00:27:59,840
Okay.

545
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:01,680
This Yahoo was sent in by David Myers.

546
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:02,720
Thank you, David.

547
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:03,680
Hey, thanks, David.

548
00:28:03,680 --> 00:28:06,640
It's by Yahoo Answers user Nosy C, who asks,

549
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:10,480
I am telling my dad the truth about my boyfriend's age on Sunday.

550
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:12,160
How can I start the conversation off?

551
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:14,800
I am 17, and he's 23.

552
00:28:14,800 --> 00:28:16,720
My dad thinks he is 20.

553
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:18,960
What can I say to him to start the conversation off?

554
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:20,960
What?

555
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:22,960
What?

556
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:29,360
There's a three-year age difference, and you're worried about, I mean, is that a massive difference?

557
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:31,840
No, no, there's a six-year, there's a six-year age difference.

558
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:35,920
No, no, but there's a three-year difference in your dad's perception and reality.

559
00:28:35,920 --> 00:28:40,880
I like that this person is 17 and started dating this 23-year-old, and she was like,

560
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:43,680
okay, I'm going to have to lie to my dad about the age.

561
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:45,920
He's never going to buy 18.

562
00:28:45,920 --> 00:28:47,280
Let's split the difference.

563
00:28:47,280 --> 00:28:48,240
Yeah.

564
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:51,280
What's the most believable lie I could possibly...

565
00:28:51,280 --> 00:28:58,880
He's not going to buy 17, because my boyfriend has a full beard for that job, so 20?

566
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:02,480
The dad probably knows already, the dad was probably like,

567
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:05,120
hey, can you rent me a car in a couple of years?

568
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:06,560
I'm thinking of going on a trip.

569
00:29:06,560 --> 00:29:08,160
Like, oh, yeah, no problem, Mr.

570
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:09,120
God damn it.

571
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:10,880
God damn it.

572
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:11,680
God damn it.

573
00:29:11,680 --> 00:29:14,240
The dad was talking, he was like, hey, how about Smurfs, son?

574
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:15,280
He's like, yeah, I love those.

575
00:29:15,280 --> 00:29:16,160
I knew it.

576
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:16,880
Yeah.

577
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:17,680
Damn it.

578
00:29:17,680 --> 00:29:20,320
Gargamel always getting into it.

579
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:28,080
He would give him the first half of Great Bits from Cheers, and he would finish them.

580
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:29,280
Sam and Diane, huh?

581
00:29:29,280 --> 00:29:31,040
When are they ever going to get together?

582
00:29:31,040 --> 00:29:32,240
I know, right?

583
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:33,920
I think you got to...

584
00:29:33,920 --> 00:29:37,920
I mean, all right, first off, you got to lie.

585
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:40,560
You got to lie.

586
00:29:40,560 --> 00:29:45,120
That's such a stupid thing to lie about, that it's going to be not only frustrating for your dad,

587
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:48,080
it's going to be embarrassing for you.

588
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:49,280
You got to lie.

589
00:29:49,280 --> 00:29:53,200
Can you say that he went on some sort of time travel adventure,

590
00:29:53,200 --> 00:30:01,680
and while we were stuck in time, moving along the time stream, normally he aged super fast?

591
00:30:01,680 --> 00:30:04,400
Now, you can do that, but it's going to take some commitment.

592
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:08,000
You got to start with, my boyfriend has decided to join the Air Force.

593
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,960
Then you work your way up to, he's become an astronaut.

594
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:16,960
Then he gets shot into space, and breaks the speed of light.

595
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:18,880
And then when he returns, he's aged three years.

596
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:21,680
So it's going to take you two or three years.

597
00:30:21,680 --> 00:30:24,080
All those AP physics classes really paid off for you.

598
00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:26,720
Do we do more believable and maybe topical?

599
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:29,040
Like maybe he gets involved with the SpaceX program.

600
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:34,000
He goes up in Dragon, Jesus sees that someone besides the government

601
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:40,480
is using time travel, and he punishes them by making them age faster than normal.

602
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:44,560
He got a weakened case of progeria.

603
00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:45,360
Right.

604
00:30:46,160 --> 00:30:47,440
He beat it though.

605
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:48,720
He beat the progeria.

606
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:56,080
What about like a whimsical scavenger hunt that ends with parental disappointment?

607
00:30:58,160 --> 00:31:01,840
Like you leave clues, and the dad has to follow the clue to the next clue,

608
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:06,000
and then at the end is just a picture of the boyfriend's driver's license.

609
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:11,760
That's good, because most scavenger hunts are engines for the child's disappointment,

610
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:14,400
and it's nice to pass the buck for once.

611
00:31:17,920 --> 00:31:19,040
Is the dad going to care?

612
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:20,480
I mean, if I was a dad.

613
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:22,480
You are not the dad of a teenage girl.

614
00:31:23,680 --> 00:31:26,720
I'm sure it makes you crazy a little bit, turns you into a crazy person.

615
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:34,400
Wouldn't it be great if these two crazy kids had been together for like five years?

616
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:38,080
No, that would be very highly unpleasant,

617
00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:42,320
because at that point you're talking about an 18-year-old dating a 12-year-old.

618
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:44,160
Oh no, oh no, I didn't do the math.

619
00:31:44,160 --> 00:31:45,760
I was thinking of 20, and oh no.

620
00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:46,560
Yeah, no, you did bad.

621
00:31:46,560 --> 00:31:48,000
I've done this poorly.

622
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:48,800
I did it bad.

623
00:31:48,800 --> 00:31:50,080
I did math in a bad way.

624
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:53,040
I used math for evil.

625
00:31:53,040 --> 00:31:58,800
I used math for evil.

626
00:31:58,800 --> 00:32:02,400
I mean, it's easier to ask for forgiveness than permission, right?

627
00:32:03,280 --> 00:32:03,840
Yeah.

628
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:05,360
Talk to everyone in prison.

629
00:32:05,920 --> 00:32:08,240
Why does your dad ever need to know how old this person is?

630
00:32:09,920 --> 00:32:11,280
Is it because they're out of school already?

631
00:32:11,280 --> 00:32:12,320
Doogie Howser.

632
00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:14,480
Whatever, just keep the lies coming.

633
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:19,360
If you're married, if they get married, and they live together, and they stay married,

634
00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:25,280
and then he dies pretty early, and your dad, who is inexplicably still alive,

635
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,800
it's like, man, I thought he had a few more years left in him.

636
00:32:28,800 --> 00:32:30,240
And you're like, what, three years?

637
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:31,520
I've got a big secret, dad.

638
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:33,360
Daddy, I'm sorry.

639
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:34,240
Get ready.

640
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:35,120
Get ready, dad.

641
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:36,720
He was actually 97.

642
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:37,220
Fuck.

643
00:32:37,680 --> 00:32:39,040
You're 133.

644
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:41,440
I did math bad.

645
00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:44,080
I'm so glad you're still alive, Megadad.

646
00:32:45,520 --> 00:32:46,560
Get over here, Psydad.

647
00:32:46,560 --> 00:32:47,840
Come here, Methusadad.

648
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:48,240
I love you.

649
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:50,640
Come here, bicentennial dad.

650
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:52,560
I love you so much.

651
00:32:54,320 --> 00:32:54,820
Shit.

652
00:32:55,280 --> 00:32:59,520
Why do all of our goons have to terminate with references to Robin Williams 2?

653
00:32:59,520 --> 00:33:04,800
Because he's a robot, Justin, that gets operations done so he can fuck humans.

654
00:33:04,800 --> 00:33:06,720
That's the best movie ever made.

655
00:33:09,040 --> 00:33:12,160
It's Robin Williams as a super boned out robot.

656
00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:17,120
His metal flange ain't gonna cut it no more.

657
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:18,960
Put a human dick down there, please.

658
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:22,560
I don't see why that was acceptable.

659
00:33:22,560 --> 00:33:27,920
Yet my spec script for Small Wonder got me summarily laughed out of Hollywood.

660
00:33:27,920 --> 00:33:30,640
I don't understand why that wasn't okay, you know?

661
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:31,360
She's a robot.

662
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:34,080
She doesn't have an age, technically.

663
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:35,680
Did yours have Oliver Platt in it?

664
00:33:36,400 --> 00:33:36,960
It did not.

665
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:37,440
Well, there's your problem.

666
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:43,360
Maybe just have her boyfriend reference Small Wonder and then the dad knows that he's old as shit.

667
00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:43,840
Yeah, sure.

668
00:33:44,400 --> 00:33:46,000
What does the dad care?

669
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:47,680
The dad's gonna fucking care.

670
00:33:47,680 --> 00:33:50,080
If I was a dad of a girl, of a woman.

671
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:50,960
Nope, she's 17.

672
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:51,520
Still a girl.

673
00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:54,000
Not yet a woman.

674
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:56,400
Not yet, not even yet a woman.

675
00:33:56,400 --> 00:33:58,800
And she was dating an 18 year old.

676
00:33:58,800 --> 00:34:01,440
I think the high school college split is a big deal.

677
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:04,400
I would say 20 is a big deal because soon he's gonna be drinking,

678
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:07,840
buying all kinds of Smirnoff ice at Boon's farm for my sweet princess.

679
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:09,120
23?

680
00:34:09,680 --> 00:34:11,680
They have been drinking Boon's farm.

681
00:34:11,680 --> 00:34:13,680
They are familiar with all the flavors.

682
00:34:13,680 --> 00:34:15,120
Could you do it incrementally?

683
00:34:15,120 --> 00:34:16,320
I'd be like, hey, dad, really?

684
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:17,680
He's 20 and a half.

685
00:34:17,680 --> 00:34:18,400
Okay.

686
00:34:18,400 --> 00:34:21,280
And then like the next day be like, he's 21.

687
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:23,040
The next day, like he's 20 in two months.

688
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:26,400
A good thing to do to old people is to say like,

689
00:34:27,360 --> 00:34:33,760
is to reveal your lie by the fact that they were confused.

690
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:37,760
So he'll say, I thought he was, I thought Jeremy was 20.

691
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:39,840
You say, nah, he's 21.

692
00:34:39,840 --> 00:34:41,120
Like he's always known that.

693
00:34:41,120 --> 00:34:43,040
Or maybe, oh fuck, I've got it.

694
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:45,200
I've got it, I've got it.

695
00:34:45,200 --> 00:34:46,400
Frequent birthdays.

696
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:48,400
Dad was having the same idea.

697
00:34:48,400 --> 00:34:51,120
21 in April, 22 in June.

698
00:34:51,680 --> 00:34:52,180
Yeah.

699
00:34:52,720 --> 00:34:54,960
Your dad will never be able to keep track of that.

700
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:58,000
He can't even like keep up with his fantasy football team.

701
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:58,400
I guess he's like-

702
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:01,040
No, you're gonna have to change all the clocks and calendars in the house.

703
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:01,520
Wow.

704
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:02,880
It's gonna take a lot of commitment.

705
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:06,000
No, like he'll have a birthday in April.

706
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:07,120
He'll turn 21.

707
00:35:07,120 --> 00:35:07,760
Okay.

708
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:11,040
And then in September, he has birthday too.

709
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:13,360
Where he turned and he'll turn 22 and your dad would be like,

710
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:15,520
didn't he just have his birthday?

711
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:16,480
No, September 11th.

712
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:16,800
Remember?

713
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:18,000
He was born on September 11th.

714
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:18,480
It's like a thing.

715
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:19,440
You said you wouldn't forget.

716
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:20,960
You said you wouldn't forget his birthday.

717
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:21,680
That's not good.

718
00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:24,080
And then the next birthday, the final birthday is April 1st.

719
00:35:24,080 --> 00:35:25,440
You're like April Fool's Day.

720
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:26,160
Don't you remember?

721
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:27,360
You're so stupid, dad.

722
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:28,320
That's so stupid.

723
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:29,280
You're the April Fool.

724
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:30,560
Hey, get out of my life.

725
00:35:30,560 --> 00:35:32,880
But then you forget that he has a real birthday.

726
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:34,800
You gotta sneak it in one week after.

727
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:37,360
You gotta sleep your dad like three or four Ambien.

728
00:35:37,360 --> 00:35:39,280
So he just like wanders through the day in a haze.

729
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:40,480
He clunks out.

730
00:35:41,680 --> 00:35:43,280
This sounds totally healthy.

731
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:43,840
Hey.

732
00:35:43,840 --> 00:35:45,040
This sounds like the movie Click.

733
00:35:47,360 --> 00:35:48,480
Is this what that movie's about?

734
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:49,360
This movie is Click.

735
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:51,280
This movie is Click.

736
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:54,160
That's the tagline for Click.

737
00:35:54,160 --> 00:36:02,960
Well, if you like that ad, you're going to love the money.

738
00:36:14,560 --> 00:36:18,640
This message is for Alex Long from Christina Elias.

739
00:36:18,640 --> 00:36:19,440
Here's the message.

740
00:36:20,560 --> 00:36:22,720
Their anniversary is May 27th.

741
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:26,400
And they have, which is today, right now as we're recording this,

742
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:28,160
and they've been together for two years.

743
00:36:28,160 --> 00:36:30,640
He's made a huge impact on my life.

744
00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:32,560
And since we listed the show together every week,

745
00:36:32,560 --> 00:36:36,480
a shout out from the brothers is the best anniversary present I could think of.

746
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:38,720
So happy anniversary, Alex.

747
00:36:39,360 --> 00:36:41,760
I love you so much.

748
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:43,520
You need to say, Alex, I love you too.

749
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:46,960
Alex, I'm in love with you.

750
00:36:47,600 --> 00:36:49,280
Alex, I'm 23.

751
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:51,120
I'm sorry.

752
00:36:51,120 --> 00:36:52,080
I'm sorry.

753
00:36:52,080 --> 00:36:53,840
So happy anniversary, you two.

754
00:36:53,840 --> 00:36:57,680
I'm so glad that, hey, Alex, go ahead and make an honest woman out of her.

755
00:36:57,680 --> 00:36:58,400
Whoa.

756
00:36:58,400 --> 00:37:01,600
I love how this is what it always becomes.

757
00:37:01,600 --> 00:37:02,640
Great taste in pie.

758
00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:03,600
That's married people.

759
00:37:03,600 --> 00:37:05,120
Married people want everybody to get married.

760
00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:08,240
Does that like lower the rates?

761
00:37:08,240 --> 00:37:09,040
How does that work?

762
00:37:09,600 --> 00:37:14,400
Yeah, you get a discount at a married restaurant.

763
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:16,080
At Bed Bath and Beyond.

764
00:37:16,080 --> 00:37:17,120
Let's be honest.

765
00:37:17,120 --> 00:37:17,680
Let's move on.

766
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:20,960
Travis, tell me about Mob Rules games.

767
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:25,360
Well, Mob Rules games, as you know, like we're ending our month long sponsorship with them.

768
00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:28,080
We've come a long way, baby.

769
00:37:29,360 --> 00:37:29,860
Ew.

770
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:30,820
Yep.

771
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:32,960
Well, how about we've come a long way, baby.

772
00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:36,720
We've come a long baby way.

773
00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:37,220
Yeah.

774
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:37,940
Okay.

775
00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:42,960
And so they're still working on their Kickstarter over at mobrulesgames.com.

776
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:43,680
Go check it out.

777
00:37:44,240 --> 00:37:45,440
We're about halfway there.

778
00:37:46,240 --> 00:37:47,680
So make sure you're still giving to them.

779
00:37:47,680 --> 00:37:51,280
Five dollars gets you a code to download the game when it's complete in October.

780
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:53,200
It's incredible looking.

781
00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:54,720
So make sure you check it out.

782
00:37:54,720 --> 00:37:58,000
Also, we want to make sure that we mentioned before we left off with them.

783
00:37:58,720 --> 00:38:04,160
They're doing a podcast called I believe it's the Pod Macabre.

784
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:07,680
So make sure that you check that out on their website.

785
00:38:07,680 --> 00:38:09,600
And so head to Mob Rules.

786
00:38:10,240 --> 00:38:15,280
Basically, it's a diary of what they're doing and all the horror movies that influence the game.

787
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:18,080
So make sure you check that out on their website.

788
00:38:18,080 --> 00:38:20,400
Their Kickstarter is like only halfway done.

789
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:23,280
So go help them meet.

790
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:24,000
It's like that one.

791
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,160
What's that one game that just got all the money?

792
00:38:26,160 --> 00:38:27,680
Like all the games that are on Kickstarter.

793
00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:31,760
I want this to be a success story because it looks really cool.

794
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:32,240
And I would like to play it.

795
00:38:32,240 --> 00:38:32,800
It looks cool.

796
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:37,040
And when you go to mobrulesgames.com, you will need to scroll down past the first post to get

797
00:38:37,040 --> 00:38:37,760
to the Kickstarter.

798
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:39,920
Actually, you know what?

799
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:41,840
It's still on the right hand side of the page.

800
00:38:41,840 --> 00:38:44,480
You'll see a box that just says Haunts Kickstarter.

801
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:47,760
So you can go there and we'll try to tweet it out tomorrow to make it even easier for

802
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:49,920
you to go donate and get a copy of the game.

803
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:53,200
For like for five bucks, you can have a copy of this game.

804
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:55,280
And for every five bucks you donate, you get another copy.

805
00:38:55,280 --> 00:38:56,160
You can sell to friends.

806
00:38:57,360 --> 00:38:58,320
Profiteering.

807
00:38:58,320 --> 00:38:58,880
We love it.

808
00:38:58,880 --> 00:39:01,360
Hey, guys, can I tell you about another show on the on the IFC?

809
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:03,120
Yeah, please do.

810
00:39:03,120 --> 00:39:04,160
It's called Bunk.

811
00:39:04,160 --> 00:39:06,480
It comes on it's not to be confused with Monk.

812
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:07,280
It's called Bunk.

813
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:11,360
It's at 1030 right after Comedy Bang Bang, which you should also definitely be watching.

814
00:39:11,360 --> 00:39:16,080
It is a game show where improv comics play for inane prizes and non charitable causes.

815
00:39:16,640 --> 00:39:19,760
It's got categories like whose crotch is hotter?

816
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:20,720
Shame that puppy.

817
00:39:21,360 --> 00:39:24,560
Give that bitch some arms and un-stamp the tramp.

818
00:39:24,560 --> 00:39:28,560
That's Bunk, 1030, IFC, where comedians come to play.

819
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:31,920
I have to know what shame that puppy is.

820
00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:33,920
Griffin, did you write that tagline?

821
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:35,840
I may have.

822
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:37,920
It's like the new jingle.

823
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:41,920
I put a little put a spin on a tagline.

824
00:39:41,920 --> 00:39:43,520
This game show is click.

825
00:39:43,520 --> 00:39:44,720
So wait a minute, Griffin.

826
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:50,240
OK, Travis, I think you maybe missed the utility of your own tagline.

827
00:39:50,240 --> 00:39:51,040
I'm not sure you quite.

828
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:53,920
It works for literally every occasion.

829
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:55,440
This birthday is click.

830
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:56,560
This funeral is click.

831
00:39:58,560 --> 00:40:00,960
So happy anniversary to Alex and Christina.

832
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:05,120
And go to mobrulesgames.com right now and watch Bunk at 1030.

833
00:40:05,120 --> 00:40:05,680
I'm not kidding.

834
00:40:05,680 --> 00:40:07,120
I want to play that fucking game.

835
00:40:07,120 --> 00:40:08,080
So go fund serious.

836
00:40:08,080 --> 00:40:10,160
Don't you guys let me down this time, Internet?

837
00:40:10,160 --> 00:40:11,200
Like you do everything else.

838
00:40:13,040 --> 00:40:15,280
Hey, I work in an office that enjoys pranks.

839
00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:22,560
This sounds like a bad, bad setup for amateur pornography.

840
00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:24,160
But I'm going to go on.

841
00:40:24,160 --> 00:40:29,840
Most recently, we gave a guy a cubicle lawn with real grass while he was away on his honeymoon.

842
00:40:30,640 --> 00:40:31,360
And it's beautiful.

843
00:40:31,360 --> 00:40:32,880
They attached a picture to the email.

844
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:34,880
It they did a really great nail it.

845
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:37,360
OK, that's where the issue is.

846
00:40:37,360 --> 00:40:39,040
Can you put it on the forums or something, Travis?

847
00:40:39,040 --> 00:40:39,840
I totally will.

848
00:40:39,840 --> 00:40:40,080
All right.

849
00:40:40,080 --> 00:40:41,440
Totally maximum fun.org.

850
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:44,480
That's where the issue is.

851
00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:46,800
Another coworker got married when on his honeymoon.

852
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:49,280
We found out yesterday that when he returns, he's going to be fired.

853
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:50,160
Oh, no.

854
00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:53,840
But he's totally expecting a prank when he gets back.

855
00:40:54,880 --> 00:40:55,520
Oh, no.

856
00:40:56,160 --> 00:40:57,520
This is what do I do?

857
00:40:58,080 --> 00:41:01,520
He might think that being the firing is actually a goof

858
00:41:01,520 --> 00:41:04,320
and it could lead to a seriously awkward situation.

859
00:41:04,320 --> 00:41:06,000
Maybe I ought to prank him anyway,

860
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:10,960
so that when he gets called into his boss's office, he knows it's legit.

861
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:13,920
That's from you got punked and also fired.

862
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:15,040
Oh, my God.

863
00:41:15,040 --> 00:41:16,320
Oh, no.

864
00:41:16,320 --> 00:41:20,880
Can you imagine working in an office where upon returning from like a weeklong vacation,

865
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:26,320
not finding your cubicle covered in wrapping paper or like full of balloons

866
00:41:26,320 --> 00:41:28,160
was a sign that there was trouble?

867
00:41:28,160 --> 00:41:30,160
Like, wait, guys, where's the flamingos?

868
00:41:30,720 --> 00:41:31,600
Oh, no.

869
00:41:31,600 --> 00:41:32,480
Am I fired?

870
00:41:32,480 --> 00:41:33,680
Is something wrong?

871
00:41:34,640 --> 00:41:38,480
The only thing I can think is that you have to you have to punk him

872
00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:45,360
and the punking has to be so heinous that when he gets fired,

873
00:41:45,360 --> 00:41:48,160
he's like, well, good, because I could never come back here anyway.

874
00:41:48,160 --> 00:41:49,600
Like you got it on his desk.

875
00:41:49,600 --> 00:41:53,760
You got to get like four people to hold him down while you like staple his balls to his leg.

876
00:41:54,960 --> 00:41:55,280
Right.

877
00:41:55,280 --> 00:41:56,800
And then, like when he gets fired, he's like,

878
00:41:56,800 --> 00:41:59,280
oh, thank God I could never look those people in the eye again.

879
00:42:00,640 --> 00:42:01,140
Oh.

880
00:42:01,140 --> 00:42:09,780
Oh, I unlet maybe or maybe maybe you let him think it's the long con.

881
00:42:10,660 --> 00:42:15,060
Maybe you let him think it's the long drift until that paycheck stop showing up.

882
00:42:15,060 --> 00:42:16,980
But that could be part of the goof.

883
00:42:16,980 --> 00:42:19,460
Like, oh, so you're like, I can't believe you fell for it.

884
00:42:19,460 --> 00:42:21,380
Yeah, that's where my key card doesn't work anymore.

885
00:42:21,380 --> 00:42:22,980
Man, they're really serious about this goof.

886
00:42:24,580 --> 00:42:26,180
It's been a couple of months without a paycheck.

887
00:42:26,180 --> 00:42:28,580
And by that point, you already forgot this dude existed.

888
00:42:28,580 --> 00:42:31,860
And could you punk him after he gets fired?

889
00:42:32,500 --> 00:42:35,780
Like as he walks out of the office, a bucket of water falls on his head.

890
00:42:36,980 --> 00:42:38,580
He's like, was this whole thing?

891
00:42:38,580 --> 00:42:38,820
Nope.

892
00:42:38,820 --> 00:42:40,660
Just the water bucket was.

893
00:42:40,660 --> 00:42:42,420
But you you have been relieved.

894
00:42:43,860 --> 00:42:46,420
But we do need you to collect your things and go.

895
00:42:46,420 --> 00:42:48,340
And could you clean up the water, please?

896
00:42:48,340 --> 00:42:50,340
Maybe security will be here in 30 minutes.

897
00:42:50,340 --> 00:42:52,420
Could you please towel up the mess you made?

898
00:42:52,420 --> 00:42:54,340
Probably a pretty good joke would be after he gets fired.

899
00:42:54,340 --> 00:42:57,540
You asked him like you pretend like you're going to Jerry McGuire with him.

900
00:42:57,540 --> 00:43:00,340
And the two of you are going to go off and start your own agency.

901
00:43:01,060 --> 00:43:02,900
And then it's your first meeting with Cuba.

902
00:43:02,900 --> 00:43:04,180
You just don't show.

903
00:43:04,180 --> 00:43:05,300
You're back at work.

904
00:43:05,300 --> 00:43:06,740
This agency doesn't exist.

905
00:43:06,740 --> 00:43:08,260
And this meeting isn't with Cuba.

906
00:43:08,820 --> 00:43:11,380
It's with Frank, the guy who runs the Starbucks down on 13th.

907
00:43:13,780 --> 00:43:15,300
Also, I got you a job at Starbucks.

908
00:43:17,620 --> 00:43:19,380
Just hug him and be there for him.

909
00:43:19,380 --> 00:43:21,460
Just remember it's not your problem.

910
00:43:21,460 --> 00:43:22,820
And then just be there for him.

911
00:43:23,540 --> 00:43:24,740
Maybe take a sick day.

912
00:43:24,740 --> 00:43:27,540
Maybe take a sick day the day you know this thing is happening.

913
00:43:28,500 --> 00:43:29,460
They did what?

914
00:43:31,060 --> 00:43:32,420
They did who?

915
00:43:32,420 --> 00:43:33,940
Are you sure this isn't a goof?

916
00:43:35,940 --> 00:43:37,220
Are you goofing me?

917
00:43:37,220 --> 00:43:38,500
Are you goofing me?

918
00:43:38,500 --> 00:43:39,540
Is this a goof right now?

919
00:43:39,540 --> 00:43:41,220
Are you double goofing on me?

920
00:43:41,220 --> 00:43:42,180
I don't believe it.

921
00:43:42,180 --> 00:43:47,300
I still love the idea of like this guy tapping into his kid's college fund to pay the mortgage.

922
00:43:47,300 --> 00:43:50,820
Like man, this goof is going on like really far.

923
00:43:50,820 --> 00:43:55,300
Maybe you goof the whole office and like after this guy gets fired, you come in the next day

924
00:43:55,300 --> 00:43:58,420
and you set up his cubicle like he's still there.

925
00:43:58,420 --> 00:44:04,660
And like from time to time, just move things around and like change the desktop and do stuff

926
00:44:04,660 --> 00:44:06,740
and try to convince people that he still works there.

927
00:44:06,740 --> 00:44:10,500
Can you find a guy that looks exactly like him to do his job?

928
00:44:10,500 --> 00:44:11,460
Holy shit.

929
00:44:11,460 --> 00:44:13,540
And see if you can't collect two paychecks.

930
00:44:13,540 --> 00:44:14,580
Well, wait a minute.

931
00:44:14,580 --> 00:44:16,740
No, because once he gets fired, he's gonna be like,

932
00:44:16,740 --> 00:44:17,700
I'm gonna go to work.

933
00:44:17,700 --> 00:44:18,660
I'm gonna go to work.

934
00:44:18,660 --> 00:44:21,940
Well, no, because once he gets fired, you know, once someone gets fired,

935
00:44:21,940 --> 00:44:23,220
they don't get paychecks anymore.

936
00:44:24,260 --> 00:44:26,900
But maybe if you convince him that the guy's still there.

937
00:44:27,700 --> 00:44:30,340
This is a terrible thing that's going to happen to this person.

938
00:44:30,340 --> 00:44:33,860
Have you considered talking to the bosses and saying like, please not him.

939
00:44:34,420 --> 00:44:35,860
He's on his fucking honeymoon.

940
00:44:35,860 --> 00:44:36,500
That's that's.

941
00:44:36,500 --> 00:44:38,340
Yeah, that is really shady.

942
00:44:38,340 --> 00:44:39,140
That's really shady.

943
00:44:39,140 --> 00:44:40,580
Maybe you should consider quitting.

944
00:44:41,540 --> 00:44:43,620
By which I mean before this guy gets back.

945
00:44:43,620 --> 00:44:46,020
I mean, unless this guy is just a terrible guy.

946
00:44:46,020 --> 00:44:49,060
Terrible people don't get married, though, is the problem.

947
00:44:49,060 --> 00:44:51,620
But I'm saying like, this is his fourth honeymoon in two months.

948
00:44:51,620 --> 00:44:52,580
Oh, okay.

949
00:44:52,580 --> 00:44:54,900
Well, that's incredibly improbable.

950
00:44:54,900 --> 00:44:56,580
No, in which I'm not referring to Bigamy.

951
00:44:56,580 --> 00:44:59,620
I mean, with the same person, he's taken four honeymoons.

952
00:44:59,620 --> 00:45:02,100
They're just living a different lifestyle, Travis.

953
00:45:02,100 --> 00:45:06,580
Like, your problems with Bigamy are really dragging the show down.

954
00:45:06,580 --> 00:45:07,700
No, I'm not knocking Bigamy.

955
00:45:07,700 --> 00:45:09,300
I don't understand why you have to be such a big'em.

956
00:45:09,940 --> 00:45:12,500
Big'em makes, Bigamy makes, I fucking hate you.

957
00:45:13,700 --> 00:45:15,220
Big'em reminds me of the dig'em problem.

958
00:45:15,220 --> 00:45:16,740
Big'em is my favorite cereal mascot.

959
00:45:18,420 --> 00:45:21,220
But Bigamy totally makes financial and fiscal sense.

960
00:45:21,220 --> 00:45:24,660
I'm saying that maybe this guy just really likes taking vacations.

961
00:45:24,660 --> 00:45:28,100
What doesn't make sense to me is that the Sugar Smacks Frog is a big'emist.

962
00:45:28,100 --> 00:45:29,540
Is that what you're saying to me?

963
00:45:29,540 --> 00:45:30,260
Yes.

964
00:45:30,260 --> 00:45:30,980
Dig'em Frog.

965
00:45:32,260 --> 00:45:35,300
He's married to Lucky and the Sugar Bear.

966
00:45:36,740 --> 00:45:38,660
Okay, see, this has always been confusing to me.

967
00:45:38,660 --> 00:45:40,980
Sugar Smacks and Golden Crisp are the same cereal, right?

968
00:45:41,860 --> 00:45:43,620
Wait, which one's Sugar Smacks?

969
00:45:43,620 --> 00:45:45,060
Is that the one with Dig'em Frog?

970
00:45:45,060 --> 00:45:46,660
Sugar Smacks has Dig'em Frog.

971
00:45:48,420 --> 00:45:52,740
Golden Crisp also, which is also, is also Sugar Crisp.

972
00:45:53,940 --> 00:45:56,900
Oh, that's, I can't get enough of that, Sugar Crisp.

973
00:45:56,900 --> 00:45:58,580
Right, but Honey Smacks are the same.

974
00:45:58,580 --> 00:46:02,260
I mean, they're basically just puffed wheat with sugar.

975
00:46:02,260 --> 00:46:05,300
Wait, you might've just blown the lid off Big Cereal.

976
00:46:05,300 --> 00:46:06,660
Is all cereal the same?

977
00:46:06,660 --> 00:46:09,540
It's some form of wheat or rice covered in sugar?

978
00:46:09,540 --> 00:46:11,540
Well, I mean, that is 100% accurate.

979
00:46:11,540 --> 00:46:16,020
I'm saying to you right now that it's been way too long

980
00:46:16,020 --> 00:46:19,540
since I've eaten Golden Crisp or Sugar Smacks

981
00:46:19,540 --> 00:46:20,420
or anything like that.

982
00:46:20,420 --> 00:46:21,940
I really like those cereals.

983
00:46:21,940 --> 00:46:22,980
What have I been waiting on?

984
00:46:23,620 --> 00:46:24,180
I don't know.

985
00:46:24,820 --> 00:46:25,380
Live your life.

986
00:46:26,420 --> 00:46:27,220
Griffin, you like those?

987
00:46:28,260 --> 00:46:29,860
I can't eat cereal anymore.

988
00:46:30,660 --> 00:46:31,700
What? Why not?

989
00:46:31,700 --> 00:46:33,300
It gives me fart butts.

990
00:46:34,580 --> 00:46:35,700
I can't eat it either.

991
00:46:35,700 --> 00:46:39,300
I like, I'm on that low carb lifestyle.

992
00:46:39,300 --> 00:46:40,820
I'm just thinking about how good it would be.

993
00:46:40,820 --> 00:46:42,980
Ever since they discontinued French Toast Crunch,

994
00:46:42,980 --> 00:46:44,500
it's like, what's the point?

995
00:46:45,140 --> 00:46:46,660
Can you even get Waffle Crisp anymore?

996
00:46:46,660 --> 00:46:47,300
Nope, gone.

997
00:46:48,180 --> 00:46:49,140
Son of a bitch.

998
00:46:50,100 --> 00:46:52,180
Hey, let's talk about something else.

999
00:46:52,180 --> 00:46:54,180
You know what the best part about Waffle Crisp is?

1000
00:46:54,180 --> 00:46:56,580
You will smell like Waffle Crisp for the next six days.

1001
00:46:56,580 --> 00:46:56,740
Yeah.

1002
00:46:58,100 --> 00:46:59,460
That is the best thing about it.

1003
00:47:00,820 --> 00:47:02,580
Makes your hands feel like spider webs too.

1004
00:47:03,380 --> 00:47:05,380
This Yahoo answer was sent in by Brent Black.

1005
00:47:05,380 --> 00:47:06,580
Thank you, Brent Black.

1006
00:47:06,580 --> 00:47:08,900
Brentel Floss of the internet.

1007
00:47:08,900 --> 00:47:11,780
It's by Yahoo Answers user CBKitty who asks,

1008
00:47:11,780 --> 00:47:14,260
does your spouse ever smile during sex?

1009
00:47:15,380 --> 00:47:17,460
Me and my husband were having sex the other night

1010
00:47:17,460 --> 00:47:20,340
and I looked up at him and he was giving me this wide grin.

1011
00:47:22,100 --> 00:47:22,820
Oh no!

1012
00:47:22,820 --> 00:47:26,900
I immediately thought it was very creepy and told him so.

1013
00:47:26,900 --> 00:47:29,060
Of course, immediately I was completely turned off

1014
00:47:29,060 --> 00:47:30,100
and told him to finish.

1015
00:47:30,900 --> 00:47:33,540
I was a little harsh, I know, but it really creeped me out.

1016
00:47:33,540 --> 00:47:36,500
I'm expecting a look of pleasure on his face, but not a grin.

1017
00:47:36,500 --> 00:47:40,340
Does your spouse ever do this?

1018
00:47:40,340 --> 00:47:41,860
My spouse is going full Joker.

1019
00:47:43,540 --> 00:47:45,540
It's like fucking the Cheshire Cat.

1020
00:47:45,540 --> 00:47:46,580
Will you please just finish?

1021
00:47:46,580 --> 00:47:49,860
My spouse has been hit by smilex and it's creeping me the fuck out.

1022
00:47:50,900 --> 00:47:55,780
I think the creepier part is something happened during your lovemaking sesh

1023
00:47:55,780 --> 00:48:00,420
and it turned you off and you were like, just finish.

1024
00:48:00,420 --> 00:48:02,660
Just finish already, Randy, and let's get this over with.

1025
00:48:02,660 --> 00:48:06,660
Flip the orgasm button and just go, please.

1026
00:48:07,540 --> 00:48:09,220
Just stop holding it back and let's roll.

1027
00:48:09,220 --> 00:48:10,500
Let's just roll on this.

1028
00:48:10,500 --> 00:48:11,220
Open it up.

1029
00:48:12,340 --> 00:48:13,220
Just open it up.

1030
00:48:14,100 --> 00:48:18,900
I think it's a pretty cool wife that the big turn off for her

1031
00:48:18,900 --> 00:48:21,140
is my husband enjoying himself.

1032
00:48:21,140 --> 00:48:21,780
But it's not-

1033
00:48:22,340 --> 00:48:26,020
No, I want him to quietly and enjoy himself,

1034
00:48:26,020 --> 00:48:27,060
but I want him to hide it.

1035
00:48:27,060 --> 00:48:30,020
I want his face to be a mask or maybe a literal mask.

1036
00:48:30,020 --> 00:48:32,820
Yeah, your face when you're making love should always look like you're

1037
00:48:32,820 --> 00:48:35,140
in the finals of some sort of math league.

1038
00:48:36,500 --> 00:48:38,500
You've got to look very consternated.

1039
00:48:38,500 --> 00:48:41,620
You've got to look like you're really just giving it your all.

1040
00:48:41,620 --> 00:48:45,780
And when you're grinning, a grin is not a good bedtime look.

1041
00:48:46,660 --> 00:48:50,020
No, a grin says I know something you don't know,

1042
00:48:50,020 --> 00:48:52,420
which is never a good look to have during sex.

1043
00:48:52,420 --> 00:48:52,920
Yeah.

1044
00:48:54,340 --> 00:48:56,740
And everybody, different strokes for different folks.

1045
00:48:56,740 --> 00:48:59,380
Different smokes for different pokes,

1046
00:48:59,380 --> 00:49:05,860
but I just think that if you are giving your partner like a wry smile,

1047
00:49:05,860 --> 00:49:07,780
then you're not doing something right.

1048
00:49:10,500 --> 00:49:13,860
It's so like smiling.

1049
00:49:14,500 --> 00:49:17,220
It's like if you let out like a soft giggle,

1050
00:49:17,220 --> 00:49:18,980
a titter while you're making love.

1051
00:49:20,180 --> 00:49:20,680
Titter.

1052
00:49:21,700 --> 00:49:25,540
If you just said titter.

1053
00:49:25,540 --> 00:49:27,140
Titter.

1054
00:49:27,140 --> 00:49:30,500
God, my penis just went so far inside my body.

1055
00:49:31,380 --> 00:49:32,900
It's hanging out with my stomach now.

1056
00:49:35,140 --> 00:49:37,620
No, what you got to do is commit the full belly laugh.

1057
00:49:41,300 --> 00:49:41,800
Yeah.

1058
00:49:42,260 --> 00:49:42,900
Yeah.

1059
00:49:42,900 --> 00:49:44,180
We are making love.

1060
00:49:44,820 --> 00:49:45,860
Now that I think about it,

1061
00:49:45,860 --> 00:49:48,820
there are so few things that you can do while you're making love.

1062
00:49:49,460 --> 00:49:51,620
There's like one or two things you can do

1063
00:49:51,620 --> 00:49:54,660
and everything else is like, no, I can't do that.

1064
00:49:54,660 --> 00:49:55,540
Which will be worse?

1065
00:49:55,540 --> 00:49:58,420
Looking up and seeing your other grinning or frowning?

1066
00:49:59,620 --> 00:50:01,540
Or anything frowning.

1067
00:50:01,540 --> 00:50:02,900
I think is actually more commonplace.

1068
00:50:02,900 --> 00:50:03,380
Don't you think?

1069
00:50:04,260 --> 00:50:04,580
Yeah.

1070
00:50:04,580 --> 00:50:05,300
Because you're focused.

1071
00:50:06,180 --> 00:50:06,900
Like Conan.

1072
00:50:06,900 --> 00:50:07,860
That's angry face.

1073
00:50:07,860 --> 00:50:08,260
Okay.

1074
00:50:08,260 --> 00:50:10,900
It only seems like you can't do those things.

1075
00:50:10,900 --> 00:50:11,540
No.

1076
00:50:11,540 --> 00:50:12,500
You know, you can.

1077
00:50:12,500 --> 00:50:12,980
No.

1078
00:50:12,980 --> 00:50:14,340
It's because you live in America,

1079
00:50:15,300 --> 00:50:17,940
land of the free and home with the bland.

1080
00:50:17,940 --> 00:50:21,060
And you open up your sphere a little bit.

1081
00:50:21,060 --> 00:50:23,060
If I see what possibilities are there.

1082
00:50:23,060 --> 00:50:24,740
Just turn to the page in the Kama Sutra

1083
00:50:24,740 --> 00:50:26,340
where it shows you all the different faces.

1084
00:50:26,340 --> 00:50:27,380
I'm your brother.

1085
00:50:27,380 --> 00:50:28,260
You're grossing me out.

1086
00:50:29,060 --> 00:50:29,700
You can't.

1087
00:50:29,700 --> 00:50:32,660
Do the one where you hook your pinkies inside the corners of your mouth.

1088
00:50:32,660 --> 00:50:35,220
As you're driving past each other.

1089
00:50:38,340 --> 00:50:40,660
Can you have sex out the window of a moving vehicle?

1090
00:50:41,620 --> 00:50:42,580
Not if you're smiling.

1091
00:50:43,300 --> 00:50:46,420
So what if you like sneeze during sex?

1092
00:50:46,420 --> 00:50:47,860
Has anyone ever done that before?

1093
00:50:48,580 --> 00:50:49,620
Your body actually can't.

1094
00:50:49,620 --> 00:50:53,700
It's how you can't like hum with your mouth closed.

1095
00:50:54,740 --> 00:50:55,300
What?

1096
00:50:55,300 --> 00:50:57,460
I mean, it's like you can't pinch your nose and hub.

1097
00:50:58,980 --> 00:51:02,900
It's like how you can't eat an entire spoonful of cocoa and hum at the same time.

1098
00:51:02,900 --> 00:51:03,140
Sure.

1099
00:51:04,660 --> 00:51:06,500
What if they gently hum while you're making love?

1100
00:51:07,220 --> 00:51:08,420
And not like a sex way?

1101
00:51:09,700 --> 00:51:10,500
If they were just like...

1102
00:51:13,380 --> 00:51:15,460
No, like humming like a tune.

1103
00:51:15,460 --> 00:51:17,060
Like the Samford theme song.

1104
00:51:17,060 --> 00:51:20,020
Not just like a...

1105
00:51:20,020 --> 00:51:21,380
Like you're some sort of jet bike?

1106
00:51:23,380 --> 00:51:26,420
And as you rev up the big O, you literally rev up.

1107
00:51:26,420 --> 00:51:27,140
Oh, God.

1108
00:51:28,260 --> 00:51:29,540
The big O?

1109
00:51:29,540 --> 00:51:30,980
What's the matter, you guys?

1110
00:51:30,980 --> 00:51:33,940
Guys, I figured that would be better than actually saying orgasm, wasn't it?

1111
00:51:33,940 --> 00:51:35,220
No, they're both bad.

1112
00:51:35,220 --> 00:51:36,420
They're both so bad.

1113
00:51:36,420 --> 00:51:38,420
I just want to talk about anything else.

1114
00:51:38,420 --> 00:51:39,860
Happy time finish sauce.

1115
00:51:42,980 --> 00:51:44,900
Okay, so that was the most repellent thing you could say.

1116
00:51:44,900 --> 00:51:45,860
All right, because I didn't know.

1117
00:51:45,860 --> 00:51:47,220
I wasn't sure.

1118
00:51:47,220 --> 00:51:48,100
I was just trying to one up, you know?

1119
00:51:48,100 --> 00:51:48,660
You got to get...

1120
00:51:48,660 --> 00:51:49,220
Come on.

1121
00:51:51,220 --> 00:51:52,180
Oh, God, no.

1122
00:51:53,780 --> 00:51:55,460
I'm getting married this weekend.

1123
00:51:55,460 --> 00:51:56,020
Yesterday.

1124
00:51:57,460 --> 00:51:58,180
That's confusing.

1125
00:51:58,740 --> 00:51:59,460
I know.

1126
00:51:59,460 --> 00:52:02,100
This weekend, Saturday, May 26th was yesterday.

1127
00:52:02,100 --> 00:52:07,380
And wanted to know if you've got any outside the box advice for solving marital problems.

1128
00:52:07,380 --> 00:52:09,300
Yeah, don't get married, right?

1129
00:52:09,300 --> 00:52:13,860
Get a man cave.

1130
00:52:13,860 --> 00:52:17,300
Justin's actually gnawing.

1131
00:52:17,300 --> 00:52:19,460
Justin's gnawing on a branch right now.

1132
00:52:19,460 --> 00:52:21,860
He's gnawing on his own leg to escape from marriage.

1133
00:52:21,860 --> 00:52:23,380
Get out of the bear trap.

1134
00:52:25,620 --> 00:52:28,180
So outside the box advice for solving...

1135
00:52:28,180 --> 00:52:28,980
Don't get in the box.

1136
00:52:30,100 --> 00:52:31,380
Don't let her put you in a box.

1137
00:52:31,940 --> 00:52:33,460
That's an unhealthy relationship.

1138
00:52:36,100 --> 00:52:36,580
Just be...

1139
00:52:37,300 --> 00:52:39,060
Just love is patient.

1140
00:52:39,060 --> 00:52:40,020
Love is kind.

1141
00:52:40,820 --> 00:52:41,780
Love is blind.

1142
00:52:41,780 --> 00:52:43,140
And it'll take over your mind.

1143
00:52:45,140 --> 00:52:47,540
Then you'll find inside the rind.

1144
00:52:48,580 --> 00:52:51,380
You can get ready to grind on that skateboard of love.

1145
00:52:52,260 --> 00:52:54,500
That's my favorite Mary J. Blige song.

1146
00:52:56,100 --> 00:52:57,460
Marriage is like a skateboard.

1147
00:52:58,980 --> 00:53:00,500
So outside the box advice.

1148
00:53:00,500 --> 00:53:09,460
I think the number one thing that determines whether or not you're ready to be married to

1149
00:53:09,460 --> 00:53:12,100
somebody is if you're capable.

1150
00:53:12,100 --> 00:53:17,220
And some people aren't to this point in their maturity yet, where you're able to think,

1151
00:53:17,220 --> 00:53:22,100
like see a problem from somebody else's perspective.

1152
00:53:22,100 --> 00:53:27,300
And I think that if you can learn that one skill and practice that one thing in marriage

1153
00:53:27,300 --> 00:53:30,980
that it'll solve a lot of your issues.

1154
00:53:30,980 --> 00:53:35,300
If you're just willing to take two seconds and say, try to see it, like literally put

1155
00:53:35,300 --> 00:53:37,700
yourself, not literally put yourself in their shoes.

1156
00:53:37,700 --> 00:53:40,500
That's a whole other bevy of marital problems.

1157
00:53:41,300 --> 00:53:47,300
But to put yourself in their shoes and think like, hey, why are they thinking this way?

1158
00:53:47,300 --> 00:53:51,620
Because I guarantee if you take those seconds and slow it down a little bit, you'll be able

1159
00:53:51,620 --> 00:53:54,420
to figure out a lot more than you think you're capable of.

1160
00:53:54,420 --> 00:54:00,820
Honestly, here's another one, the person that you are getting married to knows you better

1161
00:54:00,820 --> 00:54:02,420
than anyone else knows you.

1162
00:54:03,060 --> 00:54:07,860
And so all of those things that you tell yourself that you do that are awesome and cute and

1163
00:54:07,860 --> 00:54:12,260
adorable, if your significant other says, hey, just so you know, that's really kind

1164
00:54:12,260 --> 00:54:16,180
of annoying and you should stop doing that, you should probably listen to that person

1165
00:54:16,180 --> 00:54:17,860
instead of trying to defend yourself.

1166
00:54:17,860 --> 00:54:22,980
Yeah, you got to realize that like a lot of the process of like, you know, you're not

1167
00:54:22,980 --> 00:54:29,700
this is like getting growing up in a marriage is like letting go of your bullshit and the

1168
00:54:29,700 --> 00:54:32,020
person will know your bullshit better than anybody.

1169
00:54:32,020 --> 00:54:37,620
And the source of a lot of fights, especially early, is like the where you find your bullshit

1170
00:54:37,620 --> 00:54:38,660
stops working.

1171
00:54:38,660 --> 00:54:38,980
Yeah.

1172
00:54:38,980 --> 00:54:39,540
Oh, wait a minute.

1173
00:54:39,540 --> 00:54:40,420
That doesn't OK.

1174
00:54:40,420 --> 00:54:41,300
That's not a good one.

1175
00:54:41,300 --> 00:54:43,220
That's not a good bullshit anymore.

1176
00:54:43,220 --> 00:54:45,700
You should always Teresa calls me on all the time.

1177
00:54:45,700 --> 00:54:49,460
I try to use I love you as like a barometer for how the situation is going.

1178
00:54:49,460 --> 00:54:49,860
Yeah.

1179
00:54:49,860 --> 00:54:51,940
And usually there's a question mark at the end.

1180
00:54:51,940 --> 00:54:54,260
I love it's your depth charge.

1181
00:54:54,260 --> 00:54:54,500
Yeah.

1182
00:54:54,500 --> 00:54:56,580
So like she started calling me on that.

1183
00:54:56,580 --> 00:55:01,140
And when that happens, that's how you take steps towards becoming a better person.

1184
00:55:01,140 --> 00:55:05,860
But only if you're willing to accept it, because typically it's just going to make you angry

1185
00:55:05,860 --> 00:55:07,380
because like, ah, you're so right.

1186
00:55:07,940 --> 00:55:09,460
How did you know my bullshit?

1187
00:55:09,460 --> 00:55:10,420
You know, my tricks.

1188
00:55:10,420 --> 00:55:10,980
You got me.

1189
00:55:11,860 --> 00:55:18,020
You should always you should also always live under the assumption that your wife is probably

1190
00:55:18,740 --> 00:55:19,940
cheating on you.

1191
00:55:19,940 --> 00:55:24,340
Probably, well, why?

1192
00:55:24,340 --> 00:55:27,940
I'm just saying if you prep yourself, that's terrible advice.

1193
00:55:27,940 --> 00:55:30,420
You're saying like live on the defensive.

1194
00:55:30,420 --> 00:55:36,260
I'm saying you've either got to set up a swing agreement.

1195
00:55:38,100 --> 00:55:39,540
It's the rest of your life.

1196
00:55:39,540 --> 00:55:41,700
Have you have you worked out your swing agreement?

1197
00:55:41,700 --> 00:55:42,260
Yeah.

1198
00:55:42,260 --> 00:55:43,460
Do you have it down on paper?

1199
00:55:43,460 --> 00:55:44,500
Because it might be a smoke.

1200
00:55:44,500 --> 00:55:45,940
You have a swing agreement.

1201
00:55:45,940 --> 00:55:47,540
Do you have a safe couples right now?

1202
00:55:47,540 --> 00:55:50,260
You need the Treaty of Versailles.

1203
00:55:50,260 --> 00:55:52,580
You need the Treaty of Two Guys.

1204
00:55:52,580 --> 00:55:54,740
You need to you need to work something out.

1205
00:55:54,740 --> 00:55:55,780
You got to figure it out.

1206
00:55:55,780 --> 00:55:58,180
Find a lawyer and have him draw you up a doctor.

1207
00:55:58,180 --> 00:56:00,020
Talking about the rest of your life, dog.

1208
00:56:00,660 --> 00:56:03,380
Find a lawyer that can hang.

1209
00:56:03,380 --> 00:56:05,060
Find a lawyer that's a liberal lawyer.

1210
00:56:05,060 --> 00:56:05,940
Kind of chill.

1211
00:56:05,940 --> 00:56:06,980
And how about this?

1212
00:56:06,980 --> 00:56:09,540
Go to marriage counseling day one.

1213
00:56:09,540 --> 00:56:11,140
It's not just for people who are in trouble.

1214
00:56:12,020 --> 00:56:14,820
Yeah, you don't just go to the doctor when your butt falls off.

1215
00:56:14,820 --> 00:56:15,460
Exactly.

1216
00:56:15,460 --> 00:56:20,100
Prevention is nine tenths of not having your butt fall off.

1217
00:56:20,900 --> 00:56:21,380
I've always.

1218
00:56:21,380 --> 00:56:22,420
Metaphorically speaking.

1219
00:56:22,420 --> 00:56:22,900
No, literally.

1220
00:56:22,900 --> 00:56:25,460
50% of marriages end in divorce.

1221
00:56:25,460 --> 00:56:27,140
So I guess what I'm saying is you pay your money,

1222
00:56:27,140 --> 00:56:28,020
you take your chances.

1223
00:56:29,060 --> 00:56:30,340
There's no way to tell if this is going to work out or not.

1224
00:56:30,340 --> 00:56:32,020
And also, I guess that's another piece of advice.

1225
00:56:32,020 --> 00:56:32,580
No one to hold them.

1226
00:56:32,580 --> 00:56:33,300
No one to fold them.

1227
00:56:33,300 --> 00:56:34,180
That's all I'm going to say.

1228
00:56:34,180 --> 00:56:34,660
No one to walk away.

1229
00:56:34,660 --> 00:56:35,220
That's all I'm going to say.

1230
00:56:35,220 --> 00:56:35,860
No one to run.

1231
00:56:35,860 --> 00:56:37,220
There's always a way out.

1232
00:56:37,220 --> 00:56:38,900
That's all I'm going to say, Josh.

1233
00:56:38,900 --> 00:56:40,100
Know your exit strategy.

1234
00:56:40,660 --> 00:56:42,500
Follow the closest exit.

1235
00:56:42,500 --> 00:56:44,020
Maybe you have a fake beard buried in the yard.

1236
00:56:44,020 --> 00:56:45,780
The closest exit may be behind you.

1237
00:56:45,780 --> 00:56:47,060
That's all I'm saying, Josh.

1238
00:56:47,780 --> 00:56:48,180
Josh.

1239
00:56:49,220 --> 00:56:49,780
Josh.

1240
00:56:49,780 --> 00:56:50,980
How's your marriage going, Josh?

1241
00:56:50,980 --> 00:56:51,540
Light two.

1242
00:56:51,540 --> 00:56:52,020
Hey, Josh.

1243
00:56:52,820 --> 00:56:53,300
I know it's been 48.

1244
00:56:53,300 --> 00:56:55,940
You're probably still in what we like to call the honeymoon phase.

1245
00:56:57,060 --> 00:56:59,620
I should warn you, you will be fired upon your return.

1246
00:57:01,860 --> 00:57:03,460
Enjoy your time in Gatlinburg.

1247
00:57:06,980 --> 00:57:08,340
And then your marriage is going to dissolve,

1248
00:57:08,340 --> 00:57:10,500
but one of those two things is going to be a goof.

1249
00:57:10,500 --> 00:57:11,140
Your choice.

1250
00:57:11,140 --> 00:57:11,460
Yeah.

1251
00:57:11,460 --> 00:57:12,020
Your game, Josh.

1252
00:57:12,020 --> 00:57:12,660
Your choice.

1253
00:57:12,660 --> 00:57:13,620
Your game, Josh.

1254
00:57:13,620 --> 00:57:16,980
Nothing says strengthening our burgeoning relationship like,

1255
00:57:16,980 --> 00:57:18,820
honey, you're going to have to carry me for a while.

1256
00:57:18,820 --> 00:57:19,060
Yeah.

1257
00:57:19,700 --> 00:57:20,020
Yeah.

1258
00:57:20,740 --> 00:57:22,980
So this has been our goofy comedy show,

1259
00:57:22,980 --> 00:57:24,180
my brother, my brother, and me.

1260
00:57:24,180 --> 00:57:27,700
I'm so flattered that you took the time to listen this week.

1261
00:57:28,900 --> 00:57:30,900
If you could, if you get a second,

1262
00:57:30,900 --> 00:57:35,620
could you go to iTunes and maybe write a review for us

1263
00:57:35,620 --> 00:57:37,460
or subscribe to us there if you don't already?

1264
00:57:38,580 --> 00:57:40,420
And thank you to people who are tweeting about the show

1265
00:57:40,420 --> 00:57:47,460
with the M-B-A-M hashtag like Danarchist, Haley Head,

1266
00:57:47,460 --> 00:57:52,820
Sarah Jo Stevens, Tristan Mathers, follow here, there,

1267
00:57:52,820 --> 00:57:57,460
Philippe Young, our buddy Steven Strom, Aaron Myers,

1268
00:57:58,580 --> 00:58:01,540
Scott Garner, maybe Mumkin.

1269
00:58:01,540 --> 00:58:02,180
I could go on.

1270
00:58:02,180 --> 00:58:03,300
Are you having a stroke?

1271
00:58:05,460 --> 00:58:07,460
Like, do you know that you're slowing down

1272
00:58:07,460 --> 00:58:09,940
or am I speeding up and this is like a relativity thing?

1273
00:58:09,940 --> 00:58:12,980
Your comprehension has accelerated to a point where you can-

1274
00:58:12,980 --> 00:58:13,860
I've moved to planes.

1275
00:58:13,860 --> 00:58:15,140
You can no longer comprehend.

1276
00:58:15,140 --> 00:58:17,140
I want to thank John Roderick in the long winters

1277
00:58:17,140 --> 00:58:18,020
for the use of our theme song.

1278
00:58:18,020 --> 00:58:20,180
It's a departure off the album, Putting the Days to Bed.

1279
00:58:21,620 --> 00:58:23,780
Go, go pick that up.

1280
00:58:23,780 --> 00:58:26,180
It's a, it's a power jam for all seasons.

1281
00:58:26,980 --> 00:58:30,020
Hey, are you, sorry, Trav, you go right ahead.

1282
00:58:30,020 --> 00:58:31,060
Well, I was just going to say,

1283
00:58:31,060 --> 00:58:33,060
I just want to say how excited we all are for,

1284
00:58:33,060 --> 00:58:35,460
for Max Fun Con coming up next week.

1285
00:58:35,460 --> 00:58:37,220
We look forward to seeing everybody there.

1286
00:58:37,220 --> 00:58:39,940
And I also wanted to do a shameless self plug.

1287
00:58:40,740 --> 00:58:43,140
If there's anyone in the Cincinnati area,

1288
00:58:44,100 --> 00:58:47,140
June 8th, I'm going to be opening a show.

1289
00:58:47,140 --> 00:58:49,700
We're doing the complete works of William Shakespeare Abridged

1290
00:58:50,340 --> 00:58:53,300
starring me and my friends Nick Rose and Billy Chase

1291
00:58:53,300 --> 00:58:54,740
at the Cincinnati Shakespeare Company.

1292
00:58:55,620 --> 00:58:56,820
Tickets are on sale now.

1293
00:58:56,820 --> 00:58:58,820
You can get them at sensyshakes.com.

1294
00:58:58,820 --> 00:59:00,660
That's sensy with a Y, shakes.com.

1295
00:59:00,660 --> 00:59:02,020
I hope to see you all there.

1296
00:59:02,020 --> 00:59:04,820
And make sure you let them know that you came because of me.

1297
00:59:04,820 --> 00:59:06,100
Oh, that's gross.

1298
00:59:06,100 --> 00:59:08,020
That's gross.

1299
00:59:08,020 --> 00:59:08,740
Wait.

1300
00:59:08,740 --> 00:59:14,100
Can we, I just want to just, I guess a word of warning.

1301
00:59:14,100 --> 00:59:17,060
We're, so our next show is a live show at Max Fun Con

1302
00:59:17,060 --> 00:59:18,500
and Justin and I are both going to be in LA

1303
00:59:18,500 --> 00:59:20,500
for like a week after that.

1304
00:59:21,300 --> 00:59:24,420
So I don't know, we, the next episode may be up kind of late

1305
00:59:24,420 --> 00:59:26,260
because we're basically going straight from that

1306
00:59:26,260 --> 00:59:28,100
to a convention for work.

1307
00:59:28,100 --> 00:59:30,500
So, so the next episode may be a little bit late.

1308
00:59:30,500 --> 00:59:32,180
We're, we haven't figured that out yet.

1309
00:59:32,180 --> 00:59:34,340
Oh, along those same lines,

1310
00:59:34,340 --> 00:59:36,660
the three of us are going to be in LA at the Broadway Bar

1311
00:59:37,300 --> 00:59:42,020
for the, a party hosted by our current employer,

1312
00:59:42,020 --> 00:59:43,620
Polygon, not our current employer.

1313
00:59:43,620 --> 00:59:45,620
The website Griffin and I make called Polygon.

1314
00:59:45,620 --> 00:59:47,540
We're having a party at Broadway Bar,

1315
00:59:47,540 --> 00:59:50,740
I think seven to 11 on Sunday, June 3rd.

1316
00:59:50,740 --> 00:59:52,100
So we will all three be there.

1317
00:59:52,100 --> 00:59:54,580
So if you're in LA and you didn't get to go to Max Fun Con,

1318
00:59:54,580 --> 00:59:55,380
come hang out with us.

1319
00:59:55,380 --> 00:59:56,500
Yeah, come hang out.

1320
00:59:56,500 --> 00:59:57,300
We'll be there.

1321
00:59:57,300 --> 00:59:58,340
Also, we love you.

1322
00:59:58,340 --> 00:59:59,460
Thank you so much, you guys.

1323
00:59:59,460 --> 00:59:59,700
Thank you.

1324
00:59:59,700 --> 01:00:00,340
Thank you so much.

1325
01:00:00,340 --> 01:00:04,260
Uh, this final Yahoo answer was sent in by Mark Turetsky.

1326
01:00:04,980 --> 01:00:05,540
Thank you, Mark.

1327
01:00:05,540 --> 01:00:08,820
It's by Yahoo Answers user HiHiLayna who asks,

1328
01:00:09,540 --> 01:00:11,220
I'm convinced I am a potato.

1329
01:00:13,620 --> 01:00:15,060
I'm Justin McElroy.

1330
01:00:15,060 --> 01:00:15,860
I'm Travis McElroy.

1331
01:00:15,860 --> 01:00:17,300
I'm Griffin McElroy.

1332
01:00:17,300 --> 01:00:18,740
This has been my brother, my brother and me.

1333
01:00:18,740 --> 01:00:19,460
Kiss your dad.

1334
01:00:19,460 --> 01:00:21,220
Just go all the way around the lips.

1335
01:00:25,460 --> 01:00:27,140
Keep your heart three stacks.

1336
01:00:27,140 --> 01:00:28,180
Keep your heart.

1337
01:00:28,180 --> 01:00:30,340
Hey, keep your heart three stacks.

1338
01:00:30,340 --> 01:00:31,380
Keep your heart.

1339
01:00:31,380 --> 01:00:33,380
Man, these girls are smart three stacks.

1340
01:00:33,380 --> 01:00:34,500
These girls are smart.

1341
01:00:34,500 --> 01:00:58,500
Play your part.
