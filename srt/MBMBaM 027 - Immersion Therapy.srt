1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,620
The McElroy brothers are not experts and their advice should never be followed

2
00:00:05,740 --> 00:00:10,560
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it

3
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:17,640
Also, this show isn't for kids which I mentioned only so the babies out there will know how cool they are for listening

4
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:44,640
What's up, you cool, baby?

5
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:52,240
The Chilean Miners, no merging once again. Listen, you may be willing to forget about them that quickly

6
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:58,840
I'm not gonna forget about our Chilean brothers that emerged from the ground like that. How do we know there's not some more down there?

7
00:00:58,840 --> 00:01:00,840
Have we looked?

8
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:08,720
Chilean Miner, a forgotten Chilean Miner emerging a week after everyone else has left from the ground

9
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:15,520
This is my brother. My brother may emerging from the depths of ignorance to deliver weak old wisdom straight

10
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:23,020
To your dome. Do you think like six weeks after the celebration someone looked around and said have you guys seen sleepy Tim?

11
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:25,240
We're sleeping too shit

12
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:28,800
Nice nice skinny Tim

13
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:32,720
Lonely Tim

14
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:36,520
Tim Tim is actually a very common name in Chile

15
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:38,520
You guys may not know that

16
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:44,320
Chile it's not it's not they weren't let lost in a mine inside one of the members of TLC

17
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:48,600
No, they were lost in a Chili's restaurant

18
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:52,440
They needed to be excavated from which I I mean

19
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:56,160
I can't blame them of all the places to get stuck in the ground for three months

20
00:01:56,160 --> 00:02:01,840
I mean, they're their chicken strips are really out of this world guys. I don't care how awesome this blossom is

21
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:04,640
I'm gonna fucking flip if I don't get out of here soon

22
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:06,640
um

23
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:11,760
Wait, wait, wait awesome blossom is out back. What does Chili's have that they have a they have a

24
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:17,520
Version that is equitable to the awesome blossom. Anyway, the mediocre blossom

25
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:22,360
This is an advice show

26
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:26,760
Clearly I am your host and co-brother

27
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:31,320
I'm Travis McElroy. I'm Griffin McElroy

28
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:37,400
And and we are gonna get right into the the wisdom the growth as it were

29
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:40,520
I can't tell if this is gonna be a good one or a bad one

30
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:42,080
But let's find out together

31
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:46,360
One of my friends that I have known for years is a serious problem about washing his hands too much

32
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:52,100
He washes them every 30 minutes and as it gets colder outside his hands start to crack and bleed because they are dry

33
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:55,160
What should I do to get him to stop being a freak?

34
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:57,640
Kevin from Gmail Kevin

35
00:02:57,640 --> 00:03:01,480
Your friend isn't like he's not like kooky

36
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:06,460
What a crazy guy he got he's got Mark Summers itis

37
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:11,120
No, yeah, he's got the summer. He's got the double there

38
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:18,240
It seems kind of counterintuitive to me right like I wash my hands because they're dirty, but I wash them too much

39
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:22,080
So now they have blood all over them, which is like the dirtiest substance in the man

40
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:26,720
And as we all know you can wash all you want that blood's not coming off. No, never ever

41
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:31,240
No, the blood stays. Maybe you need to invest in some gloves

42
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:37,840
This is simple. The thing that worked for Mark Summers is something called immersion therapy

43
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:42,640
Where to get over the fact that you're really worried about getting dirty

44
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:46,200
They make you climb around in giant waffles covered in fake butter

45
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:51,440
And that you can fix them pretty good

46
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:54,480
So all you have to do is go to Nickelodeon

47
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:56,320
or

48
00:03:56,320 --> 00:04:01,800
What's what's Nickelodeon's parent company? Because I know Nickelodeon is like shut down. I gotta go to Viacom

49
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:04,200
I can show you where their office is in New York

50
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:07,680
You just go there and you you try and get him

51
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:09,880
arrange a

52
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:11,440
90s style

53
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:13,680
Game show with your friend as the host

54
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:14,280
Yeah

55
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:22,240
or Kevin you could realize that your friend has something called obsessive compulsive disorder and it's probably not gonna be fixed with a pat on

56
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:26,520
The back and a couple of concerned looks. In fact, don't pat him on the back. I don't think that'll help

57
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:33,440
I think that actually hurts the situation. Yes, that washes back. You can't hurt the situation. Look at those muscles. That guy's diesel

58
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:38,400
I think what you need to do is if you realize it's been a little over 30 minutes

59
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:42,040
Look at him go. Whoa, it's been 30 minutes better wash your hands or puppies are gonna die

60
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:45,040
Help keep him on schedule

61
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:49,400
That's all you can do is try to facilitate or just ridicule him endlessly

62
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:53,480
That's the only way I can really get friends to do other things. I know a lot

63
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:56,760
There are probably some people clucking their tongues out there and saying hey, that's a serious

64
00:04:57,400 --> 00:05:03,940
Listen, life's hard the fact that the guy washes his hands every half hour. It's not exactly debilitating. Okay, Howard

65
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:08,400
Look at Howard Hughes. Okay, he managed to still build the spruce goose

66
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:16,960
Yeah, but I mean think of all the life experiences that he's gonna miss out on now like he can't he'll never be able to hold

67
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:19,720
His newborn baby for longer than 30 minutes at a time

68
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:27,000
All things really when you're holding the baby things start to get really good around a minute 40

69
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:34,560
That's true. The connection is really is really real there all his fingerprints will look like rushed bullshit. I

70
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:42,440
See what you're going with for here, but you really could have needed to percolate a little bit more

71
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:47,200
Oh dear brothers, my girlfriend says I play Wow too much

72
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:51,440
I've lived with my girlfriend for eight years and started playing Wow a year ago

73
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:56,680
I play a few hours a day, but she wants me to stop so I haven't been on the dating scene for ten years

74
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:07,920
Yeah, my advice is to

75
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:15,580
What's Wow sometimes when I'm faced with decisions like this this very difficult decision. This man is clearly facing

76
00:06:15,580 --> 00:06:21,120
I'd like to pretend that I've traveled back in time from a few years in the future where I'm so

77
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:26,160
Cripplingly sad because of the decision I made and that by traveling back in time

78
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:29,200
I can manage to stop myself from doing that terrible thing

79
00:06:30,060 --> 00:06:36,640
Which is a long long way of saying don't do what you're thinking about doing you're talking about like present time travel, right?

80
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:38,640
Yeah, I'm talking about

81
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:43,640
Hypothetical future to present time travel. Okay. Yeah, I like that idea

82
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:47,800
I think it probably before it's gonna catch on you're gonna need to catch your name for it

83
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:50,960
I'd suggest immersion therapy, but the

84
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:53,640
But I I do like the premise here

85
00:06:54,920 --> 00:07:01,480
Form spring someday you are going to die and when you die you are not going to say to yourself gosh

86
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:03,480
I wish I

87
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:10,560
Had played Wow more you might however say I wish I hadn't dumped my girlfriend of eight years to play Wow more

88
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:12,680
which is maybe the same principle of

89
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:14,960
of

90
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:19,480
As Griffins, but I like to keep the taste of death in every mouth every moment

91
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:23,840
I think I think if you're thinking about your death your eventual death, you're always gonna make the best decision

92
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:27,920
You need to live like you're dying and then die like you're dying. Yes

93
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:31,080
Who's that pecan? What is that with that mild?

94
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:33,960
I thought that's got kind of a butternut

95
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:36,840
a

96
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:41,720
Definite deathy kind of coming. I'll do it. I'm getting a note of grave

97
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:49,720
Yeah, can I suggest proposing to your girlfriend of eight years get off in Wow

98
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:58,800
No, no, no, no, this can only go well don't listen to Griffin come here and look at the screen for a second

99
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:03,380
I know you don't play me. I buy you I buy your purple ring

100
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:09,160
It's amethyst. I changed the name of my guild to I love you Susan

101
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:19,320
My friend Tim and his girlfriend have a problem

102
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:23,760
They never stopped making out and groping each other in front of the rest of us

103
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:31,000
I'm gonna go ahead and submit that you're the problem. But let's go on. How do I go about stopping this at points?

104
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:36,920
It's downright annoying also talking to them about it and telling them how we feel does nothing. I need something a little more

105
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:40,320
Drastic

106
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:42,320
Thoughts Carlo

107
00:08:42,540 --> 00:08:44,000
Carlo no

108
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,080
Carlo

109
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:52,280
You do realize that you're trying to stay on the way of the most powerful force in the universe make right making out

110
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:53,760
a boner boners

111
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:54,200
Yeah

112
00:08:54,200 --> 00:09:00,840
You're trying to stop a man and a woman who I'm guessing from your description or under the age of 17

113
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:07,720
You're trying to get them to stop groping in public. We think you're gonna reinvent the wheel. Come on, Carlo and the full game

114
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:12,040
And does it say in pub? Okay, it is so they are doing it in public

115
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:18,200
For some people watching that happen. That's all they got. Yeah, that's all they have like yeah

116
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:25,400
It's some people and I'm not gonna go to malls and just like to just see the just see people

117
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:29,240
Just see people in love just express groping each other in a physical

118
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:31,120
manner

119
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:33,040
and public

120
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:35,840
Yeah in in public places like outside the gap

121
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:43,360
Some people need some people some people need that some people need it. No, they're wrong with that. I

122
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:46,600
Mean there is something wrong with it

123
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:50,040
It's there's something a little wrong with it, but I don't want to judge you my brother for Christ's sake

124
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:54,140
I mean not you of course. We're not talking about you hypothetical people hypothetical Griffin

125
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:58,440
some of us future present government some of us are

126
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:04,440
Coming up on 30 and like to be reminded of what it's like to feel and

127
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:07,280
Maybe Carlo you shouldn't

128
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:11,960
Get in the way of that. Maybe I say that's just every time you see it. Yeah, like

129
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:19,300
Oh, that's good. Oh, that's good, and then get go back in time. Go to Nickelodeon. She has get a container of GAC

130
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:32,120
What's up, what's this all over me you've been slimed maybe you see I'm making out just yell I got mixed

131
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:38,460
You can't do that in television, but you can't do it in my door room slimed. What's up? Just fire some kush balls at him

132
00:10:38,460 --> 00:10:42,020
All of a sudden they're on the Rosie O'Donnell show

133
00:10:45,540 --> 00:10:49,780
Cry minute Lee no, but really that you shouldn't do anything

134
00:10:50,580 --> 00:10:53,180
There's nothing you can do. I'll hate each other soon enough

135
00:10:53,180 --> 00:11:00,180
Yeah, and you don't want to you don't want to get in the way that I have this guy friend who to me is totally awesome

136
00:11:00,220 --> 00:11:04,420
That's in all caps. I don't think I can do it justice, but trust me. He's great

137
00:11:05,260 --> 00:11:06,220
funny

138
00:11:06,220 --> 00:11:07,380
chilly

139
00:11:07,380 --> 00:11:11,260
Left eye now T boss all that. Nope. Nope, those aren't in there

140
00:11:11,260 --> 00:11:17,900
The only he's chill all that the only problem is that to people that he isn't friends with he's just a total jerk

141
00:11:17,900 --> 00:11:22,700
Just the worst he's rude and downright unpleasant to be around. He's never violent or anything like that

142
00:11:22,700 --> 00:11:25,500
But still even though he's perfectly fine when he's hanging with me

143
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:29,580
I find a lot of friends kind of look down to me for hanging around him because of this. What should I do?

144
00:11:29,860 --> 00:11:33,340
Thanks devil's advocate gmail. I like it

145
00:11:33,340 --> 00:11:36,100
So is it like a

146
00:11:36,580 --> 00:11:41,820
Jekyll and Hyde kind of thing or is it just that you like his bad attitude and your friends don't

147
00:11:43,340 --> 00:11:47,900
No, I think it's I think it's one of those scenarios where once he gets surrounded by too many people

148
00:11:48,940 --> 00:11:56,340
He transforms into a monster. He gets he get I mean you gotta I think the thing to remember is that it stems from a place of

149
00:11:57,700 --> 00:12:01,060
Some people when they're when I'm around a bunch of people, I don't know very well

150
00:12:01,060 --> 00:12:04,500
I I tend to to kind of clam up a little bit. I get a little

151
00:12:05,140 --> 00:12:10,860
Social phobic and his is probably just manifesting in a different way. In this case. He gets he gets on the

152
00:12:11,740 --> 00:12:13,740
You know, he gets on the offensive

153
00:12:14,820 --> 00:12:18,740
That's what it sounds like to me. I I think the trick is to

154
00:12:20,020 --> 00:12:25,780
Try exposing him to one friend at a time, you know until he gets comfortable with

155
00:12:26,420 --> 00:12:28,420
Both of you and then eventually

156
00:12:28,420 --> 00:12:34,540
You gotta find that magic number so that if you're hanging out with three friends and you bring in a fourth and he's still cool

157
00:12:34,540 --> 00:12:39,860
And then you bring in a fifth and he's like girl Jews, you know, like no, okay

158
00:12:39,860 --> 00:12:42,420
Not not five more or under

159
00:12:43,180 --> 00:12:46,260
Right now you're attempting what's called immersion therapy

160
00:12:49,220 --> 00:12:56,100
I don't think it's working. It's not for everyone. It weren't for Mark Summers, but that doesn't mean it's gonna work for Jerko over here

161
00:12:56,100 --> 00:12:58,980
But that doesn't mean it's gonna work for Jerko over here. Yeah

162
00:13:00,660 --> 00:13:04,180
Don't you guys think one friend at a time until you're like more comfortable with the group

163
00:13:04,180 --> 00:13:08,780
I I think that's the only way you can get or like is this guy worth it like

164
00:13:09,260 --> 00:13:14,980
He doesn't sound very cool. He's totally awesome. Totally awesome. You don't know him like he knows him

165
00:13:15,620 --> 00:13:20,540
Would you like here's another suggestion and if you're hanging out with friends?

166
00:13:20,540 --> 00:13:26,740
And you want it to just look like it's you and him then hide your friends around the room

167
00:13:26,740 --> 00:13:30,940
I love they were hanging out in like they talked to you and he's like, what was that?

168
00:13:30,940 --> 00:13:34,180
You're like, I didn't hear anything. I didn't hear I don't know what you're talking about that

169
00:13:34,180 --> 00:13:38,860
But yes, Greg, I would like to go to the Baltimore and then once he's been awesome for a while

170
00:13:38,860 --> 00:13:45,140
Your friends can jump out and be like that that behavior is the kind of behavior you should exhibit around us

171
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:47,500
But are you scared? He's like fuck you

172
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:49,420
I

173
00:13:49,420 --> 00:13:52,660
Don't trust people. How could you do this to me Richard?

174
00:13:54,220 --> 00:14:01,500
Guts, here's a Yahoo Answers question and it's it was sent in by hybrid misfit. Thank you hybrid misfit

175
00:14:02,140 --> 00:14:06,060
It's from Yahoo Answers user sick Nick who asks

176
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:08,500
How can I make my rapping better?

177
00:14:10,340 --> 00:14:12,060
He has a very unique problem though

178
00:14:12,060 --> 00:14:17,980
He says when I rap I get a lot of saliva in my mouth and I don't sound when it happens

179
00:14:18,060 --> 00:14:21,380
How can I change that and can you give me other suggestions?

180
00:14:22,060 --> 00:14:29,180
Well, I mean, let's not put the cart before the horse. You need to handle your saliva situation first and foremost, right?

181
00:14:30,260 --> 00:14:31,780
I

182
00:14:31,780 --> 00:14:35,940
Think you should maybe just incorporate it into your into your act

183
00:14:35,940 --> 00:14:41,860
Well, yeah, well that's been a popular strategy. You ever wonder where Big Daddy Brawny came from

184
00:14:42,420 --> 00:14:47,060
Why people call him that is because he raps with a giant wad of paper towels in his mouth. Yeah

185
00:14:48,180 --> 00:14:54,920
DJ mumbles DJ mumble mouthful of cotton balls cotton balls. Yeah, DJ. How about just DJ Cudd?

186
00:14:56,700 --> 00:14:58,700
Kid Cudd kid Cuddy

187
00:14:59,620 --> 00:15:02,860
That's how he got his name. That's how he got his name exactly

188
00:15:02,860 --> 00:15:09,340
Uh, you might remember MC silica gel is actually actually died because you're not supposed to put silica gel on your mouth

189
00:15:09,340 --> 00:15:13,540
But you get that you get the idea. I mean went young but god those rhymes

190
00:15:13,940 --> 00:15:15,700
So it's so dry

191
00:15:15,700 --> 00:15:21,660
It's hard to corner the rap market nowadays because you have to be doing you have to have something new

192
00:15:22,820 --> 00:15:24,980
like for instance, I think

193
00:15:25,780 --> 00:15:30,180
Kanye West does it just with you know, really clever rhymes and catchy beats

194
00:15:30,180 --> 00:15:37,340
I'm being crazy and being crazy and and soldier boy does it by being really super untalented which is

195
00:15:38,300 --> 00:15:45,420
Itself kind of you know unique. So I think what you can do is just have a lot of spit in your mouth while you're rapping

196
00:15:45,940 --> 00:15:47,860
Yeah, like

197
00:15:47,860 --> 00:15:52,180
Julie DJ Julie something. There's something along those lines jaw drool

198
00:15:52,820 --> 00:15:56,660
Yeah drool. Uh-huh. And all your lyrics could be about it too

199
00:15:56,660 --> 00:16:01,500
Like when I spit rhymes, you know, you'll really get wet something like that. Oh my god

200
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:06,040
This is you will get wet. You may get soaked the names kids slimy. Don't you never forget?

201
00:16:09,020 --> 00:16:13,780
Can you can you give me four more lines, let me say let me see what I got in here

202
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:22,140
When I'm done with you kids you're gonna need a towel I'm gonna open your eyes I'm gonna empty your bowels

203
00:16:22,140 --> 00:16:27,540
Is that two lines that's two lines that's two lines

204
00:16:29,820 --> 00:16:32,780
When I'm on the MIC things will never be dry

205
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:39,880
Come on you can do this. You've almost got it Justin Justin

206
00:16:40,780 --> 00:16:42,780
I'm gonna dampen your shirt and spit in your eye

207
00:16:45,580 --> 00:16:47,580
Okay

208
00:16:47,580 --> 00:16:51,540
Ah form spring says, okay

209
00:16:52,180 --> 00:16:59,620
All right. My older brother is balding. He tries to hide with hats hoodies bonnets, etc

210
00:17:01,420 --> 00:17:06,340
Unfortunately, he cannot rock a hat and is wearing a hoodie indoors makes him look like a rapist

211
00:17:07,620 --> 00:17:11,300
How do we get him to get right with his MPB?

212
00:17:11,980 --> 00:17:13,980
form spring I

213
00:17:13,980 --> 00:17:18,060
Don't like that male pattern baldness, okay

214
00:17:18,900 --> 00:17:24,740
I think last just to clarify last week. I think we covered no one can rock a hat

215
00:17:25,100 --> 00:17:29,820
No, you can have you can wear a hat and sometimes you can't even do that. Yeah

216
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:33,300
Sometimes you're just barely wearing a hat

217
00:17:34,140 --> 00:17:39,260
You need to explain to your brother that we are in a time period now. We're bald people are awesome

218
00:17:39,260 --> 00:17:45,900
Yeah, it's the most socially acceptable bald as ever been. I think I agree. I think he's just shave it and call it a day

219
00:17:45,900 --> 00:17:49,820
Was that is that because of Moby you think because I might be mainly

220
00:17:49,820 --> 00:17:54,440
I think Moby is the really the one that turned it around because I mean it was cool to be bald and like

221
00:17:54,580 --> 00:17:59,540
55 but Moby was like nah dog. I'm 22 and now I have a bald head

222
00:17:59,540 --> 00:18:04,460
I remember in that interview where Bruce Willis was like, thank God for Moby. Thanks for me

223
00:18:04,460 --> 00:18:11,500
Okay, the thing is the the step one to getting your sexy right is always acceptance

224
00:18:11,700 --> 00:18:13,700
You gotta accept who you are

225
00:18:14,020 --> 00:18:16,300
Wearing a hat and hoodie and bonnet. I

226
00:18:16,940 --> 00:18:18,940
hopefully not really a bonnet but

227
00:18:19,380 --> 00:18:21,100
Wearing that kind of stuff

228
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:26,700
That doesn't that doesn't that says I'm ashamed. Yeah of something that's utterly out of my control

229
00:18:27,660 --> 00:18:33,060
That's not sexy. You should say you're proud of it because it's something you got that most people don't

230
00:18:33,060 --> 00:18:34,500
uh

231
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:38,620
Shave your eyebrows and then walk around to Sam fuck you like just like that

232
00:18:39,420 --> 00:18:41,420
Point at I'm like, what's up with these?

233
00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:48,620
But then grow a huge beard a huge beard and break your own nose so that it's just slightly tilted to the left

234
00:18:48,620 --> 00:18:53,700
Whoa, I like this. Yeah, look we're doing like a willy-willy thing here. You're welcome

235
00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:57,300
There's a lot more than you paid for my friend gauge one of your ears

236
00:18:57,300 --> 00:19:03,880
Really big like I'm shrink the other one to shrink one ear entirely. I

237
00:19:05,240 --> 00:19:07,680
Guarantee you if you do that, no one will notice you are bald

238
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:10,840
Guaranteed

239
00:19:10,840 --> 00:19:16,880
But I think in short shave it just shave it get done with it one of the funniest guys

240
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:19,120
I know outside of my family brentel floss

241
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:25,000
You made that decision like just shaved his head so much cooler now great-looking guy very funny

242
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:31,060
Popular with the ladies. It's a look. It's a look that you need to you know convince your brother now

243
00:19:31,060 --> 00:19:33,060
How do you convince your brother to do it?

244
00:19:33,320 --> 00:19:38,040
You do it while he's sleeping and and probably try to get some facial hair just something down there

245
00:19:38,040 --> 00:19:40,720
You should shave his head and then glue that hair to his face

246
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:46,480
Yeah, I like it. I personally think that you shouldn't

247
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:50,920
Encourage him to go bald. I think I think I just I

248
00:19:50,920 --> 00:19:54,480
Can't you guys couldn't convince me to go bald is the thing?

249
00:19:54,480 --> 00:20:00,280
I'm thinking about it it from from the brothers perspective if you guys came to me or like hey, bro

250
00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:06,140
You got to get rid of that hair. There's there's no way. There's no force on earth that could Griffin force

251
00:20:06,140 --> 00:20:13,040
I can change your mind right now. Okay, if you shave your head you could shave three seconds off of your lap time in the pool

252
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:18,880
Damn it

253
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:23,100
Griffin I'm I'm afraid you've misunderstood the premise of the show see

254
00:20:23,300 --> 00:20:28,060
When you try to take our advice in the real world and apply them practically to your situation

255
00:20:28,060 --> 00:20:30,840
That's when things that's when the wheels really fall off

256
00:20:30,980 --> 00:20:35,140
The idea with my brother my brother me is that we give it an answer that'll have them saying hey

257
00:20:35,140 --> 00:20:39,040
Yeah, exactly. Why don't I just do that and then as soon as they try to apply it

258
00:20:39,040 --> 00:20:41,460
It all collapses around them like a castle made of lies

259
00:20:43,380 --> 00:20:47,760
We got a question from Steph via Gmail she says

260
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:49,240
I

261
00:20:49,240 --> 00:20:54,240
Just recently graduated from college at Berkeley and I packed my bags and moved away to the San Francisco

262
00:20:54,560 --> 00:21:00,480
Peninsula with my boyfriend for a job at Stanford our friends in Berkeley are too lazy to come visit us

263
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:03,840
We visit them and we have no friends on the peninsula

264
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:08,720
How do you meet people and make friends after college, especially 20-somethings?

265
00:21:08,760 --> 00:21:12,560
We're both nerdy people who like video board games and comic books

266
00:21:12,560 --> 00:21:18,040
Not video board games not like the clue VHS

267
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:21,760
Baker Street Nightmare and comic books

268
00:21:22,360 --> 00:21:24,560
We prefer to meet other well-adjusted nerds

269
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:30,660
The problem with this is that most nerds I've met are single men and are awkward and uninterested when we approach them as a couple

270
00:21:30,680 --> 00:21:33,140
But try to ask me out when I don't have my boyfriend around

271
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:37,820
It's happened recently. Yeah gross when I went to a local board game shop and ask if they had a game night

272
00:21:37,820 --> 00:21:43,800
We don't need to meet nerds, but we also want to have some stuff in common with our future fantastic friends

273
00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:52,240
That is a tough question. Yeah, it's like it's like a treatise of everything. That's that's wrong with with the nerd culture, right?

274
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:56,980
Yeah, it's it's a nice summation of everything. That's terrible. Yeah, I mean

275
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:01,760
If it's any indication

276
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:09,240
The the questions that we get apparently all nerdy people are nervous about talking to all other nerdy people. Yeah

277
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:14,040
Ooh, ooh, wait a minute. Okay. I've got it. You don't

278
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:20,480
You need to realize that nerdy couples are still made of two nerdy people

279
00:22:20,520 --> 00:22:25,880
They're gonna feel just as uncomfortable as they did in the main. We were in another mating process here

280
00:22:26,040 --> 00:22:29,140
This is this is an amazing negotiation

281
00:22:29,140 --> 00:22:31,540
even that doesn't end with

282
00:22:34,620 --> 00:22:39,820
Conception it ends with inception inception and going

283
00:22:43,420 --> 00:22:48,040
It ends with you know, sitting around a table and playing some less on earth something something nerdy

284
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:52,980
The fact of the matter is that making friends

285
00:22:52,980 --> 00:22:58,820
meeting new people that will then become like friends and not like acquaintances but straight-up friends is

286
00:22:59,020 --> 00:23:02,140
More difficult than meeting members of the opposite sex

287
00:23:02,140 --> 00:23:06,180
I think it's also more difficult than once you're in a couple

288
00:23:06,580 --> 00:23:10,860
Because I think when you're solo you can sort of make those negotiations a lot easier

289
00:23:10,860 --> 00:23:14,460
You can pretend to be somebody you're not when you're flying by yourself

290
00:23:14,460 --> 00:23:18,740
But when you're in a couple, it's sort of like that person's gonna know what's up and you know

291
00:23:18,740 --> 00:23:21,500
They've got to like the situation you're in too

292
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:23,500
Mm-hmm. That's intimidating

293
00:23:23,500 --> 00:23:26,300
I mean if you're looking for people to meet at a bar

294
00:23:26,300 --> 00:23:30,860
You don't go to the couple that's sitting by themselves at a table like hey guys, what's up?

295
00:23:30,860 --> 00:23:34,540
Are you having the buffalo wings? Huh? Let me get down on let me just snack

296
00:23:35,420 --> 00:23:40,860
Well, I I stand by that as far as meeting friends. You always do good meeting people at work

297
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:42,380
meeting people

298
00:23:42,380 --> 00:23:49,780
You know at hobbies that you're both doing like if you if you guys join a pottery class or go to a coffee shop or something

299
00:23:49,780 --> 00:23:54,220
Like that anything like that where it's not just random strangers, but people, you know

300
00:23:55,220 --> 00:23:57,980
But that doesn't always mean you're gonna meet the best people

301
00:23:58,940 --> 00:24:03,600
Because you're limited to the people that are in that group, but it's you know people

302
00:24:04,500 --> 00:24:08,160
You at work put up a political flyer on campus. It says

303
00:24:08,780 --> 00:24:15,220
Hey, we're is anybody want to play some board games or something together for couples only a couple nerd night and then

304
00:24:15,220 --> 00:24:19,100
I'm not gonna make it sound so sad though. Yeah, that's

305
00:24:19,940 --> 00:24:21,980
That's an awfully tight filter to put on that

306
00:24:21,980 --> 00:24:28,060
I think maybe just a flyer with your personal phone number and the message who wants to party

307
00:24:29,740 --> 00:24:35,940
Looking to share fun with another couple. Yeah, something like that like something very open and honest and

308
00:24:36,700 --> 00:24:42,620
Looking for open couple to share with other open couple. That's good because you want open honesty

309
00:24:42,620 --> 00:24:44,780
and big and big

310
00:24:45,940 --> 00:24:51,820
Couple looking for other couple for a foursome, but then in much smaller letters for Scrabble

311
00:24:52,620 --> 00:24:53,860
maybe

312
00:24:53,860 --> 00:24:57,220
You know and you want to go back and forth between a few different games

313
00:24:57,220 --> 00:25:02,200
So make sure that they're willing to swing you want to say that in the flyer like looking for couple

314
00:25:02,900 --> 00:25:04,900
open-minded couple willing to swing

315
00:25:05,460 --> 00:25:10,420
And maybe you can play that hot new board game from Mattel key party. Yeah

316
00:25:10,420 --> 00:25:12,620
Okay down for a key party

317
00:25:13,140 --> 00:25:18,340
Maybe a convention would be good some sort go to comic-con or something and look for

318
00:25:18,980 --> 00:25:20,140
women

319
00:25:20,140 --> 00:25:23,020
Dressed as superheroes because you know, they didn't do that on their own

320
00:25:25,460 --> 00:25:27,460
That's just science

321
00:25:28,220 --> 00:25:35,500
Seth I'm sorry that we don't have more practical help for you here this I mean Jesus if I knew this then like

322
00:25:35,500 --> 00:25:41,860
We need to listen to another podcast like my brother my brother my brother my brother and me

323
00:25:42,060 --> 00:25:44,340
Where am I super well-adjusted uncle?

324
00:25:49,020 --> 00:25:51,420
The only thing they do on that show is give us advice

325
00:25:52,220 --> 00:25:58,020
And and they could tell me how to do this because I'm right there in the same boat except I'm starting to realize that

326
00:25:58,460 --> 00:26:04,620
Everyone's kind of just floating through this void of nobody knows how to talk to anybody else

327
00:26:04,620 --> 00:26:10,820
Like you know, we just get so many questions about how do I start conversations? How do I meet people?

328
00:26:11,660 --> 00:26:18,740
Everybody we are not solitary beings and people that feel solitary is because they are the most afraid

329
00:26:19,260 --> 00:26:22,820
Unless you're on the reality show solitary and then you're yes alone

330
00:26:23,780 --> 00:26:26,620
You might you might trust I know this seems like

331
00:26:27,460 --> 00:26:32,580
Counterintuitive considering what we just talked about but you might try Facebook. There's certainly there's got to be some like

332
00:26:32,580 --> 00:26:38,540
San Francisco gaming groups on Facebook. Maybe go there and say hey, we're looking for couples to

333
00:26:39,660 --> 00:26:41,660
to hang out with

334
00:26:41,740 --> 00:26:46,300
The trick is the area for couples. The trick is to just find that one couple

335
00:26:46,420 --> 00:26:50,540
Yeah that you can be cool with and then they know eight or nine other couples

336
00:26:51,100 --> 00:26:53,100
Especially they've lived on the San Francisco Peninsula

337
00:26:53,980 --> 00:26:55,980
for a while

338
00:26:55,980 --> 00:27:01,580
Uh, hey move in ma'am. I'm always always hungry

339
00:27:02,700 --> 00:27:08,380
There literally isn't a time when I couldn't eat. I'm not a fat guy, but I fear I may become one

340
00:27:09,180 --> 00:27:14,500
Keep up the what should I do? Keep up the amazing work, especially the deep voice guy who isn't Justin or Griffin?

341
00:27:14,500 --> 00:27:21,740
I like him Harrison Gmail. I like you too Harrison Harrison. I do want to clarify for you. That is how people become fat guys

342
00:27:21,740 --> 00:27:29,340
So that's not like a fear like something ephemeral that may like no you won't you that won't happen

343
00:27:29,340 --> 00:27:34,100
I'm afraid of ghosts and also that I'll get fat if I eat too much food

344
00:27:35,420 --> 00:27:37,420
What a fear? Yeah

345
00:27:37,940 --> 00:27:42,740
I I know that I feel the same way I as we have discussed

346
00:27:43,300 --> 00:27:47,360
Previously, I could literally always eat something at any point in the day

347
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:54,760
But really that is because a lot of the time I'm just massively bored and usually boredom leads to hunger. So maybe

348
00:27:55,320 --> 00:27:58,000
Try some food instead of a sandwich

349
00:27:58,840 --> 00:28:00,760
Mm-hmm

350
00:28:00,760 --> 00:28:02,760
Get a Gameboy

351
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:07,000
All of these things help oh my god Harrison you have a tapeworm

352
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:13,040
Harrison you have a tapeworm you have to go to the doctor but wait if he has a tapeworm

353
00:28:13,040 --> 00:28:17,760
Then he won't get fat right because it takes all the food for him

354
00:28:18,520 --> 00:28:24,080
But the tapeworm will eat all the food before he can digest it and use its energy and he'll eat all the good food

355
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:28,960
Too what if he's pregnant? Oh my god, Harrison with a tapeworm

356
00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:35,600
Pregnant with a tapeworm baby. Oh god. I shall name him Philip

357
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:42,960
He is my tapeworm baby, and I love him. It's just like that movie jr

358
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:51,880
Except he is a tapeworm and Noah Arnold Schwarzenegger. He's always hungry. So it's just like the movie jr. Except for the tapeworm, but I

359
00:28:52,760 --> 00:28:59,680
Went to the Sears. I went to the Sears baby department and they had no clothes that would fit my tapeworm, baby. I

360
00:29:00,560 --> 00:29:01,880
ended up

361
00:29:01,880 --> 00:29:06,600
With a pantyhose for super skinny ladies. That's what I had to walk out of there with

362
00:29:06,600 --> 00:29:12,280
Can you imagine the look on Philips face when I hand him that I sewed a little ducky on to it

363
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:19,680
Still don't think it's gonna fly but I love him and he is my child and he is going to go to college

364
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:22,900
And I'm planning a playdate with my neighbor's monkey, baby

365
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:26,560
Harrison Harrison don't eat anymore

366
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:29,200
just pump the brakes like

367
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:33,200
I'm something to do that takes up hours of the day that you

368
00:29:34,360 --> 00:29:40,600
The fact that you are not fat guy yet does not make you special like yeah fat people feel that way, too

369
00:29:40,600 --> 00:29:44,200
That's why they're fat like it's not like what how could this happen?

370
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:49,480
Like this is how it happens that you start out this way and then you eat so much that you turn fat when you're fat

371
00:29:49,480 --> 00:29:55,800
You can you can go back and you can chart out a history of double downs that made you what you are now

372
00:29:55,800 --> 00:30:01,820
Get it. Listen Harrison. Just pump the brakes. Listen to my brother Griffin. Just slow it down if you want to eat something

373
00:30:03,280 --> 00:30:05,280
Lots of people just don't away

374
00:30:06,040 --> 00:30:08,240
It could be that the food you're eating is too good

375
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:10,000
Did you try eating healthy food?

376
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,160
Cuz if you only have healthy food in the house

377
00:30:12,360 --> 00:30:16,400
Then you won't want to eat as much because it doesn't taste or or just get moderately poor

378
00:30:17,320 --> 00:30:23,000
Yeah today to the point where you can't really afford a lot of food. Oh

379
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:26,840
Oh, that's good. I like that. But then you'll start eating out of the garbage

380
00:30:27,160 --> 00:30:28,360
Yeah, don't do that

381
00:30:28,360 --> 00:30:33,720
Like a giant raccoon the tapeworm will wrap around it Philip will wrap around his brain and make him go to the garbage

382
00:30:33,720 --> 00:30:38,320
It's pretty good. I'm starving. I have a Yahoo answer that

383
00:30:39,040 --> 00:30:43,880
It kind of goes against one of our our core tenets here at my brother my brother and me

384
00:30:43,880 --> 00:30:49,560
But it's I feel like it's gonna open up a really interesting dialogue between the three of us

385
00:30:49,560 --> 00:30:53,520
So I think it might be worth the the infraction against our own rules

386
00:30:54,080 --> 00:30:58,240
Okay, but if I read the title and you guys don't want to go ahead with it

387
00:30:58,240 --> 00:31:01,160
Like I'll totally understand it won't hurt my feelings at all

388
00:31:02,340 --> 00:31:04,340
it was sent in by

389
00:31:04,800 --> 00:31:08,600
Listener Benjamin Carl the man so nice. They named him twice

390
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:14,840
And the the question itself was crafted by Floyd brewer who asks I?

391
00:31:14,840 --> 00:31:22,040
Am trying to get my son trained to defecate in a bag instead of a toilet or diaper any suggestions or tips

392
00:31:24,440 --> 00:31:27,880
My wife and I are very environment conscious and have been thinking

393
00:31:31,400 --> 00:31:35,560
He hasn't potty trained yet and we don't really want him formally trained to use a toilet

394
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:42,480
Which we believe wastewater and drains resources my wife and I started my wife and I started going in bags

395
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:50,000
about two years ago, and we use the excrement blended with other materials to fertilize our garden and

396
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:51,520
also and

397
00:31:51,520 --> 00:31:55,040
Also, sell it to friends for extra spending money

398
00:31:58,800 --> 00:32:03,760
But we have problems getting him to squat and be patient enough to go how can we encourage it?

399
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:05,760
How can we encourage him prizes?

400
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:08,560
punishment

401
00:32:08,560 --> 00:32:14,880
What is work for you you shit in that bag or so help me Derrick so help me if you don't shit in that bag

402
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:17,680
Derrick you shit in that bag or you are grounded

403
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:20,320
Hey, I'm someone's

404
00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:28,880
I'm sorry weirdo, but what punishment are you gonna levy against this child that even approaches the social punishment of going to school the first day

405
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:31,280
Asking the teacher where you can go shit in the bag

406
00:32:31,280 --> 00:32:33,280
Excuse me, where is the shit bag room?

407
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:35,280
He totally pre-empted that

408
00:32:35,280 --> 00:32:41,360
Because in the additional details, he says he won't need a bag to be packed into his backpack because he will be home-schooled

409
00:32:41,920 --> 00:32:47,600
Again, he doesn't have to worry about being made fun of because he will be home-schooled bitch. Listen

410
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:53,920
It doesn't school. That's a that's one one part of that kid's life. How about mall?

411
00:32:53,920 --> 00:32:58,000
How about next time he goes to the mall? He's at the arcade and he feels like deuce coming and he has to bag it

412
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,000
Right there. Where's your bag dispenser?

413
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:08,880
Where's your bag dispenser? What about the first time he goes to the produce department the grocery store and gets confused as fuck?

414
00:33:09,680 --> 00:33:16,080
Hey, where's this human shit? Where and and who made it? Is that like an in-house thing that you guys you guys provide?

415
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:18,000
Is that a service?

416
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,720
There's one nugget. Pardon the pun of this

417
00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:23,360
question that sticks in my head and that is

418
00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:26,080
selling

419
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:28,160
Sticks in my hair at what?

420
00:33:28,160 --> 00:33:33,440
Selling it to their friends for extra spending money. Who the fuck are your friends?

421
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:39,680
Is there a jar somewhere that they just slide their extra their extra change into that they got from selling their human shit?

422
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:44,240
To their very real friends and when that jar gets full they go to disney world

423
00:33:45,680 --> 00:33:48,000
Um, this is human poop we're talking about

424
00:33:49,040 --> 00:33:52,000
If you really want to help your child, here's how you do it

425
00:33:52,800 --> 00:33:54,800
You put the child on a porch

426
00:33:54,800 --> 00:34:00,240
You scatter your fecal matter around your home and you burn it down with you inside it

427
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:08,000
There is literally no way that child could be better off than you and your wife doing the right thing here

428
00:34:08,720 --> 00:34:12,640
And burning your house down with you inside it. It is the only choice you have

429
00:34:12,880 --> 00:34:15,840
I don't know that this is true, but I have to imagine that

430
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:19,040
child protective services

431
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:22,560
Goes through the internet looking for things exactly like this

432
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:27,680
Nah have to right? This is cool. I mean, it's pretty much a science project if you think about it

433
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:35,600
Nah, it's that green movement. You can't get the you can't child protective services isn't gonna do shit about more like a brown movement

434
00:34:37,600 --> 00:34:40,480
You monster hey, it looks like you're just

435
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:43,520
cupping your child's naked bottom with your hands

436
00:34:43,680 --> 00:34:48,400
No, it's cool. I have a bag bag here and i'm trying to get it to poop in the bag

437
00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:50,560
The little bastard just won't do it

438
00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:54,100
He thinks he's too good for pooping in a bag punishment

439
00:34:54,860 --> 00:34:57,840
Punishment what punishment you're gonna rub his nose in it

440
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:01,760
Fuck did you just honey? Did you just hear a flush?

441
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:06,080
Derek Derek, did you bring a toilet into this house?

442
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:09,040
What?

443
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:11,440
You know, it is such a fine line

444
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:18,320
Children cannot be the defining line between crazy person and unconventional parent

445
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:23,760
You can't just cross the line because you had a kid. You can't just be like no now i'm normal

446
00:35:24,160 --> 00:35:28,560
I just want to teach my child different things. You're still a crazy person

447
00:35:29,120 --> 00:35:30,880
You're still insane

448
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:32,880
It's 2010 dog

449
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:39,280
It's 2010 and it worries me that there's another person in this world. There is more than one person

450
00:35:39,360 --> 00:35:42,640
There are two people and they found each other that find it. Okay to poop in a bag

451
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:50,560
Hey, if you're worried about finding your special somebody it'll never happen. Look at these two fuck ups. Um, do you think it's okay for them to

452
00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:56,560
To make pee in a toilet to make water now they go to the garden

453
00:35:57,520 --> 00:36:00,160
That can't be good for the plants. It's terrible for the plants

454
00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:00,640
What do they care?

455
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:06,560
I need to find out what state these people live in and never buy any produce that came from that state because maybe that's how

456
00:36:06,640 --> 00:36:11,200
Shit rolls in montana. Like maybe that's maybe that's a common thing there. Why?

457
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:18,320
Why literally this this this question is indicative of my my terrible fear that there are giant parts of the country that I know

458
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:20,400
Nothing about where things like this happen

459
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:23,280
Or there's just poop everywhere. Did you want to?

460
00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:28,880
Thank you for coming to the farmers market. Did you want to buy some of my plums? They're really dope

461
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:34,400
I fertilize them with my friend's fecal matter. They're currently training their kid to not just my friend

462
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:40,480
It's my friend's son's fecal matter and it gives the the eggplants here. It just they're so firm

463
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:45,760
They're so so firm so for the skin is so tight. I'm so disgusted right now

464
00:36:46,240 --> 00:36:48,480
What could be like you've got it?

465
00:36:49,120 --> 00:36:51,280
People like this kind of pull the camera back

466
00:36:52,080 --> 00:36:54,880
You're worried about the planet cool. Why?

467
00:36:55,280 --> 00:37:00,160
Well, we're gonna have kids on this planet someday and we want to take care of it for them cool

468
00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:05,520
did you know your kid doesn't care if it's seven degrees hotter in july because they're

469
00:37:06,300 --> 00:37:08,800
Experiencing that heat while pooping in a bag

470
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:13,280
Isn't the whole point of it to make the world a better place for your kid?

471
00:37:13,680 --> 00:37:19,280
You actively do that by inventing toilets categorically a worse place because of your son

472
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:23,840
Yeah, because you have a son that's pooping in a container. That's not a toilet

473
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:28,320
Forget about the world for him. Like I don't care about this kid anymore. He's dead to me

474
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:31,440
Nothing's coming good out of this but

475
00:37:32,640 --> 00:37:36,000
Here here's here's a new game. I want to start playing on. Um

476
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:38,080
Um, my brother my brother me

477
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:41,680
And it's called things. You never hear the president say

478
00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:47,680
And number one on my list is yeah, my parents trained me to poop in a bag

479
00:37:49,120 --> 00:37:51,120
But I basically they did it

480
00:37:51,840 --> 00:37:56,240
Through a punishment regimen. That was it was very it was strict but fair

481
00:37:56,880 --> 00:37:57,920
Yeah

482
00:37:57,920 --> 00:37:59,840
I don't want to know what that entails

483
00:37:59,840 --> 00:38:00,400
Yeah

484
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:06,240
Um, the idea of this is still like it's gonna haunt me I think because I think the world is different now for me

485
00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:07,760
a little bit

486
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:11,200
Because because there are people like this. This is not a guy who's fucking with us

487
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:14,720
Like this is a real guy in the world somewhere

488
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:19,440
There's a couple that made eye contact one night and said, you know, honey

489
00:38:19,520 --> 00:38:25,200
I've been thinking about it and i've the decision is made it's time for us to start pooping in bags

490
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:28,880
How do you bring that up with your loved one? Like do you?

491
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:30,400
Do you

492
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:35,120
See them going to the toilet one day and just go there's a better way, you know, i've been thinking

493
00:38:36,560 --> 00:38:39,280
Wait a minute. I'm wasting a lot of water here. Um

494
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:43,040
Follow me. Let's just follow me. Maybe just bag it

495
00:38:43,840 --> 00:38:46,480
Because that doesn't waste any resources. That's a thank god

496
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:51,200
If you didn't want to waste if you didn't want to waste resources, you would just go shit directly on your crops

497
00:38:51,840 --> 00:38:53,040
Just go shit

498
00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:57,680
Directly out on your flower bed instead of doing what you're doing right now, which is shitting directly on your kid

499
00:38:57,680 --> 00:39:01,840
I mean, I have one question for you paper or plastic

500
00:39:02,860 --> 00:39:04,860
Delicious. Ah, hey

501
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:10,400
Uh, i'm gonna stick with burning your house down with you inside it. Um, but not the kid. It's not the kid's fault

502
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:13,280
Except if he does it if he does this crazy thing

503
00:39:13,280 --> 00:39:17,280
You're telling him to do then he's not made of strong enough stock to survive in this world

504
00:39:17,360 --> 00:39:22,560
We live in although he will be the best hobo. He will be the most conscientious hobo

505
00:39:22,720 --> 00:39:25,360
He'll be like the MacGyver of hobos

506
00:39:25,360 --> 00:39:27,440
He like toothless Jim will be like

507
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:33,840
Derek I thought you said you had to use the bathroom. He said I totally did. I did see that Wendy's bag. Don't go

508
00:39:34,560 --> 00:39:36,560
to that

509
00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:42,960
Not that bag or that bag or that bag that because I only do that in bags. That's my that's kind of my thing

510
00:39:43,040 --> 00:39:45,520
That's why they that's why they call me stink bag. Derek

511
00:39:46,080 --> 00:39:48,080

One giant plastic bag for everyone

514
00:39:58,160 --> 00:40:01,280
Oh, i'm so sad. I don't even want to like
