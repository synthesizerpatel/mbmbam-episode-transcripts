1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:30,800
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:51,520
I just got so scared, boys. Okay. That's not a joke. What is this energy?

6
00:00:51,520 --> 00:01:02,240
I've never been that. Yeah, that. No, no, no. You don't understand it.

7
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:13,760
What you make as a group when you all do that is a scary sound. It activates my fight or flight

8
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:23,520
response. And spoiler alert, my brain and body have never chosen fight. For McElroys, it is a

9
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:31,280
flight response. Yeah. Slider fart. Hello, everybody. Welcome to My Brother, My Brother,

10
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:34,800
a media advice show for the modern era. I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy.

11
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:47,200
I'm your middle brother, Travis McElroy. It's not a competition. It's not. I'm

12
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:59,680
piss pants terrified. I'm Griffin McElroy. All right. Much like so many years ago,

13
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:06,800
those Chilean miners emerged. They all love so much. We have returned here to the beautiful

14
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:14,640
is DC technically a city? Is that the right thing to say? Okay. The city of it's just a

15
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:20,480
loose conglomeration of humans. I'm hearing a hey, I'm hearing a lot of you yell different

16
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:26,240
things. And that's buckwild. Let's clamp that down. Taxation without representation. Am I right?

17
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:35,600
The nerve of these fat cats. Anyway, we are so excited to be here. Last night we did

18
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:44,240
the adventure zone and other podcasts. And well, the road, the road's tough. The road's hard on

19
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:51,840
all of us in different ways. This is got at this point. This is our second show, this tour

20
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:58,720
and the road and we're not as young as we used to be as you used to be. And last time I'm sad,

21
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:02,800
sad to report we did have an injury. Uh, Trav, do you want to talk about it?

22
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:11,360
I, after the show, I threw slap bracelets into the audience

23
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:15,280
and I threw them so hard. I hurt my arm.

24
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:20,800
We've heard about this injury, the slap bracelet injury that Travis sustained

25
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:26,000
quite a bit this evening. I watched, it hurts to do everything. I watched six episodes of

26
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:31,920
succession in my hotel room today. I have heard Travis talk about this injury more than I've heard

27
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:38,080
Brian Cox call his kids fuck wads. So it's like, it's that it hurts to do like, it hurts to undo

28
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:45,440
my belt to pee. And you wouldn't help me. Yeah, I know Travis. I asked you to help me pee.

29
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:49,680
We just wasted a lot of your time. We have horrible bodies. Let's get into the show.

30
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:53,120
They're all broken and nothing works. Riddle me, Piss Boys.

31
00:03:57,600 --> 00:04:03,440
You're just making it worse. You're just injured. Tis but a warm up. Okay, you don't have to do

32
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:09,120
this right. I won't do the voice for the actual riddle. Then get to the fucking riddle. But this

33
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:13,680
is tis but the intro. Now I want to actually hear the riddle now because it will put an end to this

34
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:20,880
misery. Okay, feed me riddle master. Now this, this riddle I picked solely for the answer. All right.

35
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:28,240
And I will read it, caps appropriately. Jesus Christ. If I say that I will give you a hundred

36
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:37,360
thousand dollars tomorrow, when will you get it? I'm going to say never. I'm going to say tomorrow.

37
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:42,320
Okay. This is, I'm going to read it word for word, caps punctual, and I'll scoot this back a little bit.

38
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:51,360
Never. Tomorrow never ever comes. It's always today.

39
00:04:51,360 --> 00:05:00,000
So now I understand the heart of this riddle, but if a human being said to me, I'll give you a hundred

40
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:04,640
thousand dollars tomorrow. And then the next day I said, I would like that a hundred thousand

41
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:10,640
dollars, please. And they said, ha ha, but tis not tomorrow. It is today. I'm like, fuck you, Dylan.

42
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:18,640
I'm like, fuck you, Dylan. I'm like, fuck you, Dylan. I'm like, fuck you, Dylan. I'm like, fuck you, Dylan.

43
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:23,760
I'm like, fuck you, Dylan. I'm like, fuck you, Dylan. I'm like, fuck you, Dylan. I'm like, fuck you, Dylan.

44
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:28,960
You told me yesterday, so it is now, and you do owe me a hundred thousand dollars.

45
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:35,120
This is a person that has seen that sign that's in every fine bar, the sign that says free beer

46
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:42,480
tomorrow. They saw that sign and thought, hmm, what a brain teaser. Yeah. The center of my next

47
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:51,280
conundrum. Or they went and saw rent and just did not fucking understand kind of the whole thesis.

48
00:05:52,640 --> 00:06:01,520
This riddle was written by a dog. It's never later. No day but today. I fucking told you guys,

49
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:06,960
didn't I? Told you. How about a question one? Can we do one of them? This is a question.

50
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:13,600
My dad is a hairy, hairy man. Start the question, Juice.

51
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:22,320
My dad's a hairy, hairy man. So hairy, it doesn't matter how high the neck on his shirt is. The hair

52
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:28,480
on his chest always manages to poke out of the top of his shirt. Been there. He has a tiny little

53
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:34,000
dog, very cute, and he frequently sends pictures of her. The problem is he sends selfies of him

54
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:39,600
and the dog from a low angle, revealing how shirtless and hairy he is with a very serious

55
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:44,880
dad face. How do I tell my dad to stop sending me shirtless pics so I can show my friends his cute

56
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:53,600
dog, but not my hairy dad with no shirt that's from desperate daughter? Are you here? All right.

57
00:06:53,600 --> 00:07:02,480
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you for your decisiveness. What's a serious dad face?

58
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:09,680
Okay, Trav, let's break down. We're in an audio medium, and also they are in a pitch black room

59
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:16,000
that we can't see. We've used our words to weave pictures before. Yeah, that's true. I think it's

60
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:27,680
kind of like this. Okay. God almighty. One of these phones we got now. Hey, what's the deal with

61
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:32,880
these phones these days? They've got to have some sort of crop functionality, yes? They have to have

62
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:39,600
some sort of content aware. That's one hairy daddy. That is feature where it just autofills with more

63
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:48,960
dog. This is a cute tiny dog with one enormous wild man-shaped lump on its back. That is true.

64
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:53,040
Like there's a thing that I can turn on that turns my head into a unicorn's head. There's

65
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:59,120
not something I can hit that instantly puts a shirt on your dad. I think next time your dad's

66
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:02,960
like, hey, I'm sending you a pic, just turn your phone around and hold it up like, guys, I got a

67
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:07,600
good dad pic coming in. You guys look first. I want to see what you all think. Or maybe just like cut

68
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:13,600
a tiny shirt out of construction paper and glue it to your phone. That's right. Get the crop exactly

69
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:21,840
right. Does your dad know? Were you like, hey, especially a low angle. Yeah. Hey, straight up,

70
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:31,360
nobody's accidentally taken a low angle selfie. He didn't trip on his skateboard and the shutter

71
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:39,120
button hit with himself perfectly framed rule of thirds. Like, I don't know why you're seeing this

72
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:43,440
as a problem. I say you set your dad up with an Instagram and let him make a million dollars.

73
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:52,160
Right. I've been on the internet and your dad's going to find his audience. I have very little

74
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:57,040
doubt about that. And the dog's hairy too. And you're not giving a shit about that. Thank you.

75
00:08:57,040 --> 00:09:02,240
Yeah. All animals. Think about it. I'm just saying, no matter how hairy your dad is,

76
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:09,280
not as hairy as that dog. Get him. Unless. Unless. Oh, no. Dad's got to get a bigger dog.

77
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:17,360
Solved it for you. Is your dad shirtless? I cannot tell. Can you get a dog that exactly

78
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:22,800
matches the color of his chest hair? Then it becomes like an I Spy poster.

79
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:29,760
If there's a dog in there, I swear, cross your eyes. Yeah. That's funny.

80
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:38,960
Thanks, Larry the Cable Guy. Lord, I apologize for our great...

81
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:43,760
There's a... Every time I drink wine on stage, and it's a new thing for me,

82
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:50,240
I'm an adult now and I like the stinky red beverage. But every time I do, bugs are like,

83
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:55,280
what's up? You doing a show? Can I get in that? And it's very distracting. I'm just going to

84
00:09:55,280 --> 00:09:59,120
drink a bug and not even worry about it. Free protein.

85
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:02,560
I got a Yahoo. Can I do a Yahoo? Yeah, bud.

86
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:08,480
So I'm going to send in by Seth Carlson. Thank you, Seth. It's Yahoo Answers user,

87
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:14,320
Soups, who asks. That's S-O-U-P-S. Not like Superman shorts.

88
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:19,760
You know what? It never crossed my mind. I assumed it was S-O-U-P-S.

89
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:25,120
Multiple Soups. Okay. His avatar is the Hamburglar. There's a lot going on with this.

90
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:32,080
Anyway, Soups asks, could a gorilla become a vampire?

91
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:47,120
Followed by, are vampires only human or can they be any mammals?

92
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:52,880
Wow. That actually opens up the door. Humans, bats.

93
00:10:55,440 --> 00:11:00,640
Travis couldn't think of a third mammal, everybody. No, hold on. I'm saying vampires

94
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:06,800
are already humans and bats. Oh, okay. Please stop yelling mammals or anything.

95
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:15,040
The better question is, how hungry does a vampire have to be?

96
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:25,200
Before he's like, oh, fuck. I have to eat something. Why did we come to this place

97
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:33,840
where there are so many gorillas? I'm going to do it, Vicky. I'm going to eat a gorilla.

98
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:39,360
It's the most dude-shaped animal.

99
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:47,760
Maybe it's the thrill at that point. It's like, humans, we're pretty easy.

100
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:49,600
We're fucking weak. We're weak.

101
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:53,200
I've seen a lot of vampire movies. Nine out of ten of us are easy to take down.

102
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:56,080
And I've had a lot of conversation about this. Statistically speaking,

103
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:59,360
about half of the people would be like, yeah, okay. It's all right.

104
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:03,520
And a gorilla is like, oh, if that gets you, though.

105
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:09,520
I kind of now want to see a gorilla fight a Dracula. That would be very good.

106
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:12,240
I think we've got a little old lady who swallowed a fly situation in our hands,

107
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:17,440
as we so often do on this show, where the gorillas are going to wipe out a lot of

108
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:20,720
the vampire population when they try to get froggy and leap.

109
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:26,080
Yes, but the few that succeed are going to make fucking vampire gorillas.

110
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:30,880
Hey, what are we going to vampirize to kill the vampire gorillas?

111
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:34,960
Hey, why stop there? What about a vampirino?

112
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:36,640
Vampirino is bad news.

113
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:38,320
They suck it through the horn.

114
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:39,840
Shit, dog.

115
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:43,520
They're not going to turn any humans, though,

116
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:46,240
because there's not going to be a vampire with a hole in its torso.

117
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:49,600
What about a vampire whale?

118
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:50,640
Vampire whale?

119
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:52,000
All that fucking baleen?

120
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:56,720
Oh, the baleen's just kind of sharp now.

121
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:58,400
Yeah, I'm just chilling in here like a hammock.

122
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:01,360
My juices are being drained, but...

123
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:03,920
There's a lot of vampire krill running around now.

124
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:07,600
If they do a vampire duckbill platypus, is it just going to gum you to death?

125
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:09,920
Is it going to be something on you?

126
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:12,320
Well, it already has poisonous spines on its feet.

127
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:16,080
Perhaps they just migrate up to its mouth now.

128
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:17,520
Gross.

129
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:20,160
Let me walk on you, Dylan.

130
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:21,360
Let me walk on your back.

131
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:22,560
Trust me.

132
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:24,400
How about another question?

133
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:25,040
Yes, my son.

134
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:26,340
What?

135
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:28,080
Twist.

136
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:29,520
It's a big reveal.

137
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:30,800
No one saw this coming.

138
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:32,000
So late in the shit series.

139
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:35,360
I was wondering if you have any advice on how to ask my friends

140
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:38,080
if I can massage them in a non-creepy way.

141
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:40,800
For the last year or so,

142
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:44,480
I have been watching massage tutorial videos on YouTube to relax before bed.

143
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:47,600
And I feel like I have gained a lot of knowledge on the subject

144
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:48,880
and want to practice the skills.

145
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:54,640
I don't want anyone to think I'm a creep or a weirdo.

146
00:13:54,640 --> 00:13:55,760
No danger of that.

147
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:59,040
I just think it would be a fun skill to have.

148
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:00,800
What do I do?

149
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:02,560
How can I offer this to my friends?

150
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:06,320
And that's from amateur massage therapist in Silver Spring.

151
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:06,880
Are you here?

152
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:09,040
Okay, hello.

153
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:14,240
Now, it occurs to me, as my older brother is reading this question,

154
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:17,520
that you've watched a lot of videos

155
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:23,120
and have done no practical, like, experience at all.

156
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:26,160
So you've watched and you've kind of moved your hands in the air.

157
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:30,400
I'm like, that's what I would kind of do on some skin.

158
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:31,120
That seems right.

159
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:33,440
It's like practicing a kiss on a teddy bear, isn't it?

160
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:35,520
Except there's no teddy bear.

161
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:36,320
You're just kind of...

162
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:39,600
Yeah, I just mouth in the air.

163
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:47,440
So, uh, you, I...

164
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:52,000
The way you're going to have to phrase it is,

165
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:58,160
can I massage you for the first time ever?

166
00:14:58,160 --> 00:14:59,440
I want to practice my art.

167
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:01,680
Well, hold on, because that makes it sound like

168
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:03,040
you have massaged other people,

169
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:04,880
but you are treating better people.

170
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:08,000
But you are treating them specifically for the first time.

171
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
You would have to phrase it something wild like,

172
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:15,440
can I, for the first time, massage and have it be you?

173
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:21,280
May I offer you my first ever massage?

174
00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:25,040
Wow, we all forgot syntax except for Travis up here for a bit.

175
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:26,000
But there is also, like,

176
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:31,440
if any one of my friends started a sentence with,

177
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:34,160
you know, I've been learning about massage,

178
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:37,280
they wouldn't finish before I was like, do it.

179
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:38,000
Do it, go.

180
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:41,200
Everything is stressful all the time.

181
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:42,880
I know 800 people.

182
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:45,760
And if any one of them came up to me and said,

183
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:47,200
do you want a massage?

184
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:48,160
I'd say, oh, absolutely.

185
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:49,120
Thank you so much.

186
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:52,320
And that's Justin who is rife with social anxiety.

187
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:54,880
Oh, that's not, I'll take a massage though.

188
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:56,640
That gets rid of all the anxiety.

189
00:15:56,640 --> 00:15:57,760
I mean, I hurt myself.

190
00:15:58,960 --> 00:15:59,760
Oh, Travis, yeah.

191
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:01,360
Hey bud, let me see that arm.

192
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:03,520
Yeah, I hurt myself throwing slap bracelets.

193
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:04,480
Is it this one?

194
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:05,840
It's both of them, Griffin.

195
00:16:07,760 --> 00:16:09,040
Here's some quick advice.

196
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:11,680
One, don't open with,

197
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:14,480
I'm not asking this in a weird or creepy way,

198
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:16,800
but that's number one.

199
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:22,240
Number two, massage is an art and a technique

200
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:25,040
and perhaps a science if I may be so bold.

201
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:26,800
I would maybe take a class.

202
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:29,840
It would be a fun, fun place to start.

203
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:33,040
Number three, if you're really serious and you say,

204
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:35,120
hey, I'm an amateur massage therapist

205
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:35,920
because aren't we all?

206
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:39,760
I'm an amateur massage therapist.

207
00:16:39,760 --> 00:16:42,800
My first fucking question is show me the table.

208
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:44,240
If you've got one of those weird tables

209
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:45,920
and I just looked on Amazon, they're $84.

210
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,360
And you know what that is, Justin?

211
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:50,000
An investment.

212
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,440
Investment in your future.

213
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:54,480
You could do all kinds of stuff on a massage table.

214
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:57,280
Why don't other pieces, fucking chill.

215
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:02,240
Okay, a list of some things you could do.

216
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:06,480
Number two, take a nap with a straw to a drink underneath.

217
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:08,560
Or just take a, hey everybody, we're all talking.

218
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:10,320
Do you sleep on your side or do you sleep on your back?

219
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:12,240
I sleep on my fucking front.

220
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:14,240
I sleep on my front with a hole for the head.

221
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:15,440
I watch TV.

222
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:16,640
I watch TV down there.

223
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:20,080
My TV's on the fucking floor, re-watching Breaking Bad.

224
00:17:20,080 --> 00:17:23,040
I fall asleep gently breathing through my good hole.

225
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:25,280
If I roll three inches either way, I die.

226
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,440
I am strapped to the bed.

227
00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:29,200
I'm strapped to the bed, yes, it's very safe.

228
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:32,160
It's the friend I trust.

229
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:35,040
What if you wake up and your butt looks awesome

230
00:17:35,040 --> 00:17:36,720
and everybody's like, your butt looks so awesome.

231
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:37,760
And you're like, yeah, I guess just,

232
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:39,200
you're not supposed to sleep on it.

233
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:41,360
We weren't supposed to sleep on it this whole time.

234
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:44,240
So yeah, it looks really cool and good.

235
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:46,640
Like, I look bigger and it looks good.

236
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:50,880
Are there not practice dummies?

237
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:54,560
One could, I know I'm saying it out loud.

238
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:57,440
No, this is good, Travis.

239
00:17:57,440 --> 00:18:00,080
They're rubbing them and they're like, oh, that's good.

240
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:01,600
Yes, excellent.

241
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:02,720
That is the spot.

242
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:04,000
That is perfect right there.

243
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,360
Whoa, whoa, no, not there.

244
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:08,240
Oh, oh, I can't move my legs.

245
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:09,760
I'm peeing forever now.

246
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:10,720
I'm peeing forever.

247
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:12,080
I'll never stop peeing.

248
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:17,040
And then it says, game over on the scoreboard.

249
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:20,240
Coming to arcades this far.

250
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:23,840
Massage, massage revolution.

251
00:18:24,560 --> 00:18:25,380
That's good.

252
00:18:25,380 --> 00:18:27,380
Rub rabbits.

253
00:18:27,380 --> 00:18:31,140
I, uh, Griffy, you wanna do another question?

254
00:18:31,140 --> 00:18:31,700
Yeah, sure.

255
00:18:31,700 --> 00:18:33,460
This one was sent in by Emma Kant.

256
00:18:34,340 --> 00:18:34,740
Thank you.

257
00:18:34,740 --> 00:18:36,580
It's an anonymous Yahoo Answers user.

258
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:42,660
So I'm gonna call them Jeremiah asks.

259
00:18:43,540 --> 00:18:45,380
My brain stopped working for a second there.

260
00:18:47,060 --> 00:18:49,940
Am I allowed to buy all the Super Bowl tickets

261
00:18:49,940 --> 00:18:56,660
to have the stadium to myself?

262
00:18:56,660 --> 00:18:59,540
This is Jeremy's big game.

263
00:19:00,900 --> 00:19:02,580
Have fun out there, guys.

264
00:19:03,540 --> 00:19:05,220
Go Broncos, go Jets.

265
00:19:05,220 --> 00:19:05,780
I don't care.

266
00:19:05,780 --> 00:19:08,660
Just have fun for Jeremy.

267
00:19:08,660 --> 00:19:10,260
Make it a good game.

268
00:19:10,260 --> 00:19:13,380
I have to think that this is an air bud situation, right?

269
00:19:13,940 --> 00:19:17,860
Where Jeremiah would roll up, say, here is, I don't know,

270
00:19:17,860 --> 00:19:20,660
$1.8 million or whatever.

271
00:19:20,660 --> 00:19:23,300
Probably considerably more than that.

272
00:19:23,300 --> 00:19:28,660
You think the gross take for the Super Bowl is $1.8 million?

273
00:19:28,660 --> 00:19:31,540
You think buying out the Super Bowl costs less

274
00:19:31,540 --> 00:19:33,860
than buying a commercial on the Super Bowl?

275
00:19:33,860 --> 00:19:39,620
You think if Coke could pay 50,000 dipshits

276
00:19:39,620 --> 00:19:41,060
to stand around in red and white shirts

277
00:19:41,060 --> 00:19:43,380
that spell out Coke they wouldn't in a fucking heartbeat?

278
00:19:43,380 --> 00:19:47,460
You're right, $2 million.

279
00:19:47,460 --> 00:19:49,220
Then I think that there will be a scenario

280
00:19:49,220 --> 00:19:51,300
in which the Super Bowl officials would go,

281
00:19:51,300 --> 00:19:55,460
what, I mean, wait, hold on, let us look.

282
00:19:56,500 --> 00:19:57,700
There's no rule against it.

283
00:19:58,260 --> 00:20:00,260
Yeah, it's your game now.

284
00:20:01,220 --> 00:20:04,660
I have to step in here and break out of the bit a little bit

285
00:20:04,660 --> 00:20:13,460
to say Travis's understanding of all law and order is defined

286
00:20:13,460 --> 00:20:15,220
by the air bud clause.

287
00:20:15,220 --> 00:20:23,220
Specifically, if there's not a rule against it, it's fine.

288
00:20:23,220 --> 00:20:25,620
Yeah, that's how new rules get written.

289
00:20:25,620 --> 00:20:26,420
There has to be that.

290
00:20:26,420 --> 00:20:28,260
To stop people like Travis.

291
00:20:28,260 --> 00:20:31,060
That's air bud six.

292
00:20:31,060 --> 00:20:34,420
It's like, the dog's gonna join this basketball team.

293
00:20:34,420 --> 00:20:35,300
No, they're fucking not.

294
00:20:35,300 --> 00:20:36,580
No rule against it.

295
00:20:36,580 --> 00:20:38,100
Okay, hey, guys, get together.

296
00:20:38,100 --> 00:20:39,620
I don't think dogs should be able to play basketball.

297
00:20:39,620 --> 00:20:41,620
Here, aye, aye, aye, aye.

298
00:20:41,620 --> 00:20:43,220
Yeah, so fuck off.

299
00:20:43,220 --> 00:20:44,180
That's actually-

300
00:20:44,180 --> 00:20:46,820
We used to only have the midnight amendments.

301
00:20:46,820 --> 00:20:49,620
So where we started was come on, be cool, nice.

302
00:20:49,620 --> 00:20:53,540
And then the Travis's of human civilization

303
00:20:53,540 --> 00:20:54,980
started pushing the boundaries.

304
00:20:54,980 --> 00:20:55,780
Well, this is what I'm saying.

305
00:20:55,780 --> 00:20:59,140
Maybe air bud seven is just like air bud on a search

306
00:20:59,140 --> 00:21:01,780
for things he hasn't been legally ruled out of yet.

307
00:21:01,780 --> 00:21:02,580
Yes.

308
00:21:02,580 --> 00:21:03,780
Can I be a doctor?

309
00:21:03,780 --> 00:21:07,380
No, we have a law against, oh shit, I'm gonna be a teacher.

310
00:21:07,380 --> 00:21:09,140
No, we got you there too, you asshole.

311
00:21:10,100 --> 00:21:12,420
We saw you coming a mile away.

312
00:21:12,420 --> 00:21:13,620
Can I be a firefighter?

313
00:21:13,620 --> 00:21:15,220
You can be like a firefighter mascot.

314
00:21:15,220 --> 00:21:16,580
I'm not exactly sure how it works.

315
00:21:16,580 --> 00:21:17,460
Ah, no rule.

316
00:21:17,460 --> 00:21:18,500
Ah, boom.

317
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:19,940
Spray, spray, spray, spray.

318
00:21:19,940 --> 00:21:21,220
I get to kill again.

319
00:21:21,220 --> 00:21:26,580
Because you can't send a dog to death row.

320
00:21:26,580 --> 00:21:27,940
It's not in the law books.

321
00:21:27,940 --> 00:21:30,180
One of the, you know, you're buying yourself

322
00:21:30,180 --> 00:21:31,860
all the tickets to the Super Bowl and that's great.

323
00:21:31,860 --> 00:21:33,220
But what you've also bought yourself,

324
00:21:33,220 --> 00:21:37,300
is a private concert from Shakira and Jennifer Lopez.

325
00:21:37,300 --> 00:21:38,020
Yes.

326
00:21:38,020 --> 00:21:39,620
Who are doing the halftime show this year.

327
00:21:39,620 --> 00:21:41,620
If we are the arbiters of this news to you.

328
00:21:41,620 --> 00:21:42,100
Yes.

329
00:21:42,100 --> 00:21:44,100
Lucky that Derek is small and humble,

330
00:21:44,100 --> 00:21:46,420
so I don't confuse him with mountains.

331
00:21:46,980 --> 00:21:48,020
What was his name?

332
00:21:48,020 --> 00:21:48,820
Derek.

333
00:21:48,820 --> 00:21:50,740
It didn't fit the meter very well.

334
00:21:50,740 --> 00:21:52,260
Waiting for Derek.

335
00:21:52,260 --> 00:21:53,220
Whoa.

336
00:21:53,220 --> 00:21:54,180
Is that better?

337
00:21:54,820 --> 00:21:56,980
Don't be fooled by the rocks that I got.

338
00:21:56,980 --> 00:21:58,980
I'm still Derek from the block.

339
00:22:00,340 --> 00:22:01,860
All the songs will be about Derek.

340
00:22:01,860 --> 00:22:03,300
They would all work for Derek.

341
00:22:03,300 --> 00:22:04,900
I will give you a hundred dollars

342
00:22:04,900 --> 00:22:07,860
if you name another Shakira song and fit Derek into it.

343
00:22:08,420 --> 00:22:08,900
Okay.

344
00:22:08,900 --> 00:22:12,660
I'm mounted not, you know Derek don't lie.

345
00:22:12,660 --> 00:22:13,860
Don't lie to me.

346
00:22:13,860 --> 00:22:15,060
That's the same song.

347
00:22:15,060 --> 00:22:16,900
That's, it's a different, no.

348
00:22:16,900 --> 00:22:17,860
No.

349
00:22:17,860 --> 00:22:18,900
That's the same song.

350
00:22:18,900 --> 00:22:20,020
You know, it's hard to say Trav.

351
00:22:20,740 --> 00:22:23,380
It's definitely a different part of the same song if anything.

352
00:22:23,380 --> 00:22:25,300
Okay, I'll give you $50.

353
00:22:25,300 --> 00:22:26,260
Thank you.

354
00:22:26,260 --> 00:22:27,220
Tomorrow?

355
00:22:27,220 --> 00:22:27,700
Tomorrow.

356
00:22:27,700 --> 00:22:33,860
Tomorrow.

357
00:22:33,860 --> 00:22:37,540
As a child, I, this isn't a question.

358
00:22:37,540 --> 00:22:37,860
Sorry.

359
00:22:37,860 --> 00:22:38,340
Oh.

360
00:22:38,340 --> 00:22:38,740
Should have.

361
00:22:39,300 --> 00:22:43,940
As a child, I stole a toy from a restaurant in Philadelphia.

362
00:22:43,940 --> 00:22:46,180
My mom found out and made me put it back

363
00:22:46,180 --> 00:22:47,940
and apologize to the owner.

364
00:22:47,940 --> 00:22:59,620
And while I was in there, I stole a different toy.

365
00:22:59,620 --> 00:23:03,780
She still doesn't know this was 10 years ago.

366
00:23:05,300 --> 00:23:06,740
It's still haunts me.

367
00:23:06,740 --> 00:23:07,620
Please help.

368
00:23:07,620 --> 00:23:12,900
And that's, that's from Liam who just used their name.

369
00:23:12,900 --> 00:23:16,740
No regard for their own safety.

370
00:23:16,740 --> 00:23:18,020
Liam, are you here?

371
00:23:18,020 --> 00:23:18,500
Yes.

372
00:23:22,500 --> 00:23:26,660
Liam, quick follow up question based on the subject line of the email.

373
00:23:26,660 --> 00:23:30,660
The toy in question, is it a Shrek toy?

374
00:23:31,780 --> 00:23:32,420
Yes.

375
00:23:32,420 --> 00:23:33,380
Liam says yes.

376
00:23:33,380 --> 00:23:34,020
That was a yes.

377
00:23:34,020 --> 00:23:34,820
That was a confirmation.

378
00:23:34,820 --> 00:23:36,660
That's a yes to the Shrek toy.

379
00:23:36,660 --> 00:23:38,180
Was it Donkey?

380
00:23:39,380 --> 00:23:39,940
What?

381
00:23:39,940 --> 00:23:46,180
The first was a Lightning McQueen toy.

382
00:23:46,180 --> 00:23:46,820
Holy shit.

383
00:23:46,820 --> 00:23:48,420
This was terrifyingly recent.

384
00:23:48,420 --> 00:23:53,540
What was, what was the second toy?

385
00:23:53,540 --> 00:23:54,340
Absolute silence.

386
00:23:56,980 --> 00:23:57,940
Was a Shrek action.

387
00:23:57,940 --> 00:24:00,580
So it was, you really trade it up.

388
00:24:00,580 --> 00:24:03,140
So yeah, up to the winning Dreamworks team.

389
00:24:03,140 --> 00:24:10,260
We are really stretching the definition of action with that one, huh?

390
00:24:10,260 --> 00:24:13,860
Watch as he uses his stay away from other people action.

391
00:24:15,220 --> 00:24:16,820
Wants to be left alone action.

392
00:24:17,940 --> 00:24:19,700
I mean, he stomps a dragon.

393
00:24:20,580 --> 00:24:23,700
But on accident, that's all leading up to him being an introvert.

394
00:24:23,700 --> 00:24:25,060
He just wants to be left alone.

395
00:24:25,060 --> 00:24:27,780
And everyone else is forcing social interaction upon him.

396
00:24:27,780 --> 00:24:29,220
And we're supposed to side with them.

397
00:24:30,020 --> 00:24:31,860
You want to just recap all the Shrek movies?

398
00:24:31,860 --> 00:24:35,620
I'm just saying that maybe Shrek just wants to be left alone and that's okay.

399
00:24:35,620 --> 00:24:37,300
Do Shrek Forever After next.

400
00:24:40,980 --> 00:24:41,860
Don't you applaud.

401
00:24:41,860 --> 00:24:44,820
If Shrek is left alone, there's no films for us to enjoy.

402
00:24:45,940 --> 00:24:47,380
You know it and I know it, okay?

403
00:24:47,380 --> 00:24:48,900
I'm sorry Shrek was made uncomfortable.

404
00:24:48,900 --> 00:24:52,900
But in the end, pushing past Shrek's boundaries is very healthy for anyone.

405
00:24:52,900 --> 00:24:54,580
Healthy for the movie industry.

406
00:24:54,580 --> 00:24:56,660
Healthy for Jeffrey Katzenberg's bottom line.

407
00:24:57,780 --> 00:24:58,740
Here's what you do.

408
00:24:58,740 --> 00:25:03,060
You bring your mom into a parlor room and you sit her down and say,

409
00:25:03,620 --> 00:25:07,380
Mother, the great game is finally ended.

410
00:25:08,340 --> 00:25:10,020
As the clock strikes midnight.

411
00:25:10,660 --> 00:25:13,780
And now the 10 year statue of limitations has passed.

412
00:25:15,060 --> 00:25:18,500
I can reveal to you my most perfect crime.

413
00:25:18,500 --> 00:25:19,220
It is a-

414
00:25:19,220 --> 00:25:20,500
My beloved toy.

415
00:25:20,500 --> 00:25:23,060
You remember my most beloved toy, Shrump?

416
00:25:23,060 --> 00:25:26,020
Well, if you remove his mustache.

417
00:25:26,020 --> 00:25:29,620
I did not, I did not.

418
00:25:30,980 --> 00:25:35,380
It is the, it is the green ogre, Shrek.

419
00:25:36,420 --> 00:25:40,900
I did not fashion him together for my straps of burlap and calico as I once promised.

420
00:25:40,900 --> 00:25:44,580
No, it was manufactured and I stole him fair and square, Mother.

421
00:25:45,140 --> 00:25:48,260
While I distracted you with my first crime at the Cracker Barrel,

422
00:25:49,300 --> 00:25:51,700
you paid no attention to the actual heist.

423
00:25:51,700 --> 00:25:55,460
And that is how I got revenge on the man who ruined my father.

424
00:25:55,460 --> 00:25:56,100
Hey.

425
00:25:56,100 --> 00:25:57,220
Ruined my father?

426
00:25:57,220 --> 00:25:57,700
Yeah.

427
00:25:57,700 --> 00:25:58,900
Was it a Cracker Barrel?

428
00:25:58,900 --> 00:26:01,140
Because that seems like the only restaurant where you steal toys.

429
00:26:03,540 --> 00:26:04,180
Wait.

430
00:26:04,180 --> 00:26:05,460
Oh, you actually want to answer.

431
00:26:05,460 --> 00:26:06,500
I'm just, I'm curious.

432
00:26:07,940 --> 00:26:08,980
Now Liam is left.

433
00:26:08,980 --> 00:26:10,260
Liam was so embarrassed.

434
00:26:10,260 --> 00:26:10,740
Wait a minute.

435
00:26:10,740 --> 00:26:11,860
Now he's being chased by the cops!

436
00:26:11,860 --> 00:26:12,820
Where's my fucking wallet?

437
00:26:17,060 --> 00:26:21,460
I mean, here's, here's, uh, I still have a lot of questions.

438
00:26:21,460 --> 00:26:23,540
I feel like 10 years is a good amount of time.

439
00:26:23,540 --> 00:26:31,300
I also feel like once you are post 30, you can casually bring up like a time you got

440
00:26:31,300 --> 00:26:36,500
so high at the University of Michigan campus that you slept under a tree in your gym shorts

441
00:26:36,500 --> 00:26:37,620
in front of your dad.

442
00:26:37,620 --> 00:26:41,300
And it's like, I'm an adult man.

443
00:26:41,300 --> 00:26:42,820
I'm an adult and it happened.

444
00:26:42,820 --> 00:26:44,660
Yeah, but you didn't, you weren't there.

445
00:26:44,660 --> 00:26:46,100
You did not catch me.

446
00:26:46,100 --> 00:26:46,740
Griffin White.

447
00:26:46,740 --> 00:26:48,420
Double jeopardy, baby.

448
00:26:48,420 --> 00:26:49,940
What are you implying there?

449
00:26:49,940 --> 00:26:52,740
Because Liam has told us this happened 10 years ago.

450
00:26:52,740 --> 00:26:58,020
And so what you're saying is at age 20, Liam stole a Shrek toy from a restaurant.

451
00:27:02,980 --> 00:27:04,020
I just had to have it.

452
00:27:05,860 --> 00:27:09,460
Liam, if you still have the toy, you know what you have to do.

453
00:27:10,900 --> 00:27:15,860
You have to go back to the restaurant and fall in love with the owner's child.

454
00:27:15,860 --> 00:27:19,700
What? It's a cute story on Reddit.

455
00:27:19,700 --> 00:27:21,540
Okay, I guess.

456
00:27:22,980 --> 00:27:24,340
Travis ruined my train of thought.

457
00:27:24,340 --> 00:27:25,220
Nevermind, Liam.

458
00:27:25,940 --> 00:27:28,020
Just throw it in the garbage and move on with your life.

459
00:27:30,420 --> 00:27:34,260
I will say the good news, Liam, if you have reached adulthood and the worst thing you've

460
00:27:34,260 --> 00:27:40,340
done so far in your life is take a Shrek toy from a restaurant, you're doing okay.

461
00:27:40,340 --> 00:27:45,140
After stealing a Lightning McQueen, I feel like two steals in one trip is kind of up there.

462
00:27:45,140 --> 00:27:46,580
It only counts as one steal.

463
00:27:49,620 --> 00:27:52,260
They stole a toy from a restaurant.

464
00:27:52,260 --> 00:27:56,900
Hey, Liam, if you walk into a restaurant and you're like, hey, what's up?

465
00:27:56,900 --> 00:27:57,620
I'm a thief.

466
00:27:58,580 --> 00:28:00,100
Sorry, my mom's busted me.

467
00:28:00,100 --> 00:28:02,900
You didn't, but here's your Lightning McQueen back.

468
00:28:02,900 --> 00:28:08,260
If they're not watching you like a fucking hawk after that, like, hey, watch that little

469
00:28:08,260 --> 00:28:12,900
idiot clear the front door because I do not trust his sticky fingers.

470
00:28:12,900 --> 00:28:14,100
That's on them.

471
00:28:14,100 --> 00:28:15,780
They basically gave it to you.

472
00:28:15,780 --> 00:28:19,460
Yeah, maybe they were actually super excited you took the Shrek.

473
00:28:19,460 --> 00:28:21,860
They're like, we've been trying to get rid of that Shrek forever.

474
00:28:21,860 --> 00:28:25,060
We have that sweet honey pot just waiting for someone to steal it.

475
00:28:25,060 --> 00:28:25,540
Thank you.

476
00:28:26,100 --> 00:28:27,700
We hate that green ogre.

477
00:28:30,580 --> 00:28:31,380
For insurance.

478
00:28:31,380 --> 00:28:32,820
Somebody said for insurance.

479
00:28:33,780 --> 00:28:37,220
They insured that Shrek doll for millions of dollars.

480
00:28:37,220 --> 00:28:44,260
Finally, someone fell for it.

481
00:28:45,220 --> 00:28:48,260
This one was hand kissed by Mike Myers.

482
00:28:51,380 --> 00:28:53,540
I have a Yahoo here that was sent in by Max.

483
00:28:53,540 --> 00:28:54,660
Thank you, Max.

484
00:28:54,660 --> 00:28:57,700
It's an anonymous Yahoo Answers user who I'm going to call.

485
00:28:57,700 --> 00:29:05,940
Paul asks,

486
00:29:11,060 --> 00:29:14,180
Paul, would you want a hallway full of vending machines?

487
00:29:14,900 --> 00:29:18,500
So when guests come over, you can make yourself a nice little profit.

488
00:29:18,500 --> 00:29:27,860
Let's just go straight down the line.

489
00:29:27,860 --> 00:29:28,740
No discussion yet.

490
00:29:28,740 --> 00:29:29,940
Paul, yes or no?

491
00:29:29,940 --> 00:29:31,380
Would I do it?

492
00:29:31,380 --> 00:29:32,740
Would you want it?

493
00:29:32,740 --> 00:29:33,940
Paul, yes or no?

494
00:29:33,940 --> 00:29:36,100
As a guest or as a homeowner?

495
00:29:36,100 --> 00:29:36,980
As a homeowner.

496
00:29:39,780 --> 00:29:40,100
Yeah.

497
00:29:40,660 --> 00:29:41,140
Yes.

498
00:29:41,140 --> 00:29:42,020
Yeah, okay.

499
00:29:43,060 --> 00:29:44,180
I think so.

500
00:29:44,180 --> 00:29:45,140
Here's my argument.

501
00:29:45,140 --> 00:29:51,940
I'm, as Travis has so cavalierly thrown out, can be uncomfortable in some situations,

502
00:29:51,940 --> 00:29:52,900
socially speaking.

503
00:29:54,500 --> 00:29:58,580
If I didn't have to ask somebody for a Diet Coke and I just had to go put fucking a dollar

504
00:29:58,580 --> 00:30:00,340
in the machine, I'd be stoked as hell.

505
00:30:01,300 --> 00:30:02,980
I don't have to ask people for anything.

506
00:30:02,980 --> 00:30:04,820
I can just buy my own Kit Kat.

507
00:30:04,820 --> 00:30:05,940
Fuck yes, I would.

508
00:30:05,940 --> 00:30:06,740
Absolutely.

509
00:30:06,740 --> 00:30:08,020
That's a great host.

510
00:30:08,020 --> 00:30:10,500
They've cut down one uncomfortable interaction.

511
00:30:10,500 --> 00:30:14,340
If there was like a place I could pay to pee, that would be great.

512
00:30:14,340 --> 00:30:14,900
Pee?

513
00:30:14,900 --> 00:30:16,420
That would be ideal for me.

514
00:30:16,420 --> 00:30:16,900
I just-

515
00:30:17,540 --> 00:30:19,220
Because then you feel like you belong there.

516
00:30:19,220 --> 00:30:20,740
I'm supposed to eat this.

517
00:30:20,740 --> 00:30:21,540
I own it.

518
00:30:21,540 --> 00:30:22,100
I own this.

519
00:30:22,100 --> 00:30:23,140
I bought this from you.

520
00:30:23,140 --> 00:30:28,260
This is unprecedented because I've just thought of a way to answer an actual question

521
00:30:28,260 --> 00:30:29,540
with a Yahoo answer.

522
00:30:30,100 --> 00:30:35,700
It's a sort of synthesis we've never done before, but you could put little index cards

523
00:30:35,700 --> 00:30:45,620
in the little spirals that say good for one massage.

524
00:30:45,620 --> 00:30:46,340
Okay.

525
00:30:47,780 --> 00:30:48,340
Okay.

526
00:30:49,860 --> 00:30:50,420
Huh.

527
00:30:50,420 --> 00:30:51,700
Ouroboros.

528
00:30:51,700 --> 00:30:52,820
The snake eats its tail.

529
00:30:52,820 --> 00:30:54,980
Nope, it's a straightforward snake.

530
00:30:54,980 --> 00:30:55,860
It's just a snake.

531
00:30:55,860 --> 00:30:57,220
But I mean what you did just right there.

532
00:30:57,220 --> 00:30:59,060
A snake eats another snake.

533
00:30:59,060 --> 00:30:59,560
Yes.

534
00:31:01,220 --> 00:31:02,420
That could be good.

535
00:31:02,420 --> 00:31:03,460
Oh man.

536
00:31:03,460 --> 00:31:05,220
It depends on what kind of vending machines.

537
00:31:05,220 --> 00:31:05,940
Yes.

538
00:31:05,940 --> 00:31:09,940
We had one vending machine at the high school I went to, Huntington High.

539
00:31:09,940 --> 00:31:10,900
Go Highlanders.

540
00:31:10,900 --> 00:31:15,060
I guess I was never very enthusiastic about your sports when I was there, so I don't know

541
00:31:15,060 --> 00:31:17,460
why I would like 16 years removed.

542
00:31:17,460 --> 00:31:26,340
But anyway, we had a Fruitopia vending machine way past Fruitopia's tragic death.

543
00:31:28,100 --> 00:31:29,540
Where were they getting it?

544
00:31:29,540 --> 00:31:29,940
What?

545
00:31:29,940 --> 00:31:30,660
Where were they getting it?

546
00:31:30,660 --> 00:31:31,620
That's a good question.

547
00:31:31,620 --> 00:31:32,820
It was all the same ones, just leftover.

548
00:31:32,820 --> 00:31:35,460
It may have just been the same Fruitopia.

549
00:31:35,460 --> 00:31:39,300
If memory serves, it was all sold out except for one flavor, and that flavor must have

550
00:31:39,300 --> 00:31:40,660
been fucking bad.

551
00:31:42,260 --> 00:31:47,220
At my middle school, they had a vending machine that only sold cans of guava juice,

552
00:31:48,820 --> 00:31:52,100
which sounds bougie, but they all look like they were made in 1970s.

553
00:31:52,100 --> 00:31:52,340
Yeah.

554
00:31:53,060 --> 00:31:58,420
But if you get one of those vending machines that have like lifesavers up top and Pop-Tarts

555
00:31:58,420 --> 00:32:02,660
at the bottom for some reason, that's the only two things I need.

556
00:32:02,660 --> 00:32:06,740
But that's terrifying when the lifesavers are on top because you know it's dust by

557
00:32:06,740 --> 00:32:08,020
the time it gets to the bottom.

558
00:32:08,980 --> 00:32:13,620
That is a long fall for lifesavers to make and like survive.

559
00:32:13,620 --> 00:32:14,580
Let me hit you with this.

560
00:32:15,140 --> 00:32:17,860
Giant vending machine, nothing but condoms.

561
00:32:17,860 --> 00:32:19,700
What is being messaged there?

562
00:32:19,700 --> 00:32:20,820
That's my question to you.

563
00:32:20,820 --> 00:32:22,740
Why does it have to be giant?

564
00:32:24,260 --> 00:32:27,460
How many varietals are included here?

565
00:32:27,460 --> 00:32:32,580
Because Travis, a small vending machine full of condoms isn't very funny.

566
00:32:32,580 --> 00:32:39,620
I would actually argue that one condom-sized vending machine with one row of condoms.

567
00:32:40,740 --> 00:32:44,020
Or just one condom in it and it costs $500.

568
00:32:46,340 --> 00:32:49,940
I feel like if you have a one condom vending machine, that's being judgmental.

569
00:32:49,940 --> 00:32:51,940
That's like putting it behind a paywall.

570
00:32:51,940 --> 00:32:53,860
You should just be giving those things away.

571
00:32:53,860 --> 00:32:59,860
But if you expand the size to a lot, then it starts to seem like you're an enthusiast

572
00:32:59,860 --> 00:33:01,380
and you just want to offer variety.

573
00:33:01,380 --> 00:33:02,660
Let me throw this out.

574
00:33:02,660 --> 00:33:05,460
500 spots, all sold out except one.

575
00:33:06,900 --> 00:33:08,260
I had a big night last night.

576
00:33:08,260 --> 00:33:09,460
I don't want to talk about it.

577
00:33:11,140 --> 00:33:15,140
I tried to make my house liken up, but it didn't work.

578
00:33:15,140 --> 00:33:24,980
I imagine in that movie,

579
00:33:24,980 --> 00:33:29,380
the old man is just floating by other people's houses with his condom balloons,

580
00:33:29,380 --> 00:33:32,260
just like looking in the windows and like flirting.

581
00:33:32,260 --> 00:33:46,100
And that movie is called You Up.

582
00:33:50,100 --> 00:33:53,860
Someone on Twitter is going to steal that joke and get a million followers.

583
00:33:55,140 --> 00:33:57,300
I don't think that would fit in the tweet, mon frere.

584
00:33:57,300 --> 00:33:59,140
That's a long way around to get to that one.

585
00:33:59,140 --> 00:34:02,740
So now imagine there's a hallway lined with vending machines, right?

586
00:34:03,300 --> 00:34:08,260
So giant vending machine, full of condoms, price for each item, one massage, but

587
00:34:11,380 --> 00:34:12,100
received.

588
00:34:14,100 --> 00:34:15,380
You let me give you a massage.

589
00:34:15,380 --> 00:34:16,180
I give you a condom.

590
00:34:16,180 --> 00:34:16,980
This is bad.

591
00:34:16,980 --> 00:34:18,020
This is actually gone.

592
00:34:18,740 --> 00:34:20,020
Don't do this one.

593
00:34:20,020 --> 00:34:21,620
This one is not a good one.

594
00:34:21,620 --> 00:34:22,500
You know what I'm saying?

595
00:34:22,500 --> 00:34:23,220
And I'm hearing it.

596
00:34:23,220 --> 00:34:24,100
I'm hearing it.

597
00:34:24,100 --> 00:34:25,140
Yeah, absolutely.

598
00:34:25,140 --> 00:34:26,100
It's bad.

599
00:34:26,100 --> 00:34:27,300
Absolutely.

600
00:34:27,300 --> 00:34:28,260
This one's not good.

601
00:34:28,260 --> 00:34:29,060
Don't do that one.

602
00:34:29,060 --> 00:34:37,300
But you do you watch your guests walk through this hallway, judging their choices

603
00:34:38,180 --> 00:34:38,820
as they walk?

604
00:34:38,820 --> 00:34:41,300
Because I imagine a hallway full of vending machines.

605
00:34:41,300 --> 00:34:46,900
I'm imagining some like the shining but with product placement sort of action going on.

606
00:34:46,900 --> 00:34:47,300
Right.

607
00:34:47,300 --> 00:34:50,900
And so they walk past the, you know, the sprite machine.

608
00:34:50,900 --> 00:34:54,100
They walk past the one with the lifesavers and pop tarts.

609
00:34:54,100 --> 00:34:57,140
They walk past one that has like your mixtape in it.

610
00:34:57,140 --> 00:35:00,100
And you're like, oh, you're going to stuff with the mixtape one?

611
00:35:00,820 --> 00:35:01,460
I made that.

612
00:35:01,460 --> 00:35:03,380
These are some hand-drawn zines.

613
00:35:03,380 --> 00:35:05,060
No, I'm going to keep on going.

614
00:35:05,060 --> 00:35:06,500
You're not going to buy my zines.

615
00:35:06,500 --> 00:35:06,820
Okay.

616
00:35:07,780 --> 00:35:10,260
Can you do a question for me, Justin?

617
00:35:10,260 --> 00:35:11,140
I love that, Griffin.

618
00:35:11,140 --> 00:35:12,260
Thank you so much for asking.

619
00:35:12,260 --> 00:35:13,140
That's so sweet of you.

620
00:35:14,580 --> 00:35:18,100
I'm 24 and I want to get into eating cheese.

621
00:35:18,100 --> 00:35:20,580
It felt like he was going to interrupt us, which is why I...

622
00:35:21,140 --> 00:35:21,860
No.

623
00:35:21,860 --> 00:35:25,460
It felt like he was going to interrupt himself, but I was really excited to watch it happen.

624
00:35:25,460 --> 00:35:25,940
Yeah.

625
00:35:25,940 --> 00:35:30,660
So I'm 24 and I want to get into eating cheese so that I don't feel like a social pariah at

626
00:35:30,660 --> 00:35:31,700
fancy dinner parties.

627
00:35:33,620 --> 00:35:35,140
Did you just lean over to fart?

628
00:35:35,780 --> 00:35:36,820
No, he was scared you were going to interrupt yourself.

629
00:35:36,820 --> 00:35:39,220
I'm afraid you're going to like yell at me.

630
00:35:39,220 --> 00:35:42,900
So I don't feel like a social pariah at fancy dinner parties.

631
00:35:42,900 --> 00:35:44,660
I'm not lactose intolerant.

632
00:35:44,660 --> 00:35:46,740
I just don't like how it tastes.

633
00:35:46,740 --> 00:35:46,980
Yes.

634
00:35:48,020 --> 00:35:50,660
I do love pizza, though, because pizza is the perfect food.

635
00:35:50,660 --> 00:35:52,260
Second, only the sandwiches.

636
00:35:52,260 --> 00:35:53,700
That's incorrect, but whatever.

637
00:35:53,700 --> 00:35:57,060
I assume that, at least for me, it will be an acquired taste.

638
00:35:57,540 --> 00:36:00,340
What would be a good type of cheese to start with?

639
00:36:00,340 --> 00:36:01,940
And that's from Cheeseless in the district.

640
00:36:01,940 --> 00:36:05,940
Now, brothers, I am going to have to defer to you on this question.

641
00:36:05,940 --> 00:36:11,140
I'm assuming the first dozen pieces of raw cheese you put in your mouths were foul and

642
00:36:11,140 --> 00:36:13,220
profane as they would...

643
00:36:13,220 --> 00:36:15,780
Please explain the terminology you've just used.

644
00:36:16,500 --> 00:36:16,980
Raw cheese.

645
00:36:16,980 --> 00:36:18,020
We've talked about it before.

646
00:36:18,020 --> 00:36:20,100
I don't fuck with raw cheese.

647
00:36:20,100 --> 00:36:23,140
I only like melted cheese, like on pizza or burgers.

648
00:36:23,140 --> 00:36:25,460
I just don't fuck with raw cheese.

649
00:36:25,460 --> 00:36:26,420
It's so good.

650
00:36:26,420 --> 00:36:26,980
It's not that weird.

651
00:36:26,980 --> 00:36:28,900
Raw cheese is milk.

652
00:36:28,900 --> 00:36:30,260
I just don't fuck with raw cheese.

653
00:36:32,820 --> 00:36:34,420
So you guys will have to talk about how...

654
00:36:36,420 --> 00:36:38,900
Don't do this to me right now, okay?

655
00:36:38,900 --> 00:36:39,780
Trying to do a comedy show.

656
00:36:39,780 --> 00:36:41,700
I don't want to talk about raw cheese and how...

657
00:36:41,700 --> 00:36:44,580
Cheese has been cooked, kind of.

658
00:36:44,580 --> 00:36:45,060
My wife...

659
00:36:45,620 --> 00:36:48,100
It's been stirred enough, I think.

660
00:36:48,100 --> 00:36:51,460
We've been trying to get the kids to broaden their palates, and Sidney said,

661
00:36:51,460 --> 00:36:56,020
you know, you set a really bad example because you rule out whole categories of foods that

662
00:36:56,020 --> 00:36:57,300
you won't even try.

663
00:36:57,300 --> 00:36:58,340
I said, name one.

664
00:36:58,340 --> 00:36:59,380
She said, raw cheese.

665
00:36:59,380 --> 00:37:00,100
I said, name two.

666
00:37:00,100 --> 00:37:01,300
That was a gimme.

667
00:37:01,300 --> 00:37:03,860
And she said, creamy dips.

668
00:37:05,220 --> 00:37:07,140
And it's fair.

669
00:37:07,140 --> 00:37:08,500
I won't eat creamy dips.

670
00:37:08,500 --> 00:37:11,220
And she said, you can't just say you won't eat creamy dips.

671
00:37:11,220 --> 00:37:12,420
You're 38 years old.

672
00:37:13,940 --> 00:37:16,020
I said, let me turn that around on you.

673
00:37:16,020 --> 00:37:17,380
I'm 38 years old.

674
00:37:17,380 --> 00:37:20,020
I can say that I don't like creamy dips.

675
00:37:20,020 --> 00:37:21,380
I'm just not going to do that.

676
00:37:22,180 --> 00:37:25,220
French onion, the soup's great, the dip's whack.

677
00:37:25,780 --> 00:37:27,940
Creamy ranch, ranch, foul.

678
00:37:27,940 --> 00:37:30,100
That's the one that boggles my mind.

679
00:37:30,100 --> 00:37:32,660
Ranch, the second...

680
00:37:32,660 --> 00:37:36,260
I would say it goes like ketchup and mustard tied ranch.

681
00:37:36,260 --> 00:37:38,900
It's like right there of most go-to...

682
00:37:38,900 --> 00:37:40,020
Don't fuck with it.

683
00:37:40,020 --> 00:37:43,220
Don't fuck with ranch, don't fuck with creamy dips, don't fuck with raw cheese.

684
00:37:43,220 --> 00:37:44,740
So, brothers, how did you start?

685
00:37:44,740 --> 00:37:49,140
How did you power through your first 100 nasty bites of raw cheese?

686
00:37:49,140 --> 00:37:52,260
Raw cheese to trick yourself into thinking it was good.

687
00:37:52,260 --> 00:37:54,180
I'll get to how to enjoy it in a second.

688
00:37:54,180 --> 00:38:00,580
If you want to sound continental, more than any other like food there is,

689
00:38:01,220 --> 00:38:06,100
cheese is the easiest thing to bullshit about and sound intelligence

690
00:38:06,100 --> 00:38:12,260
to the point where you can even comment on the consistency of it

691
00:38:12,260 --> 00:38:14,820
and sound smart and go, oh, that's a soft cheese.

692
00:38:16,500 --> 00:38:18,340
A thing anyone could tell.

693
00:38:18,340 --> 00:38:22,180
I mean, like, oh, yes, oh, that's kind of a hard cheese.

694
00:38:22,180 --> 00:38:26,020
I kind of destroyed that with my teeth into a different state

695
00:38:26,020 --> 00:38:27,940
that was easier to swallow, so...

696
00:38:29,140 --> 00:38:31,540
I have a few ketchels that I use for wine

697
00:38:31,540 --> 00:38:32,660
that you could probably steal for cheese.

698
00:38:32,660 --> 00:38:33,220
Okay.

699
00:38:33,220 --> 00:38:34,100
Let me give you one.

700
00:38:36,660 --> 00:38:37,780
Oh, assertive.

701
00:38:37,780 --> 00:38:38,280
Oh!

702
00:38:42,580 --> 00:38:44,980
And then you back it up again, like take another sip

703
00:38:44,980 --> 00:38:47,060
and buy yourself a little bit more time.

704
00:38:47,060 --> 00:38:48,420
That's assertive fruit.

705
00:38:48,420 --> 00:38:50,020
That's an assertive fruit on there.

706
00:38:50,020 --> 00:38:52,980
Oh, is that pepper?

707
00:38:52,980 --> 00:38:53,620
Oh!

708
00:38:53,620 --> 00:38:54,580
I love it to that.

709
00:38:54,580 --> 00:38:54,980
That's good.

710
00:38:54,980 --> 00:38:55,700
Can I try one?

711
00:38:55,700 --> 00:38:56,180
Yeah.

712
00:38:56,180 --> 00:38:58,820
Take a bite of the cheese and go, oh, that's very cheese forward.

713
00:39:00,580 --> 00:39:03,460
That sounds like you're doing a sketch.

714
00:39:03,460 --> 00:39:04,420
I wouldn't do that.

715
00:39:04,900 --> 00:39:06,340
You could also take a bite.

716
00:39:06,340 --> 00:39:07,540
Here's the secret.

717
00:39:07,540 --> 00:39:09,940
Unlike wine, actually exactly like wine,

718
00:39:09,940 --> 00:39:12,740
nobody has any fucking idea what they're talking about.

719
00:39:12,740 --> 00:39:18,180
So, if you pick up any cheese and bite it and go,

720
00:39:18,180 --> 00:39:22,180
oh, that's gone bad, nobody can disprove it.

721
00:39:22,180 --> 00:39:24,980
Start it with, actually, that's bad.

722
00:39:25,860 --> 00:39:27,060
Oh, don't eat this one, guys.

723
00:39:27,940 --> 00:39:29,060
This one's bad.

724
00:39:29,060 --> 00:39:30,020
Don't eat this one, Mary.

725
00:39:30,020 --> 00:39:33,300
That would go well with crackers is another like,

726
00:39:33,300 --> 00:39:35,780
95% of the time, you're cool with that.

727
00:39:35,780 --> 00:39:37,860
I like how you guys have glommed onto the easy part

728
00:39:37,860 --> 00:39:39,460
of this question, which is faking expertise,

729
00:39:39,460 --> 00:39:40,980
which anyone could do at any time.

730
00:39:40,980 --> 00:39:45,300
And not focus on the hard part, which is how to eat fucking rowdy cheese.

731
00:39:45,300 --> 00:39:46,260
What am I supposed to do?

732
00:39:46,260 --> 00:39:47,220
I'm not going to teach them.

733
00:39:47,220 --> 00:39:48,100
I'll tell you how to do it.

734
00:39:48,100 --> 00:39:50,500
Yeah, I'm not going to do close-up magic for you up here

735
00:39:50,500 --> 00:39:51,620
to show you how to pocket it.

736
00:39:51,620 --> 00:39:52,900
I want you to take a bite of the cheese.

737
00:39:52,900 --> 00:39:54,580
This is what I do when I go to the dentist.

738
00:39:54,580 --> 00:39:56,420
Take a bite of the cheese, and then just start counting.

739
00:39:56,420 --> 00:39:58,180
What the fuck's up with your dentist, my bud?

740
00:39:59,140 --> 00:40:00,660
No, no, no, let me get to it.

741
00:40:01,220 --> 00:40:02,100
Take a bite of the cheese.

742
00:40:02,100 --> 00:40:04,740
Your teeth are fucked up, and we're going to have to get in there

743
00:40:04,740 --> 00:40:07,460
like Rambo and save your mouth.

744
00:40:07,460 --> 00:40:11,540
But first, I melted some Brie on some apples.

745
00:40:14,580 --> 00:40:16,420
That wasn't the part I was getting.

746
00:40:16,420 --> 00:40:17,540
That would be nice.

747
00:40:17,540 --> 00:40:18,100
I wouldn't.

748
00:40:18,100 --> 00:40:21,060
Now that you're saying that, that would be pretty cool.

749
00:40:21,060 --> 00:40:22,420
I mean, if they melt it, sure.

750
00:40:24,420 --> 00:40:24,980
That's fine, too.

751
00:40:24,980 --> 00:40:25,780
We're all in agreement.

752
00:40:25,780 --> 00:40:28,820
Take a bite of the cheese, and then start counting ceiling tiles.

753
00:40:28,820 --> 00:40:30,900
That's what I was going to say.

754
00:40:30,900 --> 00:40:31,860
Oh, that was it?

755
00:40:31,860 --> 00:40:32,340
Yes.

756
00:40:32,340 --> 00:40:33,060
Wow.

757
00:40:33,060 --> 00:40:34,580
That's what I do at the dentist.

758
00:40:34,580 --> 00:40:35,860
It wasn't a good bit.

759
00:40:35,860 --> 00:40:39,300
But I was hoping I'd give you time to think of something funny to say.

760
00:40:41,300 --> 00:40:43,140
Now, we've pulled back the curtain too far.

761
00:40:43,140 --> 00:40:43,620
Oh, shit.

762
00:40:43,620 --> 00:40:44,660
Duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh.

763
00:40:44,660 --> 00:40:46,660
Duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh.

764
00:40:49,860 --> 00:40:51,220
Something in the monitor.

765
00:40:51,220 --> 00:40:52,340
I had something in the monitor.

766
00:40:52,340 --> 00:40:53,060
Probably it's in the monitor.

767
00:40:53,060 --> 00:40:54,020
Dun-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh.

768
00:40:56,020 --> 00:40:56,980
That's not going to cut it.

769
00:40:57,860 --> 00:40:58,900
Not for DC.

770
00:40:58,900 --> 00:40:59,860
Speed back or something.

771
00:40:59,860 --> 00:41:00,500
Yeah, pump it up.

772
00:41:00,500 --> 00:41:01,220
Here we go.

773
00:41:01,220 --> 00:41:02,740
Dun-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh.

774
00:41:02,740 --> 00:41:04,260
I want a munch.

775
00:41:04,260 --> 00:41:07,940
I want a munch, squad.

776
00:41:07,940 --> 00:41:15,780
I want to munch, squad.

777
00:41:15,780 --> 00:41:16,980
Welcome to Munch Squad.

778
00:41:16,980 --> 00:41:21,380
It's a podcast within a podcast.

779
00:41:23,060 --> 00:41:25,300
Thank you to Jade for that theme song.

780
00:41:25,300 --> 00:41:30,340
This is a podcast of the podcast highlighting the latest and greatest in brand eating

781
00:41:30,340 --> 00:41:34,340
and quick service restaurant innovation.

782
00:41:34,340 --> 00:41:35,940
Fun-ovation, if you will.

783
00:41:35,940 --> 00:41:36,740
I will.

784
00:41:36,740 --> 00:41:38,900
I have fucking huge news.

785
00:41:42,900 --> 00:41:51,300
Does everybody feel kind of bummed out by how static the level of craveable innovation has been?

786
00:41:54,260 --> 00:41:54,900
Fear not.

787
00:41:56,740 --> 00:42:00,020
If you listen to this show and the answer to that is yes,

788
00:42:00,020 --> 00:42:01,060
you're a madman.

789
00:42:03,700 --> 00:42:06,660
Taco Bell has taken craveable innovation to the next level.

790
00:42:06,660 --> 00:42:08,100
I didn't want it to be them.

791
00:42:08,100 --> 00:42:09,300
It was, though.

792
00:42:09,300 --> 00:42:10,500
Who else would it be?

793
00:42:11,060 --> 00:42:16,340
They're delisting the fucking cooler ranch Locos Doritos taco.

794
00:42:16,340 --> 00:42:18,580
They can fuck off if they're replacing it with-

795
00:42:18,580 --> 00:42:19,780
No, no, no, listen.

796
00:42:19,780 --> 00:42:23,140
Unless it's two Locos Doritos cooler ranch tacos.

797
00:42:24,260 --> 00:42:26,020
Here's the subhead for this.

798
00:42:26,660 --> 00:42:29,780
The company gives fans carefree indulgence.

799
00:42:29,780 --> 00:42:31,940
In this elevated chalupa experience.

800
00:42:31,940 --> 00:42:33,060
Come my friends.

801
00:42:33,940 --> 00:42:38,340
This is a very accurate subhead because if you eat the toasted cheddar chalupa

802
00:42:38,340 --> 00:42:40,180
and someone's like, what are you doing?

803
00:42:40,180 --> 00:42:42,340
Your proper response is, I don't fucking care.

804
00:42:42,340 --> 00:42:42,840
Yes.

805
00:42:44,500 --> 00:42:46,020
I'm literally carefree.

806
00:42:46,900 --> 00:42:49,460
Not about my body, not about my spirit.

807
00:42:49,460 --> 00:42:52,340
I've never thought about carefree in those terms before.

808
00:42:52,900 --> 00:42:55,540
I used to care and now I've given up.

809
00:42:55,540 --> 00:42:56,980
Yeah, I'm free of caring.

810
00:42:56,980 --> 00:43:01,540
That is also the most hedonistic subhead I've ever heard a company put its name.

811
00:43:01,540 --> 00:43:03,540
Indulge in our pleasure.

812
00:43:03,540 --> 00:43:06,740
Eat the cheese and the beef we have supplied.

813
00:43:06,740 --> 00:43:08,420
Live in the moment.

814
00:43:08,420 --> 00:43:11,700
You guys are having a lot of fun with the fucking subhead of this press release.

815
00:43:12,660 --> 00:43:18,980
The beloved Taco Bell chalupa that fans know and love is getting a next level cheesy glow up.

816
00:43:20,500 --> 00:43:23,700
Introducing the toasted cheddar chalupa.

817
00:43:23,700 --> 00:43:29,860
Confirmed for nationwide release September 12th.

818
00:43:29,860 --> 00:43:31,060
Holy shit.

819
00:43:31,060 --> 00:43:31,700
Come on.

820
00:43:31,700 --> 00:43:33,300
We checked with our scientists.

821
00:43:33,300 --> 00:43:34,820
We just checked with ourselves.

822
00:43:34,820 --> 00:43:36,420
We are definitely doing this, folks.

823
00:43:37,380 --> 00:43:37,860
I like that.

824
00:43:37,860 --> 00:43:38,740
That sounds like a threat.

825
00:43:38,740 --> 00:43:39,940
You can't reason with us.

826
00:43:39,940 --> 00:43:40,900
We've confirmed it.

827
00:43:41,460 --> 00:43:44,020
We're way past the point of no return on this one.

828
00:43:44,020 --> 00:43:45,780
Historically, also they tested in one market.

829
00:43:45,780 --> 00:43:51,700
So it's like, well, we killed Buffalo, but at least we didn't get the rest of the country.

830
00:43:51,700 --> 00:43:56,500
The toasted cheddar chalupa presents brilliantly simplistic shell innovation

831
00:43:57,140 --> 00:44:01,780
by baking real aged cheddar cheese onto the shell.

832
00:44:02,340 --> 00:44:05,060
Since the classic chalupa was first introduced in 1999,

833
00:44:05,060 --> 00:44:08,420
Taco Bell has consistently found new ways to create all new chalupa experiences.

834
00:44:08,420 --> 00:44:08,900
Thank God.

835
00:44:09,460 --> 00:44:12,740
Whether it's flavor innovation like the Baja chalupa in 2000,

836
00:44:12,740 --> 00:44:16,100
size innovation with the 2017 launch of the double chalupa.

837
00:44:16,820 --> 00:44:19,620
Is that an innovation, Taco Bell?

838
00:44:19,620 --> 00:44:23,940
That is just, that is just addition.

839
00:44:23,940 --> 00:44:26,900
Or protein innovation with the naked chicken chalupa.

840
00:44:28,740 --> 00:44:34,100
That is, that is not a protein innovation.

841
00:44:34,100 --> 00:44:37,940
It's a fucking whack chicken breast they folded into a taco.

842
00:44:37,940 --> 00:44:38,820
No, I get that.

843
00:44:38,820 --> 00:44:41,380
But that's not like we've invented a new protein.

844
00:44:41,380 --> 00:44:44,420
Yeah, we found some new protein fossilized in amber.

845
00:44:44,420 --> 00:44:46,100
Naked chicken chalupa that same year.

846
00:44:46,660 --> 00:44:49,060
The chalupa experience has no boundaries.

847
00:44:49,060 --> 00:44:49,940
And that is a threat.

848
00:44:50,580 --> 00:44:51,620
That is a threat.

849
00:44:51,620 --> 00:44:53,220
We are not stopping here, folks.

850
00:44:53,220 --> 00:44:56,180
We are nowhere near the fucking Rubicon.

851
00:44:56,180 --> 00:44:59,060
At Taco Bell, here's a quote from Liz Matthews,

852
00:44:59,060 --> 00:45:01,300
chief food innovation officer at Taco Bell Corp.

853
00:45:01,300 --> 00:45:03,940
At Taco Bell, we get excited by the what ifs.

854
00:45:05,620 --> 00:45:06,820
It gets us rock hard.

855
00:45:06,820 --> 00:45:07,780
It gets us rock hard.

856
00:45:08,580 --> 00:45:12,980
But the what ifs we can dream up and bring to life for our fans.

857
00:45:12,980 --> 00:45:15,860
And it is a living, sentient being.

858
00:45:15,860 --> 00:45:20,020
And the toasted cheddar chalupa is an example of just that.

859
00:45:20,740 --> 00:45:22,580
We know cheese makes everything better.

860
00:45:24,180 --> 00:45:25,060
Within limits.

861
00:45:25,060 --> 00:45:29,060
And baking aged cheddar into the shell of an already iconic product

862
00:45:29,060 --> 00:45:32,100
is a game changer for our fans.

863
00:45:32,100 --> 00:45:32,980
Our fans will love.

864
00:45:32,980 --> 00:45:36,820
I don't know what the game is, but I feel we've all lost already.

865
00:45:37,380 --> 00:45:41,620
To be fair, baking cheese onto most games is a game changer.

866
00:45:41,620 --> 00:45:42,420
Sure.

867
00:45:42,420 --> 00:45:44,180
That's a lot harder to play chess, huh?

868
00:45:44,180 --> 00:45:47,780
Hey, I think your copy of Operation is fucked.

869
00:45:49,380 --> 00:45:50,580
If there's one-

870
00:45:50,580 --> 00:45:51,860
This thing's 10 paragraphs long.

871
00:45:51,860 --> 00:45:52,580
Oh, God!

872
00:45:52,580 --> 00:45:53,620
We gotta haul ass.

873
00:45:53,620 --> 00:45:56,180
If there's one sure sign of the latest foodie craze,

874
00:45:56,180 --> 00:45:58,180
it's a line stretching around the block.

875
00:45:58,180 --> 00:45:58,980
That's why Taco-

876
00:45:59,940 --> 00:46:03,060
That has nothing to do with fucking anything, Taco Bell!

877
00:46:03,620 --> 00:46:06,660
Yeah, it would mean something if people were lining up.

878
00:46:06,660 --> 00:46:07,300
Anyways.

879
00:46:09,060 --> 00:46:10,020
Okay, listen, though.

880
00:46:11,220 --> 00:46:13,620
If there's one sure sign of the line stretching around the block,

881
00:46:13,620 --> 00:46:18,020
that's why Taco Bell is giving a few fans the chance to try Taco Bell's latest

882
00:46:18,020 --> 00:46:21,940
craveable innovation before it's even available nationwide.

883
00:46:21,940 --> 00:46:25,380
But because the foodiest hotspots are all the best kept secrets,

884
00:46:26,020 --> 00:46:31,140
fans will have to uncover where the advanced tastings of toasted cheddar

885
00:46:31,780 --> 00:46:33,300
are being served for themselves.

886
00:46:34,420 --> 00:46:35,140
Are they doing-

887
00:46:35,140 --> 00:46:36,980
They're gonna have to hire Nicolas Cage.

888
00:46:36,980 --> 00:46:45,700
The most wild thing about this paragraph,

889
00:46:46,260 --> 00:46:48,180
and I'm sure there's more wild things about the other paragraphs,

890
00:46:48,180 --> 00:46:49,300
but this paragraph specifically,

891
00:46:49,860 --> 00:46:53,300
is that they are basically saying, like,

892
00:46:53,300 --> 00:46:55,060
wouldn't it be weird if we were, like, real food?

893
00:46:56,820 --> 00:46:58,500
It's basically, like, food face.

894
00:46:58,500 --> 00:47:00,340
Like, they're pretending to be food.

895
00:47:00,340 --> 00:47:04,420
It's a perversion of what we understand food to be like.

896
00:47:04,420 --> 00:47:06,820
What if Taco Bell was, like, food?

897
00:47:06,820 --> 00:47:08,420
That you'd buy at a restaurant?

898
00:47:08,420 --> 00:47:09,300
Wouldn't that be wild?

899
00:47:09,300 --> 00:47:13,300
Also, the weird kayfabe of putting out a press release and saying,

900
00:47:13,300 --> 00:47:14,820
but we're not gonna tell you,

901
00:47:14,820 --> 00:47:18,020
as though they haven't published, like, a dissertation.

902
00:47:18,020 --> 00:47:19,460
They haven't published locations, though.

903
00:47:19,460 --> 00:47:19,940
That's what's secret.

904
00:47:19,940 --> 00:47:24,660
Is this the start of a fucking Taco Bell ARG Justin McElroy?

905
00:47:25,620 --> 00:47:27,380
Not, not, uh...

906
00:47:27,380 --> 00:47:27,700
Is this-

907
00:47:27,700 --> 00:47:29,540
You mean an alternate reality gordita?

908
00:47:29,540 --> 00:47:30,340
No, it is not.

909
00:47:31,460 --> 00:47:32,740
Is it I love cheese?

910
00:47:33,380 --> 00:47:36,340
And see, there is an ARG called I love bees that promoted a halo-

911
00:47:36,340 --> 00:47:37,460
Okay, six of you like that.

912
00:47:39,060 --> 00:47:41,700
The toasted cheddar chalupa is not just one of this year's

913
00:47:41,700 --> 00:47:43,540
biggest innovations from Taco Bell,

914
00:47:43,540 --> 00:47:46,820
it's also the largest international release of a menu item from Taco Bell

915
00:47:46,820 --> 00:47:48,980
since the naked chicken chalupa in 2017.

916
00:47:48,980 --> 00:47:50,740
Starting this month and for a limited time,

917
00:47:50,740 --> 00:47:54,980
the menu item will also be available in Aruba, Canada, Chile, Costa Rica,

918
00:47:54,980 --> 00:47:58,580
Dominican Republic, El Salvador, Guatemala, Panama, and Puerto Rico.

919
00:47:58,580 --> 00:48:00,820
After all, the love of cheese is definitely universal.

920
00:48:01,700 --> 00:48:05,780
Like the classic chalupa, the toasted cheddar chalupa is filled with the option

921
00:48:05,780 --> 00:48:08,980
of seasoned beef, chicken, or steak, and then piled with shredded lettuce.

922
00:48:08,980 --> 00:48:10,420
These are just the ingredients.

923
00:48:10,420 --> 00:48:14,100
What takes the chalupa to foodie-worthy status is all on the outside of the shell.

924
00:48:14,100 --> 00:48:15,460
It's the fucking cheese you melted.

925
00:48:15,460 --> 00:48:18,660
Like yeah, why do these press releases have to tell you six times and then

926
00:48:18,660 --> 00:48:20,020
we melted the cheese?

927
00:48:20,020 --> 00:48:22,740
We put cheese on it and made it real hot.

928
00:48:22,740 --> 00:48:26,980
Taco Bell has taken six month aged sharp cheddar cheese.

929
00:48:26,980 --> 00:48:27,540
Old cheese.

930
00:48:29,060 --> 00:48:29,860
There were six-

931
00:48:31,060 --> 00:48:32,580
I'm glad cheese ain't sentient.

932
00:48:32,580 --> 00:48:37,060
Because that means there'll be six months where the cheese is like,

933
00:48:37,060 --> 00:48:39,380
they must be saving me up for something good.

934
00:48:41,380 --> 00:48:42,100
What is it?

935
00:48:42,100 --> 00:48:42,580
What is it?

936
00:48:42,580 --> 00:48:44,500
William H. Macy's birthday?

937
00:48:44,500 --> 00:48:47,460
Yeah, I'm headed for big things, suckers.

938
00:48:48,180 --> 00:48:49,700
Audios, I'm going to be-

939
00:48:49,700 --> 00:48:50,180
Oh, what?

940
00:48:52,820 --> 00:48:54,100
Outside of a chalupa.

941
00:48:54,100 --> 00:48:54,500
What's up?

942
00:48:54,500 --> 00:48:54,980
What's up?

943
00:48:54,980 --> 00:48:55,780
It's nice to be here.

944
00:48:55,780 --> 00:49:00,100
So you're your new dirty ground beef.

945
00:49:00,100 --> 00:49:00,600
Uh-oh.

946
00:49:00,600 --> 00:49:05,160
Oh, it's toasted on the iconic chalupa shell

947
00:49:05,160 --> 00:49:07,720
to create a crispy blanket of flavor and texture,

948
00:49:08,360 --> 00:49:11,400
unlocking a whole new cheese experience.

949
00:49:13,080 --> 00:49:14,760
That's this week's Munch Squad.

950
00:49:14,760 --> 00:49:15,720
Thank you for indulging me.

951
00:49:15,720 --> 00:49:30,440
Thank you, Munch Squad.

952
00:49:30,440 --> 00:49:31,400
Oh, hello there.

953
00:49:31,400 --> 00:49:35,640
This is Griffin McElroy, the littlest one of the three of them.

954
00:49:35,640 --> 00:49:39,160
And yeah, thanks for listening to this live episode from,

955
00:49:39,160 --> 00:49:42,440
gosh, last September that we did in Washington, DC.

956
00:49:42,440 --> 00:49:43,800
I tried to give you all a heads up,

957
00:49:43,800 --> 00:49:47,800
but Travis and Teresa have just welcomed a new human being

958
00:49:47,800 --> 00:49:48,760
into the planet Earth.

959
00:49:48,760 --> 00:49:50,920
And so things are going to be a little bit up in the air

960
00:49:50,920 --> 00:49:52,440
for a while.

961
00:49:53,240 --> 00:49:55,560
So yeah, get a live one this week, next week,

962
00:49:55,560 --> 00:49:57,640
maybe another live one, maybe a Bro's Better, Bro's Best.

963
00:49:57,640 --> 00:49:58,200
I don't know.

964
00:49:58,200 --> 00:49:58,520
I don't know.

965
00:49:58,520 --> 00:49:59,640
We're figuring it out as we go,

966
00:49:59,640 --> 00:50:01,880
building the plane under our butts as we fly it.

967
00:50:02,600 --> 00:50:04,440
But thank you all so much for sticking with us.

968
00:50:04,440 --> 00:50:08,120
And of course, congratulations to Travis and Teresa.

969
00:50:08,120 --> 00:50:09,960
We're all super, super happy for them.

970
00:50:09,960 --> 00:50:12,520
And we're also super happy that stamps.com has decided

971
00:50:12,520 --> 00:50:15,480
to sponsor us this episode, equally happy, I would say,

972
00:50:16,360 --> 00:50:19,320
because New Year's resolutions, they are difficult to keep.

973
00:50:19,320 --> 00:50:20,360

But here's an easy one that you can do, a resolution, I mean.

00:50:45,160 --> 00:50:46,040

00:52:18,680 --> 00:52:20,120
doing Taz and Mabim Bam,

1027
00:52:20,120 --> 00:52:22,040
and we're figuring out what we're gonna be doing

1028
00:52:22,040 --> 00:52:23,320
for touring for the rest of the year.

1029
00:52:23,880 --> 00:52:25,480
Got the JoCo Cruise coming up in March,

1030
00:52:25,480 --> 00:52:26,920
but we're looking into the future

1031
00:52:26,920 --> 00:52:30,040
for the Fill Your Life with Laughter and Love Tour 2020.

1032
00:52:30,040 --> 00:52:31,800
Looking forward to that.

1033
00:52:32,360 --> 00:52:35,000
I believe pre-orders are still open for the Taz board game.

1034
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:36,760
You can go to theadventurezonegame.com.

1035
00:52:36,760 --> 00:52:38,760
We've been working on some new content for that

1036
00:52:38,760 --> 00:52:40,840
that we're all really excited about.

1037
00:52:40,840 --> 00:52:44,200
And Graphic Novel 3 of the Adventure Zone Graphic Novel series

1038
00:52:44,200 --> 00:52:45,480
is also available to pre-order.

1039
00:52:45,480 --> 00:52:46,760
That one's coming out this summer.

1040
00:52:46,760 --> 00:52:48,600
You can go to theadventurezonecomic.com

1041
00:52:48,600 --> 00:52:49,720
and check that all out.

1042
00:52:50,280 --> 00:52:52,200
I think that that's probably gonna do it.

1043
00:52:52,200 --> 00:52:53,560
Again, we'll be back next Monday,

1044
00:52:53,560 --> 00:52:55,880
probably with another sort of special episode

1045
00:52:55,880 --> 00:52:58,840
to fill the gap while Travis and Teresa are away

1046
00:52:58,840 --> 00:53:01,240
enjoying the new human being that they've created.

1047
00:53:01,800 --> 00:53:04,200
So yeah, we'll be back next week with something

1048
00:53:04,200 --> 00:53:05,560
and we'll talk to you then.

1049
00:53:05,560 --> 00:53:07,560
Bye.

1050
00:53:07,560 --> 00:53:10,680
Hey gang, Jesse here, the founder of Maximum Fun.

1051
00:53:10,680 --> 00:53:14,200
And with me is Stacey Molesky, who is, among other things,

1052
00:53:14,200 --> 00:53:16,440
the lady who responds to all of your tweets.

1053
00:53:16,440 --> 00:53:19,320
Hi everyone, I also send you newsletters.

1054
00:53:19,320 --> 00:53:21,240
So anyway, something really awesome.

1055
00:53:21,880 --> 00:53:24,520
You, MaxFun listeners, have given us the chance

1056
00:53:24,520 --> 00:53:28,440
to do something really cool on behalf of our entire community

1057
00:53:28,440 --> 00:53:30,040
and we wanted to tell you about it.

1058
00:53:30,040 --> 00:53:31,960
Last summer, following the MaxFun Drive,

1059
00:53:31,960 --> 00:53:35,240
we put all of the enamel pins on sale to $10 and up members.

1060
00:53:35,240 --> 00:53:38,920
With proceeds going to the National CASA GAL Association for Children.

1061
00:53:38,920 --> 00:53:43,480
Your generous support and enthusiasm raised over $100,000.

1062
00:53:45,720 --> 00:53:47,800
Our bookkeeper, Steph, would be quick to tell me

1063
00:53:47,800 --> 00:53:53,800
the exact total is $109,025, to be exact.

1064
00:53:53,800 --> 00:53:57,400
Your money will go toward parent kids who've experienced abuse or neglect

1065
00:53:57,400 --> 00:54:01,000
with court-appointed advocates or guardian ad litem volunteers.

1066
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:05,080
In other words, kids in tough spots will have somebody in their corner.

1067
00:54:05,080 --> 00:54:08,360
Knowledgeable grown-ups who are on their team through court dates

1068
00:54:08,360 --> 00:54:11,880
and life upheavals and confusing situations, whatever.

1069
00:54:11,880 --> 00:54:15,240
The money we raise together is going to help a lot of kids.

1070
00:54:15,240 --> 00:54:16,760
Whether you bought pins or not,

1071
00:54:16,760 --> 00:54:21,640
you can help us build on that $109,000 foundation.

1072
00:54:22,280 --> 00:54:25,800
Make a donation to support National CASA GAL

1073
00:54:25,800 --> 00:54:28,840
and help some of our nation's most vulnerable children

1074
00:54:28,840 --> 00:54:33,720
at maximumfun.org slash CASA.

1075
00:54:33,720 --> 00:54:36,760
That's maximumfun.org slash CASA.

1076
00:54:36,760 --> 00:54:38,440
And seriously, thank you.

1077
00:54:38,440 --> 00:54:39,480
Our community rules.

1078
00:54:46,600 --> 00:54:47,720
There was a question.

1079
00:54:47,720 --> 00:54:50,440
There's a question that was sent to us that we're not going to get to.

1080
00:54:50,440 --> 00:54:52,920
A lot of people send us jokey jokes and that's fine and everything,

1081
00:54:52,920 --> 00:54:55,480
but it doesn't give us a long runway to go off of.

1082
00:54:55,480 --> 00:54:58,040
But somebody sent one and that was really, really funny.

1083
00:54:59,800 --> 00:55:01,320
So we're not going to do this question,

1084
00:55:01,320 --> 00:55:03,880
but I wanted to read it out loud because it cracked us the fuck up.

1085
00:55:04,760 --> 00:55:08,040
Jesse in section N, row J, seat one asked...

1086
00:55:09,720 --> 00:55:10,280
Crushed it.

1087
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:14,200
Asked, I keep accidentally tricking people into thinking

1088
00:55:14,200 --> 00:55:17,640
I know shit about astrology by saying yikes to their sign.

1089
00:55:20,200 --> 00:55:22,760
That is a solid ass bit.

1090
00:55:22,760 --> 00:55:23,560
A good bit.

1091
00:55:24,120 --> 00:55:25,320
It's a quality bit.

1092
00:55:25,320 --> 00:55:26,440
Oh, I'm a Gemini.

1093
00:55:27,400 --> 00:55:27,800
Yikes.

1094
00:55:27,800 --> 00:55:29,000
People are going to steal that.

1095
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:30,760
It's going to be all over DC soon.

1096
00:55:30,760 --> 00:55:31,320
Yikes.

1097
00:55:31,320 --> 00:55:31,880
All right.

1098
00:55:31,880 --> 00:55:32,440
Yikes.

1099
00:55:32,440 --> 00:55:33,160
Oh, you're...

1100
00:55:33,160 --> 00:55:34,840
Ooh, Taurus.

1101
00:55:35,720 --> 00:55:36,120
Yikes.

1102
00:55:36,120 --> 00:55:39,240
Let's begin.

1103
00:55:39,240 --> 00:55:39,560
Hello.

1104
00:55:40,120 --> 00:55:42,120
Everybody seems to have congregated on the stage.

1105
00:55:42,120 --> 00:55:42,600
Right, microphone?

1106
00:55:42,600 --> 00:55:43,560
That's totally fine.

1107
00:55:43,560 --> 00:55:44,040
Let's begin.

1108
00:55:44,040 --> 00:55:44,680
Hi, what's your name?

1109
00:55:45,960 --> 00:55:46,360
Hello.

1110
00:55:46,360 --> 00:55:47,240
Hi, Autumn.

1111
00:55:47,240 --> 00:55:47,640
Autumn.

1112
00:55:48,920 --> 00:55:50,040
Hi, how's it going?

1113
00:55:50,040 --> 00:55:52,280
Yeah, now this is your part.

1114
00:55:52,280 --> 00:55:52,920
Okay, okay.

1115
00:55:53,480 --> 00:55:55,400
We don't have a question for you.

1116
00:55:55,400 --> 00:55:55,640
Right.

1117
00:55:56,600 --> 00:56:00,360
My question was, what should I do with all these teeth?

1118
00:56:00,360 --> 00:56:01,960
Yeah, yeah.

1119
00:56:01,960 --> 00:56:04,600
So we had some follow ups.

1120
00:56:04,600 --> 00:56:05,240
I lied.

1121
00:56:05,240 --> 00:56:07,000
We do have questions for you.

1122
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:11,080
Where did you get them?

1123
00:56:11,080 --> 00:56:12,840
With, I'm sorry, with teeth?

1124
00:56:13,640 --> 00:56:13,880
Okay.

1125
00:56:14,520 --> 00:56:17,160
Wait, can I get a bit more Autumn in my monitor, please?

1126
00:56:17,160 --> 00:56:18,840
Because it sounded like Autumn said teeth.

1127
00:56:20,200 --> 00:56:20,440
Okay.

1128
00:56:21,480 --> 00:56:23,720
So I was sitting in my sister's car the other day.

1129
00:56:23,720 --> 00:56:24,360
Okay.

1130
00:56:24,360 --> 00:56:26,600
Not how I expected this to start.

1131
00:56:26,600 --> 00:56:27,880
Please, I'm on pins and needles here.

1132
00:56:27,880 --> 00:56:30,520
I opened the glove box and holy shit.

1133
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:36,840
So she had this like purple chest in her cup holder.

1134
00:56:37,400 --> 00:56:41,560
And so I looked inside it and it had three human teeth in it.

1135
00:56:42,520 --> 00:56:43,320
Okay.

1136
00:56:43,320 --> 00:56:45,000
That's way more than I expected you to say.

1137
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:45,240
Okay.

1138
00:56:47,480 --> 00:56:50,840
So I turned to my sister who's driving the car and I say,

1139
00:56:50,840 --> 00:56:52,440
why do you have a bunch of teeth?

1140
00:56:52,440 --> 00:56:53,080
Fair.

1141
00:56:53,080 --> 00:56:53,320
Yes.

1142
00:56:53,320 --> 00:56:57,880
Yes, she said they belong to her children.

1143
00:56:57,880 --> 00:57:02,600
She doesn't want to tell her children that the tooth fairy gave them back to her.

1144
00:57:03,880 --> 00:57:04,680
Wait, hold up.

1145
00:57:04,680 --> 00:57:06,040
That's what she would say?

1146
00:57:07,880 --> 00:57:11,000
She's the worst liar fucking ever.

1147
00:57:11,720 --> 00:57:17,560
The tooth fairy said your teeth are busted and super brittle.

1148
00:57:17,560 --> 00:57:19,880
And she's also keeping them in a cup holder?

1149
00:57:19,880 --> 00:57:20,200
Okay.

1150
00:57:20,200 --> 00:57:24,200
Does she not know that garbage cans exist?

1151
00:57:24,200 --> 00:57:27,880
She said she didn't feel right throwing part of her kid's body out.

1152
00:57:28,440 --> 00:57:29,000
No.

1153
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:29,880
No, that's decent.

1154
00:57:29,880 --> 00:57:30,440
That's good.

1155
00:57:30,440 --> 00:57:31,000
That's fair.

1156
00:57:31,720 --> 00:57:31,960
So.

1157
00:57:33,240 --> 00:57:37,400
How does this story end with you receiving the teeth, Autumn?

1158
00:57:38,680 --> 00:57:40,040
What did you say?

1159
00:57:40,040 --> 00:57:41,560
Well, here's what I said.

1160
00:57:42,600 --> 00:57:45,480
We were actually listening to a Mabim Bambit on YouTube.

1161
00:57:45,480 --> 00:57:47,000
Don't put this on fucking us.

1162
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:49,800
Don't you dare.

1163
00:57:50,840 --> 00:57:51,640
We're good.

1164
00:57:51,640 --> 00:57:52,600
We're good people.

1165
00:57:52,600 --> 00:57:53,320
We're good people.

1166
00:57:53,320 --> 00:57:55,480
You're the one who said, yum, yum, give me some of them teeth.

1167
00:57:57,000 --> 00:57:57,720
Autumn.

1168
00:57:57,720 --> 00:57:58,120
Autumn.

1169
00:57:59,160 --> 00:58:03,800
So then, so I said that I was coming to see you live and that you take advice questions

1170
00:58:03,800 --> 00:58:04,680
from the audience.

1171
00:58:04,680 --> 00:58:06,200
You didn't fucking bring the teeth.

1172
00:58:06,200 --> 00:58:08,520
She said I should ask you what to do with the teeth.

1173
00:58:08,520 --> 00:58:10,120
But you didn't bring the teeth.

1174
00:58:10,120 --> 00:58:10,680
Well, I didn't.

1175
00:58:10,680 --> 00:58:11,640
I don't have them with me.

1176
00:58:11,640 --> 00:58:12,040
Thank you.

1177
00:58:13,560 --> 00:58:14,280
That's correct.

1178
00:58:14,280 --> 00:58:17,960
I was about to edit in the sound of, like, a maraca just to freak everybody's fucking

1179
00:58:17,960 --> 00:58:18,520
bean at home.

1180
00:58:19,560 --> 00:58:21,480
Hey, Autumn, throw them away.

1181
00:58:21,480 --> 00:58:22,760
Put them in the garb, bitch.

1182
00:58:23,480 --> 00:58:25,000
She doesn't want to do that.

1183
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:25,640
Why not?

1184
00:58:27,160 --> 00:58:28,520
Because they're part of her kid's body.

1185
00:58:28,520 --> 00:58:29,080
No, they're not.

1186
00:58:29,080 --> 00:58:31,880
So is the pee-poo-tooth of the fucking female.

1187
00:58:31,880 --> 00:58:33,640
So is hair you cut off.

1188
00:58:34,840 --> 00:58:37,480
You don't keep all the hair, do you, Autumn?

1189
00:58:37,480 --> 00:58:38,520
Now, wait a minute.

1190
00:58:38,520 --> 00:58:39,000
Hold on.

1191
00:58:39,960 --> 00:58:42,280
Autumn, we're coming at you pretty aggro right now.

1192
00:58:42,280 --> 00:58:43,800
I want to take a step back.

1193
00:58:43,800 --> 00:58:49,320
I will acknowledge, I will cede this to you, that teeth are a more precious part of my

1194
00:58:49,320 --> 00:58:53,400
body than hair, my fingernails, my poopy.

1195
00:58:53,400 --> 00:58:55,240
My hair is the most special part of my body.

1196
00:58:55,240 --> 00:58:55,880
Go on.

1197
00:58:55,880 --> 00:59:01,240
If I lose a tooth now, I will have the thought of, well, should I do something with this?

1198
00:59:01,240 --> 00:59:02,760
I won't do that with anything else.

1199
00:59:02,760 --> 00:59:04,760
So there is something to this question.

1200
00:59:04,760 --> 00:59:06,680
You wouldn't do that with any other part of your body.

1201
00:59:08,680 --> 00:59:13,400
If you lost another part of your body, you would feel more cool chucking it than all

1202
00:59:13,400 --> 00:59:13,900
the tooth.

1203
00:59:14,680 --> 00:59:16,040
On the scale of loo-

1204
00:59:16,040 --> 00:59:17,880
Anyway, Travis, you know what I'm saying.

1205
00:59:20,440 --> 00:59:23,880
Uh, throw them away.

1206
00:59:25,880 --> 00:59:27,480
I mean, okay.

1207
00:59:28,760 --> 00:59:30,680
I don't think she's going to want them back.

1208
00:59:32,520 --> 00:59:33,020
Right?

1209
00:59:33,640 --> 00:59:36,360
So I did find a place in Baltimore that buys human teeth.

1210
00:59:36,360 --> 00:59:36,760
Oh my god.

1211
00:59:36,760 --> 00:59:37,160
Now we're talking about-

1212
00:59:37,160 --> 00:59:38,600
No, you cannot!

1213
00:59:38,600 --> 00:59:39,720
Don't do it!

1214
00:59:39,720 --> 00:59:40,840
Yes, do it.

1215
00:59:40,840 --> 00:59:45,320
No, because in three years you'll see some people who look a lot like your nieces and

1216
00:59:45,320 --> 00:59:46,440
nephews running around.

1217
00:59:47,320 --> 00:59:47,880
So, okay.

1218
00:59:47,880 --> 00:59:49,160
What does the place in Baltimore do with them?

1219
00:59:49,960 --> 00:59:52,040
Uh, it makes them into jewelry.

1220
00:59:52,040 --> 00:59:52,360
Yes.

1221
00:59:52,360 --> 00:59:53,080
Yes, makes them into-

1222
00:59:53,080 --> 00:59:54,360
Oh, I actually know that rule.

1223
00:59:54,360 --> 00:59:54,840
Do that.

1224
00:59:54,840 --> 00:59:55,560
Hey, wait.

1225
00:59:55,560 --> 00:59:57,080
Get that for your sister.

1226
00:59:57,080 --> 00:59:57,640
Hey, wait.

1227
00:59:58,600 --> 01:00:04,520
So there is an actual tooth fairy, but it's a company in Baltimore.

1228
01:00:04,520 --> 01:00:05,880
Is that what you're saying to me?

1229
01:00:05,880 --> 01:00:13,320
So, Autumn, if I may, what you have done, and listen, I appreciate this because it gave

1230
01:00:13,320 --> 01:00:17,160
us something to talk about, but you said, what should I do with these teeth that I already

1231
01:00:17,160 --> 01:00:18,360
figured out something to do with?

1232
01:00:19,240 --> 01:00:22,840
Well, I actually only called that place after I submitted the question.

1233
01:00:22,840 --> 01:00:23,640
Okay, okay, okay.

1234
01:00:23,640 --> 01:00:24,360
Okay, fair enough.

1235
01:00:24,360 --> 01:00:25,800
But, hey, cool.

1236
01:00:25,800 --> 01:00:31,640
Don't fucking sell your nieces and nephews teeth to a fucking strange company in Baltimore!

1237
01:00:31,640 --> 01:00:32,760
Throw them in the garbage!

1238
01:00:32,760 --> 01:00:36,840
No, but you could pay to have them made into jewelry for your sister.

1239
01:00:36,840 --> 01:00:39,400
Oh, thanks for this great necklace, Autumn.

1240
01:00:39,400 --> 01:00:40,280
I love it.

1241
01:00:40,280 --> 01:00:41,000
This is great.

1242
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:44,760
It is a step up from a plastic cup in a cup holder.

1243
01:00:44,760 --> 01:00:48,360
This is perfect for me, a Klingon blood warrior.

1244
01:00:50,760 --> 01:00:52,280
Does that help, Autumn?

1245
01:00:52,280 --> 01:00:53,080
Yeah, yeah.

1246
01:00:53,080 --> 01:00:53,720
Thank you, Autumn.

1247
01:00:55,720 --> 01:00:56,600
Big hand, big hand.

1248
01:00:58,520 --> 01:01:00,200
How about, uh-

1249
01:01:00,200 --> 01:01:02,840
What do you have for sale on nasty eBay?

1250
01:01:02,840 --> 01:01:04,600
Which this show has apparently become.

1251
01:01:04,600 --> 01:01:06,200
Katelyn row F, seat one.

1252
01:01:06,200 --> 01:01:09,560
Head on down for the ad, join the queue.

1253
01:01:09,560 --> 01:01:09,880
Hello.

1254
01:01:10,520 --> 01:01:12,040
Hi, um, okay.

1255
01:01:12,040 --> 01:01:13,400
I'm kind of freaking out right now.

1256
01:01:13,400 --> 01:01:14,360
You got this?

1257
01:01:14,360 --> 01:01:15,160
You've got this.

1258
01:01:15,160 --> 01:01:16,120
What's your name?

1259
01:01:16,120 --> 01:01:17,000
I'm Tara.

1260
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:17,800
Hello, Tara.

1261
01:01:18,520 --> 01:01:24,680
So, I am selling my weird cursed Photoshop things on eBay, apparently.

1262
01:01:24,680 --> 01:01:25,000
Okay.

1263
01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:26,040
So, I'm taking-

1264
01:01:26,040 --> 01:01:27,640
Is this a surprise to you?

1265
01:01:27,640 --> 01:01:27,800
No.

1266
01:01:27,800 --> 01:01:36,280
No, um, so my grandmother keeps asking me about this new digital art class that I'm

1267
01:01:36,280 --> 01:01:37,400
taking in school.

1268
01:01:37,400 --> 01:01:37,640
Right.

1269
01:01:37,640 --> 01:01:40,040
It's a considerate thing for your grandma to do.

1270
01:01:40,040 --> 01:01:47,880
But, um, what we do in digital art is our teacher lets us do whatever we want in Photoshop.

1271
01:01:47,880 --> 01:01:48,120
Okay.

1272
01:01:48,120 --> 01:01:48,840
And we are about-

1273
01:01:48,840 --> 01:01:50,520
That's a bad teacher, y'all.

1274
01:01:50,520 --> 01:01:51,880
He, like, gives us-

1275
01:01:51,880 --> 01:01:53,720
Are you paying to go to this school?

1276
01:01:53,720 --> 01:01:55,160
You could do that at home.

1277
01:01:55,160 --> 01:01:59,960
He, like, gives us general guidelines, but for example, you had to combine a bunch of

1278
01:01:59,960 --> 01:02:05,000
images in a landscape, and I made a giant crab with laser eyes attacking Ocean City.

1279
01:02:05,000 --> 01:02:05,160
Okay.

1280
01:02:05,160 --> 01:02:05,880
Wait, sick.

1281
01:02:05,880 --> 01:02:05,960
Sick.

1282
01:02:10,280 --> 01:02:10,600
Yeah.

1283
01:02:10,600 --> 01:02:16,760
But, um, I'm not sure how I tell my grandmother this is a thing that I submitted in class

1284
01:02:16,760 --> 01:02:18,440
and that I get graded on.

1285
01:02:18,440 --> 01:02:18,760
Okay.

1286
01:02:19,400 --> 01:02:23,800
You don't want your grandmother to see your crab monster art.

1287
01:02:23,800 --> 01:02:26,360
What if it turns out your grandmother loves it?

1288
01:02:26,360 --> 01:02:31,000
I have to say, that's definitely the pure and true and good and nice answer to this

1289
01:02:31,000 --> 01:02:31,800
question.

1290
01:02:31,800 --> 01:02:38,840
I must say, when I did read your question in our inbox, I did think, uh, how do I explain

1291
01:02:38,840 --> 01:02:42,840
to my grandmother that my digital art projects are not something she wants to see would be

1292
01:02:42,840 --> 01:02:45,560
a little bit more, how do I say, um-

1293
01:02:45,560 --> 01:02:50,120
Yeah, I was talking with my friend after I submitted it, like, oh, they're gonna think

1294
01:02:50,120 --> 01:02:51,160
about it that way.

1295
01:02:51,160 --> 01:02:51,720
Yeah.

1296
01:02:51,720 --> 01:02:52,200
Yeah.

1297
01:02:52,200 --> 01:02:53,000
Yeah.

1298
01:02:54,120 --> 01:02:55,160
You wrote it, right?

1299
01:02:55,160 --> 01:02:58,680
You wrote the question with your, like, your physical body.

1300
01:02:58,680 --> 01:03:01,720
You know, have you ever done any nasty digital art?

1301
01:03:01,720 --> 01:03:02,760
I'm dying up here.

1302
01:03:02,760 --> 01:03:03,720
Give us something.

1303
01:03:03,720 --> 01:03:05,000
I'm gonna hit you with something, Tara.

1304
01:03:05,000 --> 01:03:07,400
Well, it's not a crab, but, like, sexy.

1305
01:03:07,400 --> 01:03:08,760
Sexual crab.

1306
01:03:08,760 --> 01:03:09,240
You know-

1307
01:03:09,240 --> 01:03:12,840
I mean, is merging the faces of Hillary Clinton and Markiplier sexy?

1308
01:03:12,840 --> 01:03:13,480
Because I did-

1309
01:03:14,840 --> 01:03:15,160
I don't-

1310
01:03:16,280 --> 01:03:18,200
I'm not here to yuck any yums.

1311
01:03:19,000 --> 01:03:20,600
Tara, I'm gonna hit you with something.

1312
01:03:20,600 --> 01:03:21,240
Not literally.

1313
01:03:21,240 --> 01:03:21,880
Not literally.

1314
01:03:21,880 --> 01:03:23,800
We get mad-

1315
01:03:23,800 --> 01:03:27,080
We get so mad at old people for not knowing about everything.

1316
01:03:28,040 --> 01:03:33,480
But maybe it's because we get to a point where we stop showing them all the cool shit.

1317
01:03:35,160 --> 01:03:38,840
Maybe if we weren't so afraid to expose our old people to cool shit,

1318
01:03:38,840 --> 01:03:40,760
I wouldn't have to explain everything to my dad.

1319
01:03:42,440 --> 01:03:46,360
Maybe he would just know about dope shit, and I wouldn't have to try to sit him down

1320
01:03:46,360 --> 01:03:49,400
and do a PowerPoint about how Steven Universe works.

1321
01:03:49,400 --> 01:03:53,160
Like, maybe I could just fucking let him watch it.

1322
01:03:53,160 --> 01:03:55,160
We had a powerful moment last tour.

1323
01:03:55,160 --> 01:03:56,760
We were in Atlanta.

1324
01:03:56,760 --> 01:04:00,120
I remember we were backstage, and I broke down in tears

1325
01:04:00,120 --> 01:04:01,400
because of the moment I was having with dad

1326
01:04:01,400 --> 01:04:03,560
where I did all my Fortnite dances in front of him.

1327
01:04:06,040 --> 01:04:06,760
Maybe-

1328
01:04:06,760 --> 01:04:08,840
There is a beautiful possibility here, Tara,

1329
01:04:08,840 --> 01:04:12,600
that you show your grandmother this crab attacking a thing,

1330
01:04:12,600 --> 01:04:16,920
and your grandmother goes and steps over to the closet and pulls out,

1331
01:04:16,920 --> 01:04:20,760
and she has cut out of magazines the same thing from 1942

1332
01:04:22,040 --> 01:04:24,520
and has made the exact same picture,

1333
01:04:25,240 --> 01:04:28,840
and then you finally connect with her on a very deep personal level.

1334
01:04:28,840 --> 01:04:31,560
Or it'll be like Charlie Chaplin holding a beach ball,

1335
01:04:31,560 --> 01:04:32,920
and she'll be like, fucking get it.

1336
01:04:34,680 --> 01:04:36,520
Did you see this meme I made?

1337
01:04:36,520 --> 01:04:37,480
Yeah, it's great.

1338
01:04:37,480 --> 01:04:39,320
Yeah, you got him.

1339
01:04:39,320 --> 01:04:40,520
I'm gonna take a wild-

1340
01:04:40,520 --> 01:04:43,480
Tara, how well do you know your grandma and your grandma know you?

1341
01:04:44,840 --> 01:04:46,520
Well, we live with each other,

1342
01:04:46,520 --> 01:04:47,240
so I know her-

1343
01:04:47,240 --> 01:04:48,680
Okay, okay, that's pretty good.

1344
01:04:49,320 --> 01:04:50,440
I'm gonna hit you with something.

1345
01:04:51,160 --> 01:04:52,440
Again, this is number two.

1346
01:04:53,800 --> 01:04:57,160
Your grandma knows you're not painting sunflowers, Tara.

1347
01:04:57,160 --> 01:04:58,040
She knows you.

1348
01:04:58,040 --> 01:04:59,720
She knows you're getting weird.

1349
01:04:59,720 --> 01:05:01,400
Just let her see your weird art.

1350
01:05:01,400 --> 01:05:03,240
It'll be less weird than she thinks,

1351
01:05:03,240 --> 01:05:06,120
as evidenced by us reading your questions.

1352
01:05:06,120 --> 01:05:09,320
Yes, it's so much worse for her not knowing.

1353
01:05:09,320 --> 01:05:09,960
Oh, Nana.

1354
01:05:11,080 --> 01:05:11,560
Nana.

1355
01:05:11,560 --> 01:05:12,680
It's a giant crab.

1356
01:05:12,680 --> 01:05:13,560
Oh, thank God.

1357
01:05:13,560 --> 01:05:15,720
Oh, thank God it's a giant crab.

1358
01:05:15,720 --> 01:05:16,520
Tell me everything.

1359
01:05:16,520 --> 01:05:19,160
At least I have some point of reference for that.

1360
01:05:19,160 --> 01:05:19,560
Yeah.

1361
01:05:19,560 --> 01:05:20,200
Does that help?

1362
01:05:20,760 --> 01:05:21,320
Yes, thank you.

1363
01:05:21,320 --> 01:05:21,880
Good, good, excellent.

1364
01:05:21,880 --> 01:05:22,200
Thank you.

1365
01:05:26,600 --> 01:05:27,160
Hello.

1366
01:05:27,160 --> 01:05:27,720
Hello.

1367
01:05:27,720 --> 01:05:28,200
Hello.

1368
01:05:28,200 --> 01:05:28,920
What's up?

1369
01:05:28,920 --> 01:05:29,880
Hi, I'm Kyle.

1370
01:05:29,880 --> 01:05:30,440
Hi, Kyle.

1371
01:05:31,320 --> 01:05:33,800
So, I was at my office.

1372
01:05:34,440 --> 01:05:35,720
I worked at a music school.

1373
01:05:36,360 --> 01:05:38,600
Lovely place with a lot of classical music everywhere.

1374
01:05:38,600 --> 01:05:39,640
Very professional setting.

1375
01:05:39,640 --> 01:05:40,280
Yeah, yeah.

1376
01:05:40,280 --> 01:05:40,680
And one day my-

1377
01:05:40,680 --> 01:05:41,480
I cracked your code.

1378
01:05:41,480 --> 01:05:42,760
I know exactly where you're talking.

1379
01:05:42,760 --> 01:05:45,960
Dang, one day my boss came in and she said,

1380
01:05:45,960 --> 01:05:48,280
are you guys familiar with Beyblades at all?

1381
01:05:51,800 --> 01:05:53,800
That's a bold way to lead into that.

1382
01:05:53,800 --> 01:05:54,280
Go on.

1383
01:05:54,280 --> 01:05:57,320
Yeah, well, I said, would you like to see some?

1384
01:05:59,640 --> 01:06:02,280
You didn't for a second think this is a trap?

1385
01:06:02,280 --> 01:06:03,160
Yeah, that's a trap.

1386
01:06:04,120 --> 01:06:06,120
I thought maybe a raise was involved,

1387
01:06:06,120 --> 01:06:08,120
but I had some Beyblades-

1388
01:06:08,120 --> 01:06:09,400
How the heck do you know about Beyblades?

1389
01:06:09,400 --> 01:06:10,840
Here's $5,000.

1390
01:06:10,840 --> 01:06:12,840
Here's $5,000.

1391
01:06:14,440 --> 01:06:15,960
You never know, it's the arts.

1392
01:06:15,960 --> 01:06:16,840
But we went-

1393
01:06:16,840 --> 01:06:20,200
I had a couple Beyblades and an arena in my trunk.

1394
01:06:22,840 --> 01:06:23,340
And-

1395
01:06:24,920 --> 01:06:26,360
In case of what?

1396
01:06:26,360 --> 01:06:26,860
Yeah.

1397
01:06:28,840 --> 01:06:29,800
A challenger.

1398
01:06:31,080 --> 01:06:33,720
In case you're being mugged by some tufts

1399
01:06:33,720 --> 01:06:34,520
and you'd be like,

1400
01:06:34,520 --> 01:06:36,840
let's settle this on the Beyblade arena.

1401
01:06:38,200 --> 01:06:39,960
Beyblades, let's rip.

1402
01:06:39,960 --> 01:06:42,280
Oh, you did stab me.

1403
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:46,360
Why did I unlock my car trunk for you?

1404
01:06:46,360 --> 01:06:47,960
I've made this so much easier.

1405
01:06:47,960 --> 01:06:49,720
I'm just going to go ahead and get in here.

1406
01:06:50,440 --> 01:06:51,480
All you've got is a knife?

1407
01:06:51,480 --> 01:06:53,400
Well, brrrrrz.

1408
01:06:53,400 --> 01:06:54,600
I've got a blade.

1409
01:06:54,600 --> 01:06:55,640
Oh, God, I'm bleeding.

1410
01:06:55,640 --> 01:06:56,600
Oh, no, no, no.

1411
01:06:56,600 --> 01:06:58,120
So what happened next?

1412
01:06:58,120 --> 01:06:59,720
Yeah, so I brought him into the office

1413
01:07:00,280 --> 01:07:02,120
and I left him there for a while.

1414
01:07:02,120 --> 01:07:04,040
And then one day I came back in

1415
01:07:04,040 --> 01:07:06,920
and I realized that the arena was still there,

1416
01:07:06,920 --> 01:07:08,280
but the Beyblades were not.

1417
01:07:08,280 --> 01:07:09,640
Oh, no.

1418
01:07:09,640 --> 01:07:10,140
Don't.

1419
01:07:12,840 --> 01:07:13,720
I mean, it's my fault.

1420
01:07:14,840 --> 01:07:17,560
But I'm just desperate to try and figure out

1421
01:07:17,560 --> 01:07:20,680
how to crack the case of my very professional-

1422
01:07:20,680 --> 01:07:23,480
You want us from this stage to tell you

1423
01:07:23,480 --> 01:07:27,320
who in your office saw your Beyblade?

1424
01:07:27,320 --> 01:07:29,960
Did you submit a list of suspects?

1425
01:07:30,760 --> 01:07:31,560
Something?

1426
01:07:31,560 --> 01:07:32,120
Do you have any clues?

1427
01:07:32,120 --> 01:07:34,120
Did you take any kind of detail to counsel

1428
01:07:34,120 --> 01:07:35,400
their comings and goings?

1429
01:07:35,400 --> 01:07:37,400
I'm ready to use my little gray cells

1430
01:07:37,400 --> 01:07:39,000
to solve this problem for you,

1431
01:07:39,000 --> 01:07:40,680
but I need something to go on.

1432
01:07:40,680 --> 01:07:42,840
Can I ask you a very sincere question?

1433
01:07:42,840 --> 01:07:43,320
Yeah, go ahead.

1434
01:07:43,320 --> 01:07:44,200
I want you to answer.

1435
01:07:44,200 --> 01:07:44,700
Sure.

1436
01:07:45,400 --> 01:07:46,440
When you brought them in,

1437
01:07:47,080 --> 01:07:48,280
they were in your office.

1438
01:07:48,280 --> 01:07:48,760
Yes.

1439
01:07:48,760 --> 01:07:52,280
And you decided to leave them in your office.

1440
01:07:52,280 --> 01:07:53,160
It's true.

1441
01:07:53,160 --> 01:07:53,660
Why?

1442
01:07:54,760 --> 01:07:56,840
In case of what?

1443
01:07:58,920 --> 01:07:59,640
Can I try?

1444
01:07:59,640 --> 01:08:01,240
Were you lazy and just didn't fucking feel

1445
01:08:01,240 --> 01:08:02,200
like carrying it back to the car?

1446
01:08:03,000 --> 01:08:03,480
Yeah.

1447
01:08:03,480 --> 01:08:04,120
Okay, yeah.

1448
01:08:04,120 --> 01:08:06,680
Yeah, that's an answer.

1449
01:08:07,480 --> 01:08:09,800
I recognize my kind, air fist bump.

1450
01:08:10,440 --> 01:08:12,440
Have you noticed other people in your office

1451
01:08:12,440 --> 01:08:14,760
seeming especially, I don't know, relaxed?

1452
01:08:14,760 --> 01:08:16,840
Enjoying their life for the first time in forever?

1453
01:08:16,840 --> 01:08:19,320
Travis thinks that this is the therapeutic effect

1454
01:08:19,320 --> 01:08:20,120
of Beyblades.

1455
01:08:21,000 --> 01:08:23,160
Honest to God, I know nothing about them.

1456
01:08:23,160 --> 01:08:24,600
Motherfucking fuck!

1457
01:08:27,720 --> 01:08:31,320
The closest comparison I have is fidget spinners,

1458
01:08:31,320 --> 01:08:33,080
which I find to be very relaxing.

1459
01:08:33,080 --> 01:08:33,800
Trapped.

1460
01:08:33,800 --> 01:08:36,440
You've got to put more better Beyblades in there

1461
01:08:36,440 --> 01:08:37,480
and set up a camera.

1462
01:08:37,480 --> 01:08:38,840
We set a trap.

1463
01:08:39,720 --> 01:08:40,280
Wait, what?

1464
01:08:40,280 --> 01:08:41,640
You already tried a trap?

1465
01:08:42,680 --> 01:08:43,880
Lead with that!

1466
01:08:43,880 --> 01:08:45,560
Lead with the Beyblade trap!

1467
01:08:45,560 --> 01:08:46,600
It got complicated.

1468
01:08:47,240 --> 01:08:47,880
No, yes!

1469
01:08:47,880 --> 01:08:49,000
That's what I want to hear!

1470
01:08:50,200 --> 01:08:52,840
There wasn't going to be an easy solution to this.

1471
01:08:52,840 --> 01:08:53,800
Certainly, no.

1472
01:08:53,800 --> 01:08:55,320
My Rubik's cube went missing

1473
01:08:55,960 --> 01:08:58,040
and a couple other things around the office,

1474
01:08:58,040 --> 01:09:01,160
and so we left a candy bar on a desk

1475
01:09:01,160 --> 01:09:02,680
precariously placed.

1476
01:09:02,680 --> 01:09:05,000
I didn't know what we thought would happen next,

1477
01:09:06,600 --> 01:09:10,760
but surprise, surprise, it too was gone later.

1478
01:09:10,760 --> 01:09:12,440
You were just trying to prove to yourself

1479
01:09:12,440 --> 01:09:14,360
that things were in fact being stolen?

1480
01:09:16,360 --> 01:09:19,160
And what, becoming sentient and walking away?

1481
01:09:19,160 --> 01:09:21,000
Like Toy Story style?

1482
01:09:21,000 --> 01:09:21,720
You never know.

1483
01:09:21,720 --> 01:09:22,200
Okay.

1484
01:09:22,200 --> 01:09:23,080
No, hey, you do.

1485
01:09:24,360 --> 01:09:25,160
You do know.

1486
01:09:25,160 --> 01:09:26,200
On this one, you do know.

1487
01:09:27,880 --> 01:09:28,440
That was it?

1488
01:09:28,440 --> 01:09:29,800
That was the end of your investigation?

1489
01:09:29,800 --> 01:09:31,160
That was your whole trap?

1490
01:09:31,160 --> 01:09:32,440
Well, I know I'm here.

1491
01:09:32,440 --> 01:09:33,720
What kind of trap?

1492
01:09:33,720 --> 01:09:35,080
That is an offering!

1493
01:09:37,720 --> 01:09:39,640
Yeah, if I figured it out, I wouldn't have asked.

1494
01:09:39,640 --> 01:09:40,680
That's a shitty trap.

1495
01:09:40,680 --> 01:09:42,680
That's like a hunter going out into the woods

1496
01:09:42,680 --> 01:09:45,480
and like laying a carrot down and then leaving.

1497
01:09:47,000 --> 01:09:47,640
Do it again.

1498
01:09:47,640 --> 01:09:50,200
Set up a camera and that'll be that.

1499
01:09:50,200 --> 01:09:53,160
Or just go to the middle of the office.

1500
01:09:53,160 --> 01:09:54,920
Set your arena down.

1501
01:09:54,920 --> 01:09:57,960
Yell something about Beyblade.

1502
01:09:57,960 --> 01:09:59,240
I've never heard it consumed.

1503
01:09:59,240 --> 01:10:01,640
Sorry, this is the one I don't know about, folks.

1504
01:10:03,240 --> 01:10:04,520
So you know it's niche.

1505
01:10:05,080 --> 01:10:09,560
And then you just fucking rip it into that good bowl.

1506
01:10:09,560 --> 01:10:10,840
And if nobody comes around,

1507
01:10:11,800 --> 01:10:13,240
then you won't know who the thief is,

1508
01:10:13,240 --> 01:10:15,240
but you will know that they're chicken shit.

1509
01:10:17,160 --> 01:10:18,120
Does that help?

1510
01:10:18,120 --> 01:10:18,600
Yep.

1511
01:10:18,600 --> 01:10:19,320
Okay, great.

1512
01:10:25,000 --> 01:10:25,640
Feel free.

1513
01:10:25,640 --> 01:10:26,120
Hello.

1514
01:10:26,120 --> 01:10:26,840
Hello.

1515
01:10:26,840 --> 01:10:27,560
Hey, brothers.

1516
01:10:27,560 --> 01:10:28,200
Hi, what's up?

1517
01:10:28,200 --> 01:10:29,400
How's your day?

1518
01:10:29,400 --> 01:10:29,880
Not much.

1519
01:10:29,880 --> 01:10:30,920
Just enjoying a great show.

1520
01:10:30,920 --> 01:10:31,880
Oh, thank you.

1521
01:10:31,880 --> 01:10:32,760
So sweet.

1522
01:10:32,760 --> 01:10:34,280
Not enough people say that, Kyle.

1523
01:10:37,960 --> 01:10:41,960
I like Kyle's double tape magnitude.

1524
01:10:41,960 --> 01:10:44,360
What was your name for yourself?

1525
01:10:44,360 --> 01:10:44,760
Kate.

1526
01:10:44,760 --> 01:10:45,480
Hi, Kate.

1527
01:10:45,480 --> 01:10:46,120
What's your question?

1528
01:10:47,160 --> 01:10:49,800
I'm here with my brother who came to see the show

1529
01:10:49,800 --> 01:10:51,960
just because I asked him to, which is very sweet.

1530
01:10:52,520 --> 01:10:54,600
And we were hanging out before the show

1531
01:10:54,600 --> 01:10:56,520
and we decided to start watching John Wick,

1532
01:10:56,520 --> 01:10:57,800
which I've never seen.

1533
01:10:57,800 --> 01:10:58,120
Yes.

1534
01:10:58,840 --> 01:11:00,600
We're not so great at timing things,

1535
01:11:00,600 --> 01:11:04,040
so we only got to about the halfway point of John Wick.

1536
01:11:04,040 --> 01:11:04,840
Okay.

1537
01:11:04,840 --> 01:11:07,080
And I was hoping that y'all could help me

1538
01:11:07,080 --> 01:11:09,240
feel like I've accomplished both things tonight,

1539
01:11:09,240 --> 01:11:11,560
going to a show and watching John Wick,

1540
01:11:11,560 --> 01:11:15,320
if you could explain the rest of the plot of John Wick to me.

1541
01:11:15,320 --> 01:11:16,360
Okay, wait, hold on.

1542
01:11:17,720 --> 01:11:19,960
What was the last thing you saw?

1543
01:11:21,320 --> 01:11:22,280
No spoilers.

1544
01:11:22,280 --> 01:11:25,160
By the way, this will be a spoiler-free summation

1545
01:11:25,160 --> 01:11:27,720
of the plot of John Wick.

1546
01:11:27,720 --> 01:11:30,440
What was the last thing you saw before you like,

1547
01:11:30,440 --> 01:11:33,320
I assume, hit stop as you walked out the door?

1548
01:11:33,320 --> 01:11:35,720
If you say he shot a Russian,

1549
01:11:35,720 --> 01:11:37,560
I will have you removed from the theater.

1550
01:11:37,560 --> 01:11:39,160
We need some kind of specifics.

1551
01:11:39,960 --> 01:11:43,880
There was some cryptic exchanges happening in a hotel.

1552
01:11:48,760 --> 01:11:51,640
That actually narrows it down 20%.

1553
01:11:51,640 --> 01:11:55,320
To one of the three movies in the John Wick franchise.

1554
01:11:55,320 --> 01:12:01,640
Okay, so John Wick is a pet enthusiast.

1555
01:12:03,400 --> 01:12:05,240
Who loves his car.

1556
01:12:05,960 --> 01:12:09,240
He, not so much if the car carries through

1557
01:12:09,240 --> 01:12:10,520
to any feature movies.

1558
01:12:11,080 --> 01:12:13,880
He's not a gun enthusiast,

1559
01:12:14,920 --> 01:12:17,320
but guns are enthusiastic about him.

1560
01:12:17,320 --> 01:12:23,160
And so there's the,

1561
01:12:23,160 --> 01:12:24,520
you saw what happened to the dog.

1562
01:12:24,520 --> 01:12:25,560
We don't have to get into that.

1563
01:12:25,560 --> 01:12:29,240
That's no, some bad stuff happens to a dog

1564
01:12:29,240 --> 01:12:30,520
and that's unfortunate.

1565
01:12:30,520 --> 01:12:30,920
Yes.

1566
01:12:30,920 --> 01:12:31,640
That's no good.

1567
01:12:31,640 --> 01:12:34,680
But that dog was the fuel for the engine

1568
01:12:34,680 --> 01:12:37,720
that was John Wick's angry, angry carnage.

1569
01:12:37,720 --> 01:12:38,220
Yes.

1570
01:12:39,640 --> 01:12:41,960
And there, okay, we said no spoiler.

1571
01:12:41,960 --> 01:12:42,920
May I, just for a moment?

1572
01:12:42,920 --> 01:12:43,480
Yeah, yeah.

1573
01:12:43,480 --> 01:12:44,600
There's a moment at the end.

1574
01:12:45,400 --> 01:12:46,520
You skip to the end though.

1575
01:12:46,520 --> 01:12:48,440
Yeah, I know, but it ties back in

1576
01:12:49,240 --> 01:12:55,240
where George Carlin shows up in a phone booth

1577
01:12:56,440 --> 01:12:58,360
and they travel back in time and save the dog.

1578
01:12:58,360 --> 01:12:59,240
Yeah, so it's good.

1579
01:13:01,240 --> 01:13:04,760
Hey, and then that dog ushers in

1580
01:13:06,040 --> 01:13:07,880
like an eternity of happiness.

1581
01:13:07,880 --> 01:13:08,920
Hey, hey.

1582
01:13:10,120 --> 01:13:11,640
He shoots everybody and gets a new dog.

1583
01:13:13,560 --> 01:13:15,560
Yeah, but hold on.

1584
01:13:15,560 --> 01:13:18,040
There's no, I mean, he shoots everybody

1585
01:13:19,000 --> 01:13:20,200
and then he gets a new dog.

1586
01:13:20,200 --> 01:13:22,840
He goes to the dog store and the person's like,

1587
01:13:22,840 --> 01:13:23,720
hey, you want a new dog?

1588
01:13:23,720 --> 01:13:24,600
They're a hundred dollars.

1589
01:13:24,600 --> 01:13:26,520
And he's like, bang.

1590
01:13:28,760 --> 01:13:30,120
All these dogs are mine now.

1591
01:13:30,120 --> 01:13:32,200
It's a really casual pet store.

1592
01:13:33,000 --> 01:13:34,520
He also drives a car real cool.

1593
01:13:34,520 --> 01:13:35,960
He drives a car real cool.

1594
01:13:37,240 --> 01:13:39,560
He shoots like a billion guys.

1595
01:13:39,560 --> 01:13:43,080
He like kills the shit out of three young Greyjoys.

1596
01:13:43,080 --> 01:13:45,800
You're just wasting time.

1597
01:13:45,800 --> 01:13:50,440
He kills everybody and then he gets a new dog.

1598
01:13:53,080 --> 01:13:55,080
Feel free to begin John Wick 2

1599
01:13:55,960 --> 01:13:57,480
because now you're caught up.

1600
01:13:58,680 --> 01:14:01,640
He's not going to be riding on the back of a dragon

1601
01:14:01,640 --> 01:14:02,760
on John Wick 2 and you're like,

1602
01:14:02,760 --> 01:14:04,360
what the fuck did they not tell me?

1603
01:14:04,360 --> 01:14:07,560
To be fair though, in John Wick 2 and 3,

1604
01:14:07,560 --> 01:14:08,840
a dog dies at the beginning

1605
01:14:08,840 --> 01:14:10,680
and it gets a new better dog at the end.

1606
01:14:10,680 --> 01:14:12,200
Everyone, everyone.

1607
01:14:12,200 --> 01:14:15,160
It just keeps escalating to a better and better dog.

1608
01:14:15,160 --> 01:14:15,480
Right.

1609
01:14:16,040 --> 01:14:17,400
Hey, does that help?

1610
01:14:17,400 --> 01:14:19,960
In the last movie, he teams up with dog the bounty hunter

1611
01:14:19,960 --> 01:14:20,280
and it's.

1612
01:14:21,560 --> 01:14:22,840
Does that help?

1613
01:14:22,840 --> 01:14:24,040
Is that good?

1614
01:14:24,040 --> 01:14:25,400
That's all extremely helpful.

1615
01:14:25,400 --> 01:14:26,120
Thank you.

1616
01:14:26,120 --> 01:14:26,920
So glad we can help.

1617
01:14:26,920 --> 01:14:28,200
You can bring the house lights down now.

1618
01:14:28,200 --> 01:14:28,920
Thank you so much.

1619
01:14:34,120 --> 01:14:34,840
Hey everybody.

1620
01:14:34,840 --> 01:14:36,440
Thank you so much for coming.

1621
01:14:36,440 --> 01:14:37,800
That's a beautiful painting.

1622
01:14:37,800 --> 01:14:38,840
Yes, thank you.

1623
01:14:38,840 --> 01:14:40,920
And the darkness is here.

1624
01:14:40,920 --> 01:14:43,720
Ah, now it's just me and my brothers.

1625
01:14:44,280 --> 01:14:46,520
So yeah, thank you all so much.

1626
01:14:46,520 --> 01:14:48,200
These last two nights have been wild.

1627
01:14:48,200 --> 01:14:49,080
Y'all are wild.

1628
01:14:49,080 --> 01:14:49,960
Y'all are so good.

1629
01:14:49,960 --> 01:14:51,320
Thank you all so much for coming here.

1630
01:14:55,960 --> 01:14:58,040
It is wild that we were invited to play here

1631
01:14:58,040 --> 01:15:00,520
at Constitution Hall where, you know,

1632
01:15:00,520 --> 01:15:04,600
actual people have performed major big shows.

1633
01:15:04,600 --> 01:15:05,400
Thank you everybody.

1634
01:15:05,400 --> 01:15:06,440
This has been so cool here.

1635
01:15:06,440 --> 01:15:07,000
Thank you so much.

1636
01:15:07,000 --> 01:15:07,640
Yes, thank you.

1637
01:15:07,640 --> 01:15:11,240
Thank you for having us.

1638
01:15:11,240 --> 01:15:14,120
So like, we have to leave very early in the morning

1639
01:15:14,120 --> 01:15:15,000
to head to Pittsburgh.

1640
01:15:17,080 --> 01:15:18,200
Okay, all right.

1641
01:15:18,200 --> 01:15:19,160
Oh, that's weird.

1642
01:15:19,160 --> 01:15:21,240
And like, our families are with us and everything,

1643
01:15:21,240 --> 01:15:24,040
so we're not going to be able to hang out after the show.

1644
01:15:24,040 --> 01:15:24,680
I'm sorry.

1645
01:15:24,680 --> 01:15:25,720
Travis's family's with him.

1646
01:15:25,720 --> 01:15:26,520
I'm just tired.

1647
01:15:28,440 --> 01:15:30,360
I have to soak my arms in ice.

1648
01:15:30,360 --> 01:15:30,840
Yes.

1649
01:15:30,840 --> 01:15:32,600
So yeah, we're not going to hang out after the show,

1650
01:15:32,600 --> 01:15:34,840
but we hope that our time with you now

1651
01:15:34,840 --> 01:15:40,600
has felt like a close communion with the good Lord above.

1652
01:15:40,600 --> 01:15:46,200
And thank you to Paul for all he does for us.

1653
01:15:47,320 --> 01:15:48,440
Thank you to...

1654
01:15:48,440 --> 01:15:55,240
If you haven't already, check out Paulandstorm.gov.biz.

1655
01:15:55,240 --> 01:15:56,360
Anyone will get you there.

1656
01:15:56,360 --> 01:15:58,440
.net.xxx.

1657
01:15:58,440 --> 01:15:59,640
Yeah, don't go to that one.

1658
01:15:59,640 --> 01:16:04,680
Wait, who do you think bought up the Paulandstorm.xxx?

1659
01:16:04,680 --> 01:16:05,480
Somebody in the audience would write fucking...

1660
01:16:05,480 --> 01:16:08,040
Me? Okay, finish it.

1661
01:16:16,840 --> 01:16:17,800
Thank you to Schmanners.

1662
01:16:17,800 --> 01:16:18,680
I see you, Paul.

1663
01:16:18,680 --> 01:16:19,320
It's a race.

1664
01:16:21,560 --> 01:16:24,280
Thank you to Schmanners, our terrific opener.

1665
01:16:24,280 --> 01:16:25,640
Thank you to our dad.

1666
01:16:25,640 --> 01:16:31,240
Thanks to Amanda and just everyone

1667
01:16:31,240 --> 01:16:32,520
who made these shows possible.

1668
01:16:32,520 --> 01:16:35,480
It's been a real hoot, and I don't say that lightly.

1669
01:16:37,000 --> 01:16:39,960
That's only the third time I've heard Griffin say the word hoot.

1670
01:16:39,960 --> 01:16:42,040
Thanks to John Roderick in the long winters

1671
01:16:42,040 --> 01:16:42,840
for the use of a theme song

1672
01:16:42,840 --> 01:16:44,760
and to departure off the album, putting the days to bed.

1673
01:16:46,360 --> 01:16:48,920
Thank you, Maximum Fun, our podcast home.

1674
01:16:48,920 --> 01:16:50,440
Yes, thank you, Maximum Fun.

1675
01:16:50,440 --> 01:16:53,720
And I have the final Yahoo here.

1676
01:16:53,720 --> 01:16:56,520
I'm gonna read it now.

1677
01:16:56,520 --> 01:16:57,960
The Wi-Fi isn't working.

1678
01:16:57,960 --> 01:17:01,080
Check Paulandstorm.xxx later and see if I pulled it off.

1679
01:17:02,520 --> 01:17:03,800
This one was sent in by Seth Carlson.

1680
01:17:03,800 --> 01:17:04,840
Thank you, Seth Carlson.

Oh, a twofer.

1684
01:17:14,120 --> 01:17:17,480
Asks, how the...

1685
01:17:18,600 --> 01:17:19,880
I'm gonna add the cuss words in.

1686
01:17:21,240 --> 01:17:23,480
How the fuck did Atlantis get lost?

1687
01:17:23,480 --> 01:17:25,880
It's a fucking continent, not a dime.

1688
01:17:30,680 --> 01:17:32,440
My name is Justin McElroy.

1689
01:17:32,440 --> 01:17:33,480
I'm Travis McElroy.

I'm Griffin McElroy.

1691
01:17:34,360 --> 01:17:35,320
This has been My Brother, My Brother and Me.
