1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:30,720
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:47,280
Hello, everybody, and welcome to My Brother, My Brother, and Me,

6
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:52,000
an advice show for the modern era. I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy. Welcome

7
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:57,360
to the end of volume one. I'm your middle brother, Travis McElroy.

8
00:00:57,360 --> 00:00:58,640
I'm your sweet baby brother.

9
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:02,000
That's the sound of the cover closing on the book.

10
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:10,320
I'm your sweet baby brother, Griffin McElroy. That's the time portal, period.

11
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:11,520
That's the time portal.

12
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:13,040
Please don't look into the time portal.

13
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:18,240
Holy shit, don't look into the time portal. Because if you are looking back at yourself

14
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:22,240
from the future, total, total collapse. Total time collapse.

15
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:26,080
When you look into the time portal, sometimes the time portal looks back and says,

16
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:30,000
please stop looking in my portal. Please stop looking at me, you,

17
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,880
and then we have a full-blown TTC, and then the singularity.

18
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:39,040
Welcome to the end of My Brother, My Brother, and Me, volume one, as we like to think of it.

19
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:43,440
Wait, so the first season of My Brother, My Brother, and Me ended on episode 200.

20
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:50,960
Right, there's six seasons in a volume, and then three volumes in a book, so this is, yeah.

21
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:53,920
Okay, so we're still in book one.

22
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:56,480
Seven books in the Chronicle of Narnia.

23
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:56,800
Gotcha.

24
00:01:56,800 --> 00:02:00,320
Welcome to the Chronicles of Narnia. I'm your host, Mr. Tumnus.

25
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:01,920
I'm your host, Aslan.

26
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:07,840
I'm your host, Tummy Tumnus, his son.

27
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:09,360
His son, Tummy Tumnus.

28
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:16,320
Yeah, we've been doing this show for 298 times before this.

29
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:20,720
Is it actually more? Does that count all of them? Does that count like Totinos and-

30
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:22,480
No, I don't think it counts as a bonus episode.

31
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:24,480
We have bonus episodes.

32
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:27,680
Yeah, we've done this shit more than three hundos, but let's fake it, I guess.

33
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:33,760
We had the non-canonical ones that we had to seal away in that vault to be studied by top men.

34
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:34,720
The Elseworlds.

35
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:40,800
We had the super homophobic episodes, and we put those into the episode furnace to power our hate ship.

36
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:48,480
We had the super jugglerphobic episodes, and we sent them to the Library of Congress so they'd be kept-

37
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:49,680
Enchrined.

38
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:53,440
Enchrined in wherever truisms are kept.

39
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:57,440
Let's look, let's do a quick look backward, and then a quick look forward, because I imagine-

40
00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:00,560
And then a look down, and then a look to your left, and a look to your right.

41
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:03,040
One of these podcasts will not make it to 400.

42
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:05,440
One of these podcasts will die.

43
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:10,480
I think we should, we're gonna do a lot of celebrating in 300.

44
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:13,200
Should we? I have an idea. Do you guys want to hear the idea?

45
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:14,240
Yes.

46
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:14,720
Yeah.

47
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:21,600
Episode 300, I think we should wear some sort of leather harness.

48
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:29,360
Maybe we get back in touch with Extreme Restraints and see if they will send us some sort of leather-studded loincloth situation?

49
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:36,000
And then we record the 300 episode topless, and we just like baby oil ourselves up, up there.

50
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:40,960
And then down there, down there, it's a leather-studded sort of loincloth situation.

51
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:43,920
Up here, super duper slippery muscles.

52
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:47,280
See, Griffin, that is a complete opposite direction.

53
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:53,120
Well, you know, I'm gonna say it's more of a parallel direction I was going to go,

54
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:58,480
which I was gonna say we adopt episode 300 to 399.

55
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:02,240
The subtitle of all the episodes is Coastin to 400.

56
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:08,000
Okay, so you're sort of paving a road, a mental road out in front of us.

57
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:12,560
I can see this beautiful highway stretching, and it is a fucking easy highway.

58
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:17,440
We'll just think like the first 300 were us clicking up, you know, the roller coaster,

59
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:23,040
and then 300 to 399 is all downhill.

60
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:26,560
Well, except, well, yes, it'd be literate, like nobody would listen to that.

61
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:31,360
If we did, if we put, how did you, you paint me this picture, Travis,

62
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:34,720
of how we would spend less time working on this show.

63
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:39,680
How we would, how we would endeavor a smaller amount of effort into the creation of this podcast.

64
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:44,000
Each week, we would only publish two of the three audio tracks from each of us.

65
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:47,760
I mean, we could do this right now, because I still have a Bim Bam Portland

66
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:49,840
of our Portland live show, Elder Gods.

67
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:52,640
That's the art-seasonal, like, hipster one where it's like,

68
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:56,080
oh, I like the episodes where you can't make out anything that somebody said.

69
00:04:56,080 --> 00:05:00,720
Well, it's the one for people who hate Travis, which is there's not any of them.

70
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:01,680
There's nobody, everybody loves Travis.

71
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:03,120
Everybody loves Travis, fact.

72
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:05,280
There's fewer than there used to be.

73
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:08,720
Well, I've been campaigning pretty hard.

74
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:10,400
I've been hitting the old trail.

75
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:14,720
VR, PR, kissing all those babies and what have you.

76
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,200
Yeah, this has been two or nine episodes in pretty much the same way.

77
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:27,840
Griffin, what do you envision as sort of like, as we open up volume two of this book next week?

78
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:30,000
Don't open it yet, Travis, close it back.

79
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,040
Wait, shit, I broke it.

80
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:33,840
How do you break a book?

81
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:37,760
I broke it right in half, like an 1800 strong man.

82
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:38,260
Oh, boy.

83
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:42,960
So, how do you envision the show changing into-

84
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:46,320
More stunts, more sex, more-

85
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:47,360
More sex stunts.

86
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:48,960
More sex stunts.

87
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:52,800
Where you get your wiener out and you spin on it like a top.

88
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:54,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

89
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:56,560
And then what else?

90
00:05:57,200 --> 00:06:00,160
New friends, new Pokemon.

91
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:04,880
You'll get to learn Griffin's third evolution.

92
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:07,520
Bigger challenges, hotter-

93
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:08,320
Wetter.

94
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:12,880
Hotter summers, bigger challenges, cooler nights.

95
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:16,000
Wetter.

96
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:16,480
What's that?

97
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:17,760
Just wetter.

98
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:18,480
Just wetter.

99
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:19,200
Wetter, yeah.

100
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:19,520
Just like-

101
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:20,960
Is that what that means to you?

102
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:23,220
Wetter.

103
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:27,200
I'm gonna get stronger, I'll get stronger.

104
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:31,520
I don't know how that's gonna reflect in the show, but if I need to start going to the gym

105
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:36,720
and increase my lift weight to just keep things fresh and interesting, I can do that.

106
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:39,600
And maybe I'll just stand up once an episode and pick up a heavy thing

107
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:40,960
and that'll be a fun new bit.

108
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:42,320
New bits, definitely new bits.

109
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:46,880
What if we added a storyline, an overall arc,

110
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:50,400
where it's like maybe this episode, along with all the goofs and stuff,

111
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:54,880
you also find out that Griffin is having some trouble with a coworker.

112
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:55,920
Yeah, sure.

113
00:06:55,920 --> 00:07:00,080
And by episode 400, maybe it's a zombie thing.

114
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:09,600
Our attempt at a coherent storyline back around the Powerade days,

115
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:14,800
it was so very, very successful and entertaining that I definitely-

116
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:16,320
Well, we had that spinoff series.

117
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:18,800
I would love to return to that.

118
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:20,480
Yeah, it went so, so good.

119
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:26,160
I think all that is waiting for us and more, still waiting on a confirmation,

120
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:32,400
a dedication to the Slippery Boy record environment for episode 300.

121
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:36,000
And then we're going to make so many fun 300 jokes.

122
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,200
Oh, I see.

123
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:38,640
What did you think I was talking about?

124
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:41,920
I thought you were just pitching like a weird sex thing.

125
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:46,560
You are making a reference to the hit mind-bending film 300.

126
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:48,080
Was it mind-bending?

127
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:50,560
Well, there was a lot of weird issues.

128
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:54,720
There were people with elephant heads and monsters,

129
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:59,840
but it was also kind of real, but it was also kind of a monster thing.

130
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:04,000
And then there was, you remember the things in the movie

131
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
that were kind of real, but kind of weren't.

132
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,360
You're like, what is this history?

133
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:12,160
My only problem with this is I don't think we have baby oil here at the house.

134
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:14,560
And I'm not going to go buy baby oil

135
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:16,720
because that checkout process is going to be uncomfortable.

136
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:17,680
What do you need this for?

137
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:18,320
You have a baby?

138
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:20,080
Yes.

139
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:22,720
Especially if you just buy baby oil and nothing else.

140
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:25,680
So you clearly drove to the place

141
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:29,200
and then you just get one bottle and you put it down in front.

142
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:31,120
You don't even do self-checkout.

143
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:34,480
You go to the one person working at two o'clock in the afternoon.

144
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:36,000
You make sure they know right now.

145
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,680
So I'll probably just use Vic's vapor rub.

146
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:41,120
Perfect.

147
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:41,920
This is a-

148
00:08:41,920 --> 00:08:45,520
I'll turn the ceiling fan and the air conditioner on a full blast

149
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:48,960
and just be connected with the universe.

150
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:49,760
You know what I mean?

151
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:52,880
Be so aware, so woke, so woke.

152
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:55,440
Last week I was walking my dog in the woods

153
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:58,960
and I stumbled across a pair of very nice sunglasses.

154
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:01,760
They were simply laying by the side of the trail.

155
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:03,520
I looked around, but saw no other people.

156
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:07,200
I also did not see a dead body to whom they might belong.

157
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:08,320
Kind of a weird place to go.

158
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:11,760
I broke my sunglasses that day.

159
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:16,160
So under the assumption that fate had shown upon me, I took them.

160
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:17,840
Am I good?

161
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:20,240
That's from Polarized Peepers.

162
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:20,960
Jesus.

163
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:24,240
I would be so afraid of an Eyes of Kid Midas situation here.

164
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:25,120
Oh my God, yes.

165
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:25,680
Have you made-

166
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:26,960
How many wishes have you made?

167
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:27,460
What?

168
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:28,500
What?

169
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:30,640
Eyes of Kid Midas?

170
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:31,860
Yeah.

171
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:34,720
Sorry, I'm not familiar with Eyes of Kid Midas.

172
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:39,760
A kid finds sunglasses on a plateau in the woods

173
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:43,920
after being bullied and then finds he has like magic wishing powers

174
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:46,480
that, oh, spoiler alert, all turn out bad.

175
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:48,640
It's kind of like Hatchet, but for a boy's face.

176
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:49,140
Yes.

177
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:54,560
I can't believe the cracks in my cultural literacy begin here

178
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:56,800
and they begin with the Eyes of Kid Midas.

179
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:57,040
Yeah.

180
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:58,880
This is where I start to lose my cool.

181
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:01,680
Here's a short list of places where if you find sunglasses,

182
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:05,040
you need to return them to who they might belong to.

183
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:06,080
A, a friend's house.

184
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:08,480
You didn't find those.

185
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:13,680
You've stolen them because they were where they were.

186
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:14,880
That's just where they put them.

187
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:16,720
B, a friend's head.

188
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:20,000
Yeah, don't, yeah, now you've, that's the worst one you could have done.

189
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:22,000
A sunglasses store.

190
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,240
A sunglasses store that's shoplifting.

191
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:27,200
Again, it's not, not that big a deal.

192
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:29,760
And that's why it's C on the list, not A.

193
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:32,960
How about this?

194
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:35,440
How about a Shoney's or an Olive Garden?

195
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:36,720
You take that to the manager.

196
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:37,520
Hi, I found this.

197
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:38,560
Can I get a free breadstick?

198
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:40,640
The answer to that is yes.

199
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:42,400
We'll do that no matter what.

200
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:45,680
No matter what, regardless of the sunglasses situation.

201
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:49,200
It's not a one in one out policy.

202
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:51,280
Welcome to Fizzoli's.

203
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:52,240
I'd like some breadsticks.

204
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:54,480
That'll be six pairs of sunglasses, right?

205
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:56,800
Here's a list of-

206
00:10:56,800 --> 00:11:00,000
What if someone had brought those to like shield their eyes

207
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,920
as they, from the sauce mess.

208
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:03,280
Like just as they were plowing through piles of-

209
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:05,120
You don't want to get that shit.

210
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:05,600
Exactly.

211
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:07,840
You'll be sauce blind.

212
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:10,000
You'll go sauce blind for at least six days.

213
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,280
And then you won't be able to see sauce.

214
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:12,640
Boy, a heartbreaking thing.

215
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:14,720
Oh man, this spaghetti's wetter than I thought it would be

216
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:15,840
and more flavorful.

217
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:16,720
It's all just gray.

218
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:17,680
Okay.

219
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:23,440
List of places where, if you find sunglasses,

220
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:25,840
do not need to do anything.

221
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:28,800
A, outside anywhere.

222
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:30,880
End of list.

223
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:34,640
But Griffin, what if the question is not one of morality,

224
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:38,320
but one of hygiene or, you know, sunglass spirits?

225
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:41,040
Haunted, okay.

226
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:41,360
Yeah.

227
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:43,280
And go, so I didn't even consider that, Trav.

228
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:44,080
Haunted sunglasses.

229
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:45,280
But what if you're afraid of like sunglass mites?

230
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:46,720
Not a thing.

231
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:49,440
You just can like pop them on your face.

232
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,280
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

233
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:58,960
You basically participated in like a one person litter cleanup project.

234
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:01,600
It's like a special geocache just for you.

235
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:03,120
Exactly right.

236
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:04,160
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

237
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:07,040
You didn't know who hid it, but you do know who found it.

238
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:07,600
And it's you.

239
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:08,400
If it makes you feel any better-

240
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:11,360
You just got a saw in the ground where you found it and then walk away.

241
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:13,280
Before you pick them up, say,

242
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:14,800
hey, thanks everybody for coming out.

243
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:19,280
We hope to have a really good impact today.

244
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:21,200
And then you pick up the sunglasses and say,

245
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:22,880
well, that's going to do it for us, guys.

246
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:23,920
I think we're all pretty bushed.

247
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:27,440
Vicky brought pizza that's in her back of her truck.

248
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:28,480
It's a soda pop.

249
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:31,600
If you want some soda pop pizza that's available,

250
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:33,280
I hope you'll come out with me next time.

251
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:34,160
They're sunglasses.

252
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:36,960
Are there really any items of value out here in the forest?

253
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:38,640
I lost my clean canteen,

254
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:42,480
so everybody keep an eye out for some litter that looks like a clean canteen.

255
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:44,400
Also, it doesn't seem to be any trash cans right here.

256
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:46,240
So when you're done with that soda pop of pizza,

257
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:48,800
you can just throw the bottles just like wherever the fuck you want, man.

258
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:50,800
Whatever.

259
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:53,200
There's a lot of woods out here, so nobody will ever find it.

260
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:53,840
The fact-

261
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:56,720
Don't pollute unless you have to and then fuck it.

262
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:57,760
Because there's no trash can.

263
00:12:59,120 --> 00:12:59,680
Here's the thing.

264
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:03,200
I mean, you can take the glasses, take them, take them, take them.

265
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:07,760
If the sunlight is shining on them and you're not in a friend's house, take the glasses.

266
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:08,640
They want to be worn.

267
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:09,920
They want to protect you from that sun.

268
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:16,160
The other thing is if your glasses broke that day, this is a gift.

269
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:18,640
This is some forces come together.

270
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:19,920
Maybe it's serendipity.

271
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:21,040
Maybe it's sliding doors.

272
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:23,040
Maybe it's better off dead.

273
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:24,560
Maybe it's-

274
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:26,000
Must love dogs.

275
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:28,320
Maybe it's the Matrix trilogy.

276
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:29,040
I don't know what it is.

277
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:30,800
I don't think John Cusack's in that one.

278
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:33,040
The forces have come together.

279
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:35,360
To give you these sunglasses because they want to protect your eyes.

280
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:38,400
Because maybe in the future, we're going to need your eyes.

281
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:39,040
You know what I mean?

282
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:44,480
We're all parts of a much bigger machine.

283
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:48,480
And like a cog can't tell like, oh man, I'm inside of a gun.

284
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:49,600
They just know they're a cog.

285
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:50,640
And a gun.

286
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:52,240
You know what I mean?

287
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:52,560
Yeah.

288
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:53,040
But they are-

289
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:54,240
I do want to make this super clear.

290
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:55,760
They're definitely sentient though, right?

291
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:57,040
Like we can all agree on that.

292
00:13:57,040 --> 00:13:58,240
The cogs are all aware.

293
00:13:58,240 --> 00:13:59,120
Yes, yes, yes.

294
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:00,080
Okay, cool.

295
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:01,120
That's something to make sure.

296
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:01,920
How about a Yahoo?

297
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:03,200
I'd love that.

298
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:04,240
I'd love that.

299
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:06,240
I think that would go down real smooth.

300
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:08,640
I want to bring this one up and then we'll do another one.

301
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:10,560
Because this one's not really much of a discussion topic.

302
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:14,240
But I think, you know, celebrating the first book, the first volume.

303
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:17,200
I wanted to read this one from Ben Shreve.

304
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:20,640
It's from Yahoo Answers user question mark who asks.

305
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:25,200
Are you all aware that we are the laughing stock of the internet?

306
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:30,560
Many people take Yahoo Answers as a joke.

307
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:31,440
They're right, of course.

308
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:32,320
But it still hurts.

309
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:35,680
Oh, God.

310
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:36,640
Oh, God.

311
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:39,840
So that closes the book on Yahoo Answers.

312
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:41,840
God, we had a lot of fun out here.

313
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:44,160
Volume one is done.

314
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,120
Can I keep reading this though?

315
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:48,480
Or is the book like gone?

316
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:49,120
Do you have a different-

317
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:51,120
Yeah, I want to hear the rest of it.

318
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:51,680
Well, there's that-

319
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:52,480
Do we get a shout out?

320
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:54,080
Let me just skip to the meat.

321
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:55,120
Like, do we get a shout out?

322
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:56,560
To who?

323
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:57,520
To us.

324
00:14:57,520 --> 00:14:58,240
Like for like-

325
00:14:58,240 --> 00:14:58,880
To us.

326
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:02,960
Bringing to light the Yahoo Answers like phenomenon.

327
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:04,400
What, that they're a fucking joke?

328
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:05,840
That they're a fucking clown pit?

329
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:08,160
Like, do they use this as an example?

330
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:12,880
Like one of the most popular and arguably like the first one-

331
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:14,240
Oh, yeah.

332
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:15,920
Here it is, here it is, here it is, here it is.

333
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:18,480
Anonymous said,

334
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:22,720
Jimmy Fallon does a bit where they sing actual questions and answers from Yahoo Answers.

335
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:24,160
There are a few oddballs on here.

336
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:27,360
Wait, that's not us though, Griffin.

337
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:28,080
We're not-

338
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:28,960
Yeah, they didn't mention us.

339
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:29,920
We're not Jimmy Fallon.

340
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:31,360
And how we changed the game.

341
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:32,960
And how we actually started the game.

342
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:34,800
We are the game.

343
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:36,400
The game is named after us.

344
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:38,000
The game is inside all of us.

345
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,800
We are game, game is us.

346
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:42,640
Oh, here's one, here's one, here's one.

347
00:15:42,640 --> 00:15:42,960
Okay.

348
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:46,640
My Brother, My Brother and Me does a bit where they sing actual questions and answers from Yahoo Answers.

349
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:48,160
There are a few oddballs on here.

350
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:48,720
Now hold on.

351
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:49,520
Okay, now hold on.

352
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:51,200
I think you just read the-

353
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:55,360
I wanna be where Jimmy Fallon is.

354
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:55,680
Okay.

355
00:15:55,680 --> 00:16:00,560
I wanna see, see him play his fun games.

356
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:01,120
Because he plays a lot of fun games.

357
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:03,360
Wait, Griffin, if you're saying anymore, we have to pay Disney.

358
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:04,720
Okay, damn it.

359
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:08,080
Lots of people are arguing with this sentiment.

360
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:12,080
SportsMD, which is a fucking great username, says,

361
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:14,720
Dr. Sports is basically what this man is.

362
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:15,760
Okay, cool, moving on.

363
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:20,560
Dr. Sports says, I never seen anyone talk bad about Yahoo.

364
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:23,200
This is a respectable site where you can learn a lot from.

365
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:27,760
It's not like Facebook where you post every meal you ate or the people you slept with.

366
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:33,600
Odd dope guys had sex with Michelle last night, ate some ballin' spaghetti.

367
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:37,440
Had some amazing risotto, bone down on Tyler.

368
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:40,000
Another great night.

369
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:40,880
I had two-

370
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:44,160
See you guys in the morning when I'll have pancakes and Steven.

371
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:50,800
Y'all, I had three hot dogs for lunch.

372
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:53,280
Anyway, here's the lyrics to Mambo, number five.

373
00:16:53,280 --> 00:17:07,760
I had a little comic business, a little side business,

374
00:17:08,320 --> 00:17:12,240
selling comics at the mall from a stand with my friend Tommy.

375
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:17,360
It was one of those weekend shows where we're selling dad's old comics

376
00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:25,120
and we got a cut of money and we were next to a guy the entire weekend who sold sports cards

377
00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:36,160
and he had a linen jacket that I would pay upwards of $1,000 for this windbreaker, more accurately.

378
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:41,760
And on the back, it just said Dr. Rice and we were obsessed with him the whole time.

379
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:43,200
What could that possibly-

380
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:47,360
As we were leaving, we worked up the courage to ask,

381
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,560
so Dr. Rice, what are you a doctor in?

382
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:59,680
And he fuckin' dead-eye, straight, cold, looks us square in our young,

383
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:02,720
impressionable faces and says, sports.

384
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:05,120
Awesome.

385
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:10,960
He lived in Huntington, I'm assuming, so every time I go anywhere,

386
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:14,880
but more in some places, I keep hoping I'll see him again

387
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:20,720
and just assume that I'll run into him so I can try to buy his jacket.

388
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:22,240
You may be dead.

389
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:24,960
Even, it'll probably be cheaper then.

390
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:26,240
Well, it might be more expensive.

391
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:28,560
Maybe it's an heirloom now.

392
00:18:28,560 --> 00:18:30,320
Please, Dr. Rice was my father.

393
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:31,680
Just call me Mr. Sports.

394
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:35,360
I haven't gone to school for this shit.

395
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:37,920
I'm a fan, not an expert.

396
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:41,440
I got another Yahoo here, it was sent in by Aaron Keys or Kiss.

397
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:44,560
K-Y-S, how do you think that, Keys?

398
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:45,840
Yeah.

399
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:47,040
Thank you, Aaron.

400
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:49,040
It's by Yahoo Answers user question mark.

401
00:18:49,040 --> 00:18:51,680
Hey, is Yahoo Answers slowly being deleted off the internet

402
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:54,880
and nobody's made me aware of this fact?

403
00:18:54,880 --> 00:19:01,680
I have actually heard a BS from people in the Yahoo Answers organization

404
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:06,160
or in the Yahoo organization who think there's a possible chance.

405
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:07,920
This is on our Facebook group, we were talking about this,

406
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:10,240
that there's a chance that the Yahoo Answers

407
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:13,440
will just become vestigial and deleted.

408
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:18,800
I think it's gonna be a sad, long affair.

409
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:20,800
I think they're gonna drag this execution out.

410
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:21,760
I don't think they're gonna flip,

411
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:24,160
I don't think Melissa Mayer is gonna put her foot

412
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:28,400
on the neck of Yahoo Answers and then just execute the thing.

413
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:31,840
Will it be like that one group in Sims Online

414
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:36,400
that stood around altogether as the server was deleted around them?

415
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:38,560
Yeah, this is the death of a virtual world.

416
00:19:38,560 --> 00:19:43,200
This is like fucking the Star Wars Online apocalypse.

417
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:45,840
Like this is terrible.

418
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:47,120
And then it'll be the end of the show, right?

419
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:48,080
That's the end of Bim Bam?

420
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:51,200
Yeah, we'll have accomplished our only goal.

421
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:53,520
Yeah, to bring them down.

422
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:56,080
It took us longer than really it should have, but hey.

423
00:19:56,720 --> 00:20:00,480
Now, it will be kind of a relief to not have to go there anymore,

424
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:03,360
I'm assuming, to do something different.

425
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:05,760
Yeah, I mean, I'm not the one with the fucking waders on

426
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:07,680
just like diving into the stank anymore.

427
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:08,560
I got people for that.

428
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:10,560
Thank you, Aaron.

429
00:20:10,560 --> 00:20:12,560
It's by Yahoo Answers user Question Mark who asks,

430
00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:16,400
how to get my mom, sorry, let me try this again.

431
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:27,520
How to get me mom to buy me shorts when I haven't worn them for years.

432
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:32,320
Now, is it possible that he means,

433
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:35,680
or they mean getting their mother to buy the shorts

434
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:37,840
they already own that they haven't worn for years?

435
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:40,080
Like, hey, me mom, buy me shorts.

436
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:43,680
It'll be a fair price.

437
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:45,200
They say Dr. Rice on the butt.

438
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:45,920
Don't you want that?

439
00:20:47,040 --> 00:20:48,000
A thousand dollars.

440
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:53,600
So when I was little, I remember wearing shorts sometimes.

441
00:20:54,800 --> 00:20:56,080
They were comfortable and easy to wear.

442
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:58,000
Comfortable and easy to wear.

443
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:01,600
As I got older and into my later years in primary school,

444
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:05,680
I wore them less and less until then for some reason,

445
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:08,960
I went off them completely and ceased to own a pair

446
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:10,560
when I became like 11.

447
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:11,120
Since starting secondary school-

448
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:14,000
When I became a man and put away such childish pants.

449
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,880
Since starting secondary school, I have not worn shorts,

450
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:19,280
not even for PE or my sports clubs.

451
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:21,680
You're playing fucking jeans soccer?

452
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:22,800
What are you talking about?

453
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:26,320
All of these pinstripe dress pants.

454
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:26,720
Since then-

455
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:28,480
All of these all-time bathing suits.

456
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:31,520
Since then, I've seen other boys in shorts

457
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:34,320
and at that time sort of half-wished unconsciously

458
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:36,000
in the back of my mind sometimes.

459
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:40,320
Okay, I have to read this phrase again.

460
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:44,880
And at that time sort of half-wished unconsciously

461
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:48,640
in the back of my mind sometimes that I was wearing those shorts.

462
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:52,560
That's the least you can want to wear shorts.

463
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:53,760
What is this feeling?

464
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:56,000
What is this feeling at the back of my mind?

465
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,520
I can barely grasp.

466
00:21:57,520 --> 00:22:01,520
Aside from explicitly not wanting to wear shorts,

467
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:02,800
on the spectrum of shorts,

468
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:06,800
that emotion they just described is like the lowest one you can have.

469
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:08,320
Hey, Doug, are you okay?

470
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:09,600
Yeah, yeah, why do you ask?

471
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:12,240
I just saw a look flit across your face for a brief instant.

472
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:15,280
It was a microaggression.

473
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:16,640
It was a microexpression.

474
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:21,360
And nobody other than like your pastor that raised you

475
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:26,480
and adopted you from like a baby would be able to detect this emotion.

476
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:28,880
Like he didn't turn you into a killing machine.

477
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:29,120
Yeah.

478
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:33,360
Okay, so cargo shorts, Bermuda shorts, fleece shorts, gym shorts, etc.

479
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:36,640
Just a quick little list of what some shorts are.

480
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:40,560
However, the desire was never enough to actually even consider in my mind

481
00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:41,360
wearing them again.

482
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:43,200
This guy's got a real mind palace.

483
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,200
Got a real library in there.

484
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:49,760
What hurdle is he overcoming that the desire must be so strong

485
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:52,880
to overcome his not wearing shorts?

486
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:53,600
I gotta keep going.

487
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:54,160
I gotta keep going.

488
00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:59,520
It had sort of became hardwired in my mind that I did not like shorts,

489
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:01,600
even though when I saw other boys wearing them,

490
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:05,360
there was a few seconds where I could see myself wearing those shorts.

491
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:08,960
Thing is, it has sort of become hardwired in my parents' minds too.

492
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:12,640
As sometimes when we've been out and see a family in shorts or something,

493
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:16,720
me mom's remarked, we're not a shorts family.

494
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:22,960
Don't look at them Dylan, they're not one of us.

495
00:23:24,560 --> 00:23:29,200
My mom's remarked, we're not a shorts family or none of us like shorts.

496
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:37,200
I've seen old photos of my older brother wearing shorts

497
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:42,000
when he was about 10 to 12 years old before the boat accident.

498
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,520
No, that last part is made up.

499
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:44,960
And I know it's from his 11th birthday

500
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:47,200
because someone's forcibly ripping the shorts from him.

501
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:49,840
In recent years, however,

502
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:52,720
the desire to wear shorts has sort of slowly returned.

503
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:54,800
Okay, a little bit more.

504
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:56,160
Two updates to this question.

505
00:23:56,720 --> 00:23:58,640
I know everything about this person now.

506
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:01,200
I first started wearing them for PE again

507
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:04,000
when I borrowed some from the spare kit box.

508
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:08,000
Basically a box full of old shorts, muddy trainers, etc.

509
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:14,560
My fucking beautiful dark twisted fantasy, just a box of these forbidden small pants.

510
00:24:15,680 --> 00:24:19,360
Surely no one will notice one of these shirts gone missing.

511
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:23,200
He cracks that shit open in the fucking like Zelda discovery theme place.

512
00:24:24,160 --> 00:24:24,800
My treasure.

513
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:27,040
You've got some shorts.

514
00:24:27,040 --> 00:24:30,080
I've taken some home and me mom did discover them

515
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:31,360
and wonder how they got there.

516
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:32,960
What the fuck is this?

517
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:40,640
I learned it from watching you to discover them and wonder how they got there.

518
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:43,200
But I just said I don't know or something and hid them away.

519
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:46,800
Now you're thinking, well, why don't you just say I want to wear shorts or something?

520
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:48,240
Well, it's not so easy.

521
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:50,720
If I just said that out of the blue, she'd probably faint or something.

522
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:52,240
She'd be so shocked.

523
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:55,200
I want to try and sort of bring it up casually in a conversation,

524
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:56,400
if you know what I mean, but I don't know how.

525
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:57,360
Can anyone help me out?

526
00:24:57,360 --> 00:24:57,860
Thanks.

527
00:24:57,860 --> 00:25:05,860
Listen, this is just like any other thing that you do when you're a kid.

528
00:25:06,500 --> 00:25:09,540
You're not supposed to do and you have a secret little,

529
00:25:09,540 --> 00:25:11,380
well, you have a secret compartment.

530
00:25:11,380 --> 00:25:16,100
All you two had secret compartments where you kept your dark materials.

531
00:25:16,100 --> 00:25:19,300
And I know what both of them were because I'm a little,

532
00:25:19,300 --> 00:25:23,620
that was my sort of role in the family was a little sneak thief.

533
00:25:23,620 --> 00:25:25,220
And I would sneak in and creep in here.

534
00:25:25,220 --> 00:25:28,020
I would creep in, tap into your sin.

535
00:25:28,900 --> 00:25:32,340
That's what this person needs to get is like a little hideaway junk box

536
00:25:32,340 --> 00:25:33,380
where they keep their shorts.

537
00:25:33,380 --> 00:25:36,260
And then, I mean, you put them in your backpack.

538
00:25:36,260 --> 00:25:38,020
It'll be like the toaster strudels commercial,

539
00:25:38,020 --> 00:25:40,100
where like the mom gives them those shitty ass pop tarts.

540
00:25:40,100 --> 00:25:42,660
And then their friend Dylan is like, here's those toaster strudels.

541
00:25:42,660 --> 00:25:43,780
Hey, what do you do with your pop tarts?

542
00:25:43,780 --> 00:25:45,940
And he opens up the locker and like a million

543
00:25:45,940 --> 00:25:48,420
of the grossest looking pop tarts ever fall out.

544
00:25:48,420 --> 00:25:51,780
It's going to be like that, but with little pants without the sleeves on them.

545
00:25:51,780 --> 00:25:55,940
You need to open some kind of like big brothers, big sisters, like safe place

546
00:25:55,940 --> 00:26:00,020
where like people after 11 can go to like wear shorts.

547
00:26:00,740 --> 00:26:02,340
And like you show up in pants.

548
00:26:02,340 --> 00:26:03,140
And do whatever.

549
00:26:03,780 --> 00:26:05,620
Maybe just lay around and read a book.

550
00:26:05,620 --> 00:26:08,500
Just live their life in shorts.

551
00:26:09,300 --> 00:26:10,180
I have a name for it.

552
00:26:10,820 --> 00:26:11,060
Okay.

553
00:26:11,700 --> 00:26:12,420
Hog shorts.

554
00:26:15,140 --> 00:26:16,100
Sorry, say again?

555
00:26:16,100 --> 00:26:16,820
Hog shorts.

556
00:26:16,820 --> 00:26:18,180
It's for little short wizards.

557
00:26:18,900 --> 00:26:19,780
Okay, so.

558
00:26:19,780 --> 00:26:20,900
Hog shorts, okay.

559
00:26:20,900 --> 00:26:21,540
Okay.

560
00:26:21,540 --> 00:26:23,540
Is there a sorting shorts that you put it on?

561
00:26:23,540 --> 00:26:25,300
It's just like, there's no houses here, man.

562
00:26:25,300 --> 00:26:26,500
Just fucking kick it.

563
00:26:26,500 --> 00:26:28,020
The shorting hat.

564
00:26:28,020 --> 00:26:28,260
Okay.

565
00:26:28,260 --> 00:26:28,980
Thank you.

566
00:26:28,980 --> 00:26:32,500
When Hagrid shows up when you're 11 and your parents are trying to make you wear pants

567
00:26:32,500 --> 00:26:34,580
and you're like, no, you're a shorts boy, Harry.

568
00:26:34,580 --> 00:26:35,300
Come with me.

569
00:26:35,300 --> 00:26:36,660
You're a shorts boy, Harry.

570
00:26:36,660 --> 00:26:39,620
So there's just one house at hog shorts and it's shorts.

571
00:26:41,620 --> 00:26:46,740
No, you can separate it into like cargo, Bermuda, like tear away.

572
00:26:47,300 --> 00:26:48,020
That's fun.

573
00:26:48,020 --> 00:26:48,980
You would be, okay.

574
00:26:48,980 --> 00:26:51,780
Let's, let's real quick go around.

575
00:26:51,780 --> 00:26:52,260
I've got it.

576
00:26:52,260 --> 00:26:53,860
I've got the shorting hat in my hands right now.

577
00:26:53,860 --> 00:26:55,380
I'm about to put it on Travis's head.

578
00:26:55,380 --> 00:26:55,860
Here we go.

579
00:26:55,860 --> 00:26:56,660
Let's put it right.

580
00:26:56,660 --> 00:26:57,620
Tear away.

581
00:26:57,620 --> 00:26:57,940
Wow.

582
00:26:57,940 --> 00:26:58,340
Jesus.

583
00:26:58,340 --> 00:27:00,740
It didn't even need to like think about it at all.

584
00:27:00,740 --> 00:27:01,860
He just like knew.

585
00:27:01,860 --> 00:27:03,540
That is your own personal choice, Griffin.

586
00:27:05,460 --> 00:27:07,300
You had, you had a couple pairs of them.

587
00:27:07,860 --> 00:27:08,260
Oh yeah.

588
00:27:08,260 --> 00:27:09,300
Zipped off of the knee.

589
00:27:09,300 --> 00:27:10,980
It was the, it was like the nineties.

590
00:27:15,940 --> 00:27:16,820
Oh man.

591
00:27:16,820 --> 00:27:20,020
The cool thing to do was unzip it 70% of the way.

592
00:27:20,020 --> 00:27:23,140
So it looked like your pants were just talking and they were just saying,

593
00:27:23,140 --> 00:27:25,380
knee, knee, knee, knee, knee, knee, knee over and over.

594
00:27:25,380 --> 00:27:25,700
Yeah.

595
00:27:25,700 --> 00:27:26,820
It was pretty great.

596
00:27:26,820 --> 00:27:30,020
That was pretty good if you ever wanted to get caught on fences.

597
00:27:30,020 --> 00:27:34,820
Cause it's constantly just a constant getting caught on fence issue.

598
00:27:34,820 --> 00:27:37,220
Would George be the Slytherin of hog shorts?

599
00:27:41,940 --> 00:27:45,540
Yes, because here's the thing about the Slytherin house is that they're all evil

600
00:27:45,540 --> 00:27:47,620
fucks, but they're brilliant.

601
00:27:47,620 --> 00:27:48,260
You know what I mean?

602
00:27:48,260 --> 00:27:50,900
And I see him, I see a person wearing jorts and I go like,

603
00:27:51,460 --> 00:27:54,500
where did you get your advanced post-grad degree?

604
00:27:56,900 --> 00:27:59,220
I won't even go into defending Slytherin by the way.

605
00:27:59,220 --> 00:28:02,260
I'm I we'll talk about that on our after show.

606
00:28:02,260 --> 00:28:03,700
My brother, my brother and you.

607
00:28:03,700 --> 00:28:03,860
Yeah.

608
00:28:04,660 --> 00:28:05,380
Our after show.

609
00:28:06,180 --> 00:28:11,060
And my head cannon in the real Harry Potter house Hufflepuff was just like

610
00:28:11,780 --> 00:28:14,100
shorts require like mandatory.

611
00:28:14,100 --> 00:28:16,020
Like they were the only house that was allowed to wear shorts.

612
00:28:16,580 --> 00:28:19,220
And everybody else was wearing like cool ass robes and like, you know,

613
00:28:19,220 --> 00:28:22,900
British fancy lad long wear, but like house Hufflepuff was just like,

614
00:28:23,540 --> 00:28:24,500
yeah, whatever.

615
00:28:24,500 --> 00:28:25,300
We know what we are.

616
00:28:25,300 --> 00:28:25,940
Yeah.

617
00:28:25,940 --> 00:28:30,260
Hufflepuff just wore shorts and commemorative t-shirts from marathons.

618
00:28:30,260 --> 00:28:31,860
Their uncles didn't run.

619
00:28:31,860 --> 00:28:32,100
Yeah.

620
00:28:33,540 --> 00:28:38,100
They wore shorts and they wore old play t-shirts.

621
00:28:38,100 --> 00:28:40,340
Something tells me Dr. Rice was a Hufflepuff.

622
00:28:40,340 --> 00:28:44,180
There's something about him that rings Hufflepuff to me.

623
00:28:44,180 --> 00:28:45,300
Maybe Ravenclaw.

624
00:28:46,100 --> 00:28:48,260
Hey, I have a great idea for this person.

625
00:28:48,260 --> 00:28:51,940
Why don't they start by wearing pants and every,

626
00:28:53,700 --> 00:28:59,300
let's say two months, they cut a half inch off of the pants.

627
00:28:59,300 --> 00:29:03,220
So on their deathbed, it'll just be gone for their balls.

628
00:29:03,220 --> 00:29:04,660
Finally accrued shorts.

629
00:29:04,660 --> 00:29:09,700
Well, no, at that point it would be just like a very small necklace.

630
00:29:10,660 --> 00:29:14,900
It's just gone all the, they've just unspooled all the way up to the neck.

631
00:29:15,460 --> 00:29:18,580
Hey, here's a good idea nobody ever thinks about.

632
00:29:18,580 --> 00:29:20,500
You buy pants, you buy shorts, right?

633
00:29:20,500 --> 00:29:21,060
Yeah, yeah.

634
00:29:21,620 --> 00:29:23,460
And you buy the shorts cause they only,

635
00:29:23,460 --> 00:29:25,860
you only want them to cover half of your legs, right?

636
00:29:25,860 --> 00:29:27,060
Right, right, right.

637
00:29:27,060 --> 00:29:27,300
Yeah.

638
00:29:27,300 --> 00:29:34,900
Yeah, maybe instead of buying both pants and shorts, we should buy pants

639
00:29:36,260 --> 00:29:42,580
and then just wait for it to get to cause there.

640
00:29:43,780 --> 00:29:46,500
If you buy pants when you're four.

641
00:29:46,500 --> 00:29:48,100
This is gonna be so fucking funny.

642
00:29:49,620 --> 00:29:51,940
Wait, you buy pants when you're four.

643
00:29:51,940 --> 00:29:52,260
Okay.

644
00:29:52,260 --> 00:29:57,460
And then you get older and when you're eight and your legs are twice as long,

645
00:29:58,740 --> 00:30:01,700
you're still wearing those pants, but now they're shorts.

646
00:30:02,420 --> 00:30:06,980
So you like, they convert over time as your legs grow in length.

647
00:30:06,980 --> 00:30:08,420
Do you understand what I'm saying to you?

648
00:30:08,420 --> 00:30:08,980
I do.

649
00:30:08,980 --> 00:30:10,980
And I know what people at home are wondering.

650
00:30:10,980 --> 00:30:13,460
How do the jeans companies continue to make money?

651
00:30:13,460 --> 00:30:17,940
That's easy with the panels that you add into the pants so it fits on the waist.

652
00:30:17,940 --> 00:30:23,860
Right, and also they're like modifiable so you could get like fun characters

653
00:30:23,860 --> 00:30:28,500
from the pockets and you could have them like Velcroed on and off.

654
00:30:28,980 --> 00:30:31,700
And also some of them have drugs.

655
00:30:31,700 --> 00:30:36,100
So they're, they're working at a good profit cause the jean companies also sell drugs now.

656
00:30:36,820 --> 00:30:40,900
Wait, drugs like prescription drugs or drugs like bad, bad, bad, bad.

657
00:30:40,900 --> 00:30:44,740
Doctors, the doctors wouldn't prescribe these with their worst enemies pin.

658
00:30:44,740 --> 00:30:47,380
No, these are some hard, hard drugs.

659
00:30:47,380 --> 00:30:53,540
Hard, hard drugs that have no business at a pharmacy or anywhere in society.

660
00:30:54,420 --> 00:30:56,900
Can I hit you with an inverse idea?

661
00:30:56,900 --> 00:31:00,500
A patented Griffin flip thought.

662
00:31:01,220 --> 00:31:03,540
We're going to have more flip thoughts in volume two.

663
00:31:03,540 --> 00:31:05,140
Yeah, definitely.

664
00:31:07,140 --> 00:31:08,500
Here's my flip idea.

665
00:31:08,500 --> 00:31:16,980
Shorts you put on in the morning when it's warm that expand throughout the day.

666
00:31:17,540 --> 00:31:25,220
So at night when it's cooler, they've grown and encased over your legs and then they,

667
00:31:25,220 --> 00:31:30,100
but then they keep going and eventually they disappear right when you get into bed.

668
00:31:30,100 --> 00:31:31,460
Wait, hold on, hold on.

669
00:31:31,460 --> 00:31:37,060
Are we talking like Venetian shorts that you can unroll or like zip on shorts?

670
00:31:37,060 --> 00:31:42,340
I'm saying this is a fabric that we crush down somehow so that it's shorts length.

671
00:31:42,340 --> 00:31:47,460
And then as you go about the day doing your warm, fun shorts activities,

672
00:31:47,460 --> 00:31:53,620
then the shorts naturally heat up and in doing so it cooks the crushed fabric

673
00:31:53,620 --> 00:31:57,380
and it makes them extend and just sort of consume your legs.

674
00:31:57,380 --> 00:32:03,460
Maybe there's sort of a biophysical nanotechnological sort of thing going on in there.

675
00:32:03,460 --> 00:32:08,980
And then it keeps going and then your legs are protected from the cool moonlight

676
00:32:08,980 --> 00:32:13,060
and then you get in bed, they're gone.

677
00:32:13,860 --> 00:32:14,580
Perfect.

678
00:32:15,140 --> 00:32:19,060
What do I do in the weeks where I have to work nights at the podcast plant?

679
00:32:19,700 --> 00:32:21,220
You just are wearing pants.

680
00:32:21,220 --> 00:32:22,020
You should be wearing pants.

681
00:32:22,020 --> 00:32:24,340
You guys are wearing pants right now, right?

682
00:32:25,860 --> 00:32:29,700
Like you're not wearing shorts like just out of like respect for the process.

683
00:32:29,700 --> 00:32:33,460
The process because we're making a podcast right now.

684
00:32:33,460 --> 00:32:34,020
We're not like-

685
00:32:35,540 --> 00:32:37,380
I am wearing my work shorts.

686
00:32:37,380 --> 00:32:38,180
Important question.

687
00:32:38,180 --> 00:32:38,660
Yeah.

688
00:32:38,660 --> 00:32:39,780
Are there dress shorts?

689
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:44,100
Are there shorts you could wear to church that someone would be like, yes, yes.

690
00:32:44,100 --> 00:32:44,340
Yes.

691
00:32:44,340 --> 00:32:47,620
If you ever see Jesse Thorn wearing shorts, those are dress shorts.

692
00:32:47,620 --> 00:32:47,860
Okay.

693
00:32:47,860 --> 00:32:49,780
He makes them dress shorts by definition.

694
00:32:49,780 --> 00:32:52,260
And these are the ones you took from him from his house.

695
00:32:53,220 --> 00:32:54,420
We are different sizes.

696
00:32:54,420 --> 00:32:54,900
Thank you.

697
00:32:54,900 --> 00:32:58,260
No, these are just khaki shorts.

698
00:32:58,260 --> 00:33:00,260
How that ass look though?

699
00:33:02,260 --> 00:33:02,580
Sorry?

700
00:33:03,220 --> 00:33:09,300
How does that juicy ass look though?

701
00:33:09,300 --> 00:33:10,660
Good question.

702
00:33:10,660 --> 00:33:13,380
Like all macarons, I do not have a butt.

703
00:33:13,380 --> 00:33:14,500
There's no butt.

704
00:33:14,500 --> 00:33:15,220
Not true?

705
00:33:15,860 --> 00:33:17,380
Don't look like nothing down there.

706
00:33:17,380 --> 00:33:19,700
I'm fucking Rumpy Dumples still skin over here.

707
00:33:19,700 --> 00:33:21,460
I don't know what the fuck you're talking about.

708
00:33:21,460 --> 00:33:22,900
I didn't know about that.

709
00:33:22,900 --> 00:33:24,500
I don't want to know about that.

710
00:33:24,500 --> 00:33:27,940
Mine's just two bladed ass bones.

711
00:33:28,660 --> 00:33:29,940
That's all I've got back there.

712
00:33:29,940 --> 00:33:30,420
That's a shame.

713
00:33:31,140 --> 00:33:31,780
I didn't know that.

714
00:33:31,780 --> 00:33:35,540
I thought we were all just sort of gifted with these fucking like-

715
00:33:35,540 --> 00:33:39,300
We used to, Travis used to be called the bony butt boy.

716
00:33:39,300 --> 00:33:41,380
And you don't get a nickname like the bony-

717
00:33:41,380 --> 00:33:44,260
Till this day by passing strangers.

718
00:33:45,700 --> 00:33:48,420
You don't get a nickname like the bony butt boy without a bony butt.

719
00:33:48,420 --> 00:33:51,060
It was ironic like you call a big guy tiny.

720
00:33:52,100 --> 00:33:52,580
Right.

721
00:33:52,580 --> 00:33:56,500
I wondered why my nickname growing up was always Primo Dumper.

722
00:33:57,220 --> 00:33:58,580
Thought it was because I was regular.

723
00:33:59,140 --> 00:34:03,460
But now I've just intuited it's because I had the good butt genes by which-

724
00:34:03,460 --> 00:34:05,380
And that was a fun double entendre.

725
00:34:05,380 --> 00:34:06,980
And you can expect more of those in volume two.

726
00:34:06,980 --> 00:34:08,020
Should we go to the Money Zone?

727
00:34:08,020 --> 00:34:09,140
We're already there.

728
00:34:09,140 --> 00:34:09,940
Look around you.

729
00:34:20,180 --> 00:34:21,300
Did you expect that?

730
00:34:21,300 --> 00:34:21,780
I didn't.

731
00:34:21,780 --> 00:34:22,740
You scared me a little bit.

732
00:34:22,740 --> 00:34:24,820
I'm already there.

733
00:34:24,820 --> 00:34:27,780
I constructed around you while you talked.

734
00:34:28,580 --> 00:34:30,900
About my fucking tight awesome ass.

735
00:34:32,100 --> 00:34:35,140
I can't actually right now with any of that.

736
00:34:35,700 --> 00:34:38,580
I want to talk to you folks about Headspace.

737
00:34:39,220 --> 00:34:39,540
Okay.

738
00:34:40,740 --> 00:34:43,940
Headspace is your number one place to build mental websites.

739
00:34:44,740 --> 00:34:44,980
Yeah.

740
00:34:47,380 --> 00:34:48,500
Think it beautiful.

741
00:34:48,500 --> 00:34:49,220
Headspace.

742
00:34:49,220 --> 00:34:52,340
No Headspace is about meditation.

743
00:34:52,340 --> 00:34:54,100
Here's a kind of radical idea.

744
00:34:54,740 --> 00:35:03,540
The only way that you can intake the world around you is filtered through your mind.

745
00:35:04,100 --> 00:35:10,180
So you can't observe or take in any sensation that isn't filtered through your mind first.

746
00:35:10,180 --> 00:35:17,540
If your mind's not right and calm and cool, then it's going to throw literally everything off in

747
00:35:17,540 --> 00:35:23,540
your whole reality, like your whole existence is going to be off kilter because of this.

748
00:35:23,540 --> 00:35:26,660
But I have an answer for you.

749
00:35:26,660 --> 00:35:27,380
It's Headspace.

750
00:35:27,380 --> 00:35:28,820
It's meditation made simple.

751
00:35:28,820 --> 00:35:33,140
Guided meditations that you listen to whenever you want, wherever you want,

752
00:35:33,140 --> 00:35:34,900
right on your phone, computer or tablet.

753
00:35:35,940 --> 00:35:41,060
I've done Headspace a lot of the courses and they're really, really great.

754
00:35:41,060 --> 00:35:46,820
First off, my dude on the meditations has a great voice, Andy.

755
00:35:46,820 --> 00:35:48,020
Believe he is named.

756
00:35:48,740 --> 00:35:53,380
He doesn't, he doesn't like frequently identify himself as Andy and it's time to meditate.

757
00:35:53,380 --> 00:35:54,020
Hey, what's up?

758
00:35:54,020 --> 00:35:55,300
It's your boy Andy here.

759
00:35:55,300 --> 00:35:56,660
Hey, it's your boy Andy.

760
00:35:56,660 --> 00:35:57,780
What's got you stressed?

761
00:35:57,780 --> 00:35:58,580
Fuck that shit.

762
00:35:59,300 --> 00:36:00,660
We're going to get through this together, bro.

763
00:36:01,860 --> 00:36:03,380
Yeah, he is.

764
00:36:04,660 --> 00:36:08,660
Andy is actually a former Buddhist monk with a degree in circus arts.

765
00:36:08,660 --> 00:36:10,420
So he's like the best.

766
00:36:10,420 --> 00:36:11,220
Okay.

767
00:36:11,220 --> 00:36:13,700
Is there an option where I can just kind of hang out with him?

768
00:36:13,700 --> 00:36:18,180
Yeah, it's like hanging out with him except he's speaking directly to you.

769
00:36:18,180 --> 00:36:21,220
It's rooted in thousands of years of tradition with thousands of scientific studies that

770
00:36:21,220 --> 00:36:22,580
show its positive effects.

771
00:36:22,580 --> 00:36:25,700
If you have never tried, and I know Travis is going to back me up on this.

772
00:36:25,700 --> 00:36:29,460
If you have not tried meditation, you have to.

773
00:36:29,460 --> 00:36:33,940
It's like, it's ridiculously easy and ridiculously helpful.

774
00:36:33,940 --> 00:36:38,660
Before I started doing meditation, as I suspect many people do, think of it as like, well,

775
00:36:38,660 --> 00:36:42,340
it's got to be like heavily religious and all about like, oh, you meditate.

776
00:36:42,340 --> 00:36:42,740
No.

777
00:36:42,740 --> 00:36:47,060
Like most of the time, it's just about like, hey, chill out, breathe, like get your mind

778
00:36:47,060 --> 00:36:48,500
right, clear all that shit.

779
00:36:48,500 --> 00:36:49,220
And here's the thing.

780
00:36:49,220 --> 00:36:53,620
You might also be sitting there picturing someone like sitting on a post for like 12

781
00:36:53,620 --> 00:36:54,660
hours like meditate.

782
00:36:54,660 --> 00:37:00,420
No, this is like 10 minute sessions that can really change where you're at and really

783
00:37:00,420 --> 00:37:01,940
help you out without a big commitment.

784
00:37:02,580 --> 00:37:06,260
Speaking of the number 10, you can download the free Headspace app and begin their take

785
00:37:06,260 --> 00:37:12,020
10 program that features 10 days of guided meditation, each about 10 minutes long by

786
00:37:12,020 --> 00:37:14,260
going to headspace.com slash my brother.

787
00:37:15,140 --> 00:37:15,540
Now, I've never-

788
00:37:15,540 --> 00:37:19,380
It's a 100% free way of experiencing the benefits of meditation in your busy modern

789
00:37:19,380 --> 00:37:19,940
life.

790
00:37:19,940 --> 00:37:21,460
I've actually never meditated before.

791
00:37:22,180 --> 00:37:22,980
Seriously?

792
00:37:22,980 --> 00:37:30,500
Yeah, but I do watch the music video for the song Crazy Frog a whole lot.

793
00:37:32,580 --> 00:37:38,500
Like if the woes of the day get to me in my soul and my mind, I'll just put on Crazy

794
00:37:38,500 --> 00:37:39,060
Frog.

795
00:37:39,060 --> 00:37:42,820
Is that what am I trying to say here?

796
00:37:42,820 --> 00:37:45,700
Because this is not just one of my stupid jokes.

797
00:37:46,420 --> 00:37:47,540
I love the Crazy Frog.

798
00:37:47,540 --> 00:37:48,580
I think he's hysterical.

799
00:37:48,580 --> 00:37:52,820
Headspace.com slash my brother is the website to go forget about this.

800
00:37:54,420 --> 00:37:55,140
Ironically.

801
00:37:56,500 --> 00:37:58,180
Up next is Squarespace.

802
00:37:59,380 --> 00:38:02,660
I want you to know I am a big fan of Squarespace.

803
00:38:02,660 --> 00:38:06,180
I built the mcroyshows.com website on Squarespace.

804
00:38:06,180 --> 00:38:11,540
I just built a Squarespace for Interrobang, the new podcast that I do with my friend Tybee.

805
00:38:11,540 --> 00:38:14,260
Tell me about Interrobang, Travis.

806
00:38:14,260 --> 00:38:19,300
Well, Interrobang is a show in which Tybee and I, we address issues that are frustrating

807
00:38:19,300 --> 00:38:22,980
us in the world, that are frustrating other people in the world, and we just kind of talk

808
00:38:22,980 --> 00:38:23,380
through them.

809
00:38:23,380 --> 00:38:29,300
It's like the most open, honest, like most real Travis macro you're gonna get anywhere

810
00:38:29,300 --> 00:38:29,540
else.

811
00:38:29,540 --> 00:38:31,220
Filtered, unfiltered shit.

812
00:38:31,220 --> 00:38:32,740
Unfiltered, emotional.

813
00:38:32,740 --> 00:38:33,940
Do you guys cuss a whole lot?

814
00:38:33,940 --> 00:38:37,940
We cuss, we curse, we use blue language.

815
00:38:37,940 --> 00:38:39,940
We talk about everything.

816
00:38:40,820 --> 00:38:41,860
No holds barred.

817
00:38:41,860 --> 00:38:43,060
Everything's on the table.

818
00:38:43,060 --> 00:38:47,940
And we just launched a Patreon to encourage people to support the show.

819
00:38:48,500 --> 00:38:51,380
And so we needed a website on which to do it.

820
00:38:51,380 --> 00:38:53,700
And like we were kind of freaking out.

821
00:38:53,700 --> 00:38:59,460
I made a really solidly polished, beautiful website on Squarespace in about an hour.

822
00:38:59,460 --> 00:39:03,700
And I'm not, and not just that, I'm also like really proud of the website.

823
00:39:03,700 --> 00:39:05,540
Like I'm really proud to show it off to people.

824
00:39:05,540 --> 00:39:10,500
It's at Interrobangcast.com, took me an hour, and it does everything I need to.

825
00:39:10,500 --> 00:39:15,620
It's got an embedded podcast player, it's got links to all of our contacts, it's got

826
00:39:15,620 --> 00:39:16,580
links to everything.

827
00:39:16,580 --> 00:39:21,220
The MacroShows.com, we can update it in like the blink of an eye.

828
00:39:21,220 --> 00:39:26,660
It's really amazing how much you can do on Squarespace with absolutely no idea what you're

829
00:39:26,660 --> 00:39:27,220
doing.

830
00:39:27,220 --> 00:39:32,100
And not only that, there's so many like tutorials, they've got Squarespace help stuff.

831
00:39:32,100 --> 00:39:34,980
You can tweet at them and get a really quick response.

832
00:39:34,980 --> 00:39:36,260
It's amazing.

833
00:39:36,260 --> 00:39:37,460
I'm a big fan of it.

834
00:39:37,460 --> 00:39:38,340
I highly recommend.

835
00:39:38,340 --> 00:39:43,060
And you can start a free trial today by going to squarespace.com slash my brother.

836
00:39:43,060 --> 00:39:48,660
Dude, I guarantee if you've been thinking of like starting a website, knock it out in

837
00:39:48,660 --> 00:39:50,020
an hour on Squarespace.

838
00:39:50,020 --> 00:39:54,500
Squarespace, you should Squarespace.

839
00:39:54,500 --> 00:39:58,260
Squarespace, bang it out.

840
00:40:00,100 --> 00:40:03,460
I'm going to tell you guys about my favorite podcast about brothers.

841
00:40:04,340 --> 00:40:05,380
Hey, wait a minute.

842
00:40:05,380 --> 00:40:05,940
Hold on.

843
00:40:06,500 --> 00:40:07,540
Wait a second.

844
00:40:07,540 --> 00:40:10,100
I want to tell you about a podcast called A Brother's Quarrel.

845
00:40:10,100 --> 00:40:11,780
Now stop me if you've heard this one before.

846
00:40:11,780 --> 00:40:13,220
It has brothers in it.

847
00:40:14,900 --> 00:40:16,340
And then they talk about stuff.

848
00:40:16,900 --> 00:40:17,380
Cool, cool.

849
00:40:19,140 --> 00:40:20,100
I'm just now reading.

850
00:40:20,100 --> 00:40:21,220
Should we sue?

851
00:40:21,220 --> 00:40:21,860
What's the...

852
00:40:21,860 --> 00:40:23,620
Yeah, yeah, yeah, they're going to jail.

853
00:40:23,620 --> 00:40:27,540
Get this podcast before we get it like legally taken down.

854
00:40:27,540 --> 00:40:31,060
So let's do the advertisement first and get their money.

855
00:40:31,060 --> 00:40:32,740
And like, that's not going to help them.

856
00:40:32,740 --> 00:40:36,260
Like if we get their money, like they can't spend it on expanding their...

857
00:40:36,260 --> 00:40:37,460
Okay, all right, all right.

858
00:40:37,460 --> 00:40:38,180
Break.

859
00:40:38,180 --> 00:40:39,940
I want to tell you guys about A Brother's Quarrel.

860
00:40:39,940 --> 00:40:43,780
It's a podcast about two brothers who try to debate things, but they end up just trailing

861
00:40:43,780 --> 00:40:47,780
off and arguing about, and here's just a list of some argument topics.

862
00:40:47,780 --> 00:40:53,460
Wizard eugenics, stealing Hitler's wallet, or apolitical human skull feng shui.

863
00:40:53,460 --> 00:40:56,340
All of that sounds very good.

864
00:40:56,340 --> 00:41:00,020
I was just running that through the codex of things that we've talked about, and I think

865
00:41:00,020 --> 00:41:02,340
we are clear there.

866
00:41:02,340 --> 00:41:04,420
I don't think there's grounds for a suit there.

867
00:41:06,260 --> 00:41:11,060
Those are pretty specific topics, but A Brother's Quarrel podcast has everything you need.

868
00:41:11,060 --> 00:41:11,460
They got...

869
00:41:12,180 --> 00:41:16,100
Their tagline is two brothers, so there's one less brother than there is here.

870
00:41:16,100 --> 00:41:17,860
That's 33% worse than us.

871
00:41:19,060 --> 00:41:20,020
They only have one mic.

872
00:41:20,020 --> 00:41:24,580
We just have our own mic because we just produce sort of a smell from the face that is bad

873
00:41:24,580 --> 00:41:30,020
to be around, and they have no shame, which that one actually tracks.

874
00:41:30,020 --> 00:41:31,940
That one, they're kind of on the same page.

875
00:41:31,940 --> 00:41:38,180
It's possible that there's two brothers and they're each 50% taller than one of us, so

876
00:41:38,180 --> 00:41:41,140
the two of them together equals three brothers.

877
00:41:42,100 --> 00:41:46,900
It's also possible that there's two brothers and then one guy named Mike, and then it's

878
00:41:46,900 --> 00:41:48,660
just like a kind of a weird name for a podcast.

879
00:41:48,660 --> 00:41:52,580
I would call that two brothers, a mic, and a podcast place.

880
00:41:53,220 --> 00:41:53,620
That's good.

881
00:41:53,620 --> 00:41:55,220
That's just another thing you could have named it.

882
00:41:55,220 --> 00:42:01,140
Anyway, you can find that show, A Brother's Quarrel, on iTunes and also at ABQ Podcast

883
00:42:01,140 --> 00:42:01,780
on Twitter.

884
00:42:03,060 --> 00:42:06,100
I've got a message for Jake, and it's from Grace.

885
00:42:06,100 --> 00:42:07,140
From State Farm?

886
00:42:07,140 --> 00:42:08,980
Do you guys remember that?

887
00:42:10,820 --> 00:42:11,860
Hey, Jake.

888
00:42:11,860 --> 00:42:13,860
It's me, your girlfriend.

889
00:42:13,860 --> 00:42:15,780
It's been five years of good times.

890
00:42:15,780 --> 00:42:19,140
Thanks for being cute and sweet and funny.

891
00:42:19,140 --> 00:42:20,820
You rock that MeUndies hat.

892
00:42:21,700 --> 00:42:22,580
All right, see ya.

893
00:42:24,340 --> 00:42:25,140
That was from-

894
00:42:25,140 --> 00:42:25,620
Nice.

895
00:42:25,620 --> 00:42:29,220
That was from Jake's girlfriend, Grace, which I wanted to state again here because I made

896
00:42:29,220 --> 00:42:34,340
that terrible dumb Jake from State Farm joke, and I feel like I buried Grace's name.

897
00:42:35,700 --> 00:42:40,980
Do you guys think that you rock that MeUndies hat is like coded language for Grace wanting

898
00:42:40,980 --> 00:42:45,060
to compliment how Jake actually looks in MeUndies and just didn't want to embarrass him on the

899
00:42:45,060 --> 00:42:46,100
podcast or something?

900
00:42:46,100 --> 00:42:49,460
Your downtown situation looks good under all that MeUndies fabric.

901
00:42:50,580 --> 00:42:52,740
I feel like, well, it doesn't say where he's wearing it.

902
00:42:53,780 --> 00:42:55,460
That's a fantastic point.

903
00:42:56,260 --> 00:42:56,580
Oh.

904
00:42:57,220 --> 00:42:58,340
Like maybe it's on his dick.

905
00:42:59,060 --> 00:42:59,300
Oh.

906
00:43:01,300 --> 00:43:02,660
Did you guys see that coming?

907
00:43:02,660 --> 00:43:05,700
I thought you meant like he was balancing it on his tummy.

908
00:43:05,700 --> 00:43:08,020
Or he was sweating it on his finger like a cool kid.

909
00:43:08,580 --> 00:43:13,220
Or maybe it's passive aggressive like, hey, I really, really, really like it.

910
00:43:13,220 --> 00:43:16,340
I like how you wore that MeUndies hat to my grandmother's funeral.

911
00:43:17,940 --> 00:43:20,100
That was so tasteful and appropriate.

912
00:43:20,100 --> 00:43:20,580
All right.

913
00:43:20,580 --> 00:43:20,980
See ya.

914
00:43:22,580 --> 00:43:25,700
That's the best way to end every romantic message.

915
00:43:25,700 --> 00:43:27,300
Hey, I think you're great.

916
00:43:27,300 --> 00:43:29,300
I really, I'm really glad you're in my life.

917
00:43:29,940 --> 00:43:30,420
All right.

918
00:43:30,420 --> 00:43:30,740
See ya.

919
00:43:32,260 --> 00:43:32,900
Peace.

920
00:43:32,900 --> 00:43:34,020
Grace out.

921
00:43:34,020 --> 00:43:35,460
Sorry about your GMOS.

922
00:43:35,460 --> 00:43:36,660
Sucks, dude.

923
00:43:36,660 --> 00:43:37,140
Later.

924
00:43:40,420 --> 00:43:41,460
Welcome to Oh No!

925
00:43:41,460 --> 00:43:42,260
Ross and Carrie.

926
00:43:42,260 --> 00:43:42,740
Ross.

927
00:43:42,740 --> 00:43:43,300
Hi, Carrie.

928
00:43:43,300 --> 00:43:44,980
What do you think is creepier?

929
00:43:44,980 --> 00:43:45,460
Okay.

930
00:43:45,460 --> 00:43:48,100
You jump into a swimming pool.

931
00:43:48,100 --> 00:43:51,380
All of a sudden, the water goes away and instead of water,

932
00:43:51,380 --> 00:43:54,340
there is the bones of your dead ancestors.

933
00:43:54,340 --> 00:43:54,900
Ew.

934
00:43:54,900 --> 00:43:56,500
Or our show.

935
00:43:56,500 --> 00:44:00,020
That's pretty tough because we visited a live exorcism.

936
00:44:00,020 --> 00:44:03,780
We joined the Ordo Templi Orientis where we had to worship a naked lady.

937
00:44:03,780 --> 00:44:05,620
Oh, and we joined that Tony Olomo cult.

938
00:44:05,620 --> 00:44:06,580
They were scary.

939
00:44:06,580 --> 00:44:07,300
Super creepy.

940
00:44:07,300 --> 00:44:08,820
We joined the Ethere Society.

941
00:44:08,820 --> 00:44:11,140
We tried penis enlargement, or at least I did.

942
00:44:11,140 --> 00:44:12,660
Boy, I tried breast enlargement.

943
00:44:12,660 --> 00:44:18,580
We have basically done every creepy, weird, fringe thing except for thousands more,

944
00:44:18,580 --> 00:44:20,420
which we will get to if you listen to our show.

945
00:44:20,420 --> 00:44:23,140
I'd still say the swimming pool of my ancestors' bones.

946
00:44:23,140 --> 00:44:24,820
Well, then I don't even know if people should listen.

947
00:44:24,820 --> 00:44:25,700
I guess they shouldn't.

948
00:44:25,700 --> 00:44:29,220
But if you want to, we're at Maximum Fun and this show is called Oh No!

949
00:44:29,220 --> 00:44:30,100
Ross and Carrie.

950
00:44:33,380 --> 00:44:38,100
I recently celebrated a birthday and received a check from my grandparents who live in Delaware.

951
00:44:38,100 --> 00:44:44,180
While in my wallet, my check lost a corner and now it's compromised.

952
00:44:44,180 --> 00:44:44,820
What to do?

953
00:44:45,460 --> 00:44:52,180
Chalk it up to a $100 loss or call my G parents that I talk to maybe once a year?

954
00:44:52,900 --> 00:44:55,620
Damn, you get $100 for talking once a year?

955
00:44:57,300 --> 00:44:58,260
Wait, wait, wait.

956
00:44:58,260 --> 00:44:59,460
Are you 100 years old?

957
00:45:00,580 --> 00:45:02,420
Because that's the only way this makes sense to me.

958
00:45:03,380 --> 00:45:06,580
I'm leaning towards sending it back with a thank you card with an explanation so that

959
00:45:06,580 --> 00:45:07,860
they may avoid it.

960
00:45:07,860 --> 00:45:09,460
As well as put the ball in their court.

961
00:45:10,020 --> 00:45:10,980
Thoughts?

962
00:45:10,980 --> 00:45:13,380
You got some consequences of cutting quarters in Charleston?

963
00:45:15,620 --> 00:45:16,580
That's actually way-

964
00:45:16,580 --> 00:45:19,380
Your thing is way better than anything we could come up with.

965
00:45:21,300 --> 00:45:22,740
Of sending it back to them like,

966
00:45:22,740 --> 00:45:24,100
well, it looks like you goofed up.

967
00:45:24,100 --> 00:45:24,580
Anyway.

968
00:45:28,180 --> 00:45:28,660
Anyway.

969
00:45:32,260 --> 00:45:33,540
Pay for this to get a waste.

970
00:45:33,540 --> 00:45:34,340
Anyway.

971
00:45:34,340 --> 00:45:36,340
Yikes, yikes, yikes, yikes.

972
00:45:36,340 --> 00:45:38,660
Oops, oops, oops.

973
00:45:38,660 --> 00:45:40,820
Pretty uncomfortable, yikes.

974
00:45:41,780 --> 00:45:44,660
And also be meters running on interest.

975
00:45:45,220 --> 00:45:45,720
So.

976
00:45:55,380 --> 00:45:56,820
Make sure you avoid it.

977
00:45:56,820 --> 00:46:02,100
And my address is still the same.

978
00:46:02,100 --> 00:46:05,780
I still have the same old address.

979
00:46:08,420 --> 00:46:12,340
Thanks so much for this hypothetical money in the future.

980
00:46:12,340 --> 00:46:12,840
Great.

981
00:46:13,780 --> 00:46:16,980
Looking forward to your correspondence.

982
00:46:18,580 --> 00:46:21,620
Wait, I have a great idea.

983
00:46:22,900 --> 00:46:25,220
Same thing, sort of.

984
00:46:25,220 --> 00:46:28,020
But in the thank you note, just write,

985
00:46:29,540 --> 00:46:31,540
this gift means so much to me.

986
00:46:31,540 --> 00:46:33,460
Do you think before I cash it,

987
00:46:33,460 --> 00:46:36,580
you all could take a picture of yourselves holding it

988
00:46:36,580 --> 00:46:40,100
with kind of like a thumbs up so I can remember it forever?

989
00:46:40,100 --> 00:46:41,620
Because the bank will keep it.

990
00:46:41,620 --> 00:46:42,740
Could you take it and do that?

991
00:46:42,740 --> 00:46:44,900
And then when it's missing a quarter,

992
00:46:44,900 --> 00:46:46,420
they tell you just like, what?

993
00:46:47,620 --> 00:46:49,540
The post office did it again.

994
00:46:49,540 --> 00:46:52,180
Well, I guess avoid that and write a new one.

995
00:46:52,180 --> 00:46:54,660
What if they just mail you back the same check

996
00:46:54,660 --> 00:46:58,740
and they're like, well, here's the check.

997
00:46:58,740 --> 00:47:00,740
Check.

998
00:47:00,740 --> 00:47:03,700
Maybe you missed how this processor works.

999
00:47:05,220 --> 00:47:06,260
Wait, no, wait.

1000
00:47:06,260 --> 00:47:09,940
Mine's perfect and could still work if it's a video.

1001
00:47:10,820 --> 00:47:12,420
If it's a video instead.

1002
00:47:12,420 --> 00:47:16,100
And they say, hey, listen, Dylan is cool.

1003
00:47:16,660 --> 00:47:19,540
This is Dylan's g-pa and g-ba coming at you.

1004
00:47:19,540 --> 00:47:22,660
And you're saying if you take that video to the bank?

1005
00:47:24,820 --> 00:47:28,420
I see you furrowing your brow at that missing corner

1006
00:47:28,420 --> 00:47:30,820
before you say anything, check the iPhone.

1007
00:47:32,420 --> 00:47:34,260
Wait, hold on, let me get my email app.

1008
00:47:34,260 --> 00:47:34,980
Give me a second.

1009
00:47:35,940 --> 00:47:38,180
Sir, we can't accept this check.

1010
00:47:38,180 --> 00:47:40,180
The corner of it's gone and the check's been compromised.

1011
00:47:40,180 --> 00:47:43,060
Before, okay, now wait, before you poo poo me

1012
00:47:43,060 --> 00:47:44,900
and you rain on my whole parade,

1013
00:47:44,900 --> 00:47:48,020
I'd like to show you this video of any old man

1014
00:47:48,020 --> 00:47:50,580
that I have on my phone.

1015
00:47:50,580 --> 00:47:52,500
Note the similar nose shapes.

1016
00:47:53,380 --> 00:47:53,780
Interesting.

1017
00:47:53,780 --> 00:47:55,460
You could do it live with Skype

1018
00:47:55,460 --> 00:47:57,460
and that way you could also include,

1019
00:47:57,460 --> 00:47:59,860
they'll be so tired of you trying to help

1020
00:47:59,860 --> 00:48:02,420
your grandpa troubleshoot Skype

1021
00:48:02,420 --> 00:48:04,260
there on the lobby of the bank

1022
00:48:04,260 --> 00:48:05,940
that they'll probably just cash for you anyway.

1023
00:48:06,900 --> 00:48:09,700
How compromised is the corner of this check?

1024
00:48:10,900 --> 00:48:13,060
How much would you have to lose off a check

1025
00:48:13,060 --> 00:48:14,340
before a bank wouldn't take it anymore?

1026
00:48:14,340 --> 00:48:17,220
Okay, so it would have to be the bottom left.

1027
00:48:17,220 --> 00:48:18,900
Like lose those numbers down there.

1028
00:48:18,900 --> 00:48:21,620
So then how did that happen in your wallet?

1029
00:48:21,620 --> 00:48:22,900
It's got jelly in there.

1030
00:48:22,900 --> 00:48:23,460
Oh no.

1031
00:48:25,540 --> 00:48:27,300
Silverfish in his wallet.

1032
00:48:27,300 --> 00:48:30,740
I am kind of in an uncomfortable place

1033
00:48:30,740 --> 00:48:34,340
of thinking about how many times I did this

1034
00:48:35,460 --> 00:48:38,580
when I was younger and I hated the bank.

1035
00:48:38,580 --> 00:48:41,540
Like I got nervous to do anything involving

1036
00:48:41,540 --> 00:48:48,660
any sort of building where government happened.

1037
00:48:49,620 --> 00:48:50,900
And that was like, I was so,

1038
00:48:50,900 --> 00:48:53,220
like that's how little I knew about the whole situation

1039
00:48:53,220 --> 00:48:55,460
is that I thought the bank was government

1040
00:48:55,460 --> 00:48:56,580
and hey man, look around.

1041
00:48:56,580 --> 00:48:57,860
Pretty much man, yeah.

1042
00:48:57,860 --> 00:49:01,060
How old were you when you were going to the bank, Griffin?

1043
00:49:01,060 --> 00:49:03,060
I mean, I was like 18, 19 years old

1044
00:49:03,060 --> 00:49:05,140
and I would get like a check and I didn't have any money

1045
00:49:05,140 --> 00:49:07,300
because I was in college and I had none of the money.

1046
00:49:07,860 --> 00:49:13,300
And I would get like a $20 check from a grandparent

1047
00:49:13,300 --> 00:49:15,780
and I wouldn't like immediately rush to cash it

1048
00:49:15,780 --> 00:49:16,340
because it's $20.

1049
00:49:16,980 --> 00:49:19,220
But then when I had like negative dollars,

1050
00:49:19,220 --> 00:49:21,140
I would be like, I could use that Twonsky

1051
00:49:21,140 --> 00:49:22,900
but it's been like two months.

1052
00:49:23,460 --> 00:49:24,260
Is that still cool?

1053
00:49:24,260 --> 00:49:26,660
The health potion that you had sat on for a while

1054
00:49:26,660 --> 00:49:28,980
and now you can like pop the cork on it.

1055
00:49:28,980 --> 00:49:31,700
Yes, except it had been months

1056
00:49:31,700 --> 00:49:34,420
and then my grandma would look at her bank account

1057
00:49:34,420 --> 00:49:36,340
and be like, oh, where'd that health potion go?

1058
00:49:38,500 --> 00:49:41,620
And then she would think that like somebody is like

1059
00:49:42,580 --> 00:49:43,700
fucking robbing the blind.

1060
00:49:43,700 --> 00:49:47,620
Somebody has hacked into her bank account

1061
00:49:47,620 --> 00:49:48,900
and is robbing her.

1062
00:49:48,900 --> 00:49:52,100
That check I wrote for therapeutic socks last week bounced.

1063
00:49:52,100 --> 00:49:54,900
Huh, that's weird how that happened.

1064
00:49:54,900 --> 00:49:59,220
Well, I needed those to keep my feet, but hmm.

1065
00:49:59,220 --> 00:50:00,100
Thank you, Skylar.

1066
00:50:00,100 --> 00:50:01,940
I'll just live with the gout, I guess.

1067
00:50:01,940 --> 00:50:02,740
Thank you so much.

1068
00:50:03,540 --> 00:50:06,820
I hope you enjoyed that $20 you probably spent

1069
00:50:06,820 --> 00:50:08,580
on Doritos and spliffs.

1070
00:50:12,020 --> 00:50:13,860
Spliffs, you know, weed spliffs.

1071
00:50:13,860 --> 00:50:15,140
Yeah, spliffs.

1072
00:50:15,140 --> 00:50:17,220
I just went super hard at the gym

1073
00:50:17,220 --> 00:50:20,420
but I forgot to change a shirt since the one I worked out

1074
00:50:20,420 --> 00:50:22,820
and this is soaked in my glory sweat.

1075
00:50:22,820 --> 00:50:25,940
I'm walking out with my jacket on but nothing underneath.

1076
00:50:25,940 --> 00:50:28,660
If I still wanna go out, grab a beer and shoot pool,

1077
00:50:28,660 --> 00:50:30,020
am I good?

1078
00:50:30,020 --> 00:50:32,500
That's from Commando up top in the Commonwealth

1079
00:50:33,540 --> 00:50:36,820
and aside from turning yourself into a mini boss

1080
00:50:36,820 --> 00:50:40,660
in a brawling video game, I think that you're fun.

1081
00:50:41,540 --> 00:50:45,540
In a fucking 8-bit voice, hey man, this is our turf.

1082
00:50:47,860 --> 00:50:49,860
Duck off, pimp squig.

1083
00:50:49,860 --> 00:50:51,380
She is my girl now.

1084
00:50:52,020 --> 00:50:55,700
You'll never rescue the president's daughter from Viper.

1085
00:51:00,580 --> 00:51:02,260
Taste my steel.

1086
00:51:03,540 --> 00:51:06,740
Only now do I realize I wasted my potential.

1087
00:51:09,540 --> 00:51:10,900
I could have been a teacher.

1088
00:51:11,460 --> 00:51:12,740
Batter up.

1089
00:51:12,740 --> 00:51:14,100
And then he hits it with a pool cue.

1090
00:51:14,100 --> 00:51:15,220
Yeah, well, hold on.

1091
00:51:15,220 --> 00:51:19,460
I dropped out of nursing school.

1092
00:51:19,460 --> 00:51:23,140
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah.

1093
00:51:23,140 --> 00:51:26,420
I kidnap women because I don't love myself.

1094
00:51:26,420 --> 00:51:28,180
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah.

1095
00:51:30,100 --> 00:51:33,300
This is, I'm gonna go and give this one a hard pass.

1096
00:51:34,980 --> 00:51:35,780
Really?

1097
00:51:35,780 --> 00:51:36,580
Not that I'm passing on a question.

1098
00:51:36,580 --> 00:51:38,900
You're so permissive about literally everything.

1099
00:51:38,900 --> 00:51:40,900
I'm just passing on the situation.

1100
00:51:41,540 --> 00:51:42,420
You know what I mean?

1101
00:51:42,420 --> 00:51:47,460
Like if I saw this person out at the local pool shooting hall

1102
00:51:47,460 --> 00:51:50,980
and they rolled up like, hey, would you like to play a game?

1103
00:51:50,980 --> 00:51:53,140
I just kidnapped the president's daughter.

1104
00:51:53,140 --> 00:51:57,860
I would look at them and I would see just their chest and tummy underneath of,

1105
00:51:57,860 --> 00:52:00,980
I'm imagining a suit jacket.

1106
00:52:00,980 --> 00:52:02,260
That's probably not right, is it?

1107
00:52:02,980 --> 00:52:05,780
Yeah, since it's a jacket that zips all the way up.

1108
00:52:07,460 --> 00:52:08,900
Some suit jackets do that.

1109
00:52:08,900 --> 00:52:12,020
Yeah, okay, cool.

1110
00:52:12,820 --> 00:52:13,540
Sorry, what?

1111
00:52:14,420 --> 00:52:15,860
Like a zip up suit jacket.

1112
00:52:16,820 --> 00:52:22,660
The sensation that this person is describing of wearing a zip up jacket with no shirt,

1113
00:52:22,660 --> 00:52:27,540
I only have an association with like, I forgot that it's garbage day.

1114
00:52:27,540 --> 00:52:29,780
Yeah, you know what I mean?

1115
00:52:29,780 --> 00:52:30,980
That's the look.

1116
00:52:30,980 --> 00:52:32,180
I think that, here's the thing.

1117
00:52:32,180 --> 00:52:35,140
I have no problem with this person finishing their workout,

1118
00:52:35,140 --> 00:52:37,860
throwing just a jacket on and going home

1119
00:52:37,860 --> 00:52:42,500
because that's like a stopgap, like I had to, I couldn't just drive home.

1120
00:52:42,500 --> 00:52:45,380
Well, yeah, Travie, what's the fucking, what's the fucking alternative?

1121
00:52:45,380 --> 00:52:47,700
Oh no, I live at the gym now, dang.

1122
00:52:47,700 --> 00:52:50,420
Well, you can wear your sweaty, gross shirt home.

1123
00:52:51,460 --> 00:52:53,620
But like, I don't think you have to do that, I think you,

1124
00:52:53,620 --> 00:52:56,020
but like, as soon as you're like, and also I'm gonna stop

1125
00:52:56,020 --> 00:52:59,460
and run some errands and maybe kick back and really relax.

1126
00:52:59,460 --> 00:53:01,780
Go home, get a t-shirt and then go to the pool hall.

1127
00:53:03,380 --> 00:53:07,300
It kind of depends on what kind of a workout you had.

1128
00:53:07,300 --> 00:53:10,820
Right, because if you just did some light cardio

1129
00:53:11,460 --> 00:53:13,460
and you just did like a little bit of something,

1130
00:53:13,460 --> 00:53:16,500
something to get that blood pumping, that heart rate up,

1131
00:53:16,500 --> 00:53:19,780
and then you go home and you have a light sweat situation

1132
00:53:19,780 --> 00:53:22,500
and a little bit of stink, I think you could disguise that.

1133
00:53:22,500 --> 00:53:24,740
If you were on some dole vet shit,

1134
00:53:25,620 --> 00:53:30,180
if you were, you know, doing full cardio and strength resistance training,

1135
00:53:30,180 --> 00:53:32,980
fucking medicine balls, fucking yoga balls,

1136
00:53:32,980 --> 00:53:39,300
a fucking racquetball, spinning, and yoga laddies,

1137
00:53:39,300 --> 00:53:41,380
and you were on that dole vet shit,

1138
00:53:41,380 --> 00:53:45,380
and you have the visible stink waves coming off you,

1139
00:53:45,380 --> 00:53:47,620
you'd gotta go home and wash your body off.

1140
00:53:48,260 --> 00:53:51,620
But you don't have the stink waves of I sat around for four days,

1141
00:53:51,620 --> 00:53:55,540
you have the stink wave of I worked hard to get this beautiful.

1142
00:53:55,540 --> 00:53:57,620
Doesn't matter, Travis, that's a sour scent,

1143
00:53:57,620 --> 00:54:01,060
and I don't wanna be around it when I'm trying to shoot my billiards.

1144
00:54:01,060 --> 00:54:02,100
Travis.

1145
00:54:02,100 --> 00:54:02,980
That's fair, Griffin.

1146
00:54:02,980 --> 00:54:04,900
I didn't mean to infringe on your billiards time.

1147
00:54:04,900 --> 00:54:07,220
If they're playing billiards and every time they lean over

1148
00:54:07,220 --> 00:54:11,380
and the hoodie is no longer clinging to their sticky, stinky body,

1149
00:54:11,380 --> 00:54:15,460
and just like a little bit of that slimer ghost comes out, no!

1150
00:54:15,460 --> 00:54:16,980
Oh, oh, wait, hold on.

1151
00:54:16,980 --> 00:54:17,540
Unless.

1152
00:54:18,340 --> 00:54:18,820
Unless.

1153
00:54:18,820 --> 00:54:19,540
Unless.

1154
00:54:19,540 --> 00:54:23,700
You use the jacket as like a hustle maneuver.

1155
00:54:24,260 --> 00:54:27,060
Like someone comes over to play you and then you're like,

1156
00:54:27,060 --> 00:54:29,940
okay, well, let me just unzip my jacket.

1157
00:54:29,940 --> 00:54:33,380
And now just your bare chest is hanging out

1158
00:54:33,380 --> 00:54:36,500
as a brilliant distraction against your opponent.

1159
00:54:36,500 --> 00:54:40,100
You are going to need to time this out

1160
00:54:40,100 --> 00:54:43,780
with the money you put in the jukebox, adjust right.

1161
00:54:46,740 --> 00:54:47,940
Oh, yeah, I guess I can play.

1162
00:54:47,940 --> 00:54:50,740
Hold on, just wait like one more song.

1163
00:54:50,740 --> 00:54:51,700
And then you wait one more song.

1164
00:54:51,700 --> 00:54:52,820
Okay, I'm free now, I'm free now.

1165
00:54:52,820 --> 00:54:53,940
I'm free now, come on, let's play.

1166
00:54:53,940 --> 00:54:55,140
Rack them quick, rack them quick.

1167
00:54:55,140 --> 00:54:56,500
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

1168
00:54:56,500 --> 00:55:04,500
And Panama, zip!

1169
00:55:04,500 --> 00:55:05,540
You got to time it right though.

1170
00:55:05,540 --> 00:55:07,140
You got to make sure that your song's next

1171
00:55:07,140 --> 00:55:10,340
because the last thing you want to do is like rack them, zip!

1172
00:55:10,340 --> 00:55:13,220
Where were you when the world stopped turning?

1173
00:55:14,100 --> 00:55:15,540
That's September day.

1174
00:55:15,540 --> 00:55:16,900
Hold on, let me zip this back up.

1175
00:55:16,900 --> 00:55:18,260
Don't look, don't look, don't look.

1176
00:55:18,260 --> 00:55:18,900
You didn't see that.

1177
00:55:18,900 --> 00:55:20,100
Unrack them, unrack them.

1178
00:55:20,100 --> 00:55:21,540
That's the method of moving around.

1179
00:55:21,540 --> 00:55:22,580
Put them back, put them back.

1180
00:55:22,580 --> 00:55:24,580
Here it comes, here it comes, here it comes, here it comes, here it comes.

1181
00:55:24,580 --> 00:55:26,980
Here it comes, yeah, baby, here it comes, here it comes, zip!

1182
00:55:26,980 --> 00:55:28,980
I've seen fire and I've seen rain.

1183
00:55:28,980 --> 00:55:30,180
Fuck, come on!

1184
00:55:31,060 --> 00:55:32,580
Why is this even in the jukebox?

1185
00:55:33,300 --> 00:55:35,380
The country version of James Taylor.

1186
00:55:35,940 --> 00:55:37,940
I've seen fire and I've seen rain.

1187
00:55:39,620 --> 00:55:41,060
Hold on, no, wait.

1188
00:55:41,060 --> 00:55:44,020
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, zip!

1189
00:55:44,020 --> 00:55:47,620
Mary, did you know that your baby boy-

1190
00:55:47,620 --> 00:55:48,980
This is a Christmas song.

1191
00:55:48,980 --> 00:55:52,660
Is this a Christmas song?

1192
00:55:52,660 --> 00:55:53,860
Actually, this one's fine.

1193
00:55:53,860 --> 00:55:54,660
Actually, this one's fine.

1194
00:55:54,660 --> 00:55:55,300
Let's just do this.

1195
00:55:55,300 --> 00:55:57,140
If that plays, just do it slower.

1196
00:55:57,140 --> 00:55:59,860
And then it's like, well, guys, let's, come on.

1197
00:55:59,860 --> 00:56:00,980
Where are we going?

1198
00:56:00,980 --> 00:56:02,980
This has been my brother, my brother, and me

1199
00:56:02,980 --> 00:56:04,740
in an advice show for the modern era,

1200
00:56:04,740 --> 00:56:08,740
closing the book on volume one.

1201
00:56:08,740 --> 00:56:13,940
What changes are in store for volume two, episode 300?

1202
00:56:13,940 --> 00:56:15,140
We may never know.

1203
00:56:15,140 --> 00:56:17,540
Do we get to take a break after 300?

1204
00:56:17,540 --> 00:56:19,220
Do we get to like skip a fucking-

1205
00:56:19,220 --> 00:56:20,980
Like, have we not earned it?

1206
00:56:21,940 --> 00:56:23,060
How can we serve it?

1207
00:56:23,060 --> 00:56:26,260
Like, you can't really appreciate, you know?

1208
00:56:26,260 --> 00:56:29,060
Yeah, can't really appreciate how much-

1209
00:56:29,060 --> 00:56:30,100
Yeah.

1210
00:56:30,100 --> 00:56:30,900
You know what I mean?

1211
00:56:30,900 --> 00:56:33,460
We're like neck deep in the fucking content mill.

1212
00:56:34,180 --> 00:56:36,100
It's hard for us to like take a step back

1213
00:56:36,100 --> 00:56:39,060
and really peruse volume one, figure out what works,

1214
00:56:39,060 --> 00:56:40,260
what didn't work.

1215
00:56:40,260 --> 00:56:43,140
We should take like one, maybe two years off.

1216
00:56:44,180 --> 00:56:44,820
I like this.

1217
00:56:44,820 --> 00:56:48,500
Just like, yeah, maybe like one or two years off.

1218
00:56:49,540 --> 00:56:51,540
Okay, everybody else, not Justin and Griffin.

1219
00:56:51,540 --> 00:56:52,900
Justin and Griffin, you stay there!

1220
00:56:52,900 --> 00:56:56,020
I'm gonna keep doing the show for that one to two years,

1221
00:56:56,020 --> 00:56:57,460
but it'll just be me.

1222
00:56:57,460 --> 00:56:58,820
The show will just be called me.

1223
00:56:59,380 --> 00:57:02,980
And then we're gonna add the brothers back in slowly over time

1224
00:57:02,980 --> 00:57:04,420
and it'll be my brother and me.

1225
00:57:04,420 --> 00:57:06,100
And then we'll add in one more.

1226
00:57:06,100 --> 00:57:06,660
And then we'll just keep adding-

1227
00:57:06,660 --> 00:57:08,660
Goo Punch!

1228
00:57:08,660 --> 00:57:10,100
Hey ladies!

1229
00:57:10,100 --> 00:57:11,460
Do you guys know the show, My Brother and Me?

1230
00:57:14,660 --> 00:57:16,420
Do you guys remember the Nickelodeon show, My Brother and Me?

1231
00:57:16,420 --> 00:57:18,740
There's a great episode they did about Goo Punch.

1232
00:57:18,740 --> 00:57:24,100
I think Goo, who was a character on that show named Goo,

1233
00:57:24,100 --> 00:57:26,740
had like a soft drink that he was peddling.

1234
00:57:27,620 --> 00:57:29,380
And I also remember the little boy liked to say,

1235
00:57:29,380 --> 00:57:30,820
hanging with the big kids.

1236
00:57:30,820 --> 00:57:32,020
And that's like me now.

1237
00:57:32,020 --> 00:57:33,620
Like this podcast has given me an avenue

1238
00:57:33,620 --> 00:57:35,620
to hang with the big kids and I'm very excited about that.

1239
00:57:36,340 --> 00:57:38,420
Are we the big kids or the listeners the big kids?

1240
00:57:38,420 --> 00:57:39,780
Good question.

1241
00:57:39,780 --> 00:57:42,500
Yeah, I wanna thank John Roderick of the Long Winters

1242
00:57:42,500 --> 00:57:43,300
for the use of our theme song.

1243
00:57:43,300 --> 00:57:45,540
It's a departure off the album, putting the days to bed.

1244
00:57:45,540 --> 00:57:47,460
It's a shame we're gonna have to change it for volume two.

1245
00:57:47,460 --> 00:57:49,940
It served us well over the episodes,

1246
00:57:49,940 --> 00:57:51,060
but no, I'm just kidding.

1247
00:57:51,060 --> 00:57:53,060
It's, we got that shit for life.

1248
00:57:53,060 --> 00:57:55,780
I would like to encourage everyone to go check out

1249
00:57:55,780 --> 00:57:56,900
McElroyShows.com.

1250
00:57:56,900 --> 00:57:57,860
I mentioned it earlier.

1251
00:57:57,860 --> 00:58:01,060
It has all the McElroy podcasts and video projects

1252
00:58:01,060 --> 00:58:04,980
and all that stuff, along with like the P.O. Box addresses,

1253
00:58:05,540 --> 00:58:07,620
all the Twitter accounts, all the Facebook groups,

1254
00:58:07,620 --> 00:58:08,260
that kind of stuff.

1255
00:58:08,900 --> 00:58:11,940
And I just wanna remind everyone to go check out Interrobang.

1256
00:58:11,940 --> 00:58:14,900
You can find it Interrobangcast.com.

1257
00:58:14,900 --> 00:58:16,020
Check out the Patreon

1258
00:58:16,020 --> 00:58:18,100
and maybe consider becoming a supporter.

1259
00:58:18,100 --> 00:58:19,620
It would mean the world to me.

1260
00:58:19,620 --> 00:58:21,300
But if something else, just check out the show.

1261
00:58:22,100 --> 00:58:24,020
That is not a Max Fun product, right?

1262
00:58:24,020 --> 00:58:24,980
You're not double dipping.

1263
00:58:24,980 --> 00:58:25,700
That is correct.

1264
00:58:25,700 --> 00:58:29,460
This is a brand new show that me and my friend Tybee

1265
00:58:29,460 --> 00:58:32,180
have started unaffiliated with any network.

1266
00:58:32,980 --> 00:58:34,340
We do it because we love it

1267
00:58:34,340 --> 00:58:36,340
and because we hope that you'll love it.

1268
00:58:36,340 --> 00:58:39,380
So even if you aren't interested in becoming a patron,

1269
00:58:39,380 --> 00:58:40,820
I totally understand that.

1270
00:58:40,820 --> 00:58:42,180
But maybe give the show a listen.

1271
00:58:42,180 --> 00:58:43,140
It's on iTunes.

1272
00:58:43,140 --> 00:58:46,180
You can find it on Pocket Cast and on macroshows.com.

1273
00:58:46,180 --> 00:58:47,460
And if you just hate it,

1274
00:58:48,020 --> 00:58:49,540
then there's a bunch of other shows for you to listen to

1275
00:58:49,540 --> 00:58:50,900
on maximumfun.org.

1276
00:58:50,900 --> 00:58:53,620
Talking about shows like Stop Podcasting Yourself.

1277
00:58:53,620 --> 00:58:54,500
I said that weird.

1278
00:58:55,060 --> 00:58:55,380
Yeah.

1279
00:58:55,380 --> 00:58:57,140
Stop Podcasting Yourself.

1280
00:58:57,140 --> 00:58:58,900
I'm talking about shows like Bull's Eye.

1281
00:58:58,900 --> 00:59:01,060
Talking about shows like Lady Two Lady.

1282
00:59:01,060 --> 00:59:02,900
Talking about shows like Getting Curious.

1283
00:59:03,620 --> 00:59:04,740
We do other shows on the network

1284
00:59:04,740 --> 00:59:06,980
like The Adventure Zone, Sawbones, and Schmaners.

1285
00:59:06,980 --> 00:59:07,780
A lot of great-

1286
00:59:09,060 --> 00:59:11,540
Oh no, Ross and Carrie.

1287
00:59:11,540 --> 00:59:13,540
Oh no.

1288
00:59:13,540 --> 00:59:15,220
See, that's one worthy inflection to really-

1289
00:59:15,220 --> 00:59:16,020
It's fun, yeah.

1290
00:59:16,020 --> 00:59:18,580
What about one bad mother?

1291
00:59:18,580 --> 00:59:19,780
A lot of great shows.

1292
00:59:19,780 --> 00:59:20,660
Maximumfun.org.

1293
00:59:20,660 --> 00:59:21,140
Check it out.

1294
00:59:22,020 --> 00:59:23,940
Also, speaking of Maximum Fun,

1295
00:59:23,940 --> 00:59:25,380
we have a bunch of merch,

1296
00:59:25,380 --> 00:59:28,180

1297
00:59:28,180 --> 00:59:29,860
at maxfunstore.com.

1298
00:59:29,860 --> 00:59:33,860
I'm right now wearing my Rocket Crocodile Flophouse T-shirt.

1299
00:59:34,820 --> 00:59:35,700
It's super cool.

1300
00:59:35,700 --> 00:59:36,820
Fuck, I gotta get that.

1301
00:59:36,820 --> 00:59:37,860
Oh, it's so good.

1302
00:59:37,860 --> 00:59:39,460
And there's a really cool Sawbones T-shirt

1303
00:59:39,460 --> 00:59:40,900
that Teresa likes to rock

1304
00:59:40,900 --> 00:59:42,340
that I highly recommend for everyone.

1305
00:59:42,340 --> 00:59:43,220
So go check that out.

1306
00:59:43,940 --> 00:59:45,620
And we haven't mentioned in a while,

1307
00:59:45,620 --> 00:59:47,700
if you're looking for where to submit questions

1308
00:59:47,700 --> 00:59:48,900
and Yahoo Answers stuff,

1309
00:59:49,540 --> 00:59:52,900
mbmbam at maximumfun.org.

1310
00:59:53,540 --> 00:59:54,100
All right.

1311
00:59:54,100 --> 00:59:55,220
Finally, Yahoo.

1312
00:59:55,220 --> 00:59:56,580
It was sent in by level9000.

1313
00:59:56,580 --> 00:59:57,620
Yeah, Drew, Drew, Drew Devonport.

1314
00:59:57,620 --> 00:59:58,420
Thank you, Drew.

1315
00:59:58,420 --> 01:00:00,100
It's by Yahoo Answers user,

1316
01:00:00,100 --> 01:00:01,940
Let's Kill Hitler, who asks,

1317
01:00:03,940 --> 01:00:06,420
if celebrities were Pokemon,

1318
01:00:06,420 --> 01:00:10,660
who would you use your master ball for?

1319
01:00:10,660 --> 01:00:16,260
Oh, my name is Justin McElroy.

1320
01:00:16,260 --> 01:00:17,380
Jared Leto.

1321
01:00:17,380 --> 01:00:19,060
I'm Travis McElroy, Rob Lowe.

1322
01:00:20,580 --> 01:00:21,940
See, I can't say Carly Rae Jepsen

1323
01:00:21,940 --> 01:00:23,220
because then it sounds like I want to put her

1324
01:00:23,220 --> 01:00:25,060
in like a weird cage.

1325
01:00:25,060 --> 01:00:26,100
Too late now.

1326
01:00:26,100 --> 01:00:26,580
It's out there.

1327
01:00:26,580 --> 01:00:27,460
I'm Griffin McElroy.

1328
01:00:27,460 --> 01:00:28,660
This has been my brother, my brother and me.

1329
01:00:28,660 --> 01:00:29,540
Kiss your dad.

1330
01:00:29,540 --> 01:00:42,340

Listener supported.

1335
01:00:57,540 --> 01:00:58,180
Let's be honest.

1336
01:00:58,180 --> 01:00:59,540
We live in a world with too much media.

1337
01:00:59,540 --> 01:01:01,540
You need a podcast on the front lines,

1338
01:01:01,540 --> 01:01:03,060
figuring out what's great.

1339
01:01:03,060 --> 01:01:04,020
