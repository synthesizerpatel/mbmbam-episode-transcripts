1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,820
The McElroy brothers are not experts and their advice should never be followed

2
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:10,580
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it

3
00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:17,660
Also, this show isn't for kids which I mentioned only so the babies out there will know how cool they are for listening

4
00:00:17,660 --> 00:00:30,660
What's up, you cool, baby?

5
00:00:47,660 --> 00:00:50,060
It's better it's better with you

6
00:00:53,980 --> 00:00:55,980
It's better it's better

7
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:02,300
Better it's better

8
00:01:02,300 --> 00:01:09,500
It's better it's better with you

9
00:01:11,300 --> 00:01:17,660
Hello everybody and welcome to my brother my brother and me an advice show for the modern era

10
00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:22,380
I'm your oldest brother Justin McElroy. I'm your middlest brother big dog Travis

11
00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:29,700
McElroy, and this is your sweet baby brother Griffin McElroy eating Pizza Hut and taking ibuprofen

12
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:33,380
Ibuprofen over here in my Nike shoes and all of them are good

13
00:01:34,060 --> 00:01:38,340
You know as I sip this Folgers brand coffee. Yeah, just think about

14
00:01:38,980 --> 00:01:44,060
How lucky I am, you know, I woke up. I sat up straight up in my Casper bed this morning

15
00:01:44,060 --> 00:01:51,640
Yes, and I pushed the the bull and brand sheets away and I thought how lucky are we to get to live?

16
00:01:51,980 --> 00:01:55,820
This life, you know what I mean as I rubbed the zest soap

17
00:01:55,820 --> 00:02:00,940
All my body and got truly zestfully what flavor says what flavor is zest you rockin?

18
00:02:01,380 --> 00:02:07,060
Explosive orange. Yeah, that one's a little too intense for me. Yeah, it's got those popping bubbles in it

19
00:02:07,060 --> 00:02:12,380
Yeah, if you're a listener at home, you're probably a little bit lost here. So let me bring you in a little bit

20
00:02:13,540 --> 00:02:20,060
We were nominated by the I heart radio podcast Awards, which we instantly cared quite a bit about

21
00:02:20,060 --> 00:02:22,360
Yes, as soon as I saw my name on there

22
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:28,260
I knew it was legit for best best comedy podcast who cares but best ad read

23
00:02:28,940 --> 00:02:34,500
I when I got the news, I was eating my favorite dishes at the old spaghetti factory and

24
00:02:35,300 --> 00:02:37,300
Really savoring the good flavors in my mouth

25
00:02:37,940 --> 00:02:40,180
And I just could not believe my eyes

26
00:02:40,780 --> 00:02:46,220
This is a problem because I was actually eating at the Olive Garden when I saw it and Olive Garden

27
00:02:46,780 --> 00:02:49,220
Actually paid me to say fuck the old spaghetti

28
00:02:49,220 --> 00:02:51,700
Oh shit guys. Yeah

29
00:02:53,100 --> 00:02:57,620
Imagine a carousel. Yeah, and you're on it and it's taking you

30
00:02:58,900 --> 00:03:05,940
Spinning you wildly round and round and round and through the crowd as you spin you see the face of your grandfather

31
00:03:05,940 --> 00:03:09,280
But that can't be your grandfather. He's been

32
00:03:09,780 --> 00:03:11,780
Dead for many many years

33
00:03:11,940 --> 00:03:18,700
You continue to spin around and round and you see him and he looks at you and dead in the eyes

34
00:03:18,700 --> 00:03:23,660
And he says I forgive you and then the next one around he says

35
00:03:24,260 --> 00:03:28,940
Eat Frito-Lay brand corn chips. Oh powerful stuff now

36
00:03:28,940 --> 00:03:33,700
Is that the racist grandfather or just like your regular one? I feel like we have

37
00:03:34,980 --> 00:03:36,980
Kind of racist we can all agree

38
00:03:38,540 --> 00:03:42,660
Racist if it's not right. I don't think it's racist. It feels a little racist

39
00:03:42,660 --> 00:03:46,700
This is the kind of stuff that snagged us that nomination by the way

40
00:03:46,700 --> 00:03:52,540
Yeah, I mean remember that time when Griffin talked about how babble would help you engage in oral sex

41
00:03:52,540 --> 00:03:58,120
I want to start I want to start being in the meetings where they try to sell our show to advertisers

42
00:03:58,120 --> 00:04:00,120
I could be a real dick

43
00:04:00,140 --> 00:04:03,740
Like what you want the best of the biz you want the best of the biz?

44
00:04:03,820 --> 00:04:07,180
It's a fuck's me up. I heart radio had to have listened

45
00:04:07,740 --> 00:04:13,820
To and and Travis brings up a good point if it was the one where I talked about how babble will make you better

46
00:04:13,820 --> 00:04:15,820
oral sex

47
00:04:15,820 --> 00:04:17,820
That's crazy

48
00:04:19,020 --> 00:04:21,740
Here's what I like to think there are many let's be honest

49
00:04:21,740 --> 00:04:27,380
There are many that would not only get us not on this list. They would get us banned for these awards

50
00:04:27,380 --> 00:04:29,260
Yeah, the FCC would have some problems

51
00:04:29,260 --> 00:04:34,860
I have a theory that what happened was they put four podcasts on the list that they'd listen to and they're like

52
00:04:34,860 --> 00:04:36,860
I wish I make a five every other categories five

53
00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:40,620
Does anyone else listen any podcasts where they have funny reads and like one guy was like?

54
00:04:40,620 --> 00:04:46,780
My brother my brother me. Oh, yeah, none of us have ever listened to that show. What kind of what are their ad reads like?

55
00:04:50,300 --> 00:04:52,300
They're not dirty are they Derek

56
00:04:54,780 --> 00:04:58,220
To the point they don't like make fun of the brand or

57
00:04:58,340 --> 00:05:04,220
Talk about how like Squarespace is sounds kind of like if you said like like a circle area and that you're competing website

58
00:05:04,220 --> 00:05:11,500
No, they would never do that. All right. We got chatty broads with Becca and Jess. They're up there in the

59
00:05:12,940 --> 00:05:18,540
Fantastic advertisers. Yeah great advertisers couldn't know Brian needs a friend. Does it seem

60
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:21,660
You know

61
00:05:21,660 --> 00:05:26,660
Literally with Rob Lowe like it those two they've got their they've got Emmys and shit

62
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:32,260
Probably they got other they don't they don't need this and the I heart radio podcast awards love a story

63
00:05:32,260 --> 00:05:38,280
Yeah, yeah, they love a story and I feel like those guys don't need and Rob Lowe's thing is always like

64
00:05:39,580 --> 00:05:45,620
Squatty potty literally saved my butthole like it's like and it's always that it's like

65
00:05:45,900 --> 00:05:51,620
Pizza Hut literally tastes good the cheese in my mouth and it's like we get it dude. Hey, guess what?

66
00:05:51,620 --> 00:05:54,740
Rob Lowe has never eaten Pizza Hut. No

67
00:05:54,740 --> 00:06:05,180
Or pooped. That's the kind of real shit we bring. All the ads that motherfucker could do are like skin-tight lycra

68
00:06:05,180 --> 00:06:11,060
We all love it, but can't we all wear our exercise bike? The vegetable council would love to

69
00:06:12,620 --> 00:06:14,620
Lamborghini chafing is a big deal

70
00:06:20,620 --> 00:06:22,620
We all experience it from time to time

71
00:06:22,620 --> 00:06:24,620
Listen, we've all been there, you know

72
00:06:25,340 --> 00:06:31,300
Smartless, which is well our net Jason Bateman and Sean Hayes. This is a two-horse race. This is this is us and Jenny

73
00:06:31,300 --> 00:06:36,220
Bronson these other people cannot wait. It's not fair. Of course, they do good batteries. They're professionals

74
00:06:36,220 --> 00:06:37,860
Yeah, we're JV

75
00:06:37,860 --> 00:06:43,740
Not the JV club another great podcast the maximum fun Network, but we're the we're the you know, yeah

76
00:06:43,740 --> 00:06:47,660
Yeah, absolutely and listen all of them the the Conan O'Brien

77
00:06:47,660 --> 00:06:52,180
Smartless literally, I'm pretty sure they're nominated for other categories, right?

78
00:06:52,180 --> 00:06:57,220
So this is this is the like, you know, the the best sound editing which don't get me wrong

79
00:06:57,220 --> 00:07:00,900
So anything's very important, but this is where our movies gonna win, right?

80
00:07:00,900 --> 00:07:07,260
Like sure we can put on the box of an I heart radio podcast award-winning podcast, right?

81
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:14,380
I mean, I feel like they're pull they're trying to pull like if we give it to smartless. Do we get

82
00:07:14,380 --> 00:07:18,780
Are these guys at the award? Oh, right, right. Oh, yeah, I get that

83
00:07:19,580 --> 00:07:26,160
Can we get these guys if they're there, you know, if we if they win certainly sir. Yeah, they'll be there

84
00:07:26,300 --> 00:07:32,220
We're bones dudes. Yeah, we're both. Yeah, they'll probably just give us the best comedy one. Oh

85
00:07:33,100 --> 00:07:34,860
Damn, I know

86
00:07:34,860 --> 00:07:38,700
Damn, that's smartless. I was kind of thinking that they would do like

87
00:07:38,700 --> 00:07:46,260
You know, a lot of these are like 12 episodes. They're out there every week. Yeah, I'm putting in the work, you know

88
00:07:46,260 --> 00:07:49,260
I know. I mean shout shout out to them. They're consistent

89
00:07:49,980 --> 00:07:51,980
especially for people who have things

90
00:07:51,980 --> 00:07:58,780
Things going on lots of other things. Yeah of our two shows one of us has a Ozark guy in it

91
00:07:58,780 --> 00:08:02,540
That should be that's true. And it's true. It's not

92
00:08:02,540 --> 00:08:06,820
I'm not on the I'm not on those arcs. I was actually edited out

93
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:11,780
I was but I was supposed to have a four episode arc and they cut me out of all four

94
00:08:11,780 --> 00:08:14,860
I was mr. I was mr. Drugs. You remember that character I do

95
00:08:15,140 --> 00:08:20,580
Yeah, I was like Billy the former mayor and much-beloved figure around town. Then they see

96
00:08:21,220 --> 00:08:23,220
It I did it

97
00:08:23,300 --> 00:08:25,300
And I don't know

98
00:08:26,460 --> 00:08:28,460
Yeah flip it off though

99
00:08:28,460 --> 00:08:31,960
They sold smartless to Amazon

100
00:08:32,940 --> 00:08:34,940
We're fucking ride or die

101
00:08:36,260 --> 00:08:41,380
They love that story. Yeah in these chatty broads is Indy too. Damn it. It's okay

102
00:08:43,100 --> 00:08:45,100
Yeah, we're not entirely

103
00:08:46,580 --> 00:08:52,240
On the show. Yeah, it's already any point be like you're out carrot top French Stewart

104
00:08:52,240 --> 00:09:00,520
Kelsey grammar, you're the new snort. Well, hey look at that. Hey I heart right now Amazon could go to them and say you have to do

105
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:02,160
advertisements for

106
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:05,880
You know racist brand chips and they have to do it. They have

107
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:09,840
We don't we don't we do whatever we want

108
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:14,880
What we want to do is help you our listening audience. It's an honor to be nominated

109
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:20,500
Can we say that but you don't win? I'm gonna throw a thermonuclear piss fit like

110
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:21,540
Yeah

111
00:09:21,540 --> 00:09:26,300
Absolutely gonna lose. I I also just want to say hey I heart radio. Thank you so much

112
00:09:26,300 --> 00:09:28,820
Very flattered that you put us in best comedy podcast

113
00:09:28,820 --> 00:09:31,940
I do like that we're up there in best comedy and down at the bottom

114
00:09:31,940 --> 00:09:38,700
It's like podcast to watch films to be buried with with Brett Goldstein one of the most famous people on the planet right now

115
00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:46,320
Brett Goldstein watch. Hey us three established fellows are gonna tell you watch that young whippersnapper of Brett Goldstein

116
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:53,240
He's going places. Let me do this. Let me do this cuz we got a lot of famos. Yeah in our category for best ad read

117
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:55,480
Let me do this. Let me say

118
00:09:56,600 --> 00:10:03,280
Congratulations huge congratulations to chatty broads with Becca and Jess. Yes huge congratulations to Conan

119
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:10,940
Oh Brian needs a friend so happy to be nominated with literally with Rob Lowe and and congratulations to smartless now if any of those shows

120
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:13,640
Don't mention our show by name

121
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:19,640
Stop their bad sport. Yes. Yes. Now the ball's in their court. That's a good sport

122
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:26,680
Sean I know you're listening just it. Hey one Justin tuna Jason you get the idea

123
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:35,800
And I heart radio one other thing to consider is that our daddy gave you the best years of his life the best years

124
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:36,600
of his life

125
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:39,240
You also do I want to highlight though that it is

126
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:46,540
91 days away until the podcast award and the chance that I will remember this in 90 days. Yeah, very slight unless that

127
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:52,000
Until the Hardy shows up in your mailbox. Oh, absolutely. I just assumed we get an invite

128
00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:56,700
They're not gonna make if we will well, that'll be a good indication. Oh, that'll be a great

129
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:03,280
Is to be there no, I mean you can come if you want

130
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:05,960
You might make mr. Bate would

131
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:10,940
Oh, we can just cut to some cardboard cutouts. It's fine

132
00:11:13,180 --> 00:11:19,060
Wait, yeah, I want to send him a picture of myself for the cardboard cutout and it's me like nodding understandably

133
00:11:21,060 --> 00:11:23,540
That makes sense. Yeah. Oh I get it

134
00:11:25,260 --> 00:11:29,980
Okay, I get it. Hey, we got a strong crop of questions. Yeah, let's get busy

135
00:11:31,300 --> 00:11:34,020
Today's the birthday of my roommate unlikely

136
00:11:34,020 --> 00:11:35,100
exactly

137
00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:36,780
considering that

138
00:11:36,780 --> 00:11:42,540
You know, we're reading it whenever they have no control over the temperature of this but perhaps when it was written

139
00:11:42,540 --> 00:11:45,000
I have to assume that's it Justin

140
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:49,540
I don't think this was a moving target thing trying to time it out who is a good friend of mine good

141
00:11:49,540 --> 00:11:56,060
I do not usually make things but this year I got some help from my girlfriend and made a homemade pumpkin pie from scratch

142
00:11:56,500 --> 00:11:57,740
nummy

143
00:11:57,740 --> 00:11:59,300
nummy numbers

144
00:11:59,300 --> 00:12:02,160
It's the right season for that. You don't want to make that in like May

145
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:07,540
Yeah, even pureed the pumpkin ourselves rookie mistake, but okay. Yeah, you can buy that you can just buy that

146
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:09,360
Don't don't waste your time

147
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:12,060
Don't make anything. Yeah, just buy a pumpkin pie

148
00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:20,120
Roommate was grateful for the pie, but after a quiet night without any birthday festivities. She has not yet eaten any of the pie. Okay

149
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:22,800
I'm a selfish man

150
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:26,280
homemade pie something that my heart and my tummy greatly desires

151
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:32,600
How do I get them to eat some of this pie so that I can have some that's from pie problems in Portland

152
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:36,360
That's a topic. Let me just start off by letting you off the hook a little bit

153
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:40,280
You may have homemade pie from scratch. You're not selfish. You're human

154
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:45,080
If you're human of your time, you've seen that pies that you put the hard work into that pie, right?

155
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:49,920
You did a little bit of the little red hen who will help me plant the wheat who will help me harvest the wheat

156
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:55,640
Right, you made the pie and now you're looking at that pie and you want to have a little flizzy for your work

157
00:12:55,640 --> 00:12:58,960
I get it. Yeah, there's nothing wrong with that at all

158
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:03,040
Let me say this. Yeah, if you're listening to this on

159
00:13:04,420 --> 00:13:10,520
Monday the 18th. Yeah of October don't eat them. Don't eat the part

160
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:13,360
Okay, it's too late. Oh

161
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:18,880
You miss their chance so I can help in that sense. Don't eat don't need the pie. Let me tell you

162
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:21,200
Here's the secret, right? I've I figured this out

163
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:26,280
When there is any kind of birthday thing you bake a thing you make a thing whatever, right?

164
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:30,640
Yeah, shake a thing you shake a thing you take a thing you like a thing you

165
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:36,640
Everybody like Bella thing everybody's waiting for the first cut. Yeah, right

166
00:13:37,880 --> 00:13:39,800
You have to

167
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:41,800
Justin you okay? I just

168
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:46,880
Yeah, I had to stand up. Okay, so I had to stand up cuz like

169
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:52,160
Go ahead. Try us you fishy. Well, you got to make the first cut right? And so I make the first you gotta make the

170
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:58,480
First cut and so at some point you just have to start slicing things up and putting them on plates and saying who wants it

171
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:04,420
Right, because otherwise everybody's waiting for when is it time for it? I don't want to be the person who asked for it

172
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,200
You just got you just gotta start serving it

173
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:12,060
They should they should make pie molds that look like a slice is already missing

174
00:14:12,060 --> 00:14:17,020
Yeah bait when you make it and so people just assume like it's go time also

175
00:14:17,020 --> 00:14:18,340
Do you have whipped cream there?

176
00:14:18,340 --> 00:14:24,900
Cuz if there's if there's pumpkin to kinder pie that person is waiting for the whipping cream to go with I saw one on America's

177
00:14:24,900 --> 00:14:27,740
Test kitchen, you know what they did last night. It's actually Cook's Country. What's the difference?

178
00:14:27,740 --> 00:14:32,300
They put some melted milk powder into their whipped cream. Oh, yes

179
00:14:32,820 --> 00:14:36,620
Hey you question asker you fucked up

180
00:14:36,620 --> 00:14:43,660
You fucked up you can't put this kind of baked good pressure on somebody that lives with you

181
00:14:43,660 --> 00:14:47,060
Yeah, because you need to be able okay. Here's the way

182
00:14:47,060 --> 00:14:53,260
Here's the way baked good baked goods gift if you give someone a baked good, right and you say please enjoy they say

183
00:14:53,260 --> 00:14:55,100
Oh, thank you

184
00:14:55,100 --> 00:14:59,940
Thank you. I'm gonna take this. Hope a week later. They bring you back a cleaned

185
00:14:59,940 --> 00:15:07,580
High plate they say thank you. It was delicious, right your heart in your head say they ate the whole thing

186
00:15:07,860 --> 00:15:09,860
Maybe even in one sitting

187
00:15:09,900 --> 00:15:14,060
Maybe one sitting they loved it so much couldn't put it down. They did not

188
00:15:14,780 --> 00:15:19,940
Fold up a business card and shovel two-thirds of it into the trash can right that didn't happen

189
00:15:20,220 --> 00:15:24,940
They ate as much as they wanted and that might have been almost none

190
00:15:24,940 --> 00:15:31,380
Right, but you now have put them in the situation where every bite every nibble is

191
00:15:32,220 --> 00:15:36,060
Going to be under your watchful. Eye. What if they cut a slice? Uh-huh

192
00:15:36,740 --> 00:15:40,740
While you're just trying to enjoy TV together. You're just trying to watch

193
00:15:41,460 --> 00:15:43,460
Survivor together they cut a slice

194
00:15:43,900 --> 00:15:50,020
They know that they are now going to consume this pie under the watchful eye of Sauron

195
00:15:50,020 --> 00:15:57,140
Yeah, you're gonna be every move every micro micro taste every micro machine every micro. No, there's no micro machine

196
00:15:57,140 --> 00:15:58,980
Well, they don't know here's the thing Justin

197
00:15:58,980 --> 00:16:03,900
It's even worse than that because if you're good friends with a roommate, they know you don't normally bake things

198
00:16:03,900 --> 00:16:04,660
Oh, yeah

199
00:16:04,660 --> 00:16:12,540
The pressure's so on and they watch you maybe like puree it yourself or you said like you're in the world and they're like

200
00:16:13,180 --> 00:16:17,260
Have you ever pure it there in their head? They're thinking have I ever seen them puree anything before?

201
00:16:17,260 --> 00:16:21,180
Do they know if it was done? How did that happen to you? What was that?

202
00:16:21,180 --> 00:16:25,300
That was just my chair pushing my chair all the way. I decided I'm not gonna need it this whole episode. Listen

203
00:16:25,580 --> 00:16:31,840
It's too much when you do everything yourself from scratch. There's so much room for error. Did you leave?

204
00:16:32,020 --> 00:16:35,980
Did you leave a mess? Yeah, did you leave a mess?

205
00:16:36,180 --> 00:16:40,140
Because I wouldn't be happy to get the pie that did the mess that broke my heart

206
00:16:41,380 --> 00:16:45,380
For sure for sure. I would say 48 hours have passed you can just cut into it

207
00:16:45,380 --> 00:16:51,740
I think you can go nuts after I think after 30 you have you have to ask it's insane

208
00:16:51,740 --> 00:16:54,260
Not to think about the flipside of this question if we received it

209
00:16:54,260 --> 00:16:58,840
It was like my roommate baked me a pie and it was really sweet and then they cut into that motherfucker

210
00:16:58,940 --> 00:17:01,680
Like I was saving it to show my mom on FaceTime

211
00:17:02,140 --> 00:17:05,820
Yeah, and she's been in Bermuda this whole time. And so I had to wait

212
00:17:05,820 --> 00:17:08,820
There is a massive difference between a pie with a tiny

213
00:17:08,820 --> 00:17:15,900
Half inch slice out of it and a pie that is untouched pie that is untouched you could take to a bake sale

214
00:17:15,900 --> 00:17:20,660
yeah, you could take to the a pie that is untouched has has value you could take it to a

215
00:17:21,820 --> 00:17:23,820
Pawn shop. Oh

216
00:17:23,900 --> 00:17:29,780
Aftermarket the pie aftermarket is very very lucrative right now. Yeah, you have there's a market for that

217
00:17:29,780 --> 00:17:31,780
You could take it to someone else's house and be like, I

218
00:17:32,820 --> 00:17:36,860
Made pie. I mean, you know the pie things that people say cool. Yeah, that is happening

219
00:17:36,860 --> 00:17:41,980
by the way, the big good the second hand big good has happened to me many times where it's like, oh, yeah, my

220
00:17:42,540 --> 00:17:48,580
In-laws gave this to me, but they gave me too much. So now I'm giving it to you and it's like

221
00:17:48,580 --> 00:17:50,300
Oh, I'm not gonna eat that

222
00:17:50,300 --> 00:17:55,300
Like there's just something about that where like I know at this point like oh, I'm really appreciative of this

223
00:17:55,380 --> 00:17:59,580
It's gonna sit on the counter for X number of days before I go

224
00:17:59,580 --> 00:18:02,300
Ah, man, I should have eaten that and then I'm gonna throw it away

225
00:18:02,300 --> 00:18:07,300
Like there's something about the disconnect where it just fades from my memory like Brigadoon

226
00:18:07,420 --> 00:18:13,660
Yeah, my trick my trick is I'll bake something really delicious cuz you know me that's a good trick, you know me

227
00:18:13,660 --> 00:18:18,020
I'll bring I make something really delicious. I'll try a slice. I'm like, this is really good

228
00:18:18,020 --> 00:18:21,620
And if I have this in the house, I'm gonna eat this whole fucking thing. Yeah, it's so good

229
00:18:21,660 --> 00:18:26,580
So then I'll take it over to Sydney's parents house. I'll say hey time at this point

230
00:18:26,580 --> 00:18:29,420
You got a Mary and Tommy's I think everyone marry Tommy's house in

231
00:18:29,420 --> 00:18:33,220
It's like Tommy. You gotta try this pumpkin cake and then I'll just like

232
00:18:34,460 --> 00:18:39,820
Accidentally leave it there. Yeah, knowing full well that he'll consume the entire thing for breakfast

233
00:18:39,820 --> 00:18:43,980
So I'm basically using my father-in-law as a more ethical garbage can

234
00:18:43,980 --> 00:18:49,460
There you go using his body like a like a more ethical trash can that makes me feel good cuz it nourished

235
00:18:49,460 --> 00:18:51,620
You know what? I mean it nourished somebody

236
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:56,700
Do you ever think that this is what how when you go to like the supermarket?

237
00:18:56,700 --> 00:19:00,260
And you see they're selling like a half pie and that like half pie container

238
00:19:00,460 --> 00:19:06,460
that like the person baked it in the grocery store and they went I can have a little piece and pretty soon half the

239
00:19:06,460 --> 00:19:08,460
Pie was gone and they were like, oh no

240
00:19:08,860 --> 00:19:16,020
And they had to build a special container to just sell half a pie and it just kept happening because damn those pies look good

241
00:19:16,020 --> 00:19:21,740
They do look good though. I you know, he gets the time he gets the little guy pies, you know

242
00:19:21,740 --> 00:19:28,820
Tommy does Tommy gets the little guy. He goes to Walmart. He gets a little guy pie and it's a personal, you know

243
00:19:28,820 --> 00:19:33,880
I've heard pot, you know personal pie pie a personal pie a little guy pie

244
00:19:34,580 --> 00:19:36,180
Hey

245
00:19:36,180 --> 00:19:40,740
Do you guys want to approach the Wizards Throne? We talking wait, is he in it?

246
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:48,100
Yeah, were you guys tracking how long we just talked about pie because it was it was a big it was a big pie talk

247
00:19:48,100 --> 00:19:53,180
You know, it's a great question. Hurry up. You could do a pie chart of how much time we spent talking about pie

248
00:19:53,180 --> 00:19:59,020
That's funny Marlena sent this one in and it's just like a it's I wish I had this one when kovats started

249
00:19:59,020 --> 00:20:02,780
Cuz I don't know about you guys, but I got pretty fucking bored. Oh, yeah

250
00:20:03,460 --> 00:20:07,740
During kovat stuff like starting like like it's hard for me to remember what things were like back then

251
00:20:07,740 --> 00:20:11,660
Yeah, it's kovats. They were it's wicked a lot like how it is

252
00:20:12,660 --> 00:20:14,900
Presently this feels that way sometimes to them

253
00:20:14,900 --> 00:20:19,980
Yeah, I'll like all the time but it's okay because now we're gonna teach you how to pass time

254
00:20:20,660 --> 00:20:26,420
This one was co-authored. I didn't know that this was something you had to actively do. I have this explains so much

255
00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:33,380
Yeah, you have to really force your body to move forward through the time stream. Yeah, it was co-authored by Lucy

256
00:20:33,380 --> 00:20:37,780
Yeah, so let's get into it. There's so much stuff here guys

257
00:20:38,740 --> 00:20:40,740
method one doing stuff

258
00:20:40,740 --> 00:20:46,260
Oh awesome so far. That's that's pretty brassy to put that out number one. Yeah

259
00:20:47,300 --> 00:20:52,860
Stuff is a big that's a big the big hit open with number two not doing stuff

260
00:20:52,940 --> 00:20:57,860
Yeah, so the first the very first thing you need to pass the time why not dance around?

261
00:20:58,380 --> 00:21:00,180
Have a dance party just for yourself

262
00:21:00,180 --> 00:21:06,300
if you're in a place where you can't dance choreograph a dance inside your head to your favorite song and I know that Ellen's

263
00:21:06,300 --> 00:21:11,820
in hot water, but I for her whole thing, but I bet you

264
00:21:12,420 --> 00:21:15,900
That she's kind of stoked to not have to do that show anymore

265
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:18,740
Cuz now she can just like when the spirit moves her

266
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:22,380
She doesn't have to wait to be in front of an audience and just have a little dance

267
00:21:22,740 --> 00:21:25,540
Yeah, why would I want to dance if no one is watching?

268
00:21:26,260 --> 00:21:28,260
Yes, exactly

269
00:21:28,260 --> 00:21:29,380
I

270
00:21:29,380 --> 00:21:33,740
Think choreographing a dance in your head to entertain yourself. Yeah, I mean

271
00:21:33,740 --> 00:21:35,740
I

272
00:21:35,820 --> 00:21:40,260
Was gonna say that's pretty wild I guess that's how choreographers do it right? Yeah, that's true

273
00:21:40,260 --> 00:21:44,260
That's I know if you have a gift or not until you start choreographing things in your brain

274
00:21:44,580 --> 00:21:51,500
Yeah, Travis wall one day was just like waiting in a long line at Target. He was like, ooh, actually that would look fucking cool

275
00:21:54,460 --> 00:21:57,820
Watch me do this and tell me if it looks good cuz I can't see myself from here

276
00:21:57,820 --> 00:22:00,660
Oh, no, no Travis Travis. Sorry Travis wall can't dance

277
00:22:00,660 --> 00:22:04,980
He just does the the dance moves in his brain, you know

278
00:22:06,620 --> 00:22:09,860
He just makes the brain dancers in his dreamscape dance

279
00:22:09,940 --> 00:22:13,700
But when he tries to do him with his body and it's frustrating because when he's showing something he's like, all right

280
00:22:13,700 --> 00:22:19,300
So you want to twist your arms like then and do him like this and people like Travis you need to stop pal

281
00:22:19,980 --> 00:22:23,060
I organize your movie shelf that we all have

282
00:22:23,700 --> 00:22:28,540
Oh now this is good because a lot of people talk about do you do by genre do you do it?

283
00:22:28,540 --> 00:22:33,620
You know by director by year. No by color. Oh, that's one of the yeah

284
00:22:33,620 --> 00:22:35,820
That's one of the options here traps the spine color

285
00:22:35,820 --> 00:22:40,980
It's great. If you don't have any movies nearby just rank your favorite movies in your head or read books

286
00:22:41,320 --> 00:22:43,320
Hey, you can't wait

287
00:22:44,420 --> 00:22:48,780
One of the oldest ways to pass time in the history of exist

288
00:22:49,180 --> 00:22:56,580
like humanity has been killing time by looking at ink on paper for thousands of years and you

289
00:22:56,580 --> 00:23:02,700
Get in with that movie shelf that you throw that in underneath. Oh you'd organize your movies, I guess

290
00:23:02,700 --> 00:23:08,700
Yeah, and then I'll skip that like I'm not gonna read that that's wild and then they slip in there, you know

291
00:23:09,700 --> 00:23:11,700
No, read books. Yeah, you could

292
00:23:12,420 --> 00:23:17,420
Escape into the wonderful world of literature that could take you anywhere as long as your mind is willing to accept it

293
00:23:17,420 --> 00:23:23,020
Or you could figure out the right order from Pixar movies. Yeah, it's so mad at my

294
00:23:23,020 --> 00:23:28,180
At my ownership of any physical. Oh sure. Yeah, I haven't bought a movie

295
00:23:28,540 --> 00:23:33,380
Comprehend. Yeah, can't comprehend haven't bought a physical movie or book for that matter

296
00:23:33,380 --> 00:23:38,380
I think unless it's a reference book. I don't buy a lot of them, but I'll begin from get put them away

297
00:23:38,380 --> 00:23:42,500
I don't know when I want to watch season three of Penn and Teller's bullshit. I don't know. It's true

298
00:23:42,500 --> 00:23:43,180
No

299
00:23:43,180 --> 00:23:48,220
Could be any time I do like to have them for when people come over and I say look at that

300
00:23:48,220 --> 00:23:53,980
That's a thing. Look at it. That's my almost complete box set of lost

301
00:23:53,980 --> 00:23:58,300
I am missing a few discs from I loaned them to my friend Jeremy, and I'm never getting

302
00:23:59,860 --> 00:24:05,500
Write a song. All right, sorry, but whatever make up your own language. She be booby-dooby-gooby

303
00:24:05,980 --> 00:24:09,140
Love it. Good. We love it. You call me

304
00:24:09,140 --> 00:24:16,700
I called you a scooby-dooby-dooby-dooby and that's my language how is take a nap not number one. That's the number

305
00:24:16,700 --> 00:24:20,620
I've got time to kill. I've taken a nap. Take a nap is actually number two

306
00:24:21,220 --> 00:24:23,140
Yeah

307
00:24:23,140 --> 00:24:25,140
Not under do things

308
00:24:25,300 --> 00:24:28,380
It is this is all part of the do things umbrella

309
00:24:28,380 --> 00:24:36,100
Okay, clean organize or DIY your room fuck off. That's not passing time. That's work. That's chores doing stuff. I

310
00:24:36,860 --> 00:24:41,540
All right. Listen, we need to get back in our brainscape because the second method is using your imagination

311
00:24:41,540 --> 00:24:47,260
Imagination imagine conversations plug your ears and make up random things that people are saying around you

312
00:24:47,740 --> 00:24:49,340
Wait, awesome

313
00:24:49,340 --> 00:24:50,900
What?

314
00:24:50,900 --> 00:24:55,980
The action of a healthy person that is one of the wildest things I've ever heard

315
00:24:55,980 --> 00:25:01,820
It's not imagine a conversation you might have where you're doing both parts plug your ears and imagine

316
00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:05,220
You're a fly on the wall and people are talking around you

317
00:25:05,460 --> 00:25:08,860
Yeah, but like that sounds wild but you know

318
00:25:08,860 --> 00:25:12,700
That's what Stephen King is doing all the time 18 hours a day. Yeah

319
00:25:13,340 --> 00:25:17,220
Then the only way to quiet it is to write it down. It's a right

320
00:25:17,540 --> 00:25:24,560
He plugs his ears at a nice restaurant and just looks around. He just thinks like Jeremy. There's a big mummy behind you

321
00:25:25,500 --> 00:25:30,140
That's not that's not right Steven. I'm gonna do name the skateboard of ghost ravine

322
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:36,380
Perfect when I put on this mask, it makes me into a skeleton that stabs butts. No

323
00:25:36,380 --> 00:25:37,380
Fuck

324
00:25:37,380 --> 00:25:39,380
Fuck that's not it. That's not it either

325
00:25:40,620 --> 00:25:49,620
Do you know what would be so dumb if I was Stephen King to drop a 50,000 word book about a skeleton that stabs butts on my editor's desk and be like

326
00:25:49,620 --> 00:25:53,620
It's the master of horror's mask

327
00:25:53,620 --> 00:25:58,620
You have to print it and if you change a word I'll burn this building down around

328
00:25:58,620 --> 00:26:05,620
Do you know who I am? I'm Stephen King. I'm Stephen King. This is my new vision. It's about a skeleton that stabs butts

329
00:26:05,620 --> 00:26:07,620
Oh print, mr. Bone of the butts

330
00:26:09,020 --> 00:26:11,860
Wait is Steven is there a 1.0? No

331
00:26:12,580 --> 00:26:15,060
Turn to page 800. There's a twist. Yep

332
00:26:15,060 --> 00:26:19,220
The knife turns people into skeletons and then they stab more butts now

333
00:26:19,220 --> 00:26:24,220
I know you're wondering does bony butt stabber live in coastal Maine and the answer is yes, of course

334
00:26:24,220 --> 00:26:26,220
He does

335
00:26:26,300 --> 00:26:33,140
And he loves the Red Sox now my butt my butts been stabbed I that's my job

336
00:26:33,140 --> 00:26:35,980
Fantastic right small butt stab under the but not squash

337
00:26:36,900 --> 00:26:39,100
Are you some kind of skeleton? Wow?

338
00:26:40,740 --> 00:26:44,940
Imagine Grover's Corners never saw a butt stabber like mr. Bono before

339
00:26:46,580 --> 00:26:52,260
You've never seen anyone from Maine with the way that you are doing this accident correction

340
00:26:52,260 --> 00:26:57,300
I was I was the dad of the girl. Mr. Webb in in our newspaper man

341
00:26:57,300 --> 00:27:03,860
Mm-hmm. Okay. He's the editor of the newspaper down in global. I still remember all the words from my partner our town

342
00:27:03,860 --> 00:27:07,780
I used I would say this is our town. That's what we like it that way

343
00:27:07,780 --> 00:27:13,940
All I remember is that's all right smart farm. All right, smart. All right. Okay, so there's so much more guys, please

344
00:27:14,140 --> 00:27:16,140
Imagine that you're a spy. Okay, cool

345
00:27:16,340 --> 00:27:21,780
Yes, I do that. Well, what if you're already a spy trying to pass time? Yeah, then imagine you're just

346
00:27:23,100 --> 00:27:24,860
You work out office

347
00:27:24,860 --> 00:27:32,500
My name's Doug photocopy photocopy photocopy. Oh, does anyone you have does anyone tried the new office milk?

348
00:27:32,500 --> 00:27:33,700
Oh

349
00:27:33,700 --> 00:27:35,700
No, I stopped. I forgot. I'm a spy

350
00:27:37,060 --> 00:27:39,980
That's how the new James Bond movie ends by the way, yeah

351
00:27:40,220 --> 00:27:44,020
Put yourself this way yourself in someone else's head blah blah blah assign superpowers

352
00:27:44,260 --> 00:27:48,460
Decide what superpowers everyone in the room would have try to be creative but keep the powers useful

353
00:27:50,220 --> 00:27:52,100
Okay

354
00:27:52,100 --> 00:27:57,060
This is exhausting. It sounds so hard. Yeah. Okay. Well then let's try this next one because it could be this one

355
00:27:57,060 --> 00:27:59,060
I think is a pretty fun way to pass the time

356
00:28:00,020 --> 00:28:02,020
Imagine your past loved ones

357
00:28:02,220 --> 00:28:07,760
Have an imaginary conversation with someone that you love that has passed on what would they say about where you are in life now?

358
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:10,240
What would they say about what the afterlife life is like?

359
00:28:12,380 --> 00:28:19,280
Normal way to kick it on a Thursday afternoon. I got ten minutes of the DMV. Hey me ma

360
00:28:19,280 --> 00:28:26,240
What's the internal rest like? What's the damn this stop light this stop? I say forever. Don't you think so rush limbaugh?

361
00:28:29,160 --> 00:28:34,280
Then that's fun cuz you can make him be like, oh I pooped my pants hell is bad. I

362
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:44,000
Bet though the libs made this stop light the libs love their gotta go a devil stab me in the butt and I'm turning into a

363
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,000
skeleton

364
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:50,800
It's all real. It's all very real Stephen King was right

365
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:56,480
We should have listened

366
00:28:57,320 --> 00:28:59,320
He tried to warn us

367
00:29:00,120 --> 00:29:02,120
It was a prophecy

368
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:05,400
And they loved the Red Sox

369
00:29:08,920 --> 00:29:11,800
Buddy what's never is a documentary. I keep doing

370
00:29:11,800 --> 00:29:17,240
Everybody why don't they listen to me? Why didn't we come up with a name for documentary for books?

371
00:29:19,320 --> 00:29:23,640
I tried to say book you better and they laughed me out of the room. It's real

372
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:29,160
Oh, there's no word for vocabulary, but he does

373
00:29:37,480 --> 00:29:42,760
We are halfway through play a game with yourself for other people whatever start a new TV show, okay play a prank

374
00:29:43,320 --> 00:29:49,080
It's better to start a new TV show. We've tried that one many many times. It's very unsatisfying. It takes a long time

375
00:29:49,080 --> 00:29:55,120
All right, trust me you end up in a lot of zoom calls pitching your idea and then nobody wants it. Yeah

376
00:29:56,040 --> 00:30:02,240
Step five on I'm skipping a lot now step five of having fun is read a book. So they said they do circle that boy

377
00:30:02,760 --> 00:30:03,960
Yeah

378
00:30:03,960 --> 00:30:05,960
this next one hits

379
00:30:06,040 --> 00:30:13,080
So paradoxical so fucking fast. Okay, we are we've moved on to the last subsection method for being productive

380
00:30:13,680 --> 00:30:17,520
first step one use the Internet

Okay exercise barf make a friend yeah, it's that easy

00:30:37,320 --> 00:30:42,320
Make a matter what you know people always say that but it's not it's not that simple

386
00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:48,160
It's a pretty tough and then finally dream the dream make a top ten list for what you want to do with your life

387
00:30:48,760 --> 00:30:53,840

Hey today's episode is also sponsored by honey

432
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:25,240
We all use internet and sometimes we use it to pass the time

433
00:34:25,380 --> 00:34:28,300
but sometimes we use it to buy shit and

434
00:34:28,300 --> 00:34:36,100
Honey is a free browser extension that scours the internet for promo codes and applies the best one if it finds it to your cart

435
00:34:36,100 --> 00:34:41,700
And do you think we use a promo code for honey? Do you think that honey would explode?

436
00:34:42,260 --> 00:34:44,220
whoa

437
00:34:44,220 --> 00:34:45,500
Yes

438
00:34:45,500 --> 00:34:51,060
Probably I hope not because I do think we have a promo code. Yeah, that's wild to think about Travis

00:34:51,060 --> 00:34:55,380
Anyway, imagine shopping on one of your favorite sites like okay

When you check out the honey button drops down, and it says I see you're looking at

Papa John's Pizza, but we do have coupons for Pizza Hut it said I don't actually know that it does that

443
00:35:10,660 --> 00:35:12,660
Let me start over

444
00:35:13,860 --> 00:35:16,060
Imagine you're shopping on one of your favorite sites

445
00:35:16,660 --> 00:35:20,820
Okay, Google and when you check out the honey button drops down wait

446

We use this yeah for sure I use honey a lot when I buy like a virtual instrument

00:35:49,500 --> 00:35:52,500
Bullshit because there's always sales on those going on

452
00:35:53,820 --> 00:35:57,900
There's so many different ways that honey has saved me money on different things that I

That I buy on on websites honey saved my life once it's true. Yeah, I I

Cut myself very badly and so I googled

Need paramedics and honey was like I can get you those paramedics for free

504
00:38:53,700 --> 00:38:55,460
Like where the fuck do you get off

505
00:38:55,460 --> 00:38:58,120
telling Justin you're busy after we give you your big break?

506
00:38:58,120 --> 00:38:59,740
Yeah, that sucks.

507
00:38:59,740 --> 00:39:01,900
I had a bat mitzvah.

508
00:39:01,900 --> 00:39:02,740
Okay.

509
00:39:02,740 --> 00:39:03,560
That's actually fun.

510
00:39:03,560 --> 00:39:04,400
That's actually really fucking funny.

511
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:05,460
Hey, can I say something?

512
00:39:05,460 --> 00:39:07,540
Can I, hey, it's Justin here.

513
00:39:07,540 --> 00:39:08,380
That was funny.

514
00:39:08,380 --> 00:39:09,200
That was great.

515
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:10,040
That kicked ass.

516
00:39:10,040 --> 00:39:12,740
Don't just like go, I had to go do a bat mitzvah.

517
00:39:12,740 --> 00:39:13,580
We definitely heard it.

518
00:39:13,580 --> 00:39:14,580
Yeah, yeah, I get it.

519
00:39:14,580 --> 00:39:16,780
It's pretty funny, but also like we're talking about donuts

520
00:39:16,780 --> 00:39:17,700
and it's Halloween donuts

521
00:39:17,700 --> 00:39:19,980
and like it's literally like the only time of year

522
00:39:19,980 --> 00:39:22,780
where we expect you to like show up.

523
00:39:22,780 --> 00:39:23,820
And do anything.

524
00:39:23,820 --> 00:39:26,980
Fine, but you have to pay me double my normal rate.

525
00:39:26,980 --> 00:39:27,820
That won't be a problem.

526
00:39:27,820 --> 00:39:28,660
$20?

527
00:39:28,660 --> 00:39:29,620
Okay.

528
00:39:29,620 --> 00:39:30,460
No.

529
00:39:30,460 --> 00:39:31,420
What?

530
00:39:31,420 --> 00:39:35,740
Something much more precious than money.

531
00:39:36,740 --> 00:39:38,220
Like a switch?

532
00:39:38,220 --> 00:39:40,700
Something thick and crimson.

533
00:39:41,780 --> 00:39:44,060
I would actually, I'll give you some of my blood

534
00:39:44,060 --> 00:39:45,500
to not make that sound anymore.

535
00:39:45,500 --> 00:39:46,340
Yeah.

536
00:39:46,340 --> 00:39:49,380
That is how I do it all the time.

537
00:39:49,380 --> 00:39:50,900
Welcome to Munch Squad.

538
00:39:50,900 --> 00:39:53,100
I am Count Donut.

539
00:39:53,100 --> 00:39:56,180
The spooky season is truly here.

540
00:39:56,180 --> 00:39:59,220
First, Dunkin' Donut has a,

541
00:40:00,700 --> 00:40:05,700
it says the sweet not scary spider donut.

542
00:40:06,580 --> 00:40:11,500
It's a orange with a chocolate munchkin in the middle

543
00:40:11,500 --> 00:40:15,100
and brown icing to look like a spider.

544
00:40:15,100 --> 00:40:16,980
I hate that.

545
00:40:16,980 --> 00:40:18,620
It's very scary.

546
00:40:18,620 --> 00:40:23,620
We've also got the peanut butter cup macchiato.

547
00:40:23,620 --> 00:40:24,460
What?

548
00:40:25,580 --> 00:40:26,500
Halloween.

549
00:40:26,500 --> 00:40:31,500
This is what Ando Caffur says.

550
00:40:31,580 --> 00:40:35,380
Halloween is always a fearfully fun holiday at Dunkin'.

551
00:40:35,380 --> 00:40:37,980
This year we're going all in for the occasion,

552
00:40:37,980 --> 00:40:41,580
celebrating our Halloween enthusiasts

553
00:40:41,580 --> 00:40:46,420
with not only the sweetest new peanut butter cup macchiato,

554
00:40:46,420 --> 00:40:49,380
but also a very special scary sweepstakes.

555
00:40:49,380 --> 00:40:51,420
Oh, how fun.

556
00:40:51,420 --> 00:40:54,860
It offers $1,000 per day

557
00:40:54,860 --> 00:40:58,060
at the virtual trick-or-treating experience.

558
00:40:58,060 --> 00:40:58,900
What's the scary part?

559
00:40:58,900 --> 00:41:02,620
You can do this if you want to go to dunkendoor.com.

560
00:41:02,620 --> 00:41:06,820
It's an AR experience and you can ring the bell

561
00:41:06,820 --> 00:41:10,540
and it's a very scary and you maybe win some money.

562
00:41:10,540 --> 00:41:11,860
All right, all right.

563
00:41:11,860 --> 00:41:15,020
Spooky season is underway at Duck Donuts.

564
00:41:15,020 --> 00:41:16,540
At what?

565
00:41:16,540 --> 00:41:18,340
Duck Donuts.

566
00:41:18,340 --> 00:41:20,140
The spooky box is back.

567
00:41:20,140 --> 00:41:24,660
This spooky box is back

568
00:41:24,660 --> 00:41:26,300
and it gives a chilling goosebumps.

569
00:41:26,300 --> 00:41:29,500
It says chilling goosebumps on your taste buds

570
00:41:29,500 --> 00:41:32,700
with delicious Halloween inspired combinations

571
00:41:32,700 --> 00:41:34,700
like dirt and worms.

572
00:41:34,700 --> 00:41:35,540
Oh, so great.

573
00:41:35,540 --> 00:41:36,420
What?

574
00:41:36,420 --> 00:41:38,300
Chocolate icing with Oreo cookie pieces

575
00:41:38,300 --> 00:41:39,900
and a limited time gummy worm.

576
00:41:39,900 --> 00:41:40,740
Oh, so it's not really.

577
00:41:40,740 --> 00:41:43,060
Hey, you get the gummy worm around me,

578
00:41:43,060 --> 00:41:45,060
they're all for a limited time.

579
00:41:45,060 --> 00:41:47,500
I love those chewy bastards.

580
00:41:47,500 --> 00:41:48,620
All right.

581
00:41:48,620 --> 00:41:49,620
So mummy.

582
00:41:49,620 --> 00:41:51,500
Shh, listen.

583
00:41:51,500 --> 00:41:52,580
It's a good joke.

584
00:41:52,580 --> 00:41:53,780
So mummy.

585
00:41:54,940 --> 00:41:56,420
So mummy.

586
00:41:56,420 --> 00:41:58,140
So mummy?

587
00:41:58,140 --> 00:41:58,980
So like a yummy.

588
00:41:58,980 --> 00:42:00,140
Oh, it's like yummy.

589
00:42:00,140 --> 00:42:00,980
Oh, shit.

590
00:42:00,980 --> 00:42:01,820
But it's mummy.

591
00:42:01,820 --> 00:42:05,380
So mummy, vanilla icing with peach and streusel topping

592
00:42:05,380 --> 00:42:07,220
and salted caramel drizzle.

593
00:42:07,220 --> 00:42:08,660
I would ruin one of those.

594
00:42:08,660 --> 00:42:09,500
Yes, I would.

595
00:42:09,500 --> 00:42:12,340
It in turn would ruin me.

596
00:42:12,340 --> 00:42:14,140
Halloween pumpkin.

597
00:42:14,140 --> 00:42:15,460
Okay, that's on the nose.

598
00:42:17,100 --> 00:42:19,100
He listened to this description.

599
00:42:19,100 --> 00:42:23,220
Pumpkin icing with Halloween sprinkles.

600
00:42:23,220 --> 00:42:25,380
What's a Halloween sprinkle?

601
00:42:25,380 --> 00:42:28,020
If you got a more daring guest in your party, Travis,

602
00:42:28,020 --> 00:42:29,460
are you a little more daring?

603
00:42:29,460 --> 00:42:30,580
No.

604
00:42:30,580 --> 00:42:33,180
You can conjure up your own haunting creations

605
00:42:33,180 --> 00:42:35,460
with this spooky box decorating kit.

606
00:42:35,460 --> 00:42:38,100
It comes with four donuts for a family

607
00:42:38,100 --> 00:42:41,420
or eight donuts and as a do-it-yourself

608
00:42:41,420 --> 00:42:44,420
with icing and toppings like a delicious gummy worms.

609
00:42:44,420 --> 00:42:46,740
Halloween it has never tasted so good.

610
00:42:46,740 --> 00:42:49,020
That's not that daring, all things considered.

611
00:42:49,020 --> 00:42:49,860
That's more just saying-

612
00:42:49,860 --> 00:42:51,740
You didn't hear about the dirt and worms?

613
00:42:51,740 --> 00:42:52,580
Yeah, but I mean-

614
00:42:52,580 --> 00:42:53,420
It's terrifying.

615
00:42:53,420 --> 00:42:55,660
It's just saying like, are you willing to take the dare

616
00:42:55,660 --> 00:42:57,940
to do the work that someone else could have done for you

617
00:42:57,940 --> 00:42:59,540
for the same price?

618
00:42:59,540 --> 00:43:01,500
But your kids would love to do this

619
00:43:01,500 --> 00:43:02,580
and make a huge mess. No, they won't.

620
00:43:02,580 --> 00:43:04,060
They'll start for three seconds

621
00:43:04,060 --> 00:43:06,180
and then I'll have to do it. Make a huge mess.

622
00:43:06,180 --> 00:43:08,460
Justin's kids love to do shit.

623
00:43:08,460 --> 00:43:09,380
And make a huge mess.

624
00:43:09,380 --> 00:43:11,900
My kids like the idea of it.

625
00:43:11,900 --> 00:43:15,420
And then they remember that apparently I work for them.

626
00:43:15,420 --> 00:43:16,620
This is the scariest one of all.

627
00:43:16,620 --> 00:43:17,980
Oh, fuck.

628
00:43:17,980 --> 00:43:20,820
I don't want you to be too terrified when I launch in.

629
00:43:20,820 --> 00:43:24,860
So make sure you've braced yourself for true terror

630
00:43:24,860 --> 00:43:27,220
because once I reveal to you the name

631
00:43:27,220 --> 00:43:31,060
that Krispy Kreme has chosen for their Halloween lineup,

632
00:43:31,060 --> 00:43:34,100
you will be chilled to the very bone.

633
00:43:34,100 --> 00:43:36,740
You will look to the edge of existence

634
00:43:36,740 --> 00:43:38,620
and you will be insane for it.

635
00:43:38,620 --> 00:43:39,460
Okay.

636
00:43:39,460 --> 00:43:40,300
Okay.

637
00:43:40,300 --> 00:43:41,340
Are you ready for this?

638
00:43:41,340 --> 00:43:42,180
I guess so.

639
00:43:42,180 --> 00:43:43,020
Are you fully braced?

640
00:43:43,020 --> 00:43:44,260
Yeah, no, I'm, yeah.

641
00:43:44,260 --> 00:43:47,140
I told Guillermo del Toro this, he shit his own pants.

642
00:43:47,140 --> 00:43:48,420
Oh, wow.

643
00:43:48,420 --> 00:43:49,260
Yeah.

644
00:43:49,260 --> 00:43:50,100
You know Guillermo del Toro now?

645
00:43:50,100 --> 00:43:51,660
You've gotten so big.

646
00:43:51,660 --> 00:43:53,340
Thank you, yes.

647
00:43:53,340 --> 00:43:54,500
He's a dear friend.

648
00:43:54,500 --> 00:43:55,700
Okay. Named Robert.

649
00:43:55,700 --> 00:43:59,740
Krispy Kreme launches Halloween lineup of

650
00:44:01,500 --> 00:44:03,380
Krispy Scream Donuts.

651
00:44:03,380 --> 00:44:04,220
No!

652
00:44:04,220 --> 00:44:05,780
No!

653
00:44:05,780 --> 00:44:07,620
I've driven myself mad.

654
00:44:07,620 --> 00:44:08,820
No!

655
00:44:08,820 --> 00:44:10,580
I'm now from terror.

656
00:44:10,580 --> 00:44:12,180
Oh, God.

657
00:44:12,180 --> 00:44:15,500
The darkness, it's everywhere.

658
00:44:15,500 --> 00:44:17,060
Under a witchy theme,

659
00:44:17,060 --> 00:44:19,740
Krispy Kreme has transformed to Krispy Scream.

660
00:44:19,740 --> 00:44:21,060
I said it again.

661
00:44:21,060 --> 00:44:22,820
I have to stop saying it.

662
00:44:22,820 --> 00:44:23,660
Ah!

663
00:44:24,940 --> 00:44:29,740
They complete with a very scary logo change.

664
00:44:29,740 --> 00:44:30,580
All right.

665
00:44:30,580 --> 00:44:31,420
That actually just sounds expensive.

666
00:44:31,420 --> 00:44:36,420
Free donuts and the treat of a dollar dozen every Saturday.

667
00:44:36,980 --> 00:44:37,980
Okay.

668
00:44:37,980 --> 00:44:41,580
Plus, a free donut offer on Halloween.

669
00:44:41,580 --> 00:44:44,860
Beginning today, well, it's a while ago,

670
00:44:44,860 --> 00:44:47,780
beginning last Monday, Krispy Scream fans

671
00:44:47,780 --> 00:44:49,620
will be enchanted by four new donuts.

672
00:44:49,620 --> 00:44:52,180
Even when you kind of whisper it, it still like hurts.

673
00:44:52,180 --> 00:44:53,020
Yeah.

674
00:44:53,020 --> 00:44:53,860
It is hard, isn't it?

675
00:44:53,860 --> 00:44:55,060
There's new donuts.

676
00:44:55,060 --> 00:44:57,340
Who's the first one?

677
00:44:57,340 --> 00:44:58,780
Abracadabra.

678
00:44:58,780 --> 00:44:59,620
Abracadabra.

679
00:44:59,620 --> 00:45:02,980
Abracadabra donut.

680
00:45:02,980 --> 00:45:04,180
It's a long walk.

681
00:45:04,180 --> 00:45:05,940
It's a little sweaty, this one.

682
00:45:05,940 --> 00:45:08,260
This one comes with a little extra sweat.

683
00:45:08,260 --> 00:45:10,220
It's like, it's a donut.

684
00:45:10,220 --> 00:45:12,340
Enchanted Cauldron Donut.

685
00:45:12,340 --> 00:45:14,700
It's chocolate with a pretzel witch broomstick.

686
00:45:14,700 --> 00:45:16,820
Do you think that they came up with them in that order

687
00:45:16,820 --> 00:45:19,460
where they're like put a lot of work into abracadabra

688
00:45:19,460 --> 00:45:20,300
and then they were just like,

689
00:45:20,300 --> 00:45:22,620
and this one's like an enchanted cauldron,

690
00:45:22,620 --> 00:45:24,620
so we're just gonna call it that.

691
00:45:24,620 --> 00:45:27,060
Bewitched Broomstick Donut,

692
00:45:27,060 --> 00:45:31,820
which is an unglazed shell donut dipped in purple icing

693
00:45:31,820 --> 00:45:34,540
decorated with icing swirl and gold stars.

694
00:45:34,540 --> 00:45:35,380
Okay.

695
00:45:35,380 --> 00:45:38,700
And then most terrifying of all, the Spooky Sprinkled.

696
00:45:38,700 --> 00:45:41,460
It's orange icing and topped with,

697
00:45:42,700 --> 00:45:46,620
I shudder to this Halloween sprinkle.

698
00:45:46,620 --> 00:45:49,020
Again, it rears its head.

699
00:45:49,020 --> 00:45:49,940
I shit myself.

700
00:45:49,940 --> 00:45:52,900
Saturday's beginning October 16th to Halloween

701
00:45:52,900 --> 00:45:54,900
will be scary great.

702
00:45:54,900 --> 00:45:57,740
It's like fairy, but spooky.

703
00:45:57,740 --> 00:46:01,420
For Krispy Scream fans who can give a dollar a dozen

704
00:46:01,420 --> 00:46:02,620
to share with family and friends

705
00:46:02,620 --> 00:46:04,140
with the purchase of any dozen.

706
00:46:05,060 --> 00:46:09,500
They call them Saturday Scary Sherries.

707
00:46:09,500 --> 00:46:10,340
Huh.

708
00:46:11,700 --> 00:46:12,540
Huh.

709
00:46:13,460 --> 00:46:15,820
Even, I tell this to Richard Scary,

710
00:46:15,820 --> 00:46:18,140
he barf on his children.

711
00:46:18,140 --> 00:46:20,740
Even Richard Scary driven insane by this.

712
00:46:20,740 --> 00:46:22,740
I bet his children are adults at this point too,

713
00:46:22,740 --> 00:46:24,540
so that's gotta be wild.

714
00:46:24,540 --> 00:46:27,020
Let's just hope they're not litigious.

715
00:46:27,020 --> 00:46:30,060
We all deserve an incredibly great Halloween this year.

716
00:46:30,060 --> 00:46:30,900
Here we go.

717
00:46:30,900 --> 00:46:35,100
Still, we just have to keep referencing

718
00:46:35,100 --> 00:46:38,060
the fact that this is a bad time.

719
00:46:38,060 --> 00:46:41,100
And certainly the curry is a donut.

720
00:46:41,100 --> 00:46:44,020
We all deserve an incredibly great Halloween this year

721
00:46:44,020 --> 00:46:47,020
because of the ongoing COVID pandemic.

722
00:46:47,020 --> 00:46:49,020
It doesn't say this, but it's implied.

723
00:46:49,020 --> 00:46:53,460
So we're turning to Krispy Scream for the month

724
00:46:53,460 --> 00:46:56,780
and scaring up some amazing Halloween donuts

725
00:46:56,780 --> 00:46:59,460
along with some spooky good deals.

726
00:46:59,460 --> 00:47:00,700
This is Dave Skinner.

727
00:47:00,700 --> 00:47:02,660
I probably didn't even need to tell you.

728
00:47:02,660 --> 00:47:05,060
You could tell it Dave Skinner by the way.

729
00:47:05,060 --> 00:47:09,580
Help us have fun too by coming by on Halloween in costume.

730
00:47:09,580 --> 00:47:10,420
Oh boy.

731
00:47:10,420 --> 00:47:13,780
And we'll give you a free donut.

732
00:47:16,060 --> 00:47:18,180
Now you can share how you've been entranced

733
00:47:18,180 --> 00:47:20,580
by Krispy Scream's new donuts.

734
00:47:20,580 --> 00:47:22,140
No, I'm actually getting pretty in here too.

735
00:47:22,140 --> 00:47:25,860
This is what they want you to do

736
00:47:25,860 --> 00:47:30,860
for this incredible, incredible event.

737
00:47:30,860 --> 00:47:34,060
Hashtag Krispy Scream.

738
00:47:34,060 --> 00:47:39,060
They say that if you type hashtag Krispy Scream

739
00:47:39,060 --> 00:47:43,700
into your social media, it will make you insane

740
00:47:43,700 --> 00:47:45,900
and also your family be insane too

741
00:47:45,900 --> 00:47:48,060
and everyone driven mad by darkness.

742
00:47:48,060 --> 00:47:48,900
By tweeting it?

743
00:47:48,900 --> 00:47:53,100
Yeah, if you tweet the hashtag Krispy Scream,

744
00:47:53,100 --> 00:47:55,500
then you could be the first one to be driven mad

745
00:47:55,500 --> 00:47:56,340
by this incredible promotion.

746
00:47:56,340 --> 00:47:58,380
Don't be the last on your block.

747
00:47:58,380 --> 00:48:00,460
No, that would be so embarrassing.

748
00:48:00,460 --> 00:48:02,100
Now I will say this.

749
00:48:02,100 --> 00:48:05,860
Oh, Krispy, so they've already, this is confusing, right?

750
00:48:05,860 --> 00:48:08,580
Cause they already smell cream bad

751
00:48:08,580 --> 00:48:10,660
and then they're adding in the scream.

752
00:48:10,660 --> 00:48:11,980
It's very confusing.

753
00:48:11,980 --> 00:48:13,980
I've tried to do it three times.

754
00:48:15,220 --> 00:48:16,420
Here we go.

755
00:48:16,420 --> 00:48:17,900
Krispy.

756
00:48:17,900 --> 00:48:21,020
Let's just see the kind of heat this tag's been getting.

757
00:48:21,020 --> 00:48:23,700
Oh, there's not many.

758
00:48:23,700 --> 00:48:27,100
You know, here's the thing.

759
00:48:27,100 --> 00:48:30,060
We could take over this hashtag.

760
00:48:30,060 --> 00:48:31,660
No, Donut.

761
00:48:31,660 --> 00:48:34,980
We could own this.

762
00:48:34,980 --> 00:48:37,220
We could own this hashtag.

763
00:48:37,220 --> 00:48:38,620
Here's Krispy Scream.

764
00:48:38,620 --> 00:48:39,780
There's five tweets.

765
00:48:39,780 --> 00:48:40,620
Let's take this.

766
00:48:40,620 --> 00:48:42,340
Now Count Donut, we can do this on one.

767
00:48:42,340 --> 00:48:44,380
Let's have this hashtag for our very own.

768
00:48:44,380 --> 00:48:46,260
Here's the thing Count Donut, we can do this,

769
00:48:46,260 --> 00:48:48,820
but the tweets that you do

770
00:48:48,820 --> 00:48:51,900
have to be completely and utterly innocuous.

771
00:48:51,900 --> 00:48:53,940
Like had a great day.

772
00:48:53,940 --> 00:48:54,780
Oh man.

773
00:48:54,780 --> 00:48:56,100
You guys see that tree?

774
00:48:56,100 --> 00:48:57,060
Krispy Scream.

775
00:48:57,060 --> 00:48:59,780
That's the only way I will allow this Count Donut.

776
00:49:01,260 --> 00:49:03,460
That seems more harmful than talking about

777
00:49:03,460 --> 00:49:06,460
how these donuts have driven you to the brink of madness.

778
00:49:06,460 --> 00:49:07,700
Okay, then let's do that.

779
00:49:07,700 --> 00:49:10,020
Just use the tag to tell how the donuts

780
00:49:10,020 --> 00:49:11,340
have driven you mad.

781
00:49:11,340 --> 00:49:12,180
Yeah, okay.

782
00:49:12,180 --> 00:49:14,700
Yeah, now I can get on board with that.

783
00:49:14,700 --> 00:49:19,700
Yes, I want to take over this K-R-I-S-P-Y-S-K-R-E-N-E.

784
00:49:20,180 --> 00:49:22,060
Oh, it's spelled bad too, huh?

785
00:49:22,060 --> 00:49:24,940
It's spelled so bad, so it's ours now.

786
00:49:24,940 --> 00:49:28,140
And we'll use it for just horror.

787
00:49:28,140 --> 00:49:32,100
Just absolute Lovecraftian nightmare.

788
00:49:32,100 --> 00:49:34,220
Yeah, there you go.

789
00:49:34,220 --> 00:49:36,220
About the dark ones and the donuts.

790
00:49:36,220 --> 00:49:38,500
So anyway, get the donuts.

791
00:49:38,500 --> 00:49:40,740
Or don't, whatever.

792
00:49:40,740 --> 00:49:43,300
Eat the donuts or don't, it's up to you.

793
00:49:43,300 --> 00:49:44,860
You're starting to sound a lot like Richard Stink,

794
00:49:44,860 --> 00:49:45,700
Mr. Dracula.

795
00:49:45,700 --> 00:49:46,820
Yeah, a little bit.

796
00:49:46,820 --> 00:49:48,820
How about another one of these great questions?

797
00:49:48,820 --> 00:49:50,700
I must bring Justin back to life one more time.

798
00:49:50,700 --> 00:49:51,540
Oh God, you killed him?

799
00:49:51,540 --> 00:49:52,380
Why do people-

800
00:49:52,380 --> 00:49:53,220
I kill him every time I do this.

801
00:49:53,220 --> 00:49:54,580
People keep killing Justin.

802
00:49:54,580 --> 00:49:56,100
Do you want me to read the question?

803
00:49:56,100 --> 00:49:57,580
No.

804
00:49:57,580 --> 00:49:59,460
Sorry, it's still me, I was a vape.

805
00:49:59,460 --> 00:50:01,300
Okay, yeah, go ahead and get your vape stand.

806
00:50:01,300 --> 00:50:04,820
Did the huge, huge rip off my vape.

807
00:50:04,820 --> 00:50:07,140
One sec, let me rip this cotton out.

808
00:50:08,380 --> 00:50:10,380
All right, here's Justin.

809
00:50:10,380 --> 00:50:11,220
Hey guys. Hi.

810
00:50:11,220 --> 00:50:13,540
Oh man, you've vaped it up.

811
00:50:13,540 --> 00:50:14,660
Such a huge cloud.

812
00:50:14,660 --> 00:50:15,500
Blood vape.

813
00:50:15,500 --> 00:50:17,020
Is it blood flavor?

814
00:50:17,020 --> 00:50:18,620
It's blood flavor.

815
00:50:18,620 --> 00:50:19,780
No, sorry, blood orange.

816
00:50:19,780 --> 00:50:21,220
I misread the file.

817
00:50:21,220 --> 00:50:22,260
That's refreshing.

818
00:50:22,260 --> 00:50:24,340
We said we were gonna do a lot of questions this time.

819
00:50:24,340 --> 00:50:25,180
We're gonna fire these off.

820
00:50:25,180 --> 00:50:26,020
We're gonna get more.

821
00:50:26,020 --> 00:50:26,860
You ready?

822
00:50:26,860 --> 00:50:29,460
I'm in a new city for work and on my walk to my job,

823
00:50:29,460 --> 00:50:32,140
I pass a house with a trampoline in the side yard.

824
00:50:32,140 --> 00:50:34,380
There is very little division between the yard

825
00:50:34,380 --> 00:50:35,900
and the sidewalk and the trampoline is no more

826
00:50:35,900 --> 00:50:37,780
than 15 feet from me as I pass.

827
00:50:37,780 --> 00:50:39,340
Brothers, what is the protocol for using

828
00:50:39,340 --> 00:50:40,180
a stranger's trampoline?

829
00:50:40,180 --> 00:50:41,340
Rip it.

830
00:50:41,340 --> 00:50:46,340
Is it stealing if I just hop on for a few bounces

831
00:50:47,300 --> 00:50:48,420
on my way to work?

832
00:50:49,340 --> 00:50:50,980
That's from grounded in Greenboro.

833
00:50:50,980 --> 00:50:53,260
Yes, let's just, can we, boys, please?

834
00:50:53,260 --> 00:50:55,900
Yes, it's stealing.

835
00:50:55,900 --> 00:50:57,140
You, it's stealing.

836
00:50:57,140 --> 00:50:59,740
You all know there's other crimes other than stealing,

837
00:50:59,740 --> 00:51:00,580
right?

838
00:51:00,580 --> 00:51:02,060
Yeah. Yeah.

839
00:51:02,060 --> 00:51:04,260
There's like, one might be trespassing.

840
00:51:04,260 --> 00:51:05,220
That's one, yeah.

841
00:51:05,220 --> 00:51:06,060
One that you might do.

842
00:51:06,060 --> 00:51:06,900
Trespassing.

843
00:51:06,900 --> 00:51:07,740
It's don't do.

844
00:51:07,740 --> 00:51:08,580
Trespassing.

845
00:51:08,580 --> 00:51:12,820
But for real, there's some great questions on this week.

846
00:51:12,820 --> 00:51:16,140
Don't bounce on a stranger's trampoline.

847
00:51:16,140 --> 00:51:17,240
What, why?

848
00:51:18,300 --> 00:51:20,940
Justin, if you had a trampoline in your yard,

849
00:51:20,940 --> 00:51:21,980
if you had a trampoline in your yard

850
00:51:21,980 --> 00:51:25,660
and you looked outside and there was a stranger rando adult

851
00:51:25,660 --> 00:51:27,440
having a bounce on their way to work

852
00:51:27,440 --> 00:51:28,940
with their briefcase and everything.

853
00:51:28,940 --> 00:51:29,760
Should be polite about it.

854
00:51:29,760 --> 00:51:30,600
What?

855
00:51:30,600 --> 00:51:31,440
Oh, wait, hold on, Griffin.

856
00:51:31,440 --> 00:51:32,260
You actually just sold it for me

857
00:51:32,260 --> 00:51:34,380
because if they have a briefcase and everything,

858
00:51:34,380 --> 00:51:35,220
then this is-

859
00:51:35,220 --> 00:51:36,660
It's a businessman who's like finally free.

860
00:51:36,660 --> 00:51:38,500
This is a full blown music video moment

861
00:51:38,500 --> 00:51:39,340
and I'm here for it, Griffin.

862
00:51:39,340 --> 00:51:41,300
Yeah, I freed the businessman.

863
00:51:41,300 --> 00:51:42,140
Okay.

864
00:51:42,140 --> 00:51:42,960
That's the only way that it's-

865
00:51:42,960 --> 00:51:43,800
I think that's the one time.

866
00:51:43,800 --> 00:51:45,720
The only time that's acceptable.

867
00:51:45,720 --> 00:51:48,020
If you're holding to like a travel mug of coffee

868
00:51:48,020 --> 00:51:50,460
that you're drinking from while you're bouncing

869
00:51:50,460 --> 00:51:54,500
and you have your briefcase in one hand

870
00:51:54,500 --> 00:51:56,900
and full like suit, then it's okay.

871
00:51:56,900 --> 00:51:59,840
But if you're doing it in grownup clothes,

872
00:51:59,840 --> 00:52:04,140
looking at me through the window, completely stone-faced.

873
00:52:05,420 --> 00:52:06,260
With a thumbs up.

874
00:52:06,260 --> 00:52:07,980
With a thumbs up, you must leave.

875
00:52:07,980 --> 00:52:08,980
Or I must.

876
00:52:08,980 --> 00:52:11,100
Next question.

877
00:52:11,100 --> 00:52:12,440
There's a security guard at work

878
00:52:12,440 --> 00:52:14,060
who keeps on trying to scare me.

879
00:52:14,060 --> 00:52:16,780
They regularly sneak upon me and go boo

880
00:52:16,780 --> 00:52:18,860
or jump out at me from behind doors.

881
00:52:18,860 --> 00:52:20,660
They're not very good at scaring me

882
00:52:20,660 --> 00:52:23,580
and their scares never seem to get the desired reaction.

883
00:52:23,580 --> 00:52:26,500
This is a problem seeing as they're an amazing cook

884
00:52:26,500 --> 00:52:27,900
and are known to give free food

885
00:52:27,900 --> 00:52:29,340
to people they scare successfully.

886
00:52:29,340 --> 00:52:30,900
What is this business?

887
00:52:30,900 --> 00:52:35,100
I have tried their cooking at pre-pandemic potlucks

888
00:52:35,100 --> 00:52:37,620
and still dream of their coconut shrimp to this day.

889
00:52:37,620 --> 00:52:39,620
How do I give a convincing enough performance

890
00:52:39,620 --> 00:52:41,740
to arm me some delicious seafood curry?

891
00:52:41,740 --> 00:52:43,620
That's from a hungry, hungry museum worker.

892
00:52:43,620 --> 00:52:44,460
None of this makes any sense to me.

893
00:52:44,460 --> 00:52:46,240
Okay, the fact they work in a museum

894
00:52:46,240 --> 00:52:50,140
twists and turns this thing fucking completely for me.

895
00:52:50,140 --> 00:52:52,540
If it was an office and people were pulling this shit,

896
00:52:52,540 --> 00:52:54,700
it would be like, this is a place of business.

897
00:52:54,700 --> 00:52:58,020
But if someone is dressing up like the mummy

898
00:52:58,020 --> 00:53:00,260
or like Bony Butt Stabber

899
00:53:00,260 --> 00:53:04,060
and doing this in a museum setting, that's fun.

900
00:53:04,060 --> 00:53:05,620
I think that's pretty fun.

901
00:53:05,620 --> 00:53:07,580
Yep, absolutely fun.

902
00:53:07,580 --> 00:53:09,100
I think it's fun to get scared in a museum

903
00:53:09,100 --> 00:53:13,220
and then get yummy like red lobster appetizers out of it.

904
00:53:13,220 --> 00:53:14,800
Like that kicks ass to me.

905
00:53:15,900 --> 00:53:18,360
Yeah, that sounds choice.

906
00:53:18,360 --> 00:53:19,200
Now Justin-

907
00:53:19,200 --> 00:53:20,940
And I'd love to go to a museum.

908
00:53:20,940 --> 00:53:21,980
You guys remember those?

909
00:53:21,980 --> 00:53:22,820
I do.

910
00:53:22,820 --> 00:53:24,900
It's like a big house full of old things.

911
00:53:24,900 --> 00:53:26,460
And at night they come to life

912
00:53:26,460 --> 00:53:27,300
and they give you life lessons.

913
00:53:27,300 --> 00:53:28,900
At night, every one of them comes to life.

914
00:53:28,900 --> 00:53:30,580
Love that shit.

915
00:53:30,580 --> 00:53:34,060
At hotel, they have pictures they hang on.

916
00:53:34,060 --> 00:53:35,740
This is like that, but bigger

917
00:53:35,740 --> 00:53:37,860
and the pictures are way better.

918
00:53:37,860 --> 00:53:38,700
Way better.

919
00:53:38,700 --> 00:53:40,780
And sometimes they're done by people whose names you know,

920
00:53:40,780 --> 00:53:41,620
which is nice.

921
00:53:41,620 --> 00:53:42,440
Right.

922
00:53:42,440 --> 00:53:43,280
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

923
00:53:43,280 --> 00:53:44,120
Whoa.

924
00:53:44,120 --> 00:53:46,260
Now we all three have kids

925
00:53:46,260 --> 00:53:47,100
and I don't know about you guys,

926
00:53:47,100 --> 00:53:49,860
but my kid B.B. tries to scare me

927
00:53:49,860 --> 00:53:52,860
by jumping out and saying boo a lot.

928
00:53:52,860 --> 00:53:53,700
Yeah.

929
00:53:53,700 --> 00:53:54,780
So I've really tried to perfect this,

930
00:53:54,780 --> 00:53:56,700
like, oh God, oh.

931
00:53:56,700 --> 00:53:57,540
Oh man.

932
00:53:57,540 --> 00:53:58,360
Yeah.

933
00:53:58,360 --> 00:53:59,300
Whoa.

934
00:53:59,300 --> 00:54:00,900
And then it's kind of a laugh, right?

935
00:54:00,900 --> 00:54:02,780
It's that like, oh my God.

936
00:54:02,780 --> 00:54:03,980
Oh, now a breath.

937
00:54:03,980 --> 00:54:05,020
Oh, I can see how funny.

938
00:54:05,020 --> 00:54:06,700
I'm so happy to be alive.

939
00:54:06,700 --> 00:54:07,600
And if you want to say like,

940
00:54:07,600 --> 00:54:09,420
I'm so happy to still be alive now

941
00:54:09,420 --> 00:54:10,700
because for a second there,

942
00:54:10,700 --> 00:54:12,580
I thought that the mummy was going to kill me.

943
00:54:12,580 --> 00:54:15,680
Oh man, I can't wait to eat coconut shrimp

944
00:54:15,680 --> 00:54:16,940
and feel alive, right?

945
00:54:16,940 --> 00:54:17,780
Something like that.

946
00:54:17,780 --> 00:54:18,600
Makes it worth it.

947
00:54:18,600 --> 00:54:19,440
Yeah, that's good stuff.

948
00:54:19,440 --> 00:54:20,280
That's good stuff.

949
00:54:20,280 --> 00:54:21,940
Man, the next coconut shrimp I eat

950
00:54:21,940 --> 00:54:23,540
will be the most tasty coconut shrimp

951
00:54:23,540 --> 00:54:25,260
I've ever had in my life.

952
00:54:25,260 --> 00:54:27,180
Henry's got this big plastic skeleton hand

953
00:54:27,180 --> 00:54:28,320
on the end of a long stick

954
00:54:28,320 --> 00:54:30,340
that he likes to use to like scare me,

955
00:54:30,340 --> 00:54:32,620
like wave it around a wall or something

956
00:54:32,620 --> 00:54:34,300
to make me think that bony butt stabber's coming for me.

957
00:54:34,300 --> 00:54:36,740
And after this recording, it will work every time.

958
00:54:36,740 --> 00:54:39,500
But yesterday he did hit me in the face with it accidentally.

959
00:54:39,500 --> 00:54:40,780
And guess what?

960
00:54:40,780 --> 00:54:41,620
Guess what?

961
00:54:41,620 --> 00:54:43,700
I am very scared of that skeleton hand now

962
00:54:43,700 --> 00:54:45,220
when it's in my boy's hands.

963
00:54:45,220 --> 00:54:46,460
I don't trust him as far as I can throw him.

964
00:54:46,460 --> 00:54:49,620
And I can throw him awfully far.

965
00:54:49,620 --> 00:54:52,500
That's a really good, can I just say, for his age,

966
00:54:52,500 --> 00:54:53,940
it's a pretty good gag.

967
00:54:53,940 --> 00:54:55,420
Pretty good gag, hitting your dad in the face

968
00:54:55,420 --> 00:54:56,260
with a big bony butt stabber.

969
00:54:56,260 --> 00:54:58,260
Another hit in the face part, but that's good too.

970
00:54:58,260 --> 00:54:59,960
I mean, listen, he's little,

971
00:54:59,960 --> 00:55:01,180
so I doubt he hurt you that much,

972
00:55:01,180 --> 00:55:02,860
but you do have that glass face.

973
00:55:03,740 --> 00:55:05,300
Yeah.

974
00:55:05,300 --> 00:55:06,540
Do we have time for this next one?

975
00:55:06,540 --> 00:55:07,380
It excites me.

976
00:55:07,380 --> 00:55:08,660
Yeah.

977
00:55:08,660 --> 00:55:10,180
I set a fire in my dorm room

978
00:55:10,180 --> 00:55:12,700
trying to microwave a Red Lobster cheesy biscuit.

979
00:55:12,700 --> 00:55:14,300
It's wild that we talked about Red Lobster twice.

980
00:55:14,300 --> 00:55:15,140
That is wild.

981
00:55:15,140 --> 00:55:16,380
Okay.

982
00:55:16,380 --> 00:55:17,980
And then I had Red Lobster last night.

983
00:55:17,980 --> 00:55:18,820
How was it?

984
00:55:18,820 --> 00:55:19,660
Was it shrimp?

985
00:55:19,660 --> 00:55:20,480
Shrimp?

986
00:55:20,480 --> 00:55:21,320
Shrimp was?

987
00:55:21,320 --> 00:55:22,160
Their Brussels sprouts are pretty banging.

988
00:55:22,160 --> 00:55:22,980
Okay.

989
00:55:22,980 --> 00:55:23,820
I like a Brussels sprout.

990
00:55:23,820 --> 00:55:24,660
Yeah.

991
00:55:24,660 --> 00:55:25,480
Yeah.

992
00:55:25,480 --> 00:55:26,320
I mean, you know I love the biscuits.

993
00:55:26,320 --> 00:55:27,160
They call me Cheddar Bay Jay.

994
00:55:27,160 --> 00:55:27,980
Yeah, they do.

995
00:55:27,980 --> 00:55:28,820
Of course.

996
00:55:28,820 --> 00:55:31,500
But the Brussels sprouts are surprisingly on point.

997
00:55:31,500 --> 00:55:32,340
Yeah.

998
00:55:32,340 --> 00:55:33,160
Okay.

999
00:55:33,160 --> 00:55:35,020
Hey, well, thank you for listening.

1000
00:55:35,020 --> 00:55:37,500
Red Lobster never disappoints, except when it does.

1001
00:55:37,500 --> 00:55:38,340
Yep.

1002
00:55:38,340 --> 00:55:40,420
And when they fall, they fall hard, baby.

1003
00:55:40,420 --> 00:55:42,820
Fire and ice, Red Lobster.

1004
00:55:44,820 --> 00:55:46,580
My RA said I have to wait here

1005
00:55:46,580 --> 00:55:48,900
until the fire department comes.

1006
00:55:48,900 --> 00:55:50,900
I haven't had dinner and I'm very hungry.

1007
00:55:50,900 --> 00:55:52,820
The only food I have in my room,

1008
00:55:52,820 --> 00:55:54,660
my dorm, are microwave meals

1009
00:55:54,660 --> 00:55:59,660
and a few remaining Red Lobster Cheesy Biscuits.

1010
00:56:00,140 --> 00:56:02,060
Do I risk putting food back in the devices

1011
00:56:02,060 --> 00:56:03,620
I've already destroyed with my biscuits so far

1012
00:56:03,620 --> 00:56:06,660
or do I accept my fate of spitting the evening hungry?

1013
00:56:06,660 --> 00:56:07,860
That's from Starving Student.

1014
00:56:07,860 --> 00:56:09,820
I bet you any amount of money,

1015
00:56:09,820 --> 00:56:13,580
the biscuits come in like a metal lined bag for the oven.

1016
00:56:13,580 --> 00:56:15,860
I bet you any amount of money they microwaved it.

1017
00:56:15,860 --> 00:56:16,700
Any amount.

1018
00:56:16,700 --> 00:56:17,520
That's possible.

1019
00:56:17,520 --> 00:56:18,360
I just love this like, all right,

1020
00:56:18,360 --> 00:56:19,820
so tell me again what happened.

1021
00:56:19,820 --> 00:56:22,680
Yeah, I microwaved the biscuit and it caught fire.

1022
00:56:22,680 --> 00:56:23,520
No, I know.

1023
00:56:23,520 --> 00:56:26,700
But then the second fire, oh, right, right, right.

1024
00:56:26,700 --> 00:56:29,740
What did the second, third, and fourth fires come out of?

1025
00:56:29,740 --> 00:56:32,020
Yes, I used my extremely powerful microwave.

1026
00:56:32,020 --> 00:56:35,140
And my dad is an industrial scientist

1027
00:56:35,140 --> 00:56:36,860
and he gave me one of their industrial microwaves

1028
00:56:36,860 --> 00:56:38,900
for doing industrial stuff.

1029
00:56:38,900 --> 00:56:41,700
The kind that you use to dry out big piles of wet wood.

1030
00:56:41,700 --> 00:56:44,620
Yeah, I just put one of these Cheddar Bay Biscuits in there

1031
00:56:44,620 --> 00:56:47,480
for the normal amount, 45 minutes, and.

1032
00:56:47,480 --> 00:56:51,700
Oh, boy.

1033
00:56:51,700 --> 00:56:55,700
I would do, I would, here's the thing, guys.

1034
00:56:55,700 --> 00:56:59,360
You literally do have to risk it for the biscuit.

1035
00:56:59,360 --> 00:57:00,200
Yep.

1036
00:57:01,540 --> 00:57:04,220
A ship is safe in the harbor,

1037
00:57:04,220 --> 00:57:08,100
but when you take it out to sea, it kicks ass.

1038
00:57:08,100 --> 00:57:11,740
Yep, that's what they say, that old sailor saying.

1039
00:57:11,740 --> 00:57:14,020
I think it would also be perfect if you could time it

1040
00:57:14,020 --> 00:57:16,220
so that the microwave dings two seconds

1041
00:57:16,220 --> 00:57:18,700
after the fire department opens your door.

1042
00:57:18,700 --> 00:57:19,980
And they're just like looking at them like,

1043
00:57:19,980 --> 00:57:22,020
can I get that, because that ramen's

1044
00:57:22,020 --> 00:57:23,900
not gonna eat itself, you guys.

1045
00:57:23,900 --> 00:57:27,620
Oh, yeah, sorry, it was on fire, not the ramen.

1046
00:57:27,620 --> 00:57:28,620
You know what, I'm gonna eat this ramen,

1047
00:57:28,620 --> 00:57:31,300
get out of your way, I'll be in the common room

1048
00:57:31,300 --> 00:57:33,900
watching Bones, because it's always on.

1049
00:57:33,900 --> 00:57:35,260
What's that, I'm arrested?

1050
00:57:35,260 --> 00:57:36,100
That makes sense.

1051
00:57:36,100 --> 00:57:38,580
Oh, no, wait, you're the fire department.

1052
00:57:38,580 --> 00:57:42,420
You can't, you don't have that jurisdiction.

1053
00:57:42,420 --> 00:57:45,460
I bet they do, they have to, for arson and stuff.

1054
00:57:45,460 --> 00:57:46,380
Yeah, I guess.

1055
00:57:46,380 --> 00:57:49,100
Hey, your RA's a dick.

1056
00:57:49,100 --> 00:57:51,180
If I accidentally set a fire in my house

1057
00:57:51,180 --> 00:57:53,180
and then somebody came up to me and was like,

1058
00:57:53,180 --> 00:57:55,700
now sit in your shame.

1059
00:57:55,700 --> 00:57:58,700
It's already an, I know I fucked up.

1060
00:57:58,700 --> 00:58:01,340
I set a fire in the place I sleep in.

1061
00:58:01,340 --> 00:58:02,900
I know I fucked up.

1062
00:58:02,900 --> 00:58:04,820
I don't need the fire department to come say,

1063
00:58:04,820 --> 00:58:07,300
did you know you did a fire where you sleep?

1064
00:58:07,300 --> 00:58:09,380
Thanks, fire guys, I know.

1065
00:58:09,380 --> 00:58:11,620
All fires are illegal.

1066
00:58:11,620 --> 00:58:14,580
And so if you started a fire without their blessing,

1067
00:58:14,580 --> 00:58:16,860
they will come down on you pretty hard.

1068
00:58:16,860 --> 00:58:19,900
Hey, RA, listen, any RA listening,

1069
00:58:19,900 --> 00:58:22,140
this is your chance to score major points.

1070
00:58:22,140 --> 00:58:24,620
Because listen, this person is both embarrassed and hungry.

1071
00:58:24,620 --> 00:58:28,340
You're gonna say, hey, here's five bucks,

1072
00:58:28,340 --> 00:58:31,380
go get some food, I'll take this one, Doug.

1073
00:58:31,380 --> 00:58:34,860
And right there, you're a hero.

1074
00:58:34,860 --> 00:58:39,740
You're a hero to Doug, who, listen,

1075
00:58:39,740 --> 00:58:42,020
question asker is a student, right?

1076
00:58:42,020 --> 00:58:44,340
They're in that, oh, that's so weird transition

1077
00:58:44,340 --> 00:58:46,340
between childhood and adulthood.

1078
00:58:46,340 --> 00:58:49,180
And it's that worst time to tell a fire person

1079
00:58:49,180 --> 00:58:52,460
that you set fire to a cheddar bay biscuit in a microwave.

1080
00:58:52,460 --> 00:58:54,700
A five-year-old does this, it's fine.

1081
00:58:54,700 --> 00:58:56,700
They're fine. It's funny, it's funny.

1082
00:58:56,700 --> 00:58:59,420
A 45-year-old man sets fire to a cheesy biscuit,

1083
00:58:59,420 --> 00:59:01,260
he answers to no one.

1084
00:59:01,260 --> 00:59:04,820
But like a 19-year-old does this, no excuse.

1085
00:59:04,820 --> 00:59:07,700
And you have to answer to someone, the worst.

1086
00:59:08,580 --> 00:59:09,580
The worst.

1087
00:59:09,580 --> 00:59:11,220
I'm sorry, it's hard being young,

1088
00:59:11,220 --> 00:59:13,660
but there's good parts too.

1089
00:59:13,660 --> 00:59:16,420
Like when you don't overcook the cheddar bay biscuit.

1090
00:59:16,420 --> 00:59:18,500
Just cook them right, this is a learning experience.

1091
00:59:18,500 --> 00:59:19,340
I bet you'll never do that again.

1092
00:59:19,340 --> 00:59:20,540
Probably. Yeah.

1093
00:59:20,540 --> 00:59:22,060
But maybe you might.

1094
00:59:23,140 --> 00:59:24,620
You might immediately afterwards,

1095
00:59:24,620 --> 00:59:25,940
according to this question.

1096
00:59:25,940 --> 00:59:26,780
Yeah.

1097
00:59:27,940 --> 00:59:29,740
They've learned nothing.

1098
00:59:29,740 --> 00:59:32,060
Thank you so much for listening to our podcast.

1099
00:59:32,060 --> 00:59:33,660
I hope you've learned something

1100
00:59:33,660 --> 00:59:35,940
throughout the course of this experience,

1101
00:59:35,940 --> 00:59:37,180
or else we haven't done our job.

1102
00:59:37,180 --> 00:59:40,140
Hey, you wanna come, you wanna watch us do a live show?

1103
00:59:40,140 --> 00:59:43,140
Come to your computer, not to a physical location.

1104
00:59:43,140 --> 00:59:46,140
Do you wanna go to a computer or a TV or whatever,

1105
00:59:46,140 --> 00:59:47,460
and watch us do a Taz show?

1106
00:59:47,460 --> 00:59:49,900
We're gonna be doing Hootenanny part three.

1107
00:59:49,900 --> 00:59:51,500
What do we agree on for a title?

1108
00:59:51,500 --> 00:59:53,740
I mean, Hootenanny three is the only thing that makes sense,

1109
00:59:53,740 --> 00:59:56,020
but I do think we landed on Threetnanny.

1110
00:59:56,020 --> 00:59:57,660
Yeah. Threetnanny, okay.

1111
00:59:57,660 --> 00:59:59,580
Threetnanny was just really good and right there,

1112
00:59:59,580 --> 01:00:00,700
and so we had to kind of keep going with it.

1113
01:00:00,700 --> 01:00:02,660
I wanted to call it Threetnanny two,

1114
01:00:02,660 --> 01:00:05,100
but like, I thought that would be confusing.

1115
01:00:05,100 --> 01:00:07,140
There's a space, it's a space cowboy opera.

1116
01:00:07,140 --> 01:00:10,700
It's November 5th, 9 p.m., tickets are 10 bucks.

1117
01:00:10,700 --> 01:00:13,500
It's a bit.ly forward slash Taz virtual,

1118
01:00:13,500 --> 01:00:15,460
and the VOD video on demand.

1119
01:00:15,460 --> 01:00:17,260
It's available for two weeks after the show.

1120
01:00:17,260 --> 01:00:18,780
If you haven't seen Hootenanny,

1121
01:00:18,780 --> 01:00:20,780
there's a recap on our YouTube channel

1122
01:00:20,780 --> 01:00:25,260
to catch you up with the story so far, such as it is,

1123
01:00:25,260 --> 01:00:27,460
and I will be indulging in that.

1124
01:00:27,460 --> 01:00:28,860
Yes, absolutely.

1125
01:00:28,860 --> 01:00:31,340
You will know exactly the things that I know

1126
01:00:31,340 --> 01:00:33,020
about the Hootenanny story.

1127
01:00:33,020 --> 01:00:36,380
Also, very exciting tickets for the shows

1128
01:00:36,380 --> 01:00:39,940
at Emerald City Comic Con go on sale October 28th.

1129
01:00:39,940 --> 01:00:41,460
It's gonna be My Brother, My Brother and Me

1130
01:00:41,460 --> 01:00:45,100
on December 2nd, and Taz on December 3rd.

1131
01:00:45,100 --> 01:00:47,180
Both shows will be general attendance,

1132
01:00:47,180 --> 01:00:48,820
so no assigned seating,

1133
01:00:48,820 --> 01:00:52,740
but there will be ADA-compliant seating available.

1134
01:00:52,740 --> 01:00:55,620
You do not need an Emerald City Comic Con badge

1135
01:00:55,620 --> 01:00:57,500
to buy tickets to the shows,

1136
01:00:57,500 --> 01:00:59,980
but you will need tickets to the shows, obviously,

1137
01:00:59,980 --> 01:01:03,740
and Emerald City Comic Con has safety protocols in place,

1138
01:01:03,740 --> 01:01:06,500
including require proof of full vaccination

1139
01:01:06,500 --> 01:01:09,060
or a recent negative COVID test to attend,

1140
01:01:09,060 --> 01:01:12,540
and in addition, masks are required while on the premises

1141
01:01:12,540 --> 01:01:14,460
and capacity is going to be reduced.

1142
01:01:14,460 --> 01:01:16,780
If you wanna check out more info on the show,

1143
01:01:16,780 --> 01:01:19,580
including the full health and safety protocols,

1144

as well as ticket links and all that stuff,

1145
01:01:21,540 --> 01:01:25,900
it's available at bit.ly slash McElroyTour.

1146
01:01:25,900 --> 01:01:28,900
Thanks to Montaigne for the use of our theme song,

1147
01:01:28,900 --> 01:01:29,980
My Life is Better with You.

1148
01:01:29,980 --> 01:01:33,940
You can find that on the internets

1149
01:01:33,940 --> 01:01:38,940
and on Books A Million, probably has it.

1150
01:01:40,740 --> 01:01:41,900
I don't know about that.

1151
01:01:41,900 --> 01:01:43,340
It's just those two places.

1152
01:01:44,300 --> 01:01:46,100
Make sure you check out macromerch.com,

1153
01:01:46,100 --> 01:01:47,420
get that pin of the month,

1154
01:01:47,420 --> 01:01:51,900
which is Hellraven, AKA Del Craven, from Taz Just Us.

1155
01:01:51,900 --> 01:01:54,060
That benefits the National Latina Institute

1156
01:01:54,060 --> 01:01:55,060
for Reproductive Rights,

1157
01:01:55,060 --> 01:01:56,740
which builds Latina and Latinx power

1158
01:01:56,740 --> 01:01:58,660
to fight for the fundamental human right

1159
01:01:58,660 --> 01:02:01,220
to reproductive health, dignity, and justice.

1160
01:02:01,220 --> 01:02:02,780
There's a lot of other stuff on there.

1161
01:02:02,780 --> 01:02:03,820
In case you missed the news,

1162
01:02:03,820 --> 01:02:06,540
we've been doing Taz Weekly for a while now.

1163
01:02:06,540 --> 01:02:09,300
So this is a good chance to jump in on Ether C.

1164
01:02:09,300 --> 01:02:11,860
And this is the second week of the Max Fun Block Party.

1165
01:02:11,860 --> 01:02:14,740
Maximum Fun is throwing a virtual block party

1166
01:02:14,740 --> 01:02:16,300
through October 22nd.

1167
01:02:16,300 --> 01:02:17,620
All shows are releasing episodes

1168
01:02:17,620 --> 01:02:20,020
that are especially welcoming to new audiences.

1169
01:02:20,020 --> 01:02:21,980
