1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:30,640
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:49,200
Hello, everybody, and welcome to My Brother, My Brother, Me, an advice show for the modern era.

6
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:53,760
I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy. I'm your middle-est brother, Travis McElroy.

7
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:57,920
Happy hump day, weirdos. I'm your sweet baby brother, Griffin McElroy.

8
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:00,080
Okay. It's Wednesday.

9
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:04,000
Oh, okay. But, I mean, not when people are listening to this. So, we got an email

10
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:13,120
to the My Brother, My Brother, Me email from Lydia, and Lydia shared with us a list of 200

11
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:21,200
questions for conversation starters from ConversationStartersWorld.com, and the list

12
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:27,200
is titled Questions to Ask a Guy. And the beginning of the description says,

13
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:31,920
here's a great set of questions to ask a guy to get him talking. They are designed to get

14
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:37,360
an interesting conversation started, but still keep it relatively casual. And folks,

15
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:41,280
these questions are fucking bonkers. Well, this is good, Travis, because

16
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:45,760
we're just three guys being dudes in this show. I know, right?

17
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:51,200
And so, what a better way to get us going, get our sort of talk rocks off,

18
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:56,000
than to just sort of get some convo starties. And you know what? This represents the beginning

19
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,400
of a conversation, doesn't it? Right. And also, at this point,

20
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:01,760
if we're looking to keep the conversation going, we've been going almost 450 episodes,

21
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:05,600
we're starting to run out of things to talk about. So, let me ask you this, question number three,

22
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:09,600
and remember, these are questions designed to keep the conversation going,

23
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:13,280
but keep it relatively casual. For big guys.

24
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:16,320
Yeah. Question number three, you wake up suddenly in the middle of the night,

25
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:18,720
what would be the scariest sound you hear after waking up?

26
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:23,040
Oh, man. When I'm trying to get to know guys, when I'm trying to like, you know,

27
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:27,120
I've joined a football club and I want to get to know the other guys, this is always a good one.

28
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:31,600
We like to bandy this one about. Hey, Theo. Hey, bud. What's the late

29
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:39,680
night terror for you? What's the dark beating heart of the yawning void inside your soul, Theo?

30
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:44,080
Hey, dude, pass me a Sprite and tell me about your greatest fears.

31
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:49,520
I enjoy question 18. Which historical figure wasn't as amazing as most people think they were?

32
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:52,800
Hey, you want to dunk on Ben Franklin with me, Doug?

33
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:55,280
Come on, Buzz. Let's get Abe. It's time.

34
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:00,480
This is the one that I would like us to actually spend some time answering,

35
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:06,080
because this is the one that I think, if you asked a guy to keep the conversation going,

36
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:13,120
this would go totally normal. Question 19, you are in charge of making insects a popular food item.

37
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:17,360
You have one billion US dollars to achieve your goal. How do you do it?

38
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:21,360
Oh, my God. That's actually one of the best conversations I've ever heard in my entire life.

39
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:26,880
Yeah, I walk up to a guy and say this. So it's like, hey, so glad you agreed

40
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:30,160
to come on this blind date with me. Also, you're in charge of making

41
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:35,040
insects a popular food item, and you have one US billion dollars to achieve your goal.

42
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:38,240
How do you do it? Well, I'll tell you,

43
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:42,160
billion bucks buys a lot of marshmallows you can hide bugs inside.

44
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:44,720
Oh, that's good. So that's step one,

45
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:48,480
and I could probably pay some people to get stuffing.

46
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:53,920
Let me be clear, to make bugs a popular food item, you would hide them in marshmallows,

47
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:56,240
and then after like a year of people eating marshmallows, be like,

48
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:59,200
hey, did you like those marshmallows? There were bugs in them.

49
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:03,840
Listen, if things as they are today in 2019 have taught me anything,

50
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:10,560
it's that if you have a billion dollars, you cannot disperse it to people who need it much,

51
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:14,560
much more than you. You have to spend it on space rockets.

52
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:17,360
You have to spend it on bug marshmallows.

53
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:19,360
Bug marshmallows. So yeah, Trav,

54
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:21,840
I think I'm leaning in the right direction on this one.

55
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:25,520
Okay. I'd rebrand everything.

56
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:30,400
I would make it illegal to say roach. I would make it illegal to say moth.

57
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:36,240
I would make it illegal to say mosquito. They would be replaced with Fritos 2.

58
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:38,880
Okay. New nachos.

59
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:44,320
Two. Guy Fieri presents moths.

60
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:48,560
Guy Fieri's Turbo Moths.

61
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:53,040
This is a different plan to bring on celebrities to endorse.

62
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:55,760
I enjoyed that one too, though. I would spend a billion dollars-

63
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:58,720
Guy Fieri's Dangerously Cheesy Moths.

64
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:01,680
Yeah. Pizza-licious roaches.

65
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:06,480
Hugh Grant's Pizza-licious roaches.

66
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:09,200
Hey, it's me, Margot Robbie. Eat a cricket.

67
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:13,520
Oh, I do. I love them.

68
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:19,600
I had to spend a billion dollars hiring crop dusters to fly over bugs and drop.

69
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:22,480
Just get them. Yeah, put some salt on them or something.

70
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:26,480
Make them taste better. And then you're like, they're delicious now.

71
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:33,520
Maybe some kind of viral challenge. Spend a billion dollars getting them.

72
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:36,880
I didn't even think about that. Get them eating bugs for a challenge.

73
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:40,160
The bug eating, the snowpiercer challenge.

74
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:43,120
Gotta get a Netflix sort of movie about it first.

75
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:48,160
So we get Sandra Bullock back for Bird Box 2. This one's called Bug Box.

76
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:55,360
And instead of using the Bird Box as a cudgel to beat the monsters, didn't see it.

77
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:58,240
But people loved it and started to meme it pretty hard.

78
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:01,280
So in this one, it's a box full of bugs, but she opens it up and she's like,

79
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:05,120
oh, actually these look delicious. Are these covered in pizza dust?

80
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:08,240
And Guy Fieri pokes out and he's like, yeah. And then the monster gets him,

81
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:10,720
but she eats them and now Bob's your uncle.

82
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:12,640
Teen's gotta eat this for their Snapchat story.

83
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:15,040
I got a way to force everybody to eat bugs.

84
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:15,760
All right.

85
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:21,040
Just wait. Just wait. Well, it'll happen.

86
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:24,400
We're gonna get there. There's no need to rush.

87
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:27,280
We're all gonna be eating bugs here before too long.

88
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:30,400
Let's not rush it. Let's just enjoy bread while we got it.

89
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:36,640
Justin with that extremely specific Alex Jones sort of stuff that he's dropping.

90
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:41,760
And you know what? That's fine. It's dense protein and fuck bugs.

91
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:43,520
Yeah. That's good bugs.

92
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:49,840
And also people all over the world that just aren't right here are eating them already.

93
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:54,240
Yeah. They're like, pass the bugs over here.

94
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:57,680
They're afraid that we're gonna find out about bugs.

95
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:59,280
How good bugs are.

96
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:00,160
Yeah.

97
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:02,000
And good for you. God.

98
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,680
And if you watch Shark Tank, half of things are bugs now.

99
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:09,120
If you watch Shark Tank, half of all food products do have bugs in them.

100
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:11,600
Yeah. Bugs is good.

101
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:14,080
I feel like I've talked about this on the show more than once,

102
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:16,880
but I see the Hakuna Matata scene where they ate the big fat grubs.

103
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:20,560
And I've always found that scene incredibly inexplicably appetizing.

104
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:25,200
I want to eat the grubby bug that has the juice that comes out of it because I want to know.

105
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:28,400
They eat them like it's a women's sampler.

106
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:29,680
And it looks so good.

107
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:32,400
When he sucks the big one down.

108
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:34,080
When he sucks that big one.

109
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:37,600
He sucks that big one down and it looks so just like plump and rising.

110
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:39,920
It's just like, I want to know maybe.

111
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:44,320
We often struggle with how to pitch our podcast to people.

112
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:50,720
I think from now on, it would be easiest to say it's the sort of show

113
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:54,880
where my brother Griffin has had more than one opportunity

114
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:58,800
to talk about how delicious he thinks the bugs in Lion King look.

115
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:01,440
Yep. So it's that kind of program.

116
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:07,280
Well, in my defense, they give you, I believe, yelling energy in the Lion King video game.

117
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:07,760
Correct.

118
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:09,840
So I feel a sort of attachment or health.

119
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:11,520
It's either health or yelling energy.

120
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:14,960
And second of all, if they start to get on my case about that,

121
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:17,520
good thing that scene has a little message

122
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:20,560
that will help me get through the strife that that will cause.

123
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:22,640
What is that message?

124
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:24,400
You know what it is.

125
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:29,680
It's trademark, but it rhymes with hakuda mabada.

126
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:32,080
It doesn't actually.

127
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:33,920
It kind of does.

128
00:08:33,920 --> 00:08:34,320
Okay.

129
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:36,720
Raccoona.

130
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:41,280
Chabata.

131
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:41,840
Chabata.

132
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:46,000
Raccoona chabata.

133
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,680
Draguna chubaca.

134
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:53,760
Fetsuna frittata.

135
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:57,120
Dragoon chubaca is my favorite character in Kingdom Hearts 3.

136
00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:00,000
Kingdom Hearts 3 is out, and I'd love to talk about it.

137
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,520
We can't keep dipping in.

138
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:02,400
We can't keep dipping in.

139
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:06,480
I've been told I'm not allowed to, but boy, Siri wants to get in.

140
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:12,000
Siri just thinks I said to it, Kingdom Hearts 3 is out, and I love it.

141
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:17,760
Oh man, I hope Google and Siri and all that shit aren't listening

142
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:19,920
because I just fucked my whole thing.

143
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:22,800
My whole internet ad thing is ruined.

144
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:28,160
Tim Cook, while sitting on his Sora, Riku, Kairi bedspread,

145
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:32,080
just got a notification on his computer, and he's like, ah, good.

146
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:32,720
We got him.

147
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:33,440
We got him.

148
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:38,320
Hey, don't fucking give me a link to that great Reply All episode

149
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:40,720
about how those things aren't listening to us.

150
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:42,080
Please, please.

151
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:42,720
I heard it.

152
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:43,200
It's great.

153
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:43,520
I get it.

154
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:44,320
It was just a joke.

155
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:44,880
Damn.

156
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:46,240
God, it was just a joke.

157
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:47,920
Yeah, you really looked eastward there.

158
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:48,960
Hey, let's do show.

159
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:50,960
Let's do show.

160
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:52,960
It's an advice show.

161
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:55,840
Recently, my best friend's parents, who I am not that close to-

162
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:57,040
Fuck you, Marjorie.

163
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:57,360
Boom.

164
00:09:58,080 --> 00:09:58,800
Boom.

165
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:00,640
You thought we were friends, but we ain't.

166
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:02,800
Doug, Marjorie, eat my ass.

167
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:03,600
What's up?

168
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:05,840
No, I will not give you a ride to the airport.

169
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:07,040
Fuck off.

170
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:08,160
Let me finish, please.

171
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:08,800
Sorry.

172
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:11,680
Invited me over for a dinner of pizza and chicken wings

173
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:14,240
before I would be house-sitting for them.

174
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:17,120
Please, everybody, it's hard enough for you to read.

175
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:20,160
Stop wording things in the weirdest possible way.

176
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:22,640
I will have a dinner of pizza and chicken wings.

177
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:26,960
Present to me, Krogan, a dinner of pizza

178
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:28,720
before I would be house-

179
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:31,120
Okay, a dinner of pizza and chicken wings

180
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:33,120
before I would be house-sitting for them.

181
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:35,920
Partway through the meal, my friend's mom said,

182
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:39,040
oh, hang on, fished a fork out of the drawer

183
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:42,880
and handed it to me and said, for the wings.

184
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:43,440
This is fake.

185
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:46,080
Fake question duped again.

186
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:46,880
Duped again.

187
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:48,800
You almost got one by the McElroy boys,

188
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:52,000
but we weren't born, I was born during the day,

189
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,320
but not during, but not yesterday.

190
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:55,120
So next question.

191
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:55,600
Is this a fake?

192
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:56,160
Next question.

193
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:57,840
This is a fake?

194
00:10:57,840 --> 00:10:59,360
Scoop this one in the garbage can, yeah.

195
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:02,240
Wait, why are you so sure?

196
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:03,440
Scoop it right in the garbage can.

197
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:05,360
This person doesn't exist, no way.

198
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:06,480
Fork winger, no way.

199
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:07,920
Out the window at this point.

200
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:09,520
Debra fork winger, get out of here.

201
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:12,000
Dump this one in the front yard.

202
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,400
Let it fertilize the roses, no way.

203
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:17,520
A wing forker, stop it.

204
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:19,280
Not wanting to be rude, I took it,

205
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:21,440
but not understanding how she wanted me to use it

206
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:23,200
and seeing as no one else was using one,

207
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:26,000
I sort of awkwardly placed it on my napkin.

208
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,400
For the rest of the meal, I became increasingly paranoid.

209
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:30,240
She was noticing me not using the fork.

210
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:34,640
And then I was being very rude by not doing so,

211
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:36,160
despite me being completely bewildered

212
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:38,000
as to how to use a fork for a chicken wing.

213
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:40,320
Brothers, why did she give me the fork?

214
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:43,520
Is there some new fork technique I did not get told about?

215
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:45,200
They've done it.

216
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:46,480
They've cracked it.

217
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:48,960
What should I have done in this situation

218
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:50,640
to avoid offending my hosts?

219
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:53,680
That's fork faux pas in California.

220
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:55,440
There's a few possibilities here,

221
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:58,320
and I'm gonna give you one from my files,

222
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:00,240
from the J files we call them.

223
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:06,640
When I am eating the flats,

224
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:09,600
not the drums, but the flaties.

225
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:11,440
When I'm eating the flaties,

226
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:15,680
sometimes I'll get a little bit,

227
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:18,960
there'll be a little bit of that succulent chicken

228
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:22,160
in between the two bones that make up the flat.

229
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:24,800
Which is rude of the chicken to hide its meat in there.

230
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:27,360
Hide that delicious meat for yourself.

231
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:31,040
So sometimes I'll stick my tongue in there

232
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:33,360
like that to jam it out.

233
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:36,400
So the reason why I'm saying this

234
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:39,280
is that I'm just realizing it at the moment

235
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:42,160
that that visual palette that I would be presenting there

236
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:44,400
would be challenging at best.

237
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:47,200
Especially since you are not that close to it.

238
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:49,920
So they have not seen this display before now.

239
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:52,640
It's possible that it's just an inbuilt genetic thing

240
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:54,800
that some rowdy folks do.

241
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:57,920
If you maybe pulled this stunt,

242
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:00,480
I think that maybe they observed it.

243
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:02,320
Maybe if they observed the stunt,

244
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:03,520
they might say like,

245
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:06,880
actually we're gonna go ahead and get you a fork.

246
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:08,000
Cause we can't,

247
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:10,000
cause it's Sunday,

248
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,280
we just got back from church

249
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:13,200
and you're doing wing-a-lingus over here.

250
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:15,360
Kind of wing-us.

251
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:22,560
Was it a special like tiny,

252
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:25,840
like a shrimp fork for wings?

253
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:27,600
Now that could be useful.

254
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:28,880
I would love that.

255
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:30,560
I would hope they would mention it's a shrimp fork

256
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:32,160
if it was a fucking shrimp fork.

257
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:32,800
Wowzers.

258
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:33,040
Yeah.

259
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:35,120
I mean, you probably had some ragged action on your eating

260
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:37,680
and the fact that she didn't offer it to anybody else

261
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:38,800
means that you did the worst job

262
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:40,320
of eating the wings at the table.

263
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:42,320
And you can't take that personally,

264
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:43,760
but there's lots of YouTube tutorials

265
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:45,120
about how to do it good.

266
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:46,720
And don't be ashamed to ask for help.

267
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:48,720
Maybe it was just-

268
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:49,600
The big game coming,

269
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:51,040
oh shit, this is gonna be after the big game.

270
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:52,640
Well, you'll catch it 2020 probably.

271
00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:53,200
Yeah.

272
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:55,120
Or maybe you'll watch a re-watch,

273
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:57,920
like maybe you like videotaped the big game.

274
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:00,000
Hopefully by then football will have been outlawed.

275
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,680
Hopefully, fingers crossed.

276
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:04,480
Now it's possible that maybe this is just a matter

277
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:06,240
of like the parents,

278
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:10,080
they love each other and they love your friend,

279
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:11,680
but they're not sure on you yet.

280
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:13,120
So if parents or friends,

281
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:16,160
if family members got wing stains on the table,

282
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:17,440
they can forgive that.

283
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:20,480
But if you wing stain the tablecloth,

284
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:24,800
they might like then not trust you to then house it

285
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:26,800
and they have to cancel their vacation.

286
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:30,480
So this might just be like a defense mechanism

287
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:33,680
so that you don't ruin their trip to like,

288
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:36,640
I don't know, to Barbados or wherever they're going.

289
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:37,520
Where are they going?

290
00:14:37,520 --> 00:14:39,680
Why didn't you include that in the question?

291
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:40,960
This is important data that I need to know.

292
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:41,920
No, it's not.

293
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:43,440
Are you the only one who potentially

294
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:46,000
did not get bone full wings?

295
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,240
And in fact would find your wings to be bone less.

296
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:50,800
And so by eating those with your hands,

297
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:51,840
you're a wild animal.

298
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:52,880
Wait, why is that, Griffin?

299
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:54,400
That seems like a double standard.

300
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:55,760
I've made it easier to eat

301
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:58,080
and therefore now I have to introduce utensils?

302
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:00,240
Yeah, yeah.

303
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:02,480
Hey folks, folks aren't out there eating.

304
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:02,960
Wow, huh?

305
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:04,480
This is a double standard though.

306
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:06,480
I will eat a wing wing with my hands.

307
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:09,600
And you know, using Justin's technique,

308
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:11,520
sometimes my tongue and my heart.

309
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:15,280
But in a chicken tender,

310
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:16,720
you know I'm gonna hand that one.

311
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:19,200
That one's getting handed and dippid and mouthed.

312
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:23,920
But a buffalo, a boneless guy, a buffalo wing,

313
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:25,680
if you eat that with your hands,

314
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:27,120
you're a dog in the street.

315
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:31,360
It's just a small tender or,

316
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:35,120
you know, the bone full wings flop of your cousin.

317
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:36,800
Why can't I eat that with my hands?

318
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:40,560
Mm, what about like popcorn chicken?

319
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:42,000
Popcorn chicken's hand, of course.

320
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:42,960
If you eat that with a fork,

321
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:44,400
you're out of your gourd, man.

322
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:47,680
Right, so why is it just the boneless wing

323
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:50,000
with the whole game done changed?

324
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,480
Yeah, well we helped them enough.

325
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:53,600
How about a yahoo?

326
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:54,720
Okay, I love that, Griffin.

327
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:56,080
This one was sent in by Sid Ross.

328
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:57,360
Sid sent a bunch of great ones in.

329
00:15:57,360 --> 00:15:57,840
Thank you, Sid.

330
00:15:57,840 --> 00:15:59,360
It's an anonymous yahoo answers user

331
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:02,640
who I'm gonna call the Quaker Oats guy.

332
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:05,200
Looking at him, he looks regal, regal beagle.

333
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:07,120
Cool, Quaker Oats guy asks.

334
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:09,920
Is there an ad for Quaker Oats on your desktop right now?

335
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:11,200
Like on the screen, or?

336
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:12,400
No, it's just my desktop background

337
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:13,440
is an ad for Quaker Oats.

338
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:14,080
I just love them.

339
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:14,960
I love these guys.

340
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:17,920
So Quaker Oats guy asks,

341
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:21,040
and this is like, this is almost a riddle me piss.

342
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:24,080
It's 1246 a.m.

343
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:30,480
Is it too early slash late in the day to make tortellini?

344
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:31,120
I gotta know.

345
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:36,480
It's 1246 a.m.

346
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:38,000
And to answer this one,

347
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:43,120
we really have to look at the whole sort of clock

348
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:46,480
using 1246 as like the fulcrum of it

349
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:49,200
and try to figure out is it,

350
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:54,160
it's almost certainly too early for pasta time.

351
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:58,480
But yeah, no one's making pasta at least,

352
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:01,200
you wake up at 630 at the earliest

353
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:02,640
and maybe start chowing down on pasta,

354
00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:05,200
that seems weird, but you've made it now.

355
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:07,840
Six hours in advance, it's gonna be not great.

356
00:17:07,840 --> 00:17:09,520
I think it's definitely too early in the day

357
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:10,400
to have tortellini,

358
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:12,800
but I guess it's, again, a question of perspective.

359
00:17:13,680 --> 00:17:18,160
Tortellini, what kind of stuffing

360
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:20,320
are we talking about with this tortellini?

361
00:17:20,320 --> 00:17:25,760
Because it seems like if you got maybe egg

362
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:29,040
or maybe bacon,

363
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:33,840
you might have yourself a kind of a breakfast tortellini.

364
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:36,800
Now, Justin, I would argue that the stuffing

365
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:38,400
does not change the fact

366
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:41,360
that this would still be about six hours

367
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:43,920
before you could justifiably have breakfast.

368
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:47,200
Yep, I mean, Saturday Night Live just ended.

369
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:51,760
I'm real horny, gotta work this off

370
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:54,000
by making my own tortellini

371
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,680
and stuffing it with breakfast.

372
00:17:55,680 --> 00:17:57,200
Wait, are you making it from scratch?

373
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:59,200
I assume this is like a frozen scenario,

374
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:00,960
perhaps a refrigerated scenario.

375
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:03,760
You're like cranking out the dough and everything?

376
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:06,160
What time was it?

377
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:09,760
1246 a.m., I'm horny as hell.

378
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:13,280
SNL just ended, had me a good belly laugh at that one.

379
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:16,160
And I need a way to work out these jimmies.

380
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:18,720
Well, now, I don't know how long it takes

381
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:20,000
to make tortellini from scratch.

382
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,560
1246 might be the right time to start

383
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:24,320
if you wanna have it for lunch the next day.

384
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:25,440
It doesn't take a lot.

385
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:28,720
Any pastas are very quick, they come together quick.

386
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:30,000
You put them in the machine.

387
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,760
No, you're making it from scratch, my man.

388
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:33,760
From scratch, you come together quick,

389
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:34,240
you put it in the machine.

390
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:35,200
You don't know.

391
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:36,640
You start to get the ingredients,

392
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:40,560
you put it in the machine, you fold it into shapes,

393
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:43,120
you wrap it around stuffing, you crimp.

394
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:45,280
And now it's 6.30 a.m.

395
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:48,560
If you're on the way, you get the deep fat fryer going,

396
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:51,600
and then throw it all in the trash

397
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:52,640
and go to Olive Garden

398
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:54,400
because you don't know how to make it.

399
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:58,000
Tortellini certainly seems like maybe

400
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,680
one of the more challenging pastas

401
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:01,760
to try to make from scratch yourself.

402
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:07,600
Anything full, it's gonna be tough.

403
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:10,000
But it's fun because if you get bored of eating it,

404
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:13,360
you can pick them up and use them as little rings.

405
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:14,480
I used to do that when I was a kid.

406
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:16,400
I'd have little tortellini rings

407
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:18,160
and everyone thought it was really cute.

408
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:20,320
Oh shit, this is a trick question.

409
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:20,800
Oh.

410
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:21,680
Okay.

411
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:25,680
This person works a shift where they go into work

412
00:19:26,560 --> 00:19:30,400
like 4 a.m. to noon,

413
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:36,640
and so 12 for them is like their breakfast.

414
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:38,800
They're having, that's brunch.

415
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:41,520
Yeah, and the other possibility here-

416
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:42,720
Postability, please.

417
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:44,960
The other possibility here, thank you Travis,

418
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:45,920
my brilliant brother,

419
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:49,520
is that once you reach a certain age,

420
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:50,640
you can do whatever the fuck you want,

421
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:52,000
whenever the fuck you want to.

422
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,240
So you can do this,

423
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:55,360
but you need some sort of,

424
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:57,840
all you have to do to justify this,

425
00:19:57,840 --> 00:19:59,520
the only person you have to justify this to

426
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:01,760
is you, yourself,

427
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:03,600
and the Holy Spirit that dwells within you.

428
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:05,280
Because that's the end of the day,

429
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:07,360
you just gotta be able to fall asleep after this

430
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:11,440
at 2.15 a.m. after you've made and consumed the tortellini.

431
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:12,640
If you just treat it like,

432
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:14,800
okay, so I had dinner,

433
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:16,880
and then SNL started up,

434
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:17,920
but during commercial break,

435
00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:20,480
I jetted on down to Taco Bell for fourth meal,

436
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:21,360
and as everybody knows,

437
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:24,240
the traditional fifth meal is a homemade pasta

438
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:25,040
that you made yourself.

439
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:27,200
It's half a serving of tortellini.

440
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:29,520
You don't need a full serving, come on.

441
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:30,560
We're not getting silly here.

442
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:34,160
This is, can I say, Griffin, to your point?

443
00:20:34,160 --> 00:20:34,720
Thank you.

444
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:38,000
You reach a certain age where you can eat

445
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,480
and do whatever you want whenever you want,

446
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:42,880
but your body begins to reject it

447
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:46,320
in a way that I feel is like inverse and unfair.

448
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:47,440
Yeah.

449
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:48,560
When I'm a child,

450
00:20:48,560 --> 00:20:51,360
I could have eaten ice cream every meal,

451
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:52,720
three to four meals in a day,

452
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:54,080
but I was not allowed to.

453
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:55,360
But now at 35,

454
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:58,640
if I do that in one day, I'll die.

455
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:00,640
Yeah, when I was a kid,

456
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:03,200
I would pack three packs of Gushers for my lunch,

457
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:04,640
and Dad would see that and say,

458
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:05,200
no, you don't.

459
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:07,760
And now that I'm an adult,

460
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:09,280
it's like my body is my dad.

461
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:14,480
My favorite John Mayer song.

462
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:16,320
Is that what dad bod means?

463
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:22,400
As long as you live under my skin,

464
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:24,080
you'll obey my rules.

465
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:25,360
Hey, young man.

466
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:26,160
It's kind of like,

467
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:28,240
it's kind of like Krang, Griffin.

468
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:30,320
The brain that lives in your belly

469
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:32,640
pilots the entire operation.

470
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:33,680
That's kind of what you're feeling.

471
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:36,160
Yes, but it would be like if the rest of Krang was like,

472
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:37,920
I think I'd like pizza tonight.

473
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:38,640
And Krang was like,

474
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:40,800
we'll be up all night with Hi-Bang.

475
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:43,840
You don't think that that shell

476
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:46,880
that Krang rode around in did want pizza?

477
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:47,840
That thing looked,

478
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:49,840
nothing has ever looked like it wanted pizza

479
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:51,120
more than Krang's body.

480
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:55,680
That shell suit is maybe the saddest character

481
00:21:55,680 --> 00:21:58,640
in all of television ever.

482
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:00,560
He didn't ever get to do anything he wanted.

483
00:22:00,560 --> 00:22:01,440
He wanted to hang out with,

484
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:03,440
maybe he liked the turtles.

485
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:07,280
He liked their flips and their pizza.

486
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:08,880
And he had to fight against them.

487
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:09,680
That's sad.

488
00:22:09,680 --> 00:22:11,600
Did those cowards ever put Krang in a movie?

489
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:13,440
I'm gonna say no,

490
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:14,400
because he would have looked,

491
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:15,600
if you're talking live action,

492
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:17,040
he would have looked like a shaved scrotum.

493
00:22:17,040 --> 00:22:18,320
And I think I'd remember that.

494
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:20,400
Yeah, like tummy nuts.

495
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:22,160
Here's a quick update.

496
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:23,520
Quick update.

497
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:27,760
He appears in Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles 2

498
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:31,200
and he is voiced by Brad Garrett.

499
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:36,000
The perfect person.

500
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:40,240
One person I hope would play Krang.

501
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:43,360
And Ray Romano does the body's voice.

502
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:46,320
Ah, you're a traitor.

503
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:50,080
Traitor, traitor.

504
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:52,240
I have had this problem for a long time

505
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:53,600
and I can't get it to end.

506
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:55,920
People ask me for directions constantly.

507
00:22:55,920 --> 00:22:57,200
I'm not over exaggerating.

508
00:22:57,200 --> 00:22:58,480
No matter where I am or what I'm doing,

509
00:22:58,480 --> 00:22:59,920
some stranger will do their best to flag me

510
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:01,440
and ask for directions.

511
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:03,920
I've had a mother pull over to the side of the road,

512
00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:04,800
children in the car,

513
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:06,400
window rolled down to ask me for help.

514
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:08,960
I've, why?

515
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:11,280
Okay, I've had people basically run me down

516
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:12,880
in the pouring rain for directions.

517
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:15,040
I've tried wearing noise canceling headphones.

518
00:23:15,040 --> 00:23:16,800
I even tried walking with less confidence,

519
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:18,080
but none of it helps.

520
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:19,280
I've been told by my friends

521
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:21,360
that my resting face looks pissed off.

522
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:23,520
So why does every person in the world

523
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:25,520
want to ask you where the bathroom is?

524
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:27,040
How do I make this stop?

525
00:23:27,040 --> 00:23:28,080
Is it impossible?

526
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:28,880
Help.

527
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:30,400
Sincerely, the Minotaur.

528
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:35,840
No, sorry, I misread it.

529
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:37,360
For Ava in Lake Forest.

530
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:39,840
Yeah, I used to think,

531
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:42,960
so I kind of get where this person's coming from

532
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:44,160
because I used to think

533
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:47,920
that I had some sort of weird power

534
00:23:47,920 --> 00:23:51,120
that in public people would just want me

535
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:55,680
to take their phone or camera and take their picture.

536
00:23:55,680 --> 00:23:56,400
Like we would be,

537
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:58,880
I remember one time we were walking around in Central Park

538
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:01,920
and like I got stopped like five different times

539
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:03,440
so that some couple,

540
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:04,160
they would like hand me their phone

541
00:24:04,160 --> 00:24:05,760
and be like, can you take a picture of us?

542
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:06,960
And it happened to me so much

543
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:09,360
I started to think that there was some sort of weird

544
00:24:10,560 --> 00:24:13,680
like Truman Show shit going on.

545
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:15,860
Normally.

546
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:18,880
And then what happened, Griffin?

547
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:22,560
Well, and then my boat smashed through the wall

548
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:24,960
and who was back there?

549
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:25,920
My real wife.

550
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:28,160
Brad Garrett.

551
00:24:29,680 --> 00:24:31,360
Brad Garrett, my real wife.

552
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:34,560
Now normally I would chastise this person

553
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:38,560
because I feel like people coming up to you,

554
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:40,800
I don't know, where I'm at in my life,

555
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:41,920
this isn't for everybody,

556
00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:44,480
but like it feels like a mitzvah, right?

557
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:47,680
It feels like you have this opportunity to help people

558
00:24:47,680 --> 00:24:50,480
and that's like a sort of blessing.

559
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:52,800
You should be happy that you can help somebody.

560
00:24:53,920 --> 00:24:59,200
One of like the only areas in which I cannot accept

561
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:01,600
it is in fact giving directions.

562
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:03,680
I couldn't give anyone directions.

563
00:25:03,680 --> 00:25:06,400
People ask me directions to my home

564
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:08,400
who are coming to like deliver something

565
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:09,680
and I can't help them.

566
00:25:09,680 --> 00:25:10,960
I don't know what to tell them.

567
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:14,080
Like just the phone took that from me.

568
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:16,160
I don't have that anymore, okay?

569
00:25:16,160 --> 00:25:17,040
The phone took that.

570
00:25:17,040 --> 00:25:18,320
I don't know what anything is.

571
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:20,240
And you should have a phone too and I know you do.

572
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:22,560
This is a fun test.

573
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:28,240
I don't know what the street that feeds into my street is called.

574
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:32,560
I don't know what the street that goes into my street is called.

575
00:25:32,560 --> 00:25:33,440
I don't know what that is.

576
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:35,280
I don't know what its name is, which isn't great.

577
00:25:35,280 --> 00:25:37,040
I don't think I do either.

578
00:25:37,040 --> 00:25:37,360
That's not great, boys.

579
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:38,800
If someone asks me for directions,

580
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:42,480
if they're not starting from my house,

581
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:44,160
I don't know what to tell them.

582
00:25:44,160 --> 00:25:46,080
Like, okay, first come to my house

583
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:48,800
and now I can tell you how to get to the store from there.

584
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:49,760
I get this a lot.

585
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:52,800
I think maybe it's because I've worked so many retail jobs,

586
00:25:52,800 --> 00:25:55,520
but I give off a vibe whenever I'm in a store,

587
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:58,240
I think that I know where stuff is in the store.

588
00:25:58,240 --> 00:26:01,200
I get asked that like if I'm at Home Depot or Kroger

589
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:04,240
or whatever, people will stop me and ask me specifically

590
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:05,760
if I know where things are.

591
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:07,120
You look like a shop boy.

592
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:08,000
I do.

593
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,720
I do look like, you know, I wear a lot of polos.

594
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:11,840
So I get it.

595
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:13,360
I get polos and khakis.

596
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:14,960
Everyone knows that's my go-to look.

597
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:16,880
This is why I wear tank tops, guys.

598
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:20,800
People are only gonna ask you directions to one thing

599
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:22,320
and that's the bar.

600
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:25,040
Or a gun show.

601
00:26:25,040 --> 00:26:25,760
Or a gun show.

602
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:26,720
Or a party.

603
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:29,120
A gun show would be, yeah.

604
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:32,080
No, it's not a real gun show, Juice.

605
00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:33,200
Talking about my big arms.

606
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:34,640
Yeah, because your big arms.

607
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:35,440
Okay.

608
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:36,160
Yeah, it was good.

609
00:26:38,560 --> 00:26:41,040
Hold on, I'm writing a note to myself about the good joke

610
00:26:41,040 --> 00:26:41,520
you did.

611
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:42,480
It was a good joke.

612
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:43,280
Who needs guns?

613
00:26:43,280 --> 00:26:48,080
I have these big arms and then I would cock my bicep

614
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:49,440
like it was like a gun.

615
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:52,240
You would like break your arm?

616
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:56,160
Yeah, I bend it 90 degrees, but then I bend it right back.

617
00:26:56,160 --> 00:26:59,440
And then what comes out of my elbow?

618
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:00,240
A little cannon.

619
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:04,720
A lead a battle angel too.

620
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:06,160
Griffin is him.

621
00:27:06,160 --> 00:27:09,200
Hey, what's going on with that fucking clip?

622
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:10,240
Yo, Robert.

623
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:10,960
Hey, Robert.

624
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:15,520
Hey, I've been seeing commercials and it kind of looks

625
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:17,920
like those, you know, there's like we turn the Simpsons

626
00:27:17,920 --> 00:27:19,920
into real people and this is what it looks like.

627
00:27:20,560 --> 00:27:22,640
It's kind of like that and I don't think that movie

628
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:24,240
should be allowed to come out.

629
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:27,120
No one asked me about it and I just am not sure that

630
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:28,720
it should come out because I've been seeing a lot of

631
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:30,160
pictures from it, Rob.

632
00:27:30,160 --> 00:27:32,400
And I'm just not sure, but I don't know.

633
00:27:33,280 --> 00:27:34,800
Well, there goes that sponsorship.

634
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,440
Let's try with the other ones, I guess.

635
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:50,800
I just hopped on Rotten Tomatoes to see if the

636
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:52,000
Alita was getting scores yet.

637
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,160
There's a movie coming out called What Men Want.

638
00:27:54,160 --> 00:27:55,680
With Taraji P. Henson.

639
00:27:55,680 --> 00:27:57,360
Yeah, that looks cool.

640
00:27:57,360 --> 00:27:59,360
I wonder how many of these great questions it's going

641
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:00,240
to have in it.

642
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:01,840
How many of these great icebreakers.

643
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:03,600
Probably a lot.

644
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:06,400
If you could design a tree house, what would it look

645
00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:07,360
like, that kind of thing.

646
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:10,240
You know what would be in my tree house?

647
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:10,720
Go for it.

648
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:11,120
What's that?

649
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:13,360
A Casper mattress.

650
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:14,400
Okay.

651
00:28:15,280 --> 00:28:17,120
And listen, I know you're saying, Travis, how would

652
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:18,720
you get a mattress of a tree?

653
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:21,920
It would be easy because one, I'd have a really cool

654
00:28:21,920 --> 00:28:22,720
pulley system.

655
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:24,560
It would be very Swiss Family Robinson.

656
00:28:24,560 --> 00:28:27,200
But also, they come in boxes and then you cut them

657
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:30,800
open and it goes, and becomes a full size mattress

658
00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:34,400
like the raft in Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom.

659
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:36,800
So that's cool.

660
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:37,360
Very cool.

661
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:39,600
Also, they're incredibly comfortable.

662
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:41,680
I notice whenever we tour or travel or whatever and

663
00:28:41,680 --> 00:28:44,000
I sleep on a mattress that isn't my Casper mattress,

664
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:47,840
I legitimately notice a decrease in the quality of

665
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:48,320
my sleep.

666
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:51,200
And they have free shipping and returns in the US

667
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:54,400
and Canada and no hassle returns.

668
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:59,040
So you can be sure of your purchase with Casper's 100

669
00:28:59,040 --> 00:29:01,520
night risk free sleep on it trial.

670
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:03,840
So you can sleep on it for 100 nights and then on

671
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:06,080
like night 100 be like, no, you know what?

672
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:06,880
Forget this.

673
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:07,760
And you can send it back.

674
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:08,480
No hassle.

675
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:09,280
But don't do it.

676
00:29:09,280 --> 00:29:09,920
That's messed up.

677
00:29:09,920 --> 00:29:10,720
Don't do it.

678
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:11,360
No, don't do it.

679
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:11,920
Don't do this.

680
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:15,120

one of these bad boys.

Yeah, when talking about a 400% increase at least

one of the Hemsworths has slept on this mattress

694

before it got to you.

695
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:53,280
Hey, Federal Communications Commission.

696
00:29:53,840 --> 00:29:55,200
That's a Travis macro guarantee.

697
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:56,000
It's not legally binding.

698
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:57,360
Federal Communications Commission.

699
00:29:57,360 --> 00:29:58,400
You're listening to this one now.

700
00:29:58,400 --> 00:29:58,880
What's up?

701
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:00,080
It's a goose.

702
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:02,240
You know what?

703
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:06,640
If the SEC fined us for you guaranteeing 400% increase

704
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:10,160
in wet dreams, I would wear that fine like a badge of honor.

705
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:13,440
Stitch Fix.

706
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:15,120
I'm not going to lie about Stitch Fix.

707
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:16,480
I'm only going to say true things.

708
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:21,200
But every single article of clothing I've ever received

709
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:24,160
from them has a retail price of $15,000.

710
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:27,920
And I don't know how they're selling it to me for

711
00:30:27,920 --> 00:30:29,360
they all cost seven cents.

712
00:30:29,920 --> 00:30:31,040
And it seems to me.

713
00:30:31,040 --> 00:30:31,520
Oh, Justin.

714
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:32,160
Oh, Justin.

715
00:30:32,160 --> 00:30:33,440
This one feels bad.

716
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:34,720
No, it's not true.

717
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:35,200
Hold on.

718
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:40,720
If you would like to start filling out your wardrobe,

719
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:43,520
but you're bad at picking out clothes, I get it.

720
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:45,680
I've known a lot of people like that.

721
00:30:45,680 --> 00:30:46,800
People like that.

722
00:30:46,800 --> 00:30:54,080
But you don't have to live like a sloppy boy or girl

723
00:30:54,080 --> 00:30:58,960
or non-gender binary adhering individual any longer.

724
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:01,440
No, you can turn to Stitch Fix.

725
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:03,680
You're going to give them your measurements,

726
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:06,080
can tell them a little bit about some of the environments

727
00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:08,240
you find yourself in your day to day,

728
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:10,400
and then they're going to get you some looks.

729
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:12,400
And you're going to tell them what you think about those looks.

730
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:14,000
Keep only the ones that you like.

731
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,480
And those are the only ones that you are going to be paying for.

732
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:19,680
And then your stylist, your personal stylist,

733
00:31:19,680 --> 00:31:22,480
is going to get feedback about what you like and don't like.

734
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:25,200
In that next box, it's going to be even better.

735
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:27,760
And so on and so forth.

736
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:29,520
The ones you don't like, by the way,

737
00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:31,520
you can exchange and return those.

738
00:31:31,520 --> 00:31:32,720
It's always free.

739
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:34,720
There's no shipping fee.

740
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:38,480
And there's the styling fee, the fee for your own personal stylist.

741
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:39,760
It's only 20 bucks.

742
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:42,720
And that gets applied towards anything you keep from your shipment.

743
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:45,200
So like, no worries.

Stitchfix.com slash my brother.

749
00:32:03,280 --> 00:32:04,560
Can we just do a quick stitch check?

750
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:08,080
My pants stitch, my shirt stitch.

751
00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:13,040
My pants are stitch and my over sweater is stitch.

752
00:32:13,040 --> 00:32:16,960
My jeans are stitch and my shirt says

753
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:18,720
Hills is where the toys are.

754
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:19,920
Didn't get it from stitch.

755
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:21,680
Oh wait, can we go back?

756
00:32:21,680 --> 00:32:24,800
My pants are stitch and my tiny blue alien is stitch.

757
00:32:25,520 --> 00:32:26,240
Great, Trav.

758
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:27,520
That's just good.

759
00:32:27,520 --> 00:32:27,920
Thank you.

760
00:32:27,920 --> 00:32:28,800
That's just good.

761
00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:29,840
Okay.

762
00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:31,440
I'm glad we went back to pick that up.

763
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:33,360
I would have felt terrible for days.

764
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:34,960
Moving on.

765
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:37,680
Not all heroes wear capes.

766
00:32:37,680 --> 00:32:40,400
Some heroes watch war movies and then review them.

767
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:44,320
Friendly Fire is a war movie podcast

768
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:47,120
for people who don't necessarily like war movies,

769
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:50,400
although it does not exclude people who love war movies.

770
00:32:50,400 --> 00:32:52,400
I'll have you know that I am wearing a cape.

771
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:54,960
My cape is just made of sound deadening material

772
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:56,720
from an audio recording studio.

773
00:32:58,320 --> 00:32:59,520
It's a really great show.

774
00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:01,520
John's daughter doesn't like it

775
00:33:01,520 --> 00:33:03,840
because we sometimes say swear words on it,

776
00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:06,960
but almost everybody else that has ever listened to it

777
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:08,640
has enjoyed the program.

To the victor, go the spoiler alerts.

781
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:19,280
Y'all want a yahoo?

782
00:33:19,280 --> 00:33:19,520
No.

783
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:28,880
I want a munch.

784
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:29,360
Squad.

785
00:33:32,080 --> 00:33:33,840
I want too munch.

786
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:35,040
Squad.

787
00:33:35,040 --> 00:33:36,880
Took it into a minor key.

788
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:37,200
Yeah.

789
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:41,600
The big game's coming up, folks.

790
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:42,640
And I am-

791
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:43,520
It was yesterday.

792
00:33:44,320 --> 00:33:45,440
Coming up next year.

793
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:47,760
Super Bowl 34.

794
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:50,560
Just 364 days away.

795
00:33:50,560 --> 00:33:53,200
Almost certainly we're not at 34, are we?

796
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:54,000
54.

797
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:58,480
Super Bowl 54 coming up real quick.

798
00:33:58,480 --> 00:34:01,120
I can't wait to watch it to see who's in it.

799
00:34:01,120 --> 00:34:03,520
Bojangles is cashing in on-

800
00:34:03,520 --> 00:34:06,640
We can't say super-

801
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:08,400
Have you all ever known anyone

802
00:34:10,400 --> 00:34:13,280
so terrified to say anything

803
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:14,960
as people are to say the Super Bowl?

804
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:16,480
I know I'm just saying it,

805
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:18,480
but what happens?

806
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:19,760
It must be real bad, huh?

807
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:21,840
They must be really aggressive about that

808
00:34:21,840 --> 00:34:23,680
because people work really hard not to say it.

809
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:26,240
I think probably not us though.

810
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:28,880
I think we're probably fine.

811
00:34:28,880 --> 00:34:30,640
I think the Super Bowl-

812
00:34:30,640 --> 00:34:31,840
Yeah, I said it.

813
00:34:31,840 --> 00:34:33,680
What about Super Bowl?

814
00:34:34,640 --> 00:34:35,920
Send out an email that says,

815
00:34:35,920 --> 00:34:37,920
hey, also the big game now.

816
00:34:37,920 --> 00:34:40,160
You can't say that one anymore.

817
00:34:40,160 --> 00:34:42,560
Now you have to call it the Sipper Bowl from now on.

818
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:44,320
The football party.

819
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:45,440
Call it that or nothing.

820
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:47,920
So Bojangles just added-

821
00:34:47,920 --> 00:34:48,960
Competitive hugging.

822
00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:52,400
Bojangles adds an MVP to his lineup

823
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:55,040
just in time for the Super Bowl.

824
00:34:55,040 --> 00:34:57,120
I added it, not Bojangles.

825
00:34:57,120 --> 00:34:58,320
Come after me, lawyers.

826
00:34:59,360 --> 00:35:00,960
The caption on this photo,

827
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:02,720
which is the biggest pile of chicken

828
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:04,080
I've ever seen in my entire life,

829
00:35:05,120 --> 00:35:08,240
says, Bojangles, encourage you.

830
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:14,880
The name is plural.

831
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:16,160
The entity is singular.

832
00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:19,120
And so it says, Bojangles, encourage you

833
00:35:19,120 --> 00:35:20,960
to call ahead to pre-order

834
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:23,120
your 50 piece Chicken Supremes

835
00:35:23,120 --> 00:35:25,120
or Homestyle Tender Platter

836
00:35:25,120 --> 00:35:27,680
or Call of Duty Black Ops 5.

837
00:35:27,680 --> 00:35:28,800
Pre-order anything you want

838
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:29,920
when you call Bojangles.

839
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:31,760
We don't give a shit.

840
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:34,080
All great teams update their playbook

841
00:35:34,080 --> 00:35:35,360
before the big game.

842
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:40,560
All the teams update their playbook

843
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:41,760
before the big game.

844
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:45,040
That's why Bojangles is adding a new play

845
00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:48,240
just in time for this Sunday's showdown.

846
00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:52,160
A 50 piece Chicken Supremes platter

847
00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:54,400
available for $49.99.

848
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:56,080
Do that math.

849
00:35:56,080 --> 00:35:56,640
It's a buck.

850
00:35:57,440 --> 00:35:58,400
A tender.

851
00:35:58,400 --> 00:35:59,360
A buck a clock.

852
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:00,240
A buck a clock.

853
00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:01,680
This Sunday at participating.

854
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:02,880
Holy fuck.

855
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:03,680
A buck a clock.

856
00:36:03,680 --> 00:36:04,800
A buck a clock.

857
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:06,480
It's this Sunday at participating Bojangles.

858
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:07,280
Check your luck.

859
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:08,800
Fuck a buck.

860
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:09,520
A buck a clock.

861
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:12,960
Packed with your choice of our popular

862
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:15,120
perfectly seasoned Chicken Supreme

863
00:36:15,120 --> 00:36:18,480
or our mild flavorful Homestyle Tenders.

864
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:19,680
Hey, y'all, I don't know if you got

865
00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:20,720
Bojangles around you.

866
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:22,480
One of those is spicy and fuck me

867
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:24,400
if I can ever remember which one it is.

868
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:27,280
There's a 50 piece platter.

869
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:29,760
It also comes with 12 delectable sauces.

870
00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:31,520
Get your dip on.

871
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:33,200
Woof.

872
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:34,160
Oh, man.

873
00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:36,560
Get your dip on with our classic ranch

874
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:38,000
tangy barbecue.

875
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,800
Zesty Bo's special sauce gross.

876
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:43,840
And of course, that irresistible Bojangles

877
00:36:43,840 --> 00:36:44,640
honey mustard.

878
00:36:45,360 --> 00:36:46,240
Any good coach.

879
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:49,760
Bojangles is making a lot of assumptions

880
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:51,600
about its knowledge of sports.

881
00:36:51,600 --> 00:36:53,120
Any good coach knows it's important

882
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:54,560
to get your play in early

883
00:36:55,120 --> 00:36:56,400
and you can do the same.

884
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:57,440
What?

885
00:36:57,440 --> 00:36:58,240
Hey, you heard me.

886
00:36:58,240 --> 00:36:58,720
Start.

887
00:36:58,720 --> 00:36:59,200
Go.

888
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:00,640
Go, go, go.

889
00:37:00,640 --> 00:37:02,160
All right, guys, first down.

890
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:03,280
Let's go for that field goal.

891
00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:06,000
First down, better punt it.

892
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:07,680
Get that play in early, though.

893
00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:08,400
Don't twist it.

894
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:09,280
Never expect it.

895
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:11,040
You can call your local Bojangles today

896
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:12,880
to pre-order your platter for Sunday.

897
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:16,160
You may be mad at me for telling you this

898
00:37:16,720 --> 00:37:17,520
after the Super Bowl,

899
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:18,800
but I'm doing it for your own good.

900
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:19,760
I always assume with these,

901
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:21,360
there's some small percentage of the audience

902
00:37:21,360 --> 00:37:21,920
that will say,

903
00:37:21,920 --> 00:37:23,680
hmm, buck a clock, huh?

904
00:37:23,680 --> 00:37:24,640
Don't mind if I do.

905
00:37:24,640 --> 00:37:25,680
So I've just saved you from that.

906
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:26,640
You're welcome.

907
00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:28,000
Patrick say,

908
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,320
quote, a Bojangles 50 piece platter

909
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:32,480
will always win your game day gatherings.

910
00:37:33,360 --> 00:37:35,360
Most valuable platter award

911
00:37:36,240 --> 00:37:38,720
says Randy Poindexter,

912
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:41,200
senior vice president of marketing

913
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:41,760
for Bojangles.

914
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:43,200
No, no.

915
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:45,200
Hey, whatever, all the platters

916
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:47,920
and Bojangles,

917
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:49,200
you win most valuable platter.

918
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:51,360
But wait, I bake brownies myself.

919
00:37:51,360 --> 00:37:52,080
That doesn't matter.

920
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:53,280
Bojangles.

921
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:54,800
I spent 50 bucks on this,

922
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:56,080
a buck a clock.

923
00:37:56,080 --> 00:37:57,120
It's most valuable.

924
00:37:57,120 --> 00:37:59,040
This is a $50 retail price.

925
00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:00,400
I can take this out on the street

926
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:02,480
and wholesale it for $75.

927
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:03,760
Easy, no problem.

928
00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:05,520
Our Supremes and Homestyle Tenders

929
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:06,320
are so delicious,

930
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:09,200
you might even need to bring along

931
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:10,800
a second platter for your group

932
00:38:11,360 --> 00:38:12,640
of monsters.

933
00:38:13,360 --> 00:38:15,040
It doesn't say of monsters,

934
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:16,560
but hey, I don't care

935
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:17,760
how many people are gathered

936
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:18,640
in the Lord's name.

937
00:38:18,640 --> 00:38:20,160
And by the Lord, I mean the Super Bowl.

938
00:38:21,600 --> 00:38:23,680
They shouldn't eat more than 50 chickens

939
00:38:23,680 --> 00:38:25,440
and- Yeah.

940
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:27,040
This is my best friend.

941
00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:27,680
I hope you don't mind

942
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:28,720
I brought him to the game.

943
00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:30,160
He's a kiddie pool full

944
00:38:30,160 --> 00:38:31,600
of hydrochloric acid.

945
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:36,160
I brought this chipper shredder.

946
00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:36,660
I don't know.

947
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:38,720
So if you don't mind,

948
00:38:38,720 --> 00:38:40,160
I'm just going to karate kick

949
00:38:40,160 --> 00:38:41,440
the leg of this table off

950
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:42,480
and then just let everything

951
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:43,360
slurp down into it.

952
00:38:43,360 --> 00:38:44,320
This is my uncle.

953
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:44,960
He's a hole.

954
00:38:47,680 --> 00:38:48,560
So just to check,

955
00:38:48,560 --> 00:38:50,160
you didn't buy two of these platters,

956
00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:50,400
right?

957
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:52,000
Because hole uncle wants to-

958
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:52,800
Yeah, okay.

959
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:53,920
He's got to grub down too.

960
00:38:58,720 --> 00:39:00,000
Get creative with your chicken

961
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:01,680
Supremes or homestyle tenders.

962
00:39:01,680 --> 00:39:03,920
Check out Bojangles tailgate hacks

963
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:05,200
to learn how you can use

964
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:06,960
Bojangles menu items

965
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:08,320
as a base for creating

966
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:11,120
your own craveable game day recipes.

967
00:39:11,120 --> 00:39:12,800
So here is what Bojangles

968
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:14,000
is presumed to tell you.

969
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:16,400
You can take the things

970
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:18,480
that we made and make them

971
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:21,920
good for game day time.

972
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:23,680
Wait, what are they suggesting?

973
00:39:24,560 --> 00:39:26,640
They're suggesting tailgate hacks, Griffin.

974
00:39:26,640 --> 00:39:28,320
Justin, that doesn't mean anything to me.

975
00:39:29,120 --> 00:39:31,600
That sounds like some sort of

976
00:39:31,600 --> 00:39:33,680
cybermancer is trying to gain access

977
00:39:33,680 --> 00:39:36,000
to my station wagon through the rear.

978
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:38,080
So here's the thing that's troubling.

979
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:40,880
The press release says

980
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:42,080
that you can check out

981
00:39:42,080 --> 00:39:43,840
the Bojangles tailgate hacks,

982
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:46,720
but that information is not available

983
00:39:46,720 --> 00:39:50,000
anywhere on the internet.

984
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,880
I am currently very challenged

985
00:39:52,880 --> 00:39:58,640
by this Bojangles tailgate hack thing

986
00:39:58,640 --> 00:40:00,880
because they do say that it is...

987
00:40:01,600 --> 00:40:02,560
Okay, okay.

988
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:03,520
Okay, there's a Facebook page.

989
00:40:03,520 --> 00:40:04,320
Did you find the Facebook page?

990
00:40:04,320 --> 00:40:05,600
Yeah, I found the Facebook page.

991
00:40:05,600 --> 00:40:10,160
I got some YouTube's here

992
00:40:10,160 --> 00:40:11,120
from the Bo channel.

993
00:40:13,680 --> 00:40:14,480
Let's see.

994
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:15,680
Or some guacamole.

995
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:18,080
I'm going to tell you this one.

996
00:40:18,080 --> 00:40:20,000
It's buffalo chicken crescent ring.

997
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,080
Okay, so the person's made a huge

998
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:27,200
sort of sunburst out of croissant wedges.

999
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:29,680
Okay, it's like a flower shape.

1000
00:40:29,680 --> 00:40:31,920
And then they take a bunch of chicken

1001
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:33,280
off of three chicken breasts.

1002
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:35,200
Okay, then they dump in a bunch

1003
00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:36,960
of hot sauce into them.

1004
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:38,000
I bet they're going to stir them.

1005
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:38,720
Yep, yep.

1006
00:40:38,720 --> 00:40:39,760
They're stirring it, folks.

1007
00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:40,720
They're stirring it up.

1008
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:43,760
An entire brick of cream cheese.

1009
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:45,920
One container of Bojangles ranch.

1010
00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:47,200
No, sorry.

1011
00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:49,760
Two containers of Bojangles ranch sauce.

1012
00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:51,040
They combined those and...

1013
00:40:51,040 --> 00:40:52,000
No, don't mix them together.

1014
00:40:52,640 --> 00:40:54,720
No, they're mixing them together.

1015
00:40:56,320 --> 00:40:57,360
Oh, Christ.

1016
00:40:57,360 --> 00:40:58,960
Now they've made a ring of it

1017
00:40:58,960 --> 00:41:00,880
and it's inside the croissant.

1018
00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:03,280
And now they've topped it with cheese.

1019
00:41:03,280 --> 00:41:04,000
How could you?

1020
00:41:04,640 --> 00:41:06,080
And now they're folding up the edges

1021
00:41:06,080 --> 00:41:06,560
to make a big...

1022
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:07,280
Wait, slow down.

1023
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:08,160
I'm writing this down.

1024
00:41:08,160 --> 00:41:10,880
A big stinky ring of chicken

1025
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:12,880
and they've got more ranch for dipping

1026
00:41:13,520 --> 00:41:15,120
because fuck you.

1027
00:41:15,120 --> 00:41:22,080
This video came out November 17th, 2018

1028
00:41:22,080 --> 00:41:25,440
on the Bojangles official channel

1029
00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:29,520
and I am the 88th person to ever see it.

1030
00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:30,720
Oh, no.

1031
00:41:30,720 --> 00:41:32,640
How is this possible?

1032
00:41:32,640 --> 00:41:33,840
Oh, no.

1033
00:41:33,840 --> 00:41:34,960
How is it possible

1034
00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:38,240
that there are only 88 views of this video?

1035
00:41:38,240 --> 00:41:40,480
More than 88 people made it.

1036
00:41:40,480 --> 00:41:41,600
I'm looking at a different one

1037
00:41:41,600 --> 00:41:43,920
where they've made a sort of bruschetta

1038
00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:46,480
out of Bojangles potato rounds.

1039
00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:48,880
And this one's got...

1040
00:41:48,880 --> 00:41:51,280
It came out same date, 78 views on this one.

1041
00:41:51,280 --> 00:41:53,360
Hashtag Saturday, hashtag food hack.

1042
00:41:53,360 --> 00:41:54,720
These are so good.

1043
00:41:54,720 --> 00:41:56,240
Hashtag football, hashtag tailgate

1044
00:41:56,240 --> 00:41:58,960
with hashtag Bojangles, hashtag potato rounds.

1045
00:41:58,960 --> 00:41:59,600
Yes, please.

1046
00:41:59,600 --> 00:42:01,680
Hashtag the first empty dish at the tailgate.

1047
00:42:01,680 --> 00:42:03,280
We are your tailgate HQ.

1048
00:42:03,280 --> 00:42:05,040
Hashtag long live the tailgate.

1049
00:42:05,040 --> 00:42:06,080
Go get you some.

1050
00:42:07,120 --> 00:42:09,360
Do they really need the hashtag

1051
00:42:09,360 --> 00:42:11,360
potato rounds there?

1052
00:42:11,360 --> 00:42:15,200
As though if I wanted to find something about potatoes,

1053
00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:18,000
I couldn't simply search the word potatoes

1054
00:42:18,640 --> 00:42:21,920
and that would probably bring up everything about potatoes.

1055
00:42:21,920 --> 00:42:24,880
Let's all silently find this Facebook video.

1056
00:42:25,520 --> 00:42:28,240
I have not posted on Facebook since the birth of my son.

1057
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:30,560
I'm gonna go ahead and share this now.

1058
00:42:31,760 --> 00:42:33,120
I've just shared it now

1059
00:42:33,120 --> 00:42:34,800
and I will let you all know in real time

1060
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:36,720
how much social media attraction I get

1061
00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:38,000
with this video on my timeline.

1062
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:38,880
I want...

1063
00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:40,560
Can I push this a little further, Griffin?

1064
00:42:40,560 --> 00:42:41,360
Yeah.

1065
00:42:41,360 --> 00:42:42,880
I want everyone to share it.

1066
00:42:42,880 --> 00:42:47,840
I want everyone to go to the Bojangles page

1067
00:42:47,840 --> 00:42:48,880
and we're gonna make...

1068
00:42:48,880 --> 00:42:50,160
Yeah, you can find it easy.

1069
00:42:50,160 --> 00:42:52,160
Just search hashtag potato.

1070
00:42:52,880 --> 00:42:57,120
Everybody, I've shared it on my timeline.

1071
00:42:57,120 --> 00:43:00,720
Everybody should go find this fucking vid and share it

1072
00:43:00,720 --> 00:43:02,800
and just start commenting on it.

1073
00:43:02,800 --> 00:43:05,280
We'll be responding to questions throughout the week.

1074
00:43:05,840 --> 00:43:07,200
We'll be doing an AMA.

1075
00:43:07,200 --> 00:43:09,200
We'll be doing an AMA.

1076
00:43:09,200 --> 00:43:11,280
We own the comments on this bitch now.

1077
00:43:11,280 --> 00:43:12,080
These are ours.

1078
00:43:14,160 --> 00:43:14,720
Loving this.

1079
00:43:17,360 --> 00:43:19,520
I just commented loving this one.

1080
00:43:19,520 --> 00:43:21,920
So that's the comments from me, Griffin.

1081
00:43:21,920 --> 00:43:22,800
If you want to comment...

1082
00:43:23,360 --> 00:43:24,320
Yeah, let me get on yours.

1083
00:43:25,040 --> 00:43:27,280
You can just reply to my comment

1084
00:43:27,280 --> 00:43:31,680
that we did on the potato post.

1085
00:43:33,280 --> 00:43:34,000
People are gonna...

1086
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:35,200
I don't know.

1087
00:43:35,200 --> 00:43:38,080
Okay, my football guys love this one.

1088
00:43:38,080 --> 00:43:38,800
Oh, that's great.

1089
00:43:39,360 --> 00:43:42,080
Man, this video is gonna be viral all of a sudden.

1090
00:43:42,080 --> 00:43:44,640
And I feel pretty good that if you're the person that made it,

1091
00:43:44,640 --> 00:43:46,480
you're gonna have a kick-ass week because of it.

1092
00:43:46,480 --> 00:43:49,200
You're gonna think that you finally had an impact.

1093
00:43:50,560 --> 00:43:51,440
I mean, you did.

1094
00:43:51,440 --> 00:43:51,840
You did.

1095
00:43:51,840 --> 00:43:52,320
You did.

1096
00:43:52,320 --> 00:43:53,360
This ain't artificial.

1097
00:43:53,360 --> 00:43:54,080
You did it.

1098
00:43:54,080 --> 00:43:56,160
Okay, should I do a Yahoo?

1099
00:43:56,160 --> 00:43:56,400
Yeah.

1100
00:43:56,400 --> 00:43:57,600
Or is there more?

1101
00:43:57,600 --> 00:43:58,560
I mean, I had...

1102
00:43:58,560 --> 00:44:00,960
There's other things, but I feel like we've spent too much time

1103
00:44:00,960 --> 00:44:02,240
on the Munch Squad already.

1104
00:44:02,240 --> 00:44:06,160
Okay, so we'll just move on.

1105
00:44:07,360 --> 00:44:09,360
I got one here that was sent in by Adrian Cowles.

1106
00:44:09,360 --> 00:44:10,400
Thank you so much, Adrian.

1107
00:44:10,400 --> 00:44:13,200
It's a Yahoo Answers user, Window, who asks,

1108
00:44:14,240 --> 00:44:17,440
is it rude to look at other people's shopping

1109
00:44:17,440 --> 00:44:18,480
at the supermarket?

1110
00:44:19,040 --> 00:44:20,480
Wait, have we talked about this before?

1111
00:44:21,280 --> 00:44:23,600
Sorry, I was distracted because I'm sharing the link

1112
00:44:23,600 --> 00:44:26,800
to the potato thing on my Twitter,

1113
00:44:26,800 --> 00:44:29,120
but with no comments whatsoever.

1114
00:44:29,120 --> 00:44:29,920
It's gotta be Facebook.

1115
00:44:29,920 --> 00:44:30,400
It's gotta be Facebook.

1116
00:44:30,400 --> 00:44:31,040
I want it to be...

1117
00:44:31,040 --> 00:44:31,520
It's gotta be Facebook.

1118
00:44:31,520 --> 00:44:34,080
Well, I'm sharing the link to the Facebook page.

1119
00:44:34,080 --> 00:44:38,000
Okay, it'll be fully five days before this episode comes out.

1120
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:40,160
Yeah, that's a long time to wait for content.

1121
00:44:42,800 --> 00:44:44,160
But hey, bud, it's your Twitter.

1122
00:44:45,120 --> 00:44:45,680
Thank you.

1123
00:44:46,800 --> 00:44:48,560
So is it rude to look at other people's shopping

1124
00:44:48,560 --> 00:44:49,760
in the supermarket?

1125
00:44:49,760 --> 00:44:51,440
I love looking at other people's shopping

1126
00:44:51,440 --> 00:44:54,080
in the supermarket, but I hate when they look at mine.

1127
00:44:54,080 --> 00:44:57,200
But everybody's looking all day, all the time, right?

1128
00:44:57,760 --> 00:44:58,160
Yes.

1129
00:44:58,720 --> 00:44:58,960
Yes.

1130
00:44:58,960 --> 00:45:01,520
Yes, when I roll past, my favorite thing to do

1131
00:45:01,520 --> 00:45:03,920
is to try to like Sherlock a thing and be like,

1132
00:45:03,920 --> 00:45:06,560
oh, they're gonna make, I don't know, barbecue

1133
00:45:06,560 --> 00:45:09,040
or they have diarrhea or whatever.

1134
00:45:09,040 --> 00:45:10,720
If you walk past and you look at their cart

1135
00:45:10,720 --> 00:45:13,680
and you're like, oh, they're, I don't know,

1136
00:45:13,680 --> 00:45:15,680
planning a big weekend with a college friend

1137
00:45:15,680 --> 00:45:17,520
that they haven't seen in a decade.

1138
00:45:17,520 --> 00:45:19,760
Yeah, the Mario Party mini game version of this

1139
00:45:19,760 --> 00:45:25,120
is at CVS when you see me and I've got special order

1140
00:45:25,120 --> 00:45:27,920
sort of these big boxes of Imodium.

1141
00:45:27,920 --> 00:45:29,760
And so you see me walk up and you know sort of

1142
00:45:29,760 --> 00:45:30,960
what my whole story is.

1143
00:45:30,960 --> 00:45:33,280
But at the grocery store, I mostly try to just try

1144
00:45:33,280 --> 00:45:36,160
to play a game of just like, are you being a healthy boy?

1145
00:45:36,160 --> 00:45:37,680
Because that's really all I can get.

1146
00:45:37,680 --> 00:45:39,520
I don't like to snoop in there a lot,

1147
00:45:39,520 --> 00:45:42,720
but I can tell like, I can tell, I can tell.

1148
00:45:42,720 --> 00:45:44,560
If I see a lot of stuff from the produce section,

1149
00:45:44,560 --> 00:45:46,400
I'm like, you're just bragging now.

1150
00:45:46,400 --> 00:45:50,160
My worry is always that when I buy something

1151
00:45:50,160 --> 00:45:53,440
with toilet paper, the people who see it

1152
00:45:53,440 --> 00:45:56,960
are gonna assume that whatever it is makes me poop.

1153
00:45:56,960 --> 00:45:58,080
Yeah.

1154
00:45:58,080 --> 00:46:02,320
Like if I buy a symphony bar and toilet paper,

1155
00:46:02,320 --> 00:46:04,800
I was assuming they were gonna think the symphony bar.

1156
00:46:04,800 --> 00:46:06,240
You know what's heartbreaking?

1157
00:46:06,240 --> 00:46:07,360
We've definitely talked about this before.

1158
00:46:07,360 --> 00:46:08,240
That's what I was gonna say.

1159
00:46:08,240 --> 00:46:09,920
This is the, I don't wanna have another

1160
00:46:09,920 --> 00:46:11,600
Hakuna Matata Bugs moment,

1161
00:46:11,600 --> 00:46:13,680
but Justin is definitely talking about his fear

1162
00:46:13,680 --> 00:46:15,840
of buying stuff with toilet paper for the fear

1163
00:46:15,840 --> 00:46:18,240
that it would make people think that whatever he was buying

1164
00:46:18,240 --> 00:46:19,840
would make him shit.

1165
00:46:19,840 --> 00:46:21,760
Well, that's why I like to buy all that stuff,

1166
00:46:21,760 --> 00:46:24,240
the sort of unspeakable stuff in one lump sum.

1167
00:46:24,240 --> 00:46:27,280
So I'll get toilet paper and, you know, Jimmy Caps.

1168
00:46:27,280 --> 00:46:30,480
And then you don't know what kind of fucking day I'm having.

1169
00:46:31,360 --> 00:46:34,720
I hate the feeling of buying 18 rolls of toilet paper

1170
00:46:35,760 --> 00:46:37,040
like when I'm at the store,

1171
00:46:38,320 --> 00:46:41,920
but there's not a quicker emotional flip I go through

1172
00:46:41,920 --> 00:46:44,560
than buying 18 rolls of toilet paper at the store

1173
00:46:44,560 --> 00:46:46,080
and feeling like a bad person

1174
00:46:46,080 --> 00:46:50,080
to seeing 18 rolls of toilet paper in my hall closet

1175
00:46:50,080 --> 00:46:51,760
and I feel bulletproof.

1176
00:46:51,760 --> 00:46:53,200
Nothing could touch me then.

1177
00:46:53,200 --> 00:46:56,000
Look at all this fucking toilet paper I have.

1178
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:57,920
I'm good for whatever happens.

1179
00:46:57,920 --> 00:46:59,920
I'm so loaded, I'll never have to think

1180
00:46:59,920 --> 00:47:03,760
about toilet paper again, ever, ever, ever, never again.

1181
00:47:04,480 --> 00:47:07,360
That explains why you keep calling your closet

1182
00:47:07,360 --> 00:47:09,440
the panic room and it's just full

1183
00:47:09,440 --> 00:47:10,880
top to bottom of toilet paper.

1184
00:47:11,440 --> 00:47:14,000
So I'll tell you what I like seeing

1185
00:47:14,720 --> 00:47:18,880
is just a lot of one thing in somebody's cart,

1186
00:47:18,880 --> 00:47:22,080
just like chock full of Activia.

1187
00:47:22,080 --> 00:47:24,800
And it's like, good for you.

1188
00:47:25,840 --> 00:47:28,160
Whenever I see something like that where someone's like,

1189
00:47:28,160 --> 00:47:31,600
they got the ingredients to say make pancakes,

1190
00:47:31,600 --> 00:47:34,480
but times 50 where I'm like,

1191
00:47:34,480 --> 00:47:37,280
you are doing a charity fundraiser for something

1192
00:47:37,280 --> 00:47:38,400
and I support you.

1193
00:47:38,400 --> 00:47:40,720
And what never crosses my mind is

1194
00:47:40,720 --> 00:47:42,720
that person fucking loves pancakes.

1195
00:47:42,720 --> 00:47:44,640
Loves them, has to have Activia.

1196
00:47:44,640 --> 00:47:47,040
I noticed the thing that I think the thing I've seen the most

1197
00:47:47,040 --> 00:47:49,200
in this situation is party pizzas.

1198
00:47:49,200 --> 00:47:52,000
You see college kids and they've got like 50 party pizzas

1199
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:53,600
in there and they've got a look on their face

1200
00:47:53,600 --> 00:47:55,440
like they're about to pull the heist of the century.

1201
00:47:57,280 --> 00:47:59,040
Nobody can tell me how to live anymore, dad.

1202
00:47:59,920 --> 00:48:02,720
99 cents for a whole pizza?

1203
00:48:03,920 --> 00:48:05,840
I'm a savvy shopper now.

1204
00:48:05,840 --> 00:48:08,640
Their dad bod hasn't fully sort of formed yet.

1205
00:48:08,640 --> 00:48:09,360
Sure.

1206
00:48:09,360 --> 00:48:10,800
Hasn't really gestated.

1207
00:48:10,800 --> 00:48:13,040
There is a perfect three years where you have the money

1208
00:48:13,040 --> 00:48:16,480
to buy party pizza and the physical ability to do so.

1209
00:48:17,120 --> 00:48:17,620
Yes.

1210
00:48:18,320 --> 00:48:20,080
This is why they make carts so big

1211
00:48:20,080 --> 00:48:22,640
and so fucking see-through is so that everybody

1212
00:48:22,640 --> 00:48:23,760
can scope out each other.

1213
00:48:23,760 --> 00:48:27,360
Everybody can clock each other's sort of needs

1214
00:48:27,360 --> 00:48:30,480
without being like super, super obvious about it.

1215
00:48:30,480 --> 00:48:32,720
It's really good people watching.

1216
00:48:32,720 --> 00:48:35,360
Let me give you a number one Travis shopping hack.

1217
00:48:35,360 --> 00:48:37,200
This is why every time you just grab,

1218
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:40,320
like you're going to grab some like pickled onions.

1219
00:48:40,320 --> 00:48:42,000
You're just going to grab something, right?

1220
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:43,040
Three or four of them.

1221
00:48:43,040 --> 00:48:44,720
But you're going to hand it back to the cashier

1222
00:48:44,720 --> 00:48:45,360
when you get up there and say,

1223
00:48:45,360 --> 00:48:46,160
oh, I changed my mind.

1224
00:48:46,160 --> 00:48:47,360
I don't want these pickled onions.

1225
00:48:47,360 --> 00:48:49,440
And that's going to keep the looky loos.

1226
00:48:49,440 --> 00:48:50,080
I see.

1227
00:48:50,080 --> 00:48:52,560
I'm guessing about what's going on in there.

1228
00:48:52,560 --> 00:48:54,720
Like, oh, he's pickled onions.

1229
00:48:54,720 --> 00:48:55,440
What's he doing?

1230
00:48:55,440 --> 00:48:57,680
Oh, those weren't my pickled onions.

1231
00:48:57,680 --> 00:48:57,920
See, I like-

1232
00:48:57,920 --> 00:48:59,120
I was like decoy.

1233
00:48:59,120 --> 00:49:00,720
I like to go and get some-

1234
00:49:00,720 --> 00:49:02,800
Also, it makes more work for the people

1235
00:49:02,800 --> 00:49:04,320
who work at the grocery store.

1236
00:49:04,320 --> 00:49:05,840
I bet they appreciate it.

1237
00:49:05,840 --> 00:49:07,440
I like to swing by the butcher,

1238
00:49:07,440 --> 00:49:09,440
get some of that good sort of parchment

1239
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:12,640
and line my cart with it.

1240
00:49:12,640 --> 00:49:12,960
That's fun.

1241
00:49:12,960 --> 00:49:14,240
Because what I do, that's for,

1242
00:49:14,240 --> 00:49:15,760
now you can't see inside.

1243
00:49:15,760 --> 00:49:16,720
This is my stuff.

1244
00:49:17,520 --> 00:49:19,200
And you can also draw on it.

1245
00:49:19,200 --> 00:49:21,200
You can draw on it, which is fun.

1246
00:49:21,200 --> 00:49:21,520
For the kids.

1247
00:49:21,520 --> 00:49:22,560
Well, and for me.

1248
00:49:22,560 --> 00:49:24,400
I like to put a hole in the bottom

1249
00:49:24,400 --> 00:49:26,400
of my shopping cart for trash

1250
00:49:26,400 --> 00:49:28,640
and claws and bones.

1251
00:49:28,640 --> 00:49:31,600
So as I'm eating my way through the-

1252
00:49:31,600 --> 00:49:32,640
Oh, Justin.

1253
00:49:33,840 --> 00:49:34,480
What's up?

1254
00:49:34,480 --> 00:49:34,960
They don't-

1255
00:49:34,960 --> 00:49:35,680
There's no way-

1256
00:49:35,680 --> 00:49:38,080
Man, we've talked a lot about shoplifting

1257
00:49:38,080 --> 00:49:40,480
or lifting, as the lifting community calls it.

1258
00:49:41,440 --> 00:49:42,560
But we've never really talked

1259
00:49:42,560 --> 00:49:43,920
about food lifting before.

1260
00:49:44,720 --> 00:49:45,040
There's-

1261
00:49:45,920 --> 00:49:47,760
I've already used it up.

1262
00:49:47,760 --> 00:49:49,760
You can't get this out of me.

1263
00:49:49,760 --> 00:49:51,120
That's good stuff.

1264
00:49:51,120 --> 00:49:51,920
You can pull the watch out of-

1265
00:49:51,920 --> 00:49:52,960
Well, they can.

1266
00:49:52,960 --> 00:49:54,960
You can pull the watch out of my pocket,

1267
00:49:54,960 --> 00:49:57,600
but you can't pull the Activia

1268
00:49:57,600 --> 00:49:59,600
out of my GI tract.

1269
00:49:59,600 --> 00:50:00,560
Cause it's already doing,

1270
00:50:00,560 --> 00:50:02,000
it's great work in there.

1271
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:03,040
Hey, I'm going to give,

1272
00:50:03,760 --> 00:50:05,760
I don't know, Kroger or Meyer

1273
00:50:05,760 --> 00:50:07,280
or whoever's listening,

1274
00:50:07,280 --> 00:50:09,600
a million billion dollar idea.

1275
00:50:10,320 --> 00:50:13,280
Put little like self checkout

1276
00:50:13,280 --> 00:50:14,320
throughout the store.

1277
00:50:15,280 --> 00:50:16,640
So then as I'm walking, I'm like,

1278
00:50:16,640 --> 00:50:18,640
I want to tear into these Cheez-Its right now.

1279
00:50:19,200 --> 00:50:21,920
I can just scan it and pop the fiber in

1280
00:50:21,920 --> 00:50:23,280
and then just start eating them.

1281
00:50:23,280 --> 00:50:23,680
Boom.

1282
00:50:23,680 --> 00:50:24,720
My receipt, look out.

1283
00:50:25,680 --> 00:50:26,800
Or to just, you know,

1284
00:50:26,800 --> 00:50:28,880
let's add back into the economy, Travis.

1285
00:50:28,880 --> 00:50:31,360
We can have like a patience associate

1286
00:50:31,360 --> 00:50:33,920
who goes around and if they see you sort of,

1287
00:50:34,480 --> 00:50:36,800
you know, slavering over your own cart,

1288
00:50:36,800 --> 00:50:38,080
they see you and like,

1289
00:50:38,080 --> 00:50:41,120
can't wait to crack into that dry tortellini, huh?

1290
00:50:41,120 --> 00:50:41,920
I feel you.

1291
00:50:41,920 --> 00:50:43,600
You want me to beep that out for you?

1292
00:50:43,600 --> 00:50:44,800
And then I can beep it out

1293
00:50:44,800 --> 00:50:46,240
and then you can have yourself a time.

1294
00:50:46,240 --> 00:50:47,840
And we'll have private booths

1295
00:50:47,840 --> 00:50:49,120
for you to do this work in.

1296
00:50:49,760 --> 00:50:51,440
Yes, oh, I like that.

1297
00:50:51,440 --> 00:50:52,560
Oh, and you set me up

1298
00:50:52,560 --> 00:50:54,080
with like a little camp stove

1299
00:50:54,080 --> 00:50:55,120
and a pot of water

1300
00:50:55,120 --> 00:50:57,040
and I can have that tortellini right now.

1301
00:50:58,240 --> 00:51:00,000
You get me a Bic lighter and a can of Coke,

1302
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:01,440
I'll tortellini those up for you.

1303
00:51:04,880 --> 00:51:10,160
My local Kroger has a program

1304
00:51:10,160 --> 00:51:13,360
where you can have old cookies

1305
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:15,360
sitting out on the deli counter.

1306
00:51:15,360 --> 00:51:18,560
There's a container of yesterday's cookies

1307
00:51:18,560 --> 00:51:20,960
that is free, you know, for the kids.

1308
00:51:21,920 --> 00:51:26,000
And I talked to this outreach program

1309
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:29,600
up to my four-year-old daughter, Charlie, a lot.

1310
00:51:29,600 --> 00:51:31,760
And because it was the first time

1311
00:51:31,760 --> 00:51:34,080
we had a Kona Kroger, I think.

1312
00:51:34,080 --> 00:51:35,520
And I said, they got this thing,

1313
00:51:35,520 --> 00:51:37,040
they used to have this thing as a kid

1314
00:51:37,040 --> 00:51:38,480
where they would have like free cookies.

1315
00:51:39,040 --> 00:51:43,360
So I rolled back to the counter of the deli

1316
00:51:43,360 --> 00:51:46,560
and there's no container of cookies.

1317
00:51:47,600 --> 00:51:52,480
And everyone working at the counter

1318
00:51:53,360 --> 00:51:56,320
is like 20 feet away from the counter.

1319
00:51:56,880 --> 00:52:00,320
So I started standing there

1320
00:52:00,320 --> 00:52:03,920
with like a casual kind of talking to my daughter

1321
00:52:03,920 --> 00:52:06,480
about, huh, I guess there's no cookies, sweetheart.

1322
00:52:06,480 --> 00:52:09,040
I thought, but I realized this wasn't loud enough

1323
00:52:09,040 --> 00:52:10,800
to get the attention of anybody.

1324
00:52:10,800 --> 00:52:12,800
So then I started talking louder.

1325
00:52:16,800 --> 00:52:20,800
Well, sweetie, I guess they don't have any free cookies.

1326
00:52:21,840 --> 00:52:24,880
I'm sorry, I guess they don't have any this time.

1327
00:52:25,680 --> 00:52:31,680
And then the person working the counter

1328
00:52:31,680 --> 00:52:33,520
20 feet away looks up at me,

1329
00:52:34,080 --> 00:52:37,120
takes off their gloves and start walking up.

1330
00:52:37,120 --> 00:52:39,280
And I'm like, oh no, oh no, oh no.

1331
00:52:39,280 --> 00:52:41,120
Oh no, oh no, I don't want,

1332
00:52:41,120 --> 00:52:42,880
this is too involved, oh no.

1333
00:52:42,880 --> 00:52:44,720
And they said, what do you need?

1334
00:52:44,720 --> 00:52:46,160
And I said, free cookies.

1335
00:52:52,720 --> 00:52:56,400
And they looked at me completely blank,

1336
00:52:56,400 --> 00:53:01,360
like, of course you'd like some free cookies.

1337
00:53:01,360 --> 00:53:03,120
Sir, this is a store.

1338
00:53:05,360 --> 00:53:08,480
Everything is purchased here.

1339
00:53:08,480 --> 00:53:10,800
I cut, I cut pigs.

1340
00:53:10,800 --> 00:53:12,240
What are you talking about?

1341
00:53:13,520 --> 00:53:14,720
I'm the pig cutter.

1342
00:53:16,480 --> 00:53:19,040
I have no jurisdiction over cookie prices.

1343
00:53:20,240 --> 00:53:22,480
So, okay, for future reference,

1344
00:53:22,480 --> 00:53:23,760
if you do go to Croaker,

1345
00:53:23,760 --> 00:53:26,400
the free cookies are at the bakery counter.

1346
00:53:26,400 --> 00:53:32,240
That's where you're going to want to go for that.

1347
00:53:32,240 --> 00:53:37,120
You don't want to go to the place where they cut the meat.

1348
00:53:37,120 --> 00:53:39,360
And ask for free cookies

1349
00:53:39,360 --> 00:53:42,400
because you will be an embarrassment to your child.

1350
00:53:43,600 --> 00:53:44,640
And your brothers.

1351
00:53:46,240 --> 00:53:49,600
And the audience of people, I'm assuming, at this point.

1352
00:53:49,600 --> 00:53:52,400
So I guess this is my roundabout way of saying

1353
00:53:52,400 --> 00:53:56,000
I'm super sorry to Croaker and everybody.

1354
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:57,600
And I'm just really sorry.

1355
00:53:58,240 --> 00:54:00,080
I've just realized that, oh no,

1356
00:54:00,080 --> 00:54:02,640
this has become too involved could also be

1357
00:54:02,640 --> 00:54:05,600
like the McElroy motto on our crest of arms.

1358
00:54:05,600 --> 00:54:08,480
Folks, thanks for hanging out with us.

1359
00:54:08,480 --> 00:54:10,320
We sure appreciated our time with you.

1360
00:54:10,320 --> 00:54:11,680
We hope you've enjoyed yourself.

1361
00:54:12,880 --> 00:54:16,720
We are, yes, we have one last chance to you

1362
00:54:17,280 --> 00:54:22,800
to pitch our shows in Birmingham, Alabama,

1363
00:54:22,800 --> 00:54:26,080
and New Orleans, Louisiana.

1364
00:54:26,640 --> 00:54:29,840
These are going to be happening this week

1365
00:54:29,840 --> 00:54:31,600
as you listen to this.

1366
00:54:31,600 --> 00:54:36,400
On February the 7th, we're going to be in Birmingham, Alabama

1367
00:54:37,120 --> 00:54:38,240
at the Alabama Theater.

1368
00:54:38,720 --> 00:54:42,480
And on the 9th, we're going to be doing the Adventure Zone

1369
00:54:42,480 --> 00:54:44,320
at the Orpheum in New Orleans.

1370
00:54:44,320 --> 00:54:45,920
The 10th, we're going to be doing

1371
00:54:45,920 --> 00:54:48,800
My Brother, My Brother and Me in New Orleans.

1372
00:54:48,800 --> 00:54:50,720
Both of those My Brother, My Brother and Me shows

1373
00:54:50,720 --> 00:54:54,160
will have Sawbones and Schmanners opening up for them.

1374
00:54:54,960 --> 00:54:56,080
So it's a huge value.

1375
00:54:57,120 --> 00:54:59,200
Come see them, come see us.

1376
00:54:59,200 --> 00:55:02,080
Also, go ahead and start sending in your questions

1377
00:55:02,080 --> 00:55:03,440
for those of you haven't already.

1378
00:55:03,440 --> 00:55:06,800
Make sure to put New Orleans or Birmingham

1379
00:55:06,800 --> 00:55:08,000
in the subject line.

1380
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:09,840
And I'm just going to go ahead and tell you

1381
00:55:09,840 --> 00:55:11,680
to send in those yahoos too.

1382
00:55:11,680 --> 00:55:12,480
Am I right, Griffin?

1383
00:55:12,480 --> 00:55:14,160
Yes, please, please, please.

1384
00:55:14,160 --> 00:55:16,960
If you go to McElroy.family and click tours,

1385
00:55:16,960 --> 00:55:19,200
you can get tickets for those shows.

1386
00:55:19,200 --> 00:55:20,560
I think they're going to be very fun

1387
00:55:21,120 --> 00:55:23,280
and we would love to see you there.

1388
00:55:23,280 --> 00:55:24,320
So please come out for those.

1389
00:55:25,120 --> 00:55:28,480
While you're at it, just poke around McElroy.family

1390
00:55:28,480 --> 00:55:30,400
and also find links to our merch

1391
00:55:30,400 --> 00:55:32,880
and to our other projects, including video stuff

1392
00:55:32,880 --> 00:55:34,880
like episodes of Monster Factory.

1393
00:55:34,880 --> 00:55:38,160
There should be a new one up by the time you hear this.

1394
00:55:38,160 --> 00:55:40,160
So go check that out.

1395
00:55:40,160 --> 00:55:41,920
Thanks to John Roderick and the Long Winters

1396
00:55:41,920 --> 00:55:42,800
for the use of our theme song.

1397
00:55:42,800 --> 00:55:44,000
It's a departure off the album,

1398
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:47,200
Putting the Days to Bed, which is a bop.

1399
00:55:47,200 --> 00:55:48,880
And also thank you to Maximum Fun

1400
00:55:48,880 --> 00:55:50,000
for having us on the network.

1401
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:50,880
You can go to Maximum Fun,

1402
00:55:50,880 --> 00:55:52,400
check out all the great shows there.

1403
00:55:53,360 --> 00:55:54,640
Lots of new additions to the network.

1404
00:55:54,640 --> 00:55:56,720
Very exciting, all at MaximumFun.org.

1405
00:55:56,720 --> 00:55:57,920
And do y'all want that final?

1406
00:55:57,920 --> 00:55:58,560
You know I do.

1407
00:55:58,560 --> 00:55:58,960
Yes.

1408
00:55:59,520 --> 00:56:01,840
This final Yahoo was sent in by Sid Ross.

1409
00:56:01,840 --> 00:56:02,800
Thank you, Sid.

1410
00:56:02,800 --> 00:56:04,560
It is an anonymous Yahoo answers user

1411
00:56:04,560 --> 00:56:06,880
who I'm going to call Preston.

1412
00:56:06,880 --> 00:56:07,360
Asks...

1413
00:56:12,240 --> 00:56:14,560
Can 38 year olds listen to Slipknot?

1414
00:56:16,960 --> 00:56:18,720
My name is Justin McElroy.

1415
00:56:18,720 --> 00:56:20,240
I'm Travis McElroy.

I'm just gonna end with this.

1423
00:57:04,080 --> 00:57:10,960
Everybody, you're doing a remarkable job

1424
00:57:11,520 --> 00:57:15,920
of swimming through the shit show that is parenting.

1425
00:57:15,920 --> 00:57:18,480
So join us each week as we judge less,

1426
