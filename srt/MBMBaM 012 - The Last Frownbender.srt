1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,000
If you change your mind on the first in line Honey, I'm still free, take your chance on me

2
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:19,000
If you need me, let me know, I'm gonna be around If you got no place to go when you're feeling down

3
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:24,000
If you're all alone when the pretty birds have flown

4
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:30,000
If you need me, let me know, I'm still free, take your chance on me

5
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
If you got no place to go when the pretty birds have flown

6
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:40,000
If you need me, let me know, I'm still free, take your chance on me

7
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:46,000
If you got no place to go when the pretty birds have flown

8
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:56,000
If you got no place to go when the pretty birds have flown

9
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,000
I wish you guys would have told me this before I took all the epic act

10
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Oh, I'm Justin McRoy by the way

11
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,000
I'm Travis McRoy

12
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I'm Griffin McRoy

13
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Hey, can you guys hear me over there?

14
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Can you hear me all the way out on the east coast?

15
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Griffin's rocking it Midwest style these days, he's moved to...

16
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
I'm up in that bread basket dog

17
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
I finally got his piece of the pie

18
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Yeah, I did, it's so nice out here

19
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Yeah

20
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,000
No

21
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
No, scary

22
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Can I come back please?

23
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Have you seen any gangs?

24
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:51,000
It's so hot all the time, the gangs and wild dogs just right across the street

25
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:55,000
I don't like it here anymore

26
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Oh man, okay, so here we go

27
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,000
This is the first question, it's from FormSpring

28
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,000
My university flatmates have gone home for the summer

29
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
What are you, where are you from?

30
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Flatmates?

31
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,000
However, I have a summer placement

32
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:17,000
What can I do to stop becoming too bored or going slightly crazy?

33
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
I don't understand half of the words in this question

34
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,000
I don't speak the same language as you

35
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
A summer placement, flatmates?

36
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
I think that means they have summer classes

37
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,000
I know what you can do to help pass the time

38
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Get an English dictionary and memorize it

39
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,000
So you call things the right names

40
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Or maybe just move to Merca

41
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Move to Merca

42
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
This would be the best day to do it

43
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Yeah

44
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
America's birthday

45
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Greatest day

46
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
How old is old lady liberty?

47
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
60, 70 years old, who can keep track?

48
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
I believe you mean 70 years young

49
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
70 years young

50
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,000
You know, being bored

51
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
I remember those days

52
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,000
I remember when I would worry about being bored

53
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Who has time to be bored anymore?

54
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Are you sleeping enough?

55
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Set yourself up some kind of random project

56
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:13,000
This summer I am going to read 16 books

57
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,000
I am going to build a cabinet

58
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Open a lemonade stand

59
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
A lemonade stand for grown-ups

60
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Only Mike's Hard Lemonade

61
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Yeah, what's up?

62
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
That'd be good

63
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
That's got to be legal

64
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Refreshing

65
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
I like your house's suggestion

66
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Say by the end of this summer you are going to kick ass at photography

67
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Or kung fu or something

68
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
And use your time that way

69
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Or street side bartending

70
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Or just treasure these days because soon you won't be bored

71
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Ever again

72
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Soon you'll be dead

73
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
It's the best time to go exploring too

74
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Go exploring?

75
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Yeah, if you are in a college town and everyone is left for the summer

76
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,000
You can go to all kinds of places

77
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Or you can just go on a rampage

78
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Just go on a looting rampage because nobody is there

79
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Yeah, say by the end of this summer I am going to break into 16 houses

80
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Goals are so important

81
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Goal setting is so important

82
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
So I got a problem

83
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Oh no

84
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
I am in a situation

85
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
I love this girl

86
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
I work with her

87
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Also I am a random person on forum spring

88
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
But she has a boyfriend

89
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
That is a problem

90
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
That is a problem

91
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
She has told me she likes it

92
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Let me start at the beginning because I feel like we have gotten confused

93
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
I am in a situation

94
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:40,000
I love this girl I work with but she has a boyfriend

95
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,000
She has told me she likes me and wants to date me

96
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:47,000
But she doesn't want to lose what she has with her current boyfriend

97
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
But I really want to date her

98
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
What?

99
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
What should I do?

100
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
That is the most ridiculous thing I have ever heard

101
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Okay, so alright

102
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
She is with

103
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Okay, you love girl A

104
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Girl A is dating girl B

105
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Or boy

106
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Guy B

107
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Wait

108
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Lesbian apocalypse

109
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
It is coming so quickly

110
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Is it a girl?

111
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
I don't know

112
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
So

113
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Dude

114
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Dude, dude, dude, dude, dude

115
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
I have a bigger problem with this question

116
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:25,000
And it is that he starts with I love this girl I work with

117
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Yikes

118
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Yeah, dude

119
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
You are rushing

120
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Here is the thing

121
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:36,000
If she is with this guy

122
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,000
And she also wants to be with you

123
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Then they are hopefully going to self-destruct

124
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:46,000
But you need to tell her that if she wants to be with you

125
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
You are better than that

126
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:51,000
She needs to drop the proverbial zero

127
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
And get with the proverbial hero

128
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
But don't let her string you along like this

129
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
If she wants to be with you she needs to dump that dude

130
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
I know it sucks

131
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,000
I know he is going to cry and sit in her shitty mixtape for a week

132
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Sorry

133
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
But it sounds like she is setting up

134
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
If she wants a little booty on the side

135
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
If she is making the statement

136
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Yeah, I want to be with you

137
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:10,000
But I don't want to lose what I have with my current boyfriend

138
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,000
A, that is a really shitty thing to say

139
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
B, what she is setting up is

140
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
But we can still hang out

141
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Is that what you want to be, FormSpring?

142
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:22,000
You want to be a side booty?

143
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,000
You know, I knew a guy with a side booty once

144
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
It is really tragic, I shouldn't joke about it

145
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
It is a serious medical problem

146
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
What is that stain on the side of your pants?

147
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
I am sorry, I have a side booty

148
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
And I have no control over it

149
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Because my destiny is not wired properly

150
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:40,000
I absorbed one tenth of a twin

151
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
And I just got one of his butt cheeks

152
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
So he has

153
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Wait, let's jump back

154
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
So he has two butts

155
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
One on the back, one on the side

156
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:50,000
It is more of a one and a half situation

157
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Yeah, the one on the side doesn't count as much

158
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,000
It is like a side butt, but it is only like half a butt

159
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Because you don't have room for a full butt on the side of your body

160
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
God, biology 101 Travis

161
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,000
I am sorry, I wasn't paying attention that day

162
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:06,000
They can fix that with a pretty simple outpatient procedure

163
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Ask your doctor wife about it

164
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Jacob via Gmail asks, recently at a camp out with a couple of friends in my backyard

165
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:20,000
In the Canadian woods, I got really close to a girl

166
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
My friend has been chasing for a while

167
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:26,000
And ended up hooking up with her without anyone else noticing

168
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,000
I like that verbiage

169
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Should I tell my butt or keep it a secret?

170
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Tell your butt

171
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Jacob

172
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
What can I say, nice ninja hooking up first of all

173
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Jacob has the ability to turn invisible like a chameleon whenever he is fully aroused

174
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Jacob, I think that this story is so cool that you just need to write it out

175
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Because you don't want to taint it by telling your friend

176
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,000
I think you need to keep this a secret in your heart when things are down

177
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Just think about that time that you covertly snuck into a girl

178
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,000
And hooked up with her

179
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Here is my question, did she notice?

180
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Because you have a sincere problem

181
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:11,000
I think you should go ahead and tell him

182
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Because if you were that stealth about it, then he probably won't believe you

183
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:18,000
And he'll just turn it into a joke and he'll diffuse the whole situation

184
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Yeah, I would never tell anybody

185
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Yeah, keep it to yourself

186
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,000
And keep up the discreet lovemaking

187
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Because that's a skill that you're going to exercise more often than you might think

188
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:36,000
This is one situation where I kind of wish this guy would start an advice podcast

189
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Where he could ask him about his secret lovemaking

190
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:44,000
I was in the middle of a group of friends, but I really wanted to bone down on this girl

191
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
What should I wear?

192
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,000
One of my friends was like, did you feel a breeze?

193
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:53,000
And the other one said no, but I made love for an hour

194
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
And you were unaware

195
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:59,000
This is the guy who set up the popcorn dick trick

196
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Cut a hole in the bottom of the popcorn

197
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
I like this guy

198
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
What's up with that language?

199
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
I can't say popcorn?

200
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:11,000
It's America's birthday, could we maybe keep it down a little?

201
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Yahoo Answers user Jessica asks, can I hit American men?

202
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:21,000
She expounds, hi, I am Jessica from France

203
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:24,000
And this fall I will be going to college in the US

204
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,000
I just wondered, if dirty American boy tries to hit on me

205
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Can I slap him hard in the mouth with clenched fists so his yellow teeth breaks?

206
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Only French man can touch this, will this get me in trouble?

207
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
No, I think that's fine

208
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Yeah, I don't know much about the law

209
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:44,000
I mean, if you make his yellow teeth breaks

210
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Then he could make you pay for it, the operation

211
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Listen, on this, America's birthday, I feel like I have to be the one to say

212
00:09:53,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Jessica, you would be lucky, lucky to have some American penis, go on

213
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Again with the language

214
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
I said penis this time, how is that not better?

215
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
It's like weirder, it's grosser

216
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Is it grosser?

217
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
It's grosser degrees

218
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
You're making me more and more uncomfortable

219
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
I'm going to eat some American wieners later

220
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:18,000
But those are called freedom franks because we can't say French dogs anymore

221
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
So they're freedom franks

222
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
Like we all used to

223
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:26,000
If he comes to the US and hits an American man in the mouth, I'll go to war with France

224
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
It'll be my own private campaign

225
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
Your own private campaign

226
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,000
Do you think Tristan would come help you out with that?

227
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Tristan's going to come and he's going to fuck Jessica up

228
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:39,000
Right now I can picture Tristan listening to this podcast and hearing that question

229
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:43,000
And just start smearing on war paint and tying a bandana around his head

230
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Well, now it's time to go get Jessica too

231
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:53,000
He's going to hog tie Jessica and use Jessica to beat Osama to death

232
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:56,000
It's going to be totally awesome

233
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:01,000
I think Jacob just had sex with me

234
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:06,000
Wow, I did not see that coming

235
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:10,000
There's a joke in there somewhere

236
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
No, I'm seeing something coming

237
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
No, go on

238
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
On America's birthday, Travis

239
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:19,000
I work with many interesting people

240
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:22,000
This is not true of me, this is Dan from Gmail

241
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:25,000
It is true of me, I'm just not the one talking

242
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
It's not my question

243
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:33,000
One in particular has a disturbing mustache that looks like he would drive an ice cream truck and have a basement full of children

244
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:38,000
How do I nicely inform him that his mustache is a sad and failed attempt at having facial hair?

245
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
Oh, the pedo stache, that's tough

246
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:47,000
I don't understand, so he's a part time ice cream truck driver and a part time day care attendee?

247
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:50,000
Dead children

248
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:54,000
Or maybe the children are manufacturing the ice cream for him

249
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:58,000
He has a slave labor thing going on in his basement

250
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:02,000
I don't think we should jump to pedo conclusions

251
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:05,000
Let's give this guy the benefit of the doubt

252
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:12,000
You think that he's worried because the guy that he works with is interesting but looks like he might run a small business

253
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:18,000
And also employ local children and be infusing cash into the economy, that's what you think

254
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
That's what he's worried about

255
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
The American economy

256
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
Happy birthday America

257
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
Thank you America

258
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
Thank you America for everything

259
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
Such a good country

260
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:38,000
I think this would be such an awkward conversation that what you need to do is sneak into his house when he's asleep

261
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:41,000
Shave it off when he's not paying attention

262
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:44,000
And then just say, what happened the next day?

263
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
If I might suggest, get Jacob's help

264
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:49,000
Yeah, get Jacob's help, he's really good with stealth

265
00:12:49,000 --> 00:13:00,000
I can't grow hair in the area underneath the corners of my mouth

266
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:03,000
Which makes it hard to go with a full goatee

267
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:08,000
And sort of ends up with a half van dyke, half pedo stash

268
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
It's a no-tee

269
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
It's a no-tee

270
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:15,000
And I sympathize with this guy

271
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:19,000
Because it's every man's right to have facial hair

272
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:22,000
Only some people are better at it than others

273
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:26,000
Travis has a full luscious beard that you could hide skittles and jolly ranchers in

274
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:29,000
To recall for later snacking

275
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:32,000
But I can't get that going

276
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:40,000
Dan, if I might suggest, start posting pictures in your cubicle of men with these pedo stashes

277
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
Like Jeffrey Dahmer

278
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
Guys like this, until eventually this guy

279
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:47,000
Now, this will reflect poorly on you

280
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
So you need to be ready for that

281
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
But I think that's the only way to do it without just saying

282
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
Hey creep stash, how's your creep stash?

283
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:56,000
The best way to deal with a creep stash is say

284
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:01,000
At any opportunity, say, God, your mustache looks so good

285
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
And like really let him know

286
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:06,000
And then say, you know what, I love your stash

287
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
And if he's into it, if he's feeling you

288
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:11,000
Okay, if he's not feeling it, he's like, oh man

289
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
This guy is hitting on me for my stash, I'm gonna shave it

290
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:16,000
If he is into it, then say, God, you know what though

291
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:19,000
As much as I love your stash, you look so good with like

292
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:22,000
A little beard, just a little beard coming down off of it

293
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
And then he'll grow it

294
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:27,000
What if you had a mustache, but it was made of skin

295
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
Like a skin stash

296
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
There wasn't any hair there

297
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
And it was just skin that blended with your other skin

298
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
That would look so good if you had a skin stash

299
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,000
That would look so, so good

300
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
So, I hope that helps

301
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:43,000
Brendan from Gmail says, I was walking with probably best friend

302
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:46,000
She has made it clear that I am in her friend's circle

303
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:50,000
Although the way she said it also said that to who is not

304
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
Okay, nope

305
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,000
Nope

306
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:56,000
Sorry Brendan, maybe get that stuff right

307
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:59,000
I can't do this with you

308
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:03,000
Tyler from Gmail writes, my friend and I live in LA

309
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
We love it

310
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:11,000
Whatever he talks about going to any place outside the city

311
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:14,000
He refers to it as going down to whateversburg

312
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:17,000
Regardless of the town's location, north or south of Los Angeles

313
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:21,000
Does he also say that regardless of the name of the area you're going to

314
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
Going down to whateversburg

315
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
That tells me nothing

316
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
There's no information in that sentence

317
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
You say that every time we go anywhere

318
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:32,000
Likewise, if we're heading into the city from some place north

319
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
He says heading up to LA

320
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:38,000
So to recap, he thinks that if you're going to a bigger city

321
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:41,000
Then you call it going up to that place

322
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:45,000
Even though the larger city may be located more southern on the actual globe

323
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
Even on the same latitude

324
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
He listened to the show and his name is Mark

325
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:53,000
Please tell me he's wrong so I can have this one trivial but incontrovertible moment

326
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
Of being right to lord over him for all of time

327
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:58,000
Help me Mo Bim Bam, you're my only hope

328
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,000
Tyler from Gmail

329
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
Okay, let me think about this

330
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:08,000
Tyler, I'm sorry but I feel what Mark is spitting

331
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:11,000
I understand it because it has nothing to do with geography

332
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:16,000
He's talking about moving up and down the socio-economic ladder

333
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:20,000
So if you move from Shitsville to LA

334
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:23,000
That is an upward move on the ladder

335
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
So you're moving on up to LA

336
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:31,000
What is this ladder that there are places below Los Angeles

337
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:35,000
I'm figuratively speaking

338
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:39,000
If we're talking about this soul crushing ladder

339
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000
LA is the bottom rung

340
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:44,000
Because it's the most oppressive city on the planet

341
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:50,000
Now you don't mean that, Las Vegas still exists

342
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:55,000
Los Angeles, you're a fine city

343
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:58,000
You need to get a little smaller

344
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:01,000
And make it so the traffic isn't so bad

345
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,000
And then we'll talk again

346
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
And make everybody less hateful

347
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
I think people are nice to me there

348
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
Do you think it's because you're white?

349
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:11,000
That probably, maybe, I don't know

350
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:16,000
Everyone there is very friendly I think in Los Angeles

351
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:19,000
To get back to Tyler's actual question

352
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:22,000
I have to agree with your friend Mark

353
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:26,000
I think that up and down are interchangeable

354
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:29,000
And have nothing to do with actual location

355
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
Would you prefer if he was like

356
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:34,000
I'm going to head up north on California 1

357
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:37,000
For 364 miles until I reach my destination

358
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:40,000
Which is LAX

359
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
I always use the right words

360
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
Is that you, Wood?

361
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,000
Like directionally?

362
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
I always say I'm heading

363
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,000
I don't say I'm going to Cincinnati

364
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:52,000
I say I'm headed north-northwest

365
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
You don't do that

366
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,000
Yeah I do, sure

367
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:58,000
As the crow flies

368
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,000
You know what I would like to hear

369
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:02,000
Those ones that are on the same plane

370
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,000
The same latitude

371
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:06,000
Say I'm heading left to someplace

372
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
I'm going up north, down south

373
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
Left, right

374
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
I'm going right

375
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
Yahoo Answers user Steph P. asks

376
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:17,000
Is it possible to bend air, water, fire, and earth

377
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
Like in Avatar?

378
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:22,000
If so, please help me learn how to

379
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,000
Subquestion

380
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:26,000
Like in the show Avatar

381
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:29,000
Yes, the answer, of course

382
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
It's also possible to bend sadness

383
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:34,000
And you've got that down

384
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
She's the last of the sadness benders

385
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
You've bent my mouth into a frown

386
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:41,000
A disapproving frown

387
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:44,000
Steph P. the frown bender

388
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:47,000
I can't wait to see M. Night Shyamalan

389
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
Ruin that franchise

390
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,000
Don't say that

391
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,000
I hope it's so good

392
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,000
It's not

393
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,000
It's got like a 6%

394
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,000
Have you seen Last Airbender?

395
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,000
That shit rules

396
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,000
Shyamalan

397
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,000
Shyamalan

398
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,000
Shyamalan

399
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,000
Shyamalan

400
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
Shyamalian

401
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,000
forms

402
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,000
Chameleonare

403
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:06,000
Chameleonare asks

404
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
What are your guys' stance on the changing of last names

405
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,000
When people get married?

406
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,000
My current girlfriend just told me

407
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,000
That if we ever got married

408
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
She would be keeping her last name

409
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,000
She claims it's a sexist tradition

410
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
Should I be offended?

411
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,000
Just say

412
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,000
You know what else is a sexist tradition

413
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,000
It would be paying for dinner

414
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
So pony up

415
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,000
Say that

416
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,000
And then she'd be like

417
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,000
Well, we always do that

418
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,000
You'd be like

419
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,000
God, I'm sorry

420
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,000
I'm such an asshole

421
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
Can you forgive me?

422
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,000
I mean

423
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:34,000
Is it a sexist tradition?

424
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
I don't know

425
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
Is it everything?

426
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,000
Isn't everything?

427
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,000
What?

428
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:43,000
Isn't every tradition inherently sexist?

429
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,000
Like you bring a Christmas tree in

430
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
That's just a phallus

431
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,000
It's just one

432
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,000
A big green leafy

433
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:51,000
Just a big green leafy phallus

434
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,000
See, that's the words we use, Travis

435
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,000
Phallus

436
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
Phallus is less creepy

437
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,000
That's the least creepy one

438
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,000
That's scientific

439
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,000
Yeah

440
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,000
That's hospital talk

441
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
I think wiener is pretty scientific

442
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,000
Oh my god

443
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,000
Oh my god

444
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,000
He's saying it again

445
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:08,000
I mean

446
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:13,000
Her preference is the most important thing, right?

447
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,000
So if

448
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:19,000
I don't think she's the sort of lady who is independent

449
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,000
About not changing her name

450
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:25,000
Until two guys

451
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,000
Three guys who are brothers

452
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,000
And record a podcast

453
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,000
Tell her differently

454
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,000
So I think you're just going to have to ride this one out

455
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
That said

456
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
If you were going to do a compromise

457
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,000
You see my wife's name

458
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:39,000
She took her last name and made it her middle name

459
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,000
And then took my last name

460
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,000
So we'd have

461
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,000
I think it's nice that married couples have the same last names

462
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,000
Because I think it's

463
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,000
Yeah

464
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,000
I think beyond being

465
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,000
Whether or not it's a sexist tradition

466
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:53,000
I think that it is nice for them to

467
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,000
Have

468
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,000
If they're starting a family

469
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,000
Then they want to be the whatevers

470
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,000
Sure

471
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:01,000
I think this issue really boils down ultimately

472
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,000
To what the last name in question is

473
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,000
I guess if it's

474
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
If it's like

475
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,000
J.P. Gargle Stinch

476
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,000
Like

477
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,000
I can understand you not wanting

478
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,000
But if it's like Hogan

479
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,000
If your last name's Hogan

480
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,000
Like what woman wouldn't want to have that as their last name

481
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,000
Right

482
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
And I think you should also explain to her

483
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,000
That she should be prepared

484
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,000
That for the rest of your lives together

485
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,000
You will always be introduced separately

486
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,000
And everything will be addressed to you separately

487
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,000
And there will always be that confusion of

488
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,000
It would be awkward

489
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
Like this is Mrs. Gargle Stouch

490
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,000
And her husband

491
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,000
Tom Danger

492
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,000
Like well Mrs. Gargle Stouch what didn't you

493
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,000
Never mind

494
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,000
And she can't be Mrs.

495
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,000
She can't be Mrs.

496
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,000
Can you be Mrs. if you don't take their last name

497
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,000
I think so

498
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,000
I think Mrs. just indicates that you're married

499
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,000
I'm pretty sure it's pronounced Mizz-rizz

500
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,000
Mizz-rizz

501
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,000
Mizz

502
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,000
Yeah

503
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,000
Mizz-mires

504
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,000
Mizz-rizz

505
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,000
Formspring asks

506
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,000
I just started seeing this guy and I feel uncomfortable

507
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,000
Whenever he tries to take my shirt off

508
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,000
I like him a lot but I'm not a skinny girl

509
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,000
And I feel like he won't like what he sees underneath

510
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:04,000
Do men even care or do they just want boobs

511
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,000
Good news

512
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:11,000
Listen the doctor just came out of the room

513
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,000
You've been sitting there in the waiting room

514
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:16,000
With bated breath waiting for something

515
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,000
And Dr. Travis has good news for you

516
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:21,000
Men like boobs

517
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,000
There you go

518
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,000
It doesn't matter to me

519
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:28,000
What if these are not two connected thoughts

520
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:35,000
We're assuming that she means she's a little bit chunky style underneath

521
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:38,000
And that's why she's worried what he'll see

522
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,000
Maybe she's got like a really tragic

523
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:47,000
Maybe she's got like a giant tattoo of Ray Romano or something

524
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:50,000
Maybe she's got a side butt but it's on her torso

525
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:54,000
Oh my god a torso side butt and you're embarrassed that he'll see it

526
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:59,000
Listen if he loves you he's gonna have to deal with the fact that you have half a butt on the side of your body

527
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:03,000
And a tattoo of Ray Romano

528
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,000
I understand you were attached to it

529
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:10,000
Maybe have it surgically lowered so it'll just look like you have great childbearing hips

530
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:15,000
Why would having a tattoo of Ray Romano lower make it look like you have great childbearing hips

531
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,000
I'm really confused

532
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:20,000
It's about perspective

533
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,000
It's hard to explain

534
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:27,000
If he loves you it won't matter and if he doesn't love you don't give it up

535
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,000
There it is man

536
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,000
Lock it up, lock it down

537
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,000
Words never spoken

538
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,000
Protect that carnal treasure

539
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,000
That's right that's your flower

540
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:42,000
Does anyone here find Michael Cera really attractive

541
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:45,000
Sorry that was a yahoo question

542
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:48,000
You need to prep this shit like that Griffin

543
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:52,000
I didn't want to dedicate too much time to it so I just dropped it like it was hot

544
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,000
I don't know why but I really really like him

545
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:57,000
I just think it's his amazing personality lol

546
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:04,000
Go creepo you're the only one

547
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,000
No I think he's cute

548
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,000
He's a cute little guy

549
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,000
The thing is he's 50

550
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:14,000
It's getting a little old, a little tired

551
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:17,000
He needs to bust out of his shell a little bit

552
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:20,000
Ye three brothers

553
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:23,000
My best friend is a bit of a dick

554
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:25,000
Again with this talk

555
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:27,000
He takes the piss out of it

556
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:33,000
He takes the piss out of everything I say and bitches about me constantly

557
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,000
How could I put him in his place

558
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:41,000
Okay welcome back to fucking class 1000

559
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:45,000
A continuing series on my brother my brother news called are you my friend

560
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:52,000
Class 1 was of course if you want to really have sex with your best friend's girlfriend really bad

561
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,000
That's not your friend

562
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,000
You're not friends that's not what that means

563
00:24:56,000 --> 00:25:03,000
Class 2 if your best friend makes fun of everything you say and bitches about you

564
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:05,000
He's not your friend

565
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:07,000
Find a new friend

566
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:11,000
What kind of confidence issues do you have

567
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:15,000
Where this guy is picking on you all the time and makes fun of you and bitches about you

568
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,000
You're like that's my best bud

569
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:19,000
That's my bro

570
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:21,000
A lifetime bro forever

571
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:23,000
He has my best interest in mind

572
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:27,000
I know that he pees all over me and sets my stuff on fire and kicks me in the face

573
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:29,000
But god I love him

574
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:31,000
Hey Tony you're a pussy

575
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:33,000
Thanks Mike

576
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:35,000
That's my best friend

577
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:37,000
How many more boxes do you think we have to move to your apartment

578
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:41,000
I'll tell you when you move enough boxes gay

579
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:43,000
That's my best friend

580
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:45,000
That's my man

581
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:47,000
Who's that man abusing you

582
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:49,000
Do you want me to call the cops now we're bros

583
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:51,000
We're best friends

584
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:53,000
That said

585
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:55,000
Hey Jerry I fucked your dad

586
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:57,000
Oh Mike

587
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:59,000
Thanks

588
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:01,000
Why'd you do that

589
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:03,000
How about you just tell him to stop being a dick

590
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:05,000
Stop being a dick

591
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:07,000
Just slug him once

592
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:09,000
Just slug him once

593
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,000
And see how the tenure of the relationship changes

594
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:13,000
I bet it'll be drastic

595
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:15,000
Real good for that friendship

596
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:19,000
You guys are so chipper and gleeful

597
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:21,000
You're never down

598
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:23,000
How do you do this

599
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:25,000
This dovetails

600
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,000
This dovetails with another question that's from Matt

601
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:29,000
The theory of you seem to be great terms as adults

602
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:31,000
Were you always good friends or does that

603
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:33,000
Amicable nature of family just

604
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:35,000
Naturally reveal itself after you no longer

605
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:37,000
Have to share a living space

606
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:39,000
Yep

607
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:41,000
These questions are tied in because

608
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:43,000
You don't know us

609
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:45,000
We're animals, we're monsters

610
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:47,000
This show

611
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:49,000
Is our ticket

612
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,000
To the big time, to the big money

613
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:53,000
And we know that we're the only three people

614
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:55,000
We know that will be on it with us

615
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:57,000
So we

616
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:59,000
We act chipper

617
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:01,000
But usually we're hateful

618
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:03,000
And misanthrope

619
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:05,000
This question reminds me of people who are like

620
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:07,000
That Matt Lauer seems so nice

621
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:09,000
Well that's his job

622
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:11,000
That's what he gets paid to do

623
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:13,000
Our job is to make it seem like we like each other

624
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:15,000
And that we're chipper

625
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:17,000
They're lying by the way

626
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:19,000
We're chipper and gleeful because we

627
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:21,000
Enjoy talking to each other

628
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:23,000
I'll tell you straight up

629
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:25,000
Stone Cold

630
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:27,000
This is from Matt

631
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:29,000
Matt I'll tell you something

632
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:31,000
Man you only get one go around

633
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:33,000
You only get one spin

634
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:35,000
On this crazy globe

635
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:37,000
Why waste a moment of it

636
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:39,000
Not one more moment of it being

637
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:41,000
Anything but chipper and gleeful

638
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:43,000
I have a great reason to be chipper and gleeful

639
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:45,000
It's because I woke up today

640
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:47,000
You know what I have a new thing that I've been trying

641
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,000
To do for like the last year, year and a half, two years

642
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,000
And whenever I start to get frustrated

643
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:53,000
About something or upset about something I stop

644
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:55,000
And I think is this really worth getting

645
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:57,000
Upset about and the answer is always

646
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:59,000
No, you know in

647
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:01,000
Two minutes it's gonna be over anyways

648
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:03,000
Might as well ride

649
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:05,000
The happy wave

650
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:07,000
If that doesn't work just go buy

651
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:09,000
Something

652
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:11,000
That's what I do

653
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:13,000
I'll go back to my original point and

654
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:15,000
Make that something just a little bit

655
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:17,000
Of speed

656
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:19,000
Just a little bit of

657
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:21,000
Upper, maybe just one rock

658
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:23,000
Just one rock of rock cocaine

659
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:25,000
But it's important that you promise yourself

660
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:27,000
Great speed powder, just the one

661
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:29,000
Maybe just a little

662
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:31,000
Bit of nose whiskey

663
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:33,000
We'll turn that frown upside down

664
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:35,000
As a woman what is

665
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:37,000
The best way to seduce a man?

666
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:39,000
Say hi, I can't answer that

667
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:41,000
As a man the best way to seduce a man

668
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:43,000
Goes a little something

669
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:45,000
Like this

670
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:49,000
Then it's

671
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:51,000
On, just like that I don't know

672
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:53,000
That's all you need, just make that noise

673
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:55,000
And the guy's like you're down

674
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:57,000
Then you're like I'm down, clearly I'm down

675
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:59,000
As a woman, what seduction

676
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:01,000
What do you mean, there's no seduction

677
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:03,000
There's no, I mean this is

678
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:05,000
A crazy concept

679
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:07,000
Men are stupid, just

680
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:09,000
Penises attached to brains, I'm sorry Griffin

681
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:11,000
And it

682
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:13,000
Takes very little

683
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:15,000
What's the best way to seduce a dude guys?

684
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:17,000
I think maybe a little bit of

685
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:19,000
I think maybe a little bit of clarity

686
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:21,000
Will come out of

687
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:23,000
This related yahoo question

688
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:25,000
Which comes to us from Mr. H

689
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:27,000
Who asks, exactly how

690
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:29,000
Can I get horny?

691
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:31,000
I don't

692
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:33,000
I don't get it

693
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:35,000
I look at something sexual and dirty

694
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:37,000
And then what, do I have to have a specific

695
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:39,000
Mindset to get fully horny?

696
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:41,000
I tried saying over and over

697
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:43,000
In my head, oh god I want that so

698
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:45,000
Badly, or something like that

699
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:47,000
That didn't help

700
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:49,000
Am I supposed to get a big emotional feeling when I

701
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:51,000
Get horny? Is it like my heartbeat

702
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:53,000
Changes during horniness?

703
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:55,000
What aspect of the

704
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:57,000
Dirty thought is supposed to make me horny?

705
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:59,000
I looked at something that made me

706
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:01,000
Horny, but it only worked for a few seconds

707
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:03,000
And then it went away

708
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:05,000
And sometimes it doesn't work at all

709
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:07,000
What do I have to do to keep the feeling?

710
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:09,000
This is once again something a psychopath

711
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:11,000
Says

712
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:13,000
Signed Kyle H5

713
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:15,000
Someone give me a real answer

714
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:17,000
Nothing like, you'll know when it happens

715
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:19,000
That's the most

716
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:21,000
Upsetting thing I've ever heard

717
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:23,000
Clearly dating

718
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:25,000
Clearly these two are

719
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:27,000
She doesn't know how to seduce a man, and he does not

720
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:29,000
Understand horny

721
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:31,000
He doesn't understand how to be seduced

722
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:33,000
That question

723
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:35,000
By the way, came to us from

724
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:37,000
Tyler, who sent it in

725
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:39,000
Thank you Tyler

726
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:41,000
That's a good one, good looking out money

727
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:43,000
Good looking out money

728
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:45,000
I think this might have been

729
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:47,000
Sent to us by Beesbow, or some other

730
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:49,000
Extraterrestrial force that doesn't understand

731
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:51,000
How horny impulses work

732
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:53,000
I think just

733
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:55,000
Scientifically speaking, if you ever said

734
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:57,000
To yourself, oh I'm down

735
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:59,000
To bone, then you're probably horny right then

736
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:01,000
You don't need to, there's no

737
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:03,000
Horny fairy that comes down and says to you

738
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:05,000
You are on

739
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:07,000
You are on and ready for game

740
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:09,000
Dear horny fairy, please send me

741
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,000
A boner, it's all I want

742
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:13,000
Just one please

743
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:15,000
Send me a bone

744
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:17,000
Give just one boner to

745
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:19,000
Me

746
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:21,000
My advice to both of these people, the young people

747
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:23,000
And the former string person

748
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:25,000
In my experience

749
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:27,000
It's all about the atmosphere

750
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:29,000
And just

751
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:31,000
You know

752
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:33,000
And by which I mean, is there a dude

753
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:35,000
Present and is there a girl present?

754
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:37,000
Atmosphere completed

755
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:39,000
Yeah, and then just start kissing

756
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:41,000
Did you try to start kissing?

757
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:43,000
That's always a good start

758
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:45,000
Why do you have to jump right to

759
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:47,000
Having sex?

760
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:49,000
You have to take your clothes off and kiss

761
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:51,000
Nothing makes me hornier than a good

762
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:53,000
Conversation

763
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:55,000
Which is really awkward when talking

764
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:57,000
To Griffin

765
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:59,000
Is it awkward?

766
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:01,000
Help

767
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:03,000
Help

768
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:05,000
I need to get my girlfriend back, any advice

769
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:07,000
Brothers? This comes from Form Spring

770
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:09,000
How bad was the

771
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:11,000
Prank that she pulled on you that you want to get revenge for?

772
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:13,000
Is that what he means?

773
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:15,000
Do you want to get back at her for a prank she pulled?

774
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:17,000
Either that or she was kidnapped

775
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:19,000
I think she's been taken by Colombian drug runners

776
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:21,000
At which point, call Kiefer Sunderland

777
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:23,000
Yeah, he'll sort that out

778
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:25,000
Here's what I would do, I would wait until you know

779
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:27,000
She's going to walk into her room, then you get a bucket

780
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:29,000
You fill the bucket with water, then you put the water bucket

781
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:31,000
Half on the door jamb

782
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:33,000
And half on the door

783
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:35,000
And then when she opens the door

784
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:37,000
It all tumbles onto her

785
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:39,000
She'll get

786
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:41,000
She'll get moist from the water in the bucket

787
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:43,000
That's what you're saying

788
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:45,000
This works both ways, if she broke up

789
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:47,000
With you, if she pulled a prank on you

790
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:49,000
Then you point at her after the water bucket

791
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:51,000
Falls on her and you

792
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:53,000
Laugh, if she dumped you

793
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:55,000
Then you point at her and say

794
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:57,000
Well no one will have you now

795
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:59,000
I'm the best you're going to do

796
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:01,000
And the best you're going to do, Weddy

797
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:03,000
Take a picture of her

798
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:05,000
Film it and put it on YouTube and say

799
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:07,000
Be a little fool of yourself and then walk away

800
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:09,000
That's going viral

801
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:11,000
I'll see you this evening

802
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:13,000
For dinner, we have dinner at Giovanni's

803
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:15,000
A reservation

804
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:17,000
I'll see you there, have you guys seen the bucket ex

805
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:19,000
Oh she's so foolish

806
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:21,000
No one would ever date her

807
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:25,000
I'd say I guess I just put

808
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:27,000
Hooking up with me back on your bucket

809
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:29,000
List and then walk out

810
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:31,000
That's real good, that's a good one

811
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:33,000
That's real good

812
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:35,000
For real though, you don't need her

813
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:37,000
You're too good for her

814
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:39,000
You listen to a great podcast like this

815
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:41,000
Unless it's like a

816
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:43,000
Justifiable reason that she broke up with you

817
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:45,000
Like you need to quit doing

818
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:47,000
Speed

819
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:49,000
Or pranks

820
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:51,000
Listen, it was funny the first time

821
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:53,000
You have done the bucket thing

822
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:55,000
26 times and it is

823
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:57,000
Old

824
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:59,000
Until you get a tattoo that says I'm the trickster supreme

825
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:01,000
I'm not going to stop pulling pranks

826
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:03,000
Trickster supreme with an

827
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:05,000
XXX

828
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:07,000
I want to hear Griffin's last question but first I want to tell you

829
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:09,000
All the different ways that you can seek help from

830
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:11,000
Our show, there is

831
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:13,000
Of course an email address

832
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:15,000
M-B-M-B-A-M at gmail.com

833
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:17,000
There's form spring

834
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:19,000
It's form spring

835
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:21,000
Something

836
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:25,000
I think it's like form spring dot me

837
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:27,000
You really need to nail

838
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:29,000
Down that web address

839
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:31,000
I don't know that one so just go to

840
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:33,000
M-B-M-B-A-M dot com and all these methods

841
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:35,000
Are on there, we love seeing

842
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:37,000
Retweeted quotes

843
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:39,000
We have a search so we always see those

844
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:41,000
And

845
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:43,000
Those always bring us a lot of joy

846
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:45,000
If you could grab a friend

847
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:47,000
The next time you listen to the show

848
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:49,000
Or burn a CD for them

849
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:51,000
It would be

850
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:53,000
Great too, just put a couple Eps on it

851
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:55,000
And say hey listen to this

852
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:57,000
I know you will like this

853
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:59,000
Enjoy this

854
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:01,000
I'll tell you a campaign I'm going to try and get started

855
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:03,000
I was looking at our stats the other day

856
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:05,000
Our statistics and almost half of the people

857
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:07,000
That listen to our show download it through the web

858
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:09,000
You got to get on that iTunes

859
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:11,000
It's so efficient

860
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:13,000
It's such an efficient way of getting the show

861
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:15,000
You just put it in

862
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:17,000
And then you hit the subscribe button

863
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:19,000
And then you get it automatically every week

864
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:21,000
It's just waiting there for you

865
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:23,000
And if I might suggest subscribe

866
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:25,000
And then just download it independently

867
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:27,000
Seven times

868
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:29,000
Just get it as many times as you can

869
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:31,000
But tell a friend

870
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:33,000
I was talking with my buddy Slice

871
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:35,000
Who was telling me all the different

872
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:37,000
Ways he's come up with to share the show

873
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:41,000
And I think that's about it

874
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:45,000
And I'm ready

875
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:47,000
Travis if you are

876
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:49,000
To hear our last question

877
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:51,000
Our one to grow on

878
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:53,000
Comes to us from Yahoo Answers user Rick

879
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:55,000
Who asks, I just got out of jail

880
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:57,000
When is NWA

881
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:59,000
World Championship Wrestling on?

882
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:07,000
I'm Justin McElroy

883
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:09,000
I'm Travis McElroy

884
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:11,000
And this has been my brother, my brother

885
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:13,000
And me

886
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:23,000
You'll never know me

887
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:45,000
Yeah
