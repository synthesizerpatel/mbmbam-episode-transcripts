1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:31,840
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:47,040
Hello everybody, and welcome to my brother and my brother and me, an advice show for the modern

6
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:51,440
era. Around these parts they call me Justin McElroy. I'm your oldest brother. I'm your

7
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:57,280
middle-est brother, and people know me as Travis McElroy, for as far as they know.

8
00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:03,040
Oh, and I'm your sweet baby brother, Griffin McElroy. You might know my Deep Web username

9
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:18,080
as Bitcoin Skrillex Dog Boner 420... 4206969. Boys, I wanted to talk to you guys about something

10
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:25,200
that is a new sort of concern, a new interest, a new worldview that I've only sort of recently

11
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:29,520
adopted, but it has become basically instantly very, very important to me, basically all consuming.

12
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:33,840
Because I don't know about how you guys feel, but like I've been looking at the success of our

13
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:38,560
show and just the millions that we're making off of it, and I'm thinking about like,

14
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:45,280
I'm trying to think about like what we've given back, just like not with the money, like the

15
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:51,760
money's fucking ours, obviously, but like... They'll get their cut with the estate tax.

16
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:57,680
Right. I think you mean the Barack Hussein Obama's death tax.

17
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:00,080
You know, a lot of people forget about the Hussein.

18
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:03,840
A lot of people do, and I think it's important. Anyway, there's a concern that I want to talk

19
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:07,840
about, and I think it's like a way that the three of us can really channel our power and use it for

20
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:13,440
good, use our broad reach for good. I want to talk to you about a Twitter user who tweeted at me

21
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:22,320
a little over one hour ago, and this Twitter user's handle is BubbleJug1. Okay. Uh-huh. Now,

22
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:28,720
you may remember BubbleJug as being the... I'm going to put quotes, big heavy quotes, bold,

23
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:37,360
all caps quotes, candy made by Nestle, part of the Hubba Bubba franchise, and it was bubble gum

24
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:44,160
that came in a powdered form in a little nasty jug. Oh my God, I remember that nasty jug. Yeah, I remember that skank

25
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:50,160
jug. You remember that skanky jug full of that basically gum dirt that you would put in your

26
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:57,760
mouth and then keep it there like a chore until gum happened. Uh-huh. It was like space age,

27
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:06,080
the dipping dots of gum. Yeah, it was certainly dipping because it was gum-based snus, and it was

28
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:11,680
as delicious as that sounds. I would love to sing for you the ballad of BubbleJug, this Twitter user

29
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:17,360
who has at this moment five tweets, and the five tweets starts off just sort of a shot across the

30
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:22,320
fucking America's bow. It is time for the global community to finally put their minds toward a goal

31
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:27,280
worthy of our genius. Hubba Bubba, bring back BubbleJug. Just like putting that out there, and

32
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:34,000
then in a separate tweet, hashtags, bring back BubbleJug and jug life. So they know exactly

33
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:40,320
what they're doing here. By the way, if you take this segment as you're going to fucking make a

34
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:46,160
revive Tastation's Twitter account and start haranguing, this is a once in a lifetime lightning

35
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:52,480
in a bottle. This was a perfect series of tweets. Griffin, can I recommend a name for the movement

36
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:57,440
or for the group that's in the movement? I mean, jug life is already very good, but go ahead.

37
00:03:57,440 --> 00:04:03,520
BubbleJuggalos? It's very, very good also. Also very good. Damn it. So a little over an hour ago,

38
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:10,320
I got a tweet from BubbleJug. It said, as a true visionary DM and father of digital monsters,

39
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:13,680
you should get behind our movement to bring back BubbleJug, hashtag jug life. That's great.

40
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:20,720
Wait, so is BubbleJug no number taken? Is there already an app BubbleJug, so they had to be

41
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:24,800
BubbleJug one? I mean, Nestle probably has it locked down so that somebody doesn't

42
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:29,840
misrepresent the brand because they'll never bring it back. It's an egg. BubbleJug's an egg.

43
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:33,360
Is it tweeting like mean things that like- Nope, nothing.

44
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:36,160
Women in the games industry? No. Take this fucking bazooka, Joe.

45
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:44,560
BubbleJug has one, has two other tweets, and these tweets are to two other people,

46
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:50,320
and they are, I'm honored to be like among this sort of assembly of people that BubbleJug one

47
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:58,000
thinks is capable of getting this brand, just breathing the sweet creative breath of life

48
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:02,640
back into the lungs of the BubbleJug brand, because that list, according to BubbleJug one,

49
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:08,160
is myself and then Sean Puffy Combs. Right.

50
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:13,280
And then, of course, Lil Wayne, the Lillest of Waynes.

51
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:18,160
Have the three of you gotten together for your G8 summit this year yet,

52
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:22,080
or is that happening like in the- We just call ourselves the three Gs,

53
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:26,320
and you know that. They call it the GR8 summit. It's great.

54
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:31,520
And they're getting the jug up and running. I mean, this has certainly moved up my- Oh,

55
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:34,160
Justin, I see you've gone ahead and followed BubbleJug one.

56
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:39,600
No fucking question. Absolutely, Griffin. One thing that I like about BubbleJug,

57
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:45,520
and it's hard to pick just one, but what I like about it is you think about the four

58
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:50,400
first tweets as like a volume one of this Twitter account.

59
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:52,480
All these happened on May 24th. Yeah.

60
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:54,800
These, the first four. They said, okay,

61
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:59,200
I'm bringing back BubbleJug. Great start. Here's some hashtags for the movement. Cool.

62
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:04,080
And they said, I'm going to get the global community to put their minds to this.

63
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:08,560
I got to get some attention. Who are some people I know that can help bring back BubbleJug?

64
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:13,200
Well, Lil Wayne, got it. Okay, Puff Daddy, I'm out. That's it.

65
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:16,320
Those are the two that I can come up with. Hopefully I'll come up with somebody else soon.

66
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:20,640
Five days later. What about Griffin? Yeah, got to get Griffin on board.

67
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:25,120
First of all, BubbleJug one, I appreciate your enthusiasm. I'm considering your offer.

68
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:28,080
I'd love to leave a legacy. I've been listening to a lot of Hamilton,

69
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:34,400
and that's basically what this is about. Sure. You want something that's going to outlive you.

70
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:39,520
My sweet, sweet, dusty gum. Your BubbleJuggery.

71
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:45,120
I would love to read the product details on the candystore.com website.

72
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:49,440
Untwist the cap to access the candy gum hidden inside. Pour them in your hand

73
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:53,040
or directly into your mouth to taste deliciously sweet bubble gum flavor.

74
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:58,240
BubbleJugs are very different from pieces or sticks of gum. Each contains a powder candy.

75
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:03,200
When chewed, the candy turns into bubble gum. It's almost like having two confections in one.

76
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:05,520
Eat my asshole, candystore website.

77
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:16,400
If you first, okay, if I put the dust in my mouth and just thinking about that is like,

78
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:23,840
like I'm getting like shaky thinking about that sensation of the dust going into the mouth.

79
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:27,520
The dust, that's the worst part. Once you get, it should say that on the candy store website,

80
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:31,120
you're going to put the dust in your mouth, but eventually gum will be there where it wasn't.

81
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:35,520
And like, it's not, it is an imperfect gum delivery mechanism because essentially what

82
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:40,960
we're talking about is I'm using my mouth to cook the gum up. My mouth is,

83
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:44,560
my mouth is a little gummy oven. Your mouth, your mouth is the kiln

84
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:48,720
from which this gum will be fused. I'm Jim Nestle. Lately,

85
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:53,680
we've noticed that a lot of the sweep-ins left on the old gum making floor have just been going

86
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:59,680
to waste. Well, I said enough of that. Here's what we do at BubbleJug HQ.

87
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:05,200
We sweep up all these gum leave-ins. We put them into a jug and then you make the gum.

88
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:05,520
The jugs-

89
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:08,720
This is a task we endeavor on together.

90
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:10,640
The jug's the thing, isn't it?

91
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:10,800
It is.

92
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:13,440
Because they couldn't just, they couldn't just make a little bag.

93
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:16,720
We just sell Ziploc bags full of bubble dust.

94
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:20,720
Yeah, that would be, that's not, that's not great. So whoever thought of like,

95
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:26,240
this is the worst idea for anything to ever go into your mouth ever, but somebody was like,

96
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:29,840
well, if we put it in a fucking jug and we call it BubbleJug and we don't advertise-

97
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:32,320
Do you think they have the jugs from something else?

98
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:35,440
They're like, well, we had all these jugs because we were going to do like just

99
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:39,680
jugs full of chocolate syrup, but like nobody wanted to buy that.

100
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:45,440
Nobody wanted that because it sounds bad. BubbleJug1, your cause is true.

101
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:47,520
Your cause is righteous.

102
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:48,160
So good.

103
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:53,680
I want you to hang in there. Maybe, and this is just like, I'm not like an expert.

104
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:59,600
I think like the change.org petitions are like that whole sort of idea is just,

105
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:04,480
that's not really how the stuff works, but I will say that start, just one good starting

106
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:07,920
point is to maybe tweet this at the people who made the terrible gum to begin with.

107
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:08,800
Yeah.

108
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:11,440
Because they might have the, they are the ones who have their hand

109
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:15,120
on the assembly line switch to reactivate the bubble gum protocols.

110
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:18,800
They might be like the guy from the Rockafire Explosion documentary where they're just like

111
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:22,240
sitting on a warehouse full of BubbleJugs and they don't know what to do with them

112
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:25,440
because they don't think there's any demand for it. Exactly.

113
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:31,120
This is, this looks like fleshy sand. This looks like, this looks like what came out of

114
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:33,600
the mummy in the movie, The Mummy, when he opened his mouth.

115
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:35,920
It's what's left over if you bake clay face.

116
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:41,760
If you baked clay face, when you punch a fucking putty right in the old Z

117
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:46,480
and they disintegrate, they turn into BubbleJug. Fuck this candy.

118
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:52,160
I hope when you, when you die, you go, when you go to those pearly gates in St. Peter's

119
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:58,000
there, he's got a pie chart and he makes you go excruciatingly wedge by wedge through how

120
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:01,840
you spent your life minutes. And with this person, he's going to get to a slice where

121
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:07,200
he's like, now we come to my tastiest slice of all. This is where you spent your life

122
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:10,720
minutes making a Twitter account to bring back BubbleJug.

123
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:15,760
And I gotta tell you, me and the man upstairs, just everybody, we're really big fans of this.

124
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:23,040
This is, when we made you from like clay and dust and BubbleJug, the one thing we hoped

125
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:29,200
you guys would really do is invent BubbleJug, cancel BubbleJug, and then try to bring BubbleJug

126
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:29,600
back.

127
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:33,520
That was your 40 days in the wilderness was the time without BubbleJug.

128
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:39,040
Okay. Just, I want to move on cause we've been talking for 10 minutes about it. Long

129
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:45,040
dead candy. But the day they shut down, the day they flipped the switch on the BubbleJug

130
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:51,200
factory and then they were like, and everybody left and everybody was sad. There was somebody

131
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:55,360
left over who had destroyed, had to destroy all the BubbleJug. And you tell me how they

132
00:10:55,360 --> 00:11:00,480
accomplished that. How do you destroy that? Which has been so utterly decimated. And this

133
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:03,040
is basically gum that has been humiliated.

134
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:06,400
That was actually what they used in Are You Afraid of the Dark to get the flare ups in

135
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:08,960
the fire. Not a lot of people know that.

136
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:10,320
That was powdered coffee creamer.

137
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:11,760
Well shit.

138
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:14,480
Okay. Let's do a show.

139
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:19,040
Here's our first question. This is an advice show, by the way. We take your questions and

140
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:24,000
turn them Alchemy-like into wisdom. I have a bat flying around my apartment. I've locked

141
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:29,920
myself in my room, but I need to leave it eventually for work and shit. I figured in

142
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:32,800
your infinite wisdom, that's pretty sad commentary on our audience that this question

143
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:35,600
I actually thought that they needed to clarify why they would need to leave their apartment

144
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:40,800
ever. I figured in your infinite wisdom, you'd be able to tell me how to get, how to rid

145
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:45,760
my apartment of this befangled nightbird. Please help. That's from Not A Bat Girl.

146
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:49,760
It's actually befanged nightbird, but I love the term befangled.

147
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:58,720
That's the way you got all these new, all these new gadget bats, all these new befangled

148
00:11:58,720 --> 00:11:59,600
bats everywhere.

149
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:10,160
The one time I've had a bat in the house, our dad dressed up like a horseshit Batman

150
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:16,640
in a windbreaker and a balaclava and like goggles and-

151
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:17,680
A tennis racket?

152
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:18,880
Tennis racket.

153
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:21,520
I thought it was a broom. It might have been a tennis racket.

154
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:23,680
I think it was dual wielding.

155
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:24,800
It was dual wielding.

156
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:26,400
Yeah, that was his spec in college.

157
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:31,280
He was swinging wildly at this thing, and I don't know if you guys remember what happened

158
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:40,320
next, but our very old cat Sasha, who was basically on our very last legs at this point, leapt

159
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:47,280
vertical two feet off the couch, snatched that motherfucker out of the air, and brought

160
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:51,040
it to its final reward, and the cat took care of it.

161
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:57,120
So that would be my one first advice would be like to go the Fred Penner route, old lady

162
00:12:57,120 --> 00:13:00,320
swallowed a bat or swallowed a cat to get the bat.

163
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:03,280
Well, none of us swallowed Sasha after-

164
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:07,840
Your apartment would swallow a cat that would swallow the bat is what I'm saying.

165
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:11,520
Now I might get rabies from it is what I know, one thing about it, one problem.

166
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:16,880
If you think about it, the bat's not very big, and your apartment is probably relatively

167
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:18,400
large compared to the bat.

168
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:21,120
Maybe you just have a new shitty roommate.

169
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:22,720
I've had worse roommates than that.

170
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:26,880
You know, that's how they measure the square footage.

171
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:29,200
They don't use that to measure spaces anymore.

172
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:33,600
It's just if you get on Zillow, it's like this home is 350,000 bats.

173
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:34,880
It's measured in cubats.

174
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:38,960
Travis, that's almost a Pokemon.

175
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:41,840
Better than this.

176
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:43,120
I'm not.

177
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:44,560
It's true.

178
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:46,400
It's a good point.

179
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:46,800
Thank you.

180
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,120
How do you get rid of a bat?

181
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:51,440
I really enjoy-

182
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:52,320
Ask the Joker.

183
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:55,760
Jesus.

184
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:57,840
I'm doing a Walker Walker thing, but you can't-

185
00:13:57,840 --> 00:13:58,160
Yeah.

186
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:02,480
I really enjoy the idea that this person is just huddled in a corner waiting for this

187
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:07,600
podcast episode to drop, praying that we don't go late for Memorial Day.

188
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:09,360
Please help love a skeleton.

189
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:10,880
So hungry.

190
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:14,800
The bat's not going to hurt you, but that doesn't matter.

191
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:18,880
I know that the big, big mouse that lives in my garage isn't going to hurt me, but I

192
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:20,800
am still very afraid of him or her.

193
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:23,600
Travis, are you a mouse guy?

194
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:24,800
No.

195
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:28,080
I love Mouse Hunt with Nathan Lane.

196
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:32,320
I have a theory that everybody breaks down into mice or spider guys.

197
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:36,400
Like you're a spider guy or you're a mouse guy or mouse lady or a spider lady.

198
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:38,240
I vote no on to all.

199
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:39,280
See, I don't-

200
00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:43,120
Spiders are like not- I don't even- Spiders, I don't trip with spiders.

201
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:44,080
Like that is- That's fine.

202
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:44,720
I'll put them on.

203
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:48,640
I'll get a sheet of construction paper, scoot them onto it, take them out to freedom outside.

204
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:49,840
That does not bother me.

205
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:52,080
Mice can fuck right off.

206
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:56,720
See, for me, I'm just like a- I'm a not a small furry thing that suddenly comes out

207
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:59,120
of nowhere and moves inhumanly.

208
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:00,000
So like-

209
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:00,480
Mice.

210
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:05,360
Your mice, your spiders, your bats, snakes, lizards?

211
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:06,000
No problem.

212
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:06,560
Got nothing.

213
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:07,120
Borrowers.

214
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:08,400
No problem. Got nothing.

215
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:08,900
Borrowers.

216
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:10,880
Borrowborables.

217
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:16,240
I watched a giant groundhog out in my yard and I was watching him sort of with novelty

218
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:18,240
at first because it was like, damn.

219
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:18,800
Fuck yeah.

220
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:19,440
That's awesome.

221
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:20,400
Look at that big groundhog.

222
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:21,280
Never seen one of these.

223
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:22,560
This is amazing.

224
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:23,600
I'm looking at a groundhog.

225
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:26,640
And then I had a moment where I was like, goddammit, it's a big rat.

226
00:15:26,640 --> 00:15:27,840
And I fucking flipped.

227
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:30,960
Can you imagine if Justin saw a capybara in the wild?

228
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:31,680
Holy shit.

229
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:36,560
Well, he would be fine because he wouldn't get a second alone with that capybara if I

230
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:37,200
was around.

231
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:38,000
Don't bother me.

232
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:42,560
Don't bother me at all to see rodentia in their natural habitat, which is to say not

233
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:43,200
in my home.

234
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:44,800
I do not care to see-

235
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:49,520
Like, I don't care if squirrels are cruising around outside getting those acorns and nuts.

236
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:50,080
That's fine.

237
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:51,440
I just don't want it in my home.

238
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:54,320
You like them when they're doing hard work and preparation.

239
00:15:55,280 --> 00:15:56,880
Every one of God's creatures in their place.

240
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:57,600
That's all I'm saying.

241
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:59,120
How do you get rid of a bat?

242
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:02,160
Here, we've been fucking dancing around this issue and I think I've got it.

243
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:06,960
You just make a little trail of bananas out the front door and this is a good piece of-

244
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:08,560
This is like going to be the new-

245
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:13,360
This is going to be the new pack your bags and move away because there's so many problems

246
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:16,080
you can solve with just a big trail of bananas.

247
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:20,640
But going out the front door, you got a roommate you don't like, just banana trap them.

248
00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:26,160
Griffin, I'm sorry, but you're being short-sighted because you're just as likely to draw in a

249
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:27,280
chimpanzee.

250
00:16:27,280 --> 00:16:31,200
You made a fat landing strip out of bananas.

251
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:36,000
I was trying to get rid of a bat and I got eight more bats.

252
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:37,760
Now I got nine bats.

253
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:39,120
And a monkey.

254
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:39,840
And a monkey.

255
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:40,960
A chimpanzee came in.

256
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:45,600
I've got that scene from Ace Ventura where everything comes out of everywhere.

257
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:49,280
We got two Dunstons and a fucking- and a Kirk Cameron in here, man.

258
00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:50,160
It's rough stuff.

259
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:53,440
Kirk Cameron loves bananas.

260
00:16:53,440 --> 00:17:01,920
Now, I would have to say that monkey would temporarily fix your problem because there's

261
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:04,720
no way a monkey's going to be called a bat cruising his nanas.

262
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:06,960
I can't get off my nanas.

263
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:10,160
I would rather have a monkey too because it's easier to keep track of.

264
00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:13,840
It's less likely that I lose sight of a monkey.

265
00:17:13,840 --> 00:17:19,200
But if you do lose sight of that monkey, it's a risk reward scenario.

266
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,960
You lose sight of the bat, then you just have the constant dread of like-

267
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:25,840
There's a bat somewhere and I don't know.

268
00:17:25,840 --> 00:17:30,000
But if you lose sight of a monkey, it's like, oh my god, this is it.

269
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:33,920
But that's why I have the motivational poster that says never lose sight of the monkey.

270
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:36,640
Do you guys want a Yahoo?

271
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:37,280
I'd love that.

272
00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:40,560
I have a lot of really good ones.

273
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:43,200
Thank you to everybody who sent in Yahoo's.

274
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:48,240
If you wouldn't mind, if you could just sort of fucking flood me with your Yahoo's because

275
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:49,840
we got live shows coming up this weekend.

276
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:52,240
Yeah, same for regular questions, please.

277
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:53,760
Yeah, just send those to-

278
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:55,280
What do we prefer?

279
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:57,360
My bim bam at maximumfun.org?

280
00:17:57,360 --> 00:17:58,160
Yes, that's fine.

281
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:01,120
Yeah, I certainly appreciate the help.

282
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:02,640
All my Yahoo warriors.

283
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:05,360
This one was sent in by CJ Sights Brown.

284
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:08,640
It's from Yahoo Answers user Love I who asks,

285
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:14,800
The backward, misunderstandable line of Work It by Missy Elliott.

286
00:18:16,560 --> 00:18:19,520
I tried a lot to understand.

287
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:23,280
Listen carefully about the lines in this song, which Missy sings in backwards,

288
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:27,760
but I wasn't able to understand a thing and all the lyrics website has wrong lyrics.

289
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:29,360
What does she say when she sings?

290
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:30,160
Is it worth it?

291
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:30,960
Let me work it.

292
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:33,360
I put my thing down, flip it and reverse it.

293
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:35,680
Question mark, question mark, question mark, question mark, question mark.

294
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:39,040
Can I just say how fucking bold it is to be like, I don't know what it is,

295
00:18:39,040 --> 00:18:40,960
but I know that these lyric sites are wrong.

296
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:43,920
Yeah, well, yeah.

297
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:48,160
Can anyone, and then if you've got a big elephant noise,

298
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:51,520
is that the radio edit or is that in the proper dirty cut?

299
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:53,440
Is it like hog?

300
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:56,960
If you've got a big, if you've got a big ding-a-ling,

301
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:01,520
let me search it to find out how hard I gotta work you.

302
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:02,240
Question mark, question mark.

303
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:04,400
Can anyone fill out the question mark lines, please?

304
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:05,840
Wait, hold on, hold on, hold on.

305
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:07,040
Excuse me, Miss Elliott.

306
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:11,520
Are you proposing that based on the size of my wiener,

307
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:14,240
you have to work me harder or less?

308
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:19,920
I don't want to get too blue,

309
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:22,400
but Miss Elliott, that's simply not how it works.

310
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:24,720
How big is it?

311
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:27,520
Clear all, clear my schedule.

312
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:33,680
He's got a huge, he's got a, he's got a sizable Dumbo.

313
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:34,480
This is going to take all afternoon.

314
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:37,280
I actually don't know what is the inverse.

315
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:41,120
The bigger, the harder, the smaller, the, I don't know, Miss Elliott.

316
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:41,760
I do not know.

317
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:44,400
Now, off the top of your head,

318
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:46,240
do you guys actually know the answer to this?

319
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:48,800
I mean, it's something, it's whatever the song is in reverse,

320
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:49,520
but that's not fun.

321
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:53,360
I think we should give the actual, like, we should actually answer it.

322
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:55,440
Well, I think maybe we save it until after we do the jokes.

323
00:19:57,440 --> 00:19:59,520
I like to establish the walls.

324
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:01,840
Okay, and then you let us joke inside of them.

325
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:04,160
But this is Justin, it would be like a choose your own adventure

326
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:05,840
in which you said, do you want to go in the cave?

327
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:07,440
If you do, by the way, you'll die.

328
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:11,760
Um, I just want to, like, I want to say that this question,

329
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:16,160
reading it has made me realize that I, when I sing along with this song,

330
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:18,800
I definitely sing something there.

331
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:21,040
Like my mouth definitely makes sounds when I'm in the car

332
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:22,560
and I'm fucking bumping work it.

333
00:20:22,560 --> 00:20:27,040
My mouth, my lyrics are, it's your flippin nippets ran at them.

334
00:20:27,040 --> 00:20:27,440
Yeah.

335
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:28,000
That's okay.

336
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:30,240
That's about right, right?

337
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:33,680
It's yours flippy nippy flam lam yipple is what I do.

338
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:36,800
It's yours flippy nippy flam lam yipple is what I do.

339
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:37,680
And so like-

340
00:20:37,680 --> 00:20:39,840
Mine's more like I have a mouth full of peanut butter.

341
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:44,800
If I were to transcribe that, I'm a lucky individual for several reasons,

342
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:48,080
but mostly because one of my friends never like stopped the CD

343
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:52,160
and said, say that again, say that dumb shit.

344
00:20:52,160 --> 00:20:55,120
You just said, it's yours flippy nippy flam lam yipple.

345
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:57,920
What do you even think you're doing, Griffin?

346
00:20:57,920 --> 00:21:00,880
Words have meetings, actions have consequences.

347
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:05,440
This is from the same person though, and indeed the same track

348
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:11,120
that invented basically the phrase badonkadonk and just said it

349
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:14,960
and just trusted that everybody else would catch up to her level.

350
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:16,320
Like come on my level.

351
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:18,080
I'm calling it the badonkadonk now.

352
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:20,320
Why don't I call my penis my flam lam yipple?

353
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:22,000
Why didn't that catch on?

354
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:28,720
I think that that's my favorite thing about any like rap R&B music

355
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:33,280
is that context is so wonderful that oftentimes people will say stuff

356
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:35,600
that's like I've never heard.

357
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:36,400
It's like Shakespeare.

358
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:39,680
They've never heard the word before, but I definitely know what they meant.

359
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:42,000
Betwixt my flam lam yipples.

360
00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:44,880
Mine treasure.

361
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:46,720
I don't think this question has much more legs.

362
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:47,840
Just wanted to bring it up.

363
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:49,040
It's an unsolved mystery.

364
00:21:49,040 --> 00:21:52,400
That's a good one.

365
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:53,440
What do you guys want to do next?

366
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:55,200
We could talk more about-

367
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:56,560
I wanna munch squad!

368
00:21:56,560 --> 00:21:58,000
Oh, fucking all right.

369
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:01,440
I wanna munch squad!

370
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:03,440
Can we just, have we tracked-

371
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:08,480
I want to munch squad!

372
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:09,440
Munch squad!

373
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:12,160
Have we tracked the engagement on munch squad?

374
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:14,800
Cause like, listen, I'm a fan of munch squad, Justin.

375
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:17,040
The food, the jokes, it's great.

376
00:22:17,040 --> 00:22:17,680
It's hilarious.

377
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:18,640
Me and my kids, they love it.

378
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:22,240
I just want to make sure that when we introduce a new segment

379
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:24,240
and maybe this can be what I bring to munch squad

380
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:26,640
is I just want to make sure we've got the metrics

381
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:28,560
and we're tracking it and we're responsive.

382
00:22:28,560 --> 00:22:32,400
I definitely, most of this right now, just tweet about munch squad.

383
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:34,000
I haven't really gotten anybody tweet-

384
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,400
What I was kind of hoping for, people would be like,

385
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:38,080
here's a candidate for the squad.

386
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:40,160
And I'd be like, you mean the munch squad?

387
00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:41,760
It's a little early to be shortening it.

388
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:42,880
It took me a long time to call it.

389
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:44,080
Shouldn't it be munch punch?

390
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:45,440
No.

391
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:46,320
No, that's a cereal.

392
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:47,360
Get the fuck out of here.

393
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:48,160
See, that's why I'm here.

394
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:49,600
If you called it munch a bunch,

395
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:51,040
this is gonna be dead on the vine.

396
00:22:51,040 --> 00:22:52,720
Cause munch is the cereal thing.

397
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:53,360
I'm confused.

398
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:55,280
So when I'm confused by something, I hate it.

399
00:22:56,160 --> 00:22:57,440
Okay, everybody hop in the car.

400
00:22:57,440 --> 00:22:58,240
Okay.

401
00:22:58,240 --> 00:22:58,880
With me.

402
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:02,560
We're gonna drive on down route 10,

403
00:23:02,560 --> 00:23:04,240
go past the new Huntington high school.

404
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:08,320
We're gonna turn right here, past the marathon.

405
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:10,800
And if you see the Arby's, you've gone too far

406
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:12,400
cause we're pulling into Wendy's.

407
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:13,280
Oh God.

408
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:14,880
I thought we were going to Bob Evans there for a second.

409
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:15,680
I got worried.

410
00:23:15,680 --> 00:23:16,240
No, no, no.

411
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:17,760
That's over in kinetic park to the left.

412
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:19,600
We going to the world's last Ponderosa?

413
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:21,840
No, that's over on route 60, Travis.

414
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:22,000
Come on.

415
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,040
Oh, sorry.

416
00:23:23,040 --> 00:23:27,760
We're going to Wendy's for a new treat

417
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:30,720
called the limited edition bacon mozzarella burger.

418
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:33,600
Now what, as you know, on Munch Squad,

419
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:36,320
we're not really interested with the feedback on a product.

420
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:38,560
We're kind of more interested in what the experts

421
00:23:38,560 --> 00:23:39,920
who create these products have to say.

422
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:44,000
So I, here I got two,

423
00:23:47,040 --> 00:23:49,280
I got two paragraphs for the press release.

424
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,520
This just dropped May 24th.

425
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:54,240
So this is like hot off the presses, off the PR news wire.

426
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:56,320
And they cook them on the same grill

427
00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:58,240
as those delicious Wendy's burgers.

428
00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:01,520
This is literally, these two are verbatim.

429
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:05,520
Wendy's just shocked fans by dropping its previously,

430
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:06,400
I know.

431
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:07,920
What the fuck is this?

432
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:09,360
Wendy's just-

433
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:10,480
Oh no, no Wendy's.

434
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:11,920
No, not like this.

435
00:24:11,920 --> 00:24:13,680
Just shocked its fans by dropping

436
00:24:13,680 --> 00:24:16,240
its previously unannounced limited edition

437
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:17,360
bacon mozzarella burger.

438
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:19,200
You're not Beyonce.

439
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:20,880
This is not Lemonade.

440
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:22,880
Video experience on HBO.

441
00:24:24,560 --> 00:24:27,360
What is sure to be a chop topper, chart topper

442
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:28,480
on its long list of hits.

443
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:29,840
A chomp topper.

444
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:30,880
A chomp topper.

445
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:32,480
All those hits.

446
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:35,520
This is gonna fly straight up the iTunes burger charts.

447
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:37,360
I'm gonna tell you guys about the burger

448
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:39,120
and then we'll get a quote from Kurt Cain,

449
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:41,280
Wendy's chief concept and marketing officer.

450
00:24:41,280 --> 00:24:44,240
The masterpiece plays tribute to Wendy's biggest

451
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:46,640
and most classic stars like thick cut applewoods

452
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:50,320
with bacon and fresh, never frozen North American beef.

453
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:53,040
Quick side note, just for legal reasons,

454
00:24:53,920 --> 00:24:55,760
should be noted that fresh beef is available

455
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:58,640
in the contiguous U.S. and Canada.

456
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:02,080
So sorry about your luck, Hawaii and Alaska.

457
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:03,360
You're getting that old shit.

458
00:25:04,560 --> 00:25:06,480
However, Wendy's bacon-

459
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:07,600
That aged beef.

460
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:10,720
That aged beef, classic aged, always frozen.

461
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:12,400
However, Wendy's bacon mozzarella burger

462
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:14,640
puts a new spin on things by collaborating

463
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:16,080
with flavors such as creamy.

464
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:18,080
What?

465
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:18,580
What?

466
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:21,840
You know, that creamy flavor.

467
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:24,800
With creamy sweet notes of natural mozzarella cheese.

468
00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:25,840
Mozzarella.

469
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:29,200
This harmonizes a sliced red onions, spring mix

470
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:32,080
and a garlic Parmesan cheese spread all tied together.

471
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:32,880
I know what you're thinking.

472
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:34,720
Man, I really like the cheese on this burger.

473
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:36,240
Can we get a cheese spread on here too?

474
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:37,440
Indeed you can.

475
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:39,920
All tied together with toasted garlic brioche bun.

476
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:42,800
The burger redefines the genre we all thought we knew

477
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:46,080
and this hit is only available for a limited time.

478
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:49,360
So in the two things, first thing

479
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:52,000
is that in the like marketing of this product

480
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,160
there's some key art here

481
00:25:56,080 --> 00:25:59,840
that is supposed to advertise this product.

482
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:02,080
And for some reason, continuing with this

483
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:05,920
frankly insane theme that they've created

484
00:26:05,920 --> 00:26:08,400
they have made the key art for this product

485
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:11,840
look like a CD case.

486
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:15,440
This CD case actually has-

487
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:18,400
Okay, so then this has to be,

488
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:20,400
like the language that they've used

489
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:23,360
has to be like a Beyonce lemonade goof, right?

490
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:24,240
Oh God, yes.

491
00:26:25,040 --> 00:26:28,560
So Travis, I've sent you a link to this product.

492
00:26:28,560 --> 00:26:30,400
If you could just dip right in there

493
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:32,080
and give me some of the track list.

494
00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:35,760
I fucking absolutely can't.

495
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:36,640
I disassociate-

496
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:40,080
Do not Justin, please let us not jump ahead

497
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:42,880
from the taste bud advisory

498
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:46,640
delicious ingredients indicator on the CD

499
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:48,080
just to let you know just in case.

500
00:26:49,920 --> 00:26:51,440
Track number one.

501
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:53,120
Track number one is what, Travis?

502
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:54,240
Good buns, hon.

503
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:58,160
Parentheses, intro, parentheses.

504
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:01,280
Performed by garlic brioche bun

505
00:27:01,280 --> 00:27:03,040
and written by That's Soft Taste.

506
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:10,160
Hit it, hit it, hit it, garlic brioche bun.

507
00:27:10,160 --> 00:27:12,080
Is this that new That's Soft Taste track?

508
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:13,680
Is this Sia?

509
00:27:13,680 --> 00:27:16,400
No, it's That's Soft Taste.

510
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:18,480
Track number two, Travis, what is it?

511
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:19,520
Spread it on.

512
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:22,400
Performed by garlic parmesan cheese spread

513
00:27:23,040 --> 00:27:24,880
written by The Condiments.

514
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:26,080
Now I would like to point out

515
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:28,560
it's just occurred to me that this is like

516
00:27:28,560 --> 00:27:30,320
and now that's what I call music

517
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:32,400
a burger compilation CD

518
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:35,280
because these are all different artists and writers.

519
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:37,760
The third is Tears of Joy

520
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:40,880
performed by Red Onion written by Mother Nature.

521
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:46,000
Show me fucking like a painting of Mother Gaia

522
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:48,400
floating over a Wendy's like,

523
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:50,800
oh yes, y'all heard my mixtape?

524
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:51,840
It is fire.

525
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:53,440
Travis, what's that fourth track?

526
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:55,200
So Fresh and So Green.

527
00:27:56,800 --> 00:28:00,160
Somebody spent a long time designing this CD thing.

528
00:28:00,160 --> 00:28:03,520
I, Garen, fucking tee you.

529
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:06,560
We are the only people to ever do a deep dive

530
00:28:06,560 --> 00:28:08,000
into the track list of this burger.

531
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:09,120
Yeah, whoever wrote this is like,

532
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:10,560
nobody's fucking reading this shit.

533
00:28:10,560 --> 00:28:12,080
I just want to get out of here, it's Friday.

534
00:28:13,680 --> 00:28:15,840
A Gooey performed by mozzarella cheese

535
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:16,960
and written by All Natural.

536
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:20,080
Oh, Justin, you skipped That Oven Lovin,

537
00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:22,960
a terrifying, terrifying term.

538
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:25,520
Now, is that the one performed by Applewood Smoked Bacon?

539
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:26,560
I love their shit.

540
00:28:26,560 --> 00:28:28,000
Written by The Thick Cuts?

541
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:28,480
It is.

542
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:29,440
Yeah, The Thick Cuts.

543
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:33,440
Track number seven is We Can't Freeze, We Won't Freeze.

544
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:34,960
Performed by North American Beef.

545
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:37,120
Written by 100% Fresh Never Frozen.

546
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:40,480
And then there is, just in this fucking-

547
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:43,680
Hell, they're on some outcast shit.

548
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:45,520
They definitely do have the asterisk there

549
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:49,680
to reiterate that 100% Fresh Never Frozen Beef

550
00:28:49,680 --> 00:28:53,040
is only available in the contiguous U.S. and Canada.

551
00:28:53,040 --> 00:28:56,000
Just super want to make it super duper clear.

552
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,000
Even on this dumb ass track list,

553
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,480
they definitely, Alaska and Hawaii are still fucked.

554
00:29:01,680 --> 00:29:04,080
And then, yeah, so what you don't see on here

555
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:06,960
is there's the three BurgerTime,

556
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:08,960
just the skits that they do in there,

557
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:10,080
just like break things up,

558
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:11,440
add a little bit of narrative to this evening.

559
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:12,240
Yeah, some fun.

560
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:14,400
They got Chris Tucker to come out

561
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:16,080
and just like do some skits with them.

562
00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:20,080
And there's a Good Buns outro,

563
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:22,720
but it was also written by That Soft Taste,

564
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:24,480
kind of aping his own shit.

565
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:26,960
Here's the quote from Kurt Kane,

566
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:30,480
the bacon mozzarella is a cheeseburger lover's dream.

567
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:33,360
From the first bite, this combination of fresh beef

568
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:35,920
and oven-cooked bacon paired with melty mozzarella

569
00:29:35,920 --> 00:29:38,320
and garlic Parmesan cheese spread

570
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:40,480
creates a deliciously unforgettable burger.

571
00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:44,080
Kurt's work here is a little underwhelming.

572
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:46,720
I'd like him to get with the whole pastiche.

573
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:48,160
Hey, Kurt, can I talk to you real quick?

574
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:49,040
Do you have a second?

575
00:29:49,040 --> 00:29:50,080
Yeah, what is it, Dave?

576
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:53,280
I read your quote.

577
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:54,080
It's lovely.

578
00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:54,880
It's great.

579
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:57,760
It's great, we're kind of doing a whole like,

580
00:29:57,760 --> 00:30:00,320
we're dropping the, it's like a Beyonce thing,

581
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:02,000
like with the album and the thing.

582
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,720
Could you fucking get on board for one second, Kurt?

583
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:06,720
Kurt's original quote was like,

584
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:09,760
I didn't want to do any of this.

585
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:14,720
It's a fucking burger with cheese and bacon on it.

586
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:16,560
Is your mind blown, America?

587
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:18,400
You've got what now?

588
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:22,320
Reinventing the genre.

589
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:24,800
They are, in fact, they say it.

590
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:26,880
They say they're doing that.

591
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:28,800
They're doing that, they say it.

592
00:30:28,800 --> 00:30:30,560
Hi, this is McDonald talking to help you.

593
00:30:30,560 --> 00:30:32,320
Hi, I just wanted to tell you,

594
00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:34,400
I need you to take all the burgers

595
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:35,840
that you've already made in there

596
00:30:35,840 --> 00:30:37,840
and put them in the fucking garbage can

597
00:30:38,560 --> 00:30:40,640
because Wendy's just blew up the fucking game.

598
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:42,560
You never even thought about putting bacon

599
00:30:42,560 --> 00:30:43,680
and cheese on your burger.

600
00:30:43,680 --> 00:30:44,800
But we do this, goodbye.

601
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:49,200
Hey, it's Ronald, it's Ron, shut it all down.

602
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:51,840
Shut it all down, we're fucking idiots.

603
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:54,400
Throw it out with the bubble jug, set it on fire.

604
00:30:54,400 --> 00:30:56,960
We're done with all the dumb ass burgers we were making.

605
00:30:56,960 --> 00:30:57,840
What were we thinking?

606
00:30:57,840 --> 00:30:58,880
I'm so embarrassed.

607
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:00,640
Someone made this.

608
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:04,480
It does look good though.

609
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:06,800
I mean, it looks like an all right burger.

610
00:31:06,800 --> 00:31:10,720
I think maybe for, this was very good PR, obviously.

611
00:31:11,280 --> 00:31:13,200
Sure, it got us talking.

612
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:15,760
I feel like the first episode of Munch Squad

613
00:31:15,760 --> 00:31:18,320
really got me into the idea of foods

614
00:31:18,320 --> 00:31:21,280
that would definitely kill a dog or a child

615
00:31:21,280 --> 00:31:22,480
if they got their hands on it.

616
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:24,880
And I don't think this burger would do the job

617
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:27,120
as much as a fried chicken taco would.

618
00:31:29,040 --> 00:31:31,200
Although I don't know, there is a lot of mozzarella on here.

619
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:34,320
There's a lot of mozzarella in the sauce on there too.

620
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:35,600
It's like a lot of levels.

621
00:31:36,160 --> 00:31:37,600
Is that how it is groundbreaking?

622
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:40,880
When you're coming up with a mozzarella based recipe,

623
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:43,040
is there a number that represents

624
00:31:43,040 --> 00:31:44,720
how much fresh mootz goes on it?

625
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:48,800
And then that number, the scale is like one to six.

626
00:31:48,800 --> 00:31:50,480
And then Wendy's like, we need a new burger.

627
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:52,320
And it's like, well, what if we just took the mootz scale

628
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:53,680
and just like threw it the fuck away

629
00:31:53,680 --> 00:31:55,680
and we did like 15 or 16?

630
00:31:55,680 --> 00:31:57,120
They're like, that would change the game.

631
00:31:57,120 --> 00:31:59,280
Cause I am looking on this and it is a gooey baby.

632
00:31:59,840 --> 00:32:00,960
That's the ninth track.

633
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:03,280
I went to Wendy's Facebook page

634
00:32:03,280 --> 00:32:05,040
to see if I could find some more information

635
00:32:05,040 --> 00:32:06,640
about this fucking jam.

636
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:08,720
And it's literally all yoga videos.

637
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:10,080
I don't really know what they're doing.

638
00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:14,000
It's just pictures that their fans have posted

639
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,240
and it's just their skeletal bodies

640
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:17,360
after they ate one of these

641
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:19,520
and were probably just completely destroyed

642
00:32:19,520 --> 00:32:21,120
by how mind blowing.

643
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:23,280
Oh my God, they've done it.

644
00:32:25,520 --> 00:32:27,600
I'm gonna call Wendy's right now and congratulate them.

645
00:32:28,400 --> 00:32:40,400
Okay, so let's hear what he said.

646
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:42,560
You know what pairs really well

647
00:32:42,560 --> 00:32:44,560
with a Wendy's mozzarella burger?

648
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:48,160
No, Trav, I'm not quite sure.

649
00:32:48,160 --> 00:32:50,400
Neither do I, Justin, cause it's groundbreaking.

650
00:32:50,400 --> 00:32:51,360
I've never had it.

651
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:53,040
But you know who does?

652
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:53,920
What?

653
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:56,880
What goes well with 13 pounds of mozzarella?

654
00:32:57,840 --> 00:32:59,440
I'll tell you who does know.

655
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:00,080
Club W.

656
00:33:01,280 --> 00:33:02,560
They pair shit with shit.

657
00:33:02,560 --> 00:33:03,920
All the, mostly wine.

658
00:33:03,920 --> 00:33:05,520
I don't think they're pairing other stuff.

659
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:06,800
But maybe they do.

660
00:33:06,800 --> 00:33:08,720
Maybe in their free time on the off hours

661
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:10,640
they're just pairing stuff with stuff.

662
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:12,320
They're like, you know what hand towels

663
00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:14,000
go with what combat boots?

664
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:15,200
Club W knows.

665
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:17,280
They're just nose arcing their way

666
00:33:17,280 --> 00:33:18,640
through all of existence.

667
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:20,240
They're just, they ship every character

668
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:21,680
they see on every television show.

669
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:24,800
And they ship every, they're like,

670
00:33:25,360 --> 00:33:27,680
I don't know, like Converse All Stars

671
00:33:27,680 --> 00:33:30,640
pair great with a compound bow.

672
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:33,040
I don't know if they do it, not me.

673
00:33:33,040 --> 00:33:34,160
And how do they do that?

674
00:33:34,160 --> 00:33:36,240
Well, you would think like a wine club,

675
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:37,520
a wine shipment thing.

676
00:33:37,520 --> 00:33:39,440
They must ask me like, do you like Rose?

677
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:40,400
Do you like Chardonnay?

678
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:41,840
What kind of kind of wine?

679
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:43,360
No, what they do is it's genius.

680
00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:45,200
They have a very simple questionnaire.

681
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:47,440
Stuff like, do you prefer chocolate or vanilla?

682
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:48,160
That kind of thing.

683
00:33:48,160 --> 00:33:48,960
Do you like salty?

684
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:50,320
Do you like sweet?

685
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:52,080
And through that, they're able to determine

686
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:54,800
your preferences and make recommendations for wine.

687
00:33:54,800 --> 00:33:56,560
Then that wine is shipped to you.

688
00:33:56,560 --> 00:33:59,120
And this is like fancy looking,

689
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:01,200
incredibly like classy shit

690
00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:03,840
that makes you look like you know what you're doing.

691
00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:06,080
Even though, let's be honest, you do not.

692
00:34:06,800 --> 00:34:08,640
And they come with cards that like tell you

693
00:34:08,640 --> 00:34:10,640
all about the wine, what it pairs with,

694
00:34:10,640 --> 00:34:12,240
when it's a good time to drink it.

695
00:34:12,240 --> 00:34:13,600
So you can memorize all that.

696
00:34:13,600 --> 00:34:14,800
And then when your friends come over,

697
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:16,560
you're like, hey, do you like that wine?

698
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:19,120
I know it's really great with this chicken mark pizza.

699
00:34:19,120 --> 00:34:19,680
I know.

700
00:34:20,640 --> 00:34:22,080
And then you can act like you knew it

701
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:23,040
off the top of your head.

702
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:27,200
And it's relatively affordable.

703
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:29,120
Justin, please tell them how affordable

704
00:34:29,120 --> 00:34:30,160
and wonderful it is.

705
00:34:30,160 --> 00:34:32,560
Or right now, Club W is offering our listeners

706
00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:34,240

707

And Club W will actually pay for shipping.

711
00:34:46,720 --> 00:34:48,800
They're shipping beloved characters.

712
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:52,240
They're also shipping wine, and they'll pay for it

713
00:34:52,240 --> 00:34:54,960
on orders of four bottles or more.

714
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:59,520
That address, again, is clubw.com slash my brother.

715
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:03,120
Just real quick, I went down a Google hole

716
00:35:03,120 --> 00:35:04,080
because I brought up shipping.

717
00:35:04,080 --> 00:35:05,120
And I just couldn't, I like it.

718
00:35:05,120 --> 00:35:06,880
For some reason, I had this flash thought in my head

719
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:10,560
of is there like a Tumblr community of people

720
00:35:10,560 --> 00:35:12,240
who ship Frasier characters?

721
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:15,840
And the answer is there isn't, there's not.

722
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:17,840
I don't believe you, Griffin.

723
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:20,240
You don't believe me that there isn't?

724
00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:21,680
I mean, there is one now, because I just like,

725
00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:23,680
I feel like I just breathed it into existence.

726
00:35:23,680 --> 00:35:25,680
But just like, I searched, I actually searched

727
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:27,920
Frasier shipping Niles slash G.

728
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:30,000
I would do Niles and Ross.

729
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,720
Like, I just feel like there was something there.

730
00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:33,120
You know?

731
00:35:33,120 --> 00:35:34,240
Who's Ross?

732
00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:36,080
Do you mean Ross, idiot?

733
00:35:36,080 --> 00:35:37,760
No, Ross, you fucking idiot.

734
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:39,920
No, I mean Ross from friends.

735
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:42,880
I just felt like there was something.

736
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:44,880
Do you remember the famous Frasier friends

737
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:45,840
crossover episode?

738
00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:53,280
Nationwide obsession was whether or not Ross from friends

739
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:54,640
and Frasier were gonna fuck.

740
00:35:55,280 --> 00:35:56,720
And the producers of the shows were like,

741
00:35:56,720 --> 00:35:57,840
this is never happening.

742
00:35:57,840 --> 00:35:59,440
Why are you people so obsessed with this?

743
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:02,560
I'm not even sure they're on the same network.

744
00:36:04,080 --> 00:36:07,840
The episode was 15 seconds long, a wormhole opened up

745
00:36:07,840 --> 00:36:10,480
and sucked them both into a single room.

746
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:12,880
And then Ross walked up to Frasier and he just went,

747
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:14,560
I don't want to fuck you.

748
00:36:14,560 --> 00:36:16,560
And then bow, bow, bow, bow, bow, bow.

749
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:17,840
And put in side belt theme.

750
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:27,760
I don't want to fuck you either.

751
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:34,480
I want to tell you about some underwear

752
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:35,200
I'm wearing right now.

753
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:42,000
They are me undies and you just can't stop thinking about.

754
00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:46,160
Hi, is this people magazine?

755
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:47,520
Yes, it is.

756
00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:50,240
Hi, this is David Crane, creator of friends.

757
00:36:50,240 --> 00:36:53,840
Could you do me a favor and please stop putting pictures

758
00:36:53,840 --> 00:36:58,080
of Ross from our show and Frasier on the cover of your magazine

759
00:36:58,080 --> 00:37:00,640
with a big question mark and pictures of kisses

760
00:37:00,640 --> 00:37:02,080
because it's not happening.

761
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:03,280
I'm really, I'm over it.

762
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:04,400
We're all really over it.

763
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:05,440
It's not happening.

764
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:06,800
I don't know how this got started.

765
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:07,680
It's never happening.

766
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:10,960
Hi, it's me, David Angel.

767
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:13,680
Could you keep putting creator of Frasier,

768
00:37:13,680 --> 00:37:16,160
could you keep putting those pictures on?

769
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:18,800
Is doing gangbusters for our ratings.

770
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:20,080
Thank you so much.

771
00:37:20,080 --> 00:37:22,080
That's explains everybody's watching Frasier

772
00:37:22,080 --> 00:37:25,440
because they kept watching for Ross to show up and fuck him.

773
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:28,480
Everyone's favorite friend, Ross, is he going to be on here?

774
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:31,920
It's the new will they, won't they, can they?

775
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:34,560
Because of the dimensions.

776
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:36,560
Well, because they're two men, Justin.

777
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:39,280
You're unfucking believable.

778
00:37:40,160 --> 00:37:40,960
I have a sponsor here.

779
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:42,080
It's me undies.

780
00:37:42,080 --> 00:37:44,000
And it's underwear I'm literally wearing right now

781
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:44,960
because they're the most comfortable,

782
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:46,640
most wonderful underwear in the universe.

783
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:49,440
They are soft.

784
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:50,720
They breathe real nice.

785
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:51,840
I was on a plane today.

786
00:37:51,840 --> 00:37:53,520
I try to wear them on a plane whenever I can

787
00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:55,920
because they just like, they don't bunch up and get all yucky.

788
00:37:56,960 --> 00:37:59,520
It's made from a sustainably sourced modal fabric

789
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:01,040
that's twice as soft as cotton.

790
00:38:01,040 --> 00:38:02,880
Just nothing can describe how good they feel.

791
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:05,280

792
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:06,640

They're really, really great.

I guarantee you, you will not regret

808
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:37,120
getting these underwear and putting them on your body.

809
00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:39,360
I have got a jumbo charm message

810
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:42,000
and it's for Mike and Allie or Mallie,

811
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:43,440
as I like to call them.

812
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:44,880
And it's from Chris.

813
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:47,600
And Chris says, to my dearest friends,

814
00:38:47,600 --> 00:38:50,320
you have been my closest friends for over 10 years now.

815
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:52,800
And I want to congratulate you on your nuptials

816
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:55,600
with the help of the dulcet tones of the McElroy brothers.

817
00:38:55,600 --> 00:38:59,840
From our times in Peterborough at PR 13,

818
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:01,680
was that like their training camp?

819
00:39:01,680 --> 00:39:04,160
To Toronto and everywhere else,

820
00:39:04,160 --> 00:39:05,680
thank you for being a friend

821
00:39:05,680 --> 00:39:07,680
and for letting me be a part of your lives

822
00:39:07,680 --> 00:39:08,480
and your wedding.

823
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:12,080
That sounds nice.

824
00:39:12,080 --> 00:39:13,760
What is PR 13, you guys?

825
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:17,120
It's definitely some sort of secret underground laboratory.

826
00:39:17,120 --> 00:39:18,800
Maybe a public school, probably?

827
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:20,880
No, no, it's definitely-

828
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:22,160
Then it would be called like

829
00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:25,760
the Alexander Hamilton School for the Gifted.

830
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:27,840
Okay, that's true, probably true.

831
00:39:27,840 --> 00:39:30,960
I think they were developing the Andromeda strain.

832
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:34,560
And fucking, you ever look up in the sky

833
00:39:34,560 --> 00:39:37,920
and you see those white like straight lines up there?

834
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:39,440
Those are called chemtrails, you guys.

835
00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:40,400
And they're no joke.

836
00:39:42,240 --> 00:39:43,760
They're serious business.

837
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:44,480
What do they do?

838
00:39:45,680 --> 00:39:47,120
Exactly, what do they do?

839
00:39:48,080 --> 00:39:50,800
I think Chris, Mike, and Allie owe us an explanation.

840
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:52,320
What are you hiding?

841
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:55,200
What are you hiding, Chris, Mike, and Allie?

842
00:39:55,200 --> 00:39:57,280
And what aren't you hiding?

843
00:39:57,280 --> 00:40:00,000
I've got a message here for Cade and it's from Grace.

844
00:40:01,120 --> 00:40:02,480
And Grace says to Cade,

845
00:40:02,480 --> 00:40:05,120
happy birthday, wishing you a steady flow of creative energy

846
00:40:05,120 --> 00:40:06,240
and drive this year.

847
00:40:06,240 --> 00:40:08,320
Thank you for being a wonderful partner and housemate

848
00:40:08,320 --> 00:40:10,720
and for introducing me to the McElroy family of products.

849
00:40:10,720 --> 00:40:12,240
I love you and so does the cat,

850
00:40:12,240 --> 00:40:14,400
to whatever extent a cat can feel love.

851
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:15,360
So not very much.

852
00:40:16,160 --> 00:40:16,880
I like that.

853
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:20,000
I like that they said that like as much as the cat can,

854
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:23,200
it is, like we're not gonna say that the cat's not feeling love.

855
00:40:23,200 --> 00:40:27,280
We just don't know what level of love the cat might be feeling.

856
00:40:27,840 --> 00:40:30,560
They need a flow of creative energy and drive.

857
00:40:30,560 --> 00:40:35,600
We're gonna give them that blockbuster million dollar idea right now.

858
00:40:35,600 --> 00:40:37,520
Griffin, say any word, go.

859
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:39,280
Jungle?

860
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:40,800
Now Justin, say a word.

861
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:41,840
Please say two.

862
00:40:41,840 --> 00:40:44,000
No, okay, Jungle Bungle's very good, damn it.

863
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:46,640
Okay, Jungle Bungle pants, go.

864
00:40:46,640 --> 00:40:48,240
Oh no, you shouldn't have added the pants to it.

865
00:40:48,240 --> 00:40:49,680
Jungle Bungle was perfect, Travis.

866
00:40:49,680 --> 00:40:50,560
Jungle Bungle's great.

867
00:40:51,360 --> 00:40:53,120
But then we don't each get to say a word.

868
00:40:53,120 --> 00:40:55,040
You can't take my ability to say a word.

869
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:57,760
Travis, listen, just put an exclamation point there.

870
00:40:57,760 --> 00:40:59,520
Okay, yeah, Jungle Bungle 2.

871
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:03,680
The sequel to Jungle to Jungle,

872
00:41:03,680 --> 00:41:06,160
which I know it's fucking confusing, guys, Hollywood.

873
00:41:06,160 --> 00:41:07,520
Because the two was already in there.

874
00:41:07,520 --> 00:41:09,040
What the fuck, Jungle to Jungle?

875
00:41:10,160 --> 00:41:12,320
Jungle Bungle exclamation point three.

876
00:41:12,320 --> 00:41:15,200
The second Jungle to Jungle movie starring Tim Allen again.

877
00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:20,720
Oh, I got a message for you, the listener.

878
00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:23,440
And it's about the Useless Majors,

879
00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:25,760
which is a scripted narrative podcast

880
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:27,680
following a group of recent college graduates

881
00:41:27,680 --> 00:41:31,280
who, after an accident involving radioactive diplomas,

882
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:33,440
receive superpowers based on their majors.

883
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:35,200
That's a fucking good idea for a thing.

884
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:36,640
It's a great fucking premise.

885
00:41:36,640 --> 00:41:39,760
I'll just, Kate, take that, do that one.

886
00:41:39,760 --> 00:41:42,000
As evil forces conspire to take over the world,

887
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:44,000
our heroes have found themselves working at the mall

888
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:46,720
with the help of robots, which is ghosts of US presidents

889
00:41:46,720 --> 00:41:48,480
and other crazy characters.

890
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:49,920
Can our heroes save the day?

891
00:41:50,480 --> 00:41:52,400
That's good, that puts suspense right in there.

892
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:54,800
And you could subscribe to the Useless Majors podcast

893
00:41:54,800 --> 00:41:59,440
on iTunes, or you can go to uselessmajors.com

894
00:42:00,080 --> 00:42:02,400
and you can subscribe there.

895
00:42:03,680 --> 00:42:07,760
And it looks like they're on their ninth episode over there,

896
00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:13,840
so it's not too late to catch up and go do it.

897
00:42:13,840 --> 00:42:16,080
Go for it, check it out, the Useless Majors.

898
00:42:16,080 --> 00:42:20,720
What would my superpower be, journalism-ing?

899
00:42:20,720 --> 00:42:22,880
You'd be able to find the truth in all things.

900
00:42:23,600 --> 00:42:25,200
Oh, fuck, that would be good.

901
00:42:25,200 --> 00:42:26,000
Yeah.

902
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:30,960
But also I would wear shorts but suit tops

903
00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:32,400
and I would be kind of a jag.

904
00:42:34,080 --> 00:42:38,560
I have a drama degrees, or an acting and directing degree,

905
00:42:38,560 --> 00:42:42,080
so my superpower would be to live in my parents' house

906
00:42:42,080 --> 00:42:44,240
for a few months, just so I can figure some things out.

907
00:42:44,240 --> 00:42:44,740
Yep.

908
00:42:46,320 --> 00:42:48,400
You'd be like Rogue, because you'd get

909
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:50,400
a different superpower eventually.

910
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:56,160
Your superpower as an acting major would be,

911
00:42:56,160 --> 00:42:58,240
you eventually would change to a different superpower.

912
00:42:58,240 --> 00:43:00,080
Is the superpower to have another superpower

913
00:43:00,080 --> 00:43:02,720
but keep telling people about the superpower you used to do?

914
00:43:04,480 --> 00:43:05,760
For free now?

915
00:43:06,320 --> 00:43:07,840
You're like Phoenix, you're like Jean Grey,

916
00:43:07,840 --> 00:43:09,360
you transform at some point.

917
00:43:09,360 --> 00:43:13,680
I summon ice crystals from thin air now,

918
00:43:13,680 --> 00:43:17,040
kind of just for me, at a more personal level.

919
00:43:17,760 --> 00:43:19,040
In the community?

920
00:43:19,040 --> 00:43:21,280
I got out in the community, I kind of got out

921
00:43:21,280 --> 00:43:23,760
of the rat race with that power.

922
00:43:24,960 --> 00:43:27,040
By which I mean fighting the race of rat men

923
00:43:27,040 --> 00:43:30,240
that I used to battle, but I wasn't making any money off of it.

924
00:43:30,240 --> 00:43:31,280
You know, you know that whole thing.

925
00:43:31,280 --> 00:43:32,480
You know, you know how it goes.

926
00:43:32,480 --> 00:43:35,440
I recently achieved a pretty major adult milestone,

927
00:43:35,440 --> 00:43:37,360
moving into my first apartment.

928
00:43:37,360 --> 00:43:39,600
I'm lucky enough to have a job that allows me to live alone,

929
00:43:39,600 --> 00:43:41,200
and that has been, quite possibly,

930
00:43:41,200 --> 00:43:43,200
the greatest thing that has ever happened to me.

931
00:43:43,200 --> 00:43:46,000
The only problem is my mother, who lives in the same city

932
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:47,440
and wants me to give her a key.

933
00:43:47,440 --> 00:43:50,000
Ooh, I have no real reason to say no.

934
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:52,640
The landlord said I could make as many copies as I want,

935
00:43:52,640 --> 00:43:54,720
and I don't have a roommate whose privacy I must preserve,

936
00:43:54,720 --> 00:43:56,160
but I really want to say no.

937
00:43:56,720 --> 00:43:58,560
I feel like in giving my mother a key,

938
00:43:58,560 --> 00:44:00,800
I'll be losing some of my newfound independence.

939
00:44:00,800 --> 00:44:02,640
Does this make me a terrible daughter?

940
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:04,560
Should I give her a key and suck it up?

941
00:44:04,560 --> 00:44:06,560
Or if I say no, how do I say no?

942
00:44:06,560 --> 00:44:08,160
Help from Caitlin, huh?

943
00:44:09,040 --> 00:44:12,320
The implication, I think, if you give your mom a key,

944
00:44:12,320 --> 00:44:14,000
I mean, the implication of that is like,

945
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:18,240
I at any point want you there when I am not, right?

946
00:44:18,240 --> 00:44:18,800
I mean, that's-

947
00:44:18,800 --> 00:44:19,040
Yeah.

948
00:44:19,920 --> 00:44:21,120
Not necessarily, no.

949
00:44:21,120 --> 00:44:23,200
Well, not to rush it, but I feel like Caitlin,

950
00:44:23,200 --> 00:44:26,240
like, you need to achieve a second adult milestone,

951
00:44:26,240 --> 00:44:28,800
and that is to be direct with a parent.

952
00:44:28,800 --> 00:44:29,040
Yeah.

953
00:44:29,040 --> 00:44:30,400
And like, if you give her a key,

954
00:44:30,400 --> 00:44:32,160
you have to say like, I'm giving you this,

955
00:44:32,160 --> 00:44:34,640
but this is for emergencies only.

956
00:44:34,640 --> 00:44:36,960
It's not like you're gonna fucking get home from work

957
00:44:36,960 --> 00:44:38,960
and go to open up a cold soda and be like,

958
00:44:38,960 --> 00:44:40,800
oh no, my mom came over and drank it all.

959
00:44:40,800 --> 00:44:42,400
Like, I don't think that's what's gonna,

960
00:44:43,120 --> 00:44:45,360
she'll probably call, you know?

961
00:44:46,640 --> 00:44:47,440
I don't know, Griffin,

962
00:44:47,440 --> 00:44:49,120
because I would feel like if that was the case,

963
00:44:49,120 --> 00:44:50,720
Caitlin wouldn't be worried about it.

964
00:44:51,840 --> 00:44:54,160
The very fact that Caitlin felt the need to like,

965
00:44:54,160 --> 00:44:56,160
write in and ask us about it,

966
00:44:56,160 --> 00:44:58,800
implies to me that there's at least some doubt in her mind

967
00:44:58,800 --> 00:45:01,120
that her mom will not understand the boundaries

968
00:45:01,120 --> 00:45:03,520
and will see it as like an extension of the house

969
00:45:03,520 --> 00:45:04,720
that they lived in together.

970
00:45:05,440 --> 00:45:06,720
The fact that you, yeah,

971
00:45:06,720 --> 00:45:09,120
I guess the fact that you like have to think about this,

972
00:45:09,120 --> 00:45:14,800
like you gotta, a door is a good boundary,

973
00:45:14,800 --> 00:45:16,480
a locked door has a good boundary,

974
00:45:16,480 --> 00:45:18,560
but there's better ones you can establish

975
00:45:19,200 --> 00:45:27,600
sort of in the immaterial space in your relationship.

976
00:45:28,320 --> 00:45:31,040
And those are also very important boundaries,

977
00:45:31,040 --> 00:45:34,560
but don't lock those up, I've been Dr. Phil.

978
00:45:34,560 --> 00:45:37,680
I think that's why saying something on lines of like,

979
00:45:37,680 --> 00:45:39,680
this is for emergencies only,

980
00:45:39,680 --> 00:45:42,240
and then if she abuses that, you can say,

981
00:45:42,240 --> 00:45:45,680
I told you that that's an invasion of my privacy, mob,

982
00:45:45,680 --> 00:45:47,840
like I told you that this was for emergencies only,

983
00:45:47,840 --> 00:45:49,040
please don't abuse it.

984
00:45:49,680 --> 00:45:52,080
But if you aren't direct up front,

985
00:45:52,080 --> 00:45:55,040
you don't have any case later, you know what I mean?

986
00:45:55,040 --> 00:45:57,200
You have to say like, I'm giving you this,

987
00:45:57,200 --> 00:45:59,440
but like, it's for emergencies only, okay?

988
00:45:59,440 --> 00:46:02,000
This is silly though, this is silly though.

989
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:06,480
Cause like, if you're worried about your mom

990
00:46:06,480 --> 00:46:09,680
like just dropping in, she doesn't really need a key,

991
00:46:10,800 --> 00:46:13,280
cause your mom is an international jewel thief

992
00:46:13,280 --> 00:46:14,400
and cat burglar.

993
00:46:14,400 --> 00:46:16,480
No, she'll just like come over,

994
00:46:16,480 --> 00:46:18,320
it's like knock on the door and he'd be like,

995
00:46:18,320 --> 00:46:19,920
no, I don't want you to come in.

996
00:46:20,480 --> 00:46:20,880
Like that's not how-

997
00:46:20,880 --> 00:46:22,000
That's an excellent point.

998
00:46:22,560 --> 00:46:24,720
Yeah, the key is not the thing.

999
00:46:24,720 --> 00:46:26,720
If your fear is in doing it,

1000
00:46:26,720 --> 00:46:30,240
just like you giving her a key is somehow giving up.

1001
00:46:30,240 --> 00:46:31,520
So let me tell you someone who's lived

1002
00:46:31,520 --> 00:46:32,880
in a lot of apartments,

1003
00:46:32,880 --> 00:46:35,600
I'm always glad when someone has an extra key.

1004
00:46:35,600 --> 00:46:37,440
When I lose my key or lock myself out

1005
00:46:37,440 --> 00:46:39,760
or I need someone to like go take care of something

1006
00:46:39,760 --> 00:46:40,960
when I'm like out of town.

1007
00:46:42,640 --> 00:46:45,760
My mother-in-law didn't have a key to our house for a while

1008
00:46:45,760 --> 00:46:48,560
and then when we needed her to feed our cats,

1009
00:46:48,560 --> 00:46:50,400
cause we got a flight canceled or something,

1010
00:46:50,400 --> 00:46:52,480
she ended up having to shove turkey slices

1011
00:46:52,480 --> 00:46:53,760
through the mail slot,

1012
00:46:53,760 --> 00:46:55,360
which is not great for cats.

1013
00:46:55,360 --> 00:46:57,360
She never stopped.

1014
00:46:57,360 --> 00:46:59,360
She's still doing it to this day.

1015
00:46:59,360 --> 00:47:03,600
You've ruined the idea of the mailman to your cat.

1016
00:47:03,600 --> 00:47:05,360
Every time your cat hears the mail come in,

1017
00:47:05,360 --> 00:47:08,080
it's like, oh boy, another turkey delivery for me.

1018
00:47:08,080 --> 00:47:08,800
Oh hell yeah.

1019
00:47:10,800 --> 00:47:12,480
I have a fucking good answer to this, you guys.

1020
00:47:12,480 --> 00:47:13,120
You ready?

1021
00:47:13,120 --> 00:47:13,760
Yes.

1022
00:47:13,760 --> 00:47:14,480
You're gonna love this.

1023
00:47:15,360 --> 00:47:15,920
Fake key.

1024
00:47:17,200 --> 00:47:20,480
Jesus, give her a key that doesn't work in the lock

1025
00:47:20,480 --> 00:47:24,880
and then if she tries to break into your house

1026
00:47:24,880 --> 00:47:26,240
when you don't want her there,

1027
00:47:26,240 --> 00:47:27,440
she'll have to say to you,

1028
00:47:27,440 --> 00:47:28,480
hey, that key didn't work

1029
00:47:28,480 --> 00:47:29,840
cause I was trying to break into your house.

1030
00:47:29,840 --> 00:47:30,800
You'll never hear about it.

1031
00:47:31,760 --> 00:47:33,440
If she tries to get in at a time

1032
00:47:33,440 --> 00:47:35,280
when like you really wish she could get in,

1033
00:47:35,280 --> 00:47:37,840
you can just say like, Dunk, I'm sorry.

1034
00:47:37,840 --> 00:47:38,640
I guess it was like-

1035
00:47:39,440 --> 00:47:41,920
I didn't test it before I gave it to you.

1036
00:47:41,920 --> 00:47:43,440
Yeah, I should have tested it before I gave it to you.

1037
00:47:43,440 --> 00:47:44,320
I'll know for next time.

1038
00:47:44,320 --> 00:47:46,400
Looks like Home Depot really wanged it on this one.

1039
00:47:46,400 --> 00:47:48,400
Oh well, too bad my cat is dead.

1040
00:47:49,200 --> 00:47:52,400
This was a bad prank on myself and my cat.

1041
00:47:53,440 --> 00:47:54,240
Sorry, cat.

1042
00:47:54,240 --> 00:47:55,120
Do you guys wanna Yahoo?

1043
00:47:55,680 --> 00:47:56,320
Sure.

1044
00:47:56,320 --> 00:47:57,040
We crushed that one.

1045
00:47:57,760 --> 00:47:58,720
We deserve a little treat.

1046
00:48:02,160 --> 00:48:02,880
This one's for us.

1047
00:48:04,320 --> 00:48:06,400
You gotta do one for them and one for you.

1048
00:48:06,400 --> 00:48:07,920
That's the Hollywood way.

1049
00:48:07,920 --> 00:48:09,120
Rachel Rosings sent this one,

1050
00:48:09,120 --> 00:48:10,720
a game recognized game, thank you, Rachel.

1051
00:48:10,720 --> 00:48:11,520
It's an obvious troll

1052
00:48:11,520 --> 00:48:13,120
so I wanna just blow through it and get to a good one

1053
00:48:13,120 --> 00:48:15,120
but it's from Yahoo Answers user, Mr. Brightside

1054
00:48:15,120 --> 00:48:20,000
who asks, how many calories are in a 2016 Silverado HD pickup truck?

1055
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:23,520
And I included it because the answer is so good.

1056
00:48:23,520 --> 00:48:24,880
It's from Gabe who says,

1057
00:48:24,880 --> 00:48:26,720
this is my favorite question of all time.

1058
00:48:26,720 --> 00:48:28,240
Answer, enough.

1059
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:37,040
This one was sent in by Lindsay Waterman though.

1060
00:48:37,040 --> 00:48:37,600
Thank you, Lindsay.

1061
00:48:37,600 --> 00:48:39,760
It's by Yahoo Answers user, Sarah, who asks,

1062
00:48:41,520 --> 00:48:44,240
what is the cutest way to cuss?

1063
00:48:44,880 --> 00:48:47,280
We are really gonna earn that explicit tag with this segment,

1064
00:48:47,280 --> 00:48:47,760
I feel like.

1065
00:48:49,120 --> 00:48:50,160
Put the kids to bed.

1066
00:48:50,160 --> 00:48:51,200
It's about to get blue.

1067
00:48:51,200 --> 00:48:55,200
Oh, bubble jugs.

1068
00:48:55,200 --> 00:48:57,280
Dude, she had the choicest bubble jugs.

1069
00:48:57,280 --> 00:48:59,760
Did you check out the bubble jugs on her?

1070
00:48:59,760 --> 00:49:00,000
I respect them.

1071
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:01,600
So fucking juicy, dude.

1072
00:49:01,600 --> 00:49:05,840
Wait, are you suggesting that that Pauly D voice

1073
00:49:05,840 --> 00:49:07,120
is the cutest way to cuss?

1074
00:49:08,880 --> 00:49:09,600
Let me try again.

1075
00:49:09,600 --> 00:49:11,200
I was trying to do baby Pauly D.

1076
00:49:11,200 --> 00:49:13,280
Yeah, do more baby less Pauly D.

1077
00:49:14,160 --> 00:49:16,960
Yo, dude, she had the biggest bubble jugs.

1078
00:49:16,960 --> 00:49:17,680
I loved them.

1079
00:49:17,680 --> 00:49:20,560
It's to me, baby Pauly D.

1080
00:49:20,560 --> 00:49:24,080
Jim tan laundry nap.

1081
00:49:27,280 --> 00:49:30,080
GTLN, ta ta for now.

1082
00:49:30,080 --> 00:49:32,560
I love Tigger.

1083
00:49:32,560 --> 00:49:34,480
I made boom boom in my diapy.

1084
00:49:34,480 --> 00:49:35,280
Look at the jugs.

1085
00:49:35,280 --> 00:49:36,880
I made a boom boom.

1086
00:49:38,080 --> 00:49:40,240
I love breastfeeding for a lot of reasons.

1087
00:49:40,960 --> 00:49:43,920
Why don't you guys come over and make some menace throne

1088
00:49:43,920 --> 00:49:44,960
and then blend it up?

1089
00:49:44,960 --> 00:49:46,240
I ain't got teeth.

1090
00:49:46,240 --> 00:49:48,000
Don't leave me in the hot tub.

1091
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:48,720
I'm a baby.

1092
00:49:50,480 --> 00:49:51,440
Gotta love me.

1093
00:49:52,640 --> 00:49:54,160
Not the mama, please.

1094
00:49:54,160 --> 00:49:55,440
Please, God, I hope so.

1095
00:49:58,400 --> 00:49:59,840
I forgot the question.

1096
00:49:59,840 --> 00:50:02,560
What's the cutest way to cuss?

1097
00:50:03,680 --> 00:50:06,960
Like a baby version of a jolly Jersey Shore character.

1098
00:50:06,960 --> 00:50:11,600
This is tough because are we talking like non cuss word,

1099
00:50:11,600 --> 00:50:13,920
cuss words, or are we talking like,

1100
00:50:13,920 --> 00:50:18,080
oh, fuck, like what's the cutest way to deliver a cuss word

1101
00:50:18,080 --> 00:50:20,080
or what's the cutest non cuss word, cuss word?

1102
00:50:22,400 --> 00:50:24,160
Let me just blast through some of these answers

1103
00:50:24,160 --> 00:50:27,680
because Terrence J's future girlfriend says

1104
00:50:28,160 --> 00:50:29,600
there is an acute way to cuss

1105
00:50:29,600 --> 00:50:31,680
because cussing is not attractive.

1106
00:50:31,680 --> 00:50:32,480
Wrong.

1107
00:50:32,480 --> 00:50:33,600
Oh, shit.

1108
00:50:33,600 --> 00:50:34,320
Wrong.

1109
00:50:35,040 --> 00:50:36,400
These are ugly words.

1110
00:50:37,440 --> 00:50:40,000
But when someone can really stick the landing

1111
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:42,000
on a good curse word, aren't you like,

1112
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:44,240
good curse word, aren't you like, damn,

1113
00:50:45,280 --> 00:50:46,720
I felt that from over here.

1114
00:50:47,280 --> 00:50:49,760
When my baby drops a popsicle on the ground,

1115
00:50:49,760 --> 00:50:51,120
she looks at it and she gives it

1116
00:50:51,120 --> 00:50:52,800
the perfect amount of breathing room

1117
00:50:52,800 --> 00:50:54,640
and then just says, shit.

1118
00:50:57,760 --> 00:50:59,040
That might actually be it.

1119
00:50:59,040 --> 00:51:01,120
It's actually like a really cute way of cussing

1120
00:51:01,120 --> 00:51:02,640
because like, I don't care.

1121
00:51:02,640 --> 00:51:04,560
Like, I don't care if she cusses, she's a baby.

1122
00:51:04,560 --> 00:51:06,240
She'll just drop it on the ground and look at it and go,

1123
00:51:06,960 --> 00:51:07,680
oh, shit.

1124
00:51:07,680 --> 00:51:09,680
I don't like, no, I will say, I will say,

1125
00:51:09,680 --> 00:51:12,640
I don't like, I will say, I don't like when I get on Facebook

1126
00:51:12,640 --> 00:51:14,880
and I see a little video and the parents are like,

1127
00:51:14,880 --> 00:51:17,280
obviously like, they've developed this sort of

1128
00:51:17,280 --> 00:51:18,800
Pavlovian response in their kids

1129
00:51:18,800 --> 00:51:20,720
to make them say the word fuck for candy

1130
00:51:20,720 --> 00:51:21,520
or something like that.

1131
00:51:22,720 --> 00:51:24,640
And it's like, I can tell what you're doing there

1132
00:51:24,640 --> 00:51:27,360
and it's like, great, that's gonna be great viral content.

1133
00:51:27,360 --> 00:51:29,040
But that's not, I don't like that.

1134
00:51:29,040 --> 00:51:30,320
I don't think I like that.

1135
00:51:30,320 --> 00:51:30,820
Fuck.

1136
00:51:31,680 --> 00:51:32,000
Get it?

1137
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:32,720
You said fuck.

1138
00:51:32,720 --> 00:51:35,360
I did get it, but I don't like it.

1139
00:51:35,360 --> 00:51:37,440
I like that ugly word.

1140
00:51:37,440 --> 00:51:39,200
I do like that ugly word.

1141
00:51:39,200 --> 00:51:40,640
But you gotta use it responsibly.

1142
00:51:41,840 --> 00:51:44,240
My problem with children and cussing

1143
00:51:44,240 --> 00:51:46,320
is that I think the exact age

1144
00:51:46,960 --> 00:51:49,760
at which I will probably need to teach my daughter

1145
00:51:49,760 --> 00:51:51,440
restraint in profanity

1146
00:51:51,440 --> 00:51:54,320
is the exact age where she'll look me fucking dead in the eye

1147
00:51:54,320 --> 00:51:57,600
and say, you make your living saying dick into a microphone.

1148
00:51:57,600 --> 00:52:00,240
Get out of my fucking face, old man.

1149
00:52:01,200 --> 00:52:01,700
What?

1150
00:52:02,560 --> 00:52:03,920
I was just thinking about this.

1151
00:52:04,560 --> 00:52:05,600
And this is weird.

1152
00:52:05,600 --> 00:52:08,240
Nobody really says the word bastard anymore.

1153
00:52:08,240 --> 00:52:10,240
Saying it, saying it feels weird.

1154
00:52:10,240 --> 00:52:13,280
When I say it, I feel like Christopher Guest's character

1155
00:52:13,280 --> 00:52:14,400
in Waiting for Guffman.

1156
00:52:15,360 --> 00:52:16,640
You're bastard people.

1157
00:52:16,640 --> 00:52:17,840
You're just bastard.

1158
00:52:17,840 --> 00:52:19,360
You're bastard people.

1159
00:52:19,360 --> 00:52:21,520
There's no, there's nobody said,

1160
00:52:21,520 --> 00:52:24,320
like there's other words that have substituted that.

1161
00:52:24,320 --> 00:52:26,960
Like, I like piece, you're a piece of shit.

1162
00:52:26,960 --> 00:52:30,720
I think part of what has ruined it is Game of Thrones

1163
00:52:30,720 --> 00:52:32,880
because bastard, we are reminded,

1164
00:52:32,880 --> 00:52:34,400
has a very literal meaning.

1165
00:52:34,400 --> 00:52:35,760
It has a very literal meaning

1166
00:52:35,760 --> 00:52:37,680
that that show uses quite literally.

1167
00:52:37,680 --> 00:52:39,760
Like it's not a generic,

1168
00:52:41,040 --> 00:52:43,760
it has been reclaimed by real bastards.

1169
00:52:43,760 --> 00:52:45,520
Everyone say it, say it.

1170
00:52:45,520 --> 00:52:46,480
Bastard.

1171
00:52:46,480 --> 00:52:47,200
Bastard.

1172
00:52:47,200 --> 00:52:47,680
Bastard.

1173
00:52:47,680 --> 00:52:50,160
It sounds, maybe it's got turd in it.

1174
00:52:50,160 --> 00:52:52,160
I don't know what it is, but it sounds, it's,

1175
00:52:52,160 --> 00:52:55,600
maybe we bring, this week it's all bastards and bubble jugs.

1176
00:52:55,600 --> 00:52:56,720
That's what we're bringing back.

1177
00:52:59,280 --> 00:53:00,320
It's getting really worried.

1178
00:53:00,320 --> 00:53:02,640
We weren't gonna have an episode title in there, but.

1179
00:53:02,640 --> 00:53:03,920
Bastards and bubble jugs.

1180
00:53:03,920 --> 00:53:04,720
Bastard.

1181
00:53:04,720 --> 00:53:06,240
What do you guys think?

1182
00:53:06,240 --> 00:53:08,560
Time for another question or whatever you want to do.

1183
00:53:08,560 --> 00:53:11,120
Yeah, one of my coworkers recently invited me

1184
00:53:11,120 --> 00:53:12,400
to celebrate her impending,

1185
00:53:12,400 --> 00:53:13,680
actually, you know what, before I read this,

1186
00:53:13,680 --> 00:53:16,240
Travis, what's the best one that we haven't done yet?

1187
00:53:16,240 --> 00:53:17,040
That one.

1188
00:53:17,040 --> 00:53:19,680
Okay, one of my coworkers recently invited me

1189
00:53:19,680 --> 00:53:22,800
to celebrate her impending marriage with a day at the spa.

1190
00:53:23,760 --> 00:53:26,320
This would be fine, except that this particular spa

1191
00:53:26,320 --> 00:53:29,600
requires all patrons to be completely naked at all times.

1192
00:53:29,600 --> 00:53:30,400
Oh, nice.

1193
00:53:30,400 --> 00:53:34,240
Oh, nice.

1194
00:53:34,240 --> 00:53:35,440
So fucking choice.

1195
00:53:37,440 --> 00:53:38,880
I see all these boobies walk around.

1196
00:53:38,880 --> 00:53:40,320
I'm like, mm, lunch.

1197
00:53:40,320 --> 00:53:41,920
Get out in bubble jugs.

1198
00:53:41,920 --> 00:53:43,600
Get them bubble jugs out, mommy.

1199
00:53:44,800 --> 00:53:45,760
Are you my mommy?

1200
00:53:45,760 --> 00:53:47,280
By the way, I meant to ask.

1201
00:53:47,280 --> 00:53:48,160
I'm so scared.

1202
00:53:48,880 --> 00:53:49,920
I'm so scared.

1203
00:53:49,920 --> 00:53:51,040
All the lights are so bright.

1204
00:53:51,920 --> 00:53:52,400
Other people.

1205
00:53:52,400 --> 00:53:53,680
Loud noises.

1206
00:53:53,680 --> 00:53:54,800
Loud noises.

1207
00:53:54,800 --> 00:53:57,600
My mommy went around a corner and she stopped existing.

1208
00:53:57,600 --> 00:53:57,920
Yo.

1209
00:53:58,480 --> 00:53:58,720
Yo.

1210
00:53:58,720 --> 00:53:59,680
Yo.

1211
00:53:59,680 --> 00:54:02,480
Other people attending this get together

1212
00:54:02,480 --> 00:54:06,080
include our boss and her husband and my coworker's fiance

1213
00:54:06,080 --> 00:54:07,520
who is in his 70s.

1214
00:54:07,520 --> 00:54:09,760
My coworker and I are both in our late 20s.

1215
00:54:09,760 --> 00:54:12,320
I want to support my friend, but I

1216
00:54:12,320 --> 00:54:15,920
can live without exposing my business to all and sundry.

1217
00:54:15,920 --> 00:54:18,240
Is there a way to make this less awkward?

1218
00:54:18,240 --> 00:54:20,480
If I don't go, do I risk being alienated at work

1219
00:54:20,480 --> 00:54:22,800
because I'm the only one who hasn't seen everybody's junk?

1220
00:54:22,800 --> 00:54:25,600
Okay, wait.

1221
00:54:25,600 --> 00:54:28,240
Okay, any advice to be appreciated?

1222
00:54:28,240 --> 00:54:30,640
That's from can I at least get a towel in New York?

1223
00:54:30,640 --> 00:54:34,400
I was so ready to tell this person, like, just don't go.

1224
00:54:34,400 --> 00:54:37,040
Like, you're an adult and you don't want to go be naked with everybody.

1225
00:54:37,040 --> 00:54:40,640
But then they made the point that what if everyone's standing around the office

1226
00:54:40,640 --> 00:54:43,440
on the following Monday having a good laugh and you're like,

1227
00:54:43,440 --> 00:54:44,560
hey, what are you guys laughing about?

1228
00:54:44,560 --> 00:54:45,680
And they're like, you wouldn't understand.

1229
00:54:45,680 --> 00:54:46,880
You didn't see Todd's penis.

1230
00:54:49,840 --> 00:54:51,200
Todd's penis becomes the office.

1231
00:54:51,200 --> 00:54:51,680
End joke.

1232
00:54:51,680 --> 00:54:53,120
Yo, Todd, how's that weird ball?

1233
00:54:54,400 --> 00:54:55,440
You got me again.

1234
00:54:55,440 --> 00:54:56,640
Wait, what's up with this ball?

1235
00:54:56,640 --> 00:54:57,520
Don't worry about it.

1236
00:54:57,520 --> 00:54:57,840
Don't worry.

1237
00:54:57,840 --> 00:55:00,400
You really had to be there and see Todd's ball.

1238
00:55:00,400 --> 00:55:02,560
What the fuck's wrong with you asking a question like that?

1239
00:55:03,120 --> 00:55:04,640
I'll see Todd's ball now.

1240
00:55:04,640 --> 00:55:06,560
No, it was the context.

1241
00:55:06,560 --> 00:55:08,480
Todd, get your ball out right now.

1242
00:55:09,840 --> 00:55:15,280
I'm sick of you guys holding Todd's ball over my head.

1243
00:55:15,280 --> 00:55:16,480
He's very flexible.

1244
00:55:16,480 --> 00:55:17,040
I'll give you that.

1245
00:55:17,040 --> 00:55:20,240
And you're all very strong to lift Todd's ball the way up there.

1246
00:55:20,240 --> 00:55:23,840
It's there, but then I turn around and he's covered it and I'm sick of it.

1247
00:55:25,040 --> 00:55:27,760
Thank you, Susan, for coming to your annual review.

1248
00:55:27,760 --> 00:55:29,280
Boy, it's been kind of a weird year, huh?

1249
00:55:32,080 --> 00:55:34,320
Thick, thick document this year, huh, Susan?

1250
00:55:34,880 --> 00:55:35,920
Kind of a weird one, huh?

1251
00:55:35,920 --> 00:55:36,640
Kind of wacky.

1252
00:55:37,600 --> 00:55:40,400
It just seems like it's a back and forth of HR complaints.

1253
00:55:40,400 --> 00:55:42,240
You and Todd, Todd and you.

1254
00:55:42,240 --> 00:55:44,160
It's just, it seems endless.

1255
00:55:44,160 --> 00:55:46,880
You need to let go of this whole Todd's weird ball thing.

1256
00:55:46,880 --> 00:55:48,160
Can you put like, what is it?

1257
00:55:49,200 --> 00:55:52,400
We put this one into arbitration and they have actually sided with you.

1258
00:55:52,400 --> 00:55:53,440
Todd, get that nut out.

1259
00:55:54,080 --> 00:55:55,920
I need to know it's a telltale ball.

1260
00:55:55,920 --> 00:55:58,080
I need to know that it's driving me crazy.

1261
00:55:58,080 --> 00:56:04,560
I wonder if when these people are back at the office and if it's just them in a meeting,

1262
00:56:04,560 --> 00:56:05,840
do you think it crosses their mind?

1263
00:56:05,840 --> 00:56:07,440
Like, why are we wearing clothes?

1264
00:56:07,440 --> 00:56:08,880
Why are we wasting our time here?

1265
00:56:08,880 --> 00:56:09,760
We should-

1266
00:56:09,760 --> 00:56:11,600
It's super casual Friday.

1267
00:56:11,600 --> 00:56:13,600
This is super duper casual Friday.

1268
00:56:16,320 --> 00:56:19,760
First, I mean, the good advice that's going to help get you through this is just like,

1269
00:56:20,640 --> 00:56:22,160
close your eyes, repeat after me.

1270
00:56:22,160 --> 00:56:24,960
I'm just hot tubbing in the Japanese style.

1271
00:56:24,960 --> 00:56:26,960
They don't let you cover up your ding-dong over there.

1272
00:56:27,840 --> 00:56:32,000
And you don't know, it's weird to be in a place where you don't understand the language

1273
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:36,880
and you know just the baseline of the cultural norms and then you are also put in the situations

1274
00:56:36,880 --> 00:56:42,240
where there's just everybody, it is just a brain convention.

1275
00:56:42,240 --> 00:56:42,800
You know what I mean?

1276
00:56:42,800 --> 00:56:44,240
You know what, Griffin?

1277
00:56:44,240 --> 00:56:47,920
You have changed my mind because I choked at the beginning that you should just not go.

1278
00:56:47,920 --> 00:56:53,680
But like, it's not like you've been invited to an Eyes Wide Shut orgy.

1279
00:56:53,680 --> 00:56:55,200
Like everyone's just going to be naked.

1280
00:56:55,200 --> 00:56:56,160
It's going to be okay.

1281
00:56:56,800 --> 00:57:02,640
Maybe you should just go and expand your perception of like humanity and like the human body.

1282
00:57:02,640 --> 00:57:03,840
No, the human body is beautiful.

1283
00:57:03,840 --> 00:57:09,920
But I'm not, I get that like some people are uncomfortable with this.

1284
00:57:09,920 --> 00:57:16,240
Truth be told, I was wicked, very wholly uncomfortable with the wholeness of my being.

1285
00:57:16,240 --> 00:57:18,160
I just thought I'd try it because I was in Japan.

1286
00:57:18,160 --> 00:57:22,480
I don't think I would do it if I was just like in some spa in New York state.

1287
00:57:23,920 --> 00:57:27,200
But I think if you get that in that mindset, it might help out.

1288
00:57:28,400 --> 00:57:29,760
Yeah, but yeah, that's what I'm saying.

1289
00:57:29,760 --> 00:57:33,520
It's like, I don't think it's going to hurt you.

1290
00:57:33,520 --> 00:57:35,760
It's the co-workers that is the bad thing.

1291
00:57:35,760 --> 00:57:40,000
I don't think it's the being nude around other people like, fuck that, whatever.

1292
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:41,120
It's the being around the co-workers.

1293
00:57:41,120 --> 00:57:42,880
I'm thinking about it now with my co-workers.

1294
00:57:42,880 --> 00:57:46,160
Like that's going to be an uncomfy Monday, isn't it?

1295
00:57:46,720 --> 00:57:49,200
Like if I was Garfield, I would hate that Monday extra.

1296
00:57:49,200 --> 00:57:51,840
What if it's like the biggest team building exercise though?

1297
00:57:51,840 --> 00:57:54,000
Like you think like, oh, this is going to be so uncomfortable Monday,

1298
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:57,200
but actually Monday is the first time you finally have the confidence to like

1299
00:57:57,200 --> 00:57:59,840
tell Derek that you don't like when he listens to NPR in the morning

1300
00:57:59,840 --> 00:58:02,080
because you're just trying to like warm up and have some coffee

1301
00:58:02,080 --> 00:58:04,160
and he's like blasting car talk or whatever.

1302
00:58:04,160 --> 00:58:06,000
I take that back because car talk is amazing,

1303
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:08,560
but maybe it's the first time that you feel comfortable saying something

1304
00:58:08,560 --> 00:58:09,840
because you've seen his butthole.

1305
00:58:09,840 --> 00:58:12,480
Just because you've seen Derek's butthole, you can finally be like,

1306
00:58:12,480 --> 00:58:14,480
ah, fuck car talk.

1307
00:58:14,480 --> 00:58:16,080
Oh God, that feels good.

1308
00:58:16,080 --> 00:58:18,080
Derek, your butthole gave me the confidence to do it.

1309
00:58:19,760 --> 00:58:21,120
Thanks for getting that bad boy out.

1310
00:58:21,840 --> 00:58:24,240
We've got nothing left to hide from each other, Derek.

1311
00:58:24,240 --> 00:58:25,280
I hate car talk.

1312
00:58:27,680 --> 00:58:28,880
Nobody hates car talk.

1313
00:58:28,880 --> 00:58:29,840
Nobody hates car talk.

1314
00:58:29,840 --> 00:58:30,480
It's so good.

1315
00:58:30,480 --> 00:58:32,400
I don't, I don't, I don't know what to tell you.

1316
00:58:32,400 --> 00:58:36,800
Cause like I, this sounds, I'm, I would get in any spa.

1317
00:58:36,800 --> 00:58:39,680
Anytime I'm offered a spa trip, I take it every time.

1318
00:58:39,680 --> 00:58:40,480
I treat myself.

1319
00:58:40,480 --> 00:58:42,240
I don't know if I've talked to you guys about this.

1320
00:58:42,240 --> 00:58:44,480
I treat myself to a massage every month.

1321
00:58:44,480 --> 00:58:46,160
I found a little massage place nearby.

1322
00:58:46,160 --> 00:58:47,280
It does them pretty cheap.

1323
00:58:47,280 --> 00:58:49,920
Get an hour deep, deep tissue every month.

1324
00:58:49,920 --> 00:58:50,960
Just do a little something.

1325
00:58:50,960 --> 00:58:57,360
It's like, it's like the, the detective guy from Twin Peaks said in that one scene,

1326
00:58:57,360 --> 00:58:59,680
you gotta do something for yourself every day.

1327
00:58:59,680 --> 00:59:01,760
And for me, it's every once a month and I get a massage.

1328
00:59:01,760 --> 00:59:03,120
So treat yourself to that.

1329
00:59:03,120 --> 00:59:05,360
Enjoy the experience, the luxury of that.

1330
00:59:05,360 --> 00:59:08,400
But I do get, I don't know how you get past the fact that you're going to see

1331
00:59:08,400 --> 00:59:11,680
your boss's 70 year old balls.

1332
00:59:11,680 --> 00:59:14,560
I'll tell you, I think this is the question you got to ask yourself.

1333
00:59:16,080 --> 00:59:17,760
Are you okay with 70 year old balls?

1334
00:59:17,760 --> 00:59:22,800
Are you sitting there thinking, I would go, but I'm afraid it's uncomfortable.

1335
00:59:22,800 --> 00:59:27,280
Or are you thinking I have 100,000% zero interest in going?

1336
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:28,560
Like, yeah.

1337
00:59:29,920 --> 00:59:30,240
Yeah.

1338
00:59:30,240 --> 00:59:31,280
If it's just like, you know what?

1339
00:59:31,280 --> 00:59:33,920
I would go, but I'm afraid it's going to be uncomfortable.

1340
00:59:33,920 --> 00:59:34,800
You should go.

1341
00:59:34,800 --> 00:59:38,080
If you're like, I, I do not want to go at all.

1342
00:59:38,080 --> 00:59:39,920
You have complete autonomy over your life.

1343
00:59:39,920 --> 00:59:41,040
Do not go to that thing.

1344
00:59:42,400 --> 00:59:45,760
It's not, it's going to, you've just pitched a scenario

1345
00:59:45,760 --> 00:59:47,920
where there's a chance it won't be uncomfortable.

1346
00:59:47,920 --> 00:59:49,920
And to me, I just like to play that scene out

1347
00:59:49,920 --> 00:59:53,040
where you come out of the dressing room nude in the spa zone

1348
00:59:53,040 --> 00:59:55,040
and everyone's just like, yeah, cool.

1349
00:59:57,920 --> 01:00:01,600
Everybody sees your boss and they're like, I love how old it is down there.

1350
01:00:02,240 --> 01:00:04,720
I like how mature and wizened it is.

1351
01:00:04,720 --> 01:00:06,560
Greg, I've never seen one like that before.

1352
01:00:06,560 --> 01:00:07,360
Neat.

1353
01:00:07,360 --> 01:00:08,480
Have a seat next to me.

1354
01:00:08,480 --> 01:00:10,320
You did great with your testicles.

1355
01:00:10,320 --> 01:00:11,280
Neat balls, Greg.

1356
01:00:12,160 --> 01:00:13,840
Those testicles are besticles.

1357
01:00:13,840 --> 01:00:15,040
Sit on down.

1358
01:00:15,040 --> 01:00:15,920
But be careful.

1359
01:00:15,920 --> 01:00:16,560
But be careful.

1360
01:00:16,560 --> 01:00:17,840
You don't want to belvedere yourself.

1361
01:00:20,800 --> 01:00:25,040
At 70, the leading causes of trauma is falling.

1362
01:00:25,040 --> 01:00:26,960
Just like, oh, it's just falling down.

1363
01:00:26,960 --> 01:00:28,480
But the other one is belvedering.

1364
01:00:28,480 --> 01:00:35,040
I'd like for you both to read these pamphlets.

1365
01:00:35,040 --> 01:00:44,800
I don't know what it is and I'm afraid to ask.

1366
01:00:44,800 --> 01:00:48,320
The worst part is at that age, if you sit on a roll, it'll just pop.

1367
01:00:49,520 --> 01:00:50,960
Like an overripe grape.

1368
01:00:50,960 --> 01:00:53,440
Just like, and you'll hear that noise, you'll know.

1369
01:00:54,560 --> 01:00:56,240
And then it'll definitely be awkward.

1370
01:00:56,960 --> 01:00:58,160
Then it'll be super awkward.

1371
01:00:58,160 --> 01:01:00,880
This pamphlet is called Streaks on the Epididymis.

1372
01:01:00,880 --> 01:01:02,720
And it's important you read it cover to cover.

1373
01:01:05,920 --> 01:01:07,600
The life you save might be your own.

1374
01:01:11,440 --> 01:01:14,080
So this has been our podcast, My Brother, My Brother, and Me.

1375
01:01:14,080 --> 01:01:15,040
We hope you had fun.

1376
01:01:15,040 --> 01:01:18,080
Got the little checklist here.

1377
01:01:18,080 --> 01:01:20,720
I'm checking Epididymis off it.

1378
01:01:20,720 --> 01:01:21,520
Said that on the show.

1379
01:01:21,520 --> 01:01:22,240
OK, here we go.

1380
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:24,880
Guess what?

1381
01:01:24,880 --> 01:01:26,960
We're coming this weekend to New York and DC.

1382
01:01:26,960 --> 01:01:28,080
Tickets to that are sold out.

1383
01:01:29,120 --> 01:01:30,560
But if you're coming to those shows,

1384
01:01:31,280 --> 01:01:33,600
get fucking ready to get weird because it's going to be fun.

1385
01:01:33,600 --> 01:01:34,240
But guess what?

1386
01:01:34,240 --> 01:01:35,280
Even more.

1387
01:01:35,280 --> 01:01:35,680
Guess what?

1388
01:01:35,680 --> 01:01:36,240
Even more.

1389
01:01:36,880 --> 01:01:37,840
Got more shows.

1390
01:01:37,840 --> 01:01:38,340
What?

1391
01:01:39,920 --> 01:01:44,080
July the 15th and 16th, the three of us

1392
01:01:44,080 --> 01:01:48,960
are going to be performing in Boston at the Wilbur Theater

1393
01:01:48,960 --> 01:01:50,240
because Boston asked for it.

1394
01:01:50,240 --> 01:01:51,760
So we're making it happen.

1395
01:01:51,760 --> 01:01:52,640
Now, Justin.

1396
01:01:52,640 --> 01:01:54,080
Rest of the country, I get it.

1397
01:01:54,080 --> 01:01:55,440
The rest of the country, I get it.

1398
01:01:55,440 --> 01:01:59,280
Like, I know that we're kind of sticking to the Upper East

1399
01:01:59,280 --> 01:02:00,480
Coast a little bit here.

1400
01:02:00,480 --> 01:02:03,680
But we've never done Boston before, like, ever.

1401
01:02:03,680 --> 01:02:08,800
And the demand there is very enthusiastic.

1402
01:02:08,800 --> 01:02:10,960
And so we're just going to, like, knock it out,

1403
01:02:10,960 --> 01:02:12,400
give Boston the best night of their lives,

1404
01:02:12,400 --> 01:02:13,360
two nights of their lives.

1405
01:02:13,920 --> 01:02:17,360
But the coolest part about this is the Saturday,

1406
01:02:17,360 --> 01:02:20,160
which is the 16th, right?

1407
01:02:20,160 --> 01:02:20,960
Look at the calendar here.

1408
01:02:20,960 --> 01:02:22,000
Make sure I'm saying this right.

1409
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:29,600
All right, on the 15th and 16th, the 16th,

1410
01:02:29,600 --> 01:02:31,760
we are going to be performing My Brother, My Brother,

1411
01:02:31,760 --> 01:02:34,000
and Me at the Wilbur Theater.

1412
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:34,960
Yeah, it's this one.

1413
01:02:36,160 --> 01:02:37,680
And Travis, what's the link if people

1414
01:02:37,680 --> 01:02:38,880
want to buy tickets to that?

1415
01:02:38,880 --> 01:02:43,200
That is bit.ly forward slash M-B-M-B-A-M Boston.

1416
01:02:43,200 --> 01:02:44,320
All lowercase.

1417
01:02:44,320 --> 01:02:46,560
They will go on sale very soon.

1418
01:02:46,560 --> 01:02:48,080
They will go on sale.

1419
01:02:48,080 --> 01:02:50,160
Wednesday at noon Eastern.

1420
01:02:50,160 --> 01:02:54,240
And that's going to be at the Wilbur Theater in Boston.

1421
01:02:54,240 --> 01:02:57,120
Those tickets will go on sale, what do we say, just now?

1422
01:02:57,120 --> 01:02:58,880
Wednesday, noon Eastern.

1423
01:02:58,880 --> 01:03:02,320
So Wednesday, June 1st, noon Eastern time.

1424
01:03:03,440 --> 01:03:07,840
And those are going, okay, let me put it this way.

1425
01:03:07,840 --> 01:03:13,200
Our show in New York was at a slightly larger venue

1426
01:03:13,200 --> 01:03:14,320
and it sold out in two hours.

1427
01:03:14,320 --> 01:03:17,440
So please, or like three hours, please don't sleep on that.

1428
01:03:17,440 --> 01:03:19,280
Please, if you want tickets, just buy them.

1429
01:03:19,280 --> 01:03:21,600
And come, because it's going to be fun.

1430
01:03:21,600 --> 01:03:23,200
Now here's the crazier part.

1431
01:03:23,200 --> 01:03:25,520
The day before that, on Friday,

1432
01:03:25,520 --> 01:03:30,520
we're doing our first ever publicly attendable live episode

1433
01:03:32,400 --> 01:03:33,680
of the Adventure Zone.

1434
01:03:33,680 --> 01:03:36,640
We did one at LA PodFest that was only available

1435
01:03:36,640 --> 01:03:38,000
if you were attending PodFest.

1436
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:39,360
It was crazy.

1437
01:03:39,360 --> 01:03:41,280
It was a crazy good time.

1438
01:03:41,280 --> 01:03:43,360
And now we're opening it up to everyone in Boston

1439
01:03:43,360 --> 01:03:44,720
and the surrounding area.

1440
01:03:44,720 --> 01:03:46,640
My Brother, My Brother, Me is fun,

1441
01:03:46,640 --> 01:03:49,040
but the Adventure Zone is going to be a vicious cycle.

1442
01:03:49,040 --> 01:03:50,080
It's going to be a visual spectacle.

1443
01:03:50,080 --> 01:03:51,200
There are costumes.

1444
01:03:51,200 --> 01:03:52,040
That's all I'm saying.

1445
01:03:52,040 --> 01:03:53,280
There are costumes and props.

1446
01:03:53,280 --> 01:03:55,360
And there's a very good chance that our dad will be there

1447
01:03:55,360 --> 01:03:56,560
because he's like in it.

1448
01:03:56,560 --> 01:03:58,000
And there's a great chance I'm going to be like,

1449
01:03:58,000 --> 01:04:00,440
super nervous.

1450
01:04:00,440 --> 01:04:01,280
You don't want to miss that.

1451
01:04:01,280 --> 01:04:02,480
And if you have any interest in that,

1452
01:04:02,480 --> 01:04:04,080
if you're like, it can't,

1453
01:04:04,080 --> 01:04:06,880
like I cannot foresee live Adventure Zones

1454
01:04:06,880 --> 01:04:09,120
being ever being something that we do a lot.

1455
01:04:09,120 --> 01:04:12,360
So like, if you can get there, please get there

1456
01:04:12,360 --> 01:04:14,720
because there will not be a lot of opportunities

1457
01:04:14,720 --> 01:04:16,240
in like all of your life.

1458
01:04:16,240 --> 01:04:17,080
It's a really hard,

1459
01:04:17,080 --> 01:04:19,560
it's a very, very difficult show to do live.

1460
01:04:19,560 --> 01:04:20,480
Super duper hard.

1461
01:04:20,480 --> 01:04:22,320
So we don't do them that often.

1462
01:04:22,320 --> 01:04:23,640
I'm excited to do this one though.

1463
01:04:23,640 --> 01:04:25,920
I've got a great idea for it.

1464
01:04:25,920 --> 01:04:29,000
And those tickets are available at bit.ly forward slash

1465
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:30,520
Taz Boston.

1466
01:04:30,520 --> 01:04:31,360
That was a hint.

1467
01:04:31,360 --> 01:04:32,200
That was a hint by the way,

1468
01:04:32,200 --> 01:04:33,520
about what the episode will be about.

1469
01:04:33,520 --> 01:04:34,680
I see.

1470
01:04:34,680 --> 01:04:35,960
We're also working on a deal.

1471
01:04:35,960 --> 01:04:37,600
So each of those, the tickets are,

1472
01:04:37,600 --> 01:04:40,360
I believe $26 total or $26.

1473
01:04:40,360 --> 01:04:42,840
And we're doing the plus one thing again.

1474
01:04:42,840 --> 01:04:44,280
So one of those dollars will be donated

1475
01:04:44,280 --> 01:04:46,080
to a charitable cause.

1476
01:04:46,080 --> 01:04:47,120
It's called Branches.

1477
01:04:47,120 --> 01:04:49,680
It's a domestic violence shelter here in Huntington.

1478
01:04:49,680 --> 01:04:52,520
We're working on a deal where you can get tickets

1479
01:04:52,520 --> 01:04:56,040
to both shows for $40 total,

1480
01:04:56,040 --> 01:04:58,000
but there will be a limited amount of those.

1481
01:04:58,000 --> 01:05:00,000
I think 250 total.

1482
01:05:01,280 --> 01:05:05,080
You can get the combo tickets at bit.ly forward slash

1483
01:05:05,080 --> 01:05:08,240
Boston Combo all lowercase.

1484
01:05:08,240 --> 01:05:10,520
And like I said, there's a limited amount of those.

1485
01:05:10,520 --> 01:05:11,800
You can still buy tickets to both

1486
01:05:11,800 --> 01:05:13,560
even after those have sold out.

1487
01:05:13,560 --> 01:05:16,680
But if you're looking to maybe capitalize

1488
01:05:16,680 --> 01:05:18,040
on the fact that we're doing two shows

1489
01:05:18,040 --> 01:05:19,680
in the same town back to back,

1490
01:05:19,680 --> 01:05:21,400
you're gonna wanna move on those combo tickets

1491
01:05:21,400 --> 01:05:22,680
pretty quickly.

1492
01:05:22,680 --> 01:05:26,120
Now the Boston Combo is also my favorite sexual act.

1493
01:05:26,120 --> 01:05:27,920
And let me describe to you what goes into it.

1494
01:05:27,920 --> 01:05:29,120
I'd rather we didn't.

1495
01:05:29,120 --> 01:05:30,880
Thanks to John Rogers and the Long Winders

1496
01:05:30,880 --> 01:05:31,760
for the use of the theme song

1497
01:05:31,760 --> 01:05:32,800
instead of departure off the album,

1498
01:05:32,800 --> 01:05:34,440
put in the days to Ben.

1499
01:05:34,440 --> 01:05:35,280
Like we said earlier,

1500
01:05:35,280 --> 01:05:36,760
we've got those live shows coming up this weekend.

1501
01:05:36,760 --> 01:05:40,600
So please send in Yahoo's and questions

1502
01:05:40,600 --> 01:05:43,640
and label them DC and NYC in the subject line.

1503
01:05:43,640 --> 01:05:46,320
And we're gonna have audience questions,

1504
01:05:46,320 --> 01:05:47,440
live audience questions.

1505
01:05:47,440 --> 01:05:49,520
So start thinking about what those questions are gonna be.

1506
01:05:49,520 --> 01:05:51,680
One rule of course, no bummers.

1507
01:05:51,680 --> 01:05:53,160
Yeah.

1508
01:05:53,160 --> 01:05:56,480
Also just keep in mind just to get it out there.

1509
01:05:56,480 --> 01:05:59,720
We always intend on doing meet and greets,

1510
01:05:59,720 --> 01:06:02,400
but now we're traveling with like a basically

1511
01:06:02,400 --> 01:06:04,840
two year old child and my pregnant wife.

1512
01:06:04,840 --> 01:06:07,560
And so I can't guarantee that everyone will be

1513
01:06:07,560 --> 01:06:09,960
in a physical shape to do a meet and greet.

1514
01:06:09,960 --> 01:06:12,200
So if we do not, I so, so apologize.

1515
01:06:12,200 --> 01:06:13,600
I just want to get it out there

1516
01:06:13,600 --> 01:06:15,080
that there is a possibility that we do not,

1517
01:06:15,080 --> 01:06:16,400
but we're definitely gonna try to.

1518
01:06:16,400 --> 01:06:17,840
Yeah, we're trying to be as like,

1519
01:06:17,840 --> 01:06:20,480
I really, I want, like I want to,

1520
01:06:20,480 --> 01:06:21,480
but we have basically become

1521
01:06:21,480 --> 01:06:23,480
the fucking traveling Wilberries at this point.

1522
01:06:23,480 --> 01:06:26,000
Like it is such a giant normal family affair.

1523
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:28,280
And yeah.

1524
01:06:28,280 --> 01:06:31,000
Especially since both shows will be three shows in one.

1525
01:06:31,000 --> 01:06:31,840
Yeah.

1526
01:06:31,840 --> 01:06:33,680
It'll probably go a little bit later than normal.

1527
01:06:33,680 --> 01:06:35,400
And I just can't guarantee that we'll be able

1528
01:06:35,400 --> 01:06:37,520
to stick around for hours and hours afterwards.

1529
01:06:37,520 --> 01:06:39,240
We'll try to holler.

1530
01:06:39,240 --> 01:06:40,240
I don't want to poo poo it.

1531
01:06:40,240 --> 01:06:42,080
Do you guys want this final yahoo though?

1532
01:06:42,080 --> 01:06:42,920
Hell yeah.

1533
01:06:42,920 --> 01:06:45,240
Oh, I want to say one thing before we go.

1534
01:06:45,240 --> 01:06:46,800
Check out all the other Max Fun shows,

1535
01:06:46,800 --> 01:06:48,440
including a brand new show.

1536
01:06:48,440 --> 01:06:50,520
If you like the TV show, Adam Ruins Everything,

1537
01:06:50,520 --> 01:06:52,640
or the web series, Adam Ruins Everything,

1538
01:06:52,640 --> 01:06:55,600
Max Fun is now host to the Adam Ruins Everything podcast.

1539
01:06:55,600 --> 01:06:56,640
Oh, I didn't know that.

1540
01:06:56,640 --> 01:06:57,480
Yeah.

1541
01:06:57,480 --> 01:06:58,960
So basically they take, you know,

1542
01:06:58,960 --> 01:07:00,520
so for example, they did an episode

1543
01:07:00,520 --> 01:07:02,520
about like transit and cars.

1544
01:07:03,360 --> 01:07:06,160
So in that, Adam gets to talk to an expert

1545
01:07:06,160 --> 01:07:08,440
for like three minutes on the TV show.

1546
01:07:08,440 --> 01:07:10,000
Well, so for the podcast,

1547
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:11,840
he gets back in touch with that expert

1548
01:07:11,840 --> 01:07:14,240
and they talk about like transit for like an hour

1549
01:07:14,240 --> 01:07:16,840
so that he really gets to pick the brain of an expert

1550
01:07:16,840 --> 01:07:17,880
and it's on Max Fun.

1551
01:07:17,880 --> 01:07:19,520
So check it out.

1552
01:07:19,520 --> 01:07:20,360
That's very exciting.

1553
01:07:20,360 --> 01:07:21,360
All right, final yahoo.

1554
01:07:21,360 --> 01:07:22,760
This one was sent in by Erin Keys.

1555
01:07:22,760 --> 01:07:24,160
Thank you, Erin Keys.

1556
01:07:24,160 --> 01:07:27,080
It's by, seriously, start thinking about a nickname.

1557
01:07:27,080 --> 01:07:28,840
Getting a lot of Erin Keys action.

1558
01:07:28,840 --> 01:07:32,080
She, Erin Keys tweeted that she hated the term keister.

1559
01:07:32,080 --> 01:07:33,120
So that one's not going to stick.

1560
01:07:33,120 --> 01:07:33,960
Okay. That's out.

1561
01:07:33,960 --> 01:07:34,960

1562
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:38,240

01:07:38,240 --> 01:07:39,080
Great, great.

1564
01:07:39,080 --> 01:07:40,880
Keeper, Keysper.

1565
01:07:40,880 --> 01:07:42,720

1566
01:07:42,720 --> 01:07:44,120
Okay.

1569
01:07:47,280 --> 01:07:50,200
Yahoo Answers user Sweeney Todd asked this one.

1570
01:07:50,200 --> 01:07:54,080
Sweeney Todd asked, how creative is Kid Rock?

1571
01:07:59,760 --> 01:08:00,600
I'm Justin McElroy

1572

1576
01:08:10,160 --> 01:08:11,480
Fuck, fuck, fuck.

Kiss your dance ground lips.

1578
01:08:15,480 --> 01:08:35,480
