1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there will know how cool they are for listening.

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:23,000
What's up, you cool babies?

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Familiar, but not too familiar, but not too not familiar.

5
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:15,000
It's a new craze, hey good girls, do you want it? Just say, hey I wanna. Just say, hey I wanna.

6
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:32,000
John Rodger, John Rodger, John Rodger.

7
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Oh shit.

8
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:42,000
I'm going to be, I'm going to be, I'm going to be worthless this whole show after that.

9
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:49,000
John Rodger, one more time for John Rodger.

10
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:54,000
He was like, do you want me to play the whole song? And we're like, let's remember who's on the marquee.

11
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Hey, hey.

12
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Calm down.

13
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Seattle, are you ready for a psychosexual journey with us?

14
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
My name.

15
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,000
We're all going to come through the other end together.

16
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Yeah, we, yeah, this is my brother, my brother and me, it's an advice show for the modern era and I'm your oldest brother Justin McElroy.

17
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:31,000
I'm your middle is brother Travis McElroy.

18
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:40,000
And I'm your sweet baby brother Flop Sweat Magoo.

19
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:48,000
I apologize for my shininess, but you see, I'm fucking terrified.

20
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:53,000
This is great though because the lighting allows me to only see the first 10 people, which feels right.

21
00:02:53,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Yeah, it feels like an intimate coffee shop show. Super attractive, super duper attractive.

22
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Hey baby, I hear the blues are calling, toss salad and scrambled eggs.

23
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Now wait, now hold on.

24
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,000
We had a fucking screaming argument about that.

25
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,000
I mainly did that to irritate Griffin.

26
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Hold on, I want to jump in. Griffin's big argument against us referencing Frasier was, no, hold on, his problem was, oh, everyone does that.

27
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:35,000
And he was just now, he was afraid that he literally said every comic act that comes to the net.

28
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:39,000
I'm saying fucking U2 comes here and plays at Bugaboo.

29
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
What's the, what's the thing that they do?

30
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Bugaboo?

31
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
What's the thing that they do at the Bumber shoot?

32
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Is that here?

33
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,000
You two plays at Bumber shoot and they're like, all right, here we go.

34
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Uno, dos, tres, catorce.

35
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Hey baby, I hear the blues.

36
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Get it you fucks.

37
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
That was you guys.

38
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,000
You guys were Frasier.

39
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:07,000
This is a true story I heard that the dog from Frasier was notorious for killing cats at the studio.

40
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:13,000
There was a wrangler who had to stop him from killing cats on studio grounds.

41
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:17,000
I like to think if a dog reaches a certain level of celebrity, they can fucking kill as many cats as they want.

42
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Better question, why were there so many cats at that studio?

43
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Seemed like he was doing a service.

44
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
That dog had Alf's rider.

45
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Just like, I only need six cats.

46
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
What did you put?

47
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Nice.

48
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Nice.

49
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
So this is an advice show.

50
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Are there any people?

51
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
I'm just going to try to see.

52
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Are there any people, please raise your hands if they haven't listened to My Brother, My Brother and Me before?

53
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:43,000
And we'll try to hear the sounds of your fucking hands going up because we definitely can't see you.

54
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Yeah, I can see you.

55
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:48,000
I heard some armpits deploy.

56
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:54,000
This is, if you are familiar with Dear Abby, it's basically like that.

57
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
It's an advice show and that's.

58
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
With an irreverent twist.

59
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:04,000
With an irreverent, we bring our own twisted view, our own skewed perspective to every, anyway.

60
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,000
I have green eyes and stranger always compliment them.

61
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:10,000
They'll say something like, your eyes are so pretty.

62
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:14,000
And then they'll say, you must get that a lot.

63
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
I never know how to respond.

64
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Just saying, thank you or I do get that a lot.

65
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Sounds conceited.

66
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
How do I respond to these compliments?

67
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Do I compliment them back?

68
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
And that's from Gmail.

69
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Justin, I want to say first that I really enjoyed your wistful reading of, you have such nice eyes.

70
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Like the rest of the sentence is, my eyes are so bad.

71
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Would it kill you to shoot some of that our way from time to time?

72
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
We've known each other for a while now.

73
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:44,000
You haven't said word one about these peepers.

74
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Wait, look at me grooving?

75
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Dreamy.

76
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Thank you.

77
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Justin?

78
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:56,000
They're fine.

79
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
I'll just be here.

80
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
They're functional.

81
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Oh, sorry.

82
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Super good.

83
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Thank you.

84
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Are you here, green eyes person?

85
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
That's a lie.

86
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
That's a lie, isn't it?

87
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
That took way too long.

88
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Was that a pity woo?

89
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
I don't want them to be awkward.

90
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Somebody out there has green eyes and they're like, this is my moment.

91
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Did I get super drunk and right into an advice podcast?

92
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Was that me?

93
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Was that me?

94
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Can I just say, I personally love the move of going, thanks, I get that a lot.

95
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
That's a power move.

96
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
You have great eyes.

97
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,000
I know.

98
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:39,000
So do you at seeing my great eyes.

99
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:44,000
How observant of you to notice those must be fully functional peepers you got because

100
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:49,000
they have definitely observed the masterpiece that I have going on here between brow and

101
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
nose.

102
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:56,000
There's got to be like just a reusable phrase you can use for like, well, thanks.

103
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
I've been growing them.

104
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:00,000
No, here's the joke.

105
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:04,000
This is the joke that I use when I get any compliment, like nice hair, which I get a

106
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
lot.

107
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:09,000
This fucking whoa, we're not deep enough into this show.

108
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Sexy.

109
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Wow.

110
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
This is the response.

111
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Thanks.

112
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
I've been working out, but you have to say it like this.

113
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
I didn't say it right.

114
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Hold on.

115
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Let me do the delivery better.

116
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Hold on.

117
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
But like more natural than that.

118
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:28,000
You put a little Mike Myers stink face on it.

119
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,000
I know it's funny too.

120
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:35,000
And then by that time, hopefully the elevators opened and you can escape.

121
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Yeah, sure.

122
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Holy shit.

123
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Quick sidebar.

124
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Can we talk about that number one dude we met in the elevator last night?

125
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:47,000
We were on the first floor of our hotel last night in Portland and we're first floor and

126
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:52,000
we were going up some Portland people that came up to this show.

127
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:56,000
That's like 70% of the fucking audience.

128
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
No one actually lives in Seattle.

129
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
They just like apparently truck in.

130
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
I commute for my comedy podcast.

131
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
We're on the first floor.

132
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
We had just gotten back from the show last night.

133
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Super late.

134
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
We were all super tired.

135
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:12,000
The door opens up and we're going to the sixth floor and there's a dude just in it.

136
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
And we were like, hey, he's like, this is going down.

137
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:19,000
It was like, I assure you we're on the bottom of this building.

138
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
There's no more building.

139
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
So then the door closes.

140
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:25,000
The door closes because we're all very like passive people.

141
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
And then opens again.

142
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
It opens again.

143
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
He's like, oh, I guess it's going up now.

144
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Like, yeah, we fucking hacked it.

145
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Up, up, down, down, up, down, up.

146
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
And then you can change the direction of the elevator.

147
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
He did not say, I guess it's going up now.

148
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:41,000
He said it's going up now as if we ruined it.

149
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Like he was trying to play it off as, oh, no, no.

150
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
I did go downstairs.

151
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Made no mistake.

152
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:50,000
I took care of what I needed to take care of.

153
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
I did that downstairs and now I'm going up.

154
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
You lost track of time.

155
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:58,000
And then he got off the elevator.

156
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Where were you going?

157
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
What was in the basement for you, sir?

158
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,000
I've got a boiler I'm excited about.

159
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:06,000
There was a woman when Teresa and I got there and we got on the elevator to go to her room.

160
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:10,000
We got there in our bags and this woman, apropos like we press the button, it's silent.

161
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:15,000
She just turns to us and goes, consider this your Portland welcome.

162
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
And then turn back.

163
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,000
And then we got off the elevator and said, thanks.

164
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
I feel so welcome now.

165
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Do you remember what the dude's shirt said?

166
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Because that was the best part.

167
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Oh, yes.

168
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
Oh, it was professional sports?

169
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
It was professional championship.

170
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Professional championship.

171
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Two words.

172
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
She's like, cool.

173
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Okay, wait.

174
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Imagine in your mind a man in a shirt.

175
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Do you have it?

176
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
We'll give you a moment.

177
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Do you have it?

178
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Imagine his shirt has two words on it.

179
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:45,000
They are in this order, professional championship.

180
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Okay?

181
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
That's someone who's hedging their bets.

182
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
It's so kind of something.

183
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Because sports or business are both sports business.

184
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
I think we answered the question.

185
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Calculate off.

186
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
I think we helped as best we could.

187
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Yeah.

188
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:01,000
Does anybody here want a Yahoo answer?

189
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
Good.

190
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:07,000
If you're new to the show, sometimes people, I was going to say we'll get Yahoo answers

191
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
to the show, but that's just not true.

192
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
People get them for us.

193
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Like Rachel Sperling, game recognized game.

194
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Rachel Sperling, are you here?

195
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Yeah, it would be concerning if you weren't.

196
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:22,000
Because you told us you were going to be, yeah.

197
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Recognize the game.

198
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:27,000
This is Rachel's like seventh live show with us.

199
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:31,000
And she just knows to stand up and wave because we'll make her do it if she does.

200
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Recognize that game.

201
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
Griffin, what's the Yahoo?

202
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Just got a nice text from my wife.

203
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
What's it say?

204
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,000
No, don't worry about it.

205
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
Travis Stone, it's private.

206
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Rachel Sperling sent this in.

207
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Thank you.

208
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
There's a thousand people here.

209
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:51,000
It's by Yahoo answers user, Happy Equine, who asks.

210
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Yeah.

211
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
Yeah, we're doing that.

212
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:57,000
This is one of them.

213
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:05,000
Happy Equine asks, desensitization, balloons?

214
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,000
Go ahead.

215
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:09,000
Desensitization, balloons?

216
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:12,000
So, this is longer than our usual fare.

217
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
Buckle up.

218
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:16,000
So I wanted to start desensitizing my horse.

219
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:21,000
I brought out a bag of potentially scary things to see what we would need to work on throughout the next few weeks.

220
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
There was a shiny banner that he was great with.

221
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:28,000
I could cover his eyes and wrap it around him, toss it, run around with it so it flapped, etc.

222
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:31,000
Then I moved on to a large plastic flag.

223
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:40,000
He was pretty nervous, but after about 15 minutes, I was able to rub it on him, put it on his face, etc.

224
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,000
You need some more, Dennis.

225
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:45,000
By the end of the day, I was even riding with it, WTC.

226
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
What does that mean?

227
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,000
Wait, hold on, hold on, hold on.

228
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,000
One person.

229
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,000
Walk, chalk, cancer.

230
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
Holy fucking shit.

231
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:57,000
We got a couple of horse heads in the audience.

232
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:02,000
Well, they're probably not called horse heads.

233
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,000
Okay, wait.

234
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
Hang on after the show because I've got a lot of questions.

235
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:08,000
I've been talking a lot of horse bullshit for a while.

236
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:18,000
I need to know, is that so common a thing that you had to shorten it to save what?

237
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,000
That's, yeah.

238
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,000
You've got a lot.

239
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,000
Listen, you're a horse trainer.

240
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:24,000
WTC saves one syllable.

241
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,000
Yeah.

242
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,000
Okay.

243
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,000
We'll talk after the show.

244
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,000
Okay, listen.

245
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,000
We'll exchange business cards.

246
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,000
Yeah.

247
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,000
Mine says my brother, my brother, and me.

248
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,000
Right.

249
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,000
Okay, listen.

250
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:36,000
We know jack shit about horses, but we talk about them.

251
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:41,000
If you're a horse trainer, and I cannot imagine there are so many different levels that walk,

252
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:44,000
chalk, canter is just like, that's just step one.

253
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,000
That's like 5% of it.

254
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
What else is this horse doing?

255
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,000
I know horses.

256
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:51,000
They just don't bite you, and then they walk, chalk, canter.

257
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,000
That's it, right?

258
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,000
That's like the whole thing.

259
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
I almost said triage, but I know that's not it.

260
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,000
Dressage?

261
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,000
What the fuck?

262
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,000
There it is.

263
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,000
Okay, all right.

264
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
I knew it wasn't triage.

265
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
I want that on the record.

266
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:08,000
Horses are good at knowing who would die first in a horrible accident.

267
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,000
Will he survive?

268
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,000
Nay.

269
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,000
Nay.

270
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:20,000
Please finish the question.

271
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:24,000
Okay, this woman rubbed a fucking flag on a horse for a while.

272
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:28,000
A lot of this question is about rubbing flags on horses.

273
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
Then came the scary thing, balloons.

274
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
I was slowly introducing it to him.

275
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:35,000
My horse spooks mostly at sounds, so I was practicing with noises.

276
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:39,000
I would simply let out the air, and he went crazy.

277
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:42,000
After no improvement, which he had quickly had with the other objects,

278
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
I tried different sounds with the balloon.

279
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:48,000
Everyone made him so scared, just very scared, so I stopped,

280
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:51,000
not wanting to scare the bad gibbies out of him.

281
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
Sorry, I fucked that up.

282
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:57,000
Without wanting to scare the bad gibbies out of my poor boy.

283
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:01,000
Anyways, how can I get him used to these noises without terrifying him?

284
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:04,000
I will only do a little bit at a time so I don't overwhelm him,

285
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:07,000
but what are some of your ideas?

286
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:10,000
It does not sound like that is the case at all.

287
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
Yeah, it sounds like you put this horse through a gauntlet,

288
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
a day-long gauntlet of error.

289
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
You're a fucking Marquis de Sade of order.

290
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:19,000
What about these?

291
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
He's French.

292
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,000
Yeah, sure.

293
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
Most Marquis are.

294
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,000
I'd wager, maybe.

295
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,000
I don't know.

296
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,000
Anything.

297
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:30,000
How important is it that when you're training a horse,

298
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:34,000
how important is it that it be completely without fear?

299
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
Is that the ideal?

300
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:39,000
If you're on it, probably pretty important.

301
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,000
Super important.

302
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,000
That's what they're teaching.

303
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
They're not working on anything other than,

304
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:46,000
I want this horse to be the horse without fear.

305
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
No, I like this idea, though.

306
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
Like you got a horse.

307
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
That's good.

308
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,000
Pretty good.

309
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
You should keep doing that one for the rest of the day.

310
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,000
Nice.

311
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,000
Nice.

312
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:00,000
That was a peach of a joke.

313
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
In tandem.

314
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,000
Here's the thing.

315
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:09,000
I guess what's most confusing to me is this idea of a fixer-upper horse.

316
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
If you get the horse and it's not immediately good

317
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
at whatever you need it to be good at,

318
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:16,000
and you're like, but I'll desensitize it.

319
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
How about you just don't make that horse do that thing?

320
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
Like it's not good around balloons.

321
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
That's how the horses cross the bear.

322
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,000
Yeah.

323
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:27,000
When God made horses, he was like, these things are perfect.

324
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,000
I got to do at least one.

325
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,000
Hey, hey, come in here.

326
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,000
Check out this horse.

327
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,000
Check out this awesome thing I made.

328
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,000
Nailed it, right?

329
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,000
Yeah, it's pretty good, right?

330
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
All sinewy and perfect and perfect.

331
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,000
Super good.

332
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
This is my day.

333
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,000
This is really good.

334
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,000
I should make it like super afraid of one thing.

335
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
How about balloons?

336
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:45,000
They won't have to deal with it for, I don't know, like 3,000 years.

337
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
How long have horses been around?

338
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,000
200 years.

339
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,000
Trainers?

340
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:52,000
Oh, got you there.

341
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:55,000
Where are horses and balloons even interacting?

342
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:58,000
They're not allowed at Times Square during the ball drop.

343
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,000
Where they drop balloons?

344
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,000
Never mind.

345
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:04,000
Maybe like a cart that delivers balloons to someplace.

346
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:07,000
You show up to like a Flaming Lips concert with a horse,

347
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:10,000
they're like, nope, turn around.

348
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
Others are very upset.

349
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:15,000
No one was more excited about the invention of the automobile

350
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:18,000
than balloon salesmen.

351
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
Finally, a calm drive.

352
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
Finally, a way to get these from A to B

353
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:25,000
without it being a whole thing.

354
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:29,000
So many balloon salesmen died from going over cliffs

355
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,000
in runaway carts.

356
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
Slow down, Brutus.

357
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
I am actively labeled as the hipster

358
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:37,000
in any of the various friend groups that I have.

359
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000
My friends expect me to only appreciate bands

360
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,000
that they've never heard of.

361
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:44,000
While yes, I do have some obscure tastes.

362
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:51,000
I also have a pretty profound love for some modern pop artists.

363
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:58,000
When my friends or acquaintances hear me getting down

364
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
with the latest club banger,

365
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:03,000
they assume I'm listening to it ironically and mock me for it.

366
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:06,000
How do I convince my friends to stop throwing shade?

367
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:10,000
That's from subpar Seattle hipster, are you there?

368
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
Hey, word up.

369
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:16,000
I was hoping you'd be like, eh.

370
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:19,000
Can I give you some advice?

371
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:22,000
That's why you're here.

372
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:25,000
Stop using phrases.

373
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:28,000
Like modern pop artists?

374
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
Don't say that.

375
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
If you call it the latest club banger,

376
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:35,000
you are indeed listening to it ironically.

377
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
I don't know how to break it to you.

378
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:40,000
Here's a list of people who can use the term club banger

379
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
unironically.

380
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,000
Pitbull.

381
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,000
Holy shit!

382
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:50,000
Whoa!

383
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:54,000
Well, that's going to do it.

384
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:57,000
Travis, if you'd done that shit too, we could retire.

385
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,000
I'll do it now, we'll edit it in.

386
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:02,000
Pitbull.

387
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:05,000
The joke was that there wasn't another name after Pitbull.

388
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:08,000
That's it.

389
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:12,000
Even if Chingy was like, club banger, you're like, Chingy.

390
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,000
Chingy?

391
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,000
Stop it.

392
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
This is one of those problems where someone says,

393
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:19,000
hey, everyone thinks this about me, but they're wrong.

394
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:22,000
The problem, sorry to call you out,

395
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:27,000
but you're putting out something that makes everyone think that.

396
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:31,000
Maybe they know something, you don't.

397
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:35,000
Maybe you are listening to it ironically, so ironically,

398
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,000
even you don't know.

399
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
The deepest level of irony.

400
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:41,000
Yeah, you've crossed the Rubicon of irony.

401
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:44,000
Time to look in that deep, dark, truthful mirror and say,

402
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:47,000
do I really enjoy the new Carly Rae Jepsen album, Emotion?

403
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,000
Yeah, let's talk about Carly Rae Jepsen.

404
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,000
Indeed I do.

405
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
No, let's not.

406
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:55,000
I have heard that album straight through six times today.

407
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,000
We measured our J.

408
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
I asked Griffin, who was driving the whole way,

409
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:03,000
how far we were away when we were driving to Seattle today,

410
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:07,000
and he said, we're about one and a half Carly Rae Jepsen's emotions away,

411
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:12,000
because that's all we listened to the entire drive.

412
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:16,000
Our booking agent was backstage like, is that album really good,

413
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
or it's like people feel that way about me.

414
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,000
No, it was real good.

415
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:22,000
Making the most of the night, that was a good tune.

416
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:26,000
Run Away With Me is another really good Carly Rae Jepsen song.

417
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:29,000
Name one more really good Carly Rae Jepsen song.

418
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,000
Fucking Emotion, Favorite Color.

419
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:34,000
Yes, a bunch of favorite color fans out there.

420
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:37,000
I'm getting really sweaty again.

421
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,000
Yeah.

422
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
Do you guys want to Yahoo?

423
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:44,000
I feel like we didn't answer that question at all.

424
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,000
We didn't answer that question really.

425
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,000
Oh, man, but it's this question.

426
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,000
I'm very excited about it.

427
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,000
Okay.

428
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,000
Send in by Level9000.

429
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:57,000
Yeah, Drew Drew at Drew Davenport.

430
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:00,000
I'm so excited.

431
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,000
I read this one like a while ago.

432
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:05,000
I was like, no, we're saving this one for Seattle because they've earned it.

433
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:08,000
Because if anyone's going to get it, it's you freaks.

434
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:11,000
Seattle audiences are the best audiences in the world.

435
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,000
I've always heard that, Justin.

436
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,000
I've always heard that.

437
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,000
You know who told me that?

438
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:17,000
John Roderick.

439
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,000
Nobody rocks like Seattle.

440
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,000
Griffin, do you have a fucking question?

441
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,000
Please, we can't stall any longer.

442
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,000
Why were you on, please?

443
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:28,000
I've been a Yahoo diver for so long now that I know how the system works.

444
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:32,000
This person's name who asked this is anonymous, which means they're not anonymous.

445
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:35,000
They put anonymous into the name field.

446
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,000
It is anonymous, the group.

447
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,000
This is by the hacktivist group anonymous.

448
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:44,000
The hacktivist, the black hat hacktivist group anonymous asks,

449
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:51,000
if butterflies could speak for 24 hours, what do you think we could learn in those 24 hours?

450
00:20:51,000 --> 00:21:00,000
We must know.

451
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,000
It's the only way.

452
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,000
Snowden leaning over his computer.

453
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,000
Ah, shit.

454
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,000
What if butterflies...

455
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,000
Oh, no.

456
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,000
Oh, no.

457
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:16,000
What have I done?

458
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:19,000
I've been flying all day.

459
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:22,000
That's Amelie.

460
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,000
More or less.

461
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:27,000
Wait, no, I haven't said any fucking asses.

462
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:31,000
I've been visiting blossoms.

463
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:34,000
You know what I found inside your blossoms?

464
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:37,000
Secrets.

465
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,000
So Justin doesn't really...

466
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:44,000
I put the blossoms outside your house, Mr. President.

467
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:47,000
I've been out there with anonymous.

468
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:50,000
Fucking Snowden is Amelie.

469
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,000
Yeah, dude.

470
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:54,000
I just realized that.

471
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:57,000
I made Snowden small and shrunk him down the size of a butterfly.

472
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,000
He was Amelie.

473
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,000
He became Amelie, yeah.

474
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,000
That'd be a great movie.

475
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,000
You know...

476
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,000
Whoa.

477
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:08,000
Anyway, if butterflies could talk for 24 hours, what could we learn in those 24 hours?

478
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:16,000
Probably a lot of like B racial slurs.

479
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,000
Like ones we don't even know.

480
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,000
Like cool ones we're not even aware of.

481
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,000
All those honey butts.

482
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,000
Honey butts?

483
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,000
I didn't say they were nice or clever.

484
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:32,000
Can I just say that typically I don't use them, but racial slurs, typically not adorable.

485
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,000
This is from butterflies.

486
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,000
That's true.

487
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:36,000
Pollen suckers.

488
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,000
Is that good?

489
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,000
That's pretty good.

490
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,000
Well, butterflies pollinate, too, so that'd be...

491
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,000
Well, okay.

492
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:44,000
No one asked your opinion, fucking Bear Grylls.

493
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,000
Keep it to yourself.

494
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,000
Keep it to yourself, Jack Hanna.

495
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:52,000
Maybe butterflies should talk about how great it is to pollinate plants.

496
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,000
Oh, God.

497
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,000
I was all up in that daisy.

498
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:56,000
That daisy over there.

499
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,000
I got deep in her stamen.

500
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:01,000
Crush that stamen, that pistol.

501
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:04,000
Daisy's juicy.

502
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,000
God.

503
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,000
That's gross.

504
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:09,000
Those are bad two words.

505
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:12,000
I always like the assumption that if animals could talk, what would they say?

506
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:18,000
This idea of, like, they've got so much wisdom that I think most butterflies would just be going...

507
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:23,000
It's insane to think...

508
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:29,000
Okay, it's so human-centric to think that butterflies, could they talk?

509
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:32,000
Could really add anything to the human experience.

510
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:36,000
Like, they've probably got a lot of knowledge that's very specific to butterflies.

511
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:37,000
Oh, what's it all about?

512
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,000
Oh, man, I've been waiting to tell you.

513
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:46,000
Yeah, like, it's basically about I was a worm for a while, and then I squinched around,

514
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:50,000
and then my butt felt weird, and then I was in a coffin, and I was this.

515
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,000
I was like some soup in a coffin, I guess.

516
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,000
Yeah, some soup in a coffin, I don't know.

517
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,000
And I can't wait to see what's next.

518
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,000
What do I transform into next?

519
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,000
I don't know.

520
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:00,000
What's next for me?

521
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,000
I see big furry things walking around.

522
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,000
Really excited to try that out.

523
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:07,000
You big pink fucks, I would love to take a stab at one of you.

524
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:09,000
Whatever you tall people with glasses are.

525
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:11,000
That would be dope.

526
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:14,000
What if they only spoke Portuguese?

527
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,000
I have nothing for you, butterfly.

528
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:19,000
I do not speak Portuguese.

529
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:25,000
But it's that way, you got one day to get there, maybe catch a plane.

530
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:26,000
You can probably sneak onto a plane.

531
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,000
I'll take you in my bag.

532
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,000
Come with me.

533
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,000
I'll take it in my bag.

534
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,000
I'll fly to Portugal.

535
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,000
Be free.

536
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:34,000
Talk to you.

537
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:37,000
I bet butterflies.

538
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:38,000
I bet butterflies.

539
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:39,000
Now hold on.

540
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:46,000
I want to live in the world in which a butterfly is just stable in the air in Griffin's carry-on

541
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,000
for the entire flight.

542
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:52,000
Just going, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do.

543
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:53,000
Over there.

544
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:54,000
Portugal.

545
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,000
My home.

546
00:24:56,000 --> 00:25:02,000
While I was in your backpack, I caught some Pokemon for you.

547
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:07,000
Remind me to turn my street pass on when we go back up stage, because I bet, yeah, my

548
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:11,000
fucking 3DS will just melt.

549
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:15,000
I bet butterflies, after they've transformed, are just insufferable.

550
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:16,000
Yeah.

551
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,000
They just think their king should have fucked down, I bet.

552
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:19,000
Oh, yeah.

553
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:23,000
You realize I was a piece of shit worm like a day ago.

554
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:24,000
Listen, baby.

555
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:28,000
I remember what it was like just being a worm, scooting around without looking at me.

556
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,000
I'm up here zooming around, soaring with the clouds.

557
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:34,000
I've got stained glass wings and a proboscis.

558
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:38,000
Why is Robert Evans a butterfly?

559
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:43,000
I remember when my wings first unfurled, and I thought, are these wings small?

560
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:46,000
But then I thought, it's how you flap them.

561
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:50,000
I'll tell you who loves wings.

562
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,000
Miss Judy Garland.

563
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:53,000
She was such a big fan.

564
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:58,000
She loved Two Things Booze and these beautiful flappers behind me.

565
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:01,000
Kept looking for a project to do together, never could work it out.

566
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:04,000
I only lived for 24 hours.

567
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,000
Well, I think they lived for a long time.

568
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:07,000
Super busy.

569
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:08,000
Okay.

570
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:15,000
Boo, boo, boo, boo, boo, boo, boo, boo, boo, boo, boo, boo, boo, boo, boo, boo.

571
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:16,000
You did not prepare us for this.

572
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:20,000
I just looked over at your computer and it was zoomed in and terrifying.

573
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:21,000
Ladies and gentlemen, this just in.

574
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:26,000
It's a haunted doll watch.

575
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:27,000
Boo.

576
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:28,000
This is hot across the wire.

577
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,000
This is coming in fast.

578
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:32,000
I'm just trying to get these details together as I can.

579
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:36,000
I just want you people in the audience to know and people at home, I will be spending

580
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:40,000
the entire time Justin is talking, trying to figure out which celebrity this doll reminds

581
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,000
me of.

582
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:44,000
It's a powerful witch named Ava.

583
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:48,000
It's a spirit vessel, EMV, EMP, very active, very powerful.

584
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,000
EMV and EMP?

585
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:51,000
Both of them, Griffin.

586
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:53,000
Yes, I'm just trying to get the details together.

587
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:55,000
We've got a description here.

588
00:26:55,000 --> 00:27:00,000
Welcome, for your consideration, is a beautiful porcelain doll.

589
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:03,000
For the Academy Award for best spookiest doll goes to.

590
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:04,000
Best spookiest.

591
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:08,000
A spirit vessel and what an active spirit she is.

592
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,000
Ava is very independent.

593
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,000
She does things her own way.

594
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:15,000
Do not try to tie this haunted doll down.

595
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:22,000
She calls herself a wild woman, a witch, untamable as the wind.

596
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:30,000
This doll ghost, she inspires that aspect of our nature, reminding women to be strong.

597
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:31,000
Whoa!

598
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:32,000
To love ourselves.

599
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:33,000
No, that's fucking no, no, no, no, no.

600
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:34,000
That's fucking awesome.

601
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:35,000
That's awesome, right?

602
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:36,000
No, no, no.

603
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:39,000
Picture a woman looking at a haunted doll and going, you know what, you're right.

604
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:40,000
Yes.

605
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:41,000
Yes.

606
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:43,000
I've been waiting for the, yes.

607
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:44,000
You know how I write.

608
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:45,000
You know what it is?

609
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:47,000
It's like, who's your inspirations woman?

610
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:48,000
Sally Radegas?

611
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:49,000
Who's yours?

612
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:53,000
A doll that lives in my house.

613
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:55,000
I did figure out who this doll looks like to me, by the way.

614
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:56,000
Excellent.

615
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,000
I bet on pins and fucking needles.

616
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:59,000
It's Geena Davis in Beetlejuice.

617
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:00,000
Yeah.

618
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,000
Yeah, I could see that actually.

619
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:03,000
For sure.

620
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:06,000
Anyway, she inspires that aspect of our nature to love ourselves.

621
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:11,000
She will not tolerate misogyny or bigotry.

622
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:13,000
It's a fucking cool doll.

623
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:18,000
She is a fierce protector, a healer, and she will bless your home with strength and protection.

624
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:23,000
She says it's time for her to move on, to grace another home with her presence and her magic.

625
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:25,000
That's with a K.

626
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:29,000
Who am I to argue?

627
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:30,000
That's the best part.

628
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:33,000
I'd love for you to kick it here for a while, but if you say so.

629
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:35,000
Steve, it's time for me to move on.

630
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:37,000
I've got to go inspire some other lady.

631
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:38,000
You know what, you're right.

632
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:39,000
You're right.

633
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:40,000
Yeah.

634
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:41,000
Maybe she doesn't want to go.

635
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:43,000
You have to punch her in the face like in Harriet and Henderson's.

636
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:44,000
What?

637
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,000
You weren't down here.

638
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,000
She is a fierce protector, a healer, who will bless your home.

639
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,000
Okay, who might argue, but I will miss her terribly.

640
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:54,000
Are you the one she's looking for?

641
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:57,000
Okay, I will miss her terribly.

642
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:59,000
There is a buy it now price at $59.99.

643
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:01,000
This is all I'm saying.

644
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:03,000
Listen, the new Call of Duty is coming out in a couple months.

645
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:05,000
I'm a little low on cash.

646
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:07,000
I've got to make my peace with the market forces.

647
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:11,000
I would love to trade my feminist power totem.

648
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:17,000
This doll is also shot literally like it looks like they held a flashlight under her chin.

649
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:20,000
She's super great.

650
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:25,000
And they take these pictures that have this like weird gold band across the front.

651
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:26,000
Like maybe that's a spirit.

652
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:27,000
I don't know.

653
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:28,000
I don't know.

654
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,000
I just think that's $60 real bad.

655
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:36,000
I feel it is time to find new homes for some of the spirit vessels I've collected.

656
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:39,000
This is the greatest short story I've ever heard in my life.

657
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:43,000
I feel like I do not have enough time to devote to working with all of them.

658
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:47,000
And it isn't fair to just keep them on the shelf.

659
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:50,000
This, okay, this guy or girl.

660
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,000
Yeah, you're just assuming.

661
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,000
This person.

662
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:58,000
Maybe it's a doll too.

663
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,000
Inception 2.

664
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:06,000
But their calling is to work with these vessels and they just got in over their head.

665
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,000
I've just got too many.

666
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:09,000
They don't have the time.

667
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:11,000
I need to cut Ava.

668
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:13,000
Sorry, Ava.

669
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:18,000
Your first quarter performance is a little disappointing.

670
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:22,000
Yeah, I don't know why she is stuck on JV and has to get sold on eBay.

671
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:25,000
Feel free to ask any questions you have.

672
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:27,000
I can provide additional pictures if you would like.

673
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:31,000
I will be listing other dolls soon if you would like to look at them as well.

674
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:36,000
As per eBay guidelines, I must say that this is for entertainment purposes only.

675
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:37,000
Oh, God.

676
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:44,000
eBay, can you not fucking give us like a minute of fantasy from this shit ass world?

677
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:45,000
You know what?

678
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:48,000
Seriously though, fuck eBay.

679
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:56,000
No, but seriously, fuck eBay because do you know what it says about their perception of you?

680
00:30:56,000 --> 00:31:02,000
That they're like, listen, you have to clarify that you're not selling a literal ghost.

681
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:05,000
Like no fucking shit, eBay.

682
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:07,000
It's a ghost.

683
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:20,000
That's a crazy assumption for you to make because implicit in eBay's requirement for you to say this is for entertainment purposes only is a tacit endorsement of the existence of ghosts by eBay.

684
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:23,000
And not that your ability to buy and sell them.

685
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:24,000
Not even that.

686
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:28,000
That if ghosts do exist, they like to kick it in dolls.

687
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:31,000
They'll go where the doll goes.

688
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:32,000
Very easy.

689
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:33,000
I'm a ghost, okay?

690
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:34,000
When am I going to have it?

691
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,000
Wait, what?

692
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:37,000
I'm a ghost.

693
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:47,000
Am I going to have it like a stationary fake little human or like a bitch in Bugatti?

694
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:48,000
Wait, hold on.

695
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:52,000
We haven't checked haunted Bugatti watch.

696
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:53,000
Yeah, it's so sad Griffin died.

697
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:54,000
Yeah, it's pretty sad.

698
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,000
But he's inhabiting a Bugatti right now.

699
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,000
So he's actually pretty cool.

700
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:59,000
He's worth more now.

701
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:01,000
He's on the Pacific Coast Highway.

702
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:03,000
You can't catch him.

703
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:06,000
He's a very fast car now.

704
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:07,000
I believe it's time for audience.

705
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:11,000
That's what Tracy Chapman wrote that song about.

706
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:19,000
The song Fast Car, she had a friend, became a ghost, became a Bugatti in like 1980.

707
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:22,000
And we were driving, driving in my U.

708
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,000
I was in you, driving.

709
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:39,000
This is how fast car goes.

710
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:41,000
Good job, us in the past.

711
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:42,000
Good job, past us.

712
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:45,000
Boy, I wish present us were that good.

713
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:50,000
Feel a little off my game, traveling a little road hard and put down wet.

714
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,000
You know what'll help with that Griffin?

715
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:53,000
What's that?

716
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:57,000
It'll be Belgian waffles.

717
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:59,000
We should mention, Justin's not here.

718
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:02,000
We just got back from the tour that you're listening to now.

719
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:06,000
And it was a rough day of travel for most of us.

720
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,000
Yeah, a lot going on there.

721
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:11,000
A lot of slip ups, a lot of goof em ups.

722
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:14,000
We're home and in one piece, but that is why the episode is so late.

723
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:16,000
We're very sorry.

724
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:19,000
As long as we're busting out the bad news.

725
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:27,000
If you were really looking forward to hearing the energy that we could bring to a room in Portland.

726
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:29,000
Then, shitty news.

727
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:31,000
Because you won't.

728
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:33,000
That audio did not turn out great.

729
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:35,000
Didn't turn out great.

730
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:37,000
Well, two thirds of it did.

731
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:39,000
Two thirds of it turned out super good.

732
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:41,000
Somehow Travis's audio didn't come through at all.

733
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:45,000
Maybe we'll release that as like a really bad bonus episode.

734
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:47,000
Not for donors.

735
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:49,000
You deserve better than that.

736
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:57,000
But it's just like, hey, if you want to consume every bit of garbage and errata that we can put out there.

737
00:33:57,000 --> 00:34:03,000
Then here, enjoy an episode where it sounds like Justin and I are talking to each other.

738
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:05,000
And also a ghost.

739
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:09,000
Now Griffin, you know what will help if people are sad about not being able to hear the Portland show.

740
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:11,000
They should do what I do.

741
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:13,000
Eat mini Belgian waffles?

742
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:15,000
Eat your feelings away.

743
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:17,000
Then you want to go to naturebox.com.

744
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:19,000
Naturebox offers lots of snack choices.

745
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:21,000
Like the mini Belgian waffles that I mentioned earlier.

746
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:23,000
Strawberry lemonade fruit stars.

747
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:25,000
Sweet and salty nut medley.

748
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:27,000
The Asiago cheese crisps.

749
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:29,000
Which are in fact my favorite.

750
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:31,000
There's all kinds of stuff.

751
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:33,000
And it's full of flavor.

752
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:35,000
But you won't find any junk in that box.

753
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:37,000
No junk in that trunk.

754
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:39,000
You know what I mean?

755
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:41,000
No junk.

756
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:43,000
No podcast episodes where you can't hear one third of the hosts.

757
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:45,000
I thought I was over it.

758
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:47,000
But apparently not entirely over it.

759
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:49,000
I had forgotten about it until you mentioned it.

760
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:51,000
Cool day.

761
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:53,000
If you would like to enjoy your first box of Naturebox snacks for free.

762
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:57,000
You just have to go to naturebox.com slash my brother.

763
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:59,000
And you get to try a box of their favorite snacks.

764
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:01,000
And then you're going to fall in love with it.

765
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:03,000
And just start ordering it from them.

766
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:05,000
So go to naturebox.com slash my brother.

767
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:07,000
And make that happen.

768
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:09,000
And after you've fallen in love with Naturebox.

769
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:11,000
You're also going to fall asleep.

770
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:13,000
You're not going to wake up from having a big bear tummy full of food.

771
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:15,000
Time to hibernate.

772
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:17,000
And the best way to do that is on a mattress.

773
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:19,000
Yep.

774
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:21,000
That is historically the best way for humans to get sleep.

775
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:23,000
I've got a mattress recommendation for everyone.

776
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:25,000
And it's Casper.

777
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:27,000
Who just so happens is our sponsor this week.

778
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:29,000
I sleep on Casper.

779
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:31,000
It's amazing.

780
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:33,000
I got it in the mail.

781
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:35,000
It came in a relatively small box.

782
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:37,000
Then you open it up.

783
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:39,000
And like some kind of future tech.

784
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:41,000
It turned into a mattress.

785
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:43,000
It went from a weird rolled up plastic thing to a mattress.

786
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:45,000
It was amazing.

787
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:47,000
You put three drops of water on it.

788
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:49,000
You said a little wish.

789
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:51,000
A little prayer.

790
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:53,000
And then your energy.

791
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:55,000
It expanded it.

792
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:57,000
Anyway, I want to tell you about Casper.

793
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:59,000
You go online. You buy it. They send it to you.

794
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:01,000
Like Travis said.

795
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:03,000
It's real little. And then it gets big.

796
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:05,000
And then it gets really comfy.

797
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:07,000
If you're unsold on this whole concept.

798
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:09,000
It's free delivery and painless returns.

799
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:11,000
After 99 days you say, you know what?

800
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:13,000
No.

801
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:15,000
Casper was a ghost.

802
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:17,000
And I find that a little too spooky to include in the bedroom.

803
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:19,000
I've got to get rid of it.

804
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:21,000
You can do that. You have 100 days to decide.

805
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:23,000
Right now you can get $50 towards any mattress purchase.

806
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:25,000
Because you listen to our show.

807
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:27,000
Just go to Casper.com slash my brother.

808
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:29,000
And use the promo code my brother.

809
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:31,000
All one word at checkout.

810
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:33,000
Terms and conditions do apply on that.

811
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:35,000
Not sure what that means.

812
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:37,000
But I do know as a hell of a mattress man.

813
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:39,000
We also want to say a special message to Lucretia.

814
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:41,000
This is from Maurice.

815
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:43,000
Maurice says,

816
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:45,000
Happy birthday to my wonderful girlfriend Lucretia.

817
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:47,000
You are 100% the best thing that has happened to me.

818
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:49,000
I love you.

819
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:51,000
Also, having a name like Lucretia spawns a lot of nicknames.

820
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:53,000
So, since she loves when you guys goof on a list.

821
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:55,000
Here are some of her nicknames.

822
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:57,000
Cretia.

823
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:59,000
Krish.

824
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:01,000
Lucky.

825
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:03,000
Lulu.

826
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:05,000
Lucretia.

827
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:07,000
And The Sugar.

828
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:09,000
I'm not sure why the list continued after Luda.

829
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:11,000
Or why there was anything that preceded Luda.

830
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:13,000
Because it's not even accurate, right?

831
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:15,000
Her name is not Luderisha.

832
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:17,000
Her name is...

833
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:19,000
I like The Sugar.

834
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:21,000
Because it sounds like a deceptively sweet assassin.

835
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:23,000
Yeah.

836
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:25,000
Her name is also spelled L-U-C-R-E-T-I-Z.

837
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:27,000
And...

838
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:29,000
Her name is also spelled L-U-C-R-E-T-I-Z.

839
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:31,000
And...

840
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:33,000
Her name is also spelled L-U-C-R-E-T-I-Z.

841
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:35,000
And that's pronounced Lucretia.

842
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:37,000
Maurice has informed us.

843
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:39,000
I don't...

844
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:41,000
It seems like you can just sort of have your way with that though, right?

845
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:43,000
If that's my name.

846
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:45,000
If that's how I spell my name.

847
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:47,000
It's Lucretiz.

848
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:49,000
Oh, that's a really great, like, DJ name.

849
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:51,000
Hell yeah, it is.

850
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:53,000
You know what else is?

851
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:55,000
What?

852
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:57,000
Luda.

853
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:59,000
Got another message here that was sent in for Nazneen and Ian.

854
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:01,000
Or is that a lowercase L?

855
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:03,000
Maybe it's Lane.

856
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:05,000
Let's stick with Ian.

857
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:07,000
All right, Ian and Nazneen.

858
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:09,000
It's from Courtney and Kyle who say,

859
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:11,000
Congrats on your wedding, which we know we definitely had fun at.

860
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:13,000
You two are the greatest humans,

861
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:15,000
and what better way to tell you

862
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:17,000
than by letting the McElroy brothers do it for us.

863
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:19,000
The wedding was so great.

864
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:21,000
Yeah, I'm assuming they bought this message far in advance.

865
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:23,000
Which, by the way,

866
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:25,000
if you want to get up on our show and tag it,

867
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:27,000
then you gotta go to

868
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:29,000
jumbomfun.org forward slash jumbotron

869
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:31,000
and get your message in early.

870
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:33,000
Because we're booked up pretty

871
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:35,000
deep in advance, and

872
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:37,000
it's unfortunate, but that is

873
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:39,000
why Courtney and Kyle kind of had to roll the dice

874
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:41,000
on this one.

875
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:43,000
But happy wedding. I bet it was beautiful,

876
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:45,000
and I bet Courtney got a little too drunk.

877
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:47,000
Maybe, like, said some things

878
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:49,000
into the video camera.

879
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:51,000
No, no, no, no, no. Courtney locked it down.

880
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:53,000
Yeah? Do you think she started the dancing?

881
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:55,000
I think she started the dancing.

882
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:57,000
I think she was stone cold sober when she did it.

883
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:59,000
I think she was in full, like,

884
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:01,000
sound mind and body.

885
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:03,000
Just, like, got up there and nae nae'd all the night long.

886
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:05,000
Just nae nae'd

887
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:07,000
and whipped?

888
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:09,000
Nope. Nobody whips anymore.

889
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:11,000
Everybody just nae nae's, and she nae nae'd

890
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:13,000
all night long. Even during the slow songs.

891
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:15,000
Even during the father-daughter dance.

892
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:17,000
Excuse me, Courtney.

893
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:19,000
Could you just take a quick break?

894
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:21,000
Just a two minute? No? Okay, that's fine.

895
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:23,000
Put the breaks on it.

896
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:25,000
What other shit do we have to talk about?

897
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:27,000
Oh, big, big, big, big thanks to John Roderick.

898
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:29,000
John Roderick, you're the coolest dude ever

899
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:31,000
for doing our intro.

900
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:33,000
Just every week,

901
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:35,000
but also at the Seattle live show specifically.

902
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:37,000
That was a real treat for us.

903
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:39,000
We also want to remind everybody

904
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:41,000
that we have another live show coming up.

905
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:43,000
If you're listening to this and thinking,

906
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:45,000
oh, I wish I could have been there.

907
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:47,000
I wish I could see them live.

908
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:49,000
We're doing a live show for My Brother, My Brother, Me

909
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:51,000
and the Adventure Zone at LA PodFest.

910
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:53,000
You're probably listening to this and thinking,

911
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:55,000
but I'm nowhere near Los Angeles,

912
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:57,000
and I don't want to go to that dump city.

913
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:59,000
Well, that's mean.

914
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:01,000
It's very mean of you, but that's fine.

915
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:03,000
We love it.

916
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:05,000
I love LA.

917
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:07,000
If you go to LAPodFest.com

918
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:09,000
and click on live stream,

919
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:11,000
the thing is, we're going to be live streaming

920
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:13,000
all the shows from LAPodFest.

921
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:15,000
You can watch them live.

922
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:17,000
You can watch us do My Brother, My Brother, Me

923
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:19,000
and the Adventure Zone live from anywhere.

924
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:21,000
LAPodFest.com, click on live stream,

925
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:23,000
use the coupon code BROTHER or ZONE

926
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:25,000
and you can watch them along with all the other shows.

927
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:27,000
The greatest thing is this,

928
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:29,000
you don't even have to be at your computer

929
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:31,000
at the time when the shows happen.

930
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:33,000
They're going to archive it for a month.

931
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:35,000
You have 30 days to catch it.

932
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:37,000
It's a great deal.

933
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:39,000
Use the coupon code BROTHER and ZONE.

934
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:41,000
It saves you $5 and it helps support our show.

935
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:43,000
We love it.

936
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:47,000
Hi, I'm Lisa Hanawalt.

937
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:49,000
And I'm Emily Heller.

938
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:51,000
And if you're not listening to our podcast Baby Geniuses,

939
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:53,000
you're missing out on stuff like...

940
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:57,000
Who's like, would you ever go to a friend

941
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:59,000
and you're like, hey, could you

942
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:01,000
lick all these envelopes for me?

943
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:03,000
You'd be like, you're a serial killer.

944
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:05,000
Definitely, I'm leaving right now.

945
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:11,000
It was just a great moment of like,

946
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:13,000
oh no, I'm here, boys.

947
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:17,000
I'm on this side of the bench.

948
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:19,000
Just feel like they're always in character.

949
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:21,000
Like, they're always in character

950
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:23,000
as like, cool hipster girl.

951
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:25,000
And I just want to

952
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:27,000
break through that barrier.

953
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:29,000
Plus, every week we explore a new Wikipedia page

954
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:31,000
and talk to a crazy expert in the field of nonsense.

955
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:33,000
Well, any hack

956
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:35,000
can make you not have a boner.

957
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:37,000
I mean, it's about how you do it.

958
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:39,000
And we're the only podcast

959
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:41,000
with regular updates about Martha Stewart's pony

960
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:43,000
or your money back.

961
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:45,000
We're not going to give them their money back, are we?

962
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:47,000
No. Let's keep it.

963
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:49,000
Listen to our show every other Monday

964
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:51,000
on Maximum Fun.

965
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:53,000
Yay!

966
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:55,000
Should we throw it to the audience

967
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:57,000
for questions?

968
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:59,000
I believe we should.

969
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:01,000
So, from time to time in our live shows,

970
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:03,000
we throw it to the audience to get some questions

971
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:05,000
from you.

972
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:07,000
Can we get house lights?

973
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:09,000
There is one rule.

974
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:11,000
I don't know what that rule is.

975
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:13,000
No bummers!

976
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:15,000
That's correct. No bummers.

977
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:17,000
You can't all yell it at once.

978
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:19,000
Just you, horse trainer.

979
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:21,000
She doesn't know the rule. It's no bummers.

980
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:23,000
It's actually emblazoned.

981
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:25,000
If you forget, actually we have a helpful

982
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:27,000
mnemonic device.

983
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:29,000
Our friends at Ear Trumpet Labs in Portland

984
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:31,000
made us a microphone.

985
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:33,000
It's a Josephine model mic you can see before you.

986
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:35,000
It is emblazoned with the words

987
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:37,000
no bummers.

988
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:39,000
It's actually engraved on there

989
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:41,000
in case you forget.

990
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:45,000
Should we get a little bit more house?

991
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:47,000
Super duper can't see.

992
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:49,000
Who feels

993
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:51,000
that they have a great question

994
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:53,000
short,

995
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:55,000
fun, no bummers?

996
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:57,000
Breezy? Right here.

997
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:59,000
Right there.

998
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:01,000
Yes, you. Stand up.

999
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:03,000
Right there. Yes, you.

1000
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:05,000
Come on down.

1001
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:07,000
We pointed

1002
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:09,000
at somebody last night in Portland

1003
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:11,000
and three people started to walk down

1004
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:13,000
like no. We almost left the stage.

1005
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:15,000
You can do it. Oh shit, we didn't think

1006
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:17,000
about this. Just scooch. Scooch.

1007
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:19,000
These two kind people right here

1008
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:21,000
are going to let you pass. It's like a whole

1009
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:23,000
thing. Scooch.

1010
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:25,000
Perfect. Come on down to Josephine.

1011
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:27,000
Our mic. I'm not scooching.

1012
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:29,000
Okay. Hi. Hi.

1013
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:31,000
Hi. Yeah, go ahead and move that out. Yeah,

1014
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:33,000
it's good. I like your initiative. Thank you.

1015
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:35,000
What's your name? Summer.

1016
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:37,000
Hi, Summer. What's up? Well, I'm here.

1017
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:39,000
Is that good

1018
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:41,000
or bad? You said it ain't no bad.

1019
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:43,000
It's pretty good so far.

1020
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:45,000
Nice. Well, I like that you left

1021
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:47,000
the window open in case we tank at the end.

1022
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:49,000
So far, I don't

1023
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:51,000
want to say.

1024
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:53,000
Okay, so my question is I'm

1025
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:55,000
babysitting my dog up at college right now

1026
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:57,000
while my parents are moving.

1027
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:59,000
And I'm wondering... Your dog's

1028
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:01,000
just dog sitting.

1029
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:03,000
Dog sitting. Yeah, he's my family's dog.

1030
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:05,000
Cool. His name is Jack.

1031
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:07,000
That doesn't matter. It does to me.

1032
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:09,000
Hold on. We don't know what matters yet.

1033
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:11,000
You haven't finished the question.

1034
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:13,000
Your question could be what do you think of his

1035
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:15,000
name?

1036
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:17,000
So I'm wondering if I have

1037
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:19,000
like a guy over, is it okay

1038
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:21,000
to engage in

1039
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:23,000
intercourse in front of my dog? What?

1040
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:25,000
This is a family show.

1041
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:27,000
This is a family show.

1042
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:31,000
You know what I love about the summer, can I say?

1043
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:33,000
What I love about this

1044
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:35,000
is how much you

1045
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:37,000
narrowed it down to that one factor.

1046
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:39,000
Like it's a binary

1047
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:41,000
decision. The dog's there.

1048
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:43,000
Does that change things?

1049
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:45,000
It doesn't

1050
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:47,000
sound to me like it does.

1051
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:51,000
I feel like we need to know everything

1052
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:53,000
about this dog.

1053
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:55,000
Yeah, my first question is can this

1054
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:57,000
dog chill or what?

1055
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:59,000
He's chill. He's a German

1056
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:01,000
Shepherd.

1057
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:03,000
He's only four years old.

1058
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:05,000
Well, hold on.

1059
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:07,000
Hold on. Dog years, he's at least

1060
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:09,000
24, maybe 28.

1061
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:11,000
I think right now he's about 32.

1062
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:13,000
Oh man, if he doesn't know about this then.

1063
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:15,000
He's seen some shit.

1064
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:17,000
Please, Travis.

1065
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:19,000
Tell me the age at which it's cool

1066
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:21,000
for your dog to watch you fuck.

1067
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:23,000
Please tell me that

1068
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:25,000
number.

1069
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:29,000
Three.

1070
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:31,000
That sounds bad.

1071
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:33,000
That sounds so bad. There's not an age

1072
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:35,000
where it's like, oh, he's a 27

1073
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:37,000
year old? Then by all means

1074
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:39,000
have him watch or have sex.

1075
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:41,000
If he's old enough to drive away and go do

1076
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:43,000
something else.

1077
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:45,000
He's a dog. Can you explain? That's his

1078
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:47,000
fault. Yeah.

1079
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:49,000
Lot of variables.

1080
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:51,000
What's the layer? Is it a studio

1081
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:53,000
apartment?

1082
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:55,000
Does he have another room to go to if he doesn't

1083
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:57,000
feel comfortable? Yeah.

1084
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:59,000
I'm going to be in the basement

1085
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:01,000
summer. He's in the

1086
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:03,000
bedroom. Why?

1087
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:05,000
Close the damn door.

1088
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:07,000
Is this a fucking Frank Lloyd Wright

1089
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:09,000
house in which there are no walls and doors?

1090
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:11,000
Because if so, you have an issue.

1091
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:13,000
If not, simple solution.

1092
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:15,000
I think he's asleep.

1093
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:17,000
This is my new house.

1094
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:19,000
Summer.

1095
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:21,000
The issue you're asking is, is it okay

1096
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:23,000
if I like the fact that my dog watches me

1097
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:25,000
have sex? Yeah, that's the real question.

1098
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:31,000
Is there more house?

1099
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:33,000
Is he a

1100
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:35,000
raptor from Jurassic Park and he's figured out

1101
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:37,000
how to open doors?

1102
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:39,000
Is he smart? He's too damn smart.

1103
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:41,000
He's kind of dumb.

1104
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:43,000
Okay. Cool.

1105
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:45,000
Then put on cartoons in the living

1106
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:47,000
room. Let him have a great

1107
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:49,000
time. I just don't want to leave him

1108
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:51,000
unsupervised.

1109
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:53,000
That's fair, yeah. Because you're setting

1110
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:55,000
such a good example so far.

1111
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:57,000
Travis!

1112
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:59,000
Love it. Listen.

1113
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:01,000
Love making is...

1114
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:03,000
Or just fucking whatever it is.

1115
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:05,000
It's beautiful no matter what.

1116
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:07,000
Just some good old natural fucking.

1117
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:09,000
You know what? I say go

1118
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:11,000
for it. And then point

1119
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:13,000
at him and do this.

1120
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:15,000
No. Travis is now pointing

1121
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:17,000
at his eyes and pointing

1122
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:19,000
and I'm assuming what is

1123
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:21,000
the dog's eyes.

1124
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:23,000
Now, Travis, that is equally upsetting

1125
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:25,000
if you're saying, hey dog, I'm watching you

1126
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:27,000
or hey dog, watch this.

1127
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:29,000
That's a good one.

1128
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:31,000
Let me show you how it's done.

1129
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:33,000
Let me show you how it's done.

1130
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:35,000
I'm sorry Summer, but thank you so much for coming

1131
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:37,000
out. Thank you.

1132
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:39,000
Alright, let's see.

1133
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:41,000
Let's see.

1134
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:43,000
Who else has got a slam dunk question?

1135
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:45,000
Let's go right to it.

1136
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:47,000
You in the glasses.

1137
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:49,000
Yes, yes, with the yes.

1138
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:51,000
Yes.

1139
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:53,000
I see there that you're holding a poster.

1140
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:55,000
Or you were holding a poster.

1141
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:57,000
It's this poster here.

1142
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:59,000
I hope it's our poster.

1143
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:01,000
It was made by Emily Carroll and it's beautiful

1144
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:03,000
and amazing and it's my favorite thing ever.

1145
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:05,000
And it's affordably priced.

1146
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:07,000
Hey, what's up?

1147
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:09,000
What's your name?

1148
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:11,000
My name is Rosh.

1149
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:13,000
What's up?

1150
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:15,000
You know.

1151
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:17,000
Are you enjoying the show?

1152
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:19,000
You know it's rough?

1153
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:21,000
I do know, dude.

1154
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:23,000
The show is great.

1155
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:25,000
Top notch.

1156
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:27,000
Is it the best show you've ever seen?

1157
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:29,000
Shut up.

1158
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:31,000
Are we doing all shows?

1159
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:33,000
Podcasts?

1160
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:35,000
So I have an etiquette question.

1161
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:37,000
We're good at that.

1162
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:39,000
So I have this pet peeve when people say

1163
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:41,000
excuse me, but you're nowhere near them.

1164
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:43,000
You know what happens all the time?

1165
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:45,000
People are just like, oh, excuse me.

1166
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:47,000
You're standing outside the bathroom, but you're not in the way.

1167
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:49,000
And they're like, excuse me.

1168
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:51,000
And then they just walk by.

1169
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:53,000
And it's like, why the fuck did you say excuse me?

1170
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:55,000
I'm not even in your way.

1171
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:57,000
And I find it insinuating as if I'm just loitering outside.

1172
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:59,000
So do I say no?

1173
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:01,000
Or do I say yes?

1174
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:03,000
No, now, Rosh,

1175
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:05,000
can I tell you right now? I do that.

1176
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:07,000
And the reason is, excuse me,

1177
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:09,000
as a placeholder for this, I'm awkward

1178
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:11,000
just being around people.

1179
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:13,000
Just like, oh, I didn't think

1180
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:15,000
a human would be here. Excuse me.

1181
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:17,000
And all you have to say is, I get it.

1182
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:19,000
Yeah.

1183
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:21,000
There's a, I think,

1184
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:23,000
when this happens, those people are using

1185
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:25,000
excuse me

1186
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:27,000
in the Japanese style.

1187
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:29,000
Because the Japanese sumimasen

1188
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:31,000
could be used for

1189
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:33,000
literally anything.

1190
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:35,000
Excuse me. I'm sorry.

1191
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:37,000
Good morning. Happy birthday.

1192
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:39,000
Welcome home.

1193
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:41,000
Excuse me. Happy birthday. I'm sorry.

1194
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:43,000
It's a

1195
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:45,000
it's a power word.

1196
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:47,000
And I think that might just be how I

1197
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:49,000
It's a power word? Like a Fremen power word?

1198
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:51,000
Like a Tovahkiin

1199
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:53,000
shout.

1200
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:55,000
Should I say it back then to assert dominance?

1201
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:57,000
Excuse me.

1202
00:49:57,000 --> 00:49:59,000
No, excuse me.

1203
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:01,000
You are excused.

1204
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:05,000
I don't know.

1205
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:07,000
Is this the thing? Am I crazy?

1206
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:09,000
No, it definitely happens.

1207
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:11,000
Well, hold on. Two aren't mutually excusable.

1208
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:13,000
It is a thing.

1209
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:15,000
I don't know if you're crazy. We just met.

1210
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:17,000
Fair enough.

1211
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:19,000
Maybe just say excuse me

1212
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:21,000
longer than they did and louder.

1213
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:23,000
Just say excuse me right back.

1214
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:25,000
Excuse me.

1215
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:27,000
What if you just said okay.

1216
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:29,000
Excuse me.

1217
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:31,000
Silence.

1218
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:33,000
No, Rosh. Silence.

1219
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:35,000
Let it hang there.

1220
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:37,000
Let them take the next step.

1221
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:39,000
What's their follow up play?

1222
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:41,000
What else they got in the tank?

1223
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:43,000
Excuse me. I beg of you.

1224
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:45,000
Please.

1225
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:47,000
I need this.

1226
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:49,000
I can't die until you excuse me.

1227
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:51,000
I've been trapped in this loop for a hundred years.

1228
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:53,000
Please, my spirit, Rosh.

1229
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:55,000
Excuse me.

1230
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:57,000
Excuse me.

1231
00:50:57,000 --> 00:50:59,000
Does that answer your question?

1232
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:01,000
Perfect.

1233
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:03,000
I hope I could help.

1234
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:07,000
You.

1235
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:09,000
Yeah.

1236
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:11,000
Hey, what's up?

1237
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:13,000
I'm going to regret this.

1238
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:15,000
Oh, cool.

1239
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:17,000
What a start.

1240
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:19,000
Sounds like we might also.

1241
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:21,000
Proposal.

1242
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:23,000
What's your name?

1243
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:25,000
Casey.

1244
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:27,000
Casey, you know the rule, right?

1245
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:29,000
It's like on the mic.

1246
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:31,000
It is.

1247
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:33,000
And that's going to fit your question, right?

1248
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:35,000
Yes.

1249
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:37,000
It's happened a couple times.

1250
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:39,000
Okay.

1251
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:41,000
I've classically conditioned myself

1252
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:43,000
to have to go to the bathroom at certain locations.

1253
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:45,000
Nice.

1254
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:47,000
For example, I was hired at a new job

1255
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:49,000
every day for six months since then.

1256
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:51,000
I had to go to the bathroom when I entered

1257
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:53,000
because I smelled it and I had to go to the bathroom.

1258
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:55,000
What?

1259
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:57,000
That's why human bodies work?

1260
00:51:57,000 --> 00:51:59,000
It happened at Target and it happened at the library

1261
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:01,000
at my university.

1262
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:03,000
How can I not do this?

1263
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:05,000
Let me understand this.

1264
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:07,000
Your sense memory.

1265
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:09,000
I told you I would regret this.

1266
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:11,000
Your sense memory

1267
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:13,000
of Target

1268
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:15,000
is so powerful

1269
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:17,000
that when you walk into Target,

1270
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:19,000
your body must shit.

1271
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:21,000
Number two.

1272
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:23,000
You see that commercial

1273
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:25,000
with the weird old lady and the Jack Russell Terry

1274
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:27,000
and you're like, excuse me.

1275
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:29,000
I'm afraid I must excuse.

1276
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:31,000
I must wait to the loo.

1277
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:33,000
I told you I would regret this.

1278
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:35,000
You see people shooting arrows

1279
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:37,000
at Targets and you're like,

1280
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:39,000
pardon me for a moment, if you will.

1281
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:41,000
If that were a toilet.

1282
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:43,000
You said Target work

1283
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:45,000
at the library.

1284
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:47,000
Is that an Isaac Mizrahi?

1285
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:49,000
Excuse me for a moment.

1286
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:53,000
I will be back in exactly 37 seconds.

1287
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:55,000
How can I not?

1288
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:57,000
You said you were conditioned.

1289
00:52:57,000 --> 00:52:59,000
No, I'm sorry. It's going to be one of those questions.

1290
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:01,000
You said you were conditioned.

1291
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:03,000
It seems like classic conditioning.

1292
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:05,000
Were you given a candy every time you left the bat?

1293
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:07,000
Good job, Casey.

1294
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:09,000
I don't know.

1295
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:11,000
Open your mouth.

1296
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:13,000
Did you get yourself to an icy at the Target Cafe?

1297
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:15,000
It was probably

1298
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:17,000
popcorn and a hot dog. Let's be real.

1299
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:19,000
Wait, you say a hug or hot dog?

1300
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:21,000
Hot dog.

1301
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:23,000
Okay, much different than what I thought was happening.

1302
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:25,000
Casey, there's only one way.

1303
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:27,000
You got to eventually just once go to Target

1304
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:29,000
and not shoot a duke.

1305
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:33,000
Psychologically, shoot a duke at Target

1306
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:35,000
and then punish yourself.

1307
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:37,000
You start to associate it as a negative.

1308
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:39,000
You shoot a duke and then go like,

1309
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:41,000
Bad Casey.

1310
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:43,000
Can I just stop?

1311
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:45,000
Shoot yourself with a spray bottle.

1312
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:47,000
I want to stop the world real quick because

1313
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:49,000
take a shit at a Target and then punish yourself

1314
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:51,000
is definitely the craziest

1315
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:53,000
advice we've ever given anyone.

1316
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:57,000
100.

1317
00:53:57,000 --> 00:53:59,000
This is what, like 268?

1318
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:01,000
Yeah, we broke the world.

1319
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:03,000
Definitely.

1320
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:05,000
Go shit at a Target

1321
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:07,000
and then hurt yourself

1322
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:09,000
100% the craziest

1323
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:11,000
thing anyone's ever told anyone to do.

1324
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:13,000
I'm going to need to trade you advice

1325
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:15,000
for a poster.

1326
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:17,000
51 shades of gray

1327
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:19,000
go shit at that Target

1328
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:21,000
and then hurt yourself.

1329
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:23,000
Are you

1330
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:25,000
going to be there? Nope.

1331
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:29,000
Just chain yourself to a wall

1332
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:31,000
as soon as you walk in Target.

1333
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:33,000
I can't be trusted.

1334
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:35,000
You take this key no matter how much I beg.

1335
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:37,000
You to please let me shit

1336
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:39,000
your toes, but no matter

1337
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:41,000
what I say, I'm going to be a wild animal

1338
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:43,000
and I'm going to try to trick you with manipulation.

1339
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:45,000
You can't listen to me.

1340
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:47,000
Just please don't let me use the bathroom.

1341
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:49,000
Oh, by the way, you have to leave here overnight.

1342
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:51,000
Could you put

1343
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:53,000
Harry Potter on all the screens or something?

1344
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:55,000
The whole series,

1345
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:57,000
please. I can't just have two hours

1346
00:54:57,000 --> 00:54:59,000
of entertainment.

1347
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:01,000
Are you doing okay?

1348
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:03,000
We've been going

1349
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:05,000
all the hog up here.

1350
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:07,000
Just tell me we helped.

1351
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:09,000
Thank you.

1352
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:11,000
Let's get one more.

1353
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:13,000
Casey, your question made me lightheaded.

1354
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:15,000
It was so good.

1355
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:17,000
I already picked one.

1356
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:19,000
All right.

1357
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:21,000
Let's go back on the left.

1358
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:23,000
You shaking your hand the most vigorously.

1359
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:25,000
Nope. To the right. To the right.

1360
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:27,000
You're not going to stand up.

1361
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:29,000
It's the guy standing up then.

1362
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:31,000
No.

1363
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:33,000
While the shape in the back

1364
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:35,000
makes their way down, we'll do your question.

1365
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:37,000
Keep coming up.

1366
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:39,000
We can knock yours out in 10 seconds.

1367
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:41,000
This is going to be an easy one.

1368
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:43,000
I feel it.

1369
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:45,000
Go and go.

1370
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:47,000
What's your name? My name is Noah.

1371
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:49,000
Noah?

1372
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:51,000
You better hurry, Noah.

1373
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:53,000
He's coming.

1374
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:55,000
Here comes the wind to go.

1375
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:57,000
Just wait.

1376
00:55:57,000 --> 00:55:59,000
Walk super slow. Noah, hit me.

1377
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:01,000
Last year, my wife and I had our first child.

1378
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:03,000
This doesn't feel like it's going to be a breezy one.

1379
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:05,000
No, it's going to take forever.

1380
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:07,000
I love her to pieces.

1381
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:09,000
She's smart. She's cute.

1382
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:11,000
The child.

1383
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:13,000
My wife also, but yes, my child.

1384
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:15,000
We're talking about a second kid.

1385
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:17,000
Honestly, I'm concerned that my first one

1386
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:19,000
is my absolute favorite.

1387
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:21,000
I will never love anybody more than her.

1388
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:23,000
Is it worth it to

1389
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:25,000
one and done, we get a score, hold on one,

1390
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:27,000
or go for the second and see if we can...

1391
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:29,000
Hey, future Noah,

1392
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:31,000
you're listening to this episode with your kids,

1393
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:33,000
who are now seven and five.

1394
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:39,000
Maybe turn it off 30 seconds ago.

1395
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:41,000
Yeah, Noah,

1396
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:43,000
if you were wondering whether or not

1397
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:45,000
you can have a second kid, you have just

1398
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:47,000
sealed that deal for yourself, and the answer is

1399
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:49,000
no, you can't, because we will put this

1400
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:51,000
on the internet and they will hear it.

1401
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:53,000
And the internet is forever.

1402
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:55,000
The internet is forever, we hope.

1403
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:57,000
Is that all there, kid? Yeah.

1404
00:56:57,000 --> 00:56:59,000
Yeah, I'm sure you will.

1405
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:01,000
Listen, I'm no scientist, but yeah.

1406
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:03,000
The chances of you going, you're not as good

1407
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:05,000
as whatever first baby's name is,

1408
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:07,000
hopefully you know what it is, but

1409
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:09,000
you're not going to do that,

1410
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:11,000
maybe in your dark times,

1411
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:13,000
maybe in your quiet times,

1412
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:15,000
but you're not going to do it actively all the time.

1413
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:17,000
Just go for it?

1414
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:19,000
Yeah, dude, go for it.

1415
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:21,000
Have that baby.

1416
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:23,000
That is the second time

1417
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:25,000
we've done a live show, we have created

1418
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:27,000
a human being by giving somebody

1419
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:29,000
permission to have a child. Hey, what is up?

1420
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:31,000
Am I good?

1421
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:33,000
Because that guy's question was for real.

1422
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:35,000
Well, how good is your question?

1423
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:37,000
I love my two kids

1424
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:39,000
so, so much.

1425
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:43,000
I hate the third.

1426
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:45,000
The fourth is okay, but fuck the fifth.

1427
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:47,000
But the sixth one though?

1428
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:49,000
Anyway, what's up? What's your name?

1429
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:51,000
My name is Sam. Hi, Sam.

1430
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:53,000
My question cannot possibly compare.

1431
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:55,000
Yeah, great. Probably.

1432
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:57,000
Mine is probably one of the more Seattle questions.

1433
00:57:57,000 --> 00:57:59,000
Cool beans. You've come to the right place.

1434
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:01,000
Hello, Seattle!

1435
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:03,000
Yeah! Scramble bags!

1436
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:05,000
All over my face.

1437
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:07,000
So, recently

1438
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:09,000
I have moved into a home

1439
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:11,000
where I am living with my brother-in-law.

1440
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:13,000
Cool, cool.

1441
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:15,000
And this guy has the hook up to some dank

1442
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:17,000
kush.

1443
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:19,000
Oh, cool, cool, cool!

1444
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:21,000
Now that is marijuana?

1445
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:23,000
Right. Yeah.

1446
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:25,000
So, here's the thing. I'm a man of loyalty.

1447
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:27,000
Cool. Okay.

1448
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:29,000
For four or five years or so, I've been going to the same guy.

1449
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:31,000
What's his name?

1450
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:35,000
We're good. We're good here.

1451
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:37,000
What's his name?

1452
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:39,000
Let's just call him Weed Josh.

1453
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:41,000
I'm a cop.

1454
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:43,000
That's all I needed.

1455
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:45,000
Best weed name ever. Go ahead.

1456
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:47,000
We got him.

1457
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:49,000
Kicking Weed Josh's door.

1458
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:51,000
Kicking Weed Josh's door.

1459
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:53,000
And what would you say are your greatest strengths, Weed Josh?

1460
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:55,000
Low prices.

1461
00:58:57,000 --> 00:58:59,000
You're hired!

1462
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:03,000
I like how comfortable you're getting with that microphone, Sam.

1463
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:05,000
I'm making myself a home.

1464
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:07,000
You're making love to it.

1465
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:09,000
If your question is

1466
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:11,000
I have too much access to weed,

1467
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:13,000
I'm going to John Cena dive off

1468
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:17,000
this stage and tackle you.

1469
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:19,000
I can't imagine

1470
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:21,000
what a cross that is to bear.

1471
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:23,000
Get the John Cena music ready

1472
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:25,000
because we might need it.

1473
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:27,000
But what's your question for real, though?

1474
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:29,000
So, I guess for real, it's like

1475
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:31,000
how do I let Weed Josh know, like

1476
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:33,000
I don't need his dank.

1477
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:35,000
I don't need to drive fifty miles to get it.

1478
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:37,000
Is it the distance?

1479
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:39,000
That's a big factor.

1480
00:59:39,000 --> 00:59:41,000
That fools fifty miles from you?

1481
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:43,000
I played baseball with this guy.

1482
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:45,000
We grew up together.

1483
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:47,000
He gives me the deals, but

1484
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:49,000
But you have to drive to fucking Olympia to get your

1485
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:51,000
Is your worry,

1486
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:53,000
Sam, is your worry that Weed Josh

1487
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:55,000
will see you smoking and go,

1488
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:57,000
but I haven't seen him in three...

1489
00:59:57,000 --> 00:59:59,000
Hey.

1490
00:59:59,000 --> 01:00:01,000
That's not my purple

1491
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:03,000
strain of sticky.

1492
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:05,000
I thought we were bugs.

1493
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:09,000
Weed Josh is

1494
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:11,000
very clever.

1495
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:13,000
Weed Josh sounds awesome.

1496
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:15,000
Weed Josh is on his shit.

1497
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:17,000
Let me ask you a question.

1498
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:19,000
Is Weed Josh like a real friend?

1499
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:21,000
You know, we've been around.

1500
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:23,000
No, he's not.

1501
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:25,000
He's not going to be like one of my like

1502
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:27,000
groomsmen or something.

1503
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:29,000
Not with that attitude.

1504
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:31,000
How did you meet

1505
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:33,000
Joshua? Well,

1506
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:35,000
you know how high I am

1507
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:37,000
right now.

1508
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:39,000
It's because of that. He did that for me.

1509
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:41,000
I, um...

1510
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:43,000
Okay.

1511
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:45,000
Earlier in the show,

1512
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:47,000
we told a lady to shit at a target

1513
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:49,000
and beat herself.

1514
01:00:49,000 --> 01:00:51,000
Now, keeping that in mind,

1515
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:53,000
you saying

1516
01:00:53,000 --> 01:00:55,000
that someone who sells drugs

1517
01:00:55,000 --> 01:00:57,000
is going to have a hard time finding

1518
01:00:57,000 --> 01:00:59,000
other people to buy drugs

1519
01:00:59,000 --> 01:01:01,000
is the craziest thing I've ever

1520
01:01:01,000 --> 01:01:03,000
heard on this show.

1521
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:05,000
To be fair... What am I going to do with

1522
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:07,000
all these? But I got all these

1523
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:09,000
extra drugs lying around.

1524
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:11,000
They're just going to

1525
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:13,000
spoil. They're going to go rotten.

1526
01:01:13,000 --> 01:01:15,000
Had to throw

1527
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:17,000
them out.

1528
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:19,000
Am I too nice? Yeah, bro.

1529
01:01:19,000 --> 01:01:21,000
You smoke that much weed? Like, what's going

1530
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:23,000
on? Is it the dankness or is it the distance

1531
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:25,000
that's really throwing you off? Wait a minute.

1532
01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:27,000
What if I have a solution?

1533
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:29,000
I fix this for you. Smoke twice

1534
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:31,000
as much weed.

1535
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:33,000
Oh, hey.

1536
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:35,000
Thank you, Sam. Yeah, we crushed it.

1537
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:39,000
Hey, listen. Seattle, you've been

1538
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:41,000
super-duper nice to us. Thank you so much.

1539
01:01:41,000 --> 01:01:43,000
Yeah, this has been a fucking good show. Thank you very much.

1540
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:45,000
I'm not scared anymore.

1541
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:47,000
Can I also just say... I'm not

1542
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:49,000
scared anymore.

1543
01:01:49,000 --> 01:01:51,000
People at the back,

1544
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:53,000
at the very back of the top of the

1545
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:55,000
balcony, I think I love you most of all.

1546
01:01:59,000 --> 01:02:01,000
We want

1547
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:03,000
to say a huge thanks to the Moore

1548
01:02:03,000 --> 01:02:05,000
Theater. It's been super nice being here.

1549
01:02:05,000 --> 01:02:07,000
Yeah, super, super cool. Peter's amazing.

1550
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:09,000
Definitely, definitely haunted.

1551
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:11,000
They got us some really good seafood, and it was delicious.

1552
01:02:11,000 --> 01:02:13,000
Thank you to Billions, which is our

1553
01:02:13,000 --> 01:02:15,000
booking company. They put this together for us. Our guide

1554
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:17,000
Josh is here. He drove

1555
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:19,000
all the way. We literally

1556
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:21,000
would not be here if it weren't for Josh.

1557
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:23,000
We wouldn't be a lot of places.

1558
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:25,000
Thank you to Ear Trumpet Labs that made

1559
01:02:25,000 --> 01:02:27,000
our Josephine model microphone down

1560
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:29,000
there. The No Bummer special.

1561
01:02:29,000 --> 01:02:31,000
Big thanks to Saw Bones

1562
01:02:31,000 --> 01:02:33,000
for getting things started real right.

1563
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:39,000
I don't know that we've ever mentioned

1564
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:41,000
it before, but John Roderick does our

1565
01:02:41,000 --> 01:02:43,000
theme song.

1566
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:45,000
Too true,

1567
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:47,000
Travis. Too true.

1568
01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:49,000
We really appreciate him and

1569
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:51,000
the long wind. We've got posters

1570
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:53,000
by Emily Carroll. They're special for

1571
01:02:53,000 --> 01:02:55,000
this tour. They're gorgeous.

1572
01:02:55,000 --> 01:02:57,000
They're out in the lobby. They're 10 bucks.

1573
01:02:57,000 --> 01:02:59,000
This one. It's really pretty.

1574
01:02:59,000 --> 01:03:01,000
Her signature's actually in the smoke.

1575
01:03:01,000 --> 01:03:03,000
It's a detail you may have missed.

1576
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:05,000
That's our seasonal.

1577
01:03:05,000 --> 01:03:07,000
We're a member of the Maximum Fun Podcast Network

1578
01:03:07,000 --> 01:03:09,000
without whom none of this

1579
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:11,000
would ever have happened to us. We're super thankful to them.

1580
01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:13,000
Maximumfun.org

1581
01:03:13,000 --> 01:03:15,000
is the place to find the best podcasts in the world.

1582
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:17,000
Finally, I want to say a big

1583
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:19,000
thank you, and you may not have seen this coming,

1584
01:03:19,000 --> 01:03:21,000
to you.

1585
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:23,000
You've been

1586
01:03:23,000 --> 01:03:25,000
so nice to us.

1587
01:03:25,000 --> 01:03:27,000
I think that's it. Thank you to everybody who came out

1588
01:03:27,000 --> 01:03:29,000
to the Pacific Northwest shows.

1589
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:31,000
Is Vancouver the Pacific Northwest?

1590
01:03:31,000 --> 01:03:33,000
It's not. They call it Pacific Southwest.

1591
01:03:33,000 --> 01:03:35,000
Do they really? They do.

1592
01:03:35,000 --> 01:03:37,000
We want to say thanks again

1593
01:03:37,000 --> 01:03:39,000
to NatureBox, where you can order

1594
01:03:39,000 --> 01:03:41,000

1595
01:03:41,000 --> 01:03:43,000
You can go to naturebox.com slash my brother to sign up

1596
01:03:43,000 --> 01:03:45,000

1597
01:03:45,000 --> 01:03:47,000
snacks. We also want to say thank you

1598
01:03:47,000 --> 01:03:49,000
to Ear Trumpet Labs.

1599
01:03:49,000 --> 01:03:51,000
They provided some really

1600
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:53,000
amazing microphones for the tour,

1601
01:03:53,000 --> 01:03:55,000
including a beautiful...

1602
01:03:55,000 --> 01:03:57,000
We talk about it in the show, but a beautiful

1603
01:03:57,000 --> 01:03:59,000
audience mic that is emblazoned

1604
01:03:59,000 --> 01:04:01,000
with the words, no bummers.

1605
01:04:01,000 --> 01:04:03,000
We really, really appreciate it, and we wanted

1606
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:05,000
to say thank you. Yeah, thank y'all.

1607
01:04:05,000 --> 01:04:07,000
I think that's it. Let's throw it back to

1608
01:04:07,000 --> 01:04:09,000
us to wrap shit up.

1609
01:04:09,000 --> 01:04:11,000
Next week will probably be a regular

1610
01:04:11,000 --> 01:04:13,000
episode, I imagine. We'll save the Vancouver

1611
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:15,000
show for when we're traveling to

1612
01:04:15,000 --> 01:04:17,000
LA, I guess.

1613
01:04:17,000 --> 01:04:19,000
We'll talk to y'all soon.

1614
01:04:19,000 --> 01:04:21,000
I think Griffin has

1615
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:23,000
one more Yahoo that we're going to think about

1616
01:04:23,000 --> 01:04:25,000
and answer next week. Shit.

1617
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:27,000
What do you got for us?

1618
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:29,000
...

1619
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:31,000
It's by Yahoo

1620
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:33,000
answers user, Delta.

1621
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:35,000
Who has a zero percent score?

1622
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:37,000
No best answers. He's trying

1623
01:04:37,000 --> 01:04:39,000
his best.

1624
01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:41,000
He's new. He only started

1625
01:04:41,000 --> 01:04:43,000
June 15th. I got this.

1626
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:45,000
No hits so far,

1627
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:47,000
Delta. Going

1628
01:04:47,000 --> 01:04:49,000
a little long talking about

1629
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:51,000
Delta.

1630
01:04:51,000 --> 01:04:53,000
Delta asks,

1631
01:04:53,000 --> 01:04:55,000
I like space

1632
01:04:55,000 --> 01:04:57,000
and dinosaurs?

1633
01:04:57,000 --> 01:04:59,000
My name is Justin McElroy.

1634
01:04:59,000 --> 01:05:01,000
I'm Travis McElroy. I'm Griffin McElroy.

1635
01:05:01,000 --> 01:05:03,000
This has been my brother and brother. Make kids are damn

1636
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:05,000
square on the left.

1637
01:05:05,000 --> 01:05:31,000
...
