00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:30,800
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:49,360
Hello everybody and welcome to my brother my brother mean advice show for the modern era.

6
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:58,480
I'm your oldest brother Justin big points McElroy and I'm Travis high score McElroy.

7
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,720
Hold on guys. I've almost got I've almost got the high score. I need to shoot like two more

8
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:12,640
space men. One second has Griffin. I did it. I want it. I want the tiger handheld game that

9
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:19,040
I've been playing because it's E3. We're at it folks. E3 is off and popping. I'm sure you saw

10
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:25,200
a lot of the big announcements later today. That tense got away from me, but you know,

11
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:34,240
video games are here to stay and I love them in a major way. Rap I'm working on about.

12
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:41,200
I love them more than I love them more than anything. All day gaming all day. I dream about

13
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:50,400
us gaming soccer video games soccer video games. What guys guys? What do you think has been the

14
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:57,200
biggest bombshell of this year's E3 that is definitely happening now and not several days

15
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:02,960
in the future and not us recording on the Wednesday before? Yeah, it's a good question

16
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:09,600
and one that made a lot of sense coming out of the of the mouth. I'm for me. I mean during

17
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:13,680
the Sony press conference crash Bandicoot's weird shorts fell down and we saw his big fuzzy balls.

18
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:20,160
Wait and that was your biggest E3 like reveal. Do you think that's my most that's my most

19
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:24,160
anticipated reveal and I gotta say Sony as they always do. They fucking followed through with

20
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:29,840
those falling down. Show me those big furry nuts. That's really delivered to. Yeah, that's

21
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:37,520
but those are not the nuts of a young being appropriate. Well aged nuts. He's been around

22
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:43,520
the block big big big beautiful nuts though. I did like when the nuts are revealed and

23
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:48,400
banjo-kazooie from the side of the stage just yelled they both in unison just yelled like nice

24
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:53,520
nice nice nuts. You know the funny thing about it is it really with the games in a new perspective

25
00:02:53,520 --> 00:03:01,520
for me because the way he is spinning and gesticulating and jumping and running that can't

26
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:07,120
have provided ball comfort. Yeah that had to be really unpleasant for the balls. They tried to

27
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:12,800
do a fun thing where his mask friend floated down to like try to cover up the nuts but it wasn't

28
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:17,520
fast enough. I definitely saw the nuts. I thought what was weird what was weird about the whole

29
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:23,520
experience is that Carlos Bandicoot didn't even like seem fazed like it's not so revealed and he

30
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:28,960
just stood there like kind of shrugging like yep that the hardest part about it for me was not the

31
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:35,360
reveal of the nuts because I thought that was tasteful and on-brand but for the when he went

32
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:41,920
for 20 minutes afterwards just going what do you think what do you think I mean the audience

33
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:46,960
the audience ate it up though and I did think it was a little bit sad maybe uh when later

34
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:53,280
Ratchet and Clank came out there and then Clank revealed like big metal nuts um and not like

35
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:59,120
sorry it's not like a fun sort of hardware nuts but actual like metal balls like testicles but

36
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:03,920
they were made in a lab they were made a lab in there but then Clank was just like is this what

37
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:11,680
you got is this whatever does everyone like this and then um Sony announced Shenmue 4 yeah which is

38
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:18,480
wild it was so sick I was so excited this one is all forklifts also Sonic the Hedgehog Origins

39
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:24,880
in which he is very slow for the first 90% of the game and he gets hit by lightning or something

40
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:31,120
something we don't know we don't know what I thought was great was at the end yeah remember

41
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:36,240
the screen went black and you're like well that's it and then they were like just one more thing

42
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:42,640
and then Kratos it showed Kratos and he was like I've got nuts too and he started to peel it away

43
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:50,080
and then it was like black screen coming in 2018 and it's like I yeah yeah I'm on board to see

44
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:58,880
Kratos's nuts in 11 years yeah it's coming in a lot in a while Travis when do you think 2018 is

45
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:03,040
Travis oh I thought you said for some reason I heard 2028 I don't know why it's different that

46
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:08,960
would be quite the dev cycle well Justin it takes a while to get the right texture mapping

47
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:16,800
do you want half ass balls I'm sorry Justin do you want half ass balls is that what is going on with

48
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:23,040
with Gordon with my man Gordon is Gabe just trying to get the balls my new gun in this one

49
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:30,960
is balls he's just got perfect physics laden balls worth the wait and what's weird is they also

50
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:38,000
revealed uh saints row five very tasteful no nudity no balls they were like now everyone's

51
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:44,960
doing balls it's an it's a children's edgy game it is fucking weird it's so weird they were like

52
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:51,520
you know what we've pushed the boundary we've come back around the other side now very tasteful

53
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:58,400
uh like a downton abbey-esque kind of game from the people at saints row and what's and it's great

54
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:02,400
the next dragon age announced that too they're doing like a pokemon red blue version one where

55
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:07,120
there's a version with lots of huge balls on all the dragons and on everybody and then there's one

56
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:12,960
where it's more um pure I guess and the balls are much more tasteful balls anything any other

57
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:18,880
funny things we can say about video games balls something about mario's balls I don't think that's

58
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:23,840
pretty careless that's well trod at this point he has those things out for anybody that'll ask

59
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:32,160
that wouldn't have been a reveal at all um so I had yeah what I didn't like was seeing madden's

60
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:39,600
balls again it's like every year we have it's like ea feels like they have to show us man's balls

61
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:45,280
and it's like we get it they're the same balls as last year but they look a little bit better now I

62
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:50,160
don't know how that arc is working by the way whatever madden is doing for those bad boys is

63
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:56,720
working for him uh I will say I did appreciate that they finally just like you know just admitted

64
00:06:56,720 --> 00:07:02,080
the truth and just called it what it is and announced the new ball of duty game okay and

65
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:10,400
that's it that's the logical terminus there's our stop boop boop everybody off uh on this show we

66
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:16,000
talk about video game characters balls but also sometimes give advice in between so I'd like to

67
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:21,280
get right to it about a year ago I went to a party at my friend's new place during the event I walked

68
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:26,960
straight through the screen door oh oh man oh about 20 minutes later another party goer did

69
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:36,080
the exact same thing and the door was ruined that's true okay hold on uh I'll get to the

70
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:39,760
science a second door's ruined now one year later my friend's roommate is asking me to pay for the

71
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:44,320
replacement of the door as they move out what should I do I caused the damage but so did the

72
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:48,480
other guy isn't this past the statute of limitations and that's from egregious door

73
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:53,360
smasher in Everett Washington okay so what I don't understand is how you walked through the

74
00:07:53,360 --> 00:08:02,000
screen door yet left enough more enough for somebody else to penetrate like you took down

75
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,840
you took down a couple cubes of the don't break the ice but then somebody else came in and finished

76
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:12,480
the fight it sounds like maybe a little bit perhaps person a the question asker is on the

77
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:17,520
shorter side so when they walk through they tore out like one side and the bottom I see I see I see

78
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:24,480
person two is much taller and they took out the top section um I will say if two folks in one night

79
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:30,320
walk through the same screen door that is a design failure on part of the door maybe the mesh was too

80
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:36,960
fine you're lucky it didn't just like grate you you could have walked into it and just come out

81
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:42,160
the other side like play-doh spaghetti cube two hyper cubed right there all over the floor and

82
00:08:42,160 --> 00:08:45,840
then that's another thing they have to pay that's coming out of the damage deposit is that there's

83
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:53,440
just cubes of Brian all over um I as far as the statute of limitations that gets so tricky because

84
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:58,880
this is the type of thing that like it happens and it's at a party and you had a few Beverly's

85
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:03,120
and you look over and your friend fucking Kool-Aid man smashes through your screen door and it's

86
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:06,240
very very funny and then when it's time to move out you look at that same screen door and you're

87
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:13,920
like oh yeah we have to pay for that and so I think it comes up again um well but Griffin I

88
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:19,200
would say that the statute of limitations for this is the 20 minutes it took for the next person to

89
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:24,240
walk through it because if you separated that out longer if you're like yeah I ran into my friend's

90
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:29,120
screen door and then three months later someone else did it and like it was completely demolished

91
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:33,680
at that point you wouldn't be like okay well you're both responsible now I would say like

92
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:38,720
wait hold on that is that person's responsible I may have started it but they definitely finished

93
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:45,680
it yeah but you could make the argument that it was you who necessitated the fixing in the first

94
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:50,640
place you normal you normalize the process of of Hulk smashing through the screen door your

95
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:54,800
friends saw you do it was like I well I guess it's okay I guess everybody's smashing the screen

96
00:09:54,800 --> 00:10:01,840
door policy here um fuck at the same time though I can't imagine how funny this was and I think

97
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:07,120
that that pays for itself like yeah I gotta you know I gotta dish out like 70 bucks or whatever

98
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:12,160
to fix the door but um I had 70 bucks worth of laughter and funny story do y'all remember when

99
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:17,680
I did this at uncle Dave's uncle Dave's house we were we were over at our uncle Dave's house

100
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:27,520
down in Florida and um this was this was a fucking decade ago and I saw a golf cart out in his driveway

101
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:33,440
and I saw it and I guess I thought in my mind I was gonna go and hop in the golf cart and like

102
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:39,680
do a few laps around the community uh and I said out loud Grand Theft Auto and look at referencing

103
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:44,720
the game not the crime and I just went right through the fucking thing and to me it was really

104
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:50,160
really funny and that but uncle Dave got pretty upset and then later on I called I called uncle

105
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:54,480
Dave to apologize but I could not stop laughing over the phone and so I do not think the apology

106
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:59,600
was accepted or believed it's very funny to watch somebody do this because it's a door doors are

107
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:05,360
supposed to keep this from happening and when it doesn't it is very very hysterical yes we'll pay

108
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:11,920
for it fine we'll do it fine send us a bill voice and we'll and we'll take care of it clarify

109
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:18,240
just that clear itemized we need an itemized invoice itemized invoice labor not too expensive

110
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:22,640
get somebody who knows what they're doing can I do a real quick yahoo and then a better yahoo

111
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:27,200
yeah I'd love that this quick one is like it took me on a journey it was sent by Seth Carlson thank

112
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:34,000
you Seth yahoo answers user exciting nine who asks um I thought Obama was supposed to make the

113
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:39,520
commercials on tv be the same volume as the shows what happened to this commercials commercials are

114
00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:48,640
still like twice as loud as shows to me this makes him a lame duck president pretty busted um metric

115
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:56,640
this is very funny huh so the FCC actually did a thing they passed a bill in 2010 called the

116
00:11:56,640 --> 00:12:03,360
calm act the commercial advertisement loudness mitigation act where you get a penalty if you if

117
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:13,360
you fucking go from like oh Deborah oh my mom's come over again we got new spaghetti come on down

118
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:19,040
and get this spaghetti if you do that you get fined like a bunch of money but it doesn't seem

119
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:25,920
to I guess this is one where they're just like how do you enforce that if somebody records it on

120
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:31,840
their tv and then they send you the tv recording of the spaghetti crime and then the channel gets

121
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:38,080
the channel gets blasted they must be just the profit margins on the spaghetti must just be so

122
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:44,480
good it's like whatever it takes just blaze it I would also I would also just like to jump in here

123
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:52,480
um before anybody tweets or anything that's also just not what lame duck means in any political

124
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:58,800
content that's just because you didn't accomplish something doesn't make you a lame duck that's a

125
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:05,840
very specific thing um anyways just wanted to clarify that I like this idea of like I thought

126
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:12,880
he said he was gonna clean up the streets well lame duck mayor this is this is since having a

127
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:18,800
uh a baby who goes to sleep at like six o'clock this is my this is probably the most pressing

128
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:25,680
concern for me now which is me and me and rachel are watching the big bang theory just like quietly

129
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:31,120
chuckling like fighting the earth should just scream a good cackle out what did he say about

130
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:40,800
the flesh yeah so he's like he's like he's like uh captain mccard and cling on then dr who and

131
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:53,520
board games and then it's just like pepsi's got it just like scream like like fucking tyrese just

132
00:13:53,520 --> 00:14:00,880
like shows up on the on my screen for pepsi and he's just like pepsi's got it screaming and it

133
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:07,280
knocks all of the pictures off my walls on my house and all i just replaced all the windows

134
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:14,400
in the house and those have exploded and the baby the baby's crib like collapses like a cartoon like

135
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:18,160
all the wood falls apart we i believe have touched on this in a previous episode but i'd love to

136
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:23,600
circle around about it now that you all are in this situation how miserable are tv shows and i'm

137
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:28,800
looking at you twin peaks i hate to to drag you on this how miserable are tv shows where

138
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:35,280
dialogue is mixed to the quietest possible volume and every single footfall is like a thousand

139
00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:39,680
megaton bomb just i just i do want to say it's interesting that you would single out twin peaks

140
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:46,800
where the dialogue to no dialogue ratio is like pretty astounding one percent dialogue but yes

141
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:53,920
i do agree that especially if there's any kind of supernatural or fantasy element fucking dragons are

142

148
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:40,960
and it's always the same thing with the intro music and it's like hey local local government

149
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:52,480
joke let's so what do we do we need the sequel to the calm act the calmer act as proposed by

150
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:57,760
the mackeroy brothers so that their babies so their babies cribs don't explode when the pepsi

151
00:15:57,760 --> 00:16:02,560
commercial comes on let me let me propose this what if it said there's just a service where like

152
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:07,120
somebody comes to your house and they just ride the volume button like they're just there they're

153
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:15,840
not enjoying the thing at all they're just like mute ah yes ah damn it um anyway this is the thing

154
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:23,920
i thought i saw this question i was like another goofball on yahoo being a silly billy but no i

155
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:29,120
mean this wasn't obama's jurisdiction i don't think but there was there's a law about this

156
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:34,640
that apparently this is just one of those laws like many laws that you can just be like no we're

157
00:16:34,640 --> 00:16:40,400
just gonna keep doing doing it i have an idea i have an idea you're gonna love that everybody's

158
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:49,840
gonna love this it is a way more enforceable law pass a law all commercials the voiceover work has

159
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:56,480
to be done by roman mars oh i love this you're welcome i was just telling roman mars yesterday

160
00:16:56,480 --> 00:17:03,040
that i'm gonna load up like an mp3 player and just play it like on a loop uh of 99 invisible

161
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:09,120
in my baby's room so that she will both learn um to speak eloquently but also like not get

162
00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:16,480
woken up by big spikes of like yelling i gotcha i gotcha can i pitch you a different idea yes

163
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:22,320
a new law that says that every line of dialogue on every tv show from now on has to be screamed

164
00:17:22,320 --> 00:17:27,360
at the top of your lungs and because then even that would normalize it even then i could i could

165
00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:32,880
turn my volume down to a regular volume so that when tyrese is like pepsi's got it and it gets

166
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:39,440
back and it's like mike did you drop the car off with the mechanic no molly i forgot damn it mike

167
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:44,480
that's from mike and molly uh classic scene from mike and molly i think that would solve

168
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:49,840
the problem too okay wait wait alternate alternate government next up on tonight's show we got the

169
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:56,640
weekend how about all commercials are voiced by roman mars but also all parts and all tv shows

170
00:17:56,640 --> 00:18:07,440
are played by roman mars i would do that 88 some mars adr no no no he plays every part oh um the

171
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:18,640
one who knocks um he's gonna be busy he's gonna be very busy uh here's another question i park

172
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:23,680
about 15 minutes away from work but i don't mind because it's a nice walk through a field last week

173
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:31,040
i saw a teen planting a five-foot conifer when we made eye contact he got rather weird and hid

174
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:36,800
around to the other side of it you gotta help me through this i walk past it every day now and i

175
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:44,880
don't know why he hid ideas that's from confused about the conifer holy shit three possibilities

176
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:53,840
okay y'all tell me what you think nymph dryad or some sort of satyr it's one of the it's definitely

177
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:58,320
one of the three it's definitely supernatural definitely supernatural it's a nymph it's a

178
00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:04,400
nymph it's a dryad or it's a satyr it was the spirit of this tree one way or the other i mean

179
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:10,960
whatever the the form it took is i think we can all agree that there's definitely you um this is

180
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:16,960
a narnia ask mr tumness like invitation to go on our fantasy world but you had to get to work

181
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:22,160
definitely tumness definitely tumness we're looking at full-on tumness find that tree got a

182
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:27,920
hole put your head in the hole there you go down you go to the other world to the other one follow

183
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:33,200
him follow the tumness always follow the tumness you always have to stop what you're doing drop

184
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:37,440
what you're doing and follow the tumness 100 of the time gotta follow the tumness till you

185
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:41,200
reach the terminus that's what i've always said do you know how many tumness opportunities like

186
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:46,480
how many people get tumness opportunities in this life not many not many i've never i've

187
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:50,800
never fucking had one but if i did you can bet i would drop what i was doing stop what i was doing

188
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:57,360
and go get that tumness that's it i did once oh shit yeah i mean time didn't pass the same for

189
00:19:57,360 --> 00:20:02,320
you guys so i yeah i was only gone for like five minutes but from my view i was gone for 25 years

190
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:09,520
and that's um when i learned french um and and cross stitching um you forgot the you forgot the

191
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:14,240
french i forgot the french part um i didn't learn it great i learned it like high school learned it

192
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:20,560
you know enough to pass um but that was it i actually um now looking back in retrospect i

193
00:20:20,560 --> 00:20:26,080
probably could have spent more time away from tumness exploring narnia mostly i just hung out

194
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:31,920
with tumness cross stitching and speaking french so on the on the off chance this is in a tumness

195
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:39,040
scenario the only other explanation is that look when you're a teen you're almost always looking

196
00:20:39,040 --> 00:20:48,160
for places to make out or smoke weed and so this person was probably planting a lovely tree

197
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:55,440
just to have one more spot in the world where they could go and have some some sneaky some sneak

198
00:20:55,440 --> 00:21:00,000
time a little bit of sneak time okay like there's there's not enough places there's not enough little

199
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:07,600
shadowy spots and um you know elements to break line of sight in this field that he likes to

200
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:15,360
get blazed or make kisses in and so they planted this tree to have like a little zone a little them

201
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:19,840
zone i really like this forward thinking that you're pitching here griffin where they planted

202
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:25,680
uh what a five foot tall tree yep and and thought man in a hundred years i'm really gonna enjoy

203
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:31,360
smoking weed behind well travis what are they gonna do carry a massive redwood into this

204
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:36,240
field no they're right you're right you're right you know what i was wrong and you were right um i

205
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:41,280
do also want to say question asker it's also quite possible that what you were witnessing appeared

206
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:47,120
to be a teen planting a tree but was in fact a teen contemplating stealing a tree

207
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:56,960
hmm and you foiled it i want to i like to i'd like to go back and pitch the visual mental picture of

208
00:21:56,960 --> 00:22:05,600
an 80 year old person taking another person into a big field where a big tall proud conifer is there

209
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:11,200
and he goes up and puts his hand on the tree and tells the story of how he planted it and how he

210
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:15,360
always been waiting for this moment more or less his entire life and then he just pulls out the

211
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:22,640
biggest duper and is like all right let's party it's time grandson it's time to do this damn thing

212
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:29,760
i planted this smoke tree for you for us this is our family legacy

213
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:42,320
um oh i was so hoping whoa we got a haunted doll watch oh it's been forever i feel like haunted

214
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:49,120
doll watch has been thoroughly munched by the munch squad let me blow the dust off the tome yeah

215
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:58,160
haunted doll janet very high emf uh i'm gonna go ahead and skype you all a link if you're

216
00:22:58,160 --> 00:23:03,360
playing at home you can feel free to google don't read ahead please i would ask you can

217
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:09,040
just enjoy the pictures of haunted doll jen very active hi i gotta say she's got um

218
00:23:09,040 --> 00:23:15,200
um a lot of just a lot of hair and what looks like some mardi gras beads sort of

219
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:20,320
that's binding her the first fun thing is that she's been bound by mardi gras beads in this one

220
00:23:21,040 --> 00:23:27,840
janet is an active essence she is enjoyed mostly in the early morning hours at just at sunset

221
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:35,760
ill the tilapia may i recommend a janet this one has been aged for many years she prefers

222
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:40,480
to be why do you like run out of bed every morning you don't understand my janet is

223
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:45,200
best in the early morning hours and oh you want to catch janet you gotta get up before

224
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:51,760
early bird gets the spooky doll she prefers to be away from a window but what's a view to the

225
00:23:51,760 --> 00:24:01,040
outside enjoy this periscope janet fuck off you're about to feel bad i feel that this is because her

226
00:24:01,040 --> 00:24:06,880
essence was shut away during her life and was warned against being seen by outsiders parentheses

227
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:15,920
maybe hiding during world war i mean fucking maybe a big swing yeah just take a shot at it

228
00:24:16,560 --> 00:24:23,680
uh when i put it on a show maybe against the devil when i put her on the shelf maybe like in

229
00:24:23,680 --> 00:24:28,800
maybe she was trapped in a cupboard like indian in the cupboard you don't know you don't know when i

230
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:32,880
put her on a shelf with other vessels the next morning she would be on the floor she doesn't

231
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:37,200
like to be around other people well that sounds more like a problem with the other dolls being

232
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:45,680
bullies communicating with her was ellipses fluid it's so natural what does that mean just

233
00:24:45,680 --> 00:24:54,960
natural sweaty janet are you feeling this i gave this this early morning vibe i gained my insights

234
00:24:54,960 --> 00:25:01,760
by sitting with her over a l-o-n-g hyphenated period of time it's high it's it's heightening

235
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:06,960
the longness of this period of time and allowing the conceptualization to enter my consciousness

236
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:13,120
with my other dolls the feeling i got from them was singular i would get a strong feeling over

237
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:18,640
time much like you sit quietly in the wilderness and begin to hear sounds that you did not pick up

238
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:25,840
immediately you experience the tapestry as a gestalt rather than focusing on any individual

239
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:30,960
threads within the tapestry it was in these times that she would be the most active with me

240
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:36,480
janet doll is made from porcelain and i believe it is five feet there's no reality

241
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:46,480
what the fuck there's a picture there's a picture of it standing next to a thing of incense that it

242
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:53,600
is as big as is this a five foot novelty incense stick well i do want okay two things one go to

243
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:57,840
this and look at the pictures because what i love is you get one picture of doll by yourself and then

244
00:25:57,840 --> 00:26:05,040
two separate pictures of the uh incense candle picture as if they're like which one of these

245
00:26:05,040 --> 00:26:10,560
do you think is best you know what i'll do both both and then secondly justin that was very

246
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:18,160
charitable of you in describing what janet doll is made from um because you said porcelain when in

247
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:25,040
fact the material that they claim is procalian procalian is a new material um that we're we're

248
00:26:25,040 --> 00:26:31,120
all really excited about the new tesla models are mostly procalian this is um not five feet tall

249
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:36,560
that's correct it's not a fucking in any way it's not a fucking blockbuster cardboard stand-up of

250
00:26:36,560 --> 00:26:42,320
the rock okay it's like little doll this is such false advertising that i believe this person could

251
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:48,960
actually go to jail for how much how bad they whiffed this size estimation um also just real

252
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:53,040
quick starting bid 95 bucks or buy it now for 150 you know i don't want to stress about it

253
00:26:53,040 --> 00:27:06,400
three folks watching oh that's us there's i don't like to stress out i don't want to put the 95 in

254
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:12,240
you pay an extra 65 bucks for the 150 buy it now but just the peace of mind that it brings me is

255
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:17,200
so worth it so i can have this in my door estimated between wednesday june 14th and

256
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:22,720
monday june 19th like fucking like yeah all right let's do it i'm gonna pull the trigger

325
00:35:02,080 --> 00:35:07,280
sent this one in thank you everyone seriously i think like six people so an anonymous yahoo user

326
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:17,120
um say janet asks how do you avoid getting water up your rear when going on certain water slides

327
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:21,680
update update update like the really steep fast ones with lots of water pressure

328
00:35:23,360 --> 00:35:30,480
i i think everybody's sort of got their own way of dealing with this um me i've started to sort

329
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:39,280
of work with a kind of hydrophobic um tight sort of unders undersuit that i wear under my swimsuit

330
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:47,120
so smart that keeps everything just like gunpowder dry and so like it's not even it's hydrophobic so

331
00:35:47,120 --> 00:35:52,240
like i'm going in the water from the water slide it's like let me get in that rear end but my

332
00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:57,440
my undershorts are just like think think about it again i'm very afraid of you you know what i mean

333
00:35:57,440 --> 00:36:02,560
when you go down the water slide the water goes it just naturally wants to snake up there

334
00:36:03,520 --> 00:36:08,560
and i guess i'm asking like how you don't how you don't maybe get it

335
00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:18,880
two scrunchies two scrunchies hold the trunks oh the trunks for the trunk's legs closed you know

336
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:22,480
what i mean i'm turning into a kind of a they'll kind of look like a pantaloon i think at that

337
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:27,360
point yeah that would look kind of nice and then you and then you also have a sort of tourniquet

338
00:36:27,360 --> 00:36:32,720
situation which is good if like one of your something happens to the legs that's possible

339
00:36:32,720 --> 00:36:37,760
on a water slide you could just do what i did what did you did uh what i did was i just had

340
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:52,560
skin grafted over my butthole so no no not yet okay not yet not yet just like permanently sealed it

341
00:36:54,960 --> 00:37:02,160
just in case of water slides i now will say travis this is a lot of folks here this thing

342
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:08,880
what a crass joke travis is his biggest tube junkie i ever met he loves those big wet tubes and he goes

343
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:18,800
down them all the time so like if somebody were to kind of like water world uh kurt costner got

344
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:23,040
the gills put in just because he swims all the time like travis gets on those wet tubes all the

345
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:30,000
time and so like he does need like a a practical um easy solution let me be clear it is not

346
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:34,800
the only modification i've made i mean my whole butt cracker is now smooth it's one whole cheek

347
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:41,280
i've also had the points of my elbows and knees shaved down to help with my arrow uh die

348
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:50,400
uh you know aerodynamics uh dynamicism yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah i think aqua dynamics is what you're

349
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:54,880
thinking of because it's not just it's not just you don't just gotta seal up the craft you want

350
00:37:54,880 --> 00:38:02,560
it to go as fast as is possible on those tubes my arms are permanently bound to my sides oh wow

351
00:38:02,560 --> 00:38:07,760
yeah no listen um and i also shaved my eyebrows off so like there's a lot of steps what's the

352
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:18,160
eyebrows for just for looks um do you think if you got trunks tattooed on they would let you go

353
00:38:18,160 --> 00:38:30,240
on they would let you go down naked oh say it again if you got trunks or a you know bikini

354
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:35,600
bottoms or one piece of whatever tattooed on do you think they would let you go down naked

355
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:40,560
if you have a tattoo i i wish i could say no but

356
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:44,240
it does look like you're wearing trunks i can't tell any difference

357
00:38:44,240 --> 00:38:50,240
yeah you know what i'm gonna say go ahead i'm gonna let it go i'm a 17 year old he doesn't care

358
00:38:50,240 --> 00:38:56,880
so sure fuck it and i'm crash bandicoot and i'm ready to slide you must be wearing some

359
00:38:56,880 --> 00:39:04,080
sort of trunks because i can't see any kind of butt crack yeah yeah exactly oh my god he's so fast

360
00:39:04,080 --> 00:39:08,560
holy shit all right three two one and go and you're out what how did that what

361
00:39:08,560 --> 00:39:12,480
you there was another kid in the slide you shot through them what the fuck

362
00:39:13,680 --> 00:39:18,160
uh a fun thing to do when you get on a water slice the last thing you should say the person is

363
00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:22,880
time me and then they'll feel like oh how am i supposed to get this information to him actually

364
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:27,120
yeah time him with none of that stuff and then another fun thing just before you get in the

365
00:39:27,120 --> 00:39:33,680
water slide yeah like the window's about to close i have to go now yeah jump in but then just before

366
00:39:33,680 --> 00:39:38,800
you reach the bottom kind of pin your arms to the sides so like you hold yourself in place so when

367
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:44,080
the person's looking you don't come out the bottom you must have slid and now they're remembering

368
00:39:44,080 --> 00:39:48,320
sliders and how much they love and how much they love that show i really don't want them to be

369
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:59,600
distracted though it's an important job they have yeah um wow i think it's okay i think it's okay

370
00:39:59,600 --> 00:40:05,920
for a little water to go up yeah it can be nice can be good it's like a bidet it's just like a

371
00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:13,360
bidet one time when i was a little kid we were at a water park outdoor maybe the one at king's

372
00:40:13,360 --> 00:40:21,200
island if that was if that was extra yeah yeah yeah uh and i was so thirsty oh no for whatever

373
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:28,560
reason our parents wouldn't buy me a drink and i don't know why maybe they were too expensive or i

374
00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:33,760
don't know why but i have maybe they didn't love you maybe they didn't care whether it was they

375
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:39,840
they they had just bought me a drink and so like they were just kind of tired uh can i show griffins

376
00:40:39,840 --> 00:40:48,800
absolutely not what a dumb question uh so i slid down a water slide and at the bottom of the slide

377
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:56,480
slid down a water slide and at the bottom of the water slide i forced myself when i landed in the

378
00:40:56,480 --> 00:41:03,600
splash pool i forced myself to take a big gulp of water oh my god this is the most viscerally

379
00:41:03,600 --> 00:41:08,640
upsetting like i'm not joking the most upsetting thing that has been discussed on this episode so

380
00:41:08,640 --> 00:41:14,160
far and more so than travis's like butthole modifications now let me ask it's the whole

381
00:41:14,160 --> 00:41:21,840
crack griffin let me ask you this one time i was leaving new york and i went to the wrong airport

382
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:29,760
and i realized at the last moment and hop back in the cab and paid the guy to as like a private car

383
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:34,960
like he was also moonlighting for carmel so i asked him to like i will pay you to take me to

384
00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:38,960
newark and i was at laguardia and he was like well it's gonna be tight making it there and he

385
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:43,680
just floored it and i realized that i was planning on getting a drink at the airport and hadn't

386
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:48,880
drank anything all day and i was thirstier than i've ever been in my entire life except for the

387
00:41:48,880 --> 00:41:56,720
time that i drank water out of a splash splash water park and i noticed in the door of the cab

388
00:41:56,720 --> 00:42:04,960
someone left half a water bottle um there and i did pick it up and drink it because i was so

389
00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:10,320
thirsty now my question to you is this wait wait hold on sealed water bottle already open no half

390
00:42:10,320 --> 00:42:16,000
empty i said half empty okay that would have been quite the fucking feat um so what's worse

391
00:42:16,720 --> 00:42:19,920
one of them didn't have other people bathing and lounging around and splashing around with

392
00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:25,440
their kids and having fun and playing that one's chlorinated though here's the thing

393
00:42:25,440 --> 00:42:32,640
justin have you thought about that your entire life after drinking from the wave pool has been

394
00:42:32,640 --> 00:42:41,280
a lie a few fever state brought on by the consuming of that horrible poison and everything now is your

395
00:42:42,080 --> 00:42:50,000
like your brain just giving you images to cover up for your like pool water coma like i'm still

396
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:57,360
there in the pool yeah and all of this has just been like kind of an oracle at delphi kind of

397
00:42:57,360 --> 00:43:03,600
warp forward like you're you breathed in the vapors and now you're able to see time in all

398
00:43:03,600 --> 00:43:10,160
of its many forms and facets well i mean possible but you have to assume then at that point that

399
00:43:10,160 --> 00:43:16,720
i've been kept alive in stasis in the wave pool this entire time so yeah like a precog people

400
00:43:16,720 --> 00:43:21,200
are just splash downing around oh watch out for the little tubby guy hold on let me float him

401
00:43:21,200 --> 00:43:27,440
over to the other side darn it he's helping tom cruise solve mysteries you gotta watch out for

402
00:43:27,440 --> 00:43:34,400
him darn it grab the umbrella what did he say drop the nickels what did he say what is he saying

403
00:43:34,400 --> 00:43:40,560
i couldn't hear him over the water slide it's only he's a precog but he only can sense um

404
00:43:41,280 --> 00:43:46,880
uh waterslide park crime yeah like that there should be more cheese in there it's supposed to

405
00:43:46,880 --> 00:43:51,600
be three fourths of the way filled up on those nachos he's starting to wake up out of it but

406
00:43:51,600 --> 00:43:56,240
we haven't solved this crime here quick give him that gross bottle of water and get him back into

407
00:43:56,240 --> 00:44:02,080
it it's a re that's a that's a refill collectible refill mug that he brought from home he didn't buy

408
00:44:02,080 --> 00:44:06,720
that today i'm a senior in high school my class has been pretty lame with the pranks so the other

409
00:44:06,720 --> 00:44:12,400
night i gathered up some friends and decided to fork the football field and that's stick plastic

410
00:44:12,400 --> 00:44:16,880
forks in it to spell some stuff or just be a nuisance we were doing well for about an hour

411
00:44:16,880 --> 00:44:20,960
when several cop cars pulled up and we had to drop everything and run i managed to escape but

412
00:44:20,960 --> 00:44:26,080
i left my sister's backpack behind i was using it to carry extra forks it's definitely been

413
00:44:26,080 --> 00:44:31,280
confiscated by now but she doesn't know i used it should i turn myself in and get her backpack back

414
00:44:31,280 --> 00:44:36,000
or should i be just the worst and pretend i have no idea where it went i risk being charged with

415
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:39,760
trespassing because i was on school grounds at 1 a.m and ran from cops that's from perplexed

416
00:44:39,760 --> 00:44:45,600
prankster p.s i managed to write zag on him before we were chased off god not in our name

417
00:44:46,240 --> 00:44:52,560
taking the day the next day when everyone found the prank um there are photos i look forward to

418
00:44:52,560 --> 00:44:58,160
you later can i just say just uh personally i one of the things i really love about this is

419
00:44:58,880 --> 00:45:05,440
the idea of forking um is very funny to me um because it seems definitely like a nuisance

436
00:46:47,280 --> 00:46:52,880

437
00:46:52,880 --> 00:47:02,320
everybody hold up amazon.com and then we gonna type in the name of the backpack brand jansport

438
00:47:02,320 --> 00:47:08,720
backpack in luggage and travel gear this is fifteen dollars and eighty two cents come on

439
00:47:09,360 --> 00:47:14,080
should i go to jail or should i pay fifteen dollars and eighty two cents to get a new jansport

440
00:47:14,080 --> 00:47:20,160
a new fresh jansport with like no you don't you know how jansport in any backpack really

441
00:47:20,160 --> 00:47:24,800
just even if you never put food in it it gets food crumbles in the bottom of it at some point

442
00:47:25,440 --> 00:47:34,320
a fresh start no crumbles and also no crumbles but also no jail what if you went to the police of

443
00:47:34,320 --> 00:47:41,440
like the police station and you just incredibly dramatically threw yourself on the mercy of the

444
00:47:41,440 --> 00:47:48,880
officers in order to reclaim your sister's backpack just like very like i did it i was

445

446
00:47:54,320 --> 00:47:59,600
like tear your shirt gnashing your teeth my bet is they'll just hand you the backpack and tell you

447
00:47:59,600 --> 00:48:04,400
to leave because they're very busy no no fifteen dollars and eighty two cents eighty two cents to

448
00:48:04,400 --> 00:48:09,920
get out of this right the other option is you go and you think like oh it's just a harmless prank

449
00:48:09,920 --> 00:48:15,280
they are always always always casting for scared straight a hundred percent of the time they're
