1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:30,800
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:44,560
It's a new craze, and good girls do you wanna just say, hey, I wanna, just say, hey, I wanna.

6
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:46,640
Hello, everybody, and welcome to My Brother, My Brother. I made a device show for the

7
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:54,640
modern era. I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy. I'm your middle-est brother, Travis McElroy.

8
00:00:54,640 --> 00:01:01,120
I'm your sweet baby brother, and 30 under 30 media luminary, Griffin McElroy.

9
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:08,480
Thank you. It's Father's Day, and I know we really shouldn't start out with this kind of energy,

10
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:14,560
but Dad's saying, we love it here, it's very great. It's the most disingenuous thing I've

11
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:19,520
ever heard anybody say on a stage. It feels like something that was written in a different language

12
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:28,240
and translated to English. It's true, but yeah, so he didn't sell it. I love him. He's my dad.

13
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:32,720
He didn't sell it. He didn't sell it. Didn't sell it. Though, to be fair, that might be because

14
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:40,400
we've only been in Indianapolis for 20 minutes. Your whole state, Indiana, flooded. Yes, made

15
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:45,600
it tricky to get here. It was rough. It was hard. It was probably harder on other people.

16
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:50,960
Yes. Now that I'm saying it, yeah. So this is a very special tour for us, both of you,

17
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:55,600
Become the Monster Tour, but also this leg of it, because it was very close to at least two

18
00:01:55,600 --> 00:02:03,520
out of the three of our home cities, we took a bus for the first time. Like big-time tour boys.

19
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:08,160
Yeah, because it was cheaper. It was cheaper. That was the main reason. It was cheaper,

20
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:14,880
and there's like 15 of us, not an exaggeration. Yeah. And our kids could nap on the bus. Woo,

21
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:20,800
party. They didn't, but in theory, they could have. If you're thinking, wow, how bougie the

22
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:28,000
McElroys have sold out, I want you to imagine like the Bloodmobile, but instead of blood or

23
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:35,120
the Bookmobile, instead of books, it's adult farts, and it's the worst. Okay, so here's what

24
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:43,200
happened. We had to take Nashville farts across state lines. I want to know if everybody who is

25
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:48,480
to her, like Fleetwood Mac gets the same treatment, but we got on the bus, and the first thing we were

26
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:55,760
told is. First thing. Not only are we not allowed to, but we physically cannot poop on the bus,

27
00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:04,400
and before you ask, there is a bathroom, but it doesn't go anywhere. It says, there's a sign,

28
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:09,520
it says, if you sprinkle when you tinkle, be a sweetie, wipe the CD. So cute. No number two.

29
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:14,560
And the first, the first part of that is so adorable. It's like, hey, clean up after yourself,

30
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:22,160
really, but in a cute, charming way, and no shitting. What's that? Why is that? Well,

31
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:28,800
some buses have, we have been informed, a special, it doesn't, I don't want to get. It's called a

32
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:35,840
macerator. It's a macerator, and it chops the poop up into nothing. Now, it makes me mad, because it

33
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:44,240
seems like it should be possible to just open a hole. This is my thing. You should be able to open

34
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:50,560
the bottom of the bus with a switch, and you just do it on the road. And that's also good, because

35
00:03:50,560 --> 00:04:01,520
then racer X will skid out. Speed pushes the H button, and I take a hot shit right on the road.

36
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:05,760
I'm pretty sure after the Dave Matthews Band incident, they don't put those on buses anymore.

37
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:14,640
Then it got into this, okay, then Travis and I had this debate. You could, Travis was making

38
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:21,360
the case that you could shit in the toilet, and I said, yes, I could shit out here. I can shit lots

39
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:27,280
of places, and I stand by that shitting in a toilet versus shitting on a couch, even if the

40
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:32,880
toilet doesn't go anywhere. It's more socially acceptable than just shitting on a couch. Anyway,

41
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:37,680
that's why this three and a half hour drive from Nashville to Indianapolis took us about six and a

42
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:45,520
half hours. A lot of it was mostly just existential dread, even if you don't have to, number two. The

43
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:50,160
moment someone says you can't. Yeah, here's a fun, this will be a fun exercise. Nobody here is allowed

44
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:55,680
to get up and use the bathroom during this show. Oh, I bet you wanna though, don't you?

45
00:04:55,680 --> 00:05:01,280
Yeah. Griffin said he always goes at nine o'clock, which was a half hour after we got on the bus.

46
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:08,000
Two and a half hours later, we stopped at, you'll know, on the border of Indiana, the Arby's,

47
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:17,040
that's also a love truck stop. With the most racist t-shirts I've ever seen in my life.

48
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:23,280
You know the one. We stopped there, and Griffin went into the bathroom and came out, and I gave

49
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:28,880
him a thumbs up, like mission accomplished? He said, no, I couldn't, because my body is apparently

50
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:36,160
a grandfather clock, where if I miss my opening, I have to wait till tomorrow, apparently. All

51
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:41,920
right, we've talked about this for way too long. Way too long. This is an advice show.

52
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:51,600
Our advice to begin with is go before you get on the bus. Correct. But we do have questions.

53
00:05:51,600 --> 00:06:05,680
Riddle me piss, boys. He really. Riddle me piss. You can still riddle me piss on the bus,

54
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:14,720
boys. He really doesn't tell us these are coming. Riddle me piss. Yeah, we know the name of the

55
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:20,160
segment. Do you want to deliver the payload, please, Travis? Okay, I will say the rest of

56
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:23,360
my regular voice, because it's so important that you don't miss a second. It sucks that

57
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:25,760
you can't shit on the bus, but you can shit here on the stage.

58
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:36,720
This is an email submission, and they gave us a fun username, which you don't usually get,

59
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:44,080
but it's from Riddle Racks in Regina. Okay. It's the name of a town. Sure.

60
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:52,000
Okay, and this comes from a book called The Little Giant Book of Brain Twisters.

61
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Wait, this isn't from Riddle. It comes from The Little Giant Book of Brain Twisters.

62
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,360
Griffin, every syllable you say prolongs Riddle Me Piss. You're right. I'm sorry.

63
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:12,560
A man sat perfectly still for 88 hours. Why? I've given you all the clues.

64
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:23,360
You don't already have it? I mean, all right.

65
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:32,080
A man sat perfectly still for 88 hours. Why? He was trying to break the record for longest

66
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:38,000
continuous radio broadcast. No. I knew a guy in college that tried to do that for 88 hours,

67
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:42,720
which is why. Didn't work. I thought this was my Slumdog Millionaire moment where that obscure

68
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:50,480
knowledge would pay off in a huge, huge way. Is the man a piano? There's 88 keys on a piano.

69
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:54,960
I'm trying to think of what the significance of- How have you guys not- I gave you all the-

70
00:07:56,560 --> 00:08:01,120
Should I just tell you the answer? I wish you would. Ahem. The answer is so obvious.

71
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:07,120
The man had a nasty toothache, and he went to the dentist at 5 p.m. on a Friday evening.

72
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:10,960
The dentist's assistant, including the anesthesiologist, had all gone, and the

73
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:15,440
dentist could not admit her anesthetic. The man insisted that the dentist should operate

74
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:19,360
even without anesthetic, so the dentist said that he would have to strap the man into the chair.

75
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:25,600
This was done. The dentist then suffered a fatal heart attack and died.

76
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:38,400
The poor man was left strapped in the chair and unable to move. It was a holiday,

77
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:45,680
and no staff reported for work until 9 a.m. on the following Tuesday morning,

78
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:55,280
88 hours later. But why- Obviously! Is this a true story? Like, did this happen and they're

79
00:08:55,280 --> 00:09:01,040
relating this tale? No, it's just that it's so- Why else would it be 88 hours? Okay, if this-

80
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:05,120
Justin, I need you to think about if this was a true story, and then you are going in for a

81
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:09,680
routine dental procedure, and the dentist says, just gonna have to strap your own into the chair,

82
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:20,160
bud. Anyway, I- Luckily, we have actual advice questions to ask. I don't know, I thought that

83
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:26,560
was pretty actionable. Don't do that! Yeah, I'm an art education major at Indiana State University.

84
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:33,120
I had to take a drawing class, mainly one that focuses on the human form. Our class could only-

85
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:42,800
Grow up! Our class could only get one model, and so we had to draw the same guy twice a week for

86
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:51,520
the entire semester. I have drawn this guy 86 times, and have him just lying around my room.

87
00:09:51,520 --> 00:10:05,280
They're all huge pieces. Nice. Like, four feet tall. As a lesbian with no interest in men, what

88
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:11,440
should I do with them? I don't want to throw them out. There goes my- Obviously, that's from Abby.

89
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:24,320
Abby, are you here? Hi. Hi. Okay, so my thing, Abby, the one thing I do have to say, first off,

90
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:32,960
is- Let's invert this scenario. Let's say I took a life drawing class where I drew the same

91
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:39,920
woman 48 times, and then when people- Or, 86 times, excuse me, and then people came over,

92
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:48,240
I would be like, now listen, I love babes, and these pics get me red hot. That's not actually

93
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:58,000
how art works. We don't actually really keep pictures just because they're red. These 86

94
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:04,720
pictures that I did get me real hot, so I kept them all. That's why I go to the Louvre and I

95
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:16,000
kick holes in all the paintings that don't make me real horny. Maybe this is how that worked,

96
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:21,280
because they didn't have the internet back then, so maybe people went to DaVinci and said, hey,

97
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:30,320
can you paint me some boobs? I'm dying over here. Yeah, but if Abby was straight and she told people

98
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:37,520
that came over, I can't throw them away. They made me extremely horny. That would be the wildest shit

99
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:47,440
ever. It would be baffling. How well do you know this person? You probably know this model better

100
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:55,120
than most of your own family. Every inch. Could you give the model all this great art that you've

101
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:59,520
done, and then it's their problem, because I'll tell you what's- This is a great question,

102
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:03,760
and even better question is, I have just received 86 nude drawings of myself.

103
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:09,360
And I've run out of wall space. 86 new drawings in increasing levels of quality.

104
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:16,640
It's a flip book, and it just becomes me at the end. You had him a few times where you're like,

105
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:22,480
fuck this, today caricature. Now he's surfing. Now he's surfing. I'm doing a fun one.

106
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:30,640
He's a cowboy. He's a naked cowboy. How about a Yahoo from the Yahoo Answers service?

107
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:34,880
Yeah, we didn't- That didn't help at all.

108
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:39,360
That's the least we've helped. We, in fact, just spent the whole time discussing the premise.

109
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:44,160
Sure. I guess you could sell them at a park or something. That's something people do with art.

110
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:53,040
That's wild. That would be wild. Hi, I have 86 pre-made nude drawings of the same man. They're

111
00:12:53,040 --> 00:13:00,160
four dollars. They get increasingly more expensive. Yeah, because they get much better,

112
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:05,200
except for the caricatures. They cost less. I phoned it in. Yeah, go ahead.

113
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:08,960
No, no, no. Please, let's keep helping. It seems like we're really well-equipped for this one.

114
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:17,280
Go ahead. This Yahoo was sent in by Jim. Thanks, Jim. It's Yahoo Answers user Aaron, who asks,

115
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:21,760
my mom grounded me for eating my pudding before my sandwich.

116
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:34,880
What can I do to get out of this mess? Also, side note, I'm 48. I'm 48. Ah, shoot.

117
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:42,480
I ate all my dang pudding. Well, I didn't even know the sandwich was there. Yeah. I just had

118
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:47,120
the pudding blinders, you know what I mean? I thought it was dinner pudding, a savory dinner

119
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:53,840
pudding. Just a big cup of a cup of gravy. Yeah, shoot. No, I had to, it was in the way of the

120
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:58,800
sandwich. I had to eat my way through to get there. Tell your mom you use it as a delicious

121
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:05,760
condiment for her tasty turkey sandwich with just a thin container-sized layer of chocolate pudding.

122
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:11,360
That actually might be good. That might be good. Next question.

123
00:14:13,280 --> 00:14:21,040
What if you told your mom that you thought that her sandwiches are so delicious,

124
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:27,120
they're like the dessert. I had maybe gave her a homemade card that said, I love you,

125
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:30,400
and that might just push it. I love you. I had to eat my way through the dumb pudding

126
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:36,960
so I could treat myself to Rhonda's famous turkey sandwich. Trademark, my mom.

127
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:44,080
Pudding isn't very good, and so I don't know why you would put yourself through this.

128
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:47,920
Uh-oh. Huh, Griffin seems you've touched a nerve.

129
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:52,480
Apparently you didn't know Indianapolis is the pudding capital of the world.

130
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:56,160
Wait, is it?

131
00:14:58,640 --> 00:15:02,080
It's probably just an average level of pudding enjoyment here, I would guess.

132
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:10,480
Uh, it could be a, like, fancy British pudding, uh, in which case, a pud, yes.

133
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:15,360
And then that is a special thing, because I was thinking you could just replace the pudding and

134
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:18,720
be like, you're out of your mind, I didn't eat the pudding. It's the same pudding, but if it's

135
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:22,320
a British Pud, then you're gonna have a harder time doing that, because those things take like

136
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:27,040
a week, right? It's just any dessert, Griffin, any dessert is pudding in England. What?

137
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:33,200
We are parents of 20-month-old twins. Wait, wait, wait, is this a dry fettuccine

138
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:35,680
situation or do they just call all desserts pudding?

139
00:15:39,280 --> 00:15:43,520
To be fair, they only have pudding. They don't know any different.

140
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:46,640
They don't have pie? Not yet. Shoot.

141
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:52,800
Oh, pudding. Pudding and Fammies. That's another one of my favorite bits when Griffin didn't know

142
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:58,480
what a Fanny was. Yeah, this podcast is just a fucking carousel of me not knowing things.

143
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:04,880
Take your pick. We are parents of 20-month-old twins, a boy and a girl, I'm so sorry. That's a

144
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:09,840
lot of children. It's a lot of kid. Uh, and for the most part, we haven't done a completely

145
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:17,600
terrible job of raising them. You would have no way of knowing that. Sorry. They only steal from

146
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:24,960
each other in polite ways, and when they yell in public, it mostly seems cute. So far. So far.

147
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:30,320
To you. But they're getting old enough that soon they will understand the concept of age. So,

148
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:39,680
do we ever tell them who was born first? Or do we leave it a mystery? That's from J and E. Are you

149
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:51,680
both here? Hi. Oh, hey. Parents of the year over here didn't bring the kids. Guys, come on.

150
00:16:51,680 --> 00:17:00,720
Shh. Guys, come on. We would love to have your children. We've got eight or nine backstage

151
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:08,160
already. Just bring them on. Add them to the lot. Here's what I would do. I would withhold

152
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:15,120
this information as long as humanly possible. I would, if they ask you, when they do ask you,

153
00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:18,000
and they will, which one was born first, look them down in the eye and say, I would have no way of

154
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:27,360
knowing that. I was whacked out of my mind. You all look wicked the same. It was a pretty wild time.

155
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:36,160
I had plans for later in the afternoon that I had to get to. Yeah. Real busy. There's one option.

156
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:42,800
You could do that one. You could also tell them they came out at the same time. Now that's fun.

157
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:49,840
That's fun. Hugging each other. Aww. No, I'm thinking like shoulder to shoulder. Just like,

158
00:17:52,400 --> 00:18:02,640
just sister and sisters. Never wear this one. Top hat. You could also use it as like a reward system

159
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:08,240
of like whoever does the most chores this week was born first. Nice. Whoever cleans the room the best

160
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:13,440
next week was born first. And just have it trade back and forth and have it be maybe like a mantle

161
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:19,040
that you hand back and forth. And never tell them. You can't tell them it's the problem. It'll ruin

162
00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:23,840
the whole thing, I feel like. Ever since Justin found out he was born first, there's been no

163
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:32,640
living with him. I remember that day last week. Heartbreak. You see he has a beard so you can

164
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:41,440
understand my confusion. Shame on me, I guess. I don't know. How about a Yahoo answer? I love that,

165
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:46,560
Griffin. Thank you. Okay, this one was sent in by Colin. Thanks, Colin. It's Yahoo Answers user

166
00:18:46,560 --> 00:18:52,240
ZoraIn who asks, what are other uses for pepperoni?

167
00:18:52,240 --> 00:19:01,280
Pepperoni. I don't have any pizza ingredients.

168
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:06,560
You do have the one.

169
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:12,480
I don't have any pizza ingredients, but I do have a lot of pepperoni.

170
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:20,560
Eyepatch. Stinky eyepatch. Thank you, Travis. Eyepatch is one. Stinky, salty eyepatch. Yes.

171
00:19:20,560 --> 00:19:29,040
Uh, ineffective band-aid. Bad stinky band-aid, yeah. Okay. Bad frisbee. Stinky small bad frisbee,

172
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:33,920
yeah, for sure. Let's, yeah, I mean, let's just knock out all the circular shaped objects. Stinky,

173
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:42,240
stinky pasties. Uh. Ineffective manhole cover.

174
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:48,480
Ineffective manhole cover. You all saw that, right?

175
00:19:53,760 --> 00:20:00,480
We're done. Well, this show's done. We don't need all of it. It's too expensive. We could travel

176
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:07,040
around just two of us at this point. Ineffective manhole cover. You can maybe make like chainmail

177
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:12,800
out of it. Oh, cool. I think so. Technically, it'd be scale mail, but I don't know. Oh, nerd.

178
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:20,880
Oh, you fucking nerd. Go hang out with Frodo. Oh, you could use it as a pizza top. Ah, fuck.

179
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:29,920
Well, we don't know how big the pepperoni is, so that it could be a good frisbee. I don't know.

180
00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:36,000
I was thinking about it. They could make the big pepperoni. If it's a big pepperoni. Yeah.

181
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:40,960
And you could chuck it, and it might work fine. It could be a pizza all its own at that point.

182
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:44,480
That's great. You're halfway there. I love that. I'm about to call Domino's on my phone and be

183
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:47,760
like, let me get a pepperoni pizza. And they're like, sure. And I'm like, no, no, no. Not a

184
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:57,040
pepperonis pizza. I want one big three inch tall pepperoni. I want a Chicago style pepperoni. Yeah.

185
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:04,320
And if you could put some bagel bites on top of it. I want a deep dish pepperoni thin crust

186
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:13,200
pizza. Stuff grouse, please. I want a pepperoni I could do some boogie boarding on down at the ocean.

187
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:22,720
Yamaka. Yamaka. Thank you, Justin. Probably not a good yamaka. No, a stinky yamaka. It's gonna stink

188
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:27,040
no matter what it is. Pizza's the only place you see a pepperoni where you don't think,

189
00:21:27,040 --> 00:21:29,440
what is that stinky meat? Because you're about to eat it.

190
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:34,000
So how many times have you seen just pepperoni random and thought, what is that stink you mean?

191
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:42,560
Yeah. They're breaking news. I just received a text message from Paul from Paul and Storm,

192
00:21:42,560 --> 00:21:46,480
who says, emergency backup pogs. Thank you, Paul.

193
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:55,280
The word emergency there is haunting. Oh no, we have to drop out of the meat. No, hold on. Let me

194
00:21:55,280 --> 00:22:01,280
see what I can find. Oh, give me that pizza. We're gonna save the rec center.

195
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:09,280
I work at a theater. During my breaks, I get a chicken burger.

196
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:15,440
That the kitchen guy graciously puts two patties on, though he's not supposed to. Oh. If only there

197
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:19,280
was a better word for kitchen guy. Yeah, I should probably learn his name, huh? If he's making these

198
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:24,320
awesome chicken burgers. However, three times in a row now, he has forgotten pickles.

199
00:22:26,160 --> 00:22:32,080
I desperately need some of that vinegared veg in my sandwich, or else it is too dry to bear.

200
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:38,640
Should I be grateful for the extra protein, or do I tell him he forgot the pickles? That's for

201
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:48,240
double and nothing. Are you here? Yeah, I don't blame you. Here's the thing, though. Without the

202
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:53,760
wet pickle on top of it, adding another slice of dry chicken burger on top of it actually makes the

203
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:58,560
sandwich worse. I don't know if that's a good idea or not, but I think it's a good idea.

204
00:22:58,560 --> 00:23:03,520
Another slice of dry chicken burger on top of it actually makes the sandwich worse in a lot of ways.

205
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:08,960
It's punishing, yeah. It's a punishment if you think about it. Maybe they ran out of pickles

206
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:14,720
for a while now, and they gave you extra chicken in hopes that you wouldn't notice. It's us chicken.

207
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:20,320
Don't tell my boss I used up all the pickles. That's tiny, stinky frisbees.

208
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:23,920
And ineffective manhole covers. Yeah.

209
00:23:23,920 --> 00:23:30,320
We ran out of pepperonis. The kitchen guy has been siphoning off pickles off the top,

210
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:36,000
and so he's giving you double chicken to make things even out so nobody noticed. The book's

211
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:42,480
still balanced. We're gonna beat this pickle problem between you and me, huh? All right.

212
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:46,720
You got your pickles, remember? Wink, wink, chicken.

213
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:54,000
What's a chicken burger? That's just a chicken sandwich, yes? Or are they making burgers out of

214
00:23:54,000 --> 00:24:09,280
these things these days? Who knows? Millennials. What? In my day, a burger. Let him finish.

215
00:24:09,280 --> 00:24:20,640
No, go ahead. Tell me about it. Stud. Unless. Damn, y'all love pudding and chicken burgers

216
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:26,160
here in Indianapolis. We have gotten the coldest shoulder. How do you feel about pickles?

217
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:35,200
Okay. Pickle capital of Indiana. Yep, that's what I always say when my friends debate me

218
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:42,720
on what the pickle capital of Indiana is. Why don't you- I always say it's Boise,

219
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:47,600
and then they say, that's not in Indiana. Yeah, you've been wrong. You can always

220
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:54,720
drop back and punt with some mayonnaise. The traditional sandwich moistener.

221
00:24:56,880 --> 00:25:03,120
My, we were at the, have you all ever been to the Arby's at the border of Indiana?

222
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:08,320
Yeah. It's like Arby's loves- It's the one with the very racist t-shirts.

223
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:14,640
You know. It takes 45 minutes to make anything. There's also a claw game there for some reason.

224
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:20,880
You know. My, I went to the counter and said, and I ordered my wife's sandwich, and I said,

225
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:26,880
she doesn't want mayonnaise on it, but she would like mustard. And the lady behind the counter said,

226
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:34,240
we don't have mustard. And then she stared blankly for three seconds and said, yes, we do.

227
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:48,160
I don't want the mustard. I just decided then that I don't want the mustard.

228
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:53,760
Whatever it may be, I don't want it. Well, maybe the Arby's, like,

229
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:58,800
Warlock had just finished conjuring it in the back room. Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

230
00:25:58,800 --> 00:26:04,880
I feel the mustard's presence in this Arby's. Now we do. We just saw the tanker roll in.

231
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:10,320
Now we have mustard. The Truman Show style producers just whispered in my ear that I am

232
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:14,960
supposed to tell you we do have mustard. Yes, we do. You've been lowercase p-punked.

233
00:26:17,040 --> 00:26:23,360
She said, she actually said, yes, we do, but we only have spicy brown and honey.

234
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:30,160
So you had two kinds of mustard. Why the subterfuge? It seems unnecessary.

235
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:34,000
And cruel. It was a great sandwich. Sid was real happy about it.

236
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:39,920
They make a good sandwich there and a good t-shirt about how much you do love guns and will

237
00:26:39,920 --> 00:26:46,240
never, ever, ever give them up for no reason whatsoever. There was a shirt there that said,

238
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:51,280
Taylor told me about it. She said, it said, sure, you can date my daughter.

239
00:26:51,280 --> 00:26:58,720
Just let me finish polishing my gun and digging this hole. Huh? Unrelated to you. Yeah, I would

240
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:09,920
love it. I'm burying my gun because it sucks. I just want to be- My gun died. Can we say a few

241
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:14,080
words about my gun, please? I want to meet you and have a conversation with you so I can get

242
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:18,880
to know the person that my daughter is falling in love with. Because she makes her own decisions

243
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:25,520
and I respect that. Yes. I wish I- But this gun, this gun sucks shit. So I'm burying it.

244
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:29,760
I wish I could have been the guy that saw that shirt and I was like, oh, no problem, sir. Just

245
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:34,080
take your time. I'll be back in what, 90 minutes? Okay. I don't know how long it takes to polish

246
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:39,360
a gun and dig a hole. You know what? Let me dig the hole. You polish the gun and then I'll circle

247
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:44,800
back around and have a great date with your daughter. Also, just side note, I'm not a gun

248
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:55,120
owner. Just polishing it, make it shoot better. Well, that's it. When the burglar breaks into

249
00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:59,680
your house and you've got to defend your family, you want him to look at your gun and be like,

250
00:27:59,680 --> 00:28:06,160
damn, that's a clean gun. Because here's the only thing I know about guns and I learned it from

251
00:28:06,160 --> 00:28:11,040
Antiques Roadshow, you got to leave the patina on there. You got to. That's where the money comes

252
00:28:11,040 --> 00:28:15,680
from. When you polish that shit, you lose like 90% of the value. So maybe that's what he's saying.

253
00:28:15,680 --> 00:28:22,240
I'm about to go on Antiques Roadshow and also dig a hole for no reason. No reason. I need a place

254
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:30,560
to put this tiger. Also separate. Also unrelated. Why are you putting a tiger in a hole? For

255
00:28:30,560 --> 00:28:42,800
intruders. The gun is decorative. The gun is decorative, the tiger is practical. I have to

256
00:28:42,800 --> 00:28:52,000
polish my Nerf blaster. All right. Here's a Yahoo that was sent in by Nick K. Thanks,

257
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:56,160
Nick. It's Yahoo Answers user. They are anonymous, so I'm going to call them.

258
00:28:56,160 --> 00:29:08,400
Tabus asks. Tabus? Tabus asks, are clouds alive? Read my opinion and comment on it.

259
00:29:11,680 --> 00:29:18,480
I'm gonna have to hear the opinion. Yeah. Or I can render judgment. That's very mature of you.

260
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:27,120
I'm an old man. Did you know why I believe clouds to be alive? Clearly not. I'm still reading.

261
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:31,520
They possess all the characteristics of organisms.

262
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:36,240
Clouds are organized in the sky. They are white, round, flat, or another shape.

263
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:45,280
Probably not your strongest one to lead with. Yeah, you know, like dogs and cats and cows and

264
00:29:45,280 --> 00:29:50,080
stuff. Like other organisms, they're round or flat. Tabus is giving you the old rope-a-dope

265
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:57,040
here. What a clown. Next point. Metabolism, they absorb water vapor and grow. Now you're like,

266
00:29:57,040 --> 00:30:04,000
oh, shit, wait a minute. Adaptation, they adapt their shape to weather conditions.

267
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:08,800
Response to stimuli, they have their water drops freezing at high altitudes.

268
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:17,120
Reproduction. Okay, Tabus. Clouds like to fuck. They break into smaller clouds when the wind is

269
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:25,920
too strong. The wind likes to fuck clouds. I would also like to point out, Tabus might not

270
00:30:25,920 --> 00:30:30,720
have had the talk yet. If Tabus is like, you know how humans reproduce by breaking into smaller

271
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:42,160
humans? When the wind is way too strong. Whoa, now I'm five small Tabuses. Dang it. Clouds eat

272
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:47,680
water vapors from the atmosphere and reproduce by division like bacteria. Is this the first

273
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:51,680
use of quotes? Because they should have been applied liberally before this point.

274
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:58,000
Although I do not see them as complex forms of life, I believe they are unicellular organisms

275
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:03,040
with water as the genetic material and air as the cytoplasm. I don't know what that means,

276
00:31:03,040 --> 00:31:10,640
Tabus, so you've got me on that one. I feel like this is both very dumb and maybe this

277
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:16,480
person is smarter than I am about what constitutes an organism. Like maybe I would be wrong if I

278
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:23,440
were to criticize them. The only thing, how the flat earthers get you is a good point.

279
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:30,560
The thing is, I'm no scientist. I'm just a humble podcaster. But I'm pretty sure you can't just say

280
00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:35,520
like the cytoplasm, this is the cytoplasm. Or else you'd be like, I'm eating a pizza and I don't

281
00:31:35,520 --> 00:31:40,560
know the sauce. Maybe pizza's an organism. I think we've had this exact conversation before.

282
00:31:40,560 --> 00:31:45,200
Well, I am having very weird... Like the pepperoni of the Golgi bodies. Yes, we said that.

283
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:49,520
Yes, this is definitely a thing that's happened. The thing we've said. Hey, bad news, we've been

284
00:31:49,520 --> 00:31:58,480
doing this show for too long. I'm pretty sure... This adds a whole... I just had my own realization

285
00:31:58,480 --> 00:32:02,560
of if someone says like, that looks like a dog, maybe it's a cloud dog. Ah, damn it.

286
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:09,200
Maybe... And that's why every time that I'm flying and I come in for a landing and we go through

287
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:17,760
a cloud, I hear constant screaming. They're not complex organisms with emotions. They're just

288
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:27,040
simple organisms that eat water for fuel. And shit lightning. This begs the question.

289
00:32:28,800 --> 00:32:34,880
Rain piss or tears? I'm trying to do a joke, but I'm worried Thomas is right and we just sound like

290
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:41,040
assholes. Are we the people who like look at like Play-Doh and shit and we're like, there are no

291
00:32:41,040 --> 00:32:49,040
wet, the sun goes around us, Thomas. Exactly. Why do the clouds have feelings? This is actually too

292
00:32:49,040 --> 00:32:56,240
stressful to continue talking. I live directly across the street, like a 30 second walk out my

293
00:32:56,240 --> 00:33:03,200
front door. We know how big streets are, thank you. It's from a public park that has a splash pad,

294
00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:09,840
which is a big area with things that spray and dump water. I have a sizable lawn that takes

295
00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:16,800
about two hours to mow and trim. After a few hours laboring in my yard, I really want to walk

296
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:24,400
over and cool down. Here's the problem. I think I guessed the problem. I think we've been doing this

297
00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:30,320
a while and you listen to this show and I think I know what the problem is. It's almost exclusively

298
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:35,760
frequented by kids 10 and under. Yep. It's a splash pad. It's a splash, not one of those adult splash

299
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:42,880
pads you've read about for business folk on the go. Is there any way my big sweaty childless 30

300
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:48,080
year old ass can enjoy a few minutes at this neighborhood oasis without looking like a total

301
00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:55,680
creep? No, that's from hotter as hell. Hot as hell in Huntington, Indiana. Are you here?

302
00:33:55,680 --> 00:34:04,400
If you're, hey, the fact that you said ass in this one paragraph long question shows me,

303
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:09,760
probably not. Not with a, not with a potty mouth like that. Can you go play in this splash pad?

304
00:34:10,720 --> 00:34:17,280
Kids are monsters. Yeah. And it's really, there, you will never feel like more of like an alien

305
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:21,200
outsider than to look at a smaller version of human and say, don't splash me.

306
00:34:21,200 --> 00:34:26,720
Please stop. And kids will just like, let's play. And you're like, no, that's cold. I'm doing this

307
00:34:26,720 --> 00:34:32,800
on my terms. You got to understand it is not a, whether or not you have the correct sort of

308
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:37,680
representative there for you, vis a vis, I don't have a child. I do have a child because we go to,

309
00:34:37,680 --> 00:34:42,880
Austin has a lot of like play places in Huntington. We had one called the gym factory, which was just

310
00:34:42,880 --> 00:34:48,080
like a bunch of trampoline floors. And like, imagine like a big, big, big, big, big, big,

311
00:34:48,080 --> 00:34:53,600
bunch of trampoline floors. And like, imagine like a big complex McDonald's play place. They have a

312
00:34:53,600 --> 00:34:58,480
lot of these in Austin. We'll take Henry to those sometimes. And you know, I'll go up with him into

313
00:34:58,480 --> 00:35:04,160
the play place and there's, I'm supposed to be there technically, but I still feel like the

314
00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:09,120
minute tower that is there to challenge the kids and give them riddles or else I'll steal their

315
00:35:09,120 --> 00:35:15,600
bones. There is a look that we just did that we went to the adventure science center in Nashville

316
00:35:15,600 --> 00:35:20,320
and there's like a big, like almost like 10 story tower that kids climb up in the center. And I was

317
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:25,360
following Bibi because she's two and a half and can barely stand. You know that idea of like the

318
00:35:25,360 --> 00:35:31,040
kid, anyways, I didn't want her to die because I'm a good dad. Yeah. And every little kid that would

319
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:38,160
turn around and see me, it's like they were seeing a literal monster. Yeah. And Travis turns to them

320
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:47,440
and says, I've been in here for 23 years. My name is Ricky Scaramouche. My parents left me in 1997.

321
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:55,840
I've been living off crumbs in the garbage. Uh, okay. So let's give some practical. Yes. Here's,

322
00:35:55,840 --> 00:36:01,680
here's my gut instinct. Do dress up like a business person with a briefcase and a Blackberry

323
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:06,000
and just walk absentmindedly through the park into the splash pad and be like, ah, damn it.

324
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:13,520
Ah. As you turn around comically for 20 minutes. For 20 minutes. Ah, we, I mean, shoot. Uh,

325
00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:20,320
and then do this every two weeks. You're going to go through a lot of Blackberries. Yeah.

326
00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:25,280
I guess you could use the same one each time. Yeah. They're not going to check that. They're kids.

327
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:31,520
Something, something, something. Jack disease. Something, something. Thank you, Justin.

328
00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:37,920
Have you, okay, here's what you do. You have a sizable yard. You know the movie Jack? Yeah,

329
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:43,840
sure. That topical, topical, great film. Okay. You have a sizable yard. Benjamin Button. Is that,

330
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:48,240
anyway. You're going to use a portion of your sizable yard and turn into an,

331
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:52,960
into a better splash pad that then will attract the kids away from the splash pad you want to go

332
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:58,400
to. No, fuck that. They've got their own splash pad. You have your own new cool splash pad for

333
00:36:58,400 --> 00:37:02,720
adults. Gift of the Magi though. If you put a splash pad there, you don't have to mow anymore.

334
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:06,240
You're not getting hot. Don't need a splash pad. Don't need a splash pad. You'll have to turn

335
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:10,480
their splash pad into a yard. Yeah. You have to bulldoze the kids' splash pad

336
00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:18,720
to make way for your grown folks' splash pad with beer. It shoots beer out of it. Cool, man.

337
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:25,520
Hell yeah, dude. Very cool. Can you get five friends and all of you cosplay as the cast

338
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:29,120
of friends and then you can play in that splash pad as much as you want.

339
00:37:32,240 --> 00:37:33,440
Cause you're cosplaying.

340
00:37:41,600 --> 00:37:45,760
This just came across. I just got an alert for a haunted doll watch.

341
00:37:47,600 --> 00:37:52,160
Hold on. Wait, did y'all think he was about to do something else? Did y'all think he was about

342
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:58,080
to be like, uh, there was a tornado y'all. We gotta dip. We gotta go. Uh, it's a culturally

343
00:37:58,080 --> 00:38:06,400
tasteless haunted doll watch. Oh good. Did you get it at the truck stop? Y'all know that RB's at the-

344
00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:14,240
Wake up priestess, evil voodoo doll, Elsineth haunted active. Cool and bad so far.

345
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:20,880
They start out with the per eBay policy on my state. This is a tangible item and for

346
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:26,000
entertainment purposes only listed as one tangible voodoo doll that is handmade.

347
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:30,400
It has been reviewed and approved for sale on eBay by eBay. No, it has not.

348
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:38,480
As a tangible item for sale. That's a very quick review process. Let me just. Yep. Cool. Next.

349
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:44,400
You must be over 18 to purchase. You're purchasing one voodoo doll, one candle, not two. Either a

350
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:54,720
votive, either a votive or a taper candle, not both. Five pins. Props and mat not included.

351
00:38:54,720 --> 00:39:01,680
Candle and pin style may vary. So that's the legalese out of the way. This voodoo doll is an

352
00:39:01,680 --> 00:39:08,320
authentic individually handmade by the witches of the coven of Rosen who are witches by birthright.

353
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:18,240
They have not made up some coven. Are these liberals? Or joined one. This is the real deal.

354
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:24,960
And each doll has a unique paranormal dark arts personality. No two are alike. They're real,

355
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:32,080
handmade and not mass produced or made in Japan, China or some foreign country. What the fuck?

356
00:39:32,080 --> 00:39:44,800
Huh? Huh? American jobs. American voodoo dolls. Real witches. Real witches. Real witches. Real

357
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:56,240
America. American voodoo dolls. This is Satan's country. The evidence would indicate yes.

358
00:39:56,240 --> 00:40:02,640
The voodoo doll is a kit. It comes with instructions on how to use and how to close the

359
00:40:02,640 --> 00:40:08,480
paranormal door you will be opening. Thank you for that. Did not know I needed the second one.

360
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:13,920
I'm relieved to know you will be including it. Thank you. These coven of Rosen voodoo dolls are

361
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:20,240
dark arts magic. Make sure you're aware of that. Once you open a door, it's important to close that

362
00:40:20,240 --> 00:40:27,520
door. Maybe you shouldn't be letting me have this doll if these instructions are so specific.

363
00:40:29,360 --> 00:40:34,400
They're individually made so that they're unique and different from each other. Individually made

364
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:44,640
makes them more powerful. Think about it. Okay, now hold on. Over 182 have been sold. Nice.

365
00:40:44,640 --> 00:40:50,560
Seems like a good number of voodoo dolls. You seem like an expert. The coven has held voodoo dolls

366
00:40:50,560 --> 00:40:56,000
like this back for several years. Generations even. However, times in the world have changed.

367
00:40:56,000 --> 00:41:02,800
The rents are getting higher. They feel like that many need the help of these dolls.

368
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:09,840
It can't get much worse out there. Let's release our dolls. You can only get so wet.

369
00:41:09,840 --> 00:41:17,200
Have our poison dolls, everybody. So they have been releasing them and their power is

370
00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:24,160
greater than most voodoo dolls. These dolls do not like their picture taken and often I have to say

371
00:41:24,160 --> 00:41:29,520
please if the pictures are blank or blurry so I can get some fairly good ones to post.

372
00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:36,400
That's much like when I try to take a picture of my kid. Hey, BB. That's wild to say like,

373
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:41,120
hey, voodoo dolls. I know you don't like having your picture taken, but can I so I can sell you

374
00:41:41,120 --> 00:41:51,680
on eBay? Please? Please. This is an all-purpose voodoo doll. Oh, thank god. Oh, shoosh. Used for love,

375
00:41:51,680 --> 00:41:59,600
wealth, good luck, revenge, and more. Here's the instructions for using the doll. Can you

376
00:41:59,600 --> 00:42:03,360
include these with the doll, please, instead of leaving them at eBay listing where I might miss

377
00:42:03,360 --> 00:42:11,440
them anyway. One, first, you can cut out a picture of a person and place it on the face. Second,

378
00:42:11,440 --> 00:42:17,200
if you do not have a picture. Why is that the part that I've said to you, audience? Oh, well now, no.

379
00:42:17,200 --> 00:42:22,400
Second, if you do not have a picture, write their name on a piece of paper, then pin it to the doll.

380
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:26,080
Hey, how bad do you want revenge that you're not gonna fucking get on Facebook?

381
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:32,560
Go get on Facebook. Go buy a fucking printer. Go get some new toner or whatever the shit

382
00:42:32,560 --> 00:42:37,680
and print out a picture to put on your voodoo doll. You already bought the goddamn thing from eBay.

383
00:42:37,680 --> 00:42:43,040
You might as well print out a fucking picture. Jesus. That's what's wrong with America. We don't

384
00:42:43,040 --> 00:42:48,480
make our voodoo dolls. Anyway. It also seems like you print out a picture of Kiefer Sutherland's

385
00:42:48,480 --> 00:42:53,120
face because he knows what he did. You put that on there. He tackled that tree. He tackled that

386
00:42:53,120 --> 00:42:58,160
tree that one time. Holy shit. Google Kiefer Sutherland tackles Christmas tree because nobody

387
00:42:58,160 --> 00:43:04,960
seems to know what that means. It's so good. But if you just write Kiefer on a piece of paper,

388
00:43:04,960 --> 00:43:10,000
every Kiefer on earth is gonna get burned or tickled or whatever the fuck you're gonna do with

389
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:14,720
this doll. Fall in love with you. Fall in love with you, maybe. You can also attach an article

390
00:43:14,720 --> 00:43:21,680
of clothing, hair, or personal item of someone that you wish to see changes in. Love or wealth.

391
00:43:21,680 --> 00:43:31,360
Or you can write what you wish or desire is on paper and pin it to the doll. Then place the doll

392
00:43:31,360 --> 00:43:38,400
on the altar that you make. Okay. See, that's the thing is when you start reading through the

393
00:43:38,400 --> 00:43:43,200
instructions like not included. You gotta go to Home Depot, buy all the altar components,

394
00:43:43,200 --> 00:43:52,160
your raven bones. It can be on a dresser, table, or somewhere where the doll is the focus. Next,

395
00:43:52,160 --> 00:43:57,520
put a circle of salt around the doll and offerings before you begin to keep the spirits from leaving

396
00:43:57,520 --> 00:44:02,320
the doll and entering your home or person. Hey, as long as you're giving me motherfucking step-by-step

397
00:44:02,320 --> 00:44:08,480
instructions, could you maybe hit me to what some offerings might be I could give instead of just

398
00:44:08,480 --> 00:44:14,000
saying the word offerings? Talk to the doll. Use its name as if you're addressing a person when

399
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:19,280
requesting something. State your request. Be brief and to the point. Do not linger on and on. Is this

400
00:44:19,280 --> 00:44:24,800
how to get a job? Yeah, I was about to say. Make eye contact. Write a thank you note. When you are

401
00:44:24,800 --> 00:44:30,000
done, light a black candle, which is included, to get rid of any residual negative energy.

402
00:44:30,640 --> 00:44:34,720
Stating one of the following choices. One, that you were lighting the candle to ward off evil

403
00:44:34,720 --> 00:44:38,880
spirits. Two, ridding yourself of slander, reversing or removing hexes, neutralizing

404
00:44:38,880 --> 00:44:43,040
another's magic, removing or reversing very powerful negative energy from who the doll is

405
00:44:43,040 --> 00:44:52,640
being used for. Three, thanking for your personal request. Each doll is good to use on one person

406
00:44:52,640 --> 00:45:00,720
only and preferably only one time. I think I figured out how you sold 182 of these.

407
00:45:00,720 --> 00:45:07,440
How to dispose of the doll. Fuck. To get rid of the doll, do not burn it.

408
00:45:14,320 --> 00:45:20,240
Bind it with red thread. Bless the doll with holy water and bury it somewhere off of your property.

409
00:45:21,680 --> 00:45:26,800
Hey, this is Justin McElroy. Is this the Arby's at the border of Indiana that has the

410
00:45:26,800 --> 00:45:33,120
Arby's? Love's shop stop there. I figure things can't get much worse there and I was wondering

411
00:45:33,120 --> 00:45:42,320
if I could bury a voodoo doll there on your property. There is a poem. Stop? What?

412
00:45:45,440 --> 00:45:51,920
Her name is Elsineth. Give her offerings of ears of corn, boiled eggs and cheese. Okay, there it is.

413
00:45:51,920 --> 00:45:57,520
Thank you. In a plate, give her some cake. Give her some red grapes and oranges. She likes gold

414
00:45:57,520 --> 00:46:02,960
objects. It's sounding like a lot of work at this. She has fond red scarves, so give her one. I'll

415
00:46:02,960 --> 00:46:12,880
just murder the person. She likes money and don't be cheap. But how much is that? Light some tobacco

416
00:46:12,880 --> 00:46:20,880
for her. Any kind. Nice. She likes rum, water and beer. She kicks ass. She likes the party. Me and

417
00:46:20,880 --> 00:46:27,440
this doll like all the same shit. She loves memes. Yeah, she likes Pokemon. Her favorite color is pink

418
00:46:27,440 --> 00:46:35,680
and sky blue. Her favorite number is nine. She likes Saturday. So she likes Saturday. Is that

419
00:46:35,680 --> 00:46:39,760
the day I should ask her to kill Keefer Sutherland or the day I should wrap her in red twine and

420
00:46:39,760 --> 00:46:48,320
bury her at the Arby's? What would she prefer? There's another 5,000 words about this doll.

421
00:46:48,320 --> 00:47:00,160
I literally can't. Okay, there's an FAQ. Question 18. Are they made by real generational witches?

422
00:47:00,160 --> 00:47:23,680
Answer, yes. So that's the... That's fantastic. Hey everybody, this is a very smoky voiced

423
00:47:23,680 --> 00:47:30,000
Griffin McElroy. Not smoky from smoke. You know I keep it straight edge. Just sort of smoky from

424
00:47:30,880 --> 00:47:36,480
yelling about nerd shit because we just got back from our book tour. Final stop at San Diego Comic

425
00:47:36,480 --> 00:47:42,400
Con. We had a great old time. Thanks to everybody who came out and supported the book. I think maybe

426
00:47:42,400 --> 00:47:48,560
if you buy Rockport today, it still counts towards first week sales, which I have come to understand

427
00:47:48,560 --> 00:47:53,840
is kind of important. But I'm not here to bullshit you about our garbage. I'm here to talk about

428
00:47:53,840 --> 00:47:58,160
other companies. I almost called it garbage. It's not. It's good stuff. Like Stitch Fix for instance

429
00:47:58,800 --> 00:48:03,440
is really good stuff. They sell you clothes. Well, at first they send you the clothes. They send you

430
00:48:03,440 --> 00:48:07,280
the clothes in the box. The selling comes after because you try on all this stuff. A personal

431
00:48:07,280 --> 00:48:12,000
stylist is going to like pick out stuff that's going to look really good on your fucking bod

432
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:17,040
and you're going to slap it on there. And if you agree with the stylist's fashion choices,

433
00:48:17,040 --> 00:48:21,840
then you can keep it and you pay for it. And then anything you don't want, you ship on back for free.

434
00:48:21,840 --> 00:48:26,560
And there's, there is a $20 styling fee, but check this. It goes right towards anything you keep from

435
00:48:26,560 --> 00:48:32,560
your box. And if you keep everything from your box, when you go to stitchfix.com slash my brother,

436
00:48:32,560 --> 00:48:40,160
you'll get 25% off if you keep all the items in the box. And I am a Stitch Fix user myself. And

437
00:48:40,160 --> 00:48:45,200
more often than not, I do exactly that because they've really, they've really got me dialed in.

438
00:48:45,200 --> 00:48:51,520
They really know the curvature of my bod and my shape and stuff. So that's stitchfix.com slash

439
00:48:51,520 --> 00:48:56,240
my brother. Stitchfix.com slash my brother. Get 25% off when you keep everything in your box.

440
00:48:57,200 --> 00:49:00,640
And much like these clothes are going to fit your bod, Bowling Branch has something that's

441
00:49:00,640 --> 00:49:07,760
going to fit your bed, which almost rhymes. No, it's not a rhyme. It's a slant rhyme or something.

442
00:49:08,320 --> 00:49:11,440
Okay. It's not any kind of rhyme, but Bowling Branch is going to give you all kinds of great

443
00:49:11,440 --> 00:49:16,240
sheets that you are going to use to, well, you're going to sleep on them most of the time. Do not

444
00:49:16,240 --> 00:49:20,560
cut holes in them to make a ghost. These, I mean, you can do that if you want, but these are really

445
00:49:20,560 --> 00:49:26,880
nice quality sheets. You're not going to want to cut holes in them unless I guess it is Halloween

446
00:49:26,880 --> 00:49:32,880
and you are hard pressed for fabric. Everything that they make is designed with your comfort in

447
00:49:32,880 --> 00:49:39,440
mind from their pure 100% organic cotton signature soft sheets, their cozy throws to their plush

448
00:49:39,440 --> 00:49:45,600
towels. Bowling Branch products have thousands of five-star reviews and people are at the heart of

449
00:49:45,600 --> 00:49:49,360
everything that they do from the farmers who grow their organic cotton to the people who sleep on

450
00:49:49,360 --> 00:49:54,480
their sheets at night. They have a no risk 30-day trial and free shipping in the US. You can return

454
00:50:10,080 --> 00:50:14,880
That's BowlingBranch.com. Promo code my brother. If Justin was here, he would make some gag about

455
00:50:14,880 --> 00:50:18,560
how the company's name is confusing. I think it's a good company name. So Bowling Branch,

456
00:50:18,560 --> 00:50:24,000
just go ahead and write those checks directly to me, but that's not really how any of this works.

457
00:50:24,880 --> 00:50:29,920
I'm going to let you get back to the live show where we like Travis and dad are still gone. So

458
00:50:29,920 --> 00:50:34,640
we did not have time to record an episode. So I hope you enjoy this one that we recorded from our

459
00:50:34,640 --> 00:50:40,400
recent tour in Indianapolis. Yeah, and again, one last time, thanks to everybody who has supported

460
00:50:40,400 --> 00:50:45,680
the book, the second graphic novel in our adaptation of the Adventure Zone Balance.

461
00:50:45,680 --> 00:50:50,960
You can find it wherever. Go to theadventurezonecomic.com if you want. It is, I mean,

462
00:50:50,960 --> 00:50:55,120
anytime we get out and get to see folks and say hi, it's always like a very humbling experience.

463
00:50:55,120 --> 00:51:01,040
And this week was just chock full of those. So thank you all so much. And yeah, we'll be back

464
00:51:01,040 --> 00:51:08,560
with a regular episode of my Bim Bam next week. So see you then. The Greatest Generation is a

465
00:51:08,560 --> 00:51:15,040
Star Trek podcast that de-stigmatizes the very idea of having a Star Trek podcast.

466
00:51:16,080 --> 00:51:20,560
We're Ben and Adam, the hosts of The Greatest Generation. And the technology we've developed

467
00:51:20,560 --> 00:51:25,280
is that nobody knows what you're playing in your earbuds. You know, with legalization,

468
00:51:25,280 --> 00:51:31,200
it's easier than ever to find out what's in your buds. But we suggest that you legally

469
00:51:31,760 --> 00:51:36,160
find The Greatest Generation wherever you download your podcasts. We'll send it to you

470
00:51:36,160 --> 00:51:42,960
in a discreet, unmarked package that nobody has to know but us. That's The Greatest Generation,

471
00:51:42,960 --> 00:51:48,080
the Star Trek podcast that you didn't know you needed yet makes you feel like you belong.

472
00:51:48,080 --> 00:51:54,720
Uh, hello. Hi. I think everybody ended up over there. That's fine. What's your name?

473
00:51:54,720 --> 00:52:00,160
This is Annalise. Hi, Annalise. Your question, uh, delighted us.

474
00:52:02,720 --> 00:52:07,360
So my neighbor, I just moved to Indiana. I'm not really familiar with the traditions here.

475
00:52:07,360 --> 00:52:11,120
Welcome. Hey, straight up. They fucking love pudding.

476
00:52:11,120 --> 00:52:21,120
So my neighbor, a delightful man, he likes to throw old pieces of pizza into his backyard,

477
00:52:23,760 --> 00:52:27,600
including also doughnuts, bread and tortilla chips.

478
00:52:27,600 --> 00:52:30,400
You know those aren't pizza traditionally. Those are different food.

479
00:52:31,760 --> 00:52:36,160
Do they have pepperonis on them? Yeah, actually. The issue is that my

480
00:52:36,160 --> 00:52:43,120
dogs run over and eat them and then a few weeks ago there was a possum eating all of the pizza

481
00:52:43,120 --> 00:52:50,240
and I had to fight it. I had to pull my dogs away. Stop the podcast. One,

482
00:52:50,240 --> 00:52:52,640
possums are great. They take care of a lot of pests.

483
00:52:54,560 --> 00:52:59,200
No way. Two, why on earth did you fight the possum, Annalise?

484
00:52:59,200 --> 00:53:03,440
Well, it wasn't so much fighting it as like dragging my dogs back and screaming at the

485
00:53:03,440 --> 00:53:06,880
possum to get away. Oh, okay. You had to harass the possum.

486
00:53:06,880 --> 00:53:07,840
Yeah. Okay.

487
00:53:10,240 --> 00:53:16,960
If not, okay, if your neighbor's not throwing it there for possums, then why?

488
00:53:16,960 --> 00:53:20,000
I don't know. Is it for giant birds?

489
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:24,640
I don't, it's attracting coyotes too because some coyotes killed my neighbor's ducks and

490
00:53:24,640 --> 00:53:28,320
left the head on my lawn. That's a huge fucking bummer.

491
00:53:28,320 --> 00:53:36,000
So your neighbor hates pets. But loves non-pet animals and is trying to

492
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:39,200
come to some sort of equilibrium in the neighborhood.

493
00:53:39,200 --> 00:53:44,400
Is your neighbor trying to seduce your dogs to be his dogs?

494
00:53:44,400 --> 00:53:49,280
Now, he's the one who throws them all pizza. He's the one who really cares for us.

495
00:53:49,280 --> 00:53:53,040
Yeah. Is your neighbor a coyote?

496
00:53:53,040 --> 00:53:59,520
Throwing the most radical house party ever. Brothers, come sup from the bounty.

497
00:54:00,240 --> 00:54:05,040
I shall continue to live as one of them so that you may feast.

498
00:54:05,040 --> 00:54:11,200
I have made contact with the Papa John. He sucks shit.

499
00:54:11,200 --> 00:54:18,240
He sucks, but his pizza's pretty good. Comparatively, Decarian.

500
00:54:18,240 --> 00:54:25,760
Uh, have you addressed? Papa John's pizza, better than deadly.

501
00:54:25,760 --> 00:54:30,480
Yeah. Have you addressed, have you met your neighbor?

502
00:54:30,480 --> 00:54:33,040
Oh, yeah, my neighbor. You're ahead of the curve, I think.

503
00:54:33,040 --> 00:54:35,040
What's his full name? No.

504
00:54:35,040 --> 00:54:40,800
Sorry. Have you said, hey, why do you throw pizza

505
00:54:40,800 --> 00:54:44,320
out in the yard? Because of you, a dog died.

506
00:54:44,320 --> 00:54:48,640
That seems like a pretty good way to make most-

507
00:54:48,640 --> 00:54:50,640
It was a duck. It was a duck.

508
00:54:50,640 --> 00:54:52,640
I thought you said dachshund. No, no, no, no. I'm sorry.

509
00:54:52,640 --> 00:54:54,720
It was two ducks. Oh, that's fine then.

510
00:54:54,720 --> 00:55:00,000
Yeah. Because the ducks could have flown away.

511
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:08,320
As we all know, one dog equals 30 ducks. I mean, you're just going to have to go

512
00:55:08,320 --> 00:55:13,120
over there and grab the pizza out of the air as he throws.

513
00:55:13,120 --> 00:55:18,960
Is it, he throws it into the yard? Yeah, yeah.

514
00:55:18,960 --> 00:55:22,080
Is he trying to grow a pizza tree? Thank you, Travis.

515
00:55:22,080 --> 00:55:26,880
Is he composting, perchance? In the shittiest, worst way imaginable.

516
00:55:26,880 --> 00:55:30,960
He's not the composting type. No, he's more of the throw pizza in the

517
00:55:30,960 --> 00:55:34,240
yard and a coyote kills a duck type. You know.

518
00:55:34,240 --> 00:55:37,040
I don't know what- Every neighborhood has one.

519
00:55:37,040 --> 00:55:41,120
I don't know what not the composting type means, but I bet they frequent the

520
00:55:41,120 --> 00:55:45,040
Arby's racist t-shirt store.

521
00:55:46,720 --> 00:55:53,120
Uh, Annalise, here's what I would do. Ignore it. Here's what Funny Me would do.

522
00:55:53,120 --> 00:55:56,880
Pick up the pizza and just chuck it back at him.

523
00:55:56,880 --> 00:56:00,000
Nice. It's back on my doorstep? How is this possible?

524
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:03,520
It was meant to be- I'm moving away in a month, so-

525
00:56:03,520 --> 00:56:07,280
Why are you wasting our time?

526
00:56:07,280 --> 00:56:12,160
Does that help? Yes, thank you. Thank you. Excellent.

527
00:56:12,160 --> 00:56:14,560
Hello.

528
00:56:16,400 --> 00:56:21,840
Over here. Hello, what's your name? Hi, I'm Grayson. Hi, Grayson.

529
00:56:21,840 --> 00:56:25,280
What's up? Sorry.

530
00:56:25,280 --> 00:56:28,400
Which question did you pick? Oh, did you send in multiple?

531
00:56:28,400 --> 00:56:32,000
I asked you why. The one about your dad? You had a question about your dad's-

532
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:35,680
My dad has a terrible vape rig. How can I fix it?

533
00:56:35,680 --> 00:56:37,920
Sure.

534
00:56:38,080 --> 00:56:43,360
Happy Father's Day, Dad. Is he here? Is he here?

535
00:56:43,360 --> 00:56:46,080
Oh my god!

536
00:56:46,080 --> 00:56:48,080
Hey!

537
00:56:48,800 --> 00:56:53,120
Can you put a hand up, bad vape dad? I see you. Grayson's dad.

538
00:56:53,120 --> 00:56:56,960
Fix your busted rig. Your busted ass vape sucks.

539
00:56:56,960 --> 00:57:00,560
You're embarrassing Grayson. You're getting minimum ohm.

540
00:57:00,560 --> 00:57:06,480
Grayson, what's your dad's full name?

541
00:57:06,960 --> 00:57:10,240
Grayson, I don't want to put your dad's full name on blast. He's probably got a job.

542
00:57:10,240 --> 00:57:13,920
Yeah. He does. So your dad has a- and this is

543
00:57:13,920 --> 00:57:18,080
your question that you sent to us, quote, garbage vape rig.

544
00:57:18,080 --> 00:57:21,520
Is it garbage in the fact that he's just blowing out the most pathetic wispy

545
00:57:21,520 --> 00:57:26,160
bullshit ever or- Is it really loud?

546
00:57:26,160 --> 00:57:30,320
Is it technically an asthma inhaler?

547
00:57:30,320 --> 00:57:34,160
He keeps calling it a pipe.

548
00:57:34,240 --> 00:57:38,400
I mean, is it, yeah, I mean, is it dangerous? Does it get

549
00:57:38,400 --> 00:57:42,000
very hot or something? Is it leaking? Why is it

550
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:46,880
so bad? It's, one, it's like five or six years old. It's a very old vape.

551
00:57:46,880 --> 00:57:50,560
Wow, early adopter of vape technology. I'm into it.

552
00:57:50,560 --> 00:57:53,600
Listen, our podcast is nine years old. There's nothing wrong with things that

553
00:57:53,600 --> 00:57:56,480
are old. Next.

554
00:57:56,480 --> 00:58:00,560
That, too, it's very beat up. Like, he has not taken- That's a look.

555
00:58:00,560 --> 00:58:04,320
You got it. Listen, Grayson's dad, take that to Antiques Roadshow. Do not

556
00:58:04,320 --> 00:58:07,520
polish the feet off.

557
00:58:07,520 --> 00:58:12,560
It's so important to leave- This vape rig is from, what, 2013.

558
00:58:12,560 --> 00:58:18,720
Whoa, that's got to be at least $20.

559
00:58:18,720 --> 00:58:22,560
I'm the one that kind of looks like Paul F. Duncan. Tell me something that's

560
00:58:22,560 --> 00:58:26,320
wrong with this rig because so far I'm on your dad's side.

561
00:58:26,320 --> 00:58:30,480
With his kick-ass vintage rig.

562
00:58:30,960 --> 00:58:35,920
Buddy Holly used to use a vape rig just like this one.

563
00:58:35,920 --> 00:58:40,400
Star Wars Episode VII branding. Tell me about this busted rig.

564
00:58:40,400 --> 00:58:45,040
It's- How big is it? Like, uh, like, I don't know, an inch by two inches by

565
00:58:45,040 --> 00:58:47,760
three inches. Is it a lightsaber or one of them squares?

566
00:58:47,760 --> 00:58:50,800
It's not a square. It's like a big chunky square.

567
00:58:50,800 --> 00:58:54,960
Nice. Yeah. I can't get behind. I don't like the ones that look like you're

568
00:58:54,960 --> 00:58:59,920
sucking on a talk boy. I like the lightsabers. He's practically

569
00:58:59,920 --> 00:59:03,200
sucking a carry, like, a PC he carries around. That's

570
00:59:03,200 --> 00:59:06,880
nice. Nice. It's like a little iPad.

571
00:59:06,880 --> 00:59:12,640
Uh, I mean, hey, it's Father's Day. Thank you. That would have been a great gift.

572
00:59:12,640 --> 00:59:17,280
Go to bottom one, yeah. Go to bottom one. I'm sorry we can't help you. Does that

573
00:59:17,280 --> 00:59:19,520
help?

574
00:59:19,520 --> 00:59:22,320
Thank you.

575
00:59:22,320 --> 00:59:25,360
I got my dad six vape rigs for Father's Day.

576
00:59:25,360 --> 00:59:30,960
He doesn't vape. Yeah. Should I get him the Jimmy Buffett ones? Well, yeah, that

577
00:59:30,960 --> 00:59:33,280
goes without saying. Those are filled with weed,

578
00:59:33,280 --> 00:59:36,240
so if you want your dad to chill out, absolutely.

579
00:59:36,240 --> 00:59:44,160
Yes. Does that help? Yes, absolutely. Thank you. Thank you. My pleasure.

580
00:59:44,160 --> 00:59:48,160
Over here. How's it going? Good. How are you?

581
00:59:48,160 --> 00:59:51,360
I'm all right. What's your name? Cool. My name is Brandon.

582
00:59:51,360 --> 00:59:55,280
Brandon, hello. Your question, please. Did you also send in multiples?

583
00:59:55,280 --> 00:59:59,520
No, I only sent in one. Okay. Almost a month ago to the day

584
00:59:59,520 --> 01:00:05,200
on my birthday. Yes. My car was stolen in front of my apartment complex,

585
01:00:05,200 --> 01:00:10,560
and so my question to you guys is how, besides putting jelly under the handle,

586
01:00:10,560 --> 01:00:14,720
would I make my car less attractive to thieves? Well, you already

587
01:00:14,720 --> 01:00:19,120
answered it, so thanks, Brandon.

588
01:00:19,120 --> 01:00:25,040
Boy, that's rough. On your birthday, huh? Yeah.

589
01:00:25,040 --> 01:00:30,960
I hate to hear that. Kind of like the ducks being eaten by coyotes

590
01:00:30,960 --> 01:00:36,400
version of birthday activities. Maybe like a really embarrassing

591
01:00:36,400 --> 01:00:39,600
novelty license plate that just says like,

592
01:00:39,600 --> 01:00:47,440
dumb car. Yeah, that's cool. Yeah. Or a license plate that says stolen.

593
01:00:48,640 --> 01:00:53,440
Now this one's going to raise some eyebrows before it's stolen.

594
01:00:53,440 --> 01:00:58,960
Big spoiler. Giant spoiler. Four feet wide.

595
01:00:58,960 --> 01:01:05,760
Eyes across the back of it. No, like a, what? Okay, I see. Yeah, it's very funny.

596
01:01:05,760 --> 01:01:12,000
So could you just make it your car? Yeah, you're a stinker.

597
01:01:13,040 --> 01:01:16,400
It may be too late for this, but can you make your next vehicle

598
01:01:16,400 --> 01:01:20,800
a PT Cruiser? Because I'm pretty sure nobody's going to want to

599
01:01:20,800 --> 01:01:24,400
fuck with that. I don't know. There might be a large market for those, so.

600
01:01:24,400 --> 01:01:29,280
Nope. Pretty sure there's not. I demonstrably know.

601
01:01:29,280 --> 01:01:31,520
Yeah.

602
01:01:31,520 --> 01:01:36,960
Fish. Wait, is it a big thing in Indiana to drive PT Cruisers?

603
01:01:36,960 --> 01:01:41,120
What the fuck is up with this state?

604
01:01:43,920 --> 01:01:47,520
Okay, take your word for it. Fine. And you love PT Cruisers.

605
01:01:47,520 --> 01:01:51,760
Okay. What a wild place. Have you thought about buying the exact same car

606
01:01:51,760 --> 01:01:55,040
that has already been stolen, so then probably the same person comes back to

607
01:01:55,040 --> 01:01:59,760
steal? They're like, what? I already got one. Or they'll think like,

608
01:01:59,760 --> 01:02:03,600
didn't I already steal that fucking car? What the fuck? I know exactly how to

609
01:02:03,600 --> 01:02:08,000
steal this car. Excellent. This is wonderful.

610
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:13,760
Did you leave it unlocked? No. That's good. It's a good start.

611
01:02:13,760 --> 01:02:17,520
That was actually going to be my one is to lock it, but you already locked it.

612
01:02:17,520 --> 01:02:20,960
Because for me, when the thief comes up and tries to open the door and it doesn't

613
01:02:20,960 --> 01:02:24,080
and they walk away, that's a pretty good way to make your car less attractive to

614
01:02:24,080 --> 01:02:27,680
thieves. Yeah, certainly. Maybe uncomfortable seats.

615
01:02:27,680 --> 01:02:32,880
Yeah, I would have tried that. I know you would have. You're asking about

616
01:02:32,880 --> 01:02:37,760
what to do next time, and I'm saying uncomfortable seats. Did you do

617
01:02:37,760 --> 01:02:42,400
jelly on the handle in the first place? Raspberry, but he liked it.

618
01:02:42,400 --> 01:02:47,680
Damn it. That was a joke, Brandon. I'm mad at you.

619
01:02:47,680 --> 01:02:51,280
That was a joke and not serious, and you didn't put the jelly there and your car

620
01:02:51,280 --> 01:02:55,120
got stolen, and I hope you've all learned something today.

621
01:02:55,120 --> 01:02:58,800
Don't be like Brandon, who's now become a symbol

622
01:02:58,800 --> 01:03:03,280
rather than a listener. He's become a cautionary tale

623
01:03:03,280 --> 01:03:06,960
of what happens when you don't put jelly on your car. I have

624
01:03:06,960 --> 01:03:11,200
one simple answer, a way to make your car less attractive to thieves.

625
01:03:11,200 --> 01:03:16,720
You're always in it. Always. Always in it. And also you have a burglar mask pulled

626
01:03:16,720 --> 01:03:22,080
on over your head, and you're like, keep moving, buddy.

627
01:03:22,080 --> 01:03:28,400
Warning, this car is actually turbo teen, and if you, and after some period of time,

628
01:03:28,400 --> 01:03:31,920
it will transform into a teenager that you will have stolen.

629
01:03:31,920 --> 01:03:35,920
Does that help at all? Yes, somewhat. All right, thank you. Fair enough.

630
01:03:35,920 --> 01:03:41,040
No, fair. You fucked up. You should have put the jelly on, not me.

631
01:03:41,040 --> 01:03:44,320
That's a nice thing to say to someone as they're walking away. I'm just saying, put

632
01:03:44,320 --> 01:03:48,800
the jelly on next time, Brandon. Hello. Hi, what's your name? It should be

633
01:03:48,800 --> 01:03:51,520
an insurance thing. Thank you, yes. Hello, what's your name?

634
01:03:51,520 --> 01:03:56,800
Shawn. Hi, Shawn. What is your question, Shawn? Okay, I work in an adult novelty

635
01:03:56,800 --> 01:03:59,040
store. Okay, can you get a little bit closer to the mic?

636
01:03:59,040 --> 01:04:03,920
Just a little bit closer. Thank you. Okay, so I sell dildos and vibrators. That's

637
01:04:03,920 --> 01:04:07,840
what I do. I figured that was part of the inventory.

638
01:04:07,840 --> 01:04:10,880
And I do like the way you phrased that too, because it's almost like you would

639
01:04:10,880 --> 01:04:16,320
say it from like, I sell dildos and vibrators. It's what I do.

640
01:04:16,320 --> 01:04:24,880
It is. My question is, how do I politely ask people to not laugh at the 17-inch

641
01:04:24,880 --> 01:04:31,120
dildos that we sell? It's not funny. It's not funny. You all

642
01:04:31,120 --> 01:04:35,360
just laughed. You failed. This is a very serious

643
01:04:35,360 --> 01:04:41,680
practical. Those are American-made dildos. Business dildos for serious

644
01:04:41,680 --> 01:04:46,880
purposes. Non-comedic in nature.

645
01:04:46,880 --> 01:04:51,280
Let me ask you a question, Shawn. Do they have a funny name? Be honest.

646
01:04:51,280 --> 01:05:00,240
They're called the Dick Rambone. Okay, well.

647
01:05:00,400 --> 01:05:03,680
All right, let's devil's advocate this one.

648
01:05:03,680 --> 01:05:09,680
If I went to a funeral parlor to pick out my own coffin, and they're like,

649
01:05:09,680 --> 01:05:14,480
well, we have this 30-foot long coffin. I would laugh at that, because that's not

650
01:05:14,480 --> 01:05:19,840
what size coffins usually are. I have, I have. And if they said it's

651
01:05:19,840 --> 01:05:23,520
called the Dick Rambone.

652
01:05:23,840 --> 01:05:27,840
If you want people to stop laughing at the 17-inch dildos,

653
01:05:27,840 --> 01:05:32,000
you need to start selling 18-inch dildos. Yeah.

654
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:38,880
I mean, you think that's funny? Look at this.

655
01:05:38,880 --> 01:05:44,880
It's slightly bigger, though admittedly thinner. It's the same amount of material,

656
01:05:44,880 --> 01:05:48,320
but spread out over 18 inches instead of 17.

657
01:05:48,320 --> 01:05:57,680
They're all like that. Eventually, it just looks like a windshield wiper.

658
01:05:58,960 --> 01:06:03,200
Do these, do these same people walk through the inventory of your store like

659
01:06:03,200 --> 01:06:05,600
laughing at multiples? Are they laughing because,

660
01:06:05,600 --> 01:06:09,200
and be brutally honest here, are they laughing because it's a sex thing, or

661
01:06:09,200 --> 01:06:14,560
are they laughing because it is a 17-inch hog?

662
01:06:15,120 --> 01:06:20,240
Um, both actually. Some people, you know, you get your freshly 18-year-olds in,

663
01:06:20,240 --> 01:06:24,000
and they're, it's sex, so they think it's the funniest thing in the world.

664
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:27,120
Right. So what you're really asking is how to get people to stop from laughing

665
01:06:27,120 --> 01:06:30,560
at any size dildo. They haven't been walking through somber,

666
01:06:30,560 --> 01:06:35,280
and then they get to the 17-inch dildo, and they're like, now wait a second!

667
01:06:35,280 --> 01:06:39,840
Right. Now what's even happening here? They see an average-sized dildo, and

668
01:06:39,840 --> 01:06:45,200
they're like, yes. Right. Correct. Just right. Perfect.

669
01:06:45,200 --> 01:06:51,280
Uh, notice how I said average-sized dildo there because I didn't want to embarrass myself.

670
01:06:51,280 --> 01:07:05,200
Oh boy, you could tell me anything right now, and I'd, I'd believe you.

671
01:07:05,200 --> 01:07:12,160
We actually sell a product called the 24-inch anal snake as well.

672
01:07:12,160 --> 01:07:18,160
Snake? No! Hold up, hold up, hold up. Is it penis-shaped or snake-shaped?

673
01:07:18,160 --> 01:07:26,720
It's snake-shaped. Then that's just a big snake.

674
01:07:26,720 --> 01:07:31,520
They might be laughing at that just of the poor branding.

675
01:07:31,520 --> 01:07:35,760
If they see the 17-inch dildo after the 24-inch snake, they're gonna think the

676
01:07:35,760 --> 01:07:40,080
17-inch one is also a snake, so maybe it's shock that it's not

677
01:07:40,080 --> 01:07:44,640
is why they're laughing. Or maybe it's relief.

678
01:07:44,640 --> 01:07:50,240
Thank god. I was afraid they were all snakes.

679
01:07:51,280 --> 01:07:55,040
Can you hang a sign? My cousin's not gonna like that. It's for a bachelorette.

680
01:07:55,040 --> 01:07:58,480
Sure, sure. Can you hang a sign in that section of the store saying,

681
01:07:58,480 --> 01:08:04,480
no laughing aloud? This is serious. Maybe make them promise before you show it.

682
01:08:04,480 --> 01:08:08,400
Yeah. Do you promise you won't laugh? Oh shit, that's good. Bust out a big 17-inch

683
01:08:08,400 --> 01:08:12,000
briefcase that you plop up on the table like you're a black arms dealer.

684
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:18,400
It's chained to your wrist? Yeah. Do you sell what you would classify as a

685
01:08:18,400 --> 01:08:21,600
funny dildo, though?

686
01:08:21,920 --> 01:08:29,280
We have a glittery one. Okay, that's... You've lost perspective.

687
01:08:29,280 --> 01:08:38,640
Sean, does that help? It works wonders. Thank you. Thank you, Sean. Thank you so much.

688
01:08:38,640 --> 01:08:42,080
All right, that's gonna do it. Can we get the house lights turned off, please?

689
01:08:42,080 --> 01:08:46,400
It's very intimidating. Thank you. That was very fast.

690
01:08:46,400 --> 01:08:50,240
Y'all, this has been so wonderful. Thank you, Indianapolis. Y'all have been a

691
01:08:50,240 --> 01:08:54,000
delight.

692
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:56,960
Well, you want to say thank you to a whole bunch of people.

693
01:08:56,960 --> 01:09:00,720
First, if you didn't already, I don't know if they're still selling or not, but

694
01:09:00,720 --> 01:09:04,560
Evan Palmer did a really, really cool poster for us based on the Become the

695
01:09:04,560 --> 01:09:07,920
Monster kind of tour. It's really, really awesome.

696
01:09:07,920 --> 01:09:10,720
If they're still selling them, grab one. And if they're not,

697
01:09:10,720 --> 01:09:14,720
sucks to be you. Yeah. We also want to say thank you to Sawbones.

698
01:09:14,720 --> 01:09:17,040
Yes.

699
01:09:17,760 --> 01:09:22,960
And to Travis and Paul for dropping back and punting on that one.

700
01:09:22,960 --> 01:09:28,880
You did a great job. And Teresa, I hope you feel better real soon.

701
01:09:28,880 --> 01:09:33,200
We also want to say a very, very special thank you to our dad, Clint McRae. It is

702
01:09:33,200 --> 01:09:37,840
Father's Day. Happy Father's Day, daddy.

703
01:09:37,840 --> 01:09:41,200
We love him very, very much. We would not be who we are without him.

704
01:09:41,200 --> 01:09:44,160
And just count of three, let's all sing the Happy Father's Day song. One, two,

705
01:09:44,160 --> 01:09:46,960
three. Probably something Steely Dan. Right. It's

706
01:09:46,960 --> 01:09:49,920
no, it was wrong. You're wrong. It was it was pegged by Steely Dan. You guys were

707
01:09:49,920 --> 01:09:53,760
all wrong. We also want to say, we just said thank

708
01:09:53,760 --> 01:09:57,200
you to Paul and Paul's and Warren of Paul and Storm. Not just for the worst

709
01:09:57,200 --> 01:10:02,400
for Chad, but for being our tour manager. Yes. Thank you.

710
01:10:02,400 --> 01:10:08,800
To Clues Theater. Is that right? Yeah, we said it right. Let's see.

711
01:10:08,800 --> 01:10:12,400
Thank you to all of you. Thank you to Max Fun, our home. Thank you

712
01:10:12,400 --> 01:10:14,960
to John Roderick in the Long Winter. Should you write a theme song instead

713
01:10:14,960 --> 01:10:18,400
of part your album, Putting the Days to Bend?

714
01:10:18,400 --> 01:10:21,280
If you're looking for dining recommendations on the way home, I would

715
01:10:21,280 --> 01:10:25,840
suggest the Arby's on the Indiana board.

716
01:10:25,840 --> 01:10:30,240
Here is our final Yahoo answer that was sent in by a lot of people. Thank you

717
01:10:30,240 --> 01:10:34,080
everybody. It's from an anonymous Yahoo Answers user who I'm going to call

718
01:10:34,080 --> 01:10:38,080
Jerrsh.

719
01:10:38,080 --> 01:10:47,440
Jerrsh asks, at what age should I lose my vinegar?

720
01:10:50,160 --> 01:10:53,680
My name is Justin McElroy. I'm Travis McElroy. I'm Griffin McElroy.

721
01:10:53,680 --> 01:11:18,880
It's been my brother, my brother, me, kids, your dad, Square on the Lips.

722

Maximumfun.org. Comedy and culture. Artist owned. Listener supported.

723
01:11:26,560 --> 01:11:33,200
All right. This one is about some books. One, two, one, two, three, four.

724
01:11:33,200 --> 01:11:36,800
Hi everybody. My name is Justin McElroy. And I'm Sydney McElroy. And together

725
01:11:36,800 --> 01:11:40,480
we're the hosts of Sawbones, a marital tour of misguided medicine.

726
01:11:40,480 --> 01:11:44,080
What does that mean for you, the podcast consumer? Well, it means that you're going

727
01:11:44,080 --> 01:11:48,240
to get a lot of stories about how we used to do weird stuff to people

728
01:11:48,240 --> 01:11:52,080
in order to try to fix them. Do you know that we used to think diseases were

729
01:11:52,080 --> 01:11:55,760
caused by bad smells and that we used to eat mummies for

730
01:11:55,760 --> 01:12:00,480
medicine? That's super funny. I kind of like it.

731
01:12:00,480 --> 01:12:05,120
Well, thanks. And we hope you'll kind of like our show Sawbones, a marital tour of

732
01:12:05,120 --> 01:12:08,720
misguided medicine. It's available every Friday wherever

733
01:12:08,720 --> 01:12:19,040
fine podcasts are sold or at its beautiful picturesque home at Maximumfun.org.

734
01:12:19,040 --> 01:12:41,040
All right.
