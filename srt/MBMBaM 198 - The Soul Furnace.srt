1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:30,800
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:47,760
Hello everybody, and welcome to my brother, my brother, me, and advice show for the modern era.

6
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:51,040
I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy. I'm your middle brother, Travis McElroy.

7
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:56,800
I'm your babiest baby baby, Griffin McElroy. April showers have brought May flowers.

8
00:00:56,800 --> 00:01:03,920
We are recording before May, sir. There's no way that you know about the relative florality.

9
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:09,920
My flowers have already come in. I got some Easter lilies that done popped off.

10
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:12,720
But then they're not May flowers, you fucking liar.

11
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:17,840
Yeah, April showers done brought April flowers again, Twight.

12
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:18,720
I guess.

13
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:21,840
You don't know. There could be a solar flare tomorrow.

14
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:26,800
It kills everything on Earth, like in that movie Next.

15
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:32,080
Please don't say things like that, Griffin. You know how prone I am to panic like that.

16
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:38,560
Please don't put also in my sphere of consciousness the possibility of solar flare activity.

17
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:44,320
April showers bring April flowers and May brings a total global extinction event.

18
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:46,800
Like in the movie Next.

19
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:51,280
Or an extinction level event like on the Busta Rhymes album.

20
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:52,160
Which one?

21
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:52,660
Yes.

22
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:55,760
Extinction level event is the name of that one.

23
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:57,040
I'm not familiar.

24
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:59,360
Man, I hope I got that right.

25
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:07,840
I do not make many rap references and I did not. Yes, correct.

26
00:02:08,480 --> 00:02:09,600
I did nail that one.

27
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:13,840
A no look shot from Justin McElroy, nothing but net.

28
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:14,800
A no Wikipedia shot.

29
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:18,720
A no listen, no knowledge of what the fuck he's talking about shot.

30
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:22,400
I sunk it. I sunk it and I'm gonna live with that forever.

31
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:28,000
Never forget that one time I made that Busta reference and everybody loved it.

32
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:33,040
Is there really nothing we can talk about in the news that's like-

33
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:36,000
I mean, there's Hoskins.

34
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:41,760
Yeah, that'll be a real goof starter. A real barn burner and a goof starter, that one.

35
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:45,040
At least my wife will finally be able to tell him and Danny DeVito apart,

36
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:47,920
so that's like something. If you see one of those guys, it's Danny.

37
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:56,240
Yeah, but unless you're watching an old movie in which I didn't typically see Hoskins on my day

38
00:02:56,240 --> 00:03:01,280
to day, I would witness him in the long go Friday or something like that,

39
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:04,160
not like on the street and be like, are you DeVito?

40
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:07,520
I bet he got that a lot though.

41
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:08,960
Probably not, they look nothing alike.

42
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:10,720
And he's British.

43
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:11,440
And also he's British.

44
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:15,120
I'm ready to help people and I know you guys are too, so let's just get to it.

45
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:19,600
Yeah, now that I'm super sad about Bob Hoskins, let's go ahead and light the ignition.

46
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:24,560
I'm a recently single 27 year old female. I've always had a thing for older guys,

47
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:28,720
but I'm wondering how old is too old and that's from- it's not because of daddy issues.

48
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:33,440
That's good context, I appreciate that in there.

49
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:37,120
My first question is, maybe it is.

50
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:40,800
That's my first question.

51
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:45,920
Kind of a weird shade to throw at this person we've just met, but okay.

52
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:53,360
Listen, I totally get it because older dudes tend to have their shit together.

53
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:57,440
Older humans tend to have their shit together.

54
00:03:57,440 --> 00:04:00,640
Regardless of gender, the older you are, the more shit together you typically have.

55
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:03,760
Yes, but the question asker didn't say, I like to date older humans.

56
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:05,920
That's a good point.

57
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:10,560
But I don't know that that's 100% true because I feel like there's a bell curve where you start

58
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:15,520
to figure shit out in your 30s and then when you turn 45, you fucking lose the script a little bit.

59
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:22,160
I'm pretty sure that what the key to this is just to pick somebody who's sort of your

60
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:28,160
constant in the- like an older male actor that is your constant-

61
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:32,480
Or scientist or political figure. You don't have to limit it to just celebrity.

62
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:39,600
That's fine. Pick the sexiest biologist you can find and let him be your bellwether.

63
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:42,480
By which I mean, let's say you settle on Clooney.

64
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:44,880
That feels right to me as a 27 year old.

65
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:46,400
You settle on Clooney.

66
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:55,280
As Clooney ages, so does your window of fellas you can date.

67
00:04:55,280 --> 00:05:00,160
So it's a constantly shifting window between your age and Clooney's age.

68
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:01,440
Here's a counter question.

69
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:09,440
As you age, how suddenly will there be an age at which they are older but too young to fit

70
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:10,800
within your window?

71
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:17,280
You know, so like right now at 27, maybe 40, you know, it's like I'm attracted to older guys and

72
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:18,800
that age starts at 40.

73
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:24,240
But when you're like 34, 40 won't fit into that window anymore.

74
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:25,120
No, now it's 60.

75
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:26,560
I get some graph paper or something.

76
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:27,060
Yeah.

77
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:33,300
There's got to be a sliding scale where it's like 10 years older, but not older than, you know,

78
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:35,380
25 years older than you.

79
00:05:35,380 --> 00:05:38,900
Something like that, you know, anywhere it always moves with you as you go.

80
00:05:38,900 --> 00:05:40,900
So that when you're like 67.

81
00:05:40,900 --> 00:05:44,580
How is that fundamentally different from my Clooney?

82
00:05:44,580 --> 00:05:47,060
Because you didn't have a starting age.

83
00:05:47,060 --> 00:05:48,100
Or a cutoff, Justin.

84
00:05:48,100 --> 00:05:58,260
Your theory is based on the idea that, for instance, myself and George Clooney are aging

85
00:05:58,260 --> 00:06:00,100
at different rates.

86
00:06:00,100 --> 00:06:07,460
I'm pretty sure that every second that passes in George Clooney life also expends a second

87
00:06:07,460 --> 00:06:09,300
of my time on this earth.

88
00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:10,020
Does that make sense?

89
00:06:10,020 --> 00:06:14,180
That's actually a common misconception, Griffin, because he is on famous time.

90
00:06:14,180 --> 00:06:18,020
He's paid for, have you seen that movie Out of Time with Justin Timberlake?

91
00:06:18,020 --> 00:06:18,820
I have not.

92
00:06:18,820 --> 00:06:23,460
But what I believe happens in it is that when people are rich and famous, they can't afford

93
00:06:23,460 --> 00:06:25,780
to be a little bit more leisurely about their day to day.

94
00:06:26,980 --> 00:06:29,940
Let's all put our cards on the table, okay?

95
00:06:29,940 --> 00:06:36,660
One day of Clooney's life is probably worth one year of our life, right?

96
00:06:36,660 --> 00:06:42,820
Like when Clooney passed, here's my, here's my, here's my, here's my, here's my, here's

97
00:06:42,820 --> 00:06:44,900
my, here's what I'm saying.

98
00:06:45,620 --> 00:06:47,380
On the sad day that George Clooney passed...

99
00:06:47,380 --> 00:06:47,860
Oh great.

100
00:06:47,860 --> 00:06:49,300
Now let's keep all of this, like...

101
00:06:50,420 --> 00:06:51,540
Now, hang on.

102
00:06:51,540 --> 00:06:52,260
Now, hear me out.

103
00:06:53,300 --> 00:06:57,220
On the day that George Clooney passes, if we assume that I'm still alive, I hope I'm

104
00:06:57,220 --> 00:06:57,620
not.

105
00:06:57,620 --> 00:06:58,820
I don't want to see this.

106
00:06:58,820 --> 00:07:04,660
But when George Clooney passes, I would assume that the majority of the human population

107
00:07:04,660 --> 00:07:11,940
would say, I would trade one more day of George Clooney on this earth for one year of this

108
00:07:11,940 --> 00:07:14,440
portly gentleman from West Virginia's life.

109
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:15,280
I would trade away one year.

110
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:16,280
I have enough people do that.

111
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:18,040
We could have Clooney for another month

112
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:20,240
and Justin would be dead.

113
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:21,560
Think about it.

114
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:23,940
I just think Clooney would appreciate it.

115
00:07:23,940 --> 00:07:25,960
And I think that given the possibility,

116
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:27,840
most people would prefer to have Clooney.

117
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:29,160
That's all I'm saying.

118
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:30,320
How many people do you think,

119
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:32,480
how many days do you think we could gain back

120
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:35,920
from people doing like a give a year, get a day program?

121
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:40,160
Is Clooney the best target for this?

122
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:43,160
Are we saying that he is the most valuable human being

123
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:44,000
on earth?

124
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:44,820
You are correct, Griffin,

125
00:07:44,820 --> 00:07:46,680
because we need to do Clooney and Brad Pitt

126
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:49,320
so we can have like oceans 46.

127
00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:52,900
That's going to eat up a thousand human lives.

128
00:07:52,900 --> 00:07:56,640
We are going to throw a thousand human lives into a Clooney.

129
00:07:56,640 --> 00:07:57,720
How many people are you willing to lay down

130
00:07:57,720 --> 00:07:58,920
before the altar of Clooney?

131
00:07:58,920 --> 00:08:01,960
Who are we going to toss into the soul furnace?

132
00:08:03,260 --> 00:08:06,080
It will really hustle up production though.

133
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:08,580
Like if Stevie Soda is like,

134
00:08:08,580 --> 00:08:10,480
can we get one more take on that?

135
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:11,920
And it's like, well, I don't know.

136
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:13,200
I don't know.

137
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:14,360
I don't know, Stevie.

138
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:16,240
Do you know somebody who's going to trade away

139
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:18,320
a year of their life for this extra shot?

140
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:19,160
Cause it's not, I say we got it.

141
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:21,320
Oh, it's like Kickstarter, but with like,

142
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:22,400
with your life force.

143
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:25,500
It's Patreon, but with a soul furnace

144
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:28,560
that you have to burn your whole family into.

145
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:30,920
To be fair, Patreon already does kind of sound

146
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:31,880
like a soul furnace.

147
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:33,120
That's true.

148
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:35,320
It's a very great- Let your children be gnashed

149
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:38,560
in the teeth of Patreon, the soul furnace.

150
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:43,560
Step your ears into his gape.

151
00:08:43,920 --> 00:08:45,360
Gross.

152
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:46,440
Gross.

153
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:47,280
So-

154
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:49,160
Gaping ma of Patreon, the soul furnace.

155
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:51,360
To answer your question,

156
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:53,640
burn yourself in the soul furnace.

157
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:55,560
And maybe we can, maybe we can get a new

158
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:56,480
ocean movie going.

159
00:08:57,960 --> 00:08:58,780
Graffiti got a Yahoo?

160
00:08:58,780 --> 00:08:59,620
Yeah, sure.

161
00:09:01,060 --> 00:09:03,180
This Yahoo was sent in by Alan Black.

162
00:09:03,180 --> 00:09:04,020
Thank you, Alan Black.

163
00:09:04,020 --> 00:09:08,720
It's by Yahoo Answers user, Beth, who asks,

164
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:12,780
can I become a police officer, but I'm tiny.

165
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:15,000
So that's nice.

166
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,240
You heard that first part and you were like,

167
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:17,940
well, yes, obviously.

168
00:09:17,940 --> 00:09:18,780
And then she was like,

169
00:09:18,780 --> 00:09:21,560
she's arguing with you in the title of the question.

170
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:23,720
Although I have the option of striving

171
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:24,880
for something more academic,

172
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:26,960
it's always been my passion to help people.

173
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:28,240
I want to be on the front lines.

174
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:30,120
My problem is that I'm very small.

175
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:32,640
At only five foot four and a hundred pounds,

176
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:34,920
won't it be difficult for me to do my job?

177
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:37,540
I work with horses and sometimes face difficulties

178
00:09:37,540 --> 00:09:40,860
due to my size, but do have techniques and tools

179
00:09:40,860 --> 00:09:44,460
to aid me in most situations to achieve the same outcome

180
00:09:44,460 --> 00:09:47,480
that a larger, taller, stronger person would get.

181
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:50,440
Would working as an officer require similar techniques

182
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:53,320
or tools, or would I really be struggling

183
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:54,520
with this shortcoming?

184
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:56,420
No pun intended, I'm assuming.

185
00:09:56,420 --> 00:09:58,560
If it helps, I live in Western Canada.

186
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:01,920
And then of course there's like nine comments

187
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:02,960
of Yahoo Answers users.

188
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:06,200
People like, yeah, just shoot them with your gun.

189
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:08,400
And then she updates.

190
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:09,800
I don't have guns in Canada.

191
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:11,160
She updates to say,

192
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:13,640
I don't believe drawing your gun to intimidate people

193
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:16,920
is something law enforcement encourages on a daily basis.

194
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:20,520
Well, but I feel like she's answered her own question.

195
00:10:21,380 --> 00:10:22,600
She likes to ride horses.

196
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:23,680
She's going to be a Mountie.

197
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:26,800
You're on the, like a huge intimidating animal.

198
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:28,800
Yeah, you're absolutely right Travis.

199
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:29,720
When you're on a horse,

200
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:34,720
that horse's height gets naturally added to your height.

201
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:36,740
A person on a, what I'm saying to you

202
00:10:36,740 --> 00:10:39,400
is the person on a horse is the tallest thing in the world

203
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:43,900
because they are elevated not just by hooves and stems,

204
00:10:43,900 --> 00:10:47,880
but they're elevated by spirit and a bond

205
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:49,280
that most of us could never understand.

206
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:51,360
That's six inches right there.

207
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:52,480
Six inches of bond.

208
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:53,920
Right there. Easy.

209
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:56,180
Can you imagine Yao Ming on a horse?

210
00:10:57,300 --> 00:10:59,520
Yeah, that's how Galactus got his start.

211
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:00,440
Did you know that?

212
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:01,380
Where's Earth?

213
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:04,360
It's in Yao Ming's mouth.

214
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:06,000
But he was on the Earth, I know.

215
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:08,560
Now where is he?

216
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:09,380
Now where is he?

217
00:11:09,380 --> 00:11:10,220
We don't know.

218
00:11:10,220 --> 00:11:11,060
He's all around you.

219
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:13,540
Keep looking up.

220
00:11:13,540 --> 00:11:18,120
I have never had an encounter with a police officer

221
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:21,720
that I would consider great.

222
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:27,760
And in no circumstance did I feel

223
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:32,120
like I had a better shot at coming out of the encounter

224
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:37,120
with more of my dignity in hand

225
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:39,720
based on the size of the person

226
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:42,880
who was fucking writing me a ticket

227
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:45,280
for just living my goddamn life.

228
00:11:46,620 --> 00:11:49,240
Like if a person, in the many, many times

229
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:50,920
that I have been penalized

230
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:53,720
just for living my goddamn day to day,

231
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:58,640
I've never looked at the officer who was penalizing me

232
00:11:58,640 --> 00:12:01,120
and gone, well, I'm a couple inches taller than you,

233
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:01,940
so.

234
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:06,560
Yeah, I would say I very rarely size up

235
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:08,560
a police officer I'm interacting with.

236
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:10,600
I don't think, could I take this person?

237
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:12,840
I tend to just sort of hand over my wallet

238
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:13,680
and ask for leave.

239
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:16,000
Hey, just take as much as you want out of there, man.

240
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:16,960
You got me.

241
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:17,920
You got me.

242
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:22,500
Oh, I was drinking a Diet Mountain Dew at a bus stop.

243
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:23,520
Didn't know that was.

244
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:24,360
Yeah, go ahead.

245
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:26,200
Just, what do you think, like 150?

246
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:28,000
200 for sure.

247
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,000
Oh, 200, sure.

248
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,040
I mean, I don't have 200 in the wallet.

249
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:32,400
I can hit the ATM if you,

250
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:34,960
oh, you're just gonna come with me to the ATM.

251
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:35,800
Okay.

252
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:36,880
Oh, I'm being robbed at the ATM.

253
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:37,700
Can you stop?

254
00:12:37,700 --> 00:12:38,960
Oh, you didn't stop him.

255
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:40,320
Still want that 200 though.

256
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:42,540
That's okay.

257
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:48,440
Somebody has got to be around to catch the short criminals.

258
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:52,120
If you're too tall, maybe you're at a disadvantage there.

259
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:57,080
Maybe that's when you get the smaller officer on the scene.

260
00:12:57,080 --> 00:12:59,840
I would almost argue that the problem is

261
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:01,800
that this person is not small enough

262
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:04,340
because I think you got a crust backwards

263
00:13:04,340 --> 00:13:06,120
to be the tiny detective.

264
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:07,360
And if you're the tiny detective,

265
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:12,360
like we got someone under five-fives been murdered,

266
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:15,240
call the tiny detective.

267
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:16,760
We've tracked the serial killer,

268
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:19,560
but he's hiding under a porch.

269
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:21,000
Get the tiny detective.

270
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,120
Get the tiny detective.

271
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:23,960
You will be-

272
00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:26,280
I can't been far enough to see these footprints.

273
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:27,120
Yeah.

274
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:27,960
Damn, my height.

275
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:29,880
Someone with lower eyes.

276
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:34,120
I think you're gonna be in real danger

277
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:37,160
of encroaching on the rescue rangers here though.

278
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:39,080
Yeah, that seems like their beat.

279
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:41,460
I would argue that a crime has officially gone

280
00:13:41,460 --> 00:13:42,560
slipping through the cracks

281
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:44,460
if it's somewhere that the tiny detective

282
00:13:44,460 --> 00:13:46,360
is needed to access.

283
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:47,200
Yeah.

284
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:50,020
That's something, where's that TLC show, you know?

285
00:13:50,020 --> 00:13:51,880
They make a show about the littlest chocolatiers,

286
00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:56,800
which is, I'm sorry, fucking stereotyping and racism,

287
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:59,400
but they won't make a show about a little person

288
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:02,440
that's defying societal conventions

289
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:04,400
and busting some fucking perps.

290
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:07,060
Sure, it's also, where's the proof, you know?

291
00:14:07,060 --> 00:14:08,960
That's what I've always wondered.

292
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:10,080
What do you mean?

293
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:12,000
I'm saying this show is saying,

294
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,020
hey, check this out.

295
00:14:13,020 --> 00:14:15,020
We got the littlest chocolatiers here.

296
00:14:15,020 --> 00:14:16,000
Fucking prove it.

297
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:17,760
Yeah.

298
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:18,580
That's a fine point.

299
00:14:18,580 --> 00:14:19,420
Fucking prove to me

300
00:14:19,420 --> 00:14:22,160
that there aren't littler chocolatiers somewhere.

301
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:23,480
I don't think you can.

302
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:25,520
There's a lot of people on this earth.

303
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:27,400
The littlest chocolatiers is about them

304
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:30,040
going around the globe and whacking smaller chocolatiers.

305
00:14:30,040 --> 00:14:31,400
Yeah.

306
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:32,560
One day, their strive,

307
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:35,200
the littlest chocolatiers is not a title

308
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:36,960
as much as a goal.

309
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:38,600
Yeah, when it started out,

310
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:40,900
it was we're the 19th littlest chocolatiers,

311
00:14:40,900 --> 00:14:42,120
and now they're down to like the fourth.

312
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:44,120
The other three are in hiding.

313
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:45,000
Not good.

314
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,540
This also would be a very upsetting premise

315
00:14:47,540 --> 00:14:48,920
for 19 kids and counting.

316
00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:50,720
Sure, sure would.

317
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:51,720
Boy.

318
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:54,200
Counting, but in which direction?

319
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:55,040
Oh, no.

320
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:56,840
You're right.

321
00:14:56,840 --> 00:14:58,800
This week on the series finale

322
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:00,440
of One Kid and Counting,

323
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,720
a race through the woods,

324
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:05,140
a desperate hunt.

325
00:15:06,040 --> 00:15:08,160
Only one will emerge victorious.

326
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:09,020
And by this point,

327
00:15:09,020 --> 00:15:11,720
the kid is basically Katniss from The Hunger Games.

328
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:14,080
The kid is hiding in tree tops,

329
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:17,360
taking out deer with a bow for sustenance.

330
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:18,360
Ah, fuck, we ran out of kids.

331
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:19,200
K plus eight.

332
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:22,280
Can we get like three of them?

333
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:24,240
Please, Sweeps is coming up.

334
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:26,540
My wife is expecting our firstborn in July,

335
00:15:26,540 --> 00:15:29,060
and I'm trying to keep my cursing to a minimum.

336
00:15:29,060 --> 00:15:33,240
I recently used cowabunga in place of an expletive,

337
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:35,180
and let's just say I suffered some serious mockery

338
00:15:35,180 --> 00:15:37,120
from my wife for using that word,

339
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:38,040
and you earned it.

340
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:40,500
Can we please suggest some place words

341
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:43,000
I could use instead of typical expletives?

342
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,080
That's from Cussin in Canada.

343
00:15:45,080 --> 00:15:46,360
How about these?

344
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:49,000
Fuck, shit, ass, dick.

345
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,640
Like, if your kid hears you say this shit

346
00:15:51,640 --> 00:15:52,520
and goes to school,

347
00:15:52,520 --> 00:15:54,560
and it's like, stubs his toe in second grade,

348
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:56,040
and is like, oh, cowabunga,

349
00:15:56,040 --> 00:15:57,780
he is gonna be killed.

350
00:15:57,780 --> 00:16:02,780
He's gonna learn a lot of curse words very fast.

351
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:05,360
Let me bounce this off you two.

352
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:08,240
In second grade, I swore like a fucking sailor,

353
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:09,960
and so did everybody I know,

354
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:14,160
and maybe that explains like why I am the way I am today,

355
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:16,560
but like it was a nonstop,

356
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:21,560
just like jet stream of filth coming out of my mouth.

357
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:25,080
Listen, here's some advice.

358
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:27,640
We teach kids about words and language all the time,

359
00:16:27,640 --> 00:16:29,800
where we say like, oh no, that's not a dog, it's a cat,

360
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:31,160
and this is what a cat is,

361
00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:33,280
and kids have this,

362
00:16:33,280 --> 00:16:35,200
there's this psychologist named Piaget

363
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:37,680
who had this box theory that as kids develop,

364
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:40,760
they form boxes into which ideas are put,

365
00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:43,160
and so when you like show a kid a dog and say,

366
00:16:43,160 --> 00:16:46,380
that's a dog, it was okay, four legs, fur, dog, right?

367
00:16:46,380 --> 00:16:47,720
And then you have to break down that like,

368
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:49,440
no, sometimes it's a cat, so whatever.

369
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:52,440
You stupid fucking kid, that's obviously a dog.

370
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:54,960
So why don't we teach our kids the same thing with language

371
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:57,100
like, hey, fuck is an awesome word,

372
00:16:57,100 --> 00:16:59,400
but it's used to apply in this situation

373
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:01,120
and not this situation.

374
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:04,960
Use it here, don't use it here, don't be an asshole.

375
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:07,640
I think you just tell them like if you use it at a teacher,

376
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:09,080
you get in trouble,

377
00:17:09,080 --> 00:17:10,120
but when you're on the playground,

378
00:17:10,120 --> 00:17:11,560
if you say cowabunga,

379
00:17:11,560 --> 00:17:14,280
you're gonna get jumped out of the playground.

380
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:17,480
So yeah, so teach your kids like what words to say when

381
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:18,760
and when not to say them,

382
00:17:18,760 --> 00:17:21,300
and let your kid just be like a goddamn human being

383
00:17:21,300 --> 00:17:22,560
living in the world,

384
00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:23,800
and don't try to shelter your kid

385
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:26,160
because otherwise they're gonna learn the words

386
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:28,040
because look, they're going to,

387
00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:29,240
it's in TV, it's in movies,

388
00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:30,560
every other kid on the playground.

389
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:32,240
They're gonna watch Game of Thrones.

390
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:34,720
They're gonna know what fisting is before they're six.

391
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:35,560
Yeah.

392
00:17:35,560 --> 00:17:38,040
So if you don't teach your kid some kind of context

393
00:17:38,040 --> 00:17:39,760
to put these words into,

394
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:41,640
then you're just handing them a loaded gun

395
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:42,480
and letting them go.

396
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:43,300
You know what I mean?

397
00:17:43,300 --> 00:17:45,720
Teach the words to the kids.

398
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:46,840
Tell them what they mean,

399
00:17:46,840 --> 00:17:48,840
and when to use them and when not to use them,

400
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:51,480
and treat kids like tiny adults.

401
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:52,600
That's what I do.

402
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:54,240
I've been thinking about this a lot lately

403
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:55,080
with a kid on the way,

404
00:17:55,080 --> 00:17:58,800
and I mean, I don't think anything's wrong with profanity.

405
00:17:58,800 --> 00:18:00,040
Profanity doesn't offend me.

406
00:18:00,040 --> 00:18:01,980
I think we spend too much time worrying about it,

407
00:18:01,980 --> 00:18:04,280
but I do know that in certain contexts,

408
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:06,360
it's not appreciated, right?

409
00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:09,220
Like I direct children's theater sometimes,

410
00:18:09,220 --> 00:18:10,760
and I have a hard time.

411
00:18:10,760 --> 00:18:13,760
I don't censor myself basically at any other part of my life,

412
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:15,880
so I have a hard time sort of shutting that off.

413
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:19,400
If I can't make that distinction ably,

414
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:21,880
why would I expect a five-year-old to be able to do that?

415
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:23,880
Oh, because your kid's gonna be way better than you.

416
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:24,720
Yeah.

417
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:26,600
Well, that's the hope.

418
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:28,640
I mean, I guess that's sort of the dream and fear

419
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:29,480
of every new parent.

420
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:31,140
Well, because it'll be half Sidney,

421
00:18:31,140 --> 00:18:34,920
so I have to assume it'll be 50% better.

422
00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:37,360
Sidney curses as much as I do, though.

423
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:40,240
She's not limiting herself.

424
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:44,480
I just think you should swear,

425
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:47,160
because is there anything better

426
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:49,920
than when a little kid swears?

427
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:54,920
We used to try to get Riley, Justin's little sister-in-law,

428
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:58,040
to swear when she was a little tyke,

429
00:18:58,040 --> 00:19:00,000
because it was the fucking funniest thing ever,

430
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,960
and it got to a point where we taught her all of them,

431
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:04,520
and then we would make her say some more

432
00:19:04,520 --> 00:19:06,360
off-the-beaten-path stuff.

433
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:10,360
Just some, let's just say, deep cuts

434
00:19:10,360 --> 00:19:13,260
based on troubling ideas that aren't,

435
00:19:13,260 --> 00:19:18,260
maybe didn't fall into the Carlinian sort of structure

436
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:20,600
of what swear words traditionally are,

437
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:22,760
but they were, if heard by an adult

438
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:25,040
that was in charge of her well-being,

439
00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:27,480
would be frustrating, I think.

440
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:29,200
I did enjoy that kill Whitey kick.

441
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:32,080
That was a good kick that we got her on for like a bit,

442
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:33,120
for like a minute,

443
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:35,800
because she doesn't know what the fuck she's saying.

444
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:39,360
You only have a few years where you can pull that game off,

445
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:41,540
and it's the best game.

446
00:19:41,540 --> 00:19:43,960
Are you able to, I don't know the law and the rules,

447
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:46,040
are you able to make your kid bulletproof

448
00:19:46,040 --> 00:19:48,200
to getting in trouble for cursing

449
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:50,640
if you yourself do not believe it is a problem?

450
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:52,360
I mean, that's the big hammer, right?

451
00:19:52,360 --> 00:19:53,640
It's like, we'll bring your parents in.

452
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:55,660
If I just stare that prince in the eye and say,

453
00:19:55,660 --> 00:19:56,500
I don't care. Yeah, I mean,

454
00:19:56,500 --> 00:19:57,320
that's always the worry.

455
00:19:57,320 --> 00:19:58,160
I'm gonna call your dad, and you're like,

456
00:19:58,160 --> 00:19:59,220
yeah, no, I taught him that.

457
00:19:59,220 --> 00:20:02,360
Call him, get my pops on the fucking phone.

458
00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:03,920
Let's see how this shakes out for you.

459
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:05,200
Who the fuck is this?

460
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:07,880
You trying to say to my fucking kid,

461
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:09,780
how about you let me take care of my own shit at home,

462
00:20:09,780 --> 00:20:11,120
and you keep to yourself, teach?

463
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:12,760
How about you do job number one,

464
00:20:12,760 --> 00:20:14,400
and don't let my kid die, teach,

465
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:16,880
and then I'll handle the edumacation when they get home.

466
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:18,340
How does that squeal you?

467
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:23,480
Are you, so where did you land vis-a-vis cursing?

468
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:24,660
I don't have an answer.

469
00:20:24,660 --> 00:20:26,320
I mean, I guess I'll try to limit it

470
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:28,800
until they're old enough to know when not to.

471
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:30,640
I guess would be the question.

472
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:33,640
There's a lot of things I won't expose them to

473
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:36,480
when they're too young to sort of handle it, right?

474
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:40,680
Like Cosmos, I don't need my kid thinking about

475
00:20:40,680 --> 00:20:44,080
how infinitesimal they are in the grand scheme of things

476
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:45,160
when they're five.

477
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:47,600
Nobody needs anything that heavy in their life.

478
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:49,680
And don't let her start drinking until she's like 12

479
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:51,260
and can really handle it.

480
00:20:51,260 --> 00:20:52,100
Yeah.

481
00:20:52,100 --> 00:20:52,920
Oh, crap.

482
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:58,400
So are there any words that this person can use?

483
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:00,080
I was sitting here trying to think of something

484
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:02,060
that wouldn't get you mocked,

485
00:21:02,060 --> 00:21:04,700
but could still help you express your frustration

486
00:21:04,700 --> 00:21:05,540
at something.

487
00:21:05,540 --> 00:21:06,760
And all I can think of is like old-timey,

488
00:21:06,760 --> 00:21:10,280
like 1930s, 1940s phrases.

489
00:21:10,280 --> 00:21:12,760
I like ding-dang.

490
00:21:12,760 --> 00:21:15,240
Just like shut the ding-dang door.

491
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:16,600
What about guldarnet?

492
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:19,000
No, that's too prospectory.

493
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,120
Yeah, a little prospectory.

494
00:21:20,120 --> 00:21:21,940
What about, I like shucks.

495
00:21:21,940 --> 00:21:24,840
It's simple, but effective.

496
00:21:24,840 --> 00:21:26,320
Crumbs is good.

497
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:28,960
Yeah, crumbs is good if you're an effete

498
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:32,120
British socialite in the Victorian era.

499
00:21:32,120 --> 00:21:34,120
Oh, crumbs.

500
00:21:34,120 --> 00:21:34,960
I don't know.

501
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:39,960
I get into like sort of grooves with profanity,

502
00:21:39,980 --> 00:21:41,960
or non-profanity, I guess.

503
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:43,400
Been saying hotcha-matcha a lot

504
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:45,120
because I've been watching The Critic on DVD.

505
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:45,960
Yeah.

506
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:47,240
You can use that if you want.

507
00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:48,980
I catch myself saying fudge a lot,

508
00:21:48,980 --> 00:21:52,800
like not ironically, but just like fudge, and it feels good.

509
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:57,380
I do a lot of how you doing.

510
00:21:57,380 --> 00:22:02,220
Like from Friends, the television show.

511
00:22:03,320 --> 00:22:05,920
Then when Ross would say it all the time.

512
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:07,780
I think I'll ban hate speech.

513
00:22:07,780 --> 00:22:09,780
I don't think hate, like slurs,

514
00:22:09,780 --> 00:22:11,920
I will probably take a hard line against.

515
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:12,760
Yeah.

516
00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:14,420
But see, that's, okay, this is what I love

517
00:22:14,420 --> 00:22:17,400
is because that is for like a really good reason.

518
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:19,500
That is rude on all levels.

519
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:21,200
It's bad taste, it's bad.

520
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:23,080
I think expletives are just bad

521
00:22:23,080 --> 00:22:25,200
because someone said they were.

522
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:26,800
Yeah, right?

523
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:28,360
I've seen a lot of parents trying to make

524
00:22:28,360 --> 00:22:29,700
shut up an expletive.

525
00:22:29,700 --> 00:22:31,240
Come on, stupid.

526
00:22:31,240 --> 00:22:32,280
Or that one too.

527
00:22:32,280 --> 00:22:33,120
Suck.

528
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:34,880
Stop it, stop it.

529
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:37,280
I remember when I turned 16

530
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:39,240
and I could use damn around the house

531
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:40,360
as much as I wanted to.

532
00:22:40,360 --> 00:22:41,760
Wasn't even a big deal anymore.

533
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:44,460
You got to, on your 16th name day,

534
00:22:44,460 --> 00:22:47,080
you were allowed to fucking pick one word

535
00:22:47,080 --> 00:22:48,320
that you were allowed to pick.

536
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:50,880
And if that was the case, why did you go with damn?

537
00:22:51,880 --> 00:22:52,800
Damn is the one I use.

538
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:54,440
I don't think I've said damn.

539
00:22:54,440 --> 00:22:57,640
I'll say god damn because if you're gonna go to town,

540
00:22:57,640 --> 00:22:58,880
you might as well go into Lincoln.

541
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:00,120
But I don't think I've said like,

542
00:23:00,120 --> 00:23:01,980
stub my toe, damn.

543
00:23:01,980 --> 00:23:05,240
I don't think I've said that in my life.

544
00:23:05,240 --> 00:23:06,580
I say damn you a lot.

545
00:23:08,300 --> 00:23:09,260
When?

546
00:23:09,260 --> 00:23:12,000
Like when I am usually doing carpentry

547
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,040
or more often than not, fuck you.

548
00:23:14,040 --> 00:23:14,880
But damn you is the best.

549
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:15,720
When you're larping?

550
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:17,960
When I'm doing carpentry.

551
00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:20,120
I've been playing Dark Souls too

552
00:23:20,120 --> 00:23:21,800
so I've been really reinvesting.

553
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:26,800
It's the equivalent of going to a rededication ceremony

554
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:29,980
in your marriage except with profanity.

555
00:23:29,980 --> 00:23:33,300
I'm rediscovering profanity, reawakening our relationship,

556
00:23:33,300 --> 00:23:35,160
bonding again.

557
00:23:36,160 --> 00:23:38,720
I just can't think of a situation where I'd wanna say damn

558
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:42,000
or I wouldn't say like, shit if it's my fault

559
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,520
or fuck if it's the thing.

560
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:47,120
If I think it's the thing that I'm mad at,

561
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:49,380
that it screwed up, then I'll yell fuck at it.

562
00:23:49,380 --> 00:23:51,240
But I don't, damn.

563
00:23:51,240 --> 00:23:53,800
That's the only way I can say it.

564
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:55,000
Damn.

565
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,560
I can't, it sounds weird like damn.

566
00:23:57,560 --> 00:24:01,040
Griffin goes full lift gal whenever he tries to say damn.

567
00:24:01,040 --> 00:24:01,960
It's a mystery.

568
00:24:03,720 --> 00:24:04,560
Oh boy.

569
00:24:04,560 --> 00:24:05,940
You wanna Yahoo? Please.

570
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:08,720
This'll be an interesting one.

571
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:13,520
It was actually sent in by Justin Minsker, my dear friend.

572
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:15,720
Based on a conversation we were having the other night

573
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:21,220
and then it spawned into a hunt for Yahoos.

574
00:24:21,220 --> 00:24:24,320
It's by Yahoo Answers user Jack X who asks,

575
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:29,320
large silverback gorilla versus large male lion.

576
00:24:31,040 --> 00:24:33,520
The gorilla is said to be as strong as 10 to 12

577
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:36,160
world strongmen or higher.

578
00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:37,000
What?

579
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:39,720
It have massive scary arms.

580
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:43,960
World strongmen, it have massive scary arms

581
00:24:43,960 --> 00:24:48,320
that can rip limbs with a bite of 1,000 plus,

582
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:51,920
the useful hands and thumbs for grabbing.

583
00:24:51,920 --> 00:24:53,860
The gorilla's around 500 pounds,

584
00:24:53,860 --> 00:24:56,540
but obese gorilla have been around 600 pounds

585
00:24:56,540 --> 00:25:00,080
with deadly canines as the lion versus.

586
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:02,520
The lion's is a natural predator.

587
00:25:02,520 --> 00:25:05,800
Their strategy is aim for throat, lock and kill.

588
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:08,280
The claws can leave terrible scars.

589
00:25:09,320 --> 00:25:12,680
Which I'm sure the gorilla's very concerned about.

590
00:25:12,680 --> 00:25:14,480
Oh, damn, I got scarred.

591
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:16,680
My modeling career is over.

592
00:25:16,680 --> 00:25:20,560
Damn, with deadly canines,

593
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:23,760
large males can weigh up to 550 pounds.

594
00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:29,400
So that was it and we did debate this for,

595
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:33,880
I mean, it was one of those arguments like cake or pie.

596
00:25:33,880 --> 00:25:37,940
That's just like, once you get that going, that's the night.

597
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:41,120
That's like your whole night at that point.

598
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:43,960
There was another one, a very popular perennial favorite

599
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:46,520
among my group of friends about

600
00:25:48,360 --> 00:25:50,520
if you were sitting in a group of your friends

601
00:25:50,520 --> 00:25:52,000
and you had to poop right there,

602
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:53,480
right there in that instant,

603
00:25:53,480 --> 00:25:56,120
would you rather do it in a diaper that you're wearing

604
00:25:56,120 --> 00:25:58,960
and have to be in that or do it in a bucket

605
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:01,320
and then you're clean, but you just did that.

606
00:26:03,720 --> 00:26:04,640
Little bit off topic,

607
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:06,640
I'm introducing a lot of complicated,

608
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:09,200
very challenging. So if a lion has to poop in a bucket

609
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:11,560
and a gorilla's wearing a diaper.

610
00:26:11,560 --> 00:26:12,760
You're mixing it up.

611
00:26:12,760 --> 00:26:14,920
The gorilla's in the bucket.

612
00:26:14,920 --> 00:26:16,560
We'll focus on gorilla versus lion,

613
00:26:16,560 --> 00:26:19,820
but you guys sort of percolate on that other subject

614
00:26:19,820 --> 00:26:21,560
and we can talk about it off the air.

615
00:26:21,560 --> 00:26:23,440
Before we get started discussing this,

616
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:25,800
I have to take slight umbrage.

617
00:26:25,800 --> 00:26:29,920
I don't know that all of this question askers facts

618
00:26:29,920 --> 00:26:31,680
are correct.

619
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:32,680
What's your ish?

620
00:26:32,680 --> 00:26:35,760
I have seen these strongman competitions

621
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:38,860
and these duders can lift, let's just say low estimate,

622
00:26:38,860 --> 00:26:40,240
cause I can't think of a real number

623
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:41,080
like I've seen them lift,

624
00:26:41,080 --> 00:26:43,720
but like 250 pounds.

625
00:26:43,720 --> 00:26:44,960
So if the gorilla-

626
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:46,400
That's not much at all.

627
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:48,040
That's not very much.

628
00:26:48,040 --> 00:26:49,840
I can easily squat 250.

629
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:54,200
It's basically 800 pounds is the peak,

630
00:26:54,200 --> 00:26:55,440
is sort of the peak of human.

631
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:56,720
Okay, great.

632
00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:58,080
The record is a thousand.

633
00:26:58,080 --> 00:26:58,920
I was looking this up

634
00:26:58,920 --> 00:27:03,400
because I was researching superhero power levels,

635
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:07,080
strength ranges and what have you.

636
00:27:07,080 --> 00:27:08,720
You were building your hero clicks team.

637
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:10,840
Cause they're classified.

638
00:27:10,840 --> 00:27:11,760
Sure.

639
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:13,000
But anyway.

640
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:15,960
But so if the strongman can lift 800 pounds

641
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:19,500
and the gorilla can lift 10 to 12 times that.

642
00:27:21,080 --> 00:27:23,600
Travis, how many times have you read in the news

643
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:27,560
like a chimpanzee just ripped a fucking woman's face off

644
00:27:27,560 --> 00:27:29,280
like it was picking a rag up off the ground.

645
00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:31,800
But the face isn't heavy Griffin.

646
00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:36,800
That's saying that this gorilla could pick up four tons.

647
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:40,960
What about the scene where in Dunstan checks in

648
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:45,520
where Dunstan just fucking cold clocks Jason Alexander

649
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:49,560
and then drags him effortlessly up to the roof of the hotel

650
00:27:49,560 --> 00:27:54,000
and then throws him super far off the hotel to his death.

651
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:55,040
And that's a chimpanzee.

652
00:27:55,040 --> 00:27:55,880
Dunstan wasn't even a goddamn gorilla.

653
00:27:55,880 --> 00:27:58,320
He was an orangutan you stupid bitch.

654
00:27:58,320 --> 00:28:01,160
He was a orangutan chimpanzee gorilla.

655
00:28:01,160 --> 00:28:04,540
It's all different sizes of the same goddamn animal.

656
00:28:04,540 --> 00:28:05,880
I'm saying gorillas are way bigger

657
00:28:05,880 --> 00:28:08,680
than orangutans or chimpanzees or spider monkeys

658
00:28:08,680 --> 00:28:11,920
which are also in their own way very, very strong,

659
00:28:11,920 --> 00:28:14,760
very adept at lifting and crushing and throwing.

660
00:28:14,760 --> 00:28:17,520
So a gorilla is lifting, throwing and crushing power.

661
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:19,440
It's gonna be off the charts.

662
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:21,840
Let me posit a different question.

663
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:24,600
Which animal would win in a battle of wits?

664
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:30,040
The one that can fucking learn and speak flawless English.

665
00:28:30,040 --> 00:28:33,600
And have a pet kitten, I think, basically.

666
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:36,160
But then the lion could just take the kitten hostage

667
00:28:36,160 --> 00:28:38,040
and hold that against the gorilla.

668
00:28:38,040 --> 00:28:40,220
Amy, Amy, smart.

669
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:44,380
Green drop, drink.

670
00:28:44,380 --> 00:28:46,260
I'm went gorilla all the way.

671
00:28:46,260 --> 00:28:48,040
Maybe this doesn't even need to be discussed

672
00:28:48,040 --> 00:28:50,700
because it seems like the logical answer

673
00:28:50,700 --> 00:28:52,440
like a lion can jump up there and scratch

674
00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:54,920
and leave terrible scars and it can bite.

675
00:28:54,920 --> 00:28:56,200
It'll go for the throat.

676
00:28:56,200 --> 00:28:58,040
Gorilla has fucking hands.

677
00:28:58,040 --> 00:28:59,880
It has human hands.

678
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:02,240
It can just grab the lion and just tear it in half.

679
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:06,760
The problem is that I see is like lions are a pack hunter.

680
00:29:07,920 --> 00:29:08,760
You know what I mean?

681
00:29:08,760 --> 00:29:09,580
They run things.

682
00:29:09,580 --> 00:29:12,160
So you wanna give fucking team lion five other lions.

683
00:29:12,160 --> 00:29:14,760
I'm just saying like if it's multiple lions,

684
00:29:14,760 --> 00:29:15,760
you give it to the lion.

685
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:18,160
But that's why lions are able to take down

686
00:29:18,160 --> 00:29:21,280
like gigantic animals because they don't do it

687
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:22,400
by themselves.

688
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:23,960
How about we get the money's in?

689
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:26,400
We didn't really answer the question.

690
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:29,560
Well, it's pretty obvious to me that I think it's a gorilla

691
00:29:29,560 --> 00:29:33,520
because they're smarter and they can sign for help.

692
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:36,360
From other.

693
00:29:36,360 --> 00:29:39,060
I'm gonna go lion just because I like an underdog.

694
00:29:39,060 --> 00:29:40,720
They climb up a tree.

695
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:43,120
They use their jungle wifi.

696
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:45,160
They get on Amazon.

697
00:29:45,160 --> 00:29:47,040
They buy goddamn lion poison.

698
00:29:47,040 --> 00:29:48,720
They're not Gilligan.

699
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:51,040
They're not inventing shit.

700
00:29:51,040 --> 00:29:52,620
They're just like smarter.

701
00:29:52,620 --> 00:29:54,160
And I think they could come up with this strategy.

702
00:29:54,160 --> 00:29:58,000
I feel like the lion would maybe go

703
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:59,800
to where the fight was gonna be

704
00:29:59,800 --> 00:30:01,160
and step in the wrong place.

705
00:30:01,160 --> 00:30:02,940
And there would be like a primitive trap,

706
00:30:02,940 --> 00:30:04,160
like a net.

707
00:30:04,160 --> 00:30:05,000
Definitely.

708
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:07,760
And then the gorillas would just throw small rocks at it.

709
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:09,640
And the gorilla would come out and take off its monocle

710
00:30:09,640 --> 00:30:12,640
and say, you've fallen into my trap, dear lion.

711
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:14,440
Yeah, you've fought gorilla growled.

712
00:30:14,440 --> 00:30:16,400
What a terrible decision.

713
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:21,400
And then it would drink a large gulp of its homemade wine

714
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:24,840
from the hollowed out skull of Jason Alexander.

715
00:30:24,840 --> 00:30:28,560
Here's an unpopular opinion.

716
00:30:28,560 --> 00:30:30,320
I think the soundtrack to Tarzan is better

717
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:31,720
than the soundtrack to Lion King.

718
00:30:31,720 --> 00:30:32,560
Case closed.

719
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:42,120
Why is that even germane?

720
00:30:42,120 --> 00:30:45,360
You gotta think about brand recognition in this battle too.

721
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:47,760
Can we please now go to the money zone?

722
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:58,600
Absolutely.

723
00:30:58,600 --> 00:31:00,180
Listeners, we love you.

724
00:31:00,180 --> 00:31:03,720
We have to tell you, you are so just,

725
00:31:03,720 --> 00:31:05,760
you're such an ingrateful old twerp.

726
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:07,300
You know that?

727
00:31:07,300 --> 00:31:08,140
You know that?

728
00:31:08,140 --> 00:31:11,800
When was the last time you did something nice for moms?

729
00:31:11,800 --> 00:31:13,240
For any, well, for anyone.

730
00:31:13,240 --> 00:31:15,040
Yeah, Travis, for starters.

731
00:31:15,040 --> 00:31:17,920
But how about the person that pushed you

732
00:31:17,920 --> 00:31:22,400
either through their vagina or their tummy

733
00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:24,360
or they adopted you,

734
00:31:24,360 --> 00:31:26,840
which is still a significant amount of work,

735
00:31:26,840 --> 00:31:29,240
I bet, a lot of paperwork and logistics.

736
00:31:30,120 --> 00:31:32,620
You gotta do something nice for them this Mother's Day.

737
00:31:32,620 --> 00:31:34,840
So how about you make it rain

738
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:39,440
a hundred beautiful blooms in a bouquet

739
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:42,620
and a free glass vase from proflowers.com

740
00:31:42,620 --> 00:31:44,640
for just $19.99.

741
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:46,080
A hundred blooms?

742
00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:50,640
A hundred blooms, make it rain from the sky blooms

743
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:51,480
on your suite.

744
00:31:51,480 --> 00:31:52,620
I don't think she'll be able to process

745
00:31:52,620 --> 00:31:54,360
how many blooms that is.

746
00:31:54,360 --> 00:31:55,200
No, she'll start to count.

747
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:56,200
So you make her sit down

748
00:31:56,200 --> 00:31:58,000
and count every single one of them.

749
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,260
You count every bloom, Diane.

750
00:32:02,040 --> 00:32:03,840
Count and number the blooms.

751
00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:08,200
You can also upgrade that.

752
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:09,020
That's already sick.

753
00:32:09,020 --> 00:32:09,920
That's already crazy.

754
00:32:09,920 --> 00:32:13,560
Proflowers, they are a returning sponsor for us.

755
00:32:13,560 --> 00:32:16,040
We have all received flowers from proflowers

756
00:32:16,040 --> 00:32:17,680
that were really, really nice

757
00:32:17,680 --> 00:32:22,040
and they lasted a crazy amount of time.

758
00:32:22,040 --> 00:32:23,480
They sent me a new bouquet

759
00:32:23,480 --> 00:32:25,960
to celebrate this new partnership

760
00:32:25,960 --> 00:32:30,960
on the like two weeks ago this Saturday

761
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:32,880
that are still looking great.

762
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:34,240
I think they're cursed.

763
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:35,080
Yeah.

764
00:32:35,080 --> 00:32:36,240
I think they're beautiful

765
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:38,200
and I'm not saying that it has any kind

766
00:32:38,200 --> 00:32:39,520
of detrimental effect.

767
00:32:39,520 --> 00:32:40,720
They're definitely cursed.

768
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:42,560
Yeah, I'm really worried what happens

769
00:32:42,560 --> 00:32:44,200
when the last petal falls.

770
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:47,880
Yeah, in two years from now.

771
00:32:47,880 --> 00:32:51,560
So that's a great deal.

772
00:32:51,560 --> 00:32:53,600
You can also upgrade to 100 blooms

773
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:55,520
with a pink vase and chocolates

774
00:32:55,520 --> 00:32:57,960
for just 9.99 more.

775
00:32:57,960 --> 00:33:01,260
So, you know, 29.99, you can get that deal.

776
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:04,340
You can get that special price

777
00:33:04,340 --> 00:33:06,160
on your Mother's Day order

778
00:33:06,160 --> 00:33:10,180
if you go to their website, proflowers.com,

779
00:33:10,180 --> 00:33:12,300
click on the blue mic up in the corner

780
00:33:12,300 --> 00:33:15,160
and use the code MYBROTHER, all one word,

781
00:33:15,160 --> 00:33:18,360
and you will get that, the 100 blooms for 9.99

782
00:33:18,360 --> 00:33:21,040
or the extra special vase and chocolates

783
00:33:21,040 --> 00:33:23,040
for an extra 10 spot.

784
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:25,040
Great deal.

785
00:33:25,040 --> 00:33:25,880
Yeah.

786
00:33:25,880 --> 00:33:27,440
They're great, they really are great flowers.

787
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:29,920
Like, I don't know, like I don't,

788
00:33:29,920 --> 00:33:31,460
I'm not super into flowers,

789
00:33:31,460 --> 00:33:33,160
but game recognize game.

790
00:33:33,160 --> 00:33:34,080
You know what I mean?

791
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:35,680
These are some dank flowers.

792
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:37,280
They last forever.

793
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:39,520
Wow, and this deal is expiring soon.

794
00:33:39,520 --> 00:33:43,060
Yeah, it's, I mean, it's expiring.

795
00:33:43,060 --> 00:33:44,460
Friday at midnight.

796
00:33:44,460 --> 00:33:45,300
Oh, fuck.

797
00:33:45,300 --> 00:33:46,700
Yeah, so get on it.

798
00:33:46,700 --> 00:33:48,920
Get in there right now.

799
00:33:48,920 --> 00:33:50,360
So you go to proflowers.com,

800
00:33:50,360 --> 00:33:52,300
click the blue microphone and type in MYBROTHER.

801
00:33:52,300 --> 00:33:53,800
Now, go do it, don't wait.

802
00:33:53,800 --> 00:33:54,640
Go do it.

803
00:33:55,960 --> 00:33:57,880
Yeah, that's it for that commercial.

804
00:33:57,880 --> 00:33:59,180
That was a good commercial, Griffin,

805
00:33:59,180 --> 00:34:00,240
but now I'm fat.

806
00:34:01,800 --> 00:34:02,640
From the commercial?

807
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:06,080
The commercial was, I ate that whole box of chocolates

808
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:08,580
and now I'm fat.

809
00:34:08,580 --> 00:34:10,340
So help me.

810
00:34:10,340 --> 00:34:11,240
Someone help me.

811
00:34:11,240 --> 00:34:13,740
One of you two has to have some idea for healthy snacking

812
00:34:13,740 --> 00:34:15,800
that comes in a box from Nature.

813
00:34:17,300 --> 00:34:19,300
Well, I mean, you've given me so many clues.

814
00:34:19,300 --> 00:34:21,500
Mother's Day is just around the corner

815
00:34:21,500 --> 00:34:26,500
and Mother Nature has made you some snacks

816
00:34:26,620 --> 00:34:29,020
and you can get them in a box from Nature Box.

817
00:34:29,020 --> 00:34:30,940
Don't eat crap from the vending machine.

818
00:34:30,940 --> 00:34:32,740
Put down the Funyuns, Tubbo.

819
00:34:32,740 --> 00:34:36,280
It's time to get right with your health

820
00:34:36,280 --> 00:34:37,940
and Nature Box is gonna help you do that.

821
00:34:37,940 --> 00:34:39,940
It's like a subscription service

822
00:34:39,940 --> 00:34:43,980
and you pick new snacks every month

823
00:34:43,980 --> 00:34:46,920
and they send you just like a gigantic box

824
00:34:46,920 --> 00:34:48,560
of super healthy snacks.

825
00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:50,300
It doesn't have artificial stuff.

826
00:34:50,300 --> 00:34:53,980
It doesn't have high fructose corn or fats,

827
00:34:53,980 --> 00:34:55,380
transitive fats or anything.

828
00:34:55,380 --> 00:34:57,500
It doesn't have anything bad for you.

829
00:34:57,500 --> 00:34:58,460
It's basically air.

830
00:34:58,460 --> 00:34:59,300
Transitive fats?

831
00:34:59,300 --> 00:35:00,380
Trans fats, I misread it.

832
00:35:00,380 --> 00:35:01,220
It doesn't have any of that.

833
00:35:01,220 --> 00:35:05,420
Transitive fats, so if fat A equals fat B, then right.

834
00:35:05,420 --> 00:35:06,820
Sure.

835
00:35:06,820 --> 00:35:09,460
Yeah, no, that's a great math goof that you did

836
00:35:09,460 --> 00:35:12,780
based on all of the math knowledge you still possess.

837
00:35:12,780 --> 00:35:14,660
If A equals B and B equals C, then A equals C.

838
00:35:14,660 --> 00:35:15,920
This is transitive property.

839
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:17,460
Look it up.

840
00:35:17,460 --> 00:35:18,340
Wow.

841
00:35:18,340 --> 00:35:19,900
You really pulled it out there.

842
00:35:19,900 --> 00:35:21,500
And here's the great thing about Nature Box.

843
00:35:21,500 --> 00:35:22,940
Not only is it delicious, they've got great stuff

844
00:35:22,940 --> 00:35:24,780
like South Pacific plantain chips, everything,

845
00:35:24,780 --> 00:35:27,820
bagel sticks, BBQ kettle kernels.

846
00:35:27,820 --> 00:35:30,620
You know, Pro Flowers has sent me flowers three times

847
00:35:30,620 --> 00:35:32,540
and I've only got one free Nature Box,

848
00:35:32,540 --> 00:35:34,180
so I would really like to dip into some of these

849
00:35:34,180 --> 00:35:36,740
new flavors if you're listening in B.

850
00:35:36,740 --> 00:35:40,460
And they're gonna send you your first box half off

851
00:35:40,460 --> 00:35:43,420
if you use our hookup for you.

852
00:35:43,420 --> 00:35:46,540
It's naturebox.com forward slash my brother.

853
00:35:46,540 --> 00:35:49,920
Naturebox.com slash my brother.

854
00:35:51,220 --> 00:35:53,260
It's time to get into the swimsuit.

855
00:35:53,260 --> 00:35:54,860
It's time to get into the trunks.

856
00:35:54,860 --> 00:35:58,620
It's time to get into your Louis Vuitton bikini.

857
00:35:58,620 --> 00:36:00,740
And Nature Box.

858
00:36:00,740 --> 00:36:02,580
My ocean jeggings.

859
00:36:02,580 --> 00:36:03,980
Your jorts.

860
00:36:03,980 --> 00:36:05,980
My lake jorts.

861
00:36:05,980 --> 00:36:08,100
Get into your lake jorts.

862
00:36:08,100 --> 00:36:09,180
Stay full, stay strong.

863
00:36:09,180 --> 00:36:11,380
Go to naturebox.com slash my brother

864
00:36:11,380 --> 00:36:13,900
and get some half off snacks that you're really,

865
00:36:13,900 --> 00:36:15,780
really genuinely going to enjoy.

866
00:36:19,940 --> 00:36:22,980
Listen, I have bad news for everybody listening to this show.

867
00:36:22,980 --> 00:36:25,320
Your boss is trying to fuck you.

868
00:36:25,320 --> 00:36:28,380
Not literally, although probably,

869
00:36:28,380 --> 00:36:30,880
because once you get to that point,

870
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:34,020
the creep mode just like turns on regardless.

871
00:36:34,020 --> 00:36:36,700
But also it's your fault in a way for getting so healthy

872
00:36:36,700 --> 00:36:37,820
and right with Nature Box.

873
00:36:37,820 --> 00:36:40,100
You got super healthy for Nature Box.

874
00:36:40,100 --> 00:36:41,980
You smell good because you've been close

875
00:36:41,980 --> 00:36:43,740
to pro-flowers flowers all day.

876
00:36:44,640 --> 00:36:45,620
What you're gonna need to do

877
00:36:45,620 --> 00:36:47,860
is you're gonna need to download WorkLog.

878
00:36:47,860 --> 00:36:52,540
It is an app application that you can find on Android.

879
00:36:52,540 --> 00:36:55,400
And you can keep track of how long you have worked.

880
00:36:56,340 --> 00:36:59,220
So like if you think your boss is shaving hours

881
00:36:59,220 --> 00:37:02,580
off of your paycheck, WorkLog makes it quick and easy

882
00:37:02,580 --> 00:37:05,700
to track how many hours you actually have worked.

883
00:37:05,700 --> 00:37:07,520
You can see how much you've worked in a week or a month

884
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:10,000
or whatever the pay period is.

885
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:14,080
And you can use time-saving features like auto break,

886
00:37:14,080 --> 00:37:18,760
which figures out how many breaks you've taken in a shift.

887
00:37:18,760 --> 00:37:20,440
And you can do all that.

888
00:37:20,440 --> 00:37:22,020
And then when the old paycheck comes around

889
00:37:22,020 --> 00:37:24,640
and they're like, you worked 32 hours this week,

890
00:37:24,640 --> 00:37:27,220
you can be like, fucking check again, Barry.

891
00:37:27,220 --> 00:37:29,080
And then he will check again.

892
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:31,200
Please don't use this for evil.

893
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:33,220
Please don't use this to just stop coming in

894
00:37:33,220 --> 00:37:35,280
and then flash your WorkLog at the end of the week

895
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:37,420
and say, hey, I think I was here.

896
00:37:37,420 --> 00:37:38,260
My phone's at the-

897
00:37:38,260 --> 00:37:39,220
And your boss says, I'm sorry,

898
00:37:39,220 --> 00:37:40,940
I've never seen you before in my life.

899
00:37:40,940 --> 00:37:42,100
I've never seen you.

900
00:37:42,100 --> 00:37:44,700
Shut your fucking idiot mouth, Barry.

901
00:37:44,700 --> 00:37:45,780
And you whip it out.

902
00:37:45,780 --> 00:37:46,620
Well, okay.

903
00:37:46,620 --> 00:37:47,440
I didn't weep.

904
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:49,380
It says 40 hours, so.

905
00:37:49,380 --> 00:37:50,620
Anyway, that's WorkLog.

906
00:37:50,620 --> 00:37:51,660
It's on Android.

907
00:37:51,660 --> 00:37:54,340
Check it out on the Google Play Store.

908
00:37:54,340 --> 00:37:55,180
It's free.

909
00:37:55,180 --> 00:37:56,300
You have nothing to lose.

910
00:37:56,300 --> 00:37:57,140
Go get it.

911
00:37:57,140 --> 00:37:59,540
This next message is from Mike Vera McCann

912
00:37:59,540 --> 00:38:02,140
and it's from Angie Vera McCann.

913
00:38:02,140 --> 00:38:05,140
Angie says, Mike, happy one year anniversary.

914
00:38:05,140 --> 00:38:06,900
I'm glad that we are wifeys.

915
00:38:06,900 --> 00:38:09,300
I am also glad that we both forgot it was our anniversary

916
00:38:09,300 --> 00:38:11,980
until our moms sent us cards to remind us.

917
00:38:11,980 --> 00:38:14,620
You're my number one man with dishpan hands.

918
00:38:14,620 --> 00:38:15,940
I'm going to blame our favorite brothers

919
00:38:15,940 --> 00:38:17,500
for the tardiness of this message.

920
00:38:17,500 --> 00:38:18,500
Nice.

921
00:38:18,500 --> 00:38:20,140
Meet me in the smoochitorium.

922
00:38:20,140 --> 00:38:22,420
XOXO, Angie.

923
00:38:22,420 --> 00:38:23,620
That's nice.

924
00:38:23,620 --> 00:38:25,540
I know we said they could do that,

925
00:38:25,540 --> 00:38:27,180
but it does sting a little bit.

926
00:38:27,180 --> 00:38:28,020
It hurts.

927
00:38:28,020 --> 00:38:29,620
They blame us and it's not our fault.

928
00:38:29,620 --> 00:38:30,820
It also takes a little bit of the power away from it

929
00:38:30,820 --> 00:38:34,180
when you tell Mike you are blaming us for it.

930
00:38:34,180 --> 00:38:36,700
It's just we fuck this up so frequently

931
00:38:36,700 --> 00:38:38,320
that when we actually get it right

932
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:41,380
and we get blamed for the fuck up anyway,

933
00:38:41,380 --> 00:38:43,360
I'll be honest, it stings a little bit.

934
00:38:43,360 --> 00:38:47,040
Also, I should mention that if you're gonna blame us

935
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:49,200
for tardiness, it's probably best to not say

936
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:53,260
that you definitely forgot in your message, Moriarty.

937
00:38:53,260 --> 00:38:55,840
Nice try on the crime of the century.

938
00:38:55,840 --> 00:38:57,100
I don't think you're gonna get away with it,

939
00:38:57,100 --> 00:38:59,500
but we do wish you a very happy anniversary

940
00:38:59,500 --> 00:39:01,820
to both of you and we're so happy

941
00:39:01,820 --> 00:39:02,660
that you're still together.

942
00:39:02,660 --> 00:39:04,580
Please, you're our favorite celeb couple.

943
00:39:04,580 --> 00:39:05,900
Never split.

944
00:39:05,900 --> 00:39:06,780
Mangy.

945
00:39:06,780 --> 00:39:07,720
Mangy.

946
00:39:09,300 --> 00:39:10,860
I know, you mean Mangy?

947
00:39:10,860 --> 00:39:11,700
No, stop.

948
00:39:11,700 --> 00:39:12,580
Mangy.

949
00:39:12,580 --> 00:39:13,420
Mangy.

950
00:39:14,620 --> 00:39:15,860
What up, dog?

951
00:39:15,860 --> 00:39:20,020
It's your boy Jasper Redd, co-host of The Goose Down,

952
00:39:20,020 --> 00:39:22,140
along with Kimberly Clark,

953
00:39:22,140 --> 00:39:24,820
and some of y'all might be asking yourself,

954
00:39:24,820 --> 00:39:27,580
what the hell is The Goose Down?

955
00:39:27,580 --> 00:39:29,340
It's a comforted fool,

956
00:39:29,340 --> 00:39:31,900
and we want y'all to climb underneath it with us

957
00:39:31,900 --> 00:39:34,820
and snuggle up so we can fondle your ears and things.

958
00:39:34,820 --> 00:39:38,300
So come check us out at Maximalfun.org,

959
00:39:38,300 --> 00:39:40,700
also available on iTunes.

960
00:39:40,700 --> 00:39:41,940
Jill.

961
00:39:41,940 --> 00:39:45,020
I am a standup comic, but I'm also a youth pastor.

962
00:39:45,020 --> 00:39:47,740
Oh man, I hope you enjoyed.

963
00:39:47,740 --> 00:39:50,560
I hope you enjoyed our profanity section.

964
00:39:50,560 --> 00:39:52,740
I know there is much deserved stigma

965
00:39:52,740 --> 00:39:54,500
associated with Christian comedians.

966
00:39:54,500 --> 00:39:56,340
I wouldn't even consider myself one.

967
00:39:56,340 --> 00:39:58,820
I'm a comedian who just so happens to be Christian.

968
00:39:58,820 --> 00:40:01,000
I'm also a huge Bim Bam and Max Fun fan,

969
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:03,040
so that's just to show I have an actual sense of humor.

970
00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:04,860
How do I get people to take me seriously in comedy

971
00:40:04,860 --> 00:40:07,500
without completely hiding this other part of my life?

972
00:40:07,500 --> 00:40:10,040
And that's from Embarrassed in the Bible Belt.

973
00:40:11,040 --> 00:40:13,600
You know, my friend's dad is a standup comic,

974
00:40:13,600 --> 00:40:18,600
and his whole thing is that he does clean comedy.

975
00:40:18,840 --> 00:40:19,680
You know what I mean?

976
00:40:19,680 --> 00:40:22,180
And he gets so much work

977
00:40:22,180 --> 00:40:27,180
doing stuff at dinners and at clubs,

978
00:40:27,620 --> 00:40:31,380
and family kind of venues, that it's not-

979
00:40:31,380 --> 00:40:35,580
Yeah, I don't think standup comedy necessarily has to be,

980
00:40:35,580 --> 00:40:38,540
I mean, like Jim Gaffigan, for instance.

981
00:40:38,540 --> 00:40:42,940
Almost all of his stuff is super, super fam friend,

982
00:40:42,940 --> 00:40:45,460
you know, like the whole Blue Collar Comedy Tour.

983
00:40:46,700 --> 00:40:51,120
Not that I'm equating what you or Jim Gaffigan do

984
00:40:51,120 --> 00:40:55,180
to that atrocity, but it's not an atrocity.

985
00:40:55,180 --> 00:40:56,060
I fucking love it.

986
00:40:56,060 --> 00:40:57,980
I'm not gonna put on airs.

987
00:40:57,980 --> 00:40:59,040
Yeah, here's your sign.

988
00:40:59,040 --> 00:41:01,260
I think- Oh God.

989
00:41:01,260 --> 00:41:03,500
I think that if what you're looking for

990
00:41:03,500 --> 00:41:07,100
is sort of like work, like if you wanna work,

991
00:41:07,100 --> 00:41:09,740
I think that having a clean show

992
00:41:09,740 --> 00:41:11,500
and a family friendly show,

993
00:41:11,500 --> 00:41:13,140
you're probably gonna work a lot more.

994
00:41:13,140 --> 00:41:16,260
If you want acceptance, like you wanna be liked

995
00:41:16,260 --> 00:41:19,020
and well regarded by your fellow comedians,

996
00:41:19,020 --> 00:41:21,580
I think that like, they're probably looking

997
00:41:21,580 --> 00:41:22,980
for something a little edgier.

998
00:41:22,980 --> 00:41:24,560
I think if you're not pushing the envelope,

999
00:41:24,560 --> 00:41:26,500
maybe in that scene, maybe,

1000
00:41:26,500 --> 00:41:28,740
I don't know that scene very well.

1001
00:41:28,740 --> 00:41:30,100
Well, hold, let me say this.

1002
00:41:30,100 --> 00:41:32,140
I think it's probably a lot like music,

1003
00:41:32,140 --> 00:41:36,220
is you could do stuff that you think would be more mainstream

1004
00:41:36,220 --> 00:41:40,540
and more popular, but I mean, if that's not your style,

1005
00:41:40,540 --> 00:41:43,580
if that's not the thing you wanna do,

1006
00:41:43,580 --> 00:41:47,040
then I don't think it'll be as good as the stuff

1007
00:41:47,040 --> 00:41:49,220
that fits in with your personality

1008
00:41:49,220 --> 00:41:51,260
and your kind of MO, you know what I mean?

1009
00:41:51,260 --> 00:41:53,140
Like don't tell jokes just because,

1010
00:41:53,140 --> 00:41:56,020
and don't be edgy just to be edgy, you know what I mean?

1011
00:41:56,020 --> 00:41:58,340
I think go out there and make the jokes you wanna make

1012
00:41:58,340 --> 00:42:00,460
and do the show you wanna do.

1013
00:42:00,460 --> 00:42:01,380
That's true, Jeff.

1014
00:42:01,380 --> 00:42:02,580
Being true to yourself here,

1015
00:42:02,580 --> 00:42:03,800
I think is the best thing you can do

1016
00:42:03,800 --> 00:42:08,800
because if you are someone who does have a sense of humor,

1017
00:42:10,020 --> 00:42:11,800
is very open, is not sort of,

1018
00:42:11,800 --> 00:42:13,780
I think that the stigma you're worried about

1019
00:42:13,780 --> 00:42:16,700
is somebody being sort of uptight and stuffy.

1020
00:42:16,700 --> 00:42:18,180
If you're very clearly not that,

1021
00:42:18,180 --> 00:42:21,260
then not only are you gonna just be able to be yourself,

1022
00:42:21,260 --> 00:42:24,580
but you might change some hearts and minds

1023
00:42:24,580 --> 00:42:26,660
in terms of what being a Christian could mean,

1024
00:42:26,660 --> 00:42:29,660
which could be super, super cool, maybe.

1025
00:42:31,300 --> 00:42:36,300
I just think you can be anything and also be super funny.

1026
00:42:38,660 --> 00:42:41,500
The talk about trying to fit in and be like,

1027
00:42:42,420 --> 00:42:44,660
I don't think that there's a standard of what,

1028
00:42:44,660 --> 00:42:46,060
there definitely is a standard of what

1029
00:42:46,060 --> 00:42:47,300
a stand-up comic is,

1030
00:42:47,300 --> 00:42:49,280
but I don't think those are the stand-up comics

1031
00:42:49,280 --> 00:42:51,580
that anybody really likes.

1032
00:42:51,580 --> 00:42:56,400
Like I actually just went to this stand-up comedy competition

1033
00:42:56,400 --> 00:42:59,420
that's a pretty big deal here in Austin

1034
00:42:59,420 --> 00:43:02,380
that they get like 15 comics up on stage in a night

1035
00:43:02,380 --> 00:43:04,860
and they go through like 12 preliminary rounds.

1036
00:43:04,860 --> 00:43:06,760
It's called Funniest Person in Austin.

1037
00:43:08,020 --> 00:43:10,980
And of those like 15 or so,

1038
00:43:10,980 --> 00:43:13,940
there were like five or six people

1039
00:43:13,940 --> 00:43:18,060
that were just like incredibly funny, incredibly original.

1040
00:43:18,060 --> 00:43:19,680
You could remember their names at the end.

1041
00:43:19,680 --> 00:43:22,060
You could remember like the best stuff that they did

1042
00:43:22,060 --> 00:43:23,420
because they were themselves

1043
00:43:23,420 --> 00:43:25,620
and they weren't like trying to fit into this

1044
00:43:28,340 --> 00:43:32,180
identikit of like, I'm gonna tell a joke about my wife now.

1045
00:43:32,180 --> 00:43:34,280
Like there were definitely,

1046
00:43:34,280 --> 00:43:36,540
everybody else was kind of that though.

1047
00:43:36,540 --> 00:43:37,860
And they were the people who like,

1048
00:43:37,860 --> 00:43:40,220
they may have had some good goofs in there,

1049
00:43:40,220 --> 00:43:42,820
but they weren't, none of them like won.

1050
00:43:42,820 --> 00:43:44,220
Like none of them move on to the next round.

1051
00:43:44,220 --> 00:43:45,260
None of them were the people

1052
00:43:45,260 --> 00:43:47,060
that you really remembered at the end.

1053
00:43:47,060 --> 00:43:49,800
Like originality I think is the most important thing

1054
00:43:49,800 --> 00:43:51,780
you can bring to the table

1055
00:43:51,780 --> 00:43:54,180
in the stand-up comedy scene,

1056
00:43:54,180 --> 00:43:56,100
regardless of where you are.

1057
00:43:56,100 --> 00:43:57,100
If you're a Christian,

1058
00:43:57,100 --> 00:43:59,300
if your angle is that you're a Christian

1059
00:43:59,300 --> 00:44:01,900
who's willing to get raw and rippled,

1060
00:44:01,900 --> 00:44:04,340
I think that is going to be an angle

1061
00:44:04,340 --> 00:44:07,200
that you can exploit all the way to the bank.

1062
00:44:07,200 --> 00:44:09,380
Well, cause I think it's not only originality,

1063
00:44:09,380 --> 00:44:11,140
but also sincerity, you know what I mean?

1064
00:44:11,140 --> 00:44:15,700
Like I would never want to watch anybody tell jokes

1065
00:44:15,700 --> 00:44:18,180
that they didn't think were funny.

1066
00:44:18,180 --> 00:44:21,340
Like that just sounds like the fucking worst thing ever.

1067
00:44:21,340 --> 00:44:23,540
Just go out there and do your show, dude.

1068
00:44:23,540 --> 00:44:26,260
And you know, I like the aspect of your question.

1069
00:44:26,260 --> 00:44:27,580
I think it's interesting that idea

1070
00:44:27,580 --> 00:44:29,740
of like having to hide the other aspect.

1071
00:44:29,740 --> 00:44:31,300
Cause I could imagine a situation

1072
00:44:31,300 --> 00:44:32,580
in which you might be on a bill

1073
00:44:32,580 --> 00:44:35,620
with like three other comedians who, you know,

1074
00:44:35,620 --> 00:44:39,100
are not following the same lifestyle you do.

1075
00:44:39,100 --> 00:44:42,700
But I mean, don't, you know, don't be stuffy about it.

1076
00:44:42,700 --> 00:44:44,340
It doesn't sound like you would be.

1077
00:44:44,340 --> 00:44:45,460
And who cares, you know?

1078
00:44:45,460 --> 00:44:48,820
And other way around is if you are a youth minister

1079
00:44:48,820 --> 00:44:50,900
and you have, you know, a congregation,

1080
00:44:51,780 --> 00:44:54,440
if you are worried about them seeing your act,

1081
00:44:54,440 --> 00:44:56,340
then don't do stuff in your act

1082
00:44:56,340 --> 00:44:58,040
you wouldn't want them to see.

1083
00:44:58,040 --> 00:44:59,700
Or you wouldn't, more specifically,

1084
00:44:59,700 --> 00:45:01,440
you wouldn't want Jesus to see.

1085
00:45:01,440 --> 00:45:02,280
Exactly.

1086
00:45:02,280 --> 00:45:03,100
Cause he'll see.

1087
00:45:03,100 --> 00:45:03,940
He'll see anything.

1088
00:45:03,940 --> 00:45:07,140
He watches all your bits and he does keep copious notes.

1089
00:45:07,140 --> 00:45:09,140
He will tell you the ones he does not like.

1090
00:45:09,140 --> 00:45:11,060
He will tell you, oh, he'll be honest with you.

1091
00:45:11,060 --> 00:45:12,060
Oh, you bombed.

1092
00:45:12,060 --> 00:45:13,100
You bombed there.

1093
00:45:13,100 --> 00:45:14,460
You did very bad.

1094
00:45:14,460 --> 00:45:17,220
He is the most honest, but also like supportive.

1095
00:45:17,220 --> 00:45:18,820
You know, that's what I love about Jesus

1096
00:45:18,820 --> 00:45:19,660
is he'll sit there and go,

1097
00:45:19,660 --> 00:45:23,140
hey, the goof about the blue dog, totally killed.

1098
00:45:23,140 --> 00:45:25,380
But the one thing about the cold hamburger,

1099
00:45:25,380 --> 00:45:26,620
you gotta lose it.

1100
00:45:26,620 --> 00:45:29,440
Yeah, listen, my patience is eternal.

1101
00:45:29,440 --> 00:45:31,520
And even I was getting bored.

1102
00:45:31,520 --> 00:45:32,360
I mean.

1103
00:45:32,360 --> 00:45:34,940
You did have a few jokes in there about abortion.

1104
00:45:34,940 --> 00:45:37,420
I am gonna need you to just go ahead

1105
00:45:37,420 --> 00:45:38,580
and cut those out of the bit.

1106
00:45:38,580 --> 00:45:39,400
Thank you.

1107
00:45:39,400 --> 00:45:40,240
Don't think it's funny.

1108
00:45:40,240 --> 00:45:41,940
Love all the little babies.

1109
00:45:41,940 --> 00:45:43,980
Love all the babies.

1110
00:45:43,980 --> 00:45:45,740
Let's just say you're not on the right side

1111
00:45:45,740 --> 00:45:47,120
of history on this one.

1112
00:45:47,120 --> 00:45:48,640
Yeah.

1113
00:45:48,640 --> 00:45:51,740
Don't invite Jesus to come see the show.

1114
00:45:51,740 --> 00:45:53,620
Cause he'll find out about it.

1115
00:45:53,620 --> 00:45:54,460
Guaranteed.

1116
00:45:54,460 --> 00:45:55,280
He will find out about it.

1117
00:45:55,280 --> 00:45:56,360
He always knows.

1118
00:45:57,380 --> 00:45:58,600
He knows when you are sleeping

1119
00:45:58,600 --> 00:46:00,700
and he knows when you are awake.

1120
00:46:00,700 --> 00:46:02,480
He knows if you've been bad or good.

1121
00:46:02,480 --> 00:46:04,620
And he's not gonna do the two drink minimum.

1122
00:46:04,620 --> 00:46:07,020
Not even interested.

1123
00:46:07,020 --> 00:46:08,420
No, I'll make my own.

1124
00:46:08,420 --> 00:46:09,500
Bring me some water.

1125
00:46:09,500 --> 00:46:10,340
Thank you.

1126
00:46:10,340 --> 00:46:11,180
Thank you.

1127
00:46:11,180 --> 00:46:15,140
Do you guys want Yahoo?

1128
00:46:15,140 --> 00:46:16,580
Yes, I do.

1129
00:46:16,580 --> 00:46:19,020
This Yahoo was sent in by Drew Davenport,

1130
00:46:19,020 --> 00:46:22,780
Emerald member, level six Yahoo shaman.

1131
00:46:22,780 --> 00:46:24,460
Thank you, Drew.

1132
00:46:24,460 --> 00:46:27,380
It's by Yahoo Answers user Blondie who asks,

1133
00:46:27,380 --> 00:46:29,060
I kissed a guy a year ago.

1134
00:46:29,060 --> 00:46:31,060
Is his spit still in my mouth?

1135
00:46:32,580 --> 00:46:34,040
Last year I made out with a guy.

1136
00:46:34,040 --> 00:46:35,780
Is his spit still in my mouth?

1137
00:46:35,780 --> 00:46:38,420
Update, was his spit ever in my mouth?

1138
00:46:38,420 --> 00:46:41,020
Update two, I had sex with him too.

1139
00:46:42,220 --> 00:46:45,180
But you're more concerned with the spit.

1140
00:46:45,180 --> 00:46:47,360
Yeah, cause spit's super gross.

1141
00:46:47,360 --> 00:46:51,100
I guess it depends on if you've spit since then.

1142
00:46:52,660 --> 00:46:54,620
You're saying if you kept your mouth closed,

1143
00:46:54,620 --> 00:46:56,940
then you would have all the same spit from that night.

1144
00:46:56,940 --> 00:46:59,680
Sort of an extended version of like,

1145
00:46:59,680 --> 00:47:00,720
I'm never washing the hand

1146
00:47:00,720 --> 00:47:02,940
that I shook George Takei's hand with kind of thing.

1147
00:47:02,940 --> 00:47:03,780
Exactly.

1148
00:47:03,780 --> 00:47:04,620
Sure.

1149
00:47:04,620 --> 00:47:07,100
I kissed the inside of George Takei's mouth

1150
00:47:07,100 --> 00:47:11,160
and I got a full mouthful of George Takei's spit.

1151
00:47:12,260 --> 00:47:13,700
And then I kept my mouth closed

1152
00:47:13,700 --> 00:47:16,220
and I haven't spoken or swallowed since that day.

1153
00:47:16,220 --> 00:47:17,860
I am drowning, please help.

1154
00:47:17,860 --> 00:47:19,100
I'm drowning, I'm drowning.

1155
00:47:19,100 --> 00:47:21,740
I'm dry drowning on land, on Takei.

1156
00:47:22,980 --> 00:47:25,580
If every breath you take has one molecule

1157
00:47:25,580 --> 00:47:30,220
of Caesar's last breath, as we all know, that is true.

1158
00:47:30,220 --> 00:47:32,900
I would assume that molecules of spit

1159
00:47:32,900 --> 00:47:34,660
probably dissipate.

1160
00:47:34,660 --> 00:47:37,840
Wait a minute, why do you want to know this?

1161
00:47:37,840 --> 00:47:39,060
What are you asking?

1162
00:47:39,060 --> 00:47:39,880
Why is this person asking?

1163
00:47:39,880 --> 00:47:40,720
Yeah, oh wait, hold on.

1164
00:47:40,720 --> 00:47:41,980
Yeah, I wanna dive into this.

1165
00:47:41,980 --> 00:47:43,360
What situation are you in

1166
00:47:43,360 --> 00:47:44,960
in which you have to determine this?

1167
00:47:44,960 --> 00:47:46,500
Has to be Voodoo Curse.

1168
00:47:46,500 --> 00:47:49,900
Has to be 100%, no question, Voodoo Curse,

1169
00:47:49,900 --> 00:47:52,180
not even DNA analysis.

1170
00:47:52,180 --> 00:47:53,880
Or like a location spell?

1171
00:47:54,740 --> 00:47:56,420
Cloning?

1172
00:47:56,420 --> 00:47:59,220
You can't separate the molecules for cloning.

1173
00:47:59,220 --> 00:48:01,200
It can't be anything scientific

1174
00:48:01,200 --> 00:48:03,780
because you can't scientifically assess this.

1175
00:48:03,780 --> 00:48:06,240
However, if we are in black magics,

1176
00:48:07,340 --> 00:48:10,140
you wouldn't need numbers to quantify it.

1177
00:48:10,140 --> 00:48:14,380
You would just need the existence of the spirit.

1178
00:48:14,380 --> 00:48:16,260
Why do you immediately jump to black magic?

1179
00:48:16,260 --> 00:48:17,820
It could be white magic.

1180
00:48:17,820 --> 00:48:19,380
It could be like a eye.

1181
00:48:19,380 --> 00:48:22,420
If it was white magic, you would call him

1182
00:48:22,420 --> 00:48:24,140
and ask him for more spit.

1183
00:48:24,140 --> 00:48:25,860
But what if he's missing?

1184
00:48:26,700 --> 00:48:28,460
You think it's a location, okay.

1185
00:48:28,460 --> 00:48:29,300
So you're saying location spell.

1186
00:48:29,300 --> 00:48:30,180
I'm saying you're trying to find him.

1187
00:48:30,180 --> 00:48:32,580
You haven't seen him in a year and you're worried.

1188
00:48:32,580 --> 00:48:33,980
If you're gonna harness the power

1189
00:48:33,980 --> 00:48:35,700
of Yahoo Answers to do something,

1190
00:48:35,700 --> 00:48:38,100
maybe ask has anybody seen Doug?

1191
00:48:39,460 --> 00:48:41,740
Have not seen Doug in years.

1192
00:48:41,740 --> 00:48:42,580
Need help.

1193
00:48:43,900 --> 00:48:45,660
Voodoo Priestess, welcome.

1194
00:48:45,660 --> 00:48:48,060
I love Doug, does he have big tits?

1195
00:48:48,060 --> 00:48:49,700
I'm on Yahoo Answers.

1196
00:48:51,540 --> 00:48:52,380
Your Doug sucks.

1197
00:48:52,380 --> 00:48:54,780
Everyone on Yahoo Answers is 13

1198
00:48:54,780 --> 00:48:56,360
and doesn't know what tites are.

1199
00:48:56,360 --> 00:48:57,260
That's what they call them

1200
00:48:57,260 --> 00:48:58,740
because they don't even know how to pronounce that word.

1201
00:48:58,740 --> 00:49:02,580
I watch Doug every afternoon on Nickelodeon.

1202
00:49:02,580 --> 00:49:04,820
They don't, they don't because they're 14

1203
00:49:04,820 --> 00:49:07,300
and that's just not on the air anymore.

1204
00:49:07,300 --> 00:49:10,340
My parents let me watch MTV whenever I want.

1205
00:49:10,340 --> 00:49:12,180
If I kissed a guy a year ago,

1206
00:49:12,180 --> 00:49:13,500
is his spit still in my mouth?

1207
00:49:13,500 --> 00:49:15,900
I mean, your mouth is fibrous.

1208
00:49:15,900 --> 00:49:16,940
It's spongy.

1209
00:49:16,940 --> 00:49:20,120
Well, let's finish that question

1210
00:49:20,120 --> 00:49:24,140
with a second half of the sentence because blank.

1211
00:49:24,140 --> 00:49:27,180
Because all I can think is I kissed a guy a year ago,

1212
00:49:27,180 --> 00:49:29,180
is his spit still in my mouth

1213
00:49:29,180 --> 00:49:31,280
because I can hear his thoughts.

1214
00:49:32,780 --> 00:49:35,180
Or maybe you just want to know.

1215
00:49:35,180 --> 00:49:37,780
Just like, I just thought about kissing Dave

1216
00:49:37,780 --> 00:49:39,460
at last year's New Year's Eve party

1217
00:49:39,460 --> 00:49:40,660
and now I want to know.

1218
00:49:40,660 --> 00:49:43,100
Do I still got a little bit of Dave in my mouth?

1219
00:49:43,100 --> 00:49:45,400
Maybe do I have a carry, Dave, your spit.

1220
00:49:45,400 --> 00:49:47,180
I carry it in my spit.

1221
00:49:47,180 --> 00:49:48,580
That's even coming to me.

1222
00:49:48,580 --> 00:49:49,860
I was just kind of let you know.

1223
00:49:49,860 --> 00:49:51,740
I'm thinking about if your spit's in my mouth.

1224
00:49:51,740 --> 00:49:53,440
You want to grab dinner sometime?

1225
00:49:54,760 --> 00:49:56,580
Maybe get some more spit up in there?

1226
00:49:56,580 --> 00:49:57,420
Just food for thought.

1227
00:49:57,420 --> 00:49:58,860
You can put spit wherever you want.

1228
00:49:58,860 --> 00:49:59,700
In my mouth?

1229
00:49:59,700 --> 00:50:00,540
Mostly in my mouth, please.

1230
00:50:00,540 --> 00:50:02,840
Maybe this person is gonna see Doug again

1231
00:50:02,840 --> 00:50:04,980
and they need a conversation starter.

1232
00:50:06,100 --> 00:50:09,780
You know, funny, I was reading on the internet.

1233
00:50:09,780 --> 00:50:12,540
I don't remember if you remember when we kissed a year ago

1234
00:50:12,540 --> 00:50:13,420
and then had sex.

1235
00:50:14,460 --> 00:50:16,460
I think of them in that order.

1236
00:50:16,460 --> 00:50:18,500
But I did find out on the internet

1237
00:50:18,500 --> 00:50:22,060
using some social engineering tactics

1238
00:50:22,060 --> 00:50:23,860
that some of your spit is still in my mouth.

1239
00:50:23,860 --> 00:50:24,700
Isn't that funny?

1240
00:50:24,700 --> 00:50:27,500
What have you been up to?

1241
00:50:27,500 --> 00:50:28,660
I miss you.

1242
00:50:28,660 --> 00:50:29,500
I miss you.

1243
00:50:29,500 --> 00:50:31,020
Doug, I miss you so much.

1244
00:50:31,020 --> 00:50:32,500
I miss you, Doug.

1245
00:50:32,500 --> 00:50:34,580
We haven't spoken in a year, Doug.

1246
00:50:34,580 --> 00:50:38,060
And we haven't had sex in equally as long, Doug, or kissed.

1247
00:50:38,060 --> 00:50:39,820
Who is this woman with you, Doug?

1248
00:50:40,700 --> 00:50:44,660
I know that sex was kind of an afterthought, but.

1249
00:50:44,660 --> 00:50:46,140
Whose baby is that, Doug?

1250
00:50:46,140 --> 00:50:46,980
That's weird.

1251
00:50:46,980 --> 00:50:47,820
That's weird.

1252
00:50:47,820 --> 00:50:48,900
That didn't come out of me, did it?

1253
00:50:48,900 --> 00:50:50,400
Ha, ha, ha.

1254
00:50:50,400 --> 00:50:52,000
Oh, I'm bummed out now.

1255
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:55,420
Is our mouth, our mouths are just like,

1256
00:50:55,420 --> 00:50:57,900
that thing about Caesar's last breath has me thinking

1257
00:50:57,900 --> 00:51:00,340
like there's definitely everyone spit in my mouth

1258
00:51:00,340 --> 00:51:01,820
at this point in the whole world.

1259
00:51:01,820 --> 00:51:03,740
Griffin, do you want to be more disturbed?

1260
00:51:03,740 --> 00:51:06,060
Like people die and go back to the earth

1261
00:51:06,060 --> 00:51:08,260
and then that dirt and dust blows around in the air.

1262
00:51:08,260 --> 00:51:09,980
So there's dead people particles in your mouth

1263
00:51:09,980 --> 00:51:11,180
whenever you breathe in.

1264
00:51:13,540 --> 00:51:17,100
You're eating dead people every time you eat anything.

1265
00:51:17,100 --> 00:51:17,940
Oh, great.

1266
00:51:17,940 --> 00:51:18,820
Cool.

1267
00:51:18,820 --> 00:51:19,660
Cool and great.

1268
00:51:19,660 --> 00:51:21,900
You can, people use Caesar's last breath

1269
00:51:21,900 --> 00:51:25,780
a lot, but you could like, you could use that

1270
00:51:25,780 --> 00:51:29,260
for any person in any situation.

1271
00:51:29,260 --> 00:51:32,980
Like every time you breathe in, you're breathing

1272
00:51:32,980 --> 00:51:36,500
in the air that Hitler inhaled to sing happy birthday

1273
00:51:36,500 --> 00:51:37,940
to his nephew that one time.

1274
00:51:37,940 --> 00:51:39,780
Oh, and then you say something really offensive

1275
00:51:39,780 --> 00:51:42,140
and you're like, so that was Hitler's breath.

1276
00:51:42,140 --> 00:51:44,820
That was Hitler's, that was, oh, that was a little

1277
00:51:44,820 --> 00:51:46,200
Hitler breath molecule that came.

1278
00:51:46,200 --> 00:51:47,360
Your breath smells like shit.

1279
00:51:47,360 --> 00:51:48,200
It's not me.

1280
00:51:48,200 --> 00:51:50,900
It's the Hitler breath from the nephew's birthday.

1281
00:51:50,900 --> 00:51:53,100
You, every time you breathe, you're breathing

1282
00:51:53,100 --> 00:51:56,800
in the air that Neil Armstrong used to tell his wife

1283
00:51:56,800 --> 00:51:58,700
he wasn't sure he'd be able to go to the moon

1284
00:51:58,700 --> 00:52:00,700
because he had really bad diarrhea.

1285
00:52:00,700 --> 00:52:01,540
Yeah.

1286
00:52:01,540 --> 00:52:03,380
Did you know that?

1287
00:52:03,380 --> 00:52:04,420
That's science.

1288
00:52:04,420 --> 00:52:07,100
When Lance Armstrong confessed to Oprah he was cheating

1289
00:52:07,100 --> 00:52:10,880
that whole time he's, and now I get that.

1290
00:52:10,880 --> 00:52:13,220
I get fucking dirty cheater breath.

1291
00:52:15,020 --> 00:52:16,760
God damn it.

1292
00:52:16,760 --> 00:52:19,660
You know that big note in My Heart Will Go On

1293
00:52:19,660 --> 00:52:21,060
by Celine Dion?

1294
00:52:21,060 --> 00:52:25,060
Oh man, we got a lot, half my breath is that note.

1295
00:52:25,060 --> 00:52:26,780
There's so much note there.

1296
00:52:28,300 --> 00:52:29,740
She recorded that in a submarine,

1297
00:52:29,740 --> 00:52:31,980
so that's probably not, that air's been filtered.

1298
00:52:31,980 --> 00:52:32,820
And then.

1299
00:52:32,820 --> 00:52:36,080
And that was the only time she's ever performed the song.

1300
00:52:36,080 --> 00:52:38,740
She exited underwater via airlock

1301
00:52:38,740 --> 00:52:41,520
and then sank the submarine with a torpedo

1302
00:52:41,520 --> 00:52:43,060
that she fired from her mouth.

1303
00:52:43,060 --> 00:52:46,500
And she returned to her husband Prince Neymar

1304
00:52:46,500 --> 00:52:49,060
to rule over Atlantis forever and ever.

1305
00:52:49,060 --> 00:52:49,900
Yeah.

1306
00:52:51,220 --> 00:52:53,980
These men think they can infest our waters.

1307
00:52:54,980 --> 00:52:57,700
I will punish them the only way I know how,

1308
00:52:57,700 --> 00:53:01,520
by singing a beautiful song and then sinking their submarine.

1309
00:53:03,180 --> 00:53:04,660
I'm French.

1310
00:53:04,660 --> 00:53:06,900
This has been our most scientific episodes.

1311
00:53:06,900 --> 00:53:11,820
You are learning a lot this week, I think, from us.

1312
00:53:11,820 --> 00:53:12,900
We hope you've enjoyed it

1313
00:53:12,900 --> 00:53:16,000
and we hope that you'll come back for more.

1314
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:19,780
We're here most Mondays and the occasional Thursday,

1315
00:53:19,780 --> 00:53:20,620
apparently.

1316
00:53:22,140 --> 00:53:23,980
But we are here for you.

1317
00:53:23,980 --> 00:53:25,860
You can write us if you have a question

1318
00:53:25,860 --> 00:53:29,260
or you find a good Yahoo or just wanna say hi.

1319
00:53:29,260 --> 00:53:32,540
It's M-B-M-B-A-M at Maximumfun.org.

1320
00:53:32,540 --> 00:53:34,300
What's Maximumfun.org, you ask?

1321
00:53:34,300 --> 00:53:35,420
Well, it's funny you should mention that.

1322
00:53:35,420 --> 00:53:37,260
It's only the best podcast network

1323
00:53:37,260 --> 00:53:38,820
on this great blue globe.

1324
00:53:38,820 --> 00:53:41,180
There's so many other shows like The Goose Down,

1325
00:53:41,180 --> 00:53:44,060
Lady to Lady, Oh No Ross and Carrie,

1326
00:53:44,060 --> 00:53:46,380
International Waters, Judge John Hodgson.

1327
00:53:46,380 --> 00:53:48,460
I'm always worried when we do this

1328
00:53:48,460 --> 00:53:51,260
that if you did all the statistics,

1329
00:53:51,260 --> 00:53:52,980
there is one podcast on Maximumfun

1330
00:53:52,980 --> 00:53:54,280
that we've never, ever mentioned.

1331
00:53:54,280 --> 00:53:55,180
No, we've never.

1332
00:53:55,180 --> 00:53:57,260
This is to clear your insecurity.

1333
00:53:57,260 --> 00:53:59,220
Steve and Jenny.

1334
00:53:59,220 --> 00:54:01,580
Steve and Jenny, Steve and Jenny in the morning.

1335
00:54:01,580 --> 00:54:02,420
Steve and Jenny, Steve and Jenny in the morning.

1336
00:54:02,420 --> 00:54:03,240
Steve and Jenny, Steve and Jenny in the morning.

1337
00:54:03,240 --> 00:54:04,080
Steve and Jenny, Steve and Jenny in the morning.

1338
00:54:04,080 --> 00:54:04,920
Steve and Jenny, Steve and Jenny in the morning.

1339
00:54:04,920 --> 00:54:05,740
Oh, man.

1340
00:54:05,740 --> 00:54:06,580
But anyway, there's a lot of great shows there.

1341
00:54:06,580 --> 00:54:08,680
There are great forums that you can go be a part of.

1342
00:54:08,680 --> 00:54:10,620
There's a family waiting there for you to join them.

1343
00:54:10,620 --> 00:54:12,100
You're the prodigal son

1344
00:54:12,100 --> 00:54:14,280
and you should go rush into their bosom.

1345
00:54:14,280 --> 00:54:16,420
I wanna thank John Roderick and the Long Winters

1346
00:54:16,420 --> 00:54:18,500
for the use of our theme song, It's a Departure,

1347
00:54:18,500 --> 00:54:20,860
which is on the album, Putting the Days to Bed.

1348
00:54:20,860 --> 00:54:23,640
You can catch that bad boy on iTunes

1349
00:54:23,640 --> 00:54:27,780
or on, now that's what I call Music 15

1350
00:54:27,780 --> 00:54:32,060
or Suncoast Records at your local mall,

1351
00:54:32,060 --> 00:54:35,220

You can get on a boat with Kyle Canane

Just the two of you on a romantic ocean voyage.

1372

A private skiff with you and Kyle Canane.

1373

So go to boatparty.biz and get your boat on.

That's a new thing.

1376
00:55:27,940 --> 00:55:30,560
You're on a boat, remember?

1377
00:55:30,560 --> 00:55:31,500
From a while ago?

1378
00:55:31,500 --> 00:55:32,680
Sure, from Mad TV.

1379
00:55:34,220 --> 00:55:37,820
Yeah, great job closing out the show, you two.

1380
00:55:37,820 --> 00:55:38,700
Just a great job in general.

1381
00:55:38,700 --> 00:55:41,300
I think on this episode, you both really did great work.

1382
00:55:41,300 --> 00:55:42,140
You too, Griffin.

1383
00:55:42,140 --> 00:55:43,660
Do you have a last Yahoo for us?

1384
00:55:43,660 --> 00:55:47,620
Sure, it was sent in by level six Yahoo shaman Drew Davenport.

1385
00:55:47,620 --> 00:55:48,780
Thank you, Drew Davenport.

1386
00:55:48,780 --> 00:55:49,700
Uh-oh, dang.

1387
00:55:49,700 --> 00:55:50,700
He leveled up.

1388
00:55:50,700 --> 00:55:52,260
He's level seven now.

1389
00:55:52,260 --> 00:55:53,100
Good work.

Ha ha ha.

1393
00:56:01,140 --> 00:56:05,200
Who asks, what nationality is he, man?

1394
00:56:05,200 --> 00:56:06,040

00:56:39,520 --> 00:56:41,960
and I have a podcast called Song Exploder.

1408
00:56:41,960 --> 00:56:44,560
In each episode, a musician takes apart one of their songs

1409
00:56:44,560 --> 00:56:47,320
and piece by piece tells you the story of how it was made.

1410
00:56:47,320 --> 00:56:48,880
You get an inside look into the creative

1411
00:56:48,880 --> 00:56:51,120
and technical process and a unique view of a song

1412
00:56:51,120 --> 00:56:52,480
by hearing just the drums.

1413
00:56:54,260 --> 00:56:55,400
Or just the guitars.

1414
00:56:56,560 --> 00:56:58,640
Or say, just a Wurlitzer piano.

1415
00:57:01,780 --> 00:57:03,680
If you're a fan of music, if you make music,

1416
00:57:03,680 --> 00:57:05,320
or if you just like to learn how things are made,

1417
00:57:05,320 --> 00:57:07,400
come check it out on Maximumfun.org.

1418
00:57:07,400 --> 00:57:34,400
Thanks.
