1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:30,720
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:47,600
Hello, everybody, and welcome to My Brother, My Brother,

6
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:51,360
the mean advice show for the imaginary. I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy.

7
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:58,160
I'm your middle-aged brother, Travis McElroy. And my name is Griffin McElroy,

8
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:02,080
the youngest of the three brothers. The lips, the teeth,

9
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:03,920
the tip of the tongue. The lips, the teeps,

10
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:08,160
the teeps of the tea. I'm so excited to be here,

11
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:13,840
because I've been dying to ask somebody a question about Game of Thrones,

12
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:17,520
and I think you guys watched it, right? Oh, yeah.

13
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:23,680
I actually, you know I'm very vocal on Facebook about how I don't watch it because of,

14
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:28,960
you know, I don't like, I don't go so much for fantasy except for the fantasies of babes I have

15
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:32,560
when I lift so much weights at the gym that I fall asleep.

16
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:36,560
You can ask me any question, Travis, and the answer is gonna be,

17
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:43,200
we the fans have had enough. Okay, well, I stopped watching about,

18
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:45,680
I think it was like halfway through season three.

19
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:48,240
Oh. Two and a half seasons too much,

20
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:52,160
according to we the fans. So I need you to catch me up on what

21
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:57,360
happened, but I don't want you to spoil anything for anybody who is going to watch it.

22
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:04,400
So if you could just get me from about the middle of season three to the end of the series

23
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:07,680
without spoiling anything for the people at home, that would be great.

24
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:11,200
Right, just sort of broad strokes. Yeah, just broad stroke it for me.

25
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:16,160
Okay, well, I'll tell you this much, Trav. Uh-huh.

26
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:19,840
For a song of ice and fire, there sure wasn't very much singing being done.

27
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:24,560
Okay, that's why. Let me write that. I'll slow down. I have to write it down.

28
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:27,360
There were like 80 episodes or something in this piece of shit,

29
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:31,760
and as far as I can remember, there was only like one scene with singing in it.

30
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:34,960
So George, don't call it what you're gonna call it.

31
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:38,480
I would disagree with you there, because you didn't call it songs of ice and fire.

32
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:41,760
You said there was one scene with singing. Ah, fuck, you're right. Fuck, you got me.

33
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:46,320
All right, idiots, here's the thing. Ed Sheeran in it.

34
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:49,280
And he didn't sing, which is like his whole thing.

35
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:53,840
Drummer from Coldplay in it. He was in it?

36
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:57,920
Sigur Ros from Friends. Uh-huh.

37
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:00,720
He's in it. Ross from Friends is in it?

38
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:04,400
Sigur Ros from Friends. Are these problems for you?

39
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:06,160
I've sort of lost the plot on where you're approaching it.

40
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:10,320
Chris Stapleton is a country singer. He in it. Okay.

41
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:15,360
Is that making you mad, though? Aaron Rodgers in it.

42
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:18,240
So we the fans, do we like that or do we not like that?

43
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:22,400
We the fans are fed up and we've had enough.

44
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:27,680
This is my petition. It's an audio petition.

45
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:30,320
Now, several hundred episodes in the making.

46
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:35,600
It is an audio petition that I am submitting for Game of Thrones.

47
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:39,200
To what? Do it again. To do the whole show again.

48
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:42,080
To do it again. Like a reboot or just start all over?

49
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:45,840
Yes, start all over with a fresh take. Some of the things

50
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:51,600
will be the same. The cool shit. Okay, so keep the good stuff.

51
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:58,080
If you remember during my extensive, extensive sardonic

52
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:01,680
recap podcast, Lame of Thrones, and then in every episode

53
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:06,240
in the, I call it the roundup, at the end of every episode,

54
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:10,480
okay, there was one fucking cool shit thing.

55
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:13,040
Those are the things that should remain the same.

56
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:17,600
All of the things should change. Yeah, there were like three times

57
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:22,080
throughout the series where a dude's skull just got fully fucking crushed

58
00:04:22,080 --> 00:04:25,600
by a big man's hands. So super cut that shit together.

59
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:28,720
That's the series for all the skull crushing.

60
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:33,040
As I said earlier, I've been out of touch with the fans for a while now.

61
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:36,400
Yeah, we the fans miss you, by the way. Oh, I'll come back.

62
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:40,080
Is it that you the fans want it to be sillier or?

63
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:48,320
Hell yeah, and fucking sexier, and more ads. That's the main fucking problem.

64
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:52,880
I can't even get up to use this shitter because this shit doesn't take a break.

65
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:56,640
Oh, I thought you meant like native advertising.

66
00:04:56,640 --> 00:05:02,320
Obviously, I love these dragons as much as I love flaming hot Cheetos.

67
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:05,440
They for sure already have the native advertising thing covered in real

68
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:08,400
as Game of Thrones. So let's, I'll delete that joke.

69
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:11,280
The circle gets the square. There's a little two on the nose for my taste.

70
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:14,880
What do you mean? There's a scene in Game of Thrones where they're driving

71
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:18,560
a Ford truck across the icy wasteland?

72
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:21,200
Well, no, the Starbucks cup was very funny.

73
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:24,960
It wasn't from Starbucks. We the fans thought it was from Starbucks,

74
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:28,160
and then we the fans learned it's from a local coffee shop.

75
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:32,560
And also my queen, Dany, doesn't drink it. She drinks herbal tea.

76
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:37,040
She gets to be in the reboot, but doing more cool shit.

77
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:42,400
And she didn't have no powers. She couldn't get burned up by dragons,

78
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:46,560
and she had dragons, and that's good. But she's gonna have powers in the new one.

79
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:49,280
Bad ass. Which ones? Bad ass, dude.

80
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:55,760
Uh, fucking lasers, invis, psychic blasts, plasma blades.

81
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:59,200
Yes. All of them, dude. She's got all the powers.

82
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:02,080
Yeah, she can give the powers to other people, healing factor.

83
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:05,120
All right, let's get some, let's put some ink on the fucking page now, okay?

84
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:09,520
Because episode one, these two brothers, sister, they're boinking big time.

85
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:12,400
I would change that, by the way. I would make them not related.

86
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:16,240
Yeah, that's shit nasty. Get that shit right out.

87
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:18,080
But I think it would be a lot more approachable

88
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:20,000
if they were just like friends who were bonus.

89
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:24,720
It was so fucking gross that the people, and so lazy and sloppy,

90
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:28,880
that the people what done wrote the book, George, I think the guy's name is,

91
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:32,640
he didn't even realize that the same people he had screwing

92
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:36,000
when the little boy went to the window to enjoy it,

93
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,600
the same people he had screwing were also the brother and sister from earlier.

94
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:42,960
Are you kidding me? Yeah, that was just sloppy writing.

95
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:46,400
My sympathies to the careers of the TV show,

96
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:50,160
because they had to abide by that garbage, it's like so embarrassing.

97
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:53,680
I would also, in order, if I were going to rewrite the show,

98
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:58,320
along with making it sillier, I would make all the sex that happens in it

99
00:06:58,320 --> 00:07:02,080
way more consensual. Yeah, for sure.

100
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:05,360
That's so fucking badass. That part's badass.

101
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:07,040
So they're boinking on this tower, right?

102
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:08,560
And they're boinking and they're not related.

103
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:11,120
They're just like friends, but they shouldn't be boinking

104
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:14,480
because they have other things going on.

105
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:16,640
They're late for a dinner date and they're boinking

106
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:19,440
and people are waiting for them because they were supposed to meet a couple.

107
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:21,280
Exactly, exactly, exactly.

108
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:24,640
So the boy grappling hooks up the tower and gets up in the window

109
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:27,760
and is enjoying it. And he's like, cool, cool, cool.

110
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:30,240
I'm a boy. I'm a little boy. I've never seen this.

111
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:34,880
And then one of the couple goes over and kicks the boy so hard

112
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:38,400
he goes flying out of the tower. Keep that, keep that for sure.

113
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:41,840
And for that scene, we're actually going to just use the 300 kick.

114
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:43,760
Yes. The kick that they do in 300.

115
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:45,680
So we'll just like literally take that footage.

116
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:53,280
Every character in the first episode, every character is given a coin.

117
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:55,680
Yes. And they can use the coin eight times

118
00:07:55,680 --> 00:08:01,280
to do a 300 kick. Yes.

119
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:03,840
And they get no more. Yeah.

120
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:10,400
We'll have to make those eight kicks last for the entirety of the series.

121
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:12,720
Yeah. Can they trade them to each other

122
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:15,760
for goods and services? They can trade them to each other

123
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:17,680
like in John Wick. They can trade.

124
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:23,840
If you use up all your Spartan kicks, maybe you could babysit for your nephew

125
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:26,160
and he'll give you one of his Spartan kicks.

126
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:29,520
But those are the rules. I have one other small change.

127
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:34,480
The boy goes falling in and you're like, oh no, he's dead.

128
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:37,200
But then he comes up. He's on the roof of the DeLorean.

129
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:40,080
Pretty badass. I love that. I love that.

130
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:43,360
I was going to say Batman, but maybe Batman's driving the DeLorean.

131
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:47,120
Yeah. With my queen and our queen, the fan's queen,

132
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:52,800
Daenerys. Yes. And also, I don't know,

133
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:56,000
maybe Captain America's there. Maybe- Stop it.

134
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,080
Now you're making jokes. Now you're making jokes at me.

135
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:00,560
Okay. Let's just go back to where Batman was driving the DeLorean

136
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:03,520
and he pulls up and Bran, I think that's the name of the kid,

137
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:06,080
Branflakes opens the door of the DeLorean.

138
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:10,640
But this time he doesn't hit, he doesn't hit what's his face

139
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:13,760
in that face. Like he just says like, hey,

140
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:16,880
you accidentally kicked me off the tower. I could have died.

141
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:18,960
Yeah. And they're like, oh god, I'm so sorry.

142
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:21,120
I'm so sorry. You know how I get when I boink.

143
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:25,280
Yeah. When I boink, I'm just flailing everywhere. Legs akimbo.

144
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:28,560
They waited a really long time to put dragons in it.

145
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:32,160
So I'm going to have dragons in it from the beginning,

146
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:35,520
except they can talk and use ice lances. Oh, cool.

147
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:38,240
Yeah. And I think there's only like three dragons.

148
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:41,120
I would make there be like 500, 600 maybe, maybe more.

149
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:43,360
500, 600 dragons. And they reproduce

150
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:45,280
at an uncontrollable rate. Yes.

151
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:48,720
Yes. All the dragons are always pregnant in this one.

152
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:50,080
Yeah. And they have to be hunted

153
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:51,600
to keep the population down. That's right.

154
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:55,440
And I'd like to introduce a thing where in the big throne room

155
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:57,840
in the Red Keep, which we're going to find a way cooler name

156
00:09:57,840 --> 00:10:00,880
for something like Bloodcastle Storm Mountain.

157
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:04,080
Battlegetten. Battlegetten.

158
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:05,520
What? Battlegetten.

159
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:08,480
Battlegetten. Battlegetten.

160
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:10,240
Battlegetten. Is the name of the castle?

161
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:11,280
Battlegetten. Okay.

162
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:14,880
The castle's called Battlegetten. And then in the throne room,

163
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:18,640
there's going to be like 16 thrones. And we'll have the cool,

164
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:20,480
I guess we'll have the sword one, but that shit's play.

165
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:23,920
But they'll be on caster wheels and you'll, the king,

166
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:27,120
whatever gets to like push them and whoever wants to fight him

167
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:30,160
can like push the, and then if your throne gets knocked over

168
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:32,640
or falls down the stairs, then it's out.

169
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:34,320
Oh, I like that. I love that.

170
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:36,640
Maybe we make the throne a little more comfortable.

171
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:41,120
There will be a plush throne for sensitive bottoms.

172
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:42,800
I also, and this is a little note,

173
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:46,320
but I'd have the snake man beat the big rock man

174
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:47,280
in that one fight.

175
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:50,640
I didn't like that the snake man lost to the big rock man.

176
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:53,120
But the drive his head got crushed in such a cool way.

177
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:54,720
That's the one bad ass thing about this fucking show.

178
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:55,760
Oh shit, you're right.

179
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:57,360
The fucking cool thing that we will have.

180
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:58,240
Oh no, you're right.

181
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:01,040
This one's got 16 thrones, but at the beginning,

182
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:04,480
there's 17 people. And then after every round,

183
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:06,720
they remove one of the thrones.

184
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:08,560
That's an important game mechanic. Yeah.

185
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:10,560
And if you, again, if you fall down the stairs

186
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:12,640
and that you'd get our shoulder out.

187
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:15,920
If singer Ross plays and then eventually they stop playing,

188
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:18,560
it could take anywhere from a few minutes to a few hours.

189
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:19,520
But when they stop playing,

190
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:21,280
everybody tries to get into a throne.

191
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:24,240
And then they, whoever doesn't have one is eliminated by blood.

192
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:25,760
Yes. I love this.

193
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:27,520
It's good, right?

194
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:30,960
It's unlike, I guess we the people just need,

195
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:36,240
and we the fans need, if HBO would just sign off on it

196
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:41,920
or respond to our emails and tweets and tumblers and stuff.

197
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:43,840
Oh, sorry, one more tiny note.

198
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:47,840
I was gonna say more wolves, but what if they're all wolves?

199
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:50,240
What if they all have the ability?

200
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:52,480
I thought, oh, there's a separate coin.

201
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:53,680
There's a second coin.

202
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:55,600
There's a second coin.

203
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:59,520
Yes, there's a second coin that allows you to transform

204
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:01,440
into a werewolf 17 times.

205
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:01,680
Yes.

206
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:04,640
And you can all, that's all you get for the whole TV show.

207
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:04,960
Yes.

208
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:09,200
So don't burn one as a joke unless it's gonna be hysterical.

209
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:11,280
Yeah, if it's a really good joke, maybe.

210
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:12,640
If it's so funny.

211
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:15,120
Also, I would like to be a character in it.

212
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:16,720
I would not like to play a character in it.

213
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:17,360
Let me be clear.

214
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:20,080
I, Travis McElroy, would like to be a character in it.

215
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:24,400
Joe Mangiello plays Travis McElroy in Game of Thrones II.

216
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:25,120
They back.

217
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:26,640
I wanna make a cameo.

218
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:29,760
I wouldn't mind squashing Ed Sheeran's melon.

219
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:30,640
Hey, listen to this.

220
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:32,320
Hey, listen to this.

221
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:34,080
Here's your poster right here.

222
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:35,760
Here's the poster.

223
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:39,040
There's 500 to 600 dragons.

224
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:44,240
Ed Sheeran, Sigur Ros, Aaron Rodgers, all in armor, loving it.

225
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:46,960
The one guy is beating the other guy.

226
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:48,560
But on the other side of the poster,

227
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:51,360
it goes the way it did originally.

228
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:53,360
So both of those are depicted.

229
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:54,800
Just side by side?

230
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:57,920
In the series, both outcomes are depicted.

231
00:12:57,920 --> 00:12:59,200
Choose your own adventure.

232
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:00,320
Yeah, both of them happen.

233
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:01,840
It's a little bit for everyone.

234
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:03,440
Yeah, both of them happen in it.

235
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:04,880
And they all win.

236
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:06,720
And everybody wins in this one.

237
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:09,200
And in this one, and then at the bottom of the poster, it says,

238
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:15,200
let the games begin, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, again.

239
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:18,080
It's good, right?

240
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:22,880
Let the games again, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, again.

241
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:23,280
Yes.

242
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:24,080
Fuck.

243
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:24,400
Yes.

244
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:26,080
It's back.

245
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:26,880
Let's do a question.

246
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:28,480
Yeah, I love that.

247
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:29,200
Thank you, Griffin.

248
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:31,840
I'm sorry I got a little lost.

249
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:34,640
I'm in the doctor's office waiting room.

250
00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:38,720
They just called my name, but someone else got up and went back.

251
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:39,520
Oh, man.

252
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:40,880
I can't imagine that.

253
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:43,840
Now it's been 20 minutes, and I'm the only one left in the waiting room,

254
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:47,040
except an old woman who was parked by the nurse's door to yell at everyone

255
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:49,040
who goes in before her, you don't look sick.

256
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:53,040
Do I go tell them they made a mistake?

257
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:54,320
What if they're just busy?

258
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:57,440
How long do I wait before I become the same as this old woman?

259
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:59,040
I live here now, I suppose.

260
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:00,400
That's from Darned and Diver.

261
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:04,960
This feels like a piece of paper you find crammed

262
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:07,440
between two stones in the doctor's office.

263
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:07,840
Yeah.

264
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:14,320
That's so hard because it's really hard living in a society,

265
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:17,840
we can all accept that, it's a common theme of our program,

266
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:23,280
but it's especially hard when it just, it very clearly broke down on everyone.

267
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:23,760
Yes.

268
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:27,760
We can all agree that it broke down, and I don't know how you get out of that.

269
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:31,600
When it's hard to admit to another person in the machine,

270
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:35,760
like, hey, the machine's broke, and there's no recompense for that.

271
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:37,120
There's no way out of it.

272
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:40,480
This fear that I will infer here that you're feeling,

273
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:44,560
because I have felt this many times, this fear of like walking up and say,

274
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:46,080
oh, I think there's been a mistake.

275
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:49,120
I think I was, and they're like, no, there's no mistake.

276
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:50,080
You'll be back soon.

277
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:51,520
Just sit back down.

278
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:52,020
100%.

279
00:14:52,020 --> 00:14:58,580
Oh, God, there's no doubt in my mind that it's 100% verbatim tone and everything.

280
00:14:58,580 --> 00:14:59,620
They would sound like my brother.

281
00:14:59,620 --> 00:15:03,060
That's how sure I am that that is the exact response you would get.

282
00:15:03,060 --> 00:15:04,020
Just sit down.

283
00:15:04,020 --> 00:15:07,380
We're going to call you in a minute, and you're like, oh, no, I have to go.

284
00:15:07,380 --> 00:15:09,220
Because it's the doctor, right?

285
00:15:09,220 --> 00:15:12,420
If the doctor's like, we just let anybody back there,

286
00:15:12,420 --> 00:15:14,980
no matter what name we call, whatever, it's all bullshit.

287
00:15:16,660 --> 00:15:18,260
What else are they making up, right?

288
00:15:18,260 --> 00:15:20,340
What else are they just pulling out of their asses?

289
00:15:20,340 --> 00:15:22,900
Because you would think that if they called your name,

290
00:15:22,900 --> 00:15:28,500
if it was like Dan and somebody else went back and they weren't Dan,

291
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:32,020
that that mistake would be found out pretty quickly.

292
00:15:32,020 --> 00:15:34,100
Are they getting all your fungus medicine?

293
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:36,020
What if there's none left for you?

294
00:15:37,300 --> 00:15:39,620
Because they're eating it for fuel.

295
00:15:39,620 --> 00:15:44,180
They're eating all your fungus medicine and smuggling it out in their bellies.

296
00:15:44,180 --> 00:15:44,580
Now, let me say this.

297
00:15:44,580 --> 00:15:46,420
The other side of this, too, is also a bonger.

298
00:15:46,420 --> 00:15:48,260
That if someone calls Dan and someone's like,

299
00:15:48,260 --> 00:15:50,900
well, I'm Jim, but yeah, you know what?

300
00:15:50,900 --> 00:15:51,700
I'm going.

301
00:15:51,700 --> 00:15:53,380
I'm Jim, but I'm in a hurry.

302
00:15:53,380 --> 00:15:54,340
I'm Jim in a hurry.

303
00:15:56,180 --> 00:15:59,460
Flip side, there are worse places to live now.

304
00:15:59,460 --> 00:16:00,660
There are worse places to live.

305
00:16:00,660 --> 00:16:03,460
If you have a whoopsie, uh-oh, you're very close to somebody

306
00:16:03,460 --> 00:16:06,180
who can patch that right up for you, I hope.

307
00:16:06,180 --> 00:16:07,940
And all the highlights, magazines you can read.

308
00:16:07,940 --> 00:16:08,900
All the highlights you can read.

309
00:16:08,900 --> 00:16:10,660
There's the goldfish, probably.

310
00:16:10,660 --> 00:16:15,140
And then you have all those beads that you can push around on the little pipes.

311
00:16:15,140 --> 00:16:16,500
Gosh, those are freaking fun.

312
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:18,980
The hospital Sid works at has killer bacon.

313
00:16:19,540 --> 00:16:19,940
Yeah.

314
00:16:19,940 --> 00:16:26,020
And apparently, you have a new friend in a, sounds like very judgmental old woman.

315
00:16:26,020 --> 00:16:26,820
Yeah, let's get there.

316
00:16:26,820 --> 00:16:27,300
Let's get there.

317
00:16:27,300 --> 00:16:27,940
Let's get to her.

318
00:16:28,660 --> 00:16:30,500
Okay, what is she doing?

319
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:31,780
You don't look sick.

320
00:16:31,780 --> 00:16:32,900
That sucks.

321
00:16:32,900 --> 00:16:34,180
Well, it might be a compliment.

322
00:16:35,140 --> 00:16:39,060
It might be like, hey, I want you to know you probably feel really bad right now.

323
00:16:39,060 --> 00:16:41,700
And oh, thank God you came in to take care of yourself.

324
00:16:41,700 --> 00:16:43,540
I, listen, I appreciate it.

325
00:16:43,540 --> 00:16:45,140
I'm sure all your loved ones appreciate it.

326
00:16:45,140 --> 00:16:48,580
I want you to know, in case you were worried about it, you don't look sick.

327
00:16:48,580 --> 00:16:50,340
You look, you're not showing it.

328
00:16:50,340 --> 00:16:51,460
You look great.

329
00:16:52,020 --> 00:16:52,740
You look great.

330
00:16:52,740 --> 00:16:53,700
I hope you get better.

331
00:16:53,700 --> 00:16:56,900
Because I understand that sometimes illness is invisible.

332
00:16:56,900 --> 00:16:59,460
And I hope, I'm glad you've taken care of yourself.

333
00:17:00,260 --> 00:17:01,380
This old woman is great.

334
00:17:02,020 --> 00:17:02,820
Yeah, she's good.

335
00:17:02,820 --> 00:17:04,420
I have to, yeah, I'm with Trav.

336
00:17:04,420 --> 00:17:05,540
This one kicks ass.

337
00:17:05,540 --> 00:17:10,180
Did you think that maybe she was a bad egg maybe for a little bit?

338
00:17:10,180 --> 00:17:14,340
When you originally thought about it wrong, did you think that maybe she was kind of a bad egg?

339
00:17:14,340 --> 00:17:18,980
Yeah, like the pigeon lady in Home Alone 2.

340
00:17:18,980 --> 00:17:21,140
You can't just start talking about Home Alone.

341
00:17:21,140 --> 00:17:22,740
But I'm just saying, like when you first,

342
00:17:22,740 --> 00:17:26,100
because Kevin first sees her and he's like, oh no, she's a bad end.

343
00:17:26,100 --> 00:17:28,740
But then by the end, it's like, oh no, she's actually very sweet.

344
00:17:28,740 --> 00:17:31,700
Right, at the end when she kills two men by throwing a bird seed at them.

345
00:17:31,700 --> 00:17:33,540
Have a question from Yahoo.

346
00:17:34,420 --> 00:17:35,460
I love that Gryff.

347
00:17:35,460 --> 00:17:36,660
Here's one sent in by Graham.

348
00:17:36,660 --> 00:17:37,540
Roboc, thanks, Graham.

349
00:17:37,540 --> 00:17:39,060
It's a non, it's, no, I'm sorry.

350
00:17:39,060 --> 00:17:41,700
It's Yahoo Answers user Sebastian.

351
00:17:41,700 --> 00:17:50,020
Sebastian asks, how to make boiled eggs smell bad quickly for school.

352
00:17:50,820 --> 00:17:52,420
Huh, whoa.

353
00:17:52,420 --> 00:17:55,940
I have to take care of a boiled egg for a week and I broke it.

354
00:17:55,940 --> 00:18:00,340
So now I'm trying to make another one and it needs to smell bad so it's more believable.

355
00:18:01,540 --> 00:18:02,040
Why?

356
00:18:03,060 --> 00:18:03,780
For school.

357
00:18:04,820 --> 00:18:09,860
No, I understand, but is the question asker saying because I've had it for a week,

358
00:18:09,860 --> 00:18:12,500
it should smell like a week old boiled egg?

359
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:13,060
Yes.

360
00:18:13,060 --> 00:18:13,780
Yes, Travis.

361
00:18:13,780 --> 00:18:14,340
Yes, Travis.

362
00:18:14,340 --> 00:18:15,220
I'm just wanting to make sure.

363
00:18:15,220 --> 00:18:18,100
I didn't even think that part was particularly complex or nuanced.

364
00:18:19,860 --> 00:18:23,860
But that would imply that this question asker is afraid that when they turn in this fake

365
00:18:23,860 --> 00:18:29,380
boiled egg, this faux boiled egg, that the teacher is going to smell it.

366
00:18:29,380 --> 00:18:32,020
Yeah, your teacher is going to get that egg and be like, oh, that's fine.

367
00:18:32,020 --> 00:18:33,380
You can put it in the trash.

368
00:18:33,380 --> 00:18:34,980
Good work keeping it not cracked.

369
00:18:34,980 --> 00:18:35,380
Unless.

370
00:18:36,180 --> 00:18:36,740
Unless.

371
00:18:36,740 --> 00:18:39,940
Unless the teacher is a nasty.

372
00:18:39,940 --> 00:18:40,440
Oh.

373
00:18:41,380 --> 00:18:42,420
Give me that stink.

374
00:18:44,420 --> 00:18:45,620
Would you name your son?

375
00:18:45,620 --> 00:18:46,500
Yeah, it's Kenneth.

376
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:48,420
Give me that stink, Kenneth.

377
00:18:48,420 --> 00:18:50,020
Give me that stinky egg.

378
00:18:50,020 --> 00:18:51,780
This one doesn't stink at all.

379
00:18:51,780 --> 00:18:52,900
No points.

380
00:18:52,900 --> 00:18:57,540
You know, now that Griffin said it, I cannot think of another reason that a teacher would

381
00:18:57,540 --> 00:19:02,980
think assigning you to take care of an egg for a week is anything.

382
00:19:02,980 --> 00:19:07,940
Yeah, you can bury that shit in a hole in your yard and then dig him up one week later.

383
00:19:07,940 --> 00:19:09,300
Here he is safe and sound probably.

384
00:19:09,940 --> 00:19:10,740
I had to do it.

385
00:19:11,700 --> 00:19:13,780
Yes, but what did it prove, Justin?

386
00:19:13,780 --> 00:19:15,540
It proved that I was ready to be a father.

387
00:19:18,660 --> 00:19:19,300
It is not.

388
00:19:19,300 --> 00:19:22,100
Can I say that is the object of the lesson, right?

389
00:19:22,100 --> 00:19:23,620
It's hard to be a parent.

390
00:19:23,620 --> 00:19:24,900
Here's an egg to take care of.

391
00:19:24,900 --> 00:19:26,820
Can you imagine how hard this would be?

392
00:19:26,820 --> 00:19:28,500
One of the two things is going to happen.

393
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:32,740
One is the kid's going to do a pretty good job and be like, I'm ready to be a dad.

394
00:19:32,740 --> 00:19:34,820
I'm a very responsible 15-year-old.

395
00:19:34,820 --> 00:19:35,860
That egg looks beautiful.

396
00:19:35,860 --> 00:19:36,820
I'm ready to be a dad.

397
00:19:38,180 --> 00:19:38,740
That's one option.

398
00:19:38,740 --> 00:19:44,100
The other one is, like, the other problem with this is it is nothing like that.

399
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:45,620
It's nothing like it.

400
00:19:45,620 --> 00:19:50,900
Because I can take an egg home and put it in my sock drawer, grab it a week later, and

401
00:19:50,900 --> 00:19:52,820
turn it in and be like, yeah, I took it everywhere.

402
00:19:52,820 --> 00:19:53,700
I took care of it.

403
00:19:53,700 --> 00:19:55,700
But I can't do that with BB.

404
00:19:55,700 --> 00:19:57,060
Can't do it with him.

405
00:19:57,060 --> 00:20:01,380
Well, on the inverse, you could have a kid who drops their boiled egg and it explodes

406
00:20:01,380 --> 00:20:02,660
when it hits the ground.

407
00:20:02,660 --> 00:20:05,460
And then, you know, a few years later, somebody's like, you ever think about having kids?

408
00:20:05,460 --> 00:20:08,180
And it's like, well, no, because I know if I did have one, I would drop it.

409
00:20:08,180 --> 00:20:10,100
It would explode as soon as it hit the ground.

410
00:20:10,100 --> 00:20:14,100
So maybe if a kid wouldn't explode, we probably shouldn't drop them.

411
00:20:14,100 --> 00:20:17,380
Maybe taking care of an egg is harder than taking care of a baby.

412
00:20:18,020 --> 00:20:20,740
Okay, because babies can recover from a drop or two.

413
00:20:20,740 --> 00:20:25,860
Yeah, I'm saying my baby is surprisingly tougher than an egg.

414
00:20:25,860 --> 00:20:29,060
There is also the problem of like, if you get really hungry while you're watching your

415
00:20:29,060 --> 00:20:32,740
child, it's probably not going to occur to you to scarf it.

416
00:20:33,620 --> 00:20:34,740
It probably won't think to scarf the child.

417
00:20:34,740 --> 00:20:38,420
And if you do, you face way stronger punishment than just like an F.

418
00:20:39,700 --> 00:20:45,300
So I guess while you're handing it to them, do a quick burp or fart right on it.

419
00:20:48,020 --> 00:20:48,980
Here's what I would do.

420
00:20:48,980 --> 00:20:50,660
I would put it in vinegar overnight.

421
00:20:50,660 --> 00:20:57,780
The acid of the vinegar is going to break down some of the shell.

422
00:20:57,780 --> 00:21:03,140
That's why we use vinegar when we're helping to color eggs, because they break down some

423
00:21:03,140 --> 00:21:04,420
of the proteins in the shell.

424
00:21:04,420 --> 00:21:05,860
So put it into vinegar.

425
00:21:05,860 --> 00:21:08,820
It's going to break down some of the shell, and it's going to absorb some of that vinegar

426
00:21:08,820 --> 00:21:13,460
smell, and it's going to have a real gnarly stink on it, like a real rough stink.

427
00:21:13,460 --> 00:21:15,380
Are you worried that that might go the other way, though?

428
00:21:15,380 --> 00:21:20,020
That when you turn it, it's like, hey, I'm glad you, I guess, kept your baby alive, quote unquote.

429
00:21:20,020 --> 00:21:22,260
But also, why your baby stinks so bad?

430
00:21:24,020 --> 00:21:26,340
If you have a stinky egg, that's out of your control.

431
00:21:27,300 --> 00:21:27,940
That's true.

432
00:21:29,060 --> 00:21:30,660
Take it up with the chicken, my man.

433
00:21:30,660 --> 00:21:32,100
I don't know what to tell you.

434
00:21:32,100 --> 00:21:35,140
Ask the chicken's stinky ass why it makes such bad eggs.

435
00:21:35,860 --> 00:21:38,340
I'm just playing with the cards I was dealt, chief.

436
00:21:38,340 --> 00:21:41,060
Yeah, this is the chicken's ass, not mine.

437
00:21:41,060 --> 00:21:42,740
It's your nasty assignment, Devin.

438
00:21:45,700 --> 00:21:47,220
I'll see you Fortnite later.

439
00:21:47,220 --> 00:21:50,660
I can't, please, it's Mr. Pearson.

440
00:21:50,660 --> 00:21:54,980
I will see you on Fortnite later, but please, it is Mr. Pearson at school.

441
00:21:54,980 --> 00:21:55,860
Fuck off, Devin.

442
00:21:56,420 --> 00:21:58,660
Okay, you're the boss.

443
00:21:58,660 --> 00:22:03,620
Another option is you can rub the egg up against your mama's feet.

444
00:22:09,300 --> 00:22:10,660
You just got scorch mode.

445
00:22:12,740 --> 00:22:13,240
Boom.

446
00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:19,720
About three years ago, a colleague and I created a presentation for some high school students on

447
00:22:19,720 --> 00:22:21,560
behalf of the college where I work.

448
00:22:21,560 --> 00:22:25,160
The presentation involved handing out little pieces of dark chocolate.

449
00:22:25,160 --> 00:22:28,200
My then boss, who had a company credit card, bought the chocolate.

450
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:32,120
We ended up with a lot left over, but I kept it in my office in case we ever did the presentation

451
00:22:32,120 --> 00:22:32,840
again.

452
00:22:32,840 --> 00:22:38,040
Well, now it's 2019 and I still have a bag of chocolate in my office that realistically

453
00:22:38,040 --> 00:22:39,560
is never going to be used.

454
00:22:39,560 --> 00:22:44,200
Neither my boss nor the other person involved in the project works here anymore, so no one

455
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:45,560
else even knows they exist.

456
00:22:45,560 --> 00:22:49,800
The chocolates, when unwrapped, have a thin dusty whiteness to suggest they are past their

457
00:22:49,800 --> 00:22:50,120
prime.

458
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:57,960
I eat them occasionally, should I stop and save them for a future use that might never

459
00:22:57,960 --> 00:22:58,600
come?

460
00:22:58,600 --> 00:23:00,760
That's from the cocoa monster in Canada.

461
00:23:00,760 --> 00:23:01,560
Holy shit.

462
00:23:01,560 --> 00:23:06,520
I love that when you say, should I stop, the reason is to save them for some future use

463
00:23:06,520 --> 00:23:09,320
and not that they're over three years old.

464
00:23:09,320 --> 00:23:10,360
That they're molting.

465
00:23:11,480 --> 00:23:14,920
That white dust, before anybody tweets it, I believe it's called bloom.

466
00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:18,280
And it's a thing that if you see it on there, it means you're not going to be able to temper

467
00:23:18,280 --> 00:23:18,760
that chocolate.

468
00:23:18,760 --> 00:23:19,800
It's not going to melt right.

469
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:21,320
It's not going to temper well.

470
00:23:21,320 --> 00:23:23,240
But I don't think it means that it's bad.

471
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:26,760
I mean, I bet it has a bad taste of it.

472
00:23:26,760 --> 00:23:30,200
The flavor to it, I mean, it seems like that part would be bad.

473
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:33,880
And it seems like, I don't know what role the chocolate played in the presentation.

474
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:36,440
Again, a vital piece of context.

475
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:38,920
People, you have to tell us these things.

476
00:23:38,920 --> 00:23:39,960
We can't just guess.

477
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:44,040
But I assume the chocolate was meant to be a positive, right?

478
00:23:44,040 --> 00:23:49,720
The chocolate in the presentation is a net reward, I would assume, and not a negative.

479
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:50,520
Oh, you got it wrong.

480
00:23:50,520 --> 00:23:52,120
Eat this old ass dusty chocolate.

481
00:23:52,120 --> 00:23:56,200
Eat this old fucking baseball card chocolate.

482
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:57,960
This foul chocolate.

483
00:23:57,960 --> 00:24:03,800
I do like this ambition scenario, though, where you surreptitiously scarf all the chocolate.

484
00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:07,640
And then six months from now, your new boss is like, I remember

485
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:10,600
when I traded over this job with the old boss.

486
00:24:10,600 --> 00:24:13,400
They handed me a file folder that had very important information.

487
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:15,560
And on one piece of paper was just written, you know,

488
00:24:15,560 --> 00:24:19,640
Susan has the chocolate in case we ever do the presentation again.

489
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:21,240
I know it's been four years, but Susan,

490
00:24:21,240 --> 00:24:23,960
I assume you still have that chocolate like a responsible employee.

491
00:24:25,080 --> 00:24:29,320
And then you have to deal with the ramifications of Laura Scott.

492
00:24:29,320 --> 00:24:35,080
Yeah, I think that unless someone tells me, this is for my life.

493
00:24:35,080 --> 00:24:39,000
Unless someone specifically says to me, don't throw this away.

494
00:24:39,640 --> 00:24:43,000
I'm trying to throw shit away constantly all the time.

495
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:45,560
I think it's completely valid, this idea that you would say like,

496
00:24:45,560 --> 00:24:48,200
oh, I threw that shit away years ago.

497
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:50,040
What are you talking about?

498
00:24:50,040 --> 00:24:52,440
That's nonsense that you think I would still have that.

499
00:24:52,440 --> 00:24:52,920
No way.

500
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:57,560
Yeah, your office is in a chocolate storage company, is it?

501
00:24:58,360 --> 00:24:58,840
Oh, wait.

502
00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:01,080
Unless it is shit.

503
00:25:01,080 --> 00:25:04,360
Okay, so now we have a hustle on our hands.

504
00:25:04,360 --> 00:25:06,440
People are going to walk in there and be impressed about how long

505
00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:08,200
you've kept your chocolate in there.

506
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:11,080
And they're going to be like, well, now I know a safe place to keep my chocolate.

507
00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:13,080
And they turn it over to you.

508
00:25:13,080 --> 00:25:16,040
And then all of a sudden, snack fest.

509
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:17,560
And you know what?

510
00:25:17,560 --> 00:25:20,280
Maybe that's how you get that big raise you've been angling for.

511
00:25:20,280 --> 00:25:22,120
It's when your boss comes in and is like,

512
00:25:22,120 --> 00:25:24,760
we're probably going to have to spend money to buy chocolate again

513
00:25:24,760 --> 00:25:25,880
because we're doing that.

514
00:25:25,880 --> 00:25:26,920
Ah, what a waste.

515
00:25:26,920 --> 00:25:29,000
And you're like, no, actually.

516
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:33,000
Step inside my fudge-o-matorium, why don't you?

517
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:36,520
Like Dr. Fratorium's fudge-o-matorium.

518
00:25:36,520 --> 00:25:37,560
Step inside.

519
00:25:40,040 --> 00:25:42,360
Lick the walls, there's choco stains all over.

520
00:25:42,360 --> 00:25:45,560
I see there's choco stains pretty much all over.

521
00:25:45,560 --> 00:25:47,080
Can't give them a fun brand name.

522
00:25:47,080 --> 00:25:48,920
It's pretty bad, the fudge stains.

523
00:25:49,560 --> 00:25:50,520
Guys, bad news.

524
00:25:51,640 --> 00:25:55,320
I ate all my boss's chocolate and I don't have the money to buy new stuff.

525
00:25:55,320 --> 00:25:56,440
Oh, let's buy some chocolate.

526
00:25:56,440 --> 00:26:06,600
If we're going to buy chocolate, we need money, let's go buy some.

527
00:26:10,120 --> 00:26:11,560
Bad news, criminals.

528
00:26:11,560 --> 00:26:11,880
Whoa.

529
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:13,240
Yeah.

530
00:26:13,240 --> 00:26:15,400
Hey, all you criminals listening, I know you're like,

531
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:18,600
I can look at McElroy.family and click on tours

532
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:20,680
and see when Travis is going to be out of town.

533
00:26:20,680 --> 00:26:23,320
But bad news for you because I have ring

534
00:26:23,320 --> 00:26:26,520
and it's going to let me know if you try to break into my house

535
00:26:26,520 --> 00:26:28,840
and then you're going to prison.

536
00:26:28,840 --> 00:26:30,840
Yeah, also, I'm Judge Dredd.

537
00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:32,760
It's also important to note.

538
00:26:32,760 --> 00:26:35,720
And I've got a big dog and a little dog,

539
00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:38,520
but mostly the big dog is what matters here in this context.

540
00:26:39,160 --> 00:26:39,880
Because here's the thing-

541
00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:43,080
I'm better than a dog, I'm just offended.

542
00:26:43,080 --> 00:26:45,160
Because I was like, I'm Judge Dredd and I protect my brothers.

543
00:26:45,160 --> 00:26:46,440
And you're like, but I've got a dog.

544
00:26:46,440 --> 00:26:47,560
But I have a dog.

545
00:26:47,560 --> 00:26:52,600
No, in addition to brother Judge Dredd, brother Dredd.

546
00:26:52,600 --> 00:26:53,640
Now I have a big dog.

547
00:26:53,640 --> 00:26:55,880
Anyways, ring helps you stay connected to your home

548
00:26:55,880 --> 00:26:57,880
anywhere in the world thanks to HD video

549
00:26:57,880 --> 00:26:59,960
and two-way audio features on ring devices.

550
00:26:59,960 --> 00:27:02,120
It's one of my favorite things if I'm somewhere

551
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:04,200
and there's like someone rings my doorbell,

552
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:05,320
which is a ring doorbell,

553
00:27:05,320 --> 00:27:07,240
or just like somebody walks up in my door,

554
00:27:07,240 --> 00:27:10,040
not only do I get a notification from my phone that says,

555
00:27:10,040 --> 00:27:11,160
hey, someone's at the door,

556
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:14,680
but it also gives me a chance to see who came up

557
00:27:14,680 --> 00:27:17,000
even if I miss the notification,

558
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:19,960
even if I miss the ringing of the doorbell.

559
00:27:19,960 --> 00:27:22,360
And I can talk, it's a two-way communication.

560
00:27:22,360 --> 00:27:24,200
I can say like, oh, you can just leave that at the door

561
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:26,200
or like, no, thank you or whatever.

562
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:28,440
It's a great way to answer the door

563
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:29,880
even when you're not at home.

564
00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:31,320
I am a huge fan of it.

565
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:33,720
I highly recommend it.

566
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:34,840
Like I said, I have two.

567
00:27:34,840 --> 00:27:37,320
I have one on my front door and one on my back door.

568
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:42,840
One in his Parisian villa and Dredd's all over that one too.

569
00:27:42,840 --> 00:27:43,880
So don't even fucking think about it.

570
00:27:43,880 --> 00:27:45,400
Yeah, I'm one of my Zeppelin.

571
00:27:46,040 --> 00:27:48,120
And if you want to check it out as a listener,

572
00:27:48,120 --> 00:27:49,560
we have a special offer for you

573
00:27:49,560 --> 00:27:52,280
on a ring starter kit available right now.

574
00:27:52,280 --> 00:27:55,240
With a video doorbell and motion activated floodlight cam,

575
00:27:55,240 --> 00:27:56,760
the starter kit has everything you need

576
00:27:56,760 --> 00:27:59,160
to start building a ring of security around your home.

577
00:27:59,160 --> 00:28:04,200
Just go to ring.com, that's R-I-N-G,.com slash my brother.

578
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:06,600
That's ring.com slash my brother.

579
00:28:08,040 --> 00:28:09,880
Stitch Fix is the clothes one

580
00:28:09,880 --> 00:28:13,000
and they have decided to support us again.

581
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:15,800
And so I get clothes from Stitch Fix.

582
00:28:15,800 --> 00:28:17,000
I get lots of them.

583
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:18,120
Yeah, there it is.

584
00:28:18,120 --> 00:28:19,880
I get lots of them and they come in a box

585
00:28:19,880 --> 00:28:25,240
and they have a special person who has an eye out for me.

586
00:28:25,240 --> 00:28:26,680
And they're in the box.

587
00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:27,880
They're in the box.

588
00:28:27,880 --> 00:28:28,840
They pick out my clothes

589
00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:31,240
and then they ship themselves like a normal would do.

590
00:28:31,880 --> 00:28:34,600
And then I get the clothes and I try them on

591
00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:36,760
and if I like it, then I can keep it

592
00:28:36,760 --> 00:28:39,400
and they'll charge me whatever for it.

593
00:28:39,400 --> 00:28:42,040
And if I don't like it, just put it right back in the bag

594
00:28:42,040 --> 00:28:43,480
and then send that back free of charge.

595
00:28:43,480 --> 00:28:48,280
No, it is no skin off my nose when Stitch Fix sends me the clothes.

596
00:28:48,280 --> 00:28:50,760
And so I think you should do it too

597
00:28:50,760 --> 00:28:52,200
because I enjoy doing this a lot.

598
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:53,160
Every time I get a little box,

599
00:28:53,160 --> 00:28:56,920
it's like a little opportunity for a fashion statement,

600
00:28:56,920 --> 00:28:58,280
a personal change maybe.

601
00:28:58,280 --> 00:29:00,040
And also I don't do laundry that often.

602
00:29:00,040 --> 00:29:02,920
So it's like, yes, this will get me through Friday.

603
00:29:02,920 --> 00:29:04,200
So that's very cool too.

604
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:05,560
So I want you to get started today

605
00:29:05,560 --> 00:29:07,480
at stitchfix.com slash my brother

606
00:29:07,480 --> 00:29:09,240
and you'll get an extra 25% off

607
00:29:09,240 --> 00:29:11,000
when you keep all the items in your box.

608
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:14,680
That's stitchfix.com slash my brother.

609
00:29:14,680 --> 00:29:17,640
One more time, in case you didn't pay attention just now,

610
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:21,720
pay attention this time, stitchfix.com slash my brother.

611
00:29:24,040 --> 00:29:27,160

Go ahead, caller.

616
00:29:35,320 --> 00:29:37,640
Hey, I'm looking for a music podcast

617
00:29:37,640 --> 00:29:39,400
that's insightful and thoughtful

618
00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:41,480
but like also helps me discover artists

619
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:43,000
and albums that I've never heard of.

620
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:45,240
Yeah, man, sounds like you need to listen to Heat Rocks.

621
00:29:45,240 --> 00:29:47,240
Every week, myself and I'm Morgan Rhodes

624
00:29:52,440 --> 00:29:54,520
that has changed their lives.

625
00:29:54,520 --> 00:29:56,840
Guests like Moby, Open Mike Eagle,

626
00:29:56,840 --> 00:29:59,320
talk about albums by Prince, Joni Mitchell,

627
00:29:59,320 --> 00:30:00,680
and so much more.

628
00:30:00,680 --> 00:30:02,680
Yo, what's that show called again?

629
00:30:02,680 --> 00:30:05,480
Heat Rocks, deep dives into hot records.

630
00:30:05,480 --> 00:30:07,480
Every Thursday on Maximum Fun.

631
00:30:09,320 --> 00:30:10,520
Y'all want a...

632
00:30:11,240 --> 00:30:14,040
Hold on, computer's being weirdly slow for a second.

633
00:30:14,600 --> 00:30:16,200
Okay, I think it's better now.

634
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:18,200
Da, da, da, da, da, da.

635
00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:20,200
Da, da, da, da, da, da.

636
00:30:20,200 --> 00:30:22,200
Da, da, da, da, da, da, da.

637
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:23,560
D, da, da, da, da, da.

638
00:30:23,560 --> 00:30:25,080
I wanna munch.

639
00:30:25,080 --> 00:30:27,080
Squad...

640
00:30:27,080 --> 00:30:28,440
Da, da, da, da, da, da.

641
00:30:28,440 --> 00:30:30,280
I wanna munch.

642
00:30:30,280 --> 00:30:31,480
Squad.

643
00:30:31,480 --> 00:30:32,920
Da, da, da, da, da.

644
00:30:32,920 --> 00:30:34,520
Bweh, bweh, bweh.

645
00:30:34,520 --> 00:30:36,280
There's hope for the Munch Squad still.

646
00:30:36,280 --> 00:30:38,600
I thought it was winding down

647
00:30:38,600 --> 00:30:40,520
but then I remembered that, you know,

648
00:30:40,520 --> 00:30:42,680
it's not just about current players

649
00:30:42,680 --> 00:30:44,280
in the fast-casual market.

650
00:30:44,280 --> 00:30:49,280
We've got new people lining up to join every single,

651
00:30:50,920 --> 00:30:52,000
well not day.

652
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:52,840
That's ridiculous.

653
00:30:52,840 --> 00:30:54,440
That would be so shitty.

654
00:30:54,440 --> 00:30:55,280
Can you imagine?

655
00:30:55,280 --> 00:30:56,600
Here's a quick fact.

656
00:30:56,600 --> 00:31:00,800
A Carl Jr. slash Hardee's Western Bacon Cheeseburger

657
00:31:00,800 --> 00:31:04,680
is sold every 1.13 seconds.

658
00:31:04,680 --> 00:31:05,520
Oh wow.

659
00:31:05,520 --> 00:31:07,720
That's a Munch Squad quick fact for you.

660
00:31:07,720 --> 00:31:11,160
About once a second they sell one of these bad boys.

661
00:31:11,160 --> 00:31:12,760
They did some fries about it.

662
00:31:12,760 --> 00:31:13,960
You can Google it.

663
00:31:13,960 --> 00:31:15,040
This isn't about them.

664
00:31:15,040 --> 00:31:16,560
This is about Earl of Sandwich,

665
00:31:16,560 --> 00:31:20,440
a fast casual restaurant franchise.

666
00:31:20,440 --> 00:31:21,880
That was a wild way of saying that.

667
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:23,560
I'll never be able to say that again.

668
00:31:23,560 --> 00:31:26,120
Franchise, co-founded by a...

669
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:28,840
What?

670
00:31:28,840 --> 00:31:29,980
Co-founded by a direct descendant

671
00:31:29,980 --> 00:31:31,640
of the actual Earl of Sandwich.

672
00:31:31,640 --> 00:31:35,600
Oh man, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

673
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:36,440
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

674
00:31:36,440 --> 00:31:38,320
It's in his blood.

675
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:41,920
This restaurant, this new restaurant,

676
00:31:41,920 --> 00:31:45,560
is a part of the more than five acre Fast Eddie's campus

677
00:31:45,560 --> 00:31:49,940
on Eagle Road, which already includes a Chevron gas station,

678
00:31:49,940 --> 00:31:54,440
a convenience store, a car wash, and a lube shop.

679
00:31:54,440 --> 00:31:56,520
The entire complex is owned and operated

680
00:31:56,520 --> 00:31:59,560
by local entrepreneurs Steve and Tracy Eddie,

681
00:31:59,560 --> 00:32:01,040
who previously built and sold a chain

682
00:32:01,040 --> 00:32:03,320
of fuel and convenience stores in the Treasure Valley.

683
00:32:03,320 --> 00:32:05,160
This is in Idaho, by the way.

684
00:32:05,160 --> 00:32:06,640
If none of this is making sense to you,

685
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:08,840
it's because it's like it's all in Idaho.

686
00:32:08,840 --> 00:32:09,760
Here's a quote.

687
00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:12,480
We wanted to find a restaurant concept unlike any other

688
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:15,480
in the area, and Earl of Sandwich fit the bill.

689
00:32:15,480 --> 00:32:18,040
Earl of Sandwich appeals to the modern consumer.

690
00:32:18,040 --> 00:32:19,600
Those who believe that sandwiches

691
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:21,480
are more than a convenience food,

692
00:32:21,480 --> 00:32:25,360
they should be carefully crafted and thoroughly enjoyed.

693
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:27,640
Weird, says Steve. And what?

694
00:32:27,640 --> 00:32:29,240
Thoroughly enjoyed.

695
00:32:29,240 --> 00:32:34,240
We are thrilled to add Earl of Sandwich to our facility

696
00:32:35,240 --> 00:32:38,240
and are confident it will become the sandwich of choice

697
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:40,280
for everyone in the community.

698
00:32:40,280 --> 00:32:44,680
Hey, so just so I can get this hunk of shit straight,

699
00:32:44,680 --> 00:32:47,440
they said that they said,

700
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:51,760
they said they wanted to think of an idea

701
00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:54,000
that no one had ever done.

702
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,200
And Michael, oh, we're revolutioning the idea

703
00:32:56,200 --> 00:32:57,680
of a quick service restaurant.

704
00:32:57,680 --> 00:33:00,600
So we went with sandwiches.

705
00:33:00,600 --> 00:33:03,840
Sandwiches made by a fucking king, Travis.

706
00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:07,400
Sandwiches made by literal, actual royalty.

707
00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:10,040
I've eaten at Lord Quiznos.

708
00:33:10,040 --> 00:33:11,520
This is one of the wildest paragraphs

709
00:33:11,520 --> 00:33:12,840
in the Much Quite history.

710
00:33:12,840 --> 00:33:15,520
The Earl of Sandwich concept revolves around the story

711
00:33:15,520 --> 00:33:19,280
of John Montague, the fourth Earl of Sandwich.

712
00:33:19,280 --> 00:33:21,480
He was a British nobleman, an avid gambler

713
00:33:21,480 --> 00:33:23,120
who, not wanting to leave the cart table to eat,

714
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:25,320
asked for a serving of roast beef

715
00:33:25,320 --> 00:33:27,920
to be placed between two slices of bread

716
00:33:27,920 --> 00:33:29,600
so he could eat with his hands.

717
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:31,960
Thus, the sandwich was born in 1762.

718
00:33:31,960 --> 00:33:36,960
Some 242 years later, Lord John Montague,

719
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:41,200
the 11th Earl of Sandwich and direct descendant

720
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:43,520
of the inventor of the sandwich,

721
00:33:43,520 --> 00:33:47,360
partnered with Robert Earl, not an Earl, but Robert Earl.

722
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:52,160
Robert Earl of Earl of Sandwich.

723
00:33:52,160 --> 00:33:56,240
Earl, who is the founder and CEO of Planet Hollywood,

724
00:33:56,240 --> 00:34:00,120
to reclaim and reinvent the greatest of all quick food.

725
00:34:00,120 --> 00:34:03,200
So you think for like 242 years,

726
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:05,760
everyone in this dude's fucking family is like,

727
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:08,600
can we not talk about sandwiches?

728
00:34:08,600 --> 00:34:12,200
We did it one time, we made up a snack,

729
00:34:12,200 --> 00:34:14,200
and that's our whole fucking thing.

730
00:34:14,200 --> 00:34:17,000
And then this guy's like,

731
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:19,000
but this guy was like,

732
00:34:20,280 --> 00:34:23,440
maybe we're gonna go ahead and just capitalize on this

733
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:28,000
because it seems to be the best thing that we got going.

734
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:31,960
I think the play here, you open this one in Idaho,

735
00:34:31,960 --> 00:34:35,960
it's not very successful, but you have a claim

736
00:34:35,960 --> 00:34:40,960
to the yeasted throne in the sense that fucking,

737
00:34:41,080 --> 00:34:42,740
you invented the sandwich.

738
00:34:42,740 --> 00:34:45,720
So sorry, Subway, sorry, Quizno, sorry, Jimmy John.

739
00:34:45,720 --> 00:34:47,000
Your ass is mine now.

740
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:51,400
There's no more sandwiches for you because I made them.

741
00:34:51,400 --> 00:34:53,360
Well, my great, great granddaddy made them.

742
00:34:53,360 --> 00:34:55,960
But still, that's copyright infringement, I think.

743
00:34:55,960 --> 00:34:57,240
Ooh.

744
00:34:57,240 --> 00:34:58,080
Right?

745
00:34:58,080 --> 00:35:00,640
Ooh, yeah, nobody else can make sandwiches.

746
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:02,520
You can't call them this anymore.

747
00:35:02,520 --> 00:35:05,340
Bread boats, I don't know.

748
00:35:05,340 --> 00:35:07,040
They'd find some way, wouldn't they?

749
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:09,600
Subway would be like, we're serving them

750
00:35:09,600 --> 00:35:12,120
in between two butt cheeks.

751
00:35:12,120 --> 00:35:14,180
Get on over to Subway now, baby.

752
00:35:15,080 --> 00:35:16,720
Do you think that when-

753
00:35:16,720 --> 00:35:18,080
Do you eat ass?

754
00:35:18,080 --> 00:35:19,520
It's a $5 ass.

755
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:21,680
Come on, $5 foot ass, get in it.

756
00:35:22,600 --> 00:35:25,960
Do you think when John Montague showed up at this chain-

757
00:35:25,960 --> 00:35:27,160
Sorry, Lord John Montague?

758
00:35:27,160 --> 00:35:29,800
Lord John Montague, the 11th Earl of Sandwich,

759
00:35:29,800 --> 00:35:30,640
showed up at this chain.

760
00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:33,360
He was like, uh-huh, good, good.

761
00:35:33,360 --> 00:35:35,000
The Earl's Club, I love that.

762
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:37,220
The original 1762 with roasted beef.

763
00:35:37,220 --> 00:35:38,640
They say roasted beef.

764
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:40,120
Fuck off.

765
00:35:41,080 --> 00:35:42,840
French dip, very good.

766
00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:44,000
The holiday turkey.

767
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,200
Does this one have cornbread stuffing on it?

768
00:35:46,200 --> 00:35:47,040
Excellent.

769
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:48,000
A delicious sandwich.

770
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:49,440
You've done my family pr-

771
00:35:50,680 --> 00:35:51,520
Wait.

772
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:53,620
Wait a minute, is that?

773
00:35:55,160 --> 00:35:57,880
Is that a quinoa chicken salad?

774
00:35:57,880 --> 00:36:02,640
What, a salad with, what is this, quinoa?

775
00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:03,920
I think it's quinoa.

776
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:05,680
It's a salad, just a regular,

777
00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:08,440
and he just starts flipping like bowls of salad

778
00:36:08,440 --> 00:36:09,400
out of the ground.

779
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:11,080
Is this, what's this over here?

780
00:36:11,080 --> 00:36:13,840
Pepperoni pizza bread?

781
00:36:13,840 --> 00:36:16,160
Macaroni and cheese?

782
00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:18,280
No, get it all out.

783
00:36:18,280 --> 00:36:19,120
All of it.

784
00:36:19,120 --> 00:36:20,960
It is not, but it's two slices.

785
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:24,080
I cannot eat it with my hands.

786
00:36:24,080 --> 00:36:26,760
Chips and potatoes.

787
00:36:26,760 --> 00:36:28,680
Get it out.

788
00:36:28,680 --> 00:36:30,840
Maybe perhaps the chipped potatoes

789
00:36:30,840 --> 00:36:33,760
will return two slices of bread.

790
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:36,360
This potato salad claims to be salad,

791
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:38,940
but it has no bearing.

792
00:36:38,940 --> 00:36:40,440
I'm just saying this all looks really good

793
00:36:40,440 --> 00:36:41,280
and I'm pretty hungry right now.

794
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:43,000
I did kind of like that holiday turkey

795
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:43,840
with the cornbread stuffing.

796
00:36:43,840 --> 00:36:45,380
Yeah, sounds promising.

797
00:36:45,380 --> 00:36:48,760
This all looks really good.

798
00:36:48,760 --> 00:36:50,000
How about a Yahoo?

799
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:50,840
Yep.

800
00:36:50,840 --> 00:36:52,720
This one was sent in by, also by Graham Roebuck.

801
00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:53,560
Thank you, Graham.

802
00:36:53,560 --> 00:36:54,660
It's an anonymous Yahoo answers user.

803
00:36:54,660 --> 00:36:56,840
I'm going to call Beverly.

804
00:36:56,840 --> 00:37:01,280
Asks, how can I talk my dad into letting me have

805
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:04,680
a 175 gallon aquarium?

806
00:37:06,540 --> 00:37:08,940
I don't know how big that is.

807
00:37:08,940 --> 00:37:10,360
I don't know how big that is.

808
00:37:10,360 --> 00:37:11,680
You know how when you're a kid,

809
00:37:11,680 --> 00:37:13,320
you had like a gallon of water

810
00:37:13,320 --> 00:37:16,320
and you like poured it into like a pool or a bathtub

811
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:18,720
and it was fucking nothing?

812
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:22,040
Like I don't know how big 175 gallons is.

813
00:37:22,040 --> 00:37:24,080
Can you guys, can we Google it?

814
00:37:24,080 --> 00:37:26,300
It feels like that's important.

815
00:37:26,300 --> 00:37:27,140
Because here's the thing.

816
00:37:27,140 --> 00:37:27,960
Oh, you don't want to do that.

817
00:37:27,960 --> 00:37:28,800
Okay.

818
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:33,380
To Griffin's point, if I picture 175 gallon jugs of water,

819
00:37:33,380 --> 00:37:34,620
I would look at it and be like,

820
00:37:34,620 --> 00:37:37,200
wow, that's a lot of water, right?

821
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:40,440
But I do have a strong suspicion

822
00:37:40,440 --> 00:37:42,560
that if you showed me one container

823
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:44,440
that could contain 175 gallons,

824
00:37:44,440 --> 00:37:45,880
I'd be like, that's not nearly as big

825
00:37:45,880 --> 00:37:46,720
as I thought it would be.

826
00:37:46,720 --> 00:37:48,280
I'll tell you boys, I'll tell you.

827
00:37:48,280 --> 00:37:52,880
175 liquid gallons is 23.3941 cubic feet.

828
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:55,480
Now, how fucking big is that?

829
00:37:55,480 --> 00:37:56,640
I don't know how big that is.

830
00:37:56,640 --> 00:37:57,480
I don't know how big that is.

831
00:37:57,480 --> 00:37:59,120
Okay, I just Googled it.

832
00:37:59,120 --> 00:38:02,680
It's 100%, 100% coffin-sized.

833
00:38:02,680 --> 00:38:05,800
Exactly on the nose, this is coffin-sized.

834
00:38:05,800 --> 00:38:06,640
Okay.

835
00:38:06,640 --> 00:38:07,520
And it even auto-filled.

836
00:38:07,520 --> 00:38:12,520
As I typed it up, I Googled, I typed 175 space G

837
00:38:12,560 --> 00:38:14,520
and it was like Alan fish tank.

838
00:38:15,880 --> 00:38:18,320
So this is a big, well, it depends.

839
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:19,840
I've seen bigger fish tanks.

840
00:38:19,840 --> 00:38:21,160
At the aquarium, they have the one

841
00:38:21,160 --> 00:38:23,640
that's just like bigger than my freaking house, man.

842
00:38:23,640 --> 00:38:25,520
Not for home use, you haven't.

843
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:27,000
You have not seen one for home use

844
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:28,560
that's bigger than this bad boy.

845
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:30,120
I guess it's a pretty big one.

846
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:33,760
This feels like something that you would need to have

847
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:36,720
at a restaurant so kids could look at it

848
00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:39,720
while you waited for your chair.

849
00:38:39,720 --> 00:38:43,360
Or alternatively, we're trying to convince the dad, right?

850
00:38:43,360 --> 00:38:44,720
We're trying to get daddy on board.

851
00:38:44,720 --> 00:38:46,600
To get daddy on board, you can say,

852
00:38:46,600 --> 00:38:47,720
yeah, it's a big fish tank,

853
00:38:47,720 --> 00:38:50,440
but we keep fresh seafood in there.

854
00:38:50,440 --> 00:38:53,880
And then you, every day, can be like, that one.

855
00:38:53,880 --> 00:38:55,240
Every day. That one.

856
00:38:55,240 --> 00:38:56,720
Every day. I'll eat this one.

857
00:38:56,720 --> 00:38:59,080
Also, think of how versatile it is.

858
00:38:59,080 --> 00:39:01,440
Yes, yes, you can put fish in it, of course.

859
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:03,960
Yes, you could also perhaps put a reptile in there,

860
00:39:03,960 --> 00:39:05,440
maybe even an amphibian,

861
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:08,640
but you could also store your clothes in it.

862
00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:10,680
You could keep all your loose change in it.

863
00:39:10,680 --> 00:39:13,240
You could just buy a whole bunch of boxes of cereal

864
00:39:13,240 --> 00:39:14,840
and dump it all in there with milk

865
00:39:14,840 --> 00:39:17,960
and have it be like a big cereal trough for a party.

866
00:39:17,960 --> 00:39:19,400
Oh, that's cool.

867
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:22,160
You could fill it up with mustard and a single flag

868
00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:24,560
and let Double Dare kids rummage around in there.

869
00:39:24,560 --> 00:39:25,720
Yes, yeah.

870
00:39:25,720 --> 00:39:27,080
There's so many things.

871
00:39:27,080 --> 00:39:29,680
Like, think about, tell your dad this.

872
00:39:29,680 --> 00:39:32,440
Say, dad, think about all the stupid shit you've bought

873
00:39:32,440 --> 00:39:34,760
that only does one thing and it was really expensive.

874
00:39:34,760 --> 00:39:36,000
You dumb asshole.

875
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:37,920
You dumb piece of shit.

876
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:40,800
Like you're a pacemaker.

877
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:41,880
Right.

878
00:39:41,880 --> 00:39:43,800
And what do you even do with it?

879
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:44,640
You know?

880
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:46,280
There's one thing. I can't even play with it.

881
00:39:46,280 --> 00:39:48,360
It doesn't even do Tamagotchis.

882
00:39:48,360 --> 00:39:51,600
But I could fill this fish tank with Tamagotchis, dad.

883
00:39:51,600 --> 00:39:54,080
Just try to stop me. Think about that, dad.

884
00:39:54,080 --> 00:39:56,360
I could sleep in this fish tank.

885
00:39:56,360 --> 00:39:58,160
I'm gonna sleep in my fish tank, dad.

886
00:39:58,160 --> 00:40:00,440
This is, you're not just buying me a fish tank.

887
00:40:00,440 --> 00:40:01,840
You're buying me a new bed.

888
00:40:02,720 --> 00:40:04,560
Come on, dad, grow up.

889
00:40:04,560 --> 00:40:06,560
Get a fish tank, finally.

890
00:40:06,560 --> 00:40:09,520
I think climbing inside the aquarium

891
00:40:09,520 --> 00:40:12,720
and refusing to come out is one way to make your dad buy it.

892
00:40:12,720 --> 00:40:16,360
That's a good way to make your dad buy anything.

893
00:40:16,360 --> 00:40:18,000
You go in the aquarium store,

894
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:19,360
and you're like, I want this one.

895
00:40:19,360 --> 00:40:22,680
And he says, that is 175 too many gallons.

896
00:40:22,680 --> 00:40:24,480
And then you say, oh, okay.

897
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:25,480
And you climb inside.

898
00:40:25,480 --> 00:40:27,560
And then you say, checkmate.

899
00:40:27,560 --> 00:40:29,720
Because he's gotta buy it.

900
00:40:29,720 --> 00:40:30,560
You're in it.

901
00:40:30,560 --> 00:40:31,400
No, he's gotta buy it.

902
00:40:31,400 --> 00:40:32,520
His son's in it.

903
00:40:32,520 --> 00:40:33,680
He can't just leave you there.

904
00:40:33,680 --> 00:40:35,560
That's against the rules.

905
00:40:35,560 --> 00:40:36,600
Now it is important.

906
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:38,040
You can never get out of it.

907
00:40:38,040 --> 00:40:40,360
Cause when you do, he'll immediately return it.

908
00:40:40,360 --> 00:40:41,200
No, he won't.

909
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:42,920
It's 175 fucking gallon fish tank.

910
00:40:42,920 --> 00:40:45,600
Like he's gonna wanna get that outside of his house again.

911
00:40:45,600 --> 00:40:46,760
It's gonna be tough enough to do it

912
00:40:46,760 --> 00:40:49,800
with a big boy inside of it.

913
00:40:49,800 --> 00:40:52,160
Okay, well then let's say you can't get out of it

914
00:40:52,160 --> 00:40:53,880
until he's gotten it home.

915
00:40:53,880 --> 00:40:54,960
Yeah.

916
00:40:54,960 --> 00:40:57,080
Can you find a mattress that would fit it?

917
00:40:57,080 --> 00:40:57,920
Probably.

918
00:40:57,920 --> 00:41:01,460
Cause then it would be like kind of a fun bed,

919
00:41:01,460 --> 00:41:03,080
novelty bed.

920
00:41:03,080 --> 00:41:04,400
And you could just at night,

921
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:06,700
at every night you take the water out.

922
00:41:07,800 --> 00:41:08,800
That's a bad idea.

923
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:09,640
No, no, no, keep going.

924
00:41:09,640 --> 00:41:11,800
Now that I'm running through all the p's and q's.

925
00:41:11,800 --> 00:41:13,880
No, you just dump all the water out,

926
00:41:13,880 --> 00:41:15,640
put the fish in a jug.

927
00:41:15,640 --> 00:41:17,420
You put your mattress in there.

928
00:41:17,420 --> 00:41:18,960
You sleep in there.

929
00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:20,260
That's space saving.

930
00:41:20,260 --> 00:41:21,660
It's a value.

931
00:41:21,660 --> 00:41:23,480
It's not a good idea.

932
00:41:23,480 --> 00:41:26,520
You could get this and say,

933
00:41:26,520 --> 00:41:28,860
daddy, let's just put one little fish in it.

934
00:41:29,720 --> 00:41:32,800
And think of what a great treat that will be for him.

935
00:41:33,760 --> 00:41:35,120
Daddy, I wanna get this big one

936
00:41:35,120 --> 00:41:36,760
so we can put one fish inside

937
00:41:36,760 --> 00:41:38,920
and that fish is gonna be so lucky.

938
00:41:38,920 --> 00:41:41,880
And then we owe it to the earth to do that for,

939
00:41:41,880 --> 00:41:43,840
it's all, you can't save the world by yourself,

940
00:41:43,840 --> 00:41:46,120
but you can make the, you know, a good situation

941
00:41:46,120 --> 00:41:47,580
for just one fish.

942
00:41:48,440 --> 00:41:49,280
That's pretty good.

943
00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:50,280
I like that.

944
00:41:50,280 --> 00:41:53,040
Alternatively, you could open up a fish fighting ring

945
00:41:53,040 --> 00:41:54,380
in your house and say, daddy,

946
00:41:54,380 --> 00:41:57,080
we'll get 10% of the pot every time, so.

947
00:41:57,080 --> 00:41:57,920
Okay.

948
00:41:57,920 --> 00:41:59,120
Now you think about it.

949
00:41:59,120 --> 00:42:00,720
Your dad says he wants to,

950
00:42:00,720 --> 00:42:02,760
he won't get you a 175 gallon tank.

951
00:42:02,760 --> 00:42:04,880
Okay, dad, you win this one.

952
00:42:04,880 --> 00:42:06,360
Will you get me a 10 gallon tank?

953
00:42:06,360 --> 00:42:07,280
Oh, yeah, of course.

954
00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:08,760
It's no problem.

955
00:42:08,760 --> 00:42:10,760
And then a few weeks later,

956
00:42:10,760 --> 00:42:11,880
just say like, hey, dad,

957
00:42:11,880 --> 00:42:14,940
I need a 10 gallon fish tank.

958
00:42:14,940 --> 00:42:17,400
That's still really, you said it was fine, right?

959
00:42:17,400 --> 00:42:18,240
That's fine?

960
00:42:18,240 --> 00:42:19,720
And your dad's like, yeah, it's fine, go ahead.

961
00:42:19,720 --> 00:42:23,000
Repeat 17 and a half times.

962
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:24,980
Then all of a sudden you've got 10,

963
00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:30,680
no, wait, you've got 17 and a half 10 gallon fish tanks

964
00:42:30,680 --> 00:42:32,640
and your dad feels like an asshole

965
00:42:32,640 --> 00:42:35,420
because he's paying for all these like pumps

966
00:42:35,420 --> 00:42:37,440
and decorations and things.

967
00:42:37,440 --> 00:42:39,180
He could save a lot of dough

968
00:42:39,180 --> 00:42:41,040
just doing it the right way the first time.

969
00:42:41,040 --> 00:42:43,520
If you do the job the right way the first time.

970
00:42:43,520 --> 00:42:45,480
And he's had to take you to the hospital a few times

971
00:42:45,480 --> 00:42:46,760
because of how you've tried to smash

972
00:42:46,760 --> 00:42:50,280
all these fish tanks together to make one big fish tank.

973
00:42:50,280 --> 00:42:52,120
And there's been cuts.

974
00:42:52,120 --> 00:42:53,480
Your dad feels like the jerk.

975
00:42:53,480 --> 00:42:56,060
Who's someone your dad respects

976
00:42:56,060 --> 00:42:58,840
absolutely, entirely, completely?

977
00:42:58,840 --> 00:42:59,680
Mr. Bean.

978
00:42:59,680 --> 00:43:00,520
Mr. Bean.

979
00:43:00,520 --> 00:43:01,340
You say-

980
00:43:01,340 --> 00:43:02,520
Oh, wait, were you talking about my dad?

981
00:43:02,520 --> 00:43:03,360
Yeah, okay.

982
00:43:03,360 --> 00:43:04,180
This guy's dad.

983
00:43:04,180 --> 00:43:05,020
My dad.

984
00:43:05,020 --> 00:43:06,200
If your dad is our dad,

985
00:43:06,200 --> 00:43:09,920
then you go to the aquarium store with your dad

986
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:13,320
and you just kind of almost say like offhandedly,

987
00:43:13,320 --> 00:43:17,160
like, oh yeah, I heard Mr. Bean talking about

988
00:43:17,160 --> 00:43:18,600
on entertainment tonight

989
00:43:18,600 --> 00:43:20,280
that if you're going to get a fish tank,

990
00:43:20,280 --> 00:43:21,800
the only fish tank you want to get

991
00:43:21,800 --> 00:43:23,480
is a 175 gallon fish tank.

992
00:43:23,480 --> 00:43:25,800
Yeah, my dad, yeah, you know, dad,

993
00:43:25,800 --> 00:43:28,440
I heard this is the kind of tank that Travis Tritt owns.

994
00:43:28,440 --> 00:43:29,480
There you go.

995
00:43:29,480 --> 00:43:30,320
There it is.

996
00:43:30,320 --> 00:43:31,800
Travis Tritt owns this exact model.

997
00:43:31,800 --> 00:43:32,880
Fuck it, all right, fuck it, man.

998
00:43:32,880 --> 00:43:36,200
Get Travis Tritt to just like walk by you, behind you.

999
00:43:36,200 --> 00:43:38,640
Look at, that's a badass fish tank, man.

1000
00:43:38,640 --> 00:43:39,480
That's a great tank right there.

1001
00:43:39,480 --> 00:43:40,320
Yeah, that's a good tank.

1002
00:43:40,320 --> 00:43:41,440
That's the kind of tank I got.

1003
00:43:41,440 --> 00:43:43,040
That's a good tank for a great price.

1004
00:43:43,040 --> 00:43:44,160
And I want to thank you again

1005
00:43:44,160 --> 00:43:46,760
for shopping Travis Tritt's Aquariums and more.

1006
00:43:47,640 --> 00:43:49,040
Yo, come on back anytime.

1007
00:43:49,040 --> 00:43:49,880
You're welcome.

1008
00:43:49,880 --> 00:43:51,400
And nobody's going to give you a better deal than Travis.

1009
00:43:51,400 --> 00:43:52,240
That's what's on the side.

1010
00:43:52,240 --> 00:43:54,480
Hey, thanks for shopping at Tritt and quit it.

1011
00:43:54,480 --> 00:43:55,600
He's done.

1012
00:43:55,600 --> 00:43:57,960
Grab yourself a fish tank and then get on out.

1013
00:43:57,960 --> 00:43:58,920
I've Tritt tanks.

1014
00:43:58,920 --> 00:44:01,600
I'd fill that shit up with mustard, I would.

1015
00:44:01,600 --> 00:44:02,440
I often do.

1016
00:44:02,440 --> 00:44:04,420
And let some kids double down around in there.

1017
00:44:04,420 --> 00:44:05,260
Double dare did him.

1018
00:44:05,260 --> 00:44:06,520
It's always a great day to be alive here

1019
00:44:06,520 --> 00:44:09,000
at Travis Tritt's Aquariums and stuff.

1020
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:11,040
Okay, anyways, please move on.

1021
00:44:11,040 --> 00:44:13,040
Travis Tritt's Fish and Shits.

1022
00:44:13,040 --> 00:44:18,040
Hey folks, this is Travis Tritt for Travis Tritt's

1023
00:44:21,540 --> 00:44:22,380
Fish and Shits.

1024
00:44:22,380 --> 00:44:24,880
I just want to remind you that we are working every day

1025
00:44:24,880 --> 00:44:26,960
to obtain the license that we need to sell fish

1026
00:44:26,960 --> 00:44:29,040
directly to you, the consumer.

1027
00:44:29,040 --> 00:44:30,720
We're just weeks to months away.

1028
00:44:30,720 --> 00:44:33,640
Our lawyers assure us from getting those special permits

1029
00:44:33,640 --> 00:44:35,940
that will allow us to sell the finest quality fish

1030
00:44:35,940 --> 00:44:37,320
at the finest quality prices.

1031
00:44:37,320 --> 00:44:39,880
And please, please do not confuse this location

1032
00:44:39,880 --> 00:44:42,020
with Travis Tritt's Fish and Chips.

1033
00:44:42,020 --> 00:44:44,320
That is across town.

1034
00:44:44,320 --> 00:44:48,020
Both are mine and both were poorly planned.

1035
00:44:48,020 --> 00:44:48,860
Thank you.

1036
00:44:48,860 --> 00:44:49,680
Now weirdly-

1037
00:44:49,680 --> 00:44:51,840
I work at one during the morning and one during the night

1038
00:44:51,840 --> 00:44:54,040
and I won't answer any more questions about that.

1039
00:44:54,040 --> 00:44:54,880
Thank you.

1040
00:44:56,240 --> 00:44:58,480
That's getting personal, folks.

1041
00:44:58,480 --> 00:45:01,400
And yes, I still find time to make music.

1042
00:45:01,400 --> 00:45:03,680
Don't be an asshole about it.

1043
00:45:03,680 --> 00:45:05,300
And I balance work and family.

1044
00:45:05,300 --> 00:45:07,580
Okay, can we please move on?

1045
00:45:07,580 --> 00:45:11,820
Ask me about my love of fish, both retail and dining.

1046
00:45:11,820 --> 00:45:13,360
Everyone wants to know about the fish.

1047
00:45:13,360 --> 00:45:15,720
Nobody asked me about the and shits.

1048
00:45:18,320 --> 00:45:19,140
That's fine.

1049
00:45:19,140 --> 00:45:21,000
I got CD players in here too, but that's fine.

1050
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:23,760
I guess you just want to talk about this.

1051
00:45:23,760 --> 00:45:26,040
Got back some Gatorade brand gum.

1052
00:45:26,040 --> 00:45:28,640
It's been inspired for five years.

1053
00:45:28,640 --> 00:45:29,480
Nobody asked me about it.

1054
00:45:29,480 --> 00:45:33,000
Yeah, let's talk about these fucking stupid fish, I guess.

1055
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:35,440
Tim Conway passed.

1056
00:45:35,440 --> 00:45:37,520
I would love to talk about this complete set

1057
00:45:37,520 --> 00:45:39,520
of Dorphe and Jeff's tapes that I got,

1058
00:45:39,520 --> 00:45:40,360
but I can't sell them.

1059
00:45:40,360 --> 00:45:41,200
I guess I can't.

1060
00:45:41,200 --> 00:45:42,120
I guess I can't.

1061
00:45:42,120 --> 00:45:43,560
Everybody wants to talk about the fish

1062
00:45:43,560 --> 00:45:44,960
that I can't legally sell.

1063
00:45:44,960 --> 00:45:46,980
God's wettest and worst animal.

1064
00:45:48,360 --> 00:45:49,200
God, I hate fish.

1065
00:45:50,700 --> 00:45:52,200
What have I done?

1066
00:45:52,200 --> 00:45:53,040
What have I done?

1067
00:45:53,040 --> 00:45:55,560
I should have thought this through.

1068
00:45:55,560 --> 00:45:57,480
How about one last question?

1069
00:45:57,480 --> 00:46:00,220
Recently, a friend and I popped into a liquor store

1070
00:46:00,220 --> 00:46:03,400
on our way to do some thrift shopping.

1071
00:46:03,400 --> 00:46:07,800
Once inside, we noticed that they had a wine tasting label,

1072
00:46:07,800 --> 00:46:10,680
sorry, table, and we decided to spend a few extra minutes

1073
00:46:10,680 --> 00:46:12,640
tasting some vine.

1074
00:46:12,640 --> 00:46:15,160
That's when we noticed the number seven on the table

1075
00:46:15,160 --> 00:46:17,520
and looked around to see at least six other

1076
00:46:17,520 --> 00:46:20,600
wine tasting tables scattered around the store.

1077
00:46:20,600 --> 00:46:24,800
Y'all, each table had six wines available to sample

1078
00:46:24,800 --> 00:46:26,960
and everything else is free.

1079
00:46:26,960 --> 00:46:30,080
My question is, what is the appropriate etiquette here?

1080
00:46:30,080 --> 00:46:33,640
What, are we supposed to drink 42 wine samples?

1081
00:46:33,640 --> 00:46:35,600
Or is there a more strategic and classy way

1082
00:46:35,600 --> 00:46:37,080
to handle this offering?

1083
00:46:37,080 --> 00:46:40,240
That's for more loads of options.

1084
00:46:40,240 --> 00:46:42,280
What would you do, Griffin?

1085
00:46:42,280 --> 00:46:43,720
What I would do?

1086
00:46:43,720 --> 00:46:45,360
Yeah.

1087
00:46:45,360 --> 00:46:49,680
I would go around, I would smell all 42 of these little cups

1088
00:46:49,680 --> 00:46:51,920
and I mean, huff them deep.

1089
00:46:51,920 --> 00:46:55,360
And on the 42nd one, I accidentally snort some up my nose

1090
00:46:55,360 --> 00:46:57,200
and I would start coughing and have to leave

1091
00:46:57,200 --> 00:46:58,980
because I got embarrassed.

1092
00:46:58,980 --> 00:47:00,160
Okay, that's what Griffin would do.

1093
00:47:00,160 --> 00:47:01,480
Justin, what would you do?

1094
00:47:01,480 --> 00:47:03,720
Let me say, let me say, that's not what I wanna do.

1095
00:47:03,720 --> 00:47:05,020
That's just what would happen.

1096
00:47:05,020 --> 00:47:06,360
That's just what happened.

1097
00:47:07,320 --> 00:47:11,480
If I went, I would want to drink all of them

1098
00:47:11,480 --> 00:47:13,820
because they were there, but then I would assume

1099
00:47:13,820 --> 00:47:15,720
that I'd pick the first one up and another,

1100
00:47:15,720 --> 00:47:17,800
like maybe a human being who worked there

1101
00:47:17,800 --> 00:47:20,560
or a human being who knew the process better than me

1102
00:47:20,560 --> 00:47:24,040
would say out loud, that's not what you're supposed to do

1103
00:47:24,040 --> 00:47:26,000
and I would melt into the floor.

1104
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:28,160
Yeah, like Alex Mack, sure.

1105
00:47:28,160 --> 00:47:30,760
Right, right.

1106
00:47:30,760 --> 00:47:32,040
You know, I love one.

1107
00:47:33,220 --> 00:47:37,000
I think maybe just pick one of the different varietals

1108
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:40,320
that you wanna try, like just the cabs

1109
00:47:40,320 --> 00:47:41,840
and then just sample the cabs

1110
00:47:41,840 --> 00:47:43,680
and then everyone will understand that,

1111
00:47:43,680 --> 00:47:46,320
say I'm just looking for high test cabs.

1112
00:47:46,320 --> 00:47:47,160
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1113
00:47:47,160 --> 00:47:50,020
Just your best cabs and then once you've tried them all,

1114
00:47:50,020 --> 00:47:51,960
maybe you're kinda like, hey, listen,

1115
00:47:51,960 --> 00:47:53,280
I've been thinking a lot about it

1116
00:47:53,280 --> 00:47:56,840
and I think I'm more of a short name man now.

1117
00:47:56,840 --> 00:48:00,200
So I would like to try your shards, see how they're doing.

1118
00:48:00,200 --> 00:48:03,540
And then you can just go brand by brand, varietal by varietal.

1119
00:48:03,540 --> 00:48:04,720
That's cool, yeah.

1120
00:48:04,720 --> 00:48:07,680
And then you can step outside and shit your pants

1121
00:48:07,680 --> 00:48:11,540
and I don't know that we should necessarily endorse

1122
00:48:11,540 --> 00:48:13,040
that course of action.

1123
00:48:13,040 --> 00:48:15,880
No, I don't think binge drinking is a good,

1124
00:48:15,880 --> 00:48:19,760
do you see anything that's vaguely bucket shaped?

1125
00:48:19,760 --> 00:48:21,320
Is there anything that looks like a bucket?

1126
00:48:21,320 --> 00:48:24,400
Because that's supposed to be spit in that.

1127
00:48:24,400 --> 00:48:25,240
Yeah.

1128
00:48:25,240 --> 00:48:26,080
It's supposed to be spit in that.

1129
00:48:26,080 --> 00:48:28,000
You're not supposed to be getting a day drunk

1130
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:30,200
going to the liquor store, I'm pretty sure.

1131
00:48:30,200 --> 00:48:31,400
I think you're supposed to,

1132
00:48:31,400 --> 00:48:33,020
if you don't drink the right one,

1133
00:48:33,020 --> 00:48:35,760
you turn old and turn into ash and bones and stuff.

1134
00:48:35,760 --> 00:48:37,400
Yes, that's probably true.

1135
00:48:37,400 --> 00:48:39,220
So that's important.

1136
00:48:39,220 --> 00:48:42,800
You're gonna have to mix four of them to solve a riddle.

1137
00:48:42,800 --> 00:48:43,640
Like feel like-

1138
00:48:43,640 --> 00:48:44,460
Yeah, you're trying to,

1139
00:48:44,460 --> 00:48:45,560
you got a five gallon jug and a three gallon jug.

1140
00:48:45,560 --> 00:48:47,680
Right, yes, yes, yes, yes.

1141
00:48:47,680 --> 00:48:49,860
And a 175 gallon fish tank.

1142
00:48:51,560 --> 00:48:53,060
I mean, I would just go to the back of the store,

1143
00:48:53,060 --> 00:48:55,360
grab a sixer or a bud and say like,

1144
00:48:55,360 --> 00:48:57,400
this is my wine.

1145
00:48:57,400 --> 00:49:00,840
And then I'd walk out of the store without paying.

1146
00:49:00,840 --> 00:49:03,960
I think maybe if I owned this liquor store,

1147
00:49:03,960 --> 00:49:07,040
I would set this up with like 42 free samples of wine.

1148
00:49:07,040 --> 00:49:08,980
And when someone walked through, I'd be like,

1149
00:49:08,980 --> 00:49:10,800
yes, it's all free.

1150
00:49:10,800 --> 00:49:12,560
And it's 42 samples of wine.

1151
00:49:12,560 --> 00:49:15,120
One of the 42 is poisoned.

1152
00:49:15,120 --> 00:49:16,960
Oh, that's a bad idea.

1153
00:49:16,960 --> 00:49:19,520
Okay, but then statistically, if you want-

1154
00:49:19,520 --> 00:49:20,680
Less than nothing, that one.

1155
00:49:20,680 --> 00:49:22,560
If you want a bunch of free wine,

1156
00:49:23,480 --> 00:49:25,280
cool, listen, that's fine.

1157
00:49:25,280 --> 00:49:27,600
But you have to ask me about each one

1158
00:49:27,600 --> 00:49:29,080
before you drink it.

1159
00:49:29,080 --> 00:49:31,700
Oh, oh, okay.

1160
00:49:31,700 --> 00:49:34,840
So if you don't ask about the one that's poison,

1161
00:49:34,840 --> 00:49:35,840
then you're the asshole.

1162
00:49:35,840 --> 00:49:37,380
They'll tell you, right.

1163
00:49:37,380 --> 00:49:39,260
You could test all of them and be like,

1164
00:49:39,260 --> 00:49:41,960
okay, I've found my favorite one.

1165
00:49:41,960 --> 00:49:44,120
And then fucking like Ellen comes out

1166
00:49:44,120 --> 00:49:46,840
and she's like, this is a big social prank.

1167
00:49:46,840 --> 00:49:48,300
They're all the same wine.

1168
00:49:48,300 --> 00:49:52,760
And this is proof about how fucking fake America is.

1169
00:49:52,760 --> 00:49:55,840
And then you're like, Ellen, your brand has changed

1170
00:49:55,840 --> 00:49:56,880
a little bit.

1171
00:49:56,880 --> 00:49:58,760
Maybe Griffin should have thought of somebody else to,

1172
00:49:58,760 --> 00:50:01,840
and she's like, I know it's strange for me to put America

1173
00:50:01,840 --> 00:50:04,400
and sort of their habits and beliefs on blast,

1174
00:50:04,400 --> 00:50:07,560
but everybody's got their noses in their phones all the time

1175
00:50:07,560 --> 00:50:10,040
and everybody's taking pictures of their food on Instagram

1176
00:50:10,040 --> 00:50:11,400
and all this wine is the same.

1177
00:50:11,400 --> 00:50:14,040
So now you're a dumb idiot and-

1178
00:50:14,040 --> 00:50:15,620
And I'm gonna dance.

1179
00:50:15,620 --> 00:50:17,240
I'm going to dance on out of the store

1180
00:50:17,240 --> 00:50:18,120
and you have to watch me.

1181
00:50:18,120 --> 00:50:21,520
I'm gonna dance and pray for the destruction of America,

1182
00:50:21,520 --> 00:50:24,040
which is a garbage country that I hate now.

1183
00:50:24,040 --> 00:50:25,360
Thank you for me, Ellen.

1184
00:50:27,080 --> 00:50:28,720
I'm gonna pray for your downfall.

1185
00:50:30,560 --> 00:50:33,040
Your gods have become dust under me, Ellen.

1186
00:50:33,040 --> 00:50:35,120
Also, Jennifer Lawrence is in this box.

1187
00:50:35,120 --> 00:50:38,280
She's gonna jump out and scare you, but why even bother?

1188
00:50:38,280 --> 00:50:39,800
Why even fucking bother?

1189
00:50:39,800 --> 00:50:40,800
Stay in there, Jennifer.

1190
00:50:40,800 --> 00:50:42,160
America was a mistake.

1191
00:50:42,160 --> 00:50:43,200
I'm Ellen DeGeneres.

1192
00:50:43,200 --> 00:50:44,200
It's time to dance.

1193
00:50:46,200 --> 00:50:47,840
Happy Independence Day, everybody.

1194
00:50:47,840 --> 00:50:48,680
This is-

1195
00:50:48,680 --> 00:50:51,960
The worm-filled carcass of liberty

1196
00:50:53,760 --> 00:50:56,360
is my next guest and your guest

1197
00:50:56,360 --> 00:50:58,320
for your and your grandchildren's lives.

1198
00:50:58,320 --> 00:51:00,920
Anyways, here's a kid who can yodel or whatever the fuck.

1199
00:51:00,920 --> 00:51:02,480
Here's a kid who can yodel

1200
00:51:02,480 --> 00:51:04,840
about the downfall of imperialism.

1225
00:52:01,560 --> 00:52:03,360
No, no, no, the audience was great.

1226
00:52:03,360 --> 00:52:06,000
We were mediocre, but the audience was great.

1227
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:07,480
