1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,820
The McElroy brothers are not experts and their advice should never be followed

2
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:10,580
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it

3
00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:17,660
Also, this show isn't for kids which I mentioned only so the babies out there will know how cool they are for listening

4
00:00:17,660 --> 00:00:30,660
What's up, you cool, baby?

5
00:00:48,440 --> 00:00:50,440
It's better, it's better with you

6
00:00:53,980 --> 00:00:56,060
It's better it's better with you

7
00:00:56,060 --> 00:01:21,060
Hello everybody and welcome to my brother, my brother, and me, an advice show for the modern era. I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy.

8
00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:25,060
Oh no. No, no, no, no, no. I'm Travis, the middle-est.

9
00:01:25,060 --> 00:01:27,060
No, I like it.

10
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:31,060
I like the energy, except for the spin on the name.

11
00:01:31,060 --> 00:01:33,060
Oh, nope.

12
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:35,060
Oh, that's good stuff.

13
00:01:35,060 --> 00:01:37,060
It's something new, Travis. We're in the 600s now.

14
00:01:37,060 --> 00:01:39,060
I was standing at the sexy sixes.

15
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:41,060
Oh, the sex hundreds.

16
00:01:41,060 --> 00:01:43,060
The sex hundreds.

17
00:01:43,060 --> 00:01:45,060
The sex hundreds.

18
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:49,060
We're like 66 episodes away from another episode that we're going to have to skip.

19
00:01:49,060 --> 00:01:51,060
There's no way.

20
00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:53,060
We would get in so much trouble.

21
00:01:53,060 --> 00:01:55,060
We would get in so much trouble with my dad for doing the devil's eyes.

22
00:01:55,060 --> 00:01:57,060
I'm not going to summon El Diablo.

23
00:01:57,060 --> 00:01:59,060
No, thank you.

24
00:01:59,060 --> 00:02:01,060
No, thank you.

25
00:02:01,060 --> 00:02:09,060
We're already tempting fate enough playing Dungeons and Dragons to then mess with that black magic.

26
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:11,060
Oh my God.

27
00:02:11,060 --> 00:02:15,060
This is like when my D&D character died all over again, just like that Chick track.

28
00:02:15,060 --> 00:02:25,060
If you were to make a biopic of Gary Gygax, do you think you would put in a scene where he's looking at a piece of paper and it says Dungeons or Dragons?

29
00:02:25,060 --> 00:02:29,060
And he's looking at it and he's like, well, hold on a second.

30
00:02:29,060 --> 00:02:31,060
Then he just erases it.

31
00:02:31,060 --> 00:02:33,060
And he showed it.

32
00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:37,060
Should I make a game about Dungeons, question mark?

33
00:02:37,060 --> 00:02:39,060
Dragons, question mark?

34
00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:43,060
And then there was a character like Justin Timberlake in social.

35
00:02:43,060 --> 00:02:45,060
Dungeons ain't cool.

36
00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:47,060
You know what's cool?

37
00:02:47,060 --> 00:02:49,060
Dungeons and Dragons.

38
00:02:49,060 --> 00:02:53,060
But then the haters are like, how are you going to fit a dragon inside of a dungeon, Gary?

39
00:02:53,060 --> 00:02:55,060
It's too small.

40
00:02:55,060 --> 00:02:57,060
It's a small chamber, Gary.

41
00:02:57,060 --> 00:03:03,060
What I'm saying is that I'm going to put the dungeon inside the dragon.

42
00:03:03,060 --> 00:03:05,060
Well, I don't think that's it either, Gary.

43
00:03:05,060 --> 00:03:09,060
And that's my vision for Elden Ring too.

44
00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:11,060
The dungeon's inside the dragon.

45
00:03:11,060 --> 00:03:13,060
Yeah, that's good stuff.

46
00:03:13,060 --> 00:03:15,060
This is an advice show.

47
00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:19,060
I'm standing. I wanted to bring standing energy to this episode.

48
00:03:19,060 --> 00:03:25,060
Sometimes I dig deep, deep down and I stand up.

49
00:03:25,060 --> 00:03:29,060
You summon everything within you.

50
00:03:29,060 --> 00:03:31,060
I channel all my strength and I stand.

51
00:03:31,060 --> 00:03:33,060
I used to do this for hours at Best Buy.

52
00:03:33,060 --> 00:03:37,060
I should be able to do it for an hour while we record this podcast, right?

53
00:03:37,060 --> 00:03:39,060
I'm at work.

54
00:03:39,060 --> 00:03:45,060
I still have the same springy, dewy body that you had in your Best Buy days.

55
00:03:45,060 --> 00:03:47,060
Yeah, that's true. I was fucking so sexy.

56
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:49,060
I was ripped.

57
00:03:49,060 --> 00:03:51,060
That blue polo.

58
00:03:51,060 --> 00:03:55,060
I was thinking about this this morning, speaking of dewy, sexy bodies.

59
00:03:55,060 --> 00:03:59,060
What do you guys think you're the Ryan Reynolds of?

60
00:03:59,060 --> 00:04:03,060
Because I saw Ryan Reynolds and clearly he's the Ryan Reynolds of movies, right?

61
00:04:03,060 --> 00:04:05,060
Well, and selling cell phones.

62
00:04:05,060 --> 00:04:07,060
Yeah, and owning soccer teams, I believe.

63
00:04:07,060 --> 00:04:09,060
Did he need to sell the cell phones?

64
00:04:09,060 --> 00:04:11,060
No, that's a passion. That's a passion project.

65
00:04:11,060 --> 00:04:15,060
He just loves getting burners in the hands of miscreants.

66
00:04:15,060 --> 00:04:21,060
The gym, the soccer team, the movies, that's his day job, right?

67
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:25,060
Selling cell phones, that's his passion.

68
00:04:25,060 --> 00:04:27,060
One for him, one for me.

69
00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:29,060
Yeah, he's the Ryan Reynolds of selling cell phones.

70
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:31,060
The Lord came to him in a dream and said,

71
00:04:31,060 --> 00:04:37,060
Ryan, you must sell cell phones that when people drop them in the toilet, they go, eh, oh well.

72
00:04:37,060 --> 00:04:39,060
I'll get another one.

73
00:04:39,060 --> 00:04:41,060
That's fine.

74
00:04:41,060 --> 00:04:43,060
What am I the Ryan Reynolds of?

75
00:04:43,060 --> 00:04:45,060
Yeah.

76
00:04:45,060 --> 00:04:47,060
I mean, is this about physical appearance?

77
00:04:47,060 --> 00:04:49,060
No, no, no.

78
00:04:49,060 --> 00:04:53,060
If you were saying, well, you know, like Ryan Reynolds from movies?

79
00:04:53,060 --> 00:04:55,060
Well, I'm like the Ryan Reynolds of blank.

80
00:04:55,060 --> 00:04:57,060
You know what I mean?

81
00:04:57,060 --> 00:04:59,060
Can I say movies?

82
00:04:59,060 --> 00:05:01,060
Ryan Reynolds of movies.

83
00:05:01,060 --> 00:05:03,060
Well, I guess if he's going to take Ryan Reynolds of cell phones,

84
00:05:03,060 --> 00:05:05,060
you could be the Ryan Reynolds of movies.

85
00:05:05,060 --> 00:05:07,060
He shouldn't be allowed to take all that stuff.

86
00:05:07,060 --> 00:05:09,060
You, as we realized this week, or as I realized this week,

87
00:05:09,060 --> 00:05:13,060
you did perform in an Oscar-nominated film.

88
00:05:13,060 --> 00:05:15,060
Right.

89
00:05:15,060 --> 00:05:21,060
You're basically an Oscar-nominated film performer for your hidden cameo.

90
00:05:21,060 --> 00:05:23,060
That's true.

91
00:05:23,060 --> 00:05:25,060
It's not really hidden. I mean, I am in the credits of the film.

92
00:05:25,060 --> 00:05:29,060
No, if you want to say hidden, Justin and I have a hidden cameo

93
00:05:29,060 --> 00:05:31,060
where robots took our jobs.

94
00:05:31,060 --> 00:05:37,060
Ironically, in the movie Mitchell's vs. the Machines,

95
00:05:37,060 --> 00:05:39,060
robots took our jobs.

96
00:05:39,060 --> 00:05:41,060
And you know I'm rooting for him in cancer.

97
00:05:41,060 --> 00:05:43,060
You know I want Lenny to get that EGOT.

98
00:05:43,060 --> 00:05:45,060
Obviously.

99
00:05:45,060 --> 00:05:47,060
That would be so huge for him, because you know he's just like,

100
00:05:47,060 --> 00:05:49,060
he's tortured until he gets that O.

101
00:05:49,060 --> 00:05:53,060
But me, like, I could just have an awe.

102
00:05:53,060 --> 00:05:55,060
You know what I mean?

103
00:05:55,060 --> 00:05:57,060
If Mitchell's vs. the Machines wins the Oscar for best animated picture,

104
00:05:57,060 --> 00:05:59,060
I think they do have to send me one,

105
00:05:59,060 --> 00:06:01,060
because I did do a voice in it.

106
00:06:01,060 --> 00:06:03,060
Who knows, that could have been the linchpin

107
00:06:03,060 --> 00:06:05,060
keeping the whole thing together.

108
00:06:05,060 --> 00:06:09,060
They should give out Oscars sized to the contribution.

109
00:06:09,060 --> 00:06:11,060
So Griffin would get a little teeny tiny one,

110
00:06:11,060 --> 00:06:13,060
because he had an off-screen cameo.

111
00:06:13,060 --> 00:06:15,060
Like an earring.

112
00:06:15,060 --> 00:06:17,060
Wow, okay.

113
00:06:17,060 --> 00:06:19,060
I don't know why you had to tear me down for that.

114
00:06:19,060 --> 00:06:21,060
Because we got cut because of robots.

115
00:06:21,060 --> 00:06:23,060
Because robots took our jobs.

116
00:06:23,060 --> 00:06:25,060
It's weird that robot didn't take my job though.

117
00:06:25,060 --> 00:06:27,060
Did we tell that story?

118
00:06:27,060 --> 00:06:29,060
We can probably tell that story now.

119
00:06:29,060 --> 00:06:31,060
Let's preface it by saying,

120
00:06:31,060 --> 00:06:33,060
there is no animosity from us whatsoever.

121
00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:35,060
It sounds like there's a little bit.

122
00:06:35,060 --> 00:06:37,060
It's just such a fucking funny,

123
00:06:37,060 --> 00:06:39,060
no it is towards you,

124
00:06:39,060 --> 00:06:41,060
but so we recorded some voices for Mitchell's vs. the Machines.

125
00:06:41,060 --> 00:06:43,060
This is something that happens, you know,

126
00:06:43,060 --> 00:06:45,060
especially with voiceover stuff.

127
00:06:45,060 --> 00:06:47,060
You don't know if you're actually going to be like,

128
00:06:47,060 --> 00:06:49,060
in it until,

129
00:06:49,060 --> 00:06:51,060
they just swap you out with stuff.

130
00:06:51,060 --> 00:06:53,060
So they wanted us to do voices for these appliances.

131
00:06:53,060 --> 00:06:55,060
And the initial thing that they had wanted to do,

132
00:06:55,060 --> 00:06:59,060
was have like computer generated voices.

133
00:06:59,060 --> 00:07:01,060
That was like AI or whatever,

134
00:07:01,060 --> 00:07:03,060
but I guess the voice technology was trademarked or whatever.

135
00:07:03,060 --> 00:07:05,060
So those were the parts that we were going to do.

136
00:07:05,060 --> 00:07:11,060
And then they managed to clear the AI voices.

137
00:07:11,060 --> 00:07:13,060
So like the artificially generated voices,

138
00:07:13,060 --> 00:07:15,060
they used those quite literally.

139
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:17,060
Literally.

140
00:07:17,060 --> 00:07:23,060
We were supposed to be immune to jobs taking our machines.

141
00:07:23,060 --> 00:07:25,060
That is exactly what happened to us.

142
00:07:25,060 --> 00:07:27,060
And it's delicious because that is,

143
00:07:27,060 --> 00:07:29,060
if you've seen the film,

144
00:07:29,060 --> 00:07:31,060
pretty much the plot of the thing.

145
00:07:31,060 --> 00:07:33,060
The plot of the thing. We're living it.

146
00:07:33,060 --> 00:07:35,060
You lived it.

147
00:07:35,060 --> 00:07:37,060
McElroy's vs. the Machines.

148
00:07:37,060 --> 00:07:39,060
And the machines win.

149
00:07:39,060 --> 00:07:41,060
But Griffin.

150
00:07:41,060 --> 00:07:43,060
I will cut my Oscar into three pieces

151
00:07:43,060 --> 00:07:45,060
that we can assemble Shrine of the Silver Monkey style.

152
00:07:45,060 --> 00:07:47,060
Yes, I've seen this. This is a Solomon thing.

153
00:07:47,060 --> 00:07:49,060
No, let Griffin keep the Oscar.

154
00:07:49,060 --> 00:07:51,060
Now Griffin, I don't want to put you on the spot,

155
00:07:51,060 --> 00:07:53,060
but do you think you could recreate?

156
00:07:53,060 --> 00:07:55,060
Yeah, sure, sure.

157
00:07:55,060 --> 00:07:57,060
Could you recreate your Oscar nominated line?

158
00:07:57,060 --> 00:07:59,060
Yeah, sure, sure. Here we go.

159
00:07:59,060 --> 00:08:01,060
Today I'll be playing the voice of Freezer.

160
00:08:01,060 --> 00:08:03,060
Freeze!

161
00:08:03,060 --> 00:08:05,060
So there's...

162
00:08:05,060 --> 00:08:07,060
But you did have a line in it.

163
00:08:07,060 --> 00:08:09,060
That's pretty much it.

164
00:08:09,060 --> 00:08:11,060
That's it.

165
00:08:11,060 --> 00:08:13,060
No, you're the guy in the hallway in the dorm.

166
00:08:13,060 --> 00:08:15,060
No, I didn't get that part.

167
00:08:15,060 --> 00:08:17,060
I think you did.

168
00:08:17,060 --> 00:08:19,060
Maybe I did. Who knows?

169
00:08:19,060 --> 00:08:21,060
But all I know is that

170
00:08:21,060 --> 00:08:23,060
I am going to melt the Oscar down

171
00:08:23,060 --> 00:08:25,060
and turn it into money.

172
00:08:25,060 --> 00:08:27,060
That was very fun.

173
00:08:27,060 --> 00:08:29,060
Can I reiterate? There is zero.

174
00:08:29,060 --> 00:08:31,060
Zero anime. It's a great movie

175
00:08:31,060 --> 00:08:33,060
and we are really excited.

176
00:08:33,060 --> 00:08:35,060
Especially from me because I dig it in.

177
00:08:35,060 --> 00:08:37,060
I'm trying to be gracious about this

178
00:08:37,060 --> 00:08:39,060
and Griffin is making it so challenging.

179
00:08:39,060 --> 00:08:41,060
No, no, no. You're being gracious to them

180
00:08:41,060 --> 00:08:43,060
and I'm being super gracious to them

181
00:08:43,060 --> 00:08:45,060
because they kept me.

182
00:08:45,060 --> 00:08:47,060
This is how gracious I am.

183
00:08:47,060 --> 00:08:49,060
They sent out casting crew gifts

184
00:08:49,060 --> 00:08:51,060
and I still have one. I have it on display.

185
00:08:51,060 --> 00:08:53,060
Yeah, I didn't shatter mine with a ball peen hammer.

186
00:08:53,060 --> 00:08:55,060
Definitely.

187
00:08:55,060 --> 00:08:57,060
I have those now.

188
00:08:57,060 --> 00:08:59,060
I do.

189
00:08:59,060 --> 00:09:01,060
Can I jump back to The Wisdom of Solomon real quick?

190
00:09:01,060 --> 00:09:03,060
Just want to touch on it.

191
00:09:03,060 --> 00:09:05,060
Yes!

192
00:09:05,060 --> 00:09:07,060
That's what this country is missing.

193
00:09:07,060 --> 00:09:09,060
Let's all take it back to The Wisdom of Solomon.

194
00:09:09,060 --> 00:09:11,060
Isn't it fucked up?

195
00:09:11,060 --> 00:09:13,060
Solomon's like,

196
00:09:13,060 --> 00:09:15,060
all right, I'm going to cut this baby in half

197
00:09:15,060 --> 00:09:17,060
and then you guys can each have half.

198
00:09:17,060 --> 00:09:19,060
One of the people is like,

199
00:09:19,060 --> 00:09:21,060
sounds good to me.

200
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:23,060
Do you guys want to make a billion dollars?

201
00:09:23,060 --> 00:09:25,060
Sure.

202
00:09:25,060 --> 00:09:27,060
Listen. Fuck, this is good.

203
00:09:27,060 --> 00:09:29,060
King Solomon's like,

204
00:09:29,060 --> 00:09:31,060
guys, if you're not standing already,

205
00:09:31,060 --> 00:09:33,060
get on my level because it is invigorating.

206
00:09:33,060 --> 00:09:35,060
My mic's just not that high.

207
00:09:35,060 --> 00:09:37,060
Get higher, baby.

208
00:09:37,060 --> 00:09:39,060
I'm looking down to the microphone.

209
00:09:39,060 --> 00:09:41,060
Okay.

210
00:09:41,060 --> 00:09:43,060
King Solomon's like,

211
00:09:43,060 --> 00:09:45,060
well,

212
00:09:45,060 --> 00:09:47,060
if you all can't agree on whose baby it is,

213
00:09:47,060 --> 00:09:49,060
I guess we'll just have to cut it in half.

214
00:09:49,060 --> 00:09:51,060
Then the baby turns around

215
00:09:51,060 --> 00:09:53,060
and is like,

216
00:09:53,060 --> 00:09:55,060
you're going to want to run that by HR.

217
00:09:55,060 --> 00:09:57,060
Boss Baby 3.

218
00:09:57,060 --> 00:09:59,060
Whoa!

219
00:09:59,060 --> 00:10:01,060
Yes!

220
00:10:01,060 --> 00:10:03,060
That's so choice, right?

221
00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:05,060
Yes! Fuck yes!

222
00:10:05,060 --> 00:10:07,060
I love this.

223
00:10:07,060 --> 00:10:09,060
We can have a whole series of this

224
00:10:09,060 --> 00:10:11,060
where it's like,

225
00:10:11,060 --> 00:10:13,060
oh, Pharaoh said to kill all the male babies

226
00:10:13,060 --> 00:10:15,060
and we got to put this baby in a basket

227
00:10:15,060 --> 00:10:17,060
and float him down the river.

228
00:10:17,060 --> 00:10:19,060
The baby turns around like,

229
00:10:19,060 --> 00:10:21,060
excuse me? Boss Baby 3.

230
00:10:21,060 --> 00:10:23,060
It's all biblical.

231
00:10:23,060 --> 00:10:25,060
Listen, don't confine yourself.

232
00:10:25,060 --> 00:10:27,060
Baby's day out.

233
00:10:27,060 --> 00:10:29,060
The baby's rocking around on girders

234
00:10:29,060 --> 00:10:31,060
and there's a monkey trying to eat it.

235
00:10:31,060 --> 00:10:33,060
The baby's about to fall off the girder

236
00:10:33,060 --> 00:10:35,060
and then Boss Baby pops up and he's like,

237
00:10:35,060 --> 00:10:37,060
um,

238
00:10:37,060 --> 00:10:39,060
don't think you're going to file for Workman's comp.

239
00:10:39,060 --> 00:10:41,060
Boss Baby 3.

240
00:10:41,060 --> 00:10:43,060
Boss Baby pops up and says, hey, you're better than this.

241
00:10:43,060 --> 00:10:45,060
You don't have to be a clown for those adults out there watching you.

242
00:10:45,060 --> 00:10:47,060
I liked my bet.

243
00:10:47,060 --> 00:10:49,060
We'll workshop it.

244
00:10:49,060 --> 00:10:51,060
There's plenty of time for this Boss Baby 3 trailer.

245
00:10:51,060 --> 00:10:53,060
A lot of people like to talk about Solomon's Great Wisdom

246
00:10:53,060 --> 00:10:55,060
because he was like,

247
00:10:55,060 --> 00:10:57,060
let's cut a baby in half. JK, you win.

248
00:10:57,060 --> 00:10:59,060
Cut a baby into half.

249
00:10:59,060 --> 00:11:01,060
But I bet you he also had some

250
00:11:01,060 --> 00:11:03,060
thinkers of rulings like, oh, man,

251
00:11:03,060 --> 00:11:05,060
she did, she menstruated

252
00:11:05,060 --> 00:11:07,060
on the Lord's day. Got, she's dead.

253
00:11:07,060 --> 00:11:09,060
Cut her in half.

254
00:11:09,060 --> 00:11:11,060
All of his stuff, they don't try to do

255
00:11:11,060 --> 00:11:13,060
problematic prophylaxis on this biblical character

256
00:11:13,060 --> 00:11:15,060
just assuming there's some wack

257
00:11:15,060 --> 00:11:17,060
shit in Solomon's closet.

258
00:11:17,060 --> 00:11:19,060
Yeah, well, we talk about how it worked

259
00:11:19,060 --> 00:11:21,060
out with the baby, but it's never like, oh, cut the

260
00:11:21,060 --> 00:11:23,060
house in half. Oh, well, let's cut this.

261
00:11:23,060 --> 00:11:25,060
We'll cut that cow and stop trying to

262
00:11:25,060 --> 00:11:27,060
fucking cut stuff in half, Solomon.

263
00:11:27,060 --> 00:11:29,060
How close did he get? Was he like, I'm going to

264
00:11:29,060 --> 00:11:31,060
do it. I'm really going to do it.

265
00:11:31,060 --> 00:11:33,060
Why weren't... He had like a paper

266
00:11:33,060 --> 00:11:35,060
cutter that's just like, oh.

267
00:11:35,060 --> 00:11:37,060
I'm going to get him.

268
00:11:37,060 --> 00:11:39,060
I just want both people to be like

269
00:11:39,060 --> 00:11:41,060
doing this bare hands like the power team

270
00:11:41,060 --> 00:11:43,060
and he just, he came up with that ruling

271
00:11:43,060 --> 00:11:45,060
on the spot to save face.

272
00:11:45,060 --> 00:11:47,060
You don't want to actually...

273
00:11:47,060 --> 00:11:49,060
Nevermind. I don't want to tear the baby

274
00:11:49,060 --> 00:11:51,060
in half. You were going to let me do it.

275
00:11:51,060 --> 00:11:53,060
I saw in your face you didn't want me to.

276
00:11:53,060 --> 00:11:55,060
But you definitely were going to let me,

277
00:11:55,060 --> 00:11:57,060
so I'm giving it to her.

278
00:11:57,060 --> 00:11:59,060
What? What are you talking about?

279
00:11:59,060 --> 00:12:01,060
You tried to karate chop the baby.

280
00:12:01,060 --> 00:12:03,060
We both said stop.

281
00:12:03,060 --> 00:12:05,060
No, I can see she didn't mean it.

282
00:12:05,060 --> 00:12:07,060
When she said stop, she was totally cool

283
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:09,060
with me karate chopping this baby in half.

284
00:12:09,060 --> 00:12:13,060
What a dumb way of fixing the problem.

285
00:12:13,060 --> 00:12:15,060
I'm going to cut the baby in half.

286
00:12:15,060 --> 00:12:17,060
You're going to wait.

287
00:12:17,060 --> 00:12:19,060
We both know that baby won't keep

288
00:12:19,060 --> 00:12:21,060
working. Half a baby won't turn

289
00:12:21,060 --> 00:12:23,060
into a whole baby.

290
00:12:23,060 --> 00:12:25,060
He had to lean over to like the king's hand

291
00:12:25,060 --> 00:12:27,060
and be like, check this out.

292
00:12:27,060 --> 00:12:29,060
I'm going to go jazz on this one.

293
00:12:29,060 --> 00:12:31,060
I'm going to get a little loose.

294
00:12:31,060 --> 00:12:33,060
Just follow my lead.

295
00:12:33,060 --> 00:12:35,060
I bet you ten...

296
00:12:35,060 --> 00:12:37,060
Follow me in the key of G, my man.

297
00:12:39,060 --> 00:12:41,060
I bet you ten ducats this works.

298
00:12:43,060 --> 00:12:45,060
Ten bags of salt.

299
00:12:45,060 --> 00:12:47,060
Follow me on this one, man.

300
00:12:47,060 --> 00:12:49,060
But be ready to pull the record and laugh

301
00:12:49,060 --> 00:12:51,060
like it was a joke if they don't buy it.

302
00:12:51,060 --> 00:12:53,060
I'm the king. You got to do it.

303
00:12:53,060 --> 00:12:55,060
It is time for a fight.

304
00:12:59,060 --> 00:13:01,060
I've lost my monitor signal.

305
00:13:01,060 --> 00:13:03,060
One moment, please. Bear with.

306
00:13:03,060 --> 00:13:05,060
While Justin gets his monitor back in,

307
00:13:05,060 --> 00:13:07,060
I was thinking maybe we could raise

308
00:13:07,060 --> 00:13:09,060
the level of sophistication

309
00:13:09,060 --> 00:13:11,060
here on the show a little bit.

310
00:13:11,060 --> 00:13:13,060
There was a little ribaldry in there.

311
00:13:13,060 --> 00:13:15,060
King Solomon. It's very blue.

312
00:13:15,060 --> 00:13:17,060
I think it's time that we

313
00:13:17,060 --> 00:13:19,060
maybe take some time to appreciate.

314
00:13:19,060 --> 00:13:21,060
It's a work of fart.

315
00:13:21,060 --> 00:13:23,060
We know what it is it's going to be.

316
00:13:23,060 --> 00:13:25,060
We know your bits. We know what this is going to be.

317
00:13:25,060 --> 00:13:27,060
I know, but there's a lead-in to it, Griffin.

318
00:13:27,060 --> 00:13:29,060
Yeah, you got to let him work his magic.

319
00:13:29,060 --> 00:13:31,060
There's art to it, man.

320
00:13:31,060 --> 00:13:33,060
Sure. There's fart to it.

321
00:13:33,060 --> 00:13:35,060
Now, Griffin has shown...

322
00:13:35,060 --> 00:13:37,060
Fuck.

323
00:13:37,060 --> 00:13:39,060
What's wrong, Juice?

324
00:13:39,060 --> 00:13:41,060
No, he just burped and said fuck at the same time.

325
00:13:41,060 --> 00:13:43,060
It's hard standing up because

326
00:13:43,060 --> 00:13:45,060
my cords are not wanting to cooperate.

327
00:13:45,060 --> 00:13:47,060
Yeah, I had a real situation

328
00:13:47,060 --> 00:13:49,060
that I had to untangle while recording,

329
00:13:49,060 --> 00:13:51,060
but I'm fully dialed into your bit now, Travis,

330
00:13:51,060 --> 00:13:53,060
and I want you to start it.

331
00:13:53,060 --> 00:13:55,060
Now, Griffin, can you

332
00:13:55,060 --> 00:13:57,060
please fill the list, Marion?

333
00:13:57,060 --> 00:13:59,060
I don't want to do that for you.

334
00:13:59,060 --> 00:14:01,060
I'll do it. Here's how it works.

335
00:14:01,060 --> 00:14:03,060
Travis is going to come up with a

336
00:14:03,060 --> 00:14:05,060
a punny

337
00:14:05,060 --> 00:14:07,060
a punny name

338
00:14:07,060 --> 00:14:09,060
for a work of art that makes it

339
00:14:09,060 --> 00:14:11,060
ribald or blue.

340
00:14:11,060 --> 00:14:13,060
He's not going to say what it is.

341
00:14:13,060 --> 00:14:15,060
He's going to make us say it because

342
00:14:15,060 --> 00:14:17,060
that makes us complicit.

343
00:14:17,060 --> 00:14:19,060
He's going to come up with a punny name

344
00:14:19,060 --> 00:14:21,060
with a clue

345
00:14:21,060 --> 00:14:23,060
and then that we're complicit in the thing

346
00:14:23,060 --> 00:14:25,060
because we're actually the ones coming up with it.

347
00:14:25,060 --> 00:14:27,060
And this time, I'm going to change something slightly.

348
00:14:27,060 --> 00:14:29,060
You got to buzz in.

349
00:14:29,060 --> 00:14:31,060
You got to buzz in this time.

350
00:14:31,060 --> 00:14:33,060
Oh, interesting.

351
00:14:33,060 --> 00:14:35,060
And how do we do that?

352
00:14:35,060 --> 00:14:37,060
You can say whatever you want to.

353
00:14:37,060 --> 00:14:39,060
You don't have to say buzz, Griffin.

354
00:14:39,060 --> 00:14:41,060
The world's your oyster.

355
00:14:41,060 --> 00:14:43,060
A scientist resurrects a dead masturbator.

356
00:14:43,060 --> 00:14:45,060
But who's really the monster?

357
00:14:45,060 --> 00:14:47,060
Buzz, buzz.

358
00:14:47,060 --> 00:14:49,060
I heard Griffin's buzz first, but Justin's buzz most.

359
00:14:49,060 --> 00:14:51,060
Griffin?

360
00:14:51,060 --> 00:14:53,060
I'm going to say Wankenstein.

361
00:14:53,060 --> 00:14:55,060
That is correct. Wankenstein.

362
00:14:55,060 --> 00:14:57,060
Wow. Wow. Huge.

363
00:14:57,060 --> 00:14:59,060
It was either going to be that or Frankenstein.

364
00:14:59,060 --> 00:15:01,060
Not the most outside of the box one, if I'm being honest.

365
00:15:01,060 --> 00:15:03,060
Okay.

366
00:15:03,060 --> 00:15:05,060
That's the reason it was first.

367
00:15:05,060 --> 00:15:07,060
Check out the balls on this guy.

368
00:15:07,060 --> 00:15:09,060
He's tilting at windmills.

369
00:15:09,060 --> 00:15:11,060
Oh, I got it.

370
00:15:11,060 --> 00:15:13,060
Dang buzz.

371
00:15:13,060 --> 00:15:15,060
Is that Dong Quixote?

372
00:15:15,060 --> 00:15:17,060
No, I'm sorry. Justin?

373
00:15:17,060 --> 00:15:19,060
Wow.

374
00:15:19,060 --> 00:15:21,060
Say it one more time, please.

375
00:15:21,060 --> 00:15:23,060
Check out the balls on this guy.

376
00:15:23,060 --> 00:15:25,060
He's tilting at windmills.

377
00:15:25,060 --> 00:15:27,060
Yes, Justin?

378
00:15:27,060 --> 00:15:29,060
Dong Quixote?

379
00:15:29,060 --> 00:15:31,060
There it is. Yes.

380
00:15:31,060 --> 00:15:33,060
Oh, stop it.

381
00:15:33,060 --> 00:15:35,060
Well done. Okay, it's one and one.

382
00:15:35,060 --> 00:15:37,060
One and one.

383
00:15:37,060 --> 00:15:39,060
A famous detective is on the case

384
00:15:39,060 --> 00:15:41,060
when a man on a train shits himself to death.

385
00:15:41,060 --> 00:15:43,060
Huh.

386
00:15:43,060 --> 00:15:45,060
Say it one more time.

387
00:15:45,060 --> 00:15:47,060
A famous detective is on the case

388
00:15:47,060 --> 00:15:49,060
when a man on a train

389
00:15:49,060 --> 00:15:51,060
shits himself to death.

390
00:15:51,060 --> 00:15:53,060
A piece of that tip just got me, Odell.

391
00:15:53,060 --> 00:15:55,060
Yes, Justin?

392
00:15:55,060 --> 00:15:57,060
Is it Sharder on the Orient Express?

393
00:15:57,060 --> 00:15:59,060
Oh, no. So close.

394
00:15:59,060 --> 00:16:01,060
Is it Squirter on the more Orient Express?

395
00:16:01,060 --> 00:16:03,060
No, no. You're both wrong.

396
00:16:03,060 --> 00:16:05,060
It's Turter on the Orient Express.

397
00:16:05,060 --> 00:16:07,060
No, no, no.

398
00:16:07,060 --> 00:16:09,060
That's a weakness with the question.

399
00:16:09,060 --> 00:16:11,060
Okay, but Sharder doesn't rhyme with murder.

400
00:16:11,060 --> 00:16:13,060
Squirter does.

401
00:16:13,060 --> 00:16:15,060
And Squirter doesn't necessarily

402
00:16:15,060 --> 00:16:17,060
refer to proof.

403
00:16:17,060 --> 00:16:19,060
I don't want to get...

404
00:16:19,060 --> 00:16:21,060
I don't...

405
00:16:21,060 --> 00:16:23,060
Just go on.

406
00:16:23,060 --> 00:16:25,060
It makes me mad.

407
00:16:25,060 --> 00:16:27,060
Okay, it's one and one.

408
00:16:27,060 --> 00:16:29,060
It's like the concept of it is already so fucking rotten

409
00:16:29,060 --> 00:16:31,060
that when the execution is off,

410
00:16:31,060 --> 00:16:33,060
it's like, why are we...

411
00:16:33,060 --> 00:16:35,060
No. Hey, no.

412
00:16:35,060 --> 00:16:37,060
Just because you got the question wrong, Griffin,

413
00:16:37,060 --> 00:16:39,060
don't shit around on me.

414
00:16:39,060 --> 00:16:41,060
Don't make this like it's Travis's problem.

415
00:16:41,060 --> 00:16:43,060
Yeah, you said dong kihoti

416
00:16:43,060 --> 00:16:45,060
when I clearly said balls in the clue.

417
00:16:45,060 --> 00:16:47,060
You're right. And as we all know,

418
00:16:47,060 --> 00:16:49,060
dong refers pretty much mostly

419
00:16:49,060 --> 00:16:51,060
to the shaft.

420
00:16:51,060 --> 00:16:53,060
I have a diagram prepared.

421
00:16:53,060 --> 00:16:55,060
Look over here, guys.

422
00:16:55,060 --> 00:16:57,060
So just because you got it wrong, Griffin,

423
00:16:57,060 --> 00:16:59,060
doesn't mean the game's broken.

424
00:16:59,060 --> 00:17:01,060
I will say if someone's old balls popped out of their pants,

425
00:17:01,060 --> 00:17:03,060
you wouldn't point at the old balls and be like,

426
00:17:03,060 --> 00:17:05,060
look at that dong.

427
00:17:05,060 --> 00:17:07,060
This is referring to, you know,

428
00:17:07,060 --> 00:17:09,060
at the most sort of liberal interpretation,

429
00:17:09,060 --> 00:17:11,060
the whole kit.

430
00:17:11,060 --> 00:17:13,060
Right? And the caboodle.

431
00:17:13,060 --> 00:17:15,060
Maybe. Maybe.

432
00:17:15,060 --> 00:17:17,060
Okay. Next.

433
00:17:17,060 --> 00:17:19,060
Next bit.

434
00:17:19,060 --> 00:17:21,060
Next. Oh, are you done?

435
00:17:21,060 --> 00:17:23,060
Oh, next bit. I thought Travis had another one.

436
00:17:23,060 --> 00:17:25,060
No, I only did three.

437
00:17:25,060 --> 00:17:27,060
Somebody is going around my apartment complex

438
00:17:27,060 --> 00:17:29,060
and stealing all the catalytic converters.

439
00:17:29,060 --> 00:17:31,060
How do I protect mine?

440
00:17:31,060 --> 00:17:33,060
That's from catalytic chaos in Kentucky.

441
00:17:33,060 --> 00:17:35,060
Do you want to go ahead and do your

442
00:17:35,060 --> 00:17:37,060
usual thing, Juice?

443
00:17:37,060 --> 00:17:39,060
Just the thing you usually say

444
00:17:39,060 --> 00:17:41,060
that helps these kinds of situations.

445
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:43,060
Well, okay, yes.

446
00:17:43,060 --> 00:17:45,060
Yes. Well,

447
00:17:45,060 --> 00:17:47,060
I don't know. In this case.

448
00:17:47,060 --> 00:17:49,060
I don't know if putting jelly on it is going to be a good fix.

449
00:17:49,060 --> 00:17:51,060
It may catalyze the jelly.

450
00:17:51,060 --> 00:17:53,060
This is the concern.

451
00:17:53,060 --> 00:17:55,060
They get extremely hot, the catalytic converters.

452
00:17:55,060 --> 00:17:57,060
Yeah. Could you glue it in?

453
00:17:57,060 --> 00:17:59,060
Is that a problem?

454
00:17:59,060 --> 00:18:01,060
Yeah, what's keeping it in there anyway?

455
00:18:01,060 --> 00:18:03,060
It seems like it's not really in there good.

456
00:18:03,060 --> 00:18:05,060
I will say, I've owned

457
00:18:05,060 --> 00:18:07,060
a car or two in my day.

458
00:18:07,060 --> 00:18:09,060
It's easy to take stuff out of there.

459
00:18:09,060 --> 00:18:11,060
It's a lot harder to put it back in, I've found.

460
00:18:11,060 --> 00:18:13,060
Because sometimes they'll take something out and then be like,

461
00:18:13,060 --> 00:18:15,060
well, where the fuck does that even go?

462
00:18:15,060 --> 00:18:17,060
Because frankly, a lot of it is all kind of the same color.

463
00:18:17,060 --> 00:18:19,060
I've also noticed that.

464
00:18:19,060 --> 00:18:21,060
And so, like, if we could color

465
00:18:21,060 --> 00:18:23,060
code more of that stuff, that would be great.

466
00:18:23,060 --> 00:18:25,060
That would make it easier for thieves, for sure.

467
00:18:25,060 --> 00:18:27,060
You're not helping. You're making it harder.

468
00:18:27,060 --> 00:18:29,060
No. Oh, but then you paint your catalytic

469
00:18:29,060 --> 00:18:31,060
converter a different color.

470
00:18:31,060 --> 00:18:33,060
It'll burn the paint. Fuck!

471
00:18:33,060 --> 00:18:35,060
They get so fucking hot, dude.

472
00:18:35,060 --> 00:18:37,060
And this, can I say about this problem?

473
00:18:37,060 --> 00:18:39,060
We actually need to solve it

474
00:18:39,060 --> 00:18:41,060
pretty quickly, because this problem

475
00:18:41,060 --> 00:18:43,060
is only going to get worse.

476
00:18:43,060 --> 00:18:45,060
With the catalytic converter

477
00:18:45,060 --> 00:18:47,060
issue, with everything going on,

478
00:18:47,060 --> 00:18:49,060
this is just getting worse. So we need a solution.

479
00:18:49,060 --> 00:18:51,060
When the robots come around, they love eating it so much.

480
00:18:51,060 --> 00:18:53,060
No, it's because the catalytic converters

481
00:18:53,060 --> 00:18:55,060
got palladium, it's one of the precious metals

482
00:18:55,060 --> 00:18:57,060
that it uses.

483
00:18:57,060 --> 00:18:59,060
It's the favorite food of robots.

484
00:18:59,060 --> 00:19:01,060
Robots eat palladium and it gets stronger.

485
00:19:01,060 --> 00:19:03,060
I think so, too. I think robots

486
00:19:03,060 --> 00:19:05,060
do eat palladium and it gets stronger.

487
00:19:05,060 --> 00:19:07,060
If you put jelly on it, jelly will fucking burn

488
00:19:07,060 --> 00:19:09,060
right off. Nothing's fixed.

489
00:19:09,060 --> 00:19:11,060
Bait car. Bait car, Travis.

490
00:19:11,060 --> 00:19:13,060
Let me tell you. Bait car.

491
00:19:13,060 --> 00:19:15,060
This catalytic converter, it's rigged to blow.

492
00:19:15,060 --> 00:19:17,060
Not for, well, that's, now we're talking

493
00:19:17,060 --> 00:19:19,060
about killing people because they steal

494
00:19:19,060 --> 00:19:21,060
the car part for money. How many catalytic

495
00:19:21,060 --> 00:19:23,060
converters? Let me ask you guys. I just want to

496
00:19:23,060 --> 00:19:25,060
just say a number. Don't think about it.

497
00:19:25,060 --> 00:19:27,060
How many catalytic converters would someone

498
00:19:27,060 --> 00:19:29,060
have to steal before

499
00:19:29,060 --> 00:19:31,060
exploding them with a bait car would be

500
00:19:31,060 --> 00:19:33,060
the appropriate proportional response?

501
00:19:33,060 --> 00:19:35,060
None. Travis, you're asking

502
00:19:35,060 --> 00:19:37,060
at what point is

503
00:19:37,060 --> 00:19:39,060
murder okay for that? No, no, no. That's

504
00:19:39,060 --> 00:19:41,060
not what I said. I said blowing them up.

505
00:19:41,060 --> 00:19:43,060
It sounds like what you're saying is that

506
00:19:43,060 --> 00:19:45,060
exclusively.

507
00:19:45,060 --> 00:19:47,060
Blowing up doesn't have to be murder.

508
00:19:47,060 --> 00:19:49,060
It can just pop in their face. Maybe an ink.

509
00:19:49,060 --> 00:19:51,060
It can be like the guy who makes the bait

510
00:19:51,060 --> 00:19:53,060
Amazon packages that people

511
00:19:53,060 --> 00:19:55,060
steal and then it farts and

512
00:19:55,060 --> 00:19:57,060
you hear fucking Bill

513
00:19:57,060 --> 00:19:59,060
Ingvall come out of a speaker like,

514
00:19:59,060 --> 00:20:01,060
here's your sign, and you're like,

515
00:20:01,060 --> 00:20:03,060
yeah, get those fucking people.

516
00:20:03,060 --> 00:20:05,060
Get those thieves. Yeah, maybe like a

517
00:20:05,060 --> 00:20:07,060
permanent ink situation.

518
00:20:07,060 --> 00:20:09,060
Oh, you removed the catalytic converter.

519
00:20:09,060 --> 00:20:11,060
I don't know what you're talking about. Yeah, you do.

520
00:20:11,060 --> 00:20:13,060
Purple face. I don't enjoy

521
00:20:13,060 --> 00:20:15,060
I guess

522
00:20:15,060 --> 00:20:17,060
like capital punishment, which is

523
00:20:17,060 --> 00:20:19,060
what you seem to be a huge

524
00:20:19,060 --> 00:20:21,060
fan of. I'm talking about spraying them with

525
00:20:21,060 --> 00:20:23,060
ink, Griffin. Though that is

526
00:20:23,060 --> 00:20:25,060
I don't know if it's cruel, but it is unusual.

527
00:20:25,060 --> 00:20:27,060
I don't think it's cruel or unusual

528
00:20:27,060 --> 00:20:29,060
punishment though. So

529
00:20:29,060 --> 00:20:31,060
I would say that you know how

530
00:20:31,060 --> 00:20:33,060
like the like really

531
00:20:33,060 --> 00:20:35,060
fancy stock cars or whatever

532
00:20:35,060 --> 00:20:37,060
like there's people who will just like

533
00:20:37,060 --> 00:20:39,060
pop the steering wheel out and they can take the

534
00:20:39,060 --> 00:20:41,060
steering wheel. What if you just could do that with

535
00:20:41,060 --> 00:20:43,060
your catalytic converter? Like

536
00:20:43,060 --> 00:20:45,060
you just slide on under there and you like

537
00:20:45,060 --> 00:20:47,060
push in on it really hard and

538
00:20:47,060 --> 00:20:49,060
it pops and it pops out and you can take it

539
00:20:49,060 --> 00:20:51,060
with you to work. What about one of those

540
00:20:51,060 --> 00:20:53,060
you know in like the 90s where they had those

541
00:20:53,060 --> 00:20:55,060
like diaries where

542
00:20:55,060 --> 00:20:57,060
you had to like voice activate it for

543
00:20:57,060 --> 00:20:59,060
kids so that your sneaky little brother

544
00:20:59,060 --> 00:21:01,060
couldn't get in there and you had to be like

545
00:21:01,060 --> 00:21:03,060
dreamboat in order to like open the thing

546
00:21:03,060 --> 00:21:05,060
maybe you put a voice activated lock.

547
00:21:05,060 --> 00:21:07,060
I have no idea what, I have no idea what you're talking about.

548
00:21:07,060 --> 00:21:09,060
You don't remember that? That was like a

549
00:21:09,060 --> 00:21:11,060
voice activated diary? It wasn't a

550
00:21:11,060 --> 00:21:13,060
voice activated diary, it had a lock on it.

551
00:21:13,060 --> 00:21:15,060
It had a voice activated lock on it. Yes,

552
00:21:15,060 --> 00:21:17,060
that's true, yes. And you would say like

553
00:21:17,060 --> 00:21:19,060
you would say the code word so your sneaky little

554
00:21:19,060 --> 00:21:21,060
brother, that creep, couldn't get in there

555
00:21:21,060 --> 00:21:23,060
and read as you were writing about all the people you had crushes on.

556
00:21:23,060 --> 00:21:25,060
You know,

557
00:21:25,060 --> 00:21:27,060
put that on your card. I bet I could have cracked

558
00:21:27,060 --> 00:21:29,060
your fucking code Trav easy. It was

559
00:21:29,060 --> 00:21:31,060
DuckTales. I just walked up to it

560
00:21:31,060 --> 00:21:33,060
and just been like,

561
00:21:33,060 --> 00:21:35,060
Xanth, Xena, and then it would have just popped

562
00:21:35,060 --> 00:21:37,060
right up and revealed all your fucking secrets to me.

563
00:21:37,060 --> 00:21:39,060
It was actually Xena, then Xanth.

564
00:21:39,060 --> 00:21:41,060
Oh, I apologize. Yeah, thank you.

565
00:21:41,060 --> 00:21:43,060
Juicy okay.

566
00:21:43,060 --> 00:21:45,060
Justin, are you reading about what

567
00:21:45,060 --> 00:21:47,060
catalytic converters do?

568
00:21:47,060 --> 00:21:49,060
No, I know what they do. Now?

569
00:21:49,060 --> 00:21:51,060
No, I knew before that. Oh, did you?

570
00:21:51,060 --> 00:21:53,060
I was talking about it before the pause,

571
00:21:53,060 --> 00:21:55,060
Travis. Uh-huh, because you looked it up.

572
00:21:55,060 --> 00:21:57,060
Review the tape. Because you looked it up.

573
00:21:57,060 --> 00:21:59,060
No, I know because...

574
00:21:59,060 --> 00:22:01,060
Okay, doesn't matter. That's not funny

575
00:22:01,060 --> 00:22:03,060
for me to talk about that I know this.

576
00:22:03,060 --> 00:22:05,060
It's not funny. You can get a lock

577
00:22:05,060 --> 00:22:07,060
for them. There, if you don't want to be

578
00:22:07,060 --> 00:22:09,060
funny, Travis, there. You can get a lock

579
00:22:09,060 --> 00:22:11,060
for it. Oh, I thought you said

580
00:22:11,060 --> 00:22:13,060
you could get a lot for them and we were going to talk

581
00:22:13,060 --> 00:22:15,060
about the price. No, you can't get a lock

582
00:22:15,060 --> 00:22:17,060
for it, actually. How much do you think...

583
00:22:17,060 --> 00:22:19,060
Wait, okay, listen. How much do you think you could

584
00:22:19,060 --> 00:22:21,060
give for a catalytic converter?

585
00:22:21,060 --> 00:22:23,060
I know that it costs like two Gs to replace it.

586
00:22:23,060 --> 00:22:25,060
Oh, yeah, really? It's probably less than that.

587
00:22:25,060 --> 00:22:27,060
So I could probably get like a thousand...

588
00:22:27,060 --> 00:22:29,060
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

589
00:22:29,060 --> 00:22:31,060
Hey. Yeah? Hold on a second.

590
00:22:31,060 --> 00:22:33,060
What if you stole your own catalytic converter?

591
00:22:33,060 --> 00:22:35,060
Oh, they'd never see that coming.

592
00:22:35,060 --> 00:22:37,060
Then the thief comes along and like, well, fuck.

593
00:22:37,060 --> 00:22:39,060
Somebody already hit this one.

594
00:22:39,060 --> 00:22:41,060
Listen, it's not a good for your environment,

595
00:22:41,060 --> 00:22:43,060
but one car

596
00:22:43,060 --> 00:22:45,060
cruising around, putting that bad

597
00:22:45,060 --> 00:22:47,060
air gravy

598
00:22:47,060 --> 00:22:49,060
out and it's not being purified

599
00:22:49,060 --> 00:22:51,060
by the catalytic

600
00:22:51,060 --> 00:22:53,060
converter. It's not that bad.

601
00:22:53,060 --> 00:22:55,060
Just do it. It's just one.

602
00:22:55,060 --> 00:22:57,060
It's just one. It's like a drop in the bucket.

603
00:22:57,060 --> 00:22:59,060
Do you know what that is? Like cranking out that fog gravy

604
00:22:59,060 --> 00:23:01,060
constantly. Yeah, that bad gravy.

605
00:23:01,060 --> 00:23:03,060
Just do what that kid in my dorm floor did

606
00:23:03,060 --> 00:23:05,060
whenever he wanted to smoke weed.

607
00:23:05,060 --> 00:23:07,060
Just put a

608
00:23:07,060 --> 00:23:09,060
dryer sheet over your tailpipe.

609
00:23:09,060 --> 00:23:11,060
It'll basically do the same thing.

610
00:23:11,060 --> 00:23:13,060
It's going to blow some clean

611
00:23:13,060 --> 00:23:15,060
cool, clean linen smell through there.

612
00:23:15,060 --> 00:23:17,060
You're going to be fine. I had a friend who called that a

613
00:23:17,060 --> 00:23:19,060
wookie tube. I don't know if that was something other people

614
00:23:19,060 --> 00:23:21,060
call it, but you would take a paper, like a paper

615
00:23:21,060 --> 00:23:23,060
towel roll, like the cardboard

616
00:23:23,060 --> 00:23:25,060
part of it, and you would stuff it with dryer sheets

617
00:23:25,060 --> 00:23:27,060
and then you would rip the bong

618
00:23:27,060 --> 00:23:29,060
and then you would put your mouth on that tube and

619
00:23:29,060 --> 00:23:31,060
you would breathe out into it. And maybe

620
00:23:31,060 --> 00:23:33,060
it's just because he did call it a wookie tube, but we would

621
00:23:33,060 --> 00:23:35,060
of course, like when we breathed out, just be like

622
00:23:35,060 --> 00:23:37,060
vvvrtttttt.

623
00:23:37,060 --> 00:23:39,060
And we would laugh

624
00:23:39,060 --> 00:23:41,060
and laugh and laugh. Because it was funny!

625
00:23:41,060 --> 00:23:43,060
Okay because it was funny and it was a

626
00:23:43,060 --> 00:23:45,060
different time so I'm wondering if you could do that

627
00:23:45,060 --> 00:23:47,060
into a catalytic converter, what would come out the other

628
00:23:47,060 --> 00:23:49,060
side of it. Oh great question, yeah

629
00:23:49,060 --> 00:23:51,060
yeah yeah. Maybe that's it, maybe there's somebody

630
00:23:51,060 --> 00:23:53,060
stealing your catalytic converter so they can blow their weed

631
00:23:53,060 --> 00:23:55,060
smoke through it without getting caught.

632
00:23:55,060 --> 00:23:57,060
That's, yeah. Can you think about that? Maybe they need it more than you.

633
00:23:57,060 --> 00:23:59,060
Thank you,

634
00:23:59,060 --> 00:24:01,060
yes! Here's another question.

635
00:24:01,060 --> 00:24:03,060
I recently received a very nice

636
00:24:03,060 --> 00:24:05,300
handwritten card from my grandma.

637
00:24:07,300 --> 00:24:09,300
I actually received a very nice handwritten card

638
00:24:09,300 --> 00:24:11,860
from their grandma, too, so there, that's nice.

639
00:24:11,860 --> 00:24:12,700
Oh, thanks.

640
00:24:12,700 --> 00:24:14,540
Your grandma loves us, too.

641
00:24:14,540 --> 00:24:17,140
Thanks for the good time.

642
00:24:18,460 --> 00:24:22,060
We went and saw Death on the Nile together.

643
00:24:22,060 --> 00:24:22,900
We had a great time.

644
00:24:22,900 --> 00:24:24,540
Don't tease me, I'd love to get out there for that.

645
00:24:24,540 --> 00:24:25,900
Oh yeah, me too.

646
00:24:25,900 --> 00:24:28,740
She said she was going through some old family pictures

647
00:24:28,740 --> 00:24:30,860
and sending them, did I mention the baby pictures

648
00:24:30,860 --> 00:24:32,860
or did you guys start doing your bits before I said that?

649
00:24:32,860 --> 00:24:34,180
I don't know.

650
00:24:34,180 --> 00:24:36,100
There were baby pictures inside the card.

651
00:24:36,100 --> 00:24:37,880
She said she was going through some old family pictures

652
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:40,500
and sending them to the families of who was in the picture,

653
00:24:40,500 --> 00:24:42,620
meaning I should have received old pictures of myself.

654
00:24:42,620 --> 00:24:45,620
However, these pictures aren't of me.

655
00:24:45,620 --> 00:24:47,300
I asked my mom, she has no idea

656
00:24:47,300 --> 00:24:48,900
who is actually in those pictures,

657
00:24:48,900 --> 00:24:50,500
but it sure isn't me.

658
00:24:50,500 --> 00:24:53,140
Brothers, what do I do with these pictures?

659
00:24:53,140 --> 00:24:55,300
Do I send them back to her and correct her?

660
00:24:55,300 --> 00:24:56,140
Yeah.

661
00:24:56,140 --> 00:24:57,220
Yeah, that'd be good.

662
00:24:57,220 --> 00:24:58,060
Oh, wrong!

663
00:24:58,060 --> 00:25:00,660
You knew it wasn't that one, right?

664
00:25:00,660 --> 00:25:02,500
Just fucking kicking the door out of your house

665
00:25:02,500 --> 00:25:03,740
and just rubbing her face.

666
00:25:03,740 --> 00:25:04,580
Wrong!

667
00:25:04,580 --> 00:25:05,420
Wrong!

668
00:25:05,420 --> 00:25:06,820
You think it's me?

669
00:25:06,820 --> 00:25:07,660
Hey, Dweeb.

670
00:25:08,900 --> 00:25:10,460
You blew it!

671
00:25:10,460 --> 00:25:11,300
Blew it, Dweeb.

672
00:25:11,300 --> 00:25:14,220
You're wrong, now eat them, eat the pictures, grandma!

673
00:25:14,220 --> 00:25:15,060
Wrong!

674
00:25:17,220 --> 00:25:18,540
Do I send them back?

675
00:25:18,540 --> 00:25:19,940
Obviously not.

676
00:25:19,940 --> 00:25:22,180
Or just, should I just try to track down

677
00:25:22,180 --> 00:25:24,620
who is in these pictures or is it a lost cause?

678
00:25:24,620 --> 00:25:27,180
I mean, there's no reason,

679
00:25:27,180 --> 00:25:31,980
why are these pictures chained to their physical form?

680
00:25:31,980 --> 00:25:33,820
It's time to set them free.

681
00:25:33,820 --> 00:25:37,220
Get them up on the internet, just be like,

682
00:25:37,220 --> 00:25:39,980
don't put them on Facebook though, that'll be too easy.

683
00:25:39,980 --> 00:25:42,820
You need to put them on ancestry.com or something,

684
00:25:42,820 --> 00:25:45,180
just be like, hey, got some new pics?

685
00:25:45,180 --> 00:25:46,020
New pics of this.

686
00:25:46,020 --> 00:25:48,060
What do you think ancestry.com does?

687
00:25:48,060 --> 00:25:50,860
Because they definitely don't have-

688
00:25:50,860 --> 00:25:53,220
You know how they cross-reference

689
00:25:53,220 --> 00:25:55,220
facial recognition, baby photos.

690
00:25:55,220 --> 00:25:58,020
No, I'm saying you put them up on the family tree,

691
00:25:58,020 --> 00:26:00,580
but just put them on the miscellaneous branch

692
00:26:00,580 --> 00:26:02,940
and let people come and claim them.

693
00:26:02,940 --> 00:26:04,900
Well, it's like a little squirrel on the family tree

694
00:26:04,900 --> 00:26:07,100
is this weird baby.

695
00:26:07,100 --> 00:26:08,820
More like a nut.

696
00:26:08,820 --> 00:26:09,660
What?

697
00:26:09,660 --> 00:26:11,660
More like a nut.

698
00:26:11,660 --> 00:26:12,500
Yeah.

699
00:26:12,500 --> 00:26:15,260
Hey, my family tree's got a few nuts on it.

700
00:26:16,340 --> 00:26:17,180
Yeah.

701
00:26:19,580 --> 00:26:20,740
Like testicles?

702
00:26:21,780 --> 00:26:23,180
I was listening for,

703
00:26:23,180 --> 00:26:24,940
I've been listening to encyclopedia brown books

704
00:26:24,940 --> 00:26:27,140
with Charlie when we go to school,

705
00:26:27,140 --> 00:26:29,700
Wake Up Her Mind to Mystery,

706
00:26:29,700 --> 00:26:32,340
and the burns in that book that Bugs Me does

707
00:26:32,340 --> 00:26:36,620
are so fucking wretched that I cannot even process

708
00:26:36,620 --> 00:26:38,100
how bad this is.

709
00:26:38,100 --> 00:26:39,940
Like the one we listened to this morning,

710
00:26:39,940 --> 00:26:42,060
Bugs and Encyclopedia Browns-

711
00:26:42,060 --> 00:26:42,900
What Bugs do?

712
00:26:42,900 --> 00:26:43,900
What Bugs do?

713
00:26:43,900 --> 00:26:44,740
Listen, shut up.

714
00:26:44,740 --> 00:26:45,580
Okay, I'm trying to.

715
00:26:45,580 --> 00:26:48,580
Bugs is like, if Encyclopedia Brown's like,

716
00:26:48,580 --> 00:26:52,100
hey, Gundam, I know you ate this kid's cherries,

717
00:26:52,100 --> 00:26:55,260
and I give them back or give them some money for them,

718
00:26:55,260 --> 00:26:57,300
and Bugs is like, huh,

719
00:26:57,300 --> 00:27:00,580
you better stay away from a candy factory

720
00:27:00,580 --> 00:27:03,220
because they're looking for nuts like you.

721
00:27:03,220 --> 00:27:04,060
It's like Bugs.

722
00:27:04,060 --> 00:27:05,380
Fucking killed it.

723
00:27:05,380 --> 00:27:06,220
Dude, hey, Bugs.

724
00:27:06,220 --> 00:27:08,060
Bugs, dude, we don't say shit like that in VR.

725
00:27:08,060 --> 00:27:10,740
Hey, pick up your face, Encyclopedia.

726
00:27:10,740 --> 00:27:12,020
He just melted it right off.

727
00:27:12,020 --> 00:27:13,540
Stick to punching.

728
00:27:13,540 --> 00:27:14,660
Yeah, stick to punching

729
00:27:14,660 --> 00:27:16,940
because you could really hurt somebody's feelings by-

730
00:27:16,940 --> 00:27:17,780
I mean, fuck it.

731
00:27:17,780 --> 00:27:20,780
Encyclopedia Brown is so lucky that Sally's around.

732
00:27:20,780 --> 00:27:21,980
Yeah, to defend.

733
00:27:21,980 --> 00:27:24,060
Because fucking Bugs would just murder him.

734
00:27:24,060 --> 00:27:25,820
Walk all over him, yeah.

735
00:27:25,820 --> 00:27:27,260
I came up with a great idea to do

736
00:27:27,260 --> 00:27:28,540
an adult Encyclopedia Brown,

737
00:27:28,540 --> 00:27:30,380
and then I realized that John Hodgman and Dave Reese

738
00:27:30,380 --> 00:27:32,100
did that with their hit series, Dicktown, on Hulu.

739
00:27:32,100 --> 00:27:35,740
Well, also the Adam Brody movie, Boy, Detective.

740
00:27:35,740 --> 00:27:38,020
And also Brick, if you think about it.

741
00:27:38,020 --> 00:27:41,100
Yeah, and Sherlock Holmes.

742
00:27:41,100 --> 00:27:43,020
Did you guys know that House

743
00:27:43,020 --> 00:27:45,500
is an adaptation of Sherlock Holmes?

744
00:27:45,500 --> 00:27:46,460
Fuck, man.

745
00:27:46,460 --> 00:27:47,900
Thank you, let's talk about it.

746
00:27:47,900 --> 00:27:50,580
Because we don't have detectives anymore.

747
00:27:50,580 --> 00:27:54,860
And that dude from Dead Poets Society is his Watson?

748
00:27:54,860 --> 00:27:56,980
I'm gonna, can I do something else for you guys?

749
00:27:56,980 --> 00:28:00,460
I want to be straight up with you guys.

750
00:28:00,460 --> 00:28:02,500
Fully, fully honest transparency.

751
00:28:02,500 --> 00:28:03,340
Just listen.

752
00:28:03,340 --> 00:28:04,660
Listen to Griffin, he's about to admit

753
00:28:04,660 --> 00:28:05,500
he's never watched House.

754
00:28:05,500 --> 00:28:06,660
Fully transparent.

755
00:28:06,660 --> 00:28:08,140
No, it's not that I haven't watched it.

756
00:28:08,140 --> 00:28:10,700
It's that I really have, I have so,

757
00:28:10,700 --> 00:28:12,060
I don't have any interest

758
00:28:12,060 --> 00:28:13,980
in talking about this kind of subject.

759
00:28:13,980 --> 00:28:18,180
And I was wondering if I could be excused.

760
00:28:18,180 --> 00:28:19,740
If you guys are about to go on a run

761
00:28:19,740 --> 00:28:21,860
and sometimes I feel that energy building,

762
00:28:21,860 --> 00:28:22,940
I was wondering if I could be,

763
00:28:22,940 --> 00:28:24,540
may I please be excused from the podcast?

764
00:28:24,540 --> 00:28:26,420
Everyone gets one.

765
00:28:26,420 --> 00:28:27,980
You want to use yours now, Griffin?

766
00:28:27,980 --> 00:28:31,620
We should get a monthly get out a bit free card.

767
00:28:32,660 --> 00:28:33,900
You guys were about to talk about

768
00:28:33,900 --> 00:28:37,260
how House is like Sherlock Holmes.

769
00:28:37,260 --> 00:28:39,060
And I'm like, where's the fucking door?

770
00:28:39,060 --> 00:28:40,940
House is not like Sherlock Holmes.

771
00:28:40,940 --> 00:28:44,660
House is an adaptation of Sherlock Holmes.

772
00:28:44,660 --> 00:28:45,940
I felt my bladder go,

773
00:28:45,940 --> 00:28:47,580
well, you just peed right before recording,

774
00:28:47,580 --> 00:28:51,660
but maybe you could use me to get away from here.

775
00:28:51,660 --> 00:28:54,620
Use me, Griffin, to get away from here.

776
00:28:54,620 --> 00:28:56,300
Oh, it's Wilson instead of Watson.

777
00:28:56,300 --> 00:28:57,300
Yeah.

778
00:28:57,300 --> 00:28:59,140
Oh, that's how they get, that's how they trick people.

779
00:28:59,140 --> 00:29:01,700
That's how they get around the non-existent.

780
00:29:01,700 --> 00:29:02,660
They don't like that.

781
00:29:02,660 --> 00:29:04,420
The Sherlock Holmes estate.

782
00:29:05,780 --> 00:29:07,900
The estate of Sherlock Holmes.

783
00:29:07,900 --> 00:29:09,300
Hi, I'm Doug Holmes.

784
00:29:09,300 --> 00:29:10,300
I'm Doug Holmes.

785
00:29:10,300 --> 00:29:11,980
And I heard that you were making a thing

786
00:29:11,980 --> 00:29:13,860
about my great-great-granddaddy.

787
00:29:13,860 --> 00:29:14,700
Gotta call it up.

788
00:29:14,700 --> 00:29:16,300
Your character himself is entered into the public domain,

789
00:29:16,300 --> 00:29:18,380
but many of the stories and elements from those stories

790
00:29:18,380 --> 00:29:19,220
are protected.

791
00:29:19,220 --> 00:29:21,020
Oh, I see.

792
00:29:21,020 --> 00:29:23,540
But they're intense about it.

793
00:29:23,540 --> 00:29:25,820
They're like, don't make Sherlock nice.

794
00:29:25,820 --> 00:29:27,380
He's a weird dick.

795
00:29:27,380 --> 00:29:29,140
You gotta make him a butthole.

796
00:29:29,140 --> 00:29:32,820
No, again, the character is in the public domain,

797
00:29:32,820 --> 00:29:35,180
so it could be like Sherlock Holmes

798
00:29:35,180 --> 00:29:37,540
in the mystery of the perfect beach body,

799
00:29:37,540 --> 00:29:38,700
and it's a different version.

800
00:29:38,700 --> 00:29:40,020
Like, there's no rules there.

801
00:29:40,020 --> 00:29:42,020
Whoa, whoa, whoa, wait, really?

802
00:29:42,020 --> 00:29:43,900
We could do like, my brother and my brother and me

803
00:29:43,900 --> 00:29:46,820
presents Sherlock Holmes Day about town,

804
00:29:46,820 --> 00:29:49,860
and it's just like Baby's Day out, but Sherlock Holmes?

805
00:29:49,860 --> 00:29:54,100
Well, in Taz, we absolutely did a Sherlock Holmes episode.

806
00:29:54,100 --> 00:29:55,100
We called it that, remember?

807
00:29:55,100 --> 00:29:56,820
Oh, yeah.

808
00:29:56,820 --> 00:29:57,940
Yeah.

809
00:29:57,940 --> 00:30:01,140
Everything old is new again, as they say.

810
00:30:01,140 --> 00:30:02,860
You guys wanna get paid?

811
00:30:02,860 --> 00:30:03,700
Yeah, let's go.

812
00:30:03,700 --> 00:30:04,540
I guess.

813
00:30:04,540 --> 00:30:05,380
Follow me.

814
00:30:05,380 --> 00:30:06,420
Where are we going?

815
00:30:06,420 --> 00:30:07,420
To the money zone.

816
00:30:07,420 --> 00:30:10,100
Oh, it kinda felt like I was setting it up,

817
00:30:10,100 --> 00:30:11,980
and then you kinda stepped in front of me.

818
00:30:11,980 --> 00:30:14,580
I thought you were setting me up to...

819
00:30:14,580 --> 00:30:16,140
Let's go together.

820
00:30:16,140 --> 00:30:17,660
Okay, take my hand.

821
00:30:17,660 --> 00:30:20,900
Oh, wow, there's three sets of footprints on the beach.

822
00:30:20,900 --> 00:30:23,660
It's better, it's better with you.

823
00:30:29,540 --> 00:30:33,460
Squarespace, what more needs to be said?

824
00:30:33,460 --> 00:30:34,900
Nothing, next ad.

825
00:30:34,900 --> 00:30:37,700
Well, there is copy, we do need to say...

826
00:30:37,700 --> 00:30:39,540
I've been using Squarespace.

827
00:30:39,540 --> 00:30:40,780
Okay. What for?

828
00:30:40,780 --> 00:30:45,780
For Sydney's campaign website, McElroy4WV.com.

829
00:30:45,780 --> 00:30:48,460
If you go there, you can see a Squarespace website

830
00:30:48,460 --> 00:30:51,180
that I built with the help of my friend Michael.

831
00:30:51,180 --> 00:30:53,940
He helped me sort of get it set up,

832
00:30:53,940 --> 00:30:55,740
and then I'm doing updates.

833
00:30:55,740 --> 00:30:58,620
It's so easy to make big changes, little changes.

834
00:30:58,620 --> 00:31:01,380
Just like big changes in the government.

835
00:31:01,380 --> 00:31:02,220
Wow.

836
00:31:02,220 --> 00:31:03,740
Thank you, that's beautiful, Travis.

837
00:31:03,740 --> 00:31:04,780
That's really good, Travis.

838
00:31:04,780 --> 00:31:05,620
You know, it's not just...

839
00:31:05,620 --> 00:31:07,180
You can use that too, Juice.

840
00:31:07,180 --> 00:31:08,020
Yeah.

841
00:31:08,020 --> 00:31:08,900
It's not just political campaigns.

842
00:31:08,900 --> 00:31:10,780
Do you wanna use that of like Sydney McElroy

843
00:31:10,780 --> 00:31:14,420
will do for government what I do on a Squarespace website?

844
00:31:14,420 --> 00:31:16,660
No, I don't think I'll use it,

845
00:31:16,660 --> 00:31:19,140
but I will use customizable galleries

846
00:31:19,140 --> 00:31:23,540
to display images and videos in unique ways.

847
00:31:23,540 --> 00:31:28,180
I'll use it to sell products on an online store.

848
00:31:28,180 --> 00:31:29,020
And every Squarespace website-

849
00:31:29,020 --> 00:31:29,860
What are you selling?

850
00:31:29,860 --> 00:31:30,700
What are you selling?

851
00:31:30,700 --> 00:31:32,420
What are you selling?

852
00:31:32,420 --> 00:31:33,260
T-shirts.

853
00:31:35,260 --> 00:31:37,820
Look at this, I've got all the size,

854
00:31:37,820 --> 00:31:40,060
but I'm running out of larges.

855
00:31:40,060 --> 00:31:42,580
It's a very popular size.

856
00:31:42,580 --> 00:31:44,660
They're made to order on things.

857
00:31:44,660 --> 00:31:46,660
You'll get it in three weeks.

858
00:31:46,660 --> 00:31:50,140
They're so soft, I'm wearing one now and you had no idea.

859
00:31:50,140 --> 00:31:53,780
Assuming there's not supply chain issues.

860
00:31:53,780 --> 00:31:54,940
I'm saying it's really easy to do.

861
00:31:54,940 --> 00:31:56,620
You don't need to know internet at all.

862
00:31:56,620 --> 00:31:58,620
You just like, just go for it.

863
00:31:58,620 --> 00:32:00,500
Let your heart go free.

864
00:32:00,500 --> 00:32:02,140
Even if you don't have like a design background,

865
00:32:02,140 --> 00:32:04,460
the elements that they have that you can pull in

866
00:32:04,460 --> 00:32:07,220
are like already sort of designed and look good together.

867
00:32:07,220 --> 00:32:10,020
It's really fun and easy to use.

868
00:32:10,020 --> 00:32:13,820
Head to squarespace.com slash my brother for a free trial.

869
00:32:13,820 --> 00:32:14,900
And when you're ready to launch,

870
00:32:14,900 --> 00:32:17,140
use the offer code my brother to save 10%

871
00:32:17,140 --> 00:32:20,300
off your first purchase of a website or domain.

872
00:32:20,300 --> 00:32:22,780
Griffin, what's on your feet right now?

873
00:32:22,780 --> 00:32:24,940
List off everything.

874
00:32:24,940 --> 00:32:27,980
Just lots of open source.

875
00:32:27,980 --> 00:32:30,540
Oh boy, close those up.

876
00:32:30,540 --> 00:32:32,100
Bunch of, yeah, okay, travel.

877
00:32:32,100 --> 00:32:32,940
Let me just close them up

878
00:32:32,940 --> 00:32:36,100
because I'm Wolverine with a mutant healing factor.

879
00:32:36,100 --> 00:32:37,140
Okay, are you done?

880
00:32:37,140 --> 00:32:40,020
Yeah, I actually, I feel much better now.

881
00:32:40,020 --> 00:32:41,660
Thanks for giving me that time that I needed

882
00:32:41,660 --> 00:32:43,020
to fix my shit.

883
00:32:43,020 --> 00:32:45,740
Well, Griffin, maybe you wouldn't have so many open source

884
00:32:45,740 --> 00:32:47,900
on your feet if you would put on some Bombas socks.

885
00:32:47,900 --> 00:32:51,300
You see Griffin, Bombas' mission is simple, Griffin.

886
00:32:51,300 --> 00:32:54,060
Make the most comfortable clothes ever, Griffin,

887
00:32:54,060 --> 00:32:57,540
and match every item sold with an equal item donated.

888
00:32:57,540 --> 00:33:00,020
So Griffin, when you buy Bombas,

889
00:33:00,020 --> 00:33:03,580
you are also giving to someone in need.

890
00:33:03,580 --> 00:33:06,740
Because Griffin, everything they make is soft, Griffin,

891
00:33:06,740 --> 00:33:09,020
seamless, Griffin, and tagless, Griffin.

892
00:33:09,020 --> 00:33:12,900
And it has a luxury, Griffin, cozy feel.

893
00:33:12,900 --> 00:33:14,540
I do like Bombas socks though, for real.

894
00:33:14,540 --> 00:33:16,700
I feel like sometimes we have too much fun with the ads

895
00:33:16,700 --> 00:33:19,020
and people don't realize that.

896
00:33:19,020 --> 00:33:21,260
I actually, I do like these socks quite a bit.

897
00:33:21,260 --> 00:33:22,980
They're very comfortable.

898
00:33:22,980 --> 00:33:25,620
Yeah, sometimes people miss that it's a joke

899
00:33:25,620 --> 00:33:28,420
that Griffin didn't wear socks so much

900
00:33:28,420 --> 00:33:30,060
that he got open source on his feet.

901
00:33:30,060 --> 00:33:32,860
I do wear socks because I gotta have my Bombas.

902
00:33:32,860 --> 00:33:34,940
That's what I say, that's what I like to say.

903
00:33:34,940 --> 00:33:36,340
Gotta have my Bombas.

904
00:33:36,340 --> 00:33:39,700
Rachel actually contacted us and said that you say that

905
00:33:39,700 --> 00:33:41,260
at inappropriate times.

906
00:33:42,180 --> 00:33:44,260
She asked us to talk to you about it.

907
00:33:44,260 --> 00:33:46,180
Like the kids wake up in the middle of the night

908
00:33:46,180 --> 00:33:47,180
and they're like, Daddy, I'm so scared.

909
00:33:47,180 --> 00:33:48,940
And I'm like, gotta have my Bombas.

910
00:33:48,940 --> 00:33:52,540
Yeah, she said that there was a parent teacher conference

911
00:33:52,540 --> 00:33:54,820
where the teacher said like, any questions?

912
00:33:54,820 --> 00:33:57,180
And you just yelled, gotta have my Bombas,

913
00:33:57,180 --> 00:33:58,900
and then hung up the phone.

914
00:33:58,900 --> 00:34:01,020
Yeah, I did do that.

915
00:34:01,020 --> 00:34:02,900
Well, I understand why.

916
00:34:02,900 --> 00:34:05,060
Because they're made from super soft materials

917
00:34:05,060 --> 00:34:09,700
like merino wool, pima cotton, and even cashmere,

918
00:34:09,700 --> 00:34:11,940
which makes them the perfect cozy layers.

919
00:34:11,940 --> 00:34:13,580
Duh-nuh-nuh.

920
00:34:13,580 --> 00:34:15,780
And- Wait, what did you guys sing?

921
00:34:15,780 --> 00:34:18,060
No, Justin got me the immigrant song.

922
00:34:18,060 --> 00:34:19,940
Yeah, you guys did definitely do immigrant song.

923
00:34:19,940 --> 00:34:21,420
But it was just Justin did it first.

924
00:34:21,420 --> 00:34:25,820
Duh-nuh-nuh-nuh-nuh-nuh-nuh-nuh-nuh-nuh-nuh-nuh.

925
00:34:25,820 --> 00:34:26,660
Come with me.

926
00:34:26,660 --> 00:34:30,780
Duh-nuh-nuh-nuh-nuh-nuh-nuh-nuh-nuh-nuh-nuh-nuh-nuh-nuh-nuh-nuh-nuh.

927
00:34:30,780 --> 00:34:33,100
Thank you Godzilla soundtrack and puffy that.

928
00:34:33,100 --> 00:34:34,180
Come with me.

929
00:34:34,180 --> 00:34:35,060
Duh-nuh-nuh-nuh-nuh-nuh-nuh-nuh-nuh.

930
00:34:35,060 --> 00:34:37,980
Okay, Bombas underwear has a barely there feel

931
00:34:37,980 --> 00:34:40,380
with second skin support that might make you forget

932
00:34:40,380 --> 00:34:42,780
they're even there in a good way.

933
00:34:42,780 --> 00:34:44,140
And Bombas knows the shelters

934
00:34:44,140 --> 00:34:45,660
for people experiencing homelessness,

935
00:34:45,660 --> 00:34:49,660

Are you ready to binge watch something old?

944
00:35:18,940 --> 00:35:22,340
The Greatest Generation is a podcast about Star Trek

945
00:35:22,340 --> 00:35:24,860
by a couple of hosts a little bit embarrassed

946
00:35:24,860 --> 00:35:27,380
to even have a Star Trek podcast.

947
00:35:27,380 --> 00:35:29,540
Hosted by me, Ben Harrison.

948
00:35:29,540 --> 00:35:31,580
And me, Adam Pranica.

949
00:35:31,580 --> 00:35:33,900
We get into the critical, the technical,

950
00:35:33,900 --> 00:35:37,260
the science fictional aspects of the show we love

951
00:35:37,260 --> 00:35:39,820
while roasting it and each other at the same time.

952
00:35:39,820 --> 00:35:41,540
We've completed an entire series

953
00:35:41,540 --> 00:35:43,820
about Star Trek The Next Generation

954
00:35:43,820 --> 00:35:46,380
and another one about Star Trek Deep Space Nine

955
00:35:46,380 --> 00:35:48,620
and we've just begun Star Trek Voyager.

956
00:35:48,620 --> 00:35:51,020
So now is a great time to start watching

957
00:35:51,020 --> 00:35:53,380
a new Star Trek series with us.

958
00:35:53,380 --> 00:35:55,100
So subscribe to The Greatest Generation

959
00:35:55,100 --> 00:35:58,500

and become a friend of DeSoto today.

961
00:36:01,700 --> 00:36:02,700
How about another question?

962
00:36:02,700 --> 00:36:03,700
Yeah.

963
00:36:03,700 --> 00:36:04,700
Yeah.

964
00:36:04,700 --> 00:36:05,700
I mean, do you not have a thing?

965
00:36:05,700 --> 00:36:06,700
No.

966
00:36:06,700 --> 00:36:07,700
Okay.

967
00:36:07,700 --> 00:36:08,700
Well, then how about we go to the wizard instead?

968
00:36:08,700 --> 00:36:09,700
I'd love that.

969
00:36:09,700 --> 00:36:10,700
Thank you.

970
00:36:10,700 --> 00:36:11,700
Hi, wizard.

971
00:36:11,700 --> 00:36:12,700
Hello.

972
00:36:12,700 --> 00:36:13,700
Oh, God.

973
00:36:13,700 --> 00:36:14,700
Are you okay?

974
00:36:14,700 --> 00:36:15,700
Oh, no.

975
00:36:15,700 --> 00:36:16,700
What happened?

976
00:36:16,700 --> 00:36:17,700
I'm a wizard.

977
00:36:17,700 --> 00:36:18,700
You've never heard my voice before.

978
00:36:18,700 --> 00:36:19,700
Okay.

979
00:36:19,700 --> 00:36:20,700
I'm a wizard.

980
00:36:20,700 --> 00:36:21,700
I'm a wizard.

981
00:36:21,700 --> 00:36:22,700
I'm a wizard.

982
00:36:22,700 --> 00:36:23,700
I'm a wizard.

983
00:36:23,700 --> 00:36:24,700
I'm a wizard.

984
00:36:24,700 --> 00:36:25,700
I'm a wizard.

985
00:36:25,700 --> 00:36:26,700
I'm a wizard.

986
00:36:26,700 --> 00:36:27,700
I'm a wizard.

987
00:36:27,700 --> 00:36:28,700
I'm a wizard.

988
00:36:28,700 --> 00:36:29,700
Are you okay?

989
00:36:29,700 --> 00:36:32,700
I'm like sort of a big dog man.

990
00:36:32,700 --> 00:36:33,700
I love that.

991
00:36:33,700 --> 00:36:34,700
Yeah.

992
00:36:34,700 --> 00:36:36,740
You didn't know he was a big dog man in the sky.

993
00:36:36,740 --> 00:36:37,740
I love it.

994
00:36:37,740 --> 00:36:38,740
Thank you.

995
00:36:38,740 --> 00:36:40,760
This one has an author which fucks me up.

996
00:36:40,760 --> 00:36:43,020
Oh, boy, someone put their name on it.

997
00:36:43,020 --> 00:36:47,420
Yeah, it was co-authored by John Keegan and Ally Rusciano.

998
00:36:47,420 --> 00:36:48,420
So good.

999
00:36:48,420 --> 00:36:50,160
Great work, y'all.

1000
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:52,020
Way to own it.

1001
00:36:52,020 --> 00:36:54,780
So if you have issues with this one, you know who to hit up.

1002
00:36:54,780 --> 00:36:58,220
This one is how to respond to a how was your day text.

1003
00:36:58,220 --> 00:37:00,540
Thank you, Jesus, yes.

1004
00:37:00,540 --> 00:37:02,940
It's actually 14 easy ways to do it.

1005
00:37:02,940 --> 00:37:04,560
And I thought we could go through them pretty quick

1006
00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:08,300
and just kind of rank them by like,

1007
00:37:08,300 --> 00:37:11,140
would you ever actually say these things or not?

1008
00:37:11,140 --> 00:37:13,700
And this is specifically text and not just like

1009
00:37:13,700 --> 00:37:15,820
walking by someone like in a hallway or something, right?

1010
00:37:15,820 --> 00:37:17,220
Yeah, it's nearing the end of the day, Travis,

1011
00:37:17,220 --> 00:37:19,220
and your phone dings into, how was your day?

1012
00:37:19,220 --> 00:37:20,900
Text stares back at you.

1013
00:37:20,900 --> 00:37:22,440
Maybe it's from your best friend, parent,

1014
00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:23,540
or even your crush.

1015
00:37:23,540 --> 00:37:25,500
They just want to check in, but how do you respond?

1016
00:37:25,500 --> 00:37:27,780
If it's your crush, I'm over the moon.

1017
00:37:27,780 --> 00:37:28,740
Are you kidding me?

1018
00:37:28,740 --> 00:37:29,580
Yeah.

1019
00:37:29,580 --> 00:37:33,980
And unprompted, how was your day from my crush?

1020
00:37:33,980 --> 00:37:34,820
Oh, boy.

1021
00:37:34,820 --> 00:37:35,660
Fucking forget it.

1022
00:37:35,660 --> 00:37:37,540
Now my day's amazing.

1023
00:37:37,540 --> 00:37:39,220
Like, are you kidding me?

1024
00:37:39,220 --> 00:37:41,340
I would guess that the answer would be

1025
00:37:41,340 --> 00:37:43,740
sort of context sensitive depending on

1026
00:37:43,740 --> 00:37:47,340
if you got it from your parent or your crush.

1027
00:37:47,340 --> 00:37:48,700
Because I'm gonna say to them,

1028
00:37:48,700 --> 00:37:52,300
well, I've got a great boner now, to one of them.

1029
00:37:52,300 --> 00:37:53,780
Yeah.

1030
00:37:53,780 --> 00:37:55,880
Well, I got a great boner now, dad.

1031
00:37:55,880 --> 00:37:56,980
It's so-

1032
00:37:56,980 --> 00:37:59,500
I'm proud of you, son.

1033
00:37:59,500 --> 00:38:00,660
You've done it.

1034
00:38:00,660 --> 00:38:02,180
Now you're the dad.

1035
00:38:02,180 --> 00:38:05,340
You've overcome our family's curse.

1036
00:38:05,340 --> 00:38:10,340
You finally carried one of the other family up a mountain

1037
00:38:13,340 --> 00:38:15,120
and ate the stinky vegetables,

1038
00:38:15,120 --> 00:38:17,300
and now you can have the bonus.

1039
00:38:17,300 --> 00:38:18,140
It's-

1040
00:38:18,140 --> 00:38:18,960
It's true.

1041
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:20,260
Noodle-limping to the second.

1042
00:38:20,260 --> 00:38:23,800
I've never been more proud of you than I am today.

1043
00:38:24,620 --> 00:38:25,460
So-

1044
00:38:25,460 --> 00:38:27,760
We're going to start calling you Rock Hardson.

1045
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:32,740
All right.

1046
00:38:32,740 --> 00:38:33,780
Number one, it's been great.

1047
00:38:33,780 --> 00:38:34,700
How about you?

1048
00:38:34,700 --> 00:38:36,500
Share how awesome your day's been with this text.

1049
00:38:36,500 --> 00:38:38,180
There's no shame in having a great day.

1050
00:38:38,180 --> 00:38:39,660
Let them know how amazing you feel.

1051
00:38:39,660 --> 00:38:40,940
A fucking great day.

1052
00:38:40,940 --> 00:38:41,780
Great day.

1053
00:38:41,780 --> 00:38:42,820
I forgot that it's okay to do

1054
00:38:42,820 --> 00:38:44,660
because it's been so long since I've had one.

1055
00:38:44,660 --> 00:38:45,500
Right, yeah.

1056
00:38:45,500 --> 00:38:47,420
Well, but I would go the other way,

1057
00:38:47,420 --> 00:38:49,340
which is like, it's a little braggadocious.

1058
00:38:49,340 --> 00:38:51,060
This would be like, fucking awesome.

1059
00:38:51,060 --> 00:38:53,260
The odds of two people communicating with each other,

1060
00:38:53,260 --> 00:38:54,100
having a good day,

1061
00:38:54,100 --> 00:38:55,660
simultaneously right now, impossible.

1062
00:38:55,660 --> 00:38:57,660
Nobody reaches out to somebody else

1063
00:38:57,660 --> 00:39:01,580
because they're having a good time in this day and age.

1064
00:39:01,580 --> 00:39:04,660
If you say that it is good in any way

1065
00:39:04,660 --> 00:39:07,620
and do not follow that up with all things considered,

1066
00:39:07,620 --> 00:39:09,140
you're fucking lying.

1067
00:39:09,140 --> 00:39:10,580
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1068
00:39:10,580 --> 00:39:13,300
Okay, chilled at home, so not too bad.

1069
00:39:13,300 --> 00:39:14,140
Sorry, what?

1070
00:39:14,140 --> 00:39:15,060
Chilled at home?

1071
00:39:15,060 --> 00:39:16,220
Chilled at home.

1072
00:39:16,220 --> 00:39:17,060
Chilled.

1073
00:39:17,060 --> 00:39:18,980
Chilled makes more sense than killed.

1074
00:39:18,980 --> 00:39:21,060
Chilled at home, so not too bad.

1075
00:39:21,060 --> 00:39:22,300
Tell them what you've been up to with this reply.

1076
00:39:22,300 --> 00:39:24,220
Even if all you did today was chill out on the couch,

1077
00:39:24,220 --> 00:39:26,220
fill them in with the deets.

1078
00:39:26,220 --> 00:39:27,140
Are you still standing?

1079
00:39:27,140 --> 00:39:28,180
Yeah.

1080
00:39:28,180 --> 00:39:30,140
Okay, thank you for your honesty, Travis.

1081
00:39:30,140 --> 00:39:30,980
I appreciate it.

1082
00:39:30,980 --> 00:39:32,420
Well, I go to the gym for my exercise, Justin.

1083
00:39:32,420 --> 00:39:35,140
This is my time for work.

1084
00:39:35,140 --> 00:39:36,820
I know, but when I work, I stand up.

1085
00:39:36,820 --> 00:39:38,780
Well, when I work hard, I play hard, yeah?

1086
00:39:38,780 --> 00:39:40,300
Hey, Travis, if you got time to lean,

1087
00:39:40,300 --> 00:39:41,140
you got time to clean.

1088
00:39:41,140 --> 00:39:42,380
I'm not leaning.

1089
00:39:42,380 --> 00:39:43,580
Okay, if you get time to sit,

1090
00:39:43,580 --> 00:39:45,140
then you got time to clean shit.

1091
00:39:45,140 --> 00:39:47,140
Here, take this Windex and go clean

1092
00:39:47,140 --> 00:39:49,260
while I go and do this comedy.

1093
00:39:49,260 --> 00:39:51,220
Squeak, squeak, squeak, squeak.

1094
00:39:51,220 --> 00:39:52,260
I'm an older brother.

1095
00:39:52,260 --> 00:39:54,060
I'm gonna start managing this show better.

1096
00:39:54,060 --> 00:39:56,300
Okay, I'm gonna do what I always do at jobs,

1097
00:39:56,300 --> 00:39:58,940
which is go around the corner and then stop.

1098
00:39:58,940 --> 00:40:00,860
And that energy juice, I think we all know

1099
00:40:00,860 --> 00:40:02,180
from the retail jobs we've worked,

1100
00:40:02,180 --> 00:40:06,060
is the most effective way to get somebody to be effective.

1101
00:40:06,060 --> 00:40:09,220
And it makes for a fun experience that everyone enjoys.

1102
00:40:09,220 --> 00:40:10,100
Fun experience.

1103
00:40:10,100 --> 00:40:11,420
I had to learn to podcast

1104
00:40:11,420 --> 00:40:12,740
just so I would never be in that situation.

1105
00:40:12,740 --> 00:40:15,500
Yeah, so once my manager, Jimmy Johns,

1106
00:40:15,500 --> 00:40:17,940
made me shave in the Jimmy John's bathroom

1107
00:40:17,940 --> 00:40:19,940
with a rusty razor and lukewarm water,

1108
00:40:19,940 --> 00:40:22,700
I said, time to get into podcasting, I think.

1109
00:40:23,940 --> 00:40:25,420
Hey, listen, I love hunting elephants

1110
00:40:25,420 --> 00:40:26,460
as much as the next guy.

1111
00:40:26,460 --> 00:40:30,540
But this has gone too far.

1112
00:40:30,540 --> 00:40:31,380
All right.

1113
00:40:32,540 --> 00:40:33,620
I'm taking these pickles with me.

1114
00:40:33,620 --> 00:40:38,100
The only thing I wanna poach from now on is eggs, Jimmy.

1115
00:40:38,100 --> 00:40:40,420
I don't think they put poached eggs on Jimmy John's sandwich.

1116
00:40:40,420 --> 00:40:42,020
No, that's why I had to quit.

1117
00:40:42,020 --> 00:40:42,980
That's why I had to quit,

1118
00:40:42,980 --> 00:40:44,340
because I tried to put poached eggs,

1119
00:40:44,340 --> 00:40:46,540
and Jimmy said, we only poach elephants.

1120
00:40:46,540 --> 00:40:48,060
Right, yes, that's what-

1121
00:40:48,060 --> 00:40:50,420
This is our new sandwich, The Fruity Little Wuss.

1122
00:40:50,420 --> 00:40:51,860
Okay.

1123
00:40:51,860 --> 00:40:53,980
It's got poached eggs on it.

1124
00:40:53,980 --> 00:40:55,380
He says it's good for protein.

1125
00:40:55,380 --> 00:40:57,260
I just like elephant steaks.

1126
00:40:58,540 --> 00:41:02,220
The trunk is so subtle, you don't even know, man.

1127
00:41:02,220 --> 00:41:04,300
Okay, really good, really good.

1128
00:41:04,300 --> 00:41:05,460
Thanks for asking.

1129
00:41:06,420 --> 00:41:07,260
Really good?

1130
00:41:07,260 --> 00:41:08,860
No, that's sarcastic.

1131
00:41:08,860 --> 00:41:10,220
Really good.

1132
00:41:10,220 --> 00:41:13,900
Thanks for asking.

1133
00:41:13,900 --> 00:41:15,380
That's really good.

1134
00:41:15,380 --> 00:41:17,060
Really good, man.

1135
00:41:17,060 --> 00:41:19,180
Glad you made me think about it.

1136
00:41:19,180 --> 00:41:21,260
Similar vein, good, how was yours?

1137
00:41:21,260 --> 00:41:22,100
Good.

1138
00:41:22,100 --> 00:41:25,100
There's a lot of use of smiling and laughing emojis,

1139
00:41:25,100 --> 00:41:25,940
and a lot of like-

1140
00:41:25,940 --> 00:41:26,780
Can't really communicate that.

1141
00:41:26,780 --> 00:41:29,220
Can't wait for finals to be over, ha ha.

1142
00:41:29,220 --> 00:41:33,180
Good, how was yours, by the way, is so clear.

1143
00:41:33,180 --> 00:41:38,020
One, I'm either gonna read that as a lie, right?

1144
00:41:38,020 --> 00:41:39,260
Or I'm going to read it as,

1145
00:41:39,260 --> 00:41:42,340
oh fuck, they're really annoyed I asked.

1146
00:41:42,340 --> 00:41:43,420
Good, how was yours?

1147
00:41:43,420 --> 00:41:46,100
Right, like you responded with as few,

1148
00:41:46,100 --> 00:41:49,100
not just words, but letters as possible.

1149
00:41:49,100 --> 00:41:53,020
Yeah, if you guys ever get this text back from me,

1150
00:41:53,020 --> 00:41:54,700
it means I have been killed,

1151
00:41:54,700 --> 00:41:57,780
and the killer is using my phone to create an alibi.

1152
00:41:57,780 --> 00:42:00,580
Pretty good, you won't believe what happened.

1153
00:42:00,580 --> 00:42:03,140
If I ever say that to you without saying,

1154
00:42:04,180 --> 00:42:06,860
you know, someone stole my catalytic converter,

1155
00:42:06,860 --> 00:42:09,220
I don't know why I would say that's a pretty good day,

1156
00:42:09,220 --> 00:42:11,060
but if I say, you won't believe

1157
00:42:11,060 --> 00:42:12,660
what happened to me today, guys.

1158
00:42:12,660 --> 00:42:14,820
And I know how you guys are anxious

1159
00:42:14,820 --> 00:42:18,020
in the way that you are, and I am, and we all are.

1160
00:42:18,020 --> 00:42:22,180
That's not me saying that, that is my neighbor,

1161
00:42:22,180 --> 00:42:24,940
or most murders are done by people.

1162
00:42:24,940 --> 00:42:27,700
You, Griffin McElroy, would know never to text us like,

1163
00:42:27,700 --> 00:42:30,420
do you have a second to talk, right?

1164
00:42:30,420 --> 00:42:33,740
Hey guys, got an important conversation

1165
00:42:33,740 --> 00:42:36,100
you're not gonna like.

1166
00:42:36,100 --> 00:42:38,020
And then not respond to our response.

1167
00:42:38,020 --> 00:42:40,180
Don't respond forever.

1168
00:42:40,180 --> 00:42:42,420
Okay, okay, what about you?

1169
00:42:42,420 --> 00:42:44,020
So just a lot of just like,

1170
00:42:45,820 --> 00:42:48,300
here's the quality of my day, and now I'm gonna hit you up.

1171
00:42:48,300 --> 00:42:51,340
This article feels like different ways

1172
00:42:51,340 --> 00:42:53,420
of different days you could be happy.

1173
00:42:53,420 --> 00:42:56,420
Is there an option on there that's like, fucking suck, dude?

1174
00:42:57,620 --> 00:42:59,140
Yeah, Trav, I don't know if you've noticed,

1175
00:42:59,140 --> 00:43:01,260
there's a pattern, these are decreasing.

1176
00:43:01,260 --> 00:43:03,100
Oh, excellent.

1177
00:43:03,100 --> 00:43:04,380
Is there one on there that's like,

1178
00:43:04,380 --> 00:43:05,900
hey, this feels superficial.

1179
00:43:05,900 --> 00:43:07,500
Do you really wanna get into it, man?

1180
00:43:07,500 --> 00:43:09,180
Cause I'll open up my heart to you, bro.

1181
00:43:09,180 --> 00:43:14,180
No, but there is the raw, powerful ennui

1182
00:43:14,260 --> 00:43:16,900
of same old, same old, how was yours?

1183
00:43:16,900 --> 00:43:19,260
Yes. I see, I see.

1184
00:43:19,260 --> 00:43:23,740
Big case of the Mondays, Brock.

1185
00:43:23,740 --> 00:43:24,580
How about you?

1186
00:43:24,580 --> 00:43:27,180
I think, actually, I'm gonna say

1187
00:43:27,180 --> 00:43:29,700
that if you ask someone how was their day,

1188
00:43:29,700 --> 00:43:32,820
I would rather hear someone say it fucking sucked

1189
00:43:32,820 --> 00:43:34,980
than same old, same old.

1190
00:43:34,980 --> 00:43:37,860
Cause there's a certain amount of acceptance

1191
00:43:37,860 --> 00:43:40,820
and same old, same old, it's like, whoa, okay, hey, man.

1192
00:43:40,820 --> 00:43:44,140
Bad, but in a way I'm used to, how about you?

1193
00:43:44,140 --> 00:43:46,780
Let's get out of here and try something,

1194
00:43:46,780 --> 00:43:49,060
let's go horseback riding or something.

1195
00:43:49,060 --> 00:43:49,900
Yeah.

1196
00:43:51,220 --> 00:43:54,260
Okay, so the next one is awesome, fine.

1197
00:43:54,260 --> 00:43:56,140
Give this reply if you don't wanna talk.

1198
00:43:56,140 --> 00:43:57,300
Yeah. Maybe your ex or a friend

1199
00:43:57,300 --> 00:43:58,900
you recently had a falling out with texted you.

1200
00:43:58,900 --> 00:44:00,540
A one word response is a blunt way of saying,

1201
00:44:00,540 --> 00:44:02,500
I don't wanna talk right now.

1202
00:44:02,500 --> 00:44:04,540
No, you know what's an even blunter way?

1203
00:44:04,540 --> 00:44:06,060
Don't respond.

1204
00:44:06,060 --> 00:44:07,820
Don't wanna talk to you right now.

1205
00:44:08,820 --> 00:44:09,660
Not so great.

1206
00:44:10,620 --> 00:44:11,980
If it's your mom or best friend,

1207
00:44:11,980 --> 00:44:13,180
open up and tell the truth.

1208
00:44:13,180 --> 00:44:14,020
Not so great.

1209
00:44:14,020 --> 00:44:14,980
Let me confide in you.

1210
00:44:14,980 --> 00:44:15,860
Is this mom?

1211
00:44:15,860 --> 00:44:18,620
Hey, does you block my number, mom?

1212
00:44:19,940 --> 00:44:20,780
That's okay.

1213
00:44:20,780 --> 00:44:21,900
It's been better.

1214
00:44:21,900 --> 00:44:23,820
This next one is for horny.

1215
00:44:23,820 --> 00:44:26,140
It was okay, seeing you would have made it better.

1216
00:44:26,140 --> 00:44:26,980
Oh.

1217
00:44:28,620 --> 00:44:30,060
Real smooth.

1218
00:44:30,060 --> 00:44:30,900
What do you mean?

1219
00:44:30,900 --> 00:44:32,780
Like seeing all of you would have made it better.

1220
00:44:32,780 --> 00:44:35,540
Watch out Peter Dinklage, there's a new Cyrano in town.

1221
00:44:35,540 --> 00:44:36,900
Oh, hey, nice.

1222
00:44:36,900 --> 00:44:39,380
They should make a modern remake of Cyrano

1223
00:44:39,380 --> 00:44:43,020
where it's just about like sexy texties.

1224
00:44:44,100 --> 00:44:45,620
I'm pretty sure that's in Roxanne.

1225
00:44:45,620 --> 00:44:47,380
I think he's just constantly sending sexy texts.

1226
00:44:47,380 --> 00:44:49,620
They send sexy texties in Roxanne?

1227
00:44:49,620 --> 00:44:52,220
Yeah, he's just sexting constantly.

1228
00:44:52,220 --> 00:44:54,700
Guys, sexy texties is something.

1229
00:44:54,700 --> 00:44:55,780
There's something powerful about

1230
00:44:55,780 --> 00:44:58,100
not saying the second T in the word text.

1231
00:44:59,060 --> 00:45:00,060
Sexy texties.

1232
00:45:00,060 --> 00:45:01,380
This is a great reply for someone

1233
00:45:01,380 --> 00:45:03,140
you haven't seen in a while.

1234
00:45:03,140 --> 00:45:05,020
Maybe you haven't seen their butt in a while.

1235
00:45:05,020 --> 00:45:06,540
To be fair, that is a good point though.

1236
00:45:06,540 --> 00:45:09,260
So that doesn't work if you did see them.

1237
00:45:09,260 --> 00:45:11,660
Seeing you would have, I just left.

1238
00:45:11,660 --> 00:45:13,860
The arc of this article is so great

1239
00:45:13,860 --> 00:45:16,020
because it's like at the top of it,

1240
00:45:16,020 --> 00:45:17,740
it's like brag about how cool your life is

1241
00:45:17,740 --> 00:45:19,140
and how shitty their life is.

1242
00:45:19,140 --> 00:45:22,220
All the way down to like cry for help

1243
00:45:22,220 --> 00:45:25,740
because you are so sad about the non-changing nature

1244
00:45:25,740 --> 00:45:28,020
of your life and how you feel like you're stuck

1245
00:45:28,020 --> 00:45:29,940
in a sort of existential quagmire.

1246
00:45:29,940 --> 00:45:32,180
And then it's like, get a little horny.

1247
00:45:32,180 --> 00:45:34,180
And the next one is any day is great

1248
00:45:34,180 --> 00:45:37,460
when you text me, get that dick out now.

1249
00:45:37,460 --> 00:45:39,220
Let's go.

1250
00:45:39,220 --> 00:45:41,420
I was sad before, but I changed it

1251
00:45:41,420 --> 00:45:43,020
with a different feeling.

1252
00:45:44,180 --> 00:45:45,820
That's the one I text back when I get them

1253
00:45:45,820 --> 00:45:48,060
from Bernie Sanders, definitely real.

1254
00:45:48,060 --> 00:45:48,900
Bernie Sanders.

1255
00:45:48,900 --> 00:45:49,740
Hey, it's Bernie.

1256
00:45:49,740 --> 00:45:50,740
Burn.

1257
00:45:50,740 --> 00:45:51,580
Burn?

1258
00:45:52,620 --> 00:45:54,940
You wanna go see the Batman or what?

1259
00:45:54,940 --> 00:45:55,780
Burn?

1260
00:45:55,780 --> 00:45:57,620
We're still on for tonight?

1261
00:45:57,620 --> 00:45:58,620
All right, all right, we'll see.

1262
00:45:58,620 --> 00:46:00,500
Murder on the Nile, geez.

1263
00:46:00,500 --> 00:46:01,340
Feeling better now.

1264
00:46:01,340 --> 00:46:03,300
I love having old friends.

1265
00:46:03,300 --> 00:46:05,660
Yeah, we can go to, we'll go to the 5 p.m. show.

1266
00:46:05,660 --> 00:46:07,780
We'll go to 5 p.m. man, you gotta get to bed.

1267
00:46:07,780 --> 00:46:09,060
Sounds great, my dude, that works for me.

1268
00:46:09,060 --> 00:46:11,060
Hey, bring those mittens I ordered from your shop.

1269
00:46:11,060 --> 00:46:12,700
Yeah, we can sneak in candy, Bernie.

1270
00:46:12,700 --> 00:46:15,180
It has gotten too expensive lately.

1271
00:46:15,180 --> 00:46:18,060
Yeah, sorry they don't have Mary James.

1272
00:46:18,060 --> 00:46:20,620
I bet we can sneak in some Bitto Hunnies.

1273
00:46:20,620 --> 00:46:24,260
We'll sneak in some Bitto Hunnies, you old bird.

1274
00:46:24,260 --> 00:46:25,660
You old sneak.

1275
00:46:25,660 --> 00:46:26,500
Hound dog.

1276
00:46:27,620 --> 00:46:29,700
Oh, you scoundrel, are those good and plenty?

1277
00:46:29,700 --> 00:46:30,540
Get out of here.

1278
00:46:30,540 --> 00:46:32,340
What's a good place, you old hound dog?

1279
00:46:32,340 --> 00:46:33,660
Careful, that box is real loud.

1280
00:46:33,660 --> 00:46:35,300
Oh, you put them in a Ziploc bag.

1281
00:46:35,300 --> 00:46:37,220
That's gonna fix that right up.

1282
00:46:37,220 --> 00:46:39,060
You're right, this one would be better

1283
00:46:39,060 --> 00:46:40,100
with Marlene Dietrich.

1284
00:46:40,100 --> 00:46:40,940
You're right.

1285
00:46:40,940 --> 00:46:42,580
We're all having a lot of fun.

1286
00:46:42,580 --> 00:46:44,940
We're all having a lot of fun here

1287
00:46:44,940 --> 00:46:49,060
at Mr. Sanders' expense, but feeling better.

1288
00:46:49,060 --> 00:46:51,740
Well, he should stop texting, that's all.

1289
00:46:51,740 --> 00:46:53,020
Feeling better now, thanks for checking in.

1290
00:46:53,020 --> 00:46:53,860
That one's not funny.

1291
00:46:53,860 --> 00:46:54,980
This next one is pretty good though.

1292
00:46:54,980 --> 00:46:56,940
A mess, but we live and learn.

1293
00:46:56,940 --> 00:46:57,900
Whoa.

1294
00:46:57,900 --> 00:46:58,720
Whoa.

1295
00:46:58,720 --> 00:47:01,780
That is a store, somebody murdered somebody.

1296
00:47:01,780 --> 00:47:03,060
Yeah, that's like growth.

1297
00:47:03,060 --> 00:47:03,900
We live and learn.

1298
00:47:03,900 --> 00:47:04,720
I'm murdered.

1299
00:47:04,720 --> 00:47:05,560
A mess?

1300
00:47:05,560 --> 00:47:07,500
If you describe your day as a mess,

1301
00:47:07,500 --> 00:47:08,980
you should be brought up on charge.

1302
00:47:08,980 --> 00:47:11,980
I'm betting vehicular manslaughter is my guess.

1303
00:47:11,980 --> 00:47:14,340
Hit someone with a car, won't do that again.

1304
00:47:14,340 --> 00:47:15,700
Live and learn.

1305
00:47:15,700 --> 00:47:18,260
Wait, killed someone with a big, fast automobile,

1306
00:47:18,260 --> 00:47:20,540
didn't like it, won't do it again.

1307
00:47:20,540 --> 00:47:22,260
Do not recommend.

1308
00:47:22,260 --> 00:47:24,020
Would love to see you though.

1309
00:47:24,020 --> 00:47:26,100
Would've been better if I hit you with my dick.

1310
00:47:26,100 --> 00:47:28,580
Wait, hold on, no, jump back, jump back.

1311
00:47:28,580 --> 00:47:30,580
I was happy and then I was sad, then I got horny,

1312
00:47:30,580 --> 00:47:31,900
then I hit someone with my car

1313
00:47:31,900 --> 00:47:35,100
and now I'm just sort of focusing on me and my journey.

1314
00:47:36,420 --> 00:47:39,140
It turns out I'm super horny again.

1315
00:47:39,140 --> 00:47:41,520
Yeah, it turns out it made me even hornier.

1316
00:47:41,520 --> 00:47:43,720
Now, this is the last one and it's like,

1317
00:47:44,760 --> 00:47:47,060
this one you should actually expect to get from me

1318
00:47:47,060 --> 00:47:47,900
at some point.

1319
00:47:47,900 --> 00:47:49,780
You say, Griffin, how was your day?

1320
00:47:49,780 --> 00:47:50,700
Very productive.

1321
00:47:54,580 --> 00:47:57,300
Very, very productive, eventful.

1322
00:47:57,300 --> 00:47:58,900
The team made lots of progress

1323
00:47:58,900 --> 00:48:01,540
and I'll make sure to have that data to you by midnight.

1324
00:48:01,540 --> 00:48:03,820
That's one of the suggested response.

1325
00:48:03,820 --> 00:48:06,460
Is that a e-how person trying to figure out

1326
00:48:06,460 --> 00:48:07,620
how jobs work?

1327
00:48:07,620 --> 00:48:08,980
Good, and the meeting went well.

1328
00:48:08,980 --> 00:48:11,620
I think our proposal has a shot, smiley face.

1329
00:48:11,620 --> 00:48:15,420
This one feels fairly specific, yeah.

1330
00:48:15,420 --> 00:48:17,300
Can't wait to work more.

1331
00:48:17,300 --> 00:48:20,740
Can't wait to work more, love work, love doing it.

1332
00:48:20,740 --> 00:48:24,940
Would love to see that butthole on a text message though.

1333
00:48:24,940 --> 00:48:28,140
Oh, sorry, sorry, I thought you were my boss.

1334
00:48:28,140 --> 00:48:29,220
I didn't realize.

1335
00:48:29,220 --> 00:48:30,060
Whoops.

1336
00:48:31,660 --> 00:48:33,860
I knew he was there somewhere.

1337
00:48:33,860 --> 00:48:36,460
I was trying to be polite and keep up the vibe.

1338
00:48:36,460 --> 00:48:37,740
Yeah, man, for sure.

1339
00:48:38,900 --> 00:48:42,880
Diga, diga, diga, diga, diga, diga, diga, diga, diga, diga,

1340
00:48:42,880 --> 00:48:43,880
do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do.

1341
00:48:43,880 --> 00:48:44,720
Oh, wow.

1342
00:48:44,720 --> 00:48:49,120
Do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do.

1343
00:48:49,120 --> 00:48:51,660
I want a munch squad.

1344
00:48:51,660 --> 00:48:53,420
Ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba.

1345
00:48:53,420 --> 00:48:56,700
I want to munch squad.

1346
00:48:56,700 --> 00:48:59,660
Ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba.

1347
00:48:59,660 --> 00:49:00,820
Welcome to Munch Squad.

1348
00:49:00,820 --> 00:49:02,900
It's a podcast within a podcast

1349
00:49:02,900 --> 00:49:06,800
profiling the latest and greatest in brand eating.

1350
00:49:06,800 --> 00:49:09,420
And me, just a macaron.

1351
00:49:09,420 --> 00:49:14,420
I'm ready to get loud and wild with Mountain Dew.

1352
00:49:15,020 --> 00:49:15,860
Oh boy.

1353
00:49:17,860 --> 00:49:19,420
Mountain Dew is going to thrill sports fans

1354
00:49:19,420 --> 00:49:22,540
at Buffalo Wild Wings with the exclusive new pour,

1355
00:49:22,540 --> 00:49:23,380
Mountain Dew Legend.

1356
00:49:23,380 --> 00:49:24,220
Yeah.

1357
00:49:24,220 --> 00:49:25,060
Whoa, shit.

1358
00:49:25,060 --> 00:49:27,020
This new offering delivers a bold burst

1359
00:49:27,020 --> 00:49:31,660
of blackberry flavor that is, wait for it, legendary.

1360
00:49:31,660 --> 00:49:33,100
That's not how you do it.

1361
00:49:34,940 --> 00:49:37,620
Yeah, they messed up that great

1362
00:49:37,620 --> 00:49:39,100
how I met your mother reference.

1363
00:49:39,100 --> 00:49:40,300
That's not how you do it.

1364
00:49:40,300 --> 00:49:43,700
You messed up the how I met your mother reference, PepsiCo.

1365
00:49:43,700 --> 00:49:46,420
So Mountain Dew and Buffalo Wild Wings

1366
00:49:46,420 --> 00:49:48,380
are bringing sports fans a reason to celebrate.

1367
00:49:48,380 --> 00:49:49,220
Finally.

1368
00:49:49,220 --> 00:49:52,700
By recruiting an all new exclusive.

1369
00:49:52,700 --> 00:49:54,020
Don't say recruiting.

1370
00:49:54,020 --> 00:49:55,380
I know what you're going for.

1371
00:49:55,380 --> 00:49:56,860
Trying to make a sporty thing.

1372
00:49:56,860 --> 00:49:58,580
But it makes it sound like on the street,

1373
00:49:58,580 --> 00:50:02,420
you saw a soda and said, give me that kid.

1374
00:50:02,420 --> 00:50:03,300
Hey, soda.

1375
00:50:03,300 --> 00:50:04,240
Yeah, you.

1376
00:50:04,240 --> 00:50:06,540
You ever dreamed about being in the big leagues?

1377
00:50:07,960 --> 00:50:12,060
So this soda is soon to be legendary, it says,

1378
00:50:13,060 --> 00:50:14,620
even though they're only offering

1379
00:50:14,620 --> 00:50:16,620
exclusive Buffalo Wild Wings.

1380
00:50:16,620 --> 00:50:18,660
I guess they're leaving the legend some room

1381
00:50:18,660 --> 00:50:21,260
to expand on it so it's sort of simmer.

1382
00:50:21,260 --> 00:50:23,180
You don't want to come out the gate too strong

1383
00:50:23,180 --> 00:50:24,780
and shove the legend down people's throats

1384
00:50:24,780 --> 00:50:27,500
by saying this is a legend, right?

1385
00:50:27,500 --> 00:50:29,660
They should have called it Mountain Dew.

1386
00:50:29,660 --> 00:50:32,380
And then let it grow on its own.

1387
00:50:32,380 --> 00:50:33,820
Let it be its own thing.

1388
00:50:33,820 --> 00:50:38,080
This sentence is like maybe one of the worst ones.

1389
00:50:38,080 --> 00:50:38,920
Ever?

1390
00:50:40,220 --> 00:50:43,780
There's not a sentence after that.

1391
00:50:43,780 --> 00:50:45,780
Like this sentence I'm about to read

1392
00:50:45,780 --> 00:50:47,580
is one of the worst ones.

1393
00:50:47,580 --> 00:50:48,420
Okay.

1394
00:50:49,260 --> 00:50:51,860
Curated for those who embrace the fun

1395
00:50:51,860 --> 00:50:53,740
and freedom in life.

1396
00:50:53,740 --> 00:50:55,580
This standout, that's already-

1397
00:50:55,580 --> 00:50:56,420
Yeah.

1398
00:50:56,420 --> 00:50:57,260
Fuck yeah.

1399
00:50:57,260 --> 00:50:58,080
What?

1400
00:50:58,080 --> 00:50:58,920
Awesome.

1401
00:50:58,920 --> 00:50:59,760
What are you saying?

1402
00:50:59,760 --> 00:51:00,600
That's me.

1403
00:51:00,600 --> 00:51:02,100
I love fun and freedom.

1404
00:51:02,100 --> 00:51:03,740
Do you mean made from a syrup in an-

1405
00:51:03,740 --> 00:51:05,500
No, Justin, no.

1406
00:51:05,500 --> 00:51:09,060
Every bottle is made by a professional mixologist

1407
00:51:10,180 --> 00:51:11,500
in suspenders.

1408
00:51:11,500 --> 00:51:16,500
This standout beverage combines the exhilarating taste

1409
00:51:16,960 --> 00:51:18,980
of original Mountain Dew.

1410
00:51:18,980 --> 00:51:20,540
Whoa, what's this?

1411
00:51:20,540 --> 00:51:22,360
I'm still alive.

1412
00:51:22,360 --> 00:51:24,440
For the very first time.

1413
00:51:25,440 --> 00:51:30,440
Original Mountain Dew, M-T-N capital, D-E-W, Mountain Dew,

1414
00:51:30,780 --> 00:51:35,060
with notes of blackberry, citrus, and ginger.

1415
00:51:35,060 --> 00:51:35,900
Okay.

1416
00:51:35,900 --> 00:51:38,620
With its bold charge and refreshing taste,

1417
00:51:38,620 --> 00:51:41,420
Mountain Dew legend is uniquely designed

1418
00:51:41,420 --> 00:51:45,660
to elevate Buffalo Wild Wings sauces, burgers,

1419
00:51:45,660 --> 00:51:46,980
and other bar food items.

1420
00:51:46,980 --> 00:51:49,140
Now you can't just make that blanket statement.

1421
00:51:49,140 --> 00:51:49,980
There's so many different-

1422
00:51:49,980 --> 00:51:50,800
They have, they have.

1423
00:51:50,800 --> 00:51:51,640
There's a lot of different-

1424
00:51:51,640 --> 00:51:53,260
It's formulated to elevate all food offerings.

1425
00:51:53,260 --> 00:51:56,460
There's so many sauces and dry rub.

1426
00:51:56,460 --> 00:52:00,540
It pairs perfectly with frickels.

1427
00:52:00,540 --> 00:52:04,460
You can't tell me it's great for like the garlic zing

1428
00:52:04,460 --> 00:52:06,540
and the fucking Cajun dry rub.

1429
00:52:06,540 --> 00:52:08,040
It's not the flavor, Travis.

1430
00:52:08,040 --> 00:52:10,660
It's that it pairs well with the bones.

1431
00:52:10,660 --> 00:52:11,500
Oh, okay.

1432
00:52:11,500 --> 00:52:13,940
The Mountain Dew pairs good with the bones.

1433
00:52:13,940 --> 00:52:15,660
Just pop your bones in there when you're done,

1434
00:52:15,660 --> 00:52:17,260
it'll dissolve them all up.

1435
00:52:17,260 --> 00:52:18,100
Make a broth.

1436
00:52:18,100 --> 00:52:21,020
This makes the fan favorite sports bars

1437
00:52:21,020 --> 00:52:23,660
the best place for sports enthusiasts

1438
00:52:23,660 --> 00:52:25,900
to enjoy great food and drinks,

1439
00:52:25,900 --> 00:52:28,780
all while watching their favorite matchups

1440
00:52:28,780 --> 00:52:30,620
on the big screen.

1441
00:52:30,620 --> 00:52:31,940
Yeah.

1442
00:52:31,940 --> 00:52:32,780
Yeah, that-

1443
00:52:32,780 --> 00:52:33,600
This is what sports people like, right?

1444
00:52:33,600 --> 00:52:35,500
Do they still offer trivia?

1445
00:52:35,500 --> 00:52:36,340
Do they still do the-

1446
00:52:36,340 --> 00:52:37,160
I don't know if they do anymore.

1447
00:52:37,160 --> 00:52:38,000
I want to do the trivia game.

1448
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:38,840
That's my favorite sport.

1449
00:52:38,840 --> 00:52:40,260
They used to do it.

1450
00:52:40,260 --> 00:52:41,900
We used to have a very small B2B place.

1451
00:52:41,900 --> 00:52:42,740
Oh yeah, shoebox.

1452
00:52:42,740 --> 00:52:43,820
Now we have a very big one.

1453
00:52:43,820 --> 00:52:44,660
Oh yeah?

1454
00:52:44,660 --> 00:52:45,480
It's weird.

1455
00:52:45,480 --> 00:52:46,320
It grew up.

1456
00:52:46,320 --> 00:52:47,700
Yeah, at the mall.

1457
00:52:47,700 --> 00:52:49,820
Anyway, at Buffalo Wild Wings,

1458
00:52:49,820 --> 00:52:51,860
we strive to provide our guests with mouthwatering-

1459
00:52:51,860 --> 00:52:53,300
Wait, who's this?

1460
00:52:53,300 --> 00:52:54,140
It's just a choice.

1461
00:52:54,140 --> 00:52:56,780
You do not know that that is what their voice sounds like.

1462
00:52:56,780 --> 00:52:57,600
Yes, I do.

1463
00:52:57,600 --> 00:52:58,860
What's the name?

1464
00:52:58,860 --> 00:52:59,860
Rita Patel.

1465
00:53:00,740 --> 00:53:01,860
It's possible.

1466
00:53:01,860 --> 00:53:03,020
Okay.

1467
00:53:03,020 --> 00:53:03,860
Anything's possible.

1468
00:53:03,860 --> 00:53:06,620
She might sound like an old-timey oil magnate, for sure.

1469
00:53:06,620 --> 00:53:09,020
I don't know much about no Buffalo Wild Wings.

1470
00:53:09,020 --> 00:53:11,280
What I do is tea.

1471
00:53:11,280 --> 00:53:13,460
This is the only stage for character work I have.

1472
00:53:13,460 --> 00:53:15,740
It's this and playing dolls with my kids, okay?

1473
00:53:15,740 --> 00:53:18,660
Now, I might be a simple brand ambassador

1474
00:53:18,660 --> 00:53:22,060
from a big company like Coca-Cola-Co,

1475
00:53:22,060 --> 00:53:26,380
but what I know, I know bone flavor.

1476
00:53:26,380 --> 00:53:27,800
And this goes with bone.

1477
00:53:27,800 --> 00:53:29,740
Dip them in there, eat the bones.

1478
00:53:29,740 --> 00:53:30,900
What's that?

1479
00:53:30,900 --> 00:53:32,420
I can't tell them to eat the bones?

1480
00:53:32,420 --> 00:53:35,420
Rita Patel is the chief marketing officer

1481
00:53:35,420 --> 00:53:37,500
of Buffalo Wild Wings.

1482
00:53:37,500 --> 00:53:38,340
The CMO.

1483
00:53:39,420 --> 00:53:40,300
Do you think you'd get in trouble

1484
00:53:40,300 --> 00:53:41,860
if we call your CMO come-o?

1485
00:53:41,860 --> 00:53:45,020
Yes, I do, Justin.

1486
00:53:45,020 --> 00:53:45,860
Probably.

1487
00:53:45,860 --> 00:53:47,460
Yes, I do think you'd get in trouble.

1488
00:53:47,460 --> 00:53:49,140
How was the weekend, come-o?

1489
00:53:49,140 --> 00:53:51,420
I wish you wouldn't.

1490
00:53:51,420 --> 00:53:54,640
I think immediately the HR representative would appear.

1491
00:53:55,860 --> 00:53:57,340
Did you just say the word come-o?

1492
00:53:57,340 --> 00:53:59,780
It's not on our list of words you can't say,

1493
00:53:59,780 --> 00:54:01,960
but it is now.

1494
00:54:01,960 --> 00:54:03,940
What is it to you, her?

1495
00:54:03,940 --> 00:54:06,100
Sorry, it's HR, human resources.

1496
00:54:06,100 --> 00:54:08,100
Oh, that explains so much.

1497
00:54:08,100 --> 00:54:08,940
Yeah.

1498
00:54:08,940 --> 00:54:10,460
Mountain Dew legend.

1499
00:54:10,460 --> 00:54:12,900
Okay, at Buffalo Wild Wings,

1500
00:54:12,900 --> 00:54:15,500
we provide our guests with mouth, water, and flavors

1501
00:54:15,500 --> 00:54:18,220
and exciting innovations across our menu,

1502
00:54:18,220 --> 00:54:20,260
said Rita Patel, chief marketing officer.

1503
00:54:20,260 --> 00:54:21,500
If that's true, Rita,

1504
00:54:21,500 --> 00:54:23,100
why did you get rid of the big pretzel

1505
00:54:23,100 --> 00:54:24,780
and replace it with smaller pretzels

1506
00:54:24,780 --> 00:54:25,620
that aren't as good?

1507
00:54:25,620 --> 00:54:26,940
Thank you.

1508
00:54:26,940 --> 00:54:29,860
Mountain Dew legend is a unique drink

1509
00:54:29,860 --> 00:54:34,100
that we're proud to serve exclusively at our sports bars

1510
00:54:34,100 --> 00:54:35,020
that we have.

1511
00:54:35,020 --> 00:54:38,260
We have a longstanding relationship with PepsiCo,

1512
00:54:38,260 --> 00:54:42,220
and we are known for bringing fans unexpected bold flavors

1513
00:54:42,220 --> 00:54:45,580
like the Doritos spicy sweet chili flavored sauce.

1514
00:54:45,580 --> 00:54:46,420
What?

1515
00:54:46,420 --> 00:54:47,240
I didn't know about this.

1516
00:54:47,240 --> 00:54:48,080
I gotta go.

1517
00:54:48,080 --> 00:54:50,500
The Doritos spicy sweet chili flavored sauce.

1518
00:54:50,500 --> 00:54:52,620
We're thrilled to continue our collaboration

1519
00:54:52,620 --> 00:54:54,820
for one of a kind menu offerings.

1520
00:54:56,100 --> 00:54:58,480
In case you're curious about Pepsi's side of it,

1521
00:54:58,480 --> 00:55:00,060
Scott Finlow, the come-o.

1522
00:55:00,060 --> 00:55:00,900
Pepsi.

1523
00:55:00,900 --> 00:55:01,720
Pepsi.

1524
00:55:01,720 --> 00:55:02,560
Pepsi.

1525
00:55:02,560 --> 00:55:03,400
Pepsi.

1526
00:55:03,400 --> 00:55:04,220
Pepsi.

1527
00:55:04,220 --> 00:55:05,060
Pepsi.

1528
00:55:05,060 --> 00:55:05,900
Pepsi.

1529
00:55:05,900 --> 00:55:06,880
He sounds like this.

1530
00:55:06,880 --> 00:55:08,700
Buffalo Wild Wings and Mountain Dew

1531
00:55:08,700 --> 00:55:12,580
both know a thing or two about passionate fan bases,

1532
00:55:12,580 --> 00:55:15,700
how to take celebrations to the next level

1533
00:55:15,700 --> 00:55:17,940
with great tasting, food, and beverages.

1534
00:55:17,940 --> 00:55:19,060
Okay.

1535
00:55:19,060 --> 00:55:22,620
Together, our goal is to elevate the sports viewing

1536
00:55:22,620 --> 00:55:25,640
and dining experience with Mountain Dew legend,

1537
00:55:25,640 --> 00:55:30,180
serving as the ultimate wingman.

1538
00:55:30,180 --> 00:55:31,840
Oh!

1539
00:55:31,840 --> 00:55:32,680
All right.

1540
00:55:32,680 --> 00:55:33,740
That's good, Scott.

1541
00:55:33,740 --> 00:55:34,580
Good job, Scott.

1542
00:55:34,580 --> 00:55:35,420
That's good.

1543
00:55:35,420 --> 00:55:36,780
Yeah, you did all right with that one, Scott.

1544
00:55:36,780 --> 00:55:40,700
It'll be available at all 1200 Buffalo Wild Wings locations

1545
00:55:40,700 --> 00:55:42,140
by May, 2022.

1546
00:55:42,140 --> 00:55:45,220
Apparently the pipeline is still being constructed.

1547
00:55:45,220 --> 00:55:46,860
So that's a thrill.

1548
00:55:46,860 --> 00:55:48,440
And it's something to get excited about.

1549
00:55:48,440 --> 00:55:51,060
Mountain Dew legend coming.

1550
00:55:51,900 --> 00:55:53,260
So you can't fucking wait.

1551
00:55:53,260 --> 00:55:54,100
Thank you.

1552
00:55:54,100 --> 00:55:54,920
Me neither.

1553
00:55:54,920 --> 00:55:57,580
Hey, thanks for listening to my brother, my brother, and me.

1554
00:55:57,580 --> 00:55:58,740
We hope you had fun.

1555
00:55:58,740 --> 00:55:59,860
I know that we did,

1556
00:55:59,860 --> 00:56:02,020
and I hope you're hanging in there and doing well.

1557
00:56:02,020 --> 00:56:04,340
And we always appreciate you spending an hour with us.

1558
00:56:04,340 --> 00:56:05,500
So thank you for that.

1559
00:56:05,500 --> 00:56:06,340
Sincerely.

1560
00:56:06,340 --> 00:56:07,360
And we have some information

1561
00:56:07,360 --> 00:56:09,580
about the 20 Rendezvous Fancy Takes Flight Tour.

1562
00:56:09,580 --> 00:56:11,540
So due to a scheduling conflict,

1563
00:56:11,540 --> 00:56:14,400
we had to reschedule the Fancy Takes Flight Tour dates

1564
00:56:14,400 --> 00:56:16,140
that were originally set for this month

1565
00:56:16,140 --> 00:56:18,960
in Washington, D.C., Detroit, and Cincinnati.

1566
00:56:18,960 --> 00:56:20,660
They'll now take place in November.

1567
00:56:20,660 --> 00:56:23,980
So the Scentsy MBMB AM will be November 10th.

1568
00:56:23,980 --> 00:56:26,720
The Detroit MBMB AM will be November 11th.

1569
00:56:26,720 --> 00:56:29,500
The D.C. MBMB AM will be November 12th,

1570
00:56:29,500 --> 00:56:32,380
and the D.C. TAZ show will be November 13th.

1571
00:56:32,380 --> 00:56:33,980
All existing tickets will be honored

1572
00:56:33,980 --> 00:56:35,540
for the rescheduled show.

1573
00:56:35,540 --> 00:56:37,540
Refunds will be available at point of purchase

1574
00:56:37,540 --> 00:56:39,260
for those unable to attend the new dates.

1575
00:56:39,260 --> 00:56:40,140
We know it sucks.

1576
00:56:40,140 --> 00:56:41,160
We didn't want to do it.

1577
00:56:41,160 --> 00:56:42,000
We had to,

1578
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:44,500
and we're looking forward to seeing you later in the year.

1579
00:56:44,500 --> 00:56:46,700
Tickets for these shows are on sale now

1580

of event start are required.

1589
00:57:11,620 --> 00:57:13,620
Dad wrote a kid's book called

00:57:13,620 --> 00:57:15,780

1591

00:57:29,220 --> 00:57:30,700
Over at McElroyMerch.com,

1597
00:57:30,700 --> 00:57:32,180
we got the mystery pin of the month,

1598
00:57:32,180 --> 00:57:34,740
which is going to be a random pin of the month

1599
00:57:34,740 --> 00:57:36,220
from the past, which benefits

1600
00:57:36,220 --> 00:57:39,940
the National Asian Pacific American Women's Forum.

1601
00:57:39,940 --> 00:57:43,020
We've got Candle Nights 2021 special video on demand.

1602
00:57:43,020 --> 00:57:44,060
You can pay what you want,

1603
00:57:44,060 --> 00:57:45,700
and all proceeds go to Harmony House.

1604
00:57:45,700 --> 00:57:48,020
You can check that out at McElroyMerch.com.

1605
00:57:48,020 --> 00:57:51,860
Also, I'm going to be hosting a live virtual show

1606
00:57:51,860 --> 00:57:54,660
to benefit two great efforts here in Cincinnati.

1607
00:57:54,660 --> 00:57:56,540
One is called Bethany House,

1608
00:57:56,540 --> 00:57:59,340
which is a shelter that focuses on families

1609
00:57:59,340 --> 00:58:01,100
that are experiencing homelessness

1610
00:58:01,100 --> 00:58:03,780
or at risk of experiencing homelessness.

1611
00:58:03,780 --> 00:58:06,460
And also, we're going to stock some free fridges

1612
00:58:06,460 --> 00:58:09,100
here in Cincinnati and right across the river in Kentucky

1613
00:58:09,100 --> 00:58:11,500
with masks and COVID tests.

1614
00:58:11,500 --> 00:58:13,380
And we're going to have some amazing guests.

1615
00:58:13,380 --> 00:58:14,500
We had to reschedule,

1616
00:58:14,500 --> 00:58:17,140
but we're rescheduling for April 1st.

1617
00:58:17,140 --> 00:58:18,980
Our guests are going to be, let's see,

1618
00:58:18,980 --> 00:58:22,940
we got Adam Brody, got Rob Corddry, got Montane.

1619
00:58:22,940 --> 00:58:24,660
We got Christina Ariel.

1620
00:58:24,660 --> 00:58:26,380
And then there will be two more guests

1621
00:58:26,380 --> 00:58:28,980
that we haven't locked down yet, but it's very exciting.

1622
00:58:28,980 --> 00:58:33,060
Get those tickets at cincyticket.com slash cuscares.

1623

1624
00:58:40,580 --> 00:58:43,660
That show is going to be April 1st at 9 p.m. Eastern time.

1625
00:58:45,020 --> 00:58:45,860
That's it.

1626
00:58:45,860 --> 00:58:46,700
Thank you for listening to all those announcements.

1627
00:58:46,700 --> 00:58:48,660
What if we show up, so am I going to show up

1628
00:58:48,660 --> 00:58:51,500
and then you'd be like, no show, April Fools.

1629
00:58:51,500 --> 00:58:52,980
No, I would never do that.

1630
00:58:52,980 --> 00:58:55,340
And it will be available for two weeks,

1631
00:58:55,340 --> 00:58:56,340
a video on demand afterwards.

1632
00:58:56,340 --> 00:58:58,180
No, it won't, it's an April Fools joke.

1633
00:58:58,180 --> 00:59:00,140
No, don't say that, please. It's not real.

1634
00:59:00,140 --> 00:59:02,980
Please, it benefits really good organizations, Griffin.

1635
00:59:02,980 --> 00:59:07,460
Yeah, sure it does, fake show, joke, fake joke show.

1636
00:59:07,460 --> 00:59:08,900
Thanks to Montane for these for a theme song.

1637
00:59:08,900 --> 00:59:09,900
My life is better with you.

1638
00:59:09,900 --> 00:59:12,700
It's a great track and the music video's on YouTube.

1639
00:59:12,700 --> 00:59:14,140
If you haven't seen that, it's a lot of fun.

1640
00:59:14,140 --> 00:59:15,200
We're in it.

1641
00:59:15,200 --> 00:59:16,940
We're in it, we did it.

1642
00:59:16,940 --> 00:59:20,500
Oh, final bit, I liked doing an impression last week.

1643
00:59:20,500 --> 00:59:22,780
I felt like, cause I got an email

1644
00:59:22,780 --> 00:59:26,260
from the Saturday Night Live guy.

1645
00:59:26,260 --> 00:59:27,220
Oh yeah?

1646
00:59:27,220 --> 00:59:28,060
Wow.

1647
00:59:28,060 --> 00:59:29,100
Yeah.

1648
00:59:29,100 --> 00:59:33,780
And I don't remember his name, but that's okay.

1649
00:59:33,780 --> 00:59:35,700
He said it's okay if I don't remember his name,

1650
00:59:35,700 --> 00:59:37,820
but he was like, great voices.

1651
00:59:37,820 --> 00:59:39,680
What else you got, kid?

1652
00:59:41,060 --> 00:59:43,180
So just like, I guess give me somebody else,

1653
00:59:43,180 --> 00:59:46,900
like a hot, like a name that's like in the news right now.

1654
00:59:46,900 --> 00:59:49,060
Okay, who's like a cool,

1655
00:59:49,060 --> 00:59:52,260
who's like a cool impression that Griffin could do?

1656
00:59:52,260 --> 00:59:54,140
Griffin, could you do Pete Davidson?

1657
00:59:56,460 --> 00:59:57,300
Oh, wait, did you say you want to do it?

1658
00:59:57,300 --> 00:59:58,140
Justin, were you about to do it?

1659
00:59:58,140 --> 00:59:59,340
It sounded like you were about to get a hint.

1660
00:59:59,340 --> 01:00:00,900
No, no, I was like, oh, that's a good choice.

1661
01:00:00,900 --> 01:00:02,580
Oh, it sounded like you were about to be like,

1662
01:00:02,580 --> 01:00:03,900
well, let me see what I can do.

1663
01:00:03,900 --> 01:00:04,840
No, I don't have a beat.

1664
01:00:04,840 --> 01:00:06,340
Go ahead, Griff, let's hear your beat.

1665
01:00:06,340 --> 01:00:07,180
Oh.

1666
01:00:11,180 --> 01:00:14,140
All right, who cares?

1667
01:00:14,140 --> 01:00:15,620
Check it out, guys.

1668
01:00:17,860 --> 01:00:18,940
I'm just trying to,

1669
01:00:22,960 --> 01:00:24,420
we're all having trouble.

1670
01:00:24,420 --> 01:00:28,540
Oh, we're all having trouble, aren't we, Kim?

1671
01:00:32,300 --> 01:00:33,260
Classic.

1672
01:00:34,820 --> 01:00:37,060
Really excellent, thank you so much.

1673
01:00:37,060 --> 01:00:39,700
People think my wiener's big because of the way I am.

1674
01:00:43,700 --> 01:00:44,540
