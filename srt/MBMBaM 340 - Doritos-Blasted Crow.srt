1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:31,840
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:47,920
Hello, everybody, and welcome to My Brother, My Brother, and Me,

6
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:52,000
an advice show for the modern era. I'm your oldest brother, Justin Tyler McElroy.

7
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,120
I'm your middle-est brother, Travis Sherman McElroy.

8
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:59,200
I'm your sweet baby brother and 30 under 30 media luminary, Griffin McElroy.

9
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:05,360
And boys, here we are. A lot of folks said we wouldn't make it to 340,

10
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:07,840
but here we are. This is it now, isn't it?

11
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:09,600
Who said that?

12
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:11,840
Looks like we made it.

13
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:17,280
The haters and the critics and the critic cartoon with John Lovitz.

14
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:22,720
I had an idea because we've been going at this for 340 episodes.

15
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:26,720
We've been doing this for 19 years. Y'all think you can fight me? Fight these tiers?

16
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:29,520
No, you can't because we've been going for so long,

17
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:32,800
and the main criticism we've been getting from the critic cartoon

18
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:36,320
is that it's just so stale, just extremely stale.

19
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:38,400
Yeah, a lot of people have said it's stale now.

20
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:41,600
They said it's crusty. They said it's got crust.

21
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:45,760
They said it's like year-old wheat thins. I said I'd still fuck with year-old wheat thins.

22
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:47,680
They're still wheat thins, like, hello.

23
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:51,520
Especially if they're one of those rosemary and olive oil kind of things.

24
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:55,760
Flavor blasted ones, absolutely, Travis. Pizza blasted wheat thins, yes.

25
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:58,640
So, I had a sort of... I like Triscuits better.

26
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:01,920
Whoa. Well, now this is a whole thing.

27
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:09,920
Whoa. Triscuits are like a single use case food stuff.

28
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:16,080
Triscuits are a better cheese conveyance than wheat thins.

29
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:19,920
Well, yeah, just because there's more area upon which for the...

30
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:23,440
Wait, hold on, hold on, hold on. Justin, did you just say you don't fuck with cheese?

31
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:26,880
I don't fuck with cheese on cracker. I like raw cheese. I don't fuck with that.

32
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:28,880
You know that. You know that about me. I don't fuck with raw cheese.

33
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:29,920
I didn't know that.

34
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:31,840
I don't fuck with raw cheese.

35
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:35,680
So, wait, it's got to be grilled or no? That's it? That's the only sort of...

36
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:40,080
No, it's got to be melted. I don't like the texture of raw cheese.

37
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:42,960
I like cooked cheese. Pizza, yes. Grilled cheese, yes.

38
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:46,400
I got you a fucking fondue set for Christmas once.

39
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:54,880
I did not know I was getting you essentially a mandatory cheese like conversion device.

40
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:56,240
Right. That's exciting.

41
00:02:57,520 --> 00:02:59,920
That fondue set is the Ellis Island of my cheese.

42
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:05,920
You have to come here first and get it in the Great American melting pot.

43
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:06,160
Give me your tired. I'm hungry. Yeah.

44
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:08,800
Literally.

45
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:11,200
Okay, so listen fuckos.

46
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:11,440
Okay.

47
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:14,960
340 is so stale. People hate it.

48
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:16,640
People like old cheese.

49
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:18,480
Like old cheese.

50
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:23,760
And so I had an idea to mix up. It can be like a special episode.

51
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:29,280
Maybe we do it every 340. Next one is popping up with 680 here in 2024 or whatever.

52
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:35,440
And that my idea is just to change the structure of the show a little bit.

53
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:36,480
It's a very special episode.

54
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:39,520
You know how TV shows do special episodes sometimes where like

55
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:41,920
there was the Real Life Simpsons that one time.

56
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:46,640
And then there was the episode of Simpsons where you saw Homer's Dick

57
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:48,320
and everybody was so excited about it.

58
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:50,800
And like it was a TV guide like catch it Homer's Dick.

59
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:52,880
What's it going to be like? Weird? Probably.

60
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:56,400
It's going to be like that. It'll be our Homer's Dick episode.

61
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:58,320
And my idea for the structure, you guys ready for this?

62
00:03:58,320 --> 00:03:59,600
I think it's quite clever.

63
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:01,600
Shows an hour long.

64
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:01,920
Okay.

65
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:08,640
What if we each have a 20 minute chunk of the podcast

66
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:15,920
where we can do our own thing and we can kind of dial out a little bit and step back

67
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:20,400
and just do what we want to do and just take a quick 20 minute break.

68
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:24,320
And I'll volunteer to take this first chunk because I think that's only fair.

69
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:25,600
And right now we're at four minutes.

70
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:27,680
So right now I have 16 minutes.

71
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:31,520
But during my 16 minute break I can get some things done that I can't get done

72
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:36,160
because my baby has stopped sleeping like he's in a fucking Nightmare on Elm Street movie.

73
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:39,680
And I can just like go cut my nails.

74
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:42,080
You can take care of your dream warrior baby.

75
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:43,600
I can take care of my dream warrior baby.

76
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:48,560
Or I can take care of my me and sleep on the rug of my office.

77
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:50,800
Let me tell you why this is an amazing idea, Griffin.

78
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:51,360
Well, hold on.

79
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:52,800
I want to tell everybody else I want to do.

80
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:56,960
And that's I'll wake up with like 90 seconds left and cut my nails

81
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:58,800
because I've been meaning to do it for like a week and a half.

82
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:02,640
And I haven't been able to cut my nails for a week and a half.

83
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:05,920
So dad lie hashtag dad life.

84
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:10,480
I love this because it's like Arrested Development sort of take on it.

85
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:13,680
Like we'll never get all the original guys in the same room again.

86
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:16,560
So this is like a spin off episode.

87
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:20,800
Not only that, but the most commonly heard feedback we get is

88
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:23,520
I can't tell the difference between your voices.

89
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:25,920
So like if we don't announce it,

90
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:30,640
I think we could go long chunks of the show without talking.

91
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:34,560
And I don't think if we just occasionally said like and I'm Justin

92
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:37,040
and like whoever says it, it doesn't really matter.

93
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:38,720
People will be like, yeah, this tracks.

94
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:40,480
I think that was all three of them.

95
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:44,880
And the chemistry between the three of us is excellent, right?

96
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:50,640
That it is the it's the witch's cauldron in which our comedy magic is mixed up

97
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:54,960
and we cast our spell like the fucking Sanderson sisters.

98
00:05:55,520 --> 00:06:00,160
But what about the individual one on one stuff?

99
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:01,520
We don't get that anymore.

100
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:05,040
So I'm going to go to fucking sleep on the floor of my office without a pillow

101
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:08,160
or blanket or anything and I'm going to cut my nails

102
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:11,920
and we'll see what like you guys have what you guys are bringing to the table.

103
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:14,000
And then and then I'll come back.

104
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,520
We'll do me and Travis and me and Justin.

105
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:20,880
This is going to be weird when we hit where Yahoo answers would normally go.

106
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:22,320
Or we just won't have it there.

107
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:23,360
Yeah, yeah.

108
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:25,920
Yeah, fucking shit.

109
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:26,640
You're right.

110
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:31,200
I wouldn't trust you guys to to get the Yahoo's going.

111
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:33,120
I would trust you guys to do sad libs.

112
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:36,880
I think it would handle it with dignity and aplomb.

113
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:40,080
A dog could do sad libs, Travis.

114
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:43,600
The work that you do could be easily recreated by a dog.

115
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:44,880
How awesome would that be?

116
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:45,840
It would be good, though.

117
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:48,400
I might have to work that out.

118
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:49,760
That is a dog's purpose.

119
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:51,120
To do.

120
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:54,480
Oh, listen to that.

121
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:56,320
Listen, we got a volunteer doing it.

122
00:06:59,040 --> 00:06:59,520
I love that.

123
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:01,440
Well, she just said boner.

124
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:03,040
Oh, I love it.

125
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:04,480
So that's a good one.

126
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:07,520
These are better than mine.

127
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:08,000
Oh, no.

128
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,120
Yeah, these are really good.

129
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:14,800
I do enjoy how much of Griffin's time we've used up with this prattling on.

130
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:19,120
Yeah, I'm actually starting to feel because I was fine when it was like four minutes,

131
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:20,640
but now it's like almost seven.

132
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:25,680
And I could do so much stuff in the seven minutes that I no longer have anymore.

133
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:26,560
I could go to heaven.

134
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:27,120
You know what I mean?

135
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:28,080
Yeah, I love that.

136
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:29,760
Do a little closet kissing.

137
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:32,720
Or I could just cut my fucking nails for once

138
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:36,960
because it's getting pretty Guinness Book of World Records over here, folks.

139
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:37,680
It's rough stuff.

140
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:41,200
Just as a test from the last time you heard me talk,

141
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:44,880
I just got up and left my microphone and just ran away.

142
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:47,200
I kept my headphones on so I could hear you guys,

143
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:48,880
but I was in the other room.

144
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:51,520
I was just enjoying the moment.

145
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:54,000
I don't want folks to get mad at us either and say like,

146
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:56,560
you guys aren't taking this seriously.

147
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:58,640
I did, this shows my everything.

148
00:07:58,640 --> 00:07:59,360
Are you kidding me?

149
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:00,000
Are you kidding me right now?

150
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,960
But I will just leave to go take a nap.

151
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,440
I will take, yeah.

152
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:07,360
All right, well, I'll start by carrying the load.

153
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:14,080
Griffin, you obviously can't sleep now because you've only got 13 minutes, almost 12 minutes.

154
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:16,400
You're right, I'll sacrifice, I'll sacrifice my block.

155
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:16,960
Okay, great.

156
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:19,680
I don't think we're gonna do your idea,

157
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:22,640
but I would like to read a question if you guys are ready.

158
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:24,240
Oh, all right.

159
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:30,160
Okay, just I want you to know that I'm going to spread my 20 minutes throughout the show.

160
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:32,480
So if there's like a 30 second chunk where you're like,

161
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:35,440
Travis hasn't said anything for a while, that's my time.

162
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:37,440
Okay, so just your usual-

163
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:38,320
Just the usual thing.

164
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:39,120
Sort of way.

165
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:42,400
I'm probably gonna zone out and like check my Twitter replies

166
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:44,640
to see what people have said about me and-

167
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:45,600
Hey, what's the sound?

168
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:46,080
What's that?

169
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:49,040
Really?

170
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:51,680
Really?

171
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:52,880
I want a munch!

172
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:53,680
Munch!

173
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:54,180
Squad!

174
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:58,400
I want to munch!

175
00:08:59,200 --> 00:08:59,700
Squad!

176
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:04,320
Here's the thing about the Munch Squad, Justin, especially when you lead with it.

177
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:09,520
I put about three to four hours of work into putting together a question list

178
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:12,400
and then we lead off with a Munch Squad and it just, it just-

179
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:16,560
I have told you so many fucking times, just save the ones we don't use.

180
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:17,360
You never do it.

181
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:19,360
But those are old, they get stale like old cheese, Justin.

182
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:20,880
They're evergreen, Travis.

183
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:23,040
Just recycle them if we don't use them.

184
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:24,800
I've told you this a thousand times.

185
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:27,040
Well, we just keep getting these topical problems.

186
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:28,400
Shut up.

187
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:29,120
If we-

188
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:30,560
That's ridiculous.

189
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:32,320
At the rate, at the rate we-

190
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:34,320
Travis puts together a list of like 14 questions

191
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:35,760
and then we answer three during the show.

192
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:39,680
If we reused ones from the back catalog, we would be answering questions today like,

193
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:41,920
I'm sad that Friends is ending.

194
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:44,640
Yeah, I know everybody has-

195
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:50,080
Everybody in America has probably felt a vibe this week of like,

196
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:53,360
things are really good and I wonder if you're-

197
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:53,840
That's weird.

198
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:56,320
For me, it was opposite.

199
00:09:57,280 --> 00:09:59,360
No, I'm pretty sure everybody in America has felt this way

200
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:03,760
and you haven't exactly known why, but this is about osmosis.

201
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:05,120
It's about fluid intelligence.

202
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:09,280
It's something about awareness that we all share

203
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:14,880
and that awareness is that finally, after months of being denied it,

204
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:18,800
finally Taco Bell has dropped it on us.

205
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:20,080
That's right.

206
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:26,480
The naked chicken chalupa is in stores nationwide as of Jan 26th.

207
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:29,040
There-

208
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:30,800
Here's the subhead of the press release.

209
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:32,800
Well, explain what the-

210
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:34,800
The subhead of the press release explains it.

211
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:36,640
The shell is the chicken.

212
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:39,040
The chicken is the shell.

213
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:44,240
When you eat a sandwich and you eat a taco,

214
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:49,840
you are participating in an unspoken social agreement

215
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:52,400
that there are parts of your food

216
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:55,120
you're allowed to touch with your bare grubby, nasty naked hands.

217
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:55,600
Correct.

218
00:10:57,040 --> 00:11:03,440
And it's the carbohydrate parts of the food experience.

219
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:05,120
You can touch it right on the carbs.

220
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:05,680
That's fine.

221
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:08,560
And you can eat where you touched it on the carbs and that's fine

222
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:10,560
because we all agree that that's okay.

223
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:16,960
That's okay. This and its bastard brother, the Double Down,

224
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:20,880
is such a perversion of that rule

225
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:24,720
because that's the part of the food that is not good to touch.

226
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:25,360
Not pleasant.

227
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:26,240
It's not good to touch.

228
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:27,280
That's not good to-

229
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:28,240
No, it feels pleasant.

230
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:29,760
I'm sure it feels pleasant or whatever,

231
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:33,840
but that's not the touching part of the food.

232
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:34,960
It's not the carbohydrate.

233
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:36,560
Quick sidebar before we talk about this.

234
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:40,400
I'm sorry that this podcast is like it is sometimes.

235
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:41,120
Quick sidebar.

236
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:46,800
When you guys are driving and your wife is in the passenger seat

237
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:49,520
and you're on a road trip and you stop for food on the way,

238
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:55,200
Sydney had this thing where she would unwrap the food halfway

239
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:59,600
so I could hold it in a wrapper while I ate the food.

240
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:01,680
And after 10 years, I finally told her,

241
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:03,440
that's insane.

242
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:07,040
I just need to hold the sandwich like just the whole thing.

243
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:10,960
Do you guys run into this issue and where do you stand on it?

244
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:14,400
As long as we're talking about touching food.

245
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:18,480
My problem is that if I do that,

246
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:25,840
I will be very cognizant of the fact that I don't want to eat the wrapper

247
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:30,640
and seem like some sort of comedy fat man.

248
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:33,760
There's nothing worse than like pulling away

249
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:36,000
and seeing a bite mark into the paper.

250
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,640
In their paper, but I already swallowed it and it was like,

251
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:42,240
damn, that checkers paper though, it's got like a spice to it.

252
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:44,000
That's the problem right there.

253
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
Give me some flavored edible paper.

254
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,880
You see people like that on My Strange Addiction all the time.

255
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:50,560
You know, people don't eat their mattresses.

256
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:52,240
The first bite is always by accident.

257
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:55,520
My Strange Addiction, the original Munch Squad.

258
00:12:55,520 --> 00:13:01,680
I want a Munch a mattress.

259
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:02,880
Justin, to answer your question,

260
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:06,640
if I am traveling, my food of choice is always

261
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:10,480
and will always be the Dairy Queen chicken strip basket

262
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:12,960
with a gravy and toast within it.

263
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:18,480
Are you fucking kidding me that when you're operating a motor vehicle,

264
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:21,440
your food of choice is a dippable?

265
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:22,160
It's a dippable?

266
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:25,760
I will drive 40 to 50 miles out of my way

267
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:28,800
to find a Dairy Queen if I'm on the road.

268
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:29,040
Yeah.

269
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:30,160
But it's a dippable?

270
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:32,880
But it's also got gravy in it, Justin.

271
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:36,880
How often do you find gravy in a fast food experience?

272
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:39,280
If you're eating fast food while you're driving,

273
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:41,680
you have to let go of the fact that you will not have,

274
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:44,400
like I'm living ketchup free on this one.

275
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:46,080
This one's a ketchup free-mish

276
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:49,040
because I can't be dipping while I'm driving.

277
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:55,120
Anyway, unless you've practiced it a bajillion times, which I have.

278
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:55,600
All right.

279
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:57,680
Did we ever tell the story of when we were doing

280
00:13:57,680 --> 00:14:02,800
the Pacific Northwest shows in Portland, Seattle, and Vancouver,

281
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:05,040
and it was Riley's birthday and she was with us,

282
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:08,720
and so you stopped at a DQ and we got her ice cream cake

283
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:14,880
that was hard as cinder block and we ate a micrometer of it,

284
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:20,320
and then Travis tried to give the cake back to the people at the register

285
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:24,480
as if to say, you can hand out free slices to folks if you want,

286
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:28,320
and then I think we just sort of set it on top of the garbage can

287
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:30,560
and got back on that lonely road.

288
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:31,680
Happy birthday, Riley.

289
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:34,240
I do want to note, I wasn't trying to get a refund

290
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:35,680
for the unused portion of the cake.

291
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:38,160
No, Travis went up there and said,

292
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:39,680
you guys sell ice cream here, huh?

293
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:42,000
How about you give this ice cream away for free?

294
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,280
And they said, no.

295
00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:46,320
And he said, well, we'll throw it away if not.

296
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:48,000
And they said, welcome to DQ.

297
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,400
We don't care where the ice cream ends up as long as it's not here.

298
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:55,200
So the naked chalupa is the question on everybody's mind.

299
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:56,400
The naked chicken chalupa.

300
00:14:56,400 --> 00:15:00,560
Taco Bell is coming unshelled with its latest food innovation.

301
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:02,160
It's coming unspooled.

302
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:04,320
It's becoming unraveled.

303
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:07,280
Coming in the form of the first taco shell made entirely

304
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:12,960
of marinated all white crispy chicken as if history has its eyes

305
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:13,680
on Taco Bell.

306
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:20,000
First we won the space race, and now we've won the taco shell,

307
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,280
but it's chicken race.

308
00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:24,240
No, that means you lost the Earth race

309
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:25,920
if you made a chicken shell.

310
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:28,720
That's what I have to say about it.

311
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:31,680
What does Marisa Thalberg, chief marketing officer at Taco Bell Corp,

312
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:32,080
have to say?

313
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:33,600
Well, she has to say this.

314
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:36,080
Something that is delicious yet different

315
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:38,320
is bound to ruffle some feathers.

316
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:41,840
Some might even cluck their tongues at it.

317
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:47,120
However, fuck this is funny, however, we feel confident

318
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:49,920
that once our fans get a taste of the naked chicken chalupa,

319
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:54,080
they're going to understand exactly why this is our next big fun

320
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:55,920
and craveable innovation.

321
00:15:55,920 --> 00:16:00,240
Following the footsteps of the Doritos Locos taco five years ago

322
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:00,800
and the queso lupa.

323
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:03,840
Oh my god, the slow march of time.

324
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:04,880
It is a nightmare.

325
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:06,880
You could tell they kind of fail it though, right?

326
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:09,440
Like, listen, we need another hit.

327
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:10,800
We need a hit so bad.

328
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:12,000
We need a hit.

329
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:16,080
It's been five years since the taco, taco loco, taco Dorito taco.

330
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:18,080
The shell, what's the shell?

331
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:22,800
Well, it's four ounces of marinated all white meat,

332
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:24,400
antibiotic free chicken,

333
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:27,440
kicked up with bold Mexican spices and seasoning

334
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:28,800
and it's packed with fresh.

335
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:31,360
Now, they described the chicken there.

336
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:33,920
The clause that is missing from that sentence, of course,

337
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:37,840
is that has been bent into a fucking taco shell.

338
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:40,400
Into a ghoulish smile.

339
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:43,600
Also, there's diced ripe tomatoes,

340
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:45,600
cheddar cheese and creamy avocado ranch.

341
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:50,720
Justin, can I tell you why I am just the most fucking pissed off

342
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:52,560
at this press release?

343
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:53,440
Jeez.

344
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:55,280
Why are you so angry?

345
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:58,880
In the first sentence, they chicken pun twice.

346
00:16:59,440 --> 00:16:59,840
Yeah.

347
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:00,320
And then they sort of drop the cookie.

348
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:02,080
And then nothing.

349
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:02,400
Yeah.

350
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:07,440
I'm in the desert right now looking for a good chicken pun oasis,

351
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:08,320
but there is none.

352
00:17:08,320 --> 00:17:10,880
I do want to just point something out very quickly.

353
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:12,080
Please do this.

354
00:17:12,080 --> 00:17:15,600
On the antibiotic free section, there's an asterisk.

355
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:18,320
Horrifyingly, there's an asterisk.

356
00:17:18,320 --> 00:17:19,760
And if we scroll down the end of the press release,

357
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:23,760
it says antibiotic chicken in this case means chicken raised

358
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:26,240
without antibiotics important to human medicine.

359
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:26,960
Okay.

360
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:27,920
So, okay.

361
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:28,480
All right.

362
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:30,000
So, what you mean-

363
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,560
This chicken does not have rubella.

364
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:33,600
Good, good.

365
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:34,000
So it doesn't have-

366
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,320
We can give this chicken penicillin.

367
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:37,120
Don't you worry.

368
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:37,840
Okay, great.

369
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:38,960
But other ones, yeah.

370
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:40,240
But it's antibiotic free.

371
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:40,960
You got it.

372
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:42,240
Eat your chicken, tubby.

373
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:46,320
And you're going to have to enjoy it on a wing and a prayer.

374
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:48,560
If this is the last episode of our show,

375
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:50,640
there's not a Bim Bam 341.

376
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:54,320
I want everybody to know it is because I have walked into the taco bell

377
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:55,520
that is around the corner from my house.

378
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:57,920
And I did have a bomb strapped to my chest.

379
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:04,240
And I did demand that they make me a Doritos Locos chicken chalupa mistake taco.

380
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:07,600
If you think that isn't fucking common, you don't know these motherfuckers.

381
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:10,960
Can you blast it and then crunch wrap it?

382
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:13,040
Sir, I can't look at my chest.

383
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:13,840
Look at the device.

384
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:16,400
Crunch wrap and blast the chicken shell.

385
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:19,360
I have nothing left to live for.

386
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:22,240
I'm in a taco bell ordering food hacks.

387
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:25,840
Spray the chicken with Doritos dust.

388
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:28,640
And then wrap it in cinnamon sugar cap and crunch.

389
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:29,280
Wrap it!

390
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:31,120
Why are you having trouble with this?

391
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:34,880
That's a flavor that'll give them something to squawk about.

392
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:37,040
That would be good to demand it in a crunch wrap.

393
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:41,200
And they say, well, sir, to do that, we'd have to have a flat chicken piece.

394
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:43,760
Like, yeah, I know.

395
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:44,560
Can you imagine?

396
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:48,320
Can you imagine flat chicken feeling peckish?

397
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:49,680
Stop it.

398
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:53,200
Travis, take your 20 minutes.

399
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:57,200
This is something to crow about.

400
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:57,840
It's in there.

401
00:18:57,840 --> 00:18:58,320
I haven't.

402
00:18:58,320 --> 00:18:58,960
Yeah, that's right.

403
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:01,280
We use all natural antibiotic free crows.

404
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:04,560
Not like a rooster crows.

405
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:08,080
Do you want a bite of this?

406
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:09,680
Yes, you coggledoodle do.

407
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:14,560
If antibiotic free means some antibiotics, then naked chicken chalupa

408
00:19:14,560 --> 00:19:16,640
could certainly mean naked crows chalupa.

409
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:22,960
These are crows that spent some time with chickens like during spring break.

410
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:26,320
Hey, listen, I don't want to panic anybody.

411
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:26,960
Yeah, Reggie?

412
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:31,360
Reggie, I've been the lead food scientist here for how long?

413
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:33,600
About 10 years.

414
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:35,200
You've really been fucking it up.

415
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:38,240
Yeah, listen, yesterday I killed a crow.

416
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:42,800
And when I carved its breast meat from its bottom.

417
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:43,920
I carved the flesh.

418
00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:45,680
I collected the bones for the ritual.

419
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:46,960
I collected the bones for the ritual.

420
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:47,840
I carved the breast meat.

421
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:49,280
Normally I would discard it.

422
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:51,440
And then I came upon a terrifying realization.

423
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:53,520
It was a perfect yield.

424
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:58,160
The breasts of the crow had formed a taco shell.

425
00:19:58,800 --> 00:20:00,640
This is a sign from the ancients.

426
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:03,360
Margaret, can you bread this shit?

427
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:08,960
Bread this for once and Margaret, we're going to need more crows.

428
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:14,400
You are thinking far too far outside of the bun.

429
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:17,040
You need to think a little bit closer to the bun.

430
00:20:17,040 --> 00:20:19,120
You need to think a little bit closer to the bun.

431
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:21,600
You're as far from the bun as like you're on some like

432
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:25,680
Lovecraftian, like Miskatonic University.

433
00:20:25,680 --> 00:20:28,160
That's how fucking far you are from the bun.

434
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:29,680
You need to leave the university

435
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:32,960
and move just like a few miles closer to the bun, please.

436
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:37,440
People forget that like outside the bun encompasses all existence

437
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:39,680
that is not contained within the bun.

438
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:42,800
There are no borders on being outside the bun.

439
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:46,080
Limits are what keeps society on rails, Taco Bell.

440
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:47,920
Get back near the bun, please.

441
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:49,360
Please keep the bun in eyesight.

442
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:52,160
Seventh or eighth meal shit at this point.

443
00:20:52,160 --> 00:20:53,360
We're on the eighth meal.

444
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:54,720
Everything's topsy turvy.

445
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:57,120
Get back on the bun, Taco Bell.

446
00:20:57,120 --> 00:20:59,520
I want Taco Bell needs to way over correct

447
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:00,960
and their next thing is like we made a hamburger.

448
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:02,960
We're sorry, we're sorry, we're sorry, we're sorry.

449
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:03,520
We're in the bun.

450
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:04,080
We're in the bun.

451
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:04,640
We're in the bun.

452
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:05,280
We're in the bun.

453
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:09,040
Let's just keep this fucking fast food train rolling real quick

454
00:21:09,040 --> 00:21:11,520
because I have a really good Yahoo here from Brooks Oglesby.

455
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:11,760
Thank you.

456
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:13,520
It's from Yahoo Answers user Rebecca.

457
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:16,560
Altaba user, it's just going to take me a while.

458
00:21:16,560 --> 00:21:22,240
Altaba user Rebecca says, asks, what is Wendy's policy when you're lost?

459
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:26,160
Is it true that if you go through the drive-through at Wendy's

460
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:29,040
and say you're lost, they have to give you a free cheeseburger?

461
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:30,800
What?

462
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,360
Hey, I don't know where I am.

463
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:36,240
And I thought I was supposed to be here, but I'm not.

464
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:39,680
So yes, sir, pull around.

465
00:21:39,680 --> 00:21:40,320
You know the drill.

466
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:43,120
Get your free cheeseburger.

467
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:44,160
But not directions?

468
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:45,920
No.

469
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:46,720
No, no, no, no.

470
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:49,040
Well, look under the bun, Justin.

471
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:51,680
Where's I-10?

472
00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:53,360
I'm trying to get on the 10.

473
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:54,960
Oh, good luck with that.

474
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:56,080
Here's your cheeseburger.

475
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:56,640
No charge.

476
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:58,560
Having a rough day, huh?

477
00:21:58,560 --> 00:21:59,920
It can be scary being lost.

478
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:02,080
It can be scary being lost.

479
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:03,200
What if you're a little kid?

480
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:04,480
I can't find my parents.

481
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:05,120
Oh, shit.

482
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:06,560
Here you go.

483
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:09,520
I'm sorry about your folks.

484
00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:11,200
You don't even have a car.

485
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:12,320
Do you have a phone right now?

486
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:14,000
Shit.

487
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,040
Can I use your phone?

488
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:15,360
No.

489
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:15,920
No.

490
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:16,480
Here's a burger.

491
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:17,200
Here's a burger, though.

492
00:22:19,040 --> 00:22:25,280
We laugh, but can you, Justin and Griffin, can you tell me 100%

493
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:30,000
that Wendy's will not give you a free cheeseburger if you are lost?

494
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:30,560
That's what I'm saying.

495
00:22:30,560 --> 00:22:30,880
I don't know.

496
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:33,600
Dave Thomas is a kind soul, probably.

497
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:34,240
I don't know.

498
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:34,880
I'm just saying.

499
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:38,560
I think Dave Thomas probably, if I remember this urban legend correctly,

500
00:22:38,560 --> 00:22:40,400
Dave Thomas used to hand deliver the hamburger.

501
00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:42,560
You would pull up and say you're lost.

502
00:22:42,560 --> 00:22:45,200
There would be a beat and then your passenger door would open.

503
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:46,640
Hey, you having a little bit of trouble?

504
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:49,520
Like a Saint Bernard.

505
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:53,120
He would come find you and bring you back to the Wendy's.

506
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:54,160
Wrapped around his neck.

507
00:22:56,560 --> 00:22:58,160
And you had to eat it off his neck.

508
00:22:58,160 --> 00:22:59,520
You couldn't remove it from his neck.

509
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:01,520
He was a nasty, nasty old man.

510
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:04,320
Now the problem is that once Dave Thomas saved you,

511
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:08,000
you then owed him a life debt and you would have to come work at Wendy's

512
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,440
for a fair wage.

513
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:12,480
This was not taking advantage of people.

514
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:14,800
That was just how he hired people.

515
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:16,240
And that way you were never lost again

516
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:18,320
because you just knew you worked at Wendy's.

517
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:22,640
Now sometimes Dave Thomas would wear his neck burger on like a long chain.

518
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:25,840
So it just like sort of be greasy on his bare chest.

519
00:23:27,040 --> 00:23:30,480
And so you'd be in there and you'd be like, I'm lost.

520
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:35,200
I'm trying to get on Research Highway.

521
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:37,440
But then Dave Thomas is there.

522
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:39,360
He's like, but now you're found.

523
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:42,000
And he just sort of puts his chest like on you.

524
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,520
I know where you're at, Dave.

525
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:44,240
I don't know where I am.

526
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:45,520
I know where you are.

527
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:46,160
You're home.

528
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:46,880
I know where you are.

529
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:47,680
I know where you're going to be.

530
00:23:47,680 --> 00:23:48,480
You're home right now.

531
00:23:49,040 --> 00:23:49,680
Wendy's?

532
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:50,480
That's right.

533
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:51,200
Shackle noise.

534
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:57,040
Now I'm actually doing gluten-free.

535
00:23:57,040 --> 00:23:58,720
So can I get a cup of chili?

536
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:00,480
Oh, yeah.

537
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:01,040
Hold on.

538
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:05,760
Oh, why do we serve it so hot?

539
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:06,720
Quick, quick, quick, quick.

540
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:10,720
Uh, listen, I'm a good guy.

541
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:12,240
You're not going to want to eat the chili.

542
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:15,360
It's just cut up hamburgers that we couldn't sell.

543
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:16,400
You knew that, right?

544
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:16,720
Okay.

545
00:24:17,280 --> 00:24:20,240
It's a cut up hamburgers and ketchup and we make it real hot.

546
00:24:21,920 --> 00:24:23,760
I don't even, we don't even put beans in it.

547
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:25,200
I don't know how the fuck they get in there.

548
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:29,440
Where are these beans coming from?

549
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:31,440
We've discovered some sort of alchemy.

550
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,280
It turns salt packets.

551
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:35,280
They just turn into beans in the cauldron.

552
00:24:35,280 --> 00:24:36,640
I think these kids will love this.

553
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:40,800
Did you know that there was no beans in Wendy's chili?

554
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:41,760
You just thought there were.

555
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:44,960
And it's one of those, like, reality distortion things.

556
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:46,160
Huh.

557
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:50,640
During a meeting at work yesterday afternoon, I noticed a tear.

558
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:52,480
Okay.

559
00:24:53,040 --> 00:24:56,080
I thought it was tear, but that wouldn't make sense with the rest of the sentence.

560
00:24:56,080 --> 00:24:58,560
I noticed a tear in the seat of co-worker's pants.

561
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:00,960
Somebody cried in my co-worker's butt.

562
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:02,720
A single tear in their pants.

563
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:06,160
It was vertical four or five inches long, but very narrow.

564
00:25:06,160 --> 00:25:10,320
You could see his black underwear, but nothing revealing after the meeting.

565
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:12,560
I was going to see his balls or whatever.

566
00:25:12,560 --> 00:25:13,920
No balls on this one.

567
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:18,320
After the meeting, I was going to tell him about it, but I decided not to.

568
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:21,120
So he wouldn't worry about it for the rest of the day.

569
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:24,000
I figured he would find it as soon as he got home and tell him about it.

570
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:27,280
Would only embarrass him when he couldn't do anything about it.

571
00:25:27,280 --> 00:25:28,240
Am I good or sure?

572
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:29,120
I've mentioned it to him.

573
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:31,520
That's from Tom torn in the twin cities.

574
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:32,880
Or Tom.

575
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:33,600
Or Tom.

576
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:34,800
It looks like Tom on my screen.

577
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:36,400
Our end, man.

578
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:38,800
They trick you sometimes because it just looks like the M shape.

579
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:45,360
Can we lay down a blanket so we and then we can like just sort of wipe any future questions

580
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:49,120
like this just off this light and lay down a blanket like my friend had a booger or my

581
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:53,760
friend had some stuff in their TV or my friend, you know, and just say, like, always tell them

582
00:25:54,560 --> 00:25:57,200
you always you may not want to hear it.

583
00:25:57,200 --> 00:26:03,120
It may be challenging to hear it, but you need to fucking get your shit right.

584
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:05,760
And I don't know what this guy does except maybe he goes home.

585
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:09,440
Everybody's always, always, always, always, always, always looking for an excuse to take

586
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:10,240
a half day at work.

587
00:26:11,280 --> 00:26:14,640
And this is this is this is decent justification for sure.

588
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:15,600
Always, always.

589
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:20,320
If I have shit in my teeth, tell me fucking tell me if I have a big just just snozzberry

590
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:23,280
in there, just tell me about it so I can go deal with my shit.

591
00:26:23,280 --> 00:26:29,440
Also, like, I do things like there's things you can do in a context that often like let

592
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:34,080
him put a couple of safety pins in there or maybe some fucking masking tape, jacket around

593
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:34,880
his waist.

594
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:38,160
Yeah, yeah, tight jacket around the waist safety pins.

595
00:26:38,160 --> 00:26:42,480
No matter what, it's going to be bringing back like a mid aughts hot topic look that

596
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:44,160
is really popping off again.

597
00:26:44,160 --> 00:26:48,880
But I really like the question askers justification of like I didn't want him to worry about it

598
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:49,920
for the rest of the day.

599
00:26:49,920 --> 00:26:55,440
So instead you let him get home and and realize that and think about like all the lunges he

600
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:58,960
did and all the times he stood in front of people without knowing it.

601
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:01,200
So now we can worry about it for the rest of his life.

602
00:27:02,160 --> 00:27:07,040
What if but like the Bible says you should address the plank in your own eye before you

603
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:10,320
worry about the dust in your neighbor's eye.

604
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:15,360
What if you were like, hey, listen, you have a small tear in the back of your pants and

605
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:18,880
they spin around on you and you're like, you're not wearing pants.

606
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:20,560
You forgot pants today.

607
00:27:21,280 --> 00:27:23,440
You have a two by four in your eye.

608
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:23,840
What?

609
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:24,480
What?

610
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:24,960
Oh, God.

611
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:29,760
And also you just discovered that you're back in high school because you never finished

612
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:30,560
that one class.

613
00:27:30,560 --> 00:27:33,840
So you didn't really graduate and you have to take that math test again.

614
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:35,680
But you don't remember any of the math.

615
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:39,200
Well, why am I the only one who has that dream?

616
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:41,680
That's not a it's not a dream.

617
00:27:41,680 --> 00:27:42,720
This was a real scenario.

618
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:43,600
Justin was addressing.

619
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:47,520
Yeah, I'm just trying to I'm trying to figure out what scenario you might find yourself

620
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:52,160
in where you're not wearing any pants and you didn't know it until someone said it.

621
00:27:52,160 --> 00:27:54,400
It was just kind of a funny joke for our podcast, Trav.

622
00:27:55,760 --> 00:27:56,720
Sorry you got so hung up.

623
00:27:58,080 --> 00:27:59,120
No, I like it.

624
00:27:59,120 --> 00:27:59,840
I like this, though.

625
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:00,320
I liked it.

626
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:02,000
That's Travis' pitch to a fun new game.

627
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:03,680
And that's what if these questions are dreams?

628
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:07,680
And it's an advice happening we've never really explored before, which is like, oh,

629
00:28:07,680 --> 00:28:08,480
you dreamed this.

630
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:12,960
It didn't it didn't happen.

631
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:13,760
You dreamt it.

632
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:14,560
So you're fine.

633
00:28:14,560 --> 00:28:19,280
That would be a good tack to take with your co-worker like, hey, these are tearing your

634
00:28:19,280 --> 00:28:19,600
pants.

635
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:22,240
But before you get worried, none of this is real.

636
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:24,320
Kiss me.

637
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:25,120
Kiss me right now.

638
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:27,120
Hope your teeth are falling out.

639
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:27,600
Better hurry.

640
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:28,640
Eat that stapler.

641
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:29,600
It's marshmallows.

642
00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:32,640
Justin, can you do the next question after this one?

643
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:35,120
Because I love it and I want to do it right now.

644
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:36,400
The one after it is great, too.

645
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:37,600
Travis really did a good job.

646
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:42,000
Yeah, it's too bad we're only going to get to do like one more of these because we spent

647
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:43,520
a lot of time talking about nasty chicken.

648
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:46,560
I work in an office with the rest of my company.

649
00:28:46,560 --> 00:28:51,200
And at the end of the day, we exchanged pleasantries saying good night, have a good weekend, etc.

650
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:55,120
However, sometimes my brain interrupts these rote actions and tells me, blow them a kiss.

651
00:29:05,040 --> 00:29:06,240
Hey, blow them a kiss.

652
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:07,520
I've never done it.

653
00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:09,200
Thank God for impulse control.

654
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:13,040
But the fleeing thought springs into my head up to a couple of times a month.

655
00:29:13,040 --> 00:29:15,600
How do I fight these thoughts down and make it go away?

656
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:19,120
Or should I embrace this freedom from standard and dive in?

657
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:21,040
That's from neurotic Newark.

658
00:29:21,040 --> 00:29:21,760
Holy shit.

659
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:24,480
Is there a method?

660
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:25,760
Is there a way?

661
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:32,720
Is there a way to blow a kiss that is not childish?

662
00:29:33,920 --> 00:29:37,200
Has anybody ever blown a kiss and been like, mm, cool?

663
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:38,560
Or like, mm, professional?

664
00:29:38,560 --> 00:29:40,480
Or mm, adult sexy?

665
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:44,160
I think if you practice it well enough, you could do, like, blow a kiss into finger guns.

666
00:29:44,160 --> 00:29:44,800
Like, mwah.

667
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:45,440
I just did it.

668
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:46,640
I just did it.

669
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:51,840
And I think if you just, like, kiss your hand and then, like, very, very slightly extend it,

670
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:57,280
you don't, like, create a fucking launch pad that you then boost your kiss off of.

671
00:29:57,280 --> 00:30:00,000
Like, some sort of VTOL plane.

672
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:04,240
If you just, like, and then just sort of very lightly, don't even lay it flat.

673
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:06,000
Just, like, take it away from your face.

674
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:07,040
That's kind of a cool look.

675
00:30:07,040 --> 00:30:09,680
Like, I'm doing, I know you can't see it.

676
00:30:09,680 --> 00:30:12,480
But it does kind of look cool how I'm doing it.

677
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:14,080
Maybe you blow a kiss in your right hand.

678
00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:15,120
And what's that in your left hand?

679
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:15,620
A dove.

680
00:30:16,160 --> 00:30:16,560
Okay.

681
00:30:16,560 --> 00:30:17,120
That's good.

682
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:17,600
Just direct.

683
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:19,680
I don't want you to have to have a bird.

684
00:30:19,680 --> 00:30:26,240
I think the only context in which blowing a kiss is acceptable for a professional setting

685
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:31,040
is if your job is James Bond villain and you just put him in a trap that's supposed to kill him.

686
00:30:31,040 --> 00:30:34,720
If you do that and you blow him a kiss, it's, like, very, that's very evil.

687
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:35,440
It's really cool.

688
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:36,240
Very taunting.

689
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:36,800
I love that.

690
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:39,680
But other than that, no.

691
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:40,880
Ever.

692
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:41,120
Oh.

693
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:41,680
I'm pretty sure.

694
00:30:41,680 --> 00:30:42,160
Dang.

695
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:45,920
I feel like you didn't really think about it.

696
00:30:45,920 --> 00:30:46,420
Okay.

697
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:47,920
Bond villain.

698
00:30:47,920 --> 00:30:48,800
Killing James Bond.

699
00:30:48,800 --> 00:30:49,360
For sure.

700
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:50,400
That one's definite.

701
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:50,900
Yeah.

702
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:55,520
Maybe if you just fired someone and you're a real jerk.

703
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:59,760
You'd be like, mm, mm, mm.

704
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:00,800
That's good.

705
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:03,920
I thought that's what you were going to say, but you said a real jerk.

706
00:31:03,920 --> 00:31:07,920
Real jerk, but yeah, that's a good one.

707
00:31:07,920 --> 00:31:08,800
That's a good one, too.

708
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:10,240
Or it could just be, like, your new thing.

709
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:14,320
I think it could be cute.

710
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:14,880
I don't know.

711
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:16,960
I mean, it would be a fucking zag, though, right?

712
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:18,480
I mean, it would be a zag and a half.

713
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:19,760
That's a zag and a half.

714
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:24,880
I like this idea of your brain is, like, this friend of yours who, like, always comes up

715
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:26,800
with suggestions and it's, like, well, you know what?

716
00:31:26,800 --> 00:31:28,400
You could try blowing him a kiss.

717
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:29,120
And it's, like, no.

718
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:34,400
It's, like, maybe if just once you tried it, your friend would be, like, okay, thank you

719
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:36,000
for acknowledging my input.

720
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:36,880
I was wrong.

721
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:40,400
Or maybe it is the way to go.

722
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:42,400
Maybe your brain knows better.

723
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:44,640
Maybe your subconscious is, like, blow him a kiss.

724
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:47,040
You do it, and suddenly, like, ooh, I like Todd's new thing.

725
00:31:47,040 --> 00:31:47,680
And what's that?

726
00:31:47,680 --> 00:31:48,960
Suddenly, Todd's CEO.

727
00:31:50,560 --> 00:31:54,240
Fucking a thousand years ago, fucking dark ages move in bam.

728
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:58,320
It was just the three of us sitting around a stick in a swamp.

729
00:31:58,320 --> 00:32:09,200
And somebody was, like, I conducted mine self with mine serf and felt the extraordinary

730
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:15,200
urge to grasp his hand firmly and shake it violently.

731
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:17,520
Should I embrace this?

732
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:19,120
Neurotic and Newark.

733
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:24,240
And it's, like, that first person was just, like, give me that hand, sucker.

734
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:25,280
And he grabbed it and shook it.

735
00:32:25,280 --> 00:32:26,640
It was, like, this is good.

736
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:27,200
I like it.

737
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:28,640
I like it.

738
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:29,280
I like this.

739
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:31,840
I don't see why this has to be any different from that.

740
00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:33,120
Give me that little paw.

741
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:34,720
What are you doing?

742
00:32:35,680 --> 00:32:36,400
Are we fighting?

743
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:38,160
No, we're not fighting, bud.

744
00:32:38,160 --> 00:32:39,120
I want to go.

745
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:39,600
You can.

746
00:32:40,160 --> 00:32:41,040
I'm going to let you go.

747
00:32:41,040 --> 00:32:41,760
Hold on.

748
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:42,560
I'm going to let you go.

749
00:32:42,560 --> 00:32:43,200
I'm just going to.

750
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:45,840
Hey, look, I feel like we just did business.

751
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:46,560
Yeah, I know.

752
00:32:46,560 --> 00:32:47,120
Yeah.

753
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:47,440
Yeah.

754
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:47,840
I know.

755
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:48,720
It's because I grabbed you.

756
00:32:49,280 --> 00:32:51,760
A bit of advice on this advice show.

757
00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:53,520
What about the first time somebody did a fist bump?

758
00:32:54,160 --> 00:32:55,680
Like, oh, god, he's going to punch me in the stomach.

759
00:32:55,680 --> 00:32:56,640
No, no, no.

760
00:32:56,640 --> 00:32:57,440
No, you don't understand.

761
00:32:57,440 --> 00:32:58,080
Or a high five.

762
00:32:58,080 --> 00:33:00,080
Are you going to smack me on top of the head?

763
00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:00,800
No, friend.

764
00:33:00,800 --> 00:33:01,600
No, no, friend.

765
00:33:02,160 --> 00:33:03,120
A bit of advice.

766
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:04,560
If this is going to be a new thing,

767
00:33:04,560 --> 00:33:08,240
if you're going to insert, you have to do it so you can't

768
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:10,720
acknowledge that you've just done a new thing.

769
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:12,160
You have to do it like, yeah, goodnight.

770
00:33:12,800 --> 00:33:17,280
And then go back to your desk and let them soak it in

771
00:33:17,280 --> 00:33:20,640
without you doing it and then kind of watching their reaction.

772
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:23,680
You can't acknowledge that this is a new thing you're trying.

773
00:33:23,680 --> 00:33:26,560
This has to be a thing you've done a million times.

774
00:33:26,560 --> 00:33:28,320
You don't even think about it anymore.

775
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:30,480
This is just your thing.

776
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:34,320
I found the way to describe the physical act of this kiss

777
00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:35,280
blow that I'm talking about.

778
00:33:35,280 --> 00:33:37,200
Like, the cool, confident kiss blow.

779
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:40,000
That's, again, just a very slight, like, just barely hand

780
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:40,800
away from it.

781
00:33:40,800 --> 00:33:45,040
And imagine that you're Glenn Close and you've just met

782
00:33:45,040 --> 00:33:47,200
an enthusiastic young fan.

783
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:52,160
And you're just like, you're walking out of the fucking club

784
00:33:52,160 --> 00:33:54,000
where you've just been bumping it all night because you're

785
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:55,600
Glenn Close and you know how to tear shit up.

786
00:33:56,320 --> 00:33:57,840
And you see a fan on the street and they're like,

787
00:33:57,840 --> 00:34:00,560
Glenn, Glenn, you're so great.

788
00:34:00,560 --> 00:34:03,040
I'm so glad that you're getting back on Broadway.

789
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:08,720
The kiss blow that she does in that moment of just, like,

790
00:34:08,720 --> 00:34:10,240
she doesn't go through it all the way.

791
00:34:10,240 --> 00:34:13,280
It's just, oh, and she takes her hand away from her face

792
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:13,840
just a little bit.

793
00:34:13,840 --> 00:34:16,320
You're like, oh, Glenn, Glenn, you've got me.

794
00:34:17,120 --> 00:34:18,960
That's sort of the style I'm talking about.

795
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:22,960
Griffin, Justin, I feel like we are missing a big component

796
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:24,160
here that we're not addressing.

797
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:26,640
Because we keep talking about the kiss.

798
00:34:28,240 --> 00:34:29,680
I don't think that's the weird part.

799
00:34:29,680 --> 00:34:30,560
I think it's the blowing.

800
00:34:30,560 --> 00:34:31,120
It's the blowing.

801
00:34:31,120 --> 00:34:31,840
That's what I'm talking about.

802
00:34:31,840 --> 00:34:33,920
Omit, omit the blow.

803
00:34:34,640 --> 00:34:36,640
Just kiss that hand and pull it away a little bit,

804
00:34:36,640 --> 00:34:37,680
like Glenn would do.

805
00:34:38,640 --> 00:34:39,520
But is that the same?

806
00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:41,120
Does that still count as blowing a kiss?

807
00:34:41,120 --> 00:34:42,240
That's just, mwah.

808
00:34:42,240 --> 00:34:43,760
But it's not the, whew.

809
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:47,120
You know, does it still count as blowing a kiss if you are

810
00:34:47,120 --> 00:34:49,920
just kissing without the correspondent?

811
00:34:49,920 --> 00:34:51,920
Because then the kiss is just hanging in the air

812
00:34:51,920 --> 00:34:54,640
an inch in front of you until you blow it at them.

813
00:34:54,640 --> 00:34:56,800
There is a terrible risk that I had not calculated

814
00:34:56,800 --> 00:34:57,840
until this exact moment.

815
00:34:58,560 --> 00:35:02,560
If you're in a professional setting and you kiss your hand

816
00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:04,240
and then you blow the kiss over to the other person,

817
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:08,080
if they catch that kiss and put it on their cheek,

818
00:35:08,080 --> 00:35:11,200
they have just power played you so fucking bad

819
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:13,360
that you're probably going to have to like quit

820
00:35:13,360 --> 00:35:15,760
and give them your job and sign over the business to them

821
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:18,000
or something, depending on what your responsibilities are.

822
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:22,560
But you will never get the metaphorical ball back

823
00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:23,360
in that relationship.

824
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:26,000
You're going to have to butterfly kiss them

825
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:26,800
if that happens.

826
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:28,320
Yeah, that's your only option.

827
00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:31,600
Or what if they put it on their mouth?

828
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:33,680
You're fired.

829
00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:35,520
You've been fired at that point.

830
00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:36,160
You've been fired from your job.

831
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:38,720
Hey guys, I just really quick, because I do think

832
00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:39,600
we should go to the money zone.

833
00:35:39,600 --> 00:35:41,760
But I did just Google Glenn Close

834
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:43,360
and I'm looking at her Wikipedia page.

835
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:45,280
First of all, she's 69 years old.

836
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:45,780
Nice.

837
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:51,280
And on her Wikipedia page is,

838
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:52,240
and I'm not making this up,

839
00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:53,360
there's like in that little sidebar,

840
00:35:53,360 --> 00:35:56,480
it's like Glenn Close at the Albert Nobbs premiere in 2012.

841
00:35:56,480 --> 00:35:57,440
She looks amazing.

842
00:35:58,000 --> 00:35:59,840
Tells me all about her alma mater,

843
00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:03,840
her many spouses, her kid that she has, her parents.

844
00:36:03,840 --> 00:36:05,200
And then right under that is,

845
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:06,960
and you can Google this if you don't believe me,

846
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:08,720
just a picture of her signature.

847
00:36:08,720 --> 00:36:11,920
So I think I'm going to probably steal her identity, I guess.

848
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:12,160
Yeah.

849
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:14,080
Hi, I'm Glenn Close now.

850
00:36:14,080 --> 00:36:15,040
Catch me if you can.

851
00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:16,000
I'm Glenn Far.

852
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,720
Catch you if you can, Tom Hanks.

853
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:20,880
Because I'm Glenn Close now, motherfucker.

854
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:22,480
The name of this show could be changed to,

855
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:24,480
finally, to My Brother, My Brother, and Glenn.

856
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:27,760
Or Miss Close.

857
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:30,240
I mean, you'll make us call you Glenn Close.

858
00:36:31,040 --> 00:36:33,200
Yeah, 30 under 30 media luminary.

859
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:33,920
Glenn Close.

860
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:34,960
Glenn Close.

861
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:36,320
All right, let's go to the money zone.

862
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:48,400
Let's go to the money zone, I'm done.

863
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:50,400
Hey, can I tell you guys about Nature Box?

864
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:50,880
Hell yeah.

865
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:51,680
I wish you would.

866
00:36:52,240 --> 00:36:57,760
Because I'm on that bad, bad baby sleep schedule,

867
00:36:57,760 --> 00:37:00,080
and now I snack to survive.

868
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:05,200
Every, like, I eat those Big Island Pineapple,

869
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:09,120
like they are fucking rings from Sonic the Hedgehog,

870
00:37:09,120 --> 00:37:10,880
and they are actually keeping me alive.

871
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:16,560
It is a wonderful service where you go to naturebox.com

872
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:19,280
and you pick the snacks that you want off their list,

873
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:21,680
and then they just show up in a little,

874
00:37:21,680 --> 00:37:24,080
basically what is essentially a treasure chest

875
00:37:24,080 --> 00:37:25,520
that is sent to your house.

876
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:27,200
These snacks taste great and they're better for you.

877
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:28,640
They're made with high quality ingredients

878
00:37:28,640 --> 00:37:30,960
that are free from artificial colors, flavors, or sweeteners,

879
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:32,480
so you can feel great about snacking.

880
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:36,880
Um, like I said, Big Island Pineapple, pretty rad.

881
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:39,760
They got whole wheat raspberry figgy bars, love those.

882
00:37:40,560 --> 00:37:42,400
Salt and pepper pop pops.

883
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:44,720
Do you know what I would do if I were in Nature Box?

884
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:47,360
I think I would release, like, a companion snack

885
00:37:47,360 --> 00:37:49,680
called, like, Small Island Pineapple.

886
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:50,000
Oh, that's fun.

887
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:51,920
And it's like, you eat them together,

888
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:54,720
and, like, one makes you big and one makes you tiny.

889
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:56,880
Oh, so it's magic.

890
00:37:56,880 --> 00:37:58,000
Sorry, Justin, no.

891
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:00,640
Travis just floated magic food.

892
00:38:00,640 --> 00:38:04,000
Okay, I mean, that would be a good thing for them to sell.

893
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:06,320
Justin, you and I need to be more careful

894
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:09,200
because sometimes Travis floats things like magic food,

895
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:11,520
and we are like, oh, off to the next thing.

896
00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:12,000
Sounds good.

897
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:14,320
But I am curious, Travis,

898
00:38:15,600 --> 00:38:18,640
what other sort of magic food Nature Box has

899
00:38:18,640 --> 00:38:20,960
that they ship you that you know about

900
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:22,400
that they aren't talking about,

901
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:23,920
like the deep, like, government consumers and stuff.

902
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:26,160
They're afraid to let us know about.

903
00:38:26,160 --> 00:38:29,600
Yeah, I honestly, I'm afraid I've said too much.

904
00:38:29,600 --> 00:38:31,280
Oh, so you couldn't think of enough.

905
00:38:34,080 --> 00:38:35,600
Right now, you can save even more.

906
00:38:35,600 --> 00:38:38,240

911
00:38:46,640 --> 00:38:49,120
You did a really good job on that ad, Griffin.

912
00:38:49,120 --> 00:38:50,240
Thank you, dude.

913
00:38:50,240 --> 00:38:53,200
I think Travis probably was a little bit off his game

914
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:54,720
because he was literally tweeting

915
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:56,160
while we were doing that bit.

916
00:38:56,160 --> 00:38:58,160
Oh, boy, Justin, give me that.

917
00:38:58,160 --> 00:38:59,760
Justin, give me that good tweet he was doing.

918
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:03,280
I said that his goal is to get my bim bam verified.

919
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:03,920
Can I do that?

920
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:04,640
How do I do that?

921
00:39:04,640 --> 00:39:06,240
I still don't know how I got verified.

922
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:11,680
Jesus, that is a very, very, very good Travis McElroy tweet.

923
00:39:11,680 --> 00:39:15,360
Well, to be fair, I did tweet that during the lengthy break

924
00:39:15,360 --> 00:39:18,240
that we edited out where Justin ran to, I don't know,

925
00:39:18,240 --> 00:39:22,000
go to the bathroom, get coffee, check his, I don't know,

926
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,320
TV to see what was on Nickelodeon.

927
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:25,680
I didn't run to the bathroom.

928
00:39:25,680 --> 00:39:27,120
I'm not John Candy.

929
00:39:27,120 --> 00:39:28,800
I walked to the bathroom.

930
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:32,880
I'm not John Candy in every John Candy movie

931
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:35,360
where he uses the bathroom and has to run to it.

932
00:39:35,360 --> 00:39:38,480
I am a gentleman, and I walked to the restroom

933
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:39,440
to devastate it.

934
00:39:41,120 --> 00:39:44,240
I want to tell you guys about another sponsor,

935
00:39:44,240 --> 00:39:45,120
and it's Harry's.

936
00:39:45,840 --> 00:39:48,160
We've talked about Harry's many times,

937
00:39:48,160 --> 00:39:52,160
but I love the fact that the razors don't cost.

938
00:39:53,120 --> 00:39:55,680
I was just looking through the razor section today.

939
00:39:55,680 --> 00:39:57,680
Do you know they sell an eight-pack, one of the big companies

940
00:39:57,680 --> 00:40:00,960
sells an eight-pack of razors for $45?

941
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:01,680
Yes.

942
00:40:01,680 --> 00:40:03,840
It's lunacy.

943
00:40:03,840 --> 00:40:05,040
It's lunacy.

944
00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:06,000
I love Harry's.

945
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:10,400
Harry's is the only reasonable razor company in the whole world,

946
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:12,880
but there's something kind of so dope about that.

947
00:40:12,880 --> 00:40:14,560
Like, yeah, eight razors.

948
00:40:14,560 --> 00:40:16,400
You'll use them in like two months.

949
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:18,000
$40, please.

950
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:19,760
What are you talking about, shit?

951
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:20,240
Yeah.

952
00:40:20,240 --> 00:40:20,880
What the fuck?

953
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:24,320
I shouldn't have to have a budget line item for razors.

954
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:27,200
That shouldn't be listed among my utilities,

955
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:28,320
and now I don't have to.

956
00:40:28,320 --> 00:40:33,360
They're just $2 a blade compared to the $4 or $5 or $6

957
00:40:33,360 --> 00:40:34,720
that you'll pay at the drugstore.

958
00:40:34,720 --> 00:40:35,280
Yeah.

959
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:40,640
What if Downey was like eight rolls of paper towels?

960
00:40:40,640 --> 00:40:42,240
That'll be $160.

961
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:43,760
Fuck you.

962
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:44,880
All their products are great, too.

963
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:46,240
Their aftershave is the best I've ever used.

964
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:50,240
Now, Harry's is so confident about the quality of their blades.

965
00:40:50,240 --> 00:40:52,800
They want you to try their shave set for free.

966
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:53,440
You heard that right.

967
00:40:53,440 --> 00:40:55,200
Just cover shipping when you sign up.

968
00:40:55,200 --> 00:40:57,520
Plus, as a special offer for fans of our show,

969
00:40:57,520 --> 00:41:00,400

970

MYBROTHER at checkout, and you get a post-shave balm also free.

971
00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:06,640
It's the best.

972
00:41:06,640 --> 00:41:09,840
And you can get it for free going to harrys.com

973
00:41:09,840 --> 00:41:13,280
and using the code MYBROTHER when you sign up.

974
00:41:15,120 --> 00:41:16,320
I want to tell y'all.

975
00:41:16,320 --> 00:41:17,360
No, I want to.

976
00:41:18,560 --> 00:41:18,960
Okay.

977
00:41:19,600 --> 00:41:19,920
Okay.

978
00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:21,280
Do you know what?

979
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:24,080
You got to do the thing with the snacks,

980
00:41:24,080 --> 00:41:25,200
and now I want to do this one.

981
00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:26,400
I don't want to do it.

982
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:32,400
Listen, we only get to do this ad twice a year

983
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:34,320
in the two weeks leading up to Valentine's Day.

984
00:41:34,320 --> 00:41:34,720
So let's just-

985
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:35,200
I know.

986
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:35,680
Come on.

987
00:41:36,560 --> 00:41:37,120
It's okay.

988
00:41:37,120 --> 00:41:38,240
Go do it, Travis.

989
00:41:40,080 --> 00:41:46,560
I don't want to do it anymore.

990
00:41:46,560 --> 00:41:49,040
I don't know why the sound of my little brother crying

991
00:41:49,040 --> 00:41:50,240
makes me so happy.

992
00:41:50,240 --> 00:41:57,520
I just feel like I've been looking forward to it.

993
00:41:58,640 --> 00:42:01,280
You know folks, Valentine's Day is just around the corner

994
00:42:01,280 --> 00:42:05,440
and ProFlowers is making it easier than ever

995
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:08,080
by taking out the guesswork.

996
00:42:08,080 --> 00:42:09,680
On top of their already low prices,

997
00:42:09,680 --> 00:42:12,400
right now you can get two dozen assorted roses

998
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:16,800
with a free glass vase for $29.99

999
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:19,360
plus shipping and handling or upgrade

1000
00:42:19,360 --> 00:42:20,720
for another $9.99.

1001
00:42:20,720 --> 00:42:22,960
You can get two dozen long stem roses

1002
00:42:22,960 --> 00:42:25,760
with premium vase and chocolate.

1003
00:42:26,960 --> 00:42:28,320
You can pick your flowers

1004
00:42:28,320 --> 00:42:29,840
and then check it out in two minutes.

1005
00:42:30,880 --> 00:42:33,120
This hasn't happened this year,

1006
00:42:33,120 --> 00:42:34,000
but last year,

1007
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:35,840
the first time ProFlowers advertised with us,

1008
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:38,480
they wanted to send us a sample of their product,

1009
00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:39,520
which I thought was great.

1010
00:42:40,720 --> 00:42:42,800
And they showed up and it was beautiful,

1011
00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:43,920
just beautiful flowers.

1012
00:42:43,920 --> 00:42:46,160
And you wouldn't believe these came in a box.

1013
00:42:46,160 --> 00:42:47,040
This is fantastic.

1014
00:42:47,040 --> 00:42:47,840
No, they're really, really-

1015
00:42:47,840 --> 00:42:48,720
They're really pretty.

1016
00:42:48,720 --> 00:42:49,440
Nice to have around.

1017
00:42:49,440 --> 00:42:50,640
Except the one thing-

1018
00:42:50,640 --> 00:42:51,600
There's one thing.

1019
00:42:51,600 --> 00:42:52,400
There's one problem.

1020
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:53,840
The one problem is they send them

1021
00:42:53,840 --> 00:42:55,440
for all the podcasts I do.

1022
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:57,520
So all of a sudden it went from like,

1023
00:42:57,520 --> 00:42:58,800
oh, beautiful flowers to,

1024
00:42:58,800 --> 00:43:00,720
holy shit, I'm getting stalked.

1025
00:43:00,720 --> 00:43:03,680
Fucking Max Medina is about to propose to me.

1026
00:43:03,680 --> 00:43:06,320
He's just fucking packing my house with roses

1027
00:43:06,320 --> 00:43:11,200
and it got to be a little bit of a burden.

1028
00:43:11,200 --> 00:43:13,040
It got to be a little bit burdensome,

1029
00:43:13,040 --> 00:43:13,920
but they're gorgeous.

1030
00:43:13,920 --> 00:43:14,560
They're all gorgeous.

1031
00:43:14,560 --> 00:43:15,760
They're gorgeous flowers.

1032
00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:16,080
For me-

1033
00:43:16,080 --> 00:43:19,200
But it did make it seem like Justin had just died.

1034
00:43:19,200 --> 00:43:20,000
When it happened to me,

1035
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:21,440
I felt that this must be what it's like

1036
00:43:21,440 --> 00:43:23,040
to fake your own death.

1037
00:43:23,040 --> 00:43:27,040
You get to see the flowers people send to the family.

1038
00:43:27,040 --> 00:43:29,040
I'm like, oh, ProFlowers really cares

1039
00:43:29,040 --> 00:43:30,080
that I faked my death.

1040
00:43:30,080 --> 00:43:31,120
Thank you, ProFlowers.

1041
00:43:32,240 --> 00:43:33,680
Here's the only way to get two dozen assorted

This deal expires soon.

1051
00:43:46,560 --> 00:43:48,320
Can I read the fucking Jumbotron at least?

1052
00:43:48,320 --> 00:43:48,960
Sure, yeah.

1053
00:43:48,960 --> 00:43:49,440
Go for it.

1054
00:43:50,080 --> 00:43:51,280
Who is this message for?

1055
00:43:51,280 --> 00:43:53,840
It's for Anna, aka Traveler.

1056
00:43:53,840 --> 00:43:55,200
You're not even gonna read the thing right.

1057
00:43:55,760 --> 00:43:56,480
And it's from-

1058
00:43:56,480 --> 00:43:58,640
You're not even gonna do the impression.

1059
00:43:58,640 --> 00:44:02,960
And it's from Rosie, aka Potion Seller.

1060
00:44:03,520 --> 00:44:04,400
Potion Seller.

1061
00:44:06,560 --> 00:44:09,120
Greetings, Traveler.

1062
00:44:09,120 --> 00:44:10,160
Potion Seller.

1063
00:44:10,160 --> 00:44:10,960
You see that video?

1064
00:44:10,960 --> 00:44:11,840
It's fucking good.

1065
00:44:11,840 --> 00:44:14,240
See, you don't even know the fucking meme.

1066
00:44:14,240 --> 00:44:16,720
Listen up, big man on campus, Travis McElroy.

1067
00:44:16,720 --> 00:44:17,760
I know all the memes.

1068
00:44:20,080 --> 00:44:22,640
Potion Seller is Traveler.

1069
00:44:22,640 --> 00:44:23,440
You see that?

1070
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:27,840
Man, I used to get blazed and just fucking roll that shit.

1071
00:44:28,400 --> 00:44:30,400
Roll that beautiful beam footage.

1072
00:44:30,400 --> 00:44:31,920
Surprise, by now it's been-

1073
00:44:31,920 --> 00:44:33,200
Sorry, this is now the message.

1074
00:44:33,200 --> 00:44:35,280
Surprise, by now it's been several months

1075
00:44:35,280 --> 00:44:36,960
since I introduced you to Mimba Mim.

1076
00:44:37,600 --> 00:44:39,600
Just don't know why it came out like that.

1077
00:44:39,600 --> 00:44:42,240
And you, like a woman possessed,

1078
00:44:42,240 --> 00:44:43,840
tore through the first hundred episodes

1079
00:44:43,840 --> 00:44:44,960
in a matter of days.

1080
00:44:44,960 --> 00:44:47,520
Those saw bones is your true podcast soulmate.

1081
00:44:47,520 --> 00:44:49,760
Thanks for being there for me during my year off.

1082
00:44:49,760 --> 00:44:51,920
I'm so glad to be back on campus with you.

1083
00:44:51,920 --> 00:44:53,120
Happy 21st, Anna.

1084
00:44:53,120 --> 00:44:53,620
Great job.

1085
00:44:54,400 --> 00:44:56,160
I'd like to say to Rosie,

1086
00:44:56,160 --> 00:44:56,640
thank you-

1087
00:44:56,640 --> 00:44:57,840
That's a beautiful message.

1088
00:44:57,840 --> 00:44:59,440
Thank you for right in the middle there,

1089
00:44:59,440 --> 00:45:01,280
making sure to let us know

1090
00:45:01,280 --> 00:45:03,120
that we are Anna's second favorite.

1091
00:45:03,920 --> 00:45:04,880
Hey, I'll take it.

1092
00:45:04,880 --> 00:45:05,200
Fine.

1093
00:45:06,240 --> 00:45:06,720
Yeah.

1094
00:45:06,720 --> 00:45:07,280
Fine.

1095
00:45:07,280 --> 00:45:09,760
Are there like Terrace House fan casts?

1096
00:45:09,760 --> 00:45:10,240
There is.

1097
00:45:10,240 --> 00:45:12,880
Nick Robinson at Polygon just started doing one.

1098
00:45:12,880 --> 00:45:13,120
Nice.

1099
00:45:13,120 --> 00:45:14,320
Um, yeah.

1100
00:45:14,320 --> 00:45:14,960
I don't know.

1101
00:45:14,960 --> 00:45:16,880
Spoilers, I haven't finished Aloha State,

1102
00:45:16,880 --> 00:45:18,560
but it's popping off though.

1103
00:45:18,560 --> 00:45:20,000
There's only eight Eps, right?

1104
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:20,560
Right now?

1105
00:45:20,560 --> 00:45:20,880
Yeah.

1106
00:45:21,760 --> 00:45:22,880
We're really pacing ourselves

1107
00:45:22,880 --> 00:45:24,800
because we blew through season one.

1108
00:45:24,800 --> 00:45:27,840
Welcome to our segment Terrace House break

1109
00:45:27,840 --> 00:45:29,840
where we talk about Terrace House.

1110
00:45:29,840 --> 00:45:30,560
Yeah.

1111
00:45:30,560 --> 00:45:31,760
My dad asked me this week,

1112
00:45:31,760 --> 00:45:32,560
what's Terrace House?

1113
00:45:32,560 --> 00:45:36,080
Because he took a fucking covert snap of me

1114
00:45:36,080 --> 00:45:37,600
during Adventures in Recording where I was wearing

1115
00:45:37,600 --> 00:45:39,920
the beautiful Terrace House shirt

1116
00:45:39,920 --> 00:45:43,600
that I received for Christmas from my dear brother.

1117
00:45:43,600 --> 00:45:45,360
And people were going nuts about it.

1118
00:45:45,360 --> 00:45:47,200
My dad asked me, what's Terrace House?

1119
00:45:47,200 --> 00:45:48,720
And that, it was a real,

1120
00:45:49,680 --> 00:45:51,840
I didn't know how to explain Terrace House to my dad

1121
00:45:51,840 --> 00:45:53,280
in a way that would make it appealing enough

1122
00:45:53,280 --> 00:45:54,000
that he would watch it,

1123
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:55,600
which everybody should, on Earth.

1124
00:45:57,360 --> 00:45:58,400
I'm Allegra Ringo.

1125
00:45:58,400 --> 00:45:59,440
And I'm Renee Colbert.

1126
00:45:59,440 --> 00:46:02,160
And we host a podcast called Can I Pet Your Dog?

1127
00:46:02,160 --> 00:46:04,240
Renee, can I tell you about a dog I met this week?

1128
00:46:04,240 --> 00:46:05,200
I wish that you would.

1129
00:46:05,200 --> 00:46:07,760
In turn though, can I tell you about a dog hero?

1130
00:46:07,760 --> 00:46:09,520
May I tell you about a dog breed

1131
00:46:09,520 --> 00:46:11,360
in a segment I like to call Mutt Minute?

1132
00:46:11,360 --> 00:46:12,560
I would love that.

1133
00:46:12,560 --> 00:46:14,400
Could we maybe talk about some dog tech?

1134
00:46:14,400 --> 00:46:15,920
Could we have some cool guests on?

1135
00:46:15,920 --> 00:46:18,880
Like Lin-Manuel Miranda, Nicole Byer, and Anne Wheaton?

1136
00:46:18,880 --> 00:46:20,960
I mean, yeah, absolutely.

1137
00:46:20,960 --> 00:46:21,360
I'm in.

1138
00:46:21,360 --> 00:46:22,000
You're on board.

1139
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:23,760
What do you say we do all of this

1140
00:46:23,760 --> 00:46:25,120
and put it into a podcast?

1141
00:46:25,120 --> 00:46:25,680
Yeah, okay.

1142
00:46:25,680 --> 00:46:26,400
You think?

1143
00:46:26,400 --> 00:46:26,900
Perfect.

1144
00:46:27,520 --> 00:46:28,640
Should we call it like, I don't know,

1145
00:46:28,640 --> 00:46:29,760
Can I Pet Your Dog?

1146
00:46:29,760 --> 00:46:30,240
Sure.

1147
00:46:30,240 --> 00:46:30,640
All right.

1148
00:46:31,520 --> 00:46:34,480
What do you say we put it on every Tuesday on Maximum Fun?

1149
00:46:34,480 --> 00:46:35,600
Or on iTunes.

1150
00:46:35,600 --> 00:46:36,480
Sounds good to me.

1151
00:46:36,480 --> 00:46:37,200
Meeting's over.

1152
00:46:40,560 --> 00:46:41,600
I have a Yahoo here.

1153
00:46:41,600 --> 00:46:42,160
Can I read it?

1154
00:46:43,440 --> 00:46:44,160
Yeah, go for it.

1155
00:46:44,160 --> 00:46:44,720
Okay.

1156
00:46:44,720 --> 00:46:45,200
You're the boss.

1157
00:46:46,320 --> 00:46:46,560
What?

1158
00:46:46,560 --> 00:46:47,120
You're the boss.

1159
00:46:47,840 --> 00:46:48,160
Oh, okay.

1160
00:46:48,160 --> 00:46:49,120
You're a media luminary.

1161
00:46:49,120 --> 00:46:50,560
If you feel like it's time for a Yahoo,

1162
00:46:50,560 --> 00:46:51,120
you should go for it.

1163
00:46:51,120 --> 00:46:52,000
That's a fucking good point.

1164
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:53,040
I'm just gonna drop it then.

1165
00:46:53,040 --> 00:46:54,400
It's also from Brooks Oglesby.

1166
00:46:54,400 --> 00:46:54,880
Thank you, Brooks.

1167
00:46:54,880 --> 00:46:57,200
It's by Yahoo Answers user, Rose, who asks,

1168
00:46:57,840 --> 00:47:00,560
I bet no one has asked this one before.

1169
00:47:00,560 --> 00:47:04,080
What rides at an amusement park are best for kissing?

1170
00:47:08,080 --> 00:47:09,920
You know, Rose?

1171
00:47:09,920 --> 00:47:15,040
Do you guys remember having to find places to kiss?

1172
00:47:16,240 --> 00:47:16,960
This will be a good...

1173
00:47:16,960 --> 00:47:17,600
This will be...

1174
00:47:17,600 --> 00:47:22,640
You'd be like walking in the park and you'd find like a little secluded grove

1175
00:47:23,120 --> 00:47:27,040
and you'd think like, I should remember this for later for when I want to kiss.

1176
00:47:27,040 --> 00:47:31,040
Yes, my good one was the instrument room in the band room,

1177
00:47:31,040 --> 00:47:34,160
like the instrument closet is a good place to kiss.

1178
00:47:34,160 --> 00:47:35,680
That's a good place to kiss.

1179
00:47:35,680 --> 00:47:37,040
Hmm, good kissing in there.

1180
00:47:37,040 --> 00:47:42,560
I will never forget being a teen and going on a date to a movie

1181
00:47:42,560 --> 00:47:45,440
and sitting in the back row so I can do some smooching

1182
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:50,640
and then some fucking adults would come and sit like right in front of us

1183
00:47:50,640 --> 00:47:54,160
and it's like, I think you guys know exactly what you just did.

1184
00:47:54,160 --> 00:47:54,960
You've ruined me.

1185
00:47:54,960 --> 00:47:57,760
I think that you're being assholes right now.

1186
00:47:58,640 --> 00:48:02,400
Do you think I wanted to see Prince of Egypt in theaters?

1187
00:48:02,400 --> 00:48:05,200
No, I came here for a reason and that was to kiss

1188
00:48:05,200 --> 00:48:06,480
and to listen to Donny Osmond sing.

1189
00:48:06,480 --> 00:48:07,200
He's got a great voice.

1190
00:48:08,560 --> 00:48:10,400
What are the best rides at an amusement park though?

1191
00:48:10,400 --> 00:48:12,240
Because Tunnel of Love is obvious bullshit.

1192
00:48:12,240 --> 00:48:14,480
If you kiss on the Tunnel of Love, it's like so...

1193
00:48:14,480 --> 00:48:19,280
Like if my wife kissed me on a Tunnel of Love, I'd be like, really?

1194
00:48:19,280 --> 00:48:22,480
Okay, stop, stop.

1195
00:48:22,480 --> 00:48:24,320
Stop, this needs to be addressed.

1196
00:48:25,440 --> 00:48:27,760
My first thought was the Tunnel of Love, right?

1197
00:48:27,760 --> 00:48:29,920
Okay, but stop for a second and think.

1198
00:48:29,920 --> 00:48:33,440
Oh my God, holy shit, Justin, you're right.

1199
00:48:34,160 --> 00:48:38,560
Seriously though, media has perpetrated a lot of lies on us growing up as kids,

1200
00:48:38,560 --> 00:48:40,400
especially like old cartoons.

1201
00:48:40,400 --> 00:48:46,800
I've never in my entire adult life, I've traveled all across this great land of ours.

1202
00:48:46,800 --> 00:48:50,400
I've never, ever, ever seen a Tunnel of Love.

1203
00:48:50,400 --> 00:48:54,880
I've seen a fake Mario Brothers castle that kids could run around on and fall and die.

1204
00:48:55,680 --> 00:48:59,920
I've seen a spaceship that spins around so fast that you stick to the walls.

1205
00:48:59,920 --> 00:49:03,440
I've never seen a Tunnel of Love in my entire life.

1206
00:49:03,440 --> 00:49:09,120
Essentially what a Tunnel of Love is, is a timed hand job challenge.

1207
00:49:10,720 --> 00:49:12,240
Are you tough enough?

1208
00:49:12,240 --> 00:49:13,440
You have a hot jacket.

1209
00:49:14,080 --> 00:49:16,480
You have 118 seconds, go.

1210
00:49:16,480 --> 00:49:19,840
Uh oh, look up ahead, do you hear the clown music?

1211
00:49:20,640 --> 00:49:23,280
You better hurry, you better hurry and finish to the clown music.

1212
00:49:24,160 --> 00:49:25,520
That's when the camera flashes.

1213
00:49:27,680 --> 00:49:28,880
Do you want to buy your pictures?

1214
00:49:28,880 --> 00:49:31,040
I don't, please don't show the pictures.

1215
00:49:33,920 --> 00:49:37,120
I think some real next level smooching would happen on bumper cars,

1216
00:49:37,120 --> 00:49:39,280
but here's the thing, two separate cars.

1217
00:49:42,640 --> 00:49:44,160
You have to bump to smooch.

1218
00:49:44,160 --> 00:49:48,960
Okay, it's kind of like that scene in Fast Five, or maybe Fast Six,

1219
00:49:49,520 --> 00:49:54,240
where Vin catches Letty in the air, and because their cars crash into each other.

1220
00:49:54,240 --> 00:49:54,960
Or something like that.

1221
00:49:54,960 --> 00:50:00,240
Or like that scene, I think it's Fast Five, where the Rock and Vin Diesel pull up next to each other and smooch.

1222
00:50:00,240 --> 00:50:03,280
And they kiss, they crash their cars into each other and like, you want to fight?

1223
00:50:03,280 --> 00:50:07,600
Like, no, I have a better idea, and they do kiss right there.

1224
00:50:09,040 --> 00:50:11,680
Man, why did Izzy turn evil though?

1225
00:50:11,680 --> 00:50:14,240
I'm still so torn up inside about it.

1226
00:50:14,240 --> 00:50:15,440
It was about family.

1227
00:50:15,440 --> 00:50:18,400
It was about family, but it's not anymore.

1228
00:50:19,200 --> 00:50:20,400
Damn it, damn it.

1229
00:50:20,400 --> 00:50:21,280
Here's a question.

1230
00:50:21,280 --> 00:50:21,760
What's a-

1231
00:50:21,760 --> 00:50:22,800
I got another question.

1232
00:50:22,800 --> 00:50:23,280
Okay.

1233
00:50:23,280 --> 00:50:25,520
Did you have something else you wanted to say about Fast and the Furious?

1234
00:50:25,520 --> 00:50:28,160
I've always wanted to talk about Fast and the Furious on our podcast, so-

1235
00:50:28,160 --> 00:50:32,000
No, but there's so many different rides in an amusement park where you could kiss on.

1236
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:35,360
I think the best one would be at Universal Studios, the Fast and the Furious.

1237
00:50:35,360 --> 00:50:40,400
There's a part in the tram ride, where it's like, hey, here's this used to be,

1238
00:50:40,400 --> 00:50:46,000
this used to be where we filmed Desperate Housewives, and here's the back lot where we film all of our street scenes.

1239
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:49,920
And now, oh, it's Dominic Toretto and gang, and they're with us.

1240
00:50:49,920 --> 00:50:50,400
What's that?

1241
00:50:50,400 --> 00:50:52,080
There's a bad guy trying to catch us.

1242
00:50:52,080 --> 00:50:55,120
We're in a tram, but it's souped up, and let's take a ju-

1243
00:50:55,120 --> 00:50:56,320
It's like, whoa, hold on.

1244
00:50:56,320 --> 00:51:02,080
It's weird how they do that at Universal, and they're like, here we are, and there's the lot where we filmed whatever the fuck.

1245
00:51:02,080 --> 00:51:04,320
And here was some bad movie that we filmed here.

1246
00:51:04,320 --> 00:51:05,920
And then, oh, what's that?

1247
00:51:05,920 --> 00:51:08,080
The tram's in the middle of a flood.

1248
00:51:08,080 --> 00:51:10,000
And it's like, no, you can't-

1249
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:10,560
That doesn't make sense.

1250
00:51:10,560 --> 00:51:14,080
Be like, here's a tour of Universal, and then you're in, you're imperiled.

1251
00:51:14,080 --> 00:51:16,960
They also have that studio tour at Universal Studios Florida.

1252
00:51:16,960 --> 00:51:18,960
Nothing is filmed there.

1253
00:51:18,960 --> 00:51:19,680
Nothing is there.

1254
00:51:19,680 --> 00:51:20,640
You're not gonna see any celebs.

1255
00:51:21,440 --> 00:51:24,000
There's Duck Dynasty, and end of tour.

1256
00:51:24,720 --> 00:51:27,520
I, when I, when Teresa and I went to the Universal Studios,

1257
00:51:27,520 --> 00:51:31,440
somebody got very excited because there was, like, a board, like, posted on a wall

1258
00:51:31,440 --> 00:51:35,760
that showed what TV shows are filmed at that studio, and one of them was, like, Mindy Project.

1259
00:51:35,760 --> 00:51:39,120
And I saw this family lose their fucking minds,

1260
00:51:39,120 --> 00:51:41,680
but they were like, they filmed Mindy Project here.

1261
00:51:41,680 --> 00:51:43,360
And I was like, not here, though.

1262
00:51:43,360 --> 00:51:46,080
Like, not in a place you're going to go.

1263
00:51:46,080 --> 00:51:47,040
Where's Mindy?

1264
00:51:47,040 --> 00:51:48,800
Why are you so excited?

1265
00:51:48,800 --> 00:51:48,880
Mindy!

1266
00:51:48,880 --> 00:51:52,400
It might as well have said, like, this is where we film Cheers.

1267
00:51:52,400 --> 00:51:55,760
Like, here, like, yeah, you're not gonna see it.

1268
00:51:55,760 --> 00:51:57,200
They don't have to prove that to you.

1269
00:51:57,200 --> 00:52:01,040
Yeah, you say that, but when we took the NBC studio tour, when we went up in the AH,

1270
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:03,680
you know we were losing it.

1271
00:52:03,680 --> 00:52:04,960
You know we were fucking out.

1272
00:52:04,960 --> 00:52:05,680
That is true.

1273
00:52:05,680 --> 00:52:10,720
Thinking about, that's where fucking Brian Fellowes had done his thing.

1274
00:52:11,280 --> 00:52:15,200
And the fucking, if you think about it, if you think about it for a second, Travis,

1275
00:52:15,200 --> 00:52:21,200
studio AH is where I said a bottle of sparkling apple juice to your house,

1276
00:52:21,200 --> 00:52:21,760
did you get it?

1277
00:52:21,760 --> 00:52:23,760
It was actually filmed, if you think about it.

1278
00:52:25,440 --> 00:52:27,200
This is like when I went to Nickelodeon Studios,

1279
00:52:27,200 --> 00:52:30,640
and they let us walk onto the set of the mystery Files of Shelby Woo.

1280
00:52:30,640 --> 00:52:34,000
Uh, I want to get to this last question, because it's so fucking good.

1281
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:34,560
Please.

1282
00:52:34,560 --> 00:52:37,600
My dad admitted to me that he had never seen Willy Wonka.

1283
00:52:40,240 --> 00:52:42,720
Now here, then it gets more buck wild.

1284
00:52:42,720 --> 00:52:43,920
Oh my god!

1285
00:52:43,920 --> 00:52:48,400
He's a huge fan of Gene Wilder, so I told him to watch it.

1286
00:52:49,120 --> 00:52:51,680
After a year trying to get him to watch Willy Wonka,

1287
00:52:51,680 --> 00:52:54,720
I finally bought him a Blu-ray player with a copy of Willy Wonka.

1288
00:52:54,720 --> 00:52:56,480
That was three years ago.

1289
00:52:56,480 --> 00:52:59,200
Every time I see him, I beg him to watch Willy Wonka.

1290
00:52:59,200 --> 00:53:02,800
And he watches reruns of M.A.S.H. and Big Bang Theory instead.

1291
00:53:02,800 --> 00:53:04,160
You guys are my last hope.

1292
00:53:04,160 --> 00:53:06,720
How do I convince you to watch this movie?

1293
00:53:06,720 --> 00:53:10,560
Oh my god, this is all time.

1294
00:53:10,560 --> 00:53:13,760
And in fact, a question I didn't include in the list here,

1295
00:53:13,760 --> 00:53:16,880
but in the email also included their dad's phone number,

1296
00:53:16,880 --> 00:53:19,200
so we could call their dad, I guess,

1297
00:53:19,200 --> 00:53:22,240
ostensibly call their dad to tell their dad,

1298
00:53:22,240 --> 00:53:24,320
hey, we're three people you don't know,

1299
00:53:24,320 --> 00:53:26,320
but fucking watch Willy Wonka, old man.

1300
00:53:26,320 --> 00:53:28,480
Yeah, please watch Willy Wonka for a second.

1301
00:53:28,480 --> 00:53:34,000
This is fucking stellar.

1302
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:35,360
Are you kidding me?

1303
00:53:35,360 --> 00:53:36,800
This is the best question.

1304
00:53:37,440 --> 00:53:39,280
I love Vin Diesel.

1305
00:53:39,280 --> 00:53:40,800
Oh yeah, man, Fast and Furious.

1306
00:53:40,800 --> 00:53:42,160
Fast and the Who now?

1307
00:53:42,160 --> 00:53:44,000
Well, I'm more of a boiler room kind of guy.

1308
00:53:45,360 --> 00:53:46,480
Holy shit.

1309
00:53:47,760 --> 00:53:49,200
Huge fan of Gene Wilder.

1310
00:53:49,200 --> 00:53:51,360
Haven't seen the Willy Wonka movie,

1311
00:53:51,360 --> 00:53:53,920
but the Frisco kid is awesome.

1312
00:53:53,920 --> 00:53:54,880
Now, I will say this.

1313
00:53:54,880 --> 00:53:55,360
Great flick.

1314
00:53:55,360 --> 00:53:56,960
Gene Wilder does have a body of work

1315
00:53:56,960 --> 00:53:59,120
where you could conceivably be a huge fan of the man

1316
00:53:59,120 --> 00:54:00,160
and not see Willy Wonka.

1317
00:54:00,160 --> 00:54:02,240
I don't want to disparage his other work,

1318
00:54:02,240 --> 00:54:04,000
like fucking the-

1319
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:05,840
Frisco kid rules, that's fair.

1320
00:54:06,560 --> 00:54:08,720
Yeah, like he basically rules and everything.

1321
00:54:08,720 --> 00:54:10,480
Like fucking watch Silver Streak

1322
00:54:10,480 --> 00:54:12,560
and don't come away a huge fan of Gene Wilder.

1323
00:54:12,560 --> 00:54:13,600
It's literally impossible.

1324
00:54:15,040 --> 00:54:18,240
But the difference here is that all holds true

1325
00:54:18,240 --> 00:54:20,560
the first time you bring it up to your dad

1326
00:54:20,560 --> 00:54:22,560
and you're like, so what about Willy Wonka?

1327
00:54:22,560 --> 00:54:23,280
And he's like, what?

1328
00:54:23,280 --> 00:54:24,800
And you're like, Willy Wonka?

1329
00:54:24,800 --> 00:54:28,400
A movie that like is an amazing character study

1330
00:54:28,400 --> 00:54:29,520
like by Gene Wilder.

1331
00:54:29,520 --> 00:54:32,000
It's like an acting class to watch this.

1332
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:33,440
And you're like, oh, okay, cool.

1333
00:54:33,440 --> 00:54:34,400
Never gonna watch it.

1334
00:54:34,400 --> 00:54:34,720
It's like-

1335
00:54:34,720 --> 00:54:35,680
Love the man's work.

1336
00:54:35,680 --> 00:54:37,840
It's like arguably like between,

1337
00:54:38,800 --> 00:54:41,360
I would say between Heath Ledger's Joker

1338
00:54:41,360 --> 00:54:44,400
and Gene Wilder's Willy Wonka

1339
00:54:44,400 --> 00:54:46,800
for like literally the best performance

1340
00:54:46,800 --> 00:54:50,400
by any actor in any movie, literally ever.

1341
00:54:50,400 --> 00:54:52,000
Like I don't think there's a better one.

1342
00:54:52,560 --> 00:54:53,680
Heath Ledger's Joker,

1343
00:54:53,680 --> 00:54:55,120
Jared Leto's Joker.

1344
00:54:55,120 --> 00:54:57,840
And then right there, three with the bullet.

1345
00:54:58,560 --> 00:54:59,520
Gene Wilder's Joker.

1346
00:55:00,320 --> 00:55:02,400
He would have been fucking great at doing me.

1347
00:55:02,400 --> 00:55:03,600
Oh my God.

1348
00:55:03,600 --> 00:55:04,640
God, that would have been good.

1349
00:55:05,760 --> 00:55:06,720
He would have been Riddler.

1350
00:55:06,720 --> 00:55:08,080
He would have been an amazing Riddler.

1351
00:55:08,080 --> 00:55:10,080
Oh my God, Trace, that's even better.

1352
00:55:11,040 --> 00:55:12,320
Or Clock King.

1353
00:55:12,320 --> 00:55:14,080
Man, that motherfucker could have been any of them.

1354
00:55:14,080 --> 00:55:15,920
It could have been a calendar man.

1355
00:55:15,920 --> 00:55:17,120
Fucking, he could have been Batman.

1356
00:55:17,120 --> 00:55:20,480
He could have been, this is my 65 year old ward Robin.

1357
00:55:20,480 --> 00:55:24,080
Hello, Batman, the Batman future show.

1358
00:55:25,360 --> 00:55:25,840
Damn it.

1359
00:55:26,960 --> 00:55:29,120
Just put the movie.

1360
00:55:29,120 --> 00:55:30,160
Just put it on.

1361
00:55:30,160 --> 00:55:33,360
Just strap your dad in, fucking Clockwork Orange, your dad.

1362
00:55:33,360 --> 00:55:36,160
Now make him watch this culturally important film.

1363
00:55:36,160 --> 00:55:38,560
It is going to be a weird 20 minutes

1364
00:55:38,560 --> 00:55:39,360
where your dad's like,

1365
00:55:39,920 --> 00:55:42,080
it's just old people in a bed.

1366
00:55:43,120 --> 00:55:43,760
No, listen.

1367
00:55:44,400 --> 00:55:46,000
Why is this kid so sad?

1368
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:47,920
He's buying so much chocolate.

1369
00:55:47,920 --> 00:55:50,720
Okay, hang in there.

1370
00:55:50,720 --> 00:55:51,840
You're going to love this movie, Dad.

1371
00:55:51,840 --> 00:55:52,800
There's so much candy.

1372
00:55:52,800 --> 00:55:54,640
I've been watching it for 20 minutes.

1373
00:55:54,640 --> 00:55:56,160
Not even seen a single sweet.

1374
00:55:58,160 --> 00:55:59,840
Where's the sweets kid?

1375
00:55:59,840 --> 00:56:02,240
This kid in front of a TV, what the fuck?

1376
00:56:02,240 --> 00:56:03,520
There's a very spoiled girl,

1377
00:56:03,520 --> 00:56:05,200
but where's the sweets, Jamie?

1378
00:56:06,400 --> 00:56:08,240
Where's my Gene?

1379
00:56:08,240 --> 00:56:10,960
There has been very little of my favorite actor,

1380
00:56:10,960 --> 00:56:12,640
Gene Wilder from the Frisco Kids.

1381
00:56:12,640 --> 00:56:14,560
I went and showed him the movie and he said,

1382
00:56:14,560 --> 00:56:18,560
oh, Gene Wilder, I was thinking of somebody else.

1383
00:56:18,560 --> 00:56:20,000
I was thinking of Gene Hackman.

1384
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:20,960
Love that guy's work.

1385
00:56:20,960 --> 00:56:22,400
I love Gene Hackman's stuff.

1386
00:56:22,400 --> 00:56:25,440
Fucking tail wag dog or whatever.

1387
00:56:27,120 --> 00:56:28,480
Wag the dog, the tail.

1388
00:56:29,280 --> 00:56:30,640
Love him, he in that probably.

1389
00:56:30,640 --> 00:56:33,680
The problem with watching it for the first time,

1390
00:56:33,680 --> 00:56:35,840
sight unseen, is there's a chance he'll think

1391
00:56:35,840 --> 00:56:37,920
Arthur Slugworth is the protagonist

1392
00:56:37,920 --> 00:56:39,920
and he'll start rooting for him from the job.

1393
00:56:39,920 --> 00:56:42,000
I like the look of this Slugworth guy.

1394
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:43,920
He's got goals, priorities.

1395
00:56:43,920 --> 00:56:45,360
He's a mover and a shaker.

1396
00:56:46,480 --> 00:56:48,640
For some reason, I look and sound like him.

1397
00:56:49,920 --> 00:56:53,040
Do you think Mike TV's last name was TV

1398
00:56:53,040 --> 00:56:54,800
or that was just a nickname they called him

1399
00:56:54,800 --> 00:56:55,680
because he liked TV?

1400
00:56:55,680 --> 00:56:59,280
His last name is T-E-E-V-E-E, Mike TV.

1401
00:56:59,280 --> 00:57:01,600
That's a weird choice by Roald Dahl

1402
00:57:01,600 --> 00:57:03,920
because none of the other kids are named that way.

1403
00:57:03,920 --> 00:57:06,560
Yeah, my name's Augustus Fat Candy.

1404
00:57:06,560 --> 00:57:08,480
Yeah, like it's just such a weird,

1405
00:57:08,480 --> 00:57:11,440
like and Mike TV, I'll come up with something better later.

1406
00:57:11,440 --> 00:57:13,360
Yeah, I'll figure it out later, whatever.

1407
00:57:13,360 --> 00:57:15,760
It might be T-E-A-V-E-E.

1408
00:57:15,760 --> 00:57:19,840
I like to think that if I was a pornographic film actor,

1409
00:57:19,840 --> 00:57:21,760
I would be called Augustus Fat Candy.

1410
00:57:22,720 --> 00:57:25,040
Excuse me, excuse me, just one moment.

1411
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:27,280
Just a moment of your time.

1412
00:57:27,920 --> 00:57:30,000
I Googled to check my spelling of Mike TV

1413
00:57:30,640 --> 00:57:32,240
and on the Wikipedia page,

1414
00:57:32,240 --> 00:57:36,160
or sorry, the Roald Dahl Wiki page for Mike TV,

1415
00:57:36,160 --> 00:57:37,600
there's a behind the scenes fact

1416
00:57:38,160 --> 00:57:40,800
that the original name for Mike TV

1417
00:57:40,800 --> 00:57:43,440
was going to be Herpes Trout.

1418
00:57:44,640 --> 00:57:47,920
Get the fuck out of the door.

1419
00:57:48,880 --> 00:57:51,200
Hey Roald, Roald.

1420
00:57:51,200 --> 00:57:52,800
Yeah, I read through your manuscript here.

1421
00:57:52,800 --> 00:57:54,640
We were so excited to publish your new book.

1422
00:57:55,360 --> 00:57:56,640
Couple notes, couple notes.

1423
00:57:57,280 --> 00:57:59,840
We felt like the pacing was a little off the first 20 minutes.

1424
00:57:59,840 --> 00:58:03,280
Also, one of the kids is named Herpes.

1425
00:58:03,280 --> 00:58:06,160
One of the children is a sexually diseased fish

1426
00:58:06,160 --> 00:58:07,520
and maybe we could roll that back a little.

1427
00:58:07,520 --> 00:58:10,720
We could roll that back a little bit, what do you say?

1428
00:58:10,720 --> 00:58:13,440
And also maybe instead of being a kid

1429
00:58:13,440 --> 00:58:15,680
who's obsessed with sexually diseased fish,

1430
00:58:15,680 --> 00:58:16,960
he just watches a lot of TV.

1431
00:58:16,960 --> 00:58:18,160
Watch a lot of television

1432
00:58:18,160 --> 00:58:20,240
and there could be a bit of a morality tale there.

1433
00:58:21,440 --> 00:58:22,400
I know what I need.

1434
00:58:24,800 --> 00:58:27,200
All men sound like this to Griffin.

1435
00:58:28,320 --> 00:58:30,960
I'm gonna have to rethink the whole book now.

1436
00:58:30,960 --> 00:58:33,120
My life is basically like Anomalisa

1437
00:58:33,120 --> 00:58:36,320
where every man who isn't one of you two basically

1438
00:58:36,320 --> 00:58:39,200
just, hey Griffin, you wanna come watch

1439
00:58:39,200 --> 00:58:40,480
the Royal Rumble today?

1440
00:58:40,480 --> 00:58:41,040
Yeah, sure.

1441
00:58:41,600 --> 00:58:43,920
So anyway, this has been my brother, my brother and me.

1442
00:58:44,560 --> 00:58:47,120
It's an advice show for the modern era.

1443
00:58:47,120 --> 00:58:48,320
We hope you've enjoyed yourself.

1444
00:58:48,320 --> 00:58:51,680
We have some exciting announcements for a change.

1445
00:58:52,960 --> 00:58:54,160
We're doing things again.

1446
00:58:54,160 --> 00:58:55,360
We're doing things again.

1447
00:58:55,360 --> 00:58:57,040
We're shaking off our torpor.

1448
00:58:57,760 --> 00:59:00,240
Against all odds, we're doing things again.

1449
00:59:01,360 --> 00:59:04,000
So first off, and we don't have specifics on this,

1450
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:09,600
but the trailer for our show is going to drop this week

1451
00:59:09,600 --> 00:59:13,600
at some point, maybe today, maybe tomorrow.

1452
00:59:13,600 --> 00:59:17,040
This is like a super cut trailer with clips.

1453
00:59:17,680 --> 00:59:18,560
Have y'all seen it?

1454
00:59:18,560 --> 00:59:20,080
Because we saw the original trailer,

1455
00:59:20,080 --> 00:59:22,000
but there was far too much cursing in it.

1456
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:25,040
Yeah, we actually had an original cut that we loved

1457
00:59:25,040 --> 00:59:29,760
that had like seven f-words in it.

1458
00:59:29,760 --> 00:59:31,520
And then we cut those out.

1459
00:59:31,520 --> 00:59:32,800
It's still very good.

1460
00:59:32,800 --> 00:59:34,480
And like you're not missing anything

1461
00:59:34,480 --> 00:59:36,720
because we just say that word when we can't think

1462
00:59:36,720 --> 00:59:38,480
of a funny thing to say.

1463
00:59:38,480 --> 00:59:39,840
So you're not missing much.

1464
00:59:39,840 --> 00:59:44,080
But that trailer will go up somewhere this week.

1465
00:59:44,080 --> 00:59:49,520
So keep an eye on at NBNBAM or our Facebook page

1466
00:59:49,520 --> 00:59:51,440
and we'll be sure to retweet it from there.

1467
00:59:52,560 --> 01:00:00,800
Also, we are doing a live show in Portland, Oregon on March 18th.

1468
01:00:00,800 --> 01:00:04,480
And that's going to be part of the XOXO Fest,

1469
01:00:05,200 --> 01:00:07,040
which we're excited to be a part of.

1470
01:00:08,560 --> 01:00:10,720
And yeah, it's our first live show in...

1471
01:00:10,720 --> 01:00:11,280
Fuck dudes.

1472
01:00:11,280 --> 01:00:12,720
What was the last live show we did?

1473
01:00:12,720 --> 01:00:13,920
Candle Nights in September?

1474
01:00:13,920 --> 01:00:14,480
Yeah.

1475
01:00:14,480 --> 01:00:15,120
Yes, Griffin.

1476
01:00:15,120 --> 01:00:16,400
Then we had Babies.

1477
01:00:16,400 --> 01:00:17,520
Then we all had Babies.

1478
01:00:17,520 --> 01:00:18,160
Yeah, damn it.

1479
01:00:19,040 --> 01:00:24,000
But Trav, you need to gin up a bit.ly link for this.

1480
01:00:25,120 --> 01:00:26,560
Okay, I'll do it right now.

1481
01:00:26,560 --> 01:00:27,040
Okay.

1482
01:00:27,040 --> 01:00:29,200
How about MBMBAM XOXO?

1483
01:00:29,200 --> 01:00:29,760
Yeah, that's good.

1484
01:00:29,760 --> 01:00:30,240
Cool.

1485
01:00:30,240 --> 01:00:35,360
MBMBAM bit.ly forward slash MBMBAM XOXO.

1486
01:00:36,400 --> 01:00:39,040
We need to address is the XOXO Fest...

1487
01:00:39,040 --> 01:00:39,840
Is that Zozo?

1488
01:00:40,640 --> 01:00:42,080
Is he haunting us again?

1489
01:00:42,080 --> 01:00:43,040
Is that Zozo?

1490
01:00:43,920 --> 01:00:44,560
Back in the mix.

1491
01:00:44,560 --> 01:00:44,960
Damn it.

1492
01:00:44,960 --> 01:00:46,640
But that's going to be March 18th.

1493
01:00:47,280 --> 01:00:48,960
Doors at six, show at seven.

1494
01:00:48,960 --> 01:00:52,720
My brother, my brother and me, the podcast.

1495
01:00:52,720 --> 01:00:54,960
So that'll be popping off.

1496
01:00:54,960 --> 01:00:58,480
We're also in the process of planning another live show

1497
01:00:58,480 --> 01:01:01,760
for later in the spring and details to follow.

1498
01:01:01,760 --> 01:01:04,240
Details to follow, but soon, should follow soon.

1499
01:01:04,240 --> 01:01:07,280
As soon as we have dates, because we know it's an issue

1500
01:01:07,280 --> 01:01:10,400
for people to clear up schedule times and things like that.

1501
01:01:10,400 --> 01:01:12,880
It's going to be a single city jam.

1502
01:01:12,880 --> 01:01:17,680
Like our Boston show, but it's going to be fun.

1503
01:01:19,200 --> 01:01:19,680
Fun and good.

1504
01:01:19,680 --> 01:01:20,320
We'll let you know.

1505
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:23,680
Thank you to John Roderick and the Long Winters

1506
01:01:23,680 --> 01:01:24,560
for the use of our theme song

1507
01:01:24,560 --> 01:01:26,480
and to departure off the album, Putting the Days to Bed.

1508
01:01:26,480 --> 01:01:29,280
It's a wonderful album that you need to have.

1509
01:01:29,280 --> 01:01:30,240
Have it somehow.

1510
01:01:31,360 --> 01:01:32,720

We're done?

1528

Yeah, I think so.

1529
01:02:09,760 --> 01:02:10,480
Yeah, I think so.

1530
01:02:10,480 --> 01:02:10,640
Yeah.

1531
01:02:10,640 --> 01:02:11,600
Yeah, cool.

1532
01:02:11,600 --> 01:02:13,680
Got a final Yahoo here from Morgan Davey.

1533
01:02:13,680 --> 01:02:14,880
Keep it wavy, Morgan Davey.

1534
01:02:14,880 --> 01:02:15,520
Thank you, Morgan.

1535
01:02:15,520 --> 01:02:20,720
It's by Yahoo Answers user Gabriel the Angel.

1536
01:02:21,280 --> 01:02:24,400
Gabriel the Angel, who asks,

1537
01:02:24,400 --> 01:02:29,520
where can I get free clarinet sheet music of Linkin Park?

1538
01:02:36,320 --> 01:02:37,920
My name is Justin McElroy.

1539
01:02:37,920 --> 01:02:42,160
I'm Travis McElroy.

1540
01:02:42,160 --> 01:02:43,680
This has been My Brother, My Brother,

1541
01:02:43,680 --> 01:03:02,000
Rink Eastern Dance Corps on the Lips.

1542
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:03,360
My name is Patrick.

1543
01:03:03,360 --> 01:03:04,720
My name is Ariel.

1544
01:03:04,720 --> 01:03:06,080
My name is Joe Coghlin.

1545
01:03:06,080 --> 01:03:08,640
The first time I went to Max Fun Con,

1546
01:03:08,640 --> 01:03:10,480
I didn't know anyone.

1547
01:03:10,480 --> 01:03:12,560
I wasn't really nervous about that.

1548
01:03:12,560 --> 01:03:15,440
Everyone said not to worry about going alone,

1549
01:03:15,440 --> 01:03:16,880
that I'd make friends right away,

1550
01:03:16,880 --> 01:03:18,560
that I'd have an amazing time.

1551
01:03:18,560 --> 01:03:20,320
It turns out everyone was right.

1552
01:03:20,880 --> 01:03:23,280
I instantly had 200 new friends.

1553
01:03:23,280 --> 01:03:26,480
I've made lifelong friends at Max Fun Con

1554
01:03:26,480 --> 01:03:29,600
that I'm going to keep in touch with for the rest of my life.

1555
01:03:30,160 --> 01:03:33,600
If you aren't sure if you belong at Max Fun Con, you belong.

1556
01:03:34,160 --> 01:03:35,520
Don't be like me.

1557
01:03:35,520 --> 01:03:37,920
Don't waste two years being too nervous.

1558
01:03:37,920 --> 01:03:39,120
Just go already.

1559
01:03:39,120 --> 01:03:43,200
Join Ariel, Patrick, and Joe at Max Fun Con.
