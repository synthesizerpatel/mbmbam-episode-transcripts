1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:30,640
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:47,360
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to My Brother, My Brother, and Me, your home

6
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:54,560
for the best in fantasy football recommendations, strategy, and buds.

7
00:00:54,560 --> 00:01:03,920
Now, Justin, correct me if I'm wrong, because I know very little about fantasy football,

8
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:08,960
but would you say that the best choice for a quarterback would be a football unicorn?

9
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:15,920
What the fuck are you- can we not go- What does that even mean, Travis?

10
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:20,160
Like a unicorn that's been like genetically engineered to be good at football.

11
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:25,520
What? Okay, that- there are so many problems. I don't even understand-

12
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:29,360
Well, because it's fantasy football. That's the good thing, because it's fantasy.

13
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:30,320
Ah, fuck.

14
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:37,760
Oh, okay. There's fantasy creatures. You're saying, could you have Bahama as your tight end?

15
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:38,000
Yeah.

16
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,520
As your, for example.

17
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:41,680
Yeah, that probably would have made a better opening, goof.

18
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:47,920
Would it be difficult to balance the sport should Ragnarok be your kicker?

19
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:56,560
That's possible, yes. I think that balance is always going to be your big problem with any

20
00:01:56,560 --> 00:02:02,240
fantasy league. How do you separate the men from the boys, from the dragons, from the chimera?

21
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:07,920
But really, I mean, that is sort of the core tenet of the draft, isn't it? I mean,

22
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:12,240
that's why the draft exists. It's so you can't- even, you know, big spenders,

23
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:18,800
uh, like the, like the, you know, the Middle Earth Miradons, they can't, they can't just buy up

24
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:23,600
all the good players, you know? You gotta take turns to pick them like you do in a draft.

25
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:28,800
Right. Somebody's trying to outflank you by picking, let's say, a griffin.

26
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:29,360
Yeah.

27
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:32,240
You maybe have to sneak in there and get Maurice Jones Drew.

28
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:37,120
Yeah, that's the tricky- that is the tricky part. Maurice Jones Drew, by the way, is a ghost. We

29
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:37,760
all know that.

30
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:38,240
Uh-huh.

31
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:44,000
Yeah. Which is why he's- he can play in both leagues. He's the day walker of football.

32
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,720
He is the day walker. He is half ghost and half person.

33
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:52,080
Do you- are you- now, guys, tell me about your fantasy football teams this year. I actually

34
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:58,160
have one in the sweet release fantasy football league. My team is called Touchdown and Abbey.

35
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:00,480
Oh, that's good.

36
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:01,760
That's good. Mine is, uh-

37
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:02,240
It's pretty good.

38
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:08,080
Mine is- can you somehow share the logo? Because it's the greatest thing I've ever seen.

39
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:08,480
It's-

40
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:11,200
I don't know. I'll try to remember to put it in the forum.

41
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:15,760
It's Maggie Smith being- it is the Dowager Countess being doused with

42
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:20,160
Gatorade, like you do- you know how sometimes when you win a football game,

43
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:24,640
they douse you with Gatorade just to say, like, good work. Have this refreshment.

44
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:25,760
It's basically that.

45
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:26,960
Please enjoy this refreshment.

46
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:30,160
With- but with Maggie Smith. My team is called the Mario Lopez Dispenser.

47
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:34,960
Do you think- do you think that, uh- that's a very good team name.

48
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:34,960
Thanks.

49
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:39,440
Do you think that there's ever one guy who just finished a big ball game,

50
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:43,440
and maybe he has been running a lot, and he's going to go get some Gatorade,

51
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:47,760
and just as he's about to get some, he's like, wait, no, wait, no, no, wait, ah.

52
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:52,080
Justin, I'm not gonna- I'm not gonna lie to you. That happens once a game, I feel like.

53
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:56,240
I feel like every game there's that one guy who's like, oh, oh, shit, what time is it?

54
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:59,840
How much time is left on the clock? Do I have enough time to get in a- ah, man.

55
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:02,000
And then you gotta wring out the coach's jacket.

56
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,120
Yeah, and then you have to go over to the other team who lost, and be like,

57
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:08,480
hey, I don't mean to rub it in. Real thirsty.

58
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:10,960
Can I get some- Can I have some of that gate-gate?

59
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:13,360
Oh, you got Powerade? Oh, never mind.

60
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:18,400
Man, I'm switching teams. You guys got- you guys got high-ser- you got Ectocores?

61
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:19,040
Oh, shit.

62
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:21,280
Oh, fuck! You guys just hand out Capri Suns?

63
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:24,000
You got the Lemon Twinkies? I'm switching teams.

64
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:28,080
And as you know, I do not- I do not have a fancy football team name,

65
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:31,280
uh, because I tested positive in the random drug testing.

66
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:36,720
Yep. Now, I have to ask, Travis- I have to ask why you thought juicing-

67
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:41,040
Here's where I'm confused. You're not actually the one playing the sport.

68
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:44,320
There's- it's very low contact activity drafting.

69
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:46,160
Well, I'll tell you what you are playing, Griffin.

70
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:46,880
Mine games.

71
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:47,120
Okay.

72
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:48,400
Okay.

73
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:48,960
I'm not sure-

74
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:50,160
I wanted to take brain steroids.

75
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:54,160
Okay. This- this podcast is basically brain steroids,

76
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:55,840
because it makes it so much smarter when you hear it.

77
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:58,720
I tested positive for my brother, my brother, and me.

78
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:03,040
I'm so ashamed. I've been stripped of all my titles.

79
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:03,280
Are you-

80
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:05,600
He's on the bro. Did you hear? He's on the bro.

81
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:07,840
This guy's bamin' over here. Call the commish.

82
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:10,880
Call the commish. This guy's bamin'. He's too good at life.

83
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:15,440
The life commish will- will shut you down if you're bamin'.

84
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:19,120
And they- and they discover it. So keep it secret, keep it safe, but do tell a friend.

85
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:22,640
Uh, on this show, we take advice, and we give it to you.

86
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:23,280
Okay.

87
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:26,400
We take advice, we bury it in the ground for three years.

88
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:31,040
And it sprouts. It- we let the interest accrue on the advice in the smart bank.

89
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:34,720
We put it in our brain wombs for nine months, and then it gestates,

90
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:37,440
and then it comes out of our mouths? Ew!

91
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:38,720
Ew, gross.

92
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:42,560
And then it consumes us, and thus continuing the cycle.

93
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:46,160
Here's our first question. Brothers, I desperately need your help.

94
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:50,240
For the past eight years, I have been heavily addicted to Diet Mountain Dew.

95
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:51,920
I drink three liters a day.

96
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:52,240
Whoa!

97
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:55,280
Obviously, this is not a good thing.

98
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:58,800
I've tried to quit in the past, using other types of caffeine intake as a replacement,

99
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:01,680
but I keep coming back to that sweet, sweet Dew.

100
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:05,040
I can't drink coffee, and other similar drinks taste gross to me.

101
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:09,440
Any suggestions before my bones melt? That's from OverDewInTheDew.

102
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:12,000
Here's the problem.

103
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:14,400
And you know what the problem is.

104
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:19,040
You are saying, this thing's killing me slowly, but goddammit, I love it.

105
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:21,440
Like, I think you may be- I think you may be-

106
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:25,120
Can I just say, if- if you love it so much, just drink it.

107
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:27,600
Do you really want to live a life without the Dew?

108
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:30,560
Listen, if it were bad for you, they wouldn't sell it, you guys.

109
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:32,400
Okay, Scott, such a good point, Trav.

110
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:34,240
I know. There's regulations for that kind of thing.

111
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:38,480
We have a little thing called the FDA, and if things are dangerous for you, they can't sell them.

112
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:40,320
The Federal Dew Association.

113
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:44,480
Yeah, which is- they're the ones that fucking took down my live wire.

114
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:46,640
Thanks- thanks, FDA. You're the fucking worst.

115
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:47,600
Thanks, FDA.

116
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:49,600
How am I supposed to get gized and play Halo?

117
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:54,320
They're also the ones that shut down JASTA.

118
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:56,480
Yeah, well, that one was totally-

119
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:58,080
That was a good call. That was too much-

120
00:06:58,080 --> 00:06:59,520
That was for the good of mankind.

121
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:00,720
There's too much guarna-

122
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:01,280
Guarana.

123
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:06,720
I vibrated so hard that I actually went through the mantle of the earth while drinking JASTA.

124
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:11,440
I actually don't- I- whenever I make references to old energy drinks,

125
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:13,520
I never know, like, what the threshold is for people.

126
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:13,920
Yeah.

127
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:16,640
Like, if I say JASTA, are people gonna be down with that?

128
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:19,440
If I talk about Surge, are people gonna be down with that?

129
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:20,800
Man, Surge was so good.

130
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:21,120
Surge was so great.

131
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:24,800
But the question is, like, now, if you compare that to, like, a Red Bull or, like,

132
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:27,520
a Monster Energy drink, would it be, like, drinking water?

133
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:31,040
It's like grandpa tea. It's like nothing. It's nothing.

134
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:34,880
I drank a Red Bull the other day, and three of my teeth melted.

135
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:37,280
In my mouth. Just melted right there in it.

136
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:39,600
Never happened when I drank Surge. I only lost one tooth.

137
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:45,360
I think it- I mean, it's much like any addiction, right?

138
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:48,080
Stop buying it.

139
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:53,520
If you don't want to- no one has ever thrust a Diet Mountain Dew in my hand and be like,

140
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:55,920
hey, bro, swish it down.

141
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:57,520
And I've been like, yes.

142
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:58,960
All right, you guys.

143
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:02,640
Can I get a no urine guarantee? Nope.

144
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:06,560
Okay. I'm not drinking this thing. Just don't buy it.

145
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:09,360
And my advice to you is just to quit cold turkey,

146
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:14,160
because if you allow yourself, you know, the occasional treat, you'll never stop.

147
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:16,880
Like, because it'll just get you in the end, you know?

148
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:21,520
I've known so many people, friends of ours, that have like smoked since they were like 15,

149
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:24,720
and then they quit for like 10 years.

150
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:28,480
And then one night out at a party, they're like, well, I haven't had a cigarette in 10 years.

151
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:28,960
I've earned it.

152
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:32,240
They have one, and pretty soon they're like two pack a day smoker again.

153
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:35,040
So Mountain Dew is pretty much the same thing.

154
00:08:35,040 --> 00:08:39,680
But it's easier to quit Mountain Dew because, I mean, if you're a smoker,

155
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:41,840
you probably associate with other people who are smoking.

156
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:48,080
It's easiest thing in the world to say, hey, Dylan, you know, peel me off one of those coffin nails

157
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:50,320
and let me get down the flavor highway.

158
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:56,000
It's another thing to be like, oh, man, that Dew looks refreshing.

159
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,320
I'm going to drink fucking three of those today.

160
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:03,280
Why don't you just pass me that Dew, and I don't know what you'll do about it,

161
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:06,320
but I would just like to drink your Dew, please.

162
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:08,560
You can't bum a Dew. You've got to buy one.

163
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:10,800
Can I just get like a bottle cap of Dew?

164
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:12,000
I just want the flavor.

165
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,120
I just need to taste it.

166
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:16,320
If you're going out to a bar and you know you're going to party all night,

167
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:19,280
you don't go out and buy a pack of Mountain Dew in advance

168
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:21,120
so that you can enjoy it all night long.

169
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:21,600
You know what I mean?

170
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:21,840
Right.

171
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:23,280
Let me hit you with this.

172
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:26,480
Maybe you replace your diet Mountain Dew with Mountain Dew.

173
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:28,560
Would that help?

174
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:29,440
Would that help you, Ronald?

175
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:30,880
And you drink more of it.

176
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:32,480
You know what?

177
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:33,920
I say go for the record.

178
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:36,400
I don't know what the record is on drinking Mountain Dew in one day,

179
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:39,280
but I feel like you've been training for it for eight years,

180
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:41,440
and it's time to just go for it.

181
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:42,720
That's it.

182
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:44,400
Fucking make your kid smoke.

183
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:45,360
Like go for it.

184
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:46,400
Smoke the whole pack.

185
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:47,440
Drink all the Mountain Dew.

186
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:48,800
Bring yourself out in one day,

187
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:51,760
or maybe go into a diabetic coma, but-

188
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:52,800
No, it's diet Mountain Dew.

189
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:53,680
He's going to be fine.

190
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:56,000
Either way, you're going to stop drinking Mountain Dew

191
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,840
because you'll either be sick of it or dead.

192
00:09:58,640 --> 00:09:59,360
Or dead.

193
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:04,000
You'll just be vibrating with whatever chemicals they put into it to get that flavor.

194
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:04,960
You know what?

195
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:06,080
I have a great suggestion.

196
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:11,360
There's a flavored vodka called Mountain Dewed D-O-O-D

197
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:15,440
that you can get that is meant to taste like Mountain Dew.

198
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:16,240
So maybe try that.

199
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:17,520
Why are you giving out?

200
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:18,000
Why are you-

201
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,360
Maybe switch that in.

202
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:21,600
And then drink like three liters of that a day.

203
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:22,960
Drink like three liters of Mountain Dew flavored vodka a day.

204
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:25,200
Maybe toss in some Boone's Farm into the mix.

205
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:27,440
Maybe you're really going to love the way that treats you.

206
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:30,240
Three liters of that a day, and you'll be right as rain.

207
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:31,200
Acid rain.

208
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:31,840
You're going to die.

209
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:33,760
You could do what our friend Jason did

210
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:35,840
and just wrestle a two liter of Mountain Dew to the ground

211
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:38,320
and chug it and then throw up all over the place.

212
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:38,640
Yeah.

213
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:39,360
That happened once.

214
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:43,840
I mean, is it that bad?

215
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:46,000
I drink a lot of coffee every day.

216
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:46,960
Yeah, it's super bad.

217
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:49,200
Just three liters of anything a day is bad.

218
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:49,600
Water?

219
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:50,400
Yeah.

220
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:52,240
You'll get water poisoning.

221
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:54,960
I don't think you guys know how much liters are.

222
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:55,920
Here's what's crazy.

223
00:10:57,120 --> 00:11:01,200
Three liters is one and a half, two liter bottles of something in a day.

224
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:02,960
You're going to lose-

225
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:07,120
That is from waking up in the morning to going to bed at night, all you're doing is drinking Mountain Dew.

226
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:07,440
Yeah.

227
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:09,440
A hundred ounces of water.

228
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:14,480
That is only a few ounces over the daily recommended amount of water.

229
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:14,640
Yeah.

230
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:17,440
Why do you think they recommend less than that?

231
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:18,640
For God's sake.

232
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:18,960
Yeah.

233
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:20,880
I don't think there's a limit.

234
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:23,520
Like if you drink over this much water, you're going to be poisoned.

235
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:24,960
There is in the wasteland.

236
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:25,920
You guys are crazy.

237
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:27,920
I just don't think it's that bad.

238
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:30,080
Just, I mean, maybe cut back?

239
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:32,400
Here's the problem.

240
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:36,480
You got to roll it back slow because you're going to lose a lot of bladder mass when you,

241
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:42,240
if you go from three liters of Mountain Dew a day to zero liters of Mountain Dew a day,

242
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:47,760
your bladder is going to look like a floppy, it's going to look like an elephant's ear in there.

243
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:50,000
And you don't want, like you need to upkeep that.

244
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:55,920
I think you roll it back to maybe 2.5 and then 2.25 and then you slowly back, do you see what I mean?

245
00:11:56,880 --> 00:12:00,320
And don't be concerned when your pee is no longer electric green.

246
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:01,440
That's normal.

247
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:02,720
It's not going to be as fun.

248
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:08,000
But I want to just dip in here real quick and say that according to Mayo Clinic,

249
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:12,320
an adequate intake of water for men is three liters a day.

250
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:16,720
So Justin, there's no place here for your science.

251
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:18,000
So that is the thing.

252
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:23,920
I say swap out one liter for water and just see how it treats you.

253
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:26,800
If you can get up to where you're, nobody's drinking enough water.

254
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:27,360
That's fact.

255
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:28,000
That's a fact.

256
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,360
I don't, nobody does.

257
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:34,080
If you drank all that Mountain Dew, but with water, oh man, you're going to feel good.

258
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:35,840
You're going to have the advantage over everybody.

259
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:39,040
Can I, can I talk about real quick right now?

260
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:43,040
I'm drinking tea and I'm not a tea drinker.

261
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:46,800
I'm drinking Wildberry Zinger from Celestial Seasonings.

262
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:51,680
Mostly because all of the, like the past six words that I said just then

263
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:53,600
were like among my favorite words ever.

264
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:58,400
Um, but I'm drinking it right now because I'm so hung over and

265
00:12:58,400 --> 00:13:01,760
literally no other substance sounds good to put in my body.

266
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:03,140
Hmm.

267
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:04,260
Interesting.

268
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:07,120
That's a very personal story, Griffin.

269
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:08,160
Thank you for sharing.

270
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:11,600
I'm just saying personal and unentertaining.

271
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:14,720
Listen, no, listen, you don't understand what I'm saying to this gentleman.

272
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:16,880
Clearly.

273
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:18,000
He should get super drunk.

274
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:21,440
You get super drunk and you'll never want to drink anything ever again,

275
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:23,680
except shitty Celestial Seasonings tea.

276
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:25,120
You know what I like?

277
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:26,960
I'm into that chai tea.

278
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:28,000
Oh yeah.

279
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,120
That's what I like.

280
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:32,480
This question is boring and the answers are even more boring.

281
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:35,200
Just stop drinking Mountain Dew.

282
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:36,720
Just stop it.

283
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:37,360
Look at me.

284
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:38,320
Look in my eyes.

285
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:39,600
Look in your podcast eyes.

286
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:41,440
Do you want us, we can, we can shame you.

287
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:43,200
Just stop it.

288
00:13:44,640 --> 00:13:46,240
You want to have a real addiction?

289
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:50,000
Ray Charles quit heroin and smoking simultaneously.

290
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,520
Hand smoking simultaneously.

291
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:54,240
That's, that's an addiction.

292
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:55,280
You don't have an addiction.

293
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:56,880
You have habits.

294
00:13:57,680 --> 00:13:58,960
Stop drinking it.

295
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:01,600
Start doing heroin.

296
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:03,760
Start doing heroin.

297
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:05,360
Listen to Ray Charles.

298
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:06,880
You should be doing that anyways.

299
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:09,920
Get that Dew off your back and get a monkey on your back.

300
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:12,880
Get yourself a proper addiction like a grown up.

301
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:16,480
And then get a monkey and train him to slap the Mountain Dew out of your hand.

302
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:17,200
Oh my God.

303
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:18,960
That's a, see, that's a good suggestion.

304
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:20,320
Reverend, can you give me a Yahoo?

305
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:20,880
I can do that.

306
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:22,560
I'm disgusted.

307
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:23,040
Yeah, sure, sure.

308
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:23,520
For myself.

309
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:27,200
This Yahoo answer was sent in by Jacob Locker.

310
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:27,920
Thank you, Jacob.

311
00:14:28,640 --> 00:14:30,960
That's by Yahoo answers user, the Christ puncher.

312
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:31,460
Jacob.

313
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:32,960
Jacob.

314
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:35,760
The Christ puncher who asks.

315
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:37,920
We've had questions from the Christ puncher before.

316
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:38,720
Probably.

317
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:41,040
How can I make horse not bite the cow?

318
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:46,400
Three days ago.

319
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:47,440
Horse named Derek.

320
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:48,240
Bited the cow.

321
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:48,960
My dad have.

322
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:54,880
Three days ago.

323
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:55,760
Horse named Derek.

324
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:56,400
Bited the cow.

325
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:57,120
My dad have.

326
00:14:57,680 --> 00:15:00,800
Then the cow not tell nobody have big problems.

327
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:01,520
Infection.

328
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:03,520
The cow died.

329
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:08,960
Bad horse make to the cow died when he are bided him.

330
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:10,080
Infection.

331
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:11,760
How make horse stop bided things?

332
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:17,520
You know, there's, it's, it's such a common problem.

333
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:20,000
Listen cows, tell somebody.

334
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:20,640
Yeah.

335
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:22,960
When this happens, you're the victim.

336
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:24,320
See something, say something.

337
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:25,360
Yeah.

338
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:26,800
No one's going to turn you into ground beef.

339
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:27,840
They're going to believe you.

340
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:28,880
You got bided.

341
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:31,600
Well, nobody wants to eat ground beef if it has big problems.

342
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:32,640
Vis a vis infection.

343
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:36,160
FYI, when someone says they got bided,

344
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:38,800
I assume that they got played a prank on by Joe Biden.

345
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:41,840
I don't think that that is a colloquialism.

346
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:43,200
Have you seen the latest season?

347
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:43,920
You got bided.

348
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:45,360
Have you seen the latest season of Bited?

349
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:45,840
He's back.

350
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:47,040
He's back.

351
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:48,000
He's better than ever.

352
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:51,680
I saw him pull a, pull a fast one on Nick Cannon.

353
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:54,480
And Nick Cannon was like, what?

354
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:55,840
He was like, bided.

355
00:15:55,840 --> 00:15:57,440
And just before he does the prank, he says,

356
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:58,720
I'm just biding my time.

357
00:15:58,720 --> 00:15:58,880
Yeah.

358
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:00,000
He did say that.

359
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:03,120
Mostly the show's pretty heavy on Biden puns.

360
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:05,360
He says biding my time and not Biden.

361
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:06,720
So it's like almost a pun.

362
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:07,760
It's weird.

363
00:16:07,760 --> 00:16:09,040
And he's like chewing a clock.

364
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:10,880
It's like the fucking strangest thing.

365
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:11,120
Yeah.

366
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:12,320
It's a really good show.

367
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:13,680
Yeah.

368
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:14,080
It's good.

369
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:15,040
Yeah.

370
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:16,080
It's a pretty good show.

371
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:19,280
It's produced by the same guy that said who's your daddy?

372
00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:21,360
Where the girls try to figure out who their fathers are.

373
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:23,120
So it's got a good pedigree.

374
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:27,840
Oh, so-

375
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:29,840
Don't let your horse near your cow.

376
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:30,160
Yeah.

377
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:30,480
Here's a-

378
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:32,640
Yeah, if you can just run away, keep them separated.

379
00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:33,140
Yeah.

380
00:16:33,140 --> 00:16:34,340
Yeah.

381
00:16:34,340 --> 00:16:36,180
Why do you have them in the same house?

382
00:16:36,180 --> 00:16:37,620
Cows live in houses.

383
00:16:37,620 --> 00:16:38,020
Oh, yeah.

384
00:16:38,020 --> 00:16:38,660
Cow houses.

385
00:16:38,660 --> 00:16:39,140
Cowses.

386
00:16:40,660 --> 00:16:41,540
Travis.

387
00:16:41,540 --> 00:16:42,100
What?

388
00:16:42,100 --> 00:16:42,580
Go away.

389
00:16:42,580 --> 00:16:45,140
We can't reduce ourselves with portmanteau.

390
00:16:45,700 --> 00:16:50,980
Once we've retreated to the bastion of comedy via neologism,

391
00:16:50,980 --> 00:16:53,060
then I think we're pretty much sunk.

392
00:16:53,060 --> 00:16:53,300
Okay.

393
00:16:54,500 --> 00:16:55,460
I am chastised.

394
00:16:56,580 --> 00:16:58,340
Well, you're travtised because-

395
00:16:58,340 --> 00:16:58,820
Ah!

396
00:16:58,820 --> 00:17:03,380
Travis, can we put a ball and gag in this horse?

397
00:17:05,940 --> 00:17:09,700
A man in the iron mask style horse mask.

398
00:17:09,700 --> 00:17:11,380
Do you guys have a question?

399
00:17:11,380 --> 00:17:12,100
Yeah.

400
00:17:12,100 --> 00:17:14,100
Do you feel like this hasn't been very funny so far?

401
00:17:14,820 --> 00:17:16,340
What, this question or this episode?

402
00:17:16,340 --> 00:17:17,380
That episode.

403
00:17:17,380 --> 00:17:18,660
Yeah, I feel like we're nailing it.

404
00:17:20,820 --> 00:17:22,660
Griffin, what do you think has been the funniest part?

405
00:17:22,660 --> 00:17:29,940
We talked about fantasy football and we all sort of brought out all of the Final Fantasy

406
00:17:29,940 --> 00:17:30,740
summons that we knew.

407
00:17:31,460 --> 00:17:33,540
That was probably the highlight for me.

408
00:17:34,100 --> 00:17:34,980
That was pretty good.

409
00:17:34,980 --> 00:17:36,740
Justin, what's your favorite part so far?

410
00:17:36,740 --> 00:17:40,260
What I wanted to do was remind people that there were some good things in there,

411
00:17:40,260 --> 00:17:44,660
because I feel like they might be trying to get way down with how we have said too many

412
00:17:44,660 --> 00:17:44,740
funny things.

413
00:17:44,740 --> 00:17:50,020
No, and you know, there probably are those people that, you know, they hold up the stopwatch

414
00:17:50,020 --> 00:17:53,060
and they time it out every time they reset it, you know?

415
00:17:53,060 --> 00:17:54,580
Just to see if it would break that 10 minute.

416
00:17:54,580 --> 00:17:55,780
How many giggles per minute?

417
00:17:55,780 --> 00:17:58,980
Yeah, if it hits that 10 minute mark, maybe you go turn it off.

418
00:17:58,980 --> 00:18:00,260
Maybe you go listen to the new WTF.

419
00:18:01,300 --> 00:18:03,540
I'm sure that that's a thing that people are doing.

420
00:18:03,540 --> 00:18:04,260
And you know what?

421
00:18:04,260 --> 00:18:04,740
That's fine.

422
00:18:04,740 --> 00:18:05,460
I like the challenge.

423
00:18:06,180 --> 00:18:10,340
But I think there's probably an even larger number of people that simply haven't turned

424
00:18:10,340 --> 00:18:13,460
it off because both of their hands have the vacuum in it.

425
00:18:13,460 --> 00:18:16,340
So they figure, well, I'm sure it's going to turn it off.

426
00:18:16,340 --> 00:18:22,020
Now let me just ask real quick, what kind of vacuum, what kind of broadsword vacuum

427
00:18:22,020 --> 00:18:25,460
are these people using that they need two hands to wield its mighty power?

428
00:18:26,820 --> 00:18:27,700
The dust slayer.

429
00:18:28,820 --> 00:18:29,940
They're using the Dyson.

430
00:18:29,940 --> 00:18:30,740
Oh, I see.

431
00:18:33,060 --> 00:18:38,180
One hand to sweep and the other hand to jerk off.

432
00:18:38,180 --> 00:18:39,940
I was going to say jerk off.

433
00:18:39,940 --> 00:18:41,380
I was going to say jerk off too.

434
00:18:41,380 --> 00:18:44,820
So we can all agree that there are people out there listening to our show,

435
00:18:44,820 --> 00:18:47,060
jerking off and then vacuuming up their jizz.

436
00:18:47,060 --> 00:18:47,940
This is a thing that's happening.

437
00:18:47,940 --> 00:18:49,220
They call it vacuuming.

438
00:18:49,220 --> 00:18:49,700
Oh, OK.

439
00:18:49,700 --> 00:18:49,940
Yeah.

440
00:18:49,940 --> 00:18:50,900
They're vacuuming off.

441
00:18:50,900 --> 00:18:51,460
Not vacuuming off.

442
00:18:51,460 --> 00:18:52,500
Thanks, Travis.

443
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:53,700
OK, thanks.

444
00:18:54,580 --> 00:18:55,060
Thanks.

445
00:18:55,060 --> 00:18:55,860
You guys.

446
00:18:55,860 --> 00:18:56,820
How about another question?

447
00:18:56,820 --> 00:18:57,860
How about another Yahoo?

448
00:18:57,860 --> 00:19:00,020
That one wasn't good.

449
00:19:00,020 --> 00:19:00,740
Let's try a different one.

450
00:19:00,740 --> 00:19:02,020
This one I found.

451
00:19:02,020 --> 00:19:07,460
It's by the Christ Puncher who asks, should NFL teams have to reserve a roster spot for

452
00:19:07,460 --> 00:19:07,960
a horse?

453
00:19:09,380 --> 00:19:14,260
I think it is the least the NFL could do to honor the horse in, quite frankly, America.

454
00:19:14,260 --> 00:19:16,340
After all, they sing that song before each game.

455
00:19:16,340 --> 00:19:17,860
Why not have a horse on each team?

456
00:19:17,860 --> 00:19:19,700
Does the NFL hate America or something?

457
00:19:20,980 --> 00:19:21,860
Wow.

458
00:19:21,860 --> 00:19:24,260
Why is Christ Puncher so obsessed with horses?

459
00:19:24,260 --> 00:19:25,220
Why aren't you?

460
00:19:26,020 --> 00:19:26,740
Why are we?

461
00:19:27,460 --> 00:19:28,180
Fair enough.

462
00:19:28,180 --> 00:19:29,060
More accurately.

463
00:19:30,260 --> 00:19:30,820
We love them.

464
00:19:31,620 --> 00:19:35,300
Wasn't there a movie in which like a horse was like the kicker for a team or something?

465
00:19:35,300 --> 00:19:36,180
Am I making that up?

466
00:19:36,180 --> 00:19:37,780
It was a donkey named Gus.

467
00:19:39,540 --> 00:19:40,500
How do you know that?

468
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:46,660
Because I love the work of the fucking, who's that?

469
00:19:46,660 --> 00:19:48,340
Who's that son of a bitch from Andy Griffith?

470
00:19:48,340 --> 00:19:48,980
Don't help him.

471
00:19:51,060 --> 00:19:54,020
Not Don Adams, but the guy whose name is like Don Adams.

472
00:19:54,020 --> 00:19:55,060
Don Cheadle.

473
00:19:55,060 --> 00:19:56,020
Don McClain.

474
00:19:56,020 --> 00:19:57,700
No, he's got like a rubber face.

475
00:19:58,740 --> 00:20:00,660
And he's like Don Draper.

476
00:20:01,220 --> 00:20:02,820
No, Don Draper.

477
00:20:02,820 --> 00:20:04,020
I think it's Don Draper.

478
00:20:04,020 --> 00:20:06,020
No, and it's not Don Adams.

479
00:20:06,020 --> 00:20:06,820
Randy Griffith.

480
00:20:06,820 --> 00:20:07,940
Randy Griffith?

481
00:20:07,940 --> 00:20:08,980
Is it Randy?

482
00:20:08,980 --> 00:20:10,180
Randy Griffith.

483
00:20:10,180 --> 00:20:11,460
He played Barney Fife.

484
00:20:12,100 --> 00:20:12,600
Yes.

485
00:20:13,060 --> 00:20:13,780
Tandy Griffith.

486
00:20:14,820 --> 00:20:16,660
It's not Tandy Griffith.

487
00:20:16,660 --> 00:20:17,860
He played Barney Fife.

488
00:20:17,860 --> 00:20:19,060
Who played Barney Fife?

489
00:20:19,060 --> 00:20:19,780
Barney Griffith.

490
00:20:19,780 --> 00:20:20,100
Randy.

491
00:20:20,100 --> 00:20:20,740
I'm not gonna.

492
00:20:20,740 --> 00:20:21,780
Randy Candy Griffith.

493
00:20:22,340 --> 00:20:22,900
Sidney.

494
00:20:22,900 --> 00:20:23,540
Sidney's here.

495
00:20:23,540 --> 00:20:24,500
Who played Barney Fife?

496
00:20:27,860 --> 00:20:31,620
If I was a real quick aside while Justin's talking, getting a, phoning a friend.

497
00:20:31,620 --> 00:20:35,380
I'm just saying that if I was a male stripper, my name would be Randy Candy Griffith.

498
00:20:35,380 --> 00:20:38,900
Don Knotts, you motherfucking assholes.

499
00:20:38,900 --> 00:20:41,540
Sorry, you just got phased by my memory.

500
00:20:41,540 --> 00:20:42,740
You got bided.

501
00:20:42,740 --> 00:20:45,780
You just got bided because I remembered it's Don Knotts.

502
00:20:46,820 --> 00:20:51,940
We got running backs, we got quarterbacks, halfbacks, fullbacks, wide receivers, tight ends.

503
00:20:51,940 --> 00:20:52,500
Bear backs.

504
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:53,220
Safeties.

505
00:20:54,420 --> 00:20:56,420
Thank you, that, that's the name, there you go.

506
00:20:56,420 --> 00:21:00,180
That's, you got, and then you can probably swap out one of the running backs with a bear back.

507
00:21:00,180 --> 00:21:01,060
Here's the question.

508
00:21:01,060 --> 00:21:04,580
Can the other running back mount the horse and ride it into the end zone?

509
00:21:04,580 --> 00:21:08,180
Because that horse has no other means to, to, to carry the ball, you know?

510
00:21:08,180 --> 00:21:11,860
Yes, but the trick is, it also works in the reverse.

511
00:21:11,860 --> 00:21:13,860
The horse can jump on his back.

512
00:21:13,860 --> 00:21:15,860
My problem with football is there's no strategy.

513
00:21:15,860 --> 00:21:22,180
So I think that this will finally introduce a layer of strategy where, you know, do I get on the horse now?

514
00:21:22,180 --> 00:21:23,220
Is this the right moment?

515
00:21:23,220 --> 00:21:24,340
Is he going to buck me off?

516
00:21:24,340 --> 00:21:25,620
Is this the right horse?

517
00:21:25,620 --> 00:21:27,220
Is this the right horse for me?

518
00:21:28,340 --> 00:21:29,300
Will this horse and I fight?

519
00:21:29,300 --> 00:21:30,340
Do I need to shop around?

520
00:21:30,340 --> 00:21:31,860
Should I check out other horses first?

521
00:21:31,860 --> 00:21:33,220
Is it too early to make a commitment?

522
00:21:33,220 --> 00:21:34,180
Will we have a bond?

523
00:21:34,180 --> 00:21:37,620
Will somebody else on this team, do they have the potential to maybe have a stronger bond?

524
00:21:37,620 --> 00:21:39,620
Do I have a stronger bond with this horse?

525
00:21:39,620 --> 00:21:41,620
Is this even right for me?

526
00:21:41,620 --> 00:21:42,660
Oh, am I horse blocking someone?

527
00:21:42,660 --> 00:21:44,260
Yeah, you gotta be careful.

528
00:21:44,260 --> 00:21:47,860
Is this even right for me to dominate one of God's creatures like this for transportation?

529
00:21:47,860 --> 00:21:48,420
Right.

530
00:21:48,420 --> 00:21:49,380
What will Peeta think?

531
00:21:50,340 --> 00:21:52,020
How many horse powers is this horse?

532
00:21:53,860 --> 00:21:55,220
The answer's always one.

533
00:21:55,220 --> 00:21:55,780
I don't think-

534
00:21:55,780 --> 00:21:56,820
What horse powers does it have?

535
00:21:57,940 --> 00:21:58,980
I don't think that's true.

536
00:21:58,980 --> 00:22:00,580
I don't think every horse is created equal.

537
00:22:00,580 --> 00:22:07,540
I know that that's a major blaspheme to drop on this, which is basically an equestrian podcast at this point.

538
00:22:07,540 --> 00:22:09,940
At this point, it's basically an equestrian podcast.

539
00:22:09,940 --> 00:22:10,180
Yes.

540
00:22:12,020 --> 00:22:14,180
I think some are maybe half a horse power.

541
00:22:14,180 --> 00:22:14,740
Maybe their hearts-

542
00:22:14,740 --> 00:22:18,260
Can you imagine if you were a horse and you were less than one horse power?

543
00:22:18,260 --> 00:22:18,580
Yeah.

544
00:22:18,580 --> 00:22:20,980
That's gotta be like the most embarrassing thing.

545
00:22:20,980 --> 00:22:21,220
Yeah.

546
00:22:22,100 --> 00:22:27,380
Yeah, because it's like, oh, this card is just one horse power to pull, so it shouldn't be a problem.

547
00:22:27,380 --> 00:22:27,860
But you know-

548
00:22:27,860 --> 00:22:28,340
You got this.

549
00:22:28,340 --> 00:22:30,100
You've been inside your seven-eighths horse.

550
00:22:30,100 --> 00:22:30,660
I bet you-

551
00:22:30,660 --> 00:22:32,580
I'm gonna need help.

552
00:22:32,580 --> 00:22:35,700
I bet you Sea Biscuits was like 10 horse power.

553
00:22:36,500 --> 00:22:38,980
He had a heart the size of 10 horse hearts.

554
00:22:38,980 --> 00:22:39,460
Right.

555
00:22:39,460 --> 00:22:41,380
He actually had 10 horse hearts.

556
00:22:41,380 --> 00:22:43,140
That's why it was bulging out in the front.

557
00:22:43,140 --> 00:22:44,980
It was grotesque.

558
00:22:44,980 --> 00:22:46,340
Why is that horse so lumpy?

559
00:22:46,340 --> 00:22:47,700
It was like the final scene in Akira.

560
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:47,700
It was terrible.

561
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:48,980
He was just coming out of his-

562
00:22:48,980 --> 00:22:49,940
It was a nightmare.

563
00:22:49,940 --> 00:22:51,380
Yeah, it was a nightmare.

564
00:22:51,380 --> 00:22:52,020
It was terrible.

565
00:22:52,020 --> 00:22:57,380
It was like a video game boss, just hearts pulsating out of his stomach.

566
00:22:57,380 --> 00:23:00,740
And when he died, all of his hearts exploded at once and turned him inside out.

567
00:23:00,740 --> 00:23:01,060
Yeah.

568
00:23:01,060 --> 00:23:01,860
Oh, God.

569
00:23:02,420 --> 00:23:03,460
It was horrible.

570
00:23:03,460 --> 00:23:04,180
And delicious.

571
00:23:04,180 --> 00:23:10,580
You guys ever seen that movie, The Cell, when the glass stuff drops on it and cuts it into 20 pieces?

572
00:23:11,780 --> 00:23:12,340
Yeah.

573
00:23:12,340 --> 00:23:16,180
I'm just saying that's a real bad way for a horse to go out that happened in a movie.

574
00:23:17,860 --> 00:23:19,940
Yeah, I don't think that's ever really happened before.

575
00:23:19,940 --> 00:23:24,740
The best way for a horse to die is to die peacefully in its bed at the ripe old age of 36,

576
00:23:24,740 --> 00:23:27,460
smoking a pipe surrounded by all those great grand horses.

577
00:23:28,420 --> 00:23:32,500
And he's had the last rites delivered to him by a horse preacher.

578
00:23:33,140 --> 00:23:35,940
What's the option for defensive horses?

579
00:23:35,940 --> 00:23:37,460
Because it doesn't seem like...

580
00:23:37,460 --> 00:23:40,020
It seems like you're going to get a lot of roughing the pasture there.

581
00:23:40,020 --> 00:23:44,180
Because you can't just tell a horse like, hey, he's already passed the ball, don't go after him.

582
00:23:44,180 --> 00:23:44,580
I think that-

583
00:23:44,580 --> 00:23:45,460
No kicking.

584
00:23:45,460 --> 00:23:47,860
I think, or trampling is more what I'm concerned about.

585
00:23:47,860 --> 00:23:49,220
That's more of a horse's forte.

586
00:23:50,500 --> 00:23:54,340
Man, God help you if you drink the Gatorade before the horse gets there.

587
00:23:54,340 --> 00:23:55,220
They will be livid.

588
00:23:55,220 --> 00:23:57,700
You have to just unscrew the top and let him get in there.

589
00:23:57,700 --> 00:23:58,820
Because he will get dehydrated.

590
00:23:58,820 --> 00:23:59,700
Guys, we fucked up.

591
00:23:59,700 --> 00:24:01,220
We dumped the oats on the coach.

592
00:24:02,100 --> 00:24:03,060
Everybody look out.

593
00:24:04,900 --> 00:24:08,100
These are my victory oats and you dumped them on the coach.

594
00:24:08,100 --> 00:24:09,460
I was going to eat them afterwards.

595
00:24:10,100 --> 00:24:11,220
He's got oat fever.

596
00:24:11,220 --> 00:24:12,260
Get out of the way.

597
00:24:12,260 --> 00:24:13,540
Alternate rule set.

598
00:24:13,540 --> 00:24:15,860
Instead of having one spot reserved for the horse,

599
00:24:15,860 --> 00:24:18,020
I think that you don't have a special horse spot,

600
00:24:18,020 --> 00:24:23,060
but you do have the option to switch out as many of your human players for horse players

601
00:24:23,060 --> 00:24:27,460
as you see fit, which would be fun for like, if you're the Denver Broncos,

602
00:24:27,460 --> 00:24:32,340
you could go with a very, very literal rendition of that name.

603
00:24:33,060 --> 00:24:35,380
Maybe you have an all horse team versus an all human team,

604
00:24:35,380 --> 00:24:38,580
and we finally fucking square that out, you know?

605
00:24:38,580 --> 00:24:40,020
Guys, here's the thing though.

606
00:24:40,900 --> 00:24:42,820
This has already been prepared for.

607
00:24:43,540 --> 00:24:44,100
Oh yeah?

608
00:24:44,100 --> 00:24:46,180
The fucking Budweiser Clydesdales.

609
00:24:46,180 --> 00:24:46,660
Oh shit.

610
00:24:46,660 --> 00:24:48,180
Oh, you're right.

611
00:24:48,180 --> 00:24:50,740
They've been out there playing ball for ages.

612
00:24:50,740 --> 00:24:53,620
They're like the Jackie Robinson of horses and football.

613
00:24:53,620 --> 00:24:55,700
And who's officiating the game?

614
00:24:55,700 --> 00:24:56,500
It's a zebra.

615
00:24:59,300 --> 00:25:02,100
Can you believe they still won't allow horses in the Hall of Fame?

616
00:25:02,100 --> 00:25:02,500
I know.

617
00:25:03,140 --> 00:25:06,820
Yeah, it's just because they're not people and they won't show up to the ceremonies

618
00:25:06,820 --> 00:25:08,340
and they don't live long enough to go.

619
00:25:08,980 --> 00:25:12,020
And it doesn't mean anything to them to be accoladed.

620
00:25:12,900 --> 00:25:15,060
There's really any number of reasons.

621
00:25:15,060 --> 00:25:16,900
When they put their bronze head in,

622
00:25:16,900 --> 00:25:19,380
they just have one generic one because who can tell the difference?

623
00:25:19,380 --> 00:25:20,420
Yeah, I don't know.

624
00:25:20,420 --> 00:25:21,700
It's all racist.

625
00:25:21,700 --> 00:25:22,580
I know, right?

626
00:25:22,580 --> 00:25:25,780
Well, and also their records aren't very good.

627
00:25:26,500 --> 00:25:32,020
You know what the longest catch, the longest reception for a horse wide receiver is?

628
00:25:32,020 --> 00:25:33,060
I'm going to say none.

629
00:25:33,060 --> 00:25:33,620
No yards.

630
00:25:33,620 --> 00:25:35,140
It's not, it can't, it's not even done.

631
00:25:35,140 --> 00:25:35,780
No, you can't.

632
00:25:35,780 --> 00:25:39,220
Not a physically possible catch at catching.

633
00:25:39,940 --> 00:25:47,780
There was Sticky Four Hoof Malone who played for I believe the Raiders in 1991, I want to say.

634
00:25:47,780 --> 00:25:48,980
I was in preschool.

635
00:25:48,980 --> 00:25:49,780
Yeah, in 91.

636
00:25:50,740 --> 00:25:52,660
So anyway, they would coat the horse in tar.

637
00:25:53,460 --> 00:25:54,260
Right.

638
00:25:54,260 --> 00:25:57,860
And just sort of throw it real hard and hope that it would adhere.

639
00:25:58,420 --> 00:26:02,340
And his defensive strategy, they'd set that tar on fire and it was fucking horrible.

640
00:26:02,340 --> 00:26:02,740
Yeah.

641
00:26:02,740 --> 00:26:07,140
And also that was the year of all of the dragging deaths.

642
00:26:07,140 --> 00:26:09,380
So that was a problem.

643
00:26:09,380 --> 00:26:11,380
They originally tried to use peanut butter,

644
00:26:11,380 --> 00:26:14,340
but he was literally devoured by the other horses within minutes.

645
00:26:14,340 --> 00:26:14,900
Yeah.

646
00:26:14,900 --> 00:26:17,300
It simply, it simply was not the same.

647
00:26:17,300 --> 00:26:19,140
Do you guys ever sometimes think like, oh man,

648
00:26:19,140 --> 00:26:23,380
I want to live in this world that we've created with our imagination together.

649
00:26:24,260 --> 00:26:28,340
There is nothing I find more repellent than the world of our creation.

650
00:26:29,220 --> 00:26:32,100
There's no place I would rather out there's, no.

651
00:26:32,100 --> 00:26:36,580
You don't want to watch a sport where horses just sort of crash into each other like waves against,

652
00:26:36,580 --> 00:26:40,820
like so many waves against the rocky shores of the Pacific Northwest.

653
00:26:41,540 --> 00:26:43,380
Of all the things to replace,

654
00:26:43,380 --> 00:26:46,740
I'd rather replace some members of Dave Matthews band with horses.

655
00:26:46,740 --> 00:26:49,620
Like that's the kind of, that's where I'd like to see them at.

656
00:26:49,620 --> 00:26:52,820
Cause you would look and like something about this band, it seems odd.

657
00:26:53,620 --> 00:26:55,860
I wonder how long it would take Dave Matthews to notice.

658
00:26:55,860 --> 00:26:56,420
Yeah.

659
00:26:56,420 --> 00:26:58,260
He would literally never notice.

660
00:26:59,300 --> 00:27:01,700
You really killed it, horse violin player.

661
00:27:01,700 --> 00:27:02,900
Wait a minute.

662
00:27:02,900 --> 00:27:06,340
If he hasn't noticed, if he hasn't noticed how his music sounds right now,

663
00:27:06,340 --> 00:27:07,780
I can't imagine he's going to notice.

664
00:27:07,780 --> 00:27:09,620
He keeps forgetting to put on real pants.

665
00:27:09,620 --> 00:27:10,420
That should be enough.

666
00:27:10,420 --> 00:27:10,900
Yeah.

667
00:27:10,900 --> 00:27:13,220
If that horse can play a bassoon, it's not going to be an issue.

668
00:27:14,260 --> 00:27:15,300
He doesn't like labels.

669
00:27:16,020 --> 00:27:16,900
I have a question for you guys.

670
00:27:16,900 --> 00:27:18,420
I've been thinking of it a lot lately.

671
00:27:18,420 --> 00:27:21,460
The fact is I'm recently divorced, 29 year old woman.

672
00:27:21,460 --> 00:27:24,900
As I begin to prepare myself for the dating world by focusing on my wonderful traits,

673
00:27:24,900 --> 00:27:28,740
I can't help but dread the idea of telling future suitors that I've been married before.

674
00:27:28,740 --> 00:27:31,940
My friend told me to refer to him as my first husband,

675
00:27:31,940 --> 00:27:33,380
but I'm not sure that's the right approach.

676
00:27:33,940 --> 00:27:37,620
How and when do I tell the men out there that I've already walked down the aisle?

677
00:27:37,620 --> 00:27:39,940
That's for hoping for a re-identification.

678
00:27:39,940 --> 00:27:41,140
Hoping for a re-I do.

679
00:27:43,060 --> 00:27:45,220
I would stay away from the phrase first husband.

680
00:27:45,220 --> 00:27:45,700
Yeah.

681
00:27:45,700 --> 00:27:45,940
Yeah.

682
00:27:45,940 --> 00:27:46,580
I don't like that.

683
00:27:46,580 --> 00:27:48,340
That sounds like you're praying mantis.

684
00:27:48,340 --> 00:27:52,420
Because what it sounds like to the person you say it to is, and I'm looking for a second.

685
00:27:52,420 --> 00:27:52,900
Yeah.

686
00:27:52,900 --> 00:27:53,300
Or-

687
00:27:53,300 --> 00:27:53,620
Yeah.

688
00:27:53,620 --> 00:27:54,260
There's nothing.

689
00:27:54,260 --> 00:27:57,140
You can't say previous, my previous husband.

690
00:27:57,140 --> 00:27:58,100
Oh, my last shit.

691
00:27:59,380 --> 00:28:01,940
Have you heard my last shit?

692
00:28:01,940 --> 00:28:04,660
You could say like the scrub I was with before.

693
00:28:04,660 --> 00:28:04,900
Yeah.

694
00:28:05,700 --> 00:28:05,940
Yeah.

695
00:28:06,980 --> 00:28:07,860
That might be good.

696
00:28:07,860 --> 00:28:12,020
You really got to vilify, you really got to vilify your previous suitor.

697
00:28:13,620 --> 00:28:13,780
Yeah.

698
00:28:13,780 --> 00:28:17,620
You don't want this guy to ever question like, who's the better husband?

699
00:28:17,620 --> 00:28:18,820
Or where did I go wrong?

700
00:28:18,820 --> 00:28:22,180
Or just roll up at first day be like, it was all my fault.

701
00:28:22,180 --> 00:28:22,420
Yeah.

702
00:28:23,060 --> 00:28:23,460
Oh, no.

703
00:28:23,460 --> 00:28:23,940
Wait a minute.

704
00:28:23,940 --> 00:28:24,420
That doesn't-

705
00:28:25,060 --> 00:28:26,100
What would that help?

706
00:28:26,100 --> 00:28:27,300
What would that fix exactly?

707
00:28:27,300 --> 00:28:29,220
Just lower the expectations.

708
00:28:30,260 --> 00:28:31,460
I don't- Okay.

709
00:28:32,020 --> 00:28:36,260
Once the guy's into you, I'm not sure that would be enough to dissuade you from-

710
00:28:36,260 --> 00:28:37,060
Get rid of it, right?

711
00:28:37,060 --> 00:28:40,740
Now, when you say he's into her, yeah.

712
00:28:40,740 --> 00:28:42,260
You know what I mean?

713
00:28:42,260 --> 00:28:43,060
I don't mean fit.

714
00:28:43,060 --> 00:28:43,300
I don't-

715
00:28:46,500 --> 00:28:47,940
I'm not clear on what you're talking about.

716
00:28:51,940 --> 00:28:55,460
Though that may be a good moment to tell the truth.

717
00:28:55,460 --> 00:28:55,700
Yeah.

718
00:28:55,700 --> 00:28:56,260
Guess what?

719
00:28:57,540 --> 00:29:00,180
Hey, I know you're busy trying to cram, but-

720
00:29:01,780 --> 00:29:03,700
Let me just drop some truth on you right quick.

721
00:29:03,700 --> 00:29:09,060
I don't think that it- I really don't think this would be a huge deal on one the other, right?

722
00:29:09,060 --> 00:29:11,220
No, it's not like 1932 anymore.

723
00:29:11,220 --> 00:29:12,340
Like, who cares?

724
00:29:12,340 --> 00:29:13,300
Yeah, everybody-

725
00:29:14,100 --> 00:29:15,700
This is a good gate for you.

726
00:29:16,580 --> 00:29:18,180
This is a good bar.

727
00:29:18,180 --> 00:29:21,380
It's like a built-in bar that all of your future suitors have to clear.

728
00:29:21,380 --> 00:29:24,660
Because if they hear you say, I've been married before, and they're not like

729
00:29:25,460 --> 00:29:28,580
mature enough to handle that information, guess what?

730
00:29:29,300 --> 00:29:32,740
By the time you're like 40, everybody's been married before, basically.

731
00:29:32,740 --> 00:29:34,420
And half of them didn't work out.

732
00:29:34,420 --> 00:29:35,860
So, you're not-

733
00:29:35,860 --> 00:29:38,420
Right, and first marriages never work out.

734
00:29:38,420 --> 00:29:38,900
Yeah.

735
00:29:38,900 --> 00:29:40,020
Everybody knows that.

736
00:29:40,020 --> 00:29:40,740
Hi, sweetie.

737
00:29:40,740 --> 00:29:41,380
I'm just kidding.

738
00:29:42,260 --> 00:29:43,540
I'm just kidding, baby.

739
00:29:44,740 --> 00:29:45,300
Sorry.

740
00:29:46,500 --> 00:29:48,340
I really don't think it'll be-

741
00:29:49,060 --> 00:29:50,420
But now, when do you-

742
00:29:50,420 --> 00:29:51,460
When do you-

743
00:29:52,500 --> 00:29:54,660
I think you gotta go a few dates in before you drop that.

744
00:29:54,660 --> 00:29:55,300
Oh, definitely.

745
00:29:55,300 --> 00:29:55,800
No.

746
00:29:56,900 --> 00:29:57,620
I think you lead with-

747
00:29:57,620 --> 00:29:59,300
Unless it comes up organically.

748
00:30:00,100 --> 00:30:01,540
I think you lead with it.

749
00:30:01,540 --> 00:30:02,820
I think you lead with it.

750
00:30:03,380 --> 00:30:05,060
And I think you can organically do it.

751
00:30:05,060 --> 00:30:05,860
Like, hey, Mark.

752
00:30:05,860 --> 00:30:06,660
Oh, I mean Brian.

753
00:30:06,660 --> 00:30:07,060
Sorry.

754
00:30:07,060 --> 00:30:08,820
Mark was my husband I had once.

755
00:30:09,780 --> 00:30:13,860
No, I mean like if they ask, like if they're like, so have you ever been married before?

756
00:30:13,860 --> 00:30:16,500
Because as you said, in this day and age, it's not uncommon.

757
00:30:17,700 --> 00:30:18,740
Why would you ask that?

758
00:30:19,460 --> 00:30:19,960
Ever.

759
00:30:20,500 --> 00:30:23,060
If you're just dating somebody, you're not gonna mention marriage, period.

760
00:30:23,060 --> 00:30:27,220
But you don't think that like prior relationships come up when you're getting to know someone?

761
00:30:27,220 --> 00:30:28,100
Getting to know someone.

762
00:30:28,100 --> 00:30:31,780
I'm saying like three dates and not before.

763
00:30:31,780 --> 00:30:33,220
You do it right before you pork.

764
00:30:34,180 --> 00:30:35,140
Well, see, but this is-

765
00:30:35,140 --> 00:30:36,260
But this is my question.

766
00:30:36,260 --> 00:30:41,300
Like, for reals, can you bring it up in a way that you are not biasing the decision

767
00:30:41,300 --> 00:30:42,820
by being like, hey, we need to talk.

768
00:30:43,380 --> 00:30:44,900
I have to tell you, I was married before.

769
00:30:44,900 --> 00:30:49,300
I looked up your records at the library and I have a sneaking suspicion that you were once

770
00:30:50,260 --> 00:30:52,020
legally entangled with a Mark.

771
00:30:53,140 --> 00:30:56,340
No, I'm saying that from this, our question askers point of view,

772
00:30:56,340 --> 00:30:59,860
like how does she bring it up casually without making it a big deal?

773
00:30:59,860 --> 00:31:00,740
Because it's not.

774
00:31:00,740 --> 00:31:04,740
But I worry that by bringing it up wrong, you could make it a big deal.

775
00:31:04,740 --> 00:31:08,660
If it's your first date after you've been divorced, it's a big deal, dog.

776
00:31:08,660 --> 00:31:09,780
Like, it is.

777
00:31:09,780 --> 00:31:12,500
And you just gotta just ram right through it and get through it.

778
00:31:12,500 --> 00:31:17,540
And then if they say, oh, I'm not, I can't handle that, then they just did you the service

779
00:31:17,540 --> 00:31:22,420
of bowing out, of bowing out, you know, getting, taking themselves out.

780
00:31:22,420 --> 00:31:23,620
Because they're not ready for you.

781
00:31:23,620 --> 00:31:24,900
They're not ready for your heat.

782
00:31:24,900 --> 00:31:28,980
And another good thing is when the guy asks you how long have you been divorced,

783
00:31:28,980 --> 00:31:29,860
oh, look at your watch.

784
00:31:31,220 --> 00:31:31,780
Don't love that.

785
00:31:31,780 --> 00:31:32,340
What day is it?

786
00:31:32,340 --> 00:31:32,900
It's gonna be a good gag.

787
00:31:35,300 --> 00:31:37,940
Hold on, is this seven o'clock AM or PM?

788
00:31:38,980 --> 00:31:42,020
I can't tell because I find it really hard to focus right now.

789
00:31:42,020 --> 00:31:42,900
I just got divorced.

790
00:31:46,740 --> 00:31:50,260
Guys, girls, let the past go.

791
00:31:50,260 --> 00:31:57,380
If you're dating somebody, why does it even cross your mind how they spent the days before

792
00:31:57,380 --> 00:31:58,100
your time together?

793
00:31:58,100 --> 00:32:00,180
How is it different from, like, having ex-boyfriends?

794
00:32:00,180 --> 00:32:02,740
Now, I know that it is, but I'm just saying, why should it be?

795
00:32:04,180 --> 00:32:04,740
You know?

796
00:32:04,740 --> 00:32:07,860
Like, you were in a relationship before the relationship ended.

797
00:32:07,860 --> 00:32:09,700
Like, everyone has that story.

798
00:32:09,700 --> 00:32:12,900
I would also, but like, aren't you gonna be curious as to why it didn't work?

799
00:32:12,900 --> 00:32:17,780
I mean, if you're the guy, you know, dating a girl who got divorced,

800
00:32:17,780 --> 00:32:21,620
like, how much prying into that is, like, acceptable?

801
00:32:22,340 --> 00:32:27,380
Oh, no, I think you totally get to ask, but not for, like, six dates.

802
00:32:28,660 --> 00:32:32,980
You think six dates before you're allowed to say, like, ah, where did it go wrong?

803
00:32:32,980 --> 00:32:34,900
Yeah, so, like, what happened?

804
00:32:35,860 --> 00:32:36,580
Do you want to talk about it?

805
00:32:36,580 --> 00:32:40,180
And then you think, like, nine dates, you can start making sort of snide remarks.

806
00:32:40,180 --> 00:32:46,820
Like, oh, I bet this is why Mark got in his Jetta and just went away.

807
00:32:46,820 --> 00:32:50,020
And then, like, 12 dates and you're lonely again.

808
00:32:50,820 --> 00:32:52,500
Yeah, we had a good run, though.

809
00:32:52,500 --> 00:32:59,140
And maybe 15 dates, you just get a little drunk on Mountain Dude,

810
00:32:59,140 --> 00:33:02,980
and you call both Mark and Brian, and you put them on a three-way call,

811
00:33:02,980 --> 00:33:05,060
and you just give them both a piece of your mind.

812
00:33:05,060 --> 00:33:06,580
And you suggest a three-way.

813
00:33:06,580 --> 00:33:09,940
And then maybe 50 first dates with Adam Sandler.

814
00:33:11,220 --> 00:33:14,820
Brian, tell Mark what you're doing different from what Mark did,

815
00:33:14,820 --> 00:33:17,780
because Mark's always asking, where did he go wrong?

816
00:33:17,780 --> 00:33:18,740
I like Brian better.

817
00:33:18,740 --> 00:33:21,460
So, Brian, tell Mark what you're doing that's so much better.

818
00:33:21,460 --> 00:33:24,500
I'm just going to cut out the middleman and let you two hash it out

819
00:33:24,500 --> 00:33:26,660
so that he can be better than you ever were.

820
00:33:26,660 --> 00:33:28,420
Yeah, fight for my honor.

821
00:33:29,700 --> 00:33:31,140
Will you two fist fight each other?

822
00:33:33,300 --> 00:33:34,820
I used to be married.

823
00:33:35,780 --> 00:33:36,900
Oh, yeah, what happened?

824
00:33:36,900 --> 00:33:39,940
Well, I'm going to trick you into killing my husband.

825
00:33:39,940 --> 00:33:42,900
So, I mean, my tense is optimistic.

826
00:33:42,900 --> 00:33:44,340
Let's put it that way.

827
00:33:44,340 --> 00:33:49,300
I used to have a husband, and if you want to get lucky tonight,

828
00:33:49,300 --> 00:33:52,100
I'm going to need you to go to his house and burn it down or something.

829
00:33:52,100 --> 00:33:53,460
Just make it look like an accident.

830
00:33:53,460 --> 00:33:54,740
I really want this to work between us.

831
00:33:54,740 --> 00:33:55,700
Are you a Sagittarius?

832
00:33:55,700 --> 00:33:57,460
You seem like a Sagittarius.

833
00:33:57,460 --> 00:33:58,020
This is great.

834
00:33:58,020 --> 00:33:59,300
This is great bisque.

835
00:33:59,300 --> 00:34:00,580
Thanks for taking me to Fizzoli's.

836
00:34:02,180 --> 00:34:04,180
Have you guys had Fizzoli's new bisque?

837
00:34:04,180 --> 00:34:05,540
Yeah, the ravioli bisque.

838
00:34:06,580 --> 00:34:07,860
So, do you have a new bisque?

839
00:34:07,860 --> 00:34:15,140
It's so great, you just dip that stupid, wet, stinky ass bread up in it,

840
00:34:15,140 --> 00:34:18,900
and then you soak it, you wring it out like a squeegee, right in your mouth.

841
00:34:18,900 --> 00:34:20,100
And then you propose murder.

842
00:34:20,100 --> 00:34:24,660
And then you just say you want, if something were to happen to Brian,

843
00:34:24,660 --> 00:34:28,500
wouldn't be completely unaroused.

844
00:34:28,500 --> 00:34:29,940
Just put it that way.

845
00:34:31,060 --> 00:34:33,620
I would not become more flaccid inside,

846
00:34:33,620 --> 00:34:36,900
or whatever the female equivalent of flaccidity is.

847
00:34:36,900 --> 00:34:38,900
My vagina is fully erect right now.

848
00:34:38,900 --> 00:34:41,220
Griffin, female arousal is a myth.

849
00:34:41,220 --> 00:34:42,260
Let's go to the money zone.

850
00:34:53,940 --> 00:34:55,460
Who's this message for?

851
00:34:55,460 --> 00:34:56,900
Well, Michael Williams.

852
00:34:56,900 --> 00:34:58,100
So glad you asked, Griffin.

853
00:34:59,540 --> 00:35:00,500
Who's it from?

854
00:35:00,500 --> 00:35:01,940
Well, Sarah Bags.

855
00:35:02,580 --> 00:35:05,380
She says, happy birthday to my awesome fiancee,

856
00:35:05,380 --> 00:35:08,260
who's turning the big 3-0 on September 9th.

857
00:35:08,260 --> 00:35:09,140
Oops.

858
00:35:09,140 --> 00:35:10,580
He is the greatest guy ever.

859
00:35:11,620 --> 00:35:12,660
Sorry, I missed it.

860
00:35:12,660 --> 00:35:15,380
He's the greatest guy ever, and he loves my bim-bam-bam,

861
00:35:15,380 --> 00:35:20,420
which he introduced to me, so on my work commute wouldn't suck.

862
00:35:20,420 --> 00:35:25,780
So, that's from Sarah to Michael, Big Mike, to his friends and co-workers.

863
00:35:25,780 --> 00:35:26,420
Captain Mike.

864
00:35:26,980 --> 00:35:28,660
Captain Mike, they call him.

865
00:35:28,660 --> 00:35:32,580
Mike Rofone, they call him sometimes.

866
00:35:32,580 --> 00:35:33,540
Big Willy.

867
00:35:33,540 --> 00:35:33,780
Mike.

868
00:35:33,780 --> 00:35:34,820
Big Willy style.

869
00:35:34,820 --> 00:35:37,300
Because his last name is Williams.

870
00:35:37,300 --> 00:35:38,660
Michael Williams.

871
00:35:38,660 --> 00:35:39,380
Mike the Bike.

872
00:35:39,940 --> 00:35:41,620
Mike the Bike, it's his big day.

873
00:35:42,420 --> 00:35:43,060
Hey.

874
00:35:43,060 --> 00:35:43,780
Boss Cock.

875
00:35:44,820 --> 00:35:46,740
Boss Cock Michael Williams.

876
00:35:48,260 --> 00:35:51,060
I just gave that dude a nickname that he's gonna have forever.

877
00:35:52,660 --> 00:35:56,340
So, Michael, you have any nicknames around the office?

878
00:35:56,340 --> 00:35:58,340
I have one I don't really like to talk about.

879
00:35:58,340 --> 00:35:59,540
An internet gave it to me.

880
00:36:00,420 --> 00:36:02,500
An internet gave it to me.

881
00:36:02,500 --> 00:36:05,380
It is Boss Cock.

882
00:36:05,380 --> 00:36:06,180
Like Boss Hog?

883
00:36:06,180 --> 00:36:06,980
Yeah, I guess.

884
00:36:07,700 --> 00:36:09,780
Yeah, I guess that's what they were going for.

885
00:36:09,780 --> 00:36:10,900
It wasn't a good episode.

886
00:36:10,900 --> 00:36:13,300
The internet was a little hung over when he said it.

887
00:36:13,300 --> 00:36:14,900
So, it probably made sense.

888
00:36:16,580 --> 00:36:19,540
One third of the internet took some Benadryl before the show

889
00:36:19,540 --> 00:36:20,900
because his allergies flared up.

890
00:36:21,540 --> 00:36:23,940
So, he was a little out of it when he said Boss Cock, I think.

891
00:36:26,180 --> 00:36:27,700
Hey, do you guys love beats?

892
00:36:28,420 --> 00:36:29,140
All the beats.

893
00:36:29,140 --> 00:36:30,180
Rap and beats?

894
00:36:30,180 --> 00:36:33,700
Wait, B-E-E-T-S or B-E-E-L-A?

895
00:36:33,700 --> 00:36:35,380
No, not like Killer Tofu.

896
00:36:35,380 --> 00:36:36,740
I mean like rap and beats.

897
00:36:36,740 --> 00:36:39,780
B-E-E-E-E-E-E-T-S.

898
00:36:39,780 --> 00:36:40,580
Beats!

899
00:36:40,580 --> 00:36:47,380
I want to tell you guys about the debut mixtape from our boy, J-Phonic.

900
00:36:47,380 --> 00:36:49,220
Oh, shit.

901
00:36:49,220 --> 00:36:52,180
Chrono-grammaticist, the J-Phonic mixtape.

902
00:36:52,740 --> 00:36:58,420
You can get that for free at J-Phonic.

903
00:36:58,420 --> 00:37:00,260
What a deal.

904
00:37:00,260 --> 00:37:00,740
I know.

905
00:37:00,740 --> 00:37:04,660
At J-P-H-O-N-I-C mixtape dot com.

906
00:37:04,660 --> 00:37:07,220
That's J-Phonic mixtape dot com.

907
00:37:07,220 --> 00:37:09,620
You can get it for free.

908
00:37:09,620 --> 00:37:12,420
He's an alternative hip hop artist and friend of the show.

909
00:37:12,420 --> 00:37:18,500
It's his debut album and it's not only ultra dope, but it's also totally completely free.

910
00:37:18,500 --> 00:37:23,620
It's got some nerdy songs, got some West Coast flavor, I think, is in there.

911
00:37:25,620 --> 00:37:27,140
It's completely sugar free.

912
00:37:27,140 --> 00:37:27,780
Free.

913
00:37:27,780 --> 00:37:39,860
And I've heard J-Phonic on the MIC, not to get me confused with the M-I-C-H-A-E-L-B-O-S-S-C-O-C-K-W-I-L-L-I-A-M-S.

914
00:37:39,860 --> 00:37:42,180
That's Michael Boscock Williams you're thinking of.

915
00:37:42,180 --> 00:37:44,740
I'm talking about the MIC that you rap into.

916
00:37:44,740 --> 00:37:45,300
Correct.

917
00:37:45,300 --> 00:37:51,140
But when he puts sounds from his mouth into that thing and they go through the electronics

918
00:37:51,140 --> 00:37:53,220
and come into my ears, I like it.

919
00:37:53,220 --> 00:37:54,180
I like what happens.

920
00:37:54,180 --> 00:38:00,260
Um, if you want to experience some of Bim Bam related J-Phonic heat, remember he did

921
00:38:00,260 --> 00:38:03,140
like two intros for us back in the day.

922
00:38:03,860 --> 00:38:04,500
Do you remember this?

923
00:38:04,500 --> 00:38:05,460
Yeah, back in the Dizzy.

924
00:38:05,460 --> 00:38:06,900
Yes, yes I do.

925
00:38:06,900 --> 00:38:08,180
He did at least one outro.

926
00:38:08,180 --> 00:38:10,580
I can't remember the episodes, but he's-

927
00:38:10,580 --> 00:38:12,180
Go back and listen to all of them and find it.

928
00:38:12,180 --> 00:38:18,500
Yeah, it's only, I'm not gonna lie, it's gonna take 120 hours, but I think it's worth it.

929
00:38:20,740 --> 00:38:21,780
Happy birthday, Jordan.

930
00:38:21,780 --> 00:38:23,460
Happy birthday.

931
00:38:23,460 --> 00:38:25,860
Happy birthday, J-Phonic.

932
00:38:26,980 --> 00:38:28,500
Oh, are we not allowed to unmask?

933
00:38:28,500 --> 00:38:29,860
Did I just like unmask the luchador?

934
00:38:29,860 --> 00:38:31,380
He just like unmasked him, yeah.

935
00:38:32,820 --> 00:38:35,060
Go to jphonicmixtape.com.

936
00:38:35,060 --> 00:38:37,780
Might as well tell everyone that Deadmau5's real name is Francis.

937
00:38:39,380 --> 00:38:41,780
Francis, what are you doing on that stage?

938
00:38:43,540 --> 00:38:45,540
Ma, I'm trying to make some beats.

939
00:38:46,340 --> 00:38:47,540
That's not music.

940
00:38:47,540 --> 00:38:50,100
I, whatever happened to Rudy Valli?

941
00:38:50,100 --> 00:38:51,780
Ma, go home.

942
00:38:53,380 --> 00:38:56,900
You look like a big old cyborg Mickey Mouse or something up there.

943
00:38:56,900 --> 00:38:57,780
What are you doing?

944
00:38:58,660 --> 00:39:00,420
Ma, I told you I'm working.

945
00:39:02,420 --> 00:39:03,460
That ain't a job.

946
00:39:03,460 --> 00:39:06,980
Get back to the diner and help your father clean up the hamburger slop.

947
00:39:07,860 --> 00:39:10,500
He's not well and we're all waiting for the drop.

948
00:39:11,140 --> 00:39:11,940
Give it to us.

949
00:39:11,940 --> 00:39:13,540
Give us that high beat.

950
00:39:13,540 --> 00:39:14,820
That stinky drop.

951
00:39:16,180 --> 00:39:18,580
Give us that fat nasty bass.

952
00:39:18,580 --> 00:39:20,260
We're all waiting for it.

953
00:39:20,260 --> 00:39:24,180
We all got, your grandpa's gonna die before you drop that fat bass on us.

954
00:39:28,900 --> 00:39:33,780
Your cousin Skrillex would never make us wait this long for a fat nasty drop.

955
00:39:45,940 --> 00:39:46,980
Oh, Jesus.

956
00:39:46,980 --> 00:39:49,620
Francis, my high is peaking.

957
00:39:50,260 --> 00:39:51,460
I'm about to come down.

958
00:39:52,100 --> 00:39:53,700
I got my hands in the air.

959
00:39:53,700 --> 00:39:54,260
I'm ready.

960
00:39:55,060 --> 00:39:55,540
Drop it.

961
00:39:56,900 --> 00:39:57,940
Oh God.

962
00:39:57,940 --> 00:40:00,660
Your father worked all day to synthesize this X.

963
00:40:04,820 --> 00:40:08,340
My neon glow bracelets are losing the luminosity, Francis.

964
00:40:08,340 --> 00:40:17,940
Francis, they're closing the JCC at 7 PM.

965
00:40:17,940 --> 00:40:19,380
All these people have to get out.

966
00:40:19,380 --> 00:40:20,260
Just drop it.

967
00:40:21,220 --> 00:40:22,100
Drop the beat.

968
00:40:30,900 --> 00:40:32,980
So do you like to stick things in your penis?

969
00:40:34,420 --> 00:40:35,940
How's your boss cock doing?

970
00:40:35,940 --> 00:40:38,500
How's your boss cock doing, because boy howdy.

971
00:40:38,500 --> 00:40:39,620
Do I have a site for you?

972
00:40:39,620 --> 00:40:41,380
It's ExtremeRestraints.com.

973
00:40:41,380 --> 00:40:43,940
To be fair, it also caters to middle management cocks.

974
00:40:44,500 --> 00:40:49,780
Yeah, whatever kind of equipment you're working with down there, it has got you under control.

975
00:40:51,140 --> 00:40:55,780
If you like enema supplies, you want to get everything working out down there,

976
00:40:55,780 --> 00:40:57,220
is that part of your play?

977
00:40:57,220 --> 00:40:58,420
They've got it for you.

978
00:40:58,420 --> 00:41:03,060
Fetish clothing, you want to wrap yourself up in a latex or something?

979
00:41:03,620 --> 00:41:04,340
You can do that.

980
00:41:04,340 --> 00:41:08,660
They've got sexy lingerie too for the ladies, or the men.

981
00:41:08,660 --> 00:41:09,220
Who cares?

982
00:41:09,780 --> 00:41:11,700
Fucking machines, they've got them.

983
00:41:11,700 --> 00:41:13,300
We should've got a dick on a big ball.

984
00:41:14,420 --> 00:41:14,980
God bless.

985
00:41:14,980 --> 00:41:15,780
They've got everything.

986
00:41:15,780 --> 00:41:22,900
I love how the more we do work with our advertising partners at Extreme Restraints,

987
00:41:22,900 --> 00:41:27,540
the more sort of laissez-faire approach to fucking we've begun to adopt.

988
00:41:28,420 --> 00:41:30,260
What do you just put that in?

989
00:41:30,260 --> 00:41:31,620
What do you just do it?

990
00:41:31,620 --> 00:41:34,420
What do you just do it? I don't give a fuck.

991
00:41:34,420 --> 00:41:41,380
Yeah, it has reinvented really my ideas of the norm.

992
00:41:41,380 --> 00:41:43,700
I literally do not exist anymore.

993
00:41:43,700 --> 00:41:44,900
And you know what?

994
00:41:46,180 --> 00:41:48,420
You should open yourself up to some new stuff.

995
00:41:48,420 --> 00:41:49,140
Why not?

996
00:41:49,140 --> 00:41:49,700
Literally.

997
00:41:51,060 --> 00:41:54,900
Literally, open up your orifice and put something new in there.

998
00:41:54,900 --> 00:41:56,180
I'm not joking, you guys.

999
00:41:56,180 --> 00:41:58,820
Every time I go to ExtremeRestraints.com, it strikes me a lot.

1000
00:41:58,820 --> 00:42:02,500
It strikes you over and over again because that's the only way you can finish.

1001
00:42:02,500 --> 00:42:03,460
That's true.

1002
00:42:03,460 --> 00:42:08,420
I also imagine that working there is like a sex toy Willy Wonka shop.

1003
00:42:08,420 --> 00:42:09,940
Oh, man.

1004
00:42:09,940 --> 00:42:12,900
Like the world of pure imagination.

1005
00:42:12,900 --> 00:42:14,020
Come on, children.

1006
00:42:14,020 --> 00:42:16,900
I'm just saying that after a while-

1007
00:42:16,900 --> 00:42:17,860
I've chosen six of you.

1008
00:42:17,860 --> 00:42:23,060
It's gotta not be so shocking that there's a chocolate river and some Oompa Loompas.

1009
00:42:23,060 --> 00:42:24,580
Ew, what's in there?

1010
00:42:24,580 --> 00:42:25,940
It's getting weird.

1011
00:42:25,940 --> 00:42:28,980
Now it's getting weird.

1012
00:42:28,980 --> 00:42:30,420
It started weird.

1013
00:42:30,420 --> 00:42:31,540
It started weird?

1014
00:42:31,540 --> 00:42:36,660
If you have the coupon code MIDDLEST, you can save 20% M-I-D-D-L-E-S-T.

1015
00:42:36,660 --> 00:42:38,100
You can save 20% there.

1016
00:42:38,100 --> 00:42:39,060
It's all discreet.

1017
00:42:41,460 --> 00:42:43,620
And try something new.

1018
00:42:43,620 --> 00:42:48,260
I'm willing to bet there's something there that will knock your socks off.

1019
00:42:49,380 --> 00:42:50,740
Yeah, they have the sock knocker offer.

1020
00:42:51,540 --> 00:42:53,140
And the cock socks are knocks are offer.

1021
00:42:53,140 --> 00:42:56,420
Did you say knock your cocks off, because that may be a little too extreme.

1022
00:42:56,420 --> 00:42:57,620
Get your rocks off.

1023
00:42:57,620 --> 00:42:59,220
Get your rocks off by cutting your cock off.

1024
00:42:59,220 --> 00:43:02,420
Do they have a sister site called Extreme Extreme Restraints?

1025
00:43:02,980 --> 00:43:03,620
Or just possibly-

1026
00:43:03,620 --> 00:43:05,220
They do have mild boring restraints.

1027
00:43:05,220 --> 00:43:07,540
Fucking seriously, guys, no joke.

1028
00:43:08,660 --> 00:43:11,140
These restraints are pretty goddamn extreme.

1029
00:43:11,140 --> 00:43:16,820
If you go to boring restraints, you can tie yourself up with wet spaghetti, tissue paper.

1030
00:43:17,460 --> 00:43:18,100
Promises.

1031
00:43:18,100 --> 00:43:22,980
And then at Extreme Extreme Restraints, a man will come to your house and beat you to death.

1032
00:43:25,780 --> 00:43:26,180
That site-

1033
00:43:26,180 --> 00:43:28,740
So find the happy medium at ExtremeRestraints.com.

1034
00:43:28,740 --> 00:43:36,020
Extreme Extreme Restraints, you can find it at AbandonAllHopeYeeHooEnterHere.com, oh,.net.

1035
00:43:36,020 --> 00:43:37,380
They didn't secure the.com rights.

1036
00:43:38,580 --> 00:43:39,540
What's your safe word?

1037
00:43:40,100 --> 00:43:40,500
I don't know.

1038
00:43:40,500 --> 00:43:41,140
They don't know.

1039
00:43:41,140 --> 00:43:41,780
They don't have those.

1040
00:43:41,780 --> 00:43:43,700
Yeah, they've got danger words.

1041
00:43:43,700 --> 00:43:48,900
You just say it when you just want the pain to be over.

1042
00:43:48,900 --> 00:43:51,540
Dear brothers McElroy, help.

1043
00:43:52,180 --> 00:43:53,780
A few months ago, I started dating this girl.

1044
00:43:53,780 --> 00:43:56,980
She's cute and funny, but I'm just not feeling it anymore.

1045
00:43:56,980 --> 00:43:58,020
So I think it's time to end it.

1046
00:43:58,740 --> 00:44:01,780
We're not gonna do it for you, if that's what you're building up to.

1047
00:44:01,780 --> 00:44:02,740
So let me cut you off there.

1048
00:44:03,540 --> 00:44:08,980
My birthday's coming up this weekend, and she had been executing this elaborate plot of telling me

1049
00:44:08,980 --> 00:44:11,540
one thing she likes about me each day until my birthday.

1050
00:44:11,540 --> 00:44:12,180
Oh, man.

1051
00:44:12,180 --> 00:44:14,980
Oh, you really had, you couldn't keep this to yourself.

1052
00:44:14,980 --> 00:44:17,060
You had to dump this on us and all of our listeners.

1053
00:44:17,060 --> 00:44:18,100
Thank you.

1054
00:44:18,100 --> 00:44:19,700
Culminating in some surprise.

1055
00:44:20,420 --> 00:44:24,340
I don't know if it's better to end it now or wiser to wait.

1056
00:44:24,340 --> 00:44:25,300
Help me out here.

1057
00:44:26,100 --> 00:44:27,780
Confusion in Kansas.

1058
00:44:27,780 --> 00:44:29,860
You've got a surprise coming your way.

1059
00:44:30,420 --> 00:44:30,980
So do you.

1060
00:44:30,980 --> 00:44:35,460
You've got a, I think that's the answer.

1061
00:44:35,460 --> 00:44:40,980
Now every day tell her something you don't like about her and build up to a surprise of your own.

1062
00:44:40,980 --> 00:44:46,340
I haven't been surprised by anything in probably 14 years.

1063
00:44:47,540 --> 00:44:50,900
Probably since I got a PlayStation for Christmas, and I didn't think I was gonna get one.

1064
00:44:52,020 --> 00:44:57,460
So to have a genuine surprise in your life, you gotta play that out.

1065
00:44:58,500 --> 00:45:01,140
Yeah, it's a bad, cause what if she will never tell you?

1066
00:45:01,700 --> 00:45:03,140
And then I'll just haunt you forever.

1067
00:45:03,140 --> 00:45:04,260
Like, so what was it?

1068
00:45:04,260 --> 00:45:06,740
Oh, I can't say.

1069
00:45:06,740 --> 00:45:07,700
It'd be too hard.

1070
00:45:07,700 --> 00:45:14,980
But what if the surprise is like, I got your name tattooed on me or like, I bought you this car.

1071
00:45:16,260 --> 00:45:16,660
Well, that's.

1072
00:45:17,620 --> 00:45:19,540
No, that one doesn't bother you as much.

1073
00:45:19,540 --> 00:45:20,580
Not so much.

1074
00:45:22,820 --> 00:45:25,220
This is what we call in the biz a bad beat.

1075
00:45:25,860 --> 00:45:33,700
And if you end it now, it's just gonna be rough.

1076
00:45:33,700 --> 00:45:34,020
Yeah.

1077
00:45:34,020 --> 00:45:39,220
And it's not gonna be, I mean, it's gonna be bad, but I don't think it makes you the bad guy.

1078
00:45:39,220 --> 00:45:40,500
Yeah, don't push the river here.

1079
00:45:40,500 --> 00:45:42,820
You gotta get out if you got the opportunity.

1080
00:45:43,540 --> 00:45:44,340
You gotta fold.

1081
00:45:44,340 --> 00:45:45,620
You gotta fold them.

1082
00:45:45,620 --> 00:45:46,180
And don't chase them.

1083
00:45:46,180 --> 00:45:47,380
You gotta know when to hold them.

1084
00:45:47,380 --> 00:45:48,260
Don't chase that rainbow.

1085
00:45:48,260 --> 00:45:51,860
Travis, if you finish that phrase, I don't know what I'll do.

1086
00:45:54,100 --> 00:45:56,100
Know when to walk.

1087
00:45:56,100 --> 00:45:57,140
I'm trying to stop.

1088
00:45:57,140 --> 00:45:57,940
Yeah, it's real easy.

1089
00:45:59,380 --> 00:46:01,620
Can I also just give another suggestion?

1090
00:46:01,620 --> 00:46:06,020
And it's actually more of an exclamation or perhaps an interrogative.

1091
00:46:06,020 --> 00:46:07,380
Why are you breaking up with this girl?

1092
00:46:07,380 --> 00:46:08,660
She sounds super sweet.

1093
00:46:09,380 --> 00:46:10,500
Yeah, she sounds really sweet.

1094
00:46:10,500 --> 00:46:12,260
It sounds like a real nice thing that she's doing.

1095
00:46:13,300 --> 00:46:16,020
Yeah, I think she's probably pretty great.

1096
00:46:16,020 --> 00:46:17,380
I would stick with it.

1097
00:46:17,380 --> 00:46:18,820
At least so you find out what the surprise is.

1098
00:46:18,820 --> 00:46:22,820
And if the surprise sucks, end it because of that and let her know that's why.

1099
00:46:23,540 --> 00:46:26,340
Sometimes, listen, I'll break it down for you.

1100
00:46:26,340 --> 00:46:32,260
Sometimes, if you're with somebody for long enough, even if you don't like them at first

1101
00:46:32,260 --> 00:46:37,700
and you spend a lot of time with them, then eventually down the road, you might find that

1102
00:46:37,700 --> 00:46:38,420
you care about them.

1103
00:46:38,420 --> 00:46:42,100
Or at least that's what I keep telling my wife.

1104
00:46:42,100 --> 00:46:43,860
Oh, Justin.

1105
00:46:43,860 --> 00:46:46,420
I'm hoping that things are going to show.

1106
00:46:50,740 --> 00:46:51,780
Bringing it down.

1107
00:46:51,780 --> 00:46:53,380
We were having some goofs.

1108
00:46:53,380 --> 00:46:56,500
We were making some laughs, and now they're dead.

1109
00:46:58,820 --> 00:47:03,780
Hey, can we, every time we do an episode, can we say one nice thing about each other?

1110
00:47:04,820 --> 00:47:05,780
Just something sweet.

1111
00:47:05,780 --> 00:47:08,820
Justin, your ceviche is the best ceviche I've had.

1112
00:47:08,820 --> 00:47:12,900
And Travis, the muscles in your hands are really big.

1113
00:47:13,700 --> 00:47:14,020
Thank you.

1114
00:47:14,020 --> 00:47:15,620
I've never made ceviche for you.

1115
00:47:16,340 --> 00:47:18,020
I don't know why you would say things like that.

1116
00:47:18,020 --> 00:47:19,380
You have made ceviche for me before.

1117
00:47:19,380 --> 00:47:19,940
It's really good.

1118
00:47:19,940 --> 00:47:20,580
I have not.

1119
00:47:20,580 --> 00:47:21,460
I have not made ceviche for you before.

1120
00:47:21,460 --> 00:47:24,020
You made me ceviche shrimp once.

1121
00:47:24,020 --> 00:47:26,180
I did not make you ceviche shrimp once, but thank you.

1122
00:47:26,180 --> 00:47:28,420
You made, I fucking ate ceviche.

1123
00:47:28,420 --> 00:47:31,140
Were those just raw shrimp I was eating out of your refrigerator?

1124
00:47:31,940 --> 00:47:34,260
Did I tell you guys about the text that I got from dad?

1125
00:47:34,980 --> 00:47:38,180
I got a text from dad, this was like three weeks ago.

1126
00:47:38,180 --> 00:47:41,380
It was maybe 8 p.m. on a Saturday night.

1127
00:47:41,380 --> 00:47:46,820
And I get a text from our shared dad that says, try ceviche.

1128
00:47:48,260 --> 00:47:50,660
Just apropos of nothing.

1129
00:47:50,660 --> 00:47:54,180
Matt, Clint's just like, hey, try ceviche.

1130
00:47:54,180 --> 00:47:54,740
All right, dad.

1131
00:47:57,220 --> 00:47:57,780
Like now?

1132
00:47:57,780 --> 00:47:58,980
I was thinking of putting it off.

1133
00:47:58,980 --> 00:48:00,260
I was thinking of putting it off.

1134
00:48:00,260 --> 00:48:01,780
This has gone far enough.

1135
00:48:01,780 --> 00:48:02,740
Try ceviche.

1136
00:48:02,740 --> 00:48:07,940
Do you think our dad, do you think he confused like his text message app and his notes app?

1137
00:48:07,940 --> 00:48:09,460
He's like, I got to send this.

1138
00:48:09,460 --> 00:48:10,260
I'm going to forget this.

1139
00:48:10,260 --> 00:48:11,380
Got to put it in the cloud.

1140
00:48:12,580 --> 00:48:13,460
Oh, fuck.

1141
00:48:14,500 --> 00:48:15,140
That's good.

1142
00:48:16,580 --> 00:48:17,220
Oh, man.

1143
00:48:17,220 --> 00:48:24,420
And just so you guys know, of course, our listening audience won't be able to enjoy this.

1144
00:48:24,420 --> 00:48:26,340
But just so you guys know, I'm not fucking with you.

1145
00:48:26,340 --> 00:48:30,980
I'm going to send you a screen cap that I just took.

1146
00:48:32,020 --> 00:48:34,340
Here are the things that my dad texted me about.

1147
00:48:35,620 --> 00:48:39,860
One, premiere dates for shows that we both enjoy.

1148
00:48:39,860 --> 00:48:41,300
This can be helpful sometimes.

1149
00:48:41,300 --> 00:48:42,740
So I appreciate that.

1150
00:48:42,740 --> 00:48:45,140
Two, and I don't know if you guys get these too.

1151
00:48:45,140 --> 00:48:46,980
I don't know if you guys are on this mailing list.

1152
00:48:46,980 --> 00:48:52,740
But when somebody dies, like a celebrity dies, I always get a text message from dad.

1153
00:48:52,740 --> 00:48:57,940
And it's nice that he's almost the emotional pace car for these kinds of things.

1154
00:48:57,940 --> 00:49:04,900
Because he lets you know that, yes, this person did just die.

1155
00:49:04,900 --> 00:49:08,020
But it's cool to drop a goof in here.

1156
00:49:08,020 --> 00:49:12,580
For instance, August 20, 2012, and somewhere Fang is crying.

1157
00:49:12,580 --> 00:49:13,060
What was that?

1158
00:49:13,060 --> 00:49:18,740
Uh-huh, that was a reference to, I think, Carol Channing dying, maybe.

1159
00:49:19,460 --> 00:49:20,340
Phyllis Diller dying.

1160
00:49:21,220 --> 00:49:23,860
It was a reference to Carol Channing killing Phyllis Diller.

1161
00:49:25,620 --> 00:49:27,780
Explain to me about hashtags on Twitter.

1162
00:49:30,340 --> 00:49:31,060
Oh, how about this?

1163
00:49:31,060 --> 00:49:32,500
Oh, this is a classic Jim.

1164
00:49:32,500 --> 00:49:33,540
He's moving on up.

1165
00:49:35,380 --> 00:49:36,660
That was when Mr. Jefferson died.

1166
00:49:36,660 --> 00:49:38,180
Priceless, priceless.

1167
00:49:38,180 --> 00:49:38,680
Priceless.

1168
00:49:39,460 --> 00:49:40,180
So good.

1169
00:49:40,180 --> 00:49:42,180
Dad doesn't text me.

1170
00:49:42,180 --> 00:49:48,820
It must be lovely to have a close relationship with your father.

1171
00:49:48,820 --> 00:49:50,020
Actually, I got a text about that.

1172
00:49:50,020 --> 00:49:51,780
Sad I'm not texting Travis anymore.

1173
00:49:51,780 --> 00:49:53,940
He just keeps texting me and calling me Travis Snow.

1174
00:49:54,500 --> 00:49:55,700
And I don't know why.

1175
00:49:55,700 --> 00:49:57,540
July 3, 2012.

1176
00:49:57,540 --> 00:50:00,180
I hope Aunt B had him a big old pie waiting.

1177
00:50:00,180 --> 00:50:01,700
That's when Andy Griffith died.

1178
00:50:01,700 --> 00:50:03,380
I got that one on August 10.

1179
00:50:03,380 --> 00:50:05,300
Big thumbs up on new pizza place.

1180
00:50:07,060 --> 00:50:08,660
That's not somebody dying.

1181
00:50:08,660 --> 00:50:10,340
No, but it was really random.

1182
00:50:10,340 --> 00:50:12,980
We've not spoken about a pizza place prior to that.

1183
00:50:12,980 --> 00:50:14,980
I don't even know what pizza place he was talking about.

1184
00:50:15,700 --> 00:50:16,980
Here's here's another one.

1185
00:50:16,980 --> 00:50:20,020
And this is I do not know where he was when he said this.

1186
00:50:20,020 --> 00:50:21,380
He was going on vacation.

1187
00:50:21,380 --> 00:50:23,860
But this is the exact text I got from our dad.

1188
00:50:24,500 --> 00:50:27,380
We finally got here and Richard Gere can blow me.

1189
00:50:30,020 --> 00:50:32,100
That was from his shitty vacation in Rodin.

1190
00:50:33,620 --> 00:50:34,660
How about this, Jim?

1191
00:50:34,660 --> 00:50:36,020
Oh, can we do this every week?

1192
00:50:36,020 --> 00:50:37,220
This is so great.

1193
00:50:37,220 --> 00:50:39,460
French French steward on community.

1194
00:50:39,460 --> 00:50:40,020
Brilliant.

1195
00:50:42,580 --> 00:50:45,540
That says here's one July 17th.

1196
00:50:45,540 --> 00:50:46,820
We lost Donald Sobel.

1197
00:50:46,820 --> 00:50:51,540
That is, of course, Donald Sobel, author of Encyclopedia Brown books.

1198
00:50:53,300 --> 00:50:53,940
Oh, man.

1199
00:50:55,940 --> 00:50:59,860
After his after his vacation, we are home.

1200
00:50:59,860 --> 00:51:00,740
Don't get the tuna.

1201
00:51:01,540 --> 00:51:03,860
What place?

1202
00:51:03,860 --> 00:51:05,620
Hey, Dad, I love you very much.

1203
00:51:05,620 --> 00:51:08,900
Um, don't have the tuna and do try ceviche.

1204
00:51:11,540 --> 00:51:12,420
You're the best.

1205
00:51:12,420 --> 00:51:12,900
Thanks, Dad.

1206
00:51:12,900 --> 00:51:15,700
I love you so much that your text light up my life.

1207
00:51:15,700 --> 00:51:16,660
He's not a man.

1208
00:51:17,460 --> 00:51:19,540
These texts, us reading them out.

1209
00:51:19,540 --> 00:51:20,980
They're the poorest representation.

1210
00:51:20,980 --> 00:51:21,620
They are.

1211
00:51:21,620 --> 00:51:26,260
They make him sound completely incompetent when he's actually he's a very, very smart man.

1212
00:51:26,980 --> 00:51:33,060
I just don't think he understands the medium, much like I don't think anybody over the age of 43 dies.

1213
00:51:33,060 --> 00:51:35,140
Uh, listen, I'm 31.

1214
00:51:35,140 --> 00:51:38,420
So I'm going to have to lower that bar to like 30 because I don't get it either.

1215
00:51:38,420 --> 00:51:42,100
I don't understand what these these kids are talking about with emojis.

1216
00:51:43,700 --> 00:51:44,740
I don't get it.

1217
00:51:44,740 --> 00:51:47,860
You know what I'm going to tell you a truth.

1218
00:51:47,860 --> 00:51:49,220
Do you guys know what emojis are?

1219
00:51:49,860 --> 00:51:58,020
No emojis are like the little icons that are all like all Japanese

1220
00:51:58,020 --> 00:52:00,340
phones support them and more phones are starting to support them here.

1221
00:52:00,340 --> 00:52:04,180
But they're they're basically icons that are like emoticons.

1222
00:52:04,180 --> 00:52:08,580
But they're actually like little pictures that you can use to convey emotion as part of your text.

1223
00:52:09,860 --> 00:52:10,420
So they're high.

1224
00:52:10,420 --> 00:52:11,940
They are highbrow emoticons.

1225
00:52:12,740 --> 00:52:14,980
They're highbrow, highfalutin emoticons.

1226
00:52:14,980 --> 00:52:16,260
They're next gen emoticons.

1227
00:52:16,260 --> 00:52:17,540
Okay, they're next gen emoticons.

1228
00:52:17,540 --> 00:52:18,420
They're called emojis.

1229
00:52:18,980 --> 00:52:24,420
And true story for about three months after I first heard the term.

1230
00:52:24,420 --> 00:52:26,820
I thought it was a fun slang for emotions.

1231
00:52:26,820 --> 00:52:31,220
Like I'm feels the powerful emojis, you guys are guys.

1232
00:52:31,220 --> 00:52:32,900
I feel so many emojis right now.

1233
00:52:33,700 --> 00:52:37,380
So I'd like to try to repurpose that for that purpose.

1234
00:52:37,380 --> 00:52:41,300
Could we maybe get could we maybe get Destiny's Child together to do a

1235
00:52:42,740 --> 00:52:44,020
remake of their song emotions?

1236
00:52:44,020 --> 00:52:45,300
What the fuck is what?

1237
00:52:46,100 --> 00:52:46,660
How is that?

1238
00:52:47,380 --> 00:52:47,780
What about?

1239
00:52:49,380 --> 00:52:53,140
Also, side note, Griffin, there's no way that's what's bringing back Destiny's Child.

1240
00:52:53,140 --> 00:52:57,300
So just one of them is dead, right?

1241
00:52:58,980 --> 00:53:00,980
No, no, no.

1242
00:53:01,700 --> 00:53:02,660
Oh, Sasha Fierce.

1243
00:53:03,700 --> 00:53:06,340
Sasha Fierce is dead because she has been reborn.

1244
00:53:06,980 --> 00:53:12,340
So thank you so much for coming and enjoying our program again.

1245
00:53:13,300 --> 00:53:16,820
I don't know what continually draws you in.

1246
00:53:17,780 --> 00:53:20,260
It's definitely not a pronunciations of simple words.

1247
00:53:20,260 --> 00:53:22,740
It's like like continually.

1248
00:53:23,380 --> 00:53:26,820
I want to encourage you to follow us on Twitter at MBNBAM.

1249
00:53:26,820 --> 00:53:29,380
Subscribe, rate the show, etc.

1250
00:53:30,580 --> 00:53:33,220
We have a mailing address now.

1251
00:53:33,220 --> 00:53:40,500
It's Justin McElroy or MBNBAM PO Box 54, Huntington, West Virginia 25706.

1252
00:53:41,140 --> 00:53:42,740
I only received one thing this week.

1253
00:53:42,740 --> 00:53:44,100
It's from Paul and Austin.

1254
00:53:45,300 --> 00:53:48,420
There's a note handwritten in what appears to be crayon.

1255
00:53:48,420 --> 00:53:49,220
This is going well.

1256
00:53:49,220 --> 00:53:50,340
Well, yeah.

1257
00:53:50,340 --> 00:53:57,060
It says, please accept this humble offering of 20 fine images of the great Nicholas Cage

1258
00:53:57,060 --> 00:54:00,900
printed on only the finest computer paper money can buy.

1259
00:54:00,900 --> 00:54:03,060
Sincerely, Paul and Austin.

1260
00:54:03,060 --> 00:54:07,460
And when you open the envelope, there are, in fact, 20, I would say,

1261
00:54:08,180 --> 00:54:13,220
stamp size pictures of Nicholas Cage that have been printed out.

1262
00:54:15,060 --> 00:54:17,060
It was a really good thing to get in the mail.

1263
00:54:17,060 --> 00:54:20,820
So that is paying off in dividend, paying dividends.

1264
00:54:20,820 --> 00:54:22,340
Can you send a mail or something?

1265
00:54:22,340 --> 00:54:23,380
Can you forward those to me?

1266
00:54:24,580 --> 00:54:28,980
Yeah, I need them for a completely innocent and healthy purpose.

1267
00:54:31,300 --> 00:54:36,020
You can also tweet about the show with the MBNBAM hashtag.

1268
00:54:38,340 --> 00:54:40,660
Let's see who's been who's been tweeting this week, guys.

1269
00:54:42,260 --> 00:54:43,700
I tweeted some stuff.

1270
00:54:43,700 --> 00:54:44,500
Who tweeted?

1271
00:54:44,500 --> 00:54:45,700
This is our new segment.

1272
00:54:45,700 --> 00:54:46,420
Who tweeted?

1273
00:54:47,140 --> 00:54:50,740
I just went to Twitter.com, which is not what the website's called.

1274
00:54:50,740 --> 00:54:55,380
No, one of them is, of course, Tony award-winning composer Lin Manuel Miranda.

1275
00:54:55,380 --> 00:54:55,940
He's a fan.

1276
00:54:55,940 --> 00:54:57,540
Oh, no, not a big deal at all.

1277
00:54:57,540 --> 00:54:59,140
No big, no big whoop.

1278
00:54:59,140 --> 00:55:00,420
Just enjoys the program.

1279
00:55:01,140 --> 00:55:01,700
No big deal.

1280
00:55:02,580 --> 00:55:08,260
How long before, how long before you think we become his muse and we have the musical

1281
00:55:08,260 --> 00:55:12,740
finally, finally, we, the people demand it.

1282
00:55:12,740 --> 00:55:20,820
Rocky Horror, our own personal favorite DJ, is halfway through MBNBAM Mixtape 3, where

1283
00:55:20,820 --> 00:55:25,380
our thoughts, our feelings, our dreams are mixed with the beats of today.

1284
00:55:25,380 --> 00:55:26,580
So can't wait for that.

1285
00:55:27,300 --> 00:55:28,420
Hope he'll bring the drop.

1286
00:55:29,380 --> 00:55:37,700
Angry Kangaroo, Jeff Hort, Abigail McCauley, BlackStormy129, Substitute, Fat Bob-A-Lot,

1287
00:55:37,700 --> 00:55:41,620
Helen Amazing Love, Actuary, IamFatty,

1288
00:55:41,620 --> 00:55:43,540
IamFeminista.

1289
00:55:43,540 --> 00:55:47,060
Everybody, thank you so much for tweeting about our program.

1290
00:55:47,060 --> 00:55:48,740
It means a lot to us.

1291
00:55:51,060 --> 00:55:53,940
I want to thank John Roderick and the Long Winters for the use of our theme song, It's

1292
00:55:53,940 --> 00:55:56,100
A Departure, off the album Putting the Days to Bed.

1293
00:55:57,380 --> 00:55:59,860
It's a good, you know what it is?

1294
00:55:59,860 --> 00:56:06,180
It reminds me of the classic rock that like I used to listen to when I was a kid, when

1295
00:56:06,180 --> 00:56:07,060
I was coming up.

1296
00:56:07,060 --> 00:56:07,700
You know what I mean?

1297
00:56:07,700 --> 00:56:15,460
Like before, just before all the, all the violence and like very sexual.

1298
00:56:15,460 --> 00:56:20,260
And sometimes there were drugs that like in the song, like it talks about it and the kids

1299
00:56:20,260 --> 00:56:21,700
do them anyway.

1300
00:56:23,380 --> 00:56:23,880
Thanks.

1301
00:56:24,980 --> 00:56:25,480
Thanks.

1302
00:56:26,820 --> 00:56:28,980
And thanks for listening to our podcast.

1303
00:56:28,980 --> 00:56:32,100
Griffin has one more Yahoo answer for us to think about.

1304
00:56:32,100 --> 00:56:35,300
And of course, as always, we'll return to answer it next week.

1305
00:56:35,300 --> 00:56:38,020
But we're just going to ponder it in the days to come.

1306
00:56:40,020 --> 00:56:45,940
This final Yahoo answer was sent in by Nicole Thompson.

1307
00:56:45,940 --> 00:56:46,660
Thank you, Nicole.

1308
00:56:46,660 --> 00:56:50,660
It's by Yahoo Answers user Bunny, who asks, who axes.

1309
00:56:52,820 --> 00:56:55,700
How can I break my wrist fast at home?

1310
00:56:58,580 --> 00:56:59,540
I'm Justin McElroy.

1311
00:56:59,540 --> 00:57:00,420
I'm Travis McElroy.

1312
00:57:00,420 --> 00:57:01,220
I'm Griffin McElroy.

1313
00:57:01,220 --> 00:57:04,900
It's been my brother, my brother and me, kiss your dad.

1314
00:57:04,900 --> 00:57:31,460
And air on the lips.
