1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:30,640
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:48,560
Ladies and gentlemen, here we are, my brother, my brother, and me.

6
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:52,480
We have made a replacement in the lineup, unprecedented.

7
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:55,680
I'm still here. I'm still Justin McElroy, the oldest brother.

8
00:00:55,680 --> 00:01:00,000
I'm here also. I haven't changed. I'm the baby brother, Griffin McElroy.

9
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,240
But I'm new, baby. I'm Fat Pipes McElroy.

10
00:01:04,240 --> 00:01:05,440
Listen to that sound.

11
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:09,760
Listen to the crispness. You can hear every bit and bite, every zero, every one.

12
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:12,960
Travis, I feel your resonance right now.

13
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:16,400
As well you should, Justin. I'm sending it to you through the fattest pipes.

14
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:22,400
The basses are lower. The trebles are treble-er, treble-ier.

15
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:29,600
Travis, you were previously on an internet that I was wondering if you could share the

16
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:30,960
name of that with everybody.

17
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:35,520
The name of that internet was Zoomtown, or as I like to call it, My First Internets.

18
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:43,520
You finally decided to see your grandchildren had told you about email so much.

19
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:50,160
Did the modem that came with Zoomtown look like an old, like, Nicktoons alarm clock?

20
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:52,720
It was actually steam-powered.

21
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:56,160
Okay. Did it look like it was made out of floam?

22
00:01:57,440 --> 00:01:57,840
It did.

23
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:02,000
I wanted to share this with you guys before we got started in the show.

24
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:09,920
I was just dipping in to check out our show notes into my email, and I got an email from

25
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:15,840
Amazon alerting me that they had refunded me as part of a price matching.

26
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:19,920
They had refunded me four cents on a game.

27
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:26,080
And I just want to say, Amazon, if you're listening, you can just keep that in for a

28
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:30,160
minute. Just have those four cents for Amazon.

29
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:33,520
Amazon, you do a lot for us, and you can just have the four cents, Amazon.

30
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:34,800
Just keep it next time.

31
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:40,480
If someone came to me and said, Justin, I'll pay you four cents to read an email, any email,

32
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:42,320
I would tell them to go fuck themselves.

33
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:47,200
And now Amazon has an unwillingly foisted that transaction upon me.

34
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:52,640
Just that they've fucking wasted that computer's precious database.

35
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:56,080
That computer probably doesn't have the bandwidth of Fat Pipe's McElroy.

36
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:57,040
You know what I mean?

37
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:57,840
Who does?

38
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:00,000
Justin, you've actually been offended on the wrong level.

39
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:01,200
Why's that?

40
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:04,880
The correct level to be offended on is that Amazon looked at all of your purchases and

41
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:09,040
said, you know, Justin could probably really use this for something.

42
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:10,080
Why don't they know?

43
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:14,000
Don't they know how much money I spent there that I clearly don't need four cents?

44
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:18,080
I'm ordering my kitty litter from Amazon.

45
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:21,360
I think I can meet them halfway.

46
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:21,920
I get it, though.

47
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:22,960
That box is so heavy.

48
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:24,640
You don't want to carry that around the Kroger's.

49
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:27,360
No, you want to make the poor UPS guy do it.

50
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:29,440
No, I like to see him struggle with it, actually.

51
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:34,240
And then just as he's walking away, I open it and I'm like, my cat shit's in this.

52
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:35,440
Sorry about your back.

53
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:38,080
He's walking up all excited like somebody's getting a special package.

54
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:38,640
Pretty heavy.

55
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:40,080
What is this, some new Bose?

56
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:41,280
Are these some new Bose speakers?

57
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:42,400
Perhaps a home entertainment set?

58
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:44,400
Oh, no, but it's cat poop dirt.

59
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:48,560
Although I experienced that same thing when I'm like, whoa, what did daddy order?

60
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:53,200
I don't remember, must have done some late night whiskey fueled Amazoning.

61
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:53,920
Ah, damn it.

62
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:54,720
How responsible.

63
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:56,400
Happy Daddy's Day, by the way.

64
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:57,680
Happy Daddy's Day.

65
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:00,880
We should have started with that instead of Travis Fat Pies McElroy.

66
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:05,680
That kind of information is brought to me quicker now because of the fat internets that I use.

67
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:06,080
Yeah.

68
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:09,440
Travis, while we were talking, Googled, what day is it?

69
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:11,760
What day is it today?

70
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:12,560
What day am today?

71
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:14,480
Who am today?

72
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:16,880
Happy Daddy's Day to the daddies in there.

73
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:18,480
And of course, to our daddy.

74
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:19,440
Do we have any more fun?

75
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:23,280
Last Daddy's Day, we told the story of when dad cut his butt open and had to use a maxi

76
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:24,640
pad as a makeshift bandage.

77
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:27,200
I don't know that any story is better than that.

78
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:29,680
I think we told the Freebasing kitty litter, too.

79
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:31,840
Yeah, we told the Freebasing kitty litter.

80
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:36,320
We told the story of when he was carrying a tray of lunch meat and got hit by a rear

81
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:39,120
view mirror on the car that was passing by.

82
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:42,960
And then he had to get driven by the hospital by this woman who was praying over the entire

83
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:43,520
drive.

84
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:44,320
Oh, man.

85
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:45,120
I remember that one.

86
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:46,320
A lot of fun.

87
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:49,600
I told the story on Twitter today about the jawbreaker in the theater.

88
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:50,800
You guys know that one.

89
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:51,440
I don't think so.

90
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:56,400
Where we were seeing a play with dad, and our dad used to be obsessed with these...

91
00:04:57,280 --> 00:04:58,880
They were bird's egg jawbreakers.

92
00:04:58,880 --> 00:04:59,600
Bird's egg.

93
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:01,920
Sometimes I call them psychedelic jawbreakers.

94
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:05,040
They're the white ones with the colorful flecks on them.

95
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:10,400
That when you eat them enough, those flecks turn into like...

96
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:11,600
They become tactile.

97
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:13,920
They become like fucking burs.

98
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:18,320
Yeah, it's like a topographical map of the earth.

99
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:20,560
It's the worst thing to have in your mouth.

100
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:23,120
I don't know why he was as obsessed with them as he was.

101
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:27,120
They're why our daddy has diabetes now, but he loved them back in the day.

102
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:28,000
He had a whole...

103
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,280
You could get them at Cracker Barrel.

104
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:30,560
It was like his exclusive dealer.

105
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:36,320
And I remember he had an empty Shed Spread Country Crock container that he kept up out

106
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:37,200
of our reach.

107
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:38,160
Mac, you're back, huh?

108
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:40,800
Wait till you see this new shit I got in.

109
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:44,000
I've got the dopest, prickliest kush.

110
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:48,320
But anyway, so he was enjoying some of his prickly kush.

111
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:57,360
And he laughed, and the jawbreaker pops out of his mouth and rolls down two aisles.

112
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:59,040
And without missing a beat, he says,

113
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:00,160
Ah, my glass eye!

114
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:04,960
And he covers the socket with his hand.

115
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:09,600
And this woman, two aisles down, picks it up and hands it back to him.

116
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:12,560
And he pops it right in his mouth, because he's a dirty creep.

117
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:13,440
Our dad's a dirty creep.

118
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:15,440
Our dad's a creepy, dirty fuck.

119
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:15,920
Just kidding.

120
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:17,600
He's the best dad of all time.

121
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:22,480
If you say anything like that about my dad, I'll take your skin.

122
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:24,320
Take your skin.

123
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:25,120
Then it's ours.

124
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:26,320
Hey, let's help some people.

125
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:28,800
I recently moved to the city, and I've been on a number of dates.

126
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:30,960
And expect to go on many more.

127
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:31,520
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

128
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:32,560
All right, you have it.

129
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:33,060
Okay.

130
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:35,200
Maybe you should be advising us.

131
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:35,920
My problem is this.

132
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:39,440
I have what they say, what they might call a cool wiener.

133
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:46,960
My problem is this.

134
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:50,720
After a first date, I never know how and when to contact the female in question.

135
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:52,880
Is the next day fair play?

136
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:54,880
Should I wait a day or two and call?

137
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:59,200
I've heard many opinions, but I would greatly appreciate the wisdom of the McElroy's.

138
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:00,400
That's from Text in the City.

139
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:04,000
It shouldn't be a problem, right?

140
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,400
Like, the answer is never.

141
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:07,760
You gotta wait for her to call you.

142
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:09,680
And if she doesn't call you, then you didn't do it right.

143
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:11,200
Did you drop enough negs?

144
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:14,240
Did you wax your fedora before you went out?

145
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:17,360
How was your fedora game?

146
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:18,960
These are the important questions.

147
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:20,240
Drop enough negs.

148
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:22,880
Hey, everybody, if you're negging, quit it.

149
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:25,200
Travis, you know this phenomenon, right?

150
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:29,280
Negging is when you say something negative.

151
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:31,120
I was able to infer that, Justin.

152
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:32,400
Thank you, though, for breaking it down.

153
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:36,240
Oh, man, I literally didn't make the connection until this precise podcasting moment.

154
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:37,520
Oh, Jesus, Justin.

155
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:37,760
Really?

156
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:39,840
I had no idea what it stood for.

157
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:42,160
I thought it had something to do with eggs.

158
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:44,240
Okay, so wait, was this one of your leading, like,

159
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:45,760
Travis, you know what this means, right?

160
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:47,840
Because you wanted to find out what it meant.

161
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:50,160
Yeah, I was kind of leading the younger people to help me.

162
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:51,600
I mean, I figured it was like eggs.

163
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:56,800
Like, you plant a seed and you plant it and then it hatches into love.

164
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:58,800
Travis, you know what a vagina is, right?

165
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:01,840
Travis, you've heard of a vagina.

166
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:04,320
What do hugs feel like?

167
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:07,680
This can't be a, this, that's not a science thing, right?

168
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:09,920
Because I don't, if somebody ever came up to me and was like,

169
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:12,560
hey, you have a big head and you're a little bit overweight in your gut area,

170
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:16,000
I wouldn't be like, I'm, let's stick right now.

171
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:16,640
So it's down, right?

172
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:16,960
Gotta have it.

173
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:19,760
Yeah, because you roll up and be like, oh, you wore that shirt tonight, huh?

174
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:20,400
Okay.

175
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:22,880
And like, the girl says to you, like, this is the one.

176
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:23,680
Like, how does that work?

177
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:24,720
Okay, anyways.

178
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:30,080
If anybody, if like, I'm, if anybody is as self-conscious as I am

179
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:34,000
whenever I'm in a social nighttime environment,

180
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:37,360
like anything, like even, even what you said, Travis,

181
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:39,680
if somebody came up to me and said, oh, that's the shirt you're wearing, huh?

182
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:40,400
I would fucking leave.

183
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:41,680
I'd get up and be like, oh, you're right.

184
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:42,480
Bye.

185
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:43,200
Ah, no.

186
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:46,960
Is, is pause in a thing we could get going?

187
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:48,320
Can we get pause in going?

188
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:48,720
What's that?

189
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:49,600
You just, you just,

190
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:50,720
You mean compliments.

191
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:52,160
Like complimenting the person.

192
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:53,200
Complimenting people.

193
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:54,960
That's good, but it's not like hip.

194
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:57,120
I'm not going to sell a book called compliments.

195
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:59,200
I might be able to sell a book called pause in.

196
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:01,200
You could do it if like there was a Z on the end.

197
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:03,840
If it was like compliments with Justin.

198
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:06,480
Is that four Ns?

199
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:07,600
It sounded like four Ns.

200
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:09,360
Anyway, I really want to help this person.

201
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:13,920
I think that, you know, the standard wisdom used to be waiting to call,

202
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:17,120
but I think the nice thing is that with,

203
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:19,440
we have so many different means of communication now

204
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:22,400
that I think you can stair step back up to that.

205
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:24,000
Like I think the next day.

206
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,200
Justin, if I may interrupt.

207
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:28,080
Well, this is a first?

208
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:31,280
This is one step removed from that question

209
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:34,560
because he's already been on a date with this person.

210
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:37,360
This isn't like, I got a girl's number that I met at a bar.

211
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:39,680
When do I call her to schedule a date?

212
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:41,040
They've already gone on a date.

213
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:44,880
There is so much FUD at play here, you guys.

214
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:47,360
Like a fucking extraordinary amount of FUD.

215
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:48,400
Cause you have no,

216
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:50,640
if they don't give you a clear signal at the end of the first date,

217
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:52,960
like I had a good time and we should do this again,

218
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:54,960
who the fuck knows?

219
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:58,640
They might've hated your guts and you don't know it

220
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:02,720
until you send them a single word SMS message,

221
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:05,680
lowercase H, hey, and that's it.

222
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:07,680
And then they have to respond.

223
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:09,360
The ball's in their court at that point.

224
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:10,400
Here's the move.

225
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:13,280
What you do is you order flowers the next day.

226
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:14,320
That's pretty good.

227
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:17,120
You order flowers, they show up at her office

228
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:18,640
cause she's a working woman.

229
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:20,960
You know, she's got her own priorities,

230
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:23,280
but you order flowers, they show up,

231
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:25,440
and on the card it just says, hey.

232
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:26,320
All lowercase.

233
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:27,040
Lowercase.

234
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:29,760
Cause if you use that capital H, it's like saying, hey.

235
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:31,360
And that sounds like something that a cousin

236
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:33,760
would say to another cousin and they ain't gonna fuck.

237
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:39,680
But if you do a lowercase H, it's like, hey.

238
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:41,280
You know what I mean?

239
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:43,280
It's like a heartbeat.

240
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:46,240
What if you changed it to, oh, hey.

241
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:50,720
Oh, like you just, like the flowers just noticed her?

242
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:52,400
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

243
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:54,400
Can you use flowers for negging?

244
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:55,440
Is that possible?

245
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:56,560
Oh, you wore that shirt?

246
00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:00,480
The nose you're using to smell us is a bit off.

247
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:03,920
Flowers need water to live, you fucking idiot.

248
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:05,440
Put water in these, it'll die.

249
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:07,040
Don't you know how flowers hurt?

250
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:08,800
Everybody stop it with the negging.

251
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:09,280
Stop it.

252
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:15,040
So send flowers the next day and then I think that puts the ball,

253
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:20,000
and this is not because it's a super romantic grandiose gesture.

254
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:24,320
It just completely frees you from any sort of pressure

255
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:26,400
as to how the situation will proceed.

256
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:30,880
Because that is a pretty big Hail Mary putting the ball in her court.

257
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:33,760
That's two sports in one metaphor.

258
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:34,800
I'm retiring.

259
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:39,040
You've got to be careful though.

260
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:42,480
Because I understand the, or if you can establish yourself

261
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:46,880
as the impossible romantic with like the fucking,

262
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:50,560
if you can make yourself seem like a Joseph Gordon Levitt

263
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:54,480
without crossing over to like,

264
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:56,880
I only went on fucking one date with this dude

265
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:58,720
and he's sending me flowers, I'm out.

266
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:00,480
This guy's trying to make a suit out of me.

267
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,400
Okay, so good rule of thumb there then is like,

268
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:06,320
the showiness of the flowers is not the important thing.

269
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:11,520
There's got to be a cactus, maybe like one flower.

270
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:14,960
Do you have a succulents vendor nearby that you can-

271
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:17,920
Oh, send her a fruit bouquet.

272
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:20,240
Everybody loves the fruit,

273
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:23,120
where they make them look like little flowers, but it's fruit.

274
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:23,840
Don't do that.

275
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:24,720
I hate that shit.

276
00:12:25,280 --> 00:12:26,480
People do that.

277
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:27,600
They're not giving you a gift.

278
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:28,880
They're giving you a project.

279
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:31,040
Hey, guess what you're doing for the next two days?

280
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:32,560
Did you guess eating fruit?

281
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:33,600
Because that's it.

282
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:34,320
That's what you do anyway.

283
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:36,400
So what about the flowers that are made out of money?

284
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:38,800
You send her a bouquet of money shaped into flowers.

285
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:39,920
There's no way that could go wrong.

286
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:40,640
That'll go well.

287
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:43,360
Yeah, but people love money of all genders.

288
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:45,280
A cookie bouquet?

289
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:48,080
Okay, now you're getting closer.

290
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:49,120
A giant cookie.

291
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:51,360
Send her a giant cookie.

292
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:53,280
Those are appropriate for every occasion.

293
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:53,760
A birthday.

294
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:55,360
Happy birthday, sport.

295
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:56,960
Birthday, holiday.

296
00:12:57,680 --> 00:13:02,240
A bust of her made of cookie, crisp, cereal.

297
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:06,560
Our friend Dwight says that he's gonna buy a giant cookie

298
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:08,320
the day Hulk Hogan dies.

299
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:10,080
So there's why.

300
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:12,720
To celebrate outliving Hulk Hogan?

301
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:13,680
I guess that's it.

302
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:15,440
To celebrate the death of Hulk Hogan,

303
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:17,360
he's gonna buy a giant cookie.

304
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:19,680
There's a little bit of Highlander-esque schadenfreude

305
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:20,640
happening there.

306
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:21,280
Did I say that word right?

307
00:13:21,280 --> 00:13:22,480
He's been saying that for 10 years,

308
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:24,160
and I can't stop thinking about how good.

309
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:26,800
Every day I hope that that man dies

310
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:28,160
just so I can get into that cookie.

311
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:30,320
Because I can't buy one for myself.

312
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:31,840
No, what excuse is there?

313
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:34,800
Can you buy a giant cookie for yourself?

314
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:36,160
If you buy a giant cookie for yourself,

315
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:37,360
what do you write on it?

316
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:37,760
Sorry?

317
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:39,040
Yeah.

318
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:39,840
Oh, here it goes.

319
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:43,680
See, I think calling...

320
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:46,400
I think if you call the day after,

321
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:49,760
you're rid of the problem with every call

322
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:53,600
where it's like you're presuming that you...

323
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:55,760
You're sort of forcing her hand, I think.

324
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:56,080
That's why you gotta send a text.

325
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:58,080
I feel like with like a nice text,

326
00:13:58,080 --> 00:14:00,560
text, you can get a sense of what she thought.

327
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:02,400
If she hasn't given you the feedback,

328
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:03,440
ball is in your court.

329
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:04,560
So you need to tell her like,

330
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:10,480
I had a great time last night, when can we see each other again?

331
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:12,720
But here's the thing, avoid this phrase.

332
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:15,840
I just wanted to, don't do that.

333
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:18,560
Well, no, we've talked about that before,

334
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:19,840
how you shouldn't be like,

335
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:23,440
hey, I know this is weird, like nobody likes that.

336
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:26,000
I just wanted to say, I had a great time last night.

337
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,200
No, be like...

338
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:28,320
Hey, real quick.

339
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:31,200
Hey, let me grab, can I grab your ear for a second?

340
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:31,680
Let me just...

341
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:36,160
So just say, so just like make it a statement of fact.

342
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:37,520
I had a great time last night.

343
00:14:37,520 --> 00:14:38,560
I'd love to see you again.

344
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:41,840
Not like wishy-washy, like, hey, if you're not busy,

345
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:42,960
you know, if you had a good time,

346
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,480
just say like, hey, a lot of fun last night.

347
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:48,400
Would you be interested in doing it again sometime?

348
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:50,320
You sound like a Hollywood power broker.

349
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:53,680
Hey babe, hey, great time, great time syncing up.

350
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:55,440
Great time, when can we sync up again?

351
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:58,480
Good laughs, a lot of good fun.

352
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:02,560
Great time, tag me on Facebook, hashtag great date.

353
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:05,600
What do you think about the play

354
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:07,440
of like trying to nail down the second date

355
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:09,120
before the end of the first date?

356
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:13,120
I was actually gonna suggest, Travis,

357
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:16,480
that what you should do on any first date

358
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:22,720
is try to borrow something, like try to borrow something.

359
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:24,320
It's cold, can I borrow your jacket?

360
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:25,040
It doesn't matter.

361
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:28,960
The way this is gonna fit you, can I just try it on?

362
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:32,320
It sounds like Travis is suggesting you sign like,

363
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:34,880
you walk in the door to the restaurant

364
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:36,240
where you're having your first date,

365
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:38,400
and you say, all right, babe, here's the deal.

366
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:42,640
I'm interested in signing you on a three date contract

367
00:15:42,640 --> 00:15:44,160
with a chance to renew.

368
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:48,560
We'll have full binnies during the duration of the dates,

369
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:55,040
by which I mean my business hog.

370
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:59,360
Remember when we were talking about Coneheads during the date?

371
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:02,480
No, I thought we did, but I would love to borrow that from you

372
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:06,160
if you have that somewhere on Laserdisc or DVD.

373
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:10,080
That's a risk because you have to guarantee

374
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:11,600
it's something on her person,

375
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:13,920
and I don't think this lady is carrying around

376
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:16,080
a Coneheads DVD with her, and if she is,

377
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:19,600
you have got to go, you have got to go right now.

378
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:21,440
Stand up, collect your belongings, and go.

379
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,760
It is kind of a power move, though, to say,

380
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:24,960
can I borrow a Coneheads?

381
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:26,480
And she goes, I don't have Coneheads with me,

382
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:28,640
and you say, well, I'm happy to go back to your house

383
00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:29,360
with you and get it.

384
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:34,400
And then you're just there, making out.

385
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:36,560
You do it, and then the fucking-

386
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:38,560
And then she says, I don't have Coneheads on DVD

387
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:40,800
because no one does, and you say, are you sure?

388
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:42,880
We should double check back at your place.

389
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:43,520
And then the fucking-

390
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:45,600
I'm happy to go to Best Buy and try to see if they have it

391
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:49,120
in the 5.99 bin, and then maybe we can go home and watch it.

392
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:50,480
And then say, nah, it wasn't that great.

393
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:51,760
It's an overnight date.

394
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:54,240
That's what Before Sunrise is about.

395
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:54,560
Yeah, sure.

396
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:56,160
Trying to find a copy of Coneheads.

397
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:57,360
Yeah, in Vienna.

398
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:58,800
It's like, oh, this is in German, too.

399
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:00,320
Keep looking, keep looking, Celine.

400
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:01,360
We'll find it.

401
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:02,480
We'll find it eventually.

402
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:04,960
You guys want Yahoo?

403
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:05,280
Please.

404
00:17:05,840 --> 00:17:07,680
This Yahoo was sent in by Ira Ray.

405
00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:10,080
Ira Ray!

406
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:11,280
Who wants to know?

407
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:13,280
Did you do that with a mouth of food?

408
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:13,520
No.

409
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:14,720
No?

410
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:15,200
Justin.

411
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,280
Thank you, Ira Ray.

412
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:19,520
It's by Yahoo Answers user Michelle, who asks,

413
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:24,880
is it true that all cops have to start off on a bicycle?

414
00:17:26,080 --> 00:17:29,600
My brother told me that all cops have to start off as a bicycle cop.

415
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:31,920
And do new cops have to wear a hat?

416
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:39,040
I love that.

417
00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:43,600
Like your first week on the job, you're just walking around

418
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:46,480
and then someone looks and your supervisor's like,

419
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:48,560
listen, Daniels, you keep it up.

420
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:50,080
You're going to get that Razor scooter.

421
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:51,360
And then I'm just-

422
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:52,080
That's what I'm saying.

423
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:56,240
I think even starting with a bicycle is a little presumptuous.

424
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:56,720
This makes sense.

425
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:58,240
All cops start with Heelys.

426
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:00,160
You can't just fucking walk into the precinct

427
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:02,800
and get your fucking gold watch and your pension day one.

428
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:05,920
You have to walk yourself up to that by busting some perps.

429
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:08,960
If busting don't make you feel good, then you need to turn around

430
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:10,640
and you need to take that Razor scooter

431
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:11,840
and you need to scoot it on home.

432
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:16,080
So you're saying after your first bust, you get Heelys.

433
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:17,440
You start out with Heelys.

434
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:18,720
You start off with Heelys.

435
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:21,680
And then you get soaps and you can do some extreme walking.

436
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:23,520
Congratulations, you busted your first perp.

437
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:25,040
We're going to upgrade you to eight wheels

438
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:26,400
and then you get some rollerblades.

439
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:26,900
Cool.

440
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:30,160
I'm sorry, what are soaps?

441
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:32,800
Soaps are those shoes that had like the slippery bottoms

442
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:35,360
so that you could like grind on paper.

443
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:37,680
On benches and stuff with your shoes.

444
00:18:38,560 --> 00:18:39,440
Yeah, yeah.

445
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:40,560
Nobody has ever done.

446
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:41,120
Nobody's ever.

447
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:42,240
That is what they sold it as.

448
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:44,560
Like you can grind without wheels.

449
00:18:44,560 --> 00:18:46,720
And it's like you can look like a crazy person

450
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:48,240
who doesn't know how stairs work.

451
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:55,040
I think is where does horse mounted cops,

452
00:18:55,040 --> 00:18:55,680
where do they fit in?

453
00:18:55,680 --> 00:18:58,000
Because I think they are like the fucking king supreme.

454
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:02,480
Yeah, that has to be like anyone who gets to touch a horse

455
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:06,960
for a living has to be like the fucking leader of the pack.

456
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:09,280
Well, they basically just made you like modern day,

457
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:10,480
like Wyatt Earp.

458
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:12,160
Like, hey, we're going to put you on a horse.

459
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:15,120
You'll be the most intimidating person ever.

460
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:15,600
Yeah.

461
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:18,000
Because not only can the cop take you out,

462
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
but the horse is also an officer.

463
00:19:21,920 --> 00:19:22,960
That's not a joke.

464
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:25,680
Are you suggesting the horse has to be sworn in?

465
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:27,200
Is that what you're saying?

466
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:29,200
Now this is a great question because he's always

467
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:33,680
going to say nay.

468
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:35,120
The problem is true.

469
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:37,360
And when the horse cop gets sworn in,

470
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:39,280
the horse has to start on a bicycle.

471
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:42,000
It's like a fucking ringling detective.

472
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:45,200
But then at the end of it, you end up with a horse on a horse.

473
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:47,840
And it's the most intimidating fucking thing.

474
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:50,320
That's how you get the infinite leaning tower,

475
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:52,640
the horse stack, the horse stack of justice.

476
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:57,680
And it's just from the people who brought you stack soap.

477
00:19:57,680 --> 00:19:58,800
Stack horse.

478
00:19:58,800 --> 00:20:00,480
If you're listening at home, pretend

479
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:02,240
when we were talking about oaths,

480
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:05,520
that I said they trick them by saying that they

481
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:06,960
are going to give them oaths.

482
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:08,320
Man, I could have just dropped that in.

483
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:10,320
Yeah, well, you can edit it.

484
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:15,360
I think if I were a cop, the cops that I would always

485
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:18,320
be most jealous of is the cops that they send out

486
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:21,920
to kind of like sit next to where they are doing street

487
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:24,720
construction because those cops are always just

488
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:26,720
like in their car on their iPads.

489
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:27,680
Just chilling.

490
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:29,200
I saw one of those cops last night.

491
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:30,240
That exact thought occurred to me.

492
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:32,480
His laptop was turned away from the crowd.

493
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:34,800
And it's like, you know he's streaming Veronica Mars.

494
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:36,400
Like, no question about it.

495
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:39,120
I may have been in a cop car chase yesterday

496
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:42,560
because I was at the airport and I picked up Rachel's car

497
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:44,320
there and I don't know how to drive that thing

498
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:45,760
because it's not my precious Matrix.

499
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:50,000
And it was in long term parking and I got kind of lost.

500
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:53,360
And I tried to go out like one of the service exit gates

501
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:55,600
quite forcefully and it didn't pan out.

502
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:58,000
And then on the other side of the gate, like the cop

503
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,080
turned on his lights and started coming my way.

504
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:04,560
And I turned heels and I drove a little bit quicker.

505
00:21:04,560 --> 00:21:06,000
I drove a little bit quicker and I made it out

506
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,040
of the parking lot OK.

507
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:10,240
But it's troubling that I didn't think I should just

508
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:12,240
sit here and let this cop take me.

509
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:14,880
And like I need an adult and this adult is going

510
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:16,000
to fix things for me.

511
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,640
My instinct was like full blown Grand Theft Auto.

512
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:19,680
You got a wild streak.

513
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:20,480
I like that about you.

514
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:20,880
I do.

515
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:21,760
It was also 2 a.m.

516
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:23,040
And man, I was a sleepy bear.

517
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:26,400
I get I turned into a fucking aggressive driver

518
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:27,760
when I'm a sleepy bear.

519
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:30,160
I think I don't know if there's any truth to this.

520
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:32,640
All the cops I know personally.

521
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:33,840
Here's what's weird about cops.

522
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:34,880
Let me tell you guys about cops.

523
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:36,240
Please do.

524
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:40,000
All the people that I know that turned into cops

525
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:43,440
are like some of the fucking most solid dudes.

526
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:44,880
Right.

527
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:47,840
But the people I don't know that are cops are bad

528
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:48,720
across the board.

529
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:50,960
I've never had a good run in with a cop I didn't know

530
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:54,480
that was like that felt like a good equitable exchange

531
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:56,640
I just had with that municipal officer.

532
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:59,760
It was like, man, that dude's really getting off on it.

533
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:01,360
This is what I want to say.

534
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:04,160
First of all, James Gowdy, you're a cop and you're awesome.

535
00:22:04,160 --> 00:22:04,720
You're doing great.

536
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:05,440
That's what I'm saying.

537
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:08,560
I know him and he's fucking doing the Lord's work over there.

538
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:11,760
This is what I came to realize in pretty much every

539
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:14,000
like service profession like that.

540
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:17,680
I look at, for example, somebody working the counter at an airline

541
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:19,360
and they're always a little bit gruff to me.

542
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:20,800
And I'm like, but I'm a really nice guy.

543
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:22,240
Why are they being gruff to me?

544
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:26,960
And then I think about the 999,999 other people that are

545
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:28,960
dicks to them on a regular basis.

546
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:31,920
Now, take that and multiply it times 100.

547
00:22:31,920 --> 00:22:34,480
And that's what it must be like to be a police officer.

548
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:37,760
When somebody is gruff to a cop, they are high on meth

549
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:39,600
and try and bite them on the face and neck.

550
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:43,040
It's like, excuse me, sir.

551
00:22:43,040 --> 00:22:46,000
You're being kind of rude by trying to chew my fucking face

552
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,520
off because I'm a Florida cop.

553
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:50,320
So the idea of like a cop kind of gives me a mean look

554
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:51,840
and I didn't do anything.

555
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:54,000
I'm like, you know, he's probably earned that.

556
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:56,160
He's probably seen some shit.

557
00:22:56,160 --> 00:23:00,160
I'm such a broken person deep down in my heart that whenever

558
00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:06,800
I get into an altercation with a police officer or anybody

559
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:08,880
with a badge, really, and when I say altercation,

560
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:10,080
I mean like looking at me.

561
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:13,120
I want them to walk away from the experience.

562
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:16,400
The only thing I care about is I want them to walk away

563
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:18,800
from the experience thinking, that isn't all right, dude.

564
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:20,400
You know, we're on different sides.

565
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:22,000
He's reaffirmed my faith in humanity.

566
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:25,520
We're on different sides of the law, but I got,

567
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:31,280
when I was at E3 last week, I had the wrong badge holder

568
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:33,520
for my badge because I was trying to get on the show floor

569
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:36,640
and the security guard was very mean and he took away

570
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:39,760
my badge holder because he said I was using it improperly

571
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:42,480
and he took it back to his office and it literally like,

572
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:44,000
first off, it shattered my day.

573
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:47,520
I was like completely out of it.

574
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:50,160
The next day, I saw him in the security office

575
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:52,800
and the thought occurred to me that I should go in

576
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:55,200
and apologize to try to win him back over.

577
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:56,960
You fucking dummy.

578
00:23:56,960 --> 00:23:59,200
I didn't do it, but that's what I thought.

579
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:01,200
I was like, well, there's this person on earth.

580
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:03,840
I'm sorry I put the paper thing in the wrong plastic thing.

581
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:05,600
You gotta go in there and slam open the door and say,

582
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:08,480
you're a loose cannon, Franklin, even if that's not his name.

583
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:11,120
I was like, I'm sick of you crossing the line.

584
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:13,040
Give me your gun and badge and get out of here.

585
00:24:13,040 --> 00:24:15,680
And he'll be so flustered, but it's exactly what he's always

586
00:24:15,680 --> 00:24:17,280
dreamed of happening that he'll do it.

587
00:24:17,280 --> 00:24:20,000
I get very deferent in situations like this,

588
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:23,440
even for the most minor infraction,

589
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:25,360
which is really all that I can really pull off.

590
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:29,600
Because like in that moment, I'm a perp.

591
00:24:31,920 --> 00:24:34,640
In that moment where like my fucking,

592
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:38,640
my matrix is sitting outside hasn't been inspected annually

593
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:40,640
as Texas does require.

594
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:43,360
It hasn't, it's been expired since like March.

595
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:45,760
And I'm sitting here like with a fucking knot in my tummy

596
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:47,760
because I'm a perp right now, guys.

597
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:49,520
I'm a perp, I did a crime.

598
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:51,920
Well, my car got towed away because my registration

599
00:24:51,920 --> 00:24:53,680
was expired by two years.

600
00:24:53,680 --> 00:24:55,040
Okay, that's pretty bad.

601
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:56,160
I know, I'm a rebel.

602
00:24:57,280 --> 00:24:59,280
You guys don't even have inspections, right?

603
00:24:59,280 --> 00:25:00,880
No, it's not inspection, just registration.

604
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:04,000
I just couldn't be bothered to go down to the courthouse

605
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:04,640
and take care of it.

606
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:07,520
Deuter comes up and he's writing my ticket and I go out

607
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:08,800
and I'm talking to him and I'm like,

608
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:10,320
okay, so I'll get it taken care of.

609
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:11,520
And he's like, yeah, you should do that.

610
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:12,240
It's been two years.

611
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:13,600
And I was like, okay, great, thanks.

612
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:15,440
But then he's back 10 minutes later,

613
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:16,960
having the car towed away.

614
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:17,760
Yeah, oh God.

615
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:21,360
And I was like, I said, please don't tow my car away, sir.

616
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:24,160
He beat off to that so hard that night.

617
00:25:24,160 --> 00:25:28,160
I'm telling you, I'm not saying it's all cops

618
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:29,840
because they're doing a fucking dangerous job.

619
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:32,240
I would never ever do that.

620
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:33,840
But there are some cops that are like,

621
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,080
I know you got here right as your meter expired,

622
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:39,280
but I got to give you this ticket

623
00:25:39,280 --> 00:25:41,520
so I can have something to jerk off to tonight

624
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:44,560
because God knows my wife's not going to do it for me.

625
00:25:44,560 --> 00:25:47,040
I know that's not true because his response was great

626
00:25:47,040 --> 00:25:48,880
when I said, please don't tow my car away.

627
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:52,080
And he said, I mean, I would love to not do that,

628
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:54,480
but it's been two years.

629
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:55,040
Yeah, you were.

630
00:25:55,040 --> 00:25:56,240
I was like, okay, yeah, yeah, yeah.

631
00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:58,400
I've been out at which where I went, yeah, you're right.

632
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:00,320
I just went inside and waited for it to be towed away.

633
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:01,360
Yeah, did you look away?

634
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:02,080
Did you watch it?

635
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:04,080
I couldn't fucking possibly watch.

636
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:04,560
No, I couldn't.

637
00:26:04,560 --> 00:26:06,160
I'm always terrified when someone tows my car.

638
00:26:06,160 --> 00:26:08,480
The perp guilt would like fucking strangle me.

639
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:11,120
Let's help somebody else.

640
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:13,840
I'm a 16 year old girl who had waist length,

641
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:16,400
extremely curly hair until recently

642
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:18,480
when I got five inches cut off.

643
00:26:19,040 --> 00:26:21,280
Even with the new do, I'm not satisfied with my hair.

644
00:26:21,280 --> 00:26:24,720
I want to cut it short in a boyish, not unlike Morrissey cut.

645
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:27,440
I'm going to take a quick time out here and submit that.

646
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:30,160
I think this problem, this person may be asking

647
00:26:30,160 --> 00:26:31,440
the wrong people about this,

648
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:33,440
no matter what the question ends up being,

649
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:35,120
but I'm just going to keep going with it, okay?

650
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:36,560
No, women's style advice.

651
00:26:36,560 --> 00:26:37,920
Yeah, women's style advice, perfect.

652
00:26:37,920 --> 00:26:38,720
You've come to the right place.

653
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:40,080
However, if I do this,

654
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:41,600
I will probably give my parents heart attacks.

655
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:44,000
I do not like the way I look,

656
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,240
and I won't have any serious consequences if I get it cut.

657
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:47,840
On the other hand, I will seriously

658
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:49,440
disappoint my parents and feel guilty.

659
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:50,720
What do I do, brothers?

660
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:53,680
Cut my hair and feel guilty or suffer through the summer heat

661
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:57,200
with my mess of curls as from contemplating on Cape Cod.

662
00:26:57,920 --> 00:27:00,320
Are your parents extremely religious

663
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:02,480
and think like you'll lose your super strength if you get it?

664
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:04,560
Like, what the fuck are your parents' problems?

665
00:27:04,560 --> 00:27:05,680
It's your fucking hair.

666
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:09,840
They lost the right to it when you were a kid.

667
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:12,000
When you emerge from the womb.

668
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:15,520
Now, I don't know your parents contemplating,

669
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:17,920
but it seems to me like if you said,

670
00:27:17,920 --> 00:27:20,960
hey, I'm thinking of cutting most of my hair off,

671
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:22,320
and then when you did it,

672
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:24,160
they probably wouldn't have a heart attack

673
00:27:24,160 --> 00:27:26,720
because they're like, well, she did say it.

674
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:28,080
She did say it was going to happen.

675
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:29,040
She warned us, you know?

676
00:27:29,040 --> 00:27:30,080
She did warn us.

677
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:33,440
Contemplating, I was 16 once, hard as that may be for me.

678
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:35,120
And he had waist-length curly hair.

679
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:36,880
I had beautiful waist, no.

680
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:40,480
So, I was 16 once, and I'm gonna go ahead

681
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:42,960
and let you in on this now.

682
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:46,640
You're gonna be disappointing your parents a lot

683
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:47,680
over the next decade.

684
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:50,240
This seems like a really nice...

685
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:55,520
A slow ramp up to the constant disappointment.

686
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:58,560
Yeah, a nice sort of palette cleanser

687
00:27:58,560 --> 00:28:00,720
for all the disappointment you're gonna be bringing

688
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:01,920
onto them over the next decade.

689
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:03,920
Why not go ahead and start small?

690
00:28:03,920 --> 00:28:05,360
Learn how to deal with it.

691
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:07,520
Start practicing disappointment now

692
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:09,200
with something this inconsequential

693
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:13,040
so you can really ramp up to the drug addiction

694
00:28:13,040 --> 00:28:14,640
and the breaking and entering charges.

695
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:18,080
You could also do the sort of switcheroo

696
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:20,400
where you ask for 100 bucks and they're like, no.

697
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:22,160
And then you say, well, how about five?

698
00:28:22,160 --> 00:28:23,680
You gotta give them the bad

699
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:25,040
and then they won't worry about your hair.

700
00:28:25,040 --> 00:28:28,320
So, maybe you do get super into whippets.

701
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:29,120
And you just do...

702
00:28:30,560 --> 00:28:32,560
Talking to them, you're driving home from church,

703
00:28:32,560 --> 00:28:33,680
like, where do you wanna go today?

704
00:28:33,680 --> 00:28:34,480
Applebee's?

705
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:35,840
Yeah, Applebee's is, oh, hold on.

706
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:39,360
And you do that whippet right in the fucking,

707
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:41,040
right in the back of the grand caravan.

708
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:44,560
And then you're like, oh, Applebee's, yeah, sounds great.

709
00:28:44,560 --> 00:28:45,920
And then they're like, what the fuck?

710
00:28:45,920 --> 00:28:47,360
And then they look back, your hair is short.

711
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:48,480
And they're like, we don't care about the hair.

712
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:49,520
Let's talk about these whippets.

713
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:52,240
Then you quit, you quit your whippet.

714
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:54,400
Then you quit, that's the only whippet you ever do.

715
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:55,920
And then you write a book.

716
00:28:55,920 --> 00:28:58,800
It's gonna feel great, that whippet and the hair.

717
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:02,000
I would also say that if at 16

718
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:03,920
you cut off your waist-length hair,

719
00:29:03,920 --> 00:29:07,440
your hair will never be that long again, ever, ever.

720
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:09,200
Wow, is that true?

721
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:10,240
Well, because you gotta think about it.

722
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:13,040
Like, half an inch a month tops, right?

723
00:29:13,680 --> 00:29:15,600
So if you're growing it down to your waist,

724
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:19,680
that's like two and a half feet, you know, three feet.

725
00:29:21,040 --> 00:29:22,400
Waist-length, though.

726
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:24,320
Oh, I solved it, solved it.

727
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:25,600
Don't worry, guys, I solved it.

728
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:29,760
Cut a quarter inch every day.

729
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:30,080
Uh-huh.

730
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:33,360
Oh, you wanna gaslight your parents.

731
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:36,640
Exactly, you're gaslighting them.

732
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:38,560
They're never gonna, they'll never know.

733
00:29:38,560 --> 00:29:40,960
And also, make your dad's clothes

734
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:42,480
smaller and smaller every day

735
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:45,040
so he thinks that he's growing and your hair is shrinking.

736
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:48,000
I'm trying to focus on your hair,

737
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:51,600
but the collar on my Tommy Hilfiger polo is so tight

738
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:52,880
and I don't know why.

739
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:54,880
Am I getting fat neck in my late years?

740
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:55,760
And if they ask what's up, just be like-

741
00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:57,520
Rotate your mother's living room furniture

742
00:29:57,520 --> 00:29:58,880
one quarter inch a day

743
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:01,680
until eventually the room is southward facing.

744
00:30:01,680 --> 00:30:03,360
If they ask what's up, just say that the universe

745
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:04,720
is constantly expanding.

746
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:06,320
And they'll be like, why does that have,

747
00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:07,920
why isn't my hair getting shorter?

748
00:30:07,920 --> 00:30:09,040
And you'll be like, I guess you're not as,

749
00:30:09,040 --> 00:30:10,480
I guess you're not as keyed in as I am

750
00:30:11,280 --> 00:30:12,880
to the universe's ways.

751
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:13,920
You could also cut off your hair

752
00:30:13,920 --> 00:30:15,920
and then donate it to like Locks of Love or something.

753
00:30:15,920 --> 00:30:17,040
And then when your parents are like,

754
00:30:17,040 --> 00:30:18,160
you cut off all your hair.

755
00:30:18,160 --> 00:30:19,040
And they're like, yeah.

756
00:30:19,040 --> 00:30:20,640
And I gave it to people who needed it more.

757
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:23,200
That's good, Trav, I like that a lot.

758
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:25,120
Why don't you take on an industrial job,

759
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:28,000
like in a factory or a workshop or a workhouse,

760
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,320
and then they're like, hey,

761
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:32,240
contemplate it, why don't you cut your hair?

762
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:33,040
And be like, oh, I don't know,

763
00:30:33,040 --> 00:30:35,120
maybe because I didn't want my fucking head

764
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:38,400
to get pulled into some sort of contraption, mommy.

765
00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:42,400
It's a serious concern.

766
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:43,520
It is a serious concern.

767
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:44,720
That's why Morrissey cut his hair.

768
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:46,080
Morrissey was working in a sweatshop.

769
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:47,520
And that's why his songs-

770
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:49,120
They told him he was making enough money

771
00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:50,000
that he didn't have to,

772
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:51,840
but he just wouldn't listen.

773
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:53,520
I meant like as a kid, that's how he got,

774
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:55,760
that's what most of his sad songs are about.

775
00:30:56,800 --> 00:30:58,400
Sweatshop Blues, for one.

776
00:30:58,400 --> 00:30:59,760
Where'd all my hair go?

777
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:00,560
It's a good one.

778
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:02,000
Moon River.

779
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:08,240
Farm wisdom, farm wisdom,

780
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:11,760
coming straight from the farm, it's farm wisdom.

781
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:15,280
It's farm wisdom, farm wisdom.

782
00:31:15,280 --> 00:31:18,480
Travis McElroy presents Farm Wisdom.

783
00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:22,400
So this next Farm Wisdom comes from Mike Asbury,

784
00:31:23,040 --> 00:31:23,520
who says-

785
00:31:23,520 --> 00:31:26,000
It's not possibly, it's not,

786
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,560
it's not, that's not a hundred percent,

787
00:31:28,560 --> 00:31:30,800
definitely not how his last name is pronounced.

788
00:31:30,800 --> 00:31:31,760
How do you pronounce it?

789
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:32,480
Asbury.

790
00:31:33,280 --> 00:31:34,240
There's a T in there.

791
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:38,560
It's from Mike A, Mike A.

792
00:31:38,560 --> 00:31:40,240
But you said Asbury.

793
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:41,440
I said ass to Barry.

794
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,880
I'm almost certain you said Asbury.

795
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:46,240
Travis, farm wisdom.

796
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:48,480
I don't know if this counts as farm wisdom because-

797
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:51,280
Farm wisdom, Asbury's are delicious and great for you.

798
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:54,480
Because I live in downtown Toronto,

799
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:57,520
but I did grow up in the country and that is where my heart still lives.

800
00:31:57,520 --> 00:31:59,440
I guess these are more garden wisdom.

801
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:03,520
To keep cats from using your garden as a litter box,

802
00:32:03,520 --> 00:32:05,760
put fresh citrus peelings in the soil.

803
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:08,000
Oh God, that's fucking so,

804
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:11,280
we caught Cecil fucking in Rachel's herb garden,

805
00:32:11,280 --> 00:32:14,400
which is arguably the worst kind of garden your cat can poop in,

806
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:16,480
just like hovering over the cilantro.

807
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:18,800
And he had a look on his face like, yep.

808
00:32:18,800 --> 00:32:21,440
This is, he like turned, he turned his body to face,

809
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:23,680
we were having a barbecue and he turned his body to like face

810
00:32:23,680 --> 00:32:26,640
all of our friends who were drinking mojitos with the mint in it.

811
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:27,920
Like, yep.

812
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:29,360
Guess what?

813
00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:29,680
You like-

814
00:32:29,680 --> 00:32:30,480
Get out of my house.

815
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:31,520
You like those mojitos?

816
00:32:31,520 --> 00:32:32,720
You like that crushed mint inside?

817
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:33,840
Guess what else is crushed?

818
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:35,920
My butt on top of this mint.

819
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:38,480
We planted a lot of different herbs this year.

820
00:32:39,280 --> 00:32:42,720
And there, we have a lot of neighborhood cats.

821
00:32:43,280 --> 00:32:46,640
Guess which herb we planted did not pan out so well?

822
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:47,840
Catnip.

823
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:48,240
Weed.

824
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:50,880
Catnip did not go so hot.

825
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:54,000
That one got kind of, it is gone.

826
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:54,880
It's completely-

827
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:55,840
Got a little dicey.

828
00:32:55,840 --> 00:32:57,200
Got a little, yeah.

829
00:32:57,200 --> 00:32:58,080
Here's a similar tip.

830
00:32:58,640 --> 00:33:00,800
Plant some lavender, because when cats eat lavender,

831
00:33:00,800 --> 00:33:02,640
they fucking poop their brains out.

832
00:33:04,560 --> 00:33:08,400
That's more of a punitive measure than a precautionary one,

833
00:33:08,400 --> 00:33:10,800
but it'll fucking give that cat what for.

834
00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:12,400
Of course, it doesn't help much-

835
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:15,200
Plant the lavender and the catnip in the same field.

836
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:19,920
Doesn't help much if your cat exclusively poops in your herb garden,

837
00:33:19,920 --> 00:33:21,040
because then it's just,

838
00:33:21,040 --> 00:33:24,000
you're just changing the consistency of the ruination.

839
00:33:24,560 --> 00:33:27,680
Mike also says that begonias are not only bright and nice to look at,

840
00:33:27,680 --> 00:33:30,240
their petals can be used as a substitute for lemon.

841
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:30,720
All right.

842
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:32,240
Oh, that's a good one.

843
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:33,600
Now, is it?

844
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:34,640
No.

845
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:36,960
I mean, I would have a much-

846
00:33:38,800 --> 00:33:44,720
I don't think there's a high probability of me not having lemon on hand,

847
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:46,560
but do having begonias.

848
00:33:46,560 --> 00:33:49,040
Yeah, that's like, oh baby, it looks like we're out of honey

849
00:33:49,040 --> 00:33:51,200
that we need to make this pie crust.

850
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:51,680
Oh, that's okay.

851
00:33:51,680 --> 00:33:56,560
Why don't you just go out in the garden and get me like 100,000 honeysuckles,

852
00:33:56,560 --> 00:33:58,800
and then we'll just spend four whole days getting this ready.

853
00:33:59,520 --> 00:34:00,160
Perfect.

854
00:34:00,160 --> 00:34:00,480
Perfect.

855
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:01,600
That sounds like a great day to me.

856
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:03,680
Thank you for the farm wisdom.

857
00:34:03,680 --> 00:34:04,480
Thanks.

858
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:19,600
And let's take this newfound wisdom and drive it all the way into the money zone.

859
00:34:19,600 --> 00:34:22,720
This first message is from Margo Bookbinder Millman.

860
00:34:22,720 --> 00:34:23,120
Nope.

861
00:34:23,120 --> 00:34:25,440
I want, I just want to jump in real quick and say,

862
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:29,280
I want Bookbinder to be like her professional wrestling.

863
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:31,280
Like that's her title.

864
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:34,320
Like Margo, the Bookbinder, Millman.

865
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:36,000
This is clearly a pen name, right?

866
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:37,520
This is obviously an essayist.

867
00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:41,840
Yeah, short personal essays about her life in Williamsburg

868
00:34:42,640 --> 00:34:45,760
and all the friends she's made, trials and tribulations.

869
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:46,800
I look forward to reading it.

870
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:54,160
Those friends include Lauren, Saia, Steph, Lynn, and Julie.

871
00:34:54,160 --> 00:34:57,360
So it's like, you think it's like Lauren-

872
00:34:57,360 --> 00:34:58,480
Which one is the-

873
00:34:58,480 --> 00:35:03,360
Lauren Wolfheart and Saia Pipesmoke.

874
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:04,800
Okay.

875
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:07,920
Happy birthday to our gorgeous, brilliant friend.

876
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:10,800
We hope you and Dave have the most raucous celebration ever

877
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:13,200
since it's your last one without kids.

878
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:15,600
You should party so hard that your growing baby girl wonders

879
00:35:15,600 --> 00:35:17,360
what the fuck is going on out there.

880
00:35:17,360 --> 00:35:20,160
Fireworks, strippers, dry ice, rinse a tiger.

881
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:22,800
On the other hand, maybe just a massage and a walk on the beach.

882
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:24,960
Can we keep the swearing just to like-

883
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:26,720
Just to a minimum around the maybe?

884
00:35:26,720 --> 00:35:29,120
As little as you possibly can in these messages.

885
00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:31,360
Hey, let us talk to your baby, Margot.

886
00:35:31,360 --> 00:35:32,080
Hey, Margot baby.

887
00:35:32,080 --> 00:35:33,360
Put your headphones on your baby.

888
00:35:33,360 --> 00:35:34,800
Hey, little bookbinder.

889
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:36,640
Hi, bookbinder junior.

890
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:37,600
Hey, little bundle.

891
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:39,600
Have you been to maxfunstore.com?

892
00:35:39,600 --> 00:35:41,040
You can buy t-shirts.

893
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:43,280
When you grow up, that's all you'll want to do.

894
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:44,880
You will buy t-shirts.

895
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:46,800
I think there's also maybe a couple tote bags left

896
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:48,560
you could carry that baby around in.

897
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:49,200
Buy a tote.

898
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:50,560
We're talking to the baby right now.

899
00:35:50,560 --> 00:35:52,160
Put yourself in a bag.

900
00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:52,960
Put yourself in a bag.

901
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:55,200
Hey, baby, put yourself in a bag with our faces on it, baby.

902
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:56,960
Wouldn't it be nice if you could fill it with cotton swabs

903
00:35:56,960 --> 00:35:58,720
and just chill and be so comfortable

904
00:35:58,720 --> 00:36:00,960
and then eat them all and die, probably?

905
00:36:02,080 --> 00:36:03,680
Margot Bookbinder Millman, happy birthday to you.

906
00:36:03,680 --> 00:36:04,400
Happy birthday.

907
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:07,360
Will and Allison Lewis, we got a message for you

908
00:36:07,360 --> 00:36:08,400
from Alex Swager.

909
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:09,760
Travis, what do they have to say?

910
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:11,200
Congrats to an amazing couple.

911
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:14,080
They were married on June 1st and are both listeners.

912
00:36:14,080 --> 00:36:15,920
Will drove out to visit me in Cincinnati

913
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:17,760
to go see Travis perform in Complete Works.

914
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:18,880
Oh, thank you.

915
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:21,120
I'm sure the blessing of their favorite trio of brothers

916
00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:23,360
would go a long way in helping them celebrate their love.

917
00:36:23,360 --> 00:36:24,160
Okay, brace your ass.

918
00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:26,160
Here it comes.

919
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:28,640
You are blessed.

920
00:36:31,040 --> 00:36:32,560
That one got hung up like a sneeze.

921
00:36:32,560 --> 00:36:33,600
I thought it wasn't gonna-

922
00:36:33,600 --> 00:36:34,960
God bless you.

923
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:36,400
It wasn't gonna come out, but then it did.

924
00:36:37,040 --> 00:36:38,960
Congratulations, Will and Allison.

925
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:41,440
You got many happy years coming down the pipe.

926
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:43,280
Maybe like-

927
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:45,200
Do you take her last name or does she take yours?

928
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:46,720
Are you a chauvinist or are you awesome?

929
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:48,260
What?

930
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:51,600
In this day and age, I think it's better for the man

931
00:36:51,600 --> 00:36:52,880
to take the woman's last name.

932
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:54,720
Why are you all about building walls for people?

933
00:36:54,720 --> 00:36:58,560
I know, Travis, it's not about separating the genders

934
00:36:58,560 --> 00:37:02,640
more than we already have with the whole structure of it all,

935
00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:04,880
like the bureaucracy of just like business and government.

936
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:07,920
We've like fucking driven the biggest wedge between them.

937
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:09,760
And I think that that's like the biggest crime

938
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:11,360
that we've done against like America.

939
00:37:11,360 --> 00:37:14,000
Actually, if you want to drive the biggest wedge

940
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:17,520
between the genders, you can find that at extremerestraints.com.

941
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:19,520
They probably do have some sex wedges up in there.

942
00:37:19,520 --> 00:37:21,360
They got sex wedges, that's no problem.

943
00:37:21,360 --> 00:37:23,200
If you're looking to reconnect with your partner,

944
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:25,120
how about a double-ended dildo?

945
00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:28,400
And you can put one in your butt and one in her pussy

946
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:29,760
and then you can fuck each other.

947
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:30,800
Oh God, Justin.

948
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:32,080
No, that's Griffin.

949
00:37:32,080 --> 00:37:34,560
No, but you got to ramp up to that.

950
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:36,320
Like maybe you stay like puss first

951
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:38,720
and then like you get, you can add that.

952
00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:42,000
They have a sex ramp if you want to ramp up to it.

953
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,320
Build some momentum, you mean.

954
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:44,720
It's good.

955
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:47,280
Go to the top and you can jump on it with your sex skateboard.

956
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:47,780
Right.

957
00:37:48,640 --> 00:37:50,720
Just make sure you have Sex Bart Simpson there

958
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:52,640
to tell you how to do all the sweet tricks.

959
00:37:52,640 --> 00:37:53,920
Sex bodacious, man.

960
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:55,440
Sexabunga.

961
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:04,320
Don't have a cow in the bedroom.

962
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:07,680
Extremerestraints.com is your adult superstore.

963
00:38:07,680 --> 00:38:12,720
Super discreet, super sexual, very erotic.

964
00:38:12,720 --> 00:38:15,200
I just got my, as for being a max fun donor,

965
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:17,600
because that's how I roll,

966
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:20,880
I got my intimate sensations pack in the mail,

967
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:24,800
a sex blindfold, a bottle of rocket lube

968
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:27,360
and a personal massager.

969
00:38:27,360 --> 00:38:28,400
I don't know I have any muscles.

970
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:30,080
And a pair of sex headphones.

971
00:38:30,080 --> 00:38:33,200
That are the size of this vibrator.

972
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:34,720
You put the lube in your ear

973
00:38:34,720 --> 00:38:36,720
and you can really get those sex headphones in there.

974
00:38:37,600 --> 00:38:38,880
Oh man, they fit great.

975
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:39,680
They fit so good.

976
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:42,400
And when you're at Extremerestraints.com,

977
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:44,880
you'll see prices,

978
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:47,520
but those are, for my brother, my brother and me, Finn,

979
00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:49,200
those are a mere suggestion.

980
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:51,120
They don't apply to you

981
00:38:51,120 --> 00:38:52,320
because you're gonna save 20%

982
00:38:53,120 --> 00:38:55,360
with our hot new coupon code, Sexabunga.

983
00:38:55,360 --> 00:38:58,000
Swordfish has been fucking compromised.

984
00:38:59,120 --> 00:39:00,560
Swordfish is compromised.

985
00:39:01,360 --> 00:39:03,040
Can we go with Sexabunga?

986
00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:03,760
Is that possible?

987
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:05,760
We gotta establish a spelling right now.

988
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:06,800
How do you think it's spelled?

989
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:08,880
I mean, I think it's pretty,

990
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:11,280
if we all agree on how we think Sexabunga is spelled,

991
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:12,960
I think it should be fairly clear.

992
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:16,160
S-E-X-A-B-U-N-G-A, right?

993
00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:16,800
Okay, Sexabunga.

994
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:17,520
Sexabunga.

995
00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:18,240
Sexabunga.

996
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:21,840
Sexabunga is the new coupon code.

997
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:23,440
It's what Sexparts says.

998
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:24,480
Now listen, listen to me.

999
00:39:26,080 --> 00:39:27,440
This is a fucking good one.

1000
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:30,080
Whoever leaked Swordfish, thank you.

1001
00:39:30,080 --> 00:39:31,360
It was not our best work.

1002
00:39:31,360 --> 00:39:32,800
No, don't say thank you.

1003
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:34,560
No, thank you to whoever leaked Swordfish.

1004
00:39:34,560 --> 00:39:35,760
It was not our best work.

1005
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:36,960
It was not a good,

1006
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:39,520
because we want people to type it in and feel silly

1007
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:41,040
because it's like, oh, this is like a fun word.

1008
00:39:41,040 --> 00:39:42,800
And then they think of us like,

1009
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:45,280
fondly, and then they, you know,

1010
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:46,560
shove something in their butt.

1011
00:39:46,560 --> 00:39:47,760
And they think of us fondly.

1012
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:48,320
I like that.

1013
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:49,040
I like that.

1014
00:39:49,040 --> 00:39:50,400
When they put in Swordfish, they're like,

1015
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:51,760
where did I hear this code again?

1016
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:53,040
God, that was a great movie.

1017
00:39:53,040 --> 00:39:54,320
And then they've forgotten all about us

1018
00:39:54,320 --> 00:39:55,360
when they shove it in their butt.

1019
00:39:56,720 --> 00:39:59,920
They think about Halle Berry's groundbreaking nude scene.

1020
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:00,560
They don't think about us.

1021
00:40:00,560 --> 00:40:02,160
So don't tell anybody about it,

1022
00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:04,160
but do go to extremistrace.com

1023
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:07,600
and, you know,

1024
00:40:07,600 --> 00:40:09,680
buy yourself some adult supplies

1025
00:40:09,680 --> 00:40:11,120
that you need for adult life.

1026
00:40:11,120 --> 00:40:12,160
Mm-hmm.

1027
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:13,760
And enjoy yourself.

1028
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:14,960
Sexabunga, save 20%.

1029
00:40:14,960 --> 00:40:44,400
You've earned it.

1030
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:45,200
I'm ready.

1031
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:47,040
This one was sent in by Ira Ray.

1032
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:48,560
Thank you, Ira Ray.

1033
00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:49,760
It's by Yahoo!

1034
00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:51,600
Answer's user, haha, who asks,

1035
00:40:53,680 --> 00:40:57,680
when twerking, do boys ever talk or say anything?

1036
00:40:59,200 --> 00:41:02,240
When twerking on a boy, do they say anything

1037
00:41:02,240 --> 00:41:03,840
or are they just silent?

1038
00:41:03,840 --> 00:41:05,120
Do they even make a sound?

1039
00:41:06,160 --> 00:41:07,440
This is from four.

1040
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:08,640
This is such a zen question.

1041
00:41:08,640 --> 00:41:10,800
This is from four fucking years ago.

1042
00:41:11,360 --> 00:41:14,080
If a girl twerks in the forest and no one's around,

1043
00:41:14,080 --> 00:41:15,520
does the guy make a sound?

1044
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:16,320
No, because the guy's-

1045
00:41:16,320 --> 00:41:18,080
What is the sound of one hand twerking?

1046
00:41:20,560 --> 00:41:21,760
Stop it.

1047
00:41:21,760 --> 00:41:22,320
Oh, God.

1048
00:41:22,320 --> 00:41:23,040
We don't need it.

1049
00:41:23,040 --> 00:41:23,840
Oh, God.

1050
00:41:23,840 --> 00:41:24,560
It's terrible.

1051
00:41:24,560 --> 00:41:25,200
Don't need it.

1052
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:30,000
Can God create a butt so big even he can't twerk it?

1053
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:37,280
You know, people always ask this,

1054
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:38,800
why do you guys have Travis on the show?

1055
00:41:39,680 --> 00:41:42,080
And is it for moments exactly like this?

1056
00:41:42,080 --> 00:41:43,920
His theology is like on point.

1057
00:41:46,480 --> 00:41:48,880
This question is from four goddamn years ago.

1058
00:41:48,880 --> 00:41:52,400
I did not know that twerking happened in 2009.

1059
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:55,520
I thought that twerking was an invention of a modern era.

1060
00:41:56,080 --> 00:41:58,480
In 2009, no longer counts as the modern era.

1061
00:41:59,200 --> 00:42:01,200
That's the speed at which we're working.

1062
00:42:01,200 --> 00:42:02,400
I know, and twerking.

1063
00:42:05,200 --> 00:42:07,360
It feels like time is moving by a little bit faster.

1064
00:42:07,360 --> 00:42:12,240
Do you think all the twerking is like sped up the rotation

1065
00:42:12,240 --> 00:42:14,480
of our Earth, of the planet?

1066
00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:15,360
Think about it.

1067
00:42:15,360 --> 00:42:16,880
That seems unlikely.

1068
00:42:16,880 --> 00:42:17,280
I'm just saying.

1069
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:19,120
It's more likely it's causing global warming

1070
00:42:19,120 --> 00:42:21,920
because the force of it's pushing us out of rotation.

1071
00:42:21,920 --> 00:42:22,560
I guess it makes sense.

1072
00:42:22,560 --> 00:42:24,160
When people say, God, that twerking's hot.

1073
00:42:24,160 --> 00:42:25,680
That's some hot twerking.

1074
00:42:25,680 --> 00:42:27,920
And then it's like, the sun's like, ugh.

1075
00:42:28,480 --> 00:42:30,640
Now, is that something that's said during the twerking

1076
00:42:30,640 --> 00:42:32,560
or is that said by an outside observer?

1077
00:42:33,920 --> 00:42:35,680
Like observing the twerking.

1078
00:42:35,680 --> 00:42:38,160
Observing the twerk is the only thing that makes it twerking.

1079
00:42:38,160 --> 00:42:39,840
Otherwise, you're just having a butt seizure.

1080
00:42:39,840 --> 00:42:42,640
But if someone sees you twerking, then it's like, oh,

1081
00:42:42,640 --> 00:42:43,440
now it's a twerk.

1082
00:42:46,480 --> 00:42:47,120
One Yahoo!

1083
00:42:47,120 --> 00:42:50,160
Answer respondent said, well, I would love to help you,

1084
00:42:50,160 --> 00:42:52,080
but I don't understand the question you're asking.

1085
00:42:54,720 --> 00:42:56,160
Somebody else said they had to Google it.

1086
00:42:56,160 --> 00:42:58,400
It's like, guys, it's fucking 2013 now.

1087
00:42:58,400 --> 00:43:00,000
Everybody knows what this is.

1088
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:01,200
Read a fucking book.

1089
00:43:01,200 --> 00:43:02,800
Although I guess in 2009, that's what I'm saying.

1090
00:43:02,800 --> 00:43:04,560
This person was on the fucking cutting.

1091
00:43:04,560 --> 00:43:06,000
The butting edge.

1092
00:43:09,520 --> 00:43:10,020
No.

1093
00:43:11,120 --> 00:43:11,520
No.

1094
00:43:11,520 --> 00:43:13,760
There's nothing you can say when that's happening to you.

1095
00:43:13,760 --> 00:43:15,280
You can't be like, oh, this is great.

1096
00:43:16,400 --> 00:43:17,040
Oh, yeah.

1097
00:43:17,040 --> 00:43:18,080
This is fantastic.

1098
00:43:18,080 --> 00:43:18,960
Two thumbs up.

1099
00:43:20,080 --> 00:43:21,040
Sexabunga.

1100
00:43:21,040 --> 00:43:22,240
Sexabunga.

1101
00:43:22,240 --> 00:43:22,960
Yahoo!

1102
00:43:22,960 --> 00:43:26,880
The better question is, does any guy while dancing with any

1103
00:43:26,880 --> 00:43:28,640
girl ever say anything?

1104
00:43:28,640 --> 00:43:29,040
No.

1105
00:43:29,040 --> 00:43:32,800
Especially not when you're talking about back to front dancing.

1106
00:43:32,800 --> 00:43:34,080
There's nothing you can say.

1107
00:43:34,080 --> 00:43:34,560
Yeah.

1108
00:43:34,560 --> 00:43:35,600
What if you did, though?

1109
00:43:35,600 --> 00:43:36,480
What if you could find it?

1110
00:43:36,480 --> 00:43:37,680
What if you could thread that needle?

1111
00:43:37,680 --> 00:43:39,040
Let me get let me hit you guys with this.

1112
00:43:39,920 --> 00:43:40,420
Okay.

1113
00:43:44,800 --> 00:43:47,440
Like you're on like a like you're on a Ferris wheel or something.

1114
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:50,240
Ferris wheels don't usually listen to that reaction actually.

1115
00:43:51,280 --> 00:43:53,120
Who's the loser now, dad?

1116
00:43:53,120 --> 00:43:55,120
Yeah, that's that's fine.

1117
00:43:55,120 --> 00:44:00,240
Can you say like, can you make a banal observation such as this my jam?

1118
00:44:00,240 --> 00:44:04,560
When a new when a new jam starts, can you just announce this my jam?

1119
00:44:04,560 --> 00:44:07,920
Yeah, but you have to be careful because if you get too automated with that, like fucking

1120
00:44:07,920 --> 00:44:10,160
Betty Davis eyes will come on and be like, oh, here it goes.

1121
00:44:10,160 --> 00:44:11,120
This is my jam.

1122
00:44:11,120 --> 00:44:11,680
Keep don't.

1123
00:44:11,680 --> 00:44:13,440
Who's twerking to Betty Davis?

1124
00:44:13,440 --> 00:44:14,320
Me every day.

1125
00:44:17,120 --> 00:44:21,360
Man, if there is a better way to get fired as a DJ, I do not know.

1126
00:44:21,360 --> 00:44:22,720
I got another one for you guys.

1127
00:44:23,760 --> 00:44:25,440
There is yellow gold.

1128
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:26,880
Got this.

1129
00:44:26,880 --> 00:44:28,320
My jam step.

1130
00:44:28,320 --> 00:44:29,040
Fuck yeah.

1131
00:44:29,040 --> 00:44:31,600
Yeah, spin it again, DJ.

1132
00:44:31,600 --> 00:44:33,520
Put Betty Davis on the ones and twos.

1133
00:44:34,320 --> 00:44:36,160
It'd need to be more ironic DJs.

1134
00:44:37,360 --> 00:44:42,400
I think there are probably a shit ton of ironic DJs.

1135
00:44:42,400 --> 00:44:43,360
Probably a lot.

1136
00:44:43,360 --> 00:44:44,640
Probably quite a few.

1137
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:48,800
Like Tiesto, like that.

1138
00:44:48,800 --> 00:44:49,680
Tiesto.

1139
00:44:49,680 --> 00:44:51,440
I'm only into Kim Carnes.

1140
00:44:53,040 --> 00:44:54,960
That's who I'm ironic Tiesto.

1141
00:44:54,960 --> 00:44:58,000
I don't think, I think you probably just don't say anything.

1142
00:44:58,000 --> 00:44:59,280
I don't, I don't do much but-

1143
00:44:59,280 --> 00:45:00,320
You just say thank you.

1144
00:45:01,040 --> 00:45:01,760
I guess.

1145
00:45:02,960 --> 00:45:04,320
I appreciate your hard work.

1146
00:45:05,040 --> 00:45:09,680
I like when I, when we used to go to the fucking gym factory for late nights at the gym factory,

1147
00:45:10,320 --> 00:45:13,120
I used to say like, sorry for my like shitty boner.

1148
00:45:13,120 --> 00:45:18,000
Like sorry I'm fucking 12 and I don't know how, I don't know what I'm doing.

1149
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:23,280
Sorry I'm so like completely out of my depth and fucking terrified and God, it smells awful in here.

1150
00:45:23,280 --> 00:45:27,920
Thank you for allowing me to stand behind you as though I were also dancing.

1151
00:45:27,920 --> 00:45:28,320
Yes.

1152
00:45:28,320 --> 00:45:33,840
If the, if the, man, if you put all those hard, you know, you pay for the classes,

1153
00:45:34,560 --> 00:45:39,520
you do the strengthening exercises and finally you work yourself up to a solid twerk

1154
00:45:40,080 --> 00:45:47,120
and the guy does not appreciate that in some manner, vocally, bonerly,

1155
00:45:47,120 --> 00:45:50,960
like any, any sort of appreciation for the twerk I think is going to be appreciated.

1156
00:45:50,960 --> 00:45:51,520
So you think like-

1157
00:45:51,520 --> 00:45:52,400
It's going to be a welcome-

1158
00:45:52,400 --> 00:45:56,960
You think the gentleman could be like masterful, bravissimo.

1159
00:45:57,760 --> 00:46:02,720
Congratulations, encore, author, author, author.

1160
00:46:02,720 --> 00:46:03,280
It's as though-

1161
00:46:03,280 --> 00:46:04,560
Who is the author of this twerk?

1162
00:46:04,560 --> 00:46:08,320
It's as though your butt cheeks are moving independent from one another.

1163
00:46:08,320 --> 00:46:09,920
I've never seen anything like it.

1164
00:46:11,120 --> 00:46:14,240
You have the jiggling of a young Judy Garland twerking.

1165
00:46:14,880 --> 00:46:18,880
Don't ever, you just ruined, you ruined everything.

1166
00:46:18,880 --> 00:46:22,240
You ruined everything.

1167
00:46:23,680 --> 00:46:25,200
Man, you done fucked up just now.

1168
00:46:26,240 --> 00:46:32,880
Griffin and I spent this week in a hotel room at the Essex Manor and Suites,

1169
00:46:32,880 --> 00:46:35,680
which if you have not stayed in it, don't.

1170
00:46:35,680 --> 00:46:36,480
Don't ever.

1171
00:46:36,480 --> 00:46:37,680
But don't.

1172
00:46:38,400 --> 00:46:47,040
It's an, it's, it's amazing because every room is themed to like an old Hollywood sort of,

1173
00:46:47,040 --> 00:46:49,920
sort of celeb, so there's a WC Fields room.

1174
00:46:49,920 --> 00:46:50,240
Cool.

1175
00:46:50,240 --> 00:46:54,000
Last year we were treated to the Desi Arnaz and Lucille Ball suite.

1176
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:55,360
Perfect, that's what I love.

1177
00:46:56,080 --> 00:46:59,040
This year we were in the Judy Garland suite.

1178
00:47:00,480 --> 00:47:08,080
Let's just say the super creepy hotel attendant put a little extra TLC on the Judy Garland room,

1179
00:47:08,080 --> 00:47:08,800
I think.

1180
00:47:08,800 --> 00:47:12,560
I went into some of the other rooms, not nearly as much memorabilia,

1181
00:47:12,560 --> 00:47:15,280
not nearly as much, you know, like memorable snapshots.

1182
00:47:15,280 --> 00:47:20,000
Uh, this has every, this really covers her entire career.

1183
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:25,200
You cannot see, there is not an angle, there's not a vantage point in this room

1184
00:47:25,200 --> 00:47:28,800
that you can open your eyes and not see at least three Judys.

1185
00:47:28,800 --> 00:47:31,360
There's three Judys per eye look.

1186
00:47:31,360 --> 00:47:34,880
And I think the best thing about the room is it really captured that one moment

1187
00:47:34,880 --> 00:47:40,800
where Judy Garland was murdered in a hotel room because Jesus fuck, it was the creepiest.

1188
00:47:40,800 --> 00:47:42,480
It really summed up that vibe.

1189
00:47:42,480 --> 00:47:44,320
So Essex Manor and Suites, don't miss it.

1190
00:47:44,320 --> 00:47:44,800
Don't miss it.

1191
00:47:44,800 --> 00:47:48,080
They call it on their website, furnished studio apartments.

1192
00:47:48,080 --> 00:47:49,680
Don't let that fool you.

1193
00:47:49,680 --> 00:47:52,080
These are apartments furnished by a mad man.

1194
00:47:54,080 --> 00:47:56,000
A mad elderly gay man.

1195
00:47:56,720 --> 00:47:59,040
Um, how about a question?

1196
00:47:59,040 --> 00:47:59,680
A regular one.

1197
00:48:00,480 --> 00:48:01,200
Fantastic.

1198
00:48:01,920 --> 00:48:04,080
From time to time I babysit my niece.

1199
00:48:04,080 --> 00:48:08,640
She is beautiful and smart and five years old.

1200
00:48:08,640 --> 00:48:12,320
The only problem is that she really likes to show toddlers and Tiaras.

1201
00:48:12,320 --> 00:48:13,840
Oh no.

1202
00:48:13,840 --> 00:48:16,000
I believe it's toddlers and Tiaras.

1203
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:18,480
Although toddlers and Tiaras works just as well.

1204
00:48:18,480 --> 00:48:20,480
It could also be toddlers and Tiaras.

1205
00:48:21,520 --> 00:48:22,800
Tiaras or Tiaras.

1206
00:48:23,520 --> 00:48:27,440
She knows toddlers, but Tiaras.

1207
00:48:28,080 --> 00:48:31,760
She knows all the contestants names and really wants to be one of them.

1208
00:48:33,280 --> 00:48:34,720
What can I do brothers?

1209
00:48:34,720 --> 00:48:39,760
I'm merely her uncle, but I feel as if I should keep the show from molding her young mind.

1210
00:48:39,760 --> 00:48:41,840
Or should I leave it alone?

1211
00:48:43,120 --> 00:48:43,760
Okay.

1212
00:48:43,760 --> 00:48:44,960
That's enough from Oklahoma.

1213
00:48:44,960 --> 00:48:46,080
Oh, what you should do.

1214
00:48:46,080 --> 00:48:49,040
You should support her and shape her into a winner.

1215
00:48:49,040 --> 00:48:51,920
Oh, get that kid and get out of here.

1216
00:48:51,920 --> 00:48:53,600
Does she have a complete package?

1217
00:48:53,600 --> 00:48:54,400
Perfect then.

1218
00:48:54,400 --> 00:48:56,240
Does she have the personality?

1219
00:48:56,240 --> 00:48:57,600
Do you need to get her a flipper?

1220
00:48:57,600 --> 00:49:01,120
Do you need to get her some kind of hair piece to really give her the volume that the judges

1221
00:49:01,120 --> 00:49:01,680
are looking for?

1222
00:49:02,400 --> 00:49:03,440
What's her talent?

1223
00:49:03,440 --> 00:49:04,720
Don't do the terrible thing.

1224
00:49:04,720 --> 00:49:06,240
What kind of costumes are you doing?

1225
00:49:06,240 --> 00:49:09,360
Can you do like a number with you and her and do kind of a dance thing?

1226
00:49:09,360 --> 00:49:10,160
Cause the judges love that.

1227
00:49:10,160 --> 00:49:10,880
Oh, here's a fun number.

1228
00:49:10,880 --> 00:49:11,600
Here's a fun number.

1229
00:49:12,320 --> 00:49:16,160
The fun number is you take the kid and you get in the car and you fucking raising Arizona

1230
00:49:16,160 --> 00:49:17,360
it and you get the fuck out of there.

1231
00:49:17,360 --> 00:49:19,760
And then you and her live on the grid for the next 10 years.

1232
00:49:19,760 --> 00:49:23,520
You know, you might have to pay a little bit extra to get a coach, but really you'll see

1233
00:49:23,520 --> 00:49:24,160
it pay off.

1234
00:49:24,160 --> 00:49:27,760
You are this little broad's last shot at a normal fucking life.

1235
00:49:27,760 --> 00:49:30,400
If you can get her out, if you can extricate her.

1236
00:49:30,400 --> 00:49:34,160
You are this little broad's last shot at a great base tan.

1237
00:49:34,160 --> 00:49:35,200
No follow up.

1238
00:49:36,160 --> 00:49:38,800
Listen, when you spray tan, she's going to giggle, right?

1239
00:49:38,800 --> 00:49:42,160
But you tell her that winners don't giggle and you tell her to focus on my God.

1240
00:49:42,160 --> 00:49:44,240
You run her routine four to five times a week.

1241
00:49:44,240 --> 00:49:47,680
You might have to build a little stage just for her to have a better level.

1242
00:49:47,680 --> 00:49:52,480
She would have maybe set up a judges table and get you and like maybe like if she has

1243
00:49:52,480 --> 00:49:56,080
any brothers or sisters to really judge her and give her notes and let her know there

1244
00:49:56,080 --> 00:49:56,800
will be judgment.

1245
00:49:56,800 --> 00:49:57,920
You're right, Travis.

1246
00:49:57,920 --> 00:50:03,040
You need to take this little broad to the fucking to the fucking rail yard, throw her

1247
00:50:03,040 --> 00:50:07,600
into a box car and just say this is your life now because this is this is this is the life

1248
00:50:07,600 --> 00:50:08,640
that I have chosen for you.

1249
00:50:08,640 --> 00:50:11,920
I know it's not ideal, but it's way better than that other bullshit.

1250
00:50:11,920 --> 00:50:15,040
And listen, the dress is going to cost you like fifteen hundred dollars and the prize

1251
00:50:15,040 --> 00:50:16,480
money is probably only like five hundred.

1252
00:50:16,480 --> 00:50:18,000
So you're not doing it for the money.

1253
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:20,720
You're doing it for her because this is her dream.

1254
00:50:20,720 --> 00:50:21,760
Her dream to be a winner.

1255
00:50:21,760 --> 00:50:22,880
You want the confidence.

1256
00:50:22,880 --> 00:50:23,520
I love that.

1257
00:50:23,520 --> 00:50:29,840
I love that idea where you're her parents say to you, hey, you took Skylar for ice cream

1258
00:50:29,840 --> 00:50:31,920
and we haven't seen her for a few days.

1259
00:50:31,920 --> 00:50:32,880
Do you know what happened?

1260
00:50:32,880 --> 00:50:35,440
And you say, I don't know a Skylar.

1261
00:50:35,440 --> 00:50:37,440
I I know Whistlin Sarah.

1262
00:50:37,440 --> 00:50:41,440
Yeah, but I know Sarah Bookbinder, but she's riding the rails.

1263
00:50:41,440 --> 00:50:43,600
Son to to Pork and Beans Bill.

1264
00:50:44,640 --> 00:50:45,600
That's her daddy now.

1265
00:50:46,160 --> 00:50:48,800
What if fucking Pork and Beans Bill has like a fucking portable TV?

1266
00:50:48,800 --> 00:50:50,480
He's like, hey, you seen that show?

1267
00:50:50,480 --> 00:50:51,840
Hey, let me show you the show.

1268
00:50:51,840 --> 00:50:52,640
You're real pretty.

1269
00:50:52,640 --> 00:50:53,360
You would be my tech.

1270
00:50:53,360 --> 00:50:55,440
You would be my tech Whistlin Sarah.

1271
00:50:57,520 --> 00:50:58,000
What is it?

1272
00:50:58,000 --> 00:50:59,120
What's your special talent?

1273
00:50:59,120 --> 00:50:59,840
Oh, Whistlin?

1274
00:50:59,840 --> 00:51:02,640
Yeah, Pork and Beans probably should have figured that one out on his own.

1275
00:51:03,840 --> 00:51:04,640
Here's the worst part.

1276
00:51:04,640 --> 00:51:05,440
I don't like you.

1277
00:51:05,440 --> 00:51:06,960
I don't even like Pork and Beans.

1278
00:51:06,960 --> 00:51:08,160
I don't know why I chose this one.

1279
00:51:08,160 --> 00:51:08,880
It's an ironic.

1280
00:51:08,880 --> 00:51:09,840
It's an ironic name.

1281
00:51:09,840 --> 00:51:12,000
It's like when I sing Bette Davis eyes.

1282
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:13,360
People are like, why do you like that song?

1283
00:51:13,360 --> 00:51:13,920
I'm like, I don't.

1284
00:51:13,920 --> 00:51:14,560
It's a fun.

1285
00:51:14,560 --> 00:51:15,760
It's like a fun joke.

1286
00:51:16,480 --> 00:51:18,000
I'm an ironic hobo DJ.

1287
00:51:20,720 --> 00:51:22,560
Man, sometimes I just listen to this show.

1288
00:51:22,560 --> 00:51:23,360
It's pretty funny.

1289
00:51:27,200 --> 00:51:30,080
This is why it must be like this all the time.

1290
00:51:30,080 --> 00:51:32,640
For those of you at home, I can't imagine what it's like.

1291
00:51:34,320 --> 00:51:35,360
What a delight that must be.

1292
00:51:35,360 --> 00:51:36,160
Get that kid out of there.

1293
00:51:36,160 --> 00:51:36,800
You want to Yahoo?

1294
00:51:38,400 --> 00:51:38,640
Sure.

1295
00:51:40,640 --> 00:51:41,920
This one is sent in by Adam P.

1296
00:51:41,920 --> 00:51:44,000
Why don't little girls get to be hobos?

1297
00:51:45,360 --> 00:51:47,200
Why can't they chase their dreams?

1298
00:51:47,200 --> 00:51:49,760
Just get that rambling phase over early.

1299
00:51:49,760 --> 00:51:50,160
All right.

1300
00:51:50,160 --> 00:51:53,040
Take a year off between preschool and first grade.

1301
00:51:53,040 --> 00:51:54,720
Serious, literal question.

1302
00:51:54,720 --> 00:51:58,800
If your daughter was going to be deep, deep, deep into the pageant scene

1303
00:51:58,800 --> 00:52:02,800
or deep, deep, deep into the hobo scene, which scene would you want her to be in?

1304
00:52:02,800 --> 00:52:04,400
You stibbled on a little beard.

1305
00:52:04,400 --> 00:52:05,120
No, hold on.

1306
00:52:05,120 --> 00:52:06,960
Let's make it clear because this is a very sensitive subject.

1307
00:52:06,960 --> 00:52:10,960
We're not talking about homeless people because there's nothing inherently funny about that.

1308
00:52:10,960 --> 00:52:13,120
But when they live on trains, they're hobos, right?

1309
00:52:13,120 --> 00:52:15,280
Yes, we're talking about rambling lifestyle.

1310
00:52:15,280 --> 00:52:16,240
Kings of the rails.

1311
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:18,640
And queens.

1312
00:52:19,360 --> 00:52:21,120
This Yahoo answer is sent in by Adam P.

1313
00:52:21,120 --> 00:52:21,840
Thank you, Adam.

1314
00:52:21,840 --> 00:52:24,160
It's by Yahoo answers user Jalen, who asks,

1315
00:52:25,120 --> 00:52:28,880
I have a food idea for Papa John, but no, if it has been done,

1316
00:52:28,880 --> 00:52:36,080
I want to sell an idea of Papa John Hot Pocket.

1317
00:52:36,080 --> 00:52:37,200
One more time.

1318
00:52:37,200 --> 00:52:38,240
One more time.

1319
00:52:38,240 --> 00:52:40,800
I have a food idea for Papa John, but no, if it has been done,

1320
00:52:40,800 --> 00:52:43,360
I want to sell an idea of Papa John Hot Pocket.

1321
00:52:45,360 --> 00:52:49,520
Sell Papa John Hot Pocket in stores like Food Lion, Walmart.

1322
00:52:51,600 --> 00:52:52,960
He didn't know any other stores.

1323
00:52:53,600 --> 00:52:54,240
Et cetera.

1324
00:52:55,440 --> 00:52:56,320
I love Papa John.

1325
00:52:56,320 --> 00:53:00,240
Okay, so this is not Papa John that will deliver Hot Pockets to you.

1326
00:53:00,240 --> 00:53:01,520
No, he's talking about my little-

1327
00:53:01,520 --> 00:53:02,480
This is Papa John brand.

1328
00:53:02,480 --> 00:53:03,920
Yeah, get an old retail franchise going.

1329
00:53:03,920 --> 00:53:07,680
This is the perfect product for the person that wants that hot,

1330
00:53:07,680 --> 00:53:11,760
fresh Papa John's flavor, but doesn't want the inconvenience of calling.

1331
00:53:12,800 --> 00:53:17,200
Or the inconvenience of eating anything hot and or fresh.

1332
00:53:18,640 --> 00:53:21,040
Yeah, you don't want either of those things to happen.

1333
00:53:21,040 --> 00:53:23,520
Does this person mean like a calzone?

1334
00:53:23,520 --> 00:53:27,920
This, no, I think there are some pretty important structural,

1335
00:53:27,920 --> 00:53:30,720
mechanical, and conceptual differences between a hot pocket and a calzone.

1336
00:53:30,720 --> 00:53:31,920
There are pizza Hot Pockets.

1337
00:53:31,920 --> 00:53:34,320
We're just talking about a branding thing, right?

1338
00:53:34,320 --> 00:53:35,680
Well, it's not just branding, too.

1339
00:53:35,680 --> 00:53:41,360
It's flavor, because you're not going to get that rubbery skin-like texture

1340
00:53:41,360 --> 00:53:44,000
that you really get from a Papa John's pizza from just a regular Hot Pocket.

1341
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:46,560
Don't you fucking start on Papa John's right now, okay?

1342
00:53:46,560 --> 00:53:46,960
Okay.

1343
00:53:46,960 --> 00:53:48,320
I'm tired of it.

1344
00:53:48,320 --> 00:53:49,120
I'm tired of it.

1345
00:53:50,560 --> 00:53:52,160
I understand what this guy's saying.

1346
00:53:52,160 --> 00:53:54,240
Nobody's ever eaten a Hot Pocket and felt good about themselves,

1347
00:53:54,240 --> 00:54:00,080
but what they do feel good about is how efficient that vehicle is.

1348
00:54:01,200 --> 00:54:01,920
Right.

1349
00:54:01,920 --> 00:54:03,520
It's a great food delivery mechanism.

1350
00:54:03,520 --> 00:54:08,000
It is arguably the best, until they invent a gun that you shoot in your mouth,

1351
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:09,920
and then all the food comes out of it.

1352
00:54:09,920 --> 00:54:12,560
Like, this is the best we're going to do.

1353
00:54:14,240 --> 00:54:20,400
Back in the early 1900s, miners' wives used to just send Hot Pockets with them

1354
00:54:20,400 --> 00:54:23,920
to the mines, and then they would put their Hot Pocket on a shovel

1355
00:54:23,920 --> 00:54:26,320
and heat it up with the lamps from their thing.

1356
00:54:26,320 --> 00:54:29,040
And if the Hot Pocket died, then they would know that there was a gas leak,

1357
00:54:29,040 --> 00:54:29,680
and they had to leave.

1358
00:54:29,680 --> 00:54:30,160
Exactly.

1359
00:54:30,800 --> 00:54:33,760
I'll tell you one thing that's really interesting about Hot Pockets,

1360
00:54:33,760 --> 00:54:36,560
and this really changed my whole perspective on the thing,

1361
00:54:36,560 --> 00:54:43,040
is that if you put them in the oven and cook them for like 25 minutes at 350,

1362
00:54:43,040 --> 00:54:46,080
something like that, they are legitimately really tasty.

1363
00:54:46,080 --> 00:54:47,280
Okay, first of all, fuck off.

1364
00:54:47,280 --> 00:54:50,960
It's just the problem is that you...

1365
00:54:51,840 --> 00:54:54,000
I don't know anybody who's ever said,

1366
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:56,480
I'm going to want to eat a Hot Pocket in a half hour.

1367
00:54:56,480 --> 00:55:01,920
No, that's enough time to rethink your Hot Pocket decision like 10 times over.

1368
00:55:01,920 --> 00:55:03,200
You eat a Hot Pocket and you're like,

1369
00:55:03,200 --> 00:55:07,360
I need to have a full meal in my belly in the next 180 seconds.

1370
00:55:07,920 --> 00:55:10,960
I have 180 seconds to put a full meal inside my belly.

1371
00:55:10,960 --> 00:55:13,760
Because at 182 seconds, I have a rethought.

1372
00:55:13,760 --> 00:55:17,680
It is 7.57, Bachelorette is on in three minutes,

1373
00:55:17,680 --> 00:55:19,360
and I'm going to drink a full bottle of red wine.

1374
00:55:19,360 --> 00:55:23,120
I need to put fucking calories in my body in 180 seconds,

1375
00:55:23,120 --> 00:55:24,800
in the length of a commercial break.

1376
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:30,560
The two or three times in my life that I've ever baked a Hot Pocket in the oven,

1377
00:55:30,560 --> 00:55:32,240
even like a frozen burrito or anything like that.

1378
00:55:32,240 --> 00:55:33,760
What the fuck are you guys talking about?

1379
00:55:33,760 --> 00:55:36,640
I can't believe this is something you guys have ever fucking actually done.

1380
00:55:37,200 --> 00:55:37,920
It's delicious.

1381
00:55:37,920 --> 00:55:41,040
This was the time in my life when I was a highfalutin college student.

1382
00:55:41,040 --> 00:55:43,920
Of the few times that I've flown to Los Angeles on a kite.

1383
00:55:43,920 --> 00:55:45,920
Like, what the fuck are you talking about?

1384
00:55:45,920 --> 00:55:47,360
That's not how you do the thing.

1385
00:55:48,960 --> 00:55:51,520
I think it has the directions on the package.

1386
00:55:51,520 --> 00:55:54,080
Yeah, as a fucking goof.

1387
00:55:54,080 --> 00:55:56,720
Hot Pockets says you can microwave a Pop-Tart.

1388
00:55:56,720 --> 00:56:01,200
Take this Hot Pockets to a restaurant and ask if you can borrow their convection oven.

1389
00:56:01,200 --> 00:56:03,520
Like, no, you fucking dullard.

1390
00:56:03,520 --> 00:56:05,840
You put it in the stupid box.

1391
00:56:05,840 --> 00:56:09,280
You put it in the dump box and it fucking heats up your trash food for you.

1392
00:56:09,280 --> 00:56:11,600
The best is when you grill the Hot Pocket.

1393
00:56:11,600 --> 00:56:14,400
It's a really nice outdoor barbecue kind of setting.

1394
00:56:14,400 --> 00:56:17,120
Some friends and your cat is shitting on your herb.

1395
00:56:17,120 --> 00:56:21,600
Throw that bitch on a smoker and oh, you have got yourself a flavor treat.

1396
00:56:21,600 --> 00:56:24,400
Now it's going to be an all day thing because you're going to want to cold smoke it.

1397
00:56:25,040 --> 00:56:31,600
Throw it in the crock pot for 72 hours and you are just gonna shit yourself to death

1398
00:56:31,600 --> 00:56:34,720
because it's a Hot Pocket and that's the only thing that can happen with those.

1399
00:56:34,720 --> 00:56:39,120
I, uh, man, I would buy one though.

1400
00:56:39,120 --> 00:56:44,400
Aren't you curious if they can capture the experience?

1401
00:56:44,400 --> 00:56:46,080
I'll be honest with you.

1402
00:56:46,080 --> 00:56:50,320
Every time I'm at the H-E-B walking in the frozen food aisle and I see that there's a

1403
00:56:50,320 --> 00:56:55,920
new experimental pretzel bread lean pocket flavor, I'll tip my toe in.

1404
00:56:55,920 --> 00:56:57,120
I'm not above it.

1405
00:56:57,120 --> 00:57:02,160
But I fucking recognize the shamefulness of the action.

1406
00:57:02,160 --> 00:57:07,520
Like I'm not like, how can I maximize the pleasure of this Hot Pockets experience?

1407
00:57:07,520 --> 00:57:12,320
What can I do to really add that special twist on this Hot Pocket?

1408
00:57:12,320 --> 00:57:16,720
It's like I just, I'm going to eat this and I'm going to do it when nobody else is around

1409
00:57:16,720 --> 00:57:18,320
and I'm going to fucking pull the blind shut.

1410
00:57:19,360 --> 00:57:21,120
This is what would sell me on it.

1411
00:57:21,120 --> 00:57:27,520
If Papa John's as an added like amenity to buying the Hot Pocket, kept up with the tracker

1412
00:57:27,520 --> 00:57:32,000
idea and tracked your Hot Pocket from freezer to regret.

1413
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:32,240
Yeah.

1414
00:57:32,240 --> 00:57:37,360
And so it started like Travis has had one too many beers, he's late night hungry.

1415
00:57:37,360 --> 00:57:41,200
It's just like, it's fucking instantaneous because it's like, please click when you start

1416
00:57:41,200 --> 00:57:43,920
eating the Hot Pocket and then you click it and they're like, oh, it's already at your

1417
00:57:43,920 --> 00:57:44,240
butt.

1418
00:57:44,240 --> 00:57:45,120
It's already at your butt.

1419
00:57:46,160 --> 00:57:47,040
That's just how it does.

1420
00:57:47,840 --> 00:57:49,280
Travis has begun to regret.

1421
00:57:49,280 --> 00:57:50,320
Oh, he regrets a lot.

1422
00:57:51,920 --> 00:57:52,640
Oh, folks.

1423
00:57:52,640 --> 00:57:53,760
Do you want to tweet this?

1424
00:57:53,760 --> 00:57:56,000
Do you want to tweet the status of your Hot Pocket?

1425
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:57,360
Do you want to tweet your butt shame?

1426
00:57:57,360 --> 00:58:02,640
I double that with double that with fucking Papa John's and you are talking about a human

1427
00:58:02,640 --> 00:58:03,440
super soaker.

1428
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:04,480
Holy shit.

1429
00:58:06,480 --> 00:58:07,440
Holy shit indeed.

1430
00:58:07,440 --> 00:58:09,200
It's just like dropping it down a well.

1431
00:58:09,200 --> 00:58:10,000
Please let me end it.

1432
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:12,560
I don't want to talk about diarrhea anymore for once.

1433
00:58:12,560 --> 00:58:13,600
It's Father's Day.

1434
00:58:13,600 --> 00:58:14,080
Fuck.

1435
00:58:15,680 --> 00:58:19,920
We've had such a lot of fun here today and we really appreciate you joining us for our

1436
00:58:19,920 --> 00:58:21,440
comedy podcast.

1437
00:58:21,440 --> 00:58:25,920
I want to give a quick thank you to some people who've been sending us stuff in our live

1438
00:58:25,920 --> 00:58:29,200
and people who've been sending us stuff in our mailbox.

1439
00:58:29,200 --> 00:58:32,240
That's PO Box 5400 West Virginia 25706.

1440
00:58:32,960 --> 00:58:35,840
Alex in Minneapolis made us some cookies.

1441
00:58:35,840 --> 00:58:37,040
They were delicious.

1442
00:58:38,080 --> 00:58:42,240
One of my favorites came unmarked from Portland.

1443
00:58:42,240 --> 00:58:43,360
There's no name on it.

1444
00:58:43,360 --> 00:58:48,960
There's just a picture of a man wrapped in plastic bags is the is the hilarious post

1445
00:58:48,960 --> 00:58:49,520
card.

1446
00:58:49,520 --> 00:58:55,120
And on the inside, written in Sharpie, it says it's the only way he can climax.

1447
00:58:55,120 --> 00:58:56,720
Thank you.

1448
00:58:56,720 --> 00:58:57,600
Thank you for that.

1449
00:58:57,600 --> 00:58:58,400
That's wonderful.

1450
00:59:00,800 --> 00:59:01,360
Let's see here.

1451
00:59:01,360 --> 00:59:07,280
We got one from Thailand from Lauren that was definitely not Photoshop.

1452
00:59:07,280 --> 00:59:11,920
Yeah, it's Ronald McDonald standing in front of a waterfall and it's fantastic.

1453
00:59:13,040 --> 00:59:20,000
We have a pretty creepy one that just has a picture of a man on his couch drinking beer

1454
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:24,080
and it's unsigned but it's hand drawn and it's lovely.

1455
00:59:24,080 --> 00:59:25,040
So thank you for that.

1456
00:59:25,040 --> 00:59:32,160
And then last postcard came to the brothers McElroy from Mount Rogers National Recreation

1457
00:59:32,160 --> 00:59:35,280
Era from Kyle Latham and Tyler Ewing.

1458
00:59:35,280 --> 00:59:37,680
They were hiking through the Appalachian Trail and they thought of us.

1459
00:59:37,680 --> 00:59:40,000
So thank you so much to you folks.

1460
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:41,040
That's super nice of you.

1461
00:59:42,240 --> 00:59:44,960
And thank you to you for listening to our show.

1462
00:59:44,960 --> 00:59:46,240
Sorry we took a week off there.

1463
00:59:47,040 --> 00:59:49,040
Oh, this is our first show since Max Fun Con.

1464
00:59:49,040 --> 00:59:49,760
It was great.

1465
00:59:49,760 --> 00:59:52,240
Thanks everybody who was there and who supported us.

1466
00:59:52,240 --> 00:59:54,160
It was the most fun weekend.

1467
00:59:54,160 --> 00:59:55,920
Seriously, super great time.

1468
00:59:56,480 --> 01:00:02,160
If you get a second and you can give our show a review on iTunes, that really helps us out

1469
01:00:02,160 --> 01:00:02,320
a lot.

1470
01:00:02,320 --> 01:00:04,720
If you like what you heard, go review it.

1471
01:00:04,720 --> 01:00:06,560
Maybe recommend the show to a friend.

1472
01:00:06,560 --> 01:00:08,480
That would mean a lot to us.

1473
01:00:08,480 --> 01:00:09,360
Please tell a friend.

1474
01:00:09,360 --> 01:00:10,640
You can share the sampler.

1475
01:00:10,640 --> 01:00:11,760
Justin made a new sampler.

1476
01:00:11,760 --> 01:00:18,160
It's really great and it's a great cross section of how fucking dumb we are sometimes.

1477
01:00:18,160 --> 01:00:21,440
It's bit.ly forward slash mabimbam2013.

1478
01:00:21,440 --> 01:00:22,160
Is that right?

1479
01:00:22,160 --> 01:00:22,640
That's right.

1480
01:00:22,640 --> 01:00:22,880
Yeah.

1481
01:00:23,520 --> 01:00:25,120
So thank you for that.

1482
01:00:25,120 --> 01:00:26,320
Please keep sharing the show.

1483
01:00:26,320 --> 01:00:27,520
Thank you for listening.

1484
01:00:27,520 --> 01:00:29,040
And Griffin has one final question.

1485
01:00:31,680 --> 01:00:32,400
Absolutely.

1486
01:00:32,400 --> 01:00:36,080
For the use of our theme song, it's a departure off the album, putting the days to bed.

1487
01:00:36,080 --> 01:00:36,400
Great.

1488
01:00:36,400 --> 01:00:39,200
Great way to just a great song.

1489
01:00:39,200 --> 01:00:42,160
Just a great album and a great song and a great band and a good friend.

1490
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:47,360
I haven't met him personally, but I bet he's a good friend to the friends he's friends with.

1491
01:00:47,360 --> 01:00:47,920
You know what I mean?

1492
01:00:49,600 --> 01:00:50,080
Here we go.

1493
01:00:50,080 --> 01:00:51,440
Oh, last question.

1494
01:00:51,440 --> 01:00:53,040
This one is sent by Charles Decker.

1495
01:00:53,040 --> 01:00:53,920
Thank you, Charles Decker.

1496
01:00:53,920 --> 01:00:56,240
It's by Yahoo Answers user, Ive, who asks.

1497
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:01,440
Is Mr. Pringle still alive?

1498
01:01:04,240 --> 01:01:05,440
I'm Justin McElroy.

1499
01:01:05,440 --> 01:01:06,160
I'm Travis McElroy.

1500
01:01:06,160 --> 01:01:06,960
I'm Griffin McElroy.

1501
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:09,520
This has been my brother over brother to me.

1502
01:01:09,520 --> 01:01:10,480
Kiss your dad.

1503
01:01:10,480 --> 01:01:24,000
Square on the lips.
