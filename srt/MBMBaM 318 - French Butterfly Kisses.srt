1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:30,720
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:46,080
Hello everybody, and welcome to My Brother My Brother,

6
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:50,480
the advice show for the modern era. I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy.

7
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:55,120
I'm your middle-est brother, Travis McElroy. I'm your sweet baby brother, Griffin McElroy.

8
00:00:57,280 --> 00:00:58,480
Yes. Well, that's our show.

9
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:02,320
Thanks for listening, everybody. Justin was supposed to start saying stuff, and then he didn't.

10
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:04,560
Why do I always have to be the one to start saying stuff?

11
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:09,200
I don't know. Ask the past you from the last 317 weeks or so.

12
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:11,840
It has not been that consistent. I'm gonna need statistics.

13
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:17,280
I think it's been at least 308 of 318 times

14
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:21,360
that you have been the one to introduce whatever our opening bit was.

15
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:25,600
Travis and I and Griffin have been recording a remote podcast

16
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:32,080
for 300 and some thousand episodes, and usually we spread across the country

17
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:35,360
like so much silt across the riverbed.

18
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:39,360
But today we're recording a remote podcast

19
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:42,880
when Travis is literally eight minutes from my home.

20
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:46,880
It is a level of, what do you think?

21
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:49,600
Disassociation, like, yeah, we just do it.

22
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:53,600
We just, My Brother My Brother and me, colon, we just can't.

23
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:56,480
Well, here's the thing, looking at it the other way,

24
00:01:56,480 --> 00:02:00,000
it's actually, it's not about distaste for being in Justin's presence,

25
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,240
but rather a respect for Griffin,

26
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:05,600
because what I did not want is for Justin and I to be in the same room

27
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:09,840
making intimate goofs with each other in which we can see each other's faces,

28
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:12,400
while Griffin was like, what are you guys giggling at?

29
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:16,480
Fucking tickle fights, fucking butterfly kisses after bedtime prayers.

30
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:20,800
And I'm over here like trying to replicate butterfly kisses on my own cheek

31
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:22,400
with like a Swiffer or something.

32
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:24,480
He's practicing butterfly kisses on his arm

33
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:26,480
for when he finally gets to do them in real life.

34
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:27,440
It's not the same.

35
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:29,920
Try it with a watermelon.

36
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:31,280
How does it?

37
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:33,200
It's just more real.

38
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:36,240
If you try to give a watermelon butterfly kisses.

39
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:39,280
Especially if you put the watermelon into the microwave for a couple seconds first.

40
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:40,320
Oh yeah.

41
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:44,320
Let it cool though or else you'll burn your eyeballs out of your head.

42
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:46,560
I love this ribald 2000s humor.

43
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:49,120
See, I do French butterfly kisses

44
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:53,840
and that's where you get a little bit of eyeball on it.

45
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:55,120
You just touch corneas.

46
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:57,680
Just touch the cornea very gently.

47
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:01,040
It hurts very much.

48
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:04,080
But Tommy, what about a risk of blindness?

49
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:05,280
No, that's just a myth, honey.

50
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:06,880
Don't worry, it'll be fine.

51
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:07,440
Don't worry.

52
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:12,160
But Tommy, it's below 32 degrees outside and I, ah, ah, ah, that's it.

53
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:12,880
Dead.

54
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:13,840
End of life.

55
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:20,000
I can't wait for Bob Carlisle to drop the sequel to Bee Kisses.

56
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,840
Butterfly necking.

57
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:26,000
Well, I just think there's maybe other types of kisses that you can do with your body.

58
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,760
And I think, I mean, we could sit here and try and shoot the shit about what those would be,

59
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:34,080
but I think Bob Carlisle's probably been at that for about 19 years now.

60
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:37,520
He hasn't come up with anything yet.

61
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:39,600
If there's an amazing sequel to that song,

62
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:44,000
you know he's been digging in that deep water to catch that big fish,

63
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:48,960
to find that one that got away, that sequel to BK2.

64
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:51,200
Yeah, here comes the BK2, everybody.

65
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:52,480
Check out my mixtape.

66
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:53,680
I'm Bob Carlisle.

67
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:57,040
I picture Bob Carlisle walking up to Make Out Point or whatever

68
00:03:57,040 --> 00:04:00,800
and just looking in windows and writing down stuff on his legal pad, which is like,

69
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:01,600
oh, excellent.

70
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:03,280
Can I rhyme that?

71
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:03,780
No.

72
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,760
Albatross kisses.

73
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:06,640
No, no, Bob.

74
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:08,160
That's someone that, no, listen.

75
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:09,360
Albatross kisses.

76
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:10,480
Here's how it works.

77
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:12,080
Extend your elbows out.

78
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:13,200
No, Bob, I can't.

79
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:14,880
Armadillo kisses.

80
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:18,000
No, no, you roll up in the ball and you give everyone leprosy.

81
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:22,320
It's really sad if you look at Bob Carlisle's Instagram,

82
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:24,960
it's just a bunch of pictures of him in front of computers

83
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:28,720
and in various studios with hashtags like BK2 about to drop,

84
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:32,640
BK2 coming along real nice, can't wait to hit you all with BK2,

85
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:38,080
BK2 is in the oven and it's about to pop out real fresh for you, 2016,

86
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:40,880
but the numbers just get lower and lower as you scroll back to the feed.

87
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:44,720
It's like 2008, but BK2 is coming.

88
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:46,240
Y'all get ready.

89
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:47,120
Launch party.

90
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:47,840
Check it out.

91
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:48,320
Check it out.

92
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:51,760
It got sampled in the latest DJ Khaled track.

93
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:52,880
You heard me.

94
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:56,880
We shot it out and he played and it was like Brazilian taper kisses.

95
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:58,640
Like Brazilian taper kisses.

96
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:01,120
I don't know.

97
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:03,760
It's going to be the kind of thing where it's just going to be like overnight,

98
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:06,320
like it's just going to come out with no pomp and circumstance.

99
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:08,400
It's just going to drop one day and I was like,

100
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:10,560
shit, did you know that new BK2 joint dropped?

101
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:11,440
And I was like, what?

102
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:14,000
I didn't read about it in the trades.

103
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:15,520
I didn't know.

104
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:16,240
I didn't know.

105
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:17,120
I would have had a party.

106
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:22,480
Bob's like, no, I'm not putting BK2 on iTunes.

107
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:24,240
They screwed me one too many times.

108
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:27,360
BK2 is only on my space.

109
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:29,200
It's a title exclusive.

110
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:30,080
Title exclusive.

111
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:34,240
Did you know Tidal was founded by Carlyle and Jay-Z

112
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:36,560
to get working together for like the eighth time?

113
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:37,920
Is this Bob Carlyle?

114
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:38,480
Yeah, it is.

115
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:40,960
So are you going to join Tidal?

116
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:41,920
Here's the one thing.

117
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:44,240
The only thing that I need from you is...

118
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:45,200
No, I can't do it.

119
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:47,120
No, we need BK2 to be a title exclusive.

120
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:48,320
It's not ready, Jay-Z.

121
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:49,520
I told you it's not ready.

122
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:52,640
The world's not ready for BK2.

123
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:55,680
Well, call me this, Bob, after I mix BK1 for you.

124
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:57,040
I know, Jay-Z.

125
00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:58,560
Tell me the animal, Carlyle.

126
00:05:58,560 --> 00:05:59,840
I'm dying over here.

127
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:00,720
Capybara.

128
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,040
Don't you fucking tell.

129
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:04,000
Don't you tell a soul.

130
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,280
Get it again, Carlyle.

131
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:07,200
You crazy for this one?

132
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:07,700
Hov!

133
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:08,800
No, that's...

134
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:11,680
Oh, if that was all it was, Jay-Z,

135
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:15,680
I've known Capybara for 13 years now.

136
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:17,440
He's been haunting me in my dreams.

137
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:19,760
I've known it's him, but I just can't catch it.

138
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:20,960
I have dreams sometimes

139
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:23,520
when I'm standing naked in front of the blazing sun

140
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:25,280
and there's a volcano behind me

141
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:27,360
and I can feel its ash pelting down

142
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:29,040
on the back of the nape of my neck.

143
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:31,360
And right in front of me is the Capybara,

144
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:34,160
ever elusive, darting in and out between palm trees

145
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:35,520
and my kindergarten teacher.

146
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:36,720
What does it even look like?

147
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:37,600
I don't know.

148
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:39,680
What she's there, I can't, I try to focus on it

149
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:41,680
as like it fades into the mists.

150
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:43,200
You just gotta Google it, Bob.

151
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:44,480
Oh, oh wait, hold on.

152
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:45,200
Yeah.

153
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:46,320
Oh, okay, yeah, yeah.

154
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:47,520
Okay, okay.

155
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:48,400
How would that kiss?

156
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:49,120
I don't know.

157
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:50,480
Listen, you're the magician here, Bob.

158
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:51,680
I'm just Jay-Z.

159
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:52,880
You're Bob Carlyle.

160
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:54,960
You're the musical genius here, not me.

161
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:58,720
I'm just trying to, I know the animal,

162
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:00,080
I just don't know how to kiss like it.

163
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:03,280
And according to Wikipedia, the word Capybara

164
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:05,360
is derived from a Tupi word,

165
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:08,320
which means one who will eat slender leaves.

166
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:10,240
And I'm wondering if I can sort of incorporate that

167
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:12,320
into the kiss, like maybe you put some grass in your mouth

168
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:13,840
and then you kiss your daughter goodnight.

169
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:16,240
Fuck, no.

170
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:18,960
Tragic news today is Bob Carlyle has been killed

171
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:20,480
in a terrible zoo accident.

172
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:23,600
He leapt into a Capybara enclosure.

173
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:26,720
Onlookers say he was attempting to Capybara kiss.

174
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:28,640
Tragedy strikes tonight.

175
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:30,240
Bob Carlyle has choked to death

176
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:31,840
trying to eat his daughter's hair.

177
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:34,000
He said that's the only thing he could come up with

178
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:34,880
that was like that.

179
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:37,200
And then he died from it.

180
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:39,600
So it's very sad, but we hope we're good.

181
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:42,320
I'm Geraldo Rivera, and I'm here getting ready

182
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:45,280
to smash open Bob Carlyle's vault to see.

183
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:49,600
We're pretty sure the demo for BK2 is in here.

184
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:51,120
I'm joined by special guest Jay-Z

185
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:54,560
and we're about to just smash open Bob Carlyle's vault.

186
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:55,920
Bob would want this.

187
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:57,840
Oh my God, oh my God.

188
00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:01,120
Bob Carlyle is alive and inside the vault.

189
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:03,040
Prestige.

190
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:05,280
David Blaine, I didn't even know

191
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:06,640
you were friends with Bob Carlyle.

192
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:08,960
Hey, let's do some advice.

193
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:13,600
Bob, if you want to come on the show at any time.

194
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:15,280
Yeah, you'd be a welcome guest.

195
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:18,080
If you want to use this as a vehicle debut BK2,

196
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:20,480
we are fucking so ready for it, dog.

197
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:21,760
Yeah, we'll drop it right on here.

198
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:25,680
Once or twice a week, I go to a small corner store

199
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:27,920
and get an egg and cheese sandwich for lunch.

200
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:29,680
Usually there are two guys working there.

201
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:30,960
One man in the cash register

202
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:32,720
and the other in the kitchen or sitting around.

203
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:34,640
I've been doing this for almost a year.

204
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:37,920
So kitchen guy knows my order and will ask if I want

205
00:08:37,920 --> 00:08:40,320
the usual when I go in around lunchtime.

206
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:42,560
One time kitchen guy wasn't there.

207
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:44,720
So I had to get my sandwich from cash register guy.

208
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:48,880
The only thing is he made a noticeably better sandwich

209
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:49,840
than normal.

210
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:51,680
It was crispier, lighter,

211
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:56,960
and a perfectly proportioned ingredients.

212
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:58,480
But that was only for one day.

213
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:01,280
My regular guy is back.

214
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:04,480
And so are the substandard sandwiches.

215
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:09,360
So anything, anyway, let cashier man know it's true calling

216
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:11,840
or should I suck it up and avoid rocking the boat?

217
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:16,160
Thanks pick in Pennsylvania.

218
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:20,080
The only like the only way this could get better

219
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:22,480
is if one day cash register guy wasn't there.

220
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:24,640
And so kitchen guy made him a sandwich was like,

221
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:27,600
all right, that'll be 356 out of five years change.

222
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:29,840
How did you do that that fast?

223
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:31,200
Your fingers were poor.

224
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:33,600
You got me my change so fast.

225
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:34,640
That was crazy.

226
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:37,600
You hand me my change in Mayan nickels.

227
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:38,720
How did you do this?

228
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:39,920
How did you pull this off?

229
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:42,240
This is the blooms.

230
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:44,000
You threw the change up in the air

231
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,160
and the bills landed perfectly in my wallet

232
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:48,640
and the coins landed perfectly in my pocket.

233
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:50,480
You you've got a gift.

234
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:55,200
Don't you do this to me sandwich guy?

235
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:57,280
No, you've got a gift cashier guy.

236
00:09:58,640 --> 00:09:59,840
Okay, so there's cat.

237
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:00,560
There's two.

238
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:01,760
There's two guys there.

239
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:02,400
There's cash.

240
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:04,240
I'm gonna just call him cash.

241
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:09,280
And then Andy cash and what's the name for the kitchen guy?

242
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:10,400
Okay, tango.

243
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:11,760
Okay, so tango.

244
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:16,080
The kitchen guy is not making the sandwiches

245
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:19,920
how you would ideally like them cash guys better.

246
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:22,800
Do you think see this is the problem with promoting up?

247
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:24,400
And I've said this so many times.

248
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:27,920
I bet you he got so good at the kitchen

249
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:30,400
and the boss was so impressed that he got promoted

250
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:31,920
to the person manning the cash register.

251
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:33,360
But this is the problem, right?

252
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:35,280
You promote up and then you don't have the best people

253
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:36,320
doing the best jobs.

254
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,280
This is business 101.

255
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:40,800
Okay, that wasn't a goof.

256
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:42,880
You're just somewhere in there.

257
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:43,520
Ayn Rand.

258
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:46,320
No, I'm just saying that I think that that's probably

259
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:48,960
what happened here is like, I don't think it's that.

260
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:51,600
I'm not sure that they missed their calling.

261
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:55,120
I'm saying that they like maybe got promoted out

262
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:56,880
of the guy making the sandwiches

263
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:58,720
even though he's like still got it.

264
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:03,200
So I still got the heat and I bet he hates me at a desk jockey.

265
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:06,640
Every morning he comes in, he opens up the shop every morning

266
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:09,840
and he just like runs his hands over like the kitchen counters

267
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:11,200
and he's just like, hello old friend.

268
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:14,720
And he touches the egg and cheese sandwich fixings.

269
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:19,680
Cash register guy, why do they have you working a desk

270
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:22,800
and not getting out there and cooking those good sandwiches?

271
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:24,080
I shot a kid.

272
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,040
Cash register guy.

273
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:32,720
I don't even know why you would do that

274
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:34,880
while cooking breakfast sandwiches,

275
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:37,760
but I also don't know why you wouldn't go to prison.

276
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:41,120
My sandwiches are too good.

277
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:42,320
And then at the end of the movie,

278
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:45,360
he, John McCain's about to get shot

279
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:47,040
and he makes a really good breakfast sandwich.

280
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:48,640
He's like, you did it.

281
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:54,640
Um, uh, I mean, there's nothing you can do about this, right?

282
00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:56,160
Like, you know, now I think you've,

283
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:59,040
you can't say you two should switch jobs

284
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:00,560
cause that's crazy.

285
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:00,880
Can't.

286
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:04,160
Um, you know now that the sandwiches

287
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:07,440
that you ate for over a year were not good.

288
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:08,000
Right?

289
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:08,640
Maybe they're okay.

290
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:11,040
That makes them worse by comparison too though, right?

291
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:12,960
Yeah, so I don't think you can go back here

292
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:14,400
knowing what you know.

293
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:16,160
Let me, I would like to pitch something.

294
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:19,040
Something we don't normally endorse here

295
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:20,400
on my brother, my brother and me.

296
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:22,800
But you know, it's, it's 2016.

297
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:25,280
I'm saying maybe you go bold and brassy.

298
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:29,440
You walk in tomorrow, you order a sandwich

299
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:31,760
and you say, but I want it made by him.

300
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:33,280
And you point at cash register guy

301
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:34,400
and kitchen guy's like, what?

302
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:35,840
And cash register guy's like, what?

303
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:38,400
And you just say, he made a sandwich for me once

304
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:39,920
and it was the best version I've ever tasted.

305
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:41,040
I want him to make it.

306
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:42,560
Kitchen guy, I want you to watch

307
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:44,800
and I want you to do exactly that, like that from now on

308
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:46,320
because I'm a paying customer.

309
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:46,800
This is America.

310
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:48,000
Cause I'm a huge asshole.

311
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:48,320
I'm the biggest asshole ever.

312
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:49,360
You're not my friends.

313
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:50,880
These people aren't your friends, Griffin.

314
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:52,800
You're paying for goods and services.

315
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:54,640
You should get the best sandwich available.

316
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:56,640
You should not take a second class sandwich

317
00:12:56,640 --> 00:12:58,720
because you're afraid to ask for what you want.

318
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:02,080
Travis is, um, Travis is giving great advice,

319
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:04,320
especially if you want to spend the next year

320
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:08,000
enjoying a breakfast sandwich of eggs and cheese and spit

321
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,360
because that's what you're getting.

322
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:10,560
You're that asshole.

323
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:12,560
I'm not saying it's not a risky maneuver.

324
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:14,080
It is definitely a risky maneuver.

325
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:15,120
And if it works, great.

326
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:17,440
If it doesn't, no more sandwiches for you.

327
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:20,080
Not only at this restaurant, but perhaps anywhere.

328
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:22,480
Oh, make no mistake.

329
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:24,080
This breaks two ways.

330
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:24,640
Yeah.

331
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:26,800
One, it's all fixed.

332
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:28,000
This will not happen.

333
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,240
Two, you never go to this place again.

334
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:32,080
You might even have to move

335
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:34,720
if there's some kind of intricate sandwich network

336
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:37,840
in this city where word spreads about that demanding guy

337
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:39,920
who wanted cash for this guy to make the sandwich.

338
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:42,640
But otherwise, you're stuck eating sandwiches

339
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:45,760
for the rest of your life that you know are subpar.

340
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:49,200
And now you've tasted ambrosia

341
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:52,800
and you can't go back to your regular humdrum lifestyle.

342
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:56,160
If I know anything from like your Alice in Wonderland's

343
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:58,560
through the Looking Glass kind of books,

344
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:00,800
you can't go back to your humdrum lifestyle.

345
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:02,960
You're going to dream of that fantasy sandwich.

346
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:05,520
Yeah, yeah.

347
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:07,680
I mean, you could buy the place.

348
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:09,280
Yeah, now we're talking.

349
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:10,160
Now we're talking.

350
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:11,760
You can kickstart it.

351
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:13,200
Kickstart to buy the place.

352
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:14,720
I need this, please, Indiegogo.

353
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:16,960
I actually think, okay, okay.

354
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:18,800
I think you could ease into it.

355
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:19,920
You guys are familiar with,

356
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:23,040
I first heard Al Franken referred to it

357
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:24,400
as kitting on the square.

358
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:24,880
Yes.

359
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:27,360
So you could kid on the square and say, listen,

360
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:29,840
hey, I just want to let you know

361
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:31,360
you better watch out for your job

362
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:33,440
because this guy over here,

363
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:35,040
when he made my sandwich,

364
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:36,720
it was the best it's ever been.

365
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:39,120
I love your work, but he was killing it.

366
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:41,760
And then it's like, very good one, very good joke.

367
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:42,800
And it's like, you know what?

368
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:44,640
Let's keep this joke going.

369
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:45,440
Why don't you come over here

370
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:46,880
and show him exactly what you did.

371
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:49,120
You know what would be fucking like super funny?

372
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:51,680
What if you just left?

373
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:54,400
What if you left right now?

374
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:56,080
What if you gave up cooking forever?

375
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:58,960
I'm saying you could do,

376
00:14:58,960 --> 00:15:00,880
you could kid your way into it.

377
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:02,240
When you like, you know what?

378
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:03,440
Just relax, just watch him

379
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:04,800
and tell him what you do differently.

380
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:05,920
Cause I want to know what your secret is.

381
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:06,880
Cause that guy's is great.

382
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:08,720
So you're backing into it with a compliment.

383
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:11,360
What you do is you'll get that guy on your side.

384
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:12,320
That's a secret.

385
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:15,280
You got to convert that guy to like being on your team

386
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:18,160
and it will turn kitchen guy against you.

387
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:19,840
But you can convert this with laughter.

388
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:22,000
You can just make it into a big funny joke

389
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:22,960
where at the end of the joke,

390
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:25,200
the punchline is what a sandwich.

391
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:26,800
You could also just make it up straight up comment

392
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:28,320
and say, I would like two sandwiches

393
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:30,400
and I'd like you all to compete for my favor.

394
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:32,240
May the odds be ever.

395
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:33,440
It's the hungry games.

396
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:36,720
I mean, that's actually a good idea Travis.

397
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:37,920
I mean, I definitely wouldn't phrase it

398
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:38,720
the way you phrased it,

399
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:39,520
but I'd say like,

400
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:41,840
I need two sandwiches prepared simultaneously

401
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:43,520
and served up to me in the exact same time.

402
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:46,160
I have a very, very particular fetish

403
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:47,280
and a particular set of skills

404
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:48,720
that make me a nightmare for men like you.

405
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:51,680
Those skills are,

406
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:53,520
I am just a really shitty customer.

407
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:56,880
I'm a bad, yeah, I'm not a great human either.

408
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:57,760
How about a Yahoo?

409
00:15:58,320 --> 00:15:59,040
Please.

410
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:00,240
I just wanna tell y'all,

411
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:03,840
this is like a fun little update on my life

412
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:06,400
is I have the Wikipedia page open for capybara here

413
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:07,920
to sort of look into their physiology

414
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:08,720
and how they might kiss.

415
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:12,960
And Wikipedia has a conservation status

416
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:14,560
for like animal species

417
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:17,680
to let you know like how they do in vis-a-vis extinction.

418
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:22,560
Capybara, lowest rating,

419
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:25,600
least concern is the rating on this conservation status.

420
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:27,280
Keep it up, capybara,

421
00:16:27,280 --> 00:16:28,480
like you're my favorite animal

422
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:30,080
and you're doing so good out there.

423
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:31,520
Keep doing what you're doing

424
00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:32,720
because it's great.

425
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:33,360
By which I mean,

426
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:35,680
we don't hunt you for sport or food.

427
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:37,200
So this rating is saying like,

428
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:37,840
if someone's like,

429
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:39,200
you know, I'm just worried about capybara,

430
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:40,080
it's like, don't.

431
00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:41,600
No, dog, don't even worry about it.

432
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:44,000
The other thing it could be saying is like,

433
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,200
if you gotta kill something.

434
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:47,920
Hey, do you wanna feel alive?

435
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:48,800
Sure, we all do.

436
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:51,120
That would be a fuck joke.

437
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:52,400
If you're a capybara and you see it,

438
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:54,560
you're like, so least concern,

439
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:57,440
so it's fine if I just like die.

440
00:16:57,440 --> 00:16:59,200
You just write it in marker,

441
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:01,440
like Derek, highest concern,

442
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:02,640
Derek the capybara,

443
00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:03,440
please do not hunt.

444
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:05,840
I can't even joke about this.

445
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:10,880
How about this Yahoo that was sent in by Zoe Kinski,

446
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:11,440
riding high.

447
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:11,920
Thank you, Zoe.

448
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:13,040
It's by Yahoo answers users.

449
00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:14,240
Something has gone wrong

450
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:15,600
because our website sucks.

451
00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:21,600
But there's an antacid banner advertisement

452
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:23,920
at the top of the page featuring Larry the Cable Guy.

453
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:26,080
So let's just say Larry the Cable Guy asks,

454
00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:29,760
how do I teach my dog discipline

455
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:31,040
through the martial arts?

456
00:17:33,040 --> 00:17:34,400
I have a problem with my dog.

457
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:35,760
He poops all over the house,

458
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:36,880
chews on my footwear,

459
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:38,560
constantly knocks over the trash cans,

460
00:17:38,560 --> 00:17:40,400
makes a mess in the house every time I leave.

461
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:42,080
Just an overall lack of discipline

462
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:43,200
and structure in his life.

463
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:45,680
He's also a bit of a pushover with other dogs,

464
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:47,840
gets constantly intimidated and pushed around.

465
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:50,080
His bark leaves much to be desired as well.

466
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:53,360
Almost seems as if he is saying sorry every time he barks.

467
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:55,440
He definitely needs the discipline

468
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:56,800
that only martial arts can teach.

469
00:17:56,800 --> 00:17:58,400
Obviously grappling arts out of the question

470
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:00,080
since he lacks opposable thumbs.

471
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:01,840
But what other options are there for him?

472
00:18:02,560 --> 00:18:04,640
How do I teach him how to roundhouse kick other dogs

473
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:06,240
every time they get in his face?

474
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:08,160
Is there any way to teach him to channel his chi

475
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:09,760
in order to produce a more menacing bark?

476
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:11,920
I heard Kung Fu teaches several animal forms.

477
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:13,360
Is there a dog form in there?

478
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:14,800
What about karate?

479
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:16,480
Are there any empty handed techniques

480
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:17,760
made especially for dogs?

481
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:20,080
I simply want my dog to be a dog amongst dogs,

482
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:22,160
a menacing terror, alpha all the way,

483
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:23,920
and to stop pooping all over the house.

484
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:28,240
One, I think there's a huge missed opportunity

485
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:32,160
to just immediately rule out any of the grappling arts

486
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:36,080
because what's the last thing a dog's opponent would expect?

487
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:37,200
Yeah, that's a good point.

488
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:38,000
Right?

489
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,760
Is to use their weight against him.

490
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:40,720
Get him real low to the ground

491
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:42,160
and throw him with a jujitsu throw.

492
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:47,680
Can you read the bit about animal forms again?

493
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:49,840
I heard Kung Fu teaches several animal forms.

494
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:51,600
Is there a dog form in there?

495
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:52,640
Okay, so that-

496
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:54,320
That's a misnomer.

497
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:57,040
There's a misunderstanding that has occurred here.

498
00:18:57,040 --> 00:18:58,080
That is not what that means.

499
00:18:58,080 --> 00:18:59,200
Although I will say this.

500
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:02,160
First of all, Kung Fu Panda.

501
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:04,160
Second of all, in Kung Fu Panda,

502
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:05,680
like the snake uses snake style.

503
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:06,640
And that's my second of all,

504
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:08,720
is that I think if a snake is gonna learn Kung Fu,

505
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:10,160
I think snake style would be like,

506
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:11,680
oh, that's my jab, what's your jab?

507
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:14,080
Yeah, I don't think there's like an immediate correlation,

508
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:17,920
but if a dog was going to learn one form, dog form-

509
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:18,880
Dog form would be it.

510
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:20,720
Doggy style makes the most sense.

511
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:21,840
Yeah, so-

512
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:23,280
You gotta teach them doggy style.

513
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:25,280
Doggy style's a very funny joke.

514
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:26,160
Thank you.

515
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:27,920
I just, I didn't want that to be the thing

516
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:29,680
that people tweeted at us after the episode.

517
00:19:29,680 --> 00:19:30,160
No, yeah, yeah.

518
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:31,920
How did you not say doggy style?

519
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:32,400
Yeah, sure.

520
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:32,880
Yeah.

521
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:34,160
Yeah, I hate when people do that.

522
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:35,680
We need a segment at the end of each bit

523
00:19:35,680 --> 00:19:36,960
called low hanging fruit.

524
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:37,280
Yeah.

525
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:40,080
Just like, here's the things that we know we could have said

526
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:42,640
but we just like left on the scrap pile.

527
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:44,720
So you don't have to go rummaging through our garbage.

528
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:46,880
I've actually just been building my whole comedy style

529
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:47,920
based off of that since like day one.

530
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:48,880
It's worked so far.

531
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:49,520
Yeah, yeah.

532
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,840
Here's what I'll say.

533
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:56,160
This is one thing that if we don't say it,

534
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:57,200
people are gonna tweet at us.

535
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,720
You should never, with no exceptions,

536
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:04,080
you should never do Kung Fu on a dog with one exception.

537
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:08,560
So let me get this straight, with no exceptions,

538
00:20:08,560 --> 00:20:10,240
you should never do Kung Fu on a dog.

539
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:12,720
100% of the time, you should never do Kung Fu on a dog.

540
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:13,760
But there's only one time,

541
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:15,360
there's only one instance in which

542
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:19,120
it is acceptable and or encouraged

543
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:21,440
and that is if you are teaching that Kung Fu to the dog.

544
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,080
Well, we're missing an obvious answer here.

545
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:27,120
Okay, I was a dog trainer and I could tell you

546
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:29,440
the easiest way for any dog to learn

547
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:32,720
is to observe other dogs doing it.

548
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:34,560
So what you actually need in this situation

549
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:36,080
is like a Mr. Miyagi dog.

550
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:38,560
You need an older dog who's out of the game,

551
00:20:38,560 --> 00:20:41,600
who's like, no, I don't do Kung Fu anymore.

552
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:42,480
I don't do that anymore.

553
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:44,720
And then he sees your dog getting picked on

554
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:46,640
by the other dogs at the dog park

555
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:49,040
and finally Mr. Miyagi dog is like,

556
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:50,080
all right, come on, dog.

557
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:53,120
I'll show you how to catch flies with chopsticks

558
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:57,120
and trim bonsai trees and wax on and wax off

559
00:20:57,120 --> 00:20:58,400
and then you don't have to do shit

560
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:00,240
but then you do have to worry about your dog

561
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:01,600
getting super good at Kung Fu

562
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:06,400
and just beating you up whenever it wants food and shit.

563
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:12,640
I just googled Karate Dog.

564
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:22,400
There was a 2004 movie called The Karate Dog.

565
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:26,480
Tell me more.

566
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:29,680
It's got Simon Rex, Jamie Presley were in it.

567
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:32,160
It's also got Pat Morita makes an appearance.

568
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:35,760
Let me just keep reading.

569
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:38,800
It looks like John Voight was in the motion picture

570
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:41,040
and who was the voice of Cho-Cho,

571
00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:44,720
the titular Karate Dog who in the fucking cover art

572
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:46,960
is also holding a police badge.

573
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:50,960
Excuse me, Karate Police Dog.

574
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:52,960
It looks to me like, yes, let me double.

575
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:54,400
Yes, it was Chevy Chase.

576
00:21:55,040 --> 00:21:56,240
Of course it was.

577
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:58,880
No, man, we make fun of it.

578
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:03,040
Chevy Chase gives a hard time for being kind of a dill weed

579
00:22:03,040 --> 00:22:05,040
to some people it sounds like to me

580
00:22:05,040 --> 00:22:08,480
but it sounds like maybe he's had kind of a hard road.

581
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:10,320
We should probably try to get him a little slack.

582
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:13,840
This box art is he lays in bed at night

583
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:15,680
just thinking about Karate Dog and weeping.

584
00:22:16,560 --> 00:22:20,080
Y'all, this box art for The Karate Dog

585
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:26,080
is the most buck wild JPEG I've ever streamed onto my Laffy.

586
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:31,040
I'm talking about like a bullmastiff

587
00:22:31,040 --> 00:22:34,240
with a fucking necktie and an eye patch.

588
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:37,680
I'm talking about the Karate Dog is taking up

589
00:22:37,680 --> 00:22:41,040
two thirds of the cover and he's got a little sash on

590
00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:43,120
and also a police badge.

591
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:45,760
And then there's one weird corner dog

592
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:49,520
who you can only see like a third of its horrified face

593
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:51,360
as it peeks into the corner as if to say,

594
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:52,800
what's happening in this movie?

595
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:53,760
John Voight, no!

596
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:58,320
People who are also fans of the Flophouse

597
00:22:58,320 --> 00:23:00,000
will appreciate that when you click on the poster

598
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:03,040
for Karate Dog image related images with that.

599
00:23:03,040 --> 00:23:05,120
Oh, a talking cat.

600
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:06,720
The talking cat?

601
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:08,880
The spiritual cousin to Karate Dog.

602
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:12,000
Okay, so there's another poster for Karate Dog

603
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:16,640
that one, does not mention Chevy Chase.

604
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:20,640
Two, as near as I can tell, it looks like Karate Dog.

605
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:22,240
Okay, this is essential.

606
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:22,740
Oh, wow.

607
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:27,040
It is still wearing the badge around its neck.

608
00:23:27,040 --> 00:23:29,120
And I, is that a black belt?

609
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:31,040
Yeah, I mean, don't get me wrong.

610
00:23:31,040 --> 00:23:33,520
They're not gonna make a movie about a dog that does karate

611
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:36,320
if it's just starting out learning the martial arts.

612
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:40,800
This is the Karate Dog, he's a yellow belt.

613
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:41,280
Oh.

614
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:42,000
Really?

615
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:42,500
All right.

616
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:45,520
Other note about the trailer.

617
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:47,680
Hi, this is, hey, this is Jon Voight.

618
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:50,000
Yeah, is this my agent?

619
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:50,960
Yes, it is.

620
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:55,440
Listen, I was looking at the cover art for Karate Dog.

621
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:58,800
Am I really credited below Simon Rex?

622
00:23:58,800 --> 00:24:03,040
Does Simon Rex really get billing above me, Jon Voight?

623
00:24:03,040 --> 00:24:04,400
Yeah, that's the way it should go.

624
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:05,600
Sorry, we didn't have a lot of room.

625
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:07,600
What with all the badges and crazy dogs.

626
00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:12,000
Is this, seeing as how it's called the Karate Dog,

627
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,480
is it a spiritual successor to the Karate Kid?

628
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:17,520
Does it go like the Karate Kid, one, two, three,

629
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:18,880
Karate Kid with-

630
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:21,520
Hilary Swank?

631
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:23,200
Hilary Swank, and then the Karate Dog.

632
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:25,040
Like, is this all in the same canon?

633
00:24:25,040 --> 00:24:26,800
Is this Karate Kid canon?

634
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:27,360
Pat Morita.

635
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:30,080
Pat Morita's appearance would intimate as much.

636
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:31,840
Yeah, so is this canonical?

637
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:36,480
I don't know if this is part of the quadrilogy

638
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:38,640
of Karate Kid films now.

639
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:40,800
It is now, as far as I'm concerned.

640
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:43,600
Okay, this is gonna be a power hipster move.

641
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:45,280
If your friends are like, I like the Karate Kid.

642
00:24:45,280 --> 00:24:45,840
Like, oh, do you?

643
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:46,640
Have you seen them all?

644
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:48,480
And they're like, yeah, I'm like, even Karate Dog?

645
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:49,360
And they're like, what?

646
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:51,440
And you're like, yeah, I didn't think so.

647
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:53,760
And then you cut them out of the forums or whatever.

648
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:55,120
Hey, great news for everybody.

649
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:56,400
Cancel your evening plans.

650
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:58,320
You can stream the entirety of Karate Dog

651
00:24:58,320 --> 00:24:59,600
for free on YouTube.

652
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:00,000
Oh my God.

653
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,040
You can just watch the whole thing.

654
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:02,480
Later.

655
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:04,080
Can we show the dog Karate Dog

656
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:06,240
to teach it to stop being such a piece of shit?

657
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:08,960
Be more like this dog.

658
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,040
Sound more like Chevy.

659
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:12,480
Chevy Shays.

660
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:13,760
Be more like Chevy Shays.

661
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:17,760
Do you think Chevy Chase ever lies down

662
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:22,000
on his armless sofa and he calls it his Chevy Chase Lounge?

663
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:23,920
He probably does, right?

664
00:25:23,920 --> 00:25:26,240
Hey, how about another question though?

665
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:31,120
Nine Lives made $17.1 million at the box office

666
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:35,440
and received a 7% positive rating from Rotten Tomatoes.

667
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,160
Speaking of trash, we have another segment

668
00:25:38,160 --> 00:25:40,400
that we cooked up last week

669
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:45,760
where people who are in the trash and garbage industry

670
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:48,640
are gonna tell us the stories of the oddest things

671
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:51,600
they've ever collected in their day-to-day lives.

672
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:51,840
Yeah.

673
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:54,960
And Travis, you said you received some of these

674
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:58,560
in a new segment we're calling Trash Stories.

675
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:01,520
Yeah, we got a bunch of them.

676
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:03,600
Griffin was gonna sing the jingle for Trash Stories.

677
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:11,040
A trash story is a new kind of way to love.

678
00:26:11,040 --> 00:26:13,600
We received a lot of trash stories this week.

679
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:18,960
Some of them so gross to trump any humor

680
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:20,320
that was present in them.

681
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:21,120
Oops, oh no.

682
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:25,680
Well, we used to get almost like 90% of our emails

683
00:26:25,680 --> 00:26:27,280
were dookie questions.

684
00:26:27,280 --> 00:26:30,080
So I feel like people needed a place to put that energy

685
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:31,520
and I'm worried that it's gonna funnel

686
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:33,600
into Trash Stories Mountain.

687
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:36,640
You're not wrong, but there were a couple

688
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:39,760
that contained no overt grossness.

689
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:43,440
This one is from Cassandra in Tennessee.

690
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:45,920
My stepdad is a garbage man and over the last few years

691
00:26:45,920 --> 00:26:48,480
he has scored enough fully functional camping gear

692
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:52,000
for my family of five, me, husband, and three kids

693
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,000
to take a three-week long camping trip

694
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:55,680
without purchasing a thing.

695
00:26:55,680 --> 00:26:59,680
We had sleeping bags, cots, two coolers, a huge tent,

696
00:26:59,680 --> 00:27:03,520
flashlights, backpacks, hiking boots, and much more.

697
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:05,760
All courtesy of other people's trash.

698
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:07,440
Pictures of the trip attached.

699
00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:10,400
That's so amazing.

700
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:12,160
That's two things.

701
00:27:12,160 --> 00:27:13,520
First of all, you're welcome.

702
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:16,560
Because I think most of that probably came from me

703
00:27:16,560 --> 00:27:20,080
because I have gone camping once in the last six years

704
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:22,800
and I got very bad diarrhea in the woods.

705
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:23,760
And guess what?

706
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:25,200
When you have diarrhea, the woods,

707
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:26,720
there is no comfort for you there.

708
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:29,120
You will find no solace.

709
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:31,440
And so I said, okay, goodbye sleeping bags,

710
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:33,920
goodbye cots, goodbye two coolers, goodbye huge tent,

711
00:27:33,920 --> 00:27:35,920
flashlights, backpacks, hiking boots, and much more.

712
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:40,000
And it sounds like your stepdad sort of had a bonanza

713
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:41,600
in my can.

714
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:50,400
I have to say, the second thing is that this,

715
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:53,360
I'm totally into a dude like free cycling

716
00:27:54,320 --> 00:27:56,560
or whatever it's called, freeganism.

717
00:27:56,560 --> 00:27:59,440
I'm like a totally, I'm super down with it, reduce, reuse.

718
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:00,000
Loving it.

719
00:28:00,560 --> 00:28:03,360
A tent, at that point-

720
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:04,480
A tent is where you had a problem?

721
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:05,920
Cause mine was hiking boots.

722
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:08,320
I mean, you can delouse those, whatever,

723
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:12,640
but like a tent is you're sleeping in trash.

724
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:16,480
It is a house made of trash.

725
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:18,080
Man, that's a nice tent though.

726
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:19,680
Is it a nice tent?

727
00:28:19,680 --> 00:28:21,120
I'll forward you guys the image.

728
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:22,480
I mean, you don't need to forward it to me.

729
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:25,440
It's mine and it was.

730
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:26,640
I have two big questions.

731
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:29,280
One is not a question, just an observation.

732
00:28:29,280 --> 00:28:31,920
I really liked the image of everybody

733
00:28:31,920 --> 00:28:34,000
who has thrown this stuff out who went camping

734
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:35,920
was just like, never again.

735
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:38,240
I'm never doing this again.

736
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:40,640
I'm leaving all this in the garbage.

737
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:41,680
I'm never going again.

738
00:28:41,680 --> 00:28:43,360
Like you didn't even want to store it somewhere.

739
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:44,720
You're just like that certain

740
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:46,080
that you would never go camping again.

741
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:47,680
Yes, I was.

742
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:51,600
The tent, there's two options here

743
00:28:52,160 --> 00:28:53,920
that I find very puzzling.

744
00:28:53,920 --> 00:28:57,040
The first is that the tent was left

745
00:28:57,040 --> 00:28:59,600
in the garbage fully assembled.

746
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:01,120
That seems unlikely to me.

747
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:03,280
I don't even know how you would transport that.

748
00:29:03,280 --> 00:29:05,200
The second is that your stepfather

749
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:07,600
knows how to put together a tent

750
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:10,400
without any instructions or pieces or anything.

751
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:12,640
That will be, I cannot fathom that.

752
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:14,640
Tents are the hardest things to make

753
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:16,560
and that he was able to put that together

754
00:29:16,560 --> 00:29:17,600
without any sort of instruction.

755
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:18,640
I think that's fascinating.

756
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:21,440
Well, I can believe that Justin

757
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:22,800
because I think that the stepfather

758
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:26,160
had the forethought to collect this stuff

759
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:28,800
over many years, according to this email,

760
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:30,960
thinking one day I will be able to gift

761
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:34,880
my stepdaughter an entire set of camping stuff.

762
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:36,640
I think that's amazing.

763
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:38,080
We have another one as well.

764
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:42,880
This one is from the woman formerly known as Trash Lady.

765
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:44,240
I worked for a trash company

766
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:46,240
in the sales department until recently.

767
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:47,680
The weirdest call I've gotten

768
00:29:47,680 --> 00:29:51,200
was from a man who had an abundance of cucumbers

769
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:54,640
and was looking for a 30 cubic yard roll-off container

770
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:55,920
to put them in.

771
00:29:55,920 --> 00:29:59,520
The container is eight foot by 22 foot by six feet.

772
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:02,080
Quite a few cucumbers.

773
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:04,640
The weirdest part was the man's immediate need

774
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:05,840
for the container.

775
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:07,200
He was desperate.

776
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:10,480
However, the cucumbers probably were still good

777
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:14,000
because he invited me to come take as many as I wanted.

778
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:15,360
I regret not going.

779
00:30:18,160 --> 00:30:20,240
Okay, wouldn't that be the last call you make?

780
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:22,240
Do you think that that person's with the day on the phone

781
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:24,000
calling everybody they've ever met like,

782
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,480
hey, did you remember how you were telling me one time

783
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:29,120
that you really needed a bunch of cucumbers right now?

784
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:30,400
Well, good news.

785
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:31,120
Come on down.

786
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:35,040
Do you need pickles and have a lot of patience?

787
00:30:35,040 --> 00:30:35,600
Good news.

788
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:42,480
This is, this is, that is so many cucumbers.

789
00:30:43,040 --> 00:30:45,120
I'm trying to math it out in my head,

790
00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:47,840
but that's like a thousand feet of cucumbers.

791
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:49,040
And I think you fit-

792
00:30:49,040 --> 00:30:49,840
It's a lot of cucumbers.

793
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:51,680
I think you could fit like a bunch of,

794
00:30:51,680 --> 00:30:54,800
a bunch of cuques per foot, right?

795
00:30:55,920 --> 00:30:58,960
And the only explanation is that

796
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:01,280
it's some kind of like rolled doll situation

797
00:31:01,280 --> 00:31:04,400
where it's like the man who wished for too many cucumbers

798
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:06,000
and like he made a wish like,

799
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:07,280
oh Lord, I just love,

800
00:31:07,280 --> 00:31:09,680
I wish I had more cucumbers than I knew what to do with.

801
00:31:09,680 --> 00:31:10,960
I just love them so much

802
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:13,440
because how do you, how does that sneak up on you?

803
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:15,440
How do you wake up one day and you're like,

804
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:16,480
where the, hold on.

805
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:18,640
Oh shit, I have too many cucumbers.

806
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:23,360
James, James and the many, many, many regular size peaches.

807
00:31:23,920 --> 00:31:26,000
I've done that, I've done that to myself before.

808
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:26,880
You go to the store and you're like,

809
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:28,000
do I have cucumbers at home?

810
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:30,080
No, I don't think I do.

811
00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:31,040
Yeah, I should get some more.

812
00:31:31,040 --> 00:31:34,320
And then you do that 10,000 times in a day.

813
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:35,920
I'm in there.

814
00:31:35,920 --> 00:31:37,040
I know how, I know what that's like.

815
00:31:37,040 --> 00:31:39,040
Maybe, Travis, you mentioned pickles.

816
00:31:39,040 --> 00:31:40,560
Maybe this was not for disposal.

817
00:31:40,560 --> 00:31:43,760
Maybe this was, I need to make a lot of pickles now.

818
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:44,000
Yeah.

819
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,480
I want to, I have a Scrooge McDuck fetish,

820
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:50,640
but with a weird twist, instead of coins.

821
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:52,400
Trav, do you have any more before we?

822
00:31:52,400 --> 00:31:54,160
Just, those are the two that I pulled.

823
00:31:54,160 --> 00:31:57,200
I don't, I don't want it to become a trash show, Justin.

824
00:31:57,840 --> 00:31:58,640
That's fine.

825
00:31:58,640 --> 00:32:01,280
Any more so than it already definitely is.

826
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:02,080
Let's get amazing.

827
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:14,880
Folks, I want to tell you about Squarespace.

828
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:17,680
My brother, my brother, me is supported by Squarespace,

829
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:20,080
which doesn't have anything to do with it.

830
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:22,800
This is, listen, this is completely independent.

831
00:32:22,800 --> 00:32:24,560
Just a commercial I decided to do.

832
00:32:24,560 --> 00:32:26,080
And they also gave us money for it.

833
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:27,760
Whether you need a landing page, a beautiful gallery,

834
00:32:27,760 --> 00:32:29,600
a professional blog, or an online store,

835
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:32,160
it's all included with your Squarespace website.

836
00:32:32,160 --> 00:32:34,720
It's easy to create a website with Squarespace.

837
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:35,600
I can vouch for that.

838
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:36,720
Travis can vouch for that.

839
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:40,960
If you've never done it before, this is the place to start.

840
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:43,200
Everybody's making web pages now.

841
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:45,840
And it's time to stake your claim in the great Wild West.

842
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:47,520
And the best part is they're gonna give you

843
00:32:47,520 --> 00:32:51,280
a free custom domain to help people get to your thing.

844
00:32:51,280 --> 00:32:52,640
That's not actually the freest thing.

845
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:54,080
They're just giving you letters.

846
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:55,840
That's not, I said it's the best.

847
00:32:55,840 --> 00:32:57,120
That's just some free letters.

848
00:32:57,120 --> 00:32:58,880
That's not actually the best, but it is good.

849
00:32:59,520 --> 00:33:01,360
There's beautiful templates.

850
00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:03,440
You can design a best in class online store

851
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:04,960
with Squarespace's award-winning templates,

852
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:06,560
customizable settings, and more.

853
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:07,680
All without a single plugin.

854
00:33:07,680 --> 00:33:10,320
If you need to make a web page, and you do,

855
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:11,760
because otherwise nobody knows,

856
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:13,680
how can I Google you if you don't have a web page?

857
00:33:13,680 --> 00:33:14,160
I can't.

858
00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:14,880
That's the answer.

859
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:16,720
You gotta work on your SEO, I think.

860
00:33:17,280 --> 00:33:20,560

863
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:28,800
I can vouch, like Justin said,

864
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:31,920
I made macroyshows.com on Squarespace.

865
00:33:31,920 --> 00:33:35,120
It took me like 45 minutes, like nothing.

866
00:33:35,120 --> 00:33:38,480
And it's so easy to update so we can like add new stuff to it

867
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:41,920
and, you know, add pictures, change stuff to it whenever we need to.

868
00:33:41,920 --> 00:33:44,080
And it was like no time at all.

869
00:33:44,800 --> 00:33:46,160
And it looks really good.

870
00:33:46,160 --> 00:33:47,200
I'm very proud of it.

871
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:48,800
And it was really easy.

872
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:51,120
So like, I'm a big fan of Squarespace.

873
00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:55,360
And not only that, like their customer service is amazing.

874
00:33:56,640 --> 00:33:57,680
It's so easy to figure out.

875
00:33:57,680 --> 00:33:59,200
And if you do have an issue, there's someone to help you.

876
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:01,440
Plus, like YouTube is full of videos

877
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:03,360
about how to make it look even better.

878
00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:04,320
Like it's amazing.

879
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:06,560
You really want to use Squarespace.

880
00:34:06,560 --> 00:34:07,440
I'm a big fan.

881
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:10,240
Can they, it says you get free custom domain.

882
00:34:10,240 --> 00:34:12,080
And I'm very excited about that.

883
00:34:12,640 --> 00:34:15,760
Can they just get me KarateDog.com?

884
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:17,360
Because I just went to it and it's available,

885
00:34:17,360 --> 00:34:18,960
but it's for sale for $2,800.

886
00:34:21,120 --> 00:34:24,160
And like, will they foot the bill for that?

887
00:34:24,160 --> 00:34:25,280
Or am I going to have to pay for that?

888
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:26,480
Or how does the-

889
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:28,400
Griffin, it's going to pay for itself.

890
00:34:30,400 --> 00:34:33,040
I want to tell you guys about another sponsor we have this week,

891
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:34,000
which is MeUndies.

892
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:37,360
MeUndies is, it's just the best undies.

893
00:34:37,360 --> 00:34:39,520
I'm, I'm, I think I'm, let me check.

894
00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:41,040
I'm wearing a pair right now.

895
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:42,000
Me too.

896
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:43,120
Which, me too.

897
00:34:43,120 --> 00:34:44,320
What fun designer, you guys,

898
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:45,680
you guys have this like summer one

899
00:34:45,680 --> 00:34:47,760
with all the inflatable toys and stuff.

900
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:50,800
No, mine's blue and it's got leaves and stuff on it.

901
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:52,960
Wait, shit, Griffin, are we wearing the same one?

902
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:54,400
Aw, bud, yeah, it happened.

903
00:34:54,400 --> 00:34:54,720
Love that, love that.

904
00:34:54,720 --> 00:34:56,800
Yeah, synergy.

905
00:34:56,800 --> 00:34:58,800
Synergy, corporate synergy.

906
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:02,240
Whether you're wearing a suit or you're wearing sweats,

907
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:04,080
I mean, those are the only two things I wear.

908
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:05,840
You're going to spend-

909
00:35:05,840 --> 00:35:07,520
Or a sweatsuit.

910
00:35:07,520 --> 00:35:09,600
You're spending 24 hours a day in your undies,

911
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:13,120
but your underwear is probably pretty boring

912
00:35:13,120 --> 00:35:14,400
and probably pretty uncomfortable

913
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:17,120
and it probably starts, you probably have like-

914
00:35:17,120 --> 00:35:18,320
It's probably evil.

915
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:22,000
Just a few tablespoons of just water in there at any time.

916
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:24,160
I want to tell you about MeUndies

917
00:35:24,160 --> 00:35:26,480
because MeUndies is made of sustainably sourced modal,

918
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:28,960
which is a fabric that's twice as soft as cotton.

919
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:33,600
It's indescribably soft and it indescribably fits good.

920
00:35:33,600 --> 00:35:35,920
And you're going to know why they're called the world's

921
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:37,200
most comfortable underwear.

922
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:38,720
And if you don't have your first pair of MeUndies,

923
00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:40,400
they're free, no questions asked.

924
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:41,840
Shipping's free in the US and Canada

925
00:35:41,840 --> 00:35:43,280
and you can save up to $8 a pair

926
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:45,120
with the MeUndies subscription plan.

927
00:35:45,120 --> 00:35:46,800
And in order to get down on that plan

928
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:47,760
or get a single pair,

929
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:50,000
you can get 20% off your first order

930
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,000
if you go to MeUndies.com slash my brother.

931
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:54,400
That's MeUndies.com slash my brother.

932
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:56,400
Get 20% off your first order.

933
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:59,280
One more time, MeUndies.com slash my brother.

934
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:01,040
You know what I do whenever I get MeUndies?

935
00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:03,760
I throw, we get the monthly thing.

936
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:04,880
So every month we get a new pair.

937
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:06,960
And whenever I get one,

938
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:09,920
I throw a pair of non-MeUndies away

939
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:14,400
and I am so close to reaching 100% MeUndies.

940
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:16,400
I'm within striking distance.

941
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:19,760
Let me tell you, I've done it in my cross country move.

942
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:23,120
Not a single old pair of stupid old underwear

943
00:36:23,120 --> 00:36:24,240
made its way with me.

944
00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:26,240
It's all MeUndies, I'm never looking back.

945
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:28,960
I'm going whole hog, by which I mean,

946
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:31,120
the only thing my hog will touch.

947
00:36:31,120 --> 00:36:34,240
I mean my penis.

948
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:37,920
I can't wait for next week's edition of Trash Stories,

949
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:41,840
which is like, I was cleaning out some dude's apartment trash.

950
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:44,480
First of all, I stole his patio furniture.

951
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:45,440
That was tight.

952
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:46,640
I'm pretty sure that was trash

953
00:36:46,640 --> 00:36:49,360
because it was in basically essentially a big trash tarp.

954
00:36:49,360 --> 00:36:52,640
Anyway, went in through just like looking around,

955
00:36:52,640 --> 00:36:54,640
just perusing for treasure

956
00:36:54,640 --> 00:36:57,440
and just replaced my whole underwear collection

957
00:36:57,440 --> 00:36:58,400
with bad underwear.

958
00:36:58,400 --> 00:37:00,320
But oh well.

959
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:04,560
I've got a personal message here for Ross from Megan.

960
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:06,640
Happy fifth anniversary.

961
00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:08,800
I'm so glad I could get the guys whose voices

962
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:11,040
you probably know better than my own to tell you.

963
00:37:11,680 --> 00:37:12,880
Next available.

964
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:15,040
I really hope, the reason I said the next available

965
00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:17,680
is I really hope that this is five months later

966
00:37:17,680 --> 00:37:21,920
and like Megan withheld saying happy fifth anniversary

967
00:37:21,920 --> 00:37:24,080
to Ross until we could say it.

968
00:37:24,080 --> 00:37:26,640
And Ross was like, hey, happy fifth anniversary.

969
00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:27,680
And Megan just went, mm-hmm.

970
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:31,040
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm, yep.

971
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:32,400
It is a happy mm.

972
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:35,440
Yep, mm, yep, mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

973
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:36,080
You'll see.

974
00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:39,280
In five months.

975
00:37:41,600 --> 00:37:43,520
Here's one for the brothers and family.

976
00:37:43,520 --> 00:37:45,520
This is just for all of us to enjoy.

977
00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:47,520
And this is from Timbo in Austin.

978
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:50,160
It says, dear brothers, sorry if this isn't goofable.

979
00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:51,280
I wanted to say thank you

980
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:53,360
for letting us feel like a part of your family.

981
00:37:53,360 --> 00:37:55,680
For some of us, it's a profound experience

982
00:37:55,680 --> 00:37:56,960
that can get us through tough times.

983
00:37:56,960 --> 00:37:58,720
Just like the holidays.

984
00:37:58,720 --> 00:38:00,000
Oops-a-daisy.

985
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:03,600
Just wanted to make you know, sure you all knew

986
00:38:03,600 --> 00:38:05,600
you provide the world with more than just

987
00:38:05,600 --> 00:38:07,280
those sweet, sweet goose.

988
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:08,160
Good job.

989
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:09,600
Did I do it right?

990
00:38:09,600 --> 00:38:10,880
That's from Timbo in Austin.

991
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:11,600
Thank you, Tim.

992
00:38:11,600 --> 00:38:12,240
That's very kind.

993
00:38:12,240 --> 00:38:13,680
You mentioned the holidays.

994
00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:13,920
Yeah.

995
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:16,400
So I hope the way we've repaid your kind message

996
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:19,200
was waiting eight months to read it.

997
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:22,080
I think that was the cause of Justin's oops-a-daisy,

998
00:38:22,080 --> 00:38:24,160
not the fact that we help people get through the holidays

999
00:38:24,160 --> 00:38:24,720
with our podcast.

1000
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:25,120
Yeah, that was the oops-a-daisy.

1001
00:38:25,120 --> 00:38:26,560
That's all we're helping to do the holiday?

1002
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:27,060
Shit.

1003
00:38:27,060 --> 00:38:27,680
Oh, no.

1004
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:29,680
Oops-a-daisy, this was like December 25th.

1005
00:38:29,680 --> 00:38:31,200
Tim writes this very kind message,

1006
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:32,880
and we're like, yeah, Timbo, we're

1007
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:34,880
going to get to that real soon, my man.

1008
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:36,160
Yeah, welcome to the family.

1009
00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:38,480
Sit right there for eight literal months.

1010
00:38:39,120 --> 00:38:43,840
Sit in our virtual reading room until fall,

1011
00:38:43,840 --> 00:38:46,000
and then we're going to get to this very kind message.

1012
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:46,720
But thank you, Tim.

1013
00:38:46,720 --> 00:38:47,520
That was very nice.

1014
00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:48,160
Thank you.

1015
00:38:48,160 --> 00:38:49,040
Very nice of you.

1016
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:53,280
Mugs, shirts, stickers, patches, tanks, and more

1017
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:56,400
are yours for the purchasing at maxfundstore.com.

1018
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:58,400
Hey, you already love the podcasts,

1019
00:38:58,400 --> 00:39:00,560
so why not take this to the next level

1020
00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:05,360
and outfit your home and bod with our merch, maxfundstore.com,

1021
00:39:05,360 --> 00:39:06,800
because if you have to wear a shirt,

1022
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:08,080
it should be one of ours.

1023
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:13,280
Brothers, my husband has spent every free moment

1024
00:39:13,280 --> 00:39:15,680
of the past six months building and perfecting

1025
00:39:15,680 --> 00:39:19,040
a screen-accurate replica of a Stormtrooper's armor.

1026
00:39:19,680 --> 00:39:22,480
Not only that, but he's constructed a custom blaster

1027
00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:24,720
with some sick lights and sound effects.

1028
00:39:24,720 --> 00:39:26,400
This is just, this is not going to be a question.

1029
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:26,960
I can feel it, right?

1030
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:28,160
This is just braggy.

1031
00:39:28,160 --> 00:39:29,600
This is a person who's talking about how cool.

1032
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:32,560
I have never been more proud, correct?

1033
00:39:32,560 --> 00:39:34,880
But alas, he is hiding his light under a bushel

1034
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:37,600
for fear of what others, friends, family, coworkers

1035
00:39:37,600 --> 00:39:38,320
will think.

1036
00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:41,440
He was recently accepted to the 501st Legion,

1037
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:43,040
and I wanted to sing his praises,

1038
00:39:43,040 --> 00:39:45,120
but I held back out of respect for his wishes.

1039
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:47,840
Is there any way I can convince him

1040
00:39:47,840 --> 00:39:49,680
to take his awesomeness public?

1041
00:39:49,680 --> 00:39:52,320
And that's just from Gmail.

1042
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:58,400
First of all, the 501st Legion is a Legion of Stormtroopers

1043
00:39:59,520 --> 00:40:02,800
that, like, they do marches, they attend events,

1044
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:06,720
they're like a really big deal Star Wars, like,

1045
00:40:06,720 --> 00:40:08,400
battalion of fans.

1046
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:10,960
That's a really cool honor.

1047
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:13,520
And you have to have, like, perfect armor to join,

1048
00:40:13,520 --> 00:40:15,360
and they do, like, lots of charity work,

1049
00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:17,760
and they visit hospitals, and when the rebellion comes,

1050
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:21,520
they will be the fucking first to stand against it and crush it.

1051
00:40:21,520 --> 00:40:24,560
Do they have one of these types of groups

1052
00:40:25,360 --> 00:40:32,000
for Austin Powerses that I could get sent in my audition tape for?

1053
00:40:32,560 --> 00:40:34,960
But it would probably be called, like, the 69th Legion,

1054
00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:37,360
because that's, like, Austin Powers, right?

1055
00:40:37,360 --> 00:40:38,080
You got it.

1056
00:40:38,080 --> 00:40:39,360
Swinging groovy, yes.

1057
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:41,520
Yes, that is exactly it.

1058
00:40:41,520 --> 00:40:42,880
Congratulations, Travis.

1059
00:40:42,880 --> 00:40:43,760
Thank you very much.

1060
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:45,360
My bag is a man, yes.

1061
00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:47,040
That is my bag, baby.

1062
00:40:47,040 --> 00:40:47,760
You have found it.

1063
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:50,560
Thank you for returning my bag to me.

1064
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:51,920
Crunky.

1065
00:40:51,920 --> 00:40:52,960
Crunky, my mojo's gone.

1066
00:40:55,520 --> 00:40:58,560
I think that this is actually a big opportunity,

1067
00:40:58,560 --> 00:41:01,760
because you are the only one who knows his secret identity.

1068
00:41:02,320 --> 00:41:04,480
So you could start to read stories in the newspaper

1069
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:06,720
of, like, a mysterious stormtrooper.

1070
00:41:06,720 --> 00:41:08,000
Oh my god.

1071
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:08,880
Yeah, I'm sorry.

1072
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:09,760
Yes, Travis.

1073
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:10,640
Yeah, this is the bet.

1074
00:41:10,640 --> 00:41:13,120
Like, don't take this awesomeness public.

1075
00:41:13,120 --> 00:41:14,480
Let him keep it secret.

1076
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:17,600
Because if I went over to one of any of my friend's houses

1077
00:41:17,600 --> 00:41:18,560
right now, and they're like,

1078
00:41:18,560 --> 00:41:20,240
I think it's time that I show you something.

1079
00:41:20,240 --> 00:41:22,000
And then they, like, pull down on the book,

1080
00:41:22,720 --> 00:41:25,920
and they're on their bookshelf,

1081
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:27,120
and then it rotates out,

1082
00:41:27,120 --> 00:41:30,240
revealing their perfect fucking stormtrooper armor.

1083
00:41:30,240 --> 00:41:33,840
That person would be a legend forever in my mind.

1084
00:41:33,840 --> 00:41:35,840
I would never forget that moment.

1085
00:41:35,840 --> 00:41:36,240
Right?

1086
00:41:36,240 --> 00:41:37,120
Yeah, that would be amazing.

1087
00:41:37,120 --> 00:41:38,320
You don't want that to be public.

1088
00:41:38,320 --> 00:41:41,120
You want it to be a secret that you share with, like,

1089
00:41:41,120 --> 00:41:42,640
secrets are cool too.

1090
00:41:42,640 --> 00:41:44,000
You know, it may just be,

1091
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:45,840
you know how sometimes I like to wear

1092
00:41:45,840 --> 00:41:48,160
one of my sexier pairs of me undies underneath

1093
00:41:48,160 --> 00:41:49,280
when I head into the office,

1094
00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:51,920
just to make me feel like I'm hiding a little secret.

1095
00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:52,560
You know what I mean?

1096
00:41:52,560 --> 00:41:54,960
And I think that maybe this could be that for him.

1097
00:41:54,960 --> 00:41:56,400
Maybe he wants that, like,

1098
00:41:57,040 --> 00:41:59,200
feeling of knowing he does have a secret.

1099
00:41:59,200 --> 00:42:00,000
Like, if somebody's like,

1100
00:42:00,640 --> 00:42:02,800
yeah, as if you could ever show up in the office

1101
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:03,760
dressed like a stormtrooper,

1102
00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:05,920
and he's like, uh-huh, you got me again, Doug.

1103
00:42:05,920 --> 00:42:06,880
But in his back, his head's up.

1104
00:42:06,880 --> 00:42:08,800
With your weirdly specific bullying.

1105
00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:17,600
Doug always knows just which buttons to push with pin-point accuracy.

1106
00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:21,840
With blaster-like specificity.

1107
00:42:21,840 --> 00:42:23,760
He knows exactly where to shoot.

1108
00:42:24,720 --> 00:42:26,400
I think that that's the question.

1109
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:27,360
Justin is correct.

1110
00:42:27,360 --> 00:42:30,400
Is this a, no, this is just for me kind of thing?

1111
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:31,760
Because that's awesome.

1112
00:42:31,760 --> 00:42:33,520
But if this is, like, him going,

1113
00:42:33,520 --> 00:42:35,360
I don't know, I'm afraid that I'd, like,

1114
00:42:35,360 --> 00:42:36,320
people wouldn't like it.

1115
00:42:36,320 --> 00:42:37,520
I think that's so far off.

1116
00:42:37,520 --> 00:42:40,000
I don't know, especially in this day and age

1117
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:42,240
where Star Wars has become so mainstream,

1118
00:42:42,880 --> 00:42:45,600
I don't know anyone who wouldn't be like,

1119
00:42:45,600 --> 00:42:46,640
that's awesome.

1120
00:42:47,280 --> 00:42:50,240
And not only that, because I think people also respond well

1121
00:42:50,240 --> 00:42:54,080
to, like, when you put care and time into a thing.

1122
00:42:54,080 --> 00:42:56,640
And if they don't, like, their opinions don't matter.

1123
00:42:56,640 --> 00:42:59,200
But especially when you say, like, friends and family,

1124
00:42:59,840 --> 00:43:03,200
like, if they react shittily, they ain't your friends,

1125
00:43:03,200 --> 00:43:05,440
and you should discount them as family as well.

1126
00:43:05,440 --> 00:43:07,600
Because something like that, that you, like,

1127
00:43:07,600 --> 00:43:09,840
put so much time and effort and, like,

1128
00:43:09,840 --> 00:43:11,840
really focus your energy on,

1129
00:43:12,560 --> 00:43:14,560
I would think that anybody worth their salt

1130
00:43:14,560 --> 00:43:16,400
would think that that was amazing.

1131
00:43:16,400 --> 00:43:19,600
Unless it's family's all hardcore Star Trek nerds.

1132
00:43:21,440 --> 00:43:24,160
They've been building their accurate Borg costumes.

1133
00:43:24,720 --> 00:43:28,160
Yeah, I guess that's the only thing they got, right?

1134
00:43:28,160 --> 00:43:29,360
Like, what else would it be?

1135
00:43:29,360 --> 00:43:32,960
Like, here's my Klingon pants.

1136
00:43:33,760 --> 00:43:34,960
I made a Batleth.

1137
00:43:34,960 --> 00:43:37,040
This is a couple coat hangers that you twist around

1138
00:43:37,040 --> 00:43:37,680
a butter knife.

1139
00:43:38,560 --> 00:43:43,360
It is gonna make hanging out with the 501st Legion buddies

1140
00:43:43,360 --> 00:43:44,720
a little bit awkward.

1141
00:43:44,720 --> 00:43:46,640
If, like, after they visit the hospital,

1142
00:43:46,640 --> 00:43:49,360
they're all taking their armor off and heading in to

1143
00:43:49,360 --> 00:43:51,840
slam some Gatorade and go over to Chuck E. Cheese's

1144
00:43:51,840 --> 00:43:53,760
or Billy Bob's Wonderland, depending on where they live.

1145
00:43:54,320 --> 00:43:57,440
And they're like, well, how about you, new fella?

1146
00:43:57,440 --> 00:43:58,400
How did you think of it?

1147
00:43:58,400 --> 00:43:59,520
All right, it was fun.

1148
00:44:00,080 --> 00:44:02,560
Well, you can go ahead and, no, I'm good.

1149
00:44:02,560 --> 00:44:07,040
I'm just gonna leave it on, I think.

1150
00:44:07,040 --> 00:44:08,400
Well, okay.

1151
00:44:08,400 --> 00:44:10,320
I don't have a lot of room in my Ford Fiesta,

1152
00:44:10,320 --> 00:44:11,920
and I did offer to give you a ride with me,

1153
00:44:11,920 --> 00:44:13,520
but that's fine if you-

1154
00:44:13,520 --> 00:44:14,560
Yeah, I'm fine.

1155
00:44:14,560 --> 00:44:16,000
I'll hop in the back.

1156
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:17,840
Let's all take a big group picture.

1157
00:44:17,840 --> 00:44:18,480
Masks off.

1158
00:44:18,480 --> 00:44:19,200
What do you say, guys?

1159
00:44:20,160 --> 00:44:21,360
I've actually got to go.

1160
00:44:21,360 --> 00:44:22,000
Traitor!

1161
00:44:22,880 --> 00:44:25,440
That's a little Star Wars joke for everybody in the audience.

1162
00:44:25,440 --> 00:44:27,520
He pulls off his helmet and it's Mark Hamill.

1163
00:44:27,520 --> 00:44:29,440
I was like, what the fuck?

1164
00:44:29,440 --> 00:44:32,720
Travis did a fun joke, too, from Star Wars.

1165
00:44:32,720 --> 00:44:33,200
Thank you.

1166
00:44:34,560 --> 00:44:38,640
Who's your favorite Star Wars?

1167
00:44:40,640 --> 00:44:42,960
That would be the fucking funniest bit, wouldn't it?

1168
00:44:42,960 --> 00:44:45,680
Like, roll up to the 500 first and just be like,

1169
00:44:46,560 --> 00:44:48,640
who's your guys' favorite Star Wars?

1170
00:44:51,040 --> 00:44:55,360
Which one of the Starmen do you think has the best super powers?

1171
00:44:55,360 --> 00:44:59,840
I like Iron Man, Izzy.

1172
00:45:01,920 --> 00:45:03,040
I like Bando.

1173
00:45:03,920 --> 00:45:05,600
What happened to Jango Phat?

1174
00:45:05,600 --> 00:45:05,840
Who?

1175
00:45:06,880 --> 00:45:07,760
Jango-

1176
00:45:07,760 --> 00:45:09,120
The Jango Unchained.

1177
00:45:09,120 --> 00:45:09,840
Jango Phat?

1178
00:45:11,360 --> 00:45:12,080
Jango Phat.

1179
00:45:13,040 --> 00:45:13,840
Do you guys know Yahoo?

1180
00:45:14,400 --> 00:45:14,640
Sure.

1181
00:45:15,440 --> 00:45:19,840
If you're listening to this guy who made the Stormtrooper armor,

1182
00:45:19,840 --> 00:45:20,880
that's awesome.

1183
00:45:20,880 --> 00:45:21,520
Don't be ashamed.

1184
00:45:21,520 --> 00:45:22,560
It's fucking great.

1185
00:45:22,560 --> 00:45:24,480
How about this one sent in by Dana Scarborough?

1186
00:45:24,480 --> 00:45:25,200
Thank you, Dana.

1187
00:45:25,200 --> 00:45:27,440
It's by Yahoo Answers user Tim Harrington who asks,

1188
00:45:28,160 --> 00:45:30,400
how to work on my radio voice?

1189
00:45:31,360 --> 00:45:32,800
This is all caps, by the way.

1190
00:45:32,800 --> 00:45:35,440
So like, I think they need work on their radio voice

1191
00:45:35,440 --> 00:45:37,440
because right now it's just all shouting.

1192
00:45:38,240 --> 00:45:40,880
I'm wondering how I can work on my radio voice.

1193
00:45:40,880 --> 00:45:43,120
I'll be going to college for radio broadcasting,

1194
00:45:43,120 --> 00:45:44,960
but how can I work on my voice?

1195
00:45:44,960 --> 00:45:47,440
I want to do late night jazz hours

1196
00:45:47,440 --> 00:45:50,720
and I know that you have to have a soft trained comforting voice.

1197
00:45:52,720 --> 00:45:53,520
Interesting.

1198
00:45:53,520 --> 00:45:54,240
What a twist.

1199
00:45:54,240 --> 00:45:58,320
Why do you feel like you have to do that before you get to college?

1200
00:45:58,320 --> 00:46:02,560
Listen, if they can't teach you how to have a smooth comforting jazz voice,

1201
00:46:02,560 --> 00:46:05,440
then maybe you're overpaying for your college education.

1202
00:46:05,440 --> 00:46:08,560
If they can't whiplash you into a smooth jazz voice,

1203
00:46:08,560 --> 00:46:10,960
then what are you even doing at that conservatory?

1204
00:46:10,960 --> 00:46:13,520
No, smoother, at my tempo.

1205
00:46:13,520 --> 00:46:15,600
Hey everybody, we've got a com-

1206
00:46:15,600 --> 00:46:16,640
No, smoother!

1207
00:46:18,640 --> 00:46:20,480
You threw my mug of chamomile.

1208
00:46:20,480 --> 00:46:24,400
I couldn't figure out a way to do that sound effect.

1209
00:46:24,400 --> 00:46:25,760
Slow it down.

1210
00:46:25,760 --> 00:46:26,960
Lower the timbre.

1211
00:46:26,960 --> 00:46:29,440
As we all know, there's three types of radio voices.

1212
00:46:29,440 --> 00:46:30,480
There's your JB-

1213
00:46:30,480 --> 00:46:31,520
They're JB Millers.

1214
00:46:31,520 --> 00:46:32,080
Oh, okay.

1215
00:46:32,080 --> 00:46:33,920
Well, that's not a joke that anybody's going to get.

1216
00:46:34,560 --> 00:46:37,040
Well, if they lived in Huntington, they would.

1217
00:46:37,040 --> 00:46:39,600
Yeah, no, let's broaden our net a little bit.

1218
00:46:40,480 --> 00:46:45,360
There's the douche and that covers, I would say, most of it.

1219
00:46:45,360 --> 00:46:47,360
Can you give us an example, Griffin?

1220
00:46:47,360 --> 00:46:48,800
Because that could be anything.

1221
00:46:48,800 --> 00:46:52,560
Well, and again, this has nothing to do with the personality of the person.

1222
00:46:52,560 --> 00:46:53,600
It's just the voice, right?

1223
00:46:53,600 --> 00:46:57,360
So it's just like, hey everybody, here I come, doing my voice.

1224
00:46:57,360 --> 00:47:00,960
Nobody talks like this, but here I come at you with the weather on the 10s.

1225
00:47:00,960 --> 00:47:04,160
And he's on the 10 and the nine and the eight and the seven.

1226
00:47:04,160 --> 00:47:05,520
He's running very slowly.

1227
00:47:05,520 --> 00:47:08,800
If I can announce each yard that he's crossing and touchdown.

1228
00:47:08,800 --> 00:47:11,280
Come on down to Blockbuster Video.

1229
00:47:11,280 --> 00:47:12,960
Have we got a deal for you?

1230
00:47:12,960 --> 00:47:14,080
Coming up after the break,

1231
00:47:14,080 --> 00:47:16,480
Toni Bazel's back with her follow-up to Mickey.

1232
00:47:16,480 --> 00:47:18,800
Mickey too, and also Bob Carlisle.

1233
00:47:18,800 --> 00:47:20,560
He is dropping it.

1234
00:47:20,560 --> 00:47:24,000
BK2, we got the world premiere streaming from Tidal.

1235
00:47:25,040 --> 00:47:27,360
And then, but that voice could also be like shock jock,

1236
00:47:27,360 --> 00:47:29,200
like Bob Carlisle's in the studio.

1237
00:47:29,200 --> 00:47:31,040
He's got a nut out.

1238
00:47:31,040 --> 00:47:32,320
I can't believe this.

1239
00:47:32,320 --> 00:47:33,680
Show us your boob.

1240
00:47:33,680 --> 00:47:36,000
Show us your boob, Bob Carlisle.

1241
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:37,120
Loving it, loving it.

1242
00:47:37,680 --> 00:47:40,080
Bob Carlisle getting wet and wild.

1243
00:47:40,080 --> 00:47:43,680
Playing strip poker with Bob Carlisle in the studio.

1244
00:47:43,680 --> 00:47:46,320
And he has lost his shirt and his pants.

1245
00:47:46,320 --> 00:47:47,840
And he's got a nut out.

1246
00:47:47,840 --> 00:47:49,520
Ooh, ooh, ooh, yeah.

1247
00:47:49,520 --> 00:47:52,400
I can see Bob Carlisle's butthole and everything.

1248
00:47:52,400 --> 00:47:53,200
It's great.

1249
00:47:53,200 --> 00:47:55,440
Using him like a butterfly periscope.

1250
00:47:56,400 --> 00:47:59,120
Next up, we paid homeless Reggie 50 bucks

1251
00:47:59,120 --> 00:48:01,440
to smell Bob Carlisle's taint.

1252
00:48:04,720 --> 00:48:06,080
Now here's butterfly kisses too.

1253
00:48:07,760 --> 00:48:08,800
Too hot for TV.

1254
00:48:11,200 --> 00:48:13,120
Unedited explicit tag.

1255
00:48:13,120 --> 00:48:14,080
Okay, so that's one voice.

1256
00:48:14,080 --> 00:48:15,040
That's one voice.

1257
00:48:15,040 --> 00:48:17,680
And then there's soft voice.

1258
00:48:18,320 --> 00:48:19,040
And this covers-

1259
00:48:19,040 --> 00:48:20,960
Like your NPR voice?

1260
00:48:20,960 --> 00:48:23,600
Yeah, but that could also just be jazz.

1261
00:48:23,600 --> 00:48:25,920
Like, hey everybody, this is Griffin.

1262
00:48:26,560 --> 00:48:28,240
I gotta stop doing stuff like that

1263
00:48:28,240 --> 00:48:31,120
because I do get a lot of ASMR sort of reports in.

1264
00:48:31,120 --> 00:48:32,800
Just like, hey, you did it for me, thanks.

1265
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:36,000
I'm glad that that's a service we provide.

1266
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:38,880
I guess so too, but it's not my intention

1267
00:48:38,880 --> 00:48:41,280
unless I explicitly say that it is.

1268
00:48:41,280 --> 00:48:42,480
It feels like a violation.

1269
00:48:42,480 --> 00:48:45,600
But it's like, hey everybody, this is my soft voice.

1270
00:48:45,600 --> 00:48:49,520
And coming up on the weather on the 10s

1271
00:48:49,520 --> 00:48:53,520
and also a thing happened in this country

1272
00:48:53,520 --> 00:48:55,760
and Griffin couldn't even think of an example

1273
00:48:55,760 --> 00:48:57,280
of what that might be.

1274
00:48:58,000 --> 00:48:59,360
My favorite thing about that voice,

1275
00:48:59,360 --> 00:49:02,000
especially in like a smooth jazz station setting,

1276
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:04,400
is that the history of some of these artists

1277
00:49:04,400 --> 00:49:07,040
is very, it could be very murky.

1278
00:49:07,040 --> 00:49:08,000
There can be some bets.

1279
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:09,520
So to use that voice to be like,

1280
00:49:09,520 --> 00:49:13,920
and while on a heroin bender, he stabbed three people

1281
00:49:13,920 --> 00:49:17,440
and then went on to write, stars in the sky, enjoy.

1282
00:49:17,440 --> 00:49:20,080
Like that voice, like that to me

1283
00:49:20,080 --> 00:49:21,680
is like the best part of that voice.

1284
00:49:21,680 --> 00:49:23,760
It's like you could say really horrendous things

1285
00:49:23,760 --> 00:49:25,600
on that voice, people are like, oh, that's nice.

1286
00:49:25,600 --> 00:49:26,960
It's really pleasant.

1287
00:49:26,960 --> 00:49:29,600
And you gotta be careful not to juxtapose

1288
00:49:29,600 --> 00:49:31,040
because you don't want to turn on your radio

1289
00:49:31,040 --> 00:49:34,720
and hear somebody say, and then next up we paid

1290
00:49:34,720 --> 00:49:39,720
homeless Reggie $50 to smell Bob Carlisle's taint.

1291
00:49:41,760 --> 00:49:43,760
It makes it even sonically more unpleasant.

1292
00:49:43,760 --> 00:49:48,760
And then the third one, of course, is.

1293
00:49:49,120 --> 00:49:50,560
Oh no, Griffin said there were three.

1294
00:49:52,960 --> 00:49:54,080
No, I got this.

1295
00:49:55,200 --> 00:49:59,680
The third one is of course, impressions.

1296
00:49:59,680 --> 00:50:04,680
You know, that classic radio voice, impressions.

1297
00:50:05,840 --> 00:50:10,960
The mainstay of every used car ad that's ever been.

1298
00:50:10,960 --> 00:50:12,800
It's like, hey everybody, I'm Austin Powers.

1299
00:50:12,800 --> 00:50:15,520
Come on down to Roger Beasley Toyota

1300
00:50:15,520 --> 00:50:19,440
and get yourself a Prius, baby, my wife.

1301
00:50:19,440 --> 00:50:20,320
You should buy this.

1302
00:50:20,320 --> 00:50:22,560
Wait, I wasn't even doing a voice.

1303
00:50:22,560 --> 00:50:24,000
You should buy this car.

1304
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:25,360
I can't do any voices.

1305
00:50:25,360 --> 00:50:26,160
What was I doing?

1306
00:50:26,160 --> 00:50:27,040
Who is that?

1307
00:50:27,040 --> 00:50:28,320
Who was that, Travis?

1308
00:50:28,320 --> 00:50:29,520
I'm so scared.

1309
00:50:29,520 --> 00:50:30,800
I was trying to do Bill Clinton,

1310
00:50:30,800 --> 00:50:32,160
but it sounded like Keanu Reeves.

1311
00:50:33,280 --> 00:50:34,080
Bill Clinton is hard.

1312
00:50:34,080 --> 00:50:35,840
I'm gonna try to just leap in, let me see.

1313
00:50:35,840 --> 00:50:36,720
Yeah, just like leap in.

1314
00:50:36,720 --> 00:50:39,680
Come on down for Beasley Toyota.

1315
00:50:40,320 --> 00:50:44,640
I didn't inhale, but you should inhale these deals.

1316
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:47,040
Is that good?

1317
00:50:47,040 --> 00:50:48,240
I know kung fu.

1318
00:50:54,240 --> 00:50:55,520
Dude, you're getting a Dell.

1319
00:50:55,520 --> 00:51:00,480
Come on down to Roger Beasley Toyota

1320
00:51:00,480 --> 00:51:02,240
and come get yourself a Dell.

1321
00:51:03,360 --> 00:51:05,280
It's me, President Barack Obama.

1322
00:51:05,840 --> 00:51:06,880
Where is the beef?

1323
00:51:06,880 --> 00:51:08,480
It's at Bob Carlyle Toyota.

1324
00:51:13,760 --> 00:51:16,080
It's me, President Barack Hussein Obama.

1325
00:51:16,080 --> 00:51:17,520
A lot of people forget the Hussein, but it's important.

1326
00:51:18,480 --> 00:51:20,240
And pizza, pizza.

1327
00:51:21,440 --> 00:51:23,520
Come on down to my Toyota town.

1328
00:51:23,520 --> 00:51:24,800
Come on, fuck.

1329
00:51:25,520 --> 00:51:27,120
Oh, shit, you can't fucking curse.

1330
00:51:27,120 --> 00:51:27,840
No, that's three.

1331
00:51:30,160 --> 00:51:31,200
Did you guys ever...

1332
00:51:33,520 --> 00:51:35,040
Travis, you're excluded from this question

1333
00:51:35,040 --> 00:51:36,000
because we know the answer.

1334
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:40,880
Do you guys ever attempt to do an impression cold?

1335
00:51:40,880 --> 00:51:41,200
Yeah.

1336
00:51:41,200 --> 00:51:42,880
Maybe just around friends and family

1337
00:51:42,880 --> 00:51:46,000
and it comes out note perfect

1338
00:51:46,560 --> 00:51:48,320
and then you can never capture it again?

1339
00:51:48,320 --> 00:51:51,840
You can never get back into the groove of it?

1340
00:51:51,840 --> 00:51:52,160
No.

1341
00:51:52,160 --> 00:51:53,920
Why am I excluded from this?

1342
00:51:53,920 --> 00:51:54,880
Because we know you can't.

1343
00:51:55,440 --> 00:51:56,640
I heard you're Bill Clinton.

1344
00:51:56,640 --> 00:51:57,520
Yeah, I can't.

1345
00:51:57,520 --> 00:51:58,640
Okay, I can't.

1346
00:51:58,640 --> 00:52:01,760
I have no control over my voice at all

1347
00:52:01,760 --> 00:52:03,120
until it leaves my mouth.

1348
00:52:03,120 --> 00:52:04,960
And then I have to do a slow tuning in

1349
00:52:04,960 --> 00:52:07,360
that takes me about a week to get to any impression

1350
00:52:07,360 --> 00:52:08,640
and then I immediately lose it.

1351
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:12,000
Last week when I didn't even wind up,

1352
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:14,640
I just like busted into a pitch perfect Roger Klotz.

1353
00:52:14,640 --> 00:52:16,000
I didn't know that that was inside of me,

1354
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:18,240
but I just opened up my mouth and a little bird came out.

1355
00:52:18,240 --> 00:52:19,840
And then you did the impression.

1356
00:52:19,840 --> 00:52:21,360
And then I did the impression.

1357
00:52:21,360 --> 00:52:22,320
Folks, that's gonna do it for us.

1358
00:52:22,320 --> 00:52:23,920
Thank you so much for listening to our program.

1359
00:52:23,920 --> 00:52:25,840
We hope you've enjoyed your time with us.

1360
00:52:25,840 --> 00:52:28,560
Can you do an impression when you do the outro?

1361
00:52:28,560 --> 00:52:29,600
It's so boring.

1362
00:52:29,600 --> 00:52:31,040
I hate doing it every time.

1363
00:52:31,040 --> 00:52:32,160
I think it would spice it up

1364
00:52:32,160 --> 00:52:34,480
if we just did a little bit of like a fun voice.

1365
00:52:34,480 --> 00:52:35,200
Who do you want?

1366
00:52:36,080 --> 00:52:37,120
Yes, yes.

1367
00:52:37,120 --> 00:52:39,360
We will all do celebrity impersonations,

1368
00:52:39,360 --> 00:52:40,640
but I will not pick.

1369
00:52:40,640 --> 00:52:42,880
You guys have to tell me who the celebrity

1370
00:52:42,880 --> 00:52:44,160
I am to impersonate is.

1371
00:52:44,160 --> 00:52:45,280
Gwyneth Paltrow.

1372
00:52:45,280 --> 00:52:45,760
Oh, no.

1373
00:52:45,760 --> 00:52:46,720
Okay, that's ridiculous.

1374
00:52:46,720 --> 00:52:48,240
She doesn't have a specific speaking style.

1375
00:52:48,240 --> 00:52:49,520
She does too.

1376
00:52:49,520 --> 00:52:51,520
No, she's a-

1377
00:52:51,520 --> 00:52:52,720
Okay, go on Travis.

1378
00:52:52,720 --> 00:52:53,120
Wait, sorry.

1379
00:52:53,120 --> 00:52:54,080
Fuck, that was Ringo Starr.

1380
00:52:54,080 --> 00:52:54,880
You're Gwyneth Paltrow.

1381
00:52:54,880 --> 00:52:56,080
No, you're Gwyneth Paltrow now.

1382
00:52:56,800 --> 00:52:58,320
Can I be Andre the Giant?

1383
00:52:58,320 --> 00:52:58,880
Yes.

1384
00:52:58,880 --> 00:53:00,400
Yeah, you can be Andre the Giant.

1385
00:53:00,400 --> 00:53:01,360
You don't get to pick your own.

1386
00:53:01,360 --> 00:53:01,840
Who am I?

1387
00:53:02,720 --> 00:53:04,400
Why don't you be Andre the Giant?

1388
00:53:04,400 --> 00:53:06,240
Oh, sounds like what are they doing?

1389
00:53:06,240 --> 00:53:07,680
Andre the Giant.

1390
00:53:07,680 --> 00:53:11,600
Justin, I want you to do Michael Keaton.

1391
00:53:11,600 --> 00:53:14,080
These are the weirdest impression requests ever.

1392
00:53:14,720 --> 00:53:16,160
What the fuck, Travis?

1393
00:53:16,160 --> 00:53:20,800
I'll do Andrew Jackson.

1394
00:53:20,800 --> 00:53:22,240
I'll do Bob Carlisle.

1395
00:53:23,120 --> 00:53:26,160
We do have a big announcement.

1396
00:53:30,560 --> 00:53:31,200
Hello, folks.

1397
00:53:31,200 --> 00:53:32,560
This is Travis McElroy coming to you

1398
00:53:32,560 --> 00:53:33,760
with a very special announcement.

1399
00:53:35,200 --> 00:53:38,240
We are doing a candlelight show this year.

1400
00:53:38,240 --> 00:53:39,200
But wait a minute.

1401
00:53:39,200 --> 00:53:40,000
Well, wait a minute.

1402
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:43,120
We said that we wouldn't because you and I are having babies

1403
00:53:43,120 --> 00:53:44,720
like right around then.

1404
00:53:44,720 --> 00:53:45,440
Yeah, Griffin.

1405
00:53:45,440 --> 00:53:46,560
But here's the twist.

1406
00:53:46,560 --> 00:53:48,000
We're doing it in September

1407
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:50,320
because candlelight is whenever you want it to be.

1408
00:53:50,320 --> 00:53:52,000
And that's when we're all going to be in Huntington.

1409
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:53,280
So that's when we want it to be.

1410
00:53:53,280 --> 00:53:57,120
And sometimes you just feel that holiday spirit coming around

1411
00:53:58,160 --> 00:54:00,640
while you're shooting a television show for CSO.

1412
00:54:01,440 --> 00:54:02,800
And sometimes you need a special.

1413
00:54:05,520 --> 00:54:08,080
You need live footage of you doing your podcast

1414
00:54:08,080 --> 00:54:10,000
for the television show that you're making.

1415
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:12,000
Sometimes the stars just align like that.

1416
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:15,120
Yeah, sometimes you grab the stars by their stupid faces

1417
00:54:15,120 --> 00:54:16,640
and say, get in a line.

1418
00:54:16,640 --> 00:54:18,320
Get in a line, stars.

1419
00:54:18,320 --> 00:54:19,360
September 30th.

1420
00:54:20,480 --> 00:54:23,680
So we will have more details coming and ticket links

1421
00:54:23,680 --> 00:54:24,640
and all that stuff on Twitter.

1422
00:54:25,360 --> 00:54:27,360
We're trying to put the tickets on sale this week.

1423
00:54:27,360 --> 00:54:29,040
So like before the next episode goes up.

1424
00:54:29,040 --> 00:54:31,360
So we'll tweet ahead of time to let everyone know

1425
00:54:31,360 --> 00:54:32,320
when they'll be going on sale.

1426
00:54:32,320 --> 00:54:35,040
But pay attention to the NBNBM Twitter.

1427
00:54:35,040 --> 00:54:36,560
September 30th in Huntington.

1428
00:54:36,560 --> 00:54:38,160
We're going to be doing a candlelight special

1429
00:54:39,120 --> 00:54:41,440
with Sawbones and maybe Schmaners.

1430
00:54:41,440 --> 00:54:43,680
And we will be filming parts of it

1431
00:54:43,680 --> 00:54:45,440
and putting it on the CSO show.

1432
00:54:45,440 --> 00:54:47,840
We know this is coming in hot.

1433
00:54:49,200 --> 00:54:52,400
It really isn't like we think it's going to be a lot of fun.

1434
00:54:52,400 --> 00:54:56,000
Otherwise, we can't do any more live shows this year

1435
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:57,040
after this basically.

1436
00:54:58,400 --> 00:55:00,800
So this is like our last chance to do this thing.

1437
00:55:00,800 --> 00:55:01,760
And it's coming in kind of hot.

1438
00:55:01,760 --> 00:55:03,600
But it's because this idea was,

1439
00:55:04,480 --> 00:55:06,080
it popped up only very recently.

1440
00:55:06,080 --> 00:55:08,160
So candlelights in September.

1441
00:55:08,160 --> 00:55:09,680
September 30th in Huntington.

1442
00:55:09,680 --> 00:55:11,360
More details to come probably this week.

1443
00:55:11,360 --> 00:55:13,200
Watch our Twitter at NBNBAM.

1444
00:55:13,200 --> 00:55:16,880
This isn't specifically related to this show.

1445
00:55:16,880 --> 00:55:18,160
But we make another show.

1446
00:55:18,160 --> 00:55:19,200
It's called The Adventure Zone.

1447
00:55:19,200 --> 00:55:21,120
It's a D&D podcast we make with our dad.

1448
00:55:21,920 --> 00:55:25,360
And a bunch of folks who listen to that show

1449
00:55:25,360 --> 00:55:28,480
led by Megan Raley and with help from Carrie Peach

1450
00:55:29,440 --> 00:55:32,320
have made a project called The Adventure Zine

1451
00:55:32,320 --> 00:55:34,320
where it's a collection of fan art.

1452
00:55:34,880 --> 00:55:39,040
And all the profits from this fan art book

1453
00:55:39,040 --> 00:55:41,200
are going to go to Facing Hunger.

1454
00:55:41,200 --> 00:55:44,400
Which is a Huntington-based food bank.

1455
00:55:45,200 --> 00:55:46,960
And it's a really cool project.

1456
00:55:46,960 --> 00:55:49,280
And they have raised a ton of money already.

1457
00:55:49,280 --> 00:55:51,840
But you will definitely want to get a copy of this.

1458
00:55:51,840 --> 00:55:52,480
Yeah, I know.

1459
00:55:52,480 --> 00:55:55,040
It's out of control.

1460
00:55:55,040 --> 00:56:00,320
Theadventurezine.com is the address to go

1461
00:56:00,320 --> 00:56:01,760
if you want to get a copy.

1462
00:56:01,760 --> 00:56:04,800
And this isn't like a book that's going to be widely made

1463
00:56:04,800 --> 00:56:05,920
and then sold in stores and stuff.

1464
00:56:05,920 --> 00:56:06,800
This is how you get it.

1465
00:56:06,800 --> 00:56:12,480
So you'll want to head over to theadventurezine.com

1466
00:56:13,360 --> 00:56:16,800
and pre-order your copy right away.

1467
00:56:16,800 --> 00:56:18,320
So get on board with that.

1468
00:56:18,320 --> 00:56:19,760
If you've already done that, thank you so much

1469
00:56:20,400 --> 00:56:23,360
from us and from everybody in this area.

1470
00:56:23,360 --> 00:56:24,400
We really appreciate your help.

1471
00:56:25,040 --> 00:56:27,600
I also want to say because we forgot to mention it

1472
00:56:27,600 --> 00:56:28,320
on the last one.

1473
00:56:30,320 --> 00:56:31,840
So we did smart stuff.

1474
00:56:31,840 --> 00:56:37,520
The Justin and we did it with Justin and Roman Mars.

1475
00:56:37,520 --> 00:56:38,560
And that was a joke.

1476
00:56:38,560 --> 00:56:44,640
Well, on episode 225 of 99% Invisible,

1477
00:56:44,640 --> 00:56:46,640
Roman Mars took it and he ran with it

1478
00:56:46,640 --> 00:56:50,400
and he made it funnier than I could ever possibly imagine.

1479
00:56:50,400 --> 00:56:53,280
And it was wonderfully flattering that he did that.

1480
00:56:53,280 --> 00:56:54,320
And it's so cool.

1481
00:56:55,280 --> 00:56:55,920
Go check it out.

1482
00:56:55,920 --> 00:56:57,760
And if you haven't listened to 99% Invisible,

1483
00:56:58,320 --> 00:56:59,520
what the fuck is wrong with you?

1484
00:56:59,520 --> 00:57:00,320
It's so good.

1485
00:57:00,320 --> 00:57:01,760
All right, let's run down some stuff.

1486
00:57:01,760 --> 00:57:03,840
Uh, thanks to Maximum Fun for having us.

1487
00:57:03,840 --> 00:57:06,000
It's a podcast network we're really proud to be a part of.

1488
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:07,120
Go to MaximumFun.org.

1489
00:57:07,120 --> 00:57:08,320
You can find a ton of podcasts there

1490
00:57:08,320 --> 00:57:09,600
that you will absolutely love,

1491
00:57:09,600 --> 00:57:12,800
like The Flophouse and Throwing Shade

1492
00:57:12,800 --> 00:57:14,720
and Jordan Jesse Goh and Judge John Hodgman,

1493
00:57:14,720 --> 00:57:16,640
all of them at MaximumFun.org.

1494
00:57:16,640 --> 00:57:19,120
We're going to be at MaxFunCon East next weekend.

1495
00:57:19,120 --> 00:57:21,520
And hopefully we'll see all y'all there.

1496
00:57:21,520 --> 00:57:23,440
We're doing a live adventure zone while we're there

1497
00:57:24,640 --> 00:57:25,600
that I'm excited for.

1498
00:57:27,040 --> 00:57:27,600
Lots of surprises.

1499
00:57:27,600 --> 00:57:30,000
I just got a bunch of new costume pieces for it.

1500
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:30,560
Oh boy.

1501
00:57:30,560 --> 00:57:31,680
Yeah.

1502
00:57:31,680 --> 00:57:33,360
And I got like a real-ass shield.

1503
00:57:33,360 --> 00:57:33,760
Nice.

1504
00:57:33,760 --> 00:57:35,680
So we do other podcasts that you can listen to

1505
00:57:35,680 --> 00:57:37,040
at McElroyShows.com.

1506
00:57:38,160 --> 00:57:39,440
I won't go through the list of them,

1507
00:57:39,440 --> 00:57:40,480
but we do a ton.

1508
00:57:40,480 --> 00:57:41,840
And if you like this show,

1509
00:57:41,840 --> 00:57:44,000
then you're going to love one of the other ones we do,

1510
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:45,120
I guarantee it.

1511
00:57:45,120 --> 00:57:46,720
Thanks to John Roderick and the Long Winters

1512
00:57:46,720 --> 00:57:47,600
for the use of our theme song.

1513
00:57:47,600 --> 00:57:48,640
It's a departure off the album,

1514
00:57:48,640 --> 00:57:49,520
Putting the Days to Bed,

1515
00:57:49,520 --> 00:57:51,120
which you should absolutely go listen to.

1516
00:57:51,760 --> 00:57:52,800
And then after listening to that,

1517
00:57:52,800 --> 00:57:53,920
you're going to want to go

1518
00:57:53,920 --> 00:57:57,440
and point your iTunes browser

1519
00:57:57,440 --> 00:58:01,600
towards the emotion b-sides from my leash,

1520
00:58:01,600 --> 00:58:02,560
Carly Rae Jepsen,

1521
00:58:03,600 --> 00:58:06,400
and just sort of emerge yourself

1522
00:58:06,400 --> 00:58:08,320
in a sensory deprivation chamber

1523
00:58:08,320 --> 00:58:11,040
that somehow does allow the sense of sound

1524
00:58:11,040 --> 00:58:11,920
and just-

1525
00:58:12,480 --> 00:58:13,040
And love.

1526
00:58:13,040 --> 00:58:13,760
The sense of love.

1527
00:58:13,760 --> 00:58:14,560
And taste, strangely.

1528
00:58:14,560 --> 00:58:16,960
Just fucking let it go.

1529
00:58:18,080 --> 00:58:21,440
Just let it all go in that Jepsen tank.

1530
00:58:22,800 --> 00:58:24,160
If you're looking for one track,

1531
00:58:24,160 --> 00:58:25,280
might I suggest Store.

1532
00:58:25,280 --> 00:58:26,720
Oh, Store, guys.

1533
00:58:26,720 --> 00:58:27,760
Store.

1534
00:58:27,760 --> 00:58:28,800
But Store.

1535
00:58:28,800 --> 00:58:30,800
But that Store, though.

1536
00:58:32,720 --> 00:58:33,440
You want that final?

1537
00:58:34,080 --> 00:58:34,400
Hit me.

1538
00:58:34,400 --> 00:58:34,720
Yep.

1539
00:58:34,720 --> 00:58:35,600
Here come that final.

1540
00:58:36,800 --> 00:58:38,400
This one was sent in by Michael Knoll.

1541
00:58:38,400 --> 00:58:38,960
Thank you.

1542
00:58:38,960 --> 00:58:41,840
It was asked by Yahoo Answers user Gabriel M,

1543
00:58:41,840 --> 00:58:42,640
who asks,

1544
00:58:44,480 --> 00:58:47,120
did Happy Gilmore continue professional golfing

1545
00:58:47,120 --> 00:58:48,400
after the movie ended?

1546
00:58:51,200 --> 00:58:51,920
Oh, no.

1547
00:58:52,560 --> 00:58:53,920
My name is Justin McElroy.

1548
00:58:53,920 --> 00:58:55,120
I'm Travis McElroy.

1549
00:58:55,120 --> 00:58:56,320
I'm Griffin McElroy.

1550
00:58:56,320 --> 00:58:57,600
This has been My Brother, My Brother and Me.

1551
00:58:57,600 --> 00:58:58,640
Kiss your dad.

1552
00:58:58,640 --> 00:58:59,680
Square on the lips.

1561
00:59:33,520 --> 00:59:36,400
May we recommend The Flophouse?

1562
00:59:36,400 --> 00:59:38,560
Three friends talk about bad movies

1563
00:59:38,560 --> 00:59:41,120
and make each other and you laugh.

1564
00:59:41,120 --> 00:59:42,640
Rated R.

1565
00:59:42,640 --> 00:59:46,960

You don't need to do that.

1571
00:59:59,600 --> 01:00:00,480
Just download it.

1572
01:00:01,520 --> 01:00:02,560
