1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,820
The McElroy brothers are not experts and their advice should never be followed

2
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:10,580
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it

3
00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:17,660
Also, this show isn't for kids which I mentioned only so the babies out there will know how cool they are for listening

4
00:00:17,660 --> 00:00:30,660
What's up, you cool, baby?

5
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:50,160
It's better, it's better with you

6
00:00:53,980 --> 00:00:55,980
It's better, it's better with you

7
00:01:00,220 --> 00:01:02,220
It's better, it's better with you

8
00:01:10,660 --> 00:01:16,100
Hello everybody and welcome to my brother, my brother, and me in an advice show for the modern era

9
00:01:16,100 --> 00:01:18,580
I'm your oldest brother Justin McElroy

10
00:01:18,780 --> 00:01:24,500
And I'm your middle-est brother big dog woof woof Travis woof woof McElroy woof woof

11
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:27,260
And this is and this is Griffin

12
00:01:28,340 --> 00:01:33,760
I'm sorry guys. Whoa. Are we just gonna pretend like what happened?

13
00:01:34,660 --> 00:01:37,700
Didn't happen. What in what way Griff? What do you mean?

14
00:01:37,700 --> 00:01:46,340
I'd so we really are doing this then pretending like it didn't happen. What are you talking about though folks?

15
00:01:47,180 --> 00:01:51,120
Moments before we started recording Justin Justin said

16
00:01:52,020 --> 00:01:57,340
Justin said to shut up. He said shut up. I was trying to I was complimenting Griffin on a new wallpaper

17
00:01:58,140 --> 00:02:00,340
Wow, I have a new wallpaper and

18
00:02:00,340 --> 00:02:08,000
And Travis was paying me. What was maybe the first compliment. He's ever given anyone uh-huh and

19
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:13,760
Well, I give compliments, but they're usually like you have a great brother named Travis shut up Travis shut up for a second

20
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:17,040
Oh, just fuck shit. Travis. Justin was like shut up

21
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:19,960
hmm, and it's like

22
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:26,480
It sucked like it sucked it and put us such a steep. Hey Griffin. Can I talk to Justin for just a second?

23
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:29,660
I don't remember this. Hey Griffin, could you step over there?

24
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:34,240
I guess so. Thank you. Hey Justin

25
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:34,800
Yeah

26
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:38,420
I was ready to team up with Griffin against you because you said shut up to me

27
00:02:38,420 --> 00:02:41,760
But then Griffin just said shut up to me and it's a much fresher. Was that directed at you?

28
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:46,480
I actually did not get that sense. Yeah, it was directed at me. So if you if I could just step in here

29
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:51,840
No, hey, shut up. I'll talk you and me. I thought we were saying shut up. I didn't I know

30
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:57,640
Um, but that one didn't count that one did not count you and me could team up against Griffin if you want

31
00:02:57,640 --> 00:03:01,980
Oh, that's cool. Yeah, I love that. Yeah. Okay. Well, okay. Hey Griffin, you can come back over

32
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:05,780
Do do do do do do. Oh fuck. Why'd I walk so far away? Hold on guys

33
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:08,880
Almost there. Okay

34
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:11,120
Almost there. Whoa, too close

35
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:18,960
I'll back up and I'm back. What's up guys? Hey, fuck you. No Trav. I don't think so bud. No, that wasn't it

36
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:24,000
It's not that's actually what you put a little bit too much sauce on it and just if can you actually

37
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:30,680
Step out. Yeah, I'll step out of the room. No, I'm sorry. I want Travis to step out. I need you Justin. I need you

38
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:33,200
Yeah, sorry

39
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:37,240
Just go out on the credenza. You go on the credenza. We'll go on the veranda

40
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:42,400
Okay, which I actually don't know if a credenza is something you can go. No, it's like a chest or drawers

41
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:46,280
I'm gonna stand on top of it. All right, you stand on top of that chest of drawers. It's really tall though

42
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:51,460
I can't hear you. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Okay, did you stand on there now do a fucking flip? Okay

43
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:54,400
Yeah, baby. Oh cool

44
00:03:56,040 --> 00:04:02,480
Yeah, I've been better than our usual thing why don't we never do stunts that's a good Griffin you do is hey

45
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:06,040
Could you um, oh, you know what? Can you jump from the couch?

46
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:11,320
To that big box TV we have and on to the recliner. Um, yeah, hold on

47
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:14,320
Yeah

48
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:16,320
Yeah

49
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:21,560
That was the sound of me doing it I like the part where you bounced off the ceiling like nightcrawler

50
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:25,440
Thanks. And now Justin eat this whole bicycle. I

51
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:33,240
Don't tire spokes and all baby pedals that whole kitten caboodle. I'd rather not do that. I'm sorry. Okay

52
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:36,860
Well, you're out. Okay. Is that okay? No, yes, so

53
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:39,520
paid for a stunt spectacular

54
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:44,720
Yeah, I did the thing where I ramped my jet ski through the big ring of fire

55
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:50,840
Griffin fought that shark and now you need to eat this bicycle. You can eat the bicycle. I'll give you a choice Justin

56
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:55,440
Okay, eat you can eat the bicycle or catch or catch this bullet

57
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:58,800
Hmm

58
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:06,200
Catch the bullet how it went with what body part my stomach do you want me to throw it underhand or overhand?

59
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:08,760
Oh, well if I'm catching it

60
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:14,800
Overhand yeah, but not too hard Travis. It is still a bullet. Yeah

61
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:21,920
I actually got so uncomfortable now that we brought bullets into it. Oh, no, it's just like a nerf. Yeah a nerf dart

62
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:28,160
We're just having fun in the living room. And I don't even know where one gets a bullet. Yeah, right

63
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:32,220
It's like a bullet store who's even heard of that? I mean clearly there's a bullet store

64
00:05:32,220 --> 00:05:34,880
But do you walk in and do you are you like let me get um?

65
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:36,960
five

66
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:41,800
Five bullets. Is that tell me what kind of bullets I don't know

67
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:47,080
They they love it at the gun store when you walk in you're like, what's a good number of bullets for a beginner?

68
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:53,200
Yeah, what's a starter bullet? Like I don't want like don't give me a complicated bullet with a bunch of moving parts

69
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:57,600
Just give me like a bullet that I can plant in the ground and a gun will grow from you know

70
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:01,520
And what kind of good are you working with son a nor like a normal size?

71
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:06,000
Mm-hmm normal size gun. It's kind of like gray, but also kind of black

72
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:11,400
Give me that. Give me the succulent of bullets, please just something real easy

73
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:15,440
I want to say it's a club from gold night, but that's probably anything

74
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:18,080
Right, it's gold

75
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:24,120
It's a golden gun. I cannot think of a store where I would be more out of my element

76
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:32,720
Oh asking for things then gun store. Oh, yeah, which is good because I don't need to do that, right? Like I have a demonstration plan

77
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:38,120
What of your guns can best hold a daisy that I'll slip into the barrel. Oh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I love that

78
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:42,120
I um, I cannot imagine

79
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:45,560
the the only thing you know when like you

80
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:50,320
Order a fancy bottle of wine because you're trying to feel like a fancy person and then they pour a little bit in a glass

81
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:52,860
And you're supposed to smell it and you're like, I don't know what the fuck this is

82
00:06:52,860 --> 00:06:59,820
yeah, I would worry about the moment when I was at a gun store and I said like I'll try that gun please and they

83
00:06:59,820 --> 00:07:05,980
Handed it to me and it would go in my hand and I would think what am I supposed to be checking for like?

84
00:07:05,980 --> 00:07:07,740
Yeah, that's a gun

85
00:07:07,740 --> 00:07:08,820
Yeah

86
00:07:08,820 --> 00:07:11,780
Yeah, yeah, I just throw that for sure

87
00:07:13,060 --> 00:07:20,620
Well, this is this one went this one has been a good intro I think yeah. Yeah. Yeah, man

88
00:07:20,620 --> 00:07:22,500
Oh

89
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:24,500
What's wrong juice just all this?

90
00:07:27,460 --> 00:07:31,420
What I'm fine, sorry, I couldn't find the email and I found the email

91
00:07:31,420 --> 00:07:36,860
Oh, I didn't want to derail everything cuz it's like there is a limited number of things you guys can do

92
00:07:36,860 --> 00:07:39,100
I just don't know is this you didn't want to derail it

93
00:07:39,100 --> 00:07:47,260
So you mained maybe one of the worst human noises I've ever heard. I was second-guessing the introduction. It's very visual

94
00:07:47,260 --> 00:07:51,700
Oh, you know, I didn't I didn't even think about that for a podcast

95
00:07:52,540 --> 00:07:56,580
recording for cuz you know, we did the live show it was a smashing success and

96
00:07:58,100 --> 00:08:00,100
But it had a lot of visual elements

97
00:08:00,780 --> 00:08:03,780
Maybe gotten the habit of including visual elements

98
00:08:04,060 --> 00:08:05,060
Yeah, you know

99
00:08:05,060 --> 00:08:11,860
We'll just put the video up for it because I you guys have been like recording your video every time we do a podcast, right?

100
00:08:13,020 --> 00:08:14,700
I've been

101
00:08:14,700 --> 00:08:18,260
Recording a screen share your guys's video. Oh

102
00:08:18,820 --> 00:08:24,240
My god, this is so awkward Griffin. I've been recording a screen share of your guys's video. Whoa

103
00:08:24,260 --> 00:08:27,400
Okay, so that explains the sort of Tesseract

104
00:08:27,620 --> 00:08:33,420
Yeah that we created inside of my Windows operating system and why clip and why Clippy died?

105
00:08:34,020 --> 00:08:39,340
Yeah, man. I miss Clippy funeral for a friend. I miss him so much. Remember when planners killed mr

106
00:08:39,340 --> 00:08:43,540
Peanut they could do that for Clippy and there'd be much rejoicing. I think everybody be excited about that

107
00:08:43,540 --> 00:08:49,420
You bring him in. Well, no, they would never bring him back. That's the thing. He died stay dead. I like mr

108
00:08:49,420 --> 00:08:50,460
They learned their lesson with mr

109
00:08:50,460 --> 00:08:54,540
Peanut when they were like and now he's a baby peanut and now he's back to being normal again. It's like oh

110
00:08:55,100 --> 00:09:00,300
Yeah, this is a trick. The whole thing was a trick get this guys. It was advertising

111
00:09:00,660 --> 00:09:05,180
Yeah, we're just pretending the nuts are still the nuts this time. They'll be like Clippy got very

112
00:09:05,820 --> 00:09:11,220
Clippy got sick and he passed away and he will not be a baby this time. Thank you for watching

113
00:09:11,220 --> 00:09:16,980
Because that's not at company how paperclips work if you want you can kind of bend them into a triangle

114
00:09:17,740 --> 00:09:21,860
And if you arrange it correctly, you know kind of pop up when you drop it on the table

115
00:09:22,300 --> 00:09:30,120
And you want to do that with Clippy's corpse and you can pretend like that's a that's his body still alive and moving around

116
00:09:30,260 --> 00:09:35,140
Crankin doing I mean, that's the good news. Even when Clippy dies. He could still effectively work as a paperclip

117
00:09:35,140 --> 00:09:37,140
Yeah, you can still hold paperclips. Yeah, he doesn't die

118
00:09:37,140 --> 00:09:43,580
He just becomes a less sentient paperclip a better paperclip if you want. He doesn't teach you about headers and footers

119
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:46,100
but

120
00:09:46,340 --> 00:09:53,180
Documents, yeah. Yeah, yeah for sure. I mean not like a staple a staples way better. I think we all agree

121
00:09:53,420 --> 00:09:58,740
This is the worst introduction we've ever done in the 580. I think we can all agree

122
00:09:59,540 --> 00:10:04,640
Anyone who has not already bought into the franchise in a pretty major way at this point has yeah

123
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:10,760
Well, every 580 episodes you got to reset back to zero and build up again. We're below that

124
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:16,840
No, well, we've been we've been absolutely crushing the intros lately. I think is the feedback we always get

125
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:25,280
So I I think that it's nice for us to just remind people that like what the low at low point looks like

126
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:30,480
The nadir if you will, and I'm not sure if I've ever said that word correctly

127
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:37,560
Nadir is the good one, right? Well Zenith is the good Zenith is the good one nadir is the worst one

128
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:39,980
Yeah, agree to disagree

129
00:10:39,980 --> 00:10:42,440
We've done a lot this show several times this week

130
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:51,920
We did the show several times in the past week because of scheduling conflicts that are let's be honest our own fault

131
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:58,920
Yeah, and now we have we have arrived at this point where you were hearing this and we're recording it

132
00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:02,280
And that's all that's promised or intended

133
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:05,000
This is an advice show

134
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:11,560
Here's my first piece of advice. If you're doing a comedy podcast, especially during a pandemic where you're maybe

135
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:18,920
Mental state has been not great as a result of the ongoing unpleasantness. Don't try to do three comedy podcasts in or in one week

136
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:25,160
Yeah, never recover not to mention several other podcasts several other podcasts now

137
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:27,640
We are sometimes we try to do funny skits

138
00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:29,040
like

139
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:34,720
Adventure Zone Adventure Zone is like skit after skit after sketch after skit after sketch

140
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:39,240
I have a friend who loves Godzilla then why don't they marry him?

141
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:41,960
Yeah, why don't you marry Godzilla?

142
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:48,240
I found this great video of the fight between Godzilla and King Kong from Godzilla vs. King Kong. Fuck

143
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:55,640
Yes, sorry from Godzilla vs. Kong. Yeah, let's let's be specific with our words. I need a hero from Shrek 2. Hell, yeah

144
00:11:55,640 --> 00:11:57,640
Oh wait, is that a special version?

145
00:11:58,540 --> 00:12:00,540
Yeah, wait a minute

146
00:12:01,300 --> 00:12:08,700
Do you think that I need a hero as part of the score of the orchestration of Shrek 2? Okay, wait

147
00:12:08,700 --> 00:12:10,700
No, what? Okay

148
00:12:11,020 --> 00:12:12,380
What?

149
00:12:12,380 --> 00:12:14,380
Who wrote All Star?

150
00:12:15,060 --> 00:12:17,060
Smash that mouth. Oh

151
00:12:17,060 --> 00:12:24,280
Yeah, no, okay to be fair, okay in Shrek

152
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:30,800
It is sung by the fairy godmother character. So it is a different person singing in for Saunders

153
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:33,560
Yeah, so if you specifically use that version

154
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:38,060
Then I understand what you're saying. Okay. Okay. I got I am with you now

155
00:12:38,060 --> 00:12:43,160
Oh PS if I could just take a quick shark related diversion. Yeah, I went over to pick up my daughter

156
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:47,800
You do not have to ask permission. I don't need permission. I went over to pick up my daughter from

157
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:50,440
Mimi's house and Mimi said

158
00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:53,160
Cooper tell that Cooper's our three-year-old

159
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:59,320
Mimi said Cooper tell daddy what movie you've been watching today on repeat and she looks me dead in the eyes and goes

160
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:01,960
some poppy one

161
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
Robo be

162
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:09,160
Ain't that sharp is to be a bushy. Oh

163
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:11,160
Oh

164
00:13:12,280 --> 00:13:14,280
It's on

165
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:20,960
Okay, so I was reading the question. Oh, yeah, the problem is this friend has can't say one other thing real quick

166
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:25,160
Can call whipped a

167
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:31,440
Scene from Shrek to whips ass. Yeah, but I want to talk about my thing first. That's that movie whips ass

168
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:34,480
It's so good. These two big boys are awesome

169
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:40,040
Individually, oh you get them together you put them together and they cannot I thought

170
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:44,960
Godzilla was a lady cuz Matthew Broderick said she was having babies. That's

171
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:47,520
non-canonical

172
00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:48,920
non-canonical

173
00:13:48,920 --> 00:13:50,800
the problem is

174
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:52,800
Can I talk about the Matthew Broderick?

175
00:13:54,280 --> 00:14:01,280
What's up with that Roland Emmerich produced 2000 Godzilla featuring a soundtrack full of absolute bangers smashers

176
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:04,480
But I just don't understand Godzilla fit in Madison Square Garden

177
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:06,920
without

178
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:13,600
Okay, sorry. Okay. Okay, Travis, please. Let's try to focus. Okay, right, right. You got Ben folds five

179
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:18,020
Yeah doing air. Yeah, if you ever heard that one. Yeah, there's a

180
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:21,040
fucking there's that great version of

181
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:24,240
Kashmir ride with me. Oh, yeah

182
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:31,520
Oh my god, I believe that's Sean puffy combs. Oh, yeah, and obviously the wallflowers are in this one

183
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:33,520
Yeah, sure. Sure. Sure, you know what I mean?

184
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:40,760
Man puff daddy's track is good. Yeah, come with me. That was my first exposure to cashmere

185
00:14:40,760 --> 00:14:46,160
And when I heard cashmere, it's like dang you guys were above that in a major way a huge way

186
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:52,320
All right, so we're okay now and Hank's areas in a what's the wallflowers? It's the hero

187
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:54,200
It's just a cover of heroes, isn't it?

188
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:57,240
All right, most of our audience was not alive when this foot came out

189
00:14:57,240 --> 00:15:00,860
so let's go you remember the huge Taco Bell tie-in with that to or the

190
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:06,200
Chihuahua like talk to Godzilla and like a scene in a commercial

191
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:10,920
The problem is that this friend has the same name as my no-nonsense landlord

192
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:15,500
And when I went to send this amazing video to my friend, I accidentally

193
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:23,980
Yo, hey, thanks for let me live here you ever sees big boys

194
00:15:25,020 --> 00:15:31,180
Frank Frank Frank Frank Frank check out this video. You know that right? You know my landlord Frank Maraschino

195
00:15:31,980 --> 00:15:35,740
Who is somehow I don't know how you know two people named Frank Maraschino

196
00:15:35,740 --> 00:15:39,020
That seems wild to me, but check out these two big boys

197
00:15:39,580 --> 00:15:43,820
And I know what you're thinking. Oh, this is great. Now when I mute the video, that's right

198
00:15:43,820 --> 00:15:48,620
It's I need a hero from Shrek to not the original version of I need a hero

199
00:15:49,220 --> 00:15:53,900
Why yes, it is. I thought you loved this. Can I get a discount on next month?

200
00:15:55,140 --> 00:15:58,580
Next month is free. You showed me this big lizard fight this huge

201
00:16:00,300 --> 00:16:04,680
You live here for free now, you're my you're my child now

202
00:16:06,580 --> 00:16:12,380
You need me I understand the message I want to finish the question. All right. Yeah, that'd be dope

203
00:16:12,380 --> 00:16:19,000
We've been reading it for like 10 minutes. I accidentally sent to my landlord who is on vacation in Greece even better

204
00:16:19,140 --> 00:16:21,140
That's where God is from

205
00:16:21,420 --> 00:16:23,420
310 in the morning

206
00:16:26,140 --> 00:16:32,020
It's been three days and I've only received the read receipt so I know he saw it my question brothers is

207
00:16:32,460 --> 00:16:36,340
What do I do when my landlord comes home and inevitably asked me about this video next time?

208
00:16:36,340 --> 00:16:42,720
I see him that's from needing a hero in Georgia. You just say pretty good, huh? I

209
00:16:46,180 --> 00:16:52,260
Mean okay, I think you just look at straight in the eyes and there's three reactions like so what do you think?

210
00:16:52,260 --> 00:16:58,660
Yeah, put it back in their court and they say pretty cool. Like yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I thought you'd like it pretty bad

211
00:16:58,660 --> 00:17:00,660
Oh, you must not have watched it

212
00:17:00,660 --> 00:17:05,100
Watch it together the time of their lives. Did you watch the whole thing?

213
00:17:05,100 --> 00:17:08,660
Cuz there's twists and turns or I think the most likely thing is very

214
00:17:10,460 --> 00:17:14,300
Grease on vacation for three weeks of one

215
00:17:14,460 --> 00:17:20,060
maybe they don't have maybe they didn't spend the dosh to get like fat pipes and they don't want to

216
00:17:20,660 --> 00:17:26,100
Maybe a series of glossy jpegs that formed together to make a great fight see with the track music

217
00:17:26,100 --> 00:17:31,660
Maybe they don't want to spend their their their gigs their giggle bites to download that

218
00:17:31,660 --> 00:17:33,060
So there's a chance they haven't watched it

219
00:17:33,060 --> 00:17:37,580
But even if they did start booting it up if I see that I'm like listen

220
00:17:37,580 --> 00:17:41,500
This is great, but I really need to be at home to enjoy it. Yeah. Yeah

221
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:43,500
Oh, I need to get in my comfy slippers

222
00:17:44,100 --> 00:17:48,740
Maybe just respond like respond to your own email and say like hey

223
00:17:48,740 --> 00:17:54,860
It's been three days and you still haven't addressed my concerns double down and and when it's like your concerns like yeah

224
00:17:54,860 --> 00:17:56,860
This is a real issue. I'm facing in my apartment

225
00:17:57,660 --> 00:18:03,660
Yeah, I just wanted to say that the reason I sent this to you and the text got cut off. So sorry, but

226
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:09,860
You in this video. I said you are Kong and my complaints about

227
00:18:10,420 --> 00:18:13,180
Property or Godzilla and every time you're out there

228
00:18:13,740 --> 00:18:15,980
Crushing my complaints and doing battle against it

229
00:18:15,980 --> 00:18:21,540
You're really keeping me satisfied as a tenant and I'm sorry that that text got cut off because without that context is probably very

230
00:18:21,540 --> 00:18:28,380
It probably completely out of nowhere. Sorry about this hero that Shrek required and I thank you for that

231
00:18:28,380 --> 00:18:33,120
You're not the hero. I deserve but you're the hero I need and I can't remember how that quote goes

232
00:18:33,380 --> 00:18:35,820
But thank you so much. How's Greece?

233
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:41,140
We don't we never talk about personal stuff have you noticed that hey

234
00:18:41,140 --> 00:19:03,500
I hope you have a good time in Greece. Did you have you found out who put the bop in the bop shabop shabop. Now Justin. That's different. Are you proud of yourself. Here's the thing I am. I am. I'm proud of you too. When I thought when I was saying it I thought this is gonna kill. Yeah.

235
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:11,920
Oh yeah from downtown. Hoop slams another one. He sounds like another word.

236
00:19:14,620 --> 00:19:15,740
Swish

237
00:19:15,740 --> 00:19:22,820
Nothing, but net with rhymes with yet. Which is what we're not done yet. There's so much more comedy to come folks

238
00:19:22,820 --> 00:19:24,820
I know stick around after these vestiges

239
00:19:25,580 --> 00:19:27,580
fucking careening case

240
00:19:27,580 --> 00:19:33,940
For for an entire other 41 minutes. Well friends we're gonna do it and die trying

241
00:19:34,860 --> 00:19:36,340
so

242
00:19:36,340 --> 00:19:38,340
Can we approach the Wizards?

243
00:19:38,420 --> 00:19:45,060
Yeah, I always say throne the wizard would not sit in a throne wizard would sit at the side of the throne

244
00:19:46,140 --> 00:19:48,420
Well, I think maybe hover

245
00:19:49,740 --> 00:19:54,700
Maybe I see so the king sitting on the throne and everybody approaches the king is like my lord

246
00:19:54,700 --> 00:20:02,380
Oh crops, but the king the whole time is like not listening because he's got this wizard hovering like six feet off the ground

247
00:20:02,540 --> 00:20:05,240
Above him. Yeah, and he's like wizard

248
00:20:05,940 --> 00:20:11,060
You're really up staging me a little like I'm the king and I can see right up your robe

249
00:20:11,060 --> 00:20:14,140
Do you I see your dingus and everything?

250
00:20:14,140 --> 00:20:19,780
It's weird that kings would always have a wizard of the court around cuz yeah me

251
00:20:19,780 --> 00:20:25,380
That's the first person I would try to eliminate. Oh really to challenge my power

252
00:20:25,940 --> 00:20:30,300
What like no, no wizard. Look at Cedric right at in Sophia the first

253
00:20:30,580 --> 00:20:37,700
Yes, the the wizard and Sophia the first spins like half that show trying to steal the amulet available now. Hold on Justin

254
00:20:37,700 --> 00:20:41,620
That's only because he thinks that's what he's supposed to do because his mother is an evil wizard

255
00:20:41,780 --> 00:20:44,540
But his father is a good wizard. I'm saying he turns it around

256
00:20:44,540 --> 00:20:48,540
I know Cedric turns it around but like but he doesn't really want it Justin like that's

257
00:20:48,540 --> 00:20:50,540
Uh, he does want it

258
00:20:50,700 --> 00:20:52,880
That's you're talking about an absolute retcon

259
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:59,580
They realize when they realize like it's wild to have like an insurgent wizard that lives in Sophia's house and is trying to destroy her

260
00:20:59,580 --> 00:21:03,220
They're like, this is a weird feel for a dizzy. He's a grown-ass adult, right?

261
00:21:03,220 --> 00:21:08,060
Yeah, this is a grown adult trying to steal a necklace from a kid. Maybe we should like rethink anyway

262
00:21:08,820 --> 00:21:14,700
You're about to purchase a wizard. Yeah, we need to hey whenever you guys are done. I'm still here

263
00:21:14,700 --> 00:21:20,300
Um, sure. Okay. So, um, this is Stevie sent this in. Thank you so much Stevie. It's

264
00:21:20,980 --> 00:21:24,780
It's written by wikiHow staff. It's under fun activities

265
00:21:26,100 --> 00:21:31,360
Boredom busters. Oh good. Which I have not clicked into that subcategory, but I imagine is a

266
00:21:32,180 --> 00:21:35,840
Vain of content for this show. So I'm gonna bookmark that real quick

267
00:21:36,300 --> 00:21:39,200
How to eat six saltine crackers in one minute

268
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:45,580
For a fan of crackers eating six saltines might sound like a simple task. However, the saltine challenge is harder than you might think

269
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:47,540
Yeah, we've all been there

270
00:21:47,540 --> 00:21:54,480
The rules are that a person must completely finish chewing and swallowing six salted saltine crackers in one minute to help without help from liquids

271
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:56,160
or lubrication

272
00:21:56,160 --> 00:22:02,480
Hey, why did you have to say both of those? Well, could you put some petroleum jelly on the crackers? I

273
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:06,180
Guess so help them slide down your gullet

274
00:22:06,180 --> 00:22:10,580
If you want to impress your friends or participate in a saltine challenge contest

275
00:22:10,580 --> 00:22:14,540
You may be able to accomplish the task with a little strategy. So we're gonna talk a

276
00:22:15,300 --> 00:22:22,100
Cracker eating strategy. I don't know how I feel about this game fax on the cracker channel. I like if you win this

277
00:22:22,700 --> 00:22:29,960
Based off of knowledge you learned on wikiHow that doesn't feel I don't know it's sporting. Yes. Yes

278
00:22:29,960 --> 00:22:37,560
That's dirty pool. Yeah, I've got cheat codes here. Here's the first cheat code for this to eat six saltines in one minute challenge and

279
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:41,760
the first one could also be the first step in

280
00:22:42,280 --> 00:22:48,200
Virtually every wikiHow article and it is simply believe in yourself. Hell, yeah

281
00:22:48,680 --> 00:22:54,800
Watch videos of people successfully eating six saltines in under a minute watching videos. Is that does that sound?

282
00:22:55,640 --> 00:22:58,360
That doesn't sound like a lot of saltines does it?

283
00:22:58,360 --> 00:22:59,520
Uh

284
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:02,880
We just don't use saltines on hands. Well, hold on. No, no, no

285
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:09,240
We're standing actually at the mouth of a cave and that cave is there's a sign hanging over it

286
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:12,800
That says the worst audio in the history of our podcast

287
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:19,120
And we can we can turn it's a tick tock later Justin. It's a tick tock later

288
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:23,560
That's a tick tock for Justin the supplementary. I want to do that as it takes hot

289
00:23:23,560 --> 00:23:27,480
I don't want to do that permanently just seems like it's not all I'm just I'm not

290
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:30,120
I'm not in a mood to eat six saltines

291
00:23:30,120 --> 00:23:34,640
I'm just saying that doesn't sound like a lot like if I was enjoying a nice bowl of chili

292
00:23:34,920 --> 00:23:38,120
Yeah, I wouldn't think twice about housing twice that lubrication

293
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,000
What way the chili?

294
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:47,820
That's a non-Newtonian like I'm saying and I wish I could just say it and like you guys don't always have to

295
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:52,820
Fight everything I say you just be like accepting of the state of my feelings

296
00:23:52,820 --> 00:23:55,100
You know, I mean like I just feel like that's not a lot of saltines

297
00:23:55,100 --> 00:23:58,220
Yes, but not Justin. I understand your feelings in your feelings are valid

298
00:23:58,220 --> 00:24:01,660
But what you're saying is you see you don't have to do that

299
00:24:01,660 --> 00:24:05,500
But you are making a bold claim which I am allowed to refute without tonight

300
00:24:05,500 --> 00:24:10,300
You are you are saying there's no bolt. There's nothing bold about me feeling

301
00:24:10,940 --> 00:24:16,500
Folks, this is important. I'm stopping on this because it's a really important point for you to take away in your day-to-day life

302
00:24:17,660 --> 00:24:23,160
There's nothing bold about me feeling like it's not very many saltines. Okay

303
00:24:23,160 --> 00:24:26,120
Well, not in opposition to that, but just solely as an individual

304
00:24:26,860 --> 00:24:29,380
I feel like it is a lot of saltines

305
00:24:30,380 --> 00:24:32,380
Okay, say shit now

306
00:24:32,900 --> 00:24:39,740
Yeah, Justin, you can't how dare you step to travel? No, I'm accepting. I'm allowed to feel the way I feel Justin feel that way. I

307
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:42,680
Think that I could definitely eat six

308
00:24:43,860 --> 00:24:47,900
Seconds, that's all I'm saying. Oh god. Let me tell you something as a friend and as a brother

309
00:24:47,900 --> 00:24:52,900
I've gone down not at this exact path Justin

310
00:24:53,060 --> 00:24:58,020
But this is the you are now on the second step to doing this challenge yourself

311
00:24:58,020 --> 00:24:59,460
And if you're not careful

312
00:24:59,460 --> 00:25:05,060
You're gonna you started with that doesn't seem like that much and then the second step is I could totally do that

313
00:25:05,580 --> 00:25:10,220
Right. Yeah, you can see how this is a slippery slope J-man. And do you know what?

314
00:25:10,220 --> 00:25:18,220
I love there's a large portion of our audience that has been listening to our show long enough now that they feel this creeping dread. Oh

315
00:25:18,900 --> 00:25:21,980
They will at some point encounter it it is sir

316
00:25:21,980 --> 00:25:29,060
They are so certain that we have crossed the event horizon of Justin eating six crackers on air that

317
00:25:29,900 --> 00:25:35,560
And they they it's it has filled them with a terror that they cannot like define

318
00:25:35,560 --> 00:25:43,200
I will stand I will stand as a as a bulwark against this act happening on this show as hard as I can

319
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:47,120
Dear listener, please know I'm on your side. I'm less I listen

320
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:51,720
I love our listeners, obviously, but I'm more worried about my human brother and his human mouth

321
00:25:52,520 --> 00:25:56,840
Consuming eating six crackers in in a minute

322
00:25:57,600 --> 00:26:04,060
Now really break that down every 10 seconds. That's how many oh my god

323
00:26:04,060 --> 00:26:08,960
You are I think I could definitely do it. Oh fuck. That's that's right. I'm not gonna do it on the podcast

324
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:12,640
We're gonna hear about some of the tips. This is a good. Yes. Thank you

325
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:17,960
So Justin just so you can start getting ready. I think maybe the best the best version of this is

326
00:26:18,680 --> 00:26:26,840
You get your crackers together and then we edit out the following 60 seconds of audio and just kind of circle back at the on

327
00:26:26,840 --> 00:26:28,000
the other side

328
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,400
with the driest Justin

329
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:34,120
That has a very arid Justin

330
00:26:35,040 --> 00:26:38,520
Okay, so first off believe in yourself. Go ahead and start doing that right now

331
00:26:39,800 --> 00:26:43,800
Are you doing that? Yeah, but I believe in myself. Correct. Yes, fantastic

332
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:46,000
Now that you got your head in the right space

333
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:47,560
It's time to get your crackers in the right space

334
00:26:47,560 --> 00:26:52,520
Which is to say or arrange them in a way that you everybody thinks about like well

335
00:26:52,520 --> 00:26:56,040
How am I gonna get the lubrication and blah blah blah blah blah. Nobody thinks about

336
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:58,680
finger technique

337
00:26:58,680 --> 00:27:00,640
nobody thinks about

338
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:01,680
optimal

339
00:27:01,680 --> 00:27:07,260
Like do you stack them? Do you put them in a row? There's no way you wouldn't do them all at once, right?

340
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:13,860
Well, hold on have water nearby. I can tell from the Foley work that Justin's already got that covered for sure

341
00:27:13,860 --> 00:27:17,040
Yeah, we're moving on to part two and this is a multi-step

342
00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:21,760
this is a layer that you Justin are gonna have to sort of consult with your

343
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:27,360
physician and Lord about picking picking a chunking strategy and

344
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:29,200
I'm sorry

345
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:37,040
Okay, you're saying do I stack three chunk? Um, do I do two chunk two chunk two or you can be one?

346
00:27:37,040 --> 00:27:38,080
I see you

347
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:41,840
We skip we can now skip the following two steps

348
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:47,680
Which is try the three two one strategy or try pairing the crackers for consumption eating two two and two

349
00:27:47,880 --> 00:27:52,480
So Justin's already sort of I'm sort of thinking ahead. Yeah, here's what you do

350
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:57,600
You shove one towards the back of your mouth and then two on either side one on the top one on the bottom

351
00:27:57,600 --> 00:28:00,520
And then another on the front right the cube strategy, right?

352
00:28:00,520 --> 00:28:04,780
You're gonna do that once fun this nice pocket of air right in the middle that you need to breathe

353
00:28:05,280 --> 00:28:07,860
Yeah, you've got to have the air inside of the cracker cube

354
00:28:08,360 --> 00:28:15,280
And that is gonna be the saltiest most flavorful air the saltiest ever ever have the pleasure of breathing in your life

355
00:28:15,280 --> 00:28:16,880
Oh, baby, is it worth it?

356
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:19,560
I watched a video of a guy breaking the world record

357
00:28:19,560 --> 00:28:25,400
Which what would you guys guess for one number of crackers in one minute? Yeah, never care carcass in one minute ten eight

358
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:33,760
Fifteen is the world record and what when he finishes he grabs his shoulder in agony. That doesn't seem right

359
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:36,180
Does he's having a heart attack from all the goddamn salt?

360
00:28:36,900 --> 00:28:38,900
Why would that hurt your shoulder?

361
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:41,360
There's a first he does his head

362
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:49,200
Oh, there's so much we don't know about human physiology that like somebody eats 15

363
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:53,040
Very salty crackers and it makes her shoulder hurt and doctors are like, I don't know

364
00:28:53,560 --> 00:28:55,560
It seems like that

365
00:28:55,680 --> 00:29:01,280
My favorite part of inner space is Lynn Dennis Clade is going down the trachea and he's like, oh no

366
00:29:01,280 --> 00:29:03,280
I took a wrong turn and I'm in the shoulder

367
00:29:03,280 --> 00:29:10,600
Okay, so the creator is watching his creations from above like well certainly they're not gonna eat more than

368
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:17,160
Right because there's some we have not tested in front of work. Hey God God before you put humans out

369
00:29:17,160 --> 00:29:23,800
We didn't notice a defect but the good news it will only trigger only this rare bug

370
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:32,040
It's not even worth patching out which I guess that is a form of patching it out

371
00:29:32,040 --> 00:29:39,640
Yeah, this man dies from his shoulder shoulder his cracker base shoulder injury. I'll put something in the Bible about it. Don't worry. It'll be okay

372
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:47,000
Exodus 15 one

373
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:49,440
Don't do more than

374
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:56,160
Don't do more than 14 crackers in one minute. Why does it say that? That's like right there in the middle of the whole Passover story

375
00:29:56,920 --> 00:30:01,760
Okay, so you can try eating all six crackers at once also that is and that is another seems like that

376
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:05,040
Say that to me that one smells like that stinks of failure

377
00:30:05,040 --> 00:30:05,280
Yeah

378
00:30:05,280 --> 00:30:11,200
That I feel that feels like a knee-jerk like first-timer mistake like let's get them all out of the way. I'm like, no

379
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:14,680
No, I mean, I don't know. Oh

380
00:30:14,680 --> 00:30:20,880
Ooh, here's a cheat code. Oh, oh, oh, okay. Hey, hey, hey everybody lean in

381
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:25,040
Bet your friends that you can do this, right? We're gonna hustle. We're gonna make some money out of this

382
00:30:25,040 --> 00:30:31,960
It's a grift but before this ever starts 24 hours before you're gonna set up like seven humidifiers in this room

383
00:30:32,160 --> 00:30:34,920
You're gonna get that air so wicked moist

384
00:30:35,560 --> 00:30:36,880
Right. Oh

385
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:45,880
So moist environment. Oh, yeah, you do this in the fucking rainforest cafe, which I assume is very moist. Why do you think that's a moist building?

386
00:30:45,880 --> 00:30:49,600
Cuz it's called the rainforest cafe Griffin think they keep it arid

387
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:52,240
I mean you can do it in the rainforest

388
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:58,440
But you're gonna lose a lot of money that you're gonna win just on travel alone and getting a guide and supplies and stuff

389
00:30:59,080 --> 00:31:03,320
It's expensive to go to this way too expensive to go to the rainforest these days. Yeah

390
00:31:03,320 --> 00:31:10,080
So the next thing that you need to know about is practice before the challenge which Justin you can skip that step

391
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:15,840
You're gonna be fine. You've had crackers before right? You've eaten crackers. I've done plenty of cracker practice

392
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:18,960
Okay, or crack this as we call it. No one

393
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:27,500
Did call it that. Oh, so you're not in. Okay. I thought I just thought you were in, you know, the circle this next one's dope

394
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:30,640
Keep your cool

395
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:36,000
If you get over excited or nervous you may breathe in the crumbs and you're rushed to stuff the crackers in your mouth and you

396
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:41,280
Won't be able to finish in time. Yeah, avoid shoving the crackers in your mouth as you could jab the back of your throat or poke

397
00:31:41,280 --> 00:31:45,760
Your gums. Hey pain is weakness leaving the body two rules. Don't huff don't stuff

398
00:31:46,520 --> 00:31:49,320
Don't huff or stuff. Thank you Travis again

399
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:52,600
Great great advice from the cracker King himself

400
00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:58,280
This is where the truth comes out Justin. I'm sorry. I fought you earlier, but I was in the circuit back in the day

401
00:31:58,280 --> 00:32:01,400
And I thought you're gonna say the circus. I was in the circus

402
00:32:02,040 --> 00:32:07,840
That'd be and they fed us in crackers. Come see the incredible cracker eating boy. Not again, please

403
00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:12,400
I just want to go to college eat more crackers. This is all you'll ever be good for

404
00:32:13,080 --> 00:32:15,080
Why did I ever get this magic feather?

405
00:32:18,440 --> 00:32:22,520
So he's like wandering by they're like so Darlene what was three times

406
00:32:22,520 --> 00:32:29,280
348 and tribes like 1200. It's like he's amazing. He knows the answer to math. He can do math

407
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:31,440
I told you cracker boy can't be taught

408
00:32:32,120 --> 00:32:34,120
No, believe me

409
00:32:34,120 --> 00:32:41,720
I'm gonna find some way to distribute the image that accompany the keep your cool tip because it's just a boy giving like a

410
00:32:45,480 --> 00:32:47,480
What this is a tattoo

411
00:32:47,480 --> 00:32:52,280
Whereas the boy the boy is holding some five crackers which drives me up

412
00:32:57,560 --> 00:32:59,560
It's a good image, yeah

413
00:33:05,160 --> 00:33:10,940
Yeah, sure and the last the last tip is to just go for it so just go for everything you need

414
00:33:10,940 --> 00:33:16,280
Well, oh the reason he's holding five crackers is what is already in his mouth. Oh, I see I see

415
00:33:16,280 --> 00:33:21,600
I see so fucking chill. You can't even tell he's very relaxed some community Q&A real quick

416
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:23,600
How dry will my mouth be when I finish?

417
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:27,880
Extremely, you know, can I impress someone by eating six saltine crackers in a minute?

418
00:33:27,880 --> 00:33:32,480
Maybe depends on the person on the person more than anything really? Yeah

419
00:33:33,800 --> 00:33:39,040
Why are saltine crackers made to soak saliva and be dry? That's a fucked up way of thinking about

420
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:42,520
yeah, I think saltine crackers are made to be crunchy and

421
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:45,320
delicious little

422
00:33:45,320 --> 00:33:50,520
Couture malt for a chili. I don't think of them as mouth mouth towels

423
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:55,040
Well, they are they're sorry. Yeah, I mean you're gonna use them in soup and chili. They're absorbent

424
00:33:55,520 --> 00:34:01,160
They're absorbent, but I don't think of them as that. I don't slight them for that. Like that's a feature not a bug

425
00:34:01,160 --> 00:34:03,160
Oh, absolutely. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah

426
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:08,180
Like you wouldn't be like, oh man, this ShamWow picked up all my water. You'd be excited

427
00:34:09,060 --> 00:34:11,060
exactly

428
00:34:11,060 --> 00:34:15,400
So juice you ready? Yep. Okay. Oh

429
00:34:16,420 --> 00:34:21,260
You want me to actually do this or we can make pretend like a minute has passed and you did it

430
00:34:21,500 --> 00:34:25,740
Well, can you guys wait 30 seconds? See if I have saltines? Yep, I guess so

431
00:34:28,420 --> 00:34:31,140
How are you Griffin me? Yeah

432
00:34:31,940 --> 00:34:34,180
Pretty good. Okay. Awesome, man

433
00:34:34,820 --> 00:34:40,280
Well, I didn't have me saltines. Fuck. All right. I got two I got two Ritz got two Ritz

434
00:34:40,280 --> 00:34:46,360
Okay, here's what we'll do. Yeah, we'll subdivide juice you eat those two Ritz in of in eight seconds

435
00:34:46,980 --> 00:34:51,380
Ready set go. Well, I can hear you eating it right now. He didn't even get it. They weren't for the oh

436
00:34:52,060 --> 00:34:55,240
They weren't so wait, hold on. Wait juice. You only have one Ritz now

437
00:34:57,900 --> 00:35:01,060
Juice you gotta eat one Ritz in three seconds. I

438
00:35:02,260 --> 00:35:06,220
Just tell me when you're ready. Tell me when you're ready. This is gonna be fucking funny. Tell me when you're ready

439
00:35:06,220 --> 00:35:09,840
Okay, three two one go

440
00:35:12,620 --> 00:35:14,620
1003 did you finish? Ah

441
00:35:16,420 --> 00:35:22,140
So not so easy is it not so easy is it eating six saltines no, but I did it in less than ten seconds

442
00:35:25,220 --> 00:35:28,660
You know that they don't have corners go to Wendy's

443
00:35:29,260 --> 00:35:34,500
Why would you there's other places to get saltines Justin they sell go to Dollar General right now

444
00:35:34,500 --> 00:35:36,800
Why are you getting crackers in weird places?

445
00:35:37,260 --> 00:35:41,960
Why are you getting mad dollar general is close that that was just close and that's good

446
00:35:41,960 --> 00:35:46,180
If you don't want to pay full price for you know, I'm sorry Justin

447
00:35:46,180 --> 00:35:51,340
I think you need to get the name brand so that we can like make this a repeatable. It's name brand. It's just like

448
00:35:52,100 --> 00:35:56,140
The expiration dates are all smudged a little bit. Oh, so there's even drier

449
00:35:57,540 --> 00:36:01,660
Intellectual case for or not or they could be wetter. I don't know how yeah

450
00:36:01,660 --> 00:36:06,060
That's true. What they're so absorbent. This is Justin sequel to cool hand Luke

451
00:36:09,660 --> 00:36:13,060
Luke was like I can eat a thousand eggs in five seconds

452
00:36:16,660 --> 00:36:21,700
You can't do this cool hand Luke no no no time you guys no no stop. What are you doing?

453
00:36:21,700 --> 00:36:27,980
I'm right. I missed I skipped breakfast this morning. I'm wicked hungry. I can eat 1000 eggs in four seconds

454
00:36:27,980 --> 00:36:32,380
Oh, it's like it's like hyperbole. We're like, you know, get me

455
00:36:33,140 --> 00:36:35,860
Where are we supposed to get a thousand eggs? We're in prison

456
00:36:36,460 --> 00:36:42,940
Okay, this is gonna give us eggs you think that we go into the prison kitchen and say give us a thousand eggs

457
00:36:42,940 --> 00:36:46,380
They will be like, yep, seems fine. Nothing weird here. Come on

458
00:36:46,540 --> 00:36:52,340
This isn't for like an escape attempt thing. Is it no my man cool hand Luke is gonna eat a thousand in four seconds

459
00:36:52,340 --> 00:36:59,580
Three seconds, holy shit, that's less than you started. This is right. This is where I had care for the baby

460
00:36:59,580 --> 00:37:01,260
They're filming the movie cool cool

461
00:37:01,260 --> 00:37:08,340
Hey Luke, and then everyone's just kind of standing around on a break and Paul Newman goes the director. He's like, hmm

462
00:37:11,700 --> 00:37:15,660
You know how you said you were looking for that kind of like cornerstone scene, you know

463
00:37:15,660 --> 00:37:18,780
You want um, I thought one scene for the boot now Paul

464
00:37:18,780 --> 00:37:21,940
Are you gonna suggest eating much eggs again?

465
00:37:24,580 --> 00:37:27,740
Okay, all right, I'm listening I'm listening it's a lot of eggs

466
00:37:28,780 --> 00:37:30,780
Like wait, no, no, no

467
00:37:33,060 --> 00:37:35,060
It's like a bet

468
00:37:35,260 --> 00:37:40,580
It's like a bet they have to dare me to do it. Yeah Paul you eat 50 eggs every morning

469
00:37:40,580 --> 00:37:45,060
No one dares you do it. It's like I think it'd be cool to put in the movie people want to see this

470
00:37:45,060 --> 00:37:49,860
It'd be a cool scene to put in a movie is we eating 50 eggs. No one's ever done it

471
00:37:50,220 --> 00:37:56,060
We haven't introduced the idea that your character especially likes it and it doesn't come back in the script

472
00:37:56,060 --> 00:37:58,580
Well, it doesn't come back. It's not like later though

473
00:37:58,580 --> 00:38:02,380
There's a wall made of eggs and only one man can eat them out of the prison, right?

474
00:38:02,820 --> 00:38:08,560
Though hey, it's not too late for that director Paul. It's part of the traditional hero's journey

475
00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:14,140
You leave your home you grow you eat a thousand eggs in two seconds

476
00:38:14,140 --> 00:38:17,980
Mm-hmm, and then you come back home and everything's different and you're a man

477
00:38:17,980 --> 00:38:22,140
We did we go to the money zone because it feels like this is the money zone

478
00:38:22,140 --> 00:38:24,720
This week's episode is brought to you by the egg council. Okay?

479
00:38:25,300 --> 00:38:27,300

480
00:38:28,420 --> 00:38:35,260
No, we can't it's weird down there. Okay. Well, it can't be any weirder than it is out here already

481
00:38:35,260 --> 00:38:42,540
All right, okay stop let's go to the money's in

482
00:38:48,060 --> 00:38:49,780
And like Griffin doesn't like jokes anymore

483
00:38:49,780 --> 00:38:57,060

484
00:38:57,740 --> 00:39:02,740

500
00:40:10,340 --> 00:40:15,380
They could restrain you so it could be brown. They could be blue. They could be violet. You know, let's go

501
00:40:16,340 --> 00:40:17,380
this

502

00:44:12,400 --> 00:44:15,740
It's eight minutes and 40 seconds in and this guy's just done

Done the deed, okay

544
00:44:18,020 --> 00:44:24,700
If you've never seen cool hand Luke because you're not a 45 year old person. It's a eats eats 50 eggs

545
00:44:24,860 --> 00:44:27,940
That's not I think that good context. Thank you. Thank you

546
00:44:28,100 --> 00:44:33,180
This is from Gunny's food and art room by the way, shout out which is the and which is this?

547
00:44:33,180 --> 00:44:57,180
50 hard-boiled eggs. No, no, is this food or art? Both. Okay, fantastic. Alright. Oh my god. I didn't think 50 hard-boiled eggs was gonna be that bad. I mean I knew it was gonna be bad. The density of them compared to just making a scrambled egg is a big difference. Daddy, look. Ah, cool.

548
00:44:57,180 --> 00:45:24,180
I'm sorry. Yeah, he did it in front of his two kids. Did he say there's a big difference between eating a scrambled egg and eating 50 hard-boiled eggs? The density, Travis. The density of the hard-boiled egg, yeah. This video has 757 views. It's about to have a bunch more, I bet. Yeah, shout out.

549
00:45:24,180 --> 00:45:33,180
It's really funny that he would do that with his kids there. What a great way of spending time with their kiddos. You would too, though, Justin, let's be honest. Oh, absolutely, yeah.

550
00:45:33,180 --> 00:45:56,180
Cool. I want to munch. Squad. I want to munch. Squad. Welcome to Munch Squad. It's a podcast within a podcast. Profiling the latest and greatest in brand eating.

551
00:45:56,180 --> 00:46:13,180
This is more of a regular public service announcement. This isn't so much for comedy, but I do want to alert everybody that the McRib will return to US menus on November 1st. Okay, hold on. Let me put it in the calendar. One second. How long has it been?

552
00:46:13,180 --> 00:46:24,180
I don't know. The last time there was a bunch of pork meat sitting on the shelves and Uncle McDonald had to get it out to the people. Yeah. It's been a long time. I mean, it's been a while, right? The pandemic hurt everyone equally.

553
00:46:24,180 --> 00:46:45,180
Yeah. The McRib, a lot of people don't like to talk about it, so I will. Thank you, Justin. You're so brave. Yeah, it's really brave of me to say that. Do you all realize that they shape it to look like it's got bones? Yeah, definitely. And then you eat the bones? You think about that? Yeah. Yeah, I guess so.

554
00:46:45,180 --> 00:47:04,180
Apoyo Loco is going to bring back a crunchy taco in honor of National Taco Day. That's good of them. In honor of National Taco Day, Apoyo Loco, the nation's leading fire grilled chicken restaurant chain, is bringing back its popular crunchy taco as its first ever digital-only menu item. Wait, what?

555
00:47:04,180 --> 00:47:30,180
Available for purchase through the Apoyo Loco app and website. So that's right. If you go into Apoyo Loco and you say, hi, I'm a regular sane person and I would like a crunchy chicken taco here, they would say, you need to leave. Please go. You should leave. And get on your phone and order it through the app.

556
00:47:30,180 --> 00:47:32,180
While you stare at them.

557
00:47:32,180 --> 00:47:37,180
You can look at us in here and we do have them in here, but you cannot order them there.

558
00:47:37,180 --> 00:47:42,180
You cannot use our Wi-Fi. You cannot use our Wi-Fi.

559
00:47:42,180 --> 00:47:48,180
Our customers have been very vocal on social media about how much they love and miss our crunchy taco.

560
00:47:48,180 --> 00:48:02,180
You know what? Apoyo Loco, I haven't double checked that, but I will. I'm just the sort of person that has the amount of free time requisite to double check that. And you know that I will. And they're bringing it back.

561
00:48:02,180 --> 00:48:10,180
We're thrilled to be bringing back this much loved classic just in time for National Taco Day. And we're excited to continue our digital evolution.

562
00:48:10,180 --> 00:48:24,180
That's right. Apoyo Loco is becoming a sentient cyber restaurant with this rollout as the very first Apoyo Loco menu item that can only be purchased online or through the app.

563
00:48:24,180 --> 00:48:30,180
You cannot go to Apoyo Loco and order this.

564
00:48:30,180 --> 00:48:40,180
That is, listen, I know that I have a theater degree. I make podcasts. I'm not a business boy. I know this.

565
00:48:40,180 --> 00:48:47,180
But what is the business strategy here that says like we make it less available?

566
00:48:47,180 --> 00:48:49,180
I don't understand the strategy.

567
00:48:49,180 --> 00:48:58,180
But it's the exact same thing that they've been doing with like, it's the same thing as the McRib. It makes it seem scarce and exciting.

568
00:48:58,180 --> 00:49:03,180
But it's not scarce. Like the McRib is like, don't miss your chance to get this.

569
00:49:03,180 --> 00:49:10,180
This is like saying like, oh, I came in to get it. I didn't want to miss my chance. Well, it's not here. It's in your phone.

570
00:49:10,180 --> 00:49:12,180
You gotta cyber it.

571
00:49:12,180 --> 00:49:14,180
You gotta cyber order it.

572
00:49:14,180 --> 00:49:28,180
So I searched Twitter for mentions of Apoyo Loco and to see what people are saying about it. Like they're being like really demanding about it.

573
00:49:28,180 --> 00:49:35,180
Marianne says, Carlinch, Carlinch, do you hear that sound? Apoyo Loco is the glorious crunchy taco noise.

574
00:49:35,180 --> 00:49:39,180
Hashtag bring back crunchy tacos. That's from September 14th.

575
00:49:39,180 --> 00:49:41,180
Okay.

576
00:49:41,180 --> 00:49:43,180
June 21st.

577
00:49:43,180 --> 00:49:48,180
Apoyo Loco, bring back my damn crunchy taco, please.

578
00:49:48,180 --> 00:49:53,180
That was a wide, so there's just those two people then that want this?

579
00:49:53,180 --> 00:49:55,180
January 3rd.

580
00:49:55,180 --> 00:49:57,180
That's a pretty big span.

581
00:49:57,180 --> 00:49:59,180
We've heard you. We've heard you.

582
00:49:59,180 --> 00:50:01,180
Whoa, whoa, stop yelling.

583
00:50:01,180 --> 00:50:03,180
Shut up everyone. We get it.

584
00:50:03,180 --> 00:50:05,180
We get it.

585
00:50:05,180 --> 00:50:10,180
Bring back your crunchy chicken tacos already, please. I want to give you all my money again.

586
00:50:10,180 --> 00:50:13,180
Hi, police. I'd like to follow a harassment report.

587
00:50:13,180 --> 00:50:19,180
People will not stop about these tacos. And it's like, I'm just trying to live my life.

588
00:50:19,180 --> 00:50:25,180
Before that, it was one in December and November and September.

589
00:50:25,180 --> 00:50:27,180
And that's...

590
00:50:27,180 --> 00:50:29,180
Yep.

591
00:50:29,180 --> 00:50:31,180
July.

592
00:50:31,180 --> 00:50:35,180
July 22. There have been eight tweets about this in the past 18 months.

593
00:50:35,180 --> 00:50:37,180
No one cares.

594
00:50:37,180 --> 00:50:39,180
No one gives a shit.

595
00:50:39,180 --> 00:50:41,180
People care a lot.

596
00:50:41,180 --> 00:50:47,180
What we should do is tweet at Apoyo Loco and ask them, please don't bring back the crunchy chicken taco.

597
00:50:47,180 --> 00:50:49,180
Ask them to bring back the McPizza.

598
00:50:49,180 --> 00:50:51,180
Okay.

599
00:50:51,180 --> 00:50:54,180
That's what outrage looks like.

600
00:50:54,180 --> 00:50:58,180
Say, hey Apoyo Loco, McDonald's isn't doing anything with it.

601
00:50:58,180 --> 00:51:00,180
Can you bring back the McPizza?

602
00:51:00,180 --> 00:51:02,180
Can you bring back the McPizza?

603
00:51:02,180 --> 00:51:05,180
Will you please invent an incredibly soft taco?

604
00:51:05,180 --> 00:51:07,180
So soft.

605
00:51:07,180 --> 00:51:10,180
A non-Newtonian taco.

606
00:51:10,180 --> 00:51:13,180
That's my second time using that phrase this episode.

607
00:51:13,180 --> 00:51:15,180
Good job, Travis.

608
00:51:15,180 --> 00:51:17,180
Do we want to do one more question?

609
00:51:17,180 --> 00:51:19,180
I'd love that.

610
00:51:19,180 --> 00:51:22,180
I recently got promoted at work and I'm starting to work as a cheese monger.

611
00:51:22,180 --> 00:51:25,180
Which is very exciting because I love cheese.

612
00:51:25,180 --> 00:51:27,180
Better than the alternative.

613
00:51:27,180 --> 00:51:29,180
There's only two things you can really monger.

614
00:51:29,180 --> 00:51:31,180
Cheese and beer.

615
00:51:31,180 --> 00:51:32,180
Yeah.

616
00:51:32,180 --> 00:51:34,180
It's true.

617
00:51:34,180 --> 00:51:39,180
I had an old cowbell on a shelf in the cheese department known as Cheesetown.

618
00:51:39,180 --> 00:51:44,180
And old cheese mongers used to ring it when they managed to cut a perfect increment of cheese for a customer.

619
00:51:44,180 --> 00:51:45,180
I remember that.

620
00:51:45,180 --> 00:51:46,180
Half pound, fourth pound.

621
00:51:46,180 --> 00:51:47,180
I love this.

622
00:51:47,180 --> 00:51:48,180
That's so good.

623
00:51:48,180 --> 00:51:49,180
I love it.

624
00:51:49,180 --> 00:51:50,180
I used to do that shit at TCBY.

625
00:51:50,180 --> 00:51:51,180
Did you?

626
00:51:51,180 --> 00:51:52,180
Yeah.

627
00:51:52,180 --> 00:51:59,180
If we could get a perfect seven-ouncer on a small or I forget the exact sizes, but there wasn't a bell, but I would treat myself to just a fistful of-

628
00:51:59,180 --> 00:52:00,180
A small?

629
00:52:00,180 --> 00:52:03,180
A small was nearly a half pound of yogurt?

630
00:52:03,180 --> 00:52:04,180
Yeah, I guess so.

631
00:52:04,180 --> 00:52:06,180
Damn, Griff.

632
00:52:06,180 --> 00:52:08,180
The country's most generous yogurt were like-

633
00:52:08,180 --> 00:52:09,180
Yeah.

634
00:52:09,180 --> 00:52:12,180
Hey, you know I didn't set that.

635
00:52:12,180 --> 00:52:16,180
I wasn't making TCBY policy decisions, juicer.

636
00:52:16,180 --> 00:52:21,180
I'm just saying that TCBY is now a nail salon and maybe there's something to that.

637
00:52:21,180 --> 00:52:22,180
Maybe they were a little too generous.

638
00:52:22,180 --> 00:52:26,180
They're a bourbon through the profits.

639
00:52:26,180 --> 00:52:27,180
Wait, Griffin.

640
00:52:27,180 --> 00:52:32,180
Griffin, you haven't been doing seven ounces at a small, have you?

641
00:52:32,180 --> 00:52:37,180
Nobody really uses it anymore, but I want to bring it back so I can ring the cheese bell.

642
00:52:37,180 --> 00:52:39,180
Sorry, so I can ring the cheese bell.

643
00:52:39,180 --> 00:52:41,180
How do I smoothly bring it back?

644
00:52:41,180 --> 00:52:42,180
That's from Haley.

645
00:52:42,180 --> 00:52:47,180
You can't smoothly bring back a bell practice.

646
00:52:47,180 --> 00:52:48,180
You just do it.

647
00:52:48,180 --> 00:52:50,180
You do it, and it's loud.

648
00:52:50,180 --> 00:52:53,180
Everyone, if you're listening to this, stop it.

649
00:52:53,180 --> 00:52:56,180
I'm going to make this a year theme soon if we can shoehorn it in.

650
00:52:56,180 --> 00:52:59,180
Stop waiting for permission.

651
00:52:59,180 --> 00:53:02,180
No one ever got permission to do something interesting.

652
00:53:02,180 --> 00:53:03,180
Just do it.

653
00:53:03,180 --> 00:53:07,180
Well, that's not, I would say, a catch-all tagline.

654
00:53:07,180 --> 00:53:15,180
No, obviously not, but like, okay, let me rephrase that in a way that's more of a blanket statement.

655
00:53:15,180 --> 00:53:18,180
No one will ask you to innovate.

656
00:53:18,180 --> 00:53:19,180
How's that?

657
00:53:19,180 --> 00:53:21,180
No one will request you.

658
00:53:21,180 --> 00:53:23,180
No one's going to ask you to innovate.

659
00:53:23,180 --> 00:53:25,180
If they thought of it, they would have done it.

660
00:53:25,180 --> 00:53:27,180
You've got the bell.

661
00:53:27,180 --> 00:53:28,180
Look in your hand.

662
00:53:28,180 --> 00:53:30,180
There's a bell ringer.

663
00:53:30,180 --> 00:53:37,180
That is so in line with what I was going to say, which my advice is, ring it, right?

664
00:53:37,180 --> 00:53:39,180
And then someone says, what are you doing?

665
00:53:39,180 --> 00:53:45,180
Just don't, no couching, just say, that's what you do when you cut a perfect increment.

666
00:53:45,180 --> 00:53:49,180
Not, I thought we could start doing this, or that's what they used to do.

667
00:53:49,180 --> 00:53:50,180
Just statement of fact.

668
00:53:50,180 --> 00:53:51,180
This is what's done.

669
00:53:51,180 --> 00:53:53,180
This is what you do, right?

670
00:53:53,180 --> 00:53:54,180
This is how it's done.

671
00:53:54,180 --> 00:53:56,180
And maybe they've worked there longer than you, or they're new.

672
00:53:56,180 --> 00:53:57,180
It doesn't matter.

673
00:53:57,180 --> 00:54:02,180
If you make it a statement of fact, this is what you do when you do this.

674
00:54:02,180 --> 00:54:03,180
We've always done this.

675
00:54:03,180 --> 00:54:06,180
Then they will be like, oh, I didn't know that.

676
00:54:06,180 --> 00:54:10,180
That's the only response to that kind of confidence.

677
00:54:10,180 --> 00:54:15,180
Yeah, it was just, okay, listen, the alternative is you just got a bell.

678
00:54:15,180 --> 00:54:17,180
Why do we have a bell here, Todd?

679
00:54:17,180 --> 00:54:20,180
If we're not supposed to be ringing it when we cut a perfect increment.

680
00:54:20,180 --> 00:54:25,180
I will say, along these same lines, one time I was at a Trader Joseph's,

681
00:54:25,180 --> 00:54:28,180
and there's a bell there hanging next to the checkout.

682
00:54:28,180 --> 00:54:32,180
And I mistakenly believe that one rings that bell when it's like,

683
00:54:32,180 --> 00:54:34,180
hey, I got good service and I want everyone to know.

684
00:54:34,180 --> 00:54:35,180
And it is not.

685
00:54:35,180 --> 00:54:36,180
You what?

686
00:54:36,180 --> 00:54:39,180
You ring the bell when you need help with a checkout

687
00:54:39,180 --> 00:54:42,180
or when they need some people working there.

688
00:54:42,180 --> 00:54:43,180
I did not know that.

689
00:54:43,180 --> 00:54:44,180
I thought it was like that.

690
00:54:44,180 --> 00:54:46,180
You thought it was for customers to be like,

691
00:54:46,180 --> 00:54:49,180
great job, Trader Joe's, ring a ding, ding, ding.

692
00:54:49,180 --> 00:54:50,180
Yeah.

693
00:54:50,180 --> 00:54:53,180
Now, Griffin, you think that's wild because you know the truth, right?

694
00:54:53,180 --> 00:54:54,180
Right.

695
00:54:54,180 --> 00:54:58,180
But if you didn't know that it was for employees to use,

696
00:54:58,180 --> 00:55:03,180
and there's a bell hanging there within arm's reach of the general public.

697
00:55:03,180 --> 00:55:04,180
Yeah.

698
00:55:04,180 --> 00:55:08,180
Wouldn't you think like, this must be for me because this can't be the system

699
00:55:08,180 --> 00:55:13,180
they use to contact one another in the year 2021.

700
00:55:13,180 --> 00:55:16,180
Right. They're not sailors on an old ship.

701
00:55:16,180 --> 00:55:17,180
This is what I'm saying.

702
00:55:17,180 --> 00:55:19,180
This can't be the most effective means.

703
00:55:19,180 --> 00:55:23,180
When I've been in other grocery stores where they can get on a microphone

704
00:55:23,180 --> 00:55:27,180
and say, hey, Todd, come help me bag.

705
00:55:27,180 --> 00:55:28,180
Yeah.

706
00:55:28,180 --> 00:55:29,180
Right?

707
00:55:29,180 --> 00:55:32,180
So the bell must be there for fun.

708
00:55:32,180 --> 00:55:34,180
For my enjoyment.

709
00:55:34,180 --> 00:55:35,180
This is what I'm saying.

710
00:55:35,180 --> 00:55:37,180
The bell can't be there for, oh, I'm sorry.

711
00:55:37,180 --> 00:55:39,180
I didn't realize this is a work bell.

712
00:55:39,180 --> 00:55:40,180
Yeah.

713
00:55:40,180 --> 00:55:41,180
Business bell.

714
00:55:41,180 --> 00:55:42,180
Yeah.

715
00:55:42,180 --> 00:55:43,180
Good point, Trav.

716
00:55:43,180 --> 00:55:44,180
Thank you.

717
00:55:44,180 --> 00:55:46,180
I just don't want tweets.

718
00:55:46,180 --> 00:55:47,180
I bet that momentum's back.

719
00:55:47,180 --> 00:55:49,180
Oh, hell yeah, man.

720
00:55:49,180 --> 00:55:50,180
Fuck yeah.

721
00:55:50,180 --> 00:55:51,180
With carnage and shit.

722
00:55:51,180 --> 00:55:52,180
Yeah.

723
00:55:52,180 --> 00:55:53,180
With carnage.

724
00:55:53,180 --> 00:55:55,180
I hope Spider-Man's in this one.

725
00:55:55,180 --> 00:55:58,180
Why did we go there?

726
00:55:58,180 --> 00:56:02,180
I just wanted to mention, I don't think we'll get a chance to do a watch for it

727
00:56:02,180 --> 00:56:04,180
because I didn't get a chance to do a watch with the first one.

728
00:56:04,180 --> 00:56:06,180
I guess it is pretty cool that he's back.

729
00:56:06,180 --> 00:56:07,180
Yeah.

730
00:56:07,180 --> 00:56:08,180
I just think it's cool that Venom's back.

731
00:56:08,180 --> 00:56:12,180
And I saw in the trailer this time, speaking of eggs, there's Venom making breakfast.

732
00:56:12,180 --> 00:56:13,180
That's great.

733
00:56:13,180 --> 00:56:14,180
Venom makes breakfast in this one?

734
00:56:14,180 --> 00:56:15,180
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

735
00:56:15,180 --> 00:56:17,180
He's a mass murderer, but he makes a fun breakfast.

736
00:56:17,180 --> 00:56:18,180
Cool.

737
00:56:18,180 --> 00:56:19,180
So that's our show.

738
00:56:19,180 --> 00:56:21,180
Thank you all so much for listening to it.

739
00:56:21,180 --> 00:56:24,180
We talked a lot about Venom and eggs today.

740
00:56:24,180 --> 00:56:28,180
We always tell people when they ask, where should I start with My Brother, My Brother,

741
00:56:28,180 --> 00:56:29,180
and Me?

742
00:56:29,180 --> 00:56:33,180
And after this, I've always said, just start with the newest one.

743
00:56:33,180 --> 00:56:36,180
And after recording this episode, I have two new answers.

744
00:56:36,180 --> 00:56:38,180
The first one is, maybe don't.

745
00:56:38,180 --> 00:56:43,180
The second one is, just pick one other than this one.

746
00:56:43,180 --> 00:56:47,180
Have you checked out 579 or 581?

747
00:56:47,180 --> 00:56:49,180
Those are two really good ones.

748
00:56:49,180 --> 00:56:53,180
I'm going to need a great place to start.

749
00:56:53,180 --> 00:56:58,180
Hey, speaking of great things, big exciting news.

750
00:56:58,180 --> 00:57:04,180
November 5th, remember, remember, 9 PM Eastern time, we're doing a live and virtual Adventure

751
00:57:04,180 --> 00:57:05,180
Zone show.

752
00:57:05,180 --> 00:57:06,180
Whoa.

753
00:57:06,180 --> 00:57:13,180
It's going to be the third installment in Adventure Zone Hootenanny, which we have done

754
00:57:13,180 --> 00:57:16,180
before with Lasers and Feelings, created by John Harper.

755
00:57:16,180 --> 00:57:19,180
So that is an absolute blast.

756
00:57:19,180 --> 00:57:21,180
If you haven't checked those shows out before, don't you worry.

757
00:57:21,180 --> 00:57:26,180
We're going to do a little like previously on, so you can come to it brand new.

758
00:57:26,180 --> 00:57:29,180
It's not the richest narrative tapestry.

759
00:57:29,180 --> 00:57:30,180
It'll probably be okay.

760
00:57:30,180 --> 00:57:32,180
You're not going to be too far behind.

761
00:57:32,180 --> 00:57:35,180
It's a futuristic country band in space.

762
00:57:35,180 --> 00:57:36,180
Don't you worry about it.

763
00:57:36,180 --> 00:57:38,180
Tickets are just $10.

764
00:57:38,180 --> 00:57:41,180
You can get those at bit.ly slash Taz virtual.

765
00:57:41,180 --> 00:57:45,180
And video on demand will be available for two weeks after the show, if you can't make

766
00:57:45,180 --> 00:57:48,180
it to November 5th at 9 PM Eastern time, but go get those tickets now.

767
00:57:48,180 --> 00:57:49,180
I know what you're wondering.

768
00:57:49,180 --> 00:57:54,180
Will it be important for you to be very familiar with the first two in order to enjoy the third

769
00:57:54,180 --> 00:57:55,180
one?

770
00:57:55,180 --> 00:57:58,180
And let me say as somebody who's going to be recording the third one, I certainly hope

771
00:57:58,180 --> 00:57:59,180
not.

772
00:57:59,180 --> 00:58:00,180
Thanks.

773
00:58:00,180 --> 00:58:01,180
Did you thank Montaigne?

774
00:58:01,180 --> 00:58:02,180
No.

775
00:58:02,180 --> 00:58:03,180
You want to do it this time?

776
00:58:03,180 --> 00:58:04,180
No, I'd rather you did.

777
00:58:04,180 --> 00:58:06,180
Hey, thanks to Montaigne for the use of our theme song, My Life.

778
00:58:06,180 --> 00:58:07,180
Because that's the way it's done.

779
00:58:07,180 --> 00:58:08,180
Better with you.

780
00:58:08,180 --> 00:58:12,180
It's a great track with a fun video and a great catchy beat and a rhythm that you can

781
00:58:12,180 --> 00:58:15,180
really bop your booty to.

782
00:58:15,180 --> 00:58:19,180
So that felt just awful saying that.

783
00:58:19,180 --> 00:58:21,180
Oh, also, wait, hold on.

784
00:58:21,180 --> 00:58:22,180
We got new merch.

785
00:58:22,180 --> 00:58:24,180
We got a new month started.

786
00:58:24,180 --> 00:58:27,180
We got Adventure Zone notebooks, Candlelight's wrapping paper.

787
00:58:27,180 --> 00:58:29,180
We got a new pin of the month.

788
00:58:29,180 --> 00:58:36,180
It is Hellraven, a.k.a. secret identity, Del Craven from, I believe, Just Us?

789
00:58:36,180 --> 00:58:37,180
The Adventure Zone live shows?

790
00:58:37,180 --> 00:58:38,180
Yes, just us.

791
00:58:38,180 --> 00:58:39,180
Yes.

792
00:58:39,180 --> 00:58:40,180
And that benefits-

793
00:58:40,180 --> 00:58:45,180
It's looking incredibly intense in feathered garb.

794
00:58:45,180 --> 00:58:49,180
The proceeds from that benefit the National Latina Institute for Reproductive Justice,

795
00:58:49,180 --> 00:58:54,180
which builds Latina and Latinx power to fight for the fundamental human right to reproductive

796
00:58:54,180 --> 00:58:56,180
health, dignity, and justice.

797
00:58:56,180 --> 00:58:59,180
So make sure you check those out.

798
00:58:59,180 --> 00:59:04,180
Also, in case you missed the news, Adventure Zone is now weekly, which is very exciting.

799
00:59:04,180 --> 00:59:10,180
If you are a fan of the Great British Bake Off, mine and Teresa's Bake Off watch-along

800
00:59:10,180 --> 00:59:17,180
show, Bake On, is back and available in Podcatchers.

801
00:59:17,180 --> 00:59:19,180
And yeah, that's it.

802
00:59:19,180 --> 00:59:20,180
That's it.

803
00:59:20,180 --> 00:59:22,180
Hey, here's the final Yahoo.

804
00:59:22,180 --> 00:59:29,180
This one was sent in by the Tumblin Mold Man.

805
00:59:29,180 --> 00:59:30,180
Oh, boy.

806
00:59:30,180 --> 00:59:32,180
Yeah, this one was sent in by the Tumblin Mold Man.

807
00:59:32,180 --> 00:59:34,180
Haven't heard from him in a while.

808
00:59:34,180 --> 00:59:41,180
Yeah, he's like a cool dude who is like really yucky, but in like a cool, transgressive way.

809
00:59:41,180 --> 00:59:42,180
Yeah.

810
00:59:42,180 --> 00:59:43,180
Got it.

811
00:59:43,180 --> 00:59:48,180
Like he comes to town and you might be uncomfortable at first, but then when the zombies attack

812
00:59:48,180 --> 00:59:50,180
or whatever, you're glad he's there.

813
00:59:50,180 --> 00:59:53,180
You're glad that you can find the yucky mold man.

814
00:59:53,180 --> 00:59:57,180
Because at first you think maybe he's causing the sickness because he's the yucky mold man,

815
00:59:57,180 --> 00:59:58,180
right?

816
00:59:58,180 --> 00:59:59,180
But no, no, no.

817
00:59:59,180 --> 01:00:00,180
He just knows how to stop it.

818
01:00:00,180 --> 01:00:01,180
And that's how he got that name.

819
01:00:01,180 --> 01:00:02,180
Yeah.

820
01:00:02,180 --> 01:00:09,180
And it's asked by the prince, the current prince, one of the princes.

821
01:00:09,180 --> 01:00:10,180
Uh-huh.

822
01:00:10,180 --> 01:00:11,180
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

823
01:00:11,180 --> 01:00:12,180
One of the two princes.

824
01:00:12,180 --> 01:00:13,180
Yeah.

825
01:00:13,180 --> 01:00:14,180
Who asks...

826
01:00:14,180 --> 01:00:15,180
Come on.

827
01:00:15,180 --> 01:00:16,180
What's it say, Griffin?

828
01:00:16,180 --> 01:00:17,180
Just say it.

829
01:00:17,180 --> 01:00:18,180
Just read it.

830
01:00:18,180 --> 01:00:19,180
The prince asks...

831
01:00:19,180 --> 01:00:20,180
Are you nervous?

832
01:00:20,180 --> 01:00:29,180
I don't think I'm going to actually be able to get one out this time.

833
01:00:29,180 --> 01:00:35,180
Is that what the prince said?

834
01:00:35,180 --> 01:00:36,180
Yeah.

835
01:00:36,180 --> 01:00:37,180
The prince says...

836
01:00:37,180 --> 01:00:39,180
The prince said I don't actually think I'll be able to get one out this time?

837
01:00:39,180 --> 01:00:40,180
The prince says...

838
01:00:40,180 --> 01:00:41,180
Wait, wait, wait.

839
01:00:41,180 --> 01:00:42,180
What category is that in, Griffin?

840
01:00:42,180 --> 01:00:43,180
Okay.

841
01:00:43,180 --> 01:00:48,180
To be clear, Griffin McElroy, a brother, is not saying that he can't get one out this

842
01:00:48,180 --> 01:00:49,180
time.

843
01:00:49,180 --> 01:00:52,180
Griffin found this funny Yahoo answers request where someone...

844
01:00:52,180 --> 01:00:53,180
Where the prince...

845
01:00:53,180 --> 01:00:54,180
You know what I mean?

846
01:00:54,180 --> 01:00:55,180
The prince said...

847
01:00:55,180 --> 01:00:59,980
The prince asks, would you be mad if I couldn't get one out this time?

848
01:00:59,980 --> 01:01:02,820
And I do need to know the category that was listed under Griffin.

849
01:01:02,820 --> 01:01:15,380
That was listed under fun and games, subcategory religion.

850
01:01:15,380 --> 01:01:17,740
This was recorded on International Podcast Day.

851
01:01:17,740 --> 01:01:18,740
No.

852
01:01:18,740 --> 01:01:19,740
My name is Justin McElroy.

853
01:01:19,740 --> 01:01:20,740
I'm Travis McElroy.

854
01:01:20,740 --> 01:01:21,740
I'm Griffin McElroy.

855
01:01:21,740 --> 01:01:24,100
This has been my brother, my brother, me.

856
01:01:24,100 --> 01:01:25,740
Happy International Podcast Day.

857
01:01:25,740 --> 01:01:55,340
Kiss your dad's grown lips.

858
01:01:55,740 --> 01:02:05,140
Kiss your dad's grown lips.
