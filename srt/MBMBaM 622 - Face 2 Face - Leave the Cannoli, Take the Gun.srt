1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,460
The McElroy brothers are not experts and their advice should never be

2
00:00:07,460 --> 00:00:14,780
followed. Oh Travis insists he's a sexpert but if there's a degree on his

3
00:00:14,780 --> 00:00:22,040
wall balcony I haven't seen it. Also this show isn't for kids which I mentioned

4
00:00:22,040 --> 00:00:28,560
only so the babies out there know how cool they are for listening. What's up

5
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:31,920
you cool baby!

6
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:21,360
It's better, it's better with you. My life. It's better, it's better with you. This is true. It's better, it's better with you. My life. It's better with you.

7
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:25,280
Hello everybody and welcome to my brother my brother and me an advice show for the

8
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:32,960
modern era. I'm your oldest brother Justin Tyler McElroy. I'm your middlest

9
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:46,640
brother Travis Tyler McElroy. And I'm Xavier dark mime Xavier shadow Raven

10
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:57,000
and I'm a I am a sorcerer. You know it's Griffin say never talk about this in the

11
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:01,080
books but like 90% of being a sorcerer is just having the confidence to call

12
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:07,880
yourself a sorcerer. This is Griffin's second night wearing a tuxedo. I will

13
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:16,480
say I will say the cape is new the cape is for you Portland. Well it's not new

14
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:20,360
Griffin borrowed it from our tour manager Amanda. Our business manager

15
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:26,200
Amanda thank you and I will say that the fit is as such that it does make me look

16
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:32,280
like mr. Potter from it's a wonderful life. And it's also impressive because I

17
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:36,120
don't know how he's done this like physically the cape is on the outside

18
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:41,920
then jacket but the cape is connected to the vest underneath the jacket. Sorcerer.

19
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:47,040
Everybody looks great. I don't know I didn't see dad until right before we

20
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:56,080
came out. I do not know. He doesn't run any of that bias by management. It used

21
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:59,800
to be that dad would buy a t-shirt or something at the airport that had like

22
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:05,760
the name of the city we were on and now he's gone. I don't know yeah my favorite

23
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:12,440
part of his intro was when he suggested that he is paid for his services. I saw

24
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:17,080
dad and Travis standing next to each other backstage and it occurred to me it

25
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:22,720
looked like if there was a new Sherlock Holmes movie and you turn it on and then

26
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:29,760
five minutes in they come on the screen and you're like no I don't think so no

27
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:37,040
Did he just say his name is Maury Farty? That's not it. That's not it.

28
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:41,320
Anyway this is an advice show. We're so thrilled to be back here in Portland

29
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:51,840
Oregon. We ordered um we uh how can I how can I you know that spicy lettuce you

30
00:03:51,840 --> 00:04:01,280
guys like yeah you should have we haven't consumed any yeah yeah act two

31
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:09,560
suited and zooted is no no no no don't work cowards there's no way you could

32
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:14,800
have seen us tittering like schoolchildren backstage as we legally

33
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:22,520
purchase recreational drugs it's just me and Travis like look this one's called

34
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:28,520
Obamacare that's pretty good that's hilarious I like anything that sounds

35
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:32,960
like the name of a cream song you know it's just like soda pop dreams and I'm

36
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:37,360
like yeah that's my thing I want to go to sleep ten minutes after the show's

37
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:44,200
done it's it couldn't possibly be harder to choose like I'm looking at them and

38
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:49,240
they're like this one's fucking chock full of resin and I'm like yeah yes yes

39
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:55,360
good and then I start thinking like is that too much resin for me can I handle

40
00:04:55,360 --> 00:05:00,720
that level of resin it's resin like wax what's resin it's demoralizing on

41
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:07,760
purpose to keep the squares out I I purchased weed in Texas a few times

42
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:13,440
which I can say now cuz I don't live there anymore yeah good luck getting

43
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:20,760

52
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:06,280
maybe this is the one where we just second act come out bombed out of our

53
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:19,240
mind listen stop you think you'd think right at least one third of us though by

54
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:24,480
which I mean me would be so paranoid and weird I would say something and you guys

55
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:30,720
would laugh and I'd be like why are you laughing what did I do this is an advice

56
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:37,320
show and we have emerged here in Portland like our friends the Chilean

57
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:42,480
miners who dug their way out of the ground with their own bare hands and

58
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:45,880
they don't talk about that enough when they tell that story they burrowed out

59
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:49,560
of the ground with their own bare hands yeah and then they saw their shadows

60
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:54,040
that went back and it was six more weeks of winter to this we're gonna help you

61
00:06:54,040 --> 00:07:00,000
now are you ready to be helped we're gonna fix this town may I so many of you

62
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:05,840
I really hate it very nice um may I please unbutton the vest please yeah

63
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:11,640
let's take a vote oh wait yes

64
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:22,680
erotic erotic there we go let it breathe okay today I saw my pups breeder on an

65
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:30,200
episode of judge Judy I learned I knew that the breeder was having issues with

66
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:34,920
another breeder around dog ownership I mean I didn't think they're arguing

67
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:41,100
over the rights to the matrix assumed but I didn't know the details how can I

68
00:07:41,100 --> 00:07:45,800
casually bring up that I saw the episode and would love to know more I grew up

69
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:49,180
watching judge Judy with my mom and would love to get some details about the

70
00:07:49,180 --> 00:07:52,960
judge we all grew up watching just Judy with our mom that goes without saying it

71
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:57,000
seems a little insensitive to ask the episode was from last year and the

72
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:00,040
ruling was a little bit of a mixed result that's from pondering pup owner

73
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:06,480
in Portland are you here all right I love welcome the concern that it's

74
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:12,200
insensitive to talk about the private matter of them being well it sounds it

75
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:19,160
sounds like they got their ass beat no it's a mixed it's a mixed result which

76
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:28,640
is always what you want in court I am I listen I say this at 80% of my cases

77
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:32,960
both sides were in the wrong let's just come together now get out of here

78

80
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:48,640
breeder saw judge Judy for the exact same number of seconds as you saw judge

81
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:54,440
Judy on television I guarantee judge Judy had five episodes of film that day

82
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:58,760

be asked about their time on judge Judy yeah you guys know hey this will be a

92
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:52,840
very specific reference but I bet there's a few you guys know anybody

terrible in jeopardy okay do they want to talk about anything else because the

94

people I know they've been on jeopardy make sure you know they've been on

95
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:06,800
jeopardy yeah the idea that you would ask like hey I saw your episode of judge

don't understand I signed an NDA for the thing they aired on television and also

98
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,560
I love this because it encouraged me hearing the thing of like how often we

99
00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:29,480
get asked how to casually ask something like you beg hey so saw you won you know

100
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:34,160
like just say like I saw the episode of judge Judy you don't have to be casual

00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:40,400
be excited yeah I don't believe judge Judy has the power of subpoena yeah I

102

123
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:36,040
tucking in my shirt I'm in my 30s so I guess I've never thought about it before

124
00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:39,440
but do you think when we start reading these questions at live shows someone in

125
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:44,800
the audience goes start talking in my shirt that's me I'm the shirt Tucker I

126
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:50,400
love when they dub over Samuel Jackson when he's like you sure

127
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:58,200
thanks get these shirts off this mother tucking plane I recently started tucking

128
00:12:58,200 --> 00:13:02,800
in my shirt I'm in my 30s so I guess it was just time yes however I work in

129
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:08,280
construction and all the bending down and moving around pulls my shirt out of

130
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:14,080
my pants constantly you doing backflips in order to retuck my shirt I have to

131
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:19,120
loosen my belt and stick my hands down my pants yeah which is a weird look when

132
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:22,920
people catch me with my pants undone while I'm working on their kitchen

133
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:27,840
countertops or whatever oh cuz it's like you're enjoying your genitals you could

134
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:32,400
have found a more tasteful place to fix yourself to get yourself you step over

135
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:36,020
into a corner you face the corner and you do your business and hope no one

136
00:13:36,020 --> 00:13:40,760
sees but if they do they'll think at least he's politely masturbating is

137
00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:48,040
there anything I can say to people when I'm elbow deep in my car hearts not that

138
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:54,000
though well I was elbow deep in my car hearts on a Friday night looking for

139
00:13:54,000 --> 00:14:01,460
loving my car hearts on the banks of the Chattahoochee in the back of my truck

140
00:14:01,460 --> 00:14:05,640
bed with my hands in my car hearts but they weren't the only hands if you know

141
00:14:05,640 --> 00:14:11,240
what I mean yes ghost hands like in Ghostbusters one you guys ever seen that

142
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:16,200
it's weird am I right how could they make a new Ghostbusters and not have

143
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:23,240
Slimer in it come on guys Slimer doesn't get anybody off

144
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:34,880
are you ready for some football it'd be cool if that ghost kept calling him

145
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:40,880
through the whole movie like hey I just never heard from you and that's where

146
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:49,400
the term ghosted comes from yeah so that deserved better no it did guys crushed it

147
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:52,480
is there anything I could say to people when I'm elbow deep in my car hearts to

148
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:56,600
justify or gloss over the situation just saying I'm tucking in my shirt

149
00:14:56,600 --> 00:15:05,240
feels a little if your voice breaks I'm almost finished I'm 41 years old I don't

150
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:09,680
know I'm Greg Brady in every okay just saying I'm tucking in my shirt feels a

151
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:16,000
little he doth protest too much that's from tucking troubles into Portland and

152
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:20,000
it says here alliteration is not my strong suit are neither it seems is

153
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:31,400
discretion what are you are you here God bless you I got it you ready for

154
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:38,760
this yeah you're gonna need to sew your shirt into your underpants excellent

155
00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:46,160
that's really good so your shirt to your underpants and make a velcro front so

156
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:50,800
you can just rip it up there you go and then every time you reach up to install

157
00:15:50,800 --> 00:16:00,160
a countertop hinge or whatever you'd be like I'm ripping myself at half no

158
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:08,160
surprise hugs that is as far as I can hug right now suits are not made for a

159
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:17,320
hugging this is why business dads are so distant the dad in Mary Poppins was a

160
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:24,480
great dad mr. Banks can't physically hug his children so he makes up all these

161
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:31,280
excuses that he has to hire someone in petticoats to hug his children that's

162
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:39,720
how restrictive his tuxedo is he's sewn into it sewn into it every morning did I

163
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:46,200
mean a bet belt a belt doesn't hold the shirt and holds the pants up now it just

164
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:52,360
gets in your way when you need to fix it maybe what about like an elastic belt

165
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:56,520
where there's some tension there great okay that and then what about longer

166
00:16:56,520 --> 00:17:02,120
shirt what about really really really long shirt oh yeah Scrooge that shit

167
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:06,600
yeah Scrooge it up and then at night with sleepy time you light your candle

168
00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:11,240
you have a bit of potato soup loving it you learn a lot about love put on your

169
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:18,400
tassel cap and slip on off to dreamland it'd be beautiful I have great news for

170
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:25,320
you anytime anyone has ever been in my home to do any work whatsoever impressing

171
00:17:25,320 --> 00:17:31,700
them is my number one priority I I've actually not letting them know how

172
00:17:31,700 --> 00:17:37,880
ignorant I am of what they're doing and making them I can't think of another

173
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:43,840
word other than proud of me yeah I've been meaning to ask you both do you do

174
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:47,480
this thing when someone comes into your house to fix something do you ratchet up

175
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:54,280
your West Virginia accent yeah I do say like yeah man I don't know I don't know

176
00:17:54,280 --> 00:17:59,880
what's happening yeah I also checked that yeah to build on Justin's point I

177
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:06,360
think the answer is whenever you are caught adjusting yourself and if they

178
00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:09,960
have the audacity to say something along the lines of like what are you doing

179
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:16,800
just look back at them and be like this is part of it do you do you want these

180
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:25,200
countertops installed or do you want to hinges on these counters or not how are

181
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:31,240
you gonna get to the sink if I don't put hinges on these counters when is a good

182
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:37,380
time to tell this girl I've been talking to that I've released an acapella album

183
00:18:37,380 --> 00:18:42,960
what's the right time track for don't get oh you're liking this I'm enjoying

184
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:49,840
this a well surprise check this out oh that's right

185
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:55,560
you made an acapella track but you just did the backing yeah I couldn't find

186
00:18:55,560 --> 00:18:59,520
anybody else to sing with me but you get like how the rest of it would go I do

187
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:07,680
all the what don't get me wrong I love when that member of Rockapella went on a

188
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:14,640
solo career don't get me wrong acapella is pretty cool thus the album yeah but

189
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:20,520
telling someone about it nah nah nah that's more abrasive than selling your

190
00:19:20,520 --> 00:19:26,200
saying you're a SoundCloud rapping career when if at all should I tell her

191
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:30,920
that's from Connor are you should are you here Connor all right

192
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:36,840
that's perfect what was that like a bee for sure you

193
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:44,520
definitely should at some point yeah oh man it'll come out at Connor Connor

194
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:52,920
Connor Connor Connor be honest is it good hell yeah yeah says Connor I actually

195
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:57,920
I actually have a little bit of life experience with this many years ago we

196
00:19:57,920 --> 00:20:03,120
were in Portland here and we got high on drugs and decide we're gonna get into

197
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:13,280
trolls too in part of the recording of that podcast we would frequently feature

198
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:21,240
our toughest nails means mean mean guy in a different time period gangster yeah

199
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:24,760
he's like a really mean guy and his name is Joel Begleiter and he's our agent

200
00:20:24,760 --> 00:20:29,600
you know he's not mean he's just a tough guy and we found this just tougher than

201
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:37,040
us and he's got he did he was in an acapella group in college called the

202
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:42,840
Brown Derby's right and we found down Easter Alexa by the Brown Derby's if you

203
00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:46,520
could find that on Spotify in which he was the lead soloist he was the lead

204
00:20:46,520 --> 00:20:51,440
soloist and we were so jazzed to find this because we were like we fucking got

205
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:56,000
a crack in the armor we finally got a crack in Joel's armor and then we were

206
00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:00,080
like Joel guess what dog we got you and he was like did you listen to it we're

207
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:07,040
like yeah and he was like it's pretty good right we're like yeah it's like

208
00:21:07,040 --> 00:21:10,960
yeah so it's pretty cool that I did that I guess we were a great group and I was

209
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:17,640
like yeah I guess it was pretty yeah Joel you got us and that's you wait you

210
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:31,400
got to listen listen here Joel's gonna sue us now right so good it's

211
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:37,520
infuriatingly good does everyone shut up

212
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:53,040
thank you Paul thank you God it's good I think if you lay down some sick shit

213
00:21:53,040 --> 00:21:56,880
like that yeah play it next time she gets in the car I think you do have to

214
00:21:56,880 --> 00:22:02,080
play it first because if someone told me I made an acapella album and now I'm

215
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:06,840
gonna play it for you oh boy I would need a fucking Texas Instruments

216
00:22:06,840 --> 00:22:14,160
graphing calculator to figure out my facial expression I could not no way no

217
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:17,760
how could I have the right face for listening to that but if you're already

218
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:22,160
listening to it you're like this is good yeah I like this Connor here's my advice

219
00:22:22,160 --> 00:22:26,560
you're gonna walk into this backwards you're going to be like whatever the

220
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:30,920
conversation is if it's about like you know projects you've worked on hobbies

221
00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:36,340
you've had whatever you can say like well yeah I one time you know I put

222
00:22:36,340 --> 00:22:40,640
together an acapella album and they're like you did and I get pretty good they

223
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:44,160
are inevitably going to ask to listen to it and you're like I mean I guess we

224
00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:50,000
could which at that point it's great but if you went into it saying I'm going to

225
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:54,960
play this but you can't do that no no the next few seconds between that

226
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:59,360
announcement until you press the play button are going to be the worst seconds

227
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:05,040
of their life and here's the thing trust me from experience please don't try to

228
00:23:05,040 --> 00:23:11,880
stream it because I guarantee oh god it will play two seconds and just wait

229
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:14,840
hold on it's just buffering hold on one second oh no I think oh there's some

230
00:23:14,840 --> 00:23:18,120
gonna hold on wait the Bluetooth isn't it it's only coming through the left so

231
00:23:18,120 --> 00:23:23,840
you're only getting hold on let me go get my big speakers hold on I swear I

232
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:28,800
charge this beforehand Paul was oh Paul wanted us to mention that he used to be

233
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:31,840
in an acapella group called da Vinci's notebook if you've never heard their

234
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:35,440
shoehorn with well they're selling it they just don't get together anymore you

235
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:39,760
don't leave an acapella band you've probably heard them because you

236
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:45,480
downloaded a line wire or Kazaa version of shoehorn with teeth that said it was

237
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:49,200
by moxie fruvis and it turned out it was actually by Paul yeah so that's where

238
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:56,000
what a pleasant surprise yeah what a treat for you another question

239
00:23:56,000 --> 00:24:08,160
we got a haunted doll watch okay okay no sorry

240
00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:15,080
ironically I was watching Ghostbusters afterlife backstage let me just move

241
00:24:15,080 --> 00:24:21,360
over to crowns Travis watches movies so that he can tell you how he doesn't like

242
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:27,160
them yeah a lot guys I've heard Travis Travis has been watching Ghostbusters

243
00:24:27,160 --> 00:24:32,080
afterlife for four days and I have I have ADHD yeah I've heard four

244
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:38,000
different reviews of the film based on how much he has watched yeah so he's

245
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:41,240
like so I watched the first 20 minutes of this movie and it's like let me tell

246
00:24:41,240 --> 00:24:45,720
you what I think and then he has done that to me three other times like so

247
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:49,600
I'm 75 minutes in and here's where I'm at yeah I didn't want to hear about it

248
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:56,760
at all my experience changes as the movie goes on boy you are seriously

249
00:24:56,760 --> 00:25:00,040
looking like something on your phone yeah it's got me really worried no don't

250
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:09,480
worry about it don't worry about it okay so I this is my version upon a doll and

251
00:25:09,480 --> 00:25:23,560
whenever I do a bit I like to gamify it so I like to call this the doll is right

252
00:25:23,560 --> 00:25:28,760
okay okay so here's what's gonna happen I will describe the dog and you'll see

253
00:25:28,760 --> 00:25:35,600
the pictures and then you guys are gonna guess the price of the dog good Paul

time she will give you vivid dreams always come to me during meditation whoa

259
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:18,640
the scale is so different from what I thought it was the first couple looked

260
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:23,960
like a doll and now it's on some firm gully shit and is very responsive to

261
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:30,400
any way you would like to communicate I don't need that she can be very

262
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:36,080
mischievous and likes to be spoiled her favorite thing is to hide small items no

263
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:40,720
worries I have always been able to find whatever she is hidden because she

264
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:47,340
didn't hide them because she's a doll yeah I will send a candle herbs from my

265

269
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:17,040

Facebook Instagram and tik-tok quote a collaboration between Old Spice and

458
00:47:40,800 --> 00:47:50,080
Arby's makes all the sense in the world oh you can say whatever the fuck you

Griffin yeah something something smells like a like lavender on a hot dog yes it

463
00:48:13,800 --> 00:48:18,280
makes all the sense in the world to hilariously solve the age-old problem of

464
00:48:18,280 --> 00:48:27,240
the notorious meat so they also define sweat listen it's very you imagine

465
00:48:27,240 --> 00:48:33,480
buying this kit and not knowing what meat sweats is I'm just a big old twice

466
00:48:33,480 --> 00:48:36,760
head I'm really glad there's a clock on the stage right now because I feel like

467
00:48:36,760 --> 00:48:40,920
I've been thinking about Arby's for about an hour and a half okay it makes

468
00:48:40,920 --> 00:48:44,920
all the sense of the world to hilariously solve the age-old problem of

469
00:48:44,920 --> 00:48:51,600
the notorious meat sweats that we've all faced at some point in our lives yeah we

470
00:48:51,600 --> 00:48:56,000
all remember the first time we faced meat sweats in our life that's from all

471
00:48:56,000 --> 00:49:00,920
sweat is meat sweat if you think about it oh my god that's deep grip old spice

humor and unexpected partnerships that remind them of the importance of

474
00:49:11,880 --> 00:49:18,560
long-lasting protection even if they've just eaten a half pound roast beef do

475
00:49:18,560 --> 00:49:22,000
you think at some point the roast beef say the half pound roast beef sandwich

476
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:27,160
is like okay I love all those for sure this is all so funny if we can pick

477
00:49:27,160 --> 00:49:31,840
other sandwiches the highlight that also provide the meat sweats that would be so

478
00:49:31,840 --> 00:49:35,800
choice for me like if you say all of our products then it just sounds you're

479
00:49:35,800 --> 00:49:43,840
having a bit of fun this sounds accusatory targeted at me a sandwich the

480
00:49:43,840 --> 00:49:47,240
mountainous half pound roast beef sandwich isn't the only place the old

481
00:49:47,240 --> 00:49:53,720
spice has been lately what beef tastic brouhaha began this past week when the

482
00:49:53,720 --> 00:49:58,340
old spice guy made his presence known on the streets of New York handing out sweat

483
00:49:58,340 --> 00:50:04,920
defense dry sprays Arby's gift cards and these meat sweat defense kits it's like

484
00:50:04,920 --> 00:50:14,080
if someone handed you an antidote and then was like and also here is poison

485
00:50:14,080 --> 00:50:20,400
decked out in an old spice and Arby's SUV which I assume will be in my

486
00:50:20,400 --> 00:50:25,940
driveway at some point through hooker through crook the old spice guy even

487
00:50:25,940 --> 00:50:31,360
ended up in the meatpacking district to tell them that Arby's has the meats and

488
00:50:31,360 --> 00:50:36,680
they said no you don't actually we know we pack them here and send it to you

489
00:50:36,680 --> 00:50:41,520
you have some of the meats what you can't claim all the meats whether you

490
00:50:41,520 --> 00:50:46,260
are eating a meat mountain or a half pound roast beef sandwich or just a

491
00:50:46,260 --> 00:50:51,360
nasty boy Arby's is thrilled that our guests have access to this innovative

492
00:50:51,360 --> 00:50:57,200
solution that helps them fully enjoy the meats while avoiding the sweats we are

493
00:50:57,200 --> 00:51:03,240
big fans of old spice products and creativity and it was a no-brainer to

494
00:51:03,240 --> 00:51:07,200
have a little fun with them on this program if I'm Jim Taylor Arby's

495
00:51:07,200 --> 00:51:10,840

00:51:34,280 --> 00:51:42,480
they're there anyway that's the meat sweat defense get that was a journey can

501
00:51:42,480 --> 00:51:49,120
you imagine a brand like deep like absolutely annihilating themselves to

502
00:51:49,120 --> 00:51:54,960
that extent what would it would be like McDonald's started selling you a

503
00:51:54,960 --> 00:52:00,520
co-branded partnership with empty that lets you capture all your farts in a bag

504
00:52:00,520 --> 00:52:05,600
all your everyone knows about McDonald's farts and now you can put them in a bag

505
00:52:05,600 --> 00:52:10,280
every quote from Arby's in that article did sound like it was written at gunpoint

506
00:52:10,280 --> 00:52:18,680
so maybe okay credible hey we we have some questions from you all that we have

507

519
00:53:32,840 --> 00:53:39,040
function yeah bandolier oh yeah absolutely what I'm realizing now is a

520
00:53:39,040 --> 00:53:44,240
lot of my references are from the movie hackers and the TV show reboot yeah and

521
00:53:44,240 --> 00:53:51,520
that one episode of Ghost Rider yeah what do you normally wear well I own a

522
00:53:51,520 --> 00:53:58,000
lot of shirts that are themed after breweries okay yeah if I yeah I could

523
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:05,880
see that on a hacker I say this to your fucking face okay here's you need to get

524
00:54:05,880 --> 00:54:13,760
a t-shirt that says typing noise typing noise typing noise I'm in that's good

525
00:54:13,760 --> 00:54:18,600
can you wear like part of a keyboard on your chest and just occasionally be like

526
00:54:18,600 --> 00:54:23,760
just when they're not really paying attention that could be cool I could

527
00:54:23,760 --> 00:54:29,280
probably get away with it yeah maybe a power glove oh shit and you're like

528
00:54:29,280 --> 00:54:34,960
here you're not making any progress to the ice give me a second do you have and

553
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:21,120
like a movie swap except you don't have to watch the Godfather in the exchange

554
00:57:21,120 --> 00:57:25,000

555
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:30,080
never sharted or something I do like as a point of pride I refuse to watch like

00:58:23,920 --> 00:58:32,360
oh it's a taunting the last person to watch either or the Godfather or die

567
00:58:32,360 --> 00:58:39,200
it's all about it hey listen here's what you do you fuck you'd send him

568
00:58:39,200 --> 00:58:45,120
tick-tocks from the movie Shrek until you've sent him every scene the yeah

569
00:58:45,120 --> 00:58:50,320
legally if he's seen 51% of Shrek he sees Shrek right I get up if I go to

570
00:58:50,320 --> 00:58:53,920
the bathroom during a movie I still say I've seen the movie I got up three times

571
00:58:53,920 --> 00:59:00,200
during top gun maverick cuz I was bored it's not whoa it's not it's not the

572
00:59:00,200 --> 00:59:07,400
movie it's me I sat down ten minutes and like oh that's my fault I went and saw

573
00:59:07,400 --> 00:59:12,760
anyway if you say no no Justin please continue on with your full review of top

574
00:59:12,760 --> 00:59:18,560
gun maverick you send him enough tick-tocks to where he's seen 50.0001

575
00:59:18,560 --> 00:59:23,680
percentage but don't spoil the ending oh that's right the twist then he's seen

576
00:59:23,680 --> 00:59:28,660
it was donkey the whole time neither of us have tick-tock what oh okay you

577
00:59:28,660 --> 00:59:35,160
should have warned me about that what is there other places with videos YouTube I

578
00:59:35,160 --> 00:59:39,200
guess you could send him YouTube videos of Shrek until he's probably seen over

579
00:59:39,200 --> 00:59:44,080
half oh you could take notice starting find find check on YouTube and started

580
00:59:44,080 --> 00:59:51,920
with like you got to watch this hilarious video you could you probably

581
00:59:51,920 --> 00:59:56,520
would only need to clear 47 minutes or so if you need that grift go on for 40

582
00:59:56,520 --> 01:00:04,440
you could take Nathan's hacker class and then just drop clips of it in okay does

583
01:00:04,440 --> 01:00:08,120
that does that yeah just every time your partner tries to call their mom it's

584
01:00:08,120 --> 01:00:14,920
right are you do you are you serious about getting out of this because I have

585
01:00:14,920 --> 01:00:20,480

01:02:33,800 --> 01:02:36,720
lesson to you if you ever come to another live show you know like I think

606
01:02:36,720 --> 01:02:43,080
my question will get answered this is the new baron like this is the okay no

607
01:02:43,080 --> 01:02:49,240
pressure Kate oh yeah for sure um so I volunteer at a 4-h county fair every

608
01:02:49,240 --> 01:02:55,680
year I'm the rabbit superintendent and and this year I got to attend and as the

609
01:02:55,680 --> 01:03:01,880
rabbit judge and you were the super attendant and

610
01:03:06,600 --> 01:03:11,400
the problem is is that today was the breed class and I had to judge all these

611
01:03:11,400 --> 01:03:16,400
today yeah so I had to pose them all and you have to go through every animal in

612
01:03:16,400 --> 01:03:21,760
the barn and there was a problem that arose because when you're handling all

613
01:03:21,760 --> 01:03:27,620
of the female rabbits and all of the male rabbits the male rabbits smell the

614
01:03:27,620 --> 01:03:33,240
female rabbit and they start sort of just going to town on your hands arms

615
01:03:33,240 --> 01:03:41,440
body and you hey you've showered since then right yes very very very much I mean

616
01:03:41,440 --> 01:03:46,840
I don't have dirt all over me so you can also tell from that so sorry that you

617
01:03:46,840 --> 01:03:55,520
had to say that actually from now on if you're at if you're at one of our live

618
01:03:55,520 --> 01:03:59,280
shows I would like everyone to just mention I don't have dirt all over me

619
01:03:59,280 --> 01:04:05,040
anyway it's an audio medium if you're listening to this later I do not have

620
01:04:05,040 --> 01:04:10,840
turtle so what I mean the rabbits are getting down is it the problem yeah so

621
01:04:10,840 --> 01:04:15,560
they do completion if I remember they go into completion yes multiple times

622
01:04:15,560 --> 01:04:22,520
throughout the show wait multiple times per rabbit okay it's what rabbits are

623
01:04:22,520 --> 01:04:28,560
known for is how many jizzes they like carrots they like carrots they give me

624
01:04:28,560 --> 01:04:34,960
eggs on Easter there's a lot of clarifying so a lot of other things I

625
01:04:34,960 --> 01:04:40,760
know about rabbit rabbits other than they like to jizz a bunch yeah so

626
01:04:40,760 --> 01:04:45,560
basically I mean there's a whole show circuit and there's like people who do

627
01:04:45,560 --> 01:04:49,040
like judging and stuff I thought you're about to say there's people who walk

628
01:04:49,040 --> 01:04:54,680
them off he can't he can't show right now no one's whacked him off yeah give

629
01:04:54,680 --> 01:05:02,400
me a second hey okay I'm sorry to ask this question I have to know yeah

630
01:05:02,400 --> 01:05:15,440
deeded duck points will that happens or do you add bonus I did I did give all

631
01:05:15,440 --> 01:05:21,800
the rabbits that finished I did end up giving them all blue ribbons I didn't

632
01:05:21,800 --> 01:05:26,440
it's how it worked I didn't deduct points they were all good rabbits what

633
01:05:26,440 --> 01:05:31,560
can I say I hope you were locking this in your memories and amber because no

634
01:05:31,560 --> 01:05:37,960
one will hear it again oh god okay okay so my big question of course I thought

635
01:05:37,960 --> 01:05:48,440
yeah how do I stop the rabbits from jizzing on me yeah for sure for sure

636
01:05:48,440 --> 01:06:06,320
but hold on is there a is there is there a how high does the bunny hop contest

637
01:06:06,320 --> 01:06:11,000
that's not not as a part of this no that's it that's that 4h after hours

638
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:14,840
that's where the bedding began alley what are the can you give me one of the

639
01:06:14,840 --> 01:06:20,120
other criteria that they are judged by it's like a dog breed show so like you

640
01:06:20,120 --> 01:06:27,320
know the good the shape the density okay how do I how dense is the like you like

641
01:06:27,320 --> 01:06:33,400
a you like a thick boy it just you know the body okay not yeah the rabbit the

642
01:06:33,400 --> 01:06:37,640
rabbit if there was a people by the way if you're listening this later there

643
01:06:37,640 --> 01:06:42,000
are people close to us who have physically turned their bodies yeah they

644
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:48,600
are recoiling they're no longer oriented towards us performing they're oriented

645
01:06:48,600 --> 01:06:54,520
away from us to other directions that's good I love that if there was a how high

646
01:06:54,520 --> 01:06:59,720
can the bunny hop contest do you think there would be a judge stopping the

647
01:06:59,720 --> 01:07:04,560
bunnies from hopping so high and saying don't hop so high bunnies well of course

648
01:07:04,560 --> 01:07:12,680
not this is a sorry y'all invented what is essentially a jizzing contest you

649
01:07:12,680 --> 01:07:22,520
cannot we have to stop talking about rabbit jizz now hey hey next time judge

650
01:07:22,520 --> 01:07:30,200

652
01:07:40,040 --> 01:07:49,160
all right um I sent in a question about getting permabanned yeah yeah all right

653
01:07:49,160 --> 01:07:57,040
from the 4-h rabbit show I guess chanting is not oh and how did you get

654
01:07:57,040 --> 01:08:02,320
first what's the name of the bar it's space room it's over on Hawthorne well

655
01:08:02,320 --> 01:08:07,640
hold your horses yeah hold on a second you don't know this tale of what oh and

656
01:08:07,640 --> 01:08:15,640
what happened my birthday was Wednesday and so so I went out and drank with some

657
01:08:15,640 --> 01:08:20,440
of my friends cool ended up at the space room end of the night comes around last

658
01:08:20,440 --> 01:08:25,240
call happens my friend Charlie decides to whip his pants down in the middle of

659
01:08:25,240 --> 01:08:30,440
the bar wait no it's not as bad as you think gone super bad and I end up

660
01:08:30,440 --> 01:08:35,640
getting super fucking and oh and you have to finish with like they mooned you

661
01:08:35,640 --> 01:08:41,280
not just whip their pants down yeah there's two sides okay dumbed it out on

662
01:08:41,280 --> 01:08:46,000
like in front of our table pressed ham mooning okay no this is this is very

663
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:51,520
jumpy now could also I'm just saying this is like a tasteful mooning this is

664
01:08:51,520 --> 01:08:57,640
not the first time he's done this okay yeah this happens in a lot of bars no

665
01:08:57,640 --> 01:09:01,960
he's okay cuz I'm gonna say some mean stuff about wait but that got you

666
01:09:01,960 --> 01:09:07,200
perma-banned the target not perma-banned not you I'm perma-banned

667
01:09:07,200 --> 01:09:11,400
this is what I'm saying that's messed up that's not fair you didn't do anything

668
01:09:11,400 --> 01:09:30,360
I don't hold on did you did you did you laugh though oh of course I did now I

669
01:09:30,360 --> 01:09:34,240
also think the context that it was last call actually should provide some

670
01:09:34,240 --> 01:09:39,720
leniency because that happens at 930 p.m. right that's a perfect 230 in the

671
01:09:39,720 --> 01:09:44,360
morning like yeah we love it I mean did this bar did this bar serve Charlie yes

672
01:09:44,360 --> 01:09:49,480
you could make the argument then that they are culpable right like you gave

673
01:09:49,480 --> 01:09:53,960
this person so much boost that they're mooning people you got a kind of you

674
01:09:53,960 --> 01:10:01,400
provided windows right I how do you get perma-banned have you tried to just walk

675

685
01:11:00,480 --> 01:11:06,000
just Judy I'm starting to think it's the yeah I think it might be the

686
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:10,400
appropriate venue she would love to get her hands on this one yeah all right so

687
01:11:10,400 --> 01:11:14,080
let me get this straight hold on let me put down my pretzels let me get this

688
01:11:14,080 --> 01:11:17,840

01:11:28,040 --> 01:11:34,080
judge Judy Owen do you like the bar I do okay sounds like a cool bar the way

692
01:11:34,080 --> 01:11:39,120
everybody cheered at it wait a minute there are definitely worse things that

693
01:11:39,120 --> 01:11:44,360
have happened there too can this be one of these times where we abuse our power

694
01:11:44,360 --> 01:11:50,080
as tastemakers and so if you go into this bar just be like you should really

695
01:11:50,080 --> 01:11:56,160
