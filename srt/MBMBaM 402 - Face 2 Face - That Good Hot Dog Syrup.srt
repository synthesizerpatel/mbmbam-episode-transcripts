1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:30,800
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:49,360
How close do you think you came to just eating? You just almost ate so much shit.

6
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:51,680
Almost ate it. That would have been so bad.

7
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:59,360
But it did something for Kelsey Grammer, right? We all remember when he ate shit famously off

8
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:06,000
that one stage. Next year, Finding Neverland called him up. Hey, are you Fraser and also

9
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:12,080
the guy who ate shit off that one stage? Love that, dude. Real good. Do you think if you'd

10
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:16,240
fallen off the stage, Fraser would have called you and said, hey, you're in the club. Welcome

11
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:19,280
to the club. That's not how the show starts. You're right. So hold on.

12
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:25,040
Hello and welcome to my brother, my brother meeting advice show for the modern era. I'm

13
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:36,400
your oldest brother, Justin McElroy. And I'm your middle brother, Travis McElroy.

14
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,080
And I'm your sweet baby brother and 30 under 30 media luminary, Griffin McElroy.

15
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:57,120
I'm sorry for the faces I made during the first 30 seconds or so of us being on stage.

16
00:01:57,120 --> 00:02:07,200
We ate a lot of velvet taco. But the important thing is not how much we ate, I would argue.

17
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:12,160
But in fact, the timeline in which we ate it because it arrived five minutes ago.

18
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:20,800
We slammed it. We have been making noises that are not the traditional toots and burps,

19
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:29,280
but new sounds, exciting sounds from new places. New fresh sounds. If you fill the bagpipe with

20
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:36,160
Jell-O and maybe some Gak from the 90s. We made a glomp. It came from my chest.

21
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:45,280
My elbow made a slurp sound. We had a this is not a joke. We had a pretty serious two minute

22
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:50,160
conversation backstage where we try to think if we can make a bit out of us needing like five

23
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:55,360
minutes just to sit up here while you talk amongst yourselves to digest. And we promised like we'd

24
00:02:55,360 --> 00:03:00,400
like we get you back at the end. We'd go longer. Like we weren't wasting your time. We just needed

25
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:06,960
some time up here. So far here in Dallas, we did the Adventure Zone last night and

26
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:17,040
thank you very much. It's a D&D podcast that we. Well, it's an RPG podcast. But it's been a very

27
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:23,120
eventful two days. So we did the show and also there was like some kind of. There was like a

28
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:30,880
college prom last night, like an SMU formal at our hotel, literally outside my window. And y'all,

29
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:42,800
our nation is facing a crisis. And it's that there hasn't been a party rock anthem released

30
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:50,320
in like eight years because they were playing no joke fucking back to back shots. Yeah. Gangnam

31
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:56,560
style. Yeah. And it's like, are we just done? Did Side Do Gangnam style? And we're like,

32
00:03:56,560 --> 00:04:01,920
that's it. No more party rock. To be fair. Yeah. Oh, they also played party rock.

33
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:09,680
Um, but another night, Joe. So Conight Joe was in there also, which is. Yeah. But what you're

34
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:14,240
wondering about, sometimes dad comes to us before we go on stage. Like when we first arrive in a

35
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:19,440
city, it usually is within the first 12 hours of arriving on the scene. Dad comes to us and he says,

36
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:24,880
Hey, I've got your pre-show bit. And he doesn't say it in those words. He says it with other

37
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:33,040
words. But what we hear is, Hey, good news. Your pre-show bit is settled. Our dad brushed his teeth

38
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:41,920
with capsaicin cream. So what's that? And you don't know capsaicin is a,

39
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:47,200
it's a cream people use for pain relief. And the capsaicin is of course the same chemical in very

40
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:57,760
hot peppers. And here's the thing. When papa told us that I would have equally believed the mistake

41
00:04:57,760 --> 00:05:05,040
or I was curious. Yeah. I wanted to try. I want it. I just wanted to find out. Let me find out.

42
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:08,960
Maybe he did it for his sons who he loves so they can have a good intro bit for podcasts.

43
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:14,480
That would be the only thing to explain why he does it every fucking time. Well, and this is

44
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:19,600
the thing. New creams I should know, not always capsaicin. It's always some different cream. I

45
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:27,200
think that this is very insightful to see like the, the chain from our dad to us because how it works,

46
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:33,440
your story goes in here. So dad will do something embarrassing and then tell us in an embarrassed

47
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:38,720
way, but then get a funny reaction to it. And eventually he's bragging about it to people.

48
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:43,200
Where he'll say like, I don't tell people about how I brush my teeth with capsaicin.

49
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:46,400
It's actually very instructive in your own life. If you have shame,

50
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:52,400
try to own it like our dad does. Yeah. Our dad's like, if our dad fucks up super bad,

51
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:56,560
he feels bad about it. And by the end of the week, he's like, could we do a t-shirt of this

52
00:05:56,560 --> 00:06:02,800
bad thing that I did? This bad fuck up that I fucked up. It's a good launch pad for your children's

53
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:06,880
careers too. I don't even know if he was thinking about it that way. For instance, 20 years ago when

54
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:11,520
he cut his butt wide open with a window scream and had to duct tape it shut with a maxi pad.

55
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:16,800
I don't know if he was thinking about it when he did it like, oh, they're going to love this though.

56
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:22,480
I don't know if he was thinking about it when he held a huge tray of cold cuts and a truck

57
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:28,000
drove past him so close that it hit him with the side view mirror and sent fucking ham flying

58
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:34,800
everywhere. Now I know what you're asking. Where was he? How close do you have to be to have cold

59
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:40,640
cuts and truck? I think it was just like at the park. Who was in the wrong place? The truck or

60
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:45,120
our dad? I have a very clear memory of being like 12 years old and driving to the hospital

61
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:49,760
and a lady that dad worked with was praying over him and I can very much remember thinking,

62
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:57,040
he does not deserve that. Ma'am, please do not bother God with this, okay? What happened?

63
00:06:57,040 --> 00:07:03,360
The truck and cold cut. That is the first time I've heard that one. That was me. I'm trying to

64
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:12,080
launch a comedy podcast up here. See you in 20 years, boys. Wait, what? What? So anyway, we do-

65
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:17,440
We are going to be making a ham delivery tomorrow and get hit by one big truck and it'll be a

66
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:22,160
beautiful karmic moment. So as you've almost certainly guessed, we do an advice show. Untraditional,

67
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:26,080
but you want to start with the Yahoo? I do want to start with the Yahoo. This one was

68
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:34,320
This one was sent in by Merit Palmer. Thank you, Merit. It's Yahoo Answers User? Question mark?

69
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:40,480
But not like it's not loading properly. That's their fucking name. That's what they've gone with.

70
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:47,760
Question mark asks, I have an idea for a syrup. How can I go about selling it commercially?

71
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:56,080
You've heard of maple syrup. Have you heard of weeping willow syrup? It's a new ex- It doesn't

72
00:07:56,080 --> 00:08:02,880
have syrup in it. How did you- I squeezed it so hard. I don't even think this person has gotten

73
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:08,480
to the production stage. Yeah. It sounds like what they have done and said, I know a flavor I like

74
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:16,240
is tomatoes. I know I love the viscosity of syrup. How can I bring these two things together?

75
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:24,240
There's that one weeping willow- Honey, honey, wake up. I've done it. Stone syrup. What? Stone

76
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:29,520
syrup. What's the most expensive substance on earth? Diamonds. I'd like to talk to you today.

77
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:36,000
It looks like Mark is going to be a good guy. He's going to be a good guy.

78
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:41,360
It looks like Mark's out. He does not want to invest in diamond syrup.

79
00:08:43,040 --> 00:08:50,400
I have a new idea for syrup. Have we not explored all of the syrup that there is? Apparently not.

80
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:56,560
Because here's the thing, if this is just like add flavor to it like blueberry, it's maple syrup,

81
00:08:56,560 --> 00:09:01,040
but with blueberry in it, that's nothing. That's nothing. I can do that. We're all doing our own

82
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:07,280
flavor experiments at home with syrup all the time. What is this new syrup that's going to

83
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:15,600
change the fucking game? Maybe it's not the flavor. It is the practical use case of the syrup.

84
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:22,880
Engine syrup. Engine syrup. Make your car go zoom. Make your car sweet. Sweet operation on this car.

85
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:28,640
Edible. Edible engine syrup. Finally. Any time- You ever pour motor oil in your car and think,

86
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:35,440
fuck, that looks good? Listen, we've all been there. Now it's engine syrup we've rebranded.

87
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:45,680
Can we frame it so that your car is a hungry mouth and then all the stuff you put into it

88
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:53,120
is food for car? Listen, we got engine syrup. We got go soup. We got it all. We got bottom donuts.

89
00:09:53,120 --> 00:10:03,200
What are tires? Yes. Okay. I call those bottom donuts now. That sounds deeply sexual. Yes. Yes.

90
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:07,600
That's part of the appeal. It's going to make it pop on the aisle of the Pep Boys. That's very on

91
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:14,080
trend with millennials. We need tires. These bottom donuts cost $200 more than the tires.

92
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:20,880
That's right. They're so sexual. I know you meant like A-I-S-L-E of the Pep Boys,

93
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:29,440
but what I heard was aisle of the Pep Boys. Welcome to Pep Boys aisle. Can you survive?

94
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:33,280
There's three of us and one of you. Do the math.

95
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:40,160
How about a question? The problem with new syrup. Okay.

96
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:48,000
If you're saying what the name of it is, it's going to be confusing if it goes on that thing

97
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:53,040
or not. Maple syrup, no one thinks, oh, I'm going to put syrup on a maple. That doesn't make any

98
00:10:53,040 --> 00:11:01,440
sense. What? Hot dog syrup is like- Oh, shit. Is this flavored like a hot dog in syrup form

99
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:08,000
or is this syrup for my hot dog? That's the biggest problem with hot dog syrup. I absolutely agree.

100
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:12,320
Yeah. No matter which way that cookie crumbles, it's going to be a hard pass.

101
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:21,920
Yes. It's going to be a firm no. What if it's good?

102
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:30,000
You didn't tell me it was good hot dog syrup.

103
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:34,720
No, it's obviously good hot dog syrup. Does that mean the hot dog syrup is good

104
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:39,600
or that it was expressed from good hot dog? If the hot dog syrup isn't good,

105
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:43,920
why is Mark Cuban giving me all this money? He loves it.

106
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:54,160
Here's a question from somebody here. Recently, my boyfriend started up a blogging platform

107
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:59,760
for reviewing pizza from local establishments. Everything from the info pages to the username

108
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:05,280
are pizza themed. The problem is he doesn't review the pizza, but instead reviews the

109
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:09,760
establishment's features and amenities such as the civil ware, table mats, and bathrooms.

110
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:15,360
He usually concludes the review with a single sentence about the pizza.

111
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:19,360
Yep. Usually something brief and simple like the margarita pizza was okay.

112
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:25,520
How do I help him improve his platform's reach and review quality while hinting to him

113
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:30,400
that not even trying to review the pizza he eats at different locations is probably not the best

114
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:37,600
idea? That's from Frustrated and Flower Mound. Are you here? Okay, wait. Hold on. Hello. Thank you

115
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:41,040
for coming. Thank you. Thank you for being here. Thank you for buying a ticket. Thank you for

116
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:48,400
sending in a question. I do have to ask, is boyfriend here? Okay. This fucking kills me,

117
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:55,840
so I guess you found a way to tell him, huh? Fuck. You're just going to fucking enlist me

118
00:12:55,840 --> 00:13:04,880
in your struggles, okay? What I got here is step one. Now he had to hear it from his all-time hero,

119
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:11,440
okay? Great. It's the opposite of hitting a home run for the sick kid in the hospital.

120
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:16,240
This is the opposite. It's hitting it, but it smashes through the window and hits the sick kid

121
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:19,680
because everybody else is going to love the great home run. Except for that one.

122
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:28,480
You have one crazy long hair. Are you seeing this shit? Whoa. Holy shit. Don't derail the show.

123
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:40,480
They're not going to be able to enjoy that. Get it out. Get it out. It was so long. Here's the

124
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:52,000
thing. Question asker, you are wrong. Sorry. Sorry. And boyfriend blogger is right. It sounds

125
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:56,720
great. Honestly, it sounds great. Because that's all I want. When I go on Yelp, I don't care about

126
00:13:56,720 --> 00:14:04,240
the fucking food. Charles Dickens could write a book called A Tale of Three Pizzas in which he

127
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:09,440
takes 600 pages to describe the three most lovely pizzas he's ever eaten. That's not going to put

128
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:16,560
the fucking pizza in my mouth, Charles. All I need is one sentence that's just, is it good or is it

129
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:23,440
okay or is it bad? And then if you want to dedicate a whole blog post to, for instance, do the locks

130
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:30,000
on the bathroom doors work properly, now you're in my fucking wheelhouse. Not only do they fucking

131
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:33,600
work, but does it look like they've put six different lock options and only one of them works?

132
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:38,640
I don't trust that shit. Only one of them works? This is all I think about any time I go. I scope

133
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:44,320
out the B room and I make sure that it's good for me. Six locks and only one of them works?

134
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:50,880
What makes me think that sixth one is not going to give out during my tenure? That actually,

135
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:54,960
we're going to get back to this in one second. I did want to briefly derail. Right before the show,

136
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:59,040
I walked out. There's a long hall away from our dressing room that goes to the bathroom

137
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:04,480
and there was a security guard sitting in the hall. So don't fucking try anything. Nice try.

138
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:12,800
And as I passed him, I'm sort of, I don't know what to, I always feel indebted. Like thank you

139
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:18,240
for, thank you for your service, for protecting my life. So I give him like a, I told, I actually

140
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:22,720
told him I just ate too many tacos. And then I was going, I went to the bathroom and the bathroom

141
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:29,280
didn't have a lock on it. And then I was like, well, I don't know what to do. And then I was

142
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:36,160
like, well, there's that security guard. And it's not exactly clear what he's guarding,

143
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:41,440
but if he's trying to guard me and your treasure and my sort of continued existence,

144
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:50,080
I did go back out and ask him like, if you do see anybody, if anybody, if anybody's coming this way,

145
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:54,960
just give him a heads up. Cause I have no lock. I don't think he said, yeah, why do you think I'm

146
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:59,520
here? That's why I'm here, Justin. Don't worry about it. To guard your bathroom experience. Yeah, dude. I know.

147
00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:06,560
I know. Yeah, dude. Don't tell me how to do my job. When I'm looking up restaurant reviews,

148
00:16:07,280 --> 00:16:13,040
all I care about is like, I need a whole review that's just like, you won't regret coming here.

149
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:17,920
And I don't mean the food. I mean you, Travis McElroy, will feel like you've made the right choice.

150
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:28,240
The right choice. Oh boy. If you could have it in review whether or not there is check candy.

151
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:36,240
So you know going in that you're going to get check candy. Would you want that? I think I would. But wait.

152
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:44,000
Isn't that a spoiler? Isn't that very exciting? One of the few joys of adult life

153
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:49,280
when the check comes, you're like, oh, but then there's like an Andes mint. So you're like, okay.

154
00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:55,040
Oh, but it could also be. Free food. Nice. I guess I got one over on you. Well, I guess I will be

155
00:16:55,040 --> 00:17:03,040
having dessert tonight. Yeah. Unless. Unless. It's one of those green mints and you don't know whether

156
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:11,680
it's tropical flavored or spearmint. No stars. Great ambiance. Pizza's the best I've ever eaten.

157
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:17,840
They gave me one of those tricky mints. I will tell you what would give me a no star review right off

158
00:17:17,840 --> 00:17:23,520
the bat. No clear indication as to whether I should ask for the check or walk up and pay at the counter.

159
00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:31,520
That is a that is a no star review for me right there. I can't. I've sat at a table for 20 minutes

160
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:36,800
because there's nothing worse than the fear of like just going up to somebody like here is this

161
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:43,440
is this for you? Are you an adult? Are you? Can you handle this? I just want to go fix for me.

162
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:50,960
Thanks for Justin. Here is money. Justin give money. You let leave. And have you ever noticed

163
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:55,440
that when you do get it wrong and you try to give your waitress some money, they will fucking

164
00:17:55,440 --> 00:18:01,120
destroy every time they are so pleased to be able to say, oh no, no, no, no, no. You're gonna have

165
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:09,680
to march up there and face what you did alone and buy some chiclets too. I have a yahoo here.

166
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:15,040
This one was uh sent in by Adrian Cowles. Thank you Adrian. Sent in a ton of good ones. Thank you.

167
00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:25,680
It's from cool cat 4567. Who had to whose fucking house was on fire but they just had to pick a yahoo

168
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:34,160
name real fast. Cool cat 4567. Cool cat's taking shit. Get the dog. I'm a cool cat. What else matters?

169
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:42,880
I touched a supposedly haunted piano that didn't know was haunted. Am I screwed?

170
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:53,520
Okay wait. Read it one more time. Yeah there's something. I touched I touched a supposedly

171
00:18:53,520 --> 00:19:00,080
haunted piano comma that didn't know was haunted comma am I screwed? Are they saying

172
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:07,040
is this another hot dog syrup situation? No are they saying the piano didn't know it was haunted?

173
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:12,480
Like the piano is haunted but the piano is not aware of a haunting status? Okay okay there's

174
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:17,120
no such thing as a piano ghost which is to say a piano that gets killed in a terrible passion and

175
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:21,760
then levitate spirit. A piano but what about those pianos that like fall when they're trying to

176
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:28,320
hoist it up? Still no spectral energy latent spectral energy inside the piano. Now a human ghost

177
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:35,600
gets put in the piano. Now we're talking. Now we're cooking baby. Now we've got a little

178
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:42,160
ferro vehicle. Do they know that they're a piano? Second question does the piano know it's a ghost?

179
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:49,440
You know one funny thing about me hey other fellow living humans one weird thing about me

180
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:55,760
is when people tickle me I sing beautiful music. I had not words just kind of a beautiful music

181
00:19:55,760 --> 00:20:00,400
kind of a bing bing bing. I love that this could be one of those good ghost movies and he's trying

182
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:05,600
to like tell his wife and kids I love you I miss you I'm sorry about the big wreck I did that I

183
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:12,240
beefed it. It's so bad on the carpet. And they see him and then he's like wait I love you I have so

184
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:20,240
much in me but then the wife and kids just here run away. No! And so he literally has to be

185
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:26,320
self-taught how to play piano. Yes backwards because he's inside. By the way Black Mirror

186
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:30,640
season five trademark trademark trademark. Obviously we're gonna sell it. I've got it I've got

187
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:36,880
it I've got it I've got the setup. Piano falls from a crane crushes a person they rebuild the

188
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:42,880
piano. Fusion! They rebuild the piano what's that now the spear or maybe the whole person's in there

189
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:49,840
I don't know how good they are at rebuilding pianos. Maybe it's every time you hit that the

190
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:57,440
second octave f sharp key you see your person like I'm in this one. I'm sorry Steve you're

191
00:20:57,440 --> 00:21:02,240
half piano half man now you're a piano man. Yeah I can now sing us a song.

192
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:10,640
He's piano man but he does have a gun that comes out of his leg and he uses to shoot burps it's

193
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:16,800
weird it's not connected he actually had that before the accident before the accident and we

194
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:21,920
thought this made sense because you were already part robot. Hey piano man is actually pretty good

195
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:26,320
like uh ghost that's half piano half man that's actually pretty good. Yeah good joke. TM TM no

196
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:30,560
no no like good idea to sell. Oh okay. I was thinking people always tell us we don't appreciate

197
00:21:30,560 --> 00:21:35,040
Travis's jokes enough and so I wanted to put a pin in this one so that they would stop telling me

198
00:21:35,040 --> 00:21:42,560
that. Hang a lantern on it. Oh need a bit. One sec real quick drink all right I'm ready to do more

199
00:21:42,560 --> 00:21:47,440
podcast. Okay and we're back. Hello welcome back you've joined us already in progress.

200
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:55,520
Okay I'll take I'll take drinks more often then. My boss has a habit of coming out of his office

201
00:21:55,520 --> 00:22:01,280
into the bullpen loudly saying a single word then returning to his office. Mostly these words

202
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:15,600
pertain to our work. Meeting. Parking. Cash. Cattle. Cattle. Okay. Cattle. We gotta park the cows.

203
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:25,440
She bull. Whoa boss. Uh but yesterday. Scannered. Free bird. Yesterday I was having lunch and

204
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:32,000
eating a slice of homemade cake at my desk. My boss walked past my cubicle and shouted cake

205
00:22:34,160 --> 00:22:41,200
and stood there. Nice. I made awkward eye contact for about 15 seconds and said

206
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:49,760
yes and then turned around. 15 seconds is the perfect comedy amount of time to have waited

207
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:53,760
for that answer. Actually you know what I'm just going to use the the timer right here. Oh Jesus

208
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:58,000
Christ. Travis this is what that would have felt like okay. I'll be the person and you be the boss

209
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:19,040
okay. Ready. Cake. Yes. It's perfect. And that's 15 seconds of podcast that we don't have to do.

210
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:24,480
It's just done. We'll edit that down when you listen to it at home later. It'll it'll be more

211
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:30,480
like eight seconds. Um I made uh and then I turned around my chair and I ate my cake while not looking

212
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:35,440
up to make further eye contact. So you don't know how much longer the boss was there. Days.

213
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:41,120
Uh did my boss want some of my cake? Did he want a conversation about the cake?

214
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:46,480
Brothers what should I do next time he addresses one of these one-word shouts in my direction?

215
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:52,000
That's from Caked and Confused in Cowtown. Maybe your boss had only ever read about cake but never

216
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:58,480
actually seen it. There is. Cake. There's that fluffy stuff. And then when you confirmed his

217
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:04,880
identification. Yes. Nailed it. Nice. Great. No because if that was the case like nobody hears

218
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:12,160
about cake their whole life sees cake for the first time and is like all right bye anyway cool

219
00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:16,800
I'm gonna walk away with that taste of that wonderful stuff. I want I wish that the boss

220
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:24,320
would move to next cubicle and just be like cereal. Or cake. No not at this one. No cake here.

221
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:30,320
Keep looking. No. And then somebody's like eight cubicles down eating cake like oh fuck.

222
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:39,920
Is it possible that this is not just a boss but it is a boss baby? Or

223
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:49,360
a big situation? Or both big boss baby? Yeah. Which is the premise of the question we're talking

224
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:54,080
about now and also the villain of the next Metal Gear Solid game. Very excited about that.

225
00:24:55,760 --> 00:25:03,120
Just confirmed actually. Just confirmed. A big boss baby baby climbed up into the Zoltan machine

226
00:25:04,160 --> 00:25:09,680
because that's what they do. I've had a baby for 16 months now I get like nine ten claw machines

227
00:25:09,680 --> 00:25:14,400
can't take this kid to a Dave and Buster's. One time he got stuck in two different claw machines

228
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:19,600
at one Dave and Buster's trip. What am I supposed to do? Stop going to Dave and Buster's?

229
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:27,920
Watch your kid? Come on. Got blown up into Tom Hanks. Showed up to work the next day.

230
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:34,880
Apple. No. What? What? Juice. Do you want juice? You want juice? Juice.

231
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:41,360
Juice. Yes you want juice. Apple. Apple. Do you want apple juice or do you want an apple?

232
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:49,120
Cake. Cake. No. No. No. What are you even saying no to?

233
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:55,200
You're my boss. Boss? You can't cry in front of me. You're my boss.

234
00:25:55,200 --> 00:26:03,840
Boom boom. Did you did you make boom boom? You're my boss. I don't have to clean that up. Yes.

235
00:26:05,680 --> 00:26:11,760
This is the role Tom was born to play. Now in order for this to work. The role that Tom Hanks

236
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:16,240
was born to play was in the music video for I Really Really Like You. Every other role has been

237
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:21,520
ancillary. It has to be like a couple times it's really paid off and they're like this guy's got

238
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:25,360
some great idea so it's like I don't know we need to get some new computers for the office but what

239
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:31,760
kind should we get? Apple. Hey. Hey all right. Good idea. And the year is 1983 so he's like very.

240
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:39,600
Yeah it's cutting edge. Sort of out in front of it. Computers I mean. And this man's name was

241
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:46,560
Steve Jobs. And they were like what's an apple computer and he's like exactly. Welcome to the

242
00:26:46,560 --> 00:26:59,520
future start making them. How about a yahoo? Yeah let's hit the yahoo. I get nervous. Yeah I just.

243
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:02,800
Now here's where I get nervous because we're about halfway through what we're calling act

244
00:27:02,800 --> 00:27:07,680
one of tonight's festivities and usually that's where you say yeah Griffin go ahead and do your

245
00:27:07,680 --> 00:27:18,560
work up there and then I start doing my work and you're tapping on the iPad a lot. This just popped

246
00:27:18,560 --> 00:27:24,560
up. I just got a notification this just popped up. Wait what app do you get ghost notification

247
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:28,160
haunted doll notifications? If I told you then everybody would get it and the segment wouldn't

248
00:27:28,160 --> 00:27:35,680
be special anymore. Okay. It's Google Maps. It's Google Maps. It's April Fool's thing they're

249
00:27:35,680 --> 00:27:41,920
doing. Haunted porcelain doll with orbs slash paranormal slash stunning.

250
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:52,320
We never we talk about the orbs so much we never talk about how beautiful these dolls are.

251
00:27:52,320 --> 00:28:00,400
She's about to condition all caps in quotes exclamation point. Wonderful.

252
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:09,680
Okay what does that mean? What a haunted doll. The condition of this doll is wonderful.

253
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:16,880
Um first off check out the orbs.

254
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:27,840
I had a mouth full of drink when you check the peep the orbs. Check out those or those orbs though.

255
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:39,440
Like a 1980s music video. What those orbs do though. They'll fuck with your remote control.

256
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:47,680
They'll fuck with your remote control. You cannot get this hung up on each line because it is like

257
00:28:47,680 --> 00:28:52,960
there's other journeys to go on here. This doll looks just like a real little girl.

258
00:28:56,000 --> 00:29:02,560
Such a realistic face. An absolutely gorgeous doll. Her pictures do not do her justice. Hey lady

259
00:29:02,560 --> 00:29:08,240
she's got a beauty that moves. Hey lady if the pictures don't do her justice take more pictures.

260
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:16,480
It's a doll. It doesn't mind. Take more pictures until you get a picture that does it justice.

261
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:23,200
Get some glamour shots. Here's a doll from an investigation in Savannah Georgia. Cold spots

262
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:27,840
are often found in the room that she's placed in. Also thumping in the middle of the night.

263
00:29:29,680 --> 00:29:32,960
I have captured orbs in second photo so check it out.

264
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:39,120
They want to make sure you've seen the orbs. We have also seen. We are currently reading more of

265
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:44,800
the description without going to look at the orbs though which is kind of speaks to what we do on

266
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:49,840
the show with Hanna doll watch that somebody's just said I captured ghost orbs in a photo and

267
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:56,480
Justin said I'll get to those ghost orbs later. I have to keep reading. Okay well then I say I'm

268
00:29:56,480 --> 00:30:03,280
gonna have to go. I'm gonna. What are you typing? What could you control F ghost or I'm picking out

269
00:30:03,280 --> 00:30:09,600
the second image. Whoa check out those orbs. The orbs are not fucking anything. It's there's not

270
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:14,400
a lens flare. I mean you all won't you know how every JJ Abrams movie is haunted. It's just a

271
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:22,400
lens flare on the orb. It's nothing. You do photoshop effects generate orbs. Those photos do

272
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:29,280
not do her justice. The photos don't do her justice. I can say that for sure. EVPs have been

273
00:30:29,280 --> 00:30:35,520
okay sorry I got tripped up but we have also seen her slightly moved to the side at times all on

274
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:43,200
her own. She's a very beautiful doll. She has these very long golden locks of hair. EVPs have

275
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:48,400
been recorded from her in the past. We believe she's a girl from around the age of nine. We

276
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:54,320
this is the part of Haunted Doll Watch where we just. It gets sad in the middle. We have tried to

277
00:30:54,320 --> 00:31:01,600
communicate with her and asked her how she passed. We also received one EVP saying car. Okay. And

278
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:16,400
another saying ham. So we believe it she talks about her car a lot. This is what it says. She

279
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:21,520
talks about her car a lot. If you wish to adopt her into your home she can be yours. She also has

280
00:31:21,520 --> 00:31:26,320
an adorable giggle. Perhaps adorable is not what you would associate with a ghost giggle from a

281
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:34,080
doll. Be prepared exclamation point no fucking context whatsoever. Just says be prepared. Make

282
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:39,360
sure to put a towel in a cardboard box for her to live in. Because who knows. She needs a loving home

283
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:43,600
so don't adopt her unless you're going to be good to her. Oh you don't fucking care. If she only

284
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:48,320
pays the I'm going to guess thirty one dollars for this doll. You don't fucking care what kind

285
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:54,720
of home it goes to. There's no screening process. By the way hundred dollars. Oh that's about it

286
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:59,440
now. Thank you. My mistake. It is a beautiful. It is wild though. It's like be good to her. She's

287
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:03,680
like one of my children. Anyway I'm going to put her up for sale on the Internet. Is that how you're

288
00:32:03,680 --> 00:32:08,320
good to people. Do you think is putting the children for sale on the Internet. Be good to

289
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:14,000
her. Be prepared. Be prepared. Be prepared. And then this is another complete sentence. It just says

290
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:23,200
nice big doll. If you're worried about it being haunted but being too small don't worry about

291
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:31,520
that here. She's a nice big doll. Ghosts got a lot of elbow room. She is about a 24 inch doll

292
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:37,120
from the top of the hat down. Thank you for clarifying because if I had gotten the doll and

293
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:44,800
said well yeah if you count the hat I wanted a two foot tall doll. I could put my own hat on.

294
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:50,960
Great. Just imagine I think for context the eyes of the doll would be just over the top of our table.

295
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:56,400
Yeah. This is maybe. Picture it. And the orbs would be fucking crazy.

296
00:32:59,040 --> 00:33:02,560
This is maybe the most perplexing sentence in the whole thing. You're fucking kidding me. There's

297
00:33:02,560 --> 00:33:09,040
more perplexing stuff. Yeah this one's really perplexing. She's an expensive doll. Sells for

298
00:33:09,040 --> 00:33:17,840
around 300 to 400 dollars. Apparently not. I mean right. Like apparently not because you are selling

299
00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:24,560
it for 100 dollars. So like apparently not. Does having a ghost in the doll make it worth less.

300
00:33:24,560 --> 00:33:29,280
Less. Is it less valuable to capture a spectral ghost. If there was an antiques road show where

301
00:33:29,280 --> 00:33:38,720
they brought on a doll and the doll was like I don't know old and nice and belonged to you know

302
00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:46,240
Lincoln. And they were like wow I've never seen a doll in this. Is this Lincoln's. Yes. This has got

303
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:54,720
to be worth a million dollars. Well one thing. Great condition. Beautiful doll. Big old doll.

304
00:33:54,720 --> 00:34:03,760
Big nice big. Nice big doll. Be prepared. There's a ghost in there. Are we still in a mint situation.

305
00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:07,920
Are we down to like. Oh it's like when someone cleans the patina off of the thing and they're

306
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:12,160
like now if there wasn't a ghost in there. Yeah. It would be like three thousand to four thousand

307
00:34:12,160 --> 00:34:18,400
dollars. But with the ghost 20 bucks. I just feel like if you're the sort of person that would be

308
00:34:18,400 --> 00:34:23,920
concerned about the presence of a ghost in a doll is more of a binary thing right. Like it's not going

309
00:34:23,920 --> 00:34:30,480
to affect the sale price. It's going to be like no probably not. I don't actually think so because

310
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:36,960
it's haunted and the home is where I live. So I don't think so. Can I do yahoo.

311
00:34:40,640 --> 00:34:49,360
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Guess. Who did you just check with. Death. Okay. Thank you daddy. It's yahoo answers.

312
00:34:49,360 --> 00:34:53,920
No not the user but Adrian Cowell sent this one in too. Thank you Adrian. It's yahoo answers. Well

313
00:34:53,920 --> 00:34:59,360
technically I think if you go on yahoo to find yahoo's for this show. You're a part of the

314
00:34:59,360 --> 00:35:05,440
fucking community. And I'm saying that risking losing all of these good folks who are doing

315
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:14,240
this work for us but it calls them like I see them. User CPC 26 CA. This one's just fucking diarrhea.

316
00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:19,600
The other one at least had some direction. I am a cool cat. These are four sequential numbers.

317
00:35:20,640 --> 00:35:26,480
Maybe this is like a license plate. Maybe there's a code in there. It means something.

318
00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:36,000
I'm not going to do this joke. Am I. We can do that. Am I allowed to bring my Rubik's cube

319
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:59,920
to a football game. Legally. Yes. Should that change. Yes. Imagine you just did one of the

320
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:08,320
best touchdowns ever. Wait give me a second. They fumbled it. You ran it all the way back.

321
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:14,160
One yard line. You fumbled it. They ran it back. Another fumble. You ran it back. Longest touchdown

322
00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:19,840
run in history. Incredible. You're living your dream. Right. Your hands in the air.

323
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:25,920
You're living it. And then you look in the stands and there's just one person like hmm.

324
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:34,320
Hmm. Fine. Anyway back to my puzzle. And that person was my football teacher.

325
00:36:37,600 --> 00:36:39,600
My football teacher Malcolm McDowell.

326
00:36:41,680 --> 00:36:46,080
All I wanted was for him to give me a certificate that said football grand master.

327
00:36:46,080 --> 00:36:50,000
Dude's got a fucking spiral on him though like I'll show you an outlier.

328
00:36:50,000 --> 00:37:00,480
Boom 130 yards. That's Malcolm Gladwell. Oh shit. I'm sure they get that all the time.

329
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:07,840
I'll go get in the box. You you you shouldn't. If people are trying. They're performers.

330
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:12,720
They're putting on a show just for you. You realize that's the only point. Okay okay okay.

331
00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:19,040
But in one four downs of football. Uh huh. There's only like eight seconds of football

332
00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:23,760
actually being played. And then it's like a half minute of like figuring out what the next one's

333
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:28,720
going to be. Which is astounding to me because how many variations can there possibly be?

334
00:37:29,840 --> 00:37:34,480
You either throw it or you run with it or you kick it right? Am I missing something?

335
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:40,640
There's so much. But there's a lot of down times. There's also Griffin there's also the

336
00:37:40,640 --> 00:37:45,120
times where you hide it under your jersey and pretend you're pregnant. That's a fourth category

337
00:37:45,120 --> 00:37:50,720
is I think fun-em-ups like are we going to run pass kick or do a funny fun one. So you're mighty

338
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:56,480
ducks. Sounds like a mighty ducks fun one. Here go big greens. Did you guys remember there's a part

339
00:37:56,480 --> 00:38:02,000
in mighty ducks where Gordon Bombay gets mad at them for doing too many fun ducks stunts?

340
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:08,080
It's like hey Gordon we're trying to enjoy the movie. Can you not get mad at them for having

341
00:38:08,080 --> 00:38:14,000
some fun with the hockey tricks? Whenever they call a timeout. Yeah. Which in a sport if you

342
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:19,280
call a timeout that's basically you saying like we fucked up and we need to fix it right? And

343
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:24,800
that's disrespectful of my time in the stands. I want to have some busy work. I want to if not

344
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:29,440
have the whole time to play a game of Pokemon trading cards at least get my deck in order.

345
00:38:30,080 --> 00:38:35,200
At least solve one face of the Rubik's Cube. Are we running a danger though going up on the

346
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:41,040
Jumbotron of the first period? Look at this nerdlinger. And then second period let's check

347
00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:48,320
back in. Oh yikes. Having a rough time there Griffin. It's all about the snake pattern. Do

348
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:52,560
you need me to come down there and do it for you? And then you see you see one of the angels in the

349
00:38:52,560 --> 00:38:58,160
outfield behind him like no he's got it. He can do it. He's got. Okay now turn. Oh fuck no what

350
00:38:58,160 --> 00:39:05,600
was it? Uh let me do it. Shit. Uh. Let me solve it. God? Not mine. I can't figure those. Those are

351
00:39:05,600 --> 00:39:14,720
wild man. I don't know shit about those things. You know those the devil. Surprise. Um do we have

352
00:39:14,720 --> 00:39:21,360
time for one more? You wanna do another yahoo? Yes. And we're not leaving. Yeah. We're not leaving yeah

353
00:39:21,360 --> 00:39:26,320
we're just gonna pee. Um I can do it. I actually have a very good yahoo here. Okay. If I could do

354
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:33,360
two in a row that's okay with everybody here. I kid you not Adrian Kells also sent this one in.

355
00:39:33,360 --> 00:39:38,960
Absolutely fucking crushed it. It's by question mark. Probably a different one. This time I think

356
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:47,840
it was it didn't load because it's a a bad website. Uh they asked what are we gonna have

357
00:39:47,840 --> 00:39:57,760
for breakfast in 100 years from now? Thanks. Whatever it is it's gonna have good hot dog

358
00:39:57,760 --> 00:40:04,880
syrup on it. The finest. What I really like is I obviously they're asking like human beings but

359
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:08,560
what it could also be it's like hey what do you guys want to have for breakfast 100 years from

360
00:40:08,560 --> 00:40:13,680
now? I just want to start planning now. Let's go ahead and get it out in front of it. It may be

361
00:40:13,680 --> 00:40:20,960
weird to think it's human beings because it could also be talking to the answer could be us by robots.

362
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:28,320
Right. Humans. But assuming it's not about humans and we're still ruling shit 100 years from now

363
00:40:28,320 --> 00:40:36,000
no way. Um what are we gonna eat 100 years from future? Answer obvious ones. Computer eggs.

364
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:45,040
X1. Are those eggs computers like? Kind of cyber cyber bacon. Cyber bacon.

365
00:40:45,040 --> 00:40:50,080
Oh man. Amazon toast.

366
00:40:52,640 --> 00:40:58,560
I I hope that in 100 years I will be able to vape all my meals. That is why I want to get

367
00:40:58,560 --> 00:41:04,400
vape nutrients. I want vape. I don't just want vape nutrients. I want vape satisfaction. I want

368
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:11,360
a filling. I went to we went to Edith's uh Edith's cafe with the french stuff. As good as hell. As

369
00:41:11,360 --> 00:41:18,480
good as hell but I wish I had vaped it. I want that level of satisfaction. What I want and I know

370
00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:24,720
this is a long way off but what I want is a drone that will come to me and like bring me french toast

371
00:41:24,720 --> 00:41:30,640
while I sleep and open my mouth and put it in my mouth move my chin up and down massage my throat

372
00:41:30,640 --> 00:41:35,440
so I swallow it and I can just keep sleeping. And it would need to know your favorite song that it

373
00:41:35,440 --> 00:41:42,240
could play you if you wake up in the middle of this process. And a super sharp hypodermic needle

374
00:41:42,240 --> 00:41:48,240
so you wouldn't even notice the injection going in. Yeah. With the nanobots. I mean it'll be

375
00:41:48,240 --> 00:41:56,080
imagery right? Oh it just flashes flashes at you. Pictures of the food. Oh what a good picture. What

376
00:41:56,080 --> 00:42:03,200
a good picture. A delicious picture. Thank you the future. What if you could um. Oh yeah. Everybody

377
00:42:03,200 --> 00:42:09,680
stand back. Justin's got it. Stand back. He's about to dunk. Please don't. If you're sitting

378
00:42:09,680 --> 00:42:17,040
in the first three rows you may get wet. Please don't make a big deal out of it. Please. Please

379
00:42:17,040 --> 00:42:22,480
stop. Don't make a big deal out of it. Can we get the house lights up. I'm gonna take a big drink.

380
00:42:22,480 --> 00:42:32,560
No put the house lights. Yeah no let him see it. Let him see it. I'm not looking you can't make me look.

381
00:42:33,680 --> 00:42:37,200
Justin you gotta look dog. It's gonna be so good. Your great joke is gonna.

382
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:47,280
All right now we're gonna count it down. I can't wait listen before I say this one.

383
00:42:47,280 --> 00:42:51,200
Let y'all know we got merch in the lobby. Oh yeah we're gonna. Oh let's do that. Let's

384
00:42:51,200 --> 00:42:54,960
walk out after this. We're gonna come back after an intermission and do audience questions. We're

385
00:42:54,960 --> 00:42:58,480
gonna have a lot of fun in the second half of the show after we get the great walk off

386
00:42:58,480 --> 00:43:05,920
from Justin's joke which better not stink. So make sure you try to see it in the second half.

387
00:43:05,920 --> 00:43:12,720
Uh so yeah Justin that joke and let's get ready. Wouldn't it be great if.

388
00:43:12,720 --> 00:43:19,920
Wouldn't it be great if you could eat a jif of jif.

389
00:43:34,080 --> 00:43:38,240
Hey everybody it's Griffin and I'm here editing the episode while the other boys are

390
00:43:38,240 --> 00:43:42,480
out playing with a kite even though it's my birthday and I'm the one who should be out there

391
00:43:42,480 --> 00:43:45,920
with the kite and they're the ones who are actually out there doing you know kite stunts

392
00:43:45,920 --> 00:43:50,400
and that's my favorite thing but whatever. I'm gonna do the the ads real quick and let you get

393
00:43:50,400 --> 00:43:54,160
back to the rest of the episode. Thank you to Dallas and Houston for having us this past weekend.

394
00:43:54,160 --> 00:43:58,720
Sorry the episode's a bit late. We didn't get it up yesterday because we were still traveling and

395
00:43:58,720 --> 00:44:02,960
then I got it up late today because it's my freaking birthday. So huff it if you got a

396
00:44:02,960 --> 00:44:08,800
problem. I'm sorry. Anyway our first ad here is for Zip Recruiter. Are you hiring because

397
00:44:08,800 --> 00:44:14,000
posting your job to job sites and waiting it stinks and you shouldn't have to do it. It should

00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:18,480

403
00:44:39,520 --> 00:44:44,240
I also want to tell you all about Bowl and Branch. You're never gonna agree on everything with

404
00:44:44,240 --> 00:44:50,480
everyone but I think everyone can agree. I'm just counter counter contradicting what I just said but

405
00:44:50,480 --> 00:44:54,000
I think we can all agree you could all use a little bit more sleep. Getting a great night's

406
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:57,840
sleep is easier and more affordable than you think. You just got to change your sheets.

407
00:44:57,840 --> 00:45:01,680
So you should check out Bowl and Branch. We got some Bowl and Branch sheets and I'm telling you

408
00:45:01,680 --> 00:45:09,040
it's like sleeping on a dream cloud. And what's that? Well it's um you know how when you dream

409
00:45:09,040 --> 00:45:13,360
and you sweat and that sweat evaporates goes up and makes the softest clouds up in heaven for God

410
00:45:13,360 --> 00:45:18,960

new show on the maximum fun network that we'd love to share with you it's called Heat Rocks Morgan

440
00:47:53,360 --> 00:47:59,200
we should probably explain what a heat rock is it is a banger a fire track track track track

441
00:47:59,200 --> 00:48:04,480
fire track true fire right dope album each episode we will bring on a special guest to join us to

442
00:48:04,480 --> 00:48:09,040
talk about one of their heat rocks it might be a musician a writer maybe a scholar I mean I would

443
00:48:09,040 --> 00:48:13,280
have been happy to just talk to you about your heat rocks but this is a different show yeah I

444
00:48:13,280 --> 00:48:17,200
think people might enjoy hearing maybe the guests instead to do that you'll have to go to maximum

445
00:48:17,200 --> 00:48:23,200
fun.org so if you want to talk about hot music you should check us out heat rocks it's time to

446
00:48:23,200 --> 00:48:30,880
enter the gauntlet for you and for us lock the doors the gauntlet is our gauntlet it's not

447
00:48:30,880 --> 00:48:35,520
your gauntlet it's not a competition although there will be a winner and there will be a loser

448
00:48:36,800 --> 00:48:41,760
uh I'll do the pitch so here's the thing we're going to choose two people to come to the

449
00:48:41,760 --> 00:48:48,880
microphones they are going to tell us their names if they want to give us their pronouns

450
00:48:48,880 --> 00:48:55,840
if they're comfortable with that we love that if you if you see that as a uh hilarious rich vein

451
00:48:55,840 --> 00:49:03,440
of goofs don't that won't that won't go well for you trust and let me double down on that if you

452
00:49:03,440 --> 00:49:09,040
then see griffin saying don't make a joke out of it as a challenge of like oh but I think I still

453
00:49:09,040 --> 00:49:19,040
can we we are in the meat space this is not twitter we have microphones here uh so the uh and uh you'll

454
00:49:19,040 --> 00:49:26,080
give us your questions and uh we will choose the person not the person with like the zaniest or

455
00:49:26,080 --> 00:49:31,520
the funniest just the person we can help the most because honestly our toolbox you can't see it it's

456
00:49:31,520 --> 00:49:39,360
behind the table it's fairly small it's a limited also two rules other rules you know the first one

457
00:49:41,680 --> 00:49:45,920
that was no bummers if you have trouble making out a million voices at once that's right there's a

458
00:49:45,920 --> 00:49:53,120
million people here you all have set the world attendance record for and number two that mark

459
00:49:53,120 --> 00:50:00,400
marin number two number two our constant enemy and number two have it be a question and not just

460
00:50:00,400 --> 00:50:04,960
like a fun story or like a fun thing you saw okay if the ending of your question is am i good

461
00:50:06,880 --> 00:50:10,720
okay can we get house lights up and we're gonna start picking folks oh don't get up and dance

462
00:50:10,720 --> 00:50:14,960
around we just raise your hand and we will wow there's a big theater full house lights i think

463
00:50:14,960 --> 00:50:20,640
it's and maybe a little bit less stage lights okay hey what's up uh hi i'm sarah i'm super

464
00:50:20,640 --> 00:50:25,840
nervous um it's okay sarah you got this so my husband and i go to our local grocery store

465
00:50:25,840 --> 00:50:34,240
um pretty regularly buy groceries um good thing to do there for sure we can no longer go to the

466
00:50:34,240 --> 00:50:41,200
meat and seafood count counter there because the employee that is always there does not know how

467
00:50:41,200 --> 00:50:49,280
that exchange is supposed to work money for meat has been my understanding what is their

468
00:50:49,280 --> 00:50:56,480
understanding they hand you money do you have meat for me i don't know where we get the meat

469
00:50:56,480 --> 00:51:01,440
i just assume we buy it from people who come here it's a trading post i'm like an npc in a

470
00:51:01,440 --> 00:51:08,480
role playing game yes i will take your stringy buzzard meat here's 20 coin so it's worse than

471
00:51:08,480 --> 00:51:18,720
that actually um it's worse than that that was a joke go on so uh my husband and i didn't realize

472
00:51:18,720 --> 00:51:23,200
that this was happening to both of us until we both came home and complained about it um well

473
00:51:23,200 --> 00:51:28,720
ask for our meat or our seafood and he'll come out to give it to us and when we go to grab for

474
00:51:28,720 --> 00:51:46,560
it he'll pull it back and go too slow every time every time like we separately can count three or

475
00:51:46,560 --> 00:51:52,800
four times a piece okay sarah just hang tight sarah you've been through a lot okay hang on

476
00:51:54,080 --> 00:52:02,160
just hang in there one more second okay all right this is really scary wow i know imagine being us

477
00:52:03,920 --> 00:52:07,920
good point um so my name's adam i use they them pronouns what's up adam

478
00:52:10,880 --> 00:52:15,520
um so my question is kind of weird so like for for preface my dad's super affirming it's not

479
00:52:15,520 --> 00:52:20,720
the first time i've come out to him before um i'm really exceedingly queer in every way um

480
00:52:24,640 --> 00:52:28,720
and but my question is though is i have yet to come out to him as gender fluid now the thing

481
00:52:28,720 --> 00:52:34,480
is about coming out is that it's always a weird process even when it's affirming and i know the

482
00:52:34,480 --> 00:52:39,120
person is going to be affirming so my question is what's a really funny way to come out to my dad

483
00:52:39,120 --> 00:52:47,520
is gender fluid all right bye justin i'm trying to come up with questions we're less equipped to

484
00:52:47,520 --> 00:52:55,120
answer adam and frankly right now i'm drawing a blank hold on okay let me check the toolbox

485
00:52:55,120 --> 00:53:00,240
hold on let me look at the toolbox one sec oh no there's just a sandwich in here why didn't we only

486
00:53:00,240 --> 00:53:10,000
bring a sandwich oh no that's a that's a toffee adam that's so hard because you have to understand

487
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:13,360
you're asking us to come up with funny adam i don't add

488
00:53:17,840 --> 00:53:22,880
where you need to think about jiff and jiff again adam here's the thing one day you'll be able to

489
00:53:22,880 --> 00:53:28,880
eat a jiff of jiff if that's still if that's become memetic yet maybe oh that's it lead with

490
00:53:28,880 --> 00:53:33,440
that when you're talking to your dad like hey dad what if one day dad i have went also yeah we're

491
00:53:33,440 --> 00:53:38,480
gonna help adam real quick just go to your dad and say listen i have two really funny things to

492
00:53:38,480 --> 00:53:47,520
tell you you're gonna love them both equally the second one isn't a joke and the first one is

493
00:53:47,520 --> 00:53:53,280
they're not both funny okay let me start over dad i'm sorry just let me leave the room and

494
00:53:53,280 --> 00:53:57,040
walk back in you're reading like this off a sheet of paper that you've transcribed of this exact

495
00:53:57,040 --> 00:54:04,160
podcast episode and i think that's gonna go real good so thank you adam i think we're

496
00:54:06,160 --> 00:54:12,560
we're doing both yeah we're doing both thank you adam adam thank you so much does that help

497
00:54:12,560 --> 00:54:25,600
wait hold on adam does that help maybe thank you adam you are going to have to train mind body

498
00:54:25,600 --> 00:54:32,400
so that here's my 20 let me get those uh little shrimp and he goes all right here

499
00:54:36,240 --> 00:54:42,080
and then he says you're ready you're and then you have to work now you're the meat yeah my husband's

500
00:54:42,080 --> 00:54:52,240
actually tried that move to like and it did not go over damn the back ramp to beef everywhere

501
00:54:52,240 --> 00:54:57,280
okay here's what so you're saying it's literally impossible to be faster than this guy like we

502
00:54:57,280 --> 00:55:03,120
either have to like go out of our way to go to a different grocery store or become vegetarians

503
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:13,280
wow wow what uh one of my favorite things about having a baby is like to see uh humanity condensed

504
00:55:13,280 --> 00:55:18,560
into but because it's as much personality but in a very small thing and now when people do that

505
00:55:18,560 --> 00:55:25,520
like oh oh my baby's face is what every human being feels when that happens but unfiltered it's just

506
00:55:29,520 --> 00:55:38,320
and it's the best because it's like yeah that's what i feel hey you're gonna need if you if

507
00:55:38,320 --> 00:55:44,160
reflexes aren't getting it done and i still think y'all could push it a little bit harder

508
00:55:44,160 --> 00:55:52,480
you're gonna need like a a blow gun with some sort of neurotoxin or you're gonna have to partner

509
00:55:52,480 --> 00:55:57,120
with your husband right so you're standing there the person reaches out then what's that your

510
00:55:57,120 --> 00:56:05,840
husband comes and the meat and the meat salesman goes clever folks and then and then you eat him

511
00:56:05,840 --> 00:56:17,440
yeah no not like that no wait uh does that help or what if what if and you just wait oh

512
00:56:27,200 --> 00:56:29,600
ice them out

513
00:56:29,600 --> 00:56:35,600
oh or you have your own bag of meat that you brought from home and you hold it up

514
00:56:35,600 --> 00:56:39,600
and he's like and you say same time and like indiana jones it

515
00:56:41,600 --> 00:56:46,320
okay he goes back to get the meat from the meat room when he comes back you're not there

516
00:56:48,720 --> 00:56:57,440
guess that's his problem now do any of those help i like travis's idea well hey we're picking

517
00:56:57,440 --> 00:57:10,960
winners you're not i sit down sarah classic sarah okay all right uh i got should we pick

519
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:21,760

520
00:57:21,760 --> 00:57:29,360
let's see see see whoa some people are what you know what way up there next to the person

521
00:57:29,360 --> 00:57:39,280
waving their jacket oh god and y'all we gotta make examples sorry uh okay so my name's david

522
00:57:40,480 --> 00:57:49,440
yes and that is the correct response not a great start david but keep going

523
00:57:49,440 --> 00:57:59,920
about a week ago i was eating breakfast at edith's oh nice yeah and an elderly man

524
00:58:01,040 --> 00:58:06,320
the raclette oh yeah my dad had that dad had that it's a bunch of cheese how are you feeling

525
00:58:06,320 --> 00:58:13,760
he said he says bad okay uh okay so so there was an elderly man that sat next to my wife and i

526
00:58:13,760 --> 00:58:20,880
wearing a red jacket approximately the same color and size as fashionable good okay um uh real quick

527
00:58:20,880 --> 00:58:23,920
the rest of the question it's not gonna be something mean about the red jacket right no

528
00:58:23,920 --> 00:58:27,920
not at all okay good because i'm very jealous of the red jacket if i had it right now i'd wear it

529
00:58:27,920 --> 00:58:33,360
go ahead so that's why i started up a conversation with him and i found out he was a retired marine

530
00:58:33,360 --> 00:58:40,240
cool cool okay and he said that his kids couldn't come with him on a trip to hawaii and he invited

531
00:58:40,240 --> 00:58:53,920
my wife and i oh what oh did he now hold on huh the only like little thing was i would have just

532
00:58:53,920 --> 00:59:04,720

533
00:59:04,720 --> 00:59:11,680

571
01:03:54,800 --> 01:04:00,400
okay uh i have this uh slight problem with when when i'm public speaking or speaking in general

572
01:04:00,400 --> 01:04:07,120
i uh i have vocal fry my voice cracks a lot and uh i'm not sure what i should do if that ever

573
01:04:07,120 --> 01:04:15,120
happens when i'm in the middle of a funeral and i'm oh oh i see yeah so if you'd like to pay your

574
01:04:15,120 --> 01:04:34,400
last respects please come up to the okay side note i can do it on purpose okay okay but i often

575
01:04:34,400 --> 01:04:40,400
do it on accident okay and i don't want them to be like bobcat goldthwait is presenting our fear

576
01:04:40,400 --> 01:04:49,600
yeah i would love to have bobcat goldthwait at mine okay okay found thank you let's hear our

577
01:04:49,600 --> 01:04:58,160
other question hello hello i'm scott i am also a really socially anxious college student i thought

578
01:04:58,160 --> 01:05:04,400
you're gonna say also a mortuary student in training but i'm a bitter rival of the person across

579
01:05:05,040 --> 01:05:10,720
they get all the good dead bodies all right why don't we get the good dead bodies there's a new

580
01:05:10,720 --> 01:05:19,120
mortuary in town all right so scott all right so i really love like film and music criticism and

581
01:05:19,120 --> 01:05:25,280
all of that stuff and the problem is i love to bring this up and have you know discussions about

582
01:05:25,280 --> 01:05:29,840
hey i thought the editing in this was really interesting and subversive in a lot of cool ways

583
01:05:29,840 --> 01:05:36,720
and most people are like i thought that movie was fine so the question is how do i sell myself

584
01:05:36,720 --> 01:05:40,800
and not end up just making it sound like i hate their movie because i had a lot of thoughts about

585
01:05:40,800 --> 01:05:46,320
it are you talking to like spielberg no you're not talking to them about their movie no that's

586
01:05:46,320 --> 01:05:51,040
a good question other people because i need to make friends and i don't have those you want to

587
01:05:51,040 --> 01:05:56,640
have deeper conversations yeah you want to be friends with stephen spielberg and you want us

588
01:05:56,640 --> 01:06:02,560
to help you with that no i we could i want to be friends with bobcat goldthwait is the point okay

589
01:06:02,560 --> 01:06:08,240
it all ties together thank you thank you scott for tying that bit back together i mean if you're

590
01:06:08,240 --> 01:06:14,080
looking for a place to go to have more and this will be quick okay more in-depth conversations

591
01:06:14,080 --> 01:06:20,560
about movies and music my experience has been literally go to any non-starbucks coffee shop

592
01:06:20,560 --> 01:06:27,040
and wait about four seconds i yeah i will i will also say right across the street i'm pretty sure

593
01:06:27,040 --> 01:06:30,960
he's at college and they probably have some kind of like actually it's not even across the street

594
01:06:30,960 --> 01:06:41,440
i think we're technically in it um uh so that but also real quick answer establish yourself

595
01:06:41,440 --> 01:06:46,320
in the group as like the person who knows why a thing is because like i i have friends that

596
01:06:46,320 --> 01:06:50,800
like know about music and i'll hear a song and i'll look at them and say why do i like that oh

597
01:06:50,800 --> 01:06:55,200
it's because the way that this like diminishes and resolves itself is very satisfying and so

598
01:06:55,200 --> 01:06:59,280
people that i'm like okay great thank you very much and so being a resource for information

599
01:06:59,280 --> 01:07:04,400
like that can like really be useful in a conversation much better to be a resource

600
01:07:04,400 --> 01:07:08,640
than kind of like force that information onto someone else you gotta wait for your opportunity

601
01:07:08,640 --> 01:07:13,120
yes that's a very good point the problem there is you you don't just go up to people like i'm

602
01:07:13,120 --> 01:07:19,280
your resource now open me up i'm an encyclopedia hey you can try it yeah yeah you can try it

603
01:07:20,320 --> 01:07:25,440
what you need to know this let's thank you very much i hope we helped even a little bit god thank

604
01:07:25,440 --> 01:07:33,200
you all right i'm gonna get i'm gonna get real for a second i think well first of all this is

605
01:07:33,200 --> 01:07:39,280
the first time i've and maybe the closest proximity to me dunking on a profession as a goof in an

606
01:07:39,280 --> 01:07:44,640
episode of the podcast and then being confronted by a practitioner of that profession i'm sorry

607
01:07:44,640 --> 01:07:49,680
i made jokes about funeral directors i heard a lot about it the next day it was all fun and

608
01:07:49,680 --> 01:07:53,600
games apparently must not have been a very good goof because nobody here seems to remember that

609
01:07:53,600 --> 01:08:02,400
i did it so that being said i think something like busting out a nar vocal fry in the middle

610
01:08:02,400 --> 01:08:07,760
of like a funeral speech is actually a pretty great thing because the folks who are there are

611
01:08:07,760 --> 01:08:16,080
very sad and usually usually very sad and whenever something happens that is like a funny memory of

612
01:08:16,080 --> 01:08:20,480
that day during a sad no i'm serious whenever something funny happens during like a very sad

613
01:08:20,480 --> 01:08:25,520
thing that like breaks the tension of it like best case scenario that's the stuff you remember

614
01:08:25,520 --> 01:08:31,120
from a funeral and so 100 serious like that's a good thing that you're providing a moment of like

615
01:08:31,120 --> 01:08:35,680
levity even though you're the butt of the joke maybe a little bit if it's like a funny memory

616
01:08:35,680 --> 01:08:38,720
that they get to take home then that's a good this is absolutely true because it's the kind of

617
01:08:38,720 --> 01:08:42,880
thing where in the moment it might feel inappropriate but 10 years later is the thing

618
01:08:42,880 --> 01:08:49,680
like hey do you remember yeah i do and like you have a strange kind of fond memory you'll be a

619
01:08:49,680 --> 01:08:53,600
you'll be the most powerful inside joke between these two people who are experiencing the most

620
01:08:53,600 --> 01:09:00,800
bittersweet moment of their life ever and that sucks for you but it's so good for them i uh to

621
01:09:00,800 --> 01:09:09,040
break our to break our own rule for a moment uh when we were at our um our mom's uh viewing uh

622
01:09:09,040 --> 01:09:14,480
one of our extended relatives came up to us and said i'm so sorry and i without really

623
01:09:14,480 --> 01:09:28,080
thinking about it said we don't blame you and i'm pretty sure i was just being a dick

624
01:09:28,080 --> 01:09:36,720
because i thought i'd earned it there was like that's what i remember the most from that day

625
01:09:36,720 --> 01:09:41,520
and that's good because there's a lot of bummer shit there was somebody who

626
01:09:41,520 --> 01:09:45,600
walked up to me and said your mom's in heaven and she can't wait for you to get there

627
01:09:45,600 --> 01:09:59,760
i think i think i think providing something memorable like that is gonna make is gonna

628
01:09:59,760 --> 01:10:05,280
make the day easier for people and honestly that should be a focus of your profession from now on

629
01:10:05,280 --> 01:10:07,920
slapstick i'm being a hundred here's your coffee

630
01:10:07,920 --> 01:10:14,720
i was self-imposed i was like oh i'm pieing the face to the brief but like you like

631
01:10:14,720 --> 01:10:22,240
trip and fall and it's just like don't mind me everybody there's probably going to be one out

632
01:10:22,240 --> 01:10:27,440
of a hundred people who are like so disrespectful and the other one would be like they ripped a big

633
01:10:27,440 --> 01:10:43,920
beaver in the middle of it guys guys patch sadoms all right does that help

661
01:13:24,640 --> 01:13:27,640
something that we return to the next week after thinking about it.

662
01:13:27,640 --> 01:13:32,840
Griffin, what is the final question of this episode of My Brother, My Brother, and Me?

663
01:13:32,840 --> 01:13:39,240
Whatever is one pasta hat trick, because this is Adrian Cowell's again with the clothes, they're crushed it.

Are you tired of trying to keep up with the news cycle?

676
01:14:26,240 --> 01:14:28,240
Is bad stuff happening too fast for you to process?

677
01:14:28,240 --> 01:14:33,240
Don't you wish there was an easy way to find out about only the most important info you need?

We ask each other stupid questions.

689
01:14:54,240 --> 01:14:59,240
If you got a packet with like 300 seeds in it,

690
01:14:59,240 --> 01:15:06,240
what kind of plant would you choose the seeds to be?

691
01:15:06,240 --> 01:15:10,240
That felt like you were assigned to ask me a question

692
01:15:10,240 --> 01:15:12,240
and there were certain words you weren't allowed to use.

693
01:15:12,240 --> 01:15:16,240
