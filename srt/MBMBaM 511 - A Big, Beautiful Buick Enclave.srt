1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:30,720
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:46,880
Hey, you know how we've been talking about not doing an intro?

6
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:48,480
Yeah. Yeah.

7
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:54,080
Stop. No, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on. Come on. I'm actually,

8
00:00:54,080 --> 00:00:58,320
I am, I've been editing this show for 10 fucking years without complaint.

9
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:00,400
Uh-huh. I'm not going to,

10
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:07,200
I simply won't allow this to happen. I'm playing the card that I feel like I am owed

11
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:12,080
for that extra work and saying that this won't be a show.

12
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:14,880
Yeah, I know, I know, but riddle me piss, boys.

13
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,480
Justin, can you make, Justin, will you talk to him?

14
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:20,480
My name is Justin McElroy. My brother, my brother,

15
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:23,520
meets an advisor for The Mudge Manor. I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy.

16
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:26,160
I'm the riddle master. That's Travis.

17
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:29,120
I'm the sweet baby brother, Griffin McElroy. And Travis, can I say something?

18
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:32,960
You're obviously trying to be quiet so as not to wake up a young person.

19
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:37,920
And so like, yeah, there's something even fucking worse about him.

20
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:41,440
It's worse. It's worse. It's worse. It's worse.

21
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:43,520
It's like he's in my ear. I hate it.

22
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:45,520
Me piss needs riddled.

23
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:46,640
No, that's nothing.

24
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:54,080
We've never really gotten into what that title means,

25
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:59,200
but does the riddle master urinate in some sort of bowl

26
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:02,480
that then we're supposed to splash around? What's up with that, Trav?

27
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:05,600
When you get the answer correct, I piss a little.

28
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:11,120
Okay, sweet, man. Fuck yeah. Let's do it. Now I'm on board.

29
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:14,080
This one was sent in by Jonathan. Thank you, Jonathan.

30
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:21,120
If a chicken says all chickens are liars, is the chicken telling the truth?

31
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:23,360
No. Next question.

32
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:28,880
Well, I'm going to say yes. So certainly we've broken your spell, right?

33
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:31,680
Because he said no and I said yes. So the spell is broken.

34
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:33,920
One of the correct answers is out there.

35
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:36,000
Answer, chickens cannot talk.

36
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:38,560
That's actually a pretty good riddle.

37
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:39,360
That's actually a good riddle.

38
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:44,960
Is it? Is it? Because that seems like if you walk up to two statues

39
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:47,280
and one statue says, one of us always tells the lie,

40
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:48,640
one of us always tells the truth.

41
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:50,160
And I'm like, oh, I think the one on the right.

42
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:52,720
And you're like, no, fuck you. Statues don't talk, idiot.

43
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:55,040
Yeah, bud. That's a good solution to the riddle

44
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:58,000
because it's a little brain twisty. And Trav, can I say something?

45
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,640
This bit is fucking dead and you just killed it

46
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:01,840
because that was a good riddle.

47
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:03,040
And now you're the asshole.

48
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:04,400
Because chickens cannot talk is a good-

49
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:06,080
Maybe Jonathan's the asshole.

50
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:12,560
I want to call bullshit because if you say if in the riddle,

51
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:19,360
you are creating a reality in which this supposition is true.

52
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:21,360
If, then, right?

53
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:29,120
So it would be like me saying, if my Buick got into a car crash,

54
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:32,800
would it still be drivable? And then you thought about it

55
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:36,960
and then I would say, the correct answer is I don't have a Buick.

56
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:41,520
And it's like, okay, but we've already established the framework

57
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:43,200
in which the if is true.

58
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:43,840
Thank you.

59
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:46,880
So the if assumes that the chicken is talking.

60
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:50,800
What I should say is if a chicken says all chickens are liars,

61
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:52,720
is the chicken telling the truth? Answer.

62
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:55,520
Chickens cannot talk and you should probably seek help.

63
00:03:57,440 --> 00:03:59,840
Then what you've established is I know that you think

64
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:01,840
that that chicken said all chickens are liars,

65
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:04,960
but my friend, chickens cannot talk and I'm worried about you.

66
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:09,760
Can I just dip in here real quick to assuage the audience's fears

67
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:11,840
and concerns and say that-

68
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:14,240
Well, you're going to assuage the audience's fears and concerns.

69
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:18,320
I'm going to go take a nap. I'll be back in 45 minutes

70
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:20,480
once you address all these concerns.

71
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:22,240
Justin does have a Buick.

72
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:25,280
He's always talking about his big, beautiful Buick enclave.

73
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:30,080
And I know people when they said, when Justin said that,

74
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:31,200
you were like, wait a minute,

75
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:34,400
has he been lying about his incredible Buick enclave this whole time?

76
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:38,000
And I just want you to know that was, Justin, say psych.

77
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:38,400
Psych.

78
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:39,600
Thank you.

79
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:41,920
All of that fan art would have gone to waste.

80
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:44,480
Of you riding around in your big fucking Buick,

81
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:46,000
hanging out the beautiful Buick.

82
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:46,560
Oh, I'm sorry.

83
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:48,960
I meant the fan art where people drew Justin

84
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:51,520
as a big, beautiful Buick enclave.

85
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:51,840
Oh, that's cool.

86
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:55,280
Any fan art in which I am not depicted behind the wheel

87
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:59,760
of my big, beautiful Buick enclave is actually non-canonical.

88
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:00,160
Yeah.

89
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:04,720
It is only canonical if I'm like in the Buick enclave

90
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:07,040
with tunes blasting.

91
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:08,080
Yeah, shit tunes.

92
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:14,800
I got the pedal to the sort of halfway to the metal at a safe speed.

93
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:16,400
Yeah, I saw a piece.

94
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:19,040
You have a cold brew waiting for you at home

95
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:21,600
where you will not be driving.

96
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:25,120
And that's hard to depict of an object that is that far away.

97
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:29,040
But Juice, one time on Tumblr, I saw you driving a Chevy Cruze

98
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:30,160
and I reported it.

99
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:34,480
I reported it and the user was promptly arrested.

100
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:37,680
Yeah, I love driving my big, beautiful Buick.

101
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:38,640
Yeah, we know.

102
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:44,800
One thing I do is that I leave the passenger side airbag inflated

103
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:47,520
so I can sleep in there because I know you want to leave it.

104
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:49,360
Yeah, it's nice.

105
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:51,520
Your family does miss you, by the way.

106
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:53,680
My family should be a Buick if they want my affection.

107
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:56,720
But Sydney called me and told me to ask you

108
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:58,560
to please come inside from the garage.

109
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:01,840
You've just been recording in the Buick and eating in the Buick.

110
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:03,360
Well, does Sydney have a Hemi?

111
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:05,680
You know, I haven't asked.

112
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:07,600
Does she go honk-honk when she talk?

113
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:08,320
No.

114
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:08,800
No.

115
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:11,440
She get 18 city, 26 highway?

116
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:12,080
No.

117
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:15,280
Is she a mid-sized luxury SUV?

118
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:16,480
No.

119
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:20,400
She's not my beautiful, beautiful Buick conclave.

120
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:22,400
Travis, what would you say, just to guesstimate,

121
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:24,400
Sydney's towing capacity is?

122
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:26,000
Is it 1,500 pounds?

123
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:26,720
Is it 1,500 pounds?

124
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:28,160
Oh no, not even close, there's no way.

125
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:28,400
Probably not.

126
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:29,360
Maybe 1,200?

127
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:29,600
Jeez.

128
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:33,680
Just another way in which Sydney doesn't really measure up

129
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:35,840
to the 2020 Buick enclave.

130
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:39,040
I love my children, but what they don't have

131
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:40,960
is a refined powertrain.

132
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:41,440
That's true.

133
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:43,920
That is gonna give you a gentle ride.

134
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:46,800
They have very little space for cargo also.

135
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:49,120
But Justin, can your Buick give you a hug?

136
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:51,760
You're missing the point, Travis.

137
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:53,040
You don't understand, Travis.

138
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:55,360
The Buick has the smart slide second row

139
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:57,440
that makes room for all the big groceries

140
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:59,120
Justin buys every week.

141
00:06:59,120 --> 00:06:59,600
Yeah.

142
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:05,920
Dude, did my kids get called by U.S. News and World Report a car?

143
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:06,960
They didn't, right?

144
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:10,640
So no, they're not a car.

145
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:13,440
They're not my big, beautiful Buick enclave.

146
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:14,480
I guess that's true.

147
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:23,120
The saddest irony is I bought this big, beautiful Buick enclave

148
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:25,040
to tow my family around.

149
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:25,520
Right.

150
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:30,480
But the Buick enclave became a found family for me.

151
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:36,320
I have connected myself to it in every available pore hole

152
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:42,000
and sort of orifice, a car orifice that it possesses.

153
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:48,080
I am turning myself into a Matrix-like human hybrid.

154
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:50,160
Now, it is not a Toyota Matrix, Justin.

155
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:52,560
It is a beautiful Buick enclave.

156
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:53,040
Right.

157
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:54,000
That's a good point.

158
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,480
Right, that's a good point. Thank you.

159
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:58,400
So this is like in Lawn Mower Man,

160
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:01,200
except instead of connecting yourself to a lawnmower,

161
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:02,480
you're connecting yourself to a car.

162
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:06,480
It's not a lawnmower.

163
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:11,040
It's a beautiful 2020 Buick enclave.

164
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:14,880
Now, what if your children asked to get in the Buick with you?

165
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:18,560
Oh, there's a whole delousing process.

166
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:21,040
It's like the Andromeda strain.

167
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:25,600
They have to walk through a sort of antiseptic goo,

168
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:27,360
wade through that.

169
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,080
I will say about this, about the Buick enclave,

170
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:36,480
the interior stains like hysterically easily.

171
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:42,320
Like I sneezed in there and there's been a sort of beige spot

172
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:45,600
on the passenger seat that I just cannot get rid of.

173
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:50,000
If my kids want to sit in my big beautiful Buick enclave,

174
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,520
they're going to have lots of options.

175
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:55,120
There's three rows of first class seating in this back there.

176
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:57,840
Yeah, with a chest, got that chestnut interior.

177
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:00,000
Oh, I love that.

178
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,520
Yeah, it's really nice.

179
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:04,480
It's a beautiful, I mean, they have so many options,

180
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:08,320
except the option to come into the car and sit in it.

181
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:12,640
They can't sit in daddy's new wife, is I guess what I'm saying.

182
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:18,560
But wife is so reductive because it's also like my father.

183
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:20,480
And it's also like yourself.

184
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:23,040
This car is everything to me.

185
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:24,720
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

186
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:28,000
Do you know what you can't get with a Buick enclave?

187
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:28,640
What?

188
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:31,280
Within six feet of me, that's what I'm saying.

189
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:33,760
I don't get out of the enclave.

190
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:34,880
Okay.

191
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:35,600
Oh, I see.

192
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:38,080
It's a large vehicle, I think.

193
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:40,240
Once the dining room is reopened at McDonald's,

194
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:42,960
I'm just going to drive my enclave straight into it.

195
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:46,160
This is probably a bad time to mention this,

196
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:47,120
but this week's episode-

197
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:49,200
There's no bad time in my Buick enclave.

198
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:50,240
Time has no meaning.

199
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:55,680
Let me open the sunroof so I can use the included sundial

200
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:57,040
to tell what time it is.

201
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:59,200
And then I'll tell you if it's a bad time for this.

202
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:01,120
This week's episode is sponsored by Ford.

203
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,240
Wow, that is uncomfortable.

204
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:04,480
Yeah.

205
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:07,360
I guess we better start.

206
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:13,360
Well, anyway, I've got this new 2016 Ford Explorer.

207
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:16,000
That's really, it makes me want to barf saying good things about it.

208
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,680
I can't do it.

209
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:18,880
I can't do it.

210
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:21,760
I really want to throw up.

211
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:23,920
2019 Ford Fiesta.

212
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:25,520
Do not throw up in the Buick.

213
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:27,520
No, I would never.

214
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:29,040
It's got this.

215
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:32,400
I can't, guys, I can't stop talking about my beautiful car.

216
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:36,480
It's got a 3.6L V6 SIDI with VVT.

217
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:37,600
Whoa, whoa.

218
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:40,960
I don't want to tell tales out of school,

219
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:43,040
and maybe I'll have to cut this out,

220
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:47,120
but I feel like if your big, beautiful Buick Enclave drove-

221
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:48,160
Oh, boy.

222
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:51,920
Even you saying it, it makes me happy and sad.

223
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:53,360
Because get it out your mouth.

224
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:58,880
Yeah, if it drove right at a 2019 Ford Fiesta,

225
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:00,640
in a parking lot even, you're backing up.

226
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:01,680
You're not looking where you're going.

227
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:04,320
You're going to crunch one of these like a Bigfoot monster car.

228
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:08,000
So this thing's a tin can.

229
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,320
It won't protect your family like the Buick Enclave.

230
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:13,520
The Buick Enclave will die for you and your family.

231
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:14,800
The Buick Enclave.

232
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:18,400
I'm talking about 0% APR for 84 months, guys.

233
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:19,760
These things are wild.

234
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:21,200
That's a steal, Justin.

235
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:22,960
You're basically taking the Buick

236
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:25,040
from the dealership at that point.

237
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:26,800
And Justin, tell me about the curves

238
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:29,040
and how they satisfy you.

239
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:32,960
Oh, boy, you can get a personalized look.

240
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:35,280
They got enhanced functionality and utility.

241
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:39,600
There's assist steps if you want to go that route.

242
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:41,040
No way.

243
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:43,120
They got universal tablet holders

244
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:44,640
to rear seat entertainment,

245
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:48,080
all kinds of great options to keep the kids occupied.

246
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:49,760
Not that my kids are allowed in it.

247
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:50,260
Right.

248
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:53,520
Listen, I don't want to burn myself out

249
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:54,560
talking about the Buick.

250
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:56,480
Because listen, we have a lot of weeks of us

251
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:57,680
talking about the Buick ahead of us.

252
00:11:57,680 --> 00:12:01,520
They got, listen, you buy accessories

253
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:02,800
for this thing online,

254
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:05,120
you're going to get free ground shipping.

255
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:05,680
You know why?

256
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:07,920
Because everybody at Buick loves

257
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:09,520
driving around in the Buick so much,

258
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:11,600
they take it as a delight,

259
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:13,280
as a treat to drive to West Virginia

260
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:14,240
to hand deliver it.

261
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:16,480
Because that's more time they get in the Buick.

262
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:19,040
I will say, I know I just sponsored

263
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:20,000
the idea of moving on,

264
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,760
but I will say I love it when you buy a Buick

265
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:22,800
at the Buick dealership.

266
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:25,120
And every time you do, everybody celebrates

267
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:26,320
because they know how happy

268
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:27,680
the Buick is going to make you.

269
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:29,440
Because it makes them so fucking happy too.

270
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:33,200
I had a Briss the first time,

271
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:35,360
a traditional Briss,

272
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:37,360
the first time that I bought a Buick.

273
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:39,280
And then when I came back three weeks later

274
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:41,280
for another Buick, they said,

275
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:42,560
it's time for another Briss.

276
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:47,200
And I said, I don't know how we're going to do it twice.

277
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:50,160
That's, I want the Buick for sure.

278
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:52,240
They said, okay, so you do want the Buick.

279
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:54,080
You can't have a Buick without the Briss.

280
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:55,840
That's what I have been told.

281
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:58,320
You just kind of dropped the piece of information, Justin.

282
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:01,920
Do you own two big, beautiful Buick enclaves?

283
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:06,880
Two in the East Wing, yes.

284
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:09,760
There are two East Wing Buicks

285
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:12,080
because one was lonely, okay?

286
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:13,040
Yeah, of course.

287
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:15,520
And I am buying them a son.

288
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:18,480
So there's a third one.

289
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:19,760
A Buick son, yeah.

290
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:22,320
Yes, it is their adopted son.

291
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:26,640
They sadly cannot reproduce independently.

292
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:30,240
I have to buy a new Buick to suit their needs.

293
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:33,200
So I guess just like, I'm fucking disappointed in you

294
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:34,960
for saying you didn't own a Buick.

295
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:37,440
How could you even joke about shit like that?

296
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:40,800
Yeah, there's nothing funny about Buicks as we've proven.

297
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:45,200
I just love this big, big car.

298
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:49,680
So this is an advice show and we help people

299
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:51,040
and here's our first question.

300
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:53,920
Brothers, I am 25 years old.

301
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:57,120
I have a college degree and I have never eaten a pickle.

302
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:59,200
I haven't been actively avoiding pickles.

303
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:00,800
I've just never gotten the urge to chow down

304
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:02,560
on one of those tiny, crunchy guys.

305
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:05,440
At this point, I want my first pickle experience

306
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:06,640
to be something special.

307
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:09,520
How should I spend it to make my first

308
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:12,240
real pickle eating experience something to remember?

309
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:15,520
Keep in mind, I'm allergic to peanuts,

310
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:20,400
tree nuts, gluten, milk, and bees.

311
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:23,200
I mean, the good news, Jimbles,

312
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:26,400
the good news is that none of those things

313
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:29,280
are traditional pickle components.

314
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:30,720
Oh wait, they say bees.

315
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:33,520
Nevermind, shit.

316
00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:35,920
Now I'm glad they got out ahead of those allergies

317
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:37,680
because my first suggestion was obviously

318
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:39,440
gonna be a milk dipped pickle.

319
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:42,000
Yeah, because that is covered in nuts.

320
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,480
Cover it, cover it in nuts.

321
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:48,080
Now here's, this is a good, okay.

322
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:48,960
25, right?

323
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:52,400
25 years of built up pickle energy.

324
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:53,680
Yeah.

325
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:58,640
You don't wanna just pop open the jar,

326
00:14:58,640 --> 00:15:01,280
sit down at your coffee table by yourself,

327
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:02,640
crunch into a Vlasic,

328
00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:05,600
and then just, I don't know, doing nothing, right?

329
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:06,240
It could kill you.

330
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:07,200
It could kill you.

331
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:09,120
It could actually kill you if you do that.

332
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:11,440
But I'm saying, is that really what you've been waiting

333
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:14,560
25 years to do, or is it like,

334
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:18,800
this moment is 25 years in the making.

335
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:23,120
How are we going to make sure that you set it apart?

336
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:25,760
Because listen, after this, when you have your second pickle,

337
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:26,960
that can be nothing, right?

338
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:28,240
Your second pickle can be like,

339
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:30,080
oh, it was on the burger and I didn't even notice.

340
00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:33,280
But your first pickle, that's special.

341
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:36,480
I wanna raise a red flag on this one

342
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:38,480
just to sort of get it out there.

343
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:42,400
You're allergic to peanuts, tree nuts,

344
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:44,480
gluten, milk, and bees.

345
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:47,520
Are you real, real sure you're allergic to pickles?

346
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:50,240
How confident are you that you're not allergic

347
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:51,680
to also pickles?

348
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:54,000
See, I was gonna say that you might not like them,

349
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,760
but your point is way better.

350
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:58,080
Yeah, you won't like them.

351
00:15:58,080 --> 00:15:59,440
They're foul, but-

352
00:15:59,440 --> 00:15:59,940
Whoa.

353
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:01,760
Sorry.

354
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:04,640
Last episode, we talked a lot of mad shit about vegetables,

355
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:06,320
and I was willing to let that slide.

356
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:07,440
But pickles are great.

357
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:10,800
Now not, oh, not whatever those sweet pieces of shit are,

358
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:14,160
but a nice dill, a nice crunchy dill.

359
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:17,280
Oh, that's heaven, my friends.

360
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:19,440
I think one thing you could do-

361
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:20,480
Griffin, settle it.

362
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:22,560
Make a ruling that we all have to abide by.

363
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:24,160
About whether or not pickles are good?

364
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:24,560
Yeah.

365
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:25,920
I like a little pickle,

366
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:28,720
but when I get served a whole fucking pickle spear

367
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:31,120
with my sandwich, I'm like, this is wasteful.

368
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:32,880
I just want a bite of pickle.

369
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:35,120
Okay, okay, stop the show.

370
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:35,840
Stop the show.

371
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:37,120
I need to talk about this.

372
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:38,080
All right.

373
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:40,320
Isn't it weird, as you get to be an adult,

374
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:44,160
you learn about this secret class of food,

375
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:48,320
and it is between foods that you like to eat

376
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:51,840
and foods that you don't like to eat, right?

377
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:54,240
There's this weird subclass where it's like,

378
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:57,040
I can eat a bit of this food,

379
00:16:57,040 --> 00:17:00,560
but too much of this food, and I don't like it anymore.

380
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:02,880
That's wild, but I get it, right?

381
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:04,560
Like, I feel that way.

382
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:06,560
You know what I feel that way about mayonnaise?

383
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:11,600
If there's a thin kiss of mayonnaise-

384
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:12,080
Right.

385
00:17:12,080 --> 00:17:13,280
I do enjoy a little bit of-

386
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:14,400
I go crazy for it, yeah.

387
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:16,320
The wetness, yeah, the crazy for it.

388
00:17:16,320 --> 00:17:18,320
But if somebody just slops it on there,

389
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:22,000
it starts to make you wonder, maybe I don't like mayonnaise

390
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:25,600
because it's very present and very assertive in this sandwich.

391
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:29,520
That is one of the hardest things about getting my toddler to eat

392
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:31,120
is she's like, I don't think I like this.

393
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:33,920
And I'm like, oh, what I want to say is like, that's fair.

394
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:36,720
Like, okay, yeah, sure.

395
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:39,440
You're a human being with thoughts and feelings all your own,

396
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:44,400
and it's okay if you don't say enjoy, I don't know, celery.

397
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:45,200
That's fine.

398
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:46,480
It is weird.

399
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:49,120
I always feel compelled to give my kid a pass

400
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:52,960
on like, Charlie wouldn't eat cooked carrots a few nights ago.

401
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:54,800
And she was like, do I have to eat these?

402
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:56,560
I was like, absolutely not, they're foul.

403
00:17:56,560 --> 00:17:57,120
They're gross.

404
00:17:57,120 --> 00:17:58,400
They're so gross.

405
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:00,720
I like a cooked carrot.

406
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:02,320
I don't care, Travis.

407
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:04,720
You're not her father, as I have to tell you weekly.

408
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:06,720
I don't care how you feel about cooked carrots.

409
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:07,220
I'm just saying.

410
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:10,080
I want to pitch this, and this is actually,

411
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:12,400
this is a pretty good blanket solution to a lot of,

412
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:16,640
I don't like food, I don't like X food or drink questions

413
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:18,560
that we get, and it's, you get it.

414
00:18:18,560 --> 00:18:20,320
Not that this is one of those, but go on.

415
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:21,360
That's kind of one of those.

416
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:23,680
It's that they don't, they're pretty sure they don't like them

417
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:25,040
or else they would have eaten them at this point.

418
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:26,240
They're afraid of pickles.

419
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:29,200
So like, let's start there and move on.

420
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:33,920
You get a big jar of pickles and just that,

421
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:40,400
and you go out bouldering in the lovely picturesque canyons

422
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:45,200
of Utah State, and then you have an accident

423
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:47,920
and fall in a ravine and get your arm trapped

424
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:50,800
by a very heavy rock that you can't move

425
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:52,800
or free yourself from the situation.

426
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:55,360
And you're going to spend some time there.

427
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:59,440
I'm going to say slightly more than 120 hours.

428
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:02,000
And what's that in your pack?

429
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:04,400
It is the big jar of pickles.

430
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:06,240
And after a while, like you are good.

431
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:09,840
You and that jar of pickles are going to be fucking road dogs.

432
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:13,200
Do you think if Aaron Ralston had a big jar of pickles

433
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:15,280
and didn't like pickles and was trapped

434
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:17,760
in that fateful canyon, he would be like,

435
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:19,280
oh, but I don't like these pickles.

436
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:20,720
And he would smash them to the ground?

437
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:21,600
Probably not.

438
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:24,080
He would probably get their nutrients and like them.

439
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:28,640
What you're saying is you cannot say you don't like a food

440
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:31,040
if you would eat it rather than starve to death?

441
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:35,360
No, I'm not putting labels on it.

442
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:36,720
I'm saying this is a good way.

443
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:38,960
And then you get saved by the park ranger

444
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:43,360
or you do remove your arm with like a credit card

445
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:44,160
or whatever the fuck.

446
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:47,680
And then you will be so grateful to pickles.

447
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:49,760
Pickles will now be your favorite food.

448
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:51,360
Five years from now, we get an email like,

449
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:52,800
hey, I can't stop eating pickles.

450
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:56,160
They saved my life in the picturesque canyons of Utah State.

451
00:19:57,440 --> 00:19:59,520
And by the way, did you guys know

452
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:02,560
if you Google 120 something hours to figure out

453
00:20:02,560 --> 00:20:06,960
the name of the movie, you will find out it's 127 hours

454
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:09,120
and you will see the top Google question,

455
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:12,400
which is, is Aaron Ralston's arm still there?

456
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:14,000
Which is so cool.

457
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:14,640
I love that.

458
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:16,320
I love the idea of park rangers.

459
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:18,960
Like one of them, like they're just like two of them

460
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:21,200
standing under a ravine looking up at this arm.

461
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:22,400
Just like, ah, fuck, I don't know.

462
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:23,040
Take your hat off.

463
00:20:23,040 --> 00:20:24,560
Can I throw your hat up at it?

464
00:20:24,560 --> 00:20:25,680
Nope, that didn't work.

465
00:20:25,680 --> 00:20:26,180
Shit.

466
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:33,600
Do you think at hour 126 he started to get sentimental?

467
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:35,840
Like I'm gonna miss this.

468
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:38,480
This hasn't been fun through a lot of it,

469
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:43,200
but I can't believe I've only got one hour left of this.

470
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:49,360
Because he knew, he knew, he got trapped in there

471
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:52,800
and within seconds he was like in 127 hours.

472
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:56,160
The timer starts now.

473
00:20:57,040 --> 00:20:58,560
I'm cutting my way out of here.

474
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:01,840
And you know, if he had made it to 128,

475
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:03,280
he would have won that boulder.

476
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:08,320
I want to dig into, I haven't been actually avoiding pickles.

477
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:10,320
I've just never gotten the urge to chow down

478
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:11,760
on one of these tiny crunchy guys.

479
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:17,680
I feel like pickles more than, I mean, literally any food.

480
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:20,240
Pickles are the food that are like,

481
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:23,120
I open something getting ready to enjoy it

482
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:25,440
and a pickle's like, I'm here too.

483
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:26,400
Oh yeah, everyone.

484
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:30,400
I've already, I already got your sandwich,

485
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:32,080
a little puree, more sound.

486
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:35,360
And come on in, the water is fine.

487
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:38,320
Like the pickle is, I cannot tell you,

488
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:40,960
there are so few foods that,

489
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:42,720
I can't think of actually any others

490
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:45,280
where like you get a food and it's coming to you

491
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:47,760
and then you open it and then a pickle is like,

492
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:50,000
I have also joined.

493
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,640
I have come along for the adventure of my lifetime.

494
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:56,240
It is like every restaurant when they were opening,

495
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:59,440
like every accidentally ordered some pickles.

496
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:02,640
That's what I always think when someone brings you your sandwich

497
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:04,720
and chips and a pickle, it's like,

498
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:08,480
okay, but this wasn't listed in the menu.

499
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:11,120
It wasn't like, it comes with a random pick.

500
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:13,360
I see the plate has chips.

501
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:15,440
You would not want to forget me.

502
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:18,000
I'd love to ensogen some of those beauties.

503
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:23,280
There's just no way that you haven't had a pickle

504
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:25,920
confronting you where you're just like,

505
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:29,200
I don't know what to do with this weird salty garnish.

506
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:31,360
You don't know what a pickle is

507
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:33,920
and you've eaten a pickle on a sandwich

508
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:35,440
but you didn't know, you were just like,

509
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:36,960
that's just wet cucumber.

510
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:39,440
I'll have that salty cucumber, yes, please.

511
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:42,160
Maybe they watched that funny Rick and Morty episode

512
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:45,040
and they think that the pickle has to be able to walk

513
00:22:45,040 --> 00:22:46,720
and talk and have a face and be funny.

514
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:48,800
Isn't that weird that he's not called Rickle?

515
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:51,520
That's funny too, Trav, fuck.

516
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:52,320
Yeah, I know, right?

517
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:56,400
What a generous concept, Pickle Rick.

518
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:57,840
Can I do a yahoo?

519
00:22:57,840 --> 00:23:00,240
Yeah, I just do want to say there's no fucking chance

520
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:02,960
that Pickle Rick is not in the new Tony Hawk remake.

521
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:07,600
Just 100% right now, definitely happening.

522
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:09,520
You think playable character or?

523
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:10,560
Oh, for sure, for sure.

524
00:23:10,560 --> 00:23:12,960
Or like an NPC, you get a Questrum or?

525
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:14,080
I've never played Tony Hawk.

526
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:15,680
Pickle Rick, Baby Yoda.

527
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:18,880
I don't know who else.

528
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:20,880
Jared fucking, Jared Kushner.

529
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:23,600
Jared Kushner's in there, he's playable.

530
00:23:24,560 --> 00:23:26,640
And he's smoking weed and that's like the thing,

531
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:28,720
you know, he's got all the tricks.

532
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:29,840
Fucking Billy Crystal.

533
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:32,080
He's doing crystal meth.

534
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:34,480
Graham Roebuck sent this question in.

535
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:35,040
Thank you, Graham.

536
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:37,600
It's yahoo answers user Savannah who asks,

537
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:38,800
and this is a good question.

538
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:43,920
How do surgeons remember each step during surgery?

539
00:23:43,920 --> 00:23:44,480
Thank you.

540
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:48,400
How do they remember each step when they perform a surgery

541
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:51,280
updated one day ago, but sometimes your brain can forget things

542
00:23:51,280 --> 00:23:53,120
and you can't always remember everything?

543
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:56,480
Really walking us through the concept of the question there.

544
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:57,600
But taking our hand.

545
00:23:57,600 --> 00:23:58,800
I appreciate that.

546
00:23:58,800 --> 00:24:02,960
In the last two weeks, I have baked six loaves of sourdough.

547
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:09,280
And each time I have had to check the steps of the recipe.

548
00:24:09,280 --> 00:24:12,080
Fucking same sees with literally everything I cook.

549
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:15,280
I have cooked a curry out of a box

550
00:24:15,280 --> 00:24:19,200
probably close to 100 times at this point in my life.

551
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:21,360
Every time still though, I get out that box like,

552
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:23,040
how much water you put in it?

553
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:26,880
I should, I know it, but I'm so afraid to ruin dinner.

554
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:30,080
And this is like ruining a pancreas or something

555
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:31,840
like a human pancreas.

556
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:35,920
Now, Trav, you said you bake six loaves of bread

557
00:24:35,920 --> 00:24:37,440
and you still have to look at the recipe.

558
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:38,240
Correct.

559
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:42,720
If a surgeon told me this is the sixth one of these I've done,

560
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:44,560
I don't need to look at anything.

561
00:24:44,560 --> 00:24:45,440
That wouldn't fill me.

562
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:47,760
Six is not like a lot.

563
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:51,920
Okay, but just in counterpoint, if you go in

564
00:24:51,920 --> 00:24:54,320
and like before you go in, the surgeon's like,

565
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:57,840
I do need to set up a little like music stand here

566
00:24:57,840 --> 00:25:00,240
with some step-by-steps on it.

567
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:01,920
I don't think you'd be like, cool, cool.

568
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:03,120
Let's do this, doc.

569
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:04,560
Awesome, cool.

570
00:25:04,560 --> 00:25:06,400
That's why they have the fucking earpiece in.

571
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:08,320
What?

572
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:09,360
You never noticed that?

573
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:13,280
They got an earpiece, every surgeon has.

574
00:25:13,280 --> 00:25:14,000
And then they got it.

575
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,800
There's a boss surgeon telling them

576
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:18,400
the different things they have to do

577
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:21,920
and occasionally ribbled jokes.

578
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:22,480
Oh my God.

579
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:24,160
And the mood is dour.

580
00:25:24,160 --> 00:25:25,440
Here's the problem.

581
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:26,800
Justin's married to a doctor.

582
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:28,560
I have no idea if this is true or not.

583
00:25:28,560 --> 00:25:29,060
Yeah.

584
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:34,000
All right, Dr. Bibbin, it's me, your favorite supporter.

585
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:35,120
Sorry, Dr. Bibbin?

586
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:38,080
Dr. Bibbin and I'm here on support

587
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:41,360
and this time I thought I would deliver the steps to you

588
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:44,400
in the form of a very fun rap that I have written.

589
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:48,240
So it goes a little something like this.

590
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:50,640
Tracheotomy, not a lobotomy.

591
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:52,720
Cut that throat and cross the moat.

592
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:55,520
That's what I call the river of blood.

593
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:58,960
If you've made a river of blood, clean it up.

594
00:25:58,960 --> 00:25:59,760
Get it out.

595
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:00,560
They've died.

596
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:03,360
Oh, I skipped a step.

597
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:04,720
Oh no.

598
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:07,680
There has to be a moment, right?

599
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:11,840
Even if it's like your 300th time performing that surgery

600
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:15,360
that maybe you're like, it's like after you've driven a route

601
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:17,360
a lot of times where like suddenly you're just home

602
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:19,680
and you're like, huh.

603
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:20,640
Absolutely not.

604
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:22,240
I hope to fuck you wrong.

605
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:24,080
I hope to fuck you wrong.

606
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:26,480
I know what you're saying, Travis, and like point taken

607
00:26:27,040 --> 00:26:30,400
but I absolutely hope you are 100% correct.

608
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:31,120
I guarantee that.

609
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:34,000
The last thing I need is the dude's like,

610
00:26:34,560 --> 00:26:37,120
hey, I know this gallbladder is giving you problems

611
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:40,240
but I'm putting this bitch on cruise control.

612
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:40,960
That's the thing, right?

613
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:43,600
There has to come a point where like it's an hour later

614
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:46,080
and they're like, I did that one thing, right?

615
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:49,040
Yeah, yeah, no, I definitely did.

616
00:26:49,040 --> 00:26:51,120
I just, it's a terrible picture you've painted, Travis.

617
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:54,880
If I was a doctor, if I have to drill a hole in my house

618
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:58,000
in the wall of a house to like put in a drywall anchor

619
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:02,560
or something like that, I check my shit a hundred,

620
00:27:02,560 --> 00:27:04,320
like I will have marked it with a pencil

621
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:07,120
and have the drill bit up against it and stop and be like,

622
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:08,560
let me just do the stud finder.

623
00:27:08,560 --> 00:27:10,000
Let me just check this again.

624
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:10,720
Let me check this again.

625
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:13,360
Cause once I put this hole in my wall,

626
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:17,760
that is going to be a hard thing to undo.

627
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:21,200
I'm imagining me with scalpel on somebody's like arm

628
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:24,160
or whatever, just like, and it is this arm, right?

629
00:27:24,160 --> 00:27:25,680
They wanted it on arm.

630
00:27:25,680 --> 00:27:27,840
There's something bad with arm, okay.

631
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:31,920
Imagine waking up, you were put under

632
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:34,240
for a gallbladder surgery and now you're waking up

633
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:35,920
from the anesthesia and you're like, how did it go?

634
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:38,240
And the doctor's like, you know, I didn't do it.

635
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:41,360
I think I just need a little more time to get ready

636
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:43,280
to just get in the right head space.

637
00:27:43,280 --> 00:27:44,560
We're going to do it tomorrow.

638
00:27:44,560 --> 00:27:45,760
I fucking chickened out.

639
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:46,480
I'm sorry.

640
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:49,120
I got in there and everything was so wet and red.

641
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:51,040
I just bailed, I'm sorry.

642
00:27:51,040 --> 00:27:52,960
I had a tutorial up on the YouTube,

643
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:55,280
but our internet's being so weird today.

644
00:27:57,120 --> 00:27:59,600
It was really laggy and I was so,

645
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:03,440
and then I got a pop-up for like how to make the best pesto.

646
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:05,920
And I was like, I do want to find out about pesto.

647
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:09,040
And one thing led to another and I went down a deep rabbit hole

648
00:28:09,040 --> 00:28:10,080
and now you're awake.

649
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:11,280
Oh, let me sew you up.

650
00:28:11,280 --> 00:28:12,000
Sorry, sorry, sorry.

651
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:12,960
Oh shit, shit, shit.

652
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:15,040
No, but they can't get mad at you.

653
00:28:15,040 --> 00:28:18,880
It's like, wait, you didn't know how to take out a gallbladder

654
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:20,560
and it's like, well, I sure as fuck knew better

655
00:28:20,560 --> 00:28:22,560
than you would have done it at home.

656
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:24,320
It's definitely better than that.

657
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:26,880
I did a better job than you would have done.

658
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:31,520
It's a thing that at some point you are some surgeon's,

659
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:34,560
let's say third patient, not their first

660
00:28:34,560 --> 00:28:36,560
because that's scary right there.

661
00:28:36,560 --> 00:28:38,800
But they've practiced, they've done this.

662
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:42,960
They had like, every surgeon has to have their first time

663
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:44,640
without training wheels, right?

664
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:45,200
Yeah, sure.

665
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:47,360
Sure, I guess.

666
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:49,520
But anyways, trust doctors, that is very important.

667
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:51,280
Trust doctors, it is important,

668
00:28:51,280 --> 00:28:53,600
but there has to be a first time, right?

669
00:28:54,800 --> 00:28:55,360
Here's a fix.

670
00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:57,600
No, I want to talk about this.

671
00:28:57,600 --> 00:28:58,160
Okay.

672
00:28:58,160 --> 00:29:02,320
The first time, I think basically the way it works is like this.

673
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:06,400
You have a big doctor and there's a little doctor.

674
00:29:06,400 --> 00:29:06,640
Right.

675
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:10,000
And at first, the little doctor is like standing

676
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:13,440
on the big doctor's feet and the big doctor's holding

677
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:15,840
their hands and doing all the cutting for them, right?

678
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:16,240
Yeah.

679
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:19,200
And then they keep doing surgery after surgery.

680
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:23,520
And then just one time they like look behind them

681
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:27,680
and they realize that the big doctor is now in the bathroom.

682
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:29,280
Now they're the big doctor.

683
00:29:29,280 --> 00:29:31,360
They slipped away in the night.

684
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:32,320
They're dead?

685
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:33,440
You're the doctor now.

686
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:34,400
They were never alive.

687
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:34,720
Oh.

688
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:36,880
They were actually alive in this one.

689
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:38,400
In this one, they were alive.

690
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:39,520
That's a basic idea.

691
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:43,840
It's basically like the bicycle, like learning to ride a bike.

692
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:46,000
Like the big doctor is holding your waist

693
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,080
and then you are doing the entire surgery

694
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:50,080
and you realize like they let go already

695
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:51,600
and you're just like still doing it.

696
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:53,760
But if you're not ready, then you just kind of scalpel,

697
00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:54,480
just rip.

698
00:29:56,160 --> 00:29:57,520
I can't do it.

699
00:29:57,520 --> 00:30:00,240
And then you fast forward to the big doctor walking

700
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:02,800
the little doctor down the aisle and giving them away

701
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:04,880
at their wedding and then their first dance.

702
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:06,640
And once again, the little doctor

703
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:09,920
stands on a big doctor's feet and they dance.

704
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:10,640
Oh, that's good.

705
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:13,520
Let me hit you guys with this solution to this problem

706
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:16,000
that this Yahoo Answers user has pointed out for us.

707
00:30:16,560 --> 00:30:18,720
I think doctors probably forget the steps of surgeries

708
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:20,400
all the time and need cue cards or whatever.

709
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:23,840
And I think one way around that is

710
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:28,080
if each procedure that could be done

711
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:31,280
had just the one doctor that could do it

712
00:30:31,280 --> 00:30:34,160
and they're the only one.

713
00:30:34,160 --> 00:30:36,800
So like if you need your tonsils out,

714
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:42,160
they would call Dr. Tonsils.

715
00:30:42,160 --> 00:30:47,280
And it's a weird coincidence that that was doctor's name,

716
00:30:47,280 --> 00:30:48,880
but she would just roll up and be like,

717
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:50,400
hello, I'm Dr. Tonsils.

718
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:51,680
I know I look like Ms. Frizzle,

719
00:30:51,680 --> 00:30:53,200
but let's get those bad boys out.

720
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:56,720
I've done this 659,000 times.

721
00:30:56,720 --> 00:30:59,200
I have a big sack full of tonsils

722
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:00,880
that I carry around with me.

723
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:02,480
If you have a heart attack,

724
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:04,400
it'll be like, uh-oh, call Dr. Heart Attack.

725
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:05,520
And he would roll up and be like,

726
00:31:05,520 --> 00:31:07,440
I do the heart attack surgery.

727
00:31:08,560 --> 00:31:10,400
I think that this is why you have,

728
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:13,680
to be unfunny for a moment,

729
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:18,560
highly trained nurses and other doctors in the room

730
00:31:18,560 --> 00:31:21,760
so that when you skip maybe steps six and seven,

731
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:22,800
there's somebody going,

732
00:31:22,800 --> 00:31:25,520
hey, you're gonna tie that off, right?

733
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:28,000
I mean, you were going to.

734
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:29,360
You definitely were going to.

735
00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:30,160
I just wanted to say it.

736
00:31:30,160 --> 00:31:31,200
You're gonna tie that off, right?

737
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:33,600
A bit of it of the doubt.

738
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:34,720
Listen, we're not doctors.

739
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:37,680
We have to make our money the honest way around here.

740
00:31:37,680 --> 00:31:38,800
We can't rely on big podcasters.

741
00:31:38,800 --> 00:31:41,040
I consider myself a bit of a podcast doctor.

742
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:43,120
Okay, that's interesting.

743
00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:44,720
Oh, you've handed me a business card here.

744
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:46,960
Yep, that's what it says, podcast doctor.

745
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:48,240
That's a little bizarre.

746
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:50,080
For a while, it said doctor podcast,

747
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:51,040
but that was misleading.

748
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:53,520
I'm something of a joke surgeon, aren't I?

749
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:57,280
I get in there with my precision and my scalpel.

750
00:31:58,160 --> 00:31:59,920
Justin, anything you'd like to add?

751
00:31:59,920 --> 00:32:01,280
Justin, any sort of funny joke?

752
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:02,080
I'd like to say this.

753
00:32:03,040 --> 00:32:03,920
Let's go to the Mighty Nein.

754
00:32:13,680 --> 00:32:15,440
I'm a comedy anesthesiologist

755
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:17,440
because my jokes put people to sleep.

756
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:18,480
Hey, that's good, Trav.

757
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:20,400
I mean, it's not.

758
00:32:20,400 --> 00:32:21,600
I wish they didn't.

759
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:23,200
It wasn't something I was aiming for.

760
00:32:25,040 --> 00:32:26,640
I want to tell you about stamps.com.

761
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:29,360
Can you get a little bit of enthusiasm?

762
00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:32,560
I want to tell you about stamps.com.

763
00:32:32,560 --> 00:32:33,360
No, this is cool.

764
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:34,480
Do the whole thing like this.

765
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:38,640
For all our sakes, we need to avoid crowds.

766
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:39,360
Who's this?

767
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:41,680
This is the guy who loves stamps.com.

768
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:43,600
Come up with a name.

769
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:45,280
His name is-

770
00:32:45,280 --> 00:32:46,800
Don't say Dr. Stamps.

771
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:47,360
Roger.

772
00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:48,400
Yeah.

773
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:49,600
Rabbit.

774
00:32:50,560 --> 00:32:50,880
Okay.

775
00:32:51,520 --> 00:32:53,360
No relations, spelled different.

776
00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:55,680
R-A-B-E-T, rabbit.

777
00:32:55,680 --> 00:32:56,880
And Roger is spelled-

778
00:32:56,880 --> 00:32:58,480
This ad sucks.

779
00:32:58,480 --> 00:32:59,600
Okay.

780
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:00,800
Okay, listen.

781
00:33:00,800 --> 00:33:02,000
We need to avoid crowds.

782
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:03,120
Listen, listen to me.

783
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:03,600
Listen to me.

784
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:04,160
Are you listening?

785
00:33:04,160 --> 00:33:05,600
We need to avoid crowds at all costs,

786
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:06,720
any way we can right now.

787
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:09,760
But what if you need to go to the post office?

788
00:33:09,760 --> 00:33:12,640
What if you need postage to send out a letter and package?

789
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:14,000
Don't worry.

790
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:15,520

What'd you guys think?

819
00:34:25,680 --> 00:34:26,560
Good, man. Good, man.

820
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:27,200
You got the job.

821
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:28,640
You got me fucking hyphy.

822
00:34:28,640 --> 00:34:29,920
I want to tell you about Stitch Fix.

823
00:34:29,920 --> 00:34:32,320
It's a box of clothes that will come to your house

824
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:36,160
and you're going to work with a personal stylist

825
00:34:36,160 --> 00:34:39,040
who is real and you're going to tell them

826
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:42,640
what looks good on you, what kind of shapes you are.

827
00:34:42,640 --> 00:34:44,320
Hey Griffin, can I give you just a quick note?

828
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:45,040
Mm-hmm.

829
00:34:45,840 --> 00:34:47,520
Like my, okay, for my ad,

830
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:49,280
like I created kind of like a rich fiction.

831
00:34:49,840 --> 00:34:50,640
Sure, yeah.

832
00:34:50,640 --> 00:34:53,040
What the situation was, kind of what my character was.

833
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:55,120
Like you could picture me like in a foxhole.

834
00:34:55,120 --> 00:34:55,920
But that's your thing.

835
00:34:55,920 --> 00:34:58,800
Like the reason people like me and what I bring to the show

836
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:01,200
is that like my guy like doesn't give a fuck.

837
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:02,240
And people like, like-

838
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:03,360
Oh, could you play that up then?

839
00:35:04,080 --> 00:35:06,320
I'm saying there's like a type of overachiever

840
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:08,160
that like really goes for the type of vibe

841
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:08,800
that you're laying down.

842
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:10,800
But then there's a bunch of like kind of cool

843
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:15,520
like slacker, like stoner, fucking skeezy weirdo.

844
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:17,120
I think you could slack more then.

845
00:35:17,120 --> 00:35:18,640
Could you give me a little more slack, please?

846
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:20,080
Yeah, okay, I'll start over.

847
00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:23,760
Oh, clothes.

848
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:25,280
Clothes, I get it.

849
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:29,760
But Stitch Fix is great for this.

850
00:35:32,560 --> 00:35:35,440
You're gonna tell a website what kind of shapes you are.

851
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:37,440
No, it's cool.

852
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:39,200
It's whatever.

853
00:35:40,080 --> 00:35:42,560
And then a personal stylist.

854
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:46,800
And that sounds so like grown up, I get it.

855
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:49,040
But it's, trust me, it's cash.

856
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:51,920
They're gonna set you up nice.

857
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:56,000
Colors, styles, budget, and a $20 styling fee.

858
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:59,040
But it's credited towards anything you keep.

859
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:03,840
Anyway, there's no subscription required,

860
00:36:03,840 --> 00:36:06,480
which is cool because we hate subscriptions, don't we?

861
00:36:07,360 --> 00:36:09,920
And they have shipping and returns.

862
00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:13,600
So you can get started to-

863
00:36:15,600 --> 00:36:19,120
The shipping and returns and exchanges are easy and free.

864
00:36:19,120 --> 00:36:20,480
Like everything should be.

865
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:22,720

00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:54,400
Oh, we all use it.

877
00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:57,200
And that we all, I might say,

878
00:36:57,200 --> 00:36:59,840
we all have personal experience with Stitch Fix.

879
00:36:59,840 --> 00:37:02,000
I'm wearing Stitch Fix pants right now.

880
00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:06,000
Wow, and I'm wearing Travis's Stitch Fix pants also.

881
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:06,320
What?

882
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:07,200
I'm in this pocket.

883
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:08,320
Hey!

884
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:09,840
Hey.

885
00:37:09,840 --> 00:37:10,400
What's up?

886
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:12,880
I'm also wearing your buns.

887
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:13,200
Cool.

888
00:37:15,360 --> 00:37:17,600
Hey, Max Funsters, it's Jesse Thorne.

889
00:37:17,600 --> 00:37:20,320
This week on my public radio interview show Bullseye,

890
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:22,960
I'm talking with Tina Fey and Robert Karloch

891
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:25,360
about creating Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt,

892
00:37:25,360 --> 00:37:29,360
30 Rock, and also just kind of why they're the best at everything.

893
00:37:29,360 --> 00:37:33,200
There was a window of time when we used to go to awards things

894
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:36,400
and pick up our prizes and party with the people from Mad Men.

895
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:39,200
You can find Bullseye at maximumfun.org

896
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:42,160
or wherever you listen to podcasts.

897
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:48,880
Just search for Bullseye with Jesse Thorne.

898
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:56,080
Huh?

899
00:37:58,720 --> 00:38:00,160
Did that come from my pocket?

900
00:38:00,160 --> 00:38:00,880
Open your pocket.

901
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:01,360
Oh, okay.

902
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:06,720
I want a munch.

903
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:08,000
Squad!

904
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:12,160
But I want too much.

905
00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:12,960
Squad!

906
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:18,000
Welcome to Munch Squad, it's a podcast within a podcast.

907
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:18,720
Within a pocket.

908
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:20,400
Within a pocket.

909
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:22,880
This is Throwback Munch Squad,

910
00:38:23,680 --> 00:38:29,200
which is a podcast mini-series within a podcast within a podcast

911
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:34,560
where we talk about the real latest

912
00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:40,160
because they're very old, they're very old ads

913
00:38:40,160 --> 00:38:42,640
because no one is making new food anymore.

914
00:38:42,640 --> 00:38:48,000
And the ones that are are depressing and not funny anymore.

915
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:49,360
They used to be very funny.

916
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:52,000
Fast food chains, kids don't remember,

917
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:54,880
but fast food chains used to do silly things

918
00:38:54,880 --> 00:38:56,320
and now they just do boring things.

919
00:38:56,320 --> 00:38:58,160
Like if I go to one of my old sources,

920
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:02,080
here's one of the headers.

921
00:39:02,080 --> 00:39:06,160
Brewster's real ice cream adds sweet and salty treats to menus.

922
00:39:06,160 --> 00:39:06,400
Right?

923
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:07,680
That seems fine.

924
00:39:07,680 --> 00:39:09,760
Very first sentence of this press release is

925
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:15,760
with the effects of coronavirus, COVID-19, still top of mind,

926
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:18,400
creating new routines and traditions can be restorative.

927
00:39:19,360 --> 00:39:21,440
Hey, are you just selling ice cream?

928
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:22,240
Are you?

929
00:39:22,240 --> 00:39:24,480
Because I think you need to calm down.

930
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:26,560
I'm trying to have fun over here with the Munch Squad.

931
00:39:26,560 --> 00:39:26,880
Yeah.

932
00:39:27,600 --> 00:39:30,480
So we are gonna head on back,

933
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:35,200
get in the way back machine, April 16th, 2001.

934
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:39,120
This is from Oliver and I very much appreciate it.

935
00:39:40,160 --> 00:39:42,480
Arby's has appetite for adults.

936
00:39:47,040 --> 00:39:47,520
All right.

937
00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:48,080
Oh no.

938
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:51,280
This is maybe the sexiest Munch Squad I've ever done.

939
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:52,640
So hang in there with me.

940
00:39:53,360 --> 00:39:56,320
With its adult positioning now established,

941
00:39:56,320 --> 00:40:02,320
Arby's is testing an advertising approach designed for mature audiences.

942
00:40:04,160 --> 00:40:06,720
The quick service chain is once again,

943
00:40:06,720 --> 00:40:10,800
tapping the star power of R&B crooner, Barry White.

944
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:13,680
Only this time as a new character,

945
00:40:13,680 --> 00:40:16,880
the company refers to as Appetite Man.

946
00:40:18,320 --> 00:40:19,200
Shit, yeah.

947
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:25,920
Aimed at touting the crave appeal of the chain's menu,

948
00:40:26,720 --> 00:40:30,720
Arby's created, see these days we say craveability.

949
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:33,840
That's how far we've come in these 19 years.

950
00:40:33,840 --> 00:40:36,560
Arby's created a character it thought would represent how,

951
00:40:36,560 --> 00:40:42,640
quote, passionate, seductive, and discriminating a person's appetite might be.

952
00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:43,760
I know what you're saying.

953
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:46,880
Is this the same person that's driving into Arby's?

954
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:49,280
And the answer is yes, it is.

955
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:53,760
The Appetite urges you to act on your real desires

956
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:58,480
and not settle for ordinary fast food because your appetite wants the best.

957
00:40:59,120 --> 00:41:00,560
They don't finish the sentence,

958
00:41:00,560 --> 00:41:04,960
but I'm assuming it ends with thing that is available at Arby's.

959
00:41:05,680 --> 00:41:08,800
The best thing that they have on the menu of Arby's.

960
00:41:09,520 --> 00:41:13,920
So what better personification of what the company refers to as,

961
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:17,760
quote, passion, love, and seduction than Mr. White?

962
00:41:18,880 --> 00:41:22,320
The singer was also a natural choice since the company

963
00:41:22,320 --> 00:41:25,760
already had good results using him in its 99 campaign.

964
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:31,440
This is fucking so wild that someone's like three years after the fact like,

965
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:35,040
can we try Barry White again and this time we'll call him Appetite Man?

966
00:41:35,840 --> 00:41:37,280
And that person got promoted.

967
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:44,240
So is the idea that you watch it and his singing makes you horny,

968
00:41:44,240 --> 00:41:48,400
but because you're watching the Arby's commercial it's kind of a coin flip

969
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:51,680
of whether you will feel like wanting to have sex with a human being

970
00:41:51,680 --> 00:41:54,400
or wanting to go eat a beef and cheddar max?

971
00:41:54,400 --> 00:41:54,880
Or both!

972
00:41:54,880 --> 00:42:01,040
Actually, in this specific situation, I have the only,

973
00:42:01,040 --> 00:42:05,360
they describe what the ads they're making for test markets are, right?

974
00:42:05,360 --> 00:42:07,360
Okay.

975
00:42:08,240 --> 00:42:14,000
And these are, there's only one actual ad that they made

976
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:16,560
with Appetite Man that I could actually find.

977
00:42:16,560 --> 00:42:18,080
So we're gonna take 30 seconds to listen to that

978
00:42:18,080 --> 00:42:21,680
and then I'm gonna describe the other wild ones that they had in store.

979
00:42:21,680 --> 00:42:22,720
So here's this first.

980
00:42:23,360 --> 00:42:27,520
This is your Appetite Talking and this is a tasty alert.

981
00:42:27,520 --> 00:42:29,840
You're not gonna believe this baby.

982
00:42:29,840 --> 00:42:33,200
Right now, five Arby's roast beefs are just $5.95.

983
00:42:33,200 --> 00:42:35,280
Oh, that slow roasted beef.

984
00:42:36,080 --> 00:42:40,640
So tender, so juicy, and those sauces.

985
00:42:40,640 --> 00:42:42,320
That's what you want, baby.

986
00:42:42,320 --> 00:42:46,560
Get five Arby's regular roast beef sandwiches for just $5.95, but not for long.

987
00:42:47,120 --> 00:42:50,560
If you want the tasty, you gotta be hasty.

988
00:42:50,560 --> 00:42:52,640
Give in to your grown-up tastes.

989
00:42:53,680 --> 00:42:54,320
That's cool.

990
00:42:54,320 --> 00:42:58,560
I think that it is nice to know that for under six dollars

991
00:42:58,560 --> 00:43:04,480
I could potentially permanently halt my entire gastrointestinal process

992
00:43:04,480 --> 00:43:06,000
for the rest of my life.

993
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:08,160
Five Arby's, five of those bad boys.

994
00:43:08,160 --> 00:43:11,760
Five is, hey Barry, five is so many.

995
00:43:11,760 --> 00:43:13,040
Oh my gosh, it's a lot.

996
00:43:13,680 --> 00:43:16,080
And there is no point in that commercial where he's like,

997
00:43:16,080 --> 00:43:17,760
and share them with a friend.

998
00:43:18,400 --> 00:43:22,000
Like it's just for me, I think, to eat these five sandwiches.

999
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:23,600
If I put five of them in me,

1000
00:43:23,600 --> 00:43:25,840
the organs inside me that make the poop happen

1001
00:43:25,840 --> 00:43:29,120
would look at each other like that's it.

1002
00:43:30,240 --> 00:43:33,040
In the commercials, the soul singer invades people's lives

1003
00:43:33,040 --> 00:43:37,280
with the Pavlovian timing to personify their hunger pains,

1004
00:43:37,280 --> 00:43:38,720
first as a voice,

1005
00:43:38,720 --> 00:43:41,840
then appearing in miniature in the amazed person's stomach.

1006
00:43:42,480 --> 00:43:46,560
This is so fucking unfair that I don't have the, it's so,

1007
00:43:47,520 --> 00:43:50,560
quote, there's a little Barry in all of us,

1008
00:43:50,560 --> 00:43:51,840
says Scott Lippitt,

1009
00:43:51,840 --> 00:43:56,080
exec VP group account director on Arby's.

1010
00:43:56,080 --> 00:43:58,400
In one spot, a man is driving his wife,

1011
00:43:58,400 --> 00:44:00,320
obviously in labor, to the hospital.

1012
00:44:00,880 --> 00:44:03,040
Suddenly he hears Mr. White say,

1013
00:44:03,040 --> 00:44:06,080
hey baby, we're in the mood for something tasty.

1014
00:44:06,640 --> 00:44:09,440
The expectant father looks down at his stomach

1015
00:44:09,440 --> 00:44:13,200
and sees Mr. White who says, this is your appetite, baby.

1016
00:44:13,200 --> 00:44:14,960
You gotta give into love.

1017
00:44:14,960 --> 00:44:18,160
The dad-to-be now asks, but do we have time?

1018
00:44:18,160 --> 00:44:21,760
The appetite man has the answer, drive through.

1019
00:44:21,760 --> 00:44:24,320
The spot closes with the wife driving

1020
00:44:24,320 --> 00:44:25,680
while the husband eats.

1021
00:44:25,680 --> 00:44:26,180
Wow.

1022
00:44:27,600 --> 00:44:28,800
Oh, wow.

1023
00:44:28,800 --> 00:44:32,960
Do you know how wild it is that in this spot,

1024
00:44:32,960 --> 00:44:36,000
there's a man whose wife is in the passenger seat

1025
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:39,120
with a small baby in her stomach

1026
00:44:39,120 --> 00:44:40,800
and then this man discovers

1027
00:44:40,800 --> 00:44:43,200
that a small Barry White lives in his stomach?

1028
00:44:43,200 --> 00:44:44,240
He's grown up.

1029
00:44:44,240 --> 00:44:45,440
How has that played out?

1030
00:44:45,440 --> 00:44:47,520
Do you think when he looks the fate,

1031
00:44:47,520 --> 00:44:49,280
like is it just CGI'd in

1032
00:44:49,280 --> 00:44:53,600
or is it like Barry White's face is the stomach?

1033
00:44:53,600 --> 00:44:54,560
It's practical.

1034
00:44:54,560 --> 00:44:56,160
I bet it's Barry White in a diaper,

1035
00:44:56,160 --> 00:44:57,840
just like a big baby Barry White.

1036
00:44:58,640 --> 00:45:01,920
A second effort takes a direct shot at McDonald's

1037
00:45:02,560 --> 00:45:06,000
where Mr. White asks, which is very good,

1038
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:10,080
Mr. White asks, hey baby, why are you eating that clown food?

1039
00:45:10,080 --> 00:45:11,200
Oh, wow.

1040
00:45:11,200 --> 00:45:11,700
Yeah.

1041
00:45:12,560 --> 00:45:13,280
Get him.

1042
00:45:13,280 --> 00:45:14,960
Sick burn, dog.

1043
00:45:14,960 --> 00:45:18,160
So, uh, appetite man is a campaign

1044
00:45:18,160 --> 00:45:21,120
that I'm guessing they just chicken out on

1045
00:45:21,120 --> 00:45:23,680
because everything's on YouTube and this is not.

1046
00:45:24,320 --> 00:45:28,160
So, uh, that seems unfair to me personally,

1047
00:45:28,160 --> 00:45:30,000
so I don't think they ever actually went through with it.

1048
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:32,080
Will you read the first line of the presser again?

1049
00:45:32,960 --> 00:45:33,840
Sure, bud.

1050
00:45:33,840 --> 00:45:34,560
I'm happy to.

1051
00:45:35,120 --> 00:45:37,360
With its adult positioning now established.

1052
00:45:37,360 --> 00:45:38,320
By what?

1053
00:45:38,320 --> 00:45:38,960
Like what?

1054
00:45:39,760 --> 00:45:40,960
What the fuck did they do?

1055
00:45:40,960 --> 00:45:43,040
Did they establish their adult positioning

1056
00:45:43,040 --> 00:45:45,120
with the headline of this press release

1057
00:45:45,120 --> 00:45:46,160
or were they doing,

1058
00:45:46,160 --> 00:45:48,560
were they like sexing it up a little bit?

1059
00:45:48,560 --> 00:45:51,280
Actually, let's drill down on this for a second.

1060
00:45:51,280 --> 00:45:51,760
Yeah.

1061
00:45:51,760 --> 00:45:54,640
With its adult positioning now established,

1062
00:45:55,520 --> 00:45:57,760
Arby's is testing and advertising a purge

1063
00:45:57,760 --> 00:45:59,520
designed for mature audiences.

1064
00:46:00,160 --> 00:46:03,520
So what, what is happening?

1065
00:46:03,520 --> 00:46:05,840
Are you saying that adults love it so much

1066
00:46:05,840 --> 00:46:09,680
that we're just gonna make sexy ads for adults now?

1067
00:46:09,680 --> 00:46:10,560
Is that the way it works?

1068
00:46:10,560 --> 00:46:13,040
If I may take it one step further

1069
00:46:13,040 --> 00:46:15,520
and go before the comment,

1070
00:46:15,520 --> 00:46:18,160
was there a time where people were like,

1071
00:46:18,160 --> 00:46:20,560
Arby's, that's only for kids.

1072
00:46:20,560 --> 00:46:24,560
That's kid, that's a three quarter pound pile of meat.

1073
00:46:24,560 --> 00:46:25,360
That's just for kids.

1074
00:46:25,360 --> 00:46:26,480
Arby's is for kids.

1075
00:46:27,120 --> 00:46:28,160
That's kids stuff.

1076
00:46:28,160 --> 00:46:30,880
What kind of grown adult would eat Arby's?

1077
00:46:31,680 --> 00:46:34,480
Us grownups like thick slices of beef.

1078
00:46:36,080 --> 00:46:37,600
These tissue papers thin.

1079
00:46:37,600 --> 00:46:39,280
Give me a slab.

1080
00:46:39,280 --> 00:46:41,120
What are you talking about?

1081
00:46:41,120 --> 00:46:44,320
I want a fine food restaurant that sells cigarettes.

1082
00:46:44,320 --> 00:46:46,400
That's my five-year-old nephew,

1083
00:46:46,400 --> 00:46:48,720
Gorfus loves jamoca shakes.

1084
00:46:48,720 --> 00:46:51,680
Those curly fries, too whimsical.

1085
00:46:51,680 --> 00:46:53,040
They put them around their fingers.

1086
00:46:53,040 --> 00:46:54,240
That's why they make them curly

1087
00:46:54,240 --> 00:46:56,240
so fucking kids can do that.

1088
00:46:56,240 --> 00:46:58,400
I want adult food for a man.

1089
00:46:58,400 --> 00:47:00,320
Give me some horny food.

1090
00:47:00,320 --> 00:47:02,720
I have horny adult food cravings

1091
00:47:02,720 --> 00:47:07,600
and Arby's with its thin slices of meat can't satisfy it.

1092
00:47:08,160 --> 00:47:12,720
I have a dark passenger that craves them meaty slabs

1093
00:47:12,720 --> 00:47:15,120
that I can really bite into.

1094
00:47:16,560 --> 00:47:17,760
Fucking motts sticks?

1095
00:47:17,760 --> 00:47:20,720
They might as well be pacifiers for babies

1096
00:47:20,720 --> 00:47:23,360
because I'm an adult and I don't eat that kind of shit.

1097
00:47:23,360 --> 00:47:24,240
Now what's this?

1098
00:47:24,240 --> 00:47:25,440
Barry White likes it?

1099
00:47:26,080 --> 00:47:27,360
Well, hold on now.

1100
00:47:27,920 --> 00:47:28,960
Hold on.

1101
00:47:28,960 --> 00:47:30,400
If my favorite singer,

1102
00:47:32,160 --> 00:47:37,520
if my favorite singer in 2001, Barry White likes Arby's,

1103
00:47:37,520 --> 00:47:41,840
maybe he wouldn't throw in with some fucking kid food.

1104
00:47:41,840 --> 00:47:42,320
No.

1105
00:47:42,320 --> 00:47:44,320
This is food for grown adults.

1106
00:47:44,320 --> 00:47:45,440
I trust him.

1107
00:47:45,440 --> 00:47:47,040
He knows sex.

1108
00:47:47,040 --> 00:47:49,920
This is a passion project by Mr. White.

1109
00:47:49,920 --> 00:47:51,520
Emphasis on the passion.

1110
00:47:52,800 --> 00:47:55,600
I went lots of places to fuck this sandwich.

1111
00:47:55,600 --> 00:47:56,240
Look at it.

1112
00:47:57,040 --> 00:47:58,000
Put it anywhere.

1113
00:47:59,040 --> 00:48:01,120
Barry, that always a stick to the coffee, Barry.

1114
00:48:02,160 --> 00:48:05,040
Listen, when you stack up this many slices

1115
00:48:05,040 --> 00:48:07,840
of delicious roast beef,

1116
00:48:07,840 --> 00:48:09,840
the odds are somewhere on it,

1117
00:48:09,840 --> 00:48:12,320
it will look like genitalia.

1118
00:48:12,320 --> 00:48:13,760
All right, Barry, if you could just read,

1119
00:48:13,760 --> 00:48:16,400
it's the guy's driving his wife to-

1120
00:48:16,400 --> 00:48:20,320
I got one of the sesame seeds from the buns

1121
00:48:20,320 --> 00:48:21,920
right in my pee hole.

1122
00:48:21,920 --> 00:48:23,120
That's not sexy.

1123
00:48:23,920 --> 00:48:26,880
Baby, I don't know what is.

1124
00:48:26,880 --> 00:48:29,120
Slather that up in horsey sauce.

1125
00:48:29,120 --> 00:48:29,840
And oh, nope.

1126
00:48:29,840 --> 00:48:33,040
The tanginess of the sauce does not feel good.

1127
00:48:33,040 --> 00:48:34,080
No, Mr. White, please.

1128
00:48:34,080 --> 00:48:36,320
It just says drive through, baby.

1129
00:48:37,040 --> 00:48:39,280
Let me rub your feet in au jus.

1130
00:48:39,280 --> 00:48:42,160
Oh, okay, now you're actually doing that to me?

1131
00:48:43,920 --> 00:48:45,120
Yeah, baby.

1132
00:48:45,120 --> 00:48:46,320
Mr. White, I am-

1133
00:48:46,320 --> 00:48:47,200
Sexual.

1134
00:48:47,200 --> 00:48:48,000
Very comfortable.

1135
00:48:49,840 --> 00:48:51,120
Sexy Arby's food.

1136
00:48:52,720 --> 00:48:55,600
Arby's is still for adults and kids alike.

1137
00:48:55,600 --> 00:48:59,040
And I really appreciate them sponsoring this episode.

1138
00:48:59,040 --> 00:49:02,000
It's a co-branded episode between them and Buick.

1139
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:03,760
No, we couldn't get Buick.

1140
00:49:03,760 --> 00:49:05,280
We couldn't get Buick.

1141
00:49:05,280 --> 00:49:10,880
I would fucking put a stick of dynamite in my car

1142
00:49:10,880 --> 00:49:12,640
and blow it up and never have it again

1143
00:49:12,640 --> 00:49:14,720
to eat one beef and cheddar right now.

1144
00:49:14,720 --> 00:49:15,760
I'm looking at a picture-

1145
00:49:15,760 --> 00:49:18,720
I'm confronting an enormous picture of one right now.

1146
00:49:22,960 --> 00:49:25,760
I have a cheap kill bill replica sword

1147
00:49:25,760 --> 00:49:28,800
my friend got me at an anime convention a few years ago,

1148
00:49:28,800 --> 00:49:31,200
but due to neglect slash terrible craftsmanship,

1149
00:49:31,200 --> 00:49:32,800
it has started to fall apart.

1150
00:49:32,800 --> 00:49:35,200
It's not sharp, but it is a real sword.

1151
00:49:35,760 --> 00:49:37,840
Are swords recyclable?

1152
00:49:37,840 --> 00:49:40,240
Is there something better I can do with it?

1153
00:49:40,240 --> 00:49:41,920
That's from Katana Katie.

1154
00:49:41,920 --> 00:49:42,420
Woof.

1155
00:49:43,280 --> 00:49:45,920
What kind of maintenance is one supposed to be doing

1156
00:49:45,920 --> 00:49:47,920
to the kill bill sword that their friend got them?

1157
00:49:47,920 --> 00:49:48,560
Cause I have-

1158
00:49:48,560 --> 00:49:49,280
Sword oil.

1159
00:49:49,840 --> 00:49:51,200
I have not been doing that.

1160
00:49:52,640 --> 00:49:54,640
That's one thing you learn about being an adult

1161
00:49:55,440 --> 00:49:57,600
is that almost everything that you take-

1162
00:49:57,600 --> 00:49:59,840
Like anytime you start Googling about how to,

1163
00:49:59,840 --> 00:50:04,560
almost every adult thing requires some sort of regular oil

1164
00:50:04,560 --> 00:50:06,320
and lubrication that nobody's doing.

1165
00:50:06,320 --> 00:50:06,880
That's young, yeah.

1166
00:50:08,560 --> 00:50:12,880
There's a really narrow window in your life

1167
00:50:13,840 --> 00:50:17,440
where being allowed to have a sword

1168
00:50:17,440 --> 00:50:21,280
and wanting to have a sword are happening at the same time.

1169
00:50:21,920 --> 00:50:25,920
Because when you're young, of course we all wanted swords.

1170
00:50:25,920 --> 00:50:26,640
I would ask-

1171
00:50:26,640 --> 00:50:28,320
We would go to anime conventions

1172
00:50:28,320 --> 00:50:31,600
by which I mean almost exclusively mid-Ohio con

1173
00:50:31,600 --> 00:50:33,200
every year with our dad and I would say,

1174
00:50:33,200 --> 00:50:36,720
father, father, will you buy me one of these big cool swords?

1175
00:50:36,720 --> 00:50:38,240
And most of the time the answer was no

1176
00:50:38,240 --> 00:50:41,440
until I was old enough to get a sword

1177
00:50:41,440 --> 00:50:44,480
and he got me a replica buster sword from Final Fantasy

1178
00:50:44,480 --> 00:50:47,360
which was unwieldy and difficult to use.

1179
00:50:47,360 --> 00:50:50,720
But then I did get high once and chop a watermelon with it

1180
00:50:50,720 --> 00:50:52,000
and forget to clean it.

1181
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:53,360
I forgot about that.

1182
00:50:53,360 --> 00:50:55,600
It got sticky and rusty and bad,

1183
00:50:55,600 --> 00:50:59,280
but then also I didn't want swords anymore.

1184
00:50:59,280 --> 00:51:01,680
So I threw that in the garbage can.

1185
00:51:01,680 --> 00:51:03,440
Like I threw it in a dumpster.

1186
00:51:03,440 --> 00:51:05,760
The answer is the only way to throw away a sword

1187
00:51:05,760 --> 00:51:08,400
is a dumpster illegally dumping a sword right in there.

1188
00:51:08,400 --> 00:51:10,960
I would worry that if that happened,

1189
00:51:10,960 --> 00:51:13,760
someone might find it and use it in a murder

1190
00:51:14,800 --> 00:51:17,120
and there's my prints all over it.

1191
00:51:17,120 --> 00:51:18,720
All over it and your watermelon.

1192
00:51:19,440 --> 00:51:20,960
I would say you would have to melt it

1193
00:51:20,960 --> 00:51:24,160
in some kind of ceremonial fire.

1194
00:51:24,160 --> 00:51:25,120
That's cool.

1195
00:51:25,120 --> 00:51:29,520
And then maybe forge a new sword for your children

1196
00:51:30,240 --> 00:51:36,160
so that they can carry on your wandering warrior ways.

1197
00:51:37,280 --> 00:51:39,040
I know people are probably wondering,

1198
00:51:39,040 --> 00:51:40,960
was it the coolest fucking thing you've ever seen

1199
00:51:40,960 --> 00:51:43,760
when you cut a watermelon all up with a buster sword?

1200
00:51:43,760 --> 00:51:46,000
And the answer is yes, it's unimaginable.

1201
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:48,240
We did it indoors in a kitchen.

1202
00:51:48,240 --> 00:51:50,000
It was so fucking rad

1203
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:51,920
and the best thing I'll ever do in my whole life.

1204
00:51:51,920 --> 00:51:54,800
And it's bad to have peaked at like 20.

1205
00:51:54,800 --> 00:51:56,000
Is it advisable, Griffin?

1206
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:57,920
Like if somebody right now is eyeballing

1207
00:51:57,920 --> 00:51:59,600
that watermelon they got from the store

1208
00:51:59,600 --> 00:52:02,080
and their buster sword replica.

1209
00:52:02,080 --> 00:52:04,160
Would you recommend that they do it?

1210
00:52:04,160 --> 00:52:07,360
This was my, I want to say sophomore year of college,

1211
00:52:07,360 --> 00:52:09,440
which means I was terribly high.

1212
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:13,440
There was no part of this that was good.

1213
00:52:13,440 --> 00:52:16,480
You hear me say I cut up a watermelon

1214
00:52:16,480 --> 00:52:19,040
in a big omnislash in our kitchen

1215
00:52:19,040 --> 00:52:21,680
with a replica, a very, very heavy buster sword.

1216
00:52:21,680 --> 00:52:23,280
And you think, well, that's only the kind of thing

1217
00:52:23,280 --> 00:52:24,720
that a very high person would do.

1218
00:52:24,720 --> 00:52:28,080
And then you think, uh-oh, but they shouldn't be.

1219
00:52:29,440 --> 00:52:31,760
How many people were around you, Griffin?

1220
00:52:31,760 --> 00:52:32,640
Everyone was around me.

1221
00:52:32,640 --> 00:52:34,720
I'm not, I knew it was a one-time thing.

1222
00:52:34,720 --> 00:52:36,560
Everyone was around you, okay.

1223
00:52:36,560 --> 00:52:38,000
Yeah, they were supporting me.

1224
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:40,160
They all had a hand on me as I did it,

1225
00:52:40,160 --> 00:52:42,080
channeling their energy into me.

1226
00:52:42,080 --> 00:52:43,920
Melted Down is a good one

1227
00:52:43,920 --> 00:52:46,720
and you can turn it into something like weak

1228
00:52:47,440 --> 00:52:50,400
and then you're fine with about the murder part of things.

1229
00:52:50,400 --> 00:52:50,960
That's fair.

1230
00:52:51,840 --> 00:52:53,120
Just hang it to Goodwill and be like,

1231
00:52:53,120 --> 00:52:54,080
y'all want a sword?

1232
00:52:54,080 --> 00:52:55,040
They probably will say yes.

1233
00:52:55,920 --> 00:52:56,640
Fuck yeah.

1234
00:52:56,640 --> 00:52:57,520
Yeah, we'll take it.

1235
00:52:57,520 --> 00:52:58,560
Take a sword.

1236
00:52:58,560 --> 00:52:59,680
Should have a garage sale

1237
00:53:01,200 --> 00:53:03,760
and it's just a folding table with one sword on it.

1238
00:53:03,760 --> 00:53:04,960
When someone goes to buy it, you're like,

1239
00:53:04,960 --> 00:53:07,680
oh, I can't just sell this to you.

1240
00:53:07,680 --> 00:53:09,200
You have to prove yourself.

1241
00:53:09,200 --> 00:53:10,000
That's so worthy.

1242
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:10,720
Let me get the owner.

1243
00:53:11,840 --> 00:53:13,360
And by the way, they're yelling this at you

1244
00:53:13,360 --> 00:53:14,400
from six feet away.

1245
00:53:14,400 --> 00:53:16,800
So you just sort of arranged this

1246
00:53:16,800 --> 00:53:18,480
so people could come and look at your sword?

1247
00:53:19,200 --> 00:53:20,480
Well, prove you're worthy.

1248
00:53:21,120 --> 00:53:22,400
I'm charging a mission, by the way.

1249
00:53:22,400 --> 00:53:24,800
You owe me $15.

1250
00:53:24,800 --> 00:53:26,640
No, the stuff for sale is in the garage,

1251
00:53:26,640 --> 00:53:28,160
but you got to get past me first.

1252
00:53:31,840 --> 00:53:32,640
Go get your sword.

1253
00:53:32,640 --> 00:53:34,000
Go home and get your sword.

1254
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:35,040
We'll cross blades.

1255
00:53:35,600 --> 00:53:36,160
Oh, shit.

1256
00:53:36,160 --> 00:53:38,000
Is yours a real Atori Hanzo?

1257
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:38,400
Fuck.

1258
00:53:38,400 --> 00:53:39,200
Yeah, it is.

1259
00:53:39,200 --> 00:53:40,960
I got some cool VHSs in there

1260
00:53:40,960 --> 00:53:43,200
that are going for a fucking song, man.

1261
00:53:43,200 --> 00:53:45,200
But you do have to duel me right here

1262
00:53:45,200 --> 00:53:48,640
from six feet away, which is going to be tough, man.

1263
00:53:48,640 --> 00:53:50,640
1v1 me, bro.

1264
00:53:50,640 --> 00:53:53,760
Go outside of your yard, get a big fake rock.

1265
00:53:53,760 --> 00:53:54,260
Okay.

1266
00:53:55,520 --> 00:53:58,720
Jam the sword down into the big fake rock.

1267
00:53:58,720 --> 00:54:01,760
Now, are you're just assuming that in my yard

1268
00:54:01,760 --> 00:54:03,120
there are big fake rocks?

1269
00:54:03,840 --> 00:54:04,720
Yeah, Travis.

1270
00:54:04,720 --> 00:54:06,400
Buy a big fake rock.

1271
00:54:06,400 --> 00:54:06,960
Oh, okay.

1272
00:54:06,960 --> 00:54:07,760
Why would there be?

1273
00:54:07,760 --> 00:54:09,200
If it's in your yard, it's a real rock.

1274
00:54:09,200 --> 00:54:10,640
Yes, that's what I was going to say.

1275
00:54:11,840 --> 00:54:12,800
A big fake rock.

1276
00:54:13,440 --> 00:54:15,520
You jam the sword into the big fake rock.

1277
00:54:15,520 --> 00:54:17,520
You wait for people to pass by.

1278
00:54:17,520 --> 00:54:19,760
They see a sword in a big fake rock

1279
00:54:19,760 --> 00:54:22,080
and they're like, fuck, of course.

1280
00:54:22,080 --> 00:54:23,600
Just human nature.

1281
00:54:24,480 --> 00:54:26,560
You have to try to see if you're the one.

1282
00:54:26,560 --> 00:54:27,060
Yeah.

1283
00:54:27,600 --> 00:54:30,720
So they go to remove the blade from the rock

1284
00:54:30,720 --> 00:54:32,000
and guess what they've discovered?

1285
00:54:32,800 --> 00:54:34,160
Uh, just a moment too late.

1286
00:54:35,120 --> 00:54:35,760
Oh, no.

1287
00:54:37,040 --> 00:54:38,640
Just the wrong moment.

1288
00:54:38,640 --> 00:54:39,920
One second too late.

1289
00:54:39,920 --> 00:54:42,720
You've fallen in my trap and you've touched the jelly

1290
00:54:42,720 --> 00:54:45,040
I put all over the sword handle.

1291
00:54:45,040 --> 00:54:46,160
Oh, my God.

1292
00:54:46,160 --> 00:54:47,280
Oh, shit.

1293
00:54:47,280 --> 00:54:50,240
Now you're like, what do you have on your hands?

1294
00:54:50,240 --> 00:54:51,120
Uh, excuse me.

1295
00:54:51,120 --> 00:54:51,920
I'm going to sue you.

1296
00:54:51,920 --> 00:54:52,960
I have jelly all over my hands.

1297
00:54:52,960 --> 00:54:54,320
Why do you have all the jelly on your hands?

1298
00:54:54,320 --> 00:54:56,720
Is it trying to take the sword out of the stone?

1299
00:54:56,720 --> 00:54:58,160
Well, that's fucking idiotic.

1300
00:54:59,360 --> 00:55:00,080
You're the idiot.

1301
00:55:01,040 --> 00:55:02,160
You got jelly on your hands.

1302
00:55:02,160 --> 00:55:02,800
You wear that.

1303
00:55:02,800 --> 00:55:03,280
You own it.

1304
00:55:03,280 --> 00:55:04,480
That's my sword.

1305
00:55:04,480 --> 00:55:05,360
It's in my yard.

1306
00:55:05,920 --> 00:55:06,960
It's my sword.

1307
00:55:06,960 --> 00:55:10,000
You don't have the right to take a sword that's mine on my property.

1308
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:12,480
Would you just walk up and try to take my bird bath

1309
00:55:12,480 --> 00:55:13,920
to see if you're the one?

1310
00:55:13,920 --> 00:55:14,420
No.

1311
00:55:14,420 --> 00:55:17,060
I bought this house to try to give myself time

1312
00:55:17,060 --> 00:55:19,540
to get strong enough to pull the sword out of the stone.

1313
00:55:19,540 --> 00:55:21,780
And you think you're just going to walk up here and take it?

1314
00:55:21,780 --> 00:55:22,980
That's why you have a jelly.

1315
00:55:22,980 --> 00:55:25,940
That's why there's little bees all over you right now.

1316
00:55:25,940 --> 00:55:27,540
They're swimming around your hands,

1317
00:55:27,540 --> 00:55:28,580
waiting for the moment of strike.

1318
00:55:28,580 --> 00:55:31,060
Now do you want that sword?

1319
00:55:31,060 --> 00:55:32,820
Because I will sell it to you.

1320
00:55:33,380 --> 00:55:35,460
Now you've bought it and your prints are all over it.

1321
00:55:35,460 --> 00:55:36,500
No, you know what?

1322
00:55:36,500 --> 00:55:37,300
I'll say this.

1323
00:55:37,300 --> 00:55:38,180
Go ahead and try again.

1324
00:55:38,180 --> 00:55:39,540
And if you can pull it out, you're right.

1325
00:55:39,540 --> 00:55:40,820
You got jellied again.

1326
00:55:40,820 --> 00:55:41,140
Why?

1327
00:55:41,140 --> 00:55:42,100
You fell for it.

1328
00:55:42,100 --> 00:55:44,100
You knew there was jelly on there.

1329
00:55:44,100 --> 00:55:45,460
You knew there was jelly.

1330
00:55:45,460 --> 00:55:47,460
Thank you so much for listening to our podcast.

1331
00:55:47,460 --> 00:55:48,420
My brother, my brother, and me,

1332
00:55:48,420 --> 00:55:51,060
we hope you have enjoyed yourself here.

1333
00:55:51,060 --> 00:55:52,900
We've certainly had fun chatting with you.

1334
00:55:54,100 --> 00:55:56,340
If you are so inclined,

1335
00:55:57,220 --> 00:56:00,900
you can head on over to McElroyMerch.com.

1336
00:56:00,900 --> 00:56:04,180
We've got a t-shirt with our new art on it,

1337
00:56:04,180 --> 00:56:07,380
t-shirt with our old art on it to protest our new art.

1338
00:56:07,380 --> 00:56:09,700
We have some fun summer magnets.

1339
00:56:10,420 --> 00:56:12,260
And there's still,

1340
00:56:12,260 --> 00:56:15,620
let me just check a few left

1341
00:56:15,620 --> 00:56:18,180
of our 10th anniversary commemorative plate.

1342
00:56:18,740 --> 00:56:19,940
So you do want to get,

1343
00:56:21,860 --> 00:56:22,740
I can't even.

1344
00:56:22,740 --> 00:56:23,460
It's tough to even.

1345
00:56:23,460 --> 00:56:24,180
It is there.

1346
00:56:24,180 --> 00:56:25,460
I'll just say it's there.

1347
00:56:25,460 --> 00:56:26,820
I'll just say it's there.

1348
00:56:26,820 --> 00:56:28,340
I also want to say,

1349
00:56:28,340 --> 00:56:28,900
if you go to,

1350
00:56:29,620 --> 00:56:31,460
this is just a little secret between friends,

1351
00:56:31,460 --> 00:56:32,340
between you and me.

1352
00:56:32,340 --> 00:56:34,740

It is, and I'm not just saying this,

1356
00:56:40,180 --> 00:56:41,140
our best one yet.

1357
00:56:41,140 --> 00:56:43,140

for the use of our theme song,

1365
00:56:52,980 --> 00:56:53,700
It's a Departure,

1366
00:56:53,700 --> 00:56:54,180
off the album,

1367
00:56:54,180 --> 00:56:55,220
Putting the Days to Bed.

1368
00:56:55,780 --> 00:56:56,660
Great tunes, man.

1369
00:56:57,620 --> 00:57:00,900
Crank them up over the cooler

1370
00:57:01,460 --> 00:57:03,060
that you have by yourself

1371
00:57:05,060 --> 00:57:06,740
outside at a safe place.

1372
00:57:06,740 --> 00:57:07,780
And thanks to Maximum Fun

1373
00:57:07,780 --> 00:57:08,660

a new narrative podcast,

1378
00:57:15,300 --> 00:57:17,700
a short engagement,

1379
00:57:17,700 --> 00:57:18,660
limited engagement.

1380
00:57:19,620 --> 00:57:21,380
That's really, really slick.

1381
00:57:21,380 --> 00:57:23,700
And yeah, y'all want that final?

1382
00:57:24,580 --> 00:57:25,780
Yes, please.

1383
00:57:25,780 --> 00:57:27,060
It was sent in by Nicole.

1384
00:57:27,060 --> 00:57:28,100
Thank you, Nicole.

1385
00:57:28,100 --> 00:57:30,820
It's from Yahoo Answers user, Crabby, who asks,

1386
00:57:30,820 --> 00:57:38,020
What is the next big ring pop flavor?

1387
00:57:38,020 --> 00:57:39,460
My name is Justin McElroy.

1388
00:57:39,460 --> 00:57:40,500
I'm Travis McElroy.

1389
00:57:40,500 --> 00:57:42,020
I'm Griffin McElroy.

1390
00:57:42,020 --> 00:57:43,460
This has been my brother, me.

1391
00:57:43,460 --> 00:57:44,420
Kiss your dad.

1392
00:57:44,420 --> 00:58:01,380
This has been my brother, me, kiss your dad, square on the lips.
