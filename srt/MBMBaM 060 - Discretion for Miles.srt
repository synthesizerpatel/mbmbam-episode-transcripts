1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:30,800
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:50,880
Father's Day, Anthony Weiner. We tried to come up with a way to combine those two openings

6
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:57,840
for 30 minutes. Solid. Nothing. He's a daddy, right? Instead, we'll just say Anthony Weiner,

7
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:03,600
Father's Day. My brother, my brother, and me. Sorry to begin in such an upsetting fact.

8
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:13,520
Topical, cutting edge, Weiner, Weiner, Weiner. Lots of comedians are making Weiner puns,

9
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:17,200
but nobody's really embracing just saying Weiner Day.

10
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:22,560
I've fallen behind on the news. What's this guy's story? What's his sitch?

11
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:29,360
His story is he is a lawmaker with a really great sense of irony.

12
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:34,320
Yeah, and a really great iron, a really great nine iron down there in his zone, he means,

13
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:37,440
I mean, in his pants. In his Caddyshack?

14
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:39,280
It is down in his Caddyshack.

15
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:45,200
Representative Weiner represented his Weiner to a lady on Twitter.

16
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:53,680
But it doesn't matter because the comedic ground has already been thoroughly sort of tilled.

17
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:59,440
What I'm saying is nobody's pushed it the extra level of blending with Father's Day.

18
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:00,000
I see.

19
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,320
Right, right. I think it's going to give it that special picante spice that we regularly

20
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:06,160
provide with our topical mashups.

21
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:07,520
Is that cilantro? No.

22
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:13,120
So hold up, hold up. This cat, he tweeted a dick pic?

23
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:15,200
I can't, like, keep you...

24
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:21,040
No, no, no, hold on. This is a chance for real world wisdom.

25
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:25,600
Like, unless you've got a sound effect somewhere of like a hyperbaric chamber opening and you're

26
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:26,400
stepping out of it.

27
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:32,880
No, seriously. So he didn't text it. He tweet blasted his dick to a woman?

28
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:33,680
Yes.

29
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:35,200
How do you goof that hard?

30
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:41,760
You forget that D to signify a direct message and says just like, hey, Lloyd, look what I did.

31
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:43,520
Check out this dick and these balls.

32
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:45,200
Look what God did, Lori.

33
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:47,920
Oh, God, that's rough. That's rough stuff.

34
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:52,080
That's rough, but it's been rough for like two weeks. Like, what are you? What have you been?

35
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:57,040
Like, it's been like the biggest because Wiener is his name. Like, his name is Wiener and like...

36
00:02:57,040 --> 00:03:02,080
Justin, I had to go on a spiritual spirit quest journey.

37
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:05,440
Unless your ass is in a sweat lodge. I have no excuses.

38
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:11,600
In the week before and after, I went to a coffee enema lodge to prepare for the live

39
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:12,400
show that we did.

40
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:14,400
Isn't that right across from King's Island?

41
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:21,040
It is. You turn left to King's Island. It's actually on top of the fake Eiffel Tower in

42
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:24,800
King's Island. You get up there and you just for two weeks, just like find your spirit

43
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:27,040
animal and get coffee enemas back to back.

44
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:29,840
That's how it sounds beautiful. This is, as you certainly guessed,

45
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:33,600
my brother and my brother and me, an advice show for the modern era. I'm your oldest brother,

46
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:34,880
Justin McElroy.

47
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:37,280
And I'm your middle-est brother, Travis McElroy.

48
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:42,240
And I'm the baby Griffin. How do you tweet a picture of your dick at somebody?

49
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:46,080
And then as an elected official, how do you do that and then not go,

50
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:48,160
Oh, damn shit.

51
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:51,360
Well, that's the coolest thing about this story. I cannot believe you've drugged me

52
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:57,280
into talking about this. The best thing about this story is that when everybody was like,

53
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:01,280
Hey, you tweeted a picture of your dick. He was like, hackers.

54
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:10,240
Fucking lulz, lulz set kicked in my door, pulled down my pants and snapped a JPEG on

55
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:10,960
my sweet dick.

56
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:15,440
It's literally like, I could not kick that dick out of a lineup.

57
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:18,080
Shaggy was directly behind him like, say it wasn't you.

58
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:24,160
You got me, Shaggy. Are you sure, Shaggy? Say it wasn't you.

59
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:28,880
And that'll work. Just tell him it wasn't. Say it wasn't. All right.

60
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:29,840
You get it, Shag.

61
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:34,640
Um, picture this. I tweeted a picture of my dick.

62
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:35,140
Shaggy!

63
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:40,080
So this is our advice show. Let's get to the advice.

64
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:45,920
This girl I've been dating for two and a half months now. We have S-E-X on a regular basis.

65
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:52,320
I come over to her apartment often and we even go on dates every week.

66
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:55,040
Despite all this, she doesn't want to be called my girlfriend.

67
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:59,440
And when I asked her what it is that we're doing, she says, hanging out.

68
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:05,280
When I ask her what she tells her family about me, she says, I'm the guy.

69
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:10,080
What do I do, brothers? Sincerely, Lost in Translation.

70
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:15,360
Just first and foremost, I think being called the guy is way cooler than being the boyfriend.

71
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:17,120
Yeah, it's pretty fucking cool.

72
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:21,840
Like, oh, this is my roofing. This is my roofing guy. This is my fucking guy.

73
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:24,240
This is my guy for doing it.

74
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:30,000
Um, yeah, like that that sounds like like calling somebody the guy is like something

75
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,600
you reserve for super like that's something you'd call Timothy Olyphant or something.

76
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:36,720
Like super cool people.

77
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:37,220
Uh huh.

78
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:41,520
Um, you don't get much cooler than Timothy Olyphant.

79
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:48,800
Timmy O, um, I, I think that you're, you are a little too hung up on nomenclature and she's

80
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:52,400
way too hung up on avoiding nomenclature, like to a weird extent.

81
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:56,640
Like, you know, but I, I know those people. I know those people that say like putting

82
00:05:56,640 --> 00:06:02,080
a name on it ruins it, but they're still doing that. They're still dating. They're still doing

83
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:05,920
the shit, but they're just not calling it that cause they're afraid of spoiling it or ruining

84
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:11,600
it or something. And that's dumb. But at the same time, it's straightforward dumb. It's like,

85
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:13,840
Hey, here's the deal. We're not going to call it boyfriend, girlfriend.

86
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:19,040
Listen, a rose, a rose by any other name is still getting a stick wet on the rag.

87
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:24,080
What's up? Yeah. You, you, I mean, if, if you're uncomfortable now, okay,

88
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:29,280
maybe it's not the labels. Maybe it's the lack of stability. I would say that he's unsure.

89
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:32,800
Like it's, you know, he doesn't know what they're doing, right? He doesn't know.

90
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:38,240
It's not just that she is, you know what I think that I think that that happens in every

91
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:42,720
relationship and it's not just with the title. I think that yeah, the title is this security

92
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:46,880
blanket that makes you feel better. But I think everybody always goes through that entrance period,

93
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:51,520
especially two and a half months in, geez. I just like, what is this? What's going on?

94
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:58,720
Are we committed? I don't know. Am I the guy? Yeah. I can't carry the guy.

95
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:04,400
I can't think of a, like a relationship status that is more secure than hanging out

96
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:12,160
because you can't, you'll never stop hanging out. Like you can take that shit to the grave.

97
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:20,480
Like, Oh, do you, Lori promise to take Jacob and just like fucking bro out within 24.

98
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:26,800
Sev, I, uh, speaking of labels, I have hung out many a time. You are not hanging out. No.

99
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:33,840
I mean, in between, in between playing Sega and eating juice pops. Yeah. Hey, you want to pop in

100
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:38,880
an inch on 96 little fuck, whatever, whatever you want to do. Just come over and hang out.

101
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:45,600
We'll make some bagel bites. See where it goes. Just grow out with some NES. Um, I, I think that

102
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:53,120
if it, you can ask her to label things all you want. She's obviously not ready for anything

103
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:57,600
super serious. So I, I, if you're expecting that or wanting that, I don't think you're going to

104
00:07:57,600 --> 00:08:03,360
get it from this girl. Nope. At least not right now. Not directly, but I mean, well, it depends on

105
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:10,480
when you could turn it into a relationship without labeling it, without making it a big deal,

106
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:14,800
it can become a relationship. But if it's important to you that you know what it is upfront,

107
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:22,640
you're not going to get that. Let's ask her, am I a guy or the guy? As long as you're the guy are

108
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:30,800
cool. Unless he's like got the man. Unless you're the guy, number 26, the dude, the fella, the

109
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:39,120
gentleman suitor. This is my caller. He's taking me to cotillion. He brought me a glassy unicorn.

110
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:50,800
Way too much. Twin Peaks. Yeah. I have what? No. What? I'm going to come through this fucking

111
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:58,960
microphone. Clarence Menagerie you dumb bitch. There's also in Twin Peaks a scene where the

112
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:03,520
guy gives the other girl it's the glass unicorn. God, you're right. All right. Damn it. I'll let

113
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:15,200
it slide this time. Deez Nuts. Agent Dale Cooper up in this bitch. All right. I have an etiquette

114
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:19,840
question for you. Oh, you've come to the right place clearly. Often when a friend or family

115
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:22,720
member is going through a difficult time, a person will say something along the lines of,

116
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:30,080
I'll be praying for you. You'll be in my prayers. This thing is I'm not a particularly religious

117
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:34,160
person, so telling someone I'm going to pray for them feels a little fraudulent. Obviously,

118
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:39,600
if someone is about to go into surgery or something, it's not a good time to say good luck

119
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:45,760
with all that or that death is probabilistic and ultimately inevitable. So can you guys help me

120
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:51,360
come up with some other non-religious phrases that carry the same weight and meaning as

121
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:59,440
Deez more traditional sentiments? Thanks for the help, Chris. Wow. Wow. Well, don't definitely

122
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:04,880
don't say that shit about death being inevitable. I think that there is I think that there's such

123
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:10,480
a wide spectrum between I'll be praying for you and good luck with all that. Yeah. You know what?

124
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:15,200
I know there's some shit in between those two, right, dawg? I tell people they've been on my

125
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:19,680
heart. Yeah, it seems that cuts that cuts to, hey, you've been on my heart lately. You've you've been

126
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:25,200
you've been in my thoughts. Yeah, there it is. Been in my heart. My thoughts. My whole thing

127
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:30,000
has been about you. You could also say I'll be playing for you if you're a professional athlete

128
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:35,920
because then it's like, oh, they're dedicating or a musician or if you have a like a particularly

129
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:41,040
intense like bocce ball match coming up. Yeah, this one's for you, Greg. That's what I'm going

130
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:48,000
to do with this bowl. I don't know. I think you can also say, like, you know, I'm here. I'm here.

131
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:51,520
If you need anything, let me know if you need anything and I can help you with that. Like,

132
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:56,960
I think that I think that saying that you'll be in my thoughts, it's not practical. What's

133
00:10:56,960 --> 00:11:02,480
bad about like if something happens, I'll marry your wife. No, no, no. Like, do you do you want

134
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:08,320
any? I'm about to run a Taco Bell. Do you want a fajita and maybe a medium Baja blast? There's

135
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:13,120
maybe some cinnamon twists. You want to get surgery? Dangerous, dangerous surgery. But do

136
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:17,760
you want a chalupa first? What a surprise. That'll be for the doctor. What's this? What's this in

137
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:25,120
side him? Hey, is this a Baja fish taco that you ate before surgery? You were given explicit

138
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:31,440
instructions not to eat and specific instructions not to eat Baja fish tacos ever. Why would you

139
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:37,440
put two in here? Are these your car keys? What did you even do? Wait a second. Wait a second.

140
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:49,760
The tumor is gone. Fish taco killed your tumor. This is Baja sauce is a cure. Eureka. Eureka.

141
00:11:51,520 --> 00:12:00,640
Thank you, you fat fuck. You did it. So what what other? How about if something happens,

142
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:04,960
I'll delete your internet history. It's good. I feel like that's practical. I'd appreciate it.

143
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:15,120
Yeah. Um, how about you are definitely going to make it through this. Guarantee them. I swear

144
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:20,000
on every by the moon and the stars in the sky. Oh, the best part about that is if something happens,

145
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:24,080
how are you going to be held accountable? That's true. That's true. They got, well,

146
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:29,120
you got hauntings. Yeah. OBS, obviously. Oh, you're going to have a ghost writer situation

147
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:33,200
on your hands. Yeah. He's going to haunt your words, your phrases, read everything you're

148
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:38,560
writing. Going to make your words better. Talk about your grammar. Yeah. Or your grandma. Hey,

149
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:43,280
Griffin, you know, do you want to Yahoo? Yeah. I haven't looked at these for a while. I should

150
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:49,760
probably really having to suck at this thermos to get the coffee inside. So if you hear like a

151
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:55,120
sort of like a, a wet wind tunnel, like a squishy wind tunnel, that's me getting some hazelnut.

152
00:12:56,640 --> 00:13:02,800
This one was the daily dosage of vitamin H. This one was sent by two people, hazelnut,

153
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:08,080
which is weird. Came from two different people with the same question. The internet's such a

154
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:14,880
big place. Yeah. It was sent by Thomas Anderson and Jonathan Cole. Thank you, dudes. It's by

155
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:22,880
Yahoo Answers user Lucretia Millicent, who asks, my 14 year old sister is afraid of Hitler. I

156
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:29,200
thought she was crazy, but now I'm starting to wonder. My little sister is so scared to death

157
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:34,320
of Hitler. She can't even go outside. It started when she had this dream about Hitler coming up

158
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:38,800
through the plumbing and getting in the house. So she makes us keep cement blocks on all the

159
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:44,720
toilet lids and also on the washer. And she will only take baths, no showers so she can plug the

160
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:49,200
hole. She says Hitler can come out of the sewer though. And that's why she refuses to leave the

161
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:55,680
house. Now I was really worried and wanted to help her get over it. So I made up a spell to banish

162
00:13:55,680 --> 00:14:00,800
Hitler, thinking that maybe that would make her feel safe. Well, we were doing the spell in the

163
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:06,320
bathroom and the toilet seat lifted. And I heard some man speaking German. We screamed and got up

164
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:10,720
and ran off. And now my sister's putting chains on the toilet. So I hope no one gets the shits

165
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:17,360
anytime soon. What happened? That's what I'm wondering. That's my favorite part of this

166
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:24,000
question. Can't quite put it together. So Hitler. Okay. If you believe in Hitler hard enough, he

167
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:29,280
will appear. That's that's an inevitability. We've actually said his name too many times now.

168
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:34,880
Cause if you say it to me enough times, he just, he apparates like Betelgeuse, very much like

169
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:42,320
Betelgeuse only instead of a mischief, he, he, he does unspeakable genocide crimes. Well, I think

170
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:47,680
that, um, I remember from spectrum, right? It's like the worst, the worst kind of, it's like the

171
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:55,200
most mischief you could do ever. Like the highest level of shenanigans ever to the point. I can't,

172
00:14:55,200 --> 00:15:03,440
I don't think we can call it hijinks. Like it's like a nightmarish crime against humanity indicates

173
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:09,680
like a wink and a nod. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Hijinks usually is harmless. It's like a fiasco. I would

174
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:15,200
not, I would not call the planking is hijinks. Yes. Thank you. Have you guys ever heard that

175
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:22,160
urban legend, um, where parents buy their kids, um, baby hitlers and then as they start to get

176
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:27,600
too big, the parents flush the baby hitlers down the toilet and then you have to worry about the

177
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:32,880
deal grown hitlers down in the sewer. Right. And it forms if, if, if they get to, um, in like a

178
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:38,080
metropolitan area, this is true. I swear to Christ, uh, in, in metropolitan areas where the population,

179
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:44,160
uh, per mile is, is, you know, so dense that the, uh, the hitlers, the flushed hitlers will grow

180
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:48,720
together and form a Hitler king. That's absolutely true. That is a hundred percent. Absolutely true.

181
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:53,120
That is a hundred percent true. The only thing that you can hope is that Winston Churchill

182
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:57,920
has also been flushed and has been baked in some sort of mutagenic ooze. And then they have the

183
00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:06,880
most epic battle, the most epic battle. Um, somebody like, can we go ahead and option these rights?

184
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:14,640
TM by the way. TM all that shit. C with a circle around it. Ninja Winston's teenager.

185
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:19,120
I'm Winston. I'm also Winston.

186
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:25,840
I use the bo staff. I use the bo staff, but I am Winston.

187
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:32,400
Do you know what, uh, Hitler and also Hitler King's biggest weaknesses?

188
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:35,280
Lemon juice. Magic spells.

189
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:40,000
Magic spells, obviously. That's why he got so fucking aggro and tried to come out of your

190
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:44,480
toilet pipes is because you, you pissed him off with your magic spells. Most people don't know

191
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:51,440
this. Um, Hitler hauntings, you can, you can comfortably live in, in a place, in an apartment

192
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:56,320
or home, uh, any sort of domestic setting that is being haunted by a Hitler ghost.

193
00:16:57,120 --> 00:17:00,640
Usually, usually you can make it work for you and see if the land will, will, you know,

194
00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:07,280
knock off a hundo from that wreck. Hey, I'm pretty sure it smells like mustache wax in here. I pretty

195
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:15,520
much all the time. Yeah. What can I do? What can you do? Um, also what happened? People say, what

196
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:21,360
happened to Hitler? You mean, or the mustache? This whole situation. I'm so confused. What

197
00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:27,200
happened with their spell? Like, I don't know. Was a Ouija board involved? Was there a Ouija?

198
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:31,760
Cause I read a book, a tract, actually a Chick tract about Ouija boards and they're, they are

199
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:35,920
evil. I know that much. Yeah, definitely. When you were talking about the part where like, she's

200
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:41,520
afraid to go outside. I had this mental image of like the girl looking out the window and Hitler

201
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:45,200
leaning out from behind a tree and just like pointing at the girl and the girl was ducking

202
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:49,520
back down. Now I'm scared of Hitler. Thanks so much. That's a horror time. Can't leave the

203
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:55,600
house now. My longtime boyfriend followed me when I moved out of state and it did not go well.

204
00:17:55,600 --> 00:18:00,640
We broke up and he moved back to our hometown. However, he left most of his personal belongings

205
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:06,000
behind. Keep saying he's going to get them, but it's been almost a year since he moved out. Now

206
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:12,560
my lease is up at the end of summer and I want to move to a new apartment. Is it okay for me to

207
00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:17,840
throw his stuff away? That was from Carrie Anne. Yes, of course it is. Of course it is. How's this

208
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:24,160
a question? Hey, throw everything away. I'm, I'm moving to, um, to Austin in a little under a month

209
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:30,000
now and I'm going to throw, watch out ladies. Hey babies. I'm going to throw every fucking thing

210
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:35,600
that I own away that I don't use on a day to day. If there were other people that you took with you.

211
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:41,600
Oh man, it's gone man. It's fucking gone. If you have shit in my employee that I have not touched

212
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:47,520
nor seen in, in 12 months, it's gone. It's gone. So I think Carrie, an important thing to keep in

213
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:53,360
mind here is when he left that shit there, here's basically saying to you, Hey, make sure you move

214
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:58,080
this with you when you go anywhere. And that's bullshit. It doesn't come to get it in a year or

215
00:18:58,080 --> 00:19:02,400
asked you to ship it to them or pay for shipping or something. It's yours. You need to sell it in

216
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:09,200
a garage sale or give it away or burn it. Nobody wants things anymore. I think that since I turned,

217
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:15,920
uh, call it 18, the, my main action has been getting rid of stuff, like trying to unload stuff

218
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:21,360
and my getting rid of material possessions in this world, you accumulate them so quickly. I just want

219
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:27,360
to get rid of them. I just hate shit. I want to get rid of shit. Yeah. I hate having things and I,

220
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:32,160
I try to get rid of them. I try to pawn them off on, uh, people that come into my office.

221
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:39,360
I'll hand them several books or maybe, uh, uh, old fifth grade drawings, some masking tape.

222
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:45,280
That's almost all gone. I don't want to keep the roll around. Like he just pawned all that off on

223
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:50,320
you. I think you probably want to shoot him a text. Just like, Hey, your stuff's going in the

224
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:56,800
garbage. Sorry, Dylan. Come get it. Come get it. If you want it to the garbage dumpster,

225
00:19:56,800 --> 00:20:00,960
probably bullshit stuff anyways. I mean, if he didn't take it with him, he can't be that committed.

226
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:05,360
Yeah. It's not like his fucking asthma inhalers that he needs to live. Like it's his fucking

227
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:12,560
rollout desk. Like it's, it's probably got all got bed bugs in it. Yeah. You know what else is

228
00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:20,720
in that stuff? Memories. Gotta get rid of it, girl. It's all, he left you with a bunch of bed bug

229
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:25,840
stuff, a bunch of BB gear and you're supposed to keep it? Nah, it's going to the dumpster.

230
00:20:27,040 --> 00:20:33,600
Sorry, BB gear. Sorry, Dylan. Your things are in the trash. I set them on fire. Also, I miss you.

231
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:38,480
Come back. Dylan, I miss you so much. Please come back. How can I become cooler on Facebook?

232
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:42,800
I try to post interesting status updates, upload wacky photos of my friends and I,

233
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:46,320
and I often wish other people happy birthday, even if I don't know them that well. But no one

234
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:50,000
ever gives me any Facebook attention. I want to be cool in the internet world,

235
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:55,120
as well as the regular world. Help me, brothers. What should I do? Pitiful in Pittsburgh.

236
00:20:55,680 --> 00:21:01,520
That's no way to start. Yeah. Don't be pitiful. Trying to buck up. Trying to turn this around.

237
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:09,200
Do less? Yeah, that's it. No, you got to make them want it. Yeah. You think? How can they miss you

238
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:15,680
if you're always there? It's like this. If you, if you accept every friend request and say yes to

239
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:19,760
everybody who asks you to do something, then it's not special. But if you request like, if you

240
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:25,280
accept like one out of every thousand, then that one person feels so fucking special to be your

241
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:29,920
friend. How would they ever know though? How could you ever know? I'll tell them. I'll tell you what

242
00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:34,800
discourages me from, from interacting with people on Facebook. You got to get a good picture of

243
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:40,880
yourself. Don't put a weird picture of you standing in shadows that looks like you're on fire. Oh,

244
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:46,320
you smell bad and there's PU lines going off. Get like, get your sexy right. Get a really nice

245
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:52,080
looking picture. You know what I mean? Who are these people that have photoshopped stink flies

246
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:57,520
and PU lines coming off their body? Somebody who would call themselves pitiful in Pittsburgh.

247
00:21:57,520 --> 00:22:03,840
Fair enough. Make sure that you don't have a Facebook photo of like an animal or like you

248
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:10,080
in a big group. Oh, I hate that. Are you and a baby and the babies in the picture? That's not

249
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:13,200
a baby. When it's not your baby because it confuses all of your friends from high school.

250
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:16,640
They're all going, oh, is that your baby? And you're like, no. It's like, well,

251
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:21,280
bullshit. Thanks for putting the baby on the grid, asshole. My latest point of contention

252
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:25,760
is for Father's Day, a lot of people have been changing their Facebook profile pictures to that

253
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:30,640
of their dads of their daddies. And it's like, that's pretty confusing for me when it's like,

254
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:35,680
oh, Jennifer kind of looks like a dad now. Like why am I friends with all these old dads? Why?

255
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:40,960
Why are all these dads? My friend, my ex girlfriend is a dad. What things? I got,

256
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:48,720
I got off that train just in time. Apparently for the swap, the switcheroo. Um, also I would suggest

257
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:53,600
not wishing happy birthday to people. You don't know that well. I wouldn't want people. I don't

258
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:57,120
know that well. The wish me happy birthday kind of creeps me out that they know that much about me.

259
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:03,360
I don't know about that. I like, I mean, we've talked about my, um, my policy on Facebook and

260
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:09,120
how it's basically just a bed of human beings that I just roll around and get dirty. Okay.

261
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:16,240
Their thoughts just like, Hey, weirdo don't know you. Here's a poke. Is it possible that you,

262
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:22,560
uh, that you posted a lot of bullshit? Cause sometimes when people post a lot of bullshit,

263
00:23:22,560 --> 00:23:28,000
I just give me old blocker Reno. I send them straight to the block pile and it could be

264
00:23:28,560 --> 00:23:37,040
that you've gotten the old, the old block. I don't have a better name for it, but like,

265
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:42,000
it could be that you just got blocked and like nobody can see your shit because forever you

266
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:46,560
talked about how depressed you were and no one wants to see that. That's the first thing. If

267
00:23:46,560 --> 00:23:50,080
you're doing that, which if your name is pitiful and Pittsburgh, I'm assuming you've done at least

268
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:56,240
once. Like fuck that noise. Like you got to who people want to be friends with happy people.

269
00:23:57,280 --> 00:24:01,360
Like I like to hang out with happy people. Those are the people I want to associate with.

270
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:08,560
So just fake it. Put on a big plastic smile. Have you thought about, um, Facebooking pictures of

271
00:24:08,560 --> 00:24:14,080
your, of your, of your PP, of your cleaner, of your weakness of your weakness? Have you

272
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:18,720
thought about Facebooking like wildfire and then with a caption that says, wish you were here

273
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:24,880
or in my wiener. What I'm going to just tag your tag, your whole wiener. I guess that's what people

274
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:32,320
do with photos and see if anybody like likes it. Do you like this wiener? Like 65 people like this

275
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:40,240
wiener. Click here to see who these nasty fucks are. That'll get you. You, you got to start mixing

276
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:46,480
it up. You got to take it out there and just really get crazy. Get crazy on the live on the

277
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:53,120
edge. Change your face, change your relationship status to dead to dead. I'll get some attention.

278
00:24:53,120 --> 00:25:00,000
No, don't do that. Cause then you, you would be killed. Um, I think that first off you need

279
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:04,480
to private message everybody and say, I'm sorry that I was so depressing for so long, but I'm

280
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:10,240
really turning it around. Come back to the new, the new and improved pitiful and Pittsburgh

281
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:16,960
Facebook experience. Now with a hundred percent more dick pics, check them, tag them, like them.

282
00:25:17,680 --> 00:25:20,880
Change your real name to dick pic Danny. Even if your name's not Danny.

290
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:13,280
this one was sent in by Ousmane Mariko. I'm a Bim Bam superfan. Thank you Ousmane. We're

291
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:17,760
getting there closer. It's by yahoo answers user Rebecca Rose who asks,

292
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:24,640
what would you consider to be personality traits of an ideal stallion?

293
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:31,760
Hmm. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Go on. No, I won't go on. Cause that's all that this question is.

294
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:37,680
Like literal stallion. Yeah. Like a, like a, like a horse, like a proud.

295
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:43,520
Well, I think we can all agree unbroken spirit. Unbroken spirit. Unbroken legs also is important.

296
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:46,880
Less of a personality. I think discreet.

297
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:52,240
Able to keep a secret. What is the application of that?

298
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:55,600
What, what, what, why do we need to discreet? Well, Griffin, if I knew the application,

299
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:59,440
I wouldn't, I wouldn't tell you. I mean, I'm trying to be like a stallion here.

300
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:03,200
It defeats the point of discretion if you just go and your wiener pics everywhere.

301
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:11,600
Hey horse, why did you tweet this picture of my wiener? Hey horse, I didn't give you my phone.

302
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:15,600
That was between us. That was between us, horse.

303
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:22,400
I came to you in confidence. What kind of smartphone could a horse possibly operate?

304
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:26,960
This question is ridiculous. So there's another good personality trait. Dexterity.

305
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:34,160
Dexterity. Like yeah. Manual dexterity. Um, tail. A smooth tail. A proud tail.

306
00:27:35,280 --> 00:27:41,040
That's important in races. Um. And also not a racist. I don't like a horse.

307
00:27:41,040 --> 00:27:46,320
I, I want them to love all horses and humans equally. Open-minded. Yeah. It's okay if they're

308
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:50,400
biasing against fat people because that's like a health issue. Yeah. Yeah, they'll snap right in

309
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:57,680
half. Um, I think, I think you gotta, it's gotta have some wisdom in its eyes. That's good. I think

310
00:27:57,680 --> 00:28:03,280
when you look deep in that horse's eyes, you've gotta know that there's, there's, there's feelings

311
00:28:03,280 --> 00:28:08,160
stirring around in there, you know? And no bugs. No bugs. I hate it when a horse has bugs in there

312
00:28:08,160 --> 00:28:13,840
and it won't even use its comically long tongue to lick them off or sweep the way with its mane,

313
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:20,160
with a flourish of its proud long head. Um, have you mentioned? I just love horses so much.

314
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:27,600
I love horses too. I love their thick trunks. And I think that I need a proud horse. I think I need

315
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:33,920
a proud, um, gelding. I want to, I want a horse that's going to be more like a best friend. Yeah.

316
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:40,320
Yeah. Yeah. Right. And maybe we go on adventures together and like my cowboy hat falls off and he

317
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:44,560
picks it up for me and nudges me forward and drives me on. That's so great. I just want,

318
00:28:44,560 --> 00:28:49,760
I want a horse I can hang out with in every possible definition of the term. Yeah. Just

319
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:53,920
a horse who's fucking cool. I just want, not uppity like some of those other horses. I just

320
00:28:53,920 --> 00:28:59,360
want to hang out. I want a horse that if I joke like maybe today you can ride me,

321
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:05,680
me, he'll, he'll laugh, but he won't take the joke too far. Yeah. Very painful. They're very heavy.

322
00:29:05,680 --> 00:29:11,200
I've, I've written a lot of Pintos that will just like take the goof and run with it. And it's like,

323
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:16,000
now it's weird Pinto and I have to put you down. Now I have to destroy you. Cause I know you're

324
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:21,040
not discreet. I was trying to forgive that. But now I want a horse that knows that when I have to

325
00:29:21,040 --> 00:29:27,520
destroy him, I have to do it. Sure. Like he's, he's, he feels bad for you because of the position

326
00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:32,240
that he is putting you in with his broke ass legs. He knows it's going to hurt me more than it's

327
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:39,200
going to hurt him. Yeah. I want, yeah. And I want him to make it easier on me by hurling some really

328
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:44,000
hateful shit. Yeah. Like hateful shit about my parents and loved ones. Oh, like I bet you won't

329
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:50,960
do it. You coward. You coward. We are, we're putting the horse before the cart. Uh, if you've

330
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:57,920
got to, you got to put the horse before the cart, shut your fucking mouth. You got to have,

331
00:29:57,920 --> 00:30:03,040
that's the kind of talk that'll get a horse shot. He has got to be able to talk. He has to possess.

332
00:30:05,280 --> 00:30:12,560
Yeah. Um, which is what's the point, which is rare. Um, I think mayor, but worth worth a couple

333
00:30:12,560 --> 00:30:18,320
extra bucks. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I'll drop an extra. Um, Oh, that's a big, he has to be cheap.

334
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:22,720
You guys did not cost a lot of money. So we need a cheap talking horse that's able to use a

335
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:28,000
smartphone with a lot of my cowboy hat with tenderness. Just discretion for miles. That

336
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:33,600
should be his name. Discretion for miles. Discretion for miles. I want one that doesn't

337
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:39,520
make you kill it to get the glue out of him. Yeah. Give him your glue you stingy bastard.

338
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:46,880
You want to be able to lactate his glue gland for a quick patch job. Um,

339
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:53,200
okay. I think that your horse feet, is it too much to ask for a winning smile?

340
00:30:54,160 --> 00:31:01,280
No, a winning smile. I couldn't, I couldn't understand you. I would like my horse to enjoy

341
00:31:01,280 --> 00:31:08,640
eating apples. Can we make that happen? And oats. Yes. Don't mistake my fingers for carrots.

342
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:14,320
I'm just giving you this carrot. Um, an apologetic course for when he does nibble

343
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:23,200
your fingers. Rainbows behind him leaves rainbows. I want a horse with a horn. Okay. Okay. That is a

344
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:29,600
unicorn, but no, cause it doesn't have to be on his head. It could be, it could also be a deer.

345
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:35,760
Um, like a buck is a buck is basically a horse with a horn. What about a horse with like mini horns

346
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:41,840
that makes it like a spiny exoskeleton. Ah, and maybe fire shoots out of his nose. Yeah. Okay.

347
00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:48,800
Yeah. Yeah. Can I, and he can fly. Uh, and also he's got a big saddle on it. You can ride on him.

348
00:31:48,800 --> 00:31:54,160
And he's got like a tank gun. Yeah. He's got a tank gun for a mouth. He's got like howitzer treads

349
00:31:54,160 --> 00:31:59,840
on his legs. Yeah. Yeah. And he can fucking like fly through space and shit. Yeah. And he's,

350
00:31:59,840 --> 00:32:06,800
he can shoot, he can shoot blood out of him. So fucking discreet. Just discreet as shit. He'll

351
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:12,720
never tell anyone about any of this. I want to ride. Oh, maybe he looks like a regular horse by

352
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:18,080
day and then an awesome space tank spiny leaf by night. Like a he-man. Transformer horse. Yes. Yes.

353
00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:30,320
I'm a tank. I'm a horse. Come here, Shia. Shia, come here. Grab my mane. Feed me oats.

354
00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:34,960
I'm gonna shoot blood out of my face. I'm eight feet tall. I'm a big robot horse. Does it look

355
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:40,560
like a robot horse or does it look like a regular horse that transforms flawlessly into sort of a

356
00:32:40,560 --> 00:32:47,760
fleshy, mane-y. And sprays blood everywhere in the process. And it's killed. That's so important.

357
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:52,240
Shia, you're probably going to want to step back a little bit further. Here's your Gallagher,

358
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:58,880
your Gallagher poncho. Just tuck into that real quick. Transform from a horse into a horse tank.

359
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:05,280
You may get soaked. You will get wet with horse blood. With horse blood. That horse is not going

360
00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:11,200
to survive the transformation process. I'm sorry. I'll never tell anyone. You are rending parts of

361
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:17,120
that horse that you will not be able to reattach. No, no. How come every time we talk about fucking

362
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:21,680
horses on this show, we always talk about just mutilating them? How does that keep happening?

363
00:33:21,680 --> 00:33:24,800
Because there's something about destroying one of God's most beautiful creatures.

364
00:33:24,800 --> 00:33:30,000
It's so powerful and majestic. I just want to kill it.

365
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:33,920
We've been going on this show for about 15 minutes now, designing the perfect horse,

366
00:33:33,920 --> 00:33:40,000
and we reached a point where we reached perfect horse that nobody's ever been

367
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:44,880
able to conceive of before, and then we ruined it. Well, yes.

368
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:51,360
We as human beings often are jealous of the power and majesty of a horse,

369
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:57,680
and then it's time to destroy it. We reached the apex of horse possibilities.

370
00:33:57,680 --> 00:34:02,000
I think that the most important thing about a horse, the most important personality,

371
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:06,400
let's get back to personality for a second. I think the most important personality of a horse

372
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:11,760
is that it not be too beautiful, because then you want to destroy it. If you got some Jared

373
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:16,080
Leto looking motherfucking horse, you're going to want to take a ball peed hammer to its temple

374
00:34:16,080 --> 00:34:21,040
instantly. It's too beautiful. It's just like Fight Club. You just want to destroy something

375
00:34:21,040 --> 00:34:27,040
beautiful, smash its face in with another horse. It's like a Twin Peaks slash glass menagerie

376
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:32,000
glass horse with a horn on it somewhere, and you just want to destroy it.

377
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:36,160
I just want to slam two horses together, find the god particle.

378
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:42,240
Oh, shit. So horses.

379
00:34:43,120 --> 00:34:44,880
I hope no jockeys listen to our show.

380
00:34:46,240 --> 00:34:48,960
I hope no horses listen. There's going to be an uprising.

381
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:53,440
Yeah. And a discrete uprising, but an uprising all the same.

382
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:56,000
Griffin, I think it's time for a take a little trip.

383
00:34:56,720 --> 00:34:59,600
Sure. Let me strap into this roller coaster ride.

384
00:34:59,600 --> 00:35:00,480
Get on the saddle.

385
00:35:01,840 --> 00:35:03,200
The horse, the horse coaster.

386
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:19,680
The horse coaster to the money.

387
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:23,520
Tim Mitchell, Jenna, let me take you back.

388
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:32,640
It's June 23rd, 2007, Des Moines, Iowa, a mountaintop.

389
00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:34,240
Is it angel singing?

390
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:37,520
A discreet horse watches from afar.

391
00:35:40,240 --> 00:35:41,360
And the two of you get married.

392
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:44,240
I mean, kill that horse.

393
00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:54,800
You, Tim, he's a combo geek. Her, domestic goddess, baking, sewing, feng shui, interior designing.

394
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:55,360
No problem.

395
00:35:56,560 --> 00:35:59,760
Put that rug on the south end of the room because it's red.

396
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:01,440
Because it's red.

397
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:02,240
And you're a fire.

398
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:04,880
And we're married for four years.

399
00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:09,120
Did I mean kids in this four years of wedded bliss?

400
00:36:09,120 --> 00:36:12,320
I think it's just around the corner. I have a good feeling about these things,

401
00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:14,400
but they do have an all black cat name.

402
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:15,680
Here we go.

403
00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:17,280
Bagheera.

404
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:18,480
Thank you.

405
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:20,480
And an all white cat named.

406
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:21,200
Luna.

407
00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:22,000
Luna.

408
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:23,920
Cats are practically kids.

409
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:29,120
They're like furry kids that they're like, you know what they are?

410
00:36:29,840 --> 00:36:30,320
Tell me.

411
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:32,640
They're basically furry kids that are tiny.

412
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:34,640
Cats are basically furry kids that are sneaky.

413
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:37,040
Sneaky and they poop in sand.

414
00:36:37,040 --> 00:36:44,160
So by anybody's like system of measurement, they are better than kids.

415
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:46,880
Because sometimes they don't want you around.

416
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:51,440
His nickname for her is too personal to read on a comedy podcast.

417
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:55,600
Her nickname for him is also too personal to read on a comedy podcast,

418
00:36:55,600 --> 00:36:59,040
but it's also funny and possibly embarrassing for him.

419
00:36:59,040 --> 00:36:59,920
That's Choo Choo.

420
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:02,400
Hey, hey, Choo Choo.

421
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:04,240
Come fix his light bulb.

422
00:37:04,240 --> 00:37:08,000
Oh, I don't know. I like, I like his, his nickname for her.

423
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:08,800
I'm just going to say it.

424
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:10,080
It's Bride.

425
00:37:10,080 --> 00:37:11,520
And I like Bride.

426
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:13,200
I like utilitarian.

427
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:13,760
It's yeah.

428
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:16,720
It's very, it's very old school Amish.

429
00:37:16,720 --> 00:37:19,040
Like his name for her is wife.

430
00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:19,280
Yeah.

431
00:37:19,840 --> 00:37:20,400
Wife pride.

432
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:21,440
Goodly wife.

433
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:22,400
Goodly wife.

434
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:23,200
Lady partner.

435
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:26,720
Sately Bridesgroom.

436
00:37:26,720 --> 00:37:28,160
Is it grooms bride?

437
00:37:28,160 --> 00:37:29,280
Is that how that goes?

438
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:30,000
I never understood that.

439
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:30,720
Maidenhead.

440
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:32,400
This is my.

441
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:34,320
Is that, I don't know what that word means.

442
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:35,520
Which I will build my life.

443
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:39,680
She was traded to me for a fattened calf.

444
00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:41,280
And this is Choo Choo.

445
00:37:43,600 --> 00:37:45,360
The strongest man in the village.

446
00:37:45,360 --> 00:37:46,960
The strongest man in the village, Choo Choo.

447
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:48,400
The powerful locomotive.

448
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:50,160
Choo Choo, the titan approaches.

449
00:37:51,600 --> 00:37:52,160
Oh, fuck.

450
00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:55,680
They love to watch movies together and they listen to creative podcasts.

451
00:37:55,680 --> 00:37:56,640
I'm assuming like ours.

452
00:37:56,640 --> 00:37:58,160
So thank you for that.

453
00:37:58,720 --> 00:38:00,000
Also in the money zone.

454
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:01,840
Also taking us along with Choo Choo.

455
00:38:01,840 --> 00:38:04,160
Ride, come on, ride the train and ride it.

456
00:38:04,160 --> 00:38:07,200
Fast karate for the gentlemen.

457
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:11,680
It's a quickly paced, lightly sauced comedy show.

458
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:14,080
Delicately sauced.

459
00:38:14,080 --> 00:38:15,200
It's about video games.

460
00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:17,120
It's about bad Japanese cartoons.

461
00:38:17,120 --> 00:38:22,160
And it only takes you like 30 or 60 minutes to listen to.

462
00:38:22,160 --> 00:38:23,040
That seems like a.

463
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:24,640
So either one or double.

464
00:38:24,640 --> 00:38:28,400
It's kind of a scattershot approach to show time.

465
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:30,720
No, they got the guts to say when it stops working.

466
00:38:30,720 --> 00:38:31,840
Maybe that'll be 30 minutes.

467
00:38:31,840 --> 00:38:32,880
Maybe it'll be 15 minutes.

468
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:33,520
I don't know.

469
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:36,320
Deaf can make it 30, but never above 60.

470
00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:38,080
It's a dumb.

471
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:41,600
It says I'm not saying this about it.

472
00:38:41,600 --> 00:38:43,440
This is what they say about themselves.

473
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:46,560
A dumb podcast recorded by two stupid jerks.

474
00:38:47,120 --> 00:38:51,360
I hope this podcast is not about branding or marketing because they're not good at it.

475
00:38:51,360 --> 00:38:57,120
But what they will do is they'll talk about seminal Kiefer Sutherland pro torture

476
00:38:57,120 --> 00:39:01,360
conservative TV classic 24 and then talk about pudding.

477
00:39:02,160 --> 00:39:02,560
Hold on.

478
00:39:02,560 --> 00:39:03,920
Talk about guardian heroes.

479
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:04,320
Hold on.

480
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:05,040
What?

481
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:05,280
Okay.

482
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:07,920
I don't listen to podcasts.

483
00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:13,280
I would get down on a pudding cast in a heartbeat.

484
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:14,720
Yeah.

485
00:39:14,720 --> 00:39:16,640
Just talking about opportunity.

486
00:39:16,640 --> 00:39:17,440
Jellos.

487
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:18,880
Just talking about flan.

488
00:39:19,840 --> 00:39:22,080
Which buffets had the best selection.

489
00:39:22,080 --> 00:39:26,240
Which golden corral pudding is served at the best temperature with.

490
00:39:26,240 --> 00:39:28,800
You guys ever had that one with Oreo bits in it?

491
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:29,360
Fuck.

492
00:39:29,360 --> 00:39:30,160
Yes, I have.

493
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:35,680
They could do a weekly segment on funny ways to mispronounce crumb brulee.

494
00:39:36,720 --> 00:39:37,600
Spoiler alert.

495
00:39:37,600 --> 00:39:38,720
It's crumb brulee.

496
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:44,160
Crumb brulee sounds like some sort of sportsman.

497
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:47,280
Hey, Frank, bring me some crumb brulee.

498
00:39:49,120 --> 00:39:51,760
You got crumb brulee with the crunchy cinnamon toffee.

499
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:52,560
I can't make it.

500
00:39:52,560 --> 00:39:54,000
I ran out of crumb fresh.

501
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:57,280
If you want to listen to the internet's premier pudding cast,

502
00:39:57,280 --> 00:40:03,520
you can do so at www.daveandjole.com.

503
00:40:03,520 --> 00:40:04,960
That's their website for them.

504
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:05,840
Oh, wow.

505
00:40:05,840 --> 00:40:06,080
Okay.

506
00:40:08,080 --> 00:40:13,600
So thank you to Tim Mitchell who wished his wife Jenna a happy anniversary

507
00:40:13,600 --> 00:40:14,960
and fast karate for the gentlemen.

508
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:20,640
And now my favorite, my favorite moment that I've really been waiting for.

509
00:40:21,520 --> 00:40:22,800
Which acts do you guys want this time?

510
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:24,560
You want standard E tuning or open C?

511
00:40:24,560 --> 00:40:25,440
Because I can do either one.

512
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:27,360
Do you have your double net?

513
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:33,040
Can you just do maybe some drop D?

514
00:40:33,040 --> 00:40:34,960
Is that a tuning option that's open to us?

515
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:37,440
What about middle J?

516
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:41,200
I can take that open C and drop a capo on fret two, and it's basically the same thing.

517
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:42,560
All right, let's do it.

518
00:40:42,560 --> 00:40:43,920
Are you guys still talking about guitars?

519
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:45,600
Yeah.

520
00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:50,320
Travis, I wish you would learn an instrument so that I don't have to keep doing this.

521
00:40:50,320 --> 00:40:53,760
I learned recorder in fourth grade.

522
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:56,240
You can't sing a jingle and play recorder with yourself.

523
00:40:56,960 --> 00:40:57,520
Yes, you can.

524
00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:00,160
Yes, you fucking can.

525
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:01,440
Don't you tell him you can't do that.

526
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:02,560
That's the best idea.

527
00:41:05,040 --> 00:41:05,520
Fuck.

528
00:41:05,520 --> 00:41:09,200
Okay, so a fourth wedding anniversary and a pudding cast.

529
00:41:09,840 --> 00:41:10,320
Thanks.

530
00:41:10,320 --> 00:41:14,560
Hey guys, if like the two of you guys could maybe get together next time

531
00:41:14,560 --> 00:41:18,640
and try and find like two things that have similar thematic elements.

532
00:41:18,640 --> 00:41:20,960
Anything, anything.

533
00:41:20,960 --> 00:41:22,080
By the way, by the way,

534
00:41:23,680 --> 00:41:26,400
paying for a personal message on your wife's,

535
00:41:27,120 --> 00:41:30,960
you and your wife's fourth anniversary is a out loud statement

536
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:34,000
that either us or your marriage will not be here in a year.

537
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:37,360
There's no other message that I could take from that.

538
00:41:37,360 --> 00:41:40,800
And since you love your wife, bride and your husband Chuchu,

539
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:43,440
I can only assume that you're saying we will not be doing this.

540
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:46,880
We better throw this out now because in a year's time, it'll be too late.

541
00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:47,120
Yeah.

542
00:41:47,120 --> 00:41:47,620
Okay.

543
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:49,040
So thanks.

544
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:50,160
Thanks.

545
00:41:50,160 --> 00:41:50,880
I appreciate that.

546
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:56,640
The only thing I can think of right now is the matrimony train.

547
00:41:57,680 --> 00:42:00,880
Take the matrimony train to pudding station.

548
00:42:00,880 --> 00:42:02,800
To pudding new, pudding new station.

549
00:42:04,160 --> 00:42:05,200
Pudding new station?

550
00:42:05,200 --> 00:42:06,960
Is that like Shining Time Station?

551
00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:09,520
Can you do it to the tune of Dave Matthews Band's Crash?

552
00:42:12,480 --> 00:42:14,160
Um, no.

553
00:42:14,160 --> 00:42:21,440
Chuchu and Bride, they eat pudding.

554
00:42:21,440 --> 00:42:22,240
That's good.

555
00:42:22,240 --> 00:42:27,760
See, the problem is that we'll get taken down by a digital millennium copyright act

556
00:42:29,760 --> 00:42:30,800
from D&B himself.

557
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:39,520
That's a little too dark.

558
00:42:40,720 --> 00:42:41,680
Oh, wow.

559
00:42:41,680 --> 00:42:41,920
Yeah.

560
00:42:41,920 --> 00:42:44,240
Get on the matrimony train.

561
00:42:45,600 --> 00:42:48,960
We're gonna take a trip.

562
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:49,600
Nope, Chuch.

563
00:42:49,600 --> 00:42:50,720
I'm gonna use the other guitar.

564
00:42:50,720 --> 00:42:51,680
I think that's the problem.

565
00:42:53,040 --> 00:42:54,080
That's the problem.

566
00:42:54,640 --> 00:42:57,200
It's not that you're trying to write an impromptu song.

567
00:42:57,200 --> 00:42:59,120
A song about fucking wedding and also a pudding podcast.

568
00:43:00,400 --> 00:43:01,200
God damn it.

569
00:43:01,760 --> 00:43:02,640
God damn it.

570
00:43:02,640 --> 00:43:13,200
Can we agree that would be Pudcast?

571
00:43:13,200 --> 00:43:17,760
Hey, who's that coming down the aisle?

572
00:43:19,440 --> 00:43:30,960
It's a beautiful woman in white and she's carrying in her left hand a tube of gogurt

573
00:43:30,960 --> 00:43:44,560
and her man on one arm she has her chuchu in the other arm she has the aforementioned

574
00:43:44,560 --> 00:43:51,600
gogurt and she's slurping down the gogurt and she's saying her vows they have for long

575
00:43:51,600 --> 00:43:57,440
years together and they're not stopping now they're on the matrimony train

576
00:43:57,440 --> 00:44:01,280
to pudding town

577
00:44:08,320 --> 00:44:08,820
Yay!

578
00:44:09,520 --> 00:44:10,800
That was good.

579
00:44:10,800 --> 00:44:11,760
Hold up.

580
00:44:11,760 --> 00:44:13,120
I'm not positive though.

581
00:44:14,720 --> 00:44:16,560
Is gogurt yogurt?

582
00:44:17,920 --> 00:44:19,280
Gogurt is definitely yogurt.

583
00:44:19,280 --> 00:44:22,080
I'm gonna say there's a 50% chance that gogurt is pudding.

584
00:44:22,080 --> 00:44:26,640
I think that it's like squares and rectangles where not all gogurts are pudding but all

585
00:44:26,640 --> 00:44:27,360
puddings are gogurt.

586
00:44:27,360 --> 00:44:28,080
Well, here's the thing.

587
00:44:29,600 --> 00:44:33,520
Yogurt is basically bullshit nasty pudding with cultures in it.

588
00:44:34,800 --> 00:44:35,040
Right.

589
00:44:35,040 --> 00:44:37,120
To help Jamie Lee Curtis do her poopies.

590
00:44:40,080 --> 00:44:41,600
It says that right on the box.

591
00:44:42,960 --> 00:44:46,320
Slam this gogurt and have regular beaners like JLC.

592
00:44:46,320 --> 00:44:50,560
Slam down this gogurt and then enjoy a Jamie Lee Curtis style poopy.

593
00:44:50,560 --> 00:44:56,000
Every time a child eats a gogurt, Jamie Lee Curtis makes a poopy.

594
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:56,800
Oh god.

595
00:44:56,800 --> 00:44:59,120
That must explain why she hasn't been doing much acting lately.

596
00:45:00,880 --> 00:45:02,320
Yogurt got so popular.

597
00:45:03,040 --> 00:45:07,760
Kids, stop eating gogurt for the love of Jamie Lee Curtis.

598
00:45:07,760 --> 00:45:08,800
Please lay off the gogurt.

599
00:45:08,800 --> 00:45:09,760
She's so tired.

600
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:12,800
So raw.

601
00:45:12,800 --> 00:45:14,160
It's so raw.

602
00:45:14,160 --> 00:45:16,320
I wish I could trade places with anybody.

603
00:45:16,320 --> 00:45:17,680
Kids, please stop.

604
00:45:17,680 --> 00:45:19,040
This is no true lie.

605
00:45:19,040 --> 00:45:25,600
So if you would like your own jingle and spot in the money zone, you can contact

606
00:45:25,600 --> 00:45:29,920
Teresa Thorn at Teresa at maximum fun dot org.

607
00:45:29,920 --> 00:45:30,800
Teresa with an H.

608
00:45:31,360 --> 00:45:37,600
My boyfriend and I disagree on what the term underwear for women refers to.

609
00:45:38,160 --> 00:45:43,600
I told him it's just the bottoms, but he's convinced it's both bra and panties.

610
00:45:43,600 --> 00:45:48,800
Oh, Justin, you said that in the grossest way imaginable.

611
00:45:48,800 --> 00:45:50,560
To be fair, it's the grossest word.

612
00:45:50,560 --> 00:45:51,760
It's the worst word.

613
00:45:51,760 --> 00:45:53,440
Just panties.

614
00:45:53,440 --> 00:45:54,400
Oh, god.

615
00:45:54,400 --> 00:45:56,640
What do you guys think?

616
00:45:56,640 --> 00:45:57,600
His name's Jeff.

617
00:45:58,320 --> 00:46:03,680
So if you could prove him wrong, prove, because that's what we're into on NBA scientific proof.

618
00:46:03,680 --> 00:46:06,160
We're going to peer review this shit hypothesis.

619
00:46:08,080 --> 00:46:13,920
My hypothesis is that underwear for ladies and this is just my opening statement.

620
00:46:13,920 --> 00:46:20,160
OK, I believe that underwear for ladies refers to both bra and panties.

621
00:46:20,160 --> 00:46:23,040
Oh, God, please, please, please.

622
00:46:23,040 --> 00:46:24,320
Let me just say bottoms.

623
00:46:24,320 --> 00:46:28,480
Can we say bottoms and avoid that we just can we say bottoms?

624
00:46:28,480 --> 00:46:30,560
Can we just say girl boxers or girl briefs?

625
00:46:30,560 --> 00:46:31,040
Yeah.

626
00:46:31,040 --> 00:46:36,000
Or like, OK, we can we can remove panties from the discussion because that's the last time

627
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:38,880
you get to say that word without me quitting the podcast forever.

628
00:46:39,440 --> 00:46:40,640
OK, obviously.

629
00:46:40,640 --> 00:46:41,200
What is it?

630
00:46:41,200 --> 00:46:42,160
Just the pronunciation?

631
00:46:42,640 --> 00:46:46,960
You're saying it like some kind of super villain that seals women's underwear and collects

632
00:46:46,960 --> 00:46:47,920
it in a cave.

633
00:46:48,480 --> 00:46:51,600
So so no more no more discussion of panties.

634
00:46:51,600 --> 00:46:58,080
Um, I think that the the the the discussion, the debate is really over bra.

635
00:46:59,040 --> 00:47:00,720
I think that it only refers to bottoms.

636
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:02,480
Really?

637
00:47:02,480 --> 00:47:10,240
Yeah, because, OK, take the the bottoms out of the equation and a girl just putting on

638
00:47:10,240 --> 00:47:12,160
her bra saying, I'm putting on my underwear.

639
00:47:12,960 --> 00:47:14,000
She's a crazy person.

640
00:47:14,880 --> 00:47:17,440
Oh, man, that's a pretty good argument.

641
00:47:17,440 --> 00:47:19,440
That is a really, really good argument.

642
00:47:19,440 --> 00:47:20,000
I know, right?

643
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:22,320
Can we just can we get rid of the nomenclature altogether?

644
00:47:22,320 --> 00:47:28,320
And can we just call like just come up with a specific like but like your your your panties

645
00:47:28,320 --> 00:47:36,160
will now be called bottom bottom shorts and your bra is can be called like boob shorts.

646
00:47:36,160 --> 00:47:37,040
Your booby shorts.

647
00:47:37,040 --> 00:47:37,760
Your booby shorts.

648
00:47:37,760 --> 00:47:40,320
These are shorts for your boobs so that nobody can see them.

649
00:47:41,440 --> 00:47:44,160
Hey, get those cans and some booby shorts today.

650
00:47:44,160 --> 00:47:53,440
Uh huh, uh, I OK, I think Travis has in in sort of unprecedented feet from a brother

651
00:47:53,440 --> 00:47:54,480
of a brother than me.

652
00:47:54,480 --> 00:47:59,600
Travis is sort of single handedly, I think, won this argument because I think that the

653
00:47:59,600 --> 00:48:03,760
thing about, you know, separating it, saying like, that's my underwear.

654
00:48:04,640 --> 00:48:05,840
That's weird as shit, right?

655
00:48:05,840 --> 00:48:06,240
It's weird.

656
00:48:06,240 --> 00:48:13,360
And you can't say on the following that you can't say I am I am wearing I'm wearing booby

657
00:48:13,360 --> 00:48:19,280
shorts but no panties, so I am wearing my underwear and it's like I beg to differ.

658
00:48:19,280 --> 00:48:23,280
I like putting on a shirt and saying this is my chest pants like it's craziness.

659
00:48:23,280 --> 00:48:25,120
That means you look like a crazy person.

660
00:48:25,120 --> 00:48:27,040
I think that case closed.

661
00:48:27,040 --> 00:48:27,840
Final solution.

662
00:48:28,480 --> 00:48:29,120
Sorry, Jeff.

663
00:48:29,120 --> 00:48:31,200
So Jeff, you're wrong.

664
00:48:31,200 --> 00:48:32,320
Sorry, Jeff.

665
00:48:32,320 --> 00:48:33,200
You're so wrong.

666
00:48:33,920 --> 00:48:37,840
Welcome to a new segment of my brother, my brother and me, where we stop giving advice

667
00:48:37,840 --> 00:48:39,840
and just belittle someone's opinion.

668
00:48:39,840 --> 00:48:40,480
Hey, Jeff.

669
00:48:41,680 --> 00:48:42,480
You're stupid.

670
00:48:42,480 --> 00:48:44,160
Can we just get rid of it?

671
00:48:44,160 --> 00:48:46,400
Can we just get rid of this whole thing altogether?

672
00:48:46,400 --> 00:48:48,880
Just you mean the whole bra panty enterprise?

673
00:48:48,880 --> 00:48:50,640
Let him breathe, ladies.

674
00:48:50,640 --> 00:48:51,280
Yeah.

675
00:48:51,280 --> 00:48:55,600
Oh, you're saying like the real tangible items.

676
00:48:56,640 --> 00:48:58,880
So Griffin, which which frat did you rush?

677
00:48:58,880 --> 00:48:59,440
I'm curious.

678
00:49:00,240 --> 00:49:08,400
Delta, Delta, Delta, Delta, Delta, Delta, Delta, Delta, they're good.

679
00:49:08,400 --> 00:49:12,800
Quint Delta fucking killer ultimate Frisbee team.

680
00:49:12,800 --> 00:49:15,200
We wanted that Delta so it could be sexed out.

681
00:49:16,240 --> 00:49:18,480
But nobody we couldn't have it.

682
00:49:18,480 --> 00:49:19,600
It wouldn't give it ridiculous.

683
00:49:21,120 --> 00:49:22,640
Griffin, you know what I need?

684
00:49:22,640 --> 00:49:24,720
I said a gross thing in there about getting rid of panties.

685
00:49:24,720 --> 00:49:26,400
So ladies can let him breathe.

686
00:49:26,400 --> 00:49:29,680
And it's like that was so grody to like even joke about.

687
00:49:29,680 --> 00:49:31,920
And I don't know if I should like cut it out of the show or no.

688
00:49:33,920 --> 00:49:37,200
But if you don't say the gross thing about letting him breathe, we can't joke about Quint

689
00:49:37,200 --> 00:49:37,920
Delta.

690
00:49:37,920 --> 00:49:38,480
That's right.

691
00:49:38,480 --> 00:49:38,880
Fuck.

692
00:49:38,880 --> 00:49:40,560
You got to die on the comedy cross.

693
00:49:42,320 --> 00:49:43,840
How about man?

694
00:49:43,840 --> 00:49:44,640
Fuck it, guys.

695
00:49:44,640 --> 00:49:46,560
I have like five really, really good ones.

696
00:49:47,680 --> 00:49:48,000
Good.

697
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:51,120
Maybe next time you won't have to hound our dear sweet listeners.

698
00:49:51,120 --> 00:49:54,320
You just keep your own strategic reserve.

699
00:49:54,320 --> 00:49:57,520
We're going to do this one because it's the fucking craziest thing I've ever read.

700
00:49:58,160 --> 00:49:59,840
It's by Jacob Locker, of course.

701
00:50:00,480 --> 00:50:03,440
It's by Yahoo Answers user Gabby Bennett, who asks.

702
00:50:03,440 --> 00:50:06,320
Why would my grandpa kiss my foot?

703
00:50:07,200 --> 00:50:13,120
Why was I was I was I was getting a much needed foot massage for my grandpa.

704
00:50:13,120 --> 00:50:15,280
Scott, you know, stop it with Seuss.

705
00:50:15,840 --> 00:50:19,520
And when he kissed and when he finished, he kissed my foot.

706
00:50:19,520 --> 00:50:20,400
Should I be worried?

707
00:50:21,120 --> 00:50:22,160
Additional details.

708
00:50:22,160 --> 00:50:24,640
Well, he's technically my grandpa by marriage.

709
00:50:24,640 --> 00:50:29,200
He married my grandma in March, but he gave my mom a foot massage and she said she was

710
00:50:29,200 --> 00:50:30,000
weirded out.

711
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:36,640
So there's a there's a first of all, roaming step grandpa giving foot rubs to everybody.

712
00:50:36,640 --> 00:50:38,240
Get him out of the house.

713
00:50:38,240 --> 00:50:44,080
There's precedent set by the mom getting the massage and not particularly enjoying it.

714
00:50:44,080 --> 00:50:45,760
So that's pretty crazy, right?

715
00:50:45,760 --> 00:50:47,760
That's like a crazy fucking thing.

716
00:50:47,760 --> 00:50:49,680
That's like a crazy, crazy thing.

717
00:50:49,680 --> 00:50:50,720
How about some of these?

718
00:50:50,720 --> 00:50:54,240
Let's let's dip into these answers and just like, you know, let's pull the crowd.

719
00:50:54,240 --> 00:50:55,200
Let's pull the audience.

720
00:50:55,200 --> 00:50:56,160
Pull the audience.

721
00:50:56,160 --> 00:50:58,080
Let's phone a friend on Yahoo.

722
00:50:58,080 --> 00:51:00,880
Answer one, Jacob Cahill says, what?

723
00:51:00,880 --> 00:51:02,560
No, he's your grandpa and he loves you.

724
00:51:02,560 --> 00:51:03,600
That's a good thing.

725
00:51:03,600 --> 00:51:04,960
He's not our grandpa.

726
00:51:04,960 --> 00:51:07,520
No, that one's got to be like a crazy outlier, right?

727
00:51:07,520 --> 00:51:08,800
Well, answer it.

728
00:51:08,800 --> 00:51:14,320
I just want to throw out real quick that he's only been her grandpa for like three months.

729
00:51:14,320 --> 00:51:14,800
Right.

730
00:51:14,800 --> 00:51:17,120
Pretty much not your grandpa yet.

731
00:51:17,920 --> 00:51:20,560
You got to earn that title over at least a period of half a year.

732
00:51:20,560 --> 00:51:22,240
Gabe Fore says, not at all.

733
00:51:22,240 --> 00:51:23,840
He's just being a loving grandpa.

734
00:51:23,840 --> 00:51:25,840
It's like a kiss on the forehead or something like that.

735
00:51:25,840 --> 00:51:29,440
Being a loving grandpa, it's like a kiss on the forehead or something, but just a loving thing.

736
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:30,240
No.

737
00:51:31,040 --> 00:51:33,120
It would be weird if he was touchy or kissed you on the lips.

738
00:51:33,120 --> 00:51:35,440
But a kiss on the foot is just a loving grandpa thing.

739
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:37,440
What are you saying?

740
00:51:37,440 --> 00:51:38,400
How is your grandpa?

741
00:51:38,400 --> 00:51:41,760
What kind of fucking situation is going on in America with our grand-

742
00:51:41,760 --> 00:51:43,520
What is our grandpa situation like that?

743
00:51:43,520 --> 00:51:45,120
Everyone's like, no, it's completely normal.

744
00:51:45,120 --> 00:51:47,280
My grandpappy kisses me on the feet all the time.

745
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:49,680
Elizabeth says, I don't think so.

746
00:51:50,960 --> 00:51:51,840
Stop it, gramps.

747
00:51:52,640 --> 00:51:54,400
Elizabeth says, I don't think so.

748
00:51:54,400 --> 00:51:57,120
Was it a small peck kind of kiss or a deep passionate kiss?

749
00:51:57,120 --> 00:51:58,320
And you know what doesn't matter?

750
00:51:58,880 --> 00:52:00,560
Hey, Elizabeth, it kind of doesn't matter.

751
00:52:02,240 --> 00:52:04,320
Deep passionate kiss, creepy.

752
00:52:04,320 --> 00:52:07,520
Quick peck on the foot, just as creepy.

753
00:52:07,520 --> 00:52:10,400
Like, did you put the tip in or did you go shafty?

754
00:52:10,400 --> 00:52:10,880
Doesn't matter.

755
00:52:10,880 --> 00:52:11,680
You're pregnant.

756
00:52:11,680 --> 00:52:12,960
Like it's over.

757
00:52:12,960 --> 00:52:13,760
It's over.

758
00:52:13,760 --> 00:52:16,080
You can only get so foot creepy wet.

759
00:52:17,440 --> 00:52:20,560
Chiquita Bonita says, no, I think you're just taking it a little too weird

760
00:52:20,560 --> 00:52:22,480
because it's not something that you're used to.

761
00:52:22,480 --> 00:52:24,800
This is, guys, I'm not leaving any answers out.

762
00:52:24,800 --> 00:52:27,280
Wait, say that one one more time.

763
00:52:27,280 --> 00:52:30,160
It's only creepy because it's not something you're used to?

764
00:52:30,160 --> 00:52:31,680
Because it's not something you're used to.

765
00:52:32,400 --> 00:52:34,960
Isn't that kind of the definition of like weird?

766
00:52:34,960 --> 00:52:35,460
Yeah.

767
00:52:36,320 --> 00:52:36,800
I'm-

768
00:52:36,800 --> 00:52:39,600
No, you just think it's weird because it's something that's never happened before.

769
00:52:39,600 --> 00:52:40,960
It's completely unacceptable.

770
00:52:40,960 --> 00:52:44,400
To a certain level of my grandpa kissing my sweet feet.

771
00:52:45,280 --> 00:52:46,080
Uh-huh.

772
00:52:46,080 --> 00:52:47,600
Guys, it's not funny anymore.

773
00:52:47,600 --> 00:52:51,280
I can't laugh about this.

774
00:52:51,280 --> 00:52:57,440
There is a nation of people who says it might be a good luck superstition,

775
00:52:57,440 --> 00:52:58,880
or he thinks of you as royalty.

776
00:52:59,680 --> 00:53:01,440
Yeah, because that's exactly what it is.

777
00:53:01,440 --> 00:53:02,080
Nailed it.

778
00:53:02,080 --> 00:53:03,120
By reason it is.

779
00:53:03,120 --> 00:53:08,880
There are a bunch of people on the internet and they think that it's okay for their-

780
00:53:08,880 --> 00:53:10,560
Like it's not funny to me anymore.

781
00:53:10,560 --> 00:53:15,120
BeautifulTip1 says, I think he was just trying to show honest, innocent affection.

782
00:53:15,120 --> 00:53:16,000
Nothing curvy.

783
00:53:16,720 --> 00:53:20,000
Nothing a grandpa does is innocent ever.

784
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:24,400
Our grandpas are trying to keep their raging old man libido back

785
00:53:24,400 --> 00:53:28,160
and you let them wrap their digits around some tea bopper's foot

786
00:53:28,800 --> 00:53:30,720
and her feet still-

787
00:53:30,720 --> 00:53:34,400
Their feet still sway from being inside those hush puppies all day

788
00:53:34,400 --> 00:53:36,480
and you can't expect the man not to kiss them.

789
00:53:36,480 --> 00:53:38,400
You're fucking grossing me out, Gramps.

790
00:53:38,400 --> 00:53:39,680
Get out of here, you old man.

791
00:53:40,800 --> 00:53:41,600
There are eight-

792
00:53:42,320 --> 00:53:44,880
There are eight answers on this question.

793
00:53:45,520 --> 00:53:46,560
All of them are.

794
00:53:47,120 --> 00:53:48,720
No, he's being a grandpa.

795
00:53:48,720 --> 00:53:50,080
Here, here's a Werther's.

796
00:53:50,080 --> 00:53:51,760
Let me suck them toes.

797
00:53:51,760 --> 00:53:54,480
Hey, hey, I want to take this one a little deeper.

798
00:53:55,360 --> 00:53:59,280
Why did she have to go on the internet to find out if this was weird or not?

799
00:53:59,280 --> 00:54:04,720
What have we done to our nation's youth that has made them like require the internet for a second opinion?

800
00:54:04,720 --> 00:54:06,560
Do we need to drop some PSAs?

801
00:54:06,560 --> 00:54:10,640
Hey, uh, Peepaw, I just logged on on your Pentium computer.

802
00:54:10,640 --> 00:54:12,960
Why do you have eight Yahoo Answers accounts?

803
00:54:12,960 --> 00:54:17,440
What is the purpose of those?

804
00:54:17,440 --> 00:54:19,120
Of those right now.

805
00:54:21,360 --> 00:54:23,200
Griffin, I want to hear your last question.

806
00:54:23,200 --> 00:54:26,480
And I know that we could stay here and joke about this all day.

807
00:54:26,480 --> 00:54:27,840
It's not fucking humorous.

808
00:54:27,840 --> 00:54:32,160
Like, this makes you want to cry into a cup of poison.

809
00:54:32,160 --> 00:54:36,400
I'm completely happy joking about killing God's most beautiful creature.

810
00:54:37,120 --> 00:54:41,200
When it comes to kissing little girl's feet, game over.

811
00:54:41,200 --> 00:54:46,800
I would rather ride a beautiful horse and not kill it than continue to talk about this.

812
00:54:46,800 --> 00:54:52,720
Every time you grandpa kisses their their offspring's offspring's feet,

813
00:54:53,280 --> 00:54:57,040
step offspring step offspring step their step offspring offspring's feet.

814
00:54:57,840 --> 00:54:59,440
A horse is destroyed.

815
00:54:59,440 --> 00:55:01,760
And also, Jamie Lee Curtis has a bowel movement.

816
00:55:03,520 --> 00:55:04,800
So she's a busy lady.

817
00:55:04,800 --> 00:55:07,920
She has a lot on her plate because she has to.

818
00:55:07,920 --> 00:55:11,680
Well, to be fair, she never should have signed that sponsorship contract.

819
00:55:11,680 --> 00:55:13,600
Yeah, she should have read it first.

820
00:55:13,600 --> 00:55:14,160
She should have.

821
00:55:14,160 --> 00:55:14,720
She should have.

822
00:55:14,720 --> 00:55:20,400
Uh, yeah, it's a fine print forever and ever.

823
00:55:21,040 --> 00:55:22,880
I want to hear his last question first.

824
00:55:22,880 --> 00:55:24,720
A couple of real quick housekeeping things.

825
00:55:24,720 --> 00:55:31,280
Thank you to female Kyle for posting the Equus video, I guess.

826
00:55:31,280 --> 00:55:33,040
Thank you, I guess.

827
00:55:33,040 --> 00:55:34,000
Yeah, thanks for that.

828
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:38,640
I love that the top Google result is a video of my of my brother

829
00:55:38,640 --> 00:55:40,640
penetrating my butt with a beer bottle.

830
00:55:40,640 --> 00:55:45,120
That's really good, so my future job opportunities in short are

831
00:55:45,120 --> 00:55:46,640
five years get pretty weird.

832
00:55:46,640 --> 00:55:47,200
You should come out.

833
00:55:47,200 --> 00:55:52,160
Um, that's OK, guys, because I was pretending to be a horse.

834
00:55:52,160 --> 00:55:54,400
So it's totally so it's totally fine.

835
00:55:54,400 --> 00:55:55,840
That was five thirteen.

836
00:55:55,840 --> 00:55:56,560
That's Lori.

837
00:55:56,560 --> 00:56:01,280
Uh, uh, confirm that Travis looked hubba hubba at the live show.

838
00:56:01,280 --> 00:56:04,400
Do you want to point out Travis put together these Twitter shout outs?

839
00:56:04,400 --> 00:56:07,360
So I was I was flattered.

840
00:56:07,360 --> 00:56:11,040
I was flattered, and I agree.

841
00:56:12,160 --> 00:56:14,080
Media underscore fairy.

842
00:56:14,720 --> 00:56:18,000
She risked her job to convert to customers.

843
00:56:19,360 --> 00:56:22,400
So thank you to an emergency brain surgeon.

844
00:56:23,200 --> 00:56:25,760
And what she did was she got deep down in someone's cerebrum

845
00:56:26,800 --> 00:56:28,960
and then I touched the part of their brain that made them like

846
00:56:28,960 --> 00:56:30,320
listening to the weird podcasts.

847
00:56:31,760 --> 00:56:32,560
So thank you for that.

848
00:56:32,560 --> 00:56:33,360
That's just right.

849
00:56:33,360 --> 00:56:35,920
God, we got an email from Kara.

850
00:56:35,920 --> 00:56:40,080
And Kara asked why we don't have a fan club and that she wanted to

851
00:56:40,080 --> 00:56:43,120
start a fan club and how to do that and all that kind of stuff

852
00:56:43,120 --> 00:56:44,880
called the maximum fund.org.

853
00:56:46,080 --> 00:56:47,200
That's not a fan club.

854
00:56:47,200 --> 00:56:49,920
Like that's the nomenclature of fan club.

855
00:56:51,200 --> 00:56:53,280
By the way, fun drinking game for this episode.

856
00:56:53,280 --> 00:56:56,320
Every time we say the word nomenclature, just take a sip of your beverage.

857
00:56:56,320 --> 00:56:57,440
Yeah, it's it's not.

858
00:56:57,440 --> 00:57:04,320
It's a it's a it's a fan community, a think tank of like minded individuals.

859
00:57:04,320 --> 00:57:06,480
OK, I like that tank.

860
00:57:07,520 --> 00:57:10,960
And and it's it's a great it's a great community and you should be on there.

861
00:57:10,960 --> 00:57:12,080
They're good people.

862
00:57:12,080 --> 00:57:14,400
You should also be listening to all the other maximum fun shows.

863
00:57:15,040 --> 00:57:16,720
Yeah, I think the people who I meant to mention,

864
00:57:16,720 --> 00:57:18,880
the people who asked about panty nomenclature.

865
00:57:20,240 --> 00:57:22,080
Panty, did you say that you should really?

866
00:57:22,080 --> 00:57:26,000
That's a question for for the John Hodgman Hodgman podcast.

867
00:57:27,520 --> 00:57:30,160
That's more his wheelhouse, our close personal friend.

868
00:57:30,160 --> 00:57:37,520
John are basically our best friend and second dad and step grandfather.

869
00:57:37,520 --> 00:57:39,440
Jordan, just to get out and self-podcast yourself.

870
00:57:40,960 --> 00:57:43,360
Also, and this is speaking of maximum fun,

871
00:57:44,640 --> 00:57:51,280
the main reason you need to get over there is you need to see the MBMB AM super show,

872
00:57:51,280 --> 00:57:53,120
which is a cartoon made by Christopew,

873
00:57:53,120 --> 00:57:56,560
Sean Depew, the Depew brothers will put it in the forums.

874
00:57:56,560 --> 00:58:02,640
You can also go to bit.ly forward slash MBMB AM tune one.

875
00:58:02,640 --> 00:58:04,320
That's a little shortcut.

876
00:58:04,320 --> 00:58:05,600
Pretty good URL you got there.

877
00:58:06,240 --> 00:58:08,400
It's really, really fantastic.

878
00:58:08,400 --> 00:58:13,200
We can't thank the Depew brothers enough because it's it's it's unthinkably magical.

879
00:58:13,200 --> 00:58:16,080
It's a cartoon of one of our bits.

880
00:58:16,080 --> 00:58:18,080
If you want to see more of them,

881
00:58:19,040 --> 00:58:21,520
if you would write them a giant check,

882
00:58:21,520 --> 00:58:24,640
a giant novelty check to keep making them because you love them so much,

883
00:58:24,640 --> 00:58:29,760
let let them know, let us know, talk about it in the forums, share your adoration.

884
00:58:29,760 --> 00:58:32,960
We'll put it up there right as soon as we're done recording this SOTO.

885
00:58:32,960 --> 00:58:36,800
It'll be there and you should check it totally out.

886
00:58:38,400 --> 00:58:39,280
Is that everything?

887
00:58:39,280 --> 00:58:42,800
I want to thank Mr. Bob Ball.

888
00:58:42,800 --> 00:58:43,920
Oh, yeah.

889
00:58:43,920 --> 00:58:48,160
Bob Ball does the voice intro for a show every single week.

890
00:58:48,160 --> 00:58:51,360
He flies to one of our houses and he records it fresh

891
00:58:51,360 --> 00:58:55,120
because he he doesn't like to he doesn't like the sound to get stale, he says,

892
00:58:55,120 --> 00:58:58,720
which like we've tried to explain to him that that's physically not how it works,

893
00:58:58,720 --> 00:58:59,760
but he won't have it.

894
00:59:01,280 --> 00:59:02,080
Freshest sounds.

895
00:59:02,080 --> 00:59:02,800
That's all he'll settle for.

896
00:59:02,800 --> 00:59:04,000
Thank you so much, Bob Ball.

897
00:59:04,960 --> 00:59:06,560
And thank you, of course, to all of you.

898
00:59:06,560 --> 00:59:11,760
If you get a second, please tell somebody that you care about to listen to the show.

899
00:59:11,760 --> 00:59:18,160
Send them a link to our sampler bit.ly forward slash it's MBMB AM.

900
00:59:18,800 --> 00:59:20,000
And we haven't mentioned in a while,

901
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:24,480
but if if you've joined the show in like the last 20 or so episodes

902
00:59:24,480 --> 00:59:28,880
and you haven't yet gone on iTunes and thrown us a ranking or a view or something,

903
00:59:28,880 --> 00:59:30,000
we always appreciate it.

904
00:59:31,360 --> 00:59:32,640
So we've got an app there, too.

905
00:59:33,200 --> 00:59:37,280
An MBMB AM app experience that you can get on iTunes.

906
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:40,400
Also, Happy Father's Day.

907
00:59:40,400 --> 00:59:41,200
Yeah.

908
00:59:41,200 --> 00:59:42,640
Hey, Papa McElroy.

909
00:59:42,640 --> 00:59:43,920
Happy Father's Day.

910
00:59:43,920 --> 00:59:48,880
You know, we should get everybody listening to the show to like message or do a tweet

911
00:59:48,880 --> 00:59:53,120
at McClint, M-A-C-C-L-I-N-T.

912
00:59:53,120 --> 00:59:54,320
I think it's just one word.

913
00:59:54,320 --> 00:59:55,440
It's just Twitter handle.

914
00:59:55,440 --> 00:59:57,120
Just like send him a message saying,

915
00:59:57,120 --> 00:59:58,960
hey, you're like a really good dad.

916
00:59:59,600 --> 01:00:00,480
Good job, Dad.

917
01:00:00,480 --> 01:00:03,040
Thanks for spawning three awesome children.

918
01:00:03,040 --> 01:00:03,440
Yeah.

919
01:00:03,440 --> 01:00:04,560
Well, four.

920
01:00:04,560 --> 01:00:05,760
And then we lost Terry.

921
01:00:05,760 --> 01:00:06,000
Yeah.

922
01:00:06,880 --> 01:00:08,240
He was a bad guy.

923
01:00:08,240 --> 01:00:09,440
Didn't have the chops.

924
01:00:09,440 --> 01:00:10,880
Couldn't have the chops to cut it.

925
01:00:10,880 --> 01:00:11,380
Life.

926
01:00:12,160 --> 01:00:13,760
Griffin, last question.

927
01:00:13,760 --> 01:00:14,160
I'm ready.

928
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:16,800
Okay.

929
01:00:16,800 --> 01:00:20,400
Feel around your skin.

930
01:00:20,400 --> 01:00:22,080
This one was sent in by Krista Whalen.

931
01:00:22,080 --> 01:00:22,800
Thank you, Krista.

932
01:00:23,520 --> 01:00:27,440
It's by Yahoo Answers user Chinny Yo, who says,

933
01:00:29,680 --> 01:00:33,120
my son thinks that high school is going to be like high school musical.

934
01:00:33,120 --> 01:00:33,840
What should I do?

935
01:00:36,400 --> 01:00:37,440
I'm Justin McElroy.

936
01:00:37,440 --> 01:00:38,640
I'm Travis McElroy.

937
01:00:38,640 --> 01:00:39,760
I'm Griffin McElroy.

938
01:00:39,760 --> 01:00:40,400
You're my brother.

939
01:00:40,400 --> 01:00:41,120
My brother and me.

940
01:00:41,120 --> 01:00:42,240
Kiss your dad.

941
01:00:42,240 --> 01:00:47,200
Oh, right on the lip.

942
01:00:47,200 --> 01:00:48,960
Keep your heart, Three Stacks.

943
01:00:48,960 --> 01:00:50,000
Keep your heart.

944
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:52,160
Hey, keep your heart, Three Stacks.

945
01:00:52,160 --> 01:00:53,120
Keep your heart.

946
01:00:53,120 --> 01:00:54,480
Man, these girls are smart.

947
01:00:54,480 --> 01:00:56,240
Three Stacks, these girls are smart.

948
01:00:56,240 --> 01:01:12,240
Keep your heart, Three Stacks, keep your heart, Three Stacks, keep your heart, Three Stacks.
