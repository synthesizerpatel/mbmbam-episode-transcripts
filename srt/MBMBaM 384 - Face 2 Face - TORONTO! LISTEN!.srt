1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:31,120
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:31,120 --> 00:00:45,120
It's a new craze, and good girls do you want it? Just say, hey I wanna. Just say, hey I wanna.

6
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:50,880
Begin. Hello everyone and welcome to My Brother, My Brother and Me, an advice show for the modern

7
00:00:50,880 --> 00:01:04,800
era. I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy. I'm your middle-est brother, Travis McElroy.

8
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:15,440
And I'm your sweet baby brother and 30 under 30 media luminary, Griffin McElroy.

9
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:27,840
Just real quick, two super technical things. One, there's a clock on stage that I think

10
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:32,960
is supposed to be counting down, but it's not moving. Sometimes it feels like time's not moving

11
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:37,840
while we're doing this show. And two, someone's recording this, right? Like I didn't check this

12
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:43,680
beforehand, but it's fine. We apparently are going to spend, you can't see this,

13
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:49,360
we're going to keep up with the theme of things you can't also see. We are staring at two huge

14
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:55,920
televisions that are just displaying our picture. The ones that were there, remember just a second

15
00:01:55,920 --> 00:02:01,280
ago? We're apparently going to be fucking barreling those for the entire- Don't take that away. No,

16
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:06,400
don't take it away because it reminds me how damn handsome I am. What a handsome boy. Look at that

17
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:12,400
hair. Also, I'm going to give you, the audience, pretty much a 100% guarantee this is not the

18
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:21,280
biggest table we've ever worked with. There is going to be a big spill of our absolute coffee

19
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:29,440
drinks. I have two coffee drinks. Thank you all for coming here and thank you to PodCon for having

20
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:42,960
us. With the response of just like a loud exclamation, how's your PodCon going? All right,

21
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:50,080
now the nays. Who's having a really shitty PodCon? No. Everybody, just tell me your favorite panel

22
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:56,160
so far at the same time. One, two, three, go. Cool, cool, cool. A lot of people said yours,

23
00:02:56,160 --> 00:03:03,120
which I feel is a cheat. I'm really excited being here surrounded by creators and just realizing

24
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:10,000
I'm going to start so many new podcasts. Yeah. I'm starting a new one, a collabo,

25
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:16,000
me and Lauren Swar from Criminal were on a panel earlier today, and we're doing a new true crime

26
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:23,760
podcast called Ah, Real Murder. It's really good. It's great. It's like we aren't going to do

27
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:30,400
research at all. Yeah. My theory is that there's been a trillion people who've ever been on earth,

28
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:35,440
right? Yeah. Law of large numbers, somebody's been murdered in every conceivable way.

29
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:42,560
I can just talk about there was one dude who got drowned in a bunch of horsey sauce from Arby's,

30
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:47,840
and it's probably true. Probably true. Yeah. I'm going to start a new one with Kevin Porter

31
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:55,920
from Gilmore Guys, where we watch and discuss every episode of Entourage and we call it Entourage.

32
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:03,600
Is there any way I can presubscribe to that? Because here's the thing, maybe it's good.

33
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:07,760
No. It's not, but what my book presupposes is...

34
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:16,880
My new thing's a solo project. It's about the pest and it's called Save the Pest for Last,

35
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:22,320
and it's a thrilling docudrama about me. There's a John Leguizamo movie called The Pest.

36
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:24,720
Sorry. I'm sorry, Griffin. A John Leguizamo vehicle.

37
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:31,680
It drives right off a cliff. Right off a cliff into a shark tank or something,

38
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:35,520
and it has a really Buckwild intro. It's not especially funny to talk about on the stage.

39
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:40,000
And it's not funny to watch. No, this is the problem though. I'm glad we've hit on it,

40
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:45,520
sort of arrived at it organically. We've been doing a lot more live shows and what we find is

41
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:52,720
it's hard to sort of sit in, sit out, keep the energy up. And we're just three boring guys.

42
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:55,040
I mean, we just did Tacoma last night. I know.

43
00:04:58,640 --> 00:05:03,040
I was led to believe that Seattle was Tacoma's bitter enemy, so I'm so happy that you could

44
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:09,040
celebrate them. It's hard to keep the energy up. We don't have pyrotechnics or anything,

45
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:13,600
so we have been sort of obsessed with this audio file that we found.

46
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:18,000
It's not the best. We wouldn't do that. Not the best. Because we love you, damn it.

47
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:23,680
It's not the best. It's 45 minutes of Paul Stanley stage banter.

48
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:25,760
You know Paul Stanley from Kiss? From Kiss.

49
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:31,520
He's the one with the star. Yeah. So rather than us try to keep the energy

50
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:35,920
up and get everybody really excited, we thought we'd just let Paul Stanley do it.

51
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:41,040
For 45 whole minutes. Welcome to the fucking dungeon.

52
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:45,360
Not real. It's not real Paul Stanley. He couldn't make it, but we do have this audio file.

53
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:47,040
He sends his regrets. Yeah.

54
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:53,760
Just one thing you should, for the next couple of minutes, you should pretend you're in Toronto.

55
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:56,000
That will really help. It'll really hide the effect.

56
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:01,920
Also pretend like you're playing the Legend of Zelda Ocarina of Time and Navi is floating

57
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:04,960
over your shoulder for reasons that will become instantly apparent.

58
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:08,560
Also pretend like you know anything about the titles of Kiss songs.

59
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:10,240
Yeah. So you know what he's building up to.

60
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:13,680
He's going to be building up to some things that you're not going to be aware of where he's headed.

61
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:15,600
So just sort of hang in there. All right.

62
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:18,880
So let this just absorb this and let it get you so psyched.

63
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:23,200
This is 45 minutes of Paul Stan- Well, two minutes of Paul Stanley stage.

64
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:24,960
Two minutes of 45 minutes of Paul Stanley.

65
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:35,360
All right! Toronto! You feel good! All right then, listen.

66
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:39,920
You know, we may be under clear blue skies, but you know, it's getting a little

67
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:43,680
cool out tonight, but that ain't going to stop us because if we try hard enough,

68
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:48,880
we're going to get this place. I said we're going to get this place.

69
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:51,280
How did that help?

70
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:56,720
Can we get it a little louder? All right, listen.

71
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:01,120
I want to know if we got any people here tonight that like to get high.

72
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:06,640
You got any people tonight that are high?

73
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:12,000
All right then, listen.

74
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:17,840
You know, every once in a while, we like to get a little wasted.

75
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:20,240
We like to take a taste of alcohol.

76
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:29,040
And I tell you, when we won't get going, we ain't going to be drinking no Southern Comfort.

77
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:36,240
No, no. No, we ain't going to be drinking no tequila.

78
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:47,200
Because I tell you, when we won't get going, you know there's only one drink that gets us moving.

79
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:52,640
There's probably people who want the alcohol. He's building to it.

80
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:59,360
I can't hear you. All right, Toronto.

81
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:10,080
Listen, listen. You know, it wasn't too long ago we was here and I'll tell you,

82
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:14,000
every time we come here, damn it, it just gets better and better.

83
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:17,360
You people are dynamite.

84
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:19,520
That's it.

85
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:23,120
It goes on like that for another 43 minutes.

86
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:26,800
And we've listened to that like five times in the last 48 hours.

87
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:29,280
Listen! Listen! Toronto!

88
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:33,440
You gotta get the Daeku nut and throw it at stuff.

89
00:08:36,160 --> 00:08:39,360
Does anybody know what fucking alcohol song he's building to?

90
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:44,800
Old gin? Old gin? Wolf gin?

91
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:46,480
I get drunk on old gin.

92
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:49,040
It's really gross. Listen!

93
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:52,320
I like the way the dust particles settle in it.

94
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:55,040
You gotta find the master sword.

95
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:56,080
Toronto!

96
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:57,040
Toronto!

97
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:58,560
Give it a try for us.

98
00:08:58,560 --> 00:08:59,600
Hey, let's do a podcast.

99
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:05,680
You can't just play 45 minutes of Paul Stanley audio and call it a podcast.

100
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:07,840
Or can you? Hello, PodCon.

101
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:11,280
My new podcast, uh, so thank you to Paul.

102
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:14,480
Stand'em. That's what I would call it.

103
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:15,280
Yeah, it's not bad.

104
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:18,320
Yeah, it's not bad. It's not a good reaction, though.

105
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:21,840
We take your questions and turn them alchemy-like into wisdom.

106
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:24,240
And so, thank you.

107
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:26,080
So we're gonna do that now.

108
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:28,560
Lights are so bright. They're very bright lights.

109
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:29,040
So bright.

110
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:30,800
Hey, let's take it down. No, don't take it down.

111
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:31,840
I like it.

112
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:34,640
I am traveling from Salt Lake to Seattle,

113
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:38,560
and I'm wondering how the heck I'm supposed to take my skateboard on an airplane.

114
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:41,600
I have no idea.

115
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:45,440
And I don't want to leave it behind because it is my main form of transportation.

116
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:48,800
That's from skater boy on the salt dare.

117
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:51,920
At that point, isn't, isn't the airplane your...

118
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:56,160
No, he's skitching, skitching the whole way here.

119
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:58,160
Please watch out for the jets.

120
00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:00,240
They are not conducive to skitching.

121
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:04,880
I mean, you got a skateboard onto the tarmac.

122
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:05,600
Absolutely.

123
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:08,960
Up the luggage thing, onto the wing,

124
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:11,040
transfer over the chassis of the plane.

125
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:12,000
Into jail.

126
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,920
Into jail, out of jail, back onto the wing,

127
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:17,840
smash through the window of the airplane.

128
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:20,320
The flight will be grounded.

129
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:23,360
They need that window so bad.

130
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:25,440
It's important for the vacuum.

131
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:28,320
The vacuum. I don't understand much about airplane technology,

132
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:30,080
but I think the vacuum is quite important.

133
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:35,440
I have seen people bring, like, really weird shit on an airplane.

134
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:36,000
Yes.

135
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,800
Can't you just, can't you just bring...

136
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:39,360
Yeah, it's not...

137
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:41,360
It's so funny.

138
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:45,280
It's a very funny thing to say, Travis.

139
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:48,240
Is this your first episode of My Brother, My Brother, and Me?

140
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:51,440
So...

141
00:10:55,520 --> 00:10:56,960
The hard part is TSA.

142
00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:00,400
Cause they're going to be like, do you have anything dangerous?

143
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:02,880
And you're going to be like, I should fucking say I do.

144
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:04,320
I should fucking say I do.

145
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:09,040
Do you have any paper you need shredded?

146
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:11,520
And then you do a flip.

147
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:14,400
You do a kickflip and then you shred somebody's passport

148
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:17,200
with how hard your kickflip is.

149
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:18,960
They say, do you have anything electric in there?

150
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:20,320
Yeah, I guess.

151
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:21,040
Yeah, it is.

152
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:22,480
It is electrifying.

153
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:23,040
Oh, okay.

154
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:24,320
You have any liquids?

155
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:24,720
Yes.

156
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:28,480
The piss you're going to piss when you see me do my cool skateboard tricks.

157
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:31,280
If you get your, it's not conventional or cheap,

158
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:34,320
but if you get your passport printed on a skateboard,

159
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:39,360
they are going to have to let you board with it.

160
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:42,720
Or get your passport photo taken with your skateboard in it.

161
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:45,200
And so you show up, you're there, you're looking at your ticket.

162
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:45,920
They're like, this isn't you.

163
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:46,960
And you're like, oh, hold on.

164
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:51,600
Here's what you're going to have to do.

165
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:55,040
You could wear it as a hat in the passport photo and be like,

166
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:57,040
no, it's a medicinal skateboard.

167
00:11:57,040 --> 00:11:58,800
It's a medicinal skateboard hat.

168
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:00,800
I need it for life.

169
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:04,160
You're going to have to break your skateboard down into its component parts

170
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:06,720
and disguise them as other parts of your luggage.

171
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:09,600
Like use the wheels on your suitcase, right?

172
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:10,160
Yes.

173
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:13,120
And put the skateboard board,

174
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:17,600
the board part on the back of the suitcase,

175
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:19,920
and then put the trucks in the suitcase.

176
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:20,480
Trucks?

177
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:20,960
Trucks.

178
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:21,200
The?

179
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:22,480
Trucks, yeah.

180
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:23,200
Axles?

181
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:23,600
Yes.

182
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:24,800
I don't know.

183
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:27,280
I'm pretty in touch with skateboard culture.

184
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:31,680
I don't know how the security line at the TSA works,

185
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:35,040
but I think one of the main things they hate is components.

186
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:40,240
Any sort of component-based thing they're like not wild about.

187
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:41,920
Even if you promise them, no, no, no.

188
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:43,600
It's cool.

189
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:45,360
I'm going to build a skateboard.

190
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:48,160
I still don't think that's good.

191
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:49,440
I know how this looks.

192
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:51,920
I know how this looks, what with all the components,

193
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:54,080
but it is for a skateboard.

194
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:56,000
How about a Yahoo?

195
00:12:58,560 --> 00:12:59,920
If you've never listened to our show,

196
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:02,640
sometimes we make fun of people on Yahoo Answers.

197
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:03,280
No.

198
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:04,320
We make fun with them.

199
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:05,040
We make fun with them.

200
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:05,760
We help them out.

201
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:08,160
Are there any people who actually just show hands?

202
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:10,480
Any people who have never listened to our show before they're here?

203
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:11,280
Anybody?

204
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:12,320
Hey, all right.

205
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:12,800
All right.

206
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:14,000
All right.

207
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,360
Toronto.

208
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:16,560
New people.

209
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:20,320
Every time I come to podcast, it just gets better and better.

210
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:23,360
Better! You people are dynamite!

211
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:26,720
The podcast is not usually us shrieking Paul Stanley quotes.

212
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:31,360
This Yahoo is sent in by the delivery man himself, Seth Carlson.

213
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:31,600
Thank you.

214
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:36,960
It's Yahoo Answers user Carol who asks,

215
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:42,000
should spaghetti be way shorter?

216
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:47,280
I'm not talking about that macaroni.

217
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:49,040
I'm not talking about that penne.

218
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:52,400
I'm talking about that short spaghetti.

219
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:56,480
I really love word choice and Yahoo's is always my favorite part

220
00:13:56,480 --> 00:14:00,880
because the question is not, could spaghetti be shorter?

221
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:01,760
But should it?

222
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:02,400
Ethically.

223
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:04,160
Would it be okay?

224
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:06,960
Morally, is spaghetti too long?

225
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:10,880
I know a lot of times I'm sucking one of those good, good nudes up

226
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:11,760
and I get about-

227
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:12,320
Whoa!

228
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:13,200
And it's not a good-

229
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:14,080
No, okay.

230
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:15,040
Yikes!

231
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:17,520
In retrospect, it's not a good truncation.

232
00:14:17,520 --> 00:14:19,280
And we've all learned a lot here tonight.

233
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:21,840
Maybe dulls.

234
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:22,560
Dulls?

235
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:23,440
No, just noodles.

236
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:24,400
Dulls, noodles.

237
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:25,280
Noodles?

238
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:26,240
Noodles, noodles.

239
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:27,280
You know what I'll say?

240
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:28,320
Spaghetti noodles.

241
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:30,160
Sometimes I'm consuming a spaghetti noodle

242
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:33,120
and get two thirds of the way through and I'm like, ugh, I get it.

243
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:33,680
You're talking-

244
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:34,160
You're saying-

245
00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:35,840
Take a break.

246
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:40,880
Get to that point and I'm like, ugh, I'm over it.

247
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:41,840
You're saying that we need-

248
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:44,160
What if you get full at that exact moment?

249
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:44,400
Oh, yeah.

250
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:48,160
Yeah, I don't want the last third of this noodle.

251
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:49,200
Too much.

252
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:50,320
Too much for me.

253
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:53,120
You're saying way shorter is way too short.

254
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:56,400
You want a master's finesse on these noodles.

255
00:14:56,400 --> 00:15:00,480
A keen eye taking maybe 8% of the noodle off just a little-

256
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:02,240
I would like bespoke noodles.

257
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:02,800
Yes.

258
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:05,600
I would like someone who measures the inside of my mouth

259
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:07,840
and then makes noodles accordingly.

260
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:10,640
I want someone, I want a waiter to come to my table

261
00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:12,640
with what appears to be a mop

262
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:14,800
full of spaghettis of varying lengths

263
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:18,480
and then ask me very personal questions about my upbringing.

264
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:20,480
Select the right noodle.

265
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:23,360
Measure your mouth with a special ruler.

266
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:25,840
And then maybe come around with a golden pair of scissors

267
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:28,160
that they discard immediately after you-

268
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:28,960
Throw it right away.

269
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:30,720
And it's just like, that's too much noodle.

270
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:31,760
And they just take care of it-

271
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:33,840
Ooh, they could cut it right in front of your mouth.

272
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:34,720
Right in front of your mouth.

273
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:36,560
You're going like, that's it, win.

274
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:38,160
Yes, of course, sir.

275
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:42,160
Thank you, sir. Okay, what if they just come to the table

276
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:45,200
with a bathtub full of spaghetti

277
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:48,480
and they stand there and just let you keep sucking it up

278
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:50,000
until you're full and then-

279
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,520
And hidden inside is a flag.

280
00:15:57,520 --> 00:15:59,360
You're going to space camp, my friend.

281
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:02,800
I feel like if spaghetti was way shorter,

282
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:04,800
you would have fork issues.

283
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:06,720
This would now become a spoon food.

284
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:07,200
Yeah.

285
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:08,960
Well, not only that, how unsatisfying would it be

286
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:09,440
if you were like-

287
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:13,760
You like the noodly hanging,

288
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:16,080
the Cthulhu effect of the noodles.

289
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:19,520
There's a certain sound wave that happens

290
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:21,040
as you inhale the noodle.

291
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:21,440
That's like-

292
00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:23,120
Right, that's one of my-

293
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:24,720
Yeah, also my vape noise.

294
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:28,480
Is there spaghetti flavored vape?

295
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:28,960
Yep.

296
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:32,160
If we're going to make them shorter,

297
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:34,320
we should probably make them thicker as well.

298
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:35,840
Oh, God.

299
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:36,800
I want-

300
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:38,080
How thick are we talking?

301
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:39,680
What's the diameter juice?

302
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:45,120
Like baked bean can size spaghetti noodles

303
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:48,720
that are about this long and this big around.

304
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:50,000
I want it to be like,

305
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,480
man, I want some spaghetti in four hours.

306
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:53,920
I better start braising this.

307
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:59,680
So like a puck of spaghetti.

308
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:00,400
Exactly.

309
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:01,520
How do you want it?

310
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:02,880
It only comes al dente.

311
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:06,000
It can't get very cooked.

312
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,680
That's great. You can just lay it on its side

313
00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:10,720
and just take a big bite of it from the top.

314
00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:11,680
I like-

315
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:12,640
You're laughing,

316
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:14,560
but there's a dark part of you-

317
00:17:14,560 --> 00:17:15,360
You would.

318
00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:15,680
You do.

319
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:16,640
You, you.

320
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:17,520
There's a part of you that's like,

321
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:19,120
put a sear on it, maybe.

322
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:19,600
I don't know.

323
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:22,080
I need a nasty noodle can.

324
00:17:22,080 --> 00:17:23,680
Yeah, I eat a nasty can of noodle.

325
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:25,680
Where does the sauce go?

326
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:26,880
It's just sauce flavored.

327
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:27,440
If you put it-

328
00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:28,160
Oh, God.

329
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:31,360
This is not a food of opulence.

330
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:33,440
This is a food of convenience that's for you.

331
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:34,800
It's obviously inside.

332
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:36,160
Oh.

333
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:37,760
Yeah, like a secret pocket.

334
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:39,360
If you cut it, it just sort of-

335
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:40,160
Oh, gotta be careful now,

336
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:42,320
because now we're talking about a big ravioli.

337
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:42,880
No, no, no.

338
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:44,800
Holy shit.

339
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:46,080
No.

340
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:47,520
It's all connected.

341
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:47,760
Okay.

342
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:50,480
All pastas, kind of the same, yeah.

343
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:51,920
Okay, time out, time out.

344
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:55,120
Quick ravioli check, if anybody's ever-

345
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:56,800
Anyone here a ravioli?

346
00:17:56,800 --> 00:17:59,120
You have to tell us there's entrapment.

347
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:02,320
You, you know that classically,

348
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:06,080
this, the marinara is not stuffed inside the ravioli.

349
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:07,120
Like a gusher.

350
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:09,200
Like a savory marinara gusher.

351
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:10,080
It's not like that.

352
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:12,240
Oh, no, that's a pizza roll.

353
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:14,080
Okay, fair.

354
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:16,240
Why have they never made savory gushers,

355
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:17,840
now that I'm thinking about it?

356
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:21,520
Fucking cowards, all of you.

357
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:23,440
Here's what it should be.

358
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:25,120
It should be a packet of gushers.

359
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:27,280
99% of them are sweet.

360
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:29,440
One is savory.

361
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:30,400
I gotta be careful though,

362
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:33,040
I don't want my head to turn into a big ravioli,

363
00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:35,840
like the commercials for gushers.

364
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:41,440
So, recently at my parents' house,

365
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:44,880
I found an old trunk full of the bram with dusty puppets.

366
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:47,200
Hello, we're the dusty puppets!

367
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:48,720
Hello, Toronto!

368
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:49,920
Hello, Toronto!

369
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:54,480
I also found proof that my father was involved

370
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,680
in competitive puppetry.

371
00:18:57,680 --> 00:18:59,200
Okay, hold on.

372
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:04,400
You find a trunk of dusty puppets,

373
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:05,920
that speaks for itself.

374
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:07,760
Oh, my father used puppets.

375
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:10,800
What is the proof that your dad used to do competitive-

376
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:11,760
Articles.

377
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:12,720
In clippings.

378
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:15,360
The only thing I think is a trophy for competitive puppetry.

379
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:15,920
A medal.

380
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:18,560
No, a local teen competes with puppets.

381
00:19:18,560 --> 00:19:19,040
Yeah.

382
00:19:19,040 --> 00:19:23,040
This could have been something we talked about as a family before,

383
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:24,480
and maybe I just forgot.

384
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:24,960
No.

385
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:26,240
You would not have forgotten.

386
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:28,080
No, you would not have forgotten.

387
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:29,760
Absolutely not.

388
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:32,480
I feel like I would have remembered puppets.

389
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:32,880
Yep.

390
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:35,600
Either way, this cannot go unaddressed.

391
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:39,520
When is the best time to bring up that you know about your father's secret past

392
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:41,040
as a competitive puppeteer?

393
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:44,960
That's from quote, I know about the puppets in Paris.

394
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:46,720
Okay, I would like to pose the scenario.

395
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:48,320
Justin is the dad here, okay?

396
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:53,760
Okay.

397
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:57,040
I don't think you want to do that.

398
00:19:57,040 --> 00:20:00,960
His father's a strong man, and he put the puppets away for a reason.

399
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:04,000
I'm not ready for whatever kind of reaction he's going to have.

400
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:04,640
Like a cobra.

401
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:06,960
He competes at a professional level.

402
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:07,600
Yeah.

403
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:09,120
What is a puppet competent-

404
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:11,920
Can we address what competitive puppetry is?

405
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:13,360
Okay, options.

406
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:18,400
One, you're trying to knock off the other guy's puppet.

407
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:20,000
With your puppet or a pre-made?

408
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,200
My puppeting's so hard.

409
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:25,200
It is non-contact competitive puppeteering.

410
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:29,200
You scare them very bad with your good-

411
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:30,240
Yeah.

412
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:31,200
Okay, option two.

413
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:36,320
How long can you puppet before someone realizes it's not a real person?

414
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:38,160
That's it.

415
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:39,840
Start the clock.

416
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:40,240
Because when-

417
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:41,520
Hi, everybody.

418
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:42,480
Hey, Steve.

419
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:44,320
How's it going? Just another hard day-

420
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:45,200
Wait a minute.

421
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:45,920
Stop the clock.

422
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:48,000
This guy's felt.

423
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:50,640
He's got googly eyes.

424
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:52,640
When Sesame Street came out, nobody knew.

425
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:55,360
And so reviews of the first episode of Sesame Street was like,

426
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:57,760
they have the biggest bird I've ever fucking seen.

427
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:00,160
It talks at everything.

428
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:04,880
They found a real fucking cryptozoological monster, and it loves cookies.

429
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:06,240
10 out of 10 stars.

430
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:07,760
Put it on PBS, Darla.

431
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:10,480
There's a giant hairy elephant, and it's talking.

432
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:11,680
He's in a trashcan.

433
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:13,200
I don't even know what's up.

434
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:15,760
My one-year-old son loves Sesame Street, though.

435
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:17,600
That's probably really what it's like for him.

436
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:20,480
That must be nice.

437
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:22,480
Love to go back to imagine.

438
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:23,520
Love to go back.

439
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:26,400
To have an imagination again.

440
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:28,880
To believe in hope and goodness.

441
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:30,320
Competitive puppeteering.

442
00:21:32,560 --> 00:21:34,240
Competitive puppetry of the penis.

443
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:35,120
Is that anything?

444
00:21:36,560 --> 00:21:38,000
I don't want it to be a thing.

445
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:38,720
Is that just like,

446
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:40,640
I don't want it to be a thing.

447
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:41,360
Is that just like,

448
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:41,840
Yeah.

449
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:45,680
Puppetry of the penis does exist.

450
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:47,440
That's not from my mind's eye.

451
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:50,320
It was on Showtime late at night when I was a teenager.

452
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:55,920
Maybe, maybe, maybe, maybe I'm competitive.

453
00:21:55,920 --> 00:21:57,280
Puppetry of the penis.

454
00:21:57,280 --> 00:22:00,160
You're using your competitor's penis.

455
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:01,920
Yes, absolutely.

456
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:03,680
That's a short match.

457
00:22:03,680 --> 00:22:04,880
Yes, I give.

458
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:06,000
Mercy, mercy, mercy.

459
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:06,480
I quit.

460
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:08,320
All right, and we're ready to say, I'm done.

461
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:09,280
I'm out.

462
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:10,080
How about a yahoo?

463
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:11,600
I have another one.

464
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:12,000
Wait, hold on.

465
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,840
I think I know what competitive puppetry is.

466
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:15,040
Oh, good.

467
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:18,080
Two puppeteers, the same puppet.

468
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:21,120
And they take turns and it's like,

469
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:22,720
no, that was, that was what that puppet is.

470
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:24,880
I thought you meant two hands, one puppet.

471
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:32,400
And I'm not going to make the cheap joke

472
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:34,320
that sounds like two hands, one puppet.

473
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:37,600
Cause that's below us and it's fucking 2017 AD.

474
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:40,240
The year of our Lord on the Gregorian calendar.

475
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:40,800
Stop it.

476
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:44,160
This is from the delivery man, Seth Carlson again.

477
00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:44,720
Thank you, Seth.

478
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:48,240
It's yahoo answers user, the DS guy who asks,

479
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:51,040
is a jelly donut a donut?

480
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:59,840
Now listen, you think you know where this question is going.

481
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:03,200
I mentioned the donut man to my Sunday school teacher.

482
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:05,280
So he played his guitar and sang a song.

483
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:07,920
Life without Jesus is like a donut because there's

484
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:09,440
a hole in the middle of your heart.

485
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,360
Everyone loves this jam.

486
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:13,280
You guys know that one, right?

487
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:17,440
I said, what about donuts without holes?

488
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:20,720
He played and sang the same song, but with different lyrics.

489
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:22,960
A donut without a hole is not a donut.

490
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:27,520
So I said, what about a jelly donut?

491
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:29,680
He sang the same song with the lyrics.

492
00:23:29,680 --> 00:23:35,360
A jelly donut is not a donut.

493
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:36,400
So is he right?

494
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:37,920
Is a jelly donut, not a donut?

495
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:39,840
Is a donut without a hole, not a donut?

496
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:41,680
Is a life without Jesus like a donut?

497
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:43,360
Is there a hole in the middle of your heart?

498
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:44,800
Jesus wants to fill that hole.

499
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:54,000
My favorite mental picture of this is the progression

500
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:57,760
of the Sunday school teacher whose face plays the first song.

501
00:23:57,760 --> 00:24:00,400
But what about a donut without a donut hole?

502
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:02,080
Well, that's ridiculous.

503
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:03,440
Okay, second song.

504
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:04,960
And then third, what about a jelly donut?

505
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:09,120
Jelly donut is not a donut.

506
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:14,960
The, this Sunday school teacher looked in the mirror that morning

507
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:16,800
before class and said to himself,

508
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:19,920
I am out of things I know about Jesus.

509
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:26,000
I have a Sunday school class today and I've taught them

510
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:29,520
all the cool things that I learned about Jesus.

511
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:33,120
All his wanderings and his ways, I have taught them all.

512
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:34,960
I should try to vamp.

513
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:38,640
I hope someone asks the question that allows me to vamp off of it.

514
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:39,520
But here's the thing.

515
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:43,520
If you tell a six-year-old that life without Jesus is like a donut,

516
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:45,200
how's that six-year-old not like sweet?

517
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:45,840
Awesome.

518
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:46,320
Yeah.

519
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:47,600
Fucking sick, bro.

520
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:48,400
I love donuts.

521
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:49,440
Donuts are awesome.

522
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:51,440
If I remember correctly, the song is literally like,

523
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:54,240
it's good for a little while, but then like-

524
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:54,720
No.

525
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:57,840
Then you hit the center where there's no more donuts.

526
00:24:57,840 --> 00:24:59,200
That's not how donuts work.

527
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:00,480
I've never eaten a donut and be like,

528
00:25:01,280 --> 00:25:02,320
hey, where'd it go?

529
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:04,240
What the hell?

530
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:07,840
Why did you do this to me, Jesus?

531
00:25:09,680 --> 00:25:11,760
There's no donut in the middle of the donut.

532
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:16,320
Do you think that anybody tried to tell that cat like,

533
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:19,280
I know you think you have something with this track,

534
00:25:19,280 --> 00:25:22,560
but that sounds pretty rad.

535
00:25:22,560 --> 00:25:25,200
I don't think we necessarily want to compare these two things.

536
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:27,520
Also, long johns are donuts.

537
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:28,560
They don't have holes.

538
00:25:28,560 --> 00:25:29,920
Is a Danish a donut?

539
00:25:29,920 --> 00:25:31,360
No, it's a Danish, stupid.

540
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:33,120
Now wait.

541
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:34,160
Okay.

542
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:37,200
Is a jelly donut just a Danish?

543
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:40,560
Jelly donut's just a closed over Danish that hasn't been circumcised.

544
00:25:43,920 --> 00:25:44,320
Okay.

545
00:25:47,280 --> 00:25:48,640
Well, think about it.

546
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:49,520
I'd rather not.

547
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:51,280
No, I get it.

548
00:25:51,280 --> 00:25:52,560
You brisk that jelly donut.

549
00:25:52,560 --> 00:25:54,400
Now we're working Danish territory.

550
00:25:55,680 --> 00:25:56,640
We're in Denmark.

551
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:02,160
No, hold on.

552
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:03,280
Justin's moved the mic.

553
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:04,960
Oh, shit.

554
00:26:07,920 --> 00:26:08,640
Wait, hold on.

555
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:24,560
The people who raised their hands just looked around so confused.

556
00:26:24,560 --> 00:26:31,440
I come from the land of the ice and snow.

557
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:39,440
This is a very, very litigious band.

558
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:40,880
I want a munch.

559
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:49,200
Hey, everybody.

560
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:50,160
Welcome to Munch Squad.

561
00:26:50,160 --> 00:26:54,480
It's a podcast within a podcast.

562
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:59,120
We're so honored to be at PodCon when the McElroy brothers got the invite.

563
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:01,120
We didn't know if we would also be on the list,

564
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:06,080
but we begged and pleaded our way in and we're so excited to be with you to share this.

565
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:09,040
I can see not very well Justin's iPad from this side of the table.

566
00:27:09,040 --> 00:27:13,840
I just saw sort of a brown sort of mass that maybe is sort of...

567
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:15,360
Don't give it away.

568
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:15,680
Okay.

569
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:19,120
Big news, everyone.

570
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:22,480
Cinnabon against God.

571
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:25,600
It doesn't say that.

572
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:27,280
That's me editorializing.

573
00:27:27,280 --> 00:27:28,480
S-I-N-A-B-U-N.

574
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:28,720
Yeah.

575
00:27:29,680 --> 00:27:30,080
Thank you.

576
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:30,560
Thank you.

577
00:27:30,560 --> 00:27:33,600
Cinnabon is stuffing a cinnamon roll inside a cookie.

578
00:27:36,560 --> 00:27:36,880
Wait.

579
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:39,520
There's no space inside a cookie.

580
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:42,000
Unless this cookie is the fucking TARDIS.

581
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,400
I do not understand how this feat is possible.

582
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:46,320
It's spreading a cinnamon bun.

583
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:47,200
Cinnamon roll.

584
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:48,000
Wait, what?

585
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:48,880
Cinema bun.

586
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:49,760
Cinema bun.

587
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:50,800
A cinema bun.

588
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:52,720
Cinema bun inside a cookie.

589
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:56,640
They're taking a cookie and they're putting a fucking cinnamon roll inside of it.

590
00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:58,720
That should be the end of the press release.

591
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:05,120
My favorite thing about Munch Squad is that sometimes in order to justify...

592
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:06,080
I'll just say it.

593
00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:06,720
Their sin.

594
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:12,400
They come up with a fake situation that they're solving.

595
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:15,200
Like, no, you see, it's not a sin against Jesus.

596
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:17,680
We're solving a problem.

597
00:28:17,680 --> 00:28:20,960
And the fake problem they've invented for this delight...

598
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:22,480
Not enough diabetes.

599
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:23,600
Yeah, right.

600
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:25,440
Is one of my favorites so far.

601
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:28,480
The days of deciding between a fresh warm cookie

602
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:31,680
and an ooey gooey Cinnabon cinnamon roll are no more.

603
00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:36,560
These are two different day periods that you eat these foods.

604
00:28:36,560 --> 00:28:40,560
Also, who made both of them at the same time?

605
00:28:41,040 --> 00:28:43,120
Who was like looking at the oven like, what's this?

606
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:44,320
Oh, we fucked up.

607
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:45,760
We did two bakings.

608
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:50,880
In honor of National Cookie Day, Cinnabon will...

609
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:54,000
I mean, desecrate the idea of a cookie.

610
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,880
It'll slit its throat in front of its family.

611
00:28:57,520 --> 00:29:01,040
Cinnabon will offer the most ingenious treat to date.

612
00:29:01,040 --> 00:29:02,080
The Cookie Bond Bite.

613
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:07,360
This item takes the beloved chocolate chip cookie to another level.

614
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:08,480
Hell, pretty bad.

615
00:29:09,920 --> 00:29:11,920
By baking a Bond Bite...

616
00:29:11,920 --> 00:29:13,440
Imagine the, like...

617
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:14,880
Pretend you're the person creating this

618
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:16,880
and see if your brain doesn't try to stop you.

619
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:17,600
It probably will.

620
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:19,760
It takes the Bond Bite,

621
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:22,560
the bite-sized version of Cinnabon's world famous cinnamon roll,

622
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:24,400
inside a chocolate chip cookie.

623
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:26,000
Where?

624
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:26,960
Where?

625
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:28,480
Where?

626
00:29:29,040 --> 00:29:31,600
It will only be available for a limited time,

627
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:33,840
as will the people who consume it, ironically.

628
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:40,400
There's no better way to celebrate National Cookie Day

629
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:42,880
than with the quintessential combination of cookies and milk.

630
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:44,960
Stop acting like you're fucking honoring the cookie

631
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:47,040
when you're remixing it and shitting on it.

632
00:29:47,040 --> 00:29:50,640
There's no better way to celebrate your last National Cookie Day.

633
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:51,600
Huh.

634
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:55,200
To provide guests with the ultimate dunking experience.

635
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:57,280
Who dumps a fucking cinnamon roll?

636
00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:01,440
They partnered with Fair Life

637
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:04,160
to provide a free eight ounce bottle of milk.

638
00:30:04,160 --> 00:30:07,520
Your last one for every Cookie Bite purchase on December 4th.

639
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:09,280
And we put cookies in it.

640
00:30:09,280 --> 00:30:10,080
Fuck off.

641
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:10,880
Fuck off.

642
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:15,200
The nutrient-rich ultra-filtered milk is lactose-free.

643
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:18,320
It contains 50% more protein, 30% more calcium.

644
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:18,880
I am.

645
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:21,600
Wait, and 50% less sugar than regular milk.

646
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:26,800
Do not care about the nutrients in the milk of the Nightmare Bomb

647
00:30:26,800 --> 00:30:29,440
that I'm shoving down my hate gullet.

648
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:32,640
That's the worst misdirect I've ever heard.

649
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:35,440
But the milk is so wicked good for y'all.

650
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:36,000
Seriously.

651
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:39,600
The milk's totally gonna cover for the sugar mess.

652
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:41,120
The milk's like, not fine.

653
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:41,840
He's with me.

654
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:48,160
The bad cookie will hide in the milk in your tummy.

655
00:30:48,160 --> 00:30:50,400
Um, there's more.

656
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:52,960
Sharing a passion for the highest quality ingredients yield...

657
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:57,040
I don't care if this shit's made out of emeralds.

658
00:30:58,480 --> 00:30:59,120
And gold leaf.

659
00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:02,480
Cinnabon and Fair Life make the perfect pair, just like Milky Cookies.

660
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:04,720
Let's check in with Jill Thomas,

661
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:07,520
the Vice President of Global Marketing for Cinnabon.

662
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:10,240
Free me from this prison.

663
00:31:11,040 --> 00:31:15,520
The Cookie Bomb Bite is one of our yummiest examples of creativity

664
00:31:15,520 --> 00:31:20,400
to come out of the Innovation Kitchen.

665
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:23,840
Hatred and creativity are different things, Jill.

666
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:26,560
But they occupy the same part of our awful brain.

667
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:31,440
The extent to which we despise humanity has never been more full-on.

668
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:33,040
We've never hurt you more.

669
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:39,280
The delicious Cookie Bomb Bite joins two extraordinary baked goods

670
00:31:39,280 --> 00:31:46,160
to create an unexpected out-of-this-world flavor combination not to be missed.

671
00:31:46,160 --> 00:31:46,660
How?

672
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:49,440
Because here's the thing.

673
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:50,960
Show me a picture of this bad boy.

674
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:52,800
All I'm picturing is like Saturn,

675
00:31:52,800 --> 00:31:55,600
where there's literally just like a salmon bun thing.

676
00:31:55,600 --> 00:31:57,040
You're not that far off, my man.

677
00:31:57,040 --> 00:31:58,000
I don't know if y'all...

678
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:58,800
Probably not, right?

679
00:31:58,800 --> 00:32:00,000
But I can try to...

680
00:32:05,040 --> 00:32:05,920
Somebody...

681
00:32:05,920 --> 00:32:07,280
Yeah, I mean, I need it too.

682
00:32:07,280 --> 00:32:08,720
That's what you're all fucking thinking.

683
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:11,120
You wanted to laugh, but like secretly you're like,

684
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:13,440
hell yeah, I fucked that up.

685
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:14,320
No question.

686
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:15,360
I just, it's...

687
00:32:16,160 --> 00:32:18,240
Do you think after they put this press release out,

688
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:19,600
somebody leaned in and like,

689
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:22,480
why didn't we just do like a chocolate chip cinnamon roll?

690
00:32:23,040 --> 00:32:24,640
And they're like, oh, shit.

691
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:26,320
Damn it.

692
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:29,760
That's because they were getting into their partnership

693
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:32,560
with Nashville's Christie Cookie Company,

694
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:36,560
the brand behind the famous DoubleTree by Hilton Cookie.

695
00:32:36,560 --> 00:32:39,280
We take your favorite hotel cookie and we put it

696
00:32:39,280 --> 00:32:40,400
in a fucking cinnamon roll.

697
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:41,120
What do we care?

698
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:43,280
We take your favorite hotel cookie,

699
00:32:43,280 --> 00:32:45,520
put it in your favorite airport cinnamon roll.

700
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:49,200
Our partnership with Christie Cookie Company

701
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:51,440
is just one example of our dedication

702
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:53,600
to supporting premium bakery brands

703
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:56,880
that offer craveable products on par with Cinnabon.

704
00:32:56,880 --> 00:32:58,240
Are you sure you want to do that, Jill?

705
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:01,440
You sure you want to wash the throne that hard?

706
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:06,480
There is one kind of day you can have after eating one of these,

707
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:07,040
I feel like.

708
00:33:07,040 --> 00:33:09,600
In a way, like maybe it's a relief you eat one of these

709
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:13,040
and it's like, well, clear my schedule.

710
00:33:13,040 --> 00:33:16,320
Yeah, it transforms your khakis into sweats.

711
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:19,280
This is a cookie you look at all day and think, not yet.

712
00:33:19,280 --> 00:33:20,000
Not yet.

713
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:20,480
Not yet.

714
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:20,800
Not yet.

715
00:33:20,800 --> 00:33:21,120
Not yet.

716
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:23,680
I still have things to do in this world.

717
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:26,640
How about another question?

718
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:27,140
Yup.

719
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:29,520
I work at a bridal store.

720
00:33:29,520 --> 00:33:30,000
Oops.

721
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:30,560
Oh, no.

722
00:33:30,560 --> 00:33:31,760
Oh, no.

723
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:32,720
Questions went away.

724
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:34,240
I work at a bridal store and have

725
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:35,920
to work in pretty close proximity

726
00:33:35,920 --> 00:33:37,280
to a lot of our customers.

727
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:40,160
When I notice that someone smells particularly nice,

728
00:33:40,160 --> 00:33:41,520
it's such a pleasant surprise.

729
00:33:41,520 --> 00:33:43,360
I often find myself complimenting them on it.

730
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:49,120
It's too late.

731
00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:49,920
It's too late for them.

732
00:33:49,920 --> 00:33:50,720
Next question.

733
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:51,220
Move on.

734
00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:52,400
They're done.

735
00:33:52,400 --> 00:33:53,760
They fucked up too bad.

736
00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:56,720
The problem is saying, wow, you smell really good.

737
00:33:57,440 --> 00:34:00,240
Sometimes comes off the wrong way.

738
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:00,960
Are you sure?

739
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:01,460
What?

740
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:03,920
Go on.

741
00:34:03,920 --> 00:34:06,880
However, I think saying sorry I'm not trying to be creepy

742
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:08,400
might actually make it worse.

743
00:34:08,400 --> 00:34:08,900
Yes.

744
00:34:09,840 --> 00:34:10,880
Oh, you don't say.

745
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:12,880
Both are right.

746
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:16,720
Should I stop complimenting this aspect of my customers completely

747
00:34:16,720 --> 00:34:18,640
or just stop apologizing for it?

748
00:34:18,640 --> 00:34:21,360
That's from Sorry for Smelling in Nebraska.

749
00:34:22,400 --> 00:34:23,280
Are you here?

750
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:24,880
I heard so much response.

751
00:34:26,080 --> 00:34:26,800
Yes or no?

752
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:28,880
And I'll count it down.

753
00:34:28,880 --> 00:34:30,640
Is this acceptable behavior?

754
00:34:30,640 --> 00:34:31,600
Yes or no?

755
00:34:31,600 --> 00:34:32,720
Three, two, one.

756
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:35,920
So I heard a lot of yes there.

757
00:34:35,920 --> 00:34:37,200
I heard six yeses.

758
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:38,960
Travis's challenge accepted.

759
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:41,200
We're going to do round robin and try to say this in a way

760
00:34:41,200 --> 00:34:41,840
that isn't creepy.

761
00:34:41,840 --> 00:34:42,720
No, no, no.

762
00:34:42,720 --> 00:34:43,200
We can do that.

763
00:34:43,200 --> 00:34:43,680
We can do that.

764
00:34:43,680 --> 00:34:47,040
People edit it out and make it sound like a thing, I think.

765
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:49,200
Some of us have acting degrees.

766
00:34:49,200 --> 00:34:49,700
Okay.

767
00:34:50,640 --> 00:34:52,960
Justin has three quarters of an acting degree.

768
00:34:53,600 --> 00:34:55,200
I have a whole acting degree.

769
00:34:55,200 --> 00:34:59,760
All right, here we go.

770
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:01,680
That was just me clearing my throat.

771
00:35:04,240 --> 00:35:05,440
I gotta let him get through it.

772
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:06,480
Just let me get to it.

773
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:06,980
Yeah.

774
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:09,680
Your musk.

775
00:35:09,680 --> 00:35:10,180
Okay.

776
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:11,680
No, okay.

777
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:12,960
Gotta let him get through it.

778
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:13,760
Gotta let me get through it.

779
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:15,600
Because you don't know how it's gonna end.

780
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:19,360
The fragrance you're exuding.

781
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:20,560
Right?

782
00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:21,680
No, I'm out.

783
00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:22,240
I quit.

784
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:22,880
I'm tapping out.

785
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:24,240
I'm out.

786
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:25,520
Okay, everybody be quiet.

787
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:30,400
No.

788
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:31,120
No?

789
00:35:31,120 --> 00:35:32,320
Your smell.

790
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:33,840
No, can't start with a sniff.

791
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:34,720
Okay, let me try it.

792
00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:35,280
Let me try again.

793
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:35,440
Let me try.

794
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:36,000
Okay, okay, okay.

795
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:38,480
No.

796
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:39,520
Okay, no.

797
00:35:39,520 --> 00:35:40,320
Absolutely not.

798
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:40,800
Cannot.

799
00:35:41,360 --> 00:35:41,840
Griffin, do you wanna-

800
00:35:41,840 --> 00:35:42,800
Your particles.

801
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:43,300
All right.

802
00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:45,520
They smell good.

803
00:35:45,520 --> 00:35:46,000
You're done.

804
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:46,560
It's done.

805
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:48,720
What if you're just like...

806
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:52,800
Oh, nice.

807
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:55,440
No need to-

808
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:56,400
Okay, let's act it out.

809
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:56,960
Act it out.

810
00:35:56,960 --> 00:35:57,440
You do it.

811
00:35:57,440 --> 00:36:00,080
I'm leaning down to look at a veil that I like.

812
00:36:00,080 --> 00:36:00,580
Okay.

813
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:03,520
Oh, nice.

814
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:07,920
What if I don't do the sniff?

815
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:09,200
Okay, let's try again.

816
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:09,700
Okay.

817
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:12,000
Oh, nice.

818
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:12,720
What?

819
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:13,280
What's up?

820
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:17,680
There's a good smell in here from sniffing.

821
00:36:17,680 --> 00:36:19,120
There's a smell in here from somebody.

822
00:36:23,840 --> 00:36:26,000
Somebody in here smells good.

823
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:26,720
Live your life with-

824
00:36:26,720 --> 00:36:27,280
Not me.

825
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:28,080
Not me.

826
00:36:28,080 --> 00:36:29,600
Who else is it?

827
00:36:29,600 --> 00:36:30,480
Is it me?

828
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:31,520
I guess so.

829
00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:33,440
Or somebody else who was in here before.

830
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:34,880
That's not weird, is it?

831
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:35,840
I love you.

832
00:36:35,840 --> 00:36:37,040
I love you too.

833
00:36:37,040 --> 00:36:39,200
That dress is for our wedding now.

834
00:36:41,360 --> 00:36:42,800
I stole your fucking wedding.

835
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:48,160
Live your life with the confidence of the person willing to claim the good smell is them.

836
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:49,360
It's me.

837
00:36:49,360 --> 00:36:50,320
It's me.

838
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:50,960
You got it.

839
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:57,520
I know if you missed up before going outside, you know you're the one with the good smell.

840
00:36:57,520 --> 00:37:01,040
You always know if you're the one with the smell, no matter what kind of smell it is.

841
00:37:01,040 --> 00:37:02,320
Actually, here's the thing.

842
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:05,360
I live my life every day afraid that I smell bad and no one's telling me.

843
00:37:05,360 --> 00:37:06,640
That's just like, I leave her room out.

844
00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:07,280
Jesus.

845
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:08,000
I know.

846
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:09,520
I have a lot of weird anxiety.

847
00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:10,080
A lot.

848
00:37:10,080 --> 00:37:14,880
And so for someone to look at me and be like, hey, straight up, you smell good.

849
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:15,680
No.

850
00:37:15,680 --> 00:37:20,640
Still, you said that out loud and even then after you said it, you still realized it's not good.

851
00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:25,120
I think the only way that would actually work is if I traveled back in time to myself and said,

852
00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:27,040
hey, you smell good.

853
00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:33,280
There's no good way really to compliment a stranger about more or less anything, which is fine.

854
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:36,800
Maybe an anonymous comment card situation.

855
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:43,200
Everybody should have like a suggestion box that they carry like a fanny pack on their back though.

856
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:47,680
And so you slip it in there where they're not like, and it's like, totally cool.

857
00:37:47,680 --> 00:37:48,960
The smell is nice.

858
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:50,560
No, it's still not good.

859
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:53,280
What about a missed connections web page?

860
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:54,800
Still not good, Travis.

861
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:57,920
But then it just says like, you came into my store and you smell good.

862
00:37:57,920 --> 00:37:59,520
And then you'd be like, I think that was me.

863
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:02,000
Go to them and say, hey, what's your LinkedIn?

864
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:02,880
And they'll tell you.

865
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:03,840
You say, okay, good.

866
00:38:03,840 --> 00:38:05,120
You got a good reputation.

867
00:38:05,120 --> 00:38:10,240
Come in your way, keep an eye on, keep an eye on your inbox.

868
00:38:10,240 --> 00:38:14,480
What if there was just a sign over the door that says someone in here smells good?

869
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:22,240
Then he could just like point to, you could ask them what shampoo.

870
00:38:22,240 --> 00:38:24,640
Ooh, Ooh, Ooh, Ooh, Ooh.

871
00:38:24,640 --> 00:38:26,400
Nevermind I got two y'all.

872
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:26,880
All right.

873
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:27,440
I think I've got it.

874
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:28,000
I think I've got it.

875
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:29,520
Okay.

876
00:38:29,520 --> 00:38:33,440
They're trying on the dress or veil or whatever.

877
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:35,280
And you say, what's that smell?

878
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:38,240
No, no, I can't, you can't.

879
00:38:38,240 --> 00:38:40,480
Especially now when someone's changing clothes.

880
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:42,080
Yeah, can't, can't do it.

881
00:38:42,080 --> 00:38:44,960
You think they're going to be talking about a butt?

882
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:47,280
No, you can't.

883
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:51,040
What's that smell has never been followed with the rest of the sentence cause it's great.

884
00:38:51,040 --> 00:38:52,480
All right, stop, stop.

885
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:55,040
What's that good smell?

886
00:38:55,040 --> 00:38:58,640
No, no, what's that good smell is fucking bulletproof.

887
00:38:58,640 --> 00:39:00,320
You enlist them in the mystery.

888
00:39:00,320 --> 00:39:03,840
Let us live around together.

889
00:39:03,840 --> 00:39:07,040
And they might say, Oh, I have a scent on, it might be me.

890
00:39:07,040 --> 00:39:10,400
And then you can say like, Oh yeah, I guess that's it, done.

891
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:17,840
Don't need to drag it out any, what have you, what have you gained?

892
00:39:17,840 --> 00:39:19,360
What have you gained?

893
00:39:19,360 --> 00:39:23,200
This is why can't you smell the smell, think in your head, that's nice.

894
00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:26,080
And then store that positive moment away for yourself.

895
00:39:26,080 --> 00:39:27,840
Even that's kind of funny.

896
00:39:27,840 --> 00:39:37,360
I'm going to save, I'm not going to say anything, but I'm going to save the memory of your great

897
00:39:37,360 --> 00:39:39,360
smell for myself later.

898
00:39:39,360 --> 00:39:43,280
I'm going to enjoy it later.

899
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:48,560
I think maturity is just a series of starting to say really fucked up things and then thinking

900
00:39:48,560 --> 00:39:49,560
now it's just for me.

901
00:39:49,560 --> 00:39:50,560
Yeah, that one.

902
00:39:50,560 --> 00:39:53,320
That one's staying in the old dome.

903
00:39:53,320 --> 00:39:55,480
Or just not thinking them.

904
00:39:55,480 --> 00:40:01,360
Listen, I wish I had that kind of self control.

905
00:40:01,360 --> 00:40:09,840
Hey everybody, this is Griffin.

906
00:40:09,840 --> 00:40:13,760
Thank you so much for listening to this episode of My Brother and My Brother and Me, our live

907
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:15,560
show from PodCon.

908
00:40:15,560 --> 00:40:16,560
PodCon was a ton of fun.

909
00:40:16,560 --> 00:40:20,840
If you didn't get a chance to go to it, you missed out on seeing some really great panels

910
00:40:20,840 --> 00:40:22,520
or did you miss out?

911
00:40:22,520 --> 00:40:26,800
Because you can still get a streaming ticket and watch archives of all the stuff that we

912
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:28,840
talked about there.

913
00:40:28,840 --> 00:40:30,400
Thank you so much to everybody who was there.

914
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:34,200
You all were very, very cool and it was nice to meet everybody.

915
00:40:34,200 --> 00:40:37,160
Let's talk about some of our sponsors this week so you can get back to listening to the

916
00:40:37,160 --> 00:40:38,160
rest of the episode.

917
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:40,800
Our first sponsor is NatureBox.

918
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:42,840
If you're trying to eat better, the holidays are a minefield.

919
00:40:42,840 --> 00:40:46,840
They got chocolates, they got cookies, they got candied canes.

920
00:40:46,840 --> 00:40:50,400
Let NatureBox help you out with snacks that you love that are delicious and better for

921
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:51,400
you.

922
00:40:51,400 --> 00:40:54,800
NatureBox has over 100 delicious snacks made from high quality, simple ingredients.

923
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:57,880
That means no artificial colors, flavors, or sweeteners.

924
00:40:57,880 --> 00:41:01,480

925
00:41:01,480 --> 00:41:02,480
door.

926
00:41:02,480 --> 00:41:03,600
New snacks are added every month.

927
00:41:03,600 --> 00:41:06,240
If you don't like a snack, they'll just replace it for free.

928
00:41:06,240 --> 00:41:09,840
Right now, NatureBox is offering My Brother, My Brother, and Me fans 50% off your first

929
00:41:09,840 --> 00:41:12,760
order when you go to NatureBox.com slash my brother.

930
00:41:12,760 --> 00:41:16,400
That's NatureBox.com slash my brother for 50% off your first order.

931
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:22,520
One last time, that's NatureBox.com slash my brother.

932
00:41:22,520 --> 00:41:26,360
I also want to tell you all about Harry's because Harry's is the best way to get razors

933
00:41:26,360 --> 00:41:30,560
that you can use on any of your parts that you don't want as much hair on anymore, I

934
00:41:30,560 --> 00:41:31,560
guess.

935
00:41:31,560 --> 00:41:36,120
I have a Harry's razor that I use to shave with and it gets my face as smooth as a seal's

936
00:41:36,120 --> 00:41:37,660
ass.

937
00:41:37,660 --> 00:41:41,880
But anyway, you already know that Harry's is dedicated to making amazing quality products

938
00:41:41,880 --> 00:41:43,640
at a super reasonable price.

939
00:41:43,640 --> 00:41:45,440
But Harry's also makes a great gift.

940
00:41:45,440 --> 00:41:49,200
So this holiday, Harry's is offering custom and limited edition shaving sets.

941
00:41:49,200 --> 00:41:52,920
They come with German engineered five blade cartridges that provide a close comfortable

942
00:41:52,920 --> 00:41:53,920
shave.

943
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:56,080
They got foaming shave gel that smells amazing.

944
00:41:56,080 --> 00:42:01,520
They have special limited edition winter chrome and emerald green handles and you can personalize

945
00:42:01,520 --> 00:42:02,760
it with engraving.

946
00:42:02,760 --> 00:42:06,880
Sets come ready to gift in beautifully designed gift boxes and start at just $10.

947
00:42:06,880 --> 00:42:10,800
And as a special offer for fans, we have partnered with Harry's to give you $5 off your order

948
00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:13,300
when you go to Harry's.com slash my brother.

949
00:42:13,300 --> 00:42:15,900
This offer's only available for the holidays.

950
00:42:15,900 --> 00:42:18,200
So this holiday, give Harry's and give handsome.

951
00:42:18,200 --> 00:42:22,600

That's Harry's.com slash my brother.

955
00:42:28,960 --> 00:42:31,480
Got a few Jumbotrons for you as well.

956
00:42:31,480 --> 00:42:33,600
First off, I want to tell you about Toontown Public Works.

957
00:42:33,600 --> 00:42:35,360
It's the hot new podcast.

958
00:42:35,360 --> 00:42:37,560
So much buzz at PodCon.

959
00:42:37,560 --> 00:42:40,880
People are just gabbing, gabbing, gabbing about Toontown Public Works and those people know

960
00:42:40,880 --> 00:42:42,740
about fucking podcasts.

961
00:42:42,740 --> 00:42:46,240
Do you like old cartoons that are wrongfully or rightfully forgotten?

962
00:42:46,240 --> 00:42:48,800
Do you like hearing about the latest in animation news?

963
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:52,480
Do you like discussions of the socio-political implications of the Three Stooges?

964
00:42:52,480 --> 00:42:58,120
Join HT the raccoon, Casey the dog, and Cirque the cat in Toontown Public Works, a podcast

965
00:42:58,120 --> 00:43:02,320
of three Toons going through shorts that fell in the public domain while giving their thoughts

966
00:43:02,320 --> 00:43:04,680
on the Toons of past, present, and future.

967
00:43:04,680 --> 00:43:05,680
P.S.

968
00:43:05,680 --> 00:43:08,040
Casper isn't a dead kid, but the product of ghost fucking.

969
00:43:08,040 --> 00:43:09,040
Look it up.

970
00:43:09,040 --> 00:43:10,040
I believe I will.

971
00:43:10,040 --> 00:43:13,800
Anyway, go to iTunes, Stitcher, or wherever you get your podcasts and search for Toontown

972
00:43:13,800 --> 00:43:18,480
Public Works or just follow them on Twitter at Toontown Public.

973
00:43:18,480 --> 00:43:19,560
Another Jumbotron here.

974
00:43:19,560 --> 00:43:24,680
For this one, I want you to help out the kids of the Running to Places Theater Company at

975
00:43:24,680 --> 00:43:27,560
bit.ly slash pobuddiesnerfix.

976
00:43:27,560 --> 00:43:30,120
That's a great little URL you've secured there.

977
00:43:30,120 --> 00:43:33,560
Running to Places is a non-profit youth community theater company for teens.

978
00:43:33,560 --> 00:43:36,160
Participation is totally free and it's crazy fun.

979
00:43:36,160 --> 00:43:39,360
My name's Joey and I founded R2P 11 years ago.

980
00:43:39,360 --> 00:43:42,840
I definitely did not get approval from my board to pay for this ad.

981
00:43:42,840 --> 00:43:47,120
Please help me not get fired while helping us keep R2P free for the kiddos by donating

982
00:43:47,120 --> 00:43:52,240
at bit.ly slash pobuddiesnerfix before somebody notices the charge on our card and starts

983
00:43:52,240 --> 00:43:53,420
asking questions.

984
00:43:53,420 --> 00:43:56,480
If we get enough donations to cover the cost of the ad, am I good?

985
00:43:56,480 --> 00:43:57,480
I think so.

986
00:43:57,480 --> 00:44:01,360
Please help this person keep their job and please help keep this really cool sounding

987
00:44:01,360 --> 00:44:02,360
theater company alive.

988
00:44:02,360 --> 00:44:07,360
This sounds like a really great way to spend some of your bucks this holiday season.

989
00:44:07,360 --> 00:44:12,840
Speaking of, there's also the MBMBAM Angels Project where you can help out people in Huntington

990
00:44:12,840 --> 00:44:15,600
who are in need this holiday season.

991
00:44:15,600 --> 00:44:18,300
Our local paper puts out a list called Empty Stockings.

992
00:44:18,300 --> 00:44:26,400
It's just a list of some of the most heartbreaking things that people are asking for this holiday

993
00:44:26,400 --> 00:44:28,420
season.

994
00:44:28,420 --> 00:44:34,800
We just ask that our fans who are always so supportive of stuff like this to go to MBMBAMangels.com

995
00:44:34,800 --> 00:44:40,560
and check out some of the things that you can help out with for people in Huntington

996
00:44:40,560 --> 00:44:41,920
this holiday season.

997
00:44:41,920 --> 00:44:45,960
We sure do appreciate your generosity and we are sure that they do as well.

998
00:44:45,960 --> 00:44:47,520
Thank you to Maximum Fun for having us on the network.

999
00:44:47,520 --> 00:44:51,080

1001
00:44:55,320 --> 00:44:58,520

1002
00:44:58,520 --> 00:44:59,840
I think that's it.

1003
00:44:59,840 --> 00:45:03,040
Thank you so much for listening and thank you to everybody at PodCon who came out to

1004
00:45:03,040 --> 00:45:04,040
the panel.

1005
00:45:04,040 --> 00:45:09,960
I think next week we are going to have just sort of a regular episode and then after that,

1006
00:45:09,960 --> 00:45:14,120
well, two Mondays from now is actually Christmas Day, so it'll probably go up on Tuesday, but

1007
00:45:14,120 --> 00:45:17,440
we're probably just going to put up our Candle Nights live show that we're doing in Huntington

1008
00:45:17,440 --> 00:45:19,880
that we are so stoked for.

1009
00:45:19,880 --> 00:45:23,760
Thank you all so much for grabbing tickets for that and helping it sell out as quickly

1010
00:45:23,760 --> 00:45:24,760
as it did.

1011
00:45:24,760 --> 00:45:27,720
So, yeah, we will talk to you next week.

1012
00:45:27,720 --> 00:45:28,720
Goodbye.

1013
00:45:28,720 --> 00:45:30,200
Hey, Helen Hong.

1014
00:45:30,200 --> 00:45:33,640
Yes, J. Keith Van Straaten?

1015
00:45:33,640 --> 00:45:36,000
What's the difference between a layover and a stopover?

1016
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:37,720
I have no idea.

1017
00:45:37,720 --> 00:45:40,580
What's the difference between optimal and optimum?

1018
00:45:40,580 --> 00:45:42,140
I have no idea.

1019
00:45:42,140 --> 00:45:46,380
What's the difference between an actual conversation and a promo for our new show on Maximum Fun,

1020
00:45:46,380 --> 00:45:47,380
Go Fact Yourself?

1021
00:45:47,380 --> 00:45:49,380
Nobody has any idea.

1022
00:45:49,380 --> 00:45:53,680
Go Fact Yourself, the game show with celebrity contestants, super smart experts, and answers

1023
00:45:53,680 --> 00:45:55,880
to questions you've never even asked.

1024
00:45:55,880 --> 00:46:01,160
Listen twice a month on MaximumFun.org or wherever you get your podcasts and be in the

1025
00:46:01,160 --> 00:46:04,800
audience for our tapings of Go Fact Yourself in downtown L.A.

1026
00:46:04,800 --> 00:46:05,800
It's free.

1027
00:46:05,800 --> 00:46:08,720
Go to GoFactYourPod.com for more info.

1028
00:46:08,720 --> 00:46:10,720
We're having a very realistic conversation.

1029
00:46:10,720 --> 00:46:14,160
Yes, we are.

1030
00:46:14,160 --> 00:46:16,240
I have another Yahoo if you all want it.

1031
00:46:16,240 --> 00:46:17,240
Yeah.

1032
00:46:17,240 --> 00:46:18,240
Well, do you want to...

1033
00:46:18,240 --> 00:46:19,240
Okay.

1034
00:46:19,240 --> 00:46:20,240
Yeah.

1035
00:46:20,240 --> 00:46:21,240
What's wrong?

1036
00:46:21,240 --> 00:46:22,240
No, I just...

1037
00:46:22,240 --> 00:46:23,240
We had the other question.

1038
00:46:23,240 --> 00:46:24,240
I didn't know if you wanted to...

1039
00:46:24,240 --> 00:46:25,240
Yeah, let's do the Yahoo first.

1040
00:46:25,240 --> 00:46:26,240
Yeah.

1041
00:46:26,240 --> 00:46:27,240
It's from Aaron Keith sent this one in.

1042
00:46:27,240 --> 00:46:28,240
Thank you, Aaron.

1043
00:46:28,240 --> 00:46:29,240
It's Yahoo.

1044
00:46:29,240 --> 00:46:30,240
It's an anonymous Yahoo answers user.

1045
00:46:30,240 --> 00:46:32,000
We're going to call them...

1046
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:33,000
Anonymous.

1047
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:34,000
Okay.

1048
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:37,200
Travis decided that anonymous is the funniest name to call them.

1049
00:46:37,200 --> 00:46:39,560
No, it's A. It's short for Aaron-nonymous.

1050
00:46:39,560 --> 00:46:40,560
Aaron-nonymous.

1051
00:46:40,560 --> 00:46:41,560
Oof.

1052
00:46:41,560 --> 00:46:42,560
Still.

1053
00:46:42,560 --> 00:46:50,440
Asks, what does Robert want for Christmas?

1054
00:46:50,440 --> 00:46:57,160
Robert, are you here?

1055
00:46:57,160 --> 00:46:58,440
Robert.

1056
00:46:58,440 --> 00:47:01,600
Our group of friends are exchanging gifts for Christmas this year, but I have no idea

1057
00:47:01,600 --> 00:47:03,160
what Robert wants.

1058
00:47:03,160 --> 00:47:06,040
Hey, real quick show of hands.

1059
00:47:06,040 --> 00:47:08,000
How many Roberts do we have?

1060
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:10,400
Okay, wait.

1061
00:47:10,400 --> 00:47:11,400
Keep them up.

1062
00:47:11,400 --> 00:47:12,620
One, two.

1063
00:47:12,620 --> 00:47:14,120
This is your day, Roberts.

1064
00:47:14,120 --> 00:47:15,120
Congrats.

1065
00:47:15,120 --> 00:47:16,120
Hey, everybody.

1066
00:47:16,120 --> 00:47:17,120
Not as many as I would have thought.

1067
00:47:17,120 --> 00:47:19,120
Can I get every Robert to just stand up real quick?

1068
00:47:19,120 --> 00:47:21,160
Hey, everybody, let's give them a big round of applause.

1069
00:47:21,160 --> 00:47:24,320
Thank you to all the Roberts for coming out.

1070
00:47:24,320 --> 00:47:25,320
So cool, you guys.

1071
00:47:25,320 --> 00:47:26,320
Thank you.

1072
00:47:26,320 --> 00:47:27,320
Yeah.

1073
00:47:27,320 --> 00:47:28,760
We're going to get Robert here.

1074
00:47:28,760 --> 00:47:29,760
Thank you, Robert.

1075
00:47:29,760 --> 00:47:30,760
Now, sit down, Robert.

1076
00:47:30,760 --> 00:47:31,760
That's it.

1077
00:47:31,760 --> 00:47:32,760
All right.

1078
00:47:32,760 --> 00:47:39,680
Now, the people who are with Robert, what does Robert want for Christmas?

1079
00:47:39,680 --> 00:47:46,480
A copy of Terminator 2 on DVD so he can remember the great time he had shooting that movie

1080
00:47:46,480 --> 00:47:48,040
with his friend Arnold Schwarzenegger.

1081
00:47:48,040 --> 00:47:50,840
Yes, it's Robert Patrick.

1082
00:47:50,840 --> 00:47:52,440
Robert Patrick's here?

1083
00:47:52,440 --> 00:47:57,240
Maybe some nice, pulpy orange juice because it's Robert Loja, and that's about as

1084
00:47:57,240 --> 00:48:01,200
deep a cut as I can possibly deliver here on My Brother, My Brother, Me is the orange

1085
00:48:01,200 --> 00:48:05,000
juice commercial starring Robert Loja.

1086
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:10,920
After our show or during it, if it keeps up like this, Google Robert Loja orange juice

1087
00:48:10,920 --> 00:48:11,920
commercial.

1088
00:48:11,920 --> 00:48:12,920
You're in for a real treat.

1089
00:48:12,920 --> 00:48:13,920
What is Robert?

1090
00:48:13,920 --> 00:48:17,840
Maybe Robert wants 10,000 American dollars.

1091
00:48:17,840 --> 00:48:19,240
Choice.

1092
00:48:19,240 --> 00:48:21,240
It fits every time.

1093
00:48:21,240 --> 00:48:26,240
Maybe what Robert wants is for you to get to know Robert well enough to know what Robert

1094
00:48:26,240 --> 00:48:27,440
wants.

1095
00:48:27,440 --> 00:48:29,480
Maybe you haven't spent enough time one-on-one.

1096
00:48:29,480 --> 00:48:30,480
Applause.

1097
00:48:30,480 --> 00:48:33,040
A weird peel of applause.

1098
00:48:33,040 --> 00:48:37,160
Yeah, Robert's been in the dumps lately.

1099
00:48:37,160 --> 00:48:38,720
Robert just wants a fucking friend.

1100
00:48:38,720 --> 00:48:45,000
I need a new season of Serial to explain why that applause just happened.

1101
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:49,320
I need a forensic examination of where it started and who was my absolute friend.

1102
00:48:49,320 --> 00:48:51,320
Maybe Robert needs a friend.

1103
00:48:51,320 --> 00:48:52,320
Yes.

1104
00:48:52,320 --> 00:48:55,300
Episode one would be like blink, blink, blink, blink.

1105
00:48:55,300 --> 00:48:58,240
They certainly didn't earn that applause.

1106
00:48:58,240 --> 00:49:02,200
Where did it come from?

1107
00:49:02,200 --> 00:49:05,440
Maybe Robert wants you to fucking stop calling him Bob.

1108
00:49:05,440 --> 00:49:08,600
Yeah, he would very much appreciate that.

1109
00:49:08,600 --> 00:49:11,000
He's asked you so many times.

1110
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:13,120
I should have asked how many Bobs we have.

1111
00:49:13,120 --> 00:49:14,600
Oh, how many Bobs?

1112
00:49:14,600 --> 00:49:15,600
No, we're done.

1113
00:49:15,600 --> 00:49:19,560
That bit plays once and sometimes not even that many times.

1114
00:49:19,560 --> 00:49:21,920
How many people here aren't named Robert?

1115
00:49:21,920 --> 00:49:31,280
Okay, one, two, uh, are you done talking about Robert?

1116
00:49:31,280 --> 00:49:35,480
Robert's so great, but I'm actually done talking about Robert.

1117
00:49:35,480 --> 00:49:36,480
Probably a blanket.

1118
00:49:36,480 --> 00:49:38,520
How good's that last question?

1119
00:49:38,520 --> 00:49:41,560
It's the one with the kid.

1120
00:49:41,560 --> 00:49:43,040
I don't know what the fuck you're talking about.

1121
00:49:43,040 --> 00:49:44,520
Now, let's go to audience questions.

1122
00:49:44,520 --> 00:49:45,520
All right.

1123
00:49:45,520 --> 00:49:46,520
Sorry, kid.

1124
00:49:46,520 --> 00:49:51,360
I'm just gonna read it and then we won't address it, but now it won't be a fucking mystery.

1125
00:49:51,360 --> 00:49:56,000
I don't want serial season three to be like, he said it was about a kid.

1126
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:58,000
Blink, blink, blink.

1127
00:49:58,000 --> 00:49:59,880
I have a nephew who just turned three years old.

1128
00:49:59,880 --> 00:50:04,160
Whenever anyone is upset, he likes to diffuse the tension by yelling things and being silly

1129
00:50:04,160 --> 00:50:05,600
until everyone is cheerful again.

1130
00:50:05,600 --> 00:50:07,760
I'm right there with you, kid.

1131
00:50:07,760 --> 00:50:08,760
That's adorable.

1132
00:50:08,760 --> 00:50:15,400
However, lately his go-to phrase for this has been fucking A, which he picked up from

1133
00:50:15,400 --> 00:50:16,400
my mom.

1134
00:50:16,400 --> 00:50:18,880
While it's not a huge deal with us, he may be going to daycare soon and probably shouldn't

1135
00:50:18,880 --> 00:50:20,860
be swearing around other people's kids.

1136
00:50:20,860 --> 00:50:22,840
How do we get him to stop swearing?

1137
00:50:22,840 --> 00:50:25,200
That's from Ant of a Cool Seattle Baby.

1138
00:50:25,200 --> 00:50:26,200
Just get rules.

1139
00:50:26,200 --> 00:50:27,200
Just get rules.

1140
00:50:27,200 --> 00:50:28,200
I don't have an answer.

1141
00:50:28,200 --> 00:50:29,200
Oh, hey, check this out.

1142
00:50:29,200 --> 00:50:30,200
Hey, fucking A, you smell great.

1143
00:50:30,200 --> 00:50:31,200
That's not...

1144
00:50:31,200 --> 00:50:32,200
That does it.

1145
00:50:32,200 --> 00:50:33,200
That's fine, right?

1146
00:50:33,200 --> 00:50:34,200
Yeah.

1147
00:50:34,200 --> 00:50:35,200
Let's hear it for the boy.

1148
00:50:35,200 --> 00:50:36,200
Should we go to the audience questions now?

1149
00:50:36,200 --> 00:50:37,200
Fucking A.

1150
00:50:37,200 --> 00:50:38,200
Yeah, all right.

1151
00:50:38,200 --> 00:50:43,200
Can we get lights up on the crowd?

1152
00:50:43,200 --> 00:50:53,960
So, we have runners who are going to come by with microphones.

1153
00:50:53,960 --> 00:50:58,000
Please stay chill about this.

1154
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:01,080
I need like full house lights because there's a bunch of people here and we can't see them

1155
00:51:01,080 --> 00:51:02,080
at all.

1156
00:51:02,080 --> 00:51:03,080
Now, listen.

1157
00:51:03,080 --> 00:51:05,080
What I would need you all to do, if you have your hand raised...

1158
00:51:05,080 --> 00:51:06,080
Oh, yeah.

1159
00:51:06,080 --> 00:51:07,080
We have two rules.

1160
00:51:07,080 --> 00:51:08,080
All right.

1161
00:51:08,080 --> 00:51:14,160
What I think is the thing I'm about to ask an actual request for advice or is it just

1162
00:51:14,160 --> 00:51:15,560
a funny story that I think is funny?

1163
00:51:15,560 --> 00:51:17,160
Please do not let it be the latter.

1164
00:51:17,160 --> 00:51:18,160
We also...

1165
00:51:18,160 --> 00:51:19,160
Oh, shit.

1166
00:51:19,160 --> 00:51:20,160
There's so many...

1167
00:51:20,160 --> 00:51:21,160
We did a bad job of walking into this segment.

1168
00:51:21,160 --> 00:51:22,160
You know the main rule is?

1169
00:51:22,160 --> 00:51:23,160
No.

1170
00:51:23,160 --> 00:51:24,160
No.

1171
00:51:24,160 --> 00:51:25,160
No.

1172
00:51:25,160 --> 00:51:26,160
No.

1173
00:51:26,160 --> 00:51:27,160
No.

1174
00:51:27,160 --> 00:51:28,160
No.

1175
00:51:28,160 --> 00:51:29,160
No.

1176
00:51:29,160 --> 00:51:30,160
No.

1177
00:51:30,160 --> 00:51:31,160
No.

1178
00:51:31,160 --> 00:51:32,160
No.

1179
00:51:32,160 --> 00:51:33,160
No.

1180
00:51:33,160 --> 00:51:34,160
No.

1181
00:51:34,160 --> 00:51:35,160
No.

1182
00:51:35,160 --> 00:51:36,160
No.

1183
00:51:36,160 --> 00:51:37,160
No.

1184
00:51:37,160 --> 00:51:38,160
No.

1185
00:51:38,160 --> 00:51:39,160
No.

1186
00:51:39,160 --> 00:51:40,160
All right.

1187
00:51:40,160 --> 00:51:41,160
Stay there, stay there.

1188
00:51:41,160 --> 00:51:42,160
Stay there.

1189
00:51:42,160 --> 00:51:43,160
You're number one.

1190
00:51:43,160 --> 00:51:44,160
And then, on this side sitting on the aisle with the black shirt.

1191
00:51:44,160 --> 00:51:45,160
You're pointing at yourself.

1192
00:51:45,160 --> 00:51:46,160
Yeah.

1193
00:51:46,160 --> 00:51:47,160
Yeah.

1194
00:51:47,160 --> 00:51:48,160
Yeah.

1195
00:51:48,160 --> 00:51:49,160
Cool.

1196
00:51:49,160 --> 00:51:50,160
All right.

1197
00:51:50,160 --> 00:51:51,160
We'll start with you since you were there first.

1198
00:51:51,160 --> 00:51:52,160
What's your name?

1199
00:51:52,160 --> 00:51:53,160
Lisa?

1200
00:51:53,160 --> 00:51:54,160
Hi, Lisa.

1201
00:51:54,160 --> 00:51:55,160
What's you're question?

1202
00:51:55,160 --> 00:51:57,120
So, I'm in charge of entertainment for a company party.

1203
00:51:57,120 --> 00:52:05,080
It's a global event and I've accidentally booked three different acapella groups for

1204
00:52:05,080 --> 00:52:06,080
the same.

1205
00:52:06,080 --> 00:52:07,080
Another?

1206
00:52:07,080 --> 00:52:14,580
Okay, can I get the audience mics turned up like twice as loud as they are right now?

1207
00:52:14,580 --> 00:52:18,300
Because I want to experience every moment of this with you.

1208
00:52:18,300 --> 00:52:21,940
You have booked multiple three acapella groups for one party.

1209
00:52:21,940 --> 00:52:25,820
For a half hour period.

1210
00:52:25,820 --> 00:52:28,620
And it's on Tuesday.

1211
00:52:28,620 --> 00:52:29,620
How do you quit your job?

1212
00:52:29,620 --> 00:52:33,700
How do I change my identity and move to Canada?

1213
00:52:33,700 --> 00:52:35,140
Okay, that's very good.

1214
00:52:35,140 --> 00:52:37,400
Wait, I do want to hear the request.

1215
00:52:37,400 --> 00:52:39,240
What do you need our help with?

1216
00:52:39,240 --> 00:52:40,720
Did I make a mistake?

1217
00:52:40,720 --> 00:52:41,720
No.

1218
00:52:41,720 --> 00:52:42,960
Okay, what's here?

1219
00:52:42,960 --> 00:52:43,960
What is the actual question?

1220
00:52:43,960 --> 00:52:46,240
What should I do about that?

1221
00:52:46,240 --> 00:52:48,680
Yeah, we can work with that.

1222
00:52:48,680 --> 00:52:49,680
What's your name?

1223
00:52:49,680 --> 00:52:50,680
Hi, I'm Lex.

1224
00:52:50,680 --> 00:52:52,600
Hi Lex, what's your question?

1225
00:52:52,600 --> 00:52:58,040
So I live with my boyfriend and we keep getting into this argument over whether we should

1226
00:52:58,040 --> 00:53:01,300
have a Lord of the Rings wedding.

1227
00:53:01,300 --> 00:53:07,740
I am asking you to help me convince him to just have a normal like elegant wedding.

1228
00:53:07,740 --> 00:53:10,720
I'm kind of a closet nerd.

1229
00:53:10,720 --> 00:53:11,720
Okay.

1230
00:53:11,720 --> 00:53:13,720
I know that's a bad one to ask you.

1231
00:53:13,720 --> 00:53:18,160
No, well, hold on.

1232
00:53:18,160 --> 00:53:22,480
Because under and between the beautiful cliffs of Rivendell, I think you could throw a pretty

1233
00:53:22,480 --> 00:53:23,480
fucking elegant wedding.

1234
00:53:23,480 --> 00:53:26,900
That's what I'm saying, don't assume.

1235
00:53:26,900 --> 00:53:27,900
The elves.

1236
00:53:27,900 --> 00:53:31,960
The elves know how to throw an elegant soiree.

1237
00:53:31,960 --> 00:53:32,960
Can I tell you something?

1238
00:53:32,960 --> 00:53:33,960
Okay, straight up.

1239
00:53:33,960 --> 00:53:34,960
We're going to do the acapella one.

1240
00:53:34,960 --> 00:53:37,520
The acapella one, I'm going to do it because that's the best shit I've ever heard.

1241
00:53:37,520 --> 00:53:38,800
But you can help with that.

1242
00:53:38,800 --> 00:53:40,240
But it's not that your question is not good.

1243
00:53:40,240 --> 00:53:42,960
I can answer it in one like one sentence.

1244
00:53:42,960 --> 00:53:43,960
Here he goes.

1245
00:53:43,960 --> 00:53:46,160
Everybody step back.

1246
00:53:46,160 --> 00:53:50,560
You only get one wedding and everyone does just a wedding.

1247
00:53:50,560 --> 00:53:53,640
We had a Lord of the Rings wedding is way more interesting.

1248
00:53:53,640 --> 00:53:54,640
For sure.

1249
00:53:54,640 --> 00:54:05,880
Tell them you want to do a Buckaroo Bonsai themed wedding and then settle.

1250
00:54:05,880 --> 00:54:10,440
And then when you can't agree, just be like, fine, we'll just do a normal wedding then.

1251
00:54:10,440 --> 00:54:12,960
I love Buckaroo Bonsai.

1252
00:54:12,960 --> 00:54:15,120
What about a labyrinth themed wedding?

1253
00:54:15,120 --> 00:54:17,480
Okay, there you go.

1254
00:54:17,480 --> 00:54:18,480
Thank you.

1255
00:54:18,480 --> 00:54:23,520
Would you do a normal wedding, but both of you had to carry big, big swords?

1256
00:54:23,520 --> 00:54:25,720
Okay, wait, wait, wait.

1257
00:54:25,720 --> 00:54:27,280
Here's the compromise.

1258
00:54:27,280 --> 00:54:31,640
Normal wedding, but tell one person in the bridal party that it's a Lord of the Rings

1259
00:54:31,640 --> 00:54:32,640
themed wedding.

1260
00:54:32,640 --> 00:54:33,640
Yes.

1261
00:54:33,640 --> 00:54:34,640
Yes.

1262
00:54:34,640 --> 00:54:37,240
I think we should reserve that for what?

1263
00:54:37,240 --> 00:54:38,240
Maybe your brother?

1264
00:54:38,240 --> 00:54:39,240
Yeah.

1265
00:54:39,240 --> 00:54:40,240
No.

1266
00:54:40,240 --> 00:54:41,240
Perfect.

1267
00:54:41,240 --> 00:54:42,240
Perfect.

1268
00:54:42,240 --> 00:54:43,240
Send him links to costumes, everything.

1269
00:54:43,240 --> 00:54:44,920
There's only one person in your bridal party.

1270
00:54:44,920 --> 00:54:45,960
It's Andy Serkis.

1271
00:54:45,960 --> 00:54:48,320
He's wearing a green screen suit.

1272
00:54:48,320 --> 00:54:53,120
And then on your cut of the wedding movie, he's just wearing a normal tuxedo.

1273
00:54:53,120 --> 00:54:57,680
And the other one, he's everyone's favorite little monster named Gollum.

1274
00:54:57,680 --> 00:54:58,680
Thank you very much.

1275
00:54:58,680 --> 00:54:59,680
Thank you.

1276
00:54:59,680 --> 00:55:01,480
Okay, a cappella groups.

1277
00:55:01,480 --> 00:55:08,960
Did you book three a cappella groups for a half hour or did you book one new super cool

1278
00:55:08,960 --> 00:55:11,280
a cappella group for half hour?

1279
00:55:11,280 --> 00:55:12,920
Because I think it's the latter.

1280
00:55:12,920 --> 00:55:16,160
I think that this is a lot of behind the music start this way.

1281
00:55:16,160 --> 00:55:19,600
Like we were just three different a cappella groups, weren't we?

1282
00:55:19,600 --> 00:55:22,440
And we all showed up for the same gig, believe it or not.

1283
00:55:22,440 --> 00:55:25,840
And we decided, hey, let's all sing together.

1284
00:55:25,840 --> 00:55:26,840
And then.

1285
00:55:26,840 --> 00:55:28,320
And that's how the Beatles got started.

1286
00:55:28,320 --> 00:55:30,840
That's how the Beatles got started, didn't they?

1287
00:55:30,840 --> 00:55:34,920
So the polyphonic spree got started.

1288
00:55:34,920 --> 00:55:38,520
If you just pay all of them and two of them don't have to sing, they're probably happy

1289
00:55:38,520 --> 00:55:39,520
about that.

1290
00:55:39,520 --> 00:55:40,520
They're probably good.

1291
00:55:40,520 --> 00:55:41,520
You're like, here's your $30.

1292
00:55:41,520 --> 00:55:42,520
Like, oh, dunk.

1293
00:55:42,520 --> 00:55:43,520
Okay, bye.

1294
00:55:43,520 --> 00:55:44,520
How did you?

1295
00:55:44,520 --> 00:55:45,520
How did you do this?

1296
00:55:45,520 --> 00:55:46,520
How did you do this?

1297
00:55:46,520 --> 00:55:49,520
How did you fuck up this bad?

1298
00:55:49,520 --> 00:55:54,280
How did you were you on a like conference call and you didn't realize that you said

1299
00:55:54,280 --> 00:56:01,760
you're hired and you heard three beautiful choral voices say, thank you.

1300
00:56:01,760 --> 00:56:09,440
I was told to book some entertainment on Thursday.

1301
00:56:09,440 --> 00:56:15,560
And I just reached out to as many groups as I could and some with instruments and some

1302
00:56:15,560 --> 00:56:16,560
without.

1303
00:56:16,560 --> 00:56:21,560
Yes, but the only ones available for that were available and that close of a notice

1304
00:56:21,560 --> 00:56:23,840
were the acapella groups.

1305
00:56:23,840 --> 00:56:26,560
And what was the wording of this content?

1306
00:56:26,560 --> 00:56:29,080
Like you are hired sight unseen.

1307
00:56:29,080 --> 00:56:30,080
Just say yes.

1308
00:56:30,080 --> 00:56:32,480
It was more like we've seen your videos.

1309
00:56:32,480 --> 00:56:33,480
We're very interested.

1310
00:56:33,480 --> 00:56:34,480
Were you lying?

1311
00:56:34,480 --> 00:56:35,480
Yes.

1312
00:56:35,480 --> 00:56:36,480
Okay.

1313
00:56:36,480 --> 00:56:37,480
Everybody loves the video.

1314
00:56:37,480 --> 00:56:38,480
Everybody.

1315
00:56:38,480 --> 00:56:39,480
Everybody's talking about videos.

1316
00:56:39,480 --> 00:56:40,480

1352
00:57:15,480 --> 00:57:19,360
thank you very much thank you very much okay can we get the house lights back up

1353
00:57:19,360 --> 00:57:23,600
yeah cuz we're just gonna lose these fucking microphones we will start now

1354
00:57:23,600 --> 00:57:30,120
with you what's your name hello my name is Emeline hi Emeline hello Emeline so we

1355
00:57:30,120 --> 00:57:36,480
have too many furries in our D&D party what no such thing next question

1356
00:57:36,480 --> 00:57:46,480
Why are you trying to get us in trouble again? We got in trouble once alright we'll never do that again.

1357
00:57:46,480 --> 00:57:56,480
Hello Toronto! We got a lot of furries today! Listen! I love the culture and lifestyle!

1358
00:57:56,480 --> 00:58:00,480
You're all so supportive of each other in other projects!

1359
00:58:00,480 --> 00:58:04,480
There's a bit on there about five minutes later when Paul said he's like

1360
00:58:04,480 --> 00:58:08,480
Do any girls out there like to get licked?

1361
00:58:08,480 --> 00:58:10,480
Yeah it's a bad part of the audio.

1362
00:58:10,480 --> 00:58:12,480
There's a bad part of the audio and then instantly afterwards

1363
00:58:12,480 --> 00:58:14,480
he's like and God bless him Paul Stanley goes

1364
00:58:14,480 --> 00:58:18,480
Do any guys out there like to get licked?

1365
00:58:18,480 --> 00:58:22,480
It's like good for you Paul let's just ask everybody if they like to get licked

1366
00:58:22,480 --> 00:58:26,480
What about all our gender non-binary people?

1367
00:58:26,480 --> 00:58:34,480
Who doesn't conform to the gender spectrum but likes to get licked?

1368
00:58:34,480 --> 00:58:38,480
We will consider that question I do not know

1369
00:58:38,480 --> 00:58:44,480
Let me offer a small reason. There's not enough furries in my group.

1370
00:58:44,480 --> 00:58:48,480
Is it a party composition issue where everybody wants to play like a bug bear

1371
00:58:48,480 --> 00:58:53,480
or some sort of I don't know if there are furry races in D&D

1372
00:58:53,480 --> 00:58:56,480
Okay yes there are actually Jeffrey

1373
00:58:56,480 --> 00:58:58,480
That's so sweet okay all right

1374
00:58:58,480 --> 00:59:00,480
Hi what's your name?

1375
00:59:00,480 --> 00:59:01,480
Heda

1376
00:59:01,480 --> 00:59:02,480
Hi

1377
00:59:02,480 --> 00:59:06,480
Hi so for the last five years I've been trying to distance myself from

1378
00:59:06,480 --> 00:59:09,480
quite the extensive goth face

1379
00:59:09,480 --> 00:59:10,480
Okay

1380
00:59:10,480 --> 00:59:11,480
As I'm sure many of us can relate to

1381
00:59:11,480 --> 00:59:12,480
So I'm here

1382
00:59:12,480 --> 00:59:13,480
For sure

1383
00:59:13,480 --> 00:59:14,480
Yeah tell me about it

1384
00:59:14,480 --> 00:59:16,480
Unless you're still into it in which case stand in your truth

1385
00:59:16,480 --> 00:59:21,480
Well something that's made that quite difficult is that my family owns

1386
00:59:21,480 --> 00:59:23,480
a number of funeral homes

1387
00:59:23,480 --> 00:59:24,480
Okay

1388
00:59:24,480 --> 00:59:26,480
A number?

1389
00:59:26,480 --> 00:59:27,480
A number of funeral homes

1390
00:59:27,480 --> 00:59:30,480
Is the number more than one?

1391
00:59:30,480 --> 00:59:31,480
Yes

1392
00:59:31,480 --> 00:59:33,480
That's quite a lot of funeral homes

1393
00:59:33,480 --> 00:59:34,480
That's quite a lot of funeral homes

1394
00:59:34,480 --> 00:59:37,480
Congratulations that sounds like a very profitable business

1395
00:59:37,480 --> 00:59:38,480
Congrats to your family

1396
00:59:38,480 --> 00:59:42,480
Yeah so what what do I do when my friends walk past funeral homes

1397
00:59:42,480 --> 00:59:45,480
with my last name slapped up over them in a frankly way too gothic font

1398
00:59:45,480 --> 00:59:48,480
You flash that dead cash

1399
00:59:48,480 --> 00:59:51,480
I'm gonna help I'm gonna help you it's time

1400
00:59:51,480 --> 00:59:52,480
I think we're gonna go with this one

1401
00:59:52,480 --> 00:59:53,480
Thank you very very much

1402
00:59:53,480 --> 00:59:54,480
Very much

1403
00:59:54,480 --> 00:59:55,480
I'm gonna help you and it's very

1404
00:59:55,480 --> 00:59:57,480
Can we get a round of applause for Emeline please

1405
00:59:57,480 --> 00:59:58,480
Thank you

1406
00:59:58,480 --> 00:59:59,480
Round of applause for Emeline

1407
00:59:59,480 --> 01:00:04,480
Get more furries the lights again the lights if I could just have those lights back

1408
01:00:04,480 --> 01:00:06,480
The lights do keep disappearing

1409
01:00:06,480 --> 01:00:11,480
It's time for you to rebel against the family business and what I mean by that

1410
01:00:11,480 --> 01:00:14,480
I mean never die

1411
01:00:14,480 --> 01:00:16,480
What a cool thing for you to be like

1412
01:00:16,480 --> 01:00:19,480
That's not the opposite of being a funeral home

1413
01:00:19,480 --> 01:00:24,480
Yeah no it's like hey listen mom and dad sorry I'm not interested in the family biz

1414
01:00:24,480 --> 01:00:27,480
I'm never gonna die

1415
01:00:27,480 --> 01:00:30,480
And he just loudly and now and like anytime they start talking about it

1416
01:00:30,480 --> 01:00:34,480
Just be like death that's for suckers

1417
01:00:34,480 --> 01:00:36,480
I don't buy it show me the evidence

1418
01:00:36,480 --> 01:00:40,480
Make sure you do that while funerals are happening at the funeral

1419
01:00:40,480 --> 01:00:44,480
Got another one huh death what a sucker

1420
01:00:44,480 --> 01:00:45,480
What a waste of cash

1421
01:00:45,480 --> 01:00:48,480
Get you to the coffin next time try not dying

1422
01:00:48,480 --> 01:00:55,480
Yeah that's my thing and the thing is that's great about that is it works until it doesn't

1423
01:00:55,480 --> 01:00:57,480
And then you don't have to be there

1424
01:00:57,480 --> 01:01:02,480
You don't have to sweat it like you're basically immortal in that sense if you think about it

1425
01:01:02,480 --> 01:01:03,480
We're all temporarily immortal

1426
01:01:03,480 --> 01:01:06,480
Jesus okay now that essential dread is great

1427
01:01:06,480 --> 01:01:09,480
Listen this is the first time our show has ever been interesting

1428
01:01:09,480 --> 01:01:14,480
Listen listen listen is it a fun funeral home

1429
01:01:14,480 --> 01:01:16,480
Is there a ball pit

1430
01:01:16,480 --> 01:01:17,480
Is there a ball pit

1431
01:01:17,480 --> 01:01:18,480
A funeral home

1432
01:01:18,480 --> 01:01:20,480
The ball pit is full of skulls

1433
01:01:20,480 --> 01:01:22,480
What the fuck

1434
01:01:22,480 --> 01:01:23,480
I'm kidding I'm kidding

1435
01:01:23,480 --> 01:01:26,480
Is that the aesthetic of your funeral homes

1436
01:01:26,480 --> 01:01:27,480
Okay listen

1437
01:01:27,480 --> 01:01:28,480
No it's very classy

1438
01:01:28,480 --> 01:01:31,480
Okay okay straight up

1439
01:01:31,480 --> 01:01:35,480
Your family owns a number of funeral homes

1440
01:01:35,480 --> 01:01:39,480
You should just keep being goth because then people will see you out and about

1441
01:01:39,480 --> 01:01:42,480
Hear me out and they're like oh god and then like you're like come with me

1442
01:01:42,480 --> 01:01:47,480
My home's full of dead people and they're like come by it on us

1443
01:01:47,480 --> 01:01:53,480
I'm sorry there are some gross misconceptions about what funeral homes are happening on this stage

1444
01:01:53,480 --> 01:01:57,480
They're not chock-a-block full of dead people

1445
01:01:57,480 --> 01:01:59,480
Okay wait hold on hold on

1446
01:01:59,480 --> 01:02:01,480
They're not sorting through a queue

1447
01:02:01,480 --> 01:02:05,480
Okay but statistically speaking are there more dead people in a funeral home than your home

1448
01:02:05,480 --> 01:02:08,480
I am the oldest brother

1449
01:02:08,480 --> 01:02:15,480
I am 37 years old and I'm ready to talk about anything else

1450
01:02:15,480 --> 01:02:19,480
I hope that helped because this segment is over

1451
01:02:19,480 --> 01:02:21,480
Thank you very much

1452
01:02:21,480 --> 01:02:23,480
All right let's get those house lights back eh

1453
01:02:23,480 --> 01:02:24,480
House lights way up

1454
01:02:24,480 --> 01:02:26,480
Let's get somebody way over

1455
01:02:26,480 --> 01:02:32,480
Okay we don't usually do this for prop work but somebody has a sign that says the dog pound and I'm very interested in

1456
01:02:32,480 --> 01:02:33,480
Dog pounds in

1457
01:02:33,480 --> 01:02:34,480
Absolutely

1458
01:02:34,480 --> 01:02:36,480
Well I guess whoever wants it

1459
01:02:36,480 --> 01:02:39,480
And someone has an actual dog with their hands raised

1460
01:02:39,480 --> 01:02:41,480
With the dog in it oh okay

1461
01:02:41,480 --> 01:02:44,480
Hell yeah I hope this question is about the dog

1462
01:02:44,480 --> 01:02:46,480
Oh wait does the dog have a question

1463
01:02:46,480 --> 01:02:48,480
Oh the dog pound sign yes the dog pound sign

1464
01:02:48,480 --> 01:02:49,480
You're holding it

1465
01:02:49,480 --> 01:02:51,480
Oh wait a minute hold on

1466
01:02:51,480 --> 01:02:52,480
Hold on was that it

1467
01:02:52,480 --> 01:02:53,480
I have to change my mind

1468
01:02:53,480 --> 01:02:57,480
The dog pound we all have brothers do you guys fight a lot like

1469
01:02:57,480 --> 01:02:58,480
Is that the question

1470
01:02:58,480 --> 01:02:59,480
Yeah that's

1471
01:02:59,480 --> 01:03:00,480
That's not advice

1472
01:03:00,480 --> 01:03:04,480
You don't need advice just like I want to find out a little bit more about those three crazy mackerel eyes

1473
01:03:04,480 --> 01:03:05,480
We never fight

1474
01:03:05,480 --> 01:03:07,480
The dog pound like many other mackerel

1475
01:03:07,480 --> 01:03:08,480
What is this hive mind

1476
01:03:08,480 --> 01:03:09,480
Bound out

1477
01:03:09,480 --> 01:03:11,480
We are dog pound

1478
01:03:11,480 --> 01:03:12,480
Okay

1479
01:03:12,480 --> 01:03:13,480
Hello

1480
01:03:13,480 --> 01:03:14,480
Hi I'm Cory

1481
01:03:14,480 --> 01:03:15,480
What's your name

1482
01:03:15,480 --> 01:03:16,480
Sorry

1483
01:03:16,480 --> 01:03:17,480
Cory

1484
01:03:17,480 --> 01:03:18,480
Hey Cory

1485
01:03:18,480 --> 01:03:19,480
And the dog's name

1486
01:03:19,480 --> 01:03:20,480
This is Falkor

1487
01:03:20,480 --> 01:03:21,480
Oh yes

1488
01:03:21,480 --> 01:03:22,480
Yeah

1489
01:03:22,480 --> 01:03:23,480
Oh Lord of the Rings

1490
01:03:23,480 --> 01:03:26,480
Shit

1491
01:03:26,480 --> 01:03:28,480
I see I was gonna make an Amadeus Amadeus joke

1492
01:03:28,480 --> 01:03:29,480
Nope

1493
01:03:29,480 --> 01:03:30,480
And I backed off

1494
01:03:30,480 --> 01:03:32,480
What is the question

1495
01:03:32,480 --> 01:03:38,480
So I was at the dentist the other day and the dentist was telling me about her favorite super movie superhero movies

1496
01:03:38,480 --> 01:03:41,480
This is starting to sound like a joke like a joke with a punchline

1497
01:03:41,480 --> 01:03:42,480
No it's good okay okay

1498
01:03:42,480 --> 01:03:46,480
I mean there's a jokey thing in it but I have a real question

1499
01:03:46,480 --> 01:03:49,480
While I had the dental dam in she told me her favorite

1500
01:03:49,480 --> 01:03:50,480
Is that what it's called

1501
01:03:50,480 --> 01:03:51,480
Yes

1502
01:03:51,480 --> 01:03:53,480
Groany okay

1503
01:03:53,480 --> 01:03:56,480
She told me her favorite character was X-Man

1504
01:03:56,480 --> 01:03:57,480
And

1505
01:03:57,480 --> 01:04:00,480
Oh no

1506
01:04:00,480 --> 01:04:03,480
She thinks Wolverine's name is X-Man

1507
01:04:03,480 --> 01:04:05,480
Okay good good good

1508
01:04:05,480 --> 01:04:06,480
I couldn't say anything

1509
01:04:06,480 --> 01:04:07,480
Right

1510
01:04:07,480 --> 01:04:10,480
And then later it seemed too late but now I'm worried

1511
01:04:10,480 --> 01:04:13,480
That she's gonna like have some dude bro

1512
01:04:13,480 --> 01:04:16,480
She's gonna say this to him and they're gonna be really condescending

1513
01:04:16,480 --> 01:04:17,480
Yeah

1514
01:04:17,480 --> 01:04:20,480
No yeah that's definitely getting the pipeline I feel like unfortunately

1515
01:04:20,480 --> 01:04:25,480
Actually in fact when she said X-Man some dude bro somewhere went

1516
01:04:25,480 --> 01:04:26,480
Wrong

1517
01:04:26,480 --> 01:04:31,480
You should yeah the windows must be very thick there because I bet a guy was like flinging himself against it

1518
01:04:31,480 --> 01:04:35,480
Well actually well actually wait actually

1519
01:04:35,480 --> 01:04:36,480
Dogpound thank you very much

1520
01:04:36,480 --> 01:04:39,480
Thank you Dogpound I'm gonna help this Wolverine

1521
01:04:39,480 --> 01:04:44,480
When you said you couldn't did you mean because you were petrified by awkwardness

1522
01:04:44,480 --> 01:04:48,480
Because that's what I would feel if someone said my favorite superhero is X-Man I would go

1523
01:04:48,480 --> 01:04:49,480
Oh

1524
01:04:49,480 --> 01:04:53,480
I mean I would get worried that this is some silver age bullshit that I didn't actually know about

1525
01:04:53,480 --> 01:05:00,480
I'd be like X-Man's not a thing and I'd be like actually in 1941 Jack Kirby did something or whatever

1526
01:05:00,480 --> 01:05:03,480
I don't know anything about fucking comic books at all

1527
01:05:03,480 --> 01:05:06,480
Our dad's backstage freaking out

1528
01:05:06,480 --> 01:05:09,480
The uh uh

1529
01:05:09,480 --> 01:05:16,480
Maybe this is a trap and you avoided it but I used to do that with like I would say wrong facts

1530
01:05:16,480 --> 01:05:18,480
Because I saw something remember that episode of News Radio

1531
01:05:18,480 --> 01:05:19,480
We're not gonna talk about News Radio right now

1532
01:05:19,480 --> 01:05:23,480
But one of the characters would lay out raw incorrect facts

1533
01:05:23,480 --> 01:05:25,480
And when someone would correct it they'd go

1534
01:05:25,480 --> 01:05:27,480
Aw geek jack I actually dig that a lot

1535
01:05:27,480 --> 01:05:29,480
So maybe this is a trap for do bros

1536
01:05:29,480 --> 01:05:33,480
Like uh actually it's Wolverine like yeah I know it's fucking Wolverine

1537
01:05:33,480 --> 01:05:34,480
And then they pull a tooth

1538
01:05:34,480 --> 01:05:35,480
Yeah

1539
01:05:35,480 --> 01:05:36,480
I knew it

1540
01:05:36,480 --> 01:05:44,480
Oh shit maybe they were just distracting you from the tooth tricks they were about to pull on you

1541
01:05:44,480 --> 01:05:47,480
By putting a little brain teaser in your like

1542
01:05:47,480 --> 01:05:50,480
Hey you know who I love is Golden Guy

1543
01:05:50,480 --> 01:05:53,480
And it's like Golden Guy who the fuck is Golden Guy

1544
01:05:53,480 --> 01:05:55,480
I don't even oh my tooth is gone

1545
01:05:55,480 --> 01:05:58,480
They're pretty sneaky Dennis

1546
01:05:58,480 --> 01:06:02,480
I would actually rather have a Dennis say that their favorite X-Man

1547
01:06:02,480 --> 01:06:05,480
Their favorite superhero is X-Man rather than Wolverine

1548
01:06:05,480 --> 01:06:10,480
Cause I'd just be like I don't know there's way more interesting superheroes than Wolverine

1549
01:06:10,480 --> 01:06:14,480
Is there his bones aren't real

1550
01:06:14,480 --> 01:06:17,480
Whoa

1551
01:06:17,480 --> 01:06:21,480
I'm gonna say Nightcrawler is better than Wolverine

1552
01:06:21,480 --> 01:06:25,480
Wolverine is like a thousand years old you hang on with Jesus

1553
01:06:25,480 --> 01:06:28,480
Nightcrawler is like a demon

1554
01:06:28,480 --> 01:06:35,480
Whoa Wolverine's got metal bones I can do that one twice it's so cool

1555
01:06:35,480 --> 01:06:36,480
Damn it

1556
01:06:36,480 --> 01:06:37,480
You're right

1557
01:06:37,480 --> 01:06:40,480
This is the greatest thing I've ever heard I'm so glad you didn't correct them

1558
01:06:40,480 --> 01:06:44,480
There's still so this is we get these gifts you've given us a gift

1559
01:06:44,480 --> 01:06:47,480
Because we will never meet this dentist probably

1560
01:06:47,480 --> 01:06:51,480
But I know that there's somebody out there who thinks Wolverine's name is X-Man

1561
01:06:51,480 --> 01:06:54,480
And while that may bring you worry for that person

1562
01:06:54,480 --> 01:06:57,480
It brings me a great amount of joy because they don't know any

1563
01:06:57,480 --> 01:07:01,480
They won't know any better until some dude bro does come in and smash through the window

1564
01:07:01,480 --> 01:07:05,480
But for now let's just celebrate the moment of X-Man

1565
01:07:05,480 --> 01:07:10,480
How does your dentist square away the knowledge that the name of the group is X-Men

1566
01:07:10,480 --> 01:07:12,480
Like it's X-Man and his X-Men

1567
01:07:12,480 --> 01:07:17,480
X-Man and his excellent X-Men

1568
01:07:17,480 --> 01:07:22,480
I mean they have out they do there is a band called Alvin and the Chipmunks

1569
01:07:22,480 --> 01:07:25,480
You ever fucking think about that that's actually really messed up

1570
01:07:25,480 --> 01:07:30,480
If you think about Alvin and uh we'll just name him by their species I guess I don't know

1571
01:07:30,480 --> 01:07:37,480
Also we're dumb asses there's a dude named Professor X

1572
01:07:37,480 --> 01:07:38,480
He is an X-Man

1573
01:07:38,480 --> 01:07:40,480
How is that any better than X-Man

1574
01:07:40,480 --> 01:07:42,480
It's not any better

1575
01:07:42,480 --> 01:07:43,480
Does that

1576
01:07:43,480 --> 01:07:45,480
Is that anything

1577
01:07:45,480 --> 01:07:46,480
Is that anything

1578
01:07:46,480 --> 01:07:48,480
I think it eases my conscience

1579
01:07:48,480 --> 01:07:51,480
Thank you that's the least we could do

1580
01:07:51,480 --> 01:07:54,480
Alright folks you can go ahead and drop the house lights down

1581
01:07:54,480 --> 01:07:57,480
We have got a wrap up for the evening

1582

I as the only non-founder can continue to thank the benevolent founders for gracing us

1589
01:08:25,480 --> 01:08:29,480
No seriously this is a really really cool event and it's really special

1590
01:08:29,480 --> 01:08:34,480
And I'm so glad that all these folks who I've listened to for a while have all gotten together

1591
01:08:34,480 --> 01:08:37,480
And I've gotten to hear them talk about smart things it's very cool

1592

When I look out at this crowd and think god every one of them is a podcast

1598
01:09:02,480 --> 01:09:07,480

1606
01:09:36,480 --> 01:09:39,480
And every year there's a thing called the empty stockings list

1607
01:09:39,480 --> 01:09:44,480
And it's a list the newspaper publishes full of people that just want to get maybe something for Christmas

1608
01:09:44,480 --> 01:09:48,480
A gift for a kid or a lot of times just basic necessities

Is that thing and if you could go there and you can buy a gift for someone that someone is asking for

1615
01:10:13,480 --> 01:10:17,480
