1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:30,720
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:46,800
Hello everybody, and welcome to My Brother, My Brother, and Me.

6
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:52,480
I'm your oldest brother, Justin Tyler McElroy. I'm your middle-est brother, Travis McElroy.

7
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:55,680
I'm your sweet baby brother and 30 under 30 media luminary, Griffin McElroy,

8
00:00:55,680 --> 00:01:01,840
and it's an advice show for the modern era. I don't know why Justin didn't say that this time.

9
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:08,160
Do you hear that, boys? Do you hear that, boys? When you hear hoofbeats, think derby! Not zebras.

10
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:10,720
Derby time!

11
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:16,720
It's derby time, everybody. Put on your cool hats. There's ribbons, and mine has two pinwheels.

12
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:20,960
I have created a little game out of the derby competitors. I have made

13
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:27,280
a list of names, sets of three. One name is real, two were made up. Griffin,

14
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:29,680
you're gonna go first. Tell me which of these names, now wait.

15
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:30,240
Two things.

16
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:34,880
We do have to give, like, do we, if we play this game with you, do we have to pay royalties?

17
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:36,240
We do have to give our dude money.

18
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:36,560
We do, yes.

19
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:40,720
Okay, the other thing is that I watched it, so like, I'm gonna fucking destroy you. So,

20
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:47,120
I like, watched it. I like, got a mia julep in my hand, and I drank it,

21
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:52,320
uh, drank it down smooth, and I got fucking blitzed, and I watched these griffonies go.

22
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:56,320
Combine the two worlds of the derby, Griffin, get a big wide-brimmed hat,

23
00:01:56,320 --> 00:02:02,800
right? And then tape two mint juleps to the sides of each side of the hat, and then you take a straw

24
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:03,280
down.

25
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:04,320
Two what?

26
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:10,480
Sorry, mint julep. And then have, like, big straws that come down to your mouth from the hat.

27
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:15,920
That's the only way to derby, um, just scientifically speaking.

28
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:17,760
All right, give me these fucking horses.

29
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:20,720
I want to talk about the derby more, so let's play Travis's game first.

30
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:23,360
Okay, which of these names is real? Griffin.

31
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,040
Thundersnow.

32
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:25,440
That's fake.

33
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:27,120
Earth, wind, and lightning.

34
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:27,600
That's fake.

35
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:29,440
Pants on fire.

36
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:30,320
None of those are real.

37
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:33,600
I'm sorry, Thundersnow is correct.

38
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:37,360
No, it wasn't. No, come on. It wasn't in the race. I watched the race, and there was no

39
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:38,320
Thundersnow.

40
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:41,920
It was Thundersnow. Thundersnow placed, let me see here.

41
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:48,320
Here, do-do-do-do-do, Thundersnow didn't do great 20th out of 20th.

42
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:51,600
Okay, here's my thing on horse racing, and I've got a whole bit that you guys are just

43
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:52,640
gonna love on this.

44
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:56,560
First place, you win. Your owner gets, like, a million dollars, and you get to bust, like,

45
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:58,240
the deepest nut ever that night.

46
00:02:58,240 --> 00:02:59,520
Congratulations.

47
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:03,120
Two, three, four, five, you get the wreath, and I guess your owner still gets a considerable

48
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:06,400
amount of money, but, like, you just get to bust a regular nut.

49
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:07,920
Five through ten, you're fine.

50
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:12,400
Anything after that, they should have, like, a collapsible pit that just opens up on the

51
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:17,920
track that all of the horses just fall down into, into, like, the pony pile, and then

52
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:21,280
the pit opens back up, and then we don't talk about those horses ever again.

53
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:25,520
Twentieth place, are you fucking kidding me? Twentieth place, 10th on the underground pile.

54
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:26,800
That's it. You're done.

55
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:28,880
I would own Thundersnow.

56
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:32,480
Listen, the owner of Thundersnow, if you're looking to get him off your hands, I'll take

57
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:32,640
it.

58
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:34,400
Travis, you don't have to own Thundersnow.

59
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:38,000
Thundersnow got thoroughly fucking owned yesterday in that race.

60
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:43,280
It got put in its place by fucking, what was the winner, Cream Dream, and I think Cream

61
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:44,560
Dream won it.

62
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:45,920
Was number one Cream Dream?

63
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:48,720
All right, Justin, which of these names is real?

64
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:52,480
Cream Dream, if Cream Dream is one of the three, it's real.

65
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:57,680
Justin, slow and steady, fast and accurate, sloppy boy.

66
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:00,560
All three describe me and sex.

67
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:03,680
I wish sloppy boy was real, but I think it's fast and accurate.

68
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:05,520
It is fast and accurate, that is correct.

69
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:07,200
That's a bullshit name for a horse.

70
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:08,880
Four legs and hooves.

71
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:11,520
It's like, what, long head and big body.

72
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:17,600
Griffin, pinch me, I'm dreaming, guaranteed winner, or state of honor.

73
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:19,440
State of honor is real.

74
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:21,040
State of honor is real.

75
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:22,240
I came in like third, I think.

76
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:23,760
I watched that one, I'm not kidding.

77
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:24,960
State of honor was fourth.

78
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:30,160
Oh, no, sorry, state of honor was, oh, no, state of honor was, no, no, no, no, no, no,

79
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:32,080
state of honor was 19th in the pile.

80
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:34,560
Travis, can we bring your game to an abrupt end?

81
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:37,920
But I have, okay, wait, let me give you this last one, Justin.

82
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:38,640
Okay, last one.

83
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:42,640
Williams, Steffaly, or Gervin.

84
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:44,640
Gervin.

85
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:45,680
Gervin is correct.

86
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:49,280
Welcome to my brother, my brother and me, I'm Gervin McElroy, I'm Steffaly.

87
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:56,000
Three of the, I pulled up the list after Travis's game was over.

88
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:03,040
And I, there are three different horses in this fucking race out of 20 or two or something.

89
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:06,880
There's three fucking horses that sound like someone trying to pronounce Gervin's name

90
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:07,440
and failing.

91
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:07,920
Gormley.

92
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:13,360
There is a, there's a Gervin, there's a Gunavera, and there's a Gormley.

93
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:15,040
Wait, is it Gormley McElroy?

94
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:15,920
No, it's not Gormley.

95
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:17,040
Gormley McCracken?

96
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:18,720
Gormley McCracken?

97
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:19,760
McCracken's another one, by the way.

98
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:25,040
I'm 30 under 30, Gormley, sweet cream dream McCracken.

99
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:25,520
McCracken.

100
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:30,320
It's Gormley McCracken, no, Gervin?

101
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:32,800
It's this great podcast, it's the McCracken brothers.

102
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:35,200
And the littlest one is such a card, Gorpels.

103
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:46,000
I celebrated the, I celebrated the derby, which was also free comic book day.

104
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:51,200
So I was downtown, stopped by Purple Earth, got some books, and I went to the press club

105
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:55,680
for lunch, which is like a, it's kind of like a bar restaurant kind of vibe.

106
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:56,480
So we're sitting there as-

107
00:05:56,480 --> 00:06:00,240
Stacey Panini's, hence the press in the name, you get it.

108
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:04,480
Yeah, there was two things about this.

109
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:09,200
One, it's buck wild that there's two hours of coverage for an event no one cares about

110
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:12,240
any other day of the year for 15 seconds of event.

111
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:12,800
That's fine.

112
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:18,640
To fill that, one of the segments I saw was, you know, there's celebrities here,

113
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:26,160
and they're like, here are the celebrities, Harry Connick Jr., Travis Tritt, end of montage.

114
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:31,040
That was like, whoa, a rough year for the derb.

115
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:38,480
But as we're the only people in the restaurant, as we are like waiting for the race to begin,

116
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:42,480
I mean, we're not, we're eating pizza, but like the race was about to begin,

117
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:47,440
an elderly gentleman comes in and just stands at the bar, staring at the screen,

118
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:49,440
gets himself a beer, drains it.

119
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:53,360
And as the race begins, he just starts yelling, come on.

120
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:55,600
Like that will make the race-

121
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:56,240
Come on!

122
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:58,800
Like that'll make the race begin faster or-

123
00:06:58,800 --> 00:06:59,360
Come on!

124
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:02,320
No, as the race has begun, he's yelling, come on.

125
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:05,120
But he's not mentioning any horses.

126
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:10,480
So it gives him the vibe of like, he's just trying to be encouraging.

127
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:14,000
Like he just wants all the horses to come on a bit faster.

128
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:14,800
He wants a good race, yeah.

129
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:16,640
He just wants a good race out there.

130
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:17,920
Important question.

131
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:24,080
At the end of the race, did he pull some sort of paper stub out of perhaps a breast pocket,

132
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:26,160
tear it up and jump up and down on it?

133
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:27,120
No, that's the-

134
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:29,440
Okay, this is the other thing.

135
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:32,080
When the race is over, no reaction.

136
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:35,520
Like he, I guess he's just in it for speed.

137
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:39,360
He just loves the speed or something, because he did not care who won or lost.

138
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:40,720
He just wanted her to come on.

139
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:46,400
Maybe he just, he really likes watching, or like he is committed to watching the derby,

140
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:48,320
but doesn't actually enjoy doing it.

141
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:53,200
And like, he just knows like, maybe there's a group of people at work who always talk about the derby.

142
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:54,880
And he's like, I'm going to watch it this year.

143
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:57,680
But as soon as he started, it was like, I already hate this.

144
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:00,560
Come on, please just finish it.

145
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:02,320
Finish it.

146
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:05,120
So yeah, derby.

147
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:07,200
Derby again, derby time.

148
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:09,120
Congratulations to Cream Dreams.

149
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:11,840
Congratulations to Cream Dreams, the winner.

150
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:13,840
That's not the name, that's not-

151
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:18,000
Just Googled about Thundersnow, injury on the track, muddy.

152
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:24,160
I said, this track will, this race will have at least one horse destruction by the end of the day.

153
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:24,960
You listen to me.

154
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:31,120
Thundersnow had a bad buck coming out the paddock, and I was sure, I was almost certain.

155
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:35,360
But no, he said, put that fucking gun away, Jeremy.

156
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:36,880
Not to me, I'm Thundersnow.

157
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:39,360
I'm too proud, and so I think he's okay.

158
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:40,400
Scary moment, though.

159
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:46,480
You see a horse take a bad break out the paddock, and you think, like, is this it for our hero Thundersnow?

160
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:54,480
One of the horses was named after an issue we've had while recording the show before, and it's called J-Boy's Echo.

161
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:58,960
Sometimes J-Boy does get a little bit of echo from the headphones.

162
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:04,240
J-Boy's Echo has been an issue that we've had to negate with some audio VST plug-in.

163
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:08,640
There's another horse here named after another issue that we have on the show, and it's called I-Rap.

164
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:13,840
And my name is Griffin, and I'm here to say that I love these horses in a major way.

165
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:16,320
I wish there could just be a 20-way tie.

166
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:21,280
I wish all these horses could finish at the same time, and they could all just bust all their nuts that night.

167
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:27,440
I will say, Griffin, when I first saw that the derby hit occurred, the headline I read was,

168
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:30,880
Always Dreaming Takes First on a Sloppy Track.

169
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:38,160
They said Always Dreaming in the headline because they can't, like, our fucking, our news, quote-unquote,

170
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:42,240
papers, that's, one doesn't get quotes because it is on paper.

171
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:45,600
They're too fucking chicken shit to say Cream Dream in a headline.

172
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:46,880
They're too chicken shit to put that on the-

173
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:52,160
Well, they changed the attribute one to Always Creaming, because now he just gets to bust nuts, lips, and rights.

174
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:54,400
It's good work if you can get it.

175
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:56,960
Ah, ha-chi-chi-chi.

176
00:09:58,960 --> 00:09:59,920
Sex.

177
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:03,600
Uh, so anyway, derby, it's got horses, we gotta talk about it.

178
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:04,560
That's the law.

179
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:06,960
Let's, but, but that's not all we do here on the show.

180
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:10,320
We help people, and we give them advice to help them.

181
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:17,520
And I'd like to do that right now with our first question, and, uh, here we go.

182
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:22,320
At dinner with my in-laws the other night, I found out about a vacation package they had purchased off the internet,

183
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:25,600
and were inviting myself and my SO to join them on.

184
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:30,320
A simple Google search led me to find the package was likely a scam,

185
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:34,320
and that the company behind it had a long list of scam complaints in the past.

186
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:35,200
Oof.

187
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:39,360
My question, though, is what's the best way to tell a friend or loved one that they have been scammed

188
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:42,960
without making them feel stupid or angry or ruining their vacation?

189
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:48,880
I feel guilty for not telling them, but also don't want them to go on their vacation and let them get scammed anyway.

190
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:52,800
That's from scammed by scoundrels and scoundrels in Sydney.

191
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:58,560
Unless I missed a factor here, I don't think they're gonna go on said vacation.

192
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:07,120
Unless it's a weird scam I'm not aware of where the person both gets scammed but also gets to go to Hawaii.

193
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:12,800
It's nice. One of these where they send you a picture of a boat, and they're like 10,000 bucks,

194
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:18,400
and we'll take you on the cruise of your life, and you show up, and it's just a big picture of a boat.

195
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:21,200
And Captain Ron is there, but like...

196
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:25,440
Captain Ron's there, but he's there to just like take some pictures with you with this good boat picture,

197
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:28,400
and he says, yeah, I hope it was worth it.

198
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:29,520
And it kind of is.

199
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:31,360
It kind of is. He's great.

200
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:35,760
This is... I mean, you got to say something. You don't want them showing up and getting...

201
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:38,880
Well, but think about it this way. How do you say to them, like,

202
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:44,240
without sounding like you're saying, hey, stupids, I looked this up. Why didn't you look this up?

203
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:48,560
This is a scam. It took me five seconds to figure out, even if that's not your tone of voice,

204
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:53,200
which, God help me, it should not. But like, there's no way to say like, hey,

205
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:58,160
a brief Google search let me know that y'all been taken.

206
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:04,320
Well, I think that's probably better than, well, we'll be taking your house now. Goodbye.

207
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:08,480
Like, I think that they would prefer to hear from you about the scam

208
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:13,600
rather than, like, you don't own your home anymore. I think they would prefer that, right?

209
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:21,440
Ooh, what about... Do you have a certain set of skills that will help you to save your in-laws

210
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:26,720
from the scam taken for? Taken... It's a very low stakes taken.

211
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:30,160
Yes. You didn't even... How did you even

212
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:35,920
get here without Googling it accidentally? Cooltrips.biz. Sounds good to me. 800,000?

213
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:41,520
Here you go. I'll take out a second mortgage. Here you go. Where are we going? That's not important.

214
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:46,800
Don't worry about it. It says, fun trip for four. Good for me. Where to? Not important.

215
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:51,680
Amazing Write style, baby. Cue it up, Phil. Cue it up, Phil Keegan. Let's do this shit.

216
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:57,200
When I worked at Best Buy and we would like ask people if they wanted to sign up for credit

217
00:12:57,200 --> 00:13:02,960
cards and stuff for the story, like, part of it was we needed your social security number.

218
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:09,120
And there is a certain generation, I'm not going to say 100% in time, but that is more statistically

219
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:17,200
likely to both be very wary of people in uniforms at a store they're standing in asking for their

220
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:24,560
social security number, who will also give away whatever information you want for a trip to the

221
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:26,560
Bahamas or a boat or whatever. Yeah.

222
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:33,120
I don't know what the disc... But like, hi, you see my face. I'm standing behind a Best Buy desk.

223
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:38,160
Can I have your... No, no, no. I don't trust that. Okay. Ooh, a flashing window popped up on my

224
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:42,720
computer. Don't mind if I do. Now, I'll punch the fuck out of this monkey. Wait, you're going to

225
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:47,840
give me a cruise too? Oh, shit. Just for punching the monkey? Fuck yeah. Just punched the monkey

226
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:54,320
once? Internet's great. I hate to do this, guys, but at this point, I'm going to have to bring it

227
00:13:54,320 --> 00:14:04,000
up. The grifter's code. Now, here's the problem. Ah, shit. If you are running... If you here tell

228
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:08,480
about a grift and it sets off your alarm bells, and if you've been in the game for a while,

229
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:17,040
you know them all. The back alley preacher, the... The Corvin. The Corvin, the seven watches.

230
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:22,720
The sloppy boy. The creamy... The thunder snow. The bubblegum violin. You know all of the grifts.

231
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:30,080
The Arkansas creamy dream. I think if you detect a grift and then you alert the grift,

232
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:36,400
you have got to be prepared for the next time you're running a grift. Call full circle. Oh,

233
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:40,640
they're coming for you. Big wheel keeps spinning. In a major way. Keep spinning that big wheel.

234
00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:46,960
Ooh. Yeah. What if you... Oh, no. I'm trying to think of the name of the show. What's the show?

235
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:54,720
Is it collateral? No. Collaboral. That's it. Where you grift the grifter. Oh, shit. It's

236
00:14:54,720 --> 00:15:02,400
collateral. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. You reverse grift. Yeah. You need a... You need a captain for your

237
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:09,760
boat? Yeah, I guess so. How much money? $20,000. Are you a very good captain? You know it. You

238
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:12,960
know I'm the best captain. Best in the biz. You're not going to find a captain for cheaper

239
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:17,200
than the exact amount of money my in-laws... I mean, someone's in... I mean, those two

240
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:24,960
marks gave you. It's a little bit of lingo. The show is Leverage. I'm very mad at myself

241
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:30,320
that I couldn't pull Leverage. I love that show. I know for a fact the creator of Leverage has

242
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:34,560
listened to our products before, and I'm very sorry we couldn't pull the name of Leverage.

243
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:38,080
Sorry we called your show Collaboral. It's definitely not that.

244
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:50,800
Um, it's just... Oh my goodness. Is it Derby time? I want a mod squad! I thought we were doing

245
00:15:50,800 --> 00:16:03,840
other stuff. I want two mods squad. Bunch of people sent this one in, and I am really excited

246
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:09,360
about it, and I think that if you've been paying... A lot more people are paying attention to the

247
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:15,200
scene than they were before. Quick question. Is it these horrible triangles?

248
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:27,920
The horrible triangles sound pretty tasty right now. I have a side path real quick. KFC has a

249
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:33,680
romance novel from Mother's Day called Tender Wings of Desire. Very funny. You're definitely

250
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:39,360
going to want to pick that one up. Literal? Wait. The sentence I said is true, parse it later.

251
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:50,640
Moving on, naked chicken is back! Naked chicken has become a brand of the Taco Bell hive mind,

252
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:55,600
and the only odd thing about that is the name was incepted for the naked chicken chalupa,

253
00:16:55,600 --> 00:17:02,080
which of course was chicken instead of a shell, so the naked thing made sense.

254
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:10,160
But now they're twisting it a little bit with naked chicken chips. It's like all three of

255
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:19,840
those fucking words. You've modified it. Go on. I'm so excited because I have... Which has become

256
00:17:19,840 --> 00:17:24,080
a rarity. A lot of these companies are not putting out these press releases anymore. I think they

257
00:17:24,080 --> 00:17:30,720
onto me. That's fine. But this one does have a big release. I'm really excited because this is

258
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:37,440
May 11th this is happening. My big release do you mean diarrhea? Here's the first slide of this

259
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:43,840
press release. Taco Bell went and did it again. Yes! I agree! That sentence should be preceded by

260
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:52,240
uh oh. Taco Bell went and did it again. First, they created a taco shell made entirely of crispy

261
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:57,680
marinated white meat chicken. Now they've done the same with chips complete with here's an adjective

262
00:17:57,680 --> 00:18:04,640
you never knew existed and now wish you could put it away. Dippable nacho cheese sauce. Dippable

263
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:14,560
nacho cheese. Consider the inverse. Undippable nacho cheese sauce. Unpenetratable. It's straight

264
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:19,360
cheesy oobleck. It fucking like as much force as you can put into this thing it's gonna push

265
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:28,080
right the fuck back. Now with unfathomable nacho cheese. Just try to plumb the depths of this nacho

266
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:33,600
cheese. I'd like to welcome back to the show uh a woman I've come to think of as the fourth

267
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:39,600
McElroy brother Marissa Thalberg chief marketing officer at Taco Bell uh who says quote the

268
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:46,320
the world wasn't ready to say goodbye to naked chicken and neither were we.

269
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:53,520
Thank you Marissa Thalberg for interrupting my grieving process. The world's grieving and you've

270
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:58,560
you've righted the ship just when you thought it couldn't get any better. That word doesn't mean

271
00:18:58,560 --> 00:19:04,560
what I think it means anymore. We went and added our famous nacho cheese to expose the traditional

272
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:11,040
chips and cheese combo like only Taco Bell can. The word is expose that Marissa has chosen this

273
00:19:11,040 --> 00:19:16,960
time we're exposing chips and cheese to this fucking radioactive concept of naked chicken.

274
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:25,920
These are I'm sorry triangular chicken wedges right these are these are nuggets of a sort that

275
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:33,600
are maybe it sounds like maybe breaded embarrassed with Dorito fixins and you just dip them in nacho.

276
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:40,640
So these are chicken tenders that are triangular and no I don't want to get it I think to me

277
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:46,800
I I'm not interested in talking about like fucking BuzzFeed runs a post saying like a hot dog's a

278
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:51,280
sandwich and then everybody just gets really angry about it for a long time. I don't want to get into

279
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:56,240
that sort of semantic argument. These are chicken tenders and no making something triangle shape

280
00:19:56,240 --> 00:20:01,840
does not make it a chip. That is the most wack shit I've ever heard. There's only one way in which

281
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:06,240
it is a chip Griffin and that is literally if they just took like fried chicken skin

282
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:16,720
and there's no meat whatsoever. I'm gonna I'm gonna yards now. There's um part of this press

283
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:22,160
release which I'm not gonna get in the prices let me say these chips are extremely affordable

284
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:27,600
in the monetary sense. I need I need to know the prices I'm sorry. Six piece for $1.99 or 12 piece

285
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:34,640
for $3.99. That's not getting a deal if you get 12. Um sorry. Um one of those things especially is

286
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:40,480
that uh is this paragraph. Naked chicken isn't the only thing that's back. The council for eating

287
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:45,600
fried chicken the same way you always have. A group dedicated to the preservation of traditional

288
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:49,760
chicken values. The first surface during the launch of the naked chicken chalupa have already

289
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:55,120
begun their marketing campaign against naked chicken chips. What is this? Which they deem equally as

290
00:20:55,120 --> 00:21:01,920
bold and dangerously delicious. This is of course a fake thing that Taco Bell yeah yeah yeah yeah

291
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:08,560
it's a fake thing that Taco Bell made up of like people who are a fake group who's like thinks that

292
00:21:08,560 --> 00:21:14,160
this is the road to hell is paved with fried chicken in different shapes. I which is of course

293
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:19,920
a joke and it's it's marketing and whatever but I do think it reveals something of the Taco Bell

294
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:27,520
psyche that like on some level they know they have to create their own Moriarty. Like they do

295
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:33,440
like no one's stopping us and the guilt that we feel is actually manifested in us creating an

296
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:41,040
anti-Taco Bell. Like we're paying money for an anti-Taco Bell to nip at our heels at every turn.

297
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:48,320
This is so that when we do things like this and we talk about it that they can be like well yeah

298
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:54,080
of course they're part of the council and then everybody can just discount our statements.

299
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:57,760
They could have saved a lot of money by bringing me in to be the counter Taco Bell and be like

300
00:21:57,760 --> 00:22:02,080
Griffin McElroy in the press was like Griffin McElroy of my brother my brother and me in 30

301
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:07,440
under 30 media luminary said this sounds fucking nasty and I don't know why Taco Bell you think

302
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:14,400
you are going to become my my number one chicken source. You all don't know fucking anything about

303
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:19,520
this chicken game and to be honest if this is the heat you're bringing dippable nacho cheese sauce

304
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:25,040
with little triangles that have probably been a flavor of over blasted with whatever seasoning

305
00:22:25,040 --> 00:22:31,040
you're bringing to the table. I think it sounds pretty nasty Griffin said. Hey fuck that guy come

306
00:22:31,040 --> 00:22:36,960
come get these little guys. Can I actually like I know that you made up the council for eating fried

307
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:42,720
chicken the same way you always have as a joke but like can I join that? Can I donate lots of

308
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:47,760
money to the can I give like 10 percent of my paycheck to the good chicken council? Yeah can

309
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:54,160
we just do that is there are there groups like I always thought family values groups were horseshit

310
00:22:54,160 --> 00:23:00,160
growing up and broadly speaking yes yes they are absolutely yes obviously but if there are groups

311
00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:06,880
devoted to the values of eating chicken in not fun shapes like I would probably join up I would

312
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:13,280
probably get on board with that if it was a feasible organization. Do you all want to Yahoo?

313
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:18,640
Yes yeah yeah I do Griffin and while you're doing that I'm going to run a quick who is on this

314
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:23,280
chicken council try to figure out oh shit who is who's bankrolling the whole thing.

315
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:31,920
Fucking WikiLeaks over here getting at it getting at the code. Yeah this one was sent in by Tristan

316
00:23:31,920 --> 00:23:37,760
Hyatt thank you Tristan it's Yahoo Answers user anonymous we're gonna call him Reggie asks

317
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:46,880
weird question how do you shop at Foot Locker? Yeah I've never understood it. Where do they

318
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:52,080
keep the actual shoes? Do you have to talk to an employee? I hope this question doesn't seem dumb

319
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:57,920
lol I've kind of been in one for like two minutes felt out of place I saw a few boxes but I just

320
00:23:57,920 --> 00:24:06,560
left after that. This is this is a this is a valuable service because I there have been lots

321
00:24:06,560 --> 00:24:12,080
of times. Juice you remember when it was Trav's and yours birthdays coming up and we wanted to

322
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:19,200
get him a present and so we went to the vitamin store to buy him some vitamins and we got said

323
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:24,080
we got said get out of here they said you don't have any money or more or less this is not a

324
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:28,160
jokey joke somebody said this is a store where all the things are pretty expensive and Justin

325
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:33,360
you had that Olive Garden money and you were like oh yeah guess you don't want these OG bucks

326
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:36,720
and then we left the store and we felt like really huffy and superior for the rest of the day. You

327
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:42,000
just made a big mistake huge. Huge mistake I was gonna buy all the protein for my brother as a

328
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:46,880
birthday gift. What did you end up getting me just the walk down memory lane do y'all remember or?

329
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:52,640
No but I mean okay you know how you're all like fucking scrawny and shriveled up now like these

330
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:57,520
days. That is my defining feature how tiny I am. You're all fucking tiny and wispy and weak and

331
00:24:57,520 --> 00:25:01,760
it's because we weren't able to buy you these pills that you needed to get yoked but anyway.

332
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:06,560
Ah man two paths diverged you know what I mean? And you took the one. Ah sliding doors. You took

333
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:11,520
the one of just like a little tiny like a baby's body but anyway how do you shop a full-on like

334
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:17,520
a welcome to Weinerville body. Like a Weinerville situation. I just think that there's lots of

335
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:21,600
discomfort about going into certain stores to shop. I feel it when I go into J Crew because

336
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:26,720
it's a one echelon level higher than the clothes store that I usually shop at and I feel like I'm

337
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:30,960
gonna embarrass myself in there and obviously this person's struggling at Foot Locker so I think we

338
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:36,720
could do a little Prima strategy guide a little game facts for Foot Locker. What I find interesting

339
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:41,440
about this question Griffin is that Reggie's concern is like the actual mechanics. Yeah.

340
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:46,560
Whereas my my embarrassment when I walk into Foot Locker is like I don't know how to ask where like

341
00:25:46,560 --> 00:25:51,600
the shoes for sitting around and not playing sports are. They got them they got them they got

342
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:56,160
all kinds of they got fashion they got casual they got all kinds of stuff. I'm just so afraid to ask

343
00:25:56,160 --> 00:26:01,760
because I'm afraid I'll walk in and they'll be like you don't sport and I'll just run out crying.

344
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:07,280
No no no no that's a common misconception this is page one of the strategy guide it's just like

345
00:26:07,280 --> 00:26:10,800
be confident I think when you walk in there like it doesn't matter what you need these shoes for

346
00:26:10,800 --> 00:26:18,400
Foot Locker's gotcha. Now Griffin they are also dressed I believe the sporting term is referees.

347
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:21,760
So it's just number two in the like page two in the strategy guide like don't be they're not

348
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:26,880
gonna call some sort of foul on you can you imagine? Okay that's that's what I was worried

349
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:31,360
about that I come in and I'd be like um I don't know my size and they're like that's a red card

350
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:36,320
you're out of here. Yeah yeah that's a sports thing. Um Juice are you still counter programming

351
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:42,320
the Taco Bell website or are you in the bit with us? No I'm here in the bit I just I I just don't

352
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:47,040
have much to add about the last time I was in a Foot Locker they had some shoes in glass cases.

353
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:51,120
Okay. That's not a joke and you could like read about them. So like number three is like don't

354
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:54,880
get freaked out when you see that like I'd be afraid if I saw that that I was going to

355
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:59,360
accidentally steal some shoes from Foot Locker and it's like just don't you know it's not a museum

356
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:02,880
you're not robbing it. Sometimes you have to say that to people like when they're shopping in a

357
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:06,800
store like sometimes I walk into Best Buy and I think like I hope I don't actually steal some I

358
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:09,680
you know I don't want to be I don't want to accidentally steal something here.

359
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:13,600
Yeah you want to on purpose steal things. Well I want to make the decision yeah.

360
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:20,560
Yeah no Travis knows how hard the LP is at Best Buy they've got eyes on everybody I wouldn't try

361
00:27:20,560 --> 00:27:24,240
to sneak out of that place with anything. Yeah like I like if I was shoplifting from Best Buy

362
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:31,440
and I saw Travis's little Wienerville baby body I'd be like oh no. That's fair. Um just looks like

363
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:38,560
five five broomsticks. It is easy though to steal shoes from the Foot Locker because all you do is

364
00:27:38,560 --> 00:27:43,440
you go into the changing room and then you put on the new shoes and you put your old shoes back

365
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:47,120
in the box and then you say like I you know I decided I don't want these and you just walk out.

366
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:51,280
Jesus Travis this is a strategy guide for how to shop at Foot Locker and you just told people

367
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:56,160
go for it basically. I think it's safe though because I don't actually think they have changing

368
00:27:56,160 --> 00:28:02,480
rooms to change your shoes so you I might have given some bogus advice there. Griffin let me

369
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:06,320
ask you a different question for the strategy guide. How do you shop at Foot Locker? Well I've

370
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:13,040
been in the Foot Locker and I've seen basketball hoops. Oh yeah. Like is there any risk of a game

371
00:28:13,040 --> 00:28:17,840
breaking out that I would have to participate in? Um I mean it would be pretty loud like the sound

372
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:21,840
of a basketball being dribbled is like pretty loud so like you wouldn't you I think you'd have

373
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:24,960
enough time to probably get out of the store but again take those shoes off you don't want to

374
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:31,200
um thief from them. How do you get the shoes that are right for you at Foot Locker though?

375
00:28:32,800 --> 00:28:38,240
Because like what's a good fit I think for like a Reebok? Well that I actually do know the answer

376
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:44,720
to Griffin because here's the thing the only people who work at Foot Locker are passionate

377
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:51,120
about shoe sales. They love it. So if you go up to any one of them and say I don't even know what

378
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:57,440
I'm looking for I am a blank canvas upon which you can paint your masterpiece they are going to

379
00:28:58,160 --> 00:29:04,160
love the opportunity to really stretch their imaginations and their creativity to find the

380
00:29:04,160 --> 00:29:10,000
right shoe for you. They'll take care of everything you just have a seat and no matter what questions

381
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:15,760
they ask you say surprise me. And I think that's probably the best way to buy don't even tell them

382
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:20,640
your shoe size let them figure that out because that's going to make their whole day. Now Juice

383
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:25,600
I've got a question here from somebody about Foot Locker and I was hoping you could help

384
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:35,520
them answer it and it's an anonymous ask.fm and they said that they always have stinky feet

385
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:44,240
and so like they don't want to offend any of the umpires or whatever and so they just asked they

386
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:50,480
said Justin what do I do about that? Just measure yourself ask if they have a booklet about how to

387
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:54,800
work that little slide thing okay and then just sit there for a half hour and piece it together

388
00:29:54,800 --> 00:29:59,120
yourself. That's going to take a while though I mean it's it will I don't want to make a day of it

389
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:04,320
they'll give they'll bring you a cold drink if it takes too long to figure out your shoe size. Do

390
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:08,160
you think you need you need to pack your lunch yourself though? Yeah do pack a lunch. Does

391
00:30:08,160 --> 00:30:13,280
anybody own those at home and they come in and like put your foot in the scale and then you

392
00:30:13,280 --> 00:30:17,760
could say to them like don't worry about it I used my foot scale at home and I'll tell you exactly

393
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:23,520
the size it is. Do you think they're on Amazon because like the problem boys is you're dealing

394
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:29,680
with like a cubit situation where the scale at Payless is different from the scale every store

395
00:30:29,680 --> 00:30:36,320
has their own shoe sizes. Well that's how they and that's how they fuck you right? Yeah um I can't

396
00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:41,600
understand sort of where this person was coming from because if you go there and you just see one

397
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:46,320
shoe on a shelf you certainly are gonna wonder like well what do I do about that? There's no

398
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:51,760
I well I mean I'm what so wait is there another one behind if I take one out will another one

399
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:56,800
just slide into its place like a cook machine? Like no it's that's obviously the most popular

400
00:30:56,800 --> 00:31:01,920
fashionable shoe that everybody's wearing and you fucking buy that shoe and you shut up about it

401
00:31:01,920 --> 00:31:05,440
because you don't know that much about shoes obviously if you're having this much trouble with

402
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:10,640
it you just got to trust the people at Foot Locker because this is their passion. Now Griffin what

403
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:16,640
if the shoe is just way too big for you but it is the last one of the most popular shoe? Jam it in

404
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:24,480
jam it up like maybe put some like rolled up socks in there or or toilet paper or tissue paper or

405
00:31:26,560 --> 00:31:29,920
do they make you get rid of your off-court buddies in that circumstance or

406
00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:33,840
I mean they make you trade in your shoes if you buy shoes at Foot Locker no matter

407
00:31:34,560 --> 00:31:37,520
what you knew that right that's how they get that's how they get new ones

408
00:31:37,520 --> 00:31:43,840
the the the foot measuring thing is called the Brannock device fuck yeah that's awesome it's

409
00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:50,320
awesome it's really cool uh you can buy one on Amazon for $65 that's way more money than I would

410
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:56,320
ever as a joke spend on anything okay yeah you can but I'm trying to figure out why yeah like

411
00:31:57,680 --> 00:32:04,400
if you were gonna start a shoe place is this the last thing like we are about to open the doors

412
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:10,720
you're like oh fuck need you know what tell me they got same day tell me because we gotta get

413
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:21,600
gotta get it I'm 30 I don't and that still feels just awful it tumbled that word just

414
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:29,360
diapers out of my mouth um but I do think that my feet are probably done growing huh

415
00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:35,760
uh-huh probably are about to start shrinking I don't think my feet are gonna get any huh

416
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:41,280
there are 10 there are 10 after 30 they shrink they're 10 now I don't think I'm ever gonna hit

417
00:32:41,280 --> 00:32:50,640
10.5 uh I'm a see I'm like a 10.5 11 I do like it but I'm 12 Travis is a two

418
00:32:51,680 --> 00:32:58,560
I'm a 12 d it's just a broomstick going into a shoe I know because I wear cowboy boots sir

419
00:32:58,560 --> 00:33:05,920
and I wear the shit out of them yeah he's very proud of his boots um hey hey boots aren't cheap

420
00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:10,800
that's what they tell me at least I hear that they're expensive you want a nice pair wouldn't

421
00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:14,640
be funny if I know you're doing the transition but wouldn't be funny if you went to footlocker

422
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:22,880
and they saw your shoes and they were like what are those I love I love that one because they're

423
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:30,640
like it's just shoes and it's like fun to like slam people for it I think if I were if I had a

424
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:37,040
footlocker if I owned a footlocker I would tell my employees whenever somebody came in the store

425
00:33:37,040 --> 00:33:43,360
I would tell them to say well you already have shoes what's your what's your angle what are you

426
00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:47,760
playing at you already got them four who are these four they have to come in here if they want our

427
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:55,440
shoes no shoes sold unless the person is present you know that but if you came in without shoes

428
00:33:55,440 --> 00:34:00,720
they'd be like they're ready they're ready they're ready to receive we've been waiting for you we saw

429
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:05,920
you coming they come in and I'd be like what are those oh he doesn't have them you got you've

430
00:34:06,560 --> 00:34:13,120
you've solved my joke I would like a Mr. Magorium's Wonder Emporium but for shoes it was just

431
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:18,240
fucking magical but at the end you just end up with shoes I don't know I haven't seen it

432
00:34:19,840 --> 00:34:26,960
it might be about shoes I'll spoil it for you uh Mr. Magorium dies and turns into Stardust I guess

433
00:34:28,160 --> 00:34:34,880
I didn't see it either but I got really into it conceptually so I read the plot summary uh all

434
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:41,760
right I'm gonna try this again boots are expensive money zone these boots are made for walking to the

435
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:56,800
money zone there we go that's fine I'm very excited to speak because my brother my brother

436
00:34:56,800 --> 00:35:02,960
me is sponsored by Lyft and I love Lyft for a lot of reasons it's a very versatile service

437
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:09,360
that I'm a fan of one when I travel if I go somewhere like uh San Francisco Sketch Fest

438
00:35:09,360 --> 00:35:16,160
right I don't want to rent a car boom Lyft is right there super convenient two Teresa and I

439
00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:21,360
share a car if I want to make sure my wife still has access to our car and I just need to like

440
00:35:21,360 --> 00:35:26,880
run to an appointment or something boom Lyft does it bum you out Travis at all that this is a sort

441
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:30,320
of unrequited love because you tried to be a Lyft driver once and they didn't want you

442
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:38,080
no that was fair because I did have a number of infractions you want you want standards they

443
00:35:38,080 --> 00:35:43,680
won't let Travis drive to pay him money to talk about their service well they might now I think

444
00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:48,800
a lot of those infractions have probably fallen off of my record Travis tried out for the team

445
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:56,240
tried out for the Lyft team Lyft said no but we'll find some way to use you you you enthusiastic

446
00:35:56,240 --> 00:36:02,400
young driver they they saw something raw in Travis that they could mold you you're not a driver

447
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:10,160
you're a speaker and they were right speak for Lyft um I I do honestly god I use Lyft all the

448
00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:16,000
time uh and I I'm a pretty big fan um safety is their number one priority every driver is

449
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:20,480
fully vetted through a 10 point safety standard including third-party criminal and dmv background

450
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:25,600
checks how many points you think you made it third trap if you were to guess maybe two honestly

451
00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:31,200
I cleaned my car really good and I had peppermints yeah and that's one and two those are the two

452
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:35,600
first safety standard points and the third one is like I had an iPhone charge cable

453
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:40,800
all right well that one's important too they can't have you can't have your maps dying

454
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:48,080
whoo that was close um nine out of ten Lyft rides get a perfect five star rating

455
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:52,560
and and they offer a better experience with Lyft you can tip in the app so the happier

456
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:58,640

462
00:37:27,520 --> 00:37:33,360
brother any any shitty old brother hey can I tell you about pro can I tell about pro flowers

463
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:38,480
yeah please we got some lovely blooms in well we didn't they weren't even blooming yet that's the

464
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:43,280
best thing we got these lovely little these plants essentially and then I put the dust in the water

465
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:47,760
they send you the dust and they say put the dust in the water and you cut some of the flowers and

466
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:51,840
I feel bad doing that every time like you're supposed to cut their butts off basically I

467
00:37:51,840 --> 00:37:56,400
guess it helps them drink up the dust better but anyway they bloomed and we've had them for a while

468
00:37:56,400 --> 00:38:01,200
now and they're just lovely they're sitting on the kitchen and I just like to sometimes I turn

469
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:08,080
the tv off and I say babe it's I'm talking to Rachel and her baby and I say babes it's flower

470
00:38:08,080 --> 00:38:15,760
night and we'll just look right at these things for two three four five six seven eight hours at a

471
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:25,440
time nine hours yesterday I'm thinking of it nine hours yesterday you know in the 30s that's what

472
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:30,000
I had to pass for entertainment your your grandparents probably stared at flowers well

473
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:34,800
you would finish your dance marathon and you wanted to just chill out for the night and you're

474
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:39,440
like I can't dance another marathon dancing your dance marathon and they would open the pool up

475
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:44,560
under you and you'd fall into it every time that's every dance marathon they don't tell you that

476
00:38:44,560 --> 00:38:47,840
that's every dance marathon you fall in the pool and then you walk home with your future wife and

477
00:38:47,840 --> 00:38:51,600
then you get home and you just stare at some flowers and so somebody would go to turn the radio

478
00:38:51,600 --> 00:38:55,920
on and he would slap their hand away from the dial as hard as you possibly could and you say no because

479
00:38:55,920 --> 00:39:00,640
it would interrupt flower watching but also that would attract uh the bombers they would know where

480
00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:05,840
you are because of the radio signal but again to keep that turned off it's flower night mama may

481
00:39:05,840 --> 00:39:12,000
I be excused from the table to go stir the flowers well jeff rooms did you finish your turkey leather

birthing my brothers and me love your jelly i see you didn't want to take the director's note at the

505
00:41:16,960 --> 00:41:22,480
beginning of this one juice i'm not a fucking dancing it says if snowden could come out of

506
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:26,720
hiding to read this message that'd be great and like i don't know why you want him to compromise

507
00:41:26,720 --> 00:41:37,760
himself for for for you give us one justin just one word thank you for birthing me mother it's

508
00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:43,440
our secret i feel like maybe you've lost much like still fucking there much like the american

509
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:48,320
intelligence community you've lost snowden maybe a little bit he just sounds smaller

510
00:41:49,360 --> 00:41:54,720
i hate see i hate this happening inorganic you can do it i'm an or this is i'm an organic

511
00:41:54,720 --> 00:42:01,360
comedian yeah i did it it was so funny people are walling their brains off right now they're

512
00:42:01,360 --> 00:42:09,760
loving it just like the kids say snowden fever is back and it's sweeping america and there's

513
00:42:09,760 --> 00:42:14,960
a reason i sometimes you retire a beloved character because you lose touch with them

514
00:42:14,960 --> 00:42:20,960
it's like if um you know the guy who hosts uh all american actor sit down james spader

515
00:42:20,960 --> 00:42:27,120
if he were to say to me justin can i speak with edward snowden the worst thing that's ever

516
00:42:27,120 --> 00:42:30,400
happening by the way is watching james lefton hosted inside of the actor's studio with the

517
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:36,160
cast of simpsons and uh asking each one in turn if he could speak to their character

518
00:42:36,160 --> 00:42:43,920
and having them improvise some like simpson's back and forth uh uh uh impromptu discussions

519
00:42:43,920 --> 00:42:48,640
with the simpson's family and just one of them look at them like it's scripted james

520
00:42:48,640 --> 00:42:54,480
james show is scripted hey james can i can i speak to mo man

535
00:44:24,560 --> 00:44:29,840
plan whether bailey's gonna be in dc or the ukraine when this message is read considering it is a

536
00:44:29,840 --> 00:44:35,280
month oh no two months late that's not really a good i don't know if that's a good joke for them

though self-burn you guys are really here how about this how about this okay tell me a joke

538
00:44:41,360 --> 00:44:47,520

00:44:47,520 --> 00:44:52,720
here there's one more there are two fish in a tank and one says to the other how do you drive

540
00:44:52,720 --> 00:44:58,320
this thing fucking sucks google that was google google's like the company that owns all the things

541
00:44:58,320 --> 00:45:05,200
you think they could own like a good joke uh here's here's one here's one called random fun

543
00:45:12,400 --> 00:45:18,240
honestly more so this wasn't really a we didn't really write a joke this time what we did is one

544
00:45:18,240 --> 00:45:23,440
of our classic my brother my brother me goof adjacent segments where you think there's

545
00:45:23,440 --> 00:45:30,080
something funny in it and then you dig around and there's not but then you're three minutes closer

546
00:45:30,080 --> 00:45:35,840
to the podcast being over so everybody wins like in a year you remember something funny happening

547
00:45:35,840 --> 00:45:39,600
here but when you go back and re-listen to the episode you can't pinpoint what moment you were

548
00:45:39,600 --> 00:45:45,360
thinking of yeah if you're if you're scrubbing through right now trying to find that great joke

549
00:45:45,360 --> 00:45:50,880
that you heard on this episode it was earlier or later because it's not in this segment you can

550
00:45:50,880 --> 00:45:55,440
go ahead and even bend this episode yeah it may not have been this episode it was okay this is

551
00:45:55,440 --> 00:46:00,480
an okay one real middle of the pack right here this one oh it does riddle this fun i got this

557
00:46:31,280 --> 00:46:34,880
quick huh like give me a minute to fucking solve the riddle obviously travis solved it because he's

558
00:46:34,880 --> 00:46:39,040
a riddle master but i needed a little bit more time than this phone i'm giving this phone three

559
00:46:39,040 --> 00:46:43,040
stars out of five because it doesn't give you enough time to the bezel is like almost not there

560
00:46:43,040 --> 00:46:47,760
and the processor is like so fast it runs all my games so fast but when i ask you riddles it doesn't

561
00:46:47,760 --> 00:46:51,520
give you enough time to solve them three stars out of five sorry google i had to dock you two

562
00:46:51,520 --> 00:46:59,120
points on that one there's probably a setting for that um uh here's another question because

you're mobile you could live wherever you want your house moves fishing off the side 360 pool

582
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:06,560
is all super good i'm sure it's very scenic but you could wake up drowned and that's that might

583
00:49:06,560 --> 00:49:13,040
actually sort of outweigh the like i'm in my ranch style home here in texas that's a very low chance

584
00:49:13,040 --> 00:49:20,960
of it happening because it's not an aqua vehicle uh i mean if i if my regular house breaks i call

585
00:49:20,960 --> 00:49:29,920
a guy if my houseboat breaks i'm all of a sudden in like a desperate adventure movie situation like

586
00:49:29,920 --> 00:49:34,800
i'm i'm fighting for my life all of a sudden which maybe is not what you want to do when you're

587
00:49:34,800 --> 00:49:39,360
trying to just catch up on you know 24 or whatever you're doing at your home and before you say before

588
00:49:39,360 --> 00:49:45,520
you say it doesn't happen it happened to a bar in huntington so yes that is true but the question

589
00:49:45,520 --> 00:49:52,480
boys was not is it as responsible as it sounds the question was is it as fun as it sounds so

590
00:49:52,480 --> 00:49:56,640
you think it'd be pretty fun for your house to break and then you almost drown while you're

591
00:49:56,640 --> 00:50:01,600
trying to swim out of your home like oh i look at that roller coaster and something bad could happen

592
00:50:01,600 --> 00:50:05,360
so i'm not gonna get on that roller coaster doesn't mean the roller coaster is not fun

593
00:50:05,360 --> 00:50:10,800
it just means that you're being a little too responsible i think living on a houseboat would

594
00:50:10,800 --> 00:50:19,520
be as fun as it sounds right up until the moment when it sinks up until then you're right travis

595
00:50:19,520 --> 00:50:24,880
you shouldn't think about don't don't don't cry because it's over laugh because of the great

596
00:50:24,880 --> 00:50:29,680
memories you had along the way thank you because here's the thing no the house i live in now is

597
00:50:29,680 --> 00:50:33,920
most likely not going to sink unless we have a sinkhole situation but you know what else

598
00:50:33,920 --> 00:50:37,920
i also don't get to pretend like i'm on an adventure with my friends huck finn and tom

599
00:50:37,920 --> 00:50:44,160
sawyer every day sure you know what i mean like um can i read a yahoo do you think if you have

613
00:52:07,760 --> 00:52:12,160
nothing how can you find out if you're breastfed without asking anyone in your family never mind

614
00:52:12,160 --> 00:52:17,840
the batman stuff i just want to know about the breastfeeding i'm glad he got that different

615
00:52:17,840 --> 00:52:21,040
i'm glad he got that distraction otherwise otherwise i would have been listening the

616
00:52:21,040 --> 00:52:26,080
second half of the question wondering when's another batman joke coming what character is

617
00:52:26,080 --> 00:52:33,280
this let's put a smile on that face how could i find his breastfeeding don't think about the

618
00:52:33,280 --> 00:52:39,840
joker thing i want to know if i was breastfed from a breast riddle me this batman does your

619
00:52:39,840 --> 00:52:46,640
shirt have holes in it no what has two hands a face and doesn't move a clock what you said it

620
00:52:46,640 --> 00:52:53,280
way too fast the batman's the riddler i wasn't even i wasn't even done listening and the sound

621
00:52:53,280 --> 00:53:01,200
had not made it to my back ears yet how do you guys think he does put it on what how does batman

622
00:53:01,200 --> 00:53:05,440
put it on i was thinking about it like he would tell the ruler like no no buttons and then the

623
00:53:05,440 --> 00:53:09,200
room would be like then how'd you put it on and then batman would have to say something i guess

624
00:53:09,200 --> 00:53:14,000
he wouldn't he would probably just punch him but like if he wanted to answer how how would he put

625
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:19,440
it on right why didn't the riddler ever look at batman and say riddle me this who is batman and

626
00:53:19,440 --> 00:53:25,120
batman would be like bruce wayne shit damn he got me and solved it though and i give me 10 riddle

627
00:53:25,120 --> 00:53:30,880
points and when he says up 100 the riddler dies do you think in every batman story you've ever

628
00:53:30,880 --> 00:53:39,200
seen ever they have omitted a 10 second beat of footage where he's just like zip me up alfred

629
00:53:39,200 --> 00:53:47,280
alfred get no too tight corset me up alfred tighten my corset alfred it seems like a like a

630
00:53:47,280 --> 00:53:54,800
rubber spray like he's just sprayed on him sprayed it on human beings removing wetsuits before and

631
00:53:54,800 --> 00:54:02,320
it is not a cool thing or an easy thing it kind of looks like someone shedding their exoskeleton

632
00:54:02,320 --> 00:54:06,160
their carapace and if we're if we're being honest his wiener probably looks super weird in there

633
00:54:06,160 --> 00:54:09,680
super weird in there when you take like it probably looks super super soon it's like a

634
00:54:09,680 --> 00:54:13,840
little hot bag that you sweat into and then when you take it off like we don't talk about this ever

635
00:54:13,840 --> 00:54:19,440
but his wiener probably looks like pretty busted he's definitely fully talc'd up before it gets

636
00:54:19,440 --> 00:54:27,360
in there 360 degrees full coverage he's got like a spray tan booth of talcum powder it's like oh

637
00:54:27,360 --> 00:54:34,480
there's a crime okay i need 20 minutes to get i i just i gotta grease up and then talc up and then

638
00:54:34,480 --> 00:54:39,200
get in the suit and that takes a while and i had to put in a lot of soundproofing so you wouldn't

639
00:54:39,200 --> 00:54:45,360
hear the squeaking and the screaming do you think at some point in the relationship alfred has come

640
00:54:45,360 --> 00:54:54,240
to him and said uh master bruce yes uh i'm just gonna ask a fucking kid please stop peeing in the

641
00:54:54,240 --> 00:55:04,880
suit master bruce i have to fucking wash it okay master bruce please stop peeing in the suit i

642
00:55:04,880 --> 00:55:12,320
have taken the liberty of i've crafted you a flannel number with several zippers and buttons

643
00:55:12,320 --> 00:55:21,120
and flaps no okay but just for a second just consider master bruce who do you think it stinks

644
00:55:21,120 --> 00:55:25,280
like shit there's nothing we're gonna do about that you're getting you're fighting the penguin

645
00:55:25,280 --> 00:55:29,760
you're sweating to high heaven i'll quit and then i'll need a way to make money and i can think of

646
00:55:29,760 --> 00:55:35,280
one pretty fucking good one and it's a book called here's what the bat cave is by me alfred who no

647
00:55:35,280 --> 00:55:41,760
longer watches it's called the secrets of the underground piss boy and that's you that's you

648
00:55:42,720 --> 00:55:48,160
you and chapter one you'll never believe this clammy pingness i'll tell them about the time

649
00:55:48,160 --> 00:55:54,240
you got scared last year remember master bruce really scared remember really really scared i

650
00:55:54,240 --> 00:56:01,120
think of it as alfred's super bad day that he had because of you master bruce you remember when he

651
00:56:01,120 --> 00:56:06,400
hey gotham chapter two remember when bane almost blew our thing up with i forget why but it was

652
00:56:06,400 --> 00:56:18,720
really dumb but anyway batman came home from that one and his balls were so pruney it was the suit

653
00:56:18,720 --> 00:56:27,840
is so tight he was out there for a few days just getting wildly pruney down there chapter three

654
00:56:27,840 --> 00:56:34,160
master bruce stopped watching dexter after season three but he continued to make me recap episodes

655
00:56:34,160 --> 00:56:39,920
after i watched them for the entirety of the series literally half of my day is spent recapping

656
00:56:39,920 --> 00:56:48,880
dexter for batman batman took a weird turn i like it he's a weird dude man uh the other day my

657
00:56:48,880 --> 00:56:52,720
boyfriend went thrift shopping on his day off from work when he got home i asked him if he had found

658
00:56:52,720 --> 00:56:58,000
anything good he said that he had and proceeded to show me a chris angel mind freak magic kit

659
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:03,760

660
00:57:03,760 --> 00:57:12,480

661
00:57:12,480 --> 00:57:18,880
some of the minds having already been freaked yeah you can't unfreeze those beans um can you

662
00:57:20,080 --> 00:57:23,280

663
00:57:23,280 --> 00:57:26,560

664
00:57:27,120 --> 00:57:31,040
yeah you got it all right um the other day my boyfriend went thrift shopping

665
00:57:31,040 --> 00:57:43,680

667
00:57:51,120 --> 00:57:56,400
