1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:30,720
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:44,400
It's a new craze, and good girls do you wanna just say hey I wanna, just say hey I wanna.

6
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:47,760
Hello everybody and welcome to my brother on brother mean advice show for the modern era.

7
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:51,360
I'm your oldest brother Justin McElroy. I'm your middle-est brother,

8
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:58,160
old thang zine Travis McElroy. Zip zoop, I'm future Griffin McElroy,

9
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:01,360
and I've got android tubes coming out of the whole wazoo.

10
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:07,360
Now, okay Griffin, we're recording this way in advance. Aren't you past Griffin?

11
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,080
Okay, we're recording this in 2019 when it comes out in 2020. I'm assuming

12
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:14,960
by the time, what is this like January 6th? Oops.

13
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:19,440
Oh, that was part of Griffin's robot parts. That was a phone call that was coming out

14
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:23,920
of my chest. I assume by 2020 when this one comes out I'm gonna have tubes.

15
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:25,840
Yeah. Gonna be tubing.

16
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:30,080
Tubes. I just wanna say something. This is the time of year. It's the magical time of year where

17
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:36,800
we brand the new year and set a tone for the whole year, and everyone knows 2019 was 20 Frankenstein

18
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:42,080
teen become the monster, but let me just say, hey, this is Travis saying, you guys, you may not

19
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:49,200
realize it, but I kinda won because I hard pitched 20 equine teen this year were getting a horse,

20
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:51,920
and let me check the books. Oh, yeah.

21
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:54,640
We got a horse named Worldwide Webster, so.

22
00:01:54,640 --> 00:02:00,080
Yeah, I don't know how much monster morphing I'd really, if I'm being honest,

23
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:03,600
if I'm really debriefing. It's good to be honest with yourself. I feel like

24
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:12,000
I didn't, my wife got me a bidet for Christmas. That's as close as I got to becoming the monster,

25
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,000
and I do feel like in a way, you know, okay.

26
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,920
Creature from the brown lagoon, go on.

27
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:24,240
I'm gonna say it's just like becoming the monster, if you think about it, it's a wonderful life.

28
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:32,880
That fool didn't, there's no way that he had a bidet, that super nice guy in it. He did not

29
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:34,800
have a bidet. But Mr. Potter had eight bidets.

30
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:40,400
Mr. Potter garun fucking teed. His whole seat was a bidet.

31
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:46,000
His whole thing's a bidet. Guaranteed that guy had a bidet. So on that sliding scale

32
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:50,960
between Mr. Potter and George Bailey, I definitely moved away from George Bailey

33
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:53,680
when my lovely wife got me a bidet for Christmas.

34
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:58,000
See, I would say I definitely became the monster because I put on 120 pounds of muscle.

35
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:06,080
And I'm six foot seven now. So that part of it, for sure.

36
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:10,640
I mean, I got a genuine internet vampire blood transfusion that I did buy on Etsy.

37
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:15,440
Yeah, that's for sure. Hey Griffin, you look great. Very pale and sparkly.

38
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:18,320
Yeah, you know, and I'll have to take your fucking word for it, won't I?

39
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:21,280
No more mirrors. Can't see in the mirrors.

40
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:27,040
Can't see in the mirror. So I've put a lot of thought into 2020. What about you, Griffin?

41
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:36,080
You know, I've got, no, I've been making it up sort of for the last three minutes and 40 seconds.

42
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:40,000
Oh my God, really? I've been working on this list for four months. What about you, Justin?

43
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,840
Yeah, absolutely. I've been working on it.

44
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:45,680
I know you haven't, Justin, because you told us before we started recording, you forgot.

45
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:51,840
It didn't, not that I forget. We didn't plan on this being this episode until it was.

46
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:54,000
I've planned on it this whole time.

47
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,920
Okay, listen, listen, listen. We got 2010 was Zolo.

48
00:03:57,920 --> 00:03:58,240
Right.

49
00:03:58,880 --> 00:03:59,840
What did that mean?

50
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:01,440
Don't know.

51
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:01,920
Don't know.

52
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:08,880
Was it like a YOLO thing? It was 10 calendar years ago. No one can remember.

53
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:12,320
Correct. This will be our 10th anniversary. Maybe there's something there.

54
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:17,040
Now, I was thinking Zozo, but that's the that's the terrifying.

55
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:20,480
God, this is the 10th one of these we've done. Oh my God.

56
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:22,800
Now, what was 2011?

57
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:24,480
2011 was...

58
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:28,320
11th. Excuse me, this is the 11th one of these that we have done.

59
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:31,760
Holy shit. Okay, I have the wiki pulled up. Let's just blaze through.

60
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:32,400
Okay, go for it.

61
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:37,760
Zolo. That was less official. So this could be our official 10th year theme.

62
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:40,960
2011, 2000 in heaven, get right with Christ.

63
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:43,680
Okay, that's a good one.

64
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:45,520
Interesting start that we had there.

65
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:48,960
2012 was getting it in 20 does.

66
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:49,840
20 does, yes.

67
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:51,840
20 does, getting it in 20 does.

68
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:55,280
2013 was 2013, dig it up, get it out.

69
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:55,520
Yeah.

70
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:59,600
I should just be laughing at the dumb shit we said eight years ago, but here we are.

71
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:02,320
20 forward. That was a powerful one.

72
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:04,800
That was a good one. Move the chains.

73
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:09,760
2015, 2015, the con is on.

74
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:10,160
Follow that one.

75
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:13,600
You got to get the subtitles. It's so important for your years to have subtitles.

76
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:14,240
That's true.

77
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:18,640
Then we had 2016, building bridges, our biggest whiff.

78
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:20,240
Our biggest stupid loony.

79
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:21,600
Oh, that one.

80
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:24,000
2017, very powerful.

81
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:28,400
20 serpentine, keep them guessing, or zag on them if you prefer.

82
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:29,520
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

83
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:32,560
Then we had collaborate teen, stronger together.

84
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:33,680
That was a powerful year.

85
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:38,000
20, and then lastly, Frankenstein teen, become the monster.

86
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,840
Yes, which I nailed.

87
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:44,720
And I've seen a lot of buzz on the forums.

88
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:46,160
What will it be?

89
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:48,160
What variety printed a story about it?

90
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:48,720
What will it be?

91
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:50,560
New York Times printed a story about it.

92
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:53,200
They wrote it in a new chapter in the Bible.

93
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:57,200
And a lot of people have been guessing it's going to be just something about 2020,

94
00:05:58,480 --> 00:06:01,600
see clearly, or 2020, a look back, or something like that.

95
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:04,800
That's basic. That's fucking basic.

96
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:06,160
We are not looking back.

97
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:11,760
The subtitle for this year needs to be whatever the opposite of looking back is,

98
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:13,120
which I guess is looking forward.

99
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:14,560
And I think we've done that one already.

100
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:15,280
So nevermind.

101
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:16,560
Look, can I pitch one?

102
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:17,920
And I've learned from the past.

103
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:19,520
I'm going to say my favorite one.

104
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:22,320
Travis, can I just say, you are juiced right now.

105
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:23,360
I'm excited.

106
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:25,760
Fewer good rhymes, I will say, for this year.

107
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:27,920
Well, teen, we had an abundance of riches.

108
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:30,400
Well, now stick with me here.

109
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:32,880
You're going to see where I'm going with this one.

110
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:35,600
But 20 bunny, hop to it.

111
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:35,920
All right.

112
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:38,160
So you know that's not good, but it's good to get like a-

113
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:39,840
Right, I'm trying to get the ball rolling.

114
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:41,520
You got to fire all the blanks out of the cartridge.

115
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:43,520
20 bunny, hop to it.

116
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:44,800
Yeah, yeah.

117
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:46,000
So that one's gone.

118
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,160
20 hunty, go get it.

119
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:52,320
Hunty, like you're hunting.

120
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:53,520
Well, this is interesting.

121
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:56,720
Maybe this is the year, and I like it.

122
00:06:56,720 --> 00:07:00,240
You know my shit is like practical, get out there.

123
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:03,440
Like add a direction, an instruction

124
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:04,800
for our listeners to follow.

125
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:07,600
And I think let's all get into hunting this year.

126
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:09,040
Yeah, that's a weird energy.

127
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:11,840
That is a weird energy, but only for population control.

128
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:12,800
Let's be clear.

129
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:14,480
This is not big game hunting.

130
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:17,440
This is not, oh God, no, that's disgusting.

131
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:21,040
This is for food and for population control.

132
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:21,760
That's it.

133
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:23,680
We're talking about sewer pigs.

134
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:24,180
Yeah.

135
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:26,880
I want to hit you guys with one, okay?

136
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:30,160
Okay, we're not, who's writing these down?

137
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:31,040
Griffin, you have to write them down

138
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:33,360
since you didn't prepare as many as me and Travis did.

139
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:34,720
Or was that a bit?

140
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:36,160
Do I have to write down 20 bunny?

141
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:36,800
No, it's a thing.

142
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:37,920
No, 20 bunny's out.

143
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:38,420
Okay.

144
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:41,440
Make a shared document, please.

145
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:43,200
Oh my God, I didn't realize we were gonna get fucking-

146
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:45,280
This is our advice show, by the way.

147
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:46,960
And every year we pick a new year theme.

148
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:48,080
Welcome to your first episode

149
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:49,680
if you're just now listening, I'm sorry.

150
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:51,520
You should not, let's start with this one, honestly.

151
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:53,680
No, this is gonna set the tone for your whole year.

152
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:58,000
Work space, this is scratch paper of an episode.

153
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,680
Listen, let me hit you with this.

154
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:03,440
20 binti, living large.

155
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:06,240
20 binti, like a-

156
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:07,440
Like a venti.

157
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:09,680
Like a venti, 20 venti, living large.

158
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:10,560
Because it's 20.

159
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:15,120
20 venti, living large.

160
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:17,840
Huh, venti rhymes with 20.

161
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:19,440
20 venti, living large.

162
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:22,800
Well, hold on, you just said it and so you know it doesn't.

163
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:24,880
And you also, you keep saying venti.

164
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:27,200
20, yes, that's as close as we're gonna get.

165
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:30,880
Okay, okay, I feel like I should-

166
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:33,680
20 venti, living large.

167
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:34,400
That's not bad.

168
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:37,280
Can you play in it?

169
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:41,920
Can you just get on top of it for a second?

170
00:08:41,920 --> 00:08:43,040
Take it around the track.

171
00:08:43,040 --> 00:08:44,960
20 venti, don't be a drip.

172
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:46,880
Oh, that's not bad.

173
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:48,640
I'm gonna write that down.

174
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:50,080
Okay, really?

175
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:52,560
Weird, kind of a play on mine.

176
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:53,680
Yeah, I remixed it a little bit.

177
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:56,880
20 venti, don't talk to me before I've had my coffee.

178
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:58,080
That's fun too.

179
00:08:58,720 --> 00:08:59,920
It's attainable at least.

180
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:00,320
Yeah.

181
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:01,840
We're just all not gonna talk to each other

182
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:02,320
until we've had our coffee.

183
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:03,120
Let's just not.

184
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:05,040
We need to be careful here.

185
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:05,360
Okay.

186
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:10,800
Because we are stumbling in the direction of just sort of a bad like slant rhyme.

187
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:14,960
Like 20 plenty can't be it, right?

188
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:18,080
Well, we went with Frankenstein Teen, Griffin.

189
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:21,200
Yeah, there's, listen, it's gonna be a slant rhyme, bud.

190
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:22,160
There's nothing else.

191
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:24,880
There's nothing that rhymes with 20?

192
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:26,080
No, nothing.

193
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:29,120
Well, can I, hunty did.

194
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:30,880
I'm just saying, hunty did.

195
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:33,040
Well, I can say a lot of different sounds.

196
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:33,200
Yeah.

197
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:34,560
That doesn't make them English words.

198
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:38,080
Well, look, I wanna now throw out the one that I think is a real contender.

199
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:38,480
Okay.

200
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:42,720
I'm really proud of that I wanna throw out here now right in the middle so it sticks.

201
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:46,240
20 honey down to bee'sness.

202
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:48,480
And now here's the thing about it.

203
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:52,080
It's about getting down to business, which is important.

204
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:52,960
And also.

205
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:53,680
Saving the bees.

206
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:54,480
Bees.

207
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:54,800
Yeah.

208
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:56,880
20 honey, H-U-N-N-Y.

209
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:57,680
20 honey.

210
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:59,360
Oh, wait, you're spelling it like a poo bear.

211
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:00,880
Yeah, 20 honey.

212
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:01,920
The poo spelling.

213
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:04,320
Yes, 20 honey down to bee'sness.

214
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:05,600
Down to bee'sness.

215
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:06,960
Travis, that's really good, bud.

216
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:10,640
I was starting to think that after 20 honey, hunty.

217
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:13,680
See, you've just kind of taken 20 hunty and sort of-

218
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:14,640
But I made it better.

219
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:14,880
Made it far more.

220
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:18,080
Because you gotta say it like this, 20 honey down to bee'sness.

221
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:21,280
I am, this is the best one so far, obviously.

222
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:24,320
And here, let me also just say, a lot of my choices were influenced.

223
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:27,440
A lot of this is to blame on Paul Sabourin.

224
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:29,440
Because Paul got us-

225
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:29,920
Paul.

226
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:34,160
He got us a gobo for our tours.

227
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:37,200
So that behind all of our tours this year, it said, become the monster.

228
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:39,040
And that was very exciting to me.

229
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:40,800
And we branded our tours a lot this way.

230
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:44,400
So this year I thought, well, it'll be a fun branding for our tours.

231
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:45,760
Because they will also be on the posters.

232
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:46,880
It'll be on the gobos behind us.

233
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:48,000
And I thought, you know what I like?

234
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:49,200
Bees.

235
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:50,960
And bee iconography.

236
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:55,920
There's no spelling of the word bee'sness that looks like fucking anything.

237
00:10:55,920 --> 00:11:01,120
B-E-E-S dash N-E-S-S.

238
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:01,920
Already a plus.

239
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:06,000
Just an embarrassment of E's in this one.

240
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,920
20 honey down to bee'sness.

241
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:11,040
I don't think it's a type of phrase.

242
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:12,160
We can't make merch out of it.

243
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:14,240
Because this phrase can never be written down.

244
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:16,000
And must only be spoken.

245
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:19,840
Yeah, legibility is not its strong suit.

246
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:25,600
But if Travis is inventing words, I'm gonna, let me pitch this one.

247
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:28,400
20 bunty, just get on base.

248
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:31,520
20 bunny, bunty.

249
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:32,480
No, how about this?

250
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:35,760
20 bunty, just get on base.

251
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:38,320
May I just pop the bat out in front?

252
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:40,480
Get on this one for a second, Travis.

253
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:43,680
I'm gonna tweet, Travis, can you stop and play in the baseball diamond?

254
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:44,640
I am going to play in it.

255
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:47,520
I'm going to play by tweaking the subtitle a little bit.

256
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:49,360
Well, but can you just try mine?

257
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:50,240
Yes, but it's the same.

258
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:52,720
Okay, just get on base.

259
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:55,120
That sounds defeatist, if I may.

260
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:56,560
It sounds attainable, but go on.

261
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:59,200
Okay, 20 bunty, advance the runners.

262
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:03,280
Right, now this is, you're gonna sacrifice the out.

263
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:04,800
But you're gonna advance the runners.

264
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:07,680
You know, maybe you're getting someone home.

265
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:12,400
This is a motto where you say sacrifice yourself for the good of others.

266
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:14,720
Listen, yeah, yeah.

267
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:16,720
20 bunty, advance the runners.

268
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:20,800
20 bunty is probably more powerful than advance, yes.

269
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:26,320
20 bunty is probably, advance the runners is probably more, that is, okay.

270
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:29,840
That's the one to write down, Griffin, to chip into the tablet.

271
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:32,320
20 bunty, here's, okay.

272
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:34,000
I'm gonna have to lay down the law here.

273
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
And this is gonna be helpful for us moving forward,

274
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:40,080
because there's an infinite number of bad rhymes we can generate here.

275
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:44,160
The second word cannot have a hard T in it.

276
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:47,520
Because having to say 20 bunty is wild and impossible.

277
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:50,480
I like it, the way you said it, that made me very happy.

278
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:54,400
What about just 20 funny, maybe this year?

279
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:57,520
And that's a personal one, that's for us.

280
00:12:58,160 --> 00:12:59,760
Maybe this year will be funny?

281
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:00,480
Yeah.

282
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:03,440
What about 20 funny, fill your life with laughter and love?

283
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:18,080
That one's so wholesome, that one is so, that sounds like it leered straight

284
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:20,080
from the Growing Beans theme song.

285
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:24,400
It sounds like, it's so attainable.

286
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:28,160
The idea of us having to say that a lot this year.

287
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:29,520
Say it one more time, Griffin.

288
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:32,080
20 funny, fill your life with laughter and love.

289
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:35,520
Now how is that more attainable than Advanced to Runners?

290
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:38,400
That seems the least attainable, that's so ephemeral.

291
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:40,000
But have you guys all said it yet?

292
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:45,680
Because it's 20 funny, fill your life with laughter and love.

293
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:48,320
So this is gonna be the, so when people come to see us,

294
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:51,040
it'll be for the fill your life with laughter and love tour.

295
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:53,360
Yes guys, are you hearing yourself?

296
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:58,240
You need to close your eyes and generate a stage,

297
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:00,800
and then flash that gobo up on it.

298
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:01,600
Okay.

299
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:02,960
Holy fucking shit.

300
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:05,120
Okay, how about this?

301
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:07,440
If we wanna go a little more attainable,

302
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:09,520
not more attainable, but maybe more concrete,

303
00:14:10,640 --> 00:14:12,880
20 Penny, get rid of it.

304
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:16,960
Did you say pity or penny?

305
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:19,760
Penny, this is the year that we get rid of the penny.

306
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:23,360
20 Penny sent to heaven.

307
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:25,520
Sent to heaven is cool.

308
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:28,160
C-E-N-T, you say.

309
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:29,360
Yeah dude, that's cool.

310
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:33,600
Yeah, 20 Penny sent to heaven, or sent to hell.

311
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:35,520
But I like to think the penny's put in its work,

312
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:37,200
it gets to ascend to its great reward.

313
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:39,520
It used to be able to buy shit with it.

314
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:41,280
I don't think its irrelevance makes it.

315
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:43,280
There's a whole kind of candy named after

316
00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:44,640
how you used to be able to spend it on it.

317
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:45,840
And an ante.

318
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:46,340
Yeah.

319
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:51,600
I don't think we have in our ability to get rid of-

320
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:54,160
The penny, a form of US currency.

321
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:56,880
What about 20 money?

322
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:59,840
Ben basically kept Hamilton on the $10 bill,

323
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:01,200
so he knows the people.

324
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:03,040
He used it up, everybody gets-

325
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:04,880
He burned it, he wasted it.

326
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:07,040
When he could've been sending pennies to hell.

327
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:07,520
Right.

328
00:15:07,520 --> 00:15:09,200
20 money, get that paper.

329
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:12,960
Or here's an opportunity that this year,

330
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:17,040
and as far as I'm aware, only this year is gonna provide us,

331
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:19,600
unless we live to 30-30, which is-

332
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:20,720
Possible.

333
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:23,680
It's possible, is that it's the same.

334
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:24,880
Uh-huh.

335
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:28,720
So it could be just like 20-20, repeat.

336
00:15:29,520 --> 00:15:33,840
No, it could be money-money, Papa wants it, Papa gets it.

337
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:35,520
Something along those lines.

338
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:35,840
Oh, okay.

339
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:38,240
Money-money, get that paper.

340
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:39,920
Honey-money, down to bee'sness.

341
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:41,200
Honey-

342
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:44,560
Okay, you seem to have perverted this fine idea.

343
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:47,600
So now we get business and bees both in there.

344
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:50,880
Honey-money, down to bee'sness.

345
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:53,280
I'll write that down, Travis, but I'm not loving it.

346
00:15:53,280 --> 00:15:54,960
That's fine, that's fine.

347
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:55,680
That's fine.

348
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:59,920
Bunny-money, get some carrots.

349
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:01,760
It's important for you guys to get in this doc with me,

350
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:03,520
because seeing it all written down is-

351
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:06,080
Where is it, where's the link?

352
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:08,880
I've shared it, I've shared it, check your emails.

353
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:10,000
Oh, in the emails, okay.

354
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:12,560
The Network, Green Day Side Project,

355
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:15,600
the Network had one album called Money Money 2020.

356
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:15,920
Uh-huh.

357
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:18,960
Okay, did you just Google that just to make sure it was-

358
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:21,600
No, I remembered the name, I didn't remember the name of the album,

359
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:24,480
but I've heard somebody say Money Money 2020 before.

360
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:28,000
You've put 20 funny, fill your life with laughter and love,

361
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:32,320
in a special font and font size,

362
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:36,240
which feels unfair to 20 honey, down to bee'sness,

363
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:38,320
which I feel they're tied right now.

364
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:40,000
You're right, they are tied right now.

365
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:40,720
You're right, Travis.

366
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:42,880
I'm gonna give that one the special treatment as well,

367
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:44,880
so don't worry about a thing.

368
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:48,640
Well, you put it in Comic Sans and then you made it small.

369
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:49,920
Aww.

370
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:51,680
This is an abuse of power.

371
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:54,320
Now what if, what if, Griffin, may I?

372
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:59,280
What if it was honey funny, fill your life with laughter and bees?

373
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:01,920
It's interesting.

374
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:06,000
Huh, that's interesting, fill your bees with laughter and love.

375
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,200
Ooh, I like that too.

376
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:09,840
That's going somewhere.

377
00:17:09,840 --> 00:17:14,720
Okay, so I think we're on funny honey.

378
00:17:15,840 --> 00:17:17,120
Fill your bees with laughter, no.

379
00:17:17,840 --> 00:17:19,200
Okay, we're spiraling.

380
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:21,440
I don't think you can just say no, Griffin.

381
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:22,720
I think you have to put it in there.

382
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:25,600
Okay, we need more content.

383
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:27,760
Right now we're trying to bake a pizza

384
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:31,440
and we have three ingredients and one of them is an eraser.

385
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:35,760
We need more ingredients in here to make this tasty pizza with.

386
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:42,000
Okay, has anybody ever said blinny as a short way of saying blender?

387
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:42,560
No.

388
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:42,880
No.

389
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:44,240
Okay, I resent.

390
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:51,440
I don't have anything at the moment.

391
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:51,760
All right.

392
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:53,440
Please, please return to me.

393
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:56,240
I cede my turn to the next contestant.

394
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:59,280
We open the floor to rhymezone.com.

395
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:02,320
Now, yes, I have turned to RhymeZone myself.

396
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:02,800
I see.

397
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:06,800
I too have been at RhymeZone for some time.

398
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:12,320
Now they do, it's interesting, blood money, bloody money.

399
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:13,440
No, that's nothing.

400
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:14,720
No, I don't think so.

401
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:16,240
How about 20 runny?

402
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:21,760
There's a word called intente

403
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:25,200
and it's a friendly understanding between political power.

404
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:27,040
So I'm gonna put that one right back in the toilet.

405
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:27,840
It climbed out of.

406
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:30,480
How about 20 Ginny?

407
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:32,080
It's your year, Jennifer.

408
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:33,920
Hey, this one's cool for Jennifer's.

409
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:37,760
It's targeted at Jennifer's, but like they'll love it, right?

410
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:39,920
Well, if we're going there about just like 20 Dougie.

411
00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:42,720
That one doesn't rhyme and mine did.

412
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:47,120
No, 20 Ginny, you can hear that does it.

413
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:49,600
I mean, they both end in me, I guess.

414
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:51,600
There's a lot of things that RhymeZone is telling me

415
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:53,360
rhymes with 20 that, hey, RhymeZone,

416
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:55,200
fully fucking doesn't rhyme.

417
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:58,080
I think plenty and 20.

418
00:18:58,080 --> 00:18:58,960
20 and plenty.

419
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:02,960
Nothing rhymes with the way humans say 20, right?

420
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:08,720
Now I've just put in honey and found things that rhyme with that.

421
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:12,160
One of the things is the knee.

422
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:14,160
So what about 20 the knee?

423
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:17,680
Where we all just focus on our knees and take care of it.

424
00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:19,040
That one doesn't rhyme, Travis.

425
00:19:19,040 --> 00:19:19,680
That one doesn't.

426
00:19:19,680 --> 00:19:20,480
No, this is good.

427
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:21,600
20 the knee.

428
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:23,600
I'm dissociating, this is the pits.

429
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:25,120
Stop, listen, 20 the knee.

430
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:28,720
Lift with your back just this year.

431
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:34,640
And we're not doctors and you shouldn't listen to the shit we say,

432
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:37,360
but like maybe give the knees a break.

433
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:42,720
Your back's been living the fucking high life for too long.

434
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:47,200
I'm feeling very strongly about funny honey.

435
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:49,040
Fill your life with laughter and bees.

436
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:55,120
I am feeling good about 20 Palminteri chazes to the front.

437
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:57,680
Chazes to the front, party in the back.

438
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:01,920
Palminteri isn't even the close.

439
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:03,920
20 minty, freshen it up.

440
00:20:04,560 --> 00:20:05,280
20 minty.

441
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:09,760
I'm trying to get in the place I was at when I said Frankenstein team

442
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:12,080
because it was the kind of outside the bun.

443
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:14,320
I think the place you're at was about 25 minutes in

444
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:17,200
and we just wanted to do anything else if memory serves.

445
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:20,640
And hey, let's just say we're there right now and we are only 20 minutes in.

446
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:23,280
So each year we're getting a little bit faster to this point.

447
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:27,600
Rhyme Zone has suggested that to rhyme with 20 is Allegheny.

448
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:29,040
How do we feel about that?

449
00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:29,680
Or not?

450
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:33,120
No, listen, I'm not going to rely on this crutch of Rhyme Zone anymore.

451
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:33,760
Yeah.

452
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:34,400
20.

453
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:35,040
20.

454
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:36,480
Let's look at our options so far.

455
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:38,640
We may have a diamond in the rough.

456
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:39,200
Yeah.

457
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:41,040
Griffin, you've stopped writing them down, right?

458
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:44,080
Because the last one you have here is Down to Beesness.

459
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:48,080
No, Travis has added honey money down to Beesness.

460
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:51,280
Now he's writing funny honey, fill your-

461
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:53,200
Yeah, we know what the rest of the sentence is going to be.

462
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:54,880
So I don't need to continue reading that.

463
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:59,120
Funny honey, fill your life with laughter and bees.

464
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:00,240
Okay, now hold on.

465
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:03,920
I don't think it's good.

466
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:05,680
I don't think it's good.

467
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:06,960
Can I just say something?

468
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:09,200
I feel very strongly about funny honey.

469
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:10,800
But who's this knocking at the door?

470
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:14,080
It's 20 Bunty wondering where his place at the table is.

471
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:17,280
Well, 20 Bunty advanced the runners is pretty good.

472
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:18,320
It is pretty good.

473
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:20,880
Advance the bees with laughter and love.

474
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:26,160
I feel like we have gotten away from subtitling a year

475
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:29,840
and have entered a sort of fugue state of sounds.

476
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:31,520
And ideas and thoughts and colors

477
00:21:32,560 --> 00:21:36,720
that aren't necessarily a coherent way of approaching a year.

478
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:39,040
People rely on us for direction.

479
00:21:39,040 --> 00:21:42,720
But okay, funny honey, fill your life with laughter and bees

480
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:46,000
are two, I think, attainable goals.

481
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,160
Where do you find bees though, right?

482
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:49,600
At the bee store.

483
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:52,560
Okay, I'm not in a place in my life, Travis,

484
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:55,680
where I can just have some bees.

485
00:21:55,680 --> 00:21:59,760
I'm barely holding it together myself.

486
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:01,840
Yeah, you're gonna need to set up an aviary.

487
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:04,960
This is true, but everyone knows you're gonna have to.

488
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:08,480
Listen, the bees aren't gonna save themselves.

489
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:10,240
I think we've all figured that out.

490
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:11,760
They certainly, if they are,

491
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:13,760
they're taking their sweet fucking time.

492
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:14,960
So we need to save the bees.

493
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:16,320
And you know what else they could save?

494
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:17,200
Laughter.

495
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:20,080
Okay, let's put bees in a box for just a second.

496
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:22,000
No, unless there's vents.

497
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:27,000
This, you know, it's dumb to have to say 22 times

498
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:28,640
if you think about it.

499
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:30,000
You're just repeating yourself.

500
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,440
Let me pitch this to you.

501
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:33,920
20, efficiency above all.

502
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:41,360
I like the message, but I hate also the message,

503
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:42,080
which is weird.

504
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:46,400
What about 20 twice, one more again?

505
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:48,080
20 twice.

506
00:22:49,040 --> 00:22:51,440
20 twice is interesting.

507
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:54,720
20 twice, take a second.

508
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:57,280
20 twice, second chance.

509
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:01,200
20 twice, fill your life with laughter.

510
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:12,080
20 twice feels so nice.

511
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:13,600
Well, now that's just a rhyme

512
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:16,640
and not so much a followable kind of command.

513
00:23:18,560 --> 00:23:20,480
20 twice, roll the dice.

514
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:22,000
Roll the dice.

515
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,880
What is the connection between this 20 twice,

516
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:25,840
second chances?

517
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:31,280
Or, 20 twice, roll the dice got such a baby response.

518
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:32,400
Because it means nothing.

519
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:34,800
There's no connection.

520
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:35,920
It just rhymes.

521
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:37,280
It means 2020.

522
00:23:39,040 --> 00:23:41,920
Yeah, buddy, fucking slurp it down, dog.

523
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:43,120
What do you got?

524
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:43,760
What you got?

525
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:46,720
What are you fucking drinking though?

526
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:48,320
I bet it's hardy.

527
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:52,960
I bet it's hardy and rich, hardy fucking drink.

528
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:54,560
The iced coffee you left here.

529
00:23:54,560 --> 00:23:55,600
Yeah, baby.

530
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:56,240
Thanks for that.

531
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:57,280
Yeah, you're welcome.

532
00:23:57,280 --> 00:23:59,520
20 twice, sugar and spice.

533
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:00,880
Well, now you're just rhyming.

534
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:04,080
No, because sugar and spice are two different things.

535
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:06,880
20 twice, twice is nice.

536
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:08,480
We'll just, I'll try harder.

537
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:12,000
Well, but see, once again, twice is nice feels ephemeral.

538
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,080
20 twice, let's all be nice.

539
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:15,120
No.

540
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:16,480
20, okay.

541
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:19,760
We can't follow become the monster with let's now oops,

542
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:21,200
let's all be nice.

543
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:25,200
Okay, if we're gonna go 20 twice,

544
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:28,080
I think it needs to be like 20 twice a second look

545
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:29,920
or 20 twice second chances.

546
00:24:30,560 --> 00:24:31,200
Not powerful.

547
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:31,760
Not powerful.

548
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:35,440
I think I don't Brooke with second chances anymore.

549
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:36,720
We all gotta get serious.

550
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:41,840
Okay, 20 twice, two for the money.

551
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:44,400
That doesn't mean anything.

552
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:45,920
I know, but you were saying bullshit

553
00:24:45,920 --> 00:24:47,600
that didn't mean anything either and I laughed.

554
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:49,280
Sugar and spice is good.

555
00:24:49,280 --> 00:24:50,960
But what does it mean?

556
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:54,080
It means in moderation be sweet.

557
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:54,880
Justin, I swear to God,

558
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:55,920
if you delete 20 funny,

559
00:24:55,920 --> 00:24:57,600
fill your life with laughter and love.

560
00:24:57,600 --> 00:24:58,960
I was actually highlighting it

561
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:00,160
because it's starting to come around.

562
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:01,280
Yeah, Justin, have you actually,

563
00:25:01,280 --> 00:25:02,480
Justin, have you said it out loud?

564
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:03,280
No, say it.

565
00:25:03,280 --> 00:25:03,840
Justin, say it.

566
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:07,920
20 funny, fill your life with laughter and love.

567
00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:09,040
Yeah, that one's good.

568
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:11,520
20 funny, fill your life with laughter and love.

569
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:13,760
And the thing is, is it does what it says

570
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:14,960
right there on the box.

571
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:17,680
It's so valuable.

572
00:25:17,680 --> 00:25:20,640
I'm imagining the merch now.

573
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:22,320
I'm imagining walking around

574
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:24,800
with a fucking jacket on it

575
00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:28,400
and on the back it'd be like a cool tribal print.

576
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:29,920
But it also says 20 funny,

577
00:25:29,920 --> 00:25:31,360
fill your life with laughter and love.

578
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:34,080
I think it's the first one

579
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:35,120
we've ever come up with

580
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:37,680
that actually in saying it

581
00:25:37,680 --> 00:25:40,160
fills your life with laughter and love.

582
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:45,120
It does, it fulfills the goal right there

583
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:47,120
just by saying it out loud.

584
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:51,120
Can we please, I'll do, I promise 2021,

585
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:53,680
I'll bow out and you two can pick it

586
00:25:53,680 --> 00:25:55,680
and I won't get a vote.

587
00:25:55,680 --> 00:25:57,040
I am ready to relent.

588
00:25:57,040 --> 00:26:00,160
I am ready to grant this

589
00:26:00,160 --> 00:26:02,880
to 20 funny, fill your life with laughter.

590
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:03,520
I will too.

591
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:07,040
I can get through one time without saying it,

592
00:26:07,040 --> 00:26:08,000
without laughing, I mean.

593
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,000
I also will say though,

594
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,080
if there's an underground contingent

595
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:14,160
that wants to always say funny honey,

596
00:26:14,160 --> 00:26:15,520
fill your life with laughter and bees,

597
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:16,560
that's up to you.

598
00:26:16,560 --> 00:26:17,760
I can't stop you from doing it.

599
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:20,800
That's like the fucking Weird Al version of our theme.

600
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:22,160
What you have to understand, Travis,

601
00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:23,440
is that you have,

602
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:25,680
I don't want you to bastardize your art

603
00:26:25,680 --> 00:26:28,080
because 20 honey down to bee'sness

604
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:30,000
is way better than that bullshit.

605
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:32,800
You have made a pale mockery

606
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:35,520
of 20 funny, fill your life with laughter and love.

607
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:37,040
20 honey down to bee'sness

608
00:26:37,040 --> 00:26:39,120
is its own thing.

609
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:42,160
And if we're gonna have a shadow camp,

610
00:26:42,160 --> 00:26:43,040
I feel like it's got,

611
00:26:43,040 --> 00:26:44,720
I think 20 honey down to bee'sness.

612
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:47,840
I just feel, I just like the phrase bee'sness.

613
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:49,360
Oh, we all do, we all do.

614
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:51,040
Okay, you can also,

615
00:26:51,040 --> 00:26:52,000
okay, so there it is.

616
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:52,640
It's settled.

617
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:56,080
20 funny, fill your life with laughter and love.

618
00:26:56,080 --> 00:26:58,560
Head on over to mackleroymerch.com

619
00:26:58,560 --> 00:27:00,400
and get your 20 funny,

620
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:01,920
fill your life with laughter and love.

621
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:08,000
Swag.

622
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:17,280
Hey, this is Griffin.

623
00:27:17,280 --> 00:27:18,560
I'm gonna do these ads myself

624
00:27:18,560 --> 00:27:21,280
because we recorded this one a long time ago

625
00:27:21,280 --> 00:27:22,400
and didn't do the ads then.

626
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:23,680
So I'm gonna do them now

627
00:27:23,680 --> 00:27:25,440
and you're gonna hear them later

628
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:26,560
because that's how time works.

629
00:27:26,560 --> 00:27:27,760
Here's one for Stitch Fix.

630
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:29,600
They're the ones with the box of clothes

631
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:30,800
that they send to your house

632
00:27:30,800 --> 00:27:34,000
and you try them on and you smell them,

633
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:35,120
you huff them deeply.

634
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:37,040
You have a personal stylist

635
00:27:37,040 --> 00:27:38,880
that you answer a few questions

636
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:41,200
and then they will send you some clothes

637
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:42,400
that's gonna match your body

638
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:44,000
and your style and your fashions

639
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:46,480
and shipping and exchanges and returns

640
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:47,760
are always free

641
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:50,480
and the $20 styling fee is automatically applies

642
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:52,240
where it's anything you keep from your box.

643
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:55,600
It's a great little box, folks.

644
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:58,080
Not all boxes are full of fresh clothes.

645
00:27:58,080 --> 00:28:03,680
A lot of boxes are gonna have styrofoam in it

646
00:28:03,680 --> 00:28:06,160
or hey, here's a big box

647
00:28:06,160 --> 00:28:09,840
and this box is just full of printer paper

648
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:10,960
and that's a bad box.

649
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:12,160
Nobody wants that.

650
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:13,760
This box has a fresh shirt in it

651
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:15,120
and it's from Stitch Fix.

652
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:15,920

697
00:29:56,400 --> 00:29:57,680
My spring semester of college

698
00:29:57,680 --> 00:29:58,800
is coming up in about a month

699
00:29:58,800 --> 00:30:00,240
I'm getting my textbooks

700
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:01,680
all right we'll get off your back about it

701
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:04,880
one of the textbooks is labeled as recommended

702
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:06,160
rather than required

703
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:08,880
should I buy the recommended textbook

704
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:13,120
or do most people manage just fine without it

705
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:14,080
you'll be okay

706
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:16,720
I would really appreciate your advice

707
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:17,520
happy new year

708
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:19,600
that's from Alexis Ganner Wisconsin

709
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:22,400
Alexis you have asked this question

710
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:23,920
of a man who in college

711
00:30:23,920 --> 00:30:25,840
much to his shame and discredit

712
00:30:26,800 --> 00:30:28,800
went to the radio station our dad worked at

713
00:30:28,800 --> 00:30:31,440
and zero copied an entire biology textbook

714
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:33,600
to keep from having

715
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:35,440
and then returned it to the bookstore

716
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:35,760
nice

717
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:36,720
this is here

718
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:37,920
this is the kind of people

719
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:39,120
why would that be shameful

720
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:39,760
that's great

721
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:42,960
you know it's bad for somebody along the lines

722
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:43,760
getting ripped off

723
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:45,680
books are hard enough to write

724
00:30:45,680 --> 00:30:47,280
without somebody photocopying them

725
00:30:47,280 --> 00:30:48,080
here's the thing

726
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:49,760
and this is coming from a place

727
00:30:50,160 --> 00:30:54,640
of absolutely no research or experience or knowledge

728
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:55,920
perfect perfect

729
00:30:55,920 --> 00:30:58,960
but why are textbooks so dang dang expensive

730
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:00,320
that's great stuff

731
00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:00,880
you know

732
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:01,520
fucking get it dude

733
00:31:01,520 --> 00:31:03,920
it's like I could buy a book

734
00:31:03,920 --> 00:31:05,040
I could go

735
00:31:05,040 --> 00:31:05,520
go on

736
00:31:05,520 --> 00:31:07,360
I can go to Barnes & Noble

737
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:07,840
right

738
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:08,160
there you go

739
00:31:08,160 --> 00:31:09,600
and get a reference book

740
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:11,120
how much does it cost to get a trap

741
00:31:11,680 --> 00:31:13,520
here's all the bugs

742
00:31:13,520 --> 00:31:14,560
right here's a book

743
00:31:14,560 --> 00:31:15,600
clear the aisle folks

744
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:17,200
it's a book about bugs

745
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:19,520
about bugs and what 30 bucks

746
00:31:19,520 --> 00:31:21,040
trap 40 bucks

747
00:31:21,040 --> 00:31:22,400
he's about to go off

748
00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:23,200
he's about to nut

749
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:26,720
but then I go to the university bookstore

750
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:28,400
to get a book about bugs

751
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:31,680
and it's a hundred and eighty six dollars

752
00:31:31,680 --> 00:31:33,760
and forty two cents

753
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:34,320
please hammer don't hurt him

754
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:36,800
are you telling me there's more bugs

755
00:31:36,800 --> 00:31:38,720
in that university book

756
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:40,880
than in the book at Barnes & Noble

757
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:42,320
I don't think so

758
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:46,640
Justin that sound sucks shit

759
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:48,000
no that was the wrong one let me try again

760
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:50,240
thank you

761
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:51,040
that's not much

762
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:52,960
this is Seinfeld for bugs

763
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:55,600
can I go ahead and send Justin his award

764
00:31:55,600 --> 00:32:00,000
for having the most low quality Seinfeld stinger

765
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,800
my man's working with some fucking like

766
00:32:02,800 --> 00:32:03,920
one kilobyte

767
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:07,840
it sounds like you just opened a birthday card

768
00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:09,280
about Seinfeld

769
00:32:09,280 --> 00:32:11,280
and that's what played when you opened it

770
00:32:11,280 --> 00:32:15,360
it is a fully lost audio codec file

771
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:17,600
it is so fucked up that file

772
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:20,160
that's the Seinfeld theme that aliens hear

773
00:32:20,160 --> 00:32:22,240
when that finally reaches them

774
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:24,160
across the expansive space

775
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:26,560
yeah I got you guys

776
00:32:26,560 --> 00:32:27,360
it's bad

777
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:30,240
you don't need this book though

778
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:31,200
what if it's a test

779
00:32:32,160 --> 00:32:34,320
it's not gonna be a test though

780
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:36,080
hey have you guys ever thought about

781
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:37,040
dead post society

782
00:32:37,040 --> 00:32:39,120
when they tear those pages out of that books

783
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:40,640
those kids are gotta be thinking like

784
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:42,800
I spent a hundred and fifty dollars on this book

785
00:32:42,800 --> 00:32:44,320
it's fucking called privilege man

786
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:46,400
oh dang got it

787
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:47,760

788
00:32:49,280 --> 00:32:50,960
it's everything's online

789
00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:53,520
the whole thing's on the internet

790
00:32:53,520 --> 00:32:55,040
the whole thing is

791
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:56,560
if I google what are the bugs

792
00:32:57,200 --> 00:32:59,040
it's just gonna it's gonna pop up

793
00:32:59,040 --> 00:33:00,880
you don't need this optional book

794
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:01,680
it's optional

795
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:04,400
I once in college

796
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:06,480
it was like one of those government classes

797
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:08,320
you know poly psych class everyone has to take

798
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:11,840
and there was like probably 200 people in the class

799
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:13,040
and the professor got up

800
00:33:13,040 --> 00:33:15,120
and started asking questions about the reading

801
00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:17,120
and like the first five people he pointed to

802
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:19,840
like didn't do the reading

803
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:21,920
and he said did anybody do the reading

804
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:23,760
raise your hands if you did the reading

805
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:25,200
and nobody raised their hands

806
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:27,200
including myself if I'm being honest

807
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:29,200
and he just went fuck

808
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:30,720
and walked out of the room

809
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:32,480
at which point the TA then said

810
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:34,400
uh I guess classes cancelled

811
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:36,320
please do the reading before next class

812
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:39,520
and it was never mentioned again by the professor

813
00:33:39,520 --> 00:33:40,800
didn't come up anymore

814
00:33:40,800 --> 00:33:43,120
never asked any more questions about the reading

815
00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:46,000
so did everybody in class simultaneously

816
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:47,280
pull out their skateboards

817
00:33:47,280 --> 00:33:48,400
and grind out of the room

818
00:33:49,920 --> 00:33:51,760
was this the next time he came and sat down

819
00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:53,440
there were 30 whoopee cushions

820
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:54,960
he couldn't even get into the chair

821
00:33:55,520 --> 00:33:57,280
maybe you shouldn't have accepted tenure

822
00:33:57,280 --> 00:33:58,400
at cool university

823
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:01,600
that's the sound of grinding

824
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:02,960
well I think it was more just like

825
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:04,480
all the students were like

826
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:06,480
well you haven't ever asked questions

827
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:08,240
about the reading before

828
00:34:08,240 --> 00:34:09,120
and let's be honest

829
00:34:09,120 --> 00:34:10,960
we're like 19 yeah

830
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:12,640
and it's could

831
00:34:12,640 --> 00:34:14,960
now here Travis McElroy 36

832
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:16,000
he's like god damn it

833
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:17,760
I wish I understood how you know

834
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:19,120
the government worked better

835
00:34:19,120 --> 00:34:20,560
but when I was 19

836
00:34:21,200 --> 00:34:23,680
I was too busy partying

837
00:34:23,680 --> 00:34:25,280
sure how about a yahoo

838
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:26,560
yeah I love that

839
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:27,920
you know what I changed my mind

840
00:34:27,920 --> 00:34:29,200
Alexis buy the book

841
00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:30,400
don't read it now

842
00:34:30,400 --> 00:34:33,680
but hold on to it for the next 17 years

843
00:34:33,680 --> 00:34:34,720
then read it

844
00:34:34,720 --> 00:34:36,800
because that's when you'll appreciate it

845
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:38,960
yes and but they will have discovered

846
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:40,080
so many new bugs

847
00:34:40,080 --> 00:34:41,920
and also a lot of them bugs

848
00:34:41,920 --> 00:34:43,200
ain't gonna be around anymore

849
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:45,280

850
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:47,040

Brandon who asks

855
00:34:55,680 --> 00:34:57,680
what is the best way to smell good

856
00:34:57,680 --> 00:34:58,800
after eating lunch

857
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:02,080
I smell pretty fresh

858
00:35:02,080 --> 00:35:03,040
until I eat lunch

859
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:05,440
every time after I eat lunch in school

860
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:07,600
I think I smell like food

861
00:35:07,600 --> 00:35:08,480
and I hate it

862
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:09,600
how can I solve this

863
00:35:09,600 --> 00:35:11,200
also I'd like I also

864
00:35:12,160 --> 00:35:13,680
I'd like some tips on how to stay fresh

865
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:14,800
the whole entire day

866
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:16,160
thank you for all of your answers

867
00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:19,840

868
00:35:19,840 --> 00:35:21,200
pulse and force

869
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:23,840
if any of you know about these colognes

870
00:35:23,840 --> 00:35:24,720
I would like your opinion

871
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:25,920
on which one smells better

872
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:26,320
thanks

873
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:27,920
so Brandon's kind of looking for

874
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:32,800
an all-day sort of general scent strategy

875
00:35:33,360 --> 00:35:35,440
mean with the the anchor being

876
00:35:36,080 --> 00:35:38,160
he gets that lunch stink

877
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:40,240
that we all know and hate so much

878
00:35:40,240 --> 00:35:42,800
yeah I mean first step

879
00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:45,360
you're going to need some kind of like

880
00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:48,560
let's say maybe vinyl suit

881
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:50,560
okay gloves

882
00:35:51,600 --> 00:35:53,520
go just like full dexter on it

883
00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:55,440
maybe even lay out some plastic sheeting

884
00:35:56,480 --> 00:35:57,520
okay eat your lunch

885
00:35:57,520 --> 00:36:00,240
because clearly however you're eating it

886
00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:02,800
you're doing a very bad job

887
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:03,360
here's the problem

888
00:36:03,360 --> 00:36:05,520
you can get a breaking bad hazmat suit

889
00:36:05,520 --> 00:36:07,280
and wear that while you're eating lunch

890
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:09,440
but where that's more topical than dexter

891
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:10,080
yes thank you

892
00:36:10,640 --> 00:36:14,320
how does the food get through

893
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:16,240
the decontamination layer

894
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:16,800
tubes

895
00:36:19,360 --> 00:36:22,160
but your your osmosis is the problem

896
00:36:22,160 --> 00:36:23,760
is your osmosis in the garlic

897
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:26,400
like once it's internal that's the day

898
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:28,800
well you could do a lot of uh you know

899
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:29,760
a lot of simp

900
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:32,080
like a lot of uh neutral foods

901
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:34,240
oh like what like what

902
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:35,360
Trav what's a neutral food

903
00:36:35,360 --> 00:36:38,880
plain wheat thins

904
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:40,880
uh okay but think about this

905
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:42,880
if you only eat that

906
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:43,280
yeah

907
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:45,200
think of a food where someone said

908
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:46,320
oh that guy

909
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:47,840
oh he smells like wheat thins

910
00:36:47,840 --> 00:36:49,680
like it's maybe worse

911
00:36:49,680 --> 00:36:51,680
it's worse it's bad that's bad

912
00:36:51,680 --> 00:36:53,040
somebody's gonna be like

913
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:55,360
somebody smells like a spicy puttanesca

914
00:36:55,360 --> 00:36:56,960
and it's a strange human smell

915
00:36:56,960 --> 00:36:57,920
but i don't hate it

916
00:36:57,920 --> 00:36:59,680
if that's like that's tony

917
00:36:59,680 --> 00:37:01,200
that's wheat thins tony

918
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:04,480
okay what is a neutral food

919
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:06,640
my man smells like a pantry over there

920
00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:07,440
it's wild

921
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:09,680
plain uncooked pasta

922
00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:12,880
oh just have a little crunchy diversion

923
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:13,440
yeah

924
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:15,600
some of us have become accustomed to that

925
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:17,600
well the question asker didn't

926
00:37:17,600 --> 00:37:19,360
isn't worried about the visuals right

927
00:37:19,360 --> 00:37:20,080
or the sound

928
00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:22,400
only the scent

929
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:23,440
right the smell

930
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:24,960
it's not it's no it's no good

931
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:26,960
and also clearly pulse is better

932
00:37:27,840 --> 00:37:29,360
pulse is better than force

933
00:37:30,080 --> 00:37:30,640
yes

934
00:37:30,640 --> 00:37:32,320
in any scenario

935
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:34,560
also adidas why are you naming your colognes

936
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:36,400
after like x-men powers

937
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:36,640
yeah

938
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:39,520
another good question for adidas

939
00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:41,520
because neither pulse nor force

940
00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:42,960
added to the list

941
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:47,040
neither pulse nor force conjure any kind of olfactory meaning to me

942
00:37:47,840 --> 00:37:48,080
like

943
00:37:48,080 --> 00:37:49,200
pulse pulse does for

944
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:50,240
pulse is like

945
00:37:50,240 --> 00:37:52,960
i'm excrete i'm excreting something

946
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:55,120
in a steady rhythmic manner

947
00:37:55,120 --> 00:37:56,720
oh okay i guess

948
00:37:56,720 --> 00:38:00,000
which is how we all want to exude smell

949
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:01,920
it's pulsating sniff it

950
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:03,440
yeah that's where they're

951
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:05,440
you don't want a big spike of smell

952
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:08,240
you want a slow pulse of smell all day

953
00:38:08,240 --> 00:38:10,800
which i think is what the question asker is looking for

954
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:12,480
i think

955
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:13,760
that

956
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:15,120
the school

957
00:38:16,080 --> 00:38:16,560
shower

958
00:38:17,120 --> 00:38:18,400
as a concept

959
00:38:19,120 --> 00:38:22,400
is so it was antiquated when i was in school

960
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:22,880
yes

961
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:25,200
the fact that they were like go play baseball

962
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:27,360
and i was like i don't want to play baseball

963
00:38:27,360 --> 00:38:30,080
but i'll do it for a for a good grade

964
00:38:30,080 --> 00:38:31,440
for a Klondike bar

965
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:32,400
those are important to me

966
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:35,120
good grades and Klondike bars are both important to me

967
00:38:35,120 --> 00:38:36,880
get nude and wet

968
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:39,040
no that one i'm not gonna do

969
00:38:39,040 --> 00:38:40,800
i'm just gonna go be

970
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:43,360
i'm not going to effort very much at baseball

971
00:38:43,360 --> 00:38:44,880
i'll split the difference

972
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:46,960
that's why i took individual dual sports

973
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:49,840
which included such sports as golf archery

974
00:38:49,840 --> 00:38:51,760
i was a big ping pong fan

975
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:53,040
now let me say this

976
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:56,320
if they had just had the showers

977
00:38:57,200 --> 00:38:58,560
available at school

978
00:38:58,560 --> 00:39:02,320
at school anytime you needed to freshen up

979
00:39:03,600 --> 00:39:05,280
i wouldn't have used them still back then

980
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:08,000
but nowadays like that idea resonates with me

981
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:10,160
these days i don't want to always shower

982
00:39:10,160 --> 00:39:12,160
right when i wake up first thing in the morning

983
00:39:12,160 --> 00:39:14,320
because i don't know what kind of stinky business

984
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:16,160
i'm going to get into that day

985
00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:16,720
right

986
00:39:16,720 --> 00:39:20,720
yeah now let me eat my let me eat my stinky fucking lunch

987
00:39:20,720 --> 00:39:22,240
and then i'll go have a spritz

988
00:39:22,240 --> 00:39:23,440
and then i'll go rinse off

989
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:25,280
it's also 20 funny

990
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:26,240
are you telling me

991
00:39:26,240 --> 00:39:32,000
me that we don't have the technology to build a like a like a human washing machine

992
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:33,760
like a car wash for humans

993
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:35,760
that i don't need to get nude in

994
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:38,480
a coffin that should blast me

995
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:42,240
i'm just saying i should be able to fully clothed step into it

996
00:39:42,240 --> 00:39:42,480
wait

997
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:45,040
soaks me then powerful dryers

998
00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:45,520
okay

999
00:39:45,520 --> 00:39:47,440
and i step out and i'm totally clean

1000
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:48,160
including my clothes

1001
00:39:48,160 --> 00:39:49,440
because here's the thing Griffin

1002
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:51,920
you eat a powerful stanky lunch right

1003
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:52,800
you get clean

1004
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:55,360
your clothes still smell like the food

1005
00:39:55,360 --> 00:39:57,280
that's possible that's possible

1006
00:39:57,280 --> 00:40:02,080
i do think that there is going to be a funny a 20 funny scenario

1007
00:40:02,080 --> 00:40:04,160
where like i go in there with a wool sweater

1008
00:40:04,160 --> 00:40:04,560
uh-huh

1009
00:40:04,560 --> 00:40:05,360
and then it blasts me

1010
00:40:05,360 --> 00:40:07,360
and then when i come out the sweater is all shrunk down

1011
00:40:07,360 --> 00:40:08,800
everybody sees my abs

1012
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:09,280
yes

1013
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:11,440
and that could be funny though

1014
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:12,800
like it's not necessarily a bad thing

1015
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:14,720
i think you know the risks when you go in there

1016
00:40:14,720 --> 00:40:15,920
and all your clothes get small

1017
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:17,920
and you can step out and be like oh no i have tract disease

1018
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:19,520
or something like funny punchline

1019
00:40:19,520 --> 00:40:22,240
something oh i got big you know

1020
00:40:22,240 --> 00:40:23,760
mint mint

1021
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:29,040
mint like for your whole like for your whole body

1022
00:40:29,600 --> 00:40:30,480
just like a mint

1023
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:32,720
well that's good for the mouth Justin

1024
00:40:32,720 --> 00:40:35,520
what about your face where the food rubbed on your hands

1025
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:38,000
what about my arms and legs where the food rubbed on

1026
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:39,040
because i did drop them

1027
00:40:39,600 --> 00:40:40,160
rub the mint

1028
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:42,160
rub the mint all over the mint

1029
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:43,360
yeah

1030
00:40:43,360 --> 00:40:46,320
all over you and is it too late for 20 rub the minty

1031
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:47,680
that's good

1032
00:40:47,680 --> 00:40:50,640
yeah let me rub let me rub the mint all over my lap

1033
00:40:50,640 --> 00:40:56,480
so i get a good burn going on down there Justin

1034
00:40:56,480 --> 00:40:56,720
what

1035
00:40:56,720 --> 00:40:58,800
this is my this i'm using it now to bail out

1036
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:02,560
not to freshen up the show

1037
00:41:02,560 --> 00:41:03,520
but to save myself

spangles

1055
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:46,320

00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:50,400
and i think it's in Kansas

1058
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:53,440
because this is from the the Wichita Eagle

1059
00:41:53,440 --> 00:41:54,240
this story

1060
00:41:55,840 --> 00:41:57,200
about spangles

1061
00:41:58,240 --> 00:42:00,560
it long ago past its 21st birthday

1062
00:42:00,560 --> 00:42:02,560
it turns 42 in January

99

1067
00:42:08,080 --> 00:42:08,240
i

1068
00:42:09,680 --> 00:42:11,760
this is such a fucking disaster

1069
00:42:12,640 --> 00:42:13,280
so okay

1070
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:14,080
a little background

1071
00:42:14,080 --> 00:42:17,680
spangles looks like a sort of a burger

1072
00:42:17,680 --> 00:42:19,120
and chicken sandwich

1073
00:42:19,120 --> 00:42:21,360
kind of like a almost looks like a

1074
00:42:23,360 --> 00:42:24,160
checkers

1075
00:42:24,160 --> 00:42:24,880
or like a

1076
00:42:26,080 --> 00:42:27,360
carl's juniors

1077
00:42:27,360 --> 00:42:28,960
you know in that neck of the woods

1078
00:42:28,960 --> 00:42:30,240
you know maybe like a rallies

1079
00:42:30,240 --> 00:42:30,960
that kind of vibe right

1080
00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:31,680
that is checkers

1081
00:42:31,680 --> 00:42:32,720
you can't say it twice

1082
00:42:32,720 --> 00:42:32,960
okay

1083
00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:35,200
thank you

1084
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:39,600
so the chain is adding 99 cent margaritas

1085
00:42:39,600 --> 00:42:41,200
and screwdrivers

1086
00:42:41,200 --> 00:42:42,800
to its menu on Friday

1087
00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:45,440
at a rest at its restaurant near 21st and Woodlawn

1088
00:42:46,080 --> 00:42:47,520
here's a quote from Dale Steven

1089
00:42:48,080 --> 00:42:50,560
who co-owns Spangle with his brother Craig

1090
00:42:51,280 --> 00:42:52,240
sound like fun guys

1091
00:42:52,880 --> 00:42:53,840
we're just gonna do

1092
00:42:54,480 --> 00:42:57,360
one store to work out the little training and kinks

1093
00:42:57,920 --> 00:43:00,720
after that we will implement it in all the stores

1094
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:06,160
the impetus for drinks comes from increasing fast casual competitors that serve alcohol

1095
00:43:06,720 --> 00:43:08,640
this is another quote from Dale Steven

1096
00:43:08,640 --> 00:43:11,520
you can't go anywhere with your family that doesn't have alcohol

1097
00:43:11,520 --> 00:43:15,600
the steven's remedy to that is not to try to make a

1098
00:43:17,120 --> 00:43:18,400
he doesn't try to make a

1099
00:43:19,040 --> 00:43:20,400
a refuge

1100
00:43:20,400 --> 00:43:22,320
he's taken out if you can't beat him

1101
00:43:22,320 --> 00:43:23,840
join him kind of a brunch with this

1102
00:43:23,840 --> 00:43:24,880
more than that

1103
00:43:24,880 --> 00:43:26,000
if you can't beat them

1104
00:43:26,960 --> 00:43:28,480
vastly under sell them

1105
00:43:28,480 --> 00:43:31,040
and get them so fucking faded

1106
00:43:31,040 --> 00:43:32,800
that they don't know which way is up

1107
00:43:32,800 --> 00:43:35,040
and they eat three too many burgers

1108
00:43:35,040 --> 00:43:36,320
oh see that felt

1109
00:43:36,320 --> 00:43:37,920
oh see i was going to say

1110
00:43:37,920 --> 00:43:38,960
it felt a little more like

1111
00:43:38,960 --> 00:43:39,920
Dale was saying like

1112
00:43:39,920 --> 00:43:44,560
everyone i go i don't go anywhere with my family that doesn't have alcohol

1113
00:43:44,560 --> 00:43:46,640
yeah i couldn't go to my own restaurant

1114
00:43:46,640 --> 00:43:47,680
and it was shameful

1115
00:43:47,680 --> 00:43:49,120
but now i can

1116
00:43:49,120 --> 00:43:52,160
because you couldn't get a alcohol at fast food restaurants

1117
00:43:52,160 --> 00:43:53,680
except now you can

1118
00:43:53,680 --> 00:43:54,720
for 99

1119
00:43:55,840 --> 00:43:58,000
we're always trying to be unique

1120
00:43:58,000 --> 00:43:59,040
Steven says

1121
00:43:59,040 --> 00:44:02,560
there's just a whole list of things that we always try to be the first at

1122
00:44:02,560 --> 00:44:07,440
apparently this this checks off uh getting people fucking plowed

1123
00:44:07,440 --> 00:44:10,320
for no money

1124
00:44:10,320 --> 00:44:10,820
now

1125
00:44:12,240 --> 00:44:14,560
Spangles has done drive-thru business in the evenings

1126
00:44:14,560 --> 00:44:16,000
but not much dine-in business

1127
00:44:16,640 --> 00:44:19,760
quote it kind of leaves a lobby that could use some excitement

1128
00:44:20,400 --> 00:44:22,800
in the evenings all fast foods are relatively so

1129
00:44:22,800 --> 00:44:25,600
oh Steven i think things are about to get mighty exciting

1130
00:44:27,040 --> 00:44:29,760
dude get your ass to Spangles

1131
00:44:29,760 --> 00:44:31,440
we are getting fucked up tonight

1132
00:44:31,440 --> 00:44:34,480
yeah we're going to Spangles for Doug's bachelor party

1133
00:44:34,480 --> 00:44:37,600
holy shit Doug's gonna die

1134
00:44:37,600 --> 00:44:39,680
he thinks drinks could be a draw

1135
00:44:39,680 --> 00:44:41,840
quote it's a dine-in only product

1136
00:44:41,840 --> 00:44:43,680
no fucking shit Dale

1137
00:44:43,680 --> 00:44:48,240
Dale are you telling me you don't have the world's first drive-thru margarita window

1138
00:44:49,360 --> 00:44:51,840
that seems like a choice a choice idea

1139
00:44:51,840 --> 00:44:54,720
just cruise on through and get marked from the road

1140
00:44:54,720 --> 00:44:58,320
if it's the morning times treat yourself to a screwdriver

1141
00:44:58,320 --> 00:45:00,800
dig into your between the car seats

1142
00:45:00,800 --> 00:45:03,520
pull out enough money to buy three screwdrivers

1143
00:45:03,520 --> 00:45:04,400
it's party time

1144
00:45:05,280 --> 00:45:09,280
um this okay i i'm actually this is like different for us

1145
00:45:09,280 --> 00:45:14,960
but um um the quotes in this story get so wet and wild

1146
00:45:15,520 --> 00:45:16,960
i'm gonna share this

1147
00:45:17,520 --> 00:45:21,200
Griffin i'm gonna shoot this to your slack if you can

1148
00:45:21,760 --> 00:45:25,520
and will you just read the quotes and i'll read the story parts okay

1149
00:45:25,520 --> 00:45:26,960
this is how it's written down in the story

1150
00:45:26,960 --> 00:45:29,520
so like a call and response like we're in church

1151
00:45:29,520 --> 00:45:31,520
but this is how it's written in the story

1152
00:45:31,520 --> 00:45:34,400
okay he says

1153
00:45:34,400 --> 00:45:38,480
Spangles is known for its orange juice slush so screwdriver slush made sense

1154
00:45:38,480 --> 00:45:42,880
screwdrivers and margaritas including lime and strawberry ones with salt or sugar rims

1155
00:45:42,880 --> 00:45:45,280
are inexpensive and quick to make Stephen said

1156
00:45:45,280 --> 00:45:46,480
we have to be fast

1157
00:45:47,200 --> 00:45:49,120
there won't be beer or wine at this point

1158
00:45:49,120 --> 00:45:50,240
it's down the road

1159
00:45:51,040 --> 00:45:54,560
the margaritas will each be made with one and a half ounces of tequila

1160
00:45:54,560 --> 00:45:56,560
and the screwdrivers will have an ounce of vodka

1161
00:45:56,560 --> 00:45:59,680
it's delicious and it's got plenty of alcohol

1162
00:45:59,680 --> 00:46:03,440
he says that it's clear there's enough alcohol

1163
00:46:03,440 --> 00:46:05,280
the second you sip it

1164
00:46:06,240 --> 00:46:08,160
Stephen said the drinks will be served in

1165
00:46:08,160 --> 00:46:10,240
a heavy duty glass mug

1166
00:46:11,040 --> 00:46:13,360
it's going to be done right

1167
00:46:14,720 --> 00:46:16,240
that's the end of the story

1168
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:22,320
Dale Stephen you're about to fucking bump off in that place

1169
00:46:22,320 --> 00:46:24,800
holy shit does this have alcohol in it

1170
00:46:25,360 --> 00:46:25,920
sip it

1171
00:46:25,920 --> 00:46:29,680
Hey guys, Spanglers is broken bad

1172
00:46:29,680 --> 00:46:33,040
sip it and you shall know the truth

1173
00:46:33,920 --> 00:46:35,920
please if you're near this area

1174
00:46:35,920 --> 00:46:37,120
please hit a wrist Spangles

1175
00:46:37,120 --> 00:46:39,600
and send us a picture of the smoking wreckage

1176
00:46:40,960 --> 00:46:44,800
when they start getting people plowed on 99 cent margaritas

1177
00:46:44,800 --> 00:46:45,520
god bless

1178
00:46:46,240 --> 00:46:47,760
it's delicious though

1179
00:46:47,760 --> 00:46:50,000
and it does got plenty of alcohol

1180
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:52,480
approximately one and one half ounces

1181
00:46:52,480 --> 00:46:54,320
enough to sip it and know

1182
00:46:54,320 --> 00:46:56,240
at least the mugs are heavy duty

1183
00:46:56,240 --> 00:46:58,400
so that when they are thrown frequently

1184
00:46:58,400 --> 00:47:01,520
they will do tremendous ballistic damage

1185
00:47:02,560 --> 00:47:04,160
when they're tossed at your server

1186
00:47:04,160 --> 00:47:06,640
for not bringing the mustard fast enough

1187
00:47:06,640 --> 00:47:08,400
because you're fucking drunk

1188
00:47:09,440 --> 00:47:10,160
oh boy

1189
00:47:10,160 --> 00:47:13,840
and demanding mustard for a mustard magic trick

1190
00:47:13,840 --> 00:47:16,640
your buddy says he knows how to do

1191
00:47:16,640 --> 00:47:20,160
if only that fucking waitress would bring the fucking mustard already

1192
00:47:20,160 --> 00:47:22,720
this mustard trick is going to really quote

1193
00:47:22,720 --> 00:47:24,400
blow your ass apart

1194
00:47:24,400 --> 00:47:24,720
wow

1195
00:47:27,920 --> 00:47:28,400
oh boy

1196
00:47:29,360 --> 00:47:30,400
we want to be the first

1197
00:47:31,280 --> 00:47:32,320
first with margaritas

1198
00:47:32,320 --> 00:47:32,960
well

1199
00:47:32,960 --> 00:47:34,720
first to have an on-site murder

1200
00:47:34,720 --> 00:47:36,160
first Spangles location

1201
00:47:37,280 --> 00:47:39,920
that's also that's the kinks they're gonna work out

1202
00:47:39,920 --> 00:47:42,240
like hey so uh we're just gonna do it

1203
00:47:42,240 --> 00:47:45,040
in what we're calling our most expendable store

1204
00:47:49,840 --> 00:47:52,000
I feel bad for those people who are on the

1205
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:54,400
the uh the the slab there

1206
00:47:54,400 --> 00:47:55,920
for the first time

1207
00:47:55,920 --> 00:47:56,880
hey boss

1208
00:47:56,880 --> 00:47:57,120
hey

1209
00:47:57,120 --> 00:47:58,480
we just got the menus printed

1210
00:47:58,480 --> 00:48:00,320
it says 99 cents

1211
00:48:00,320 --> 00:48:01,600
that can't be it right

1212
00:48:01,600 --> 00:48:02,720
this can't be right

1213
00:48:02,720 --> 00:48:03,600
hey boss

1214
00:48:03,600 --> 00:48:05,760
it's our first night of this promotion

1215
00:48:05,760 --> 00:48:06,800
I did want to ask

1216
00:48:06,800 --> 00:48:08,720
how many windows do you have

1217
00:48:09,440 --> 00:48:11,200
at your house kind of saved

1218
00:48:11,200 --> 00:48:12,800
to replace the windows here

1219
00:48:12,800 --> 00:48:14,480
because we're on our third window already

1220
00:48:14,480 --> 00:48:15,280
we just want to just

1221
00:48:15,280 --> 00:48:18,640
can we get some chicken wire up in front of the registers

1222
00:48:18,640 --> 00:48:21,040
can you just fucking like roadhouse

1223
00:48:21,040 --> 00:48:22,800
this entire establishment

1224
00:48:22,800 --> 00:48:23,680
that would be great

1225
00:48:23,680 --> 00:48:25,120
could you get us a chiller fleet

1226
00:48:25,120 --> 00:48:26,400
no not a refrigerator

1227
00:48:26,400 --> 00:48:29,440
somebody to cool out kind of when the fights happen

1228
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:32,560
thanks y'all for for hanging out with us

1229
00:48:32,560 --> 00:48:34,320
uh welcome to 20 funny

1230
00:48:34,880 --> 00:48:37,440
uh we are so happy to

1231
00:48:37,440 --> 00:48:39,040
that you've stayed with us for

1232
00:48:40,240 --> 00:48:43,840
uh it'll be a decade this year

1233
00:48:43,840 --> 00:48:46,080
it'll be uh this April

1234
00:48:46,080 --> 00:48:48,880
will mark the 10th anniversary of my brother my brother me

1235
00:48:48,880 --> 00:48:49,600
as improbable

1236
00:48:49,600 --> 00:48:50,560
so wild

1237
00:48:50,560 --> 00:48:51,440
as that may be

1238
00:48:51,440 --> 00:48:54,400
so thank you for for your continued indulgence

1239
00:48:54,400 --> 00:48:55,760
uh I I also want to say

1240
00:48:55,760 --> 00:49:00,480
so as of recording this uh we have not had a baby yet

1241
00:49:00,480 --> 00:49:01,280
my wife and I

1242
00:49:01,280 --> 00:49:02,400
we bought a baby

1243
00:49:02,400 --> 00:49:03,440
it's a boy

1244
00:49:03,440 --> 00:49:07,200
by any day now that baby is going to be born

1245
00:49:07,200 --> 00:49:10,800
and that's probably going to chunk up the release schedule a little bit

1246
00:49:10,800 --> 00:49:12,080
and kind of I don't know

Hi I'm Allie Gertz

1310
00:52:05,840 --> 00:52:07,040
And I'm Julia Prescott

1311
00:52:07,040 --> 00:52:09,280
And we host Round Springfield

1312
00:52:09,280 --> 00:52:14,160
Round Springfield is a new Simpsons podcast that is Simpsons adjacent

1313
00:52:14,960 --> 00:52:18,480
in its topic we talk to Simpsons writers directors

1314
00:52:18,480 --> 00:52:20,480
voiceover actors you name it

1315
00:52:20,480 --> 00:52:22,960
about non-Simpsons things that they've done

1316
00:52:22,960 --> 00:52:26,640
because surprise they're all extremely talented

1317
00:52:26,640 --> 00:52:29,760
absolutely for example David X Cohen worked on the Simpsons

1318
00:52:29,760 --> 00:52:32,400
but then created a little show called Futurama

1319
00:52:32,400 --> 00:52:34,000
that's our very first episode

1320
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:37,680
so tune in for stuff like that with Yardley Smith with Tim Long with different writers

1321
00:52:37,680 --> 00:52:39,440
and voice actors it's gonna be so much fun

1322
00:52:39,440 --> 00:52:42,400
and we are every other week on Maximumfun.org

1323
00:52:42,400 --> 00:53:04,400
or wherever you get your podcasts
