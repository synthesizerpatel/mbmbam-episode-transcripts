1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on the wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there will know how cool they are for listening.

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:43,000
What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Hell yeah!

6
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,000
What up?

7
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
What's up?

8
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Who brought the cheer wine?

9
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Who brought the...

10
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Yeah!

11
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Nice.

12
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Good looking out.

13
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,000
How's Florida?

14
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Holy shit!

15
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,000
This guy...

16
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Did everybody hear that?

17
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,000
I hope you all feel bad about yourself.

18
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,000
This guy drove 20...

19
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,000
30 hours to be here today.

20
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Do you want to start the show, Justin?

21
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
My name is Justin McElroy.

22
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy.

23
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,000
I...

24
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Hold on a second.

25
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,000
I didn't...

26
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,000
You know what?

27
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,000
I hadn't started recording yet.

28
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,000
This time, for sure.

29
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Should we start?

30
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Should we walk out again?

31
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Yeah, we can.

32
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Well, we can.

33
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,000
We can.

34
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,000
We can.

35
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,000
We can.

36
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,000
We can.

37
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,000
We can.

38
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,000
We can.

39
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,000
We can.

40
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
We can.

41
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Yeah, we can.

42
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Welcome to My Brother, My Brother, Me, and My Show for the Moderna Era.

43
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,000
I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy.

44
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I'm your middle-est brother, Travis McElroy.

45
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Sweet, sweet baby Griffin McElroy.

46
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:32,080
Let me just jack into the Matrix real quick.

47
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:39,000
So, thank you all for coming to our comedy advice podcast.

48
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,920
You're here in New York.

49
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:45,480
This is our first time doing My Brother, My Brother, Me here in...

50
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:46,840
in New York City.

51
00:01:48,380 --> 00:01:51,120
Here are the big Snapple.

52
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:53,040
I came over that earlier, it's good, right?

53
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:55,660
Oh, my god, he is not joking.

54
00:01:55,660 --> 00:01:57,060
He was.

55
00:01:57,060 --> 00:01:58,420
I was so excited about it,

56
00:01:58,420 --> 00:01:59,620
and I told everyone in our group.

57
00:01:59,620 --> 00:02:01,080
He was word shopping that

58
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:03,240
on the street a couple hours ago.

59
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:05,380
And by word shopping I mean he said it once

60
00:02:05,380 --> 00:02:09,620
and nobody laughed or responded to it in any way.

61
00:02:09,620 --> 00:02:11,700
Dog pound, I swear to god, he says,

62
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:13,560
this is my, this is the dog pound.

63
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:19,560
I should have said it was like the Greek chorus thing.

64
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:21,560
Excellent joke.

65
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:30,560
We were walking and we had not heard the beginning of the conversation because we got split up by the intersection.

66
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:34,560
And we catch up with him and he says, hey guys, big snapper.

67
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:44,560
Just so you know, the beginning of the conversation was, there's so much to do and see here in the big snapper.

68
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:50,560
So I didn't miss. No, well, I felt like you didn't really get it.

69
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:54,560
This is a randy audience, can I say that?

70
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:56,560
You guys are a little randy.

71
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:58,560
You guys are very productive.

72
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:01,560
And what's funny is I know you're not drunk because you all stood outside.

73
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:04,560
There's a bar, you guys could have chilled in.

74
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:10,560
And what I love is that you waited in line outside where it's like, I don't know, it's outside so that's not ideal.

75
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:17,560
And the reason that you were waiting in line from what we were told was because you wanted to get the best seats that you possibly could.

76
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:21,560
Which is great because it means you're like, your fans, and that's obviously very flattering.

77
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:24,560
But it also means that you're very polite and you understand how lines work.

78
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:27,560
And you don't throw yourself in a crowd and fist fight each other.

79
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:33,560
You must have been surprised when you got in here and realized there wasn't a single seat you couldn't spit on us from.

80
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:36,560
There were also just three dudes sitting at the table.

81
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:39,560
So I don't know what you were afraid you wouldn't see.

82
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:43,560
They were afraid they missed our electric light show.

83
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:45,560
Lasers. Can we activate our...

84
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:47,560
Can we cue the show for them?

85
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:49,560
Yeah.

86
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:51,560
Hey audience at home.

87
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:53,560
I should have bought a ticket.

88
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:57,560
You didn't get a ticket because you waited a minute and a half.

89
00:03:57,560 --> 00:03:59,560
Again, you guys are crazy. Thank you very, very much.

90
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:01,560
Let's start doing questions.

91
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:03,560
Oh, by the way.

92
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:05,560
Oh man.

93
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:07,560
Jinx.

94
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:09,560
Now that we can't talk, listen to me.

95
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:11,560
This is a shitty show.

96
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:13,560
Bitch, you just talked.

97
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:16,560
We may, if we have time, we may do a couple of questions for people here.

98
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:18,560
So think if we have a good one.

99
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:21,560
Not like a bad one because we will get a freaking problem.

100
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:24,560
Nothing about wanting to have sex with your friend's girlfriend.

101
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:26,560
Or dog.

102
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:28,560
Or car.

103
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:30,560
Or garbage compactor.

104
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:32,560
I don't know why you'd want to have sex with garbage compactor.

105
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:34,560
Trash free.

106
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:36,560
Okay, great.

107
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:39,560
So these first couple of questions are from people that are hypothetically here.

108
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:41,560
So feel free to raise your hand.

109
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:43,560
I won't be able to see you, but sure.

110
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:45,560
I'm from the Midwest and since moving to New York,

111
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:48,560
I've heard that Dime Mountain Dew is a broke ass

112
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:51,560
or trashy soft drink.

113
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:53,560
Is this true?

114
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:55,560
Am I drinking a soda that will make me look trashy?

115
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:57,560
That's from John Wagner. John, are you here?

116
00:04:57,560 --> 00:04:59,560
I'm here.

117
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:01,560
I'm from the Dog Tale.

118
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:03,560
John Wagner.

119
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:06,560
Hold on, let me figure this out because it's like what a dog tale is.

120
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:10,560
He can't think if you laugh.

121
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:16,560
Which explains a lot, John.

122
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:20,560
Is that like a Midwest?

123
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:22,560
I mean, I know, Justin, it's your, like,

124
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:24,560
I know you're big on Pepsi Max now.

125
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:26,560
Yeah, I weigh into Pepsi Max.

126
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:28,560
I was into Dime Mountain Dew for a while.

127
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:31,560
When I was, this was like actually caught me by surprise.

128
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:34,560
Because where we grew up,

129
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:37,560
what I had associated Mountain Dew with

130
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:40,560
was what the copious amounts of advertising I'd seen associated with,

131
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:43,560
which is like extreme sports.

132
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:45,560
So I think if you're doing Mountain Dew, you're doing the Dew.

133
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:49,560
You're probably shredding or carving, maybe.

134
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:52,560
Wind jamming.

135
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:57,560
My friend, Michael Beth, I met him from college and he was from Ohio.

136
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:02,560
Let's hear it for Ohio!

137
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:04,560
Dayton, more specifically.

138
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:11,560
Who has any feelings about Dayton positive or negative?

139
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:15,560
And we were drinking Mountain Dew and we offered him one and he said,

140
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:17,560
Oh no, my mother says...

141
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:18,560
That's what he sounds like?

142
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:19,560
Yeah, it's not a joke.

143
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:20,560
Justin's not doing his, like, jokes.

144
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:23,560
He sounds like Kemo Phillips having a stroke.

145
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:27,560
Oh no, my mother says that Mountain Dew is for briars.

146
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:33,560
That story's so much funnier if you know Michael Beck, which nobody here does.

147
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:36,560
Let's hear it for Michael Beck!

148
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:41,560
Briars was another term that I was not familiar with,

149
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:43,560
but apparently it means hill people.

150
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:51,560
I heard a theory online that if you spill Mountain Dew or Diet Mountain Dew on the sidewalk,

151
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:54,560
the puddle that it forms, no matter how you spill it,

152
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:58,560
or the weather effects that it might have on the spill,

153
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:01,560
it will splash down in the perfect shape of the state of West Virginia.

154
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:04,560
It's true. Look online. Google search that.

155
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:07,560
Every time. Perfect. Two panhandles.

156
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:10,560
The West Coast.

157
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:13,560
It's a coast. It's on a river.

158
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:14,560
Sure.

159
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:16,560
You want to know my geography more?

160
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:18,560
Well, so my other question is the other side of that.

161
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:22,560
Is there a soda you could drink that makes you look like the classiest fellow?

162
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:23,560
Is there a soda?

163
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:24,560
Yeah.

164
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:27,560
Like if you're drinking Diet Cheer wine and someone goes,

165
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:29,560
How sophisticated.

166
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:30,560
I feel like, what about...

167
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:32,560
Jones? Jones sodas?

168
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:33,560
That's something that...

169
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:34,560
That's pretty good.

170
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:35,560
I'm pretty good.

171
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:37,560
I drinked it.

172
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:38,560
No, you're right.

173
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:39,560
That's what I know too.

174
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:42,560
They were like small batch root beers? Is that a thing?

175
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:43,560
Yeah.

176
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:44,560
Oh.

177
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:46,560
Micro brew root beers?

178
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:47,560
Get out.

179
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:48,560
Did I make that?

180
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:49,560
I thought I created that in my mind's eye.

181
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:50,560
No.

182
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:54,560
Do you guys want to ask him a question?

183
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:55,560
Oh, do you?

184
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:56,560
Yeah.

185
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:58,560
Yeah.

186
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:00,560
I'm going to give you regular questions only.

187
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:01,560
I have three choices.

188
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:09,560
This Yahoo answer was sent in by Himmel member and level 8 Yahoo Shaman,

189
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:10,560
Drew Davenport.

190
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:11,560
Thank you, Drew.

191
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:16,560
It's by Yahoo Answers user Bulls Cubs Fan who asks,

192
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:21,560
Is a loveseat called a loveseat because people have sex on it?

193
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:26,560
But I love how that question is.

194
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:28,560
It would imply that they couldn't come up with a name

195
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:30,560
and they like field tested it.

196
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:31,560
I put two people on.

197
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:32,560
Whoa.

198
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:35,560
Holy shit.

199
00:08:35,560 --> 00:08:36,560
All right.

200
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:37,560
Loveseat it is.

201
00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:41,560
That's the fucks over for sure.

202
00:08:41,560 --> 00:08:46,560
I don't think we can sell those at the big Sandy Superstore.

203
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:49,560
Our branding expert wasn't even out of the room.

204
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:53,560
Our brand Shaman Skylar hadn't even left the room yet

205
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:55,560
before you started having sex on it.

206
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:00,560
Did they know each other before this?

207
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:03,560
No, the power of the sofa, sir.

208
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:09,560
Etymologic or entomologic, one of those two, strictly speaking.

209
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:11,560
Etymomically.

210
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:13,560
It has to have something to do with it, right?

211
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:14,560
Etymomically speaking.

212
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:16,560
You can only fit two people on there.

213
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:17,560
Sorry?

214
00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:19,560
You can only fit two people on it.

215
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:20,560
Two regular people?

216
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:21,560
Yeah.

217
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:23,560
One big person, three little people.

218
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:24,560
Cheat the chart.

219
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:26,560
Yeah, a million borrowers.

220
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:27,560
What are we doing?

221
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:34,560
I've been watching a lot of my 600 pound life

222
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:36,560
and I don't want you to say they aren't people

223
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:39,560
because you cannot fit two normal loveseats.

224
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:40,560
That's fair, great.

225
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:41,560
And you wouldn't want to

226
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:42,560
because they'd initially start having sex

227
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:45,560
and go, thank you, check please.

228
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:48,560
Or you'd rather not.

229
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:49,560
Oh, boy.

230
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:51,560
I don't think that would be a comfortable platform

231
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:53,560
for that experience.

232
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:55,560
Well, do you think that it started off as like they

233
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:58,560
first said, hey, two people, which of these

234
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:00,560
would you choose to have sex on?

235
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:01,560
And it was like a Goldilocks kind of thing?

236
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:03,560
Like they tried it in a recliner and they're like,

237
00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:04,560
oh, no, no, no, no.

238
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:05,560
And then they did it on a couch.

239
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:06,560
Like, how can I even reach them?

240
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:07,560
They're so far away.

241
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:11,560
They were trying to have sex.

242
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:12,560
I don't even know what to do with it.

243
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:14,560
And then they got on a loveseat and said, yes.

244
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:15,560
This is it.

245
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:17,560
They originally were trying to have sex on the couch.

246
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:19,560
Oh, this is going to be a fucking great reference.

247
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:20,560
Fuck it, everybody.

248
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:23,560
From the Gallagher live stage show.

249
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:25,560
But then they found John Lacherio's

250
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:27,560
and started having sex.

251
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:29,560
We can't have sex here.

252
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:30,560
Gallagher is out there.

253
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:32,560
Gallagher has touched this.

254
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:34,560
I don't want to have sex on the couch.

255
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:36,560
And Gallagher's over there masturbating.

256
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:41,560
They all pictured it, didn't they?

257
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:43,560
That sentence is out there.

258
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:45,560
That's why everybody in the first year

259
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:46,560
has those plastic wraps.

260
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:53,560
Is Gallagher here tonight?

261
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:55,560
Oh, Gallagher 2 is.

262
00:10:57,560 --> 00:11:00,560
No big Gallagher 2 fans?

263
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:02,560
All right, next question.

264
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:04,560
I recently decided to move in with a friend of mine

265
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:06,560
and all seems to be going well so far.

266
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:08,560
My issue comes from when we signed the lease.

267
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:10,560
I had come to the lease signing prepared

268
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:11,560
to pay for my half of the deposit,

269
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:13,560
only to find that my roommate had decided

270
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:15,560
to pay the entire amount.

271
00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:16,560
My question now is,

272
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:17,560
what do I do with the money

273
00:11:17,560 --> 00:11:18,560
I would have spent on the deposit?

274
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:21,560
Am I required to spend it on stuff for the apartment?

275
00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:23,560
And if so, what should I spend it on?

276
00:11:23,560 --> 00:11:25,560
And that's from Suddenly Affluent in Astoria.

277
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:26,560
Are you here?

278
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:27,560
Right there.

279
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:28,560
All right.

280
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:30,560
I mean, you're a thief.

281
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:35,560
I've never rented a New York apartment,

282
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:41,560
but I imagine the deposit is like $14,000.

283
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:43,560
But I mean, you got away with it.

284
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:44,560
Until now?

285
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:46,560
Until like 30 seconds ago.

286
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:47,560
Perfect crime.

287
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:48,560
It was the perfect crime

288
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:51,560
and then it was the shittiest crime.

289
00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:53,560
Well, here's the catch.

290
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:57,560
Your roommate will get that deposit back hypothetically

291
00:11:57,560 --> 00:12:00,560
and you will not get money back for whatever you are.

292
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:01,560
So you need to think less about

293
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:03,560
what you're going to spend your stolen money on

294
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:05,560
and more about like,

295
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:09,560
you can do all kinds of wack shit in this apartment.

296
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:11,560
You need to start kicking holes in the wall,

297
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:14,560
burn the carpet, whatever you need to do.

298
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:16,560
You no longer have a horse in this race.

299
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:19,560
Whatever the condition is, is what it is.

300
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:22,560
Oh, you can hang a bunch of shelves?

301
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:25,560
Repaint the wall and mix sawdust into the paint

302
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:27,560
and get a nice textured look.

303
00:12:27,560 --> 00:12:30,560
Welcome to Property Brothers.

304
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:32,560
They're fucking shit up.

305
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:34,560
You didn't want to sell this again, did you?

306
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:38,560
We're going to put a really nice reclaimed ivy up here.

307
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:39,560
Really support it.

308
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:41,560
You know, really fuck this place up.

309
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:43,560
Really, really fuck it up.

310
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:44,560
They'll never get that up.

311
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:45,560
You didn't pay the deposit on that.

312
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:46,560
Oh, you stole it. Great. Cool.

313
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:47,560
No, you're fine. Yeah, perfect.

314
00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:49,560
We are going to ruin this.

315
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:51,560
We're going to get bathtub on the ceiling.

316
00:12:51,560 --> 00:12:52,560
Yeah.

317
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:53,560
Just cause.

318
00:12:53,560 --> 00:12:54,560
Why not?

319
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:55,560
Fuck it.

320
00:12:55,560 --> 00:12:56,560
Could that help?

321
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:57,560
Try it.

322
00:12:57,560 --> 00:13:00,560
Try to yaboo.

323
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:04,560
Really, you're not going to attempt to help that gentleman.

324
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:06,560
I mean, I wouldn't...

325
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:07,560
Here's the thing.

326
00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:11,560
You have entered into an emotional battlefield.

327
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:14,560
The next few months to years, but let's be honest,

328
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:17,560
months of your life are going to be about the power struggle

329
00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:19,560
between you and this person.

330
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:20,560
You cannot see the victory this early.

331
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:22,560
Here's what you need to do.

332
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:24,560
He's not going to take a check.

333
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:26,560
He's not going to take a stack of cash

334
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:27,560
if he wants to out line around.

335
00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:29,560
What you've got to do is slowly repay this debt.

336
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:31,560
Which I mean, anytime you see an open pocket.

337
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:33,560
If you see his...

338
00:13:33,560 --> 00:13:34,560
He leaves his jorts out.

339
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:36,560
Whatever.

340
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:38,560
Jorts is not going to fit.

341
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:39,560
A lot of money.

342
00:13:39,560 --> 00:13:40,560
No, no, no.

343
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:41,560
Just like a jorts full.

344
00:13:41,560 --> 00:13:44,560
You slip one dollar in.

345
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:46,560
He'll never notice.

346
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:47,560
I'm like, huh.

347
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:48,560
A dollar.

348
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:49,560
Cool, I forgot.

349
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:51,560
And then with the 800,000th dollar,

350
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:53,560
which is what I'm assuming your deposit is,

351
00:13:53,560 --> 00:13:56,560
you have to present it like a pain in the feet.

352
00:13:56,560 --> 00:14:05,560
I think we're through here.

353
00:14:05,560 --> 00:14:08,560
That's a great plan to pay back your fee.

354
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:09,560
Your fee-fee.

355
00:14:09,560 --> 00:14:12,560
And it's also a great plan to slowly drive your roommate.

356
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:16,560
Yeah, if you want to gas light your roommate real bad,

357
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:19,560
do that and move the furniture one inch out of the way.

358
00:14:19,560 --> 00:14:21,560
Are we talking singles only?

359
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:22,560
Because that's like the whole apartment.

360
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:23,560
How about just quarters?

361
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:25,560
And you put them random places.

362
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:27,560
Like underneath his shoe, inside his shoe.

363
00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:29,560
Something where he's like, what the fuck?

364
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:33,560
What are these people doing?

365
00:14:33,560 --> 00:14:35,560
Can we talk about, we didn't address this,

366
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:36,560
but it's sort of germane.

367
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:38,560
It happened to us earlier this morning,

368
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:40,560
and it was so crazy that we didn't talk about it,

369
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:42,560
but we were getting on the elevator at our hotel.

370
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:43,560
There's a dude waiting on the elevator

371
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:46,560
who had dropped a $50 bill on the floor.

372
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:49,560
And like I pointed out, like, hey, you dropped $50.

373
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:51,560
That's the craziest thing ever, right?

374
00:14:51,560 --> 00:14:52,560
Like I wanted to chide him.

375
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:54,560
Like, that's $50.

376
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:57,560
What kind of person are you that you can drop $50?

377
00:14:57,560 --> 00:15:00,560
That was only the third time I've ever seen one of those

378
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:02,560
in my life.

379
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:06,560
I had one once, and I like duct taped it to my thigh.

380
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:09,560
He should have felt the weight change from his fall down.

381
00:15:09,560 --> 00:15:10,560
Oh, something's different.

382
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:11,560
Hold on.

383
00:15:11,560 --> 00:15:12,560
My boys.

384
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:15,560
I've been carrying like a plastic case for like baseball cards

385
00:15:15,560 --> 00:15:16,560
or something like that.

386
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:19,560
Also, if you drop a $50 bill, and someone is like,

387
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:20,560
hey, you dropped your $50 bill.

388
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:23,560
You have to give a piece of it at least.

389
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:24,560
Don't you expect a little bit like a...

390
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:27,560
I seriously thought, I thought John Keane was going to jump out

391
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:28,560
and be like, you did it right.

392
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:30,560
Good.

393
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:31,560
You picked the right answer.

394
00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:32,560
Why did you do that?

395
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:34,560
Explain your bravery.

396
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:40,560
Next step on Upworthy, you won't believe that this man...

397
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:45,560
One man dropped $50, you won't believe this other man's response.

398
00:15:45,560 --> 00:15:49,560
You won't believe this little boy's response.

399
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:51,560
You dropped your money.

400
00:15:51,560 --> 00:15:55,560
His only child doesn't swipe it.

401
00:15:55,560 --> 00:15:57,560
How about Yahoo?

402
00:15:57,560 --> 00:15:58,560
Yeah.

403
00:15:58,560 --> 00:15:59,560
Let's see.

404
00:15:59,560 --> 00:16:01,560
It got the response.

405
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:03,560
Positive reinforcement concept.

406
00:16:03,560 --> 00:16:05,560
This was sent in by Evan Weston.

407
00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:06,560
Thank you, Evan.

408
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:07,560
It's by Yahoo Answers.

409
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:09,560
This is the fucking worst website.

410
00:16:09,560 --> 00:16:12,560
It's been suspended.

411
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:14,560
But the question remains.

412
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:18,560
They asked posthumously,

413
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:28,560
how do I make the garbage man fall in love with me?

414
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:30,560
I'm in love with him.

415
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:34,560
I wait every Monday morning and the first Friday of every month.

416
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:37,560
That's kind of a fucked up trash collection schedule.

417
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:39,560
The first Friday is for the baby things.

418
00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:40,560
That's ball collect.

419
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:41,560
That makes sense.

420
00:16:41,560 --> 00:16:48,560
You've seen him use those big strong arms to pick up the garbage.

421
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:49,560
Like that.

422
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:50,560
Go on.

423
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:52,560
No matter how much garbage I put in there,

424
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:55,560
he still picks it up with ease.

425
00:16:55,560 --> 00:16:57,560
I had thrown away 20 bricks.

426
00:16:57,560 --> 00:17:00,560
Wasn't a problem.

427
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:03,560
That fool got it.

428
00:17:03,560 --> 00:17:05,560
How do I win his heart?

429
00:17:05,560 --> 00:17:08,560
You could start by not throwing away so much heavy shit.

430
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:09,560
Yeah.

431
00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:14,560
You could maybe stop making every day for this man a test of skill.

432
00:17:14,560 --> 00:17:16,560
Why don't we just bury all the trash in your yard

433
00:17:16,560 --> 00:17:18,560
and put an empty garbage can out there?

434
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:19,560
He doesn't pick it up.

435
00:17:19,560 --> 00:17:20,560
He picks it up.

436
00:17:20,560 --> 00:17:21,560
It's empty.

437
00:17:21,560 --> 00:17:22,560
He looks up.

438
00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:23,560
Is that you, Diane?

439
00:17:23,560 --> 00:17:24,560
You're like, that's me.

440
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:25,560
Happy birthday.

441
00:17:25,560 --> 00:17:27,560
Do you want to move in together?

442
00:17:27,560 --> 00:17:32,560
I have a buried pile of trash in my yard.

443
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:36,560
Could you throw away awesome shit?

444
00:17:36,560 --> 00:17:38,560
Not expensive shit that he's going to keep.

445
00:17:38,560 --> 00:17:39,560
Not a bribe.

446
00:17:39,560 --> 00:17:41,560
But something where he literally goes,

447
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:42,560
man, this person's awesome.

448
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:44,560
Yeah, you have to find out his facts.

449
00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:46,560
That does assume that your garbage man is coming to you going,

450
00:17:46,560 --> 00:17:48,560
well, hold on before I throw this away.

451
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:50,560
Let me build a character profile.

452
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:53,560
Let's make sure there's no awesome shit in here.

453
00:17:53,560 --> 00:17:55,560
Just count pasta.

454
00:17:55,560 --> 00:17:57,560
No, thank you.

455
00:17:57,560 --> 00:18:00,560
You threw away the entirety of X-Files on DVD.

456
00:18:00,560 --> 00:18:03,560
What a cool lady.

457
00:18:03,560 --> 00:18:05,560
With apparently money deferred.

458
00:18:05,560 --> 00:18:10,560
These four are newly found distains for the X-Files.

459
00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:12,560
A book called How to Seduce a Garbage Man

460
00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:14,560
and give him everything non-sexually.

461
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:15,560
Crazy.

462
00:18:15,560 --> 00:18:20,560
How have I not heard of this book?

463
00:18:20,560 --> 00:18:22,560
You could hide in the trash can.

464
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:27,560
You could.

465
00:18:27,560 --> 00:18:30,560
You hear the truck on by and poof.

466
00:18:30,560 --> 00:18:32,560
What's up?

467
00:18:32,560 --> 00:18:35,560
And then you're wearing some sexy lingerie.

468
00:18:35,560 --> 00:18:38,560
In the trash can.

469
00:18:38,560 --> 00:18:39,560
You know what's special for you?

470
00:18:39,560 --> 00:18:40,560
I'm garbage.

471
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:42,560
You got an Oscar of the Grouches.

472
00:18:42,560 --> 00:18:43,560
I'm garbage.

473
00:18:43,560 --> 00:18:46,560
I'm what you know.

474
00:18:46,560 --> 00:18:50,560
I want to be a part of the world.

475
00:18:50,560 --> 00:18:51,560
Look at this stuff.

476
00:18:51,560 --> 00:18:59,560
Isn't it neat?

477
00:18:59,560 --> 00:19:02,560
The trash can actor broke both of my...

478
00:19:02,560 --> 00:19:03,560
What's the word again?

479
00:19:03,560 --> 00:19:18,560
Legs.

480
00:19:18,560 --> 00:19:21,560
We're not going to top that joke for the rest of the day.

481
00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:22,560
You did warn me.

482
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:23,560
For like 30 minutes.

483
00:19:23,560 --> 00:19:25,560
I thought we agreed in the pre-creditor

484
00:19:25,560 --> 00:19:28,560
we were going to save the little mermaid garbage man.

485
00:19:28,560 --> 00:19:31,560
How about another question from a normie?

486
00:19:31,560 --> 00:19:32,560
Okay, let's see.

487
00:19:32,560 --> 00:19:33,560
I'm going to save that one.

488
00:19:33,560 --> 00:19:35,560
Let's go.

489
00:19:35,560 --> 00:19:36,560
Okay.

490
00:19:36,560 --> 00:19:39,560
This may be my favorite question we've ever received.

491
00:19:39,560 --> 00:19:40,560
Okay.

492
00:19:40,560 --> 00:19:41,560
Sorry, everybody else here...

493
00:19:41,560 --> 00:19:44,560
All the questions is dump.

494
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:47,560
When ordering a pizza online the other day,

495
00:19:47,560 --> 00:19:50,560
I accidentally typed in the wrong apartment number.

496
00:19:50,560 --> 00:19:53,560
By the time I noticed my mistake and called the pizza place,

497
00:19:53,560 --> 00:19:54,560
it was too late.

498
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:55,560
The people...

499
00:19:55,560 --> 00:19:56,560
Son of a bitch.

500
00:19:56,560 --> 00:19:59,560
The people in the wrong apartment took the free pizza

501
00:19:59,560 --> 00:20:02,560
rather than admitting it wasn't theirs.

502
00:20:02,560 --> 00:20:07,560
I know where these pizza thieves live.

503
00:20:07,560 --> 00:20:08,560
What are my options?

504
00:20:08,560 --> 00:20:11,560
And that's from Trustless in California.

505
00:20:11,560 --> 00:20:12,560
Big thanks first off to Justin

506
00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:15,560
for grabbing the crunchiest food on the table.

507
00:20:15,560 --> 00:20:18,560
You could have gone banana and nobody would have known

508
00:20:18,560 --> 00:20:20,560
and you went with kettle cooked potato chips.

509
00:20:20,560 --> 00:20:21,560
What the fuck are these?

510
00:20:21,560 --> 00:20:22,560
What is a chocoroon?

511
00:20:22,560 --> 00:20:24,560
What is a chocoroon?

512
00:20:24,560 --> 00:20:25,560
Wait a minute.

513
00:20:25,560 --> 00:20:26,560
Time out on this question.

514
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:29,560
What is a chocoroon?

515
00:20:29,560 --> 00:20:31,560
Sweet and crispy.

516
00:20:31,560 --> 00:20:32,560
Hold on a second.

517
00:20:32,560 --> 00:20:36,560
We need to take a quick break.

518
00:20:36,560 --> 00:20:39,560
Welcome to the Mavro Brothers Eat Snacks.

519
00:20:39,560 --> 00:20:41,560
Can we take chocoroons to the Money Zone?

520
00:20:41,560 --> 00:20:43,560
Yeah, let's go to the Money Zone.

521
00:20:43,560 --> 00:20:45,560
Wait, you're going to wait and eat them together?

522
00:20:45,560 --> 00:20:46,560
No.

523
00:20:46,560 --> 00:20:48,560
Oh, okay.

524
00:20:48,560 --> 00:20:51,560
Chocoroons wait for no man.

525
00:20:51,560 --> 00:20:52,560
Pretty good.

526
00:20:52,560 --> 00:20:55,560
It's way better than regular mushrooms.

527
00:20:55,560 --> 00:20:58,560
Regular mushrooms are not chocolatey or crispy.

528
00:20:58,560 --> 00:20:59,560
Okay, great.

529
00:20:59,560 --> 00:21:02,560
But I'm at the store and this has been the Money Zone.

530
00:21:02,560 --> 00:21:04,560
So back to chocoroons.

531
00:21:04,560 --> 00:21:06,560
So someone stole this piece of pizza.

532
00:21:06,560 --> 00:21:11,560
Guys, we literally can't snack the entire show.

533
00:21:11,560 --> 00:21:15,560
Yeah, that's going to keep you.

534
00:21:15,560 --> 00:21:17,560
I'm 48 pounds overweight.

535
00:21:17,560 --> 00:21:21,560
This is what's been stopping me the entire time.

536
00:21:21,560 --> 00:21:24,560
Travis said I'm going to hit you with a one-two punch.

537
00:21:24,560 --> 00:21:28,560
If only someone had moved the snacks one inch out of my reach.

538
00:21:28,560 --> 00:21:32,560
Travis will push it out of reach and I'll do cookie points.

539
00:21:32,560 --> 00:21:35,560
And then that will be Bradley Cooper.

540
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:37,560
Griffin is trying to suggest that I lost cookie points.

541
00:21:37,560 --> 00:21:39,560
If you don't know, cookie points is official currency.

542
00:21:39,560 --> 00:21:41,560
I earn for eating salad or vegetables.

543
00:21:41,560 --> 00:21:44,560
That you can exchange like arcade tickets.

544
00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:46,560
Or cookies.

545
00:21:46,560 --> 00:21:50,560
Not cookies he gives me, but the right ability to eat cookies.

546
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:56,560
And Griffin tried to tell me today that just because I got a muffin.

547
00:21:56,560 --> 00:21:58,560
Which is a tall cookie.

548
00:21:58,560 --> 00:22:01,560
Well, he said a muffin is a tall cookie.

549
00:22:01,560 --> 00:22:04,560
A chocolate chip muffin that you try to get.

550
00:22:04,560 --> 00:22:09,560
Yeah, it's like taking a cookie and making it grow.

551
00:22:09,560 --> 00:22:12,560
We've been off topic for 15 minutes.

552
00:22:12,560 --> 00:22:15,560
All right, pizza thief.

553
00:22:15,560 --> 00:22:17,560
Pizza thief, pizza thief.

554
00:22:17,560 --> 00:22:19,560
Should you confront the person?

555
00:22:19,560 --> 00:22:24,560
Do you know how many pizzas you'd have to give me to confront anybody about anything?

556
00:22:24,560 --> 00:22:27,560
I saw a story on Dayline about people who were using Find My Phone.

557
00:22:27,560 --> 00:22:29,560
The app on your phone.

558
00:22:29,560 --> 00:22:32,560
That you can find your phone with it.

559
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:34,560
And people will get their shit stole.

560
00:22:34,560 --> 00:22:36,560
And then will find their phone.

561
00:22:36,560 --> 00:22:38,560
And by which I mean the person who stole their phone.

562
00:22:38,560 --> 00:22:41,560
Who would then kill them.

563
00:22:41,560 --> 00:22:42,560
Sometimes.

564
00:22:42,560 --> 00:22:44,560
Hold on, hold on, hold on.

565
00:22:44,560 --> 00:22:48,560
The person finding their phone kills the person who took their phone.

566
00:22:48,560 --> 00:22:49,560
Or the person?

567
00:22:49,560 --> 00:22:50,560
No.

568
00:22:50,560 --> 00:22:53,560
What he's saying is like someone steals my shit.

569
00:22:53,560 --> 00:22:56,560
All of a sudden I'm going to deputize myself.

570
00:22:56,560 --> 00:22:59,560
Now I'm the equalizer.

571
00:22:59,560 --> 00:23:04,560
I'm going to go track down that fool and settle the score citizens arrest style.

572
00:23:04,560 --> 00:23:06,560
Pardon me, sir.

573
00:23:06,560 --> 00:23:08,560
You wronged me earlier.

574
00:23:08,560 --> 00:23:10,560
I demand satisfaction.

575
00:23:10,560 --> 00:23:13,560
Please lie down on the ground until the authorities are...

576
00:23:13,560 --> 00:23:15,560
Now what is that you have there?

577
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:17,560
Is that a gun?

578
00:23:17,560 --> 00:23:19,560
Interesting.

579
00:23:19,560 --> 00:23:23,560
But you're implying that we would be afraid of confronting this pizza thief as the pizza thief.

580
00:23:23,560 --> 00:23:26,560
Rather than going to prison for stealing your pizza would kill you.

581
00:23:26,560 --> 00:23:31,560
A pizza costs $5 at Little Caesars.

582
00:23:31,560 --> 00:23:38,560
Do you think a person ordered a $5 hot and ready to be brought to their home?

583
00:23:38,560 --> 00:23:40,560
What kind of life are you living?

584
00:23:40,560 --> 00:23:46,560
Listen, I don't want nothing fancy, but I also do need it raw.

585
00:23:46,560 --> 00:23:48,560
I'm a humble man.

586
00:23:48,560 --> 00:23:51,560
I'm saying a phone costs way more than a hot and ready.

587
00:23:51,560 --> 00:23:53,560
So why would you confront a person for pizza?

588
00:23:53,560 --> 00:23:55,560
Just get another pizza.

589
00:23:55,560 --> 00:23:57,560
Just get another pizza.

590
00:23:57,560 --> 00:24:01,560
How about you just start ordering pizzas for that apartment with a note saying,

591
00:24:01,560 --> 00:24:04,560
I think you need this more than I do.

592
00:24:04,560 --> 00:24:09,560
And just really shame them about like clearly you're on some hard time.

593
00:24:09,560 --> 00:24:11,560
The old guilt pizza.

594
00:24:11,560 --> 00:24:14,560
Do you know what the best type of pizza on earth is?

595
00:24:14,560 --> 00:24:16,560
Pepperoni's in shame.

596
00:24:16,560 --> 00:24:18,560
No.

597
00:24:18,560 --> 00:24:20,560
It's Fritza, which is free pizza.

598
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:24,560
And you need to just appreciate the fact that you are giving these people a wonderful and beautiful pizza.

599
00:24:24,560 --> 00:24:26,560
That you can't give yourself.

600
00:24:26,560 --> 00:24:28,560
That's a great point.

601
00:24:28,560 --> 00:24:32,560
You could pay for a pizza with money that someone else gave you.

602
00:24:32,560 --> 00:24:34,560
It would never be as delicious.

603
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:37,560
Even if you're not taking a net loss is what I'm saying.

604
00:24:37,560 --> 00:24:39,560
Pay it forward and pay it forward the movie.

605
00:24:39,560 --> 00:24:43,560
Which we reference a lot, but it's a fucking incredible movie.

606
00:24:43,560 --> 00:24:45,560
It's a movie we will see at some point.

607
00:24:45,560 --> 00:24:47,560
I promise you we'll actually watch it.

608
00:24:47,560 --> 00:24:49,560
I saw it in theaters.

609
00:24:49,560 --> 00:24:52,560
Caleb Joel Osment buys three people, three pizzas.

610
00:24:52,560 --> 00:24:55,560
And then it gets stabbed in the stomach and dies.

611
00:24:57,560 --> 00:24:59,560
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

612
00:24:59,560 --> 00:25:01,560
No, really, yeah.

613
00:25:01,560 --> 00:25:03,560
Does the second part actually happen?

614
00:25:03,560 --> 00:25:05,560
The pizza part?

615
00:25:05,560 --> 00:25:07,560
Why would that be a movie?

616
00:25:07,560 --> 00:25:09,560
They just stab a little kid?

617
00:25:09,560 --> 00:25:11,560
Yep.

618
00:25:11,560 --> 00:25:13,560
Sorry, it was other little kids.

619
00:25:13,560 --> 00:25:15,560
It wasn't like an adult stabbing a little kid.

620
00:25:15,560 --> 00:25:17,560
But yeah, he definitely gets stabbed in the stomach.

621
00:25:17,560 --> 00:25:19,560
Why?

622
00:25:19,560 --> 00:25:21,560
He was paying it forward and shit.

623
00:25:21,560 --> 00:25:23,560
Listen, some people don't want that.

624
00:25:23,560 --> 00:25:25,560
Some people are like, pay it backward.

625
00:25:27,560 --> 00:25:29,560
How about you pay off the people that did shit for you?

626
00:25:29,560 --> 00:25:31,560
Yeah.

627
00:25:31,560 --> 00:25:33,560
You owe them money?

628
00:25:33,560 --> 00:25:37,560
He tried to say, oh my god, are we going to fucking go over the entire thought of pizza?

629
00:25:37,560 --> 00:25:39,560
Everybody talk amongst yourselves.

630
00:25:39,560 --> 00:25:41,560
I don't know if I got bored for Justin Roeper.

631
00:25:41,560 --> 00:25:43,560
So here's what happened.

632
00:25:43,560 --> 00:25:47,560
He was trying to stop these bullies from picking on his friend.

633
00:25:47,560 --> 00:25:49,560
And it was the one he put off until the end.

634
00:25:49,560 --> 00:25:51,560
So he rode his bike and said, I'm going to get you.

635
00:25:51,560 --> 00:25:55,560
But then he had a knife and they stabbed him in the stomach.

636
00:25:55,560 --> 00:25:57,560
And Kevin Spacey was there.

637
00:25:57,560 --> 00:25:59,560
He watched the whole thing and didn't do any.

638
00:25:59,560 --> 00:26:01,560
Cool job, K-Pax.

639
00:26:03,560 --> 00:26:07,560
I don't know how you return from that in this movie.

640
00:26:07,560 --> 00:26:09,560
It's the end of the movie, Justin.

641
00:26:09,560 --> 00:26:11,560
Fuck me.

642
00:26:13,560 --> 00:26:15,560
It's not like they end it.

643
00:26:15,560 --> 00:26:17,560
He gets stabbed and they're like, well, that sucks, Bailey.

644
00:26:17,560 --> 00:26:23,560
What happened is, as Haley was dying, he grabbed Kevin Spacey's shirt and said, pay it forward.

645
00:26:23,560 --> 00:26:25,560
And then Kevin Spacey stabbed the three bullies.

646
00:26:25,560 --> 00:26:27,560
He went, one, two, three, done.

647
00:26:31,560 --> 00:26:33,560
And now Haley, you pay it.

648
00:26:33,560 --> 00:26:35,560
Ah, fuck.

649
00:26:35,560 --> 00:26:37,560
I should have taken you to the hospital.

650
00:26:37,560 --> 00:26:39,560
I'm the worst dad ever.

651
00:26:39,560 --> 00:26:41,560
I want to say something to you.

652
00:26:41,560 --> 00:26:43,560
I have six podcasts to record today.

653
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:47,560
I'm legitimately bummed out about this movie.

654
00:26:47,560 --> 00:26:51,560
I saw it in theaters when I was like 11.

655
00:26:51,560 --> 00:26:53,560
That explains a lot.

656
00:26:53,560 --> 00:26:55,560
Can we get like another, a whole other...

657
00:26:55,560 --> 00:26:57,560
Whole other subject.

658
00:26:57,560 --> 00:26:59,560
Is there another...

659
00:26:59,560 --> 00:27:01,560
Who wants to...

660
00:27:01,560 --> 00:27:05,560
Have the first person say, I'm going to pay this forward.

661
00:27:05,560 --> 00:27:07,560
I'm going to not tell anybody to watch this.

662
00:27:07,560 --> 00:27:09,560
I'm going to tell nobody this is in the theater.

663
00:27:09,560 --> 00:27:11,560
I'll pay it forward.

664
00:27:11,560 --> 00:27:13,560
He was very antagonistic.

665
00:27:13,560 --> 00:27:15,560
It was one of those things where he gets stabbed and you're like, oh, it's a kid.

666
00:27:15,560 --> 00:27:17,560
I get it.

667
00:27:17,560 --> 00:27:19,560
Fucking great.

668
00:27:19,560 --> 00:27:21,560
This is the Haley Joel thing that starts the pay it forward movement, right?

669
00:27:21,560 --> 00:27:23,560
Am I missing something about that?

670
00:27:23,560 --> 00:27:25,560
Pay it forward movement.

671
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:27,560
Oh, we have to move on.

672
00:27:27,560 --> 00:27:29,560
We have to move it forward.

673
00:27:29,560 --> 00:27:35,560
Hey everybody, we want to take a quick break from the live action to provide you with this important...

674
00:27:35,560 --> 00:27:37,560
It's not live though, is it?

675
00:27:37,560 --> 00:27:39,560
Well, I mean, it was live when we made it.

676
00:27:39,560 --> 00:27:41,560
Now it's not live anymore.

677
00:27:41,560 --> 00:27:43,560
Now it's dead as fuck.

678
00:27:43,560 --> 00:27:49,560
It's dead as disco, Griffin, but we still wanted to take a moment for the Money Zone to tell you about Simple.

679
00:27:49,560 --> 00:27:51,560
Simple is the way banking should be.

680
00:27:51,560 --> 00:27:55,560
Take everything you know about banking and flush it down the fucking toilet.

681
00:27:55,560 --> 00:27:59,560
Like a bill info turd.

682
00:27:59,560 --> 00:28:01,560
Simple doesn't even use money.

683
00:28:01,560 --> 00:28:03,560
What does it use?

684
00:28:03,560 --> 00:28:05,560
Cookie points?

685
00:28:05,560 --> 00:28:07,560
It uses cookie points.

686
00:28:07,560 --> 00:28:09,560
It's the internet's premier cookie point transaction facility.

687
00:28:09,560 --> 00:28:11,560
Well, they don't actually use money for some stuff.

688
00:28:11,560 --> 00:28:13,560
You don't have to have a minimum balance.

689
00:28:13,560 --> 00:28:15,560
There's no monthly fee.

690
00:28:15,560 --> 00:28:17,560
There's no overdraft charges.

691
00:28:17,560 --> 00:28:23,560
And you can use over 55,000 ATMs around the globe for free.

692
00:28:23,560 --> 00:28:25,560
You can deposit your checks also by taking a picture of them.

693
00:28:25,560 --> 00:28:27,560
I like that.

694
00:28:27,560 --> 00:28:29,560
But I'm bad with money.

695
00:28:29,560 --> 00:28:33,560
Can Simple yell at me when I try to spend too much money on dumb shit?

696
00:28:33,560 --> 00:28:35,560
Hey, dummy.

697
00:28:35,560 --> 00:28:37,560
I want to help you reach your goals.

698
00:28:37,560 --> 00:28:39,560
It's like tough love.

699
00:28:39,560 --> 00:28:41,560
You tell how much you want to save and it'll tell you how much you can spend on fun shit.

700
00:28:41,560 --> 00:28:43,560
And you'll still have money to pay for the bills.

701
00:28:43,560 --> 00:28:45,560
And save your money.

702
00:28:45,560 --> 00:28:49,560
Set one up for your max fun contribution, it says here.

703
00:28:49,560 --> 00:28:51,560
So you can just put that aside.

704
00:28:51,560 --> 00:28:53,560
And maybe set that number to 1,000.

705
00:28:53,560 --> 00:28:55,560
Maybe jack that up because you're so Simple rich.

706
00:28:55,560 --> 00:28:57,560
Because you did Simple good.

707
00:28:57,560 --> 00:28:59,560
You can pay your bills super fast.

708
00:28:59,560 --> 00:29:03,560
Is this a fake one that's going to take all the money that I have from me?

709
00:29:03,560 --> 00:29:05,560
I know why you would think that.

710
00:29:05,560 --> 00:29:07,560
But you're wrong.

711
00:29:07,560 --> 00:29:09,560
They're an actual real ass company.

712
00:29:09,560 --> 00:29:11,560
And your account's FDIC insured.

713
00:29:11,560 --> 00:29:13,560
And they don't sell your data.

714
00:29:13,560 --> 00:29:15,560
And it's all very good.

715
00:29:15,560 --> 00:29:19,560
Now, the Simple.com is popping off so hard that they have like a wait list to get in it.

716
00:29:19,560 --> 00:29:21,560
To get onto it.

717
00:29:21,560 --> 00:29:23,560
But you can skip that.

718
00:29:23,560 --> 00:29:25,560
Sorry, we're full.

719
00:29:25,560 --> 00:29:27,560
We only got room for chicks.

720
00:29:27,560 --> 00:29:29,560
I know the McElroy brothers.

721
00:29:29,560 --> 00:29:31,560
So I can get in for free.

722
00:29:31,560 --> 00:29:33,560
Oh, come on in then.

723
00:29:33,560 --> 00:29:35,560
Simple.com slash my brother.

724
00:29:35,560 --> 00:29:37,560
Let me do my bit.

725
00:29:37,560 --> 00:29:39,560
Let me do my bouncer bit.

726
00:29:39,560 --> 00:29:41,560
Okay, finish the bouncer bit.

727
00:29:41,560 --> 00:29:43,560
I thought it was done.

728
00:29:43,560 --> 00:29:45,560
Come on in then.

729
00:29:45,560 --> 00:29:47,560
Simple.com slash my brother.

730
00:29:47,560 --> 00:29:49,560
Okay, let's talk about Squarespace.

731
00:29:49,560 --> 00:29:53,560
Yes, two different people listened to this and said, yeah, let's give them money to talk about us.

732
00:29:53,560 --> 00:29:59,560
Squarespace is the all-in-one platform that makes it fast and easy to create your own professional website or online portfolio.

733
00:29:59,560 --> 00:30:01,560
Listen, you've heard us talk about Squarespace a lot.

734
00:30:01,560 --> 00:30:03,560
They've been chopping and screwing it.

735
00:30:03,560 --> 00:30:05,560
Improving it.

736
00:30:05,560 --> 00:30:07,560
They got new designs, new features, even better support.

737
00:30:07,560 --> 00:30:11,560
They have beautiful designs for you to start with if you're a dummy and don't know how to website.

738
00:30:11,560 --> 00:30:16,560
If you're not a dummy and you do know how to website, you can take those designs and chop and screw them even more.

739
00:30:16,560 --> 00:30:21,560
To create a bespoke website of your own bespoking.

740
00:30:21,560 --> 00:30:23,560
This sounds amazing, Griffin.

741
00:30:23,560 --> 00:30:25,560
It is fucking amazing.

742
00:30:25,560 --> 00:30:27,560
It's expensive though, right?

743
00:30:27,560 --> 00:30:29,560
It's not expensive.

744
00:30:29,560 --> 00:30:31,560
It costs dollars a month.

745
00:30:31,560 --> 00:30:33,560
Eight dollars a month.

746
00:30:33,560 --> 00:30:36,560
And you get a free domain name if you sign up for a year with that.

747
00:30:36,560 --> 00:30:38,560
So do it.

748
00:30:38,560 --> 00:30:40,560
They have responsive design.

749
00:30:40,560 --> 00:30:42,560
It'll work on all your products.

750
00:30:42,560 --> 00:30:44,560

00:30:44,560 --> 00:30:46,560

753

Check it out, you dummy.

758
00:30:58,560 --> 00:31:00,560
I got a personal message here.

759
00:31:00,560 --> 00:31:02,560
To Lisa from Don.

760
00:31:02,560 --> 00:31:06,560
Don says May 26th is our third or fourth wedding anniversary.

761
00:31:06,560 --> 00:31:08,560
Pretty close.

762
00:31:08,560 --> 00:31:10,560
Pretty good job.

763
00:31:10,560 --> 00:31:12,560
And May 31st is Lisa's 28th birthday.

764
00:31:12,560 --> 00:31:18,560
Happy birthday and happy anniversary from your sweet, sweet husband.

765
00:31:18,560 --> 00:31:20,560
Your pup, Jonas.

766
00:31:20,560 --> 00:31:22,560
Your kitty, Blueberry.

767
00:31:22,560 --> 00:31:24,560
And your favorite trio of podcasting brothers.

768
00:31:24,560 --> 00:31:28,560
Travis, a sad lib would really make her day.

769
00:31:28,560 --> 00:31:30,560
Sorry, Travis is dead.

770
00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:32,560
That's why he's not here.

771
00:31:32,560 --> 00:31:34,560
He's not dead. Don't say that.

772
00:31:34,560 --> 00:31:36,560
Travis will never die.

773
00:31:36,560 --> 00:31:38,560
He's got the secret diet that keeps you alive forever.

774
00:31:38,560 --> 00:31:40,560
Happy birthday, Lisa.

775
00:31:40,560 --> 00:31:42,560
Sorry we couldn't Travis you.

776
00:31:42,560 --> 00:31:44,560
But I don't know where that fool is.

777
00:31:44,560 --> 00:31:46,560
Have you heard from him today?

778
00:31:46,560 --> 00:31:48,560
Nah.

779
00:31:48,560 --> 00:31:50,560
I got a message to Henry and Allie from...

780
00:31:50,560 --> 00:31:52,560
Should have read this ahead of time.

781
00:31:52,560 --> 00:31:54,560
Tilda Swinton's pussy and associates.

782
00:31:54,560 --> 00:31:56,560
Is that a callback?

783
00:31:56,560 --> 00:31:58,560
I hope we haven't talked about that.

784
00:31:58,560 --> 00:32:00,560
Salutations.

785
00:32:00,560 --> 00:32:02,560
Yael's wedding was the blast of blast.

786
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:04,560
You two are simply the best two people that we know.

787
00:32:04,560 --> 00:32:06,560
And we are so happy for you.

788
00:32:06,560 --> 00:32:08,560
Now go and get to work on growing your cat harem.

789
00:32:08,560 --> 00:32:10,560
Because buddy told us you wanted friends.

790
00:32:10,560 --> 00:32:12,560
Here's hoping the goofball reading this

791
00:32:12,560 --> 00:32:14,560
pronounce your names goofily.

792
00:32:14,560 --> 00:32:16,560
It's Henry and Allie.

793
00:32:16,560 --> 00:32:18,560
How we can fuck up Henry and Allie.

794
00:32:18,560 --> 00:32:20,560
I fucked up the grammar of that sentence.

795
00:32:20,560 --> 00:32:22,560
I said how we can fuck up.

796
00:32:22,560 --> 00:32:24,560
So even I fucked that up I can't fuck up that name.

797
00:32:24,560 --> 00:32:26,560
Henry.

798
00:32:26,560 --> 00:32:28,560
Sorry. Henry.

799
00:32:28,560 --> 00:32:30,560
Anyway guys, good job.

800
00:32:30,560 --> 00:32:32,560
Good job getting married.

801
00:32:32,560 --> 00:32:34,560
Big thanks to everybody who came out to the live shows too.

802
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:36,560
We're going to spread them out probably a little bit.

803
00:32:36,560 --> 00:32:38,560
Is the first one.

804
00:32:38,560 --> 00:32:40,560
They all went super well.

805
00:32:40,560 --> 00:32:42,560
I feel like we met everybody at all three shows.

806
00:32:42,560 --> 00:32:44,560
And you were all super fucking cool.

807
00:32:44,560 --> 00:32:46,560
We'll have to do it again real soon.

808
00:32:46,560 --> 00:32:48,560
Because I'm turning the corner on New York City.

809
00:32:48,560 --> 00:32:50,560
I actually think it's a nice place to be.

810
00:32:50,560 --> 00:32:52,560
As opposed to just like a trap that you fly into

811
00:32:52,560 --> 00:32:54,560
and then you can't fly out of.

812
00:32:54,560 --> 00:32:56,560
The Bermuda Triangle.

813
00:32:56,560 --> 00:32:58,560
It's the Bermuda Triangle, yes.

814
00:32:58,560 --> 00:33:00,560
Of cities. But actually it's pretty tight.

815
00:33:00,560 --> 00:33:02,560
They got real good Korean food there.

816
00:33:02,560 --> 00:33:04,560
Oh boy.

817
00:33:04,560 --> 00:33:06,560
That's a story for another time.

818
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:08,560
Anyway, thanks for listening.

819
00:33:08,560 --> 00:33:10,560
We'll get back to the live show now.

820
00:33:10,560 --> 00:33:12,560
This Yahoo answer was...

821
00:33:12,560 --> 00:33:14,560
Oh, I'm going to fuck this name right up.

822
00:33:14,560 --> 00:33:16,560
You want to try this one?

823
00:33:16,560 --> 00:33:18,560
You never are in this position of having to try it.

824
00:33:18,560 --> 00:33:20,560
How do I know?

825
00:33:20,560 --> 00:33:22,560
Ivica Fulnovic.

826
00:33:22,560 --> 00:33:24,560
Better than nothing.

827
00:33:24,560 --> 00:33:26,560
It's asked by Yahoo answers user

828
00:33:26,560 --> 00:33:28,560
Grand Duchess Anast.

829
00:33:28,560 --> 00:33:30,560
Who asked...

830
00:33:30,560 --> 00:33:32,560
Have you ever heard of the

831
00:33:32,560 --> 00:33:34,560
McDizzle at McDonald's?

832
00:33:36,560 --> 00:33:38,560
I have heard of it and only one of my friends

833
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:40,560
have heard of it. Do you know?

834
00:33:42,560 --> 00:33:46,560
I love the conversational Yahoo is the best.

835
00:33:46,560 --> 00:33:48,560
Hey, did you guys know about this?

836
00:33:48,560 --> 00:33:50,560
Yeah, that's just typed on screen.

837
00:33:50,560 --> 00:33:52,560
This...

838
00:33:52,560 --> 00:33:54,560
This fucking Yahoo Knights mystery

839
00:33:54,560 --> 00:33:56,560
sent me down such

840
00:33:56,560 --> 00:33:58,560
a rabbit hole.

841
00:33:58,560 --> 00:34:00,560
Because there are

842
00:34:00,560 --> 00:34:02,560
secret orders online

843
00:34:02,560 --> 00:34:04,560
who assure you

844
00:34:04,560 --> 00:34:06,560
that there exists a McDonald's secret menu.

845
00:34:06,560 --> 00:34:08,560
Much like In-N-Out.

846
00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:10,560
Much like Peteri's and so many

847
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:12,560
other chain fast food restaurants.

848
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:14,560
Is the argument, is the conceit

849
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:16,560
here that like, among the

850
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:18,560
absolute baseline

851
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:20,560
level training that a McDonald's employee receives

852
00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:22,560
there is another level that

853
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:24,560
they have to come in on Saturday

854
00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:26,560
to learn the secret menu know-it-all?

855
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:28,560
We're not talking about if you can't get a pasta

856
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:30,560
we're talking about taking their garbage food

857
00:34:30,560 --> 00:34:32,560
and making it into other garbage.

858
00:34:36,560 --> 00:34:38,560
Let's start with for instance...

859
00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:40,560
Make it worse.

860
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:46,560
Was that Tim Gunn

861
00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:48,560
or Jean-Luc Picard?

862
00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:54,560
I couldn't tell you.

863
00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:56,560
I couldn't tell you.

864
00:34:56,560 --> 00:34:58,560
We'll start with the poor man's Big Mac.

865
00:34:58,560 --> 00:35:00,560
And this is a secret menu...

866
00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:02,560
What's the rich man's Big Mac?

867
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:06,560
Burn.

868
00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:08,560
Take that, Ollie.

869
00:35:10,560 --> 00:35:12,560
Oh man.

870
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:14,560
The beginning sentence of that

871
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:16,560
is my favorite.

872
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:18,560
Who doesn't love Big Mac?

873
00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:20,560
A lot of people actually...

874
00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:22,560
But not everyone loves its price.

875
00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:24,560
Yeah. How much?

876
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:26,560
35 cents.

877
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:28,560
So if you want to get something

878
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:30,560
close to Big Mac without paying the full price

879
00:35:30,560 --> 00:35:32,560
what you can do is order a McDouble

880
00:35:32,560 --> 00:35:34,560
but remove the ketchup and pickles.

881
00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:36,560
Instead, ask for extra onions, lettuce

882
00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:38,560
and a Big Mac sauce.

883
00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:40,560
It tastes almost the same because of the absence

884
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:42,560
of the sesame seed buns and a slice of cheese.

885
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:44,560
You can get

886
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:46,560
at least three of these secret

887
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:48,560
secret budget Big Mac

888
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:50,560
for the price of a Big Mac.

889
00:35:50,560 --> 00:35:52,560
I want you all to picture the face

890
00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:54,560
of the McDonald's employee when you go

891
00:35:54,560 --> 00:35:56,560
I want a McDonald's but hold on.

892
00:35:56,560 --> 00:35:58,560
Before you start making a McDouble.

893
00:35:58,560 --> 00:36:00,560
I want a McDouble.

894
00:36:00,560 --> 00:36:02,560
But hold on.

895
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:04,560
Here's the thing. I'm going to chop it and screw it up.

896
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:06,560
I'm talking after onions.

897
00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:08,560
I'm just going to hand you

898
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:10,560
this pre-made McDouble.

899
00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:12,560
You take this and you leave.

900
00:36:12,560 --> 00:36:14,560
And I go back.

901
00:36:14,560 --> 00:36:16,560
They may not

902
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:18,560
be on to the game until

903
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:20,560
you say and um

904
00:36:20,560 --> 00:36:22,560
Big Mac with sauce.

905
00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:24,560
It's like um

906
00:36:24,560 --> 00:36:26,560
an extra one of those

907
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:28,560
and give me those and

908
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:30,560
Big Mac sauce.

909
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:32,560
Maybe you just have

910
00:36:32,560 --> 00:36:34,560
I mean if you have them.

911
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:36,560
I heard it's just Dallas, Mildred and Jackson.

912
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:38,560
How about

913
00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:40,560
oh this is fucking the worst.

914
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:42,560
This one can't be

915
00:36:42,560 --> 00:36:44,560
This one can't be something that you just say.

916
00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:46,560
It has to be

917
00:36:46,560 --> 00:36:48,560
you're a piece of shit.

918
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:50,560
And then you fucking

919
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:52,560
sloppy handed Guy Fieri

920
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:54,560
at the sad McDonald's table

921
00:36:54,560 --> 00:36:56,560
like

922
00:36:56,560 --> 00:36:58,560
This is the

923
00:36:58,560 --> 00:37:00,560
McBland sea and air burger.

924
00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:06,560
Captain Planet may have been a thing in the 90s

925
00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:08,560
but this burger is like the powers

926
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:10,560
of Captain Planet.

927
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:12,560
This burger is like the powers of

928
00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:14,560
Captain Planet combined.

929
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:18,560
I don't think diarrhea

930
00:37:18,560 --> 00:37:20,560
was one of the elements of a

931
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:24,560
Imagine eating a hamburger

932
00:37:24,560 --> 00:37:26,560
and the chicken, sure.

933
00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:28,560
And the filet of fish, sure. All in once.

934
00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:30,560
Fuck you.

935
00:37:30,560 --> 00:37:32,560
So yeah.

936
00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:34,560
Epic burger is epic. There's a picture.

937
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:36,560
It's the

938
00:37:36,560 --> 00:37:38,560
Oh God.

939
00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:40,560
Anyone like to come up and see the picture?

940
00:37:40,560 --> 00:37:42,560
No.

941
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:44,560
Jesus Christ.

942
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:46,560
Let's talk about the McCrape recipe.

943
00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:48,560
McDonald's has crepes?

944
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:50,560
Kind of.

945
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:52,560
I'm not sure you're pronouncing

946
00:37:52,560 --> 00:37:54,560
McCrape properly.

947
00:37:56,560 --> 00:37:58,560
And then we went for some French breakfast.

948
00:37:58,560 --> 00:38:00,560
Why did you go to McDonald's then?

949
00:38:02,560 --> 00:38:04,560
I went to McDonald's but I want something

950
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:06,560
with an international flair.

951
00:38:06,560 --> 00:38:08,560
I considered both a breakfast and a dessert.

952
00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:12,560
And a thing, apparently. That exists.

953
00:38:12,560 --> 00:38:14,560
This secret menu item will allow you

954
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:16,560
to eat crepe McDonald's style.

955
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:18,560
Just like you've always wanted to.

956
00:38:20,560 --> 00:38:22,560
You guys have done such a great job

957
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:24,560
with chicken and hamburgers.

958
00:38:24,560 --> 00:38:26,560
What I was wondering is...

959
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:28,560
Maybe a crepe?

960
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:30,560
Just or Mr. McDonald's hot cakes

961
00:38:30,560 --> 00:38:32,560
because they're extremely delicious.

962
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:34,560
I didn't make that up. That's on here.

963
00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:36,560
I'm not sharing the treats.

964
00:38:36,560 --> 00:38:38,560
I'm writing it to you right now.

965
00:38:38,560 --> 00:38:40,560
That's the person.

966
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:42,560
Then buy a yogurt parfait.

967
00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:44,560
Simply put the yogurt inside the pancake

968
00:38:44,560 --> 00:38:46,560
and wrap it up like a crepe.

969
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:48,560
Top the pancake with fruit, granola,

970
00:38:48,560 --> 00:38:50,560
and optional syrup.

971
00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:52,560
That's it. You have your own homemade

972
00:38:52,560 --> 00:38:54,560
slightly-eaten McCrape.

973
00:38:54,560 --> 00:38:56,560
You laugh but right now there's a guy

974
00:38:56,560 --> 00:38:58,560
at Taco Bell like...

975
00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:02,560
Here's the thing.

976
00:39:02,560 --> 00:39:04,560
That's not a crepe.

977
00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:06,560
That makes it a fucking pancake with shit inside.

978
00:39:06,560 --> 00:39:08,560
That's a sloppy boy.

979
00:39:08,560 --> 00:39:10,560
That does not change it from a pancake to a crepe.

980
00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:12,560
It's just like a crepe.

981
00:39:12,560 --> 00:39:14,560
No.

982
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:16,560
It looks like dump.

983
00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:20,560
It really does look like puke.

984
00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:22,560
In a pancake.

985
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:24,560
Welcome to our show.

986
00:39:24,560 --> 00:39:26,560
We talk about pictures you can't see.

987
00:39:26,560 --> 00:39:28,560
No, we're painting work pictures.

988
00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:30,560
It looks like if you jammed

989
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:32,560
oats and a hand grenade

990
00:39:32,560 --> 00:39:34,560
inside a pajama.

991
00:39:34,560 --> 00:39:36,560
It's what it looks like.

992
00:39:36,560 --> 00:39:38,560
How's that?

993
00:39:38,560 --> 00:39:40,560
But now you know what it is.

994
00:39:40,560 --> 00:39:42,560
We can go on.

995
00:39:42,560 --> 00:39:44,560
There's a Mc10-35.

996
00:39:44,560 --> 00:39:46,560
Half breakfast, half lunch items.

997
00:39:48,560 --> 00:39:50,560
Just keep that in mind

998
00:39:50,560 --> 00:39:52,560
next time. Just say I want a Big McChicken.

999
00:39:52,560 --> 00:39:54,560
It's a triple down basically.

1000
00:39:56,560 --> 00:39:58,560
Now wait. I have a question for you.

1001
00:39:58,560 --> 00:40:00,560
How do you do onus and not

1002
00:40:00,560 --> 00:40:02,560
address the McNizzle?

1003
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:04,560
Oh, it doesn't exist.

1004
00:40:12,560 --> 00:40:14,560
I think it's not real.

1005
00:40:14,560 --> 00:40:16,560
You guys want to take some audience questions?

1006
00:40:16,560 --> 00:40:18,560
Yeah, we can start that.

1007
00:40:18,560 --> 00:40:20,560
Who has a question that's good?

1008
00:40:20,560 --> 00:40:22,560
Justin, do you want to point them out

1009
00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:24,560
so the whole onus is on you?

1010
00:40:24,560 --> 00:40:26,560
Do you want to point out the people?

1011
00:40:26,560 --> 00:40:28,560
Sir, right here. Come on down.

1012
00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:30,560
Come on down.

1013
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:36,560
I apologize you

1014
00:40:36,560 --> 00:40:38,560
aren't going to get the best view of this show

1015
00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:40,560
but we'll get you back.

1016
00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:42,560
What's your answer?

1017
00:40:42,560 --> 00:40:44,560
I'm Marco.

1018
00:40:44,560 --> 00:40:46,560
Marco, is this a good question?

1019
00:40:48,560 --> 00:40:50,560
No, I don't think it's a bummer question.

1020
00:40:50,560 --> 00:40:52,560
Oh, hold on.

1021
00:40:52,560 --> 00:40:54,560
There was a second half of it.

1022
00:40:54,560 --> 00:40:56,560
I don't think it's a bummer question.

1023
00:40:56,560 --> 00:40:58,560
Last time we did a live show we had people come up

1024
00:40:58,560 --> 00:41:00,560
and be like, oh, no, it's great, it's great, it's great.

1025
00:41:00,560 --> 00:41:02,560
Girlfriend just laughed at me and...

1026
00:41:02,560 --> 00:41:04,560
All right, Marco.

1027
00:41:04,560 --> 00:41:06,560
All right, so I'm the oldest of four

1028
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:10,560
and I've always gotten along fine with my siblings.

1029
00:41:10,560 --> 00:41:12,560
I don't have a whole lot in common with them.

1030
00:41:12,560 --> 00:41:14,560
They're more like super into sports.

1031
00:41:14,560 --> 00:41:16,560
Yeah.

1032
00:41:16,560 --> 00:41:18,560
But now we're all getting to be grownups

1033
00:41:18,560 --> 00:41:20,560
and I feel like

1034
00:41:20,560 --> 00:41:22,560
there are so many families that have

1035
00:41:22,560 --> 00:41:24,560
so much tight sibling bonding.

1036
00:41:24,560 --> 00:41:28,560
How do I get to be friends with my siblings?

1037
00:41:28,560 --> 00:41:30,560
It's easy.

1038
00:41:30,560 --> 00:41:32,560
You've got to find financial incentives.

1039
00:41:32,560 --> 00:41:34,560
Start a podcast so you can pay the bills.

1040
00:41:36,560 --> 00:41:38,560
I mean, before we had the podcast

1041
00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:40,560
it was sports for us.

1042
00:41:40,560 --> 00:41:42,560
All sports, 24-step.

1043
00:41:42,560 --> 00:41:44,560
So you have three brothers?

1044
00:41:44,560 --> 00:41:46,560
One sister, two brothers.

1045
00:41:46,560 --> 00:41:48,560
One sister, two brothers.

1046
00:41:48,560 --> 00:41:50,560
Are all three of them into sports?

1047
00:41:50,560 --> 00:41:52,560
Yeah, she's like a business school

1048
00:41:52,560 --> 00:41:54,560
marketing kind of person.

1049
00:41:54,560 --> 00:41:56,560
Just kind of like pop culture.

1050
00:41:56,560 --> 00:41:58,560
Which one's your favorite?

1051
00:41:58,560 --> 00:42:00,560
Which one's my best?

1052
00:42:00,560 --> 00:42:02,560
You can be honest.

1053
00:42:02,560 --> 00:42:04,560
She sounds like the best.

1054
00:42:04,560 --> 00:42:06,560
Your brothers are into sports.

1055
00:42:06,560 --> 00:42:08,560
Okay, so it sounds like I've figured out the problem, Marco.

1056
00:42:08,560 --> 00:42:10,560
You're the odd dog.

1057
00:42:10,560 --> 00:42:12,560
You're the odd man out.

1058
00:42:12,560 --> 00:42:14,560
You've got to realign everything

1059
00:42:14,560 --> 00:42:16,560
you think is worthwhile and valuable.

1060
00:42:16,560 --> 00:42:20,560
You've got to stop liking the things you like

1061
00:42:20,560 --> 00:42:22,560
and like the things you hate.

1062
00:42:22,560 --> 00:42:24,560
But if you can teach yourself to do that

1063
00:42:24,560 --> 00:42:26,560
you have given yourself the ability

1064
00:42:26,560 --> 00:42:28,560
to like everything in the world.

1065
00:42:28,560 --> 00:42:30,560
Love me.

1066
00:42:30,560 --> 00:42:32,560
Should we cancel the show now?

1067
00:42:34,560 --> 00:42:36,560
Was that it?

1068
00:42:36,560 --> 00:42:38,560
Was that everything?

1069
00:42:38,560 --> 00:42:40,560
You could get a really specific sports knowledge.

1070
00:42:40,560 --> 00:42:42,560
I think that's a good...

1071
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:44,560
You pick one team...

1072
00:42:44,560 --> 00:42:46,560
You have a really great highlight.

1073
00:42:46,560 --> 00:42:48,560
If you get deep into a sports

1074
00:42:48,560 --> 00:42:50,560
well that they have no knowledge of

1075
00:42:50,560 --> 00:42:52,560
they will just assume you have a base level

1076
00:42:52,560 --> 00:42:54,560
of sports knowledge.

1077
00:42:54,560 --> 00:42:56,560
You can build off that.

1078
00:42:56,560 --> 00:42:58,560
The onus then becomes on them.

1079
00:42:58,560 --> 00:43:00,560
They're in the highlight, just like you.

1080
00:43:00,560 --> 00:43:02,560
That's a great plan until the first time

1081
00:43:02,560 --> 00:43:04,560
you try to watch a football game with them

1082
00:43:04,560 --> 00:43:06,560
and they're like touchdown!

1083
00:43:06,560 --> 00:43:08,560
So basically, Justin, your advice sounds like

1084
00:43:08,560 --> 00:43:10,560
what you should do is instead of

1085
00:43:10,560 --> 00:43:12,560
alienating his brothers and sister

1086
00:43:12,560 --> 00:43:14,560
because he's not in the sports

1087
00:43:14,560 --> 00:43:16,560
he should alienate them by being into a sport

1088
00:43:16,560 --> 00:43:18,560
they know nothing about.

1089
00:43:18,560 --> 00:43:20,560
The numbers aren't in your favor right now.

1090
00:43:20,560 --> 00:43:22,560
In this family game

1091
00:43:22,560 --> 00:43:24,560
you're losing 3-1.

1092
00:43:24,560 --> 00:43:26,560
Maybe you pick a specific sportsman

1093
00:43:26,560 --> 00:43:28,560
to get super into.

1094
00:43:28,560 --> 00:43:30,560
And you try to inject him

1095
00:43:30,560 --> 00:43:32,560
into every sports conversation.

1096
00:43:32,560 --> 00:43:34,560
Yeah, Jordan's great.

1097
00:43:34,560 --> 00:43:36,560
He's no Flick Rickleson.

1098
00:43:36,560 --> 00:43:38,560
Flick Rickleson, you know her?

1099
00:43:38,560 --> 00:43:40,560
This man can hook a ball at a wall

1100
00:43:40,560 --> 00:43:42,560
and another man will catch it.

1101
00:43:42,560 --> 00:43:44,560
How does highlight work?

1102
00:43:44,560 --> 00:43:46,560
I just know the ball travels extremely fast.

1103
00:43:46,560 --> 00:43:48,560
Some are scoops and then concussions.

1104
00:43:48,560 --> 00:43:50,560
Yeah, it's a very dangerous sport.

1105
00:43:50,560 --> 00:43:52,560
So my advice would be that

1106
00:43:52,560 --> 00:43:54,560
the desire to want to be close to them

1107
00:43:54,560 --> 00:43:56,560
and get along with them seems to me

1108
00:43:56,560 --> 00:43:58,560
like it would override everything else.

1109
00:43:58,560 --> 00:44:00,560
And something like setting out and saying

1110
00:44:00,560 --> 00:44:02,560
I'm going to make this work because

1111
00:44:02,560 --> 00:44:04,560
it is important to me, I'm going to make it a priority

1112
00:44:04,560 --> 00:44:06,560
is really all you need to do.

1113
00:44:06,560 --> 00:44:08,560
Because everything else is just icing.

1114
00:44:08,560 --> 00:44:10,560
But the relationships between you

1115
00:44:10,560 --> 00:44:12,560
and your brothers and your sister

1116
00:44:12,560 --> 00:44:14,560
is something that if you say this is a priority

1117
00:44:14,560 --> 00:44:16,560
and I'm going to make this work

1118
00:44:16,560 --> 00:44:18,560
and I'm going to stay close to them

1119
00:44:18,560 --> 00:44:20,560
and become close to them, everything else is done.

1120
00:44:20,560 --> 00:44:22,560
Some relationships take more work.

1121
00:44:22,560 --> 00:44:24,560
Some of them are natural effects,

1122
00:44:24,560 --> 00:44:26,560
like you just click with people.

1123
00:44:26,560 --> 00:44:28,560
But if it's your family,

1124
00:44:28,560 --> 00:44:30,560
then maybe you have to force it a little bit.

1125
00:44:30,560 --> 00:44:32,560
I mean, really, yes, I hate these two.

1126
00:44:32,560 --> 00:44:34,560
But you find the things...

1127
00:44:34,560 --> 00:44:36,560
Interests don't have to be what you have in common.

1128
00:44:36,560 --> 00:44:38,560
The common desire is wanting to get along.

1129
00:44:38,560 --> 00:44:40,560
The common desire is wanting to be close.

1130
00:44:40,560 --> 00:44:42,560
And then you build off of that and say,

1131
00:44:42,560 --> 00:44:44,560
hey, I will go with you to see a football game

1132
00:44:44,560 --> 00:44:46,560
and you come with me to see a weird live show

1133
00:44:46,560 --> 00:44:48,560
where three dudes get up and talk about grenades and vagina.

1134
00:44:48,560 --> 00:44:50,560
Talk about you.

1135
00:44:50,560 --> 00:44:52,560
Talk about you.

1136
00:44:52,560 --> 00:44:54,560
It'll be great.

1137
00:44:54,560 --> 00:44:56,560
Does that help?

1138
00:44:56,560 --> 00:44:58,560
Yeah. Thanks, Mark.

1139
00:44:58,560 --> 00:45:00,560
Anybody else?

1140
00:45:00,560 --> 00:45:02,560
Want to help?

1141
00:45:02,560 --> 00:45:04,560
I saw the hand go first right there.

1142
00:45:04,560 --> 00:45:06,560
Yes, stand up.

1143
00:45:06,560 --> 00:45:08,560
Yes, yes, perfect.

1144
00:45:08,560 --> 00:45:10,560
Come on down.

1145
00:45:10,560 --> 00:45:12,560
Oh, boy.

1146
00:45:12,560 --> 00:45:14,560
Oh, hello.

1147
00:45:14,560 --> 00:45:16,560
Hey, everybody.

1148
00:45:16,560 --> 00:45:18,560
It's your family friend, Laura Frye.

1149
00:45:18,560 --> 00:45:20,560
You don't know Laura,

1150
00:45:20,560 --> 00:45:22,560
but hey, everybody, it's Laura.

1151
00:45:22,560 --> 00:45:24,560
Hello, Laura.

1152
00:45:24,560 --> 00:45:26,560
Laura, how can we help?

1153
00:45:26,560 --> 00:45:28,560
Laura, how can we help?

1154
00:45:28,560 --> 00:45:30,560
Is it sad or about poop or...?

1155
00:45:30,560 --> 00:45:32,560
Okay.

1156
00:45:32,560 --> 00:45:34,560
So we are headed to the beach

1157
00:45:34,560 --> 00:45:36,560
in a few weeks

1158
00:45:36,560 --> 00:45:38,560
and we have a great friend who we love

1159
00:45:38,560 --> 00:45:40,560
but who's going with us.

1160
00:45:40,560 --> 00:45:42,560
Happens to be one of those friends, though,

1161
00:45:42,560 --> 00:45:44,560
that every story you say,

1162
00:45:44,560 --> 00:45:46,560
he possibly has one that tosses in.

1163
00:45:46,560 --> 00:45:48,560
I mean, constantly.

1164
00:45:48,560 --> 00:45:50,560
So how do we spend nine hours

1165
00:45:50,560 --> 00:45:52,560
and not jump out of the car?

1166
00:45:52,560 --> 00:45:54,560
Can you mouth his name to us

1167
00:45:54,560 --> 00:45:56,560
if we know who he is so we just don't...

1168
00:45:56,560 --> 00:45:58,560
Like, it won't come up.

1169
00:45:58,560 --> 00:46:00,560
Oh, nobody from home.

1170
00:46:00,560 --> 00:46:02,560
Nobody from H now.

1171
00:46:02,560 --> 00:46:04,560
Can you top...

1172
00:46:04,560 --> 00:46:06,560
Can you re-top?

1173
00:46:06,560 --> 00:46:08,560
Can you re-top?

1174
00:46:08,560 --> 00:46:10,560
Oh, yes, you can.

1175
00:46:10,560 --> 00:46:12,560
Cool story.

1176
00:46:12,560 --> 00:46:14,560
That made me remember another one

1177
00:46:14,560 --> 00:46:16,560
that's even better

1178
00:46:16,560 --> 00:46:18,560
than the one you told me just then.

1179
00:46:18,560 --> 00:46:20,560
Like, maybe...

1180
00:46:20,560 --> 00:46:22,560
And if he...

1181
00:46:22,560 --> 00:46:24,560
If he does not realize

1182
00:46:24,560 --> 00:46:26,560
that he is being

1183
00:46:26,560 --> 00:46:28,560
inceptioned by the, like,

1184
00:46:28,560 --> 00:46:30,560
third or fourth time...

1185
00:46:30,560 --> 00:46:32,560
Cool thing, Greg.

1186
00:46:32,560 --> 00:46:34,560
You know what? It's so funny that you said that

1187
00:46:34,560 --> 00:46:36,560
again after the thing I said after the thing you said.

1188
00:46:36,560 --> 00:46:38,560
Oh, no, shit!

1189
00:46:38,560 --> 00:46:40,560
Tell your first story again!

1190
00:46:40,560 --> 00:46:42,560
Like, that reminds me of a story!

1191
00:46:42,560 --> 00:46:44,560
Drop your original one!

1192
00:46:44,560 --> 00:46:46,560
Yes!

1193
00:46:46,560 --> 00:46:48,560
But then he's going to do the same thing

1194
00:46:48,560 --> 00:46:50,560
and then you will both die the whole day.

1195
00:46:50,560 --> 00:46:52,560
What about...

1196
00:46:52,560 --> 00:46:54,560
Turn on some tunes.

1197
00:46:54,560 --> 00:46:56,560
Turn on some...

1198
00:46:56,560 --> 00:46:58,560
Tell the most boring stories you can

1199
00:46:58,560 --> 00:47:00,560
think of. Just really lob them

1200
00:47:00,560 --> 00:47:02,560
like a slow ball, but on top of that, like,

1201
00:47:02,560 --> 00:47:04,560
one time I ate a sandwich, like, nailed it.

1202
00:47:04,560 --> 00:47:06,560
You got it.

1203
00:47:06,560 --> 00:47:08,560
Don't put yourself

1204
00:47:08,560 --> 00:47:10,560
in this situation.

1205
00:47:10,560 --> 00:47:12,560
Do you have a car? Do you have a luggage rack?

1206
00:47:14,560 --> 00:47:16,560
Can you put some peanut butter

1207
00:47:16,560 --> 00:47:18,560
in his mouth?

1208
00:47:18,560 --> 00:47:20,560
Is there gonna be a lot of

1209
00:47:20,560 --> 00:47:22,560
peanut butter?

1210
00:47:22,560 --> 00:47:24,560
How much peanut butter does it take?

1211
00:47:24,560 --> 00:47:26,560
How much peanut butter does it take

1212
00:47:26,560 --> 00:47:28,560
a man to eat nine hours?

1213
00:47:28,560 --> 00:47:30,560
What's it, the cubic volume of a man's mouth?

1214
00:47:30,560 --> 00:47:32,560
It's gonna look...

1215
00:47:32,560 --> 00:47:34,560
By the end of the road trip, it's gonna look

1216
00:47:34,560 --> 00:47:36,560
a little bit like Dumbledore in your backseat.

1217
00:47:36,560 --> 00:47:38,560
I warn you.

1218
00:47:38,560 --> 00:47:40,560
I don't remember what it was like.

1219
00:47:40,560 --> 00:47:42,560
Did that help?

1220
00:47:42,560 --> 00:47:44,560
So much.

1221
00:47:44,560 --> 00:47:48,560
Is there anyone here?

1222
00:47:48,560 --> 00:47:50,560
Do you want to write?

1223
00:47:50,560 --> 00:47:52,560
Sorry?

1224
00:47:52,560 --> 00:47:54,560
Anyone in?

1225
00:47:54,560 --> 00:47:56,560
This guy who was sent in by Derek Engel.

1226
00:47:56,560 --> 00:47:58,560
Thank you, Derek.

1227
00:47:58,560 --> 00:48:00,560
It is by...

1228
00:48:00,560 --> 00:48:02,560
Brandon Lambkin, you asked.

1229
00:48:02,560 --> 00:48:04,560
Don't put your full name on the line.

1230
00:48:06,560 --> 00:48:08,560
Is it okay to trim

1231
00:48:08,560 --> 00:48:10,560
my dog's pubic hair?

1232
00:48:10,560 --> 00:48:12,560
Guys,

1233
00:48:12,560 --> 00:48:14,560
can we be delicate

1234
00:48:14,560 --> 00:48:16,560
in the representation of an owl or a bee?

1235
00:48:16,560 --> 00:48:18,560
Can we just help, please?

1236
00:48:20,560 --> 00:48:22,560
I just got a dog

1237
00:48:22,560 --> 00:48:24,560
for my fiancé, and it is about

1238
00:48:24,560 --> 00:48:26,560
five to six months old.

1239
00:48:26,560 --> 00:48:28,560
Dogs get pubes at five to six months old?

1240
00:48:30,560 --> 00:48:32,560
A little intimidating.

1241
00:48:32,560 --> 00:48:34,560
Yeah.

1242
00:48:34,560 --> 00:48:36,560
When she rolls over, you can see

1243
00:48:36,560 --> 00:48:40,560
extremely long pubic hair.

1244
00:48:42,560 --> 00:48:44,560
Is it okay for me to trim it,

1245
00:48:44,560 --> 00:48:46,560
or will it affect the dog?

1246
00:48:46,560 --> 00:48:48,560
It'll affect the dog, probably.

1247
00:48:50,560 --> 00:48:52,560
It will affect the dog's gait,

1248
00:48:52,560 --> 00:48:54,560
I bet.

1249
00:48:54,560 --> 00:48:56,560
And their general mood probs.

1250
00:49:00,560 --> 00:49:02,560
Chaz, you worked at a kennel for a while,

1251
00:49:02,560 --> 00:49:04,560
and I know that your specialty was

1252
00:49:04,560 --> 00:49:06,560
to trim your ears.

1253
00:49:06,560 --> 00:49:08,560
Okay, I was going to give them a fair warning.

1254
00:49:08,560 --> 00:49:10,560
A spoiler warning, because it's going to

1255
00:49:10,560 --> 00:49:12,560
spoil your day.

1256
00:49:12,560 --> 00:49:14,560
I squeeze dog buttholes.

1257
00:49:14,560 --> 00:49:16,560
I was known for it.

1258
00:49:16,560 --> 00:49:18,560
Fastest hands in the West.

1259
00:49:20,560 --> 00:49:22,560
There's a gland...

1260
00:49:22,560 --> 00:49:24,560
I don't know why dogs...

1261
00:49:24,560 --> 00:49:26,560
Hold on.

1262
00:49:26,560 --> 00:49:28,560
Time out.

1263
00:49:28,560 --> 00:49:30,560
There's a gland back there

1264
00:49:30,560 --> 00:49:32,560
that makes stinky.

1265
00:49:32,560 --> 00:49:34,560
Why do they need that in their life?

1266
00:49:34,560 --> 00:49:36,560
Hey, you know how many awesome things

1267
00:49:36,560 --> 00:49:38,560
I gave dogs?

1268
00:49:38,560 --> 00:49:40,560
Check this out.

1269
00:49:40,560 --> 00:49:42,560
We're going to balance it all out.

1270
00:49:42,560 --> 00:49:44,560
Put a thing in their butthole,

1271
00:49:44,560 --> 00:49:46,560
people are going to squeeze.

1272
00:49:46,560 --> 00:49:48,560
Here's my question about dog pubes.

1273
00:49:48,560 --> 00:49:50,560
I guess my question is...

1274
00:49:50,560 --> 00:49:52,560
Talking about dog pubes now after that

1275
00:49:52,560 --> 00:49:54,560
is weirdly refreshing.

1276
00:49:54,560 --> 00:49:56,560
Is this person's concern

1277
00:49:56,560 --> 00:49:58,560
if they don't trim these pubes?

1278
00:49:58,560 --> 00:50:00,560
It's entirely aesthetic.

1279
00:50:00,560 --> 00:50:02,560
Okay, great.

1280
00:50:02,560 --> 00:50:04,560
I just don't want people to judge my dog's

1281
00:50:04,560 --> 00:50:06,560
super long pubic hair.

1282
00:50:06,560 --> 00:50:08,560
Have you seen Steve's dog's pubic hair?

1283
00:50:08,560 --> 00:50:10,560
Jesus.

1284
00:50:10,560 --> 00:50:12,560
They want to trim that shit.

1285
00:50:12,560 --> 00:50:14,560
Got stuck on the wrong nose.

1286
00:50:20,560 --> 00:50:22,560
I guess my question is...

1287
00:50:22,560 --> 00:50:24,560
Where does that region

1288
00:50:24,560 --> 00:50:26,560
end and begin?

1289
00:50:26,560 --> 00:50:28,560
Is there a definitive...

1290
00:50:28,560 --> 00:50:30,560
That's tummy hair.

1291
00:50:30,560 --> 00:50:32,560
Tummy hair stops here.

1292
00:50:32,560 --> 00:50:34,560
Look at that bush!

1293
00:50:34,560 --> 00:50:36,560
I think you have to put a bikini

1294
00:50:36,560 --> 00:50:38,560
on the dog.

1295
00:50:48,560 --> 00:50:50,560
I guess the real question is,

1296
00:50:50,560 --> 00:50:52,560
do you bleach their asses off?

1297
00:50:52,560 --> 00:50:54,560
Travis!

1298
00:50:54,560 --> 00:50:56,560
We were all thinking him.

1299
00:50:56,560 --> 00:50:58,560
There's not a single person here.

1300
00:50:58,560 --> 00:51:00,560
They will be asked to leave.

1301
00:51:00,560 --> 00:51:02,560
Raise your hand.

1302
00:51:02,560 --> 00:51:04,560
The smile this guy was giving us

1303
00:51:04,560 --> 00:51:06,560
when he put his hand...

1304
00:51:06,560 --> 00:51:08,560
Goddamn it.

1305
00:51:08,560 --> 00:51:10,560
It's burning right in the air.

1306
00:51:10,560 --> 00:51:12,560
Is there anybody else

1307
00:51:12,560 --> 00:51:14,560
whose look we can see

1308
00:51:14,560 --> 00:51:16,560
and make fun of?

1309
00:51:16,560 --> 00:51:18,560
You must have a weird look.

1310
00:51:18,560 --> 00:51:20,560
Why would hair grow

1311
00:51:20,560 --> 00:51:22,560
faster than the hair on the rest of the body?

1312
00:51:22,560 --> 00:51:24,560
Is there a breed where it's

1313
00:51:24,560 --> 00:51:26,560
just like a bushy breed?

1314
00:51:26,560 --> 00:51:28,560
Just like Chihuahua.

1315
00:51:28,560 --> 00:51:30,560
You gotta maintain that shit

1316
00:51:30,560 --> 00:51:32,560
before it gets out of hand.

1317
00:51:32,560 --> 00:51:34,560
Going up here, we're really trainable.

1318
00:51:34,560 --> 00:51:36,560
I'm Iranian, smart,

1319
00:51:36,560 --> 00:51:38,560
but kind of standoffish.

1320
00:51:38,560 --> 00:51:40,560
And like the Yorkshire Terrier,

1321
00:51:40,560 --> 00:51:42,560
huge bush.

1322
00:51:42,560 --> 00:51:44,560
There's just no going into it.

1323
00:51:46,560 --> 00:51:48,560
Who here loves talking about dog bush?

1324
00:51:50,560 --> 00:51:52,560
That's okay.

1325
00:51:52,560 --> 00:51:54,560
Do we have another audience question?

1326
00:51:56,560 --> 00:51:58,560
Dog down!

1327
00:51:58,560 --> 00:52:00,560
Let's say it right there.

1328
00:52:00,560 --> 00:52:02,560
Come on down.

1329
00:52:02,560 --> 00:52:04,560
Everybody give him some applause.

1330
00:52:04,560 --> 00:52:06,560
He hasn't done anything

1331
00:52:06,560 --> 00:52:08,560
in this room.

1332
00:52:08,560 --> 00:52:10,560
Dead air is like weird.

1333
00:52:10,560 --> 00:52:12,560
What is your name sir?

1334
00:52:12,560 --> 00:52:14,560
My name is Ryan.

1335
00:52:14,560 --> 00:52:16,560
My younger brother

1336
00:52:16,560 --> 00:52:18,560
is about to leave for college.

1337
00:52:18,560 --> 00:52:20,560
I moved home since then.

1338
00:52:20,560 --> 00:52:22,560
How do I deal with being

1339
00:52:22,560 --> 00:52:24,560
basically the only child again

1340
00:52:24,560 --> 00:52:26,560
for the first time since I was five?

1341
00:52:26,560 --> 00:52:28,560
Is there a wall between your bedrooms?

1342
00:52:28,560 --> 00:52:30,560
Take it out.

1343
00:52:30,560 --> 00:52:32,560
Look who's here!

1344
00:52:32,560 --> 00:52:34,560
King Ryan!

1345
00:52:38,560 --> 00:52:40,560
Ryan's gonna do

1346
00:52:40,560 --> 00:52:42,560
a little reworking

1347
00:52:42,560 --> 00:52:44,560
on the house.

1348
00:52:44,560 --> 00:52:46,560
He's gonna take that wall,

1349
00:52:46,560 --> 00:52:48,560
clean the fuck out.

1350
00:52:48,560 --> 00:52:50,560
Ryan, if I might suggest,

1351
00:52:50,560 --> 00:52:52,560
you could also just totally regress

1352
00:52:52,560 --> 00:52:54,560
and be like, I'm the only child now.

1353
00:52:54,560 --> 00:52:56,560
Take care of baby Ryan.

1354
00:52:56,560 --> 00:52:58,560
Oh, take care of me?

1355
00:52:58,560 --> 00:53:00,560
I want ice cream.

1356
00:53:00,560 --> 00:53:02,560
Ice cream, daddy ice cream.

1357
00:53:02,560 --> 00:53:04,560
Buy me a dinosaur copy.

1358
00:53:04,560 --> 00:53:06,560
Baby, I want all the toys

1359
00:53:06,560 --> 00:53:08,560
on Toy Store.

1360
00:53:08,560 --> 00:53:10,560
Baby, you gotta love me.

1361
00:53:10,560 --> 00:53:12,560
Wait for the show dinosaur.

1362
00:53:12,560 --> 00:53:14,560
Wait for the show dinosaur.

1363
00:53:14,560 --> 00:53:16,560
Yeah, let's hear it for dinosaur.

1364
00:53:16,560 --> 00:53:18,560
The show is on ABC Family.

1365
00:53:18,560 --> 00:53:20,560
Should we talk about

1366
00:53:20,560 --> 00:53:22,560
the plot of dinosaur?

1367
00:53:22,560 --> 00:53:24,560
I mean, the bit where we talked

1368
00:53:24,560 --> 00:53:26,560
about the plot of pay-for-wear

1369
00:53:26,560 --> 00:53:28,560
was such a joint hit.

1370
00:53:28,560 --> 00:53:30,560
Are you sad, Ryan?

1371
00:53:30,560 --> 00:53:32,560
Just in general?

1372
00:53:32,560 --> 00:53:34,560
I mean, what's your day-to-day

1373
00:53:34,560 --> 00:53:36,560
happiness look like?

1374
00:53:36,560 --> 00:53:38,560
I mean, that's your brother leaving.

1375
00:53:38,560 --> 00:53:40,560
Does it make you sad?

1376
00:53:40,560 --> 00:53:42,560
Yeah.

1377
00:53:42,560 --> 00:53:44,560
I mean,

1378
00:53:44,560 --> 00:53:46,560
what would you say

1379
00:53:46,560 --> 00:53:48,560
your actual question was?

1380
00:53:48,560 --> 00:53:50,560
Let's pretend that some people

1381
00:53:50,560 --> 00:53:52,560
might not have been paying

1382
00:53:52,560 --> 00:53:54,560
super close attention.

1383
00:53:54,560 --> 00:53:56,560
Because they were thinking

1384
00:53:56,560 --> 00:53:58,560
about a bit they were gonna do

1385
00:53:58,560 --> 00:54:00,560
with you taking the wall down.

1386
00:54:00,560 --> 00:54:02,560
And they didn't actually hear the question

1387
00:54:02,560 --> 00:54:04,560
that you needed help with.

1388
00:54:04,560 --> 00:54:06,560
This is kind of a thought experiment

1389
00:54:06,560 --> 00:54:08,560
that we do so far on the show.

1390
00:54:08,560 --> 00:54:10,560
So what would you say

1391
00:54:10,560 --> 00:54:12,560
your actual question was?

1392
00:54:12,560 --> 00:54:14,560
You know, what are some tips

1393
00:54:14,560 --> 00:54:16,560
for being the only...

1394
00:54:16,560 --> 00:54:18,560
The only child?

1395
00:54:18,560 --> 00:54:20,560
Could you pretend like your brother had died

1396
00:54:20,560 --> 00:54:22,560
and you guys didn't talk about

1397
00:54:22,560 --> 00:54:24,560
the horrible accident?

1398
00:54:24,560 --> 00:54:26,560
Oh, yeah.

1399
00:54:26,560 --> 00:54:28,560
What was that sound?

1400
00:54:28,560 --> 00:54:30,560
Travis hitting the nail on the head

1401
00:54:30,560 --> 00:54:32,560
with a hammer.

1402
00:54:32,560 --> 00:54:34,560
Pretend your brother died.

1403
00:54:34,560 --> 00:54:36,560
He's dead now.

1404
00:54:36,560 --> 00:54:38,560
Great comedy show, everybody.

1405
00:54:38,560 --> 00:54:44,560
What are you doing?

1406
00:54:44,560 --> 00:54:46,560
Ironically, the idea of my brother

1407
00:54:46,560 --> 00:54:52,560
dying is bringing me some relief.

1408
00:54:52,560 --> 00:54:54,560
Oh, yikes.

1409
00:54:54,560 --> 00:54:56,560
Oh, man.

1410
00:54:58,560 --> 00:55:00,560
But the other side of that is

1411
00:55:00,560 --> 00:55:02,560
when you pretend like he died

1412
00:55:02,560 --> 00:55:04,560
but then he comes home from college

1413
00:55:04,560 --> 00:55:06,560
and isn't dying.

1414
00:55:06,560 --> 00:55:12,560
It's basically a deposit you're making

1415
00:55:12,560 --> 00:55:14,560
on a future miracle.

1416
00:55:16,560 --> 00:55:18,560
Miracles are really just the reversal

1417
00:55:18,560 --> 00:55:22,560
of lies you started believing.

1418
00:55:22,560 --> 00:55:24,560
God, you are dropping some

1419
00:55:24,560 --> 00:55:26,560
Mahatma shit over here.

1420
00:55:26,560 --> 00:55:28,560
It's getting real in here.

1421
00:55:28,560 --> 00:55:30,560
I think all of that helped.

1422
00:55:30,560 --> 00:55:32,560
Yeah, you're welcome.

1423
00:55:32,560 --> 00:55:34,560
I'm pretty confident

1424
00:55:34,560 --> 00:55:36,560
you're gonna make it.

1425
00:55:36,560 --> 00:55:38,560
Thank you, Ryan.

1426
00:55:38,560 --> 00:55:40,560
We're done?

1427
00:55:40,560 --> 00:55:42,560
Thank you so much, first off,

1428
00:55:42,560 --> 00:55:44,560
to the People's Improved Theater

1429
00:55:44,560 --> 00:55:46,560
for having us here.

1430
00:55:46,560 --> 00:55:48,560
Holy shit, they've been incredible.

1431
00:55:48,560 --> 00:55:50,560
We talked about this before

1432
00:55:50,560 --> 00:55:52,560
and no fucking idea what we're doing

1433
00:55:52,560 --> 00:55:54,560
in this department.

1434
00:55:54,560 --> 00:55:56,560
They've done everything.

1435
00:55:56,560 --> 00:55:58,560
Most of the people here

1436
00:55:58,560 --> 00:56:00,560
were people that missed out on tickets

1437
00:56:00,560 --> 00:56:02,560
to the second two shows.

1438
00:56:02,560 --> 00:56:04,560
We're doing more?

1439
00:56:04,560 --> 00:56:06,560
Yeah.

1440
00:56:06,560 --> 00:56:08,560
It's gonna be really exhausting

1441
00:56:08,560 --> 00:56:10,560
but we did it for you

1442
00:56:10,560 --> 00:56:12,560
so I was thinking

1443
00:56:12,560 --> 00:56:14,560
maybe a hand for us.

1444
00:56:24,560 --> 00:56:26,560
Because you guys were standing outside

1445
00:56:26,560 --> 00:56:28,560
like weirdos,

1446
00:56:28,560 --> 00:56:30,560
you probably might have missed

1447
00:56:30,560 --> 00:56:32,560
our new merch table.

1448
00:56:32,560 --> 00:56:34,560
I bring this up not for us

1449
00:56:34,560 --> 00:56:36,560
but for you.

1450
00:56:36,560 --> 00:56:38,560
I don't want you...

1451
00:56:38,560 --> 00:56:40,560
We don't know how to sell this online.

1452
00:56:40,560 --> 00:56:42,560
We don't know how the internet works.

1453
00:56:42,560 --> 00:56:44,560
I'll start with the coolest thing.

1454
00:56:44,560 --> 00:56:46,560
It's so small,

1455
00:56:46,560 --> 00:56:48,560
nobody can describe it.

1456
00:56:48,560 --> 00:56:50,560
It's a sweet-ass patch

1457
00:56:50,560 --> 00:56:52,560
to be a fraternal order of brothers

1458
00:56:52,560 --> 00:56:54,560
with an awesome horse in front of the moon.

1459
00:56:54,560 --> 00:56:56,560
We got button packs

1460
00:56:56,560 --> 00:56:58,560
and these brand new beautiful tote bags.

1461
00:56:58,560 --> 00:57:00,560
They pack your bags and move way tote bag.

1462
00:57:00,560 --> 00:57:02,560
We've got some really cool

1463
00:57:02,560 --> 00:57:04,560
bumper stickers and everything.

1464
00:57:04,560 --> 00:57:06,560
More importantly, even if you don't grab anything

1465
00:57:06,560 --> 00:57:08,560
on your way out, grab one of these postcards

1466
00:57:08,560 --> 00:57:10,560
and if you use the coupon code...

1467
00:57:10,560 --> 00:57:12,560
I won't say it out loud

1468
00:57:12,560 --> 00:57:14,560
but use the coupon code.

1469
00:57:14,560 --> 00:57:16,560
Does everyone see the coupon code?

1470
00:57:16,560 --> 00:57:18,560
Grab the postcard on your way out

1471
00:57:18,560 --> 00:57:20,560
and it'll give you a discount

1472
00:57:20,560 --> 00:57:22,560
on your order online.

1473
00:57:22,560 --> 00:57:24,560
Make sure you grab that

1474
00:57:24,560 --> 00:57:26,560
and hang out in the bar,

1475
00:57:26,560 --> 00:57:28,560
where I was here.

1476
00:57:28,560 --> 00:57:30,560
We'll come out and say hi.

1477
00:57:30,560 --> 00:57:32,560
For like 30 seconds and then we have to do another show.

1478
00:57:32,560 --> 00:57:34,560
Yeah, whee!

1479
00:57:34,560 --> 00:57:36,560
That's your fault, remember.

1480
00:57:36,560 --> 00:57:38,560
I hate to interrupt you

1481
00:57:38,560 --> 00:57:40,560
live, Justin, but you forgot

1482
00:57:40,560 --> 00:57:42,560
to mention to thank Simple.

1483
00:57:42,560 --> 00:57:44,560
It's me.

1484
00:57:44,560 --> 00:57:46,560
Captain Kangaroo.

1485
00:57:46,560 --> 00:57:48,560
Oh, interesting. Special guest.

1486
00:57:48,560 --> 00:57:50,560
Special relevant guest,

1487
00:57:50,560 --> 00:57:52,560
Captain Kangaroo. Sorry about it, Chief.

1488
00:57:52,560 --> 00:57:54,560
But thanks to Simple rebuilding

1489
00:57:54,560 --> 00:57:56,560
banking from the ground up the way it should be.

1490
00:57:56,560 --> 00:57:58,560
Putting people before policies

1491
00:57:58,560 --> 00:58:00,560
and helping you find

1492
00:58:00,560 --> 00:58:02,560
clarity in your finances.

1493
00:58:02,560 --> 00:58:04,560
I'm having a stroke, buddy.

1494
00:58:04,560 --> 00:58:06,560
You can skip the waitlist at Simple.com

1495
00:58:06,560 --> 00:58:08,560
slash my brother, Captain Kangaroo.

1496
00:58:08,560 --> 00:58:10,560
Back to you, J-Man.

1497
00:58:10,560 --> 00:58:12,560
I want to thank

1498
00:58:12,560 --> 00:58:14,560
Sawbones for opening

1499
00:58:14,560 --> 00:58:16,560
for us.

1500
00:58:16,560 --> 00:58:18,560
Thank you, guys.

1501
00:58:18,560 --> 00:58:20,560
Thank you, guys.

1502
00:58:20,560 --> 00:58:22,560
Thank you, guys.

1503
00:58:22,560 --> 00:58:24,560
Thank you, guys.

1504
00:58:24,560 --> 00:58:26,560
I learned a lot about my body

1505
00:58:26,560 --> 00:58:28,560
during that episode. Yeah, me too.

1506
00:58:28,560 --> 00:58:30,560
I'm all warts under

1507
00:58:30,560 --> 00:58:32,560
my shirt.

1508
00:58:32,560 --> 00:58:34,560
If I took my shirt off,

1509
00:58:34,560 --> 00:58:36,560
I'm bristling with

1510
00:58:36,560 --> 00:58:38,560
warts.

1511
00:58:38,560 --> 00:58:40,560
I'm bristling with anticipation for that.

1512
00:58:40,560 --> 00:58:42,560
Big thanks to John Roderick.

1513
00:58:44,560 --> 00:58:46,560
Special thanks to John Roderick.

1514
00:58:46,560 --> 00:58:48,560
Fuck! I missed it.

1515
00:58:48,560 --> 00:58:50,560
This final

1516
00:58:50,560 --> 00:58:52,560
answer was sent in by, I just wrote Drew.

1517
00:58:52,560 --> 00:58:54,560
I'm assuming this is Drew Davenport. Thank you, Drew.

1518
00:58:54,560 --> 00:58:56,560
It's by Yonkomancer's user,

1519
00:58:56,560 --> 00:58:58,560
Ciso Altairzio,

1520
00:58:58,560 --> 00:59:00,560
who asks,

1521
00:59:00,560 --> 00:59:02,560
Who invented cranberries?

1522
00:59:06,560 --> 00:59:08,560
I am Druster

1523
00:59:08,560 --> 00:59:10,560
Macklemore. I'm Druster Macklemore.

1524
00:59:10,560 --> 00:59:12,560
This has been my brother, our brother,

1525
00:59:12,560 --> 00:59:32,560
Druster Macklemore. Thank you, Druster.
