23
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:34,960
hilarious well that's for dinosaurs so but imagine we have to start do we have to start

24
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:38,880
annotating every time we steal a joke from dinosaurs because this show's gonna become like

25
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:46,160
one third longer this is our christmas holiday funtacular otherwise known as candle nights

26
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:54,480
is when we is a non-nominational non-traditional holiday celebration where the only real rule

27
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:59,920
is just be yourself no rules just right rules just right and also holiday out and also no cursing

28
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:05,120
there's no cursing that's i guess the only rule so one rule just right the annual did you guys

29
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:09,200
know we don't do a christmas tree we just do an awesome blossom and then we decorate that awesome

30
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:15,040
blossom and then we watch over the span of a month as it rots on the ground exactly boy the dogs are

31
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:20,480
like uh candle lights at our house when the stink is so bad that you can't be in the same house as

32
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:25,920
the candle lights awesome blossom then you throw it away and then you have a big party to celebrate

33
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:32,480
that your house doesn't smell like rotten stinky onions anymore now this of course is an advice

34
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:37,840
show i'm your oldest brother justin mcelroy i'm your middle-est brother travis mcelroy i'm your

35
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:46,080
sweet baby jesus brother griffin mcelroy guys i have almost sworn like three times already yeah

36
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:51,280
it's pretty tough it's like hanging over at nani's house and not dropping them you know it's like

37
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:56,640
one of those like psychological things where it's the don't push the red button thing like as soon

38
00:03:56,640 --> 00:04:02,240
as we announce we can't curse and then you press the red button and then a random person on earth

39
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:09,200
dies and then you get a million dollars exactly don't scratch that place there i think that the

40
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:14,240
thing that is important to know first off if it's your first time listening to us welcome we're so

41
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:22,720
happy that a family member has turned you on to our show oh wow do you want to do you want to

42
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:28,720
re-emphasize that while we will not be using curse words in the traditional sense we will

43
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:35,360
be exploring ideas that are extremely upsetting exactly to adults and children alike no cursing

44
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:42,560
but you know there was a linguistic shorthand to express some of the complicated psychosexual

45
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:49,360
ideas we will be delving into we have effectively lowered the letter grade of our of our podcast

46
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:55,280
rating down exactly one step i would like to take this time to apologize for all the screaming that

47
00:04:55,280 --> 00:05:00,640
you'll probably be hearing on my end i live on a street in austin known for its christmas light

48
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:06,720
displays and the kids are out in full force and for some reason their gut reaction to seeing a

49
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:13,440
bunch of christmas lights is to scream as if someone was beating them with a pipe they just

50
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:17,520
love the holidays i don't i haven't looked outside i don't think there's anybody is it like an excited

51
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:23,840
scream or like a horrified like how could they scream um it's it's a guttural it's just it's

52
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:28,640
just like almost like they're having a contest to see who can scream as if their their screams

53
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:33,040
illuminate the lights even brighter if as if their screams provide the lights with the precious

54
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:36,880
wattage that they need these are these are families like driving through the street right and

55
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:41,200
mostly walking we had carolers honestly i had carolers last week i didn't know how to handle

56
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:46,560
it i just stood on the porch i almost i almost asked you why parents would roll down their

57
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:51,600
windows to share their screams in the neighborhood but then i imagined the alternate personality

58
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:55,840
who's like let's keep those windows rolled up and just keep all those for me let's just

59
00:05:55,840 --> 00:06:00,960
bake in those let's hot box those screams you know actually so yesterday when justin and i

60
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:06,800
did some magic um i want everybody to i'm gonna need i'm just gonna need a quick pause to explain

61
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:13,760
we did some magic together yeah oh you need more than that like special holiday magic did you make

62
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:19,360
wishes come true for we did make it snow inside with the love in our hearts and we also went to

63
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:24,000
great wolf lodge and did magic quest oh and defeated a dragon we did it with little kid

64
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:29,040
wait we did it with a little kid present wait we did we took a little kid with us wait wait

65
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:36,800
i gave a cape to a little kid i uh this is true i bought a cape and it was eight dollars

66
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:43,040
it said magic quest on it i was wearing it to the side like a baron or shazam

67
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:51,200
it got too itchy for my neck and i i there was this little kid who was helping named ryan who

68
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:56,480
was helping travis to defeat and by little kid like four years old like four years old helping

69
00:06:56,480 --> 00:07:03,920
me shut up now and i was watching all this happen and i said uh here ryan i think you deserve this

70
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:09,680
cape more than i do and and then i handed it to him and later we were in the back of the room

71
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:15,760
we're telling this story to my father-in-law and he said that his mom was there right and i realized

72
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:21,680
that only then did i realize that giving a magical cape to a five-year-old is probably the creepiest

73
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:28,960
thing i've ever done yeah well so the point of my story here is i watched so many parents carry

74
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:34,800
their children away towards their rooms screaming like you know and and the parents just continuing

75
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:38,960
on with their conversation with each other as though the child wasn't screaming and i imagine

76
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:43,440
that it's got to be like when you decide you're gonna show your kid something awesome or take

77
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:48,560
them somewhere cool you have to know that at the end of the day they're gonna end up screaming yeah

78
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:52,880
guess what you're not a wizard anymore sorry yeah let's go you're gonna go back to being a second

79
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:57,600
grader oh you don't like that trade-off i imagine so i imagine you have to like build up you're a

80
00:07:57,600 --> 00:08:02,880
wizard harry but now you're not anymore because it's tuesday and it's time to go to bed time harry

81
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:08,560
harry now it's time to go to grandma jones harry uh so listen you know what this is still

82
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:16,720
a an advice show we should we should get out there and uh and uh and help some people let's

83
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:22,400
get our hands dirty with yule yeah my family is a rather boring one in terms of gift giving

84
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:33,040
over the past five years we've mostly exchanged looks dvd sorry books sorry i got you this look

85
00:08:33,040 --> 00:08:40,080
okay we mostly change books dvds and music my parents own electronic readers and owning physical

86
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:45,120
media is for old maids now i feel entirely unfulfilled giving out itunes codes or whatever

87
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:50,240
nonsense lets me gift digital goods should i just settle for disappointing codes as gifts

88
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:55,920
stick with increasingly obsolete formats of gifts or take an entirely different approach that's from

89
00:08:55,920 --> 00:09:03,440
luddye in lambertville first of all i don't i don't think giving dvds books and stuff is and music

90
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:11,600
is boring because if you were to cut out those three things it does not leave a lot of like other

91
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:18,480
pop culture media well no but you can reach outside of the of the pop culture realm outside

92
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:23,120
of that zone maybe you can get me a colander that's none of those things yeah but you can't

93
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:30,960
like do you can't do a year of all colanders that's true i guess i can't do that i guess he

94
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:35,440
got you there i also i'm saying like you wouldn't you wouldn't want to like when you're taking away

95
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:40,960
your hall at the end of the day just have a like a box full of kitchen goods i mean you have a point

96
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:54,080
but in my defense um it's it's kind of hard to to like strain pasta or cook broccoli um through your

97
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:59,600
through your pixar brave dvd yeah well if you only have the one you have to knit them together

98
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:03,600
into a dvd that's gonna be a i'm gonna tell you right now try that that's gonna be a pretty bad

99
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:10,400
colander i'm just saying unless you are cooking um i do appreciate that the the hand woven dvd

100
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:15,120
colander you got me last year but it is not effective what's that there are many sharks

101
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:20,480
what's that fat pasta it looks like cinnabons tortellini that's the only pasta you can do in

102
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:26,480
there and that's pretty much that's pretty much its only use did you say torbaloni i said torbalon

103
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:34,560
i said timber lake um i agree that it's not a great i think as part of a gift package uh like

104
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:40,080
as part of a suite of gifts you're getting someone a code is probably very good yeah you got the

105
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:44,160
trick to good gift giving is to mix it up like that right like get me an itunes code because i

106
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:49,680
spend roughly 450 on itunes every week and you know the more you can cut down that number for

107
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:52,880
me the more i appreciate it then get me something from the heart you know something you made with

108
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:58,160
your hands then maybe give me something awful to like temper my expectations for the fourth gift

109
00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:06,640
which is another itunes card so you want to cycle through it's the ups and downs good christmas gift

110
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:12,240
giving is really all about muscle confusion it's really all about zigging i'm doing gift i'm doing

111
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:17,760
gift insanity zigging left then zigging really hard right and then giving me an itunes you're

112
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:23,200
basically suggesting giving gifts like a senile great aunt it's basically you know uh what about

113
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:29,840
a handmade itunes gift card i love that you just stitch it together it's a post-it note and you

114
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:35,920
wrote 16 random characters on it and you said just a buck how about it etsy or you just get like a

115
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:41,520
bag with cut up letters and numbers in it and then you have them pick their own 16 digits out

116
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:46,640
oh that's that way it's like you make your own code and luck be a lady yeah something to do with

117
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:51,600
the kids you exchange it and it is actually for luck be a lady but it's actually that awful version

118
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:55,440
that that guy from the eagles did that's like uh it's kind of like a kind of like a reggae jam

119
00:11:55,440 --> 00:12:00,560
you guys i don't know i i don't know what a code is because i don't do a lot of purchasing online

120
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:06,720
um is that like you get a code for a specific album or for a specific like it's basically

121
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:12,400
just bucks usually or is it like a gift card it's so it's so hard to tell i don't i don't know how

122
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:17,040
to do it this person has a point like everything is going digital but i don't want to give i don't

123
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:21,280
want to give somebody like i don't want to give somebody like a slip of paper and say this can be

124
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:25,840
a gift this is a gift voucher you know because then you're basically your doorway to a gift

125
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:32,240
yeah isn't doesn't christmas exist so that you like i will download the music for myself on

126
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:38,080
itunes but christmas exists so you can hand me a cd like right i don't think it's about the most

127
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:44,160
convenient thing anymore it's about well let's be honest christmas is about the merch right it's

128
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:50,880
about the goods well no but what nobody wait what nobody wants to walk away from canon lights

129
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:57,280
is just no with a with a with nothing to play with right that's the thing if a nerf gun fight

130
00:12:57,280 --> 00:13:03,360
breaks out you can't fire an itunes gift well you can you can you can it's it's incredibly

131
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:09,200
dangerous and expensive because you're talking about like 10 apps you're throwing you're

132
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:14,480
weaponizing 10 apps and you're throwing it and it's very sharp i guess i don't have a good answer

133
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:20,160
so i guess the answer is you get a book and then inside of it you write the code for the

134
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:25,440
they want actually you can get the code and they'll use the code to get a gift and cool but

135
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:32,000
like please don't please don't fool yourself into thinking that you're getting a very thoughtful gift

136
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:38,560
like don't it's not but if like your family is is very utilitarian they may appreciate that they're

137
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:43,200
not gonna buy what they're not gonna take your ten dollar itunes gift card and then go buy the

138
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:48,320
greatest hits collection of billy ocean and then every time they listen to that billy ocean mp3

139
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:53,760
be like oh man thanks chuck oh man you remember when chuck hooked me up with this billy osh

140
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:58,240
the worst the worst part about gift cards is you can't impose your taste on other people

141
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:05,680
right unless you write use this to buy billy ocean on the i swear if i find out you didn't

142
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:11,840
buy billy ocean's greatest hits volumes one through ten then i am done with you hey brice

150
00:14:59,280 --> 00:15:03,600
card thank you move along thank you thanks for playing what would you do next question

151
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:12,320
okay here's our next guest so don't just sit there up until up until now my wife and i have

152
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:16,800
alternated spent in the holidays with my family one year and hers the next mine involves a rather

153
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:24,560
pricey flight out east while hers is a 5.5 sorry five and a half hour drive away we figure we're

154
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:27,440
at the age where it's time to start our own traditions and want to start spending christmas

155
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:34,880
at home this what is wrong with me i'm having a stroke here we go i want to start spending

156
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:40,960
christmas at home this isn't going to be much of an issue with my family since the cost involved

157
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:45,440
with the flight to christmas is an easy excuse however my wife's family already doesn't think

158
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:50,080
we visit enough despite the five and a half hour drive being relatively long for me as the only

159
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:56,000
driver and as soon as we start skipping the trip out east they will surely start asking why we

160
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:01,200
aren't visiting them instead i thought you might know how we could break the cycle without causing

161
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:07,600
too much family drama can somebody explain signed seeking silent nights can someone explain me what

162
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:11,920
this question is asking because it was just a bunch of in my head all i heard was a bunch

163
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:17,920
of directions it's an algebra problem i was saying two families leave the station traveling in

164
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:24,240
opposite directions at each other how much do they love each other um basically this person wants to

165
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:31,200
stop traveling at christmas and i guess the best i have for him is yeah yeah dude sorry so next but

166
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:37,200
his family every movie that like came out in the 80s and 90s about being with your family on

167
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:42,000
christmas like that's what it's all about let me reference sorry our friend jonathan taylor thomas

168
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:47,680
his performance in i'll be home for christmas okay it was awesome it was good is that your

169
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:58,560
reference we can't move on i need a quote i can't quote it i can just tell you how i felt when i

170
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:04,400
saw i need any evidence that you know what it's about at all it's about his dad wanting him to

171
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:08,880
come home for christmas and him saying he doesn't want to and so his dad offers to give him a car

172
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:12,880
if he's able to be home in time for christmas just jessica biel's in the mix right his gf

173
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:20,000
is she wants him home real bad except that some some some thugs take him don't want him home with

174
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:24,400
this gf don't want him to get that car they super glue a santa suit to him throw him in the desert

175
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:28,480
all of a sudden he's got to find his way home but he doesn't have a card he doesn't have any money

176
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:32,640
doesn't have any documentation how is jtt gonna crack this nut i'll tell you i was gonna crack

177
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:39,120
this night with his charms and his wiles well here's the thing okay so real talk of course

178
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:45,360
of course when you say to your family either side hey we don't want to come home for the holidays

179
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:51,280
their reaction is not going to be like cool dude drop us a line when like there is no way to do

180
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:56,000
this right i mean they're going to be if you're asking how to do this without making them upset

181
00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:04,240
the answer is you can't you can't do that unless unless you have a kid there it is that's the

182
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:09,440
answer you're looking for that's your only get out of jail free card because then you can say i

183
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:15,600
don't really i don't think he's ready to travel that far i don't we're pretty exhausted we're

184
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:19,120
just gonna spend it home with a family and you get away with that for two years and pretty soon

185
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:23,760
you're building your own christmas traditions with your kid at your house now they're gonna

186
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:35,520
come visit you this step is vital you have got to instill in this child a holy fear of planes and cars

187
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:42,080
you need to ruin this kid um trans transportationally speaking you need to know how

188
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:49,360
dakota is about traveling you know if we get dakota near a plane or a cdu or any sort of

189
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:58,320
a a razor scooter if this kid walks too fast if i once told him that eagles could pick you

190
00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:04,800
up and carry you away and he won't get near birds period he won't even watch the movie planes trains

191
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:12,480
and automobiles i love that movie and you know that's my favorite movie and i can't even have

192
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:16,800
it in the house now if he sees the box on the shelf he freaks out i was gonna share that with

193
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:22,240
my son i know i have to keep it locked in a box in the basement i made a new label for it it's

194
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:31,760
called uncle buck too it's all forward in the buck averse if you think about it all john candy

195
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:39,360
movies are in the buck averse no bull crap though the the uh uh the dude in home alone is the same

196
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:43,360
guy in planes trains and automobiles right i mean he doesn't they don't explicitly say it but

197
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:50,720
ironically enough the entire movie of home alone was conceived because of the scene in uncle buck

198
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:54,800
when mcauley colton is talking to the guy through the mail slot so that was like the that was the

199
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:59,840
genesis of of home alone so you can make the argument that that is in the buck averse and

200
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:04,640
maybe there was that alternate ending to uncle buck where he they're like what are you gonna do

201
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:10,000
now uncle buck he was like i don't know i've been thinking about training for the olympics fast

202
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:18,560
forward fast forward to fast sledding to make a story to go sleds but then they change the title

203
00:20:18,560 --> 00:20:25,600
of that in theaters to air buddy to air buds sled but snow snow buddies snow snow buddies snow buds

204
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:29,760
snow business just joking just just josh around the ice with my friends who are dogs

205
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:38,240
the whole title of the movie so have a kid griffin yoni yahoos have a kid on us you know i'm reading

206
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:42,800
these and i don't think they're going to be good for our for the tone of this show yeah about this

207
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:46,880
one uh this one was sent by steve lewis thank you steve lewis it's by yahoo answers your question

208
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:53,440
mark who asks what would happen if you were to drink the water that was from where frosty snowman

209
00:20:53,440 --> 00:21:06,720
melted oh no what no don't don't dodge the question you too um oh no justin are you still

210
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:12,960
close to travis uh no can you take that fool back to magic quest i'm too far to comfort

211
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:22,000
oh no travis has a point though with this travis's tears have a great point um which is that frosty

212
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:27,920
is kind of like the most messed up of all right hollad i think because like no imagine if like

213
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:36,400
rudolph the red-nosed reindeer had like had like really bad ms just like just like ready to go

214
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:40,560
you know what i mean like six to eight weeks that is what we're working with with frost even

215
00:21:40,560 --> 00:21:46,880
more troubling is the fact that frosty references it in his song now before i melt away like he knows

216
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:53,280
his impending death his his heat related death is on the way yeah and he brings it up to some

217
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:57,520
kids he brings it up instead of doing something instead of like moving to bismarck like do

218
00:21:57,520 --> 00:22:02,720
something about it or visiting his friend bismarck key put me in your cooler

219
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:08,720
frosty you still got that stand up freezing my man frosty the snowman is a great way to teach

220
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:15,360
your kids about death while still kind of dodging the question in time because he does he does die

221
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:20,160
you're just kind of counting on that your kids won't remember the next time it snows yeah like

222
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:26,400
ah crap okay it also had this combo it also dodges the question about um where babies come from

223
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:32,640
because you can just say that you just put like a magic hat on a lump of flesh a big sack of flesh

224
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:37,040
and organs and you put a magic hat on it and then it comes to life well isn't that wasn't there a

225
00:22:37,040 --> 00:22:41,200
nickelodeon show about that with the mannequin and the magic hat i see that's where babies come from

226
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:48,080
today's special that's how babies are born from mannequins i also wonder if when frosty melts

227
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:56,320
does he reconstitute is it like if you froze him and then like i that is worrisome to me is if i

228
00:22:56,320 --> 00:23:04,560
drank right the frosty frosty leavings and then he attempted to reconstitute in my body if he would

229
00:23:04,560 --> 00:23:11,600
just burst out like an alien or do you gain his his holiday power or does he do you become frosty

230
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:18,080
do you become frosty at that point and like the snowman forms around your body and consumes you

231
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:24,000
okay hey bryce you kind of sound like you sound like burl Ives what's going on in there do you

232
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:31,280
carry his spirit because then i would think there should be an alternate ending to the hit film jack

233
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:37,520
frost when his kid is just on hands and knees lapping up his dad i gotta get all of him he's

234
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:42,160
gotta i gotta carry with me what are you doing philip i'm drinking my dad drinking my dad he's

235
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:48,160
really bad at driving i got to save you michael keaton get inside me come with me michael keaton

236
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:53,600
come with me if you want to live was was jack frost the movie that michael keaton did and then

237
00:23:53,600 --> 00:24:01,280
just said i can't do movies i can't be in movies for a while my career is going to take a nap for

238
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:10,080
a bit jack frost started myself what has he done since then i'm worried about him he's still around

239
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:18,800
right i mean are you asking is he alive yes okay he's done some some one-offs you know he's been

240
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:24,560
in some things he was in a show called the company which is tv miniseries he was on that episode 30

241
00:24:24,560 --> 00:24:33,040
rock and he's i think he's in the new robocop or toy story 4 or both it's both is he happy i don't

242
00:24:33,040 --> 00:24:39,040
know when was the last time y'all wondered if uh michael keaton was happy is he safe is he has

243
00:24:39,040 --> 00:24:43,920
anybody what was the last thing you did for michael keaton other than buy jack frost on uh

244
00:24:43,920 --> 00:24:50,080
vhs and dvd and you bought it on vh you bought it on vhs first right when dvds like started becoming

245
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:54,000
a thing and you felt like such a boob you're like if only i'd waited could have gotten all

246
00:24:54,000 --> 00:25:00,000
those special features if if anyone is listening and they're near michael keaton could you check

247
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:05,280
on him for me if you're michael keaton and you're listening to this can you just drop us a line

248
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:13,600
just let us know where you are what if it's something really depressing it was like

249
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:20,000
michael keaton is the mayor of the safeway that he assistant manages oh no oh no michael keaton has

250
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:25,760
checked in at the michael keaton museum that he made i would hate to be the weird magician that

251
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:34,800
came up with the frosty stuff and then try to explain to people why i don't know what good

252
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:40,240
excuse like first up you have to open and like the first line of your explanation has to be

253
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:48,320
well not for sex listen i want to be clear on one thing this should be self-evident this thing's

254
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:54,080
made out of snow and coal there is there is no it's not a weird sex thing i was lonely

255
00:25:55,120 --> 00:26:00,240
and was i open-minded yes i was what he has to really explain ship maybe what he has to explain

256
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:08,960
away is why make this sentient living thing with the heart and soul of a kind human being

257
00:26:09,680 --> 00:26:16,720
out of the most like fleeting substance that there is i made this hat that you put on a fart

258
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:23,040
and it turns it into a person oh what was i thinking you know how sometimes you experience

259
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:29,600
a sort of a niggling fear of death can you imagine a creature that didn't even have the

260
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:34,640
respite of knowing that that day would someday come and after that the fear would stop i need

261
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:40,720
something that's perpetually obsessed with its own mortality so much so that upon meeting small

262
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:48,400
children in this winter town he mentions casually his obsession with his own fleeting lifespan

263
00:26:49,280 --> 00:26:58,720
um a rich my first shot at this was frosty the sort of homunculus i made out of wet sand right

264
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:05,680
on the edge of the beach right at about like 4 30 right before high tide came in have you ever

265
00:27:05,680 --> 00:27:13,520
noticed how from 10 a.m to 4 p.m every single day you just hear a creature screaming a sandy sandy

266
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:21,440
scream and terror that's my bad that's right mark my words just move them off the beach you say

267
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:27,120
that's not a bad idea but then the pelicans can get at them i'll workshop it but i can't promise

268
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:34,880
anything oh you know it's the pits is that that one unseasonably warm day followed by a week of

269
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:41,600
just the chilliest winter dude today i was walking around cincinnati in a t-shirt and jeans it was

270
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:48,640
like 68 degrees today and tomorrow it's gonna be like 22 i think that justin was talking about

271
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:55,600
from the viewpoint of of frosty the snowman human snowman not as as with most things i had to run

272
00:27:55,600 --> 00:28:02,560
it through a filter of how it pertained to me not as a skin-based human being it also was bad for

273
00:28:02,560 --> 00:28:10,240
me though because then you had to find a sweater later at least you didn't have to face your own

274
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:16,880
gosh darn mortality while knowing that a life of happiness is just around the corner for you

275
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:22,080
but at least a week if you think about he puts this hat on he knows like nothing it's his birthday

276
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:28,960
you know by the by the way a a top hat not even a sun hat to protect him from the rain whatsoever

277
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:34,720
and and he's just this happy-go-lucky young man and yet for some reason there's two things he knows

278
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:40,160
he knows how to love and that he will soon be dead he's learning everything else on his own

279
00:28:40,160 --> 00:28:45,920
and yet there is one inherent piece of information in his head oh by the way if it heats up above

280
00:28:45,920 --> 00:28:51,680
say about 32 i'm out of here yeah so you're basically saying he's the epitome of tim mcgroth's

281
00:28:51,680 --> 00:28:57,360
live like you were dying yes he was specifically created to know only one thing and that he didn't

282
00:28:57,360 --> 00:29:06,240
have long to go live like you were melting i told some kids in the neighborhood about how i was gonna

283
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:14,880
die i tried to try to go skydiving but i just kind of fell apart because i made a snow can't

284
00:29:15,680 --> 00:29:22,160
if a parachute whipped me back it would probably rip me in half please don't throw my chest bones

285
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:31,840
at a kid i don't think i think his bones are made of snow and then you turn those into snowballs

286
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:38,240
and he hits everybody with it right how is he ambulatory if inside his snow flesh is not a

287

289
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:58,960

290
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:04,560
just like the it was genetics kind of genetically made a half that when you put it on like that was

339
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:32,640
um uh it is a it is a diverse retailer all right all right with a variety of goods

340
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:39,360
that seem to have no discernible theme no it's a general store then you would say it's something

341
00:35:39,360 --> 00:35:46,800
of a general store uh here's an attachment you can put on a drill that it seems to be a soft

342
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:56,880
rubber tip perhaps to protect you from drilling things accidentally what happens are you jamming

343
00:35:56,880 --> 00:36:01,440
a drill and then you turn it on and you say whoops that's not i didn't mean to drill this

344
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:06,560
this chair how does how you get into this predicament in the first you trip you trip

345
00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:11,360
you get excited because you're about to drill something so you start drilling and then you fall

346
00:36:11,360 --> 00:36:18,640
or trip okay i guess i think i like everything is illuminated okay good now it all makes total sense

347
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:23,440
i'm i'm looking at one thing here and it looks like have you ever like been carrying a candle

348
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:28,240
around i thought like i just takes up a whole hand and i need two hands to do some things

349
00:36:28,240 --> 00:36:33,440
it looks like here they have a belt that you can wear that you can hold the candle on the belt

350
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:40,240
and then you have two free hands i think that's impressive i think i understand um you know

351
00:36:40,240 --> 00:36:45,520
sometimes you're uh at home you just got back from the grocery store and you pull you get out

352
00:36:45,520 --> 00:36:50,560
the kielbases that you bought at the grocery store and you think man i these sure looked

353
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:55,120
bigger at the grocery store and then you get them out and you find them unsatisfyingly small

354
00:36:55,120 --> 00:37:01,120
and you think these aren't gonna keep me these are gonna fill me up um they have a special

355
00:37:01,120 --> 00:37:06,080
i'll call it a peripheral and it is a pump and you put the kielbasa inside it and if you

356
00:37:06,080 --> 00:37:11,520
you and then all of a sudden your kielbasa the kielbasa that you bought for eating is bigger

357
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:18,560
have have you ever said something you didn't mean to someone and you think ah me and my big mouth

358

well we've got a wand for you

401
00:41:51,600 --> 00:41:58,720
it's upsetting here we go brothers that was 20 minutes that was worth it that was the best ad

402
00:41:58,720 --> 00:42:03,760
ever brothers i've been with my boyfriend for three years not once have i surprised him with

403
00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:10,640
a really good gift he always buys what he wants he's really into video games and a fan of the show

404
00:42:10,640 --> 00:42:14,320
i just don't know what to get him that he'll enjoy but also won't put me in the poor house

405
00:42:14,320 --> 00:42:21,920
can you help a lady out thanks brothers and happy candle nights boy you know uh polygon.com is running

406
00:42:21,920 --> 00:42:27,680
a great series of gift guides oh don't you cross promote listen i think that is that it is a great

407
00:42:27,680 --> 00:42:36,000
suggestion to go to polygon.com don't make bathrooms where you eat justin this by the way

408
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:40,080
this show is definitely the bathrooms you understand that right the place we eat is the

409
00:42:40,080 --> 00:42:44,640
place we work but this show is the bathrooms this show is supposed to death the bathrooms there's no

410
00:42:44,640 --> 00:42:52,080
question about that um let me ask you guys this okay is there something to be said like i envision

411
00:42:52,080 --> 00:42:57,920
it as a triangle right three different points one point is surprise one point is money spent and the

412
00:42:57,920 --> 00:43:05,600
other point is like just numerical amount of gifts and i feel like you can make up for not having one

413
00:43:05,600 --> 00:43:13,120
of the three present by having more of the other two sure sure because if you're not surprising him

414
00:43:13,120 --> 00:43:18,720
fine but i don't think you can and don't and make no mistake if you buy a gift that we recommend and

415
00:43:18,720 --> 00:43:24,560
he listens to the show you will not be surprising him right no um let me list off my top this is

416
00:43:24,560 --> 00:43:27,840
gonna make things really easy because you say he's really into video games and he's a fan of the show

417
00:43:27,840 --> 00:43:34,720
um my top three presents of all time are the sony playstation the game boy advance and the

418
00:43:34,720 --> 00:43:39,120
nintendo 64 so like just get him a new game thing just get him one of those new game things is it

419
00:43:39,120 --> 00:43:43,680
expensive yes but will he remember it forever probably not because he's not a child but

420
00:43:45,040 --> 00:43:49,440
it's too late to have that sort of impact um what i could recommend is maybe a uh

421
00:43:50,640 --> 00:43:55,200
maybe a book about video games um that's not surprising a book

422
00:43:56,480 --> 00:44:00,560
reading about video games is actually how i kind of got into my current career reading

423
00:44:00,560 --> 00:44:05,920
lennard herman's the rise and pho phoenix the rise and fall of video games i got you a book

424
00:44:08,480 --> 00:44:11,200
i wrapped it in socks to double how awful it is

425
00:44:13,440 --> 00:44:20,480
hope you like reading i got you i got you do stuff i basically got you an unpaid job

426
00:44:23,920 --> 00:44:25,200
i got you a clerkship

427
00:44:25,200 --> 00:44:33,840
um happy apprenticing um god gift giving is so hard isn't it guys

428
00:44:34,720 --> 00:44:41,120
yes it is so hard you know what's hard is was you get to be adults mostly if i want something i

429
00:44:41,120 --> 00:44:45,120
either buy it or convince myself i don't want it well it's really hard to find something i'm not

430
00:44:45,120 --> 00:44:51,840
buying that's not as common as you say justin that is a specific problem that you do right well

431
00:44:51,840 --> 00:44:57,280
that's true what i don't know a lot of other people that want a fushigi and just buy it well

432
00:44:57,280 --> 00:45:01,520
then you don't know anybody that has an amazon prime account yeah that's kind of our thing

433
00:45:03,520 --> 00:45:08,800
oops just bought a second fushigi both my wife and i wanted to buy a turntable i was told to

434
00:45:08,800 --> 00:45:12,320
not call it a record player but that's what we're using it for for some time so we can listen to

435
00:45:12,320 --> 00:45:17,600
some groovy tunes on vinyl we've been trying to cut the brick candlelight season and i'm

436
00:45:17,600 --> 00:45:23,040
rocking my brain trying to determine a good gift for my so so i keep coming back to as a turntable

437
00:45:23,040 --> 00:45:26,560
i really believe she'd be grateful to unwrap it but i can't help but hesitate because it's

438
00:45:26,560 --> 00:45:32,160
something i want just as much oh it's uh as if i'd be receiving one and a half gifts on the

439
00:45:32,160 --> 00:45:36,720
exchange that seems a bit selfish to me brothers what should i do buy something else and risk

440
00:45:36,720 --> 00:45:40,640
possible dissatisfaction or go ahead with the turntable and claim the lawn chair of the candle

441
00:45:40,640 --> 00:45:48,160
lights that's her ep list in seattle such a good question wow that's a good one yeah for sure because

442
00:45:48,160 --> 00:45:53,360
there's lots of things that teresa and i enjoy together and so when i think this would be

443
00:45:53,360 --> 00:45:59,280
something awesome for both of us it always throws in that like tinge of like yeah but

444
00:45:59,840 --> 00:46:05,280
that's not how it's supposed to work can i give you some advice yeah please give me some advice

445
00:46:05,280 --> 00:46:13,760
you you stupid idiot what about me neither of you both of you are no okay just just enjoy it

446
00:46:15,520 --> 00:46:21,600
just say you said that like the devil would say it no yeah can i say it a different way yeah okay

447
00:46:22,480 --> 00:46:30,960
and just enjoy it just enjoy the this this special it's a it's an aligning of the stars

448
00:46:30,960 --> 00:46:35,520
as you should see it as a celebration of the fact that you and your significant other like

449
00:46:35,520 --> 00:46:41,520
the same stuff you know what i mean and also you know something out of it you know what i mean

450
00:46:42,160 --> 00:46:50,640
why not do the turntable and also some records that you know she would like i i bet they'd

451
00:46:50,640 --> 00:46:55,760
probably like the same kind of music though oh yeah or you could just don't worry about getting

452
00:46:55,760 --> 00:47:05,360
her records that she likes but instead only get her records that you hate just understand that i'm

453
00:47:05,360 --> 00:47:11,200
giving something up by giving this to you right and that is my right to not listen to tom jones

454
00:47:11,200 --> 00:47:16,320
all the time on vinyl and just know that she's probably also getting you a turntable

455
00:47:16,320 --> 00:47:19,840
and you're going to end up with two turntables please please don't also

456
00:47:19,840 --> 00:47:28,240
oh god so uh might i also recommend uh a crossley turntable c r o s l e y i got one from sydney

465
00:48:15,200 --> 00:48:19,920

what you wanted um just merry christmas bryce's parents it's going to be a great one i can just

520
00:53:45,360 --> 00:53:53,120
can entice a child to follow into a sewer how good is this clown he was just so gosh darn charming

521
00:53:53,120 --> 00:54:02,800
he is no he's not he's tim curry and tim curry as we know could tim curry blessed with natural charm

522
00:54:02,800 --> 00:54:10,960
could tim curry entice any child into any space anywhere on the earth above ground or subterranean

523
00:54:10,960 --> 00:54:17,280
for any reason using any means imaginable he could have all the we use in candy in the world

524
00:54:17,280 --> 00:54:22,800
and be standing 10 feet away from the child in an open space i'm gonna make you a deal surrounded

525
00:54:22,800 --> 00:54:30,560
by we use the candy the pony and the balloons right no where's he could tim curry couldn't

526
00:54:30,560 --> 00:54:37,120
entice a child into an ice cream truck driven by a pokemon he could be surrounded by his parents

527
00:54:37,120 --> 00:54:45,760
and police officers come here you're going to love this i'm chilling in here with pikachu and charme
