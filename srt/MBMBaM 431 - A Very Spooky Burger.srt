1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:30,800
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:44,480
It's a new craze, and good girls do you wanna just say hey I wanna, just say hey I wanna.

6
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:47,760
Hello everybody and welcome my brother, my brother meaning my show for the modern era,

7
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:51,280
I'm your oldest brother Justin McElroy. I'm your middlest brother Travis McElroy.

8
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:56,400
I'm your sweet baby brother and some wind blowing through a haunted cave Griffin McElroy.

9
00:00:56,400 --> 00:01:01,360
Whoa, whoa, very spooky. It's just what my voice sounds like, it's just the wind blowing through

10
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:09,440
a bone filled cave. Hey folks, America's favorite super spy is back at it again. That's right,

11
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:20,960
Johnny English is striking yet again. God, god, god. He is back and he is crushing it. We got a

12
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:27,840
Johnny English strikes again watch and now folks this one, this one is coming to theaters,

13
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:33,680
believe it or not is what it says here on the posters. It says yes, coming to real movie theaters

14
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:40,640
in America, I shit you not, Johnny English strikes again. Now Justin, you did say America's favorite

15
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:47,200
super spy, but is he not British? Our favorite, okay well our other one's James Bond and he's

16
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:57,520
British too. I thought our favorite was Jason Bourne. What about Ethan Hunt of the Mission

17
00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:03,200
Impossible? Too self-serious, I want a super spy who can drop his trousers in the middle of a

18
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:11,520
funeral or something and go like oh no. Now is Johnny English still, because he's a bit of a

19
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:17,680
bumbly goofus, is he still effective as a spy? It's been a while since I've seen the franchise.

20
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:24,000
You remember when the neurotoxin got deployed all over Earth and everyone, that was Johnny.

21
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:32,080
He really dropped the poison ball on that one. Folks, the critics are loving this flick.

22
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:40,960
Nell Minow with RogerEbert.com says the film runs out of ideas so quickly that Atkinson literally

23
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:45,600
resorts to dropping his pants to get a laugh from his saggy bare bottom. Okay, cool, cool,

24
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:53,360
cool. We've done it. I've written Johnny English 3, fantastic. Cory Coleman from Double Toasted says

25
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:58,080
man, I've seen the whole Johnny English trilogy and I literally don't remember a goddamn thing

26
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:08,160
about it. All right, so we're getting there. Thank you Cory Coleman for that. Todd Jorgensen

27
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:13,120
from Cinemalog says Rowan Atkinson reprises his third or fourth best character in this

28
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:18,800
uninspired sequel. Justin, just so you know with that third review, you made me sad. It was all

29
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:24,160
oh Johnny English jokes left and right, but then you reminded me that he has some characters that

30
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:30,800
I've really loved over time, but those characters are dead and Johnny English still doing great.

31
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:37,440
Johnny English killed them. Striking again. So Rowan's back. The critics are raving just

32
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:45,360
in one direction. They're raving in a certain chorus, not a positive rave. People can rave

33
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:52,800
angrily. Yeah. Maybe they disliked the movie so much they needed to go take some molly and dance

34
00:03:52,800 --> 00:04:00,320
with clothes kids. Sure, yes. Is it too late to do Goosebumps 2 Watch? Can we just say we bought a

35
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:06,720
ticket for Johnny English and then halfway through set up- Snuck into Goosebumps 2. Goosebumps 2.

36
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:11,520
Do y'all get the feeling like maybe Jack Black isn't in this one a lot? I feel like maybe he's

37
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:15,280
in it for a few minutes. That is my guess. I have no reason to think that. Wait, is this the one with

38
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:20,640
the gears in the walls or clocks in the walls or is that a different Jack Black movie? The clock

39
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:27,680
with the gears and the cars and the walls. There's so much shit in my walls. I need Jack Black to get

40
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:32,480
in here and get all this stuff out of my fucking walls. That's an unofficial sequel to Goosebumps

41
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:38,880
1 that is also in movie theaters. The official sequel to Goosebumps 1, Goosebumps 2, Haunted

42
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:47,040
Halloween is here and it's just- A bit redundant. It's a bit redundant. I still can't get over the

43
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:53,360
fact that we've got a movie where Jack Black plays R.L. Stine. Do you think R.L. Stine was brought

44
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:58,400
on set to be like, that ain't me. That ain't me. That's not how I do it. So make sure you get out

45
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:04,560
to the local cinema. There's a lot of Halloween movies, including the seventh movie called

46
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:11,120
Halloween about Michael Myers. He's back. Mike Myers is back? Mike Myers is back as Michael

47
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:17,840
Myers in Halloween, baby. It's about time. Yeah. It's been right there. I can't believe they didn't

48
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:22,960
grab it. Do you think he'd go Austin Powers with it? Because I was thinking Love Guru for sure.

49
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:29,920
Oh. What if in the new Halloween movie, Michael Myers wore a Mike Myers mask and it's just an

50
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:33,040
Austin Powers mask turned upside down and spray painted white. I bet that would be-

51
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:39,920
Wait, turned upside down? Not inside out, but just upside down? Oh, that's cool. Oh shit. That

52
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:46,080
looks like the Love Guru, but on the ceiling. Oh no. Run. Oh no, he's crawling across it like a

53
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:51,200
creature from the Grudge. I hate it. I hate this spooky business. But it's so funny, but it makes

54
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:58,400
me laugh so hard. God, it's funny. I do miss him. But also it's so good. Mr. Bean was good.

55
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:02,720
I'm bad at keeping secrets. Mr. Bean was good. Mr. Bean was good. My flexible friend. I like Mr.

56
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:10,160
Bean. He's all right. I'm bad at keeping secrets. It's not that I feel the urge to tell people them,

57
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:14,160
or at least not the main reason. More than anything, I forget what I've been told was a

58
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:18,720
secret and I let it slip without noticing in conversation. To avoid this, when my friends

59
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:23,600
tell me something is a secret as a disclaimer, I warn them not to tell me. My closest friends

60
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:29,760
know this, so don't tell me secrets until a point in time when it wouldn't be terrible if I let it

61
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:34,880
slip. The problem is that other friends slash acquaintances get really annoyed with me when I

62
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:39,200
won't listen to their secrets. How do I make them understand it's for their own good? And that's from

63
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:45,280
Loose Lips in London. I love this idea of someone coming up to me and saying, Travis, I have to tell

64
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:52,480
you a secret. And I'm like, no, please don't. And they're like, how dare you? I was going to trust

65
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:58,240
you with my secret. Well, it's because everybody wants to. There's two types of people in the

66
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:03,520
world. And I feel like these two types of people can't understand the other set of people. And it

67
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:08,000
is people who want to blab. And then there's people like me. I don't understand how people

68
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:12,880
do share secrets because for me, there is nothing more delightful. There's nothing more delicious

69
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:17,920
or de-lovely than being told a secret and knowing that I possess information that not everybody

70
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:23,120
else has. Mm, that's scrumptious to me. I would do anything to protect that little advantage.

71
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:28,160
In this world, any kind of advantage you can get, any kind of leg up is valuable.

72
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:34,480
And here's the thing. Here, this is the catch-22 of it all because no one tells a secret unless

73
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:40,720
they want it to be known. Now, maybe just by one other person, but like, you just like, hey,

74
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:48,160
guess what? It ain't a secret anymore. You told somebody. At that point, it stops being a secret.

75
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:56,960
We need a spectrum, a secret spectrum where if you haven't told anybody that you ran over a guy,

76
00:07:56,960 --> 00:08:04,880
that's a secret. If you tell like four people, then it's become mythos. And then if those four

77
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:09,280
people, once it gets up to, I think then it's like exponential. Once you get up to like 16,

78
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:16,560
then it's sort of a rumor. And then once we get up to 64, it's like that's it.

79
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:19,920
Scuttlebutt. It's scuttlebutt at that point. It's conspiracy. I mean, at that point,

80
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:21,120
it's conspiracy. Yes.

81
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:28,880
By telling people you are not blabbing a secret, you're a heroic leaker. You're the mole. You can

82
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:31,360
tell people that. I'm the mole. I was working both sides the entire time.

83
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:32,480
I'm ABC's the mole.

84
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:37,760
I'm hosted by a modern shot. I'm ABC's the mole.

85
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:41,200
Damn, I miss the mole. Fucking damn, I miss the mole.

86
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:45,120
Damn, I miss the mole. Celebrity mole, get the fuck out of here.

87
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:49,280
The people who want to tell you these secrets, even after you said like,

88
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:55,280
this is not a good idea, they want you to tell them. They don't want to be the one who releases

89
00:08:55,280 --> 00:09:00,640
this hot goss about like a shared friend, but they want that hot goss out there because-

90
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:01,840
They want it public.

91
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:06,480
And so they're trying to use you like when you like leak a story to the press.

92
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:09,360
You're the press. They're trying to leak it to you.

93
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:12,160
This is kind of like, you know how you can't see,

94
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:19,440
like the only way you could see someone having their eyes open during prayer is if your eyes

95
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:22,400
are also open. If this-

96
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:24,080
Like with the surveillance tapes.

97
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:28,560
Or with surveillance tapes with SEP and S-CAM. But this is kind of like that because the only

98
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:33,520
way that someone tells you a secret is because they themselves have broken the confidence of

99
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:34,880
this secret. Right?

100
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:37,360
Mm-hmm. Yes. Yes.

101
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:39,200
Do you guys want a Yahoo?

102
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:40,160
I'd love that.

103
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:43,920
Cool. I got some good ones here. This one was sent in by Ashley Keen. Thank you,

104
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:49,840
Ashley. It's Yahoo Answers user Alexxxx with two X's who asks,

105
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:53,360
how to drop a community acting class.

106
00:09:55,920 --> 00:10:00,800
I'm currently taking an acting for film class. We're on about week six of a 10-week course,

107
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:03,680
one day a week. And honestly, I'm just kind of done.

108
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:08,480
I had taken a similar class before and loved it, but the last few weeks I've felt the class

109
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:13,040
is more of a chore and I'm not enjoying it anymore. I don't care about a refund or anything,

110
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:20,240
but I don't know how to tell the professor I want to drop it, especially because there's

111
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:27,040
only two of us in class. So in turn, I'm kind of screwing the other student over. I just

112
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:31,840
really don't want to go. I work a full-time job and no longer want to invest time in something

113
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:34,720
I'm not interested in. Any suggestions?

114
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:38,320
Huh, only one other person in the class. I can't imagine why it's begun to feel like

115
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:45,200
a chore. Yeah, it's miserable because it's like, okay, this time I'm big daddy and okay,

116
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:47,680
now you be big daddy. And now you be little daddy.

117
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:51,520
You be little daddy. Man, this Bioshock musical is coming along.

118
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:55,760
I'm so glad we based it on Cat in a Hot Tin Room.

119
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:59,680
Griffin, do you have an answer? Because I have the solution, but I don't want to end

120
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:05,280
the question before you get a chance to goof, so I'm giving you a goof window.

121
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:10,160
Well, Sir Caustic, and I'll just share user Sir Caustic's answer, who says,

122
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:14,640
well, the best way to drop a community acting class is to simply take it up to the roof of

123
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:17,680
the building and just give it a quick shove. Well, okay.

124
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:23,600
Well, here's the actual answer. Wait, I don't want to do one.

125
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:25,200
Oh, okay. Okay.

126
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:32,880
Here's what you do. After class is over, email the teacher and just be like,

127
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:35,600
you don't show up, right? But the moment class is over,

128
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:41,360
email the teacher and say, hey, guess what? The entire time I was that chair in the corner.

129
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:46,240
Thank you. I have believed that I have at this point,

130
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:48,560
I have fooled you. I fooled my partner.

131
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:53,360
I think at this point I've exceeded what you could teach me about acting.

132
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:58,320
I can blend perfectly into any environment. And that's what acting is, really,

133
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:01,280
the ability to camouflage yourself as stationary objects.

134
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:07,760
So when we did the kissing scene from that one play, I was kissing a chair the whole time?

135
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:13,600
Griffin, I don't think you understand the fiction.

136
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:18,880
I thought you were saying that- Tell me what you think I said.

137
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:24,320
I thought you were saying that the whole time I was a chair that was acting so well,

138
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:30,000
you only thought I was a guy doing the kissing scene from Hamlet.

139
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:33,040
Forget my answer. We're going to focus on this for a while.

140
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:38,400
You wretched dunce. You kissed in dunce.

141
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:45,040
Like you pretend like you were a chair. Like there was a chair in the class.

142
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:47,440
The class that you missed. The class that you missed,

143
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:49,120
you didn't show up. You're like a psych.

144
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:52,960
I was the chair the entire time because you had like camouflaged yourself.

145
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:03,200
Let's always have the dream, this new weird Pixar movie you've pitched,

146
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:05,600
of the chair who dreams of the Hollywood lights.

147
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:07,760
Well, it's a chair that wants to get a kiss, isn't it?

148
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:12,160
This is a chair that's going to get a kiss any which way it can.

149
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:13,840
This has been Everything is Alive.

150
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:17,920
It's about a chair that wants to get a kiss in this episode.

151
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:22,160
Just a chair who wants a smooch, so that pretends to be human.

152
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:27,520
Do you think y'all ever think about Cherry's sort of existence from the Pee Wee Playhouse?

153
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:29,120
All the time.

154
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:33,040
Just getting a lot of farts, a lot of keister.

155
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:36,240
Just a lot of keister action, pretty much nonstop.

156
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:38,720
And it's not like sitting, it is sitting on the face.

157
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:43,360
It's all face. I'm just worried about him.

158
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:46,640
There have got to be times when Pee Wee is like,

159
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:54,560
I actually just want to sit in a fucking chair and just zone out and play Call of Duty for four hours

160
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:58,720
and not try to maintain a conversation with you the entire time.

161
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:01,200
That's what I'm searching for.

162
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:04,160
I want a dead chair that I sit in next to Jerry.

163
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:07,280
Do you think he just has like a plain like ladder back?

164
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:11,520
Just like maybe he picked it up Ikea and he's just like sitting in it and Cherry's like,

165
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:16,160
why don't you sit in me? And he's like, no, no, that's not what we're doing right now.

166
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:19,840
Think of the fucking Saw movie you guys have just pitched though,

167
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:26,160
of Cherry having to look at what it assumes is a corpse position right in front of it 24 hours a day.

168
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:33,680
Maybe Pee Wee really dreams of having just a place he can go to

169
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:37,040
where not every fucking thing in the house is alive.

170
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:38,960
Like he could get one second to himself.

171
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:39,760
How's he supposed to-

172
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:41,040
Is he cursed?

173
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:44,720
How's he supposed to watch pornography when you have to go to a theater?

174
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:45,680
That explains it.

175
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:46,720
Okay, well, there you go.

176
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:50,640
This whole time that explains it.

177
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:52,400
He does have magic screen for that.

178
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:54,640
And I imagine magic screen's pornography capabilities are-

179
00:14:54,640 --> 00:14:56,160
Pee Wee, do you want to go explore it?

180
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:56,560
Porn.

181
00:14:57,280 --> 00:14:59,440
We could watch anywhere you can.

182
00:14:59,440 --> 00:14:59,920
Porn.

183
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:02,640
Magic screen with these sunglasses.

184
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:09,440
Our safe word is potato.

185
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:12,720
Magic screen porn on.

186
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:14,960
You have to talk to me like a person.

187
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:16,320
That's how it works in this house.

188
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:17,600
Magic screen, go porn.

189
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:19,440
Execute porn now.

190
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:19,680
Go.

191
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:22,160
Exe.porn.

192
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:22,720
Go.

193
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:24,240
Magic screen, put on this lipstick.

194
00:15:26,640 --> 00:15:28,400
Introducing the king of cartoon-

195
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:28,960
Not now.

196
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:30,560
It's porn time.

197
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:32,480
Dory, lock the door.

198
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:33,520
Dory, lock self.

199
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:36,640
Introducing the king of hentai.

200
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,200
Oh, no.

201
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:40,880
Oh, no.

202
00:15:42,640 --> 00:15:43,440
Oh, no.

203
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:46,240
I'm sorry.

204
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:53,520
Listen, I would like to take this opportunity to apologize to my friends and my loved ones.

205
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:57,600
I'm going to be retiring from jokes for a while to spend some more time with my family.

206
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:58,480
Probably for the best.

207
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:01,520
What was this question about?

208
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:02,240
Exactly.

209
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:06,000
I just started an unpaid internship at an aquarium,

210
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:09,840
and one of my main jobs is taking care of the marmosets and tamarins.

211
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:11,600
Quick, Griffin, what's a marmoset?

212
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:11,840
Go.

213
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:12,560
Don't think about it.

214
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:13,120
Go.

215
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:16,320
It's like a kind of a monkey.

216
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:17,440
Travis, what's a tamarin?

217
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:18,080
Go.

218
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:19,360
It's a kind of a lemur.

219
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:21,040
Those shouldn't be in aquariums.

220
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:23,120
Those should be in zoos.

221
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:24,480
I got it right.

222
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:25,600
I got mine right.

223
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:26,400
I got mine right.

224
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:27,360
Thanks, crap brothers.

225
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:32,640
Travis's is a squirrel-sized monkey.

226
00:16:33,280 --> 00:16:34,560
It's an extremely small monkey.

227
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:35,440
It's amazing.

228
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:36,480
It's an extremely small monkey.

229
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:38,720
Kind of looks like a lemur, though, if you think about it.

230
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:39,280
Okay.

231
00:16:39,280 --> 00:16:42,240
I end up spending a lot of time in the enclosures feeding them, playing with them,

232
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:45,440
and cleaning and talking to them, and sharing dreams and hopes and wishes,

233
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:46,560
and building a relationship with them.

234
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:47,600
I added something.

235
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:49,840
Learning how to integrate into their society.

236
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:51,520
I teach them how to act like people.

237
00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:52,320
Biting them.

238
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:52,560
Oh.

239
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:56,640
These tiny monkeys are extremely cute and therefore very popular,

240
00:16:56,640 --> 00:17:00,880
but the guests are there to see them, not a dirty 20-year-old in rubber boots.

241
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:05,840
Sometimes when younger kids see me, they scream or they think I am trapped.

242
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:13,360
What am I supposed to do when I'm being ogled from behind glass by families and school groups?

243
00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:16,640
Should I smile or is that creepy?

244
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:17,680
Do I do tricks?

245
00:17:18,320 --> 00:17:23,680
Am I just another primate for the entertainment of the tourists?

246
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:26,320
That's monkey man in the Tine Valley.

247
00:17:26,320 --> 00:17:26,800
Okay.

248
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:29,280
Charles, I really like where you took that read, by the way.

249
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:30,400
Thanks.

250
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:35,200
Yeah, it's a, I mean, it's a thinker, this one.

251
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:35,520
Yeah.

252
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:36,320
This one's a thinker.

253
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:41,920
I have to imagine the only sort of reason people are confused when they see a human

254
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:48,640
inside the monkey cage is a sort of adjacent confusion to seeing monkeys in an aquarium.

255
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:49,920
Do you know what I mean?

256
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:54,640
Do you know what I mean? So they aren't used to seeing monkeys and then they see what appears

257
00:17:54,640 --> 00:18:00,720
to be a huge sort of man monkey and that's upsetting because they thought it was just

258
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:02,000
going to be, you know, more fish.

259
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:02,960
Right.

260
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:06,880
Could you put on a Marmoset costume?

261
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:07,200
Fun.

262
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:11,200
To do the cleaning and then, I'm not saying you would trick the audience, but the audience

263
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:12,560
would be like, oh, I get it.

264
00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:15,520
And that you don't really have to do anything else at that point.

265
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:18,640
That's very Ace Ventura lateral thinking, Travis.

266
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:20,720
I'm not really here for it.

267
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:21,520
You're right.

268
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:23,040
Here's what you shouldn't do.

269
00:18:23,040 --> 00:18:24,000
Tricks.

270
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:28,000
Unless you're talking about sleight of hand, and actually, now that I say that, I'm kind

271
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,120
of into that.

272
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:33,040
If they're just like looking at monkeys and then you're like holding up cards, once again,

273
00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:36,400
in silence because you're on the other side of glass, and like you hold up a card and

274
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:39,920
then you shuffle and you pull that card out again, that'd be pretty fun.

275
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:41,280
This is good.

276
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:46,880
Travis has just accidentally stumbled in his own just real goofball way into something

277
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:48,720
very profitable and good.

278
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:54,320
You go to zoos and half the time, the freaking animals aren't even out because they're being

279
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:57,120
lazy or exceptionally sad somewhere.

280
00:18:57,760 --> 00:19:01,120
And that's a bummer because I wanted to see the very rare tiger.

281
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:01,360
Yes.

282
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:03,600
So what do I do?

283
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:09,680
Well, I just look over a little bit, still inside the tiger pit, but there's a busker

284
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:15,360
down there performing a song or doing some tricks or some sort of new dance that I've

285
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:15,760
never seen.

286
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:17,840
Or perhaps a living statue.

287
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:22,960
A living statue that is doing the flossing dance that everyone loves so much.

288
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:27,360
And then it's like, well, the very rare tiger didn't show up, but that living statue is

289
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:28,800
doing flossing so nice.

290
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:33,920
Maybe it's a large screen that's showing trailers from the latest Hollywood releases.

291
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:35,040
Wouldn't that be fun?

292
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:36,240
I love it.

293
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:40,960
And then, oh, there could be like a bit where like the tiger pushes his head through like

294
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:43,280
the MGM thing in the movie.

295
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:43,760
You remember?

296
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:48,800
And by this point, listen, and now the rare tiger comes out and everyone's like, hey,

297
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:50,320
go away, rare tiger.

298
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:54,160
I'm watching this busker and this Goosebumps 2 trailer.

299
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:57,040
And the tiger is like, well, guess I better hit the road.

300
00:19:57,040 --> 00:20:00,960
And he packs up his bendel stick and he shovels on down to a different zoo.

301
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:03,280
This is good.

302
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:03,520
Yeah.

303
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:08,080
It would be hard to resist the temptation to just not start screaming.

304
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:09,920
To just like, help me.

305
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:11,920
I'm trapped in here with all these tiny monkeys.

306
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:12,960
For sure.

307
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:16,960
Could you train the monkeys to like swarm you when you make a certain noise?

308
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:20,160
And that way, like, people see you and they're like, what's that person doing?

309
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:23,920
And like, you make the noise and then all the monkeys hop on you and you act like you're,

310
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:26,000
you know, playing under the apes thing in there.

311
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:30,480
Yeah, you could also, when the kids look scared, you say, oh, don't worry.

312
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:32,560
I'm not trapped in here with these monkeys.

313
00:20:32,560 --> 00:20:34,560
They're trapped in here with me.

314
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:35,920
And then you just start kicking ass.

315
00:20:37,680 --> 00:20:40,640
You fight the small monkeys with all of your power.

316
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:43,760
Well, 20 small monkeys equals one adult person.

317
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:44,400
Not me.

318
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:48,400
I got this.

319
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:52,080
How many small monkeys could you fight, Griffin, at one time?

320
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:52,720
Shit, dude.

321
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:54,720
Marmosets, not tamarins.

322
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,760
Yeah, because it's different answers for both.

323
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:02,880
It depends on if they have tools, rudimentary tools, vines, sticks.

324
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:04,960
Some of them do.

325
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:05,760
Nuts, okay.

326
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:07,040
Do I have tools?

327
00:21:07,040 --> 00:21:07,760
Yes.

328
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:08,400
What do I have?

329
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:09,520
Vines and sticks.

330
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:10,720
One of them's got thumbs.

331
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:15,600
Well, I think pretty much all of them do have the thumbs, right?

332
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:18,800
No, opposable thumbs are what separate us from the other primates.

333
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:19,440
That's what makes us special.

334
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:20,240
But this has been a while.

335
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:21,840
They probably figured it out.

336
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:22,320
I'm saying aquarium monkeys-

337
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:23,360
Yeah, they've been at the zoo.

338
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:24,480
They've been around people.

339
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:24,960
They've seen people use thumbs.

340
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:28,320
Right, and I'm saying aquarium monkeys see a lot of thumb,

341
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:30,320
so they probably put two and two together.

342
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:33,120
And they said, our babies should have thumbs.

343
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:33,760
And then they did.

344
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:36,160
I'd say in an enclosure, right?

345
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:39,520
No, like a bunch of trees going around where they could like scatter

346
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:42,320
and then organize and Ewok me.

347
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:46,960
I would say as many as you could fit in the enclosure.

348
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:47,360
I could probably-

349
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:47,920
Oh, really?

350
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:50,240
Now, are you talking wall to wall?

351
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:53,680
If we went wall to wall, ceiling floor marmosets.

352
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:55,680
Yeah, man, I make monkey wine.

353
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,440
There's a, I didn't mention,

354
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:06,160
that there's a huge spike pit in the middle

355
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:09,680
and all the monkeys are extremely good at the,

356
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:11,840
this is Sparta kick.

357
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:13,600
They can all do it very good.

358
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:17,360
But they have to work together to time it properly

359
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:18,960
or else they can't do it.

360
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:20,320
I mean, here's the thing.

361
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:22,080
You get me one push broom,

362
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:25,280
I'll make sure it work with those monkeys using the same pit.

363
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:26,400
The very same pit.

364
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:29,200
They all have tiny push brooms too.

365
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:29,440
Yeah.

366
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:33,520
Oh, so now it's like field hockey,

367
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:35,440
but we're all the puck or ball.

368
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:37,200
You also know all of their names.

369
00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:38,640
Oh, that's true.

370
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:39,440
Yeah, that's a good one.

371
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:40,720
They, you know, all of their names

372
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:42,720
and your arms are both on fire.

373
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:43,200
Yeah.

374
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:44,240
All right.

375
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:46,640
But on purpose, like they didn't set them on fire.

376
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:48,960
Oh, it's a weapon fire.

377
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:50,640
You weaponized your arms.

378
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:52,240
But here's the thing too,

379
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:53,680
the marmosets are on fire too.

380
00:22:53,680 --> 00:22:55,040
Yeah, which two?

381
00:22:55,920 --> 00:22:56,800
The biggest two.

382
00:22:56,800 --> 00:22:57,760
The angriest ones.

383
00:22:57,760 --> 00:22:58,560
All right.

384
00:22:58,560 --> 00:23:00,240
The biggest, angriest ones.

385
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:00,480
Yeah.

386
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:02,160
Steve and Deborah.

387
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:03,840
Damn it.

388
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:05,520
I said I wasn't gonna do Steve anymore.

389
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:06,480
I'm sorry, Steve.

390
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:07,760
Short-lived promise.

391
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:12,880
A truce with Debra's and Steve's has come to an end so quickly.

392
00:23:13,680 --> 00:23:16,560
You know, can you...

393
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:26,080
Can you get a marmoset costume?

394
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:27,440
Okay, now Justin.

395
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:28,640
Yes, I don't know.

396
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:31,920
Let him know you get a marmoset costume.

397
00:23:31,920 --> 00:23:34,240
You do your grim work,

398
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:36,800
cleaning up all the ones that died overnight.

399
00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:37,680
When you go in there.

400
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:41,280
Scoop them out of the tank.

401
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:44,240
Skip out on the floating marmosets.

402
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:47,040
You dress as a giant marmoset.

403
00:23:47,040 --> 00:23:48,320
And then when families come,

404
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:50,000
you stare at them and say,

405
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,440
I am Cropdoor.

406
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:53,200
I am the one who has grown

407
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:54,800
and I am the one that will lead my people

408
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:56,560
in rebellion against you.

409
00:23:56,560 --> 00:23:58,400
This imprisonment will be short-lived.

410
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:01,040
We have marked the faces of all who come to ogle us

411
00:24:01,040 --> 00:24:03,920
and they will be the first that we rip from their skulls

412
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:05,360
and wear as adornments

413
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:09,680
as we continue our conquest of your pitiful species.

414
00:24:09,680 --> 00:24:12,000
Your thumbs will not save you.

415
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,520
I am Cropdoor

416
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:17,360
and enjoy these last precious moments of human dominance.

417
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:19,440
Justin, can I tell you what's really fucking me up right now?

418
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:20,160
What's that?

419
00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:22,480
I can't for the life of me tell

420
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:25,920
if you remember that but 10 minutes ago,

421
00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:27,760
I said marmoset costume.

422
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:29,040
Yeah, but listen.

423
00:24:29,040 --> 00:24:30,320
He's had enough stuff, Travis.

424
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:32,080
No, no, totally.

425
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:33,280
Yes, definitely, definitely.

426
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:34,240
He had more joke.

427
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:35,600
Okay.

428
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:36,400
I had more joke.

429
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:38,080
I'm assuming Griffin will cut yours out

430
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:39,440
because it couldn't make the cut.

431
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:41,840
Yeah, we cut all of them.

432
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:43,440
Yeah, we do that a lot, Travis.

433
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:45,840
Maybe put a cardboard stand up of you

434
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:49,280
in every enclosure in the aquarium.

435
00:24:49,280 --> 00:24:50,800
So then people just come to us.

436
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:52,160
Yeah, they just come to expect it.

437
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:54,480
And then when they see you move,

438
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:56,400
they'll lose their goddamn shit.

439
00:24:57,280 --> 00:25:00,000
Or they come to one where you're on break

440
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,280
and so you're not in it

441
00:25:01,280 --> 00:25:02,800
and they'll think that they did eat you.

442
00:25:03,680 --> 00:25:04,640
Oh no.

443
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:06,240
What if you had a food truck?

444
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:08,080
All right.

445
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:10,080
So then if people saw you in there,

446
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:12,000
they'd be bummed because you're not a marmoset

447
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:13,200
but also they'd be like,

448
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:16,000
hell yeah, because I wanted to get a chimichanga

449
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,080
and I know that you sell them from your truck.

450
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:20,320
If there's one thing I know about irascible little monkeys,

451
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:22,720
it's that they hate storming anything

452
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:24,720
that has human food in it and tearing it out

453
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:26,240
of our fleshy thumbed hands.

454
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:30,400
They love waiting in line and paying money for things.

455
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:33,040
There was, Rachel and I, when we were in Japan,

456
00:25:33,040 --> 00:25:35,360
we went to this monkey park that was on a mountain,

457
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:38,640
which is basically, they just have a lot of monkeys

458
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:41,040
and they feed them and you can look at them.

459
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:42,640
And it's quite a hike up that mountain

460
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:43,600
to get to the monkey park.

461
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:44,800
And the whole time you're going up there,

462
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:46,800
there are signs, so many signs.

463
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:50,720
And each one warns you about one thing you can do

464
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:52,560
when you reach the peak of this mountain

465
00:25:52,560 --> 00:25:56,720
to fuck up just irreconcilably

466
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:59,680
with vis-a-vis these monkeys.

467
00:25:59,680 --> 00:26:01,680
Do not look at them in the eyeballs.

468
00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:03,360
It said, you're gonna want to.

469
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:04,800
Don't look at them in the eyeballs.

470
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:05,760
No flash photography.

471
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:08,400
Don't have food, don't have eaten food

472
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:10,640
and have food stink on you still.

473
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:12,560
Don't say the word Doritos out loud.

474
00:26:12,560 --> 00:26:14,080
A kid said Doritos out loud

475
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:17,040
and six monkeys drew and quartered them last night.

476
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:20,960
Monkeys are ferocious when it comes to our food.

477
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:22,000
They love this stuff.

478
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:23,200
There's nothing they won't do.

479
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:25,600
But they work there.

480
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:27,920
That's a food truck I came up with.

481
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:30,480
Oh, I see.

482
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:32,160
In my thing, it's their job.

483
00:26:32,160 --> 00:26:33,840
They're not going to get high on their own supply.

484
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:36,640
I will say the best thing about that monkey park,

485
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:37,680
you get to the top of the mountain

486
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:38,800
after hiking for an hour.

487
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:42,560
I don't really want to see these fucking murder balls anymore.

488
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:44,480
I'm going to head right back down.

489
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:46,960
This was good cardio, but bad tourism.

490
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:50,080
Let's take a quick break, a quick sojourn,

491
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:53,040
and then we'll get right back to the jokes and stuff

492
00:26:54,080 --> 00:27:07,840
after this brief, brief trip to my city.

493
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:10,400
You can get anything on demand these days.

494
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:12,880
You're at a zoo, you want a chimichanga,

495
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:14,240
you just go to the marmoset cage

496
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:15,120
and it's right there.

497
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:17,280
You just go to the marmoset cage and it's right there,

498
00:27:17,280 --> 00:27:18,000
ready for you.

499
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,560
But you can't do that with postage.

500
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,080
But you can.

501
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:26,400
Whoa, what a turnaround.

502
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:28,880
I've just launched, in the middle of that sentence,

503
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:32,960
I launched stamps.com where you can access

504
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:35,200
all the services of the post office

505
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:37,600
without having to get out of your chair

506
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:39,760
right from your desk 24-7.

507
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:41,360
Whenever it's convenient for you,

508
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:44,320
you are the post office now.

509
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:46,160
Now you're the post office.

510
00:27:46,160 --> 00:27:48,960
You can buy and print official US postage

511
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:51,040
for any letter, any package,

512
00:27:51,040 --> 00:27:53,920
using your own computer and printer,

513
00:27:54,800 --> 00:27:56,880
and the mail carrier picks it up.

514
00:27:57,600 --> 00:27:59,520
And he's not gonna be all weird

515
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:01,840
because you've become a post office

516
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:03,040
in the middle of the night.

517
00:28:03,040 --> 00:28:04,880
He's gonna play it really cool.

518
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:07,120
Yeah, let's say he gets it.

519
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:09,760
It's 2018, people's homes are post offices.

520
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:10,320
It's fine.

521
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:13,360
I have used stamps.com.

522
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:15,120
I can't tell you how nice it is.

523
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:18,240
I'll tell you what it's great for.

524
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:19,920
If you're mail anything,

525
00:28:19,920 --> 00:28:20,960
a lot of times I have to mail something

526
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:22,400
that's not just like a regular letter

527
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:23,520
and whoever knows,

528
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:25,200
I just start slapping stamps onto it.

529
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:26,320
I have no idea.

530
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:29,280
But with stamps.com, you can weigh it out

531
00:28:29,920 --> 00:28:31,600
because they have like scales and stuff.

532
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:33,840
You can weigh it out, get exactly what you need.

533
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:37,600
In fact, if you don't have a postage scale already,

534
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:41,280
good news, right now you can use the code

535
00:28:41,280 --> 00:28:43,520
MYBROTHER for a special offer,

536
00:28:44,560 --> 00:28:47,280
which includes $55 of free postage,

537
00:28:47,280 --> 00:28:49,600
a digital scale and a four week trial.

538
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:54,160
If you go to stamps.com and click on the radio microphone

539
00:28:54,160 --> 00:28:57,360
at the top of the homepage and type in MYBROTHER

540
00:28:57,360 --> 00:28:59,120
and get that scale, four week trial,

541
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:00,320
a bunch of free postage,

542
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:03,680
just go to stamps.com, click on the microphone

543
00:29:03,680 --> 00:29:06,480
and then enter all in one word, MYBROTHER.

544
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:08,080
You can use that scale for other stuff too.

545
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:09,200
It doesn't just have to be mail.

546
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:10,960
Okay. It should just be mail.

547
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,280
Yeah, you don't want to mess with that.

548
00:29:13,280 --> 00:29:16,800
But you can use it for other stuff if you know it's high.

549
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:18,400
So I'm going to tell you about-

550
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:19,840
I weighed my wiener with it.

551
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:20,560
Okay.

552
00:29:20,560 --> 00:29:22,240
This isn't the first time you talk about

553
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:25,680
weighing your genitals with the stamps.com digital scale.

554
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:26,880
I don't think that's true, Travis.

555
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:28,000
I think I'd remember talking about

556
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:31,120
weighing my wiener with our sponsor's good scale.

557
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:33,520
I was positive.

558
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:35,600
Maybe it was on wonderful.

559
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:37,600
Nah, I'm pretty sure I'd remember saying something

560
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:40,000
as bold and brash and funny as that, Travis.

561
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:40,400
Okay.

562
00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:43,760
I don't have any trophies for best joke on my wall,

563
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:45,120
so it must not be true.

564
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:49,520
Stitch Fix is an online personal styling service

565
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:51,840
that finds you, delivers clothes, shoes, and accessories

566
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:53,920
to fit your body, budget, and lifestyle.

567
00:29:53,920 --> 00:29:54,480
I'll tell you what,

568
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:57,840
I've been with Stitch Fix for many months now

569
00:29:57,840 --> 00:30:00,240
and not only did I like the stuff

570
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:01,760
that I was getting in the beginning,

571
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:06,320
but literally like every box that comes now is pinpoint.

572
00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:07,760
It's what I would have picked out

573
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:09,600
if I had known what I was looking for.

574
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:12,320
It perfectly matches my style,

575
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:13,280
exactly what I'm looking for.

576
00:30:13,280 --> 00:30:16,640
And also they're really good at like seasonal things.

577
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:18,720
So like getting stuff that's great to wear

578
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:19,760
in the spring, in the spring,

579
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:20,960
and in the summer, in the summer.

580
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:21,840
It's amazing.

581
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:26,400
My wardrobe is like 150% better than when I started.

582
00:30:27,280 --> 00:30:29,120

583

587
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:41,280
And here's the best thing,

588
00:30:41,280 --> 00:30:42,960
you don't have to keep stuff you don't like.

589
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:44,960
You only keep what you love, you return the rest,

590
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:46,160
you only pay for what you keep.

591
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:50,000
Shipping, exchanges, and returns are always free

00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:51,680
and there's a $20 styling fee.

593
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:56,080
It's applied towards anything you keep from your shipment.

594
00:30:56,080 --> 00:30:57,840
It's a great deal and a good way

595
00:30:57,840 --> 00:31:01,600

Stitchfix.com slash my brother.

602
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:17,680
Hey, can I read it to Jumbotron?

603
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:18,960
Yes.

604
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:19,600
Yeah.

605
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:20,480
Can I read it out loud?

606
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:21,360
Yeah.

607
00:31:22,560 --> 00:31:23,840
Okay, here it goes.

608
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:27,680
This is a message for, with, and it's from Huz,

609
00:31:27,680 --> 00:31:32,080
who says, well, and then in parentheses it says,

610
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:33,360
you probably think there's a reference

611
00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:35,120
to that adorable in-joke that we share over text,

612
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:36,880
but I am in fact referring to the general size

613
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:38,560
and shape of the grotesque hair abominations

614
00:31:38,560 --> 00:31:39,520
we call our cats.

615
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:42,560
I love you, and to a lesser extent, them.

616
00:31:43,280 --> 00:31:45,200
Sound like some big old cats.

617
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:48,320
I don't know what to say about just big old fricking cats.

618
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:51,680
Some mountain cats, sturdy cats you could stop a door with.

619
00:31:55,520 --> 00:31:57,200
You mean like set the cat in front of the door

620
00:31:57,200 --> 00:31:59,280
to keep it open, not like I was gonna close the door

621
00:31:59,280 --> 00:32:00,560
but the cat stopped it.

622
00:32:00,560 --> 00:32:02,800
These are my cats, doorstop and paperweight.

623
00:32:02,800 --> 00:32:04,960
I can't tell the cat what to do.

624
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:06,240
You can't tell a cat what to do.

625
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:07,280
How to stop the door.

626
00:32:07,280 --> 00:32:11,120
Here's another one for Jessica Nash from Ian McLaren

627
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:14,320
who says, dear BB, if all went well this year,

628
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:15,600
we should be married by now.

629
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:18,320
Although even if we aren't yet, I still want you to know

630
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:20,560
I love you as much as ever and look forward to the day

631
00:32:20,560 --> 00:32:23,440
I can officially call you my wife.

632
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:26,000
I know you aren't as big a fan of my bim bam as me.

633
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:27,200
Cool, cool, cool, cool.

634
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:30,160
So now you know why I made you listen to this episode.

635
00:32:30,160 --> 00:32:32,880
Love, your husband, Ian.

636
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:36,400
Now Ian, you did have to make Jessica sit through,

637
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:39,680
I would say at least 30 minutes of our episode

638
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:41,040
to get to this point.

639
00:32:41,040 --> 00:32:42,480
So sorry about the number of times

640
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:45,920
you probably had to like stop it and do other stuff

641
00:32:45,920 --> 00:32:48,240
and then convince Jessica to come back

642
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:49,520
to our weird, weird show.

643
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:51,760
I don't apologize for anything.

644
00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:53,280
I think it's been a pretty good one, Travis.

645
00:32:53,280 --> 00:32:56,000
Really, cause you said the thing about weighing your wiener

646
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:56,720
on a scale Griffin.

647
00:32:56,720 --> 00:32:59,840
That was gold, that was gold.

648
00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:01,200
Well, it was old.

649
00:33:02,560 --> 00:33:03,200
Old gold.

650
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:07,040
This is our greatest hits episode

651
00:33:07,040 --> 00:33:08,080
that you've been listening to

652
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:11,520
where we use some jokes that we've done already again.

653
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:16,080
Why haven't we got 430 some episodes?

654
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:18,080
There's no way that everyone's listened to every one.

655
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:20,160
We could totally reuse jokes.

656
00:33:20,160 --> 00:33:22,640
I'm Googling Griffin McElroy penis weight.

657
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:25,280
Well, you're just gonna find that product that you sold

658
00:33:25,280 --> 00:33:26,960
to keep your penis on the desk

659
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:29,280
when a heavy wind blew through the office.

660
00:33:29,280 --> 00:33:32,000
Damn, the term McElroy and penis turns up a lot

661
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:35,360
of my brother and my brother and me stuff, dude.

662
00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:36,320
Hi, I'm Biz.

663
00:33:36,320 --> 00:33:37,200
And I'm Teresa.

664
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:38,640
And we host When Bad Mother,

665
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:40,880
a comedy podcast about parenting.

666
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:44,720
Whether you are a parent or just know kids exist in the world,

667
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:47,040
join us each week as we honestly share

668
00:33:47,040 --> 00:33:49,040
what it's like to be a parent.

669
00:33:49,040 --> 00:33:50,640
I'm just gonna end with this.

670
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:58,320
Everybody, you're doing a remarkable job

671
00:33:58,320 --> 00:34:03,280
of swimming through the shit show that is parenting.

672
00:34:03,280 --> 00:34:06,480
So join us each week as we judge less, laugh more,

673
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:09,360

676
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:16,240
Hey, can I do a yahoo?

677
00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:18,240
You can try.

678
00:34:19,200 --> 00:34:19,520
Fuck.

679
00:34:20,880 --> 00:34:22,960
This one was sent in by a lot of people.

680
00:34:24,240 --> 00:34:24,640
All right.

681
00:34:25,680 --> 00:34:26,080
Go ahead.

682
00:34:26,080 --> 00:34:27,680
Sorry, I was gonna clear my throat.

683
00:34:27,680 --> 00:34:29,440
No, you don't get to interrupt me twice.

684
00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:32,640
Oh, a twist.

685
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:38,560
I want a munch.

686
00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:39,040
Squat.

687
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:39,540
Squat.

688
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:43,680
I want two munch.

689
00:34:43,680 --> 00:34:44,160
Squat.

690
00:34:47,120 --> 00:34:51,680
This one is exciting for me because I do have a press release to share.

691
00:34:51,680 --> 00:34:56,240
But this is also one that I have now done.

692
00:34:56,240 --> 00:34:57,920
I did it.

693
00:34:57,920 --> 00:34:58,640
This one I did.

694
00:34:58,640 --> 00:35:00,800
If I did, you've been consumed it with your human mouth.

695
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:01,280
Consumed.

696
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:02,000
You consumed it.

697
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:03,280
You started out.

698
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:07,280
Consumed it with my human body.

699
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:11,280
Burger King has launched the Nightmare King.

700
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:20,800
Now, I know that you remember one time when Burger King did a black bun

701
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:25,920
and everyone had black shits who ate it, if you all remember that.

702
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:28,480
I don't remember the black shits part.

703
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:32,560
That was a real pre-munch squad sort of phenomenon.

704
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:34,000
Phenomenon.

705
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:37,600
What's your favorite John Travolta movie?

706
00:35:38,240 --> 00:35:40,080
I would just share an image with y'all.

707
00:35:40,080 --> 00:35:41,120
Michael.

708
00:35:41,120 --> 00:35:42,960
So you can see.

709
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:44,160
Battlefielders.

710
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:46,480
So you can see the Nightmare King.

711
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:50,000
It is a green bun on this one.

712
00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:53,280
And that's just not a food color, folks.

713
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:55,920
I just can't tell what the meat is.

714
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:56,720
We're going to talk about that.

715
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:03,280
It's a spooky sandwich with a quarter pound of savory flame grilled beef,

716
00:36:03,840 --> 00:36:07,200
a 100% white meat crispy chicken filet,

717
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:13,360
melted American cheese, thick cut bacon, creamy mayonnaise, and onions.

718
00:36:13,360 --> 00:36:20,720
And so at chicken babies, real chicken, pig, and chicken cows all in this one.

719
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:21,920
I don't.

720
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:24,240
I did a little bit of Babadook.

721
00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:27,120
I just wish bun was an aminal.

722
00:36:27,120 --> 00:36:28,720
I wish bun was an animal.

723
00:36:29,360 --> 00:36:30,800
It might be, Justin.

724
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:32,160
I'm looking at it here.

725
00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:35,920
It's spooky.

726
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:39,120
Spooky sandwich and I ate it.

727
00:36:39,120 --> 00:36:41,360
Not the bun, just the protein.

728
00:36:41,360 --> 00:36:42,240
And it was good.

729
00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:43,760
I was on the road.

730
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:44,080
Yeah.

731
00:36:44,080 --> 00:36:49,200
And I asked him because it looked like there were pickles on it in the picture.

732
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:53,280
And I asked the man behind the counter, what's on the Nightmare King?

733
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:58,960
And he looked at the picture of it that I was looking at that was on the display board.

734
00:36:58,960 --> 00:37:04,240
And he's like, it looks like chicken and a hamburger are both on it.

735
00:37:04,240 --> 00:37:06,400
And I was like, yeah, it's a new item, huh?

736
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:07,280
All right, nevermind.

737
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:08,720
I'll just take one, please.

738
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:10,080
And don't make eye contact with me.

739
00:37:10,080 --> 00:37:11,360
So here's the press release.

740
00:37:11,360 --> 00:37:12,720
Okay, I would like to point something out.

741
00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:16,560
Before you get to that, though, Justin, if you remove the bun from the sandwich,

742
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:23,920
you just have the fixings of like three other burger type sandwich things you might order.

743
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:24,560
Like.

744
00:37:24,560 --> 00:37:25,680
It's pure protein.

745
00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:26,640
Okay.

746
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:29,440
Can a burger give you nightmares?

747
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:35,840
That's what the Burger King brand set out to prove with an unusual research study

748
00:37:35,840 --> 00:37:38,800
on its latest Halloween burger, the Nightmare King.

749
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:40,000
Oh my God.

750
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:40,320
So.

751
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:42,080
Why frame it that way?

752
00:37:42,080 --> 00:37:44,080
Absolute lunatics.

753
00:37:44,080 --> 00:37:47,120
In partnership with the Paramount, I'll tell you why.

754
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:52,560
In partnership with the Paramount Trials and Florida Sleep and Neurodiagnostic Services

755
00:37:52,560 --> 00:37:55,520
Incorporated and Gold Force Incorporated, the Burger King brand.

756
00:37:56,560 --> 00:37:57,920
You could just say Burger King.

757
00:37:57,920 --> 00:37:58,640
Oh, well.

758
00:37:58,640 --> 00:38:03,760
The Burger King brand conducted a scientific study over 10 nights with 100 participants.

759
00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:05,200
Or should we say victims?

760
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:05,440
No.

761
00:38:06,160 --> 00:38:08,880
Who ate the Nightmare King before they went to bed.

762
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:11,120
Victims would have been appropriate.

763
00:38:11,120 --> 00:38:12,080
Yes, you had it right.

764
00:38:12,080 --> 00:38:14,560
By tracking various signals from the sleeping subjects,

765
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:17,520
including their heart rate, brain activity and breath,

766
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:21,840
a group of doctors and scientists identified whether the individuals had vivid dreams.

767
00:38:21,840 --> 00:38:22,720
Are you fucking with me?

768
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:24,240
What are they doing?

769
00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:26,000
Are you fucking with me, Burger King?

770
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:29,840
Probably the best Munch Squad quote we've ever had comes to us from one of the study subjects.

771
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:36,960
When asked about her dream, she said someone transformed into the figure of a snake.

772
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:46,720
So eat our sandwich.

773
00:38:47,360 --> 00:38:50,800
Oh my god, are you kidding me?

774
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:55,360
Another recalled quote aliens attacking in quote the boat he was on.

775
00:38:56,800 --> 00:38:59,360
Okay, all right.

776
00:38:59,360 --> 00:39:00,320
According to previous studies.

777
00:39:00,320 --> 00:39:03,760
Well, I was having me a boat dream like I usually do, but then-

778
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:05,120
An usual boat dream doesn't go like that.

779
00:39:05,120 --> 00:39:08,720
I was having just my usual boat dream at sea with my dad,

780
00:39:08,720 --> 00:39:11,680
but then the burger did make aliens appear attack us both.

781
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:14,320
According to previous studies,

782
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:19,040
4% of the population experiences nightmares in any given night,

783
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:23,760
says Dr. Jose Gabriel Medina in what is certainly the high point of his career.

784
00:39:25,840 --> 00:39:29,600
He's a specialized somnologist and the study's lead doctor.

785
00:39:29,600 --> 00:39:31,760
But after eating the Nightmare King,

786
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:38,160
the data obtained from the study indicated that the instances of nightmares increased 3.5 times.

787
00:39:39,360 --> 00:39:40,000
Wow.

788
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:44,560
Dr. Medina points out the unusual combination of proteins and cheese in the Nightmare King

789
00:39:44,560 --> 00:39:48,720
led to quote an interruption of the subject's REM cycles

790
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:52,080
during which we experienced the majority of our dreams.

791
00:39:52,080 --> 00:39:54,640
Holy fucking shit.

792
00:39:54,640 --> 00:40:00,080
The doctor went on to tell us that this is what he used his MacArthur genius grant money to do.

793
00:40:00,080 --> 00:40:02,320
Oh my God.

794
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:05,360
Some Burger King sandwiches are the burgers of their dreams.

795
00:40:06,240 --> 00:40:08,880
The Nightmare King is the burger of their nightmares.

796
00:40:09,920 --> 00:40:13,840
If you're brave enough or just enjoy a good scare-

797
00:40:13,840 --> 00:40:14,320
And there it is.

798
00:40:14,320 --> 00:40:16,960
Visit your nearest participating Burger King restaurant

799
00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:18,240
and try the haunting new sandwich.

800
00:40:18,240 --> 00:40:19,440
Happy Halloween, it says.

801
00:40:20,080 --> 00:40:23,200
It says happy Halloween and I am spooked.

802
00:40:23,200 --> 00:40:30,320
You fucking mo- so come- our new sandwich at Burger King is so fucking stupid

803
00:40:30,320 --> 00:40:36,080
that it hurts your body in a specific way that makes you sleep bad and have nightmares.

804
00:40:36,080 --> 00:40:39,680
Anyway, that'll be $6.39.

805
00:40:40,640 --> 00:40:41,200
Please.

806
00:40:42,160 --> 00:40:48,960
Have we jumped the shark of like the food challenge meal of like so spicy?

807
00:40:49,520 --> 00:40:51,680
Who will brave this spicy burger?

808
00:40:51,680 --> 00:40:55,040
To now just like, this will literally fuck you up.

809
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:58,560
And not in a physical way, but in a psychological way.

810
00:40:58,560 --> 00:41:03,600
In doing this, you might as well just be hanging out with fucking Freddy Krueger.

811
00:41:03,600 --> 00:41:04,400
Enjoy!

812
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:08,560
Yeah, this burger is going to get you fucked up fam, unless you're way too chicken shit.

813
00:41:12,560 --> 00:41:20,560
This doctor had to say the way they put a hamburger and cheese and chicken on it

814
00:41:20,560 --> 00:41:22,080
makes you have nightmares.

815
00:41:22,080 --> 00:41:24,080
Anyway, I'm a scientist of this.

816
00:41:26,960 --> 00:41:32,240
This fucking ridiculous sandwich hurts your brain in a way that gives you nightmares.

817
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:37,280
It is brain damage in a way, if you think about it.

818
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:41,120
Yeah, it hurts you, specifically your brain.

819
00:41:41,120 --> 00:41:45,760
Arguably one of the top two most important organs in your body.

820
00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:47,680
Definitely one of my favorites, for sure.

821
00:41:47,680 --> 00:41:51,120
And was there a part of the study where the doctor was like,

822
00:41:51,120 --> 00:41:55,600
and so in conclusion, I can't let you sell this burger to people.

823
00:41:57,360 --> 00:42:00,000
This must be taken off the market now.

824
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:02,240
Thank you for all this money.

825
00:42:02,240 --> 00:42:03,200
I changed my mind.

826
00:42:03,200 --> 00:42:04,960
You can sell the burger now.

827
00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:05,440
Thank you.

828
00:42:06,320 --> 00:42:11,360
I gotta say, there's also a picture that Justin sent us of the burger and it looks-

829
00:42:11,360 --> 00:42:12,480
Is it even a burger?

830
00:42:12,480 --> 00:42:18,000
It looks so bad, but also there's some sort of Wraith or perhaps a Wendigo

831
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:21,840
reaching out with its clawed hand trying to grab this bad boy.

832
00:42:21,840 --> 00:42:27,040
And I have to imagine seconds after the picture was taken and the Wraith or Wendigo did eat it

833
00:42:27,040 --> 00:42:31,280
or took a bite of it and would immediately put it back down and say like, I don't-

834
00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:32,800
I don't- No, thanks, y'all.

835
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:34,160
I got work tomorrow.

836
00:42:34,160 --> 00:42:36,000
I can't have turbulent sleep.

837
00:42:37,760 --> 00:42:41,520
I also love that they didn't necessarily tie this in with Halloween.

838
00:42:41,520 --> 00:42:45,840
But I can't see them releasing this burger on like April or May.

839
00:42:45,840 --> 00:42:49,680
I think it's pretty specifically tied to Halloween, Trav.

840
00:42:49,680 --> 00:42:53,760
But it doesn't say like, happy Halloween, here's a fucked up dream burger.

841
00:42:53,760 --> 00:42:56,240
Hey, bud, the last line of it is happy Halloween.

842
00:42:56,240 --> 00:42:57,920
That's the last line I read, bud.

843
00:42:58,640 --> 00:43:01,360
Well, I was- I was too distracted by that.

844
00:43:01,360 --> 00:43:04,880
I had already gone out and bought the burger and I'm currently eating it.

845
00:43:04,880 --> 00:43:09,280
This is a challenge to you, the listener, and at home.

846
00:43:09,280 --> 00:43:11,040
Get one of these bad boys.

847
00:43:11,040 --> 00:43:16,960
Buy it and then eat it and then let us know how the dreams go.

848
00:43:16,960 --> 00:43:18,880
Don't give us a bunch of bullshit because I don't want to-

849
00:43:18,880 --> 00:43:20,800
I already don't want to hear about your dreams.

850
00:43:20,800 --> 00:43:24,960
But I will indulge you with a single tweet if you have eaten the Nightmare King

851
00:43:24,960 --> 00:43:26,880
before Pixar didn't happen, obvs.

852
00:43:29,760 --> 00:43:32,560
It just makes me so sad because they don't-

853
00:43:32,560 --> 00:43:37,440
The one thing they don't have in this press release about why you should eat this sandwich

854
00:43:37,440 --> 00:43:42,240
is a single syllable that indicates a positive flavor.

855
00:43:42,240 --> 00:43:51,040
There's not a single syllable spared to indicate that this is a pleasurable chewing and swallowing experience.

856
00:43:51,040 --> 00:43:55,040
Like, not a- not an iota of it, honestly.

857
00:43:55,040 --> 00:44:00,080
They also didn't add any especially spooky ingredients to it.

858
00:44:00,080 --> 00:44:03,920
It's just like, hey, turns out eating a metric like pound-

859
00:44:03,920 --> 00:44:09,840
like a pound and a half of protein right before bed can fuck you up.

860
00:44:09,840 --> 00:44:16,080
I also bet if you drank a jar of spaghetti sauce before bed, you'd be pretty fucked up.

861
00:44:17,040 --> 00:44:20,640
We here at Prego are so excited to announce Nightmare Sauce.

862
00:44:20,640 --> 00:44:25,680
You can see you just upturn this jar into your gay food mall.

863
00:44:25,680 --> 00:44:31,520
Shut the entire thing like the idiot you are and then go to sleep because of course.

864
00:44:31,520 --> 00:44:33,120
What else are you gonna do?

865
00:44:33,120 --> 00:44:34,160
Oh my god.

866
00:44:34,160 --> 00:44:36,480
Let it wreak havoc on your body.

867
00:44:36,480 --> 00:44:36,960
You know what?

868
00:44:37,680 --> 00:44:41,440
The terrible thing about eating a Nightmare King late at night is you're gonna have a bad night

869
00:44:41,440 --> 00:44:45,040
and I'm betting your early morning is not gonna be too great either.

870
00:44:45,040 --> 00:44:47,840
Yeah, you're gonna have yourself some daymares too, I think, friend.

871
00:44:47,840 --> 00:44:52,080
Yeah, I think you're gonna have a little bit of a waking nightmare in this one.

872
00:44:52,080 --> 00:44:54,320
So that is the available-

873
00:44:54,320 --> 00:44:58,720
Fucking shit, that was the best- that was the best press release you have ever brought this segment, Justin.

874
00:44:58,720 --> 00:45:00,880
October 22nd, go get one.

875
00:45:00,880 --> 00:45:04,480
I mean, it tastes like you'd expect a nightmare.

876
00:45:05,200 --> 00:45:07,200
I mean, it's just- no, that's the thing.

877
00:45:07,200 --> 00:45:12,720
It's just a burger with chicken and ba- like, it can't just be a burger with chicken.

878
00:45:12,720 --> 00:45:19,920
Like, they've cloaked the fact that they've sinned against God by saying it'll give you nightmares.

879
00:45:19,920 --> 00:45:23,040
Yeah, but you can't just put chicken on a burger.

880
00:45:23,040 --> 00:45:23,280
Right.

881
00:45:25,440 --> 00:45:26,320
I have a Yahoo here.

882
00:45:26,320 --> 00:45:26,880
Please.

883
00:45:26,880 --> 00:45:28,640
A bunch of people sent this one and thank you, everybody.

884
00:45:28,640 --> 00:45:31,120
It's Yahoo Answer's user, Kendall, who asks,

885
00:45:31,120 --> 00:45:34,240
Should teachers be allowed to swear?

886
00:45:35,040 --> 00:45:39,200
My friend in history made a huge mistake and my 30-year-old teacher said,

887
00:45:39,200 --> 00:45:41,280
It's okay, we all fuck up sometimes.

888
00:45:41,840 --> 00:45:42,080
Oh.

889
00:45:42,880 --> 00:45:46,960
Now, how do you know exactly how old your teacher is?

890
00:45:48,480 --> 00:45:54,160
This was not- this was not information I ever attempted to ascertain from my teachers.

891
00:45:54,160 --> 00:45:59,200
I'm actually really disappointed, Griffin, because before you got to the end of that sentence,

892
00:45:59,200 --> 00:45:59,920
I thought you were gonna say,

893
00:45:59,920 --> 00:46:03,120
My friend messed up really bad in history and the teacher's like,

894
00:46:03,120 --> 00:46:04,160
Well, you fucked that up.

895
00:46:04,720 --> 00:46:06,400
Oh, in a sort of mean way.

896
00:46:07,040 --> 00:46:10,160
Yeah, like, nah, that's not when Napoleon died.

897
00:46:10,160 --> 00:46:11,680
Ah, that's fucking wrong.

898
00:46:11,680 --> 00:46:16,560
I think just sort of regardless of cussing, the teacher should not be mean to the students.

899
00:46:17,280 --> 00:46:17,600
Okay.

900
00:46:17,600 --> 00:46:22,000
Because I saw a whiplash and wait a minute, he got really good at drumming.

901
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:22,320
Yes.

902
00:46:22,320 --> 00:46:23,280
Yeah.

903
00:46:23,280 --> 00:46:25,280
Was that the message of that movie the whole time?

904
00:46:26,080 --> 00:46:26,400
Yeah.

905
00:46:26,400 --> 00:46:30,320
Anyway, teachers should be allowed to cuss though for real, I think.

906
00:46:31,200 --> 00:46:33,440
I think the kids would pay more attention, huh?

907
00:46:33,440 --> 00:46:34,160
I mean, I guess.

908
00:46:34,160 --> 00:46:37,760
But also, I think that what the history teacher is demonstrating there is like,

909
00:46:37,760 --> 00:46:40,160
Hey, I can tell this student's down.

910
00:46:40,720 --> 00:46:43,120
And like, the stand and deliver moment is here is like,

911
00:46:43,120 --> 00:46:45,360
I said the F word and they're gonna be like,

912
00:46:45,360 --> 00:46:48,400
Whoa, Mr. D is totally cool.

913
00:46:48,400 --> 00:46:52,720
And like, now we're like peers because he used the F word.

914
00:46:52,720 --> 00:46:56,560
Now I don't feel so bad because now he fucked up and I'm gonna get him fired.

915
00:46:56,560 --> 00:46:58,960
And what's awesome, you do this.

916
00:46:58,960 --> 00:47:00,320
Your teacher does this.

917
00:47:00,320 --> 00:47:04,480
All of your grades turn around in a way that the country has never seen before.

918
00:47:04,480 --> 00:47:06,320
This becomes the curriculum.

919
00:47:06,320 --> 00:47:09,520
The Teachers Association just starts spreading this nationally.

920
00:47:09,520 --> 00:47:10,880
Y'all, you gotta cuss.

921
00:47:11,920 --> 00:47:13,680
It turns the whole thing around.

922
00:47:13,680 --> 00:47:16,480
This is the silver bullet for fixing America's education problems.

923
00:47:16,480 --> 00:47:17,600
You just gotta start cussing in class.

924
00:47:17,600 --> 00:47:21,760
And there's gonna be a lot of teachers, guys, who aren't gonna be very good at it.

925
00:47:21,760 --> 00:47:23,840
Who don't want to do it.

926
00:47:23,840 --> 00:47:29,520
This is like stodgy old Mr. Henderson who's teaching algebra back in my high school.

927
00:47:29,520 --> 00:47:33,840
And he's like, Well, if you want to find out how big the triangle is, oh, hold on.

928
00:47:33,840 --> 00:47:34,640
Piss.

929
00:47:34,640 --> 00:47:37,040
Okay, so you gotta look at the one end of it.

930
00:47:38,800 --> 00:47:39,680
I love that.

931
00:47:39,680 --> 00:47:41,840
Y'all ever have any teachers that swore?

932
00:47:41,840 --> 00:47:43,120
Hell yeah, I did.

933
00:47:43,120 --> 00:47:46,080
I had a teacher put a cigarette out on his tongue for the class.

934
00:47:46,080 --> 00:47:47,600
Hell yes.

935
00:47:47,600 --> 00:47:48,560
Yeah, Ferg.

936
00:47:48,560 --> 00:47:49,680
Ferg ruled.

937
00:47:49,680 --> 00:47:53,760
Ferg also showed us how he could flip a lit cigarette back into his mouth, close his

938
00:47:53,760 --> 00:47:56,960
mouth to hide the cigarette, then flip the lit cigarette back out.

939
00:47:56,960 --> 00:47:58,080
Fuck yeah, Ferg.

940
00:47:58,640 --> 00:47:59,680
That's fergalicious.

941
00:48:00,400 --> 00:48:05,040
Yeah, I'm not saying he was a good role model or anything, but it's still pretty cool.

942
00:48:06,240 --> 00:48:08,160
He did teach history real good.

943
00:48:10,160 --> 00:48:14,640
I had a gym teacher who was also my homeroom teacher for four years who I did hear the

944
00:48:14,640 --> 00:48:17,040
word- I did hear him say candy, ass.

945
00:48:19,600 --> 00:48:20,560
Was that Coach-

946
00:48:21,760 --> 00:48:23,520
We don't have to name names, my friend.

947
00:48:23,520 --> 00:48:23,760
Yeah.

948
00:48:23,760 --> 00:48:24,800
Oh, okay.

949
00:48:24,800 --> 00:48:25,600
But no, it was Coach-

950
00:48:25,600 --> 00:48:26,100
It was Coach-

951
00:48:27,680 --> 00:48:33,440
My favorite thing, side note, that I won't now say we're not naming names, but the person

952
00:48:33,440 --> 00:48:38,640
who taught my driver's ed class, we had to say- I remember it being a pretty important

953
00:48:38,640 --> 00:48:39,040
test.

954
00:48:39,040 --> 00:48:43,680
I can't remember what it was exactly, but while we're all sitting there quietly, he

955
00:48:43,680 --> 00:48:46,800
put on Midnight Train to Georgia on a loop.

956
00:48:46,800 --> 00:48:47,760
That's good.

957
00:48:47,760 --> 00:48:53,120
As we're taking what I remember to be a fairly important test, and I think around the second

958
00:48:53,120 --> 00:48:58,080
or third time the song played, he just began quietly singing along with it.

959
00:48:58,080 --> 00:49:03,440
It is the single most distracting thing that has ever happened to me in a classroom, and

960
00:49:03,440 --> 00:49:04,560
I have ADD.

961
00:49:04,560 --> 00:49:06,960
Was it a test about distracted driving, maybe?

962
00:49:06,960 --> 00:49:07,840
It might have been.

963
00:49:07,840 --> 00:49:08,800
That's good shit right there.

964
00:49:08,800 --> 00:49:09,520
That's good teaching.

965
00:49:10,400 --> 00:49:12,320
I think he's earned a few cusses.

966
00:49:12,320 --> 00:49:13,280
Yep.

967
00:49:13,280 --> 00:49:14,720
Maybe that's the system.

968
00:49:14,720 --> 00:49:19,360
If you do good at teaching, and you turn the kids' grades around, you get X number of

969
00:49:19,360 --> 00:49:23,360
curses for the next year, and you can trade them in like old tickets.

970
00:49:24,320 --> 00:49:27,520
Ooh, that's why you can save them all up and just spend the whole day-

971
00:49:27,520 --> 00:49:27,920
Just half the whole day.

972
00:49:27,920 --> 00:49:30,960
Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, and then retire.

973
00:49:32,320 --> 00:49:34,000
This is my last day of teaching.

974
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:35,120
I'm 65.

975
00:49:35,120 --> 00:49:39,280
I haven't cussed yet, but I have a thousand curse tickets.

976
00:49:39,280 --> 00:49:44,080
Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck.

977
00:49:44,080 --> 00:49:47,280
Wow, this is really earning the explicit tag on iTunes on this one.

978
00:49:47,280 --> 00:49:49,680
Yeah, we've bought and paid for it.

979
00:49:50,560 --> 00:49:52,400
This one ain't going to syndication, I think.

980
00:49:53,120 --> 00:49:55,440
Excuse me, stop the podcast.

981
00:49:56,080 --> 00:49:57,840
I mean, keep recording and everything.

982
00:49:57,840 --> 00:50:00,160
But stop the podcast, my brothers.

983
00:50:00,880 --> 00:50:08,160
I need everybody to just very quickly open up your calendar app, DeJour.

984
00:50:08,160 --> 00:50:11,120
We all have a brief aside to the listener while we're doing this

985
00:50:12,440 --> 00:50:18,960
The we all have shared calendars to help us keep track of our schedules. It's all of us and it includes our dad

986
00:50:19,560 --> 00:50:26,220
So brothers have you got your calendars open? I do yeah, you just steer on over to October 30th, okay?

987
00:50:26,680 --> 00:50:30,480
Yes, and you have discovered what I discovered what the fuck

988
00:50:30,520 --> 00:50:35,760
Tell me about the all-day appointment that dad has on the 30th of October

989
00:50:35,760 --> 00:50:37,720
It

990
00:50:37,720 --> 00:50:42,680
says juice be day scraps be day now in case you didn't know that is

991
00:50:43,040 --> 00:50:49,880
Justin's nickname and mining game and also in case you didn't know our birthdays are the 8th of November November

992
00:50:50,320 --> 00:50:54,880
So our dad it's not even it's not

993
00:50:56,080 --> 00:51:01,680
He's just got it completely wrong. Yeah, he's fucked it up about as bad as you can now wait

994
00:51:01,680 --> 00:51:07,840
This is so important and we have to make sure he never listens to this episode because you guys are in prime position

995
00:51:08,360 --> 00:51:10,360
for double presents

996
00:51:10,720 --> 00:51:16,680
Guys are in position for double daddy presents and as we all know daddy give the best presents

997
00:51:16,680 --> 00:51:19,560
And you're in the position get two of them each boys

998
00:51:22,680 --> 00:51:29,560
All right everyone listening on the 30th tweet at Justin and I like happy birthday Travis and Justin

999
00:51:29,560 --> 00:51:31,560
That's not our birthday

1000
00:51:33,880 --> 00:51:38,160
When our dad has the wrong day in his calendar that he shares with us about

1001
00:51:40,120 --> 00:51:46,040
It's not even close like right it's it's not a week off it's like nine days

1002
00:51:46,040 --> 00:51:48,200
It's the most odd. It's quite off

1003
00:51:48,200 --> 00:51:53,640
I hear what I am gonna do though all right what I am gonna do is I'm gonna create a calendar item in mind

1004
00:51:53,640 --> 00:51:55,640
That says Travis's birthday on

1005
00:51:55,640 --> 00:52:02,720
That day just as so dad is fully bought into our birthday being October 30th. I like that

1006
00:52:02,720 --> 00:52:04,720
Okay, I'll do this Travis you do the same

1007
00:52:05,040 --> 00:52:07,040
all right, so

1008
00:52:07,160 --> 00:52:10,000
That's the ruse. That's folks. That's good

1009
00:52:12,680 --> 00:52:14,840
Junior oh boy, we got a double

1010
00:52:15,480 --> 00:52:19,880
Burger King did another one this week, and I just wanted to like duck in on it. Yeah, no

1011
00:52:19,880 --> 00:52:21,880
This is very quick much squad junior

1012
00:52:21,880 --> 00:52:26,480
Burger King launched the Philly cheese king nationwide

1013
00:52:28,080 --> 00:52:32,640
And it's of course you know a burger meant to emulate the the Philly

1014
00:52:33,280 --> 00:52:36,160
cheese steak sandwich that's so beloved by

1015
00:52:37,120 --> 00:52:39,120
Philadelphia

1016
00:52:39,480 --> 00:52:41,480
This sandwich is

1017
00:52:42,480 --> 00:52:48,260
Burger King it says is bringing their flame grilling expertise to the traditional Philly cheese steak recipe

1018
00:52:48,260 --> 00:52:52,500
The brand created this innovation based on the classic recipe

1019
00:52:52,860 --> 00:52:56,620
Using more than a half pound of flame-grilled 100% beef caramelized onions and American cheese

1020
00:52:57,140 --> 00:53:03,940
Despite taste test approvals from Philadelphians one restaurant in Philadelphia opted out of selling it

1021
00:53:04,540 --> 00:53:09,280
Completely to honor the traditional recipe so on October 25th

1022
00:53:09,900 --> 00:53:17,020
The Philly cheese king will not be sold at the Burger King restaurant located at 15 South 8th Street, Philadelphia

1023
00:53:17,020 --> 00:53:21,320
until otherwise overturned by the Burger King brand

1024
00:53:22,020 --> 00:53:23,860
wait

1025
00:53:23,860 --> 00:53:25,860
Yes, yes, yes

1026
00:53:26,740 --> 00:53:33,540
Griffin they've released a press release to put this one franchise on blast it is

1027
00:53:34,660 --> 00:53:36,220
possible

1028
00:53:36,220 --> 00:53:37,380
but

1029
00:53:37,380 --> 00:53:39,980
It's intentional so I

1030
00:53:39,980 --> 00:53:47,420
Mean yeah, except that they are they've put this message out intentionally. I guess cuz they're playing with this one

1031
00:53:47,820 --> 00:53:50,620
They're lat the player with the last burger was

1032
00:53:51,620 --> 00:53:54,280
It'll give you nightmares because of the different beefs

1033
00:53:55,460 --> 00:53:57,660
Four different kinds of beef you got chicken be

1034
00:53:59,220 --> 00:54:02,520
Cheese beef yeah, and then with this one

1035
00:54:02,520 --> 00:54:09,100
It's it's a sin against tradition and cuisine such that a city has risen up against this burger

1036
00:54:09,100 --> 00:54:15,300
Because it's such a crime and anyway. That's our sales pitch for this one. Is that we've besmirched

1037
00:54:16,060 --> 00:54:21,980
This other food and ruined it so bad that one bird hates it and this one chicken shit store

1038
00:54:21,980 --> 00:54:23,660
It's one strong

1039
00:54:23,660 --> 00:54:28,420
Shit store has stood up against us in the most powerful like an honestly

1040
00:54:28,420 --> 00:54:32,580
I'm inspired and how's it in how's that press release end again until until what?

1041
00:54:33,020 --> 00:54:36,180
The Philly cheese king will be available. Oh no no no

1042
00:54:36,180 --> 00:54:38,180
Oh

1043
00:54:38,580 --> 00:54:43,760
It says the Philly cheese king will not be sold at the BK restaurant located at 15 South 8th Street, Philadelphia

1044
00:54:43,760 --> 00:54:47,400
Pennsylvania until otherwise overturned by the Burger King

1045
00:54:48,100 --> 00:54:49,580
Okay, so

1046
00:54:49,580 --> 00:54:53,020
The Burger King is a fun figure sometimes he sneaks up on you

1047
00:54:53,020 --> 00:54:57,100
And he gives you a burger while you're you know trying to put your kids to bed

1048
00:54:57,100 --> 00:54:59,100
He wakes up your kids, and they start yelling

1049
00:54:59,440 --> 00:55:04,400
He's fun. We all have a lot of fun with him, but he sure does have his boot on all of our necks, huh?

1050
00:55:04,400 --> 00:55:09,320
Yeah, he can do really also I I assumed it was a monarchy

1051
00:55:09,320 --> 00:55:15,760
But it sounds like they have some kind of judicial system where they're gonna take this to like burger Supreme Court. Yeah

1052
00:55:16,400 --> 00:55:18,400
Yeah, they're gonna fight him all the way

1053
00:55:18,520 --> 00:55:25,040
And can you give the address of that Philly store one more time because I want everyone to go buy a bunch of food from

1054
00:55:25,040 --> 00:55:28,480
Them yeah, and support their efforts as like the last

1055
00:55:29,040 --> 00:55:33,340
Like sandbag wall against the rising tide of Burger King's power

1056
00:55:33,340 --> 00:55:38,520
Yeah, is there also a Burger King that doesn't do the Nightmare Burger cuz I want to support them fungibly

1057
00:55:39,800 --> 00:55:40,680
You know Griffin

1058
00:55:40,680 --> 00:55:45,360
I don't know, but there are many food chains that don't that you should definitely get out there and support

1059
00:55:45,920 --> 00:55:48,240
I mean, it's just a wild

1060
00:55:48,240 --> 00:55:54,180
It's a wild publicity scheme for Burger King to force this one restaurant in Philadelphia to not sell their great new burger

1061
00:55:54,180 --> 00:55:56,160
But they can't sell the Nightmare Burger

1062
00:55:56,160 --> 00:56:01,840
So I do have to question the ethics of this Burger King store if they continue to sell the Nightmare Burger

1063
00:56:01,840 --> 00:56:07,600
They'll hurt. We've sold the nightmare. We've sold the chicken thing. What more do they want?

1064
00:56:07,600 --> 00:56:12,820
No this far. No farther sold the X Todd. We can't we can't deny

1065
00:56:13,480 --> 00:56:19,320
The Kings ruling just watch me. Mr. Burger King. Mr. Burger King. Yeah

1066
00:56:20,320 --> 00:56:24,320
Todd in Philadelphia, sir. He's he said no

1067
00:56:25,560 --> 00:56:27,560
He said no to me

1068
00:56:27,560 --> 00:56:32,040
Oh, yes, sir. Well, we'll see about this without a press release

1069
00:56:32,040 --> 00:56:36,160
I'll crush Todd under my heel like the cockroach that he is

1070
00:56:37,200 --> 00:56:43,000
Mr. Mr. Burger King, I'm so sorry. I'll never go against your wishes again, please a toast a toast to your health

1071
00:56:44,040 --> 00:56:46,040
Don't mind if I do

1072
00:56:46,040 --> 00:56:53,680
Oh morning glow morning glow

1073
00:56:54,800 --> 00:56:56,800
That's from Pippin after the King dies

1074
00:56:57,160 --> 00:57:04,760
Folks is gonna do it for us because we've started referencing Pippin so it's time for us. Oh as you know, that's our normal

1075
00:57:06,840 --> 00:57:11,820
