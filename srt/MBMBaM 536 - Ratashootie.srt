1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:30,800
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:48,080
Hello everybody, and welcome to My Brother, My Brother and Me Advice Show.

6
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:53,280
I don't want a lot this Christmas. There is just one thing I need.

7
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:59,600
I don't need a lot of presents underneath the Christmas tree.

8
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:14,960
All I want for Christmas is you.

9
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:19,440
Wow, that's fucking moist, Juice! Damn, I've heard other people make that

10
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:23,040
noise before. I've never heard anybody put that much wet on the mix.

11
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:24,560
Damn.

12
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:29,760
And listen, if you're doing a water drop sound effect, the least you can do is get it moist.

13
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:32,880
That sounded like a bucket drops from a great height of water.

14
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:36,240
Let me get one isolated in case people need a new text message noise.

15
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:42,240
Damn! Fuck! That's a fucking deep cave, dawg!

16
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:46,240
Yeah, that's a deep, deep cave. Your mouth is the fucking cave of secrets from all that.

17
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:49,520
Yeah, it's a deep cave where all my family's money comes from.

18
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:52,640
It's a deep cave that puts food on my children's backs.

19
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:55,440
Yeah, full of treasure, just like the cave of secrets from Aladdin.

20
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:57,120
Trav, did you have somewhere you wanted to go with that?

21
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:59,040
Yeah, we're ramping it up.

22
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:01,200
Oh, we on that Christmas creep?

23
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:03,120
Yeah, I'm starting it today.

24
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:06,720
Today, huh? You couldn't even give us the damn decency of waiting until,

25
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:09,200
you know, Friday morning?

26
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:13,680
Today. He's late, honestly. The Christmas season starts November 9th,

27
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:21,360
the day after Travis and Mai's birthday, because we don't want to obscure the big holiday.

28
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:28,880
But that, Justin, I would say November 9th to November 23rd, that was but preamble.

29
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:30,160
Oh, here he goes on that voice again.

30
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:31,120
Today begins the Christmas creep.

31
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:39,360
We need a fucking quarter, a swear jar for weird Dickensian sort of fancy lab Travis.

32
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:46,160
Start soaking your puddings, wrap your trinkets in tinsel and shiny paper.

33
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:49,440
Is it the riddle master that has sort of take, is Travis more of a riddle?

34
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:53,040
I'm his brother, Ebenezer Christmas.

35
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:55,760
Ebenezer Christmas, like from the great book?

36
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:57,680
Ebenezer Christmas is Wonderful Journey.

37
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:59,120
No, he's my cousin.

38
00:02:59,120 --> 00:02:59,360
Right.

39
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:05,120
Ebenezer Scrooge, he's my cousin. Ebenezer is our family name.

40
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:09,360
Right. So did you get ghosts too, or did he just tell you about his ghost and you're like,

41
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:10,720
oh, that sounds cool, Abe?

42
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:12,640
I got skeletons.

43
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:14,880
Whoa, you got Christmas skeletons?

44
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:16,560
Yeah, it was way cooler, dude.

45
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:17,760
Yeah, did they try to teach you a-

46
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:19,600
It's fucking rude.

47
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:21,040
Oh, and you cuss.

48
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:25,440
Oh yeah, fuck I do. Christmas fucking rude.

49
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:27,040
So what did these skeletons have for you?

50
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:29,120
They taught me how to skateboard.

51
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:31,280
Wow, these sound like pretty cool.

52
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,160
Hey, what year do you occupy?

53
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:36,880
I occupied 1993.

54
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:42,720
So, but you're cousins with Ebenezer Scrooge?

55
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:43,200
Correct.

56
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:46,240
I'm not sure that that works, bud.

57
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:48,080
Distant cousins.

58
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:48,800
Through time?

59
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:50,160
Yes.

60
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:51,120
Does it work?

61
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:51,920
Time cousins?

62
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:53,840
I'm not sure time cousins is the one we-

63
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:54,800
Okay, how many-

64
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:57,200
His dad married my aunt.

65
00:03:58,240 --> 00:03:59,040
Okay.

66
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:02,240
And then died a hundred years ago.

67
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:03,520
Yes.

68
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:04,640
But the aunt stayed alive.

69
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:05,600
Okay, time cousins.

70
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:06,800
Hey, how many skeletons were there?

71
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:08,000
I want to hear this story.

72
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,360
There were 16.

73
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:11,680
Wow, how long did that take?

74
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:14,640
Took a long time, if I'm being honest.

75
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:16,400
One of them taught me to ollie.

76
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:17,840
One of them taught me to kickflip.

77
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:18,240
So it was all steps.

78
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:20,320
One of them taught me to do that thing

79
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:24,400
where like you jump up and it goes on a rail

80
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:25,920
and you ride that for a while.

81
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:26,320
A grind?

82
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:26,800
I did that one.

83
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:28,240
A grind?

84
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:31,120
Yes, one of the one of the skeletons taught me to grind.

85
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:34,800
One of the skeletons taught me to do a Christ 360.

86
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:37,280
Wow, so the skeletons know about,

87
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:39,120
and this proves my theory that the skeletons

88
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:41,520
do know about Christ and his cool works.

89
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:43,280
Oh yes, absolutely.

90
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:45,840
One of them came straight from heaven,

91
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:47,680
was one of those heaven skeletons.

92
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:50,080
Heaven skeletons are like, he left me behind.

93
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:51,760
Yeah, uh-huh.

94
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:57,680
So these skeletons, was it like Bob Burnquist was one of them

95
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:58,640
and Bucky Lacek?

96
00:04:59,680 --> 00:04:59,920
Yes.

97
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:02,000
Andrew Reynolds, are these the skeletons,

98
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:07,600
or were they just sort of unnamed punk skeletons?

99
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:09,840
One of them was Tony Hawk's old skeleton.

100
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:12,880
Oh, before he got it replaced with, yeah, sure.

101
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:14,160
Right, yeah.

102
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:16,560
Yeah, if memory serves, he did a skeleton swap

103
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:19,040
with Bam Margera, but Bam's didn't quite fit.

104
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:24,000
And so it was just a bonus, a bonus, bonus bones.

105
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:24,880
Bonus bones.

106
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:25,680
Yes, correct.

107
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:27,520
All right, well, there's probably nowhere else

108
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:30,000
for this story or character to go.

109
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,520
Well, then Tony Hawk's old skeleton and I fell in love.

110
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:33,840
Okay.

111
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:35,920
Oh, okay, now I'm back in.

112
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:39,600
I was losing interest, but now I'm very much in.

113
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:43,040
We dated for three years, then we moved in together,

114
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:44,720
but that only lasted nine months.

115
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:47,120
Before we decided we'd be better off as friends

116
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:49,520
and occasional lovers.

117
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:52,000
Oh, so you still fuck.

118
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:52,640
Thank you, something for the fans.

119
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:59,440
We still fuck, but we don't live together,

120
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:01,040
we don't cohabitate anymore.

121
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:03,120
That's fine, it's 2020, nobody lives together,

122
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:06,720
but do you explain a little bit sort of like in detail

123
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:09,760
of what that looks like if this lover is-

124
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:11,680
There's one fucking skeleton, my dude,

125
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:12,880
the options are endless.

126
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:16,080
I guess it's mostly vacuous space.

127
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:17,520
I prefer kneecap.

128
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:21,760
Okay, that's actually the one that you can't.

129
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:24,320
I think you actually picked the only one that can't.

130
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:26,960
You don't know what my genitals are like.

131
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:30,880
That's true, he probably got those old English jinnies.

132
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:32,560
That's right, the original issue.

133
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:35,520
Old English jinnies, those juice,

134
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:39,600
I don't know if you know, those were a wild, wild scenario.

135
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:43,040
Anyway, this is our Christmas episode.

136
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:47,840
Not our Candle Nights episode, that one's later.

137
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:50,240
This one we're giving straight up to Christmas,

138
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:57,360
every 10 years we like to break one off for Jesus' birthday.

139
00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:01,440
Yeah, for Tiny Jesus.

140
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:02,240
Yeah, the little one.

141
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:05,520
Yeah, so do we wanna,

142
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:08,800
I feel like I shouldn't be leading the wagon,

143
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:11,360
but I feel like I am, and that's not usually my role,

144
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:14,240
so I'm gonna step on back behind the curtain and let Justin-

145
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:17,600
I recently made potato soup and shared some with my neighbor.

146
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:23,440
I put it in a large mason jar and delivered it to her.

147
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:26,320
She ate the soup, and then a few days later called to tell me

148
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:28,160
she put the jar in my mailbox.

149
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:30,480
I was heading to work and didn't check the mailbox.

150
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:32,320
And then, long story short, I didn't remember

151
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:33,840
to check the jar until two days later.

152
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:37,520
It wasn't there, but there was mail.

153
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:42,160
Did the mail carrier steal my mason jar?

154
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:44,960
And should I leave a note asking for it back?

155
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:47,280
That's from Post Perloin in Pennsylvania.

156
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,120
Wow, okay, so if you lived in Texas, this wouldn't be a thing,

157
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:54,160
because literally, if I stretch both my arms out

158
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:56,800
and spin in a 360 degree circle,

159
00:07:56,800 --> 00:08:00,880
I'm gonna knock six to seven mason jars off of surfaces

160
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:02,240
in my house.

161
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:04,960
The postal service-

162
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:07,040
Wait, where did they come from, Griffin?

163
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:09,680
Just from living in Texas.

164
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:13,440
Over here, I'm brewing some sarsaparilla pickles,

165
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:18,080
and over there, these three were for all my morning juices

166
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:20,640
that I drink and secrete.

167
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:24,560
This one over here, I just like.

168
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:26,160
This is my lucky jar.

169
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:28,480
I try to keep this one on me at all times.

170
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:31,040
And this one here has got a bug trapped under it.

171
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:33,040
Well, you can't get rid of that one,

172
00:08:33,040 --> 00:08:34,080
or the bug will be free.

173
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:35,760
I want to step outside the bit real quick

174
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:37,040
and do a quick derailment.

175
00:08:37,040 --> 00:08:39,760
This morning, a big fucking lizard got in my house.

176
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:41,200
Not one of these cute little guys where you're like,

177
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:43,280
oh, like you're walking down the stairs at night,

178
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:44,240
and you're like, oh, look at that,

179
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:45,520
it's a little tiny lizard.

180
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:48,320
This was a fucking size of my hand-ass lizard.

181
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:49,360
This is a big boy.

182
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:50,000
A real lizard?

183
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:50,480
A real lizard.

184
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:52,160
Did it have one of those angry faces,

185
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:54,320
where it's like, this is a lizard that kills things.

186
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:56,880
He didn't seem, oh no, he wasn't angry or anything like that,

187
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:59,440
but he did move fast and unpredictably,

188
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:02,240
which is the worst kind of way that a lizard can move

189
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:03,920
when I'm interfacing with it.

190
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:06,960
But I took care of it.

191
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:09,840
Tell me how.

192
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:11,840
And that's all I'm gonna say.

193
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:13,920
No, Griffin, you actually can't do that.

194
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:15,520
And that's all I'm gonna say.

195
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:16,720
When you say you took care of it,

196
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:19,280
did you mean you kind of maybe yelped a little bit

197
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:21,040
and it went somewhere and you didn't see where it went

198
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:22,800
and you're choosing to pretend like-

199
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:24,640
It's a Schrodinger's lizard at this point.

200
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:25,760
Is it in my house still?

201
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:26,960
Is it not in my house still?

202
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:27,520
I don't know.

203
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:29,200
It was there and then it scurried

204
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:30,480
and then it wasn't there anymore.

205
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:35,920
I've done that move with spiders.

206
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:39,360
Everyone in my home that isn't me is very afraid of spiders.

207
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:40,320
And they're always like,

208
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:42,480
get over here, you big burly man,

209
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:44,640
and execute this fucking bug.

210
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:46,400
And I'm like, I'm not gonna kill a spider

211
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:47,520
that's very bad.

212
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:49,360
It seems bad juju.

213
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:50,240
I don't wanna do it.

214
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:51,520
It seems like bad luck.

215
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:52,240
I don't wanna.

216
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:53,440
So I'm not gonna kill a spider.

217
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:55,520
So I'll shepherd them into a thing.

218
00:09:55,520 --> 00:09:57,520
And sometimes when you're trying the passive route

219
00:09:57,520 --> 00:10:02,960
with a spider, it's gonna get away.

220
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:04,240
But a lot of times I'll just fake,

221
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:06,560
like just pretend like, no, no, no, I got him.

222
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:07,360
I got him, I got him, I got him.

223
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:11,360
Last I saw my lizard friend,

224
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:13,040
he was close to the front door.

225
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:14,400
So I'm just gonna guess.

226
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:16,880
I do like the fake balled up paper towel.

227
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:17,920
Like, oh no, he's in here.

228
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:19,120
I gotta hurry, open the door.

229
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:20,000
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.

230
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:20,480
That's a good one.

231
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:21,360
He's definitely in here.

232
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:22,000
That's a good one.

233
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:22,800
I like that one.

234
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:24,880
So the postal service worker

235
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:25,920
probably didn't steal your mason jar.

236
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:28,480
Nobody wants an old soupy mason jar.

237
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:29,520
Really Trav?

238
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:29,920
Really?

239
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:30,960
Here's the thing though.

240
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:32,880
After the year that they've had,

241
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:35,040
you wanna put, no, no, no, no, okay.

242
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:36,960
I am not going to say they stole it.

243
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:38,240
I'm going to say they took it.

244
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:39,680
And here's why I'm going to say that.

245
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:41,280
And here's why I'm changing the wording.

246
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:42,640
Because there was a stamp on it.

247
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:44,160
Because there was a stamp on it.

248
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:46,400
No, you left it in there for three days.

249
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:47,680
A mason jar ain't small.

250
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:50,560
I don't know how big this mailbox is,

251
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:52,240
but it's definitely not big enough

252
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:54,240
that a mason jar went unnoticed

253
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:56,560
for it seems like upwards of two

254
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:58,240
to maybe two and a half days.

255
00:10:58,240 --> 00:10:59,520
So there were at least two checks,

256
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:01,360
maybe three where this mail carrier

257
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:02,720
probably by the third one said,

258
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:06,080
I guess this has to be mail.

259
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:07,120
It's gotta be mail.

260
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:08,080
It must be mail.

261
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:09,040
Why aren't they getting it?

262
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:11,680
They put this in here.

263
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:14,640
It's not like when somebody puts a two liter bottle

264
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:17,840
in their toilet to use less water.

265
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:20,320
This isn't so I put less mail in the box.

266
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:23,760
I have to take it and they took it.

267
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:25,360
Here's the thing, folks.

268
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:27,600
And I'm sorry to be the one to break this to you

269
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:28,960
if you don't know about mail law,

270
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:33,840
but the mailbox is not your house.

271
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:37,440
The mailbox is the mail carrier's house.

272
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:39,520
That's their little house, okay?

273
00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:41,200
You put letters into their house,

274
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:42,560
they take letters out because they're like,

275
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:43,760
who left letters in my house?

276
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:47,520
They'll put letters for you into their house.

277
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:49,760
It's still their house.

278
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:52,800
You don't decide to put decorations on the inside of it.

279
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:57,120
You don't try to spruce it up with various lacquers.

280
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:58,400
You can do that on the outside.

281
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:01,120
On the outside, you do whatever you want.

282
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:04,640
On the inside, they can put up a fucking poster

283
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:06,480
of Pamela Anderson from Baywatch.

284
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:07,840
They can do whatever they want.

285
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:08,400
And they will.

286
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:09,840
They can personalize it, kid it out,

287
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:12,240
put some Shaq Carpenter, a little disco ball in there.

288
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:13,840
It's not your fucking business.

289
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:14,960
That's their house.

290
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:18,160
There's not a lot of examples of this.

291
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:22,000
We don't do milk delivery people anymore.

292
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,640
I can't think of another airlock of possession

293
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:27,200
like a mailbox is where it's like,

294
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:28,960
I'm gonna put this in here.

295
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:32,560
And while it's in there, it is both mine and yours

296
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:33,920
until you remove it.

297
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:39,680
The mail carrier could store crack cocaine in the mailbox.

298
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:42,160
They could put it in there for them

299
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:45,040
and have someone else come trade it for money.

300
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:47,520
And you're like, did you do this from my mailbox?

301
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:48,560
And they'll have to crack you back.

302
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:49,840
No, no, no, no, no, no.

303
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:52,240
That's my property on the inside.

304
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:53,680
It's none of your fucking business

305
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:54,960
what I do with your mailbox.

306
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:55,920
I do whatever I want.

307
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:58,960
You're lucky I take your letters to other people.

308
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:00,560
I could just throw them in the trash.

309
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:01,840
I don't think I could do that, actually.

310
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:03,040
That would be a violation of federal law,

311
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:04,800
but it's their house.

312
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:05,600
They can do whatever they want.

313
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:07,840
And you left a big, stinky jar in there.

314
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:09,120
If you come to my house

315
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:12,240
and you leave a big, stinky potato jar on the floor,

316
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:13,680
I'm gonna throw it away.

317
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:14,800
It's my house.

318
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:17,600
Oh, that's another option is that mail called garbage

319
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:20,240
and said, hey garbage, it's me, mail.

320
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:21,120
Just wanna let you know

321
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:24,160
they hid a little bit of garbage from you

322
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:27,680
in my mail house in the box I call,

323
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:30,720
in my little dead drop that is their mailbox.

324
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:33,200
And now I'm worried that they put some of their letters

325
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:34,240
into a trash can.

326
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:37,600
If you put an unmailed letter into your garbage

327
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:41,120
and the garbage guys took it away,

328
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:44,320
there's no one who'd be like, how dare you?

329
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:48,960
That was mail, not garbage, clearly.

330
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:50,480
That's why you can't throw a toilet away.

331
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:52,880
Garbage calls plumbing.

332
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:55,280
It says, hey, they did it again.

333
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:59,680
These guys are trying to chop and screw their services.

334
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:00,480
And I don't like it.

335
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:02,000
Do you guys want Yahoo?

336
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,280
Yes, please.

337
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:05,520
I think this one's so wild

338
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:08,400
and I deliberated to not bring it,

339
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:11,440
but then I am because it is part

340
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:14,400
of what could be a new segment called,

341
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:18,640
hey Yahoo, are you guys okay?

342
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:20,880
That is a wild thing to hear you say

343
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:25,280
after 535 episodes, it's terrifying to me.

344
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:28,720
My butthole clenched hearing you say this is a wild one.

345
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:30,080
This is a wild one.

346
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:34,240
So the question, it was sent in by a couple people.

347
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:39,600
It's from a Yahoo Answers user, skatermomof5,

348
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:42,240
which absolutely fucking rips.

349
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:47,360
And skatermomof5 asks,

350
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:49,840
what do we really know about Mrs. Claus?

351
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:51,520
Huh.

352
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:54,880
Y'all, there are 33 answers on this one,

353
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:56,640
which is a lot for Yahoo.

354
00:14:58,400 --> 00:14:59,360
And they, first of all,

355
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:02,560
anytime you write the word Santa on Yahoo,

356
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:05,680
it changes the colors to make it red and green,

357
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:08,960
which seems unnecessary, like completely unnecessary.

358
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:12,480
But the answers that literally 100%

359
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:15,680
of the people who have answered this question have submitted

360
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:21,920
are absolutely fucking batshit wild outer space

361
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:27,440
fucking Gadzooks Looney Tunes out there wild man shit.

362
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:32,000
And I'm just going to break you off a few pieces.

363
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:32,560
Please.

364
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:34,320
For all the cartoons and stories and rumors,

365
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:36,080
we really don't know much about Mrs. Claus.

366
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:37,040
Rumors?

367
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:39,040
Yeah, you know, the Santa Claus rumors.

368
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:42,160
We really don't know much about Mrs. Claus.

369
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:45,840
I do know that she exists since when I talk to Santa

370
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:46,640
and I ask her how she is,

371
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:49,360
he usually says that she's well and sends her good wishes.

372
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:51,920
It's a cool way to start out.

373
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:53,120
It's a cool way to start out.

374
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:54,720
Well, I know that Santa's the center of-

375
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:55,840
Just a side note, Griffin,

376
00:15:55,840 --> 00:15:57,600
just a side note, Griffin, the way you phrase that,

377
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:59,200
the way that the person has phrased this

378
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:02,640
does make it sound like Santa might have killed Mrs. Claus

379
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:03,680
and is covering that up.

380
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:04,480
How's Mrs. Claus?

381
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:05,280
Oh, she's fine.

382
00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:06,560
She's very, very good.

383
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:08,800
She's fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, fine.

384
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:11,040
She's just, oh, she's so busy right now.

385
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:13,200
She can't come to the phone.

386
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:15,200
Boy, there sure are a lot of places

387
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:17,120
to bury somebody on the North Pole, huh?

388
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:17,440
Right.

389
00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:20,960
They would never catch him.

390
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:22,560
That's why he keeps the reindeers.

391
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:25,120
The reindeers, they'll eat whenever you feed them.

392
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:29,440
Yeah, here's another one, just literally the next one.

393
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:31,520
Well, I know that Santa's the center of my everything

394
00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:34,560
and he really does love cookies and milk and even hot cocoa.

395
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:36,480
The elves sometimes love to tease him.

396
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:38,640
As for me, I love to bake and help out in the workshop

397
00:16:38,640 --> 00:16:40,400
and my main job is cooking and cleaning

398
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:41,600
and picking up and doing laundry.

399
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:44,320
Okay, so they are interesting.

400
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:47,120
They are inhabiting Mrs. Claus in this one.

401
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:48,400
There are no quotation marks.

402
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:49,520
With all the little ones around here,

403
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:50,640
I have a full-time job too.

404
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:53,040
I must care for the animals and take them to appointments.

405
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:55,760
So the reindeers get sick?

406
00:16:55,760 --> 00:16:57,120
The reindeers get sick?

407
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:59,520
I think the little ones are the elves.

408
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:01,920
The animals get sick and I have to take them to appointments

409
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:04,960
and when the elves have soccer games or school or work,

410
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:06,080
I help them with that too.

411
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:09,680
Bedtime, Santa and I both try to do together.

412
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:11,360
Bedtime stories are a must at our house.

413
00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:13,760
We often go over the naughty and nice list together before bed

414
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:15,440
and then we read our Bible,

415
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:17,040
check in on the elves and animals.

416
00:17:17,040 --> 00:17:18,400
And we kiss each other goodnight

417
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:20,400
and I set the cocoa machine before bed

418
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:22,560
and we sleep in and in the morning.

419
00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:24,160
And then in the morning, we fuck.

420
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:28,720
And we fuck like fucking wild dogs.

421
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:30,800
I don't like this idea of Santa Claus

422
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:32,240
as a follower of Christ.

423
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:32,740
Okay.

424
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:36,800
Because for me, I don't understand a Christian who's like,

425
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:40,400
I'm gonna make this kid's birthday all about me.

426
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:40,880
Right.

427
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:42,720
Because that's what he did, you know what I mean?

428
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:44,080
I want to make this one about me.

429
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:47,280
Santa really took that one away from old Jesus, didn't he?

430
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:49,280
Yeah, he did.

431
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:51,760
I don't see Jesus on Coke cans, all right?

432
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:57,600
Just like the Energizer Bunny took over Easter.

433
00:17:57,600 --> 00:17:58,160
Yeah.

434
00:17:58,160 --> 00:17:59,600
Jesus help one out, okay?

435
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:00,320
Cadbury Bunny.

436
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:02,080
When fucking Bart Simpson took Easter

437
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:04,160
with all of his great Butterfinger commercials.

438
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:06,160
Here's another one, literally the next one.

439
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:08,720
Mrs. Claus used to be invented to assuage matters

440
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:10,080
over Santa's loneliness.

441
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:11,760
All right, all right, all right.

442
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:16,000
Children normally requested if Santa had a spouse and youngsters,

443
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:19,040
so if you shrewd creator or advertiser, determine sure.

444
00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:21,920
However, they just have the youngsters of the sector

445
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:23,840
to like and none in their possess.

446
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:27,840
So like, if I'm reading this correctly,

447
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:29,840
that Mrs. Claus was invented

448
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:31,440
because kids would come up to Santa and be like,

449
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:34,960
damn, Santa, are you getting some though, dog?

450
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:38,320
You getting some up there, up in the pole?

451
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:40,800
You getting the pole up in the pole, Santa?

452
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:44,560
Probably not.

453
00:18:44,560 --> 00:18:46,960
Originally, the answer when he got asked that was,

454
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:49,920
he would just say, I've got ho, ho, hos in different area codes.

455
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:52,160
Travis, it's funny that you say that.

456
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:53,200
Just a few more down.

457
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:56,960
I heard that she's married to a ho, ho, ho,

458
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:59,200
AKA Santa, old Saint Nick, Kris Kringle.

459
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:02,240
You're getting coal in your stocking for blabbing, M.

460
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:03,440
Shame on you.

461
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:07,040
Don't know what none of that does or means it.

462
00:19:07,040 --> 00:19:10,320
Here's one, that she is married to Santa Claus.

463
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:11,120
In, out.

464
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:13,520
Bing, bang, boom.

465
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:14,320
And we're done.

466
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:17,200
But is that the only thing you know about her?

467
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:18,320
Shame on you, sir.

468
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:19,280
Shame on you.

469
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:21,760
You didn't know this one from an anonymous user.

470
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:22,960
She sits while her husband,

471
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:24,480
Santa and his elves do all the work.

472
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:27,440
She also can't have kids unless Santa's sperm is bad.

473
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:30,480
Killer.

474
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:32,960
She is probably sitting at home getting visits

475
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:34,240
from a tiger woods.

476
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:42,480
She's the driving force behind the legend of Santa Claus.

477
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:43,680
I like that one.

478
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:44,720
I like that one too.

479
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:47,600
I like the strong woman behind the man angle.

480
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:48,400
I love that one.

481
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:50,640
She was bitten three nights ago by me.

482
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:52,880
Her name is now Mrs. Claustrophobic

483
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:55,040
because she's trapped in my cellar.

484
00:19:55,040 --> 00:19:55,760
Yahoo!

485
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:57,680
Hey, it's me, Griffin.

486
00:19:57,680 --> 00:19:59,200
Hey, I see you're trapped down there

487
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:01,200
in that big, big, deep hole.

488
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:02,400
I got a rope here.

489
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:03,440
Do you need help?

490
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:04,480
I can pull you out.

491
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:07,520
So just, I'm confused by that.

492
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:09,280
They bit Mrs. Claus

493
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:11,280
and that led her to being trapped in the basement

494
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:12,400
or is there a step in there?

495
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:15,440
They got bit and then that means they get to keep them all.

496
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:16,880
Next one, Lone Wolf.

497
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:18,640
Santa always wears a cup.

498
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:21,440
Not the question, but thank you very much.

499
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:29,680
I feel like that person pulled up a convertible like,

500
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:34,240
hey, I'd like to throw my fucking thing in here.

501
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:37,920
If we got time, Santa always wears a cup.

502
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:41,200
George, we know you mention it anytime we talk about

503
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:43,200
literally anything.

504
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:44,880
Fucking back to back.

505
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:47,520
She's all warm, rosy cheeked, joyful

506
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:48,720
with a merry laugh and sweet.

507
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:50,480
This is the only answer of these 33

508
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:53,520
that got a thumbs down reaction from somebody.

509
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:54,400
Literally next.

510
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:56,560
You're not buying into the fiction enough.

511
00:20:56,560 --> 00:20:57,520
Literally next.

512
00:20:57,520 --> 00:20:59,920
She likes to stay close to the pole.

513
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:00,420
Hussie!

514
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:01,780
Yahoo!

515
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:05,520
I wish I could put a website in timeout.

516
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:08,880
Can I fucking call, I guess, Elon?

517
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:10,000
Like, I don't want to,

518
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,240
but is there anybody who can put a website in timeout?

519
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:13,620
Santa?

520
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:15,600
That's the thing.

521
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:18,240
This is going to get back to old Chris Kringle

522
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:20,480
and he's going to be like, what did you say about my wife?

523
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:22,080
Or ultimately he's going to be like,

524
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:24,640
honey, is there something you need to tell me?

525
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:27,440
A few of the people on this said that they have

526
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:30,400
had sexual Congress with you,

527
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:33,600
which seems unlikely, but I have to inquire.

528
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:36,640
Well, Christmas is canceled this year

529
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:40,720
because me and the missus need to go do couples counseling.

530
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:43,280
She porked someone and got locked in their basement.

531
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:44,720
Missed Christmas,

532
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:47,360
and we were supposed to read the Bible tonight.

533
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:53,360
To the man who has my wife locked in his basement,

534
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:55,680
I have a particular set of skills.

535
00:21:55,680 --> 00:21:59,520
If it was five answers and all of them were this wild,

536
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:00,800
that'd be one thing.

537
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:04,320
If there were 15 answers and a couple of them were this wild,

538
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:05,600
it would be one thing.

539
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:07,120
This is 33 answers,

540
00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:10,880
which with very few exceptions are just like,

541
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:17,040
yeah, I heard her and the headless horseman fucked

542
00:22:17,040 --> 00:22:19,360
and Santa's got old jizz.

543
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:23,280
He's got broken jingle balls.

544
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:24,960
He's got broken jingle balls

545
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:29,520
and I heard that she likes to huff reindeer shit to get high.

546
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:35,600
And meanwhile, Yahoo's like, we made the words red and green.

547
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:36,720
It's festive.

548
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:40,400
Is this like a special sub-Yahoo?

549
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:41,520
I don't know if those exist,

550
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:45,440
but is there like a layer on this

551
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:50,320
where it's like sort of an RP Yahoo answers

552
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:52,400
where you can like really inhabit the world?

553
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:53,840
I do not believe so.

554
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:56,640
I think it's just the regular ass busted up fucking

555
00:22:56,640 --> 00:23:00,000
Yahoo answers website that nobody wants,

556
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,480
nobody will pay for, invest in.

557
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:04,880
This money, this website is burning money.

558
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:06,560
I do not understand how it's still out.

559
00:23:06,560 --> 00:23:10,320
I'm grateful for it because of the capital C content,

560
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:11,840
but what the fuck else?

561
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:14,400
Like we couldn't make Quibi work,

562
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:19,360
but fucking Yahoo answers is financially soluble?

563
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:24,320
Cram have moved on to other, to greener pastures.

564
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:28,160
It's an abandoned building with like Russian teens

565
00:23:28,160 --> 00:23:31,680
doing toilet cocaine in the busted up bathroom.

566
00:23:31,680 --> 00:23:33,360
It's ruined, it's gone.

567
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:34,400
It's beyond repair.

568
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:36,400
This is what is left here on Yahoo answers.

569
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:37,280
I'll buy it.

570
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:39,600
Let's fucking buy it.

571
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:41,600
This would be an incredible investment.

572
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:45,760
And what a turnaround, what a story.

573
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:48,640
If it's like, oh, do you remember how 11 years ago

574
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:53,280
we started and we included some weird, silly questions?

575
00:23:53,280 --> 00:23:56,560
Now we own those questions, we built them back.

576
00:23:56,560 --> 00:23:57,840
This is our sea biscuit.

577
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:00,720
How about another question?

578
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:02,320
Yeah, I'd love that.

579
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:03,600
Here it comes.

580
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:08,560
I work in the cheese shop of a liquor store

581
00:24:08,560 --> 00:24:10,240
and I'm pretty new to the job.

582
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:12,720
Because of this, I'll often butcher pieces of cheese

583
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:13,440
to the point where you can't sell them.

584
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:14,800
You're already doing it bad.

585
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:18,480
Yeah, you shouldn't butcher the cheese.

586
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:19,920
That's for me only.

587
00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:21,600
My manager tells me to throw them away,

588
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:23,120
but I always feel like that's such a waste.

589
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:24,960
I would love to take them home with me.

590
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:26,640
How do I casually bring this up to ask

591
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:29,040
if I could take the cheese preferably for free

592
00:24:29,040 --> 00:24:30,560
or should I just take it anyway?

593
00:24:30,560 --> 00:24:32,800
Please help, that's from please help me steal this cheese.

594
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:34,560
Ooh, that's a slippery slope.

595
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:36,320
Oh boy, that's rough.

596
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:40,160
Well, we need to, obviously, here's a joke.

597
00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:42,960
You don't butcher the cheese, you cut it to cheese

598
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:44,880
and that's very fucking funny.

599
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:48,640
But for real though, what verb are we doing?

600
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:52,320
Do we mong, do you mong, mong the cheese?

601
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:53,200
You mong or the cheese?

602
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:54,400
You mong it, mong the cheese.

603
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:56,560
Monging is selling, mongering,

604
00:24:56,560 --> 00:24:58,800
mongering is the selling of it.

605
00:24:58,800 --> 00:24:59,600
Yeah.

606
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:02,720
I believe carving is what an artist does.

607
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:04,080
Slice, slicing.

608
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:05,520
No, Justin, fuck you.

609
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:07,040
Everyone slices their cheese at home.

610
00:25:07,040 --> 00:25:07,360
Oh.

611
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:08,960
I'm carving the cheese.

612
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:10,960
I'm opening the slice of cheese.

613
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:13,120
This is artisanal.

614
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:15,280
I'm unwrapping the slice of cheese.

615
00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:15,760
No.

616
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:18,400
For the sandwich I'm making.

617
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:20,320
I'm blooming the cheese.

618
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:23,120
Today we're letting the cheese bloom.

619
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:25,360
Today I'm gonna throw this big block of cheese

620
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:27,360
up on that light bulb in my ceiling fan.

621
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:29,600
I'm gonna smush the cheese.

622
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:30,400
I'm gonna smush it.

623
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:31,680
That's what you could tell your boss.

624
00:25:31,680 --> 00:25:33,360
I didn't mess it up, I was blooming the cheese.

625
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:33,920
I was blooming it.

626
00:25:33,920 --> 00:25:35,600
Oh, you don't bloom here.

627
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:36,720
I don't bloom cheese here.

628
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:38,560
It's all the thing at the pâtisserie.

629
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:40,640
I used to work at in Farrell.

630
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:42,960
In Farrell.

631
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:48,240
Me and Farrell used to work in France at the pâtisserie.

632
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:50,800
He would chop up all of the cheese

633
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:52,800
bad into little unsellable chunks

634
00:25:52,800 --> 00:25:54,640
and we would make nachos.

635
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:58,880
His strange large hat is the main from cheese

636
00:26:00,160 --> 00:26:03,760
that I sliced, or rather butchered, myself.

637
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:04,480
Oh, you.

638
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:09,600
I go through the trouble of going to a place

639
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:11,760
that specifically sells cheese,

640
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:13,840
even if it is inside a liquor store,

641
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:17,200
you better put on a fake French accent for a reason.

642
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:17,760
That's fair.

643
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:20,240
Okay, here's the problem with this.

644
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:23,680
You accidentally cut cheese bad.

645
00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:26,480
And you're like, I could take this out, great.

646
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:32,400
But how does your boss know you accidentally cut the cheese bad

647
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:33,920
if you're like, I could just take it.

648
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:38,560
But then again, just throwing it away, is that better?

649
00:26:38,560 --> 00:26:40,960
I think you take it without a word.

650
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:44,480
You can have your cheese and eat it too here if you do.

651
00:26:45,280 --> 00:26:46,880
This is an honest mistake, right?

652
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:48,560
I believe in you.

653
00:26:48,560 --> 00:26:50,640
We don't have any stealers or sinners

654
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:52,880
or thieves who listen to our shit.

655
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:54,160
Real Mrs. Clauses.

656
00:26:54,160 --> 00:26:56,720
Real Mrs. Clauses if you know what Travis is saying.

657
00:26:58,320 --> 00:27:00,800
So you can make this work for you.

658
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:02,960
Innocent crime, let me take home the scrapple.

659
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:04,320
Don't just throw it away.

660
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:07,680
But what you do have to do to get rid of

661
00:27:07,680 --> 00:27:10,080
any appearance of impropriety

662
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:13,360
is every time you do fuck this cheese up

663
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:17,280
with your clumsy oaf hands, is you gotta go, uh-oh.

664
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:22,160
Every single time so that your boss does know

665
00:27:22,160 --> 00:27:24,640
that mistakes and whoopsies have been done.

666
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:28,960
Yeah, and I think the more it draws attention

667
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:31,280
to your mistake, the more your boss will be like,

668
00:27:31,280 --> 00:27:33,200
they are definitely not doing this on purpose

669
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:36,560
because no human being would repeat the thing

670
00:27:36,560 --> 00:27:40,800
that they're doing just for a free morsel of cheese

671
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:43,200
like some kind of Dickensian mouse.

672
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:46,320
Yeah, like fucking Monterey Jack from the Rescue Rangers.

673
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:47,360
Correct.

674
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:52,480
Now, I am now thinking about being at a cheese platter

675
00:27:53,680 --> 00:27:58,000
and looking at all of their impressive hunks

676
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:59,680
that they've got and trying to think about

677
00:27:59,680 --> 00:28:03,920
what's gonna go best for my big adult party

678
00:28:03,920 --> 00:28:05,360
I'm having that night.

679
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:07,360
And I go to the cheesemonger and I say,

680
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:09,760
I'm looking for something that's gonna pair well

681
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:12,480
with a very oaky scotch.

682
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:13,520
And I was wondering if you,

683
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:15,760
and then I hear from the back room, uh-oh.

684
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:23,040
I'm probably, I might take my business.

685
00:28:23,040 --> 00:28:24,720
I don't know what I would do in that scenario.

686
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:28,000
Yeah, but what if you're at one of the finest

687
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:32,800
fromagelies in the nation of France.

688
00:28:32,800 --> 00:28:35,360
Yes, and they said, and you hear from the back,

689
00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:37,440
that you hear, le, uh-oh.

690
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:38,640
That's, yeah.

691
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:39,440
Zut-a-lore.

692
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:41,200
Is that a letter?

693
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:42,240
Zut-a-lore.

694
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:44,880
Zut-a-lore, I fucked it up again.

695
00:28:47,680 --> 00:28:50,480
Sacre bleu, I fucked it up.

696
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:50,980
Oh.

697
00:28:52,560 --> 00:28:57,040
Sacre bleu cheese, I fucked, is all over the floor.

698
00:28:57,040 --> 00:28:58,480
Hey boss, I did it again.

699
00:28:58,480 --> 00:28:59,760
I dropped it on the floor.

700
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:01,040
Oh ratatouille.

701
00:29:01,040 --> 00:29:02,000
Really?

702
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:03,920
You told me not to cut it in my hand

703
00:29:03,920 --> 00:29:05,760
and I held it in my hand and I cut it

704
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:07,200
and I got blood on the dang thing.

705
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:09,600
That is the thing, if I hear, oh no,

706
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:14,320
in any location where cutting is 50% of the job or more,

707
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:17,520
I assume someone has just been mutilated.

708
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:19,280
A slicer cut has happened.

709
00:29:19,280 --> 00:29:22,880
Although, damn, it would be a power move though

710
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:24,880
for if the boss came back and was like,

711
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:26,640
what did you do to this cheese?

712
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:28,720
You can just be like, don't blame me,

713
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:30,320
blame my ratatouille.

714
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:31,360
And you lift up your hat.

715
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:32,640
My ratatouille did it.

716
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:34,880
And he's like, oh, you're doing a ratatouille?

717
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:36,480
And you say, yeah, sorry.

718
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:38,720
He says, no, and he lifts up his hat.

719
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:41,120
I've been doing a ratatouille too.

720
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:41,920
And then you're like, wait.

721
00:29:41,920 --> 00:29:43,360
Are we all doing ratatouilles?

722
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:45,200
But you don't actually cook anything here.

723
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:47,440
Like, yeah, my rat does business.

724
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:50,320
I have a business rat.

725
00:29:51,680 --> 00:29:53,520
He got his degree in accounting.

726
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:55,120
Hey, I'm here.

727
00:29:55,120 --> 00:29:57,760
Do you think there was a rat who heard about Remy

728
00:29:57,760 --> 00:30:01,200
and was like, hell yeah, I've always wanted to be a sniper.

729
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:02,160
An elite sniper.

730
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:04,080
Ratatouille too.

731
00:30:05,040 --> 00:30:07,120
No one told me I can't do, I'm ratatouille.

732
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:10,400
No one told me I couldn't do it.

733
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:11,760
So now I'm gonna do it.

734
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:14,240
And I don't care about critics because I shoot them

735
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:16,720
because that's my fucking bag, baby.

736
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:18,080
Oh, man.

737
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:24,400
Ratatouille is really good juice.

738
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:25,600
I just want to let you know that.

739
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:27,520
Well, thanks, let's ride on the tide

740
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:39,200
of that great joke to the money zone.

741
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:39,700
Quip.

742
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:43,120
Yeah, ratatouille I guess was a quip.

743
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:44,560
That seems a little reductive though.

744
00:30:44,560 --> 00:30:46,400
It was more kind of a statement of purpose.

745
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:47,840
Justin, you dumb piece of shit.

746
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:49,680
I'm talking about the toothbrush company.

747
00:30:51,280 --> 00:30:52,400
Not a funny joke.

748
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:54,480
Although quip could also mean a funny joke.

749
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:57,520
But what I mean is the toothbrush company

750
00:30:57,520 --> 00:30:59,920
with their new smart electric toothbrush

751
00:30:59,920 --> 00:31:02,480
and using said smart electric toothbrush,

752
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:04,960
good habits can earn you great perks,

753
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:06,320
like free products, gift cards and more.

754
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:08,320
How it works, you connect it to your phone.

755
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:10,640
You use this thing called Bluetooth.

756
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:13,680
It's like a Viking thing and it connects to your phone.

757
00:31:13,680 --> 00:31:15,600
And then as you brush your teeth, your phone goes,

758
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:17,920
hey, good job brushing your teeth, Travis.

759
00:31:17,920 --> 00:31:19,520
I'm very proud of you.

760
00:31:19,520 --> 00:31:22,880
And so I'm gonna give you a gift card to someplace

761
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:25,920
because I'm so proud of you, my precious good tooth boy.

762
00:31:26,560 --> 00:31:28,400
It works just like that.

763
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:30,400
And with the $45 quip smart brush,

764
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:32,880
which is now for adults and kids,

765
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:35,040
you could be doing this yourself at home.

766
00:31:35,040 --> 00:31:38,080
Not just listening to me brag about my good teeth,

767
00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:40,480
but you could be getting good teeth too.

768
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:41,440
And if you already have a quip,

769
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:42,880
you can upgrade it with a smart motor

770
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:44,560
and keep all the features you love.

771
00:31:44,560 --> 00:31:46,320
Plus you get brush heads, toothpaste

772
00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:48,640
and floss refills delivered for $5.

773
00:31:49,520 --> 00:31:52,160
Those floss things, by the way, are amazing.

774
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:54,480
It's like some space age flossing stuff.

775
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:55,520
I love it.

776
00:31:55,520 --> 00:31:58,720

781
00:32:11,920 --> 00:32:15,600
Quip, better oral health, made simple and rewarding.

782
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:17,360
I'm a dad.

783
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:17,760
What?

784
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:19,840
I'm not, yeah, I'm not afraid to admit it.

785
00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:23,840
And this week my wife has been working at the hospital

786
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:25,520
as she is want to do.

787
00:32:25,520 --> 00:32:27,520
And then yes, I do permit it.

788
00:32:27,520 --> 00:32:29,920
It's very progressive of me, I agree.

789
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:34,320
But that leaves me in charge of two rambunctious kids

790
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:37,440
that half of which are not in school

791
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:40,080
as much as I would have thought they would have been

792
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:41,920
just a scant year ago.

793
00:32:42,560 --> 00:32:44,960
So I'm a busy dad trying to make it on my own.

794
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:46,400
You know what my secret weapon is

795
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:47,840
when lunchtime is around the corner?

796
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:48,640
Alcohol.

797
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:50,720
Boo, a little scotchy scotch.

798
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:53,440
A little something, a little snoot for dad

799
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:54,320
but then for the kids.

800
00:32:54,320 --> 00:32:55,760
And a little sip for them.

801
00:32:56,640 --> 00:32:59,280
I don't reach for a container of mac and cheese.

802
00:32:59,280 --> 00:33:01,760
I reach for my phone to have someone bring me

803
00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:03,040
mac and cheese that's done.

804
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:06,880
Thank you DoorDash for helping me to keep my children fed.

805
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:08,960
I ask them, it's fun for them.

806
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:09,680
I let them pick.

807
00:33:09,680 --> 00:33:11,040
What are you guys in the mood for?

808
00:33:11,040 --> 00:33:12,000
You can have whatever you want

809
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:15,280
because DoorDash has like a bajillion restaurants,

810
00:33:15,280 --> 00:33:18,240
local places too so you can support local businesses

811
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:23,360
that you can't or shouldn't be attending in person right now.

812
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:26,160
You can still support them with DoorDash.

813
00:33:26,160 --> 00:33:28,000
Justin, what do they say they want?

814
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,000
They want a little coq au vin, huh?

815
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,720
They want a little coq au vin, a little chicken tendel.

816
00:33:33,680 --> 00:33:34,560
Ordering is easy.

817
00:33:34,560 --> 00:33:36,960
Open the app, you look for the food you want to eat,

818
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:38,400
you order the food, they bring it to you.

819
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:40,720
It's beautiful, it's fast, it's efficient.

820
00:33:41,280 --> 00:33:45,840
It really is what made my life

821
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:51,440
especially when I am watching two, yes, two children on my own.

822
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:52,240
All by yourself?

823
00:33:53,040 --> 00:33:55,200
Yeah, that's twice as many people as I am.

824
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:59,840
You know what, I have also a little life hack from me to you.

825
00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:02,000
Got a friend whose birthday it is

826
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:03,680
or maybe they're having a bad day?

827
00:34:03,680 --> 00:34:07,520
DoorDash them a cupcake or two from a local bakery.

828
00:34:07,520 --> 00:34:08,080
17.

829
00:34:08,080 --> 00:34:08,960
Brighten up their day.

830
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,400
Right now our listeners can get $5 off the first order

831
00:34:12,400 --> 00:34:16,240

00:34:16,240 --> 00:34:19,360
when you download the DoorDash app and enter code BROTHER.

833
00:34:19,360 --> 00:34:22,960
That's $5 off your first order and zero delivery fees for a month

834
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:24,880
when you download the DoorDash app in the app store

835
00:34:24,880 --> 00:34:26,560
and enter code BROTHER.

836
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:31,120
Don't forget, that's code BROTHER for $5 off your first order with DoorDash.

837
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:35,040
Hey friends, Jesse here, the founder of Maximum Fun

838
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:37,200
and I have some really great news to share with you.

839
00:34:37,840 --> 00:34:41,680
This year has brought a lot of changes for all of us.

840
00:34:41,680 --> 00:34:45,040
And one tradition that we were grateful to be able to hold on to

841
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:48,240
is our annual pin sale to benefit charity.

842
00:34:48,240 --> 00:34:50,800
This year, through your generosity and love of pins,

843
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:57,120
you helped raise $95,400 for GiveDirectly.

844
00:34:57,120 --> 00:34:59,920
If you're a member and you bought pins, they'll ship in January.

845
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:03,520
In the meantime, your support will provide direct cash relief

846
00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:07,360
to families impacted by COVID-19 across the United States.

847
00:35:07,360 --> 00:35:09,280
Even in this incredibly tough year,

848
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:12,800
the MaxFun community remains extraordinarily kind.

849
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:14,320
And whether or not you bought pins,

850
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:19,040
you can continue to help by heading to GiveDirectly.org.

851
00:35:19,600 --> 00:35:21,040
As always, thank you.

852
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:26,960
Um, do y'all want to know Yahoo?

853
00:35:28,080 --> 00:35:29,120
Yeah, I love that, Griffin.

854
00:35:29,120 --> 00:35:32,400
Okay, this one was sent in by TheWizardBenCant.

855
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:33,680
Thank you for asking by the way.

856
00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:34,480
Oh, sure.

857
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:36,800
Yeah, if you could imagine if I actually did it for real,

858
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:40,480
what, that's real bad boy behavior, not me.

859
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:44,160
An anonymous Yahoo Answers user asked this.

860
00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:48,400
I'm going to call Jameson's.

861
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:52,000
Asks, how do I stop my boyfriend

862
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:55,040
from reading me bedtime stories without hurting his feelings?

863
00:35:55,840 --> 00:35:58,400
My boyfriend recently started reading me bedtime stories

864
00:35:58,400 --> 00:35:59,360
a couple of weeks ago.

865
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:01,600
It was a joke at first because I'd said

866
00:36:01,600 --> 00:36:04,800
I wouldn't be able to sleep when I downed three coffees

867
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:05,680
that afternoon.

868
00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:08,800
The problem is he has done it every night since.

869
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:11,760
And he makes terrible mouth noises.

870
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:13,680
I don't even know where they are coming from.

871
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:15,360
It only happens when he's reading out loud.

872
00:36:15,360 --> 00:36:17,760
It makes me so irrationally angry and annoyed

873
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:20,560
that it takes me even longer to fall asleep than before.

874
00:36:20,560 --> 00:36:22,880
I am tired and exhausted, but I love this man.

875
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:23,600
Please help.

876
00:36:23,600 --> 00:36:25,760
And that's from Rosario Dawson.

877
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:30,640
That's from Scarlett Johansson,

878
00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:34,080
complaining about funny man, Colin Jones.

879
00:36:34,080 --> 00:36:36,080
Can we all, why did she label it?

880
00:36:36,080 --> 00:36:37,680
Nobody knows.

881
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:40,160
Until we got to the mouth sounds part,

882
00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:41,920
I was thinking, this sounds nice.

883
00:36:44,080 --> 00:36:48,000
Listen, I also am a dad and I also have two kids.

884
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:49,920
And when I'm putting the older one to bed,

885
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:50,960
I will read her a book.

886
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:52,400
I don't do this for the younger one

887
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:54,320
because she doesn't know what a book is.

888
00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:56,640
I'll sing her songs, don't worry.

889
00:36:56,640 --> 00:36:59,200
But I read to the older one and every time I do,

890
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:02,000
I think, who's going to put me to bed?

891
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:05,120
Where's the 12 foot tall person who's gonna carry me

892
00:37:05,120 --> 00:37:08,960
upstairs, make sure I go potty and put me to bed.

893
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:10,400
That's all I want.

894
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:13,120
Mine is Matthew McConaughey on the Calm app.

895
00:37:13,120 --> 00:37:14,080
He just sets me up.

896
00:37:14,080 --> 00:37:14,560
Oh yeah?

897
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:17,120
He's got a story on there where he talks about

898
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:21,200
the infinite light of the universe.

899
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:25,600
In many ways, I think maybe ASMR artists

900
00:37:25,600 --> 00:37:28,640
read me bedtime stories now that I'm thinking about it.

901
00:37:28,640 --> 00:37:29,600
It's a good way of thinking about it.

902
00:37:29,600 --> 00:37:30,560
Maybe that's it.

903
00:37:30,560 --> 00:37:32,880
It's like a bedtime story where someone pretends

904
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:34,160
to give you a cranial nerve exam.

905
00:37:34,160 --> 00:37:37,520
Yes, or maybe eat some Kentucky fried chicken in front of me.

906
00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:39,680
Don't fucking do that stuff, bud.

907
00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:42,480
I don't like hearing about your perversion.

908
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:45,840
I will not sit here in front of our audience

909
00:37:45,840 --> 00:37:50,720
who are basically our kids and be besmirched by you, sir,

910
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:53,040
just because you're so small minded,

911
00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:55,280
you won't watch someone eat a bunch of noodles.

912
00:37:57,360 --> 00:37:58,400
It's perverse.

913
00:37:58,400 --> 00:37:59,040
You're perverse.

914
00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:02,000
The idea that you would willingly subject yourself

915
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:05,040
to food eating noises is honestly, Travis,

916
00:38:05,680 --> 00:38:06,720
the worst thing about you.

917
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:07,440
What would you rather?

918
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:08,480
And that list is not short.

919
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:09,280
What would you rather?

920
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:10,080
I'm watching-

921
00:38:10,080 --> 00:38:10,720
Well detailed.

922
00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:12,720
You want me to watch whale noises?

923
00:38:12,720 --> 00:38:14,400
You whale pervert, huh?

924
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:15,440
Is that what you want?

925
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:17,840
For me to hear whales talking to each other?

926
00:38:17,840 --> 00:38:18,320
Or maybe-

927
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:18,880
Infinitely better.

928
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:19,520
Just maybe.

929
00:38:19,520 --> 00:38:20,240
Infinitely better.

930
00:38:20,240 --> 00:38:23,280
And you've also chosen, by the way, a beautiful animal sound.

931
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:23,760
So maybe try harder.

932
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:25,120
You don't fucking know what they're saying

933
00:38:25,120 --> 00:38:26,160
with those dirty birds.

934
00:38:26,160 --> 00:38:26,640
You can't even-

935
00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:27,120
Yeah, they can.

936
00:38:27,120 --> 00:38:30,800
You can't even come up with something that is more foul

937
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:32,720
than what you're describing because there isn't anything.

938
00:38:32,720 --> 00:38:34,160
I'm just saying that to me,

939
00:38:34,160 --> 00:38:36,480
hearing whales shit talk dolphins,

940
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:38,000
which is what it is, let's be honest.

941
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:38,720
It's what it is.

942
00:38:38,720 --> 00:38:39,440
That's what it is.

943
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:40,560
They're little whales.

944
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:41,520
They're shit talking dolphins.

945
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:44,880
Look at these dumb small whales.

946
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:48,240
You think that's better than me enjoying someone

947
00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:50,720
having the new Popeye's chicken sandwich?

948
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:52,880
That's how they shit talk the sun too.

949
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:55,040
Look at that huge bright whale.

950
00:38:55,040 --> 00:38:56,720
It's not even in the water.

951
00:38:56,720 --> 00:38:57,840
It's a shitty whale.

952
00:38:57,840 --> 00:38:59,600
I mean, what are these white puffy whales?

953
00:38:59,600 --> 00:39:03,680
And these whales with wings?

954
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:04,960
Don't get me started.

955
00:39:05,520 --> 00:39:07,280
Look at that touching the water.

956
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:08,800
It's the beach.

957
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:12,000
It's like a giant whale made of very small whales.

958
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:13,760
I'm going to swim up and crush it.

959
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:14,560
Oh no.

960
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:15,680
Oh no.

961
00:39:15,680 --> 00:39:17,520
Oh, what have I done?

962
00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:18,640
Someone blow me up.

963
00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:21,440
I messed up.

964
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:21,840
You got to-

965
00:39:21,840 --> 00:39:27,520
What if the whale was both conscious and speaking English?

966
00:39:27,520 --> 00:39:29,200
Like, listen, I got bad news for you.

967
00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:32,720
You're going to have to blow me up.

968
00:39:32,720 --> 00:39:33,440
You're going to have to-

969
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:34,960
No whale.

970
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:36,320
There has to be other options.

971
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:37,920
We can get some-

972
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:38,720
No, no, no.

973
00:39:38,720 --> 00:39:41,040
Listen, don't let me get stinky out here.

974
00:39:41,040 --> 00:39:42,960
It's going to take me days to die.

975
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:43,920
Please just blow me up.

976
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:46,720
Go get some of those round red exploding whales

977
00:39:46,720 --> 00:39:49,360
and tuck them in my hollow rotten stomach.

978
00:39:49,360 --> 00:39:54,560
I want to go meet the big whale up in the giant whale.

979
00:39:55,520 --> 00:39:56,880
Get the big blue whale.

980
00:39:57,520 --> 00:40:00,640
Hey, do you guys ever look up at the big black whale

981
00:40:00,640 --> 00:40:03,040
with those little shining whales in it and wonder,

982
00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:04,560
are there any other whales out there?

983
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:09,200
I mean, other than the billions of visible

984
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:11,840
and non-visible microscopic whales that surround us every day.

985
00:40:11,840 --> 00:40:14,240
But I mean, are there other whales on other whales up there

986
00:40:14,240 --> 00:40:16,240
looking back at our whale with us on it?

987
00:40:16,240 --> 00:40:18,880
I can't wait to go meet the big sky whale and say,

988
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:21,840
hey, sky whale, what was the deal with baleen?

989
00:40:21,840 --> 00:40:23,920
That shit is weird.

990
00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:25,280
Was that really the best option?

991
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:27,440
Could you have given me some bigger whales to eat?

992
00:40:27,440 --> 00:40:28,880
You gave me tiny whales.

993
00:40:28,880 --> 00:40:32,560
One time a bird accidentally fell in the water and drowned

994
00:40:32,560 --> 00:40:34,720
and I seen him and he didn't have baleen.

995
00:40:34,720 --> 00:40:36,640
So what's up, sky whale?

996
00:40:36,640 --> 00:40:41,040
Hey, big blue whale, why did thou name me after jizz?

997
00:40:41,040 --> 00:40:42,720
Not cool, dude.

998
00:40:42,720 --> 00:40:44,800
Couldn't we have just been friends?

999
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:47,440
Couldn't we have just been Jeff Whales?

1000
00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:51,280
My name's Jeff and most of us are down here.

1001
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:54,960
Hey, big blue whale, how come there's no whale week on TV?

1002
00:40:54,960 --> 00:40:56,080
We're way cooler.

1003
00:40:56,080 --> 00:40:58,720
We're way bigger, yeah.

1004
00:40:58,720 --> 00:40:59,440
Way bigger.

1005
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:02,560
What if they decide they're gonna eat all the sharks

1006
00:41:02,560 --> 00:41:05,120
or mean whales as they call them?

1007
00:41:05,120 --> 00:41:06,800
Bitey whales.

1008
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:08,320
They're gonna eat all the bitey whales

1009
00:41:08,320 --> 00:41:10,160
so they get a week of their very own.

1010
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:12,640
They're talking to killer whales and it's like,

1011
00:41:12,640 --> 00:41:15,280
hey, you're kind of a go-between between us and the bitey whales.

1012
00:41:16,480 --> 00:41:17,760
Tell them we want to join up.

1013
00:41:18,320 --> 00:41:21,200
We want to join up whales and bitey whales together

1014
00:41:21,840 --> 00:41:24,000
or we'll be unstoppable.

1015
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:27,760
Hey, big blue whale, why did you call us killer whales?

1016
00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:29,040
You know, I'm a dad.

1017
00:41:29,600 --> 00:41:32,160
And first and a podcaster second.

1018
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:33,760
And a-

1019
00:41:33,760 --> 00:41:35,040
Hey, is this still the whale talking?

1020
00:41:35,040 --> 00:41:35,680
Is this the whale?

1021
00:41:35,680 --> 00:41:38,240
And a flautist, I'm a flautist third.

1022
00:41:38,240 --> 00:41:39,840
See, now there's distance between them.

1023
00:41:39,840 --> 00:41:40,880
Okay, great, great, great.

1024
00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:42,640
I can think of other things people do.

1025
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:44,800
I've still got it.

1026
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:48,000
How about another question?

1027
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:50,400
Y'all know that Cory Booker reads books

1028
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:53,280
to Rosario Dawson over the phone.

1029
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:56,720
Yeah, that's why I mentioned Rosario Dawson earlier.

1030
00:41:57,360 --> 00:41:59,680
That's the service that Cory Booker provides

1031
00:41:59,680 --> 00:42:00,960
to his girlfriend, Rosario Dawson.

1032
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:04,240
I don't read Us Weekly or wherever this info is coming from.

1033
00:42:04,240 --> 00:42:07,360
Okay, I'm just saying it's a dope strat.

1034
00:42:07,360 --> 00:42:09,520
That's a dope love strat, I like that.

1035
00:42:09,520 --> 00:42:12,160
Now it's nice, no, it's definitely nice.

1036
00:42:12,160 --> 00:42:12,880
It's definitely nice.

1037
00:42:12,880 --> 00:42:14,560
Good morning, Rosario Dawson.

1038
00:42:14,560 --> 00:42:15,520
Would you like to hear more of the lovely-

1039
00:42:15,520 --> 00:42:16,960
Here's the very hungry caterpillar.

1040
00:42:16,960 --> 00:42:19,120
Would you like more of the lovely bones today?

1041
00:42:19,120 --> 00:42:20,000
Oh, okay.

1042
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:21,680
Aren't you busy running for president?

1043
00:42:21,680 --> 00:42:23,680
Nah, nah, nah, don't worry about that.

1044
00:42:23,680 --> 00:42:25,360
I'm sure that one will go swimmingly.

1045
00:42:26,240 --> 00:42:28,240
I get all my news from your stories.

1046
00:42:28,240 --> 00:42:30,480
So if you were or weren't running,

1047
00:42:30,480 --> 00:42:32,080
I'd have to hear about it in one of your stories

1048
00:42:32,080 --> 00:42:33,360
because you don't let me watch the TV.

1049
00:42:33,360 --> 00:42:42,240
No, you just get lovely bones in BookerVision.

1050
00:42:42,240 --> 00:42:44,240
In Bookerphonic sound.

1051
00:42:45,280 --> 00:42:47,680
I've got a scarf today, you know what that means.

1052
00:42:47,680 --> 00:42:48,720
I'm going to be enjoying,

1053
00:42:48,720 --> 00:42:51,120
you're going to be enjoying some more Dr. Doolittle.

1054
00:42:51,120 --> 00:42:51,680
Here we go.

1055
00:42:53,200 --> 00:42:55,760
Pygmalion, chapter one in BookerVision.

1056
00:42:58,320 --> 00:43:00,080
Here is another question from me to you.

1057
00:43:00,080 --> 00:43:00,400
Okay.

1058
00:43:00,400 --> 00:43:03,520
My girlfriend and I have been dating for a little under six months.

1059
00:43:03,520 --> 00:43:05,600
I've only met her family a handful of times,

1060
00:43:05,600 --> 00:43:08,720
but her mother recently asked me to buy her shrooms.

1061
00:43:09,520 --> 00:43:10,800
We got to be a little bit more,

1062
00:43:11,520 --> 00:43:14,080
that could mean, that sentence could mean 18 different things.

1063
00:43:14,080 --> 00:43:16,560
We've got to be a little bit more specific here.

1064
00:43:16,560 --> 00:43:19,440
Is it possible I will be doing shrooms with her?

1065
00:43:20,080 --> 00:43:22,720
How do I make a shroom trip with my girlfriend's mother

1066
00:43:22,720 --> 00:43:25,360
not an entirely awkward experience?

1067
00:43:25,360 --> 00:43:28,160
That's from, this is going to be a disaster in Denver,

1068
00:43:28,160 --> 00:43:30,400
which with that attitude, it will be.

1069
00:43:30,400 --> 00:43:31,440
Is it possible?

1070
00:43:32,320 --> 00:43:35,440
Is it possible that your girlfriend's mother

1071
00:43:35,440 --> 00:43:37,360
asked you to go to the store

1072
00:43:37,360 --> 00:43:39,680
and buy her some regular ass mushrooms?

1073
00:43:39,680 --> 00:43:42,400
Some nice cremini for the Thanksgiving stuff?

1074
00:43:42,400 --> 00:43:44,000
Just some baby bellas.

1075
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:48,400
Did she say, hey, could you buy me some mushrooms?

1076
00:43:48,400 --> 00:43:50,720
And what she meant was for dinner on Friday

1077
00:43:50,720 --> 00:43:54,000
and not perhaps a psychotropic experience.

1078
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:55,360
I don't want to get into semantics,

1079
00:43:55,360 --> 00:43:56,960
but they're still mushrooms, aren't they?

1080
00:43:56,960 --> 00:43:59,360
I mean, you haven't, huh?

1081
00:43:59,360 --> 00:44:03,600
It is a test and I don't know which kind

1082
00:44:04,160 --> 00:44:07,760
because it's either a test to see if you're a,

1083
00:44:07,760 --> 00:44:10,080
you know, fucking a wasteoid,

1084
00:44:10,080 --> 00:44:12,480
or it could be a test to see if you're cool

1085
00:44:12,480 --> 00:44:14,800
and like to party and cool enough to hang with the mom.

1086
00:44:15,760 --> 00:44:17,040
The dad doesn't want to hear,

1087
00:44:17,680 --> 00:44:18,560
dad doesn't want to hear,

1088
00:44:18,560 --> 00:44:22,080
he turns his head away from this stuff

1089
00:44:22,080 --> 00:44:23,200
that the mom likes to do,

1090
00:44:23,200 --> 00:44:28,000
which is get whacked out, get totally fucking zooted.

1091
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:30,640
Is it also possible that she wants the shrooms

1092
00:44:31,680 --> 00:44:33,680
not to do them with you though?

1093
00:44:33,680 --> 00:44:35,760
She's gonna take them back to her house

1094
00:44:35,760 --> 00:44:38,080
and just kind of enjoy them

1095
00:44:38,080 --> 00:44:41,680
with a nice glass of wine and a relaxing film.

1096
00:44:41,680 --> 00:44:44,800
It's very possible to the point where I would say

1097
00:44:44,800 --> 00:44:48,160
it is far more impossible that your girlfriend's mother

1098
00:44:48,160 --> 00:44:50,320
who you barely know said,

1099
00:44:50,320 --> 00:44:53,280
hey, you know what would be fun?

1100
00:44:54,240 --> 00:44:56,320
Shrooming with what's-his-face.

1101
00:44:56,320 --> 00:44:56,640
Yeah.

1102
00:44:58,080 --> 00:45:00,480
Folks, I've bought some drugs in my time.

1103
00:45:01,280 --> 00:45:01,520
What?

1104
00:45:02,720 --> 00:45:04,080
It is, I would say,

1105
00:45:04,080 --> 00:45:07,440
the times when the person I've bought the drugs from

1106
00:45:07,440 --> 00:45:09,600
is the person I'm hoping to do drugs with

1107
00:45:09,600 --> 00:45:14,400
has been, I would say, in the minority for me personally.

1108
00:45:14,960 --> 00:45:18,720
I don't think that's what your girlfriend's mother

1109
00:45:18,720 --> 00:45:19,280
is planning right now.

1110
00:45:19,280 --> 00:45:21,200
What I do like, though, question asker,

1111
00:45:21,200 --> 00:45:23,840
is what you decided to do in this scenario

1112
00:45:23,840 --> 00:45:26,240
was not to ask your girlfriend

1113
00:45:26,960 --> 00:45:29,280
what your girlfriend's opinion might be,

1114
00:45:29,280 --> 00:45:31,680
but rather ask the three of us

1115
00:45:32,720 --> 00:45:36,400
who know this mother even less than you do.

1116
00:45:37,520 --> 00:45:38,560
If that's even possible.

1117
00:45:38,560 --> 00:45:40,960
So I'm gonna say fucking do it, bro.

1118
00:45:42,800 --> 00:45:44,160
I think that would be fun as hell.

1119
00:45:44,160 --> 00:45:46,800
I haven't shroomed in a dog's age.

1120
00:45:46,800 --> 00:45:47,920
Shroomed, is that acceptable?

1121
00:45:47,920 --> 00:45:48,480
Probably not.

1122
00:45:48,480 --> 00:45:49,840
Is that the accepted?

1123
00:45:49,840 --> 00:45:53,840
I haven't, let's see, I haven't mushed in forever.

1124
00:45:53,840 --> 00:45:54,640
Mushed is good.

1125
00:45:54,640 --> 00:45:55,200
Yeah.

1126
00:45:55,200 --> 00:45:55,520
I like mushed.

1127
00:45:55,520 --> 00:45:58,480
I haven't had a full-blown mushy in forever.

1128
00:45:58,480 --> 00:45:59,040
Right.

1129
00:45:59,040 --> 00:46:03,120
And I would love to just mush it up with somebody

1130
00:46:03,120 --> 00:46:05,200
and get to know them through that experience.

1131
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:07,360
I will say this, though.

1132
00:46:07,360 --> 00:46:08,880
Okay, now wait a minute, hold on.

1133
00:46:10,240 --> 00:46:15,040
If the girlfriend's mother was asking you to buy shrooms,

1134
00:46:15,040 --> 00:46:17,840
they don't, maybe they're not that looped in.

1135
00:46:17,840 --> 00:46:19,200
They just think they'd like to try it.

1136
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:24,480
Are you willing to take the responsibility of like,

1137
00:46:24,480 --> 00:46:25,440
here's some shrooms.

1138
00:46:25,440 --> 00:46:28,160
Do the right amount of them, I guess.

1139
00:46:28,160 --> 00:46:30,800
Don't eat a bunch or too little.

1140
00:46:30,800 --> 00:46:31,280
Yeah.

1141
00:46:31,280 --> 00:46:32,160
Best of luck.

1142
00:46:32,160 --> 00:46:33,760
I feel like they're gonna need,

1143
00:46:33,760 --> 00:46:35,360
here's something decent you could do.

1144
00:46:35,920 --> 00:46:37,920
You could offer to just be a drug Sherpa.

1145
00:46:37,920 --> 00:46:39,840
Oh yeah, you gotta have a spotter.

1146
00:46:40,560 --> 00:46:41,840
Listen, let me spot you.

1147
00:46:41,840 --> 00:46:43,360
Let me take you to the,

1148
00:46:43,360 --> 00:46:45,440
let me help you find the safe rooms in your house.

1149
00:46:45,440 --> 00:46:48,000
The rooms that become safe during the experience.

1150
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:50,320
I'll make sure you don't order too much pizza

1151
00:46:50,320 --> 00:46:52,080
just to experience it.

1152
00:46:52,080 --> 00:46:53,920
Let me remind you that your life water

1153
00:46:53,920 --> 00:46:55,280
has become incredibly warm

1154
00:46:55,280 --> 00:46:56,880
and you could probably get a new life water

1155
00:46:56,880 --> 00:46:58,800
out of the fridge and enjoy that.

1156
00:46:58,800 --> 00:47:00,640
I know a lot of people.

1157
00:47:00,640 --> 00:47:01,360
I'm not gonna brag.

1158
00:47:01,360 --> 00:47:02,240
I know a lot of people.

1159
00:47:02,240 --> 00:47:02,880
Here he goes.

1160
00:47:02,880 --> 00:47:05,440
I don't know any of them.

1161
00:47:06,080 --> 00:47:08,560
Maybe a small handful of very close confidants.

1162
00:47:09,840 --> 00:47:13,200
A lot of codicils on this.

1163
00:47:13,200 --> 00:47:15,440
I'm just saying, I don't know many people

1164
00:47:15,440 --> 00:47:16,400
that I would be like,

1165
00:47:16,400 --> 00:47:18,960
I think this is a person who could get me shrooms.

1166
00:47:19,520 --> 00:47:20,800
Like, I don't know.

1167
00:47:20,800 --> 00:47:24,640
That's such a bold maneuver to posit,

1168
00:47:24,640 --> 00:47:27,840
like, you are giving off perhaps

1169
00:47:27,840 --> 00:47:29,760
a certain kind of energy question asker

1170
00:47:29,760 --> 00:47:31,760
that I personally love.

1171
00:47:31,760 --> 00:47:34,000
Travis, you have presupposed that there,

1172
00:47:34,800 --> 00:47:38,240
you can have multiple people in your life

1173
00:47:38,240 --> 00:47:40,800
that you know they could get you shrooms.

1174
00:47:40,800 --> 00:47:43,280
I don't think that that is true for anybody,

1175
00:47:43,280 --> 00:47:46,080
but I would argue that most people of a certain age

1176
00:47:46,800 --> 00:47:49,760
definitely know that one person

1177
00:47:50,320 --> 00:47:53,280
that can for sure get you shrooms.

1178
00:47:53,280 --> 00:47:56,320
And it is wild that you have become that person

1179
00:47:57,280 --> 00:47:58,880
to your lover's mother.

1180
00:47:59,600 --> 00:48:00,480
And can you?

1181
00:48:01,120 --> 00:48:03,040
Because, like, you don't address in this,

1182
00:48:03,040 --> 00:48:04,400
like, I don't know how to.

1183
00:48:04,400 --> 00:48:07,200
You seem like you would be able to.

1184
00:48:07,200 --> 00:48:09,120
That doesn't seem to be the question.

1185
00:48:09,120 --> 00:48:11,120
Yeah.

1186
00:48:11,120 --> 00:48:12,560
One time a girl in gym class

1187
00:48:12,560 --> 00:48:14,800
offered to sell me a single Vicodin in a baggie.

1188
00:48:15,840 --> 00:48:17,440
And I didn't even,

1189
00:48:17,440 --> 00:48:19,440
I was so unplugged in

1190
00:48:19,440 --> 00:48:20,960
that I couldn't even really process

1191
00:48:20,960 --> 00:48:24,080
that that's what was sort of occurring.

1192
00:48:24,080 --> 00:48:25,600
And I was so afraid that it was a crime

1193
00:48:25,600 --> 00:48:28,240
to even hear her talking that I got scared

1194
00:48:28,240 --> 00:48:29,760
and just kind of walked away.

1195
00:48:29,760 --> 00:48:31,520
But later I started thinking about, like,

1196
00:48:31,520 --> 00:48:33,120
no one, and here's the thing.

1197
00:48:33,120 --> 00:48:34,240
I'm 40 years old now.

1198
00:48:34,240 --> 00:48:37,360
No one had ever seen me like that before.

1199
00:48:37,360 --> 00:48:39,200
And no one ever saw me like that again.

1200
00:48:39,840 --> 00:48:41,520
And I still wonder to this day,

1201
00:48:42,480 --> 00:48:45,760
what was the vibe that I gave her

1202
00:48:45,760 --> 00:48:48,720
that I've never given another living human being

1203
00:48:48,720 --> 00:48:51,280
where it's like, this seems like the kind of guy

1204
00:48:51,280 --> 00:48:53,120
who'd buy a single Vicodin in a baggie.

1205
00:48:53,120 --> 00:48:54,800
Justin, I've never thought about this before,

1206
00:48:54,800 --> 00:48:56,240
but now you're making me think about the fact

1207
00:48:56,240 --> 00:48:57,840
no one's ever asked me

1208
00:48:58,400 --> 00:49:01,040
if I A, want to buy drugs

1209
00:49:01,040 --> 00:49:02,960
or B, know where to buy drugs.

1210
00:49:03,760 --> 00:49:04,720
Like, this is never,

1211
00:49:04,720 --> 00:49:07,760
and I think I'm approachable.

1212
00:49:08,320 --> 00:49:09,360
I think I'm cool.

1213
00:49:10,080 --> 00:49:11,440
You know, I've got purple hair.

1214
00:49:11,440 --> 00:49:13,520
Well, approachable, definitely.

1215
00:49:13,520 --> 00:49:14,720
But no one has ever,

1216
00:49:15,680 --> 00:49:17,840
they've offered me drugs, don't get me wrong.

1217
00:49:17,840 --> 00:49:20,000
They've offered me drugs.

1218
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:21,040
Yeah, we're podcasters.

1219
00:49:21,040 --> 00:49:23,520
But they've never asked if I wanted to buy them

1220
00:49:24,080 --> 00:49:25,920
or said, hey, do you know where to buy drugs?

1221
00:49:25,920 --> 00:49:27,840
It's just never, huh.

1222
00:49:27,840 --> 00:49:30,160
One time I was visiting, when I was in college,

1223
00:49:30,160 --> 00:49:35,760
I went over to my girlfriend's old friend's place.

1224
00:49:35,760 --> 00:49:40,240
He lived in a frat house to go play Halo

1225
00:49:40,240 --> 00:49:42,720
because I was just trying to ingratiate myself

1226
00:49:42,720 --> 00:49:43,840
to her friends.

1227
00:49:43,840 --> 00:49:47,600
And I went over there and realized nobody else was there.

1228
00:49:47,600 --> 00:49:50,240
I thought it was going to be more of a land party vibe.

1229
00:49:50,240 --> 00:49:52,880
But no, it was just me and this gentleman.

1230
00:49:52,880 --> 00:49:56,000
And we played some Halo and he made some remarks.

1231
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:58,320
And then at one point he said,

1232
00:49:58,320 --> 00:50:00,640
hey man, do you want some Xanny bars?

1233
00:50:01,360 --> 00:50:03,280
And I said, oh yeah.

1234
00:50:03,280 --> 00:50:05,280
Thinking that that was going to be

1235
00:50:05,280 --> 00:50:12,000
some sort of delectable, some sort of tasty thing.

1236
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:15,040
Like I thought maybe the frat house just had a bake sale.

1237
00:50:16,960 --> 00:50:18,160
And then he brought out like-

1238
00:50:18,160 --> 00:50:21,680
My man Xanny makes these bars so good.

1239
00:50:21,680 --> 00:50:23,520
Fucking condensed milk, coconut.

1240
00:50:23,520 --> 00:50:28,560
He brought out this cloudy sandwich bag

1241
00:50:28,560 --> 00:50:30,720
of what were very clearly pills.

1242
00:50:30,720 --> 00:50:32,720
And I said, oh no, I don't.

1243
00:50:34,080 --> 00:50:35,120
No, sorry.

1244
00:50:35,120 --> 00:50:35,920
Sorry there, Bronco.

1245
00:50:35,920 --> 00:50:36,560
That's on him.

1246
00:50:36,560 --> 00:50:38,400
These are antacids because we're about to eat

1247
00:50:38,400 --> 00:50:39,360
so many Xanny bars.

1248
00:50:39,360 --> 00:50:42,560
Marshmallow and chocolate chips Xanny bars, baby.

1249
00:50:42,560 --> 00:50:44,880
Sorry, I thought you said Zanza bars.

1250
00:50:44,880 --> 00:50:46,560
And I would have loved that.

1251
00:50:46,560 --> 00:50:48,000
That one's on him though, Griffin.

1252
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:52,080
That's not your fault because that's not in the bar form at all.

1253
00:50:52,080 --> 00:50:54,160
So like, what the fuck was he even talking about?

1254
00:50:54,160 --> 00:50:55,360
I don't know.

1255
00:50:55,360 --> 00:50:59,040
I didn't do much research into it after the fact.

1256
00:51:01,120 --> 00:51:03,200
Honestly, was I embarrassed?

1257
00:51:03,200 --> 00:51:03,600
Yes.

1258
00:51:03,600 --> 00:51:06,080
Was I embarrassed that I whiffed it that bad

1259
00:51:06,720 --> 00:51:09,760
in front of somebody who just moments before

1260
00:51:10,720 --> 00:51:13,200
I intended to impress in some way?

1261
00:51:14,240 --> 00:51:14,720
Yes.

1262
00:51:14,720 --> 00:51:18,240
But was that embarrassment completely overshadowed

1263
00:51:18,240 --> 00:51:20,720
by my disappointment that I wasn't about to eat

1264
00:51:20,720 --> 00:51:24,960
some delicious, gooey, moist Xanny bars?

1265
00:51:24,960 --> 00:51:25,520
Yeah.

1266
00:51:25,520 --> 00:51:27,280
Something you've never even heard of before.

1267
00:51:27,280 --> 00:51:29,280
Damn, I was so certain in that moment

1268
00:51:29,280 --> 00:51:32,000
that I was gonna fucking yummy those up.

1269
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:32,480
Damn it.

1270
00:51:33,280 --> 00:51:36,320
Hey, thank you so much for listening to our podcast,

1271
00:51:36,320 --> 00:51:37,360
My Brother, My Brother, and Me.

1272
00:51:38,160 --> 00:51:39,760
We hope you've enjoyed yourself.

1273
00:51:39,760 --> 00:51:42,960
We hope you're having a good week.

1274
00:51:43,520 --> 00:51:48,480
Just a reminder to stay at home this week

1275
00:51:48,480 --> 00:51:53,600
and don't gather with your family who-

1276
00:51:53,600 --> 00:51:54,240
Or friends.

1277
00:51:55,200 --> 00:51:58,080
Or friends who you don't see every single day.

1278
00:51:58,880 --> 00:52:01,600
There's no special magic about-

1279
00:52:01,600 --> 00:52:02,640
Well, there's love.

1280
00:52:02,640 --> 00:52:03,360
There's holiday love.

1281
00:52:03,360 --> 00:52:04,400
No, Chris.

1282
00:52:04,400 --> 00:52:06,640
But not a special magic that's going to protect you from-

1283
00:52:06,640 --> 00:52:08,960
Yeah, COVID don't care about love.

1284
00:52:08,960 --> 00:52:11,360
If there's one thing I've learned from that hit

1285
00:52:11,360 --> 00:52:14,240
country and western song, COVID don't care about love,

1286
00:52:14,240 --> 00:52:15,840
it's that COVID don't care about love.

1287
00:52:15,840 --> 00:52:17,040
Don't care about love, yeah.

1288
00:52:17,040 --> 00:52:20,560
Yeah, so please be safe, be smart.

1289
00:52:20,560 --> 00:52:22,400
Though I will say, speaking of love,

1290
00:52:22,400 --> 00:52:26,160
thank you to everybody who came to the live show,

1291
00:52:26,160 --> 00:52:27,360
who watched the live show.

1292
00:52:27,360 --> 00:52:28,640
It was such a fun experience.

1293
00:52:28,640 --> 00:52:30,880
And everybody, you were so lovely afterwards

1294
00:52:30,880 --> 00:52:33,760
and you're gonna make us wanna do it again.

1295
00:52:33,760 --> 00:52:36,080
Yeah, we will never tour again.

1296
00:52:36,080 --> 00:52:37,360
This is it now.

1297
00:52:37,360 --> 00:52:37,840
Are you kidding?

1298
00:52:37,840 --> 00:52:39,920
This is our new WALL-E style of tour.

1299
00:52:39,920 --> 00:52:43,280
I got to fucking sleep in my bed that night, my bed.

1300
00:52:43,280 --> 00:52:45,360
I got to, right before the show, I took a shower

1301
00:52:45,360 --> 00:52:48,000
and I used my special prescription strength

1302
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:51,040
anti-dandruff shampoo in my shower.

1303
00:52:51,600 --> 00:52:53,680
I am never leaving the house again.

1304
00:52:53,680 --> 00:52:54,080
Thank you.

1305
00:52:55,040 --> 00:52:55,520
Thank you so much.

1306
00:52:55,520 --> 00:52:57,280
Thanks to John Roderick in the long winters

1307
00:52:57,280 --> 00:52:58,800
for the use of our theme song, It's a Departure,

1308
00:52:58,800 --> 00:53:00,800
off the album, Putting the Days to Bed.

1309
00:53:00,800 --> 00:53:02,880
Great tunes, baby.

1310
00:53:02,880 --> 00:53:05,360
Good friends, good fun, good tunes.

1311
00:53:05,360 --> 00:53:08,560
Great tunes, and thanks to Maximum Fun

1312
00:53:08,560 --> 00:53:09,120
for having us on the network.

1313
00:53:09,120 --> 00:53:10,160
Yes, indeed.

1314
00:53:10,160 --> 00:53:12,480
There's a really great podcast I'd like to tell you about.

1315
00:53:12,480 --> 00:53:13,760
It's called The Besties.

1316
00:53:13,760 --> 00:53:17,440
And if you, like me, have been unable to obtain

1317
00:53:17,440 --> 00:53:21,920
either a PlayStation 5 or an Xbox Series X, and you-

1318
00:53:21,920 --> 00:53:23,840
He's about to pivot into asking our listeners.

1319
00:53:23,840 --> 00:53:24,640
For sure, for sure, for sure.

1320
00:53:24,640 --> 00:53:25,440
Oh, no, no, no.

1321
00:53:25,440 --> 00:53:27,760
I was going to say, if you want to hear people talk about them

1322
00:53:27,760 --> 00:53:32,720
and long to one day rest your hands upon their new sleek bodies,

1323
00:53:32,720 --> 00:53:34,560
well, then you're going to want to check out The Besties.

1324
00:53:34,560 --> 00:53:37,760
It's Justin Griffin and our friends Russ Frushtek

00:53:44,240 --> 00:53:46,720

1329
00:53:46,720 --> 00:53:48,400
and my favorite gaming podcast.

1330
00:53:48,400 --> 00:53:49,200
Almost said it's favorite.

1331
00:53:49,200 --> 00:53:50,000
Yeah, but it's not.

1332
00:53:50,960 --> 00:53:53,680
I don't miss an episode, and I'm very excited to hear

1333
00:53:53,680 --> 00:53:56,160

1334
00:53:56,160 --> 00:53:58,240

1362
00:55:03,360 --> 00:55:07,600
why do big, beautiful men love putting so much seasonings

1363
00:55:07,600 --> 00:55:08,560
