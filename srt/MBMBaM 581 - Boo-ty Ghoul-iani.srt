00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,200
Hello, what you are about to hear is a podcast.

2
00:00:03,200 --> 00:00:05,960
And what that means is we're gonna talk into microphones

3
00:00:05,960 --> 00:00:10,960
and then broadcast it on pods, in your iPods.

4
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:14,200
You're gonna hear this on your iPod.

5
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:16,680
And so I just wanted to give you an intro

6
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:19,040
in case you were confused as to what was happening.

7
00:00:19,040 --> 00:00:21,720
Sometimes we'll say pretty silly stuff.

8
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:26,080
But we're not being wrong.

9
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:28,720
We're doing a joke to make you laugh.

10
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:32,800
And also, I wanted to say to my grandpa, Dan,

11
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:34,640
who I asked to listen to this one.

12
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:37,360
Well, I'm glad that you figured, I knew you could do it.

13
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:38,240
Yeah.

14
00:00:38,240 --> 00:00:39,920
I knew you could do it, G-Pod Dan.

15
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:41,280
I knew you could listen to a podcast.

16
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:44,280
Downloaded it through Napster and now you're listening to it.

17
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:45,120
And listen, folks.

18
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:47,000
Thank you for pirating our podcast, Grandpa Dan.

19
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,580
Just a little prologue.

20
00:00:48,580 --> 00:00:50,880
You're gonna hear us make some pretty obscure references

21
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:52,360
and you're gonna think, oh, I don't get this

22
00:00:52,360 --> 00:00:53,920
because I'm not a regular listener.

23
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:55,280
But the truth is you don't get it

24
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:57,040
because you're not one of the three of us

25
00:00:57,040 --> 00:00:59,000
and sometimes not even then.

26
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,080
Yeah, true.

27
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:02,400
Sometimes the things we say just isn't funny.

28
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:03,240
No, listen.

29
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:04,120
And it's nothing.

30
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:06,160
We'll be interrupting the show throughout

31
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:07,720
to try to give you some context,

32
00:01:07,720 --> 00:01:09,560
but we think you're set up now.

33
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:11,440
What you're gonna hear next is the introduction.

34
00:01:11,440 --> 00:01:13,080
Now, in my brother, my brother and me,

35
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:14,760
this is our show that we do.

36
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:18,360
That's where we normally do sort of a slice of life,

37
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:21,840
skewed view, twisted perspective on current events.

38
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:24,520
Sometimes we talk about movies for a really long time

39
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:26,280
and it's unclear even to us

40
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:29,040
if we're actually excited about them or not.

41
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:30,560
And sometimes when we struggle to think

42
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:32,960
of something funny to say, we just cuss a lot.

43
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:35,000
So please be prepared for that.

44
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,560
That's kind of throughout though.

45
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:38,360
That's not just an introduction thing.

46
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:40,960
We're gonna begin now, okay?

47
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:42,920
But if you get scared at any point,

48
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:46,240
please, please tell one of us and we will stop.

49
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:48,240
Just raise your hands.

50
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:49,740
It's an interactive experience.

51
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:50,580
Okay, here we go.

52
00:01:50,580 --> 00:01:51,420
You ready?

53
00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:53,920
The McElroy brothers are not experts

54
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:56,800
and their advice should never be followed.

55
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:59,160
Travis insists he's a sexpert,

56
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:02,540
but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

57
00:02:02,540 --> 00:02:04,880
Also, this show isn't for kids,

58
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:07,240
which I mentioned only so the babies out there

59
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:09,360
will know how cool they are for listening.

60
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:10,960
What's up, you cool baby?

61
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:12,120
One, two, three, four.

62
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:16,880
It's the start of something beautiful.

63
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:19,800
A small acquaintance has blossomed.

64
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:24,320
It's ripen into a precious friendship.

65
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:27,480
I could have never seen what was coming for me.

66
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:30,320
Hangs at the skate park, hangs by the beach.

67
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:37,320
My life, it feels like life.

68
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:42,120
Oh, it's better, it's better with you.

69
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:48,120
My life, oh, it's better, it's better with you.

70
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:54,120
This is true, oh, it's better, it's better with you.

71
00:02:54,120 --> 00:03:01,960
My life, oh, it's better with you.

72
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:02,800
Hello, everybody, and welcome.

73
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:04,420
Oh, no, wait, no, Justin.

74
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:06,200
Quieter.

75
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:07,140
No, why is it quiet?

76
00:03:07,140 --> 00:03:09,680
They can like hot, just because they're new

77
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:11,960
doesn't mean they don't like it fucking hot.

78
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:12,800
Oh, that's true.

79
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:13,640
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

80
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:14,800
Hello, everybody, and welcome.

81
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:16,160
Wait, this is the music we always play.

82
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:19,840
Okay, hello, everybody, it was too annoying.

83
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:20,840
I couldn't even do more than this.

84
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:22,480
It's so short, every episode.

85
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:24,400
Hey, everybody, welcome to My Brother, My Brother,

86
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:26,680
the advice show for the modern era.

87
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:28,920
I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy.

88
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:30,280
I've always said modern like that.

89
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:32,520
Yeah, and then I'm gonna say middle-est,

90
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:34,640
which isn't a real word as far as I know,

91
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:36,600
but I am the most middle, right?

92
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:39,120
And I'm, oh, I'm also gonna say like a big dog woof woof,

93
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:41,720
and that's because every year we brand the year,

94
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:43,880
and this is 20 Big Dog Run.

95
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:45,120
What does that mean, you ask?

96
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:46,160
I don't know.

97
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:47,760
And I'm your middle-est brother,

98
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:51,400
Travis Big Dog Woof Woof McElroy.

99
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:53,680
What's up, shit stains?

100
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:56,080
Whoa, wait, now hold on.

101
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:58,320
Griffin has never brought this energy before.

102
00:03:58,320 --> 00:04:00,760
I think Griffin's trying to re-brand.

103
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:03,400
That's sort of how I come into the beginning of it.

104
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:05,240
Every episode is very complicated.

105
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:07,280
It's not, don't lie to them, they don't know the joke.

106
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:08,800
That is never, you've never done it before.

107
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:09,880
Is it the voice?

108
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:11,480
Do you think is it the voice?

109
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:13,520
You called them shit stains, Griffin.

110
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:15,080
Hold on, let me try it, let me try again.

111
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:16,400
What's up, skid marks?

112
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:18,960
No, well, that's, I mean, better.

113
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:20,280
That's noticeably better.

114
00:04:20,280 --> 00:04:21,720
It's better.

115
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:23,840
Not quite, it feels more affectionate,

116
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:24,840
it has an affectionate energy.

117
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:26,320
What's up, droopy drawers?

118
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:30,480
It's Griffin McElroy, the youngest one.

119
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:32,560
But Griffin, you're usually kind of the sweet one,

120
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:35,000
and I'm kind of the bad boy in the group.

121
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,920
And I need you to bring some more like sweet energy

122
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:40,360
so people know that like you're the safe one.

123
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:43,160
What's up, shit stains?

124
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:45,480
Okay, just to get some questions out of the way

125
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:48,720
for new listeners, this is the Max Fun Block Party,

126
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:51,960
which is where we're trying to onboard new people,

127
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:53,120
say welcome in.

128
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:57,440
This show actually doesn't lean on,

129
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:59,800
people accuse us of doing a lot of in-jokes.

130
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:02,600
I try to avoid that actually, hilariously.

131
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:04,200
I try to avoid that in this show.

132
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:06,760
It just is a lot of non-secret, it's a lot of times.

133
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:09,120
It feels like in-jokes that you assume like,

134
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:10,520
oh, people have listened before,

135
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:11,560
understand what they're talking about.

136
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:13,760
But as I said earlier, no.

137
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:18,040
No, no, but we're trying to make, here's the setup, right?

138
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:22,440
We're actual ass brothers, like real brothers.

139
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:25,640
Not a joke, we're the McElroys who grew up together.

140
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:28,720
Our dad's Clint, we do the Adventure Zone together.

141
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:33,640
And we have done since 2010, April 2010,

142
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:37,080
we've done an advice program that you are now listening to

143
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:39,800
and enjoying, we hope, I mean, right now.

144
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:41,120
So we've been doing it for a long time.

145
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:42,880
This is our 580th episode.

146
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:44,960
And the show has evolved,

147
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:48,560
but not as much as like you would think, right?

148
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:52,200
It's not like, you know, a general hospital

149
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:55,360
where 11 years later it would be unrecognizable.

150
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:56,760
This is still basically the same thing.

151
00:05:56,760 --> 00:06:01,040
It's the same stick, but we're a lot tireder.

152
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:04,000
That's true, we're older now, we've got kids.

153
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,480
And God knows how many at this point.

154
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:10,400
And I also know- We have six kids, two each.

155
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:11,280
You can't do this.

156
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:12,120
Oh, you're right, you're right.

157
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:14,080
This is our first year of the show, we have two kids.

158
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:15,560
We have two kids each, six total.

159
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:16,680
We share two kids.

160
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:19,160
We have two kids, it's a timeshare program.

161
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:22,440
We went in together to buy the kids.

162
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:25,000
We each get four months.

163
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,640
But, and I know what you're wondering,

164
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:28,360
I've been listening now to the show for a while

165
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:30,480
and they haven't given any advice yet.

166
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:32,320
Anybody get used to that.

167
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:33,160
That doesn't happen.

168
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:34,520
Not as much advice these days.

169
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:36,520
We're not qualified in any way.

170
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:38,280
And we've also, at this point, as you said,

171
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:41,160
581 episodes in, basically answered

172
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:42,880
every problem the world has.

173
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:43,720
There's nothing new under the sun.

174
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:45,600
Right, it's just no one listens is the problem.

175
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:46,440
Yeah.

176
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:47,280
You know what I mean, no one listens.

177
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:48,120
No one ever does always say, yeah.

178
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:50,680
Well, it's because Bob Ball back there in the beginning

179
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:52,760
is like, don't listen to the brothers.

180
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:54,800
And it's like, God damn it, Bob Ball.

181
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:57,760
So, I know you're wondering,

182
00:06:57,760 --> 00:07:01,240
if this is a block party, where is the snacks?

183
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:02,440
Where are the snacks?

184
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:05,680
The answer is, you gotta download them.

185
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:10,280
We are uploading pictures of some amazing snacks.

186
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:11,920
I made a Jell-O mold.

187
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:13,680
Yeah, Travis did a Jell-O mold.

188
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:16,800
I got some pimento pasta salad.

189
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:17,640
Ooh.

190
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:19,960
And that's gonna be a beautiful JPEG.

191
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:22,040
And you're gonna really taste the highlights

192
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:24,120
and shadows and colors on that one.

193
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:25,360
So, enjoy that.

194
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:26,760
We got some bands coming out.

195
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:29,200
What's up, Blues Traveler coming out

196
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:31,040
on main stage at 7 p.m. Not him.

197
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:33,280
Not gonna have, not, it's Blues Traveler,

198
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:35,840
but without John Popper, because he kind of sucks.

199
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:39,240
Oh, okay, well then it's a harmonica-free

200
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:41,320
Blues Traveler experience.

201
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:44,920
It's just kind of an acoustic, non-harmonica Blues Traveler.

202
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:47,840
Let me be rad if the Blues Traveler guy one time

203
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:51,120
forgot his harmonicas, like he left his harmonica vest

204
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:52,960
in his trunk with all his guns.

205
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:55,520
And when the concert started, that's when he realized

206
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:59,360
that he had to make harmonica noises in his mouth.

207
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:01,400
Let's see if anybody noticed.

208
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:03,200
Hey, does anybody have any like wax paper

209
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:04,600
I can put on the comb?

210
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:05,440
Anybody?

211
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:07,160
Damn it.

212
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:08,880
I went to Juilliard.

213
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:13,080
So, just to kind of start, do you know where

214
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:14,880
Dracula's setting music?

215
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:15,720
Where?

216
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:16,560
Where?

217
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:17,400
Boo-li-yard.

218
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:18,240
Oh, God.

219
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:20,160
Why would it be Dracula and not a ghost?

220
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:21,840
Dracula doesn't say fucking boo.

221
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:24,720
The past seven minutes of recording that we have done

222
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:28,400
have been, not a joke, a pretty good cross-section

223
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:31,080
of the experience we provide here.

224
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:32,800
Well, I thought this would be a good opportunity

225
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:34,680
for people at home to maybe get to know us

226
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:35,520
on a deeper level.

227
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:38,360
And Colin sent this in, and this is just kind of

228
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:40,680
a getting to know you icebreaker question.

229
00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:44,120
The original question here on some kind of web forum was,

230
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:47,680
what would be the worst torture to you?

231
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:50,160
And a woman named Laura answered,

232
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:53,480
you make me live in a cabin in the mountains in winter,

233
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:57,120
and every Saturday I would have to host a garage sale,

234
00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:01,840
and you would not give me any frozen or fresh vegetables

235
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:03,280
or fruits to eat.

236
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:08,280
That is the worst torture Laura can imagine.

237
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:12,360
So, I want to deposit to us,

238
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:15,120
what is the worst torture we can imagine?

239
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:16,680
I'm not gonna go with anything better

240
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:19,040
than Laura Williams-May, who, by the way,

241
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:23,280
put in her bio, Laura Williams-May, comma,

242
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:26,080
I offer alternative explanations and viewpoints.

243
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:26,920
Indeed.

244
00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:27,760
Good on ya.

245
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:31,440
And you can tell that because Laura has offered

246
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:34,960
almost 13,000 answers to questions

247
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:36,680
on whatever website this is.

248
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:40,040
They're almost all about how little she wants to be

249
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:41,920
in a cabin in the mountains in winter

250
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:44,520
and host a garage sale every Saturday.

251
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:46,480
Are these, do you think that these are three

252
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:48,760
like stacking tortures, or like,

253
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:49,800
you have to live in a cabin?

254
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:52,520
Oh man, this sucks, but I think I could get used to this.

255
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:53,360
Well, guess what?

256
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:56,320
This Saturday, you have to host a garage sale.

257
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:58,760
Oh man, well, every Saturday.

258
00:09:58,760 --> 00:09:59,600
God damn it.

259
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:01,920
Well, at least give me some fresh or frozen vegetables

260
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:04,000
or fruits to eat while I'm hosting the garage sale.

261
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Wait, why are you laughing?

262
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,880
I like that Laura has now,

263
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:11,520
that's all the vegetables and fruits, Laura.

264
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:13,120
Frozen or fresh, right?

265
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:13,960
That's it.

266
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:15,420
I mean, I guess dried.

267
00:10:15,420 --> 00:10:16,260
Canned.

268
00:10:16,260 --> 00:10:17,080
That's a different kind.

269
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:18,600
Canned, yeah.

270
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:19,440
Pickled.

271
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:20,280
Mushed.

272
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:21,520
She only likes them frozen or fresh.

273
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:22,760
Yeah, that's her deal, man.

274
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:25,720
It's one of the two opposite ends of the spectrum.

275
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:27,480
Okay, so here's what we do.

276
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:28,600
We take questions from listeners,

277
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:31,480
we answer them to the best of our ability.

278
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:33,520
We're gonna try to get through more than usual,

279
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:36,600
which is to say more than one, or maybe two.

280
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:37,440
Let's see how, let's do it.

281
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:41,520
During lunch, I accidentally dropped a few black beans

282
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:44,520
and they wrote, by the way, I feel like we never say this,

283
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:48,520
but if you have a question, you can send it to MBMBAM,

284
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:51,180
I know what you're thinking.

285
00:10:51,180 --> 00:10:53,900
Wow, a very bad nickname for a podcast.

286
00:10:53,900 --> 00:10:58,900
And yes, you are not wrong, MBMBAM at MaximumFun.org.

287
00:11:01,740 --> 00:11:03,240
Hey, another thing real quick.

288
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:05,660
Speaking of the bad name of our podcast,

289
00:11:05,660 --> 00:11:08,400
a listener pointed out on the YouTube comments,

290
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:11,560
cause I was watching our theme song by Montaigne,

291
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:13,040
cause my kids love it.

292
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:14,920
They pointed out that my brother, my brother and me

293
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:19,920
fits exactly with the cadence of the chorus.

294
00:11:20,900 --> 00:11:22,880
My brother, my brother and me.

295
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:24,600
Yeah, that's fun, that's good stuff.

296
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:25,720
It's fun.

297
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:29,200
Anyway, okay, so I accidentally dropped a few black beans

298
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:31,880
and they rolled under my cubicle into my coworkers

299
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:32,940
that sit straight across from me.

300
00:11:32,940 --> 00:11:34,960
This is already a nightmare.

301
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:37,640
And just, oh, for listeners at home, you might be confused.

302
00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:39,760
This didn't happen to Justin.

303
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:42,560
Justin is reading a question from a listener

304
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:44,000
and it's written in first person,

305
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,480
but Justin is merely the conduit.

306
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:48,500
Yeah, sometimes I'll just launch right into him

307
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:50,040
and you think I'm talking about myself

308
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:53,520
and then at the end I'm like doofus in Dakota or whatever.

309
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:56,520
Because you know Justin loves beans.

310
00:11:56,520 --> 00:11:58,080
Right, long time listeners will remember

311
00:11:58,080 --> 00:12:01,040
that Justin exclusively did eat beans for several years.

312
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:03,040
So I could understand the confusion there.

313
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:04,200
I used to be a bean boy.

314
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:05,040
I know.

315
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:05,860
Now I'm not anymore.

316
00:12:05,860 --> 00:12:06,920
No, now you're a bean man.

317
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:08,400
Too dense.

318
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:10,560
I have never met them.

319
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:13,500
I think they vacuum here on the weekends,

320
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:15,400
but this happened on Monday.

321
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:19,420
And by then they will be moldy, it may be so.

322
00:12:19,420 --> 00:12:22,560
Should I go pick up the beans when they are away

323
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:25,840
and risk being caught in the act and having to explain?

324
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:28,580
Should I just leave them be?

325
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:31,600
And leave them be.

326
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:33,320
There's no way to make this joke land.

327
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:34,160
Just leave them be.

328
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:37,000
It's not an audible sort of format, yeah.

329
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,620
And by the way, we'll do the jokes right here, thanks.

330
00:12:39,620 --> 00:12:42,840
This from being there, smell that in Minnesota.

331
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:44,880
I love, by the way, that in this question,

332
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:49,880
at no point is go over there while they're there

333
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:52,160
and explain an option provided.

334
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:54,560
Hey bro, see if it's a drop some bean beans over here,

335
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:56,160
gonna clear you out, one sec.

336
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:58,720
But here's the thing, if you're caught over there

337
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:02,080
and then you say, I'm over here because I dropped some beans

338
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:03,900
and they rolled under your cubicle,

339
00:13:03,900 --> 00:13:07,440
that is the most fishy explanation I've ever heard.

340
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:08,480
Yeah, that's a weird one.

341
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:10,240
They're definitely gonna think you've accidentally

342
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:13,160
dropped your stash, like in rent,

343
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:15,800
and now they are on the case.

344
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:16,640
Here's what I'm gonna say.

345
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:18,600
But if you say, if you go over there and say like,

346
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:20,320
I dropped some beans and they rolled under,

347
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:23,640
sorry about that, that's so wild that there's no way

348
00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:25,360
they're gonna think you're lying, right?

349
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:26,320
That's a good point.

350
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:27,160
Okay.

351
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:31,920
I'm gonna say, it's just a couple beans.

352
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:33,320
It's just a couple beans. That's what fucking

353
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:35,900
Jack and the Beanstalk thought, Griffin.

354
00:13:35,900 --> 00:13:38,680
Just a couple beans, and then pretty soon,

355
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:42,320
a giant falls and levels half the city.

356
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:46,320
But Jack didn't roll the beans accidentally.

357
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:48,800
Like Jack's mom was like, get these fucking beans

358
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:50,040
out of here, yeet!

359
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:51,920
And then a big Beanstalk came out,

360
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:54,120
and then we all know the rest of that story.

361
00:13:55,220 --> 00:13:57,200
Everybody got squished and died from it.

362
00:13:57,200 --> 00:13:59,280
But I would like to, just a side note,

363
00:13:59,280 --> 00:14:03,480
I know this is pretty, some Monday morning quarterbacking

364
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:05,280
on the author of Jack and the Beanstalk.

365
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:07,700
When the mysterious stranger said,

366
00:14:07,700 --> 00:14:10,760
trade me your cow for these magic beans,

367
00:14:10,760 --> 00:14:14,720
wouldn't anybody, no matter what level of curiosity

368
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:18,200
they have, anybody would say, in what way are they magic?

369
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:21,560
Yeah, what kind of spell do they contain?

370
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:25,200
Like, it's not like magic bean is like a category of bean.

371
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:26,960
They're like, oh, these are some of those magic beans

372
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:27,800
I've heard.

373
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:29,360
Because if the mysterious stranger was like,

374
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:33,800
oh, it'll grow a giant Beanstalk that you'll have to climb?

375
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:37,640
And then hide from a man-eating giant.

376
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:38,880
How did I get them, you ask?

377
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:39,920
Don't worry about that.

378
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:41,600
Give me your cow.

379
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:42,620
Give me that cow right now.

380
00:14:42,620 --> 00:14:47,120
Anyway, if I was in the cubicle across from this person

381
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:49,400
and I came over like, hey, a couple beans those

382
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:51,120
did roll under, and I looked down there,

383
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:53,880
I would be like, oh, it's fine, it's just a couple beans.

384
00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:57,960
If it was 50 beans, and I looked under my desk

385
00:14:57,960 --> 00:15:00,840
and there was a small pile of beans under there,

386
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:04,360
I would be like, yeah, you should get those.

387
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:05,440
You need to clean those up.

388
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:06,760
This is where I work.

389
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:08,040
I think about this a lot, right?

390
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:09,440
You do?

391
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:14,280
Well, no, it's just this idea of like, one is nothing.

392
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:17,000
And a million is a huge thing.

393
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:21,600
So there's some number, there's a fixed number, right?

394
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:23,800
Like if one bean is on the floor,

395
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:25,320
you probably wouldn't even notice.

396
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:28,360
If a hundred beans are in a small pyramid,

397
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:31,960
arranged perfectly, like sitting in your cubicle,

398
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:33,040
that's a huge deal.

399
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:34,000
That's a massive deal.

400
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:37,680
So there's some number in between one and 100 beans

401
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:39,600
where it becomes a topic,

402
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:41,520
where it becomes something that needs dealt with.

403
00:15:41,520 --> 00:15:42,560
I think I've got it.

404
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:43,840
I think I know the number.

405
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:44,680
Oh, really?

406
00:15:44,680 --> 00:15:45,520
You know the number?

407
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:46,400
I absolutely know the number.

408
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:48,360
I think it's five beans.

409
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:51,600
Okay, okay, wait, we'll shush that.

410
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:53,640
Shush, shush.

411
00:15:53,640 --> 00:15:54,880
If I look under my desk and there's-

412
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:55,720
It's your thesis.

413
00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:57,600
If there's one bean under my desk, oh, that's fun.

414
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:59,600
Two beans, oh, there's a couple beans down here.

415
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:01,160
Three beans, that's a few beans.

416
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:04,520
Four beans is like, should I do something about this?

417
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:06,440
Nah, it's just four beans.

418
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:08,840
Five beans is insane.

419
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:12,520
That's way too many beans to have under your desk.

420
00:16:12,520 --> 00:16:14,600
I don't think it's a binary, right?

421
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:19,080
Because I actually think a singular bean in the wild,

422
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:22,680
if I saw just a black bean under my desk,

423
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:26,520
how the fuck did one bean get there?

424
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:29,880
Okay, so there's like a feature, not a bug,

425
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:32,240
a feature of the human experience,

426
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:34,560
where it's like if something's small

427
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:36,920
and you maybe don't necessarily wanna think about it

428
00:16:36,920 --> 00:16:40,280
that much, you could filter out a bean.

429
00:16:40,280 --> 00:16:42,960
You could be like, I don't know,

430
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:46,280
my awareness is not going to engage with that one bean.

431
00:16:46,280 --> 00:16:47,440
I can't deal with that.

432
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:50,360
Aw, man, it must be nice not having ADHD, but go on.

433
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:54,280
I see that bean, it's my whole day.

434
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:56,720
What the fuck is that bean doing here?

435
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:58,640
I'm on the hunt.

436
00:16:58,640 --> 00:17:01,960
So that's one of our many bean questions we do.

437
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:04,080
We like to open things up with a bean segment.

438
00:17:04,080 --> 00:17:06,800
Yeah, and now there's another segment here

439
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:08,920
that I would say is much beloved

440
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:11,560
and everyone loves it when I do it.

441
00:17:11,560 --> 00:17:13,720
And I'll pull you aside, folks.

442
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:15,520
This next is gonna be a little bit loud,

443
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:17,800
but riddle me piss, boys.

444
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:19,600
And now let me pull you aside real quick

445
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:21,800
to say that we don't like this.

446
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:24,760
Well, there are some folks out there that do.

447
00:17:24,760 --> 00:17:27,920
Yeah, that's important context, but that we don't like it.

448
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:31,040
I'll give you guys, new listeners, a little explanation.

449
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:33,760
So there are people who will submit riddles

450
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:34,600
to the internet.

451
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:36,160
And every time they put that riddle up,

452
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:38,960
they think this is an absolute slam dunk.

453
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:41,320
But actually, as you will see from this riddle,

454
00:17:41,320 --> 00:17:42,160
this is not the case.

455
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:43,240
So this was submitted by- You probably don't need

456
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:44,080
to explain that.

457
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:45,000
I think people are gonna get

458
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,040
that the riddles aren't very good.

459
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:48,360
This is submitted by Kayla.

460
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:49,800
Thank you, Kayla.

461
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:54,520
If all Wibbles are Kriggles, all Borkens are Kwamblings.

462
00:17:54,520 --> 00:17:59,520
What? I already, I already don't want it.

463
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:04,520
If all Wibbles are Kriggles, all Borkens are Kwamblings,

464
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:08,720
excuse me, no Hoggles are Borkens,

465
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:11,200
and all Kriggles are Borkens,

466
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:14,280
is it true that all Borkens are Kriggles?

467
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:15,520
This sucks.

468
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:16,680
It sucks, Travis.

469
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:18,320
Do you wanna hear it again?

470
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:19,160
No, absolutely not.

471
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:20,000
I don't wanna hear it, got it, got it, got it.

472
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:20,820
I just wanna hear the-

473
00:18:20,820 --> 00:18:25,080
If all Wibbles are Kriggles, all Borkens are Kwamblings,

474
00:18:25,080 --> 00:18:29,600
no Hoggles are Borkens, and all Kriggles are Borkens,

475
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:32,240
is it true that all Borkens are Kriggles?

476
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:34,800
I can't, I try, actually, you know what's funny?

477
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:37,920
I tried to make my brain engage with it that time,

478
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:38,920
and it could, and it-

479
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:40,680
Slides right off, doesn't it?

480
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:42,560
It just slides, it just bounced out.

481
00:18:42,560 --> 00:18:44,420
It couldn't do it.

482
00:18:44,420 --> 00:18:46,120
So what was it, was it, no?

483
00:18:46,120 --> 00:18:48,640
Is, Juice, you say yes, I'll say no.

484
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:49,520
So that's- Okay, yes.

485
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:50,340
No.

486
00:18:50,340 --> 00:18:51,240
Griffin's right.

487
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:54,440
The answer, what they've actually written here is nope.

488
00:18:54,440 --> 00:18:57,720
So there you go, Borkens aren't Kriggles.

489
00:18:57,720 --> 00:18:58,560
Borkens aren't Kriggles.

490
00:18:58,560 --> 00:19:00,600
I guess what I'd say is Borkens aren't Kriggles.

491
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:01,440
Yep.

492
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:02,680
That's fantastic.

493
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:04,040
Jesus.

494
00:19:04,040 --> 00:19:06,740
We used to do Yahoo Answers on this show,

495
00:19:06,740 --> 00:19:11,360
but then that website got suffocated, killed,

496
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:14,300
got shut down and deleted off the internet.

497
00:19:14,300 --> 00:19:19,300
So this is a nascent segment, I would say, fresh.

498
00:19:20,300 --> 00:19:22,620
And it's very exciting where we approach

499
00:19:22,620 --> 00:19:24,560
the Wizard of the Cloud and we look

500
00:19:24,560 --> 00:19:26,680
at questions on WikiHow instead.

501
00:19:26,680 --> 00:19:30,600
And we learn things instead of, when Yahoo Answers,

502
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:33,560
it was just, you know, mystery atop a mystery.

503
00:19:33,560 --> 00:19:37,060
WikiHow is like a teacher.

504
00:19:37,060 --> 00:19:39,400
It's like a teacher that comes to teach you things.

505
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:41,000
And today's WikiHow is in-

506
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,280
Kind of like Nanny McPhee when you think about it.

507
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:44,720
It's basically Nanny McPhee.

508
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:46,860
Yeah, it's like Nanny McPhee, it teaches you lessons

509
00:19:46,860 --> 00:19:48,960
that maybe you don't even realize you're learning.

510
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:50,600
It's like Dr. Parnassus.

511
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:52,440
Just like Dr. Parnassus.

512
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:55,880
And Mr. Magorium, which I haven't seen, but okay.

513
00:19:56,960 --> 00:19:59,020
This is a subject that has near and dear to,

514
00:19:59,020 --> 00:20:01,440
I think, all our hearts, and it's how to mosh in a mosh pit.

515
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:02,280
Thank you.

516
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:07,040
I've always been curious about the level of violence

517
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:11,240
that you are supposed to bring to that sort of encounter.

518
00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:13,280
Yeah, I've always been worried I'll get in there

519
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:15,300
and fling myself at like a 10,

520
00:20:15,300 --> 00:20:16,840
and then they'll be like, whoa, dude.

521
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:18,720
Whoa, dude, fucking stop.

522
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:20,800
We're on like a three.

523
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:22,920
Fucking Slipknot on stage is like,

524
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:24,960
stop, stop the rock music.

525
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:26,520
Look at, that guy did a big hit.

526
00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:28,480
Get the fuck out of here.

527
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:31,740
Hey, this is a shared experience.

528
00:20:31,740 --> 00:20:32,580
Yeah.

529
00:20:32,580 --> 00:20:34,640
Mosh like that at home.

530
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:38,640
The first few things are preparatory, preparatory.

531
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:39,480
What?

532
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:40,540
Preparatory?

533
00:20:40,540 --> 00:20:41,380
Proprietary.

534
00:20:41,380 --> 00:20:42,720
Proprietary.

535
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:45,160
Griffin invented them just for this.

536
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:46,000
Step one.

537
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:49,280
These are patented.

538
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:51,520
Wear clothes you don't care about getting ruined.

539
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:53,360
Wear old worn clothes or a cheap outfit

540
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:54,180
you don't feel attached to.

541
00:20:54,180 --> 00:20:59,180
Clothing can get easily ripped or stained in a mosh pit.

542
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:00,240
Spelled how?

543
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:01,080
Spelled how?

544
00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:03,760
What if I wear my stained T-shirt?

545
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:04,600
There you go.

546
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:08,240
Yeah, that's a very, it's a risk that you can.

547
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:09,080
What's stained?

548
00:21:09,080 --> 00:21:09,920
I mean, it's a bummer.

549
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:12,920
It must be a bummer to go to a stained show

550
00:21:12,920 --> 00:21:14,520
from the band Stained,

551
00:21:14,520 --> 00:21:17,840
and then later you go to Wienerschnitzel

552
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:19,480
and you're having yourself a nice hot dog.

553
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:20,320
Yeah.

554
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:22,800
And then you layer it up with all your favorite topics.

555
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:24,560
Your moose stars, your cats ups.

556
00:21:24,560 --> 00:21:25,400
Everyone be quiet.

557
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:26,240
Okay.

558
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:28,600
And then you first fight, I got this.

559
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:30,360
Your first fight, catch your mustard,

560
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:32,080
squirts out onto your shirt.

561
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:34,520
And you look down at your new stained T-shirt

562
00:21:34,520 --> 00:21:36,000
that you bought at the concert earlier,

563
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:40,400
and you think, I can never express this to other people.

564
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:43,120
I'll never be able to express this situation.

565
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:44,840
Hey, what happened to that new show shirt you bought?

566
00:21:44,840 --> 00:21:46,280
The language hasn't evolved enough.

567
00:21:46,280 --> 00:21:47,160
Yeah, it's stained.

568
00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:48,000
Oh, I know.

569
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:48,920
Yeah, I was with you.

570
00:21:48,920 --> 00:21:50,440
No, no, no.

571
00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:52,640
It also said that the very next step

572
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:55,320
is actually don't bring big bottles of mustard

573
00:21:55,320 --> 00:21:56,520
into the mosh pit.

574
00:21:56,520 --> 00:21:57,360
That's fair.

575
00:21:57,360 --> 00:21:58,200
That's rude.

576
00:21:58,200 --> 00:22:01,320
Hey, as someone who grew up listening to music

577
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:02,400
in the 90s and stuff,

578
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:04,560
is Stained one of those bands that was like,

579
00:22:04,560 --> 00:22:06,160
sounded like really hardcore,

580
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:08,240
but was actually secretly a Christian rock band?

581
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:09,960
Christian, I don't know.

582
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:11,480
I think Puddle of Mud is.

583
00:22:11,480 --> 00:22:12,480
I don't know.

584
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:13,320
That feels right.

585
00:22:13,320 --> 00:22:15,200
All right, wear contact lenses instead of glasses.

586
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:19,440
Ovs, avoid wearing loose jewelry or accessories.

587
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:22,120
Partially, I think because you don't want to get choked,

588
00:22:22,120 --> 00:22:25,400
but also because of mosh bandits.

589
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:26,960
And we know.

590
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:28,600
Mosh mime women.

591
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:30,800
And I don't want to point fingers,

592
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:33,440
but I do remember one time Justin went to a rock concert

593
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:35,280
and came back with a beeper that wasn't his.

594
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:37,400
You want to talk about that?

595
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:38,720
Oh my God, what?

596
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:39,560
Do you not remember that?

597
00:22:39,560 --> 00:22:40,480
I don't remember this.

598
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:41,800
No, tell me more.

599
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:44,200
You went to a concert and you said you brought,

600
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:45,840
maybe this was a lie you told your brother.

601
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:47,800
Maybe you bought a beeper and you were embarrassed about it,

602
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:50,720
but you said you found a beeper on the floor

603
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:52,560
at a rock concert after a mosh pit

604
00:22:52,560 --> 00:22:55,560
and you brought it on home, which is fantastic.

605
00:22:55,560 --> 00:22:59,040
I know that one time I traded in enough Pepsi points

606
00:22:59,040 --> 00:23:00,360
to get a Mountain Dew beeper.

607
00:23:00,360 --> 00:23:01,200
Yes, that's it.

608
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:02,040
You did do that.

609
00:23:02,040 --> 00:23:02,880
That wasn't it.

610
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:04,720
I think this is a different situation though,

611
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:05,560
it sounds like.

612
00:23:05,560 --> 00:23:06,400
Okay, this seems like the kind of thing you would.

613
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:07,280
I don't remember this.

614
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:08,120
Oh my gosh.

615
00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:09,320
Make sure your shoes are tied.

616
00:23:09,320 --> 00:23:10,160
Fantastic.

617
00:23:10,160 --> 00:23:11,000
Yes.

618
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:12,240
All right, wait for the mosh.

619
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:13,280
This is joining the mosh pit.

620
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:14,280
This is where we,

621
00:23:14,280 --> 00:23:17,080
this is where the fucking rubber hits the road.

622
00:23:17,080 --> 00:23:18,800
Wait for the mosh pit to open up.

623
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:19,640
Yeah.

624
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:22,520
You'll know it's getting ready to start.

625
00:23:22,520 --> 00:23:24,440
Will there be a signal or?

626
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:25,960
Well, Travis, you'll know it's getting ready to start

627
00:23:25,960 --> 00:23:28,240
when the performer announces it or other concert goers

628
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:29,920
begin to make a clearing near the stage.

629
00:23:29,920 --> 00:23:31,560
Probably not the first one.

630
00:23:31,560 --> 00:23:33,160
Okay, everyone.

631
00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:34,600
Okay, everyone.

632
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:36,040
On three?

633
00:23:36,040 --> 00:23:37,880
It's me, Jeremy Slipknot.

634
00:23:37,880 --> 00:23:41,240
And I'm, I've got the red flag here.

635
00:23:41,240 --> 00:23:43,160
Wave, wave, begin.

636
00:23:43,160 --> 00:23:45,800
Begin the shoving.

637
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:48,120
There is a flaw with the second one though,

638
00:23:48,120 --> 00:23:49,920
which is if you're waiting for other people

639
00:23:49,920 --> 00:23:51,680
to start the moshing,

640
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:53,480
then what if everybody's waiting?

641
00:23:53,480 --> 00:23:55,520
You could be a mosh pioneer.

642
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:57,160
Right, yeah.

643
00:23:57,160 --> 00:23:58,160
Finish your drink.

644
00:23:58,160 --> 00:23:59,840
Don't bring a drink, duh.

645
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:01,760
Enter the mosh pit once you're ready.

646
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:03,880
Yeah, don't be surprised if people are pushing you

647
00:24:03,880 --> 00:24:06,760
and bumping you as you get to the edge of the circle.

648
00:24:06,760 --> 00:24:08,240
If you don't wanna dive right into the mosh pit,

649
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:09,720
stay at the edge of the pit for a little bit

650
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:11,640
and observe until you feel ready to enter.

651
00:24:11,640 --> 00:24:13,440
What's the number of people

652
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:16,400
standing on the perimeter of the mosh pit

653
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:19,160
staring intently at the people moshing

654
00:24:19,160 --> 00:24:21,080
that makes the people moshing feel uncomfortable?

655
00:24:21,080 --> 00:24:22,840
Like at what level do you,

656
00:24:22,840 --> 00:24:24,800
even though you're jumping and feeling the vibe

657
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:27,200
of the music and hurting and pushing

658
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:29,040
and shoving and hurting other people,

659
00:24:29,040 --> 00:24:30,880
are you like, I can't ignore the fact

660
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:34,640
that there are just like a dozen people looking at me.

661
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:36,720
Well, I think much like the bean question

662
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:37,560
we can start with,

663
00:24:37,560 --> 00:24:39,240
if it's just two people moshing,

664
00:24:39,240 --> 00:24:42,000
that's a romantic or at least very intense,

665
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:42,840
emotional experience. What is the sound

666
00:24:42,840 --> 00:24:43,680
of two people moshing?

667
00:24:43,680 --> 00:24:47,160
That's like a wedding's first dance there, right?

668
00:24:47,160 --> 00:24:49,920
You don't wanna, when two people are moshing together,

669
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:52,560
you don't wanna interrupt what they've got going.

670
00:24:52,560 --> 00:24:54,840
Now, as soon as a third party enters, right,

671
00:24:54,840 --> 00:24:56,920
now the energy I think is spread out as such

672
00:24:56,920 --> 00:24:59,800
that you need a fourth person to balance out

673
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:01,840
or else inevitably two of the three

674
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:03,480
are gonna start moshing together

675
00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:04,960
while the third is excluded.

676
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:06,600
Oh, God. Yeah.

677
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:10,240
You need to share the load with four,

678
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:12,920
at which point then it just is gonna escalate from there.

679
00:25:12,920 --> 00:25:15,400
That's gonna snowball for sure.

680
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:17,480
So yeah, start moshing, jump up and down in place,

681
00:25:17,480 --> 00:25:18,800
make a lap around the pit,

682
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:20,120
have both your hands open

683
00:25:20,120 --> 00:25:22,240
and your arms up at about chest level.

684
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:25,360
That's a cool look, that's probably not true.

685
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:26,840
Gently push people or bump into them.

686
00:25:26,840 --> 00:25:28,000
It's okay to push people around,

687
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:29,200
everyone's in the pit expecting it,

688
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:31,280
but remember, you're not there to hurt anyone.

689
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:33,080
Avoid elbowing anyone in the chest.

690
00:25:33,080 --> 00:25:35,960
As for some people, that can be quite sensitive,

691
00:25:35,960 --> 00:25:36,880
if not painful.

692
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:37,840
I would say most people.

693
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:40,440
Yeah, unless it's like fucking Colossus.

694
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:42,160
Most people getting elbowed in the chest

695
00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:43,160
is gonna feel that.

696
00:25:43,160 --> 00:25:44,640
Not gonna feel good.

697
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:46,920
Keep with the pace of the music and those around you.

698
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:49,520
Cool off with a breather during slow songs.

699
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:50,360
Oh, yeah.

700
00:25:50,360 --> 00:25:52,160
One of Stain's slow songs.

701
00:25:52,160 --> 00:25:54,240
And be prepared for- One of their ballads.

702
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:55,640
Be prepared for everyone to start moshing harder

703
00:25:55,640 --> 00:25:56,640
once the music picks up again.

704
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:57,560
Okay, cool.

705
00:25:57,560 --> 00:25:59,800
This is, I know you're thinking,

706
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:01,600
I'm definitely gonna hurt somebody.

707
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:03,000
Like somebody's going to get hurt here.

708
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:05,160
Not if you follow mosh pit etiquette, the next segment.

709
00:26:05,160 --> 00:26:07,240
One, stop and help anyone up should they fall.

710
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:08,080
Yes.

711
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:11,360
That's true in life as it is in mosh.

712
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:13,840
Yeah, if you see anyone fall down

713
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:15,360
and you're close to them,

714
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:17,840
it's a good thing to do in general,

715
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:22,840
regardless of whether or not a bunch of sweaty butt rock fans

716
00:26:23,720 --> 00:26:25,360
are out there jumping down nearby.

717
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:27,280
It does become especially important

718
00:26:27,280 --> 00:26:28,640
when that is happening.

719
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:29,480
Yeah.

720
00:26:29,480 --> 00:26:31,760
Pick up dropped items and hold them above your head.

721
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:32,880
Is this anyone's beeper?

722
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:33,720
Nope.

723
00:26:33,720 --> 00:26:34,560
Bye.

724
00:26:34,560 --> 00:26:38,560
I don't know how to transfer service on a beeper.

725
00:26:38,560 --> 00:26:41,040
So I guess I'll be answering Doug's pages.

726
00:26:41,040 --> 00:26:43,000
That was the biggest mystery to me.

727
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:45,680
If you see anyone's shoe or cell phone on the ground,

728
00:26:45,680 --> 00:26:46,520
stop and pick it up.

729
00:26:46,520 --> 00:26:48,040
The image that WikiHouse provided,

730
00:26:48,040 --> 00:26:51,040
which if you've never been to the website is always good,

731
00:26:51,040 --> 00:26:53,800
is somebody very happily holding a shoe above their head.

732
00:26:53,800 --> 00:26:56,600
And I like to think like, I'd get into the music, right?

733
00:26:56,600 --> 00:26:57,440
You all know me.

734
00:26:57,440 --> 00:26:58,880
I like to ride those vibes.

735
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:03,000
But if my shoe comes off, that's priority number one.

736
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:06,200
At the very least, it's gonna create a physical imbalance

737
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:07,040
in your body.

738
00:27:07,040 --> 00:27:08,080
You're gonna notice.

739
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:09,360
Yes.

740
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:11,080
Don't throw things in the mosh pit.

741
00:27:11,080 --> 00:27:11,920
Yes.

742
00:27:11,920 --> 00:27:12,760
Thank you.

743
00:27:12,760 --> 00:27:13,600
That's good.

744
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:14,440
Or the sand pit.

745
00:27:14,440 --> 00:27:16,720
And don't try to mosh with people who aren't in the pit.

746
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:18,160
Get in here.

747
00:27:18,160 --> 00:27:21,200
Yeah, don't try to start an ancillary mosh pit.

748
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:24,440
That's a weird, that is a weird sort of state of mind

749
00:27:24,440 --> 00:27:28,240
for the person who's like, I'm the edge of the mosh pit.

750
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:30,200
This mosh, no mosher.

751
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:32,440
I hate this mosh pit.

752
00:27:32,440 --> 00:27:33,280
I hate this mosh pit.

753
00:27:33,280 --> 00:27:34,640
I'm standing guard of you.

754
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:36,760
I won't let this, I won't let you pass.

755
00:27:36,760 --> 00:27:38,080
See, I thought that this was saying,

756
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:40,280
don't try to start a secondary mosh pit

757
00:27:40,280 --> 00:27:42,640
at a different location in the audience.

758
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:44,040
Like you're like, you know what?

759
00:27:44,040 --> 00:27:46,200
I don't like that mosh pit anymore.

760
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:47,880
They observe rules I don't like.

761
00:27:47,880 --> 00:27:48,920
I lost my shoe in there.

762
00:27:48,920 --> 00:27:50,240
No one held it above their head.

763
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:53,880
Hey, you, you're a beefy person.

764
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:55,120
Come mosh with me.

765
00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:55,960
You're on my team.

766
00:27:55,960 --> 00:27:56,800
What?

767
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:59,680
We're a rival mosh.

768
00:27:59,680 --> 00:28:01,040
I just really wanna watch the show.

769
00:28:01,040 --> 00:28:03,640
Begin jumping, we're a team now.

770
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:04,960
Squid game, hurt them.

771
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:07,280
Sick of them.

772
00:28:07,280 --> 00:28:08,240
Stank ironically.

773
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:10,800
Everyone, stank ironically.

774
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:13,280
Don't bother the venue staff in the pit.

775
00:28:13,280 --> 00:28:16,240
Oh man, you're shoving too hard.

776
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:18,200
Okay, I'll stop.

777
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:19,080
That's what they're there for.

778
00:28:19,080 --> 00:28:21,200
They're there to be, you know, in charge.

779
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:23,240
They're the parent of the mosh pit.

780
00:28:23,240 --> 00:28:25,040
You need to, hey, they're not doing it

781
00:28:25,040 --> 00:28:26,800
because they're mad at you.

782
00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:29,560
They're doing it because they care about you.

783
00:28:29,560 --> 00:28:33,840
Yeah, I gotta say, that's the last sort of tip here.

784
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:36,620
If I'm like in it, if I'm like,

785
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:39,920
if I'm skanking it to Hoobastank

786
00:28:39,920 --> 00:28:44,920
and really riding the vibe and doing a lot of pushing

787
00:28:45,280 --> 00:28:47,760
and someone tells me, hey, you need to stop.

788
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:50,160
I don't know that that sort of like,

789
00:28:51,400 --> 00:28:56,400
you know, primitive, just in my soul instinct to mosh

790
00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:59,120
is going to be able to be contained at that point.

791
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:00,640
Oh, that's so interesting, Griffin,

792
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:02,680
because if I was moshing at a concert

793
00:29:02,680 --> 00:29:04,440
and someone told me you need to stop,

794
00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:07,660
I would assume it was my inner monologue saying like,

795
00:29:07,660 --> 00:29:08,500
this is done now.

796
00:29:08,500 --> 00:29:11,440
This is not your thing, Travis.

797
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:13,560
Hey, Travis, I think you and I can both agree

798
00:29:13,560 --> 00:29:14,760
you're forcing this.

799
00:29:15,640 --> 00:29:17,880
The venue staff should not be there

800
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:21,120
to police the intensity of people's moshing.

801
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:23,920
They should be there for folks like me

802
00:29:23,920 --> 00:29:26,160
who they see me like very nervously start

803
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:30,560
walking in and they just grab me by the scruff of my neck

804
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:33,480
like no friend, no friend, this is not for you.

805
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:35,120
We actually have seating over here,

806
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:37,400
secret seating that we didn't tell anyone about,

807
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:40,800
but it looks like your human body might need it.

808
00:29:40,800 --> 00:29:41,640
Yeah.

809
00:29:41,640 --> 00:29:44,440
Hey, why don't you go buy a t-shirt, huh?

810
00:29:44,440 --> 00:29:48,100
A nice t-shirt and then maybe head on home.

811
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:52,380
This is a funny joke that somebody asking the questions,

812
00:29:52,380 --> 00:29:53,800
the community Q and A, what do I do

813
00:29:53,800 --> 00:29:55,440
if somebody starts doing the Macarena

814
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:57,360
whilst in the pit, goopity-goop?

815
00:29:57,360 --> 00:30:02,040
The community answered, nobody would do the Macarena

816
00:30:02,040 --> 00:30:03,280
in the mosh pit.

817
00:30:03,280 --> 00:30:06,160
Only moshing is done in a mosh pit.

818
00:30:06,160 --> 00:30:08,480
What if the person does what I used to do

819
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:09,440
at middle school dances,

820
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:10,640
which is they're too awkward to dance

821
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:12,160
so they just kind of sing along to the song

822
00:30:12,160 --> 00:30:13,840
in the middle of the dance floor.

823
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:14,680
Yeah.

824
00:30:14,680 --> 00:30:17,840
What if someone tries to make a big holding hand circle

825
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:18,680
in the mosh pit?

826
00:30:18,680 --> 00:30:20,320
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

827
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:22,120
What if they try to do that like,

828
00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:24,840
and now we're gonna highlight individual moshers.

829
00:30:24,840 --> 00:30:26,120
We've created a mosh circle.

830
00:30:26,120 --> 00:30:28,640
Now you get in there and let us watch you mosh by yourself.

831
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:29,660
Mosh train.

832
00:30:29,660 --> 00:30:31,200
Yes.

833
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:32,400
I'm into that.

834
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:34,440
Anyway, now we all know how to do this.

835
00:30:34,440 --> 00:30:38,040
So let's all go to a rock concert together.

836
00:30:38,040 --> 00:30:38,880
Yeah.

837
00:30:40,680 --> 00:30:41,680
Man, that'd be fun.

838
00:30:41,680 --> 00:30:42,760
That would be fucking fun.

839
00:30:42,760 --> 00:30:43,600
I'd like that.

840
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:44,440
I'd love to man.

841
00:30:44,440 --> 00:30:45,280
What's stopping us?

842
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:47,320
Well.

843
00:30:47,320 --> 00:30:48,160
A lot of stuff.

844
00:30:48,160 --> 00:30:49,200
Where to begin?

845
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:50,680
What do you mean, where to begin?

846
00:30:50,680 --> 00:30:52,440
Our bodies.

847
00:30:52,440 --> 00:30:56,520
Oh, this is actually good to talk about.

848
00:30:56,520 --> 00:30:59,240
We stop in the middle,

849
00:30:59,240 --> 00:31:00,920
like just when you're really starting to have fun.

850
00:31:00,920 --> 00:31:02,380
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.

851
00:31:02,380 --> 00:31:03,640
I don't know what you're thinking.

852
00:31:03,640 --> 00:31:04,520
This is an advice show.

853
00:31:04,520 --> 00:31:05,680
They've done very little advice.

854
00:31:05,680 --> 00:31:07,600
Well, we're hanging there.

855
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:10,080
There's a lot more coming.

856
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:11,560
I just around the bend.

857
00:31:11,560 --> 00:31:13,840
We take a break to do advertisements.

858
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:16,680
And what is great is if you can like frequent the businesses

859
00:31:16,680 --> 00:31:17,520
that we talked about.

860
00:31:17,520 --> 00:31:19,200
And we make it funny.

861
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:21,800
We're not like some of those other advertisers.

862
00:31:21,800 --> 00:31:22,640
Don't skip them.

863
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:23,840
It's not a robot or something.

864
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:26,080
It's really the guys that you love already.

865
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:28,600
And we're kind of like the Geico cavemen

866
00:31:28,600 --> 00:31:29,640
of podcast commercials.

867
00:31:29,640 --> 00:31:31,640
We're like, fuck, that's funny.

868
00:31:31,640 --> 00:31:32,480
Cool.

869
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:33,520
That's funny, yeah.

870
00:31:33,520 --> 00:31:34,360
Cool.

871
00:31:34,360 --> 00:31:37,120
So, oh, I begin this by I say,

872
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:39,080
let's, I'll go to the money then.

873
00:31:39,080 --> 00:31:42,080
It's better, it's better with you.

874
00:31:46,600 --> 00:31:48,280
Stamps.

875
00:31:48,280 --> 00:31:51,840
So for those of you at home, stamps are a thing

876
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:52,760
that you have to like.

877
00:31:52,760 --> 00:31:54,280
And they know about stamps.

878
00:31:54,280 --> 00:31:56,280
How do you know that?

879
00:31:56,280 --> 00:31:58,480
Well, we have to assume a base level of confidence.

880
00:31:58,480 --> 00:32:00,000
Okay, fair, fair, fair.

881
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,560
So if you've got a small business

882
00:32:01,560 --> 00:32:05,080
and you know there's nothing more available than your time,

883
00:32:05,080 --> 00:32:07,520
so stop wasting on trips to the post office

884
00:32:07,520 --> 00:32:10,600
and start wasting it on listening to our podcast.

885
00:32:10,600 --> 00:32:12,600
Stamps.com makes it easy to mail

886
00:32:12,600 --> 00:32:14,720
and ship right from your computer.

887
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:18,240

They will, I, now.

891
00:32:25,400 --> 00:32:26,520
They will do it.

892
00:32:26,520 --> 00:32:28,320
Now that I have committed them to it,

893
00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:31,320
they're working on a media player as we speak.

894
00:32:31,320 --> 00:32:32,160
So whether you're saying-

895
00:32:32,160 --> 00:32:34,360
They are trying to Tron Ben Gibbard today.

896
00:32:36,840 --> 00:32:40,200
That's our Stamps.com guarantee to you.

897
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:43,000
We are going to blast Ben Gibbard with a Tron gun.

898
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:44,000
Guys, stop it.

899
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:45,000
I said I would-

900
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:47,040
If you've ever wanted your computer

901
00:32:47,040 --> 00:32:48,880
to describe your girlfriend dying,

902
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:50,920
now the chance is here.

903
00:32:50,920 --> 00:32:51,760
It will happen.

904
00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:52,680
Do you have an old mattress?

905
00:32:52,680 --> 00:32:54,240
Now the world is 2021.

906
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:56,960
This disc on your back, yes, it's vinyl.

907
00:32:56,960 --> 00:32:57,800
You've guessed it.

908

you get a- Our-

923
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:27,080
My promo code.

924
00:33:27,080 --> 00:33:28,480
I called Stamps.com and I said,

925
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:30,640
can I please have a promo code?

926
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:31,880
And they said, yes, Travis,

927
00:33:31,880 --> 00:33:34,000
but don't let your brothers use it.

928
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:38,280
We should make an advertisement that's cool

929
00:33:38,280 --> 00:33:40,200
generate us three promo codes

930
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:42,440
to see which- Oh, oh, I like that.

931
00:33:42,440 --> 00:33:44,400
We can't come up with that up.

932
00:33:44,400 --> 00:33:46,200
My brother, all one word,

933
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:48,240
you get a special offer that includes a four week trial,

934
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:50,640
plus free postage and a digital scale.

935
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:52,680
No long-term commitments or contracts.

936
00:33:52,680 --> 00:33:53,520
Now I know you're wondering,

937
00:33:53,520 --> 00:33:54,760
sometimes that can be confusing.

938
00:33:54,760 --> 00:33:57,440
The digital scale means it has like a digital readout,

939
00:33:57,440 --> 00:34:02,040
not that it's like a computerized, like 3D scale.

940
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:03,000
I just wanna make sure that it's clear.

941
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:04,680
It's not made of lasers or something.

942
00:34:04,680 --> 00:34:06,080
So- Right, I think, yeah.

943
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:07,200
Okay, you don't know that.

944
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:08,320
It confuses me.

945
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:10,400
Just go to stamps.com, click on the microphone

946
00:34:10,400 --> 00:34:12,480
at the top of the homepage and type in my brother,

947
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:13,320
all one word.

948
00:34:13,320 --> 00:34:15,680
That's stamps.com, promo code, my brother.

949
00:34:15,680 --> 00:34:19,040
Stamps.com, never go to the post office again.

950
00:34:20,200 --> 00:34:21,360
Unless you work there.

951
00:34:21,360 --> 00:34:22,640
Unless you- Yeah.

952
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:25,880
Oh, can you imagine if you worked at the post office

953
00:34:25,880 --> 00:34:28,280
and the post office found out you had a stamps.com account?

954
00:34:28,280 --> 00:34:29,760
Oh boy.

955
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:32,840
I think it would go a little something like this.

956
00:34:32,840 --> 00:34:34,880
Hey Derek, you got a stamps.com account?

957
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:35,840
Uh, yeah.

958
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:38,440
Ah, cool, can you sort those packages please?

959
00:34:38,440 --> 00:34:40,760
He actually did the skit.

960
00:34:40,760 --> 00:34:43,160
Yeah, that's a good skit.

961
00:34:43,160 --> 00:34:44,640
Let me talk about this next one.

962
00:34:44,640 --> 00:34:46,200
Okay.

963
00:34:46,200 --> 00:34:47,040
It's ZipRecruiter.

964
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:47,880
Oh, okay.

965
00:34:47,880 --> 00:34:52,120
You know, I like to hand select things in my life.

966
00:34:52,120 --> 00:34:52,960
Like what?

967
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:55,560
No, like every day when I go into my,

968
00:34:57,720 --> 00:35:00,000
you know, toothpaste closet

969
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:01,280
and I pick the paste of the day.

970
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:02,120
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

971
00:35:02,120 --> 00:35:03,200
And what am I feeling like?

972
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:05,440
Baking soda, I'm baking soda peroxide, whatever.

973
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:06,600
Do you like the ones with the stripes?

974
00:35:06,600 --> 00:35:07,880
I need the whitening.

975
00:35:07,880 --> 00:35:09,720
Yeah, I like the ones with the stripes sometimes

976
00:35:09,720 --> 00:35:11,400
if I feel a little bit saucy.

977
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:13,480
But that's me, you know what I mean?

978
00:35:13,480 --> 00:35:16,080
I like to choose, it says in the ad copy,

979
00:35:16,080 --> 00:35:17,800
it says I can choose my own, so I guess I did.

980
00:35:17,800 --> 00:35:18,920
Yeah, sure.

981
00:35:18,920 --> 00:35:20,800
Yeah, don't let me off the leash again.

982
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:22,840
ZipRecruiter, that's what you get.

983
00:35:22,840 --> 00:35:25,440
You can do the same thing I do for toothpaste,

984
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:26,680
you can do it for hiring though.

985
00:35:26,680 --> 00:35:31,480
Oh, so if I wanted to like hire a toothpaste selector?

986
00:35:31,480 --> 00:35:33,840
You wouldn't think that it's a big draw, right?

987
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:36,840
I could choose the people that like get the job.

988
00:35:36,840 --> 00:35:38,400
No, no, no, that's not what ZipRecruiter means.

989
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:40,960
You can invite people to apply for the job.

990
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:44,120
It lets you pick your favorites from the best candidates.

991
00:35:44,120 --> 00:35:47,200
ZipRecruiter will send you qualified candidates

992
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:49,480
and you can easily invite your top choices

993
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:50,760
to apply for the job.

994
00:35:50,760 --> 00:35:51,600
You can't beat it.

995
00:35:51,600 --> 00:35:53,160
It's so hard finding the best people for the job

996
00:35:53,160 --> 00:35:55,640
and ZipRecruiter makes it easy.

997
00:35:55,640 --> 00:35:56,680
See for yourself.

998
00:35:56,680 --> 00:36:01,680
Go to ziprecruiter.com slash M-Y-B-R-O-T-H-E-R

999
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:03,640
to try ZipRecruiter for free.

1000
00:36:03,640 --> 00:36:08,080
That's ziprecruiter.com slash M-Y-B-R-O-T-H-E-R.

1001
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:12,120
I'm Lisa Hanawalt.

1002
00:36:12,120 --> 00:36:13,240
And I'm Emily Heller.

1003
00:36:13,240 --> 00:36:14,960
Nine years ago, we started a podcast

1004
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:17,080
to try and learn something new every episode.

1005
00:36:17,080 --> 00:36:19,800
Things have gone a little off the rails since then.

1006
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:21,080
Tune in to hear about.

1007
00:36:21,080 --> 00:36:22,800
Low stakes neighborhood drama.

1008
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:23,920
Gardening.

1009
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:27,240
The sordid, nasty underbelly of the horse girl lifestyle.

1010
00:36:27,240 --> 00:36:28,360
Hot sauce.

1011
00:36:28,360 --> 00:36:31,440
Addiction to TV and sweaty takes on celebrities.

1012
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:32,640
Celebrity culture.

1013
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:34,920
And the weirdest, grossest stuff you can find

1014
00:36:34,920 --> 00:36:36,680
on wikipedia.org.

1015
00:36:36,680 --> 00:36:39,480
We'll read all of it, no matter how gross.

1016
00:36:39,480 --> 00:36:41,280
There's something for everyone on our podcast,

1017
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:42,400
Baby Geniuses.

1018
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:44,800
Hosted by us, two horny adult idiots.

1019
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:46,680
Hang out with us as we try and fail

1020
00:36:46,680 --> 00:36:48,480
to retain any knowledge at all.

1021
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:51,160
Every other week on Maximum Fun.

1022
00:36:51,160 --> 00:36:55,160
Baby Geniuses, tell us something we don't know.

1023
00:36:57,840 --> 00:36:59,880
Hey Griff, do you have another, do you want to start?

1024
00:36:59,880 --> 00:37:00,720
Do you want to start a bit?

1025
00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:01,560
I don't know.

1026
00:37:01,560 --> 00:37:02,560
And this is a thing Justin likes to do

1027
00:37:02,560 --> 00:37:03,800
where he basically starts things

1028
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:06,880
and then he really puts me in the toilet.

1029
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:08,960
Yeah Juice, here comes a segment that I've prepared

1030
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:10,360
and worked really hard on.

1031
00:37:10,360 --> 00:37:11,880
Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba.

1032
00:37:11,880 --> 00:37:13,280
Okay, now what you've heard there

1033
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:15,480
is the opening strains to the intro music

1034
00:37:15,480 --> 00:37:17,240
to a bit within a bit.

1035
00:37:17,240 --> 00:37:18,400
This is called the Munch Squad,

1036
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:20,040
where I talk about, well you'll see.

1037
00:37:20,040 --> 00:37:22,840
Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba.

1038
00:37:22,840 --> 00:37:24,800
There's a call and response section of this.

1039
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:32,000
Da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da.

1040
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:34,400
I wanna Munch Squad.

1041
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:36,440
Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba.

1042
00:37:36,440 --> 00:37:39,240
I want to Munch Squad.

1043
00:37:39,240 --> 00:37:42,080
Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba.

1044
00:37:42,080 --> 00:37:43,240
Toronto!

1045
00:37:43,240 --> 00:37:45,200
Now, welcome Munch Squad, it's a podcast

1046
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:46,880
within a podcast where I profile

1047
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:51,040
the latest and greatest in brand eating.

1048
00:37:51,040 --> 00:37:53,280
That means like fast food,

1049
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:55,920
or brand eating, I think really covers it.

1050
00:37:55,920 --> 00:37:57,400
Yeah.

1051
00:37:57,400 --> 00:37:58,560
When you eat a brand.

1052
00:37:58,560 --> 00:37:59,960
Guys ever heard of Culver's?

1053
00:37:59,960 --> 00:38:01,940
Oh yeah, we got Culver's here.

1054
00:38:01,940 --> 00:38:02,780
You got Culver's here?

1055
00:38:02,780 --> 00:38:03,620
Oh yeah, I like Culver's.

1056
00:38:03,620 --> 00:38:05,040
I got big news for you, bud.

1057
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:08,120
The Curda Burger.

1058
00:38:08,120 --> 00:38:09,160
What?

1059
00:38:09,160 --> 00:38:10,160
Everyone say it once.

1060
00:38:10,160 --> 00:38:11,400
No, I don't know what you said.

1061
00:38:11,400 --> 00:38:12,240
I can't.

1062
00:38:12,240 --> 00:38:13,060
Curda Burger? Curda Burger?

1063
00:38:13,060 --> 00:38:14,760
Sorry, just say, just say, Curda Burger.

1064
00:38:14,760 --> 00:38:15,600
Curda Burger.

1065
00:38:15,600 --> 00:38:17,400
It's very, very egg-nuggy.

1066
00:38:17,400 --> 00:38:19,560
Curda Burger. Curda Burger.

1067
00:38:19,560 --> 00:38:20,960
Curda Burger.

1068
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:24,200
That was a very funny joke that Culver's did,

1069
00:38:24,200 --> 00:38:27,080
which is one of the most irritating things that anybody does

1070
00:38:27,080 --> 00:38:28,920
where it makes up a fake item

1071
00:38:28,920 --> 00:38:31,220
to get social media to talk about it.

1072
00:38:31,220 --> 00:38:33,160
They did it with the Curda Burger.

1073
00:38:33,160 --> 00:38:38,160
And then that is a, it's a burger, huh?

1074
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:41,320
It's a Culver Butter Burger.

1075
00:38:41,320 --> 00:38:43,160
Now that sounds different.

1076
00:38:43,160 --> 00:38:45,000
It's a less Culver Butter Burger,

1077
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:48,640
the top with golden fried cheese or curds.

1078
00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:51,200
It's a cheese-cored Curd Burger or a Curda Burger.

1079
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:52,040
Oh, I see.

1080
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:54,440
So they did this as a joke.

1081
00:38:54,440 --> 00:38:55,280
Ah.

1082
00:38:55,280 --> 00:38:57,040
It's a Butter Burger with curd on top.

1083
00:38:57,040 --> 00:38:57,860
Okay.

1084
00:38:57,860 --> 00:38:58,700
The Curda Burger.

1085
00:38:58,700 --> 00:38:59,540
Okay.

1086
00:38:59,540 --> 00:39:00,360
I get it.

1087
00:39:00,360 --> 00:39:04,900
But for once, someone did the right thing.

1088
00:39:04,900 --> 00:39:05,740
Sued them.

1089
00:39:05,740 --> 00:39:07,720
And looked at the social media response.

1090
00:39:07,720 --> 00:39:11,480
As we know, I'm sure, fucking uproarious

1091
00:39:11,480 --> 00:39:12,640
to this April Fool's gag.

1092
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:13,480
Yeah.

1093
00:39:13,480 --> 00:39:16,000
And the people were so incensed

1094
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:19,680
that the idea of Curda Burger had been created,

1095
00:39:19,680 --> 00:39:22,400
but the physical manifestation of Curda Burger

1096
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:23,320
was denied to them.

1097
00:39:23,320 --> 00:39:24,160
Right.

1098
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:25,640
That they realized, Culver's realized

1099
00:39:25,640 --> 00:39:27,480
it was their moral obligation

1100
00:39:28,680 --> 00:39:30,600
to bring the menu item to life.

1101
00:39:30,600 --> 00:39:34,040
For one day only on National Cheese Curd Day,

1102
00:39:34,040 --> 00:39:36,840
which is, as we all know, say it together.

1103
00:39:36,840 --> 00:39:40,400
November 17th.

1104
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:41,240
October 15th.

1105
00:39:41,240 --> 00:39:42,080
Yeah.

1106
00:39:42,080 --> 00:39:42,900
I said it.

1107
00:39:42,900 --> 00:39:43,740
Sorry, there was a lag.

1108
00:39:43,740 --> 00:39:44,580
October 15th.

1109
00:39:44,580 --> 00:39:46,240
They're launching the Curda Burger.

1110
00:39:46,240 --> 00:39:48,320
We got a delicious crown of golden fried cheese.

1111
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:49,160
Damn.

1112
00:39:49,160 --> 00:39:50,120
Makes this burger one of a kind.

1113
00:39:50,120 --> 00:39:52,280
The cheese crown, which is-

1114
00:39:52,280 --> 00:39:53,120
Which is a good thing.

1115
00:39:53,120 --> 00:39:54,620
One of the names you could choose.

1116
00:39:54,620 --> 00:39:55,460
They chose that one.

1117
00:39:55,460 --> 00:39:56,300
Yeah.

1118
00:39:56,300 --> 00:39:57,120
The cheese crown.

1119
00:39:57,120 --> 00:39:59,240
I believe that was what our Lord and Savior,

1120
00:39:59,240 --> 00:40:00,960
Jesus Christ, had to put on the crust.

1121
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:02,000
Travis, Travis.

1122
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:03,320
I think you mean cheesy crust.

1123
00:40:03,320 --> 00:40:04,280
Cheesy crust.

1124
00:40:04,280 --> 00:40:05,120
I'm sorry.

1125
00:40:05,120 --> 00:40:06,120
Cheesy crust.

1126
00:40:06,120 --> 00:40:09,360
We're incredibly proud of our, this is an answer.

1127
00:40:09,360 --> 00:40:10,980
This is, if you hear me talking

1128
00:40:10,980 --> 00:40:13,400
in the voice of a creative type,

1129
00:40:13,400 --> 00:40:16,000
this is Quinn Adkins,

1130
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:17,660
Culver's Director of Menu Development.

1131
00:40:17,660 --> 00:40:18,960
Quinn Adkins.

1132
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:21,160
The delicious crown of golden fried cheese

1133
00:40:21,160 --> 00:40:23,680
is what makes this burger one of a kind.

1134
00:40:23,680 --> 00:40:26,720
The cheese crown is made up of a blend of yellow

1135
00:40:26,720 --> 00:40:28,300
and white cheddar cheese curds,

1136
00:40:28,300 --> 00:40:31,080
all surrounded by crispy seasoned breadcrumbs.

1137
00:40:31,080 --> 00:40:34,120
We're incredibly proud of our Wisconsin cheese curds,

1138
00:40:34,120 --> 00:40:37,260
which is why they've slapped them into a butter burger,

1139
00:40:37,260 --> 00:40:39,320
and our relationship with Wisconsin dairy.

1140
00:40:39,320 --> 00:40:41,120
So the Curda Burger is just another way

1141
00:40:41,120 --> 00:40:43,240
to showcase our trademark quality,

1142
00:40:43,240 --> 00:40:45,780
and Wisconsin roots.

1143
00:40:45,780 --> 00:40:48,020
Beyond the burger itself,

1144
00:40:48,020 --> 00:40:51,120
the way the Curda Burger came into existence

1145
00:40:51,120 --> 00:40:52,560
is a story worth telling.

1146
00:40:52,560 --> 00:40:54,600
It all began on April Fool's Day

1147
00:40:54,600 --> 00:40:56,500
with a prank we posted on social media.

1148
00:40:56,500 --> 00:40:58,440
But when guests made it clear,

1149
00:40:58,440 --> 00:41:00,920
they wanted it to be a real menu item,

1150
00:41:00,920 --> 00:41:03,780
which was such a surprise, I think, to them.

1151
00:41:03,780 --> 00:41:07,200
They in no way were backdoor announcing a new menu item

1152
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:08,040
to see the response.

1153
00:41:08,040 --> 00:41:08,880
For sure not.

1154
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:09,700
Who would do that?

1155
00:41:09,700 --> 00:41:11,400
It completely caught them by surprise.

1156
00:41:11,400 --> 00:41:13,600
Justin, can I ask you a question legitimately?

1157
00:41:13,600 --> 00:41:15,760
I'm trying to find a picture of this thing.

1158
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:17,240
What's the joke?

1159
00:41:17,240 --> 00:41:19,200
What was the joke?

1160
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:21,000
It's so funny that they would put cheese.

1161
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:23,120
I know, this is what,

1162
00:41:23,120 --> 00:41:27,280
everyone's doing things that are exponentially nastier.

1163
00:41:27,280 --> 00:41:29,500
The whole world is nastier than this.

1164
00:41:29,500 --> 00:41:31,400
It's almost sort of quaint.

1165
00:41:31,400 --> 00:41:33,020
It's elegant.

1166
00:41:33,020 --> 00:41:36,520
Like that they are coming out with the Curda Burger

1167
00:41:36,520 --> 00:41:37,640
and expecting us to be like,

1168
00:41:37,640 --> 00:41:39,820
you did what? You're wild.

1169
00:41:39,820 --> 00:41:40,660
You what?

1170
00:41:40,660 --> 00:41:41,500
I gotta give,

1171
00:41:42,840 --> 00:41:45,240
I'm always dunking on people

1172
00:41:45,240 --> 00:41:47,200
who answer the questions for QSR,

1173
00:41:47,200 --> 00:41:50,360
which is sort of my hookup for this information.

1174
00:41:50,360 --> 00:41:54,320
But on this one, I do have to call QSR itself out

1175
00:41:54,320 --> 00:41:55,960
on the question they've decided to ask here,

1176
00:41:55,960 --> 00:41:56,920
which to be fair,

1177
00:41:56,920 --> 00:41:57,880
coming up with questions to ask

1178
00:41:57,880 --> 00:42:00,040
about the Curda Burger can't be easy.

1179
00:42:00,040 --> 00:42:04,320
QSR asks, why does it work from a flavor perspective?

1180
00:42:05,360 --> 00:42:06,200
What do you think, motherfucker?

1181
00:42:06,200 --> 00:42:08,000
It's fried cheese on a burger.

1182
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:10,440
It's a fried cheese on a burger, dipshit.

1183
00:42:10,440 --> 00:42:13,840
It's not like a complex fried cheese on a burger.

1184
00:42:13,840 --> 00:42:16,000
It's cheese and meat, but fried.

1185
00:42:17,360 --> 00:42:20,400
From a flavor perspective, the Curda Burger,

1186
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:23,960
which by the way, it fails in almost every other respect.

1187
00:42:23,960 --> 00:42:25,960
Like it is not pleasant to look upon.

1188
00:42:25,960 --> 00:42:26,800
Or say.

1189
00:42:26,800 --> 00:42:28,880
Let's talk about it just from a flavor perspective.

1190
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:30,960
The Curda Burger is an evolution

1191
00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:32,600
of our classic Burger Burger,

1192
00:42:32,600 --> 00:42:35,200
but adds an additional savory component

1193
00:42:35,200 --> 00:42:37,560
with our signature blend of herbs and spices,

1194
00:42:37,560 --> 00:42:40,760
a textural contrast with the fried crown

1195
00:42:40,760 --> 00:42:43,680
and a tremendous visual dynamic.

1196
00:42:43,680 --> 00:42:45,480
So from a flavor perspective,

1197
00:42:45,480 --> 00:42:48,560
it adds a tremendous visual dynamic.

1198
00:42:49,440 --> 00:42:50,520
I know what you're wondering, guys,

1199
00:42:50,520 --> 00:42:51,800
because it's the same question I had.

1200
00:42:51,800 --> 00:42:53,720
What was the R&D process like?

1201
00:42:53,720 --> 00:42:55,480
How many attempts did it take to get it right,

1202
00:42:55,480 --> 00:42:57,060
fried cheese on a hamburger?

1203
00:42:57,060 --> 00:43:01,520
This, says Quinn, was a personal project of love.

1204
00:43:01,520 --> 00:43:02,340
Was it?

1205
00:43:02,340 --> 00:43:04,080
It developed in three months,

1206
00:43:04,080 --> 00:43:06,200
starting in late May after the menu team

1207
00:43:06,200 --> 00:43:09,560
saw all the attention the April Fool's message received.

1208
00:43:09,560 --> 00:43:11,080
So just to be clear,

1209
00:43:11,080 --> 00:43:14,240
it took you two months to read your mentions?

1210
00:43:14,240 --> 00:43:15,680
I mean, I get it.

1211
00:43:15,680 --> 00:43:17,320
There's probably not a lot of like,

1212
00:43:17,320 --> 00:43:18,720
culvert discussion on there,

1213
00:43:18,720 --> 00:43:21,220
but it seems like a long time to realize like,

1214
00:43:21,220 --> 00:43:22,860
hey, people really want this burger.

1215
00:43:22,860 --> 00:43:25,080
The extraordinary development speed

1216
00:43:25,080 --> 00:43:27,840
was made possible by the talent and dedication of our team,

1217
00:43:27,840 --> 00:43:29,640
along with the strength of our relationships

1218
00:43:29,640 --> 00:43:32,200
with our manufacturing and supplier network

1219
00:43:32,200 --> 00:43:34,040
without our strategic supplier.

1220
00:43:34,040 --> 00:43:35,000
You want more cheese?

1221
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:35,840
Okay.

1222
00:43:35,840 --> 00:43:36,680
All right.

1223
00:43:36,680 --> 00:43:37,640
Yeah, the logistics of that.

1224
00:43:37,640 --> 00:43:38,760
In this economy?

1225
00:43:38,760 --> 00:43:39,600
Really?

1226
00:43:39,600 --> 00:43:40,420
Okay.

1227
00:43:40,420 --> 00:43:41,260
How much should it cost?

1228
00:43:41,260 --> 00:43:42,120
A hundred dollars?

1229
00:43:42,120 --> 00:43:43,920
That's too much.

1230
00:43:43,920 --> 00:43:45,120
Five dollars?

1231
00:43:45,120 --> 00:43:45,960
Sounds good.

1232
00:43:45,960 --> 00:43:47,440
Guests have a high,

1233
00:43:47,440 --> 00:43:48,680
for this item in particular,

1234
00:43:48,680 --> 00:43:50,960
we wanted to wow our guests.

1235
00:43:50,960 --> 00:43:53,960
So we designed a burger that went above and beyond.

1236
00:43:53,960 --> 00:43:55,300
And this is where Quinn,

1237
00:43:55,300 --> 00:43:57,800
like people are always using team language.

1238
00:43:57,800 --> 00:43:59,580
I've never seen anyone do this

1239
00:43:59,580 --> 00:44:01,120
in one of these press releases.

1240
00:44:01,120 --> 00:44:02,580
Quinn then says,

1241
00:44:02,580 --> 00:44:06,860
when executing my vision for the curder burger,

1242
00:44:06,860 --> 00:44:08,820
I created a list of must haves,

1243
00:44:08,820 --> 00:44:11,140
including functionality of design

1244
00:44:11,140 --> 00:44:12,380
that reflected what we deliver

1245
00:44:12,380 --> 00:44:13,760
with our current cheese curds.

1246
00:44:13,760 --> 00:44:17,060
So both the yellow and white curds were evident.

1247
00:44:17,060 --> 00:44:19,780
Optimizing the eating experience of the burger.

1248
00:44:19,780 --> 00:44:22,540
So the cheese crown not only is visually appealing,

1249
00:44:22,540 --> 00:44:25,860
but also holds together after taking a bite.

1250
00:44:25,860 --> 00:44:29,240
Three, perfecting the size and weight of the crown

1251
00:44:29,240 --> 00:44:31,660
so it can be consistently prepared

1252
00:44:31,660 --> 00:44:33,580
to the highest quality in restaurant.

1253
00:44:33,580 --> 00:44:36,180
And a high ceiling in the garage so that I can,

1254
00:44:36,180 --> 00:44:37,540
oh, no, wait, sorry.

1255
00:44:37,540 --> 00:44:40,720
That's for my must haves for the new house I'm going to buy

1256
00:44:40,720 --> 00:44:43,220
after the curder burger comes out.

1257
00:44:43,220 --> 00:44:45,460
Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry.

1258
00:44:45,460 --> 00:44:46,460
But here's the wild thing.

1259
00:44:46,460 --> 00:44:48,020
All this work, all of it,

1260
00:44:49,140 --> 00:44:50,580
for the curder burger,

1261
00:44:50,580 --> 00:44:52,340
which is available for one day.

1262
00:44:53,340 --> 00:44:54,700
Can you imagine?

1263
00:44:54,700 --> 00:44:56,220
This is like a corpse flower.

1264
00:44:56,220 --> 00:44:57,060
Yeah.

1265
00:44:57,060 --> 00:44:57,880
Right?

1266
00:44:57,880 --> 00:44:58,720
Yeah.

1267
00:44:58,720 --> 00:44:59,560
Like all this work,

1268
00:44:59,560 --> 00:45:03,540
in one day of, who cares if it's consistent?

1269
00:45:03,540 --> 00:45:04,720
It's one day.

1270
00:45:04,720 --> 00:45:05,980
Buy it or don't.

1271
00:45:05,980 --> 00:45:06,820
You know what I mean?

1272
00:45:06,820 --> 00:45:07,660
It's the worst.

1273
00:45:07,660 --> 00:45:08,480
That's the dedication to quality I can say about it.

1274
00:45:08,480 --> 00:45:09,320
I'll tell you what, Justin,

1275
00:45:09,320 --> 00:45:10,940
you've really ruined me on this.

1276
00:45:10,940 --> 00:45:14,080
After talking about the absolute R&D mad lad

1277
00:45:14,080 --> 00:45:17,060
that worked at Wendy's that worked on a new fry recipe

1278
00:45:17,060 --> 00:45:18,840
for two and a half years.

1279
00:45:18,840 --> 00:45:22,240
And it's hard for me now to take anybody's R&D seriously

1280
00:45:22,240 --> 00:45:24,580
when they're like three months we put into this.

1281
00:45:24,580 --> 00:45:25,740
I'm like, that's nothing.

1282
00:45:25,740 --> 00:45:26,580
That's nothing.

1283
00:45:26,580 --> 00:45:28,020
You're a child.

1284
00:45:28,020 --> 00:45:30,380
Talk to me when you've spent two and a half years

1285
00:45:30,380 --> 00:45:31,220
figuring out how to make french fries.

1286
00:45:31,220 --> 00:45:32,740
That's all I think about.

1287
00:45:32,740 --> 00:45:37,300
I want this R&D to submerge you into a pool of madness.

1288
00:45:37,300 --> 00:45:38,140
Yes.

1289
00:45:38,140 --> 00:45:40,500
From which you might never return.

1290
00:45:40,500 --> 00:45:43,740
I want this to be your Mr. Holland's opus.

1291
00:45:43,740 --> 00:45:45,920
It tastes better to me when you don't return

1292
00:45:45,920 --> 00:45:47,180
from the madness pool.

1293
00:45:47,180 --> 00:45:48,100
Yes.

1294
00:45:48,100 --> 00:45:49,460
Speaking of Wendy's fries,

1295
00:45:49,460 --> 00:45:51,060
if I can just pivot briefly,

1296
00:45:51,060 --> 00:45:54,340
this week, Carl Laredo, the CMO at Wendy's,

1297
00:45:54,340 --> 00:45:56,420
posted a picture of him and his family

1298
00:45:56,420 --> 00:45:58,580
enjoying some new Wendy's fries.

1299
00:45:58,580 --> 00:46:00,280
And the text of this photo is,

1300
00:46:00,280 --> 00:46:03,060
the whole family loves Wendy's new hot and crispy fries.

1301
00:46:03,060 --> 00:46:04,180
Really, Carl?

1302
00:46:04,180 --> 00:46:05,580
Except for Doug. What a shock.

1303
00:46:05,580 --> 00:46:06,860
Not pictured.

1304
00:46:06,860 --> 00:46:09,540
My shithead son, Doug, hates my fries.

1305
00:46:09,540 --> 00:46:11,180
He's out.

1306
00:46:11,180 --> 00:46:12,780
The company that puts food on your table

1307
00:46:12,780 --> 00:46:14,740
put food on your table and you enjoyed it?

1308
00:46:14,740 --> 00:46:17,780
I'll tell you what though, those fries are fucking good.

1309
00:46:17,780 --> 00:46:20,900
And they survived the drive home in a very-

1310
00:46:20,900 --> 00:46:23,220
Listen, I noticed too, Trav.

1311
00:46:23,220 --> 00:46:25,140
I didn't even realize we were getting them.

1312
00:46:25,140 --> 00:46:27,540
And then Sydney and I both ate some fries

1313
00:46:27,540 --> 00:46:29,020
and we're like, damn.

1314
00:46:29,020 --> 00:46:29,860
What's up?

1315
00:46:29,860 --> 00:46:30,680
Yeah.

1316
00:46:30,680 --> 00:46:31,520
What's up?

1317
00:46:31,520 --> 00:46:32,380
These fries, they're good.

1318
00:46:32,380 --> 00:46:33,220
Okay, Carl, you're right.

1319
00:46:33,220 --> 00:46:34,420
You did, Carl.

1320
00:46:34,420 --> 00:46:36,140
I don't think you and your family are lying, Carl.

1321
00:46:36,140 --> 00:46:36,980
They're good fries.

1322
00:46:36,980 --> 00:46:37,800
They're good fries.

1323
00:46:37,800 --> 00:46:38,700
I would never say that.

1324
00:46:38,700 --> 00:46:40,100
Not about Doris.

1325
00:46:40,100 --> 00:46:40,940
Not about-

1326
00:46:40,940 --> 00:46:41,760
I'd say it about-

1327
00:46:41,760 --> 00:46:42,600
Robethany.

1328
00:46:42,600 --> 00:46:43,460
I'd say it about Doug.

1329
00:46:43,460 --> 00:46:45,300
Doug's a piece of shit.

1330
00:46:45,300 --> 00:46:47,140
I don't know Carl's children's names,

1331
00:46:47,140 --> 00:46:48,740
but I'm just going to guess it's Robethany.

1332
00:46:48,740 --> 00:46:49,920
Robethany and Doug.

1333
00:46:52,540 --> 00:46:54,100
Don't you?

1334
00:46:54,100 --> 00:46:56,440
This is Carl Laredo's son, Doug Jr.

1335
00:46:58,260 --> 00:47:00,060
He's a real twisted ride.

1336
00:47:00,060 --> 00:47:02,200
He's the junior of a different Doug.

1337
00:47:03,180 --> 00:47:05,240
Just a Doug that Carl knows.

1338
00:47:05,240 --> 00:47:09,220
Is this named after my barber?

1339
00:47:11,060 --> 00:47:13,580
He reminds me of my road dog, Doug.

1340
00:47:13,580 --> 00:47:15,420
He's a great barber.

1341
00:47:15,420 --> 00:47:17,260
I don't go there anymore.

1342
00:47:17,260 --> 00:47:18,280
My name's Carl Laredo.

1343
00:47:18,280 --> 00:47:20,180
This is my son, Dave Thomas Jr.

1344
00:47:20,180 --> 00:47:24,260
We don't cut corners here in my family.

1345
00:47:25,780 --> 00:47:27,580
Does Wendy's still make square patties?

1346
00:47:27,580 --> 00:47:28,860
They don't, do they?

1347
00:47:28,860 --> 00:47:32,000
Trav, can I charge you with getting a Curderburger?

1348
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:33,220
If you've got Culver's around you,

1349
00:47:33,220 --> 00:47:35,500
will you get a Curderburger and gram it?

1350
00:47:35,500 --> 00:47:36,340
Just gram it.

1351
00:47:36,340 --> 00:47:37,260
Yeah, I'll put it on the gram.

1352
00:47:37,260 --> 00:47:39,300
Yeah, how incensed would you be

1353
00:47:39,300 --> 00:47:42,140
if you went into a non-participating Culver's-

1354
00:47:42,140 --> 00:47:42,980
On this one day.

1355
00:47:42,980 --> 00:47:45,660
On October 15th and know it's slipping.

1356
00:47:45,660 --> 00:47:47,540
They're like, I don't know, let me look in the back.

1357
00:47:47,540 --> 00:47:49,540
And you're like, I could be eating it now.

1358
00:47:49,540 --> 00:47:50,700
This is the one chance I have.

1359
00:47:50,700 --> 00:47:53,500
Could I get 30 of them and 29 of them are frozen?

1360
00:47:53,500 --> 00:47:54,560
Is that possible?

1361
00:47:55,460 --> 00:47:57,980
All the wasted time.

1362
00:47:57,980 --> 00:48:00,980
All the Curderburgers.

1363
00:48:00,980 --> 00:48:01,900
Okay, listen.

1364
00:48:01,900 --> 00:48:03,820
If you only had time.

1365
00:48:03,820 --> 00:48:05,080
That's how you go.

1366
00:48:05,080 --> 00:48:05,980
Here's a question.

1367
00:48:05,980 --> 00:48:07,020
Here's another question.

1368
00:48:07,020 --> 00:48:10,140
We're gonna help two people this week.

1369
00:48:10,140 --> 00:48:11,840
I live in a duplex,

1370
00:48:11,840 --> 00:48:14,300
and I've only interacted with my neighbor once

1371
00:48:14,300 --> 00:48:15,500
back when we moved in.

1372
00:48:16,460 --> 00:48:18,120
The other day, I could hear him singing a song

1373
00:48:18,120 --> 00:48:20,700
from Les Miserables through the wall.

1374
00:48:20,700 --> 00:48:21,820
Here's the thing.

1375
00:48:21,820 --> 00:48:24,140
I also love to sing show tunes.

1376
00:48:24,140 --> 00:48:26,480
How do I approach him about our shared interests?

1377
00:48:26,480 --> 00:48:27,480
Without letting him know,

1378
00:48:27,480 --> 00:48:29,380
I could hear his private singing moments.

1379
00:48:29,380 --> 00:48:31,180
That's from Perplexed in a duplex.

1380
00:48:32,060 --> 00:48:33,380
Why not let him know?

1381
00:48:33,380 --> 00:48:35,500
This is very strange to me.

1382
00:48:35,500 --> 00:48:36,460
Why?

1383
00:48:36,460 --> 00:48:37,300
It's very strange.

1384
00:48:37,300 --> 00:48:38,700
Why is that?

1385
00:48:38,700 --> 00:48:43,620
Because this is a new bit that I've invented for the show

1386
00:48:43,620 --> 00:48:46,240
where I say, I don't know, and I let my brothers help me.

1387
00:48:46,240 --> 00:48:49,340
Cause I have one version of this,

1388
00:48:49,340 --> 00:48:52,100
a different version of this exact same problem.

1389
00:48:52,100 --> 00:48:54,980
Yesterday, or no, it's been a few days now.

1390
00:48:54,980 --> 00:48:59,580
I was driving up to my home and I passed a neighbor.

1391
00:48:59,580 --> 00:49:03,380
He's an older gentleman who I've since learned is a widower

1392
00:49:03,380 --> 00:49:05,020
living there on his own.

1393
00:49:05,020 --> 00:49:08,180
And I passed him and his cars

1394
00:49:08,180 --> 00:49:09,660
are always in the driveway, right?

1395
00:49:09,660 --> 00:49:10,500
I passed him.

1396
00:49:10,500 --> 00:49:14,300
I looked in his garage and he had this fucking sick

1397
00:49:14,300 --> 00:49:17,140
woodworking shop, like sick,

1398
00:49:17,140 --> 00:49:20,260
like real, real choice stuff, right?

1399
00:49:21,700 --> 00:49:25,500
And I'm like, oh damn, that guy's deep in the paint

1400
00:49:25,500 --> 00:49:26,500
on woodworking.

1401
00:49:26,500 --> 00:49:27,940
And then I started thinking like,

1402
00:49:27,940 --> 00:49:30,140
it would be cool to have someone who lives

1403
00:49:30,140 --> 00:49:32,940
like a couple of houses away be like-

1404
00:49:32,940 --> 00:49:33,780
Work wood with.

1405
00:49:33,780 --> 00:49:36,500
A fellow woodworker, like if I get some scraps,

1406
00:49:36,500 --> 00:49:37,900
I'll kick him his way.

1407
00:49:37,900 --> 00:49:39,580
He comes in, he's like, Justin,

1408
00:49:39,580 --> 00:49:43,960
I need a number eight, three inch deck screw.

1409
00:49:43,960 --> 00:49:46,860
I can help him out, you know what I mean?

1410
00:49:46,860 --> 00:49:50,900
But I can't for the life of me think of a way.

1411
00:49:50,900 --> 00:49:52,900
I don't know him at all.

1412
00:49:52,900 --> 00:49:56,540
So I can't for the life of me think of a way

1413
00:49:56,540 --> 00:49:59,300
to elegantly be like-

1414
00:49:59,300 --> 00:50:01,540
And I've expressed this concern to my wife.

1415
00:50:01,540 --> 00:50:02,380
She can't think of anything.

1416
00:50:02,380 --> 00:50:03,420
She's the smartest person I know.

1417
00:50:03,420 --> 00:50:04,260
Can't think of anything.

1418
00:50:04,260 --> 00:50:07,260
I don't know how to elegantly knock on the door

1419
00:50:07,260 --> 00:50:11,380
and be like, listen, I looked in your garage.

1420
00:50:11,380 --> 00:50:14,060
And it was bright in there and I looked in there

1421
00:50:14,060 --> 00:50:16,820
and I saw that you love wood and I love wood too.

1422
00:50:16,820 --> 00:50:19,180
And I just want you to know I'm here for you.

1423
00:50:19,180 --> 00:50:21,780
We could be like, not friends in the traditional sense,

1424
00:50:21,780 --> 00:50:22,620
but you know-

1425
00:50:22,620 --> 00:50:23,940
We could share a connection.

1426
00:50:23,940 --> 00:50:25,540
We could be wood buddies.

1427
00:50:25,540 --> 00:50:26,700
So what are you guys saying?

1428
00:50:26,700 --> 00:50:28,220
Your problem is Justin,

1429
00:50:28,220 --> 00:50:29,900
you're hung up on the elegant part.

1430
00:50:29,900 --> 00:50:30,940
There isn't.

1431
00:50:30,940 --> 00:50:32,020
Hold on, I'm getting some water.

1432
00:50:32,020 --> 00:50:32,860
You can just keep talking.

1433
00:50:32,860 --> 00:50:33,700
Can you hear me?

1434
00:50:34,960 --> 00:50:35,800
Wait.

1435
00:50:35,800 --> 00:50:37,140
Why would he ask for your advice?

1436
00:50:37,140 --> 00:50:38,760
He asked me for advice and then he was like,

1437
00:50:38,760 --> 00:50:40,260
I'm fucking leaving.

1438
00:50:40,260 --> 00:50:41,080
Pay you back.

1439
00:50:41,080 --> 00:50:43,860
The problem is, Justin, you're caught up on the elegant.

1440
00:50:43,860 --> 00:50:44,800
There isn't an elegant.

1441
00:50:44,800 --> 00:50:45,640
Well, I don't want it to be weird.

1442
00:50:45,640 --> 00:50:46,940
But here's the thing, man.

1443
00:50:46,940 --> 00:50:47,980
We get asked all the time,

1444
00:50:47,980 --> 00:50:49,700
how do I make friends with an adult?

1445
00:50:49,700 --> 00:50:51,820
And that is because we are worried about that weird moment.

1446
00:50:51,820 --> 00:50:53,140
You know who I'm fucking worried about that?

1447
00:50:53,140 --> 00:50:54,620
Five-year-olds.

1448
00:50:54,620 --> 00:50:55,460
You know?

1449
00:50:55,460 --> 00:50:57,020
You're just gonna have to roll up and say,

1450
00:50:57,020 --> 00:50:59,820
hey, I noticed that you have woodworking stuff.

1451
00:50:59,820 --> 00:51:01,620
I also am interested in woodworking.

1452
00:51:01,620 --> 00:51:02,460
Okay, imagine it.

1453
00:51:02,460 --> 00:51:03,540
Like really start to break it down

1454
00:51:03,540 --> 00:51:05,700
to its base components though.

1455
00:51:05,700 --> 00:51:06,900
Is he in the shop when I do this?

1456
00:51:06,900 --> 00:51:08,100
I don't know.

1457
00:51:08,100 --> 00:51:08,940
But-

1458
00:51:08,940 --> 00:51:09,780
Exactly.

1459
00:51:09,780 --> 00:51:10,620
Yeah, Justin.

1460
00:51:10,620 --> 00:51:11,900
I mean, do I knock on his front door?

1461
00:51:11,900 --> 00:51:13,220
Yes.

1462
00:51:13,220 --> 00:51:14,740
In the middle of dinner, Travis?

1463
00:51:14,740 --> 00:51:16,060
No, why did I dinner with him?

1464
00:51:16,060 --> 00:51:17,620
I didn't say that.

1465
00:51:17,620 --> 00:51:19,220
Travis, why am I interrupting his dinner?

1466
00:51:19,220 --> 00:51:21,660
He was spraying, Travis.

1467
00:51:21,660 --> 00:51:24,140
No, don't interrupt his dinner.

1468
00:51:24,140 --> 00:51:25,740
He got out of the bath.

1469
00:51:25,740 --> 00:51:26,940
Four o'clock, Justin.

1470
00:51:26,940 --> 00:51:30,340
Four p.m. is a save for the husky neighbor boys

1471
00:51:30,340 --> 00:51:32,540
that's always carrying terrible wood scraps

1472
00:51:32,540 --> 00:51:33,980
out through his trash.

1473
00:51:33,980 --> 00:51:36,860
And Justin saw everything, Travis.

1474
00:51:36,860 --> 00:51:39,820
How can their relationship possibly recover from this?

1475
00:51:39,820 --> 00:51:42,260
Well, then he answered the door in the nude.

1476
00:51:42,260 --> 00:51:43,580
Great idea, Travis.

1477
00:51:43,580 --> 00:51:44,900
Pervert.

1478
00:51:44,900 --> 00:51:46,820
Okay, well, I was trying to, okay.

1479
00:51:46,820 --> 00:51:48,500
I was trying to actually help our brother, Justin.

1480
00:51:48,500 --> 00:51:49,340
And then you guys call me-

1481
00:51:49,340 --> 00:51:50,180
No, help him.

1482
00:51:50,180 --> 00:51:51,620
I'm telling you, I'm serious.

1483
00:51:51,620 --> 00:51:53,300
Do I knock on his door?

1484
00:51:53,300 --> 00:51:54,780
Is there someone at the door?

1485
00:51:54,780 --> 00:51:55,700
Yeah, you knock on-

1486
00:51:55,700 --> 00:51:57,700
And then imagine it, whatever you tell-

1487
00:51:57,700 --> 00:51:58,700
I'm gonna move the mic.

1488
00:51:58,700 --> 00:52:03,700
Whatever you tell me, imagine it happening to you, Travis.

1489
00:52:03,780 --> 00:52:05,660
Hey, I heard your podcast.

1490
00:52:05,660 --> 00:52:06,660
I'm a stranger.

1491
00:52:08,100 --> 00:52:09,340
Yeah.

1492
00:52:09,340 --> 00:52:10,180
No.

1493
00:52:10,180 --> 00:52:12,460
There is risk involved, Justin.

1494
00:52:12,460 --> 00:52:13,300
Don't get me wrong.

1495
00:52:13,300 --> 00:52:14,540
There is a risk involved,

1496
00:52:14,540 --> 00:52:17,580
but the reward of having your own wood buddy-

1497
00:52:17,580 --> 00:52:18,420
Yeah.

1498
00:52:18,420 --> 00:52:19,260
Is the reward.

1499
00:52:19,260 --> 00:52:22,300
Like, you think you're just gonna get that for free?

1500
00:52:22,300 --> 00:52:24,460
You're waiting for the universe to give you

1501
00:52:24,460 --> 00:52:27,100
like an excuse to talk to this wood friend?

1502
00:52:27,100 --> 00:52:28,740
Do I, now, let me ask you this.

1503
00:52:28,740 --> 00:52:30,500
Here's some alternate plans.

1504
00:52:30,500 --> 00:52:33,260
If I don't have the bravery for what you said,

1505
00:52:33,260 --> 00:52:37,220
because he's in dinner, do I send a note?

1506
00:52:37,220 --> 00:52:38,060
Is I send a letter?

1507
00:52:38,060 --> 00:52:38,900
No.

1508
00:52:38,900 --> 00:52:40,620
If it's black wood, do you like me?

1509
00:52:40,620 --> 00:52:41,460
Check yes or no.

1510
00:52:41,460 --> 00:52:42,300
No, Justin.

1511
00:52:42,300 --> 00:52:43,140
What's up with that?

1512
00:52:43,140 --> 00:52:43,980
He's not gonna-

1513
00:52:43,980 --> 00:52:44,820
And if so, would I mail it?

1514
00:52:44,820 --> 00:52:45,660
Cause that's weird, right?

1515
00:52:45,660 --> 00:52:49,180
Now, if you carve a plaque that says that,

1516
00:52:49,180 --> 00:52:51,460
and you deliver a hand-carved wooden-

1517
00:52:51,460 --> 00:52:53,860
You're saying that's the introduction,

1518
00:52:53,860 --> 00:52:56,940
just to be like, here is where my skills are at.

1519
00:52:56,940 --> 00:52:57,780
Right, right, right, right, right.

1520
00:52:57,780 --> 00:52:59,740
Oh, I thought you were saying leave it at his doorstep.

1521
00:52:59,740 --> 00:53:01,260
Like, this is from your secret wood-

1522
00:53:01,260 --> 00:53:03,140
Oh no, I did mean that.

1523
00:53:03,140 --> 00:53:04,220
Okay, good.

1524
00:53:04,220 --> 00:53:05,380
But it's a carved wooden plaque.

1525
00:53:05,380 --> 00:53:08,140
So he's gonna see, like, this is weird, but-

1526
00:53:08,140 --> 00:53:08,980
Bring it to the table, right?

1527
00:53:08,980 --> 00:53:10,460
There's something here.

1528
00:53:10,460 --> 00:53:13,460
I see, also, I know that this is Justin,

1529
00:53:13,460 --> 00:53:15,060
cause he's still walking away.

1530
00:53:15,060 --> 00:53:16,460
I could see him, right?

1531
00:53:16,460 --> 00:53:18,220
He rang the doorbell and I answered it,

1532
00:53:18,220 --> 00:53:19,980
and I see him walking away.

1533
00:53:19,980 --> 00:53:22,060
And at a leisurely pace, frankly.

1534
00:53:22,060 --> 00:53:24,060
And he's watching me very closely

1535
00:53:24,060 --> 00:53:27,020
to check my reactions to what he, to-

1536
00:53:27,020 --> 00:53:28,780
Hey, Justin, come on.

1537
00:53:28,780 --> 00:53:31,660
Yeah, yeah, this is good.

1538
00:53:31,660 --> 00:53:33,020
I have some notes.

1539
00:53:33,020 --> 00:53:36,540
I think people who are experienced in a craft or hobby

1540
00:53:36,540 --> 00:53:38,380
are always looking for an opportunity

1541
00:53:38,380 --> 00:53:40,100
to flex that on other people.

1542
00:53:40,100 --> 00:53:40,940
Yes.

1543
00:53:40,940 --> 00:53:44,220
So you need to supplicate yourself to him.

1544
00:53:44,220 --> 00:53:48,260
And maybe, like, you go up with a shitty bird house

1545
00:53:48,260 --> 00:53:50,660
that is glued to the side of your head.

1546
00:53:50,660 --> 00:53:52,940
And you'd be like, um, hi, I'm your neighbor.

1547
00:53:52,940 --> 00:53:56,580
I can help but notice that you have some wood stuff.

1548
00:53:56,580 --> 00:54:01,100
And I am also into it, but I did this.

1549
00:54:01,100 --> 00:54:04,340
And do you have any kind of solvent or something

1550
00:54:04,340 --> 00:54:07,660
that won't be bad for my skin?

1551
00:54:07,660 --> 00:54:09,900
Cause I have really goofed up over here.

1552
00:54:09,900 --> 00:54:13,940
That person will be so excited for the opportunity to-

1553
00:54:13,940 --> 00:54:15,740
Yeah, that's probably true.

1554
00:54:15,740 --> 00:54:16,780
That's probably true.

1555
00:54:18,500 --> 00:54:21,620
But then they're gonna know the next time you make a,

1556
00:54:21,620 --> 00:54:24,420
you know, a nice stool.

1557
00:54:24,420 --> 00:54:27,020
They're gonna be like, you fucking rope-a-doped me.

1558
00:54:27,020 --> 00:54:28,500
And then you say, no, I couldn't have done it

1559
00:54:28,500 --> 00:54:30,340
without your tutelage.

1560
00:54:30,340 --> 00:54:32,740
Yeah, when you- You've inspired me.

1561
00:54:32,740 --> 00:54:34,940
When you pried that bird house off my face.

1562
00:54:34,940 --> 00:54:37,220
That was- It must have released something

1563
00:54:37,220 --> 00:54:39,340
in my brain. Right.

1564
00:54:39,340 --> 00:54:41,180
By which I mean a pneumatic staple

1565
00:54:41,180 --> 00:54:43,020
that I think I accidentally fired.

1566
00:54:43,020 --> 00:54:45,060
It's somewhere in there.

1567
00:54:45,060 --> 00:54:47,540
From what I know about rotary saws,

1568
00:54:47,540 --> 00:54:50,220
is they like to just fly on off the handle

1569
00:54:50,220 --> 00:54:53,260
and just go zip zap and wherever they wanna go.

1570
00:54:53,260 --> 00:54:54,900
So maybe you could embed one of those

1571
00:54:54,900 --> 00:54:57,860
in the side of his house and then knock on his door

1572
00:54:57,860 --> 00:55:00,500
and just be like, hey, this happened.

1573
00:55:00,500 --> 00:55:03,420
And as a fellow woodsman, I'm sure you know

1574
00:55:03,420 --> 00:55:05,500
all about these stinkers.

1575
00:55:05,500 --> 00:55:09,580
What if he, I'm more, I think there's a non-zero chance

1576
00:55:09,580 --> 00:55:12,420
that he would take my tools away.

1577
00:55:12,420 --> 00:55:13,300
Oh. Wait, you're saying

1578
00:55:13,300 --> 00:55:15,540
that if you introduced yourself as a fellow woodworker,

1579
00:55:15,540 --> 00:55:17,140
he'd be like, no, not you.

1580
00:55:17,140 --> 00:55:18,820
No, you're not. You're not grown up enough

1581
00:55:18,820 --> 00:55:20,260
for this. He would confiscate them

1582
00:55:20,260 --> 00:55:23,740
from you, a 40-year-old parent of two.

1583
00:55:23,740 --> 00:55:27,780
He might confiscate my saws, all my beautiful saws.

1584
00:55:27,780 --> 00:55:29,620
And what if, maybe he just takes the screws

1585
00:55:29,620 --> 00:55:31,140
until I've learned my lesson.

1586
00:55:31,140 --> 00:55:34,580
But then, isn't that what we all want, Justin?

1587
00:55:35,460 --> 00:55:38,660
You're looking for a wood father figure.

1588
00:55:38,660 --> 00:55:39,820
Yeah.

1589
00:55:39,820 --> 00:55:43,300
Well, the problem is like, just this past week,

1590
00:55:43,300 --> 00:55:45,500
I made a footstool for my daughter

1591
00:55:45,500 --> 00:55:47,540
and I couldn't get it balanced.

1592
00:55:47,540 --> 00:55:49,740
Like, you know how you build something,

1593
00:55:49,740 --> 00:55:51,780
it's always a crapshoot when you make something

1594
00:55:51,780 --> 00:55:53,900
that's supposed to stand on the ground on multiple legs.

1595
00:55:53,900 --> 00:55:57,140
And I said it was like wobbly, so I cut it down

1596
00:55:57,140 --> 00:55:59,780
and then it was still wobbly, but the wrong way.

1597
00:55:59,780 --> 00:56:02,020
And I kept cutting it until it eventually

1598
00:56:02,020 --> 00:56:05,660
was offering a negligible height differential

1599
00:56:05,660 --> 00:56:06,500
from the ground.

1600
00:56:06,500 --> 00:56:09,260
And then I got so frustrated that I threw it on the ground

1601
00:56:09,260 --> 00:56:11,220
and smashed it with a big hammer.

1602
00:56:11,220 --> 00:56:14,380
And I think that he should,

1603
00:56:14,380 --> 00:56:16,980
I think maybe he should take my tools away.

1604
00:56:16,980 --> 00:56:17,820
Oh, Justin.

1605
00:56:17,820 --> 00:56:19,940
I don't think that, I think someone should be parenting.

1606
00:56:19,940 --> 00:56:21,660
Maybe you need to approach him in that way then

1607
00:56:21,660 --> 00:56:24,740
and be like, well, can I apprentice with you?

1608
00:56:24,740 --> 00:56:26,660
Can I trust you to stop me?

1609
00:56:26,660 --> 00:56:28,340
Because that's what I did, man.

1610
00:56:28,340 --> 00:56:30,060
I found myself a blacksmith teacher,

1611
00:56:30,060 --> 00:56:31,340
I apprenticed with him.

1612
00:56:31,340 --> 00:56:32,620
It makes him really uncomfortable

1613
00:56:32,620 --> 00:56:34,380
when I refer to myself as his apprentice,

1614
00:56:34,380 --> 00:56:35,580
but here we are, you know?

1615
00:56:35,580 --> 00:56:36,620
Makes me uncomfortable

1616
00:56:36,620 --> 00:56:37,740
and I'm not even part of the equation.

1617
00:56:37,740 --> 00:56:40,060
I will often say like, am I a journeyman yet?

1618
00:56:40,060 --> 00:56:42,460
And he's like, what the fuck are you talking about, Travis?

1619
00:56:42,460 --> 00:56:44,620
I'm like, ah, thank you, that's wise.

1620
00:56:44,620 --> 00:56:47,580
Juice, next time you fuck up a project like that,

1621
00:56:47,580 --> 00:56:51,180
hold on to it, or at least hold on to the scraps

1622
00:56:51,180 --> 00:56:54,700
of when you smash it because of your insatiable rage.

1623
00:56:54,700 --> 00:56:57,140
And then look at the 10-day forecast,

1624
00:56:57,140 --> 00:56:59,380
see when the next big rainstorm's coming,

1625
00:56:59,380 --> 00:57:02,780
and then show up at his door soaked to the bone.

1626
00:57:02,780 --> 00:57:03,620
Oh, yay, yay.

1627
00:57:03,620 --> 00:57:05,900
Maybe even if you want to go this route,

1628
00:57:05,900 --> 00:57:09,940
your t-shirt sticking to your body a little bit

1629
00:57:09,940 --> 00:57:10,780
and you show up with the scraps.

1630
00:57:10,780 --> 00:57:13,660
Not in a sexual way, but in a sensual way, for sure.

1631
00:57:13,660 --> 00:57:15,740
Well, or just a, you know, however kind of way

1632
00:57:15,740 --> 00:57:18,940
you want to frame it, but with the scraps in your hands.

1633
00:57:18,940 --> 00:57:22,100
And then you can make yourself cry and just be like,

1634
00:57:22,100 --> 00:57:24,900
I don't, just say like, I don't know.

1635
00:57:24,900 --> 00:57:28,540
And then have him just, shh, shh, shh, shh, come on in.

1636
00:57:28,540 --> 00:57:30,060
And I think he's going to be into it.

1637
00:57:30,060 --> 00:57:32,100
I'm going to give you this one for free, Justin.

1638
00:57:32,100 --> 00:57:34,420
Would you help me with this?

1639
00:57:34,420 --> 00:57:35,260
That's funny.

1640
00:57:35,260 --> 00:57:38,420
And he's going to know that you're a real deal guy

1641
00:57:38,420 --> 00:57:41,300
when you come at him with genuine Goodwood humor like that.

1642
00:57:41,300 --> 00:57:43,380
Now what's going to be confusing is when he responds,

1643
00:57:43,380 --> 00:57:45,100
I think not.

1644
00:57:45,100 --> 00:57:47,340
And you're not going to be sure if that's a no

1645
00:57:47,340 --> 00:57:48,540
or if that's another pun.

1646
00:57:48,540 --> 00:57:50,340
Yeah.

1647
00:57:50,340 --> 00:57:51,740
That's going to be hard to parse.

1648
00:57:51,740 --> 00:57:54,100
I understand that, but that's the test.

1649
00:57:54,100 --> 00:57:55,780
What if I start misinterpreting like,

1650
00:57:55,780 --> 00:57:58,900
I saw you walking towards my house, so I called the cops.

1651
00:57:58,900 --> 00:58:01,340
And they're like, whoa, saw, I get it, funny.

1652
00:58:01,340 --> 00:58:02,220
Good stuff.

1653
00:58:02,220 --> 00:58:03,060
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1654
00:58:03,060 --> 00:58:03,900
Good stuff.

1655
00:58:03,900 --> 00:58:05,740
I heard you hammering on my door screaming,

1656
00:58:05,740 --> 00:58:08,420
please, please let me in.

1657
00:58:08,420 --> 00:58:09,740
I wish you'd cut it out.

1658
00:58:09,740 --> 00:58:10,580
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1659
00:58:10,580 --> 00:58:12,060
Cut, it's funny.

1660
00:58:12,060 --> 00:58:12,900
Like Woods, right?

1661
00:58:12,900 --> 00:58:14,380
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1662
00:58:14,380 --> 00:58:15,780
Yeah, I get it.

1663
00:58:15,780 --> 00:58:17,740
Thank you so much for listening to our podcast.

1664
00:58:17,740 --> 00:58:19,420
If this is your first time,

1665
00:58:19,420 --> 00:58:20,620
we hope you've enjoyed yourself.

1666
00:58:20,620 --> 00:58:23,460
We release a new one of these almost every Monday.

1667
00:58:23,460 --> 00:58:25,900
We used to miss a lot, but we barely ever do that anymore.

1668
00:58:25,900 --> 00:58:28,340
Sometimes it's just a little late because of life.

1669
00:58:28,340 --> 00:58:29,380
Yeah, or a little bad.

1670
00:58:29,380 --> 00:58:30,220
Yeah.

1671
00:58:30,220 --> 00:58:31,060
You never know.

1672
00:58:31,060 --> 00:58:32,220
Come hell or high water though,

1673
00:58:32,220 --> 00:58:33,380
there'll be something here for you.

1674
00:58:33,380 --> 00:58:35,740
Statistically, there are about 300 good episodes

1675
00:58:35,740 --> 00:58:36,980
in here somewhere, so.

1676
00:58:36,980 --> 00:58:37,820
Yeah, sure.

1677
00:58:37,820 --> 00:58:38,660
Yeah, run the numbers.

1678
00:58:38,660 --> 00:58:40,340
Oh, speaking of, if you are a new listener,

1679
00:58:40,340 --> 00:58:44,380
just start on like 150 or 200 and work forward from there.

1680
00:58:44,380 --> 00:58:45,420
Yeah. Yeah.

1681
00:58:45,420 --> 00:58:48,260
Or start at the newest one, but not the last one.

1682
00:58:48,260 --> 00:58:49,100
Skip the last one.

1683
00:58:49,100 --> 00:58:50,140
The last episode was fantastic.

1684
00:58:50,140 --> 00:58:51,940
I won't take this slander.

1685
00:58:51,940 --> 00:58:53,140
Okay, good.

1686
00:58:53,140 --> 00:58:54,340
Yeah, listen to whatever one's-

1687
00:58:54,340 --> 00:58:55,660
And as you're working backwards,

1688
00:58:55,660 --> 00:58:56,700
when you hit a point, you're like,

1689
00:58:56,700 --> 00:58:57,740
well, this seems weird.

1690
00:58:57,740 --> 00:58:58,580
Stop.

1691
00:58:58,580 --> 00:58:59,420
Stop there.

1692
00:58:59,420 --> 00:59:00,260
Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop.

1693
00:59:00,260 --> 00:59:01,100
Oh God.

1694
00:59:01,100 --> 00:59:01,940
Yeah, yeah.

1695
00:59:01,940 --> 00:59:03,220
If the mics get bad, it's-

1696
00:59:03,220 --> 00:59:04,860
The content will follow.

1697
00:59:04,860 --> 00:59:07,900
The thoughts, the thoughts will also be bad.

1698
00:59:09,140 --> 00:59:09,980
And you know what?

1699
00:59:09,980 --> 00:59:11,980
This is also a good time if you are,

1700
00:59:11,980 --> 00:59:13,420
if you've been a listener of My Brother,

1701
00:59:13,420 --> 00:59:14,660
My Brother and Me for a while,

1702
00:59:14,660 --> 00:59:17,420
why not check out other MaxFun shows during this period?

1703
00:59:17,420 --> 00:59:19,940
They're gonna be doing other kind of intro shows like this

1704
00:59:19,940 --> 00:59:21,540
to welcome in a new audience.

1705
00:59:21,540 --> 00:59:23,340
We've got some crossover stuff that we did

1706
00:59:23,340 --> 00:59:26,060
that's gonna be in a new feed.

1707
00:59:26,060 --> 00:59:29,100
We did a crossover with Maximum Film

1708
00:59:29,100 --> 00:59:30,540
where we talked about good and bad advice

1709
00:59:30,540 --> 00:59:31,380
that we learned for the-

1710
00:59:31,380 --> 00:59:32,220
Oh, this is fun.

1711
00:59:32,220 --> 00:59:33,260
Fun as hell.

1712
00:59:33,260 --> 00:59:36,220
Teresa and I did a Schmaners crossover with Titan Fights

1713
00:59:36,220 --> 00:59:38,540
where we talked about the etiquette of pro wrestling

1714
00:59:38,540 --> 00:59:42,660
and some famous rivalries and some locker room etiquette.

1715
00:59:42,660 --> 00:59:44,380
It was an absolute blast.

1716
00:59:44,380 --> 00:59:45,220
So check that out.

1717
00:59:45,220 --> 00:59:49,060

It's going until October 22nd.

1719
00:59:50,940 --> 00:59:53,900
And it's not just shows and stuff on the network.

1720
00:59:53,900 --> 00:59:56,180
There's gonna be volunteer events

1721
00:59:56,180 --> 00:59:59,140
and limited edition posters and games.

1722
00:59:59,140 --> 01:00:04,140
I'm doing a Jackbox game stream on this Thursday

1723
01:00:05,540 --> 01:00:07,620
at 9 p.m. Eastern time with Janet Varney

1724
01:00:07,620 --> 01:00:11,460
and Carrie Poppe and James Arthur.

1725
01:00:11,460 --> 01:00:13,060
And it's gonna be an absolute blast.

1726
01:00:13,060 --> 01:00:15,780
Justin, you and Sydney are doing a stream too, right?

1727
01:00:15,780 --> 01:00:18,700
Yeah, I think it's Friday night after that

1728
01:00:18,700 --> 01:00:22,180
where we're watching F9 finally and live streaming that.

1729
01:00:22,180 --> 01:00:23,020
There you go.

for two weeks after the show.

1740
01:00:42,860 --> 01:00:45,420
We're doing another Hootenanny episode,

1741
01:00:45,420 --> 01:00:49,260
which is our Lasers and Feelings RPG

1742
01:00:49,260 --> 01:00:53,900
where we play a space, like country band,

1743
01:00:53,900 --> 01:00:56,660
traveling the stars, playing country music.

1744
01:00:56,660 --> 01:01:00,660
You can get tickets for that at bit.ly slash TazVirtual.

1745
01:01:00,660 --> 01:01:04,740
Our theme song is My Life is Better With You by Montaigne.

1746
01:01:04,740 --> 01:01:08,500
It's a great track and the music video is very fun.

1747
01:01:08,500 --> 01:01:10,260
It's got us and Montaigne in it.

1748
01:01:10,260 --> 01:01:11,980
Go listen to all of Montaigne's music

1749
01:01:11,980 --> 01:01:14,860
if you've never made that dive.

1750
01:01:14,860 --> 01:01:19,860
She's incredible and her tunes really slap, man.

1751
01:01:19,900 --> 01:01:21,860
Yeah, they really slap.

1752
01:01:21,860 --> 01:01:24,060
We also have new merch over at McElroyMerch.com,

1753
01:01:24,060 --> 01:01:25,420
including our pin of the month,

1754
01:01:25,420 --> 01:01:27,820
which is from TazJustUs,

1755
01:01:27,820 --> 01:01:31,220
Gryphon's character Hellraven, AKA Del Craven.

1756
01:01:31,220 --> 01:01:32,860
Sales of that pin of the month benefit

1757
01:01:32,860 --> 01:01:35,660
the National Latina Institute for Reproductive Justice,

1758
01:01:35,660 --> 01:01:37,860
which builds Latina and Latinx power

1759
01:01:37,860 --> 01:01:39,580
to fight for the fundamental human right

1760
01:01:39,580 --> 01:01:41,940
to reproductive health, dignity, and justice.

1761
01:01:41,940 --> 01:01:42,980
There's other stuff there too.

1762
01:01:42,980 --> 01:01:45,420
Go check it out, McElroyMerch.com.

1763
01:01:45,420 --> 01:01:49,380
And this is where we come to a bit of an awkward moment

1764
01:01:49,380 --> 01:01:50,580
for new listeners. Not for me.

1765
01:01:50,580 --> 01:01:53,100
Because there's no way for you to know

1766
01:01:53,100 --> 01:01:56,100
that we used to use the Yahoo answer service a lot

1767
01:01:56,100 --> 01:01:57,500
as our source of questions,

1768
01:01:57,500 --> 01:01:59,260
but we don't do that as much anymore.

1769
01:01:59,260 --> 01:02:00,500
Because it died.

1770
01:02:00,500 --> 01:02:01,340
Because it died.

1771
01:02:01,340 --> 01:02:03,300
So now we're kind of lost on that front.

1772
01:02:03,300 --> 01:02:06,220
Except for all the ones that I stockpiled.

1773
01:02:06,220 --> 01:02:08,420
Okay, okay, and Gryphon pretend.

1774
01:02:08,420 --> 01:02:10,120
All the ones I stockpiled before we got gone.

1775
01:02:10,120 --> 01:02:13,040
So this one was sent in by Jim.

1776
01:02:13,040 --> 01:02:14,460
From the office?

1777
01:02:14,460 --> 01:02:15,500
Davis.

1778
01:02:15,500 --> 01:02:16,340
Oh.

1779
01:02:16,340 --> 01:02:17,500
Oh, from the Garfields.

1780
01:02:17,500 --> 01:02:18,540
Yes, and.

1781
01:02:18,540 --> 01:02:20,800
From the Garfield office where they make Garfield.

1782
01:02:20,800 --> 01:02:23,920
And it's asked by Rudy.

1783
01:02:27,620 --> 01:02:31,900
Rudy Giuliani, the scary Rudy Giuliani.

1784
01:02:31,900 --> 01:02:32,740
That's just scarier.

1785
01:02:32,740 --> 01:02:34,860
Yeah, I was gonna say.

1786
01:02:34,860 --> 01:02:38,760
It's from BootyGuliani who says.

1787
01:02:38,760 --> 01:02:42,100
Oh no, you're making me like that character now.

1788
01:02:42,100 --> 01:02:43,980
Oh, Booty, don't get me wrong.

1789
01:02:43,980 --> 01:02:46,720
BootyGuliani is fantastic.

1790
01:02:47,740 --> 01:02:49,760
BootyGuliani asks.

1791
01:02:54,380 --> 01:02:55,220
Yeah?

1792
01:02:55,220 --> 01:02:56,140
What?

1793
01:02:56,140 --> 01:02:57,340
Yeah, what?

1794
01:02:57,340 --> 01:02:59,020
Just read it, Gryphon.

1795
01:02:59,020 --> 01:03:01,000
BootyGuliani asks,

1796
01:03:01,980 --> 01:03:04,140
does anyone want to join me in

1797
01:03:04,140 --> 01:03:09,140
in filing a class action lawsuit

1798
01:03:12,900 --> 01:03:15,660
against Dick's Last Resort?

1799
01:03:16,740 --> 01:03:19,060
They made me feel very small.

1800
01:03:19,060 --> 01:03:35,060
That's the one that wasn't guilty, it's the guilty one.

1801
01:03:43,060 --> 01:03:44,300
Oh, God bless.

1802
01:03:44,300 --> 01:03:49,300
Oh no, that, you know what's funny?

1803
01:03:50,580 --> 01:03:52,900
That would be like the fifth most embarrassing thing

1804
01:03:52,900 --> 01:03:54,540
he's done in his life.

1805
01:03:54,540 --> 01:03:57,500
I mean, it wouldn't even top the chart.

1806
01:03:57,500 --> 01:03:59,500
My name is Justin McElroy.

1807
01:03:59,500 --> 01:04:01,300
I'm Gryphon McElroy.

1808
01:04:01,300 --> 01:04:03,220
This has been my brother and me,

1809
01:04:03,220 --> 01:04:18,220
Gryphon McElroy, and I'll see you guys next time.

1810
01:04:33,220 --> 01:04:36,220
It's better with you.

1811
01:05:04,220 --> 01:05:06,220
Ah, okay, says the doctor.

1812
01:05:06,220 --> 01:05:08,220
In which case, try listening
