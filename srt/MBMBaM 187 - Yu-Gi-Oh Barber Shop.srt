1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:30,800
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:52,960
Hello, I'm John Williams, and welcome to the Olympics.

6
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:59,040
Recognize that one? That's the little tune I came up with called the Olympics.

7
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:00,880
That's the John Williams joint.

8
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:04,640
We're coming to you guys, coming to you guys live from Sochi, and oh my,

9
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:09,520
oh the sidewalk outside my hotel has cracks in it.

10
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:14,720
Oh my, it's so cold here in Russia because I didn't know it'd be cold in the winter.

11
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:18,400
I'm so fucking over it.

12
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:23,920
I'm- you get to travel to all these exquisite places.

13
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:27,120
Exquisite, I meant to say exotic, but it's an exquisite place too.

14
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:28,560
I just don't-

15
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:31,280
There is nothing going wrong in Russia right now.

16
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:33,840
You are lucky to be there.

17
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:36,960
This podcast, by the way, is brought to you by the Russian Olympic Committee.

18
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:39,840
Go check it out. It's great. Everyone's welcome.

19
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:41,840
The best Olympics since ever.

20
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:43,200
Since ever, basically.

21
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:44,800
You're welcome, the world.

22
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:46,240
Sincerely, Russia.

23
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:54,720
Russia has a lot of great features that I think journalists are missing

24
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:57,040
when they're complaining about hotel rooms and-

25
00:01:58,400 --> 00:01:59,680
Here's what they're missing out.

26
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:01,600
Lots of affordable real estate.

27
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:03,680
Oh man, you just- you know what?

28
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:08,160
My- our new- I've been working with the Tourism Committee.

29
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:10,720
Our new slogan is room to stretch out.

30
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:11,920
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

31
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:15,840
Room to create your own smaller country inside our country.

32
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:17,760
And no one else will live.

33
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:19,440
No, no one would know for years.

34
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:21,040
That's how Japan got started.

35
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:21,840
I don't know, guys.

36
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:26,560
Obviously, Russia's done some pretty shady shit.

37
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:31,520
Putin, I guess I'm not a huge fan of Putin, all things told.

38
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:35,280
Oh, I get it, Travis.

39
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:36,080
I don't like to-

40
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:37,200
Yeah, god damn it.

41
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:41,120
I'm trying to fucking elevate the level of discourse in this show.

42
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:46,240
Great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great.

43
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:48,720
I just feel like in the opening ceremony,

44
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:50,160
there was like this big elaborate thing

45
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:51,440
where they had these five snowflakes

46
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:53,440
and then they expanded to make the five Olympic rings.

47
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:55,520
Only one of them didn't deploy and everyone was like,

48
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:56,960
nice try, Russia.

49
00:02:56,960 --> 00:03:01,120
Like guys, it's a- it was a- it was one fucking thing.

50
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:03,920
Can you cut them a little bit of slack?

51
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:06,160
Like shit's not great there.

52
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:07,280
Yeah, they don't have like-

53
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Do you know that to make this-

54
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,960
Do you know how many people they've had to exploit?

55
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:16,800
How many of their humans that they've had to grind down

56
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:18,240
into the doorknob metal?

57
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:19,680
Those are people, okay?

58
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:20,480
Those are people.

59
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:24,080
They take fillings from old women and they pop them out

60
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:26,320
and they turn them into gold-plated doorknobs

61
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:27,920
for you sons of bitches.

62
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:31,200
And you're complaining because the water isn't perfectly clear?

63
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:33,600
Oh, sus, I'm sorry.

64
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:35,440
I'm an old Russian grandma.

65
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:37,600
Here, take the rest of my teeth.

66
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:38,720
My gold teeth.

67
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:43,920
They juiced the citizens to fill- to ice the luge.

68
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:48,000
They needed luge lube and so they just-

69
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:50,240
You're saying blood.

70
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:53,520
They reduced their citizens in a hot pan.

71
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:56,240
Nobody that can believe Jamaica-

72
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:57,360
Ah, I hit some gristle.

73
00:03:58,320 --> 00:03:59,040
Pool runnings.

74
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:00,720
Pool runnings two.

75
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:03,360
The bone slide.

76
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:04,080
You know they're back.

77
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:05,760
I know they are.

78
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:08,720
Well, I mean, not the actors who play-

79
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:09,840
Not Dougie Doug.

80
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:13,040
Wait, how can they race again when the sled broke at the end?

81
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:14,880
Well, they didn't die, Travis.

82
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:16,080
They can buy new fucking sleds.

83
00:04:16,080 --> 00:04:16,800
That was the whole thing.

84
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:17,440
They didn't die.

85
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:19,360
They got up and they carried their shit.

86
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:21,840
Oh, I just turned it off as soon as the sled broke and I went-

87
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:22,560
Yeah, I get it.

88
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:22,960
I get it.

89
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:26,000
You saw the one rail start to wobble and you're like,

90
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,040
oh, these guys are dead.

91
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:30,320
Close, exit, stop, eject the DVD.

92
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:32,320
I don't have time for losers.

93
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:34,480
I'm so excited we got Olympic fever.

94
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:37,440
We can't wait for the games to start in earnest.

95
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:39,120
I enjoyed the-

96
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:46,080
I enjoyed last night's opening ceremonies because they featured Tattoo.

97
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:50,960
Tattoo, apparently, and this is-

98
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:52,560
I'm not joking about this.

99
00:04:52,560 --> 00:05:02,480
Tattoo is apparently the only recognizable Russian musical export of the modern era, basically.

100
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:03,440
That cannot possibly be right.

101
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:05,760
Russia has had one hit and it's Tattoo.

102
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:08,320
That can't possibly be right.

103
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:09,760
There's no way that that is true.

104
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:14,320
Quickly name me your other favorite Russian cultural export and wait.

105
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:15,440
Yakov Smirnoff.

106
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:16,720
Yakov Smirnoff doesn't count.

107
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:19,040
Sum 41.

108
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:22,240
Blink 182.

109
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:22,560
Lit.

110
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:24,400
The band Lit.

111
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:26,320
Lit, the band.

112
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:28,240
Who are those dudes-

113
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:30,080
Eve 6.

114
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:33,760
He schools you on that one, Justin.

115
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:41,760
That entire genre was birthed in the motherland.

116
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:42,240
I see.

117
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:44,560
That wall fell.

118
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:45,440
Boom.

119
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:47,440
It was like bubblegum punk.

120
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:48,720
Wallflowers.

121
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:49,760
Goo Goo Dolls.

122
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:51,680
I don't think any of this is accurate.

123
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:53,040
Matchbox 20.

124
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:53,600
Matchbox-

125
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:56,320
Yes.

126
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:57,680
Yes, Matchbox 20.

127
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:58,240
I'll count it.

128
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:01,760
I have a problem when I go out to eat with other people.

129
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:05,120
Once our food comes out, I always eat it too fast.

130
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:10,320
I don't think I'm wolfing down my food, but I'm consistently finished 10 minutes

131
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:13,680
before anyone else in my group.

132
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:15,360
It doesn't seem to bother my girlfriend.

133
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:17,520
We always make jokes when we're out and notice it.

134
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:23,360
However, when I'm out with less intimate friends, particularly professional business contacts,

135
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:26,560
I feel rude finishing well ahead of them.

136
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:26,960
Should I?

137
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:32,880
Am I unwittingly putting my dining partners on a kind of mild blast by eating faster than them?

138
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:37,680
If so, how can I slow my roll at restaurants and match the pace of my group?

139
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:39,680
That's from Fast Finisher and Fairfax.

140
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:42,800
Guys, we've been doing this for a long time.

141
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:50,000
You gotta throw us some harder questions that cannot be answered with eat slower.

142
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:53,200
Like, we're professionals here.

143
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:59,200
You could answer this question with two, maybe two and a half brothers.

144
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:04,320
But let me throw this out because I'm also a fast eater.

145
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:05,920
The problem is-

146
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:09,040
I might suggest the fastest eater.

147
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:13,280
Well, I have been described as looking like I'm afraid someone's gonna take my food bowl away.

148
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:19,360
But the problem is that sometimes you're going and you think you're pacing yourself.

149
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:24,080
You think you're going slow and you look up and like they haven't even started.

150
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:24,400
Yeah.

151
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:25,680
And you're like, God damn it.

152
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:29,280
So what I do is I wait 10 minutes, let everyone else start eating,

153
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:31,200
and then I make a face just so you can catch up.

154
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:35,360
You give them a head start in fairness's sake.

155
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:37,760
All right, I'm gonna spot you fools 10 minutes.

156
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:40,240
You guys go ahead. No, no, no, it's fine.

157
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:41,200
I'll catch up.

158
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:43,280
Yeah, the freight trains are coming.

159
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:44,640
You know, it might be fun.

160
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:46,480
Fun little exercise whenever you're out.

161
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:49,040
And this would be really great for like a business associate

162
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:54,160
would be to mirror them perfectly while you're eating.

163
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:57,680
So every time they take a bite, you take an equally sized bite

164
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:01,440
at literally the exact same time to the same exact amount of choose

165
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:03,760
and just keep your eyes fucking locked on them.

166
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:05,520
Just keep it locked.

167
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:07,440
It'll be like one of those theater exercises.

168
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:09,360
Like when you're mirroring each other.

169
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:12,880
Or what you can do is you get like a big plastic ball

170
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:15,440
and you put it on your plate and you have to push it around

171
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:17,840
to get to the food so you don't eat so fast.

172
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:20,400
That's what you do with dogs who gulp their food down.

173
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:22,080
I think it works for human beings too.

174
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:24,880
In a professional setting, you're at a big business eating it.

175
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:28,400
A plastic ball in your food.

176
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:31,440
Yeah, you gotta push it around to get to it so you can't eat it too fast.

177
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:32,880
It makes it more of a challenge.

178
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:35,520
You know, for some people eating has become too easy

179
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:37,360
and it's just easy to just like fly through it.

180
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:39,280
So you need to just provide some challenge.

181
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:43,360
What if you just dump like a sickening amount of salt on your food

182
00:08:43,920 --> 00:08:46,720
to where every bite is like a painful trial.

183
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:49,120
It's like a Sisyphean task just to choke it down.

184
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:50,720
Would that help?

185
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:52,240
Or order something you hate.

186
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:54,960
Like if you actively know you hate pasta, just like,

187
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:56,240
I'll take the pasta dish.

188
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:57,360
Your girlfriend's like, what?

189
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:58,720
But you don't like, honey, I know.

190
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:03,600
Of all the foods, Travis, who hates pasta?

191
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:04,560
I do.

192
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:08,720
Pasta is such a, it's like saying I hate bread.

193
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:10,080
Like there's all kinds of different bread.

194
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:11,440
I do hate spaghetti.

195
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:14,160
I mean, I don't actively hate spaghetti, but it's not my favorite.

196
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:16,080
Did you barf it up once?

197
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:17,120
I ate it several times.

198
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:18,560
I remember that.

199
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:20,560
I remember that night at the lake house cabin.

200
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:21,760
That was a bad night.

201
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:24,320
It's just such a cheap food in college that you're like,

202
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:26,480
we're gonna eat some spaghetti and then party.

203
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:29,520
And it can go out wrong holes.

204
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:31,840
It actually prefers to go out wrong holes.

205
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:34,640
Give me two of your deer nuts.

206
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:39,200
Shooting spaghetti out your deers.

207
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:41,520
Like one of those Play-Doh hair maker things,

208
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:43,520
and it just pushes out your hair.

209
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:45,760
He partied so hard, he noodle cried.

210
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:47,600
It was brutal, man.

211
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:49,760
Can you just order more food?

212
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:52,160
Get two dinners, that's what I do.

213
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:55,040
Get two dinners, okay, hold on, sorry.

214
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:56,880
Scratch that, strike it from the record,

215
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:59,120
because if it's something Travis does vis-a-vis

216
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:01,840
the consumption of food, then maybe-

217
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:03,920
I can't decide between the steak dish and the chicken dish?

218
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:06,800
Do not worry, my friend, I've got a solution for you.

219
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:08,080
Is yes an option?

220
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:09,920
How about this?

221
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:12,480
Get work-intensive food, like crab claws.

222
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:14,320
How about that?

223
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:15,840
That'll take you a while to get through.

224
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:16,880
Let me throw this out, though.

225
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:18,240
If you're trying to be a professional

226
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:19,680
in a professional setting,

227
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:21,200
and you can't control yourself enough

228
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:22,720
to slow down your eating,

229
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:25,280
maybe something that you have to suck and chew on

230
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:29,440
is not the most attractive poison to get.

231
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:32,800
Well, you don't, I mean, how is your crab cracking game

232
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:35,920
if you're just going at it like a fucking feared wolf?

233
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:40,560
Our dad Clint McElroy, you may know him from the radio,

234
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:44,960
he would, when we were on vacation

235
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:46,800
in any sort of coastal region,

236
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:49,840
he would always look forward to the night

237
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:52,160
where he would eat at an all-you-can-eat crab place.

238
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:54,560
And the all-you-can-eat crab place

239
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:56,240
would not look forward to-

240
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:58,240
He would not add his picture up.

241
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:01,760
And we would literally finish our dinners

242
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:06,640
and then go shopping and come back for that later.

243
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:08,960
Good ketchup for the winter months.

244
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:10,960
But I think the terrible truth about it

245
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:14,320
is that with eating crab claws,

246
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:17,600
you are literally expending as much energy

247
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:23,120
to open them as you're being provided by your body.

248
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:24,320
It's just an endless cycle.

249
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:25,840
There's no getting full

250
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:28,320
because you're just burning it as it comes in.

251
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:30,400
Unless you do it in the Clint McElroy,

252
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:35,120
he was very chimpanzee-esque in his ways.

253
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:38,400
He would stick twigs and sticks in.

254
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:40,320
No, he would just jam a finger

255
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:43,040
into the belly of its tummy chitin'

256
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:45,360
and then just put his mouth on that hole

257
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:48,880
and then just all of the meat from inside the crab

258
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:51,120
would just shoot into his gullet.

259
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:55,520
He has a very particular set of skills.

260
00:11:55,520 --> 00:11:56,800
You guys want Yahoo?

261
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:57,200
Please.

262
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:02,480
I mean, let's just start off with a horse question

263
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:05,600
because it's like what people want.

264
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:07,840
This is our wreck of the Edmund Fitzgerald.

265
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:09,520
It's what people came to hear.

266
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:11,840
This one was sent in by Joseph Hoglid.

267
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:12,560
Thank you, Joseph.

268
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:15,280
It's by Yahoo Answers user Gabby who asks,

269
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:18,800
I need to steal a horse slash horse gear.

270
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:24,080
I'm not looking for answers saying,

271
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:26,320
oh, don't do it, it's the wrong thing to do.

272
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:28,480
I just want ideas on how to do it.

273
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:34,640
Okay, so the paddock, it is in half wire fencing

274
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:37,200
and the stable which has tack in it

275
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:39,360
is right next to the stable.

276
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:40,080
Wow, Jesus.

277
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:44,240
This is, of course, from the rear of their property.

278
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:46,320
Okay, so how do I tell if they're home,

279
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:47,280
like in their house?

280
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:48,800
What should I wear to steal?

281
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:49,840
Thanks.

282
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:52,560
This is easy.

283
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:54,400
Have we done horse thievery before?

284
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:56,000
I think we've talked about how difficult it is

285
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,400
to steal a horse, but we've never devised

286
00:12:58,400 --> 00:13:00,160
a fucking Danny Ocean plan.

287
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:03,840
I question one thing about this question.

288
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:07,120
That is this person is in the market

289
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:10,800
to steal a horse or horse gear.

290
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:12,960
It seems like-

291
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:14,800
I assumed it was an and.

292
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:16,640
Oh, okay.

293
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:17,440
All right.

294
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:19,680
That's not like I either need a horse

295
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:21,520
or just, I don't know, like a saddle

296
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:23,840
I can put on a fence in my own imagination.

297
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:25,680
I mean, as we covered in the last episode,

298
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:27,520
the fucking recurring expenses,

299
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:29,840
the upkeep of a goddamn horse

300
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:31,440
will put you out of house and home.

301
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:35,040
It would be much, much, much less expensive

302
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:36,480
to just have a saddle

303
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:38,240
because you don't have to feed that shit.

304
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:40,080
You just like keep it in your room.

305
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:40,560
Look at it.

306
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:44,000
Sit on it, sit on a desk chair and make believe.

307
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:47,360
I think all you need to steal a horse

308
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:48,880
is a really big trench coat.

309
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:50,080
And you put that on the horse?

310
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:52,480
Well, I mean, I figured you'd-

311
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:54,640
And then you put the trench coat on you.

312
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:56,160
You're a centaur.

313
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:57,840
You're just a centaur, basically.

314
00:13:58,400 --> 00:13:59,040
Oh, hello.

315
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:02,720
Oh, you've caught me touring your grounds.

316
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:04,160
I hope you don't mind.

317
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:06,000
I'm looking for a summer home.

318
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,880
I'm looking for a sweet Philly to call my mate.

319
00:14:10,640 --> 00:14:12,480
Please try to ignore the horse face

320
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:14,240
coming out of my stomach.

321
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:14,800
It's a birth defect.

322
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:16,640
I'm having that removed later.

323
00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:18,160
I'm having it removed.

324
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:19,840
You may be wondering what happens

325
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:22,960
when a full-blown centaur makes love to a Philly.

326
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:24,400
Well, I'll tell you.

327
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:27,200
One quarter human, three quarters horse,

328
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:29,440
and you'll never guess which quarter it gets.

329
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:32,320
One quarter human, three quarters horse,

330
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:34,480
and 100% plesior.

331
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:37,440
The human butt is what a quarter centaur-

332
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:39,360
Just the butt?

333
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:40,720
It's a horse with a human butt.

334
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:43,600
Right, it is a lot of stuff.

335
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:46,800
That's a horse of a horrifyingly different color.

336
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:50,800
Damn, horses love them apple bottom jeans.

337
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:52,480
Stealing a horse slash horse gear.

338
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:53,920
How do we tell if they're home?

339
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:54,640
First you put-

340
00:14:54,640 --> 00:14:56,400
Well, how do you tell if the horse is home?

341
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:57,840
They don't have a busy life.

342
00:14:57,840 --> 00:14:58,720
They're usually there.

343
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:02,240
I guess he's either out jumping or-

344
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:05,040
He's either jumping or looking for oats.

345
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:06,800
He's got bowling on Wednesdays,

346
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:09,440
but other than that, it's pretty wide open.

347
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:12,320
Yeah, he's gonna join a football team with Tony Danza

348
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:13,920
and lead the team to the-

349
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:15,520
But that's not until the spring.

350
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:16,240
Yeah, so you-

351
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:18,960
That's not until like 1998.

352
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:20,080
When did that movie come out?

353
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:23,040
Horse punters.

354
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:24,640
I conflated a few movies there.

355
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:27,440
I conflated Horses with the movie

356
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:29,600
where Tony Danza was a garbage man

357
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:32,480
that kicked field goals for the Philadelphia Eagles.

358
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:35,680
Let me show you how to kick a football, Tony Danza.

359
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:37,600
Tony!

360
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:40,320
God, if that movie had him being trained by a horse.

361
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:42,720
Why is Tony Danza punting the ball

362
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:44,800
with the back of his foot backwards?

363
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:46,480
Why is Tony Danza on television?

364
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:49,280
Why am I watching this movie?

365
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:50,480
Oh, cause I'm super high.

366
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:52,880
Thanks, Tony Danza.

367
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:53,680
That's right.

368
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:54,400
I remember now.

369
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:55,200
Thanks, Tony D.

370
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:59,520
If those dogs from Incredible Journey could get back,

371
00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:01,280
don't you think this horse is gonna escape

372
00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:07,360
at first opportunity and run back to their owners?

373
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:09,280
That bond is unbreakable.

374
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:11,760
You can't drive to a different geographical location.

375
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:14,160
What I'm saying is that if you're gonna steal a horse

376
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:17,440
from somebody, it better be glue day one.

377
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:20,320
You better turn it into glue immediately.

378
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:21,760
Otherwise it's gonna run back to its owner.

379
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:23,840
Well, then why not just steal some glue?

380
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:28,560
It seems significantly easier.

381
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:28,960
It does.

382
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:30,320
Yeah, you think that, but I mean,

383
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:31,840
think about your ROI, Travis.

384
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:33,680
You never think about your ROI.

385
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:36,240
You would have to steal a shit ton of glue.

386
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:36,720
Yeah, I mean, it's a lot of glue.

387
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:38,640
And that glue is gonna be, you gotta think about-

388
00:16:38,640 --> 00:16:40,480
Well, you just need a big trench coat.

389
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:43,600
Hey guys, listen.

390
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:44,960
A friend of mine is having a baby shower

391
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:47,600
to celebrate them adopting a teenager.

392
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:50,320
Obviously the traditional diapers and onesies won't work,

393
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:51,920
so I don't know what to get.

394
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:53,120
What kind of present would you get

395
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:54,800
for a baby shower for a teenage boy?

396
00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:57,440
That's from Gmail.

397
00:16:57,440 --> 00:16:58,560
Yu-Gi-Oh cards.

398
00:16:58,560 --> 00:16:59,200
Next question.

399
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:01,520
Kids love that shit, right?

400
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:04,000
Why are you assuming he's not an adult teen baby?

401
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:04,720
He might be.

402
00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:06,560
Oh, Christ.

403
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:09,040
I had literally just gotten to a point in my life

404
00:17:09,040 --> 00:17:10,720
where I'd forgotten that terminology.

405
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:13,200
Please find out, do me a favor.

406
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:18,320
Maybe the thing with, okay, the thing with baby gifts

407
00:17:18,320 --> 00:17:21,440
is that the reason people like to do baby showers

408
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:25,920
and people have them and can have them,

409
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:27,680
like can literally have them,

410
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:30,960
is that babies aren't people in the traditional sense

411
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:33,120
in that you could just buy them anything

412
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:35,120
that fits their body and you're like,

413
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:37,840
hey, you like this now, baby, handle it.

414
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:39,840
Handle this bib that has a dinosaur on it

415
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:41,120
because now you like dinosaurs.

416
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:42,480
I can make you like anything I want.

417
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:44,480
Back when I was too young to protest,

418
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:47,040
our parents put like sports balls

419
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:49,040
around the border of my room.

420
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:52,640
Like they painted them on there, like sports balls.

421
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:56,240
Maybe this will take purchase in our baby's dumb brain.

422
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:58,320
It is, yeah, no dice, guys.

423
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:00,640
It didn't, it doesn't work that way.

424
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:02,400
Now that he's a 13-year-old boy,

425
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:04,480
maybe you could just get him

426
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:07,360
like the things you would give for a human.

427
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:09,680
Maybe get him like a gift card.

428
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:12,720
Like find out what he likes and then like-

429
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:14,880
Okay, Justin, you're talking big game right now.

430
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:16,400
What do teens like?

431
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:17,760
This is a new fun game show

432
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:19,040
that we play only on my brother and my brother.

433
00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:20,960
Do you know what they like?

434
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:22,400
To be asked.

435
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:24,080
Just ask them, that's what I'm saying.

436
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:25,680
Just ask them like a person.

437
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:26,960
Like what is this kid?

438
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:28,000
Does he like video games?

439
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:28,960
Does he like sports?

440
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:30,160
Does he like to read?

441
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:31,120
I have a good one.

442
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:34,880
Why don't you get him a gift card to like-

443
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:36,320
Auntie Anne's pretzels.

444
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:38,240
Can you just let me finish a sentence?

445
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:39,840
It's just that everyone likes pretzels.

446
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:40,880
Just one sentence.

447
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:41,280
I just want to finish.

448
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:43,040
If they like the pretzel, maybe he's a big pretzel fan.

449
00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:43,680
Justin, I'm sorry.

450
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:44,880
I know you were onto something good there,

451
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:47,840
but I feel like Travis might be onto something better.

452
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:51,680
Teens love pretzels.

453
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:54,800
Teens love wrapped foods.

454
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:56,320
They love them all camaraderie.

455
00:18:57,680 --> 00:18:58,880
It's a weird situation.

456
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:01,280
You want to show this new teen out the gate

457
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:03,360
that you are like fucking Keaton.

458
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:07,600
You are cool Uncle Barry or Aunt Harriet.

459
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:10,800
You want to just like get him a gift

460
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:11,840
and show that you fucking just

461
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:14,160
preternaturally know what teens like.

462
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:15,840
Because hey, I was a teen once.

463
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:16,800
I shot that Hot Topic.

464
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:20,000
We were not teens like these teens were teens.

465
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:22,880
We didn't have cell phones or internet.

466
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:24,640
It has, there's no connection.

467
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:28,080
My Flappy Bird was Jesus Christ.

468
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:30,020
What?

469
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:32,880
You know Flappy Bird?

470
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:35,040
The game Flappy Bird?

471
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:37,120
The energy that teens are putting into that,

472
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:38,800
I put into Jesus Christ.

473
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:41,120
At church camp and stuff.

474
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:44,480
Maybe get my gift certificate to church camp.

475
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:45,760
Or Flappy Bird.

476
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:46,960
This is a real pickle you're in.

477
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:48,240
I'm going to stick with you Geocards

478
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:49,760
and let's just go on to another question.

479
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:52,560
Okay, let me ask you guys.

480
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:55,040
Yu-Gi-Oh cards is an investment.

481
00:19:55,040 --> 00:19:56,160
You know, it's like a fucking,

482
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:57,680
you're buying that kid bonds.

483
00:19:57,680 --> 00:19:59,040
It's like a bond.

484
00:19:59,040 --> 00:20:01,520
You're basically buying him stocks and bonds.

485
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:03,680
This is for your future.

486
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:04,400
Don't look at it.

487
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:07,040
I mean, do look at it.

488
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:08,560
Cause I do need someone to play with.

489
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:09,920
How about a Yahoo?

490
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:11,520
Yeah, Yahoo would be great.

491
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:14,880
This Yahoo was sent in by Kyle Foreman.

492
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:15,360
Thank you, Kyle.

493
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:17,920
It's by Yahoo answers user Bialo who asks,

494
00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:19,760
how to shave mustache.

495
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:20,560
14 year old.

496
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:24,080
I am beginning to notice that my mustache

497
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:25,680
is starting to stand out more

498
00:20:25,680 --> 00:20:27,280
and I want to get rid of it.

499
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:28,960
I have never done this in my life.

500
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:30,480
So shaving would be new to me.

501
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:33,280
I want my mustache completely gone.

502
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:35,040
No mustache hairstyle, please.

503
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:39,040
All right, here's my mustache status.

504
00:20:39,040 --> 00:20:42,080
Color, black, size, relatively small.

505
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:43,280
Health, 100.

506
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:46,480
Defense, 60G.

507
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:49,680
Defense, 62 intelligence.

508
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:51,280
What's your mustache's stamina?

509
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:53,360
Yukio summon points, three.

510
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:56,080
How do you shave?

511
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:57,520
My mustache is low on mana.

512
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:02,000
My brother has all these shaving cream and razor.

513
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,280
I'm going to borrow his.

514
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:05,840
Please list the steps and tips on how to shave.

515
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:08,640
Like should I stroke up or down or side

516
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:11,040
or wet the mustache or shave it dry?

517
00:21:11,040 --> 00:21:11,920
Whoa, buddy.

518
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:13,760
Oh my God.

519
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:16,320
All you need to know is do it with reckless abandon.

520
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:21,200
Oh, guys, I am experiencing like a little bit

521
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:23,760
of almost like paternal pride

522
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:25,680
because this question was asked five years ago.

523
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:26,960
I'm just now realizing.

524
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:31,040
So Biala probably has his mustache shaving game on point.

525
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:33,520
Or maybe he doesn't because nobody answered his question.

526
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:36,880
But no one calls Biala anymore.

527
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:38,320
They call him Scarface Man.

528
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:40,000
Scarface, but scar lip.

529
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,200
Lipless Jim.

530
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:42,000
Lipless Joe.

531
00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:45,440
Additional details.

532
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:47,840
Edit, if I shave my mustache, will it grow thicker?

533
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:48,720
I don't like that.

534
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:49,680
I won't cut it then.

535
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:51,200
Oh, man.

536
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:54,800
You're going to commit to just having a weird wisp of hair

537
00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:56,800
above your lip for your entire life?

538
00:21:56,800 --> 00:21:57,440
Yeah, just one.

539
00:21:57,440 --> 00:21:59,920
Understand if I were to ever shave it,

540
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:04,720
I would only become more powerful if I strike it down.

541
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:07,600
I don't think we've done shaving tips before.

542
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:11,120
And I imagine we have some pretty hot ones.

543
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:12,080
We all have different.

544
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:15,760
See, I use the safety razor and do the wet shaving thing.

545
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:18,480
I'm not sure that that's what I would recommend for a first timer.

546
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:20,400
It seems like a fairly advanced move.

547
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:23,600
Or for somebody who doesn't have like a half hour to kill every day.

548
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:26,800
My trick, honest to God, I just do it in the shower

549
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:29,360
and I do it as fast as I possibly fucking can.

550
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:31,440
Eyes closed, just shaking in the corner.

551
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:32,480
No, no, no.

552
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:37,040
I get out of my ceremonial wazai kishi

553
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:41,760
and I just do a few quick slashes across my face.

554
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:45,440
And chest, because that's important.

555
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:46,000
You know what?

556
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:49,680
Why not now at 14 start rolling up to the barber

557
00:22:49,680 --> 00:22:53,920
and get that like hot lava and just like sit down in the chair

558
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:55,440
and be like, take care of it, Steve.

559
00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:57,200
Go ahead, Ernie.

560
00:22:57,200 --> 00:22:58,160
Do your worst.

561
00:22:58,800 --> 00:23:00,800
Hey, it's my favorite customer, Ricky.

562
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:03,040
Ricky, are you getting your new Yu-Gi-Oh cards?

563
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:06,080
Oh, man.

564
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:09,920
I mean, we're basically describing Rushmore at this point.

565
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:11,120
Basically, yes.

566
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:13,920
Yeah, I remember my first shave.

567
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:15,360
Do you?

568
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:17,920
And it kind of bumps me up that you don't have anybody

569
00:23:17,920 --> 00:23:20,800
in your life that can do this for you, Bialo.

570
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:22,560
You have an older brother, Bialo.

571
00:23:22,560 --> 00:23:24,480
You said he's got all kinds of shit.

572
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:25,440
Yeah.

573
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:26,800
Why are you not get-

574
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:29,280
What is it about your brother's shaving game

575
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:31,280
that has made him an unreliable source

576
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:32,240
at this point in your life?

577
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:34,720
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

578
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:35,280
Not like that.

579
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:38,800
He only does one half of his face at a time

580
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:41,040
and I can imagine that's right.

581
00:23:41,040 --> 00:23:44,320
My brother has shaved a reverse Fu Manchu on his face.

582
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:48,320
He starts at the back of his head and works forward

583
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:52,160
and I don't know much, but he's using acid.

584
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:53,760
Is that right?

585
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:54,320
Is that good?

586
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:56,240
You can always bleach it, so it's just-

587
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:57,200
Bleach it, sure.

588
00:23:57,840 --> 00:23:59,440
Yeah, that's a great look.

589
00:24:00,160 --> 00:24:04,400
Especially if it grows in, you know, full and selic-y

590
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:06,240
and then you have dark black hair,

591
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:08,240
but then like a bleach blonde mustache.

592
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:11,200
That's actually a really great and bold look.

593
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:12,720
I'm just saying that we're living in a time

594
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:14,800
in which mustaches are coming back into vogue

595
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:16,880
and, Bialo, I say you fucking leave.

596
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:20,000
I don't think for 14-year-olds it is in vogue.

597
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:20,640
I think you have to leave.

598
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:23,760
Well, if he starts now, he can be Sam Elliott

599
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:25,360
in like 20 years.

600
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:26,480
You're saying you gotta-

601
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:27,920
Okay, but what start?

602
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:29,360
Like starts what?

603
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:30,400
We also don't know.

604
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:34,960
We don't know what this guy's voice sounds like.

605
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:36,480
So what if in 20 years?

606
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:39,120
Fuck it, what if in three years

607
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:41,360
he has a full-blown Sam Elliott stache

608
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:44,320
but he's like, hey guys, what's up?

609
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:46,480
It's me, Bialo, your buddy.

610
00:24:47,040 --> 00:24:48,800
Yeah, check out my sweet-

611
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:51,040
Legends are made in the Wild West.

612
00:24:51,040 --> 00:24:52,080
They're not born.

613
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:54,480
You can't just become a legend.

614
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:58,320
Let me tell you about Ghost Rider.

615
00:24:58,320 --> 00:25:02,160
Okay, don't start shaving, but do start eating cigars.

616
00:25:02,160 --> 00:25:04,720
If you have that kind of voice mustache combo,

617
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:06,640
you basically legally have to be obsessed

618
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:08,000
with balloons and bubbles.

619
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:10,320
I love them.

620
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:12,320
I love my bounty friends.

621
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:15,440
It upsets people how into balloons I am

622
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:17,920
and also I have this crazy mustache.

623
00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:20,000
Let me walk you through the Roman's Road.

624
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,880
Guys, Jesus' love is just as hip now as it was.

625
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:27,280
The red bead represents his blood.

626
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:30,240
The black balloon represents your sin.

627
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:31,360
We've all got that right.

628
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:34,720
All right, maybe you were a little short

629
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:36,960
with your younger brother when he wanted to play

630
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:39,600
with one of your toys or you looked at a magazine

631
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:40,640
you weren't supposed to.

632
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:42,160
Well, let's pop this black bubble.

633
00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:44,080
That's what the love of Jesus is going to do.

634
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:45,520
Let's all bow our heads in prayer.

635
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:47,600
While I brush my mustache tenderly.

636
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:50,320
See, you kids have a mustache brush.

637
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:53,280
Bialo is the weirdest 17-year-old.

638
00:25:53,280 --> 00:26:07,680
Guys, Valentine's Day is...

639
00:26:09,040 --> 00:26:11,200
I'm talking to guys as in you too.

640
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:15,040
This message is for both men and women.

641
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:18,080
Anybody who has a special Valentine,

642
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:20,720
they want to get something for it.

643
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:21,840
By the time you're listening to this,

644
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:24,400
you only have five days left till Valentine's Day.

645
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:27,600
Sorry, oops, sorry, sorry.

646
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:28,400
You can do it.

647
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:29,120
We did our best.

648
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:30,560
We did our best.

649
00:26:30,560 --> 00:26:31,200
Yeah, oh, sorry.

650
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:33,280
Also, when I said five, I meant four.

651
00:26:33,280 --> 00:26:33,680
What's up?

652
00:26:33,680 --> 00:26:35,120
I forgot we were recording on Saturday.

653
00:26:35,680 --> 00:26:36,960
How's your week?

654
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:38,400
Oh, you're obsessed with this now?

655
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:39,440
Don't worry, we've got you.

656
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:42,640
You're going to go to proflowers.com

657
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:47,520
and you're going to get one dozen long-stemmed...

658
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:50,160
You don't see a lot of short-stem roses, do you?

659
00:26:50,160 --> 00:26:50,640
People don't just-

660
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:51,920
Boutonnieres.

661
00:26:51,920 --> 00:26:52,400
Boutonnieres.

662
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:55,120
Assorted roses with a premium vase

663
00:26:55,120 --> 00:26:57,440
and gourmet chocolates gourmet.

664
00:26:57,440 --> 00:27:02,800
Chocolates for $29.99 or double the roses.

665
00:27:02,800 --> 00:27:05,520
You want to really prove you love this person?

666
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:08,880
Get them two dozen long-stem roses

667
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:12,960
and the premium vase and the chocolates for $10 more.

668
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:14,000
Can you imagine that?

669
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,640
They sent us some flowers to let us check them out.

670
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:18,080
I guess take them for a test drive

671
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:19,440
and they are beautiful.

672
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:21,040
I smell everyone.

673
00:27:21,040 --> 00:27:22,000
I smelled everyone.

674
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:23,120
I tasted them.

675
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:24,800
Strong color, good finish.

676
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:26,640
They weren't made of pipe cleaners.

677
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:28,480
No, they were not fake at all.

678
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:33,440
But like $40 for two dozen long-stem roses

679
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:35,200
that come in a vase and chocolates.

680
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:38,320
You guys have to stop saying vase.

681
00:27:39,040 --> 00:27:41,760
You're killing me inside.

682
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:44,640
Here's the jingle song that I wrote for Proflowers.

683
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:49,840
It's about how shitty my brothers are being to me right now.

684
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:51,520
I'm pretty sure both are correct.

685
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:56,880
And I think in the UK they would say vase.

686
00:27:56,880 --> 00:27:57,920
It's very European.

687
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:02,720
The delivery is really quick and easy.

688
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:06,080
So it's not too late to get them in time for Valentine's Day.

689
00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:07,120
It's very convenient.

690
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:12,640
The flowers are guaranteed the last seven days

691
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:15,200
so they won't be like those fucking flowers that you buy

692
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:18,880
at Sam's Club that are rotten and stinky

693
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:19,920
by the time you get them home.

694
00:28:21,280 --> 00:28:23,360
Yeah, and it's definitely gonna come on Valentine's Day.

695
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:24,160
Guaranteed.

696
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:27,280
So it's great.

697
00:28:27,280 --> 00:28:27,920
You're gonna go to...

698
00:28:27,920 --> 00:28:28,880
Here's what you're gonna do, okay?

699
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:30,000
This is the only way to get the deal.

700
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:32,800
Gonna go to proflowers.com...

701
00:28:32,800 --> 00:28:34,960
Gonna go to proflowers.com

702
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:39,360
and then you're gonna wonder what letters are in that.

703
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:40,240
Don't think about that.

704
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:42,480
Just spell it with your heart.

705
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:44,560
You're gonna go to proflowers.com

706
00:28:44,560 --> 00:28:46,000
and there's like a blue microphone

707
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:47,120
in the upper right hand corner

708
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:49,120
and you're gonna type my brother, all one word.

709
00:28:49,920 --> 00:28:50,800
proflowers.com

710
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:52,720
Click on the microphone.

711
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:54,720
Type in my brother, all one word.

712
00:28:55,520 --> 00:28:56,560
Do it today.

713
00:28:56,560 --> 00:28:59,920
The deal is only around while they have the supplies for it

714
00:28:59,920 --> 00:29:01,200
and Valentine's Day is this Friday.

715
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:03,120
So it's like, don't be an idiot.

716
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:05,760
Just take care of it right now and then you'll be done.

717
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:08,240
And you can use that code and they're gonna...

718
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:10,240
ProFlowers are gonna think we're powerful.

719
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:11,440
They'll keep sending us flowers

720
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:14,480
just because they'll be so proud of us

721
00:29:15,040 --> 00:29:16,640
for doing such a good job.

722
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:18,960
And let me throw this out just real quick.

723
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:21,680
Maybe you're one of those people that sits there and goes,

724
00:29:21,680 --> 00:29:23,120
I don't wanna celebrate Valentine's Day

725
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:25,520
or I don't have a significant other at this point.

726
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:27,600
You know, why don't you send some to your parents

727
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:30,000
or to a friend and just say like, happy Valentine's Day.

728
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:30,480
I love you.

729
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:31,440
I like that.

730
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:32,720
It's not a romantic thing.

731
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:34,800
I'm just taking this opportunity to say you're great

732
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:35,360
and I appreciate you.

733
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:37,440
Just buy the flowers so we look good.

734
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:38,480
Could you do it for us?

735
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:41,600
Really, long story short, just spend the fucking money.

736
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:41,920
Please.

737
00:29:41,920 --> 00:29:43,440
Please, we need this.

738
00:29:44,560 --> 00:29:47,040
Guys, my brother and me is supported by Squarespace,

739
00:29:47,040 --> 00:29:49,600

740
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:53,040
to create your own professional website or online portfolio.

00:29:53,040 --> 00:29:55,600
It's a super easy to use set of tools

742
00:29:56,320 --> 00:29:59,680
that help you make a fucking sexy website

743
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:01,200
for whatever you want.

744
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:01,760
They don't...

745
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:03,600
Here's the thing, they give you the tools

746
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:04,960
but then they're not like,

747
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:10,080
you have to make a fan site of the song Smooth

748
00:30:11,040 --> 00:30:12,720
by Carlos Santana.

749
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:14,240
But you can if you want to.

750
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:15,120
You can if you want to,

751
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:18,480
but they don't like put those restrictions on you.

752
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:20,000
You can freestyle it.

753
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,240
They have a support team that's available for 24-7.

754
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:25,280
They have a brand new logo generator

755
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:27,600
so you can design a logo for your site,

756
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:28,720
maybe a favicon.

757
00:30:30,160 --> 00:30:33,360
And you can start a trial with no credit card

758
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:34,800
and start building the website today.

759
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:37,280
So go to squarespace.com.

00:30:37,280 --> 00:30:39,280
You can use the offer code MYBROTHER,

761
00:30:39,280 --> 00:30:40,480

It's everything you need to create an exceptional website.

765
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:48,720
Did you guys know they fucking...

766
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:50,560
They advertised on the Super Bowl

767
00:30:50,560 --> 00:30:53,280
the same week they advertised on my brother and my brother and me.

768
00:30:53,280 --> 00:30:55,040
It's basically the same thing.

769
00:30:55,040 --> 00:30:58,000
Kind of running the board right now, aren't you, Squarespace?

770
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,240
You're kind of like in charge of shit right now.

771
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:02,160
You have all your key demos covered,

772
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:05,040
sportsos and non-sportsos.

773
00:31:05,040 --> 00:31:07,360
Everyone in the world uses Squarespace now

774
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:08,880
because they got everybody.

775
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:13,760
I got a message for Emily from Artomar Bernard Triscuit and Krang.

776
00:31:13,760 --> 00:31:15,520
Okay, guys, come on.

777
00:31:15,520 --> 00:31:17,120
I think these are animals, Justin.

778
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:18,320
I think these are made up.

779
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:19,520
I think they're...

780
00:31:19,520 --> 00:31:21,040
Omar says, I'm a jerk.

781
00:31:21,040 --> 00:31:22,080
Bark, bark, bark.

782
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:25,280
Bernard says, ghost noises, scamper scamper.

783
00:31:25,280 --> 00:31:27,520
Triscuit says, is it cool if I pee here?

784
00:31:27,520 --> 00:31:29,600
No, cool, I'm going to anyway.

785
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:31,600
Art says, Merry Christmas a month ago.

786
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:33,120
Happy anniversary a few weeks ago,

787
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:36,240
and please remember to buy more chocolate milk.

788
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:40,400
I think 2014 is the year we'll finally be happy.

789
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:41,200
Ooh, Art.

790
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:44,000
A lot of stuff in that.

791
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:45,280
Here's a fun game.

792
00:31:45,280 --> 00:31:48,320
Only one person in that collection is a human,

793
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:50,000
and you'll never guess which one.

794
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:51,360
Spoiler, it's Triscuit.

795
00:31:54,160 --> 00:31:55,600
That's his Christian name.

796
00:31:55,600 --> 00:31:58,320
Yeah, and he has bladder control problems,

797
00:31:58,320 --> 00:31:59,680
and that's not Triscuit's fault, is it?

798
00:31:59,680 --> 00:32:01,440
Is it?

799
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:03,360
He went to Bonnaroo one year,

800
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:04,720
and he got chronic prostatitis,

801
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:06,800
and now he just goes.

802
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:08,480
Now he just goes and goes and goes.

803
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:10,640
So happy everything to Emily,

804
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:12,720
and whichever one of you is a person,

805
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:15,440
thank you for purchasing an ad on our program.

806
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:16,880
Unless a dog purchased it,

807
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:18,880
in which case that would be pretty cool too.

808
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:20,160
That'd be really neat.

809
00:32:20,160 --> 00:32:22,080
Get that dog on Ellen now.

810
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:22,960
Please.

811
00:32:23,520 --> 00:32:24,800
Any other messages, Trav?

812
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:28,400
This one is for Peter Bastion,

813
00:32:28,400 --> 00:32:30,080
and it's from Krista Heiner,

814
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:31,280
and it says,

815
00:32:31,280 --> 00:32:32,480
Dear Pete, it's me,

816
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:33,920
your loving girlfriend, Krista.

817
00:32:33,920 --> 00:32:37,040
No, not the loud, mostly toothless cat that lives here.

818
00:32:37,040 --> 00:32:37,920
That's Tony.

819
00:32:37,920 --> 00:32:39,360
I'm your human roommate.

820
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:40,720
Anyway, happy birthday.

821
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:42,560
I wish you an adventure-filled year.

822
00:32:42,560 --> 00:32:43,920
Love, Krista and Tony.

823
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:46,320
P.S., this shout-out was totally my idea.

824
00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:48,160
Tony just added his name at the last second

825
00:32:48,160 --> 00:32:49,760
because he forgot to get you a gift.

826
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:50,960
Fucking classic Tony.

827
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:51,680
Fucking Tony.

828
00:32:51,680 --> 00:32:52,400
Tony.

829
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:53,760
He's been freeloading off you guys.

830
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:55,440
Listen, you guys need to sit Tony down

831
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,160
and have a very frank talk with him

832
00:32:58,160 --> 00:33:00,240
about his place in your life from now on.

833
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:01,120
But the problem is, Griffin,

834
00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:02,080
like, he's one of those friends

835
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:03,360
that's like shitty, shitty, shitty,

836
00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:05,120
but then, like, when you really meet him,

837
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:07,040
it's like, oh, there he is with a six-pack

838
00:33:07,040 --> 00:33:08,080
because you had a bad day.

839
00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:09,200
It's like, hey, thanks, Tony.

840
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:09,840
That's cool of you.

841
00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:11,440
Oh, wait, that's our Tony, they call him.

842
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:13,040
Oh, that's Tony six-pack.

843
00:33:13,040 --> 00:33:15,360
God damn it, Tony, don't get my hopes up.

844
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:16,640
Bringing in them high-lifes.

845
00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:19,280
Classic fucking Tony.

846
00:33:19,280 --> 00:33:20,640
Classic fucking Tony.

847
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:23,600
What up, dough?

848
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:25,680

what the hell is The Goose Down?

853
00:33:35,280 --> 00:33:37,040
It's a comfort food,

00:33:37,040 --> 00:33:39,600
and we want y'all to climb underneath it with us

855
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:42,640

Our very first guest, Bert,

860
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:53,440
in a delightful portmanteau

861
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:54,880
created by my youngest brother, Griffin,

862
00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:57,840

another podcast for you to enjoy.

868
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:09,520
Welcome to My Brother, My Brother.

869
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:10,240
Meet Cameron Esposito.

870
00:34:10,240 --> 00:34:11,040
Hi, guys.

871
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:13,040
Hi, Cameron.

872
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:15,680
Do you know I have two sisters?

873
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:17,520
Do you know that about me?

874
00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:18,080
I didn't know that.

875
00:34:18,080 --> 00:34:19,200
You bunch of brothers.

876
00:34:20,160 --> 00:34:21,680
Did we sort of steal your game?

877
00:34:21,680 --> 00:34:24,240
Did we like, were you like a day away

878
00:34:24,240 --> 00:34:26,240
from publishing My Sister, My Sister and Me?

879
00:34:26,240 --> 00:34:27,360
And then we're like, hold up.

880
00:34:27,360 --> 00:34:28,720
Let me chomp that real quick.

881
00:34:28,720 --> 00:34:29,760
Right, first I was pissed

882
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:31,360
when Sister, Sister came on the air,

883
00:34:31,360 --> 00:34:32,320
because I was-

884
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:33,120
And then you were pissed

885
00:34:33,120 --> 00:34:34,800
when Sister, Sister went off the air.

886
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:35,280
Yeah.

887
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:36,560
You were like, no, too soon.

888
00:34:36,560 --> 00:34:39,040
And then Sister, Sister, Sister came on the air,

889
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:41,600
and you're like, what are you doing at this point?

890
00:34:41,600 --> 00:34:42,080
Like, what is-

891
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:45,840
Cameron, you should absolutely still do that,

892
00:34:45,840 --> 00:34:49,040
and then we will come and we will take everything.

893
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:52,560
Or joint podcast, like the band,

894
00:34:53,120 --> 00:34:54,240
you know, the band, the band,

895
00:34:54,240 --> 00:34:56,880
and it could be My Brother, My Brother, My Brother,

896
00:34:56,880 --> 00:34:58,720
My Sister, My Sister.

897
00:34:58,720 --> 00:34:59,440
Is that funny?

898
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:01,440
Like, just saying a bunch of words?

899
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:02,720
Let's get all of our parents to marry.

900
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:04,480
Yeah, I mean, that's gotta happen.

901
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:07,360
Number one, my parents are currently married, but-

902
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:10,000
You have a plan in mind

903
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:11,680
if you needed to set it into action.

904
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:15,200
You know the right words to put that seed.

905
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:17,120
Yeah, you just say, I'm gay,

906
00:35:17,120 --> 00:35:18,880
and then bam, divorce.

907
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:19,680
And they're gone.

908
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:21,040
Bye, parents.

909
00:35:21,040 --> 00:35:21,540
Me too.

910
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:25,360
Speaking of being gay, which you are-

911
00:35:25,360 --> 00:35:26,560
I am, I'm a homosexual.

912
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:31,360
You're an expert on gays and their portrayal in the media.

913
00:35:31,360 --> 00:35:33,280
We have lots of questions about that,

914
00:35:34,640 --> 00:35:36,560
and here is one right now.

915
00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:40,160
Sometimes rumors will come up about actresses or musicians

916
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:42,320
that are private about their personal life,

917
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:44,080
and possibly being gay.

918
00:35:44,080 --> 00:35:45,920
In circles I run in, at the very least,

919
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:48,000
the people discussing the matter are very supportive

920
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,240
of whatever floats their particular boat,

921
00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:51,600
but it still seems to me

922
00:35:51,600 --> 00:35:53,920
like they should mind their own business.

923
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:56,160
Does this behavior cross a line,

924
00:35:56,160 --> 00:35:58,640
or should I just untwist my panties?

925
00:35:59,680 --> 00:36:01,440
That's some clever name here.

926
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:03,760
Please don't ever use that word again first.

927
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:05,920
Oh boy, yeah, you wanna talk about offensive.

928
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:11,440
Is it worse if the panties are twisted or untwisted?

929
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:16,000
Justin puts some weird English on that particular ball

930
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,960
that makes it just completely unpalatable.

931
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:22,080
Nika, you in there somewhere.

932
00:36:23,120 --> 00:36:24,320
It's so disgusting.

933
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:28,960
I have actually a pretty strong reaction to this,

934
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:34,000
and it's not necessarily PC, as it were,

935
00:36:35,360 --> 00:36:39,120
but I think that people should be out.

936
00:36:39,120 --> 00:36:40,960
I just think that people should be out,

937
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:42,480
especially if they are,

938
00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:45,360
I don't know what gay rumors really means

939
00:36:45,360 --> 00:36:49,040
in this particular thing, in this particular question.

940
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:52,640
It's the album rumors covered by a gay ABBA cover band.

941
00:36:53,680 --> 00:36:54,520
Wait, ABBA?

942
00:36:54,520 --> 00:36:56,320
No, wait, Fleetwood Mac, everyone start over.

943
00:36:56,320 --> 00:36:58,960
Start the podcast over, start the podcast over.

944
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:02,000
Episode one, hi, welcome to my brother and my brother and me.

945
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,880
We know who ABBA is, we definitely know who Fleetwood Mac is.

946
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:08,320
It seems to me like the question I ask here

947
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:11,840
is saying if somebody said, I heard Zachary Quinto is gay,

948
00:37:11,840 --> 00:37:12,880
and they're like, oh, what?

949
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:15,120
No way, he's never said that before,

950
00:37:15,120 --> 00:37:18,240
and be like, I swear he is, I heard it from such and such.

951
00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:21,840
It's really funny that this person thinks that the actors,

952
00:37:21,840 --> 00:37:23,760
I mean, I wonder if this person is in the industry,

953
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:27,600
only because if not, my love, what a sensitive soul

954
00:37:27,600 --> 00:37:29,760
that they're worried about these actors.

955
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:32,160
What if it gets back to Quinto?

956
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:33,920
What if I'm ever in a picture with him?

957
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:36,000
It's like, hey, I heard you were talking shit.

958
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:37,600
What's your deal?

959
00:37:37,600 --> 00:37:38,880
Hey, is this Danny?

960
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:41,440
Listen, it's John Travolta, Johnny T.

961
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:43,920
Listen, I heard Dan down at My Cross

962
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:46,080
was talking about whether I was gay or not.

963
00:37:46,080 --> 00:37:48,320
I heard some pretty good goofs who did about my masseuse.

964
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:48,880
Guess what?

965
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:50,800
Face Off 2 is canceled.

966
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:51,920
You were gonna be in it.

967
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:53,040
I was gonna take your face.

968
00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:53,760
They will never know.

969
00:37:54,720 --> 00:37:58,320
I think that the reason I think that people

970
00:37:58,320 --> 00:38:00,800
that are involved in same-sex relationships

971
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:04,320
or that are having some sort of same-sex sex

972
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:05,600
need to say that they are,

973
00:38:05,600 --> 00:38:07,920
because this needs to stop being a rumor.

974
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:11,120
I hate that it's something that's still like,

975
00:38:11,120 --> 00:38:12,720
for instance, the word that people use

976
00:38:14,080 --> 00:38:16,560
in magazines and stuff when somebody comes out,

977
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:18,560
so often it'll say like,

978
00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:21,360
such and thus finally admits that they're gay.

979
00:38:21,360 --> 00:38:25,840
Now, the only other things that we admit to doing

980
00:38:25,840 --> 00:38:26,880
are bad things.

981
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:29,200
It's like you admit to stealing from your mother.

982
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:30,400
You admit to that one time

983
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:32,880
where you cut your sister's bangs too short

984
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:34,160
when you were a child

985
00:38:34,160 --> 00:38:36,080
and you told your mom that actually

986
00:38:36,080 --> 00:38:37,760
your sister cut her own bangs too short.

987
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:40,400
No one admits to being valedictorian.

988
00:38:42,240 --> 00:38:45,280
So I think that we just have to change this whole tone.

989
00:38:45,840 --> 00:38:49,200
And if you are at your house talking to your friends

990
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:52,720
about whether or not any particular actor is gay,

991
00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:54,800
I think number one, that's totally okay.

992
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:57,040
I don't know what damage that could possibly do to them.

993
00:38:57,760 --> 00:38:58,560
These are actors.

994
00:38:59,360 --> 00:39:00,080
If that's who you're talking about,

995
00:39:00,080 --> 00:39:03,040
if you're talking about successful musicians and actors,

996
00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:05,600
these are not generally teenagers,

997
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:07,440
although some of them are.

998
00:39:08,160 --> 00:39:09,440
And they're not generally people

999
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:10,640
that still live with their parents

1000
00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:12,240
and rely on their parents for money.

1001
00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:13,680
And they're not generally people

1002
00:39:13,680 --> 00:39:16,720
that are gonna be ostracized by a religious community.

1003
00:39:17,360 --> 00:39:19,040
The reasons not to out people

1004
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:21,280
are if that person needs to be protected

1005
00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:24,160
and Queen Latifah doesn't need to be protected.

1006
00:39:24,720 --> 00:39:26,640
I think it can affect your jobs though.

1007
00:39:26,640 --> 00:39:28,160
That's why people still don't

1008
00:39:28,160 --> 00:39:30,160
because it's like people worry,

1009
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:33,920
well, can everybody take Zachary Quinto seriously

1010
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:38,400
as a Vulcan that feels no emotions if he's a gay person?

1011
00:39:39,600 --> 00:39:43,760
I almost feel like the only way you can pull it off

1012
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:44,800
is if you like,

1013
00:39:45,360 --> 00:39:48,320
the only reason that it would be acceptable

1014
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:51,920
is if you're keeping everything about your private life a secret.

1015
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:54,400
Like you show up to set, you do your acting,

1016
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:56,080
and then you just disappear.

1017
00:39:56,080 --> 00:39:58,400
You're a ghost, so nobody knows anything.

1018
00:39:58,400 --> 00:40:00,480
So then it's not like you're trying to keep our secret,

1019
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:01,680
everything's secret.

1020
00:40:01,680 --> 00:40:03,600
I am so glad that you said that.

1021
00:40:03,600 --> 00:40:05,760
That is so astute.

1022
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:07,920
And I know that was like a little bit of a joke,

1023
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:08,880
but I don't know if you guys remember

1024
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:12,720
when Jodie Foster got out on stage at the Golden Globes

1025
00:40:12,720 --> 00:40:15,200
and like came this close to saying that she was gay,

1026
00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:16,480
but instead it was just like,

1027
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:21,040
as we all know, I wear Winky Birkenstocks or whatever.

1028
00:40:21,040 --> 00:40:25,200
Somewhere in her freestyle jazz odyssey of a speech,

1029
00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:25,920
she sort of touched on it.

1030
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:27,920
If you rearrange all the first letters.

1031
00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:30,480
Yeah, but she named every other,

1032
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:31,600
because she kept saying,

1033
00:40:31,600 --> 00:40:33,440
I like to keep my private life private,

1034
00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:35,120
but then she named, she was like,

1035
00:40:35,120 --> 00:40:37,520
but my mother's middle name is this.

1036
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:40,240
And I had this for breakfast.

1037
00:40:40,240 --> 00:40:43,120
Here's my kids, why don't you show their faces?

1038
00:40:43,120 --> 00:40:46,080
You know, like, I mean, her private life is not private.

1039
00:40:46,080 --> 00:40:48,240
So it is hard when it's the only thing

1040
00:40:48,240 --> 00:40:49,520
somebody wants to keep private.

1041
00:40:49,520 --> 00:40:50,480
I have another question.

1042
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:50,960
Yeah.

1043
00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:52,960
Wait, we can't address my concerns?

1044
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:54,480
Yes, we're addressing your concerns.

1045
00:40:54,480 --> 00:40:55,120
Thank you.

1046
00:40:55,120 --> 00:40:58,160
Is Macklemore's same love offensive?

1047
00:40:58,160 --> 00:40:59,840
Is it the thought that counts?

1048
00:40:59,840 --> 00:41:01,840
What about his Grammy performance?

1049
00:41:01,840 --> 00:41:03,360
How should I feel about this?

1050
00:41:03,360 --> 00:41:07,040
And this is from me, Travis McElroy sitting over here.

1051
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:09,380
What?

1052
00:41:11,360 --> 00:41:11,840
Yes.

1053
00:41:11,840 --> 00:41:13,680
Sometimes we all need advice

1054
00:41:14,320 --> 00:41:17,840
and I don't know how to feel about this whole Macklemore issue.

1055
00:41:17,840 --> 00:41:19,120
I love how you say his name.

1056
00:41:19,120 --> 00:41:20,160
Can you say that again?

1057
00:41:20,160 --> 00:41:20,880
Macklemore?

1058
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:22,480
Yeah, no, that was great.

1059
00:41:23,040 --> 00:41:24,400
Is it supposed to be Macklemore?

1060
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:26,160
I prefer to think of it as like Mack

1061
00:41:26,160 --> 00:41:28,160
and then like the French word for love.

1062
00:41:28,160 --> 00:41:29,760
Oh, that is beautiful.

1063
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:32,240
Same Lemore, you know?

1064
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:35,600
Boys, gentlemen, that song makes me insane.

1065
00:41:35,600 --> 00:41:37,040
You guys just picked all the,

1066
00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:40,400
I sound like a very negative person,

1067
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:44,480
but any song that is saying

1068
00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:48,080
that it is in favor of you having rights

1069
00:41:48,080 --> 00:41:51,040
that starts with like a one minute explanation

1070
00:41:51,040 --> 00:41:54,000
of how when that person thought they might be like you,

1071
00:41:54,000 --> 00:42:02,400
they cried a lot is really tough to get behind.

1072
00:42:03,280 --> 00:42:05,440
Okay, I will agree that in that context

1073
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:06,720
it's pretty cut and dry.

1074
00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:09,920
Think about other civil rights songs.

1075
00:42:09,920 --> 00:42:12,640
Can I read the first line of the song?

1076
00:42:12,640 --> 00:42:14,000
Because I sort of got it.

1077
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:15,920
I probably have only heard this song once

1078
00:42:15,920 --> 00:42:19,120
and I'm more of a rhythm man.

1079
00:42:19,120 --> 00:42:21,280
I listen to the beats instead of the words.

1080
00:42:21,280 --> 00:42:23,040
So this is very striking to me.

1081
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:24,400
When I was in the third grade,

1082
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:25,760
I thought that I was gay

1083
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:27,840
because I could draw, my uncle was,

1084
00:42:27,840 --> 00:42:29,520
and I kept my room straight.

1085
00:42:29,520 --> 00:42:33,840
That's sort of like kind of a crazy like series of evidences

1086
00:42:33,840 --> 00:42:35,840
that you use to come to that conclusion.

1087
00:42:35,840 --> 00:42:38,240
I know you was eight years old

1088
00:42:38,240 --> 00:42:40,720
and maybe that was like enough for you back then,

1089
00:42:40,720 --> 00:42:42,240
but that's kind of crazy.

1090
00:42:42,240 --> 00:42:44,160
In third grade, I thought that I was gay

1091
00:42:44,160 --> 00:42:45,200
because I liked apples

1092
00:42:45,200 --> 00:42:48,160
and I saved about $1.50 for my allowance.

1093
00:42:48,160 --> 00:42:49,120
And I did my chores.

1094
00:42:49,120 --> 00:42:53,280
And people that are defending this song,

1095
00:42:53,280 --> 00:42:54,320
that's what they say too.

1096
00:42:54,320 --> 00:42:54,960
They're like,

1097
00:42:54,960 --> 00:42:57,120
oh, he's talking about how absurd it is

1098
00:42:57,120 --> 00:42:58,240
to think that you're gay.

1099
00:42:58,240 --> 00:43:00,160
But then the next line is like,

1100
00:43:00,160 --> 00:43:01,920
so right after I thought I was gay

1101
00:43:01,920 --> 00:43:03,360
for all of these reasons,

1102
00:43:03,360 --> 00:43:06,720
like you wouldn't believe how dehydrated I was

1103
00:43:06,720 --> 00:43:10,160
from the amount of laying on the floor

1104
00:43:10,160 --> 00:43:11,600
and crying I did.

1105
00:43:11,600 --> 00:43:13,920
Like I was so sad.

1106
00:43:13,920 --> 00:43:14,720
And it's tough.

1107
00:43:14,720 --> 00:43:21,760
I mean, if any of the great anti-war songs

1108
00:43:21,760 --> 00:43:23,040
from the 1970s,

1109
00:43:23,040 --> 00:43:24,400
those songs are about like,

1110
00:43:25,040 --> 00:43:26,880
let's keep the peace here.

1111
00:43:26,880 --> 00:43:30,800
It's not like I thought maybe I was gonna get drafted

1112
00:43:31,360 --> 00:43:36,160
and I was really sad about that.

1113
00:43:36,160 --> 00:43:38,000
But these other guys got killed.

1114
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:39,360
Anyway, let's take care of them.

1115
00:43:40,480 --> 00:43:42,880
It's a really messed up way to start a song.

1116
00:43:42,880 --> 00:43:44,800
I thought I had a hammer.

1117
00:43:48,720 --> 00:43:49,760
Also, he references,

1118
00:43:49,760 --> 00:43:51,120
there's a line that says,

1119
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:54,160
have you read the YouTube comments lately?

1120
00:43:54,160 --> 00:43:56,240
Which I think should be a staple

1121
00:43:56,240 --> 00:43:59,840
of all important social movement based songs.

1122
00:44:00,560 --> 00:44:03,280
And when he did this performance at the Grammys,

1123
00:44:03,280 --> 00:44:06,240
CBS did not bleep the F word,

1124
00:44:06,240 --> 00:44:08,240
which I'm not even gonna say in your podcast

1125
00:44:08,240 --> 00:44:09,600
because I don't say that word.

1126
00:44:09,600 --> 00:44:13,280
But it is a word that is slung at homosexuals.

1127
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:16,080
And he said it on CBS.

1128
00:44:16,080 --> 00:44:16,720
No big deal.

1129
00:44:16,720 --> 00:44:18,480
They probably say it on like two broke girls

1130
00:44:18,480 --> 00:44:19,760
every episode though, so.

1131
00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:23,200
But if you think of the equivalent to that,

1132
00:44:23,920 --> 00:44:25,840
I mean, nobody's allowed to say the N word

1133
00:44:25,840 --> 00:44:27,440
in the middle of a Grammy performance

1134
00:44:27,440 --> 00:44:29,120
where people are getting married around them.

1135
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:30,320
Right.

1136
00:44:30,320 --> 00:44:32,720
Well, that's a pretty specific set of circumstances.

1137
00:44:35,920 --> 00:44:38,800
You know what it made me really sad also

1138
00:44:38,800 --> 00:44:40,720
is that the refrain of this song

1139
00:44:40,720 --> 00:44:42,160
is also sung by a lesbian.

1140
00:44:42,800 --> 00:44:45,120
And it's taken from a song that she,

1141
00:44:45,840 --> 00:44:46,880
Mary Lambert's,

1142
00:44:46,880 --> 00:44:48,320
like the song that this is taken from

1143
00:44:48,320 --> 00:44:49,920
is really beautiful and kind of balanced.

1144
00:44:49,920 --> 00:44:51,040
It's a love song.

1145
00:44:51,040 --> 00:44:54,000
And in the way that it's dropped into here,

1146
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:56,240
it's like the lyrics are,

1147
00:44:56,240 --> 00:44:58,320
I can't change even if I wanted to,

1148
00:44:58,880 --> 00:45:00,320
even if I tried.

1149
00:45:00,960 --> 00:45:01,680
And I think that,

1150
00:45:01,680 --> 00:45:04,080
especially after like somebody saying like,

1151
00:45:04,080 --> 00:45:06,000
hey, I thought I was gay.

1152
00:45:06,560 --> 00:45:07,920
I cried.

1153
00:45:07,920 --> 00:45:10,160
And then like cue the lesbian being like,

1154
00:45:10,160 --> 00:45:11,200
trust me,

1155
00:45:11,200 --> 00:45:12,800
if I could not be gay,

1156
00:45:13,440 --> 00:45:14,320
I would.

1157
00:45:15,440 --> 00:45:16,160
Now see, okay,

1158
00:45:16,160 --> 00:45:18,720
so because this actually ties into

1159
00:45:18,720 --> 00:45:20,080
our last question here.

1160
00:45:20,080 --> 00:45:23,200
Macklemore, I think you can obviously,

1161
00:45:25,120 --> 00:45:26,400
surprising from someone

1162
00:45:26,400 --> 00:45:28,240
that wears such large fur coats,

1163
00:45:28,240 --> 00:45:30,560
he was lacking in the tack department.

1164
00:45:30,560 --> 00:45:34,000
But I think his intention was probably,

1165
00:45:34,640 --> 00:45:36,000
came from a good place.

1166
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:38,000
Our next question asker says,

1167
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:39,520
how do we combat homophobia

1168
00:45:39,520 --> 00:45:42,400
in online video gaming communities?

1169
00:45:42,400 --> 00:45:45,520
And I would extend that to all online communities,

1170
00:45:45,520 --> 00:45:46,000
honestly,

1171
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:49,840
cause internet and encourage LGBT representation

1172
00:45:49,840 --> 00:45:52,800
in video games.

1173
00:45:52,800 --> 00:45:56,000
And I think Macklemore's song was probably

1174
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:57,440
trying to address this issue.

1175
00:45:57,440 --> 00:45:59,280
I can't believe he didn't fix it with a pop song,

1176
00:46:00,320 --> 00:46:04,720
but how can we make things better?

1177
00:46:04,720 --> 00:46:06,000
How can we make things better?

1178
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:06,880
I mean, number one,

1179
00:46:06,880 --> 00:46:08,240
I don't play video games.

1180
00:46:08,240 --> 00:46:10,560
So are there gay characters?

1181
00:46:10,560 --> 00:46:11,040
Sure.

1182
00:46:11,040 --> 00:46:11,440
Yeah.

1183
00:46:11,440 --> 00:46:12,160
I mean, not in like,

1184
00:46:12,880 --> 00:46:14,480
not in like Call of Duty,

1185
00:46:14,480 --> 00:46:15,360
I don't think.

1186
00:46:15,360 --> 00:46:16,240
Like not in like the big.

1187
00:46:16,240 --> 00:46:16,720
Well, I mean,

1188
00:46:16,720 --> 00:46:18,080
those are all gay characters.

1189
00:46:18,080 --> 00:46:18,560
I don't know.

1190
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:22,160
It's funny when a gay person calls somebody gay

1191
00:46:22,160 --> 00:46:22,880
as an insult,

1192
00:46:22,880 --> 00:46:23,200
isn't it?

1193
00:46:25,120 --> 00:46:27,040
It seems to me like the only ones I can think of,

1194
00:46:27,040 --> 00:46:28,400
it's usually like a joke.

1195
00:46:28,400 --> 00:46:29,280
It's usually like,

1196
00:46:29,280 --> 00:46:30,640
hey, here's a flamboyant.

1197
00:46:30,640 --> 00:46:31,120
No.

1198
00:46:31,120 --> 00:46:32,160
Wasn't there a character like that

1199
00:46:32,160 --> 00:46:34,480
in Grand Theft Auto IV?

1200
00:46:34,480 --> 00:46:36,080
Oh, I'm sure there were all kinds,

1201
00:46:36,080 --> 00:46:37,600
but like I don't want to paint

1202
00:46:37,600 --> 00:46:38,320
with a pretty broad brush.

1203
00:46:38,320 --> 00:46:39,360
Like there absolutely are.

1204
00:46:39,360 --> 00:46:40,640
And it definitely is getting better

1205
00:46:40,640 --> 00:46:43,280
as like more and more people make these games

1206
00:46:43,280 --> 00:46:46,320
and like it becomes a more inclusive medium in general.

1207
00:46:47,200 --> 00:46:49,040
Is this person talking about though,

1208
00:46:49,040 --> 00:46:51,680
like slurs that might be slung

1209
00:46:51,680 --> 00:46:53,680
in online video gaming communities?

1210
00:46:53,680 --> 00:46:54,800
Well, video game communities

1211
00:46:54,800 --> 00:46:56,160
and video game fictional characters

1212
00:46:56,160 --> 00:46:57,840
are two completely different ideas

1213
00:46:57,840 --> 00:46:58,960
because like, I don't know,

1214
00:46:59,520 --> 00:47:01,360
indie developers are making some pretty cool games

1215
00:47:01,360 --> 00:47:02,800
that are sort of tackling these issues

1216
00:47:02,800 --> 00:47:05,760
in a really responsible and even-handed way.

1217
00:47:05,760 --> 00:47:07,520
Let's limit the question maybe

1218
00:47:07,520 --> 00:47:09,040
to just online communities.

1219
00:47:09,040 --> 00:47:09,600
That's better.

1220
00:47:09,600 --> 00:47:10,000
Would that be?

1221
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:10,560
I like that.

1222
00:47:10,560 --> 00:47:11,280
Is that good?

1223
00:47:11,280 --> 00:47:12,000
Yeah.

1224
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:13,360
Yeah, homophobia in general.

1225
00:47:13,360 --> 00:47:14,560
Like, I don't know.

1226
00:47:14,560 --> 00:47:15,760
It's really weird for me

1227
00:47:15,760 --> 00:47:17,760
when someone comes from that perspective

1228
00:47:17,760 --> 00:47:21,360
because like I almost feel like you need like hours of time

1229
00:47:21,360 --> 00:47:24,320
to like change their whole sort of like worldview

1230
00:47:24,320 --> 00:47:26,960
if they don't see the immediate problem.

1231
00:47:26,960 --> 00:47:29,280
But do you know what's crazy about it to me?

1232
00:47:29,280 --> 00:47:32,960
Is that it almost seems like it's a poor translation

1233
00:47:32,960 --> 00:47:34,800
in that the words that they're saying,

1234
00:47:34,800 --> 00:47:36,000
they don't mean them in that way.

1235
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:38,960
They mean them in like the most base derogatory,

1236
00:47:38,960 --> 00:47:41,440
just as a set of derogatory words.

1237
00:47:42,080 --> 00:47:43,520
Yeah, no, they're not using it.

1238
00:47:43,520 --> 00:47:46,720
They're not using it in like a descriptive nature.

1239
00:47:46,720 --> 00:47:48,640
Like, they're not like saying it like,

1240
00:47:49,280 --> 00:47:50,480
this is what I think you are.

1241
00:47:50,480 --> 00:47:53,760
It's like an expletive for those people.

1242
00:47:53,760 --> 00:47:55,120
So that's why I'm wondering if,

1243
00:47:55,120 --> 00:47:56,480
rather than try to fix them,

1244
00:47:56,480 --> 00:47:58,800
we just set up a different language

1245
00:47:59,920 --> 00:48:01,920
of like a whole new set of words

1246
00:48:01,920 --> 00:48:03,040
that doesn't offend anyone.

1247
00:48:03,040 --> 00:48:05,280
You're talking about like the Battlestar Galactica

1248
00:48:05,280 --> 00:48:06,720
sort of crap?

1249
00:48:06,720 --> 00:48:08,560
Yes, exactly.

1250
00:48:10,560 --> 00:48:11,920
To understand your point, Travis,

1251
00:48:11,920 --> 00:48:14,640
you definitely still want the malice

1252
00:48:14,640 --> 00:48:16,320
behind these words to be there.

1253
00:48:19,200 --> 00:48:21,760
Okay, Cameron Esposito, solve homophobia.

1254
00:48:21,760 --> 00:48:25,360
Well, the one thing that I,

1255
00:48:25,360 --> 00:48:26,800
this does relate to Rep to Macklemore.

1256
00:48:26,800 --> 00:48:27,840
I'm gonna tie it all in.

1257
00:48:27,840 --> 00:48:30,320
Put a nice Macklemore bow on it.

1258
00:48:30,320 --> 00:48:33,040
I, for one, am pretty,

1259
00:48:33,920 --> 00:48:36,320
and it also, it actually goes back to that first question

1260
00:48:36,320 --> 00:48:37,840
that we talked about too.

1261
00:48:37,840 --> 00:48:43,840
I'm pretty done with hearing straight men specifically,

1262
00:48:43,840 --> 00:48:45,520
because it often comes from straight men.

1263
00:48:45,520 --> 00:48:47,440
I think straight men are the scaredest

1264
00:48:47,440 --> 00:48:49,040
of the idea that they might be gay.

1265
00:48:49,040 --> 00:48:51,840
And I think that comes from fear of butt sex.

1266
00:48:51,840 --> 00:48:53,360
I have a whole treatise about it.

1267
00:48:53,360 --> 00:48:54,560
You can read it nowhere.

1268
00:48:56,160 --> 00:48:58,240
But I think that straight men are the scaredest

1269
00:48:58,240 --> 00:49:00,080
of people thinking that they're gonna be gay.

1270
00:49:00,080 --> 00:49:02,800
And I feel like that is something that,

1271
00:49:02,800 --> 00:49:04,880
if there are any men that listen to this podcast,

1272
00:49:04,880 --> 00:49:06,720
which I'm sure there's two to three.

1273
00:49:06,720 --> 00:49:07,840
There's one or two.

1274
00:49:07,840 --> 00:49:11,600
Yeah, that you could just work on letting go

1275
00:49:11,600 --> 00:49:13,440
of that fear within yourself.

1276
00:49:13,440 --> 00:49:16,160
That's really how we're gonna solve homophobia,

1277
00:49:16,160 --> 00:49:18,240
because I think that's what it's all about.

1278
00:49:18,240 --> 00:49:22,320
Yeah, because religion doesn't really cover it.

1279
00:49:22,320 --> 00:49:24,320
You know, I don't wanna get married in a church.

1280
00:49:24,320 --> 00:49:26,560
And it's not like tradition that's really the problem,

1281
00:49:26,560 --> 00:49:28,080
because many people are divorced.

1282
00:49:28,080 --> 00:49:31,520
It's really this fear that I think a lot of guys still carry

1283
00:49:31,520 --> 00:49:33,680
that somebody is gonna come up to them

1284
00:49:33,680 --> 00:49:35,360
while they're in middle school as an adult

1285
00:49:35,360 --> 00:49:37,680
and call them gay and push them into a locker.

1286
00:49:37,680 --> 00:49:41,440
And I feel like you just gotta make peace with that.

1287
00:49:41,440 --> 00:49:45,520
I mean, Macklemore taking his time to say that like,

1288
00:49:45,520 --> 00:49:47,680
hey, he understands what it is to be gay

1289
00:49:47,680 --> 00:49:50,000
because he used to think he was gay

1290
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:52,240
is not the same as just saying,

1291
00:49:52,240 --> 00:49:53,760
I actually totally don't know

1292
00:49:53,760 --> 00:49:57,600
what you guys are going through because I am not gay,

1293
00:49:57,600 --> 00:49:58,880
but I'm just an advocate for you.

1294
00:49:58,880 --> 00:50:00,160
Look, look, I get it, okay?

1295
00:50:00,160 --> 00:50:01,760
I cleaned my room when I was eight.

1296
00:50:01,760 --> 00:50:04,320
Look, I get it, okay?

1297
00:50:04,320 --> 00:50:06,640
Listen, my uncle, I totally get it.

1298
00:50:06,640 --> 00:50:08,000
I have one more question, Cameron,

1299
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:09,280
before I will let you go.

1300
00:50:09,280 --> 00:50:12,000
And this is one from just from me.

1301
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:14,880
We had Dan Savage on our show a long time ago,

1302
00:50:14,880 --> 00:50:17,360
and he said queer a lot.

1303
00:50:17,360 --> 00:50:21,760
And I just wanted to ask you if that was okay to say now

1304
00:50:21,760 --> 00:50:23,920
or what is the status update on that?

1305
00:50:24,560 --> 00:50:27,920
I'm gonna status update you on queer so hardcore right now.

1306
00:50:28,560 --> 00:50:30,720
Queer, completely fine to say

1307
00:50:30,720 --> 00:50:32,960
if you are saying it in a positive way.

1308
00:50:32,960 --> 00:50:34,000
You can't call someone queer.

1309
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:35,040
I would, I only would.

1310
00:50:35,040 --> 00:50:38,240
But you can't be like, you're queer.

1311
00:50:38,240 --> 00:50:40,240
But you can be like, you're queer.

1312
00:50:41,280 --> 00:50:42,320
Did you get that?

1313
00:50:42,320 --> 00:50:42,820
Yes.

1314
00:50:43,440 --> 00:50:45,760
Can you give me those intonations just one more time?

1315
00:50:45,760 --> 00:50:46,640
Just one more time.

1316
00:50:46,640 --> 00:50:47,440
What if I use it in the-

1317
00:50:47,440 --> 00:50:49,760
He's like, you're queer versus like, you're queer.

1318
00:50:49,760 --> 00:50:51,920
What about in the interrogative sense?

1319
00:50:51,920 --> 00:50:52,720
Like, you're queer?

1320
00:50:52,720 --> 00:50:54,880
Yeah, no, you could definitely do that.

1321
00:50:54,880 --> 00:50:55,760
That actually is great,

1322
00:50:55,760 --> 00:50:56,880
because it's kind of open-ended

1323
00:50:56,880 --> 00:50:58,080
and there's like a sweetness to it.

1324
00:50:59,040 --> 00:51:00,720
What about like a cockney flair?

1325
00:51:00,720 --> 00:51:03,120
So like, hey, governor, you're queer.

1326
00:51:04,800 --> 00:51:07,360
But you got, but he fell off the roof at the end of it.

1327
00:51:08,240 --> 00:51:09,200
Cameron, this is important.

1328
00:51:09,200 --> 00:51:09,920
Can we use it?

1329
00:51:09,920 --> 00:51:11,040
Can we just have fun with it

1330
00:51:11,040 --> 00:51:14,560
like we've been doing for the past 60 seconds?

1331
00:51:14,560 --> 00:51:18,640
Can I do it in a baby voice?

1332
00:51:18,640 --> 00:51:21,520
You can use queer anytime you would use LGBT.

1333
00:51:22,320 --> 00:51:22,800
Okay.

1334
00:51:22,800 --> 00:51:26,080
Because GLBT or LGBT or whatever it is,

1335
00:51:26,080 --> 00:51:28,240
is kind of like a 90s term.

1336
00:51:28,240 --> 00:51:29,200
Like, whenever I hear that,

1337
00:51:29,200 --> 00:51:32,480
I always think of like really wide leg jeans

1338
00:51:32,480 --> 00:51:37,040
and like a backwards newsboy cap, you know?

1339
00:51:37,040 --> 00:51:37,280
Like-

1340
00:51:37,280 --> 00:51:39,600
You think of JNCO is what you're telling me.

1341
00:51:40,320 --> 00:51:40,820
Yes.

1342
00:51:40,820 --> 00:51:45,460
Yes, queer is like a much more asymmetrical haircuts,

1343
00:51:45,460 --> 00:51:49,620
like mustaches on men and women and granola.

1344
00:51:49,620 --> 00:51:50,900
It's like a little bit more of an updated term.

1345
00:51:50,900 --> 00:51:52,980
It's a pair of boot cut jeans from Express.

1346
00:51:53,700 --> 00:51:55,780
Yes, exactly.

1347
00:51:56,740 --> 00:51:58,980
Cameron Esposito, thank you so much for joining us.

1348
00:51:58,980 --> 00:52:01,380
We sure appreciate you taking the time.

1349
00:52:02,500 --> 00:52:04,580
Again, you're on Wham Bam Pow.

1350
00:52:05,140 --> 00:52:07,460
You are on Put Your Hands Together.

1351
00:52:08,260 --> 00:52:09,460
What else do you do, Cameron?

1352
00:52:09,460 --> 00:52:09,860
Twitter?

1353
00:52:09,860 --> 00:52:10,740
Do you tweet, tweet?

1354
00:52:10,740 --> 00:52:12,740
Yeah, at Cameron Esposito.

1355
00:52:12,740 --> 00:52:15,620
And I guess my final question for you guys would be just like,

1356
00:52:15,620 --> 00:52:16,900
do you think we solved it?

1357
00:52:16,900 --> 00:52:19,220
You know, Macklemore set it up and we spiked it.

1358
00:52:19,220 --> 00:52:20,820
Cameron Esposito, thank you so much.

1359
00:52:20,820 --> 00:52:21,860
Have a great day, guys.

1360
00:52:21,860 --> 00:52:22,360
You too.

1361
00:52:22,980 --> 00:52:23,940
You guys want a Yahoo?

1362
00:52:23,940 --> 00:52:24,580
Yeah, please.

1363
00:52:24,580 --> 00:52:24,980
Yes.

1364
00:52:24,980 --> 00:52:26,340
This Yahoo was sent in by Julie Martin.

1365
00:52:26,340 --> 00:52:26,820
Thanks, Julie.

1366
00:52:26,820 --> 00:52:29,220
It's by Yahoo Answers user Amber Kay who asks,

1367
00:52:29,940 --> 00:52:32,500
how would you describe a food court to someone

1368
00:52:32,500 --> 00:52:34,180
who has never been to one?

1369
00:52:34,180 --> 00:52:35,620
Oh God, good question.

1370
00:52:35,620 --> 00:52:38,100
I have to describe a food court in French for homework

1371
00:52:38,100 --> 00:52:40,660
in four to six sentences since apparently food quarks

1372
00:52:40,660 --> 00:52:41,780
are an American thing.

1373
00:52:41,780 --> 00:52:42,980
Uh, you fucking thing.

1374
00:52:42,980 --> 00:52:44,820
Yeah, no kidding.

1375
00:52:44,820 --> 00:52:47,220
I want to get some chicken nugs and some sparrows

1376
00:52:47,220 --> 00:52:47,940
in the same bite.

1377
00:52:48,500 --> 00:52:50,740
How would you describe a food court to someone

1378
00:52:50,740 --> 00:52:52,100
who doesn't know what one is?

1379
00:52:52,100 --> 00:52:53,540
It doesn't have to be in French.

1380
00:52:53,540 --> 00:52:54,660
I will do that.

1381
00:52:54,660 --> 00:52:58,100
All I have so far is a place where several restaurants are

1382
00:52:58,100 --> 00:53:00,420
that people go to eat after shopping.

1383
00:53:00,420 --> 00:53:01,700
I mean, you kind of got it.

1384
00:53:01,700 --> 00:53:03,780
Okay, wait, hold on, hold on.

1385
00:53:04,420 --> 00:53:05,780
That's a ridiculous question.

1386
00:53:05,780 --> 00:53:08,340
Then, like, how do I describe snow?

1387
00:53:09,220 --> 00:53:11,300
All I've got so far is it's frozen water

1388
00:53:11,300 --> 00:53:13,380
that falls from the sky and accumulates on the ground.

1389
00:53:13,380 --> 00:53:13,620
But that's-

1390
00:53:13,620 --> 00:53:14,820
Well, I mean, also-

1391
00:53:14,820 --> 00:53:17,780
She's done nothing to capture the spirit of the thing.

1392
00:53:17,780 --> 00:53:18,100
Okay.

1393
00:53:18,100 --> 00:53:18,740
The magic of it.

1394
00:53:18,740 --> 00:53:20,900
And she's also sort of mischaracterized it, I think,

1395
00:53:20,900 --> 00:53:23,620
because, like, you don't always go to the food court.

1396
00:53:24,580 --> 00:53:28,580
Sometimes the food court is a dining destination.

1397
00:53:28,580 --> 00:53:29,300
Oh, I see.

1398
00:53:29,300 --> 00:53:29,700
It's not a-

1399
00:53:29,700 --> 00:53:31,140
Sometimes that's your sole purpose.

1400
00:53:31,140 --> 00:53:32,420
It's not a pit stop.

1401
00:53:32,420 --> 00:53:37,460
It's in between fucking Suncoast and the Sunglass Hut.

1402
00:53:37,940 --> 00:53:41,220
Like, sometimes it's just sort of why you went to the mall.

1403
00:53:41,220 --> 00:53:44,820
Okay, so let's do some flavor text to make it, like,

1404
00:53:44,820 --> 00:53:46,660
that much of a throwback in a world.

1405
00:53:46,660 --> 00:53:50,740
Imagine stepping into the Garden of Eden,

1406
00:53:51,300 --> 00:53:54,660
except instead of a bunch of shitty stuff,

1407
00:53:54,660 --> 00:53:57,940
like fruit and trees and everything,

1408
00:53:57,940 --> 00:54:03,540
you could reach out your hand and pluck some Chick-fil-A.

1409
00:54:04,180 --> 00:54:05,140
This is the food court.

1410
00:54:05,140 --> 00:54:06,740
You can eat at the Big Loafer.

1411
00:54:07,380 --> 00:54:10,500
You could eat at Orange Panda Express.

1412
00:54:11,700 --> 00:54:14,180
Other people probably don't know what the Big Loafer is, do they?

1413
00:54:14,180 --> 00:54:16,900
I love that you guys have moved on

1414
00:54:16,900 --> 00:54:19,060
away from beautiful Huntington, West Virginia,

1415
00:54:19,060 --> 00:54:21,460
the greatest little city in this nation of ours,

1416
00:54:21,460 --> 00:54:24,500
and yet your images of malls and food courts

1417
00:54:24,500 --> 00:54:27,060
are still indelibly locked to Huntington, West Virginia.

1418
00:54:27,060 --> 00:54:28,580
So Big Loafer, I guess,

1419
00:54:29,300 --> 00:54:31,460
how do you describe a Big Loafer to someone

1420
00:54:31,460 --> 00:54:32,820
who has never been to one?

1421
00:54:32,820 --> 00:54:33,320
Easy.

1422
00:54:34,260 --> 00:54:36,100
Pepperoni rolls and that's it.

1423
00:54:36,820 --> 00:54:37,540
What do you got?

1424
00:54:37,540 --> 00:54:39,380
Soda and pepperoni rolls, you in?

1425
00:54:39,380 --> 00:54:41,540
Like, fuck yeah, I'm in Big Loafer.

1426
00:54:41,540 --> 00:54:42,980
Thanks for the e-vite.

1427
00:54:42,980 --> 00:54:44,420
I think also next to the Big Loafer

1428
00:54:44,420 --> 00:54:46,340
was the specialty popcorn store.

1429
00:54:46,340 --> 00:54:49,940
Yeah, Caramel Corn with a K was the name of that store.

1430
00:54:50,820 --> 00:54:51,700
And it burned down.

1431
00:54:54,020 --> 00:54:56,820
It was the best smelling fire basically ever,

1432
00:54:56,820 --> 00:54:57,860
and also the loudest.

1433
00:54:58,420 --> 00:55:02,100
The Big Loafer, it has a thing called the Big Loafer

1434
00:55:02,100 --> 00:55:03,140
that you can buy there.

1435
00:55:04,260 --> 00:55:05,700
Yes, it is made of meatloaf.

1436
00:55:06,580 --> 00:55:12,260
And it also has cookies that are filled with chocolate

1437
00:55:12,260 --> 00:55:13,780
and pepperoni rolls.

1438
00:55:13,780 --> 00:55:15,780
So I guess just translate that to French.

1439
00:55:15,780 --> 00:55:18,500
Jamie Oliver, when he was shooting the TV show Fat City

1440
00:55:18,500 --> 00:55:19,700
in Huntington, West Virginia,

1441
00:55:20,660 --> 00:55:22,500
he went to the Big Loafer,

1442
00:55:22,500 --> 00:55:24,420
realized that he had failed his

1443
00:55:24,420 --> 00:55:27,060
it's a wonderful life-esque angel mission,

1444
00:55:27,060 --> 00:55:28,340
and then just like pulled the ripcord

1445
00:55:28,340 --> 00:55:30,580
and went back to heaven and disappeared on the spot.

1446
00:55:31,780 --> 00:55:35,220
Now, I wanna warn you about the sandwiches at Big Loafer.

1447
00:55:35,220 --> 00:55:37,140
They're a little pricey at $5.

1448
00:55:38,420 --> 00:55:39,460
Wow, really?

1449
00:55:39,460 --> 00:55:42,500
Yeah, well, that's what the Big Loafer is gonna cost you.

1450
00:55:43,380 --> 00:55:44,420
Because I love you guys,

1451
00:55:44,420 --> 00:55:47,620
I looked up this quick story on the Herald Dispatch

1452
00:55:47,620 --> 00:55:48,660
about the Big Loafer,

1453
00:55:48,660 --> 00:55:51,700
and here's a quote from the guy who runs Big Loafer.

1454
00:55:51,700 --> 00:55:55,540
"'I've estimated that about 40% of the people

1455
00:55:55,540 --> 00:55:58,820
"'who have walked by our restaurant have never tried it,'

1456
00:55:58,820 --> 00:55:59,940
"'Michael Burdick said.

1457
00:56:00,500 --> 00:56:04,100
"'A $5 investment in a sandwich is a lot

1458
00:56:04,100 --> 00:56:05,940
"'if you don't know what you're getting.

1459
00:56:06,660 --> 00:56:09,140
"'But once people have tried our food,

1460
00:56:09,140 --> 00:56:16,980
"'999 out of 1,000 are gonna go, wow.

1461
00:56:18,180 --> 00:56:20,260
"'They find it's a great value for their money.'"

1462
00:56:20,260 --> 00:56:24,420
Wow, am I going to have diarrhea for a month?

1463
00:56:24,420 --> 00:56:26,100
No, no, no, no, no.

1464
00:56:26,100 --> 00:56:26,580
What have I done?

1465
00:56:26,580 --> 00:56:27,060
What have I done?

1466
00:56:27,060 --> 00:56:27,860
$5 for this?

1467
00:56:28,420 --> 00:56:29,860
I've gotta call my wife.

1468
00:56:29,860 --> 00:56:31,220
If I wanted to get diarrhea,

1469
00:56:31,220 --> 00:56:32,900
I could probably get it for like 65 cents.

1470
00:56:33,460 --> 00:56:34,820
If I spent my money wisely.

1471
00:56:34,820 --> 00:56:35,860
God damn it.

1472
00:56:35,860 --> 00:56:39,220
This is a great comment on the fatalistic nature

1473
00:56:39,220 --> 00:56:40,740
of many West Virginians,

1474
00:56:40,740 --> 00:56:42,260
that they would actually think,

1475
00:56:42,900 --> 00:56:44,900
wait, I'm gonna put it into my body?

1476
00:56:44,900 --> 00:56:46,820
I'm not gonna pay $5 for that.

1477
00:56:48,100 --> 00:56:49,060
I'm just gonna turn it into poop.

1478
00:56:49,060 --> 00:56:50,740
What kind of library living where you think

1479
00:56:50,740 --> 00:56:52,900
of buying a sandwich as an investment?

1480
00:56:52,900 --> 00:56:53,380
Yeah.

1481
00:56:53,380 --> 00:56:55,300
It's a $5 investment in finding out

1482
00:56:55,300 --> 00:56:56,260
of this sandwich place.

1483
00:56:56,260 --> 00:56:58,500
Well, maybe that Big Loafer is gonna give you

1484
00:56:58,500 --> 00:57:03,540
the calories that you need to invent Facebook too.

1485
00:57:03,540 --> 00:57:04,820
The sequel to Facebook.

1486
00:57:05,540 --> 00:57:07,780
If you could, honey, then don't get a Big Loafer.

1487
00:57:07,780 --> 00:57:09,140
I don't know what's wrong with you.

1488
00:57:09,140 --> 00:57:09,940
Stop it.

1489
00:57:09,940 --> 00:57:11,220
You have to stop it.

1490
00:57:11,220 --> 00:57:12,660
Thank you so much for listening

1491
00:57:12,660 --> 00:57:15,300
to our Big Loafer fan cast, the Loaf Bros.

1492
00:57:15,300 --> 00:57:19,220
We hope you had a Loaf-ly time.

1493
00:57:20,420 --> 00:57:22,820
We wanna thank those of you-

1494
00:57:22,820 --> 00:57:25,860
Guys, this was a big episode for us.

1495
00:57:25,860 --> 00:57:26,100
Yeah.

1496
00:57:26,740 --> 00:57:28,660
Yeah, there was no loafing here.

1497
00:57:28,660 --> 00:57:29,780
We were just going for it.

1498
00:57:30,580 --> 00:57:33,220
We should drop this loaf and let people listen to it.

1499
00:57:33,220 --> 00:57:35,300
Okay, well, okay.

1500
00:57:36,260 --> 00:57:37,540
Thank you to people tweeting about the show

1501
00:57:37,540 --> 00:57:39,220
like Hamish Strong, Sarah Mool.

1502
00:57:40,100 --> 00:57:42,020
NBNBAM Wisdom is a Twitter account

1503
00:57:42,020 --> 00:57:43,540
that you should absolutely be following

1504
00:57:43,540 --> 00:57:46,340
because it just tweets quotes from our show

1505
00:57:46,340 --> 00:57:49,060
and it's every once in a while I'll catch myself

1506
00:57:49,060 --> 00:57:50,820
laughing at it and then feel like a real dickhead.

1507
00:57:52,180 --> 00:57:55,460
Emily Allen, Joe Smith, Grant S, Sarah Rollin,

1508
00:57:55,460 --> 00:57:58,420
Alex Robbins, Sunny Webster, James Elliott,

1509
00:57:59,700 --> 00:58:04,100
Maggie Rossetti, Josh Lang, Chris Traslavina,

1510
00:58:05,460 --> 00:58:06,420
and so many others.

1511
00:58:06,420 --> 00:58:07,940
Thank you for recommending our show

1512
00:58:07,940 --> 00:58:08,980
to your friends and family.

1513
00:58:08,980 --> 00:58:09,860
It means a lot.

1514
00:58:10,580 --> 00:58:12,500
And a big thanks to Cameron Esposito

1515
00:58:12,500 --> 00:58:13,700
for being our first desperate

1516
00:58:13,700 --> 00:58:15,780
for testing out these choppy waters.

1517
00:58:16,580 --> 00:58:20,180
If you have somebody that you want to see on the show,

1518
00:58:20,820 --> 00:58:22,260
I mean, we're not going to do this every week,

1519
00:58:22,260 --> 00:58:24,980
I don't think, but shoot us an email

1520
00:58:24,980 --> 00:58:27,780
at mbnbam at maximumfun.org

1521
00:58:27,780 --> 00:58:31,220
and we'll try to reach out.

1522
00:58:31,220 --> 00:58:31,780
We'll try to-

1523
00:58:31,780 --> 00:58:32,980
Make sure to check out her show,

1524
00:58:33,860 --> 00:58:35,860
MNBNPOW and Put Your Hands Together

1525
00:58:35,860 --> 00:58:38,980
and all the other awesome maximumfun.org shows.

1526
00:58:38,980 --> 00:58:41,940
Yeah, like The Goose Down, Sawbones,

1527
00:58:41,940 --> 00:58:43,940
Jordan and Jesse Go, Judge John Hodgman,

1528
00:58:43,940 --> 00:58:45,300
there's a grip of them.

1529
00:58:45,300 --> 00:58:46,020
So go check it out.

1530
00:58:46,020 --> 00:58:48,180
And a big thanks to John Roderick

1531
00:58:48,180 --> 00:58:49,940
and The Long Winters for these theme song,

1532
00:58:49,940 --> 00:58:51,780
It's a Departure, off the album,

1533
00:58:51,780 --> 00:58:53,140
Putting the Days to Bed.

1534
00:58:53,140 --> 00:58:56,420
It's a fine album, fine album,

1535
00:58:56,420 --> 00:58:59,540
sold where all albums are sold, I guess.

1536
00:58:59,540 --> 00:59:00,900
And also a big loafer.

1537
00:59:00,900 --> 00:59:01,300
They have a stack of them.

1538
00:59:01,300 --> 00:59:02,660
Also a big loafer.

1539
00:59:02,660 --> 00:59:04,020
It's like Starbucks

1540
00:59:04,020 --> 00:59:05,460
where they have the albums at the front,

1541
00:59:05,460 --> 00:59:08,580
but it's only Seattle-based indie rock.

1542
00:59:08,580 --> 00:59:13,940
And thank you so much for listening to our program.

1543
00:59:13,940 --> 00:59:15,380
It really means a lot to us.

1544
00:59:16,180 --> 00:59:18,500
Make sure to join us again next Monday

1545
00:59:18,500 --> 00:59:20,100
when we'll be back with you.

1546
00:59:20,100 --> 00:59:21,940
Until then, Griffin has a question

1547
00:59:21,940 --> 00:59:23,220
for you to think about and ponder.

1548
00:59:23,220 --> 00:59:26,340
Yeah, it was sent in by Jeff and Kami.

1549
00:59:27,380 --> 00:59:28,660
Thank you, Jeff and Kami.

1550
00:59:29,780 --> 00:59:32,180
It's by Yahoo Answers user Williams

1551
00:59:32,180 --> 00:59:33,300
who asks,

1552
00:59:33,300 --> 00:59:37,860
how much gum in my pubes is too much?

1553
00:59:37,860 --> 00:59:40,820
I'm Justin McElroy.

1554
00:59:40,820 --> 00:59:41,780
I'm Travis McElroy.

1555
00:59:41,780 --> 00:59:42,660
I'm Griffin McElroy.

1556
00:59:42,660 --> 00:59:43,860
It's been my brother, my brother, me.

1557
00:59:43,860 --> 00:59:44,820
Kiss your dad.

1558
00:59:44,820 --> 01:00:04,660
Swear on the lips.

1559
01:00:04,660 --> 01:00:06,580
Maximumfun.org.

1560
01:00:06,580 --> 01:00:07,620

Listener-supported.

1563
01:00:12,580 --> 01:00:14,180
Justin, what are you doing?

1564
01:00:14,180 --> 01:00:16,740
I'm strapping a chicken in my arm.

1565
01:00:16,740 --> 01:00:18,420
Heard there's some plague out west,

1566
01:00:18,420 --> 01:00:19,460
so I just wanted to, you know,

1567
01:00:19,460 --> 01:00:21,140
kind of get out ahead of it.

1568
01:00:21,140 --> 01:00:22,420
Justin, if you'd ever listened

1569
01:00:22,420 --> 01:00:24,420
to our medical history podcast,

1570
01:00:24,420 --> 01:00:26,420
Sawbones, where we talk about everything

1571
01:00:26,420 --> 01:00:28,420
from trepanation to bloodletting,

1572
01:00:28,420 --> 01:00:30,500
you would know that that is a ridiculous idea

1573
01:00:30,500 --> 01:00:31,540
and it will never work.

1574
01:00:32,500 --> 01:00:34,500
Sawbones, I haven't caught it.

1575
01:00:34,500 --> 01:00:34,980
Sawbones?

1576
01:00:35,700 --> 01:00:37,540
Yes, it's every Friday

1577
01:00:37,540 --> 01:00:38,980
on the Maximum Fun Network

1578
01:00:38,980 --> 01:00:40,740
and we record it together.

1579
01:00:42,420 --> 01:00:43,300
You a doctor or something?

1580
01:00:43,300 --> 01:00:43,940
I'm a doctor.

1581
01:00:43,940 --> 01:01:13,860
Yes.
