1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:30,640
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:46,640
Hello and welcome, my brother, my brother and me.

6
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:52,320
Uh, right show for the modern era. I'm your oldest brother, Kevin Spacey.

7
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:56,080
I'm your, I'm your middle-est brother.

8
00:00:56,080 --> 00:01:03,440
Ah, I got nothing. I'm Louisiana State Senator Jacob Sweetwater.

9
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:12,720
Listen, you can't make an omelet without breaking a few politics eggs.

10
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:15,360
Governor, you're drifting into Cosby. Of course, correct.

11
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:19,200
What an honor it is to have a House of Cards character.

12
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:23,360
Louisiana State Senator Jacob Sweetwater.

13
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:26,080
Senator Jacob Sweetwater on our program.

14
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:30,000
You've been privy to some of the machinations of, uh-

15
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,920
Dog machinations, son.

16
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:37,120
Yeah. Uh, what, what, what do you think is, has changed about Paul?

17
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:42,400
You've obviously been a Senator for, uh, 30 years, uh, and, and you've seen,

18
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:48,240
you know, some of the, the drama and I guess intrigue, uh, that's taking place on Capitol Hill.

19
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:52,160
I just say most folk ain't got the stomach for it.

20
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:52,960
Yeah.

21
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:57,040
I'm saying our countries and states being held by a bunch of-

22
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:59,360
What the fuck is going on?

23
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:00,480
What is all of this?

24
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:02,880
By a bunch of pussy fingers.

25
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:05,280
What is happening?

26
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:09,440
Man, Travis is good at improv.

27
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:13,440
Something happens for 20 seconds he doesn't understand and he starts crying.

28
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:16,400
I don't know what you're referencing.

29
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:20,480
This is a good joke to say yes and then say no, help, stop.

30
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:22,400
Help, help, I need an adult.

31
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:27,200
Um, I've never, I've seen, I've seen two episodes of House of Cards.

32
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:28,400
I shouldn't say I've never seen it.

33
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:29,200
All I remember-

34
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:29,920
Which member?

35
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:33,280
Oh God. S1, E4, S1, E8.

36
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:37,520
Um, I, I don't remember anything about it.

37
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:40,160
Didn't really leave a mark with me.

38
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:43,600
I know people are all crazy about it, but Kevin Spacey, that's not what you sound like.

39
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:45,440
You know what I mean?

40
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:47,360
Yeah. Why doesn't he just sound like himself?

41
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:48,800
Yeah, he's a liar.

42
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:51,200
You sound imposing already.

43
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:57,040
Like just regular old standard Kevin Spacey basic sounds pretty imposing.

44
00:02:57,040 --> 00:03:01,760
I don't understand why you have to sound all Louisiana state Senator Jacob Sweetwater.

45
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:08,960
How sweet would it be in the last episode if he like, he becomes president of the United States

46
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:16,160
and then he flips the switch and nukes everybody on earth from his secret underground bunker

47
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:19,360
and then he puts on some sunglasses and says, that's right.

48
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:22,080
This whole time I was K-Pax.

49
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:24,640
He flies into his spaceship.

50
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:28,960
It's all been leading up to that.

51
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,520
He's been in so many things.

52
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:34,240
Yeah. A lot of things.

53
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:35,600
He's an American treasure.

54
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:39,200
You know, we knew someone on that House of Cards.

55
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:41,200
Did we?

56
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:44,560
Yeah. Nick Reynolds played a cameraman in an episode.

57
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:45,120
Oh wow.

58
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:48,080
Yeah. So pretty starstruck.

59
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:50,160
Big ups to Nick Reynolds if you're listening.

60
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:50,640
Shout out.

61
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:55,440
But this show isn't for Nick Reynolds.

62
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:55,600
No.

63
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:58,720
It's for you, the listening public.

64
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:02,880
So we can take your queries and turn them alchemy-like into wisdom.

65
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:05,200
Let's get started.

66
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:12,720
I travel on a lot of planes, trains, buses, and other forms of transportation.

67
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:16,400
When I do so, I like to watch shows on my computer and some of those shows have nudity

68
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:20,720
or violence like Game of Thrones, Archer, or The Wire.

69
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:24,960
Assuming there are no children around, is it okay to watch these kinds of things

70
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:27,280
where other people could maybe see it?

71
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:29,040
And that's from Confused Coach.

72
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:33,520
You really can't lump those three shows in together because yes,

73
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:39,680
The Wire can be exceedingly violent and Archer can be pretty violent,

74
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:43,360
but only one of those shows has fisting in it.

75
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:51,040
I feel like Game of Thrones though at this point has entered into the public zeitgeist enough

76
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:55,600
that someone would see the shit that goes on in that show,

77
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:57,440
but then go, well, it's Game of Thrones.

78
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:58,400
What would you expect?

79
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:07,840
Nah, there are some scenes of nudity that are lengthy enough

80
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:13,760
that I would become uncomfortable if someone in the seat next to me was watching and enjoying them.

81
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:17,920
Well, at that point, you just slightly turn the screen towards them

82
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:19,840
and then just stare into their eyes.

83
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:21,440
Huh? Huh? Huh? Huh? Yeah.

84
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:23,040
Hubba, hubba, hubba, right?

85
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:24,480
She's elbow deep.

86
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:25,760
Hubba, hubba.

87
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:27,920
I watched-

88
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:29,920
I'm sorry, did you just say hubba, hubba?

89
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:32,080
Yeah, hubba, hubba.

90
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:38,720
I watched a girl with a dragon tattoo on a plane to America from Germany and-

91
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:40,640
Did you cry?

92
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:42,720
What?

93
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:43,360
Did you cry?

94
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:45,440
At the movie?

95
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:45,680
Yeah.

96
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:47,440
It's not like a sat-

97
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:50,800
You know, I said girl with the dragon tattoo, not like the notebook.

98
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:51,360
No, I know.

99
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:58,080
Okay, I was watching it and there are some pretty uncomfortable scenes in that movie

100
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:05,200
and there was one I tried to fast forward through and I tried to fast forward through it

101
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:08,640
because it was just really, really wrecking my shop and so I fast forwarded through it

102
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:13,920
but I went way too far in the movie and so I rewound and I rewound back to that scene

103
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:18,480
and I said, oh fuck, and so I fast forwarded again and I went way too far again

104
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:24,800
and so I rewound and I rewound right back to that scene again so I did myself-

105
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:25,920
To a casual observer.

106
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:28,160
To a casual observer.

107
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:30,480
I was like, I wanted to live in that scene.

108
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:33,440
I wanted to build a summer home in that scene and enjoy it.

109
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:40,400
If there was like a 1 16th slow motion option available on the airplane VCR,

110
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:44,800
I would have indulged in that scene and just like become a resident there.

111
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:48,800
But what's more embarrassing, that you did that or that I watched Dark Shadows?

112
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,520
I mean, why would that be bad?

113
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:52,800
It's a pretty bad movie.

114
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:58,160
I wasn't deeply impressed with it, but everyone sitting on the plane could watch me

115
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:02,480
enjoy Johnny Depp's awful performance in that movie and enjoy what I did.

116
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:04,800
You know what's funny about that, Jarvis?

117
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:13,840
Last time I flew home from Europe, there was a guy one row up and one to the left of me

118
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:19,600
who was watching, he was like an old guy and he was watching the Lone Ranger

119
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:24,800
and like I could tell like he picked it and I knew it was a bad movie

120
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:30,240
and I felt my heart went out to him because like I had to watch someone watch a bad movie

121
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:33,840
and just like the whole wave of disappointment, the back and forth that they go through

122
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:36,320
when you realize like, oh, maybe it's not such a bad movie.

123
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:41,840
And then later you think, oh, I guess I'm watching this whole thing.

124
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:49,200
But is that worse than watching someone watch two medieval prostitutes

125
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:53,920
just wail on each other vis-a-vis their whole fists?

126
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:55,360
Well, here's the thing.

127
00:07:55,360 --> 00:08:01,440
The magical mystery thing about Travel is like your encounter with these people

128
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:05,040
is so brief in like the great scheme of things.

129
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:06,480
Unless it's a trans...

130
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:11,280
Okay, yeah, maybe considering the fullness of fucking time.

131
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:14,320
I'm saying think about all the people I was on an airplane with

132
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:16,240
that watched me cry to dark shadows, right?

133
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:17,680
And then-

134
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:20,320
Hey Trav, can we talk about how much you're crying lately?

135
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:23,200
Because it's like a lot.

136
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:26,720
Listen, it's a common phenomenon that when you watch the movies on the plane,

137
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:30,080
I don't know if it's the air pressure or like the oxygen they pump in,

138
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:33,120
but people tend to have stronger emotional reactions to shit

139
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:35,120
that they would not feel in real life.

140
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:39,200
I think if you're watching extended scenes of nudity on a plane, it's creepy.

141
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:39,680
I think so too.

142
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:42,640
Personally, I think it's something you should not do.

143
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:45,680
The other people around you, I mean, even if they're not children,

144
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:49,520
like they may just like not appreciate that,

145
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:53,120
or maybe like, I don't know, spoilers, you know?

146
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:57,840
There should be software embedded on each plane.

147
00:08:57,840 --> 00:09:01,840
I watched Iron Man 3 on a plane and it was like Iron Man 3 plane edition.

148
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:04,560
By which I mean all the scenes of helicopters exploding

149
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:07,040
and basically that whole scene where the plane explodes in the sky

150
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:09,440
and Iron Man has to catch all those people are gone

151
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:11,280
and the movie is 40 minutes long.

152
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:15,200
There should be software in the plane that hacks into your iPad

153
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:22,000
and your Nexus and your global tab and it gets in there

154
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:25,040
and it can be called Fist Nanny.

155
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:28,080
And if there's a scene of fisting, it will automatically-

156
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:29,120
Or Nanny Fist.

157
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:33,520
Nanny Fist and it will automatically fast forward through that scene

158
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:36,240
so that you don't upset your neighbors.

159
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:37,760
How about it?

160
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:38,800
How about the technology?

161
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:40,640
How about the technology?

162
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:48,160
That new Liam Neeson movie is gonna be a weird one to watch on a plane

163
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:49,120
because they can't-

164
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:51,360
The thing is, they won't ever be able to reference

165
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,560
that nonstop takes place on a plane.

166
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:59,040
So it'll just be very curious as to why he's locked in this small room,

167
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:00,800
why no one will let him out.

168
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:02,880
This tubular room.

169
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:03,840
This tubular room.

170
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:07,120
It's on a new sky train.

171
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:08,800
Do you guys want a Yahoo?

172
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:09,200
Please.

173
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:16,080
This Yahoo was sent in by Kent Siri.

174
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:17,200
Thanks, Kent.

175
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:19,840
It's by Yahoo Answers user Katya who asks,

176
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:24,400
why do some idiots think Toy Story is real?

177
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:27,200
Yeah, that's right.

178
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:28,960
Toy Story is a myth, okay?

179
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:29,760
Additional details.

180
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:31,600
Just to let you know, I do love Toy Story,

181
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:34,400
but it's so annoying when people say it's based on real life.

182
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:37,280
What?

183
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:37,600
Wait.

184
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:42,720
I am fucking annoyed at how many people are coming up to me every day.

185
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:47,680
How often is this scenario recurring in your life?

186
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:49,600
This happens to me daily, Trav.

187
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:51,760
People come up to me and they're like,

188
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:54,960
you know Woody was based on my dad.

189
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:59,200
I say, was your dad a marionette and also a fictional?

190
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:01,920
And they just look at me this dark stare, like sort of a blank.

191
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:03,200
Mm-hmm.

192
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:05,840
Probably like your face was when you were watching Dark Shadows.

193
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:06,400
I'm crying.

194
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:10,480
Sort of like a hollowed out, sort of hurting, deep hurting.

195
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:13,360
Listen, he just wanted to be loved, you guys,

196
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:16,400
but like you've been cursed and he was going through a lot of shit.

197
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:16,640
Sure.

198
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:19,120
This stuff is deep.

199
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:21,840
Now wait, when was the last time you saw Toy Story?

200
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:23,600
Because I do not think curses.

201
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:26,720
He's talking about Dark Shadows again.

202
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:30,240
I'm actually talking about my Dark Shadows Toy Story crossover fanfic.

203
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:33,840
I would imagine that if you really think about Toy Story,

204
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:39,920
that their sentience is a curse, you know?

205
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:44,080
Like they become sentient when we're not around.

206
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:48,560
When we are there, they lose sentience.

207
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:50,960
They don't, they can't be aware of us really

208
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:57,280
because their mind and body shut down whenever we're present, right?

209
00:11:57,280 --> 00:11:58,560
They lose sentience.

210
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:02,400
Now, Justin, I would argue that in fact, they are quite aware of us

211
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:06,800
because of the issues with Andy that Woody and Buzz are dealing with.

212
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:17,520
Can you imagine a more horrifying fate than to suddenly be a living corpse,

213
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:20,960
unable to perambulate or affect the world around you,

214
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:27,920
but instead having to just soak in whatever inhumanity the gigantic humans can visit on you

215
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:29,600
and being powerless to stop?

216
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:31,200
That is what that movie's about.

217
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:32,720
It's like that show Attack on Titan.

218
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:34,640
You guys watch that anime?

219
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:37,840
No, I'm 33.

220
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:46,240
I think those toys, if they had hung around much longer in Andy's life,

221
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:53,760
then they basically would have been a bunch of creepy sex watchers, right?

222
00:12:53,760 --> 00:13:00,720
You know, for a fact, 100% not a question,

223
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:05,520
every character you love from that movie was there the first time Andy masturbated.

224
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:06,720
Every single one of them.

225
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:07,200
Every single-

226
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:08,240
I thought I turned you-

227
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:10,320
It's weird, I turned all these guys around.

228
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:12,000
I'm starting to think that they're sentient.

229
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:14,880
Guys, what did we just see?

230
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:17,520
Is that a new game?

231
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:18,240
I don't like it.

232
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:18,720
Is that a new toy?

233
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:24,320
He went to infinity and beyond and then a little further than that, I would say.

234
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:29,120
Does Mattel make a new fleshy Bop-It?

235
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:32,640
Like, oh, guys, you sweet, sweet angels.

236
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:35,520
Listen, Andy's got an itch down there, guys, apparently,

237
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:37,600
and we're the only ones who can help him.

238
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:38,240
Let's go!

239
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,560
I would watch that movie before I would watch Planes.

240
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,520
Now, toys gather round.

241
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:48,720
Gather round, I want to introduce you to our new friend.

242
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:50,000
Andy just bought her.

243
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,280
Her name is Fleshlight.

244
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:52,480
Come over here, Fleshlight.

245
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:56,480
Hey, guys.

246
00:13:58,240 --> 00:13:58,800
Kill me.

247
00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:00,800
Kill me, please.

248
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:01,920
I'll feed some shit.

249
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:08,000
Because he's got a big rubbery mouth, it's hard for him to talk.

250
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:09,360
Oh, it's a heat.

251
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:10,320
Yeah.

252
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:13,360
Yeah, of course.

253
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:19,280
That's the way God made me.

254
00:14:19,280 --> 00:14:22,560
Man, of all the wigs for us not to have an Extreme Restraints ad.

255
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:30,320
Do you have any advice for a 23-year-old female who just started playing Puchamon

256
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:32,080
Blue for the first time?

257
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:38,160
I didn't get into it when it was released because I was busy getting beat at Goldeneye.

258
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:41,360
I named the nemesis formerly known as Gary after my older brother

259
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:44,800
so I could finally kick his ass at a video game Pocket Monster style.

260
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:48,560
I have no prior Pokémon experience.

261
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:49,680
That's from Catch You Later.

262
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:53,520
Griffin, I'm going to step away.

263
00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:55,440
No, I'm absolutely useless in this department.

264
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:59,680
Griffin, you don't have any Pokémon advice?

265
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:04,640
No, but it's like if I went to fucking...

266
00:15:07,520 --> 00:15:09,600
Let me think of a famous athlete real quick.

267
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:11,520
If I went to Peyton Manning.

268
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:12,400
Touchdown Nelson.

269
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:13,520
If I went to Touchdown Nelson.

270
00:15:13,520 --> 00:15:14,880
Refrigerator Steven.

271
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:18,880
If I went to Refrigerator Steven and was like, teach me how to block in football,

272
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:19,840
I'd be like, all right.

273
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:22,800
And then he would start dropping this expert technique on me.

274
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:28,160
You're saying you can't get your head back down to her level.

275
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:28,640
That's right.

276
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:29,920
Is that what you're saying?

277
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:30,960
I'm so elevated.

278
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:36,960
There are matrices and I just...

279
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:37,520
I don't know.

280
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:38,240
It's complicated.

281
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:38,960
Get a Pikachu.

282
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:39,600
That one's pretty good.

283
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:43,840
Plus, Griffin doesn't give that advice out for free anymore

284
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:45,840
ever since he started doing his self-help books.

285
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:48,080
I can help.

286
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:55,440
So you just get them.

287
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:59,280
Get them and I think you use the psychic against the earth

288
00:15:59,280 --> 00:16:00,160
and that's pretty good.

289
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:02,720
The best one is Beedrill.

290
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:04,720
Beedrill is the best Pokémon.

291
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:05,120
That's right.

292
00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:08,000
Mathematically, it's the best one.

293
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:08,720
Yeah.

294
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:11,600
You got to get male and female so they can do it.

295
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:12,800
Okay.

296
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,240
That feature's not in Pokémon.

297
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:18,640
You get more Pokémon from the do it

298
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:21,280
and then you raise them and you sell them for food.

299
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:21,440
Yeah.

300
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:24,880
Or you just turn them into food yourself.

301
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:27,680
Just eat your Game Boy.

302
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:28,400
Eat your Game Boy.

303
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:30,800
I don't think you should eat your Game Boy.

304
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:32,560
Make sure to leave your Game Boy in the sun

305
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:34,480
so your Pokémon don't get cold.

306
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:34,880
That's right.

307
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:37,440
And so if they're plant type, they can grow.

308
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:39,600
Bury it in the earth.

309
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:41,360
Bury it there when they die.

310
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:42,960
Leave all your Pokémon at the daycare.

311
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:45,200
Walk around completely unarmed.

312
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:49,280
Don't forget to leave your Pokémon in your will to somebody.

313
00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:51,920
That is important or they go to the government.

314
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:55,200
You got to release your Pokémon when they start to get old

315
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:56,960
because then if you don't, they'll die

316
00:16:57,520 --> 00:16:59,920
and that gets really expensive after a while

317
00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:02,320
handling all those Pokémon funerals.

318
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:06,080
You're going to have the federales down your neck after a grip.

319
00:17:06,080 --> 00:17:06,720
Just kind of...

320
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:07,440
Oh, I mean Pokémon...

321
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:09,600
Don't forget to feed your Pokémon.

322
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:10,880
Pokémon coffins aren't cheap.

323
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:12,240
Yeah.

324
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:13,520
And they're all specially sized.

325
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:14,800
And they're all very specially sized.

326
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:15,200
You think you're...

327
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:18,000
I was watching an episode of Animal Cops Houston.

328
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:18,320
Yeah.

329
00:17:18,320 --> 00:17:20,240
Where this dude had all these Pokémon

330
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:21,120
and he wasn't feeding them.

331
00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:22,960
He just had them tied up out back.

332
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:23,440
Yeah.

333
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:26,000
And like the cops came in and they collected...

334
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:29,280
It was 45 Pokémon that they took away from this guy's place.

335
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:31,360
Well, he wasn't even close to catching them all.

336
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:33,120
No, no. And it was all the same one.

337
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:34,000
It was all Beedrills.

338
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:37,920
That would be the worst one to collect en masse.

339
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:39,520
He was living in terror.

340
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:40,560
Yeah, I can imagine.

341
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:43,600
I would...

342
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:44,880
I need a Pokémon.

343
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:46,320
Yeah, sure.

344
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:47,440
What Pokémon would you guys eat?

345
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:49,520
Ash.

346
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:51,840
Wait a minute.

347
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:54,240
Sorry.

348
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:55,520
Un momento.

349
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:57,200
No, I mean, Travis has a great point.

350
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:59,840
If every creature in that world is a Pokémon,

351
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:04,880
then we can assume that people are Pokémon.

352
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:06,240
You look at like a Mr. Mime.

353
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:08,720
That's just a guy.

354
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:10,320
That's just a mime.

355
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:12,480
That's just a man who's a mime.

356
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:15,440
Just because you are that profession, silly as it may be,

357
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:18,000
it doesn't give people the right to encapsulate you.

358
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:18,560
You know what I mean?

359
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:20,160
Doesn't really seem fair.

360
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:22,560
In the back of my girlfriend's house,

361
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:25,680
there's a Mimosa tree that she saved

362
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:27,520
from being cut down by a private company.

363
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:29,920
She fought them after they cut down every other tree

364
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:31,920
in her neighborhood's respective backyards

365
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:33,840
to put in a parking lot nobody uses,

366
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:35,200
and saved just this one.

367
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:39,600
The problem is there's one kid who always comes by

368
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:42,080
and climbs, kicks, and break the branches off of it.

369
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:45,440
How do we keep this guy from hurting

370
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:48,000
the last green shade they've got, Anthony?

371
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:51,040
Anthony, you can't own a tree.

372
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:53,120
Next question.

373
00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:56,160
Listen, read the Giving Tree.

374
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:58,000
The Giving Tree, that tree is stoked.

375
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:58,240
Yeah.

376
00:18:58,880 --> 00:18:59,360
Okay?

377
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:01,680
You can't interrupt the cycle of Giving Tree.

378
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:02,560
Every tree has a boy.

379
00:19:02,560 --> 00:19:04,720
Do you think the Giving Tree is happy to be kicked

380
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:06,160
at heaven's branches?

381
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:07,680
What is it giving at that point?

382
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:08,640
I understand, little man.

383
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:09,520
Oh, listen.

384
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:10,480
You need this more than-

385
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:13,200
Ah, ah, ah, fuck, god damn it.

386
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:15,040
Okay, yep, nope, yep, nope.

387
00:19:15,040 --> 00:19:16,640
You're right, you're right.

388
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:17,760
No, you're right.

389
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:18,480
I deserve that.

390
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:19,520
I brought it on myself.

391
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:21,200
Here, have a Mimosa.

392
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:26,640
Oh, I watched Slavery Times and I didn't do anything.

393
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:28,000
I earned this.

394
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:32,960
I could have spoken up.

395
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:33,200
Yeah.

396
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:35,840
You can't own a tree.

397
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:38,320
You gotta let a tree do what a tree-

398
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:40,240
I mean, you want shade from it.

399
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:42,640
This kid wants to take out his preteen anger.

400
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:44,480
Well, first of all, if you're saying,

401
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:47,040
we need to rescue this tree for shade,

402
00:19:47,040 --> 00:19:51,120
like, build a house, you goober.

403
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:52,800
Houses are like all-

404
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:53,840
Are you a bird?

405
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:56,800
They're all shade all the time, and that's pretty cool.

406
00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:00,640
Why is there a kid that has a fucking vendetta

407
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:01,760
against your tree?

408
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:03,360
Because it's the only tree in the neighborhood.

409
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:05,680
The kid was able to get all the rest of them chopped down.

410
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:07,760
The kid's a captain of industry, by the way.

411
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:08,800
We didn't mention that.

412
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:11,120
Little tycoon.

413
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:11,840
Here's the thing.

414
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:14,800
The way that natural selection and evolution works

415
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:19,680
is that as new enemies develop,

416
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:21,920
the creatures develop defense mechanisms.

417
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:23,520
If you protect this tree,

418
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:27,200
you are robbing us of man-eating trees in 3,000 years.

419
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:27,440
Yeah.

420
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,360
Wow, that's true, Travis.

421
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:30,320
That's a circle of life.

422
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:31,840
Yeah, you gotta let these trees develop

423
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:33,440
their own natural defenses.

424
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:35,280
I think the circle of life terminates

425
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:37,040
once they're man-eating trees,

426
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:38,160
because we need them.

427
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:40,000
It is the ultimate catch-22,

428
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,480
because we need them to breathe, don't we?

429
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:43,760
We can't just kill all of them,

430
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:44,960
because then we're killing ourselves.

431
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:46,400
That's true.

432
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:47,440
Maybe it's harder to breathe

433
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:48,480
in their neighborhood right now.

434
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:49,920
Definitely is.

435
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:52,640
Maybe that's why this kid is losing his goddamn mind.

436
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:54,320
His kid's not hitting the tree.

437
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:56,480
He's putting his mouth flush with the tree

438
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:56,960
and just like,

439
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:00,240
oh, it's so good.

440
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:01,440
He's breaking the branches

441
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:03,200
and sucking the oxygen straight out of it.

442
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:05,200
Oh, it's so good right off the tap.

443
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:10,400
Child.

444
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:10,880
Children.

445
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:13,200
They're awful.

446
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:14,720
They are just the worst.

447
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:15,920
Just terrible.

448
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:17,440
And I'll, this is, I mean,

449
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:20,000
the solution is right there.

450
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,760
I didn't want to spoil the answer,

451
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:23,680
but it's pretty obvious to me

452
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:25,920
what you should do to keep the kid off the tree.

453
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:27,120
When the kid climbs the tree,

454
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:28,000
you climb the kid.

455
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:30,240
No, you put some jelly on it.

456
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:30,880
Oh, God.

457
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:32,800
Put some jelly on the tree,

458
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:34,720
on the branches and on the trunk.

459
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:38,400
He goes to like grab the tree or fuck with it,

460
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:40,320
and he's going to come back

461
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:42,320
with a fistful of tree jelly.

462
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:42,960
What is this?

463
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:43,520
He'll think.

464
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:44,320
Do you mean sap?

465
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:45,600
Then okay.

466
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:46,960
No, tree jelly.

467
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:47,840
He won't know about sap.

468
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:48,400
He's too young.

469
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:49,680
Oh, fair point.

470
00:21:49,680 --> 00:21:50,720
And the tree jelly,

471
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:51,840
he'll totally get the concept.

472
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:53,520
He'll be, well, Travis,

473
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:55,920
he won't have to be Angela Lansbury.

474
00:21:55,920 --> 00:21:57,040
There's jelly on a tree.

475
00:21:58,160 --> 00:21:59,120
I'm not the one who said

476
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:01,200
he wouldn't understand the concept of sap.

477
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:03,360
Let me throw this out.

478
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:05,680
Elaborate tree costume.

479
00:22:05,680 --> 00:22:06,400
Haunt the kid.

480
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:10,320
Okay, but that's also like gross.

481
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:12,000
You're going to roll up to his house.

482
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,680
You're going to pound on his door late at night.

483
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:15,040
He's going to answer and say,

484
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:17,120
I'm a tree sprite.

485
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:18,000
And you're going to teach him

486
00:22:18,560 --> 00:22:20,640
about like the beauty of trees.

487
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:22,880
Travis, please, a spriggan, please.

488
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:24,480
Okay.

489
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:25,440
Then at the end of the night,

490
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:27,060
kill him.

491
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:30,720
Wait a minute.

492
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:31,200
No, hold on.

493
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:32,240
No, that's a perfect crime.

494
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:34,400
How many kids do you think die

495
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:36,480
because of tree-related injuries every year?

496
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:37,920
You can just write that one off.

497
00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:38,880
The detectives come.

498
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:39,920
They're like, let me see.

499
00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:42,880
Sap, a little bit of tree jelly around the window frame.

500
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:44,240
Yeah, it looks like another tree.

501
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:44,960
God damn it.

502
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:46,160
Got another one.

503
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:47,120
Well, we need him to live.

504
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:48,720
So there's nothing really can really do about it.

505
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:54,820
Trees.

506
00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:58,000
How scary is that scene in Poltergeist, by the way?

507
00:22:58,800 --> 00:23:00,320
When the tree kills the kid?

508
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:00,880
He doesn't.

509
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:02,160
I mean, that kid should be dead.

510
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:03,200
Can we all agree about that?

511
00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:05,680
I always thought that that was sort of bullshit

512
00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:08,640
that they just sort of like pull him out

513
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:09,520
of the clutches of the tree.

514
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:10,720
And he's like, no, I'm all right.

515
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:14,080
That tree looked super scary, super deadly.

516
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:16,800
It could have killed you like 100 times over, and it didn't.

517
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:17,840
Nice try, spirits.

518
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:20,480
Put your back into it.

519
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:24,240
Kill a kid for once, why don't you?

520
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:24,960
For once.

521
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:25,680
You guys want a Yahoo?

522
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:26,480
Sure.

523
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:29,280
This Yahoo was sent in by Drew Davenport,

524
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:30,480
an Emerald member.

525
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:31,200
Thank you, Drew.

526
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:31,760
It's by Yahoo!

527
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:33,680
Answer's user Ashley, who asks,

528
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:36,400
I need new kind of sad songs from the heart

529
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:37,680
for teens to listen to.

530
00:23:37,680 --> 00:23:38,400
Any ideas?

531
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:40,160
One more time.

532
00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:42,960
I need new kind of sad songs from the heart

533
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:44,320
for teens to listen to.

534
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:47,280
See, I love this, because it's not asking for new songs.

535
00:23:47,280 --> 00:23:49,680
It's asking for a new kind of song.

536
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:53,680
Like sad dubstep.

537
00:23:53,680 --> 00:23:55,600
Can I get some dark shadows ballads?

538
00:23:56,560 --> 00:23:58,800
What if you listen to Christmas Shoes,

539
00:23:58,800 --> 00:24:01,440
but also at the same time, because that's too sad?

540
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,560
Listen to Shaggy's It Wasn't Me underneath it

541
00:24:04,560 --> 00:24:05,040
at the same time.

542
00:24:05,040 --> 00:24:05,840
It wasn't shoes.

543
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:08,640
It wasn't shoes.

544
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:10,240
It wasn't your mom.

545
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:11,680
It's a song about dying.

546
00:24:11,680 --> 00:24:13,840
Picture this, she was dying from cancer.

547
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:19,200
And my mommy's got the cancer.

548
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:20,080
So get some shoes.

549
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:24,800
She's gonna be walking with Jesus.

550
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:25,680
So buy the shoes.

551
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:29,840
I don't have enough money.

552
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:30,720
Just steal the shoes.

553
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:35,440
Yeah, daddy, I got her some red shoes.

554
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:38,000
She uses them to walk on the floor.

555
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:41,440
Picture this, we were both butt naked.

556
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:45,120
Why were you both in CPS show, dog?

557
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:46,720
So buy the shoes.

558
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,920
They got her in attention.

559
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:50,720
So buy the shoes.

560
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:53,440
What?

561
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:57,440
I mean, there were some fucking classic standbys back in the day.

562
00:24:57,440 --> 00:24:59,840
I don't know if anybody's still making music like that,

563
00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:01,200
because I don't think it's sustained.

564
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:03,200
Is Bone Sustained Harmony still making music?

565
00:25:05,040 --> 00:25:05,600
Not really sad.

566
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:06,800
That song didn't bum me out.

567
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:07,680
No, yes.

568
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:09,760
See You at the Crossroads made me sad every time.

569
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:11,360
I'm saying See You at the Crossroads is beautiful

570
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:13,360
because it's kind of sad, but it's also like,

571
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:15,040
yeah, man, you know what?

572
00:25:15,040 --> 00:25:16,400
I'll see you at the Crossroads.

573
00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:19,680
But I miss my little child, y'all.

574
00:25:19,680 --> 00:25:21,120
That is what it's like.

575
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:22,560
I miss my little child, y'all.

576
00:25:22,560 --> 00:25:25,680
You know, the song that made me sad all the time,

577
00:25:25,680 --> 00:25:27,200
only kind of sad when I was a teen,

578
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:30,720
that worked for me, was Time After Time by Miss Cindy Lauper.

579
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:31,760
Did it really?

580
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:33,280
Ooh, that one'll get to me.

581
00:25:33,280 --> 00:25:37,120
I preferred the Matchbox 20 version, but that's fine.

582
00:25:38,160 --> 00:25:40,560
Oh, man, that one'll touch me deep down.

583
00:25:40,560 --> 00:25:41,440
That one gets to me.

584
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:43,200
Is there something in the content of the song

585
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:47,040
or do you liken it back to like a sad memory?

586
00:25:47,040 --> 00:25:48,080
Sad, it's sad.

587
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:50,240
Musically, it's sad.

588
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:52,400
The key, it's in a sad key.

589
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:53,280
Yeah, what is it?

590
00:25:53,280 --> 00:25:56,880
J, it's in the key of, aw.

591
00:25:56,880 --> 00:25:58,880
I put this in a depressed J.

592
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:00,240
There's always the cure, I guess.

593
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:02,800
Yeah, they got some sad jams.

594
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:04,560
I just don't think any, I don't think,

595
00:26:04,560 --> 00:26:07,040
all the music nowadays is all just like fun

596
00:26:07,040 --> 00:26:09,600
and like, well, fun by the band Fun.

597
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:11,600
And they don't make sad songs, really.

598
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:15,120
What did teens, do teens wanna listen to sad music?

599
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:16,240
I don't, see, that's the thing.

600
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:18,000
I don't think teens wanna listen to music.

601
00:26:18,560 --> 00:26:22,720
No, teens wanna listen to music and mashups.

602
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:25,040
And like back in, I feel like getting sad

603
00:26:25,040 --> 00:26:28,160
was like all the music, like Damien Rice came out

604
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:29,920
and like set the world on a sad fire.

605
00:26:30,560 --> 00:26:34,000
What about, what's that?

606
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:37,360
Where, where can my baby be?

607
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:38,720
Yeah, Last Kiss.

608
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:40,800
Last Kiss, ooh, that's a sad one.

609
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:45,200
Yeah, that one always bummed me out because it existed.

610
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:52,880
What about, what about I Can't Make You Love Me

611
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:53,920
by Miss Bonnie Rice?

612
00:26:53,920 --> 00:26:55,440
Oh, fuck.

613
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:59,360
Come on, that one'll get you, whoa.

614
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:02,480
Is Jolene kinda sad?

615
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:07,120
Jolene is sad, but it's also so good

616
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:09,760
that it gets you pumped, you know?

617
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:12,720
What about Love on the Rocks by Sir Neil Diamond?

618
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:15,600
That's not bad.

619
00:27:16,560 --> 00:27:18,000
The theme song does step by step.

620
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:22,960
Sometimes I worry that, okay, wait a minute.

621
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:23,760
Landslide.

622
00:27:26,160 --> 00:27:28,400
Next question, that one's answered.

623
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:29,760
Tears in Heaven.

624
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:33,760
Can I tell you guys an honest story about Tears in Heaven?

625
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:37,200
Is it gonna be you making fun of Tears in Heaven

626
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:40,720
because like, I don't think that'll play very well.

627
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:42,160
I'm making fun of myself.

628
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:47,040
I was, I had a screen that popped out of my butt.

629
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:51,600
Oh, that was a great story, Justin.

630
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:54,640
A screen that popped out of my window

631
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:56,880
and just like the top half came out

632
00:27:56,880 --> 00:27:59,280
and I was trying to get it back in

633
00:27:59,280 --> 00:28:00,400
and I should've just let it be,

634
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:06,240
but I couldn't, I couldn't let it just be there

635
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:07,680
because I'm having a child

636
00:28:07,680 --> 00:28:10,080
and I was obsessed with the idea

637
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:14,000
that my child would, with Tears in Heaven,

638
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,400
and I couldn't let it, I couldn't let it go.

639
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:18,720
It like, I don't know, it really got to me for some reason.

640
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:20,080
Like that song got stuck in my head.

641
00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:21,600
I was like, I can't let this happen.

642
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:22,880
I have to fix this screen.

643
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:24,800
It's really important, but I just shut the window.

644
00:28:24,800 --> 00:28:26,240
You know what, babies aren't gonna like.

645
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:29,520
I know, I know, but what if I forgot the screen was broken?

646
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:31,120
I couldn't handle it.

647
00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:33,200
What if the screen fell on your kid

648
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:35,120
and then it laid on top of him

649
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:36,320
and he like wriggled around

650
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:38,320
and he like cheese grated himself?

651
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:40,160
Or what if like because of that screen

652
00:28:40,160 --> 00:28:41,920
your kid didn't get into a good college?

653
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:44,720
I don't wanna think about this anymore.

654
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:46,400
I really do need to get some money.

655
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:46,880
Come on.

656
00:28:56,880 --> 00:28:57,840
Get on now.

657
00:28:57,840 --> 00:28:58,560
Get on in there.

658
00:28:58,560 --> 00:28:59,360
Get on now.

659
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:00,400
Come on, move along now.

660
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:05,120
We had to raise ourselves some campaign finances.

661
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:07,440
Jacob's sweet spot.

662
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:10,080
Wally Parker is a new concept in our way.

663
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:12,800
Contemporary eyeglasses.

664
00:29:12,800 --> 00:29:14,000
They're extremely affordable

665
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:15,920
and they're fashioned forward.

666
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:17,360
You're gonna have to take that from them.

667
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:19,760
I would not trust me to tell you

668
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:20,320
it's fashion forward right now.

669
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:22,480
Just what fashion is in general.

670
00:29:23,040 --> 00:29:25,200
Right now I'm wearing a shirt from Tybee Island

671
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:27,200
that says island time state of mind.

672
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:30,640
I cannot be trusted.

673
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:34,480
We're supported by Warby Parker,

674
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:38,320
who's a friend of ours with a new concept in glasses.

675
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:42,400
Most glasses are too expensive

676
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:43,920
and that makes them terrible

677
00:29:43,920 --> 00:29:45,680
because you can't wear them without being scared

678
00:29:45,680 --> 00:29:47,360
they're gonna break or something.

679
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:48,720
But Warby Parker,

680
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:52,720
you get these really hot fashion forward prescription glasses

681
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:54,480
and they just cost 95 bucks.

682
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:57,840
Now here's the thing about Warby Parker

683
00:29:57,840 --> 00:29:58,480
that makes them cool.

684
00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:00,960
They have this like home trial program

685
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:02,400
where you get five pairs of glasses

686
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:03,200
and they send them to your house.

687
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:05,120
You pick out five pairs that you're into.

688
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:06,000
They send them to your house.

689
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:06,880
You try them all on.

690
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:08,080
You ask your friends,

691
00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:10,160
what does this make me look like?

692
00:30:10,160 --> 00:30:11,440
Does this make me look smart?

693
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:12,480
Will Dylan like these?

694
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:16,080
And then you put the ones you don't want back in a box

695
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:17,120
and you ship them off to them

696
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:20,160
and you for free,

697
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:21,280
it's not even a big deal.

698
00:30:21,280 --> 00:30:22,960
And maybe Dylan won't like them

699
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:24,080
and then you just do it again.

700
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:26,080
And then you put Dylan in the box

701
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:28,160
and you ship Dylan back to Warby Parker

702
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:28,720
and you say,

703
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:30,000
okay, Dylan, while you're there,

704
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,160
just pick out something you do like for God's sakes.

705
00:30:32,800 --> 00:30:34,080
Enjoy Warby Parker,

706
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:35,200
now you have a Dylan.

707
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:41,200
They have a prescription polarized lenses for 150 bucks

708
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:42,720
and for every one they sell,

709
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:45,040
they give a pair of glasses to somebody in need.

710
00:30:45,040 --> 00:30:46,000
That's crazy.

711
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:49,520
So go to warbyparker.com slash my brother

712
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:53,120
and you're gonna get three day shipping for free

713
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:56,880
on those five free home try-on frames.

714
00:30:56,880 --> 00:30:58,400
There were a lot of words in there though.

715
00:30:58,400 --> 00:31:00,000
No, no, no, it was a tongue twister.

716
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:01,440
Tryin', okay?

717
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:02,800
I'm out there tryin'.

718
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:07,360
And you think about that.

719
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:09,280
You're listening to this on Monday probably.

720
00:31:09,280 --> 00:31:10,320
If you do this right now,

721
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:11,920
you could have new shades by Friday.

722
00:31:11,920 --> 00:31:13,120
Don't even worry about it

723
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:14,480
because we hooked you up.

724
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:18,000
Warbyparker.com slash my brother,

725
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:19,280
a one word, obviously.

726
00:31:19,280 --> 00:31:20,720
And then as with other things,

727
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:23,680
if you end up using this because we told you to,

728
00:31:23,680 --> 00:31:24,320
let us know.

729
00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:25,280
Like tweet at us,

730
00:31:26,160 --> 00:31:28,160
send a picture of your new sweet frames.

731
00:31:28,160 --> 00:31:30,080
Yeah, and include Warby Parker in it

732
00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:33,680
because that makes us look like fuckin' big deals.

733
00:31:33,680 --> 00:31:36,160
Okay, so you're dying.

734
00:31:36,160 --> 00:31:36,640
Yep.

735
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:37,520
Oh, shit.

736
00:31:37,520 --> 00:31:41,200
Sorry, I didn't mean to break it to you guys this way.

737
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:42,080
You're dying.

738
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:44,480
And the thing about that is

739
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:45,440
you don't care what happens

740
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:46,960
to most of your earthly possessions,

741
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:49,040
but I have a question for you, friends.

742
00:31:49,040 --> 00:31:52,000
As you slowly or speedily,

743
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:53,600
there's no way of knowing a sin

744
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:55,680
towards that golden reward

745
00:31:55,680 --> 00:31:57,920
that meets us on the other side of the beyond.

746
00:31:57,920 --> 00:31:59,440
I ate almost an entire Domino's pizza

747
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:00,560
by myself yesterday.

748
00:32:00,560 --> 00:32:01,680
Okay, so you're in this kind of-

749
00:32:01,680 --> 00:32:03,280
You could only be dead by dawn.

750
00:32:03,280 --> 00:32:03,920
Choo-choo.

751
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:06,560
Let's hope Griffin makes it to the end of the episode.

752
00:32:06,560 --> 00:32:08,160
But here's the question, friends,

753
00:32:08,160 --> 00:32:10,240
and I know it's not one we like to confront,

754
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:12,560
but what happens to your Pokemon when you're gone?

755
00:32:12,560 --> 00:32:14,000
I take them with me.

756
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:14,720
No, you can't take them-

757
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:15,760
Like Egyptian style.

758
00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:17,280
I won't be buried with my Pokemon.

759
00:32:17,280 --> 00:32:18,800
I wanna be buried with your Pokemon,

760
00:32:18,800 --> 00:32:20,960
but even if you do wanna be buried with your Pokemon,

761
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:23,200
you're gonna have to leave some specific instructions

762
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:25,920
and the only people who can help you do that

763
00:32:25,920 --> 00:32:26,880
is legal zoom.

764
00:32:27,760 --> 00:32:30,240
When I die, let's just talk about this.

765
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:31,440
Let's just get this over with.

766
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:34,000
When I die, I want my entire spirit

767
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:35,520
to be turned into code

768
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:37,280
and then uploaded into a Pokemon game.

769
00:32:38,160 --> 00:32:38,720
There.

770
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:39,920
Is that so much to ask?

771
00:32:39,920 --> 00:32:40,400
That's where it is.

772
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:41,440
Don't burn my body.

773
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:42,480
Don't scatter my ashes.

774
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:44,240
Just leave my corpse on the ground.

775
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:45,600
That's not me anymore.

776
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:48,080
Legal zoom helps you incorporate or form an LLC

777
00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:50,480
with their simple questionnaire starting at $99.

778
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:52,960
You have to build a company, right?

779
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:54,000
If you wanna build a company,

780
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:55,600
legal zoom can help you out on that.

781
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:58,800
But more importantly, for our current discussion,

782
00:32:58,800 --> 00:33:01,760
you can create a will starting at just $69

783
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:04,800
or even a living trust quickly and easily

784
00:33:04,800 --> 00:33:06,320
and get peace of mind and protection.

785
00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:08,080
Now, I know it's uncomfortable

786
00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:09,520
to think about this sort of thing,

787
00:33:09,520 --> 00:33:13,280
but imagine the fun of,

788
00:33:13,280 --> 00:33:15,840
I think it would be worth the 69 bucks

789
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:19,040
just to have a will in your possession

790
00:33:19,040 --> 00:33:22,400
that dictates what happens to your Pokemon

791
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:24,080
in the event of your death.

792
00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:24,960
Like you could just have that.

793
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:26,080
Especially if you make that

794
00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:27,680
and then completely forget about it

795
00:33:27,680 --> 00:33:29,200
and like 50 years from now,

796
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:31,840
your like loved ones are all bereft

797
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:32,720
and you're sitting there and like

798
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:34,080
for the reading of the will

799
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:35,680
and then it gets to the section on Pokemon

800
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:37,040
and it's like, God, that asshole.

801
00:33:37,920 --> 00:33:39,280
And they don't know what Pokemon is

802
00:33:39,280 --> 00:33:40,240
cause they're future people.

803
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:41,200
So they think it's valuable.

804
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:42,720
So they start a hunt looking for it.

805
00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:44,080
Whoa.

806
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:44,960
Then they find it

807
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:46,320
and then they turn on the cartridge

808
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:47,760
and they're like, oh, this is a pretty fun game.

809
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:48,960
And then on route six,

810
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:50,480
they're wandering around in the tall grass

811
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:52,080
and then a wild Griffin McElroy appears.

812
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:53,120
It's my spirit.

813
00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:55,200
It's been encoded to the cartridge.

814
00:33:56,080 --> 00:33:57,520
Now, legal zoom is not a law firm,

815
00:33:57,520 --> 00:33:59,920
but they can connect you with a third party attorney

816
00:33:59,920 --> 00:34:01,600
and provide you with self-help services.

817
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:04,720
And for even more savings,

818
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:06,240
I know those prices already seem low.

819
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:07,440
They seem low to me.

820
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:11,200
I'm 33, but in many ways I'm a child.

821
00:34:11,200 --> 00:34:13,120
So if you'd asked me how much it will cost

822
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:14,320
before this commercial,

823
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:17,440
I would have said probably $8 or a million.

824
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:20,080
So these prices are great,

825
00:34:20,080 --> 00:34:20,880
but for more savings,

826
00:34:20,880 --> 00:34:23,920
you can type my brother into the referral box at checkout.

827
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:26,240
Don't put this stuff off.

828
00:34:26,240 --> 00:34:27,600
It's not fun to think about,

829
00:34:27,600 --> 00:34:28,960
but just go do it.

830
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:30,080
Go get your Pokemon sorted out.

831
00:34:30,080 --> 00:34:31,520
Go to legalzoom.com.

832
00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:34,960
Now, and use the coupon code mybrother.

833
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:36,000
Hey guys, when I die,

834
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,640
would you sprinkle my ashes on Keev or Sutherland

835
00:34:38,640 --> 00:34:39,520
without him knowing it?

836
00:34:40,160 --> 00:34:42,160
While he sleeps a little bit every night.

837
00:34:42,160 --> 00:34:43,360
Just like sneak up behind him

838
00:34:43,360 --> 00:34:45,360
and kind of put a little in his hair.

839
00:34:45,360 --> 00:34:46,080
And he's like, what was that?

840
00:34:46,080 --> 00:34:46,880
And be like, what?

841
00:34:46,880 --> 00:34:48,640
Nothing, nothing, nothing.

842
00:34:48,640 --> 00:34:50,320
My dandruff is really bad lately.

843
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:51,680
Damn it, Chloe.

844
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:55,040
This special message is for Midge

845
00:34:55,680 --> 00:34:57,920
and it's from a retired sea captain.

846
00:34:59,600 --> 00:35:00,080
Terrific.

847
00:35:00,080 --> 00:35:02,480
A retired sea captain says,

848
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:04,640
since that night, I called you a dummy at the green-

849
00:35:04,640 --> 00:35:06,560
Come on, you can get me a voice.

850
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:09,760
But I mean, what am I going to do like-

851
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:10,800
Give me a voice.

852
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:12,560
Give me a damn voice, Griffin.

853
00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:15,920
Since that night,

854
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:18,800
I called you a dummy at the green mill

855
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:22,000
and told you something else too.

856
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:25,920
I knew that nothing was better than you.

857
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:29,840
Two kittens laughing together.

858
00:35:29,840 --> 00:35:33,920
Griffin describing shoplifting.

859
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:35,040
I love you.

860
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:38,320
Retired, not disgraced sea captain.

861
00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:41,280
Since that night,

862
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:42,560
I called you a dummy at the green mill

863
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:43,680
and told you something else too.

864
00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:45,200
I knew that nothing was better than you.

865
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:46,560
Two kittens and laughing together.

866
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:48,080
Griffin describing shoplifting.

867
00:35:48,080 --> 00:35:48,640
I love you.

868
00:35:49,360 --> 00:35:50,800
You know, your regular voice

869
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:52,560
does sound a lot like a sea captain.

870
00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:53,040
That's true.

871
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:54,560
Congratulations on your love, Midge,

872
00:35:54,560 --> 00:35:56,240
and retired sea captain.

873
00:35:56,240 --> 00:35:58,400
Uh, I got a question for you.

874
00:35:58,400 --> 00:35:59,920
Have you ever wondered about the value

875
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:02,560
of placing an ad on a popular podcast

876
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:03,520
like My Bim Bam?

877
00:36:03,520 --> 00:36:03,920
Yes.

878
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:05,840
You want to know if it's right for your business?

879
00:36:05,840 --> 00:36:06,560
Here's a hint.

880
00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:07,120
Probably.

881
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:08,400
Probably.

882
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:11,280

889
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:29,200
They, uh, we had such a big response

890
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:30,320
to Not A Real Job.

891
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:30,720
Yeah.

892
00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:33,840
Like, lots of people, uh, listen to that.

893
00:36:33,840 --> 00:36:37,680
It's a podcast about, you know, marketing and advice.

894
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:39,600
And we had a huge response from people

895
00:36:39,600 --> 00:36:41,760
who listened to it and, like, really enjoyed it.

896
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:44,000
It was really, I, um, still, I guess,

897
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:46,080
background, we did an ad for them,

898
00:36:46,080 --> 00:36:47,360
like, three or four episodes ago.

899
00:36:47,360 --> 00:36:48,480
And so they did a whole episode

900
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:51,360
about the return on that investment.

901
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:52,800
And I listened to it.

902
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:54,960
It was really, like, it was super interesting.

903
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:56,640
Like, I think if you're a fan of podcasts

904
00:36:56,640 --> 00:36:59,440
and, you know, you hear a lot of advertising,

905
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:00,480
it would be fascinating.

906
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:03,840
But as a fucking, the person who made that shit,

907
00:37:03,840 --> 00:37:06,800
like, hearing, hearing how it actually works

908
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:08,720
for the people who advertise on our show,

909
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:09,680
it was like, I don't know.

910
00:37:09,680 --> 00:37:11,120
It was super, super fascinating.

911
00:37:11,120 --> 00:37:12,800
So yeah, check that, check that out.

912
00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:16,160
I'm Cameron Esposito, and each week

913
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:20,160
I'm joined by my fellow podcasters, Rhea Butcher.

914
00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:20,960
That's me.

915
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:22,160
And Ricky Carmona.

916
00:37:22,160 --> 00:37:23,520
I am Ricky Carmona.

917
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:25,600
We talk about action in sci-fi movies

918
00:37:25,600 --> 00:37:27,440
on a little show called Wham Bam Pow.

919
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:29,840
You can find it on MaximumFun.org.

920
00:37:29,840 --> 00:37:31,360
It's amazing.

921
00:37:31,360 --> 00:37:32,400
Super fun.

922
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:32,960
True dat.

923
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:35,120
Reviews, news, and stuff you can use.

924
00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:44,240
I'm a 20-year-old male in college,

925
00:37:44,240 --> 00:37:48,000
and I want to start wearing prescription-less glasses.

926
00:37:48,640 --> 00:37:49,520
My eyes work fine.

927
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:52,320
I just know that if I wear a pair that suit me,

928
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:54,720
I can look pretty damn good.

929
00:37:55,520 --> 00:37:57,520
Sadly, my girlfriend thinks that this is the,

930
00:37:58,160 --> 00:38:01,200
quote, douchiest idea I have ever had.

931
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:03,600
If I plan to wear them, just what I need

932
00:38:03,600 --> 00:38:05,200
to look a little more suave and smart,

933
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:09,280
exam, party, et cetera, is this socially and morally sound,

934
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:11,760
or should I just be thankful for the 2020,

935
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:14,080
this is from Born to Be, bespectacled.

936
00:38:14,080 --> 00:38:18,240
Listen, we've all, all of us with great vision,

937
00:38:18,240 --> 00:38:19,840
with great vision like myself,

938
00:38:20,560 --> 00:38:25,840
I have willed the fates to dim these perfect jellies

939
00:38:25,840 --> 00:38:32,320
so many times, just so I can have some cool-looking glasses.

940
00:38:33,600 --> 00:38:35,040
And you know what, friends?

941
00:38:35,040 --> 00:38:38,000
It just, maybe it's because I wear Gunner shades.

942
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:38,480
Protect me from the-

943
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:39,440
Gunner optics.

944
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:41,920
Protecting your gamer from gamer rays.

945
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:43,680
Maybe it's that.

946
00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:46,240
I don't know, but I have wanted this,

947
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:49,760
and there's just no way of doing it.

948
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:51,680
Let me break it down as to why I think

949
00:38:51,680 --> 00:38:53,840
it is usually referred to as douchey.

950
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:56,240
You didn't put in the time.

951
00:38:57,040 --> 00:38:57,920
I put in the time.

952
00:38:57,920 --> 00:39:00,160
I've been wearing the glasses since second grade.

953
00:39:00,160 --> 00:39:01,680
Yeah, they're cool fucking now.

954
00:39:02,240 --> 00:39:03,600
You know when they weren't cool?

955
00:39:03,600 --> 00:39:05,120
But any time before now.

956
00:39:06,080 --> 00:39:07,360
It's like, what I don't want to see

957
00:39:07,360 --> 00:39:08,800
is like 50 years from now,

958
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:12,960
like the new look is like those corrective,

959
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:14,000
like leg braces.

960
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:16,160
And people will perfectly fine legs

961
00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:18,000
are wearing them like you assholes.

962
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:20,880
No, that's a great comparison.

963
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:22,800
Can I have designer crutches?

964
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:24,960
Because I think it'll make me seem erudite.

965
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:28,640
Can I carry around a designer colostomy bag

966
00:39:28,640 --> 00:39:29,920
that's non-functioning?

967
00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:31,520
Glasses are face crutches.

968
00:39:31,520 --> 00:39:31,760
Yeah.

969
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:34,240
You're mocking the handicap.

970
00:39:34,240 --> 00:39:35,200
Think about that.

971
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:37,520
And the thing is, you can then take them off

972
00:39:37,520 --> 00:39:39,120
and not have to wear them anymore.

973
00:39:39,120 --> 00:39:39,840
I cannot.

974
00:39:40,720 --> 00:39:43,440
If I do that, I can no longer drive.

975
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:44,480
It's like blackface.

976
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:45,760
It's glasses face.

977
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:46,960
It's where you're at right now.

978
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:48,240
You've got shiny face.

979
00:39:48,240 --> 00:39:50,720
It's super, super not like blackface,

980
00:39:50,720 --> 00:39:51,440
like basically yellow.

981
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:52,720
No, it's exactly like blackface.

982
00:39:52,720 --> 00:39:54,480
It's basically blackface.

983
00:39:54,480 --> 00:39:57,440
It's basically, in short, like just exactly like blackface.

984
00:39:57,440 --> 00:40:00,960
With all the socioeconomic repercussions

985
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:04,560
of that parallel, it is exactly the same thing.

986
00:40:04,560 --> 00:40:04,800
Okay.

987
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:06,640
Super not.

988
00:40:06,640 --> 00:40:09,360
But basically is exactly the same.

989
00:40:09,360 --> 00:40:11,520
I wished for glasses too,

990
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:14,320
because I think it would help me to pull my look together.

991
00:40:14,320 --> 00:40:17,280
But try to think two steps ahead.

992
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:19,440
This is my thing for 20 forward.

993
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:21,680
I think that people should be,

994
00:40:21,680 --> 00:40:24,000
I think it's important to think forward too.

995
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:25,520
Don't just think about the now.

996
00:40:25,520 --> 00:40:28,240
Think two steps ahead when someone asks you,

997
00:40:28,240 --> 00:40:29,840
oh, you wear glasses too.

998
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:31,760
Why do you wear glasses?

999
00:40:31,760 --> 00:40:34,160
And then I know that doesn't seem like

1000
00:40:34,160 --> 00:40:36,000
a super likely conversation starter,

1001
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:36,800
but you never know.

1002
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:39,600
As a glasses wearer, the occurrence of someone saying,

1003
00:40:39,600 --> 00:40:40,800
how strong are your glasses?

1004
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:42,080
Here, let me try them on.

1005
00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:44,400
It's like, it's pretty damn common.

1006
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:48,400
Do you guys know that ever since I was very young,

1007
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:51,680
I have always harbored a secret suspicion

1008
00:40:51,680 --> 00:40:55,440
that sometime I would try on someone else's glasses.

1009
00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:56,160
Oh, that's the dream.

1010
00:40:56,800 --> 00:40:57,760
And my, right?

1011
00:40:57,760 --> 00:40:58,000
That's the dream.

1012
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:01,920
And my vision would suddenly be like better than it is now.

1013
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:02,960
Can I tell you though?

1014
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:03,360
Perfect.

1015
00:41:03,360 --> 00:41:04,160
Can I tell you?

1016
00:41:04,160 --> 00:41:05,840
That is actually what happened to me.

1017
00:41:05,840 --> 00:41:08,080
I was like, yeah, let me see your glasses.

1018
00:41:08,080 --> 00:41:08,880
Let me try those on.

1019
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:09,440
And I tried them on.

1020
00:41:09,440 --> 00:41:11,520
I was like, holy fuck, I can see through walls.

1021
00:41:11,520 --> 00:41:13,520
Is this what it was supposed to be the whole time?

1022
00:41:13,520 --> 00:41:14,560
And I went and got a vision test.

1023
00:41:14,560 --> 00:41:17,200
They're like, yeah, dog, your shit is jacked.

1024
00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:18,960
You have like no cones in there.

1025
00:41:19,600 --> 00:41:20,160
And so I-

1026
00:41:20,160 --> 00:41:20,960
It's all wrong.

1027
00:41:20,960 --> 00:41:21,840
It's all wrong.

1028
00:41:21,840 --> 00:41:22,640
What's going on?

1029
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:26,480
I have dog eyes basically.

1030
00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:29,920
And so I got glasses and now they're back to normal.

1031
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:31,440
Do you guys wear contacts?

1032
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:31,840
Fuck no.

1033
00:41:31,840 --> 00:41:32,240
Sometimes.

1034
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:34,640
Griffin, could you even do that?

1035
00:41:34,640 --> 00:41:35,760
Touch my eyeball?

1036
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:36,000
Nope.

1037
00:41:36,880 --> 00:41:37,600
Like every day?

1038
00:41:37,600 --> 00:41:39,280
Yeah, I couldn't.

1039
00:41:39,280 --> 00:41:43,280
When I was a child and I took the vision test to determine if I needed glasses,

1040
00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:47,120
I wanted glasses so bad that for like the next six years,

1041
00:41:47,120 --> 00:41:51,200
I was so worried that I skewed the test just at like,

1042
00:41:51,200 --> 00:41:52,560
I was like, do I really need these?

1043
00:41:52,560 --> 00:41:53,120
Or did I?

1044
00:41:53,120 --> 00:41:55,120
And then like, I realized like, oh no, I do.

1045
00:41:55,120 --> 00:41:58,480
Cause I'm blind without them because I can't see shit without them.

1046
00:41:58,480 --> 00:42:03,280
Now, one thing you could do is you could start wearing prescription glasses

1047
00:42:03,280 --> 00:42:06,960
because I heard that Elton John started wearing prescription

1048
00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:12,320
glasses to look like Buddy Holly and eventually he needed them to see.

1049
00:42:12,320 --> 00:42:15,360
Like his eyes adjusted so that he needed them.

1050
00:42:15,360 --> 00:42:15,840
Yeah.

1051
00:42:15,840 --> 00:42:16,800
So I guess what I'm saying is-

1052
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:18,880
I would call that putting in the time.

1053
00:42:18,880 --> 00:42:19,200
Yeah.

1054
00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:21,120
You commit to it, to messing up your eyes permanently.

1055
00:42:21,120 --> 00:42:23,040
Or just like throw some acid in your eyes.

1056
00:42:24,080 --> 00:42:24,320
Yeah.

1057
00:42:24,320 --> 00:42:25,120
Like a joker?

1058
00:42:25,120 --> 00:42:26,400
Don't do that.

1059
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:27,040
Don't do that.

1060
00:42:27,840 --> 00:42:28,320
One eye.

1061
00:42:28,320 --> 00:42:29,040
One eyeball.

1062
00:42:29,040 --> 00:42:29,520
One eye.

1063
00:42:29,520 --> 00:42:30,080
Yeah, that's fine.

1064
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:34,560
And then you can wear a monocle and that's like four times as cool as glasses.

1065
00:42:34,560 --> 00:42:43,440
Um, I, um, can you wear cosmetic contact lenses?

1066
00:42:45,040 --> 00:42:48,080
Can you wear like non-prescription contact lenses?

1067
00:42:48,080 --> 00:42:49,520
Only if they're clear.

1068
00:42:50,160 --> 00:42:50,320
Yeah.

1069
00:42:50,320 --> 00:42:50,720
No, no, no.

1070
00:42:50,720 --> 00:42:56,960
I'm not talking about like fucking now my, now my eyeballs look like playing card spades.

1071
00:42:56,960 --> 00:43:00,320
Like, no, it just, just regular old contact lenses.

1072
00:43:00,320 --> 00:43:03,520
So now I'm not allowed to wear my spade contacts anymore?

1073
00:43:03,520 --> 00:43:08,000
No, you can wear David Spade contacts that make your eyes look like David Spade's eyes,

1074
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:11,440
which are the most beautiful eyes God ever created.

1075
00:43:11,440 --> 00:43:14,640
I have contacts that actually make my eyes look like little David Spades.

1076
00:43:14,640 --> 00:43:15,600
Little David Spades.

1077
00:43:15,600 --> 00:43:16,560
They're so sad.

1078
00:43:16,560 --> 00:43:17,280
It's haunting.

1079
00:43:18,240 --> 00:43:20,080
They're like the time after time of eyes.

1080
00:43:21,360 --> 00:43:24,320
My dear friend has asked me to officiate his upcoming wedding.

1081
00:43:24,320 --> 00:43:29,040
However, I'm not exactly qualified and pretty sure he only asked me due to a conflict with

1082
00:43:29,040 --> 00:43:30,880
the brother for the position of best man.

1083
00:43:30,880 --> 00:43:35,680
Anyway, God ordained for like eight bucks, but I still have no idea what I'm doing.

1084
00:43:35,680 --> 00:43:40,240
What should I do during this most sacred ceremony with a captive audience full of loved ones

1085
00:43:40,240 --> 00:43:42,160
as from makeshift minister?

1086
00:43:42,160 --> 00:43:43,600
You know who crushed this?

1087
00:43:43,600 --> 00:43:44,160
Our papa.

1088
00:43:44,720 --> 00:43:46,480
Our papa, Clint McElroy.

1089
00:43:46,480 --> 00:43:50,240
Married me away, gave me away, did it without crying too.

1090
00:43:50,240 --> 00:43:54,880
I thought that fool was going to blubber like Danny Glover.

1091
00:43:54,880 --> 00:43:56,080
No, he kept his shit together.

1092
00:43:56,080 --> 00:43:57,760
He kept it on lock.

1093
00:43:57,760 --> 00:44:02,240
In fact, I was actually a little disappointed by his total stone face lack of emotion.

1094
00:44:02,800 --> 00:44:04,640
He was crying down the back of his throat.

1095
00:44:04,640 --> 00:44:06,560
He was inwardly crying.

1096
00:44:06,560 --> 00:44:07,280
You know, it was great.

1097
00:44:07,280 --> 00:44:12,240
He actually was he had to sit in the corner after the ceremony for 30 minutes and just

1098
00:44:12,240 --> 00:44:15,760
cry to get it all because he'd stored it up and it was like drowning.

1099
00:44:15,760 --> 00:44:16,880
It was a hard cry.

1100
00:44:18,240 --> 00:44:20,160
It was an unattractive leap.

1101
00:44:20,160 --> 00:44:24,800
I tell you, the thing that dad did that I was really impressed by that I think is he

1102
00:44:24,800 --> 00:44:26,240
did a little bit of scat in the middle.

1103
00:44:26,240 --> 00:44:28,880
Well, he farted pleasantly.

1104
00:44:29,760 --> 00:44:30,160
What?

1105
00:44:30,160 --> 00:44:31,840
No, they said it couldn't be done.

1106
00:44:35,200 --> 00:44:37,920
He didn't make it about himself.

1107
00:44:37,920 --> 00:44:43,280
He made it about like he gave them a ceremony that would make them happy.

1108
00:44:43,280 --> 00:44:47,040
And I think when you have a captive audience like that, I know this would be hard for me

1109
00:44:47,680 --> 00:44:51,680
is like to make the ceremony like the Justin McElroy show.

1110
00:44:51,680 --> 00:44:54,480
Like, hey, you're going to listen to me talk for 15 or 20 minutes.

1111
00:44:54,480 --> 00:44:57,440
Like strap in because I love this attention.

1112
00:44:57,440 --> 00:44:57,840
I need it.

1113
00:44:58,880 --> 00:45:03,360
You know, I tell you what, our officiant, Jeremy Dubin, like we had a couple of meetings

1114
00:45:03,360 --> 00:45:07,120
with him where we just sat down and he was like, so what you know, what kind of ceremony

1115
00:45:07,120 --> 00:45:07,680
do you want?

1116
00:45:08,320 --> 00:45:10,800
And like we said, well, we'd like to have this kind of thing.

1117
00:45:10,800 --> 00:45:13,600
And we've seen this at a wedding before and we'd like to try that.

1118
00:45:13,600 --> 00:45:18,960
And he was like a little bit of scat in the middle, but it was like, you know, that way

1119
00:45:18,960 --> 00:45:22,000
we got a pretty customized wedding ceremony.

1120
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:23,600
That was exactly what we wanted.

1121
00:45:23,600 --> 00:45:24,160
You know what I mean?

1122
00:45:24,160 --> 00:45:26,320
Instead of like, I'll surprise you.

1123
00:45:26,880 --> 00:45:29,120
Yeah, I think actually that's great advice, Trav.

1124
00:45:29,120 --> 00:45:35,040
The best thing you could do, I think, is talk, start talking now to the bride and groom about

1125
00:45:35,040 --> 00:45:38,640
sort of what sort of ceremony would make them the happiest.

1126
00:45:38,640 --> 00:45:43,040
Because if you can serve them, not only will that make them really happy, but the ceremony

1127
00:45:43,040 --> 00:45:48,000
is going to feel like them, which I think for both of you guys, like that was one of

1128
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:52,240
the things that I really liked about both of your weddings is they felt like you.

1129
00:45:52,240 --> 00:45:55,920
Like they it didn't feel like a ceremony made for somebody else.

1130
00:45:55,920 --> 00:45:58,800
They felt very specific to you guys.

1131
00:45:58,800 --> 00:46:01,440
I know it sounds like I'm trying not to cry, but I'm actually trying not to burp.

1132
00:46:01,440 --> 00:46:09,120
So if all else fails, you could do like some 90s stand up comedy.

1133
00:46:09,760 --> 00:46:10,000
Yeah.

1134
00:46:10,560 --> 00:46:12,800
What is the deal with food at weddings?

1135
00:46:14,080 --> 00:46:15,360
It's good because it's wedding.

1136
00:46:15,360 --> 00:46:17,200
Make sure you get super Jesusy too.

1137
00:46:18,800 --> 00:46:19,840
Lean really, really.

1138
00:46:19,840 --> 00:46:20,720
You're going to feel.

1139
00:46:20,720 --> 00:46:23,280
Revelation shit, not like a.

1140
00:46:23,280 --> 00:46:27,680
No, get deep down in revelations, bust out like a Versa to a Leviticus.

1141
00:46:28,800 --> 00:46:32,880
You're going to feel an urge to not do that because they're going to tell you explicitly

1142
00:46:32,880 --> 00:46:33,760
not to do that.

1143
00:46:34,320 --> 00:46:35,520
You just got to push through.

1144
00:46:36,240 --> 00:46:39,120
Just got to push through their demands and requests.

1145
00:46:39,120 --> 00:46:42,400
Also just know that wedding guests love it when you run long.

1146
00:46:42,400 --> 00:46:42,960
Love it.

1147
00:46:42,960 --> 00:46:43,280
Love it.

1148
00:46:43,280 --> 00:46:43,760
Love it.

1149
00:46:43,760 --> 00:46:44,400
Love it.

1150
00:46:44,400 --> 00:46:45,360
They love it.

1151
00:46:45,360 --> 00:46:48,800
If you get on a free will and jazz oddesty, just talk about the Jesus.

1152
00:46:48,800 --> 00:46:49,760
Talking about Jesus.

1153
00:46:49,760 --> 00:46:51,840
Maybe do a quick invitational.

1154
00:46:51,840 --> 00:46:58,640
Nothing like you don't want it to be like more about Jesus than the people who are getting

1155
00:46:58,640 --> 00:46:58,960
married.

1156
00:46:58,960 --> 00:47:03,280
But if you want to do just a quick invitational and see if anybody's going to step out of the

1157
00:47:03,280 --> 00:47:04,800
way, feel free to ask.

1158
00:47:04,800 --> 00:47:05,520
You know what I mean?

1159
00:47:05,520 --> 00:47:08,960
If they're in your way, if they're slowing down your role, just ask the bride and groom

1160
00:47:08,960 --> 00:47:12,000
to kind of step to the side while you scat a little bit.

1161
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:17,360
And the best place to do your scat invitational is right after they've exchanged rings and

1162
00:47:17,360 --> 00:47:21,120
vows, but right before you say, I now pronounce you man and wife.

1163
00:47:22,640 --> 00:47:24,400
Just to really give it that drop at the end.

1164
00:47:24,400 --> 00:47:28,880
Just like one last trial that everybody has to go through and then we can go drink.

1165
00:47:29,760 --> 00:47:34,560
It would also be great if you could arrange something like have a plant in the audience

1166
00:47:34,560 --> 00:47:37,200
that you've like built a skit into.

1167
00:47:37,200 --> 00:47:37,680
That's fun.

1168
00:47:37,680 --> 00:47:38,960
Oh, a fun skit.

1169
00:47:38,960 --> 00:47:39,440
Yeah.

1170
00:47:39,440 --> 00:47:40,880
Everybody loves skits.

1171
00:47:40,880 --> 00:47:43,280
Mid ceremony, do an entire Easter pageant.

1172
00:47:43,280 --> 00:47:47,920
That's something you can do complete with crucifixion scene.

1173
00:47:48,640 --> 00:47:50,800
And then wait three days.

1174
00:47:50,800 --> 00:47:52,240
And now I pronounce you man and wife.

1175
00:47:52,240 --> 00:47:57,120
My wife before, in a weird coincidence, my wife before we got married actually came to

1176
00:47:57,120 --> 00:48:04,080
our church a couple of times and she was, she's a Catholic.

1177
00:48:04,080 --> 00:48:08,400
When she found out about the invitational, when she witnessed that firsthand, she was

1178
00:48:08,960 --> 00:48:09,600
horrified.

1179
00:48:09,600 --> 00:48:10,080
Yeah.

1180
00:48:10,080 --> 00:48:14,640
Because suddenly there's a, it's confusing when you go to a Catholic church because there's

1181
00:48:14,640 --> 00:48:19,920
a lot of, there's a lot of moves and choreography that everybody else seems to know that you

1182
00:48:19,920 --> 00:48:20,640
don't know.

1183
00:48:20,640 --> 00:48:26,160
So it could be a little, you can feel a little lost at, and I would sort of resented that

1184
00:48:26,160 --> 00:48:28,240
like, well, it's so easy at my church.

1185
00:48:28,240 --> 00:48:29,440
You just kind of hang.

1186
00:48:29,440 --> 00:48:31,840
But Sydney pointed out to me and it's a very good point.

1187
00:48:31,840 --> 00:48:36,480
At our church, there was a moment where if you stood up at the wrong time, your whole

1188
00:48:36,480 --> 00:48:37,280
life is over.

1189
00:48:37,280 --> 00:48:41,840
There's a moment where if you stood up at the wrong time, you have to like rededicate

1190
00:48:41,840 --> 00:48:44,480
your life to Jesus or join the church or something.

1191
00:48:44,480 --> 00:48:48,080
Not only that, my favorite thing about the invitational is when sometimes you didn't

1192
00:48:48,080 --> 00:48:50,240
get a response from anyone.

1193
00:48:50,240 --> 00:48:52,000
So they would just kind of keep the music going.

1194
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:53,360
Keep it going, keep it going, keep going.

1195
00:48:53,360 --> 00:48:53,920
And then like.

1196
00:48:53,920 --> 00:48:56,000
I feel like there's someone out there who's ready to commit.

1197
00:48:56,720 --> 00:49:03,280
What's always great is there would always be a guy, especially if like, when you had

1198
00:49:03,280 --> 00:49:11,040
more like Pentecostal type people, you know, more of that like very enthusiastic.

1199
00:49:11,040 --> 00:49:12,480
Snake eaters.

1200
00:49:12,480 --> 00:49:13,120
Snake eaters.

1201
00:49:13,120 --> 00:49:14,720
No, there's a word I'm looking for.

1202
00:49:15,840 --> 00:49:17,360
Not enthusiastic, but.

1203
00:49:17,360 --> 00:49:17,920
Ecclesiastic.

1204
00:49:17,920 --> 00:49:19,440
Anyway, ecclesiastic.

1205
00:49:19,440 --> 00:49:20,000
I don't know.

1206
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:25,120
But you would have people who would stretch it out like youth camps and stuff, and they

1207
00:49:25,120 --> 00:49:30,720
would always say something like, listen, I know that this has been going on for a while,

1208
00:49:30,720 --> 00:49:34,320
but I just feel the Holy Spirit is telling me that somebody.

1209
00:49:34,320 --> 00:49:34,880
Write it out.

1210
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:38,640
Somebody else needs to come up here and get right with the Lord.

1211
00:49:38,640 --> 00:49:41,280
Like the Spirit's telling me that.

1212
00:49:41,280 --> 00:49:44,480
And then inevitably, no one else would come up.

1213
00:49:44,480 --> 00:49:49,120
And which begs the question for me and began sowing some rather unpleasant seeds of doubt.

1214
00:49:49,680 --> 00:49:52,720
So was the Holy Spirit just like, ah, my bad.

1215
00:49:52,720 --> 00:49:54,880
I'm telling you, it's like Travis at a casino.

1216
00:49:54,880 --> 00:49:56,880
Like, no, no, no, no, no, I got this.

1217
00:49:57,440 --> 00:49:58,400
Here come the turn.

1218
00:49:58,400 --> 00:50:01,680
All right, all right, all right, all right.

1219
00:50:01,680 --> 00:50:08,320
That was the best, the dismount from that stance of like, well, all right then.

1220
00:50:08,320 --> 00:50:09,280
See y'all next Sunday.

1221
00:50:09,280 --> 00:50:10,720
Oh, have a safe drive home.

1222
00:50:11,600 --> 00:50:12,000
Okay.

1223
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:12,640
All right, cool.

1224
00:50:12,640 --> 00:50:14,080
Anyway, do all that during the wedding.

1225
00:50:14,080 --> 00:50:14,640
Gonna be a hit.

1226
00:50:15,360 --> 00:50:16,880
Gonna be a great wedding.

1227
00:50:18,560 --> 00:50:19,680
We're gonna hit like a record.

1228
00:50:19,680 --> 00:50:24,240
We're actually gonna go through all of our questions on our questions list for this episode.

1229
00:50:24,240 --> 00:50:28,160
People can't get mad at us anymore about not doing enough questions because we're doing

1230
00:50:28,160 --> 00:50:28,800
more questions.

1231
00:50:29,360 --> 00:50:29,920
So go sign up.

1232
00:50:29,920 --> 00:50:31,200
So keep it in your face.

1233
00:50:32,080 --> 00:50:34,320
I have difficulty talking about my feelings.

1234
00:50:34,880 --> 00:50:39,520
My girlfriend is not happy about this, particularly in that sometimes she's angry about it.

1235
00:50:39,520 --> 00:50:40,960
And I don't blame her.

1236
00:50:40,960 --> 00:50:44,800
One of my big hangups is trying to explain my feelings with accuracy and exactness.

1237
00:50:44,800 --> 00:50:48,720
And with feelings being what they are, I end up at a loss for words.

1238
00:50:48,720 --> 00:50:51,040
Brothers, how do I do a better job of expressing how I feel?

1239
00:50:51,040 --> 00:50:52,000
That's from Gmail.

1240
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:52,720
Flashcards.

1241
00:50:53,600 --> 00:50:57,280
Boy, three former Baptists, you have come to the right place.

1242
00:50:57,280 --> 00:51:02,240
See, you say that, but I have no problem expressing my feelings at any given time at the drop

1243
00:51:02,240 --> 00:51:02,640
of a hat.

1244
00:51:02,640 --> 00:51:03,600
I'll just do it.

1245
00:51:03,600 --> 00:51:04,720
Because for me, it's entirely physiological.

1246
00:51:04,720 --> 00:51:07,200
I mean, I cry often and freely.

1247
00:51:07,200 --> 00:51:08,640
Yeah, but I mean, that's a disorder.

1248
00:51:08,640 --> 00:51:12,560
That's not really an expression of your feelings because you could be crying and be like pretty

1249
00:51:12,560 --> 00:51:13,360
psyched.

1250
00:51:13,360 --> 00:51:15,680
Yeah, I have what the doctors call full eyes.

1251
00:51:17,840 --> 00:51:23,600
My problem a lot of times, and I've only learned this as I've gotten older, is that a lot of

1252
00:51:23,600 --> 00:51:24,880
times I don't know how I feel.

1253
00:51:24,880 --> 00:51:31,600
Like I don't, until I talk about it and like say the wrong thing several times, like trying

1254
00:51:31,600 --> 00:51:33,280
to get, it's like a mystery.

1255
00:51:33,280 --> 00:51:40,400
I'll be, I'll know something's up, but I won't know what it is that I'm feeling.

1256
00:51:40,400 --> 00:51:42,000
I'm not in touch with those feelings.

1257
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:46,240
And that could be part of your problem that you're just not, unless you're talking about

1258
00:51:46,240 --> 00:51:48,880
it with somebody and like trying to work through it.

1259
00:51:48,880 --> 00:51:52,240
A lot of times I don't know exactly what I'm feeling.

1260
00:51:52,240 --> 00:51:56,160
For the longest time, whenever like people talked about having trouble expressing their

1261
00:51:56,160 --> 00:52:01,600
emotions, I really thought that what they were saying was like, they would feel sadness

1262
00:52:01,600 --> 00:52:03,120
and then somebody like, hey, are you okay?

1263
00:52:03,120 --> 00:52:04,160
And they would just go, yep.

1264
00:52:05,360 --> 00:52:09,760
And now I'm starting to suspect that really what's going on is like, because you're so,

1265
00:52:10,400 --> 00:52:12,560
I don't know if it's caught up in it or denying it.

1266
00:52:12,560 --> 00:52:18,400
Like you don't realize a lot of like, since I've been with Teresa, I've gotten better

1267
00:52:18,400 --> 00:52:23,440
at expressing emotions because instead of just like swallowing down or not acknowledging

1268
00:52:23,440 --> 00:52:27,600
it, like as we'll talk about it, I'll say out loud, like, I want you to know that I

1269
00:52:27,600 --> 00:52:28,880
am feeling angry right now.

1270
00:52:28,880 --> 00:52:34,240
And this is why, you know, so I don't think it has to be emotional in your sharing of

1271
00:52:34,240 --> 00:52:34,800
your emotions.

1272
00:52:34,800 --> 00:52:38,800
Sometimes it's just being honest and just saying like right now in this moment, I am

1273
00:52:38,800 --> 00:52:42,480
annoyed because of this or like, Hey, I just want you to know I'm really enjoying this

1274
00:52:42,480 --> 00:52:43,760
moment, you know?

1275
00:52:43,760 --> 00:52:45,200
And oh yeah.

1276
00:52:45,200 --> 00:52:46,160
Say it like that too.

1277
00:52:46,160 --> 00:52:48,480
That's good because I'll give her that not quite human vibe.

1278
00:52:49,200 --> 00:52:53,840
I'm just saying as a start, like you don't want to like jump in feet first into like

1279
00:52:53,840 --> 00:52:54,800
sad town.

1280
00:52:54,800 --> 00:52:57,840
And no, I'm just, I, for me, it's not that easy.

1281
00:52:57,840 --> 00:53:01,520
Like I don't like a lot of times I don't know.

1282
00:53:01,520 --> 00:53:03,600
Like I'll be short with somebody, right?

1283
00:53:03,600 --> 00:53:08,720
Or I'll be, I know I'm not having as much pleasure as I normally do.

1284
00:53:08,720 --> 00:53:10,000
And I don't know why.

1285
00:53:10,560 --> 00:53:15,120
And for me, that can be hard because I don't want to say I'll end up saying stuff that

1286
00:53:15,120 --> 00:53:18,880
I don't actually feel just like trying to get to something that feels.

1287
00:53:18,880 --> 00:53:19,760
I want pleasure.

1288
00:53:20,720 --> 00:53:21,280
Pleasure.

1289
00:53:21,280 --> 00:53:22,080
I need pleasure.

1290
00:53:22,080 --> 00:53:22,880
Pleasure.

1291
00:53:23,440 --> 00:53:24,160
Pleasure.

1292
00:53:25,520 --> 00:53:31,600
You know, but I don't think I, all I'm saying is that in any kind of communication that

1293
00:53:31,600 --> 00:53:37,520
you are inexperienced with, you got to start off, you know, small and practice it.

1294
00:53:37,520 --> 00:53:42,000
You don't want to just like jump into being the dude who is constantly like.

1295
00:53:42,720 --> 00:53:43,040
Crying.

1296
00:53:43,040 --> 00:53:44,800
Got to work out to having full eyes.

1297
00:53:44,800 --> 00:53:46,880
You can't just cry all the time or it's weird.

1298
00:53:46,880 --> 00:53:51,200
You got to work up to it until everyone just accepts that you're that dude who's moved

1299
00:53:51,200 --> 00:53:54,000
by particularly strong episodes of Family Matters.

1300
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:57,760
The other, the other thing is you got to be careful about when you're, if you're not

1301
00:53:57,760 --> 00:54:05,200
sure like what your feelings are, you got to be careful to figure that stuff out before

1302
00:54:05,200 --> 00:54:11,040
you start talking about, start talking to the person who may have created those feelings.

1303
00:54:11,040 --> 00:54:15,840
Like if I try to work through my feelings with my wife, she knows that I'm a dummy and

1304
00:54:15,840 --> 00:54:22,160
she'll try to covertly, subliminally slip in when I might be upset about like, I don't

1305
00:54:22,160 --> 00:54:24,880
know, sweetheart, you've been really frustrated.

1306
00:54:24,880 --> 00:54:28,960
Maybe you're angry at yourself for never closing the cabinets ever.

1307
00:54:28,960 --> 00:54:32,560
And maybe you should do that from time to time and just see how that goes.

1308
00:54:32,560 --> 00:54:33,120
So that's.

1309
00:54:33,120 --> 00:54:35,840
How much of your anger is cabinet based?

1310
00:54:35,840 --> 00:54:41,440
How much of your anger is centered on cabinets and leaving them open all the time and never

1311
00:54:41,440 --> 00:54:42,400
closing them?

1312
00:54:42,400 --> 00:54:43,360
Do you guys ever do that?

1313
00:54:43,360 --> 00:54:44,240
Cause I do it.

1314
00:54:44,240 --> 00:54:45,120
No, I'm an adult.

1315
00:54:45,840 --> 00:54:46,880
Yeah, I'm supposed to be an adult.

1316
00:54:46,880 --> 00:54:47,040
Yeah.

1317
00:54:47,040 --> 00:54:50,000
I don't like it when like bugs get on my place cause I eat on those.

1318
00:54:52,160 --> 00:54:56,320
I mostly, I just take a lot of naps.

1319
00:55:00,320 --> 00:55:03,200
Naps are like train stops for your emotions.

1320
00:55:03,200 --> 00:55:04,720
They need time to get on and off.

1321
00:55:04,720 --> 00:55:11,920
When it gets a little bit too real, a little bit too hyphy in my life, my lifey, I'll just

1322
00:55:11,920 --> 00:55:13,600
take a quicker, quick nap-a-roo.

1323
00:55:14,800 --> 00:55:16,080
Cause like, you know what?

1324
00:55:16,080 --> 00:55:22,480
It worked when I was four and I'm 26 now and it still works pretty goddamn well.

1325
00:55:22,480 --> 00:55:26,160
And I wake up and my wife is like, how are you doing?

1326
00:55:26,160 --> 00:55:27,440
And the answer is always great.

1327
00:55:28,880 --> 00:55:29,120
I guess.

1328
00:55:29,120 --> 00:55:31,920
You know, my wife has just taught me, I had no idea.

1329
00:55:31,920 --> 00:55:34,960
Like so much of my emotions are hunger based.

1330
00:55:36,400 --> 00:55:37,440
Like I had no idea.

1331
00:55:37,440 --> 00:55:40,800
Like we, I think we were, when we were in Louisville, like we stopped for lunch.

1332
00:55:40,800 --> 00:55:43,600
It was like a really late lunch at like three o'clock and I'm eating a sandwich.

1333
00:55:43,600 --> 00:55:45,200
She was like, do you feel better?

1334
00:55:45,200 --> 00:55:45,840
I was like, yeah.

1335
00:55:45,840 --> 00:55:46,240
What?

1336
00:55:46,240 --> 00:55:47,120
Wait, why?

1337
00:55:47,120 --> 00:55:49,440
She's like, well, you've just been kind of frustrated for the last two hours.

1338
00:55:49,440 --> 00:55:51,760
I was like, oh no, that's just cause we couldn't find the place.

1339
00:55:51,760 --> 00:55:53,280
She's like, no, it's cause you're hungry.

1340
00:55:53,280 --> 00:55:54,240
It's like, oh, you're right.

1341
00:55:54,240 --> 00:55:54,800
You got me.

1342
00:55:54,800 --> 00:55:55,840
Just needed sandwich.

1343
00:55:57,360 --> 00:55:59,200
We needed a dose of vitamin sandwich.

1344
00:55:59,200 --> 00:56:02,560
We are a bunch of fucking eat beasts.

1345
00:56:03,360 --> 00:56:04,000
Yeah.

1346
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:05,600
We're a bunch of monsters.

1347
00:56:05,600 --> 00:56:10,320
I don't have like, I really do think I don't have that many complex emotions.

1348
00:56:11,440 --> 00:56:15,920
I don't want to sound like I'm like a free spirit or whatever over here, but like,

1349
00:56:17,120 --> 00:56:21,360
I never feel like I have emotions that are too complex to describe.

1350
00:56:21,360 --> 00:56:24,160
It usually really is like, how are you Griffin?

1351
00:56:24,160 --> 00:56:24,560
I don't know.

1352
00:56:24,560 --> 00:56:25,120
Kind of bored.

1353
00:56:25,760 --> 00:56:28,800
Like, I'm not joking.

1354
00:56:28,800 --> 00:56:32,080
Like, I'm not like, I just been thinking about death a lot lately.

1355
00:56:32,080 --> 00:56:34,400
It's really mostly like, I don't know.

1356
00:56:34,400 --> 00:56:36,960
The cat woke me up last night, so I'm a little bit sleepy.

1357
00:56:36,960 --> 00:56:38,480
Well, that could be the problem Griffin.

1358
00:56:39,120 --> 00:56:40,640
I think about death a lot.

1359
00:56:40,640 --> 00:56:41,760
You should think about death instead.

1360
00:56:41,760 --> 00:56:42,000
Okay.

1361
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:43,680
Well, hold on, hold on, hold on.

1362
00:56:43,680 --> 00:56:44,400
Let me give it a shot.

1363
00:56:46,960 --> 00:56:47,920
Oh my God.

1364
00:56:48,960 --> 00:56:52,560
Oh no, it's all going to stop one day.

1365
00:56:53,360 --> 00:56:55,440
It's all just going to stop one day.

1366
00:56:55,440 --> 00:56:59,040
Oh no, no, no, no.

1367
00:57:00,640 --> 00:57:02,000
That's what your 30s are like.

1368
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:03,680
I'm not going to be here one day.

1369
00:57:03,680 --> 00:57:05,040
It's just going to stop.

1370
00:57:08,480 --> 00:57:09,280
I need a nap.

1371
00:57:09,280 --> 00:57:12,800
That could be a good thing to do during a wedding ceremony.

1372
00:57:14,240 --> 00:57:16,480
You too, I've known you your whole lives.

1373
00:57:16,480 --> 00:57:17,840
You're so perfect for each other.

1374
00:57:17,840 --> 00:57:20,400
It's all going to stop one day.

1375
00:57:20,400 --> 00:57:22,640
No, no, no.

1376
00:57:23,440 --> 00:57:24,800
Griffin, you're joking.

1377
00:57:24,800 --> 00:57:30,240
Do you know how many times I've had that exact, like, mid episode?

1378
00:57:31,760 --> 00:57:34,480
We talk about like ghost horses and shit.

1379
00:57:34,480 --> 00:57:38,880
I'm like, yeah, and another thing about, oh God, it won't stop.

1380
00:57:38,880 --> 00:57:42,000
I actually had that conversation with someone last night.

1381
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:43,280
It's all going to stop.

1382
00:57:43,280 --> 00:57:44,960
Think about it.

1383
00:57:44,960 --> 00:57:46,800
Cake boss, right guys?

1384
00:57:46,800 --> 00:57:48,720
Goofs and goofs and goofs and goofs.

1385
00:57:49,920 --> 00:57:51,760
We're the ones that distract you from death.

1386
00:57:51,760 --> 00:57:53,280
Who is to distract us?

1387
00:57:53,280 --> 00:57:55,200
No one.

1388
00:57:57,280 --> 00:57:58,880
Yeah, well, that's all the distractions.

1389
00:57:58,880 --> 00:57:59,440
Let's shut it down.

1390
00:57:59,440 --> 00:58:00,720
I'm going to see the Lego movie.

1391
00:58:00,720 --> 00:58:03,600
It's going to wash the fucking taste of this episode right out my mouth.

1392
00:58:04,720 --> 00:58:07,040
That's all the distraction you get for this week.

1393
00:58:08,240 --> 00:58:09,920
You can start the episode over again.

1394
00:58:09,920 --> 00:58:13,760
Just stave off the darkness for a bit longer.

1395
00:58:14,480 --> 00:58:16,480
Thank you to everybody tweeting about the show.

Thank you for tweeting about our program.

1406
00:58:55,040 --> 00:58:55,920
I don't know how I feel.

1407
00:58:56,640 --> 00:58:59,440
I don't know how I feel about the jam too.

1408
00:58:59,440 --> 00:59:00,960
The jam revisited.

1409
00:59:00,960 --> 00:59:01,840
You feel very good about it.

1410
00:59:01,840 --> 00:59:02,320
I feel great.

1411
00:59:02,320 --> 00:59:02,720
That's right.

1412
00:59:02,720 --> 00:59:04,480
I just couldn't find the right words for it.

1413
00:59:04,480 --> 00:59:07,440
I want to thank John Roderick and The Long Winters for the use of our theme song.

1414
00:59:07,440 --> 00:59:10,640
It's a departure off the album Putting the Days to Bed.

1415
00:59:10,640 --> 00:59:11,920
It's great.

1416
00:59:11,920 --> 00:59:12,880
All their albums are great.

1417
00:59:12,880 --> 00:59:13,600

Thank you, John, and The Long Winters.

1421
00:59:19,680 --> 00:59:21,440
And I want to say thanks again to LegalZoom.

1422
00:59:22,880 --> 00:59:23,680
Think about death.

1423
00:59:24,720 --> 00:59:26,800
You go to LegalZoom, make yourself a will.

And we'll mention you on the show.

1430
00:59:44,800 --> 00:59:46,320
That's a terrible idea.

1431
00:59:46,320 --> 00:59:49,600
I wonder if, like, LegalZoom listens to these episodes and goes,

1432
00:59:49,600 --> 00:59:52,240
man, they really just kind of focus on that death aspect a lot.

1433
00:59:52,240 --> 00:59:54,880
Yeah, they really hit that death note real hard.

1434
00:59:57,040 --> 00:59:58,320

And they just announced Max, the boatparty.biz 2014.

When are we going to produce that bonus shit, guys?

1449
01:00:42,640 --> 01:00:43,680
Let's figure that out later.

1450
01:00:43,680 --> 01:00:45,600
All right, you guys want a final Yahoo?

1451
01:00:46,160 --> 01:00:46,880

1452
01:00:46,880 --> 01:00:50,160

01:01:06,080 --> 01:01:08,240
Can I get a fucking word in edgewise?

1460
01:01:11,200 --> 01:01:13,840
I'm Griffin McElroy, and this has been My Brother, My Brother,
