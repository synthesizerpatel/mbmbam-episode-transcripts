1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:30,800
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:49,920
Hello everybody, and welcome to My Brother, My Brother, and Me, an advice show for the

6
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:56,320
modern era. I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy. I'm your middlest brother, Travis McElroy.

7
00:00:56,320 --> 00:01:04,080
It's like, anytime he talks different from how he normally talks, it's like I can feel my Jeep I'm

8
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:12,080
driving rolling backwards into bit country. But this is Griffin McElroy. Hey Trav, what seems-

9
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:14,880
The back tires are just spinning, Griff, we gotta get the hell out of here!

10
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:16,160
What's the matter, Travy?

11
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:20,400
I mean, it's not really a bit, I just, can I be-

12
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:24,240
That always means it's a bit! All day I'm Griffin, you gotta give a little more gas,

13
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:28,240
partner, come on! Well, it's just, you know, it's a difficult time of year,

14
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:33,920
and you know, there's a lot of emotions at play, and can I talk to you guys about something kind of

15
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:36,960
real honest? Something real? Something real?

16
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:43,440
Griffin, I warn you, he is using the faux sincere tone. This is always a recipe for disaster.

17
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:45,440
We gotta get out of here, find those keys!

18
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:48,800
I just, I forgot to put the damn snow tires on, but yeah-

19
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:49,680
Damn, we're trapped!

20
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:50,560
All right, Trav-

21
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:52,240
Quick, just acknowledge what he said, Griffin!

22
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:56,480
All right, Trav, tell us on our comedy podcast what's really making you very sad right now.

23
00:01:56,480 --> 00:02:02,640
Do you guys think, and I just, I really appreciate you guys letting me be vulnerable like this,

24
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:09,760
do you guys think that in the end, the Bumble and Yukon Cornelius end up together?

25
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:13,280
Now that's something to talk about, isn't it?

26
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:17,040
That's something worth ta- Now that's something worth talking about.

27
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:19,520
I don't know why that would make our brothers so sad.

28
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:23,920
Well, because I'm just worried that they don't, that they don't end up together and that

29
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:26,400
they just don't find love in a hopeless place.

30
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:31,680
I'm in a hopeless place right now, pretty far from love and the light of the Lord,

31
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:34,880
but I don't know that they end up together, Travis.

32
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:40,160
Because I'll be honest, I don't think those two are attracted to each other sexually or romantically.

33
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:45,200
You don't get a whiff of that when he says Bumble's bounce, that that's like a-

34
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:46,400
On his, on his-

35
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:51,200
Well, but I think that's more just like, they can get it, like Bumble's can get it.

36
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:52,800
Bumble's can bounce, you know what I mean?

37
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:53,600
Oh, I see.

38
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:54,560
That slang you've invented.

39
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:55,760
I know, I like that.

40
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:59,600
So I can, if, if I was talking about, if I was talking about Travis, I could just say,

41
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:03,200
Travis, bounce, and you know what I, you know what that means.

42
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:04,000
It would be inappropriate.

43
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:04,720
Yeah, like I can get it.

44
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:05,440
Right.

45
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:10,560
Well, because I think it's obvious that Rudolph ends up with Clarice and that Hermey ends up with

46
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:13,760
this former boss, the dude with the weird pointy goatee.

47
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:15,520
Not sure I like that, but keep going.

48
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:17,680
Oh, the, oh, are you kidding me?

49
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:18,960
Their chemistry is obvious.

50
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:20,240
That's a no brainer.

51
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:26,240
And I feel like at the end, there's definitely a palpable attraction betwixt the Bumble and

52
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:27,520
Yukon Cornelius.

53
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:31,280
I'm just worried that societal norms might keep them apart.

54
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:38,400
I think physical norms are really the, the big complicating factor here, just the size

55
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:40,080
of, the size of the venture.

56
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:48,240
I don't want to yuck Cornelius's yums, but I also don't want the Bumble to crush his

57
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:49,760
bones by trying to bounce.

58
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:51,200
Oh, the Bumble's a bottom.

59
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:56,080
Okay, now this is something we can sink our teeth into.

60
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:58,320
Yeah, I think Yukon would top the hell out of him.

61
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:01,600
Okay, okay, cause he's got like the climbing gear.

62
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:04,720
Now that makes a lot of sense actually, now that you put it that way.

63
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:08,720
And also he would definitely be like the daddy in this scenario.

64
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:13,600
I feel like just Yukon Cornelius has a lot of like, just a lot of power energy.

65
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:14,960
He would be a power top.

66
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:16,080
I don't know if that's a thing.

67
00:04:16,960 --> 00:04:23,120
Yeah, no, I think we all thought that when we first saw this ancient animated movie,

68
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:32,320
that we saw this prospector, this silly gold obsessed sort of folk legend figure and saw

69
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:34,160
him and said, I bet he could bounce a butt.

70
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:38,400
Yeah, I bet he could bounce a butt.

71
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:41,440
Left, right, and ever so rightly.

72
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:42,400
You know what I mean?

73
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:45,840
Now here's the question though, because I don't want this to skew just into the physical,

74
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:48,880
because I mean, they definitely fuck.

75
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:50,160
That's not what I'm worried about.

76
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:52,480
I'm worried about if they end up together.

77
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:55,600
Do they form a lasting romantic relationship?

78
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:57,360
I don't think so, man.

79
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:58,640
Tiger can't change the stripes.

80
00:04:58,640 --> 00:05:01,280
Like he can love Bumble, right?

81
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:07,760
Yeah, and he does, but you know what's going to be, I know Bumble is his third priority.

82
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:12,000
And I know what the first two are, and I'll give you a hint, is silver and gold.

83
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,920
Yeah, that's going to be the real problem with the relationship.

84
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:19,040
He's going to have to get out there during silver and gold season.

85
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:24,720
The time away, the Bumble can't just sit in the cave and wait for Cornelius to come back

86
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:30,400
if Cornelius comes back and doesn't fall into some sort of ice chasm.

87
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:32,800
Because there's precedent for that.

88
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:36,560
Can you imagine the Bumble being up all night on its little widow's perch

89
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:41,200
waiting for their sea captain to return from the glaciers?

90
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:42,080
No way, man.

91
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:47,120
Now, could the Bumble go with Yukon Cornelius on these adventures?

92
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:48,800
Oh, they tried it, didn't they?

93
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:53,520
I mean, they tried it, but honestly, it's not the Bumble's passion.

94
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:56,320
He doesn't love it the way that Yukon Cornelius does.

95
00:05:56,320 --> 00:06:04,240
I will say, I'm willing to accept that they don't stay together if they really gave it a shot.

96
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:09,680
I mean, if they really tried to make it work and they communicated with one another

97
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:14,640
and they put the time in and they just found that their priorities were different

98
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:16,880
and they grew apart as people, I'm totally fine with that.

99
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:21,200
Now, let me float this as long as we're having fun here in this safe place

100
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:25,200
where we're just getting out there and just shooting out some silly string.

101
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:32,960
That was an unfortunate way of saying that, but what if Cornelius ends up with Frosty,

102
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:38,000
the snowman, and then it turns into less of a sexual Randy Romp,

103
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:44,000
like the one that Travis is floating, a sort of American Pie 4, Santa's Wonderland,

104
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:50,240
and instead becomes more of a coming of age, like me, Earl, and the dying girl,

105
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:54,320
but the dying girl is a snowman who comes spring, but they're very much in love

106
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:57,200
and so you get a walk to remember vibes and people love that.

107
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:00,560
Yeah, here's the twist though, Griffin.

108
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:05,040
I think maybe they entered into the relationship and Yukon Cornelius is like,

109
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:13,040
we only have these winter months, but then time passes and it's not getting any warmer

110
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:17,920
and Frosty's like, well, we live, this is the North Pole, it's gonna be fine.

111
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:20,320
And suddenly Yukon Cornelius is like, oh.

112
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:23,120
Oh shit, I got a dip, yeah.

113
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:27,760
I don't know that I, now that the timeline shifted, I don't know.

114
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:31,120
I think maybe we were in this for like different things.

115
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:31,840
Yeah.

116
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:33,760
And I got a bounce.

117
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:36,880
I'm gonna hit you guys with something that is,

118
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:40,160
you're gonna, the first thing you're gonna do is laugh, but then you're gonna be like, huh?

119
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:43,680
But do feel free to laugh and bust up.

120
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:45,280
Okay, okay.

121
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:46,560
But don't skip to the huh.

122
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:56,400
Huh, if Yukon Cornelius and the Bumble found a way to conceive a child, it would be Wolverine.

123
00:07:58,560 --> 00:07:59,440
Walk me through that.

124
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:00,640
Think about it.

125
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:01,120
No.

126
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:02,800
He Canadian?

127
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:03,840
Uh-huh, obviously.

128
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:06,640
Outdoors person, beard, hairiness.

129
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:06,960
Yeah.

130
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:07,920
Claws and fangs.

131
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:09,040
Metal bones?

132
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:09,680
You know what I mean?

133
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:12,080
Metal bones?

134
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:13,440
Well, he's got the ice pick, doesn't he?

135
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:15,360
Yeah, it says silver and gold right there.

136
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:15,680
Okay.

137
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:17,600
Yep, metal in the baby's bones.

138
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:25,520
Put metal in my baby's bones, paid for the whole surgery.

139
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:34,080
Put metal in the bones of my baby so he can be a hero for me.

140
00:08:35,920 --> 00:08:40,160
So, wow, oh my God, I just looked at the, we've been doing this for eight minutes?

141
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:42,720
Are you kidding me?

142
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:44,160
Doesn't seem right.

143
00:08:44,160 --> 00:08:46,800
It feels like two and a half, but eight, I guess.

144
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:47,520
All right.

145
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:48,320
Flew by.

146
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:49,120
Cool, it's going to be-

147
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:50,400
Griffin, did you say it flew by?

148
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:51,440
It flew right by.

149
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:57,040
I think I could talk, we haven't even gotten to the fact that Herme rips all the teeth out

150
00:08:57,040 --> 00:09:01,040
of the Bumble's mouth, and the Bumble's kind of cool with it, isn't he?

151
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:04,000
Yeah, well, he's into dental stuff.

152
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:08,000
All right, it's getting bleak, so what's next?

153
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:11,920
Oh, this is an advice show, obviously.

154
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:16,880
And so I thought we could do, on this one, a little advice for our listeners.

155
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:17,440
Are you sure?

156
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:21,360
Because I got some fan theories about Christmas Carol, too, if we want to get into those.

157
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:21,840
Kickass idea.

158
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:23,440
Kickass audience.

159
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:26,800
There has to be a portion of our audience, just the way the world works, that has not

160
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:31,840
seen Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer in the past eight minutes, must have been absolutely delirious.

161
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:32,240
Yeah.

162
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:33,920
Must have been quite a trip.

163
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:38,400
I'm betting that those people probably enjoyed it more than the other ones, though.

164
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:40,800
How is that possible, though?

165
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:43,440
They're going to get sent to the hospital from Olin.

166
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:51,920
The last time I was at an airport, there was a caricature artist doing free portraits.

167
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:54,080
I've always wanted one, so I figured, why not?

168
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:54,960
I got time to kill.

169
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:56,240
That's actually a really good time.

170
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:57,840
Oh, yeah.

171
00:09:57,840 --> 00:09:59,200
That would be the moment, right?

172
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:02,160
If they're on a boardwalk at the beach, no thanks.

173
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:04,000
I'm having a great time with my family.

174
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:09,680
But here, alone, in the Charlotte airport, as I wait for a flight, yeah, I'd love that,

175
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:12,320
actually. I'd like to take a moment to be considered.

176
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:15,040
I do want to say real quick, and I do want to hear the rest of the question, but

177
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:20,560
if I saw a caricature artist, I would be like, I don't know that I want to pay for that.

178
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:22,080
And then they'd be like, it's free.

179
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:24,560
And I'd be like, well, no, I definitely don't want it.

180
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:27,440
There's something about it being free that seems weird to me.

181
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:30,480
If it's good, then you should charge for it.

182
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:31,600
What is he charging for?

183
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:32,400
How is your business model?

184
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:33,120
You think it's a frame?

185
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:39,120
He's like, if you want to have it, then you have to pay for it.

186
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:44,720
The only other explanation is that the airport has paid the caricature artist to be there

187
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:47,360
as an amenity.

188
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:52,640
Or the caricature artist draws you with a grody butt, and your wiener is out.

189
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:54,400
And you're like, what did you do that for?

190
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:58,480
And they're like, if you want me to erase it, I got the eraser right here.

191
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:01,440
But that's 50 bucks for this No PP DLC.

192
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:06,880
He draws you with photorealism in a compromising position with the mayor's wife.

193
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:13,280
And you don't give me $1,000 and this is going to find its way into the Inside Edition Studios.

194
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:16,240
Inside Edition Studios is going to go for that, you think?

195
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:17,360
Yeah.

196
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:19,520
They're pretty desperate at this point.

197
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:21,440
They will take a charcoal drawing.

198
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:24,400
They're willing to go outside the edition at this point.

199
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:28,880
They're just looking for anything that will draw the people inside the edition.

200
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:31,200
Okay, there's more to say about this wonderful scenario.

201
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:38,880
You know, about halfway through, he mentioned that I was the first person to stare at him

202
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:39,440
while he worked.

203
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:46,000
And I immediately felt super awkward and suddenly didn't know where to look or how to act.

204
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:52,000
If I ever see another caricature artist, what's the proper etiquette?

205
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:55,200
Should I just avoid them all together as some cartoon buffoon?

206
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:56,080
You can't avoid them.

207
00:11:56,080 --> 00:12:01,120
Well, I've actually done a pretty good job of it my entire life.

208
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:06,960
That is not true because I know for a fact that we've been to amusement parks together

209
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:08,480
where they wait around every corner.

210
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:13,520
You turn a corner thinking, oh, this might be like a fun vendor that sells perhaps some

211
00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:14,480
kind of kettle corn.

212
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:19,600
Oh no, it's a caricature artist who has done a Danny Zuko.

213
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:24,000
Right, but if he tries to get up, if he rolls up on me, I give him a little chin music and

214
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,600
I just keep on trucking.

215
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:31,360
You got to, or I'll say we'll pin you to the ground and draw you in a crazy way that I

216
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:32,560
don't appreciate.

217
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:35,440
So sometimes you got to give him a little buff, buffo, buff.

218
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:44,000
I would say, dear listener, that you have found apparently one of the very, very few

219
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,720
ways there is to genuinely screw up this interaction.

220
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:52,720
And I would not trust you, you being who you are with your track record, I would not trust

221
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:54,240
you with another caricature artist.

222
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:58,400
I don't think they, it's a small community, first off, you know what I mean?

223
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:00,560
Small community, they talk.

224
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:01,360
Yeah, they've talked.

225
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:01,760
They know.

226
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:02,320
They talked.

227
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:03,040
They know about you.

228
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:04,640
They got an eye out for you.

229
00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:16,000
Why on fuck would your choice be to stare dead eye, just stare down this person doing

230
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:16,960
a caricature of you?

231
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:18,480
Oh, I'm sorry, Justin.

232
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:23,520
A little thing called the Mona Lisa, like a piece of art where you're looking dead at

233
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:24,560
the artist, like.

234
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:27,360
No, no, no, no, no.

235
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:31,760
There is every portrait like that where it's like staring out at the viewer.

236
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:34,480
They have you look at the last second.

237
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:36,960
It's like five minutes before they're done.

238
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:38,080
They're like, okay, go ahead.

239
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:40,320
And go ahead and look at me, Mona.

240
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:41,120
Thank you.

241
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:41,600
Thank you.

242
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:44,080
Okay, okay, okay, look away, look away, look away.

243
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:49,360
I'm just, I, okay, it's not what I would do.

244
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:54,800
Yeah, but I can see where you're looking in the direction of the person rather than

245
00:13:54,800 --> 00:14:01,200
pretending they're not there could arguably seem like the least awkward.

246
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:06,800
Now, I will say from a different point of view, why, what do you think was going through

247
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:13,520
the caricature artist's head that they felt the need to say you're the first person to

248
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:15,760
ever stare at me while I do this?

249
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:18,400
Yeah, and maybe it's their like sixth one ever.

250
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:21,440
Like no one actually takes me up on this.

251
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:23,040
That's why I'm doing it for free.

252
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:24,400
I'm still learning.

253
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:27,120
Yeah, this is a, I'm in my residence.

254
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:29,040
I'm actually not a caricature artist.

255
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:33,040
I'm just waiting for a flight and I had a pad and I was bored.

256
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:41,120
If I was getting my portrait done by a caricature artist, I would be too preoccupied with which

257
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:46,160
of my zany features are they gonna pop off, you know what I mean?

258
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:53,040
I assume it's my massive pecs or maybe my delts or these glutes.

259
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:54,480
It's never a good one.

260
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:59,440
No one's ever looked at a caricature of themselves and been like, yeah, actually.

261
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:03,280
Yeah, actually, hello new Bumble profile picture.

262
00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:04,880
It's not anything good ever.

263
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:09,680
It's like, you know, here's my Austin Powers teeth that have been made big like a donkey's

264
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:10,400
teeth.

265
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:10,960
You know what I mean?

266
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:13,440
Even like a Hirschfeld like looks wild.

267
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:14,720
It's like a wild.

268
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:16,080
What do you think your guys would be?

269
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:23,600
Because I think in a good outcome, I've got a big pomp of purple hair on top of my head.

270
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:29,280
But realistically, it's that I have a giant head is probably what the thing is.

271
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:32,640
But that's a lot of caricatures, right?

272
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:35,120
Big head seems to be a pretty common one.

273
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:43,440
I don't, I just, you don't have to do, they don't, they can't make you let them draw you.

274
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:44,720
There is nowhere to look.

275
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:47,680
I'm I've been thinking about it for six minutes now.

276
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:49,760
There's nowhere to look except at your phone.

277
00:15:50,640 --> 00:15:53,440
I don't really think I don't really think they need to take you.

278
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:57,920
I don't think they need to drink you in for the art necessarily.

279
00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:02,880
I think they just need to spot your one flaw and then make it a big cartoon that makes

280
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:05,520
you look like just a real idiot.

281
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:11,920
Hey, I can't stop thinking about the fact that this person has gone through extensive

282
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:17,840
security background checks to sit in the middle of this airport to do caricatures.

283
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:21,920
Yeah, what's, oh, actually this email is from 1998.

284
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:27,440
So back when you could just walk through and have a fun, have a fun time.

285
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:31,120
You could just say, I'm picking someone up from the airport.

286
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:34,640
My favorite restaurant used to be the airport Chili's.

287
00:16:34,640 --> 00:16:39,840
But then, you know, then, you know, and then I couldn't go anymore.

288
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:46,640
I like when caricature artists, Travis mentioned Danny Zuko and it made me think about how

289
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:55,920
most caricature artists always have like several caricatures around to their station to like

290
00:16:57,120 --> 00:17:00,720
show you their skills, you know.

291
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:07,680
And when I was younger, by which I mean in my mid to late 30s, I used to think that they

292
00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:10,000
were there, they were, those were for sale too.

293
00:17:10,560 --> 00:17:14,560
Like maybe you just be like, oh shit, is this Michael Keaton going home?

294
00:17:14,560 --> 00:17:15,600
That's fucking cool.

295
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:17,440
I love that.

296
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:21,440
I have to imagine if you walked up and you're like, I'll take the Terminator one.

297
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:22,880
It would be gized about that.

298
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:24,080
The work's already done.

299
00:17:24,080 --> 00:17:28,480
Now the fucking power play is just while they're doing a caricature of someone else in the

300
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:32,800
moment be like $500 and then you take it and walk away.

301
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:33,920
No questions asked.

302
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:37,120
This one's, this one's going in the vault.

303
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:39,600
Can you give me a Terminator?

304
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:42,880
Can you make me a Terminator with the face and what all and the leather jacket and I'll

305
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:43,280
be back.

306
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:48,160
Can you actually just add me to the Terminator one so it looks like Arnold and I sat together?

307
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:54,080
Can you do one where it's mainly Arnold and there's a long line of people waiting to meet

308
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:57,040
him and I'm like 30 in the back.

309
00:17:57,040 --> 00:18:00,800
And I don't want the focus, but I do want it to be obvious it's me.

310
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:05,600
I want people to believe I met him and that seems believable that I met him when he was

311
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:06,000
a caricature.

312
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:11,360
And no one had a phone or a camera or anything and the only option to capture the moment

313
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:12,400
was caricature.

314
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:18,000
Hey, can you do a caricature of this receipt so I don't have to, I don't have a scanner

315
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:21,120
on me and I do want to prove to my employer that I made this purchase.

316
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:21,520
Yeah.

317
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:23,280
So could you do a caricature of my receipt?

318
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:25,520
Why did you make all the fives super big?

319
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:27,360
You goofball.

320
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:28,960
Hey, how about a Yahoo?

321
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:31,680
Yeah, I'd love that Griff, thank you bud.

322
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:33,360
Hey man, you're welcome.

323
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:38,640
You know, hey, real quick, if you ever want to fake being in a relationship, having a

324
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:44,400
caricature artist draw you with some made up person, there's no reason anyone would

325
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:45,920
do that if it wasn't true.

326
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:47,680
I think that would be very convincing.

327
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:49,360
Yeah, probably.

328
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:51,360
This was sent in by several people, thanks everybody.

329
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:52,800
Trying to prove a Canadian girlfriend?

330
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:53,120
Yeah.

331
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:55,600
Just, oh yeah, yeah, we had this done at the boardwalk.

332
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:59,680
Or if you're trying to prove like some kind of physics theory, that would also work I

333
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:01,520
think, have a caricature artist draw it.

334
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:05,120
Sarah asks a question.

335
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:09,600
She says, can you ask fast food restaurants to heat up sauces?

336
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:13,200
You know those little pots of sauces they give you at McDonald's?

337
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:15,280
If you ask them to heat it up, would they?

338
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:19,920
I'm really picky when it comes to sauces and I hate cold slash warm sauces on hot food.

339
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:23,600
Like if you go through a drive through and ask any fast food chain, would they?

340
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:26,000
Any fast food?

341
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:26,480
No.

342
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:27,760
Not any fast food chain.

343
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:28,000
No.

344
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:28,560
Not any fast food chain.

345
00:19:28,560 --> 00:19:32,000
There are definitely some, and we don't need to name them, but they would say no.

346
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:33,280
Yeah.

347
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:36,960
But there are some that I think would be super jive to say yes.

348
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:39,680
And I will say though, I think the drive through is out.

349
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:41,440
I think that has to be counter.

350
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:42,720
The drive through is too far.

351
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:42,960
Right.

352
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:45,760
There's other people that have other things they need to do in there, okay?

353
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:46,240
Okay.

354
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:46,960
Yes.

355
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:47,360
Is it?

356
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:49,520
But that's the only thing I do it though.

357
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:51,280
And I do want hot ketchup.

358
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:51,600
So.

359
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:53,040
Well then you're not getting it.

360
00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:53,920
I mean, if you want.

361
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:55,840
But I want it.

362
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:59,760
If you, then you need to put a microwave in your car like any normal person.

363
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:00,240
But if you want to go.

364
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:03,680
I tried that, but I fucking traveled back in time, didn't I?

365
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:04,720
Well, that'll happen.

366
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:06,400
That will happen.

367
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:10,000
Just trying to make, just trying to make some bagel bites.

368
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,240
I am going to the caveman times.

369
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:13,680
And boys, let me tell you.

370
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:16,320
You became a king because of the bagel bites though.

371
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:16,960
No, man.

372
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:19,200
I was not suited for caveman's time.

373
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:20,480
Bummer.

374
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:22,640
Bummer, they got big tigers.

375
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:26,800
But if you want to get them warm sauces, you've got to go the extra mile.

376
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:29,920
By which I mean talking to someone face to face inside a building.

377
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:30,960
Right.

378
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:34,400
I mean, this would be fixed if it just became sort of standard practice.

379
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:39,760
And listen, and this is, I could train my local McDonald's by going through and saying,

380
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:40,880
I would like hot ketchup.

381
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:42,320
And they would say, we don't have that.

382
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:43,200
And then I would leave.

383
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:47,600
And then the next 15 times I drove through, I would say, hello, how's that hot ketchup coming?

384
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:51,840
And they would say, okay, just to satisfy you, we're going to make hot ketchup for you this

385
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:52,400
one time.

386
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:55,520
And they'll set up a little Bon Marie of ketchup packets.

387
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:58,560
And then the next time I come through, like you still have that Bon Marie set up.

388
00:20:58,560 --> 00:21:00,240
And they'll be like, yeah, we do.

389
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:02,000
And then it's hot ketchup city, baby.

390
00:21:02,560 --> 00:21:10,720
Now, but I will point out that in the question, it clarifies hot sauce on cold food and cold

391
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:12,320
sauce on warm food.

392
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:21,520
And then I do like, because I enjoy the different experience of like hot fries, cold ketchup.

393
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:23,280
Everybody loves that, I think.

394
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:25,440
Not this exact person.

395
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:28,400
They said this one exact person.

396
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:29,520
No, they said hot sauce.

397
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:31,120
But there's a part where they say-

398
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:35,040
When it comes to sauces, I hate cold slash warm sauces on hot food.

399
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:36,400
That's all I said.

400
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:36,880
Hot food.

401
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:39,840
Oh, why would you want a hot sauce on hot food?

402
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:41,360
Dude, my mom said-

403
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:43,440
Hot sauce on hot food, because it's a lovely contrast.

404
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:44,240
What do you mean, why?

405
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:45,840
Well, then there's no contrast.

406
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:48,080
I want the contrast.

407
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:49,840
And I want it now.

408
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:53,360
We're not litigating what this person likes and doesn't like.

409
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:53,840
I am.

410
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:56,160
I am.

411
00:21:56,160 --> 00:21:58,400
And if it pleases the court, I think it's sub.

412
00:22:01,040 --> 00:22:01,540
Nice.

413
00:22:01,540 --> 00:22:10,100
Do you guys, I would for sure run this up the ladder.

414
00:22:10,900 --> 00:22:13,060
I don't know what that looks like, right?

415
00:22:13,060 --> 00:22:14,740
Like, does it go to the king himself?

416
00:22:15,540 --> 00:22:17,300
It's gotta, who is it?

417
00:22:17,300 --> 00:22:20,740
Is it the Arby's voice that we get?

418
00:22:20,740 --> 00:22:23,860
I feel like if anybody's gonna do it, fucking Arby's is gonna be the one that does it.

419
00:22:23,860 --> 00:22:25,460
I feel like Arby's would do it.

420
00:22:25,460 --> 00:22:25,960
Definitely.

421
00:22:26,580 --> 00:22:27,080
Okay.

422
00:22:27,540 --> 00:22:30,020
We have the means and we're listening.

423
00:22:30,020 --> 00:22:30,820
We're listening.

424
00:22:30,820 --> 00:22:31,460
We're listening to you.

425
00:22:31,460 --> 00:22:32,340
We're here for you.

426
00:22:32,340 --> 00:22:32,900
We care.

427
00:22:33,700 --> 00:22:35,140
I want a warm horsey.

428
00:22:35,140 --> 00:22:37,540
Justin, set us free by reading another question.

429
00:22:37,540 --> 00:22:42,020
Well, my email tab has hung up.

430
00:22:42,020 --> 00:22:43,060
I mean, I've got it right here.

431
00:22:43,700 --> 00:22:44,200
Yeah.

432
00:22:44,980 --> 00:22:50,900
My mom, being careful during a pandemic, receives her groceries via curbside pickup.

433
00:22:50,900 --> 00:22:56,020
She recently ordered a case of diet root beer and the store gave her regular root beer by mistake.

434
00:22:57,540 --> 00:22:59,380
None of my family wants to drink the pop.

435
00:22:59,380 --> 00:23:04,900
So she said, quote, I'll leave it on the street for someone to take, end quote.

436
00:23:04,900 --> 00:23:08,020
I thought giving away free pop on the street was strange.

437
00:23:08,020 --> 00:23:11,140
Would you take free cans of pop off the street?

438
00:23:11,140 --> 00:23:13,780
Can anyone offer free street pop?

439
00:23:13,780 --> 00:23:16,580
That's for diet pop only in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.

440
00:23:18,260 --> 00:23:20,260
I mean, absolutely not, right?

441
00:23:20,260 --> 00:23:22,500
I mean, there's no reality in which.

442
00:23:23,860 --> 00:23:26,660
I assume you threw it out for, this has gone bad.

443
00:23:26,660 --> 00:23:29,300
I assume it went bad, right?

444
00:23:29,300 --> 00:23:31,300
Well, you know what fixes this?

445
00:23:32,020 --> 00:23:35,540
A note, two words, free soda.

446
00:23:35,540 --> 00:23:37,140
Not poison.

447
00:23:37,140 --> 00:23:41,780
Not poison, regular root beer.

448
00:23:42,820 --> 00:23:43,320
Wink.

449
00:23:43,780 --> 00:23:44,580
Never warn.

450
00:23:45,140 --> 00:23:45,640
Yeah.

451
00:23:46,260 --> 00:23:52,900
I think that this won't work and this is, I don't know any.

452
00:23:52,900 --> 00:23:57,620
It depends on how busy your street is before you just say it won't work.

453
00:23:57,620 --> 00:24:01,380
If the street's busy enough, someone's going to take it, right?

454
00:24:01,380 --> 00:24:05,940
If you get a big enough selection of people, somebody's going to be like,

455
00:24:05,940 --> 00:24:08,500
this doesn't seem strange to me at all, right?

456
00:24:08,500 --> 00:24:13,300
But if you're only getting like, maybe if it's a small, a quiet suburban street and

457
00:24:13,300 --> 00:24:17,620
you're getting maybe 20 people a week walking, the chances that somebody's going to be like,

458
00:24:17,620 --> 00:24:19,540
ah, yes, just like when I was growing up.

459
00:24:19,540 --> 00:24:21,700
Sure.

460
00:24:21,700 --> 00:24:26,340
If you're on a busy enough street, it's going to vanish one can at a time.

461
00:24:26,340 --> 00:24:28,180
Can I float this one too?

462
00:24:28,180 --> 00:24:30,740
In this challenging year, and it's been hard for all of us,

463
00:24:32,180 --> 00:24:34,020
can she not just drink the root beer?

464
00:24:35,060 --> 00:24:39,940
Let's be, guys, hey, can you just roll up on your mom with this street beer and say,

465
00:24:39,940 --> 00:24:44,340
hey, let's be bad and just do the damn thing?

466
00:24:44,900 --> 00:24:46,260
No one's going to tell on you.

467
00:24:47,060 --> 00:24:47,560
Yeah.

468
00:24:47,560 --> 00:24:49,460
The FBI is not going to kick in the door.

469
00:24:49,460 --> 00:24:50,900
Was that regular cowry?

470
00:24:50,900 --> 00:24:52,820
Nah, it's 2020.

471
00:24:52,820 --> 00:24:54,340
And we're at the tip of it, aren't we?

472
00:24:54,340 --> 00:24:56,420
We're about to jump off into freedom.

473
00:24:56,420 --> 00:24:58,820
Because baby, 2021 looking good.

474
00:24:59,460 --> 00:25:01,220
Yeah, that one's going to be a good year.

475
00:25:01,220 --> 00:25:03,220
This one's going to be the best year yet.

476
00:25:03,220 --> 00:25:08,100
Because I know all the fucking bad people who've been doing bad shit to keep this

477
00:25:08,100 --> 00:25:11,460
beautiful nation of ours just riddled with the COVID.

478
00:25:11,460 --> 00:25:13,220
2021 is going to roll over.

479
00:25:13,220 --> 00:25:15,700
The odometer is going to tick to 2021.

480
00:25:15,700 --> 00:25:18,980
And they're all going to be like, eh, we did enough.

481
00:25:18,980 --> 00:25:20,980
And then it's money in the bank, baby.

482
00:25:21,700 --> 00:25:24,740
I'm just imagining it's going to be like the end of Rock-A-Doodle,

483
00:25:24,740 --> 00:25:27,540
when Chanticleer is going to fucking finally crow,

484
00:25:27,540 --> 00:25:31,540
the sun's going to rise, and all those evil owls are going to melt away to dust.

485
00:25:31,540 --> 00:25:35,300
We bury the dagger in the chest of 2020 and it dies,

486
00:25:35,300 --> 00:25:39,620
taking along all unpleasantness with it as the new beautiful-

487
00:25:39,620 --> 00:25:40,580
There it is.

488
00:25:40,580 --> 00:25:46,980
2021 cresting over the hur- what's that? An all good year?

489
00:25:46,980 --> 00:25:50,980
Who will be the arbiters of which unpleasant things deserve to be dusted?

490
00:25:50,980 --> 00:25:53,380
Why, it's the McElroy brothers, of course.

491
00:25:53,380 --> 00:25:56,100
We'll be deciding what is turned to dust.

492
00:25:56,100 --> 00:25:57,620
Who and what, I should say.

493
00:25:57,620 --> 00:25:59,380
Because there will definitely be some humans in there.

494
00:25:59,380 --> 00:26:00,500
Oh, for sure.

495
00:26:00,500 --> 00:26:03,060
Spoiler alert, we're cleaning house.

496
00:26:03,060 --> 00:26:06,020
Yes, spoiler alert, the cleansing, she is a coming.

497
00:26:06,020 --> 00:26:12,660
Kiss your grandma goodbye if you're not 100% sure that she is a total penis.

498
00:26:14,100 --> 00:26:17,140
And boy, howdy, you better be real, real certain about it.

499
00:26:17,140 --> 00:26:19,460
We got a fine sieve here, folks.

500
00:26:19,460 --> 00:26:20,740
Not a lot making it through.

501
00:26:22,100 --> 00:26:27,300
It's a rigorous, rigorous protocol we are applying.

502
00:26:29,460 --> 00:26:31,060
Just drink the fucking root beer, man.

503
00:26:31,060 --> 00:26:34,180
It's 2020, and we're almost done. Celebrate, pop it off.

504
00:26:34,180 --> 00:26:37,540
And you know what, pretty soon you're gonna have house guests again,

505
00:26:37,540 --> 00:26:38,900
so maybe save it for them.

506
00:26:39,540 --> 00:26:41,300
Because pretty soon it's all gonna be fine.

507
00:26:41,860 --> 00:26:43,220
Yeah, we're almost at the end.

508
00:26:44,340 --> 00:26:45,220
Do you want another Yahoo?

509
00:26:46,100 --> 00:26:49,060
Yeah, yeah, I guess, yeah, sure.

510
00:26:49,060 --> 00:26:51,140
This one was sent in by-

511
00:26:51,140 --> 00:26:52,980
Oh, it's another one that was sent in by many people.

512
00:26:52,980 --> 00:26:53,700
Thanks, everybody.

513
00:26:55,140 --> 00:26:56,260
Takes a whole village.

514
00:26:56,260 --> 00:26:57,140
It does.

515
00:26:57,140 --> 00:26:59,140
It's an anonymous Yahoo Answers user.

516
00:26:59,140 --> 00:27:04,740
I'm gonna call Bainer, asks,

517
00:27:04,740 --> 00:27:06,900
can anyone invent a new way of BBQ

518
00:27:06,900 --> 00:27:08,580
or have they all burn done already?

519
00:27:10,980 --> 00:27:13,780
And that wasn't a play on words, it was B-E-R-N.

520
00:27:15,300 --> 00:27:16,660
Oh, because of Bernie Sanders.

521
00:27:16,660 --> 00:27:19,140
Because Bernie Sanders, the fucking pit master.

522
00:27:21,220 --> 00:27:22,900
You know you get my man in front of the grill

523
00:27:22,900 --> 00:27:24,660
with a fucking high life in his hand,

524
00:27:24,660 --> 00:27:27,460
a high life in his left hand, spatula in the other,

525
00:27:27,460 --> 00:27:29,940
a fucking apron, kiss the cook.

526
00:27:29,940 --> 00:27:31,300
Oh my God, Bernie.

527
00:27:31,300 --> 00:27:33,540
You don't think his apron would say feel the burn?

528
00:27:34,340 --> 00:27:35,780
That would be better.

529
00:27:35,780 --> 00:27:37,220
It would be better.

530
00:27:37,220 --> 00:27:41,860
I'm again asking you to give me five more minutes

531
00:27:42,500 --> 00:27:43,380
on these steaks.

532
00:27:43,380 --> 00:27:44,100
That's good, man.

533
00:27:44,900 --> 00:27:45,700
Do another one, juice.

534
00:27:46,420 --> 00:27:46,740
Okay.

535
00:27:48,180 --> 00:27:50,260
And do this one less like Christopher Lloyd.

536
00:27:51,060 --> 00:27:53,860
Yeah, actually in the movie of Bernie's life,

537
00:27:53,860 --> 00:27:55,220
I cast Christopher Lloyd.

538
00:27:55,220 --> 00:27:56,340
Okay, that tracks.

539
00:27:56,340 --> 00:27:59,060
Larry David thing was too on the nose.

540
00:27:59,060 --> 00:27:59,300
Yes.

541
00:27:59,300 --> 00:28:00,820
Can anyone invent a new way of BBQ

542
00:28:00,820 --> 00:28:02,180
or have they all burned done already?

543
00:28:02,820 --> 00:28:04,660
Ceviche.

544
00:28:05,460 --> 00:28:06,740
Ceviche barbecue.

545
00:28:06,740 --> 00:28:08,900
Ceviche BBQ.

546
00:28:08,900 --> 00:28:10,820
Does that mean you barbecue some meat

547
00:28:10,820 --> 00:28:12,180
and then you ceviche it

548
00:28:12,180 --> 00:28:14,580
or God forbid the other way around?

549
00:28:15,300 --> 00:28:16,020
No, no, no.

550
00:28:16,020 --> 00:28:20,740
You barbecue some meat, ceviche it, grill it again,

551
00:28:21,300 --> 00:28:22,260
and then you taste it.

552
00:28:22,260 --> 00:28:23,460
You're like, I don't know.

553
00:28:23,460 --> 00:28:24,980
Are you trying to say su-vee?

554
00:28:24,980 --> 00:28:26,980
No, sir.

555
00:28:26,980 --> 00:28:27,780
Ceviche.

556
00:28:28,420 --> 00:28:29,780
It's a way of cooking.

557
00:28:29,780 --> 00:28:33,220
You put all of mama's spices on it,

558
00:28:33,220 --> 00:28:34,260
then you ceviche.

559
00:28:35,780 --> 00:28:37,620
And then that's a barbecue, baby.

560
00:28:37,620 --> 00:28:38,420
As long as there's corn.

561
00:28:38,420 --> 00:28:40,260
Pretty sure ceviche just means you put it

562
00:28:40,260 --> 00:28:43,940
in a bath of high citric sort of juices

563
00:28:43,940 --> 00:28:44,980
and you let it sort of-

564
00:28:45,860 --> 00:28:47,300
Right, and that is how it cooks.

565
00:28:48,180 --> 00:28:49,060
It becomes edible.

566
00:28:49,060 --> 00:28:52,100
Now we're talking about sort of very,

567
00:28:52,100 --> 00:28:54,660
very sour pulled pork or something.

568
00:28:54,660 --> 00:28:56,660
That doesn't tickle my buds.

569
00:28:57,220 --> 00:28:58,820
I didn't say it was good.

570
00:28:58,820 --> 00:28:59,780
I said it was new.

571
00:29:01,220 --> 00:29:03,220
And did I mention the corn?

572
00:29:03,220 --> 00:29:05,380
Again, there will be corn served,

573
00:29:05,380 --> 00:29:07,700
which elevates any meal to barbecue.

574
00:29:07,700 --> 00:29:09,780
What if you just, here's mine, here's mine.

575
00:29:09,780 --> 00:29:11,140
May I suggest, I got one.

576
00:29:11,140 --> 00:29:12,420
I'd love to hear your, Shrav.

577
00:29:12,420 --> 00:29:14,740
Take some meat, whatever cut you want.

578
00:29:14,740 --> 00:29:17,780
You can do chicken or beef or pork.

579
00:29:17,780 --> 00:29:23,540
You know, you could even do like a meat substitute,

580
00:29:23,540 --> 00:29:25,220
like a meatless, a Beyond Meat option.

581
00:29:26,180 --> 00:29:29,700
Then you're going to leave it in the sun for 48 hours.

582
00:29:29,700 --> 00:29:30,580
Sun ceviche.

583
00:29:30,580 --> 00:29:36,260
Yeah, uncovered, just loose and raw in the sun for 48 hours.

584
00:29:36,260 --> 00:29:38,260
And after 48 hours, it's done.

585
00:29:38,900 --> 00:29:40,900
Okay, I got one.

586
00:29:40,900 --> 00:29:41,780
Now don't eat it.

587
00:29:42,420 --> 00:29:44,420
Once again, it's not good.

588
00:29:44,420 --> 00:29:45,460
Good, it's just a different-

589
00:29:45,460 --> 00:29:47,060
It's just a different way to do it.

590
00:29:47,060 --> 00:29:49,940
It's kind of like sun tea, but barbecue.

591
00:29:49,940 --> 00:29:54,820
You need to, in your grill, throw down just enough briquettes

592
00:29:54,820 --> 00:29:58,740
or wood chips or whatever, so that it might light

593
00:29:58,740 --> 00:30:00,660
when you throw a match on there, okay?

594
00:30:00,660 --> 00:30:02,420
And then you're going to put a couple of steaks on it,

595
00:30:02,420 --> 00:30:03,860
on the grill, on the barbie,

596
00:30:03,860 --> 00:30:05,300
and you're going to throw the match in

597
00:30:05,300 --> 00:30:06,420
and close the lid real fast.

598
00:30:06,420 --> 00:30:08,980
And then you're going to weld that lid shut,

599
00:30:08,980 --> 00:30:11,540
and then you're going to bury it underground

600
00:30:11,540 --> 00:30:14,900
and like pour the hole with cement so it's filled in.

601
00:30:14,900 --> 00:30:16,260
And then it's quantum beef.

602
00:30:16,260 --> 00:30:18,260
Ooh!

603
00:30:18,260 --> 00:30:24,820
Until that beef is observed, it is cooked and uncooked.

604
00:30:24,820 --> 00:30:26,180
It's quantum beef.

605
00:30:26,180 --> 00:30:28,340
It could be either one, but we won't-

606
00:30:28,340 --> 00:30:30,020
It's both cooked and uncooked,

607
00:30:30,020 --> 00:30:33,540
but it is inedible in a concrete sense.

608
00:30:33,540 --> 00:30:33,940
Maybe not.

609
00:30:33,940 --> 00:30:35,460
Regardless, we're not going to be able to get it out.

610
00:30:35,460 --> 00:30:38,260
Once again, this isn't to be eaten.

611
00:30:38,260 --> 00:30:41,380
Do you even understand molecular gastronomy?

612
00:30:41,380 --> 00:30:43,540
Come on, it's not about eating it.

613
00:30:43,540 --> 00:30:45,380
It's about fucking it up.

614
00:30:45,380 --> 00:30:46,500
Who are you talking to here?

615
00:30:46,500 --> 00:30:48,100
Because I feel like I've been on board with this

616
00:30:48,100 --> 00:30:49,140
first, and you're just-

617
00:30:49,140 --> 00:30:49,620
I don't know.

618
00:30:49,620 --> 00:30:52,340
I think I just kind of got mad at the world there.

619
00:30:52,340 --> 00:30:53,620
Yeah, yeah, that's, phew.

620
00:30:53,620 --> 00:30:55,060
Hey, speaking of, I have an idea.

621
00:30:55,700 --> 00:30:56,900
Liquid nitrogen.

622
00:30:58,580 --> 00:30:58,980
Okay.

623
00:30:59,700 --> 00:31:01,620
I don't know how I would apply it

624
00:31:01,620 --> 00:31:04,660
in such a way that would make it barbecue-esque.

625
00:31:04,660 --> 00:31:06,020
I just know that that's a thing

626
00:31:06,660 --> 00:31:09,060
that like food scientists use a lot.

627
00:31:09,620 --> 00:31:12,100
I saw Mr. Wizard do that with a hot dog once.

628
00:31:12,100 --> 00:31:13,460
He's like, this could be-

629
00:31:13,460 --> 00:31:15,860
I saw him and he had the liquid nitrogen.

630
00:31:15,860 --> 00:31:18,100
He dipped the hot dog in it and he looks at the kid.

631
00:31:18,100 --> 00:31:20,100
He's like, that could be your fucking finger.

632
00:31:20,100 --> 00:31:22,180
Yeah, and then smashes it with a hammer, right?

633
00:31:22,180 --> 00:31:23,380
Remember that?

634
00:31:23,380 --> 00:31:24,340
They could have tried to eat it.

635
00:31:24,340 --> 00:31:26,580
And then he yelled, we're all just meat.

636
00:31:28,900 --> 00:31:34,260
I'm basically 225 hot dogs strapped together with casing.

637
00:31:34,260 --> 00:31:34,660
What?

638
00:31:34,660 --> 00:31:35,860
Old casing.

639
00:31:35,860 --> 00:31:37,620
They saw some shit in Nam.

640
00:31:37,620 --> 00:31:39,540
But sir, what about the soul?

641
00:31:39,540 --> 00:31:40,660
We're just meat.

642
00:31:41,940 --> 00:31:43,460
Meat in dreams.

643
00:31:43,460 --> 00:31:44,980
You're dream meat.

644
00:31:44,980 --> 00:31:46,260
Uh, Mr. Wizard?

645
00:31:47,060 --> 00:31:47,780
Are you okay?

646
00:31:47,780 --> 00:31:48,180
Are you okay?

647
00:31:48,180 --> 00:31:50,340
I was going through some stuff at home.

648
00:31:50,340 --> 00:31:51,060
I'm okay.

649
00:31:51,060 --> 00:31:54,820
As okay as a shambling meat bags can be.

650
00:31:56,100 --> 00:31:59,300
Anyway, you want to learn how to use a computer?

651
00:31:59,300 --> 00:32:00,980
Now get in this big barrel

652
00:32:00,980 --> 00:32:02,980
and push some water out through this tube.

653
00:32:03,540 --> 00:32:06,020
I made a box that look like a coffin.

654
00:32:06,660 --> 00:32:08,660
Hey, do you want to look at the eclipse?

655
00:32:08,660 --> 00:32:08,980
Yeah.

656
00:32:08,980 --> 00:32:10,020
Should we build a bot-

657
00:32:10,020 --> 00:32:10,820
No.

658
00:32:10,820 --> 00:32:11,140
No!

659
00:32:11,140 --> 00:32:13,540
What is it?

660
00:32:13,540 --> 00:32:15,620
You just burned a little bit of your eye meat.

661
00:32:15,620 --> 00:32:16,660
What do I care?

662
00:32:16,660 --> 00:32:19,460
It'll grow back or it won't and then we'll all die.

663
00:32:19,460 --> 00:32:19,860
It's me.

664
00:32:21,780 --> 00:32:23,300
Life is a great experiment.

665
00:32:28,660 --> 00:32:30,340
Mr. Wizard, can I go home now?

666
00:32:30,340 --> 00:32:30,580
No.

667
00:32:31,380 --> 00:32:31,860
No.

668
00:32:31,860 --> 00:32:33,540
You're my son now.

669
00:32:33,540 --> 00:32:35,140
Your mom said I could adopt you.

670
00:32:36,740 --> 00:32:38,420
I promised to teach you science.

671
00:32:38,420 --> 00:32:40,740
Your mom and I came to an understanding.

672
00:32:40,740 --> 00:32:42,260
You're going to college.

673
00:32:42,260 --> 00:32:45,220
I revealed to your mom the arcane meat secret

674
00:32:45,220 --> 00:32:47,060
and she just said she gave up.

675
00:32:47,060 --> 00:32:47,860
Now you're my meat.

676
00:32:50,660 --> 00:32:51,300
I love you.

677
00:32:52,100 --> 00:32:54,180
I plug four wires into a potato

678
00:32:54,180 --> 00:32:55,860
and plug the other ends into a clock.

679
00:32:55,860 --> 00:32:56,660
Nothing's happening.

680
00:32:56,660 --> 00:32:58,100
That's because time's an illusion.

681
00:33:00,660 --> 00:33:03,380
You learned something real more valuable than science today.

682
00:33:04,820 --> 00:33:05,860
Now get me a beer.

683
00:33:06,500 --> 00:33:08,260
Give me seven beers.

684
00:33:08,260 --> 00:33:09,940
How does that potato clock work though?

685
00:33:09,940 --> 00:33:12,580
Damn, I hate the science teachers always do that.

686
00:33:12,580 --> 00:33:13,780
They're like, hey, check this out.

687
00:33:13,780 --> 00:33:15,700
Wire, wire, tato, tato, clock.

688
00:33:15,700 --> 00:33:16,980
Tick, tick, tick, tick, tick.

689
00:33:16,980 --> 00:33:18,660
And then they're like, pretty cool, right?

690
00:33:18,660 --> 00:33:20,980
And you're like, holy fucking shit.

691
00:33:20,980 --> 00:33:22,820
The potato made the thing go?

692
00:33:22,820 --> 00:33:24,020
And they're like, yep.

693
00:33:24,020 --> 00:33:25,460
And then you say, how's that work?

694
00:33:25,460 --> 00:33:26,980
And they say, I'll never tell.

695
00:33:26,980 --> 00:33:28,260
That's fucking up.

696
00:33:28,260 --> 00:33:31,540
They should tell us how the potato makes the clock go, I think.

697
00:33:31,540 --> 00:33:34,180
And if anyone wants to tell me how crystals make a radio,

698
00:33:34,180 --> 00:33:36,820
I've wondered about that for fucking years.

699
00:33:36,820 --> 00:33:37,460
Yeah.

700
00:33:37,460 --> 00:33:40,580
Hey, the one thing I do know, understand the secrets of,

701
00:33:40,580 --> 00:33:41,700
is commercialism.

702
00:33:41,700 --> 00:33:43,220
And I would love if you guys would

703
00:33:43,220 --> 00:33:43,940
accompany me to the money zone.

704
00:33:43,940 --> 00:33:44,440
Please.

705
00:33:54,580 --> 00:33:57,380
First up, first on the bat, it's Squarespace.

706
00:33:57,380 --> 00:33:57,940
Squarespace has a-

707
00:33:57,940 --> 00:33:58,900
You guys heard about this?

708
00:33:58,900 --> 00:33:59,940
You guys heard about this?

709
00:33:59,940 --> 00:34:03,860
Is a batting average of one, which is good for baseball.

710
00:34:03,860 --> 00:34:07,220
And it's not a baseball player, but it is a platform

711
00:34:07,220 --> 00:34:10,740
that lets you build a website from Squarespace.

712
00:34:10,740 --> 00:34:13,540
And you can showcase your work and sell products and services

713
00:34:13,540 --> 00:34:16,420
of all kinds, promote your physical or online business,

714
00:34:16,420 --> 00:34:17,860
or make a website.

715
00:34:17,860 --> 00:34:19,220
And if you want to make a website,

716
00:34:19,780 --> 00:34:21,780
these tools give you the powers of website right

717
00:34:21,780 --> 00:34:22,660
at your fingertips.

718
00:34:22,660 --> 00:34:25,540
They have beautiful customizable templates for websites.

719
00:34:25,540 --> 00:34:29,060
And it's optimized for mobile if people want to do phones.

720
00:34:29,780 --> 00:34:33,540
And you can track your analytics to just see how many just

721
00:34:34,180 --> 00:34:35,460
clickos you're getting.

722
00:34:35,460 --> 00:34:39,380
And then the hosting is secure, whatever that means.

723
00:34:39,380 --> 00:34:41,540
And you don't ever have to upgrade things.

724
00:34:41,540 --> 00:34:42,020
Upgrade?

725
00:34:43,060 --> 00:34:43,700
Boring.

726
00:34:43,700 --> 00:34:45,700
Don't have to do that with Squarespace.

727
00:34:45,700 --> 00:34:49,380

732
00:34:59,060 --> 00:35:01,860
Hey, Griffin, can I talk to you real quick?

733
00:35:01,860 --> 00:35:03,780
Everybody, hey, everybody stop listening.

734
00:35:03,780 --> 00:35:06,340
Um, this isn't, this part's not for you.

735
00:35:07,140 --> 00:35:08,500
I couldn't help but notice, Griffin,

736
00:35:08,500 --> 00:35:11,220
that your stitch is busted.

737
00:35:12,260 --> 00:35:13,140
Oh my God.

738
00:35:13,700 --> 00:35:15,620
Yeah, I don't mean to embarrass you,

739
00:35:15,620 --> 00:35:17,540
but I mean, look at you, dude.

740
00:35:17,540 --> 00:35:18,900
Look, what's that shirt?

741
00:35:18,900 --> 00:35:20,180
What even is that shirt?

742
00:35:20,900 --> 00:35:22,340
It's an assless shirt.

743
00:35:23,300 --> 00:35:25,380
Yes, Griffin, but what does that even mean?

744
00:35:25,380 --> 00:35:26,580
I don't know.

745
00:35:26,580 --> 00:35:29,940
When I bought it from that food truck,

746
00:35:29,940 --> 00:35:31,540
I thought, oh, fuck.

747
00:35:31,540 --> 00:35:33,700
You're wearing mittens as pants, Griffin.

748
00:35:33,700 --> 00:35:34,900
It's not right.

749
00:35:34,900 --> 00:35:36,180
I know it's not right,

750
00:35:36,180 --> 00:35:38,820
but it's been a hard year, Trav, on all of us.

751
00:35:38,820 --> 00:35:41,060
It's been a hard year on all of us for sure, Griffin.

752
00:35:41,060 --> 00:35:44,020
You need to fix your stitch with Stitch Fix.

753
00:35:45,140 --> 00:35:46,580
I'm gonna take another run at that?

754
00:35:46,580 --> 00:35:48,180
Nope, stickin' with it.

755
00:35:48,740 --> 00:35:51,860
Stitch Fix offers clothes hand-selected by expert stylists

756
00:35:51,860 --> 00:35:54,020
for your unique size, style, and budget.

757
00:35:54,020 --> 00:35:58,820
Griffin, I'm gonna say your style is a grown up-

758
00:35:58,820 --> 00:35:59,700
Thank you.

759
00:35:59,700 --> 00:36:00,980
Thank you.

760
00:36:00,980 --> 00:36:01,480
Boy.

761
00:36:02,420 --> 00:36:02,920
Thank you?

762
00:36:02,920 --> 00:36:03,460
Grown up boy.

763
00:36:04,100 --> 00:36:05,140
Like a big boy.

764
00:36:05,140 --> 00:36:06,340
Yeah, sure.

765
00:36:06,340 --> 00:36:07,540
A big boy.

766
00:36:07,540 --> 00:36:08,340
A big grown up boy.

767
00:36:08,340 --> 00:36:08,980
Yeah, no, we get it.

768
00:36:08,980 --> 00:36:12,340
A big grown up boy who's comfortable at a wedding

769
00:36:12,340 --> 00:36:13,220
or a funeral.

770
00:36:14,820 --> 00:36:16,820
I would say that's kind of your style.

771
00:36:16,820 --> 00:36:19,700
I described myself yesterday while on a call with some friends

772
00:36:19,700 --> 00:36:22,420
as having the body of a huge toddler.

773
00:36:22,420 --> 00:36:23,220
So that works.

774
00:36:23,220 --> 00:36:24,180
Yeah, that is great.

775
00:36:25,220 --> 00:36:26,340
That works.

776
00:36:26,340 --> 00:36:29,780
Mine, I like to think my style is benevolent drifter.

777
00:36:29,780 --> 00:36:30,100
Yes, absolutely.

778
00:36:30,100 --> 00:36:32,260
Like that guy who at the beginning of the movie,

779
00:36:32,260 --> 00:36:33,540
you're like, oh, I don't know if I trust him.

780
00:36:33,540 --> 00:36:36,260
But then when the vampires attack, you're glad he's there.

781
00:36:36,260 --> 00:36:37,620
You know, that's my thing.

782
00:36:38,260 --> 00:36:41,460
Justin's not here, but Justin's style is of course vacation dad.

783
00:36:41,460 --> 00:36:42,340
Everyone knows that.

784
00:36:42,980 --> 00:36:45,780
So you can try on pieces at home before you buy,

785
00:36:45,780 --> 00:36:48,100
keep your favorites, and send back the rest.

786
00:36:48,100 --> 00:36:51,300
Stitch Fix has free shipping, easy returns and exchanges,

787
00:36:51,300 --> 00:36:54,180
and a prepaid return envelope is included.

788
00:36:54,180 --> 00:36:56,900
And there's no subscription required.

789
00:36:56,900 --> 00:36:58,340
I would also say just real quick,

790
00:36:58,340 --> 00:37:01,300
my style can also sometimes be rogue wizard,

791
00:37:01,300 --> 00:37:03,060
but that's more when I'm feeling fancy

792
00:37:03,060 --> 00:37:04,180
and want to get dressed up.

793
00:37:04,740 --> 00:37:06,980
Most of the time, benevolent drifter.

794
00:37:06,980 --> 00:37:08,180
It's between those two.

795
00:37:09,220 --> 00:37:11,860
And a lot of those clothes came from Stitch Fix.

796
00:37:12,420 --> 00:37:15,940

One more time, stitchfix.com slash my brother.

801
00:37:28,020 --> 00:37:30,900
Hey, I'm Janet Farney, host of the JV Club podcast.

802
00:37:32,340 --> 00:37:33,620
Ah, high school.

803
00:37:33,620 --> 00:37:37,060
Was it a time of adventure, romance, and discovery?

804
00:37:37,060 --> 00:37:39,300
Class of 95, we did it!

805
00:37:40,420 --> 00:37:45,380
Or a time of angst, disappointment, and confusion?

806
00:37:45,380 --> 00:37:48,420
We're all tied together by four years of trauma at this place,

807
00:37:48,420 --> 00:37:50,180
but enjoy adulthood, I guess.

808
00:37:50,180 --> 00:37:53,700
Yes, the truth is, it was both.

809
00:37:54,820 --> 00:37:57,380
So join me on the JV Club podcast

810
00:37:57,380 --> 00:37:59,940
where I invite some great friends like Kristen Bell,

811
00:37:59,940 --> 00:38:01,540
Angela Kinsey, Oscar Nunez,

812
00:38:01,540 --> 00:38:03,620
Neil Patrick Harris, and Keegan Michael Key

813
00:38:03,620 --> 00:38:05,940
to talk about high school, the good, the bad,

814
00:38:05,940 --> 00:38:07,140
and everything in between.

815
00:38:07,140 --> 00:38:10,180
My teenage mood swings are getting harder to manage.

816
00:38:10,180 --> 00:38:11,220
The JV Club.

817
00:38:11,220 --> 00:38:12,500
Find it on Maximum Fun.

818
00:38:14,100 --> 00:38:15,620
Ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba.

819
00:38:15,620 --> 00:38:15,860
Okay.

820
00:38:15,860 --> 00:38:16,500
Oh.

821
00:38:16,500 --> 00:38:17,620
Ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba.

822
00:38:17,620 --> 00:38:18,100
What do you say?

823
00:38:18,100 --> 00:38:18,600
Okay.

824
00:38:23,220 --> 00:38:24,820
I want a munch squad.

825
00:38:25,540 --> 00:38:27,940
Jingle, jingle, jingle, jingle, jingle.

826
00:38:27,940 --> 00:38:29,940
I want a munch squad.

827
00:38:29,940 --> 00:38:32,900
Jingle, jingle, jingle, jingle, jingle.

828
00:38:32,900 --> 00:38:34,580
Welcome to Holiday Munch Squad.

829
00:38:34,580 --> 00:38:36,100
It's a podcast within a podcast,

830
00:38:36,100 --> 00:38:38,340
profiling the latest and greatest in holiday brand eating.

831
00:38:38,980 --> 00:38:40,340
Uh, I got an excite-

832
00:38:40,340 --> 00:38:41,860
I'm so excited about this one.

833
00:38:41,860 --> 00:38:43,060
Is it donut related?

834
00:38:43,060 --> 00:38:44,580
Because I really miss Count Donut.

835
00:38:44,580 --> 00:38:48,420
No, he's not in this one, but I'll tell you who is here.

836
00:38:48,420 --> 00:38:50,100
Uh, it's McDonald's,

837
00:38:50,100 --> 00:38:52,020
which actually doesn't figure in a munch squad

838
00:38:52,020 --> 00:38:52,820
as much as you think,

839
00:38:52,820 --> 00:38:54,740
because they don't really get buckwilder,

840
00:38:54,740 --> 00:38:55,620
but they have done it.

841
00:38:55,620 --> 00:38:57,060
And this is a new press release.

842
00:38:57,060 --> 00:39:00,340
This just came out today as we're recording this.

843
00:39:00,340 --> 00:39:03,140
And this is a promotion that's kicking off December 14th.

844
00:39:03,140 --> 00:39:05,460
Holiday cheer arrives at McDonald's

845
00:39:05,460 --> 00:39:07,540
as fans can enjoy the favorite menu items

846
00:39:07,540 --> 00:39:09,300
of Santa Claus, the Grinch, and more.

847
00:39:09,300 --> 00:39:10,100
The favorite-

848
00:39:10,100 --> 00:39:10,980
Oh my God.

849
00:39:12,820 --> 00:39:13,700
Okay.

850
00:39:13,700 --> 00:39:15,940
So this is like when Travis Scott, yeah.

851
00:39:15,940 --> 00:39:17,060
Yeah, but it's like that,

852
00:39:17,060 --> 00:39:18,820
except for Santa Claus, the Grinch, and more.

853
00:39:19,380 --> 00:39:21,380
So this year, goodies won't just be found

854
00:39:21,380 --> 00:39:22,500
tucked under the tree.

855
00:39:22,500 --> 00:39:25,700
McDonald's is tapping its elves, gross,

856
00:39:25,700 --> 00:39:28,100
to offer delicious daily in-app deals

857
00:39:28,100 --> 00:39:29,540
that feature the festive favorites

858
00:39:29,540 --> 00:39:30,980
of some classic holiday characters,

859
00:39:31,540 --> 00:39:33,700
including, well, I'm going to skip that

860
00:39:33,700 --> 00:39:35,940
because I don't want to mess up the game that I have.

861
00:39:35,940 --> 00:39:37,300
Oh, I can't wait.

862
00:39:37,940 --> 00:39:38,900
Yeah, baby.

863
00:39:40,180 --> 00:39:43,460
Daily deals will conclude on December 24th

864
00:39:43,460 --> 00:39:47,060
with a certain jolly someone's most treasured treat,

865
00:39:47,060 --> 00:39:48,900
free soft-baked chocolate chip cookies.

866
00:39:48,900 --> 00:39:49,540
That's nice.

867
00:39:49,540 --> 00:39:51,940
You roll in on Christmas Eve to McDonald's.

868
00:39:51,940 --> 00:39:52,980
It's not sad.

869
00:39:52,980 --> 00:39:53,940
You get a free cookie.

870
00:39:55,700 --> 00:39:58,660
Quote from Morgan Flatley,

871
00:39:58,660 --> 00:40:03,060
the US McDonald's CMO, Chief Marketing Officer.

872
00:40:05,380 --> 00:40:07,780
After a year like 2020,

873
00:40:07,780 --> 00:40:10,900
I think we could all use some extra cheer this season.

874
00:40:10,900 --> 00:40:12,340
Go on, Morgan.

875
00:40:12,340 --> 00:40:14,580
Do tell.

876
00:40:14,580 --> 00:40:17,620
What better way to celebrate and get into the holiday spirit

877
00:40:17,620 --> 00:40:20,820
with free McDonald's menu favorites for everyone,

878
00:40:20,820 --> 00:40:25,060
including Rudolph, the abominable snow monster.

879
00:40:25,060 --> 00:40:25,940
Bumble, please.

880
00:40:26,580 --> 00:40:30,260
Please, Bumble, and even, yes, even Scrooge.

881
00:40:30,260 --> 00:40:32,900
Huh, pre or post-Scrooge?

882
00:40:35,940 --> 00:40:37,300
Looking at this, probably pre.

883
00:40:38,260 --> 00:40:40,900
So you can get it in the thing.

884
00:40:40,900 --> 00:40:42,820
So you guys are about to do the hardest thing

885
00:40:42,820 --> 00:40:44,340
you've ever done in your entire lives.

886
00:40:46,020 --> 00:40:48,580
There are 10 days of meals here.

887
00:40:50,020 --> 00:40:52,260
I say meals, but it's really like a free item

888
00:40:52,260 --> 00:40:56,180
that you get to celebrate a Christmas personality.

889
00:40:56,180 --> 00:40:58,500
Hey, Justin, can I just do one from downtown?

890
00:40:59,540 --> 00:41:00,340
Yeah, bud.

891
00:41:00,340 --> 00:41:02,980
The abominable snowman is a McFlurry.

892
00:41:02,980 --> 00:41:03,380
Nope.

893
00:41:03,380 --> 00:41:03,620
Fuck.

894
00:41:03,620 --> 00:41:04,180
You asshole.

895
00:41:04,740 --> 00:41:05,300
Really?

896
00:41:05,300 --> 00:41:06,100
You thought you were at McDonald's.

897
00:41:06,100 --> 00:41:07,540
Try again on the McFlurry.

898
00:41:07,540 --> 00:41:08,020
Try again.

899
00:41:08,020 --> 00:41:08,420
Try again.

900
00:41:08,420 --> 00:41:08,980
Try again.

901
00:41:08,980 --> 00:41:10,500
Is that Frosty the Snowman?

902
00:41:10,500 --> 00:41:11,380
There you go, bud.

903
00:41:11,380 --> 00:41:12,100
There you go, bud.

904
00:41:12,100 --> 00:41:12,980
You got it in two.

905
00:41:12,980 --> 00:41:14,020
That's very respectable.

906
00:41:14,020 --> 00:41:15,220
It's a fuck lot better than you guys

907
00:41:15,220 --> 00:41:16,100
are gonna do with the rest of these.

908
00:41:17,220 --> 00:41:20,740
December 14th, come on down to McDonald's

909
00:41:20,740 --> 00:41:22,580
for a free double cheeseburger.

910
00:41:23,620 --> 00:41:26,420
Huh, a double cheeseburger.

911
00:41:27,380 --> 00:41:29,780
Wait, this is associated with a holiday figure?

912
00:41:30,980 --> 00:41:34,100
A beloved holiday figure.

913
00:41:34,660 --> 00:41:36,260
A double cheeseburger?

914
00:41:36,260 --> 00:41:45,540
Is it Santa Claus?

915
00:41:45,540 --> 00:41:48,660
I feel like it's Santa Claus's December 24th.

916
00:41:48,660 --> 00:41:50,580
I'm gonna give that to you right now, okay?

917
00:41:50,580 --> 00:41:51,700
He gets a free chocolate chip cookie.

918
00:41:51,700 --> 00:41:52,980
I'm gonna say it's the Grinch?

919
00:41:54,340 --> 00:41:55,620
No, bud, it's the Griswolds.

920
00:41:55,620 --> 00:41:57,780
You know the Griswolds from National Lampoon's

921
00:41:57,780 --> 00:41:58,020
Christmas Vacation?

922
00:41:58,020 --> 00:42:00,260
Oh, beloved Christmas icons.

923
00:42:00,260 --> 00:42:04,020
Yeah, they love the free double cheeseburger at McDonald's

924
00:42:04,020 --> 00:42:04,740
and that's what they're getting.

925
00:42:04,740 --> 00:42:07,700
I remember that scene when he's being horny

926
00:42:07,700 --> 00:42:08,660
for the other woman.

927
00:42:09,380 --> 00:42:12,420
And they split four ways, a double cheeseburger.

928
00:42:14,100 --> 00:42:16,100
On the next day you come back in,

929
00:42:16,100 --> 00:42:17,300
you're gonna get a free Big Mac.

930
00:42:18,900 --> 00:42:20,180
Is that the Bumble?

931
00:42:20,180 --> 00:42:21,700
That's gotta be the Bumble, right?

932
00:42:21,700 --> 00:42:22,580
That's the Bumble.

933
00:42:22,580 --> 00:42:23,620
Good job, guys.

934
00:42:23,620 --> 00:42:24,260
That one you got.

935
00:42:24,260 --> 00:42:25,780
Because it's big, just like the Bumble.

936
00:42:26,900 --> 00:42:30,580
The next day, come on in for a free Egg McMuffin.

937
00:42:30,580 --> 00:42:34,100
No, the voice makes me think Grinch.

938
00:42:34,100 --> 00:42:35,220
I mean, it's the Grinch.

939
00:42:35,220 --> 00:42:36,740
That's the Grinchy shit.

940
00:42:36,740 --> 00:42:38,500
He's in there all day, every day.

941
00:42:39,140 --> 00:42:41,060
Give me a McMuffin.

942
00:42:41,060 --> 00:42:41,620
What is that?

943
00:42:41,620 --> 00:42:43,860
It's got that flat ham I love.

944
00:42:46,260 --> 00:42:48,420
Give that part to my dog, Max.

945
00:42:49,780 --> 00:42:52,340
Okay, did you guys see that fucking musical, by the way?

946
00:42:52,340 --> 00:42:52,660
No.

947
00:42:52,660 --> 00:42:55,780
That NBC staged a live stage reading of,

948
00:42:56,580 --> 00:42:59,220
not a staged version of the Grinch musical.

949
00:42:59,220 --> 00:43:01,300
Fucking how did you turn that into two hours?

950
00:43:01,300 --> 00:43:02,340
Well, I'll give you a hint.

951
00:43:02,340 --> 00:43:05,700
They turned the dog into two separate speaking roles.

952
00:43:05,700 --> 00:43:07,860
Yes, an older dog and a younger dog,

953
00:43:08,420 --> 00:43:10,100
both of which had solos.

954
00:43:10,100 --> 00:43:10,740
Fantastic.

955
00:43:10,740 --> 00:43:12,100
Anyway, sorry.

956
00:43:13,220 --> 00:43:16,180
It's a free McDouble the next day, December 17th.

957
00:43:16,180 --> 00:43:16,740
Free McDouble.

958
00:43:16,740 --> 00:43:17,540
What's a McDouble?

959
00:43:17,540 --> 00:43:19,060
Is that just a two patty burger?

960
00:43:19,780 --> 00:43:21,300
It's just a two patty burger, baby.

961
00:43:23,300 --> 00:43:24,100
McDouble, huh?

962
00:43:25,300 --> 00:43:26,420
George Bailey.

963
00:43:27,380 --> 00:43:28,180
No, listen.

964
00:43:28,180 --> 00:43:29,620
It's a free McDouble.

965
00:43:29,620 --> 00:43:30,340
Think, Travis.

966
00:43:30,340 --> 00:43:33,220
Travis, use your fucking brain for once.

967
00:43:36,100 --> 00:43:36,980
Rudolph?

968
00:43:36,980 --> 00:43:37,860
I don't know, man.

969
00:43:39,700 --> 00:43:41,300
If I say Rudolph for all of these,

970
00:43:41,300 --> 00:43:43,300
eventually I'll get a hit.

971
00:43:43,300 --> 00:43:43,860
Double.

972
00:43:43,860 --> 00:43:45,540
Well, it's John McClain.

973
00:43:47,380 --> 00:43:50,020
Oh, because it's McDouble McClain.

974
00:43:50,020 --> 00:43:50,580
Is that anything?

975
00:43:50,580 --> 00:43:52,020
Yeah, there's a lot of things, though,

976
00:43:52,020 --> 00:43:54,660
because McMuffin was the last one.

977
00:43:54,660 --> 00:43:57,860
So yeah, that is a wild pick.

978
00:43:57,860 --> 00:44:01,300
Free, medium, world famous fries

979
00:44:01,300 --> 00:44:02,660
with, according to this picture,

980
00:44:03,220 --> 00:44:04,260
two packets of ketchup.

981
00:44:05,860 --> 00:44:06,900
George Bailey.

982
00:44:06,900 --> 00:44:08,180
Is that one Rudolph?

983
00:44:09,300 --> 00:44:10,820
That one's Rudolph, Greg.

984
00:44:10,820 --> 00:44:11,540
Good job.

985
00:44:11,540 --> 00:44:12,180
Yeah!

986
00:44:12,180 --> 00:44:14,340
Okay, but I tapped.

987
00:44:14,340 --> 00:44:17,860
Unless Donner and Blitzen are the next.

988
00:44:17,860 --> 00:44:19,860
I literally can't think of too many other

989
00:44:20,420 --> 00:44:22,180
Christmas time characters.

990
00:44:22,180 --> 00:44:24,100
There is a beloved Christmas icon

991
00:44:24,100 --> 00:44:25,780
that's going to slide you over

992
00:44:25,780 --> 00:44:29,780
on a free six-piece McNugget on December 19th.

993
00:44:29,780 --> 00:44:30,740
Well, that's Scridge.

994
00:44:30,740 --> 00:44:32,020
He loves them nugs.

995
00:44:32,020 --> 00:44:32,420
Elf?

996
00:44:32,420 --> 00:44:33,380
No, that's incorrect.

997
00:44:33,380 --> 00:44:34,100
Elf?

998
00:44:34,100 --> 00:44:35,060
At 8 p.m.

999
00:44:35,060 --> 00:44:35,700
What?

1000
00:44:35,700 --> 00:44:37,780
On that day, you could be enjoying the...

1001
00:44:38,980 --> 00:44:40,420
8 p.m., you could be enjoying the

1002
00:44:41,140 --> 00:44:43,620
McElroy Family Candle Night Spectacular,

1003
00:44:44,820 --> 00:44:47,940
and you could be eating a six-piece nugget

1004
00:44:47,940 --> 00:44:50,660
provided to you by beloved Christmas icon,

1005
00:44:51,220 --> 00:44:53,460
Gizmo from Gremlins.

1006
00:44:53,460 --> 00:44:54,820
Wowzers, wowzers.

1007
00:44:54,820 --> 00:44:58,100
They have 10 of these, and one of them's Gizmo.

1008
00:45:00,100 --> 00:45:04,740
If one of them, if Gizmo gets on the freebie list,

1009
00:45:04,740 --> 00:45:06,900
and Jesus Christ does not.

1010
00:45:07,700 --> 00:45:08,420
Thank you.

1011
00:45:08,420 --> 00:45:11,220
I feel like every McDonald's is going to be burned

1012
00:45:11,220 --> 00:45:13,460
to the ground by a certain type of,

1013
00:45:13,460 --> 00:45:15,060
let's say, Chick-fil-A fan.

1014
00:45:16,740 --> 00:45:19,140
Free hotcakes, December 20th.

1015
00:45:19,140 --> 00:45:20,580
Who's bringing you free hotcakes?

1016
00:45:21,620 --> 00:45:22,420
Is that one Elf?

1017
00:45:23,700 --> 00:45:24,660
That one's Elf, Greg.

1018
00:45:24,660 --> 00:45:25,380
Griffin, congratulations.

1019
00:45:25,380 --> 00:45:26,660
Okay, that actually makes sense.

1020
00:45:26,660 --> 00:45:28,820
That's one of the very few that tracks.

1021
00:45:28,820 --> 00:45:29,220
He loves Sarah.

1022
00:45:29,220 --> 00:45:31,380
I feel like they came up with that one first.

1023
00:45:31,380 --> 00:45:31,780
Yeah.

1024
00:45:31,780 --> 00:45:32,580
Maybe, and they were like,

1025
00:45:32,580 --> 00:45:34,580
this is a great idea for a promotion.

1026
00:45:34,580 --> 00:45:35,780
Let's commit to it.

1027
00:45:35,780 --> 00:45:40,740
Now, the next day, one hot coffee, please.

1028
00:45:40,740 --> 00:45:41,220
Scrooge.

1029
00:45:42,100 --> 00:45:42,820
That's Scrooge.

1030
00:45:42,820 --> 00:45:43,060
Wow.

1031
00:45:43,060 --> 00:45:44,500
That's Scrooge.

1032
00:45:44,500 --> 00:45:46,260
We did Frosty Snowman on the 22nd.

1033
00:45:46,820 --> 00:45:47,940
That's a free McFlurry.

1034
00:45:47,940 --> 00:45:49,780
23rd, this is our last one,

1035
00:45:49,780 --> 00:45:51,460
because obviously 24th is Santa.

1036
00:45:51,460 --> 00:45:54,580
23rd is a free bakery item.

1037
00:45:54,580 --> 00:45:55,700
That could be,

1038
00:45:55,700 --> 00:45:57,620
of course, we all know that there's a new line of bakery items.

1039
00:45:57,620 --> 00:46:02,100
Yes, there's a delightful marquee

1040
00:46:02,100 --> 00:46:04,100
outside of my local McDonald's that says,

1041
00:46:04,740 --> 00:46:06,020
new bakery items.

1042
00:46:06,020 --> 00:46:06,980
And then on another line,

1043
00:46:07,540 --> 00:46:08,180
tastes good.

1044
00:46:10,740 --> 00:46:13,380
I'm gonna say George Bailey from It's a Wonderful Life.

1045
00:46:15,300 --> 00:46:16,180
That would be good.

1046
00:46:16,900 --> 00:46:18,500
Can I also say George Bailey?

1047
00:46:19,140 --> 00:46:19,620
No.

1048
00:46:19,620 --> 00:46:21,300
Okay, ah.

1049
00:46:21,300 --> 00:46:22,100
But you're really,

1050
00:46:22,100 --> 00:46:25,220
you're actually weirdly close with the first name.

1051
00:46:25,220 --> 00:46:25,860
George Clinton.

1052
00:46:25,860 --> 00:46:28,020
But the first name isn't George.

1053
00:46:28,660 --> 00:46:29,860
George from Seinfeld?

1054
00:46:30,420 --> 00:46:31,220
Yeah, he loves them.

1055
00:46:33,060 --> 00:46:33,540
Jesus.

1056
00:46:33,540 --> 00:46:34,820
Wait, no, wait, no, let's,

1057
00:46:35,860 --> 00:46:38,740
you are so close.

1058
00:46:38,740 --> 00:46:39,780
Is it Seinfeld?

1059
00:46:39,780 --> 00:46:40,820
Why would it be Seinfeld?

1060
00:46:40,820 --> 00:46:42,180
So fucking close.

1061
00:46:42,180 --> 00:46:43,620
Please, you're so close.

1062
00:46:44,260 --> 00:46:45,540
Just try a little bit harder.

1063
00:46:46,740 --> 00:46:47,700
Think for a second.

1064
00:46:47,700 --> 00:46:48,580
You can do this.

1065
00:46:48,580 --> 00:46:51,060
Oh, it's the Festivus.

1066
00:46:51,060 --> 00:46:53,060
I didn't watch enough fucking Seinfeld.

1067
00:46:53,060 --> 00:46:54,420
I know they had their own.

1068
00:46:54,420 --> 00:46:56,260
It's not George Costanza.

1069
00:46:57,140 --> 00:46:59,220
Dad, George's dad, Costanza.

1070
00:46:59,940 --> 00:47:01,940
Frank Costanza and the rest of us

1071
00:47:01,940 --> 00:47:04,900
were celebrating Festivus on the third

1072
00:47:04,900 --> 00:47:06,820
with a free bakery item.

1073
00:47:06,820 --> 00:47:08,660
You know, 2020's been hard

1074
00:47:08,660 --> 00:47:11,060
so this Grinch is giving you a McMuffin.

1075
00:47:11,620 --> 00:47:14,180
That is absolutely bonkers.

1076
00:47:14,180 --> 00:47:16,020
It's an in-app deal only though, y'all.

1077
00:47:16,020 --> 00:47:19,940
So just kind of keep that in mind.

1078
00:47:19,940 --> 00:47:21,460
I also have to read here

1079
00:47:21,460 --> 00:47:23,460
that Seinfeld and all related characters

1080
00:47:23,460 --> 00:47:26,260
and elements are TM Castle Rock Entertainment,

1081
00:47:26,260 --> 00:47:27,540
Elf and all related characters.

1082
00:47:27,540 --> 00:47:29,220
Now it's a business thing again.

1083
00:47:29,220 --> 00:47:31,940
Oh God, commercialism.

1084
00:47:31,940 --> 00:47:33,460
I thought this was just a fun thing

1085
00:47:33,460 --> 00:47:35,540
our friend McDonald's was doing.

1086
00:47:35,540 --> 00:47:36,100
Yeah, they ruined it.

1087
00:47:36,100 --> 00:47:38,820
With our other friends, George's dad

1088
00:47:38,820 --> 00:47:40,020
whose name I already forgot.

1089
00:47:41,700 --> 00:47:42,580
Frank Ocean.

1090
00:47:44,340 --> 00:47:45,460
I am a college student

1091
00:47:45,460 --> 00:47:47,700
and I really like giving gifts.

1092
00:47:47,700 --> 00:47:49,940
My roommate is really into fantasy

1093
00:47:49,940 --> 00:47:51,540
slash Lord of the Rings type stuff

1094
00:47:51,540 --> 00:47:53,620
so I recently bought him a map of his home state

1095
00:47:53,620 --> 00:47:56,020
hand-drawn in a fantasy style

1096
00:47:56,020 --> 00:47:57,380
to give to him for Christmas.

1097
00:47:57,380 --> 00:47:58,580
A couple of days after it arrived,

1098
00:47:58,580 --> 00:48:00,180
he mentioned how he saw a Facebook app

1099
00:48:00,180 --> 00:48:01,300
for the same thing

1100
00:48:01,300 --> 00:48:02,580
and how stupid he thought it was

1101
00:48:02,580 --> 00:48:04,740
to get a fantasy map of your home state.

1102
00:48:04,740 --> 00:48:07,060
Right now the map is collecting dust in my closet.

1103
00:48:07,060 --> 00:48:09,140
Brothers, what do I do with this gift?

1104
00:48:09,140 --> 00:48:12,100
That's from Sheepish Schlepp in Chicago.

1105
00:48:12,100 --> 00:48:15,220
Hey, it's me, Chicago John.

1106
00:48:15,220 --> 00:48:16,340
Forget about it.

1107
00:48:17,300 --> 00:48:18,660
Forget about it.

1108
00:48:19,380 --> 00:48:22,100
Try my deep dish pizza.

1109
00:48:22,980 --> 00:48:25,460
It is me, Chicago Cubsman.

1110
00:48:26,100 --> 00:48:27,300
It's my club.

1111
00:48:27,300 --> 00:48:30,420
I'll splash the fantasy map whenever I want.

1112
00:48:33,300 --> 00:48:35,780
Is it possible when your roommate said it was dumb

1113
00:48:35,780 --> 00:48:37,700
what they meant is it's really cool

1114
00:48:37,700 --> 00:48:39,940
and they're embarrassed at how cool they think it is

1115
00:48:40,500 --> 00:48:41,860
and they're trying to seem cool

1116
00:48:41,860 --> 00:48:43,460
by saying like, oh yeah, it's dumb.

1117
00:48:43,460 --> 00:48:45,220
I'd hate to get that.

1118
00:48:45,220 --> 00:48:47,060
Because it popped up in their Facebook ads

1119
00:48:47,060 --> 00:48:49,060
so that must mean they really want it, right?

1120
00:48:49,060 --> 00:48:50,980
Listen to Facebook, okay?

1121
00:48:50,980 --> 00:48:52,180
Facebook's never wrong.

1122
00:48:52,180 --> 00:48:52,680
No.

1123
00:48:53,700 --> 00:48:55,940
I took a screenshot of a pretty bodacious shirt

1124
00:48:55,940 --> 00:48:56,980
that it recommended to me

1125
00:48:57,540 --> 00:49:00,340
that I'm going to try and find while I continue talking.

1126
00:49:00,340 --> 00:49:02,500
I think you've got to give your roommate

1127
00:49:02,500 --> 00:49:04,180
the fucking map anyway

1128
00:49:04,180 --> 00:49:05,460
and then you can be like,

1129
00:49:07,060 --> 00:49:08,580
I'm being ironic obviously.

1130
00:49:09,220 --> 00:49:09,540
Get it?

1131
00:49:09,540 --> 00:49:09,940
Get it?

1132
00:49:09,940 --> 00:49:10,980
How silly it is?

1133
00:49:10,980 --> 00:49:11,940
Can you imagine?

1134
00:49:11,940 --> 00:49:13,860
I would say, give it to your roommate.

1135
00:49:14,580 --> 00:49:16,500
Act like they never said anything.

1136
00:49:17,700 --> 00:49:18,660
I don't like that.

1137
00:49:19,460 --> 00:49:21,220
I don't love it because that both gives them

1138
00:49:21,220 --> 00:49:22,340
a gift they won't like

1139
00:49:22,340 --> 00:49:24,980
and also says I don't listen to you.

1140
00:49:24,980 --> 00:49:28,020
Well, the other option is you have it in your closet

1141
00:49:28,020 --> 00:49:29,940
until you forget about it and move out

1142
00:49:29,940 --> 00:49:30,980
and don't take it with you.

1143
00:49:32,740 --> 00:49:34,420
I would lean into it.

1144
00:49:34,420 --> 00:49:36,180
I like the ironic thing.

1145
00:49:36,180 --> 00:49:38,660
Like, I thought this is such a crack up

1146
00:49:39,220 --> 00:49:40,740
when you mentioned it being bad.

1147
00:49:40,740 --> 00:49:44,020
Also, my friend Justin is a podcaster

1148
00:49:44,020 --> 00:49:45,620
and he wanted me to ask you,

1149
00:49:45,620 --> 00:49:48,340
where the fuck do you get off being hugely into fantasy

1150
00:49:48,340 --> 00:49:50,820
but being snide about fantasy maps of home state?

1151
00:49:50,820 --> 00:49:52,980
Because it actually sounds really cool for me.

1152
00:49:52,980 --> 00:49:54,260
It sounds so cool.

1153
00:49:55,060 --> 00:49:56,580
I'm just saying if somebody wants to tell me

1154
00:49:56,580 --> 00:49:58,420
where to get one of these of West Virginia,

1155
00:49:58,420 --> 00:50:00,260
I would take the hell out of that.

1156
00:50:01,540 --> 00:50:02,420
Oh, yeah.

1157
00:50:02,420 --> 00:50:03,460
Batten down the hatches.

1158
00:50:03,460 --> 00:50:04,420
People know how to get at you.

1159
00:50:04,420 --> 00:50:05,140
Yeah, that's a good point.

1160
00:50:05,140 --> 00:50:06,100
Where can I get one of those?

1161
00:50:06,100 --> 00:50:08,980
Hey, where can I commission something like that

1162
00:50:08,980 --> 00:50:11,460
but done in Fallout 76

1163
00:50:11,460 --> 00:50:13,700
but also in a universe where Fallout 76

1164
00:50:13,700 --> 00:50:14,660
was actually really good.

1165
00:50:14,660 --> 00:50:15,460
It was a good game.

1166
00:50:15,460 --> 00:50:16,020
Yeah, I mean, we're gonna-

1167
00:50:16,020 --> 00:50:17,460
And also Fallout Boys in it.

1168
00:50:17,460 --> 00:50:18,580
Oh, yeah.

1169
00:50:18,580 --> 00:50:19,060
Shit.

1170
00:50:19,060 --> 00:50:21,060
And Fallout Boy draw me that poster

1171
00:50:21,060 --> 00:50:23,700
and I mean, all four of them at the same time.

1172
00:50:23,700 --> 00:50:24,580
Holding the pencil all four of you.

1173
00:50:24,580 --> 00:50:26,420
Just an exquisite Corpse style.

1174
00:50:26,420 --> 00:50:28,020
And they're all kissing.

1175
00:50:28,020 --> 00:50:30,500
That's also, so I found the image,

1176
00:50:30,500 --> 00:50:32,660
the screenshot I took from a company.

1177
00:50:32,660 --> 00:50:36,820
It's a sponsored suggested advertisement on my feed.

1178
00:50:36,820 --> 00:50:39,140
Which I will admit is largely dormant.

1179
00:50:39,140 --> 00:50:41,940
So I'm not giving them a lot of cookies.

1180
00:50:41,940 --> 00:50:44,500
I'm not giving them any cookies to deal with.

1181
00:50:45,300 --> 00:50:48,180
This is a get the perfect gift for loved ones.

1182
00:50:48,180 --> 00:50:48,980
Order here.

1183
00:50:49,540 --> 00:50:52,180
And then it's a shirt that's a white t-shirt

1184
00:50:52,180 --> 00:50:55,060
and big black letters in like 14 different fonts.

1185
00:50:55,060 --> 00:50:58,420
It says, sorry, I am already taken

1186
00:50:58,420 --> 00:51:01,620
by a freaking awesome husband.

1187
00:51:01,620 --> 00:51:03,700
He has anger issues and a serious dislike

1188
00:51:03,700 --> 00:51:04,740
for stupid people.

1189
00:51:04,740 --> 00:51:08,180
He's a perfect mixture of Prince Charming and warrior.

1190
00:51:08,740 --> 00:51:10,500
He is my whole world.

1191
00:51:10,500 --> 00:51:12,420
I love him forever and always.

1192
00:51:12,420 --> 00:51:14,900
Mess with me and they'll never find your body.

1193
00:51:14,900 --> 00:51:16,100
Yes, he bought me this.

1194
00:51:16,900 --> 00:51:17,780
Fucking awesome.

1195
00:51:17,780 --> 00:51:19,300
Have you thought about buying that for Rachel?

1196
00:51:20,900 --> 00:51:22,900
I did do that.

1197
00:51:22,900 --> 00:51:23,780
And it's her.

1198
00:51:23,780 --> 00:51:24,420
She'll love that.

1199
00:51:24,420 --> 00:51:27,940
Yeah, it's, we both call it her outside shirt.

1200
00:51:27,940 --> 00:51:32,740
Cause it's the shirt she wears anytime we go.

1201
00:51:32,740 --> 00:51:34,820
The shirt she wears anytime we go.

1202
00:51:34,820 --> 00:51:36,020
Y'all, if you could see this,

1203
00:51:36,020 --> 00:51:40,340
the absolutely Lovecraftian sort of

1204
00:51:40,340 --> 00:51:44,580
tome of different fonts that is on this one fucking t-shirt,

1205
00:51:44,580 --> 00:51:46,260
it would completely boggle your mind.

1206
00:51:47,220 --> 00:51:47,780
I must.

1207
00:51:47,780 --> 00:51:50,420
Yeah, I love targeted t-shirts like that.

1208
00:51:51,860 --> 00:51:53,860
I think it could be more generic.

1209
00:51:53,860 --> 00:51:55,140
Like if the t-shirt was like,

1210
00:51:55,140 --> 00:52:01,940
yeah, I'm connected to another person who I see a lot.

1211
00:52:01,940 --> 00:52:06,420
And they're a mixture of carbon and other stuff.

1212
00:52:07,140 --> 00:52:08,180
And if you-

1213
00:52:08,180 --> 00:52:09,300
They're just carbon.

1214
00:52:09,300 --> 00:52:10,500
They're just me.

1215
00:52:10,500 --> 00:52:11,380
They're dreams.

1216
00:52:12,340 --> 00:52:14,580
They're meeting dreams wrapped up.

1217
00:52:14,580 --> 00:52:17,300
I do wish I could just get a shirt that just said

1218
00:52:17,300 --> 00:52:19,380
Prince Charming and Warrior on it.

1219
00:52:20,020 --> 00:52:20,740
He is my whole world.

1220
00:52:20,740 --> 00:52:21,620
What do you think is,

1221
00:52:21,620 --> 00:52:24,580
now are you 50-50 Prince Charming and Warrior Griffin?

1222
00:52:24,580 --> 00:52:27,300
Or do you think it's like 60-40 or where are you at?

1223
00:52:27,300 --> 00:52:30,100
Well, I'm Prince Charming and Warrior

1224
00:52:30,100 --> 00:52:32,900
in the streets and sheets, respectively.

1225
00:52:33,860 --> 00:52:36,820
There's gotta be a better way to say that.

1226
00:52:36,820 --> 00:52:39,140
I can be, but sometimes I'm a Warrior on the streets

1227
00:52:39,140 --> 00:52:41,060
and a Prince Charming in the streets.

1228
00:52:41,060 --> 00:52:43,380
I think if I were to choose,

1229
00:52:43,380 --> 00:52:45,620
I would want Prince Charming in the sheets

1230
00:52:45,620 --> 00:52:47,220
and Warrior on the streets.

1231
00:52:47,220 --> 00:52:51,140
Well, sometimes you get the one that you ask for.

1232
00:52:52,820 --> 00:52:56,980
I fucked up recently with my Facebook algorithm

1233
00:52:56,980 --> 00:53:00,020
and then I mentioned on there that Sydney and I

1234
00:53:00,020 --> 00:53:02,180
had watched some Schitt's Creek.

1235
00:53:02,980 --> 00:53:06,020
And then the moment I posted it,

1236
00:53:06,020 --> 00:53:09,220
the fucking t-shirt manufacturers were like,

1237
00:53:09,220 --> 00:53:10,340
he's done it.

1238
00:53:10,340 --> 00:53:11,460
Justin's finally done it.

1239
00:53:11,460 --> 00:53:12,260
He did it.

1240
00:53:12,260 --> 00:53:13,060
Open the gates.

1241
00:53:13,620 --> 00:53:14,580
Here it comes.

1242
00:53:14,580 --> 00:53:17,220
Here comes all the hot bad holiday sweaters.

1243
00:53:17,220 --> 00:53:18,020
Here's everything.

1244
00:53:18,020 --> 00:53:19,220
Let him have it all.

1245
00:53:19,220 --> 00:53:20,660
Fantasy maps of Schitt's Creek.

1246
00:53:21,380 --> 00:53:22,660
Toys for Schitt's Creek.

1247
00:53:23,220 --> 00:53:24,580
Schitt's Creek toilet paper.

1248
00:53:25,380 --> 00:53:26,420
Open the gates.

1249
00:53:26,420 --> 00:53:27,380
Let it all fly.

1250
00:53:28,420 --> 00:53:29,220
That scared me.

1251
00:53:30,900 --> 00:53:32,660
If anybody wants to start a business

1252
00:53:32,660 --> 00:53:35,700
doing Lord of the Rings style maps of Schitt's Creek,

1253
00:53:35,700 --> 00:53:36,820
I would take that.

1254
00:53:36,820 --> 00:53:38,180
I would take one, please.

1255
00:53:38,180 --> 00:53:39,860
Fucking guarantee.

1256
00:53:39,860 --> 00:53:41,140
I'm going to type in.

1257
00:53:41,140 --> 00:53:43,940
I'm going to fuck my algorithm deeply.

1258
00:53:43,940 --> 00:53:47,620
I'm going to ruin my Google for the rest of my life

1259
00:53:47,620 --> 00:53:48,260
and type in.

1260
00:53:48,980 --> 00:53:50,980
I will never dig out of this algorithmic hole

1261
00:53:50,980 --> 00:53:52,180
I'm about to dig for myself.

1262
00:53:52,180 --> 00:53:53,860
I hesitate to even type it,

1263
00:53:53,860 --> 00:53:56,500
but I am going to type fantasy map of Schitt's Creek

1264
00:53:58,180 --> 00:54:00,500
and see what I get.

1265
00:54:00,500 --> 00:54:02,740
And yep, there's a lot.

1266
00:54:03,380 --> 00:54:08,660
My computer is now giving itself a wedgie.

1267
00:54:12,180 --> 00:54:12,580
Brutal.

1268
00:54:13,780 --> 00:54:14,820
Just brutal stuff.

1269
00:54:14,820 --> 00:54:16,660
Well, can you take us to the bridge, Justin?

1270
00:54:17,620 --> 00:54:18,180
Yeah, bud.

1271
00:54:18,180 --> 00:54:20,260
Thanks so much for listening to our podcast.

1272
00:54:21,460 --> 00:54:23,060
We hope you've enjoyed it.

1273
00:54:23,060 --> 00:54:24,100
If you enjoyed it one third,

1274
00:54:24,100 --> 00:54:26,820
as much as we enjoyed making it, then-

1275
00:54:26,820 --> 00:54:29,060
Then that's not a very good return on investment.

1276
00:54:29,060 --> 00:54:30,180
No, it isn't.

1277
00:54:30,180 --> 00:54:33,540
But still, we hope you had fun.

1278
00:54:33,540 --> 00:54:35,780
Thank you so much for joining us.

1279
00:54:35,780 --> 00:54:38,500
And we have so much to tell you about real-

1280
00:54:38,500 --> 00:54:40,100
I'm just going to blow through some real quick.

1281
00:54:40,660 --> 00:54:43,380
I made a YouTube series with my friend Dwight Slappy.

1282
00:54:43,380 --> 00:54:44,340
It's called Taste of Luxury.

1283
00:54:44,340 --> 00:54:46,180
It's on YouTube on the McElroy Family channel.

1284
00:54:46,180 --> 00:54:47,300
There's five parts of it.

1285
00:54:47,300 --> 00:54:49,140
If you like the Bambam TV show, you will like this.

1286

Please watch it.

1288
00:54:51,220 --> 00:54:53,140
We made it in 2017.

1289
00:54:53,140 --> 00:54:55,620
And we've been working on bringing it to you ever since then.

1290
00:54:55,620 --> 00:54:57,300
