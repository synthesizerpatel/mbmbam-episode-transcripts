1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,160
The McElroy brothers are not experts,

2
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:09,120
and their advice should never be followed.

3
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:12,040
Travis insists he's a sexpert,

4
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:17,760
but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

5
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:20,960
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only

6
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:23,200
so the babies out there will know

7
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:26,660
how cool they are for listening.

8
00:00:26,660 --> 00:00:28,660
What's up, you cool baby?

9
00:00:28,660 --> 00:00:32,660
It's the start of something beautiful.

10
00:00:32,660 --> 00:00:34,660
A small acquaintance has blossomed,

11
00:00:34,660 --> 00:00:38,660
it's ripened into a precious friendship.

12
00:00:38,660 --> 00:00:42,660
I could have never seen what was coming for me.

13
00:00:42,660 --> 00:00:46,660
Hangs at the skate park, hangs by the beach.

14
00:00:46,660 --> 00:00:50,660
My life, it feels like

15
00:00:50,660 --> 00:00:56,660
My life, it feels like

16
00:00:56,660 --> 00:01:02,660
Life, ah, it's better, it's better with you

17
00:01:02,660 --> 00:01:08,660
My life, ah, it's better, it's better with you

18
00:01:08,660 --> 00:01:14,660
This is true, ah, it's better, it's better with two

19
00:01:14,660 --> 00:01:22,660
My life, ah, it's better with you

20
00:01:22,660 --> 00:01:24,660
This is my clear chair.

21
00:01:24,660 --> 00:01:26,660
Let's talk about the chairs for one second.

22
00:01:26,660 --> 00:01:29,660
We have, everyone agrees, the most visually boring show

23
00:01:29,660 --> 00:01:31,660
that you could possibly go see,

24
00:01:31,660 --> 00:01:35,660
and someone took the agency to give us some artistic chairs.

25
00:01:35,660 --> 00:01:36,660
This is a first.

26
00:01:36,660 --> 00:01:38,660
We have these beautiful clear chairs.

27
00:01:38,660 --> 00:01:41,660
They're beautiful, and it has spiced up the show visually.

28
00:01:41,660 --> 00:01:42,660
Hi, very welcome, my brother.

29
00:01:42,660 --> 00:01:44,660
My brother, me and my show for the modern era.

30
00:01:44,660 --> 00:01:46,660
I would say Cold Lucite.

31
00:01:46,660 --> 00:01:49,660
And I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy.

32
00:01:49,660 --> 00:01:56,660
And I'm your middle brother, Travis McElroy.

33
00:01:56,660 --> 00:02:03,660
Et cetera.

34
00:02:03,660 --> 00:02:07,660
And I'm your sweet, were you really?

35
00:02:07,660 --> 00:02:15,660
Were you really about to start this show after your introduction?

36
00:02:15,660 --> 00:02:16,660
Feels on brand, doesn't it?

37
00:02:16,660 --> 00:02:18,660
It does a little bit.

38
00:02:18,660 --> 00:02:20,660
I'm your sweet baby brother in 30 Under 30 Media,

39
00:02:20,660 --> 00:02:31,660
Luminary Griffin McElroy.

40
00:02:31,660 --> 00:02:33,660
Paul, help, I'm not on the wifi, Paul.

41
00:02:33,660 --> 00:02:34,660
You gotta help me.

42
00:02:34,660 --> 00:02:35,660
Can you help me?

43
00:02:35,660 --> 00:02:36,660
Help me, I'm not on the wifi, Travis.

44
00:02:36,660 --> 00:02:37,660
Help me, bud.

45
00:02:37,660 --> 00:02:41,660
I will admit, this is not the reception I was expecting.

46
00:02:41,660 --> 00:02:44,660
Yeah, let's take a second to talk about it.

47
00:02:44,660 --> 00:02:48,660
I would actually like to recognize our,

48
00:02:48,660 --> 00:02:51,660
if we could actually get house lights on,

49
00:02:51,660 --> 00:02:55,660
on the house lights, if those could come.

50
00:02:55,660 --> 00:02:56,660
Not the balcony, though.

51
00:02:56,660 --> 00:02:57,660
Not the balcony.

52
00:02:57,660 --> 00:02:58,660
Turn the balcony off.

53
00:02:58,660 --> 00:02:59,660
No, no, no, no, no.

54
00:02:59,660 --> 00:03:00,660
You need to know about the balcony.

55
00:03:00,660 --> 00:03:01,660
Yeah, it is them.

56
00:03:01,660 --> 00:03:04,660
Continue the sort of like Kevin McCallister tableau

57
00:03:04,660 --> 00:03:07,660
of human beings and the balcony sort of linked up

58
00:03:07,660 --> 00:03:09,660
by strings and pulleys.

59
00:03:09,660 --> 00:03:15,660
If you were at our previous Detroit show,

60
00:03:15,660 --> 00:03:20,660
I would like you to please stand and be recognized

61
00:03:20,660 --> 00:03:22,660
for your valor.

62
00:03:22,660 --> 00:03:26,660
You have all given so much for your country.

63
00:03:26,660 --> 00:03:28,660
This day of all days is important.

64
00:03:28,660 --> 00:03:30,660
Wait, is there lightsabers?

65
00:03:30,660 --> 00:03:33,660
Thank you, some lightsabers.

66
00:03:33,660 --> 00:03:35,660
People repping the Star Wars show.

67
00:03:35,660 --> 00:03:36,660
Bold.

68
00:03:36,660 --> 00:03:37,660
Bold.

69
00:03:37,660 --> 00:03:40,660
Okay, make them go away.

70
00:03:40,660 --> 00:03:41,660
We were talking.

71
00:03:41,660 --> 00:03:42,660
Bye.

72
00:03:42,660 --> 00:03:43,660
We were talking.

73
00:03:43,660 --> 00:03:44,660
Too scary.

74
00:03:44,660 --> 00:03:45,660
Keep going.

75
00:03:45,660 --> 00:03:46,660
No, no, no.

76
00:03:46,660 --> 00:03:47,660
Yeah.

77
00:03:47,660 --> 00:03:48,660
Yeah.

78
00:03:48,660 --> 00:03:50,660
See, we can send jokes out of the room for a second.

79
00:03:50,660 --> 00:03:52,660
This is about the same number we had at that show.

80
00:03:52,660 --> 00:03:56,660
I do think we have, I mean, I think you can say safely this way,

81
00:03:56,660 --> 00:04:00,660
we have demonstrably reduced our audience draw

82
00:04:00,660 --> 00:04:02,660
in the city of Detroit, Michigan.

83
00:04:02,660 --> 00:04:04,660
Oh, honey, they're coming again.

84
00:04:04,660 --> 00:04:05,660
Are we going to go see that show?

85
00:04:05,660 --> 00:04:07,660
Oh, yeah.

86
00:04:07,660 --> 00:04:13,660
Probably talk about Babylon 5 or some nerd shit, babe.

87
00:04:13,660 --> 00:04:15,660
And so perhaps never more applicable than it is now,

88
00:04:15,660 --> 00:04:21,660
like the Chilean miners, we've reemerged from that disaster

89
00:04:21,660 --> 00:04:23,660
to be here with you.

90
00:04:23,660 --> 00:04:24,660
Oh, maybe you're...

91
00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:25,660
I still think of that as a good day

92
00:04:25,660 --> 00:04:27,660
because I saw Endgame afterwards.

93
00:04:27,660 --> 00:04:28,660
Yeah.

94
00:04:28,660 --> 00:04:29,660
Or no, Infinity War.

95
00:04:29,660 --> 00:04:30,660
Infinity War.

96
00:04:30,660 --> 00:04:31,660
Yeah.

97
00:04:31,660 --> 00:04:33,660
No, I saw Endgame after eating too much

98
00:04:33,660 --> 00:04:35,660
at a Brazilian steakhouse.

99
00:04:35,660 --> 00:04:36,660
Okay.

100
00:04:36,660 --> 00:04:39,660
That's how I'll always remember it.

101
00:04:39,660 --> 00:04:40,660
What do you think of Endgame?

102
00:04:40,660 --> 00:04:42,660
Too full.

103
00:04:42,660 --> 00:04:44,660
If you're a new fan of ours,

104
00:04:44,660 --> 00:04:46,660
and maybe you don't know what we're talking about

105
00:04:46,660 --> 00:04:47,660
with all this Star Wars stuff,

106
00:04:47,660 --> 00:04:49,660
one time we came to Detroit to do a Star Wars show

107
00:04:49,660 --> 00:04:52,660
and it kicked so much ass.

108
00:04:52,660 --> 00:04:54,660
It was such a kickass show.

109
00:04:54,660 --> 00:04:56,660
We definitely didn't bail out super quick on the bit.

110
00:04:56,660 --> 00:04:57,660
Yeah.

111
00:04:57,660 --> 00:04:58,660
Yeah.

112
00:04:58,660 --> 00:04:59,660
Definitely one of us didn't bail out instantly

113
00:04:59,660 --> 00:05:02,660
for which the other two of us were actually pretty angry

114
00:05:02,660 --> 00:05:04,660
the next day.

115
00:05:04,660 --> 00:05:05,660
Travis.

116
00:05:05,660 --> 00:05:06,660
No, what?

117
00:05:06,660 --> 00:05:07,660
What?

118
00:05:07,660 --> 00:05:09,660
Yes, because I'm the one known for bailing

119
00:05:09,660 --> 00:05:10,660
on a not funny thing.

120
00:05:10,660 --> 00:05:12,660
It's been lost to history.

121
00:05:12,660 --> 00:05:13,660
We published that episode.

122
00:05:13,660 --> 00:05:16,660
Sorry, was my propensity for not doing things

123
00:05:16,660 --> 00:05:19,660
that aren't funny just used against me as a criticism?

124
00:05:19,660 --> 00:05:22,660
Justin, it was your original idea.

125
00:05:22,660 --> 00:05:24,660
It was your fucking idea, dude.

126
00:05:24,660 --> 00:05:26,660
You tweeted it without consulting anyone.

127
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:28,660
Okay.

128
00:05:28,660 --> 00:05:30,660
What I'm saying is if the richest man in the world

129
00:05:30,660 --> 00:05:32,660
can do a dumb thing that he doesn't think through,

130
00:05:32,660 --> 00:05:34,660
I should be allowed to do it too, right?

131
00:05:34,660 --> 00:05:35,660
Thank you.

132
00:05:35,660 --> 00:05:38,660
Otherwise, it's classist.

133
00:05:38,660 --> 00:05:41,660
It's rich dad, poor dad, podcaster.

134
00:05:41,660 --> 00:05:43,660
You gotta have the mentality.

135
00:05:43,660 --> 00:05:45,660
We were talking about this backstage

136
00:05:45,660 --> 00:05:47,660
because that was also the first tour

137
00:05:47,660 --> 00:05:49,660
that our business manager, Amanda,

138
00:05:49,660 --> 00:05:52,660
who is really the backbone of this organization,

139
00:05:52,660 --> 00:05:54,660
went on with us, and so we were like,

140
00:05:54,660 --> 00:05:56,660
hey, welcome to the company.

141
00:05:56,660 --> 00:05:57,660
We blew it.

142
00:05:57,660 --> 00:06:00,660
We fucked up so bad.

143
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:02,660
And we were talking about the next morning

144
00:06:02,660 --> 00:06:04,660
on our way to the airport, we took a Lyft,

145
00:06:04,660 --> 00:06:07,660
and it was like a sedan.

146
00:06:07,660 --> 00:06:10,660
So it was like driver, Amanda, all three of us together

147
00:06:10,660 --> 00:06:12,660
like we were on a road trip with our parents.

148
00:06:12,660 --> 00:06:14,660
What the fuck was wrong with you last night?

149
00:06:14,660 --> 00:06:16,660
What was that?

150
00:06:16,660 --> 00:06:18,660
And after that show,

151
00:06:18,660 --> 00:06:20,660
we changed the way we did live shows forever.

152
00:06:20,660 --> 00:06:22,660
We changed the format.

153
00:06:22,660 --> 00:06:23,660
No more themes.

154
00:06:23,660 --> 00:06:25,660
You know, we're having fun now,

155
00:06:25,660 --> 00:06:27,660
but I do not wish on any of you

156
00:06:27,660 --> 00:06:30,660
the feeling of sitting in front of 2,000 friends

157
00:06:30,660 --> 00:06:33,660
and realize you're dying.

158
00:06:33,660 --> 00:06:36,660
You're dying, and there's no force on earth

159
00:06:36,660 --> 00:06:38,660
that is gonna make that timer go any quicker.

160
00:06:38,660 --> 00:06:43,660
Not even the force, as it turns out.

161
00:06:43,660 --> 00:06:46,660
I do, now that it's been four years,

162
00:06:46,660 --> 00:06:50,660
I do just want to apologize to the people who were there.

163
00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:52,660
You did not get a good show, but...

164
00:06:52,660 --> 00:06:53,660
You got a great show.

165
00:06:53,660 --> 00:06:54,660
You got a weird show.

166
00:06:54,660 --> 00:06:56,660
For everyone else on the planet,

167
00:06:56,660 --> 00:06:59,660
it's funny that that show happened to you.

168
00:06:59,660 --> 00:07:03,660
But that show happened a long time ago

169
00:07:03,660 --> 00:07:06,660
in a theater that was here, so that part doesn't work.

170
00:07:06,660 --> 00:07:07,660
But we've grown.

171
00:07:07,660 --> 00:07:08,660
We've grown.

172
00:07:08,660 --> 00:07:12,660
Except in terms, again, as Justin demonstrably stated earlier,

173
00:07:12,660 --> 00:07:14,660
of audience following.

174
00:07:14,660 --> 00:07:18,660
Ability to sell tickets here in Detroit.

175
00:07:18,660 --> 00:07:20,660
Don't look at the balcony.

176
00:07:20,660 --> 00:07:22,660
Let's go. Let's do the damn thing.

177
00:07:22,660 --> 00:07:24,660
Oh, yeah, so we actually decided

178
00:07:24,660 --> 00:07:27,660
to do the best show we've ever done to make up for it.

179
00:07:31,660 --> 00:07:33,660
And that's the power of marketing.

180
00:07:33,660 --> 00:07:35,660
How do I stop my coworker from...

181
00:07:35,660 --> 00:07:36,660
Oh, it's also not too late.

182
00:07:36,660 --> 00:07:38,660
If you have friends in the area who aren't here...

183
00:07:38,660 --> 00:07:39,660
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

184
00:07:39,660 --> 00:07:40,660
We'll keep the doors open.

185
00:07:40,660 --> 00:07:42,660
We'll cut them a good discount.

186
00:07:42,660 --> 00:07:43,660
You say, you ever seen...

187
00:07:43,660 --> 00:07:44,660
No, okay, yeah, Amanda says no.

188
00:07:44,660 --> 00:07:46,660
No discount, but they are welcome.

189
00:07:46,660 --> 00:07:48,660
Say, you ever seen a comedy podcast show

190
00:07:48,660 --> 00:07:51,660
from up higher in the theater?

191
00:07:51,660 --> 00:07:53,660
And farther back?

192
00:07:53,660 --> 00:07:55,660
It's just three guys at a table,

193
00:07:55,660 --> 00:07:57,660
so you'll have to squint to see them,

194
00:07:57,660 --> 00:07:58,660
but you'll love it.

195
00:07:58,660 --> 00:08:00,660
How do I stop my coworker

196
00:08:00,660 --> 00:08:03,660
from using the communal kettle to make hard-boiled eggs?

197
00:08:05,660 --> 00:08:08,660
I'm not a person to keep someone from enjoying a breakfast meal,

198
00:08:08,660 --> 00:08:11,660
but I use that same kettle she boils eggs in to make my tea.

199
00:08:11,660 --> 00:08:14,660
That's from Agoraphobic in Ontario.

200
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:16,660
Welcome to America.

201
00:08:16,660 --> 00:08:18,660
That question is weird enough

202
00:08:18,660 --> 00:08:21,660
that I don't know what parts are Canada weird

203
00:08:21,660 --> 00:08:23,660
and which parts are America weird.

204
00:08:23,660 --> 00:08:26,660
There might be some parts that are Canada normal in there,

205
00:08:26,660 --> 00:08:28,660
like making eggs at work.

206
00:08:28,660 --> 00:08:30,660
Is it the communal kettle that's the problem?

207
00:08:30,660 --> 00:08:34,660
I think just to sort of skirt this whole thing in the future,

208
00:08:34,660 --> 00:08:38,660
it's illegal to bring ingredients to work.

209
00:08:40,660 --> 00:08:41,660
Yeah.

210
00:08:41,660 --> 00:08:44,660
Gone food and cold food are the only two.

211
00:08:44,660 --> 00:08:48,660
The time you spend poaching an egg in the cafeteria

212
00:08:48,660 --> 00:08:50,660
is time theft, I believe.

213
00:08:50,660 --> 00:08:51,660
Right.

214
00:08:51,660 --> 00:08:53,660
You are cooking now.

215
00:08:53,660 --> 00:08:55,660
I just also want to say,

216
00:08:55,660 --> 00:08:57,660
what type of person is the type of person

217
00:08:57,660 --> 00:08:59,660
to stop someone from enjoying breakfast food?

218
00:08:59,660 --> 00:09:02,660
That seems like a very specific thing that someone's into,

219
00:09:02,660 --> 00:09:05,660
like, it depends on what kind of burrito it is.

220
00:09:07,660 --> 00:09:10,660
The thing that really upsets me the most about this question

221
00:09:10,660 --> 00:09:12,660
is that they're better cold.

222
00:09:12,660 --> 00:09:13,660
Hard-boiled eggs?

223
00:09:13,660 --> 00:09:14,660
Oh, yeah.

224
00:09:14,660 --> 00:09:15,660
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

225
00:09:15,660 --> 00:09:17,660
Why is this person not making them at home?

226
00:09:17,660 --> 00:09:18,660
It's so easy.

227
00:09:18,660 --> 00:09:20,660
Oh, they make them for the next day.

228
00:09:20,660 --> 00:09:22,660
Oh, I'm going to be enjoying these come lunchtime.

229
00:09:22,660 --> 00:09:24,660
You wait.

230
00:09:24,660 --> 00:09:27,660
That's really where the friction's coming from.

231
00:09:27,660 --> 00:09:29,660
It's that they can never make tea

232
00:09:29,660 --> 00:09:32,660
because those eggs are always in there.

233
00:09:32,660 --> 00:09:35,660
I like to make 45-minute eggs.

234
00:09:35,660 --> 00:09:36,660
Why would you bring...

235
00:09:36,660 --> 00:09:39,660
We've agreed that there should be no ingredients at work.

236
00:09:39,660 --> 00:09:40,660
Why would you bring an ingredient

237
00:09:40,660 --> 00:09:42,660
where there's a high likelihood you get to work

238
00:09:42,660 --> 00:09:43,660
and make the noise,

239
00:09:43,660 --> 00:09:45,660
oh, man.

240
00:09:45,660 --> 00:09:48,660
Oh, no, all the eggs, man.

241
00:09:48,660 --> 00:09:49,660
Okay, wait.

242
00:09:49,660 --> 00:09:51,660
Justin and Griffin, which one's weirder?

243
00:09:51,660 --> 00:09:53,660
Bringing a whole carton of eggs

244
00:09:53,660 --> 00:09:56,660
or bringing just enough to eat that day?

245
00:09:56,660 --> 00:09:58,660
A whole carton of eggs.

246
00:09:58,660 --> 00:09:59,660
That's so many eggs.

247
00:09:59,660 --> 00:10:01,660
Okay, but you're thinking about it, right?

248
00:10:01,660 --> 00:10:02,660
Yeah, I am thinking about it

249
00:10:02,660 --> 00:10:04,660
because if I'm going to make all hard-boiled eggs,

250
00:10:04,660 --> 00:10:05,660
I'm going to make six.

251
00:10:05,660 --> 00:10:06,660
I love those guys.

252
00:10:06,660 --> 00:10:09,660
Right, so the idea of I brought a raw...

253
00:10:09,660 --> 00:10:10,660
Yeah, a raw egg.

254
00:10:10,660 --> 00:10:11,660
Oh, this?

255
00:10:11,660 --> 00:10:13,660
I'm either going to eat it for lunch

256
00:10:13,660 --> 00:10:15,660
or see if I can build a parachute

257
00:10:15,660 --> 00:10:17,660
that will safely land it from a second story.

258
00:10:17,660 --> 00:10:19,660
I'm going to eat it for lunch

259
00:10:19,660 --> 00:10:20,660
or keep it alive for a week

260
00:10:20,660 --> 00:10:22,660
to teach you about being a parent.

261
00:10:22,660 --> 00:10:24,660
Because it's basically one and one.

262
00:10:24,660 --> 00:10:26,660
Take it from three parents, babies, eggs, same.

263
00:10:26,660 --> 00:10:31,660
Yeah, as long as you're not dropping babies are fine.

264
00:10:31,660 --> 00:10:33,660
I would actually, in many ways,

265
00:10:33,660 --> 00:10:34,660
rather drop a baby, but...

266
00:10:34,660 --> 00:10:36,660
The egg, that's interesting.

267
00:10:36,660 --> 00:10:39,660
Huh, we don't need to go into it.

268
00:10:39,660 --> 00:10:43,660
I don't understand how they're getting the eggs to work.

269
00:10:43,660 --> 00:10:45,660
That's all I can think about.

270
00:10:45,660 --> 00:10:46,660
It's got to be hand.

271
00:10:46,660 --> 00:10:50,660
It's got to be one egg and a hand.

272
00:10:50,660 --> 00:10:51,660
I don't know, I trust...

273
00:10:51,660 --> 00:10:56,660
If I can't see egg, it has squished already.

274
00:10:56,660 --> 00:10:58,660
I think that this is the point

275
00:10:58,660 --> 00:11:00,660
where you can go to the boss of this company and say,

276
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:02,660
hey, I think you're requiring this person

277
00:11:02,660 --> 00:11:03,660
to get to work too early.

278
00:11:03,660 --> 00:11:06,660
They don't have time to boil an egg in the morning.

279
00:11:06,660 --> 00:11:09,660
Because if it's breakfast food, then it's like,

280
00:11:09,660 --> 00:11:11,660
get to work, first thing you do,

281
00:11:11,660 --> 00:11:13,660
pop on the kettle and boil an egg.

282
00:11:13,660 --> 00:11:16,660
I want to talk more about means of egg conveyance.

283
00:11:16,660 --> 00:11:19,660
And the armpit is the safest and it might hatch.

284
00:11:19,660 --> 00:11:22,660
I would say maybe they're door dashing it.

285
00:11:22,660 --> 00:11:24,660
I don't know if they got that Canada.

286
00:11:24,660 --> 00:11:26,660
It's where they bring you things.

287
00:11:26,660 --> 00:11:27,660
Like an egg?

288
00:11:27,660 --> 00:11:28,660
Like one egg?

289
00:11:28,660 --> 00:11:31,660
No, they get them door dashed every week

290
00:11:31,660 --> 00:11:33,660
and the guy's like, ah, floor 12.

291
00:11:33,660 --> 00:11:35,660
Yeah, send me on up, I got the eggs.

292
00:11:35,660 --> 00:11:38,660
Hi Valerie, I'm here with your weekly eggs.

293
00:11:38,660 --> 00:11:41,660
Man, I'd love a hard boiled egg right now.

294
00:11:41,660 --> 00:11:45,660
If I've ever seen an example of why HR exists,

295
00:11:45,660 --> 00:11:46,660
it is that.

296
00:11:46,660 --> 00:11:49,660
I'm just like, hey, I don't mean to be a pain,

297
00:11:49,660 --> 00:11:53,660
but Debbie is boiling eggs in the teapot.

298
00:11:53,660 --> 00:11:55,660
I go, yeah, that's an easy fix.

299
00:11:55,660 --> 00:11:57,660
I'll take care of this.

300
00:11:57,660 --> 00:11:58,660
This one's fixable.

301
00:11:58,660 --> 00:11:59,660
This one's easy.

302
00:11:59,660 --> 00:12:02,660
There are some way more complex things we've had to deal with.

303
00:12:02,660 --> 00:12:05,660
Don't boil eggs in the teapot.

304
00:12:05,660 --> 00:12:06,660
I've got this one.

305
00:12:06,660 --> 00:12:10,660
Hey, next white elephant gift exchange you do,

306
00:12:10,660 --> 00:12:12,660
just throw a teapot in the mix.

307
00:12:12,660 --> 00:12:16,660
It will solve the problem no matter who it ends up with.

308
00:12:16,660 --> 00:12:19,660
Ideally, it ends up with the egg pervert

309
00:12:19,660 --> 00:12:23,660
and then they can do their stuff at home.

310
00:12:23,660 --> 00:12:24,660
Maybe that's it.

311
00:12:24,660 --> 00:12:25,660
They're embarrassed.

312
00:12:25,660 --> 00:12:27,660
They don't know where to buy it.

313
00:12:27,660 --> 00:12:29,660
How does the water get this hot at work?

314
00:12:29,660 --> 00:12:31,660
Jesus Christ.

315
00:12:31,660 --> 00:12:36,660
Anybody notice the water gets so much hotter here at work?

316
00:12:36,660 --> 00:12:38,660
It makes bubbles like there's a little guy under there

317
00:12:38,660 --> 00:12:39,660
blowing water.

318
00:12:39,660 --> 00:12:40,660
This is weird.

319
00:12:40,660 --> 00:12:41,660
Guys, guys, check this out.

320
00:12:41,660 --> 00:12:42,660
I put a raw egg in.

321
00:12:42,660 --> 00:12:43,660
Well, watch this.

322
00:12:43,660 --> 00:12:44,660
Peel it.

323
00:12:44,660 --> 00:12:46,660
It does a goosh everywhere.

324
00:12:46,660 --> 00:12:48,660
Not goosh, not chicken, hard.

325
00:12:48,660 --> 00:12:50,660
What?

326
00:12:50,660 --> 00:12:54,660
This only happens at work.

327
00:12:54,660 --> 00:12:57,660
Call the science guy person.

328
00:12:57,660 --> 00:13:01,660
You know, whatever the Canadian version of Bill Nye is.

329
00:13:01,660 --> 00:13:03,660
That brief pause was all three of us

330
00:13:03,660 --> 00:13:05,660
trying to think of a funny version,

331
00:13:05,660 --> 00:13:08,660
Canadian version of Bill Nye coming up with Zilcho

332
00:13:08,660 --> 00:13:09,660
and moving on.

333
00:13:09,660 --> 00:13:11,660
William Nye was the best I had, and that wasn't it.

334
00:13:11,660 --> 00:13:12,660
That's nothing.

335
00:13:12,660 --> 00:13:13,660
I know.

336
00:13:13,660 --> 00:13:14,660
I'm glad you didn't say that out loud.

337
00:13:14,660 --> 00:13:18,660
So let's raise, we're going to raise the cultural bar

338
00:13:18,660 --> 00:13:20,660
a little bit here in Detroit, home of culture.

339
00:13:20,660 --> 00:13:22,660
Fancy is taking flight.

340
00:13:22,660 --> 00:13:24,660
And I thought that maybe we would make things

341
00:13:24,660 --> 00:13:27,660
just a little more adult

342
00:13:27,660 --> 00:13:30,660
and discuss some works of fart.

343
00:13:30,660 --> 00:13:38,660
I hate the stinger.

344
00:13:38,660 --> 00:13:42,660
I hate the stinger for this bit so bad.

345
00:13:42,660 --> 00:13:43,660
Griffin, this is tour manager Paul.

346
00:13:43,660 --> 00:13:44,660
So if you've never heard...

347
00:13:44,660 --> 00:13:45,660
Hold on, wait, Travis.

348
00:13:45,660 --> 00:13:48,660
I've got some alts on that opening if you'd like.

349
00:13:48,660 --> 00:13:49,660
Oh, okay.

350
00:13:49,660 --> 00:13:50,660
Yeah, if you don't mind,

351
00:13:50,660 --> 00:13:53,660
if you have one that the bit rate on the fart MP3

352
00:13:53,660 --> 00:13:54,660
is not like...

353
00:13:54,660 --> 00:13:57,660
I don't think it was loud enough for these riffs to land,

354
00:13:57,660 --> 00:13:58,660
so I'd love to hear it cranked again.

355
00:13:58,660 --> 00:13:59,660
Yeah, yeah.

356
00:13:59,660 --> 00:14:00,660
Everyone, listen.

357
00:14:00,660 --> 00:14:01,660
All right.

358
00:14:01,660 --> 00:14:02,660
This is my first new one,

359
00:14:02,660 --> 00:14:08,660
which is actually the one I just played.

360
00:14:08,660 --> 00:14:11,660
That sucks, Paul.

361
00:14:11,660 --> 00:14:14,660
Paul, that sounds so bad, my man.

362
00:14:14,660 --> 00:14:15,660
I love it.

363
00:14:15,660 --> 00:14:18,660
Paul, you do make music.

364
00:14:18,660 --> 00:14:20,660
So you know what it sounds like

365
00:14:20,660 --> 00:14:21,660
when a sound is pleasing to the ears.

366
00:14:21,660 --> 00:14:23,660
I don't know, if Paul wrote the music part,

367
00:14:23,660 --> 00:14:24,660
that was pretty good.

368
00:14:24,660 --> 00:14:25,660
Yeah, the music part was great.

369
00:14:25,660 --> 00:14:27,660
Do you have any with a fart that doesn't sound like

370
00:14:27,660 --> 00:14:31,660
it is coming through a payphone pulse, Warren?

371
00:14:31,660 --> 00:14:33,660
That was a high quality...

372
00:14:33,660 --> 00:14:35,660
Okay, wait.

373
00:14:35,660 --> 00:14:38,660
I want fully lossless audio codec, please, Paul.

374
00:14:38,660 --> 00:14:40,660
I need a quick pull to my ears.

375
00:14:40,660 --> 00:14:42,660
That was a pretty high quality fart.

376
00:14:42,660 --> 00:14:44,660
Are you fucking out of your mind?

377
00:14:44,660 --> 00:14:45,660
You.

378
00:14:45,660 --> 00:14:46,660
It seems you.

379
00:14:46,660 --> 00:14:47,660
Oh, beyond.

380
00:14:47,660 --> 00:14:48,660
Do you need comparison?

381
00:14:48,660 --> 00:14:51,660
Here's the original cue that you use for always...

382
00:14:51,660 --> 00:14:52,660
Don't play more of...

383
00:14:52,660 --> 00:14:59,660
Original cue.

384
00:14:59,660 --> 00:15:00,660
That's such fucking...

385
00:15:00,660 --> 00:15:05,660
That is a JPEG of a fart.

386
00:15:05,660 --> 00:15:07,660
All right, here's another alt.

387
00:15:07,660 --> 00:15:08,660
Paul!

388
00:15:08,660 --> 00:15:09,660
Try this one.

389
00:15:09,660 --> 00:15:14,660
Third option, hold on.

390
00:15:14,660 --> 00:15:22,660
Don't fucking clap for that.

391
00:15:22,660 --> 00:15:23,660
This is what...

392
00:15:23,660 --> 00:15:26,660
You guys deserve the fucking Star Wars show

393
00:15:26,660 --> 00:15:30,660
if this is what you like.

394
00:15:30,660 --> 00:15:37,660
The amount of hiss on the high end of that fart sound

395
00:15:37,660 --> 00:15:39,660
sucks so bad, Paul.

396
00:15:39,660 --> 00:15:44,660
And what drives me crazy is I know you know that.

397
00:15:44,660 --> 00:15:45,660
I got one more.

398
00:15:45,660 --> 00:15:46,660
Paul, don't!

399
00:15:46,660 --> 00:15:47,660
Okay, wait.

400
00:15:47,660 --> 00:15:53,660
One more, one more, one more.

401
00:15:53,660 --> 00:15:55,660
Fart.

402
00:15:55,660 --> 00:15:57,660
I honestly prefer it.

403
00:15:57,660 --> 00:15:59,660
All right, here we go.

404
00:15:59,660 --> 00:16:03,660
The way this works, I am going to describe the thing.

405
00:16:03,660 --> 00:16:06,660
This is a dumb fucking podcast.

406
00:16:06,660 --> 00:16:07,660
Go ahead.

407
00:16:07,660 --> 00:16:09,660
And then Griffin and Justin are going to guess what it is.

408
00:16:09,660 --> 00:16:11,660
So it might be a movie, might be a book.

409
00:16:11,660 --> 00:16:13,660
I forgot we were doing work of fart for a second.

410
00:16:13,660 --> 00:16:15,660
I was having a lot of fun with Paul over there.

411
00:16:15,660 --> 00:16:19,660
And so I was like embarrassed that we played the fart sound so many times.

412
00:16:19,660 --> 00:16:21,660
And then I was like, oh, good, that part's over.

413
00:16:21,660 --> 00:16:24,660
And now we can get to work of fart.

414
00:16:24,660 --> 00:16:29,660
A governess helps a single father raise his numerous children

415
00:16:29,660 --> 00:16:33,660
by teaching them to harmonize their farts.

416
00:16:33,660 --> 00:16:35,660
The sound of...

417
00:16:35,660 --> 00:16:36,660
Sound of Pusick.

418
00:16:36,660 --> 00:16:40,660
Yes, Justin gets it.

419
00:16:40,660 --> 00:16:42,660
That's one point for Justin.

420
00:16:42,660 --> 00:16:45,660
I was going to say the sound of Pusick, but that's not it, is it?

421
00:16:45,660 --> 00:16:46,660
That's not it.

422
00:16:46,660 --> 00:16:47,660
I'm slipping.

423
00:16:47,660 --> 00:16:53,660
This Joseph Heller novel examines the absurdity of war in military life

424
00:16:53,660 --> 00:16:57,660
while extolling the virtues of mutual pleasure.

425
00:16:57,660 --> 00:16:58,660
Fucking...

426
00:16:58,660 --> 00:17:04,660
Can you give me a hint of who the fuck that is?

427
00:17:04,660 --> 00:17:06,660
Okay, can you read it one more time?

428
00:17:06,660 --> 00:17:12,660
This Joseph Heller novel examines the absurdity of war in military life

429
00:17:12,660 --> 00:17:16,660
while extolling the virtues of mutual pleasure.

430
00:17:16,660 --> 00:17:18,660
Catch 20...

431
00:17:18,660 --> 00:17:21,660
Catch 20 Goo?

432
00:17:21,660 --> 00:17:22,660
What?

433
00:17:22,660 --> 00:17:23,660
Catch 20 Goo?

434
00:17:23,660 --> 00:17:26,660
Listen, mutual pleasure.

435
00:17:26,660 --> 00:17:27,660
Catch 69.

436
00:17:27,660 --> 00:17:29,660
Yes, it's Catch 69.

437
00:17:29,660 --> 00:17:32,660
No, no, no, someone in the audience said it.

438
00:17:32,660 --> 00:17:33,660
That's no points.

439
00:17:33,660 --> 00:17:34,660
Justin's still up.

440
00:17:34,660 --> 00:17:35,660
Okay, thank you.

441
00:17:35,660 --> 00:17:36,660
Okay.

442
00:17:36,660 --> 00:17:41,660
This 70s rock album was recorded in the aftermath of relationship breakups

443
00:17:41,660 --> 00:17:45,660
among the band's members and heavy bathrooming,

444
00:17:45,660 --> 00:17:48,660
both of which shaped the album's lyrics.

445
00:17:48,660 --> 00:17:49,660
Poomers?

446
00:17:49,660 --> 00:17:51,660
Poomers, yes, Justin.

447
00:17:51,660 --> 00:17:55,660
You're getting a little predictable in your twilight years.

448
00:17:55,660 --> 00:17:57,660
All right, all right, all right.

449
00:17:57,660 --> 00:17:59,660
Oh, rumors, this is all rumors.

450
00:17:59,660 --> 00:18:00,660
Okay, okay.

451
00:18:00,660 --> 00:18:04,660
Perhaps Tolstoy's greatest work.

452
00:18:04,660 --> 00:18:08,660
This novel focuses on Napoleon's Russian invasion

453
00:18:08,660 --> 00:18:11,660
and features three main characters who pee on everything.

454
00:18:11,660 --> 00:18:13,660
Warren Peas?

455
00:18:13,660 --> 00:18:14,660
Close.

456
00:18:14,660 --> 00:18:15,660
Warren Piss?

457
00:18:15,660 --> 00:18:19,660
Warren Piss, yes, that is correct, Griffin.

458
00:18:19,660 --> 00:18:22,660
Okay, it's down to the wire, it's two and two.

459
00:18:22,660 --> 00:18:27,660
Everybody scoot back, you're on the edge of your seats.

460
00:18:27,660 --> 00:18:33,660
This Joyce classic is the story of a day in the life of Leopold Bloom

461
00:18:33,660 --> 00:18:36,660
as he travels Dublin and goes about his business.

462
00:18:36,660 --> 00:18:38,660
Is it Pulisies?

463
00:18:38,660 --> 00:18:42,660
Yes.

464
00:18:42,660 --> 00:18:43,660
You didn't let me finish!

465
00:18:43,660 --> 00:18:44,660
I didn't even get a...

466
00:18:44,660 --> 00:18:45,660
Can I finish?

467
00:18:45,660 --> 00:18:46,660
Yeah, please.

468
00:18:46,660 --> 00:18:48,660
Just a lot of poo ones this time.

469
00:18:48,660 --> 00:18:50,660
As he travels Dublin and goes about his business,

470
00:18:50,660 --> 00:18:53,660
attending a funeral, buying soap, going to the library,

471
00:18:53,660 --> 00:18:55,660
walking by the beach, going to the pub,

472
00:18:55,660 --> 00:19:02,660
but mostly his six-hour epic long shitting session.

473
00:19:02,660 --> 00:19:03,660
Pulisies.

474
00:19:03,660 --> 00:19:05,660
Yes, Justin wins!

475
00:19:05,660 --> 00:19:06,660
Oh, that was it?

476
00:19:06,660 --> 00:19:10,660
Let's hear it for Justin.

477
00:19:10,660 --> 00:19:17,660
If it's gotten to the point where we can just take any media

478
00:19:17,660 --> 00:19:20,660
with a title that has the ooh sound in it.

479
00:19:20,660 --> 00:19:21,660
Yes.

480
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:22,660
Right, that is the point we're at

481
00:19:22,660 --> 00:19:23,660
and the point we've been at.

482
00:19:23,660 --> 00:19:24,660
Yes.

483
00:19:24,660 --> 00:19:25,660
Okay, cool.

484
00:19:25,660 --> 00:19:27,660
I'll remember that for next time.

485
00:19:27,660 --> 00:19:29,660
That's when I've got you.

486
00:19:29,660 --> 00:19:31,660
I work at a pizza place delivering said...

487
00:19:31,660 --> 00:19:33,660
No, you don't.

488
00:19:33,660 --> 00:19:34,660
Please go ahead, Justin.

489
00:19:34,660 --> 00:19:38,660
I work at a pizza place delivering said pizzas to people's homes.

490
00:19:38,660 --> 00:19:41,660
I also moved out on my own recently, so money's been tight.

491
00:19:41,660 --> 00:19:42,660
I make and deliver pizzas.

492
00:19:42,660 --> 00:19:43,660
Thank you for coming.

493
00:19:43,660 --> 00:19:44,660
I appreciate that.

494
00:19:44,660 --> 00:19:45,660
Thank you.

495
00:19:45,660 --> 00:19:48,660
I make and deliver dozens of orders a day.

496
00:19:48,660 --> 00:19:51,660
This is normally not a problem except for when I'm hungry.

497
00:19:51,660 --> 00:19:53,660
Then the hunger comes

498
00:19:53,660 --> 00:19:55,660
and I crave the greasy pie.

499
00:19:55,660 --> 00:19:59,660
Brothers, is there a way for me to get free pizza from my job

500
00:19:59,660 --> 00:20:02,660
without leaving my customers short of a slice?

501
00:20:02,660 --> 00:20:04,660
That's from delivering in Detroit.

502
00:20:04,660 --> 00:20:07,660
What I love about this is you phrased it in such a way,

503
00:20:07,660 --> 00:20:10,660
but what you're asking about is can I take a piece of pizza

504
00:20:10,660 --> 00:20:13,660
out of the box before I deliver it, right?

505
00:20:13,660 --> 00:20:16,660
Yeah, Trav, clearly that was the context of the question.

506
00:20:16,660 --> 00:20:19,660
Because you can get free food from a restaurant you work at.

507
00:20:19,660 --> 00:20:20,660
That happens all the time.

508
00:20:20,660 --> 00:20:23,660
You make the pizza wrong and then you get to eat it.

509
00:20:23,660 --> 00:20:25,660
That's the rules at pizza.

510
00:20:25,660 --> 00:20:27,660
But I don't think they want that.

511
00:20:27,660 --> 00:20:30,660
There's something about it that gets your motor running

512
00:20:30,660 --> 00:20:32,660
instead of eating somebody else's pizza.

513
00:20:32,660 --> 00:20:33,660
The illicit pie.

514
00:20:33,660 --> 00:20:35,660
The OPP, that's what it stands for.

515
00:20:35,660 --> 00:20:37,660
Oh, is that what it stands for?

516
00:20:37,660 --> 00:20:38,660
I've always wondered, yeah.

517
00:20:38,660 --> 00:20:40,660
The whole time, that's what it stood for.

518
00:20:40,660 --> 00:20:43,660
So here's my first pitch to you.

519
00:20:43,660 --> 00:20:45,660
Bring, bring, welcome to Pac-Man's Pizza,

520
00:20:45,660 --> 00:20:48,660
home of the famous Pac-Man pizza

521
00:20:48,660 --> 00:20:51,660
where every pizza looks like Pac-Man.

522
00:20:51,660 --> 00:20:54,660
Uh-huh, yeah, it's a promotion.

523
00:20:54,660 --> 00:20:55,660
Uh-huh, yeah.

524
00:20:55,660 --> 00:20:57,660
It's a promotion that we named our business after.

525
00:20:57,660 --> 00:20:59,660
It's a promotion that was so successful

526
00:20:59,660 --> 00:21:00,660
we named our business after it.

527
00:21:00,660 --> 00:21:03,660
Do you want, for the little dots,

528
00:21:03,660 --> 00:21:05,660
do you want red bites or pepperoni?

529
00:21:05,660 --> 00:21:06,660
Sorry.

530
00:21:06,660 --> 00:21:09,660
Waka, waka, waka, waka.

531
00:21:09,660 --> 00:21:10,660
Pac-a-roni.

532
00:21:10,660 --> 00:21:12,660
They make us call them Pac-a-roni,

533
00:21:12,660 --> 00:21:15,660
but that's confusing because it sounds like macaroni.

534
00:21:15,660 --> 00:21:17,660
Waka, waka, waka.

535
00:21:17,660 --> 00:21:19,660
Welcome to Elijah's Pizza

536
00:21:19,660 --> 00:21:21,660
where we leave a slice out for our boy.

537
00:21:24,660 --> 00:21:26,660
Just a big stack of them at the end of the day,

538
00:21:26,660 --> 00:21:29,660
but then when none of us are looking, they disappear.

539
00:21:29,660 --> 00:21:32,660
Elijah loves fucking pizza, man.

540
00:21:32,660 --> 00:21:33,660
Loves that stuff.

541
00:21:33,660 --> 00:21:35,660
Why don't you give them their total?

542
00:21:35,660 --> 00:21:37,660
You just say, and we have a way

543
00:21:37,660 --> 00:21:40,660
for your order to be one-eighth cheaper.

544
00:21:40,660 --> 00:21:43,660
Would you be interested in that promotion today?

545
00:21:43,660 --> 00:21:45,660
Would you be interested in built-in tip?

546
00:21:45,660 --> 00:21:49,660
Yes, welcome to Pac-Man's where you'd never have to tip

547
00:21:49,660 --> 00:21:52,660
because we already took it out of the box on our way over.

548
00:21:52,660 --> 00:21:57,660
I think there is a reality in which you could swing this

549
00:21:57,660 --> 00:22:00,660
just based on facial expression,

550
00:22:00,660 --> 00:22:05,660
based on just sort of like guilt, non-verbalized guilt.

551
00:22:05,660 --> 00:22:07,660
Just like, yeah, and here's your pizza, man.

552
00:22:07,660 --> 00:22:08,660
Oh, thank you. Thanks for the tip.

553
00:22:08,660 --> 00:22:11,660
Oh, that looks really good.

554
00:22:11,660 --> 00:22:12,660
Yeah, man.

555
00:22:12,660 --> 00:22:13,660
You guys are going to love that.

556
00:22:13,660 --> 00:22:16,660
It looks so gooey and delicious.

557
00:22:16,660 --> 00:22:17,660
I wish I had pizza.

558
00:22:17,660 --> 00:22:22,660
Damn, I wish I had just even a little bit of that pizza.

559
00:22:22,660 --> 00:22:24,660
Wouldn't it be dope if they made it

560
00:22:24,660 --> 00:22:28,660
so you could easily separate out a small little,

561
00:22:28,660 --> 00:22:32,660
like a segment of the, a piece of the pizza that I could have?

562
00:22:32,660 --> 00:22:34,660
Anyways, back to my car that smells like pizza

563
00:22:34,660 --> 00:22:36,660
but doesn't taste like it.

564
00:22:36,660 --> 00:22:39,660
Maybe you could try like, and whenever you're done,

565
00:22:39,660 --> 00:22:41,660
just leave whatever you don't want on the porch.

566
00:22:41,660 --> 00:22:43,660
I'll come back.

567
00:22:43,660 --> 00:22:48,660
That's the service we are at Raccoon's Pizza.

568
00:22:48,660 --> 00:22:51,660
We have these new Tupperware boxes, so it all keeps,

569
00:22:51,660 --> 00:22:53,660
and I'll just come get it from you, no problem.

570
00:22:53,660 --> 00:22:55,660
This is my number. Just text me when you're done.

571
00:22:55,660 --> 00:22:58,660
Also, if you have any batteries you need to dispose of,

572
00:22:58,660 --> 00:23:02,660
I'm happy to grab those too, as long as I'm here.

573
00:23:02,660 --> 00:23:05,660
Even if it's just a couple pepperoni stuck to the box, man.

574
00:23:05,660 --> 00:23:06,660
Just let me know.

575
00:23:06,660 --> 00:23:08,660
Yeah, also like old paint.

576
00:23:08,660 --> 00:23:09,660
I'll come get that.

577
00:23:09,660 --> 00:23:10,660
Anything you got, bud.

578
00:23:10,660 --> 00:23:11,660
Where are you needing me to get rid of?

579
00:23:11,660 --> 00:23:13,660
I'm trying to think.

580
00:23:13,660 --> 00:23:17,660
If you take a piece out, but then you get like a circle

581
00:23:17,660 --> 00:23:21,660
out of the very center of the remainder of the pizza,

582
00:23:21,660 --> 00:23:25,660
can you just squish it back together?

583
00:23:25,660 --> 00:23:26,660
I don't think so.

584
00:23:26,660 --> 00:23:27,660
No, you can't actually.

585
00:23:27,660 --> 00:23:28,660
No, not that way.

586
00:23:28,660 --> 00:23:29,660
Not that way.

587
00:23:29,660 --> 00:23:30,660
No, wait, you could do.

588
00:23:30,660 --> 00:23:32,660
You could take one piece out and make a cone.

589
00:23:32,660 --> 00:23:35,660
You could take one rectangular slice.

590
00:23:35,660 --> 00:23:36,660
Okay, wait.

591
00:23:36,660 --> 00:23:37,660
Okay, hold on.

592
00:23:37,660 --> 00:23:38,660
Try to push people into square cut pizza.

593
00:23:38,660 --> 00:23:40,660
When you square cut their pizza,

594
00:23:40,660 --> 00:23:43,660
take the column of squares from the center.

595
00:23:43,660 --> 00:23:44,660
Yes.

596
00:23:44,660 --> 00:23:52,660
And then smoosh the halves, the remaining halves back together.

597
00:23:52,660 --> 00:23:54,660
I've seen two shows.

598
00:23:54,660 --> 00:23:58,660
I saw the Star Wars one and the one where they were helpful.

599
00:23:58,660 --> 00:23:59,660
It's amazing.

600
00:23:59,660 --> 00:24:00,660
Those are the two I've seen.

601
00:24:00,660 --> 00:24:02,660
Maybe you could do pizza origami and be like,

602
00:24:02,660 --> 00:24:05,660
I can turn it into a beautiful fleur de lis.

603
00:24:05,660 --> 00:24:09,660
One slice's worth of pizza will have to hit the cutting room floor

604
00:24:09,660 --> 00:24:11,660
in order to make this complicated pattern happen.

605
00:24:11,660 --> 00:24:12,660
An artistic cut.

606
00:24:12,660 --> 00:24:13,660
Yeah.

607
00:24:13,660 --> 00:24:15,660
Or like a pizza like Tesseract, right?

608
00:24:15,660 --> 00:24:17,660
We all think of it in a circle.

609
00:24:17,660 --> 00:24:18,660
Sure, sure.

610
00:24:18,660 --> 00:24:20,660
But what if it was a series of triangles

611
00:24:20,660 --> 00:24:22,660
forming a non-geometric shape?

612
00:24:22,660 --> 00:24:25,660
That is what a Tesseract is for sure.

613
00:24:25,660 --> 00:24:28,660
It's even better to think from a wrinkle in time.

614
00:24:28,660 --> 00:24:29,660
It's both, yeah, for sure.

615
00:24:29,660 --> 00:24:30,660
You got it.

616
00:24:30,660 --> 00:24:34,660
Hey, could you take a slice and then fold the pizza in half?

617
00:24:34,660 --> 00:24:37,660
And try to insist it's a calzone

618
00:24:37,660 --> 00:24:39,660
and the missing slice is on the bottom.

619
00:24:39,660 --> 00:24:42,660
The missing slice is inside.

620
00:24:42,660 --> 00:24:44,660
Yeah, well, by the time they realize that you're gone,

621
00:24:44,660 --> 00:24:46,660
maybe they'll never...

622
00:24:46,660 --> 00:24:47,660
Well, that's the other thing.

623
00:24:47,660 --> 00:24:49,660
Rarely have I ever had a pizza delivered

624
00:24:49,660 --> 00:24:52,660
and I open it to check before they leave.

625
00:24:52,660 --> 00:24:57,660
Okay, but I do do that because my kids like cheese and no sauce.

626
00:24:57,660 --> 00:24:58,660
Yeah.

627
00:24:58,660 --> 00:25:01,660
And then Cooper likes sausage and no cheese.

628
00:25:01,660 --> 00:25:03,660
So I do have to look at them

629
00:25:03,660 --> 00:25:06,660
because everyone assumes we're kidding.

630
00:25:06,660 --> 00:25:08,660
No, they didn't mean it.

631
00:25:08,660 --> 00:25:09,660
They didn't mean that.

632
00:25:09,660 --> 00:25:11,660
Can you deliver the pizza,

633
00:25:11,660 --> 00:25:14,660
take three pieces in the other direction,

634
00:25:14,660 --> 00:25:15,660
and then turn around and be like,

635
00:25:15,660 --> 00:25:18,660
my lord, wait, let me test the pizza.

636
00:25:18,660 --> 00:25:20,660
There have been assassins.

637
00:25:20,660 --> 00:25:23,660
The Assassin's Guild has been active lately, my liege.

638
00:25:23,660 --> 00:25:24,660
No, not the anchovy.

639
00:25:24,660 --> 00:25:26,660
Those are usually safe.

640
00:25:26,660 --> 00:25:28,660
I want the good one.

641
00:25:28,660 --> 00:25:32,660
Let me lay down mine life for you, my liege.

642
00:25:32,660 --> 00:25:35,660
I would love you to just start trying.

643
00:25:35,660 --> 00:25:37,660
When you drop the pizza off, just be like,

644
00:25:37,660 --> 00:25:39,660
can I get a slice?

645
00:25:39,660 --> 00:25:40,660
Yeah.

646
00:25:40,660 --> 00:25:41,660
Hey, man.

647
00:25:41,660 --> 00:25:42,660
I notice you open the door.

648
00:25:42,660 --> 00:25:43,660
I look inside.

649
00:25:43,660 --> 00:25:45,660
There's one chair face of the TV.

650
00:25:45,660 --> 00:25:46,660
You're not going to finish this whole thing.

651
00:25:46,660 --> 00:25:47,660
Let me get a slice.

652
00:25:47,660 --> 00:25:48,660
I'm not going to come in or make it weird.

653
00:25:48,660 --> 00:25:49,660
Just let me get a slice.

654
00:25:49,660 --> 00:25:51,660
Any pizza you've ever gotten that would've worked on you.

655
00:25:51,660 --> 00:25:52,660
Correct?

656
00:25:52,660 --> 00:25:54,660
100% of the time, I'd be like, absolutely, get in there.

657
00:25:54,660 --> 00:25:55,660
No, hold on.

658
00:25:55,660 --> 00:25:56,660
Logically, yes, Justin.

659
00:25:56,660 --> 00:25:57,660
Get in there.

660
00:25:57,660 --> 00:25:58,660
Emotionally, no.

661
00:25:58,660 --> 00:25:59,660
No.

662
00:25:59,660 --> 00:26:00,660
Someone brings you a pizza and goes,

663
00:26:00,660 --> 00:26:02,660
hold on, let me get a slice.

664
00:26:02,660 --> 00:26:03,660
No.

665
00:26:03,660 --> 00:26:04,660
I'd be like, I'm calling the police.

666
00:26:04,660 --> 00:26:05,660
It would be a request.

667
00:26:05,660 --> 00:26:06,660
It would be a request.

668
00:26:06,660 --> 00:26:08,660
Like, can I get a slice before I go?

669
00:26:08,660 --> 00:26:12,660
Rebrand the entire business like,

670
00:26:12,660 --> 00:26:15,660
Burgle Boys Pizza Factory.

671
00:26:15,660 --> 00:26:17,660
And the promotion can be,

672
00:26:17,660 --> 00:26:20,660
our pizza is so fucking delicious

673
00:26:20,660 --> 00:26:24,660
that our own delivery people will try to,

674
00:26:24,660 --> 00:26:26,660
sometimes our pizza is going to show up incomplete.

675
00:26:26,660 --> 00:26:28,660
It's because our pizza is so goddamn delicious.

676
00:26:28,660 --> 00:26:29,660
Let me throw this out.

677
00:26:29,660 --> 00:26:31,660
Pizza and pal.

678
00:26:31,660 --> 00:26:32,660
Where it's like, hey man,

679
00:26:32,660 --> 00:26:34,660
you feel like playing Mario Kart?

680
00:26:34,660 --> 00:26:35,660
Order a pizza.

681
00:26:35,660 --> 00:26:37,660
They'll show up, eat the pizza with you

682
00:26:37,660 --> 00:26:38,660
and play Mario Kart with you.

683
00:26:38,660 --> 00:26:39,660
Yes, I cannot stress enough

684
00:26:39,660 --> 00:26:42,660
how much there was a very narrow period of my life

685
00:26:42,660 --> 00:26:43,660
where I would've wanted this very badly.

686
00:26:43,660 --> 00:26:46,660
And then every other period of my life

687
00:26:46,660 --> 00:26:52,660
where I would very much not want this very, very badly.

688
00:26:52,660 --> 00:26:53,660
Give me a slice of pizza

689
00:26:53,660 --> 00:26:55,660
or I'm gonna play Mario Kart with you.

690
00:26:55,660 --> 00:26:57,660
Fucking, yeah, whatever you say, man.

691
00:26:57,660 --> 00:26:58,660
It's a sustainable model.

692
00:26:58,660 --> 00:27:01,660
It's just like weed delivery.

693
00:27:01,660 --> 00:27:06,660
My friends and family hate how I eat fruit.

694
00:27:06,660 --> 00:27:09,660
And here's our next question.

695
00:27:09,660 --> 00:27:12,660
Primarily, how I eat kiwis,

696
00:27:12,660 --> 00:27:13,660
like when we eat an apple.

697
00:27:13,660 --> 00:27:15,660
Skin and all.

698
00:27:15,660 --> 00:27:18,660
They also hate my, and now you're about to hate it,

699
00:27:18,660 --> 00:27:23,660
scrape and lick method of eating banana.

700
00:27:23,660 --> 00:27:26,660
I don't utilize either of those verbs

701
00:27:26,660 --> 00:27:29,660
when I eat a banana traditionally.

702
00:27:29,660 --> 00:27:32,660
It's where I scrape my top teeth along my banana

703
00:27:32,660 --> 00:27:37,660
to collect and enjoy the sweet aerated banana goo.

704
00:27:37,660 --> 00:27:41,660
Hey, you know, I just had a realization.

705
00:27:41,660 --> 00:27:44,660
There is at least one person in this room

706
00:27:44,660 --> 00:27:46,660
that can relate to what it feels like

707
00:27:46,660 --> 00:27:48,660
to fill in this room full of people

708
00:27:48,660 --> 00:27:50,660
that are disgusted by you.

709
00:27:50,660 --> 00:27:54,660
And I'm so happy we could share that feeling with you.

710
00:27:54,660 --> 00:27:56,660
How do I get them to see the right

711
00:27:56,660 --> 00:27:58,660
and proper way to eat fruit?

712
00:27:58,660 --> 00:28:00,660
That's from fruit muncher in Michigan.

713
00:28:00,660 --> 00:28:02,660
Okay, okay.

714
00:28:02,660 --> 00:28:06,660
Right and proper is a stretch.

715
00:28:06,660 --> 00:28:11,660
Justifiable fringe option is the best you might get.

716
00:28:11,660 --> 00:28:13,660
Hey, what's up?

717
00:28:13,660 --> 00:28:14,660
Oh, right, Griffin.

718
00:28:14,660 --> 00:28:16,660
Hey, I'm your friend.

719
00:28:16,660 --> 00:28:18,660
You can trust me.

720
00:28:18,660 --> 00:28:20,660
You came to my show.

721
00:28:20,660 --> 00:28:21,660
I'm Griffin McElroy.

722
00:28:21,660 --> 00:28:24,660
I'm your friend.

723
00:28:24,660 --> 00:28:27,660
You got to cut this shit out because...

724
00:28:27,660 --> 00:28:29,660
No, stop, hold on.

725
00:28:29,660 --> 00:28:33,660
Listen, listen, listen, listen, listen.

726
00:28:33,660 --> 00:28:41,660
You think, what's a few times eating a banana funny?

727
00:28:41,660 --> 00:28:43,660
This...

728
00:28:43,660 --> 00:28:50,660
I'm a complicated person with a lot of stuff going on.

729
00:28:50,660 --> 00:28:56,660
I'm a New York Times bestselling author and yet...

730
00:28:56,660 --> 00:29:03,660
Everyone knows me as the guy who ate a banana weird one time.

731
00:29:03,660 --> 00:29:05,660
You...

732
00:29:05,660 --> 00:29:06,660
It's...

733
00:29:06,660 --> 00:29:11,660
Listen, we didn't say your Christian name.

734
00:29:11,660 --> 00:29:13,660
It's not too late.

735
00:29:13,660 --> 00:29:15,660
We are...

736
00:29:15,660 --> 00:29:19,660
I am three ghosts of Christmas from different times.

737
00:29:19,660 --> 00:29:22,660
Stop it.

738
00:29:22,660 --> 00:29:24,660
This doesn't have to be you.

739
00:29:24,660 --> 00:29:29,660
There was a time to back Griffin up where you did this the first time.

740
00:29:29,660 --> 00:29:30,660
Yeah.

741
00:29:30,660 --> 00:29:31,660
Maybe by accident.

742
00:29:31,660 --> 00:29:32,660
Maybe you didn't know better.

743
00:29:32,660 --> 00:29:33,660
I don't know.

744
00:29:33,660 --> 00:29:35,660
And you did it and people reacted in horror.

745
00:29:35,660 --> 00:29:37,660
They loved it.

746
00:29:37,660 --> 00:29:41,660
And you made the decision of I'm going to buy into it.

747
00:29:41,660 --> 00:29:42,660
Yeah.

748
00:29:42,660 --> 00:29:43,660
And that decision was wrong.

749
00:29:43,660 --> 00:29:45,660
It was a bad wrong decision.

750
00:29:45,660 --> 00:29:53,660
Although, I think we can all agree, the best way to eat a banana, squeeze it from the bottom, let the banana pop out, you catch it in your mouth.

751
00:29:53,660 --> 00:29:54,660
Yeah.

752
00:29:54,660 --> 00:29:56,660
And then you smile at the bananas.

753
00:29:56,660 --> 00:29:58,660
You swallow it.

754
00:29:58,660 --> 00:30:00,660
You see a shape of the banana in your throat.

755
00:30:00,660 --> 00:30:01,660
It's hilarious.

756
00:30:01,660 --> 00:30:03,660
Do it 30 more times.

757
00:30:03,660 --> 00:30:04,660
Hilarious.

758
00:30:04,660 --> 00:30:07,660
Right in front of them in that one sitting.

759
00:30:07,660 --> 00:30:10,660
We're kind of just ignoring the kiwi part, aren't we?

760
00:30:10,660 --> 00:30:13,660
Because there's no justification for that.

761
00:30:13,660 --> 00:30:16,660
That's beyond the pale.

762
00:30:16,660 --> 00:30:20,660
That came from a different point in the audience.

763
00:30:20,660 --> 00:30:21,660
No, listen.

764
00:30:21,660 --> 00:30:23,660
That's the hairy part.

765
00:30:23,660 --> 00:30:29,660
If you tell me any food stuff you eat with the hair on it, I will sit and I will listen to it.

766
00:30:29,660 --> 00:30:30,660
Don't say peach.

767
00:30:30,660 --> 00:30:31,660
That doesn't count.

768
00:30:31,660 --> 00:30:33,660
You know it doesn't count.

769
00:30:33,660 --> 00:30:40,660
You know it's different and you wanted to shout it anyway?

770
00:30:40,660 --> 00:30:45,660
I'm not interested in what hairy foods you eat, Detroit.

771
00:30:45,660 --> 00:30:50,660
Especially when, frankly, it's one or two voices of thousands.

772
00:30:50,660 --> 00:30:55,660
You must know if everyone's not shouting something, you shouldn't shout.

773
00:30:55,660 --> 00:31:03,660
Because if you're the only one shouting out the hairy food that everyone supposedly eats, they don't.

774
00:31:03,660 --> 00:31:06,660
Stop it.

775
00:31:06,660 --> 00:31:10,660
We're trying to save you.

776
00:31:10,660 --> 00:31:23,660
I cannot imagine an axis that one would eat a banana upon where scraping it with your teeth is remotely acceptable.

777
00:31:23,660 --> 00:31:29,660
There had to be at least a few times where you scrape too hard and break it and it falls on the floor.

778
00:31:29,660 --> 00:31:32,660
Unless you only peel off one section of peel.

779
00:31:32,660 --> 00:31:35,660
They scrape it with their teeth.

780
00:31:35,660 --> 00:31:39,660
You peel off one of four sections and then you scrape down.

781
00:31:39,660 --> 00:31:41,660
It's all bad.

782
00:31:41,660 --> 00:31:42,660
No, it's not good.

783
00:31:42,660 --> 00:31:44,660
I'm just saying.

784
00:31:44,660 --> 00:31:48,660
My daughter breaks a banana in half like it's a strength contest.

785
00:31:48,660 --> 00:31:49,660
That's great.

786
00:31:49,660 --> 00:31:50,660
I like that.

787
00:31:50,660 --> 00:31:53,660
She hit her banana and her daughter just goes.

788
00:31:53,660 --> 00:32:01,660
If your problem is that the fruit you're eating isn't light and airy enough, don't eat a banana.

789
00:32:01,660 --> 00:32:06,660
Famously, a thick fruit.

790
00:32:06,660 --> 00:32:10,660
Most of them are just kind of water and like latex.

791
00:32:10,660 --> 00:32:12,660
That's about what most fruits are.

792
00:32:12,660 --> 00:32:15,660
Orange, like gone.

793
00:32:15,660 --> 00:32:20,660
Bananas can't be that for you and it's weird that you want the banana to be that for you.

794
00:32:20,660 --> 00:32:23,660
There are also plenty of fruits that are designed to be eaten weird.

795
00:32:23,660 --> 00:32:25,660
Like we had to work at a pomegranate.

796
00:32:25,660 --> 00:32:30,660
We all had to get on board with the way to harvest a pomegranate and agree it was worth the trouble.

797
00:32:30,660 --> 00:32:32,660
Banana easy to eat.

798
00:32:32,660 --> 00:32:35,660
Yeah, that one's got the whole system built right in.

799
00:32:35,660 --> 00:32:39,660
It's like God in his infinite wisdom put a handle on it.

800
00:32:39,660 --> 00:32:41,660
Here he goes again.

801
00:32:41,660 --> 00:32:52,660
I would love to watch you eat a banana in front of Kirk Cameron and turn him into a stone cold atheist.

802
00:32:52,660 --> 00:32:53,660
You're right.

803
00:32:53,660 --> 00:32:54,660
You're right.

804
00:32:54,660 --> 00:32:55,660
It all makes sense.

805
00:32:55,660 --> 00:32:59,660
I know what I said, but wow.

806
00:32:59,660 --> 00:33:01,660
It is a broken system.

807
00:33:01,660 --> 00:33:15,660
I've never cussed before, but holy shit.

808
00:33:15,660 --> 00:33:19,660
If you're anything like me around this time of year, you typically find yourself saying,

809
00:33:19,660 --> 00:33:27,660
wow, I really wish that I had just prepared even a little bit, just a little bit of advanced preparation.

810
00:33:27,660 --> 00:33:29,660
This is earlier.

811
00:33:29,660 --> 00:33:30,660
This is now.

812
00:33:30,660 --> 00:33:36,660
You're in that moment and there is no better partner for that than stamps.com.

813
00:33:36,660 --> 00:33:38,660
It'll make it so easy.

814
00:33:38,660 --> 00:33:42,660
You'll want to get out ahead of your holiday shopping that you need to do.

815
00:33:42,660 --> 00:33:55,660
Stamps.com is a one stop shop, not just USPS fine service that it is, but also UPS services need to run your holiday operation right from your computer.

816
00:33:55,660 --> 00:33:57,660
You don't have to deal with the lines.

817
00:33:57,660 --> 00:33:58,660
There's no traffic.

818
00:33:58,660 --> 00:33:59,660

826
00:34:26,660 --> 00:34:30,660
Hey, while I've got you here and you're doing this shopping, you got your stamps all covered.

827
00:34:30,660 --> 00:34:31,660
Fantastic.

828
00:34:31,660 --> 00:34:34,660
But how do you know that you're getting the best deal outside of the world of stamps?

829
00:34:34,660 --> 00:34:38,660
Well, there, my friend, you're going to rely on Honey.

830
00:34:38,660 --> 00:34:43,660
It's a really easy to install browser extension.

831
00:34:43,660 --> 00:34:47,660
PayPal Honey makes it easy to see if you could save a little bit of money.

832
00:34:47,660 --> 00:34:52,660
It takes, you know, a couple of clicks to install it in this free tool.

833
00:34:52,660 --> 00:34:57,660
When you go to check out, it'll look for coupons for what you are purchasing.

834
00:34:57,660 --> 00:35:04,660
And that is thrilling because you get to save some money that you didn't think you were going to save.

835
00:35:04,660 --> 00:35:07,660
I mean, what better feeling is there than that?

836
00:35:07,660 --> 00:35:10,660
Honey will look for a coupon and find something that works.

837
00:35:10,660 --> 00:35:12,660
The price just drops just like that.

838
00:35:12,660 --> 00:35:18,660
I've saved money on a lot of tools for woodworking.

839
00:35:18,660 --> 00:35:21,660
I've gotten some headphones at a really nice discount.

840
00:35:21,660 --> 00:35:22,660
Hachi machi.

841
00:35:22,660 --> 00:35:25,660
You're just losing money to not install Honey.

842
00:35:25,660 --> 00:35:30,660
You can save even more when you ask Honey to keep track of price drops on your holiday shopping list.

843
00:35:30,660 --> 00:35:33,660
If the price drops in anything on your list, you instantly get an alert to let you know.

844
00:35:33,660 --> 00:35:37,660
If you don't already have Honey, you're just missing out.

845
00:35:37,660 --> 00:35:41,660
By getting it, you'll be doing yourself a solid and you're supporting our show.

846
00:35:41,660 --> 00:35:43,660
You like our show, right?

847
00:35:43,660 --> 00:35:46,660
Get PayPal Honey for free at joinhoney.com slash brother.

848
00:35:46,660 --> 00:35:50,660
That's joinhoney.com slash brother.

849
00:35:50,660 --> 00:35:52,660
And now, back to the show.

850
00:35:54,660 --> 00:35:55,660
Hey, I'm Dan McCoy.

851
00:35:55,660 --> 00:35:56,660
I'm Stuart Wellington.

852
00:35:56,660 --> 00:35:58,660
And I'm Elliot Kalin.

853
00:35:58,660 --> 00:35:59,660
Listen, you like podcasts, right?

854
00:35:59,660 --> 00:36:00,660
Sure you do.

855
00:36:00,660 --> 00:36:01,660
Don't try and lie to me.

856
00:36:01,660 --> 00:36:02,660
You're listening to one right now.

857
00:36:02,660 --> 00:36:06,660
So why not try a different one called our one, The Flophouse.

858
00:36:06,660 --> 00:36:09,660
And on The Flophouse, we watch a movie and talk about it.

859
00:36:09,660 --> 00:36:11,660
And then sometimes we also do other stuff.

860
00:36:11,660 --> 00:36:14,660
It's all meant to be funny and fun, and we think you'll have a good time.

861
00:36:14,660 --> 00:36:18,660
And just to be clear, the name of the podcast is not our one, The Flophouse.

862
00:36:18,660 --> 00:36:19,660
It's just called The Flophouse.

863
00:36:19,660 --> 00:36:21,660
I do a lot of correcting Dan.

864
00:36:21,660 --> 00:36:24,660
The Flophouse, a lot of correcting Dan.

865
00:36:27,660 --> 00:36:31,660
Hey, it's Jon Moe, inviting you to listen to Depressed Mode with Jon Moe,

866
00:36:31,660 --> 00:36:35,660
where I talk about mental health and the lives we live with all kinds of people.

867
00:36:35,660 --> 00:36:36,660
Famous writers.

868
00:36:36,660 --> 00:36:38,660
David Sedaris, welcome to Depressed Mode.

869
00:36:38,660 --> 00:36:40,660
Thanks so much for having me.

870
00:36:40,660 --> 00:36:41,660
Movie stars.

871
00:36:41,660 --> 00:36:43,660
Jamie Lee Curtis, welcome to Depressed Mode.

872
00:36:43,660 --> 00:36:45,660
I am happy to be here.

873
00:36:45,660 --> 00:36:46,660
Musicians.

874
00:36:46,660 --> 00:36:47,660
I am in St. Paul, Minnesota.

875
00:36:47,660 --> 00:36:49,660
I'm talking to Amy Mann.

876
00:36:49,660 --> 00:36:50,660
Great to talk to you.

877
00:36:50,660 --> 00:36:52,660
And song exploders.

878
00:36:52,660 --> 00:36:54,660
Rishi K. Sherway, welcome to Depressed Mode.

879
00:36:54,660 --> 00:36:55,660
Thanks so much for having me.

880
00:36:55,660 --> 00:37:19,660
Everyone's opening up on Depressed Mode on Maximum Fun.

881
00:37:19,660 --> 00:37:29,660
I want to munch.

882
00:37:29,660 --> 00:37:30,660
Welcome to Munch Squad.

883
00:37:30,660 --> 00:37:36,660
It's a podcast, then a podcast profile, the latest, greatest brand eating.

884
00:37:36,660 --> 00:37:41,660
And I waited as long as I could because I got two different huge topics to cover.

885
00:37:41,660 --> 00:37:44,660
And the first one, you know we're going to talk about it, Detroit.

886
00:37:44,660 --> 00:37:46,660
I went to DoorDash.

887
00:37:46,660 --> 00:37:50,660
A app my father is incapable of using without ordering from Georgia.

888
00:37:50,660 --> 00:37:51,660
I've saved this, by the way.

889
00:37:51,660 --> 00:37:54,660
He's told this story multiple times this evening.

890
00:37:54,660 --> 00:37:57,660
There's a moment when you try to order from a different place where DoorDash goes.

891
00:37:57,660 --> 00:37:58,660
You're pretty far away.

892
00:37:58,660 --> 00:37:59,660
You seem pretty far away.

893
00:37:59,660 --> 00:38:02,660
So you know, Dad went, never mind that.

894
00:38:02,660 --> 00:38:03,660
Oh, well.

895
00:38:03,660 --> 00:38:05,660
We'll figure it out.

896
00:38:05,660 --> 00:38:09,660
Hey, guys, let's talk about the crypto grill.

897
00:38:09,660 --> 00:38:15,660
If you go to DoorDash here, and I don't think it's a real place you can go to,

898
00:38:15,660 --> 00:38:20,660
which makes it probably the wildest ghost restaurant I've ever heard of in my life.

899
00:38:20,660 --> 00:38:22,660
Let's talk about the crypto grill.

900
00:38:22,660 --> 00:38:31,660
I have no context for any of this, but they do have a lot of different crypto themed items like the NFT milk.

901
00:38:31,660 --> 00:38:33,660
Like the crypto burger.

902
00:38:33,660 --> 00:38:36,660
That's the best you've got?

903
00:38:36,660 --> 00:38:38,660
Yeah, it gets worse, bud.

904
00:38:38,660 --> 00:38:41,660
Loaded cyber fries.

905
00:38:41,660 --> 00:38:43,660
But then also curly fries.

906
00:38:43,660 --> 00:38:46,660
They got curly fries or loaded cyber fries.

907
00:38:46,660 --> 00:38:51,660
If you order the curly fries from the crypto grill, fuck you.

908
00:38:51,660 --> 00:38:57,660
Man, do you remember like two decades ago when if you called the place Crypto Grill,

909
00:38:57,660 --> 00:38:59,660
it was about spooky stuff?

910
00:38:59,660 --> 00:39:00,660
Yeah, that's why I clicked on it.

911
00:39:00,660 --> 00:39:02,660
I thought I was going to get a Bigfoot burger.

912
00:39:02,660 --> 00:39:03,660
No dice.

913
00:39:03,660 --> 00:39:04,660
Damn it.

914
00:39:04,660 --> 00:39:05,660
Cyber fries is good.

915
00:39:05,660 --> 00:39:08,660
I will patronize them just for the cyber fries though.

916
00:39:08,660 --> 00:39:11,660
Because what do they have in there that makes them cyber?

917
00:39:11,660 --> 00:39:12,660
Chips.

918
00:39:12,660 --> 00:39:13,660
There's the beef.

919
00:39:13,660 --> 00:39:15,660
There's the beef dono.

920
00:39:15,660 --> 00:39:16,660
The baldana.

921
00:39:16,660 --> 00:39:17,660
The bytecoin.

922
00:39:17,660 --> 00:39:18,660
The bytecoin.

923
00:39:18,660 --> 00:39:20,660
The bytecoin is good.

924
00:39:20,660 --> 00:39:23,660
The ethereparm sandwich.

925
00:39:23,660 --> 00:39:24,660
That sucks.

926
00:39:24,660 --> 00:39:25,660
It's so bad.

927
00:39:25,660 --> 00:39:26,660
It's so bad.

928
00:39:26,660 --> 00:39:32,660
I will gladly write your new blockchain jokes for the blockchain burger.

929
00:39:32,660 --> 00:39:34,660
Ethereum mixed drink with rum in it.

930
00:39:34,660 --> 00:39:35,660
Yeah, there we go.

931
00:39:35,660 --> 00:39:36,660
The litecoin.

932
00:39:36,660 --> 00:39:39,660
And then they have brisket loaded waffle fries,

933
00:39:39,660 --> 00:39:42,660
which I looked at for a while and then thought that's just that.

934
00:39:42,660 --> 00:39:44,660
Yeah.

935
00:39:44,660 --> 00:39:50,660
Then there's also an item on here called the Crypto Lettuce Surprise You Sauce.

936
00:39:50,660 --> 00:39:52,660
I don't believe I will actually.

937
00:39:52,660 --> 00:39:54,660
Thank you for asking.

938
00:39:54,660 --> 00:39:56,660
Let us pick the best sauce for what you ordered.

939
00:39:56,660 --> 00:40:02,660
What in our relationship lets you think I trust you with anything?

940
00:40:02,660 --> 00:40:03,660
With anything.

941
00:40:03,660 --> 00:40:09,660
I love the Crypto Sauce are the only words in there outside of quotation wise.

942
00:40:09,660 --> 00:40:13,660
So it says Crypto Lettuce Surprise You Sauce.

943
00:40:13,660 --> 00:40:16,660
So crypto has nothing to do with it whatsoever.

944
00:40:16,660 --> 00:40:19,660
But they also have a Superman cheesecake,

945
00:40:19,660 --> 00:40:22,660
which has nothing to do with crypto, but is a specific reference.

946
00:40:22,660 --> 00:40:23,660
Don't be cowards.

947
00:40:23,660 --> 00:40:28,660
By the time we come back here and perform in four more calendar years in Detroit, Michigan,

948
00:40:28,660 --> 00:40:30,660
I expect them to have their act together.

949
00:40:30,660 --> 00:40:31,660
Yeah.

950
00:40:31,660 --> 00:40:35,660
I did want to talk about, you know, because we want to make this show special.

951
00:40:35,660 --> 00:40:37,660
I want to do a Munch Squad about one that's just good.

952
00:40:37,660 --> 00:40:38,660
Okay.

953
00:40:38,660 --> 00:40:39,660
This is Burger King.

954
00:40:39,660 --> 00:40:40,660
I was thinking about him recently.

955
00:40:40,660 --> 00:40:42,660
Like, you don't hear about them getting the mix.

956
00:40:42,660 --> 00:40:44,660
They don't get nasty so much.

957
00:40:44,660 --> 00:40:48,660
They had that one foul up with the black burger bun that gave everybody weird poops.

958
00:40:48,660 --> 00:40:49,660
And then they quit.

959
00:40:49,660 --> 00:40:52,660
It was a pretty, it was a pretty big whoopsie they made.

960
00:40:52,660 --> 00:40:53,660
I will say.

961
00:40:53,660 --> 00:40:54,660
Yeah.

962
00:40:54,660 --> 00:40:58,660
But like, you know, Burger King does one weird poop food and Taco Bell is like,

963
00:40:58,660 --> 00:41:01,660
call me when you've mastered it.

964
00:41:01,660 --> 00:41:06,660
I literally, I had a thought, they got to do something to get back in the game.

965
00:41:06,660 --> 00:41:09,660
And then I found this press release from October 6th that said,

966
00:41:09,660 --> 00:41:13,660
today Burger King unveils its brand new positioning and campaign,

967
00:41:13,660 --> 00:41:17,660
kicking off with its modernized tagline, you rule.

968
00:41:17,660 --> 00:41:20,660
The work is part of the change guests nationwide will experience

969
00:41:20,660 --> 00:41:24,660
as the brand implements its reclaim the flame plan,

970
00:41:24,660 --> 00:41:26,660
which means that no one likes Burger King.

971
00:41:26,660 --> 00:41:28,660
Wait, now hold on. Listen.

972
00:41:28,660 --> 00:41:32,660
Reclaim the flame as a slogan announced by, let's say,

973
00:41:32,660 --> 00:41:37,660
many groups that exist within the US of A is a terrifying statement.

974
00:41:37,660 --> 00:41:38,660
Yes.

975
00:41:38,660 --> 00:41:44,660
It also could be like, Ashen One, you must travel across these blighted lands.

976
00:41:44,660 --> 00:41:47,660
Reclaim the flame.

977
00:41:47,660 --> 00:41:48,660
So reclaim.

978
00:41:48,660 --> 00:41:51,660
Here's a skeleton horse or some shit.

979
00:41:51,660 --> 00:41:54,660
So reclaim the flame is the superstructure.

980
00:41:54,660 --> 00:41:58,660
And then this is part of the fuel the flame advertising co-investment

981
00:41:58,660 --> 00:42:00,660
between Burger King and its franchisees.

982
00:42:00,660 --> 00:42:01,660
It's the you rule.

983
00:42:01,660 --> 00:42:02,660
Who's hungry?

984
00:42:02,660 --> 00:42:03,660
Campaign.

985
00:42:03,660 --> 00:42:07,660
It's a key part of their positioning that will impact every guest's touch point.

986
00:42:07,660 --> 00:42:08,660
It's about.

987
00:42:08,660 --> 00:42:11,660
My touch points.

988
00:42:11,660 --> 00:42:14,660
It's about celebrating everyday royalty

989
00:42:14,660 --> 00:42:18,660
and puts the guests at the forefront of everything the brand does.

990
00:42:18,660 --> 00:42:21,660
I feel pampered in this Burger King tonight.

991
00:42:21,660 --> 00:42:25,660
In a partnership, in a partnership with our new creative agency,

992
00:42:25,660 --> 00:42:29,660
OKRP, it's OKRP.

993
00:42:29,660 --> 00:42:31,660
We've developed a simple and meaningful articulation

994
00:42:31,660 --> 00:42:33,660
of how Burger King celebrates our guests.

995
00:42:33,660 --> 00:42:36,660
It embodies our purpose, embraces individuality,

996
00:42:36,660 --> 00:42:38,660
and elevates have it your way.

997
00:42:38,660 --> 00:42:41,660
Something our brand has always been known for.

998
00:42:41,660 --> 00:42:49,660
OKRP is the review we get most often on Adventure Zone on iTunes.

999
00:42:49,660 --> 00:42:52,660
It's fucking mean. Yeah.

1000
00:42:52,660 --> 00:42:56,660
Now, I know there's this.

1001
00:42:56,660 --> 00:42:57,660
Here's the quote.

1002
00:42:57,660 --> 00:43:04,660
Advertising at its best is this is most relevant.

1003
00:43:04,660 --> 00:43:07,660
I feel like Don Draper is click clicking through a slide.

1004
00:43:07,660 --> 00:43:08,660
Yeah.

1005
00:43:08,660 --> 00:43:12,660
So when you celebrate them first, not the brand.

1006
00:43:12,660 --> 00:43:14,660
And that's just what we love about you rule.

1007
00:43:14,660 --> 00:43:19,660
It invites people in with an approach that recognizes their world,

1008
00:43:19,660 --> 00:43:21,660
not just sell some stuff.

1009
00:43:21,660 --> 00:43:22,660
That's great.

1010
00:43:22,660 --> 00:43:23,660
Now, OK.

1011
00:43:23,660 --> 00:43:26,660
Now, we're given that this one's pretty rough.

1012
00:43:26,660 --> 00:43:29,660
We're giving them permission to feel like winners.

1013
00:43:29,660 --> 00:43:32,660
Holy shit.

1014
00:43:32,660 --> 00:43:35,660
So they know what they're doing because I was about to say

1015
00:43:35,660 --> 00:43:38,660
have it your way reflects on the eating experience.

1016
00:43:38,660 --> 00:43:40,660
But you rules just like, hey.

1017
00:43:40,660 --> 00:43:42,660
Hey, man.

1018
00:43:42,660 --> 00:43:47,660
We're we are giving them permission to feel like winners with Burger King

1019
00:43:47,660 --> 00:43:51,660
as just a small award that makes their day a bit better.

1020
00:43:51,660 --> 00:43:52,660
Hey, Burger King.

1021
00:43:52,660 --> 00:43:54,660
Congrats on the self-awareness.

1022
00:43:54,660 --> 00:43:58,660
That's a huge first step.

1023
00:43:58,660 --> 00:43:59,660
This is going to make your day.

1024
00:43:59,660 --> 00:44:00,660
Is it going to fix everything?

1025
00:44:00,660 --> 00:44:02,660
Nope. Nope. Nope.

1026
00:44:02,660 --> 00:44:03,660
We'll win, though.

1027
00:44:03,660 --> 00:44:04,660
Little W for the.

1028
00:44:04,660 --> 00:44:07,660
You know that this isn't a healthy, responsible choice.

1029
00:44:07,660 --> 00:44:09,660
This is the little win.

1030
00:44:09,660 --> 00:44:10,660
And let's face it.

1031
00:44:10,660 --> 00:44:12,660
The song is irresistible.

1032
00:44:12,660 --> 00:44:16,660
What the song is irresistible.

1033
00:44:16,660 --> 00:44:17,660
We're hoping it'll be the earworm.

1034
00:44:17,660 --> 00:44:19,660
You can't shake off.

1035
00:44:19,660 --> 00:44:22,660
And that's my gift to you, Detroit.

1036
00:44:22,660 --> 00:44:24,660
Paul, Bud, let's bump it.

1037
00:44:24,660 --> 00:44:31,660
I do things the way I want to do them.

1038
00:44:31,660 --> 00:44:33,660
Make my own rules and listen to them.

1039
00:44:33,660 --> 00:44:38,660
Won't let anyone go and rain on my parade.

1040
00:44:38,660 --> 00:44:40,660
I think I want a flame grill, classical whopper.

1041
00:44:40,660 --> 00:44:42,660
Sure does sound fantastic.

1042
00:44:42,660 --> 00:44:43,660
I tell them how I want to have it.

1043
00:44:43,660 --> 00:44:46,660
They say, OK.

1044
00:44:46,660 --> 00:44:52,660
You rule your seasons a day at BK.

1045
00:44:52,660 --> 00:44:54,660
Have it your way.

1046
00:44:54,660 --> 00:44:55,660
You rule.

1047
00:44:55,660 --> 00:44:57,660
If I want it special, we're just playing.

1048
00:44:57,660 --> 00:44:59,660
The choice I make is my domain.

1049
00:44:59,660 --> 00:45:02,660
With every order, I can reign and have them my way.

1050
00:45:02,660 --> 00:45:03,660
Tall burgers.

1051
00:45:03,660 --> 00:45:05,660
The BK menu makes sure my stomach prospers.

1052
00:45:05,660 --> 00:45:07,660
Onion rings, chicken fries, and whopper.

1053
00:45:07,660 --> 00:45:10,660
Any food I think is proper, I can have it my way.

1054
00:45:10,660 --> 00:45:11,660
Get off the table.

1055
00:45:11,660 --> 00:45:14,660
You rule your seasons a day at BK.

1056
00:45:14,660 --> 00:45:17,660
I just can't stop dancing, Justin.

1057
00:45:17,660 --> 00:45:19,660
Have it your way.

1058
00:45:19,660 --> 00:45:21,660
You rule.

1059
00:45:21,660 --> 00:45:22,660
All right.

1060
00:45:22,660 --> 00:45:23,660
Right?

1061
00:45:23,660 --> 00:45:25,660
It's good.

1062
00:45:25,660 --> 00:45:26,660
It's really good.

1063
00:45:26,660 --> 00:45:27,660
That's all.

1064
00:45:27,660 --> 00:45:28,660
I just like the song.

1065
00:45:28,660 --> 00:45:29,660
I thought you'd like to hear it.

1066
00:45:29,660 --> 00:45:30,660
And it speaks to the youth.

1067
00:45:30,660 --> 00:45:31,660
That's the important thing.

1068
00:45:31,660 --> 00:45:32,660
I think if I walk.

1069
00:45:32,660 --> 00:45:34,660
They love chicken fries.

1070
00:45:34,660 --> 00:45:37,660
If I walk into a fucking Burger King and I say,

1071
00:45:37,660 --> 00:45:40,660
I would like the chicken fries value combo special meal,

1072
00:45:40,660 --> 00:45:41,660
please.

1073
00:45:41,660 --> 00:45:43,660
And then they're like, that's $4.89.

1074
00:45:43,660 --> 00:45:47,660
And then I'm like, I am not going to pay.

1075
00:45:47,660 --> 00:45:52,660
Because I have very recently been informed I'm in charge.

1076
00:45:52,660 --> 00:45:54,660
I'm the Burger King now, dog.

1077
00:45:54,660 --> 00:45:55,660
I know what you're wondering.

1078
00:45:55,660 --> 00:45:57,660
Why did I walk inside of a Burger King?

1079
00:45:57,660 --> 00:46:00,660
And it's because I'm claiming this Burger King for myself now.

1080
00:46:00,660 --> 00:46:03,660
You should have to assassinate the Burger King

1081
00:46:03,660 --> 00:46:06,660
when you walk into every Burger King.

1082
00:46:06,660 --> 00:46:07,660
Yeah.

1083
00:46:07,660 --> 00:46:09,660
Why did you do that?

1084
00:46:09,660 --> 00:46:11,660
I rule now.

1085
00:46:11,660 --> 00:46:12,660
I rule.

1086
00:46:12,660 --> 00:46:13,660
I rule.

1087
00:46:13,660 --> 00:46:14,660
I have something of my own.

1088
00:46:14,660 --> 00:46:19,660
Give me chicken fries until I tell you to stop.

1089
00:46:19,660 --> 00:46:20,660
I've had three of them.

1090
00:46:20,660 --> 00:46:21,660
Stop.

1091
00:46:21,660 --> 00:46:22,660
Stop.

1092
00:46:22,660 --> 00:46:23,660
I'll ask the king.

1093
00:46:23,660 --> 00:46:26,660
The king is dead.

1094
00:46:26,660 --> 00:46:27,660
I'm your king.

1095
00:46:27,660 --> 00:46:28,660
I'm the king now.

1096
00:46:28,660 --> 00:46:30,660
That's your Munch Squad for this week.

1097
00:46:30,660 --> 00:46:31,660
Thank you so much.

1098
00:46:31,660 --> 00:46:37,660
Should we turn it to some audience questions?

1099
00:46:37,660 --> 00:46:38,660
Yes, we should.

1100
00:46:38,660 --> 00:46:41,660
We received some questions from the audience.

1101
00:46:41,660 --> 00:46:45,660
We are going to call you down and just approach the mic.

1102
00:46:45,660 --> 00:46:46,660
It's here.

1103
00:46:46,660 --> 00:46:47,660
Center stage.

1104
00:46:47,660 --> 00:46:50,660
It is facing us, but you don't have to use it that way.

1105
00:46:50,660 --> 00:46:52,660
Please turn it so you're looking at us.

1106
00:46:52,660 --> 00:46:54,660
Please turn it so you're looking at us.

1107
00:46:54,660 --> 00:46:56,660
Yeah, that would be fantastic, actually.

1108
00:46:56,660 --> 00:46:57,660
Hello.

1109
00:46:57,660 --> 00:46:58,660
Hi.

1110
00:46:58,660 --> 00:46:59,660
My name is Luke.

1111
00:46:59,660 --> 00:47:00,660
Hey, Luke.

1112
00:47:00,660 --> 00:47:01,660
Nice to see him.

1113
00:47:01,660 --> 00:47:02,660
Hi, Luke.

1114
00:47:02,660 --> 00:47:03,660
What's your question?

1115
00:47:03,660 --> 00:47:04,660
So I'm an OB doctor.

1116
00:47:04,660 --> 00:47:05,660
I deliver babies.

1117
00:47:05,660 --> 00:47:06,660
Yeah.

1118
00:47:06,660 --> 00:47:07,660
Nice.

1119
00:47:07,660 --> 00:47:08,660
Nice.

1120
00:47:08,660 --> 00:47:10,660
Like the person who delivers pizzas.

1121
00:47:10,660 --> 00:47:11,660
We get it.

1122
00:47:11,660 --> 00:47:12,660
Right.

1123
00:47:12,660 --> 00:47:13,660
Yeah.

1124
00:47:13,660 --> 00:47:14,660
Yeah.

1125
00:47:14,660 --> 00:47:18,660
Very often babies are born that don't have names, and occasionally the parents will ask

1126
00:47:18,660 --> 00:47:21,660
me what my name is, and it's always a little awkward.

1127
00:47:21,660 --> 00:47:25,180
I don't know if I should say my real name or if I should give a fake name because I

1128
00:47:25,180 --> 00:47:27,180
don't want the baby to steal my name.

1129
00:47:27,180 --> 00:47:28,180
Sure, yeah.

1130
00:47:28,180 --> 00:47:29,180
Yeah.

1131
00:47:29,180 --> 00:47:30,180
No, no, no.

1132
00:47:30,180 --> 00:47:33,180
The baby is like could be a Baba Yaga who's going to steal-

1133
00:47:33,180 --> 00:47:34,180
Thank you.

1134
00:47:34,180 --> 00:47:35,180
Then have power over you.

1135
00:47:35,180 --> 00:47:38,180
Does the parent say it like this?

1136
00:47:38,180 --> 00:47:39,180
I don't have a name.

1137
00:47:39,180 --> 00:47:40,180
What's your name?

1138
00:47:40,180 --> 00:47:41,180
Hey.

1139
00:47:41,180 --> 00:47:42,180
Like how do you breathe?

1140
00:47:42,180 --> 00:47:43,180
Like I don't understand.

1141
00:47:43,180 --> 00:47:46,180
That's a risky gambit because you could, I'll say this.

1142
00:47:46,180 --> 00:47:49,180
Luke, fantastic name, could have a really shitty name.

1143
00:47:49,180 --> 00:47:50,180
Like Griffin.

1144
00:47:50,180 --> 00:47:52,180
No, that's, Griffin's good.

1145
00:47:52,180 --> 00:47:55,180
I think it would be kind of cool to know that your name says wonder.

1146
00:47:55,180 --> 00:47:57,180
I bet I could make myself cry on stage right now.

1147
00:47:57,180 --> 00:48:02,180
I think it would be kind of cool to know that your namesake is out there wandering around.

1148
00:48:02,180 --> 00:48:08,180
Like sometime you might see them, just look them in the eye and say, Luke, I am your doctor.

1149
00:48:08,180 --> 00:48:13,180
Justin, that was, no, no, no, no, no.

1150
00:48:13,180 --> 00:48:22,180
You, you crept toward the line, the precipice and you peeked over it, which I applaud you

1151
00:48:22,180 --> 00:48:23,180
for.

1152
00:48:23,180 --> 00:48:24,180
It's very brave.

1153
00:48:24,180 --> 00:48:26,180
You did make a Star Wars joke on stage.

1154
00:48:26,180 --> 00:48:28,180
Right, but it's tasteful.

1155
00:48:28,180 --> 00:48:31,180
And that's why I'll say this gang.

1156
00:48:31,180 --> 00:48:35,180
He could have made that joke at any show and not, it wasn't just for your benefit.

1157
00:48:35,180 --> 00:48:37,180
It just happened to be right.

1158
00:48:37,180 --> 00:48:41,180
This is how recently I was talking with my daughters and they're both named after people.

1159
00:48:41,180 --> 00:48:43,180
And then BB said, who are you named after?

1160
00:48:43,180 --> 00:48:44,180
And I go, I don't know.

1161
00:48:44,180 --> 00:48:45,180
No one.

1162
00:48:45,180 --> 00:48:48,180
And like my parents threw a dart at a board and picked traffic.

1163
00:48:48,180 --> 00:48:49,180
I don't know.

1164
00:48:49,180 --> 00:48:55,180
I think the being named after someone, even if I think being named after the doctor, imagine

1165
00:48:55,180 --> 00:49:00,180
if in like 10 years, it's like the most popular kid name, Luke.

1166
00:49:00,180 --> 00:49:01,180
And it's because of you.

1167
00:49:01,180 --> 00:49:04,180
I don't know how many babies you're delivering in a given day.

1168
00:49:04,180 --> 00:49:07,180
Is it enough to move the needle statistics wise?

1169
00:49:07,180 --> 00:49:08,180
Start insisting.

1170
00:49:08,180 --> 00:49:10,180
Hey, do you have a baby name picked out?

1171
00:49:10,180 --> 00:49:11,180
Don't even answer.

1172
00:49:11,180 --> 00:49:12,180
It's Luke.

1173
00:49:12,180 --> 00:49:13,180
Next.

1174
00:49:13,180 --> 00:49:17,180
Nurse, write down Luke.

1175
00:49:17,180 --> 00:49:22,180
Nurse, you misspelled Luke.

1176
00:49:22,180 --> 00:49:29,180
Does that, does that help Luke?

1177
00:49:29,180 --> 00:49:30,180
Yeah.

1178
00:49:30,180 --> 00:49:31,180
Thank you, brothers.

1179
00:49:31,180 --> 00:49:32,180
You're very welcome.

1180
00:49:32,180 --> 00:49:35,180
Thank you for joining us.

1181
00:49:35,180 --> 00:49:39,180
Next approach the crucible.

1182
00:49:39,180 --> 00:49:40,180
So I am Phil.

1183
00:49:40,180 --> 00:49:43,180
What is your, your question?

1184
00:49:43,180 --> 00:49:44,180
How can we help?

1185
00:49:44,180 --> 00:49:50,180
So my wife's fire department is hiring and they've had a few too many recruits who have

1186
00:49:50,180 --> 00:49:56,180
shown up taking pictures in all the gear with all the equipment and then left.

1187
00:49:56,180 --> 00:49:57,180
Yeah.

1188
00:49:57,180 --> 00:49:59,180
That happened with us and the fourth brother.

1189
00:49:59,180 --> 00:50:00,180
No, I get it.

1190
00:50:00,180 --> 00:50:01,180
Yeah, I get it.

1191
00:50:01,180 --> 00:50:02,180
Yeah.

1192
00:50:02,180 --> 00:50:09,180
So how can she recruit new firefighters that are interested in more than just a few good

1193
00:50:09,180 --> 00:50:10,180
Instagram pictures?

1194
00:50:10,180 --> 00:50:14,180
Well, welcome to the biggest problem we have on earth.

1195
00:50:14,180 --> 00:50:15,180
Yeah.

1196
00:50:15,180 --> 00:50:16,180
How to fight off people.

1197
00:50:16,180 --> 00:50:17,180
It is.

1198
00:50:17,180 --> 00:50:18,180
It is.

1199
00:50:18,180 --> 00:50:19,180
I appreciate your help.

1200
00:50:19,180 --> 00:50:21,180
How to fight off Instagram influencer.

1201
00:50:21,180 --> 00:50:25,180
Yeah, it's firefighter stolen valor is probably our biggest issue.

1202
00:50:25,180 --> 00:50:29,180
I think they have to fight one before they can do a picture.

1203
00:50:29,180 --> 00:50:31,180
If it's your first one other firefighter.

1204
00:50:31,180 --> 00:50:32,180
Yeah.

1205
00:50:32,180 --> 00:50:33,180
You have to fight.

1206
00:50:33,180 --> 00:50:36,180
No, I'm a firefighter fighter.

1207
00:50:36,180 --> 00:50:38,180
If, listen, here's what I'm saying.

1208
00:50:38,180 --> 00:50:44,180
If I'm going to take it from one of the other ones, our volunteer and professional firefighters,

1209
00:50:44,180 --> 00:50:45,180
they're heroes, right?

1210
00:50:45,180 --> 00:50:51,180
If I'm going to get a picture of myself, I want one of me doing the fighting of a fire.

1211
00:50:51,180 --> 00:50:56,180
Like if I'm going to get one picture, I want it to look cool like I'm doing the fire stuff.

1212
00:50:56,180 --> 00:50:59,180
Otherwise, I was just really good at ordering costumes.

1213
00:50:59,180 --> 00:51:00,180
Yeah, right.

1214
00:51:00,180 --> 00:51:01,180
I want to get one.

1215
00:51:01,180 --> 00:51:02,180
One under the belt.

1216
00:51:02,180 --> 00:51:03,180
Yeah.

1217
00:51:03,180 --> 00:51:05,180
One where a fire is going.

1218
00:51:05,180 --> 00:51:10,180
I don't know how you guarantee that, though, without arson.

1219
00:51:10,180 --> 00:51:11,180
Well, okay.

1220
00:51:11,180 --> 00:51:14,180
I was going to say you could start fires anywhere, but then that's arson.

1221
00:51:14,180 --> 00:51:16,180
Yeah, it's fucked up, isn't it?

1222
00:51:16,180 --> 00:51:18,180
I hate that they-

1223
00:51:18,180 --> 00:51:19,180
That sucks.

1224
00:51:19,180 --> 00:51:20,180
That's illegal.

1225
00:51:20,180 --> 00:51:21,180
Hey, guys, let's grow up.

1226
00:51:21,180 --> 00:51:23,180
Arson is generally frowned upon, yeah.

1227
00:51:23,180 --> 00:51:25,180
Does she ever pressure you to join?

1228
00:51:25,180 --> 00:51:26,180
She does actually.

1229
00:51:26,180 --> 00:51:28,180
She doesn't want me to because that's her thing.

1230
00:51:28,180 --> 00:51:32,180
Yeah, but you do look like you have beat a fire's ass, Phil.

1231
00:51:32,180 --> 00:51:34,180
She's way tougher than I am.

1232
00:51:34,180 --> 00:51:37,180
Does she ever look at a picture of a fire in the paper and be like, dang, Phil, wish

1233
00:51:37,180 --> 00:51:39,180
somebody had gotten there, huh?

1234
00:51:39,180 --> 00:51:42,180
I want you to know, Phil, I don't want you to be a firefighter.

1235
00:51:42,180 --> 00:51:43,180
Yeah.

1236
00:51:43,180 --> 00:51:46,180
You seem very blasé about it.

1237
00:51:46,180 --> 00:51:50,180
I'm just saying it's not a quality I look for in a firefighter.

1238
00:51:50,180 --> 00:51:53,180
I don't want firefighters like, yeah, okay.

1239
00:51:53,180 --> 00:51:57,180
You seem like you-

1240
00:51:57,180 --> 00:52:00,180
You seem like you-

1241
00:52:00,180 --> 00:52:04,180
When pressed, you might actually join the fire.

1242
00:52:04,180 --> 00:52:09,180
It's making some good points.

1243
00:52:09,180 --> 00:52:14,180
Oh, no, this new firefighter recruit we got just became more fire.

1244
00:52:14,180 --> 00:52:18,180
Yeah, but I'm just saying, did you see some of the political signs that the House had?

1245
00:52:18,180 --> 00:52:20,180
That's the opposite of what we wanted.

1246
00:52:20,180 --> 00:52:24,180
The media has misrepresented the fire in a pretty major way, okay?

1247
00:52:24,180 --> 00:52:26,180
If you take the time-

1248
00:52:26,180 --> 00:52:32,180
That fire makes some good points on its Twitter.

1249
00:52:32,180 --> 00:52:36,180
Does that help, Phil?

1250
00:52:36,180 --> 00:52:37,180
We'll go with yes.

1251
00:52:37,180 --> 00:52:38,180
Yeah, sure.

1252
00:52:38,180 --> 00:52:39,180
Okay, yeah, thanks, Phil.

1253
00:52:39,180 --> 00:52:40,180
Thank you, brothers.

1254
00:52:40,180 --> 00:52:45,180
See you, bud.

1255
00:52:45,180 --> 00:52:47,180
Hello.

1256
00:52:47,180 --> 00:52:48,180
How's it going?

1257
00:52:48,180 --> 00:52:49,180
Hi, I'm Bell.

1258
00:52:49,180 --> 00:52:50,180
My pronouns are she, her.

1259
00:52:50,180 --> 00:52:51,180
Hi, Bell.

1260
00:52:51,180 --> 00:52:54,180
As per my email, I run a LARP-

1261
00:52:54,180 --> 00:53:00,180
Chill my last up my spine, Bell.

1262
00:53:00,180 --> 00:53:01,180
All right.

1263
00:53:01,180 --> 00:53:02,180
Sorry, Bell, go ahead.

1264
00:53:02,180 --> 00:53:04,180
I run a LARP chapter in Toledo.

1265
00:53:04,180 --> 00:53:12,180
I've been trying to get more people to join my part, but the Venn diagram of dorks who want to sword fight

1266
00:53:12,180 --> 00:53:17,180
and people who want to go out to a park on every afternoon of every Saturday, it's kind of slim.

1267
00:53:17,180 --> 00:53:18,180
Sure.

1268
00:53:18,180 --> 00:53:19,180
Right?

1269
00:53:19,180 --> 00:53:20,180
How do I get more people to join?

1270
00:53:20,180 --> 00:53:21,180
How many do you need?

1271
00:53:21,180 --> 00:53:23,180
I'll take as many as I can.

1272
00:53:23,180 --> 00:53:26,180
Yeah, I mean, Travis, the answer to that question is two.

1273
00:53:26,180 --> 00:53:28,180
Just have a bucket, just like nonstop.

1274
00:53:28,180 --> 00:53:30,180
Well, okay, you say sword fighting.

1275
00:53:30,180 --> 00:53:31,180
Yeah.

1276
00:53:31,180 --> 00:53:35,180
I think there's a lot of other things going on in a given village.

1277
00:53:35,180 --> 00:53:36,180
Sure.

1278
00:53:36,180 --> 00:53:40,180
That you could be like, hey, do you want to sleep but in old-timey clothes?

1279
00:53:40,180 --> 00:53:41,180
Yeah.

1280
00:53:41,180 --> 00:53:45,180
Yeah, or we teach a lot of craft stuff.

1281
00:53:45,180 --> 00:53:46,180
Alchemy.

1282
00:53:46,180 --> 00:53:47,180
Leatherworking, sewing, stuff like that.

1283
00:53:47,180 --> 00:53:48,180
Yes.

1284
00:53:48,180 --> 00:53:49,180
Alchemy, sure.

1285
00:53:49,180 --> 00:53:52,180
Rune crafting.

1286
00:53:52,180 --> 00:53:56,180
I say this as someone who is now 39 and I have no idea what the answer to this is.

1287
00:53:56,180 --> 00:53:59,180
Is that something that looks good on a college application?

1288
00:53:59,180 --> 00:54:00,180
Rune crafting?

1289
00:54:00,180 --> 00:54:01,180
Yeah, for sure.

1290
00:54:01,180 --> 00:54:02,180
Yeah, absolutely.

1291
00:54:02,180 --> 00:54:07,180
I know people at the park they started back in Texas that will actually have like, yeah,

1292
00:54:07,180 --> 00:54:10,180
I've organized all kinds of events like on their resume and it looks good because it

1293
00:54:10,180 --> 00:54:12,180
shows that you know how to like organize stuff.

1294
00:54:12,180 --> 00:54:13,180
For sure.

1295
00:54:13,180 --> 00:54:15,180
Okay, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

1296
00:54:15,180 --> 00:54:17,180
You don't need to recruit people.

1297
00:54:17,180 --> 00:54:22,180
You need to go to a busier park and then everyone there is here.

1298
00:54:22,180 --> 00:54:23,180
Yeah.

1299
00:54:23,180 --> 00:54:25,180
Listen, I will say this.

1300
00:54:25,180 --> 00:54:29,180
You hit someone enough times the foam sword, something's going to happen.

1301
00:54:29,180 --> 00:54:30,180
Yeah, that's great.

1302
00:54:30,180 --> 00:54:32,180
A battle will ensue.

1303
00:54:32,180 --> 00:54:33,180
That's great.

1304
00:54:33,180 --> 00:54:40,180
If you throw them a foam sword and then you start hitting them ferociously with a foam

1305
00:54:40,180 --> 00:54:44,180
sword, you have made a larper.

1306
00:54:44,180 --> 00:54:45,180
Yeah.

1307
00:54:45,180 --> 00:54:47,180
Been learned to defend thyself.

1308
00:54:47,180 --> 00:54:52,180
They may not stop when you blow the whistle or whatever it is.

1309
00:54:52,180 --> 00:54:55,180
The ocarina.

1310
00:54:55,180 --> 00:55:01,180
There will be a role that is being played in a live action setting.

1311
00:55:01,180 --> 00:55:03,180
So very true.

1312
00:55:03,180 --> 00:55:05,180
I mean, how many people?

1313
00:55:05,180 --> 00:55:07,180
How far is Toledo from here?

1314
00:55:07,180 --> 00:55:08,180
That's about an hour's drive.

1315
00:55:08,180 --> 00:55:09,180
How many people here?

1316
00:55:09,180 --> 00:55:10,180
Hold on.

1317
00:55:10,180 --> 00:55:12,180
How many people here live in Toledo?

1318
00:55:12,180 --> 00:55:17,180
I think your group probably expanded by at least one to two people tonight if I was

1319
00:55:17,180 --> 00:55:18,180
guessing.

1320
00:55:18,180 --> 00:55:20,180
How can they join the group?

1321
00:55:20,180 --> 00:55:25,180
I have a Facebook group called Bright River.

1322
00:55:25,180 --> 00:55:28,180
We meet on Wildwood every Saturday at two.

1323
00:55:28,180 --> 00:55:29,180
This is it.

1324
00:55:29,180 --> 00:55:31,180
We're turning this show into Craigslist.

1325
00:55:31,180 --> 00:55:32,180
I love it.

1326
00:55:32,180 --> 00:55:33,180
Thank you, Belle.

1327
00:55:33,180 --> 00:55:34,180
Does that help?

1328
00:55:34,180 --> 00:55:35,180
I know it helps.

1329
00:55:35,180 --> 00:55:36,180
That absolutely helps.

1330
00:55:36,180 --> 00:55:37,180
Thank you so much, brothers.

1331
00:55:37,180 --> 00:55:39,180
Thank you.

1332
00:55:39,180 --> 00:55:40,180
Hello.

1333
00:55:40,180 --> 00:55:41,180
Hello.

1334
00:55:41,180 --> 00:55:42,180
Hello.

1335
00:55:42,180 --> 00:55:43,180
Who are you?

1336
00:55:43,180 --> 00:55:44,180
I'm Rebecca.

1337
00:55:44,180 --> 00:55:45,180
Hi, Rebecca.

1338
00:55:45,180 --> 00:55:46,180
First of all, Primo Merch.

1339
00:55:46,180 --> 00:55:48,180
Fantastic 100% podcast.

1340
00:55:48,180 --> 00:55:49,180
Thank you.

1341
00:55:49,180 --> 00:55:51,180
It's the funniest thing we will ever do.

1342
00:55:51,180 --> 00:55:54,180
It's the only T-shirt of our merch that my wife wears.

1343
00:55:54,180 --> 00:55:55,180
Yeah.

1344
00:55:55,180 --> 00:55:56,180
It's very good.

1345
00:55:56,180 --> 00:55:57,180
Okay.

1346
00:55:57,180 --> 00:55:58,180
Sorry.

1347
00:55:58,180 --> 00:55:59,180
What's your question?

1348
00:55:59,180 --> 00:56:01,180
So, I recently got an e-scooter.

1349
00:56:01,180 --> 00:56:02,180
Yes.

1350
00:56:02,180 --> 00:56:03,180
Nice.

1351
00:56:03,180 --> 00:56:08,460
I'm wondering when I see other people out in the world on their e-scooters how I should

1352
00:56:08,460 --> 00:56:09,460
greet them.

1353
00:56:09,460 --> 00:56:13,780
Yeah, sure.

1354
00:56:13,780 --> 00:56:18,380
When you say e-scooter, this isn't like, I'm sorry, lime or like that kind of thing.

1355
00:56:18,380 --> 00:56:19,380
Like you.

1356
00:56:19,380 --> 00:56:20,380
You own this shit.

1357
00:56:20,380 --> 00:56:21,380
I own it.

1358
00:56:21,380 --> 00:56:22,380
Yeah.

1359
00:56:22,380 --> 00:56:23,380
You customize it?

1360
00:56:23,380 --> 00:56:24,380
You put a hemi on that bad boy?

1361
00:56:24,380 --> 00:56:26,380
Or do you put just like streamers on the handlebars?

1362
00:56:26,380 --> 00:56:29,380
You all got those scooters around here?

1363
00:56:29,380 --> 00:56:30,380
Yeah.

1364
00:56:30,380 --> 00:56:32,380
I know how I'm getting home tonight.

1365
00:56:32,380 --> 00:56:33,380
Nice.

1366
00:56:33,380 --> 00:56:34,380
Real nice.

1367
00:56:34,380 --> 00:56:43,180
I know more than one person who has exploded their collarbone on an e-scooter.

1368
00:56:43,180 --> 00:56:46,060
But I don't know if that's a part of the culture or not.

1369
00:56:46,060 --> 00:56:49,900
But you like high-five collarbones in mid-air as you pass each other.

1370
00:56:49,900 --> 00:56:54,780
Or just like when you both sound the same but just go, oh, fuck.

1371
00:56:54,780 --> 00:56:55,780
My collarbone.

1372
00:56:55,780 --> 00:56:56,780
Yeah.

1373
00:56:56,780 --> 00:56:59,420
Anybody up here have any electric vehicles?

1374
00:56:59,420 --> 00:57:01,580
I have an electronic bicycle now.

1375
00:57:01,580 --> 00:57:05,060
How do you greet other people with an electronic bicycle?

1376
00:57:05,060 --> 00:57:07,500
Except for running into them.

1377
00:57:07,500 --> 00:57:12,140
I usually slow way down until they're out of line of sight.

1378
00:57:12,140 --> 00:57:15,460
Because I think they probably know what they're doing way better than me.

1379
00:57:15,460 --> 00:57:16,460
Okay.

1380
00:57:16,460 --> 00:57:17,460
Can I tell you guys?

1381
00:57:17,460 --> 00:57:21,220
So BB is dying to get a skateboard.

1382
00:57:21,220 --> 00:57:24,580
And I've started entertaining it and said, yeah, I'll look for one that's like good for

1383
00:57:24,580 --> 00:57:25,580
six-year-olds.

1384
00:57:25,580 --> 00:57:30,540
And then I realized I have zero percent information on how to ride a scooter.

1385
00:57:30,540 --> 00:57:34,540
I might have to hire somebody to teach you how to skateboard.

1386
00:57:34,540 --> 00:57:35,540
Please record it, Travis.

1387
00:57:35,540 --> 00:57:36,540
No.

1388
00:57:36,540 --> 00:57:40,940
To teach my daughter how to skateboard as I stand off to the side going, you're doing

1389
00:57:40,940 --> 00:57:41,940
great, champ.

1390
00:57:41,940 --> 00:57:42,940
Oh, man.

1391
00:57:42,940 --> 00:57:43,940
No.

1392
00:57:43,940 --> 00:57:44,940
You have to do it and also record that.

1393
00:57:44,940 --> 00:57:47,860
Because I don't want to see you be like, oh, I don't know, Christ hair.

1394
00:57:47,860 --> 00:57:48,860
What if I'm amazing at it?

1395
00:57:48,860 --> 00:57:49,860
What if you're really good?

1396
00:57:49,860 --> 00:57:50,860
Do you do many tricks?

1397
00:57:50,860 --> 00:57:51,860
Do you know many tricks?

1398
00:57:51,860 --> 00:57:52,860
How many tricks do you know?

1399
00:57:52,860 --> 00:57:58,500
Um, it, the scooter like fell out from under me the other day and I, I feel like I-

1400
00:57:58,500 --> 00:57:59,500
Half?

1401
00:57:59,500 --> 00:58:00,500
Well, no.

1402
00:58:00,500 --> 00:58:01,500
Okay.

1403
00:58:01,500 --> 00:58:02,500
But yeah, it's a scooter.

1404
00:58:02,500 --> 00:58:03,500
It's an electronic scooter.

1405
00:58:03,500 --> 00:58:04,500
That's what it, that's what they do.

1406
00:58:04,500 --> 00:58:05,500
But you're still here.

1407
00:58:05,500 --> 00:58:06,500
So, trick.

1408
00:58:06,500 --> 00:58:07,500
Yeah.

1409
00:58:07,500 --> 00:58:08,500
That's a trick.

1410
00:58:08,500 --> 00:58:09,500
Like I landed well, I think.

1411
00:58:09,500 --> 00:58:10,500
You defied death.

1412
00:58:10,500 --> 00:58:11,500
Yeah, exactly.

1413
00:58:11,500 --> 00:58:12,500
Yeah.

1414
00:58:12,500 --> 00:58:13,500
How many times do you see someone on an electric?

1415
00:58:13,500 --> 00:58:14,500
Actually a lot.

1416
00:58:14,500 --> 00:58:15,500
Yeah.

1417
00:58:15,500 --> 00:58:16,500
And I feel like I try to like, be like, yeah, another scooter.

1418
00:58:16,500 --> 00:58:17,500
Wait, hold on.

1419
00:58:17,500 --> 00:58:18,500
No, no, no.

1420
00:58:18,500 --> 00:58:19,500
This is important.

1421
00:58:19,500 --> 00:58:20,500
What's your usual?

1422
00:58:20,500 --> 00:58:21,500
Give me, yeah.

1423
00:58:21,500 --> 00:58:22,500
What's your usual?

1424
00:58:22,500 --> 00:58:24,500
I try, I try to be like, you know, like a little nod.

1425
00:58:24,500 --> 00:58:25,500
Okay.

1426
00:58:25,500 --> 00:58:30,020
Because the first thing you did for the people at home, the first thing you did when showing

1427
00:58:30,020 --> 00:58:32,500
it was like a deep court jester bow.

1428
00:58:32,500 --> 00:58:33,500
Yeah.

1429
00:58:33,500 --> 00:58:36,500
And that could work.

1430
00:58:36,500 --> 00:58:42,820
I, you're coming at this the wrong way because you're saying to us, when I see other people

1431
00:58:42,820 --> 00:58:49,700
on e-scooters, how can I ingratiate myself and form a human bond with them and not like,

1432
00:58:49,700 --> 00:58:53,980
how do I intimidate and scare every other person?

1433
00:58:53,980 --> 00:58:58,660
Who dares try to grind my block?

1434
00:58:58,660 --> 00:59:01,180
Get extremely territorial, Rebecca.

1435
00:59:01,180 --> 00:59:02,180
Yeah.

1436
00:59:02,180 --> 00:59:03,180
That's the first thing.

1437
00:59:03,180 --> 00:59:06,560
If you see anyone fucking scooting in your block.

1438
00:59:06,560 --> 00:59:08,360
You take their battery or whatever.

1439
00:59:08,360 --> 00:59:13,020
Take their battery or whatever it is that powers those things.

1440
00:59:13,020 --> 00:59:15,060
Wease their juice as it were.

1441
00:59:15,060 --> 00:59:16,060
Does that help?

1442
00:59:16,060 --> 00:59:17,060
Yeah, that's really good.

1443
00:59:17,060 --> 00:59:18,060
Thank you, Rebecca.

1444
00:59:18,060 --> 00:59:19,060
Thank you.

1445
00:59:19,060 --> 00:59:20,060
Thank you.

1446
00:59:20,060 --> 00:59:21,060
Thank you.

1447
00:59:21,060 --> 00:59:26,860
So this is when we wrap up, if we could bring down the lights, but first I want to say our

1448
00:59:26,860 --> 00:59:29,300
poster by Kaley Turvo.

1449
00:59:29,300 --> 00:59:30,300
Yes.

1450
00:59:30,300 --> 00:59:31,300
Really good.

1451
00:59:31,300 --> 00:59:32,300
And you can buy them in the lobby.

1452
00:59:32,300 --> 00:59:34,300
It's one of the best posters we've ever had.

1453
00:59:34,300 --> 00:59:35,300
Sure.

1454
00:59:35,300 --> 00:59:36,700
Upsetting in a fun, good way.

1455
00:59:36,700 --> 00:59:38,500
But that's my whole aesthetic.

1456
00:59:38,500 --> 00:59:39,500
Sure.

1457
00:59:39,500 --> 00:59:40,500
Yes.

1458
00:59:40,500 --> 00:59:41,500
Yes.

1459
00:59:41,500 --> 00:59:42,500
So those are available.

1460
00:59:42,500 --> 00:59:43,500
You can buy those.

1461
00:59:43,500 --> 00:59:44,500
Limited time only.

1462
00:59:44,500 --> 00:59:48,860
Thank you so much to the Masonic Temple here for having us and they're beautiful.

1463
00:59:48,860 --> 00:59:49,860
You guys see these fixtures?

1464
00:59:49,860 --> 00:59:50,860
Oh my God.

1465
00:59:50,860 --> 00:59:51,860
Did you see these fixtures?

1466
00:59:51,860 --> 00:59:54,860
When the lights come up later, make sure you look.

1467
00:59:54,860 --> 00:59:56,860
I'm sure you've probably looked before.

1468
00:59:56,860 --> 00:59:59,140
Thank you for letting us back into your city.

1469
00:59:59,140 --> 01:00:00,140
Yeah.

1470
01:00:00,140 --> 01:00:01,140
I really appreciate it.

1471
01:00:01,140 --> 01:00:04,140
It was, there were some tense moments.

1472
01:00:04,140 --> 01:00:05,140
Yeah.

1473
01:00:05,140 --> 01:00:06,140
It was touch and go.

1474
01:00:06,140 --> 01:00:09,540
We're supposed to do another show here at some point and then gosh dang COVID happened,

1475
01:00:09,540 --> 01:00:10,540
I think.

1476
01:00:10,540 --> 01:00:11,540
Yeah.

1477
01:00:11,540 --> 01:00:12,540
Yeah, man.

1478
01:00:12,540 --> 01:00:13,540
Shook out.

1479
01:00:13,540 --> 01:00:14,540
Anybody else?

1480
01:00:14,540 --> 01:00:15,540
Thanks Montane.

1481
01:00:15,540 --> 01:00:19,060
Thank you to Amanda and Rachel and Paul and our dad and Sawbones.

1482
01:00:19,060 --> 01:00:20,060
Yeah.

1483
01:00:20,060 --> 01:00:21,940
All of whom we couldn't do the show without.

1484
01:00:21,940 --> 01:00:27,100
Thank you to Montane for the use of our theme song, My Life is Better with you.

1485
01:00:27,100 --> 01:00:28,860
Yes.

1486
01:00:28,860 --> 01:00:30,380
And thanks to you.

1487
01:00:30,380 --> 01:00:32,380
Thanks to you for coming, giving us a second chance.

1488
01:00:32,380 --> 01:00:36,940
I hope we didn't fucking blow it.

1489
01:00:36,940 --> 01:00:43,820
Griffin, do you have any final thoughts for everybody?

1490
01:00:43,820 --> 01:00:44,820
Yeah.

1491
01:00:44,820 --> 01:00:46,500
Yeah, for sure.

1492
01:00:46,500 --> 01:00:47,980
Don't say May the force be with you.

1493
01:00:47,980 --> 01:00:49,900
No, I won't say that.

1494
01:00:49,900 --> 01:00:54,820
But if you, hey, it's me, Griffin.

1495
01:00:54,820 --> 01:01:00,100
If you say you're going to do something, then do it.

1496
01:01:00,100 --> 01:01:03,620
Don't say you're going to try to do it.

1497
01:01:03,620 --> 01:01:05,380
What is Justin McElroy?

1498
01:01:05,380 --> 01:01:06,940
No, hold on, let Griffin keep going.

1499
01:01:06,940 --> 01:01:07,940
No, no.

1500
01:01:07,940 --> 01:01:08,940
Why not try?

1501
01:01:08,940 --> 01:01:12,740
Because you won't do it, man.

1502
01:01:12,740 --> 01:01:13,740
Yeah.

1503
01:01:13,740 --> 01:01:14,860
My name is Justin McElroy.

1504
01:01:14,860 --> 01:01:17,060
I'm Travis McElroy.

1505
01:01:17,060 --> 01:01:18,060
Griffin McElroy.

1506
01:01:18,060 --> 01:01:21,060
This has been My Brother, My Brother, My Kids, Your Dad score on the left!

1507
01:01:48,060 --> 01:01:53,060
This has been My Brother, My Brother, My Kids, Your Dad score on the left!
